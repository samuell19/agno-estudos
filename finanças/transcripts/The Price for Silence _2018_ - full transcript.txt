What is wrong with you? Damn, you crazy bitch. Sorry. Bad dream. You're fucking psycho, you know that? Does that mean you don't want to go again? Jonni, I'm name is Jonni. Hell no, I don't want to go again with you. You're fuckin' crazy. Suit yourself. Fuck. Hey buddy. Hey. He's ready for you now, Kira. - Thanks, Deana. - Yeah. How long are you in town for this time? Oh, it depends. Hopefully not as long as last time but you know how it is with family. But at least I have this place to come back to and make a few bucks. How's your little brother doing? My little brother is six foot-five now and he's going to Dartmouth like I did, so. I remember when your brother was going into high school. - He's grown up fast. - Yeah. Sometimes they do. Yeah. Yeah, I'll go in. What I said was you were showing signs of improvement. After all this time, I should hope so. Because you're finally sticking to the program. And I still will, I promise. What about Sheila? She's one of the steps, right? I don't think I can avoid her, I have to be there. I still don't think it's a good idea. As far as we've come, I'd hate to see any regression. No, it's all good doc. A baby bird's gotta learn to fly sometime. Don't worry. We'll always have that weekend in LBI. Ow. Fuck. Hello mom. Yeah, I'll be home in a few hours. I won't be hungry. You don't even know what my... Bitch. Kira. - This is a surprise. - Hi, Mr. Martin. - Problem with the rent again? - No. I have it right here. Wow, a whole day early. I know, right? Does this mean there's a new man on the horizon? I thought I heard something last night. You know Herman's the only man for me. Speaking of which, I'm leaving town for a little while. Could you watch him for me? Of course, of course. When will you be back? It shouldn't be more than a few days. I can't leave Herman for too long. All right, well you take care of yourself. Thanks, you too, and him. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. - What's up, slut? - Not much. What's up with you, fag? What? It's not my fault he likes cock as much as I do. She's right mom, it's not her fault. I don't want that kind of language in this house. Oh, we'll go out on the porch. I don't care where you go, I just don't want you to talk like that in front of me. Whatever you say. - You're so skinny, I love it. - Do you like it? - Yeah, it suits you. - Thanks. - Light packing, no? - Yeah, you know me. Less clothes, more fun. I'm sorry. I don't know about you but I am starving. Dinner should be about ready. So why don't you two go wash up? Okay? It's good to see you, sis. You too, Lucas. Kira, I put fresh sheets on the bed for you. Thanks. Hash-tastic. I'm being serious. Oh yum. Not too much. Yum. - Mac and cheese. - It's your favorite. When I was like 12. Let's see here. What's with that? Oh, don't ask. She hasn't even started to go through anything yet. You mean nothing's been touched? It's like a freakin' museum. Okay. No, no. Lucas. Dear Lord, please bless this food and bring strength and dignity and grace to the Flynn family for this very difficult week, amen. Okay. - Yummy. - So, how you been Kira? I feel like we haven't spoken in ages. That's because we haven't. Well whose fault is that? I don't know mom, do you really wanna talk about it? Well, I'm glad you're home. It just doesn't seem the same here without you. It's been well over a decade. You should be used to it by now. So honey, do you want me to tell her or do you want to? - Tell me what? - It's nothing. Don't be modest, your brother got his first showing at a new art gallery in town. He's gonna be the first artist showcased. Your painting, why didn't you tell me? It's really not a big deal. A three week gallery showing is a very big deal. - Mom. - What? Can't I be proud of one of my children. Wow. That's great. Can I see some of your work? Sure if you want, later. If they're anything like your old cat drawings, I'm sure they're fabulous. Okay enough taking, you need to eat. - Look at you, you're so skinny. - I'm on a diet. Now what kind of diet would you need to be on? Liquid. Better make it last, it's all we got. I find that hard to believe. New house rules, doctor's orders. I forgot the vegetables. Eat up. After those vegetables, we're going out. Whatever you say, sis. God. It's like time stood still in here. Remind you of anyone? Yeah. I blew Joe Forte in that corner. You're not the only one. What? GI Joe, you too? You know what they say, don't ask, don't tell. Oh man, that was lame. Oh, oh, we're gonna need something much stronger than this. You got it. Nothing's changed. Thanks. - Yeah, thanks Devon. - My pleasure. Thanks, Devon. Just drink. To being old. To being an ass. Oh man. I'll take another. Ah yeah, one more. Does Davenport still own this place? Yeah and just about every other place now too. God, how can you stay here? What can I say, I'm a work in progress. So... Shh, shh. Oh whoa, slow down, it's a marathon not... Don't kid yourself, it's always a sprint. I got you, doll. It's Kira. I've got you, Kira. It's Kira. She's cute, come on. Jesus Christ what'd you do? Look at you, you're a mess. It's my girlfriend from work, just one of the nurses. All right, all right, fine. I'm proud of you. All right, that's it. Okay. Mister big time artist, I want you to paint a picture just for me. - What? No. - Yeah. I want to commission you to paint a picture just for me. You can't afford me. And I don't have any paint. Ooh. Whoa, money bags, holy shit. Consider yourself officially hired. Well, I mean... And you can draw something but make it good. I want you to dazzle me. I am broke, so I'll take your one dollar. How can you be broke? You live at home. Old habits. Okay, let's do this. Oh, are you gonna do me? Do I look good? - I don't wanna lie. - I look drunk? - Wait, wait, should I pose? - Go on. - How's that? - Too much. - That's weird. - Get it? Don't ever do that again. Well, done. Let me see it. What is it? I call it Artist and the Slut. Which one am I, the artist or the slut? Both, based on your past history. I mean in the picture. I don't think it really matters. I do. Look, if that one's me, I have a much better ass than that. - That is debatable. - What is that? What's coming out of your ass? I don't wanna tell ya. - I don't think it's... - Oh my god, Kira? - Is that you? - Hey. - Hey. - Rachel. Wow, it's been forever, what are you doing here? You know me, I just really miss this place. We've been drinking a lot. Yeah. And our fuckin' dad died, so. I heard, I'm so sorry. It was bound to happen sooner or later. - Kira. - Hey Brianne. Hey. You're still with Darren, shocker. Hey, what's up? Yeah and he put a ring on it. Oh. Oh, he put a ring on it, Beyonce. Snap. I'm just kidding, it's very pretty. - Yeah, well congrats. - It's pretty. Thank you. But you know, you should be pretty careful with that 'cause you don't know where it's been. She's joking. What? Let's go. What I mean is that Darren really likes to have things shoved up his ass. - What are you talking about? - She's joking. No, no, no, no, or hasn't he done that with you yet? No no no, come on, all good relationships are about give and take, right Darren? - You bitch. - Cool down. - Yeah, cool down Darren. - Oh shit. Get the fuck off of me. Fuck you. Hey. Asshole. You fuckin' punched me, you pussy. Real nice, Kira. Fuck you guys. Goddammit it. I told you, she's a fuckin' bitch. - Jesus. - Fuckin' mess. It's all over your shirt. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I got it. I'm hungry. There was nowhere else open to go. I can't believe I got punched 'cause of you. - I'm sorry. - I oughta punch you. I didn't mean, you're not gonna punch me. Yeah I will, in the boobs. Can you tuck me in, you know like you used to? Tell me a story. Okay. - Come on. - Why don't you go to bed? - I'll be right there. - Yeah, I'm going. So, how's work? What work? The catering company, right? That was four jobs and nine months ago. It's hard to keep steady employment when you're a raging alcoholic. I'm sure it is. Enough chit-chat, tell me a story. No, I'm too tired. Maybe tomorrow. Promise? Maybe. Yes, snuggle me. I missed you, sis. You could've come home sooner, you know. Yeah. You were out drinking last night? We had a few. You know what we need to do today. Yeah, so? So you're in no condition to see anyone. Exactly what condition do I need to be in? Dad's dead. He didn't care what shape I was in anyway. Don't you dare disrespect your father that way. When do we need to leave, mom? I'd like to leave by four. I still need to make a few last minute arrangements. I'll make sure we're ready. Thank you. I'll finish getting ready. Do you always have to wind her up like that? A girl's gotta have a little fun. I thought that was something you were working on. Yeah. It's not a switch I can just turn on and off. Like you said, old habits. Yeah well, try harder, if not for her then for me, okay? - I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you. Thank you for coming, it means so much to us. Of course, if there's anything I can do for you Mrs. Flynn... It seems like just yesterday that you and Kira were in high school, fighting over the boys. - I have work. - We've gotta go. - I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you. I told you she wouldn't be here, especially after last night. Yeah so let's get outta here before she shows up. - I'll see you after work. - Yeah. Hey, - Darren. - Oh shit. - Wait up. - Leave me alone. Hey, I'm surprised you came. It wasn't my idea, Brianne said we should pay our respects since you used to be friends and all. I told her you're fucking nuts. Ah, don't be mad. I was only playing, you used to like it when we played. Don't touch me. Come on. There's gotta be something I can do. Let me make it up to you. Come on. - He loved you. - You were a great son to him. Sheila. Thank you Richard, it's very sweet. Thank you for coming. Lucas, you remember Mr. Davenport and Aiden. So good to see you Lucas, I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - Yes, very sorry. Richard was a very good friend to your father and to our family. Richard's offered to cover all the expenses for the funeral. - It's the least I can do. - That's very kind of you. I've asked Richard to say a few words on your father's behalf. I just, I couldn't get through it myself. Where's Kira? I'm, I'm not really sure, Lucas, go get her please. Oh god. - Jesus. - Are you done? I don't know, are we? Your whole family's fucking nuts. - Call me. - Mom wants you inside. Do I have to? Well, this should be interesting. What the fuck is he doing here? Kira, language. He's gonna say a few things about your father. - Why him? - Because he's a friend. You really think that? Good afternoon. On behalf of Sheila and Lucas and Kira, I want to thank all of you for coming today to celebrate the life of George Flynn. Let's start with a moment of silence. - What happened to your leg? - Thank you. Well George, as you know George was a real family man. That's a nice dress though. Interesting choice for your father's wake but it suits you. He would do anything to protect them. I'll be around if you need anything. George was a fine man. A good man. We knew each other for 25 years. My dear wife Ava and I were very, very fond of him and we shared a lot of wonderful memories. But I'm sure each and every one of you has special memories of your own. Thank you. - Again, I'm so sorry. - Thank you. Richard, good seeing you. Those were such sweet things you said, thank you so much. - They came from my heart. - I know they did. How's Kira? She'll be fine, she's just having a hard time adjusting. It must be difficult for her, especially with all the issues that she's had over the years and for Lucas too of course. We'll be all right. Well I'll be here tomorrow but call me if you need anything at all. I will, thank you. Take me back to the office. I need to finish my speech. Hey. Hey. I couldn't sleep so I figured what the hell? I can do my best work when I'm exhausted or high. - So which one are you? - My lips are sealed. These are really good. It's just shit, it's shit. Most of them are. Oh. I highly doubt it if you're getting a gallery showing. Well mom was making a bigger deal out of it than it really is. I just hope I've got a couple of pieces that people actually like. Oh. I see what you're doing. Always under-promise and... - Over-deliver. - Over-deliver. Right, that was one of dad's favorites. Yeah. And never put the car in cruise control when it's raining 'cause it will hydroplane. Or always cut the, no, always hit - the cutoff man. - Hit the cutoff man. I don't even know what that means. - It's a baseball thing. - Oh, well that would be why. Hey, I know it's been a while since you were up. Oh. No. - Sorry, I didn't mean... - No. It's fine, I'm just tired, had a long night. Yeah, yeah. So no story tonight either? - Rain check. - Sure, goodnight. Hey, remember to drink some water. Shut up. I'll give you a few moments. I can't believe he's gone. He's in a better place. I'm sorry the kids didn't get here for mass. It's never been easy with them. I'm worried about you, Sheila. You're very fragile right now and I know that well, Kira can be unstable. - If you need any help... - We're gonna be fine. Thank you. Sorry mom, the car wouldn't start. That's okay. - Could you put this? - Oh, absolutely. Really? What? He would've wanted it. What he would've wanted is a bottle. Kira. We'll now deliver your loved one to his final resting place. Deliver him. That makes him sound like a pizza or something. I'll meet you at the restaurant. We appreciate everything that you've done for us Richard, really we do. And if the other situation becomes a problem, just let me know. What situation? What situation is he talking about, mom? Can we just get through today please? Is everything okay, Mr. Davenport? Everything's fine. Well I kept everything simple just like the last time. That's good. Thank you, sir. It was a beautiful service. Your father would have appreciated it. Yeah, everybody knows how much dad loved a great funeral. Not that you would know. How could you miss your father's burial service? How could you? I wouldn't have missed it if you had woken me up. Oh my god, you come home at 2:00 in the morning drunk and you're blaming me. It all makes sense, you blame me for everything else. Gee, I wonder why? How many people are we expecting for lunch? What? I've got a little bit of money, it's not much but... - I have some money. - No honey, sweetie. Thank you for offering but just I told you, Richard's taking care of everything. Of course he is. Gordon came to me one day in dire circumstances. It seems that, well the costs of a real estate deal he was working had gone completely out of control. The account had come due and as it turns out, he had leveraged just about all of his money to build a shelter by the pier. - What kind of shelter? - A women's shelter. Oh, were you involved with that? If I had been, we'd have both been in trouble. Anyway Gordon went to all of his friends to try to get help but not too many people can cover a loan that size. So when he came to me, I had a decision to make. Was it a tough decision? - Oh not really. - But it was a lot of money. Yeah but you know, money isn't everything. When you come right down to it, what's most important is to do the right thing. It's so true, Richard. Come on. Like you'd know anything about that, Dick. Excuse me, I have a phone call to make. What is the matter with you? After everything he has done for this family. Don't you think you're laying it on a little thick, mom? What? You can quit the theatrics. There's nobody in here but us. Is that what you think, that I'm faking this? That I'm enjoying this? Maybe enjoying it is a little strong. But you've always relished the attention and it looks like Richard is really giving it to you. I met your father when I was 15 years old. Oh god. Really? I've heard all of these stories before. He was the only man I've ever loved. He was the only man I've ever been with. Do you know what it's like to really love someone? To depend on someone completely? Not really. No, you don't. But I do. I lived and I breathed for your father and now he's gone. So? So, losing him, losing him feels like I'm losing everything. And if my own daughter thinks that I'm faking it, then I guess I really have. Mom, I'm sorry. It's just being home and everything else. Let's just, let's just go home. Yeah. - Yeah. - Let's go home. I told this guy short that stock, it's no good. He talks me out of it, the next day the thing goes down eight points. It was all your fault. Thank you so much for coming. Touching story earlier, truly. Wasn't it our construction company that ran the costs up on that property? ♪ Brownies ♪ ♪ Mama's famous brownies, brownies ♪ ♪ Makin' makin' brownies ♪ ♪ Don't you burn 'em ♪ - What are you two up to? - Hmm? Makin' brownies. Oh my god, not your world famous double chocolate bonanza brownies. One and the same. You haven't made them in years. We thought it was about time. All right, you have fun. I'm gonna head upstairs, I'll be back. - Everything okay? - Yeah, why? Well first you're up before me and second, you and mom are getting along. Either one is unbelievable but combined, it's just mind-blowing. Yeah. - Wonders never cease. - No seriously, what gives? I don't know, maybe I shouldn't hold onto things so tight. Wow, is that something your shrink told you? Yeah, I guess it finally sunk in. Does that mean you're staying? - Just for a little while. - Good to have you around. - Don't be sappy. - I am sappy. - What time is it? - Almost 8:00. Shit. What's the matter? I gotta bring my car to Moro's. Ooh, a little fancy for the auto shop. It's all I have. I'm gonna get a pair of flat-footers, you want a pair? I'm good, do you want me to follow? Nah. I need the workout for my ass. Could you make sure the brownies don't burn? Piece of cake. And clean up that mess? - Fine. - Thank you. Fine, I get to eat more. Sadly, he says it's the alternator and that's gonna be expensive. Okay, all right. I'll give you a call when it's ready, thanks. Kira Flynn, is that you? Hi, Mrs. Moro. Oh my good, get over here and give me a hug. How long has it been since we've seen each other? - A few years. - Oh my goodness. Oh listen, I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. - He was a great guy. - Yeah. That's what everybody says. - How's your mom doing? - She's mom. Listen, I have something in the oven so can we... Not your double chocolate bonanza brownies. - Wow, you remember those. - Are you kidding? I used to starve myself so that I could have one, or three. Well you always hid it really well. Big clothes. How about I bring some by when I pick up the car? Would you? That would be so kind, thank you. You're an angel, give me your keys. Great. And I'll call you when the car's ready. - Thank you. - All right. - Take it easy. - You too. Kira? What are you doing here? My dad bought this place a couple years back. Good people but they don't know shit about bookkeeping, so. Great, another addition to the Davenport dynasty. - Just what this town needs. - Hang on where are you going? Hang on. - Easy, I just wanted to talk. - About what? I don't know, the good old days I guess, when we were friends. I haven't seen you in years. Seeing you the other night brought back some memories. I know we were kids but it was still a crazy night. I think about it sometimes. I remember it. You used to follow me around like a puppy dog. That was before I knew any better. Yeah well, we should go for a drink or whatever while you're here. I gotta go. I'll see you around. I set the timer for the brown... Mom. Don't, I'm okay. I know but everyone needs a hug now and then. Yes we do, don't we? So you and Kira are getting along. Yeah. It's good to have my daughter back again. Maybe something good will come out of all this. I just, I hope it lasts. I wouldn't worry about that. You know I couldn't have gotten through any of this without you. I know. I figure this makes us even. You think so? Now, do you want a hand with anything? No, I'm just not ready yet. Shit. Goddammit. You need a lift? You can't walk all the way home barefoot. It'd be a shame to ruin that nice pedicure. Straight home, I promise. - Oh, a private stash. - Always be prepared. Pretty impressive for this early in the morning. Is there a question hidden behind that judgment? What happened? What makes you think something happened? Well when you left, you were practically giddy, for Kira anyway, now not so much. I shouldn't say that right now. Blurry is a good thing. Well I can't let you drink alone. Besides I've got a really important meeting later tonight, this will help me calm my nerves. Ooh God, ugh. Calm nerves. I know it's a hard time for you but you might be surprised, I'm actually a pretty good listener. I mean I know how difficult it is to deal with family. - Come on. - What? You're Aiden Davenport, Prince of the fucking... Oh yeah. It's real easy being Richard Davenport's son, yeah. You should try it sometime. Really you're just living in his shadow. I think I'd rather be my own man. - Hello? - Sheila, it's Richard. Hi Richard. I'm just checking in to see how you're doing. As good as can be expected I guess. I really appreciate everything you've done for us. I know how busy you are. The Flynns are always a priority for me. What about Kira? What about Kira? It looked like you two were having a moment yesterday, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. It's fine, it was just a misunderstanding. Kids, no matter how much you do for 'em, it never seems to be enough. I'm not sure what you mean. I just mean that Aiden and I have had our misunderstandings over the years and I've always felt that strict discipline is the most effective approach. Well they're not children, Richard. They need to be responsible for their own lives. We just need to support them as best we can. Is there anything else that I can help you with, Richard? I've really gotta get to some things. No, as long as you're okay, what more can I ask for? Make sure she brings her tonight. Of course. We're done. - What are you doing here? - Moro's numbers are a mess. I need last year's, I'm also behind on the quota. But aren't you always? - Is that your big speech? - Yes. And don't forget, we have the ribbon cutting at the pediatric clinic. - I can't, I have a meeting. - Cancel it. This is more than just a $30 million name tag. This is important for both of us. - Oh, I understand. - The girl will be there. What time? Now you be sure to tell the old man I talked you into that 60,000 mile warranty. I'll blame it on you, don't worry about that, thank you. - Take it easy, Chris. - Bye bye. Bye bye. Well hey Lucas, how are you doing? Right as rain, and how are you Mrs. Moro? You know if I felt any better, I would be you. Oh my goodness, are these what I think they are? - Yes they are. - Oh, thank you so much - and thank Kira for me. - Of course. - Is her car ready yet? - Oh yeah. Hang on, let me get the keys. Lucas, let me guess, cleaning up after Kira again? What makes you say that? I ran into her when she dropped the car off. Any news? Yes, yes. Everyone's very excited. Listen, I've got a thing later with my father but then afterwards, I'm getting some of the buyers together and we're gonna have a little drink. You, you should definitely come. I can make that work. Good. You think Kira might want to join? Maybe. Great. See what you can do. You know I will. Here you go. There anything else I can do for ya? - Oh, salad. - It's good for you. Honey, I was hoping that you could help with something. Yeah sure, what's up? Actually I was hoping you could help me go through some of the boxes with your father's things. I tried the other day, I just, I just wasn't ready, it was too hard. Of course. I mean not everything, just some of it. I don't even know what half the stuff is. Yeah. - When do you wanna do it? - Soon. You know? Are you going out again? I have to pick some things up at the store but, no. I think I'll stay in. Catch up on some reading. I'd like that. Just don't be late for dinner. Yeah, okay. Hey sweetheart, good to see you today. Hello Aiden. Let's get this started, okay? I want to thank the press and I want to thank all our friends for coming out here today, Richard? Thank you, I'd also like to introduce to you a young friend of ours who's gonna be one of the many beneficiaries of this fine center. Please say hello to Miss Ellie Foster. Her name is Emma. So it's with great pride and excitement that we now break ground for Bridgewood Hospital's newest facility, the Davenport Children's Center. Gimme a hand here. Okay, we got it? Okay, thank you. Lucas. Lucas, where the fuck have you been? Get your ass over here, get over here, get over here. Sit down, sit down, what the hell took so long? - It was my mom. - Ah, mom. No Kira, huh? Yeah, she wasn't up for it. - Who's Kira? - She's just a friend. Look, where's my manners? This is Lucas and this is Cindy and? - I'm Penny. - Penny. How could I forget, my lucky Penny? A pleasure to meet you both. So are they buyers? I love this guy. No, no no, they're not buyers. I talked to most of the buyers, they left. Cindy and Penny work for my father, they're receptionists. That's right, we're very receptive. Hey, we were just getting ready to go back to my place. The three of us, a little after party, you care to join? Actually I've not been feeling well tonight and I wasn't gonna come. - So not tonight. - I'm glad you did then. Hey ladies, I'll meet you outside. So, is one of them your girlfriend? You're cute. Listen, I have to catch you up though, I got so much to tell you. The meetings went well tonight. We should have dinner tomorrow night. - Yes? - Sure. Talk about the gallery, I'll get you ready. The music sucks here tonight. Victor, you beautiful son of bitch. - Still here, yes. - Of course I am. It's a busy city and I've got my busy signals on. Who do we have here? This my friend is the magnificent Lucas Flynn. Ah, the young man you've been telling me about. Exactly. Pleasure to meet you. Yes, I'm sure it is. Victor is one of our art buyers, he's from LA. Every once in awhile he comes over to the East Coast and slums it with us. Well I'm always looking for hidden talents and you have to tell me all about yourself because if you're as good as Aiden claims that you are, - I must know everything. - See, I told you. Well it's all true. What is? Everything good that he said is true. What did I say? I don't know, I guess I'm inspired by Dali, Frida. Child, I'm kidding, he's cute. - I know, I told you. - You know, I'm not feeling that well tonight though. - So I'm gonna head home. - Head home? That's nonsense, I got a pick me up package. - Uh-oh. - That will work for everyone. - Where are you off to? - Oh, business calls. - Come on, don't be scared. - I'm not scared. Oh yeah, that's it. Oh, oh yeah, good boy. Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh. - I was so close. - You are a sick fucker. So good. Listen, - I hate to ask. - Oh please. If you hated to ask, you wouldn't. Will you please help me pick out the pieces for the gallery tonight? Oh. Please, I really, really need this. You know I'm not good at decisions. If this showing goes well, I'll finally be able to get out of here. Okay. Thank you. Come here, come here. You're so weird. Brutal honesty. Like I'd do anything less. This one. - Really? - Yeah. It's beautiful. It should be your signature piece. I have another. - This is amazing. - Oh no, no, no, no. Holy shit. Mom went to bed early last night. I had a little extra energy. I have to put this in the showing. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. No no, yours are so much better. I actually think that you might be able to make some money off this shit. But it'll make a great story if I sell yours. Wow. Hey speaking of stories, you still owe me one. My brain is barely functioning. Not today. All right, well another time. I'm proud of you, Lucas. Thank you. - Is this everything? - Not even close. For someone who wore the same thing every day, he sure had a lot of stuff. It's from all those goddamn softball tournaments. My god, this closet is never-ending. Yeah, he was like a full blown hoarder. You should've had him on one of those TV shows or something. What are you gonna do with all this shit? I'm gonna donate most of it, you know? Keep one or two things for myself. So what about like taxes or insurance, you know financial stuff, got any ledgers? He didn't go into those games, now what I wouldn't give. - Remember that time in Arizona. - What? Barely. I was like 14 or 15 or something. - You were so beautiful. - What's that? The sunsets and the sunrises, they were so beautiful. Yeah. I remember. Can you put this one over there? - Yeah. - Sure. - Where are you going now? - I have to work tonight. Work, is that what you call it? We can't all be masters of the universe like you. You are a Davenport, I wish you'd start acting like one. Well that's funny, I thought I was. Getting our name on another building, that is the sort of thing you're interested in, isn't it? - Is this the gallery? - What, you forgot? Not all business happens during the day. Try to make sure whatever they write about you this time is positive. You got it, pop. Stop it, you're making me nervous. Oh, you're nervous? I'm freaking out here. Oh relax, look around. Everybody thinks your work is amazing. Says the sister who has way more talent. Ah, to the brother who's way too humble. Don't forget to throw a little humility my way when you're rich and famous. Once I'm out of this town, absolutely. Again. You okay? Yeah. Aiden's here. Well, yeah. - He sort of owns the gallery. - What? I probably should have told you but you seemed better lately, I didn't think it would matter. What wouldn't matter? Nothing. - It's nothing, mom. - What's wrong, honey? You know how she gets, she always needs to be the center of attention. It's getting late and I have a cab waiting out front for me, okay? So I just want to tell you how proud I am of you. Thanks mom, I'll see you in the morning. - I love you. - I love you too. So, what can I get you? - Whatever. - One whatever comin' up. All this time you knew about Aiden? Yes, I knew, how could I not? You never said anything. Neither did you, I figured you would talk to me when you were ready and you never did. - But you still stayed here. - You think I wanted to? I had no choice. You left and dad got sick. I tried to leave, believe me. Hey, what's your name beautiful? I'm Tyler. - Better get another. - Be right back. Hey, why don't you let me buy you a drink? Just leave it, I'm not in the mood. Have a drink with us, it's Charlie's birthday. Come on, he's just turned 21. Happy birthday, now fuck off. You know it's bad luck to turn down a birthday drink. I said fuck off. Let's get out of here. Let's go to Manny's, it's dollar drafts all night. No, I politely asked the lady to have a drink with us. That's no way to treat the birthday boy. - You wanna have a drink? - Yeah. Fine. Let's have a drink. So, - who wants to fuck first? - What? That's what you wanted, right? A girl all alone in a bar, she must be begging for it. No, that is not what I meant. Hell yeah it is. - Dude. - Go for it, man. Cut it out, man. Are we doing this all together or one at a time? I'm guessing one at a time. You're probably afraid of the whole group thing being too gay, right? Either way, let's get it over with, I'm tired. This ain't right Nick, let's just get outta here. Fuck you, I said I'd get you laid on your birthday, you're fucking doing it. Leave him alone, this chick's crazy. Crazy chick's the best type, come on. Fine, I'll go first. - Alley or car? - Lady's choice. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please for just a moment? Welcome to the debut exhibition of the fiercely talented Mr. Lucas Flynn. On behalf of the artist and the gallery, I'd like to say thank you for coming this evening. As you can see, Mr. Flynn's work is as good if not better than advertised and you have the privilege of first choice. So may I suggest that you choose quickly but choose wisely because these pieces will not be at this price again. Enjoy your evening. Congratulations, my boy. I do honestly believe you are going to be a big star. Thanks, Victor. I have to admit, when I arrived, I was kind of disappointed that I extended my stay. I thought that you might just be one of. - Aiden's pet projects. - I don't understand. Don't get offended, most of your work is kind of mundane. It doesn't have the sprinkle of magic all over it. However, this one, this one is masterful. It's hauntingly beautiful. You see? I don't know what to say. Well this says it all, so much potential. I mean you keep making things like this and your star is going to be so bright. You have to believe me on that one but to start I think this will help you celebrate this evening. You however should be very glad that your dad bought you this place and insisted on this one, bravo. Your father chose me? Yes. A wise investment, don't you think? Good work, my friend. Good work. You wanna hear a story? I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a girl and she had a perfect life. Friends, a family, everything you could ever ask for. Then one night, everything changed. She had a crush on a boy, so she was very excited. Especially when they were alone together. The girl was naive. A first kiss was all she wanted. She got a lot more. Please don't. She never said a word because her daddy told her not to. Good enough story for you? How could you? No, there was no happy ending. But you already knew that. Did he have a history of drug use? Lucas, Lucas, no no no, come back to mommy. Come back here, no baby, you can't leave me. No, no! Yeah but he... Was he under medical treatment or was he recovering? It's possible that an addict in recovery can overdose accidentally. Besides if it were a suicide, the subject would typically leave a note. Do something! No, nothing. Do something, Kira. Help my baby. Kira! If you can think of anything, please give us a call. Even the smallest detail can help. Detective Henson. My brother, he wasn't exactly what you'd call a happy person. I know, I met Lucas about six months ago when I first transferred in. Well, I think he was just overwhelmed by everything and he thought this was his only way out. What do you mean by everything? Is there something you know that can help? I know a lot of things, I just don't know if I can help. Well when you do know, give me a call. Mom. I know you're gonna try to find some way to blame... I don't wanna hear your voice anymore. You're goddamn right I blame you for this. Your brother was fine, I was fine, we were fine for years and then you come home. Now I have to bury a son along with my husband. - You don't know, do you? - About what? What, that you had a horrible life? That I'm a terrible mother? Of course I know, I know every time you look at me. You don't know that I was raped. What are you talking about? When I was 15, by Aiden Davenport and daddy knew all about it. You take that back, your father would never... My father knew everything and he took the Davenport's money to keep his mouth shut. Why would you say such a thing? Oh god, how do you think we could afford this house and all these things? Daddy was a fucking alcoholic. He did the best that he could, he did the best he could. Come on. Mom. He couldn't keep a job for more than six months. He took the Davenport's money just like everybody else in this town, he was bought and paid for. No, no, no. - No, no. - Yes. And no matter how much I cried while it happened or after or how many fucking nightmares I had, nobody helped me! Not daddy, not you and not Lucas. Lucas? Yeah. Poor, sweet Lucas. He knew and he lived a lie too, just to keep you happy. That's enough. A lot of good it did him. I said that's enough! I want you out of this house. So do I, mom, and as much I would love to leave... Now we will get things done, you will pack your bags and I don't ever want to see you again, ever. What? Richard was right, you poison everything you touch. - Hello? - Hey Kira, it's Deana from Dr. Shaw's office. I was just reading the paper and I am so sorry to hear about your brother. This really isn't a good time. I know. Listen if there's anything you need, even if it means finding you a new doctor, I can help with that. I appreciate that. I'm so sorry. Jesus Christ. Why can't you just leave me alone? I don't know what to say, I... Don't touch me. He was my friend and... You can see where I'd find that difficult to believe. It's true. I just, I don't understand why, why would he... - We were just beginning, we... - Just stop talking. I've got a... I really am sorry. It's about time you got home. We're gonna be late, where have you been? Lucas' wake. Was that today? Yes, it was. He's dead, do you remember that? A shame. Go get dressed, the car's in front. Yeah, I'm not going. I'm not really feeling up for it. Don't be ridiculous, the whole town will be there. You know what this means for both of us. - For you. - Excuse me? You said how much it means for us but what you really mean is how much it means for you. - It's the same thing. - No, it's not. It doesn't mean that much to me at all. Mother would have been there today. Aiden. Aiden. Thank you so much, please. What a delightful crowd, we're so happy that you came out tonight as we honor our Man of the Year, Richard Davenport. It's a wonderful event and of all the events I've done, it's actually the most recent. I'll work on that joke, Richard. Seriously I just want to say that tonight we honor this man. This town has been a beacon of hope and prosperity throughout the years and one man took it upon his back to take us through some very, very tough times and that is the man that we honor tonight. Our first ever Man of the Year. A big hand please for Richard Davenport. Thank you. Thank you Mayor Winston and Rob, don't worry, the check is in the mail. Seriously I'm very happy and very honored to be here tonight and to see all of you here. I first came to Bridgewood over 50 years ago as a young boy and I was raised here very happily. I met my beloved wife Ava here and together we built a happy life, a life that we were very proud of and although Ava is no longer with me, I plan to build the rest of my future right here in our town. Don't you mean your town? Excuse me? It's not our town. It's your town. You own all the businesses and most of the people. Ah, Kira Flynn. Well yes, yes Kira, I have to say that I have made some perspicacious investments fortunately and yes, I do have a significant stake in what happens here. Nothing happens here - without your say. - I think that... - Get the fuck off me. - What we have built here... - Are you fucking kidding me? - Is something very special. And I don't think we should let anything or anyone take it away from us. I think we should protect our future and continue to deliver on the promise of a better tomorrow. Get your fucking hands off me. I got it! I'd like you all to forgive Kira here. As many of you know, the Flynn family has been through a very difficult time and we should all give them our support in their hour of need. - Hey Devon, have you... - Oh, look who showed up. Hey Brianne, have you seen... Fuck. - Fucking bitch. - What the hell was that for? For fucking Darren. What, you didn't think I'd find out? - You are a fucking whore. - Right. I'm sorry about that, I didn't mean anything by it. Yeah yeah, sure I know, you can't help it. Your legs just spread open by themselves, they always have. Have you seen Aiden? Why, do you wanna fuck him too, for old time's sake? He hasn't been in, maybe try his apartment. - Got an address. - No. Lucas would've known. Lucas always wanted to fuck him too. You better talk to your daughter. That big fuckin' mouth of hers is gonna get her in a lot of trouble. Is it true? What? Is it true? I expected that question a long time ago. Then you shouldn't have any problems answering it. Look at your life, Sheila. George didn't give you all of this, I did. What? The man couldn't stay sober long enough to take care of himself, let alone a family. Kira was just a girl. Don't give me your melodramatic bullshit. What happened between them was a misunderstanding. Is that what you call it, a misunderstanding? A lapse in judgment, Aiden was a kid too. Mistakes happen. You've been fairly compensated. If it wasn't for me you'd have been on the street years ago. I'm calling the police. Don't be ridiculous. That was, that was 15 years ago, no one would believe you. - You'll lose everything. - I already have. I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing this for Kira and Lucas and everyone else's life you have ruined. I want people to know who you are. Don't you do this, Sheila. - Get out of my house. - Your house? - Get out of my house! - Your house? It's my house, I paid for it! It's my fuckin' house! Hey! Go. Go. He's not gonna hurt us anymore, you better go, now. You gotta go. Now. Please help me, I've been attacked. Can you please hurry? It's open. Kira. I didn't expect to see you. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment. - You want a drink? - No. What do you want? I want you to punish me. You wanna play rough, huh? Oh yeah. - Easy. - That was too hard for you? Oh fuck. Hey Kira, what the fuck are you doing? - Don't move. - Kira. Don't move. What the fuck are you doing? - I'm ending this. - Ending what? What you did to me and Lucas. I tried to help Lucas, Kira. - You know what you did. - Kira, put the fucking knife down, Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you? Are you out of your fucking mind? - All of a sudden you're crazy. - Oh, your daddy. You're out of your fucking mind, aren't you? He always cleans up your messes, Aiden, wasn't that nice? Kira, - please put the knife down. - Why? - So you can be in control? - No. I don't want anybody to get hurt. You care about me now? Like you cared about me in high school? High school, what the fuck are you talking about, high school, what? We were together, it was fun. You thought that was fun for me? I never heard any complaints. Mr. Davenport. It's Detective Henson, is everything okay? - You called the fuckin' cops? - Yes. - You called the fuckin' cops? - Mr. Davenport. Mr. Davenport. Get 'em outta here. Get the fuckin' cops outta here, no no. Get the fuck down. Drop it, get down on the ground. No no no, no no. Ah fuck, goddammit. Deana, do you have an update on the status of Kira Flynn? No sir. All right, I'll be in session for the next hour with Amanda and I know you'll see to it that we're not disturbed. Hello? Oh hi. I'm glad you called. Tell Dr. Shaw that I'm gonna come see him very soon. Thanks.
