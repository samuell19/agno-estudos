It's okay. We're right behind them. They're coming your way. Rue Cl?menceau. Two hundred metres and they're with you. Hands on your head! Both hands, damn it! Spread your legs. Look at that. He's shat himself. Your hand! Here. I searched your place. I brought you this. Thanks. When did you get out? Two years ago. And you rob a betting shop? I had no choice. I'm broke. I looked for work, but when you've got a record... I'll get 10 years for this. Not that much. I will. Re-offending. They'll really stick it to me. We've told your girlfriend. She's waiting up there. Promise you won't try anything. You've 30 minutes. - It feels strange. - What? - I grew up here. - Really? Right there on the ground floor. Lousy neighbourhood! It wasn't always this bad. Or maybe we just didn't notice. On Mardi Gras, my dad made doughnuts. He'd open the kitchen window and hand them out to all the kids. Martial was my brother's friend. RIVALS Cheat! Eat that! Stop fighting! It's him! Don't make me come down there. I don't know what's gotten into them today. - Want some? - No, thanks. - What do you want me to say? - I don't know. He's asking for a favour. I think we should help him. I don't really want to. I know what you think. He's still our brother. We can't give up on him. He hasn't had much luck. He should be given a chance. And we got lucky breaks? Dad would want us to help him. Gabriel never bothered about us. I'm not going to bother about him. Where the hell's your mother? Don't know. She told me they were going to see friends. With Jean-Louis? You're right, it's none of my business. You should tidy up a bit. What's all this mess? Show me your school report. So 10 in math, 11 in natural sciences, 9 in English... You should try harder. Are you sure I can leave you alone? I'm not a baby. Kiss your mother for me. You know, they're going to get married. Really? What do you think about that? I'm okay with it... I think. He's quite nice. That's good, then. Tell her I'll ring. What are you doing, Dad? You're not allowed up. Gaby, I'm so happy to see you. Gabriel. How are you, Dad? I've only one lung left, but it's the good one. Breathing's much easier. I thought about you every day. Here. Look. I always have it with me. It's my favourite. I don't know why. We both look good. Don't you think? We still look good. You do. Not me, not now. But I don't give a damn. Mind, there's a couple of little nurses... If they'd operated on me 10 years ago... Tell us what the doctors say instead. The doctors always say the same thing. I don't know why I bother asking you. I'd be better off asking them. I'll come with you. Here. Not very chatty, are you? It doesn't matter. The important thing is you're out. I'm not free yet. This is just a pass. Jeez, it was long! I don't suppose you've got a fag? I'm not sure it'd be good for you. You know what doctors are like, they're against everything. You might as well be dead. We can change it. Did you keep the ticket? It's great. Thanks. Thanks, Dad. - Can I put it on? - Yes, sweetheart, go ahead. So you failed your year? Yeah. You've got to work. - Yeah. - "Yeah" isn't gonna help you. - He's out all the time, of course. - Listen to your mum. Come show them who's champion. I taught him. Come here! Twist. - Can I come? - Get lost. - You're horrid. - Go and see Sabine. - Come on. - No, you can't come. You're really horrid. Does Nico really get up to a lot of tricks? Quite a few. He could have stayed. I'd have spoken to him. - Don't make me laugh! - What? You never had any trouble choosing between your dad and your girlfriend. Maybe. Look, I know it's not been easy for you. That's going to change now. As soon as I've got cash, I'll give you some. Rest assured, I won't try to get out of it. I'm glad to hear it. Thanks. How are you? Boring. 15 francs an hour. It's easy and it's a job. Two services at midday and two in the evening. Take it or leave it. I don't give a damn. I'm not interested. - Jean-Pierre? - He's dead. He was wasted by the Martelli brothers. Well, we think he was. You know how it is. Poor Jean-Pierre. - What about Fernand? - You won't see him around any more. He bought the Brasserie Berthaud. He's doing all right. He even plays bridge with the mayor. What are your plans? Do what the judge says. Keep my nose clean and find a job. - Are you all right? - Fine. Thanks. - You look beautiful. - Thanks. It's weird. - Are you happy? - Yes. Very. That's good, then. Go on, your guests are waiting. - Save a slow one for me. - I promise. Your sister's beautiful. About time you realised. Still... That's life. - How are you? - Great. Do you still work at the supermarket? I do. I'm at Saint-Priest now. - You're not hiring by any chance? - Why? - Sick of being a cop? - It's for my brother, Gabriel. - Right. The one who... - Yes. They'll release him if he finds a job. I'm trying to help him. - I'll ask. - That'd be kind. I can't guarantee anything, mind. Put it down. Turn. Have you lost an arm or what? Turn. Put it down. - It'll never fit. - Yes, it will. - No, it won't fit. - Get out of the way. See? It fits. I haven't had time to tidy up. I'll try to find you a better bed. Don't worry about it. Make yourself at home. The toilet's on the landing. Be careful, the chain's broken. You have to close the tap each time, otherwise it'll flood. - Don't forget, okay? - All right. Listen, it's fine. I'd rather be here than at Dad's. How was your first day at the supermarket? It's not exactly rocket science. Loading pallets. It's a start. You'll find something else. What's wrong, Nathalie? Don't cry. I'm missing 200 francs from my register. Don't worry. It's the second time in 10 days. Last time I had to pay 70 francs out of my own pocket. - Shall we recount it? - I've counted three times already. 200 francs isn't the end of the world. I'll get a telling-off and I might be fired. There. Now, forget about it. - No, you can't... - Forget it, I said. I must get back. We're going to the restaurant. Coming? All right. Pizza okay with you? - Fran?ois Valet? - Yes. Pleased to meet you. Fernand Lazeau. - Lazeau? - Yes. I'm Suzanne's son. In other words, I'm your brother. I've come because I have to tell you that she's dead. So what? I don't give a damn. She was our mother! She gave us life. Then she threw us out. The lousy whore! She screwed the whole neighbourhood. Have you forgotten what she did to us? No. But... I'm glad she's snuffed it. She's been dead to me for ages. We'll go to Nevers on Tuesday. If you change your mind... Your Honour, don't let my husband take my last son, Fran?ois. He's so little, he's only eight months old. He needs his mother. I want to breast-feed him. Give me custody. For his sake and mine. Dad... When I was in Nevers, I found some papers. Old letters. From Mum to the judge, when she left. And? You told us she abandoned us. In the letters, she says she wants custody of me, that she wants to take me with her. Shit. Come here. Put it under the tap. That's a nasty cut. It'll need stitches. I can see the tendon. Shit, I don't believe it. Put pressure on it. What do you want? You keep following me. I thought it was over. Jos?'s in prison, isn't he? What have I done? Nothing. - Is my phone still tapped? - Not at all. Why follow me, then? It's hard to explain. I can't tell you here. Could we go for a drink? You must be joking! You're sick. Shit. Why is it so hard to say? Right. I'm in love with you. I know it sounds stupid, but that's why I was following you. Now I've said it, I'll leave you alone. Here's Dad. - Hola, Valentine. - Hola, Dad. How are you, sweetheart? You're not too well, are you? She's got earache. - Is she feverish? - Slightly, but it's dropping. - What about you? - I'm fit as a fiddle. When are you coming home? Soon, sweetheart. Don't worry. God, you're lazy bastards. I can tell you're not used to moving your fat ass. Used to having it soft in jail, aren't you? Get your ass in gear, I've got my eye on you. - What do you want to know? - Don't get cross. - It's only natural I'm surprised. - I'm not cross. Ask away. All right, I'll tell you. I killed a guy. I got 10 years. - That's awful. - He was a bastard. He beat up a girl I was with. Don't get the wrong idea. I like you. I'm not a bad guy. I didn't say you were. I'm a bit upset, that's all. I like you, too, Gabriel. It's about the hold-up at the bank in Saint Fons and the one at the Soci?t? G?n?rale in Villeurbanne. - Don't get all excited, it's not much. - Go on. - I've got a name. Caseri. - Where can I find your Caseri? He lived with a chick in Bron. Rue Delambre. - When did she leave? - It must be three months ago. Did she leave an address to forward her mail? With me? Perhaps at the post office. - Was her boyfriend here often? - Hardly ever. He sometimes took the kid to a football match. - Where? - Near Vinatier Hospital. Remember the make of his car? It was a green one. - Green? - Well, blue. Look. The Alfa Romeo. That's Caseri. We'll know where he kips. Inspector Valet? There's a lady waiting for you. I told you I was sorry. I don't want trouble. Want to go to the cinema with me? - What? - Go to the cinema with me. In front of the Gaumont, at 7:30 p. M. That okay for you? Yes, fine. 7:30 p. m. - See you later. - Okay. I want to see you again. Paulo! Listen to you cough! You're getting old. Okay, clever clogs. Come and show me, smartass. Clown! Send him off. They're inseparable since he got out. What about yours? It's not the same. I don't see much of them. They're big. Go on! - Go easy. - We'll get him. Sorry, miss. A mate of mine managed it. He suggested I take over. It's great. Decisions are made by the town hall. It could work. At the weekend, it's packed. Chips, cold drinks... I don't feel like taking it on alone. Fancy it? You mean, be your partner? - I'm broke. - It won't take much. A lick of paint. Town hall has to pick us. If my mate puts in a word, we're top of the list. Imagine. A place of our own. - We're fresh out of jail. - True. It's not our best asset. The mayor's Catholic. Reinsertion and all that, he'll like the idea. What do you say, boss? We were together in Clairvaux. We met during a riot. A riot? One of our pals died from swallowing a fork. He screamed for hours, but the guards left him to die. It's awful. When we found out, we smashed the workshops. We stayed there until the riot police threw us out. Four people died. Gab was a ringleader. So they transferred him to Mende, the worst prison in France. But they didn't break him. He wouldn't let them. He went on hunger strike for 50 days. 50 days! Your man's a hero. You're here. - You're looking chirpy. - I'm happy. - I had a good day. How about you? - Not bad. - Not bad at all. - Not bad? You're smiling. You're in love. Is she pretty? I'm not telling you. I'm in love and she's very pretty. - What about yours? Go on. - She's magnificent! I'm glad. For both of us. It's good. I've been meaning to say something. I'm warning you, you'll probably not like it. Go ahead. I hated that you didn't come and visit me. - That's the way it was. I couldn't. - Why not? I was ashamed. I had to say it. Like you say, "That's the way it was." It doesn't change the fact that I like you. - There. - Thanks. - Thanks to you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hi. The man who just left, what did he want? - He dropped off an ad. - Could I see it, please? I'm not allowed. Yes, you are. I'm giving you permission. It'll be in the paper anyway, everyone'll read it. "Amicale de Boule Lyonnaise. Meeting on Saturday at 12 o'clock." Thanks, that's perfect. Thank you, miss. Goodbye. Wait! Should I publish the ad? Don't forget, whatever you do. Here. Somebody's coming. Dad, what are you doing here? I could die waiting for you to visit. - How are you? - So this is it? It's great. - How can I help? - No need for that, Dad. I can't sit around doing nothing. Meet Nathalie. - My father. - Pleased to meet you. - You are a very pretty girl. - Thanks. - Watch out, he's a connoisseur. - You're even prettier in his arms. My brother, Fran?ois. How do you like it? Great, isn't it? Aren't you here to work? - What do you think? - Brought your overalls? Did he tell you about his escape? Wait... - You kept that? - Of course I did. - You're handsome. - On the front page. Tell her how you made the rope. Go on, tell her. He got string from the soles of the espadrilles they sold in prison. The fools hadn't realised the soles were made with five metres of string. But how did he manage to get enough? He asked everyone in the building to gather some. Then in the evening, he'd plait it. Did it work? No, it didn't. He had to throw the rope to the other side of the wall. He got it wrong. The rope was five metres too short. - Five metres, you mean! - You tell it, then. - Five metres! Wild exaggeration. - It should have worked. All that work. It's not fair. Anyway, his rope is in the escape museum. - Does that exist? - That's saying something. They should have put him in the escape museum. - Bye. - You're not staying to eat? No, I have to go. I've got work. - Bye, brother. - Thanks for the help. Okay, here's the set-up, Touati, observation post at the top of the stairs. The others watch the village exits. Valet, Briquet, rue des ?coles. - I can't see. - There, rue des ?coles. Lardeau, Br?bant, to the west, rue Carnot. Matador, they're still inside. It's been seven minutes. Nothing yet. The driver's still in the van. Okay. Things could speed up. Stay alert. Shit, what's that? Chief... I mean, Matador. A coach has just pulled up. What the hell? A brass band is setting up in the square. I'll go take a look. Shit, we're fucked. They've left on foot. - Here. - Thanks. Pity, you did a pretty drawing. - We look like idiots. - Not for the first time. No, unfortunately. I must ask you something. - A different matter. - Go ahead. My brother has just got out. The other day, I saw two guys watching him. Know anything? We're keeping an eye on him. - Any particular reason? - Just routine. He's living with you, right? Not at my place. Just above. A maid's room. Same thing. You know your brother's record. I can't help a family member? I won't let him down now he's trying to go straight. - That's not what I'm asking. - What are you asking? Listen. Do whatever you want, but be careful. It's looking good, isn't it? I know, Mr Guersin, but we hadn't signed anything. Come on. That's too easy. I'm sorry. If it was up to me... I supported your file. Without the anonymous letters... The mayor got three. The deputy mayors, too. They didn't appreciate it. You knew about the prison. And the mayor, too. Yes. But the guy threatened to stir up the whole town. You told us it was a sure thing. Elections are coming up. The mayor won't take risks. - Who wrote the fucking letters? - You don't need to know. - He won't get the contract, either. - I don't give a shit! I just want you to keep your word. Stop pushing me around, Mr Guersin. Paulo. Paulo! Calm down. It looks better like that. Vincenot and Bouzic. You don't know them? They're from Gerland. They set up three or four years ago. They've got girls and slot machines. We're friends. They're in trouble with guys in Paris. Big trouble, if you catch my drift. They're looking for someone reliable. I can put in a word for you. - That's not a good idea. - It's up to you. Look who's here! - Good evening. - I'll leave you to it. - Up to your old tricks? - I was just passing by. Yeah, right. - Do you want a drink? - No, I have to go. I'm with clients. Bye. He's affectionate, isn't he? That's him, the guy I told you about. The one who snuffed Bazingue? Bazingue tried to steal one of his girls. He didn't like it. He smoked him. Then Bazingue's mates made his wife pay the fine. She had to hustle for them for five years. I think we should stop seeing each other. - What did I do? - Nothing. What's wrong? Is it because you feel bad about the drinks stand? It's a pity it fell through, but it's not the end of the world. - You don't get it. - Explain. It pisses me off. It pisses me off to unload pallets, to see you at the checkout. Being with you like this. It pisses me off. So you're leaving me because it pisses you off. You're right. I don't get it. It's better like this. What will you have? Nothing. I'll have a half. I swear. It's better. No, it's not. Mesrine told Commandant Broussard, "The first to shoot wins." Mesrine was shot down yesterday... Shit. Somebody shut his fucking mouth. Does he think we're pricks? They wanted to kill him, they did. Period. - Switch off, Fran?ois. - Wait a second. There, the vultures. Look at the bastards. - They're full of crap. - You don't have to watch. Shut up! Your friends are the ones who killed him! You don't know what you're talking about. There were grenades in the car. They had no choice. Don't make me laugh. It was Mesrine. You know what he's capable of. We know what you're capable of. You killed him without warning. Like a shit. I know what I'm on about. I've known the cops since I was 15. - Hey, guys. There's a great steak. - You can shove your steak, okay? When I was in the security wing, nobody came to see me. At least Mesrine was with us! He was the killer, not us. Don't get everything mixed up. Shit! You didn't end up in prison by accident. Don't forget that. Mesrine got what was coming to him. - Do you think he had a choice? - Of course he did. So did you. - Stop pretending you're a victim. - You're talking bullshit. If you believe that, you're an even bigger fool. I'm going. I've had enough. - It's all bullshit. - No, stay. We're all here. We never see each other. Fran?ois, tell him to stay. Why did you make all that fuss? I made the fuss? Okay. You know what? He can stay, I'll leave. Bye. Listen to yourselves! I didn't cook all morning for nothing. Shut up for five minutes, and let's sit down to eat. It's the polite way to act. What's this crap? Well? Answer me! I'm not in the mood. Don't piss me off! You sent the bailiff. Do you want me to be sent down again? I don't give a shit! You owe me seven years of alimony. I was in jail, remember? Anyway, I'm broke. I haven't got anything to take. I heard you had a plan. - A plan? It's fallen through. - You bring tears to my eyes. You make promises and then you forget. I won't give up. Even money can't make everything right. What do you expect me to do? I've got nothing. Even my bed came from my brother. What do you expect me to do? So you're just going to run away. Yet again. You're really a prick, Gabriel. - Shut up! - What? Don't talk like that in front of the kid. Go to your room. I hear you've found yourself a youngster. Why don't you put her on the game? Too good for that, is she? - You had no qualms about me. - Shut up. I know you, Gabriel. Don't bullshit me. I saw you in action. Shut up! - See? I'm right. - I told you to stop. You'll get the other half when it's done. There. That's them. The Rozoul brothers. They're from around Paris, Montreuil. They have a bar, La Fringale. It's a small place, always empty. They close up every evening. It's the ideal place to do them. Got the address? Any questions? We're nearly there. You'll see, it's worth it. It'd better be. See? It's beautiful, isn't it? Dad took us on holiday round here. He took his boss's delivery van, and we went camping. Gabriel and I got lost one day and ended up here. It became our place. I wanted you to see it. What? Here. It's beautiful. Thank you. I'd like us to live together. Don't answer straight away. Think about it. Do you think it could work? If we want it to, it will. Where's Valentine? I didn't bring her. She's at Mum's. Why? I'm leaving you, Jos?. - Screw you! - My mind's made up. I said, screw you! Lazaga, pipe down. Don't forget, bring Valentine next time. All right. We're done. - Hello, Corinne. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - We came to say hi. See if everything's okay. You've grown. This is for you. - Won't you let us in? - Okay. You can't stay for long. We're just going out. - We came for the kid. - What? - We came for the kid. - Show me your room. This way? Valentine, stay where you are. I'll find it on my own, then. What the hell are you doing here? What's this all about? Her dad's worried about her. We thought a family holiday would do her good. Come here, Valentine. You leave, now. We're fine. You can tell Jos?. He knows anyway. We'll go and see him in two days. No need to panic, it's just a holiday. I'm not panicking. What do you mean, holidays? She's got school. Shit! I don't know why I'm even discussing it. What are you doing? Want to stay with Uncle? Your cousins will be glad. - Get your coat. - Forget the coat. Let go of me! Let go of me! Hold her. Shut up! - Let go of Mummy. - Yeah, who is this? No, she's not here. Yeah, she's gone. Why do you want to know my name? Who the hell are you? Shit. Fucking idiot! I don't know what happened. I was on the phone. I turned around, and she'd fallen onto the table. - How is she? - She threw herself on some glass. She's bleeding badly, but she's okay. Gently. Take them in. Get their statement. Shit. We didn't do anything. It's an accident! - Are you all right? What? - Get Valentine. - How is she? - I think she's badly shocked. Don't worry. Mummy will be back soon. We'll give Grandma a ring. Hello. 3,459 francs. - Open it. - I can't. I made a mistake. I wasn't thinking straight. I've come to apologise. And to tell you I love you. Go on, open it. Do you like it? I don't know. It's beautiful. Try it on. Stop it. Will you marry me? Hold me tight again. I'll make you happy. - I already am. - Happier. - It's for me? You're sure? - It says Henri. Open it. - My God! Is it from you? - No. It's you, isn't it? You're mad. It's beautiful. Thank you. - It must have cost a bit! - He won on the horses. Look at the beautiful ring he bought. Merry Christmas, babe. We've a warrant for your brother. We're going to get him. - We wanted to let you know first. - What's he done? A robbery at the supermarket yesterday. 2,800,000 francs. Nice Christmas present. We spent Christmas together. He tipped them off. - I'm coming. - You'd better not get mixed up in this. We'd like to take a look around your place. - You must be joking. - I'm sorry. I don't like it any better than you. Shit, what an asshole! - Do you want to search me, too? - Listen, Fran?ois... Forget it. Get out of here! I get it. You've changed the lock. - You're throwing me out, then? - The sooner, the better. Straight away. - Who do you think you are? - You say that to me! Who do you think I am? Fucking hell, you used me. What are you on about? While your friends stole the money, your dumb brother could swear you were with the family. - You're right, I'm so dumb. - Am I in prison? The judge had to let me go. It makes me sick. - I really thought you'd changed. - You think you know everything, Mister Always-on-the-Right-Side, and never on mine. How can you say that? Fucking hell! Get out. I never want to see you again. The cop who's screwing a jailbird's wife wants to teach me a lesson? Is that it? Hello, Charles. - What have you got? - He works at the shop. That's not enough and you know it. The exit of the Ruby. Louison Barthes' place. This is Lionel Pucheux. He was inside with your brother. He was at the supermarket, a guard recognised the tattoo. It was bad, picking him up at yours. You think I'm covering for him? No. You're a good cop, Fran?ois. But it's awkward. What do you want? If you don't trust me, throw me out or have me transferred. I see. - Fucking hell. - You said it. It's the best solution. I'd rather settle it before the rumours start. Cat got your tongue? You agree? It's a joint decision. I'm sorry. - Where are you sending me? - You've got 10 days off. Then choose between Saint-?tienne and Annecy. Bouchet's boss in Annecy. You know him, don't you? He's a good guy. We know good guys. You're one. What difference does it make? News from the Boules players! - It's for Saturday. - Meeting in 10 minutes. You'll take time off later. Hurry up. Go! Drive! Matador 1, 2, 3, 4. This is it. Nab them as planned. Matador. Understood. Go on. Matador 3 to Matador 1. We're in position. Not too close, David. Why is he staring at me like that? I know him. He's a cop. Shit, the cops are on our tail. They've spotted us. Matador 2 to all. They've spotted us! Overtake! - Accelerate! - Overtake, for shit's sake! Matador 3, we're blocking them. Shit, we're stuck! Give yourselves up. Cover me! Stop. Don't move. Where are the fucking cuffs? It's okay. Give that to your mother. This is for you. - Thanks! - My pleasure. Got a beer in there? I'd like to come and live with you. Aren't you happy here? I'm not saying no, but things are complicated. I'll have to think about it. Understand? - There, the trump card to finish. - Poor old Loulou. - What about this? - I didn't see it. You didn't see... Can you count or not? What a bunch of losers! You should play Happy Families, guys. Count again. He's pissed off. Well done, Loulou. You're having a good time. - Are you all right? - Fine. Come here. Move over. How are you, pal? - Happy birthday. - Thanks. A glass of champagne? See you later? - Where've you been? - I was at the cinema with my boy. Let me sleep. I get up early tomorrow. - Have a lie-in with me. - Me and my cash register. Forget your cash register. You quit, didn't you know? Stop saying stupid things. Are you drunk? You'll hand in your notice first thing tomorrow. - You're not funny, Gaby. - Believe me. I've found a new job. I want you to quit the supermarket. - What's this new job? - Managing real estate. - You know nothing about that. - Yes, I do. That's what I used to do. You're crazy. I love you. Lyon, a few months later... - You look great. What's that? - Cardin. A mixture of silk and linen. Is Fran?ois here? - No, I thought he was with you. - He said he'd come to our place. - He must be late. - My ass! Have you got his number? Hello, Gaby. You're looking good, very good. Hello? I'll get him for you. It's your brother. What's happening? What's your game? Colette, Dad, everybody's here. What's going on? We're not good enough for you, is that it? Got nothing to say? Well, let me tell you something. I hope you're proud of yourself. You're hurting everyone. You're a asshole. Stay in your ivory tower! To hell with you and your grand airs. To hell with you. To hell with you, too. I love you, you love me. We'll love each other until the end of the world. Since the world is round, my love. Don't worry, my love, don't worry I'll go to England. To see the big ships. That travel round the world. Like the little birds I love you, you love me. We'll love each other until the end of the world. Since the world is round. My love, don't worry. The first stupid thing he did was rob a house with two friends. They were caught in no time. The police grabbed him in front of our house. And he couldn't help showing off. When I went to see him at Saint-Paul's, he asked me to wear several jumpers so I'd look more sturdy. So I did. I'd have done anything for him. There he was, behind bars. I watched him, still being a smart-ass. I can't remember what we said to each other. Not much. But I know it was there that I started to feel sorry for him. I was mad at him. He was my brother. I loved and admired him. He was my idol. I didn't understand why he was there and not with us. It's as if he'd abandoned me. That's the brake! - Sorry. I'm no good at this. - You're not concentrating. First you hold the right, accelerate gently. Careful, careful. Keep the wheel straight. Accelerate. - I've got something to tell you. - Wait. You're not concentrating. Hold the right. - It's important. - Wait. - If a car comes, we're in trouble. - I'm pregnant. Say that again. I'm expecting a baby. Fancy me, darling? - Come on, get in! - Oh, it's you. - It's well-situated. - Two hundred metres from the Terreaux. - How many have you got? - Here? The whole building. That's 12 apartments. Another three in a month's time. We rent you the studios and take care of the cops. If you want, you do the rest, collect the rents, check the girls are working, that they're not fighting, recruit new ones. We want nothing to do with them. Hear me? Nothing. I see. - How much for the rent? - 15,000 a week. Is that all? And my cut? State your price. 3,000. Is that all? Okay. - Are you in? - Yes, obviously. You'll see, we'll rake it in. This is just the beginning. Next Annecy, Grenoble. Shall we test it? Go on, Gaby. Fuck me. I know you want to. From now on, we have no contact. - What? - You heard. You'll put the money in a safe box and drop the key at the Rallye. If you ever try to see or ring me, I'll call the whole thing off. Understood? - What about the kids? - What about them? They've managed without me for 10 years. They can carry on. I've been turning tricks in rue Savin for 10 years. I have my regulars. They're calm. The neighbours never complain. - Then these girls try to take my spot. - Where are they from? Not from round here. I don't know any of them. - You think one of their guys hit you? - I don't know. When did these girls move in? About four months ago. Six or seven of them. They've taken over the building. - Who owns it? - The owner changed a while back. Look. That's Mrs Paturin. She's completely gaga. How on earth could she buy a building? Besides, what would she do with it? Thanks, Briquet. I owe you. Cheers. So? Mrs Paturin's nephew is a major pimp in Lyon. Another one who'll regret setting up in the region. - Are you watching the girls? - Yes. That stupid district attorney forgot to sign the documents. When my lawyer found out, he cancelled the proceedings. If you'd seen the judge's face! It was worth it just for that. It took me a while to find you. Nothing to say? Aren't you pleased? Yes. I'm happy for you. I'll get the coffee. I'll take you into town after. Where do we stand? You know very well. What do you mean? I mean, I love you. That's what I mean. I love you both. - You should think about it. - I don't need to. - I'm with somebody new. - Yeah, right, that cop. - Bit weird, isn't it? - Certainly. But that's the way it is. - He's the guy who put me away. - That's nothing to do with it. It doesn't change anything. For me, you're still my wife. I want to forget all this bullshit. I've had time to think, Corinne. I want to move to Seville. Things will be different there. I can do a lot there, but I'll need my family with me. - My family is you and Valentine. - You don't get it, do you? I don't want to start over with you. We made a mistake. The only good thing to come out of it was Valentine. So, listen, I love him. I love Fran?ois, I want to live with him. You have to accept that. - What's so great about him? - He loves me. That's all. - Like me. - No, not like you. What do you want me to do? - Kill him? - It wouldn't change anything. Valentine, come on, darling. We're going home. - I won't let you take my daughter. - Let go of me. You're hurting me. See, that's the difference. What exactly did he say? Lodge a complaint. I don't want to lodge a complaint. I want him to leave us alone. Maybe we should move. - Change towns. - There's no need to be scared. He won't dare to bother us, I'm a cop. You hear? Yes, I hear you. I hate him. - I don't want him to ruin everything. - He won't, don't worry. See you later. See the white bag on her shoulder? There, she comes out without it. Now she's got the bag. - And that's your sister-in-law? - My ex-sister-in-law. That's what I thought. It won't help our case. Don't worry. I want to be taken off the case. No, you've done most of the work. I want you to do the arrest, then we'll see about the rest. Do you think your brother's in on it? I hope not. Listen, Fran?ois, I want... No, I'd like... Fran?ois, I'd like... I'd like you to be... Listen, Fran?ois, I didn't ask you to... Listen. I'd like you to be my daughter's godfather. Please. Her name's ?lodie. She's got her mother's eyes. - She's a beautiful baby. - Yes, I'm proud of her. I think this is the best thing I've done in my life. I came because I want you to be godfather. No arguing. You didn't come to the wedding. We'll not talk about that again. But if you refuse this, you'll piss me off for good. Tell him. - I'll think about it. - You don't need to think. Just say yes. Make up your mind. - Yes. - I'm glad, I'm glad! I'll take you out to eat to celebrate. No, we'll eat here. Sit down. I'll prepare something. I'm so glad. He's an awkward beggar, isn't he? Always has been. You won't tell me who it is? No. Forget it. I'll work something out. Give me time to think. You turn up with your little mysteries. I'm thinking. All right, I'll go with you. I'd do anything for you, so don't give me "I'll work something out." - When do we eat? I'm starving. - It's coming. It's Lazaga. Jos? Lazaga. - My brother took his woman. - That's bad form. Yeah. That's my brother. I don't want anything to happen to him. I'm fond of him. I understand. No sweat. We'll waste him. Hello, Fran?ois? It's me. I can't take it any more. He's here again. Do something, please. See you later. What's up? - Are you ready? - It'll never work. It will. It's so obvious, he'll be fooled. Go now. Take it slowly. - I'll miss you... - Think of it as a holiday. Just until this passes over. Take care of yourself. I love you. Me, too. - Goodbye, Valentine. - Goodbye, Fran?ois. Move in immediately. I repeat, move in. Police, madam. - Come on out, madam. - Give us the bag, please. Shut up, they've nothing on us. Think you're clever, don't you? But you're not. What do you think is going to happen? - I don't know and I don't care! - Well, you should. The Italian girl told us everything. Procuring. You'll get at least five years. If you really are a procurer, it's a reasonable price to pay. But if you're only an intermediary, that would be stupid. We'll take you back to your cell. And you can have a think about it. Mrs Guillon, did you know the Italian girl was underage? Well, she is. - Is she underage? - No. She admitted everything. Your brother's in it up to his neck. I think it'll hold. We'll arrest him tomorrow. - I'm sorry. - I suspected as much. Here, I resign. I'll bring my letter tomorrow. Think about it, Fran?ois. You're a good cop. It'd be a pity. I've thought about this a long time. I'm sick of playing cops and robbers. Anybody there? Fran?ois, is that you? - Who was it? - Nobody. Wrong number. Go to bed. I'm coming. Don't move! All right, guys. Easy now and everything will be fine. Search him! He's not armed. Go on. - Are you alone? - No, my wife's sleeping upstairs. Let me wake her up gently. Okay, we'll both go. It was behind the safe. Is this yours? Aggravated procuring. You'll get 10 years. Changed your tactics? Ready to talk? It's not about my case. It's about my brother. There's a guy gunning for him. What's all this? A certain Lazaga. Does it ring a bell? Jos? Lazaga. Has he been out for long? Can you remember who booked him? Do you know Lazaga? - Can you identify him? - Yes. Hey, cop!
