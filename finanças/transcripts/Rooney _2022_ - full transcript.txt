I was brought up to fight for my place to play. Fight for everything. That will never leave me. Remember the name, Wayne Rooney! Now then, here's Rooney! Oh, my goodness me! Rooney! Oh, wonderful! What a goal! What a player! Wayne Rooney, out of this world! The outstanding young talent in English football, one moment of madness, sent off in a crucial World Cup tie. What people don't understand is you're 17, you're 18 years of age. You're not supposed to be able to handle this. There's gonna be mistakes made. Fifty for England, for England's all-time leading goal scorer. It's Wayne Rooney's record breaker. Are you not tired of football yet? No, no. I love it. Um... I love playing still. It's, it's what I know. I'm not stupid, I know I'm not gonna play for the next ten years. If I finish playing, I have to go into work because it would be easy to be sat in the house and say, "You know what? I've got nothing on. I can have a glass of wine here," and then no good's gonna come from that. I think that's where it's good if, if you can keep yourself busy and I know I'm in a transition period from player to coach, player to manager. I wanna try and manage at the top level and I wanna try and challenge myself, so, um... I see it all as a learning curve. Match scarf for the game now tonight. Souvenirs. Nice match day scarf here. Rooney! Rooney! The last time Manchester United won the FA Cup four years ago, Wayne Rooney was a key player for them and tonight United's all-time record goal scorer is in the opposite corner. With 253 goals in 559 appearances for the club, Rooney's legendary status at Old Trafford has long been assured. Ooh! What do you want to be remembered for? Being a good person. For me, it's important that people, in terms of teammates, coaches, friends, family, they remember me for who I am rather than what I've done. Ooh! There's stuff which has happened in the past, with girls for instance, that I've caused, stuff I regret and it's something which I feel has, has stuck against my name. I think it's important because it is part of what's happened with my life growing up and it's something which has stuck and maybe tarnished my reputation as a person. People still see them. They look at me in a different way. I'm not that person, I'm not that type of person. The love you have for each other will bind you together for life in a relationship that will influence your whole future. The future will have its ups and disappointments, its successes and failures, its pleasures and pains, its joys and sorrows. - Coleen... - Coleen... - Wear this ring... - Wear this ring... As a sign of our faith and love. As a sign of our faith and love. Mr and Mrs Wayne Rooney! I've been told to behave myself. I'm sorry, that's it. No. I've watched Wayne, studied Wayne for many years. You know, kept an eye on him and... Have you seen the film, "Meet the Fockers"? It's been like that, ain't it, Wayne? Yeah. Wayne and Coleen have been under the microscope since they were 16 years of age and they are, you know, brilliant people, the way they've handled the pressure. Whoo! What was Wayne like as a 13, 14-year-old boy? Cheeky, full of confidence. Always up to something. I always remember he used to hang around by where I lived and now and again you'd get his mum shouting up and down the street, "Wayne!" I am best friends with Wayne's cousin Claire. My dad and Claire's dad ran the local boxing gym. Our families have, have grew up together. Give us a wave! Wave for Mum. I think I was about 12, 11 or 12, I knew that I wanted to go out with her. Wanted to marry her and I said to her at the time. I said when we grow up we're gonna get married and you're gonna have, um, our kids. And she was looking at me like, "Yeah, good one!" He's a charmer. Growing up, that's, I think, that's how he won me over. The more I said no, the more he'd say I will one day, I'd get that date. Actually I was quite romantic. I used to write her poems. -Do you think she's still got those poems? -Yeah, she has, yeah. Some of them are, yeah, funny. When you look back. I haven't read a few them for a while. I remember one of them was... I remember the name of it. It was called Wiggle Wiggle. - Go on. - I can't remember how it went, honestly. There's one that says "wiggle wiggle" in but it's not... called Wiggle Wiggle, it's called something else. No, they're very romantic. But no, you can tell he loves me. Dad! -Dad. -Alright. Where did you put your uniform, Klay? -How was school? -Good. Give us your coat. -Give us your jacket. -Do you want a snack? -Do you want a wrap or...? -Bagel. Bagel. Get Kit. Coleen, does Wayne ever do the cooking? No, not... Sometimes. I put quite a bit of pepper in all my meals so... she doesn't really like it that much. Um, white pepper so it's quite strong. You can't move. Yeah, but you don't have to play it now, do you? I am! Just sit up and watch your head, please. If this was me now at his age, at seven, you'd be out in the street, you'd be playing football. You'd... I know society's changed now and kids get home from school and, even on the council estates, they're on their computers but... I'd be out all the time, where here, no one really does it. Used to live in Armill Road, Croxteth. The same road my nan used to live on. It's a great area. It's had its bad times, of course, um, with a bit of violence and stuff, but... I think the thing is if you're from there, it's not... you're living in it, you don't feel that. You don't feel it's, it's a violent place. So what was Wayne like as a kid? Naughty. Naughty. To me, not to anyone else. He was good as gold to anyone who'd take him out. He was good as gold. But to me, he was so naughty. I used to play football constantly. Used to smash things in the house with the ball. My mum would take the ball off us in the house, So I'd roll socks up and I'd be playing football with rolled up socks and she was constantly moaning, moaning! Anything to do with a ball he loved. Snooker, you should've seen him with the snooker on the telly. Be like a lunatic as a baby, wouldn't he? In his bouncy chair, he'd be like that, get all excited over the balls. Cricket, everything to do with a ball, he loves it. I remember playing at the time and... knowing I was good. At that age you do score two, three, four, five goals a game. I think I scored about 80-odd goals in the season. I remember I used to pretend to be Tony Yeboah after he scored, um, the volley against Liverpool and the volley against Wimbledon. Dorigo looking for Wallace. Now Yeboah with a chance! Oh, what a stunning goal! Back in the centre. Here he is! 3-1! Still to this day, all my friends in Liverpool, they call me Jimmy after Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. It's 'cause I scored a goal, um, which was in the local newspaper years ago, I was a kid. Jimmy Floyd used to do a cartwheel so everyone, my brothers, my cousins, my friends from back home still call me Jimmy. Now if I made a speech about the player's player, I'd be here all night because this kid is unbelievable. Since he's been with us Everton have signed him on and he'll probably be the next England player, Mr Wayne Rooney. Come on, Wayne. Well done, Wayne. Me two younger brothers, Graham and John, all three of us were at Everton. So after school we'd get two or three buses to get to training, so my mum'd have to wait and wait round for three training sessions basically to finish and some days it was freezing, um... It was pissing down with rain and so for my mum to do it, in terms of getting the bus, it must have been a really difficult time. Stick the thing at the front. I always remember my dad, he used to go to the pub on a Friday or Saturday night and I used to always say to him, bring me some food in when you come home. So I'd, I'd be in bed and I'd be waiting for him to get home. I'd come down the stairs and he'd let me sit up and have some food with him. I used to love it. That was like my, my time with my dad. Um, without the other kids being round. It's recording now. My mum'd be the one to discipline us really. Whereas my dad'd be more, um, anything which went really too far. I've had full-on arguments with my dad when I was younger which, looking back, I was bad for the way I spoke to my dad. I shouldn't speak to my dad the way I did. And then, yeah, we'd, we'd argue and he'd give me a slap. Can you remember doing something that got you a whack like that? Yeah, I remember I was going fishing, um... and I asked my dad for some money because we were staying overnight, um, fishing... I think I was about 14. He gave me one pound, so I remember looking at it, then I looked back at my dad and said, "What's that? What am I meant to do with that?" And he's given me a clip, yeah. I think the thing is, my mum and dad growing up, um, we were never a rich family. We had the majority of stuff we needed. My dad worked really hard trying to provide for us as a family and obviously it weren't always easy. Yeah, he probably felt I was, um, disrespecting him and what he'd done by questioning the amount of money he gave me. I remember when I got the job at Everton, somebody said to me, "You're a real lucky bugger, you. There's a young boy in the academy called Wayne Rooney." I says, "Oh, is there?" you know. But let me tell you, he was an incredible talent. And Wayne Rooney gets his eighth goal in the FA Youth Cup. Once a blue, always a blue. At that time, Wayne was still at school though. He was a shy boy really and he was a boy. He was just a, just a kid who loved playing football. One of the first things I asked you when you came up here was how good can he be? You just said, "He's gonna be brilliant." You've gotta remember he's 16. And he's got a lot to develop, he's not had any full-time training whatsoever yet. It's very important we don't say too much about him, to tell you the truth. But it's great to see for the supporters and great to see as a manager when you see a boy so committed to the football club. Oh, dear! Rooney, well... The other bit that I liked about Wayne is Rooney's a real street footballer. Brought up playing outside, playing in the roads, and playing with the bigger boys in the park and whatnot. Wayne was exactly that. Wayne was right off the streets as far as football goes. But in the same breath, he was right off the streets as well, as far as we know what goes on in the streets, and if that was drinking then Wayne would've been involved. Well done, it's been a fantastic campaign. You yourself have played very well in both games and you're our Player of the Final. Thanks. Thanks. One day, I was crossing over the road and Colin Harvey, who was me coach at the time... Um, I was crossing over with a bottle of cider, um, and he, he stopped to let me cross over. And obviously, I looked at him and realised it was him. I was like, "Oh, shit!" Um, next day he pulled me in in training and said, "Listen, you've got the biggest talent I've ever seen for anyone your age. Don't waste it." I was 16. I think that's an important time in your life because that's when, certainly if you want to go into football, that's really when you have to make a decision. Lads are out drinking and you're under pressure. The lads are all saying, "Oh, come on, just stay out," and... But you don't, you go home and you focus on your training. And it is difficult. It's very difficult to make that decision. Well, I weren't the nicest kid, um, at that age. Just things I done which were wrong. I think I had a lot of fights, um, street fights when I was younger. I wouldn't say I was a bully but I'd say there was some things I done which I shouldn't have done and crossed the line, um, looking back now. I don't know whether it was an anger or there was an enjoyment in it. But obviously sometimes you, you get hit and it's not nice, but I used to, um, get some sort of enjoyment out of it. I remember growing up, I used to go to a lot of concerts. A lot of Travis concerts, Stereophonics, um, Cast, who was a Liverpool band. Yeah, and again there was normally a lot of fighting at the end of it. You can imagine in the middle of the mosh pit and there's probably about fifteen of us, all Scousers, and, um, you could be in the middle of Manchester. Always ended up being a fight between someone, yeah. I remember, I got my jaw snapped in Manchester. I was about 13. And some guy, he grabbed hold of me and he hit me. He went to hit me again and I ducked, and I just threw a big haymaker at him, caught him and then I ran off. So would you go like to the concerts knowing that you were gonna fight at the end? - That's really why you... - Not knowing, no. But we knew there was a chance. We used to go up to Southport and fight a lot as well, so I've come back from Southport with my eye all stitched up, and, um, again my mum weren't happy, so... How old were you then? I was probably about 12. You get taught you have to fight to survive, and I don't mean physically fight, but you have to fight. You get taught you have to work harder than everyone else. It's almost like that we're not gonna get any favours really from... from the government or from any people in power that... You have to make your own way of, of living. And I think for kids at that age who do have any sort of goal or ambitions, you can take it too literally that you have to fight. Do you know what I mean? And, um... I think sometimes that did boil over and that did happen. You're always trying to treat them correctly and you're always trying to make sure that you bring them up right, because you're worried about them, you know. You think of the amount of boys who've gone off the rails at 15, 16, 17. So my intention was to make sure that there was no chance Wayne Rooney could go off the rails. When I got in the Everton squad, I went into that first week's training and knew I was the best player at 16, knew I was better than all of them. Right, okay. Come on, let's go then. Yeah, I'll do it. I played against him as a 16 year old in a reserve team game. He booted me and David May. I couldn't believe it. I knew he was like a... I knew he was a dirty little bastard. Played like he was a street kid from the minute he came into Everton. Fought for every ball, jumped for every header, went full blooded into every tackle. Defended for his life, attacked for his life and just threw everything on the football pitch. And you align that with the incredible talent and that's why he was so special. Number four, Patrick Vieira. Number eight, Freddie Ljungberg. Number 12, Lauren. Number 14, Thierry Henry. Obviously, Everton v Arsenal. Number 19, Gilberto. People talk in the game, you know, there's a young kid at Everton that, you know, scores goals. He has the body of a man. But when I saw him I was like, "Whoa, how old is he?!" You know, "16?" And then you looked at his body and you could see the power. Just see him walking. You know, sometimes when you catch eyes with players, straight away you know what they're about, and you could see that with Wayne Rooney. You looked at him, you knew he wanted to succeed. He wanted to destroy everything that was in front of him. Number 18, Wayne Rooney. Amongst the substitutes, Wayne Rooney, who'll celebrate his 17th birthday next week by signing a three-year professional contract with Everton. That was my last game, um, as a 16 year old. I was beating myself up over it thinking, I want to score as a 16 year old. I was on the bench, sort of thinking, "No chance." Playing against the best team in the league. 30-odd games unbeaten. Vieira, Sol Campbell, Henry. I was in awe and I was thinking, "Fucking hell, there's David Seaman. There's all these players I've watched for years." And then the one thing which I didn't realise is how big they all were. They were massive. I was thinking, "Fuck me, these are absolutely huge." Listen at the time, when we played Everton, people expect us to win there. But Wayne Rooney doesn't, or didn't, care about who was playing against him. When he was playing he was in a survival mode. You know, "I'm here to stay." You know, "You're gonna like me the way I am." Rooney! Rooney! Rooney! You're always watching the clock and then I come on. ...16. And coming on, number 18, Wayne Rooney! Remember just thinking, "If I get a chance, I'm shooting." "I'm, I'm shooting from anywhere, um, if I get a chance." I always remember Sol Campbell backing off. My eyes just opened up. I could see this was my chance. It has to be perfect for it to go in. Rooney. Fancies his chances. Oh, what a brilliant goal! A brilliant goal! Remember the name, Wayne Rooney! It's premiership history. The big league's youngest ever goal scorer... signals his arrival on the big stage with a breathtaking goal to end Arsenal's unbeaten run, surely... This kid who's not even old enough to take driving lessons has just scored this goal. He's scored it over David Seaman, against the league leaders and he's put them on the verge of a defeat that nobody can remember when they last lost. And this is the youngest goal scorer in Premier League history that you're looking at. The moment though belonged to the brilliance of the goal itself. The record road ends on Merseyside and it has marked his arrival... as a major, major name in English football. Arsene, you felt your side could go unbeaten all season. That isn't the case but it's taken a real battling performance, hasn't it? Everton, was great today. They did fight for 90 minutes and in the second half, Rooney made the difference. It's a special goal and a special talent. It's the biggest English talent I've seen here since I am in England. and, I hope he will not be injured now in the next two, three years and that mentally he will be able to cope with what's happening to him, but he's a huge talent. There was just this enormous buzz around, the stadium. You know, the Evertonians had been waiting for this lad. So he was their, their, their, their messiah, if you like. And from that day forward, life was never gonna be the same again. I'm very delighted. This is my dream come true really. What does it mean to you as an Evertonian? It means a lot. Means the most important thing in life really. There is an element that he was famous so early in his life that he wasn't ready for it publicly. I remember his signing press conference for Everton when he would've been 17 and it was really difficult for him. It was the first time he'd had to speak in front of the media and he just mumbled. He wasn't able, he wasn't articulate. Um, and that kind of gave rise to the idea of him being thick. There was this rumour going around that he couldn't read or write. Um, ju... can't, can't explain it. Best feelings in my life. This young lad was like, um, a rabbit in the headlights. How many years have you signed for? - Three and a half. - Three and a half? So you're on better wages now than you were last week, are you? Or will be soon. The abuse the lad, the boy faced... was quite honestly just out of control and ridiculous. They'd set their agenda. To have that pressure put on you and... photographers following you round and... I always felt people looking at me and I just didn't want it, didn't want that to be the case. - When are the stairs going in? - The stairs are in. - No, the sides just here. - Oh, the bannisters... They looked ready, so it should be soon. I can't wait to move in. I'm looking forward to moving in but I don't come very often. I'd rather come when it's finished. I think that where it's better for Coleen because if I was the same as what Coleen is, where if I was like, attention to detail and things, then... it'd piss her off. It'd piss other people... I've asked for one room. -But I've got a little small room. -He's got a little tiny box room! That's all I want. And a snooker table. What's happening...? What's... see this metal bit here. What's happening with all this? It's all gonna be mirrored this side. And then this is gonna be like an alcove so it'll have like a candle inside. How old were you when you bought your first house then? I was 18, weren't I? And you were 17. But we moved to Formby. Um... We lived in it for about eight months. -Was it? -Was that all for? -Yes. -That short? 'Cause I moved to Man United when I was 18. Was that quite... mental for you both -going from Crocky to... -Yeah. -quite a big house in Formby? -The thought of it was all fine and great but then obviously you were away every weekend and I used to leave my mum's and cry all the way home to mine. It was all of a sudden and it was a matter of months, everything just happened. We've always grew up quicker than what, what we were meant to, really, I think. So this is what we've been waiting for. We've had to try and be more sensible than most people and be aware of situations what's going on around you. Especially with the press. The press have been a nightmare. You've gotta learn quick about it. Accept criticism. We've had some unbelievable times that everyone's knew about. And then we've had some really bad times that everyone's knew about. So it's not like you can just go and hide away and deal with it yourselves. But that's what the whole our world is, is like. It's because people think they know you and then they'll go and tell someone else, and they don't really know you that well. Do you look back? Not very often, I must say, because... I did it when I, finished after 2006. I looked back but I said to myself, "No, Sven. Don't, don't start to do that." So very seldom. We heard about him, of course, when he started to play for Everton. And the more we saw of him, you could see this will be a great player. You could think that he would be shy, nervous for the training, what will happen. But not a chance that he felt anything of that. He went in and, boom, tackled in training the big stars and he didn't say it but you saw, "Here I am. I'm ready." He had a cheeky way about him, Wazza. I hadn't seen many players like him, you know, with his strength, with his ability, with his confidence, with his goal scoring ability. Every now and again, a player does something in a training session and the whole place goes, "Whoa! That wasn't meant to happen." He shrugged off a couple of players like with strength and a bit of skill and then dinked Paul Robinson, and everyone just looked around at each other and was like... "Okay, now I get what people are talking about." It was my first start to play for my country. It was such a huge moment. I felt I was ready. I knew I was ready. I knew I was waiting to start and the other players knew that as well, and I just wanted to enjoy myself, wanted to go and play, enjoy it, and go and have fun. I had to impress to show Sven-Göran Eriksson that I should be in his next squad. No real conviction about their game yet but here's Heskey. Now Rooney's following up here! And there's conviction now! Wayne Rooney has become the youngest goal scorer in England international history. There was this primitive thing about Rooney that was one of the magical things about his emergence. He was like an unpolished diamond. There was a feeling that Rooney might be something special, something that would be perhaps the final piece that the, the golden generation needed. Okay, boys. Jamie just tuck your collar in, mate, please. Thank you. We always talk about the expectation of that era of players, you know, obviously with Stevie G, with Frank, with Rio. And then when we had Wayne coming into the team, expectation was always gonna be high. But I never doubted for one minute that Wayne couldn't handle that. Euro 2004? Enthusiastic right away? He was a hell of a player, there's nothing to say about it. But I thought it wasn't fair at one point to put everything on a guy that's 18. That expectation that he's gonna change everything for English football. But this is something that the guy had to deal with, that Wayne had to deal with early doors. Beautiful little flags. Go Portugal. Let's go 2004. In Lisbon tonight, the England team bus with the slogan "Follow the roaring lions" took the players to a heavily guarded hotel on a hill that they hope will be their home until early July. England should relax here. They've booked an entire luxury hotel for themselves. Inside, their very own amusement arcade, complete with every game that even a millionaire footballer could wish for. It's not actually till you get there, you get to your base, and you're thinking, "Right, let's go, let's do it." I remember just being excited round the hotel, just being eager to play. I was an 18-year-old kid just enjoying myself. What a finish! Come on! Come on! You do need to keep yourself occupied because you've obviously got the pressure of the country on your shoulders. - Sit in it up to your waist. - Look out. -And we time it. -Oh, sorry! How cold is that, John, by the way? Freezing. -In you go. -Go on, JT! Oh, hey! Oh! Oh! Aw! Get in! How long have we gotta go in for? Look, he's got about six inches of fur on him. He's like an otter! In Santo Tirso last night it was the last training session before heading to Lisbon. Lilian Thuram is listening to Jacques Santini and thinking about the England match. I just hope that this match doesn't become too aggressive. That's all. Lilian Thuram said that Wayne Rooney's not ready for this tournament. Now you've spent a lot of time with Wayne during these last few days. What would you say to Lilian Thuram? Is he in for a shock? I hope so. Wayne's definitely ready for this tournament. He's looking forward to this tournament more than anyone and hopefully he'll prove Lilian Thuram wrong. Euro 2004 may have kicked off in Portugal yesterday, but for thousands of England fans today is the real start of the tournament. England play France at the Stadium of Light in Lisbon later. The heart of Lisbon looks like it's been taken over by the English. Tens of thousands of fans have arrived here on trains and charter planes, confident they can beat France tonight. -2-1. -England. 2-1, Owen and Rooney. 3-1 to England. I think England are a bit underestimated compared to France. I remember in that tournament, at 18, thinking to myself, "I'm the best player in the world. There's no one better than me." And I believe at that time I was. I weren't looking, thinking, "That's Zinedine Zidane." I remember thinking, "We're gonna beat yous. We're too good for yous." It could've been Pele, Maradona and George Best on the other side. It wouldn't have mattered. Come on! Keep drinking, boys, keep drinking! Looking at the team of England right there, in the dressing room just before the game, I was like, "Wow, that team, that midfield, those two strikers... Legends of the game." This is the moment we've all been waiting for. It's la crunch. I felt like if we were gonna win the tournament, it's because of me. If we don't win it, it's because of me. Thierry Henry has spoken in the week of the lack of fear in the eyes of Wayne Rooney. Feel the tension. And England playing the ball confidently out of their own half of the field. Beckham looking long towards Rooney. Came off the header Silvestre. Rooney making his weight felt. He is big and strong. Approaching the mid-point in the first half. Makelele. Zidane. Wayne Rooney. Made his presence felt in no uncertain terms. Zidane had not met him before. He has now. Rooney has acquitted himself really well. Vieira couldn't quite catch up with him. Rooney's gone past Lizarazu too and held off Silvestre. Beckham takes it towards King. It's in! It's Frank Lampard and those three little words that mean so much! England lead France! I think you could see their centre backs were scared to come near me. They were scared that I'd go past and physically I could handle myself against them. Foul by Makelele. They can't handle him at times. You don't do that against France. He was doing something that was, for an English player, really, really special. He was just breathtaking. This was a different level. This was something out of this world. England on the front foot. Lampard can't get enough of the ball. Scholes onto Rooney. Such a natural footballer. He really has excelled tonight. The French were unbelievable. Zidane and Henry were two of the best players in the world, Thuram was one of the best defenders in the world and he was ripping them to shreds. They couldn't handle him. They could not handle him. And he was 18 years of age. Rooney never quite had that under control and then barged into Thuram. I just banged right into him, into his jaw and then I looked back at him as if to say, "Now you know," um... Still to this day seeing his face, the fear of thinking what am I gonna do to him? What a run by Wayne Rooney. It's Henry who's chasing him. Oh, he's brought down! Is he by Silvestre? He's given it! Penalty to England! Wayne Rooney fearless! Header away by Cole this time. Free kick's been given. We mustn't lose this game. Oh, here's Henry! He's been brought down by James! It must be a penalty! It has to be a penalty and David James is yellow-carded. On the day, in all fairness, they battered us. We should have lost that game easily. Even though the game didn't go well for us, I think our fans were all of a sudden excited because, you know, it was that Gazza excitement about having a player like Wayne playing for England and that was, that was really when he announced himself to the world. There was a feeling watching him in that game that he could beat a team by himself. And it's the same feeling I think that we've had subsequently perhaps with the absolute greats of the game, with people like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo. There was the same feeling about Rooney. There was and people will, you know, people maybe will deny that now but at the time there was. There was a feeling then that we have got the best player in the world here. There was a real intoxication about watching Rooney at that tournament. Gerard instead to Beckham. Gerard was taken down by Celestini. Beckham has touched the ball into the path of Michael Owen, who has space. It's Owen. Lifted in! Rooney! Wayne Rooney becomes the youngest player ever to score in the European Championship Finals. All of Europe will remember the name now! Standing between England and the last eight, Croatia. Dangerous opponents. Boy in a man's body! With the world at his feet! Sven, can you think of any young player who has made such an impact in a tournament since perhaps Pele, Pele in 1958? Can you think of any other young player... It must have been 1958, in Sweden. The World Cup. Pele. Since then I don't remember anyone 18 years old. I don't remember. You might help me but, I doubt it, I doubt it very much. Rooney mania's sweeping the square. The latest way to a fast buck, get your T-shirts and sing the songs. All together now. People make comparisons with any young players who come through and play for their country at that age. There's gonna be comparisons and that was the song which, um, Everton fans were singing. Called me the white Pele so I think that just grew on the back of that. But I couldn't care less, um, if they compare me to Pele or they compare me to Peter Crouch, for instance. I couldn't care, doesn't really bother me. It's Wednesday. We've got Portugal tomorrow. This could be the biggest game of our lives tomorrow. It's a one-off game, you know. You lose, you're out. And you can see that in people's faces. You can see it in their eyes. Even at 18, I could see players were a bit more worried. This is where the fun starts. Anything is possible from the quarter-finals onwards. Came off Costinha. It's come for Michael Owen! The time has barely ticked past two and a half minutes. It's Beckham, it's deflected. It's Rooney. It's saved by Ricardo. I knew straight away, um, something had gone. I heard a pop, I felt it. Um, felt a crack. Um, and I was thinking, "Oh, no!" And there was just no way I could've played on. Um... I was devastated. Suddenly the nation falls quiet. In those four games in Portugal, it felt like a door was opening. You know, because of Wayne Rooney, anything felt possible. And then, whoosh, it was gone. I went to a Portuguese hospital to get a X-ray. I'm in like the reception area and then there's like an old TV high up in the corner with the penalties on. I remember watching Darius Vassell walk up. Didn't fancy him at all to score. When you see that fear in someone's face... Oh, he's saved it! Ricardo... sends Portugal into the quarter-finals. And all of a sudden, it's over and I'm sat in a Portuguese hospital in my England kit. It was just like... And to make it worse it was against Portugal, so they're all jumping up in the hospital. It's recording! My nan's buried right next to Goodison. She would've loved to see me play. She would've been the proudest woman ever if she'd seen me play. There's probably more moments when I'm a bit low, I think of my nan. I still, to this day, still speak to her. It's more, more like a prayer really and... I don't know, it's just something I always feel a... I've had that protection. You know, with my nan, certainly, when I'm more vulnerable and a bit low, she's the one who, um, seems to still help me. Say cheese! No. I spent a lot of time in, in my nan's house. She was the boss of the family, me nan. Um, very strong-minded lady and, um, someone who's sadly missed... still to this day. He adored his nan. -She was great, wasn't she, your mum? -Yeah, yeah. She was only four foot eleven, wasn't she, your mum? -Yeah, something like that, yeah. -She was funny. Remember still about nine o'clock, she used to have an electric blanket so I'd go up and turn that on for her and then we'd sit up watching TV, like "Prisoner Cell Block H" or "Carry On" movies and stuff. My nan used to have a little caravan outside her house, from which she sold, drinks, crisps and... Bit like, bit Gypsy like. The whole area used to go there. It was like a little supermarket. Sold everything what you needed to cook with. She had a telly in it and everything. Used to sit in with her sometimes, didn't we? Watched all the soaps with her. Pot Noodle. But I used to then get like cans of Coke and Fanta and crisps, and take 'em to school and sell 'em in school. Make a bit of money. Got no paper, Wayne. Dad, let me have a go. Let me have a go. It's a release for me in terms of, I know that I'm speaking to her. It's like I know that things will be okay. It just helps me get through some bad moments. Bath! - Do you want a bath or a shower? - No, no. Bath, Mum. Finish it off quick and then we've gotta... Where is my Mum? In there. Okay. What's wrong? -Banged my head. -You've banged your head? Hurts! -Hurts, Dad! -It hurts, okay. It'll be better in a minute, okay? -What's the matter? -Banged his head. Bobby! There's nan and granddad. Hiya, you okay? -Yeah, nice to see you. -You, too. There's a little set-up down there. I'll show you, Dad. Watch that grass there. Don't 'cause it's slippy. I think what the press seen quite early on in my career, there was someone here who was obviously very talented at football. But also who was a bit of a loose cannon and could sell newspapers. David Beckham was coming towards the end of his time in England. So they were looking for someone new to, to put all that attention on. And obviously, me and Becks are completely different, different people, different, live different lives and... but that's what the press were trying to create with me and Coleen. It's a gilt-edged lifestyle. Wayne Rooney's home in an affluent suburb of Merseyside. But he hasn't been here for days after embarrassing revelations about his private life. I think the first time, um, we were young so there was a lot of arguing. I knew groups that Wayne was hanging round with that weren't good for him. Lovely people but together with alcohol, not good. Um, and I told him that from day one. And I didn't want him to stop being friends with them, but I just didn't want him to go out in situations with them because, um, they got themselves in, into bad situations, but I do think, um, alcohol has a lot to blame. and still has... to this, you know, from things that have happened recently. And I think it's not, it's not a good thing for, for Wayne to be unsupervised. I put myself in the wrong place, and when you're in the wrong place and there's alcohol involved, then... you're gonna make bad decisions and you're gonna have to suffer and deal with the consequences. That's what happened. It doesn't take away... any of my love for Coleen. Um... It happened. It was, a wrong decision to make. Um... I held my hands up and, um... and that's it, we worked through it. When you're making them decisions you've got to focus on what you want and not what else because you have so many people saying different things to you. Oh, you know, "Why... why is she getting back with him?" Or, you know, "Should've got rid of him ages ago." Obviously, I listened to the people who matter to me, my mum and dad and they've always given me a positive outlook on things, and there's nothing that we can't deal with. And that's my way of... You know, we're in a situation, let's sit down, let's see what we can do and can you make it work? And we have and, you know, we're not, we're not the lovey-dovey type anyway, and we like to have a laugh together, and we work well together. And we've got four kids and people... I know people say, "Oh, well, they're just staying together to keep the family unit together." That was part of it. But also we still love each other. Hopefully, you know he's learnt and he doesn't get himself into any of them horrible situations again. But it's happened and I've gotta live with it. And if I couldn't cope with living with it, I would've ended the relationship. Manchester United bid 20 million. Newcastle upped their offer to 23 and a half million. Some fans said to me today what's the point in him going to Newcastle, he can stay here and win nothing. Rooney! Rooney! Well, Wayne Rooney has been in Manchester all day today and Manchester United are finally confident that they've got their man. We're gutted, aren't we? We're sick, you know, 'cause he's actually one of us, supposed to be, isn't he? I thought he would've stayed another season at least, you know. "Once a blue always a blue" he had on his shirt. Manchester United's new signing and his girlfriend were in front of the cameras today. It's been a turbulent few weeks in the life of Wayne Rooney. He's had to put up with a torrent of abuse from Everton fans for saying he wanted to leave the club, and what's more, the misdemeanours in his private life have been made very public. Okay, gents. -Do you want some water or something? -Yeah. Please. Wayne, what has the boss said to you about how a Manchester United player has to behave on and off the pitch? I don't think he has to say anything to me. I think... as a professional footballer I should know myself and I do know myself. It's been a tough week for everybody connected with me. Obviously I made it clear that I wanted to leave Everton Football Club and once I knew that Manchester United were in, in for my signature, then there was only one place I was gonna go really. Stability looked as if it had returned to Wayne Rooney's life today. Everyone around him here wants it to stay. You start off with the press where it's, childhood sweethearts, isn't it fantastic? These two young people that lived only 200 yards away from each other and now in this relationship. And they're a success and, they're everything that we dream of. But once you fall off the pedestal that they've set for you, that changes completely. From a press point of view, they were then definitely... a front page and back page couple. Number eight, Wayne Rooney. Rooney is ready. There are no ordinary European nights at Old Trafford, but tonight is definitely a bit special. Get ready for the next episode of "Wayne's World". It was a big moment. I needed to start my career well at Man United because I'm a Scouser. It's very rare a player from Liverpool goes to play for Manchester United and wins the fans over easily so I knew I had to start well. It's not often that Manchester United or the Champions League are upstaged by anyone or anything. But Wayne Rooney's debut for the country's most famous club, it's an event. It's easy to forget this wasn't just his Manchester United debut but it was his European debut too. It was the first step that he'd taken onto the biggest stage in club football, the Champions League. This is what Wayne Rooney was born to do. It's almost like he knows that the world's watching and his reaction to that is not to cower away or... or be cautious or be at all anxious about that moment. His... His reaction, because of his belief in his ability, is to go and seize that moment. That feeling of, of the fans watching you, it's such a great feeling. When they leave I want them to go home and tell their, their kids or their, their friends how good you've just played. Wayne Rooney scores for Manchester United. And it's not the last time that you'll hear that. Wayne Rooney finds the big stage just to his liking. Rooney. He's done it again! Give him the stage and Wayne Rooney will perform. Doing what he did on his debut was just typical. When he played football I always thought that he thought of it as the most purest thing in the world, that I've gotta do everything I can on this pitch for every second, everything. It's Rooney. It's inevitable! Some things are just meant to be. Wayne Rooney has saved his first senior hat-trick for his Manchester United debut in the Champions League. He was just a kid, man. He just created big moments always. Man United debut, hat-trick, bang. Like taking a free kick, just signed at 18 years old. Giggsy or whoever, senior players, "Move over, it's my, my time," bang. He just done it, he just always... Especially at that young age. There was a fearlessness about him that you hadn't really seen. Where are you going? Klay, you playing? You're first. Five. One, two, three, four... -Oh! -Right, well, you go up the ladder. Look, you're going up the ladder. -One, two, three, four, five. -I'm winning, Mum, aren't I? -Go on, your go. -Dad, look at me. Oh, no, he was there. - He wasn't. He was over there. - He was. He went up that ladder. He went up that ladder then he come round. -He did. -Okay, yeah, he did. No, leave him there. - Nah! - One, two, three, four... -Oh, close! -No, you're there. Yeah, 'cause you've gotta go round here like this. Yeah, but that... He weren't in front of me. One, two, three, four, five, six. I'm winning. Ha-ha! You've gone down the snake. It's just a game. Kit! Kit! - Kit! - You're disqualified. I won. I won so you's have all go to bed. -I won. -Okay, goodnight. -So you have to go to bed. -No! Yeah, 'cause I won, I decide that you can go to bed. No! Kit. - You lost. - No! Stop it now. I won. - Don't let them win then? - Sorry? -Don't let the kids win then? -No. Well, did you see there? Like the way he's shouting, crying like that. It's a bit... I was probably the same. Good afternoon! Welcome to the heavyweight contest for the Barclays Premier League Championship. We were almost champions. We needed not to lose that game. So I believe that for a rival club to be a witness of a rival to be champion, that hurts. Wayne Rooney, he's got new boots to christen today. The very same boots that he'll be taking to the World Cup finals with England. I remember the game and I changed my studs. Put longer studs in 'cause I wanted to hurt someone. Just anyone? Or anyone in particular? Yeah, um, Chelsea, if... I think if they got a point, they won the league. At that time I couldn't take it. So "premeditated" is the word? I changed my studs, yeah. They... The studs were legal. They were the legal size but they were bigger than what I'd normally wear. Yeah. Here we are. John Terry got one off Rooney. I remember there was a 50/50 with John Terry and I've gone right over the ball. John Terry does not stay down unless John Terry's got something wrong with him. On the top of his foot he had a... a big hole. He was on crutches after the game. Probably some people will say, "Wow!"... "That's not a... a very nice thing to do, to feel or to say." But for people like me, for football people like me, we look at it on a different perspective. He's just a young guy that is upset that he's frustrated. That doesn't accept to lose, a title on a second time, which for me means a lot in relation to the character. Blame myself for that injury. I think if you look at it back... my front studs have got caught in the ground and me foot's bent forward, which I done the three metatarsals, broke three of them. So, yeah, I blame myself. Well, you can see the agony on his face right away. It says that guy that could shoot us to the World Cup and be our most influential player. Is he gonna be there? One's thoughts are with Wayne Rooney. He wants to win always. I don't think he, thought a bit about the World Cup before he goes out on Stamford Bridge, rightly. He wants to win that game. - And were you at that game? - I was at that game. So what was going through your head when that...? Shit! Hey, Rooney! There's real concern this evening for the World Cup fitness of England striker Wayne Rooney. He'll be out for six weeks. Coleen, Coleen, how's Wayne? I remember thinking, it's my first World Cup, how can I not try and be there? Gonna do everything I can and I did. I done... I was in oxygen chambers. Wayne! Wayne! I was back and forwards seeing specialists. Sir Alex, he didn't want Rooney to go. He told me, very, very straight. "Don't take him. That's it, Sven, I'm going to kill you." Verbally. And I said, "Alex, go on holiday. I'm going to take Rooney and we're going to the World Cup, sorry." And that was it. The metatarsals just became a theme of tournaments from the point that Beckham broke his in 2002 and, of course, Wayne was gonna do his in 2006 'cause he was Beckham's sort of successor as the team's mega star. On the road to the training ground, a welcome sign that said it all. As the team warmed up for the first time on German soil, every lens and sports journalists' eye was trained on one foot and the player attached to it. Man United and England agreed to get an independent specialist in. And whatever he decides, um, they go with. He took me out onto the pitch, had a look at me moving. His last test was, um, he just stamped on me foot. Said, um, "Does that hurt?" I said, "No." He said, "You're fit." Yes, Wazza! Hey, hey! Well done, son. Big man's back in town, son. Fingers crossed. If it's a small chance that Rooney might be ready, even if it's for one game, and you don't pick him, Sven, they would have killed me before the World Cup, for sure. He hasn't trained for five, six weeks. You know, I think we all get a little bit carried away in this country. The lad's had a broken foot and, you know, just let, just leave him be. Let him, let him rehabilitate. My first training session with the team was the next day. We went out onto the pitch, jogging round. There's a ball by the halfway line. I've kicked it trying to hit the crossbar. Pulled my groin. Had a six centimetre tear in my groin... ...which, um, I didn't report to the physios. I didn't know that. What do you think people will think hearing that, fans? I don't know and I think it's... naïve, of course, but you wanna play. You... You wanna play for your country and I was thinking... I'll be okay. Expectations were now sky high. England were gonna win the World Cup. You know, this was the golden generation. This was the best team anyone had seen. You knew that the players all had book deals. The... the wives and girlfriends, of course, were starting to become famous. Baden-Baden was this small, sleepy German town. Very well-heeled, very orderly. Um, there was only really one bar that the, the... the wives and girlfriends and parents actually went to. It wasn't crazy but it appeared crazy, and a lot of photographers just came from nowhere. Back then, getting the photograph, getting the shot, which had to be done with a conventional camera, was a really, really big thing. There was nights where we did go out and, you know, we had a good time, and we were... no one done anything wrong. The players weren't out with us, um... We never dragged them out of the hotel to come out with us. Out of all the tournaments I'd say that was the most memorable one that we felt like a big England family. An elite sports team should have no distraction. It's a World Cup. We had distractions like you would not believe. To be honest with you, when I look back on that 2006 tournament and I think about how it was handled, the build up to it, that was obviously the WAGS and the families travelling. Wayne's injury, coming late, the big man's here and all that sort of crap. It was just a nonsense. It was probably the height of suspicion between the press and the, um, and the England team. So that was an era where you didn't really get near to the players. There wasn't particular closeness back then between us and them. Why? I think you're looking at the baggage of past tournaments, past failures. 1998, David Beckham, um, gets sent off against Argentina and gets destroyed, not just by the press but gets destroyed by... you know, the British public and comes home with people burning effigies of him and so on. And that was I think a big shock, a big dividing line between players and the media maybe. And I guess the press were more powerful then as well. I was never right for that tournament physically. I was getting painkillers non stop. By his own ridiculously high standards, Wayne Rooney's just looking a bit weary to me. He's lasted what, nearly 69 minutes. He's punched the, coaches' dug out. I mean, it's just him. "I wanna play football." It's almost like Rooney's been called in for his tea there, isn't it? Come on, son! He was deployed by Sven as the kind of all-purpose saviour of the team, if you like, up front. A team that was not functioning very well, so was starting to launch long balls in his direction. And he was getting a lot of criticism because after all this wait for him to play, he wasn't quite able to deliver. For England now, the heat is truly on. Knock-out football in baking temperatures, this is intense. Oh, he's lost it to Rooney. And Rooney could punish him here. Rooney's not happy with his goalkeeper there. He wanted a better kick than that. Rooney, chance to worry the centre half. The system is not working for me. Rooney's frustrated. Rooney needed to be angry. He needed to hate his opponent. He needed rage. That guy was nuts. He was a mad man. You could say something to him, he'd just flip. "Aaaagh!" He was always playing on the edge. He was only ever a little trigger away from snapping. Over the top for Rooney, trying to squeeze between centre halves! Aggression, ferocious, tenacious, not violence. Yeah, of course, he threw the odd punch. But to me that was, to be fair, where someone deserved it. I never saw him throw a punch where no one deserved it. David Beckham! Yes! Oh, that's brilliant! It's brilliant from Rooney. Well, I think England fans everywhere will be delighted by the fact that he's looking much sharper now, isn't he? First half, he was frustrated. Second half, England have got him in much more and his work rate's picked up as well. It was not brilliant but it was very stable. We were, a good team. Rooney! Rooney! Rooney! Rooney! Before the Portugal game I thought, now we're going to, to win it. We're going to beat Portugal and go to the semi-final. To play in a tournament like a World Cup you've gotta be at your absolute peak. And he needed football. He needed games. He needed sharpness, he needed the bank of minutes under his belt. And he didn't have them. And then it just becomes that he was just frustrated. Couldn't handle frustration. Stakes are high, World Cup quarter-final. Down the years, the last eight matches in World Cups for England have been pretty dramatic affairs. And here is Wayne Rooney with an early chance. Blocked by Meira. Rooney. That's nicely done! Beckham! Here's Rooney's lay-off to Lampard! Cleared away by Miguel. It's a lovely lay-off by Rooney. Why hasn't he gone for goal? The snap shot was up. This is England's brightest moment so far. Now Rooney. Every time he has the ball there are possibilities. England are playing so badly but he's playing well. He's fighting lone battles. He's... he's trying to chase down every ball and fighting with these really good, quite tough Portuguese defenders. Then the street footballer comes out. The outstanding young talent in English football, one moment of madness, sent off in a crucial World Cup tie. I still don't know how the referee hasn't given me a foul beforehand. And I still don't know to this day, truthfully, if I've meant to stamp on him or not. I don't know, I couldn't tell you. Me head had completely just blurred out. I don't know if I've meant to do it. I don't know if I've just come down on him accidentally. As the game went on, I was on my own. I smashed a few things up in the dressing room when I went in. And England are on the brink of elimination again. I remember sat there watching it. It was probably the most loneliest place I've been. I remember sat there thinking, "If we go through... I miss the semi-final, potentially miss the final. If we go out it's my fault." Ronaldo for Portugal. It's another excruciating World Cup exit for England. Once again quarter-final and bust. Are you saying it wasn't a red card? No, I don't say this. I never, I never say this. And why the... Wayne is my friend and I say... I say sorry. I think you, much more than me, for the next years need Wayne Rooney. So pay attention, please. He is the golden boy of English football. Don't kill him. I beg you because you will need him. How much of that tackle do you think was just sheer anger at the pressure? I don't know. I think it was just a spur of the moment thing, when he's just... just lost it for a second. Did you have that switch? Yeah, more than likely, yeah. Been in some dark places. You look at yourself, you look at consequences. I think that's why I like to be alone and to get yourself through it, because whatever happens from them times, it's you, it's only you who can, can turn it around and if you can't get through moments of heartache, moments of disappointment, then you may as well stop 'cause you're gonna have them. It's Manchester reunited, with Rooney and Ronaldo on the pitch together. I remember speaking to Ronaldo and saying to him, there's gonna be a lot of media coverage on what's happened. I've got no issue with what you've done. Let's get ready to go and win the Premier League. What did he say to that? Yeah, I think he was relieved. I think because... Yeah, I've... Other players might have an issue. I had no issues with him. My focus was on Manchester United. A new season starts then for Manchester United, one in which they can't really afford to let the grass grow. They've got to make up ground on Chelsea. This is Rooney looking for Ronaldo! Certainly friends again now! Rooney provider, Ronaldo the finisher! Four up inside 19 minutes. Manchester United are blowing Fulham away. I think out there we let our football do the talking today and thought Cristiano was brilliant and scored a great goal. O'Shea... Not really away by Carsley. It's fallen to Rooney. He can win it here. He might have won it for Manchester United. I wanted success, I wanted to lift trophies. It still is my whole thing in playing football. It has been one of the great finishes in the Barclays Premier League. They've done it in style. There's no better feeling when you win a trophy with your teammates. It's the best feeling you can have in football. The evolution of Wayne Rooney was... he evolved there as a player. I saw the passion at the beginning, I saw the aggressiveness in the right way. I saw the desire there, "I want to kill." To, okay, now, that's not enough to succeed in the game. Just look at this run from Wayne Rooney. That is tremendous. They just couldn't stop him. I have seen Wayne Rooney playing on the right because he had to for the team, playing on the left, he had to for the team. And he was going to do it, no matter what. For me that's a sign of a guy that understands what's important to, to win. Don't like losing at all. Remember before the Champions League final. I'm not thinking, "Oh, it'd be great if we win this." I'm thinking, "How bad is this gonna feel if we lose?" Oh, he's missed it! He's missed it! So it's more that fear of losing driving me on, more than the thought of winning. Rooney, right foot, has buried it! Manchester United are Champions of the World. Wayne Rooney delivered it for them. You win this, you have done something special. You won it three times in a row and you are special. Rooney. And it's Nani on the gallop again. He's got Park with him. In for Rooney! Hundred Premier League goals for Wayne Rooney. The PFA Players' Player of the Year for 2010, Wayne Rooney. Is it a big responsibility that you feel, carrying the nation's hopes? Um, no, I don't think of it that way. I think, um, we've got a lot of work, us players in the team. Um, a great manager and, um, you know, if... if I get injured then so be it. We've got other players there to do the job but... I think we've prepared well for the finals and, you know, hopefully, we'll be able to bring the trophy back home. Chipped in, Rooney's in there! Just taken off his head by Halliche. 2009-10 had been one of his best years and then he had an injury in the Champions League against Schalke. History repeated itself. He came to the tournament undercooked and the memories of 2006 meant there was this little narrative starting to build about, he was a good player that didn't do it in tournaments. Now he finds Rooney. He just seems to be struggling to come to terms with controlling the ball and giving it to the right place. It was one of the worst games I've ever seen in my life. Wayne struggled because again it was a tournament he went in where he wasn't properly fit. The booing even drowned out the sound of the vuvuzelas. England's fans felt badly let down by their players. Wayne Rooney felt let down by the fans. Nice to see your home fans boo you! That's loyal supporters. Those loyal supporters had had to endure one of Rooney's worst ever games in an England shirt. There's no doubt at all it's a night that Wayne Rooney and the rest of his teammates will be very keen to forget. A night when the England players failed to deliver. One of the things about Euro 2004, I've always thought about Rooney is that his impact in that tournament was so stellar that in some ways it made the rest of his career a prisoner to that tournament. Because our expectations were so high after that tournament, he'd made such an impact. He'd torn apart some of the best defences in the world. Our expectations were so high that almost everything else was bound to be a disappointment. Boarding a plane to fly out of the country, but for Wayne Rooney getting away from his troubles will be harder. Over the weekend, a tabloid newspaper alleged the England and Manchester United star paid an escort girl for sex. That's great, isn't it? Lamp. -Where's that going? -That's in the main lounge. They were the two big chairs that was gonna go either side of the, the bar but I've just said leave them ones for now. Do you ever think, the pair of you, that it's amazing, that you're where you are together today? Yeah, I do I think, um... we're lucky that we've both, you know, had the strength and support of each other and people around us, and to, to, to keep going and... and trying, and that's something that we have had to work at. Have you forgiven him? I wouldn't be standing here if I hadn't forgiven him. When these, these things have happened I've... um, we've sat down and I've explained what's happened, um, and it's not nice. It's not a nice thing to, to have to do or to do. It won't happen again, I don't want it to happen again and... um, for us to, to get through it, it was tough. Had tough, tough days, tough weeks, tough months. But I feel, um, we've been through hard times and it does make you stronger as well. Life goes on and I've... accepted... Well, not accepted... I've... moved on. - You've moved on and it's... - You've accepted it? No, I, I wouldn't... Not the behaviour, no. It's not acceptable. If forgiveness is... Like, I'd say it was different. I wouldn't... It's not acceptable what he's done but... it's... it's happened and that was what... that was, you know, the stage of life that we were in at the time. And, um... But we've moved on. I forgive him. But, yeah, but what... It wasn't acceptable. Um... But, no, it's not, it's not something that, you know... If it come up, we'd talk about it like we're talking about it now. It's not... I haven't got the anger that I did at the time. Okay, Sir Alex will now make a statement. David Gill phoned, he says, "I'm on my way over." He says, "I've got some bad news for you. That his agent intimated he wouldn't be signing a contract and he wanted away." I mean, it was a shock. Well, I couldn't believe it. I just was dumbfounded. I could not understand it at all because only months before he was saying it was the greatest club in the world. He wanted to stay for life and... I mean, I just don't know what's changed the boy's mind. And we've done nothing but help him since he's come to this club. That's another mystery for us. I don't know how many times we've helped him in terms of his private life and other matters. We still have the door open. - And who knows? - Alex... Okay. There's no questions. We sold Tevez then we sold Ronaldo, so I was the one player left with a high profile. So I went into Alex Ferguson's office and I said to him, "What's the plan here at the minute? We've brought two young English players in who are unproven." And then I remember Alex Ferguson's response was, "Get out of my office." Wayne Rooney has just confirmed that he does want to leave Manchester United. The club's star striker released a statement a short time ago. The one big disappointment I had with Wayne was when he announced publicly, just as we were walking into the changing room, his teammates were playing a game. Don't do that to us. Take your shit somewhere else. It's on Sky Sports News. Beamed into us, "Wayne Rooney..." It literally hit us like a tonne of bricks because this wasn't him. This is not him. You know, he couldn't do that. He would never damage his teammates. He was a team player. That was the only time that I've ever thought he let himself down. They were offering me a contract of £200,000 a week. So it would've been quite easy for me to say five years, £200,000 a week, let me sign it now. Would've been quite easy for me to do that. But I wanted success on the pitch. That means more to me. Here is Wayne Rooney on the front page of, the Manchester Evening News in the light blue of Manchester City and they are among the front runners now to sign United's talismanic striker. He's a good lad. He plays football well. He gives his all for the team. He wins games. He scores goals. And, yeah, he's a human being, he makes some mistakes like we all do. I don't care. But don't do that to your teammates. And I was surprised that he survived that. I really was. I thought that was it, he's done. I think it damaged him with the fans a little bit at the time. I do. Because obviously the idea was he was going to City. I think one of his problems was that he took on Fergie. You can't do it and I think that sort of turned fans against him. But all the things Wayne said about how they needed to do better with transfers and invest in the team were actually what United fans are still talking about now. Actually, if you look five years down the line from that meeting, Alex Ferguson knew where the club was going and he got out of there as quick as he could. And they're still picking up the pieces now. As I sit here now, I think that takes real guts that and courage to do what he did, 'cause none of us would've done it. Not in a million years. Gone into the manager and said, "Who you signing? You'd better sign some good players, else I'm off." We'd have been turfed out that door quicker than we'd actually finished our sentence because you just wouldn't do that. But you look at the likes of, you know, Robson and Cantona, and Roy Keane and Rooney. These were the personalities and characters that could do it, because they basically were that great a player. And they had that little bit of an edge to them, that they would go and do those types of things and that's what makes them stand out. Just days after saying he was intent on leaving Manchester United, Wayne Rooney has stunned fans by announcing he's staying after all. Old friends. This is the image released this afternoon symbolising harmony between Manchester United's manager and star player. He apologised to me this morning and the players. And I think he'll do that with the fans, which is important because we've all been hurt by the events of the last couple of days. From now on, whatever he says, I think it will take improved performances on the pitch to convince many fans that Rooney is truly committed to this club, Fiona. I think if he looked back with hindsight, he'd be mature enough and honest enough to say, "I went around it probably the wrong way" if he was honest about it. But at the end of the day, did he get what he wanted? If he got the contract he wanted then he might sit there and go, "It's exactly what I needed to do." 150 up for Manchester United for Wayne Rooney. He just needs another 100 to beat Sir Bobby Charlton. I thought I'll make the fans like me again. I'll get them singing my name again. Here goes Rooney! I'd do anything for that club to win. I'd cheat for them to win. Nani. Rooney! Oh, wonderful! What a goal! And what a time, in what a place! What a player! Have we all been lucky enough to witness something very special? Well, I haven't seen anything like it anyway, that's for sure. All the talk will be with that winning goal. It was unbelievable. We won league title after league title after league title. We got to three Champions League finals in four years. Kicked it towards Giggs, who's onside, and Wayne Rooney! Oh, yes! The best moment yet in the mercurial career of Wayne Rooney. In terms of what we achieved, it probably is the most successful four or five years in Premier League history. Manchester United are champions yet again. But it gets lost because Man United in 1999 won the treble. Rooney. Just brushes off Tompkins and goes for the spectacular! Wayne Rooney, extraordinary! I was lucky enough to have played with him for England. He is, without doubt, one of the best players that this country has ever had and his records speak for itself. Rooney is, for sure, one of the best players England ever created. Best striker. It's Rooney. Oh, my word! History! Sir Bobby Charlton's record is gone. And one man stands alone for Manchester United. Nah, listen, the kid was a genius, man. It's mad what he was doing. He was an unbelievable player. Don't get the credit he deserves. Is he too common? Does he look too much like a normal geezer on the street maybe? I dunno. He don't look like a super star, does he? We live in a kind of age of individualism. And we can see that in Messi and in Ronaldo. That was never the case with Rooney. He ended up doing the work for others. There's some race the other way and look who's running hard after it defensively, Wayne Rooney... A big collision by the captain. That is unbelievable effort. Fair enough, he wants to do more. Cross-field ball! Goal! He would fight for everything to try and win the match. He was the ultimate team player. Ultimate team player. The biggest danger for Wayne is his focus, the minute he stops playing football. He's got the sort of the Gascoigne in him. It's like addiction. It's addiction in a good way. He's addicted to football. He's addicted to adrenaline. He's addicted to buzz. Wayne Rooney says he wouldn't have changed a thing after bringing to an end his 19-year playing career. The former England captain has been named permanent manager of Derby County. It's a new beginning. I've closed one chapter in my life. There's a lot for me to improve on, a lot for me to learn, and try and, you know, give the best version of me and then, in the long term, to obviously try and get this club back into the Premier League. He's gonna need time. It's not easy. How do you deal with the press, how do you deal with the pressure? How do you deal with having the pressure of a team on your shoulder, a nation on your shoulder? And Wayne can tick all those boxes. He went for it. He did it and he came out of it. Obviously bruised but he came out of it and now obviously he needs to put that, I dunno how he's gonna do it, in a nice way, to be able to be a good manager. I know that he knows, football. He reads football. He leads. When he decides to go to the Championship and be a manager and start his career from there, it's because he loves it. Football is and will be part of my life till the day I die, whether I like it or not. Rooney! Rooney! Rooney! Rooney! Rooney! Rooney!
