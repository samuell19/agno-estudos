BEAR YE ONE ANOTHER'S BURDENS This film tells the extraordinary story of the encounter of two young men. It's too insignificant for a history book yet it's closely interwoven with the events of those traumatic years. The painful acceptance of guilt. The lack of bare essentials. In a destroyed country. All this didn't extinguish the will to live. First a few hundred, then thousands took their fate into their own hands. They cleared the rubble to make roads, endured the shortage of food and water, although they barely had the strength. The newly founded state was only a few months old. And mere words couldn't convince the overwhelming majority of skeptics. Factories had to be built. And houses constructed. And they had to protect themselves against hatred and malice. Are you looking for the sanatorium? Yes, Hohenfels. Is it far? I'm Head Nurse Walburga. How do you do? - Heiliger, Josef. - Pardon? Josef Heiliger. I took you for a border guard. Why are you in uniform? Why not? That's your business. Luggage is usually picked up at the station. Didn't you read your admission notice? Of course I did. Here, young man. My goodness. But I can't allow that. Head Nurse... Do you want to play the hero? You'll have to break a few habits here. Don't think that being severely ill necessarily means being in pain. But we can't possibly do without you. It's unthinkable. If I were still 60 or 70, I wouldn't be worried, Doctor. As long as it belongs to the Burgbaums I make Hohenfels staff decisions. - If you say so. - You have a say too. - Me? - Aren't you in the union? Well, if you put it that way, Doctor... It's no joking matter, young man. Do you see this here? Honeycomb lung. Cavities the size of cherries and some as big as crab apples. - Did you try artificial pneumothorax? - Ambulatory. Severe adhesion, fever, exudate. According to Dr. Zimmer cauterization is contraindicated. But surely there are empirical values. How long does it take to get over it? I'm needed, Doctor. First and foremost this young man needs to get some rest. He needs to lie down and rest, sleep and walk slowly. Please show him how to do that, Head Nurse. In Hohenfels the clocks tick slower than in the mountains. But they're waiting for me there. I need to be there. I don't have a day to lose. In times like these, not even an hour. I can't sit here and twiddle my thumbs. I'd rather... Die? You have to find inner peace. Just think, it's not your concern. No matter what happens. It's not your concern. Hohenfels is a sanatorium, not a hospital. The chief physician attaches great importance to the observation of house rules and etiquette. Since treatment tends to take longer... How long roughly will I have to stay? We count in months here, Mr. Heiliger. We strive for a civilized environment. Study our regulations. Dr. Stülpmann introduced them 17 years ago. - Was this a sanatorium before the war? - Since 1929. I wouldn't have guessed. It looks like an expropriated castle. It's still under private ownership. The owner lives in the American zone. She's a distant relative of Mrs. Grottenbast, your future tablemate. - My what? - Your tablemate. Like I said, etiquette is very important here. Your room is on the second floor. Take your temperature in the mornings and evenings. You'll fill in your medical record yourself. Please carry this bottle at all times. What for? For your sputum. You're contagious. But be discreet, please. Pardon? It is used discreetly. Mr. Heiliger. I never need to spit. Or is that compulsory here? Mr. Heiliger! I... I wanted to carry it myself. Of course. The books, the beer... We have nothing against books here. - I want you in bed when I get back. - Before dinner? Three days bed rest. That's customary here. Three days? Is that really necessary? Don't worry, we'll make sure you don't get bored, Mr. Heiliger. Please give me your arm. Pull up your sleeve. Don't get out of bed. Will someone be joining me? Of course. What's he like? I'm sure you'll get along fine. Koschenz. Hubertus Koschenz. Hubertus? I don't believe it. His name is really Hubertus? Whoever comes here only wants to get well. That's all that matters. You won't eat in the morning. You're getting the tube. Please sit up. Mr. Heiliger, please assist us. Don't be afraid. Open your mouth. Stick your tongue out. - Stick it right out. - Take a nice deep breath. Okay, and swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Don't retch. Swallow. Swallow... I'm Jochen. If there's anything you need, I can get it for you. Anything except women and weapons. - Even a bottle of beer? - Anything. It'll cost you, though. Danger money. Two. Okay. Bottles or cases? Think about it. It's cheaper if you buy in bulk. Just think, it's not your concern. No matter what happens. It's not your concern. Just think, it's not your concern. No matter what happens. It's not your concern. It's not your concern. No matter what happens. It's not your concern. Just think, it's not your concern. No matter what happens. It's not your concern. Just think... I want to get out of here! Let me out of here! Hey, you! Hey! Wake up. Is there anything I can do for you? I'm Hubertus. Hubertus Koschenz. Your... What do you call it? Your tag? - Heiliger. - Pardon? That's my name. - Seriously? - Josef Heiliger. I didn't ask to be called "Saint". Call me Jupp. I prefer that anyway. All right then, Jupp. You see... I wouldn't want to call my son Hubertus either. You can't be serious. He's our savior. Bullshit. Take it down. You have your... boss. I have mine. Didn't you know I'm a minister? A preacher. He's a pastor. No. This isn't going to work. We're going to kill each other. They have to separate us. Don't you even want to give it a try? The man admitted with me must be around 70. So you think he'll be... Yes, one of us two would get stuck with the old man. So what do you say? Shall we declare a ceasefire? Jupp... Let's get one thing straight. Soviet authorities picked up my dad in 1946 and he never returned. My mother lives on a pension of 90 marks. My bride was but a child on her flight from Katowice to Merseburg. Her hair turned white from all the things she suffered. So... You can't rally me to your cause. And I won't even bother trying to convert you. Could we agree on that? - Lenin. - Sorry? Before we can unite we must draw definite lines of demarcation. Lenin. Are you starting already? Ceasefire. Wonderful. There's your deck chair. And now I'll show you how to tuck yourself in. One blanket underneath and one on top. Make sure you always keep your feet warm. Keep your arms under the covers. And don't turn on your side. Two holes and no pneumothorax. You're in a bad way, comrade. Get an iron lung or a bagpipe. Or the moths keep eating away. Munch, munch, munch. They'll make a sieve of your lungs. Next a pulmonary hemorrhage, a blood gusher and that's that. Get thoracoplasty. Sacrifice some ribs. The rot collapses. - You're on disability, easy street. - Enough, Jochen. Sonja. Bishops can't jump over pawns. Fear is what kills us. You should know that. A bagpipe. A cripple at 20. Bayerischer Rundfunk, RIAS Berlin, Radio Bremen, Süddeutscher Rundfunk and Südwestfunk. We're transmitting the plenary session of the Bundestag. Cabinet members and party leaders will debate the delicate German question and the international situation. Bundestag President Hermann Ehlers will chair the session. We're switching to Bonn. The session will begin with a foreign policy statement by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. Mr. Heiliger, this is a rest cure. I thought you exercised discipline. President of the Bundestag... Always keep your shoulders covered. Did you hear me, Sonja? By the way, Jochen, we owe you a thank you. We'll be having beer soup tonight. I assume the case under your bed was earmarked for the kitchen. For beer soup? Yes, of course. That was very kind of you. May God repay you. God? It was his supply. Are you ready, ladies? Your tablemates are waiting. Mrs. Grottenbast, Mr. Heiliger, your tablemate. It's... my pleasure. - To friendship, Mrs. Grottenbass. - Bast... Grottenbast. As you wish. Miss Sonja Kubanek. Mr. Hubertus Koschenz. Let's just swap. Something is wrong with my lungs, not my head. Nostra salus agitur. - Bless this meal. - Bless this meal. What did he say? He referred to our prosperity and adversity. Cicero. Albert, my school sweetheart, was also an officer. He was an aviator. We were just about to get engaged. I find that uniforms accentuate a man's masculinity. HEAVE HO OR GO! Dear... colleagues. I have an announcement. All comrades will meet Saturday after the quiet hour. In the reading room. For an important meeting. That's all. What is he supposed to do if he has his orders? I didn't always speak from the heart when I was an officer. But don't worry. It won't last. Otherwise I might have to move my small concern to the west. Small, Mr. Trufelknecht? A factory with 100 employees? And I would like to cordially invite you all to my Bible study. On Saturday at 5 p.m. in the reading room. You don't need over an hour? Thank you for your attention. Any more announcements? No? That's comforting. Wasting our free time on Saturday! All is held in His strong hand. Nature bows to His command. Rise, socialists, close your ranks. The drumbeat calls, the banner waves. We'll free all labor from the banks And give back freedom to the slaves. All earthly joy, the solar light, The spirit's fire and wisdom's might Thanks to God the cunning foe Cannot take my soul in tow. Holiest war. - That is the workers' holiest war. - Saves me from the evil power, Devilish guile, dark treachery. Keeps me every day and hour. Guides me straight to His abode. Arise, you damned, to overthrowing. Starvation's prisoners break loose. The right like a volcano glowing - Erupts exploiters to reduce. - A mighty fortress is our God. A sure defense and armor. Your nullity endure no longer. Find identity, unite! Academics! I think it's funny. Want the milk to curdle? - The Lord of Sabaoth. - No God, no king nor noble lord. - There is no other God. - Us from our misery to free - The field is his forever. Our only sword is our horde. - Were the world with devils filled - Empty phrase - "rights of the poor." - Intending to devour us - Empty phrase - "noblesse oblige." Be quiet! That's enough! Mr. Heiliger, Mr. Koschenz. Report to the chief physician. You obviously haven't understood where you are and why you're here. We're done. What you have in your chests isn't funny, it's deadly. The grim reaper in the spring of your lives. If you don't muster patience, maturity and a considerable amount of luck. I expect you to be mature and tactful towards each other. And tolerant. But not in the same room. I also think it would be for the best. We're worlds apart. Antagonistic opposition. Separate us. Please, Doctor. You can't avoid each other out there in the real world. You're going to have to get along. And if you can't, then your socialism, Mr. Heiliger, is just as useless as your Christianity, Mr. Koschenz. We live on one planet. And if two intelligent men with different world views can't for the sake of their health and their lives live in the same room and behave like civilized human beings, there isn't much hope for humanity. Come in. The file. Miss Sonja, Doctor. You'll stay in the same room. Get out of here. Communist propaganda should not be trusted. The flood of assurances has failed to convince us that Bolshevism will not take a more subtle approach to spreading throughout the whole of Germany. Must we put up with this? Trufelknecht! We should learn from Soviet politics in and around Germany since 1945. Could you help me? Grotewohl's policies must be seen as deceptions and subterfuges. If we want to maintain our freedom and our standard of living we have to stay immune to all communist propaganda. Politics is not this facility's forte. We must oppose their attempts to intimidate. We have to get out the vote. Our votes count just as much here as anywhere else. We must mount effective self-defense against communist sedition. Let's not give communism a chance. Last night the gravedigger came to get the redhead from 25. A hemorrhage. Must be an awful feeling. Feeling the warm blood in your throat. If you wouldn't mind... I'll flatten him one day. You heard Federal Inner-German Minister Kaiser on "Berlin Speaks to the Zone". Hello. Quiet hour. - I'm looking for... - In a moment. I'm looking for my son. Gentlemen... May I invite you for a drink in my room? I'd be delighted if you came. - Of course. - Gladly. Excuse me. Mother. How did you manage that? Don't, Mother. You've lost weight. You don't eat enough or don't you get enough here? You can't beat homemade. Everyone says gaining weight is the most important thing. - That was a great idea. - Wasn't it? A two-star official brought it by. A police inspector? They need someone who can type and you have the time to practice. He said they have a lot on their plate and sends his regards. Like it? It's fantastic. Clarified butter? Goose fat? Rabbit. I traded Father's work boots for it. It's from Grandpa Renner. Grandpa Renner? Everyone says it helps cure tuberculosis. Even the doctor said that dog fat is good for lung... The dog? You mean Benno? Delicious, Jupp. Delicious. With onions. My favorite. Fantastic. - You can have them both. - Are you serious? I don't care for it. Honestly. You're a real friend, Jupp. A real friend. It's really good. Who would have thought? Dog fat. Dog fat! I wanted to treat Mrs. Grottenbast. - She noticed immediately. - So what? That's malicious! Everyone says it helps. Don't you want it anymore? No! Well, then Jochen gets it. Shall we sell it to him? We'll trade it. For butter and beer. - How much is it? - It's premium quality. But it's not cheap. Trufelknecht is also interested. I just got some myself. Here? For how much? For free, Mr. Jochen. Mrs. Grottenbast gave it to me. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Mr. Heiliger. I'd just like something to read. Let's talk straight. That's the German way. Gentlemen, this is the castle on the other side. Days aren't days in the normal sense here. We're in the blind spot of time, if you like. Whoever comes here comes here to die or to recover. No more than that. Forget your party meetings and Bible study. We need silence to recover. And reflection. Cheers. The word of God doesn't disturb the silence. Cheers. But the word of RIAS does. This isn't about God, it's about Bible study. We don't appreciate meetings here. Meetings of any kind. Is that what Dr. Stülpmann says? Well, certainly not to you. Because he's afraid. Hohenfels means a lot to him. So? You're a police officer, Jupp. And our chief physician was a Nazi. A party member since 1936. But you weren't, right? - What? - A Nazi. - You're not afraid? - Come on, Jupp... What? He's an officer. They like to say it straight. No, Commissar. I'm not afraid of anyone. I was never a Nazi. I manufacture socks. For ladies and gents. That not only feeds my family but also 129 men and women. I have the support of all 129. Including the works council. That's an anachronism. But it's not enough to make a difference. Good evening. He's going to cause us a lot of trouble. Why "us"? Because we're allies, Mr. Koschenz. - Have been for thousands of years. - I don't understand. Church and capitalism. We don't just share the same initial. We share the entire alphabet. Reverend. You should know more about the Augsburg Confession. 1530. The Diet of Augsburg. Philipp Melanchthon. The separation of church and state was the proposition of Article 28. I interpret it as a blessing that we're returning to that tenet. You want to let them have the power? What kind of a clergyman are you? A theologian who takes the scriptures seriously. And a church that takes its sacred mission seriously is a servant and not a sovereign. And the church won't condemn those who try to promote social equality. It will see them as an instrument of God. Whether they be godless or pious. Good evening. Take it easy, Jupp. Don't get excited. Above all you need a clear argument. - It's time to stir things up. - How many do you think we are? I bet some of them have hidden their membership books. Possibly four or five. Fellow patients... Mr. Trufelknecht. We're holding a party meeting here now. Comrades, I would ask you... This reading room is open to everyone, Mr. Heiliger. Socialist Unity members may enjoy special privileges outside. But we're not having that sort of thing here. Does anyone think differently? Does the same apply to Bible study? Exactly, Mr. Heiliger. No one would object to party meetings if the rules were the same as for Bible study. Open to everyone. I bet he'd like that. Which of you are party members? Raise your hands, comrades. The weather is better outside. I suggest we go for a walk. It's too nice outside to go back in. Sonja, our tea! May I? This... This is... It's beautiful, isn't it? This isn't just a stroll, Sonja. Our meeting... We couldn't stay in the reading room. I'm sorry. I see. I'm sorry. Are you alone? How can I help you, Sonja? Please. It's the birth of a new world. A country where no one goes hungry. Where everyone has a roof over their head. A peaceful country full of diligent people. We can make this dream come true. I for one want to be a part of it. But we're in a tuberculosis sanatorium. Here our manifesto is a pulse of 68, a temperature under 98 and clean sputum. Okay, we may be sick. But we're not corpses yet. Not yet. No yet. Well put. We're here to recover. We want to get out as soon as possible. To help build this new world. We can turn this country into a garden if we want. First of all we need bread, enough for everyone. That alone would make it worth the effort. Yes. - Ample bread for everyone for free. - For free? In that case they'll feed it to the chickens. - People are selfish. - Let's get through winter first. But not as if we were mummies. Changing the world changes people. In 10 or 20 years the word selfish will no longer be in the dictionary. - I'm hot. - Do you have a fever, Sonja? Let's head back. It's time for Bible study. It doesn't look good, Mr. Heiliger. Not at all. I have to tell you. The damn beasts just won't stop. Another pneumothorax? There's nothing more I can do for you. I'm afraid you only have three more possibilities. Surgery? Yes. One option is thoracoplasty. We would remove the ribs covering the diseased lung. The diseased lung collapses and stops functioning. What happens after that? It's irreversible. You'll probably remain disabled. You could pursue a light job in an office perhaps. - What's the other possibility? - Resection. The diseased lobe is surgically removed. However, this type of surgery is still new. The risk is still very high. But I would be fit for work? No, you wouldn't. There is only one way you will ever be fit for work. And even under the most favorable conditions the chances of success are slim. I'm talking about a new medication. American. Very expensive. Can you get it? Maybe the head of the Nazi Persecutee Sanatorium. Couldn't you speak to him? One physician to another. No. I wouldn't be a very good advocate. On the contrary. Lindner. He was in a concentration camp. And I was in the NSDAP. A Nazi. He knows that. I didn't want to believe it. And you can't understand it, can you? Hohenfels was something of a lifelong vocation for me. And if it means being able to stay chief physician here, I'm ready to join any political party. Even yours. Mr. Heiliger. Here! Look out! Carry on. FOR PEACE AND PROSPERITY VOTE THE NATIONAL FRONT SLATE That's precisely what we won't do. But, Doctor, it can't go on like this. Flags, billboards, banners! A bulletin board in the stairwell. Where's this going to lead? To a new X-ray machine for planigraphy, for example. Here's the approval. But still... All this going on in our clinic. - I can't take it. - Head Nurse... Just think, it's not your concern. No matter what happens. It's not your concern. COMMUNIST PARTY MANIFESTO You're interested in this? I thought it would be different. A bit more passionate, maybe. Not so dry. No, Sonja. You have to read it right. Not just with your eyes. Explain it to me, Jupp. For example: Communism doesn't keep people from appropriating labor's fruits. It keeps them from exploiting others by virtue of nationalization. Or this: Don't wrangle with us by judging our abolition of bourgeois property with your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, etc. Your thinking mirrors your bourgeois status. Your jurisprudence is the strong arm of your class. Silence! This is quiet hour. From Nurse Inka. It's hard to come by glasses. And you communists always seem to have something to say. Right? Nurse Inka said that it's also for Mr. Koschenz. Fellow patients. Allow me to say a few words. You all know and appreciate our comr... fellow patient Mr. Sibius. Not only is he the oldest patient, he has also been here the longest. 17 months to this day exactly. We thought long and hard about what we could all do to show our kind, helpful, fatherly friend our appreciation. We suggest that starting tomorrow, Mr. Sibius occupies the bed next to the radio. Then he can choose, at his own discretion, which radio station we tune in to. I smell a rat. It's because of RIAS. But Mr. Sibius isn't privately insured. Well, I should think, if we all agree... Doctor? But... MALDIVES That's... That's too much! A main prerequisite of the revolution is the dictatorship of the proletariat. The first phase of communism, therefore, cannot yet provide justice and equality. Cannot yet provide... If a man be overtaken in fault, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness. Bear ye one another's burdens. Right. You're enjoying East German Radio, Studio Leipzig, on AM, FM and shortwave. I see it before me, Sonja. No more ruins. New buildings everywhere. All apartments have bathrooms. Bockwurst stands galore. Fried chicken on every corner. The dawn of communism. And what happens to the crooks and loafers? There won't be any. Only an exploitative society can breed those. People like Jochen will always be with us. If you don't work, you don't eat. That's how it will be. In 10 or 20 years everyone gets as much as they need. We'll live to see it. I'm... sure of it. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. I was just thinking. Well? Were they married? I mean Marx, Engels, Lenin. Did they know how to be affectionate, how to kiss? What makes you ask that? You're not a real person if you don't know what love is. Was Lenin a good lover? He was the best. At kissing and also as a lover. Well, that's a relief. Good luck. Hurry up. I'm crossing my fingers for you. He could have called me. Before he sent you over here. Yes, it's true. We have the medication. Four treatments in the next six months. A total of four. And here they are. Stülpmann is right, of course. You need it just as much as the other four patients. From a medical point of view anyway. You're young. You have a right to live. So no one could hold it against you. I don't understand. Tell me who I should take it away from. And I'll do it. I'm dead serious. Comrade Heiliger. Listen to this. Bruno A., age 62. Inmate in Brandenburg-Görden in 1933. Then detained in Sachsenhausen. Elected mayor in 1945. Land reform commissioner. Infection of both lungs. Nora N., age 17. Sole survivor of a family murdered in Auschwitz and Dachau. Hidden for four years by a farmer in Upper Bavaria. Or Uli J. Emigrated in 1934 after a six-month sentence. International Brigade in Spain from 1936 to 1938. Wounded four times. Jupp. Jupp? What happened? Talk to me. They won't give it to you. Please wait. Don't walk so fast. Just leave me alone. I don't need anyone. No one. I've been asked to hold the New Year's sermon. In Waldeck. It's a beautiful church. They've already given me my robe. It's not quite my size but that's not important. The church is almost 400 years old. 500 souls. For me that's the greatest Christmas joy. But you might not understand that. Tomorrow... Tomorrow I'll start on my sermon. Will you need your typewriter? Jupp? Did something happen? Say something. Is there anything I can do? You can use it. Is it because of Sonja? Having problems at home? I want to read what you write with it. Sure thing, Jupp. I promise, but... Please leave me alone. Jupp. Jupp. They won't give it to you. Come here! Come here! Come to me! Come here! Hubertus. Jupp, I have company. My fiancé. Could you go for a walk or to the reading room? Oh, I get it. But I'll need my coat. - Good evening, Miss. - Good evening. This is Jupp. And this is... my future bride. UNSATISFACTORY! SATISFACTORY! Going for a walk? - It's chilly outside. - Oh well. We've been waiting for you, Mr. Heiliger. Come and sit down. Thank you, Jupp. Help yourself. It's homemade. To my red brother. Being holier than thou, I'll drink to that. I can feel that in my knees! Although it's not exactly scientific, I have to say it's cozy. Fortes fortuna adiuvat. Fortune favors the brave. Here. 10 pills after every meal. Morning, noon, night. Here. That's... - That's... - One medication isn't enough. How can I ever thank you, Doctor? By closely following the rules of this house. Avoid excitement. Rest. Eat, walk slowly. - And first and foremost... - Just think: It's not my concern. Very good. I have the medication. Can you forgive me? I'm sorry. I behaved like an idiot. We all do sometimes. I wasn't angry with you, Jupp. Hear about the New Year's party? Really. It's true. With real wine. And music. Stülpmann's allowing dancing. For everyone with a temperature under 98. I haven't danced for two years. Maybe I've forgotten how. And you? Are you happy? Hey! Am I happy? I could tear him to shreds! That's counterrevolutionary! Here. Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat or drink. Nor what ye shall put on. While thousands live in basements! We have to face all the disillusioned who say, "Kiss my ass" all the time. Who want to have more to eat before they work. Take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. What? Just because God feeds the fowls of the air? Who will clear the rubble? Who's going to fix the machines? Where does the bread come from? Not from your savior, by God! Rather from Max Krause and Franz Mäller, who worked for it. Jupp, you've got it all wrong. Oh no. It's exactly what certain people here want to hear. Let us include in our prayers all those who, sacrificing their freedom, turn against the false prophet and remain steadfast against the heresy. Does that mean pray for those in prison? Yes. For all prisoners around the world. But you aren't reaching the world. You're preaching here. And shouldn't people be imprisoned if they are rollback saboteurs? Anything new agitates and incites you! You're fomenting hatred against us. You know very well that not only saboteurs are jailed. I'm defending... We're defending ourselves, that's all. Perhaps you don't know your Lenin well enough. He writes: "Every religious idea, every idea of God, even flirting with the idea of God, is unutterable vileness. Religion is a contagion of the most abominable kind". Wouldn't you call that hatred? It's no secret. We're against religion. - We propagate atheism. - Exactly. Zero tolerance. Hostility and war against dissenters. Half of Lenin doesn't make the whole truth. The state should not be concerned with religion. But everyone should be free to profess any religion they please. Or not to believe in any religion. Did you read that too? "Civil or judicial discrimination on religious grounds is prohibited." That's precisely where we're finding that reality is anti-Leninist. Yes. Because what you say is full of ambiguities... And allusions. In a situation like ours this type of sermon is as destructive as brimstone. And I let him use my typewriter! Not anymore. Enough! You've already had three. Would you excuse me a moment? Fantastic. It's bock beer. 4.50. Including danger money. I think you better attend to your tablemate. Where's our... good shepherd? He's not usually a hermit. You shouldn't talk like that. I still believe that hard work earns respect. - That's what my Albert always said. - He's working? Yes. He's preparing tomorrow's sermon. He said to tell you that he won't be long. He'll be back before midnight. That's men for you. If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men. Romans XII, verse 18. My sermon. Go on, dictate it. "Dear friends. In full faith and in gratitude for the goodness of our Heavenly Father we stand on the threshold of the new year." I'll take you back to your room. They're never there when they should be. Just like Albert. They're all fools. May this new year be a year of peace for us all and the rest of the world as well. A year of reconstruction, of charity and prosperity. May the year 1951 bring you all convalescence and recovery and may your unfulfilled wishes come true. Allow me to raise my glass. To the new year. "And all people will henceforth live in a liberated relationship. We will approach our brothers, our neighbors, our fellow men with deep reverence and thoughtfulness. The core of the message of the Apostle Paul is the request that all of us finally recognize the dignity of man and treat everyone accordingly. But where there is distress there is no place for dignity. Therefore our responsibility towards our faith imposes upon us the imperative to become involved." "...become involved." And now you should add: "...in the National Front, in its committees." No, Jupp. This is a sermon. Not a speech for a party meeting. We all have to get involved where we see fit. So... "God has given us a mission in the community where we live. A community we experience every day. Our families, our congregation, our circle of friends. And in the political system." Doctor! Come quick! A hemorrhage! "Until the end of the world and for all eternity. Amen." Amen. They won't have heard that before. I don't think. Well don't make a habit of it. I'm pooped. Sunday mornings it always becomes clear to me. Atheism is better for your health. I'm sorry. Antagonistic. That's what that is. But... That's... Why did you leave? Sonja had so been looking forward to New Year's Eve. As if she'd known it would be her last. May God bless you and keep you. May God shine his countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. May God raise his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen. Why, why, why? Death offers no consolation. Only God the Almighty. The Almighty. Who created Earth along with the plague, tuberculosis and cancer. Yes, Jupp. God's ways are unfathomable. We have one consolation. - Nothing happens against His will. - Yes. Of course. That's a real consolation. Nothing happens against His will. The concentration camps, the gassing of Jews. The torture, the mutilation, the incinerations... The countless injustices in this world. Nothing happens against His will. Exploitation, oppression, racial hatred. If he really existed, this God of yours, there would be millions who would tear him to pieces. Lord, forgive him. It's the pain inside you that's speaking. I understand you, Jupp. God isn't just almighty. His ways are unfathomable. "For now we see through a glass, darkly. But then face to face..." Let me tell you something, Hubertus. It's a blessing for this world that God is nothing but a myth. There is no God. That's the only logical explanation for all this absurdity. Or you simply don't think about it. About the world. About life. I... I'd like to ask you a favor, Nurse Walburga. You've lost weight. Couldn't you talk the chief physician into separating us? 600 grams. You should be ashamed, Mr. Heiliger. Because of 600 grams? You're on the road to recovery. In two or three months, God willing, you'll be able to leave this place a nearly healthy man. And instead of being grateful you insult the man who sent God to you. You mean the chief physician? It requires a great deal of charity to sacrifice that kind of medication. Possibly at the cost of one's own life. For a nonbeliever at that. What? What do you mean, sacrifice? I can't believe that you didn't hear about it. The medication? Is from Hubertus? From Switzerland. A Protestant relief organization. Why, Hubertus? Why? Because it's different for me than it is for you. But... To die? Death is the same for everyone. No, Jupp. To die without hope, without faith... Your last hour on Earth must be hell. And you? Aren't you afraid? My fate is in the hands of God. He can save me if that's His will. Or He can call me home if He deems it is time. His will be done, Jupp. Death is only the gate. Behind it there is light. Don't torture yourself. You can have the pills. I'm feeling much better. Thank you, Hubertus. Thank you. It should be possible to manufacture these pills here. I mean, for everyone. Just wait till the factories are running again. We have to fight disease just as we fight injustice. That's not against your faith. God gave us reason and emotion so that we can't stand to see others suffering. - You're a good man, Hubertus. - Oh really? Look after yourself, young man. You were a peacetime casualty. You'll have to take your uniform off. Purple hearts are out of style. Thank God! - Sorry if I caused you much trouble. - Oh, come now. - I fear we might even miss you. - Who's going to ring the glass now? Keep it down. Hubertus? I've memorized a good line written by your Lenin. "The principal quality of a revolutionary, is patience." He must have known you. I also know a good line. But it's not from Lenin. Romans XIV, verse 19. "Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace." That was verbatim. For you, Hubertus. Believe me. God always achieves His ends. Always. That's a rumor. You mean us. Us two. Dedicated to my teacher Emil Fuchs Copyright (c) 2006 TITELBILD, Berlin Subtitles: Sabine Dörfler et al.
