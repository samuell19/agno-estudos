Then you, uh, talk about whatever bullshit comes to mind, like, uh, pollution. Need a light? I don't smoke. Can I have it back? I wish I was. Not a smoker.

[clears throat] I'm trying to get to North Carolina. But I lost all my money here, so-- Where'd you lose it? Well, actually, it was stolen... by this fucking chick. [laughs] That's... You got jacked?

You hungry? You want some-- some breakfast? My mom makes the best waffles. First...takes a layer of batter. Puts it in the grill. Right? Takes a layer of peanut butter. Puts that on top. Another layer of batter. Closes it up. And when it comes out, it's all crispy on the outside, but it's, like, gooey and peanut-buttery on the inside. It's totally awesome. I think she invented it. How old are you? How old do you think I am? I'd guess, uh, 17. 19, tops. No, man. Look. This says you're 31. Oh, shit. Yeah. It's all fucked up. Well, I'm old enough to vote. [chuckles] You want some of this? No. Breakfast's my favorite meal. My mom used to make a... big breakfast for me every Saturday morning. Where do you live? Uh, Ft. Irwin. Before that, Ft. Benning. Before that, Ft. Knox. Ft. Knox had the best women. I live in Henderson. You want to see my home? Is it cool? Oh, it's beautiful. [chuckles] All paid for. Thanks, but, you know... I can't. I really can't. And thanks for breakfast, too. But I gotta go find a job today. It sucks, yeah. What-- What do you do? Whatever pays. Y-You don't say? Well, I have some work that needs to be done on my home. Perhaps we could go there right now and take a look. I don't know. Um...I really got to, uh... make some money, fast, you know, 'cause I gotta get to Charlotte, North Carolina. By this weekend. I'm gonna be a race car driver. So-- [laughs] Is this something you've done before? Sorta. And...you need money to get to the race track. I-- I follow you. Well, I could pay you well for your labor. Really. Mmm. Well, I mean... as long as you're paying me. You know? As long as I'm working for it. I don't want no handouts. Mmm, check. You know, you wouldn't believe the people that I've met since I've been here. Bunch of losers. [chuckles] Normally, I don't trust anybody... over 25. And I can tell you're at least 30. But, uh... [chuckles] uh, you seem cool. You know, you seem all right. I appreciate that, Johnny. And I appreciate your honesty. And believe me, I know what you've been thinking this entire time. But you're wrong. There are factors involved here. Hygiene, for one. There's also the matter of politics-- sex-- sexual politics, which I don't care to be a part of. So what I'm trying to say is that every person has a special thing about them that makes them who they are. Do you follow me? Yeah. For instance, you...are honest. And that one thing makes you who you are. I tip well. That's my one thing. But we're also alike in that we both have special interests that other people don't have. Uh, you want to race cars, Johnny. And me? Well, I'm...I'm into something else. I'll... [squeak] help you do your thing if you help me do my thing. Sound like a plan? Stop the car. Now, there's no need to jump to conclusions. Stop the fucking car! All I want-- [tires screeching] Uh, my stuff! Stop! Stop! Hell, you pervert! Fuck! Perverts and liars and there's nothing fucking left! You wouldn't believe what that guy wanted me to do. It was so disgusting! I can't even-- I can't even believe it. He-- He wanted me to-- [sigh] He wanted me... Sit and bark like a bitch? God! Don't even say it! Uhh! Yeah, that's Russel. Big-time king. What, you know that guy? Yeah. How much was he gonna pay you? Look, I didn't ask! Hell, whatever it was, it wasn't enough! He was-- I-- I knew I shouldn't've trusted him. I knew it. He was-- It-- He was 40. At least 40. God! So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. I don't know. I'm total-- I'm fucked. [sigh] You wanna hang out tonight? Why? What do you fucking want from me? Nothing. Just-- Just thought you want-- might want to hang out or something. [sigh] That's all. [soft chatter] [girl laughing] [girl laughs] [Boy] Shut up! It's not funny. I'm in love. All right, it's obvious the Pez Boy has mad feelings for this woman. Damn right. Wait. Is this the one from that party? Yeah, the last desert party. Her name's Tracy, and she's totally the bomb in every way. She's a raver, like me. Her favorite fruit is gummy peaches, like me. And we both think happy hardcore's the ultimate. But she's older. I think she wants to hang out, but I can never tell 'cause she's always fronting, dude. How old is she? She's 18 and a total hottie. I've seen her. I'd say she's a nottie. Shut up, Eric! [coughing] Johnny. How you living? [laughter] [girl laughs] [coughing] [laughter] [coughs] [laughs] Uh... doing all right. [laughs] No, man. You gotta say something cool. Like what? Like "Living large." Chillin' like a villain. [chuckling] See, Johnny, you got two things to pick from. "Living large" and "Chillin' like a villain." So, Johnny... how you living? Uh... Living like a villain. [laughter] Hey. [laughter stops] Evening, losers. Oh, shit. it's only the president. Get fucked in the ass tonight, Eric? Yeah, by your dad. Bitch came twice. [laughter] Ladies. You don't mind, do you? No. So, what are you boys up to tonight? Nothing illegal, I hope. [Scoob] Oh, no. Scoob, you got a sec? Naturally. Hey, yo, yo, yo. [Girl] Okay. Check it. Try and say "toy boat" ten times really fast. Toy boat, toy boat. Toy boat, toy boat. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Toy boat, toy boat, Toy boat. [Girl] You see, dude? I want some, Steve. The hell with that. Toy boat. Toy boat. [laughs] No way. Haven't you guys got some homework to do? [Eric] So, uh, Steven. Why aren't you kicking it at that rich trick's place you keep bragging about? Because I had other business to attend to tonight. The streets are changing, man. Those fucking Metro cops are everywhere. Someone's putting pressure on those motherfuckers to jack the shit out of us. I don't know who, but the shit's getting serious. I need a change of scenery. I'm thinking about heading back to La La Land. What's stopping you? Some of us are making too many duckies to bail at the present time. But this bullshit with the local law enforcement is seriously cutting down on my disposable income. What are you so worried about? You're gonna be famous, right? Working it as we speak. Steve's gonna buy a big house in the desert so he can party every fucking day. [laughs] Parties by the pool, baby. Right. Did I ever tell you about that time that rich trick dragged me out to that crazy-ass pool party? [laughs] Get this. Bitch didn't even want to fuck me. Just wanted to hang out. Picture me, sitting around, buncha queens sipping strawberry daiquiris, piña coladas. It was beautiful. Scored a $200 tip that night. Wow. Tell him we need beer. Oh. We need beer. Somebody hook us up? I'll go. Go to a place behind the Flamingo parking structure. The Korean guy's down. Need a fake I.D. [laughs] All right. Hey, I'm-a-- I'm-a go, too. Cold weather's bad for your kidneys. Know that? No. I'm gonna die if I don't get a six soon. I'm gonna die if I don't eat something soon. Hey, who-- who's that cute chick sitting by Scooby? Which one? The real cute one. Oh, that's-- that's Kelley. She's a hottie. I want to throw a beat so bad. Uhh! [laughs] Hey, what was up with that one guy, too? Steven? The dickhead? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Did he really do all that shit-- Whassup, fools? Whassup, J.T.? Not a damn thing. Who's this? Whassup? Oh, this is-- This is Johnny from last night. He's down. You better be. Jason Torres. Hey, yo. J.T. With cash money. Got that? Yeah, all right. You got that? What's up, men? You guys hungry? Thirsty? Hey, I thought I told you not to come in here anymore. Go grab some of them bags over there, man. Whatever you want. It's on me. Get outta here! I'm calling the cops! I'm calling right now! Hey! Now, I've told you before! You get the fuck outta here! Oh, fuck you, man! I'm thirsty. No, fuck you! Fuck you! I'm calling the cops! I'm calling the cops right now! Hey, yo, man, O.E. cool? Get your punk-ass friends outta here! You two! Get outta here! Right now, God damn it! I'm calling the goddamn cops. I'm calling 'em right now! Get the fuck outta here! Where the hell you think you're going? Whoo! Sorry! I can't resist jackin' Chang! [laughing] Hey, I don't know if you can crash here tonight, but you're totally welcome to stay at my place if you want. Cool. Thanks. [keys jingling] Eric. Hi. Hi. Hi. It's not a good night tonight. Larry's gonna be off. Can we just-- just hang out? Uh... Yeah. Come on. H-- I'm Johnny. Hi. Hi. Yeah, that's-- that's Johnny. [telephone rings] Oh. Uh... make yourselves at home. [Ring] Hey, Johnny, come here. Let me show you something. Hello? Oh. Larry. Hi. That's my mom. Wow. That's cool. Where's she at? Oh, shit! I forgot to buy smokes. In the kitchen. In the kitchen. Listen. I love you. Look, I do! I do. Uh, Larry, please. Come back. You're a new face around here. How come you're not in school? Dropped out. School sucks. Where you from? Ft. Irwin. Before that, Ft. Ben, and before that, Ft. Knox. Ft. Knox had the hottest women. My dad's a colonel, so... It was kinda like being in the army, so... I got sick of taking shit. I left. What kinda shit? Telling you what to do all the time. Telling you how messed up you are. Shit like that. You know? So you decided it was time to leave for good? That's right. [cups clunking] Got any brothers or sisters? I got a sister. She's younger. She's one of the reasons why I want to be a race car driver. I want to be able to take care of her. She's deaf. Gonna be a race car driver? Yep. Stock cars. That's why I want to go to Charlotte. That's where all the best people are. I'm gonna work for, uh, Richard Petty's team. He's the best. So you figured you'd just come into town, make some quick money, and be on your way. Kind of. At least you can do whatever you want here. That's cool. Is it? [snickers] Definitely. My dad didn't give a shit about me. Now I can do what I want. So I'm making money, and I'm going to Charlotte. And that's it. How're you gonna do that? Make money? Do whatever I gotta do. Do what Steven does. Yeah, he doesn't even know what Steven does. So what? I'm tired of being taken advantage of. I'm not dumb. I can make money. Just like anybody else. I'm gonna. Johnny, you have no idea what you're talking about. You sound like my fucking parents. I just don't want you to get jacked, idiot. I know what I'm doing! I stole some jimmies from that store and everything. [snickers] If somebody wants me to do something that I don't want to do, I'll just leave. That's it. No big deal. I want to tell you a story, Johnny. Right after I had to stop dancing, I went through some really bad times. This was before my boyfriend pulled me out of all that shit and saved my life. But I thought the way that you do now. I thought I'd make some easy money, get a lot of attention. It was like that for a while, too. Anyway, this one night, I was picked up by this guy in this brand-new Ford Explorer. It was a really nice car. You know? He was in his late 30s, and he said that he was in town for a couple of days for some big computer software convention and he wanted to have a good time. So I asked him what he was into, and he said that he was into killing people. [chuckles] I didn't pay attention to what he said 'cause I knew the guy was drunk. He had a bunch of vials in the backseat, and... Anyway, uh, you know... I figured he was just trying to scare me. I...heard that kind of thing before. Some people get off on that kind of thing-- fear. Makes 'em horny. So I asked the guy, um, where we were gonna go. And he said that it was a surprise, and I said I really didn't like surprises, and that I'd feel a lot better if he just pulled over. But he didn't. So I, uh... I knew he was heading up the strip towards the freeway, and I had to do something pretty quick, so I told the guy that I was a junkie and if I didn't get a fix real soon, that I was gonna throw up all over his brand-new beautiful car. And that did it. So he pulls into this little place behind the gas station. [teapot whistles] So anyway, I tell the guy that I'm feeling a little better but that I still need to fix up. And he says okay, but that he would like to see what I look like down there. So he tells me to lean back and relax, which I did. And he tells me to close my eyes, which I did. I don't even really remember what happened that clearly, but I was just-- I was kicking him and punching him and hitting him. And then I pushed the door open on the car, and then I started running down the street. I don't even remember when I stopped, but when I did stop, I looked down, and I noticed that my jacket was torn. And I look inside, and there was blood everywhere. I'd been stabbed in the chest, and I didn't even know it. I guess there was so much adrenaline pumping through my veins that it took the pain away. They told me that the knife had hit a rib and that if it had just been a little higher, it would've cut my heart. I figured the guy missed 'cause he was drunk. You never told me that story, Veronica. I haven't told you a lot of stories. Anyway. It's late. I'm gonna hit the sack. Nice to meet you, Johnny. Nice to meet you. Good night, boys. Good night. [door opens] [door closes] The Apollo 11 spacecraft thrusts into space. The total payload is equivalent to 4,000 pounds, and it's-- [changes channel] ♪♪ [music] [changes channel] [sigh] What the hell? What? What, are you gay or something? Well, I-- I wouldn't-- I wouldn't say that. I knew it. Fuck. I knew it! You-- [sigh] You want to get busy with me. That's why you helped me. God, I'm so dumb! No, it's not like that at all. I-- I-- I just-- I just thought-- [sigh] I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm leaving. Everybody here wants to take advantage of me and have sex with me, so fuck everybody! I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna make money however I can. I'm getting to Charlotte, and that's-- [sigh] I can't believe you lied to me. I didn't! You never asked me if I liked girls! [TV audio] [approaching footsteps] [Man on TV] A roasted pig on a 'cue. [man throws keys down] [opens door] [door closes] That's...Larry. Veronica's boyfriend. He's a-- He's Metro cop. Actually, after he busted her for prostitution, they started going out. So it's...it's all really secret. [TV dialog] You're the weirdest people I've ever met in my whole life. Johnny!

You looked so sad a minute ago. [laughs] I was. But, um... But I'm okay now. [giggles] [giggles] [laughs] [laughs] [laughs] [both laughing] Oh...[laughs] I was viral. I'm-- I'm Wilma Garrett Price. I'm-- I'm really sorry for the display earlier. Wilma. Like The Flintstones. Yeah. [both laugh] Johnny. It's nice to meet you. Wait. Wait a second. What time do liquor stores close around here? It's about 4 in the morning, right? Uh...I-- 'Cause I plan to drink about a thousand wine coolers, so I-- I'd better run. It was nice talking to you. Yeah. Bye. [chuckles] Do you drink wine coolers? When Pete's unit got back two days ago, he had already made up his mind without even talking to me that right now was the time to officially tie the knot. I mean, I wanted to a year ago, but... wasn't the right time for him, so... when he said, "Let's do it," I mean, what was I supposed to say? "Let's wait another year"? Hell, no. I mean, he had three days' leave. Can you imagine that? Three days, and he's right back out again. I mean, I didn't have time to prepare one little bit! When we got to the chapel this morning, there was all these couples lined up. [knocks bottle over] So embarrassing. See, I always thought that... when I finally married the man that I love... that it would be something really special. Not like this. Not Las Vegas. I mean, our families weren't even invited. 'Course, his buddies were here. And to top it off, they-- they insisted on having the bachelor party and our honeymoon on the same night. Of course, the-- the party on the lake was much more important than spending the night with his bride. I mean, who cares if we already live together? He didn't even ask me how I felt. And the funny thing is that I... I could live without a fancy wedding. I really could. I just wanted us to be alone tonight. If you ever get sick of him... you come to North Carolina and live with me. You're such an angel. You really are. Thank you. I'm so glad we met, Wilma. Ever since I got here, it's just been the worst time of my life. I got all my stuff stolen. All the people I've met, every one of them, has been crazy in some way. See? See? This is what I'm talking about. He's been earning hazardous duty pay for months, and what does he do when he has time to spend it? Just leaves it right here on the dresser. [sigh] I don't want to talk about him no more. Sure. When's he getting back? He's supposed to have the boat in by sundown tomorrow. So we have plenty of time. Do you want to... take yours off now? [kiss] [sigh] I'm all yours. What do you want me to do? Well, whatever you prefer. I-- I trust you. Just go slow in the beginning, okay? Okay. Um... I'm sorry. Uh... It's been, like... I just don't want to mess anything up. [chuckles] Well, why don't you start by taking the rest of your clothes off? Sure. Can I just turn the light out? If you want. [bang, thud] Hey, honey. Let's...fuck. Um... Pete, uh, no. No. No. No, no. No, Pete. Pete. Wait. Pete. Pete, no. Wait. Wait, Pete. It's your ass, honey! Hi. No! No! Hi. [Pete roars] Oh, my God! Come here, you bastard! Pete, no! No! Pete! Unhh! [choking] Pete! [gagging] Oh, shit! Pete, stop it! Stop it, Pete! Pete, be nice to him! Pete, no! No! Let him go! You're fucked, kid. Airborne qualified, bud. Pete, stop it! Force recon! Eat some dirt! Pete! Pete! No! [shards clattering] [hinges creaking] [door closes] Is breakfast ready, Mom? [birds chirping] [sigh] Nothing that terrible could be real. Huh. What are you doing here? I...I live here. This is my place. You, uh...don't remember nothing? Total blackout, huh? Well, you want to see something funny? Look. [sigh] That's not funny. I've seen worse. Where's my shirt? I tossed it. You tossed my shirt? Oh, you should've seen it. All covered with barf bits and blood samples and shit. Really gross. The smell of vinegar tutti-frutti, too. Uhh! Before I woke up, I was dreaming that I was at home... and my mom made me breakfast. It was so realistic. You want breakfast? I got this cereal here. I, uh...picked it up because it has a race car driver on the front. Ricky Rudd. He's good. You don't have to eat now if you don't want to. I could try. Here you go. [packaging rattles] Uh, that's what you put your bowl on... like a platform. Oh. Here you go. I got you a spoon here. Oh, don't worry. It's clean. I jacked it from MacDougal's last night. [sigh] And I wasn't sure what kind of milk you wanted, so I...I got you lowfat. It's-- You know, it's usually a safe bet. But I can't drink milk 'cause I got that lactose disease and I might die. Eric. I just want to say... um... I'm sorry for what I said. All right? I really appreciate you helping me out and everything. Ahh, it's no problem. I mean, I don't really think you're weird or whatever. [chuckles] I mean, you never know. I mean, I could try knocking on you right here. [chuckles] [chuckling] Yeah, I forgot about that. You know, I don't really remember... anything. It's bizarre. Like...how did I get here... and stuff? What happened, exactly? Oh, You mean after you got beat down? Yeah. Melanie and Kelley found you. And they got me, and we brought you back here... like, two days ago. Two days? [sigh] How long have you lived here? Uh...uh, two months, I think. I get bored being in the same place. Like to move around a lot. You go camping? [sigh] No. Actually, I like to have extra chow. Just in case. Like, if I had an accident... I couldn't work anymore... I like to know I won't starve. Or for holidays. Definitely for holidays. Plus...Plus, I like soup. I mean, soup's a bomb. Very healthy. Yeah, very healthy. I mean, with crackers, of course. You gotta have the crackers with tomato soup. Oh, my God, it's the best. I mean, I don't even need to be sick to eat that crap. Is there, like, a place around here with real cheap rent that I could stay at while I'm working? What do you mean? You can kick it here. No, I can't st-- I can't stay. You have one-- one bed. No. No, it's no-- it's no problem. I'll just sleep on the floor. On the floor? No way! This is your-- This is your place. Really. I don't mind. I'll just-- just spread out my clothes, and I'll sleep on top of them. Actually, it's a lot more comfortable than the mattress. Really. You should kick it here. [distant siren] All right, I'll stay. But as soo-- as soon as I make some money, I'm gonna pay you back. All right? Yeah. All right. [traffic roars by] All right. This is a major cruise area, right here. Kinda sucks for me 'cause guy tricks are totally opposite. Inexperienced and youth is what they're looking for mostly. Sometimes I think they're like vampires searching for the Fountain of Youth. It's draining. It's fucking draining. I mean, I feel so old sometimes. But you know, I gotta keep looking young and inexperienced for the tricks, which won't last forever. Maybe you should switch to girls. Yeah, right. Hmhh. You're really just not attracted to girls at all, huh? Not even just a little bit? Not even for money? Nope. Man. I don't get it, man. I don't get it. Well, like I said, this is a major fucking cruise area, so-- Yeah. All right. You gotta keep that in mind. All right. I really looked horrible? Fuck, yeah.

Since you're Mister Big Time on the strip these days, I thought you could give young Johnny here some tips on how to score the straight women. Well, you've come to the right place. Cops are stupid, Johnny. Keep that in mind. When a woman picks you up, first thing, start by checking the rearview mirror. There'll always be at least one cop watching if it's any kind of sting at all. Ask her to make a couple turns. They hate that shit. And also say shit, like, "What are you doing out here on the street? How long have you been out here?" You know, acting all concerned. Then they'll grab your dick, and you know what I do when they do that? I look at 'em right in the eyes and I say, "Suck it, baby." [chuckles] So either they do, or they pull the fuck over real quick.

That's what those fucking cops are waiting to hear, and that's when they jack your ass. They don't bring it up, they know they're playing you, and you don't have time for that shit. You see... most women are beautiful, sensitive, little flowers who have been forced into paying for sex by their small-dicked, pussy-ass little husbands. By breaking the law, they're getting back at that asshole. Or...she could be a horny bitch. [chuckles] So, uh...you completely straight or what? 'Course. Yeah. Aren't you? Well... personally... I dig women. But...when it comes to work, it's simply a matter of cash flow. You see, Steven's bisexual. "Bi" him something, and he'll have sex. [laughs] I'm a businessman, Johnny.

But one day, my teacher called my mom in for a conference and told her that I was confused because I kept walking into the girls' bathroom. And my mom, she, um, she was totally embarrassed and didn't let me hang with any other kids in the neighborhood for a long time. You know. She-- She was just really scared. Anyways, my mom left me when I was 10. And I went to live with some other people. And it only got worse. When was the first time you boned a chick? None of your business. Come on.

I'd-- Like I said, I've done stuff with girls before. I mean, that should-- that should... cancel out the fact that I've never completely... [laughs] Well, you're still a virgin. Shut up! Maybe.

All departing passengers should proceed to Gate 10 immediately. [turnstile turns] I know! I know. This is the gate change announcement for Gray Line bus number 23 to Salt Lake City. Bus 23 will now depart from Gate 11. Gate 11. Bus number 48 now ready for boarding at Gate number 7. All passengers proceed to Gate 7... [muttering] [slot machine clicking] [chuckles] Hmm. [baby cries] Excuse me. [bus pulls away] Hmm. [coins falling] I need a destination, sir. You can't leave without a destination. [bus door closing] [Announcer] And they're heading down the final stretch! And it's Yellowtail by a length, followed by Mickey Finn! Mickey Finn is making his move on the outside! Go, go! Go! Come on, come on! And it's Yellowtail by a nose! Damn! No! Would you boys like another drink? I'll have another beer, darling. Me, too. Be right with you. Well, hi, everybody, and welcome back to the Charlotte Motor Speedway and more racing action. The weather's perfect. It's a beautiful day. And, Chuck, I got to tell you, the Petty Team's been putting on the pressure all day today. Well, you're not kidding about that, Bob. You know, coming off at 11th place finishing in Talladega last week, they hunkered down and grabbed the number 2 spot at qualifying. After ending only 5/8 of a second behind the leaders, they've dominated today's race. Harley Hebert is not a happy camper and knows he's got to make it up on his next pit stop. And, with less than ten laps to go, that should happen real soon. The 43 car has just pulled into the pit, and pro chief Jerry Powell looking worried. Oh, you bet he is, partner. With 3/8 of a second to gain, this has got to be picture perfect. Harley Hebert's crew chief has just signaled his driver into the pit, and w-- Wait-- Wait a second. Looks like we got a tire rolling into pit row. That's exactly what it is, and one of the crew is running over to deal with it right now. I wish I could see the expression on Jerry Powell's face. That boy earned his six-pack for the day. That was a seriously close call. Didn't hurt their time much. Well, Hebert's team did lose a little time at the pit... Great job, Johnny!
