Put that light down. Sorry, ma. Taxi. Taxi. Albert Square. This is my cab. - Give us a chance, lady. Me and the boys are late for a New Year party. Sorry. I am late too. I got this cab first and I happen to be fire-watching. Ah, be you age, Just because you got a tin hat you are not everybody. They aren't coming over tonight. - You think not? Just because it is a holiday? Be your age. I don't want fire watch any more than you do. But I promised someone I'd take their place and I will. Now. Get out of my cab. - Okay, you win. St Andrews Church, Harcourt Square. Good evening. - Evening. Didn't expect you tonight, sir. I am substituting for Mr Allenby. You don't mind if I go first, do you? - Oh no. Good luck, ducky. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Uh. Mr Graves is supposed to be fire-watching with you tonight sir. I've got a date. You don't know if he is coming or where he is? No idea. That is a bit thick, you know. Do you always wear a hat in church? Sorry if I am late. Oh, it is the American lady. I thought it was Mr Graves's night. I am taking over for him. Uh. You two people know each other? We have fire-watched together once I believe. Possibly. Well, I'll be popping along. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. And a Happy New Year to you too, sir. Uh. Now I remember when we stood watch before. Oh yes? Exactly a year ago tonight. At twelve, I said 'Happy New Year'. And you said .. 'Uh'. Uh. Better begin with the roof. Begin what? - The inspection of our post. Nonsensical red tape. I know this post. Any volunteer on reporting is required to make a complete tour of inspection. Checking all equipment. Stirrup pumps, sand. Do you expect me to walk around a roof I know as well as the inside of my pocket? I expect you to do the job you have undertaken. Come along. It is one thing to do you duty and another thing to be rude about it. I consider the correct way to walk around this roof .. Is to keep one hand on the rope all the time. Half a minute. I'll go this way. You go that. - Last year you dropped your torch. I never dropped my torch. If you insist on wearing it on your belt. Kindly see you have got it fastened properly. I do not relish being treated as an incompetent. I happen to run a munitions factory with fifteen hundred employees. What, you? An American. - Certainly. Why not. At a cosmetics factory which the government converted. Well, you still can't fasten a torch. Yeah, that will hold. An inescapable bore. If it did fall out. If it fell over the side of the church .. It is my business. Now, he has got it so I can't get the idiotic thing out. Who are you talking to? To myself. I suppose you never do. Not when I am on duty. And I am standing three feet away from a rope I was ordered to hold on to. By what authority do you order me? No women ought to be allowed on post like this. There's only one risky spot. When I pass it I hold on to the rail, I assure you. Yes? Well, I am not taking any chances. Now walk forward slowly following me. This is outrageous. I don't intend to have to report an accident. Owing to the fact that some woman through her own inexcusable .. Look out! Can you hold on? Get way from there. Get some help. - No time to. You couldn't hold on that long. Honestly, I think you should telephone. - Don't talk. Try not to breathe if you can help it. Are you alright.? - Slipping a bit thanks. Keep away from there. - Shut up. Put your foot in that. Got it. Will that balustrade hold? - It has got to. Happy New Year. You have lost your torch. Go on. Drink it quickly. I'm alright. It is just that .. Do you know that legend about drowning men? When their whole life flashes before them. Well, it is true, you know. I found it out tonight. You saw your past? - Hmm. A sorry sight it was too. Empty. I had a feeling I've betrayed it. Are you very proud of your life? Mine? What has mine to do with it? We are cut from the same strip of cloth you know, you and I. The sort of forlorn people who do extra duty oh holidays. So someone else can celebrate. Maybe you are forlorn. Where did you spend Christmas? On another roof. In case of accident or death notify whom? My lawyer. Hmm. Same here. Freaks. That's what we are. A pair of freaks. Nonsense. Half way through life and the warmest high we can produce .. Is a paid fellow that does our business for us. Would you mind taking that thing off your head? Yes. I thought so. You are a handsome woman. I used to be pretty. You still are. - Ha. A fine strong line to that jaw. Handsome. I suppose you never cared a hang for anyone in your life. Do you indeed? Got you that time. You see, we forlorn middle-aged people come in two varieties. The ones who never cared. And the ones who cared much too much. And the others, the wise ones. Know how to compromise. They are very happy with their second wife or third husband or .. Someone. And we are alone. One doesn't make a choice of course. One slams a door in one's mind. At least I did. Slammed it and shot all the bolts. And afterwards .. Well, I had a job, thank heaven. I don't see how anyone gets through who hasn't. I wouldn't see people. Couldn't talk about it. You can't. You are talking now. I wonder why. Please go on. Are you sure you don't mind? When I was in the last war I was in France. I had a wife and son. When I came back they had gone. The flu epidemic. As simple as that. I am glad you told me. Thank you. How about you? Oh. Try. Go on. It is of no possible interest. I must be getting along. Oh, Miss Norris. I hope you didn't think I was trying to pry into your affairs. Of course not. Forget it. Yes. Let's do that. Let's start afresh here and now. Start what? The New Year. Properly. Let's go out to supper together. You are insane. Do you think you ought to consider it? No. Do you think you'd get a table on New Year's Eve? I will get a table alright. Will you come? I never go anyplace. Neither do I. The idea of going into a crowded restaurant .. Makes cold sweat come to my brow. But if you will come with me .. Alright. But I assure you, my dear mister .. Do you realize I don't know what your name is? Desham. Desham. Desham of the housing clan? Yes. I see. No wonder you think you can get a table, Lord Desham. I will go and telephone. Where's the phone? - Through the lobby and turn left. Thank you. Pardon me, Miss Norris. A gentleman is asking for you. For me? - Major. Here she is, sir. Are you the lady who donates the Piersen Falls journal to the reading room? Yes. I bring it in when I've finished it. Just on the chance. You are Jody Norris, aren't you? And you are ..? Bill McNair. Sit down. Wrong, Bill McNair. You used to live next to the Piersens on Circular Street. Wrong. Still live there. Was back three weeks ago. You saw the Piersens of course? - Wrong. Saw Corinne Piersen. Alec is in Washington. And .. Gregory? Still flying in The Pacific? - Wrong. New orders. He is stationed at Huddersfield where I am. He's due at Euston Station on the 2 o'clock train. Gregory is going to be in London? Tonight? - Right. This Lord Desham. I want to speak to Marcel. What Marcel do you think I want? The head waiter, of course. So sorry, sir. Marcel hasn't been with us for seventeen years. Oh. Well, I haven't dropped in lately. Well look here, I want a table for two. And you might put me some 1928 Cordon .. Well, the '36 will do. Yes. And can you roast us a nice pheasant? Lord Desham. They can do a powdered-egg omelette. I can't go. Thanks the same. - Tomorrow night? Nor tomorrow night. Something came up. I can't make new plans. It seems you're being flighty and capricious. I haven't time to quarrel. I'm sorry. - Oh, Miss Norris. The devil with it. There's a train coming from Huddersfield. About 2 o'clock. 2:12. Only it doesn't. Not tonight. The Huddersfield train? Oh, blast. What is it now? There's fog on the line. How long will it be? I expected him this morning. Waiting. Waiting. It's always waiting. - It will be here when it comes. Platform 3. Indefinite delay. Come along. Well, I guess we've had it. Are you going to wait? - Yes. It may take all night. It gets awfully cold out here. I am going to wait. - Oh. I think I will go inside. Sorry if I seemed rude back there. You were rude. We're all rude nowadays. It doesn't matter. - You see, my young man is a flyer. You can't imagine what it's like to be in love with a flyer. I can't imagine what it is like to be in love with a flyer. Ha. Can't I? Jody, could you quit that inventory long enough to .. Jody. Yes, Papa? What are you listening to? That funny drumming sound. Do you suppose it is an aeroplane? An aeroplane? Around Piersen Falls? Hardly. I don't hear a thing. A minute ago it sounded so plain. It wouldn't interrupt you to one of your beaus Jody. But there is now two of them at the soda fountain. Could you come before it gets really congested? Oh, Papa. My 'beaus'. You think everybody is a beau. Well, they've already had a couple of ice-cream sodas each. Don't let them wait too long. What started out as love might wind up as diabetes. Jody. - Jody. Hello Alec. Hello Mac. When did you get in town? - This morning. You go ahead. No. You go first. What I have to say to Jody will take a while. No. Go right on. I am in no hurry. Neither am I. Don't pull so. And let go. Boys, stop that. Stop it. While you two are settling this .. Hello Miss Jody. The kids want a penny's worth of candy. I feel just awful that I can't help you and the other ladies roll bandages. With the baby so little and me in my condition .. I think you are doing enough for the country one way and another. Kids, don't cross the street without me. Virgie, wait. Virgie. Virgie, come here. Where is Mac? That drummer? He went with your father. Who is he anyway? He traffics in wines, spirits and gents toiletries. Jody, I .. I have got to tell you something that my kind-of upset you. Yes? I've applied for a transfer to the Air Service. Yes, Alec. Is that all you have got to say? It'll be more fun than the Quartermaster Corps. It's not a question of fun, Jody. As the last Piersen in Piersen Falls it is up to me set an example. Yes, Alec. I guess you don't know the funny feeling you get when you sign that application. It hits you that .. Maybe there won't ever be another Piersen in Piersen Falls. No kid of mine to grow up in the old .. - Stop trying to make me cry. Corinne Sturgess cried. We got to really talking about things. What would you say if I told you I was going to marry Corinne? Oh, Alec. That would be ideal. And from what I hear. Corinne's father could use some new ideas in his pianola factory. Well, in that case I might .. Jody, let's quit this nonsense. Let's put our cards on the table. Won't you marry me? Won't you? Please. I've said no, Alec. How do you know you are not in love with me? Because I wish I were. I have tried to be. But I just can't. - That's a nice thing to say. That'll be nice to remember when I'm .. - Next. Now, Mac. The cut of that coat. That is our country's uniform and it looks fine. What have you got to sell today, Mac? - A mighty good product. What is it? - Myself. Dinner tonight at The Lake House. With a bond rally and dance afterwards. If we feel like it. Sorry, Mac. We're taking inventory tonight. Why this black spot on my record? You are too good a salesman for me, Mac. I don't have to push this product. It sells itself. As fiery as straight brandy. Smooth as an old port. Discreet as a fine sherry. And as modest as a dewdrop. You can't be modest when all the girls look at you and say: 'Hey knockout'. What is the matter with you, Jody? I don't know. You are not in love with that kid are you? No. Well, who are you in love with? Nobody. That is what scares me, Mac. For lots of people it doesn't happen to. Only you don't think you will ever be one of them. You got some kid's idea of what being in love feels like. You expect too much. You think all of a sudden everything is going to be upside down .. And sky-blue pink and different. Well. It it's not like that. Then I don't want it. [ Plane noise overhead ] Under the canopy? It is a plane. What do you suppose it is? It sounds like is right over the building here. There it is! I see it. People really flying. Just to think of it gives you a wonderful feeling. Watch that thing climb. It's one of the new Liberty planes. Wrong, It's a DH. He must be going at least 80 miles an hour. Wong. Nearer a hundred. Gee-whizz. Looks to me like he's in trouble. I'll say. That is what is happening in the skies all over France, ladies and gentlemen. The flier of that plane will speak tonight. And he will sell bonds. And when he asks you how many you want .. Remember he has been flying in France. Be careful of your throat, Bernadock. Well, when it is a question of my health or my country. Bond rally tonight at 8:30. G.A.R. Hall. Don't forget. Where's it going to land, Mr Clinton? - It's going to land .. It is going to land at the golf course, ladies and gentlemen. Come on. Let's get going, Cora. Put out your flag, Bernadock. And that is another day tucked away. Yep. As far as you are concerned. Now, it starts. What you complaining about? You had an hour's sleep last night and nearly two and a half the night before. Uhoh. You want a little snort before they start tearing you to pieces? And have all the old women sniff me and pray over me? It fits the cast, not being a hero. Captain Cosgrove. I am Bernadock Clinton. That was a magnificent show you gave us. This town is going to honor you properly or bust in the effort. The reception is ready right now. Then we have to stop at the Women's Club on the way though. The ladies have passed resolutions they'd like to read to you .. About what to do with the Kaiser. Then the Municipal Bank which we'd like very much for you to speak afterwards. But of course, maybe you want to .. Boys, move your bicycles please. Maybe you want to save your voice for the bond rally? We have six really good speakers lined up anyway. Cora, this is Captain Cosgrove. - Delighted. Captain, you sit up here on the back of the seat. That the boy. No, no, no. Up on the back of the seat. This is fine. But the people want to see you. Come on, up on the back of the seat. That's it. Thank you. Alright, Cora. Imagine Cosgrove. What a thrill for poor little me .. Driving a man who has been through battle and danger and .. I'm alright. Who is there? - I am. Quick. Lock the door. - What's the matter? If they find out he's here they'll mob the place. Who? That flier. Captain Cosgrove. - He is here? Yes. There's been an accident. It's surely taken the starch out of me. What happened? - A twig cut his eye. Oh. Is he badly hurt? Just a little scratch. Fix a cold compress will you, Jody. I haven't seen Mrs Clinton this shaken since she broke my leg. This may sting a little. I guess that warning sounds foolish after all you've been through in France. Compress, Jody. Just hold that over your eye. Capitan Cosgrove. He has fainted. Internal injuries. Captain Cosgrove? - Huh? Feeling badly? I was sound asleep. Hold this over your eye. Where can I find a bed? - Bed? Ha-ha. We are due at the mayor's reception .. - No to the mayor's reception. Why, you can't .. - Where is the nearest bed? You come and lay down on my couch. It's past closing time. You will be perfectly quiet. You can't do this to me. First, it's the mayor reception. Then the Woman's Cub and then the .. Listen. These last three days I've had about four hours sleep. I've done this stunt in eight towns. Figure that out in handshakes and chicken salad. Fat females firing foolish questions. I'll be at your bond rally. Until then, I sleep. But what are people going to say? Sir, I regard this as desertion of a fellow soldier under fire. Alright. Shoot me. You get on home and start supper, Jody. - Yes, Papa. I can't let him just like there. I've got to go to Mrs Clinton. Let the boy sleep. He is tired. You're absolutely sure about that, Jody? - What? That you won't marry me. - Absolutely. I must tell you I've been asked to the house of a certain party for dinner. Gee, I can't wait forever. I have only eight days of my furlough left. I beg your pardon. Three vital functions yet I must explain that Captain Cosgrove has to take a nap. He is. Well, chin up. This is war, you know. I must talk to Captain Cosgrove, Jody. - You can't. Don't you see? He can help me with my transfer. He can fix it. Talk to him as the bond rally tonight. - There will be too many people. You seeing him again, Jody? - I don't know. If you do will you ask him about me? Will you please? You are sure? Yes. I am sorry to have wakened you. I wasn't asleep exactly. Who are you? I am Jody Norris. This is my father's drugstore. It's a quarter of eight. Oh? The bond rally is at eight-thirty. You've missed your dinner so I brought you a sandwich and some coffee. Oh, thanks. What is the name of this town? - Piersen Falls. Any chance I could shave? Oh. My father's razor is here. I will heat you some water. This is good. I'm glad. Captain Cosgrove. I know you are tired of people asking you things but .. It is crowds I am tired of. Have you been flying long? Two years. Three almost. It's the best branch of the army, isn't it. Nothing can touch it. Is it hard to learn? My bunch picked it up by ourselves more or less. Six hours in the air and we are on our own. But there are schools now, aren't there? Yep. Yeah. I was an instructor in one for a while. At Clermont Ferrand. Oh. Well, I am asking for a friend of mine who is in the service. A nice steady fellow? - Yes. Known him long? - All my life. Fond of him? - Very. If there's anything you can do to help .. Sure I could. No trouble at all. That is wonderful He was in Company L from here and he is stationed at .. Don't bother. I am not going to. Somebody else can you get your boyfriend into this filthy mess. Not me. Don't you like flying? Sure I do. The way a drunk likes liquor. But. I get sober once in a while. I get moments when I know there is something else. A girl comes into a quiet room and .. Lights a lamp. Just for a second, things go clear. Plenty of jobs he can do on the ground. Dangerous enough. Let him stay there. But the wants it so much. Listen. Teaching people to fly? That is a joke. It's instinct. It's luck. That school. That crazy school. Sit down to lunch with 6 student pilots. You'll laugh louder than you ever laughed in your life. Only two of them are alive to eat dinner. Not lost in battle. Not shot down. Just a cross-current they didn't know about. The stick .. the judder roll. They see it from a distance. Believe me, it's not for your boyfriend. It's for the wild ones. The ones with nothing to come back to. And you fly. Yeah. And look at me now. Temper shot to pieces. Nerves twitching for that next nip of excitement. How do you think most of spend our time between flights? With a bottle of Cognac and any girl we can grab. Getting into messes that you couldn't even imagine. Listen. You put your arms around the boyfriend of yours .. And make him forget he ever saw a plane. The end of the recruiting speech. Thank you. Very much. Now then, ladies and gentlemen. Now then. It is your chance to be good soldiers. Just come right up and buy, buy, buy. The line forms over here. Buy all that you can afford and then beat down and by another. Will some of the boys help clear the chairs here so folks can dance please. Jody. Jody. Did You see him? - Isn't he wonderful? I mean, did you see him about me? - Oh. Yes. And? - He said no. You didn't ask the right way. - You can't bother him. I'll wait until he is through. - He explained why exactly. Please. We're trying to transact business. Do you mind? - Sorry. Did you say how well I drive an automobile? You're not the sort of person they want. - What's wrong with me? Nothing. You're nice a boy but you are a boy. They are men. They haven't been taught to fly. They just groped their way into it. That's just foolish. Maybe it's foolish living on your poor tattered nerves from day to day. Six of you at lunch and only two of you left at dinnertime. And all of it focusing on you. And you feeling there is nothing left for you. No future. Nobody to care. You make me sick. What has this got to do with me and my transfer? Have you forgotten? From now on you're not meant to quarrel with anyone but me. Hello, Corinne. - Hello, Jody. I suppose Alec has been telling you about us. No. We are getting married. - The day after tomorrow. Oh, that is just wonderful, Corinne. I am so glad for you both. Are you? Let's dance. Corinne? That was the boy? - Yes. But he's dancing with somebody else. - Yes. They are engaged. Why didn't you tell me he wasn't your particular boy? It would have sounded so silly. Would it? It's new, isn't it? Over here maybe. I heard it in Paris. The English words are terrible. "If you would care for me." "As I could care for you." "What a place this world would be." "A paradise for two." See what I mean? No. Please go on. Am I a beautiful singer? We are dancing. Captain Cosgrove. Captain Cosgrove. Don't look. I don't hear him. Captain Cosgrove. As I waited to do my speech they put me on a flat tin roof near the back window. Captain Cosgrove. Well, maybe not so flat. It's fine for the legs though. It stretches one, shakes one. We are making holes you know. So the rain comes in. So the snow comes in. And some sun and some stars. You should be very grateful to those people downstairs, don't you think? What? Was I saying something? Here I come. Fair warning. Captain Cosgrove. Much as I hate to interrupt you and Miss Norris. This is a bond rally, you know. And we promised everyone that you will autograph every receipt over a thousand. Alright. I have my fountain pen here. If you will just step inside where it is light. Wait here. Right here. I will send him back to you right away. What's come over you anyway, Jody Norris? What is the matter with you? The biggest transaction they ever had in Piersen Falls. I was just going to say goodnight. I have got to go home. - You're joking. No, really. It's very late for me. Goodnight. Way out there? I loved the dance. Did you? Please don't come with me. - Of course I'm going to come. Please. Hey, Babe. The plane is okay, sir. Nobody can touch it. I got the rotor in my pocket. That's what I thought. Give it to me. The young lady? Do you think you will run out of gas maybe? Babe, you cannot imagine how quick I get places when I run out of gas. [ Engine cuts out ] Oh, how lovely it is silent. Uhuh. This is what I hoped flying would be like. It's not so good. Jody. I have done a fool thing. I came away without checking the gas. We're out of gas? - Yes. But we are flying perfectly well. Well, we can glide for quite a while. After that .. Give me your hand, Jody. I'll do my best to get us out of this. And you will I know. Well, I've got to make a forced landing in the dark on strange territory. I am not afraid. Why don't you let yourself go and give me the devil? After all, I got you into this. It is my fault. It is just as much my fault. I wanted to come. Well. At least there is one good thing about being in a spot like this. It gives a guy the nerve to say things he'd never say to a girl he just met. What things? Why do you think I forgot to check that gas? Because I was thinking of you. Why do you think right now my heart is pounding so hard I can hardly stand it? Because I am looking at you. There is some sort of crazy magic between you and me. I knew it when we started to dance. The minute I put my arms around you. But I knew it long before. I think I knew it .. When you sat there eating that sandwich with such a sleepy face. Knew what? That it had happened. That I had found you. That even if I never saw you again there was someone I'd love forever and ever. Wait a minute, Jody. Cut it out. Don't. But what happened? You had plenty of gas. Sure I did. I was just trying out a trick of the trade. A what? We use it when we want to grab a quick kiss. Come on. I'll get you home. - But I don't see .. Don't you realize I'll be gone from here in three hours? I know you will. Well, isn't it pretty clear then? Love. Love, the way you think about it. It's a lifetime job. And I haven't any lifetime. Come along, will you. There is no moon down here. It is past two o'clock. You are leaving at five? Dawn is around then. Stop crying, will you. - I am not crying. Don't look at me, please. Don't Jody, don't. Will you please listen? Why do you think I am acting like this? Because I got a glimpse up there .. Of what it could be like with you and me. I know it as well as you do. And the only way I can say it. Is not to say anything but to take you home right now and .. Not even kiss you goodbye. Because you are only going to be here until dawn? As that's all the time you're sure of? - Come on. How much time do you think I can I be sure of? I have only got until dawn too. I make such nice medicine for everybody else. Why do I have to take one that tastes so awful. Hello, Jody. - Hello, Corinne. Hello, Mr Norris. I have to pick up the ice-cream for the country club luncheon. Oh. The freezer is out the back, Mrs Piersen. I will tell your driver. Any news from Alec? - Something too wonderful. The Red Cross has ordered eight pianolas. That makes us a war industry. Papa thinks he can get Alec back from the Army. Oh, lovely. It is so hot I think I had better have something to drink. Strawberry as usual? - No. Have you any milk? Just plain cold milk. Of course. Mr Norris. Mr Norris. Have you got something that's good for burns? Anything serious? The boys. They thought up a new game. Throwing firecrackers at each other. Lighted. I'll get you some salve. Why didn't you bring them in? They won't quit. Hello, Belle. - Hello, Miss Jody. Phew. This weather. Would you like something cool to drink, Belle? A cherry phosphate maybe? Could I have some of that milk? - Of course. What is this sudden craze for milk? Don't you like it? - Not a bit. You got to drink a lot of it when you are in my condition. It builds bone or something. That's right. Corinne. Oh. I am so glad. Oh, Mrs Piersen. And let me tell you this. Having children around is the sweetest thing in the world. The very sweetest. Mama. Mummy. You got to come. Michael has banged baby. He has been bad. - Now, Virginia. He has been bad. He swallowed my firecracker. Oh, my lamb. What will it be next? Was it lighted? Mrs Ingram, Mrs Ingram. Me. Five years from now. So long, Jody. Goodbye, Corinne. Well, I'll say goodbye now, Mrs Norris. Goodbye, Dr Potter. Thanks Mike, for giving your advice. Goodbye. Is there some doubt, Dr Hunt? About your condition? None whatever. Then why was a consultation necessary? You have been through a tiresome examination. Come in tomorrow. I hadn't expected to come back to New York for several months. Not until it becomes apparent and I can't work any longer. Come in tomorrow and bring your husband. He is in France, Dr Hunt. Oh. Well. Then you'll have to take it without a shock absorber. Dr Potter and I find a condition that calls for immediate surgery. Surgery? Either that or living in constant danger of peritonitis. And I warn you if that happens .. You think I will die? Yes. That is why .. Dr Potter and I think it should be done as soon as possible. It is not a grave operation. You will be out of the hospital in five days. Of course there isn't any question. There is one thing I must make clear. If we do this, you will lose your baby. I see. It is a hard thing to face with your husband away. You don't have to be kind. It is better anyway. Well now, let's see. When can I take you into a hospital? Well, I will have to go home first to make arrangements to be away. I haven't told my father about this. I shan't now. Who is this Mrs Cathcart you are going to visit in New York? You never met her. I never even heard you speak of her. Well, I met her at cousin Marge's last summer. And then I ran into her the other day at Siegel & Coopers. But to go and visit New York in the middle of summer? The queerest thing I ever heard. You've gone New York nutty. - I will only be gone a week. Spirits of Ammonia. Quick. - I am not going to faint. I just got a little dizzy. - You were so emotional, Bernadock. The Piersen Falls Journal ought not to post such news on their bulletin board. But it's wartime, Bernadock. I spent almost a half-day with that boy. I can see him now. Riddled with bullets. Gone down in flames. Who? That young flier who was here with the bond rally. Put your head between your knees, Bernadock. That's what they say at the Red Cross. Drink this. That's better. Now, do you want to lie down? I think I will go home, Cora. Thank you very much, Jody. Anything wrong with him? Father. Why so formal? You haven't called me that for years. You may as well hear this now. I am going to have a baby. It is Bart Cosgrove's baby. He has been shot down in France. They talk about him as if he is dead. Just dead. But he is not dead. Not while his baby is alive. And it's going to be. I don't care what the doctor said. I don't care if I do die. That baby is going to get its chance for life. Somebody is coming, Jody. Then you drop them in deep fat and fry them until they are golden brown. Good afternoon, Daniel. Afternoon. As usual, I need some more bicarbonate of soda. One bicarb. Anything else? No. That's all. Why so glum? Sorry. Well. Jody. There is no need to say it. I know how you feel. You have always been proud of me and trusted me. And I have betrayed everything you stand for. Turn around, Jody. We don't judge each other. Not you and me. We love each other. Oh, Papa. Hello, young man. He likes being with me very much. Can't you just forget him for a little while? Nope. Most babies are bald aren't they, Miss Gingras. Yep. I wouldn't like one that was bald nearly as much. Don't you think he has a brave little face? It's good the war is over or he might wriggle out of this blanket and enlist. May I come in? - Sure, doctor. We got the room alone now? - Mrs Ferroni is in the delivery room. You can hear her yelling all over the sixth floor. Hello. - Hello. I have just been looking at your X-Ray plates. Well? You are as right as rain and as sound as cricket. Which is pretty embarrassing to science. - Shall I apologise perhaps? You certainly should. I've got good news for you. This is my last visit. You can leave here tomorrow. Tomorrow? Well. Aren't you pleased to take that young man home? Of course. Thank you for my baby, Dr Hunt. I just hope he is half the man his mother is. Goodbye. Goodbye. The Ferroni kid has arrived. An outside girl. Ten pounds. Miss Gingras. - Yep? The doctor says I can leave tomorrow. Good. Do you know of a place where I can .. I can board my baby for a few weeks? You see. I live up state and the weather there is awful so I think .. Now, who do you think you are fooling? Oh. How did you know? Listen. A girl like you comes into a hospital. No visitors. No flowers. No letters coming in. No telegrams going out. For an old-timer like me that adds up to just one thing. Does everybody know? Uhuh. And I am not telling them. You sinned. You'll pay for it all the rest of your life. Me? I don't collect on those payments. I'll take the baby over at my place. Would you, Miss Gingras? My name is Daisy. And now that is settled will you please relax? It is not settled though. I have still got to smuggle him back into my life. That is easy. You say he's a war orphan. And his mother who died was your best friend. You've never lived in a small town. If I went back with a new baby and a story like that .. Alright. Alright. So in a week or two on my day off I take myself a little trip .. And I leave him on your doorstep. On the doorstep of a girl who has been away? Not in Piersen Falls. The more I hear of them cozy little towns the better I like the Bronx. You know Daisy, I've been thinking about this for a long time. And I've worked out a plan. - Yeah? I have got to hear about that baby by accident. Everybody in town must know it is just by accident. And how do we do that? - Well. You do leave him on a doorstep. Only it is somebody else's doorstep. What's happened? There are always customers. Shouldn't they have found him by now? Stop fretting, Jody. The little boy is in a basket wrapped in a warm blanket. Out in the sunshine. Someone will open that door pretty soon. - But he might kick off the blanket. Babies aren't made of glass. That baby of Mrs Piersen's, now .. Corinne had her baby? - A month ahead of schedule. Caesarean. Weighed 4 pounds. But I bet he is going to pull through. I tell you babies are tough. If it weren't so windy. Glad to see you back, Jody. - Thanks Miss Claflin. Mr Norris. I think I have taken a little tiny bit of a chill. It is so raw out. I wonder if you can let me have a bottle of whiskey. See? It is cold. It isn't cold Jody and Miss Claflin hasn't a chill. She wants some whiskey that I can't sell her on account of the prohibition law. Mr Norris. Miss Norris. We just found a new baby in our house. Good gracious. This time the doctor didn't bring it in a black bag. It came in a basket. On the doorstep. - I found it. Mama said, can she borrow a quart of milk? Of course. A baby on Belle Ingram's doorstep? Them that has, gets. Do you think I should go and see if there's anything I can do? Why don't you? - Come on, boys. You ought to see Pa. - He's getting drunk. He always does for babies. I don't imagine that house smells very good. Now, can I have a little drop of whiskey? Hello, Belle. - Did you ever hear the equal? This time it ain't my fault I swear, and there is my alibi. I found it first, didn't I mom. There was a note. He is a war orphan. They can't afford to keep him. They can't afford to keep him. They can't. What do they think we can do? Send him to the police station is what. Oh, shut up, Clem. - What can you do, Belle? If it wasn't for the new baby I'd keep him. You know, I like babies. Listen, Belle. Why don't I take him over to my house? But you are not fixed to take care of a baby, Moss Jody. I've got lots of room and plenty of time. It would help us out, wouldn't it Clem. Now, it's too late, my girl. Can I have him? - You sure can. I'm sure Casey will help me with the other end of this. Now wait a minute. You've got to get a lot of things before you move that baby. A crib and bottles and .. And dollies and dollies and dollies. Well, I will get them and be back in no time at all. Billy, take your hat off in the house. Four dozen diapers. And a dozen nightgowns. Oh yes, and the eight little dresses. Is that enough? A prince couldn't ask for more. And will take this. A pinwheel for a brand-new baby? Now, Miss Norris. He's got to have the best. Miss Jody, I've been looking for you everywhere. The most wonderful thing has happened. But that's a terrible thing to say because it's just as sad as it can be. What, Belle? You know Mr and Mrs Piersen? The little baby that came too soon? Well, they lost the poor little thing. And Mr Piersen heard this baby was left with us. You let them take him? It's a wonderful home. The best in the town. You let them take him! - Miss Jody. Miss Jody. Mrs Piersen please. Mrs Pearson is very sick. Mr Pearson then. It's about the baby. - Come in please. Just a moment, Miss. Miss Norris is calling. You should have waited downstairs. Come on up, Jody. Dr McLaughlin and I are celebrating a miracle. Hello Jody. That baby was promised to me. Mrs Ingram said you asked to take him. - She gave him to me. It was arranged. I was buying things. Anything you can't return I'm glad to .. - It is all arranged. It is my baby. Jody. You don't know what we've been through. I was away when it happened. Jody. Two hours ago I didn't know whether Corinne would die or lose her mind. Now come with me. I want to show you something. Don't speak please. Alec. Yes, darling? Come and look at him. Belle Ingram was in, Jody. I can imagine how you feel. I can stand it. It's only for a little while. A little while? You don't think I am going to leave him there, do you? As soon as Corinne is better, I will .. Talk things out with her. What are you going to tell Corinne, Jody? I will tell her he is mine. I'll tell everybody he's mine. - No you won't, Jody. I know this is awful for you. - I'm not thinking of me. In my state of health the scandal won't matter to me. Not for long. If you worry about me and my reputation .. You are grown up. I am not thinking of you. I am thinking of the baby. - He is mine. I have a share in him too. He is my grandson and he is not going to suffer for your faults. He is not going to be brought up a marked child. If the people of this town so much as suspect he's yours .. The little boy's life won't be worth living. I can't give him up. - You have got to. No. Can't you hear them whispering? 'See that little fellow in the sailor suit'? 'He is the Norris girl's baby'. 'He hasn't any father. He never had one'. Don't. Jody, honey. You haven't any choice and you know it. We tried to get away with something. It didn't work. Are you here, Jody? Who is it? - Alec. Mr Norris, is ..? Oh. Corinne sent me Jody when she heard how you felt about giving up that baby. She asked me to tell you something. We don't want to seem selfish about the kid. You are welcome any time. That is very kind of Corinne. You don't know what it means to lose your first-born child. I hope you never will. "They named him Gregory Sturgess Piersen after Corinne's father." "But I was the one who found the pet name we called him." "Griggsy." "Thursdays and every other Sunday." "Those were the days I lived for." "The nurse's day off." [ Piano music ] You know what this is? Paderewski's minuet. Practically the way Paderewski plays it. We are going to get his endorsement that it is his favorite interpretation. Printed on every roll. It's Alec's idea. If that doesn't start people buying pianolas again .. There is my boy. He was laughing. He loved the music. Of course he does. Gregory has got fine taste. He wouldn't laugh for a cheap squeaky old gramophone. Roll him and roll him and roll him. Stop flopping around, Griggsy Piersen. Drying you off is like trying to dry a little trout. Really. Did you put the baby on this bed at all? While I filled his bath. He's swallowed a safety-pin. No. I folded this diaper with three pins a side. Now one is gone. Open or shut? - Open. We mustn't get panicky. You have let that baby swallow a pin. I love him more than anything in the world. You don't love him any better than I do. - You love him so much? I'll never let you come near him again. Never, never, never. Stop crawling around that floor. We've got to get him to an X-Ray. What the deuce? Jody let Griggsy swallow a safety-pin. Is your car outside? We must get him straight to the hospital. Now, look at this kid for a minute. He doesn't feel it yet. - You flatter the kid. With the practice I've had I couldn't swallow a safety pin. Children do. Stop talking. Come on. If he has, there's no time for a doctor. I've got to get that pin myself. You? You girls have the nerve? Now come closer. One, two, three. And success. I thought we had lost you. - Oh, Griggsy. Now break it up girls and let me have a glimpse of my son. Come on, fellow. Goodness. They just scared to you death, didn't they. Want to see something he likes to do? Come on, Griggsy. Oh Griggsy, darling. Come on, Griggsy. Come on. Come on. May I, Corinne? Of course. This is the way the lady rides. And this is the way the gentleman rides. It is time he got dressed. He hasn't finished his rides yet. Let him practice, Corinne. He's nearly the right size for a jockey. This is the way the farmer rides. You two seem to know a great deal more about this child than I do. He is going to be dressed and have his supper. What's the matter with Corinne? I make too much of a fuss over the baby. I know I do. I will apologise. Goodnight, Alec. Aren't you staying for supper? I don't think so. Not tonight. Hello Jody Norris. Why, Mac Tilton. What's that you work at so hard? - Oh, nothing. Let's see. - You wouldn't be interested. You are a big girl to keep a scrapbook. I thought you gave up the road when prohibition came in. Well, sure I did. - What are you doing here? I've been on a trip to Canada. Driving along I saw a sign 'Piersen Falls 40 miles'. And the car jumped right out of my hands. That's very pretty Mac. But why really? For just that reason. I've wondered about you so many times. Were you married? Were you as pretty as ever? Were you still here? Behind the same old counter. - But that is a crime. Is that Mac Tilton out there? It sure is. Pretend he looks alright. - He's been sick? Now, now, now. Well, old-timer. You look just fine. Yes. Don't I, Mac. I feel like I have been hit by a truck. Did you hear about the man that got run over by a steam roller? No trouble at all. They took him home and slipped him right under the door. That's good. We'll let you rest, darling. Good to see you, Mac. - And you. What are you going to do when he is gone, Jody? Sell the store. Pay our debts. And find myself a job. - In this whistle-stop? My best friends the Piersens run the big pianola factory. You are not counting on that? Pianolas are dead, Jody baby. That factory will be closed inside of two years. You come to New York. That is the place for you. I don't know anybody there. - That is not true. You know a very influential man. Why, Mac. Did you catch the car? Come on. That is yours? Oh Mac, it is a beauty. Yep. That's mine. Things are going on in the world. You folks around here just haven't caught on. For heaven's sake, Mac. What business are you in? Well, I am kind-of a promoter. Well you must promote something wonderful. I call it Lady Vivian beauty products. V-y-v-y-a-n. Class, huh? You own the company? - I am practically Lady Vyvyan. Listen, Jody baby. You come to New York. I will never leave here, Mac. You come to New York where the money is. Money. You don't know what fun that stuff is when you get your hands on it. How warm it makes you feel inside. How nice it makes other people act. Money. Head waiters like you so much. Ushers at shows find you such lovely seats. The way Pullman porters brush your coat. Every darned stroke a caress. Money. I am going to get you in on it. Everything I love is in Piersen Falls, Mac. By everything do you happen to mean some special guy? Yes. The one in the scrapbook? - Hmm. So. You went and fell in love when I wasn't around. You found yourself that brand-new sky-blue-pink world? Eighty miles wasted. Are you going to marry him? It would surprise me very much. Oh? Obstacles, huh? That is wonderful. Want to talk them over with kind uncle Mac? No. You're too close to this problem. You think because there's just one guy in this hick town you can go for .. That there's just one guy in the world. Get away and you'd get over it. Never. Well. I guess the answer to that is .. goodbye. Goodbye, Mac. - Goodbye, Jody. Oh, by the way. Why don't you paste this in your scrapbook too? That is my business card. You see I am a hopeful cuss. Oh, Mac. Miss Norris. Come in. I am so sorry to hear of your loss. Thank you, Ida. Jody, how good to have you here again. Hello, Jody. I haven't had a chance to really thank you for all your help. Come and sit down. - You sold the drugstore, I hear. Yes. Made any plans? - Well. Alec, do you mind? I would like to talk to Corinne alone. Of course not. I'll take my red ink to the other room. You know, if not for one Indian tribe preferring pianolas to gramophones .. I don't know where we would be. - Oh, Alec. Yes, Jody? I have to get a job. Would you let me come here as Griggsy's nurse? Live here? - I'd like that very much. You know how I feel about Griggsy. Yes. I do. That is why I don't think it would be wise. I won't spoil him. Promise. I won't even discuss it, Jody. It is impossible. You don't understand. I think I do. Will you look at this. It is Griggsy's birth certificate. He is my own baby. I have thought so. For some time. His father was Captain .. - You needn't tell me these things. They make no difference. No difference to know Griggsy's is my own .. He was your baby. He's not anymore. I have the papers of adoption. You adopted Griggsy? So whoever it was that gave him up couldn't come back and claim him. For just that reason. But I never gave him up. - You made no open claim. The court gave him to me. Corinne. He is all I have got in the world. You have got everything. A home, a husband. You will have other children. I haven't a husband though. Not really. I know that now. Alec married me because he couldn't marry you. Oh, Corinne. You're harking back to a silly schoolboy crush that Alec forgot years ago. He hasn't given me a thought since he married you. No? He never kisses me. He never turns to me that he doesn't wish it were you. We could have been happy. Only you sit in my chair. And sleep in my bed and poison the air I breathe. You imagine. One human being really loves me and needs me. My little boy. I will never give him up to you. Never, never, never. - Corinne. Wait, wait! Alec, Alec. Corinne has an insane idea that you're in love with me. Will you tell her it isn't true. - I've tried to, Jody. Well, make her believe it. - Yes, do. Corinne, we went through this before. - And you wanted to tell me. And almost said the words but were afraid. Why don't you stop lying? - It is not true. Tell her, Alec. Tell her. It's no use, Jody. She knows. She knows just as if she was inside me. I am not going to lie about it anymore. I love you, Jody. I always have. Thank you, Alec. You didn't want the truth. What did you want? Corinne .. wait. Don't talk to her while she's like this. - Corinne! Listen, Jody darling. Don't touch me. Don't come near me. Jody. Do you hate me? You have come between me and my baby, Alec. Griggsy is mine. My own. - Jody. Corinne was right then. What are you going to do? - I don't know. Go away. - Is there anything I can do? No. Yes. There is. Write me about him. Send me pictures. Barry. Stop playing with that light, Barry. Barry. Listen to your mother, Barry. Barry. Stop with that light playing around. I am going to send your father down. You will see what you're going to get. Barry. Barry. Barry. Barry. Listen to your mother, Barry. Okay, okay. Cut it again and put the Kentucky label on it. Someone is outside asking questions about Lady Vyvyan again. I'm getting a tip from the city hall. Right. They got a line on us. - Quit squawking. Why do you think I pay out all that good money? Well, this joint is starting to smell. - Cut it out. Who is asking what questions? A cop or a plainclothes man? A woman this time. She says her name .. - Shush. Blow, you jug heads. - What about the rest of the load? Blow. Jody baby. You were right, Mac. Her I am in New York. - Alone? Have you got a job for me? - You bet I have. Oh, thank heavens. The thought of this job just saved my reason. All the way from home I've been thinking about Lady Vyvyan. Ideas for selling. Ideas for the product. Well, your job wouldn't be with Lady Vyvyan. Exactly. But why not, Mac? That's what I would be good at. Papa used to make wonderful cold-cream and face lotions. Only he charged so little that nobody had any faith in them. Save your breath, baby. You may as well hear the facts. There is no real Lady Vyvyan. There is a sign and some equipment but that is as far as it goes. Then why did you give me that card? Why did you build up my hopes for nothing? Not for nothing, baby. I'm not just making mud pies. I'm in big business. Once in a while a chance for real dough comes along. Like the railroads when they started. Or gold in Alaska. This time it's prohibition. You are a bootlegger. That's right. And how would work into that? Do you know the Savoy Carlton hotel? First, you go there and get yourself a nice big suite. Across the way there is a big wide bank. That is where you open yourself a bank account. About half a block away is the best fur store in the world. I always kinda pictured you in a mink coat. Oh, Mac. - Okay then. Sable. This is silly. - Oh. I forgot to tell you. About four blocks away there is a jewelry store named Cartier's. We go in there together and pick out a wedding ring. Oh, Mac. You are the one girl in the world I would say the hard words with. Dear old Mac. It is okay then? - No. It is goodbye. What I want is a job. A job for the future. Well, what is wrong with my future? This isn't some little hick town. I got my protection organised. I sit pretty, with guys planted on the force and in city hall and up in Albany. Why, it is sewed up so tight and so .. legal. I'll tell you about it in a minute. Hey, Captain. Tilton? Search warrant. This is a cosmetics plant. - Where do you keep the hooch? Now, just a minute. Don't hand me that if you don't want another count in your indictment. We've found it, Captain. - Yeah, about 2,000 of these. Okay. Come on. Come on, boys. Get going. Is that you, Andy? It's me. They said you would be out on bail. It is sweet of you to hang around but .. You don't want to get mixed up with a guy like me now. I'm here to talk business, Mac. Are you kidding or crazy? I am out of business. Five thousand dollars for bail. Ten thousand for my lawyer. My entire stock smashed. I'm cleaned out. - Yes, you're out of one business. But you have got another. Come here. These things work you know. Put wax and lanolin and perfume in that and you've got cold-cream. That is the machine that puts it in a jar. Those jars you can sell. Who wants to sell cold-cream? I am the guy who makes rot-gut for 2 bucks a quart, and sells it for 15. You'll get a dollar .10 for something you make for 4 cents. No police raids, not bail, no lawyers. It takes money to start a business. I haven't a hundred bucks in my pants. - I've got twenty. With what you have got, will that make a hundred? For a hundred dollars you can make two thousand jars. You are the best salesman I know. You can sell those jars in a day. Yeah. Then? We make thirty thousand. Then a hundred thousand. I've a friend named Daisy Gingras who'll go in with us. I called the wholesale supply house. It's open until midnight but no deliveries. Here is a list of the stuff we need. And here is my twenty dollars. You're thinking of starting now? Sooner you start, the sooner you've something to sell. Now, wait a minute. We got to eat. Get some hamburgers. These things are filthy. I've got to scour them out. Go along. Hurry up. And I thought I was a go-getter. Jody. Why are you doing this? For somebody I love. I've got to make money in a hurry, Mac. The guy in the scrap book? - Yes. I'd like to get a hold of him and kick his teeth in. Please don't, Mac. They are such little teeth. He is only sixteen months old. He is my son. He is quite a fellow, isn't he. Where is his father? Dead. You poor kid. Marry me, Jody. Please. When you have been wildly and deeply in love, Mac. You don't stop loving just because somebody dies. And certainly not if there is a child. It is the same love. But you are young, Jody. Pick up the stuff, Mac. Or the place will be closed. It sure isn't the way I figured you'd spend your first evening in New York. [ Radio: ] "8 o'clock." "And Lady Vyvyan Beauty Products presents:" "The Week In Review." "A program fresh and crisp." "As Lady Vyvyan products." "Play of the week." "A fashion show of 1924." "Picture of the week." "Flaming Youth with winsome Colleen Moore." "Fashion of the week: the tube dress." "No shoulders, no hips, no waist." "It is adorable." "Song of the week." "Let Lady Vyvyan songsters tell you." That's pretty. I'm glad you like it. It costs us $1,500 a week. $1,500 a week? Since it started last week our sales went twenty percent. Twenty-two. As I did this on my own, I need a vote of approval. Before Mac sails for England. Imagine us starting a factory in London. All in favor? - Aye. So enter it. Meeting adjourned, fellows. - Wait a minute. English business methods are different from our own. Here are facts and specifications you must know before you open negotiations. Now promise me you will study these on the boat. I swear. Now can I go? Is stage door Johnny number one still seeing the music box revue every night? Same aisle, same seat. A different girl though. - A new tramp. How about coming over to my place, sweetie? Those new puppies are the sweetest thing you ever saw. I'm staying here. I've some letters to write. Aren't we rich enough now? Turn off the center light, will you. - Okay. Goodnight. That kid is around again, isn't he. He gets in tomorrow. I can always tell when you're boiling up for one of those half-baked reunions. You can't sleep so you work all night. Alec sent me this. A ticket for the rodeo. Next to Griggsy. Another one of those 'accidental' meetings I suppose. They have to look accidental. Otherwise Griggsy might mention them at home. He is so smart. I wish they lived Kamchatka and never came near New York. Don't say that, Daisy. You see just enough of him .. So that you don't get any life of your own outside this cosmetic business. It's like keeping somebody alive by feeding him with a medicine dropper. Goodnight. Goodnight. But it does keep me alive. Hi, young fellow. Will you hold this handkerchief for me? Yes, sir. Hold it way up in the air. Thank you. Here. I'll hold you up so you can get it real high for him. Now watch him. Watch him. He is getting ready. He is standing up. Hold it up high. I held it for him. I held it for him. You sure did. Where's your program, Griggsy? Is this yours? Yes. Thank you. She is crying. Do you want a hankie? Thank you. The cowboys don't get hurt, you know. They look as though hey do but they don't. The cows have awfully long horns. Those aren't cows. Those are steers. They can't get up here. Are you sure? Will you protect me if they do? I will grab their horns and twist them down. This is the first rodeo I have ever seen. Cowboys that stay on longest get prizes. The funny ones are clowns. Balloons. Ten cents. He'll be down here, Griggsy. He might sell them all. - Okay. One for you, one for the brother and one for the baby. The baby is too ill. You'd better get three. The mortality rate in balloons is awfully high. Hello. Is he always as gay as that? - Nearly always. You should see those three kids together. I'm bringing all of them to town next time. That is if there is a next time. If? The pianola business is sunk, Jody. If I can't raise some money to convert the factory I don't know what happens. That is why we came to town. - To raise money? I've a meeting at the bank tomorrow morning. Cross your fingers for me. Look, Dad. Look. Wait a minute. You don't get a 'her'. You get a 'he'. - I want my dad to see him. That's alright. - Look, Dad. Look, Dad. Say, that is a peach. It's Carol. Queen of the rodeo. No, no, no. It's Carol. The Queen of the corral. Isn't she the best that ever was. She's got real eyelashes. - How much? That is not for sale, mister. That is what you call a 'come on'. Balloons at ten cents. You want me to hold one of these for you? The green one. - Alright. Thank you. They're pretty, aren't they. Do you want to hold one? - Thank you very much. That is alright. Hello. - Hello. I'm the engineer. Do you want to buy some coal? Well, I .. - Jody. May I come in, Corinne? Of course. Go deliver that coal that mother bought into your bedroom. I delivered it. Well, there's some people down on Maple Street who want coal. Go and sell it to them. Shut the door. You have two children of your own now, I understand. Yes. A little boy almost three and a baby girl. Meanwhile, you have become a very successful person they tell me. I have been lucky. - I am glad. Well. I know you're busy. You didn't come here just to pass the time of day I presume. You are quite right, Corinne. I want Griggsy. We had all this out four years ago. Nothing has changed. Except your financial situation. You have heard we are hard up. You are not hard up, Corinne. You are bankrupt. Nonsense. We are going to convert the factory. They want us to make radio cabinets. Alec is getting the money right now. Yes. Alec is at the bank. The bank is waiting to hear from me before they give him his answer. From you? I have been carrying obligations of yours for some time. So you have found a way to get even with me. I don't want to get even with you, Corinne. I want to cancel your notes. I want to give you and Alec enough money to put the factory on its feet. But I also want Griggsy. Griggsy is not for sale. You've got your other children to think about, Corinne. No. Griggsy is not for sale. Now will you please leave. Very well. Murray Hill 8500. What are you doing? - Calling the bank. Security Trust Company? Mr Anderson please. - Listen. I will have to talk to Alec before I decide. I'll have Mr Anderson put him on. What are you going to tell Alec? That you are going to throw away his one single chance? Your children's one chance? You are incredibly cruel. Come, come, Corinne. That is no word to use between us. Not you and me. Mr Anderson? Miss Norris speaking. About the Piersen loan. - Wait. Just a minute please. I will have to have some time. I want to leave here with Griggsy. Now? This morning? What do I say? What do I say? I'll tell Griggsy. Wait a minute. Mr Anderson. Go ahead with the loan. Whatever Mr Piersen needs. I don't want you to see Griggsy alone. I don't trust what you'll say to him. You are right to be worried. It won't work. He loves us. And we love him. For four years I've never slept without pretending his crib was beside my bed. My whole life has been built around him. Working. Waiting for the day. There is so much love stored up for that little boy. No. I am not worried about Griggsy. Call him. I say, where are you old thing? Where the jolly well are you? We were meeting your boat at 6 o'clock. Docked two hours early. - How is the London situation? No shop talk. I'm here to meet that kid. He's at the park with Daisy. You'll see him in a minute. I needn't ask about you. I bet it's been like a honeymoon but twice as good. Maybe just as well I wasn't here. - Come on. I've finished. Who is this? - Carol, the Queen of the corral. It is a surprise for Griggsy. I've been tracking her down for two solid months. You never spent two months buying me a balloon. I tell you I am getting jealous. Here they are now. Come along. I don't know how it's going to hit me when I see that kid run into your arms. Hello Daisy. Mac Tilton. Gee, it's good to see you. - And you. How are you? - Fine. Hello darling. Hello. Here. Let me help you with that. - I can do it myself thanks. Was the park fun today? It was alright. - Did you meet any people? I saw someone who looked like Mr Jenkins. Who is Mr Jenkins? He is my dog back home. This dog wasn't funny like Mr Jenkins though. No? Is my face dirty, aunt Jody? Not very. Why? You keep looking at it so hard. I am sorry. You are always being sorry. Here's an old friend of mine, Mr Tilton. This is Mr Griggsy Piersen. Hi, skipper. Boo. He thinks I am silly and he is right. Listen, skipper. You're going to get a peach of a surprise before long. Something you'll really like. Have you got him another expensive toy? - This isn't that kind of surprise. I have seen her. She is wonderful. The surprise is a lady? - In a pretty hat. When do I get this surprise, aunt Jody? When? How about right now? Please. You are wonderful, Mac. Come along. Now shut your eyes. Now. It's the balloon. You don't like it. What is it, Griggsy? Nothing. - No. Tell me. I thought maybe it was my mother. Alright. He is homesick. It's only natural he should be a little homesick. A little? - Don't exaggerate. He'll get over it. He calls you 'aunt' Jody. Haven't you told him you're his mother? Not yet. You have to wait for the right moment. If that isn't the happiest news in the world for a child like Griggsy .. It would be horrible. Now, wait a minute. That's a regular kid. That is no problem child. No. I am a problem mother. Well, he's just not used to the place yet. After more than two months? - He'll snap out of it. Maybe he will and maybe not. Don't say that. Don't be glum about it. He is sure to eventually. Listen, Jody. I know what I'm talking about. You see, I was sashayed myself when I was his age. My mother was kind-of a tramp. My grandmother couldn't stand the way I was being raised. She took me. She was a sweet old girl, I guess. Cookie jars, birthday cakes. All that junk. But kids aren't logical. I happened to love that boozy little mother of mine. Was I homesick? Well. Alright. You were miserable and homesick for a little while. How long did it last? A year. A year and a half. There you are. That's exactly what I mean. You got over it. Yeah. I turned into a dandy, grumpy old maid always fighting myself and everybody. Why talk like that? You're being horrible. The cases aren't similar at all. I know you can see that. Well. I've put in my 2-cents' worth. So long, sweetie. Mac. So long. Just one more thing. You know, that sweet old grandmother of mine? I hated her guts until the day she died. Now, I'm going to tell you something. You go right in that room and tell that kid you are his mother. Not yet, Mac. I am the one to decide when it is time for that. The time is now. Is it, Mac? Right now. Go on. Griggsy, darling. Yes, aunt Jody. There is something I want to tell you. Come here a minute. It isn't easy. And I want you to help me. Yes, aunt Jody. Have you ever wondered why Corinne, your mother .. Let you come and live with me? I guess you asked her. Yes, Griggsy. But why did I want you? Because you are lonely. Yes, Griggsy. But why you especially? I don't know. That is what I am trying to explain. You see, Corinne and Alec loved you very much. But you were their adopted child. Do you know what 'adopted' means? - Yes. I do. Once, back home the Jones kids called me that and my mother explained. And that is why she loves me better that the others. And you haven't any right to talk to me about it. Griggsy. Well? You didn't tell him? I am not his mother. Not really. I know that now. Just bringing a child into the world doesn't make you that. It's being there always. It's nursing him through whooping cough and measles. And knowing what to say when he is hurt. It's all the things I've missed. Get me long distance. I want Piersen Falls, New York. The number is 1-6-2. I want to speak to Mrs Piersen. Is there anything I can do? Yes. Let me go to London. And find me fourteen hours work a day. Yes. I am holding the line. The Huddersfield train? - That's right, ma'am. No-one off yet? - No, madam. Are you Lieutenant Piersen? - No, ma'am. Lieutenant Piersen? - Not me. Lieutenant Piersen? No, ma'am. Lieutenant Piersen? - No, ma'am. Lieutenant Piersen? Lieutenant Piersen? - No, ma'am. Lieutenant Piersen? Lieutenant Piersen? - No, ma'am. Oh, dear. Do you know him? - No, ma'am. But I can yell that out real loud for you, ma'am. Never mind. You are Lieutenant Piersen, aren't you? I sure am. How did you know? - From old photographs. I used to know your mother and father in Piersen Falls. I heard you were coming in on this train. My name is Norris. You don't mean you got up at this ungodly hour to meet me? Well, Major McNair didn't know where you would be staying. I am not quite sure myself. Well, that is what I thought. Accommodations are so hard to find. And in case you didn't have any I might be of use. That's swell of you, but a friend of mine promised to attend to it. How long is your leave? - A week. Do you know London? - Only from above. Well, I have lived here for more than twenty years. And in case you'd like somebody to show you the sights, I'd be glad to any time. I certainly appreciate that but I'm afraid my time is .. Things like theater tickets. I thought tonight perhaps you'd like to see the new musical play at The Palace. It's called 'Something In The Air' and they say it is terribly funny. Griggs! Griggsy. Liz. Oh, Griggs. The most foul luck. My leave has been cancelled. Now? I almost missed you altogether. Holy Canarsie. When do you have to punch in? Five this afternoon. - You've only got until five? It's all a mess. I couldn't even find you a room. I looked all over London. Oh. This is Liz Lorimer. Mrs Norris. - Miss Norris. Hello. I couldn't help overhearing. I have a guest room I would be delighted for you to use. That's wonderful. It sure is. And if Miss Lorimer is going away and you will be lonesome. Perhaps you will dine with me and go to see the play? Oh, sure. Sure. I live in Richmond Court. Just off Grosvenor Square. That sounds good. Now, how about a nice a hot breakfast? - Rather. I'm starving. Oh. You'll come along, won't you? Thanks. I've had breakfast. Leave that here. I'll get it home for you. That's the kind of treatment you get when you are from Piersen Falls. See you later. - Goodbye. Unload me, will you. Where do you want these? - On the table. He wants all those towels with only five inches of bath water? Give him best eiderdown. Anybody would think Winston Churchill was coming to stay. Where does the book go, Miss? That is not for here. I want to lock it away. Miss, you do look such a treat. Thank you, Dora. Do me up, will you. After four years this zip has gone on strike. Where did you put the tickets for tonight? On the telephone table in the hall, Miss. Hold still, Miss. Please. I can't do you up if you're darting about. Sorry. I'd say this is on strike. Sorry Miss. Did that tickle? People's smiles never change do they. There we are. [ Buzzer ] Never mind. I will go. You get the cocktails. [ Buzzer ] Oh. I thought .. - Norris? Yes. Sign here. I can guess who they are from. Wasn't it a young American? - I only deliver. I expect there is a card. Thank you. Oh dear. I should have given him a tip. Well, that is a shame. Well. You are dining with me tonight. Desham. Oh. I am, am I? Thank you, Lord Desham. [ Buzzer ] Never mind. - I know. You'll go. Hello, Miss Norris. Gee, the most terrific thing has happened. She told me her train went at five and really it left at four-thirty. Well, holy Canarsie. Don't you see? She missed it purposely. Just so she could be with me. Look. I got exactly twelve minutes. I feel awful using your apartment as a hotel but you understand, don't you? It really is terribly important. Do you mind if I wash and change? Oh, Of course not. I've put your things in here. Now, what is all this rush? You can't go to the theater? No, no. I can go. The bathroom is in there. - Thanks. I mean, in a way I can go. Look, Miss Norris. This is a terrible thing to ask. You spoke of getting tickets to the show at The Palace? That's right. You can't buy them for love nor money. I know. I had to pull strings. I'd never have the nerve to ask her myself, but .. That is the one show that Liz wants to see. She has to go back to her camp tonight and .. I thought maybe you could see it sometime later and .. Well. Would you sell them to me? Of course you can have them. Gee Miss Norris, you know something? What? - You're swell. I'll let you get cleaned up. Don't go. Stay and talk. Where is Miss .. Liz .. now? I'll go and bring her something so she can take the last train tonight. How about dinner? We're eating after the show. We forgot lunch but we had tea twice. Well, there is a table reserved for two at The Ronsard. You can have that. Swell. Do you have enough money? You sound like mom. I am rich. I am a pilot. And we've had an awful day. Awful? We spent of it trying to get married. You can't just get married in England. You have to post banns and things. It takes forever. Fifteen days, isn't it. That's what I said. Are you terribly disappointed? What do you think? You seem pretty gay. I got to be. Liz is so blue. I've got to make her enjoy this evening somehow. Your tickets will sure help. How much are they? Let me give them to you. I tell you I am rich. Just to give me pleasure. You are out of this world. Will you give me something else? What? - A hug. Now, where are those tickets? You will be seeing plenty of him. He's going be here a week. A week. What am I looking for? Oh, Those tickets. Dora. I must have put them in my room. I've found them, Miss Norris. Oh, good. Why, these are of my when I was a kid. Yes. What is this book? It is a scrapbook that I started for your mother years ago. But never sent it. You know, for a minute I forgot that you were from back home. Wait now. What is your first name? Josephine. Why, you are the aunt Jody I stayed with when I was a kid. You didn't like it very much I'm afraid. Well I .. I missed the folks, I guess. Look at all this stuff that Liz and I had to fill out. It wasn't any good. Well. Next time. Goodbye. - Goodnight. You can have breakfast any time you want it. Well, I'm going back to the field. Didn't I tell you? Tonight? Well, I can't get married until I get another leave. And I can't get another leave until I do 18 more missions. So why waste time? Gee, you've been nice. I. I have loved seeing you. Well, goodbye. - Wait a minute. These are for Liz. Well, I say. That's wonderful. Thanks. Bye. What the blazes? Where are you going? - Gee, I am sorry. If you've broken that bottle of sherry you'd better be. It sounds alright. I am looking for a flat of a Miss Norris. Top of the stairs. The one I just came out of. Hey, wait a minute. Yeah? Where did you get those flowers? They're for my girl. Swell, aren't they. Your girl, eh? That's right. Hmm. Blast. [ Buzzer ] Miss Norris? - Are you expected, sir? Dispose of that. Oh. I had forgotten about you. You can't go about saving people's lives and treating them like this. It just isn't done. Yet I let my job go to pot while I comb London for orchids and rare oak sherry. I'm not going to dinner with you. - We'll discuss that later. Why did that hooligan take my flowers? - He is not a hooligan. You have been crying. - Yes, I have. Not about that boy? - Yes. But he's young enough to be your son. - He is my son. Though he doesn't know about it. And he never will. Oh. So that is what you couldn't talk about. He is a fine boy. You must be proud of him. I hoped for one week I was going to have him around. Just around. You are not going to? He is going back to camp. His girl's leave has been cancelled. They ran into a lot of red tape about their marriage. Those poor children. Wandering around all day. I should be feeling sorry for them, not for myself. You would like them to marry? That's what he wants. I would like to give him the sun and the moon and the stars. All his life I have wanted to. I thought for this week I could feel like a real mother. Showering things on him. Spoiling him. All he wants is his girl. I can't help him with that. After twenty years, what have I been able to give him? Two theater tickets and a table at The Ronsard. I'm sorry. You can see I am in no condition to go out to dinner with you. Make it supper. At the Ronsard. - No. It will give you your last glimpse of him. They will be saying goodbye. I can't intrude on that. I said a 'glimpse'. We will be at our own table. But look at me. - You look charming. I'll give you two hours to pull yourself together. Alright. Good. The devil with the war. I shall wear a black tie. I'll be back. "Boop, boop, tittum tattum, bottum choo." "Boop, boop, tittum tattum, bottum choo." "And they pham and they pham all over the dam." In the last war they played tunes that meant something. 'They pham and they pham ..'. I tell you it is insane. Here they are. [ Band music: The Bridal Chorus ] Do you hear what they are playing? It is terrible for those children. I don't suppose you could ask them to stop it? Well, after all, they haven't bought the place. I guess somebody has just been married. Well, something of the sort, sir. Now. You mustn't let this get us down, Third Office Lorimer. Of course not, Lieutenant. At least it shows that people can still get married around here. They haven't lost the formula. As a youngster I used to get a great pride from being in a place like this. With the very prettiest girl. All boys do. Boys? I'm getting it now. Is there a Wren officer here by the name of Miss Lorimer? That means trouble. She missed her train you know. And what can they do with a refractory Wren? Clip her wings? It is not a laughing matter. Watch. My leave. My leave has been extended. Holy Canarsie, Liz. What does it mean? Her leave has been extended. I phoned the admiralty. Oh. Bless you. Ahem. What are you up to now? Get your things together. What for? Get your things together. Come along. Come on. If you'll excuse me sir, will you and Miss Lorimer step this way? I thought this table was too good for a Lieutenant. Just follow me, sir. I tell you I don't like surprises. I am afraid you will have to get used to them. Where are you taking us? - You'll see in a moment, Miss. Holy Canarsie. Do you mean we are going to get married? We can't be. We haven't got a license. - The banns have been waived. But nobody can do that except the Archbishop of Canterbury. Exactly. What is this? A present from Miss Norris. Holy Canarsie. Holy Canarsie. Will the bride and groom please sign the marriage licence. Look. To keep the records straight. That birth date on my application is just approximate. I am adopted. - That makes no difference. This isn't a present from Miss Norris. This is a present for Miss Norris. There will be another one after the ceremony. I am going to tell that young man. - No. No, you mustn't. - I am going to. No, please. You don't understand. The witnesses are here? - We are indeed. Here is the ring, young man. If you say 'Holy canary', I shan't give it to you. I am speechless. I thought of everything. Blast. The wedding cake. Do you wish a cake, sir? - It's too late now. Not at all. Dearly beloved. We are gathered together here in the sight of God. And in the sight of this congregation. To join together this man and this woman. Wedding cake. Which one this time, sir? Army? Navy? Tank or Air? Air. Air, yes. Air. Air. Air. Ain't she beautiful. There is something missing here. - Which? An actual piece of cake. The Air Force is pretty popular in this war. That's the 79th time this cake has been used, you know. Yes. I am afraid it's getting a bit battered. Put that down and open the door. Bring the cake right away. Come on. - Yes, sir. We're just dreaming this, you realise. - Let's try to remember it though. You are not to tell him. I absolutely forbid it. He has got a mother he loves. He has got a bride. He likes me now. He is grateful to me. That is enough. If you tell him I shall never forgive you. I have got to say it, sir. Holy canary. How can we even begin to thank you. Why should you be so wonderful to me? Strange, isn't it. You are both Americans. Not enough. Both from the same little town. Not enough. - Lord Desham. Why don't we dance? A pleasure. Well, if you ever figure it out. Let me know. And they tell me there wasn't any Santa Claus. That wonderful Miss Norris. Was she terribly fond of you when you were a little boy? I saw the way she looked at you when you signed the register. Anyone would have thought you were her own son. That l was her ..? Excuse me, darling. I think this is our dance, mother. Griggsy. ..(r0s)..
