(A demon can enter a person's body in many ways.) (One of its entry points is through the feet.) It may seem awkward to start this story to talk about the significance of doors as an entry, or an exit. But I've to start the story this way. Because the occupant behind this door has let something in, and he doesn't wish to let it go. Mum, I'd like some tea. Where are you going? I'm meeting Fiq and the rest. Who are "the rest"? My other friends. They must be women. They are all men! This kid. Why are you wearing shoes inside the house? What did I say? You're always so anxious. Look, they are clean. - I keep them clean. - Clean? I've prepared your drink. - It's tea, right? - Yes. Yes! Drink slowly. It's too hot. I'm already late. Why are you in such a hurry? My friends are waiting for me. I'd better get going. What time will you be back? Later tonight. I'll update you. Peace be upon you! Peace be upon you too. You're so full of excuses. Haqim! How have you been? You good? You're late, as usual. - Isn't that Dre? - Yes. Dre, Haqim is here. Hey, how have you been? You're late again. Don't be so obvious. The previous girl was long-haired. This girl is short-haired. What a playboy. I know your taste in girls though. Girls with braces give you good sensation, right? That's right. What can I do? That's my taste. This guy is into pious girls. Pious girls who can recite the Qur'an. And he is into... Since you're late again, you have to treat us as usual. I want satay! I can't. I'm still jobless. You're still looking for a job? I'll message you later about a job opportunity. You're the man! You haven't changed one bit! You'll always have an excuse. A deal is a deal. If you won't, I dare you. - Dare! - A dare, all right? Let's go with the dare then. - See that girl? Ask for her number. - Which one? That one. - That's an old woman. - That girl in front! How would I know that she's married with a child? That's not fun. Let's find a non-Malay. - That'll be hard to find. - You mean, a Filipino? Not a Filipino. Hold on, let me find one. That girl in black by the red table. The one in black. She is so fair. Her fair skin will turn red if slapped. So, do you dare to? Me? If I get her number, I won't have to treat you, right? Okay. Okay. Sure, no problem. Hurry up. We're hungry! - Where is he going? - How should I know? I give up... Why are you following me? Why are you following me? No, I'm just walking in the same direction. Are you visiting someone here? Yes, I'm visiting my friend. He lives on this block. He may have moved out though. How much? How much is the bet? So, you know about the bet? Well, I saw you with your group of friends, and now you're here with me in front of this empty block of flats. Unless you are... - Of course not! - So, how much? Thirty dollars' worth of satay. Thirty dollars? Cheapskate. What do you have to do? I need to get your phone number. Then pass me your phone. - Really? - Yes. - Are you serious? - Yes. There you go. Is this number really valid? By the way, my name is Haqim. You are? - Midori. - Are you Japanese? Why are you walking in this direction? To see if you're following me. So leave now before I scream. You're crazy. Scream then. Nobody can hear you. Thank you! My mum has messaged me, asking me to go home. Where did you go? - I got it. - What did you get? You dared me to get her number, right? I got it. - Which girl? - The one you pointed at. - That one has walked away. - Don't try to be funny. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Why are you still awake? I'm not sleepy yet. - What are you watching? - I have no idea. Then why are you watching it? You're definitely sleepy. I've told you time and again to take off your shoes outside. They are clean. You always like to talk back. All right, Mum. Your voice sounds so soft. - I'm sleepy. - Go to bed then. I'll switch off the TV. - Good night, Mum. - Good night. (Midori) Hello. How did you know I just got home? Why ask if you already knew? How could I ask you to come along? I'd ask you out if I weren't with them. So, have you thought about it? Yes. I've thought about how I could be a property agent. No way. I can talk to my friends, but not strangers. You definitely can. Yesterday, you asked a random girl for her phone number and disappeared. But you said it wasn't the right girl. That's why I'm not suited for this job. Are you trying to fool me? How would you know unless you've tried fooling me before? Because I have done it before, that's how I know. No wonder you're paranoid. You've done it yourself. - Are you a fool? - Useless. This is for your future. I just want to help you. - Hilmi. Come here. - Yes? Say your goodbyes. - What do you call this? - Kendama. - See you. - Okay. (Midori) (Midori) Hello? Hello, is this Midori? Is the reception bad? Hello? Hey, hi. Is this Midori? I'm the guy you met... I don't have time for this. What? Nonsense. How could she hang up on me? Hello? Hey, you. What are you wearing? Are you... naked? What? Now I recognize your voice. Why did you lower your voice? You're so cute when you're shocked. So, I hope I saved you your dinner? About that, don't take this the wrong way. My friends were pointing at a different girl. You got it wrong? Were you supposed to approach someone else? I thought they were pointing at you. Are you sure you made a mistake? Or did you follow me because you wanted to? It was because of the bet. I promise. Can you keep your promise? What is she saying? I said, what are you wearing? Are you naked? You shouldn't ask such a question. Why can't I? What if I were to ask you, "What are you wearing? Are you naked?" Hey, if I ask you, I'm cute. If you ask me, you're rude! - Haqim. - Yes? - Aren't you asleep yet? - Soon. Go ahead and sleep first. It's late. Get to bed. I have to go. - Okay. - So, you haven't told me why you called. I called because I wanted to. How much? What do you mean? How much do you want to talk to me again? - Very much. - Good night. She didn't give me a chance at all. She just hung up. It's okay, only because she's Japanese. Why do you want to join real estate? Has any one of you have a relative or... - See you. - Haqim. How was it? Okay, right? - It was good. - It's easy, don't you think? - Come, I'll treat you to dinner. - Hold on. Another day, please. I have a date tonight. A date! With whom? I've told you the other day. It's the same girl. Mi... Mido... What was her name again? Midori. - Midori. The Japanese girl. - Yes. Are you sure you're meeting her? I haven't seen her. You've never shown me her picture. Do I have to show you? She's my date, not yours. Next time. - Let's have coffee then. A quick one. - All right. - Hi. - Hi. - So, we meet again. - Yes. How was class? My class just now? It went well. It was very good. Real properties, real estates... Seriously, it was really... boring. What are you looking at? - Please don't... - Your shoes. What's the matter? I prefer your other pair. The yellow ones. Impressive! You're really observant. You even noticed my shoes. So, what else do you notice about me? But not that, please. Well, I notice you have very interesting fingers. Oh, my fingers. They are clubbed. It's genetic. I got it from my late dad. Sorry... Why don't you answer that? This call? Because it's not important. Your girlfriend doesn't know you're on a date? So, you're saying this is a date? I'm joking. Don't you have someone special? I used to. - How about you? - Me? Of course. I'm not that ugly. I had a girlfriend. We were together for a couple of years. We nearly got engaged, but... as the Malay saying goes, "It's not fated." That's the main reason why I quit my previous job Because she worked in the same place. What about you? My ex-boyfriend was Malay. Seriously? A Malay? So, you like it circumcised. Don't mind me. So, what happened? "It's not dated." No. Let me be your Malay teacher. It's not, "It's not dated." It's... "It's not fated." I can be your teacher. I'll teach you. She messaged again. Don't mind it. Where did you go? I got home long before you did. How was your class? Liza called just now. Please call her back. Are you done rapping? Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - That's more like it. This is not a rap battle. I'm tired. Something smells weird. - Look at your shoes. - It smells fine. I've told you to take off your shoes outside! You must have stepped onto something. Go wash your feet! I don't smell it. - That's enough. Go wash your feet now. - Yes. - I have to take off my socks first. - Yes, take them off. The smell is overwhelming. I've put on expensive perfume. Please listen to me. Go wash your feet. Are you sure the smell comes from me? You should take a shower. I'll bring you your towel. - It's okay. I'll go get it. - I'll bring you your towel. I'll get it myself. - So, you said you were nearly engaged? - Yes. I was with this girl for two years, but it didn't work out. My friend, Fiq, called to meet me. So, we met up. Fiq confessed he was seeing Shikin all this while. I trusted them so much, especially Shikin. I even let her take care of Fiq's son. I didn't know what to do, but I wished them well and the best. That was so sweet of you. Sweet, right? Let me tell you something. My family didn't know about this. My mum was so upset. Why didn't you fight for Shikin? I'll share something with you. There's a quote by Professor Haqim. He said, "Love can't be forced." "If you love the person, you should let the person go." What? Are you for real? What did you say? I mean, maybe you gave up on her because you weren't sure. Maybe you didn't really love her as much as you wanted to. Maybe if you meet a girl who is so precious to you, then you would do whatever it takes to keep her. Haqim? You there? - Hello? - Hello. Is that too heavy for you? Okay, let's talk about something else. So, what are you wearing? Are you naked? This joke works really well. It can still make me laugh. - Haqim? - Hold on. Yes, Mum? Are you still up? I'll be done soon. Please go to bed first. Are you on the phone with Liza? Please go to bed first. It's already late. Sleep now. Hello, Midori? I got to go. - I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Okay, good night. So, both of you will be working together? Yes, soon. Are you okay with being his stand-in? Yes. I'll have to pass the test first. Yes, a test. That's interesting. Speaking of tests, are you still "testing" that girl? I "tested" her for two weeks. Two weeks are considered good, okay? You normally last for two hours. Two minutes. That's how long you can last. If she's good. Speaking of girls, remember the girl whom we dared this guy to get her phone number? This guy is now seeing her! And she's not Malay. She's from the Land of the Rising Sun. Maria Ozawa! But not her. Midori. Good for you! I haven't tried a Japanese girl before. - You're jealous, aren't you? - Of course. But what about Liza? What about her? You can take over. I don't care. - Sam, you want her? - No, thanks. I could see you had so many problems. Sam is looking for true love. Bring her here. We can take a picture and upload it on Facebook. "Japanese girl enters hawker centre." I've already told him. Bring her here to try our nasi lemak. - Yours or mine? - The stall's nasi lemak! Be clearer next time! Come on, bring her here. Or are you afraid we might steal her from you? That's not it. I don't mind at all. Midori may not want to see the likes of you. When you're done testing girls, and when you've met your religious leader or your Celebrity Chef Bob... Nonsense! I'll bring Midori, and you bring Shikin. We'll all go out as couples. He has mentioned Shikin's name out loud! - That means he's really okay! - Praise be to God! Of course he's okay. Go ahead and shout "Shikin"! Let's shout "Midori" instead. Midori! I don't care. Bring Midori here. We'll wait. - Midori! - Don't joke around. I'll treat her nasi lemak! Mum? Mum, did you just get off work? Why are you using the stairs and not the lift? Why are you grumpy? Let's go. Hey, Midori. Are you busy? Yes. You seem angry. I called many times, but you didn't pick up. I'm sorry I had to cancel our meeting. I'm not angry. I had a bit of fun just now. You did? What kind of fun? Hey, I don't ask what kind of fun you have with your friends. So, don't ask what kind of fun I have. Are you sure you aren't angry? You sound jealous. Anyway, my friends would like to meet you. Okay. So, what did you say? I don't know how to introduce you to them. Simple. You say, "Hi, this is Midori." I mean, I don't know if I should introduce you as... Midori, my friend? Or... Midori, my girlfriend? You're not going to be my boyfriend. No way! You're not my type. Oh, I see. I got to go. Confirm? Confirm that I'm not your type? Confirm that we're meeting tomorrow? Or are you going to cancel again? Sure, let's confirm it then. Good night. "No holding of transaction monies. No estate agent or salesperson shall hold or handle any money for or on behalf of any party in relation to any of the following property transactions. The sale or purchase of any property situated in Singapore and..." The lease of HDB property. Good. Next. "No referral to moneylenders. Any person who contravenes paragraph 1 shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding..." Twenty-five thousand dollars. Or is it twenty thousand dollars? - Twenty-five thousand dollars. - Let's have a break. I can't focus. It's noisy downstairs. Studying Japanese is much easier. Do you want me to stop the buses for half an hour? We've only revised for half an hour. Don't be an idiot. Your house looks the same as before, but all the pictures have been taken down. Why? Shikin doesn't like them? Why didn't you answer? Answer it. I know it was Shikin. No need to be embarrassed. She knows I'm busy. Are you still seeing Midori? At least show us her picture. Tell us more about your relationship. Is she a woman or a man? She's real, right? See? See the name? Midori. See, she's real! Hello. Midori! Good afternoon! Honda. Yamaha. Suzuki. Nissan Sunny. Samsung. Wait, that's Korean. Kendama. - "Iku!" - Idiot! Hey, my son is around! Was that Fiq? Yes. That's so naughty of him. Sorry. How long will you be there? Not that long. Did you say Fiq has a son? Yes. How old is he? He's seven years old, isn't he? - Seven, turning eight. - Seven, turning eight. I'd love to meet him someday. - Hilmi! - Midori, I'll call you back. Haqim! Hilmi, please wake up! What's wrong? Hilmi! Call an ambulance! So, how's your friend's son? I'm still waiting for Fiq's update. But he sent his son to KK. KK? Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital. If only there were a hospital to fix a broken heart. Broken heart? Whose heart is broken? Okay, I don't want to beat around the bush. I'll go straight to the point. Midori, I actually... like you. Like, a lot. Well, I like you too. Like, a lot. Are you sure? You said I'm not your type. You're not my "boyfriend" type. You're something more, like... soulmates. Soulmates? I'm feeling hot. That's deep. Soulmates, you say? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Are you? Very sure. Can I ask you one more thing? What's... your religion? Why? I mean, I just want to know. You know I'm a Muslim, right? And... You're not a Muslim for sure, right? Does it matter? I haven't seen you pray. A Muslim man can only marry another Muslim. I just want to know whether you have any religion. Buddhist? Christian? Taoist? Whatever. Or no religion? Well, my religion is the same as everyone else's. Love. That's not the same. What's so special about your religion? Why can't you convert to mine? You don't have to pray to love. Midori, let's not joke about this. Why do you think I'm joking? Does your religion teach you to love? I'm a Muslim, but I don't pray. Not all Muslims pray, okay? Even my mum doesn't pray regularly. But you need to convert for us to be together. So I can be a Muslim, but I don't have to follow the rules? Then what's the point in converting? Midori, you're making things so difficult... That's not actually allowed in Islam. So, you've never kissed a girl before? A Malay girl? You really corner... You... You're so cute when you panic. Midori... Yes? That kiss we had just now... felt so special. I felt like it was my first real kiss. I think you kissed quite well too. So, what are you wearing? Are you... Naked? Do you want to see me naked? Do you want to? No, you cannot. That's not allowed in Islam. You must be a good Muslim boy. Midori, what are you doing? You can't do this! So, what are you doing? Are you going to pray? What? Hey, I don't want to talk to you any more. Good night. Are you angry? You're so cute when you're angry. Hey, what's this? I'm cute when I'm angry, shocked, and in panic. It's not funny. I'm sure you're cute when you get naked. Midori, you're getting from bad to worse. I think you'll like me when I get worse. Kendama. "Iku!" I seriously don't want to talk to you any more. Bye. Midori. Haqim, I've made you some tea. Drink it. Careful, it's hot. Put your phone aside. You're always hooked on your phone. What's wrong? - Did you add sugar? - Of course I did. Mum, this isn't the usual tea. It's okay to add sugar to black tea. But this is Japanese tea. You don't need to add sugar. - I didn't know. I'll make you another cup. - Thanks, Mum. Haqim, I need to talk to you about something. What about? I need money. What is it for? It's for Diana, who else? How much do you need? Not much. Just 2,000 dollars. I still have enough savings. I'll pass the money to you later. I'm just very concerned. You're already 30 years old and jobless. How can you survive? Your savings will deplete eventually. When will you introduce me to Liza? - Liza? - Yes, Liza. You're constantly on the phone with her. You've been going out regularly. You've been meeting her, right? What will people say? I'm embarrassed. Where did he go? Haqim? Haqim! See? He disappears when I want to talk about him! He doesn't even close the door! What if someone barges in? That boy! He even asked for tea! Who is going to drink this? What kind of tea is this! It's so bitter! Japanese tea? Ridiculous! You look cute. Yes, I think so too. Thank you for saying that. But some days, I settle for beautiful or sweet. I'll wait for the day when you are better at speaking Japanese. Thank goodness you're cute. If not, I'd have pinched and slapped your cheeks. Do you understand? Of course I understand. Do you think I'll ever let you pinch and smack me? You can try, but you won't like the results. I'm so blessed to know you. Maybe I'm your curse. I'm sorry. Sorry? Why do you say sorry? Don't leave me. Don't say that. Haqim? Haqim... Haqim... What is this? My goodness. Where's the rag? Oh, God, please ensure the safety of my children. Bless their life. Especially Diana, who is far from home. May she pass her exams. Oh, God, please watch over my son, Haqim. May he find a job soon. Ameen. Oh, my goodness! Why is there a snake in the house! Oh, God. What is happening? Oh, my goodness! Oh, God! This is so scary. Mum. - It's so scary! You frightened me! - Hold on. - What's wrong? - There's a snake! - What snake? - A snake, that's what I said! What snake? Were you dreaming? I just finished praying! - What did you pray for? Snake bite? - Stop fooling around! I'm really scared! Mum, step out. Let me check. - I'm really scared! - I'll handle it. - I'm sure you're scared to be bitten. - It's so scary. I don't know what my mum saw. How can there be a snake in my HDB house? Hold on. A snake, you say? Hello. I don't know. My mum... How can there be a snake in the house? Do you want to see my "snake"? See it again? It's my turn to be naughty. Haqim! Mum, there's no snake! Oh, my goodness. No snake, but now I have a bump. Oh, my goodness. How was the test, Haqim? I don't think I can pass. Why not? We've revised together at my house. I gave you tips. This property business is not for me. I feel it's best if I quit. Haqim, you just have to focus. If you can give your time to that Japanese girl, why not this? Hold on. I'm not your son. You don't have to lecture me on what I should do. Do you really think I'm unaware of your true intention? I just want to help, that's all. You can save it. So, you want to redeem yourself by giving me this job? So that we're even? So our problem is settled? You're wasting your time and mine. I tell you right now, that we're even. I hope you're satisfied, friend. Rubbish. Hey, don't be so upset. No, I'm no longer upset since you're here with me. Hey. Do you know that you're the best thing that has ever happened to me? Did I say something wrong? I've heard those words before. Don't worry. I'm not like other guys. But what if we can't be together because of religion? Do you mean you don't want to convert? But I thought you would. What if I convert to your religion? Your Love religion? Don't joke around. Midori, why are you so serious? No wonder you broke up with your Malay ex-boyfriend. Come on, Midori. I cannot drop my religion just like that. You should understand. My mum... Then I've already lost you. No. Like I've told you, we will work this out. We must work this out. Here. I promise you. I swear. Can you keep your promise? Good grief. Midori, please don't speak Japanese whenever we argue. But you said I'm cute when I speak in Japanese. I swear. No matter what happens, we will still be together. You're my soulmate. What if, other... They can't. A promise can be made without thinking. But once it is uttered, it can be binding. - Hi, Mum! - Diana. I've received the money. Tonight, I can party! Hey, don't go anywhere! Save that money. Your brother isn't working. Only I am. Do spend wisely. I was only teasing you. Why so tense? Of course I'm tense. Your brother is always coming home late. Always on the phone. I don't know what to do. He's old enough. Let him be. He's probably out to meet his girlfriend. Relax, Mum. You're old already. Stop nagging! How dare you! I sent you to study overseas and you dare call me a nag! - Let me tell you. - What? - Your brother... - What is wrong with him? When I was praying the other day, a snake entered my room! Mum, you live in a flat, not in a village! How can there be a snake? Are you becoming senile? - Are you on medication? - Don't say I'm senile! It's true. I'm not lying. You know I'm terrified of snakes all my life. A snake entered my room when I was praying! Your brother came to my rescue. I ran out of the room. Then, I went back to check. Oh, my goodness... - And then... - And then? And then... And then what, Mum? And then... Then what? Mum? And then... Mum? Mum? - Oh, my goodness... - Mum! - Mum, what happened? - I fell. Let me help you up. Slowly... Sit down. Hello, Midori? I can't meet you for the next few days. Something happened to my mum. So, I need to take care of her. Hello? Midori... Say something. Don't be silent. Never mind then. I'll call you back tomorrow. Okay? Sorry. Hi. We have a visitor! Are you Liza? - Yes, I'm Liza. - How are you? - I'm fine. What about you? - I'm fine too. I had a minor fall. I've only heard your name but never seen you in person. - You're so pretty. - Thank you. I'm going to the kitchen. Have a seat with Haqim. - Let me help you. - No need. You're our guest. Have a seat, please. I've been calling you, but you didn't answer. Adrian said you have a Japanese friend. No wonder you're ignoring me. My parents aren't home tonight. Do you want to come over? You naughty girl. What did you say? Liza? Haqim? - Let me help you. - Thank you. Haqim, what's up with you? There's a guest here. Sit over there. That table is small. Haqim, I'm talking to you. Don't be stubborn. Don't embarrass me. Liza, have a seat. Haqim. What do you think of Liza? I really like her. She's pretty and polite. If you're ready, so am I. When shall we go over to propose? What are you talking about? Liza and I are just friends. If she's a friend, why did you ask her over to meet me? You can ask her why she came over. I didn't ask her to. She's your friend. Why should I ask her? You asked me why, but the problem is, she came on her own. I'm talking to you nicely. You know? I'm responding nicely. She came on her own. Who have you been calling day and night then? - Someone else, not Liza. - Someone else? Who then? A Muslim? Who were you speaking to when I saw the snake in my room? What are you talking about now? I told you, I'm with someone else and not Liza. Haqim. You've changed. I just want you to get married to Liza soon. What about that time... What happened between you and Shikin? What now, Mum? From Liza to Shikin? I don't understand what you want. Don't raise your voice. Haqim? Don't talk to me in that tone. I'm just asking you. I'm concerned about your future. So now I'm telling you softly. You can ask Liza and Shikin together yourself. - I'm going to my room. Go talk to them. - How dare you! Your mum is talking! - I'm going to my room. - Don't you dare give me attitude! Hi. Hi. I didn't think you'd come. Surprise. Your Japanese friend isn't free tonight? Do you want to... I want... some tea. You want some tea? Wait here. You naughty girl. You sound so sexy when you speak Japanese. You're going to die. Hello? Peace be upon you too. Yes, he's home. Why didn't you call his phone? Who? To God we belong and to Him we shall return. Was she sick? She just came over to see me. Haqim, wake up! What's wrong with this boy? Haqim? - Move aside, Mum. - What's wrong, Haqim? What's wrong with you, Haqim? Oh, my goodness. Haqim? What's wrong, son? Oh, my goodness. What did you eat? Ma'am. - This is Adrian. - Were you the one who called? Yes. - Did they just leave for burial? - Yes. Why are you dressed like this at a funeral? - We were from work. - I'd like to ask you something. Where's Haqim? Haqim is at home. He's sick. He's been vomiting nonstop. Can I ask what happened to Liza? Was she sick? I don't want to be alone tonight. What can I do to help you feel better? Haqim, where were you? You didn't answer my calls. Let's go up and talk. I'm going out. Let's have a quick chat here. What do you want? I want to ask you. Did you receive a message from Liza? She's dead. What message are you referring to? She messaged Dre before she died, saying, "Nobody wants to admit it." Did you get it? "Nobody wants to admit it"? I didn't get it. Do you know that Liza was pregnant? So, what has that got to do with me? I asked because you were seeing Liza before she died. We're all concerned about you, you know! Did she die right after going out with me? She might have been with someone else. She was so easy. Anyone could try her. That's one issue. Fiq's son is quite delirious. He's speaking Japanese. Are you still seeing Midori? How much did Fiq pay you to be his errand boy? I didn't object when he went after Shikin. Does he want to mess up my relationship with Midori too? If he or his son is delirious, what has Midori got to do with it? Just because they are speaking Japanese? What do you think Midori is? A ghost? Look, ever since you started seeing Midori, lots of bad things happened to our friends. Just look at Liza. Fiq's son. Even your mum fell. That's enough! Shut your mouth. Stop right there. I don't believe all these happened because I'm seeing Midori. That's illogical. I will only believe it if Fiq is dying. I don't want him to die simply like Liza did. I want to see him suffer before he dies. Then I will believe it. What is wrong with you? That's all, right? I'm leaving. Haqim! What is this? What happened to you, Diana? I don't know. I've not been feeling good for the past few days. - Are you sick? - Yes, I am. Have you taken any medicine? Not yet. I'll take some later. Do take some, so you'll recover fast. Take care of yourself. You're so far away from home. Mum, I'm old enough. You don't have to tell me what to do. I know what I should do. Stop nagging at me. I'm already feeling sick. I'm not nagging. I'm just concerned. You can still talk back despite being sick. I'm so worried! And here at home... I have to go. Your brother is back. - Great. - I'll talk to you again later. Go nag at him. I want to rest. Bye. Haqim, where did you go? I went to meet Fiq. Don't lie to me. Your friends said you've been seeing a Japanese girl. Who is she? What's this? You'd rather believe them than your own son? Why this sudden talk about a Japanese girl? Look! I've just started talking, but you're already raising your voice. You've been going in and out, without telling me. You're becoming insolent. This is not a hotel! You asked. I answered. Yet you're dissatisfied. Haqim! Don't you have any respect? No manners? Liza has just passed away. Why are you rambling about a Japanese girl and Liza? I told you, there's nothing going on between Liza and me. Stop being rude! How dare you raise your voice! There's nothing going on between Liza and me! Don't raise your voice at me! How dare you be so insolent! I'm going into my room! Go to your room then. So insolent! You don't listen to your own mum! Do I fit your... imagination? Midori, not now, please. Why not? Do you prefer Liza to do it? Let's not mention her. Why are you so disturbed? Is it because of your religion again? Your mum? Your friend, Fiq? Midori, I need to ask you something. Ask me. I don't know how to. Then don't. Hilmi? Wake up. Are you okay? Did you wet the bed? Get up. It's all wet! What's wrong with you? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Follow me. Have a bath. Go have your bath. I'll wait outside. Hey, Shikin. My son is at it again. He wet the bed. Why don't you come over? I'm joking. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Hilmi, are you done? Hurry up. Hilmi, stay inside! Don't come out! Hilmi. Hilmi! What are you doing? Wait. Why are you here? Hilmi, wait here. Don't go anywhere. Hilmi. Hilmi. (I'm not Shikin, you fool. Stop it.) Jackass. Haqim, where are you? We're at the hospital. Fiq is in critical condition! Is that him? What's wrong with you? You don't reply to our messages or calls! Liza is one thing, but Fiq is like a brother! What is happening, man? Where are you now? I'm talking to you. Why are you keeping quiet? Where are you now? Hey, Haqim! - What did he say? - He hung up. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, madam. Is Haqim home? Haqim? Hasn't he come out to eat or use the toilet? I don't know. Thank you for coming, Sam. I'm at my wits' end. I'll get you a drink. Help me, Sam. Okay. Haqim. Haqim! Haqim! Is it true? Are you going to leave me? Is it true that you are... You're going to leave me. This can't be true. Do you... still love me? You're going to leave me. Haqim? I'm off to work. I've cooked you some food. Haqim... Haqim, please don't do this. Have pity on me. Haqim, please open the door. I've prepared some food for you. Haqim, open the door. I'm going to work. Don't treat me like this. Haqim. I just want you to be happy. Please come out. I promise you. I'll accept it if you wish to be with the Japanese girl. Open the door. I'm going to work. Please open the door. It's okay if you don't want to see me. I just want you to eat. That's all I want. Have pity on me. Open the door. Don't do this, Haqim. Don't treat me like this. Open the door, Haqim. I'm going to work. Please eat. Madam. It's here. Are you sure? Madam. I'm worried about Haqim's behaviour. That's why I've brought my friends here. Haqim is in one of his moods. It's probably because he's stressed out since he's jobless. He's constantly on the phone. Nothing to worry about. Forgive me for asking, but have you noticed your son behaving strangely? I've been busy working. I've been working. Lately, there have been a lot of strange happenings affecting our friends, like Liza and Fiq. Fiq is now in a coma. All these happened ever since Haqim went out with the Japanese girl. Look, madam. I believe Haqim is being disturbed. We suspect he may have a supernatural companion. How can you believe that in this modern day and age? No, we shouldn't entertain such thoughts. My son is stressed out because he's jobless. I'm certain of that. If that's the case, do you have a spare key? If you have, we can check how he is. - Spare key? - Yes. Please understand. We're only trying to help. One more thing. Before you find the key, could you get us a piece of cloth and a cane? A piece of cloth and a cane? Haqim? Haqim, are you okay? Your friends are here to visit you. Haqim? - Haqim. - Haqim, are you okay? Haqim! Haqim! Mum, please make me some tea. Haqim... Don't come any closer. Don't come any closer! It has appeared. There's another one. What? Another one? He belongs to me. Restrain him! Quick! - Please be strong. - Haqim... What you're seeing isn't really your son. What is happening to my son? What is your name? Answer me. What is your name? He belongs to me. What do you want from him? Release him. If I get out, ten more will enter. You better release him. Or else, I'll make you leave! Go ahead. Hold him tight. - He'll feel the pain! - Hold him. Give me his feet. Hold him tight! Are you going to release him? Release him now. Mum! I'm in pain! Are you letting him go? Mum, help me. Release him now! Let him go now! Haqim, I'm here. Oh, my goodness. I'm here. Please be strong. - You've promised me, Mum! - I'm here. Let him go now! Mum! Mum, you've promised me! Get out of his body! Release him now. Go ahead and torture me! I'll expose your secrets! I'll expose your secrets, one by one. You... I know what you did to your sister. Stop pretending to be good. I know you've been lusting after Shikin. Ibrahim... You're no match for me. You can expose all our secrets, but I know your secret. He belongs to me! Get out of his body now. Or I'll burn you! Let me go. All right, I can let you go. But you must promise to get out of his body. I promise. Do you promise in the name of God? You can stick to your God. He is of no use to me. I promise on my own religion. You have a religion? What is it? Let me go. Sam, let him go. Haqim... Haqim... It's me, Sam. There's Dre. So, what is the secret that they wish to protect? The secret that separates us, from them? The secret, is about belief. They don't want us to know that they exist, that their influence can be rationalised, but always brushed off as mere coincidence. It isn't important to know where they come from. It's more important to know where they choose to stay, and if you let them in. We're still trying to help this family be free from the disturbance. But we have our limitations. Because the promise made seems stronger than the secret itself. Now that you know the secret, do you believe? Subtitles by lyuno-SDI Group
