LEVIATHAN Good evening, Mr. Gu?ret. Black coffee as usual? Yes, very strong. D?jame en paz. Leave me alone. Turn off the light Come on, Ang?le! It's past six, we 're closing. Goodbye, Madame Brod. Yesterday I left alone, He followed me all the way home. I thought he was going to talk to me. And he didn't? Why? Perhaps he's not like the others. "His-maxim-was: "He-who-cannot-dissimulate, cannot-govern" Louis XI-did-not-shy-away from-crime and-on-more-than-one-occasion he-disposed-of-those- he-had-imprisoned, in-iron-cages, wearing-heavy-chains that-were-known-as The King's-Little-Girls" Stop, Andre', time's up. You've worked very well today. Close the ink pot. You still read a little hesitantly, but you've improved. Good, very good. However, you need to learn to concentrate. You'll see it's a matter of habit. It will get a lot easier. Tomorrow, we'll read on and do a few sums. You?re leaving, Monsieur Gu?ret? I thought you might stay a little longer today, since you cut yesterday's lesson short. But, Madame... I wanted to see if Andre' is working well. Just carry on as if I weren't here! What shall I do? Reopen the book. And read. "In-one-of-these-cages he-had-his-minister-incarcerated : Cardinal-La-Balue." - Very good, Andre'. Shut the book and tell me what you've retained. Retained...! Don?t be afraid. I'm only asking you to tell me what you've just read. Who's it about? King" Louis... XI. See, you do know. And what did King Louis XI do? He locked little girls in cages. Andre, These little girls were... ...chains. Who did he put in a cage? I don't know. You've just read it. Think. I can't, I can't. Andre, I shall have to punish you. Monsieur Gu?ret! Madame, I am sorry. Monsieur Gu?ret, I am thinking of sending my son to school next year. Will he be able to follow secondary or primary level? Oh, secondary school, with some months' sustained effort. With several month's solid work. Then we agree Monsieur Gu?ret. 4 or 5 months of diligent study. Yes Madame. With a tutor makes his pupil understand, what he is studying. Do we still think the same, Monsieur Gu?ret? Certainly... Madame. A tutor who doesn't tell his pupil confusing, sinister stories. This is the History of France, I did not invent it. You may expect my visits to be frequent, Mr Gu?ret Andre, come here. I shall punish you. Monsieur Gu?ret Sit down. I have the impression you do not like my son. Madame? Don't deny it. I think it natural for tutors to dislike their pupils. But don't punish him; I'll take care of that. Forgive me, you do rely in part on these lessons for... well, to live? I work as a tutor, yes Madame. Tutor, hum. There's no shortage of tutors, you know. Do not rely too much on me. Madame, I 'm sorry if I've upset you Upset? Why upset? Do you like giving lessons while l am here? It's not that I like it I'm interested. I'm interested, too. We're getting to know one another. Admit it, you were ill at easy today, weren't you? You suffered. Yes you did! My presence is...unpleasant? Madame, I'd never dare... Of course not. But it's true nevertheless. I'd never dare! How many times have I had to hear those words! Men are cowards, that's the truth. All men, wouldn't you agree? See you tomorrow, monsieur Gu?ret. I shan't keep you. Good evening! Good evening, Monsieur Gu?ret. Good evening. Are you not going upstairs? No! And your coffee? No, thanks. Alright, out with it! I 've got something to tell you, but not here. "Why not? I can't talk to you here. How fussy you are! I want to see you alone, This evening! I'm busy tonight. Tomorrow then, please! What's wrong with you? Please! Very well... The footbridge, then, around 6 o'clock. At 6. I said around 6. Good evening! Do you wish to dine? They're late this evening. Right! Good evening, Monsieur Borges! Good evening Madame Londe. Good evening, sir. Lucienne, serve the soup, then they'll come. Lucienne, come in here. Good evening Monsieur Treps. Good evening, Madame Londe.

Good evening, Madame. Good evening, Monsieur Pinsot. Good evening, Monsieur Goncelin. Ah, good evening, Monsieur Leon. Good evening, Monsieur Pariset. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10... Good evening, Monsieur Palisson. I bet Monsieur treps went to Champrimont. To buy himself a new hat. It would be hard to hide anything from you, Madame Londe! Lucienne! Go ask the guest at the end if he wants his place kept. And be friendly! How stupid! What did he say? He said he'd wait till after the meal to decide. Of course he's right to wait till after the meal to decide! Did I tell you to go ask him about it now? Go back to the kitchen! Monsieur? Are you looking for someone? I?d like to pay. Since you're coming back, I'll put your account down I don't know if I shall come back. The rule is that a regular customer doesn't pay his first meal Monsieur will not refuse me this pleasure? Will Monsieur be good enough to sign here... But I don't know when I'll be able to some back... It's enough to know that Monsieur will some back some day or other. Thank you. See you soon, Monsieur Gu?ret! Is that you? Yes ! Have you had dinner? Yes, I have. Aren't you going to ask me what I've done today? What have you done? The boss kept me for 2 extra hours to finish the mail. Have you had your pay this month? Good. What about you? Yes, I got paid for the weekly lessons. When are you going to ask for a rise? A rise? After just 3 weeks? But it's more than that, we arrived in October We won't have enough money this winter. You ought to have asked for more to start with! It's too late to ask for more. Too late and too soon. As you wish. Don't be upset, we'll manage. I'm not upset. You're imagining all sort of things. No, leave me alone. I had a lot of work today. Please fasten the shutters? Why are you following me? I told you at the footbridge! I was afraid you wouldn't come! People could know you followed me! Let me go first. You?re impossible! I agreed to meet you over there, on the bridge! I didn't think you'd wait, so I ran. Don't you see I'm in love with you? What do I have to do to please you? How should I know? it's your job to find out. I was going to invite you to dinner. You and me, dinner? No. "Why not? I can't. But you don't have dinner in that restaurant. I went in behind you and you weren't there. Where were you? Leave it, it's late. If you've got something to say, say it and let me go home. I hope you're not afraid of me. You do ask some funny questions. I've got something for you. "A ring? It's pretty. Let me put it on your finger. If you want. That hurts. You're a funny one. It could all have been so simple. Do you think we could be happy? See you soon. What are you looking at? People going past. That's interesting, is it? I can see them and they don't know. It's funny. Well! You're growing into a woman. You're not cold, are you? No, Madame Londe. Don't call me that anymore. What should I call you, then? Aunt Augusta. Like Ang?le? Yes, like Ang?le. Turn towards me a bit. Just yesterday someone made a compliment about you. A compliment? Who? Someone. It's true: you're not badlooking. Don't imagine you're a great beauty. Let's say that you look better than a year back. You don't do your hair properly. Go get my comb, my brush and the hand mirror. I don't want people telling me that you're a pretty little girl. I don't want pretty little girls in the house. Come over here. Don't move. Drop your head forward a bit. Just a bit! See how different you look! Look at that. Stand up, turn round! Well, even I am surprised! Do you think I look better? You're not a little girl anymore. Not a little girl anymore. Not a little girl, not a little girl, not a... Fernande, what are these stupid faces about? Go away! Give a girl a mirror and she'll go all silly on you... Am I disturbing you, Aunt Augusta? Not at all! Good to see you. Have you thought about Monsieur Blondeau? I'm still not sure. Still? He's been hassling me for 3 days now! And you can be sure he'll ask me again this evening. What shall I look like? I know. But you must answer When he last went out with you, you said he was very kind. Oh! I want to talk to you about the new customer, Monsieur Gu?ret! What's the matter? Nothing. Monsieur Gu?ret was here yesterday and he'll be back! I thought of you, of course. Of me? Yes, of course you! What is so extraordinary? He's a fine gentleman. Next time he comes in, you could come and talk to me, at the beginning of the meal, just so he can see you. There's a few things I want to know, he doesn't confide in anyone. I could only find out he was married. Good grief, quarter to seven! I shall have to change or I'll be late at the restaurant. Now, as for Monsieur Blondeau, I've got one more question: Do you think he's really wealthy? No idea! I've told you everything I know! Well you'll have to find out, my dear! I promised him you'd go out with him on Sunday. I shan't go out with Monsieur Blondeau. Well, go with Monsieur Gu?ret then. I don't care who it is: I shan?t go out at all! Well, Without wishing to be inquisitive: what are you going to live on? Who will pay the rent? Rent? I've got a room here. What if I told you to leave tonight? I'd leave ! You'd leave? Are you mad? What about my restaurant? I can't stay here any more! Calm down, calm down! I'll go tonight. Where would you go? I'm the only family you've got! I brought you up! Let go... I want to leave. What is this ring? I should have known you were hiding something. Who? It's my business. Let me past. Are you happy to see me? The way you're looking at me... Don't you have anything to say? Yes, I'm looking at you. I could look at you for hours. Are you that keen on me? In a minute, when I'm alone, I shall be so unhappy. Let's not think about that! You're nice to me, but you're nice to everyone. It's not the same with you. I don't want your hand if it doesn't mean anything. I agree to see you and this is how you thank me? Ang?le ... No! Let me go! What do you give other men? Is 5 minutes of chat on a road enough for them? Who are "the others"? The ones who aren't like lam. If that's how it is, I'm off! Fine, off you go then! it's better like that! Lord, I'm afraid. Don't let anything bad happen! I'd like to see that man again. I can't help thinking about him. There you are, Monsieur Gu?ret. Andre"s still outside, Madame has gone to bed. Please wait in the drawing room Come this way, my dear Monsieur Gu?ret Since my wife is ill, we shall have the opportunity to sit together a while before the boy gets back. Do take off your mackintosh. There you go. This way! Welcome to my refuge. Make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Can I offer you something to drink? A whisky? No, thank you. I don't drink. You don't have any vices? I do. You might find me... ...somewhat inquisitive. What are you doing here? Between us, one would die of boredom. I heard that you lived in Paris before coming to Larges. Leaving Paris for the provinces! How strange. Was it financial difficulties that forced you to leave? Yes...yes... Of course And now you want to set yourself up as a teacher here in the region? But tell me: you must get bored here, after Paris? Well, sometimes time does pass slowly... That's because you're missing something. At your age, I wasn't bored! She's pretty, isn't she? Just look at her back... her arms... her shoulders... I bet you missed the portrait in the hall? Come with me, you'll like this. You can't see a thing here! Wait, let me turn on the light. It's Madame Grosgeorges! Indeed! 15 years ago. That really was her. Yes, it's a lovely painting... Are you interested in painting? I am, passionately, but none of this modern nonsense! I could do the same, one hand tied behind my back. No, I'm biking about the greats! Bonnet, Cronninck, Gremon Cocquillard... They were true painters! Look at the skin, how well it's rendered! Pearly white! And the mouth? Have you seen this drawing? it's a SalvetLagrance. It didn't come cheap. I'll switch off the light. I've seen enough of her! I can't even stand seeing a picture of hen I'm going to say something that might shock you, but it's for your own good. The other day near the station, I saw a woman wearing black, quite tall; I won't describe her, I was told that she was Mrs Gu?ret. But... Why are you telling me this? Because you're so bloody unhappy and it shows! Perhaps you think I don't understand you. Well, think of this way." you know my wife, and you've just seen her portrait. 15 years' difference. 15 years is a long time. I t was wonderful at first, but then." just boring. There 's a guff between us. first of all, she's foreign, which doesn't help. It didn't take long for me to start looking elsewhere. No w, if you 're interested, I know a young one, 18 years old, The complexion they have at that age, the cheek, bloody gorgeous, a little gift now and then to keep the flame alive, eh? In other words, she works wonders! Wonders! Eva, you're "P! Well! Now you're here, I'm off. Sit down, monsieur Gu?ret. Sit down! I shan't be sorry to speak to you alone. And Andr?...? Andr?, won't have his lesson today, but you'll be payed. My husband has spoken to you about what he calls his "dalliances"? He only refered to... Wonders! Yes. I heard. If you think that it isn't common knowledge... If you only knew how... how little I care. Do you know the girl? Yes, of course you do. No, Madame. I'm not asking you to confide in me, but I shall tell you who my husband's conquest is. A prostitute! This "wondrous" girl is a prostitute. I know that she works at the laundry. The laundry! It is a front, and everyone knows about it. You do too! Madame, I wasn't aware. You were! I can see it on your face. What I've just said upsets you, doesn't it? You're taken with this "wonder"! You have gone pale! Do you feel unwell, Monsieur Gu?ret? Don't tell me you too... Oh! Oh! That really would be the height of hilarity. Whats the matter with you all? Madame, if that's all... I do have something else to tell you. I shall tell you about her. She's 18 years old. You are upset Mr Gu?ret, how interesting. You're mistaken, I don't know the person you're talking about. Oh my, you do lie poorly! But I admire you for tying! However, I'm going to upset you a little more, just a little bit, just so you know that ifs her. I'm going to tell you her name. Look me in the eyes: Ang?le. Come on, tell us what it was like! Well, we went out. I assume you noticed it? What? The beauty spot on her neck? You know the spot, everyone does! Don't think Mrs Londe will lend you the room upstairs Who is it? Ang?le, is that you? Are you back, Ang?le? Ang?le? Help! Help! Stop him! Help! Help! Help! Help! Where are you going? What's wrong? Where did you spend the night? They lent me a room at the laundry. So ifs you who broke in during the night? Minim. hi. Who were you with? Let my arm go, people can see us! Where did you the spend the night? At the laundry! That's a lie! Who were you with? Don't shout! People are looking at us! Just tell me who you were with. Nobody! It was Grosgeorges, wasn't it? Or was it Blondeau, tell me! Let me go! Look, people are approaching us. If you don't want people to see us, let's go down to the water. If you shout, I'll throw us into the water, and we'll drown. Shout? Why? Tell me you don't love me! Tell me! Would I have followed you? You don't understand! You're saying that because you're afraid. I've left Madame Londe for you! You're lying! Who were you with? Nobody! Confess! Confess! Let me go! Shut up. Let go! Shut up or I'll kill you. Shut up. Don't try and resist. Ang?le. Ang?le. What have you done? Stop! Stop! Let me past! Gu?ret! Don't be afraid, I'll help you. Who is there? Are you going out? Why would you care? For no particular reason. But I've heard that women are in danger on the roads, and you'd be the only one not to be afraid. Afraid? Have lever been afraid? What should I be afraid of? Of the Monster of Larges. He has raped a girl. Isn't that enough for you? What is more, they still haven't found your son's tutor. Suspicion is becoming fact. The police don't know what to do. Is that so? Well, since you're so clever, how would you go about finding him? I'll wait I know that he will return. Did you know that Mrs Gu?ret has left? Left? Yes, the criminal's lair is empty! Angele refuses to turn him in. Word is, she's hiding him right here! Well, shall we be off? Well, a new hat! Yes, Mrs Londe didn't notice! Mrs Londe is worried. Business is going badly. Mr L?on won't be coming any more. Mrs Londe, Mr L?on won't be coming back. Very well. Ang?le, it's me, Fernanda. You should try and come down. I prefer to stay here. You?re afraid to be seen? Oh, you say so because of my headscarf? Yes, I don't want people to see me. Is what people are saying true? That you still have marks on your face. You were pretty, you know. When will you be able to go outside again? I don't know. I wouldn't dare yet. Why? I don't know what I look like. Can't you look in the mirror? I've been looking so much I can't see myself any more. Fernande, maybe you could tell me how I look. Come over here. I'll take off my scarf, ok? Look. Say something, Fernande! There 's nobody left, Aunt Augusta. I know. Lucienne has left, she's locked up. It's getting late. Good night, Aunt Augusta. Wait. Why are you leaving so fast? Are you afraid? Of course I am, with all that's happened. One poor old sod killed and the whole place goes mad for 6 weeks! Yes, but there was that other thing. Good night, Aunt Augusta. Who is there? Ang?le! Ang?le! Open up! Ang?le! You have to open up! Why are you hiding? The light's in my eyes. Ang?le, I have to talk to you. This evening, downstairs, I got frightened. I could see myself, sitting at my fill, in an empty dining room for the rest of time. Why are you telling me about that? When fear starts flying around a small town like Larges, ifs bad for everyone. Answer me, please, I'm begging you: you know who attacked you, tell me who it was! Speak, before it's too late! Your silence is turning the town against us? Some people are saying you're hiding him. Just tell me if it was Gu?ret. That man is ruining me. He came in and brought a curse with him. I was happy before, I can see that now, everything was running nicely. You were happy yourself, don't deny. You were pretty. I want everything to be as it was before. I don't know what I'd do to that man. You are not saying anything, say something! Leave me alone. Why don't you want to tell me it was Gu?ret? Think about what he did! I don't know who it was! He came from behind. That's what I told the police, and that's all You're lying! And you'll finish us! Do you think I'm mad enough not to say who it was if I knew? If I could just get my hands on him... Get your hands on him? You'd do to him what he did to you! "Go away! 'Stop! I'm not going to turn you in. Come back tomorrow evening at 6. I'll help you. You ? What are you doing here? Oh Madame, you frightened me. Who are you waiting for? My husband, of course, you have come for. You may go back in, Madeleine, I answered myself, thank you. Don't get your hopes up. My husband won't want to see you now, he doesn't want anything more from you. There'll be no more favours now. I came to see you, Madame. .Me? What do you want? To leave, go far away. I am sure that with the necessary amount of money the marks on my face can be made to disappear. If my misfortunes were confined to being hit in the face with a stick, I should have no quarrel with life. Why didn't you say it was Gu?ret down at the waterside? It wasn't Gu?ret. Tell the truth. That's the price for my help. I was afraid of him. Afraid? You were afraid of him? How easy, "afraid of him"! You were after him nonetheless. Well, you had a debt to pay, and you've paid it. And now you're hoping for a clean slate? I used to be as naive as you. Here's my advice: Don't hope for anything. Never hope! Remember: never hope! Ang?le, Be quiet, I won't hurt you. I am risking my life to see you again, don't be afraid. I know you didn't turn me in. Why? Have you forgiven me? Let me leave. I love you, don't you understand? Just tell me that you've forgiven me. Yes, but you have to leave. You want to get rid of me? You're living like you used to? All that's over. If I found the money, would you come with me? How would you get money? Madame Grosgeorges has promised to help me. I'll see to her tonight. Be careful of that woman; I'm afraid of her. Yet she's our last chance. And where would go? Far from here, as far as possible. Yes, far from here, very far. I'll leave with you. You want to come? You really want to come? Kiss me. No! Not now. Not yet. Tomorrow then, we'll meet here, on the footbridge, after dark, at about 6. On the footbridge, after dark, I'll be here. You're not eating. I'm not hungry. Not even after all that exercise? Why doesn't Madelaine go and see what it is? I'll bet the idiot's afraid. Well, what is it? I went to the gate, but there was nobody, Madame. Who was it? Nobody. We've already had a monster, and now the bells are ringing on their own. What are you looking at me for? .Me? If you think you are on my mind, you must be dreaming! Good night! Is that you, Mrs Grosgeorges? Yes. Why weren't you there this evening as arranged? I'll tell you. You were afraid! Now, follow me. Where are you taking me? To my house. I shall give you clothes, if you need money, I'll give you some. You'll leave tomorrow, at noon, while everyone's having lunch. Hide there, I'll come and fetch you later, when everyone in the house is asleep. Gu?ret! Gu?ret! I thought you'd been stupid enough to leave. The light was so bright on the glass, I was afraid I'd be seen, so I hid in the shadow. You are such a coward. What if this had been a trap? Leave. What are you waiting for? You'd better go if you distrust me! I'll stay. Come in, close the door You're above my bedroom here, so don't make too much noise walking about. I'm the only one who comes up here. The maid won't enter unless I say so. You'll sleep there. I'll get you some bedclothes. You are probably hungry? I'll go and get you something. That should keep you warm. Why are you doing all of this for me, Madame Grosgeorges? Do not ever call me Madame Grosgeorges. Eat! I can't. I'm off. Tomorrow morning, I'll order the maid not to do this room. Just don't make any noise I'll be back early in the morning, once everyone's gone down, and I'll bring you some clothes and the money I promised you. Wouldn?t it be wiser for me to leave tonight? You still distrust me. I wouldn't be here if I did. A short while ago, you could have gone. I place myself entirely in your hands. Get some sleep. Don't be afraid of anything. I only wish you well. Ida have a heart. Good day, Madame. Take the tray away, I'll have my breakfast in the dining room. Oh! I forgot, don't do my study this morning. You can have the morning off and do the rooms this afternoon. Stay where you are. I'm going to draw the curtains. Don't go near the windows. You might be seen from the garden. No one will come in here this morning. My orders. You have nothing at all to fear. Sit down there. Now we can make our plans. I hope you aren't worried anymore. I haven't slept a wink, I thought I heard them coming. I had a fever, and then... Somone seemed to be knocking on the door, every minute, all night. That was your heart beating. You really are a coward! Here's the money I promised you, take it. Why are you doing this? That's my business. Now, take this envelope. It's no use thinking of going yet. You must wait until noon. I'll let you leave as soon as my husband goes out. Why doesn't he go out? He has an appointment. But tell me, how have you survived since you left? I don't know. You've never been tempted to steal? No, never. And yet you killed a man! Why shouldn't you have stolen, tun? I would understand, I'd understand everything. Confide in me, I'm not a magistrate! I didn't want to kill that man. And the girl? Don't tell me you didn't almost kill her! I didn't know what I was doing. Nevertheless, you took out your fury on her, by the riven What had you against her? Tell me! Had she turned you down? Wounded your pride? So much hatred just for that? I didn't hate her. I worshiped her. You worship in an odd way. I was jealous: all the men in town were arguing over her, she went from one to the other, and they boasted about it. To get my turn with Ang?le, I... took my wife's money. I wanted Ang?le, no matter the price. I waited for her for a whole night, but I didn't meet her until the morning. I dragged her down to the river, I wanted her, I struck her. Be quiet, I don't want to hear that part! When I was far away, I could only think of her. And now? And now? I'm here because of her. But I thought it was to ask me to help you. 'Help me? I ought to tell you now I've seen Ang?le, She hates you. She is afraid of you, you terrify her! Do you hear me? It's not true. She told me. Anyone there? Fernande? Fernanda? Wait, I'll come down. Fernande... Angele isn't at the laundry anymore, is he? Do you know where she is? Yes, Madame. Well, you can tell Ang?le... No, no, give me a pencil and a sheet of paper instead. There, pass that on to Ang?le, And do it quickly, ifs urgent. What's this note? Leave me, I told you, it's urgent. Give it to me! It's not for you, it's for Ang?le. Now I've got him! Ang?le, I had a note from Madame Grosgeorges for you. Madame Londe took it. Did you read it? Yes. It said: "Gu?ret is hiding here. Tell the police." Madame Londe read that? Then she ran out. Oh God! You told me you came back to Longes for Ang?le, and you think she loves you? Well, at this very moment, your fate is being decided. What have you done? I've thrown the key out of the window. Don't you understand? My husband will be back soon. I'll call him. I'll tell him to get the key and to come and open up. You can guess what will happen. Why did you do that? You had promised your help. Angele knows you're here. If she gets here first, you're saved. You can get her to pick up that little piece of metal gleaming on the gravel. It will set you free. If the police arrive first, it means Ang?le will have called them, and then you'll have proof that she hates you. You've betrayed me. We'll see if Ang?le betrays you. How does she know I'm here? I sent word to her. Why? You'd not want to know. So let me go then! I swear, before they arrest me, you'll be dead. We'll see about that. I'm not afraid of death. What are you doing? You'll understand... Open this door now or I'll kill you! Killing me will help you a lot, because once dead, I won't be able to help at all. I'm begging you, let me go. I should have known that this was a trap. You just want to see suffering. If your son's head was being cut off you wouldn't turn a hair! I'd like to see you dead! You're not a woman, you're a monster! You fool! You just don't understand! Get out! Get out! Where are you? Get out of there! Madame Londe has told the police! Get out of there, for me! Look for the key on the pathway! The key! Finish me off! I don't want to live anymore. What's going on? Quickly, get out, they're here! The key on the pathway! What? What are you doing here? What have you done now? A shot was fired? Come here, you little trollop! On the footbridge! I'll wait for you. Yes Ang?le, on the footbridge! "Hurry! He's up there! It's you, my love. I was sure you would come. They can't hurt us now. It's over, my love. My love.
