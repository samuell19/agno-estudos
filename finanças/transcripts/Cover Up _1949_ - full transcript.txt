Jerome Sam you sure stirred up a mess of trouble but you didn't letme down you're quite a detective you know it was doc- yes I've known dr. all my life I probably noticed he was left-handed and then maybe it helped knowing that he was the last man to see Phillips alive of courseSam here worked it out the hard way how did you knowhe was the last one to see him alivewell Samyou forget I was herewhenMargaret and Frank left I leftmyself shortly after and as I was pulling away II saw doc going in I supposeI shouldhave come to you right away Larryyes youshould us to what I guess it would have turned out the same anyway you mean you were both covering for sure Ohlookslike it but why I told you once Sam I wish you had known dr.
