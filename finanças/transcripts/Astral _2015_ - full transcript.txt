Subtitles by explosiveskull Hi, Claire. How you feeling today? I'm feeling better than yesterday. That's good. You manage to get any sleep this time? I did actually. Brilliant. Right, I'll come back later and we'll have a little chat. Is he a baby? Is he quite young? He said to continue taking them. - Claire? - Sorry? He said you have to make sure you keep taking them, OK? Joel, I'm fine. Please, just for the first few weeks, OK? OK, I will. We live in a multi-dimensional world. Each organism dependent on its individual level of consciousness apprehends a dimension of space extracted from time. Yes, Ben. So, the assumption is, we have to separate ourselves from the... lesser dimensions of other organisms? Not quite. Our world encompasses theirs, although they are unable to apprehend our wider reality. Take the simple consciousness of an organism, like a snail, for example. They're unaware of the past or the future, living only in the present. Driven merely by sensation. What about the dog? They're conscious of the past? Remembering where they buried a bone. Yes, good. By virtue of their higher mental faculty and simple consciousness, a dog can mentally extract from time another dimension of space and so it lives in a world larger than that of the snails. And us? We humans with self-consciousness live in a world of three dimensions, of space plus time. Perhaps, there is a larger world still that includes ours as ours includes the others and so it continues. So, we live in a world unaware of a broader existence? Exactly. We live in a multi-dimensional universe but are conscious of ourselves only in a three-dimensional world. We live in a real physical world but perhaps we don't know it nearly as well as we think. In fact, we may scarcely know it at all. It has been said throughout time that man has sought to enter this astral dimension by means of expanding his consciousness be it through an out-of-body experience or meditation, or the use of psychoactive substances. So, this week's assignment - "Is there still a higher realm, one that we cannot yet comprehend?" A thousand word minimum, please. Collect them from Corina as you make your way out. Thank you. So, you're saying... with increased awareness we can actually see into this astral world? There's a lot of research to support it, yes. Seems a bit far-fetched. I don't know, I think the idea of another dimension we can't see seems feasible. It's more than feasible. There's plenty of esoteric literature on it. What if we could access it, like find a way into that world? There is a theory called astral projection. Through it, it's thought you can detach your spirit from your physical body and enter into another plane of existence. But it's a pretty out-there theory. Perhaps you would each be best focusing your attention on actual science. Do you think it's actually possible then? Theoretically, yes. Thank you, Corine. There are examples of clairvoyance, using it to contact the dead but I guess that's where it gets a little more... abstract. Really? Well, like any discipline it requires training or at least some basic knowledge. Well, perhaps the science of it would be a good place to start your research for this week then? But I'll leave that to each of you. - See you all next week. - Gareth? Your coffee. Thank you, Miss Richardson. Thanks for adding more work, Alex. So, have you read about this then, Lys? - Astral projection? - Yeah. I stumbled across a little on YouTube. You know people that claim to astral project, they experience exactly the same sensations as someone, as a jet pilot suffering from G-LOC. You can't be that narrow-minded? The mind's a powerful thing. I'm sure with a few cognitive tricks anyone could be entertained by the darkest corners of their subconscious. Besides, if you wanna believe everything you see on YouTube why stop at astral projection? I'm pretty sure there are literally pages dedicated to proving that ghosts and mermaids and boogeymen are real. You can chase the Mad Hatter, I'm sticking with psychoactive substances for my research. I wasn't sitting there watching it all night. Aww, so what else caught your attention? Whatever it was, it won't be as disgusting as the filth you undoubtedly watch. So, you DO spy on me? Never thought I'd see the day I'd find you in here late. Yeah, that makes two of us. Interesting collection. What's it for? Bit in depth, aren't they? Well, I guess if we don't challenge ourselves now, we never will. Glad to see you're finally taking it seriously. Psst! Hey, Alex. You ready? That's my cue. Erm... The sun sets late tonight, do you... wanna come and hang with us at the Quad? Er, no... I just wanna get this finished, but you go. OK. I'll see you tomorrow then, I guess. Goodnight. Night. OK. I haven't even seen the first. Ahh, the sequel's better, anyway. - You're up early. - Yeah, I know. Got an early night, tried that astral projection thing. Useless. - There's a surprise. - Yeah. Absolutely nothing. Bloody useless. Told you. Wouldn't trust anything she says, she'll have you looking for Big Foot next. I don't know. I don't think you should be messing around with that. Doesn't matter. I don't think I was doing it right anyway. I was so tired, I just sort of fell asleep. How were you tired? All you ever seem to do is sleep? Well, the library session took its toll. You read about it and still couldn't figure it out. Sounds about right. Oh, so that's what the books are about. Yeah, yeah. Quite interested, though. Just thought I'd give it a go. Interest? It's more like obsession, seeing as you don't even research for classes. Well, whatever it is, I'm clearly useless at it. Oh, well, when in Rome. Yeah? Do as the Romans did. OK? When you're in Rome you talk to Caesar. Yeah, you're retarded, man. Professor Powell, dumb arse. He's the one who suggested it. Despite the awful misuse of that analogy, that's actually not a bad idea. I'm... full of good ideas. Obviously. Mr Harmann, what can I do for you? I've been doing some reading on astral projections. And I was just wondering if, maybe, you could help me to understand it a bit better? If you have time. Well, OK, what exactly did you want to know? Well, I was thinking about attempting it... But I want to know... Dunno, I just want to know more about it first. Have you tried YouTube? Actually, I did try YouTube. Yes, that was interesting, to say the least. But I dunno... I just dunno where to start. Right. Where'd you get your reading material? So, I spent a few hours in the library last night, just going through some reference books. Oh, yeah, they're a good place to start but the majority are probably... outdated. I've been asking the university to reinvest in more material but... Apparently, funding's limited for the pseudo-sciences. Can I ask why exactly you want to try it? To be honest, it's something I think you should be careful with. Besides, the university aren't exactly advocates for that sort of thing. Well, it's just that since we've working on consciousness, I just want a more practical understanding of our spirits. Wow. That's how I started on this journey. It's a passion for growth. I'm far from versed in it, but I have tried it, although that was a long time ago. - Really? - I was fascinated with it. It's a wonderful tool but we need to learn a lot more about it. It's not an exact science. The idea of astral travel is rooted in most worldwide religious accounts of the afterlife, where they describe the soul's journey as an out-of-body experience. The idea is that the spiritual traveller leaves their physical body and travels in their astral body... through higher realms. So, when people say they've seen a ghost, that's just like a glimpse into another parallel reality? Sort of, but it's more complicated than that. Things like UFOs, abductions, psychic phenomenon, can't simply happen in the three-dimensional world that we know, and yet they do, right? So, those that don't understand are quick to label them as paranormal, but normality is just an individual's interpretation of reality. So, astral projection allows you to contact spirits who aren't in our world? Amongst other things, possibly. You don't think so? I never came into contact with any myself but I certainly wouldn't rule out the possibility. I did read a great book about religious spirituality and our ability to connect with it. The author actually used to lecture here. But budget cuts relieved her too. - What was her name? - Michelle Collins. It's definitely the sort of thing I think you're looking for. But with your attempts, I can't really tell you how to do it. I can only describe how I did it. And that's not to say it would even work for you. No, of course. But just any help would be great. I need a decent house party tonight. You lads up for it? I'm up for it. - You? - Sure. - Are we keeping you from something? - Just emails. Yeah, that doesn't... - How about you two? - How about us two what? - House party tonight. - Without a doubt. I'm in. Alex, are you going? Erm, sorry, I don't think I'm going to be able to make it tonight but I'll talk to you later, OK? - What's up with him? - Maybe... found himself a girl. Well, I'm definitely up for tonight. - Good. It's a date then. - You wish. Right. Yeah. No, I don't care but this is because of what you did. You had an opportunity to say something and you never did. Right, but you've only started with all of this now in an attempt to fix things. Look, Dad. OK, OK. OK! Look, alright, you've said your piece. No, I never said it was your fault! But listen you're supposed to be the one person I can come to about everything, and the fact that you've hidden it from me for so long is what hurts the most. No, no, it's simple. She's dead. Yeah, and you've left me to deal with that on my own. No, that choice was yours. You know what, I'm done. 21 seems a bit late for all this, Dad. It adds a lot of questions. A lot of questions. You know maybe I'd have understood how you felt but it just feels like you've left me out of everything. You were so young. I didn't know when to tell you. You can't... You can't do this. Not now. Look, Alex... No, no, you waited way too long for this. You can't do this to me now because you're only doing it to try and fix things. I thought things were getting better. - You alright, girl? - Yeah, can I just get through? Please? Thanks. Sorry. Hey, Alex, it's Alyssa. I know you weren't planning on coming to the party tonight but... Well, I just wanted to see if you changed your mind? Call me when you get a chance. This is all I really have to give you. You wanna do this? The first thing you need to do is find somewhere comfortable. But you don't want to be tired. You need to lay on your back and rest your eyes. You will get urges to move, ignore them. Concentrate on your breathing. You are tricking the brain to think that the body is dreaming. This activates body paralysis, a transitional state between wakefulness and sleep. But when this happens you can separate from your paralysed physical body. And undertaking this I, I always choose to consider the following verses. I am at total peace. I am connected to all that exists. I am empowered to travel wherever I wish to go. I will be protected mentally, physically and spiritually. Hello. Sorry, I ended up crashing early again. Just getting up now. I've got some news. I'll see ya in a bit. No, no, you guys probably won't believe me, anyway. OK, bye. Hey, I did it. I swear. I could actually see myself out of body. Please, don't tell me you're still going on at this astral thing? Well, there's no need to go on about it because I've perfected it. I'm a genuine projectionist. You can't perfect something in a night. Film it. See if you could actually move something in a room. You can't move things. I mean, your physical body vibrates at a different density to your astral body, so you can't affect things from the astral world. Then how is it that a poltergeist can move stuff then? They're not physical? A poltergeist is a just a subconscious extension of someone present in the room. They show the same physical characteristics as that person but do it in an unseen dimension. Although they operate in the same space, your astral body is immaterial and can't have any effect on physical matter. I thought you only knew a little bit about it. Wow. Am I the only sane one here? OK, Let's assume for a moment that there's actually something to this. Why not find a way to prove it? How? A spirit's an energy source, right? OK, then why not use something designed to detect energy. Like a... like a weighted pendulum? - What's that? - It's essentially a body of mass, suspended by a piece of string designed to detect resistance. You could use a silk wire, it'll heighten sensitivity and given a little bit of energy and it will swing. Actually, that might work. All you've have to do is touch the pendulum during an astral projection. Yes! Right, I may know a trick to recording it on your webcam. I could help you set it up although I expect my cut once it goes viral. Say... 70%? 69? Is that the pendulum thing? Yeah, I looked it up online they gave like a basic idea of the design and then I just borrowed a couple of things from the science department. Looks legit. Alright I set the laptop up to record though its own webcam, so literally just click on it when you want to start but make sure you turn it off when you're done. Shit eats space. Break a leg. I'm just saying he's been really distant lately. I honestly think you're reading way too much into this. I just wanna make sure he's alright. Why don't you just tell him how you feel? Yeah, great idea. How about this? Hey, Alex, you going to class? Oh, by the way, I'm secretly harbouring feelings for you It's a start. No. He's got his own problems, anyway. Like? Just this argument I overheard. He was having it with his dad. About what? Just their relationship, I think. I've never seen him get so upset before. He didn't even know he lost his mum. How long were you standing there for? Long enough. Hey, maybe that's what his obsession is with this astral stuff. - Really? - Yeah, Professor Powell did say that people actually use it to contact spirits. Maybe he's just genuinely interested in it. Please, it's reading. When has he ever been interested in that. Oh! Ever since he's started with this damn astral stuff he's been acting so weird. He barely even texts me back anymore. Mentally, physically, spiritually. Just remember the camera was on. Some things are impossible to unsee. Just play it. Yeah, go forward. - That's it. Stop. - Where? That. Go back. Stop. Play it from there. Watch. That's all it does? - Sure there wasn't a draft? - No, I shut the window. Bit early for you guys, isn't it? You wanted proof? Jordan helped me to record it last night. Just looked through the footage. The pendulum moved. - Have a look. - Let's see it then. That's it? Wow. That's... definitely worth the wait, thanks, Alex. Bit of a stretch to call it proof though. No, the pendulum moved. That's ridiculous. Then it doesn't matter what I do. Oi, I swear, I was outside of my body looking down at myself. I got up. I walked past the pendulum. I stuck my arm out to move it. Then... There. More proof. I only pushed it once. Wait, this was later. I was asleep. Look, I was rolling around, the pendulum shouldn't have moved. Maybe there was a draft? That's what Jordan said, but I shut the window, plus that would debunk the first time. Astral attempt number two. The time now is 10:46. Hey. D'you see what I mean? It's weird, right? - Yeah. - So, that must be me? Nah, doesn't make any sense. - Surely you can't record your own spirit? - Well, what else could it be? You alright? You're in late. Yeah, I had a few things to take care of. I'm gonna go to bed. Night. Night. - I'm going to bed. - And? - Night. - Dickhead. What happened to you? It's stupid, I fell off that damn chair this morning putting something away. It's your bloody fault I thought it was the only one there. I wasn't here this morning I had an early lecture. That's weird. What is? I could swear last night I saw something standing in the living area when I went to turn the lights out. Really? Like what? I don't know. I mean, it looked like a person but when I went to turn the lights back on. There was nothing there. That's it. It's ghosts. It's the only plausible explanation. No, Ben. I'm telling you something was there. Why are you two talking in the dark? Yes, please, send him through. - Dr Leafler. - Hello, Alex. Please, call me, James. Have a seat. Thanks for seeing me. I really wasn't sure what to make of your call. I understand from your emails that you've experienced a shadow person. Yeah. Well, it's, a little more than a singular experience. I mean I woke up, the other evening, last night, just in the middle of the night... So it felt like a dream. But it was so real, I keep seeing things. And now even my flatmates, they're seeing things to. I have to be completely honest with you, I don't usually meet with people this quickly. Why am I different? In a word. That pendant. - This? - Yes, I've only seen one like it before. Coupled with your name. Perhaps I should explain fully. I've spent years trying to better understand the shadow people. I trained some years ago and the basis of my psychological training was at a facility in Kent. I'd been assigned a patient who had been exhibiting signs of psychosis. I believe that patient was your mother. So you... you treated my mother? You're the reason she came home. You're the reason she was released early. Alex, please understand, Your mother's condition was coupled with these visions. This is unlike anything we'd seen before. This is a joke. I mean... It's got to be a joke. What you expect me to take advice from you? Given what you've put my family through. How dare you. Sorry, what... What exactly is it you want from me? Another experiment? Some remorse for what you did? I understand much more now than I did back then, please know that. I recognise that you're upset but I maybe the only person who can help you now. I believe this is only going to get worse. Alex! - Lyssa? - Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? I was wondering if we could have a chat? Yeah, yeah, come in. What are you doing? Nothing. I just thought I heard something outside. Really? Sorry. Just some weird things have been happening. Like what? I've... been seeing things. Anyway. Erm... Yes... What do you want to talk about? Erm... I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now. Err... Yeah? About? Alex... I like you. And that I don't... Sorry, I've been useless. I've had so much on my mind, I feel like I'm going crazy. You're a big part of my life and I love having you as a friend and I don't want to lose that, I guess, that just kind of - scares me. - But that's not gonna happen. We have and always will be friends. - I hope not... - Let's just see what happens. It's new. We'll just see where it goes and then if it becomes uncomfortable or anything, we'll just go back to being friends. What the hell? OK, this is gonna sound crazy, OK? But I swear... there is something in this room. What? There's something in this room, There's something in this room. Yes. Thank you, please do. Hello, Alex. I'm so glad you came back. Please, sit down. I need to apologise about yesterday, it just came as a shock But I understand that you couldn't have known what would happen. Thank you, Alex. I'm sorry for your loss. Hmm. This is very new to me. My father only just told me about everything. I understand. Yeah. Look, I have to be honest. OK, I wouldn't have come back by choice. It's just that things are getting worse. And I don't know what to do. Did something happen? I'm just seeing these shadows more and more often. It's a plague and it's affecting those around me. And then yesterday I saw something different. Different? - Look, I'm not crazy. - What do you mean different? Well, it was just a different shape from the others. It was like a human but with the head of a ram. Alex, if this is spiritual... then I'm afraid there isn't much more I can do for you. - No, no, you said! You said! - I know what I said. I know what I said but things are more complicated now. Listen, I need to do something. There's nothing I'd be able to do. I don't know enough about it. OK, well, what the hell do I do? You need to find someone who understands this. As a professional I've always remained sceptical, but it would seem these shadow people have something of an historical occurrence. I guess your attempt at astral projection may have opened a gateway that was perhaps otherwise, meant to stay shut. He said there was nothing he could do. What the hell do I do now? Well, is there nothing we can do? What about clairvoyance? How is that gonna help? Well, maybe if I can figure out what it is. I'll know how to get rid of it. So, which if you would like to go first? Me, I'd like to, please. First off, if you could shuffle the cards in any way you wish. Place the pack face down on the table. Now, if you could cut the pack at any point you wish. I'm now going to lift three cards, which will be relevant only to you. I will explain the meaning on each one as they turn and their relationship to each other. The Hanged Man. This card signifies change, sacrifice and abandonment. It's about letting go of your past to reveal a new spiritual beginning. The Tower. This card reveals a sudden change coming. Abandonment of the past and unexpected events. You brought something here with you. Michelle, your book, it stated a section on banishing spirits with a case study. I wish I'd never written it. That case study is the reason I don't do it anymore. I need your help. Please, leave. Let's just go. Thank you for your time. Let's go, Alex. Trust me. That was not me. I need you to sit down. I've never done a reading like this before. These cards represent a very dark change in your life. There are spirits around you looking for a way in. You saw them? Yes, and our only choice is to banish them. There is one, more powerful than the others. It seeks only destruction, it won't stop till it gets what it wants. - We need its name. - Why? Most religions have names for them. The Bible refers to them as demons, spirits, and fallen angels, although I use the term loosely. We need to find its name to understand its weaknesses. This can't be. You can't affect things from the astral realm. You attempted astral projection? Yeah, I only wanted to look into that world to find my mum. Alex, your mother is not here now. But something else is. It's looking to break you down and it's getting stronger and more powerful. It's feeding on your fear. Stay here. The Quran refer to these spirits as Jinn, a spirit from an unseen dimension. Alex, you'll have to do as you did before. Project? - Yes. - No. No, no, no, no, no. No, that's what started this. - It's gonna make it worse. - No, it won't. No, I can't. I... Alex, please trust me. It won't make it worse. - No. - Alex, listen to me. Its power... Please, listen to me. Its power... I can't, I can't. Its power is that it can affect this world. But it is not stronger than you in its world. You have to cross over and demand its name. With that we can cast it out. So, we're supposed to just sit here and watch? Yes, but we can combine our energies. Alex? Right. Alex? I need you... to stare into the candle. It's OK. Stare into the candle. Consider your thoughts. And focus your energy... ..into the flame. The light of God surrounds us, the love of God enfolds us. May the presence of God watch over us. The power of God protects us. Wherever we are, God is, and all is well. Let's begin. Don't believe everything you're about to see. Follow my lead. And focus yourself on positive thoughts. Place your finger on the planchet. We acknowledge your presence. Tell us your name. Alex. Demand its name. Alex! It's alright. I demand you... Give us your name! A. Amaymon. What is it? It's not possible, it can't... - What the hell is it? - It's not just a spirit... Alex, end your projection! Art thou, Asmodai? - Your face. - Don't believe it. These are tricks of the mind. Alex. Return your dark spirit to the depths from which you came! Counter all negative thoughts and actions that are being directed to us. Eliminate the enemy's power to do any evil to us. In Jesus Christ's name, I pray he lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Alex, come back. Alex, you OK? Dad. - Alex. - Erm. There's someone I want you to meet. Hello, Mr Harmann. - I'm Alyssa. - Please, call me, Joel. It's a pleasure to meet you. Come in. Wow. That's very good. Aww. Daddy. Perfect likeness. It's pretty good. You, OK?
