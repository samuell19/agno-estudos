THE SEARCH (The Jet Set) Your Martini, Sir. You have it, I'll take a dive. Fix another one for me. Too hot. 37Â°C in the shade. What's new today? A new tanker shipwreck in the Indian Ocean. In Italy a centre goverment. Hijack in Canada. Anything original? Unfortunately not. What's the time? Five to four. Very well, you may go. Thank you. - Mr. Vergis? - Yes. - Marisa. - Come in. It's really nice here. I'd love to come again. Yes? London? No, please cancel the invitation. Perhaps later. Yes, thank you. - May I? - Please. Who's staying in the cabana next door? One's rented, the other two are vacant. I know that, I asked who's staying there. Mr. Vergis Jr, his father died last year. And what is he? The largest tip in this place, ever. - What does he do? - Nothing. Oil tankers, shipyards, refineries... That's all I know, anyway. This is Mr. Vergis's private secretary, yes please? Who's calling? Please, hold the line. Yes? Spyrou's on the phone. Right away. Yes, Spyrou, just a minute. Yes, go on. 483 Souniou Avenue. 4,5 kms past Lagonisi. Ground floor. Why ground floor, is it a block of flats? No, I didn't consider it necessary. Yes, I'll check immediately. You can count on me. Your bathrobe, Sir. Your refreshment, Sir. Ah, merci. Your barber's here, Sir. - Get a haircut yourself. - But I've already got one. So what? Get another one. - Excuse me. - Yes? Are you here for Mr. Vergis? And who might you be? His secretary. This is for you. Something unexpected came up and he won't manage to see you. Pity. Tomorrow, then. He'll call for you. Your name? Jenny. Good bye. - Mr. Vergis? - Yes. Jenny. Come in. OK, next. Pardon me? I haven't got much time, you know. You may undress. May I have a drink? There's a small bar to your right. Fully equipped. You're a little nervous or am I mistaken? Perhaps. How many years of experience do you have? - Why's that important? - Done any other jobs? Mannequin, fashion model... - I must have missed you. - I wasn't working here. - But? - In London. And you changed your line of work? As you see... The reason? I earn more. As I said, I haven't got much time. If you've finished your drink, stand over there and strip. There's too much light in here. It can't get any darker. - Mr. Vergis? - Yes. - Marisa. - Come in. - Jenny? - Yes? Come back same time tomorrow. You know? This is something I don't say often. Sorry. What do you mean? Do not expect me. I never visit anybody for a second time. What sort of professional inhibition is this? It's new to me. I try not to get bored. A second time with the same man is always inferior to the first one. Very well, then. Here's your money. Good bye. Yes, Natasha? Listen, that Jenny you sent me today please send her again tomorrow. You haven't eaten anything. More than enough. I've recently gained 2,5 kilos. You're only too careful. - You've taken after me in this. - In this only? Of course not. Besides, this is exactly your mother's complaint. That you've taken after me much and not at all after her. Last week in London she complained that you've abandoned her completely. That what she thinks. I'm going back tomorrow. Will you come with me? She'll be happy to see you. I'd rather stay in Greece a little longer. London gets on my nerves lately. I've noticed. You've been nervous for some time now. Perhaps because you are alone. - I like it. - Yes but for how long? - The longest possible. Don't forget that my CV already includes two idiotic engagements, a ridiculous marriage and a brilliant divorce. Do as you please. How's life in the cabanas for you? Why not settle in here? Either way you'll be alone. I'd rather stay there. Besides, I'm thinking of taking a trip to the islands in a couple of days. A splendid idea. I'd like to follow you but I don't have the time. Want to send a message to your mom? - Kiss her for me. Your martini, Sir. - You can have it. I've had lunch. - Thank you. You said you've had lunch? - Yes, it was inauguration day today. Pity. We have an exquisite lobster. - You can have that, too. By all means. Do you, however, know that all this is bad for me? Why's that? I, who never was a drinker, am in danger of becoming an alcoholic. And from abstinent I'm gradually coming to be a bulimic. Then don't eat. Throw them away. How can I throw such exquisite lobster away? Hello. Hello. So you did come! Should I call and thank Natasha? Natasha? If you think so. I'd like to know if she pressured you or if you changed your mind yourself. She talked to me a lot, anyway. - Or you wouldn't come? - Dunno... Don't you think you should be more flexible in this kind of job? You're not in a hurry today? Is it your intention to get on my nerves? - Perhaps you want me to go? - I didn't say that. I have no time to waste, though, that's for sure. Next. Next, I'll be happy to, but... Won't you lie down first? That's for me to decide. I thought there was a certain procedure. Why are you standing so far away? I'm right where you told me yesterday. I want you to come closer today. Yesterday you had an uneasiness which I liked. Yesterday was the first time. You're right. I shouldn't have told you to come again. I wouldn't mind leaving right now if you want me to. Strange... Although you're the least professional of all girls you're the firmest one, too. And you, although you're best client of all, you're the most cynical one. Such business should come off in the raw. Human relations are trouble, no? I think I set you off into thinking. - Perhaps. - I know more people like you. When they need to think a bit it gets them down. I do a lot of thinking at work. I want these hours to be without any thoughts. Do you know you're unhappy? - You fantasize too much. - Maybe. Come closer. You need a haircut. Yes, tell the barber to come tomorrow. Also your nails need some doing. If it's from the Hilton tell them I'll be leaving in a minute. Hello? Mr. Vergis is about to go out. He is in a hurry. Hold on. The hotel manager wants you. He says it's urgent and strictly personal. Hello, this is Vergis. Mr. Vergis, I'm sorry to be disturbing you. I have 2 police officers in my office who want to see you immediately. In my office tomorrow, please, I'm about to go out now. He asks you to meet him at his office tomorrow. Can I please talk to him myself? Mr. Vergis, you will now speak to one of the gentlemen, please. This is Police Major Alexiou, Crime Scene investigator. Really sorry to be disturbing you but I must see you. Now. Definitely. Then please come immediately. Please, call the Hilton and tell them I'll be about five to ten minutes late. Some gentlemen will be here shortly, please leave us alone. Yes, Sir. - Mr. Vergis? - Yes. This is Police Lieutenant Platis, I've already introduced myself, Police Major Alexiou. - Good, please have a seat. - Can I get you anything? - No, thank you. I'm listening, gentlemen. - Do you know a certain Jenny Karalis? - I don't think so. Don't you know any Jennies? It's a very common name, I wouldn't rule it out. This Jenny Karalis was here yesterday afternoon from 4 to 5. Gentlemen, please be straightforward as to you want from me. We want to know if this Jenny was here yesterday afternoon or not. And why should she be here? A certain Mrs.Natasha has just testified that she was to come here yesterday. Then let's suppose she did come. This is where things get complicated. This Jenny was found killed, Mr. Vergis. Killed? After leaving here, she took the road to Sounio. Her car was found fallen off a cliff. Things would be simple if only... this had been an accident. - But? - There's enough evidence to prove this was a crime. - A crime? - Yes. Before getting killed the victim had been severely beaten in the face. - When did you say this happened? - Yesterday. In that case, gentlemen, we needn't talk about this. No woman came here yesterday. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. The entrance guard told us that yesterday shortly before 4 an orange Volkswagen came through the gate and headed this way. Jenny was driving it. - She told him she was coming to me? - He instructed her how to get here. Strange, no one came here. Naturally, we ought to believe in what you are telling us, Mr. Vergis. But please get in touch with us if you remember anything helpful. Of course. - Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience. - Not at all. Tell me, please, did you tell the police that yesterday at 4 a yellow Volkswagen came through and headed for my cabana? You know, we have been given such orders, Mr. Vergis, when we see strangers' cars, we have to ask where they're going. - Was a girl driving? - Yes, I asked her where she was going. Said she was coming to you. I also gave her the number of your cabana. Then I let her pass. Was it the same girl in the photo the police showed you? Yes, same long dark hair, same dress... But... there's something else, too. What? The girls who come to you stay for a couple of hours. Whereas she left almost immediately. - Did you tell this to the Police? - I forgot to. When I remembered I thought I should ask you first. - Tell them. - Yes, Mr. Vergis. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What do you say, Platis? - Boy, what a life in here! - About Vergis, I mean. - Suspicious behaviour. - Perhaps a disturbed one. - In-between the two. - Are you biased, perhaps? Meaning? Do you perhaps have preconceptions thinking of Vergis's millions? He's involved anyway. Remember what this Natasha told us? There's a girl's parade in here every day. Temper! Hello, Iris, Elena here. Yes, listening. I need to see you, something incoceivable's happened. - Honey, I'm off to Mykonos, right now. - Mykonos, when? All right. Inconceivable, I'm telling you. I can't discuss it over the phone. Yeah, OK, I may come there. OK, kisses, 'bye. Tighten the waist a bit, please, that's fine. Yeah, yeah, that's good. A bit of shortening, there... Again? All right, let'em wait. Well-done, Mdm. Natasha! - This lady's got some taste. - Much money too. And a first class alibi. Can we prove there's a procuring business here? We must prove it. Doesn't all this luxury exasperate you? Temper... didn't we agree? Good morning! Come and sit, please. I thought you wouldn't have to come here again. I'm afraid we may have to come again a few more times. Truth is I'd rather you won't have to. - This will depend on you, too. - But you have interrogated me and my personnel, what else do you want to know? - Who killed this girl. - How might I connected to the crime? - Jenny was working for you. You arranged her and other girls' meetings. - This has not been verified. - Listen.... madam. We're not here to investigate if you're a panderer or not. Please, mind your language. It's only natural that the girls receive some flirtatious phone calls. What right do I have to forbid any relations? I understand. It is so. But did you perhaps happen to hear when Vergis first met Jenny? All I know is that two days ago she was about to go to his cabana. - How do you know this? - I was told so. - By Jenny or Vergis? Jenny. I'm a friend to all the girls and they confide in me. - Did you know she was married? - Of course. How would you explain the fact that a married girl met a man for a price? Neither the first nor the second one. - Are you acquainted with Vergis? - I'm acquainted with a lot of people. He claims Jenny never went to his cabana. But there's a definite testimony that she got to his cabana. From then on her traces are lost until she got killed. How would you explain this? How do you expect me to explain something you cannot explain yourself? Do you know Jenny's husband? Very little. I think he's an actor, a failure if I'm not mistaken. - You make no assessment? - No, none. Enough for today. Why are you ruling out suicide? That would be convenient for us all. - You had 2 phone calls from the call centre. - Thanks. Yes, Miss, this is Elena Chrysou. Yes, a flight to Mykonos. What time? That's very good. Please, get my bill ready, too. Thanks. I had asked for the newspapers. - I put them all in the veranda. - Thanks. I don't want to be disturbed, Miss. I'm not in for anyone. Yes? Yes, Natasha? My nerves are shot. It's absolutely urgent that I see you, we must talk. Yes, I want to talk to you, too. I'd rather meet here. After 10. All right. I'll be there at 10:15. Agreed. I'll be expecting you. Can we move on with these charters? Yes, after contacting Hamburg. I suggest we deferred as long as possible till the sterling's stabilised. - Anyway, see to all these. - Perhaps examine the Ministry's intentions? Yes but first come to an agreement with fuel companies. Mr. Nikolaidis? For the new ship routing you'll have to start making proposals. Thank you, gentlemen. - Excuse me, before you go I'd like to... - Leave me now, I'm busy. Mr. Vergis? A lady's waiting outside for you. Let her in. - What a mix-up, eh? - Sit, Natasha. Is the Police calling on you, too? Naturally. The Police are doing their job. And they'd better do it right. Poor Jenny. - I heard that she was married. - Yes. Had any children? A two-year-old little girl. I'd like to help her. - Are you always that kindly? - No, you're wrong. I'm not at all kindly, I'm just feeling some remorse. I mean... I seem to be a bit kindly, because a nasty thing's happened. You're exaggerating. Are you to blame for this? I am, actually. You are, too. Well, of course not. Thanks to you and me, the girls live in comfort. Next thing you'll say you're doing this for charity and that I'm a national benefactor. - I wouldn't go that far. - Then let's leave it at that. What's done cannot be undone. Anyway, I have called you here for something else, too. What else? The strangest thing in this story. I don't understand. This Jenny never came to my cabana. What? But some other woman did. And that other woman came the following day, too. She introduced herself as Jenny. Did you tell this to the Police? This remains between us. But she probably knew both Jenny and you because she mentioned your name. Well, I only sent you Jenny, no one else. Natasha, beware. This is quite serious. The girl who came to my cabana must be found. Because if she's not, both my position and yours will become real difficult. Neither Vergis, nor Natasha. Neither of them. Patience... That other one doesn't speak a word. He claims he has no idea. It must be him, though. - But there's nothing in the papers of all this. - Fortunately. - Are you sure it's the same girl? - Absolutely. I told her I was his secretary, that he couldn't see her and I gave her money. - She told you her name, too? - I asked her. And then... you went to his cabana? Uh-huh. Hello, I said to him. Jenny. - The following day I went again. - Same time? - At exactly 4. I rang the bell... - Amazing! Don't know if I could do it. Why did you? An inspiration of the moment, nothing more. So, what was he like? Very exerienced. But after leaving I thought of his filthy behaviour, I was so infuriated I didn't sleep a wink all night, imagine that! Strip, please, I'm in a hurry. - But you went again. For quite a different reason. I detested him and wanted to humiliate him or something. - But why? I don't understand. 'Cause he had all that sophisticated vulgarity of the rich buying all they want. But, for Christ's sake, Elena, we're filthy rich ourselves. Aren't we the same, Iris? That's why we're unhappy deep inside. So what's the idea? Have you come to Mykonos to make me brood? I've thought about this over and over. Now I realize once again. We use our money to have others do whatever we fancy. Ah, Elena, please! Enough honesty for today! That's why deep inside we're not so happy. Take Vergis for example, what does he lack? Young, handsome, filthy rich, yet, instead of a substantial thing, he prefers to buy one woman a day. Just like ordering lunch, am I wrong, Iris? - No, but... I wonder, has it crossed his mind that whatever the reason for this murder, whoever the killer is, he's to blame too? Well, perhaps the Police are suspecting him? Should you perhaps not disappear but stay there and help him? I'll be glad to hear he's been arrested. Elena, darling, you're too much in love. What that monster? And with only having met him twice? Not me! Is that you Natasha? Any news? Any girl who knows her, perhaps? No, no, me neither. Dunno but I have a hunch that the girl must be away from Athens. With all this hubbub in the press about the crime, she must be away from here. Well, I'd say... Judging by the girl's type she must be on one of those cosmo- politan islands, Rhodes, Mykonos... Police Major Alexiou. Good morning, Mr. Vergis. No, no progress yet. Have you absolutely ruled out accident or suicide? 99%. That's why we've had the Press hold any publication. Yes, I see. I'm calling to notify you that today I'm sailing to the islands in my yacht. If you need me, my office will always know exactly where I am. Thank you very much. He's leaving for the islands in his yacht. - For pleasure, you believe? - No but it could be possible. What shall we do with Karalis? He's outside. Let's change our tactic. Show him understanding. What do you say? I agree. Quite often when you go easy on them they get things off their chest. Tell them to bring him in. Have a seat, Mr. Karalis. Want a smoke? Listen. I know exactly how you feel. It's only natural that when you discovered your wife's job, you saw red and... - I didn't kill my wife. It wasn't me. - We've been through that. Yes but you didn't believe me. That day I spent the whole afternoon at home. - You didn't go out at all? - I was working on my role. I had a rehearsal with a new troupe the following morning, I was studying my role all afternoon. I believe you but... can you prove it? I usually study my roles aloud. Someone from the neighbors must have heard me. Go get the lady from the apartment next door. Hello? No, Mr. Vergis is out. He's away from Athens. Can I reach him somewhere? I don't think you stand a chance. He's on a holiday break. Can I have his phone where he is? Dear Miss or Madam, I told you he's on a break. A break, generally speaking. A break of all kinds. The lady took it as an insult. Well, I'll be! - You could use some spanking, you know that? - Why? 'Cause, honey, although you have anything, you lack everything. Then I'd better go back to London where I'm also bored but I don't protest. Yes, Miss. We asked for a phone call to Athens. Hold on. Yes, hello? Are you Mr. Vergis's secretary? Yes, I know. Is there not a way of contacting him? Very well. Then please, take down my name. Jenny. Simply Jenny. Where am I calling from? From the Beyond. - You see? I'm calling him so that... - So that? So that I may relieve him from the worries he possibly has, oh but the gentleman is on holiday. He doesn't care about murdered Jenny nor the other one. - Who knows that? Don't be naive. If he had been annoyed with this story in the slightest, he would have at least... - What? Nothing. Too much bother with him already. Will you drive me to the airport? - Of course. - Iris? - Yes, bankers? Promise once again you'll never tell anyone anything at all? Thanks. Vergis. Any messages for me? Yes, just now a Miss Jenny asked for you. What? Where? When? Said she was calling from the Beyond. The Beyond? What are you talking about? All right. Be on the alert and call me at once. At all costs. Any news from Natasha? Wait a minute till this damn plane goes away, I don't hear a thing. Is your apartment on the same floor as Mr. Karalis's? Yes, inspector, right next door. Also we often meet in the elevator and... Do you perhaps know whether last Thurday afternoon, the day his wife was killed, Mr. Karalis was at home? - Yes, he was home. - How do you know? You saw him? No but I heard him study something. He was reading out his role. Mr. Karalis is an actor, you know? - So then... From 3 to 5, let's say, you were listening to him in there? But yes, I didn't even sleep. I was trying to take a siesta, but because he spoke too loud, I knocked on the wall at one point but he probably didn't hear. I didn't insist, the poor man works too hard, he's a bit unlucky with his work. All right. Good evening! Iris! Hello there! How are you? Sit down! Waiter! What will you have? A Campari with bitter lemon. When did you arrive? - Only just now. You should've been here earlier. - What for? I threw quite a wild party. Expecting a girl? - No, why? - You give me this impression. As if waiting and looking for a girl. - And why necessarily a girl? Oh, come on. Perhaps I'm spoiling something? You want me to go? No, on the contrary. Then do your thing, feel free to look around, never mind me. - I'm sorry. - Now really, Thanos, how long will you keep on being a bachelor? Until I find her. Is it so hard to find a good, tidy girl with a dowry? Seems to be. Well, you women have recently turned very clever. Oh, you realized that now? Perhaps you found one? I may have, quite possibly. Don't go, I'll be right back. Excuse me, you have a phone call from Mykonos. Yes? Hi, Iris! Elena, incredible! Mr. X is here. We're having drinks together. - You don't say! What's the phone number there? Hold on, I'll write it down. Yes? Yes. All right, hang up, now. Thanks. Excuse me, I have to go now. They're expecting me. - 'Bye then. - Hey! Why not come with us? Where to? We're going to Delos to do some longline fishing. - Thanks but no, thanks. - We'll have a swell time, trust me! - Mr. Vergis, please? - Yes! Here! - You're wanted on the phone, Sir. - Excuse me, 'bye. Yes. Finally. You're saying that? Yes and I'm being honest. I'm glad to hear you. Listen, Jenny, I've searched high and low for you. - Strange... - Where are you calling from? - Same place. - What do you mean? The Beyond. - Jenny, stop joking, where are you? - What for? I'll be there at once. - You can't, it's too far away. - I don't care. - Then come, I'm waiting. - Where? - In Athens. Jenny, I don't get it. Why are you hiding? From now on, you'll call me Elena. Elena? Hu-huh! I'm waiting for you. Give me your phone number, your address. I'll call you when you get here. Excuse me, Olympic Airways have called. They're asking if you want to make a reservation for London. Tell them I'm not leaving. I changed my mind. He's got a solid alibi. Especially after that lady neighbor's testimony, I see no other option. We must release him. - I agree. Quite often when they think we don't suspect them anymore, they sing a note out of tune and are disclosed. You're a perfect theorist, Platis. Too bad you're oversuspicious, otherwise you're a good cop. - Excuse me but, I believe a good cop must be suspicious. - Not when the alibi is rock solid. Anyway, I've got him waiting outside. Get him in here. Come. Come in, Mr. Karalis. Your detention is over. But the case is not. You're now free but... beware. Don't try to disappear or... Why should I disappear? I'm innocent. Until this file is closed for good, no one's innocent. Neither you, nor Natasha, not even the millionaires... customers. Anyway. Sign here. Mr. Alexiou? Can I see you for a minute? What is it? This is the janitor of the building where Karalis lives. He found this note pinned on Karalis's door and brought it to us. "Mr. Karalis, that tape recorder you borrowed from my store last Wednesday afternoon, you never brought it back and I'm in need of it. Thank you, S.P." Just a thought. A bit suspicious, of course... - Do you have Karalis' apartment key? - Yes, the owner's given it to me. What are you waiting for? You told us that that midday you heard him recite some verses, or a role... Yes, that's what I told you. Do you perhaps remember what it said exactly? No. - If you hear it again? - I might. (Recitation of verses from Aeschylus' The Persians) Ah, yes, this is it. Yes? Mr. Vergis? Yes? A friend of mine and Mrs. Natasha have spoken to me very warmly about you. You?! When can I see you? What did you say your name was? Elena. And for a few, very special friends... ... Jenny... Well? Come to my house this evening, at 9. A very nice garden. You live here alone? I used to live here alone. This way, Elena. Elena. How do you like my new name? What difference does it make? Which one do you like better, Jenny or Elena? I would rather know the real one. Shall we toss a coin? - Jenny, how about a serious talk? - You called me Jenny, there! - I'm sorry. - You see? For now I'm both Jenny and Elena. And since I have to be one or the other I suggest we toss a coin. Got any change? I spent mine on the taxi. First, you haven't yet told me what you will drink and second, I'd like you to call me by my first name, Thanos. But we're not that intimate, yet. - You think so? - OK, then. We either toss a coin or you decide which name you prefer. - You haven't decided on a drink. - Whisky. Splash of water, lots of ice. - So I have to choose a name? - I'm warning you, though. Each one of those names is a sort of a ...signifier. One of them signifies the way of virtue, the other one the way of vice. Think and make your choice. You know something? What? I'd like to beat the hell out of you. Why don't you try it? We're not that intimate yet. Elena? Is that your choice? Who are you? Elena. What brought you to my cabana, who sent you? Professional secret. Perhaps Jenny couldn't make it so she asked you to come in her place? - I asked her not to come. - You knew her? - I first met her outside your cabana. - When? That afternoon. I told her you were busy, I paid her and she left. - Why? - So that I would come. And how on earth did you know that I... Professional tip. Nothing more? Nothing more. Elena, I am convinced that you're keeping something from me. Such as? Dunno... but it all sounds a bit... A bit suspicious, right? Is that why you were looking for me? That too. There's something else, as well? - What's new, boys? - Here's the latest. There's been endless tailing and trailing, Inspector. I was outside Vergis's house. He had a first class visit. Well-done, Mdm. Natasha! The pretty lady left around 2 am and went to another manor. - Got the address? - Yes, a villa near Lagonisi. - And then? - She spent the whole night there. Don't lose them. Keep tailing both her and Vergis. Mdm. Natasha... - You insist? - I insist! I'm giving you one minute. I didn't send any girl to Vergis last night. - Is this phone connected to any other ones? - Yes, to that one. I'm giving you an option. Call Vergis and ask him what girl he was with last night. Mr. Vergis, please? Natasha here. Forgive me, I forgot to notify you. Yes, I finally found her. And of course her name's not Jenny. She just showed up as Jenny that afternoon. Excuse me, I have to hang up now. I will call you later. Fine. And now we can speak the truth. That afternoon when Jenny was killed, some other girl had visited Vergis. She told him her name was Jenny. - Vergis did not tell us this. He was with her last night. My respects. So that's why you didn't want me to know where you lived. - So how did you? - I had you followed. - How did you dare? - How dare you do what you do? - For fun. - Has he conceded the house to you? - Oh, yes, that darling. - May I know why? - We're acquainted. - That much? - Veery much. - Since when? - I don't remember anymore. But he could be your father! There's something deeper between us. And never touch this again. I forbid you to. How can you go to bed with so many men? How can you, with so many women? For us men it is different. And we women try to get used to what you want. How else? Would you like to kick this habit? If I don't try, how should I know? Good. Pack up your things and let's go. - Where? - Away. Dunno, I need to think first. There's nothing to think, this is my decision. Don't use this tone with me! Yes or no? How much? - Did you say "how much"? - It's best to keep a clean slate. You as a businessman should appreciate that. Well, I'm listening. You tell me, sir. - How much are you asking for, ma'am? - How much are you offering? - I know nothing about... - Permanent partnership, right? Exactly. Neither do I. - Have you a piece of paper? - By all means. Here you are. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So then. 5.000 for hire. For services, 4.000. Food and drinks... 9.000. 10.000 for clothing. Miscellaneous unforseen 10.000... Don't tire yourself out. You know how much I'm making now? - It's not the same thing. I'm sorry. It's no good for me. - But ...with 35.000? - Oh, you're close-fisted, too! All right, how much are you asking? 150.000. A month?! You see, exclusivity costs. Let it be so. Also... A month's pay in advance. What? For my mental tranquility. It's a disgrace! A disgrace! Well, no! Well, no, for damn sake! Madam! Excuse me. Two gentlemen from the police. What? - Good morning. - Good morning. What is it, Mr. Alexiou? - I'm sorry, Mr. Vergis but you must both follow me. - What for? Withholding evidence and complicity to murder. Mr. Joseph! Mr. Joseph! We must notify his lawyers at once! - I'm not quite following. - Both he and she have been arrested. - Is that a bad thing? You don't understand, they're mixed up in that call girls' dirty business. Excuse me, whom are you about to serve? He'll be here for lunch shortly. Are you not listening? Mr. Vergis has been arrested. So what of it? Shall he be left unfed? He's at the Police station, he's in de-ten-tion! - When he finishes, he will come. - But when? In one or two weeks? That's impossible. He's very precise with his timing. We must call his office immediately. His lawyers. Put the flowers down! All my life I've been interacting with millionaires. None of them remained in detention for more than one hour. Yes. But this is a serious case. Nothing to worry about, he'll soon be here. I also have a surprise for him. - Like what? - Come with me. Do you know her? - It's that... - Elena Chrysou. Daughter of Leo Chrysos. - Of Leo?! - Of course. She stayed in Lagonisi, in the cabin next to ours. - What?!! - I often saw her. - Why didn't you say so all this time? Unfortunately there is also another solution. - What was that? - I'm talking to the lady, not you. - Pardon me. - What solution? The worst one, of course. Meaning? And if need be, I'll get as far as that. I advise you against doing anything foolish. - I told you I'm talking to the lady. - Pardon me, once again. What folly are you referring to? Of us getting married. My God, the horror! And what will your circle say if you marry a... I think it's something original and... and revolutionary. What's more, I will relieve my conscience. I will marry one of the girls with whom I... What do you say? I find it melodramatic. Damn it! Pick up that cigarette! Right now! "...and the night was coming down..." I don't think we need hear any more. But the tape recorder... I always use it when I study... You borrowed it on the day of the crime. Only to create an alibi. And here's a testimony by S.P. who lent it to you. The show's over, Karalis. Stop putting on an act. You're right. I killed her. But it was an accident, I swear. I loved Jenny. I meant her no harm. I only wanted to threaten her. When they told me that she made those visits... I didn't believe it at first. I couldn't believe it. But one day I followed her. She went to a house and the following day to another one. How could she do that to me? The woman that I loved? The day she went to the cabanas, I decided to straighten things out with her. I waited for her outside. I took her and we stopped over on the road to Sounio. We had a row. I beat her. During the row... the handbreak was released and before I had the time to do anything the car rolled off the cliff. It was an accident. Believe me! Mr. Vergis, will you be kind enough to step inside? Sure. Fortunately for all of us, the case is closed. - So the culprit's been found? - He's just signed his confession. It was the husband after all. - But you said he was at home that day. Only his voice was there, playing over a tape recorder on purpose so that neighbors could hear him and give him an alibi. - Therefore a premeditated crime. - Well, he claims it was an accident. But the meer presence of the tape recorder belies him. So now I only have to congratulate you or is there... - No, no, you're free to go. - The lady, too? - She just left. She left? Then I should run, I congratulate you once again, goodbye. I'm under the impression, Platis, that something's cooking between those two. You've started getting suspicious yourself, Major? Hey, Mr. Vergis! - You're here? When did you come? - Two hours ago. How's Hyde Park doing? Fine. Sends you its love. I heard you were arrested. - Too bad, they released me. - Already? - I'm innocent. - Pity! - Let's dine at Hilton, then. Your mom's waiting. - I'll go change. Hello! Hello. - Aren't you...? - Vergis. I remember you. Chrysos. Chrysos, eh? - What brings you? - Me? Tourism. And you? A permanent resident. Permanent, eh? When are you leaving? Shortly. How about right now? I'm afraid not. I'm waiting for Elena. Elena? What a coincidence... I'm waiting for her, too. - Oh? - Hu-huh! - Elena, what does the gentleman want? - I'll explain. Excuse me, Mr. Vergis! Excuse me. - What is it? - The girl is Leo's daughter. Leo's? Who's Leo? Leo Chrysos. That's him. - Then she's his daughter? - That's what I'm telling you. Sorry 'bout that. Searching for you... wandering in the city streets... darkness so thick... putting on the sky's outfit... all those shut doors around lonely yesterdays abound endless hours on the rebound yet still I search for you... Searching for you... trying to spot you in the crowd... and strolling alone... pacing in this dready cloud... faintly calling your name tripping down that memory lane glassy faces, faces aflame longing for your return... faintly calling your name tripping down your memory lane glassy faces, faces aflame longing for your return... - Mr. Vergis? - Yes.
