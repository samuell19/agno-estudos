Sweetie, now you want to go with mommy. You want to go with her. Hi, baby. Are you hungry, baby? Are you hungry? Let’s go have some boobie. - You didn’t go to the bar? - No, we didn’t. - I left the rent money on the table. - OK. I’ll get it. - Here, take this. - Put it here. Hey, you’re all bent, baby. Mine? Is it my weenie? And no other girl’s. I don’t want girls. Only mom’s. What a weenie! Oh! Let’s see, may I borrow it? Here. You don’t want? Okay, it’s okay, come on. Come with me. I could only feed him from one boob. I’m making him mashed potatoes. There were lots of people and they didn’t want to cut them. I liked the pink ones more... Come here... - Hello? - Hello, it’s Oscar. - Hello Oscar, I’ll be right down. - No, they’ve already let me in. - Oh, they let you in? - I’ll be right up. Okay, come up. - Love you, baby. - Kiss for mommy. No, no... Shh... Hello sweetie, how are you? I came accompanied. - Hey, don’t you have a friend? - No, I was only expecting you. You didn’t tell me anything. I can take one at a time, if you want, and I’ll call you when you are finished. No, come on, don’t be mean. We’ll both go, okay? - A little bit each. - Come on, we’ll give you a present. - No, no, I don’t work like that. - But come on... No, no... No! - Come on, come on... - No! Get out! No! Come on, sweetie, come on! Oh, so your friend is here... So now we have one for each... - What’s going on? - Calm down! It’s an inspection. - The neighbors reported you. - We live here! - We’re two friends who live here! - Two friends? And those flyers? What do you care? Just leave! Get out! - Wait! Don’t get like that! - Get out! Don’t you see the baby? Who named you Alanis? They named you like that because of the singer, right? You know who I’m talking about? Morrisey. Okay then, doesn’t matter. Who pays the rent? Give me the names and we leave. - We do. - We who? We who? Us. Whose name is on the contract? I don’t know. You have flyers on every corner. Reports from neighbors. Tell me. I’m here to help you. I have the best intentions and these guys, they’re pretty calm. There’s no fire extinguisher? We’ll put one. We’ll enable it as a massage parlor. I’m a good massage therapist. - And this? - It’s a pocket knife. What? - This is a cutting weapon, I’ll take it. - That too? What? They’re condoms. What, you don’t use rubbers? You guys give them to me. They have logos. Come, stay. We can share. - Ma’am... You can’t leave. - No, I’m not leaving. How many girls are there? Tell me, is someone under age? She brought you, right? How long ago did she bring you? No one brought me. I work because I want to. - Oh, yeah? Are you sure? - Where’s my son? But you give her a cut of it, how much do you give her? What are you doing? Get out of my house. That’s my money. Just stop... Look what a beautiful baby you have... Don’t you want us to help find another place for you? What do you do when he cries? You can’t say to the clients... Save yourself. Thieves, motherfuckers! Does he have his vaccines? You know that he has to be vaccinated, don’t you? Why are you taking her? We’re getting her statement in relation to code 840. She also works and takes care of my baby. I need your phone. - No, please. - I’ve got to take it. I’ll give you the chip if you want, but leave me the phone. In 48 hours you can come pick it up. Okay, sign here for me. Here you have the penalty fee and the reforms. There’s lots of cardboard near the water heater. You don’t have an emergency exit. On the back you have the address of where to pay. - You’ll need the rent contract. - I haven’t got a contract. Where do you want me to go? I’m with the baby. That’s why I’m saying, do you want me to relocate you? No, I don’t want to go anywhere, I want to stay here. You can stay, but you can’t receive anyone. If I find out you’re receiving clients, we’ll come back, is that clear? I’m coming back, stay here. Come, honey, we’re choking. Here. Hello? Hello, José, it’s Alanis. No, Gisela isn’t coming to work today. She has a family issue. Can I help you? Okay, it’s fine, call Gigi tomorrow. Bye, sweetie. Bye. Stop, what are you doing? - Leave this... You’re marking the door. - Oh, sorry. Listen, it’s so good that you came, I didn’t know where to call you. What did you do here? What the hell happened? They pretended to be clients and let themselves in. This is a huge mess. It was probably the neighbors, for sure. No, it’s all fine with the neighbors. We’re all peaceful here. Yeah, really peaceful. But who sent the police? What is this smoke? It was me, I forgot the pacifiers were boiling... - They didn’t cut anything off? - No. Look, there’s electricity. There’s water. Everything. Thankfully, because once they take away the gas they won’t give it back. Shitty people, that think they can enter someone’s house - and do whatever they please. - Yeah, obviously. They’re in the mood to annoy people, you know. They want money. They don’t respect anything. Fortunately we have you here... The thing is this doesn’t work for me, okay? I told your aunt. I’ll rent you the apartment. But don’t make a mess, don’t make a mess! Okay, but it wasn’t our fault. Gisela left with the inspectors. - What? They took her? - No. You guys are going to make me lose the apartment. - Stop, nothing is going on. - I don’t want to talk anymore with you. I’ve always worked with your aunt and I want to keep working with her. She isn’t my aunt. Listen to me, listen to me. If you can make us a rent contract, we can enable this as a massage parlor. If my grandmother ever saw this she would die again. No, they’re motherfuckers. I totally understand, Santi. To make it worse it isn’t going to end now. It’s just begun. It’s going to bring a bigger mess. No, just wait. It’s only the door and the mirror. I’m going to take care of everything. We’ve always done what you asked. - Did Gisela pay the rent? - Yes, yes. - But, dude... - Stop, stop. - Let me. - But this can’t be. Let me. Don’t worry. If I can’t, I’ll call someone to help. No, don’t call anyone else. I don’t want anyone else to enter the apartment. Listen. I’m going to fix everything. Until the authorization isn’t ready, no one else enters. Stop, move. Let me try something. - Let’s see, hold here. - Okay. - There we go. - Yeah? - Yeah, I think so. - Oh, great. Let’s see, careful. Move. Careful. - I’m going to try closing. - Okay. - It works. - Yeah? - Yeah, I think so. - Great. Let’s see, I’ll try one more time. Careful with your fingers. Yes. Hey. Santi... Hey! I don’t have a key. Santiago. Santiago... Come on, dude. Don’t fuck around. Hey! Santiago! Dude, open the door! Let me pick up my stuff, Santiago! Santiago! Asshole! Come on, dude, open. Let me take my things out. Stop the banging! Just stop, please! Santiago! Charly! Charly... Charly... Charly... Charly... Let’s see, baby... I’m an asshole... Charly! Charly... I’m not taking it. Why not? It fits you perfectly. Let’s do something, try this size. Trust me, it’s going to fit. What are you doing here? What happened? - Hey. - Hi. Did something happen? Yeah, I need to stay here a few days because we got kicked out. Here? Yeah, I don’t have a job and I don’t have enough for a room. What happened? You didn’t pay? They kicked you out? Gisela got in a fight with the owner and they didn’t let us take our things out. - I’m not going to buy it. - No? One more. Try one more. I’m sure this one is going to look spectacular on you. Try it on, trust me. - There’s not place here. - It’s just for a few days. Gisela is looking for a new place. Come, wait for me in the back, please. I’ll be right there. Let’s see... Spectacular. Spectacular. I don’t know. It makes a crease here. Don’t cry. Here. Careful, it’s going to get wet. Look, hold it. Take care of it. Let me... There’s pee in there. We’re going to change the diaper. Let me see. Come. You want me to give it to you? Look, this is plastic. Play with this. Here. There you go. Let’s see, baby. Don’t cry. Don’t cry, look. Done. Look. Hi! Here, take my phone. Call someone. There we go. Pardon me, didn’t know you were here. Andrea told me I could come in. It’s okay, doesn’t matter. Let’s see, I’m going to put on this diaper. Like that, son. Let’s see. Okay, don’t get angry. Let’s see, there. Done! And this cutie pie? Say “Hi”. - What’s your name? - Dante. - Román. - Hi, nice to meet you. How old? Year and a half? Yeah, he turned a year and a half yesterday. - Does he eat chicken? - Yeah, but only cutting it small. Do you have a charger that I can borrow? Because it’s dying. - Let me see. What brand is it? - I don’t know. - Leave him on the floor. - Really? - It’s clean. I just cleaned it. - Let’s see. Come. Look. Look at all the things you’ve got there. In the kitchen. Let’s see, bring me something. Bring me something. Cake mold... Very good. What are we going to eat? What are we going to eat? What are you going to prepare? - Let’s see if mine works. - Let’s see. Yes... - They all came with faults. - Let me see... Don’t touch them, your hands are dirty. No, leave it. I’ll give them a few stitches and sell them cheaper. Where can I plug in my phone? There, next to the tube. It’s my friend’s, not mine. They didn’t even let me take out my phone. María is going to stay with us for a few days. Yes, three or four days until I get a job and enough for the rent. - Come with me. - Okay. - Come on, Dante. - Leave him, I’ll take care of him. - Yeah? - Yes. I'll make you the bed in the store. You'll be more comfortable there. Hello, baby. Hello, baby. Let’s go play? Come. We’ll play here for a while. Come. Come with this, with this and this. Come here for a while. Put this here, this there. We’ll sit here. Let’s see, and look. Let’s see, there we go. And this? What’s this doing? Look. There! Hello! Hi! Leave him, he’s asleep. I’ll take care of him. You go take a shower and change your clothes. Sorry, he’s missing his crib. I’m going to see the owner today. I need my clothes and things. Hi, baby. Hi baby. Beautiful. Pretty... - Twenty one. - Let’s go. - Did you bring your ID? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. They gave me this paper so I could come here to get my merchandise. Yes, but that is a fee. You have to go to Carlos Pellegrini 211. To the Direction of Infringements. Can you look for it? It’s some necklaces, watches... No, no. They’re not going to give back your merchandise. Here it says this is a fee you have to pay. I don’t know if I’m in the right place, but they closed down my house and I need to recover the things that they’ve taken. No, it’s not here. You need to ask for a controller - at the Direction of Infringements. - But stop, I need to recover my phone. - I didn’t come to pay the fee. - Fine, wait a second. Yes, it’s a fee, but you were wrongly directed. You don’t pay it here. You’ve got to go to this address, 450 Marcelo T. Hey! Hey! Assistant, assistant! I need to recover my phone and my money. You told me they were going to return it. I’m sorry but I can’t right now. I have an emergency. But stop. You told me they were going to return it. Where do I have to go? Your things are in court. Your friend has a court case open. So you need to have patience. Okay, fine, but the phone is mine. It’s not my friend’s. But the things aren’t here. I can’t help you anymore. Where is Gisela? She’s in the 14th. precinct, but I think that today she’s being moved to court. What, arrested? No, she’s delayed, but don’t go to the Police Station. Did you hear me? Come... Come tomorrow and we’ll see what we can do. I have a son, do you remember? You guys left us on the street. I asked you if you wanted us to reinsert you, to relocate you. Give me a few days, let me see if I can put you in some program. Come tomorrow at five. I have an emergency now. Hello, José. It’s Alanis, Gigi’s friend. How are you? No, Gigi is still with her family. But don’t you want us to see each other? And you can’t right now? Yes, now. No, they’re fixing my house. Do you want to meet up at the station? Come on, baby. Yes, see you there. Bye. Can’t we go to the apartment? I’ve already told you that they’re fixing it. Let’s see... Let me. They’re going to... I can’t make it work... The hotels are very expensive. Let me. Relax. I’ll give you the money anyway, but we’ll stop now. It’s 400. - Take 200. - But it costs 400. Girl, you didn’t do anything. José, José, I need 400. No, no, no. Leave it, no. Stop, get out. - I’ll go in, thank you. - Okay. Hello, I’m calling about an in-home service. 372 Pasteur. Yes. How long will it take you to come? But I’m with a baby. Can you come earlier? And your baby? Didn’t you say you had left your baby? No baby. Are those things yours? Who lives here? Are you fucking me? Do you hear me, girl? - Are you stealing? - These are my things. No, I’m not stealing. I have 200 pesos. I already know it’s not enough. Do you want to come in? Go ahead, come in. Hi... Oops! Stand up. Come, baby. We have to give the lad some candy. He behaved very well. He’s a very good baby. Isn’t that right? Let’s see, that, eat. - And that outfit? - Román bought it for him. He couldn’t keep looking that bad, you know? - Let’s see... - I brought him a yogurt. Oh, but... Give it to the lady. He just drank some warm semolina. There we go! Did you see how his butt was, right? I bathed him. He really smelled like food... Yeah, I couldn’t come earlier because they didn’t let me enter. Poor little one... Because he fell... And the money? No, they found it and took it. - And where did you keep it? - Inside some socks. And... Oh, you don’t know... Put it on the lady... You disappeared all day, and this little monster... He looked for my boobs. He embarrassed me, the clients were staring... Look, I could take all of our things out but... I don’t know, everything’s wrong. We won’t be able to go back. Oh, but I got you a job. A client needs a girl that works by the hour. It’s not far away, take a bus and you’re there. - Cleaning? - Yes, cleaning. I told her you had references. - I’ll leave the things there, okay? - Okay. Where are you going? 800 San José. I think it’s in San Telmo. - Have you been waiting for long? - Kind of, yes. - Get on, I’ll take you. - Yes? - Come on. - Okay, fine. - I’m done. - Okay. - How much do you spend on transport? - Twenty. Twenty? Come, help me get to the bathroom. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. - OK... - Yes. On Tuesday can you come earlier? I’ll call you. If it works out I’ll put you on my payroll, okay? I promise. No, I didn’t finish high school. Twenty. No, I don’t have children. Oh, okay. I’ll send you a photo. Okay, thank you. Oh, very good! Hello? Yes, I’m calling about the ad. Yes, I know what it’s about. But I’ve always worked on my own. Yes, yes, tell me. Oh, you keep fifty percent. Let me see, give me a minute, please. Hello? Yes, yes, officer, I’ll answer, yes. Hello, sorry, I have to hang up. I’ll go by tomorrow. Okay, thank you. Hello, Gi. Hello. Good, good, we’re good, here with Dante in my aunt’s house. You? No. Everything went wrong in the apartment. How are you? It’s mommy Gigi. They didn’t tell me where they were. They didn’t want to tell me. When are you going to get out? I have to go? No, no, yes, I’ll go, I’ll go, okay. What time? Fine, okay. I’ll be there at nine. Yeah, sure, I’ll get you some cigarettes. It’s fine. Okay, see you tomorrow. Okay, calm, we love you. Dante and I, whore. Bye. - Mommy! - What, my love? Come. Show me, let’s see... Come. Let’s take a photo. Look. Selfie. Look, Dante. Okay, call someone. Sorry, is office 101 that way? Wait, stop. Passing the elevator, that way? Okay, thank you. Gigi? Hello, Gi! - Hi! Hi, petite... - Hello, friend. - What are you doing? How are you? - Here. Take it. I brought everything you asked for. - Did you bring cigarettes? - Yeah, I brought cigarettes. It’s okay, leave her a moment. They took everything, right? Did they take all the money? Assholes. You have to testify. You have to get me out of here. Yes, I’m going to testify now at 11. I’ve already told the assistant that we’re friends. - That you don’t handle me. - Yeah, but you still have to testify. Look, I’ve charged you a hundred pesos. Oh, look, he’s so cute. Look how gay the little man turned out in the picture... - Seems that he likes dressing up. - So pretty... You don’t know how much I miss him. Go ahead, I’ll get you out now. - Hello. - Hey. How are you? María, right? Yeah. Good. The idea is to ask you a few questions. For you to tell me a little bit about yourself, okay? If I don’t understand something I’ll ask you to stop... and I’ll ask you again. Is that okay for you? - Okay. How old are you? - Twenty five. I’ve got to see your I.D. María Espósito. OK... Okay, María. Where were you born? In Cipoletti. - Is your family still there? - Yes. - How many are there? - My mom and my brother. - Is your dad alive? - I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since I was seven. - Okay. You have a son, right? - Dante. - How old is he? - Year and a half. The dad? When did you get to Buenos Aires? As an adult. At 23. And how did you get here? - A client brought me. - Did he only bring you? Me and a friend. Did you know where you were going? What did he tell you? Yes, I wanted to come. I was pregnant but never told him. What did you do in Cipoletti? I stripped at a whiskey bar in Roca. And then I went back to Cipoletti, but with my family close, it’s not nice, it isn’t easy. I didn’t want my baby to be the son of the whore. How did you start in that line of work? I got kicked out of a house where I worked as a live-in maid. Do you know the client’s name, the one who brought you here? His name is Esteban. I can’t recall his last name. He was a friend of Gisela. He got us the apartment. Not this apartment, the one that we had downtown and shared with other girls. - How old were the girls? - All of age. Either way we didn’t last long there because the place was awful. We left. When Gisela got a place I left with her. All right. And you’d already had the baby? No, but I was really skinny and it wasn’t noticeable. Guys look at your boobs, not your belly. How was the birth? I had him at home. I was getting fucked and my water broke. Aha... And... Erm... Were there any complications? Sorry. I had him at the Sardá Maternity Hospital. Sorry. Do you need anything else? Sorry. I didn’t... What’s it like living with Gisela? How do you manage? Do you share the expenses, the rent? We both do our parts, we both work. Who lives in the apartment? Dante and us. While you work, who do you leave the baby with? Do you have children? Do you pay for a nanny, or does your wife take care of them? You pay rent, right? With your job. Well, imagine. Me too. I need my phone. Who do I need to ask for it? Fine, when we finish I’ll find out for you. - Do you want to tell me anything else? - No. No, I really don’t. Gisela is my friend, she works just like me, I need you to get her out. You’ll come back and know that I am Jehovah the Lord. Hallelujah. As the Lord says, there shouldn’t be lies. Because this is God’s truth, God’s commandment. He has to teach the entire world. A good Christian has to teach this commandment of God’s law. Because God has put the earthly law here on earth for human kind to also obey, right? God has put, also in Heaven, there’s God’s law. It’s perfect. Glory to the Lord. Eternal glory and obedience is there, brothers, for our soul’s salvation. Glory to the Lord. We’re also going to read Book of Psalms. Chapter 56, verse 8. In this afternoon we are learning everything that was written in the Bible. Let me see, son. Give it to me. Wait... Wait, I want to... Okay, don’t get angry. Come on. Here. You’re welcome. I’m done. We’re going home? Let’s go. Can I have the newspaper? Yes. - We’re going home! - We’re going home! We’re going home... What did you take? Oh, no. No, no... This is a mess. It can’t be. - Look what you did. - Do you have a brush or a thinner comb? Where did you go? You don’t have any money and you missed work. I don’t take care of the boy so you can go motorcycle riding. Román took me to see an apartment. Gisela couldn’t go. Did you take money out of the register? 200 pesos, to charge my phone. I was going to tell you but you were asleep. Don’t ever take money out of the register without permission. I’m not asking you to leave now, because of the little one. - This is the end. - I’m going to get a job. Oh yeah... I already know what kind of work you like to do. No, baby, no. No, no. And hurry, you don’t live alone. Come, let’s see. Give me your hands. - Want to help me get dressed? - Boobie. - Do you help me get dressed? - Boobie. - No, not now. - Boobie. No, not now. Boobie. - Hello. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Get out, get out. Get out. Look at how she leaves. Slut. I have 800, is it okay? I don’t have enough for a hotel. - No, I don’t like it on the street. - Okay, you pay for it. 500 for the fuck, 300 for the room. Fine, okay, but let’s go right now. What are you doing? What’s the matter? Sit correctly. Girl, what are you doing? What are you doing? You’re going to get yourself killed. Sit correctly. - Do you know any place around here? - Yeah. If you turn on La Rioja there’s one. - Let’s go to that one, okay? - Okay. What happened? Are you lost? You need some tanning lotion to be here... This is not your usual spot. - Sometimes. - You’re lying, I never saw you, Whitie. Can we do it the other way? 500 for the room and 300 for you? So we can have a better room? Don’t fuck with me because I’ll get out of the car. Yeah! Eh! Eh! What’s the matter, girl? Come on, try it. Come on, dance a little. Oh, yeah, like that. Yeah, look at that... Yeah... Oh, God... Let’s see, sweetie. I’ll help you. Let’s see, honey... Slowly... There you go. Let’s see... Come... Yeah... - Stop. - No, keep it on. Go slowly, baby. - No, baby, not like that, no. - Come on, just a little. - No, not the backdoor. - Come on, help me. No, slowly, come here, slowly. I’ll guide you. - Come on, a little bit. - I’ll guide you. - Come on, please, do it. Don’t be mean. - No! No! - No, not from behind. - A little bit. - No, I’ll put you in... Stop! - Come on, a little bit. - Come on, a little bit. - No, not from behind. - I’m leaving. - Come on, do it. Come on, don’t leave. - Come on. - Fine, I’ll put you in place myself. Oh, slowly. There we go, sweetie. Oh, baby, come on. Come on, slut. Come on, whore, come on. - Come on, tell me something. - Yeah, baby, yeah. Fuck me! Let’s see, baby. Let me, baby. There it is. Come.

Muah, muah, muah... Where’s my nose? Here’s my nose. There’s your nose. Oh, what a nice nose. Oh, poor thing, he got in my bed. He was crying, he was wet. Oh, oh, oh, my nose. No, no, no. I don’t want the money right now. Save it for a room. Yes? I’ll keep him until you get settled in. We’re going. No, don’t be a bitch. Where are you going to take him? - It’s my problem. - But leave him here with me. - Give me the boy. - No, leave him with me. Andrea, leave him, Andrea. - Leave him with me. - Give him to me! Leave him with me. - Give me the boy! - Leave him here, whore. - It’s okay, baby... - What’s going on? Calm down! - Tell her to give me the baby! - I told you to calm down! - Andrea, bitch! - She’s going to give him to you. - Give me my son! - Andrea, give her the baby! - Tell her! Give him to me! - It’s her son! Let her have him! Give him to me! Give my my baby! Oh, baby, you’re all agitated. Calm down. Calm down, baby, it’s okay. It’s okay, it’s okay, look at me. Do you want boobie? Yeah? Okay, wait. Okay... I have to take off my clothes. Wait, son. Here. There you go. Here. Wait, wait. - Here. Calm down. - Don’t touch me. It’s okay, it’s okay, baby. Come, my love, sit. Okay, so you’re going to take the night shift? It’s fine. That way you can take care of the baby. You know they’re eight hour shifts, the same for all? Look here, people come and go all the time. So it has to be always right, it has to be clean. We have a cleaning lady that comes, but each one takes care of their own things. Imagine, there’s twelve of us, we don’t want the dirty ones. You do everything? Yes. Okay, there is a single cost. It’s 800. Fifty for the house. If you think about staying here, it’s 70/30. And... that’s it. You handle the food on your own terms. Do you want to ask me any questions? - Do you have any doubts? - No. - Good, we’ll start when you want. - Thank you. Good, great. Awesome, welcome. Let me show you. She’s horrible. But didn’t you see? She hung up the photo. The only thing hanging are her boobs. - She’s so ugly. - What? She works here? Yeah, and you have no idea how much... Dude, stop eating so many cookies. Hey, doesn’t that make you nauseated when you are there...? - She’s so disgusting... - You’re a real brute... And why “Alanis”, because of the actress? - No, she’s a singer. - She wasn’t a model? Okay, and what’s your name? - Alanis. - No. - Your name isn’t Alanis. - What’s your mommy’s name? - Steffi... - No... You don’t need to be called Alanis with that name. Really trampy. He said tramp! He already learned. No, baby. Here, here! Tramp. Here, here, look. No, I didn’t buy water. Do I give him tap water? - Put some water in it. - Tramp... He wants a cookie. Calm down, he’s not going to miss you with so many boobs around. Hi, sweetie.
