Mrs. Bill Anderson sounds nice. Let's go get a motel room. What for? I wanna make love to you, Sue. I can't. I've never done it. I mean, it's not right. Come on honey, we're gonna get married. I mean, we ought to at least find out if we're compatible. We will, right after we're married. Nobody cares about that anymore. I mean, couples live together before they get married now and you won't even make love to me, that's crazy. Why do we always have to fight when we're together? It's just that I love you so much. I need you Sue. Oh, God! my mother would kill me. She doesn't need to know. Come on honey. Stop it Bill, I can't. (high pitched music) What are you doing? Why did you unbutton your blouse? I unbutton my blouse? You are crazy. Hell, you're really getting weird. I'm getting out of here. Call me when you regained your senses. Don't hold your breath, Sue. Give it to your next girlfriend, maybe she'll sleep with you. (door slams) (crying loudly) (footsteps thudding) (crying uncontrollably) Oh honey, what's the matter? I messed up. What am I gonna do? Well, just calm down. (sobbing) But, you don't know. Tell me what happened. I just broke up with my fiance. Why? He wanted to go to a motel. I promised my mother I wouldn't. Oh, honey he just wants to make love to you. It's natural you know. But it's not right. I'm not married yet. There's nothing wrong with having sex with someone you love. But... Loving and experiencing physical love is the most beautiful thing in the world. Is it? It is. Don't you like when he kisses you? Oh yes, but he wants to go all the way. Well, do you love him? Yes, Very much. Well, just let nature take its course. But I'm frightened. There's nothing to be frightened of. What is he gonna do? It's very beautiful. Well, first he'll hold you in his arms and kiss you very gently on the lips. (tranquil music) Then he'll just kiss you tenderly and lick your lips very gently. You'll feel his tongue on you and you start sucking it. Sucking it deep into your mouth. Then you pretend that it's his throbbing, pulsating cock, about to explode his luscious juices in your mouth. (moaning sensually) Then he takes his tongue out of your mouth and runs it down your neck to your breasts and then he licks your nipple. When he gets it really erect, he takes a little bit and gently bites it, lust so gently and this about takes you to near ecstasy where you could just about cum with him biting your nipple, right gently and then he continues down your body. He continues down your body real slowly with his tongue. His hot tongue licking you all over. Down your body to be... (moaning sensually) Whenever it's time your clitoris is just throbbing and pulsating and he senses this, and he opens your legs. He opens your legs real wide and he spreads your pussy with his ﬁngers and he licks when he starts just licking you. He just saw your pussy and licks it and then he...(moaning sensually) he sticks his tongue right near your clit and he's teasing you. He's teasing you until you can stand it. Oh and this drives you crazy and you start thrusting. You wanna thrust. You wanna thrust right into him (moans softly) and you want him so badly. (moans softly) You want him and he just starts teasing you (moaning sensually) and teasing you. (moaning sensually) More. More. More? More please. (subtle music) (moaning sensually) More. More. (moaning loudly) More. More. (moaning loudly) (subtle music) (moaning sensually) (moaning loudly) (moaning softly) (moaning loudly) Oh my God. What just happened. What happened to me? (moaning softly) (shouting loudly) (indistinct) Do you know it was just that? Thank you. (shouting and laughing joyfully) All right. You're the captain! (shouting indistinctly) Pass it. Pass it here. Right here. Try to pass it here. Give it. Let's go Okay here it goes. Come on guys. (shouting indistinctly) Really, that's a great shot. With arms like that you shouldn't waste them raking leaves. Yeah. Come on Tom. Why don't you come and have some fun with us? Why don't you try playing with some real girls instead of chasing after ghosts? Yeah. Look at this, Tom. Don't real girls turn you on. He's afraid of real girls, maybe he doesn't have a cock. (laughing loudly) Oh, what's the matter Tom, are you afraid of us? Oh, it couldn't be that. Show us what you've got. [All] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you all just leave him alone. Oh, we'll show you ours, if you show us yours. (laughing loudly) let's get him girls. Go on, get it out. (gun blasts) (footsteps thudding) Get him girls, come on. (bright upbeat music) Take these clothes off of you. Oh my God. What's the matter girls? Are you afraid of a real man? (sighs softly) Come on. Well, I don't know about that. You can come and get it now. Both of you. (laughs softly) (shouting loudly) Take the wrapping off this package. Oh, it's turned on. Oh, yeah they look nice. Give me some head. (subtle music) (moaning sensually) (tranquil music) (moaning softly) (moaning loudly) Oh, yeah. (moaning sensually) Oh, fuck. Oh, baby. Oh, yeah.

(moaning loudly) (breathing heavily) Oh, shit. Right there. (moaning loudly) (breathing heavily) (moaning sensually) Oh yeah. Oh yeah (indistinct chatter) What do you wanna do? Well, (indistinct) Well if it isn't our fucking landlord. Charlene, girls. I'd like you to meet my new secretary, Charlene? What happened to the old one now? Did she gets tired of all the ropes and chains? (girls laughing loudly) Where's miss Stewart? Here I am, Harold. (footsteps thudding) Here's the rent check, lover boy. Oh, this is only for half the rent. Who's paying the other half. Your turn, Shelly. What about that one? You can't have that one. Oh! Why not? Oh, if you'd like to get the clap, Harold, go right ahead. I see. Shall we? God, what you've got to do for cheap rent. (footsteps thudding) After you, my dear. (subtle classical music) What's the clap? I don't know. (indistinct) Okay. (moaning softly) The door has locks, nobody will be bothering us. That's nice. Shall we welcome Shirley to our little group, shall we? Whatever you say, Harold. Sure. Hi Shirley. Hi. (soft classical music) Let's see what we've got here. They didn't have these when I was a boy. (soft classical music) (lips smacking) (moaning sensually) Hey, June, could you get the camera? (soft piano music) Let's get to work. Yeah. (footsteps thudding) Why don't you get down on there, Shirley. (soft piano music) (lips smacking) (buckle clinks) (soft classical music) (moaning sensually) (lips smacking) (soft classical music) Slowly. (breathing heavily) All right baby, suck it. (breathing heavily) (moaning sensually) (moaning hard) Let me sit on your face, Harold, so that you can lick my pussy. (soft classical music) (moaning loudly) That's it. (breathing heavily) (soft classical music) (moaning loudly) (moaning softly) (moaning sensually) (door thuds) When lover boy sees these, he'll give us free rent. I think I'd rather just give them to his wife. Hey, I don't know how the girls around here can be so easy. I know. Hey, did you know what they had to do for their initiation? No. What? They had to have sex with half the football team and then they ended up in a gigantic orgy. Well, they better not ask us to do that, cause that's where I draw the line. Hey, I'm gonna go home before I let anybody into my pants. (phone ringing) I'll get it. Hello. Wait a second I'll see. Hey, Sue, it's Bill. I'm not here And I'm sorry, Bill. Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye. Hey Sue, I really think you should talk to him. I mean, look, he's been calling you like crazy. Well, l'ma teach him a lesson. Hey, well, what if he teaches you a lesson and just stops calling all together? Well, he can go to hell. Hell would be a welcome change after these two. They're really gonna be a fucking problem. (siren blaring) (sharp music) Mary Lou, Rosebud! Wait for me Mary Lou. Rosebud! (thuds) That should take care of the little devil for awhile. (thunder rumbles) Excuse me. I mean, prick. It looks like we have us a real problem here. I know. I don't think we're ever gonna get those too laid. What happens if they're still virgins after tomorrow? Well, nothing much. You two will be assigned a cloud, robe and a harp and you have to sing amazing grace along with Pat Boone for the rest of eternity. (laughing sarcastically) [All] Oh shit. What can we do? There must be something. I have an idea. (laughing sarcastically) (phone ringing) Hello? Yeah, just a minute It's for you, It's your father. Hello daddy. How are you? Fine darling. How are you?
