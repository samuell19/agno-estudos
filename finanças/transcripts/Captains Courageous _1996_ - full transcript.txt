Man overboard! Man overboard! Man overboard! Ma... Man overboard! Man overboard! Man overboard! Man overboard! All hands stand by on deck. Please remain calm. Quite a hoax. This dummy made of pillows. I don't know anything about this. What did you call it again? Hoax. We have two witnesses who saw you push this dummy overboard. Witnesses? The Bradley brothers? Couple of runty finks. I should have pushed them overboard. -Harvey! -So what? I did it. It was a joke. Thanks to your thoughtless joke, the lives of our crewmen were put in jeopardy. False alarms take the edge off our crew's readiness. When a true emergency arises, our crew will be skeptical. I know. I know. That's me. The boy who cried "wolf." This prank of yours was also very costly. Two hours time was lost. Money. You know, I knew we'd get around to this. My lawyer here will write you a check. Whatever amount you say. There is more involved here than dollars and cents. Take care of it, Wade. Just a moment, young man. Harvey... Let him go. I really am very, very sorry about this. Please, give me a bill for the costs incurred. I warn you, Mr. Wade, keep that insufferable brat in check or I'll confine him to his quarters for the remainder of the voyage. If we had a brig, I'd be tempted to throw him in it. Well, Harvey... Harvey can be difficult. But he's not entirely to blame. We have to remember that the boy was orphaned at eight months. And our law firm is the only family he's ever known. Spare me. One of the richest people in the world, isn't he? Yes, he is, but as you yourself pointed out, sir, dollars and cents aren't the answer to everything. Well, you've set a new record for rudeness. What am I supposed to say, "You pompous old windbag"? The purser is a man with an enormous responsibility who is only trying to do his job. You self-centered, mindless little idiot. Did you know I could hear underwater, Wade? I don't want to lecture you, Harvey. Good. But I do want to warn you. If you cause any more trouble on this voyage, the purser means to confine you to your cabin. He can't do that. Yes, he can. If he tries it, I want him fired. Don't be ridiculous. My trust owns a lot of stock in this shipping line, right? And if the Cheyne Trust wants a rude employee fired... We have six days left on this ship. I want you to enjoy yourself, but not at the expense of others. This trip is boring. If word of your misbehavior makes the English newspapers, and Greyfriars hears of it, they won't admit you. Hey, great. We can spend the whole year bumming around. Thanks, Wade. I've been looking for a way out. Now, instead of boring classes in drizzly England, we could go to Paris, the Riviera, Monte Carlo... If Greyfriars refuses you, you're on your own. We'll see what Caniff, Tourcel and Wade have to say about that. I don't give a hoot in hell what they say. You can be fired, too, you know. Well, that will be the happiest day of my life. When I was first offered this job, I was naive enough to believe that you and I could be friends. Harvey Cheyne with a friend. You'll never have a friend because you never think of anyone else but yourself. Where are you going? I asked you a question! Go again. Come on. Give me what I need. Got it! Am I hot or am I hot? The dice, I think, need to cool off. -Let's start a new pair. -No. No. I like the way these little babies are rolling. -Go again. -Uno momento. I need to settle myself. Nothing like a big stogie to settle you down when the ship begins to pitch up and down. An old sea dog like you knows that. Sure. Let's go. Here. Here. Have one. Thanks. Left mine in the cabin. You probably smoke only Cubanos, but this is the best I can afford. Not too bad. Let's go. Okay. Yes! That is good. Very good. Now, I show you how to make these little ones dance. Hey, where you goin'? You can't leave now. Hey, give us a chance to win our money back. Hey, come back. Come on. Come back! Do you hear me? Help! Come back! Come back. Come back! Please. Help! Help! Come back! Hold on! Hold on. Hold on, now. Hold on, we're coming! Take... Take my hand. Hold my hand. Come on! Did I drown? Did he drown? Sure. You drowned, and you go to heaven. How did you pitch over? Rough water... Cigar... Couldn't help it. You are one lucky fellow. We figured you'd be cut to pieces by the ship's screw. The backwash carried you to safety. Just... Take me back to the liner. Too late. No way we're gonna catch up now. I have to get back on board. No, no, no. We go to schooner. But you don't understand. I have to get back on that liner. Feeling better? You didn't listen to me. I told you I had to get back to that liner. Have some coffee. I use cream. Do you? Where do you think you are? Not likely to see milk of any kind before the middle of September. Nearest cow's about 500 miles away. I saved you this from breakfast. I'll have fresh fruit, a poached egg, and a rasher of bacon. Not here you won't. Take what you can while you can. Who's in charge here? Captain Troop. Captain Matthew Troop. I'm his son, Dan. Cook's helper and anything that's too dirty for the men to do. This captain and me better have a little talk. He said the same thing. These are some pretty crazy clothes you were wearing. They seem to have shrunk some. Is the boy on his feet yet? Just getting dressed, Dad. Tell him I wanna see him. You heard. That's the Captain. If he wants to see me, let him come down here. Hey, Dad, he says you can come down and see him if you're anxious. You hear, Dad? Quit your foolin', Dan, and send him up. The Captain would prefer to see you on deck. Sunlight'll do you good. Good morning. Or good afternoon. You've nigh slept the clock around. So, time to set the record straight. Name, where from, where bound? Harvey Cheyne, Jr. I was aboard the Rotterdam bound for Southampton. Now, you're to take me to New York. The faster we move, the better it'll pay you. Pay me? Just what would it pay me? In dollars and cents. Hard cash. Didn't you connect the name? Cheyne. Harvey Cheyne. I do recall some Cheynes down Narraganset. Clam diggers. Look, you did the best day's work of your life when you pulled me in. Now, let's get this tub under sail, headed for New York. We never go to New York. Or Boston. Gloucester's our home port. If we did take you to New York, what be in it for us? Fifty dollars? Twenty-five? Twenty-five dollars. I'll show you money. Real money. Almost $200. My wallet! It's been stolen. What would a boy your age be doing with almost $200 in his wallet? Part of my monthly allowance. Just part of it. You didn't by chance hit your head on anything as you fell yesterday? Look, I had almost $200 in there, and someone on this boat stole it! Mister, so far there's just three things about you I'm sure of. You fell off a boat. You got a tongue that doesn't stop. And you're a liar. No one on this ship took any money from you. Okay. Okay. Forget the $200. What will it take to get me to New York? There's no way we can go back now. We just come to these fishing grounds. With good luck, we'll be ashore again the first weeks of September. It's only May. I'm not gonna sit around here doing nothing just 'cause you feel like fishing. Fishing is our livelihood. There are seven of us on board. If we go back now, it's more than 1,000 mile, we lose the season's catch. What we catch and sell is seven men's bread. I will make it up. My trust will pay you and your crewmen whatever you lose. What are we talking about? $5,000? $10,000? You'll have it. Just take me to New York. No. Okay. Doesn't have to be New York. Just pull in to the nearest port. Telephone one of the Cheyne companies in Boston, Hartford, New York... Too far from any port to put you ashore. You're with us for three months and lucky to be alive. Yeah, for three months. What am I supposed to do on a fish-kettle for three months? You'll work. We take no passengers. I'll pay you ten and a half a month. You won't be worth it, of course, but who knows, you may learn. Are you saying you expect me to scrub decks, clean pots and pans? Can't I get it through your thick head who I am? I am Harvey Cheyne, Jr. I can buy and sell this stinking boat ten million times over. Now, take me to New York! Suit yourself. You don't work, you don't eat, and you have no bunk. Dan will show you. Go forward and give him a hand. Come in. A reply to your New York cable, sir. Thank you. I'm to go back to New York on your return voyage. You are booked in your present cabin. These things of Master Harvey's, we'll put in storage. This must be difficult. Harvey and I, we didn't get on. The last day, I... I said some cruel things to him. True, but still... Trying to act as a parent without having the authority. Behind that spoiled brat facade, I always felt there was a person of great potential. He never had a chance to find out who he was or... what he might become. Seat ye! Seat ye! I'm starving. I've been looking forward to this all day. A little bit of extra just for you. Could you pass me the bread, please? I think I'll have another. Pass, pass me more. I'll get it myself. You put in two of those beans and three of the other. Who would know? Dad would know. He'd know before he even tasted it. Just from the smell. Yes, that man would. Do it right, Dan. The coffee fixes his temper for the whole day. Let the weather be good and the cod be plentiful. I can smell the new beans. I think we've found the right combination. It took some time. Tomorrow, bring two mugs, I'll share it with you. Thanks. Dan. You're growing fast. Another year, you'll be doing a full man's job on the ship. You mean I can order somebody else around? No. I mean you can take on more of my duties. But speaking of somebody else to order around... He's still just sitting up there. As if I don't have enough natural worries. I've got to worry about this spoiled puppy dog dropped onto me. Says his thanks for saving his life by calling us thieves. I think he was talking out of his head. He was near drowning and ended up with us strangers. He's the strange one. Barking orders like some drunken first mate. Bragging on about his money. A night on deck with nothing to eat has likely brought him to his senses. I've said all I had to say to him. I made him a fair offer. It's up to him now to go to work or go hungry. Seems an easy choice to me. Aye. This can't go on. I've never been so hungry. You should think. Look. Maybe you could talk some sense into your father. When we get to New York, I'll make it worth your while. I'm not interested in your money. Even though you think I stole it from you. I shouldn't have said that. I wish you'd forget it. I need another boy on my side. I could use some help with the chores. Look, I'm not doing dirty work for a servant's wages. Less than a bar steward gets paid on the Rotterdam. You're not cruising on a fancy ocean liner. You're Second Boy on a fishing schooner. You seem smart enough. If you are, you'll remember how you got here and do what's necessary. I offered your father $10,000 to take me home. Tell him I'll give him $20,000, $30,000. It doesn't have to be New York. I mean, I'll give him $25,000 just to drop me off at a decent port. Tell him. I'm not telling Dad anything so stupid. And if I did, he wouldn't listen. You're the one to talk to him. If I was you, I wouldn't go bragging about my money that no one believes you have. First thing I'd say is thank you. If it wasn't for us, where do you reckon you'd be right now? -Think about it. -Dan. -Okay. -There we go. Ahoy! Gang way! Come. Well? Well, we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot. I've been told you think I haven't acted quite right. I realize it wouldn't be easy for a man like you to understand where I'm coming from. Of course, I do appreciate what your men have done for me, and, in good time, I'll see that they are properly paid for it. You just can't bring yourself to say, "Thank you," and, "I'm sorry," can you? -Consider it said. -No. Thank you. I'm sorry. Very well, then. Go about your work. Look, instead of you paying me ten and a half a month for work, how about letting me pay you $100 a month for my passage? Maybe another $50 for Dan to be my valet? No passengers. Look, what do I have to do to make you see this my way? On this ship, boy, there's one way, my way. Now, if you want to eat, go to work. It's up to you. Come on, give it some elbow grease, Harvey. If it's not clean as a whistle, Captain'll have us do it again. You know, the worst part about work is that it's boring. I'll tell you what, we'll mix scrubbing with learning. I'll teach you about the ship. Yeah, I'll be twice as bored. Staysail, foresail, mainsail, riding sail. Isn't she a daisy? Wait till our mainsail's set, and she walks home with her salt all wet. This is worse than school. Okay, now when I say, "With her salt all wet," I mean with her hull full of salted-down fish. We wet the salt when we stow the fish. Salt's all wet. Good catch. Main hatch. It's empty now. It's our job to fill it with fish. Salted down. Hundred hogshead of salt in those bins down there. What's a hogshead? They're comin' in. Yeah. All right. Let her down easy. -What's your catch? -239. Hey. So... You feel some pretty well now, huh? Hello? This time, the other day, the fish, they fish for you. So you're the one who dumped me in with the fish. That's Harvey's way of saying "thank you." No big thanks to Manuel. What do I to? I leave you to drift? Maybe. So, now you are big fisherman. Catch. Clean out Manuel's dory. Come on. Scrub good. Not so fast. A job half done isn't done at all. Hike out the floor boards. They slide in the grooves. Never let a floor board jam, the man may need it very bad some day. On this ship, boy, we each do our best because our surviving depends on it. If I do my best, will you offer me $11 a month? In a year or two, maybe. Here, let me help you. So, this is our passenger, eh? The Captain's got you hard at it already? Yeah, well, he would. My name's Jack, Long Jack. A British Tar, as you can tell. British, is it? I'll give you British. Eh? Eh! The impudence. And me as Irish as the shamrock. I tell you, you beware of this Danny Boy. He's a terrible, terrible person. What are you? -A terrible, terrible person. -Yeah, right. He'll corrupt you inside a week if you let him. Now, you get out of my way before I gives you one. I think it's 42. Then my luck's turned at last. I counted 45. Well, 42 or 47, I lost count. Never could count, anyway. That's my uncle, Salters. He's arguing with Little Penn about who caught more fish. Seat ye! Seat ye! Dinner time. All right. About time. Pass the bread, please. Thanks. So, how old are you, lad? -Fourteen. -Oh. Same age I was when I went to sea. Just as green as you are. Not much has changed in 20 years. Hey. It must be a sad thing, for your father and mother, thinking you drowned. My mother and father are dead. I was eight months old when they died in a train wreck. An orphan. Well, what were you doing on that liner, then? Going to England. To boarding school. What? One of them snobby English schools? -You're better off without it. -Mmm. We teach you good right here. And you get paid for it. It looks like you could do with a snooze. Dressing down, we put him on the move, huh? We'll have him pitch. What's dressing down? Pitch what? We'll show you. You'll like it. Good pitch, Harv. Boy, pitch 'em bunched. Try not to scatter. Go on. Pitch. Boy, wait. You and Dan have first watch. Not me. I'm for bed. After you stand watch. I did my job. I worked hard. I need sleep. Come on, Harv. You and me. After dressing down, boys clean up. And in calm weather, boys take first watch. Says who? Me. When we get to shore, I'll make you pay for this. Maybe. Leave me alone. You're on watch. Stay awake. The men are counting on you. They sleep, I sleep. Stop it! Come on, Harvey, stop it. I don't want to hurt you. You have to stay awake. All right. All right! I'll stay awake. Dad's studying the fish. It's him and what he knows against the cod. What he knows? Weather, winds, currents, food. Only he sees it through the eyes of a 20-pound codfish. It's like he becomes a cod. That's what makes him the ace fisherman on the Banks. Okay, it's okay, now. -Dad? -Aye? We've finished our chores. Later, can we go overside a piece? It's good catching weather. Not in that fancy rig he's wearing, or those half-baked shoes. Find him something fit to wear. These were tailored just for me. One of a kind. I would hope so. Dad keeps my spare gear in here. Your mom looks nice. I didn't know you had a sister. I don't. She died. Died? She's just a kid. She had a ruptured appendix. Nearest hospital's 30 miles. By the time we got her there, it was too late. I'm sorry. My mom still cries when she thinks nobody's around. Here. Try these on. Isn't it beautiful? My dad gave it to me for my birthday. Too handsome to wear. Here you go. This should keep your brains dry. Passable. Practical. She belongs to me. My very own. Who's "Hattie S"? Someone I know in Gloucester. A girl? That she is. Grab the rope over there. Just attach it to the end, will you? Sure. Here we go. Wow! Muckle, Harv. Muckle. Right there. By your hand. Hey, your turn. I got one. I got one! Okay. Give it some room, Harv. That's a big one. Here, let me help you with that. Oh, no! It's my first fish. All mine. Is it a whale? A halibut, maybe. I'd be willing to bet my entire salary that that weighs 100 pounds. Good work, Harv. It weighs more than I do. You know, I just wish those know-it-all stewards on the Rotterdam could see me now. What's going on? Anchor's fouled. Penn's always losing anchors. Oh, Danny. This is so good of you. Again, I thank you. You're the angel of the Banks, Danny. That mix is a good sign. How's that for a halibut? It's not bad. Harvey caught it. His first fish. We'll be raising anchor. Harvey's trying. Don't you think he deserves a kind word now and then? Hey, grab the rope, will you? Harv, bait like this. Hurry it along. I want these lines out and the dories back before dark. Boy, stop your dawdling and day-dreaming. Finish up. Watch how you bait. It'll be off before it touches the water. Tight. Coil it tight. We'll end with nothing but a nest of tangles. Catch Dan's rhythm, can't you? No, I can't. I'm not Dan. If you don't like the way I'm doing the job, do it yourself. I try and I try to please you. Never can. Never will. Harder I work at it, the more you criticize, put me down. Well, Captain Know-it-all Troop, you can go to the devil. And take your trawl lines, pitchforks and stinking fish with you. Just put me on another boat. Any boat. And someday I'm gonna buy this stinking, old tub and sink it. Leave him be. Sail ho. She's coming down on us swift as smoke. Pull alongside, do you hear me? Pull alongside. Oh, no. It looks like... Abashai. King of all the Jonahs. He's loaded down her cargo with gin and meanness, as usual. Been a Jonah all his life. What's a Jonah? Anyone, anything that brings bad luck. Ahoy there! Can you spare me a hand? I got a dead one in the focsle. Need someone livelier. How about the boy? Put you on a boat, you said. Any boat. Wanna switch? Now's your chance, boy. Fill in for the dead man. How about it? Fifteen a month, and all you can drink. Dad, don't. How about it? Please, sir. No. No! No. Please. How about it? On your way, Abashai. Better get to your pumps mighty quick. Immerse you and curse you! Hoodwink you and sink you! You're all on your last voyage! None of you. You'll never see Gloucester no more! No more! There's a fine little floating hell for you. I wish he hadn't laid on that curse. What happened to the ship? Looks like her boilers burst. Drunk or sober, we gotta help 'em. Heave short. Break her out. -Aye, aye, sir. -Smart. Heave short, break her out. No survivors. All of them drowned. Never took the time to tend to their ship. Drunk beyond all caring. His own curse boomeranged on him. He took all his bad luck to the bottom with him. Thanks. Thanks for not putting me on that boat. Ship. Dan, you and the boy go in the crosstrees, and guide us back to the trawl buoys. Yes, sir. Do you know what this is? I've seen you point it at the sun, then look at that book. Somehow you know where you are. It's called a hog yoke. Fancy name is "sextant." The book is the Old Farmer's Almanac, between the two, I can figure out latitude. Seems like magic. My father taught me. That'd be something to know. Come closer. Come on. Take it in your hand. Get the feel of it. A little higher. Focus it on the sun. Here. Like that. Can you see it? Yeah. Now, you wiggle it a little bit. -Like this? -Like a baby, yeah. Till you see the sun on the horizon. Don't work at it so hard, Harv. Let her do it, mostly she'll do the job herself. Beautiful how the lad takes to it, isn't it? Yeah. Harvey, he so much want to please Captain. I think he pretend. Well, that's the way we all begin, isn't it? When we're lads, we make believe and make believe, until, finally, we cheat ourselves into being men. And so on forever. That's the way of it. Pretendin'... Always pretendin'. Not bad. At least you didn't hit anything. Though it would break a snake's back to follow in your wake. Okay, Jack! See you in another month! Not much mail. Salters. One for you here. Appears to be a bill. I don't owe nobody nothing. And, Long Jack, I think that's meant to be your name. She's just learning to write. Now you'll have to learn to read. I'll give you one. One from your mother. And I bought you something. Belonged to a Frenchman. Swears it was used to stab another sailor in a fight. Thanks, Dad. If you ever tire of it, Dan, I'll buy it from you. I'll never sell it, Harv. Never. "I put up 18 pints of berry jam. The blackberries were especially nice this year. Dan, I saw Hattie at church Sunday. She said I was to tell you, 'Hello.' I hope the catch is good, and my two men are staying well. I am fine and keeping busy. Time passes slow, and September seems a long ways off. I miss having dear Beth..." She, um, sends her love. Must be lonely for Mom. I mean, now that Beth... I know what you mean. Ever think about taking a job on shore? I was born to fish. Your mother always knew that. Hattie's a lot like Mom, don't you think? Close enough. Well, better go relieve Harv at the pumps. He's shaping up, don't you think? I do. When he first came aboard, he knew all the answers. He's learning to ask questions. Maybe I can meet Hattie when we get to Gloucester. Maybe. Do you want to see a picture of her? Sure. That's a lock of her hair. I sure see why you like her. She's prettier than that. Guess you'll marry her. I expect to. Someday. One day I'm gonna have a fleet of the new fishing boats. Haddockers, herring boats. Dad, he could find the fish, but he's no way keeping up with the times. Must cost a lot. Oh, hills of dollars. Fifteen thousand, maybe more. I figured I'll call the first one Hattie S. But Dad may not take to that. Him and me'll be partners. Dan, any chance we might partner? Well, I don't know. I mean, I'd like it, but Dad would have the final say. Yeah, you're right. And he wouldn't want me hanging around either. He's not an easy man to know. He puts up with me, but he doesn't like me. We'll bring him around, Harv. We'll work it out. Yeah. Here. This is for you. No, Dan. I couldn't. When's your birthday? Not till December. Okay, so... It's for your birthday, and for Christmas, and, just because we're dory mates, and so on and so on. Thanks, Dan. Best present I ever got. I'll keep it. As long as I live. Don't worry, Harv. Somehow, we'll work together. Partner. Partner. I didn't think you saw it. I see more than you think. How do you spell "bachelor"? Just write, "I'll never be nobody's husband." What are you reading? The Old Farmer's Almanac. The Captain gave me a lend. A word with you, lads. I've decided tomorrow, we go out before sunrise. Get a jump on the rest of 'em. All hands on deck by 3:30. Aye, aye, sir. Dories down and away. And, boy, you won't be going with Dan in the morning. You'll be going in a dory of your own. Yes, sir. Ha-ha! All right. Get some sleep. Who can sleep? A dory of my own. My own dory. Way to go, son. I still can't believe he trusts me with my own dory. It's a good sign he sees some hopes for you. It's a start. But he still doesn't call me by name. Just "boy." That'll come. First year was the same thing with me. Even though I'm his son. I talked to Dad about the partnership. The three of us. Did it make him mad? Not so you'd notice. Maybe I shouldn't go to New York. Maybe I could just stay on in Gloucester, we could start the partnership right away. What about school? Who needs school when we've got our own ship? That's not the way Dad sees it. Him and Ma are set on me having that diploma. Yeah. Which is what worries me. I go to New York, you stay in Gloucester. Year passes. It's all forgotten. The partnership, I mean. I'm not forgetting, Harv. Is that the kind of friend you think I am? No, of course I don't. I'm kind of missing Hattie. You know the best part about getting home? A night shirt. Ma'll have a new one for me. All washed soft. Yeah. Good fishing! All together, lads. Stay close to me, Harvey. That's it. Men, stay close! Line squall's coming! Back aboard! Up-anchor! Back to the ship! All aboard! Go back to the ship, Harv! Stay close to me! Penn! Penn! Anchor up! Follow me! Okay! Help! Somebody, help! It's Penn! Cut the roding! Penn, cut it! He can't find his knife! Go back to the ship, Harv! Please, go back! Harvey! Harvey, go back! It's not safe! Dan can look after himself! Somebody, help me! Hang on, Penn! I'm on my way! Dan! I'm here! Over here! It's all right. I'll cut it. I've got it! -There you go, Penn. -Go back. Are you all right? Thanks, Danny. Get back to the ship. Penn! Help! Help! Penn! Get in the dory, Penn! Help! Help! Hang on, Penn! I'm coming for you! -I'm trying. -Hang on now! That's it. Here. Grab this. Grab it. That's it. Come on, I got you. Help! I lost an oar! Ahhh! Where's Dan? Dan! Dan! Dan! There! Over there! Dan! Dan! Dan. Where's Dan? When the storm broke, Penn's anchor stuck. And Dan went to help him. We sail. Now. You heard him. Dories aboard. Hoist the main. We're under way. Little Penn, now is the time for a prayer. A prayer? Yes. "Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy... Thy will be... done." "And Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day..." "...our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." Morning coffee, sir. Go away. Go away! But, sir... How dare you? -You think you can take Dan's place? -It wasn't that, sir. I should have left you where I found you! You damned Jonah! Bad luck! Nothing but bad luck since you first come aboard! Go away! Go away! Where's the lad? Boy. Cover your head. Thank you. You're welcome, sir. Harvey. Yes, sir? Tomorrow morning, half a teaspoon less sugar. Yes, sir. Wait a bit. We're approaching land. We need to make some plans for you. Yes, sir. When we get to the dock, I'll... get a telegram off to that legal firm in New York. I would guess they'll send someone to fetch you. Yeah. Arthur Wade, I expect. If he hasn't been fired or quit. Long Jack says there's a boarding house where the crew stays. I, uh... I guess I'll stay there till he comes. I imagine you'll be going off to school. Yeah. Some boarding school somewhere. You've got a good mind. Learn to make the best use of it. Yes, sir. How will you tell Mrs. Troop, about Dan? She'll know. We lost him, Mary Ann. So... You wanna come with us? Harvey, is it? Yes, ma'am. Harvey is coming home with us. I baked a gingerbread this morning. Dan could never get enough gingerbread with butterscotch icing. Is anyone hungry? No, thank you. The boy's frazzled. It's been a lot of hours since he hauled out this morning. Of course. Just come with me. Here you are. So... You got to know Danny, then, did you? Yeah. He was the best friend I ever had. Sleep well. The Cheyne Trust, of course, can never hope to adequately repay you for what you have done. Saving Harvey, caring for him, and bringing him back safely to us. But we would like to show our gratitude with a token of, say, $10,000? No. Twenty thousand would be a more appropriate sum. Harvey? What's happened to you? Been working for my living as a fisherman. Which reminds me, I owe you your wages. Three months at ten and a half, that's $31.50. There we are. And $0.50. Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me. Why didn't you tell Captain Troop who you were? I tried, but he thought I was crazy. Also, um... I'm afraid I called him a thief when I couldn't find my wallet. That didn't get me off to a very good start. No, I don't imagine it did. But the Captain's son, Dan, spoke up for me. So, I was offered ten and a half a month. It was work or I don't eat. I worked. You worked? Doing what? Well, I can handle a dory almost as well as Dan, and I don't get rattled in fog... much. I can steer in light winds, and I can bait up a trawl. Well, Dan, you know, taught me the most. And will I meet Dan? He drowned saving another crewman. I want to do everything I can for the Captain, and every man on that crew. Of course. I want to build a hospital. Here. A hospital? Dan's sister died of a ruptured appendix because there was no hospital. So, I want to build one. In memory of her and Dan. Yes. We can do all of that from New York. The limousine's waiting. There's... something important I have to do first. We are here this morning to honor the memory of those brave men of the sea, who, in the year past, gave their lives in pursuit of the calling that supports most of us. I will read their names in chronological order. Schooner Florrie Anderson. Lost with all aboard off the Georges. Reuben Pitman, master, 50, single, City. Schooner Gilbert Hope. Robert Bevin... Don't worry, Harv. Somehow, we'll work together. One day I'm gonna have a fleet of the new fishing boats. Haddockers, herring boats. I figured I'll call the first one Hattie S. Here. This is for you. Thanks, Dan. Best present I ever got. Partner? Partner. Schooner We're Here. Dan Troop, 16, single. Drowned when his dory, the Hattie S capsized during successful rescue of a fellow crewman. Schooner Marie Douglas. Mark Kelly, single... Harvey. Mr. Wade. I couldn't get my breath. Same here. All those names. That bell. I kept hearing Dan's voice. Harvey... What you're planning to do about the hospital, it means a lot to Mrs. Troop... and me. You and Dan did so much for me. Made me feel like I had a family. I know you two talked a lot. Had some big plans, he said. He wanted this fleet of fishing boats. Partners with you. "Dad knows fish," he said, but he don't keep up with the times." He said that, did he? He had it right. And... I sort of hoped I'd be part of it one day. Troop and Cheyne, I do like the sound of that, but... We could be partners? Together? I'll call Wade. We can start the boats right away. Hold up. Hold up. You're running on hurricane wind here. First for you, it's back and finish school, the same as it would have been for Dan. Get the best education you can, because you're gonna have some mighty big responsibilities. And to make sure you are doing your best, I expect a copy of your report card sent to me regular. Boys need to know that somebody's keeping close watch. How does that sound to you? Well... I wish I could skip school, but I've gotten used to doing as you say. Cheyne and Troop. Troop and Cheyne. So, is good I see you drifting and haul you in, yeah? Yeah. Manuel, tell your little girl in Madeira to stop crying. There's already too much saltwater out there. How am I gonna live without your fried pies? You will eat many more of them. When you're doin' all this learnin', learn some respect for farmers, the real salt of the earth. I'll put my shoulder to the plow, Uncle Salters. Get outta here before I gives you one. You take good care of yourself. I'll see you next summer. Thank you.
