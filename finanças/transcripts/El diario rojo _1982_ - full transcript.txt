THE RED DIARY With Music of Thanks to the collaboration of: For allowing us to film in their facilities. Written for the screen, produced and directed by Hello? Yes? Hello? It's Jaime. Do you remember? Jaime. What do you want? Can I see you? What for? To talk with you. It's been a while since we've seen each other. I'm married, and it's over between you and I. Why do you insist on it? Look for a new girl. Don't bother me. But I can't get over you. Look, it's not suitable for me to be with you. Sorry, but I've got a lot to do. I have to go now. Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. - Has Carlos arrived? - Haven't seen him around yet. - Are you starting on this? - Yes. Stupendous. So I can take a look at the paper. You want to piss off Carlos? Me? No, why? You know he likes it when people are prepared for when he arrives. Oh, but of course... Because if not, our idolized boss would be angry. Darling, stop being an idiot and get back to your spot. That pain in the ass would get pissed off anyway. You know that I took his girlfriend, who's now my wife? I know that, but remember: he can fire you if he feels like it. He won't. He still drools whenever he sees Ana. He won't get that displeasure. What are you doing tonight? Coming out to dinner? Are you treating? Of course. Don't I always... charm you? Kiss me. - Hello, miss. - Hello. Could you make me three enlargements? They'd be of a somewhat unusual size. One of 1 meter by 1.80, and the other two of 40 by 60. - Hello. - Hi, how are you? Hey, look... Yes, these are the negatives. Note the numbers up here. The first one's number 16. The second is 19. - OK. - And the third one's 24. - All right. - But I wasn't sure... - Will it take long? - From a week to ten days. All right, then. We had a good time. - Well, that's it? - Yeah, that's all. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. So, in the end, you didn't see him. No, I wasn't able to see him. - Deep down, he's a good person. - Yes, but he's tiring. I should telephone Ana to tell her I won't be there for dinner tonight. Does she suspect anything? She's been a little bit off. She can think what she wants. Shall we have some coffee? - Forget it. Shall we go? - Yeah. - How much? - Let's see... 500 pesetas. - Thanks very much. Bye. - Bye. Going by the tests, it seems that you're fine. Your case, nonetheless, is so delicate that I, personally, dare not say the final word. This x-ray, for example, indicates a fallopian tube obstruction. But, observing it closely and comparing it with this, one would arrive at the conclusion that such an obstruction doesn't exist, and that it's merely a narrowing. That this narrowing were the cause of sterility would surprise me. Sincerely, it's my opinion that you don't have any functional problem. If I knew in what conditions fertilization occurred... I've seen cases in which the diagnostic made it scientifically impossible to conceive. and, against all prognostics, it happened. So then, what do you recommend? Continue as you have done. And if nothing happens? Then have patience. Come back to see me after some time. Has your husband been checked out? No. Please bring him in for a consultation. Although it's less probable, it could be that the problem's with him. I've tried to convince him, but when I ask him, he gets annoyed. He says that he does his part, and that the rest will come in due time. He doesn't even know that I've come here to see you. He's so obstinate that, if he knew it, he'd get very upset. This happens sometimes. Some think that this affects their virility. Insist on it. Don't be discouraged. Meanwhile, take these pills to strengthen yourself. One each morning, on an empty stomach, with fruit juice, one before lunch and one before dinner. - Goodbye, doctor. - Goodbye. - Good evening. - Good evening. I've come to pick up the enlargements I ordered a few days ago. Yes. We received them this afternoon. Here you are. They're a bit large. Yes. Can I have a look at them now? No, no. It's a bit complicated to do it now. Fine, then I'll look at them at home. How much are they? Here are the negatives. Its... 5,200. 5,200. - All right. - Thanks very much. Bye-bye. I'm tired. Goodnight. Fine. Sleep tight. If you can, get on a plane and come to see me. As for the rest, we're in good health and everything is running as usual. Write me. I eagerly await news from you. Take care of yourself, and, in the meantime, you receive the pure affection of your daughter, who loves you, and won't forget you. Ana. Mrs. Laura Spencer. 197, West Hill Avenue, Epsom, Surrey, London, England. I am about to write the events that occurred yesterday. I have no intention of talking to anyone about this person, except for my mother, whom I've just written to, who got remarried to a foreigner, and who has lived in London for the past few years. It all started when someone knocked at my door and, under the pretext that he had come to offer me some products, quickly gained access to the drawing room, and, pouncing on me, made a violent attempt to rape me. Upon realizing that he was dead, my first reaction was to call the police. Then, I thought it would be better to call Juan. Although I was innocent, I had the feeling that both those things would complicate my situation. I had to find a better solution. I arrived at our little farm. It was rather humid. Because it wasn't summer, the surroundings were deserted. There was no one around, just as I'd imagined. Only the soft murmur of the woods, which made me uneasy. But I was calm. I didn't feel any guilt complex. Possibly because I wasn't to blame. And, curiously, I always had the sensation that everything that I was going to do would turn out fine. When I opened the suitcase, I was invaded by a faint fright. I had the sensation that the plastic hadn't resisted the pressure, and the bags had broken. Fortunately, everything remained clean, and the suitcase hadn't been stained. The remains didn't burn so well. Several times I had to rekindle the fire, helping it with gasoline. The bones didn't break down so I had to crush them up with a mallet. In spite of that, I managed to mostly reduce everything to ashes. Near the place where I'd deposited the ashes. some tall cypresses were growing that produced a hedge that hadn't been cared for. They appeared to be from a cemetery and bestowed an extraordinary peace to the scene. I couldn't but think that, by coincidence, that place had turned into a cemetery, and that he would enjoy the peace of his final resting place. "Requiescat in pace". Why worry my mother? Who can offer advice in a situation like this? I have magnificent news for you. Indeed, it's that you're pregnant. There isn't the slightest doubt. Please, sit. Now it's a question of making sure the pregnancy goes well. Don't smoke too much during this time. Don't take sleeping pills or tranquilizers. Lead a healthy life, but without going to excessive effort. Well, what do you think? It's what you wanted. Yes... it's what I wanted. You should feel happy. Very happy. What is it? What's wrong? Come, now. Calm down. Stop crying. - For the past four months. - But it was by penalty. No, we decided it quickly. - Do you live with your parents? - We've got a flat. Were you able to buy it yourselves? No, we couldn't. Our families got it for us. I assure you, I never would've imagined that of you. You see, they've caught me, and one day when you least expect it, it'll be your turn too. I'll never get married. That's what I said too. - But I say it seriously. - And why? I was in love with a girl, but she married someone else. But friend, is that all? Seems like little to you? But man, those things heal. Impossible. It could never be like that again. I'll never love anyone like I loved her. You'll see, when you meet a beautiful girl, how quickly you forget. But I have tried, more than once. And nothing worked out with any of them. Her image stays in my head, and I can't get it out. I assure you, it's completely impossible. Look, something similar happened to me a while back. It went pretty badly. You feel an emptiness, an anxiety. It's like a nightmare. Only he who has suffered knows. That's why I understand you. And how did you get through all that? I didn't do anything special. Just got on with my life, trying to think as little as possible. That's what I do, and it doesn't do me any good. It's possible that you live too closed off in yourself. Go out with other friends, distract yourself. If you do so, you'll notice that, little by little, her memory fades, until one day, you don't remember her anymore, and you're completely free. Let alone if you meet another girl you like. You'll see how the old one disappears. How can you be so sure? In reality, I can just talk about my personal experiences. I can't be sure that what happens to you will be exactly what happened to me. But I suppose that it will be, because, in this respect, people aren't so different from one another. I am sure that time erases everything, and that it makes you forget. Naturally, you'll never forget completely. But, the intensity of the memory is less as time passes. It's logical that it should be that way. Think for a moment how, if the intensity of the memory stayed just as it was on the first day, when a person died, one would never stop crying. But that's not how it goes. It could last longer or not, but everyone returns to their normal life. I sincerely confess, what you're saying encourages me a great deal. Naturally, you should have courage. And it will pass sooner if you spend time with others. Unfortunately, I barely meet anyone. I have few friends right now. Traveling could help you too. That'd be impossible for me. I'd have to leave behind my studies. Sign up for a tour company that organizes weekend trips. But on those sorts of trips it's only old people. I've had occasion to go, and there were people of all ages. Well, then I'll try it. I'd love to help you, but since I'm married, I've got more obligations and I'm more tied down. Nonetheless, on the weekends we can go. That's nice of you, but I don't want to impose. I understand, after working all week, you'd prefer to rest at home. What's more, I assume your wife would rather you be with her. Well, that happens some weeks, but others I'm more keen to go out. Why don't you come over to eat one day, and meet my wife? That way we'll exchange views. What's your wife like? Come over and meet her. I ask you because I'd like to know how you see her. She's a lovely girl, and with very good qualities. She even knows how to cook. I think I've been very lucky. Ana also knew how to cook. It's a quality you don't find too often. Not much importance is put on it, and all the time fewer girls know anything about cooking. I remember my father would say that certain arguments with my mother could always be settled by a good meal on the table. It's true. I've had occasion to find out how it smooths over certain situations. But women think that they're less equal to men if they know how to cook. We men should learn to cook just like women do. They should learn it in school starting from the first lessons. But that will never happen. Are you so sure? It requires a great mental effort and attitude to life. It's better for men to leave things as they are. You talk as though you were a feminist. I don't go so far as to be a feminist. The feminists, I believe, exaggerate. They're so locked into themselves that they come to create a war with men. Many of them reject marriage. With their intransigent conduct, they only manage to be, or are considered to be, tomboys. What's certain is, when I was a young twenty-something, I'd always thought there to be an equality between men and women. Because nobody had told me anything, and I guided myself by natural logic. That's why it surprised me to learn of things that established some differences with men that I noticed, and that to me seem unfair. Yes, I think that there's a certain inertia of many years, but in modern times, I think that things are changing rapidly. We were talking about you and we've ended up on feminism. What a mess, huh? My side's quite clear. And you, do you have any problems? Instead of problems, what I have are more like worries. Now that I'm married, I don't know how the future will develop, this shared life we have. I don't know if we'll continue together or end up badly, like so many couples. And there's this economic problem that we share together, and then later come children. You worry too much about things. I think it's premature to torment yourself with these ideas. It's possible, but it's getting late. I've got to go. Shall we meet again? Of course. Call me when you want to, and we'll go for a walk. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Get rid of all the documents that are on this shelf. Those older than five years, you can throw directly in the wastepaper basket. As for the rest, call the patients and let them know that they can pick up their analysis or x-ray within 15 days, and if they don't, we can assume they're not interested. And we'll proceed to destroy them. Because we have a necessity for space on this shelf. I'll locate the telephone numbers in the registry. It's possible that they can be found in the same document. If you don't find them, don't throw them out. Set them aside, and I'll work on it personally. Perfect, Doctor. All right. I'll go to the clinic. Hello. Anyone home? ...these images, which sometimes surface in dreams, that crop in up literary texts or in conversation and that, in some way, represent the repository of our personalities. That's why I think that the studies related to... - Hello? - Good evening, is Mrs. Hernández there? Yes, she's here. I'm calling from the office of Dr. Álvarez. We have some of her x-rays, and we wanted to know - ...if she could come and get them. - X-rays? Did something happen to my wife? So you're her husband? Yes, I'm her husband. What is the doctor's specialization? Gynecology. Could you give me the address of the office? Muntaner Street, number 60, top floor. Very good. I'll stop by to get the x-rays but I'd also like to talk to the doctor. If you'd like to, I'll give you the time. Yes, please. The 25th, at 4:30. I'd prefer after 6 PM. Then, how about the 11th at 6:30? The 11th of the following month? He couldn't do it any sooner? The time for the patients is at 3:30. You can stop by any Monday, Wednesday or Friday and try your luck. You can usually be seen at this time, because many are late until 4 or 4:30. I'll keep that in mind. Thank you. Hello. Mr. Hernández is here. Do you remember what we'd talked about? I suppose that you've come for the x-rays. What is it, Doctor? Your wife didn't tell you anything? About the visits to your office? Not a word. You two haven't had a conversation? About what? Is she sick? No, calm yourself. Your wife is in perfect health. But she can't have children. Isn't that right? Like I've already told you, your wife is in perfect health. What do you mean to insinuate? I find it very difficult to talk to you without the presence of your wife. I know what's going on. My wife, for a while, has wanted to have a child. She can't, and thinks its my fault. Lately, she's been very disturbed. I would also like to have children, but I don't understand this strange obsession. If she can have children, great. But if not... There are lots of people who can't have children. Of course, but as I was saying, your wife doesn't appear to have any problems in that regard. Are you trying to blame me for it? I'm not trying to blame you. Understand that in these cases, no one's to blame. What there's no doubt about is that your wife underwent an exam. You think I'm afraid of that exam? I want to show you all that I'm as normal as anyone. Therefore, I would appreciate being given an exam as soon as possible. My nurse will take down your data. But I want to be done with this matter as soon as possible. The examination can be performed tomorrow. In 15 days, you will have the results. That's fine. Tell me what I have to do. All right, come. Listen, Juan. I have something to tell you. I'm pregnant. I'm serious. It's certain. The doctors have confirmed it. The analyses don't lie, I assure you. - Dr. Álvarez? - Who may I say is calling? It's Mr. Hernández. It's very important. Mr. Hernández, tell me what it is. I just wanted to tell you that my gynecological exam doesn't interest me. My wife is pregnant. But... Send me the invoice. I'll pay whatever it is. Do you realize how right you were? You knew it. It was only a matter of time. Very good. Congratulations. If you want me to help your wife at all, I'm here. Naturally, we'll come back to you, Doctor. Have a good afternoon. - How much? - 1,000 and the bed. - Do you do oral? - Yes. My friend Escobedo, who goes out with you girls, explained that, first she'd do oral, and then when she was ready, he'd go inside. - Do you do that? - Sure. Well then, let's go. Where do I put the clothes? There, on the floor. Fine, on this chair over here. It'll be better if I wash. Where's the bidet? I don't see it. Behind the door. Ah, yes. Can I use this soap? Yes. But just use a little, because it makes a lot of foam. Do I use this towel? Yes, use it. You're not used to coming here, are you? No. It's the second time. The first time, I came with Escobedo and I did it with a Canarian girl at the end of the road. Which, by the way, was a total disaster. Look, I'm a person who, if you caress me like this, I get thirty times hornier than if you caress me like this, because I've got very sensitive skin. Therefore, do it the first way, do you get me? - Yes. - Go on, then. Why don't you give me a blowjob? What are you doing? Why rub it like that? You're wasting energy needlessly. A little touch at tip and it'll stand up right away. Pass me the condom. Can we do it with you on top and me on the bottom? No, I'm sorry. That's not my style of working. It's just that, these days my back has been hurting me. I've got lumbago. I mean it, I'm not lying. Nothing. I can't get it up. And also... I have to do everything myself. Wait. I have an idea. I'll give you oral and maybe that'll excite me. What's more, you'll see how much you like it. But that wasn't part of the deal. What deal? The deal was that I'd give the blowjob, then you would go inside me. The blowjob that you gave me was of no interest, and as far as penetration, nothing. That's your problem. That's also your fault. You don't stop giving inconveniences and prohibitions. Look, let's leave it. I'll give you 500 pesetas. You're not going to pay the 1,000 pesetas? Fine, you'll have the 1,000 pesetas but it'll be worse. Because you just lost a customer! All the better! But you didn't make me get hard. You could try doing your job well. Work! Here one comes to charge money and work as little as possible. - I know. - Half an hour washing yourself. It's not like you're in a hotel. What you wanted costs at least 5,000. Not for 20,000 would I do it with you, with what little charm you've got! - Mr. Hernández? - Yes. Dr. Álvarez would like to talk with you. - If you'd like, we can go by foot. - All right. Mr. Hernández, Doctor. Come in. Good day. Is there some problem? Don't worry. Please, sit. - Has she given birth? - Effectively. - Did it go well? - Yes, it did. - Is it a girl or a boy? - A boy. - How are the mother and child? - Both are fine. Of course, I would like to see them as soon as possible. A unique phenomenon has occurred in this case. The birth has been one of the calmest that I've seen. Just an episiotomy. Apparently, the mother hasn't suffered any pain, giving birth as though it were a real liberation. I don't see the problem. Allow me to finish. Generally, on performing the birth, the mother wants to hold the little one. In this case, she doesn't want to see him at all. She rejects him completely. Do you think it's serious? Did your wife, during the pregnancy, have any conversation about the child? I don't remember. I suppose it's normal in these cases. Don't you think the atmosphere of the clinic might be affecting her? Tell me what I should do. But right now I want to be by my wife's side. Of course. I apologize for the delay caused by this matter. Nurse, come to my office, please. I only want to suggest one thing: starting now, in the next few months, be very understanding with your wife. I suspect that she'll need you a lot. - You called? - Please accompany Mr. Hernández. - Bye-bye. - Good day. "All this indicates that Mr. Hernández is not fit for procreation. In the current state of medicine nothing can be done, which doesn't mean that in the future new methods might not emerge that could solve the problem." Do you have the time, please? It's 8:30. The train looks pretty from here. What are you doing? Hey! Ana? Are you going to explain to me what's come over you? Don't ask, don't ask. There are things that shouldn't be known. I don't understand what you mean. You're sick, understand? Pack up and let's go back to Barcelona. I'm not sick! So talk. What's going on with you? I have a right to know. I want to live peacefully. Don't tempt fate. We're playing with our happiness. Let's forget everything. It will pass. It all passes. You call "happiness" the attacks of hysteria you continually face me with? You owe me an explanation. You owe me an explanation. Put the flame of the lighter next to the paper. No! No! I'll destroy him. I'll eliminate him. Don't do it. He isn't to blame for anything. He's innocent. Don't you realize? He is only life. THE END CAST: WITH THE VOICES OF: THIS FILM HAS BEEN MADE ENTIRELY BY CARLES OLARIA
