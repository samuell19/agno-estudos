Hey sis, made it as quick as we could. We don't have much time. But. Yeah we'll we're being watched. There's two guys in a car across the street. Agency moves fast. We need to get her fed as soon as possible and... Hey pizza. Ooh, brains and liver. CHARLIE: Wait did Bill eat the pizza girl, she was cute. She was an orphan, don't worry about it. They'll be back and I'll be ready. Okay, machete boy, put that away. You said agents, what agents? There's only three types of people out there, now. One, the zombies, two, the agents who hunt the zombies. And three? The food, us, humanity, the food. Put that away. Fine, I'll do Bill, you do Carrie. What, the salami wasn't good enough for them? He tried, but all of the meats made him sick. I see. Okay well then he's advanced farther than I thought. See, the virus mutates his whole system until he becomes full zombie. I thought, well, I hoped that it would be a 72 hour cycle, but he's now progressed to the point where he can't digest anything other than human flesh.

College dropout, conspiracy blogger, fired by Best Buy for using store computers to hack the NSA. Is that where you got the big screen TV? Not the time Shell, super not the time. A lie is a lie Mr. Ford. Look I expose agents like you online every day. Alright so what's the lame name of your crappy black ops operation. I think he said FBI. I don't think he said anything. We didn't say FBI. Look, this right here, this is straight off an HP color printer, fake. So who are you guys anyways. Beat 'em. (electrical zapping sound) Which one you want me to start with?

Right, I mean Jesus, look at their weapon of choice. You know, Shell we probably don't have all that much time so I need you to think. Have you seen anyone who looks like those guys around the neighborhood over the last couple of days? You mean Mormons? Well. I thought you were done with those. Just two. And under the present circumstances, I think I have earned these. Think I've earned it too. (door rattling sound and faint growls) Apparently zombies have a hard time with doorknobs. Oh my god! Oh, I know what this is! They want an army of undead killers that you can't kill! All of the rumors are true. Man that taser really takes it out of you. Oh, you must be starving dear.

You know you guys are so cool for putting up with us. I gotta say when I was lying there, half electrocuted to death on the ground watching you devour that guy, it was uh... pretty gross. I thought you were amazing and strong and fast and oh my god please get that out of my face, that is a human brain. (crashing sound) Zombie, big one.

Let's get Carrie. Okay, we all know that the buzz in the chat rooms was aliens, then ISIS, then NSA, but everybody was wrong, it's you guys, it's zombies. This was your cover story, mad cow disease in Wyoming last month. One of you guys must've gotten out. Wyoming? None of us have ever been to Wyoming. Look, I was a vegetarian until Bill bit me, okay I mean the occasional double cheeseburger if I was drunk, but... a vegetarian. Okay, stay with me, I mean that a zombie got out or a lab tech was bit or whatever okay? But now it's spreading. You were bit, and then you bit her and then who knows how many the original bit. Okay whatever, what's the cure? There is no cure for dead. Then where are you going with this? You were right when you said Bourne dudes earlier, but imagine an army of Zombie Bourne dudes. Alright, no way, I'm gonna be an undead killer for anyone. Alright, I already served my country. I'm confused, I know we're zombies when we eat but now I feel normal. Cold, and a lot stronger, but normal.

Fine, where shall I bite first. (mumbling) Alright. It started when Baxter fed him late, the cell was open and Norris got out. (mumbling) Norris who? Edgar Norris, the prime, well... the second prime zombie. Youngstown, Ohio, the banker you ate. The zombie that bit me? The prime's name was Edgar. Yes well Betabrude's first prime was lieutenant Sullivan, but he escaped and bit the banker. And then you cut off Sullivan's head. Crushed in an industrial press. Huh. Schwarzenegger fan. (mumbling sound) So now you're the prime. The prime, the boss, the big cheese. You're the prime infect or. Ketchup stains are so brutal. They tortured me. She grabbed my...

We're gonna have to kill them. Maybe for the good of everyone, I should surrender and you guys can get your lives back. No, I will not let them turn you into some sort of a CIA Bourne of the dead assassin. Well then we're gonna have to run. I pay my taxes, this is my house, I am not going anywhere. Shelly, you're broke, you're halfway towards eviction, and this isn't going to cover four people on the run. What I mean is, that I am a US citizen, and I, we have rights. Are the dead considered citizens? Alright well then we're gonna have to make a deal. What kind of deal? In any negotiation, you wanna have bargaining power. Huh. Nobody knows we're here, their feed cycles almost up. We're lunch! You are a useless wimp. Oh my god, oh a little girl squeezed my tiny little penis. You have no idea how strong that female zombie was. You are a useless, you're a pinko, commie sissy. We need to talk to them and negotiate. You know they seem kind of nice. What are you, you don't negotiate with a zombie, you cut their mother f'ing heads off. How is that gonna help us now? Who's side are you on? I've got to get word back to headquarters. Alright, here's the plan soldier. What? (mysterious ambience) We let them eat you first, flail a lot, scream, distract them... Why do I have to... My molar is a transponder. Zombies can't digest teeth. Worst case scenario they track it back to the zombie scat pile. Best case scenario I find some metal and tap out a message back to base. Where are your keys? Oh, in my pocket. Okay. You're insane. Do you want to turn out to be a zombie? All right. Hold still soldier, I'm going in. (keys jingle sound) (door creaking sound) SHELLY: I leave you alone for five minutes, kinky. Hey guys, that's a no no. Now, we need to talk. In five minutes, this place is crawling with agents. You're dead, your family's dead, your... You are a very angry lady. Take the nice one to the den. I'm junk food, she's the tasty one. CARRIE: Come on lover boy. SHELLY: Okay secret agent man, you wanna live? Here's how it's gonna end. I am tired, hungry, and everyone else has eaten except for me. Now, I want my life back, and you're gonna help me. Now, we know who you are, we know what you are. Shelly, I'm not so sure about this. Let's just say the government does need an agent prime? Fine, who am I to argue with homeland security? We are just patriotic citizens, ready to negotiate. The agency doesn't negotiate. Okay then. Carrie, you do the honors, enjoy. (crunching sound effect) No, no I'll talk, I'll talk. We want off the grid. New social security numbers, new identities, fresh start. And no taxes. He has a point, paying taxes when you're dead isn't quite fair. We're not the IRS. And as long as Bill is dead, you will supply him with food for the rest of his death. Otherwise I can't guarantee his eating patterns. Brains, he likes brains. Morse is my captain, I can't. I mean if she even suspects I'm negotiating, I'm dead. Or a zombie. Or a lunch. Morse is tough as nails, but she's nothing compared to the hard ass agent we work for. If you take us out, they'll just send more. They'll never give up. They'll just keep coming. They're like zombies, only from the government. Alright fine, then he's lunch and the asshole in the bathroom is dinner. No, it's time for what they call in one of Bill's shows, a field upgrade. Upgrade, you mean a field promotion. That requires a commander in the field to be wounded or killed or... Oh. Baxter here is gonna be a hero. He is gonna save the country, win a medal, and earn a field promotion. Carrie.

You interrupted my meal, I would listen hard to whatever she says and yes, is the preferred answer. Relax Bill, it's Carrie's turn to eat. Baxter is looking a little stringy. I'll soften him up. You bastard... Hold your tongue or I'll do it with my teeth. (groaning can be heard in background) SHELLY: We're gonna let you go. We just have a few simple requests, and everybody's happy. You can say yes now. (growling sound effect) Yes. Good. Charlie, guard her while we go get everything ready. (thuds and punching sounds in background) I can still save him. Shut it G-man, G-woman. You haven't been bitten. Bill's gone, Carrie too, and your sister she's cracked, lost her mind. That's my sister. But we can save her, some therapy sure, there will be some scarring, painful.
