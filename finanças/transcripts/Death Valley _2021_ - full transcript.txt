Lockdown begins in 60 seconds. Lockdown begins in 30 seconds. Wait! No! Lockdown begins. Five, four... Three, two... No! Please, no! Please! Lockdown is in effect. Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Let me go! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Let me go! Lockdown in effect for 24 hours. The facility is under attack, and has been put into lockdown. I'm still inside. Everyone else is dead. If you want Adam and all of his research, get me out of here! In 24 hours, these doors will unlock and you'll lose Adam forever. Oh, come on! Oh, boy. Hey, babe. How's it going? Not good. I can't keep anything down. I started cleaning the nursery, and then I started on the crib, and now none of the bolts will fit into any of the holes. I'm pretty sure we're just having one. Wait, why are you in your gear? You're supposed to be coming home today. I know. It's just one more job. What? No. Hear me out, here, alright? No. This one job, it's going to pay for us to be able to buy a house in Kingston, alright? I'm talking about a nicer neighbourhood. This is going to be a better school, this is going to be better everything, alright? And it's all meaningless if you die out there and don't come back to us. Babe, I'm going to come back, I promise. How much is it? It's a lot of money. Marshall needs me for one more job, and then that's it, babe, we're done. I don't care what Marshall needs. You've told him, right? No. No, I haven't told him yet. You need to tell him. I need you to choose me over him. Oh, James! Please go home so I don't have to do to this anymore. I don't want to do it anymore. Mwah! If it makes a difference between you coming home or not, leave that one behind. Hey, when you going to tell him the truth, huh? You know that baby's mine. Fuck off, Junior! Okay! Alright, I got to go. Okay. Call me when you get back. I will call you the second I'm done, alright? I love you. So, what did you have to tell me? What? On the phone, Jess. She said, "So, did you tell him?" What did you have to tell me? Don't worry, I already know what you were going to ask. Really, what was I going to ask? You... You want me to be your daughter's godfather. Oh, good. Oh, she's back to being mine now? Okay! You were a father for all of two seconds. Hey, I'm just surprised you haven't asked me yet. You know, with all of my qualifications and whatnot. You realize a godfather has to be willing to make sacrifices, maybe give up their own life. You're not willing to die for anyone. Hey, dude, I would die for you. Junior, you have one redeeming quality, you're honest. Don't lose it. That's all you've got. Well, shit. And here I was thinking my only redeeming quality is that I'm an absolute beast in bed. Again, why are you lying? Why aren't you telling me, man? Alright, brokeback, couple's therapy's over. Let's go. Okay. It's nothing. Don't worry about it, aright? Let's go. You know, if it wasn't too inconveniencing, I would at least try and save you. Redeeming quality. Junior. Junior! Hey, we're going through another run through. Join us. What is there to run through? We save the pretty scientist, right? The pretty scientist falls in love with me, we make some memories, we have some laughs, she quits being a scientist to be the mother of my children. You forgot about the mini army that's invading the facility. Right, the angry militia that are trying to get in the front door, but they can't because it's nuclear grade? The ultimate cock block. Simple, we go in through the rear, sneak in through the back door. Hmm? No one knows we're there until boom, the fireworks happen. Marshall, you do realize that not everything is about sex, right? Everything is about sex though, Rach, except for sex, which is about everything else. Listen up. Eight hours ago, our benefactor, Samyaza Institute, received a distress call from one of their compounds in Bosvania. The compound is a bio-research lab that's on the cutting edge of unlocking the human genome. A hostile militia tried storming the compound, resulting in high civilian casualties. The compound is currently on lockdown, with enemy militia on the outside trying to break in. They have numbers, resources, and artillery. If alerted to our location, the artillery could end us before we even get started. They have men searching the forest for another way in, so it's important to be on high alert. The call came from the only surviving scientist. The mission is to enter the facility, rescue the scientist with the research, and exit undetected. Currently we have a team on the ground, and they found two escape tunnels. I will join Alpha, and enter the facility to locate the scientist. You two will join Bravo, Moses and Preacher, and cover our six. The mission is simple. Enter the compound without alerting enemy militia, and exit through the secondary escape tunnel. In 24 hours, a helicopter will arrive at our LZ for extraction. If you aren't there when it lands, you're walking out on your own. You know, just saying here, if we were offered a job, and my ex was the employer, I would let you know that vital information before we signed the contract. I'm just saying that I did say that. When? When did you say that? When I introduced you, and I said, "Hey, this is Rachel. We go way back." What? No, I thought you guys were stationed together. Like, you got positioned somewhere. Listen, dude, it's all good. Rachel's cool, okay? We ended the relationship mutually. Oh, that's good to hear. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck's this guy doing out here? This isn't good. It's okay. We're not going to shoot you. This is not okay. You don't have to run. He's going to run. There he goes, he's running. This is Bravo. We've been compromised. We've got a runner. I repeat, we have a runner. He's moving southwest. Move to intercept. Move to intercept before he alerts the enemy militia. Do you see him? Do you see him? Shut up. Shut up, or we'll kill you. Well, well, well. Becket, Marshall. We've been here less than five minutes, and already the enemy knows our position. Congratulations. You may have just killed us. Do you speak English? Alright, who wants to kill him? What are you doing here, kid? We don't have time for this. He has a metal detector. What do you think he's looking for, bottle caps? He's looking for the hatch. So, we tie him up. Listen kid, I don't want to hurt you, but I can't have you telling your friends where we are. Do you understand? Good. Now give me your hands. They're coming. The Nephilim's coming. Yeah? Well, we'll get him too. This is Alpha. We've entered the facility. Starting our search for the scientist. Going radio silent. See you on the other side. Alright, boys. Do your thing. Keep your eyes peeled. We don't know what we're walking into. Hey, Rach, something's not right. I don't like this. Hey, keep your hands up, and turn around. What the fuck? Incoming! Guys, move! Run! Guys, run! Fast! Move, move, move, move! Everybody, move now! Ah! Beck! Beck! Becket! They've got me pinned! Beck! Suppress your fire! Suppress your fire! Becket! Becket, they've got me pinned! Becket, They've got me pinned! Fuck! Fuck, this was exactly what we weren't supposed to do. Is Moses alright? He's gone. Beck, we've got to get out of here. This place is going to be crawling with militia. I got you, Preach. I got you. I'm with you. Shit, how is he? Looks like it's clean through. I need a couple minutes, but I can fix it. We don't have a minute, Beck. Let's go. Just keep an eye out, alright? Moses is dead, and he's staying here too. Let's go. Hold that for me, Preach. This is going to hurt. I see movement. You're going to be okay. He's not going to be okay. None of us are going to be okay! We are vulnerable out here in the middle of the woods. We need to - Alright, I'm not leaving, okay? If you want to leave, then do it, but I'm not leaving him behind. Yeah, yeah, I see you. Beck, we're out of time. There's a hole two feet right there. Preach, we're going to put you in that hole. We'll come back for you, yeah? Let's go. Alright, let's go. You can hide here. It'll be safe. They won't see you. I'll come back for you. They can't have gone far. Spread out, find them. Where are you? What do you see? Show yourself! I think we killed family. Come on! I have one here. Oh, shit. Don't move. I thought you said he was dead. Yeah, I thought he was dead. Surrender now, and we will kill you quickly. Spread out. Find them. They have a dog. Take the shot. You sure you want to start this gunfight right now? Take the shot, or he's dead. He's already dead, Becket. Take the damn shot. Fine. Cover my six. Here we go. There they are! Move over to the left. Marshall! There's only two of them. Cover me! Go around! Cover! Go around! Reloading! I got two magazines. We need to move, Marshall. Move, move! We got to get to the high ground. Last mag! I'm down to side arm. There's a ravine up ahead. We have to jump! What?! There's... There's a cliff! Cliff! Water! We have to jump! You want me to jump off a cliff? That's your best idea? Yes! Yes, that's the best idea. You got a better one? No, no, I like it, cowboy. Fuck me. Incoming! You find them? No. Downstream. It won't be long. Keep your distance. Let them lead us to the entrance. We will deal with them then. Junior, where are you? Hey, Beck. Over here. Fucking hell, man. So, Farmer Becket, what's the plan now? Beck? What? I'm thinking. Maybe you're thinking you should have killed that kid, huh? Pop, pop, we're in and out. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize we came here to kill kids, huh? Is that how you roll? That's how Marshall does it, huh? Kills kids, and fucking leaves his team behind? What are you even talking about? What do you think I'm talking about? You left Moses for dead, and you made me leave Preacher. Yeah, I thought Moses was dead. And as for Preacher, we gave him more of a fighting chance than they would have ever fucking given us. You can be mad at me when we get home. Yeah, if we get home. How far are we from Alpha? That river actually saved us some time. I imagine we're only a couple clicks out now. So, we follow the ridge line. If we're below them, we just carry on, and hope Alpha had better luck. This is it. This is where we enter. No, no, no, this is where we meet them. Well, they should have been here by now. Alpha's probably already come and gone. We can't keep waiting here. If those dogs catch us, we're done. What are you suggesting? I say we enter the compound, we meet up with Alpha, we exit where they entered, we haul ass from there. No, no, no. We move on to the pick up point. Listen, listen. We can't wait here anymore. Sooner or later, those dogs are going to find us, and when they do, we're done. Now listen, with any luck, they're not - Marshall! We can't keep outrunning them. Alright? We need to go where they can't. Trust me. This is our best option. Alright? Lead the way, James. Alright. You're sure this is the right way? Honestly, I'm not sure of anything right now. Those dogs are getting pretty close. We've kind of trapped ourselves in here. Yeah, well, let's hope I know how to read a map. I wouldn't trust you to read a book. Oh, shit. What? Shit. What is it? This doesn't make sense. I know it's supposed to be here. Well, is the map upside down? No, the map's not upside down. It's got to be... Is it? Hey! Junior! What? I think I found it. Huh? Get over here. Give me a hand. I think it's under the rocks. Okay. I hear you not want to talk. It's okay. I don't need you to talk. I need you to listen. See that man there? He don't like you. You killed his brother, and this is not good. He wants to kill you very slowly. If you help me, maybe I put in good word, and he kill you not so slowly, yeah? Who's in the bag? He speaks! His name was Vitae. You knew him? Not well. Once infection start, only can be stopped by burn. We have sealed main doors, and locked everyone inside, but there are other ways in and out. You want me to show you where the other entrance is. Yes! We were searching for them when you came and killed our men. We didn't shoot first. I don't care who start. Jonah, you care who shoot first? Yes, Jonah not care either. We need to work together. Open bag. Now you see why anyone trying to enter facility dangerous. This get out, kill everything. How do I know you're telling the truth? You don't. But truth right in front. Hey. You know that thing I was supposed to tell you earlier? Yeah. This is my last job. Tell you what, we get out of here, it's my last job too. Alright. Shit! The wall. That's convenient. Yeah. Where's the body? Ah. Let's hope these guns do us better than the last guy. Yeah. So, you and Rachel, why did you guys break up? You, you want to do this now? Yeah, I could use the distraction. She found out about my condition. What, you mean about your emotional immaturity? That's the one. Oh. That, and she said the sex was too good. Yeah, that's always a deal breaker. We should get going. It won't be long before they follow us. I'm more worried about what's already inside. There she is. What the fuck? Looks like they found something in the ice. Fuck the money, let's get out of here. Are you done playing detective, because you're just typing in random passwords. No, stop touching stuff! The expedition to recover subject N's body from the glacier was a success. But the human trials have proved devastating. The foreign blood acts like a parasite, and attacks the human DNA. A theory has arisen among some of the scientists that this specimen is the biblical species from the book of Enoch. And if so, maybe we should have left it in the ice. Maybe - Let me sum it up for you. Man plays God, and ends up creating the fucking Devil. Do you remember in Sunday school when they used to teach us about fallen angels and Noah's ark? I think I missed that day. The fallen angels raped the daughters of men, and they created this species of monster, called the Nephilim, that would wage war on mankind. Mankind had lost the battle, and they were on the verge of extinction when Noah built the Ark. God sends a flood, and he cleansed the world of the abomination. Yeah. I definitely went to a different Sunday school. It's just supposed to be a story, but... So, what, these guys found an alien in the ice, and they're trying to breed us with him? You pull the drives. Yeah. Dr. Chloe? Dr. Chloe? Dr. Chloe. Hey, Marshall. It's you from the past. You're in a bunker with a bunch of dead scientists, and maybe some kind of biblical species, so check your life choices. Drop the axe. Dr. Chloe? It's okay. Junior, I found her. It's okay. I'm going to get you out of here. You need to be quiet. They're attracted to sound. Oh, fuck. Junior, help! What the fuck are you? Beck! Becket! Oh, shit! What the fuck is that? Did we get it? What is this thing? You alright? No, I'm not fucking alright. They're coming. What? They're coming. What do you mean? There's more of them? We need to get out of here. Now. Yeah, okay, we need to go. Wait. Ah, shit. What's wrong? They're coming in. Who's coming in? You remember the bad guys on the outside? Yeah? Well, now they're inside. It looks like they're trying to seal us in. Anyone want to surrender? Surrender? They will kill you. They killed everyone. Yeah, we already met them on the way in. Fuck. What? It's right there. We can't go this way. I'm getting low on ammo. Yeah, I only have a couple left. Hey, I have an idea. Why don't do humans against non-humans? Hey, help me up here. Yeah. Oh, come on. I'm going to die, we're all going to die, you know that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all going to die. Let's go. Come on. Asshole. Does anyone else think it's weird that we're going into a vent when we just saw one go into a vent? No? I'm talking to myself? We've got to keep moving. It's right below us. We need to move. Doc, we got to keep moving. It's you from the past. You're in a bunker with a bunch of dead scientists. Shut that thing off! ... some biblical hybrids, so maybe think about your life choices. And you know what, check on the Becket's because - Where is it? Where is it? Go! Go! Ah! Keep moving, keep moving! Doctor, just move your ass. Let's go! Let's go, Beck! Come on! Move! Get out of there! Poke your head up, I swear to God. Come on, you son of a bitch. Show yourself. Are you good? Fuck! What the fuck are we doing here? Fuck. Fucking freak show down here. Are you good? Are you good, Dr. Chloe? Because we need some fucking answers! Oh, hell no! I've seen that before. Fuck. What are we doing here, cowboy? Just get me out of here. Please. We're not fucking leaving this room until you start telling us what's going on. They're genetic hybrids. Hybrids? Hybrids of what? Part human, part... Something else. What's the something else? We called it Subject N. We extracted its blood, and made Adam with it. Can we go now? This was that Nephilim shit you guys were talking about outside. Oh, God. What the hell's wrong with you people? You find someone in the goddamn ice, you leave it in the goddamn ice. Here's what we need to do. We need to find the other service entrance. We go in through medical, into engineering. Hopefully along the way we find Alpha. No, no, no, no. What now? I am not going down there. Like hell you're not going down there. Why? Why don't you want to go down there? That's where Adam started it all. And I just spent the last 20 hours getting as far away from there as possible. How many of these things are there? This facility has 22 employees. How many do you think are infected? All of them except one. You're the one, right? You're the one that's not infected? Wait, these things are fucking people? These are your people? Maybe they're killing each other. There might be less of them by now. They don't attack their own. That doesn't change anything. We still need to go down that way. The facility is on lockdown. You couldn't go down there if you wanted to. We need to go up. What is wrong with you? We can't go back up. The militia are up there. They followed us in. Why did you lead them to the entrance then? Who are you guys? Oh, that's nice. Thanks. Nice to meet you too, okay? Your calvary that you sent a little message to, your special ops team? They're dead, and we're not. And you're in the shit. So, we're going down there, with or without you. The intel says there's another tunnel that leads out. We find it, we find Alpha, and we get out of here. Are you good? I'm fine. Sounds like they killed it. Or maybe it killed them. I think this is it. Alright, who is this Adam, huh? Why is he so important? Adam was the first successful hybrid created 30 years ago. He was moved here for containment when he became unstable. You guys put him in containment? Come on, Beck, how you doing? Working on it. Subject N's DNA had adverse effects on adult DNA. The only way to merge the two genetic strains is an embryo. Well, great, so he's a test tube baby. So, what happened to him? Did you just hear? He didn't get breastfed enough. Nobody asked if he was okay with being a science experiment, and he snapped. That's what happened. Okay. Moral of the story, you have to have consent. Got it. Hey, hey! Stop right there! Drop the gun, and put your hands up! Do it, and do it now! Now to the wall! Move it! Move it now! Let's go! We're not alone in here. No shit, we're not alone in here. There's something alive down here, and it's not human, okay? We can team up. No more talking! Just keep your voice down. The next one of you who speaks gets a bullet between the eyes. I only need the girl. The rest of you, I could kill right now. Fuck. I'm just spitballing here. The next time you send out a distress call, maybe mention there's a fucking monster in here with you. Having known that, I would have prepared differently. If you knew, you wouldn't have come at all. You got that right. So, was that Adam? Hey, was that Adam? No, Adam is dead. Olek killed him. Olek? Who the hell's Olek? He was in charge of keeping Adam contained. Oh, wow, huh? Plot twist. Caregiver kills the patient. So, why is he sticking around? He wants to weaponize Adam's research, which I have. Oh, she has the research. That's a little bit of information that'd be nice to know ahead of time, doctor. What's the plan if we get out of here? Helicopter picks us up, and we leave this place like a bad memory. Okay, we need to follow the water line to the hatch. Where did you get this map? Let's go! Sprinkler, sprinkler. You guys, I have some more. Which red pipe? This whole room is red pipe. I think it's this one. Main... Why do they make the doors so small? Alright, what's next? The next hatch is at the end of this level. Okay. That's simple enough, yeah? Let's go. Shit. We've got a problem. Yeah, seven feet tall, likes to kill for fun? Doesn't talk much, has a thing for you? Unless you're talking about the redhead, 'cause I cancel my dibs. We're going to come out on the wrong side of this mountain. We're not going to make it to the LZ on time. Okay. Uh, we'll find Alpha, make sure he has a sat phone, call in a different extraction point. What happens if we can't find your friends? I think I should lead the way, yeah? Yeah, well, I've got the map. I should stay in front. Okay. Besides, you have the gun. What does that mean? Lockdown's over. Hey, Rach, huh? How are you doing? Help me get her vest off. Careful. Hey, hey, you're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. Hey, you're going to be fine, huh? Yeah, yeah, we found her. We found the scientist. We're going home. It's going to be fine. What's happening to her? She has a laceration in her lower abdomen. Guys? Oh, fuck. Okay, guys, we've got to move. We've got to move. Rach, we're going to - She can't. She can't. What do you mean? Okay, okay. It's going to be fine. Huh? We're going to get you home. Can you help us, please? It's too late. Once you're infected, there's nothing you can do. The hell there isn't! Help her out! She's turning. Hey, can you wake the fuck up and help her? There's a medical ward down the hall. Find a stretcher we can use to carry her out. Okay. Okay, hey, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. We don't have time. I'll be quick. Everything's going to be fine. Hey, I got this. Go find us the way out. Okay, just keep pressure on the wound. I'm going to look for the next hatch. You're going to be fine. Hey, everything's going to be okay. Hey, it's going to be okay. It's going to alright, yeah. It's going to be okay. I'm sorry. What the hell did you... What the hell did you do? I helped your friend. Rach. You put a bullet... You put a bullet in her head. Once the blood is in, you can't stop it. Your friend was turning. She was in pain. You fucking killed her. I stopped her suffering. Hey, just take it easy. Tell me why I shouldn't fucking kill you, right here, right now, huh? Stay calm. I knew what was happening to her because I've seen it happen again and again to my friends. This isn't the time, alright? We can deal with this later, but right now we need to get going. Yeah, well, I say we put two in the fucking scientist and move on. Hey, hey. Nobody else has to die. Listen. You don't get to talk! The person you cared for is gone. The longer we stay here, the more dangerous it is for you. Do you hear that? They're going to be through that door any second. We need to get out of here. Move. No, I'm not moving. You're not thinking - Move the fuck out of the way. No, just take one second and think - Move! What the hell's wrong with you? What the hell's wrong with me, huh? What the hell's wrong with you? I'm trying to save our lives. Save our lives, Beck? We wouldn't fucking be here if it wasn't for you! What, like this is my fault? Yeah, it is your fucking fault! If you had let Moses kill that kid in the woods, we would have been in and out. But no, you're too much of a fucking bitch to pull the trigger! It's here. How, huh? How's it following us? How are you doing this, huh? Enough! I'm right fucking here! Let's end it! Come on, show yourself! Fuck you! Come on, let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Come on! Come on! Where's Junior? I don't know. Junior, can you hear me? Oh, what the hell are you guys doing down here? Come here. Oh, you bitch. Oh, shit. He's right here. Shut him up. It's going to hear us. Pass me the knife. I'm sorry. I need to use your house. Thanks for having me, man. There's something out there. Junior, Junior can you hear me. Beck? Shit. Beck, I'm in the morgue. Beck, I'm in the morgue. Where are you guys? We've got to block the door! Ah! Ah! Junior, we need help! Junior! Thanks, buddy. Got to go. Beck, Beck, I'm stuck in the morgue. Come on! Come on! Come on! I'm not going to die in here. Let's go. Junior! Junior! Junior, we could use the distraction! Ah! Oh, fuck you, dude. Why did he leave? I don't know. Ah! Ah! Shit. Olek's men are here. Eventually they're going to catch up to us. Oh, great. So, we have a tape recorder and a knife. Shit. Ah! Check on the Becket's, especially around the holidays. That Sunday school story? They might be in a cult. And last thing, be okay with Becket. He's got a kid on the way, and you're happy for him, so don't take it personally. And as for you... You have been corrupted, huh? Good. This is justice. You killed my brother. Prepare to die, right? That's the line? Princess Bride? Ah. You dropped this. Thanks. You know how to use one of those? I'll figure it out. Let's go fry these bastards. Stop. What? You need to get me out of here. Yeah, right after we get Marshall. No. If Olek gets this research, he'll turn it into a weapon. And if that happens, we're all dead. Where is Adam? Who's Adam? You don't know? It spreads fast, yeah? You can feel it. It changes your body. It also brings truth. What do you want? To watch your soul disappear. What are you talking about? It is very painful, yeah? First it burns. Your blood will boil, feel like fire. And then you'll see things, memories that aren't yours. You will die, and come back, reborn as Nephilim. Whatever you're on, dude, I'd love just a little taste of it, huh? Huh, just give me a little. Give daddy some. Just put it... You're a funny guy, huh? I promise you, I promise you, that won't last. But if you tell me where Adam is, I will put you out your misery. I already told you. I don't know... I need some help here! You can't keep me in here. You can't keep me in here. When he's back... She. I know, I know, I know. We will deal with her. And now, you knowing truth has set you free. So, please. So, this is Adam's room? Yes. This is where they kept him. He was here the whole time. Oh, God! At least we found Alpha. Oh, I think I'm going to throw up. Junior, can you hear me? You seem like weak man, yeah? I will spare you what happens next. Junior! Nothing's getting through this concrete. There should be a sat phone somewhere. It still works. Alright, I want you to follow this tunnel all the way to the top. You're not coming? When you get to the surface, press this button. They'll come find you. Thank you. Can you tell me that story about Adam again? What? Why, we don't have time? Oh, I think we have time. Why don't you tell me the story about Adam, the one where he's kept down here his entire life, and then he kills his captors so he could escape. Why don't you tell me that story again? What are you talking about? My wife is twelve weeks pregnant. She's been puking since the start. Now, I thought you were just sick, or maybe it all this blood, or it was this fucking creature chasing you. But then I see this! Why would Adam have a crib in his room? You're scaring me. How far along are you? You're scaring me. Don't you lie to me! Don't you fucking lie to me. Oh! Oh, God! Oh! How far along are you? I'm about the same as your wife. You fucking played us this whole time. Do you have any idea how many people died trying to save you? What would you have done if you were in my place, with only pictures of the real world, and an empty promise that one day you'd be set free! I wasn't going to let my son be raised in this place. So, what, you just killed them? Not all of them. And the distress call? My money? Just the carrot at the end of a stick to get us to come rescue you. Why? Why wouldn't you just tell the truth from the start? You know, I want to believe that you're a good person. But you lied. Why? Oh, I'm sorry. Let me try this again. Hi, I'm Chloe. I was made in a lab, been locked down here for 30 years, and I killed my captors. Will you please rescue me? Is that what you wanted? In my experience, people only care when they have something to gain. So, I guess the real question is... Will you let me leave? I get why you did it. I'd do anything to save my kid. But that's why I can't let you leave this room. I have a daughter now, and your blood... That's too dangerous. Come on. You're a good person, Becket. I'm sorry that it came to this. I'm not going to kill you, but I'm not letting you leave this room. Marshall was right, you don't have what it takes. Sometimes to beat the monster, you have to become the monster. Hey! Drop him, ugly, or your girlfriend gets it. Move again, the next one's in your head. I hate to break it to you, Beck, but she's been lying to us. Thanks for the heads up. You kill me, and he will rip you apart. Don't you know? I'm already dead. Olek. Please don't. I never meant for you to get hurt. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. You were going to change everything. Now what you've done cannot be undone. I am going to change everything. But I'm doing it my way. Ah! You know, it didn't have to be this way. I was going to let you live, but you couldn't let me leave. I will give your daughter the same gift that was given to me. She will bear my son's seed. Hey! Oh! Is she dead? Yeah, she's dead. What are we going to tell people what happened here? Well, we're going to say it was your idea to come. Hey, do I get to be your daughter's godfather now? What? You said I have to be willing to sacrifice, right? Well, I think I just saved the whole world. Does that get me in? Yeah. Yeah, you're definitely in now. So, you're going to get up, or do I got to drag your ass up this ladder? I'll tell you what, you go ahead. I'm just going to rest here for a little bit longer. Come on, that's alright. Let's go. I'm not going anywhere, Beck. I'm infected, man. That's why we're going to get you help. There's no help. There's no cure. The hell there isn't. Alright, I'm not leaving you down here, so let's go. Alright? The helicopter's here. We need to get going, so give me your hand, and let's get your ass up this ladder. They had her locked up down here for a reason. There's no cure. You don't know that. I know you want to save me, man. But new mission, get you home. Hello? Who is this? James? Is that you? James? Hello? James, are you there? James? Is that you? Talk to me, James! We have someone over here. Pull it in.
