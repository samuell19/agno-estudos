[wind blowing heavily] [eerie music] [helicopter blades whirling] [dramatic music] [horn honking] [dramatic music] - Wasn't expecting you til tomorrow. Tommy Shivers. - Hickock. - I'm sorry we had to do it like this Captain Hickock but, we was blowing so damn hard down in the canyon, the bird just couldn't land there. [engine revving] Something must be up there. Coming all the way out here to check on this mess. - No. Standard procedure with research related deaths. - Yeah well just between you and me, I'm real glad you're here. - Why? - Let's just say I think Old Van Fleet, and his bunch of eggheads, has been down in the hole too long. Leave it at that okay. [water trickling] [engine revving] [water trickling] This way Cap. I hate it when it blows like this. [door scraping] [rattling] It'll make it. - Great, yeah. [banging] - This place was something back in the 50's. My old man was a maintenance engineer back then. Shit that had maybe, a whole 2000 working down here, on the platoon gun. But ever since they shut down in '62, things just went to hell. It's too big a job for me to handle by myself. - I imagine. - God damn piece of shit. - Welcome to Project Shadowzone Captain Hickock. Get his bag. I'm Dr. Erhardt, Dr. Van Fleet's assistant. Are you hungry captain? [forks clanging] I hope the food's okay. - It's fine. - I'm really sorry that Dr. Van Fleet and the others, couldn't join us. But they're working late tonight. - Well when we're finished here, I'd like to meet them. I'd like to see the body also. - Of course. Tell me something. How long do you expect this investigation to take? - Why? Is there a problem? - Well we, I mean Dr. Van Fleet is right, in the middle of a very delicate phase. And he's concerned about when, he can start the tests up again. - Well it depends. - On what? - On what I find. - Hey Cutter, what's for dessert? Cutter! [banging] - Bon appetit. - Jesus Christ. - That's dessert you lazy hillbilly dipshit. Two weeks, two weeks I've been asking to seal up, them air vents in my kitchen so the rats can't get in. - Well I said I'd do it. You ain't the only damn thing, I gotta take care of around here. - You've got 24 hours or else. - Or else what? - After that, I'd be real careful what I ate if I was you. - I apologize for Mrs. Cutter Captain. She used to run the whore house over in Nigh County, and I think that left her a little bent. - Bent? She's a goddamn psycho son of a bitch. [steam hissing] - [Hickock] What happened here? - Well everything beyond here collapsed from earthquake. - So how long have you been working with Dr. Van Fleet? - Five years and before that I was my husband's assistant. - Yeah. - Well he died. - I'm sorry. - Oh don't be. I'm not. [animals crying] - Oh sorry about all the noise. I haven't fed em. They get a little freaky when they're hungry. - Captain Hickock, this is Dr. Kidwell. - Nice to meet you. - Captain Hickock is the NASA man we've been expecting. Hey don't. We've been expecting. - Great. Bingo calm down. - He's come to see the body. - Are these animals used in the test? - In the early stages before the human subjects. - Now they've just become expensive pets. - It's a weakness of mine. I always get attached to my lab animals. - I can see why. [animals crying] - The body. [heals clicking] Are you okay? - I just wasn't expecting. Who cleared the autopsy? - He signed a release. We make all our test subjects sign one. - Who was he? - Just a man who answered our ad. I think he was in a security at a casino in Vegas. - Any family? - A sister somewhere in the east but, we haven't been able to contact her yet. - It won't be 100% until the tests are complete, but I'm pretty sure it was a stroke induced, by a cerebral hemorrhage. [monkey screeching] - For God's sake. [monkey laughing] - I'm sorry. Bingo. - What caused it. - Could be anything. CM is a condition just waiting to happen. This one popped in his premotor cortex. [buzzing] - Could it be related to the project? - We're on our way. There's absolutely nothing to indicate, that this is project related. - Certainly not primary. It's usually a genetic breakdown and, not a systemic result. - That was Dr. Van Fleet. He's expecting us. [door banging] [keys clicking] Wiley this is Captain Hickock. - Welcome to Hell Captain. What? I wasn't talking to you. Our guest is here. [keys clacking] Okay, sleeping beauty's moving out of REM, into the first level. Okay I'll tell her. Hey airhead. The old man wants to see you down in Never Never Land. - Come this way. [keys clacking] Put these on. We use ultraviolet light to keep fungus, and bacteria from growing in the lab. [banging] Oh don't touch anything when you're inside Captain. [door scraping] - Jonathon Van Fleet. You must be Hickock yeah. - Yes sir. I apologize for not meeting you but, this whole nasty business has, how do you say, thrown a ratchet monkey in the machinery. [giggling] - Monkey wrench. - Means the same thing. - Well, I'll leave you two. - Yes go, go, we'll be just fine. - Please don't keep him long Captain. It's getting late and he needs his rest. - He promises now just leave us alone. [door scraping] Bit of an overbearing creature isn't she. - A little stiff. [chuckling] - Best assistant I ever had though. Works like a dog. I think all she needs is a good. You know. [laughing] She's beautiful isn't she. My sleeping beauty. Her name is Jenna, Jenna Shou. Shou in Chinese means longevity. She came to us just a few days ago. A replacement for, poor Mr. Harkons. You like her yeah. [chuckling] Come, come Hickock. This, this is James. He has been with us for about, six months now. - They look dead. - In a way they are. It was a Greek poet Hesiod who, characterized sleep as the brother of death. But what you see, here is extended deep sleep. The result of, severing the cortex from the lower brain stem. - You cut their brain stems? - Relax Captain, not in the manner you imagine. It's all done electronically and, it's quite safe. - Can anything wake them? - Not unless their cortex is reconnected. - Amazing. - It's an old concept. Back in the 40's neurologists they, experimented by physically cutting the cortex's of cats. It's taken us all these years, to perfect a method, which would not leave the subject brain dead. - Could this have been responsible for the subjects death? - Impossible. - Why do you say that? - Test results have indicated, no damage to the brain or nerve tissue. That man simply had a cerebral hemorrhage, such things happens thousands of times every day. Why don't we continue this tomorrow Captain. It's late and I'm rather fatigued. - Of course. Oh Doctor, would you mind if I took a look at the, computer analysis from the test the night the subject died? [dramatic music] - Be my guest. I'll have Wiley punch it up for you. Sleep well Captain. [dramatic music] [door banging] [dramatic music] Were you listening? - You really think it's a good idea, to give him the max system printouts? - Their information won't mean anything to him. Besides I don't want him sensing any reluctance on our part. [eerie music] [paper shuffling] [eerie music] [shushing] - There's something I think you should see. [eerie music] - What the hell's this all about? - You'll see. Just keep your mouth shut. [banging] Follow me. Come on. [eerie music] [whistling] [eerie music] [whirling] [whistling] [beating] - Are you hungry Captain? [heavy breathing] [mellow music] [bird cawing] [coyote howling] [eerie music] - Why didn't you tell him it was out of the question? - I did, he wouldn't buy it. - I warned you. - Listen, research deaths have to be reported. It's Federal law. You can't just-- - The men who make those laws, find ways to circumvent them everyday. Just relax, I will handle it. - Okay and what is this section? - This represents the EDS levels. - What seems to be the problem Captain? - There's no problem. I just want to see the test, that was run the night the subject died. - It's not advisable. - Are you telling me it's not safe? - It has nothing to do with the test. It's just that the subjects, have been in the eggs for almost 72 hours. And that's the maximum we like to keep them there. - According to the printout, it takes less than five minutes to reach the EDS level, the subject was at when he died. [sighing] - You don't understand. - Excuse me Doctor. You don't understand. We're under both this experiment, because of it's potential use in space flight. But you've got a dead test subject here, and your funding is in deep shit. - But I already explained to you, that the unfortunate death is unrelated to the tests. - Well unless you can prove it to me, I'm gonna recommend that the project, be suspended further investigation. - This is insane. You're gonna throw away years of work-- If he wants proof, he will have it. Wiley, bring the male subject to level 31. - Sir? - Do it. [keys clacking] This shall not take long Captain. - Do you mind if I watch the subject up close? - Whatever it takes. - Thank you Doctor. [eerie music] - This is very dangerous. - We have no choice. - Yes sir I understand. [sighing] Alright. He says to tell you that the EDS level, are displayed on the digital recanter. - Thanks. [eerie music] [whirling] [keys clacking] [clicking] - How far can we take it? - I don't know. Entertaining the face of game, we could be shit out of luck. [dramatic music] - Program the application to hold at level 31, that should be safe. [keys clacking] [beeping] - That looks like he's trying to talk. - Involuntary REM movement. We've always seen it in deep sleep, now we know it appears in EDS also. [dramatic music] [beeping] - Let me talk to Van Fleet. Doctor, the print out say that the test was taken to level 31 F? - A through Z are sub levels captain. They're importance is insignificant. - I'd like you to take it to level 31 F please. - We can't. - We must. - What happened, could happen again, only worse. - How long was the subject in 31 F, before we started to loose control? - 35, 40 seconds. [dramatic music] - 31 F it is Captain. [dramatic music] - I hope you know what the fuck you doin. [keys clacking] [beeping] [dramatic music] - Excuse me Captain. - Sure. - 10 seconds. 15 seconds. - Damn. Make haste my friend. [dramatic music] - The last time it was an accident. You let the subject die this time, and it's murder. - DOn't start up with that again. - Shut up, both of you. - 25. 30 seconds. [dramatic music] - There's a rise in the heart rate. - Substantial? - Negative. - Nothing to worry about. - [Wiley] 40 seconds. [dramatic music] - What about the other life signs? - Normal. - 45. - What the hell is he doing in there? - Making life difficult. [beeping] Come on Hickock. - Thank you Doctor. - Oh thank God. - Bring him back. Bring him back Wiley. [keys clacking] [sighing] [eerie music] [keys clacking] - Oh shit. - What is it? - We're interfacing again. - What? Terminate it. - I can't. Something's overriding the program. - That's impossible. [keys clacking] - Son of a bitch. - [Erhardt] What does it mean? - It's coming out of the darkness. [eerie music] [alarm blaring] - His heart rate is a 114 and runaway, so are his life signs. - What's going on? [keys clacking] - Do something! - What?! What do you want me to do?! - Dump the memory. Terminate the whole thing. - He can't. The program is bulletproof. - Will somebody please tell me, what the hell is going on here? [alarm blaring] [air rushing] [rumbling] [exploding] [glass shattering] [alarm blaring] - What in the hell are they doing now? [alarm blaring] - What happened? - A slight malfunction. That's it. - Computer crash. [alarm blaring] - She's okay, our backup power source kicked in. - What about the girl? - Hang on. [alarm blaring] [keys clacking] Her egg's online but she's in trouble. Kidwell, Kidwell and I will go in. Kidwell. - You better dress for it, the dioxide and anomia lines are ruptured. - I'm going with you. [alarm blaring] [air hissing] - [Van Fleet] Wiley can you hear me? - Loud and clear. - [Van Fleet] We are going in. [keys clacking] - Okay be careful. The place is full of lethal toxins. - [Van Fleet] How is the girl? - She's stable. But we have a problem in the unit. - What problem? - [Erhardt] We can't modulate the levels in any dream mode. - What the hell does that mean? - We can't wake her up. We will bring her out with the portable LSS, until you can work out the bug. [water dripping] Okay. - [Kidwell] I'll get the LSS. - ÷{Van Fleet] She appears to be alright. - She's healthy in here. - [Van Fleet] We will put her on the LSS now. - What's it like in there? - [Van Fleet] All the feed lines, on the alpha egg are ruptured. The system appears to be destroyed beyond repair. - Well what about the omega lines? - [Van Fleet] Minimum damage. The bug must be at your end. Are the monitors operating? - Negative. The video circuit in the inner lab was blown. - Wait a minute. [keys clacking] Okay I'm gonna try you on the heat sensors. [clicking] Alright I got you on the heaters. [air hissing] [water dripping] - [Van Fleet] We are moving her into the airlock now. - Hey check this out. No, no, no, hold on. [beeping] - [Erhardt] What is it? - I don't know. Let me check this out. [keys clacking] [eerie music] Oh shit. - What is the problem? - John Doe. He's come to visit. - [Hickock] Who is John Doe? - What's he doing? [water dripping] [eerie music] - Wiley. Where is it Wiley? - Its about 20 meters away over by the oxygen racks. You should be able to see it. - I can't see it but, I'm going to move towards it. - I think you should wait, until we can analyze the situation. - I fear Dr. Erhardt, my days are to end inevitable. - Who the hell is John Doe? Somebody answer me goddammit. [eerie music] [air hissing] [laughing] Now I see it. It's steam. - He's close enough to reach out and kiss it on the lips. - You're there Doctor. - Let me see you. [eerie music] Madam Pip. [screaming] Help. [banging] - That's John Doe. - Captain I think the first - What the hell could do - Something like this. - thing we have to do. That steel has got to be that fucking thick. [talking at once] - Quiet. - I've ever seen anything like that before. - Shut up. Let her finish. - By taking subjects beyond, normal levels of dream state sleep, we discovered that the subconscious acts like a radio tuner. - Well that ain't no rock and roll tune, banging around the lab. - No it isn't. It's a highly intelligent being. - She's nuts. - Listen to me you moron. - I don't need you calling me no names. - Sit down. - We have always theorized, that outside stimuli woke the brain from sleep. But its not so. Van Fleet proved that the brain also wakes itself, as a defense mechanism. - By breaking down the natural boundaries, of the sleep state, we discovered that a parallel dimension exists. And the human brain is capable of perceiving it. - Communication was the first stage. The subject interfaced with John Doe, and the computer acted as interpreter. - So how did this, this thing get here? - I don't know. - Are you buying all this shit? Son of a bitch. - I'm getting the fuck out of here. - Fat chance. Only way to the top's sealed shut. - Well open it. I gotta, I, I got a date at the Tropicana. - I can't. The main airlock works on a safety system, that they installed in the 60's, to make sure that no radio activity leaked out, in case of an accident. I mean they got sensors all over the place. - This thing is radio active. - Very minimal. - Well enough to keep the airlock shut, tighter than a bull's ass at fight time. Long as that thing is here, so are we. - What about the com lines? - The ones to the outside are down. The main transformer must be blown. - Great. - [Wiley] Hey, I think y'all better get back to the lab. - [Hickock] Are you positive? - Look I've checked and triple checked the entire system. There's nothing there. Whatever was in the lab is gone. - It's impossible. The walls, the ceiling, the floors are solid lead. There's no way out. - Except for the water drain. - What drain? - The one you had me cut in the floor, way back when you moved in. - Where does it go? - Into the main system. - How the hell could something big enough, to put dents in that steel plate, escape through a water drain. - I had the computer analyze, the organism's chemical structure. Check this out. - The mass density ratio changed. - That's right. This thing can expand and contract, it's molecular structure at will. Become any size, any shape it wants. - Jesus. - What an incredible intelligence. - Well fuck how are we gonna kill it? - We're not. - We better. - Can it get in here? - Well the airlocks are vacuum sealed. I don't think it can get that small. - Then we're safe in here. - Yeah for the time being, but unless we get the main transformer operational, we're gonna run out of air in a few hours. - Oh shit. - You don't have any contact, with the outside on a daily basis? - No, we're completely isolated. That's the way Van Fleet wanted it. - Shivers what about cutting through the main airlock? Can we do that? - It's eight inches of lead and steel. - Well, then we'll have to fix the transformer. - Well then what? - I have to make contact by tomorrow morning. If I don't, they'll check up on me. - Well I ain't going out there. I don't know jack shit about fixing no transformer. - I can handle the transformer. - Alright okay. I'll go with Wiley. Shivers, you go to the kitchen, and bring back Mrs. Cutter and some food and water. - That damn thing might be out there. - I'll go with you. - Well what the Queen of Shiva here huh? - Someone has to stay here, and change the LSS pack on the egg. - Can you wake her yet? - Not until the computer isolates the bug, in the egg system and, can't cross reference on auxiliary power. - How long do the packs last? - An hour. But I've only got two left. [shuffling] - What do you think that's gonna do? - Blow it's fucking brains out. - You're more likely to shoot your foot off. [eerie music] [paper rustling] [eerie crying] [eerie music] [screaming] - Did you hear that? - Hear what? What? - I thought I heard the monkey screeching. - Fuck the monkey. - I'm gonna check on them. - What? - I'll meet you back in the kitchen. - Wait a minute. [air hissing] [eerie music] [eerie screaming] [eerie music] - Captain. Let's go. [eerie music] [electricity zapping] [eerie music] - That's it. [electricity zapping] [eerie music] [cat meowing] [eerie music] - What's the matter guys? What is it? [sighing] [eerie music] What are you afraid of Badger? Huh? You afraid of? - [Kidwell] Shivers it's Kidwell. Can you hear me? - Don't answer it. - What's wrong with you? Talk to her. - I don't wanna. It's just gonna be trouble. - It's Cutter. We're getting the food together. What do you want? - Bingo got out of his cage. He might have gone your way. Tell Shivers to look around for him. - I'll tell him. - I gotta help you with the food. - Well I can handle this. You look around for a monkey. I'll meet you at the elevator. [clanging] - Damn. [shoes clicking] [scratching] [eerie music] [eerie music] - Bingo. Where are you boy? [air hissing] - Looking for a monkey. What the hell is looking for me? [eerie music] - How's it looking? - It severed the primary circuits. I'm gonna have to rewire em. [electricity zapping] Shit! Shit. Shit. - You alright. - I've been better. - It's alright. I'll rewire them. You just talk me through it. - Okay. [humming] [snapping] - Gotcha you little bastard. [laughing] One more for Cutter. [laughing] Aw. Didn't even get the cheese did ya. [eerie music] [snapping] [muffled screaming] [tearing] [screaming] [cracking] [screaming] [banging] - What's going on out there? Can anybody hear me? Wiley? Kidwell? [eerie music] [rattling] - Bingo. [eerie music] Bingo. [chittering] Bingo. Is that you boy? [eerie music] Come on boy. Come on. [eerie music] Bingo. [squeaking] [screaming] [banging] [eerie music] [gasping] [sighing] [squeaking] Bingo. [squeaking] Bingo come here boy. Good boy. Where have you been you rascal. Good boy, good boy. [squeaking] - Okay, that's the last of em. What do I do now? What's next? [eerie music] Wiley? [eerie music] - Hey. [shouting] What? - Where the hell did you go? - I had to take a leak. - Man you scared the shit out of me. - Sorry did you fix it? - Yeah I think so. Now what do I do? - We got to open the circuit. Keep your fingers crossed. [clicking] Yes! Whoa! Alright. - You see who run this shit around here don't you. [whirling] [sighing] [clicking] - What happened? - I guess she won't hold a current. - Can we do it again? - No we can't do it again. The wire's too fucked up. [electricity zapping] - What are you doing? [squeaking] You hungry? Huh? [squeaking] Shivers. Shivers it's Kidwell, talk to me. Shivers. - What's going on Kidwell? - Bingo got loose and I went looking for him. - [Erhardt] Where is everybody? - I don't know. I'm trying to round up Shivers and Cutter now. - [Shivers] I'm here what do you want? - Where's here? - In the kitchen. I can't find Cutter. She was supposed to meet me at the elevator. - Well I found Bingo. So meet me at the lab on the way back. - What do you mean you found him? He's sitting right here stuffing his ugly face with grapes. - That's impossible. [screeching] [screaming] - Kidwell. [screaming] Kidwell! [screaming] [dramatic music] [screaming] - You take number four, I'll take number three. - No, no, let's take it together, come on. [shouting] - Open goddamn it. [shouting] You piece of shit. [eerie music] [dramatic music] - Where the fuck is he? - Shivers! - Shivers, quite messin around! Shivers! - [Hickock] Shivers. [water dripping] [eerie music] [shaky breathing] - Shivers. Shivers. [sighing] I can't believe a grown ass man lost. [banging] Shit Captain. [shushing] What? - I heard something. - What? Why we looking for Shivers, I'll never know. - Shit. - He got a shotgun and we got a light. [heavy breathing] I can't take much more of this. [squeaking] [shouting] Shit. Oh God. [laughing] [water dripping] [dramatic music] - Come on chicken shit. I'll kick your ass. [clicking] Come on. [screaming] [gun shooting] - He's in D-plex. [screaming] [gun shooting] - Shivers! We're coming Shivers. [gun shooting] [screaming] [dramatic music] [screaming] [gun shooting] [clicking] [screaming] Shivers! We're right here. We're right here! [eerie music] Run. Run. - Elevator. Come on. Come on! - Are there stairs that go below? - No, dead end. The only way up is through the elevator. [shouting] Come on. Hot! - What are you doing? - I think I can bypass through a switch. - Keep trying. - Hurry up. Do it! - Try it. - Nothing. - Try it. - Nothing! We got it. Come on. Come on! - I got to tie it off. [eerie music] [sparking] - Hurry up! It's closing, I can't hold it. - I'm coming hold it. No! No, no! No, no. Pull it Captain. Pull, pull Captain. There's something coming. It's coming. Help me Captain. Please! Please Captain! No! Ah! [splattering] [dramatic music] [eerie music] [banging] [heavy breathing] [air hissing] [banging] [air hissing] [tapping] [banging] [eerie music] [banging] [eerie music] [clicking] [heavy breathing] - Close it and lock it. - What about the others? - Shivers and Wiley aren't coming back. [heavy breathing] - Neither is Kidwell. - What about Cutter? - I don't know. The intercom's dead. [heavy breathing] Did you see it? - No. - Well it's a remarkable creature. Listen to this. - [Kidwell] Bingo got loose and I went looking for him. - [Erhardt] Where is everybody? - [Kidwell] I don't know. I'm trying to round up Shivers and Cutter now. - [Shivers] I'm here what do you want? - [Kidwell] Where's here? - [Shivers] In the kitchen. I can't find Cutter. She's supposed to meet me at the elevator. - [Kidwell] Well I found Bingo, so meet me at the lab on the way back. - [Shivers] What do you mean you found him? He's sitting right here stuffing his ugly face with grapes. - [Kidwell] That's impossible. [screeching] [screaming] - [Shivers] Kidwell? [screaming] Kidwell! [screaming] - Shut it off. [screaming] - We shape it. Kidwell was looking for a lab monkey. That was the image in her mind when she ran into it. Van Fleet called out a name just before he killed him. Madam Pip. I couldn't place it, until I remembered something in his psych profile. Madam Pip was the name of a carnival geek, that scared the hell out of him when he was a child. She appeared in his nightmares. - [Hickock] Don't do this. - It became what Kidwell was looking for. It became the memory triggered by Van Fleet's fear. - Stop it. - Do you realize what kind of intelligence, we're talking about here? - I said stop it! - This thing doesn't only change it's molecular structure. It can assume, the physical nature of human thought. - This thing just slaughtered five people. - Well that's the law of nature Captain. Survival of the fittest. This thing is the ultimate intellect, just the purity of self preservation. And uncomp-- [air rushing] [radio music] [animals screeching] [popping] [sizzling] - What's going on? Talk to me. - It's a random search for access to the source code. - What the hell does that mean? - Someone's trying to gain entry to the project. [engine whirling] They're in. - Whose in? [keys clacking] [eerie music] Jesus. - It's interfaced with the computer again. [eerie music] - What the hell does it want? - I don't know. Let's ask it. [keys clacking] It wants to go back. - You got to be kidding. [keys clacking] - It can't live here. It's dying. - Yes! Alright you son of a bitch. - I wouldn't get too exited Captain. It'll probably outlive us. - We've got air again. - Who do you thinks responsible for that? - Are you telling me that this thing, wants to make a deal with us? - Precisely. It needs us. - How? - The girl. [eerie music] - No. - Without an EDS subject, we can't open up the dimension. - Hook me up instead. - That's impossible. It takes at least eight hours of REM phase sleep, before a subject can be induced into EDS. She's already there. - Well maybe you forgot what happened last time. - Last time we let it get away from us. We didn't know what we were doing. There's a good chance we can open and close the dimension, before any harm comes to her. [somber music] Besides, if we don't, we'll all be dead in a couple of hours. - How do we know we can trust it? [somber music] - The anomia and dioxide tanks, on the alpha system are empty. I'm going to try cleaning the atmosphere in the lab. - How do I open these damn doors in here. Van Fleet locked me inside. - There's a safety release above the airlock seal. I'll keep an eye on our guest. If he does anything funny, I'll tell you to shut the air lock. I promise. - Alright. [squeeking] [keys clacking] [electric buzzing] [dramatic music] [zipping] [air hissing] I don't see it. - It's reduced it's mass density to an unrecognizable size. Remarkable. [eerie music] - Okay how do I do this again? - The four connectors are color coded to the inputs. Just make sure you secure them, before disconnecting the LSS. [air hissing] [eerie music] [liquid dripping] [eerie music] - I can't see it. But goddamn it I can feel it. - Its on the move. Get out of there. - I'm not leaving the girl. - Oh it won't harm her. It needs her. Now get out of there. [eerie music] [door scraping] [shoes tapping] - How's she doing? - Fine. - How long is this gonna take? - Not long. [engines whirling] [eerie music] [clicking] [keys clacking] I'm gonna try something. - [Hickock] What are you doing? - Programming the computer to disengage the neuro center, once she's tuned in to the dimension. - Why? - Well the energy surge will be minimalized. And she should be able to withstand it. - Well what if she can't. - Then we're all dead. [eerie music] [beeping] 15 seconds. How's her heart rate? - 68 and steady. - 25.
