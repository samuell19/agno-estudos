Even at ninety, Betty Boop is wrinkle-free, just more colorful. The spicy beauty is no longer a movie star, but she remains a well-known personality. Her fame has not faded and her popularity has only grown over the years. The whole world knows this iconic character. And her face is surprisingly decorated with a t-shirt of the frontman of the band The Cure! Her dance remains with us, so does the legendary song "Boopupadup". Betty will be here forever. She was born in the 1930s and recently appeared on the cover of the New Yorker magazine, condemning sexual harassment. How do we see Betty Boop today? The 1930s emerged from the ruins of the stock market crash. In a single day, October 24, 1929, the American dream collapsed. Millions of shaken people found themselves broke. Prosperity and carefreeness disappeared out of sight. But then an attractive baby-voiced singer emerged in the working-class neighborhoods of New York. The future star of cartoons, Betty Boop, won the hearts of Americans. From the beginning, the character created by Max Fleischer immediately became a star. Betty appeared in more than a hundred films and her name shone until 1939. Never before had a cartoon female character reached the pinnacle of American cinema. Her fate could have been completely different. She first appeared in the movie Dizzy Dishes. She didn't have a stage name yet. Also her face was different. The floppy ears and muzzle made her look more like a bulldog than a girl! But her sensual curves were unmistakable. Max Fleischer decided to remove her from the animal world, gradually removing her canine appearance, and thus the unique Betty Boop was born! -Betty was the first human cartoon star. The primacy belongs to her in many ways. The first human and the first female character to star in a cartoon series. It's amazing that all these long years until recently, this century, she was the only main female protagonist. -The economic crisis did not affect Hollywood too much. It was saved by a revolutionary technological discovery: the talking film. The audience was fascinated by the talking film. The glamor and sex appeal of the stars on screen and in private seemed to ensure a bright future for Hollywood studios. -In Hell's Angels Howard Hughes started doing from unknown actors stars. -Betty Boop definitely fell into the category of these stars, which were similar in many ways. The appearance was typical for that time. -Betty is hot, she looks like a little "pin-up", poster girl The 1930s are the poster girl era in America. And she is created in the spirit of the 30s. She has short dresses. I think it was a strapless dress, although they could have had thin straps. It was provocative at the time. Plus it shows the garter. That wasn't right back then! She was forceful, daring and one could say that she was also "catchy". It was common for movie actresses, but it was something new for a cartoon character. -Betty Boop had nothing to do with her one and only cartoon competitor, Minnie Mouse, a poor damsel in distress, condemned by her creator, Walt Disney to subservience to Mickey. Betty Boop wanted to compete with the Hollywood goddesses. She had voluptuous long legs like Mae West, dark dreamy eyes like Clara Bow, her clothes made men's knees buckle, she drew attention to herself. Watch out for blonde bombshell Jean Harlow! -I think Betty is a sex icon. He also personifies a certain cliché. She is not very smart, so she is an ideal girl. "Don't talk too much, it's better if you're sexy. I like looking at you." She was not responsible for this look, it was the audience's business. -Betty Boop viewers were moviegoers of the time, i.e. more mature than today's people interested in animated films. The name "Betty" was also a slang term for "girl". The "girl" was "Betty". It was worth it. -What's important about Betty is that she was sexy, but she didn't really understand. She was a naturally sensual being. -Betty Boop had all the advantages for seducing a male audience. But wouldn't it be simplistic to limit her to the world of male imagination? -To me, Betty Boop represents a flapper, i.e. a modern girl of the 20s who is free-spirited, pretty much does what she wants, lives her own way and in the evening she does things that were inappropriate at the time and earned her the label of a girl with free manners. -Had a hairstyle like Louise Brooks and liked to go to nightclubs. She became a follower of the flappers, a generation of girls who broke social and sexual conventions. They live at night, dance to wild rhythms, smoke, seduce men and drink in the era of American prohibition. -I really like this wild time. And if I lived in it, I'd definitely wear garters and stick a patch behind them. Hundred percent! -A fearless girl appeared, an emancipated woman in a short dress. For the first time, women showed their legs, had short hair, cut their hair short. It was a time of great freedom and Betty Boop was born, in an era of emancipated women. -The era of corsets ended, women could move freely, enjoy your body. They were brave, drove sports cars and dreamed of one day flying across the ocean in a biplane like Amelia Earhart. -Betty Boop, in my opinion, embodies femininity, modernity, power, other energy. She was thought of as a militant personality, that is, with respect to the time. It was an era of women who wanted to assert their rights. In this, Betty is extremely modern. -Women owed the first emancipation wave in part to the suffragettes. At the beginning of the 20th century, when the world was rapidly modernizing, they formed committees to present their demands and regularly held protest marches. They demanded the right to vote, reserved only for men. They won in 1920. That was when American women could vote for the first time. In 1932, the presidential campaign reached its peak. The fight between Hoover and Roosevelt is going as expected. Women do not run for office and the fearless Betty decides to correct the inequality. She will announce her candidacy for president and enter the debate between Republicans and Democrats. Armed with expansive, unconventional proposals, she wins the election and makes history as the first female president of the United States. -She has her desires, her motivations - and acts accordingly. And that is a sign of feminism. -Several decades later, she will repeat her success Claire Underwood, played by Robin Wright in House of Cards. Unfortunately, the reality does not yet match the fiction. Betty Boop is a visionary, but above all a girl of her time, a citizen, a New Yorker. -But she went to work. She had a job, she had to take care of herself, she earned money, no one helped her, and she actually represented tribute to working women. Betty Boop truly epitomized a period of great crisis. And that, among other things, was her success. That's why she was the right character at the right moment. It was a relief for people to find something from their lives on screen. -Since the beginning of the Great Depression, the government has been monitoring Hollywood. There were no unemployed or impoverished families on the screen, only gangsters settling their accounts in back alleys, and a terrifying monster that feeds on the blood of young people. A metaphor for the economic crisis can be seen in this monster. Unlike traditional animated productions, Fleischer openly addressed the subject of the American financial crash. In the movie Ups and Downs, Betty, like millions of Americans, has to leave housing she doesn't have. Although she was a cartoon character, she did not leave the real situation and authentically portrayed the "girl next door". solving real situations. -It was a difficult road full of obstacles, but Betty always managed it optimistically, ready to face further challenges. And that's what people really needed. -Betty Boop mirrored her creator's family. The Fleischers were indomitable, determined to start a new life as soon as they arrived in New York in 1887. They came from Krakow and fled the persecution of the Jews. -William, Max's father, arrived first. He arranged everything before Max's mother Emilia arrived with sons Charles and Max. -Betty's Jewish roots are only mentioned once on screen, in Minnie from the Moocher, Cunning Minnie. -Jews did not appear in Hollywood films, so it's interesting that Fleischer turned out to have Jewish parents. That was a real breakthrough. -Betty refuses to eat a traditional meal that night, presented by parents we only see once. Betty rejects family customs, expressing her desire to be 100% American. As if Max Fleischer was paying tribute to his mother. -It's Emilia's story. The moment she boarded the ship, she decided not only to be American herself, but also that her family would be American. This is very common among first generation immigrants to America. -The family will experience failure. Patriarch William cannot face the competition of the big textile stores and has to close his business. The Fleischers leave Manhattan and settle in Brooklyn. Max and his brother Dave often perform acrobatic stunts on bicycles in front of amused passers-by for a few cents. -Max had a sense of art and fun. He was also an introspective inventor and was fascinated by how things worked and how they could be improved. Max made a living by illustrating for Popular Science magazine, Popular science. His boss attended a 1914 screening of Dinosaur Gertie, directed by Winsor McCay. He was impressed by the dinosaur's remarkably believable animation, even if the movement was still choppy. The next day, he assigned his young employee to fix the problem. Max took him seriously. -That was the spark that ignited him. He tried to adjust the animation to make it smoother and more natural. He also involved technically savvy brothers and they worked on the task in the evenings for about 2 years. And so the first rotoscope was born. For the first test, Dave donned a clown costume and posed for Max's camera. -Rotoscopy is a technique used to rotate footage you redraw frame by frame and put the colored ultrafan foils in front of the background. This creates a rotoscope of the action. -"Coco walks, dances and jumps like a human!" - wrote the New York Times after the premiere in 1919. Did the Fleischer brothers know that they had revolutionized the world of animation? -Max was a visionary, a guiding spirit. He understood what the market needed and how to give it to him. -Max and Dave now ran their own studio, Fleischer Studios. The first King Kong enters the screen. The Empire State Building will become the tallest building in the world and New York is crazy about the musical novelty - jazz. Were the Fleischer brothers ahead of their time? Controversial and politically incorrect music has gained fans even outside the circle of insiders. -Music was important because the Betty Boop movies accompanied by great jazz musicians. It was a busy time and artistic creation was intertwined. -At a time when black and white musicians could not play in the same clubs, Betty dared to invite 2 future famous African-American jazzmen. They were Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong. -The footage with Armstrong and Calloway is the first known footage their performance, and it's tremendous. It meant introducing these artists and introducing them to all audiences, but primarily to a white audience. -Betty used her fame to promote jazz and jazz performers and they in turn inspired her best films. -I really like that bit by Cab Calloway. It has an "answering machine" - call and answer - known from the penal environment. It is similar to convict songs. And it fits the animation, the words in the answer are repeated. Betty finds herself in situations that make her afraid. This music comes from bars, from prisons. And it actually draws on everything that haunts us at night. And at the same time it encourages people to listen to jazz. -Though cartoons with a jazzy vibe they complemented each other perfectly, they did not always escape racial stereotypes. However, the Fleischers refused to use the so-called Blackface character. It was, for example, Al Jolson in the movie The Jazz Singer. Caucasian actor with black face makeup. - It wouldn't work today. It's a troubling image for any dark-skinned or African-American. -Betty Boop has a voice - and what a voice! Sexy voice, chirping "Boopupadup" mischievously, coquettishly and naively. Betty's famous "booping" was later immortalized as the "pupupids" in the movie Somebody Likes It Hot. -Then she was replaced by Marilyn Monroe. They have a lot in common, although Marylin was sexually provocative, which is not the case for Betty. But there is something childish about her face, she is naive. Her expression is understandable. And there is also something about her that grabs your heart. It's - she's still really alone, she has to arrange everything herself. No one supports her. And so you might want to take care of her. It makes you feel that way. -Yes, Betty has a soul. She is alone, but with us. He is in the room with us. So it actually belongs in the family. -The relationship between Max and the character he created is sometimes contradictory. Sometimes he is a caring uncle. At other times, an impresario associated with tabloid magazines. In a shocking interview with Screenland magazine, Betty claims that if she were to write a biography, Isadora Duncan would be next to her she looked like a piece of ice. -Interview in Screenland is a bit bizarre in its emphasis on sex, it was primarily about publicity. It was done the same way with real live stars. They had fake relationships and married and got married, even though they were actually gay. And Betty also fell into that category. -Who is the real Brigitte. Look at. I have two American magazines here. -Americans are based on French newspapers, and they come from fictional sources, so I don't care at all what they write here. -Initials B.B. Before Brigitte Bardot, Betty Boop was an ageless doll. Max Fleischer was behind her phenomenon, while Roger Vadim claimed to be Bardot's inventor. director of And God Created Woman. Unlike Bardot, off screen Betty is still dependent on the will of her creator. He was able to shape her according to his wishes much more than a flesh and blood actress. Betty lives alone, surrounded by men who only care about one thing: seize her. -Therein lies the danger of pop culture, if you don't think about it. It normalizes conditions and we then consider them acceptable. -The woman doesn't want to. The man forces her and her face suddenly shows ecstasy. A scene seen so many times in the film that forced sex between men and women has been romanticized. -I wonder how many young men have seen this scene, and then they thought: I'll go home and try it. - They actually instilled this in us. When a woman is interested in you, she rejects you. And if a man likes you, he might hit you or throw himself at you. This is also said to children. I also heard it when I was young: "He runs after you, he likes you." But he hit me! -It was definitely more accepted that a man has the right to be more aggressive or more violent and expect certain things from a woman. He personified that right. But when you saw Betty being treated like that, it didn't seem right to treat her like that, and perhaps it could be inferred from this that no woman should be treated that way. -What I really like about Betty is her carefree nature. She doesn't really care if she's doing great or someone is bothering her and the like, she will say to herself: "Oh well, I'll do my thing anyway." -It seems "flushing" to us. Nothing will touch her. Something happens, and she - it won't hurt her. -Women cannot yet fully express their opinion, and so silence is the only option for Betty to survive. -How old is Betty in those movies? You imagine she is maybe 18 or 19. -I hope she's at least 25. -I think Betty is somewhere between twenty and thirty. In short, Betty Boop is a young woman. -The young woman Fleischer's animators like to undress. However, when Betty invites her friends to her birthday, we are surprised that there are only 14 candles on the cake! -Maybe it was a lazy animator. Either they didn't know how many candles to draw, or she's 14. And we have another look at Betty Boop. -Betty would then portray hypersexualized teenage girl. This is an obsessively recurring film character that fascinates a number of filmmakers. Stanley Kubrick and his Lolita, Louis Malle and the Girl, Martin Scorsese and Iris in Taxi Driver, and Luc Besson and Matilda in Léon. Many women tried to imitate Betty. The most famous was Mae Questelová, who devoted herself to it for several years. -I remember talking to Mae Questel on the phone. I was still little and she spoke in Betty Boop's voice and I believed I was talking to Betty. I really enjoyed it and had no idea how remarkable it was. -Betty Boop's huge success and fame also causes envy, for example the actress Helen Kane. Kane accused Betty of plagiarizing her voice. In 1934, she sued Fleischer Studios and demanded $250,000. But in a dramatic move, the defense attorneys proved irrefutably that the plaintiff was not the first to sing "Boopupadup" and that she even stole the song from a black jazz singer called Baby Esther. -So Helen Kane heard Baby Esther sing in a cabaret. Boopupadup was sung often, it was a scat, jazz chant known from many African-American bars. It wasn't just Baby Esther or Cab Calloway singing it. -This music, African-American music, took off at that time into Caucasian entertainment only recently. If a white man sings a song for the first time, it does not mean that he is the author. -Another challenge awaits Betty. The powerful Catholic National League of Decency launched a relentless fight against Hollywood. There is too much debauchery, violence, sex and alcohol on the screens! The League had 20 million members, Sunday sermons condemned so-called indecent films, the threat was serious. It prompted the producers to consider the concept for more films. In 1934, the producers decided to follow the famous Hays Production Code to avoid a liquidation boycott of their films. This code, a moral guide, prohibited, among other things, nudity, interracial love affairs, homosexuality and adultery. The end of the outburst! -In that first three-year period, films with Betty were unusual and funny and also - in short, they were animated films with Betty Boop. And then the Hays Code came along and ruined everything. Thanks, Will Hays! -Goodbye to surrealism and subversive skits! Betty remade herself: curls disappeared, necklines shrank, dresses lengthened. The Fleischers first tried to circumvent censorship, for example in the film House Cleaning Blues. At the beginning of the movie, the house is a mess because Betty threw a wild party, which had evidently slipped out of her hand. Everything is upside down so she has to clean up, but she enjoyed the party beforehand. I think it managed to cover up her usual wildness a bit. -But Betty gets angry, frowns and literally tears her hair. The studio is looking for new friends for her. First it's Grampy, the senior conservation professor. He invents devices that make housework easier. Then comes Pudgy the dog, to whom he assigns the best gags. Betty started out as a puppy, and now she's about to be robbed of her glory by this rascal! -Films made according to the Hays Code are unwatchable. They are boring and tame too. Once they lengthened Betty's skirt, it was as if they suddenly didn't know what to do with her. -What's left? What's left of Betty Boop then? -When Max Fleischer invented Betty Boop, he created a sensual, emancipated and sexy naughty girl, desired by men and admired by women. The Hays Code didn't protect her, it weakened her. Should society judge women by the length of their skirts? In 1937, Disney's exemplary and innocent Snow White triumphs in cinemas. It is ironic that Walt Disney pulled the animator who drew the heroine from Fleischer. The inspiration came from the 1933 Betty Boop fairy tale of the same name. -Disney's Snow White was different, she retold the story. Fleischer's take was a little creepier and weirder, but it portrayed all the surreal that lies beneath the poisoned apple. you can imagine. -Disney's idyllic world and childish humor contributed to a sugar-coated view of America and gained an ever-larger audience. Fleischer's production tried to differentiate and adapted Popeye the sailor, Gulliver and Superman. They were not the original characters, they were masculine, muscular, giant heroes, possibly equipped with supernatural abilities. The rivalry raged and Betty's patriotism did not save her. Her adventure ends in August 1939, 2 years before the United States entered the war. Men will head to the front, women will replace them in production. But after the victory, the women return to the stove. It's as if Betty Boop foresaw the rise of the American housewife of the 1950s after the repeal of the Hays Code. With the invention of color television, Betty becomes a beauty and enters every household. -At that time it gained a children's audience because cartoons after the Code, they were more successful with younger viewers. -Although Betty left the film studios in the late 1930s, televising her stories earned her a place in the collective memory. -It was an extraordinary idea to create a little character, but at the same time seductive and sexy. And she had such a big head! -The disproportion of the head to the body impresses everyone, because that's what babies look like. So something draws you to the bigger head and smaller body. And she is simply cute, so she is also attractive to children, children like her. -They created a truly original character. You will remember it. The audience clung to her. -Betty Boop has always been a sweetheart. So she is surrounded by a certain tenderness and fondness. -And the peculiarity of her personality is childlike or is she sexy? Is it like this or different? It cannot be precisely defined. He has a lot of fans among bikers and also among gays. Different communities draw from it and it is related to what is essential, because you feel good the way you are. -Betty Boop charmed not only the American audience. In Japan, the creator of manga comics, Osamu Tezuka, discovered Betty Boop as a teenager at the local movie theater. The large eyes of his Princess Knight and Astro Boy testify to the author's admiration for their distant relative. -I remember that sometime when I was fifteen, Betty Boop was the first for me, who embodied femininity. And it was the portrayal of femininity in a cartoon character that caught my attention. It expressed sensuality. In my fashion designs since 1982, I have created a historical overview of intangible Hollywood icons, i.e. the cartoon ones. I immediately thought of Betty Boop, so I placed her on this sweater, where I pretend to be a Hollywood actor, a Marlon Brando-style rebel in the movie On the Waterfront. And Betty reads about her adventures, about "celluloid heroes", heroes that last forever. -Betty Boop definitely inspired me. And not just the garter. When I was younger, I don't do that anymore, I used to wear mini skirts or short dresses and she was showing a decorative garter. I have closets full of those dresses. I don't wear them anymore. But at that time it was an inspiration for me. -Truthfully, when I was younger, I didn't care about that figure. She meant nothing to me growing up. Such a pretty poster girl. But when I was preparing my video, my director Saam Farahmand thought it would be interesting to make me into a cartoon character based on Betty Boop, because we were making a movie about pop icons, both real and fictional, and their impact on society. Being a strong woman in the modern age means being able to use everything, all your superpowers, all your tools. And I found out how femininity, elegance, sexuality work. That slightly more old-fashioned feminine appeal. And it fascinates me. I like this. How the power of that attraction was portrayed back then. -Betty returned to the screen again in 1985 the movie The Romance of Betty Boop This comedy was based on the usual scheme about a dirty prince. This time it's a rich man whom Betty wants to marry. -The problem with upgrading Betty was the removal her best features. That was not a good solution. -Yet 5 years later, at the request of Max's son, Hollywood director Richard Fleischer, Lili Zanuck and her husband took on the production of a new film with Betty Boop. They entrusted the direction to the young talented animator Steve Moore. -In the film, you can see the influence of Fleischer's first films here and there. Betty works as a waitress in an unattractive establishment. She falls in love with Johnny. But the main theme of the film is Betty's quest to find her lost comedian father. I don't know how the separation happened. -Snow White has no mother, only a stepmother. This is how it starts for both of them, they don't have a mother. I don't know if the authors have the impression that those who have a mother are not in danger. I don't know. It feels weird to me, and it felt weird to me at the time. It's just a regular pattern. So Betty Boop is understandably looking for a father, not a mother. -A couple of guys help her find her dad and she gets married. End. Come to think of it, it's not exactly a feminist story if you're wondering if Betty is a feminist. You would have to hire some women for that. Well, seriously! We miss that, don't you think? When you put a couple of guys in charge of figuring out how to write a feminist female character, it's not going to work. They will screw it up. -The project did not materialize in the end. In addition to the black-and-white skit in Roger Rabbit, where Betty plays a battered nightclub hostess, her artistic career dies. Over the years, new interpretations of both her look and spirit have replaced the original Betty Boop. She became the muse of designers, the face of large commercial brands, the queen of souvenirs. Betty Boop is everywhere! The working girl of the 1930s has improved. As an icon, it is worth several million dollars today. -I'm sorry that the world didn't develop further in her career. But she lives on, like many icons. And she is doing well because she is perhaps more popular than before. -It's actually a shame that people don't know how it all happened, because it's not just a Betty Boop story. It's about the history of our understanding of women's role in entertainment and in the world. It's about our view of society. All of this can be traced to this character trying to keep his place throughout the period. -On November 27th of 2017, this sexy brunette from the 30s storms back to the front pages and becomes a feminist icon. - Is it supposed to be Harvey Weinstein? Yes. Ok then. -New Yorker magazine cover featuring Betty Boop... It was such a wonderful surprise because we had no idea what was coming. Suddenly she appeared. -The Weinstein affair just broke out. Harvey Weinstein, still untouchable, the last mogul of independent American cinema, a pampered Oscar-winning producer, is accused of sexually harassing and assaulting ten admirably brave women. New Yorker editors and cartoonist Barry Blitt put Betty Boop on the cover, to condemn his wrongdoing. -The illustration is great, mainly because Betty is in it bigger than that bastard. -I like it very much. It is the unification of women who have become victims of such persons. People like Weinstein were suddenly so small because you can't deny the facts and face women united, which present true claims and evidence-based facts. -And Betty looks disgusted and amazed at the matter, as if she is sabout to say, "Is this still happening? Didn't I warn you?" This should not be happening, and yet it is happening, even after ninety years. -Betty could probably handle the situation. Looking at her development, Betty would know how to handle herself if she was in that situation. -This scene takes place in 1932 in a circus and it is undoubtedly the first instance of sexual harassment by a superior in film. -It's so modern and no-nonsense. And I like the slap. Some objected: "He is acting so aggressively!" And I'm thinking: Well, yes, she's being aggressive because he's aggressive! The sad part is how we know it right away because we know it's happening all the time. -I wonder what she would think of Trump today, because she had an opinion on everything. For her generation, she was a woman who was proactive and thoughtful. -She would probably demonstrate with other women, I can imagine it. -Women have been organizing protest marches for more than a century and they fight for their rights. -I was 12 when I made Leon, my first film. After the premiere, at the age of thirteen, I was very happy. I excitedly opened the first letter from a fan. He wrote to me imagining that he would rape me. -The "Me Too" movement is spreading in society today and empowering women to express themselves like never before. -I say to people of every gender: let's find the space, where our mutual pleasure will be based on consent. Let the vast limitless range of desire manifest itself. Let's make a revolution of desire! -Betty Boop would also believe in the Me Too movement. Through her actions in the films, she proved that her body belongs to her, that she knows how to set a boundary, who can touch her and when. I would emphasize that the most. Her body belongs to her! -Fighting, sexy, working or at home, object and independent woman, best friend and feminist pioneer. From the suffragettes to the women's marches of the 1930s to today's protests, not all women have it in them something from betty boop? -A woman's self-confidence can also include that a woman is sexy, wears suspenders and says things like "Boopupadup." Why not? I want to live in such a world.
