Why would you speak? What would you say to yourself ...dead? Fucking hell. It's here. Because everyone always says: "Ah, you're a lion, you die and you come back to life. You're like a phoenix. You die and you come back to life. That's how it is with you. I won't even visit you in hospital as I know you'll get well." And I always say the same thing: "But one day I might not get well and won't recover." How do you make a movie? How does a movie come to life? It can be born in a death sentence given by a doctor saying, "You'll die in 3 months". And from that point on, you start to create a story. I'm taking cymbalta. - 60mg. - But it's not working. - Something's weird... - It's a medicine way too strong. - I'm back where I started. - What will happen to him? We have to talk to Daniele Riva. I'm taking the 60mg one. I'm also taking that one... What did you eat for lunch? - I'm taking the 300mg one. - It's terrible. I haven't been able to sleep. I took it at midnight. - I also take the... - I get a little distracted. Mr. Hector. Mr. Hector. I'm taking a... Mr Hector. Hector. Stop! What do you have to do to become a movie director? You have to know how to tell a story, and for that you have to live. The first thing you have to do is get away from here. Come here, I'll show you something. In Germany I had a friend who made movies. During the war he escaped to North America and ended up being successful in Hollywood. And what's this for? To frame, and see only what interests you. I'm giving it to you. Now it's yours. Frame me up like you did before. Am I in the frame? - My love... - Wait, I'm framing you... Like before. Then you'll see on the lens what number it is. Wait, Hector. Be patient with your students. Okay? - Am I in the frame? - Yes, my love. - Then see what is the number. - The number is here. - The lens goes from 24 to 105. - It's at 105. - Then it's completely tight! - I know. That's why the distance between this hand... Now I'm cutting back to a wider angle. - See? Cut to close up. - That's what I did before. I just want to explain one thing to you. Get my nose in focus. - Get my whole face in focus. - I have. - Here my hand is out of focus. - I know. As you zoom in the focus becomes finer. And you lose background focus. Got it. If you zoom out to wide 24 you'll be focused on my face and on my hand here. - I'll zoom out. - Zoom out, look here. It's all in focus. You can even see the pool. You see? Everything is in focus. - Got it? - Yes. That's it. You're beautiful. You're very beautiful. Don't waste time romanticising every moment, otherwise you'll have a movie lasting 4 hours and 15 minutes. - My love... - You have to be able to synthesize. I know what I'm talking about. You're not going to make a series about me. The Death of Hector: episode 1, 2, 3... Making movies is almost like a cocoon. It's born out of something, a nut, something enclosed. It is born, it sprouts, it develops, and then it acquires a purpose, an enormous social identity. But what goes on is the feeling that first inspired it. I think the desire to do it, the desire to be alive that materialised from the concept of finishing a movie. As if by filming you're living an extra day. I don't know what came first, filming or being alive. In this way, fiction comes into being. It comes from inventing a feeling and developing it. And my greatest pain is in relation to the difficulty in doing this. It's as if imagining and thinking leave much still to be done and time is short, and the feeling grows that the great work hasn't been achieved. Every time I ask What, when, how and where you always reply maybe, maybe, maybe. - She wants to record my pain. - Travelling is very difficult. She wants to record my pain. Here in Paris, in the Latin Quarter, enjoying our holiday. After success always comes the storm. It couldn't be different this time. Here I am once more going through a little domestic tragedy. I had just finished Kiss Of The Spider Woman, and I got cancer. I was 38 years old. Then, while suffering from cancer, I made Ironweed. And I made At Play In The Fields Of The Lord in the Amazon, still sick. I remember that the ganglia had grown so much in my groin that Dr. Drauzio made me get a charter flight. We finished a night shoot at 6am. I got on a charter plane at 7:30 or 8 a.m. I got to São Paulo, they took out the ganglia. On Saturday I rested at home, flew back on Sunday and on the Monday morning I was filming. With more than forty stitches in my body. Nobody knew. And Dr Drauzio told me clearly: "You have four to six months to live." Did a doctor come during the night? No, I was afraid of that. They're giving me too much cymbalta. It's not cymbalta, it's morphine. They're giving me cymbalta. Okay. And I'm afraid of... of... Of what? It hurts me. But cymbalta is a painkiller. - Really? - Yes. Cymbalta is a painkiller. That's why you began taking it more than 20 days ago. I'm in pain. What makes you feel like this... is what's killing the pain because the cymbalta wasn't working anymore, so they put in neorotin and took away the lyrica. And now they've given you a very strong dose of morphine. That's why you're in this state. Even in the most difficult moments it never occurred to me that I might cease to be, cease to exist. I always had supreme confidence in my capacity to be lucky and survive. I saw a boy running I saw the time Playing around the edges Of that boy's pathway I put my feet in the stream And I guess I never Took them out again The sun was still shining On the road And I never passed by I saw the woman preparing Another person San Martin, Rivadavia, Belgrano, Moreno, Colombo, Rawson, Godoy, Castelli, Alvarada, Villanel. I remember absolutely everything. Things from my neighbourhood. The left-winger Perincha who played for San Isidro the Polack Stauka. Travelling standing up in the truck to the country, to Saba's little football ground. They were a second division team. What wonderful stories! Autumn, the ground covered in leaves. On the sidewalk we walked over them and they went "crackle, crackle"... It was so beautiful. And we didn't know that. It's beautiful because we remember it. Maybe the word was "refuge", where I find and nourish myself to be able to understand things better. Because to be a Jew was to be nothing. If you're Jewish you don't belong, and you weren't born anywhere, and you hear your parents and friends, your parents' friends speaking a language that nobody else in our street speaks, Yiddish for example. And this makes you feel you're a person who doesn't belong in the community. I think the word it's like the cinema, like a dark place where I sought protection, distraction, those were my guides. I took much refuge in reading. I remember I dreamt of being ill so I could stay at home reading in bed. I daydreamed. "Oh, how good it'll be if I get ill tomorrow so I can finish that book." There's a great difference between the first movie we see, and the movie that we take to heart. Never again could we feel anything as strong as what we felt at that moment. - The subtitles? - It's an old movie. It came like this. We can't read a thing. - So what do you want? - Fix them. I told you, It's an old movie. It came like this. I've asked myself many times if it wasn't a subconscious desire to repeat the sensation of that moment which impelled me to want to make movies. Movies are made here in São Paulo. Movie crews are formed here. Movie production happens here. Movies come from here ready for general release. Talkies are the great culprits in the transformation of those who think a wooden shack confines them more than a prison I decided to stay in Brazil because I think it is a country where reality supersedes fiction at a much greater rate than in Argentina. Also because I like Brazil much more than Argentina. I think I have much more scope to work here, I think Brazilian reality is much more attractive, richer, more expressive, more contradictory, more chaotic, and it's here I want to do my work. I'm a person who has become reasonably anarchist. My idea of survival involves adopting an anarchist stance to confront the world. And always, ever since boyhood, I've had a horror of being employed, that is to depend on a fixed salary and a job, to have a boss and fixed hours. Babenco, is it true that before you became successful you sold graves in the Morumbi cemetery? I was an ace. I made money from whole families because I did a kind of improvisation trying to get them to imagine that at the moment when death comes calling on their family, father, mother, wife, son... the last thing in the world you want to deal with at that moment is the worry about having to buy a grave in the cemetery to bury your relative. So I switched the lights on and off to simulate death... I did a thousand things, and I tell you everyone bought them like popcorn. For a year and a half I was an extra. I did westerns, war movies. I played Red Indians in several movies. I learned how to ride a horse, to be quick on the draw. Until one day I got tired of it and left. Well? Did you get it or not? Do it all again. Make your entrance. Rita Cadilac! - Have you ever been arrested? - Yes, I have. And I know what it means to be in isolation. I loved the idea of being a contrarian, but I think the call to be a Visconti when I grew up was stronger. To be a movie director. And you've got the court records of you being arrested in Spain? Yes. I wore prison garb. Oh! Prison garb? Yeah. Doing hard time. On prison rations. It was mid-winter, there was a cold draught in the cell. I lay in bed or walked around. That's why I pace around when I'm writing a screenplay. I pace from one side to the other. It's something that comes from prison. Eternal gratitude, divine providence, life, destiny. So try to find a more colloquial tone as if you're speaking within the objective of the movie. As if it were a testimony, a non-existent judgement. When everybody would relate what they remember about that day. It's a mix of testimony and reflection and that's why it's so strange. Please, people. Please. I'm asking you please. Those who want to chat can go and chat outside. This won't do. It's a delicate scene, we're all trying to discover what needs to be done. Anyone still alive take off your clothes and come out naked! Anyone still alive take off your clothes and come out naked! It's very difficult to speak definitively. But we can say I'm talking about hope. We can say that I'm talking about social outcasts. We can even say that outcasts are closer to God than any other person alive on this planet. We can also say that outcasts are people whose lives court death all the time. We can also say that outcasts have no conscience and that their purpose in life rests solely in the moment of action. And we can say that I love outcasts. I made Pixote, and the movie before it was about the Death Squad. Now I have made a movie in which I think I have raised the level of the narration, another dimension of achievement for the moment. Suck it my little boy. Mummy's with you. Let go of me Pixote. Let go of me Pixote. I don't want this. Take your filthy mouth off me. I'm not your mother, you hear? I'm not your mother. I don't want a son. I hate children. Go live your life. We all get by as best we can. Get out! We were having lunch here, sitting on the rails. There was nothing else to sit on. There was a crew here, six or seven people. Clovis Bueno, Rodolfo Sanchez... And I looked up and saw a boy playing at tightrope walking along the rails and I said, "Let's get the camera, because I think that in some way that symbolises what the movie is about." But he asked, "What are you going to do with it?""I have no idea." Brazil is a country with a population of 120 million, of whom about 50% are under 21 years of age, and of those about 28 million children exist below the standards set out by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In the typical picture, the parents go to work and their kids stay at home, usually looked after by an older sister or some neighbour who gets paid. Fernando, for example, who is the main character in the movie Pixote, lives with his mother and nine siblings in this house. It's undeniable that I'm a pariah. I wasn't born in Brazil. But the truth is I'm alone. Exile is a state of the spirit, but I feel like Brazil doesn't want me. I feel like Brazil doesn't accept me, or I don't accept myself in Brazil. I don't know. The Argentinians think I'm Brazilian, the Brazilians think I'm Argentinian. So it's hard to accept the absence of my own roots, my own identity. We're interrupting our schedule to bring you some breaking news. Is there a remedy for guilt, Doctor? One for you. Jewish piece of shit. I've been dead meat for a long time. I'm just waiting for my time to come. The best thing about prison is getting out. Let's go someplace where they will never find us! Never! Never! How is your hearing? - About 70%. - Okay. And your limbs? Any loss of strength in your arms or legs? Loss of strength everywhere. Do you think this has been progressive? Is this loss of strength increasing? Yes. Have you noticed if you're forgetting things, either past things or more recent things? Yes. - Would you like to come with us? - Yes. I'll give you a questionnaire for your security... I'm used to it. And I'll ask you to put your cellphone away, alright? Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! - I liked it. - See? He asked us the questions we wanted to hear. He asked questions... Of course. But that's okay, I'm certain it will indicate something. And it'll be something incurable, no medication. But maybe it can be contained for a time. It can be contained and not break out again. There might be something new in the pipeline. I have to live with this new reality. My speech is different, I think at a different speed, and so I keep on living, keep on living. That's it. We mustn't complain. Keep on living. I wanted to make the movie as if it was my last one. I have to speak about myself. I don't remember where I was or why. They bring me a cooler like those picnic ones, a professionally made beautiful one, blue plastic, with all my documents, all my scans, radiographies, blood tests, with my entire medical history for my trip to the States to get a final diagnosis of what's wrong with me. Suddenly I'm at the airport, and I don't know who, at what point someone, an airline agent or some official, comes over to tell me they'd noticed there were too many documents and they'd decided to take some out, and I get really hysterical and say, "You might have taken something that appears unimportant to you, but is very important in my medical notes. It could alter the results of my case study." I infiltrate myself into the entrails of the airport, into corridors, and I open each room, knock and open, to see if I can find the people who made that decision. I find really strange things. I find a chemist's lab with a lot of technicians working with test tubes, or into another place that's a butcher's, but all white, all the meats are white, everything's white. I look at my watch and it's 1.05 am, I'm maybe the last passenger because the check-in desk is deserted, and I get there and there's my box, my cooler or whatever the hell you call that poxy fridge. When I open it I see it's empty, there are just a few drops of filthy water, stale water that's remained there since the cooler was actually used. It's obvious there's nothing in the cooler, absolutely nothing. It's empty. At that moment I woke up. My love... My love... Let's eat? - Or it'll get too cold. - What? - It's already half past two. - And what do I have on today? You have some filming to do. - What of? - Of dreams. We gotta have lunch, or the food will get cold. Seriously, it's getting too cold. You want to eat cold steak? - No. Why would I eat cold steak? - Is it okay for you to eat cold steak? No, I won't eat steak. Why? Have they already fried the meat? - Well, we're in the hospital. - Ah, Barbara. - We're in Czechoslovakia... - We're in Padova. This movie relates in a fictionalised form... - I don't like it. - No, fictionalised is ugly, right? I really don't like it, I won't watch a movie like this. "I had to tell the story in this movie before it was too late." No. I think that's about it. "This movie is based on facts which really happened to me." - I don't like it, Hector. It's bad. - "Facts" are ugly. No, they're not facts, and they really happened. "This movie is what happened in the most recent years of my life." Do you like inspired? - I don't like inspired. "This movie is". - Based on? - I don't like it. It's not based on. - "This movie is." This movie is. But then you give it the aspect of a biography. So fucking what! "I decided to tell this story... so I can forget it." Hector Babenco. You bitch. You give me panettone, you weaken me and then you film me. Perfect! There's no need for Elia Kazan's Method. No need for Stella Adler. There's no need. I can't do it. It's no use. Because I'm not going to die. - You won't die? Ever? - Someday... Just like the poem says: "On a day I already have memories of." I don't want them to take me and give me hospital food. At my final meal I want to eat well. We should summon all our friends when we're dying. And say, "Listen folks, I'm going to die. Come by the house." And we'll cook some good food, tasty, I don't know, roast beef, a great big delicious salad, a dulce de leche pudding, natural, without sweeteners. We'll make some good caipirinhas, drink some good pinga. And there'll have to be a doctor, on the day of my death. Someone has to listen to my heart, right? And say, "It's stopped." Or, "He's dead, but his heart doesn't want to stop, it wants to go on." - It's done Barbara. - Really? - You're marvellous. - Seriously? - Seriously? - Yes. It's done my little monkey, it's done. Great, congratulations, it was really beautiful. - Was I a clown? - You were a clown. - Palhaça, clown. - Total clown. - Ridiculous. - Ridiculous. Really ridiculous? No, not at all. Was this your last film scene just like you wanted? That's what I wanted. Thanks. What a mess. This idea of the end is intolerable. It can't be like this. How long ago did you start to feel much weaker? Six months. - This weakness? - In your legs. In my legs about six months ago. It started going downhill bit by bit. It wasn't overnight. - Hector. - What? Today on the beach you weren't able to walk. Stop it... - Really? - Yeah! You couldn't go into the sea on your own. - When? - Today. - Now? - This morning. Now I'm afraid because you seem to be letting yourself slide. - That I'm surrendering? - Yeah! I'm trying to understand everything I'm dealing with. It's a combination of things. I'm not saying... It's something that might take its time, obviously, but it might happen. It's silly not to think about it, but if it doesn't happen, brilliant. I wish... I really wish... that many people will miss me. And that no one knows I'm alive, living in Hong Kong. Married to that goddess of the cinema Xu Jinglei. And reading the obituaries, smoking a good cigar. In a beautiful apartment overlooking the sea. And I have to be in Hong Kong because no one will find me there. And also I will realise that I'm in Hong Kong and I have no one to call, and no one will call me because they think I'm dead. Then I'm fucked. It'll be the moment to reinvent myself. I have already lived my death. All that's left is to make the movie, right? All that's left is to make the movie about my death. Silence please. WHAT A MACHO MAN, EH? KISSES FOR EVERYONE.
