No, no, no! That's not the question! If you have to ask yourself why you want to be an artist, you aren't one. It's like being tall or blonde. I don't agree. You can have a certain sensitivity but you have to develop it. But that's not what matters. What use is what we do? Why do we do it? Don't you see? To express ourselves. Isn't that the purpose of art? Yes, but art must communicate. It must move the viewer change him, transform him. What else is art for? - I disagree. - Stop, it can't change the world. - Coups change the world. - I totally disagree. - Artists are just here for the music. - What nonsense! I'm not saying we don't need a coup occasionally. But this is more effective. It's not about changing the law but changing the way people think. Careful, that can be used in many ways. Sure, sure, but we must think that art must make people think and feel and doesn't become the "bread and circuses" of capitalism. Exactly, that is the purpose of surrealism. It's so provocative that no one can remain indifferent. You can't change the world through mental masturbation. Stop kidding. - You're so old fashioned. - It's like a nightmare. And that's the key. There isn't anything to understand. But if you don't understand something, what use is it? It seeps into your subconscious - and changes you from the inside. - In fact, it's a matter of changing the world - without the world being aware. - Something isn't working because fascism is on the rise. Luis. And you? What was your purpose with Un Chien Andalou? And L'Age d'Or, it's coming out tomorrow. And the next ones. What are you looking for in your films? BUNUEL IN THE LABYRINTH OF THE TURTLES Luis! Luis... Luisito. Well, what are you waiting for? Come on! Everyone else is in the street! - Father has grounded us. - Come on... I talked to him and he's changed his mind. You're from Calanda and you can't miss this day. Can't she come? No, she can't. Come on! You could still be late. Hurry! Goodbye, mother! Dang! - Blasphemy! - It's a scandal! - Shame on you! Close the theater! - Shut up! - Ignoramus! - Dirty atheist! Fascist! - Dirty atheist! - Communist! It's incredible! Look. - What do you think of it? - It's extraordinary! Come on, hurry! Quickly, quickly! Excuse me. Are you Luis Buñuel, the director? I'm warning you, I can box and I'm armed. No, no, we loved it. - Thank you. - The dream-like images, the music and how you used that voice with a character we don't see. I've never seen anything as great in a cinema. I've never seen anything like that in a cinema. It is extraordinary. You're very kind. Are the ideas yours or Dali's? Mine. But there are some images that have a lot of Dali. Look! There's a very simple way to differentiate my ideas from Dali's. What is it? They're all mine! - Excuse me. - Yes? I was in there too but I saw no sign of Dali. And who are you? Eli Lotar, photographer and documentarian. - Like you, I want to change the world. - That's good. Look, I want to offer you this project. - What did you say your name was? - Eli Lotar. Look, Mr. Lotar, I'm very grateful, but at this moment I'd rather focus on my own projects. With this, you could help many of your compatriots in Extremadura. Please, keep it. Very well. VATICAN CITY, 1930 Your Holiness, I beg you to forgive my son Charles. He didn't know what he was doing when he invested in that film. Your Holiness, may I remind you that you were going to excommunicate him. My son is a good man but he is an idiot, he was tricked. It's all the fault of that Spanish heretic, Luis Buñuel! I will make sure he does not mock this holy institution anymore. I assure you, your Holiness, that Luis Buñuel will no longer film in Paris. What? No, Charles! You told me it was definite! But you loved the project. Buñuel? And what about Wuthering Heights? And Robinson Crusoe? Come on, Charles, look... Charles? Charles, Charles! Excuse me, do you have a light? Yes. Here you are. You have a strange accent. It's from Aragon. Where are you from? From Extremadura. We're not used to so much humidity and so much water together. Which part of Extremadura are you from? From Las Hurdes. Salvador... L'Age d'Or was too big a scandal. That's fantastic! Surrealism is winning! For some more than for others. You're doing well, Salvador. Maybe you could lend me some money? Or speak to someone who could finance my movie about Las Hurdes? A gypsy read my fortune and told me not to lend money to friends. But... I'm sorry, but I can't help you. How are things here, Ramon? As good as they can be for a poet these days. Ramén, don't be so humble. You got paid well for your last sculpture. Yes, but we invested it all in the school. Be careful, honey. Here. It's a school for the workers' children. We're short of money, but we manage. If this country isn't getting better it isn't because you aren't trying. How about you? How are you doing? Fine. Fine. Terribly. No one wants to finance my projects, Ramon. The truth is these people need someone to do something for them. Yes. Las Hurdes is the most miserable, forgotten place in the world. This time no one will be indifferent. I'll really get their attention. Yes, but... a documentary? You, the king of surrealism, making a documentary? Yes, why not? Of course, yes. I have to do it! I have to do it, Ramon. It'll be my big chance, you'll see. When are you planning to shoot? When I have the money. I was planning to get it here in Spain but... outside of Paris no one knows me. And there, my name means problems. - What about your mother? - She's fine, and yours? She's fine too, thank you. No, I mean she gave you the money to shoot Un Chien Andalou. And that's why I can't ask her again. Ramén, like in the old days. - Dammit, Luis, they'll kick us out! - Great. Get out of here! Ramén, I think I'm ruining your reputation. I think that's beyond repair now. Wait, Luis, I'll be right back. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning, sir. - Give me a lottery ticket - For this week or for Christmas? - Which one has the bigger prize? - The Christmas one. Then the Christmas one, and give me the winner! - Take this number and you'll win! - Thank you, ma'am. Look, Luis! If I win the Christmas lottery, I'll pay for your documentary. That would be really surreal! The lottery! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. One croissant and one baguette. Here you are. 1.50, please. Yes? Mr. Buñuel, you have a call from Spain. Coming! Coming. Thank you. Oui... I mean, Hello. Buñuel speaking. Luis! Luis! It's me, Ramon! - Hello Ramon! - Listen to me! Go on! Pack your bags, we're going to Las Hurdes. - What do you mean? - I won the lottery! - Are you serious? - Yes, of course! I thought you were kidding. What about your wife and daughter? Conchita would never forgive me if I don't keep my word. You're giving the money to Luis? To go off and make a movie! Come on! Ramén! Ramén! Luis! Let me take your case. For the most miserable place in Spain it looks pretty good. No, this isn't Las Hurdes yet. This is La Alberca. The documentary will begin here. Speaking of the documentary, do you have a script? Here. After two weeks on location, this is the script? This isn't a conventional movie, Ramon. This is reality. Pure, naked... What the hell...! Are you still afraid of roosters? If something that can fly decides to be so compliant I don't trust it. Why so many roosters? The boys who are getting married will rip their heads off. Are you serious? What have we got into? Come on, I'll take you to the hotel. What's this? Well, during the shooting we'll need to walk a lot, but we'll go part of the way in this. How much was this? - Like a quarter of the budget. - A quarter of the budget? And we haven't even started! Yellow Fiat.Transportation. A mere trifle. Are you sure you can drive this? Yes, it's easy, they explained it all. You move the wheel... and this little stick... Luis, be careful! So, "producer". We start in two days. Where's our cameraman? An eight. That's too much. A six, and that's all. We're in Paris. There are no sixes here. Mr. Lotar, you have a telegram from Spain. Thank you. What is it? - We're going to La Alberca. - Where's that? About 1,500 km from here. We have two days to get there. It's impossible! They won't arrive in time. Can you tell them to wait? And delay this prehistoric barbarity for you? They didn't even want you to film it. Here they come! They're not there. They must have missed it. When's the next one? - The day after tomorrow. - Damn! Did you think that this was Paris? Think about another way to start the documentary. Hey! - Welcome! - Hello, Luis. - This is Ramon Acin, the producer. - Hello. - Eli Lotar, the photographer. - Nice to meet you. Pierre Urik, he worked with me on L'Age d'Or, and he'll help me with the text and direction. - Nice to meet you. - Are you crazy? Do you know how much a taxi from Madrid costs? Not from Madrid, we took it from Paris. Sons of bitches! Come on, take the camera and let's move. - Is this a stain? - No, that's a zero. - And this? - Another zero. Good. Hurry! Shoot, Pierre. Excuse me. Good morning. I'll take that chicken, please. - Do you want me to kill it? - No, I... I'll take it to go. OK. I've got it! Hold on to it, OK? Hold on to it. Let's go, come on, hang it up. Ready! - Get the shot as close as you can. - Who'll rip off the head? - Pierre! - No, no, not a chance. Ramén, come on. Dammit, Luis, this isn't what you told me. This is another movie. - No, it's not - It's like Un Chien Andalou. No, this is reality. The head is ripped off, right? So we're not making anything up. Come on, rip off the head, and we're clone. - It's not coming off. - Pull harder! It's really tough! I can't watch this either. - It's not coming off. - Someone has to do it. Wait a minute, I'll be right back. Excuse me, I want to ask you something that might sound strange. Go ahead. If I gave you ten reales would you rip the head off? Which one? No, the rooster. Oh, the animal! I'd do that for one real, but give me ten. OK. Tell me when. Filming. Now! Until now, I hadn't found the right moment to return your book. Keep it. It's yours now. I couldn't go ahead with the project but I'm glad you can. What matters is that this documentary helps these people. These past days have been very enlightening. I know that feeling. You start to see the world in a different way. Everything has a different meaning. Do you know when they transport the hives? Soon, after the rainy season. They carry them on donkeys along those terrible paths... Sometimes, if the hive falls off, the bees kill the donkey and even sometimes the muleteer. Really? I hope we don't have to face that, right? Yes, yes, of course. Let's hope not. - Las Hurdes. - Does anyone live here? Yes, about 8,000 people in 52 villages. We're going to Las Hurdes Altas, the poorest area. Let's film! And now, the descent into hell. Luis, careful! Slow down! Luis! We're going to die! Stop complaining! What a load of babies! This is great! Such freedom! Concentrate, Luis! Why don't you use the brakes, Luis? Stop whining! Slow down! Pray to God so we can see French Catholicism! Luis, look straight ahead! It isn't that bad. Will you just look at where we are? Luis, you are never ever touching a car again, OK? Sissies! I'll never get into this car again if you're driving. Excuse me, I'm a wonderful driver and I drove magnificently. And this is what you call "hell"? I've been really bad. This is the Las Batuecas monastery. It'll be our base for filming. - Brother Joaquin! - Welcome. - How are you? - Come in, come in. Luis, how much will all of this cost? Welcome to filmmaking, Ramon. This used to belong to the Discalced Carmelites. Now there is only one monk, who rents the rooms to cover the expenses of the place. - And it isn't expensive. - We'll see... - What about the girl? - Well, the girl is from La Alberca. She'll help with the cleaning. Just cleaning? I bet there's something between the monk and her. You're unbelievable. I'll never understand why you like guns. That's a pity. If you did, you could explain it to me. But I love that stuff. Maybe I got it from my father. - It's my only vice. - And smoking. And drinking. And eating. Well, and making things harder for me. It seems that you're in a really good mood. That's a good sign, right? You know, since you called me, I haven't had a single dream. $0? That really is a good sign. Sleep well, Luis. Good night. Father, is it a puppy? - It's a cake, isn't it, father? - Even better. - What is it? - A magic lantern. Wow! - I don't like it. - It's ugly THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND Come in, come in. The show is about to begin. Enjoy our luisian elixir that comes from a distant country. Welcome! We present for you... The Great Adventure on the Mysterious Island. Our explorers arrive on an unknown island where great dangers abound. Now, our fearless adventurers will go into the dangerous Mariana Cave. - Damn! Turn that light off! - Come on, get up! Already? My god! - But we just fell asleep. - It's 4:30, come on! - So early? - I hope this isn't one of your jokes. We need time to get to where we're filming. Come on! Get up! Let's go! Have we arrived? You can't get there by car. We have a two hour walk now. - Two hours? - Come on, it could be four. Why are they looking at us like that? My stomach's in a knot. I can't eat. They'll never be able to eat like this. I'm going to give them something. Look at those vultures! Let's film them! Yes! I'll take the camera. And I'll take the tripod. What vultures? Oh, yes, the vultures, yes. I was... I'll go with you in case you get lost. Martilandran. This will be our first stop. I can't go on. Eli, let's get some general shots of the village. All these narrow, twisted streets... - It looks like a labyrinth. - A labyrinth within a labyrinth. The roofs remind me of turtle shells. Hello, how are you? Could you show us your home, good sir? Where are you from? He and I are from Aragon, like the "jota" dance. And these two men are French. Why come so far to see my home? We want to know how you live. In my country, the houses are very different. Those cigarettes you're smoking... They smell good. Yes, of course. Here, have some. Well, come in, come in. It's a very simple home. The animals, my wife, my three children and I sleep here. My other child is in his grave. Thank you, sir. We'll try not to bother you. - And do you have a light? - Of course, here you are. It smells terrible in there. Eli, let's go film inside. - What's that for? - To get light into the houses. What a contraption! We Hurdans must be really important if people come from France just to film us. You certainly are! There aren't any roosters inside, are there? No, no. A bit more to the right! OK! Oh, my god! How can... So dramatic! Time to get up! - Come on. - What time is it? Four o'clock Even earlier than yesterday? We'll have a hearty breakfast here so we don't have to eat anything in Las Hurdes. Come on, what are you waiting for? Father? Father! Father! Father! Did you know I'm a movie director now? And I'm making a movie here about Spain. It's going to be a real success. I'm sure you'd be proud of me. Father, can you look at me? Father... Well? Are you coming? Or do we have to carry you? Yes... I'm coming. What the... Dammit, Luis! We're going to fall before the goats do! Whoever told you these goats fall was lying. Come on! Let's go! We're running out of film! Ramén! We'll get as close as we can to that goat and we'll shoot it. You're a savage! We need to be true to reality. Don't be such a purist. Either we do that or we wait until it falls on its own. Pierre! Go to the top, look for a goat, and keep it there until we arrive. Eli! Eli! Focus on the goat. Try to get a good shot while it's falling. - OK! - We'll only have one chance. Filming! Eli! Did you get it? Trés bien! Perfect! We're ready! The goat and I! Keep it there! We're coming up! OK, but don't be long! Here's your supper. We found them in La Cañada Seca. - They fell. - All by themselves. Yes. Eli, prepare the camera without them noticing. Come with me. Hello! Would you mind if we took your picture? - Is that thing yours? - Yes. If you give us a ride. OK. Pierre, it's your turn. Quoi? - Faster! Go faster! - Come on! Stop, I'm getting out. I'm going to vomit! Again! Again! Please, one more time! "Faster, faster!" - Very funny. - "Hurry, hurry!" - "Quick!" - "Faster, faster!" "Faster, sir!" I don't know who's the most childish. Ramén. Tomorrow we are going to the school in Aceitunilla. That's great! You'll leave the gun here, won't you? Good night. Come in. Luis! Really! Why are you treating me like this? My lady! I'm sorry. I didn't know... But now that I've seen, I believe. I believe in you. Luis... - Luisito. - Mother? Yes, I'm the mother of every creature in the world. You too. Why do you have my mother's face? My face is the one that your eyes want to see. But now come with me, come on, I want to show you something. Slower! I can't fly! - A giraffe? - Yes, a giraffe. Now look inside. Film. There. Thank you so much for letting us film. A pleasure. For such a small village, there are a lot of children. Most of them are pilus from the orphanage in Ciudad Rodrigo. The families who take them get 15 pesetas a month from the government. Look! Goodbye! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Cut! I think we have enough for today, right, Luis? Luis! Wake up! What is it? What's wrong with her? What's wrong with that girl? I don't know, sir. She's been sick for a few days. She probably lay down to die. - You know something about first aid. - Just a little bit. Come with me. What's hurting you, little one? Down in my tummy! Can I see? Open your mouth. Eli, cut! Stop filming! Eli! I said stop! - So now we can't film? - No! She has a fever and her mouth is very inflamed. It could be pains from her first period... or something more serious. Can I have a sombreriño, sir? What's that? It's a sachet of medicine. Are you doctors? I wish we were. - We don't have medicine either. - Where could we get some? There's no medicine here. For fever we use lupines and for pains, coffee with anis. In her state, those would make things worse. So, what can we do? Just wait. Luis, I'm sorry but we can't stay here. There's a storm coming. Come on! Look on the bright side. This way, we can eat and sleep all we want. So don't worry. We're doing very well. Let it rain. - So, let it rain? - Yes, but not five clays in a row. We're here to make a movie, not for this. Will shouting make it stop? We're running out of time and money. You'll have to cut some scenes. I've edited the voiceover script so many times, it looks like shit. We still have to do Martilandran, the river, and the surroundings. We'll do them all. If you hadn't tried to fake things and ruined everything, maybe we'd be on schedule. I'm not faking things, this is a dramatization of what's happening! Yes, yes, the surrealists, what a crew. If I'd known this... Can't you breathe more quietly? Damn! Father! I'm so happy to see you! Why do you have a mustache like Dali's? You were going to take him off the credits in L'Age d'Or. And I should have. He didn't add anything to the script. That harpy Gala had corrupted everything. He was your friend! Why did you turn your back on me when I needed you most? I'm not Dali. Yes, you are Dali. Then“. That means he's inside you. - That's a lie. - He is the true surrealist! No! - You've always been his pupil. - No! Without him, you would be nothing. No, no, no! What's wrong? The dreams... they're back. I don't care about your dreams. I care about the rain. Because it's not your movie. Come on. Let's go! We can't afford to lose a minute. - I know, but where's Luis? - He usually wakes us. Are you sure we're awake? Good morning! You're supposed to scandalize the spectators, not the Hurdans! What's so scandalous? What could be more respectable than this? Come on! Take that off and let's go! Hail Mary, full of grace! It's a great day to start shooting again! Yes, it's a damn great day! I couldn't think of a better day. Aren't we lucky! There's no one here! Maybe just as well. - Mayor! - Don Ramon! How are you? You wanted to film the village and the houses, right? What's that? Mr. Buñuel had a strange idea. - That's an insult! - It's blasphemy! You said you wanted to help us, not make fun of us. Don't ask me to help with this nonsense! But, mayor, wait, I'm sorry... Well? Happy now? How was I to know I'd be a victim of religious persecution? That isn't funny! We're almost out of time and money and now you're behaving like this. Oh, Ramon... This is about portraying the true face of reality. The essence of surrealism is the division between... What the hell are you talking about? Do you hear yourself? Do you? We're supposed to be here to change things, to help these people. Not to mess around and play at being an artist. That's what Dali does, not you. Let's keep going. Ramén! Ramon! Wait! We still have time to talk to the mayor. Luis. Well! With all respect, don't you think you're going a bit too far? Look! Come on, get the camera ready. You're not going to do anything terrible, are you? Just a minute! Would you mind if we filmed you? That's it, now! Could I buy the donkey and the hives with this? - It's too much. - That's OK, keep it. Are you sure about this? Death is hiding at every corner, but it won't come out if we don't force it. Make sure you get this. Mon dieu! Filming! The donkey is suffering! Luis! Like this, and when it's in the air, you take the other one. Now, stand still, like statues. That's it. Luis, I can't do it. Now you lie down on the ground. Please, help me! Luis, come here! Look. Luis! Have you gone insane? You said he'd change! He's even worse! You're never to come back here again! You hear? - That's it! - Wait. No, no, I don't want to wait! This wasn't a game for me, you know? I have a daughter and a wife, and they've been deceived. No! We were both deceived, because we believed in you! In what we were going to do for these people. But I see you're still a rich kid except now you're playing with other people's money. Now I understand Dali, and the count, and your mother! It's impossible to work with you, this has been a huge mistake. It's over! I'm taking everything with me! This is over. We're leaving tomorrow! - But the camera is mine. - You'd better be quiet. Excuse me, ma'am. What happened to the child who was here? She had stomach ache. The poor thing died. Sir, are you all right? When's the burial? It was yesterday, they took her to Nuñomoral. - So far? - We don't have a cemetery here. Well, thank you. Have a good day. God be with you. Please! Hey! Please! Wait! Sir! Sir, is something wrong? Are you lost? I think I've been lost since I got here. Where's my shadow? And look at yours! The sun is very strong here and you see strange things. You can't fool me. You're dressed as an Hurdan and you speak like one. But you are Death. That's too dramatic. I'm just doing my job. - Have you come for me? - I'm always very busy here. No, please, not yet! Please, I still have a lot to do. If you haven't done it before, it can't be that important. But l... "Me, me, me..." The living only care about things when they lose them. I'm not important, but what I need to tell is. Then tell it, come on, now. Here and now? I can't. I'm alone. I see. Wait, where are you going? Is that all? Have you nothing more to say? Aren't you taking me? And who said I was coming for you? Eli! Eli, wake up! What is it? There's something we need to do. Wake Pierre. - The three of us are going out. - And Ramon? It's best if we don't wake him. Aren't we leaving this morning? No, we need to keep filming. Ramén will understand. Come on. OK, you know him better. Pierre, wake up! Luis? What the...! Where's the car? Your friends left a moment ago. Good morning. Go on, go home! Ma'am, think of your little boy in heaven now, with the angels, playing, laughing. And every time you look up at the sky, you'll see him, playing with the clouds. Luis, are you crying? Me? Not at all. Come on, shoot now. Go ahead! Go ahead! Come on! Keep going! Shoot! Camera! Action! Cut! Really good, thank you so much. Ma'am, thank you, really. Luis! I'm sorry. I've never heard you say that before. It's an awful word. It's one thing to be provocative, and another to screw over your friends. I'll leave that to Dali. I'm sorry if I gave you a hard time, but... I know, Luis, this is your big opportunity. No, it's the only opportunity for these people. You can tell me how you managed to organize all this. I bought the kid, with your money, so now he's yours. What? You can go to hell! Damn, my feet! We still have a lot to film. We're almost out of money. We've got just enough to rent the moviola. Ramonin, don't worry. We'll keep filming and figure out how to do it. You scare me! I'm coming! I'm coming! Hello, Ramon! How long have you shut away in here? I don't know, but it's almost finished. Hot off the presses! I mean really hot! What a set-up you have here! We have to celebrate, right? Have a couple of rosés. Of course. Where's the wine? There it is. - Ramon, to Las Hurdes. - To Las Hurdes. On July 18,1936, civil war broke out in Spain. Ramén Acin was executed by Franco's army on August 6, 1936. His wife, Conchita Monras, was executed 17 days later. We regret to inform you that Don Ramon... In late 1936,The Republican government allowed the release of Las Hurdes, tierra sin pan, but removed Ramon Acin from the credits because he was a known anarchist. In 1960 Luis Buñuel, now recognized as one of the great names in cinema, re-released Las Hurdes, tierra sin pan. He restored Ramon Acin's name in the credits and gave the proceeds to Ramon’s daughters, Katia and Sol.
