They came The fourth one. Oh... Hey! She's here... Mary's here... Is all that stuff about Mary true? A ghost? Well, a lot of weird things are happening. You got a point. Maeda's cooped up at home and doesn't come to work. Noon. Time for lunch. You going? Yeah. When our manager and the chief say they have an "inspection", they mean golf. Man, I'd like to go on holiday or something, too. I need some kinda pastime. What do you do on your day off, Fujimoto? Skateboarding? Yeah, stuff like that. - Fujimoto. - Sir! Starting today, you're in charge of the site. The site? You heard about Maeda, right? - Yes. - That's why. Do a good job. Huh? But! Maeda made a list of mediums to perform rites. Psychic mediums? Get the list and hit them up. And then what? Get yourself blessed, then tear that dance hall down. Use your head. Place looks creepy... Let's see... which ones haven't been contacted. Yes, I see... Give me your palm. Okay. Oh, yes... "Taoka Psychic Research Facility". It's gonna be another joke. Anyway, best to stay away from this place. Yep, I gotta agree. As I explained just now... Fool! Playing around in a place like that will bring catastrophe! No, it's my job. I want to tear it down! Oh, that's right. In that case, let's work our old magic. You're fired up. That's it. I'm goin' home! Me, too. You're leaving? Too powerful! Fierce paranormal energy! Quick, run away! Don't wanna go back tomorrow... Maybe I'll let a ghost possess me and take a day off. Stories about Mary are spreading around town. What if crazy talk like that delays construction? The fact is, six construction workers got injured trying to start. And four local psychics ended up in hospital. People are selling charms at exorbitant prices and "exorcists" are raking in money. More than just a delay, there will be scared residents staging demonstrations. There must be a solution. Can't we just leave the dance hall standing where it is? No way we can do that, dummy! Grand Square West will have 12 floors and two basements, with sports facilities and a hotel. The east tower will have residences and a shopping complex with 19 floors and a basement level. Ain't any room for a dance hall! But lida Construction said they're pulling out due to fear. What if the plans are changed and the dance hall can stay... Isn't it a little late for that? But... What if we bring in the yakuza? Right That is an option. Those guys won't get cold feet about all this. But it'll cause trouble later on... The yakuza have always handled dirty work like this, right, Chief? Indeed. At times like this, you call the yakuza. Good. Subcontract it out to Kuramoto Construction. Understood. Kaboom. We're gonna demolish that dance hall. And blow all those rumors away. Very good, Sir. Let's make a show of it. And the demolition date? Right. The sooner the better. In three days. Three days from now, it’ll be gone. Fujimoto! Sir. You stay in charge of that site. Um, but I'm... A psychic, huh? You don't know any? Nope. I saw an amazing one on TV, in the UK... It'll be too late. Late or not, it's gonna be demolished anyhow. That’s no good. I'm in charge. What if I get cursed? - Don't worry so much. - I'm freakin' out. It's a ghost. A real ghost! How about a little sympathy? The yakuza are taking care of everything. Don't sweat it. Ghosts are scary enough. Now the yakuza... Best to just follow their lead. That doesn't put me at ease. I can't take this! - Trade with me! - Good lunch. About that subsidy. I think we need to hold another review. I was thinking the same thing. Most companies don't have citizens' best interests in mind. - She can see them. - See what? Ghosts. Seriously? Yep. And she can predict things that are going to happen and even read people's minds. That's like supernatural powers. I saw this movie on video. "Carrie"! Exactly like that! Everyone was grossed out by her and she stopped going to school. Her homeroom teacher came to you to discuss it? Right. So... Did you meet her? Yeah. She seemed like a good girl, but when I thought about her powers I got freaked. Totally. Um... Would you mind telling me a little more about what you were discussing? Hello? Sorry to bother you. I'm an employee from city hall. Please excuse me. Hello? Anybody? Somebody! What the...?! Miss? Are you all right? People are just awful. Poor girl was used as a plaything. And still in high school. Must be "compensated dating". Don't pretend you can't hear us. What do you do? Me? Your job. We're asking you a question, Mr. Suit and Tie. An interrogation? Basically, yes. Answer the question, please. Civil servant. - I knew it. - No surprise. Always teachers and civil servants. A nerd like you doesn't even read gossip rags? Slacking off work and getting all horny. I'm not horny! What's that attitude? We're citizens. Mr. Pedo puts on a tie and acts big. Just leave me alone before I get angry. Were you serious about her? You've probably never been serious about anything. If you're not serious about work or fun, it just becomes boring. Being alive and living are different, you see? You're a clock-watching civil servant who just lets life pass him by. Oh, and your lives are so exciting? They sure are, because we're living life. We both have cancer. We could die anytime. That's why we live each day to the fullest. Why do you think you were born into this world? How can I answer that? Every person comes into this world with a specific purpose. No such thing as a purposeless life. The most important thing is "now". Do what you should be doing. If you truly live in the present, — you can change the future. It's because we have a purpose that we're so alive. Even meeting you here today has meaning behind it. There is no "chance". Everything is inevitable. How you use this encounter is what matters. You became a civil servant because it's stable. You had no intention of making citizens' lives better. That's no good! What's your purpose? It's to help citizens. That's your meaning in life. You were chosen to be — a civil servant. That's why it's okay if you're a pedo. Live in the moment. Right. You might have issues. But don't worry about being a pedo. But, I'm not... Sure, some people might look down on you. But it's okay. It's a preference. Ignore other people. Right. Just accept that you're a pedo. I am not a pedophile! Stop making a disturbance. This is a patient room! I apologize, but these two ladies... Just quiet down! I'm sorry... How come I have to get chewed out? "Yasaka Shrine" (Good luck charms) Here, take this. Mr. Manager... Who do you think we are? Because you're doin' this on the sly we have to swallow this? City hall has to do things fairly. Right, Chief? Well... Sure... Leave it to us. When you're in trouble we help each other out. But, it's just a demolition, so... - You don't trust us or something? - Of course we do. Were doin' you a big favor, motherfucker! of course... we understand perfectly. As I mentioned, it's only a demolition... How ‘bout I demolish your house? We'll handle everything. From top to bottom, Chief. Urban planning... It's a big responsibility. We wanna build a great town. First of all, let's look over the plans. Yes. Hey, go get my ruler from the office. To measure? I have to draw lines and stuff. Oh, yeah. Go get mine, too! Got it. Grand Square, east and west... Where should our office go? In the ea 4 tower with the shopping mall, no? But the hotel's on the other side. You can doze there when you're beat. True... Better have one on both sides. Good idea. Boss. We have to join the committee meetings. When's the next one? This afternoon. Perfect. We can all go in together. Right, Chief? To the committee meeting? We're partners now. Joining committee meetings is natural. That's... We'll need to bring other partners on board, too. We'll offer a public contract. Fair is fair. Is this about Mary? The rumors are spreading everywhere. It's not good. I heard that you... can see ghosts and stuff? I have no supernatural powers. Just curious how you see them... You can see them, too. No way! I don't have an ounce of ability. Was that a... ghost? Sorry. Let's forget this. I shouldn't involve you. I want to try. My mind's made up. Not a good idea. Kinu and Kayo at the hospital said it. I have a purpose. They made some good points, but they said some dubious things, too. Like I'm a pedo, or a homo and stuff like that. And I feel like I have a greater purpose in life. But enough about me. If anything happened to you... You have school. I... don't want to give up. Hey! Are you all right? So Mary's been waiting for her boyfriend all these years? They made a promise to meet there. Her and Johnny. - "Johnny"? - Right. The boyfriend's name? Correct. He looks Japanese to me. We have to search him out. Where would we even look? Haunted places. What?! We have to ask questions and look around. You mean ask... Ghosts. Why do I have to do these things? Is this my job? Bullshit... This is bullshit. It's hopeless... Johnny's already gone to heaven, no? I think I've already done my part. I'm sure Mary knows that. Anyway, it's getting late. Don't get me wrong. I'm not scared of these ghosts or anything. Look, you're underage so I can't be walking around with you late at night. And there have been muggings recently. I'm not trying to frighten you. I'm just concerned. If something happens, I can't look the other way. Nothing good comes of violence... Sorry. Im really not trying to scare you. I was just... There. Hey! What are you punks doin'?! Hey! What is this? See? You're slow as shit and now he's back. You two, get away from my vehicle. I'll call the police! Shut the fuck up. Call them and do what? I can forgive a prank. I have work to do. I'm in quite a hurry. What is this crap? It's worthless. Hey, stop that! I tried to live my life without standing out. But if I just hide in a corner, I'll be disrespected, and bullied for no reason. All the anger bottled up inside of me will explode... Then I'll be more alone than ever. As far as helping me out, I think you should call it quits. I’m OK being spooky. Huh? But you heard what Kinu and Kayo said, right? Every person comes into this world with a specific purpose. But saying that is such a big burden. If we think everything has some grand meaning, we're too nervous to act. But it's better than just giving up. I see your point, but we don't have to be so serious. Let's be more laid back. That’d make it more fun. What's she so angry about? No idea... You act all sensitive like you understand people's feelings. But you don't get how I feel. My head's spinning and I wanna go home. Maybe I'll just take off. Joke. Just a joke. Excuse me? Do you know this man? He's being held captive? Yeah. Johnny? Yeah! Why can't he escape? He's a ghost! Don't ask me. That's what I was told. Hey, can't ghosts go where they like? So annoying... Just be quiet. This place is creepy as hell. Let's go. I don’t need to go in there. What are you saying? I don't have those powers. It's not my purpose. Stop draggin' your feet! Wait! Look. They're...here. They look dangerous. - We're going. - No way. This guy. C'mon. Do you... know this person? That cat is over in Taiwan. Taiwan? What you want him for? I want to bring him home. No chance in hell. Why not? Guy owed money at our gambling den. So we sold him to the Taiwanese mob. You sold him? How old are you, girl? Could make a killin' off of you. But... you don't have a need for money anymore, right? What, asshole? Be-because... you're already dead. Money has no meaning. Lucky! You don't have to work. You guys have already passed away. I can't... Can't accept that! We're not goddamn dead! But look, you're totally... Are you fuckin' with us? I'll ice you! Run! Hurry! Get back here! You're a dead man! Are you okay? That was dangerous, huh? Yeah... Rough night. You can't depend on this guy. If I was a little younger, those punks would be goners. I had some killer arms on me. If my cold gets any worse sleeping here. I'm a goner. Geez... What's with your attitude, after I helped you out? It's nothing. So what do you do? I'm a civil servant. It's your fault! Nobody looked out for me. That's why I'm dying in a place like this. Apologize! Say sorry! Pardon me? It's your own fault. Don't put the blame on others. - How can you...? - What? Treat people like garbage. No good tax thief! Don't act high and mighty if you didn't pay yours. I had reasons. Reasons! Whatever. Don't take it out on me, man! Bastard! I dare you to say that again! You don't know my story. You just mock people. Look down on them. Just a little longer... "Grand Square" and I could've stood on my own two feet. "Redevelopment" they said, and kicked us all out. Always spewing your "logic". Don't any of you have basic empathy for people? in hell here. Shit! Sister, can I ask you a favor? - What is it? - Here. Come over here. Take the blanket off. I didn't want anybody to see me this way. - Can I ask you to pray for me? Then I can rest in peace, I think. Thank you. Thank you... My body feels so light. It feels wonderful. My time has finally come. Oh, not far from here is an abandoned mansion. There's a legendary yakuza there known as "Thousand Cuts". He'll help you out, for sure. At one time, a wooden statue of the great king Enma stood in this place. As king of the underworld, Enma would judge a soul's time on earth, not unlike a court. You both, did a good deed. That homeless man was overjoyed he could go to paradise. As for me, I have killed countless people. Even if I do good deeds now, my fate won't change. If I'm to spend an eternity in hell, I may as well go... on a final rampage. Whatever clan it is, if they laid a hand on a civilian cut them to pieces. Shall I take your cup away? Thank you, Sir. So even ghosts can have a fear of flying? Got some time, maybe I'll watch a movie. How exactly... did you lose your life? I was betrayed, and poisoned. Dead or not, I'm a yakuza forever. What? Are you serious? Oh. this? If I don't do this, I can't speak to you. If I don't hold her hand. I can't see you. Can't look at me? Are you interested in men? No, I mean I can't see ghosts. You're scared? You don't get it. They're not visible to me. I can't understand you. If she's not with me. I can't do this. You'll really say anything in front of people. You have no shame? - No, you're misunderstanding. - Just playing around? I'm not playing. If you're just toying with her, you'll pay for it. What are you talking about? I'm not. Have you ever been serious about anything in your life? - Again... - A man takes action, has firm convictions, must balance emotion with duty. A man burdened with duty... ... honors his word above his name. That is what a man is. Am I wrong? No, you're right. I lived without women. Women are a sacred thing. Far more noble than us. For a man to frivolously hold a woman's hand... There... (Mandarin) There's nothin' to do... I'm so sluggish these days. You don't look so good. Better get a checkup. I don't like doctors. What if I have some rare disease? It's an ambush! We've come from Japan to bring this man home. Tell us where he is. Or you'll die again! Hah! This guy's in tatters. Let's go. Okay! Stop! Ouch! I am Seiji Handa, of the Koda clan. One of our young members seems to have caused you trouble. I've come to collect him. That's not possible. He caused trouble on our turf. You haven't paid compensation for disrespecting our business. Are you suggesting a finger? Your turf, or your life. You'll decide which, here and now. Pump one into me. What's wrong? If you're going to aim, aim here. Seiji Handa of the Koda clan is here. Where's Andoji? You bastard! Okay... Let's negotiate. We can make a deal. Big brother! Be glad. I struck a deal. Thank you! That's our big brother! My body... My body feels so light. Thank you. Finally... I can be at peace. Are you finished? May I take that? Wow! What's this? I can watch movies on this thing? That's wild! Are we flying? We're flyin'! What do you mean "home"? Where Mary is. Screw that. She'll be angry. She'll be furious with me, for sure. You think she's cool? Nope, definitely furious. Mary's been waiting. She's been waiting for you. That may be true, but when she's angry it's super scary. Let's have some fun in this weather. How can you say that? She's been waiting and you don't care? Waiting year after year and you treat it like nothing? Why are you freaking out? Okay! I'll drop in and say hello. But before that let's go somewhere fun. Let's see... How 'bout bowling? I'm kiddin'. I haven't talked in forever, so I'm nervous. What's wrong? Big Brother should've killed him. Such a jerk. I'm done with him. Hey, can you lend me some cash? - Money? - Yeah. I can't meet Mary lookin' like this. Let's hit a boutique. Sammy's just got in a new salmon-pink suit, ya know? Well... A man has to be well-dressed. - I need flowers, too. - Flowers? Say... are these wheels yours? The city office's. Ugly rides like this are what people drive now? Unbelievable. Get some American wheels. That's cool. Can't pick up chicks in this. Hey, got any gum? You sure they can do this? It should turn out okay. You're irresponsible. Too late now, we've hired them. What's that attitude? You suggested hiring the yakuza. What are you talking about? You're the one who said yakuza have always done dirty work like this. You were supposed to call Kuramoto Construction, not the yakuza's office. It would've turned out the same way. You ordered the job, you take responsibility. I just made the call that you directed me to make. And you screwed up and signed with the yakuza directly! - You said "It's time to call the yakuza"! - That was Chief. Hey. Don't push this onto me. - You accepted... -I was being threatened! You're too timid, failin' for a threat like that. - Son of a bitch! - Shoulda had the guts to turn them down. Anyway, I'm just an observer here, so you both take the lead. I'm busy with other work. And where's Fujimoto? He's supposed to watch the site. I haven't seen him around lately. - Probably took off. - I knew it. Dick! We need to assign someone else. Who should that be? Good question. Mishima isn't afraid of threats, let's put him in charge. Perfect. Are you serious? - I'm not doing it! - Come on now, this is your job. Stop being a stubborn child. What's wrong, Mishima? Scared? I'll blow the whistle. I'll expose all the underhanded shit you've done until now! Try it if you think you can. But you won't skate clean. -	Um... -	What? What?! Oh, hello. Thank you for coming! Wow! This whole area's changed. Wait a sec. Gone. It's totally gone! That was the best restaurant, I swear. No way... It's all different now. Man... Mary's been waiting, huh? Hey, how do you dance to the music? How do you... know how to.... dance to the music? . (Vibrations.) What's that? (Say something.) Talking? Oh, vibrations. I get it. Can you feel it? I. Love. You. I, l, o, v, e, y, o, u. Yum. And this. Thank you. Our new place. Apartment 206. I sign today. I'll pick you up later. (I’ll wait. However long it takes.) (I trust you, so I'll wait. Forever.) "Jubatacho Residence, Apt. 206" Hey. Get up! What the...? What's wrong? It was a joke. Just a joke. Why so serious? Wait. It was a stupid joke. Don't get angry. Hold on a second, Man. What is this? Hey! I get it. Mary's been waiting. I have to say sorry. Hey! Take me to Mary. I have to apologize. The dance hall. Is it still there? Yeah, but it's scheduled to be demolished today. Today? Tentatively. What time? Noon. Hurry up, or I won't make it on time! Can this ride go any faster? I'm going the speed limit. We'll just make it. "Just" ain't good enough. Mary's waiting! She's been waiting for me. Now hit the gas! What's the panic? Mary's been waiting years. Decades! Just for me. I wanna get there. I wanna see her! If I'm late I may never see her again. I'd be the biggest loser... I'm beggin' you! Hold on. Here we go. The white car ahead. Pull over. What did you do, man? You gotta watch out. They were hiding. I couldn't. Now what? Stop the car. Pull over onto the shoulder. What the fuck are you doing?! I'll explain to them... Shit! What happened? Yo. Johnny? -	Pull over. -	Shut the fuck up! I'm not playin' around! Hold on, Mary. I'm comin' to you. Shit... Up ahead! Swerve! Kinu and Kayo! Good job. Hello, Gentlemen. Thank you for coming all 'this way. Over here, please. Demolition day, huh, Chief? The day is here. That's the dance hall? Yes, that's it. What’s this? The switch? Yes. I press that and it goes boom? It’s almost ready. Okay, let's blow this thing. - Let's do this. - Just a moment, please. Local residents have been told the demolition will happen at exactly noon. Could you please wait another five minutes? You've got some balls, makin' our boss wait. I didn't mean... Stop screwin' around and press the button, asshole! You want me to? I don't know much about how these things work. Say what? You just press the button. - Well, it's not that I believe in curses but my fingers aren't in the best shape. Be my guest. Don't fuck with me! I didn't mean to... Wait, what are you doing?! I'll help ya. - Stop! Don't! Stop it, please! We made it. Halt the demolition! Fujimoto! What the hell is this about? Stop the demolition. Please! My girl's in there! You've lost your mind! Please, Sir! It's true. Don't destroy the building! You're both crazy! Mary! Who's that? Fujimoto was assigned to watch the site. Why is he losing it? Maybe he couldn't find an excuse for being late, so he's performing. Youngsters these days are clever bastards. There are a lot of irrational people around. It's a pain. Mary! He made it just in time. Give him the switch. Hurry up and press it, asshole. C'mon, help me! - Stand up straight. - Stand up, Fujimoto. Here we go! Johnny... That felt good, huh, Chief? Quite a sight, isn't it? Its a job well done. Indeed. We can all learn from it. -	Chief. -	Yes? Let's do things the yakuza way from now on. We're countin' on ya. Dammit... Chief? Now what? There could be problems. Beats me. This all happened because we were given the runaround by ridiculous curses and ghosts. Hey. You. Fool. Why are you cryin’? Let go! - Chief! - Are you okay? Fujimoto, stop! Stop it! It's the curse! Just calm down! What's with him? You shithead! Get off me. C'mere! Tough guy, huh? - Thinks he can fuck with us. - Now look at ya. What a joke. I've never... really tried. I don't know... the pain of defeat or the joy of victory. If you don't do anything you'll never win. Johnny... Johnny! Wait... You saw them? Wow... I did. Could this be... my purpose? Gimme a break! For sure... There's a reason for everything. I just... I just wanna be normal! Normal's good! What the hell? I don't get life...
