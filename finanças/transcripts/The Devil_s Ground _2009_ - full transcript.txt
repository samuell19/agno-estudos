Man says it's gonna rain today. So... this next song. He killed him. He'll kill you too. It's my car, Richard, not yours. I'll smoke if I want. Shit. My God. Fill 'er up? Yes, please. And can you check the oil too? Sure. Pop the hood. This your place? Yep. Gas Hog. Cute name. California? Travelin' far? Bangor. - You been there? - No. Too far for this Pennsylvanian. You're looking at another, what? Five, six-hour drive still. - Yep, somethin' like that. - Oil's good. Great. How much is that? You okay? Gonna be a cold one tonight. Nights like this, I don't even wanna leave the station. All right. I don't mean to frighten you, miss, but are you sure you wanna drive all the way to Bangor tonight? Um, what time is it? Just after 9:00. Geez. I don't know where the time goes. How much was that? You could stay at the hotel and leave first thing in the morning. It'd be safer. - Thanks, um... - Jimmy. Jimmy. It's really nice of you to be concerned, but I've gotta get going. Thirty-nine. Excuse me? The gas. Thirty-nine dollars. Of course. I'm sorry. Here you go. Here's 40. Keep the change. Thanks. Have a nice night. Jesus, you ever hear such crap? Lord. Weird. Help me. Fuck. You must have been on crack when you chose this route. Jesus Christ. Holy shit. Are you fucking nuts? I almost hit you. I'm talking to you! Help me. Okay. Stay away from me. No. No, Please. You don't understand. He's coming. He's out there looking for me right now. Listen, I don't want any trouble. I just want to get back in my car and... Is that blood on your face? Please. Please, let's go. Please, before he finds us. Before who finds us? - How did you get out here? - My friends. Where are they now? They're dead. Okay, we're gonna drive to the nearest town... and we're gonna get you some help. Okay? I'm sorry. Here. Want one? Okay. Shit. Goddamn. You got a name? No? Amy. You say something? Amy. Amy Singer. My name is Amy Singer. Okay, good. That's a start. How are you feeling? Are you cut? Are you hurt bad? I'm fine. None of the blood is mine. Okay. Well, you wanna tell me what the fuck you were doing... all the way out here in the middle of nowhere? You wanna tell me how long you've been out here? What day is it? Friday. The 19th. November 19. Two days. - It's only been two days. - Sweetie. Listen, you're gonna have to tell me what happened, okay, so I understand. Why don't you start from the beginning, all right? There were five of us... Mike, Greg, Tammy, Lisa and me. We came out here to study some land... designated for a coal mining operation. - You're a student? - At Boston U. Our environmental studies professor... approached us with a proposition. He had heard about... a possible Indian burial ground in these parts, and he believed if we could find the site, we could stop the destruction about to take place. Find the site. Stop the mining. Guarantee ourselves a pass. Seemed like a good idea at the time. So we packed our gear, and we came out to do our research. Jesus, Mike. Maybe next time you can rent one with a working toilet. Dig that tattoo, Tams. Fuck off, Greg. Greg, you wanna stop showing her what you don'thave? - Mike, how much further, man? - We just have to make one more stop for gas. Are you kidding me? We're gonna spend all of next year's tuition just getting there. What we spend on fuel we save on motel fees, Lise. - This is way more economical. - And convenient. This way we can park right at the site, and first thing tomorrow morning go straight to work. Somebody's keyed. Bradford? Isn't this where they lost all those coal miners? Yeah. December 19, 1967. Hey, did you know it was the worst mine disaster... in Pennsylvania history? Tammy? Maybe you could spare us the history lesson. 239 people died, Greg. Well, I just can't believe no one was ever prosecuted for it. It's hazards of the job, Amy. What? It's hazards of the job. And you want to be an environmentalist? One day. For who, the Young Republicans? Okay, our job is to protect the environment from destruction, and doing that, we protect the human race as well. But more often than not, environmentalists scare people into believing... that industry is solely to blame, when, in fact, there's no real proof of that. What about record rainfalls in Asia, and... Unbearable heat in Europe? The super-storms and the winds happening right now in America... That's not proof to you? Not to mention the melting ice caps. You know what? I'm gonna decide for myself what's natural and what's not, and then I'll report it responsibly. Jesus, Greg, you are a FOX News junkie if I ever saw one. To you, whitewashing lies is the same as telling the truth. It's simple economics, Mike. There's no argument. It's oil, gas and coal now. In 10 or 15 years, it's gonna be plutonium. Maybe sooner. What do you think the people are gonna want the government to do then? I don't know. Ask them. What, now? No, ask them then. Ask them when the motors stop, and it's cold at home, and they've run out, and the people who aren't used to hunger go hungry. They're not gonna want to have to ask. They're gonna expect the government to get it for them. The world's economy runs on fossil fuels, and until we find an alternative energy source, mines are gonna collapse, wars are gonna be fought, and, unfortunately, those who die to provide us with the energy we require... are gonna be considered collateral damage. - Just like the Bradford coal miners. - That's cold, Greg. It's the truth, Mike. Without gas, how do we make it to Arrowhead? Speaking of which, can we leave? Yeah. Let's kick her. Okay, you guys. Sick. How cool is this place? Can you say tetanus? Don't touch anything. You're staring at a piece of American history. You got that right, girl. Go on and get inside the house, boy. - It's not done! - Go on, get! You want somethin'? We need some gas. Well, you'll have to pump it yourself. And likewise if you want your oil checked. Are these self-serve rates? Greg? Yeah? Can you please check the oil? Okay. Do you have coffee here? Sure, I do. Shit. Listen... Billy. I just wanted to apologize. For? For the way we were staring at you. It was rude. Don't be, ma'am. I... I get it all the time. Excuse me, sir? Do you have any change? Let me help. Lisa. Thank you, ma'am. Amy. Shh! Shh! Stubs has taken a liking to you. Amy, even you have to admit he's a bit of a freak. Drop it, all right? Probably 'cause she's wondering what it would be like... to have one of those stubs wedged between her legs. Amy! God, what are you doing sneaking up on me... like that? What are you doin' back here anyway? What's in your barn? Just my dog. The mangy thing lives in there. Doesn't sound like a dog. It was... grunting or... It looked... What, you saw it? No. I didn't see it. Amy? What's going on? Did he touch you? - No, he didn't touch me, Greg. I was just startled. - By what? Billy's dog. Billy's dog? Let it go, Greg. It's getting late. We've gotta get going if we're gonna make it to Arrowhead by nightfall. Arrowhead? What kind of business y'all have up there? Research. We're students. We're just... We're doing an environmental assessment on the land. Just mostly soil samples. Why? Billy? We're wasting our time here. Let's get lost. Here. That oughta cover our gas bill. He's just being overprotective, Billy. Ignore him. I can appreciate overprotectiveness. It was nice to meet you. The Devil's Playground. Pardon me? That place y'all goin'. Some folk call it the Devil's Playground. "The Devil's Playground." Those were his exact words. Jesus. Did you tell the others? Amy? What happened next? Despite our late arrival, and what had happened back at the station, everything was going as planned. Mike parked the motor home as close to the site as possible, and... there we prepared our equipment for the next day. It had been one hell of a day for all of us, so, knowing the real work was just starting, we turned in early. I was exhausted, and once my head hit the pillow, I was out like a light. That night, nothing would keep me awake. Not even Greg and Lisa screwing in the next room over. Nothing except... That's not you, is it? No. Guys, what... what is this? What's that shaking? - Not funny! We get it. - Guys, what's going on? What is that? Jesus. What was that? What the fuck was that? Was it an earthquake? Do you think it was an earthquake? Yeah. What the fuck? Maybe it was just a tremor. My God! Greg! Greg! My God. What is going on? My God! What the fuck was that? Do you see anything? What do you suppose it could be? Greg... Greg, don't go out there. Well, I'm glad we got talked into all that extra insurance coverage. Not funny, Greg. Wasn't meant to be. Our tools. For Christ's sakes, Mike, forget about the tools. That prick's fucking with us. Who the hell are you talking about? We're even now, Billy. You managed to scare the shit out of everybody here, including me. Good work! Now why don't you and your buddies just head on home... and jerk each other off in celebration, okay? Good night, Billy! He's gone. Hey, where you going? I'm gonna get some shut-eye. Anyone with me? What about the tools? Forget about the tools. We'll get them in the morning. Wait for me, Greg. I don't know about him sometimes. I'm scared, Mike. That was their intention. Come on. Maybe we should leave. What Billy said at the station... he was warning us. That was a warning. - We already discussed this, Amy. - This could be sacred ground. What if it's the natives? What if they think we're part of the mining company? You know how sensitive they can be. Come on. Let's get some sleep. I just couldn't shake that awful feeling... we were being watched. Were you? Nothing else happened that night. Well, what happened next? The next day was spectacular... Perfect working conditions. But we couldn't find anything. I was ready to give up... when Greg called out he'd hit pay dirt. I was skeptical at first, but when I saw the arrowhead... Greg of all people had just saved the park... and guaranteed us all passing grades. But the real excitement came when we started... to exhume the bones... Human bones. Hundreds of years old. They were everywhere. It truly was the mother lode. What have you got there? Nice pelvis. Good work.Thanks. I think it's gonna rain. Hey, guys? The clouds are rolling in. What do you say we pack up and take off back to the Winnie? It's about fuckin' time, Mike. Nice work, Lise. Hey, guys. Let's wrap it up, babe. It's time to go. What have you got there? Looks like the upper palate. Pretty good shape? I'd say. Best one so far. I didn't realize they did dentistry back then. - What are you talking about? - It's got gold fillings in it. Impossible. The natives never practiced dentistry. Are you sure? Let me see that. Where'd you find this? Here. Why? Mike. It didn't take us long to figure out what Mike was thinking. Tammy tried to discount his thoughts, told him that dentists had been practicing the procedure for at least a hundred years. Mike wasn't so sure. There's an inscription on the back. "With love, Mary." "2002." The graves were shallow... Far more so than the native ones we were digging up earlier. Got to the point where we'd just kick the ground, and out popped the skeletal remains of some poor, unfortunate soul. We're dealing with a monster. Burying solid gold necklaces, bracelets... Fucker didn't do it for personal gain. That Rolex alone is worth 50 grand. Some of the bodies are in the early stages of decomposition. Mark this place on the map. What the fuck? Greg, tell me you didn't leave the keys in the motor home. Come on! What happened next? Amy? Amy, what happened next? Lisa was missing. - Help me! - Lisa! What do you want? - No! No! - My God! No! No, no, no, no, no! Stop it! Stop it, please! You're killing her! No! God. Shh! Quiet. My God. No! - Lisa! - No! Shit. Shit! Get up! What the fuck? Come on! Fuck! What? You spineless fuck! Keep your fuckin' voice down. You're a piece of shit. That monster is coming after all of us. We gotta stick together here, because if we don't, none of us will make it through the night. I got scared. We're all scared, Greg. Then why didn't I try... There wasn't anything we could do. We could have fuckin' done something to fuckin' stop it! You gotta believe me, there wasn't anything we could do. Fuck. Fuck. I owe you an apology. Aah! Shit! Motherfucker! Fuck! I wondered if I was awake. Perhaps it was just a nightmare, and I was actually asleep in my bed, safe beneath my blankets. Then that monster trained his eyes on us. Before I picked you up, I stopped at a gas station, and I saw this guy, and I think... He had to kill, but... He craved the hunt as much, if not more. Amy, is it possible... that maybe you made this guy up in your mind? I don't mean that he doesn't exist. I mean, is it... Is it possible that you might have... distorted his image, that you... Turned him into some kind of a monster because he'd done such horrible things? Are you sure? As sure as I am sitting here in this car with you right now. But... Carrie. I know what I saw. - We'll be safe here. - Thank God. The sun will be up in a few hours. We'll be able to move faster then. - Can I have the map? - What for? So we can find another route back to the highway. No. I'm not going anywhere, Mike... Not with that thing lurking around. Don't get crazy on me now, Tammy. There's no time for this. Look, guys, it won't be long before somebody reports us missing. Only two people know we're out here... the professor and Billy. We know that maniac's secret. That son of a bitch out there knows this place like nobody else. He wants us. He's a hunter, and he will find us. Now, may I please have that map? Thank you. It's okay, Tammy. How long you think it would take us to get to the Gas Hog? On foot? God, I don't know. Most of the day, that's for sure. Billy warned us not to come out here. If we can make it back to that station, I'm sure he'll help. Where's Tammy? Where is she? Where's Tammy? Tammy? Tammy? Where are you? Christ. For fuck's sake. What? Now I need your permission to pee? You deal with her. For fuck's sake. Did I do something wrong? Stop it, Tammy. Better keep quiet or the Hog man will get you. Amy, wait up. Amy, stop. Promise it won't happen again. You have to promise, Tammy. Tammy? Did you say something? Forget it. Let's get the hell out of here. I knew you couldn't leave me out here with... Tammy! Tammy! No! Run, Amy! Hide! Come on, Amy. Come on, Amy. Come on. Come on. Come on. Jesus Christ, Amy, come on. He's not that far behi... Mike! Are you hurt? I just got the wind knocked out of me. That's all. Can you climb out? Fuck. I'm in deep shit, Amy. Maybe I... Maybe I can... Shit. Mike, he's coming. Hide. My God. Mike? Mike! I thought we were dead. - He'll... He'll be back. - Yeah. Yeah. What do we do now? Yeah. Yeah, well, we don't do anything, Amy. You gotta go alone. I'm not leaving you here, Mike. Maybe... Maybe I can find a branch or... You won't find one long enough. This hole's way too deep. Goddamn it, Mike. We have to try. There's gotta be another way. There's no other way, Amy. Look. Look! I'm fucking trapped with no chance in hell of getting out. Face it. You gotta go. Otherwise shovel the dirt over me now, 'cause I'm not going anywhere. Here. Take this. Stick to the markings I made. Stayoff the highway. Travel parallel to it. Don't show that to anybody but the police. You got me? Okay. You better get going if you're gonna make it back here before dark. I'm sorry, Mike. Forget about it. Just make sure you bring a long rope when you get back, okay? Yeah. Yeah. I made it back to the station with plenty of daylight... left to go and rescue Mike. Do you understand my feelings? I assume you told Billy everything. I told him about the graves, told him Greg, Tammy and Lisa were dead, told him about Mike trapped in a crevice, and about the monster responsible for all of it. And what was his reaction? Not exactly what I expected. Goddamn it all. I warned y'all not to go out there, didn't I? You didn't exactly tell us there was a killer on the loose, Billy. You could have been a little more specific. Right. And a warning just ain't good enough... for you smart college kids, now is it? Look. I just wanna get to Mike before anything bad happens to him. Are you gonna help me or not? There's a rope over there by the pop machine. I'd fetch it myself, but, well, these fuckin' hooks ain't worth a damn. Of course, it might help if I was to lubricate them once in a while. Hey, it's Billy. You better go on, pull that truck around. Never mind why. Get your dumb ass over here now. We got trouble up there at Arrowhead. That's some rough country up there, girl. I'm amazed that you made it out in such fine shape. Well, if I didn't have Mike to worry about, I don't think I would've made it out at all. Yeah, well, you can rest easy now. I figure we'll have him out of there in a few hours or so. I'm pretty sure of the location of the crevice he fell into, but, we're just gonna go ahead and need that map just in case. Amy? Somethin' wrong? How'd you know about the map, Billy? Goddamn it, Amy. I really like you. No one's ever been nice to me. Not like you. Why didn't you and your friends listen to me? Why? Why? Why? Why, goddamn it? Why? How did you know about the map, Billy? I warned y'all not to go out there. Take a look at her, boy. Take a real good look. Because that little cunt was this close... This fucking close to having you put away for a long, long time. Now don't pull that shit with me. You want to spend the rest of your miserable life behind bars? No. I didn't think so. You just thank your lucky stars she came to me first. Now, what did I tell you about killing large groups of people? Don't get sloppy. Don't get sloppy. That's right. And you know the rule: If you kill one, you gotta kill 'em all. Otherwise you leave witnesses, and you know what that means. Trouble. Hell, I'm sorry to have to get angry with you like this, Tobey, but it's 'cause I care about you. And you're my brother, and it's my duty... to discipline you for all the mistakes that you make. And you have to understand there are consequences for everything we do in life. Now, think of it this way. I depend on you as much as you depend on me. Now, what's gonna happen to me if you spend the rest of your life behind bars? Now, that may sound selfish, but if you can keep that in your mind, then you keep your ass out of jail. Now where's that map? Don't pull that shit with me, bitch. I didn't fall off no turnip truck yesterday. I want the map... The one youmarked the grave site on... The one that Tobey here saw you mark. No, never. Well, we'll see. Search her! Jesus Christ, Tobey! You fuck up like this again, I'll turn you in myself, blood or no blood. Now go on. Bring me back that map! Now, you know where you're going, right? Make sure the boy knows we have her. And if he gives you any shit, just soak him down with that. He'll tell you exactly where that map is. In fact, he'll even give you his whole life story, for that matter. No. She stays here with me. We're gonna have ourselves a little fun while you're away. I'd rather be dead. I'm gonna fuck you either way. Makes no difference to me. Now go on, Tobey. Bring me back that map. So? Aren't you gonna ask me? Ask you what? What kind of sick, horrible shit is next? Come on, Amy. Don't you wanna know? I mean, I'll bet it's burnin' a hole in your brain right now, ain't it? I don't care. Is Billy a killer? Am I a fuckin' killer? Don't you wanna know that? Yes, I am! I am a fuckin' killer, and so is Tobey too. He kills for me whenever I want without question, okay? Why? You ever hear of the Bradford mine disaster of '67? - Yeah. - Yeah. Of course you did. You're a smart college kid now. But I'll bet you didn't know that mine was being used as a toxic waste dump now. And when that mine blew, all the waste spilled into our drinkin' water. Some died. Some survived. The survivors got the cancer mostly. Women givin' birth to deformed babies. Mama was a survivor. That shed out back... the one that you first saw Tobey... Well, that's where Mama chained us up when her and Pa were mindin' the station. She'd say, "It's just to keep you safe." I just think she was plain ashamed and hid us in that shed... so as to not to scarin' the customers away. Anyway, that shed made for a very... creepy nursery. The people we kill deserve to die... Every single one of 'em. Like me, Billy? What do I deserve? Daddy used to say, "Don't ever let them take this land from you, boy, now, "because the real world will eat you up and shit you out, and you'll never survive." And it's self-preservation, Amy. That's the reason we kill. It's easy to judge people when you know nothin' about 'em. You don't hear what we hear. You don't see what we see... or feel what we feel. So don't judge us. Please. Please, I can't take it anymore. Fine. I'm done... with the talkin' anyway. No. I knew there was somethin' I liked about you, girl. You got fight in you, girl. I like that. Fuck! Mike! Mike? Amy, help! He was just standing there waiting. What'd he do to you? I don't know. I can't remember anything after that. Carrie, what if... what if he touched me? Shh. You just need to get some rest. I don't wanna rest. I can't... I can't rest. I can't... I can't sleep. My friends are dead. My friends were here, and now they're gone, and they're not gonna come back. It's not gonna be okay after this. I felt the same way once, after losing Richard. Is that him in the photo? Yeah. His dream was to drive across America... The back roads, of course. He bought a fully restored '74 Beetle just for the trip. He begged me to go along, but I was too busy. I don't know what the fuck was so important, but... Well, I mean, I took that picture the day he left. He was never seen again. What if I told him not to go, you know? What if I'd gone? What if I'd asked him to wait, or told him not to go, or what if, what if, what if? I don't know. I beat myself up for so many years asking those questions. But now I'm here with you... on this same stretch of road that Richard disappeared on. Listen, you're gonna be fine, okay? With time, you'll feel much better, I promise. I'm gonna hold you to that. I know you will. Can I help you, ma'am? Um, phone? - Thanks. - Will you be needing any gas? Yeah, sure. Fill her up. 911 emergency. Hi. I need to speak to the police, please. Hold the line, please. Bradford Police. Officer Craig speaking. Hello, Officer Craig. Um, my name is Carrie Mitchell. I need to report an incident that happened earlier. All right, ma'am. Go ahead. I was driving north on 87, and a girl ran out in front of my car. Was the girl hit? God, no. Thank God, no. Almost. But, um, see, that's not why I'm calling. What is the trouble, ma'am? Um, I believe her life is in danger. What kind of danger? Well, she said that, um, someone is chasing her. She says that she's being followed by a madman, and that he's killed four of her friends and many others. - Where's the girl now? Is she safe? - Yeah. She's in my car. And we're at, some gas station, God knows where. What's the girl's name? Amy Singer. She's a student at Boston University. Did you say Amy Singer, ma'am? Yeah, Amy Singer. And what'd you say your name was again? Mitchell. Carrie Mitchell. Tell me somethin', Ms. Mitchell. How do you get off on making these types of calls? Excuse me? Do you think you're being funny? 'Cause I don't. I don't find this amusing at all. This line is reserved for emergencies only. But I... I am calling about an emergency. Are you? Excuse me. Am... Am I missing something here? Amy Singer's dead. That girl's been dead for five years. Let her rest. Did you hear me, lady? Hang up the phone. Impossible. Pardon me, ma'am? Where'd she go? Where'd who go? The girl that I was with. She had blood spatters on her face and... Will you be paying cash or credit card? - Cash, I guess. - Thirty, even. You might wanna try the washroom around the back. Okay. Thanks. I'm not crazy. Help! Help! Please, let me in! Help, please! Let me in! Let me in! Go away, lady. - I don't want any trouble. - God. Please. He's gonna kill me! He's gonna... Please! I said go away. God. Don't scream. It's me, Jimmy, from the station down the road. Calm down. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm here to help. Just tell me what she said. Tell me so Amy Singer can rest in peace. I'm gonna let you go now, okay? Promise you won't scream? Damn. Your leg's broke. Tell me something I don't know, like what the fuck is going on here. It's November 19, the anniversary of Amy Singer's death. - What? - She appears every year on this day. I spent two hours of my life listening to her story, and you and the cops are telling me she's a fucking ghost? Amy Singer doesn't know she's dead. Her ghost continues to lure people here, and Tobey continues to kill 'em. We have to figure out what's keeping the spirit around... or others will die. How do you know this for sure? Brought you here, didn't she? There's that old sign in the field out back... This used to be a Gas Hog. It's where it all began. The old buildings was dismantled four years ago... after Go Go Gas took over. - Why? - There's a map. What map? It's marked with the location of the other victims. My husband's car... I found it out back. Where's the map? Did she tell you? Amy's spirit won't rest until that map is found... and delivered to the proper authorities. You have to tell me. Well, how did you know that she would come to me? I mean, anyone who was driving on that highway could've picked her up. - I had a feelin'. - A feeling? See, we was all born with defects. My older brother Billy was born with no arms. My twin brother, Tobey, well, he was blessed with a face only a mother could love... and a temper the devil would fear. What's your problem? I was born with the ability to see things. What'd you see? Let's just say the killin' needs to stop. Now tell me, where's the map? Someone there? Is that you, Tobey? Just doin' what should've been done years ago, boy. The killin' needs to stop. I didn't want it to end this way, Tobey. But the killin' stops now. No, Jimmy. No. My God, Jimmy. What happened? I heard a gunshot. Jimmy? Jimmy! Jimmy. My God. What happened? Jimmy. Jimmy? I don't think Uncle Jimmy can help you now. What? You stupid son of a bitch. You shot him, didn't you? Had to. He was about to kill Uncle Tobey. What was he doing back there anyway, rummaging through all that junk? We won't know anymore now. Where's your manners? It's not polite to stare. No!
