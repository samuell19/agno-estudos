Hollywood Party (1934) Re-synchronization: Walter Santos -Ah, how's business? -Swell. It's Garbo. It'll be even better next week when you play my new Schnarzan picture. Ah, what a star! What a star! Oh, has the trailer gone on yet? You'll just about catch it. Good. Coming to this theatre soon The mighty monarch of the mudlands... SCHNARZAN THE CONQUEROR! Jungle beasts knew his call... The hidden terrors of the jungle held no fear for... SCHNARZAN THE CONQUEROR! How exhilaratin'! Untamed, untouched, untrammeled by civilization. Nature's forgotten man who couldn't forget the call of nature. Can't you see jungle woman? I'm human even if I've got a touch of the King Kong. Human? You make me laugh. Giving them the royal razz. OK, but underneath this lion's skin beats a heart seething with sentiment. Oh, I bet you say that to every animal. Go on. No. I don't. Listen to me, jungle woman. Don't miss it if you can. SCHNARZAN THE CONQUEROR! SCHNARZAN THE DANGEROUS Coming to this theatre soon Well, there's one thing certain. I'm not coming to this theater next week to see that cluck Scharzan. You can't call my star a cluck. Cluck, cluck. There ought to be a law. You shouldn't allow your patrons to say things like that. Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Knapp, Schnarzan is slipping. The public's fed up with those mangy, toothless, moth-eaten lions that he's been fighting with. You're right. You're right. You'll flop with Scharzan. But the week after you'll mop up with my star. The one and only Liondora. Liondora... That cheap imitation of the great Schnarzan. What are you talking about? Schnarzan is a has-been. Stop arguing, Mr. Goldfarb. Liondora is a bust too. He doesn't even use real lions. I know because one of my relatives played the hind legs. But if I were you, boys, I'd go and buy some real, honest to goodness, man-eaters. Killers! Give the public a thrill. That's the only way you'll ever make any money. Real man-eaters... Killers... That's an idea. The little dream nest in... THE HOLLOWS BUMS KEEP OUT What a game! What a game! I trust you scored, sir. You're darn trustin' I scored. I hit four goals and three players. Fetch me my slippers! Hiya, Knapp. What a day! Jimmy, this is getting serious. Your public is turning away from you. They say your lions are moth-eaten, toothless and half of them have the mange. The mange, hah? Well, they didn't get it from me. But look. Something's gotta be done on it. Look at that. Right on the front page. What does it say? Baron Munchausen arrives in Hollywood tomorrow, with a cargo of wild jungle beasts. Jimmy, this Baron has the greatest bunch of lions in captivity. Well, why not get in touch with him and use his lions? That's what I'm leading up to. Buddy Goldfarb may have the same idea about Liondora. Liondora... My hated rival. Why not beat Goldfarb and Liondora to it? We've got to get those lions before they do. Now... When the Baron arrives... entertain him the same way you did Bernard Shaw and Professor Einstein. You mean make the crumb my house-guest? Exactly! And don't forget, The Baron arrives tomorrow. Then we'll have to work fast. I'll get a flock of beautiful girls and give him a real African welcome. Then we'll throw the biggest affair since the "Boston Tea Party". Jimmy, you're a genius! You took the words right out'a my mouth. The great Schnarzan invites you to a Hollywood party in honor of celebrating Baron Munchausen and his lions. Don't be silly. Gotta date. Gotta go to Scharzan's party. Have to let the bridge game wait. Gotta go to Scharzan's party. It's going to be a swell affair. You'll be the belle of it. Baron's lions will be there. The rest is really irrelevant. Tonight's the night. Tomorrow... What a headache. That's the hell of it. -Gotta go to Scharzan's. -Gotta go to Scharzan's. Oh, is that you my little white dovey-dovey? How are ya? Now listen to me you dirty, big, black, snake in the bush. What's the idea of giving a party and not inviting me? Heh? -Answer me that! -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You don't have to get sore just because I kicked you out of my last picture! You don't belong to these parties! You get too rough! Too involved! That's remindin' her. Now let me tell you somethin'. The day I don't play in your pictures any more Schnarzan will be terrible. What do you think of that? You know what I think of you? You know what you are? Un stupido animale brutto... What's that? You can't talk to me like that! And that ends another chapter in my love life. Hello. Here's Joan Crawford, Mr. Durante. Not so loud, please. No answer. Oh, that Hollywood party... Yes, Mr. Durante. Here's Miss Jessup. -Hello. I can't hear you. -Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello!

Hollywood party Nobody sleeps tonight Oh, auntie, I hear it's going to be a wonderful party. I'm awfully glad we came to Hollywood. Think of it, Harvey. If you hadn't known Scharzan when he was poor, we wouldn't have been invited. I knew him when he didn't have a kettle to cook in. Oh, I beg your pardon. You're right. He does look a little nutty. Lobby! Oh, I want to thank you for a very nice trip. Oh... Thank you very much. Not at all. I'd love to pick up things for you. Why didn't you take off your hat? Oh, I was afraid I couldn't get it back on with that same air of abandon. Well, where did you go? Auntie, I... I lost my purse. This is Mr... Harvey, we can't afford to mix with strangers. If we only went with our friends we'd be pretty lonesome. Come, Harvey. Come, Linda. Schnarzan will be furious. It's gonna be a great party. Come on. You know why Scharzan is giving this party? No. To get those lions from the Baron. If he gets them, Liondora, you're through in pictures. Then I've got to get in that party. Beat Schnarzan to the punch. What are we gonna use for money? -I want a taxi. -A yellow, sir? Haven't you any colors beside yellow? How about a green or a blue? Oh, I just love blue. She looks much better in blue. I wonder who they are. Oklahoma oil doing Hollywood. Slug-nutty about royalty, movie stars, titles and that sort of thing. Pardon me, but do you know where the great Schnarzan lives? Yes, sir. I'm sorry, old man, but I didn't get your name. Jake. My name is Harvey Clemp. I'm the millionaire oil king from Clemp City, Oklahoma. This is my wife, Henrietta, the Oil Queen. Henrietta, this is Jake. How do you do. That gives me an idea. Don't worry, Mr. Goldfarb. I'll crash Schnarzan's party, all right. My husband is the multi-est millionaire in Oklahoma. Show the man, Harvey. A thousand dollar bill. You can't do that unless you're a millionarie. They'll recognize you at the party. Everybody knows Liondora. Ah, but I will not be Liondora. I will be the Grand Royal Duke Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus Forfoltu-Varenikos from southern part Europe. Good old Peloponniesus. And now I'll ask one of Schnarzan's guests to say a few words. Ladies and gentlemen... Robert Young. Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. Is this a party? You should see them pouring in with that goofy look in their big blue eyes. Gorgeous girls... Brunettes who once were blondes. Blondes who were once brunettes. Hello. And here comes a little platinum. Hello, Pansy. That was a girl, not a man. Hello, Joan. Oh, is she a dream and you should see that dream walking. I'm sorry. I don't know where it is. And, now ladies and gentlemen, as I was telling... Said, I don't know where it is. Lad... Oh, butler... Would you show this gentlemen the swimming pool? -He wants to dive in. -Yes, sir. -And be sure it's empty. -Yes, sir. And now here's to beauty, laughter, romance, music. On with the biggest party ever given in Hollywood. Feelin' high I get home Well, what's the use Of feelin' low Now there's a reason If you want to know why I'm in love And feelin' high There's a reason If you want to know why I'm in love And feelin' high Feelin' high What's the use Of feelin' low Off that wagon On the town Gonna be up Never down There's a reason If you want to know why I'm in love And feelin' high My friends, I welcome you to my humble domicile. Tonight, let us throw all transgression to the winds and enjoy ourselves with absolute infernity. This may be madness to you, Harvey Clemp, but it's baloney to me. Henrietta, you astound me. The place is littered with movie stars and that makes some litter. Very artistic. Oh, it's wonderful. What did you expect, auntie? Nobility running around. A duke. An earl. A marquis. I want to hobnob with mi'luds. I want to rub shoulders with royalty. I want a title. How about "Came the Dawn"? Madame... Oh, this is too too divine. How too too distingue... How too too risque. Sorry, but I didn't catch the name. I am the Grand Royal Duke Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus Forfoltu-Varenikos. Beg pardon, but I still didn't get the name. Oh, is very easy. Is most simplicity. I am the Grand Royal Duke Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus Forfoltu-Varenikos. Oh, well... Let it go. A Grand Royal Duke? This is the happiest moment of my life. This is my niece, Linda. This pleasure is met with for to suffer with happiness. This is my millionaire husband, Harvey Clemp. -Pleased to meet your... -Grace. Grace? A big strapping fella like that? You care to honor me with this dance? Oh, no honor at all. Harvey, don't forget to invite the Duke to the hotel for cocktails. By all means. Oh, is be great pleasure to go to hotel for cocktails and dinner. Did I say dinner? May I have this dance? Well, you'll have to ask my uncle. May I have this dance? Well, I'm a bad one to lead, but I can follow. I guess I'll just drink this one out. -It's the Baron. -It's the Baron. That's what I just said. Look at them wagons. That must be the lions. They all can't be the Baron. Remember! I want to give him a royal welcome. The Baron is to get the Champagne Suite. You take charge of the left wing. You take the right wing. I'll take the dark meat. This is a holiday No melancholy day This is a jolly way To welcome the Baron Who came from the Congo today Wait a minute! Wait a minute! -The Baron's coming to say hello. -Hello! Yes, hello! Hello!

And so we're here. It has been a long walk but we here. Schnarzan, I bring you the most ferocious ape ever captured in the middle of Africa. He is the son of King Kong. His name is Ping Pong. And look... Let papa down. Pingy, go to Schnarzan. A chimpanzee! Is that etiquette? I'm going to say... I'm going to... It's an honor to our nation To hear your salutation We have our celebration In great anticipation I want to say... I want to say... No lions made him shiver No tigers made him quiver Down by the Niger river. Where lions eat your liver I want to say... I want to say... It really is a sensation A most magnificent ovation There's been nothing like it before But I really expected much more Please... I only want to say... He only wants to say... Then let me say it! I only want to say... Hello! I fooled you! Oh, hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! We are very glad to meet you And we greet you with hello Hello! Hello! Hello! Greetings and salutations, Baron. Welcome to my poor house. Well... Who wants to live in a poorhouse? Hello, forever Hello, forever Hello! Hello! Hello! I never knew you cared. Hello! Look! Imagine coming to a party with wild animals. Oh, it's thrilling. It's like being at the zoo. -Knapp! -Jimmy! Everything is going to be OK. I gave the Baron the Royal Suite. That's the idea. Treat him right, you get the lions and your future's insured. Now that's what I mean. Imagine the kick your public will get when they see you fighting a lion like that. Teeth that can bite. Claws that can rip. What a kick when they see you with your head right in his very jaws. He might break my neck. There's the thrill of it. I'm willing to take any risk to make a big picture. You'll be the season's sensation. Every newspaper will print your name. Yeah, in the obituary column. Let's stroll. Fixing a cocktail? You picked a nice night for it. Careful. You'll scratch your face. Rather an informal entrance, isn't it? That Schnarzan... He thinks he can keep me away from his party, eh? That dirty such and such and so and so and this and that... Those are strong words, stranger. Wait til I get a hold of him. I show him how strong I am. I get a hold of his throat like this. I'd hate to be in his shoes. Hey! I kinda like you. Come here. Oh, is beautiful... Is wonderful. What a night! What a night! Oh, the moon is so musk mellow in the fragrance of your head. Oh, your Grace... I guess I was just made for love. Oh, you sweet honey bunch donuts... You can't be for to hide your feelings when soul is respond to soul. You have heart. You have fire. You make me for to burn. Oh, Grace... Don't call me Grace. To you I am just plain Nikolaus. Nikolaus... From souther part Europe. Good old Peloponneisus. Peloponneisus? What a beautiful name. How lovely... How romantic... Oh, Henrietta! You mustn't, Grace. You mustn't. No. No. You mustn't call me Grace. Call me... Call me Nikolaus. No... I like Peloponneisus better. Oh, let me for to grab your lipsky. No. No. Oh, no. I... I mustn't. You could just call me HC. Well, don't you know any other games but the oil game? Yes, but I like the old oil game best. Mr. Clemp, come with me. I want to show you something. Yes, my boy. What is it? It's your wife. Well, I've seen my wife. In fact, I married her. But, Mr. Clemp, this is important. Hey, HC... You're not going to leave me here all alone? Don't go away. I'll be right back. Read a book or something. You gorgeous crab, you. Always filled the cup of happiness for all the people for to drink that. Yes, that's me. I can dish it out, but I can't take it. Oh, Grace. Grace! That's what I wanted to show you. Hey, this is going to be good. He bit her. We're in a very good position. I can see everything. -He kissed her. -No! She responds fairly well. Interesting technique. Oh, your Grace. -But that's your wife. -Oh, yes! That's Henrietta. Always improving her mind. Never before I'm feel such terrifical vibrations as I am feel now. So top tip, my delirious ducky wucky. I wonder how I'd do with those tactics. Oh, Grace. Oh, so you're back, eh? Oh what a night... The moon is so mellow and the fragrance of your hair... Let me give you what is commonly known as "the works". What's the matter with you? Are you going crazy? I don't seem to have the right purchase. Still like the old oil game best. What's your name? You know, there's something about you I like. Sure it isn't yourself? Oh... You got me. Oh, I think you'll recover. If you'll nurse me back to life. Plenty of fresh air and sunshine. And moonshine. When the moon begins to rise My heart begins to beat Flowery lanes and starry skies Have made me indiscreet Love affairs that come and go Have thrilled me in the past But though you're not my first love I'm sure that you're the last I've had my moments I will confess My fleeting moments Of tenderness I sang of true love I played guitars Then found a new love 'neath tropical stars This time's the last time This time it's new Love as a pastime For me is through I've had my moments My big bad moments But now my one big moment is you You've had your moments I've had some too In moonlit gardens On waters blue I was a siren At seventeen A ball of fire You know what I mean? But now I've found you I know that's true I'll search around you I'll stick like glue I've had my moments My big bad moments But now my one big moment is you But now my one big moment is... -Me? -You! I've had my moments My fleeting moments -I sang of true love -I played guitars Then found a new love This time's the last time -I've had my moments -My big bad moments But now my one big moment is you -I've had my moments -I've had my moments I've had my moments I will confess My fleeting moments Of tenderness I sang of true love I played guitars Then found a new love 'neath tropical stars This time's the last time This time it's new Love as a pastime For me is through I've had my moments My big bad moments But now my one big moment is you -You. -You. -He'll sign it without... -Hiya, fellas. -Oh, hi. -What kept you? I had to work overtime. How ya doing? -Swell! -Oh, great! -Got the autographs yet? -Yeah, I got a book full. -And you? -If I get another one, I'll have two. Well, don't worry about it. We'll have plenty before the night's over. Oh, this is going to be a big night. Well, I've got a big book. -Any celebrities show up? -Sure. -What are you? Autograph hounds? -Yeah! -Did you get any? -Yep, I got some. Let me see. I got a whole book full. Look at this. Will you look at this. Look at that. Look at that. -The stars write fast, don't they? -Yeah! -You collectin' autographs? -No... Collecting photographs. No, not of you crumbs. -Hey, there's somebody. -Come on. No, no, no, Professor. Your dissertation refutes every scientific theory. But, Doctor, please reflect on the profound aspects of the matter and consider the vital points of my thesis. But, gentlemen. Your theories are distinctly contradictory. Are you guys actors or hillbillies? Come out from under the spinach, Gable. We know you. Out of the way, moron. We are of the scientific world not thespists. Look, look. This proves my point. A perfect specimen of the Neanderthal Man. What? That? Oh no. Look at the measurements. Look at that. Look at that. That's the androgynous type. I can prove it. The androgynous cranium is always hollow. Now listen. No, no no, Professor, you're wrong. That is the skull of the Anthropedia. No, that's more like the Anthropedia. Now, listen. Ah, the obvious Neanderthal type. Now... Now, just note the difference. Neanderthal! Anthropedia! Androgynous! Well, there you are! Hey, fellas! Hey, fellas! See any prominent people? There's a lot of prominent people here. Yeah, Neanderthal! Who? Androphobia! What? Androgynous! What, are you kidding? Hold it! Okay! I'll skip this joint. Mr. Durante is in conference. He's not to be disturbed. Well, listen here. I want to see that pelican face. See? And, I'm gonna disturb him. The scientific gentlemen are with him. They're having their usual Wednesday night discussion. Get out of my way, you big telegraph pole. I've very sorry but the door is locked. Is that so? Well, you keep it locked, see, until I get a few more drinks under my belt and when I come back Schnarzan's goose will be cooked. What about Mendelism? But from the Neanderthal man to the Cardiff Giant it has been an absolute theory. -You are speaking pragmatically? -Peripatetically. In spite of all that, you still insist that Huxley's theory is authentic? Most emphatically, I do. I differ! Doing some research work for the Smithsonian Institute, I was called in consultation by Professor Eberworth. That emminent philuntrist who had heard what I did for Einstein and his relatives. Professor Eberworth says... Jimmy, I need you. I want to consult with you about a subject which has baffled all the scientists of the world. Namely, reincarnation. Not the carnation that I am wearing to my buttonhole. No... Not the carnation of a king, but reincarnation. A ponderous question. Professor Eberworth and me being the only two guys who knows the low-down. What is reincarnation you mugs, you earthworms, you nincompoops, you chuckleheads? Last night with my head on my lacy pillow I was a man dreaming I was a butterfly. Sipping the sap from flower to flower just like a little butterfly. I had butterfly words. Butterfly desires. Just a man dreaming I was a butterfly. And how do I know now that I'm not a butterfly dreaming that I'm a man? Wait a minute! I can see myself now. I go way back to Adam. Adam and his madam. Boys, I was Adam! GARDEN OF EDEN One, two, three, four, five. There's a rib missing. They promised me a woman for that rib. There's something screwy around here. Where's that beautiful baby doll? Oh, daddy... A carbon copy! I've been ribbed! Reincarnation works in wonderous ways. Like in the American Revolutionary days in 1775. Hardly a man is now alive. Not even you, old buzzards. I was! I was... Paul Revere! Paul Revere! Good old horse. How many more miles have you got in your system? I gotta million of them. Put that underneath your hatta A man has more lives than a catta Those episodes in my career are just A demonstration of three little words Re -Ink -Carnation Mr. Clemp, if you make for to get those lions is being terrifical pleasure for to let you produce pictures with me. Come, come, Peloponnesius. You don't mean that you'll let me invest some of my money in your screen offerings? I do better is that. I let you invest for all money. Sounds like a good opportunity. There is the Baron now. Make him an offer. Well, Baron... I'm prepared to offer you 50.000 dollars for your lions. -Will you take it? -I take 50.000 for anything. Beg your pardon, but we haven't met. I'm Harvey Clemp, the oil king. Look... A thousand dollar bill. You can't do that unless you're a multi-millionarire. A millionaire! Somebody give him a slipper. Quick. Gracie, move over. Sit down, will you please. Some champagne in a glass. Now, Baron, don't forget our deal is on. Deliver the lions to the studio in the morning and get our check for fifty grand. I will. Thank you. I'll give sixty. -I'll make it seventy. -Eighty. -Ninety. -A hundred. -A hundred and ten. -A hundred and thirty. Wait! You skipped a hundred and twenty. -A hundred and twenty. -A hundred and ten. -A hundred. -Ninety. -Eighty. -Seventy. Wait, gentlemen. You're going backward. We were up to a hundred thirty thousand. So we were. I'll make it a hundred and forty. I'll make it a hundred and fifty and that's all we can afford. Could I hear a hundred sixty? A hundred fifty-five? Waiting. Could I, please, hear hundred fifty-five? I'd rather make it a hundred seventy-five. Sold! Sold to the gentleman on my right for one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars. I want to congratulate you, Baron. I think you made a mighty good sale there. A mouse! There it is! Mousey, mousey, mousey. Nice mousey, mousey, mousey. -It's Mickey Mouse! -Oh, Mickey Mouse! Hey, you! Let go of my tail! An impostor! Stealin' my stuff! How mortifyin'! How mortifyin'! He ain't get the feeling and a guest in my own domicile. Fightin' words... My mansion ain't big enough for the both of us. Okay, pal. You wouldn't throw me out, would you? I wouldn't, hah? Watch me! -Do something, Mickey! -Yeah! Hey, Mickey! Cut out the adagios and play something to the level of these mugs.

We're in trouble. Harvey Clemp bought those lions from the Baron. He outbid me. Liondora had a hand in this. The rat! We've got to get those lion back. Olhe! My big bad moments That's Clemp's wife. Poor Clemp. Here's where you come in. Get busy with Mrs. Clemp. Do your stuff. You mean Don Juan? You're better than Don Juan. I'm Don Two. I got my work cut out for me. I wonder who it is. Maybe the Barrymores. Perhaps it's Garbo. What do you want? We'd like to see the Baron. Baron Munchausen. What's your business? Well, you see, sir... It goes like this. He bought some lions from us. And paid us with a check. Yes and we've been all over town trying to cash it. Fifty thousand tiddly-winks? Yes, sir. The Baron told us that a tiddly-wink was worth a dollar and a half in his country. That is, you understand, at the present rate of exchange. You guys are screwy! Now, listen... If you guys ring that bell again, I'll break your arm off and stuff it down your throat. Who rang the bell? I did. -Are you going to stand for that? -I should say not! He can't bluff me. I'm going to see the Baron if I have to stay here all night. I'll give him his check and take back our lions. That's a good idea. We can get along without his old piddly-winks. Certainly. We don't want... Not piddly-winks... Tiddly-winks. Piddly-winks... Now, if you come ba... Oh, Baron! Baron Munchausen! Don't be rude. Oh, Baron! Oh, Baron! Pardon us, folks. I've had my moments I've had my moments I will confess My fleeting moments Of tenderness I sang of true love I played guitars Then found a new love 'neath tropical stars An infant prodigy. This time's the last time This time it's new Love as a pastime For me is through Your stomach notes are beautiful. I've had my moments My big bad moments Rubenstein's melody intact. But now my one big moment is you You've got me under your spell. Please continue but in a lighter vein. A new style of singing. What stirrin' words... What diction... For posterity. I've had my moments I'm convinced. My big bad moments You're the biggest thing since Canera. But now my one big moment is you I'm gonna take you under my wing. And develop you. Do you think my personality and figure will appeal to the public? You'll know them for a gool I tell you. You'll be a double feature. Won't Clemp City be amazed! Maybe I'll be America's Sweetheart. You'll be everybody's sweetheart. Your picture will be on every ash can. My dream producer... Ah... Pardon me. Have you seen Baron Munchausen? Oh yes. Many times. I want some service. Mr. Durante says, Miss Velez, that if you came to this party you weren't to have anything to drink. I don't care whatever he say! I want service! I know, but he said no more tonight. I don't care! You keep out of this. Oh, so you want to strike me? Sit down. I wanna talk to you. Alright, but make it snappy. There they are. How can I ever repay you? If I've got anything you want, just ask for it. -Anything? -Anything. Then get your husband to give me those lions. I've gotta get some lions to fight with. It's my career. I must find a lion to replace Anatole. Anatole? That's Anatole. I owe my success to him. He was the first lion I ever conquered with my bare fist. I beat him to a rug. Anatole came charging me from behind a tree. I gave the famous Schnarzan call, and then... And then, I leaped. I got him by the throat. It was me or the lion. I gave him the jungle jai-jitsi... And then Anatole was a dead cat. It was another Schnarzan triumph. Just another chapter in my memory book. I have no fear of man, woman or beast. Just the way of the Durantes. And after you conquered Anatole, what did you do? I gave him a chance to rest and then I pounced on him again. He got immune! I'm double crossed. Oh... You, big brute! I like it on top. I'll mangle you... from bone to bone. There's no room for both of us. Hollywood Party! Hollywood Party! Hollywood Party! Hollywood Party! Going a mile a minute Hollywood Party Nobody sleeps tonight Hollywood Party Get up! Get out! Get in there! Hollywood Party Nobody sleeps tonight But now my one big moment is... -Me? -You! Hollywood Party Hollywood Party Tarzan, The Untamed Jimmy! Jimmy, wake up! Oh... Who is it? Oh, it's you. What's the matter? You frightened me, honey. I was just dreamin'. You've been sleeping an hour. Come on. We'll be late for Lupe's party. -Come on, dear. -Jean... Tell me... Do I look like a horse's head? No, Jimmy. Not like a horse's head. Come on, toots. THE END
