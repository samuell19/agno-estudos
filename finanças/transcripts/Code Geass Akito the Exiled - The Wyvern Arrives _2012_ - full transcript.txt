August 10th, 2010 a. t. b. In a blitzkrieg attack by the Holy Empire of Britannia, the nation of Japan was conquered in a mere month and its very name was erased from the world. And so, these islands in the far east were renamed Area 11 and became an imperial province. Revolutionary Calendar, year 228. Floreal 18th. The EU Army's 132nd Regiment carried out the operation to retake St. Petersburg. However, their route was blocked by the Britannian Army, which had already caught wind of the plan, and they were surrounded in Narva, a city southwest of St. Petersburg. My team, Assault Unit wZERO, launched a strike operation against the enemy blockade in order to rescue the isolated regiment. The soldiers that comprised the unit were youths from what was once Japan. The survival rate of this operation was painfully close to zero. Politicians, hoping to avoid the public backlash that would result from the loss of the lives of EU soldiers in the war, are bolstering the army's ranks with former Japanese, who do not count as official citizens. I myself am complicit in this. Frame 4, signal lost. Remaining Alexanders, 11! Enemy Knightmare group has entered operation area! I can't keep their panic suppressed. Joe Wise, try using steroids. I'm injecting them, but it doesn't seem to be helping... Most of the pilots are close to burning out. But look at this. This boy seems to be the only one who's still doing fine. That's Akito... Enemy force has breached F line! Enemy frame lost! Signals of three friendlies lost at the same time! No doubt about it... The enemy is self-destructing! Don't let the enemy close in! Destroy them before they can get close! Another self-destruct! Four friendlies lost! Here come more! Frame 8, self-destruct confirmed! Two enemy Knightmares destroyed! Only two?! Don't back down! Make them advance! Get in there and latch onto the enemy! Commander Anou. It is now 40 minutes until the 132nd Regiment begins their withdrawal. I'm well aware of that, Staff Officer Malcal! What's going on here? Why are there more enemy frames than you estimated? Even in surprise attacks, if more than an hour's mission time elapses, it is inevitable that the theater of operations will be pinpointed. Spare me your excuses! Or is it that this plan was flawed all along? It was you who made last-minute alterations to the plan, Commander Anou. You don't approve of me adding self-destruct devices to the Alexanders? A plan that wastefully depletes one's own forces, tactically speaking, ...is cowardice. It's only Elevens that are dying. The Elevens don't need your naive humanism. Come, surely you've heard of this. These Elevens are the descendants of a race of people who have always loved to die in acts they called seppuku and kamikaze! What could possibly be wrong with making them take part in a suicide operation? Are you sure that's wise? What are you talking about? If our forces are wiped out and the Britannian intercept line holds, as they retreat from Narva, the 132nd Regiment will be-- If Operation Alpha fails, the blame will fall on us of the wZERO unit, since we were supposed to secure an escape route for them. Do you believe that General HQ in Paris and the politicians will meekly accept the public backlash that is sure to come if the plan fails? Statesmen never let themselves get sullied. I-I refuse to let myself be the fall guy for this... I still... I... I... This is your fault! Why should... Why should I have to take the blame for the plan that you put together?! Leila! This isn't happening... This isn't happening... You're going to-- You don't have what it takes. What? L-Let go! Let go of me! What's going on? Who discharged their weapon? Why, if it isn't Maj. Hammel of the Special Forces. That was certainly fast. Allow me to correct you on one detail. They aren't "Elevens," they're Japanese. Major Malcal. Is that jiujitsu? Most impressive. Damn it, Hammel! Maj. Hammel, get this crazy bitch off me! Would you mind explaining what happened here, Maj. Malcal? Emergency Appointment #305! Lt. Col. Claus! Right you are... Deputy Commander Claus acknowledges change of command... It's all yours, Commander Malcal. Change in plans! Disengage all Alexander self-destruct devices! Capt. Clement! Y-Yes, ma'am! Chloe! Hilda! Send emergency texts to all frames! Looks like our boss is feeling her oats. Good for her. Surrounded, huh? Disengage bomb? Lord Wilhelm, we've lost the signal from Third Platoon! The Ghost of Hannibal, eh? Is that it? A Knightmare? Die! Damn monster! Wilhelm Squad annihilated. Signal has been lost! Sir Farnese, please request reinforcements. I believe that our forces alone are no longer able to hold the line. Without knowing the full measure of the enemy, I cannot draw more of our forces into this area. Die! Die! What?! DIE! Damn you! I don't believe in ghosts! Removal of enemy Knightmare squads from combat zone complete. 132nd Regiment has begun evacuation. Remaining troop strength of attack unit? Currently verifying. One frame! Receiving pilot biometrics, as well! 2nd Lt. Hyuga... It's 2nd Lt. Akito Hyuga! Remaining forces, rendezvous with G1 in 13th area! Withdraw from combat area! Activate main engine! #2 combat speed! To think that knights of the Holy Order of Raphael could not hold our own against Europian militia soldiers... Sir Farnese. We must give proper burials to our brothers who fell in battle. We can finally go home! I swear, it took those reinforcements long enough to get here! I didn't mind. Just think of it as camping out. Yeah, you could say that. War's a piece of cake! What are you doing? You by yourself? Yes. Can you give us a lift? That Knightmare? I've never seen that model before. Just to be safe, show me your ID. You're a long way from home, that's for sure. A damn Eleven? I'll give you a lift, but only if you ride in back with the Knightmare. One survivor. My plan was a success, but at the cost of the lives of many Japanese youths. My father told me that it was the duty of a citizen to protect his homeland. But do the citizens of this republic-- Do I appear to be a cowardly commander, hiding safe in her castle to these people who have lost their homeland? Major Leila Malcal is hereby promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel. She is officially installed as the commander of Assault Unit wZERO. The 40 Man Defense Committee approved it yesterday. In recognition of the success of the Narva evacuation plan, I assume. Congratulations, Leila. Leila Malcal gratefully accepts her new duties. I expect great things from you. The wZERO unit was based on your proposal. It's only fitting that you should be its commander. What's the matter? You don't seem very happy about it. General Smilas, the intent of my Attack Plan 145A is to launch sneak attacks on the rear flanks of enemy positions using Knightmare forces. For that reason, this plan requires the commitment of a large number of troops. If it continues to be carried out using small forces as it was this time, the losses incurred by wZERO will be untenable. Please let me expand the unit using Europian Army regular forces. I understand your idealism, but sending regular forces isn't so simple, Leila. Public opinion is against the idea of Republic soldiers dying in this war. Analysis by the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that the survival rate of soldiers in Attack Plan 145A would be low. Are you saying that you're fine with people dying as long as they're Elevens, sir? Leila, only a fool tries to make sense of every little thing. But, sir! It takes more than sound arguments to win people over. In the Narva operation the other day, the number of Japanese soldiers who managed to come home alive was exactly one. You saved the lives of 15,000 Europian soldiers. I didn't-- However, you really ought to show some regret over the incident with Lt. Col. Anou during the operation. I do regret it. I should have removed him before the operation began. Typical... Anou has been reassigned to the Warsaw supply force. It would seem that HQ has finally realized where his aptitudes lie, too. There will be another meeting of the 40 Man Committee tomorrow. Another one, sir? Incompetent politicians and bureaucrats find comfort in meetings. It might do you some good to sit in on one as an observer. Yes, sir. That reminds me, Leila. Do you have any plans for later? I'm attending a party to celebrate the troops' return from the Narva operation. I'm sorry I kept you, Lt. Hyuga. There's no need to be apologetic. My current assignment is to be your guard. Fine, fine... Right you are. Is this your first time in Paris, Lieutenant? I came here once, long ago. That painting fetched a rather tidy sum. It's better to speculate in art these days, not gold. Nonsense, investing in national bonds in wartime is much more lucrative. True, Britannia doesn't appear to have any interest in expanding the war. It's best when both sides are simply glaring at each other like they are now. I suppose a war without fighting is much more profitable than peace. Perhaps I should have invested more... We have non-alcoholic fruit juice, sir. You bankers are terrible... That's fine. Look at her... Can you believe she's wearing a military uniform here? Ah, she's that Malcal girl. Oh, the young lady we've heard so much about. I see that no one comes over to speak to a woman who is reading Guibert's A General Essay on Tactics at a party. Why, Lt. Hyuga, you do have a sense of humor. This is my first time inside the Palais des Tuileries, but this definitely lives up to my image of a Bien Natio conglomerate party. Wasn't this to celebrate the success of the Narva operation? I have no idea what they're celebrating. We're the only two soldiers here. Leila! Leila Malcal! Ah, excuse me. Begging your pardon. Sorry. Our apologies. Why didn't you call to say that you would be coming, Leila? It's been a whole year since we last saw you. It's been too long, Daniel. Stefan. Leila, why in the world are you wearing that to a perfectly good party? Please stop this boorish nonsense. A military uniform is formal wear for me. I certainly see that your tone is the same as ever, Leila. As I live and breathe! If it isn't our enchanting little sister. loan... Brother. Ah, now I understand. This is the lieutenant Eleven? This is Lt. Hyuga, my bodyguard. Pleased to meet you. I'm another one of Leila's big brothers. loan Malcal, the third Malcal boy. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lieutenant. Oh, right. Perhaps I should get this out of the way. She also happens to be my fiancée. This young lady was adopted into the Malcal family. But she also happens to be the apple of our father's eye. So he went and decided that we should be married. loan! But the thing is, I have absolutely no interest in marrying the likes of you. Stop this nonsense, loan. Behave yourself! Oh, I know! I'll make you my mistress! You'll be my kept woman! That's what would suit you best, Leila! Oh, my apologies. Why, you little-- Did you know that all Elevens are masters of bladed weapons? If you like, I'll be happy to carve your face to ribbons right here and now. Let go! Please, let go of me! Here. Please use this. Shall we go, Commander Malcal? Lt. Hyuga? Hey! Wait! I had no idea that you were a swordplay specialist, Lieutenant. What do you mean? Back there, you said you were a master of bladed weapons. Ah, that. You Europians are all the same. You all think we're karate masters or master swordsmen. You fear us for no reason, or you mock us. Not me. Speaking of which, I heard that you are ranked in aikido, Commander. Who did you hear that from? Capt. Clement told me. Anna needs to do something about that gossip habit of hers. Is it true that you and the Captain were classmates? When we were children. After I was adopted into the Malcal family. Apparently, my birth parents were Britannian aristocrats. Britannian? They defected to Europia? Yes. I was born here in Europia. But my parents died 12 years ago, leaving me to fend for myself. The Malcals, a huge conglomerate, took me in as an orphan because they wanted a claim to noble lineage. Intending to eventually marry me off to loan, their youngest son. Which is how he's both your brother and your fiancé... I love you people. Always trying to see who has the best bloodline and fortune... Lt. Hyuga. But if you don't like it, Commander, I'd be happy to get rid of it for you... This world of yours. 85 of my crew are dead, and another 37 are in the hospital ICU. And 20 of your own have set out for Heaven. Get your facts straight. It was 18. This is the first time a war this scale has been fought in the Underground. Ryo Sayama. We've both paid a steep price. Let's put an end to this. With that in mind, I've prepared a gift for you and your buddies. Ryo! I'm done rewriting the pilot ID! That's a good boy, Yukiya. There was a deposit in my bank account just now. Was there, now? Well, since we've paid for it, I suppose this isn't a present from you anymore. Don't talk so big about paying with money you skimmed from net banks. You bunch of two-bit thieves. Why don't you do it, too, then? Assuming you can, that is. Watch your mouth, you piece of Eleven trash! Come on, now. Let's not get so hot under the collar, all right? Ryo Sayama, you and your crew need to show respect to your elders. Big talk, coming from a thug. Right, Yukiya? Let him have his fun. After all, old folks love to lecture kids, right? Ryo. We have to avenge Mariko, Shinji, and the rest. Take it easy, Ayano. 15, 14, 13... How about it, Ryo? Why don't you join our organization? I value your talents. Thanks, but I'll pass. The thought of being your flunky makes me puke. What did you say? 4, 3... Ryo! Wow, everybody's blown to pieces... Man, what a mess. It's gonna be a bitch to clean this up. Yukiya, we won't be able to use this ploy next time. I know. Humans sure are fragile. S-Somebody... I need a doctor... Call a doctor... Well, I'll be. Still alive, huh? Help me... Sure, I can help you. But what's it worth to you? Come on, I'm asking you how much your life is worth. Are you people with those terrorists? That group you Elevens have... The Black Knights. Nope. What we're after... ...is world peace. Yukiya, Ayano. Next time, it's the real deal. I know, I know. Things are about to get fun! Ever since the revolution 300 years ago, the United Republic of Europia has maintained its republic system. However, what the revolution might really have given rise to is the money-worship that has overrun this republic that is the end result of irresponsibility and self-interest. That's even true for those who claim to be this country's leaders. If this keeps up, the day we're conquered by Britannia might be near. By the descendants of the royals and nobles who were driven from this country and fled to the new world because of the revolution. That is why I think this way: "If only Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte, the hero of the revolution, "had become emperor of all Europe rather than dying at the guillotine..." But Napoleon tried to set himself up as dictator. The dictatorship of one talented man is more beneficial to humanity than the democracy of the ignorant masses. That's what your late father wished for, as well. That's why he was murdered. I was still very young when Father passed away, so I don't-- Oh, no, I'm not criticizing him. Your father and I were best friends, after all. The fact that we keep the Elevens who live in Europia locked away in internment camps like this out of fear of Britannia is also cowardice resulting from republicanism. Though I have little enough pity for the Elevens for not resisting... Look at all those scrappy Eleven grandpas and grannies out there! I wish I could show them to the Eleven we've got in the back! Target has entered area. Right on time. Looks like the extent of his security is as predicted, too. All right, let's get this game started! T-minus 5 minutes. Is the drive beacon coming in clearly? Yeah, I'm positive. This is the route the nav system is showing. The hatch is jammed, huh? All right, let's get to it! Deploy! Hurry! Gardmare #3, prepare to intercept! Stupid cannon fodder! A Knightmare! Terrorists? Probably. We should stay put for the time being. General, get out! Hurry! Hurry! Get clear, hurry! Lt. Colonel, no! It's too dangerous! Come back! Shall I see how sharp my blade is? Ayano has secured the target. Good. We're out of here! Okay! Ayano! Take the geezer and meet up with Yukiya! There was another? What a pain in the ass... That's about enough from you! Who the hell is this guy? He's trying to go toe-to-toe with a Knightmare? He's even crazier than we are... If you're that eager to die, I'll be happy to oblige! Damn! This is bad! Crap! Ryo! Lt. Hyuga! I want you to take them alive. Ryo! Pilot of that Glasgow! Your friend is my prisoner! Resistance is useless. Come out of there at once! Don't hurt Ayano! I'm coming out! Oopsie-daisy... Hey, what the hell? You're just a kid. I don't think you're all that far apart in age. Commander Malcal. Letting them live would only put us at risk. I'm glad you can see that! He's right. Let them go! Do it now! Don't try to stall to buy yourselves time! Let them go right now, or I detonate these charges. I dare you. Your friends will die, too. Do I look like I'd back down over a threat like that? Yes, you do. Yukiya, do it! We'll be killed if they capture us, so you might as well! What are your demands? You did all this to kidnap Gen. Smilas, so what demands were you going to issue? I wanted top-of-the-line Knightmares. Knightmares? Do you think you can get away after doing something like this? We'll keep running as long as we can. You can't kill us like dogs this time. Don't be naive. The army will do whatever it takes to kill you, even attacking from the air. Please, tell me. What were you and your people really after? We want a place to belong. To belong? I wish I was as dumb as you people. You make a rotten world like this, and you're perfectly content with it. But for us Elevens, we don't belong anywhere in this world of yours. If you want a place for Elevens, are you going to found a country or something? I never had any intention of speaking for all Elevens here. All we want is a place for ourselves. Just for us. If you want a place where you can belong, I'll give you one. Join my team. That's where you can belong. I see... If we don't... ...we get bombed, huh? We don't have any choice in the matter, do we? Duke Velaines has ordered the Order of Michael to relocate to St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg? The Order of Raphael was destroyed in a battle at Narva, west of St. Petersburg. The enemy was a Knightmare squad that appeared behind our lines. The EU forces that struck out beyond the western front and occupied Narva by all rights should have been completely surrounded. It's unlikely that reinforcements could have easily crossed the western lines. The enemy appeared without warning amidst the siege line. Without warning? That is what the survivors say. They appeared suddenly, as if out of thin air. Just like General Hannibal attacking the ancient Roman empire. Hannibal? Ah, I see your point. The "Ghost of Hannibal," indeed. But if there are any ghosts here, it is the Europian Union itself. The ghost of the revolution 300 years past! They're a bunch of fools who value nothing but their own interests. The noble-minded Euro Britannia must oust such statesmen and lead the country in their place. Our cause is just! Shin, the blood of Oriental warriors flows in your veins. You will soon be part of our legitimate aristocracy and its thousand-year history. Your words honor me, Sir Manfredi. If that is the case, I would like you to give me the Order of Michael. Shin, such a brazen joke from someone so stiff! In five more years, you will lead the Order of Michael as my successor. How I look forward to that day, Shin. You mean more to me than my own brother. Brother? That's right. Let's walk into the new world together. You're horrible. Shin? It's unfortunate, Sir Manfredi. You don't have what it takes to command the Order of Michael. What are you saying, Shin? It is I... who am better suited. Sir Manfredi... It is time to set out on your journey. Yes, so it is. I will go on ahead, Shin Hyuga Shaing. Goodbye, Manfredi. Akito? Good morning, Comm. Malcal. Good morning, Lt. Hyuga. What are you doing out here? Keeping a promise. A promise? It's a grave for those who died in the Narva operation. A grave... for those who... We made a pact before the mission. The survivors would build a grave here for those who didn't make it. I was the only survivor. I'm partially to blame that they didn't make it home alive. They set out on the mission with smiles on their faces. That's right. Because we died in battle, our families now have full rights as EU citizens. That's enough for us. More importantly, Akito, why do you fight? You don't have a family to protect. You don't have a country to protect. You're all alone. What do you live for? So that I can die. Lt. Hyuga? Did I say something wrong? You got quiet all of a sudden. No, it's not that. I was talking with them, that's all. With who? They're supposed to be dead, but I can still hear them. I can hear their voices. I died myself, once. Soko ni iru kimi wa The "you" standing there ima dake no kimi ja nai. is more than the "you" of right now.
