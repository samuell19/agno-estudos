A promise of luxury... elegance... and beauty. This is me and this is my life. Or so I thought... I was so wrong. I've been working here for thirteen years. At first, it was exciting. I was told that life in a cruise ship is steady... ifs like working in a hotel. But no one told me that it would be like Noah's Ark. But ifs fine because my ﬂexibility resulted in my promotion after a year. I just got the hang of it. Fm now used to the crazy shaky ship life... like a life and death performance. But just like what they say in an ad... with just some tweaking, who do you tat! for'? Meet my family. My everything. My all. After many years, I finally decided to come home. Ready to come back to my family life. We finally put up a home. Now, I can finally take care of my sweetie and my children. Look how happy they are. But in the months that We been here with them... do they still need me? Oh babe, with just one kiss... Oh no! It's mama. Don't mind mama. - Even if she looks ridiculous? - I'm head over heels with you... Prepare your ears. And your eyes. Sweetie, you're so beautiful. I know. Ma, give back the mic to Papa. That's his song! I forgot. Sorry. Go ahead, sweetie. It's my birthday... you can sing it to me again and again. - Really? - Yes, ma. - Yeah, sing it to me, sweetie. - Come on, ma. Come on. If you insist. I'm head over heels with you... In your love, I rest... Papa! - Ma'am! - Sweetie! Sweetie! What have you done, Ma'am?! Sweetie, I'm sorry! You were so sexy when you did that split. Can you do it again? Will you spread your legs for me, please... No. The kids hate me again because of that split. It was an accident. Regina knows the reason why I left her, right? You're still not over that issue? She's still cold towards me. She was so close to me before I left. Come here. Come and sit on my lap. Sweetie, you know that she was just nine years old when you left. To work in a cruise, right? So is it my fault again? If I didn't leave to work... do you think we'd be able to put up this home? Will Regina finish her studies? I'm sorry for failing as a father. I know that you're just supposed to work there for five years... but I became a heavy burden. Sweetie, that's not what I meant. We're a couple, right? Didn't we promise to support each other? And you're not a heavy burden. You're very light... come here. So light... as light as a feather. Come here and stop all that nonsense. Sweetie. - Sweetie. - Uhm? I love you, sweetie. Even though you almost killed me a while ago. I love you. Now, I will kill you with so much passion. Sweetie! What is past perfect tense again? That's the one with “had”. Example, “I had ignored my siblings... because I was busy doing the lesson plan of my boyfriend.” Regina loves like a gay benefactor. No. He's just busy. Hey, mama said that we should sleep already. Don't mind her. Regina, mama told me that you are disrespectful to her. I know that you have issues with her... but just like the past tense, you should leave it all behind. At the end of the day, she is still our mother. On paper, yes. But just on paper. You say those things... because you had your own lives already when she left. I was also just a kid back then. Stop making up stories. And do you just measure motherhood by mere physical presence? You weren't the ones she left behind. Sweetie... I had this weird dream. A bully was pulling out my tooth with pliers. Isn't it a bad omen? Anyway, why didn't you wake me up? Did you pee? Sweetie? Sweetie! Sweetie? Sweetie? Sweetie? It was a shock for us. We were just celebrating his birthday last night... singing karaoke songs. I wish I have told him how much I love him. Papa was just a simple man. He wants his kids to be complete and together. As we were growing up, he diligently nurtured us. He did not care about his condition. He remained by our side. He never left us. He chose to be with us until the end. And we will do the same for him until the end. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I need to pee. My bladdefs about to explode. - Hon, you start the car. - Okay. I'll be there in a while. Reg, don't you ever leave Mama alone, okay? She needs you now more than ever. Why is it all about her? When she left us-- Will you please stop that, Reg? Reg, if my work's not based in Cebu, I'd be left here with you. But you're the one who's here so I hope you understand. Why don't you, two, just live here? Reg, this is Cavite. Santino studies in Novaliches. Do you want us to wake up at 2 AM everyday to bring him to school? You're the one who should stay here, okay? - We'll go ahead. - I still need to drop your brother at the airport. Let's go. No, don't leave me. I can't bear living with her. Wait, why is this with you? Hey, this is mine already. I'm Daddy's favorite girl so this is staying with me. Wait! I'm the one who got the highest score, so this should be mine. Reg, admit it. Your voice sucks. WOW! - Admit it. - You're too serious. The truth is Regina and I just let you win it. - Excuse me! - He's right. You think you're pop star, shouting... -“Good evening, Araneta Coliseum!” - Really, Araneta Coliseum. If you want EDSA. Papa is really gone, right? Reg, if you and mama are having problems, just call me, okay? Just visit me often, okay? Of course. Come here, you two. Ma'am... Yes? Will I leave that wheelchair here for your use? Do I look like I need it? You give this to the Senate... because people there suddenly get sick when they get sued! Okay. I will just search for the Senate's address. You were very handsome back then, sweetie. That's why my undies fell off when I saw you. But you left me... what will I do now? You can do it, sweetie. I'll try my best. I just want to be a good mother again. I just want to make up for my mistakes. I promise that I will do whatever it takes to be close to Reg again. That's a good decision, sweetie. Push through with that! Just promise me that you will help me. Of course. - Of course. - What now? What now? Ma'am... Ma'am, I assure you someone else is using the remote control. It's impossible that the unit is moving by itself. Guys, come on! Let's go! Close the deal! Close the deal Ma'am, calm down. Is there somebody else with you right now?! No, I'm alone. [Raul Manlapat: I'll always be here beside you.] Fudge! Me? Do you want to get a D.A.? No cellphones allowed on the ﬂoor! Hello? Shit! I knew it was you! You shout at me as if I'm not your mother. Since you enjoy stalking me... I'll update you... about my status. Just came from the conference room. TL gave me a memo because I screamed in the middle of a call... thinking that my dad's ghost was talking to me! I'm sorry. I forgot that your papa's account is still logged in. Whatever! Wait... my God... what's this, Regina? How scandalous! Here, babe. Thank you. You're the best. You seem like you're in a bad mood. It's nothing. Just a rough day at work. I actually wanted to go home... but I remembered that it's tougher to stay at home. Have some more, babe. Babe, be patient with your mother. She might still be adjusting. She's been here for months. Spare me all the drama. Babe, it's okay. Just remember that you have to look out for each other now. She acts like as if she didn't lose a loved one. I hate her, I swear I hate her. I want to leave that freaking house. You say all those things, and yet you already know the solution. Let's leave for the UK already. Babe, I have all the documents. All we need is the placement fee, and we're ready to go. See, babe, you don't have to stay with your mother. There's a problem, babe. What? I don't have enough money to pay for it. Why'? You know I'm a big spender. I don't have much savings... and I helped pay for papa's funeral. Babe, if only I am earning more, I would take care of it. But you know how much I earn as a teacher, right? It's not enough. How much would it all cost? Seventy five thousand. - Seventy five thousand?! - We need it in a month. In a month?! So it's one hundred fifty thousand for the two of us. Huh?! Babe, we can start a new life once we're in the UK. Right? I could never forgive you for doing that. I get it. But will you please explain those photos you have on Facebook? Being a tease may run in our blood... but being a slut is not-- Does your papa know about this? Don't you ever include Papa in this... and don't you ever meddle with my life... while I'm busy grieving for papa, you do nothing but have fun! Regina! Regina! Don't you turn your back on me! The problem with you is that you don't listen! You only care about yourself! You really are stubborn! Talk to someone else, ma. Don't you for a second dare disrespect me, or else I'm going to slap your face so hard. And I swear I will make your mouth bleed... until your molars scatter like pebbles on the ﬂoor! Is this my karma for leaving them? They all drifted away from me. Especially my youngest child... I will not let Regina do what she wants. This pork will be a witness to that! Ma'am, if you keep on doing that, you will really push her away. And don't worry. Fm just here. I will not leave you. Aww, you're so sweet. Midang, my Midang, come here... Ma'am... don't mention it... You're so sweet. Ma' "u That's what you deserve! You've asked for several salary advances already! Shame on you! Ma'am, what I'm trying to say here... is that you just let Regina do what she wants. Why not give her the placement fee? She needs one hundred titty thousand pesos for that. Are you stupid? I'll lose my daughter it I do that. Besides, where will I get one hundred fifty thousand?! Are you stupid, too? Give her the placement fee... and she will be indebted to you. Oh, my God! You are so amazing from head to tooth! I know, right? I will do anything in my power to be close to Regina. And if I help her earn one hundred fifty thousand... she will love me so much. John Lloyd Cruise Donna Cruise Sheryl Cruise I don't want to work abroad anymore. - Excuse me. - Yes? Is this Cruise Calling another cruise ship? No. We are the sister company of John Lloyd Cruise. We are a BPO company. BPO? What's BPO? BPO stands for Business Process Outsourcing. We are a call center. - A call center! - Yes. - So, you're just based here? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. - I'll try my luck here. Thank you. - Okay, please fall in line. Next? Tell me about yourself. I'm Samantha. I'm half Filipina, half American. Hi, I'm Kim Kulisap. Half Filipina, half Telletubby. Hi, I'm Noy. Nm; Wong. Half Filipina, half science. More operations, please. Next? Wait, let me guess. You're half man, half woman? I beg your pardon? Of course not. I am a pure Filipino woman. Okay. Tell me about yourself. I am Teresa Damaso Manlapat... and it is my belief that I, Teresa Damaso Manlapat, of legal age... residing at Barangay May Bumayo, Cavite City... should become part of your prestigious company... which will benefit both parties concerned. So, where do you see yourself five years from now? You... tell me first. Where do you see yourself five years from now? Well, I see myself in the same position... stuck in the same old routine. You're wrong. You are very, very wrong. Let me see your hand. Come on. Five years from now... you'll be in another country, the U.S. maybe... with a beautiful wife and three chubby kids. Me? A husband? You will become a wife with three chubby, adopted children. She's good. And because of that, you are qualified for the next interview. Oh, my God! I'm not expecting this! Oh! Oh, my God! Thank you so much! Good luck to both of you! Congratulations! - Thank you so much! Congratulations! - Thank you! There are two major types of calls that BPOs handle... Either it is an inbound or an outbound call. For inbound, you will receive a call and provide customer service. Answer inquiries... troubleshoot problems and the likes. Hi! My name is Terry... and I am from Sports Fantasy Plus. I hope that you're doing good today. For outbound, you are the one who will call the customers... and offer them our products. You have to sell and reach your sales quota for the day. That's why it is really important that you have good marketing skills. May I speak with Mr. Luke Startington, please? He's not here. Are you the father? No. Are you the son? Are you kidding me? Oh, so you're the kid? Now say thirty three thousand three hundred thirty three. Go. Thirty three thousand three hundred thirty three. Just turn it on. Turn it on? You just have to turn it on. It really is turning me on. Now say ”cook”. You. Cook. Cook Cook Cook Cook Cook “Ah 'H Ah Cook Cook To verify your location. Is it Quebec? As in Q? Cucumber? U? As in not me but you? E as in India? B as in Venice? E as in idiot? And C as in cellphone? Cook Cook Cook Cook I think I'm about to give birth! Hey! Labor! Cook. Is it good, sir? Pardon me. It's been a long time since I last had sex because my husband died already. You like it? Are you enjoying it? It tickles! It tickles! It tickles! Miss? Miss! Miss, are you okay? Miss? Help! Miss, are you okay? Hi, Raul. Thank you for calling Sports Fantasy Plus. I hope that you're doing well in heaven. Look at me now. Trying to get a new job. But I'm not quite sure if I'll pass the training. Sweetie... please... pray to Papa God... that my trainer will give me a passing grade. Bye, I love you. I asked for TL Vince's permission already. Where are you going? Just around the corner. So where's it? Just a secret. Excuse me. Wait! Oh, my God! Who died? She's here to collect bets for the games during wakes. Those who want to gamble, give me your bets. Hey, will you stop that? Ma'am, we offer you our sympathies. How did you know that I'm grieving? You're not just call center agents, but fortune tellers as well! So a loved one of yours really died? Yes. Our condolence. - Condolence. - I'm sorry. Peace. What's happening? Hey! What the-- Who are you? Why are you scaring us? Why are you like that? TL Vince, you're just in time. Teresa Manlapat is a newly-hired agent. Didn't I request you to hire someone younger and more trainable? The team is already underperforming... and you're giving me an old woman who always go to the toilet! Our new wave of employees will arrive next month. For now, work with what you have. My bladder is still in good shape, sir. Take this post. Reg, what are you doing here? Ma? Shouldn't I be asking you that question? Is that your boss? What a bad attitude he has! Wait! She's your mother? Why don't you look like her'? I'm sure you look more like your father. You said your mom's dead already. Oh, Fm sorry. Guys, I'm logging out for now. What did he say? He's coming out? I mean, he's logging out? Ah! - He's off on a date. - Bye. Regina, wait for me! Regina! What? I thought you work for Convergence? I don't work there anymore. Why am I not aware of it? What's new? Just resign from this job now! I just want to help you out with your placement fee. I will give you my entire salary. I know that it won't be enough, but it will help somehow. If you don't want to accept it... you'll stay with me forever. Yehey! Fine. But I don't want you following me around. I'm not your pet. Huh? Stay away, okay? Okay, fine. Guys, check your stats. Check your stats. Are you ready for another round of insults? Nice! Can we watch horse races here? That's a Brag Board. That's where you see our team's ranking. So what's our rank? Second to the last, like a losing candidate in Ms. Universe. All of you, to the conference room after your shift. We didn't even make it to the semi-finals. Good morning, sir. This is David... calling from Sports Fantasy-- I don't know what to do with you, guys, anymore. I've never seen a more stupid batch of agents. It's very simple. Make a sale! Does it sound like rocket science to you? Raul... don't leave me, Raul... Raul... - Teresa! - Ah, Raul! Are you actually dreaming in the middle of the meeting? Sorry, sir. it's my first day. I'm still adjusting. Adjust?! You should use your brains to good use! Vince, I think ifs unfair... to put all the blame on us for the team's poor performance. Why'? Am I the one making the calls? It's you who do it, right? Excuse me. Let me clarify your role here. You're the Team Leader, meaning, you're part of the team's performance. Am I right to conclude that the performance of the team... also depends on your leadership? Besides, it that TL position was not stolen from me... things would have turned out differently. That's my girl! Shut up! I'm warning you. I will report you to the higher ups! You're here the entire day, and yet you just made a total of 3 sales. And those 3 clients were the ones who called you. You're a burden to the team. Anyway... our foreign client will give a bonus... to any team that will sell twice its sales quota. Twenty five thousand for each agent. I know that given your brilliant performances... this announcement isn't for you. But I just had to announce it because it's part of my job. You can go now. For that bonus, I can even sell my own mother. - Yeah! It's not a bad prize! - We can use the twenty five thousand each... for your placement fee. We can do this! Tissue, please. [Are we going home together?] - Can you please pass this? - Sure. Are we back in high school? Pass the message? This is for you, Reg. Rejected! Rejected! It's okay. Maybe she's just not in the mood. Hello, I'm on my way. Just give me fifteen minutes. Come on, sweetie. Let's watch TV together. I feel so sleepy during my graveyard shift. Now I'm wide awake. At the call center... I have lunch at 3 AM and then have my dinner at 12 NN. Crazy! Are you feeling sad? None'? Because you're fat? From the makers 01' the hit Super Abs is one revolutionary product... -on abs workout... - Sweetie, look! That's the product I sell! Insta Abs! Your instant abs workout! Midang! Midang! Midang! Yes, Ma'am? What's that? Get me a pen and paper! Hurry! Hurry UP- Hey! I thought it was an emergency! There! We'll jot that down, sweetie. Are you sad? Feling lonely? Still single, because you're lat? That's a good idea! Good morning. My gosh, did you drink something? Secret. Hey, Lolay, is this your desk now? TL Vince told me... to sit beside you so I can rub off some of my brilliance on you. Hey, are you sad? Feling lonely? Still single because you're lat? Go to hell! Shucks...it didn't work. Damn it! Hey, are you sad? Feling lonely? [Foreign language] Come again, sir? Uhm, I'll call you back. Check your stats now. The instatabs uses soothing electronic muscle stimulation. It functions as an electrode... at which electrons leave the cell and oxidation occurs. But wait, sir, there's more! Order now and we will slash-- Attention, dear customer... happy to sell! Guys, check your stats! Check your stats! All of you, to the training room now! Where's Lolay? Sir, she has dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorhea? She's menopausal, idiot! You think this is all a joke, huh? However dismal your performance was before... at least we're just second worst. Now, we've sunk to the bottom, and I guess... it's still my fault? - Perhaps your spiels no longer work? - Don't you dare interrupt me again... -when I'm speaking. - You know why your team performs this way? Because you're such a pessimist! You're such a leech, sucking up all the happiness in this world. - What the hell is your problem? - You are my problem! You always talk back, justify things, and yet you're incompetent! - I think that's hitting below the belt, sir. - That's exactly my problem! The daughter is as incompetent as the mother! Have you seen your records already? Besides the fact that you're the worst seller that this company has ever seen... you also have the most violations. According to QA, you've been saying nonsense during your calls... inventing all your stupid spiels. Why don't you just read spiels in your manual? I assume that you were know how to read, right? Of course, sir. When I was younger, Pluto was still a planet. Not everything you read is right. You're a hopeless case. I know that I'm old already. But does it mean that when you're old you're useless? Vince is just like that. You'll get used to it. That's why I admire you for enduring all these. You can contain your anger. Keep it UP»- because I'm not like you. You know, when your papa died... I coped by just laughing it off. If I faced the truth... the pain might kill me. It's a good thing that you're able to come with us. At least I'll be able to forget our monster TL. Besides, my baby girl is here too. Ma... You, two, are so sweet! But seriously, why can't you make any sale? Ma, if you're a newbie, it's better to just follow the manual. So that your TL won't have any reason to reprimand you... because you're just following the protocol. But let's face it. Their spiels suck! Right! They don't work at all! Besides, you can offer discounts as long as you ask TL's permission. Remember, customers buy when agents are persistent. So just go for it and push them until they swipe their credit cards. You all talk like you've reached your quota. But have you done that? No. See? I'm so confused! Ma'am, check out this bra. What's your size? Cup A, Cup B, or Cupcake? You don't have to ask. You can fit it here, Ma'am. We have a fitting room. - You allow fitting of a bra? - Of course, ma'am! Come! - You have a fitting room? - Yes, of course. There you go! I'll take care of everything! You, bastard! Everyone's going to see me naked in there! Ma'am, how about a blouse? Who are you with ma'am? I'm with my officemates and my daughter. You have a child already? With that sexy body?! I can't believe how a child came out of that body! I have three kids already. And my husband just died. My sympathies, ma'am. But you know what? Your husband is very unlucky... because he can no longer see how sexy you are if you're wearing this. H ere, méfam! Really? - Yes, ma'am. - You're sure that I'll look good in it? Close your eyes, please. Close my eyes? Yes. There. Think of the dress that when you wear it... your husband tells you that you're very beautiful. Have you thought of it? - Yes! It's a red dress! - Okay. When I wear it, my husband always tells me... that I'm more beautiful than Maria Mercedes. There... now, ma'am, open your eyes. I like it! It's pretty! How much is this? For you, ma'am, it's just one hundred pesos. A hundred? Maybe you're just using your sales talking skills. No, ma'am. Sales talk! Sales talk! That's what I need! Thank you! Thank you! You're heaven sent! Wrap this up! Go! Do you still remember when you were young? Whenever we went home from church, you would always sit on my lap. You want to sit on my lap now? Ma, we have so much space here. By the way, the vendor a while ago was very sweet. He doesn't take his eyes off me. Give him a prize! I'll tell this to papa. It's not like that. I think we should follow him. We must talk to our clients as if we're longtime friends. Make it personal. Go, ma. Push that idea. This is for you. I hope you like it. Thanks, ma. You're welcome. No one bothered to inform me that we have to wear costumes! HR regularly holds costume parties. We need to wear costumes every Friday. Sometimes, we even have a Decorate-Your-Dress Day... or Poster-making Contest so we don't get bored. Seriously? It's better than sitting all day in front of our computers. At least we become creative because of this. You're what? I've been single since birth! And ifs because Fm fat! No, Ms. Miranda. - I don't think that is the reason. - You don't understand! I'm sure you're some hot lady... who's having no trouble finding a man who'd go out with you. No, Ms. Miranda. In fact... I'm on the heavy side too. But first, it starts with you believing in yourself that you are beautiful. Do you believe in that? You are beautiful. No matter what they say. Ifs so hard to believe that... when there are all these ﬂabs jumping everywhere. Exactly! But you know what? I found a way to remove those excess ﬂabs. At first, I wouldn't want to believe it. But I'm trying it now and the results are unbelievable! I lost abdominal fat in a matter of weeks... when I started using Instabs. Alright then. Here's my credit card number. Thank you. Guys, Teresa made a sale. Let's give it up for her. Thank you. Where's Martin'? I don't want to judge him because he's not a book. He might not be a book but he sure can book dates. Of course. Congratulations, Ma! You made your first sale! Not just my first! I sold twenty units already! What? What? Really? This Lucy Liu lookalike is lull of baloney. I'm saying the truth. You can ask management. One hundred percent. All calls are sales. Seriously? How did you do it? Here is my secret... you must exchange stories with them. That would lengthen the call! QA will reprimand you! Correct. What's the point of a quick call if you don't sell anything? So you meant what you said before, Ma? Make it personal? Yes! I found out that those Americans are lonely people. They need someone to talk to. So I might as well put my big mouth to good use, right? If this doesn't work, I will use Lucy Liu's moves on you! Really? Yes! Complete with a threat! Let's go, Reg! Go out in the sun. You look pale. Are you sure you need to talk to my supervisor? Certainly, sir. Let me put you on hold. TL, it's a sup call. What is this again, Teresa? Hi sir, this is Vince, one of the supervisors from Sports Fantasy Plus. How may I help you? What happened? Escalation call. I have no idea what I did. Okay sir, I will. Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Commendation for Teresa Manlapat. You're really awesome! Thank you! - My child! Congratulations, Ma. I did great, didn't I? I told you we could do this. Cheers! Just like what TL Vince said, the daughter is as good as the mother. Whatever! You used to hate your mom. Now, you're admiring her. She's going to cry! She's going to cry! She's going to cry! She's going to cry! She's going to cry! Hey! Stop teasing my daughter! We have one more reason to celebrate! I'm excited to go to the beach! You're right! It's this weekend already! We don't have money for that yet. We took care of that. Regina borrowed money from me so you two could come. Fabulous! Fabulous, right? Sweet! Okay. Let's order more food. Not me. I'm on a diet. - Hi Teresa! It's me Vince. - Vince? Meet me tonight for dinner. I have something to tell you. I'll let you know where we'll meet. I knew it! That Vince is really fond of cougars! Don't tell me that he likes you? What? - Hey! Don't say that! - Cheers! Let's all, cheers. Cheers. What are you wearing, Ma? The dress I bought in Divisoria. This is the only decent clothing I have. I can't wear my cruise uniform. I am meeting my boss. Can't you borrow some clothes from Reg? If I wore her clothes, people would see my entire body. Teresa! - I need to go, son. Bye! - Okay. Bye. Sorry. Heavy traffic. - Let's go. - Okay. Teresa... is it really Teresa? Can I call you Terry instead? Terry? Surely. Good. I hope you don't find this awkward but I like you... Sir, my husband just died. In fact, his ashes are still in my home. I haven't moved on from his death yet. You really are funny. But it's not that. I just want to let you know that I'm really happy with your performance so far. Our client called me and among the agents... they were impressed with you the most. Thank you. Another reason why I'm here is because... I want to say sorry. I'm sorry for all those things that I've said. It's okay. No. Terry. It's not okay. I've been a jerk. I'm sorry because, I've been an a**hole. This is really a stressful job. I'm the one who gets blamed by the management. That's why I asked to meet with you... so I could give you a peace offering. Eat all you want! Really? Yeah! I can eat all of it? Everything you want. You're sure about that? - Waiter... - Yes, ma 'am. I want a bucket of beer, grilled pork, and 2 cups of rice. - He will pay for all of those. - Yes, ma'am. Right? Are you joining the trip to Camarines Sur? Oamaﬂnes Sui'!? The team's out-of-town trip. Didn't they tell you? We called for a truce. Mama is making an effort to reach out to me. It's better than not caring at all. Now, she runs after me. It feels good, babe. It it were the recruitment agency running after you tor your placement tee... you'd hate it too. Babe... Babe. Babe, it's not that I'm rushing things. I'm just worried that we might run out of slots. But I don't have money yet. Maybe we could look for other means. What means? What? Even my mother is into this already! I am also working for your placement fee, remember'? And you're not helping me! You think I just pull out money from my ass? Babe, I'm sorry. I'm just stressed out. I'm sorry too, babe. I'm just pressured. I want us to leave the soonest possible time. Didn't you date anyone on the cruise ship? I'm not like that. A woman won't cheat on her husband that easily. My mother did. She went to Milan. I was so sad because we were really close. At first, she was still sending us letters. Then after a week, she stopped. Even my father had no idea what happened to her. She died? Dad followed her to Milan. But when he saw her, she had a new family already. Dad went home and got depressed. He drowned himself in alcohol and died. Tell me the truth. Is Iza Calzado your mother? Except that in the movie, Milan, Piolo didn't die. He ended up with Claudine Baretto. Believe it or not, that's what happened to us. You're mom just left you like that? She brought me to Milan. I lived with her new family. But I was so mad at my mom because of what she did to my dad. So I returned to Manila and lived on my own. You left your family? Terry, we both left our families. The only difference is that you left them out of love... and I left them out of anger. I'm sorry. I used you to vent out my anger towards my mom. Do I look like her? You're of the same age. Can you please be more sensitive about that age issue... if you don't want to get in trouble tonight? Where is your mother now? Your mother is beautiful! It's all yours. I'll give you a ride back to the office. Thank you. Ritchie... You liked it? Was it big? What's big? The bill. You had dinner, right? I thought it was... Was it long? What's long? Your conversation! I'm sure you were talking while you were eating. You talk nonsense! But you know what, TL Vince is very hard. What? ! Ssh! What's hard? His heart... for his mother. That's it? That's all you talked about? Yes. You didn't talk about anything else? Guys, is this too sexy? Yes, it is! Cover it up or a tsunami might hit us. It still looks lewd. Just cover this one. - Perfect! Perfect! - There. You are not hiding my true beauty. Miss Korea has arrived! Why are you wearing heels on the beach? The Miss Universe candidates wear heels with their swimsuits. She has a point. That's it? Let me look at that. WOW! - She's taking off. - Oh, so many layers! Just like a rice cake covered in banana leaves. WOW! There should actually be five layers. Wait. This is very Anne. Anne Curtis? No. Anne... Anita Linda. How about this? Dirty Annie. Hey! I'm the Muse of the Seashore titleholder for three decades. For three decades you were the only woman in your community? Fm sure. Wait! The daughter is fiercer! You knitted that dress for this trip? - Beauty runs in the blood. - Wow! - There it is! - What'? This is Grindr. The one I've been telling you. - What's in there? - Let me see. - All gay men use this. - Hot body! I know! I hope he's handsome in person. He's just ten meters away! He's getting nearer! Five meters! I hope his face is hot as his body. - I like that! - True! - Almost there! - He's almost here! One meter? What a waste! Why'? Oh... What's up? What's up? Does a straight guy that use Grindr'? No! I'm just checking my Twitter accoount. Liar! If you were really straight, why would you wear trunks in the beach? Hashtag “Confirmed” Right! I don't know about you guys but as for me... I need to find my delicious prey now. Roar! Oh there he is! My meal of the day! Wait, he looks familiar. Your boyfriend? That's TL Vince! Huh?! Why is he here? I thought this was a vacation? Who invited him? I don't know. I think I did. Huh?! Why did you invite him? He's a party pooper. - We're supposed to be relaxing here... - Hi, guys. Hi, TL! Can you put sunblock on me? Good thing you made it. You want me to put sunblock on you? It's too much to ask of you. - Yeah right. - Let's go, guys. Wait. They might get the wrong impression. How embarassing! On your back? No... here. There. How scandalous. What more if she wasn't shy at all? She's enjoying it. Disgusting. - Let's go. Kids, show some respect towards your elders. The nerve! You're the self-proclaimed senior! Mother Teresa and I are up to any challenge! So that's why you put me here! You, witches! You can do it. You look like a man anyway. Hey, Vince. Take it easy. No! I like things rough! There you go! Let the games begin! Ready, get set, go! You're one huge monster! Pull! Vince! Will you take it seriously?! I'm serious about this! Ouch! Bullseye! Raul! I'm sorry, my sweetie! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry? It's obvious that it was intentional. Beach volleyball, anyone? Yeah! Let's go. Come on. I'm disgusted. Go. Hit! Mine! - Mine! - Mine! Mine! - Mine! Mine! Mine! - I said, it's mine! Hey, hit it! Mine! - Mine, again! - I said mine! - Mine! Mine! Mine! - Ouch! Woah! Nice! Sorry, sorry! - Are you okay? - No, I'm not! You enjoy taking things from other people... just like when you snatched the TL position! Regina! It's okay, guys! Teamwork! - Are you okay? - Don't talk to me! Okay! I can be Reg's substitute. - We don't want to play anymore! - Let's play! Let's play! - Let's go! TL! - Come on, let's have some drinks. Give the ball to her. - Give it to her. - There! Bye! - I'll play on my own. - Let her play alone. Okay, mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Hit to the other side. Mine! Mine! Mine! Why did you even invite me here? It seems like I spoiled the fun. This is your chance to be close to your team. And I'm sorry for my daughter. She just hates losing. Is it still her issue? What really happened? Why are you so tough on my daughter? Why does she see you as Satan's cousin? She was also up for promotion back then. She was expecting it. But I got the position. So she thought I took it away from her. Didn't you? No. I worked damn hard for it. That's why I get so pissed when she tells me... that I snatched the position from her. You know what? You and my daughter look good together. Why not court her? No! Never. It's not going to happen. As if my daughter is a leper for you to disagree like that. Terry it's not that. I already have a girlfriend. We've been together for two years. We're about to get married. Great! Let me be a principal sponsor. Wait, I need to pee here in water. We should do this more often. Once a year, I guess. You're right. Why aren't you asleep yet, sweetie? I'll go ahead, Terry. Good night! Good night! Reg, good night! Has the world turned upside down, Ma? I am the one waiting for you now. I'm sorry. We just enjoyed our conversation. Besides, you told me to enjoy this vacation, right? But I didn't tell you to flirt like a sixteen year old, Ma. Of all people, why does it have to be Vince?! Stop being judgemental! He was just talking to me, and you think I'm flirting already? Fine. Explain this, ”I'll go ahead, Terry. Good night.” He calls you Terry?! So what? If only Papa knew what you were doing. It's so easy for you to replace him. Ssh! Quiet! Your Papa might hear you! Ma! Why did you bring Papa's ashes? I don't want him to be left alone with Midang. What if he mistakes your father's ashes for pepper? Sweetie, don't listen to your daughter. You know how she can be a pain in the neck. I miss you all so much. - Babe, please talk to me. - Leave me alone! Babe, I really, really want you back in my life! - Just give me another chance. Please. - Will you get on your feet? - You're embarassing me. - Please, Babe! Just talk to me first, Lea. You're irritating. - Guard, will you please get rid of him. - No, no, no. Don't do this to me, Babe. - Wait, Wait! Babe! - Sir, you're not allowed in there. Babe! Vince? Hey! Let go of him. Who are you, ma'am? He's my son. What? Seriously? Yeah! Do you want me to show you all my stretch marks? Come my son. For many years, she was my only family. I was serious about her. I was even ready to propose to her. But when that day came... I was the one who got surprised. She broke up with me. What a jerk. Did she tell you why? Time. Since our schedules don't match we might not be a good match as well. I don't actually understand. It was sudden. So what did you say? I'm sure you begged her to come back. No! She hurt my ego. She won't get the best of me. If there's one thing I hate... it's a person who leaves others behind. So I told myself, one day she'll realize what she's missing. But it never happened. My world turned upside down. That's why now, I am the one begging her. Don't worry. We'll do everything to make Lea come back. I'll help you. Sure. Miss... Yes, sir? May we have our bill, please? Can I have your senior citizen card ma'am? You know what, you won't grow old anymore... 'MW. ma' am'!? Because I might kill you right now. \'m sorwmdam. What? Despite Mama's age, your twenty five year-old boss hooked up with her? Maybe she wants to be like Freddie Aguilar. What's wrong with that? Dating a cougar is the popular thing now. That's gross, brother! Is it okay with you that Mama's dating another man so soon after Papa's death? Hey... everyone! Hello! - Hey Ma! - Hi. - Hi, Ma! - Hi! Oh there's my lovely grandchild! - Ma! - Hi, Ma! Hi, Ma! Mom, where have you been? We've been waiting for you. I helped my boss with something. He has a very big problem. So what's new? ma' "1? Yes? What's with all the ﬂirting? Cut the crap, Midang! Bring all these to the kitchen. Wash the fruits. So how's work, Ma? I'm doing great. You can even ask Regina. My boss is happy with me. Please pass the rice. Happy? Or very hBPPY? What's with that question? VeW happy, I guess-. You seem to be all smiles, Ma. Has someone replaced Papa already? Well... What? So impatient? As of now, there's no one. Just finish your food. You ask too much questions. - Claire, how are you and my grandson? - Yes? We're fine. Give me some rice. How's your work in Cebu? Stressful? It's fine, Ma. Have more rice, brother. You're losing weight already. You're stuffing me up. Alright then, lets have more of that. Perry brought us goodies. Sweetie... Claire and Perry visited a while ago. Don't worry. They're doing fine. Isn't that great? They're all doing fine. Except one... My TL, Vince. Hey, that's Team Leader not True Love. You might get jealous. He's like a son to me. He's just like Regina. He easily gets pissed, always in a bad mood. Their only difference is that when you ask Vince... if he's okay, he will answer, “I'm not okay.“ You know what sweetie, I pity Vince. He doesn't have a family. That's why I spend time with him. I let him rant all he wants. Through that, I feel that I'm important to him. Sweetie, why is it like that? How come those who are not your children... are the ones who would rather be with you? Oh! Sorry, ma'am. You might be commiting suicide. Do you want me to kill you instead? - You're getting on my nerves! - No! No! No!! - Go away! - I'm just concerned. You really are annoying, Midang! Go away! My love, don't worry. We're almost there. Surprise! Babe? Babe, don't you know how to knock? Who are you talking to over Skype? What are you talking about? The one you're chatting with. Who am I chatting with? The hell, Dennis! Will you answer me properly? Apparently, you're calling someone “my love.” Babe... I'm just talking to the agency to lower our placement fee. I'm just helping you out and yet you're getting mad at me. What if I go back to her and beg for her forgiveness'? There you go again. That's the problem with you. You're pushing it too hard. You can convince a woman if she's in a good mood. But Lea's different! Take a step back, bro! I thought you wanted to help me? How come I have a feeling that you wanted me to stop? I thought! I thought! I thought! You've think too much! Will you stop speaking in English? We're not in the call center. I just want you to think about your strategy. It's like sales. For instance, Lea is the client. How are you going to sell yourself to her? Got nothing to say? You're a TL and yet you're not good at selling. Yeah right! So what's your secret, Ms. Employee Of The Month? You have to make it personal. Am I not being personal enough? You are. But the more you become pushy... the more you make Lea realize why she broke up with you. You have to remind her why she loved you in the first place. That's how Raul had me. He loved to remind me of our sweet moments together. Wait, hold on. Enough of your sweet husband in that urn. What should I do? When did you realize that you really love Lea? That's your mommy and TL Vince! Terry! You're great! You're the best! Mother of God! Your mother is acting like a teenager! I know! Come on. Let's eat. Let's just eat elsewhere. Let's go. You know what to do already. That's Regina! Regina! Wait! Reg! If you want, Vince, you can go ahead. Alright, I still have a meeting with the bosses. - Anyway, thank you! - Take care. Okay. I should've brought you to the place where Vince and I ate. Anyway, I just brought a cheesecake for you. Isn't this your favorite snack? How lucky of you to have a date. Regina, will you stop those nasty assumptions. For now, I don't need someone to replace your papa. You are enough. And you know what, you two are the ones who actually look good together. Whatever. My child! Yes, hello? - Everyone... - Okay, I'll call you back. I have one slot for an early out. Who wants it? Sir, please let me go home now. I haven't slept for three days. You're too whiny. That's just three days of no sleep compared to me who had three days of no men. Do you understand that, TL? You are all over reacting. I'm the one who is not working out for three days. Sir! I need my beauty rest. You just need rest - period. You don't have beauty. Sir, I'm not feeling well. - Okay Reg, it's yours. Rest well. - What? What? ! You're not feeling well, my child? You want me to bring you home? Don't bother, Ma. Your TL needs you. Are you sure? Wait, I'll just fix my stuff. I said, don't bother! If you need a mother, don't hesistate to text me! My daughter is really very independent. She is in a bad mood. These are all nothing. Sir, do you have one in trunks? I need it to keep me awake. Is this about Mother Teresa again? That's a different story, sister. So what's this? About Dennis? How did you know? Oh, Reg. Your world revolves around him. I caught him talking to someone over Skype. They're just talking. I smell something fishy. If I catch him cheating, I'm going to crush every single bone in his body. Did you tell this to Mama already? Of course, not. Why would I? I just might get pissed with all her ﬂirting. Reg, just let Mama do what she wants. Perhaps, that's the only thing that makes her happy now. You know what, I promise you, it wouldn't hurt to open up to her. Yes it would. She doesn't even know a thing about love. How I wish Papa's still here. Reg, stop thinking about that. Just relax, okay? Let's just enjoy the night. Stop thinking about it. Come on. Cheers! Hurry! it's almost five o'clock! She'll be coming out soon! - Who are you calling? - Regina. I'll just text her anyway. Why didn't you just buy flowers? You told me to make it personal, right? Do I look good? You Ioook handsome. - There she is! Go hide! - Wait. Oh Babe, with lust one look, I melt away. Vince... I'm sorry. Vince. That's it. It's really over. I'm okay. Hey, it's okay. I feel sad, Vince. It's too painful. I feel worse. And it's more painful for me. Of all the songs to choose from, why that one? That's the song she sang to me when we first met. That's when I realized that she's the woman for me. But now, it's over. Hey! You're overreacting! I'm the one who was dumped here! That's also the song Raul used to sing to me. It's okay. Let's move on together. I love you, mom. I love you, son. God... I hope no one screwed up again. The client wants to talk to you personally. Why must we have a Halloween theme today? Good morning, sir. How are you doing? Good Lord! What's up with that? It's costume Friday, sir. It's already Halloween here in the Philippines. Well, you scared the shit out of me. Is that your team? Yes, sir. Good. I want to make this short. I want you guys to take a look at this. Oh my God! And the good news doesn't end there. Reports are in and I am pleased to congratulate all of you. You've doubled your sakes quota for the month. And as promised, each 01' you will receive the 25,000 peso bonus. Congratulations guys! Congratulations, Vince! Keep up the good work. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Terry, that is all because of you. This is the first time that the team was commended. Congratulations! I love you! That's no big deal. My child, we did it! 25,000 pesos each! Is there a problem? Nothing. I'm okay. Let's give it up for Terry guys, come on! Let's do this! Ms. Manlapat, are you going to pay now'? I promise to pay next week. We are just waiting for our money. It's coming for sure. Are you with Mr. Dennis Demenes? Yes. How are you related? He's my boyfriend. I need to pee. Please check your boyfriend's documents. We need to prepare. Okay, we can manage the props. Good morning! We need to talk, asshole! Here? Can't we talk outside? Why do you look as if you just rose from the grave? Because I'll be burying you next! And I will tell everyone here all of your nasty shit, Mr. Dennis Demenes. Babe-- Stop calling me babe! Ladies and gentlemen, I just want you all to know that this respectable man... happens to have a wife and a child in the UK! Oh, that. I thought it was something serious. That's old news, young lady. So all of you know about this? Of course! And as honorable teachers of Honesty and Integrity Elementary School... you're not going to do anything? Mr. Demenes will just be here until the school year ends. He resigned already so we cannot give him any more sanctions. Right. Babe! Hello, my child? Good thing you picked up. You left early a while ago. I was supposed to leave with you. Hello, my child? Are you CYVMQ? What's your problem? I'm okay. Bye. You're not okay. Wait for me. I'm on my way-- Sir, please hurry. That was crazy. Just let it all out while TL is not yet around. I can't take it anymore! I want to talk to Papa! He's dead. Or my sister Claire! She's too far from you. Or my brother Perry! He's way too far. I don't think you can take calls right now. Come with me outside. Let's get some air. Come on. - Hello. - Good evening, ma'am! Excuse me. Good evening, sir! You're a TL and yet you're late? Look who's talking, Ms. Early Bird-. - Good evening ma'am, sir. - What's this? Sorry, but the elevator is under repair. Thank you. Let's take the stairs. Terry, wait. Can we drink water first? - Water? - Yes. Okay let's go down again. No, I can manage. Hurry, Vince! - Come on. - Wait. - My feet are sore already. - Are you giving up now? Come on! My feet hurt too! I don't care anymore if we are late! Ouch! I told you that we should rest for awhile. Push me! Push me more! Are you okay? The elevator is still not working. You're really good at this! Is that your mom's voice? - Wild! At the tire exit? And with a young man? - Is this your first time? You're doing great! Wait! Wait! Vince, wait. It's hot. I'm so wet. Come on, it's last ﬂoor. I don't want to do this again. My hips ache. Let's do again. One last round. Huh? Please. Fm getting there. Okay. Okay. Help me to stand up. Help me. Perverts! Huh... mY Child! Just hold on, says the tarsier! Vince, I loved you! My child! My child, wait! Regina! I'm talking to you! Don't you dare disrespect me! Don't talk to me about disrespect, Ma! Regina! Regina, what do you think were we doing at the fire exit? You think we were making out? If you were not making out, then what? Is that how you see me? Yes, Ma. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I don't know who you really are. I'm sorry it you spent those ten years having a good lite on that ship. When you came home my father died. And barely a month after you start flirting around! You didn't even think of Papa. You know what, Ma? I sometimes wish... that you were the one who died instead of Papa! You've crossed the line! I know that I've had my shortcomings. And I know that you're mad at me because I left you to work abroad. But no matter how many times I explained that to you... you never listened. When I was on that ship... did you ever ask yourself how your mom was doing? Has she eaten? Has she slept well? Is she in good health? Because there wasn't a moment that I never thought of you. You may have struggled too but at least you had each other. But I was all alone. When your father died... I thought that it was the most painful thing that happened to me. But you know what hurts the most now? It's the way you ignore me. You just pass me by. You don't even talk to me. You make me feel like I'm the most worthless person in the world. I'm sorry if this is how I treat Vince. Because he loves me as if he were my own child. A love that you never gave me! Claire, I have been a very bad daughter. I hurt Mama. I even used her to get a placement fee for someone else. - Have you apologized to Mama? - Not yet. I'm so ashamed of myself. I don't know how to face her. As soon as I get home... the first thing I will do is to apologize to her. Good thing you realized that you should apologize to me. Wait, I will call you back. You bastard. You want me to apologize to you? - Babe. Babe. - Are you drunk? Forgive me, please. - Babe, please. - Don't touch me! Have pity on me! I'll pay you back! - Let go of me! - Please! - Let go of me! - Babe, please. - Let go of me! - Babe, come on. Help! Help! - Sir, help me! - Dude, what are you doing? - She's my girlfriend. Let us in. - Let go of me! Let me go! - Terry. Terry, relax. - I don't understand that girl. It's okay. Everything's going to be fine once she comes to her senses. What happened to you? Hey! Ma'am! Regina! What happened to my daughter? She was kidnapped. What? Are you crazy? Why would she get kidnapped? We're not wealthy. A muscular man carried her off in a white taxi. Muscular? Vince, that's Dennis! - We have to go after them! - Okay. I'll just get my car. Hurry! Dennis! You're hurting me! Dennis, you're hurting the girl. - Let go of me! - Stay put! This is not what we talked about. I don't want to get involved in this! I don't have bad intentions. I just want to borrow money. What a lame scheme! Kidnapping? Are you serious? - Give me that! - What are you going to do with that? Give it back to me?! This is mine now. Don't tell me that you're asking for a ransom? This is quite expensive. - I'll sell this at Greenhills. - No! Give me-- They're in a white taxi. Wow! White taxis are really rare. Stop talking and just help me find them. Look for them on that side. - Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! - What is wrong? It hurts! I think I have a stiff neck. Let's do it this way. You look at the left side, and I'll look at the right side. Why did I even date you? I thought you're a good man like my Papa because you're a teacher. That looks like Reg! There! That's my daughter! Maybe at the bank. So you can withdraw money. - Your wallet is empty. Regina! Call them her attention! Ma! Ma! Hey! Damn you, Dennis. - Just keep driving! - Ma! Don't touch me! You bastard! How dare you hurt my daughter! Reg! Regina! Regina! - Are you, okay! - Regina, come here. You bastard! Mag - You jerk! - Wait! Ouch! Ouch! - No, Ma! Ma, that's Vince! - Terry! Stop! That's, Vince! Here! Here! Mag Vince! Mag Vince! Ouch! Mag - Ma! I'm sorry, Ma. - Ouch! - Ouch! Wait... my neck-- - Ma. Are you okay? Yes, Ma. It's okay, my child. - Come on Vince. Let's go home. - Ma, what happened to you? Reg, are you, okay? What happened to you? Here. It tastes good. There are still some more. Ouch! You think you're an action star. You really hate losing, don't you? Seriously, Reg? I got punched, remember? Don't I deserve a thank you? Thank you for saving my life. I'm sorry for thinking you were Mama's boyfriend. You just think that I'm tough, but I also get hurt. - Like this? - Ouch! Maybe I should do it myself? No, let me. It's okay. SOFT)'- - Reg, since I saved your life... - Yes? Can I ask you a favor? I know this may sound awkward and you may think that it's not right. But I hope you say yes. Sir, no! No, no, no! It's not that. I just want to ask you if... if you can go out with me for dinner'? I thought it was something else. Of course. Yes? Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - How cheesy. - Yes. Are you okay, my child? Of course, Ma. Here. What's this? For your placement fee. Ma, isn't it obvious that Dennis and I are over'? I know. But it doesn't mean that you shouldn't push through with your dreams. I know that you've been wanting to live your own lite. Do what you want to do. Do it for yourself. I'm sorry, Ma. It's nothing, my child. We're okay now. No, Ma. It's not okay. I'm sorry if I hated you for leaving. I was really hurt. I thought that you did not love me. That my mom left me because I wasn't worthy of being loved. My child, that's not true. You know I love you. I love you that much that's why I left. I could've stayed here if I had the choice. I wouldn't have to struggle. But I don't want you to suffer. I didn't want you to bear all the burden. I didn't want you to quit school. I couldn't take that. And even if I have to go through that over and over again for you, I would do it. Sweetie, ifs been a year now. A lot has happened. At last, Regina and I are okay. Even Vince has found the forgiveness he's been looking for. - I'm sorry, Vince. - No, mom. I'm sorry. - I love you, son. - I love you too, mom. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Perhaps, this is the point in my life where everything falls into place. Sweetie, I hope you're still here so you can see how happy we are. You should be the one singing your favorite song... not your daughter who is out of tune. Back then, I knew for whom I was sacrificing for. Now, they are still the reason I work hard. That's why in every struggle t go through... on a ship or in a call center... time may pass... timezones may shift, but life goes on. Natasha and Martin, you will be our new supervisors. 'Oh, my__ 'WOW! Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you, bro. So with that sweetie, ifs finally time to let you go. Raul, I'm letting you go, and yet you're the one who wants to stick around! Goodbye, Sweetie. Mwah! Claire, we're here at the airport. Let me talk to her. She wants to talk to you. Hello, sister. - Take care of yourself, Reg. - Yes, Claire. Take care. - Okay, bye. - Bye! Your airplane might leave you. Take care. Go ahead. Take care. Let's keep in touch through Skype. We hang on to things because we are afraid to lose them. But the more we hold on to them, the more they let go. Physical presence is not the only way to measure one's love. That's what I learned from Regina. To let things be.
