Great sound. I really can dig it. - See you later. - All right. Hey, brother, it's been a long time. Well, what have you brought me here? A little coke from Cuzco? I ain't dealing no more, man. You mean you isn't dealing no more. You heard about my last bust, didn't you? Well, three will get you five. That's a long time between drinks. You've come to sing me a song. What a beautiful surprise. Cash. Joplin. Dylan. Odetta. Million memories. What will you give me for it? It's come to this? I'm getting back in the music business. Really? That's great. Why don't you sell your 12-string. It's practically brand-new. I thought I could get more for this, man. You remember that time we were at the Shrine, me and Jesse? You dug that guitar so much... ...you said you wanted to buy it. Said something about $ 1000. Did I? Well, you were pretty stoned at the time. A lot of other cats have offered me the same. This is your guitar, Cisco. You don't want to buy it? Nope. Okay. - I'll see you, brother. - Ciao, baby. Now remember, the distinguished American philosopher... ...Satchel Paige said: "Don't look back. Something may be gaining on you." How's the old universe? - You ruined it. - Yeah. Can I have a cigarette? Yogis don't smoke cigarettes. - I see you got your tape back. - Yeah. What did they say? What do they always say? You're too good for them. That's what they said. Why can't you just be some nice, healthy Baptist like the neighbors... ...instead of squatting weird on the table like some freak. It's not weird. Yogis can do all kinds of good things. Documented too. - Like what? - Astral projection. Levitation. My daddy caught me levitating once. Told me I'd go blind. They can also make it for 24 hours straight. Make what? Sexual intercourse. You remember sexual intercourse. Yeah, but not for no 24 hours. Well, you have to be really good to do it. It's in an especial discipline. Now, I bet you know all the good ones, don't you? That's why all them dishes are in the sink. Because some diaper-wearing, skinheaded yogi... ...is teaching my old lady how to ball 24 hours a day. What's the matter? You afraid you're not up to it? I'd like to help you out, but I gotta do something tomorrow. - How about an hour? - How about a minute, missionary style. When you touch me It's easy to make me believe Tomorrow won't take you away - You pause after you say "make me." - Right. So all them teenyboppers think you're saying "make me," huh? Wonderful. But I'd gamble Whatever tomorrow might bring For the love that I'm living today Sing a round of the chorus now. 'Cause I'll never know till it's over Come on, you can do this. If I'm right or I'm wrong Loving you But I'd rather... "I'd rather be sorry," and we are sorry. Hello. Hey, Dragon, how's Black? No, man, don't call me about that no more. I'm through. I quit dealing. Yeah, why don't you try Buffalo. I think he's got something. Yeah. Dig you later, man. You snoop. - Are you sorry you quit? - Nope. No withdrawal pains? Not on your nelly. Come on, do this thing. Because I'm happy. I'm really happy. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm paying you for, right? I mean, if it wasn't no trouble, I wouldn't need no lawyer. Hey, I'll call you later, okay? You got a warrant? No, I thought you'd invite me in. Cisco, I don't have too much time... ...so I want you to take a little ride with me out to the Valley. I'm clean, man. I quit dealing. - No, no. - I'm retired. - Just a little ride to the Valley, okay? - I ain't dealing no more. You already busted me twice. - That's enough. - Cisco. - Maybe I can help you with that bust. - Great. Go ahead. Come on, search and seizure. I'll change my testimony. - You'll get off, okay? - Yeah, right. All I gotta do is give you some names. Forget it, man. I ain't telling you nothing. Come on, take a little ride with me, okay? I mean, bust me or leave me alone, man... ...but I'm not just going for a little ride with no cop. Okay, Cisco. Let's say that you're busted. Now, do you want to take that little ride? Jesus. There's a hundred keys, even. Whose is it? Open one up. - Where'd it come from? - Open one up, will you? Go ahead. What do you think? If they all come from the same place, it's bad dope, man. What do you mean? What's wrong with it? No. I mean "good" bad. Go ahead and try it. If you're setting something up, Holland, it ain't gonna work. No, I'll smoke some with you. Go ahead. Whose garage is this? It's mine. No, really, it's my garage. Thank you, operator. Well, there's a Betty Holland at that address. Then it's his garage. If it's his wife. He just might be straight. - You mean he's honestly crooked. - Yeah. I can't believe it. Well, if this is an attempt at entrapment... ...it certainly is the clumsiest one I've ever seen. You know, Cisco, if I were you, I'd steer clear of the whole thing. Yeah. It's incredible grass, though. How much...? Just blowing off... You know, blowing out the carbon: - Yeah. - Yeah. Come here. I gotta have $ 10,000 by Monday. - Monday? - Yeah. You get me that much by Monday, and the rest of it... ...you just fool around with on your own time. Whatever you make on it, you keep. That's an awful lot of grass to turn in two days, man. It's not really two days, though. You got the rest of today and, well, the weekend. That's like 59 hours. So you figure out it's... Well, about two keys an hour, if you want to figure it that way. Two keys an hour? Do I get to punch a time clock? Look, man, you're the hotshot dealer. You get it for me by Monday, or it's no deal. Okay. What about the prior? When it comes to court, I'll see what I can do for you. You can get off on an 844. It's a technicality. Nobody cares. One more thing. Why are you doing this? - I need the money. - Yeah, everybody needs money. Stocks and bonds, stuff you wouldn't understand. Don't tell me what I don't understand, man. I've had business managers and agents... ...that have put more bread in the market in one day... ...than you ever made in your entire police life. All right, I've got to make a margin call on Monday. I borrowed against my life insurance. What the hell difference does it make? Okay, you need the money... ...but you're, you know, a narc. - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't know. You do things... ...and one day you wonder why you're doing things. You know? I don't know. You said you were gonna quit, Cisco. You promised. I did, man, I quit. - What's all that? - Grass. Some of the best that I ever had, man. It's really good. It's all buds. Take a look at that. - You were going to quit. - I did quit. This is for us. We're gonna smoke it. I ain't gonna sell it. Why are you cutting it all up, then? Gotta ration it. Don't wanna smoke it all at once. I wanna give some to... Give a piece of it away to Rex when I check them tapes tonight. Sure hope you didn't spend a lot of money. You know we're gonna have to pay the lawyer. Didn't cost a thing, man. Buffalo gave it to me for that stuff I fronted him. It's dynamite too, man. It'll rip your head off. You wanna try some? Really. It's beautiful. Hey... ...you know I don't want to get busted again. Here, put this in the cookie jar, okay? Okay. I'm sorry. - Howdy. - Hi. It's in the back. - Twenty keys, right? - Yeah. Hey, man. What's that? What? What's what? On the hill. Who the hell's that? Somebody you know? No. You tried to set me up. No, man. Hey, man, I don't know nothing about that. Who the hell is that? Hey, I'll call you. - Okay, you son of a bitch. - What the hell...? - I quit. - People in the houses... Sell it yourself. Goddamn it. - You can't quit. - Watch me. You don't pull that kind of crap on me. We had a deal. Follow me. I'll get you the rest of the grass. I'm finished, friend. You were following me... ...and I ain't leading you to my customers. I should have known better than to get involved with a pig in the first place. Here. Do you want to die? Do you? No. No. You're gonna sell that stuff for me. You understand? - Yeah. - Yeah. You're gonna have my money for me, Monday. Understand? Yes. That's $ 10,000. Understand? - You agree? - Yeah. Yeah. One more thing. I want that money Monday morning, 9 a.m., right here. That's 37 hours from now, so you better get cracking. Are you all right? You really shouldn't smoke that much, you know. It's hard on your heart. Once your heart goes, that's all she wrote. You know, 54 percent of the deaths are caused by heart disease? You didn't know that, did you? Yeah. You gotta take care of yourself. You gotta... Monday, then. Right? - Right? - Right. Edgar. Cheeseburger and a cup of coffee. - Hey, Elvis, what it is? - Ain't nothing. - How you been, brother Buffalo? - I'm pretty good. - What you know? - Oh, Jesus. Hey, I'm glad I run into you, man. You ain't got any bread on you, have you? I got my pants on, don't I? Look... ...I got something I got overloaded on, and I gotta unload. Say, about 25 keys. I'll let you have it for 3750. Thirty-seven fifty? Man, that's a yard and a half apiece. I can get it all day for half that money. This ain't that shit you're used to dealing with, man. This is gold, Buffalo. I've been getting 300, 350 for it. And you been selling to them squares too. - I do all right. - Yeah, you do all right. And what you doing talking to me? Besides, I hear you got a case, man, and you're dangerous. The case ain't nothing, man. Something come up. I got in a bind, and I really got to get rid of some of it. How about that. I thought you was a man that could turn that weed. You know, move it. You got a taste on you? Yeah. You reckon you can tell how good it is just by a sniff? The nose knows. Better stake you out on the border, man. I'll talk to some of my associates... ...and we'll work something out, okay? I appreciate it, man. I really got my ass in a sling this time. Hey, man, what happened? I thought you could... ...make a million dollars in the record business a couple years ago. Now you're broke. Ain't that a bitch? Cop and blow. Cop and blow. You ought to know. I'm here. Hey, I'll be expecting a call. And watch out for falling rocks. You tell them rocks to watch out for me. Hey, man, what's happening? Hey, what's going on, man? - This is Cisco. - Hey, Cisco. What's happening, man? Didn't I hear you got busted, man? - Yeah, you probably did. - Did you? I probably did. I got it covered, though. I'm magic. Hey, man, I saw Moss. He said he run into Jesse in Taos, man. - When? - Last week. Man, he ought to be here by now. He's supposed to. - You guys getting a band together? - Yeah. Right. You ain't had a chance to hear them tapes yet, have you? I got them in here, man. Hang on a minute. Say, that 12, man. You gotta give me more EQ. - That's all there is. - But this does not sound right. - Change the mikes. Put it to E-13. - The drums are leaking like a wino. Put it on 9 and put the drums on 10 with a different mike, and we'll have it. - This is the second time. - You got it. This is cool, you know. Maybe that'll take care of it. It's just too freaked-out and too... Want that old groove. That old groove, man. - Hey, man, what's happening? - How'd you like it? Well, man, I tell you, you come off with some weird bags, man. I don't know. It just ain't like you and Jesse used to do, man. - Just get on, man. - That's the same thing... ...they was telling us back then, that we was too weird. It wouldn't hurt you to get out of that border bag and try something different. I don't know, man. You know me though, man. You know I'm a simple cat, man. I like that simple stuff, man. You know where the groove is at. That California thing, I don't get it. That far-out-in-space music, man. Play the real thing. You know, man. Oh, hell, I guess that's what makes horseraces, ain't it? When Jesse gets here, you'll know what to do. You cats get it together. You can do it. Here. It'll come together. You know where the groove is, just work it out. I love you, man. I gotta lay something on you. Buffalo really pulled a number on me. Came off lame. He gave me that bad shit, and my head just hurt. It's terrible, man. It's just... Nothing happens, man. I want some of that good stuff, man. I want to get high. - Like big taste, you know? Big key. - Yeah. - You sure it won't be no problem? - No. Ain't no problem. - Great. Let me get my manager, man. - What for? He does the bread trips, man. That's his gig, you know. Man, I don't sell you grass. No, man, but you know... I mean, that's his gig, man, you know. I want a whole big key. A big bunch. - I'll give you a key. - Man, let me get him. Hang on a minute. Hey, Sim. Sim! - Don't you even want to try it? - Take back your 20 percent, man. Hi. I'm Sim Valensi. Yeah, I know. Cisco Pike. Let's go outside, huh? I saw you guys at the Forum in... When was it, '68? - The Shrine, '67. - Oh, yeah. Big grosser, that show. You haven't done much since then, huh? What's your lowest price for a key? - What? - A key. How much? - Two hundred. - I'll give you 150. - What'd you say? - I said I'll give you 150. You will, huh? Well, fuck you. How about that? No, I gotta have cash, man. I'm on kind of a tight schedule. Okay, 3:00, right? I'll see you there. - Are you a dealer? - Nope. - What's that? - It's my girlfriend's. You know Lynn Goodson? I was supposed to meet her here or at The Source. Do you want to go to The Source? I'm kind of tied up, baby. - Well, then will you sell me a pound? - Of what? Anything you've got. I'm not choosy. Yeah, I can do that. You know, it's a rather interesting accent you have. How long did it take you to learn it? Not long. I majored in shit-kicking. That's an interesting shape you got there. You're kind of pregnant, ain't you? No, I'm just holding it for somebody for a couple more months. If you won't take a check... Did I ask you if you'd take a check? No, gotta do cash. Well, then, if you won't... ...I guess we'll just have to go to my house. Is that all right with you? You silver-tongued devil. You talked me right into it. Don't quit your daytime job, baby. - You Rex's dealer? - No. I thought you were selling it to him. I happened to have some grass at the time. I talked them into recording him in the first place. We're friends. - Here. - And now you're dealing. I used to be a teenage idol. - Hell, what do you do? - Nothing. Nothing? It's nice work, if you can get it. Daddy ain't giving me enough pocket money. He thinks I'm spending it all on drugs. - What are you spending it all on? - Drugs. Your daddy's a good judge of character. Lynn! - Bye. - Bye. Hi. We're going over to my house. Do you want to come with us? - Who's he? - Cisco. Okay, Cisco. - What a flat little tummy. - Move your ass over. Only 24 pounds I've gained. He's Rex's dealer. No, he's Rex's friend. Well, are you Rex's dealer or are you Rex's friend? What sign are you? Libra. - What? - Son of a bitch. Now you've done it. Are you holding? - Yes. - Are you? - Yep. - Goddamn it, start swallowing. - Give it to me. - Do you have it? - Wait a minute. - Hurry up, goddamn it. Here he comes. Give it to me. Have fun. Come on, goddamn... All right, eat some yourself. - Here. Here's another one. - You bitch. Stick that in your mouth. - Evening. - Son of a bitch. Let's see your license, please. Now, let's see, where...? Oh, it's a comb. - You gotta have your license with you. - I'm looking, I'm looking. Here. Thank you. I stopped you because you were doing 45 in a 35 zone. - I was doing 45 in a 30? - Yes, you were. My goodness. Fancy that, I was doing 45. You still live at this address? What is that address? Let me see. Oh, yeah, I do. I almost moved, but I changed my mind at the last minute. - You know why? It cost about... - Ma'am. ...fifty dollars an hour just to move your furniture. - Will you sign there, please? - I was low on money that day. I see. Will you sign right there, please? Your signature's a promise... ...to appear in court sometime on or before this date. It's not an admission of guilt. - I should hope not, in America. - Here's your copy. In some countries you're guilty until you're proven innocent. Nice it's not like that here, isn't it? What are you chewing? - A whole lot of... - Say that again, please? Gum. - It's gum, huh? - Dentyne. Good thing you know what to do with it. Good for your breath. You should try it. Okay, thanks. Did you catch his bow tie? Did you catch his breath? You're gonna get yours, baby. Morning. You're up early. I sat in on Rex's session last night. Played bass. How was it? It was okay. He didn't dig the tapes much, though. He's got crummy taste. No. He's okay. He's got his limits, but he's okay. He's got his head back in the rocking '50s. Don't know how he keeps selling. Well, he does. Henry Folks called. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. One of his chickens got killed by a dog. Wouldn't be surprised if he's making it with those chickens. That's all he talks about. He wanted some grass. I told him you quit dealing. Good. He gonna get a new chicken? David Rubiloss called too. What's he up to? There's a rerun of his Bonanza tomorrow night. He wanted to watch it on our TV. He also wanted some grass. What'd you tell him? Same thing I told Henry. Great. Only he seemed to think you just got some more stuff. - I don't know where he got that idea. - You don't? No. Everybody always thinks I got dope. I guess so. Rex called too. When? About two hours after you left the session. He said he wanted another key, and you could drop it by his house. His manger will pay for everything at his office, you lying son of a bitch. - Let me go. - You gonna let me explain? Okay, so explain. Why in the flying pink Jesus are you dealing again? There's a reason. Five years, that's a reason. Your ass has been busted twice. You're gonna be in jail for five years. Five years. - No way. I'm magic. - No way? Look, Cisco, I love you... ...but if I have to go through the paranoiac horribles again... ...I'm gonna split. Now, it's me or dealing, man. Make up your mind. Well, I got this situation where I can get off the last bust, I think. After this load, I'll quit. Then we can leave L. A... ...or go somewhere or something. You're the one who wants to leave L.A., aren't you? Thanks for listening. Yeah, I'm listening, Toni. Okay, let's make it the 6:15 flight. Yeah. Oh, hell, give me a suite. I may have to do some business. Right. I'm glad you came by. I've been trying to get in touch with you. I wasn't able to get ahold of that money today. Four hundred, right? Right. Well, that's really a problem, then. See, we... Well, we're working out of Nevada... ...and we're having trouble getting money out of it. So if I can, I want to use soft dollars. I'd like you to sign a contract. You know, that you, like, did some work for us, so I can deduct it. Yeah, I know. When do I get paid? In a couple of days. Don't worry. That cost money! Yeah? How much does this cost? All right, I'll give you a personal check. It's all I've got. Is today the 8th? If it bounces, I'll kill your ass. I'll never do business with you again. Careful with these. Don't want them ripping on you. - They're 150 each. - Right. And 30 of them. That makes 4500, right? Right. I'll pay you when I get back. Don't you have it? Did you expect it? Yeah. Sorry. Maybe I'd better go with you. Okay. He's got a yellow Corvette. We're gonna do it here? Yeah, he's parked in back. There he is. - How you doing, Reed? - Hey, how are you doing yourself? We'll see. This is the guy I was telling you about. Hi. - You got the stuff? - You got the bread? Yeah, I got it. Good. Show it to us, then. We'd like to see it before we go get the stuff. You don't have the stuff here? It'll just take a couple of minutes. It's 4500, right? Let's see it. Forty-five hundred. Want me to count them? No, that's all right, man. It just pays to be careful, okay? - Okay. - Look, he's all right, man. Yeah, I'm sure he is. Okay, man. Look, we'll be back in a flash. Don't go away, okay? Okay. Hey, man. - Hey, Croner. - Get in there. - Does he know where you live? - No. He's all right, man. Yeah, he's all right. We'll get the bus here. Get that bus! Well, we got away, I guess. Man, you just cost me 30 keys of dope that I ain't paid for yet. What went wrong? Who do you owe this money to? Is it a lot? Yeah, Cisco Pike, 44. Any message from Buffalo? Ten o'clock, Troubadour. Out of sight. How about Jesse Dupre? Jesse. - Hi, Sue. I'm back. - Hi. Thank you. - How are you? - Good. - Hey, man. - Hey, how you doing? You should've told me you was coming. - Christ, it's good to see you. - I can't get out of here. Why didn't you call? - We'd have had a party or something. - Yeah? We're gonna get it on, man. Get it on. You know, you look a little beat. I've been driving four days, man. Lost some weight too, ain't you? Hepatitis. Turned yellow. Ugly. - You've been using? - A little speed for the drive down here. But then I took an upper to... No, I took a downer for the up. But I'm ready now, buddy. I'm ready now. Been feeding him good, honey? Yeah, Jesse, I've been feeding him good. He looks old. I'm gonna go put these in water. Came clear down here just to see you. He's wasted. He's a wreck. I don't know why I ever thought it would work in the first place. He hasn't slept in three nights. He looks 20 years older, for chrissakes. Hey, man, you got a towel around? Just a minute. Sue... ...that money... ...I owe $ 10,000. I've got to get it by the morning. And I owe it to a narc. You getting any more gigs, man? Yeah, Ed Sullivan wants me. What's wrong? I gotta go out. Do you wanna come? How about it, you wanna come with me? Yeah. I gotta get myself straight first, though. I've been up two days, man. Gotta stay awake. Is that how you got hepatitis? No. My natural swamp ways just caught up with me. Look, I got a nickel bag left. Do you want some? No. Okay. Man, I woke up one morning, I had this lizard in my head. I said, "Man, this ain't getting it." So I split. It's the best goddamn thing I ever did. Virginia, man, wanted me to work for her old man. Plumbing. Pipes, man. Pipes. Man, she was really a cow. Dumping that bitch was the most sincere thing I ever did, man. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, we gotta get a group together, buddy. - Yeah. - Who are you thinking about? - Billy? Donnie? - Yeah, you and me. There's Swan and Fritz. - Yeah. What's Fritz doing now? - Driving a Yellow Cab. Oh, shit, man. Hey, listen, this time we save our money, man. No more color TVs or Hollywood sports cars. We take our time, get it tight, and then slip it in there, slick as shit, man. Sweet Jesus, look at that little ass, man. God, it's beautiful. Oh, you missed it, man. God, they're all over the place, man. Makes you wanna smile, don't it? We gotta get us some ladies tonight. You know any? Yeah. That goddamn Virginia, man. A man's gotta have his outside women too, you know that? Yeah. - The kids take it hard when you left? - I imagine. Screw it, man. I'm gonna provide for them when we make it. I'll give them half my share. Besides, I got some accident money left. - What's that? - I got in a car wreck... ...and sustained some heavy brain damage. That's the easiest one to pull now. Whiplash don't work no more. But brain damage, man, that's the easiest one. Ten thousand, just like that. I'm lucky like that, man. Things happen to me. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna, Krishna Hare, Hare Oh, wow, man, it's been a long time. - It's the same, though, ain't it? - Yeah. Why don't you go get us a table. My man. - Naked beauty. - Hey, how you been? - Compared to what? - You know. Seen Buffalo? - Just left. - Damn it. What's wrong? What'll you have? Two beers. Hi. Jesse, right? Remember me? - Joyce. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I remember. - How you doing? - Fine. Hey, you look great. You know, those green eyes of yours match that green blouse you've got on. I just got married. - Billy Cole. You know him? - I don't know Billy Cole. Well, we just got married. That's great. I just got unmarried. Beautiful. Guess who? You were supposed to guess. Why didn't you guess? I'm too tired for games. It ain't my day, baby. This here's Jesse Dupre. Fastest fingers in the West. Yeah, I used to see you around a lot. This is Merna. That's Lynn. Hi, Lynn. Those green eyes go great with that red blouse. Yes. - How's it going, buddy? - Terrible, man. Buffalo disappeared. You guys did "Breakdown," right? "Breakdown." Man, that was my favorite song in junior high school. - Junior high? - Paul Revere. Well, l... I was in junior high once. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Did you guys split up? Yeah. - Why? - I don't know. Why did we? I think it was when Virginia got sick, wasn't it? Oh, yeah, yeah. That was the time I gave her the clap. Well, she got over it. That was the famous cold winter of '66. '66, man. Seemed longer than that. '66. You wouldn't have believed it, Lynn. Things were really insane then. Remember the Fred C. Dobbs? - Couldn't forget it. - It was a great place. Jimi Hendrix used to go there a lot. Hey, what are you into now? We're into selling 10 keys of grass. Know anybody who wants to buy them? Maybe my neighbors. What kind of neighbors you got? They entertain a lot. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna, Krishna Hare, Hare - Hi. - Hi. Where's Jack? I don't know. He's not in here with me. Why don't you try the courts. Thanks. My house is over there. Right over there. Wait here. Hold it a minute. - Hi, Merna, how are you? - Hey, Jack. - Hey, you like my alligator? - Beautiful. Still wearing alligators? - Yeah. What's up? - I brought Cisco over. - Hi there. - Howdy. Tell you what, I'll do 10 bricks if it's good boo. - It's good. - Yeah? No, no. Why don't we break open one of the bricks. Let's go in there. You must do a little business yourself here. I don't sell it, I give it away. Business gifts. You know, it seems like most of my clients are heads. Come on in here. - You often get stuff like this? - Yeah. - We're gonna have to keep in touch. - Right. - Two hundred a key, huh? - Yeah. You seldom get grass like this. Well, that's 10 keys at 200 a key, that makes it, let's see... That makes it pretty ridiculous, doesn't it? This is the best grass in L.A., man. That's what I get it for. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll give you 150 a key. Discount for quantity, okay? No. Then we don't have a deal. 150 a key, and that's it. Well... ...we can always get it from the Dandlers. Yeah. Dandlers. He deals to Dandler? Sure. You mean Dandler pays you 200 a key? Yeah, in quantity. I got 250 from him once. Dandler. That's out of sight. Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. This time I'll pay you. Dandler. But next time you sell it to me for less, okay? You're on, man. Next time I'll give it to you for nothing. You have saved my ass, baby. I'll dance at your wedding. Jesse, it's done, man. I got the money. We're home free. Cat bought all 10 keys. Hey, you two can't have coitus now. You mean he can't do it now. What do you expect? I haven't slept in four days... ...in the back seat, no goddamn room. Jesus. How am I supposed to know you haven't slept for four days? - Never mind. - All you told me... Never mind. We're going to my house. Then you can do it. Excuse me. Not me. Goddamn speed. - You need some reds? - No. I need some scag. You got any? - No, man. - I've got some. Fat city. Let's go. Hey, man. That kind of thing happens to everyone. It's the goddamn speed, man. That's why Virginia left. Do you really think we can get it back together again? - Sure we are. - I don't know. Changes, man. Well... Well, at least you sold your stuff. It ain't fun no more. What? Selling it. - Is Cisco Pike here? - He's out now. - When do you expect him back? - I don't know. He's... I don't know. Listen... ...I realize this is a little unusual, but could I have a glass of water? Okay. Thank you. Could I ask you for a favor? It's all right. It's all right. Could you take my pulse? What's the matter? You've never taken anyone's pulse before? No... I mean, yes, I have. What are you doing? Nothing. I just... I was just gonna get a Kleenex. - Why do you want a Kleenex? - I blow my nose a lot. Tachycardia. What? Paroxysmal tachycardia. I passed out twice last month. - What do you do for it? - Run. When it hits me, I run. It takes the flutter away. Just like this. Excuse me. - I've got the kitchen. - Okay. You got anything to drink? No. What do you think we are, rich? Hey, man, do you remember that little chick in Philadelphia? Flat, 14, never been kissed. He was so proud of that sweet virgin, he wouldn't let her out of the sack. And when we left town, she looked like she'd been hit by a train. Those were the good old days. Daddy's sleeping. Cisco. Wait a minute. What, man? There's something that's been worrying me. I just gotta get it off my mind. It's... It's my age, man. I mean, it shows, you know? Man, if you're still worried about that business in the car, forget it. That's not what I'm worried about. I'm worried about when we get up on that stage again, under those lights. You know, the wrinkles, it's... I don't know, maybe it don't look too good. Oh, Jesse, man. What? Hey, man, it's true, isn't it? Oh, fuck me. It ain't your goddamn body they're after, man, it's your soul. Thank you, man. I was more worried about that than anything else. Well, you ain't worried now, are you? - No. - Well, then, let's get it on, man. That's your favorite song, too, huh? - You want some? - No. "For those of you who suffer from..." God. "...lizard legs, I have a remedy. Squeeze orange rinds between your fingers... ...and rub the orange oil on your legs. This is very inexpensive, and it smells nice, too, if you dig oranges. - Beware of the dye... - Buffalo? ...some companies use." - Cisco, man. I've been trying to get ahold of you. I got ahold of your old lady. I'm getting in the music business, man. Come on, buzz off, you son of a bitch. I'm tired of the company I gotta keep with the old racket here. It ain't no challenge no more, Buffalo. Yeah, no, everybody wants me to. Jesus. Goddamn. Jesus Christ. What are you doing? Nothing. Don't wake my father up. You're gonna wake up my father. I mean, moving your stuff, I'll do it for you. What are you doing? What the hell's going on in there? And here. Jesse. Wake up, man. Wake up, Jesse. Get me some salt and clean this out. Get on out of here and get me some. Come on, Jesse. Don't quit on me, man. Oh, God. Breathe. Breathe, damn it. Breathe. Oh, God. Cisco. Cisco, that cop's in the house. He scared the shit out of me. What's wrong with Jesse? I'm gonna take him to the beach. We're going to the beach. What happened? Oh, my God, Cisco, what happened? He died. He OD'd. We can't just leave him here. Why don't we phone an ambulance? We'll tell them there's a body here. They'll take care of him. Okay? The police are gonna come. They'll want to know what you were doing with him. I'm gonna phone. Hello, l... I need an ambulance. There's a man on the beach. Rose and Boardwalk, in Venice. Looks like he's dying. Thank you. What are you doing? I phoned. Don't go back in there. He's in there. He's crazy. I gotta pay him. Not now, Cisco. Please, let's get out of here. I got the money, and I'm gonna pay him. Cisco, what are you doing? Do you hear me? I don't believe this. - Hey, Holland! - I'm leaving. Holland! I'm leaving. Cashier's check for the rest of the money. - Is that your girlfriend? - Yeah. She's a nice girl. Yeah, she is. That's what I said, she's a nice girl. I don't insult women. I didn't say you were. But that's what you thought, right? Why don't you count it? Cisco, I think you're a little short. Okay, man, bust me. - Bust my ass all over the place. - Wait a minute, calm down, will you? - I want to explain something to you. - Yeah? Did you believe that stock market story? Did you? I thought so. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I want to show you something. - Show me later, man. - No, I want to show you now. Come here. Come here. You know what this is? No. - It's our pay scale. - Jesus. Wait, wait. Wait a minute. I want to tell you something that's very logical. - Let me go, man. - You're gonna stand here and listen... ...because this is very logical. You see that right there? That's me. I'm a sergeant. Seventeen years service at $998 a month. For the top man in the field. You know what a rookie gets? No, I don't. You know what I get after 20 years? I've got 17 years in now. You know what I get after 20 years? No. Forty percent of my base pay. You know what I get after 19 years... ...if something happens and I have to quit? No, man, I don't. Look, I don't feel very much like rapping here. I understand. I understand. Do you know what I get after 19 years? - No. - Nothing. Not a goddamn thing, that's what I get. I have to go over my physical on Monday. You know what they'll say? It's non-service connected. And I know it's service connected. It's very unfair. The Jacob survey, you know anything about it? - No, I don't. - The Jacob survey says... ...there should be provisions made for hazardous duty. $ 100,000 the department spent on the Jacob survey... ...but it comes in too late for me. It doesn't go into effect until next year. - I'm going, man. - It is service connected. I know it is. It's from driving around in this goddamn smog. What is that? That's a siren. What do you take me for? What do you mean? Don't underestimate me. I'm not underestimating you, man. It's a setup. I know a setup when I see one.
