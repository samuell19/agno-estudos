My head feels like a gallon of water stuck in a soda can. Is it leaking out of my eyes? -: Soda or water? -: Soda. : Let me see. Nope. Just water. We should start before I explode and drown us both. Hello. My name is Morgan. And this is my true lover, Jordan. Wait, you have to explain what this is first before you introduce another person. Haven't you ever made a suicide video before? Fine. Uh, this is our digital love letter to each other and our farewell video to our family. ♪ I want to know how to survive in the nightlife ♪ ♪ I click my heels and dance with the heat rise ♪ ♪ I want to know how to survive in the nightlife ♪ ♪ I want to know how to survive in the nightlife ♪ ♪ The truth and dare of the drug from the baseline ♪ ♪ The desire that the voodoo gives to a weak mind ♪ ♪ I want to know how to survive in the nightlife ♪ ♪ The truth and dare of the drug for the first time... ♪ ♪ I want to know how to survive in the nightlife... ♪ I have to go home. No you don't. Tell me something about yourself. Maybe next time. But I'll always remember this night kissing that very attractive boy girl. It's girl boy. Can I have your number? How about I get yours? I don't have a phone. Why don't you have a phone? Cause I don't have a phone. Just... give me your number But don't call me. Your arms look like my arms. Your eights looks like a nines. It is a nine. My nines look like eights. I have to go home. My name is Jordan. Goodnight, Jordan. Don't be sad if I don't call. I won't be. Don't be mad if I do call. You won't. How do you know? I gave you the wrong number. Shit! You sting me cause I stole the girl's money? Morgan Gandara. It's her birthday today. You're late, Morgan. I stopped for pie. Enjoy the movie? It was... interesting. Hey honey. Are you hungry? There's some cake left. No, I stopped for pie Mom. Get some rest. Your appointment's at eight. I know. Bailey awake? He's asleep. Did you enjoy your birthday, darling? I did. Thanks. Goodnight. I love you both. Goodnight. We love you too. Jordan. What the hell? You missed your own birthday party! Sorry. Where's my money? Tomorrow. I promise. You said that yesterday. Can you stay longer? Go back to sleep, Misty. The dragonfly boy couldn't stop thinking of the princess of bees. He became obsessed with her. He was falling in love. Madly. But he knew the queen bee would never allow them to be together. The metastatic tumor has grown and is creating pressure in Morgan's skull. Her brain tissue is swelling at an alarming rate. She's never mentioned any pain. The only thing she's felt are these headaches. I mean it's possible the tumor is shrinking. Possible, but it's unlikely. We need to take the next step. More chemo? We tried that and it still came back. Well chemotherapy isn't as helpful when you're dealing with metastatic tumors. We would need to take a more aggressive approach. No! Isn't there a way you can just remove it? That's what the doctor says. I heard her speech is different. And today she dropped her purse. - She was getting out of the car and she dropped her... - Decreased coordination is a symptom. We need to get her to MD Anderson in Houston. - We're just running out of options here. - Why Houston? Why not here? Well Janet, this form of cancer at this stage, is... I'm afraid it's irreversible. The swelling in her brain is only going to get worse. At least in Houston, they can monitor her condition better. They are the best in the country. And if we don't go... How much longer are we looking at? I don't wanna hear this shit! Oh Bailey! Sweetie! Sorry. They're just so sick of hospitals and Morgan really just wants to be at home with the family. I understand. It's difficult to say how long. Three months, maybe. Three months? Oh, god! Alright c'mon. Let's go! Let's go! - Oh yeah? Nope, nope, nope! Oh! Maybe she shouldn't be exhausting herself like that. She's just trying to make Bailey feel better. Well, Bailey's fine. If she falls... Dennis! Don't. Just let her spend time with her brother. Who won? Half time! I'm up by three! Yeah right. He cheated. His foot was on the line. He's up by two! - Janet? - I just need some time! Well, wait. Does Morgan Gandara live here? Do you know her? I found her wallet. I'm here to return it. So she here or no? I can take it for you. I'd rather hand it to her myself if it's all the same. Where did you find it? Wherever she lost it is where I found it. You Scottish? I can see where she gets all the questions from. So you do know her? Yeah, uh. Look, just tell her I called. You mean came by? Just say I called, she'll get it. Yo, why are you wearing a skirt? My jersey was dirty? You getting signatures for some gay rights petition? C'mon Bailey! That's enough! Would you sign it if I was? C'mon, Dad. Just sign his petition! Love is love around here! He's not looking for signatures. He found Morgan's wallet. Huh. - Morgan! Door! - No no no! Oh. - You got a visitor. - You know this character? Yeah. What are you doing here? I would have called, but uh... I guess I just have the wrong number. I found it. I must have left it in the theater. Must have. Dad. You're just gonna stay in here and watch them flirt with each other? Okay, i'll just... I'll just go somewhere else. Yeah. So, Morgan! What movie did you two see again? - What was it called? - Bailey! Shut up! "Bailey, Shut up!" He's cute. Yeah. Thanks for unstealing my wallet. You're welcome. So, can I come in? Why? There's no valuables inside. I just want to see where the dragonfly sleeps. Why do you have an Asian brother? Because I have an Asian brother. Satisfied? It's just a room. I sleep there. You happy now? What are you, a "flasher" on the weekends? A flasher? Well you know, those guys that run into a crowd, open their coat, flash everyone their cock and then run out. That's a detective's coat. My Dad was a detective, so I kind of grew up in that fold. So that's what you wanna be when you get all grown up? Take over all your dad's unsolved cases? Maybe. Look, I don't mean to be mean. But uh... I'm really tired. Well I'm not leaving until I find out something about you I like. Right now, you're pretty perfect. Close your eyes. You won't like this... What are you gonna do? Flash me? My eyes need to be open for that. I'm pretty sure I'll like what I see. Close them! Okay, open them. Who am I? I don't know. Inspector Gadget? Inspector Clouseau! From the Pink Panther? The famous French detective? Are you serious? I mean I heard of the Pink Panther, but I always thought it was a - kinky sex position. - Unbelievable! We're watching one. Didn't we just see a movie last night? My parents worry a lot. Movie theaters are much safer than night clubs. Depends on the movie. Well, if you're not leaving How about I show you the entire movie in five minutes interactively? What do you mean? You have exactly 30 seconds to hide this key anywhere in this room And as a highly experienced detective, I will find it no more than three minutes. Hmm. You wanna bet on that? What you got? It's not what I got. It's what I want. And what's that? You. If you lose, you have to spend the entire night with me. And if I win, you leave immediately and you never return. You're on! I'm going to blindfold you. Girls cheat. Don't peek. I'm hiding it now. Done. Solve the case, detective. Most cases are solved not by knowing where it is hidden, but by whom it was hidden by. You give up? Um... Never. I gave up giving up many years ago. You want a hint? Oh, but you have already given me so many. Bullshit, have not. I know exactly where the key is hidden. You're bluffing. Am I? I raise the bet. If you lose, You have to feed me and you have to spend the night with me! And when you lose, you leave. But before you do, you cook for my entire family. I don't cook. Then I better be bluffing. Deal! First thing to know when you are given a case is expect the unexpected. That way you won't be surprised by anything In this case, the unexpected is expected. I would never expect you to hide the key somewhere where I'd expect it to be so that's exactly where I should expect to find it. You scare me. Just as I expected. But how? Same way you got my wallet. Use the blindfold as a decoy like your kiss. About your wallet, I'm sorry. Everything's still in there. I... tried to steal it at first but I got punished, so I put it all back. Who punished you? One of your private eyes. Little fella, black and yellow suit. I got stung by a bee! It's not my bee. You're a very strange girl, Morgan. No. I'm a hungry girl. I'm starving. Where's your girlfriend Patience, Bails. Girlfriend? He's not my girlfriend. Wait, "he's"? I'm confused. So, who's this guy? Clearly? He is just different, that's all. And you met this different guy at the theater. I'd hardly call him a guy, Mom. Why? Is he... Oh! Is he one of those metrosexuals? Is he pretty? You'll see. He expresses himself, that's what's important. Not everyone is brave enough to do that. How is it wearing a skirt makes you brave? Like a kilt, you mean? Like a, Irish? Oh, Scottish! No. He just likes skirts, so what? All of you behave. Dad, be nice. When am I not nice? - And there's a man at the door. - Yes, just... I can't wait to see this. Pizza? I thought he was making dinner. No, I was making dinner... happen. And it's happening. Mom! What? Don't stare. - Oh, I'm-- - No, it's okay. If I'm going to look this pretty, I have to get used to the attention it brings, right? I didn't catch your name. I'm Jordan. Dennis. That's a strong grip, Dennis. I'm Janet. I assume you've met Bailey. I did. Aw yeah. I shall call you Air Jordan. BOOSH! Let's eat! So, Jordan... Where are you from? I don't like to focus on the past much. Waste of time if you ask me. Well, where's your family? Dad! It's just a question, Morgan. Well I'm assuming... my Mom is exactly where she was when I left. On the couch. And my Dad, well, he left before I was me, so there's that. Have you lived here long? I just sorta go when it's time to go. Not much for nesting, personally. I like to travel as well. What statement are you trying to make by wearing that skirt? Dad! It's just a question! I'm just curious as to what compels him to dress like a female. He shouldn't do it if he can't answer why he does it. Isn't that right, Jordan? I guess I just find it a little disturbing that society says girls wear skirts and dresses and boys wear pants and cargo shorts. It's all the same fabric cut differently. We're all the same people, raised differently. So, wearing a skirt is just your way to rebel against society. I understand that. It's not rebelling, it's just simply acknowledging the fact that this stereotype is bullshit. Why not just wear what you want to wear? Be who you want to be? Yeah, I agree. You know, makeup was common with men in the old days. See? It's about self liberation. Free yourself from the shackles of conformity. Yeah, sure. Become unemployed Get a gun, do drugs As long as it expresses your individuality. Whoa, who said anything about a gun? Guns are for pussies who can't fight. How about we change the subject? How do you plan on supporting a family? How are you ever going to finance a house? I don't need a house. Jordan, have you ever been arrested? - Dad! - Please! That's extremely rude. Jordan, let's eat the rest upstairs. I just want to know why he has no regard for the rules put in place. No, dammit. Don't... Jordan, take anything that he says personally. He's just, he's a... he's an old fart. He just, you know doesn't want his daughter dating a domestic terrorist, bro. Domestic terrorists are usually well educated, white, ultra religious, second amendment loving right wing fanatics! I'm a poor, unemployed Atheist mutt. I'm like a father's dream come true! You're worse than he is. I'm eating alone. It was lovely meeting you all. Morgan! - Oh, come on! - What the hell? You were a hippie once too. That's not a hippie! I was nothing like that! Morgan is a gay lesbian. Oh sweetie, your sister is not a lesbian. Lesbians like girls, but if the lesbian is gay, she likes boys. She's a gay lesbian. I'm so confused, does that mean that he is a straight homosexual? Wait! Wait! What? I'm not a domestic terrorist! I like where this is going, just not here. Good idea, your Dad scares me. That just cause you scare him. My place. I have the best view of the entire city. Let's go. - Who are they? - They're nobody. Look who's back... with company. Morgan, this is Misty. Misty, Morgan. It's nice to meet you, Misty. Where did you find her? Church? Why church? I'm so sorry, how rude of me. I'm not used to him bringing girls home. You know? They're usually anorexic twinks. Nice to meet you, Morgan. Let's go. Hey, Morgan! Has he taken your wallet yet? Yeah, that's what swept me off my feet. I want my money tonight or you're out! : You live up here? Told you... Best view of the city. You impressed, yet? Where do you pee? I have four options. How do you poop? Why do you owe that girl money? Here we go again with the questions. Sorry, it's a bad habit. It's the detective in me. Well? I borrowed some money from her and haven't paid her back yet. It's no big deal. How much? Seriously? Was it for drugs? Wow. No, it was not for drugs. It was for, believe it or not, art school. You go to art school? I did... for about seven weeks, but it was a total scam. You wanna go inside? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Great, I just get dizzy sometimes. You afraid of heights? I love heights! Let's just go in your palace. Thanks. Is she your ex-girlfriend? She is, isn't she? For the next five minutes, no more questions. Just one more? OK. Ask your question. Don't you get lonely up here? Not really. That's a lie. Looking down, avoiding eye contact, tone changes. All signs of a big fat lie. I'm not lonely right now. I looked so different back then. Way back when you were innocent. Which brings us to today. Paging Doctor Colson at the E.R. Maybe we should explain why we have the doctor tied up in the closet. We don't want your family to get the wrong idea. Good thinking. Doctor, you should probably watch this too. Told you, it's stupid. Shut it. I'm reading. He was falling in love. Madly. But he knew, the queen bee would never allow them to be together. The dragonfly boy had an idea an idea so great, he was sure that the Queen bee would be fooled and the princess of bees would now be allowed to love him forever. He flew up to the cupboard, opened it and grabbed a jar of honey. I love it. You made this? You really like it? Yes. They're in love. It's just a story, not even a very good one. Love stories are the only stories worth telling. Why'd you quit art school? You're only good if you do it their way. If you play by their rules. My rebel! Are you the little dragonfly boy? No, you are. I'm the princess bee. I have to go. Thought you were staying the night. You lost the bet, remember? Good night, princess. Baby? You can't runaway from this. We need to talk about it. It's not easy for any of us. We just... We just want to do what's best for you. Then just act normal to me again? Okay. They're um, They're sending us to a specialist. Your results came in. It's... Your situation is-- What did they say? They're going to take you right away. In Houston. If they can fix me there, they can fix me here. They can't fix you here, baby. I'm sorry. But they can't. What's going on? Are you okay, Dad? Yeah, Buddy. It's okay. It's okay. Jordan? Detective Colossus. Inspector Clouseau! Dragonfly boy missed his princess bee already? Wait. I need to tell you something. You have a boyfriend? I don't care. I wasn't born with a jealous bone. Everybody was born with a jealous bone, but no. I don't have a boyfriend. I have something else. - Just listen to me. - I'm listening, what is it? I have a brain tumor! A brain tumor? Like what, a tumor in your brain? Yep. A brain tumor, a tumor in my brain. Does it hurt? Mmhmm. Is it serious? Yes. It is serious. Well can't a doctor like suck it out or do whatever it is that doctors do? No. It's in my brain. But, how? They found a lump here two years ago. They got out all the malignant cells but last year, we learned that it spread to my brain. It's... irreversible. Nothing's irreversible. I came to tell you that's why I gave you the wrong number. I still found you. And that I'm leaving tomorrow. Where are you going? Texas. They have to take over my situation. When are you coming back? I don't know. You don't look sick. Yeah. It's what's on the inside that counts. Wait! It can't be like this, just like that. Doesn't feel right. I know it doesn't. Wait! Just hear me out! OK? If it is irreversible, they can't do anything right? I can do that. So why go? For my family. They need this. Wait! Just, what? Just, just stop saying wait! I meant stay. Fuck. See that? You probably thought it was a couple of lunatics that kidnapped you. In reality, we're just two birds in love. Hey, you okay in there? Uh, just... Uh, just my... Morgan? Morgan! ♪ ...You're my best friend ♪ M-O-R-G-A-N ♪ When you went ♪ I crossed my heart ♪ Promised you ♪ To never be apart ♪ Cause you're my little girl you're my best friend. ♪ ♪ M-O-R-G-A-N The tumor in Morgan's brain is spreading very quickly. We ran numerous tests and right now we only have one option. Do it again with a wave of radiation and see if it reactions. We came here because you guys are the best. Tell me you can do something to help her. The chances of her recovery are very low. We'll continue to do everything we can. But this condition it never ends well. What we can do is make her transition as comfortable as possible. Eliminate most of the pain. But it's not going to be easy for her or her family. Y-you're tell me my daughter is going to die? When we get to a point where there is nothing more to be done, we recommend that you take her. Where she's home with her family. We should start radiation here as soon as possible. We'll make an incision, take some blood some tissues, some bone samples to gauge the affectivity of it now. May I begin the prep? What if I take her home today? What should we expect to see? More frequent headaches will emerge. Confusion, numbness, maybe some personality changes. Difficulty in speech and possibly seizures. We recommend you don't leave yet. Three months. You know, it doesn't really matter where that is. You start your prep and then we will just... If it doesn't work, we'll take her home. Of course. Three... Two... One... He shoots! He misses! But there's still a half-second on the clock, Bailey with the rebound Wha-pow-pow-pow! And the crowd goes wild! We're all set. You ready to go, my love? The dragonfly boy covered himself in honey. As he did this, the dragonflies above began to leave one by one. The dragonfly boy was now all alone. The dragonfly boy walked all day and all night, covered head to toe in honey. Many bees from the local village hives began to be attracted to his coat of honey. The bees would swarm to the dragonfly boy, sticking to the dragonfly boy's honey-glued body. Soon, covering the dragonfly boy entirely making him look no longer like a dragonfly, but now as a giant bee himself. He arrived at the Queen Bee's honeycombed castle and is approached by the royal bee guard. "May I help you?" "Yes, I am a prince bee from a far away kingdom" "I am here to offer my heart to the Princess Bee." "We will take you to the Queen" Hey, stranger. What are you doing? Just doodling. Why? It's like an orgy down there, everybody's so fucked out of their brains. Thought you were into that. Well it depends who's involved. You wanna go down there? - Come on. - I was just leaving. Don't be such a grouch. Have a drink. - Come on! - What are you on right now? Wine! God. Come on. How have you been? You'd know if you were around, but... You're always up here. Coloring or you know, running around with that church girl. I haven't seen her in a while. Did you rob her blind already? You don't know anything about her. Oh, Jordan. C'mon. Really? You know she can dress like us, she can act like us, but she will never be like us! I know that type. Yeah? Her parents bail her out... Right? Yeah, her life is so fucking easy. Like us? There is no "us". I'm nothing like you! Whoa! Leave, Misty! OK! Chill out, dude! Did I just, like, insult your fucking princess? You know, hey, have you noticed her? She has like some, um speech impediment, you know? She talks like this. Yeah, she sounds like a fucking retard! Get out! Why can't you just ever leave? No, you get out! You get the fuck out of my roof! - It's not your fucking roof. - No! Yeah! I don't give a shit! OK? You've always been a fucking loser. You quit, quit, quit! Quit, quit, quit, quit! That's what you do! That's the only thing you know what to do. OK? And she knows that. She pities you. She loves me. And I love her. Where's my money? I'm getting it. You're out, OK? I don't give a fuck about your stupid little shit drawings! All this fucking shit! I don't give a shit! Get the fuck out! I want my money tonight. If not... this whole thing's gonna go out. OK? You understand? Fuck you! They're taking me apart piece by piece, Mom. - When I die-- - No, don't say that. It's irreversible, mom. When it happens, it can't be here. Promise me it won't be here! They're doing everything that they can. I promise you that. Promise her it won't be here, Mom. Bailey! Morgan, I promise you I won't let anyone keep you here one second longer than you want to be, alright? Should we step outside? No, this is about me! I want to hear it! - They can't. - Take me home! I hear they can manage your pain much better than we can at home, baby. Take me home! Bailey? We're going home. No, Bailey! Just let us think. OK? Please, whatever time I have left. Let me have it. Why didn't my key work? Probably because Misty changed the locks. Why? To keep Jordan out. I'm Jordan. Not today princess. What are you talking about? So I take it that this is the hive, and I'm like one of the guardian bees. How big is my stinger? The dragonfly boy was led into the Queen's palace. She looked the dragonfly boy up and down and said "What hive are you from?" "I am a prince from a hive deep in the northern forest, so deep you probably never heard of it". "I am the queen! I heard of every hive worth hearing about! Tell me, young prince. Is your land rich in honey?" "Yes, My hive is full of honey." The queen's eyes light up with a greedy golden glow. "Then I will be twice as rich! Bring out the princess!" The bee guards open a honeycombed door. There stands the beautiful princess bee. Her eyes meet the dragonfly boy's eyes. "You are the strangest bee I have ever seen, but I can see in your eyes, that you are a kind prince." The dragonfly boy, more happy than he has ever been, embraces his beloved princess bee. And even though it was quite romantic, the dragonfly boy knew he had just fallen into a very sticky situation. The princess bee became stuck to the dragonfly boy just like all the other bees before her. The queen bee was outraged! What are you doing? Go back to sleep. Brings out your eyes. What the hell are you doing here? Morgan, is everything okay? Yeah, it's just a spider. I captured it! Okay, I'll be downstairs if you need me. I'm fine, Mom! I missed you. We can't do this. It's not fair. Life's not fair. It's not good for you. And it's not good for me. I'm not good for anyone. How does that matter? I like you. That's how it matters. I don't want you to see me like this. Are you kidding? I like this new look. It's very anarchist. It's sexy. No. I mean... I don't want you to see what happens to me. I want you to remember me when I was me. I'm falling apart. We're all falling apart, Morgan. It's the nature of this world. Please, just go away. I am going away. I just came here to see if you wanted to come with. You can't just run from what's coming to me. You can always run. It may catch you, but we can always run. Make that fucker chase you down, instead of just rolling over waiting for it. You don't get it. Please, leave. And don't come back. We won't recognize each other if you do. I'm not leaving you. I don't want you here! Do you get that? I don't want to know you anymore. Leave or I'll scream. - You're not dead yet, Morgan. - I am dead. Your story ends with "She dies, the end." Trust me!

Hey, hey, hey! Come here! Come here! Where's my money? Jordan, just give them the money! - Come out and play! - No! No! Aah! - No! No, no! - Listen to me. Listen. I think you're confused. I'm not some pinché puto selling pastelitos on the street, man. I'm a business man. Yeah. And you interfered with my business. Now, I have to call my friend. This one here. Say you don't have the money. Say it. Say "I don't have the money". - Say it. Say it! Say it! - Wait, wait! I don't! - I don't have all of it! - Say it! I just only have part of it.

You understand? What the hell is going on here? None of your business. This is my business. Oh, and this is my gun! Listen man, We caught this piece of shit stealing purses from your club. We were doing your job. I don't like doing your job. I got my own job! That doesn't make me happy! Not happy about that! Misty? You have your purse? Hey! Grab yours? Vamanos! Vamos! Adios. Keep walking. Don't come back here. Just wondering when you'd be coming back for those. You knew these were under your bed? Took me less than five minutes to find them. What happened to your face? Someone broke my heart and it spread to my face. I missed you. I missed you too. I missed you too. Follow me. Wait! What are you doing? I want to be with you. I want to live with you. I want to look like you. Everything. You can't, I'm... I don't care how much time we have together. Dragonflies only live for three months and look how happy they are. How do you know they're happy? Have you ever heard of a depressed dragonfly? No. Are you sure about this? This might be a very stupid idea. Let's just be stupid.

Shut up! Tell them all I'll be right down. Mom wants to know if your guest will be staying for breakfast. Tell your Mom and Dad that I'm starving. This is gonna be interesting. - Hey Bailey? - Yeah? What do you think of my new look? You two look like a couple of badass GI Janes. Ooh Rah! Hey Morgan, I need to leave town for a bit. Haven't we been down this road already? We stay off the roads. We have wings. Let's use them. Come with me. I'm not a dragonfly, Jordan. Look. I know it sucks that your brain is sick. And fuck God or life or whatever, whoever it is that did this to you. But it doesn't have to be miserable. We can do anything we ever wanted to right now. Like what? What can I do? You wanna travel, we can. You wanna go skydiving, we can. Steal a car, rob a bank. Swim with a turtle. I don't care what the plan is. We don't have to wait. We have money and time, let's spend them both together. I've always imagined that one day I'd be wearing a white vintage dress, my hair would be up, and my family would all be crying, off to the side, with flowers everywhere. Now my hair is gone and my family will cry for a different reason Morgan Gandara, my dragonfly boy, will you marry me? My brain could just stop working. I can die tomorrow, we all can. There's no line to wait in. It just happens. You're serious, aren't you? Try to answer me by asking another question. Yes? So, Jordan, that looks like it was a pretty nasty fall. Thirty-seven steps, hit every one. Must've really pissed off the staircase. Dennis and I were saying how much we liked your new haircut. No, I never said anything like that. Mom, I'm quitting piano. It's getting too difficult. Okay. I'll call Mrs. Randall today. Jordan, I didn't hear you come in last night. Did you knock or just creep up the back steps? - I let him in, Dad. - What time was that? I thought you retired from being a detective? We're getting married. Huh? Just like that, huh? Wow, this is awesome. We're in love. Under different circumstances, the way I would approach this would be to ask the both of you first but we're running against the clock here. Moe... You hardly know this boy. How long did you know Mom before you guys got married? That's a completely different story. It is and it isn't. When'd you plan on having this wedding? And where? Right here. Tomorrow? This is insane. I think it's a great idea. Morgan? This is what you want? This is all I have ever wanted. My sister is ordained. Yes! Aunt Lisa can marry us! Dennis? Congratulations. Score! I'm gonna have two sisters! Uh, hey Dad... - Do you think I can borrow-- - Already? Seriously? Unless you have two vintage wedding dresses hanging in the closet. I have one.

Am I ruining your honeymoon by being a critically conditioned wife? I think most mornings after the wedding, the bride is usually gripping the toilet. Promise? Usually large amounts of alcohol are involved But as long as you end up in the same place it doesn't really matter how you get there. I guess so. I just feel so foggy. You should shit in the bed before we leave. I'm not shitting in the bed.

She ordered her royal bumblebee guards to strip the honey-glued bees off of the dragonfly boy. One by one, they were pulled off his body until standing there, he was just the dragonfly boy. "How dare you try to fool me!" The Queen bee shouted. "Off with his head!" The guards pulled out their stingers and approached the dragonfly boy. They don't kill him, do they? "He's beautiful!" "Look how colorful his wings are!" The princess bee approaches the dragonfly boy. "What are you?" The princess bee asks. "What do you mean, what am I?" "Are you a dragonfly?" "Yes" The princess bee examines his wings, his body, and his eyes. "I've never seen anything so beautiful before." "A bee, bee-longs with a bee!" "Says who?" "Says me! I am the queen!" The royal bumble bee guards, armed with their sharp stingers begin to march toward the two lovers. "Are dragonflies fast?" "Yes, much faster than bees" And at that very moment, the princess bee hops onto the dragonfly boy, holds him tightly, and says "Let's flyaway together" He flutters his wings rapidly as they lift off the ground, and just like that, the two lovers race across through the air and out of the Queen's Bee's castle. What happens next? That's up to us. I love it. They should get married. I love you. I wish that I can be your dragonfly boy forever. I wish we had time more. We had more time. The hell with time. It's not real anyway. What's real is you and me. Right here. You're my fantasy Which makes you my reality You're my realistic fantasy. And you're my fantastic reality. Fuck time. Janet? Honey? - Come here. - I am... I am... You're what? I am her mother! And I am so tired! I'm so tired! - I am her mother! - And I am her father. I just, you know what I... I mean, I can't, I can't I can't, I can't. I can't! - What can't you do? What? - I can't stop. I can't stop fighting.

Take me! Don't take my little girl! - Is that what you want me to-- - Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Oh my god! No... I can't stop fighting. Do you remember her fifth birthday? She just wanted a brother. Hm, you remember that? Didn't want a pony, no bike. No, no dolls. Just a brother. She was such a smart little five year old. She wanted a brother because As she grew up She didn't want us to be lonely. Oh, Dennis... I can't live without my little girl. - I can't live without-- - You have to. You have to. I just wanna put her back inside me. - I know, I know. I can start all over again. Put her back inside me. You're almost done fighting. Beautiful, isn't it? The most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Let's do something I've never done before. Something bad. I'm always good. What's bad but not cruel? Can you run? I can't. I can woddle. Woddle. What's woddle? You know, limp away at a medium pace. Like a penguin. Okay, here's the plan. You're going to be my lookout, got it? Crap that! We go in together or not at all. Crap that? Fine. But just stick close to me and yell whatever Spanish words you know, okay? Si. What's this for? That is your gun. Don't worry, it's not loaded. - C'mon! - OK. Hello, welcome. Gimme all the money in the register, cabron! We're outlaw bandits with nothing to lose, grandpa! - Spanish. - Oh. Hola, amigo. Señor bandits! Don't try anything stupid, old man. Yeah because where we are from, we don't take prisoners. And we leave no witnesses! Except for this time, with you. Oh, I messed that up didn't I? No, you were great. He probably pissed his pants. Seriously? Yeah. He hit the silent alarm, let's go. Damn coppers! Gracias, mi amigo! Come here! Much faster! Stay down! That was so bad. We're like wanted fugitives now! You called us outlaw bandits?

But I like pain now. How does it look? It looks just like you. How does it look? It looks just like you. I like your smile. ♪ Zombie Apocalypse, yeah!♪♪ You know, you really shouldn't be driving. I do things I shouldn't do now. What's wrong? I can't, um. Put it in D. - I can't. - You sure you are okay to drive? - I don't, can't promise I... - Morgan, your hands. - I promise I... - Morgan, are you alright? Morgan! Morgan! Morgan! It's okay! Morgan! Come on! It's okay! Morgan. Morgan! Is this seriously the first time you've seen a horror movie? Shut up! He's about to get slaughtered! How are you not scared? I'm a rebel. I'm not scared of anything anymore. I know what I want to do tomorrow. What's that? See Mom. Want to go home tomorrow? Not my home, not my Mom. I haven't been here in 13 years. That's my favorite number. Fred? It's me. Who's me? Your son. I, I just didn't hear. That's all. I know you're my son. - Hi Mom. - Hey. Uh, this is Morgan. My wife. You got a wife. It's, it's nice to meet you. What should I call you? Alice. No, call me uh, Momma. He, he used to always call me Mom. Uh, Morgan and I were on our honeymoon And she, she wanted to meet you. Hey, who's Fred? Oh never mind Fred. I just want to look at you. Okay. You look so much like your father. How would you know that? I hope you're nothing like him. His Daddy was a thief. Mom, my Dad was a Chief. Yeah he was a Chief, alright. Chief talking bull. Who drew those? He did them all. Jordy was artistic. They're wonderful. Oh, never mind the pictures. Hey you all must be starving. I swear, the moment I saw you walk in I thought the both of you were a couple of strays begging for scraps. We get a lot of strays around here. Mostly cats and dogs, but I defeated a coyote not too long back. Must've been hit by a car. Up on the highway. Well, we're not a couple of strays. But we're a couple of hungry rebels. There you go, Ted the Turtle. I got some chicken in the foot. Chicken in the foot? Don't ask. I call the fridge the foot. Remember why, Jordy? Nope. You sassy, boy. When you, when he was a little kid, he'd point to the fridge and say foot. M-meaning food. "Mama, foot!" Doctors thought he had a speech impediment, but he showed them! - Didn't you, Jordy? - Yup. That's cute. It's cold, but I like it cold. Jordy always ate it cold. You want me to heat it up? Oh, no. Cold feet is fine. I'm just so happy. I can't tell you. Knowing that he's finally doing something. - He's getting married. - Mom, please. Oh don't be such a girl. Had to make sure that, you were a girl. Mom. Oh come on, Jordy! We had quite the scare when he was a child. Playing all by himself with dolls like a little girl. Drawing these pretty pictures and all, and the other boys are playing sports, and fighting but Jordy, no He was inside, hiding In my clothes sometimes. Then in school getting kicked out for messing around with, Oh! With another boy. And I knew it was just kids and their wonderin's after they beat him half to death and back, I told him to take off, and he did. Now look at him, he's all grown up like a man. I still play with dolls. I still wear women's clothing when I want to. Jordan. It's okay. I just wanted to see where the princess bee came from. We can go. Jordy, you can't be a pansy and have a wife. I mean, God ain't fooled. She maybe, but God isn't. It was nice to meet you, Alice. The queen bee. Queen bee? I like that. Mom, here. Here's a... I'll get you something. After all it was y'all that got married, not me. Woo hoo! A knife? Yes, It's a letter opener. I won it at Hoolie Hoop stop last week. Probably cheap, but I got no use for it. Nobody writes me any mail. Thanks, Mom. I love you. I love you, you know that. This life bit and stuck on me, but it didn't get you. You were too quick. My boy was born with wings. You're the exact hybrid of your mom and dad. I can see them both in your face Yup. My parents are knockouts. I can see your Mom in your face, in a certain kind of light. My Mom and I both have exotic birds faces. - She's more of the Cuckoo bird and I'm more of a-- - Peacock? Stay here. Right here, with me. Forever should be much longer, Morgan.

If I untie you, will you help her? Will you help her?! - This girl needs a hospital. - No hospitals! She's going to die. I know. Why do you think we kidnapped you? We need to do it now. Do what, exactly? I want you to open us up, put her heart in my chest and mine in hers. Are you insane? That would kill you both! Do it or I kill you! It's all we want. Yes, is this the front desk? I need an ambulance. No! No! Just call an ambulance, I got two people here with injuries, One's a possible stroke, the other has a puncture wound to the abdomen. Hurry! This is a letter opener!

Yeah, yeah. Where's Morgan? Um, she's here. But, um she can't uh... What do you mean? Morgan... She can't even talk anymore, man. She can hardly move. She doesn't even remember who I am. Morgan! Aah! Morgan, Morgan? Excuse me, sir, are you okay? Morgan? Morgan! Sir! Security. Call security! Jordan, Jordan! It's okay! I'm getting you out of here, Morgan. I'm sorry. I'm her wife! I'm her wife! It's okay, I'm gonna get you out of here. Get off of me! Morgan, it's gonna be okay. - Jordan, it's okay. Stop. - Fuck! Morgan! How was she? Before? Was she? Scared? She was happy. She recorded most of it for you. She was happy. I, I need to get her out of here. No, she can't move. Her brain is shutting down. Morgan's going to heaven, Jordan. She can't die in here. I promised her. - There's nothing more we can do. -: Yes, there is. You know what she'd want. We have to do this for her. Please. She needs to be outside so she can fly. When I quit school, I figured I'd just fall back into using again, but something inside me told me to stay clean. I felt like something important was coming and I wanted to be awake to see it. Then I saw you. Jordan. It's irreversible. So is this. Tell me what to do! Please tell me what to do. What do you want to do next? You want to rob a bank? Go out in a hail of bullets? You need to know how it ends, don't you? So, the dragonfly boy and his princess bee flew as fast as they could away from the kingdom. "Where are we going?" Asked the Princess bee. "Wherever we want" said the dragonfly boy. So they went anywhere and everywhere together. Through lush fields, deep valleys, thick jungle, deserts, waterfalls and even cities, they went everywhere together. But soon enough, word spread that the queen and her army of bees were searching for them all over the world and if caught, they would surely be killed. "Where can we hide? We've been everywhere together" said the dragonfly boy sadly. The princess bee replied "I have an idea. We can get married." It was your idea, remember? So they got married, in the backyard of a beautiful home. "Now, the queen will never find us!" Said the princess bee. "Even though we are married, the Queen and her army will search for us all over the world and one day she will find us" said the dragonfly boy. The princess bee smiled and happily said "But now we're married, and after the wedding comes a "honey moon". She can search everywhere on earth for us, but she'll never find us. So the dragonfly boy and her princess bee began to fly high into the sky toward the honey moon. They flew so far up that they left this world and could be seen no more. Morgan?
