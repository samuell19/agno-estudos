I should have predicted that actually. The women who interest in the sociology are totally different than the others. Maybe It's because They look at the world from a wide angle. They are not focus on anybody too much. They have this seriousness which scares people. You are making that all up, aren't you? They see all the tricks. After a short observation, They can understand What is real and What is fake. And After all those observations... They get these beautiful eyes which looks deep. Excuse me! Sorry! Yes sir! Yes, sir! I spoke with women predominantly, That was my choice Yes, But all in all We can say that The approach was from the perspective of gender. I don't think They tackle this issue enough in Turkey.

And I will keep my promises, I'm the number 1 in my class how many years now. I'm still inconsistent about going abroad. Don't dramatize it, please! It's because of your mother! You got a scholarship from 2 different schools, what else do you have to think about? Please, Don't involve me in to this! She will deside byherself. Filiz, What are you doing?

The life in here is real! Those people are real too. This is not only 2 credits to get for me. This place has a real meaning to me. Abusing this for a cheap movie cliche is not Romantic or funny.

Congratulations! I can't believe it! What kind of man are you? Look! They got a cake! Oh guys Why bothered yourselves? I told them to do this, It's a tradition. In this community! They do this If you get full marks of this lesson without a model and graduate. I just made that up, I had started a tradition today. Thanks to you! I wish This is gonna be an example for all of you. Baris! You didn't make that model? It's because You wanted to help me with my project, right? I lied to my family for the first time today. _ I'm Burcu now and this is Burcu's house, Is that it? _ don't make fun of me. It's really a strange feeling. _ And You didn't say that you work in that cafe _ That doesn't count!

You are overrating it a little bit, don't you think? I don't think They want to lose a student like you, I am sure They will give you one more chance. Don't be so sure! Everything is ruined. You ruined everything! Efsun, What are you talking about? You maybe take care of anything really easy, But I can't! I gotta work hard. It's always like that! You turned my life upside-down, Can't you see? You are harming me. Good bye! You are not coming? What's wrong? Nothing! He just didn't sleep yet. He is beating the drums like insane. As far as I know He is playing it 10 hours straight. Tarik! He is not sleeping for days, Are you aware of that? It will be over soon sweety! He will get a grip on himself. _ Tarik! Should I talk to this girl, huh? _ Don't! - Just Don't! Don't interfere! Leave her alone! What's up? Who da fuck are you? Let go of me! I'm gonna fuck you up! Are you ok? Baris Abi! That Guy is waiting for you with a couple of men out there. I'm begging you Don't mess with them. We called a cab for you to the rear exit. Thank you! Abi, Stop right here! The cake is in the oven. You want some too? Sure! It wasn't sweeten up for me to be with Baris He throwed off my balance. I lived my whole life by knowing what I want. I didn't learn the otherwise. I just can't gather myself up. I don't know why. Mom, What am I gonna do? Calm down, Honey! Just calm down! You are in Love, There is nothing to be afraid of. Take a deep breath! Tell him you are sorry! He is dying to forgive you right now. Mom, I am not used to this order. What order You talking about? This is Love! This is Love! If you get used to it, then You can't call it Love now can you? I can't sleep. I can't think anything else. I am all goofy, Is it normal? Forget about normal! Normal is not enjoyable. Let me tell you something. You analyze things over too much. Let yourself go! Listen to your heart. Squelch your mind! _ What happened? _ Your granny (R.I.P) had this saying... I just remembered that. Mind, Mind my ass! My beatiful daughter! I wish We could manage everything with mind, but.... My butterfly is half missing. My dear daughter! Shell I give you a secret? _ Mom? _ Take it easy honey. I... I loved your father very much. But If I could get back to your age.... I would wait for love. Maybe I wouldn't be happy like I'm right now... Maybe I wouldn't have you and your sister eather, But.... I would be someone else. I would be a woman who is much more related to myself. Fusun! Go after your love, my daughter. Maybe You won't be happy as much as I do.... But You will suit to your heart. I am so scared, Mom! Ofcourse You are. That's what we call love. Who ever is not scared is probably stupid. You knocked some sense into my mind. Not mind, not mind. Get going! You'll be late. Thank you Mom! Go on! What's wrong with this girl? I see odd customs and tattoos lately. Everything is just fine. Everything is cool. Come on, You never out of words. Where is this? Filiz! What happened? _ Fusun! _ What happened Filiz? Mom! My mom! my mom! ENOUGH! Onur? You not answering my calls. Well, I didn't know How to reach you. DAD! Honey! Dad! We aren't hugging eachother for a long time. Forgive me my daughter! I am so sorry! Where is Fusun? I will never leave you alone, I'll be always with you. My mom! Her heart had stopped. I'm your mom from now on, my dearling! Nowww, right here! There is something I wanna tell you. I always wanna be with you. What ever you want... What ever your plans for your life is, Just let me cut in! Let me be right next to you. Where ever you go, I go. No matter which path you take, Let me be your fellow traveller. You call me ''Deli Bal''(andromedotoxine), right? Let me make you high time to time. I can make you feel dizzy. Let me beautify your life and path. One of my teacher said once.... ''How much you take a risk of life, That much life you live''. It goes for Love too. I know! I take the risk of this Love totally. I aspire whole your life! ONLY YOU! WOULD YOU MARRY ME? Yes? Yes! Yes, my love! NO! Where on earth did this come from now? Like Country girls! Marriage? on your age? What about the schools which give you scholarship? Your sayings about You were gonna do academic career? You don't know How hard I worked to make you take your education. No way! No way, no way Fusun! I won't allow that. Not now, Not when We are so close to the end! I've got my own life. I'm not a child. I lived my whole life without thinking What I really want or not. I'll pay attention to my mom's will from now on. I'll listen to the voice of my heart. The voice of your heart? Yes Dad! I'll listen to the voice of my heart. I'm not sure If I will be like the women who you admire.... But, I'll get married with Baris. Ok then! It's your call! Have it your way! But Don't expect me to accompany you on this journey. Count me out! Oh my dear! You are so beautiful! But, It would be much better If you enjoy it. It sticks in my throat, Filiz! Don't take him seriously! You know my Dad. He'll give up being stubborn eventually. I wish Mom would be here. Think about She watches you, huh? from the sky, above the clouds. She would want you to be happy. You are right. But, I can't help it. Now, Look at that hideous ! He was probably spying on us. Miss Fusun Sahin! would you agree to marry mr. Baris Ayaz? YES! And, You guys are witnesses? _ YEs! _ Yes! Ladies and gentlemen! And I, pronounce this young couple 'man and wife'. This song for my beautiful wife. She won't be able to listen to it, If She didn't marry me. Honey? Are you ok, honey? Are you cold? I think She is sleepless. Fusun! Why don't you take a rest, huh? I just can't sleep. Come on! You have just woken up before me again. I just don't wanna miss to see you waking up. You are like a baby when you wake up. It's like waiting for the sun rise to me. _ Who is it? _ It's me! Forgot the keys? Oh man! Who is this guy? When I saw it, I just bought it. It's for you! But You gonna take care of it. Oh dear Look! This is philadelphus. Don't insist! It's not possible, You are wrong. First of all, Philadelphus has four leafs It's probably a Dog Rose at the furthest. Sweety! We got the same rose at the island. I planted it with my father. You know that too, I know this very well. Come on! You can't know that better then me now! My father is an agricultural engineer. But I am not sure If I am still his daughter. Well! I am coming! What's up? What are you doing, son? What on earth you doing?

Has Baris done these kinda things before? I mean disappearance or anything. He used to go to Island time to time. But not like this. Weren't They happy? We better take care of the budget, the amount You ask for is too much. _ There are Half a dozen firms that can do this for half of this amount. _ Yes, But ahh... IF SO, BRING IT TO THEM! Even They can build a chicken coop in the garden for a gift. Have a economical day! Why did you do that? I don't know! I just couldn't contain myself. Ohh my God! I fucked that up, didn't I? I fucked that up! She must be awake, Let me check on her. Fusun! Hello! No way! How can I forget? You- don't worry about that. Fusun! Did I just leave you under the sun? did you get parched?

I was afraid to ask this question but.. I can't take it anymore. Is there someone else? Come on! Come on! Come on! Ohh man! Shit! Bravo! Thanks God - Abi! You seem happy now after a long time. It's because of the..... Drugs! Drugs that Doc gave me - just turn me into another person. My own wife can't even recognize me anymore. She even started to ask me If there is someone else in my life. It's like I was not there. I was someone else. I was just sitting there like a vase all day. I left Fusun alone. In fact I promissed her that .. I would never leave her alone. I took the drug other day... I am fine man! Don't worry about me. Like old days. Everything is gonna be alright. Abi! Why don't you tell 'Fusun Abla' about all these? Look at me Haydar! I rather to die than upsetting her. You hear me? I die! I've been so stupid. Abla I believed him. How should I know? maybe It worked for me that way. He didn't share it with me. He didn't tell me anything. Am I not his immediate family? It's because He didn't want to scare you. He was afraid to hurt you. After a couple of drinks He starts to complain about things. He used to say He gotta protect you from himself. He said He would rather to die than to hurt even your strand. Why is He doing this to me now? My dear Fusun! Please, Come onn! Well Baris I am really exhausted. I'm drained. I've been dreaming all day to come home and cross my legs. I'm not gonna tire you, I will fly you there and fly you back. Your life become work.

I love you whole world. You know We read that book 'the little prince' You got angry When I said I was that fox in the book, remember? Yes, I am that fox. You tamed me with your love. I become not able to go away anymore. You taught me to wait, You taught me to love in your way. Fusun! You re-created me. I love you more than anything on this world. more than life itself. But I am ...... wounded, my darling! My strength is not enough for myself. My strength is not enough to protect you from myself. I was on the road to make you happy yesterday. When I was flying I broke your wings. I.... don't know happiness, Fusun! I realized that when I saw the fear in your eyes. I feel like a worm who loves the rose but eats the leaves at the same time. I'm going far away sweetheart. To Somewhere that my love can't hurt you. To somewhere I will be able to love you without harming you. And You know you call me DELIBAL, (ANDROMEDOTOXINE) Too much of it is poison, My dear Fusun! DELIBAL is poison! You gave me a long love. I am so happy when I am about to leave. You- be happy too! And forgive me! If It's not now, One day! Kisses alot that you can't count. Kisses much about the stars. No! ANDROMEDOTOXINE
