Xiang, look at this. Is there a problem, Jet? Yeah. This is broken. See right here? Its time to get a new wheel. Sure. You know what that will cost? I spent half my combat pay getting this thing up and running. I tell you what. Down in the yard, they sell used parts. Yeah? Why dont you run down there and buy some spokes? All right. Hey, Xiang, you hungry? No. See you later. Oh, no. Hands to yourself. What? What am I paying for then? Where are you going, Miss? Later. Just take it easy. Come on, baby. I wont bite. Hey!

He doesnt know this, but I paid for his rickshaw services anonymously. Errands and such. I know hes not well and could use the money, so... You know, I could drive you instead. All right. Take me to Yuchan Road. Yeah. [Horn honking] No, no. Its very sweet, huh? Hey, have you seen Uncle Wong? Not lately. Why? Ive got something for him here.

Its around the block. Hey! Whats the hurry? Why dont you come to the bar anymore? You scared of us or what, huh? Yeah! Hey, youre a pretty good fighter. - Why dont you fight me? - Nah, hes scared. - He just got lucky last night. - Try to hold on. [Laughing] Get running, boy! Whats the matter? You dont want to fight now? [Laughter] Where are you going? Go on! Go on! Get his ass! Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up! Hurry up! Whoo! The other way, the other way, the other way! [Moaning] Are you all right? Hold on! [Horn honking] There he is! Hey! Just go! Go, go, go! [Breathing heavily] Okay. Here we are. Careful. Yao will be here soon.

Hey! - Youre almost there! Whoo! - [Crash] - Oops! Sorry! Sorry! [Laughter] Hey! Are you looking for trouble? - Sorry. - Get out of here! Clean it properly! This is dirty. - Sam. - Ah, how are you? Have you seen those sailors from the other day? Which ones? That Yankee I fought with in the ring. Tell me whats going on. Those bastards took Mr. Xiangs rickshaw when I wasnt looking and completely destroyed it! No! How am I supposed to tell Mr. Xiang? Hmm. [Rustling] Just come with me. [Slow jazz music plays, laughter] You need a drink. Two beers, huh? Sit down. Why dont you go and buy him a new one? Take this. But I cant. Yes, you can. Its not that much, and this place wont miss it. Get Mr. Xiang some new wheels. But I... Listen to me. I respect you. You know that. Well just call this a loan, then. Hey, Sam, why dont you just let me work? - That way... - No. Take the money. Hey, come on. Isnt there some kind of work? Afraid not. I dont want it. Hmm. Since you insist... How bout... Well, there is something. You wont last long. So tell me, all right? The Yank sailors need a sparring partner for just a day or two. So, if youre really interested... Sparring partner? Yeah. See? The guy getting his brains beat in. Thank you. Sounds like its right up my alley. So, when do you need me? You cant fight back. Dont worry about it. You know what? You got your guy. All right. So, when do I start? You can start right now if you want to. - Okay? - Yeah. Go on. Get tough! Come on! Get mean, Bailey! That Bailey bastard! Youre going to pay for that rickshaw! - Move out of the way. - Right now! [Both grunting, crowd cheering] Whats going on? Hes supposed to be my sparring partner, right, Sam? I told you, now. Sparring partners do not throw punches. Im warning you now. He stole the rickshaw! Ugh! No. Wait! Stop fighting! If you dont stop fighting... - Stop fighting back! - Dont fight back! Well, I quit. No. You cant quit. Its way too late now. The American sailors are going to take it out on me. Just dont go quitting right now. You know, we had a deal. You asked for work, and I gave you work. You have to keep up your end of the bargain, or theyll tear my place apart and me along with it. Please. No. Please dont do this. Remember, you gave me your word. Go right! Right, right, right, right! Right, right, right, right! Stop fighting! Come on. Hit me. Hit me again. - Thats it, thats it! Come on! - Okay. Thats enough. - All right, Bailey! - All right! - Whoo-hoo! - Youre some sparring partner. You kicked ass. Thats what Im talking about. Ha ha! [Moaning] Hey, Jet, look at me. How bad are you hurt? Im really sorry about all this. Hey, you dont have to come tomorrow. But I... gave you... my word. Sam! Oh! Thank you. Heres the money. - Will he come tomorrow? - Oh, yes. He promised. - You sure? - Of course. Good. Good work, Sam. All right, III see you tomorrow. Thank you, yes. [Knock on door] Who is it? Its me. Na. Oh. Hello. Come in. Please. Okay. Am I disturbing you? Not really. I just had to see you. I wanted to ask... Are you going to spar here again? Yes. I said I would, so I will. Anyway, Sam already paid me. Hes looking out for me, right? Hes just a puppet for Bailey. Sams not on your side. He set you up. Sam? They wanted you to act as his sparring partner. They made the plans yesterday. Well... I have my own plan now. - Oh, yeah. Hows that? - You were unstoppable, Bailey. Heres my left jab. Hey, come on, now. You want some? Come on! That guy never knew what hit him. He didnt know whether he was coming or going. Captain, what did you hit me for? You son of a bitch. You want to fight this guy, lets see you fight him like a man. No, Jet. Cant you just let it go? No. Not until I teach all of them a lesson. Hey, young man, good to see you. You showed up just in time, huh? Quit playing games! When Im finished with them, Im coming for you. What are you talking about? Im with you, huh? - Look, Bailey, theres the man. - Right on time. You look all right, but I dont think you can handle the heat. Come here! All right, now my rules. - Tell him. - Are you ready? What rules? Im not fighting you. Youre fighting him. - You remember me, huh, boy? - [Thunder crashes] Youre fighting me, not Bailey. Im not going to do it. Uh-huh. He didnt come here today to fight with you. Bailey disgraced his uniform, and I wont stand for that. Youre a good fighter. Lets see if you can do the same to me. The fights over when one of us doesnt get up. I plan on kicking your ass, and I never lose. Hey, you dont have to fight him, you know. He wants to kill you. Dont do it, Jet. [Thunder crashes] You dont want to fight? That would make you a punk, right? So, what do you say? Well, are you in? The only punk would be you. Hmm. Prove it. Im in. [Cracking] [Cracking] Okay, here we go. Check this out. Ladies and gentlemen, representing the United States Navy, the U.S. Armed forces heavyweight champion, undefeated in 41 fights. - Captain Hayes! - [Cheering] Come on and show him our support as he goes one-on-one with the foreign devil from China.

The U.S. Navy boys and the locals. Please hurry! Screw you! - Are you talking to me? - Yeah, you, you monkey. Stop! No more, please! Youre wrecking my bar! Please stop it! All of you, freeze! All right, break it up! Break it up! Get back! Get back! You, get over here! Knock it off! Come on, you! Its Na. Lets go. Come on! Come on! Its a tragedy. Its such a tragedy. [Both grunting] [Both breathing heavily] Youll pay. Oh. My rickshaw. Youll pay. Youll pay for Xiangs rickshaw! Youll pay for it! III make you pay. Ill get you. Ill make you pay for that. Ill make you pay. Your bill is settled. You can go. Mr. Xiang? Oh. Oh, yes. Thank you. NA: Thank you for taking such good care of him, Doctor. [Gasps] Hey, have you seen Yong Jet? Not lately. I have, uh... Jets been hurt in a fight. I took him to my house. Is that you, Jet? Xiang! Xiang, are you all right? Yeah, Im all right. What happened? It began when I took Yaos wife to the hospital, and they jumped me. Those Yankees broke your rickshaw, and now theyre gonna pay. Its just a rickshaw. Forget about it. Its you that matter, not the rickshaw. Were going home. [Gasps] Why? Oh! Xiang, whyd you do that? Shes a whore! Thats why! Come on! Hey, let go! Im staying! What are you doing, Xiang? Stop it! [Grunting] Xiang, stop. This is embarrassing. Whats wrong with you, anyway? Are you crazy? XIANG: What were you doing in that filthy whorehouse? JET: What are you talking about? You know what Im talking about. Will you stop acting crazy? Damn it! Just settle down. Hey, look, you had no reason to hit her. She saved my life. You should be grateful. But instead, you hit her. Why, Xiang? Tell me why. Why did you hit her? Because shes my daughter. And so what? Shes your daughter. Oh, now I see. Xiang... Dont you remember? You told me on the island. You said you survived that battle because you wanted to see your daughter again. - Go! - Wait! Hold it! But when I asked you about her... you said that she was dead! I believed it. Xiang, how could you? Cant you please go away? Shes still human, or did you forget? She might be a whore. Still that changes nothing. Shes still your daughter! All right. Thats it. Tell everybody! You all hear that? My daughter is a filthy whore! Why dont you just tell the whole world? Hmm. Whats the difference? Shes always going to be your daughter. Xiang, why are you doing this to her? You ought to be... Youre acting just like... Just like an old... Like an old what? Like an old fool. Thats what. All right, get out! You hear me? Get out! Go! Here, take your things and dont ever come back! Oh, well, then, you want me to stay away, I will. Permanently! [People giggling] Come here, sweetheart! Come to me! - Hey, Im gonna get you! - [Giggling] [Laughing] Youre such a big girl. Oh! [Laughing] My father. He used to love the beach. I... We used to be so happy. So close. My father and I. Oh, dad really loved me. He did, huh? It must hurt. Seeing me as a prostitute. So much has changed. First, Mama died. And then the war. If only things were different. There has to be a way to make him change his mind. Xiang, are you in here? Hey. Hi. Xiang, I want to talk to you. Eh? What is there to talk about? Hey, just because you threw me out doesnt mean I cant come back here. Anyway... Listen. I need your advice. You want my advice? The hell you do. Im in love, you see, with this woman. You cant be. Yeah, and youre responsible. If you didnt throw me out, we wouldnt be together. But you did. Its pretty crazy, huh? You brought us together. So, in a way... So, in a way, you owe me. Hey, you know what? Shes a real beauty, I tell you. Shes got eyes the size of this bowl. And long legs and breasts like this. And a little nose. A little nose like this. [Chuckles] You just ate her nose. And her rear end. Ooooh! Sweet, just the way I like it. But... Whats the matter? Shes a hooker. Oh. You see, she didnt want to do it. She was a student, but because of the war, she was forced into it. You know what? She says shes quitting. Its good shes quitting. Because no one really wants to be... Wants to be a whore. Quitting is the only right thing for her to do. Give her a chance, Jet. That girl has courage. Yeah, she deserves a chance, right? So, when can I introduce you to her? Whenever you like. Shes right here, waiting outside. Hey, Xiang. Look. What? What are you doing here? Get out! - Hey, no! - Get out! Whoa! Stop it! Stop it, Xiang! What are you doing? Get her out of here! [Crying] Dont go! Xiang, have you forgotten what you said? Why not give her a new opportunity? Just because shes your daughter? Why is it so hard for you to see? Do you think that she really wanted to do this? Come on, Xiang. Why cant you just forgive her? Is it because youre too damn stubborn? [Grunts] Papa! Oh, Papa! [Na crying] XIANG: Jet? I hear you, Xiang. Its all right now. Why dont we sit down and eat? Well, I made such a mess. Yeah, but you missed the table. Let me straighten up. Papa... I could go get some more food and wine. Yes, go ahead. Ah, wait. The best wine. Of course. I know which one. How can I help you, Miss? A roasted chicken and two bottles of shao wine. - Right away. - Thank you. [Tires screech] MAN: Hey, come here, baby! [Gasps] Hey! What are you doing? - You coming with us! - Let me go! - I got her. - Whats going on there? Hey, leave her alone!

Learn how to drive, will you? Hey! There she goes! Get after her! Come on! Damn it! [Both panting] Hey! This way! Over here! Come on! [Panting] [Engine revving] No! [Brakes squeal] Aaah! [Panting] There she is! Right behind you, baby! Come on! There you are. What are you scared of, huh? Afraid I might hurt you? Hey, what are you doing on the ground? - Get up! - Get up! What do you think youre doing? I told you not to mess around! No! No, please, no! Stop it! [Both panting] Come on! Xiang. - Go on. Go help Na. - You okay? Hurry! Hold on there! Wheres Na? We didnt quite finish last time. Lets finish it now. Where is she? NA: No! Get off! Stop, please! Shut up! Be quiet, or III really hurt you! I said, Shut up! Lets get a look, baby! Take it off! Yeah, get her clothes off. Take that! You crazy old man! Come on, you son of a bitch! You want a piece of me? Fight me like a man! Aaaah! Ugh! No! Papa! Xiang! - Aaaah! - No! Na! No, please! Na, who did this? Who did this to you? Xiang! Xiang! Lieutenant! Xiang! [Sobs] Shit! What in the hell have you done? - It was Bailey! - It was him!
