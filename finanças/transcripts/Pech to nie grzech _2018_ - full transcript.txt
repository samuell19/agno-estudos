There's something I want to ask you. I'm all ears. Why isn't dad with us? Sometimes I wonder, too. So? Well. It's just bad luck. Why blame luck? I'm a big girl, you can tell me the truth. Your dad wanted to stay in Brazil with your grandparents... and I just didn't fit there. You fit in Poland? Sort of. We'd better find you a dad. You mean you. Yes, me. - All right. - Promise? I promise. Yeah, sure, like when you promised to stop eating sugar? Lena, please, I said I wanted a spaceship. - And this isn't? - No, it looks like a pizza. Nobody asked you. Look how mouthy you've become after being here a whole week. Tomek, deal with the interface. Lena, fix the texturing. Listen, we have to present this on Friday. Can that be done? - Yes. - No. I can help, it's definitely doable. - Coffee? - Sure. Go get some then. To our first anniversary. It passed in a flash. Now time should really start flying, right? Stop dreaming. A relationship is a slippery slope. I know, believe me, I live in a garage with a debt collector on my back, but at first it was a fairy tale. Maniek, we're talking about the company. Sorry, I misunderstood. - But seriously... - Huh? I would have never made it without you. Everybody warned me not to run the business with a friend. - Or the friendship will be doomed. - Yeah, were they right? To us, Josh. Stop calling me that. Why? You've changed since high school but you're still little Josh. Yeah, right, all women dream of being Josh. It's just... you're not some doll. You're a cool girl. Stop making it worse. Fine, but I will never find another Josh. Let's grab a beer at the park. - I have to run. - What happened? Is it Jagoda? Pay for me, please. It's not Jagoda. Bye! See you. Hi there. A handsome man waiting for someone to taste it, just like a piece of pie. You've just been dumped. Maybe. Women see more. Do they? What do you see when you look at me? My future husband. What a bold vision. I'm interested in no less. But I have to warn you. I'm wildly jealous. Damian, wait, don't buy a new converter. You can use mine. Tonight or tomorrow. We'll see about that. You're leaving? Yes, sweetheart, I forgot it's Paula's birthday. We're having a Latino surprise party. - We should care for our friends, right? - Sure! - I need to eat more chocolate. - Be careful. - As always. Bye! - Party till sunrise, as usual. Bye. Hey. Hey, I brought the converter. I see, but I have guests so, it's not a good time. Where's the wine? I'm waiting! - Hi. - Hello. In this case, I hope you understand you can't use my converter. Sure, I get it. I'll manage. I can always buy one. I guess. Is there anything you want to tell me? I think the feelings between us are over. Do you want to talk or not? - What's the emergency? - Get up! The wedding's in an hour. Oh, fucking shit, I overslept. Will you get the rings from the office? I won't make it. Sure. - Bye. - Bye! - Where did she go? - To the wedding. - Without us? - Strange, isn't it? - With no shoes on? - There you go. I only wore them that one time at the National Opera. It was the opening night of Madame Butterfly. Josh. I've got them. Where were you? You put them on? Are you crazy? - Take them off, god damn it! - I can't take them off! Sweet Jesus. They're gone. - I'm sorry. - How is that helpful? We could borrow rings from the bridesmaid. No we can't. That would bring us bad luck. No, that's it. The wedding is cancelled! Ants ate the rings. - Darling, calm down. - No, she did it on purpose. - Stop it! - What? I warned you. I'm wildly jealous. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Such a lovely woman at such an ugly office. She's your boss's fianc√©e. - And I guess that's your usual line? - It worked 3 times. Just 3 times. Weronika will be working with us. She loves sport. We could use some exercise. That's right. And here are some gym vouchers for starters. Yeah, we love sports more than hooligans love their flares. Thanks. Be active, huh? So... Are you satisfied? Yes. - I can keep an eye on you. - Me? And Natalia. Darling, please. She is the last woman you should be jealous of. So why did you keep texting her on our honeymoon? I mean, the almost honeymoon? That was work, work related. Even on a deserted island... No way. Josh is cool. But she's a real man repellent. Man repellent. I suggest a bet. If Natalia falls in love or someone falls in love with her, I will buy you a great gift. No. I'd feel safer if she had someone. - You don't need to worry. - Really? What the hell was that? Repellent? That was low, so low. Fucking moron. Imbecile. Oh, great. Could some bird shit all over me, too? - How can I help you? - You're from Imagine Games. That's right. Who are you? I'm from another company. - I bet you're competition. - You're right, but I can still help. No, thanks. - I can manage. - But it doesn't suit a woman. What else doesn't suit a woman? Cutting down forests, road work. Hold this. You win. Change the wheel. - My name is Adam. - Natalia. - Nice to meet you. - Granny? No, no, no. Take a seat in my car, it's comfier. - Wait a moment, granny. - Straight ahead. Just a sec. - It's locked. - Don't force it. Be gentle. I'm on my way. But I have to change a wheel. Some guy is changing it. I was, but he came along and now he's doing it. What's the difference? Maybe he is handsome, but he's wearing yellow gloves. In summer. Strange. He's all right. How are you feeling? I'll get there soon. Bye! It all seems fine but I'm not going to be able to fix it. Why? It's a feminine car. Seriously? What's with your face? You tried makeup again? I'm no good at that. Watch some bloggers. Sure, and we'll get to school in the afternoon. I can take Jagoda to school. Granny, she needs to go to school, not the Copernicus Science Centre, like last time. - We had a good time. - A great time! You're too much. Let's go. You won't find a dad looking like that. - Stop talking, start moving. - Backpack, no backpack? Backpack. You want to leave like this? - Is it that bad? - It's worse. Look in the mirror. So not in the mood. But I will be sexy again. I made a promise and I mean it. I'll rise from ashes straight into a dress. - Hey. - Hi. - What's wrong? - With what? Is everything all right? I'm sorry. When my grandpa's eyelid moved like yours, he had a stroke. - Whose grandpa? - My grandpa. I'm feeling great. Have a nice day. Does it taste good? - It smells like... - Like what? - What is this shit? - Energy boosting tea. - Does it boost libido? - Is that something you need? Would you use it? Are we getting anywhere? - It's going great. - It's a nightmare. - It looks great. - You look great. Thanks. Listen, if this flies... - It's already a win. - We're set. - Have you seen Piotr? - No. He's over there. Look, we could get some recognition with this. I know. - You look strange. - What? Not really. - Different. - Not really. It's for you. VICE MANAGER Thanks. - Who is it? - Hi, it's Adam speaking. - Adam who? - Adam from the competition. You left your handbag in my car and I'd love to give it back. Oh, it's you, darling. Sorry, I didn't recognize you. The connection is bad. Let's grab some lunch together, okay? - Call me in an hour. - Am I speaking with the right Natalia? That's right cutie-pie, see you, bye! Cutie-pie? Something fresh? Yes and no. His name is Adam? Yes, Adam. Why didn't he show up at our almost wedding? He wasn't in the mood. His brother ate a snake in Africa... A snake ate his... All in all, the brother is dead, terrible story. I have to run, be right back. Lord... Look at that. Maybe I will win our bet after all. A woman on her own with a beer, something feels off. It wouldn't feel off if I were a man, right? - For all I know, you could be a man. - Maybe I am. You know about the things people have seen in Thailand. Those are things you can't unsee. Thank you, I feel much better now. I have bad luck, even in my choice of bartenders. Just like me. Terrible luck with bartenders. Okay, I have worse luck with women. I believe you can always find happiness, even in the worst misery. - Beautifully said. - Isn't it? - Off you go. - Bye! - Okay, large red, dry. - Sure thing. But it comes in a beer mug. - Excuse me, I don't want to bother you... - Then don't. But I'd like to say the wine is on me. - How many? - All of them. - Careful, I'll bankrupt you. - That's not a threat to me. I've heard enough. Get lost. But why would you drink sad? - My granny used to say... - Here we go. "A happy person is always right." She also said that I have a nice smile. Check it out. Your granny was a nasty liar. Maybe you're right. I do have a mirror, you know. All right, I'm going. I'm just tired, you know. I've been terribly tired... for eight years, or so. Life is a nightmare. You're right, it sure is. But why make it worse? I like to think it's all a state of mind. Can I just say something? - If you must. - Imagine this. Can you picture this? I live in a camper van. You'd be depressed, but I have fresh air, it's green, it's like being on holiday all year round. I don't have electricity. You'd be depressed, but to me it's a romantic candle-lit dinner every night. I can keep an eye on the parking lot, and the janitor lets me use his garden hose to take a shower. You'd be depressed. I'm just toughening up. When I get home from work, my best friend, President the dog, is waiting for me. He really is man's best friend. I have a cat. She's always waiting for me. In the evening we lie down on a Mercedes couch... and listen to hard rock. - We eat some meat pie sandwiches... - Not dog food? And we use our debt summons as napkins. Excuse me. Just a sec. What's up? Maniek, Marian Paleczny, I am the owner. What do you mean "It's on fire." Right now? All of it? My camper van burned down. Why are you so happy? President survived. He went out for a doggy date and he survived! - That is actually good news. - Of course it is! - Excuse me, my name is Maniek. - Elwira. - Great. - And I like hard rock, too. Sorry I'm late. Grandma locked me up in the bathroom. Don't. - Were you naughty? - She just acts strange sometimes. Oh, sorry about that. It's fine. I'm sorry for the silly talk on the phone. There is a dispatch guy at the company, he's horny. I had to get rid of him. Poor guy, I do feel kind of sorry for him. Oh, really? I said "kind of" because it means you're single. - I never said that. - My bad. All right, you're right, I'm a single mom. Oh, I've got some bad news, too. - You call it bad news? - It's not what I meant. Fine, you're married, or... - You're engaged, or... - It's worse. - A serial killer? - No, listen to me. I forgot to take your handbag. We have to meet again. - I can live with that. - Don't touch it. It's so terribly filthy. I think it's the smog. And then our charismatic, vigorous president asked me to get him a shark, not a small fry, because he wants to be the best businessman in the country. Bye! Very funny. This wasn't meant for you. That's right. But I saw it. I am so sorry, sorry, Mr. President. I am sorry. I suppose my ex denunciated me? This is no denunciation, it is a piece of information. But let's get to the point. It's time for you to prove your worth. I want a shark, not a small fry. Ow... Or? This is your last chance. I want the contract with GO Digital. Hi girls, I just met with the president. Thanks. You need challenges, you know. - No more money for nothing. - You have parsley in your teeth. - Do I? - No. Granny, what would you do if you liked a guy who's engaged, but a new one would come along? - I would juggle both. - I know, but I'm asking granny. If you like being a third wheel. Sure I don't. Put your hand in the fire and see what happens. Oh, this is too much. You're probably right. Okay, add cinnamon to cheese. A little bit of cinnamon and sour cream. No eggs. They make the pastry too hard. See? Your memory isn't that bad. I only remember irrelevant things. - Hi. - Hi. - It's for you. - Why did you bring me flowers? Because I like you. I know, it's a boring reason. I just wasn't expecting it. Thanks. But I'm not going to buy you lunch. That would be way too predictable. Wow. - My jokes suck. - Could be worse. I have your bag. I'm in trouble at work, I have to deal with that first. - Great, same here. - Really? Really. - Coffee? - Coffee's fine. Sausages again? Wieners, real men choose wieners. I have good news. You're getting married. Where did you get the idea? No. GO Digital wants us. A presentation for now. But they're thrilled. - You're brilliant, Josh. - I know. - Listen, I had some... - Not anymore. We have to celebrate this. But it's not a done deal yet. It's not, but Weronika is right. It's a leap forward. Dinner? Just the 4 of us. - The 4 of us? - The 4 of us. - I think I had some... - Not anymore. - But I did have... - Not anymore. I saw Natalia with a guy. I'd love to meet him. I bet it was some pal. Stop imagining romance where there is none. Actually it was my guy. But he doesn't eat dinner, he eats very little. I will cook something light. - Friday? - I suppose I don't have a choice. I have to buy a dress. - And? How do I look? - Wow. - How about me? - Wow. All right, we're done with compliments. Let's go. Let's get our story straight. - We met some months ago at the seaside. - In the mountains. My bad. But what's the difference? A thousand kilometers? Okay, we met in the mountains. We've been happily in love ever since. - That's it. - Perfect. - And never mention his illness. - Not a word. By the way, how long does he have left? You don't want to know. It's so nice that you're doing this for him. Such a young guy. He was always worried I'll be an old maid with a kid. Seeing us together will make him happy. I get it. - Kiss me. - What? Kiss me or they'll know. - The things you do to make him happy. - That's right. Maybe we should just leave and give them some space? There's no chemistry between them. Seriously? Nice terrace, right? I'm sorry, but Natalia is so irresistible. We never stop. Actually, I'm exhausted. Hot beginnings. You know what I mean. No details, please. I just can't resist. Come on, quick. Thanks for today. - I know this wasn't easy. - Let me say this. It was for a good cause. - And I have to admit I liked it. - That was too much to ask. - I don't want you to think... - Think what? That I... - That you like me too? - Yes. Would it be that bad? Listen... I'm crazy about cleaning, punctuality and sweets. - Other than that I'm perfectly normal. - I'll think about it. Maybe. Thank you. Good luck with the contract tomorrow. It will make or break my career at the company. - See you. - Bye. Thanks again. Freaking sand. - Are you excited? - Why? It's just a presentation. I meant Adam. You two would fit in a TV commercial. All you need is a dog. We'll see. Wait, this shoe is killing me. What about Weronika? Have you set another date? We're preparing invites. I bought a fountain pen, you know. Sounds serious. If you consider the return on investment you see that this contract will bring you six-digit growth within six months. Mr. Takahashi says he's impressed. Using other data sets we reach seven-digit growth. Mr. Takahashi says he would like to see this happen. Let me proceed to the next part of my presentation. Mr. Takahashi says there's no need. He is fully satisfied with what he has heard. - Good morning. We are here to meet Mr... - Takahashi. You can wait in our kitchen, try some matcha. Someone will get you in no time at all. - What's matcha? - Some sort of tea. - I know. - So why ask? - Just messing with you. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Can you imagine Mr. Takahashi as a football commentator? Are we going to see him score? - I wish I met him earlier. - We never had such a project before. I meant Adam. You've been seeing him for months while I thought you were single. This is my life. Why are you so interested? You tell your friends about this kind of stuff. I'm strange and I don't tell. - I'd like to meet him again. - What for? - To find out if he's, you know... - Fine. I'll think about it. My child, what is that? - Putty? - Pastry. I promised someone I'd bake a cake. It must be someone special if you're trying to bake. - But I can't. - I can help. Do you even like him? There's nothing to complain about. Let's make this apple pie something special. - I can take it from here. - Careful here. How did you know grandpa was the one? I performed the shoe test. - What was that? - Imagine you're having a stroll. Your heal breaks. If the man pretends not to notice or tells you to find a cobbler, or to walk barefoot, throw him out the window. What did grandpa do? He made me smile again. Granny, it's salt. - Did you bake it? - Yes. It tastes so... cosmopolitan. I like to wander off the beaten track. I... I appreciate experimentation. But I actually like tradition. - Your pie is... - Let's buy some cake. You're the one who said it. Laundry on Friday, ironing on Saturday. - And Sunday? - Sunday is my spontaneous day. - At last. - I'm not such a buzzkill, you know. Sundays are gym days. I've built mass. Now it's time to shape it. Then I go back home, do laundry and clean again. - Cookie? - Yes, please. It's far from your pie, but a cookie's always nice. I have to admit my pie was a disaster. You could have bought it, but you baked. I really appreciate your honesty. - Your new home? - Cool, right? The radio is working and wing mirrors are intact. - This is no home. - Of course it is. Home is wherever you don't have to suck your stomach in. I'm telling you. - I'm having some great time right now. - Because? - Because I'm in love. - Who is it? You don't know her. Elwira. Lovely as a butterfly, fragile as a feather, but most importantly she likes hard rock. She's a lucky woman. I might become the lucky man. It's all in progress. And I have a friend. President, come here. Come here, boy. I have something nice for you. There you go. - And a beer for us? - Have a look, look here. Let's run. Hey. - Backpack? - No backpack. Let's go. Quickly. Hi, I'd like to discuss something. Can you talk? Now is not a good time. Let's talk at work, bye. - See you. - Bye. Nice? You're nice. - I don't know what's wrong. - What is wrong? I prepared this great diet plan for you and the results aren't what I expected. Your husband won't be what you expected. Oh no. We have to practice our first dance. - No, please, no. - Let's go. Good morning, have you seen my grandmother? - Not today. - Thank you. - Natalia. - Yes? - Is something wrong? - No, thank you. Wait a second. Hello? I need help, I don't know what to do. I'll do whatever I can to help. My granny is gone. I have a conference call right now, but I'll come over as soon as it finishes. - Mum. - What is it? - I know where granny is. - What? I know where she is. Mystery solved. Okay. - Why didn't you say anything? - You never asked. You never mentioned that you were going to watch a movie. At my age I don't have to ask for permission. I know, but we were worried. I'm sorry. How are you feeling? I dreamt of Jerzy. He told me about the afterlife. He said it's not as nice as they say... but it's not bad. Pretty much the same as here? Yes. I have to fight for memories, even the old ones. Everything fades away and is gone. But memories... are all we have. Granny, you are unforgettable. There's something I'd like to ask of you. I don't want a dull funeral meal. My life was full of color. This is the plan for my wake. What are you talking about? I'll live for 100 years, that's for sure, but I outlined everything here. - Just don't read it yet. - All right. - That's it. - Isn't it too long? It's fine. Just fix the engine and send it. Great. You did well, but I would have done it better. Look at you. Are you a banker or something? - What's wrong with that? - You try too hard. - You look like my great aunt. - Excuse me? You don't try hard enough. - Coffee? - Coffee. On my way. I'm timing you. How do you know? I asked around. Adam's company also wants the GO Digital contract. Well, let the best company win. Think about this, Natalia. His corporation can do without this contract, but we can't. What are you taking about? Maybe you should find out some details. - Make this relationship valuable. - That's out of line. - So what if it is. - Don't push it. Besides... I can't picture the two of you together. - I do wish you luck but... - But what? He's not a good match for you. Nobody is, according to you. Get lost. - You don't get it, I finally... - Don't say you love him. I do. Thirty minutes, perfect. You work with your ex? Unfortunately, I really like my job. Though I have been working too much lately. Granny always says, do what you love and you won't work a day in your life. - My words exactly. - And she's right. - Granny's always right. - My granny really is. - Fucking shit, it's a beautiful view. - The best. We wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for your flat tire. I don't know what made that hole. A nail, a pin or... Rake. I don't care. This is the prettiest breakfast I've ever seen in my life. I have to get going. - I'll grab my things. - I have to run, too. Today is my judgment day. If GO Digital rejects our offer, I'm done. It can't be that bad. We don't know the future. Why worry in advance? - You spent the night out, huh? - We're withdrawing our offer. - What? - We're backing down from GO Digital. Are you crazy? Why? Some things are more important than work. You can't be serious. What are you doing? I'm the majority shareholder and this is my call. So, you are in love. Is it so strange? Focus, Mario, and tell me, am I doing the right thing? How can I help you? I know you're just an app with ready-made answers. - But you have your good moments. - Thank you and likewise. Love is more important than work, right? One rabbi says yes, another rabbi says no. Is that all? Give me some statistics. Corporate employees who fall in love suffer from diabetes less often. - Fuck this. - I'm looking for a sex shop. Stop. - I think I'm crazy. - I'm looking for a... Stop looking for a psychiatrist. I wish I could send you somewhere. I feel like eating a kilo of chocolate. Fucking Mario. Hello, how are you doing? - Fine, thanks. - I'm great. I don't remember asking but that's cool. You're a bad woman. I don't like it the way I used to. Do you want to work here or go back to the landfill? It was a recycling job. GO Digital chose another company. Imagine Games. - I imagine you know that company? - Yes, of course I do. Don't pretend you're not in a relationship with its owner. What are you implying? I don't believe you never shared information. She could have found out this and that, maybe peeked into some papers, and now she's the one with a contract, even though our offer was better. I don't think she's... You're not in a position to trust women. I don't believe they played fair. We had a better hand of cards. Your affair put us at a loss. I want you gone by Friday. Mr. President. - What's the celebration? - You don't know? We won GO Digital. - What? - You didn't know? - But I told you to... - This is our dream deal. Cheers! - Oh, a party. - Tinkie drinkie. Alcohol is bad for a dying man. Your cousin never told you? What cousin? - Who's dying? My cholesterol's high but... - Way too high. - Natalia, can we talk in private? - Sure. I told you we were negotiating with GO Digital. I wanted to withdraw but my partner... Partner? Or your dying cousin? I needed a pretext, a reason for you to go out with me. I know it was silly. - I'm sorry. - Wait. You were at my place, you had access to my papers. What are you accusing me of? My boss knows about our relationship. He thinks I made it easy for you. And who do you trust? GO Digital rejected our multimillion offer and chose your tiny company. Can you explain it? Maybe there are people who see beyond money. Or won't be humiliated by working with their ex and her lover, your ex-friend, just to keep their glamorous apartment with a view. You liked the view. Do you want to tell me something? I don't think so. I can talk to him. I'm sure we can fix this. Don't let work break your relationship. No need, thanks. Tinkie drinkie. - What? - Give me three minutes, please. I'll be downstairs. Why do you wish me harm? What are you talking about? You ruined my relationship. - I ruined it? - Yes. And you? You lost my wedding rings. Weronika almost dumped me after that. But you're together because it seems you're crazy in love. Why can't I have it, too? What's so wrong about it? You don't get it. I want you to be happy. - But? Tell me. - You don't get it. Just say it! What was that? I have no idea. Your fianc√©e is waiting. Go. So, I invited her into the wild. What could go wrong? She could dump me, that's all. - Who? - Are you seriously asking? Elwira. I miss the wild. You could join us. We'll go by bus, then a walk through the forest, a camp, campfire, some guitar music, and the dog, you know... What is it? Do you have a spare 200? As a loan. Thanks. My child, what's wrong? Were you crying? No, granny. I have memory problems. My ears are just fine. My life just got complicated. Really complicated. - Sleep on it. - On what? The problem. You'll have a solution ready in the morning. I doubt that. Ask Mario, he'll confirm. I'm sure he will. Fine. Mario, I think I'll stay single, like you. - What do you think? - I'm not single. There is a female app, Claudia. Great, congrats. Ilona threw me out after I dumped her and quit my job. - Can I crash here? - She threw you out of your apartment? Just for a couple of days, so she can find something. Will you have me? Thanks. Sorry for what happened. I got some beer. I cleaned the place, man. Hungry? I'm going to order something tasty. - Do you hear me? - I missed you and your nagging. - Damian... - I love you. - Someone for you? - Could be. - Yes? - It's about Natalia. She didn't know that my fianc√© decided against her will. She's innocent and you two should be together. - Okay, listen, we're... - We are. Damian! Do you really want to lose a unique woman because of some stupid misunderstanding? - Think about it. - All right. - You will never find a woman like her. - Could you two leave? Is something the matter? The hairdresser hurt you? You should file for compensation. Does it also work against parents? - No. Why? - You could file a motion against yours. They owe you a million for this face. - Maybe even more. - You're getting better at this. Listen, I have an idea. - But I don't know if it'll work. - Why don't you discuss it with Natalia? I want to surprise her. - Can I count on you? - Sure. - Yes? - Yes. Natalia, I'm sure it will all come out just fine between you and Adam. - I'm not. - Wait. Could you pretend that you're back together? - It would mean the world to me. - But why? I can't tell you, but do it for me, please. Please. I spend long hours here, but you know I want to be a fitness celebrity. - Stop it. - I never asked you for any favors. - Fine. It's done. - Just this once. Fine, I don't care. Bye. Thank you. Hi. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - I have an idea. - What idea? Something that will rebuild your relationship. What if it doesn't need rebuilding? Maybe we've made up? Fantastic. Show it to me. Stop licking the floor. Come on, the food's waiting. - I have to finish this. - Don't push it. - Listen, no laughing. - Sure. I think I'm in love. I asked you not to laugh. - So you just realized it? - I've been thinking the whole night. Are you sure? What's with all the questions? If you want Natalia, I'd take Weronika. I don't want any problems. Neither Natalia, nor Weronika. Yeah, and make me stand in the corner. - Should I tie it in a knot? - You should get castrated. - Thanks a lot. - Shall I call her? Go on. Good morning. Good morning, young man. Well... you look lovesick. Engaged to one, in love with another. So what's the plan? To be married to one, but in love with the other? What would you do if you were me? I'd flip a coin. Really? Of course not, silly. You know the answer. This is the kind of thing you know immediately. This way our three companies can work together. A big budget, business expertise, and our creative work, all working for those in need. Research shows that proper exercise and stimuli inhibit neural degeneration, and slows down dementia... and this is not a niche problem. In 2050 one in every 85 people will suffer from memory issues. This is great publicity. Helping those in need, blah, blah... But will this game... be popular? I think we all know people who need such assistance. I'm not convinced. Mr. Takahashi says he wants to invest in this game. No alternatives. Of course! Mr. Takahashi... this is the best decision you'll ever make. We have a deal. We need to talk. It's about Adam. Natalia, I'm sorry I went too far. - I thought we could... - I want to be alone. It works best for me. But can you forgive me? I already did. - Will you forgive me? - I already did. - Natalia is no longer with Adam. - She's keeping him at a distance. It's strategic. She wants to boost his attention. - When did they make up? - I don't know. But she's sure waiting for the question and a ring. How do you know all... Apology flowers? We're expecting a wedding. I'm not so sure. - Did you take your clothes? - What? Clothes. To change. It's triathlon day. Do we have to? Of course we don't have to but we want to. Because we love sports. Yes, we do. - Excuse me. - There you go. - I packed your things. - You're fast. Bye. - Could you open... - Of course. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Welcome back. - Thank you, but... - You can thank Natalia. She wanted to clear your name. Meet your new assistant. Do you think we can make this work at work? I think we can. Your grandpa used to say he wouldn't have married me if it weren't for these macaroons. He was madly in love with you. He would have married you even if you cooked like me. - I met a lovely man the other day. - How come? At a caf√©. I asked you not to go out alone. You'd like him. But he was in love. Maybe married. Maybe both. Married and in love, what's in it for me. - It's better than nothing. - Sure about that? If he were in love with you married to you, that would be lovely. - That would be lovely. - These macaroons are the loveliest. I want them at my wake. Stop with the wake already. - Are we making more? - I'm not in the mood. So not in the mood! So not in the... Mood. I have to apologize for the mess, but Damian lives here. He ordered some food and left everything here. I have a job! At a hair salon. And I have a guest. Clean this mess. Are you crazy? I have to read about shampoo and conditioner. It's impossible. I'm all ears. It's about Natalia. - What about her? - You tell me. She saves your job, you want to get married, everything's fine, and you treat her like some stranger. - You're wrong. - You are wrong. - No. - She's a great person, get it? - She doesn't deserve such treatment. - She's not my girlfriend and never was. - No? - No. She did all this stuff to make you jealous. She's hooked on you. - Hooked? - In love. Madly. Madly? And now if you'll excuse me. Damian is ruining my home. I must take care of this. Damian! Madly? Madly. Will you get the rings tomorrow? Sure. I forgot to tell you; I changed the menu. We'll have organic salmon after midnight. - Why? - It's healthier. - Add some grass soup. - Are you mad? We can have the beef roulade. No, why not? Salmon, carp, bream, whatever you want. I don't think I want a hen party. Same here. No stag party this time. - Why waste time on repeats? - Exactly. - What's happening? - You'll see. If you wanted to work out you didn't need the whole gym. - Hey, is this... - Yes. I got you a gift. Wait and see. Wait... I didn't win our bet. - Natalia isn't with Adam. - I know. So what is this? I can't marry you. It wouldn't be fair. You're a great woman but it can't work. Oh, lord. I'm so glad it's you! What? If I cancelled the wedding my parents would kill me. I'd have to listen to their nagging till the day they died. And this way, I can put the blame on you. So, you want to end this, too? Listen, in 20 years you'll be a fatty roly-poly, wearing the same t-shirt you're wearing now. Your cholesterol could serve as putty. Half a kilo of ham at midnight? If we're being honest, I'm not a fan of your toes. What's wrong with them? You could hang from a ceiling like a bat. I'd rather be a bat than the hunchback of Notre Dame. Go on. You all look like bonsai trees in the computer game business. Your ass is bound to grow and become one with your chair. I'm not a monkey. I don't want to jump through my life. I'm one step ahead of you in evolution! I'm so glad we're breaking up. Great. - Thanks for the gift. - You're welcome. Are you getting up? Mario asked about you. What's up? - Need some more sleep? - Yes. Promise you'll find someone better than Mario. Will you? - Promise? - I promise. Do you want something to eat? I have something delicious. This is not just a funeral dinner. Granny was a unique woman. This is a special wake organized according to her wishes. Let's begin. I wanted to ask you something. I know it's not the best time. I can cover my ears. Nothing urgent. - I want to offer my condolences. - Sure. Bye. - Mum. - What is it, darling? I think he likes you a lot. Piotr? Stop imagining things. And you like him a lot. Piotr! Hey! Fucking shit, it hurts. Natalia, is everything all right? Natalia? And where's Josh? Show it to me. Maybe we can fix this. I'm no cobbler but... Listen. Passing the freaking shoe test. - What test? Listen. - Don't yell at me. I wanted to ask, but I thought it's not a good time, but maybe sometime in the future you... - What? - Just don't say you have to ask Mario. - Yes. - What? You haven't heard the question. - But I know the answer already. - Really? Granny, I suppose you're happy now? Don't give up. Work hard. Tight abs. Good. Shoulder blades. Thighs, remember about the thighs. Straighten your back. - I'm sorry I'm late, coach. - You know the rules. One push-up for every minute. How about triathlon on the weekend? I planned CrossFit but I'm flexible. Just remember, I am wildly jealous. And I have very high expectations. And I can be grumpy because I'm off sugar. Great. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to begin my workout. Marriage? What a silly idea. It's one of the most traumatic events out there. The only thing worse is falling in love. Your brain turns into a sponge, and you talk like an idiot. We need some dignity. No matter what, never fart hearts. Maniek? Excuse me. - Mr. Marian Paleczny? - Elwira. - Po≈õwiatowska Elwira, remember me? - No other woman drinks wine from a mug. No bartender could forget you. How do you know my name? Why are you here? I got you. You were assigned to me. I saw your papers, and I have to tell you something. - I have to tell you something. - I think we should give it a go. I think we could really have something. But the thing is, you're in debt and I am the debt collector. Elwira Po≈õwiatowska! Such a beautiful name, such a terrible profession. This is an all-seasons tent. Perfect for cold nights. We will be warm. Who needs the Seychelles? And this is some sausage. Polish sausage past its expiry date, but I know from experience it's still good for another week. Where did you get the money for this tent? It's been in the family for three generations. My grandfather fled from debt collectors, and lived in the woods, my father continued this tradition, and now I hold the baton. It's a miracle I made it through the vows, and down the aisle. Now you're mine. So, tell me the truth about those rings. I dropped them on purpose, sort of. I didn't want to lose you. Not bad luck, huh? Not bad luck at all. It looks more like a stroke of luck. Very good luck.
