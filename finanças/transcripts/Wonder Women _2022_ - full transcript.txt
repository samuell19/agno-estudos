We shall spend these days together we shall all try to understand one another All will be well! Welcome to Sumana When you are pregnant the whole world is advising you and most of the time they are not even right! This is a chance for you to know yourself how things really are I think they are all settled, you can start. Yeah... Let's start with breathing exercises Bring your right hand up Let's make it a fist Open your thumb now your small finger and the ring finger now you are holding Vishnu Mudra you can gently close your eyes and take your thumb close to your right nostril close your right nostril and inhale through your left close your both nostrils and open your fingers on your left side and exhale You have gone through this entire process beautifully but when it comes to the last stage something sinks in... 'Fear' Why? Ma'am... 'Pain', I am most scared about pain That's what everyone likes to talk about, 'Pain' Yeah there is pain involved but the fear of pain is a bigger problem than the pain itself Please ask... Jaya wants to ask something Yes Jaya. I am very scared of labour pain is that why I am having these problems? No, please don't think of it that way Pain can be a guide Other than birthing, what else do you fear? I am scared of mice Scared of mice? Jaya... A mouse! I thought it is for real! Hold on... hold that position Look how you reacted when you got scared you pulled yourself inside! And what this does is, it tenses your body up you know when... ...baby is trying to come out fear makes you pull everything in! You need to relax your muscles to help the baby come out So how do you do that? By breathing... you breathe out deep breaths Relieve your mind... Release your body... Breathe in all the good energies and breathe out all your fears So the same way the mouse is not here... it's here, in our minds Just throw it out of your mind You've been so brave all these months it's only a matter of few more days... So do not let fear rule you push it away and acknowledge what you are really feeling -Hello -Advocate Nagaraj here... Yeah, yeah, yeah I was trying to call you Can you hear me? Yes. Tell me Madam. Yeah so listen... What are these things we are asking for? All the usual things Madam. What will I do with... ...an apartment in Hyderabad? I don't live there anymore In divorce petitions this is how it is. If you don't need the apartment you can always sell it. No, no, no... listen... ...listen you are my lawyer okay? I am not asking for anything I don't want any money or any apartment I don't want anything from him... I don't need anything from him... I just want out! Okay Madam. Whatever...

All this is new for me so I really like it... ...I have many pregnant friends now You know, we made a messaging group Is it? Yes it's called 'Wonder Women' Sweet no? The girls are okay... ...but there is this trainer... Bad attitude! Not a family type at all... No surname ... no family... I think she is one of those feminist types Eat up Veni... How is your Audit? Real torture Dad! Last minute submissions So tough to handle Beep Jaya... Check this out! So much happening in your friends group. -On whatsapp? -Yes... "Modern Kerala" Tea... You know there's a baby... ...like this in all of you Inside each of you, there is a small baby just like this So small? Yeah... Small, sensitive, vulnerable... ...not you, the baby. You guys are superheroes... Bringing a baby to life! Do superheroes feel so tired all the time? If they did what you are doing... ...I am sure they would be tired You are not sick or weak You are pregnant! and there's a lot going on inside of you You know scientists spent decades... ...just trying to build one single artificial limb and here you are... ...building another human being inside you You're doing it... ...everyday while eating, sleeping, cooking Even now when you are listening to me... a live baby is growing inside you Every child is one of nature's many wonders and you know what is really special? That it is happening here through you It would tire the hell out of... ...any superhero! So it's time for you to take charge Information is Queen! So better read up... ...and learn all the physical and medical interventions... ...that can happen during your pregnancy That way, you make the right decision... ...for you and your baby Nice T shirt... Shh... Why is she always shushing us? Your hands parallel to your shoulders... ... and try to sit comfortably... ... on an imaginary chair and exhale Close your eyes. Inhale and exhale Full fist and full stretch Did they allow her into class? Gracy... Can't you call when you are getting late? There was no balance in my phone! By the time I rushed there you left with her It is not enough to send her to a big school... ...discipline is what you need! Is that what the teacher said? Ofcourse, in her high flying English! Did the little one get upset? I got yelled at, not her! Ah... then it's okay How is it okay? You need a lesson... Whose idea was it to admit her in a big English School? Yes it was my idea At least let her have a better life... What? Let her have a better life What's wrong with our life? Nothing. Just that you have no credit balance on your phone That's not a big deal... ...all great people may not have credit on their phones! I have other work to do Hey Gracy! Without knowing any English, what is that point of you attending that class? I know something... You know nothing! Bala, this Friday at Sumana ... ...all husbands are coming with their wives You will come, won't you? Veni, don't you know it's the year end? I can't come. Go and ask Mother. You can't join for even a day? Whatever I say, you say "go to Mother..." "Mother will do this... Mother will do that..." Even this pregnancy... has been planned by your Mother right? So? What's wrong with that? What do you mean?! Do you know that once seven months are up... ...she is planning to move into our room and sleep with me? I married you or you mother Bala? Veni... Happy? Hold this Okay ladies! Nappy time... ...Come on let's see who's practiced the best Where's 'dragon-in-law'? She dropped me and left Well done!! Nothing like that... ...she's pissed off with me, that's all Why? I keep fighting with my mother... first time with mother-in-law Why do you keep fighting with your mother? Just like that... she keeps saying things to irritate me... "do this, don't do that, say that..." that's all, nothing otherwise Why? You don't fight with your mother or what? We are too polite to even talk to each other Mamma... The curry has no salt in it Bala you should come to the Sumana classes. You will learn a lot. You should come today Amma is coming with you right? That's enough. Bala... I have a small doubt Who is the father of this child? What are you asking mother? Just to make sure it is not me A father must do what a father should do Why should I be bothered? Your father wriggled out without doing anything... ...but you won't be able to get away with that Breaking News! I have downloaded the playlist you wanted. Thank you (whisper) My baby is not going to look like this! Sanjay! Don't say that! Want to go to Papa? Here take No... I don't want to Enough please Mini... Mini... Give me the baby Mini I will serve and come back. Please help yourself. Chechi... Serve them... I will take it later... He wanted me to get rid of the baby I didn't want to... So I left him So then the place you registered with us... ...is that your parents' home? Yeah. It's... their home. They just wanted me to go back to him So you don't live with them either? Yeah. I am okay, I have a job... I have a place to stay so... ...it's all good. I think I'm going to leave for the day You know what... this Mini thing... It's so lovely to see all of you here and I am very proud actually because you've taken the time... ...to be here to support your wives... your partner... It's not easy... ...and I am sure your wives feel the same as well. I wanted you all to be here because this is a journey that... ...you are going to go through together It is very important that you support each other supporting each other is very, very, very important and we all need our space we need to be seen we need to be heard So today open your hearts say what you would like to tell your partner You know just open up and speak your mind Nobody is judging you here So please... Bala, would you like to start? Okay It's not like Veni knows everything about babies... But yeah, definitely she's more equipped than me She's taken care of younger children, older people... ...but on the other side last time when I touched a doll as a child... ...I got scolded So you know you just can't expect me to one day suddenly turn around and get interested in all this So basically I have no clue about all these things I am with you. You know that no? You know that right? This is our first... We can do this together can't we? -Hi! -Hi... I am so thrilled at the idea of being a father that that I want to do everything she's like this Goddess making magic... Listen... I am not a goddess okay? I am just a woman a moody, irritable woman What do you mean? I am not a Goddess, I am a human woman... Sometimes I just want to go easy and have some space to myself Jojo... Stay! Stay right there okay! There is so much going on my body and head right now I can't all be excited and positive always... Even if you're sad... I will be with you baby. What are you made up of man? I'm not used to men like this! I am not able to relate to this baby Sometimes I can't even relate to you right now... But why? You know, she's been this amazing girl... so full of dreams and passion! but suddenly that person is not there anymore I miss her I know she's totally focused on the baby but everything unrelated to the baby she has just given up. I don't understand why? Can a person change so much? Of course I have changed How can I not change? I am having a baby! Everything has changed... Of course there are mothers right? Who can have a baby and nothing changes... they can leave the baby to a boarding school with a nanny... Whatever, right? But my baby is not going through that because I know how it feels ... I am going to protect her and I am going to be there for everything -Then talk to me... -When? You're never there! We don't have any big problems That is very clear... it's your second right? We weren't sure about a second child Not easy to make ends meet. Doesn't matter Gracy Everything in life can't be planned perfectly This is not the first time we have faced issues We'll figure it out Right? Of course! What is to happen will happen... At first... a baby was the most important thing to me We did a lot of things to have a baby But now, Jaya is most important The baby is only second to her Even if we don't have one, it's okay You have gone through too much... Perhaps all this happened for us to learn this Now that we have learned it, good things will happen It's okay Enough dear... I am there I am there right? I am there right? Then? Sorry Ma'am...
