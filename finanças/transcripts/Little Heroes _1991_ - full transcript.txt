(light music) - [Charley] It was the fall, I was 10 years old. (light music) I remember it because we had a beautiful Indian summer that year. It was also the year I really remember understanding what it meant to be poor. During those there months I learned more about life than any time before or since. (light music) (fire rustling) I think about it now and it seems like a million years ago and only yesterday all at the same time. Daddy's farm wasn't making any money and he and mama would argue about it sometimes. I always knew they loved each other, but when you're young you worry about it more. Mama always used to say it's what you are, not what you have, that counts. (crickets chirping) (light music) - [Dad] I sold the hay. I didn't do so good, okay? The price is down. We can't afford new anything. - [Rachael] I'm not talking about buying out the entire store, I'm talking about a few yards of cloth. Charley needs school clothes, is that so much to ask? - [Dad] It is if we don't have it! We don't have it. - [Rachael] We can't go on like this, Virge. If this farm isn't going to make a living then maybe you'd better think about going back to work in the plant. - [Dad] We've been all through that. I'm not giving up this land. I'll make it go, I just... I just need time, that's all. - [Rachael] Maybe you don't have time for this farm and a family. - [Dad] What's that supposed to mean? - [Rachael] It's not supposed to mean anything, but you've got to make some decisions. - [Dad] I have to make money more. Everything will be all right if we can just get a crop in with a big enough yield. - [Rachael] Maybe not everything. What about us? Charley and I need more from you than cross words and long hours. - [Dad] You get everything I have. I'm sorry if it doesn't always come out just the way you want it. - [Rachael] I was lucky, though, because I had a best friend who understood all that. - Hi, Fuzz. You're not mad, are ya? Can ya hear 'em? They're fighting again. But it's okay 'cause they love each other. As much as you love bologna, huh? Everything's gonna be all right, though, 'cause Daddy's crop is gonna make more than he ever thought. You don't need money, do ya? Well, people do. It's how things work. Some day we'll have a brand new house. (Charley sighs) (light music) (crickets chirping) (light music) (rooster crowing) (cows mooing) (engine rumbling) (sprinklers ticking) (birds chirping) (ground crunching) - Hi, Charley! - Hi, Alonzo! - Hello, Fuzz, old boy. Who's that hangin' around ya? - Actually, he hangs around me. Hi, Alonzo. I mean, Mr. Hanson. - Are you taller? - Of course! About an inch since last Sunday. - Well, it's hard to tell which one of us is the oldest. What grade ya in now? - Third this year. - Third? Well don't that beat all. Seemed just like yesterday you and that mongrel was pups. - He's not a mongrel, he's a dog. - (laughs) Yeah, that's right. A dog. Kinda hard to tell with old Fuzz sometimes. How'd he get a name like Fuzz anyway? He ain't very fuzzy. - You know. When he was just a little baby he was all fuzzy. My dad said, "He sure a fuzzy one, ain't he?" And that's what I named him. - Yeah, I remember now. Well, Fuzz is a good name for him. (bird squawking) Oh, look what I found. Must've put that in there a long time ago. Don't know who would want it. - Thanks. That's very nice of you, Alonzo. Mm, Mr. Hanson. - Alonzo's just fine. Now, you take good care of her, ya hear? - Bye! (light music) (leaves crunching) I'll be out at recess. You be a good dog, Fuzz. Oh. No gum during glass, you know that. (paper rustling) Stay here. - What nice old clothes. Your father must really be poor. - That's right. My daddy's poor. And your father's ugly. But some day my daddy will be rich. What about your daddy? - My father's already rich. - But he'll always be ugly. (muffled talking) (light music) (kids laughing) - No wonder she has no friends. Look at her! Know what? I'll bet she'd like to play with us at my house this afternoon. - What? But you can't invite her, she's so poor. - [Girl] Sure I can. She's perfect. - Perfect for what? - Yeah. - Perfect for what I want. Just perfect. - [Girl] What does she want? (kids laughing) - Hi. - Uh... Uh, hi. - You wanna come over to my house and play with us this afternoon after school? (Fuzz whines) - Me? - Uh huh. We're having a tea and you're invited right after school. Will your mom let you? - Oh yes, I know she will. - All right, see you there. You'll be there, won't you? - I didn't mean what I said this morning! Thank you! Hear that, Fuzz? Carol Evans invited us to play this afternoon. Now to tell mom about the tea party. But first we've gotta do our famous load up trick. Come on, Fuzz! (Fuzz barks) Come on! (door creaking) You'll never guess what! - Charlene Wilson, how many times do I have to tell you. Don't slam the screen door. - Sorry. Guess what. - [Mom] What? - Carol Evans invited me to play this afternoon. - Carol Evans? - Yeah! We're playing tea. I never thought she would invite me. - I think that's just fine. I'm glad you're finally getting some new friends besides Fuzz there. - Fuzz is my best friend, but he's kinda big to play tea very good. - He's kinda big to do anything very good except eat. Here, let me look at ya. You should always be neat and clean. Do you have clean underwear on? - I'm not gonna get run over by a truck. (Charley groans) - Charley, don't slam- (door slams) the screen door. (upbeat music) - Come on, Fuzz! Hurry! (grass rustling) (birds chirping) Fuzz, you wait here. You're too big to play tea. Anyway, I don't think you were invited. Bye, Fuzz. (ground rustling) (light dramatic music) - [Carol] Here she is now. - I came as quick as I could. - We were waiting for you. Oh, you don't sit here with us. We invited you to play our servant. You take the teapot and cookies and serve them to us, but only when I call you. (girls snickering) You guys wanna go to the ice cream parlor tomorrow after school? - Yeah! - And then we get the park. - Yeah, that'd be fun! - [Girl] How do you guys like your tea? - [Girl] It's good. - [Carol] Guess what. My birthday's coming up soon. - Really? - Cool! - How old are you? - Yeah! - I'm gonna be 11. It's coming up in a couple days. - [Girl] Well, what do you want for your birthday? - I want a doll and I want a new dress and I want a horse and I want a pony and I want some earrings. (girls laughing) Would you like more tea, Amy? - Yes, more tea, please. (girls laughing) (light dramatic music) (Amy screams) - You did that on purpose! (girls screaming) (table clattering) (Fuzz barks) - You ruined my party! (girls screaming) What are you doing? You ruined my party! (girls screaming) (thudding) You ruined my party! You ruined my party! - Young women don't roll around on the ground and fight like ruffians. Now how about some more Koolaid and some cookies inside? - [Girls] Yeah! - Dear, perhaps you better go home now and take your dog. - But I want some more Koolaid, too. - If you're thirsty there's a hose around back of the house. (light dramatic music) (door clangs) - And then when we were done playing and Mrs. Evans invited us all in for more cookies and Koolaid inside. Their house is so big and beautiful. - I hope you remembered your manners and thanked Mrs. Evans. - Yeah, I said thanks. - Might be nice to send a little thank you card. - The girl was just over there playing, not going to a reception. - Carol Evans is the kind of friend I'd like Charley to have. Wouldn't hurt to send a little thank you card. - Oh, we don't have to send a card. I mean, Daddy's right, don't you think? - Just 'cause Carl Evans owns a drugstore don't make him any better than us. - Having money doesn't make him any worse either. - It's always money with you, isn't it? - No, it's not always money, it's always no money. - Then why in the... Why in the world did you marry me? - It seemed like a good idea at the time. (paper rustling) (crickets chirping) (light music) - Too late to do star bright. Wishes don't happen anyway. I bet I wished on a million stars. Not one ever came true. Not one. Well, I guess like Mama says, "If wishes were fishes there'd be no need for fishermen". I never did anything to them. I just wanted to be their friends. (Charley sighs) I wish wishes did happen. (light music) (crickets chirping) (upbeat music) (paper rustling) - And then you come around like this and fold a rubber band over it. See? - How many? - About 200. But you gotta pick 'em up at three o'clock and start gettin' 'em folded. - Okay. - You can use my bike 'cause you don't got one. Can you ride a bike? - Of course, what do you think? I can ride a bike, but I never rode a boy's bike. They're the same? - Yeah. Except for this. You gotta watch out for this bar so that you don't fall on it. It hurts. (paper rustling) (light music) (upbeat music) Come on, I'll show you my route. - Come on, Fuzz. (leaves rustling) (light dramatic music) (light music) (leaves rustling) I gotta rest! - Okay, but I've gotta do this. People don't like to have to chase their newspapers, so you gotta throw it right on the porch. - What if I miss? - You go back and put it on the porch. - Oh. (leaves crunching) - Like I told ya, every day at three for the papers. Fold 'em and get 'em delivered by five. Remember, Mr. Peterson can't bend over so you have to put his in the mailbox. Mrs. Cox has arthritis so don't put a rubber band on hers. And Mrs. Evans hates for her paper to be dirty and muddy so make sure you don't throw hers in the flower garden. - I could throw hers right through the window. - We're leaving Saturday for our vacation and we'll be back in a week. - I wish we could go on a vacation. I bet they're fun. - You've never been on a vacation? - Only once when I was a baby. Mama took us to South Carolina, but I can't remember it. - Well, maybe you'll get to go again sometime. (leaves crunching) - How much again? - Huh? - You said that you'd pay me if I took your paper route, remember? - Yeah, I remember. I already told ya. $4. But you gotta do it right every day. - I'll do it right. Fuzz will help me. (leaves crunching) - Don't let him pee on anybody's lawn or nothing. - He hardly ever does that anymore. - Good. (light music) (birds squawking) (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (paper rustling) (light dramatic music) (paper rustling) (light dramatic music) (bike clattering) (paper rustling) (light dramatic music) (dramatic music) (light dramatic music) (bike ticking) (dramatic music) (light music) Go get it, Fuzz! (upbeat music) (smacking) Sorry! (bike ticking) (light music) (Fuzz barking) (birds chirping) (light music) (paper rustling) (dramatic music) (light dramatic music) Come on, Fuzz! Hurry! (Mrs. Evans sighs) (door thuds) (light music) Isn't it wonderful? I've got enough almost. With what we get from Fritz we'll even have some leftover. (Charley sighs) (metal clanking) - [Rachael] You done your homework yet? - No. - [Rachael] Better get to it. (Dad sighs) - She still doing Fritz's paper route? - [Rachael] She's almost done. His family will be back on Saturday. - [Dad] How much is he paying her? - I'm not sure, shall we go up and rifle her piggybank? - Hey, look. I was just asking! You think I like having my kid work this young? (Dad sighs) (chair thuds) (heavy breathing) (light dramatic music) Sorry about last week. About the money. - Sometimes sorry just doesn't do it, Virge. I know it's hard, but you take it out on all of us. (Virge sighs) - I don't mean to. - I know that, but Charley doesn't. All she sees is us fighting. - Yeah, but we don't fight all the time. - Don't we? When was the last time we got through a supper without an argument? I can't remember a time. - I can. - When? - Corndogs at the hotel-motel. - My word. I didn't mean that far back. - I did. Honey, I'm sorry, truly. No more fights. If you won't, I won't. Agree? - I worry about how it's effecting Charley. She's so withdrawn. She hardly has any friends. She worries about us staying together. So do I sometimes. - Don't. Besides, I need help with the hay, Alonzo's too old. (Rachael hums) (light music) (bugs chirping) (upbeat music) - Come on, Fuzz! (Fuzz barks) What? (Fuzz barks) Oops. Come on. (light music) You're back early. How was it? - What? - Your vacation, silly. What'd ya think? - Car broke down. We didn't make it all the way to the giant redwoods. - Where did you make it to? - [Fritz] Fresno. - What's that? - [Fritz] A town. - Was it fun? - Yeah, kinda. Our motel had a swimming pool. That was neat. - Wow, really? - Yeah, but we only got to stay there a couple of days until the car was fixed. Then we came back. - I'll do your papers for you even though you're back early. - Nah, I'll do it. Is three all right since you didn't have to do it the whole time? - How about $3.25? - It's all I got. - Deal. Come on, Fuzz! Hurry, Fuzz! See that? (coins rattling) It's adding up. We'll be rich soon. Only two. Mama thinks the price keeps going up and we get less. (paper rustling) You don't eat, you inhale! Ugh. You'd eat anything, would ya, Fuzzbucket? Come on. Come on. (birds chirping) (kids laughing) - I think the golden girl wants to talk to you. - Probably still mad at me about last week. Bye, Fritz! - Hi. - Hi. - My mom said she sent you home 'cause your dog. I told her it wasn't your fault. I'm sorry she did that. - It's okay. I'm sorry I ruined your tea party. - You didn't really. It's more fun than we usually have playing. I've never seen a dog jump up in the middle of the table before. - Fuzz kinda gets carried away sometimes. - I can't have a dog. Mom says that dogs are dirty and have fleas. - Well, Fuzz used to, but I give him a bath about every month so he doesn't stink. (Carol giggles) - I shouldn't of made you be the servant when we played. My mom says that people who don't have what we have are poor and I shouldn't associate with them. - My mama says that all people are the same no matter what they got. - Amy says I shouldn't, but I want to invite you to my birthday party a week from Saturday. - Me? - Uh huh, it's at two o'clock. I don't care what Amy says. - [Charley] Thanks! - You don't have to bring me a present if you can't afford it. - I can afford it, I got my own money. How old you gonna be? - 11! - I'll be there. - [Carol] You can bring your dog if you want. - I'll put him on the hill so he doesn't come and wreck your table again. (Carol giggles) - Come on. (ground rustling) (birds chirping) - Hi, Alonzo. Broke down again? - Yeah, it's that old baler. I don't think that old thing will ever be right again. - Sure it will. Besides, my daddy needs to use it for the hay. - He'd probably be better off if he did it by hand. Sorry, old boy, nothing this afternoon. Right up to my tuchus in grease. - Can I go help you? - No, no. I want you to stay away from that baler. When it's running it could take your arm right off. I broke the shear bolts again, I gotta replace 'em. Man, it's always something. - Gotta go. I've been invited to a birthday party. - [Alonzo] Is that right? Who's birthday? - Carol Evans. She invited me herself. - Well, she did, did she? How about that. - You know her? - Yeah, I do. I know her mother better. Well, have a good time. Oh! Keep your eye out, skunks or foxes or something have been raiding my chicken coop again. - [Charley] Okay. - Don't let him around any skunk, you'll smell a whole world a... - Fuzz? - No, no, the skunk. Yeah. Yeah, well Fuzz, too, I guess. Hey, boy. You ain't got a taste for chickens, have ya? - He don't chase chickens. - That's good. Well, still I gotta figure out something to stop 'em. - Bye! (leaves rustling) (birds chirping) (door screeching) Stay here, Fuzz. - [Rachael] Charley, is that you? - Yeah, Mama. - [Charley] My land child, you look like Fuzz dragged you in. - Guess what? - Salvation Army drafted you? - What army? - Nothing. What? - Carol Evans invited me to her birthday party next Saturday. - You and Carol are becoming quite good friends, aren't you? - Yeah, she's pretty nice, really. - Well, you can't go looking like that. (light music) (water dripping) (metal screeching) (ground rustling) - What's down here? - A secret. - A secret? - Can you keep a secret? - Sure. (light music) (water dripping) - Mad money. - Who are you mad at? - Nobody. Just crazy. (light music) - [Charley] What are you gonna buy, Mama? - [Rachael] It's a surprise. You'll see. - [Charley] Wait right here, Fuzz. We're only gonna be a minute. (light music) - [Clerk] Charley, I've got that pretty piece with all those bright colors in. Do you like that? - I wonder if we could look at something else. - [Clerk] Okay. I've got this pretty blue polka dot. And it comes with a matching coordinate. - No. (light dramatic music) Anything else? - [Clerk] Yes, I sure do. How about this one, Charley? - No. (light dramatic music) (light music) (light dramatic music) No. No. (thudding) No. - I've got one more. How about that one? (light music) (Rachael giggles) (Charley sighs) (bugs chirping) (upbeat music) (door clattering) (paper rustling) - Do you like it? It's a dress. - It is? - The most beautiful dress in the world. - When will it be ready? - By Saturday I expect. - It's beautiful. Wait till Daddy sees it. - We're going to surprise Daddy. Remember? - He'll love it. (paper rustling) (light music) (ground rustling) (birds chirping) See this? This is mad money, Fuzz. But it's not for when you're mad. Crazy, huh? We'll buy Carol the doll. I wanted it, but she'll love it, too. (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (birds chirping) - Hi, Charley. - Hi, Charley. - Hi, Charley. - Hello there, Petersons! I wonder what church is like. Hi, Alonzo. - Going to church, you wanna come? - Can't. - Ah, you're welcome. All right. See you later. - Hello. Nice to have you with us as well. - Thank you. - Good morning, Mrs. Evans. - Oh, Mrs. Evans. - He are happy to see you. - Nice to see you. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Evans. - [Girl] Good morning. - Good morning. (light organ music) (muffled talking) - Reverend. - Alonzo. - Ma'am. - Good morning.

It's on there about two weeks. - I turned it over a couple of times this morning, couldn't get it again. Look at these connections. - They glued some.

(light music) Hello there, Fritz. - Wanna play pirates today? - Can't, I'm going to a birthday party. - [Fritz] Whose? - Carol Evans. - Carol Evans invited you to her birthday party? - And Fuzz. - Carol Evans invited you and Fuzz to her birthday party? - Why wouldn't she? - About a million reasons. - [Charley] Gotta go. (door creaking) (light dramatic music) - Charley. Nice to see you in church Sunday. - Thanks. Um, I need some bologna and ham. - Ham. - Guess where I'm going today? - Oh? Where might that be? - To a birthday party. - Whose party? - Carol Evans. She invited me herself. - [Mrs. Evans] Bologna, some hot dogs, and a roast. - [Clerk] Party today, huh? - Yes, Carol's birthday. Why, hello, Charlene. - Hello, Mrs. Evans. How are you? - I'm just fine. Did I hear you correctly just now? Carol invited you this afternoon? - Yes, ma'am. At two o'clock. My mother even made me- - (gasps) Dear, that girl. Dear, Carol made a mistake in the guest list. I'm afraid we've invited too many children. You see, there just won't be enough if you were to come. Besides, you might not feel comfortable with the other children. You know, not fit in? - You mean I'm not invited? - Well, I'm just saying it was a mistake. It's for your own good, don't you see? I wouldn't want you to feel out of place. - Out of place? - Yes, you see, some people just don't get along well with other people. They're different, you know. And it's always better to stay with their own types of friends. Do you understand? - No. - Well, darling, you will in time. Believe me, it's best. - Here you are, Mrs. Evans. Just the way you like it. (somber music) - I can't tell Mama, Fuzz. So we'll just go buy the doll, okay? It'll be our secret. (money rustling) (light music) (light music) - Here, let's take this bandage off. I'll fix your hair. You'll be the prettiest girl at the party. (muffled yelling) (light music) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday ♪ - We can't tell Mama, Fuzz. She would be hurt. So we just won't tell her, okay? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - We'll just sit here and watch all the games so we can tell Mama how much fun we had at the party. - [Carol] You go back and you go back! Green light! Red light! You go back! Green light. Red light! (kids laughing) (light music) - Don't let anybody see you. (ground rustling) (light music) Come on, Fuzz. Come on. (sprinklers ticking) - I need to get another baler. It's another $250. We're gonna have to borrow a lot. I don't know how I'm gonna do it. - How was the party, honey? - It was wonderful. We played red rover, green light red light, and then we had ice cream. I think she liked my present best. - What present? Where'd you get this dress? - [Charley] Isn't it wonderful? Mama made it. - Did you fall down? - What? - There's dirt all over your new dress. - Oh, well, we... Had ice cream on the grass. - How much did this cost? - Not much, I had some extra. - Extra? We don't have any extra right now, you know that. - She needed something. She hasn't had new clothes for over a year now. I made the dress, the cloth was little enough. - I'm trying to keep us on a budget to pay for the machinery to run this place and you're out buying material we can't afford for a party? - Why should she suffer just because you can't make this rundown farm work? - Oh, that's it? Me again? - Stop it! Just stop it! You're always fighting all the time. Why do you always have to fight? Please just stop it! - Charley, honey. There's more to life than money, Virge. Does that ever occur to you? (door slams) (bugs trilling) (birds chirping) (crickets chirping) (Rachael sighs) I can't find either one of them. (Virge sighs) - I'll find her. (door slams) (ground rustling) (crickets chirping) (light dramatic music) Charley. Come on, let's go home. - Daddy. Here's the money for the dress. It's my money. You can have the rest of it. - You keep your money. I don't need it. Come on, now. Stand up, be careful. Come on. - Lunchtime! - Already? - Yep. - Let me guess. Bologna? (Charley laughs) Okay. (Fuzz barks) - Fuzz, where you going, boy? Fuzz! (light dramatic music) (Fuzz barks) Fuzz, you know better than that. Hi, Alonzo. Alonzo, you're bleeding! - Caught my hand on the plunger. Bit my thumb off. (dramatic music) - Here, hold this. Come here, Fuzz. Come here. Pull tight. Pull tight! (birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) Is he... Is he dead? - No, no, he's resting now, but it was close. - How is he? - Well, he lost his left thumb, but he's a tough old bird. He'll be all right in a few days. Using a belt, now that was quick thinking, young lady. You saved his life. - Actually, Fuzz did it. - Fuzz? - [Rachael] Her dog. - Oh. - He pulled on the belt so Alonzo didn't bleed no more. - Anymore. - Anymore. - Well, that's some dog, huh? - [Charley] Yep, he sure is. - Well, if you folks wait around here I'll let you see Alonzo, but only for a few minutes. It's all right, he's fine. It was just his thumb, he'll be fine. (light dramatic music) - The doctor said he'd be all right. - Yes, he'll be fine. He's lost his thumb. - Listen, um... - I didn't know you knew Alonzo. Mr. Hanson. - Yes, I do. - You can see him now, but just for a minute. (light dramatic music) - Ruthanne? - Hello, Daddy. That's why I never told anyone. I was so ashamed of being poor, when I married and suddenly had money I thought I hated everything I used to be. That's why I wouldn't let you come to the party. You reminded me of... Of me when I was little. I'm so sorry, Charley. You saved his life. Can you ever forgive me? - It's okay. - Thank you. (birds chirping) (light dramatic music) (ground rustling) (Fuzz barks) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) - Come on, Fuzz! - He'll come home. You know Fuzz, he's probably out chasing a rabbit. - Where are ya, Fuzzbucket? (light dramatic music) Where are you, Fuzz? Fuzz? Fuzzbucket? Come on, Fuzz. Fuzz? Fuzz? Where are you, boy? Fuzz? Fuzz? Fuzz? - Fuzz? Come on, Fuzz. Here, boy! Fuzz! (Rachael whistles) (hands clapping) Come on! Come on, Fuzz. - Fuzz! Fuzz! Fuzz! Where are you, Fuzz? Fuzz? Boy? Where are you, Fuzz? Fuzz! (Virge whistles) - Here, Fuzz. Come on, boy. Come on. Heel, Fuzz. (whistles) Here, boy. Fuzz. - Fuzz! Fuzz! Fuzz? Fuzz? Fuzz? Fuzz? (Virge whistles) - Hey, Fuzz. Here, boy. Come on, Fuzz. Come on, boy. Come on. (engine rumbling) (light dramatic music) - Please, God. Let him be all right. Please. He's my best friend. (engine rumbling) (somber music) - See him anywhere? - I looked all over, I can't find either one of them. Have you looked out there? - No, let's go. - Where are you, Fuzz? Fuzz? Where are you? (somber music) - [Charley] I cried until there were no more tears inside to cry out. - You understand? If we bury him the animals will just dig him up again. This is the best way. - [Charley] Daddy tried hard to make me feel better, but I think he felt as bad as I did. (fire crackling) (somber music) I thought back upon all the things we'd been through together; ruining Carol's tea party, playing pirates with Fritz, helping me deliver all those papers. My 10-year-old brain just couldn't accept the fact that he was gone. From that point on, I changed. Things that seemed so important before weren't as important anymore. I didn't care about anything, really. For the next six weeks I just pulled into myself. Away from everyone. - How do you like it? It'll be the prettiest at Carol's Thanksgiving party, don't you think? - [Charley] I couldn't really answer her. (light music) I would just keep going back over and over in my mind, thinking of all the things Fuzz and I used to do. ♪ I always thought you were the best ♪ ♪ I guess always will ♪ ♪ I always felt that we were blessed ♪ ♪ And I feel that way still ♪ ♪ Sometimes we took the hard road ♪ ♪ But we always saw it through ♪ ♪ If I had only one friend left ♪ ♪ I want it to be you ♪ ♪ Sometimes the world was on our side ♪ ♪ Sometimes it wasn't fair ♪ ♪ Sometimes it gave a helping hand ♪ ♪ Sometimes we didn't care ♪ ♪ 'Cause when we were together ♪ ♪ It made the dream come true ♪ ♪ If I had only one friend left ♪ ♪ I'd want it to be you ♪ ♪ Someone who understands me ♪ ♪ And knows me inside out ♪ ♪ And helps keep me together ♪ ♪ And believes without a doubt ♪ ♪ That I could move a mountain ♪ ♪ Someone to tell it to ♪ ♪ If I had only one friend left ♪ ♪ I'd want it to be you ♪ (light music) ♪ If I had only one friend left ♪ ♪ I'd want it to be ♪ ♪ You ♪ (door clattering) - I was just talking with Alonzo. We decided if we combine our crops next year we can make more money if we sell them to Stock Feeders Cooperative. He'd said he'd be over later to talk about the details. He said he had something to show us. (bugs trilling) (birds chirping) (knocking) (Rachael sighs) (paper rustling) (door creaking) - Alonzo, Mrs. Evans. Can I get you anything? - Oh, no thank you. We came to see Charley. (light music) (puppy whining) - He's sure a fuzzy one, ain't he? (light music) - [Mrs. Evans] He's so cute, what are you gonna name him, Charley? - [Charley] I think I'll call you Little Fuzz. - [Alonzo] Well he ain't very fuzzy. - [Charley] Sure he is. Come on, Little Fuzzball. Let's go outside. - [Rachael] Charley, don't slam- (door slams) the screen door. (crickets chirping) - [Charley] I realized now that it was the best time of my life. Our family never did get a big fancy house or have a lot of money, we had something better. We had each other. I guess Mama was right. The most important people in the world are right in your own house. (upbeat music) (light music)
