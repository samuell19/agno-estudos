[April] You're right, I couldn't tell a thing from your blueprints. But, Summer... this is amazing. [sighs] Thank you. I'm so glad the city bought this place instead of tearing it down. I know, right? We need to preserve these gorgeous old buildings. They just need a little update. You know, the lease on my shop isn't up for another six months but after that, if there's space, I'm in. -Hmm. -That's a deal. You sure you're gonna be ready to open the doors by Christmas Eve? Oh yeah, as long as we stay on schedule. Do you want me to hide your kids' presents at my house? Yes, please. Would you mind picking up Chloe from school for me today? I have to go see Mom. Sure. She left me a cryptic message saying that it was urgent and that I needed to bring the SUV. Is it "five-alarm" Viv or "eureka, I've found the meaning of life" Viv? I really have no idea. I mean, it's Mom. [radio] And if you're just tuning in, welcome back and Merry Christmas. Hometown for the holidays and we're bringing you another half hour of Christmas tunes. Still not seeing snow in the forecast or on the slopes so let's cross our fingers and sing along. Well hallelujah, salvation. Oh darling, don't you look wonderful? Mom... have something you wanna share? Here. What's mine is yours. I mean, what's going on? Well, Merle moved back to Arizona to be near his kids. Didn't I tell you that? No. You didn't tell me that. You broke up? Honestly the relationship was going nowhere. Just the universe's way of telling us to move it along. Yeah, but he just leaves and you have to get out of his house? Oh, no, no, no. I told him it was okay to put it on the market. I mean, who knew it was going to sell so quickly? So, you're going home? No, that's gone. Your home is gone? Well, I know I told you that. The Wilkes Mountain Animal Rescue just took the whole thing. I thought you just rented it to them. No, no. Be careful with that now. The dreamcatchers are in there. Put it on the top. It's very fragile. So, you sold it to them, all of it, including the acreage. Who helped you with the valuation? Well, they paid what they could. I didn't need the money and Merle said I got a big tax deduction. No, no, no, no, Mother. Come on. You have to take it back. Oh, don't be silly. The llamas have settled in. And besides, I need to find a place that's smaller. I need a new start. Okay. Okay. So where are you going? Well, there's a lot of B & B's and there's no snow so someone should have room. It's Christmas. It's the high season. You can't just all of a sudden start looking for a place now. You should stay with me. [laughs] At your house? Yeah. There's plenty of room. For you and me under the same roof? Yeah. We'll find a way to make it work, Mom. And Chloe will love it. Oh... Chloe. Well... alright. Let's give it a try. Okay. I just need a moment. I'll finish up. You go on ahead, I'll be right behind. Well, this is it. Thank you, house. [bells chiming] Merry Christmas. Oh, there you are. Hey Mom. Thank you. What's this? Your grandma's coming to live with us. Yes! Can she help me with my costume for the Christmas carnival? I'm sure she would love to. Your grandma is an elf expert. Where do I put the juicer? Oh, no. Listen Chloe, I promise you, if your grandma makes a shake darker green than... I don't know, a Christmas tree, you don't have to drink it. -You promise? -I swear. Here it is. I saved the best for last. Oh Chloe, I've got a little trolley outside. Will you go get it, sweetie? Trolley? Now we need a nice, empty surface. Oh, this looks perfect. Oh, your decor is lovely, dear. Everything matches beautifully. Thanks Mom. Is that our old Christmas village? Yes. I haven't seen it since I moved. Oh, I just hope that all the pieces are still intact. We have a Christmas village? We do indeed. It's a big tradition in Port Clark, Pennsylvania... where your great-great-great grandfather Todd came from. But when he moved to Colorado, and he couldn't bring his family's village with him, so he made one especially for here. This looks just like our hardware store. Well, of course. He made a model exactly like Bryson Falls the way it looked way back then. And if you look in some of these boxes you'll find things that look just the way it does now. That's so cool. Mom, is this really where you wanna put it? Oh, it's such a nice, big surface. Everyone can enjoy it. Yeah, they won't miss it. It's just like the church downtown. Yeah. And look... Newlands. Kind of beat up. [laughs] Yes. Well, it has seen better days. But thankfully your mom is fixing it so it'll be great again. Mom can fix anything. Okay. We can set it up here on the table but just let me lay down some felt or something so that we don't scratch the surface. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I wanna see what it does. It doesn't do anything. It just sits there and collects dust. I'll be right back. I'll get some rags to clean it up. Your mom never believed in it but I think this village is magic. In fact, I know it is. It's full of Christmas spirit and possibility. -Really? -Mmhmm. You just make a wish and watch what happens. But where do the people go? Anywhere you want. Oh Chloe... let your imagination fly. Oh, look, Mom, I cleared out a drawer here for all of your stuff. Oh, oh, oh, oh... No, no, no dear. Here, let me have these. It's easier for me if they're handy. You know, if I can see them it inspires me to use them. Well, you don't have to do anything tonight. I'll make dinner and you relax. Oh, don't be silly. I can pull my own weight. Of course you can, Mom, but I've already started prepping some chicken. Oh... buckwheat pilaf would be a perfect side dish. Good thing I brought buckwheat and mushrooms. Chloe, how's math going these days? Still hate it. Right. That's why you should be doing that homework first. Why don't you go get your homework? You just can't wait to get back to that village. You know, we never gave kids homework at the Spencer's School. It's too... stifling. You go on, sweetie. Go on. Chloe, I said you have to go do your homework first. So, please go get it. Mom, we have rules in this house and those rules are set in place so that we can get what we need done when we need it done and that we get where we need to be on time. Oh, I see. And everything will just crumble if Chloe plays for a while. Yes. Yes, they would crumble, okay? She has to do her homework. She can't show up at school tomorrow and say she didn't do her homework because she felt stifled. She has to get it done. And she likes to do her homework before dinner so that she can play and have a little screen time after dinner. Please, let me be in charge of the schedule. Of course. You're in charge. Yes. I am. Control is an illusion, Summer. If I taught you nothing else I thought you at least learned that. Mom, can we please not do this? Alright, alright. I've released it. This is your path. It's not for me to change it. But... for your own sake, I wish you would just learn to let go a little. You know, learn to let some good come into your life. Who knows? You might even have a love life. [sighs] My life is full. My daughter is happy. I'm happy, that's a lot. Of course it is. I don't need a love life, I'm not greedy. Love isn't greedy, sweetheart. [magical music] [upbeat holiday music] Mom gave her house to Buddhists? Oh. No, four-legged llamas. Oh. But I don't know if she sold it or if she just got a tax break. The point is, she doesn't have anywhere to live. No. No, no, no, no, no. Mom needs a home, her roots in the ground, her stuff on the walls. You know how she is. I do know. How is she as a roommate? We're both trying very hard but she pushes my buttons. She's already told me that I need a love life. Well... Okay, no piling on. I'm not exactly. I mean, I would never say it because that's just not me. But now that Mom has said it you feel free? Look, I am dating, okay? It's just there hasn't been a spark or a, you know, whatever. Uh-huh. Ooh. This would be some nice stuff for the wreaths. Oh yeah, the wreaths. Alright. So, are the kids still into it? The Todd family annual free expression Christmas wreaths? Um, yes, exactly. Ooh. "No rules, just let your imagination fly." Yeah, only I have one rule. It's mandatory. [Summer laughs] I mean, Sam and Molly still love it. Wyatt is a bit too tween so who knows what he will come up with. -Wow. -Really good. Very good. Well, it'll be fun. You know, I could take Vivian for a while. Sam could bunk in with Wyatt. But you like your marriage, right? And you wanna keep it? Yeah, she doesn't set me off like she does you. That might be true but Vivian had a little chat with me last night after dinner about how she wants to talk to Matt about his plumbing business because she thinks that it congests his chakras. Okay. Well, never mind. [laughs] But I can take her for walks away from the house. I appreciate it but I'm okay. Oh. We'll, um, keep her in tow for the time being. You know she's not a kid. She acts like a kid and she has all these opinions and no plan. You know what? I have a plan. I've already talked to a realtor... we're gonna look at houses later. -Split it with you. -Amazing. [Chloe] I'm home. You decide about that wall? [Summer] I just don't see it yet. I don't know, maybe we should just leave it raw. For now anyway, we should focus on moving the Christmas tree over to the corner, give us more room. I'll have the crew move it. Great. I'm gonna start taking down some of the breakable ornaments, okay? Thank you. Oh, hey Cliff... Can I help? [gasps] I make that catch 20 percent of the time so count yourself lucky. I'm Ryan Scott. Summer Ashby. Hi. What are you doing here? I mean... can I help you? Yeah. I'm, uh, volunteering for the annual toy drive. Oh. I don't run that anymore. Uh, it just became too much. Dealing with all of this, getting it ready before Christmas. Right, I know. I mean that's... that's why I'm here. I'm running it now. Oh. Thought it'd be a good way to get a feel for the town. You're new in town? Yeah, a couple months now. Okay then. Well, I mean, sure is a good way to meet people. Yeah. Yeah. I need some help, I was wondering if you had a corner of this space we could use for the toy drive? We need a central collecting point. Oh yeah, yeah. I can definitely have a space cleared out for you. You're the boss here? Well, the city owns the building but I'm the architect and the designer, so, I guess, I am for right now. Really? Wow, you do really great work. Thank you. Most architects wouldn't take time to appreciate the rafter joist connection there. It's really smart. Well, my whole concept is to accentuate and enhance the original foundation, so it... You know architecture. I do, yes. A little bit. Well, I will definitely make sure something is set up for the toys. -Great. -Okay. -Thank you. -Yeah, no problem. Do you wanna get dinner some time? Um... I mean, not tonight. Tomorrow? Yeah. Tomorrow that'd... that'd be great. [Ryan] Um, how about Lucia's? I think you mean DeLuca's. DeLuca's, yes. I'm new in town. -I love it. -Great. Um... 7:00? Is that too... Perfect. Okay. Great. I'll see you there. [Ryan] See you there. Okay. [Summer] How old is the roof? It was replaced about seven years ago. Okay. Central air? Water heater? Also seven years old. And yes, central air. Okay. Uh, do you have an inspection report I could look at? I can get it for you. These rooms get a lot of light. Oh yeah, it's beautiful. Mom, what do you think? The garden is nice but that room right off the living room, absolutely not. The feng shui is terrible. It's only been on the market two days. It won't last. Maybe you could just put some plants everywhere, hang some pictures? No. It won't work. -This is not it. -[Summer sighs] So, is that in the ballpark? What's your range? Well, two bedrooms are plenty. That's not what I meant. And I need a garden. Well, the house doesn't have to be huge but... but I'll know it when I see it. See, like that house over there. Now that'd be perfect but it's not for sale. But, we can find something just like that, okay? Okay. Thanks for this, sweetie. I think I'm gonna walk back. I need to fill my lungs with spruce. See ya later. Bye. [sighs] [playful music] Okay. Here we go. Got it? That'll get it. Hey, we decorate tonight. Your niece and nephew are baking cookies especially for Uncle Ryan. I will definitely be there. We could get used to having you around. I could get used to it too. It feels good. -Yeah? -Yeah. What happened? I don't know. Maybe nothing. We'll see. Oh. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Mom. -What are you doing? -Homework. Oh, what? Uh... I have to write a report about a Christmas tradition and I'm doing it on the Christmas village. 'Kay. Where's the homework part? I'm visualizing. [laughs] Okay. Um, has your grandma come back yet? Yeah, I think she's in the garden preparing something for a winter "solsteads." -The winter solstice, right. -Oh. Well, your grandma has the best garden in town, so she knows what she's doing. I'm gonna start making dinner. Um, if you've finished with all this really important homework, maybe we can watch a show after. Yeah. [Summer] Great. [magical music] [upbeat holiday music] ...Yeah, I just asked her out. [April] Just like that? He asked me out two minutes after we met. That is sudden. That's good, right? Told you you'd like this place. Yeah, it was the weirdest thing. I don't even know if she's single, it just flew outta my mouth. So I should dress casual, right? Wait. You said yes? You think it's a bad idea? No. No. I'm just surprised. I was too. It just all happened so fast, you know. But maybe it's nothing. Maybe he's just looking to meet new people in town, you know? But... But she said yes. Yeah, but I don't know. That's the spirit. There was a spark. Mmhmm? Maybe. I don't wanna make a big deal out of this. Alright, this should be enough wood to get me through a couple cold nights. Don't tell me you're taking off then. You just said you met someone. Give it time. I know. I got a house. A rental. For six months with an option. And there's a pantry and I'll fill it with food and, you know, cook. I know your divorce was brutal but... Chris, I am trying. I know. I'll shut up. Listen, have fun tonight. Yeah. I will. [peaceful music] Okay. So lucky to have had the chard and the kale. Ah, perfect. Sounds amazing. Oh, good morning sweetheart. Good morning, Mom. [Vivian] Hi sweetie. Thanks Gran. Oh, I'm so glad you liked it. I'm making more. Look at that, a quote on the refrigerator. We used to do this when I was a kid, Chloe. "There's no such thing in anyone's life "as an unimportant day." Oprah. [laughs] No. Alexander Woollcott. Okay, smart guy. It could've been Oprah. Yeah, it could've been. Well, you're in a good mood. Oh. We need a Christmas quote very soon. Oh, me. I'll do it. Oh. Oh, here's the last of this, sweetie, because I know you liked it so much. [playful music] All is going well. I'm settled in. [laughs] Yeah. It feels like freedom and it's glorious. Alright, we'll have lunch soon. Bye-bye. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but for what it's worth, freedom is glorious. [laughs] And what is freedom really? Oh, uh... freedom is being your own boss and freedom is not answering to anyone. Well, I've answered to people most of my life and I've always been free. Are... are you stuck? You wanna shop locally? Here. Roy and Stacy Chambers grow these organically. They are loaded with beta carotene and great flavor. -You don't want this. -Oh! -Here, take this. -Um... They're good for you. Enjoy. Thank you. Okay... bye everyone. Oh darling, you look wonderful. Oh, thanks. I won't be late. It's a work thing. Yeah, that dress just screams construction site. [Vivian] Chloe, come on, dinner. [Chloe] Coming, Grandma. [Ryan] ...But you didn't come back right away? No, I stayed out east. I loved it there and there were so many great job opportunities. Thank you. Um... it's only when I decided to have Chloe that I wanted to be closer to family. Ah... right. That makes sense. So what brings you to Bryson Falls? Well, my brother moved here a couple years ago with his family. They fell in love with the place, he said it felt like home. So I decided to give it a try. Give it a try? Is this a test? -No, it's not a test. -[Summer laughs] -Exactly. -Hmm. -Although maybe it is. -[Summer laughs] Oh, thank you. I, uh... I travel a lot for work. Hm. That must be tough. Yeah, it can be. But it's also good. New experiences. But then there's also lots of hotel living. It's a trade-off, you weigh it out. Do you make lists? You know, pros and cons? Yes. Totally make lists. How else are you supposed to make an informed decision? Exactly! Does your family give you a hard time about it too? All the time. But when you engineer bridges for a living... Yeah, nobody wants you to play it by ear. No. No. No surprises. Yeah, I'm not a fan. Although surprises seem to be working out for me this week. So, tell me about this winter carnival. Well, it's a benefit for the Bryson Falls Hospital. Yes. And everyone in town helps decorate the booths. There's a bake sale and cookie contest. Ah. And that's when we give away the toys from the drive. Mmhmm. Mm. There are games. And there's gotta be a Santa, right? Uh, yeah, you'd think except for that he was booked that day. Oh. So, um, all the volunteers are just gonna help give away the donated toys and I hope someone warned you that there is a costume for you. -Costume? Wait... -Yeah. You wear a costume? Oh no, no, no. I don't wear costumes. I bribed to stand in. You don't wear costumes, okay. Noted. Did you know that the town was gonna tear down Newlands and put in a box store? They were gonna put a box store down here? That is so wrong. Oh yeah, totally out of place. I mean... It's was crazy, but it took me so long to convince them that I could redesign the old store and fill it with way more shops than you could get in one of those boxy messes. Well you did some amazing work. -And that hardware store... -Mm. It has a really old foundation but I know if I could shore it up, I could turn it into... Sorry. I ramble. No, you're not rambling at all. I like listening to you talk. [laughs] [romantic music] That's beautiful. Yeah. [Summer] Let's look. See, it's things like this old gazebo. Why do you have to tear down things just 'cause they're old. You could keep what's good and fix the stuff you need to fix. I couldn't agree more. You know, you should run everything. [laughs] I think so too. Yeah, there are definitely a lot of possibilities here. I agree. So... That was fun. You sound surprised. [laughs] No, it's, it's okay. I mean, I was too. -I know what you mean. -Yeah, it was unexpected. -Exactly. -A nice surprise. -Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Of course. Yeah, thank you. Um... -Good night. -Good night. Good night. Okay. [magical music] [cheerful music] Oh, hey. We have a Christmas quote on the refrigerator. "The best way of spreading Christmas cheer "is singing loud for all to hear." Who do you think that is? Charles Dickens. Santa? It's Buddy the Elf. Oh right, Buddy. Yeah, that'd have been my second guess. Ladies, time to get going. Okay. [Vivian] What? Oh, she loves this bow. -[Chloe] I need to fix this. -[Vivian] Okay. Okay, well you both are gonna help Aunt April, Uncle Matt, right? A lot of decorating left to do. It looks great. What have you got there, Molly? Let's see. Oh. It should be a little more scattered, don't you think? I mean, they look like they're marching in formation. Yeah, but it's her vision, right? It's what Molly and April had in mind so we're gonna leave them to it. Well, alright. Alright April. [laughs] Okay. I have to go check with the catering company about tonight. Bye. Let's add a few more, just add a few more. [Molly] You go first, Grandma. [Vivian] Oh, thank you sweetheart. Oh. Hi. Hi. Um, wow, we've put you to work, haven't we? Ah, yeah. In fact, I noticed that your ticket booth was a little uneven so I put some lateral struts to really beef it up. Oh. If we ever get that snowstorm you're gonna be fine. I hope we do have that snowstorm. [chuckles] [playful music] -Are you seeing that? -Yeah, I am. Hold my gun. Hey, I, uh... had a really fun time the other night. -I did too. -Great. You're about to meet my sister. Hi. April this is Ryan Scott. Ryan, this is my sister, April Dutton. Nice to meet you. I heard you're in charge of the toy drive this year. You heard right. Well, my husband, he's not on the list but he put a donation box out at his office, 20 employees. Wow, that's... that's great. Uh, tell him to text me and we'll set up a drop off. Sounds perfect. Um... did you say it was okay for Mom to change all of your decorations? Oh, for five minutes. Uh, let me go. -Uh, nice to meet you, Ryan. -Nice to meet you. So that's your gang? Oh, yes, yes. I guess it is. Um, my sister and her husband and their kids. And my Mom and that's my daughter, Chloe. That is my gang over there. [Summer] Oh. [Ryan] My brother Chris, his wife, Melanie. That's, uh, Jason their son and, um, Emily is my niece. -[Summer] Aww. -[Ryan] Yeah. Okay, well, um, I am supposed to- Yeah, I should get back to... -But yeah, um... -Paint. Oh yeah, right, of course. Okay. -I'll, uh... -See ya. -See ya. Bye. You love caroling. I can't believe you didn't wanna go with Mom and the kids. Hey guys, one second. You know, it's good for her to have some alone time. Some, some grandma moments, you know? Hey. Um... I almost forgot to give you my business card. You can tell your husband to text me and, uh... we'll arrange the toy drop. Thank you. Yeah. And, uh... I'll see you around. Oh... yeah. Okay. Great. Okay. Bye. Thank you. Look at you. No. No, no. I approve. Okay. Just, nothing to see here. Move along. Move along. I mean, it was great but... There's just something... What, you're waiting for the anvil to fall out of the sky? I am. Okay, well, let's get you a helmet. Try and enjoy it. [telephone ringing] Sorry. She's still not answering. A text? Oh, she doesn't believe in them. Um... you know what, why don't I just look at it myself? -Great. -Okay. Gran, what is this supposed to be? Oh, that's an ice skating pond. But we don't have a pond in Bryson Falls. [laughs] No, not anymore. They drained it and built an artificial skating rink in the very same spot. People thought it was more practical. Why is Chloe wearing a boa? Because it's fabulous. [laughs] That it is. I'm gonna make one for all of us for our Christmas PJ's. Not a costumes girl. Mom doesn't do costumes. [Summer] Mom, you were supposed to meet me and the realtor at 2:30. [Vivian] Oh, I'm so sorry, honey. Yes, I forgot. Here... okay, I'll look this over. Can you please... But there's really great features in this one. [Summer] No long hallways. Okay, I said I'll look it over. There's no need to manage everything, Summer. Where do the batteries go? [magical music] Do you have any with lines? Uh... I have some. Hold on. Angie, I'm gonna need a diary, please. -Be right with you. -Okay. For all your secret thoughts? Oh... [laughs] No, for my daughter, Chloe. What about you? It's for my niece, Emily. It was on her Christmas list. Pro tip, get one with a lock. Really? She's eight. What could she possibly be writing about that's... you know what, I'm not gonna finish that sentence. It needs a lock. -Yeah. -Here's a bunch. Wow. That's a lot of choices. How do I choose? Uh... does Emily have a favorite color? She does, magenta. Mostly because I think she just likes saying the word "magenta". That's a good word. I don't even think I know what one is magenta. Uh, that one. Ah. Thank you. I'll take it. Oh, and I'll take this one for Chloe. Thank you. Perfect. -There you go. -Excellent, thanks. And here, uh... thank you so much. [Angie] Thank you. Thank you for making that so easy. Oh... sometimes it just is. Yeah. You, um, seem to be having a lot of fun with your family. I am. Being an uncle is great. Being an aunt is great too. All the fun, no tuition. Yeah, I finally get to make reindeer pancakes this year for Christmas morning. It's a family tradition. Buttermilk? What other kind is there? Good point. And then? In the afternoon we watch "It's a Wonderful Life" and we try to say the next line, and shout it out before everyone else. [laughs] That sounds fun. So what about you? Oh... uh, well we spend all day in our Christmas PJ's and then we switch over to ugly Christmas sweaters for dinner. Mmhmm. But I like the movie idea. Oh, feel free to borrow it. Ah, I will. So, um... you and your brother are close? Yeah, we are. We have some catching up to do. There was a time when I needed to put some distance between me and my dad and I didn't spend a lot of time with Chris. Oh. Why the distance? Uh... Dad can be tough. It's either his way or the highway. He knew exactly what I was supposed to do with my life and he wanted me to do the same thing he did and there was no way I was gonna do that. What did he want you to do? Be a civil engineer. But aren't you...? A civil engineer, yes. [laughs] And the worst part is, I love it. Ah, well that is terrible. [laughs] Yeah. I tried so many other things first. Did you, really? Uh-huh. I was a chef. I was a ski instructor. I even studied economics. But it turns out I had a talent for engineering and he was right. [laughs] I hate it when that happens. Yeah. Has that happened with your mom, Vivian? Oh yeah. My mom has a direct line of communication with the universe. Sends her memos and then she distributes the information. Well, uh... I really enjoyed chatting with you. Oh. Yeah, me too. I'll see you soon. Soon? * Do you think Mom is okay? Well, she definitely called me out when I told her she shouldn't have stairs in her place. [laughs] April... I can't believe you said that. Do you think maybe she could be sick? -No. -Okay. Definitely not. No, she wakes up at the crack of dawn to make those vile green juices. [laughs] She rearranges my kitchen and then she's busy all day with her friends or whatever. Yeah, well that's why she blew me off this afternoon. There's definitely something strange going on. Wait... [laughs] Wait, like, stranger than normal strange? Stranger. [laughs] Definitely stranger. Okay. I'm gonna suss out what is going on with Mom. -We'll figure it out. -Okay. Have you seen Ryan? Gulp. Um, yeah. I, uh, I ran into him today. Oh. And no anvils fell outta the sky. No. No... no anvils yet. Mmhmm. This is a conversation about Mom. I... that's all I have to announce at this moment in time. Did the painters update their schedule? I mean, Christmas Eve is only eight days away. We're on track for that. Hey Summer, do you have a place where I can stash these gifts? Yeah, I made a space for you over there. Thanks. Okay. Are we gonna have time to put art on the walls after the paint dries? [magical music] [Cliff] Shouldn't be a problem. [Summer] Cliff, you're a lifesaver. So I know that you are super busy but if you can take an hour one of the donations gave me an idea. Um... Trust me, it'll be fun. * -[Ryan] Got it? -[Summer] Yeah. -[Ryan] I'm right here. -[Summer] Yeah, sure. No problem. -[Ryan] Whoa. -[Summer] I'm just gonna sit down. Okay. Good idea. I can't believe I'm doing this, I haven't been on skates since I was 12 years old. Well, I'm sure it's just like riding a bicycle. That's easy for you to say. You were a hockey player, right? Yup. A little bit. But that was a long time ago. I can't remember the last time I was on the ice. And you just suddenly thought this was a good idea? Yeah, it surprised me too. Okay. I'm ready. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Sorry, sorry, sorry... Now, I'm ready. -Okay. -Okay. Okay. I might need to hold onto you. Is that okay? Of course. You're gonna find your edges in no time flat. [magical music] [Vivian] Chloe, come on, dinner. [Chloe] Coming Grandma. Ahh! Ahhhh!!! Whoa!!! [both laugh] I'm so sorry. That's okay, I got you. Oh! Here, let me help you. Okay. Alright. -I'll just... -Yeah, give me your hand. -Okay. -Okay. -Oh. -Oh. Wow, that was really graceful. Yeah, yeah. Do you need to take a break? No. It is a challenge now and I'm going to figure this out. Okay. I will not stand in your way. -Okay. Thank you. -Okay. Well, maybe if you could stand in my way, like, you know, just a little bit. I'm here for you. Don't leave me on my own. Okay. -Oh. -No. Thank you. Oh, this house. This house has been here since before I was born. Grandma, how does magic work? Well, that's a mystery for the ages. How will I know if it's working? Well, will you know when your wish comes true? I think so. There you go. Have you finished your homework? You used to be fun. [Vivian chuckles] [magical music] This was a wonderful surprise. Are you surprised by that fact? Totally. Well I hope you get used to it because that is just the beginning. I, uh... found plans for the old hardware store, and you're right, the foundation is a mess. But I just made this quick digital rendering of how we could use precast concrete to retrofit the foundation. I've never worked with this before. Could you do it? Mmhmm. I mean, will you be around? -Oh. -Uh. -I didn't... see I... -No, I... What I meant was... -No, not at all. -I didn't mean... I have time between jobs, so, yeah. But the city owns the building, right? You think you could sell them on this idea? -Oh, I will. -Okay. You know, you are way better at surprises than you thought. I'll take that as a compliment. You should. Most guys would've just come up with flowers or something. That would've been very disappointing. Nah, roses. They have nothing on a good schematic. -Hey. -Yeah. What do you think of that? I saw that too. -Do you think that we... -Absolutely. I mean, if we just blew out this wall... -Exactly. -We could just really expand. And we could put reinforcements right here and here. Oh. Chloe, what are you still doing awake? It's past your bedtime. In my defense, this is for school. [sighs] Okay. How was your day? [sighs] I know what's happening here but thank you for asking. I had a good day. In fact, I went skating today. You went skating, like ice skating? Mmhmm. It was super fun too. I fell but only one time which was pretty impressive. I think we should go again this weekend before the wreaths. Who'd you go with? Uh... well, I went with a friend. And as it turns out he's a good skater. So, is this a work friend or a "friend" friend? A bit of both, I guess. Anyway, uh, we have to wrap this conversation up. How much longer is your homework? Ten minutes? Okay. Ten more minutes and that's it. [Muah] Love you. [magical music] [fire crackling] [peaceful music] [sighs] But I don't have... Wait, I have more... Oh, these are Mom's. She's in trouble. No wonder. [cheerful music] Ooh, these are perfect. -They smell delicious, Grandma. -Mmhmm. -Good morning. -Isn't it, though? "Everything you can imagine is real." I guess, Walt Disney. Doctor Seuss. No. Pablo Picasso. That one's especially for you, Chloe. Imagine it and you can create it. [whispers] It's not that dark green, okay? Just down the hatch. [whispers] Not bad? I put some more apples in it so you wouldn't throw it out. Now you finish that and you can have a gluten-free Christmas cookie. Hey, that's not a bad deal. Mom. I need to talk to you for a minute. Mmm. This is so good. Not right now, sweetie, I'm late. Have a good day. Uh, no. We really do need to talk though, later. Hello. Hi. Wow. This is... Creative chaos. You know, not the kind of thing that freaks me out so much I can hardly breathe. Well, since you put it that way, is it okay if people drop off presents today? We can set up out front. That is a great idea. Basically I'm doing nothing except watch paint dry for the next 48 hours so I would love to help you. How about that? -Okay. -Good idea, huh? Okay. -So good. -Yeah. [Summer laughs] Oh, my gosh. -Hey, you two. -Hey. My car is full of toys. Would you mind unloading? I'll be right back. Great. Um, can you come over later? It's Viv. "Eureka" Viv or "five-alarm" Viv? At least five alarms. Okay, I'll text you. Yeah, thanks. So what's "five-alarm Viv"? A crisis but we'll be able to fix it. -Hmm. -What? Do you realize how much you do? What do you mean? Well, I mean... between your business, your daughter Chloe, your family, fixing what's broken in this town... Uh, I guess I just like to be in charge. Ask anyone. I mean, you don't have to downplay it. It's good. I mean, you have skill. You have a real skill. What about you? You do a lot. Your career, all that traveling you do. Yeah, but it's just me. You do a lot. Your life is a lot. I don't think it's that much. I mean, you know... I make it work. Yeah. Oh, sure. Thanks. Oh, hi. Hey. So, everyone wanted to contribute. Some of the kids in the hospital love to draw. -Aw, that's perfect. -Great, thank you so much. -Here, I'll take this. -No, no I'm okay. -You got it? -Yeah, I got it. Bye. [cheerful music] It's like a giant toy Jenga thing. Yeah, or a piñata. Now all we have to do is wrap them. Oh. Do you have the paper? We could get started. Oh, that's okay. You don't need to help with that, I got a bunch of volunteers coming on the 23rd and they need a job. Right. Of course. Uh, well, I'm starved. Do you wanna get some lunch? Oh. I, uh, I have a thing, so... Oh. Okay. Actually, do you wanna have dinner? On Tuesday? -Next week? -Yeah. Sure. Great. -Okay. -Great. [magical music] [reading] "For he'd been fast asleep all the year "and he'd polished up his pretty wings really shiny. "And then they went off... Mom... Get out of the way. "He showed his pretty wings and then they went off into the... You go away. You're gonna get me sacked. Now where were we with that little Spice? [Summer] Okay. "He danced along. "The magic dream man had found his dream." [April] You're sure she's broke? [Summer] And that's why she took a job at the daycare. Bingo. Do we just... dig in? I don't know. I'm starting to feel weird about it. Maybe we should only look at papers that seem financial. It's just a lot of colors. No labels or anything. But maybe that is her filing system, you know, the colors. Which color's finance, green? No, she would use chakra colors. Mm. Mmhmm. 'Kay. Well, there's gotta be something in here that's useful. No, not that. So frustrating. I mean, I had Mom all setup on auto pay, I don't know what happened. After Dad died I got it all worked out. You were 16. There was no auto pay. No, of course not. But you remember when the power went out? What was that, like six months after Dad died? Yup. She forgot to pay the bills and so I went to the bank and I helped work with them to figure something out so they'd pay it automatically and Mom approved it and that was that. Wait, why didn't I know any of that? You were young and it was handled. Then she gets involved with Merle and moves in with him and then she sells the house. I mean, she didn't sell it. She practically gave it away. Yeah, I still can't believe that. She said she didn't need the money. Well, in her mind, she didn't need the money. She had everything she needed. [sighs] Okay. Okay. So when I looked at that statement, it did show that she was receiving that retirement money every month. And then she also has that job, right, so that's a little bit of money. Yeah. [sighs] You know, it was really generous of her with the house. Yeah. Remember Christmas there? Of course, the best. She would put wreaths on each of our doors every year. Yeah, yeah. She always did Christmas well. Yeah. She said it's okay. She said she's ready for something new. Yeah, well, she needs a home. I know. What do we do? I don't know. [April sighs] I just don't know. [cheerful music] * Hi. [laughs] Hey. Hello. Hi. Shopping locally? [laughs] I actually just told my brother I'd come look at this house. You had to be talked into it? Well, I'm... I'm not really in the market. You? I'm window shopping. And then I'm going off for a glorious day with my grandchildren. We're gonna do our favorite Christmas project. That does sound glorious. Does it really? Does it to you? Oh yeah. Sure. But it is hard for me to imagine my life going that way. You know, that happening. I had my shot. It didn't work out. You know things do come in their perfect time. I tell you what... for now I'm gonna hold that vision for you until you can see it for yourself. Does that really work? All the time. Especially at Christmas. Oh, she's a beauty, isn't she? Yeah. [upbeat holiday music] [April] Ugh, I've been thinking about it all night. [summer] Ugh, me too. We have an attached garage, we could turn it into an apartment for her. Wait. Slow down, April. You're skating too fast. Sorry. I... don't think that's a good idea. It would be so expensive. We just need to find a place for Mom to rent. Yeah, but can she even afford that? I don't know but she can stay with us until we figure something out. Or not if you want anything to happen with Ryan. -[gasps] April! -What? [Chloe] Mom! Mom, look. Oh yeah. Get it, Chloe. [Chloe] Wanna see it again? [both] Yes. [laughs] [Summer] Yes! Sorry, sorry. I'm good, I'm good. You obviously did not get your ice skating skills from me. No. She clearly got them from me. [laughs] Yeah. Alright. I think I have everything on the table but if you need anything else just holler. Okay Wyatt, time's up. Let's see some Christmas spirit if you want screen time later. I'm totally full of Christmas cheer. Ugh. Can I put some black ribbon on mine? No. Well, of course you can. If that's what you feel. The rules in this house are, there are no rules. So whatever you feel about Christmas, go on, express it. It's all good. Just start expressing with the rest of us, Wyatt. You got a Christmas village? [Chloe] Yeah, Grandma brought it. Wow. Is this Grandpa Todd's old village? I haven't seen this in years. What does it do? Oh, nothing. [Chloe] Nothing we know of. Does it play music or light up? -[Summer] No. -[April] Sometimes. [Vivian & Chloe] Yes. Let's plug it in. Oh, there are no plugs. There are no lights or anything. Well, there must be batteries. I know I saw it lit up. What did you wish for? Did I wish for anything? I don't remember. It was Christmas. You must've wished something. [April] You're right. [Summer] Hey, everyone. Our song is on. [all singing] * On the first day of Christmas, * * my true love gave to me * * a partridge in a pear tree * * On the second day of Christmas... * * Okay everyone, get upstairs and brush your teeth. Come on. Go, go, go. Come on, Chloe. [children laughing] Oh, thank you so much. "The great thing about getting older "is that you don't lose all the other ages that you have been." Do you know? I remember that one. It was the "Wrinkle in Time" author. Madeleine L'Engle and that was one of my favorite all-time books. That's because the heroine is just like you. Aww. Here's to a perfect day. -Cheers. -Cheers. Okay, so Mom... we need to talk about your situation. [laughs] I don't have a situation. I've worn out my welcome? -No. -No. -No, not at all. -No, Mom. Mom, it's just that I'm worried... [children chattering in the distance] Ah... I will handle this. Thank you so much. Kids... You're supposed to be brushing your teeth. You worry enough for everyone. You took a job at the daycare and you didn't even tell us. Of course I'm worried. Why do I have to tell you? I was a teacher for 30 years. Right. Every time you say worry, I think I failed to teach you anything about how to live a life. April and I just wanna understand your financial situation. So you can, what, worry more? No. So that we can help you. We're trying to help you find the perfect house. You don't wanna miss out because you weren't checking out the right opportunity, you weren't looking at every house. That is not gonna happen. This is all gonna come together in its own perfection. Yeah sure, okay. If you could just give me some guidance, some limits, how much can you afford? Will you please stop worrying about me? This need you have to manage. It's exhausting, Summer. You spend so much time fixing things, you don't have any time to just look, to see. The universe fixes things for you? You know how it does that? I do it. Ever since Dad died I have been the one cleaning up after you. You like to talk about how life is this big, beautiful buffet. And yeah, I guess maybe it is, but someone has to make sure that the check gets paid. You think I wouldn't have loved to have been a normal teenager who just thinks about school and prom and boys and I didn't have to worry? No. No, I don't think you would've loved it. I may not pay every bill on time but I am responsible for my life and I believe in a little Christmas magic too. I'm sorry, my sweet darling, that you aren't capable of believing. Nobody asked you to be my keeper. Summer? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just... just... here. Please, just give me a minute. Merry Christmas. [peaceful music] [Chloe] Mom, you did a quote? "I have not failed. "I just found 10,000 ways that don't work." Elon Musk? Oh. That is a really good guess. Thomas Edison. And then he invented the lightbulb. Is Gran coming back? She's just visiting your Aunt April and your cousins. Mom, it's been four days. Yeah, well there are a lot of them. Listen... Chloe, would you be okay if Grandma came to live with us? Yes, of course. Aren't you sad that she's gone too? Yeah. I am. I could make one of her famous shakes for us to make us feel better. No, thank you. [phone ringing] Oh, just a second. Hello? [Ryan] Hi. Morning. I hope it's not too early to call. No. Not at all. Um, we still on for tonight? Yeah. Yeah, I think... I think so. Good. Um, DeLuca's okay again? Sure. Whatever you want. [Ryan] I mean, we could try something else, um... whatever you want. Well, why don't you surprise me? You're better at it than you think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am. -Um, hey, uh... -[Chloe clears throat] [Ryan] There's actually something that... Uh, I'm so sorry. I, um, I have to get going. Okay. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Okay. Nothing to see here. Turn around. Move along. [app] Your anger is in formation. Every mistake is an opportunity. So breathe into that. Go back to that moment you'd most like to take back. Hey! [app] See yourself... Oh! I'm sorry, I had to say hi. -Oh hi, good morning. -Good morning. I didn't mean to interrupt your... meditation? No, that, that's fine. I'm just waiting for a shopping date. And my meditation is such a challenge today. Oh, not the vision for you. No, that's easy. You're gonna be fine. I'm certain of that. Well, that's good to hear 'cause the jury is still out on it, um... [Vivian] Ah-ah-ah-ah... So, what's the challenge with your...? Me? Forgiveness. I'm not sure I can find it. Huh. Well, how about I, uh... hold onto that for you like you did for me. [laughs] That's a deal. I'll take all the help I can get. Well, we all could. Good to see you. You too. [app] From there, you want to forgive. [app] Can you forgive yourself? [app] Settle in. Feel your feet on the ground. -Mom. -Ooh. There you are. -Sorry I'm late. -Oh you're not, it's fine. Have you called Summer back? No. I think she needs some space. That's not what I hear, but... Well, then maybe it's me. -Oh. -What? It's both of you. I get whiplash sometimes. You are so much alike and neither of you gets it. You think Summer tries to control everything? No wonder I couldn't meditate today. And shopping isn't gonna help. No. I've gotta clear out all the bad energy first. Oh, I'm sorry sweetie. We'll take a little rain check. Oh... muah. I love that house. The whole thing was ugly and then I ugly cried afterwards. My mother took all of her stuff and went to April's and I haven't heard from her since. Hm. That was a lot. I hear that now. It's possible that I don't know how dating works. Don't worry about it, I'm a... I'm a good listener. I'm so sorry. No, no. I think we skipped all the dating protocol the first time we met. Right, but even still, I should not unload my entire family drama on you. It's okay. For at least a month, right? First we have to know each other's favorite movies and what books changed your life. The worst breakup ever. Okay. Well, worst breakup. There's actually only one, one major one. Really? Yup. My divorce. It was rough. How long ago? If you don't mind my asking. No, it's okay. It was a few years ago. No one was to blame. We got married too young and I actually think we... we both knew right away. It was still hard to let go though. I'm sorry. Don't be. I... I learned a lot from it. We don't have to do this. Trade secrets, you know? We can just enjoy spending time together for as long as it lasts. Yeah. [laughs] You do look relieved. I am relieved. I really am. I'm sorry I've been all over the map with you. I, um... I guess, I just got offered a job, a really good job. -Oh. -Full time. But it's in California. Wow. Congratulations. Thanks. Boy, I wish you worked. [cheerful music] Well, look who it is. I was just thinking about you. Funny, you don't look like a stalker. Well neither do you. Wow. What army are you feeding? My daughter and her family. -Ah. -And you? Oh, my brother and his family are doing Christmas this year. I'm just a guest. That's nice. And after that you're nuking for one? Well, I'm only in town for one more week. I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, I'm uh, I'm sure I'll pass through again at some point. So, uh, giving up on the vision, eh? No, uh... I'm... I'm not giving up. I'm... I guess I'm just accepting. Not all of us can have a cart full of food. My life is good, I've been lucky enough, but I guess you just... well, I don't know. You get to a point and well that's it, life is set. There are worse things. Well, hallelujah, it must finally be snowing. Because that is the biggest snow job I've heard in years. You are not done. Things can change. You can change. Nothing is set unless you want it to be. At any age. Forgetting that... that's the worst thing. Second worst thing? Skipping greens. Here. At least put a salad with those pathetic little things. Well, if I don't see you again, safe travels. Merry Christmas. Yeah. Merry Christmas. [magical music] [Summer] Are we ready to check the sound? Hit it. [Christmas jazz music playing] That's great. Maybe it needs to come down a little. We should maybe check the level in the corners. Good idea. * -Hey. -Hi. Having fun yet? Ask me tomorrow. You? Yeah, we've found presents for all the kids on the list. Well, that is a Christmas miracle. Do you need any help? No, no I am all set. Hey, it's gonna be fine. -Hey. don't worry. -I'm not worried. I'm sorry. That wasn't for you. They told me you were in here. I'm working. You should take a break. All you need is 10 deep, cleansing breaths- Mom. I'm sorry. Okay? I know that I was outta line. Don't. Don't. I've thought a lot in the last couple of days about you and me. And how very lucky I've been to have you in my life especially after your father died. Oh, you were so strong. And I was... spinning. Well, Mom... You know I was never gonna let you fall. Because that's who you are. The thing is, is that... I really haven't really been scared like that since then. But I know I put myself in this position and, so... the only way out is through. I've decided to take the plunge. Here. Here's all my financial stuff. Stuff. Well, papers and documents and things. It's okay, Mom. It's not my business. I made it your business so you have every right to look at it. It's all there. I'm an open book. It's not enough. Well... I'll be fine. It just grieves me to think that you lost one moment of joy in your beautiful life because you thought you had to take care of me. I don't want that anymore, Summer. No, that's why I wanted you to see this, and to know that I will be just fine. And you do not have to worry about me anymore. Okay? I want that to be your mantra. Okay. Okay. Does this mean you'll come home now? Your Christmas wreath is still hanging from your bedroom door. [laughs] That's one of the best ones I've done in a while. I mean, the ombre and the holly leaves. Boy, they just popped. I love you, Mom. I love you more, my baby. [Summer] Keep that safe, okay? I am. I am so proud of you. My daughter is a gifted and extraordinary woman. Yes, she is. Oh, hello. You're... Vivian. Is this the man you've been kept so busy with lately? Why am I behind in this conversation? Ryan Scott, this is my mother, Vivian Todd. Well, how do you do. It is a pleasure. [laughs] This is remarkable. Isn't the universe grand? [laughs] Merry Christmas. [laughs] Um... I cannot believe that is your mother. No, no, no. You have to explain to me what just happened. Let's just say your mom is a trip. Oh boy. No, no. I mean nothing bad, all good. But she got you to tell her all your secrets? 'Cause that is her superpower. Not exactly but she definitely has a vision for me. Of course she does. Hey everyone, thank you so much for your help. I'll see you tomorrow? I'll be there with the costumes. Great. You do good work. Aw, thanks Cliff. You probably need to get some sleep. I'm gonna take you and the crew out next week to say thank you. You've been great. It's been a pleasure. We're all happy to see this place come back. -Good night. -Good night. So, what would you say if I asked you to go on a walk? [magical music] She's just this bigger than life person, you know? And, uh, I guess it was just really something. But you and Vivian are good now? She's gonna be her fabulous bossy self by tomorrow and hopefully I'll just worry a little less. That sounds like a good start. Of course she still doesn't have a place to live. Right. And she doesn't have enough money to live on. Actually, I don't even know that. 'Cause you know what? I'm not in control anymore. Do you really believe that? Yeah. And you know what? I'm okay with it. Let those chips fall where they may. [laughs] -I'm just gonna let 'em. -Yeah. We're gonna see what happens. Yeah, I can relate. My brother always says I'm so busy. Too busy to stop and take it all in. -I get that too. -Yeah. Makes me wonder what I'm missing. Yeah. Yeah, me too. -Yeah. -Yeah. Okay. Good night. Good night. [cheerful music] [Chloe] I wish for... The best Christmas ever. I mean, I wouldn't be caught dead in a costume but it does look adorable on you. And I can't believe you made this all yourselves. Hey. What's up? Wyatt's in charge over at the hot chocolate bar. And where are April and Vivian? They should be here soon. Love the boa. Thanks. What are they up to? -You look great. -Thanks. Mom... [Ryan] I wouldn't know. It's him. [Summer] You know everything. Mom. What? Who is that? Oh. Uh, that's the guy who's running the toy drive this year. Sorry. Just one sec. You know him? Yeah. He's a nice man. Chloe, what is going on with you? -Hi, Summer. -Oh, hi. -Hi -Uh, wow, it fits you great. Thanks. Thanks. Uh, you must be Matt Dutton? Ryan Scott, pleasure to meet you. I know your brother, Chris. Welcome to town. Thank you. And who is this pretty little elf? This is my daughter, Chloe. Chloe, say hi. -Hi. -Hi. I need chocolate. -Now? -Right now. It's early. Mom, please. You have no idea. Okay. What was that? I'll go with her. What? I hope it was okay meeting Chloe like that. Of course, it's fine. She knows you're a friend. She doesn't have any... expectations. Summer, I feel badly about the conversation we had the other day. Oh, you shouldn't. No, not at all. It's just there's some things to say. It's okay, believe me. I... Ryan? Ryan, it's time to start. Oh... Have you seen Bridget? No, I haven't. I haven't. Great. Just great. She's supposed to be dressed already. The kids are getting restless. Right. I'll, um, I... You should go. -Yeah. I... -Yeah, the kids. -Um... -It's Christmas. Maybe we can talk later? Okay. Summer, I found it! The realtor came by this morning and we had the best bid. Your father had a pension at the university. I didn't know I could take that. What? I didn't even think of that. And we had some money for the down payment, which we will take out in babysitting. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. And you'll be happy to know, I figured it out myself. I can cover the monthly mortgage payments. So we grabbed it. Her dream home. The one you showed me. The one on the corner? Yes, and it's perfect. I could just see all of my things in it. You did it yourself, Mom. I did it. I did it myself and without you worrying. [laughs] Wow. Congratulations. Oh, you see, my darling. You can see what happens when we let go of our comfort zone. Own what you want, Summer, and then let the universe bring it to you. I will. That's right. I... I have to go. [inspirational music] * [Ryan] Hey everybody. Santa left me in charge because he is a very busy guy. Summer, what's going on? ...but he has some presents and I'm going to hand them out. So Claudia, if you could give me a hand? [Summer] I can't believe I'm doing this. Come on. This is Kelly. Hi Kelly. I heard you were a very good girl this Christmas and I have something special for you. [playful music] I'm gonna need your help. Merry Christmas. Alright. Come here. I know I said it didn't matter. And, um... I meant it. That I would just enjoy whatever we had for as long as it lasted. Except for... except for that I lied. [children gasp] I know. Lying is really bad and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And maybe it's just me. And if it is, that's okay. Never mind. But I sorta thought that maybe you thought that we had something special happening here too. Oh, hi. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Uh, hold on. Um, I have something special for you. Uh... uh... Here you go. Merry Christmas. Okay. Summer, you don't have to... Because it's scary. It, it is, by the way. But my life is in order. It's all set. But what scares me now is you leaving without me ever saying, please stay. Because that is what I want. And Mark is here. Summer. I, uh... Here you go little buddy. Summer. Listen, I... I want us. And I know it's hard for you because of everything that you've been through but it'll be different this time because you're different. And I'm definitely different. And I think it could be spectacular and fun and quiet and loud. And I think it could be like a little bit of Christmas magic every single day. Or maybe just... a lot of fun. I just... I really wanna take that chance. [romantic music] [camera shutters snap] I wanna give it a chance too. [laughs] You know, people make long distance relationships work all the time and I... I called them and I turned down the job in California. I was trying to tell you but between the presents and the kids, I didn't... And me bursting out on stage in this outfit. You know you didn't have to wear a costume but I'm glad you did. [applause] * [Chloe] One more Christmas wish. Best Christmas ever. [gasps] [sighs] [Ryan] Here we are. [Summer] So... [Ryan] Wow. -This is the village. -It's big. Yeah, it's nice, isn't it? [gasps] [Summer] Wow. [magical music] [Ryan] Here. Yeah. * * * * * * * *
