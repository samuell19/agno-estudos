When I was a child... I remember seeing a big rainbow over the river. Go away! At that time my mother told me. "A rainbow is the door to heaven. When people die they go to heaven through that door". When I was a child my father passed away. And my mother went abroad. I wanted my mom to remarry but she didn't want to. My name is Ji-hae and my blood type is O. And since I was seven I learned taekwondo. Are you okay? This box contains my parents' letters and diaries. Every time my mother read the letters, she wept. The refined letters and the scent of the past... My mom's first love is in here. Hello? Ji-hae? It's me, Soo-gyung. Why are you calling so early? Wanna go to the art museum and a play with me and Sang-min? Hey, are you making me tag along? No, dummy! Sang-min asked you to come. Really? - I'm serious. - I got to know. Sang-min through Soo-gyung. She one day asked me to write e-mails to Sang-min. For two months, I wrote letters to him for Soo-gyung. Today, I saw you reading a book by the bench. It looked like a picture in a postcard. That's childish. Rewrite it? No, I like it I like it being childish. If you still want to marry I'll give you a curse for a dowry. Sang-min, I sent you a letter without missing a day. Afterwards, Soo-gyung signed up for theater. So that she could get close to him. Good-bye If you still want to marry marry an idiot instead. The night stained with pain kept me awake... The gloomy moonlight has unexpectedly made your shadow suspend on my window. No, that's not it! The gloomy moonlight has unexpectedly made your shadow suspend on my window Jordan is touched when Emily comes back to see him. You have to feel both happy and heartbroken. Do it with more feeling! When I look at him I feel breathless. But he never once looked at me I'll put a spell on him. Look back! Look back! Look back! Hey! Music. When I saw you for the first time you already stole my heart. But now that you came to me. I feel like we'll be together forever. Good. My heart is yours forever. He doesn't make a lot of gesture. Isn't Sang-min fantastic? I love guys who are into their work. Saw him? "No, that's not it!" The gloomy moonlight has unexpectedly made your shadow suspend on my window. Talking about me? It's nothing, Sang-min. You know Ji-hae, right? She was with me when I first came here. Right, it's been a while. Yes... Hello. A lot of girls like him. Not just Soo-gyung. Even the woman working at the student's hall likes him. Sung Joo-hee. Yoon Tae-soo. Oh Joon-ha? "When I opened the window this morning the romantic breeze signaled autumn coming I'll put that wind in the letter and send it to you". Romantic breeze? That's so cliché. I guess I'll look at it as a classic. Oh Joon-ha! Tae-soo came to me all of sudden whom I've never talked to. Please write me a letter. He heard the rumor that I write for others. Tae-soo is a friend who grew no less than 36 centimeters during the winter vacation. To who? To my fiancée. Fiancée? She's my dad's friend's daughter. They set us up on their own. You're lucky. You don't have to ask girls out on dates. I'm sick of it. I'm not the type to date one girl. If she mails me he wants to check it. He wants to know everything. He acts just like a FBI agent. Oh no. She's pretty, huh? But since she's a congressman's daughter she'll be shallow. Drive! Drive! You let them slip out between your legs. City boys are slow. Suwon isn't a city, Seoul is. Oh Suwon... But we have a city hall. You catch them and I'll draw them. Look carefully, idiot Let's go. What are you doing? She's Old SUNG's granddaughter I heard she's from Suwon. - Wait, you're from Suwon, right? - Yeah. We can never dream of having her Old SUNG's son is a congressman. So she's a congressman's daughter. Then is she a congressman's son, idiot? - Oh... - She's... - She's waving. - Let's wave back! Hey, wave! - Hello! - Hi! I found one! Let me see! Let's see. It stinks. I got one. It's a big one. It sure ate a lot of cow shit. It's a beetle. A beetle? But I've never seen one. Do you want this? You wanna bet? It's cow shit, it's dirty. Have you seen the haunted house across the river? What? Yes. Can you take me there? Yes. Do you know how to row? Sure. Then let's meet at the ferry at twelve tomorrow, okay? - What did you say to her? - She said something... City boys are surely different. Hey, teach me how to row! You'll teach me, right? Grandpa told me a lot about it but forbid me to go. It's strict where ever I go. I really wanted to go, but I had no one to take me. If I ask the people here then they'll tell my Grandpa right away. But the boat isn't moving. Gosh! To be honest this is my first time rowing. My name is Oh Joon-ha. Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself I'm Sung Joo-hee. You're from Suwon? Yes I'm from Suwon, too I came here to visit my Uncle. Really? What a coincidence. Or maybe fate? - Pardon? - Oh, nothing. Is there... really a ghost? Have you seen... a ghost before? Of course Every day. What? In the mirror. Actually, I'm a ghost. Stop it. - Are you okay? - Yes. I think I sprained my ankle. Get on my back. Hurry and get on my back. It's a shower It'll stop soon. Dry yourself with this. When the rain stops we'll go along the river. Then we'll reach the ferry Although it's a bit far. I'm heavy, huh? Nope You're not heavy at all. But I weigh a lot And I eat a lot, too. Don't worry I can carry you on my back and go anywhere! You're lying I'm not lying. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I caught it. Open your hands. Hold the firefly for a moment. You gave me a firefly and carried me. But this is all that I can give you in return. Please give me the firefly. Thanks for today. She was sick for a few days and left for a big hospital in Seoul. After her mother died she got really sick. But when she came back from the countryside I heard she got healthier and looked happier. It's done. Let me see. It was painful to write the letters for Tae-soo. Because of her. I had a lot to tell her myself. It's great. Can I thank you by showing you my specialty? Yes. Wait a sec You have to open your mouth. When we close our mouths people will think we faked it. Watch carefully. Know what song this is? "Moonlight of Shilla"? You punks! Why haven't you finished your chores? Are you bastards playing hooky? I'll check later so make it spotless! And what's this smell? Did someone take a shit here? Joon-ha! Oh Joon-ha! Oh Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Oh Joon-ha! Are you crazy to scream in a library? Look, it's an invitation. Is everyone here Oh Joon-ha? Nosey bastards. Thank you. Next is sophomore Sung Joo-hee. She will play Beethoven's Sonata 8 on the piano. Welcome with warm applause. Joo-hee, you must be hungry I bet you're hungry. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Is your ankle better? Yes. And your cold? Yes I was very worried about you. And I enjoyed your performance. I have to practice more. Everyone's waiting I snuck out. I still have the firefly. It's in good health, like me. Hi. Sorry, I'm late. Mmm... Hi, Ji-hae. Sang-min, I won We made a bet I bet you'd come and Sang-min bet you wouldn't. You have to treat dinner. Okay, I will. What are you looking at? I have to go. Why are you going so early? Sang-min is treating us to dinner. Three's a crowd. You bad girl You're too smart. Sang-min! Ji-hae said she's leaving. But you should eat with us. And we can talk about the play, too. Ji-hae never changes her mind. Right, Ji-hae? Right. See? That's too bad It would've been nice if you came. Ever seen Sang-min treat anyone like this? He's doing this because you're my friend. He's just being nice so you can go, It's okay. Wait! I bought presents today I also got you one, so you wouldn't feel alone. I bet you won't be able to sleep tonight This isn't like Sang-min. It's because you're a good friend. If it wasn't for me you'd never get this. Pick one. Ji-hae! Ji-hae... I like your present better. It's okay to switch, right? Bye! "When the sun shines on the sea, I think of you. When the dim moonlight is on the spring I think of you". Really? Is that what it says? Gee! Oh my gosh Sang-min must really like me a lot. You have to give it to me tomorrow, okay? Okay. I have no reason to see him anymore. He wants to be with Soo-gyung now. When the sun shines on the sea... When the dim moonlight is on the spring... Are you done? Wait a little longer. Hand in your manure in an envelope after lunch. - Got it? - Yes, sir. Those who didn't bring it hurry and go take a shit! Got it? Let's get together! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! Joon-ha I'll close my eyes and run so you guide me, okay? I'm really closing them. Okay. Joon-ha. Wanna come with me to learn the folk dance after class? Folk? I'm gonna meet Joo-hee there. It's my dad and his friend's idea. They want us to meet at a healthy recreation. A lot of girls will be there so you pick one up. - Gonna come, right? - I don't know. Tae-soo! Joo-hee, this is my friend Oh Joon-ha. She's the one I told you about. I'm Oh Joon-ha Nice to meet you. Hello Are you two friends? Know each other? No, we don't. He's my best friend. This is my friend, Na-hee. Hi, I'm Na Na-hee - I'm YOON Tae-soo. - I'm Oh Joon-ha. Everyone please have a seat. Come on! Anywhere is fine. Today I will teach you the folk dance. - Sounds fun, right? - Yes. Folk Dance is... I missed you. Me, too. I didn't know you were Tae-soo's friend. I want to be a woman anchor. So I always practice my speech. Can you do this? Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Did I do okay? I can do it faster Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Shall I do it faster? Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Give it a try Peter Piper a pecked of peppers pickled... You'll need a lot of practice Repeat precisely after me Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. We should split up now I'll take Joo-hee home so you take care of Na-hee. Okay? See you later. I had fun Good night. Bye, Joo-hee. Good night. What are you doing? Let's get going. Joon-ha then try something easier. Try this. She sells seashells by the seashore. Easy, huh? Give it a try. Pardon? I said give it a try. Give what a try? She sells seashells by the seashore. Give this a try I can't Please don't ask me to. You can't do this? She sells seashells by the seashore. It's easy. She sells seashells by the seashore. - Have a good... - Yes... Good-bye. The card. I should've known there'd be a card for me. Ji-hae? Oh, hello. Where are you headed? To the library. That far? It's not far I won't get so wet if I stop at each building. Then I'll take you there. With my special umbrella. Think of that building as a shed and run. One, Two, Three! How are you? Thanks so much. But you're soaked I was going to get wet anyway. I should be going Thanks again. - Okay, I'll see you later. - Okay! I didn't think we'd meet again. But why does the library have to be so close? She hasn't mailed me back yet. - Joo-hee? - Yeah. - Why not? - I don't know. I'm not the type to fall in love with one girl. But I must really like her. Tae-soo! Tae-soo! Tae-soo? Hi. What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. Please take these flowers. I like you, Joo-hee. Please write to me. It's so strange Is it because I'm too tall? Why do I keep fainting? I'm out of breath. It's because of Tae-soo, right? What do you think I should do? Tell me. Tae-soo is a rotten bastard. No, Tae-soo is nice. He's a rotten bastard because he's too nice. Tae-soo is waiting for your letter. There's no hope. There's nothing we can do for us. Don't say that. There's a way. No, there's nothing more we can do. Nothing. We'll only get hurt. It'll work out. I won't see neither you nor Tae-soo anymore. I'm serious. I won't see anyone. Hey, limousine boy! Come here. Limousine boy! Forgot to bow? So you don't wanna bow is that it? If you have a chauffeur you don't have to bow, huh? Your badge is upside down and your shirt's unbuttoned. Fine, today I'll give you the worst beating ever. I'm gonna beat you all starting from the left. The first one gets hit once the second one gets hit twice. From the third shout out your turn. - Got it? - Yes, sir. - You sissies, I can't hear you! - Yes, sir! Seven. Stay still! - Ouch, my back. - Stay still, or I'll break your arm. You get one more beating Get into position! Listen to what I said and get into position! What's the count? I said what's the count? Then I'll tell you You're nineteen. One. Two. Three! Hey, get up! Get up! Hey, Hey! What's wrong with you? It's about Joo-hee. I don't think she likes me. I gave her flowers and even kissed her but there's no response. You kissed her? Yeah. When the sun shines on the sea I think of you. When the dim moonlight is on the spring I think of you. Take this and go home Stay out of the rain. Dummy. Do you want to get electrocuted? You're crazy. I don't want to split up like this. Let's talk just for a moment. Nothing can change. There's no use in talking Let go of me! Here's your letter I don't want it anymore. Why? There's no response and because of my conscience I'll write it myself from now on. And tell her the truth. It's a golden opportunity I heard she's very sick from the rain. So she's in the hospital. She's very sick? Because of the rain? Yeah. I'm going to see her. If I visit her when she's sick then I can score I'll confess to her that I didn't write the letters. I won't tell her it was you. Actually I'm not the type to like one girl but I really like her. Oh Joon-ha! Oh Joon-ha! He's calling you. Yes? Twenty four, twenty seven Thirty, thirty two... I have to eat all this? Look at this. Maw worms, intestinal worms hookworms, roundworms... You have everything What the hell did you eat? Because of you our class has the most parasites. But sir it wasn't my manure. Then whose was it? You're the only one who'd have this many parasites, Eat it now! YOON Tae-soo. Eat three. But it's the same manure. Yeah, but some spots have more parasites and some don't. How'd you know I was here? Why are you covering your face? Stop it, I haven't washed my face, and it's dirty. But you're still pretty. - How'd you know I was here? - I heard from Tae-soo. Why are you laughing? I heard you ate 32 worm-killing pills. Tae-soo, that bastard has a big mouth. Did he say anything else? After being silent for a while that's all he said and left. - Really? - Yeah. He's so odd. - Are you very sick? - Yeah. I'm sorry. I must be really stupid. Besides liking you I'm not good at anything else. No, there's a lot you're good at. Like getting drenched and eating worm pills. Don't laugh This is serious. I have to tell Tae-soo about us. Then we can clear our conscience. See you later. Is this her room? My poor daughter-in-law! How'd you get so drenched? No, lie down. A cold can't be taken lightly You can catch pneumonia. So, are you eating well? You should eat well to recover. I'm sorry This must be the wrong room. Wrong room. Clench your fists. Raise them like this. Now hit me. Why should I hit you? Hurry and hit me! I don't like hitting people or getting hit. My dad hit me too many times I like Joo-hee. Actually, she gave me this necklace last summer. Are you okay? Damn it I've fallen again. Don't worry. And don't let my dad see that necklace. He'll get furious. That necklace was a gift from my dad. To Joo-hee. Oh Joon-ha! It's your letter! Later on, we went on school break. And I thought I couldn't see her again I miss you I miss you so much I'll die. And I'm curious how much our river has changed. Say hi to our haunted house the shed, and our row boat. Say that I miss them and that I'm doing okay. Yesterday, Tae-soo came to me with your Uncle's address. He also confessed a shocking thing to me. That you were the one who wrote the letters to me. How could you hide that from me? Anyway, it's okay I almost threw away those letters but now I can read them again and think of you. Tae-soo also made a suggestion. That you put Tae-soo's name on the letters you send me. Then my parents will think that I'm exchanging letters with him. Look outside the window. If the branches swing gently in the wind then the one you love is loving you, too. Right now it's snowing outside. When it first snows they say you should stroll with your beloved. But I'm just writing a letter. Joon-ha, I miss you so much I'm going to get permission to go to Grandpa's house. If I do I'll send you a telegraph. Open your ears. If you hear your heartbeat then the person you love is loving you, too. Close your eyes. If there's a smile on your lips then the person you love is loving you, too. I want to send a telegraph. Then please sign up here. Okay. But fate must not be on my side. One of my letters was returned back to Tae-soo's home. Joo-hee is in love with Joon-ha. I'm not in love with Joo-hee. Both of them really love each other. So that's why I gave up. Two people in love should be together. It's okay with me. No, I love her, too. I won't give up. Are you mocking me? You always want things your way! So your parents mean nothing to you? Do you know who she is? She's a congressman's daughter! Know what that means, you punk? You deserve to die. You can't even hold on to a girl. It was the end of a winter break? I had hoped so much for. Know what this is? A belt? No, it's a whip. This bastard hits me. My dad doesn't want it to but it keeps wanting to hit me. That's why I caught it How should I punish it? The death penalty. That's exactly what I thought. Kill it slowly and painfully? Or starve it slowly to death? Or give it sleeping pills? Strangle it to death. Good idea. Joon-ha. Take good care of Joo-hee. Tae-soo! Somebody help! A person's dying! Tae-soo, you bastard! Tae-soo, you bastard! Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on! Someone help me! Somebody's dying! Tae-soo! Tae-soo! I told you to kill the belt not yourself. Tae-soo, wake up! Open your eyes! Don't die. Don't die Don't die, you bastard! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you bastard! Go inside. If you're with him he'll wake up faster. Hurry. Wait here for me. Hurry and get well. Ji-hae, know what this is? An umbrella? A very special umbrella. They're all the same. It's special because Sang-min gave it to me. He must know that I like him. Thought he wouldn't when you stare at him everyday? Go give this to Sang-min. No, you give it to him I'm not going there. Why not? Did you and Soo-gyung fight? Remember when it suddenly rained that day? Sang-min was drinking coffee here. He was looking out of the window then suddenly turned to me and said. "Did you bring an umbrella?" And then I said "I was worried I didn't". He placed his umbrella here and said "You can have it". He said he was okay to get wet. And then he ran off in the rain. Did you bring an umbrella? You can have it. It's raining a lot outside. Sang-min might be getting soaked without an umbrella. This is a really special umbrella I'll give it back to him. Did you bring an umbrella? Of course, I did. Really? But still, take mine. Is she crazy? You have an umbrella but why are you so soaked? It's not mine I came to return it to you. You left it at the store. I'm not the only one who gets wet even with an umbrella, am I? Don't go. You already know... my feelings. Now, you know it all. Yeah when I saw you run without an umbrella. I left my umbrella behind. Even on the day of the play. I wanted to give you a present so I bought Soo-gyung's, too. And if fate was on my side. I thought you'd pick the gift with the card in it. I thought we'd grow distant if I confessed my feelings I wanted to say that I liked you, but I couldn't I'll come see the play. Look I cut my wrists. I saw it all Both of you whispering love. Do you really love her? Is it really so? I'm working out my feelings. My eyes were looking straight but my heart was confused. Can I trust those words? Can I think of it as a promise? Yes. There's only one that I love. That one is me, right? Yes, I love you. I swear that I love you I love you, too. Sang-min I love you so much. Sang-min! What the hell are you doing? I didn't even finish my lines and then you call out my name? You can't just change your lines like that. You ruined everything! Sang-min, I wasn't acting it was my true feelings I love you Love is more important than a play I love you. After the play Sang-min and I went on a date. We decided to go to the river where my mother's memories lay. Joo-hee? No, I'm her daughter My name is Ji-hae. Is that so? I must've made a mistake. But you look so much like your mom. I delivered a lot of your mom's letters. Thank you, sir. I know well what happened to my parents afterwards. Students and citizens! This is illegal demonstrations! Eliminate corruption and establish a new state! A new state! Down with dictatorship and the military regime! Down with the regime! Down with dictatorship! If you wipe on toothpaste your eyes will hurt less. - Joo-hee? - Tae-soo? Put on toothpaste. It's been a long time. It has. Have you heard from Joon-ha? Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha come back alive! Joon-ah! You have to come back alive! Joon-ha! Joon-ha answer me! Joon-ha! Joon-ha... come back alive! Joon-ha come back alive! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joo-hee! - Joon-ha! - Joo-hee! - Joo-hee! - Joon-ha! Tae-soo! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! Joon-ha! You have to come back alive! Joon-ha! Joon-ha come back alive! You have to come back alive! Got it? Medic! Medic! Hold on! Hold on! Breathe! Breathe! Stop it! He's dead! Retreat! Get moving, you bastard! Joon-ha, you bastard! Where are you going? Come back! Corporal OH! You haven't changed at all. Just like in the past you're still pretty I've aged a lot. - You had it hard, huh? - Not really. How's Tae-soo doing? I guess he's doing alright. Why didn't you get married? Well, I did. I heard. I had so much to tell you. But now that we've met I can't remember. It's a piano doll. We have one at my home, too. When I look at it it reminds me of you playing the piano. It looks so much like you back then. Doesn't it? We were so innocent back then. But the past has gone now. I think our feelings took the best of us. We cried and laughed at the smallest things. How do I look right now? You look healthy. But I'd like to see you look happier. I'm crying right now Can't you see my tears? Why did you hide that you couldn't see? It's late. Sorry, I have an appointment I have to go. I'm sorry. It was almost perfect I could've succeeded I even came here last night to practice. You almost fooled me. You did a good job I nearly believed you. Also... I risked my life to return this necklace to you. Please don't. This necklace is yours. Afterwards, mom and dad got married And I was born three years later. Then a few years later... Mrs. Sung Joo-hee? Joon-ha's last wish was for you to spread his dust in this river. Actually. Joon-ha got married right after you did. Poor guy had a son, too. And Joon-ha wanted you to have this. Mommy, it's a rainbow. I still remember clearly the rainbow I saw that day. Until I finished telling this story. Open your hands.
