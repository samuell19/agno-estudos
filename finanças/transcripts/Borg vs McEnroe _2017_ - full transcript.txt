Subtitles by explosiveskull [crowd cheering] [chair umpire] Quiet, please. Quiet, please. [TV announcer] There it is, the cathedral of tennis, Centre Court, Wimbledon. And the two top players in the world, Björn Borg and John McEnroe, are about to come out. [British commentator] It's the perfect rivalry. The baseline player and the net rusher. [man] Ice Borg versus SuperBrat. [TV announcer] Björn Borg, four championships in a row, aiming for a fifth. [TV announcer] Björn Borg has broken McEnroe! McEnroe again says no! It's dead even! [crowd cheering] [crowd chanting] Borg! Borg! Borg! Borg! Borg! Borg! Borg! Borg! - Borg! Borg! - [chair umpire] Quiet, please. Final set, Borg serving. [speaking Swedish] [man speaking Swedish, laughing] [man] [speaks Swedish] - [men chattering] - Good luck at Wimbledon. - Thank you. - Björn. - Make sure you bring home the trophy now, huh? - Do my best. [speaking French] [speaking French] Yeah, sure. Here you go. [French] - You selling these? - Björn! Björn! [screaming] Björn! Björn! Björn! [car horn honking] [girls shrieking] [speaking French] Uh, sorry. Don't... Don't speak French. [stammers] Un café s'il vous plaît? - Un café? - Café. [machine humming] [French] Merci. Do you speak English? - Little. - A little. Uh... Uh, can I come in with the money later? 'Cause I left my wallet in the car. No, no, no, no, no. - No? - No. Okay? It's, uh... It's everything. - Thank you. I am Amidou. - Thank you. Uh, my name is, uh, Rune. - [chuckles] Rune? - Rune. Rune. It's, uh... - Rune. [laughs] - Swedish. Rune. [laughing] What you do? Uh, I-I wo... Uh... I work as a... an, uh, electrician. Yes. [chuckles] Merci. You like electric? Yes, it's... Yeah, it's, uh... It's a very good job. It's a normal job. [speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] - [speakers: hard rock] - [linesman] Out. - Fuck! - How? That is a break point. Get down and look at it! - [crowd booing] - Shut the fuck up! [chattering] ...and you don't think that my dad's gonna... - That's on you, my man. That's not on me. - [crowd booing] I don't give a shit about crap like you. [jeering] - This is out, this is in! - Fuck! - Fuck you! - I have to ask that you resume playing, Mr. McEnroe. Fuck! There's not been any mistakes officiating the lines today at all? - Answer the question. - [chair umpire] Time! The question, jerk-off! Answer the question! - [audience laughing] - [hard rock continues] - Stopping? I'm stopping play? - The man The New York Times described as being the worst representative of American values since Al Capone. - [audience laughs] - Ladies and gentlemen, John McEnroe. [applause, cheering] [man] ♪ Freedom ♪ ♪ Driving in the fast lane ♪ So, John, uh, you upset anybody out in the wings yet? - No, not that I know of. Not yet. - [audience laughs] You know, I like you, John. You're great. - And, um, in three days... - Three days. - you're going to London to play Wimbledon. - Yep. [audience] Yeah! Yeah! And everyone's talking about Björn Borg's chance to win his fifth straight title and make tennis history. Now, apparently, the only thing standing between Borg and that record is you. - Mm-hmm. - [cheering, applause] Well, here's what, uh, they're saying over in London, - where you're hardly making any friends. - [audience booing] John, I gotta ask you. What is it that you've done to the Brits? Yeah, I don't know. It's just such a different place, you know? It's a different culture and they have warm beer and it's just a different thing. Have you got a plan to get them to stop booing? I plan to go in there and play my game, and if I beat Borg in the finals, it's very hard to boo me if I'm number one. - So... - [cheering, applause] [clamoring] - Can you make a charge, stop McEnroe? - They say McEnroe... [reporters all speaking at once] [girl] I love you, Björn! - [speaking Swedish] - Björn, I love you! [reporter] How do you feel about John McEnroe? Well, here's what the press here is saying. [audience laughing] I can be anybody's nightmare though, you know. But I guess I wouldn't be exaggerating if I were to say that you and Borg are as different as two people could possibly be. You keep going back to Borg. Is he backstage? Is he gonna jump out of a cake? [laughter, applause] Feel like we keep talking about him. You know, I'm here. I'm working interviews. Here we are. It's just that Borg is often described as being pure perfection and, uh, zero emotion. Do you think he ever loses it? I don't know. [speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] You're gonna spend the whole fucking interview talking about Borg? You said we were gonna talk about the future of tennis. Now you're gonna bullshit me? That's so fucked up. Every fucking time, man. Fuck this stupid shit! - They promised, Dad. This is pointless, man. - You did fine. - You did fine. That's everything. - Every fucking time! [British commentator] Two days to go, Arthur, and everybody's talking about Björn Borg, the Swede who, at only 24, could make history by winning his fifth Wimbledon. Can McEnroe pull Borg from his throne, Arthur? [Ashe] Borg will be playing under a tremendous amount of pressure. Everyone expects him to win. McEnroe, on the other hand, he is the perfect underdog. [man] You've played them both. Who's the toughest opponent? [Ashe] McEnroe is the bigger talent, but playing Borg is like being hit by a sledgehammer. But if Borg is a sledgehammer, I'd say that McEnroe is a stiletto. A slash here, a slice there, and suddenly you're covered in blood even though none of the wounds are particularly deep, and then... then you bleed to death. 6,000. 6,000! [girl] Björn! We love you! [fans shouting] [speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] [reporter] So I hadn't seen you since the opening. [chattering] Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Borg will be here in a moment. Any questions for the other players? - Did he win already? - [reporters laughing] [reporter] Mr. Borg, the Daily Mail. [reporters clamoring] [speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] Mr. Borg, how does it feel knowing you'll make history if you win your fifth Wimbledon? No special feelings. - Björn! Björn! - Mr. Borg! [reporters clamoring] [shutters clicking] [girls screaming] [girls] Björn! Björn! [man] This is for the fall of '82. It's two years away, so you don't need to think about it now, but just so you know, we're aiming mostly for Asia. Exhibition tournaments in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, maybe China, and then South Africa. But I think we said no to South Africa. It's a million dollars. For one match. Yes, but it's also supporting apartheid. [speaking Swedish] [Swedish] [knocking] [speaking English] Put here. Thank you. Soon you're gonna need another room for all those wedding gifts. We've had an offer from the Daily Mail for the photo rights for your wedding. - What was the other offer, Andy? - Uh, the Post. [Andy] 200. Oh, no, we decided on a private wedding. [man] Well, that's exactly why you should sell the rights. Otherwise you're gonna have 50 paparazzi hiding in the bushes. [speaking Swedish] We've got some, uh... [speaking Swedish] [man] ♪ I hear the big beat ♪ ♪ All through the town ♪ ♪ I want the big beat ♪ ♪ I get around ♪ ♪ There's no time For hesitation ♪ [music stops] Calder. Hey, can I make a request? Do you have any black felt-tip markers? Like a Sharpie and a big 80-by-80 piece of paper? Like a board? Like a poster? Can you send up the markers then? Okay, thank you. [line ringing] - [woman on phone] McEnroe residence. - Hey. Hi, Mom. Is Dad there? No, he's at proceedings with a client. - Do you know when he's gonna be back? - After lunch. - Whenever that is. - [Mom scoffs] Well, then can he call me after the client thing? - Why do you need to talk to him? - Because it's important. - Okay. - Why else... [Mom groans] Now don't-don't be angry. I'm not. - You are sounding... - No, I just don't want to... I don't want to have this with you, you know? There's a lot going on. There's a lot going on here too.

[woman speaks Swedish] [people chattering, laughing] Mmm... Ja. Hmm. Hmm. Björn? Nej. Nej. [chuckles] [Bergelin speaking Swedish] [birds chirping] [speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] - [chair umpire] Love-15. - [applause] [applause] [chair umpire on TV] 40-love. [TV announcer] Björn Borg, world number one, is having an unexpectedly hard time against the unseeded Egyptian El Shafei. [knocking] No, thank you. [knocking] I said no, thank you. I said it twi... Oh, Pete. - Oh, my God. - [laughing] [McEnroe laughing] You motherfucker. - You good? - Yeah. Look. There it is. [Pete laughs] Basically, you win all your matches, we see each other in the quarters, and I got Connors in the semi, Borg in the final. - [Pete] How long this take you? - About an hour or so. - You got your wallet? - Yep. I gotta get out of here, man. - How's your foot? - It's better. - Yeah? - Yeah, I got this ankle support. - It's, uh... It's working. - Good. See how it goes? Cut here. Yeah. Okay. - Then we meet here. - Yeah. You're gonna go this way. - Okay. - And that's us here. You stop there. [laughing] And the rest of this shit goes. You're that sure you're gonna beat me? - Oh, fuck yeah. - Yeah? [laughing] [TV reporter] Any comments on your performance today, Mr. Borg? Well, he played very, very good, and, uh, I beat him in the end, but, uh, it's, uh... it was not easy. But I'm looking forward to the next game. [TV reporter] So, tougher than you thought out there. It took time to feel the surface, but then after a while, I played my tennis. You know how many times I've tried to do this, go into a match and just been, like, no emotion, all order, just be Borg. This is impossible. This is not... - This isn't human. He's like... - [Gerulaitis] Yo! - Hey. - Where you guys been? I been looking for you. - Just here. Yeah. - How ya doin'? How ya doin'? Cool. Want a drink? - Peter. - Good to see you. I got a car waiting for us. Let's go. - No, I gotta see Jennie. - Peter. - [Pete] Sorry. - All right. Here we go. - Come on. - Send my love to Jennie. Come on, ladies. - Let's go. Let's go. - Yeah. Come on. Keep up. Come on. It's like my second home. I love this place. Honestly. Everybody's so good here. - Good people here. Hey. - Hey, Vitas. - How you doing? How you doing, man? - Good to see you. Hey, hey! [woman] Hey! Whoo! Oh! [shouting] Hit me in the fucking head! - [McEnroe] Hey, are you watching the matches? - Ahhh! - You watch the Borg match? Did you see what I'm seeing? - Yeah. You see him get slower? Like much, much slower? - [scoffs] - Because he's out of shape? You'll understand someday, all right? Explain it. Look. You got four Wimbledon titles. All right? It's a lot of pressure. Everybody wants to beat Björn. Everybody wants something from Björn. It makes you the loneliest fucking guy on the planet, you know? Mmm. That's good shit. Um, look. This is... This is Eve, and this is Eve, and they're Brits. They're beautiful fucking ladies. They want to meet you, they want to party with you. They fucking love you, and I just... I can't talk about tennis here. Look at these titties, right? What the fuck? What more do you want, John? [laughing] - But look. You wanna know what Björn's doing right now? - Yes. He's in bed. His room is cold as fuck because he wants his pulse below 50 beats a minute. - [McEnroe] That's a rumor. - It's not. He's got all these superstitions. - Rituals. - Cut the shit and say the stuff I want to fucking hear. This year, his parents aren't allowed to come. All right? He only lets them come every second year, and when they do, they gotta wear the same clothes throughout the tournament. - Get the fuck outta here. - Yeah, right? Every year he trains on the same court, he rents the same hotel, he rents the same car, he sleeps in the same room. His coach always brings 50 rackets strung tight as fuck, and every night before the match, they meet in Lennart's room, going over all the rackets, organizing everything according to tension and key. It's like a fucking religion. Mariana, his girlfriend, she takes care of his bag. Same meticulous order. Everything exact. What is that? When he gets to the arena, takes the same chair and two towels. Not one. Not three. Two. And he never treads on the baseline. - [McEnroe] Why? - 'Cause that means bad luck. They say he's an iceberg. Really he's a volcano keeping it all in until boom. [grunts] [grunting] [grunts] A bit shorter, huh? That geography test. What happened there? I got a 96 out of a hundred. What about the other four? I got the top of my class. How many kids in your class, John? Thirty. The real world outside of school is a lot bigger than 30 people. Right? [sighs] Tennis making you lose focus? [pigeons cooing] [wings flapping] Oh, come on. Is somebody gonna do something about the pigeons? I mean... - [crowd jeering] - You don't hear that? - [booing] - On the roof. You don't hear that? On the roof. - Nothing will be done about any pigeons... - Of course not. - during this match, Mr. McEnroe. - Fuck it. - [man] Go, Mac! - [crowd jeering] - Pigeons are ruining my focus! Don't you get it? - [woman shouts] - I have to ask you to continue playing, Mr. McEnroe. - Shut up. Shut up. - [man] Come on, Big Mac! - [booing continues] - Shh! - [booing subsides] - [McEnroe grunts] - [chair umpire] 15-love. [applause] - [crowd whistling] - Why don't you light off fireworks while I'm doing this? Light off fireworks while I'm serving, okay? Whistle a fucking song or something. Boo! - [booing] - [chair umpire] Quiet, please. Thank-Thank you. Thank you. - [spectator whistles] - Come on. Shut the fuck up! New ball. Give me another ball. [Mariana speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] [chair umpire] 30-love. [Bergelin speaking Swedish] [grunts] [speaking Swedish] [McEnroe jabbering] My father's gonna appeal it anyway. But congrats on staying awake for the whole match today, boss. Lighten up, junior. You won. Come on. Give us a smile. - Shut the fuck up. - Fuck you. [applauding] [chair umpire] Love-40. [thunder rumbling] [door closes] [speaking Swedish] [door opens] [door closes] [Bergelin speaking Swedish] [grunts] [grunts] [speaking Swedish] [Mariana speaking Swedish] [Mariana] [Mariana speaking Swedish] [racket striking ball] [applause, cheering] [British commentator] So, Arthur, what must Björn Borg be thinking after this sensational demonstration? [Ashe] Well, if McEnroe can maintain this form, - we may very well have a new champion. - [TV off] [Swedish] [speaking Swedish] [knocking] [door opens] [Bergelin sighs] [speaking Swedish] [door closes] [Swedish] [retches, coughs, spits] [water splashes] [Bergelin speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] - [screaming] - [man] The world of tennis has never before seen anything quite like this.

Where's my ankle support? The fuck? Come on, John. John, give me the ankle support. - John. - [knocking] [man] If you gentlemen would like to come this way? - [spectators applauding] - [chair umpire] 40-15. [announcer] John McEnroe is slaughtering fellow countryman Peter Fleming. [spectators cheering] I didn't take your ankle thing, you know? I really didn't, Pete. That's not something I would do. Why... - Fuck you, John. - Fuck me, fuck me. Fine. Fuck me. Who cares? Fuck me. Fine. Look, I fucking told you, man. I fucking told you. Didn't I? - Fuck the ankle support, okay? - Are you done? Sit down. Hey. Are we good? I'm gonna say this once. You're going to win Wimbledon. If not this year, then it's only a matter of time. You're going to be number one. - [scoffs] - I know it. Okay. But you will never be remembered as one of the greats. You know why? John, look at me. 'Cause nobody likes you. Not one kid out there wants to be like Johnny Mac when he grows up. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. You know, in 20 years, the only thing people are gonna say is, "Hey, what was the name of that crazy guy that always yelled at the umpire?" You fucked up my game. I'm your friend. [door slams] [whispering] Say sorry. Fuck him. [woman] John McEnroe? Hi, John. How are you? You think maybe we could ask the receptionist not to yell out my name like that every time I come in here? - Weren't you the only one out there? - I'm the only one out there. It makes me feel uncomfortable, she yells my name out like that. - I walk in here edgy. - Okay. - Well, we don't want you edgy. - Okay. - We want you to feel comfortable. - Thank you. No problem. John, you mentioned defensive. It's your move, Dad. How's the back? It's the same. He's already seen a lefty before he got here. I mean, it's... it's not even a surprise, you know? But he hasn't seen you. We win. - [bell dings] - This way, please. [chattering] - Can we touch it? - Yeah. We push a button now, we can get billboards out before the final. Isn't this a bit simplistic? Shouldn't we see another side of John? What we are seeing right now is unique. Tennis players are like rock stars. The tabloids are having a field day with him, but this rivalry between Borg and John is forcing people to ask themselves, "Who am I? The gentleman or the rebel?" [announcer] It's a beautiful morning here at Wimbledon for the men's semifinals. [cheering] Björn Borg is up against the American, Brian Gottfried. And in a second semifinal, a clash between two of the most controversial figures of tennis today, John McEnroe and fellow countryman Jimmy Connors. First serve, Wimbledon semifinal. [chair umpire] Love-15. [spectators groan] 15-40. Game and second set to Gottfried. One set all. [announcer] Björn Borg is having a tough time against Gottfried. Unexpectedly tough. [spectators booing] [announcer] Listen to those jeers. I can't remember a single Wimbledon match where the crowd has made this much noise. Out. - Out. - Wha... Excuse me? [chair umpire] It wasn't on this side of the line, Mr. McEnroe. - The chalk flew up. - The ball has been ruled out. - Excuse me? - It was a good call. It was a bit of a scramble. You can't be serious. You cannot be serious! The ball was on the line! Chalk flew up all over, man! - [spectators booing] - Chalk flew up! He saw it. That's why he's walking all over it. Everyone saw it was in. You cannot possibly call that out. I'm going to issue you a warning for unsportsmanlike behavior, Mr. McEnroe. - [cheering] - Borg isn't playing any great tennis, but it's enough to beat the unseeded American Gottfried. Congratulations on reaching the finals. So it's either Jimmy Connors or John McEnroe that awaits you now. How do you respond to McEnroe's comment from before the tournament that Borg, the machine, will soon break down? I... I'm just like, uh, anybody else. I'm not a machine. [reporter] Just one more word! You guys are the pits of the world. You keep your mouth shut. Keep your mouth shut. Why don't you stay on your side? No one's talking to you. - I'm talking to you. - Shut the fuck up. No one's talking to you. [booing] Fuckin' asshole. Yeah, I'm so fucking disgusting. Go home then! - [woman] Play some tennis! - Shut the fuck up! Go play tennis by yourself. John, congratulations on your victory today. - What do you have to say about your behavior? - Can we talk about my tennis? Are you worried about the reputation you've gained over here? People are talking more about your behavior than your tennis. You're certainly talking more about my behavior than my tennis. - Do you think it's valid? - No. [man] But do you have any regrets about your behavior? I mean, I regret I gotta sit here and talk to you. That's all I regret. Do you expect anyone to root for you in the final against Borg? Look, I get that, uh, you got your hero. Your gentleman, Borg, and you need a villain. - Do you think you'll be able to keep your temper? - Let's talk about tennis. Does anybody have tennis questions? Do you enjoy being a villain? Do you feel it helps you? - You think you'll keep your temper? - Shut the fuck up, man. - Are you watching the matches? - Yes, I'm watching the matches. You don't understand what the fuck it takes to play tennis. Do you know I go up there, I give everything for this game? Everything. Everything in me gets left out on that fucking court. And none of you understand because none of you do it. [woman speaks Swedish] How was the flight? You look great. - This is the crew from Argentina. - [speaking Spanish] - Björn. - [Spanish continues] [man speaking Swedish] [speaking Swedish] I can't remember which door. Well, can't you just pick one? They all look alike. No, it has to be the right one. [camera shutter clicks] Wait. Wait, please. Wait with the camera. - Björn, I don't really think it's all that important. - It's very important. - [woman speaks Spanish] - [speaks Swedish] [Rune speaking Swedish] [door opens] [inhales] [exhales] [sniffles] [chattering] Five minutes, gentlemen. [man speaking Swedish] - Turn down the volume on McEnroe, Mike. - What? - But they switch sides all the time. - That's an order from the top. [speaking various languages] It's the perfect rivalry... the baseline player and the net rusher. [speaking German] [speaking Swedish] Ice Borg versus SuperBrat. 15,000 spectators. Hundreds of millions at home by their TV's. [speaking French] [man] Gentlemen. - [British announcer] First out is McEnroe. - [whistling, booing] The crowd is booing him. That's a first in a Wimbledon final. [announcer speaking Swedish] [American announcer] There he is... Björn Borg, the emperor. This court belongs to him. The final we've all been waiting for. Borg, a legend in his own lifetime. Tremendous pressure on him today. He's won it four times, but the fifth time, I'm sure, will be even harder. [chair umpire] Quiet, please. Quiet, please. McEnroe to serve. Ready? Play. 15-love. [American announcer] There's the talent in McEnroe in the opening point. [announcer speaking Swedish] - [spectators applauding] - 40-love. - [spectators cheering] - And there's Borg's blistering return of serve. 40-15. - Game to McEnroe. - First game of the match goes to McEnroe. McEnroe's serve and volley decides the first game. [linesman] Out. [American announcer] McEnroe takes the game! What a fantastic start for McEnroe. [chair umpire] McEnroe to serve. - [spectators groan] - Game, McEnroe. [British announcer] Borg really having difficulty with McEnroe's left-handed serve. [American announcer] Like trying to catch hummingbirds. Borg looks shell-shocked. [British announcer] McEnroe is humiliating Borg, and he's making him look slow. [speaking German] [speaking Swedish] [chair umpire] Game and first set to McEnroe, six games to one. [American announcer] Björn Borg is in trouble. Trouble in Sweden. [chair umpire] New balls, please. - Time. - [spectators applauding] Second set, Borg to serve. - [man] Come on, Björn! - [chair umpire] Quiet, please. - [announcer] Point Borg! An unbelievable serve. - [spectators cheering] [British announcer] That's the Borg we know. - [linesman] Out. - [chair umpire] Game to Borg. We're seeing a completely different Borg in the second set. [American announcer] There it is! Björn Borg takes himself to set point. [spectators cheering] [cheering] [chair umpire] Game and second set to Borg, seven games to five. [American announcer] This is exactly what Björn Borg wants. And McEnroe seems out of touch. [British announcer] It's a big momentum raiser when you come from behind like Borg has done, and it tends to undermine your opponent's confidence. [spectators cheering] 40-15. [British announcer] So that's Borg, two set points. - Out! - Game and third set to Borg. [American announcer] And there it is... Björn Borg wins the third set, and he leads two sets to one. [British announcer] So, there's going to be a fourth set now. If Borg wins it, he can call himself five-time Wimbledon champion. [spectators cheering] - Fault! - [American announcer] Fault called. I thought it was good. McEnroe thought it was good. 30-40. - Fuck. - Second double fault. [speaking German] [linesman] Out. Out. [British announcer] I believe the umpire's wrong about that call. How will McEnroe react to this? 30-15. [woman] Let's go, John! [chair umpire] Time. It's all right. It's a great match. Just play your tennis. [American announcer] Ace, McEnroe! [British announcer] McEnroe's getting stronger as the set goes on. [American announcer] McEnroe has the game. A 3-2 lead in the fourth set. - Just out. - Come on, John. [American announcer] The pressure is now all on the Swede. - [spectators cheering] - Game to Borg. [American announcer] He has the game. Five-all. It's out. Björn Borg is in the lead. And ace for Borg. He can almost taste the championship now. [American announcer] So here it is, championship point. Quiet, please. [cheering] Oh, no, fault called. Quiet, please. Second serve. [American announcer] He saves the first match point. Second championship point for Borg. [grunts] Borg's got to try not to think about those lost match points now. [American announcer] McEnroe! Break point for John McEnroe. [chair umpire] Quiet, please. - Quiet, please. - [British announcer] What a moment this is for Borg. He stands to serve, having lost two match points. McEnroe is back in the match, now with a chance to make it even. [spectators cheering] [American announcer] John McEnroe has snatched it away from Borg just like that! [chair umpire] Six games all. Tiebreak now comes into operation. No men's final has ever ended in a tiebreaker. [American announcer] Björn Borg has taken himself to another championship point. [American announcer] McEnroe says no once again. What determination! [British announcer] There's the greatness of Borg. Just one fleeting opportunity, and it's through like a rapier. Championship point number four. [American announcer] Oh, John McEnroe! He has ripped four match points from Björn Borg! [American announcer] He has set point. Now McEnroe has the chance to turn this whole thing upside down. Ball. [British announcer] If either man took any more punishment, if this were a heavyweight boxing match, they'd stop the fight. If Borg wins this point, the roof will blow off the Centre Court. [man] Come on, Björn! Quiet, please. [American announcer] Borg got so close, but McEnroe just won't give in. Both men have looked down the barrel of the gun and they're both still alive. [British announcer] I don't think I've ever seen a tiebreak like this. [American announcer] McEnroe again says no! [various announcers overlapping] [British announcer] Set point for McEnroe. [spectators groan] [American announcer] The linesman calls it out! [chair umpire] 15-all. [British announcer] I can't believe it. The score is 15-all. Yes! - [cheering] - Yes! [American announcer] It's dead even! - Come on! - [American announcer] Incredible! McEnroe wins the tiebreak, 18-16. Björn Borg has lost seven match points. [British announcer] And what must Borg be thinking? That elusive fifth championship almost within his reach, but stolen away from him seven times. [speaking Swedish] [cheering] [British announcer] This is nothing short of unbelievable. No one can recover after losing seven match points in a Wimbledon final. But Borg is playing like nothing happened. [American announcer] And now it's all about heart. Hearts beating on either side of the net. They can hit the ball. It's up to the hearts. [spectators cheering] So once again, match point, Borg. [cheering] [American announcer] Five times in a row! Game, set, and championship to Borg. [no audible dialogue] [cheering] [cheering louder] And now, ladies and gentlemen, the runner-up of Wimbledon 1980, John Patrick McEnroe. [cheering] [British announcer] Here he comes. Standing ovation for McEnroe, whose behavior today was beyond reproach. [American announcer] John Patrick McEnroe is not a champion today, but he has finally won the hearts of Great Britain. [British announcer] And Borg, king of the tennis world, without a doubt. - [woman] Well played. - Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.
