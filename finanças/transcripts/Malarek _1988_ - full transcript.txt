At Christmas, they used to send the loony kids to Detention Centre because, uh, their staff was on holidays. We used to call them Christmas fruit cakes. You mean, they send loonies to prison for the holidays, man? Let's go for some burgers, man. Mr. Banks! Mr. Banks. Get out of here. Sir. Marie Archambault died here. Can I ask you just one question? No. Now, what the hell was she doing here? She was never even arrested. No comment. Does the term "Christmas fruit cake" mean anything to you, then? No. It doesn't? All right then, man. You get a messed-up little girl and she kills herself. We're gonna fry your ass on the front page. You know what? You are dead, Malrich. You are dead. Mal-a-rek... Mr. Banks. Now you get it right. And you sing it on the way home, you understand? Good morning, "Montreal Tribune." [Claire] Victor? Victor? Okay, I want to think about this. What's wrong? The writing's rough. Well, we'll smooth it out. I told you I wanted it all on the record, not just sources. This stuff is a lawyer's wet dream. Come on, Claire. I want Moorcraft to take a look at this. Hello, Victor. I don't think you've ever been properly introduced. This is Mr. Moorcraft. Victor Malarek, sir. Hi, Victor. Please, sit down. Victor, we've been discussing your copy. The accusations are extremely serious. And we don't think you have it. We can't run this until you have more on the record and more facts. What? We've put Bill on to double-check. I'm sorry, Victor. I didn't come up with anything to confirm your story. Every source I have-- the courts, the police, social affairs, all denials. And that social worker, Harold Stern? Denies saying that suicides were covered up to protect Catholic families. You're the one who gave me Marie Archambault's name. Yeah, but I found out she died on a weekend pass from the Children's Psychiatric Institute. Then how come Gray saw her dead at the Detention Centre? Boys and girls are kept in separate buildings. How could he see her? In the infirmary. What about a coroner's report? It was missing. I looked for it a whole day. It says she was found in the street. An accidental death. I also have a psychiatric file. It says she was on a weekend pass, not transferred to juvenile detention, which jives with the coroner's report. She wasn't. Let me see this file. Well, I don't believe he has it. It'll reveal my source. Victor, I'm on your side. Now, at one point, you said you had an adult source inside juvenile detention. Who is it? It'll reveal my source. You're new, Victor. We don't know about you. We know you're ambitious. Sometimes ambitious people take shortcuts. You think I made it up? Look-- listen, you've got some good stuff here. I'm not denying that. I just propose sitting on it for a while. Then how many more kids do you think will be dead by then, Mr. Moorcraft? One, three, 10? My job's this paper, okay? We print fact, not fiction. Okay, my job is to report. And this is fact, so print it. All I'm saying is... Well, what you've given us reads like tea leaves. Now I'm going to put Bill and Claire on it. They've got more experience than you. Bill and Claire? They have-- Sir, everything here, everything here, I saw. Come on, Victor. How do you know? What do you want? What do you want, Claire? Corpses or what? Easy, cream and sugar. Shut up, asshole. You think like a cop, you smell like a cop. The only different between you and a cop is you don't have a stinking badge on your tit. You calm down, young man. What are you saying? You're on my side? Just calm down.Yeah. You have the half the town denying they said what you said they said. You attacked a prison director, you broke into a psychiatric institute. All right. Okay. Sir, are you going to let me keep on this story or what? No. You know, Mr. Moorcraft, you have no idea what goes on, really, in this city. You know, these kids, their families break up and they're shoved into some boys' home with a bunch of other kids who are treated like animals and they become bums. And then they make one little mistake and then the whole goddamn-- Are you listening? The whole system wants to teach them a lesson of their young lives and everybody else wonders around here why every little step they took was a, was a backward one. You know, Mr. Moorcraft, you know, you're sitting pretty on your little mansion up there by the river with your handed-down paper. Claire over here can't decide whether to smoke or sit down and this guy can't stop drinking and you're telling me about what's going on out there? Fuck you, man. Fuck your paper. Fuck everything.
