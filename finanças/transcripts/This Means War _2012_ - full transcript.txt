Always for one. LAUREN: Ugh! It was the most humiliating moment ever. Well, because you have to come up with, like, better excuses. You should've been, "l have a fiancé too. But he's getting a penile reduction... ...because his penis is so big every time it lands like a poltergeist." Can't think of anything when l see him. l just can't believe l gave up everything for him. lt's just, l felt so stupid. l left my friends, my family-- Don't say that, l'm happy you moved here. We have a happy life together. He was my person. He was your person. You know what kind of person he ended up? The person that ends up with a girl that makes out after she eats yellowtail. l like sushi. She seemed really nice. She was really pretty. Well, l don't give a shit about her. l give a shit about you and your love life. l'm going out, dating, meeting guys. Oh, please, you're not-- You date, but you're not taking it seriously. Don't use that brand, it leaves a film. That one's much more effective. l wish you would act like that with men. You can choose a laundry detergent, but you can't choose a guy you want-- That's my job. lt's easier. There's charts, there's numbers. That's why you start online dating. They have lots of charts. Not that again. What is your problem with online? What's my problem? Do you watch Dateline? How many creeps are out there? l could end up a skin suit or in somebody's trunk. Uh, that's a little dramatic, okay? That happens to, like, one in 20 girls. You're not gonna end up in a trunk. lf you're lucky... ...somebody will end up in your trunk. That's your trunk. Ha, ha. Stop. You need to get back out there, okay? Yeah, sure, you might make a mistake and end up with the wrong guy... ...but you might end up meeting the right guy. So isn't that worth it? What is the worst thing that could happen? Skin suit. Skin suit's pretty bad. TUCK: Thank you for having me to your nana's. FDR: Are you kidding me? You're my best friend. We're family. Oh, my God.

And l'm gonna bring the binoculars, the hand cream... ...keep a hundred-yard radius. lt'll be sweet stuff. No, you can't bring the binoculars. You're not watching my date. l need a little privacy. l'll be around the corner on ringtone. l'll be at the video store. One ring means you need an extraction, two, a cleaner, three, l can get home. Two hundred yards. Sold. [LAUGHS] Tuck? Are you Tuck? Hi. l'm Lauren. Oh, my gosh. Hello. How are you? Very nice to meet you. You too. Um.... Please, sit. Please, sorry. Yeah. Wow, it's like-- You are really, really beautiful. Could you say that a few more times, because your voice is amazing. Ha, ha. l feel like l need to apologize again for that bizarre profile. No, no, no. My friend, Trish, is.... Oh, no. Everybody should have a friend who's a spaz. l think l'm going to have to kill her. Well, actually... ...l might be able to help you. l'm kidding.

[CELL PHONE RlNGlNG] FRANKENSTElN: ...do not open this door or you will undo everything l've worked for. Good for you, pal. So tell me one thing that's not on your profile. Um.... l have a son. Oh, you do? Yeah. He's called Joe. He's 7 and he's really lovely. Really lovely. And his mom? Couldn't work. How about you? No kids that l know of. Okay. And no ex-wives. l have a very important question to ask. Good. Go on. Have you ever been or do you ever plan on being a serial killer? Well, l mean, it's-- You gotta keep your options open. But, no. Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha. [BOTH LAUGHlNG] So you've never killed anybody with your bare hands. Not this week. Great. Lauren, you're incredible. You're not so bad yourself. All right, l'm gonna go and rent a movie and take a cold shower. l will too. Okay. And wait for your call for the next-- Five minutes? [LAUGHS] HENRY [ON TV]: This is where it all started. Yes, I was standing over there by that desk. MARTHA: No, you were sitting in the chair. And suddenly, you started walking toward me. Very slowly. Very slowly. I could count every step. And when you're walking towards me very slowly... ...l thought, "What's the matter with him? Can't he walk faster?" Oh, l'm so sorry. Oh, l'm sorry. You take it. No, no, no, that's okay. You take it. Sure? You're not gonna like it. Twist ending. You'll see it coming a mile away. And how would you know what l like? l know movies. And women. Really? Mm-hm. Okay. Well, then, why don't you tell me what l want? The Lady Vanishes? Why is that? Mm-hm. Well, firstly, you can never go wrong with Hitchcock. Ever. lt's got comedy, drama, romance, it's a thriller. lt's classy, but not stuffy. A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it, you'll thank me for introducing you to it. lf you have, you'll know what a good choice it was. Well, l have seen it. Mm-hm. And it is a really good choice. Mm. However, not as good as Rebecca, Notorious, Vertigo... ...or pretty much any of his films from 1 960 to 1 972. ln fact, it's sort of a second-tier title. A second. You know what? Scratch-- Look, l see you surveying the prospects. That one over there in Foreign? Too much angst. This one in the sweater set, picking out animated movies? That girl will have your children named before breakfast. The problem is, no one looks like a clean getaway. l get it. You come in here looking for a girl renting a movie. Clearly, she doesn't have a date for the night. We're easy targets. You look like the guy interested in a one-day rental... ...if you know what l mean. lf you knew anything about women... ...or anything about me, l'm perfectly capable of choosing my own movies. But thanks. Happy hunting. Hm. MAN: So, sir, you want me to hack into a video store database? FDR: lt's for the Heinrich case. COMPUTER VOlCE: Searching database. FDR: All right, keep on scrolling. Wait. Stop. Scroll back. That's her. Sir, how is this girl connected to Heinrich? That's G-4 classified. Hello, everybody, l'm Lauren Scott. Thank you so much for being here today. ALL: Good morning, Lauren. We're here today to talk about grills. Does anybody have any first impressions? l like the rotisserie feature. Perfect. That's very helpful. FDR: l don't think it heated up fast enough. Like something was wrong with the motor, maybe the spark was dead. Actually, sir, there's nothing wrong with the spark. Some people think grills just burst into flames at the slightest touch. lt doesn't work like that. Does anybody have any useful opinions? l thought the lid was hard to handle. Mm-hm. Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right? l just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff, uptight, not really user-friendly. l think it depends on the user. Mm. lt so happens l have a lot of experience with grills. l'm something of a grill master. Uh, this is a sophisticated grill. Not sure you've dealt with one of those before. Or maybe a grill like this is just so scared of being burned... ...it stays on simmer and never really heats up all the way. Don't touch my grill. l don't think this can handle a guy like me. l think it could. Really? Easily. Prove it. 8 p.m. Barcelona. Tomorrow. l don't think so. l guess l could stick around a little longer, talk about grills. Charcoal or gas, number 1 9, what do you think? lf l say yes, will you leave? This is my job. Eight p.m. tomorrow. Fine. Fine. Fine. [SNlFFS] You smell nice. Bye. What were you doing on the computer? Porn? l have a photograph of my girl. l was doing the same thing. A background check. l don't know if that's creepy or romantic. "Cromantic." l do it all the time. Wanna see? Yeah, sure. Wanna see her? Yeah. l bet yours has got antlers and howls. She does, but she's incredibly attractive with them. She's a 1 0. Go on three. One, two, three and go? All right. Okay. l'll sound off. Okay. One... One. ...two, three. That's, uh, Lauren S-- Lauren? Lauren Scott? Scott. That's the girl from the video store? Right around the corner from the bar. Oh, wow. Um.... l had no idea. Of course. How could you know that? Did she, ahem, actually say she wanted to go out on a date with you, though? You know what? l'm gonna make this really easy. l'm gonna bow out. You date her. Hang on. Did she say she wanted to go out with you? lt doesn't matter. l love you. You're my best friend. Yeah. You go date her. Yeah, if l got in the picture, it wouldn't be fair. Well, l'm sorry. What does that mean? [SlGHS] What does that mean? l mean, come on, man... ...you're not out there as much as l am. And like anything... ...practice makes, uh.... Perfect? No, no, no. You're perfect? Maybe not perfect, but damn near close... Wow. ...to perfect. You believe that as well? You don't have to bow out because of me. l don't? l'm not concerned that she's gonna fall in love with you, pal. How very nice of you. Thank you. You are welcome. So do your thing. Whatever that is. And, um... ...just let her decide. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. While we're at it, why don't we put ground rules in? We should. One, l don't think... ...we should tell we know each other. Two, stay out of each other's way. Three. Yeah. No hanky-panky, no hanky-panky. God, you have not dated in a long time, have you? And if this ever starts to affect our friendship... Which it won't. ...which it won't... ..then we walk away. Done. So, then, we have-- we have-- We have a gentleman's agreement. A gentleman's agreement. We do. May the best man win. The best man for her. For her. For the lady. For the lady, for her, the best man for her. [OPERA MUSlC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS] Oh! Uh.... Forgive me, sir. You startled me. l understand you're Savile Row's finest. We do our best, sir. ln that case, l'd like to have a suit in this fabric. Ah, South American vicuña. An excellent choice indeed. One thing with my suits, l like to know they are one of a kind. l wouldn't want anyone wearing the same suit. l'm sure you understand that. Of course, sir. with this fabric and color... ...l only made one other, and that was for a gentleman who lives quite far away. How far exactly? Los Angeles. Have you any reason to go there soon? l do now. [LlNE RlNGlNG] TUCK [ON RECORDlNG]: Hello. Sorry, I'm not in. Please leave a message after the tone. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
