THE NOOSE Eight... Krystyna? I just wanted to see you. I'll go there later on. I brought you the newspapers. Here's coffee, make yourself some. You should do something, Kuba, and not think about it all. I knew you'd come. You always come when I think about you. I was so worried about you that I decided to take the next train. I'll have plenty of time anyway. Yes... Kuba? Didn't that woman come again today? - What women? - The one that does the cleaning here. Is it possible that she did? Krystyna... I'm afraid we've accused her wrongly. I don't think she could have stolen it. Then who? After all, we looked everywhere. Please, Kuba, you deal with it. I can't do it. Besides, don't tell her anything. Just ask her not to come here anymore. All right? Yes. Krystyna... Listen, I want to tell you something. Don't say anything. Nothing is important. - Krystyna... - We'll leave this bloody city. Tomorrow we'll leave this place. And everything will change. You will see, we'll be able to live there together. You'll only be with me. Far from this city. From these people, from all of this. - And nothing will happen again. - When will you be back? After five. I'll be here by six. Kuba, it's only a few hours. Yes, I'll be waiting at home. I'm frightened when I think that there is still so much time. People will call me. Someone called again last night. I'm frightened. I wish it were over. You have to stay here and wait for me. You mustn't give in. Do you understand? I know, but I wish it was six already. Kuba! You know that I love you! I can't bear what's happening to you. - It will end! - It must stop! We can't go on like that. At least I can't. You have to understand that. Please, don't think about it. I'll come for you at six and we'll go there together. May I? Come in. You had a good time yesterday. It's ready. I mended it here. Only that stain remained. Never mind. I'm sorry, I can't pay you today. I don't have any money on me. It's been paid! That lady paid yesterday in advance. Thank you. You're welcome. There isn't much work nowadays. What? Are you not going out? No. I want to stay home for a while. Sure. Look at the weather today. Believe me Mister Kuba, there were times when I couldn't cope without it. But it's not worth it. When you think about it all, you have to give it up. Like I did. I'm telling you. It's bad for your health. Yes. I'll never stop drinking if I keep thinking about it. It will all end at six. Only, I won't be allowed to do what I want. I have to wait. Krystyna will come at six and we'll go to the clinic. She'll bring those pills for me. They wouldn't give them to me, you understand. So, she'll get them and will give them to me. I'll start my treatment. It should help, huh? - It helps some. - It will help me, too. If I don't drink for a year, people will forget about me, right? It won't take a year for them to forget. That's good. I won't drink for a year... and then I won't feel the need for it. I'll start afresh, won't I? Yes... Well, I won't take any more of your time. Goodbye. - Do you recognise me? - Of course. Lousy weather today. Looks, like it's going to rain. - It was raining at night, wasn't it? - I don't know, I didn't go out. You didn't? Were you at home? Yes, I was at home. - That's impossible. You didn't drink? - No. - You're kidding me. - I give you my word. I decided to try again. Either it works or it doesn't. - But it should work, huh? - I think so. Exactly. Some people manage, so maybe I will, too. Krystyna will come at six and... we will go to that clinic. I'll stop drinking! A year will pass, and people will forget I was a drunkard. - Won't they? - Yeah... Well... All the best! See you, Kuba! See you. Is that you, Kuba? Hello, my dear! You don't know how happy I am! What happened? Janek called me; he said you're giving up drinking. Is that true? Yes, it's true. You know how it made my life difficult. I haven't got any friends anymore. - Everybody left me. - My God, I'm so glad! Listen, Kuba, you're going with Krystyna for these pills at six, right? Yes. That's what we decided. Aha! Krystyna is a wonderful woman. She loves you so much... See, she's left you so many times... and always came back. Not every woman could stand all of that. My God, how good it is that you finally understood. Krystyna is a very brave woman. Well, I won't bother you any longer. Good luck, do you hear? - And see you! - See you. Aha, listen! What do they call those pills that you are getting? Antabus. Antabus! Antabus, Antabus... Auto-bus! I have to remember. Bye! Antabus – auto-bus! Bottles! - What do you want? - I brought the money. That's all I've managed to borrow so far. Close the door, there's a draught! I know it's a great loss. You said it was an old souvenir. You can't replace it. And I didn't take it. But I'll pay whatever is needed. Only don't take me to court. Please, leave me alone. Now, do you understand? Because, you see... It's difficult for me to pay it all at once. But... next month I'll try to bring more. Although I didn't take it, sir. Look, just leave it be! Please don't come here anymore. Do you understand? Good day! Off to work? No, I took a day off. I have something important to deal with. Whom are you kidding? I had one too many last night as well. My brother-in-law came. He had a bottle, I had a bottle. And another round... Well... you understand! The city is in bloom and we are in the gutter! Do you know Kostek, my brother-in-law? No, I don't remember him. He knows you. Don't worry. He drove you. Not once! So what? Don't you remember him? Great bloke! He always asks me, "How is that tenant from the third floor?" He likes you. He drives a taxi. Likeable guy, I'm telling you. Down to earth, knows life. If you want, we can go over there for one. No, not now. I won't have time. Well, you know how it is. We, drinking people, have to stick together. Why are you so bloody pale? Or do I imagine it? - No, you are pale. - I don't feel well. Have some sour milk, it's best after a binge. Then you have something hot to eat and you can start all over again! Pickle juice helps as well. Wait, I'll pop home, maybe I still have some. No, thank you. I'm in great hurry, bye! Look! It's early morning and he's plastered! I know him, he lives not far from here. The same house as the tailor. A drunkard. He's digging his own grave. And why are we sober, huh? How are you walking? Learn how to walk on the street! Kuba? - How are you? - Hello. Man, you don't know, how happy I am! Why? I met Wladek a moment ago. "Did you hear?" – he says. So, I asked him what I was supposed to have heard. And he goes – "Do you know, who called me today? Can you imagine? Kazio. You won't believe what he said. I thought I'd die." "Well, go on, tell me what this is all about" – I said. And he's silent for a while and then he said "He stopped drinking! That's what Kazio said. He saw him this morning. But will he make it?" So, I tell him, "Why shouldn't he?" I shut him up that way. But you will make it, huh? - I will. - That's the way! The first days will be the worst, then it's just a piece of cake. Do you remember poor Edzio? He was both, a good laugh and a big hassle. Do you remember him? A tall, slim guy that could pour many glasses in one go? My God, that was some drinking, eh? Do you remember when you offended his wife? She wanted to flirt with you and you went, "Shut up, you redheaded idiot!" Then there was a great kerfuffle, a big punch-up. You went for him and he slapped! And then we all ended up at the police station. Do you remember? My God, Kuba, those were the days! What? Can you tell me what time it is? The time? Aha, the time! Just a moment. Nearly eleven. Thank you. Yeah... Listen... - And you got sacked after that, right? - Yes, after that. You see, I think it wasn't at that time. Well, was it then or not? I don't remember. I don't remember anything. I don't want to remember, do you understand!? Why are you shouting, what's wrong? Yeah... Well, all the best. Give my regards to Krystyna. Speaking of which, the things she's got to go through with you. Listen, what do they call those pills of yours? - Pills? - The ones that you are getting? I don't know, I don't remember. Oh, there's the bus! Bye! Maybe I'll pop in in the evening, so we can talk, bye. It's not over yet, sir. I know. - What happened? - Can't you see? An accident! - What happened there? - Accident, an accident! Somebody call a doctor! Call the ambulance! Oh, my God! He was pissed. We all know that drivers drink a lot. Was he drunk? How do I know? I was passing by, just like you. Please, move away! Seven hours. I have to hold out for seven more hours. That's only a few moments... Then we'll go there, and I won't have to be afraid of time anymore. I won't be allowed to drink anymore. Even when I wake up in the middle of the night. When I can't sleep, when I'm dreaming that I'm wandering through empty streets. Then it's so easy to get drunk, but I won't drink anymore. If it's possible to go back to anything... I'll go back to life. I'll be among people. That's already a lot. Everything has to change from today. It's past noon. You see, Miss Zosia, it has cleared up. It's only temporarily. Dark clouds are coming. Now, it will rain all day. Are you going somewhere? Stop bothering me and finish with it. You can see that customers are starting to come. - Miss Zosia, coffee... - A big one. A big one. "Love is red. We sing it from the stars, like from a music sheet. We don't need telephones today, take the scissors, cut the line." No, no good! Damn it! Just listen do it! You play this chord when you hear, "Take the scissors, cut the line." Go on! "Take the scissors, cut the line. We'll say we are not home..." So fast? That's our policy, "our work speaks for us". What? Aha! You should wear this little sign on your chest. What sign? The kind you see everywhere in the city. - We have them as well. - Where? Over the counter. Have a look! "Our work speaks for us". "Drinking vodka not purchased on the premises is strictly prohibited." There are some more behind you. Thank you. "We do not serve inebriated customers." "Dogs are not allowed." - Lovely signs! - There was one more. You can see that the one about dogs is different. A few days ago, this drunkard, Lewandowski, the painter, came and broke it with his stick. My, that was a laugh! You know Lewandowski, right? You know, how loud his voice is! When he started shouting, the customers nearly run away. Get away from here! Go back to your signs! Now! - What's wrong with you today? - It's the last night. My head is killing me. Look, it's supposed to be like that - "Take the scissors, cut the line!" To hell with this telephone! All right, all right, sit down. We'll try something different. Let's see what we've got here. Maybe this one. "It must be a wonderful thing". Yes. Go on. Kuba, is that you? My God, fancy meeting you. - You're as pretty as you were then. - You're as nice as ever. How do you know? You haven't seen me in such a long time. There are people who can resist that whatever - makes others bitter. - Of course. "It must be a wonderful thing. To be with you alone... To tilt your head back..." I'm glad we've met. Really, you have no idea how happy I am. I'm very happy as well. When was the last time we met? A long time ago. About seven years ago. Then you went away. I had to. Do you still live there? I do, but a lot has changed there. Would you want to go back? You know, it's hard to say. But sometimes I felt good there. I wouldn't want to go back just to find out that the good times won't come back. Has that old church behind the square been rebuilt? Partly. Will you sit there? May I? But of course. Sit down. How are you? Tell me. I work, I live, generally everything is fine. Do you remember? Do you remember anything about those days? - Everything. - Remember me? - You as well. - That's good. I wanted that you'd remember me. A woman needs it. But I doubt that you remember everything. I sure do. Ask me anything you want. Do you remember the night you walked me home after the movies? - There were many such evenings. - But there was only one like that. Yes, that it was. I remember. You were rendering a poem then, remember? At the time, I didn't believe in that poem. "I know how unforgiving Death reaps his cruel harvest. How quickly oblivion falls. How swiftly love despairs". Why do we remember it? It's kitsch. It doesn't matter, don't stop. I would like to recall it all. I hate my memories, but I want to remember that. We were young and we didn't know what to talk about that evening by the river. Today, we probably wouldn't say anything. Never mind. I lived on a small street lined with trees. You liked to sing back then, but you were terribly out of tune. You were 21 then. Keep talking. What happened? What happened? Time. Yes... Do you know that I got married? I shouldn't be talking about it. Nothing will come back and be the same and nothing will help. You can never start life anew, only in fairy tales. I've realised that I don't love my husband. I don't know why, but I haven't left him yet. Can I tell you something funny? I loved you back then. I thought about you for a long time. Maybe it would have been better to have waited a bit longer? Why haven't you told me about it? - Back then? - Back then. "Love explains everything so beautifully, Betrayal and lie and sin. Even if you cursed it in despair, That it is cruel and wrong..." Can you give me a cigarette? Why do you smoke those nasty cigarettes? I got used to them. Why do you smoke? You didn't back then. - Have I changed a lot? - You're curious. You're wrong, only young people are curious. After that, is just repeating someone else's experiences. Why do you cling to those days so much? - I loved then. - You were silent then. If you had said just one word, everything would have been different. I was afraid. I was afraid of what people were saying. Now, I regret it. - What did they warn you about? - About vodka. They said you drink too much that you can become a drunk. I was afraid of that. I don't have good childhood memories. My father destroyed my mother's life. She was always waiting for him. He kept promising to change. Then he came back drunk. But why am I telling you all this? You don't know, and you'll never understand it. I just wanted to tell you that I loved you back then, and that I really regret that I'm not with you. You don't have to remember that. - If it's easier for you. - Forget everything. And don't regret anything. I ruined my own life. I feel sick when my husband comes anywhere near me. I cheat on that fool every other Sunday. And he doesn't even suspect. A sad, meek animal. I don't know what I'm living for if I don't love anyone. A lovely story. I've heard many of them in my life. "They were in love when they were young. And then, when they met years later, she was a whore and he was a thief". I don't care, do you understand? I don't want any memories! I don't want to regret anything! Or leave anything behind! Kuba! Are you sick? Look, that's the scum that had a go at us in the morning. He's drunk. A man slaves 15 hours a day, and this shit goes from bar to bar! To hell with him, let's go! Wait, I'll tell him what I think of him! You stupid bastard! What do you need? Nothing to eat? Nothing to wear? - Who are you getting at, you hood? - Brawling in the morning! Well, go on, hit me! - I don't care! - Stop all that! Janek, don't be silly! It's all that drunk's fault! He gave my friend a mouthful. God is my witness! Let's go for a walk. Move! You, too. It's starting early today. It's only half past two. Damn, it's late again. Don't lean on it. It's not a lamppost. Your IDs! I can explain... IDs! You'll explain later on. Name? Drunkard. - Family name? - Drunkard. - Profession... Also a drunkard? - Yes. That's nice. I'm afraid, but on your ID the name is Kowalski. That's not true. It used to be Kowalski, but that was a long time ago. And it doesn't prove anything. There're thousands of Kowalskis in this country. Sometimes they're called Kwiatkowski or Piotrowski. Or something else. But that's not important. - You've never done time, right? - No. Never mind. You'll do now. They were fighting in the street, I was doing my round. A brawl in broad daylight? Let them be. They were just pretending. Just having some fun! Cell number three, isn't it? That's right. The former number one, right? That's correct! As usual, Citizen Rybicki. Take off your coat. Go on, take it off! Sergeant! I knew it! I always get number three. Well, what was I to do? My wife died! Am I allowed to be drunk or not? Right, calm down, Rybicki! Last week you were mourning your daughter. And a month ago he was at his wife's wake. It was a really bad year for him. Well, take off your coat, Rybicki. The belt as well? Of course! You know that this is good old number three, where you go to bed without a belt. The belt can be dangerous in this condition. You could make a noose out of it. And what would happen to your wives' graves then? Who would attend to them? Yes. My luck with women was my downfall. Shoelaces as well? No, not the shoelaces. Sergeant, but I won't die in that number three? Right? Never! "You were my fiancé..." He's singing "Andalucía". As per usual. He'll have a fit in a moment. - Did you put cuffs on him? - Yes. Hands and feet. He may hurt himself. Should we call an ambulance? That'd be something, if they'd came to every alcoholic in this town. Damn it! Handcuffs, police stations, fines... What's all this for? When I was in the guerrilla, I thought that when the war was over, you'd live differently. It never crossed my mind that I'd be a police sergeant taking your belts away. To hell with all of you! It started. My God! I wish we could shut him up! Where did you get drunk? - I'm not drunk. - Nobody is drunk. It's my fault. I hit that man. What was it about? - Nothing. - So why did you hit him? I got annoyed. I could keep you here to teach you how to behave in the street, but I don't want you here today. Now, you'll probably make up. That's how it is. You are free. What's the time? We still have some time, we could go for a drink. I reckon you're all right. What time is it? Twenty-five past three. - Are you coming? - No, I don't have time. Don't bear a grudge. I don't. To hell with it all! - Is there a bar somewhere here? - Around the corner. "Under the Eagle"! - Where is it? - There! Not far! A large vodka. - A snack? - All right. Herring? - Beer? - All right. But only stout, there's no other beer now. They bring it at five, and now it is... Still early. Only half past four. Give me a stout then. But hurry up, please. Why such a hurry? In a thin or a thick glass? Doesn't matter, vodka is vodka. I'm not a drunkard. Customers have their whims. Some won't drink from a thick glass, no matter what... Anything else? No, just this drink and then - home. The end. Or you know what? Give me one more. Right away. One more! You're quite a drinker. Will you have a drink with me? Gladly. But I... I'm broke. It's on me. - Let me introduce... - I know you. - Me? - Yes. Your name is Kowalski. You're wrong. My name is... Does it matter what your name is? Or what my name is? Everyone knows us anyway. We're humans. That's a noble thing on our part. Two vodkas! - That will be six together. - That's correct. I'm ready now. All the best! All the best. Put the light on, dear. And over at the billiard table, some gentlemen are waiting. One more. One more! If you say "eight", I will take my own life today. Eight. Let's drink. You know what? Let's drink Brüderschaft. I had a hard life, believe me. I like men like you. - All right? - All right. - I'm Kuba. - I'm Wladek. Order more vodka, Wladek. It's on me! Miss! Two vodkas! Hurry up, or we'll be late for school! Drink. A day like any other day, a gloomy day like all the days A broken sink, fog behind the window. Raindrops beat against dirty windowpanes, The neighbour plays the piano lousily. Tell me dear, why aren't you here? Why is the heart... To hell with it... I like songs like that. Only vodka will let you forget... You play nicely. I really like songs like that. - Shall I play you "François"? - No. I hate waltzes. What about "Tamara"? What about something else? I can explain dreams. Do you hear, Wladek? He can explain dreams. Yeah... I had a strange dream. If you could explain this dream to me... I think such a dream happens once in a lifetime. Keep talking... The accordionist will explain everything to you! Yeah... It was a strange dream. I dreamt that... I was a drunk. That my name was Kowalski. That there was a phone in my apartment. Do you get it? I dreamt that I wanted to forget about my drinking. To leave the people whom I drank with, to leave the pubs, my memories... This is what sometimes happens in a dream, right? But in a dream, you cannot escape anything... And this is the worst. Such a dream is very exhausting. And I dreamt many other things... A country... A strange one. A difficult, heavy country. A country where you have to work so much, have to have so much hope and heart... That's my worst dream... A horrible dream. But it's just a dream, right? I don't think it's possible in real life. After all, life isn't that cruel, right? You shouldn't have bad dreams. What can you do to forget? Drink some vodka and it will pass. Everything passes. There isn't a worse dream than life and that passes, too. Excuse me, I have to go and play. Customers are waiting. Beer, Ma'am! Make space! Five o'clock... Aren't you feeling well? Are you sick? No! I've never felt as good as now! Wladek? What do decent people do at five, at five p.m.? They go home... Work... Read... Play with their kids. Bollocks, my man! I'm asking you... I'm asking, what do decent people do at five in the evening? At five in the evening, decent people drink straight vodka. The one with a red label, in the bar "Under the Eagle". Under the Eagle. Miss! Two vodkas for us! Just a moment! There used to be a poster there - "Sleep peacefully, the police is awake". But I don't remember the picture. Give us those two vodkas. How do you know that? I've been drinking here for many years. I've seen many different people in this bar. You've no idea, how many. Right, Miss? And what good came out of it? Not everything has to always have a happy ending. After all, it would be too boring. Yes or no? Men... Who are you? Just a Pole. Don't be silly, tell me who you are. Who I was. You're drunk. It doesn't matter. I'm your dear friend from the bar "Under the Eagle". That's enough. Why do you drink? That doesn't matter either. We, who drink, we know it doesn't matter why. Maybe I'm lonely. Maybe a hooker, I cannot live without, cheated on me. It's not important. There's no such misfortune, loneliness, no woman... for whom it is worth to drink. But only those, who lost everything because of drinking, know about it. Those, who have to drink. Those who are just starting have no idea. Vodka is the truth... that is always understood when it is too late. I had a bad day. Today I had a bad day in this town. But it is over. I have one more hope to hold on to. Let's have a drink, Wladek. Yeah... It's good that you have hope. I don't. I don't believe there is a way out of this hell. There is nothing! I started out just like that boy over there. Love, betrayal, all that shit. I used to be the best saxophone player in this country. A saxophone player? You? A saxophone player? You don't look like a saxophone player. But I was! Don't you believe me? Nobody played here like I did! Well, so what? Nothing. And then what? Also, nothing. So, why are you telling me this? I'm not telling you. I'm speaking. Then speak! What is the end? The end is important. The punch line, do you understand? I'm no longer the best saxophone player. That's enough. If all people could talk about their stupid life so briefly, it would be much better. But... if you want to tell me your story, by all means... Tell me. I really like enlightening life stories. Mine is short. I was in love... Now, that's something new. She left me... And then? I'm no longer the best saxophonist in this town. In this town... there isn't a single good saxophone player. They all play lousy. Forget it man. Forget it! If you want to drink a beer, don't buy the whole brewery! It will all pass like a bad dream, I'm telling you. Gienek! Gienek! Go after them! Even if he gets that girlfriend of his... their happiness will end quickly if the lover doesn't stop drinking. That poor stupid girl will follow him... drag him out of the pubs, away from his friends... How do you know that? It always comes to that if a woman starts caring for a drunkard, whom she loves. I had a woman who once loved me. And what? The hospital... I went there, because she wanted it... But what about her? Go away! She left. One day she finally left... and, luckily, never came back. She was a good woman. It's all for nothing. What do you mean? The one who drinks will keep drinking. It's a game without a finishing line. First is Antabus, vitamins, talking to the doctors, who can treat only horses... Then... a madhouse... A white room, which you are not allowed to leave. The four walls and you. Your memories, your hangovers... You can cry, beat your head against the wall, swear, pray... but you won't get the key. Always that white room... and memories, memories, memories. Day and night, day and night... Various people come to you at night... But... When you reach out to them, there is nothing there. And you are alone again. When the doctors come to see you, you beg them to let you out! - Stop it! - You kiss their hands! Stop it! But you can beg all you want, scream day and night, night and day! You can swear on your knees that you have changed and that you have a strong will... They check your pulse and leave. But people get out of there! Yeaaah! But only to go back in. You are lying! I was there and I will be there! There will be white rooms again, until finally the day will come, when I won't need anything or feel anything. I will turn into a pile of stupid, rotting meat. But before that happens, there'll be still many, many, many... Gienek! Gienek! What? Let's go! Quiet, gentlemen. Calm down! Nothing's happened! Nothing happened! Mister Poldek! Play the song "A day for a day"! To hell with him! Check his pockets! Nothing so far. Damn it! If you don't have money, you scum, go to a church, not to a pub! Well? I've got it! - Enough? - I think so! What else have you got? I don't know. Have a look. Did he steal it? I don't think so, he's not the sort. Leave it. It's probably not worth much, and it can get us into trouble. Let's get out of here, leave him here. Then he'll be back. See if anyone is coming. I'll make sure that he goes straight home. Oh shit, it's going to rain again. Go away! Mister Kuba! Don't you recognise me? It's me, Kostek! You've had one too many! Here, have a drag. It will help. Where... are they? Those people? They left. I know you. You are Kostek. That's right! Come on! I'll drive you home. Krystyna, is that you? I've been waiting for you a very long time. Give me the key. Go inside. I'll be back in a minute. Please, do. I was drinking. I was drinking. I'll wipe your hands. I was drinking. I'll make you coffee. I was drinking. Have I slept long? No, only a minute. Drink while it's hot. - Do you want to know how it was? - No. They kept calling me from the very morning. I had to go out. I'll go now. Are you leaving? I'm going. I'll come tomorrow morning. First thing in the morning. What time? - What time? - At eight. And then? You'll go for that treatment. Krystyna! It won't help! - We will try. - For how long? Until the end. Nothing will come of it. Go away. Go and come back no more. Pity is a lousy feeling. Kuba, listen to me carefully. I'll come tomorrow morning, after eight. I'll ring three times. Then you will open. Only then! If anybody else comes here, don't open. When you first came here, you were speaking differently. You looked different. It will never be like that again. Don't open to anyone. And remember - three times. Krystyna! Don't go, I'm scared! You know that I have to go. Sleep well, Kuba. Until tomorrow. There you are, you slut! Good day to you. - Hello? - Kuba? - Yes. - Kuba, Kuba... That's, that's... We talked yesterday morning and you said yourself, "it's over". It's over. And in the evening, I find out that you were seen drunk, rolling in the streets. We want to help you! We all want to help you! We want to save you, save your talent, your love! But you were drinking again. Tough luck. You can't be trusted! Drunkards cannot be trusted! Don't be angry that I say so, but who else would tell you the truth? You see... And I was so sure about you. What does that make me look like? What does that make me look like... Eh, it's nothing. It's just a shame, that the picture got damaged. It's a shame. I knew you'd come. You always come when I'd rather not think about you. You know, that my life will slowly turn into hell. An addiction to eternal waiting, poisoning every moment of my solitude. You don't know what vodka is. You don't know. You don't. You don't. You don't know that awful feeling... That fear that chokes my brain... when I think that all is not lost yet... that I can go back and start over... even though I know that I'm falling apart... I walked into a void. I'm weak. Bloody weak. I will never be able to fight the world, to crush obstacles, work, love, live... To live... the pure life of a man. I have to get away from here. Get away from memories, from the fools... who have lost track of time and are concerned only with regulating their watches. Good that you are with me now. You know yourself, that I have to go there. I will never have to be afraid of questions or words again. I will never have to fear time again. I will go there. And the whole world will cease to exist in an instant. It has to be.
