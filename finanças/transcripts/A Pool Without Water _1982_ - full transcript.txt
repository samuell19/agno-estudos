Didn't you feel it? If the policeman asks me, maybe I can think I felt it. It's true, I had the feeling I was being penetrated there by a stranger. When I woke up, I had a slight headache. But it was like a dream, and at the same time, it wasn't a dream. One thing is certain, though. While I was sleeping, I had the feeling I was making love. However, maybe because of the heat, I'm in the habit of taking off my panties when I sleep. So I can't be certain, as you say, Inspector, that I got naked for this man whom I don't know. I'm upset. When I woke up, there were no suspicious traces on my private parts, nor any gelatinous liquid on the ï¬‚oor. As for the stains on the sheet, I find them when I have trouble sleeping...

Thank you very much. I'm very grateful. Here, take this. And this. There's nothing in the house. Do you want some ginger ale? Yes, please. - Do you live alone? - No, with a friend. Thank you. Be careful when you go out alone. Yes. What's your name, anyway? Nin-nin niki-niki Stop! Let me do it. No! It fell down! I said, stop it! Let me. No. Next one! Come and get it! Yes. You'll be late. Hey! Wait. Show me your ticket. What? You punch holes? Loser! Here he is. What are you doing here, dammit! Samurais are allowed anything? Hear me? Listen, sir. I'm a man of the people. You, too! You hear? What do you want? Don't look at me like that, with those samurai eyes. Sir! What? Don't shout. - What? - You're disturbing the other customers. You're not allowed to talk in this bar? Tell me. - I want to talk. So? - You're always the same. What do you mean? Doesn't matter. The others are having a pleasant evening. So what? You're such a pain! I pay you, don't I? - Please. - Are you mad at me? Here. They're Yakuzas. You let in Yakuzas? You let them in? Excuse me. Dammit, you're pissing me off! Want that? Sir! Who do you think you are? Stop! Don't interfere. Stop. Sorry for the disturbance. Thank you very much. Miku? Good evening. Mister! Be careful. You get attacked because you're not careful. You should also take precautions at home. What if I was a bad guy? Sorry. What happened to your hand? It's nothing. - Make sure you close the window. - Okay. Good night. You deadbeat! With that wounded hand of yours you can't even hold the hole punch! Working in the subway isn't for you. I'll screw you good! What language! Move. Employment Five Spirits Sincerity, Respect, Effort, Perfectionism, Reflection Sorry to keep you waiting. Follow me. This way. Come in. Excuse us. Sit down. If I may... You probably wouldn't understand, but soon we'll acquire the right of arrest, and will be able to replace the police. Informing on suspects and delivering them to the police, that's what we do. It's amazing! Do you understand? In practice, we'll be the Japanese police. Our society deserves it. If you do well in our company, your future is guaranteed. You'll be able to live hand in hand with the Japanese state. Any questions? Well... Surely you have questions? All the other interviewees wanted to know everything. Come on, questions! Well... I thought... that a guard's job was just to patrol at night and that I could avoid any human contact. Excuse me? I mean... After having worked in the ticket office, I can't stand crowds anymore. I thought... I didn't want to do this job all my life. And on top of that I had to clean up the drunks' puke... Okay, okay. I get it. No need to have such a crappy job. With the right of arrest, you could get rid of all the indesirable passengers. Living hand in hand with the state means living a happy, prosperous life. They seem prosperous, don't they? You're hired! You're very strong-minded Thank you in advance. It's you! Thanks for the other day. Here you are. Here. How great, to work in the subway! You think so? Yes. I love trains. When I was little, I wanted to be a conductor in the bullet train. My parents thought it too masculine, and scolded me. - You're still a child. - How so? I'm still a child, too. You're what's left of the child. If you like. When I was a kid, I dreamed of being a conductor. We have things in common. Indeed. I'd forgotten about that. I mustn't have any regrets. I'm doing what I dreamed of as a child. I should know I'm fulfilled. What do you mean? You sleep with your windows closed? Sorry about the other night. Hello. Miku, you're home! See you. Mister! Look. He gave me this. It's the man I told you about, who saved me in the park. He's really nice. Yummy food! Yummy food! Don't fall asleep. You'll become cows! Moo, moo! Daddy, our vacation's nearly over. Take us somewhere. I want a collection of insects. I hate insects. Here's an insect! Stop it, big brother! Quiet! Okay, I've made up my mind. We'll go tomorrow. Yes! - Good evening. - Good evening. Right... He's not moving anymore? No. And he won't rot, either. Don't touch. He's still alive, you know. He's still alive... Is the insect dead? Shush! Be quiet! He'll wake up. - Sorry. - Mommy. Here, Emi, your panties. Lift your foot. There. You got some sun. Tonight you go to bed early, okay? I'm a professor at the Kita college next door. I need materials for a science experiment, a large quantity of chloroform. No problem. Do you have a signature seal? Yes. Is mine okay? My name is Yamashita. Put down your name and address, here. You saved me. I need a whole lot of it. I checked at the school, but they were out. The suppliers were on vacation. It's for vivisections of frogs? Chloroform Luxury Condoms Thank you. Welcome. Hello. What will you have? - Ginger ale. - Coming up. Excuse me. Here. It'll be hot and humid tonight. My place is nice and cool. I live in a house. It's hot upstairs, but not on the ground floor. You live alone? Isn't the rent too high? Actually, I don't pay anything. My brother and his wife went abroad for three years. Aren't you afraid to be alone in a house? Not at all. Nerika, you can go home now. See you, then. Have a good evening. - See you. - See you. Yes, that's her. Welcome. What will you have? A medium. One medium! Here you are. What a refreshing morning! What? Who is it? - Hi. - The man from the subway! Why so early in the morning? I wanted to know how you were. You don't look so well. Well... I have a bit of a headache. You left your window open again. How did you know? - Why don't we go have some tea? - Okay. Hello. What will you have? - A ginger ale. - The same. She's beautiful. Do you know her? Not at all. You want a girl like her, don't you? What's wrong with you? Headache? I had a weird dream. A nightmare? It was chaotic, I can't remember it. As though I was walking on clouds. Who's there? Is anyone there? Yoshio? It can't be Yoshio, or Takashi. No one knows this address. It's 9:40. Nerika's late. So it appears. She's always late. Sorry I'm late. - Hello. - Hello. Tell me... Did you come over to my place last night? Of course not. We don't know where you live! - Right? - Absolutely. - You're right. - Did something happen? No, nothing. Why doesn't he come? I'm waiting for him. Sorry. Forgive me for being late. I was early. How about a movie? Good idea. A ginger ale. The juices are in the vending machine. Ginger ale isn't a juice. You bitch! What's wrong with you?! Stop it! How dare you chat up my girlfriend! I didn't know. It was obvious! Asshole! Who could it be? Takashi? Yesterday he left without saying a word. Could he have found me? I see... Hello? Hello? Is Takashi there? Takashi, who just got out of the police academy. That's it. Me? I'm Nerika. Takashi! Telephone! It's Nerika. Tell her I'm not here. I don't want to talk to her. Hello? As though Santa Claus had come. Excuse me. Which newspaper are you subscribed to? I'm offering you gifts... You can take everything right now. Is it for your work? Yes. For science experiments. Uchida! You're in charge of cleaning. Don't you disappear. What are you looking at? Show me. I said, show me! - Stop it! - Come on. - What the hell... - Stop it! You bastard! Think I'm stupid? Loser! Want me to beat you up? All you do is bum around all day! And you buzzed your head. Look at you! He looks cool! Time for bed. Why did you leave your job? What will become of us? The colleague you beat up wasn't fired. Only you left. Tell me. You don't want to work anymore, is that it? Where are you going? Deadbeat! Welcome. Hello. What are you having? - A ginger ale. - Okay. Nerika, aren't you feeling well? No, it's nothing. Excuse me, can I have some water, please? Yes. Would you like to sleep over at my place tonight? Really? Will you come, too? I'd love to! Welcome. Thank you. 550 Yen. Water. Yes. Here's 450 Yen change. Thanks a lot. Where are you going? You go out every night. You haven't found work yet, have you? What do you mean? I do surveillance work. How much do you make? It's for the city. I patrol the city in order to protect each citizen from thieves, sexual perverts, pollution and traffic accidents. It's political. In politics, there's no fixed salary. One day, we'll make a lot of money. A member of parliament hired you? It's politics. What are you talking about? Politics? One day, we'll make a lot of money? What are you on about! Help! Quick! Someone! A pervert broke into the house! Help! Quick! ...or any gelatinous liquid on the floor. As for the stains on the sheet, I find them when I have trouble sleeping. Therefore I cannot be sure that it is what the inspector said it was. Write down your name and address. Do you have your signature seal? A thumbprint will do. Sign here. Mister. I want to withdraw it. Excuse me? What do you mean? I don't consider myself a victim. No one will come anymore. Had the girls kept quiet, there'd be hot water ready in the morning. Was it my fault? I was worried... For too many wonderful things had happened.
