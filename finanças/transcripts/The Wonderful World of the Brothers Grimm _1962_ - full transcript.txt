(male narrator) Early in the 1800's, the fearful sounds of war once again shook the heart of Europe. Not far from the field of battle, there was another sound soft and gentle. Yet, it has echoed down the years to be heard long after the guns were stilled and the battles forgotten. If you listen closely, you can hear it... now. Well, Grimm. How goes the work today? Mr. Grubber! Forgive me. I-I didn't know you were here. Does my presence disturb you? Your hands are trembling. My brother has not been feeling wel I, Mr. Grubber. His health is really not-- And he still continues to work. What heroic devotion to duty! It's nothing. On the contrary, Grimm. On the contrary, His Grace, the Duke would be most grateful. And find ways to show it. Eh, may I examine the fruits of your labor? But it isn't complete. You rather wait until the entire manuscript. No! No. "And as he fell "he ceased to be a frog and turned into a prince with beautiful, kind eyes." And where does this event occur in the Duke's family history? Hm? Well, I-I heard this little story and, while it was fresh in my mind I, I thought I'd borrow just a few minutes. - Borrow? - Borrowed. You cal I it borrowing , do you? Stealing! You are stealing from the duke who's paying you to write his family history. When you steal from the duke, you are committing a crime of which he could put you behind bars like any other thief. 'Oh, need I say more, gentlemen?' [mellow music] Don't be angry, Jacob. Anger poisons the mind and sours the stomach. Wilhelm, these are perilous times. Work is hard to find, money is scarce. I swear, word of honor. I'm a reformed man. You have a responsibility, your wife, your children. You are rig ht, absolutely. You see, I heard this-this wonderful, wonderful story from the old flower vendor.. I don't want to hear it. ...about this beautiful young princess playing with a golden ball. The ball falls into the well and-and she thinks it's lost. When suddenly, a frog offers to fetch it up for her but only if she'll invite the frog for dinner. - And then, she-- - Wilhelm! - Off to the clouds again. - The poor moonstruck ninny. The whole world on fire and he can't even smell the smoke. Forgive me, ladies, but I do smell the smoke and the gunpowder. True, the whole world is at war 'blood is flowing everywhere.' Wilhelm! Real blood, ladies. Not dragon's blood, which isn't harmful. Nor witch's brew, which can turn an old hag into a beautiful young princess. That is my world, dear ladies. If you prefer yours, I beg you keep it with my fond blessings and a cordial good day. [laughter] I honestly believe his mind is going. Gone, my dear. Never to return. That was the last gasp from the old Wiilhelm. From now on you'll see. Jacob, Jacob Grimm! You see what he wants. I'll go and buy the bread. Alright, but hurry. We are late already. Jacob, come here! Mr. Grimm. Don't you want to buy a rose? No. No, no, thank you. I have another one for you, Mr. Grimm. A darling story. No. No more stories. ...about the funny little man who spins gold out of straw. Spins gold out of straw? No. No, no. How does it go? A pretty girl is locked in the king's castle. "Spin this straw into gold ," he says. "Or you will die." Such a sweet story. Yes, yes. Go on, go on. That's a little better. Now, if you could possible manage to look a little less gloomy, eh? If you've cal led me to criticize my appear-- No, my friend Jacob, no. Your gloominess is only a symptom. Now the diagnosis. Too much work, no pleasure, too many hours alone. Look, I feel fine. Don't be absurd. Symptom, diagnosis, and now the cure. - I must.. - Ms. Greta Heinrich. May I present Mr. Jacob Grimm? I don't believe it. A man so young? Why, I saw you on the street, and it never entered my mind that you could be Jacob Grimm author of all these marvelous works. Well, I.. That is not precisely true, I.. ...collaborate with my brother. Ah, the married brother? Yes. You will be thrilled to know that Ms. Heinrich has bought one of your books. One that you wrote all by yourself. I can't wait to read it. " Legal Antiquities?" A marvelous choice. Old laws are so much nicer than new ones, sir. I told Ms.-Ms. Heinrich if she waited, the author would write something in the book. Yes, but what should I write? Anything. Respectfully. Sincerely. Affectionately. Will it be alright if I just signed my name? Oh, oh, of course. It's not the words but the thought that counts. Ms. Heinrich is visiting from Berlin with her aunt. Doesn't know a soul in town. There are many young people here. She won't be lonely. Ah! Well, thank you, Mr. Grimm. You are very kind. Not at all. Jacob? Jacob, look, I want to talk to you. My brother Wilhelm, Ms. Greta Heinrich. - Delighted. - Mr. Grimm. - Wilhelm. - Stoneless. I do hope we'll I see each other again. - It's inevitable. - Oh, really? In such a small town, one's always seeing everyone else. Oh ! Oh, yes, yes, of course. - Goodbye. - Good bye, Ms. Heinrich. Thanks very much for coming in. Good day, Mr. Stoneless. Oh! Well, what's the matter? Your muttonhead brother. I introduce him to a charming girl who goes out of her way to buy one of his dull books-- To you, they may be dull. To everyone. Look here. German grammar, volume one. German grammar, volume two. Analysis of German grammar. As a good friend , I give them space. As a better friend, I say to you "Write books people will buy." Write about girls. - Oh, about, you mean? - No. I mean about.. Hm, hm, hm. But what do I know about girls? Nothing. About everything that's important you know nothing. Stoneless , don't you dare talk to my brother like that. Jacob is the wisest most kind, most generous-- Where is the bread? The bread? Yes, uh, Jacob, I wanted to talk to about that. So, you bought an another story From that villainess flower vendor and the bread money is gone. Just this once if you'll lend me some money, I promise.. What, I swear. (both) Word of honor, never again. You see? He's a prince among men. He's a fool. Next to you the biggest fool in the world. But it's not too late to change. For me, for your dearest friend, please. Write about girls. Jacob, write about girl .. [instrumental music] We are already 57 minutes late. I hope you have an explanation. Have you ever known me when I haven't had an explanation? Look, the reason we are late.. ...is we stopped to buy our roses. We stopped? Our roses? After all, you paid for them. Besides, you stopped to force your attentions on a pretty girl. I paid for the bread. Oh, no, no. I insist, I insist. You take half a credit for the roses and half the blame for being late. Daddy, daddy. Will you hear what happened? Run in. Come on, go on. Go on. Help! Help, help, help. 'Savages, mad dogs.' Help! Save me. Ooh ! Ah-ah, ah-ah! Now, my little kids, it's my turn. You'll pay and pay dearly. I will grind your bones and slit open these eyes. And for you, my dear, I have other plans-- Where have you been? For one whole hour the dinner's been kept waiting. What kept you? Oh, what's this, Wilhelm? A tribute to your kind, sweet, gentle, beauteous mi-- Where is the bread? Bread? What bread? Children, go and wash your hands. Will you? I gave you money for bread instead of which you come back with.. What am I to do? I don't have two children, I have.. Jacob, you should know better. We've barely enough money for.. ...the bread. You didn't forget the bread? No, Dorothea, he didn't forget. And don't you forget. Men does not live by bread alone. That's a strange sentiment from you. It's not from me. It's from "The Bible." And from Stossel's book shop. You see.. ...a young lady came in and bought one of his books today. Asked him to write in it. A very beautiful young lady, eh, Jacob? I-I didn't notice. Well, she obviously noticed you. What was her name? - Do I know her? - Um.. Rita Albrecht. Greta Heinrich. You see? That's our Jacob for you. Can't remember a face, but never forgets a name. If dinner is ready, why don't we eat? Ooh, right away. They are lovely. They are just lovely. It's my turn. It is not. It's my turn. It was your turn yesterday. No, it was your turn yesterday. How can it be your turn today if it was yours yesterday? Children. You may share the honor. (both) Bless us, O Lord and these gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Grubber. That shriveled husk. He doesn't know the meaning of the word "happy." And as for our gracious, patron, the noble duke-- Someone might hear you and tel I him. Good. It might reduce his bloated ego. Might also throw us out of this house which he gives us rent-free. - Might also put you in jail. - You are right. And so are you. The duke doesn't want scholars, he wants toadies to sing the glories of his illustrious name. So that he can be a toady to a king of Prussia. However, we need the money, so, to work. No, Jacob, I'll go to work. I'm gonna make up for the borrowed time. Well, don't look so surprised. I'm a reformed man. Well, don't disturb the children. The children would be wise not to disturb me. What was he doing to make Grubber angry, hm? Jacob, what was he doing? Just being himself. [children giggle] [dog barking] [giggling continues] Not here? Now, let me see. They must be there, huh? Boo! (both) Fooled you. We fooled you. Shh. Now, that's enough. To bed, come on. And to sleep instantly. Come on, come on. We want a story. No, absolutely not. - Oh, papa, just one. - No. - No more stories. - No more stories? Not never? Not "ne. ." Not ever. You should be studying your grammar. Not never. Why, that's atrocious grammar. Oh, grammar's too hard. Nothing's too hard, son, nothing. If you want it badly enough, you'll get it. Now, remember the Woodsman. What he wanted was impossible, nevertheless-- What Woodsman? Well, you know the Woodsman, who lived the forest all alone. - What did he want so bad ly? - 'How did he get it?' Well, it happened on the day, a very special day. He decided to embark on a great adventure. A journey far from the forest that was his home. ♪ I dream of winning a princess ♪ ♪ La-la-la la-la-la la ♪ Ah. Mwah. Mwah.

Return before dawn. 'Or the king will surely find out.' Coachman, have you seen him? A man with a mask? No. princess. I have seen no one. But there is another man waiting at the castle that you must marry if you are late. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! 'Ha! Ha !' Hyah! You tried, and you failed! How sad ! Too bad ! Uh, get to work! Just a moment. [scoffs] Your Majesty I know how the princess wears holes in her slippers. I don't believe it. Not a word. Princess! Princess. 'Where does she walk?' Nowhere. She dances. All night. Fiddlesticks ! Alone in her bedroom? No. She goes through a hidden door and then rides this carriage-- Oh, oh, I got you now. I know every hidden door, secret room in then sliding palace in the panel. The panel, panel in the.. And no botheration. Off with his head. Ha-ha-ha. Wait a minute now. Now wait a minute. Let me, let me explain. I am the king , you.. Now, let me show ya. Nobody tel ls me anything. Oh, you see? He guessed your secret. Every night, dancing and prancing. I love to dance but.. ...nobody asks me. Well, a, a bargain is a bargain. So, now we'll have a great, big party. There'll be no party. I shall never marry him. Ta-ta-ta-tat, my girl. You're not the king. You're only a princess, which isn't as good. Besides, I gave my word. And last night, I gave my heart. To a stranger. And they lived happily ever after. [dog squealing] (Wilhelm) Shh. Well.. I gave them a severe talking to about their grammar. Mm-hmm. Well, I told them one story. A story that will give them nightmares. Oh, no, no, it was a beautiful story. About the dancing princess and the woodsman. - You mean the tailor? - Tailor? The, the way you heard it, it was a tailor? The way I heard it, you were a reformed man. Well, you aren't. You're absolutely beyond redemption. All I can say for you is.. ...I love you. I, uh.. I have work to do. The work is almost done. Go to bed. What is your object? To make me feel guilty? My object is to finish this wretched thing on time. Mm-hmm. By the way.. ...you remember the story of the dancing princess? Whom did she marry? A woodsmen or a tailor? - A farmer. - A farmer? An honest, conscientious, hard working farmer. A farmer. - It was a fisherman. - A fish.. How do you know? Because I'm a man of infinite wisdom who has heard the story a thousand ti mes. But that's terrible. Tailor, woodsman, farmer, fisherman. Four different versions. - Now isn't that terrible? - It is terrible. Come on. You know, that proves my point. These stories should be written down. Better you should write about girls. Talking about girls.. - Ms. Greta Heinrich. - Yeah? Will you tel I her something for me? [inaudible whispering] Wilhelm! - 'We'll be late.' - I'll be there. I'll be delighted. It was a delicious dinner, Mrs. Grimm. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Won't you sit here, Ms. Heinrich? Oh, thank you. Oh. [giggling] Uh, we hope, Ms. Heinrich.. ...Jacob and all of us that you like our town. Oh, I do. The people are so friendly. Must seem very quiet to you after Iivi ng in Berlin. Still, we hope, uh, Jacob and all of us that you won't hurry away. Well, it was to have been just a short visit. But I wouldn't mind staying indefinitely. - Wilhelm, it's getting late. - Get the children, um.. - It's time to go to bed now. - Come along now. Say good night to Ms. Heinrich. - Good night, Ms. Heinrich. - Good night, Uncle Jacob. (both) Goodnight, Uncle Jacob. - That's right. Run along . - Come on, off you go to sleep. Your children are charming, Mr. Grimm. Thank you. Children are a specialty of the Grimm family. We hope that yours will be equally as, uh-- Yes, well, uh.. It's getting late. I think, I'll go on up too. Oh, stay! And talk a while with us. Tel I Ms. Heinrich one of your stories. Wilhelm has a very fertile imagination. - Oh, really? - Oh, yes. You would hardly believe what fantastic thoughts occur to him. Go ahead, Wilhelm. 'Let us have one of your stories.' Funny, I just can't seem to remember any. Oh, they come and go, slip away. It's a pity there isn't someone to write them down. Oh, well. Goodnight. Goodnight. It was most kind of you to take pity on a stranger and invite me here. To be honest, it was not I who invited you. I thought.. Well, that-that is, I was given the impression 'that it was your idea.' Say yes. (Jacob) In all honesty, no. It's a rare experience, Mr. Grimm to meet a man so honest. I shan't inquire whether you wish to take me home, but since it's getting late-- But, uh.. Honesty, Ms. Heinrich, requires the whole truth. Although it was not my idea I'm very glad you were invited here. Equally glad that you accepted. [giggling] (Greta) 'Tell me about your work, Mr. Grimm.' - 'Oh, I--' - No, Jacob. Don't, please. I'd like to ask you a question, Ms. Heinrich. A rather personal question. How did you like my book? How I was enchanted. Enchanted? By "Legal Antiquities?" Oh, well, the subject isn't important. (Jacob) 'I beg your pardon.' (Greta) 'What enchanted me was the tremendous' 'knowledge and Intelligence it took to write such a book.' Forgive me, Mr. Grimm, but.. ...I must be honest too. You are a brilliantly fascinating man. Nonsense. 'I'm a conscientious scholar' 'dedicated to his work, that's all.' Aah! [birds chirping] Grubber! Your Grace, if this portrait is to grace the cover of your grace's family history may I ask that, Your Grace, face this way. And smile. Grubber! Sir? You've finished reading it, Your Grace? Have the Brothers Grimm done you proper justice, Your Grace? Are you pleased, Your Grace? You're very good at asking questions, now answer one. Do I look pleased? Ohh. Get those brothers, and bring them here! Stoneless. You've always been a good , true, loyal, and dear friend. Uh, good morning, dear ladies. Now I'm going to give you a chance to prove it. May I prove it later? I'm waiting on these dear ladies. Oh, what are they looking for? Mr. Stoneless knows my taste. Who doesn't? Ah, just the thing. "History of the 100 Years War." Every page reeking with blood and gore. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Really, Wilhelm, come on. Listen, we've just finished writing the Duke's family history. Now I can concentrate on collecting and writing stories. - Stories about girls? - Oh, Stoneless, you worry me. A, a priceless literary heritage is dying. Now unless these wonderful fairytales are written down and published , they'll soon be forgotten. Now, look, you know a man called Dantino. Dantino, yes, the foremost publisher in Berlin. - A good, true and loyal friend. - Yes, yes. I'm sure he'd agree that you are a complete looney. A looney. Who'd want such a book? Anyone with a desire to be happy. I would. - They would . - They? Who are they? You, you, you, and you. Come on, come inside. Really, they should lock him up. He's dangerous. Shh. Now. Now, don't be frightened . I just want to ask. Do you want a book of fairytales? - No, sir. - Hup! Of course you do. Why not? I can't read. - Well, you can hear, can't you? - Yes. Alright then. Ah, ah, come here. Wilhelm, what are you doi ng? Sit down. Madam. My dear. If you please. And not another word out of anyone. 'Now, listen.' Once upon a time.. ...there was a cobbler. An old, old cobbler. He had snowy white hair. A big thick mustache. Bushy eyebrows riding on a sea of wrinkles. He worked very hard. Day in and day out. But for various reasons his customers were not pleased. - Cobbler! - Yes? Oh, your honor, the mayor. Are my shoes ready? Uh, not yet, Your Excellency-- Not yet? Why, the King's Christmas party is tomorrow afternoon. If my shoes aren't ready, it will go on with you. Oh, to be sure, Your Worship, but-- No buts. I shall return tomorrow morning.

What is the question? I shan't expect an immediate answer. A decision like this cannot be made instantly. What's the question? Will you marry me? - When? - When? - You mean you will? - Well, of course. Without even thinking? Oh, Jacob. The first time I saw you I knew I was going to fall in love with you. Amazing. I have fallen in love with you. And more than anything in the world I would like to marry you. Are there any more questions? Just one. May I kiss you? Of course. Very well.

The said family history to be dedicated and presented to His Majesty, the King of Prussia on the forthcoming anniversary of his coronation. [sneezes] What are you doing? I'm just sneezing, Your Grace. Don't touch that. It's priceless. Yes, sir. Uh, this is the complete history? Yes, Your Grace. And may I point out that we finished two days early? May I point out you chopped off one whole branch of my family? The Rhineburg branch, represented by my third cousin 'Baron Ulrich of Rhineburg !' (Jacob) 'Yes, sir but I thought--' (The Duke) 'I don't pay you to think, I pay you to write.' A point of fact, sir, you haven't paid us at all. Ha! The minstrel speaks. The tale teller who steals my time to collect frogs and dogs, hags and dragons haven't paid you, huh? Have I given you a house for six months rent-free? - Yes, but, um. . - Yes, but.. You will receive no money until you fulfi ll your contract. Now, then you thought what, my illustrious scholar? Well, sir. In your library, there's very little about the Rhineburgs. And in fact, it not very flattering. For example, the behavior of Baron Ulrich at the Battle of-- (The Duke) 'That's a lie!' [clattering] Perhaps, but he is such a distant relative. Baron Ulrich is a nephew by marriage of His Majesty, the King of Prussia. I see, sir. Well.. We'll be back at work first thing in the morning. First thing in the morning you'll take the boat to Rhineburg. In the cathedral archives, you'll find all names and dates. 'Baron Ulrich himself will correct all lies.' But-but this is very difficult for us to.. We've only two days left and I doubt that we can finish in time. Oh, you will. Because if you don't, I'll throw you out of your house and into debtors prison. Where I will make it difficult for you beyond anything you can possibly imagine. What are you doing? - I'm-I'm so sorry, Your Grace. - Go! Purely unintentionally, Your Grace. - Go! - I apologize, Your Grace. Go! Go!

It's been a pleasure delving into the past with you. You were bored to death, Mr. Grimm. And I respect you for it. Nothing is quite so dull as digging up obscure names and dates which should be allowed to rest in oblivion. Give me young living voices singing "Mozart." [singing continues] - Father? - Pay no attention. - Today is Friday. - Friday? (Wilhelm) 'Oh, yes, yes, so it is.' [singing continues] Every Friday as long as anyone can remember the children of Rheinberg have been invited to visit Anna Richter. There are some who call her a witch. Do you believe in witches, Mr. Grimm? - Witches? - Oh, you don't! I should've thought you did. Well, uh.. Yes, as a matter of fact, I, um.. Well, she is no witch. She only has the power to bewitch and beguile and create a world of beauty that even Mozart would envy. She tel ls the most wonderful fairy tales ever heard. Fairy tales! Is, uh, is that where they're going? [clears throat] Shh! Father! When I was his age I used to do the same thing every Friday. I'd gladly do it again right now, but it's too late. Only children are invited. Um.. Well, I-I must be going. You've been most helpful . A mil I ion thanks, goodbye. Goodbye. - What do you want? - Good afternoon, ma'am. My name is Wilhelm Grimm. I've heard that-- You've heard that I'm a witch, I suppose. Have you come to scoff and jeer like everybody else. No, quite the contrary. If I may, I'd-I'd very much like to come inside. I won't have it. Go away. [Wilhelm groans] Your foot is in my door. Yes, I'm.. I'm so sorry. Might I just come in and sit quietly and listen? I-- Children only. Oh, but I'm much younger than I look. Ah, people tell me that.. [kids shouting] You little monkey, you were late. My mama made me take a nap. Well, I hope it did you good. Now, my young scamps. What should we have? - Witches! - Dragons! [indistinct shouting] Settle down ! Settle down! Which of you would like to laugh today? Uh.. I can see, you'd rather I made your blood run cold. Yes! Scary, scary story! [laughing] Very well, a scary story it should be. Shh! (Anna) 'Once upon a time. .' ...long , long ago, in a faraway land there lived a huge and fearful dragon. He was as tall as the tallest tree in the forest. When he walked , it was an earthquake. When he breathed , a forest fire. All the people lived in terror of this monstrous beast who had Invaded their land from no one knew where. For he ate up their crops devoured their cattle 'and carried off all the young children to his lair.' What for? - Dessert. - Oh! - Didn't anyone try to stop him? - Of course, they did. The king sent north, south, east and west offering half his kingdom to anyone who'd come and slay this horrible beast. 'Many came to try and earn the reward .' But the dragon sizzled them. Then he frizzled them. Then he gobbled them up and he picked his teeth with their bones. Now it happened one fine day that two men a knight named Ludwig and his servant Hans set out in search of adventure. ♪ Why am I thirsting and flopping and bursting ♪ ♪ No relation passed to the ghastly adventure ahead ♪ ♪ What ea yest thou, Knave? ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're courageously outlandish ♪ ♪ Outrageously brave ♪ ♪ Why am I not daunted by fears ♪ ♪ That would haunt the most fearless? ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're outrageously brave ♪ ♪ With a courage courageously fearless ♪ ♪ Ha ha and now ♪ ♪ And now ♪ ♪ We go ♪ ♪ We go? ♪ ♪ To add a dragon ♪ ♪ To my ego ♪♪ [dragon growling] We're in luck, master.

Oh, he seems to have gone, master. Uh-huh. Well, let me at him. Charge! Oh! Are you sure he is gone? I looked all over the cave, master. Well, help me up. Flat feet! Look at the filthy beggar took one look at me and realized he's met his match. Huh! Rig ht now, he's probably a 100 leagues from here running for his life, huh. M-m-master! (Ludwig) Pity in a way. I should've enjoyed puncturing the ugly brute. Hans, kill him! Yes, master. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Don't anger it. Just kill him. [grunts] [intense music] Aah! Oh-ho! Whoa! 'Whoa!' Whoa-whoa-whoo! Whoa! Aaah! Hans, do something, you bumbling boobie. Watch out, master, here I come! Oh, oh, ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Whoa! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Master, do not leave me! I'm not leaving you, crybaby! I'm going for help. Oh, oh, oh. Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! Whoa! Ah! 'Oh ! Oh.' 'Whoa!' 'Eww! Whoa!' 'Oh ! Oh, whoa! Oh !' 'Oh !' 'Whoa! Oh ! Wow!' Oh, oh! Ah! Uh. Whoa! Oh! Help. - I said, help! - And now, dragon. I'm not as tasty as I look. Oh, no. Ah! Ah! M-master! Help! 'Master!' What is it? 'The dragon is dead .' Yes. Dead? Are you sure that he's not just pretending it? Oh, I-I-I-I stake my life on it. Well, we can't claim the reward without the creature's head, can we? I will be more than happy. No, no, give me the sword. If you want something done right, I say do it yourself. And en garde! [crashing] Whoa! Well, Hans.. You must be ti red. Rest here a while. Have a drink of water. No, thank you, master. You are very kind. But after you, sir. No, no, no, a good commander always looks after his men first. - Go ahead. Go ahead. - Oh, thank you, sir. Is it too blood-curdling , children? - 'Shall I stop?' - We know it's only make belief. (all) Please, don't stop. Don't stop. Please. Come on. Very well. So, because he feared that someone might discover it was the servant and not the master who had slain the dragon greedy Ludwig killed Hans and buried him under the apple tree. (Anna) While Ludwig went on to claim the reward and dwell in a fine castle good Hans lay beneath the ground. Spring passed and the earth's breast was warmed by summer's gentle touch. Autumn came painting the leaves with rainbow colors. The north wind brought winter into the land covering it with an icy blanket of purest white. And then it was spring again. Spring, the time for wakening. With the dragon gone everyone felt safe again and the countryside flourished. And so one fine day a shepherd with his flock passed by the apple tree. Suddenly, he saw something at its feet. With a bit of carving the shepherd thought I could make a fine flute to play on and soothe my flock. Straightaway he took out his knife and began to whittle holes. ♪ Oh, shepherd , listen to my tale ♪ ♪ I sleep beneath the tree ♪ May I ask, oh majesty why my presence was requested here? I have discovered a new musical instrument which I thought might amuse you. As ruler of half your kingdom I'd like to remind you that I simply loathe music. As ruler of the other half I suspect that you will change your mind. Eh, shepherd , would you play us a tune? Thank you so much Some other time, perhaps. ♪ Oh king pray listen to my tale ♪ ♪ I sleep beneath the tree ♪ ♪ My master Ludwig raised his sword ♪ ♪ And drove it into me ♪ ♪ I'll never walk the Earth again ♪ ♪ Or hear a bi rd or plant a seed ♪ ♪ Till the man who slew me says ♪ ♪ He's sorry for thy deed ♪♪ Well, Sir Ludwig? Your Majesty, it was an accident. You see, my sword slipped and poor Hans happened to be directly underneath. Because it was poor Hans who slew the dragon and not you, isn't that so? Yeah, yes, he was holding the sword when it entered the beast. Mercy, Your Majesty, I didn't know what I was doing. Mercy, I beg of you. The court will pass sentence. [indistinct chatter] You have been found guilty of the crimes of greed treachery and murder. - The penalty is-- - Wait! Don't do anything hasty! I'm sorry I did it. Truly sorry. Really am. Well, fancy that. My boy, you're just in time to hear a sentence passed on an evil person. Hans ! Don't let them kill me. If you'll overlook that one little incident. I was always a good master to you. It's true, Your Majesty. He was a good master. Any bit of old clothing he couldn't use he gave it to me. Then on a cold, bitter night he let me sleep next to his nice, warm horse. And any scrap of food his dogs wouldn't eat he'd let me have 'em. I implore you, Your Majesty spare his life. So be it. His life shall be spared. Thank you, Your Majesty. Well, help me up, crumpet face. Wait, I have not finished. You, Ludwig shall spend the rest of your life as servant to Hans. - Oh no. - 'Come here, my boy.' Hans here after to be known as Sir Hans, the dragon killer. Don't you worry, sir. I'll be just as good a master to you as you were to me. Thank you, Sir Hans. (kid #1 ) 'Tell us another one.' No, no. It's getting late. You must go home. No. No arguments now. Off you go. - Bye, Aunt Anna. - Goodbye, my boy. - Bye, Aunt Anna. - Goodbye. (Anna) 'Goodbye, dear.' 'Goodbye.' - Good bye, Aunt Anna. - Goodbye, my boy. Look after the girls now, won't you? - Good bye, Aunt Anna. - Goodbye, my dear. Hmm. What is it? - What's the matter? - Nothing. It will pass. Hmm. Hmm. Thank you. - I'll go and fetch a doctor. - No, no. Get me a hot cup of tea. And have some yourself. You're soaking wet. Thank you. I told you to go away. 'What were you doing outside?' Listening. You know? You shouldn't live here all alone. I'm not alone. Death has been my companion for sometime now. You have many good years left. I shall only regret leaving the children. But they'll remember me because of my stories. Like their parents before them. Those stories don't just belong to a few children. They belong to children all over the world. Now and forever after. I like you Wilhelm Grimm. Enough to tel I me some more stories? But there are so many of them. There's one about a little boy that was no bigger than my thumb. And there's a poor little girl whose face was always covered in cinders. And the other one whose skin was as white as snow. Would you like another cup of tea? No. No, just the stories. When she saw the blind prince, she wept with joy. Two of her tears fill into his eyes and suddenly he was able to see. [fog horn blaring at distance] The boat. Must be getting late. I really must go. How can I ever thank you? You have. You have. - Jacob I-- - The boat waited ten minutes. - I went to the church. - I lost all track of time. They told me you'd left over an hour ago. That's true, I did. Jacob, listen. I.. I found this wonderful old woman. The stories she tells, but.. If only you could have seen the happy faces of those children. Wha.. With their eyes wide and their souls warm. Look. These, these are pure gold. You can't realize how valuable they are. We have worked over six months on the Duke's family history. Unless it's delivered tomorrow we won't be paid. That's how valuable they are. Look. We'll get there somehow. Look. We can hire horses. Or-or a coach. We-we might even be able to catch them on the next land. - What's the matter? - Where is it? Where's the manuscript? I don't know, I.. I must have.. I slipped while crossing the river-- You fool. Six months.. .thrown away. Our whole career ruined , but these are safe. - Jacob forgive me. - Ask the Duke to forgive you. You form us an explanation ready. You're gonna explain to the Duke. But this time it's up to you. Because I won't be there. I'm not going back. What? But-but where will you go? Wherever I can find work by myself. I can't work any longer with you. You ruin everything you touch. I know you don't mean it. You-you're very angry and you have every right to be but, but we need you. - All of us. - I've got needs of my own. A wife, a home and time to do work that's important. I'll never have anything as long as I'm tied to you. Jacob. Jacob. I'm sorry, Wilhelm. But I'm much more sorry for your family with nothing to live on but dreams. It's not enough to lose the manuscript. Not enough to rob me of my gift to the king. Here's my portrait, just trample it. Wipe your boots on my face. You and your illustrious brother. You are very pleased to see me made ridiculous. No sir. And you mustn't blame my brother. - I'm entirely responsible. - Yeah. Hear that? He's a man of honor, our minstrel! Takes full responsibility for the crime. Brings to mind the old saying, "Honor among thieves." What shall I send to the king of Prussia instead? A pretty basket full of frogs and dogs and cats and dragons. Your grace. May I please be excused? Full responsibility you take and full punishment. To begin you get no money. I expect none, sir. Well, what do you expect? Answer! Your grace, I'm.. I can't think, I.. I could punish you in a way you couldn't even imagine. Fortunately for you, I'm a civilized man. I'm very glad to hear that. Listen to him. Detect a note of sarcasm? Unmistakably, sir. It wasn't meant to be. For six months, I've given you a house, rent free. You owe me that rent and you'll pay it. I'll try, your grace. You'll not try, you'll pay. I'll give you three days. Three days! If not, you will be evicted and sent to debtor's prison. Your grace. I can't. It's impossible. Not in three days. Please wait, your grace. How is he, doctor? Is he better? I can't truthfully say he's better. I can only say, he's no worse. No, not just words, doctor. I want to know the truth. In the morning , we shall all know. - He has been ill before? - Not this I I I. Never for such a long time. Come. Such a fool he is. So little strength. And he throws it away chasing day dreams. My father is not a fool. Oh, no, darling. What Mr. Stoneless means, is that it's foolish for your father to give so much of himself. To-to be so unselfish. That's what I mean. The whole world should be made of such foolishness. It's late. It's time for bed. - Greta, would you? - Oh, of course. - Goodnight. - Come along, children. Children don't understand. We scold most, the ones we love best. Momma. Will it help if we pray for papa? (Dorothea) 'Yes, my darling .' Mr. Grubber. Come in. I bring a communication from the Duke regarding your husband. That's very thoughtful of his grace. Mrs. Grimm the communication is an order to evict your husband and his family from this house. Evict? A man who may never see tomorrow? - You can't do that. - I must. Unless he's able to pay six months rent. He's not able to sit up to raise his head. The Duke has given me orders! May I give you an order, Mr. Grubber? Jacob! Oh! Tell his benevolent highness he will get his money. (Greta) Darling. Oh ! I'm so glad you're here. May I ask? When the Duke will receive the money? As soon as I sell my library. Sold. You'll get your money in the morning, Grubber. Or would you prefer to put me in debtor's prison? Eh, now please understand. I'm only obeying the Duke's order. We do understand. If there were no Duke, there would be no Grubber. Exactly. If there were no dogs.. ...there would be no fleas. This way. Jacob, don't go. I'm-I'm here-- Please, come back, Jacob. - I'm rig ht here, Wilhelm. - Come back. Forgive me. Forgive me. You've got to listen. - Can you hear me? - Forgive me. I won't go away. When you're well, we.. ...we'll start working again, just as before. L-I promise you. Just.. 'Just get well, Wilhelm.' (Wilhelm) 'lt's gone, the manuscript.' 'I'll find it.' 'I'll find it.' Jacob? Dorothea? 'Who is it?' Is this the residence of Wilhelm Grimm? I'm Wilhelm Grimm. Who are you? I'm a.. ...giant. Don't be absurd. There are no giants. Tsk, tsk, tsk. He's a lot sicker than we thought. We? Who's we? Friends of mine. Go away. I'm dying. Everybody knows it. You stop that. My friends are pulling in my trouser legs they want to see you. I don't want to see anybody. I'm tired. Very tired. Easy-easy, you over-grown ox. That's him? Please, go away. 'I want to sleep.' You be quiet now. He says he's dying. We must be respectful. Why, huh? Why? Is he respectful to us? Please leave me alone. You see? You see? No respect at all. He's mean and selfish. You're a nasty little man. Nasty little man? I am only nasty to them what's nasty to me. And nobody is nasty to me until I'm nasty to them first. 'And that includes everybody.' He thinks he's clever because he can spin gold out of straw. Can he really do that? Stop talking about me. When people talk about me, my beard itches and I can stand an itchy beard. He has quite a temper, hasn't he? Yes, and he really enjoys it. Why you little pipsqueak. I could crush you under my foot. 'You-you.. What is your name anyway?' I don't know. What is my name? How should I know? You see? How should I know? He doesn't care whether we live or die. All he's interested is in himself and anybody who's only interested in himself is not interested in anybody else too. I don't know what you're talking about. What he means, Mr. Grimm, is that our lives depend on you. If you die, we will never be born. We will never be born? [cries] Oh, now stop that! You promised if I brought you along, you wouldn't cry. They're very sentimental , Mr. Grimm. But I'm, I'm so tired. I've no more life left in me. But if you're gonna die, the least you can do is give us names. Please, Mr. Grimm, would you? Without names, we're nobodies. (all) We're nothing. Please, give us names. [frog croaks] Please. Would that be asking too much, Mr. Grimm? Well, since you're.. ...no bigger than my thumb.. ...I'll call you Tom Thumb. Tom Thumb? Tom Thumb! Hurray! I got a name! Tom Thumb. Your...face is dirty. It's from cinders. Then you should be called.. . Cinder-ella. (all) Cinderella! Oh, I like that very much, Mr. Grimm. Thank you. Cinderella. And I? You are.. .white as snow. You are Snow White. Oh, Thank you, Mr. Grimm. Thank you, Mr. Grimm. - Oh, no. What? - Hansel. Hansel. (Wilhelm) 'Gretel .' Gretel. Mr. Grimm. This is easy. You're Little Red Riding Hood. Thank you, Mr. Grimm. But what about me? You forgot about me. Don't I get a name? Rumpel-stilts-kin. My! Well, that's ridiculous. When do you ever heard such a name? Rumpeldid. Uh, uh, Rumel? What does it mean anyway? I.. I can't see you. All things die differently, Mr. Grimm. We die like dreams, fade into forgetfulness. No. Don't. You mustn't. We haven't much more ti me. When you reach your last heartbeat we reach ours. But it-it isn't fair. Why must this be on my conscience? Say goodbye. (all) Goodbye, Mr. Grimm. Goodbye, and thank you, Mr. Grimm. Come back. Didn't you forget something? Bye. Tell them to come back. Tell them. Only you can call them back. Only you. Wait. Only you. - Don't leave me. - 'Only you.' Where are you? 'Only you.' Where've you gone? [dramatic music] Wilhelm! Thea! Don't go in. I'll go. Jacob, I've got to. Please let. It's gone. The fever's gone. What's this? "Once upon a. ." "One upon a time, there was a tiny little boy. His name was Tom Thumb." Of course, it's difficult, but by his own admission the Duke is a civilized man And if we go on paying our rent he will graciously permit us to go on living in our house. Of course he's raised the rent, but-- Well, that has a strange sound to it as though you plan to go on living there too. When my brother was ill I made him a promise that I would stay and work with him. You also made a promise to me. They are very different. One is, you might call it a duty but it's much more. The other much less? No, darling. But I-I have only so much money and the family has to be taken care of. But it's his family, Jacob, not yours. He's my brother. [sighs] Does that give him a claim on your whole life? I know he needs you, but so do I. Oh, it's humiliating to beg. But I don't care. With you I have no pride. If only you'd wait a while. How long is a while? A month. A year? I don't know. Forever? Greta, I love you. You love me and I love you and there's nothing more to say, is there? Well, there's nothing to be gained by tormenting each other. I'm going home. Wait, I.. I'll take you. Not my aunt's home. My home...in Berlin. Goodbye, Jacob. [instrumental music] Jacob, where have you been? - Have you had supper? - I wasn't hungry. I felt like walking. This is for you. Your flower vendor drives a hard bargain. 'Still it's quite a good story.' 'It's about a. .' About a tailor, who kills seven with one blow. Seven flies that is. 'Town's people misunderstand' 'and they are amazed.' So am I. I thought that fairy tales were just a waste of time. Yes. It's true. I did feel that way. How do you feel about Greta Heinrich? Ms. Heinrich and I have reached an understanding. I know. She came to say goodbye. She was crying. Goodbyes are sentimental occasions for women. In fact, sentiment often blinds them to practical matters. Aha? Such as? I need Wilhelm to complete my work. He needs my help to complete his stories. We'll start first thing in the morning. Goodnight. What are you doing here? We want a story. - Papa, can we? - Not tonight. Papa's too ti red. - Oh, just one. - Just a little. - Just a teeny-weeny one. - No, you heard your mother. - Come along . - We'll never get.. - Come along I say. - Scary story. Come along. And no complaining. And don't annoy your father, he's been much too sick. - But he's better now. - Shh, into bed I say. I will tell you a story. [chuckles] You don't know any stories. You're wrong, I just heard one today from the flower vendor. - Did you pay her? - What did it cost you? What did it cost me? Enough. (Dorothea) 'Wilhelm.' Wilhelm! - Wilhelm. Oh, dear. - What is it? - What's the matter? - The Duke is here. He's downstairs. Well, what's the trouble? We-we pay the rent. Maybe he's raising it again. More likely throwing us out. Why that miserable-- Don't keep him waiting . You know what a temper he's got. Jacob, my illustrious scholar, my gifted man of letters. I came here the moment I heard. Heard what? How are you? I'm-I'm very much better. Thank you. I'm happy to present my distinguished protege Jacob Grimm, uh and his brother. Mr. Dantino from Berlin. The Dantino? I'm very honored to meet you, sir. How do you do, sir? Have you met our friend Stoneless? We have been in communication. I know all about it. - All about what? - Silence. Silence. I've been commissioned by His Majesty Wilhelm lll, King of Prussia.. Man of Honor, courage, wisdom the man I'm humbly grateful to. [clears throat] Continue. To inform you, gentlemen that you have elected to membership in the Berlin Royal Academy. - Did you hear that? - Royal Academy. Surprised, huh? But not I. I want you to know I was the first to recognize the talent. I know all about it. - I told him. - Oh. The induction ceremony will take place in Berlin. I present you now with your certificate of membership. Excuse me. "In recognition of the literary and scholarly excellence "of the German grammar, Serbian grammar "legal antiquities, Grimms law of consonants Latin poetry. ." Is something wrong? No, it's.. It's just that there's no mention of the fairy tales. Fairy tales? Never mind. It's not important. Fairy tales? Ridiculous. Frogs and dogs and hags and dragons. Frogs and dogs and hags and dragons. - There's the sign. - What does it say? Berlin. We're getting close to Berlin. - We're almost there. - Quiet, children. Now be quiet, let Uncle Jacob think what he's going to say. Uncle Jacob knows what he's going to say. Members of the academy I'm deeply grateful for this honor which I regret to say is, is an outrage. That's not very polite. Nor sensible. It's your day, stop resenting it. Look, whatever work we performed we performed equally. Whatever honors are received, we should share equally. You know, if you're not careful, you'll also share in my reputation such as loony, mad-- No, you're nothing of the sort. Neither is Jacob I hope. We are being honored for your work, not mine. Oh, you were rig ht about the fairy tales they were a waste of ti me. Oh, quick reading . Quickly forgotten. Never mind that. It is an outrage. In my speech, I'm going to tell them that-- Jacob, just tell them.. Just tell them that I'm your brother. The Berlin Royal Academy welcomes you. The Brothers Grimm in our midst. We want a story. We want a story. We want a story. We want a story. Just tel I them I'm your brother. We want a story. We want a story. Once upon a time.. ...there were two brothers.
