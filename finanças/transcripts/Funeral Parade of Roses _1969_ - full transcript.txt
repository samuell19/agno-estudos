I AM A WOUND AND A BLADE, A VICTIM AND AN EXECUTIONER. A MATSUMOTO PRODUCTION NIHON ART THEATRE GUILD FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES Look. It's a beautiful day. It's too bright. How about this? Yes. I don't like the sun. You're like an owl. How rude. Toss me that. What do you think of these muscles? Can you lift that chair up with one arm? Of course I can. See? Hey, can you do my back? What do you think? You're so beautiful, Eddie. Do I look good with my hair up? You look good either way. I don't want to part with you. Don't quit, Eddie. But I have to. Just a little longer. I'll make Leda quit no matter what. Then, you'll be... the Madame of the Genet. EXECUTIVE PRODUCER MITSURU KUDO She'll get revenge on me for stealing you. Damn Leda. DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY TATSUO SUZUKI ART DIRECTOR SETSU ASAKURA MUSIC JOJI YUASA EDITOR HISAE IWASA - Want one? - No. - Wasn't that the Madame? - It can't be. - That was her. - Don't look back! Do you think she followed us? Nonsense. But it was her. PETER OSAMU OGASAWARA and YOSHIO TSUCHIYA What do you think she'll do? She won't do anything. I'm scared. Damn it, Leda. - If it's her, then... - Don't say it! WRITER & DIRECTOR TOSHIO MATSUMOTO Please show me your hand. Everyone! Please show me your hand. Show me your hand. What are you going to give me? Now, don't move your hand. - Done. - What the heck is this? No matter how hard I look, you look like a real woman. How long have you been in this world? - About four years. - I see. Why did you become a gay boy? Because I wanted to be a girl. I just like it. - You like girls? - No, I like being a girl. What kind of satisfaction do you get from it? I'm really enjoying myself right now. Have you ever thought of going back to being a guy? No, I haven't. So you'd rather be a real woman? No, I don't want to go that far either. How long have you been a gay boy? Since December of last year. Why did you became a gay boy? Because I like it. What do you like about it? Being gay. - Being gay? - Yes. You mean, you like men? No. - Then, what do you...? - Well... I don't know. But I like being gay. - You mean, being a gay gay? - Yes. How did you come to like it? I was born that way. - Born that way. - Yes. Hello! It's been a while! Please come in. It's an interesting place, isn't it? I couldn't get it up. You got too scared, didn't you? Here. Do you know what this is? What is this? - You know! It just looks like one! - Oh, no! Don't embarrass me like that! See? I'll turn it on. There! Oh, no! Stop it! Gay bars have changed. Yes, especially in this area. That's so true. You were playing the shamisen when you were in Akasaka. It was such a long time ago! This is the Madame back then. - So beautiful! - Really! You're so beautiful! - A call for you, Madame. - Yes. Excuse me for a moment. Hello? Oh, my, Mr. Iida! Where are you? What? The Jardin? Why don't you stop by? Even for a little bit. We'll be waiting for you. Okay. Bye, then. MIRROR, MIRROR, ON THE WALL, WHO IS THE FAIREST ONE OF ALL? Do you know what time is? I'm sorry. You're awfully early. Who does she think she is? By the way, did you bring that stuff? - Hello, Tony! - Come on, Eddie! Where are we going, Tony? Hey, what's that? Hey, where are you going? Watch out! Oh, no! The riot police have moved in... ...complete chaos... Hold it right there! ...excessive force was used. Damn. No good. All right. Cut! Okay. I'll do it. Don't over do it. Idiot! Just leave it to me! All right. Move out of my way! Hey, I was doing just fine. Hey, do it slowly. - What were you doing? - Oh, shut up. How about this? A little more. How about this? No good. How about now? That's terrible! Damn it! - Hey, now it's good! - Yeah, that's it! How's my technique? What are you talking about? - Hey, that hurts! - Don't move! Looks good. That's it. Hold it there. All right, cut! That'll do! - 20 more feet to go! - Hey, let's have a smoke. Just leave it as is. Man, I want to smoke a joint so badly. Eddie hasn't shown up yet. Do you want to roast the banana peels? That won't work. - I've got two pills. - Hey, give it to me! That won't help. We can always use the eye drops. Are you drinking it? This is so creepy. They look cool, right? FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES She is so shameless. She makes me so mad. Don't take it too seriously. Kids these days think totally differently. You're encouraging them by saying things like that. But, if you keep complaining, nobody is going to work with you. But she has no manners, all she's got is her sexuality. Times have changed. But gay boys have their own pride. Don't you think so? If you're a pro, then behave like one. Ouch! What's wrong? I cut my leg! It's bleeding now. See? Look. Ouch... Jeez. It's almost like a mosquito bite. Let me see. All better now. You don't need to fuss over it. I'm sorry. I was just so nervous. About what? I thought you would leave me. Don't be silly. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Hey, who do you like more? Eddie or me? You, of course. WAIT BEFORE YOU GET MARRIED Hey, do you want to have some fun, lady? Go out with me. HELL Is something wrong? No, it's nothing. Are you alone? Yes, but I'm fine now. Would you like to have tea with me? Come on. Just for a little bit. Each man has his own mask... Some will wear the same mask for their entire life. Some will wear several masks based on their needs. Some masks resemble their facial features. But some masks are totally different. Some masks are so ugly and obvious. But some masks are well made, and it's hard to tell if it's a mask or not. People always wear masks and see masks when they look at others. Even if they remove their masks... you can't be sure if you're seeing the real face underneath. There is a second mask underneath the first mask. And a third mask is hidden underneath the second mask. Therefore, the other person may think of your mask as yourself. And you also think of their masks as their own faces. The subject of love and hatred, therefore, may be the masks. Under those masks, people try to escape their loneliness. And they will create even more sophisticated masks. Oh, come on! That hurts. Come on, Eddie! Get up! Get up! - Oh, stop. - Hey, taxi! Taxi! Where are we going? Come on! It tickles. Stop it, Tony! Hey, Guevara. Yeah? What do you want me to do with these? Can you just put them together for now? Okay. WHAT A SUBTLE AND MYSTERIOUS SCHEME Cut! Oh, wait! Was it okay? Yeah, okay! All right. Can you hand her that shirt? Can you bring that light in? Are we done with the microphone? We are going to interview Rabbit next! An interview? We need to do it in 20 minutes. We can't interfere with their business. Okay, now can you move over there? What do you think of that love scene? Well... What do you think of a man making love to another man, as a gay boy? Do you feel any guilt? Well, I don't think it matters if it's between a man and another man. If you love someone, their gender doesn't matter. Are gay boys, not necessarily... attracted to girls? Well, that depends, I think. It's not my place to comment on that. So are you more interested in men over women? Me? As a gay boy in general. In general, that's true because they're all doing it as a girl, so... How about you, Rabbit? Me? I'll leave it to your imagination. Please don't smoke that cigarette in bed If you love me, then put it out Close your eyes and have a nice dream I let out a sigh with the smell of sweet Chanel I'm waiting for you again tonight Please don't smoke that cigarette in bed Have you heard of NHSMC? Nippon Homosexual Men's Club. - Where is it at? - Just outside of the Minami-cho. They have a party every week. The members will escort their favorite pretty boys. I read about it in a tabloid. No, that's not it. That one is in Akasaka. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You're talking about the secret club in one of the apartments. I hear there are a lot of those lately. That's because there are many impostors, too. What do you mean by "impostors?" They're not real homos. I see. Just so they can make money. Don't look at me like that! We're the real ones! Watch out. Cops are here. What? Cops? Hey, Eddie! Do you know this man? - Who is it? - His name is Yagawa. He's gone missing. I don't think I've seen him before. It's been 12 years today. You probably don't remember it. Forget about Dad! You have me! This is so tasty! Don't you think so? Yeah, it's so tasty. What are you doing? Just walk straight! Hey, don't peek! Look! It's so pretty! No, it won't look good on you. This is nice. Look! I'm in a fashion show! - Look! This is so beautiful! - It's nice. - It must be expensive. - Someone will buy it for me. - You found someone? - That's right. It's old news. I didn't know that at all! - That looks so tasty! - I'm hungry. - Nice. - That's not my thing. I want to eat something. Excuse me. - Me, too. - Hey, me, too! I feel better now. EIRIN [Film Classification & Rating Committee] What good is she? She's as bad as a loafer! - Oh, come on. - What do you mean by that? Hey, watch out. - I got it. Now just go to bed. - No! You must promise me you'll fire Eddie, or I won't move! You're impossible. Listen, Leda. Eddie is the Number One girl at the Genet. Don't forget that customers come to see her. Why don't you just admit it? You love her. Idiot! You always complain. You're mean! Are you really a man! "Are you really a man?" Isn't that my line? Let me tell you this right now, I'd rather fire you than her! Fine. I get it. Go ahead and fire me. If that's the case, I'll reveal your secret! THAT MEANS YOU DON'T LOVE HUMAN BEINGS Please don't leave me! Shut up! YES, I HATE THEM. Damn it, Leda. If it's her, then... Don't say it! Stop. Stop the car. What's wrong? I don't feel good. Let me out. Eddie. Don't be nervous. I'll take you home. I need some fresh air. Are you all right? I'll call you later. It's so creepy. READY What do you think? I don't get it. My ears are ringing. I've never seen anything like it. - Hey, can you unplug this? - Okay! They call it "underground," don't they? Yeah. Eddie, you look like a pigeon shot by a gun! That's true. "All definitions of cinema have been erased." "All the doors are now open." Menas Jokas. Jonas Mekas. Oh, that's right. But don't you feel something? Physically? Yes. I feel like I'm high. Oh really? I prefer the real stuff. I agree! - It's about time to... - No! - Hey, Chao! - Nice! Oh, no, don't touch it! - Come on! - Don't push! Can I have two? Here. Two. No credit for these. Stingy! Give it, give it, give it! How about you, Piro? I'll have one. How much marijuana have you smoked before? A lot. I smoked heavily. How does it feel when you smoke? It feels like I'm floating from the chair... Like a chair floating on top of a rock. Do you know what I mean? A chair floating on top of a rock. But it doesn't feel so hard. It just feels like you're floating on top of a bed. I want to feel more of that. That's what I'm looking for. Have you ever smoked marijuana? No. Have you tried drugs? All the time. What kind of drugs? Minahai, usually. Maruso, when I'm desperate. And Dondon. How do you feel when you take it? You just feel so numb and mentally slow. That's all. How should I put it...? It's like... you can't see yourself. Is it like you're feeling ecstasy? No, there's not even that. There's nothing. And if you take it too much, you don't even remember that. You don't even feel time. You don't feel yourself at all. It was funny to hear later that I was moving around a lot. So, I was doing a lot of things. What are you seeking from these experiences? I'm not seeking anything. I haven't even thought of it. How did you get started? It's the same as alcohol, but it's easier to take. And it doesn't take any time at all. There! Go! Go! Go! All right! Get him! Hey, it tickles! - Take his pants off! - Help! Touch him! Touch him! Okay, next! Come on, girl! That was quick. Take it off! Take it off! The top or the bottom? Take her bra off! Come on, take it off! You are so glamorous! Come on! Good luck, Guevara! You can do it! He's gonna fall. All right! He made it! Take this! You, maggots! - Take it off! - I'll do it myself! - Come on, take it off! - Shut up! Don't touch me! Damn, what a dirty shirt! - Eddie is next! - Me? - No way! - Good luck! All right. Go! You can do it, Eddie! - She's done! - Good night! Not yet! That one first! That's cheating. All right! We're done with the first chapter! Let's go on the next journey, Sherlock Holmes! ROSES OH, THE EMPIRE OF ROSES Hello. Come in! Good morning! You're going to the salon, right? - Give me a minute. - Sure. I'll put on my makeup quick. Hey, this looks tasty. Can I have one? Of course. It looks so tasty. Stop it. I know what you're thinking. No, you're thinking of something else. Our imaginations are pretty limited. Did you do something bad last night? Actually, it'll make you laugh. I was eating ramen at Kamehachi over there on the way home. Then a boy who sat next to me came on to me. He asked me to go to a hotel. I was drunk, too, so I tagged along with him because he was nice. Then guess what happened. I think you call it masochism. He asked me to tie up his hands and step on his back. It was something. Then he screamed like a sea lion. Let's relax and do some exercises! And he really believed that I was a girl, right up until the end! I hear people like that are very troubled. - Come on. - Stop it, you pervert! - See you tomorrow! - Eddie, just a minute. - We'll be at Goro's. - I'll catch up. Do you know why I stopped you? Do you think I know nothing? SCHEMER SKUNK THIEF IDIOT ASS FAG WHORE IMPOTENT SHIT C__T Damn you! Get out of here, you bastard! Damn you! Underneath the mask. The true face always feels the loneliness. People want to escape from that loneliness. Hey, it's you, Eddie. Hey, Eddie. Come on. Ouch! I warned you, didn't I? That's enough. Stop crying. This is the last one. Do you think they will heal by my birthday? Of course. They're just scratches. Will you celebrate my birthday? Of course. Let's go to the Imperial Hotel and have a big party with everyone! We don't need to go out. Let's just stay the two of us. I'll decorate my room with a lot of flowers. Of course, they'll all be roses. And we'll light candles. It'll be so romantic. Ow! This is scary. All the outlines are fuzzy. Outlines are always changing. You try to reach something, but it's not there anymore. It's not just you. It's there, but you can't see it? Or does it disappear? What if it wasn't there from the beginning? From the beginning? That's right. Like a mirage. Then, what should I believe? I don't know. It's strange. What is? I feel like I've experienced the same thing before. But it's not possible. It's strange. Something's wrong with me today. Haven't you felt like that before? Be careful! Don't run! Listen to your father! FATHER RETURNS LET THE DAY I WAS BORN PERISH AND DISAPPEAR... ...since it may have a great impact on the youth. A special task force was formed within the Metropolitan Police Department today. But considering the severity of the narcotics epidemic, it might have been rather too late. That's it for today's news. Good night. Please donate to save lives! - Was that the Madame? - It can't be. - That was her. - Don't look back! Do you think she followed us? Nonsense. What are you doing?! There's something wrong with me today. You're probably just tired. I feel like I've been abandoned by life for a long, long time. One can waste the better part of a lifetime in walking... ...without actually being a walking man. And on the other hand, one may have walked very little... ...may have never cared for walking, never been good at walking... ...and yet be unquestionably a walking man. Le Clézio, a writer, said that. - Come on. - Stop it, you pervert! Stop. No! No, no, no, no... No! Please, stop it. Shit! It hurts! Don't! Don't do it! Don't! Don't do it! Don't! Don't! Please, don't. Don't! Don't do it! Please! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! THE ROAD TO SANCTITY IS NARROW Cut! Peter, what do you think of this main character, “Eddie?" She's very similar to me. She lost her father when she was young, just like me. Not just her lifestyle... her personality is also similar. Her personality is similar to yours? Do you sympathize with her? Yes, especially her lifestyle. Not the incest part. I don't sympathize with that. But I understand her character. What made you decide to take this role? I've never done a film before, so I was very interested. Also, because I'm coming from a similar environment. And it also portrays gay boys beautifully. What do you think of the love scenes? I just do what the director tells me to do. We must fight the system! The educational system is corrupt! You know her, right? By face, yes. She doesn't know me, though. That's why it's better. What are the conditions? Her face. Nothing else. There. Who's there? Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I was being chased by the police. You're bleeding. Come this way. Thank you so much. - You better see a doctor. - I know. - Didn't it hurt? - No. I was outside of myself. It's so dangerous. You're lucky it wasn't much worse. You really saved me. But why did you join the riot? To defeat the state power. But I don't think violence is the answer. It's not a matter of accepting violence. But rather it's a matter of understanding what the violence you are taking part in is progressing towards. And knowing whether your actions are heading towards the elimination of violence, or towards the continuation of violence. And, in the end, to make that decision, instead of using morals to judge crimes, which people mistakenly call “pure morals," you should decide by considering the logic of the situation, the dynamics of the structure, and our history itself. Oh, no, I'm late. I have to go. I'm so sorry for causing you any trouble. Don't worry about it. Do you know what time it is? I'm sorry. You're awfully early. Who does she think she is? Hello. I'm so sorry for keeping you waiting. No, no, same here. I've just finished it. Huh? I got my appetite back, thanks to you! Bye. Hey, you looked down on us! What are you talking about? You want to get your ass kicked, you fags! - What did you call us? - "Fags," she said. Oh, my! What's wrong with calling fags "fags," you fags! You're just some cheap women! "Some cheap women?!" Isn't that right? Men won't even give you a look! That's a stupid thing to say! If you didn't know... Oh! ...we'll show it to you! How about that! Go get them! Welcome home! How was your day? Awful. You didn't get hurt, did you? No. What about Eddie? I mean, we can't afford to lose her right now. Shut up! Stop with your cheap act! You embarrassed me so badly. What did you tell Osumi? Huh? She told me everything. Did you really think I wouldn't find out, you idiot? Please listen to me! Shut up! I see. You want to tell me that's how much you love me, huh? Or what? You don't care about me, but you care about being the Madame at the Genet? How can you say that? Don't you start crying. No crying for me. I don't think so. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? Don't make me laugh. You got old. Your era is over. Do you really think you'll get away with this? That's not right. You see, I got rid of all the evidence already. Take your time and let it sink in. THE SUN, THE SEVERED HEAD Good evening. Are you by yourself? - No, they're coming. - Welcome! ...then, which do you like? Akihiro Maruyama or Carousel Maki? Carousel, I guess. You? - I would go with Akihiro Maruyama. - Why? Because Marousel Maki had plastic surgery... Oops, I'm so sorry! So, how's the shoot going? Just a little bit left to shoot. It must be hard for you since it's your first movie. Do you think it'll be a hit? I don't know, but it's unusual, you know. APPLAUSE REQUESTED! Leda isn't here yet? That's strange. Juju went to get her a while ago. She's late. You might not be able to see her again, Tony. Because of the Vietnam War. - Eddie, a phone call from Juju! - Yes. Hello, it's me. What?! She loved roses. Yes . And they had to be artificial ones. Thank you so much. No, no. My sincere condolences to you all. Please come this way. The ground around here is sinking. Wow. Look at that! It sunk that much! I hope the whole country sinks to the bottom of the ocean someday. THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO END Guevara... What are you thinking about? About the exit. The exit? From the open ceiling, roses are falling one after another. Spring. Oh, unhappy spring. Déodat de Séverac. Here we go. I'm so sorry. Go ahead, put them over there. Eddie, I mean, Madame. It sounds funny. - Don't be silly! - Where would you like this? Let me see... - How about that corner? - Okay. Excuse me. This is dirty, can you throw it away? Yes . - Goodbye. - I wish you success. Stop by sometime. - Madame? Can I just leave this here? - Yes, that's fine. I would like to know your biggest dream. What would you like to do? I would like to save up some money and have my own store. A gay bar? Yes, I think so. So are you going to live as a gay boy for the rest of your life? I guess. Do you ever think about marriage? Yes, I do, but I don't plan to. I can't, either, since I can't go back to being a boy. Can you tell us what you would like to do or be in the future? I don't want to be anything. I don't want to be anything. - You don't want to be anything? - No. Is there anything you want to do? I'm doing this right now, so... So you're happy being a gay boy right now? Right now, yes. What would you like to do from now on? I don't have a plan. - You have no plan? - No. Are you happy being a gay boy? Not so happy. Not so happy? Then, why did you become a gay boy? No particular reason. - No reason? - Yes. ROSES Hello! FATHER RETURNS The bath was so good. Why don't you get in, too? Yeah. What's the matter? It was frightening, wasn't it? What an awful thing! The cursed destiny of man! It was such a unique film with cruelty and laughter. Let's look forward to the next film! Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. THE SPIRIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL REACHES ITS OWN ABSOLUTE THROUGH INCESSANT NEGATION
