All characters appearing in this film are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, alive or dead.. ..is purely coincidental. Tell me, who is driving our country? - The country? It is not a vehicle for someone to drive it. And where will they drive it to? Outside the earth? Our country will remain where it was.. ..and it will remain there forever. I agree. You are right. That's why you are able to fool everyone.. ..since so many years. The country means system which everyone curses. You and me. And this system has made us enemies of each other. Cheers. You are referring to the powerful foxes. That's where you lost it. The one who are holding high positions.. ..are not running the country. What we can see is all an act. Democracy. The real thing goes on behind the scenes. Excuse me. - What? Do you have a light? - Light. Here is a lighter. - I also want a cigarette. All my smokes are over. Who is calling me so late at night? Okay. You can leave now. - Yes. Go. - Yes, tell me. So where we? Behind the scenes. - Yes. Gandhi said that Pandit Nehru.. ..wanted to be the Prime Minister. The country agreed. And Pandit Nehru became the Prime Minister the next day. Now tell me what political power supported Pandit. Tell me. Gandhi was the Mahatma. Mahatma has their own powers. They are driving this nation. Mahatma Gandhi? Look at this. Isn't he? Boy, get a packet of cigarettes. You are drinking so slowly. Have a neat. Run. Policemen feed you for free on only two instances. One when he is afraid of losing his job. And second when he is expecting a medal from the government. What are you going to get that today.. ..you are treating me to free wisdom and alcohol? Today is good Friday. Our festival. So I thought I would sit with you. Enjoy a little. Pray to Jesus Christ. Have Pehelwan hanged. So you have changed colors. As soon as the power equations changed, you changed colour like a chameleon. You didn't recognize the government Pehelwan. How would you recognize me? Yes, I have been trapped today because.. ..I didn't understand you. Look Jacob, no police station in this country.. ..has got my photo nor do I have any case against me. Once Bhanumati returns to power I will get clean chit. But what will happen to you? You neither have a Mahatma nor a Gandhi. You will go directly inside. Don't scare me. You have become too serious. I have drank so much alcohol.. ..that I might pee in my pants. Don't scare me. Let's go and pee. You have taken it seriously. I am just kidding. Come. Come on. What are you doing? Come. Come. How far are we going? Do you want to pee in front of the tiger? Why are you glaring at me like this? You can pee now. I know your men are around somewhere. I won't run away. - You are very smart. You haven't understood yet. I have got you here to kill you in an encounter. I told you that only Mahatma and Gandhi.. ..running the nation. Mahatma is the one who have no evidence of their crimes. Who ordered me to be killed, Jacob? The same Mahatma to whose crime you bear witness. You have to die so that he can have a clean chit, Pehelwan. Don't speak in riddles. Tell me clearly. Tell me, who is behind this? Bhanumati. You are going to die on a good today. Today is the day Jesus Christ had given his blood.. ..to pay for our sins. God might forgive you today. You have honored me a lot by bringing the.. ..entire army to kill this unarmed Pehelwan. Give me one more favor. Turn around. I need to pee hard. Go ahead. Jacob. - Yes. How can your God forgive anyone today? His son was crucified today? If you call this Friday good Friday then... You are about to die. You can ask Him yourself. Tell me which hell would you prefer? Of Hindus, Christians, Muslims or the Jews. (Gun Firing) They is here. - Catch him. (Crowd Chattering) (Water Waves Sound) Sir, he is done for. - Pehelwan is no more. Shall we? Hey. Who is it? Greetings Baba. We have arranged for your bathing in Ghat No. 2. Take a left turn from ahead. This way, go ahead. You monkey. Are you in a hurry to meet God? You misunderstand. I am Damroo. Damroo. Damroo. Sir. What happened? Sir. Sir. (Door Opens) What happened, friend? Are you okay? Damroo. Where is Damroo? - Who is Damroo, friend? Mouney Baba found you injured. He brought you here. Have some offerings. Mouney Baba? Very powerful Baba. Mouney Baba. He has surrendered his voice to God. He is always silent. Take his blessings and let's leave. Greetings, Baba. Greetings, Baba. Sir, I have been in this profession for the last 1.5 years. And now I know that no business is better than religion. And such respect. Great leaders, kings, CM, PM, everyone touches your feet. Bhanumati's cronies are looking for me everywhere. And you are spreading knowledge here. Just tell me, where should we run away from here? Shall I cross the border to Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka? You don't need to go anywhere now. You have reached your destination. In the temple of religion. Everything can change here. You can change too. Even the police, CID, etc. can't find anyone here? Nothing. Bhanumati is insignificant in front of all this. - (Birds Chirping) Just take of this garb and surrender to River Ganga. We will start a new game at an international level. You want me to turn to an ascetic like you. Sir, not an ascetic. I said Baba. I can't do anything since my speech is impaired. Otherwise I would have gone places. You haven't done anything but abuse and get abused. And now you want to tell people about the scriptures. No one has time to listen to scriptures. Baba means who takes money.. ..and shows the shortcut to heaven. And enough money to even give loans to Swiss banks. Stay like kings. Just watch. Listen to me. Say goodbye to the past and turn over a new leaf. (Birds Chirping) Sir is giving up his body. Keep it. I am renouncing everything. Are you going to give me everything? Don't stop. Just give everything away. Even your chain. (Birds Chirping) Very good. Hail Mahadev. Hail Babaji. (Temple Bell) (Gun Firing) (Conch Shell Blowing) Sir, it seems like a small place. But it is gold. There is a lot of property. It's a city of black marketers! Kabirganj. What they say? Cottage industries. Handicrafts. Everything is exported. So they earn in dollars. Goodness. Do you remember the Dhuliya? He has his own bank here. We need to join hands with him. What is this? You said that there is no shop for religion here? Sir, I was about to tell you about it. It's nothing. Look at the name below. Bholanath Tripathi, Former MLC. He is just a former politician. Nothing else. He used to do perform protests in villages here. Now he doesn't bother about money etc. People respect him somewhat. We will take over his shop and start our business. Sir, I know. We have come here in a public bus without a ticket. And we will leave from here in an airplane. Sir, I want to ask you something I was thinking about. What is your real name? So aren't you going to give yourself a name? Everyone has one. Do you want a name or not? My name is Damroo. A dream of a glorious India. A dream of a beautiful India. It is the rule of nature that as you sow so shall you reap. The India of the future. So teach them good things today so that our future.. ..and the future of the country is secured. Right, Mr. Agarwal? What happened? I am very troubled, Pandit. - What happened? It seems someone has cast an evil eye on my health. What did the doctor say? First I tested positive for high sugar. And the BP and now because of cholesterol.. ..I have been asked to do a bypass surgery. My wife is saying that surely someone.. ..has done hoodoo on my health. That mean some has cast an evil eye. - Yes. You are a great man. Please cure me of this. Manku, forget the tea. Go inside and get the ashes from the incense that is burning. And rub it on his pajamas. (Laughing) What are you saying? - What else should I say? Mr. Agarwal I have told you several times to perform yoga. Exercise a little. You will eat fried fish, chicken etc. How would that do? Your wife says that some has cast an evil eye. Manku, take off the pajamas.. ..maybe you will get rid of the evil eye. Go and do yoga, Mr. Agarwal. I am not joking. What will you do with the body? Go and do some Yoga there. Pandit, tell us what should I do with the doors and windows... What happened? Have they got termites? - No. Nothing is safe in the house.. ..where we were able find everything. Theft is increasing. Pandit, I took a loan from the bank to open a factory. I lost everything overnight. - The police.... The police does nothing, Pandit. They have now 14 police stations instead of 4. But what's the use? There is an old saying. A hut of smart men in the neighborhood of fools. How can we act wise in this world? One minute. One minute. One minute. What happened? - I need your blessings. I have come from far away. I had come to take your blessing. I am leaving now. It's okay. Where are you from? Nowhere? I had travelled a 1000 miles on foot. - Okay. Tell me. - Yes. These innocent people. - Yes. They come here with their problems. - Of course. And you are making fun of them. I am not making fun of them. You are talking indecently with them. I had come from far away to be taught by you. But you have opened my eyes. Look, sir. I name is Bhola Pandit. Do you understand? I am not Baba Ramdev for you to come from far away. So sorry. - No, you can't be like Ramdev. You can't even be his assistant. That is too much, bro. - Listen. Don't shout. Calm down. He has got the right to speak. I don't want to say anything. You can go your way. I have found the real one in my search of the fake. If I had not come here than I wouldn't even met Global Baba. Who? Global Baba. Globe. The earth. Globe. - And it's Global. Global Baba. - Okay, Global Baba. Who is he? - That was the name he gave me. Last night at Kabirganj. And I saw that my neck was hurt. What happened? The thieves of Kabirganj stole it. - What? This on and then some came and said that.. ..Global Baba has come here. He is taking rest there. In Kabirganj. - Yes, in Kabirganj. A 6 feet man was lying like this. A cobra was at his head. Cobra? - Yes. King cobra. - King cobra? I became nervous. I was not even able to speak. Baba suddenly opened his eyes and asked what happened? I said I have been robbed. He concentrated and told me the address right away. What is his name? - Global Baba. Yes, Global Baba. - In Kabirganj. Yes, in Kabirganj. He is sitting there. 10 minutes away from here. He is an atom bomb. You are just a cracker. Forgive me. I am leaving. Oh no. - Sorry. Get away. Brother. Brother, stop. Don't you dare follow me. The true finds the truth. And the false finds falsehoods. You deserve him. Bye. - Brother listen. Please take us to Global baba. Don't bother me. Don't bother me. That man there. He is your savior. He will help you. Don't follow me, rascals. Go away. Brother, listen to me. Go away. Don't follow me. Where are you going? - Listen to me. Where is Baba? Baba. - That is not him. Go away. Go. Because of you I lost such a great person. Brother! Come here. Here. Is that him? - Yes, he is Global baba. He is Global Baba. - But this tiger. When I met him this tiger was not with him. How did a tiger came in to Kabirganj? I don't know. He is playing with the tiger like a pet dog. Move. Move. Baba. - Do you want us to die? Why are you disturbing him? If he became angry and let the tiger loose on us.. ..then all of us will be in trouble. Move. Baba. Hey, run! You. Get up. Get up. Child, What are you doing? That's enough. Get up. What happened? Did you find your lost property? Baba, I found it. Baba, you are great. Baba, I thought I have missed you. Baba, that tiger? That tiger was my old landlord. - Landlord? Yes. I had done penance for years in his cave. In the mountains of Prayagraj. The poor thing didn't even take any money. - Wow. Since I left without informing him he became worried. By the way even you had gone to meet your Guru. What happened? Sir, I met him what can I say? He is nothing compared to you. Please accept me as your disciple, Baba. Please. What will you do with me, child? I have got no house or address. There are many famous ascetics in this world.. ..with their own temples and hermitages. Go and join one of them. - No Baba. I don't want to join any one. All are thieves. Don't deny me. You are the powerhouse of miracles. All else are burnt out bulbs. Save me. Take me at your feet. - Baba. Baba. Baba. All right. I will help you all. I have taken rest in your city. So I am indebted to you. Just tell me your problems one by one. I will forward all your requests to the global godfather. The rest is all on Him. - Global godfather? Shut up. - Baba. Baba, save me. - You get up. Baba, he is a genuine man. Listen to his problem. Baba. You are leaving a government building.. ..with a packet in your hand. You are right, Baba. That's the bank. It happened last week. It contains your lifelong dream. Yes, Baba. I took a loan of 12 lakhs from the bank. It was robbed. I am ruined, Baba. I am ruined. Help me. A building under construction. A shop behind. A pile of sand and a tree. What does that mean, sir? This is how Baba offers solutions. When I lost my locket he said poop, vegetable, funnel cake. I found it in the toilet behind the funnel cake shop.. ..in the vegetable market. - Yes. A building under construction. A shop behind. A pile of sand and a tree. What does that mean? - Listen. Listen. What? - Mr. Chaubey's shop. Yes. - A building is being constructed there. Yes. - It also has a pile of sand and also a tree. Then what are we waiting for? Let's go. Hail Global Baba. "This is neither friendship nor enmity." "Fate became a puppet in the game of black magic." Hail Global Baba. "The official Global Baba." "Check this out." Hail Global Baba. I found my money. Baba you are great. I found my money. "You remember the Baba when you are in trouble." "Baba is your ambrosia." "Baba is the tonic to get rid of problems." "Baba can get rid of eras of problems." "The one who touches his feet becomes lucky." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." Get lost. Acting smart with me. Look how much we have got in our first offerings. Sir, what are you showing me? You have returned the stuff stolen with such difficulty. We would had had good food with that money. Not you but the priest who would come to perform.. ..your funeral would have had good food. The protection of this entire area has been destroyed. Global bad spirits are eyeing it. It is not possible to stop the thieving going on here. Baba, don't say so. Baba, don't say so. You are our last hope, baba. Please give us a solution, Baba. The one who wants a protection amulet.. ..will have to give one tenth of his income.. ..to the global godfather. This is our global godfather. "He created such an illusion with crocodile tears." "This is where the Baba will operate from." "With the blessings of the global godfather.. ..every house will see a globalized morning." "Look how sick they are with superstition." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "Baba's graph rose like inflation." "Baba has got both curses and blessings." You have got a very difficult problem. Wow Baba. You are the first great man to catch bad luck. "People wash of their sins and head for heaven." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." Take water from the bottom of the river every morning. And you will have to pour it on the top of the mountain. And don't you dare stop. Don't stop. And what will you say on your way there? Global Baba. - Mr. Agarwal. Hail Global Baba. Hail Global Baba. "Hail. Hail. Hail. Hail baba." - They're experts at committing crime. He's recently been released from Tihar jail. "Hail. Hail. Hail. Hail baba." "PM, DM, CM, everyone holds his feet." "They wait until they get to meet him" "Everyone bows down to him.. ..no matter how great they are." "Money is showered on him in great amounts." "Lot of people come to pay homage to the Baba." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "Hail Global Baba." Baba you are great. You have cured my husband. You did what even medicine couldn't do. Say, Hail Global Baba. Open your eyes Mr. DM. This is government land. Government land. Forest land. As per the Indian constitution this land.. ..is preserved for them. For them. The one who is fighting for their lives and hunger. They are fighting for their existence.. ..in your so called moral society. Because Babas and dacoits have taken over their land.. ..with help from the police and the system. Do you have any answer for them? Tell me. Pandit, I did send my officers here 2-3 times. They have been said that this.. ..is a temporary religious camp. And it will be taken down soon. What are you saying Mr. DM. You are talking like a blind man. Do you think this is temporary? This is a permanent slap on your secularism. The paper he is holding looks more temporary than this. Whereas law says that this land belongs to them. Whom should we complain to? Who will protect them? The police who are pandering to the Baba. Answer them not me. Pandit, I will send them an evacuation notice soon. And have them leave this place soon. He will send them notice. The same rigmarole. Government work will go on. You sent notices and they will put stay order on it. You will file a case against that stay order. And they will file a harassment case against you. And this is how time will fly. What will happen to him? He will die soon while waiting for his justice. Forget him. He has lived his life. This is Tulsi. She has born in India, the best place in the world. Her protectors have made her future bleak. Dear, say hello to uncle. You can go and pander to the Baba. You are the DM now. Soon you will become home secretary. What about her? She has taken birth to die. Come. They will issue a stay order. Let's go. What are you doing Gupta? Changing the name of the shop, Pandit. Does your global father only have fathers? Does he have any mother too? He only has a father, priest. He is from a different planet where.. ..they have no mother. Just fathers. Pandit, you are insulting Baba. I am quite because I respect you. Others would have retaliated accordingly. Why are you respecting me? When you can change the name of your shop from.. ..Hanuman Juice center to the name of a thief.. ..who has stolen government land.. ..then you can retaliate openly. Your society is strange. Beware Pandit. Don't you dare say anything against Global baba. (Crowd Chattering) "If anyone tries to attack Baba." "Even the government is shaken." "The one who messes with religion is gone forever." "Everything is finished at just one call." "The saffron robes weigh heavy on the khaki uniform." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." "The time of Baba is bigger than the time of royalty." It is very shocking that the most peaceful district of.. ..the country Kabirganj has become a center of riots. The state government has taken strict steps.. ..and have transferred the DM of Kabirganj.. ..along with half a dozen other high officials. And has announced that they will.. ..find out the cause of the riots. We have with us PC Jacob, the new police chief of Kabirganj. Bhavna. Bhavna. My battery is over. Sorry. Sorry. I will just get it. Just a moment. What kind of cartoons I have to deal with it. Sorry, Mr. Jacob. Just 2 minutes. Why are you saying sorry? Actually I should be thanking you. This was my first interview and I was nervous. Thank you. Mr. Jacob, how will you control the situation here.. ..if you are so nervous? The situation is already under control, madam. The little tension that you see here will be over.. ..after the home minister's visit tomorrow. Just take care of your battery's charge. The police force here is charged up already. Nice meeting you. - Same here. We swear on Global Baba. The hermitage won't be moved. We swear on Global Baba. The hermitage won't be moved. We swear on Global Baba. The hermitage won't be moved. I apologise to all. I have come to meet the people.. ..who have been effected by the riots right now. Please come with your questions to my residence. I will answer them. The minister. - Hail him. The minister. - Hail him. How is your son? Can't you see what is wrong with my son? Why are you all so angry with me? I am worried about the peace of the state.. ..and the security of you people. Is this how you are going to ensure our security? Entire Kabirganj is robbed. You have ruined it. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Greetings Baba. My brother has lost his arm. He might have even lost his head. But your hermitage should be protected, Baba. Your hermitage shouldn't break, Baba. It won't. You all are there. We swear on Global Baba. The hermitage won't be moved. We swear on Global Baba. The hermitage won't be moved. We swear on Global Baba. The hermitage won't be moved. We swear on Global Baba. The hermitage won't be moved. There is the Baba. - Come on. We swear on Global Baba. - You don't worry. The hermitage won't be moved. - Situation is under control. Police is trying... The people want to know who is behind this. Baba. Greetings. Remember me? We met at Allahabad during Kumbh. I also did a segment on you. Oh yes. How are you? I am fine. But your voice. What? You were Mouney baba right? I was Mouney baba. But Global Baba cured my voice. It was miraculous. Then why didn't he perform the miracle completely? I mean he could have made you speak clear. Why are you speaking with a slur? You don't understand. My body is 35 years old. But my voice is only 4 months old. So it is going to be slurry. What are you doing? Baba, I was just checking my lenses. Listen. Come to the ashram. And we will talk. All right. Take care. I will also make your life good. Bye. Take care. (Laughing) Jokes aside, Pandit. Don't you think the issue of the hermitage.. ..on Adivasi land a little tricky and sensitive? Yes, it is tricky. Then is it okay to leave such issues.. ..on such emotional people? What do you want to say? I mean the sensible people of Kabirganj.. ..should come together on this. Otherwise it can blow out of proportion. The sensible people of Kabirganj. Who are they? Sensible people like you and the ones.. ..who follow your ideologies. Who follows my ideologies? Dallu Yadav? Just tell me that you have got a proposal from him. You work in his channel so hail Dallu Yadav. It is not like that, Pandit. You know me. I accept that Dallu asked me to talk to you but... What did he tell you? He must have told you that Bhavna go and request him. Tell him to support me in politics and win.. ..so that he can betray me again. Hello, Pandit. - Hello. I am the new city SP here. My name is Jacob. Welcome. Welcome. Please sit. - Hello. This is Bhavna Sharma. My child. Yes, I have met you. You are a journalist. The batteries are charged, madam. (Laughing) What batteries are you referring to? Is see that your batteries are charged, Jacob. Have you got my arrest warrant? Arrest warrant for you? Why, Pandit? I was the main reason of those riots. I forced the DM to break the wall of the hermitage. Well than I must thank you, Pandit. Kabirganj has turned into hell and you are thanking me. No, Pandit. Actually I have got promoted because of your riots. No, I haven't had you promoted. You got promoted because of your name. Jacob. Jacob, consider this promotion.. ..to be a gift from Jesus Christ. Because the Adivasi people worship them. Her great boss Dallu Yadav is going to play.. ..the Adivasi card this time in elections. Look, he has even called you here. I have heard that even the new DM is an Adivasi. Move. We won't open the gate. Do you know who is he? - Who? He is the home minister of state. He is not even stopped abroad and.. ..you are stopping him in his own state. Look, sir. I don't know about all that. This is Global Baba's Ashram. And here only he reigns supreme. If you want to come in then queue up otherwise you can return. Listen. Listen. Listen to me. - Go, Go away. (Door Opens) Global baba. - Hello. - Hello. (Door Closes) Uncle, he is asking us to queue up. Come, sir. Come ahead of us. - All right. Come on. Move on. - Hello, Baba. Come on. Go and take the offerings from there. Move on. Just think about what you want. The lord will understand everything. He can read people's minds. Come on. Move from here. Hey, send the women there. Hello, Baba. He was born because of your blessings. Bless him. - Come. Ladies go there. Sir, go there. This queue is for ladies. One minute. One minute. I don't have any problem to sit with the crowd. I know that you have more influence in my area than me. No problem if you want to make me realize this repeatedly. Otherwise can we talk alone for two minutes? Yes, Mr. Minister. What do you want from this beggar? I have heard that you can read a person's mind. Now tell me my problem and its solution? Actually you can avail 20% Adivasi vote only.. ..if the 80% majority vote is divided. Not if they are divided under one name? What do you mean? I mean the minority ticket won't work this time.. ..because Baba has united the majority. The rest you have to decide if you want to send the.. ..documents of this land of this hermitage or bulldozers. Come on. Touch my feet. - What? The tradition of the hermitage is that.. ..once the meeting is over the visitor touches my feet. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Now I have a request for you too. A government team will come to survey.. ..the land of the hermitage. Please ask your devotees to enter. You know that no one gives security amulets without fanfare. Neither global godfather nor the government. Bye. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Jacob, you might find it strange. You come here after passing difficult IAS-IPS examinations. And then you have take orders from these ignorant politicians. You are underestimating our democracy, madam. The way everyone cannot become IAS or IPS. In the same way everyone cannot be a politician either. And the one whom you are calling ignorant used to.. ..fight for the common man while.. ..we were studying for our exams. So everyone is there because they are fit to be there. Why have you become so serious? No, I am never serious. I was just thinking that something is surely.. ..special about this Global baba to have.. ..so many followers so soon. He used to be a criminal, who was killed in a police encounter. He would have looked like this Baba if he was still alive. What? Don't misquote me. No breaking news please. The city has calmed down after a long time. Please allow it to remain calm. Please. Come Jacob. Let's go and meet this Baba once. Madam, we are bound by some rules. To stay away from media, rich people and Babas. Yes. - Nice meeting you again. Same here. - Bye. Bye. Bye. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Sorry, sorry. - Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Baba, the children for whom I have given up everything.. ..gives me my food today as if I am bitch at their doorstep. Baba, you are only one my support. - Madam, go ahead. Go ahead. Done. Bless me baba. - Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. From here. Go. Baba, my father sold everything to make me an engineer. How can I tell him that I have failed, Baba? He will die, Baba. - Go ahead. Go ahead. Come. Come. Baba, listen to her problem. Baba, I am sick of life. I have been married for 7 years but I am still childless. My in-laws abuse me as infertile. Leave me. - Manu. What are you doing? Get up. Pay the rent first, then you'll get the car keys. Father, are you okay? When you will give us the remaining rent? Come. Come. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Baba, today someone told me that everyone is.. ..there in their position because they deserve to be there. Take her away. Since then I am thinking, where am I baba? I am nowhere, Baba. I never reached the place where I wanted to be. I sold my dreams for just 17,500, Baba. Just for 17,500. House rent. Expenses for father's medicines. I wanted to study further but I couldn't. Is it my mistake? I wanted to fight my fate. But I couldn't. Is it my mistake? Baba, I wish I could show people what I am capable of. (Crying) I wish, baba. (Crying) Sir, listen to me. She is a journalist. She might be useful to us. (Crying) Global baba. - Hail him. Bhavna. Hello? Global baba. - Hail him. Bhavna. Global baba. - Hail him. Bhavna. Where are you going? I need to leave, Baba. - What happened? Who have wronged you? No, Baba. Please let me leave. I won't let you go. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. I told you I will make your life better. Global Baba wants to meet you. Come. - No, Baba. Hello, Baba. - Yes, disciple. Baba has called her. Baba has called her himself. Come on. No. - Come. Come on. Meet the Baba first. Hail global Baba. Come. Come this way. (Door Opens) Baba has called her. Go ahead. (Door Closes) You can sit wherever you want, girl. I am sorry, Baba. I became too emotional. You must think that I am sad and poor. But it is nothing like that. The atmosphere was such. Everyone was sharing their grief so even I was overwhelmed. You must have seen a few foreigners amongst my devotees. And soon their number will grow. Please sit. Sit. I want someone who can convey my message to them. And convey their messages to me. I think you have knowledge of foreign languages. Yes. My devotees outside Kabirganj.. ..want to keep in contact with me at all times. I have thought to start a TV channel at their insistence. What do you think? It's good. Will you be able to manage my channel? What? You will be paid 3 lakhs a month from.. ..the hermitage for this work. What? Me? - Yes. Think about it. If you like my proposal than come and meet Baba Damroo. Hail Global Godfather. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Baba, some government people have come. Open the gates. Let them come. - Okay. (Door Opens) You will have to deposit your mobiles, guns, etc. here. Done. Yes, done. - Baba. I have given them the Global medicine. Is it good? - Yes. Everything will be fine. You will become pregnant. One more. Global baba. - Hail him. Global baba. - Hail him. Walk properly. What is your name? Sumitra. No. It's Gopi. And I am the one who plays the flute. (Conch Shell Blowing) Hail India, sir. This is mine. - And this is mine. Don't feel embarrassed. - You are the one feeling shy. Play fearlessly. I am master in such game. - Look. Look at this. Look at this. Sir, you? - Hail India, sir. Sir, hello. - Sir please sit. Tea. Tea. - Oh no. Mahender, get some tea. No, nothing. - Sir, please sit. Come. It is an emergency. - What happened sir? I have to discuss something important. Sir, please tell us. Do you remember Chillum Pehelwan whom.. ..we had killed in an encounter? - Yes. Who identified his body? - Sir. We two went to Baliya and identified his body. Go and clean there. Go and play there. Go out. Out. - Yes. Are you sure it was Pehelwan's body? Are you sure? - Yes, sir. He was wearing our handcuffs? Chain. Bracelets. Rings. Everything belonged to him. We couldn't make out his face, sir. I mean the fishes had eaten his eyes, etc. We found out that it is corpse because of the handcuffs. And it reached Baliya through the river Ganga. 'The stiff was his but the body was someone else's.' Manu. No, papa. It's me. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. (Coughing) Give it to me. It decreases tension, right? Let me try it too. Give. - What are you doing? Leave it. I have left it. This is just... Since morning... You haven't gone home yet. This is also our home. We spend half of the month here. If papa was operated on time then .. ..neither we nor he would have been inconvenienced. Listen. - Yes. I have got a huge offer today. But the people seem to be very shady. What? What is the offer? 3 lakhs a month. What? - 3 lakhs. What are you staring at? It's working for the channel. Nothing else. They can employ Barkha Dutt or someone.. ..equivalent to her in this amount. Why are they paying you 3 lakh rupees? What do you mean? What do you mean by that? I mean.. If I had not shouldered your responsibility.. ..then even I would have Barkha Dutt today. (Coughing) Too much. - Bhavna, I didn't mean to say that. I mean to say that if they are shady then join their gang. And have your doubts clarified and be Barkha Dutt. I am there with you. Have I ever refused you anything? Hail India, sir. - Hail India. (Door Closes) Put up in my office. - Sir. Have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you sir. What happened? Any emergency Jacob? Sir, I want say something about Baba... Start discussing stiff with the offerings from Global Baba. Take this. You too. - Thank you. And this is the protective amulet from Global Baba. Keep it with you. It will always protect you. Ghanshyam. - So what were you saying, Jacob? I was feeling unwell since night so I was thinking.. ..if I should take medicines or these blessings from Baba. That's it. - Look. In our country we require both medicines and prayers. You are right, sir. Cancel all meetings. We will do it tomorrow. But Baba only takes 3-4... - No problem. Try to understand. He is a man. With politics he also needs something physical... Hello, sir. - Bhavna, what am I hearing? Are you resigning? - I am forced sir. I have told you before that my salary is not enough. And I said that earn commissions from ads. Sir, I am a reporter. My work is to get news not ads. Bhavna, elections are approaching. Such talks don't suit you. Think about PR. How would be my PR like in the elections? Okay? Bye. Where were you SP? - Some old case. Hello. - Okay. Yes, hello. How are you? Hi. - Hi. Don't greet her, sir. - Why? She is our new sister-in-law. What? - Yes. Good morning, sir. - Morning. Come, Jacob. Come and sit. Vivek! - Yes. Take him away. - Yes, sir. At one time every house had a cow. And now they have these. - Of course sir. Milk can be also got from outside. But it is good to have security inside. Do you know people here were.. ..against your transfer and promotion? They said that Dallu the entire state is against lobbying. In such cases if you give important positions to.. ..the ones loyal to Bhanumati, it will be difficult. Sir, that is problem with our system. Our condition is like that of your dumb security. No matter how diligent we are people consider.. ..us the dogs of the one who holds our leash. Though we are only controlled by the Indian government. Bhanumati also required me the way you did. The DM might have sent a report.. ..regarding the land of Global Ashram for verification. I have verified it, sir. They have illegally usurped that land. It is wrong, sir. That report is wrong. The DM has sent another report. This report states that the Global Ashram's land.. ..is controversy less and free land. Verify it and send the enquiring committee. We will deal with the remaining formalities. Sir, now even this file? This is necessary to continue with the peace, Jacob. This is the rule of democracy. The one who has the public rules. Sir, please don't take any hasty decisions. I think this hermitage is a scam. And global Baba is a bug criminal. I was about to... One shouldn't speak out loud about such specific topics. I know that the Baba is a rascal. And I also know that because of the Baba.. ..Bhola Pandit was insulted. We have got no say here. The central defense minister has come.. ..to pay homage in his court. Who has come? - The defense minister. - Right. I don't know what will happen to Global Baba later. But he has global power right now. Damroo. The hermitage seems quite different. Inside it is even more different. - Really? Everything has changed. Come. - Who is he? He is massage Baba. Don't touch me. Stay away. Go away. Please come. - You need to go with him. Look there. Look there. Real flying birds. Just like 'Kill Bill'. Please go ahead. Go. - Damroo. Nobody is there inside. There no camera inside. There is no problem. Full service. Go and enjoy. Several people have been filmed, Damroo. Nothing doing. Trust me. Go. The Baba is coming. Sure? - Yes. Take him away. Go on. Take a bath while Baba comes here. Have fun. "Sometimes as Ram." "Sometimes as Shyam." "Please do come, Mr. Global. Do come." "Come as a saint." "Come as a saint." "With a drum in one hand and the mighty discus in the other." "Please do come, Mr. Global. Do come." "Please do come, Mr. Global. Do come." This is just scorpion. Is it going to bite me? How many scorpions are going to bite me? Hail Global Godfather. - Hello Baba. Hello Baba. I was refusing but Damroo Baba and these girls... It's good that you have come. - I had to come. The contractor of my department had sung your praises. You are responsible for the security of the people. So someone needs to take charge of your security too. Power is not permanent. Devotees are coming from all parts of the world.. ..to understand this game of worldliness. You should stay here for a few days in the hermitage's tutelage. In the fresh air. You will feel good. As you wish, Baba. Excuse me. This is the long range. See this one. - Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Look here. - Oh yes. Nice. Nice Good. Show more. This is the long range one with throw till 500 meters. Excuse me, sir. - What? Look here. Nice. Nice. Good. And another one is the latest model... You like this one? - ..available only in Italy. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Okay. You mean something shady is happening in Global Ashram. No, I was just asking generally. What is the value of a story if one does an expose.. ..on a Baba and his illegal activities? In the current scenario your story will have zero value. Because if you tell anyone that some Baba.. ..is a fraud, a cheat, a con and that.. ..sex scandals goes on in his hermitage.. ..or anything obscene then people will say.. ..what's new about it. This is what happens there. But if people know that Babas are fraud.. ..then where do all these new Babas come from? Even if they come where do they get all these new followers? Nice, bro. This can be a better story. Bhavna, see you. Mr. Minister. - Mr. Minister. Come on. Bhavna. Let's go. Don't you want to take a bite of the minister? Take this. You can take his bite? - What? You can also take my salary from now on from Dallu. This is wrong. Stop. I have come here first. Global Baba had asked me to meet Damroo Baba. May I meet him? - Your name? Bhavna Sharma. Damroo Baba, someone called Bhavna wants to meet you. I am a journalist. - She is a journalist. Pehelwan doesn't have any record in any station. And the officers who know him are silent because of Bhanumati. Tell them that Bhanumati... Who will listen to us, sir? Bhanumati had not issued a circular report about him. Nor will she. But we do have a hope. We should meet all the people who are connected.. ..to his dealings that we know of. We will find some information or a clue. Look at this, sir. (Gun Firing) Hey! Hey! Catch him. This is Bhavna, he corporate head of the channel. And if any Baba uses Global medicine on her.. ..then I will kill that rascal. She is your global sister. Who is she? Global sister. - Is she only your sister? Global sister. Yes, very good! Go now. Move on. Global Baba. - Hail him. Come Bhavna. - Global Baba. - Hail him. Global Baba. - Hail him. Bhavna, they all are devotees. Bhavna, when I saw you for the first time.. ..I felt that we will make a very good pair. Just like ice-cream. - Baba. Yes. I have come here to set your channel. - Yes. Not ice cream. - May I address you casually? Yes. - You are acting so hard to get. I have done so much for you and.. ..you are not even flirting with me. Thank Mr. Damroo, for doing so much for me. I want to say I love you to you.. ..and you are making fun of me. Your voice is not old enough yet. Let it become stronger. Look Bhavna. - Baba Damroo. I am hurt. Hail Global Baba. Dallu has sent a message. He said that he will resolve our land issue.. ..if we are ready to bless him publicly. Then sir you should bless him. Grahan has seen a few more plots. Global college. Global hospital. We will make a global town. Where did this Grahan Baba come from? He is our minion. Land mafia. A champion in usurping land. And what were you doing with this girl from the channel? Sir, you saw. It was nothing. I was just explaining her the work. You dumb person you were teaching her work. Or flirting with her? A new lot of bar dancers are coming from Mumbai. We have to export them to Dubai with a Yoga camp. What will you do then? If the sweet seller eats all of his sweets.. ..then what will he sell? Sir, this is our personal sweet. Tel me, if you want to have it alone. I will do the rest. You will arrange a girl for me? I will fix you. I haven't taught you a lesson since several days. - Sorry. Be careful. Otherwise you might end up dead. Go and find the history of that girl. And tell Dallu that I coming to meet him. Go. Global Baba. - Hail him. Global Baba. - Hail him. Global Baba. - Hail him. Global Baba. - Hail him. Power Baba. - Hail him. Who is Power Baba? Power Baba. - Hail him. Isn't this the title you are going to give me, Baba? I have dispatched the lease papers to the hermitage. Now please fulfill the rest of the deal. And announce our union. Everyone is waiting. Come. Come. Here is the channel head of our hermitage. Come. You? - She was in your team till now. Now she is with us. - Start. Power Baba. - Hail him. Power Baba. - Hail him. Dallu please tell us that the land on which the Global Ashram.. ..stands which belonged to the Adivasi has.. ..suddenly been declared as infertile land. Are you able to digest this fact properly? The one who cannot digest can contact Baba. Baba has got a lot of exercises to treat indigestion. So Baba, what lesson have you imparted to Dallu that.. ..he became Power Baba from a powerless home minister? I have only taught him to respect public opinion. And Baba said that Dallu because of your dedication.. ..to public service me and all my devotees will.. ..support you in the coming elections. Is that true, Baba? Baba, tell us. Please speak. Do you agree to this? Is he right? - Yes, he is right. I have no doubts towards his industry towards public service. And that's why he has promised to allow us.. ..government land to make Global hospital.. ..Global school and Global College. Dallu, what does that mean? - (Clap Sound) Does that mean you will only serve.. Global Baba and his devotees? What about the rest? - What about the rest? There is nothing else, child. The rest is your illusion. Baba. Baba. One more question. Dallu. (Multiple Reporters Talking At Once) A lot is still left, Baba. You might even know and recognize him. Greetings. They greet Babas, right? It is about how you feel about them, child. You have got a long life. - God has been kind to me. I will pray that you have a long life too. Global Baba. - Hail him. Please Damroo. Please. No. - Come. I will drop you. What? - I will drop you home. Come on sit. No, Damroo. I will go by myself. Please. What are you saying? I will also meet your family and come even closer. Come. Come. Come. - Look, Damroo. I don't like mixing my personal and professional life. So please just let me go. What are you saying? There are no secrets between us. The closer you come, the more fun it'll be. - What are you doing, Damroo? Let me go. - Come with me. Damroo. - Hey. What is the problem? This is our personal problem. Get lost. Let me go. - Every matter on the road is personal. Sir, she is a member of our family in the hermitage. So I am dropping her home. Do you have any problem? Not I but you will have a problem. It will be better if the dirt of the hermitage stays within it. If it becomes public then Babas like you will be in problems. Look down. Look down! Do you know how police looks after their guests? Do you know it or not? Don't worry about the girl. Think about yourself. Go. Go. Shall I? - Go from here. Start the car. Okay, Bye. Take care of her. Bye. For how much did you sell your self-respect.. ..for to these Babas? So you will do the same thing Damroo Baba was doing. Embarrass me. Either you are very innocent.. ..who doesn't understand their ulterior motives. You understand them, don't you Jacob? What are you doing? At least I am not working for those rascals. If not these rascals. Then you must be working for some other rascals. Are there any other people in this world besides these rascals? Everyone wants something here. And only for themselves. Let the world go to hell. This is the global weakness of the people. The one who cashes on it has their governments and hermitages. So only we are left. People like us have got only two options. To work for these government people like you. Or work for these Holy men like me. And hope to keep our self-respect intact. Wow! It seems you have started on a great mission.. ..with complete preparations. Someone might be in some place maybe because.. ..he is able to fight only from there. Having different fighting grounds doesn't mean.. ..that we should have different enemies. 'You must know and recognize them.' 'Greetings. They greet Babas, right?' 'You have got a long life.' Sir. What happened? How many 302 Babas do we have in our hermitage? Several, sir. Tell them that they need to be careful. "Intoxicated eyes." "Sweet talks." "Buzzing like the bees." "The spring I was waiting for has come." "The heart feels naughty, says the wet blouse." "Boys follow you in groups." "Colors blow into your face girl on Holi." "No matter how much you try, I won't respond." "Go away, boy." "Colors blow into your face girl on Holi." "No matter how much you try, I won't respond." "Go away, boy." "With opium and dancing with devotees." "The eyes are now free. And he is having fun." "Colors are being showered. Get wet." "The ascetic is immersed in colors." "He is looking for his partner." "Colors blow into your face girl on Holi." "No matter how much you try, I won't respond." "Go away, boy." "The colors are rough. Red water is being showered." "Look at all this red stuff." "What is this mystery? Where are hiding? They know it." "In Holi everyone is playing around." "A death dance is going on." "Such a web has been woven." "Blood is strewn everywhere." "The land has become red." (Door Closes) Chauhan, call the fire brigade and ambulance. How will you reach such a cunning person? He has removed all traces for us to reach him. You are removing old evidences. But you are creating new evidences. I felt that you have understood.. ..that no one catch me. Wearing a saffron garb doesn't make one God. You are still the same person for me like before. Times have changed a lot, Jacob. Before I was someone's dog. But today I have so many dogs that if I set them.. ..after you then you won't have anywhere to run. Pehelwan you should be thinking of running away. The day I will get one evidence against you.. ..I will kill you in front of the same people.. ..who had made you God. Remember that. Don't make this enmity personal, Jacob. You will regret. No warrior can hurt any Baba in India. If this matter advances that.. ..the animal which is eaten by your community is worshipped by mine. Do you even realize how many people will die.. ..form both communities if war starts? Go Jacob. That day you had given me a chance to run. I will look away today. Go out of the hermitage with full respect. Consider that the death sentence on your head.. ..has been waived off. Global Baba. - Hail him. Baba, I am sick of the quarrels at my home. Before we used to have a joint family. We used to live together. And then my mother-in-law had it partitioned. And since then quarrels have never stopped. What do you wipe your house with? It is an old pajama of my husband. That is the root of all your problems. Change that cloth and make a wipe.. ..out of your mother-in-law's petticoat. Soon you will be globally blessed. Gudiya, go and check what cloth do we use to wipe our house? Yes. It is very important for women to know their limits. If you cross your limits then.. ..the devils outside will nab you. This rape etc. is happening because of a woman's lust. If women can control their lust... Stop! Who wrote this bad discourse? Me. - You? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to be in trouble by saying all this? Baba how will be in the news if you don't make controversies? Such statements give you free publicity worth.. ..millions in twitter, Facebook etc. I will write it if you just want to say good things. But nobody pays attention to such things. Is it? But the youth today doesn't understand things.. ..like emotions, control, limits, etc. And I am only targeting the youth. Please change this speech. - Yes. Baba, phone. Who is calling? - An international devotee. Hello? Hello? Yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Did you record it? - Yes. Bhavna. - Yes, Baba. A devotee from France was speaking in German. Please find out what he is saying. It is recorded. Yes. - Be careful with that. Come here. Sir, this girl is not trustworthy. Don't let her come too close. - Why? Nothing. I also got trapped with the police once because of her. I asked her to sit in the car but she didn't.. ..and created a scene. The policeman came and threatened me. And she didn't even defend me, sir. This girl is not trustworthy. You guaranteed the trustworthiness of this girl, right? And now you are suspecting her. Who is untrustworthy? This girl or you? No, sir. She has a good heart. I can read faces. But she is under pressure. - Mad man. Are you going to tell me if she is under pressure? Her father is in the hospital for the last 7 years. Her brother is in rehab for drug abuse. Sir, you have got her bio data. I was about to find all that. - When? After it was too late. Go and manage your loose change. You cannot manager her. Go. How are you pervert Baba? Pervert Baba. - Witch. Pervert Baba. - Sir, they are from Mumbai. They are taking advantage of me since I was nice to them. Once there deal is done tomorrow I will be free. Everyone is calling me pervert because of them. I am feeling very bad. Jacob, what do I do with this Baba? He sends a new proposal for land every day to approve. And if do approve it I will be jailed for sure. And if I don't approve it then I will lose the elections. Sir, I don't know about the elections but if you want.. ..to overpower the Baba then there is one person.. ..in this state who can do this. - Who? The one who has Baba's entire horoscope. Sir, I will arrange the meeting. It is your job to call Baba. Come Baba. Come. Why is your Dally Yadav such a big politician? It is a matter of a small land. It is not a deal for illegal cocaine to call this secret meeting. It is not that, Baba. The elections are coming. The press is tracking him like vultures. Both Dallu and you will be in trouble.. ..if this deal is made public. Child, my hermitage is founded on all these problems. So don't try to impart knowledge to me. Baba. Baba. it will be better if you go alone. I am waiting him. He has come. Greetings, Baba. I had thought that you had arranged.. ..a great press conference like last time. That conference made me realize of your activities. You made me bend so low at your feet.. ..that my waist is still sprained. Bhanumati. Bhanumati? And here? - (Door Closes) Hey. Don't call anyone. When a person is scared what does he say? Hello. - How are you, Dallu? I am fine. Please have a seat. All right. So you are Global Baba. I have heard a lot about you. Please sit. Why are you standing? I have sent you a personal request. Yes, Mr. Mishra told me about it. Yes. - I am thinking about it. Dallu, can you leave us alone for some time. I have somehow found time to meet Baba. Why not. If you... - Okay, bye. Baba, I wanted to listen to some discourse by you. But what can I do? Elections are approaching. I have to finalize the list of the candidates. We have promised to have a crime free government this time. Isn't that a good promise? Now I don't have time to take your wisdom. So I thought of giving you some wisdom. The hermitage you have in Kabirganj. The minority communities are very angry about it. They don't have much land left for them. What will they do if you take that away too? So I want you to clear off from that place.. ..with that shame of a hermitage of yours. In fact it is better if you leave this state.. ..and start your game in some other state. Tell me, if you have any problem here? I have got millions of devotees today. They might get disappointed. What will I tell them when they ask me where I am going? Tell them that you had an inner calling... One minute. One minute. If you don't mind than I will record your message. What do you mean? Just a minute. Give me a minute. Who is Damroo Baba? - Me. You have been called inside. - May I? - Yes. (Door Opens) Global Baba. - Close the door and take out the mobile fast. We need to record Bhanumati's video. What is this drama all about? These are just 4 lines. Just write it down. No. It is not enough for us to write it down. We need to record it. Don't take my video. Take his. Your boss. You need to take his recording. I get recorded often. You should have one now. What do you mean? - Talk about wisdom. Wisdom. Have you lost your mind? When this cat says wisdom you can hear it. Have you lost your mind? Say wisdom. Wisdom. - Behave properly. Chillum, have you gone crazy? Do you know your standing? My dog... Why have he called him inside? Sometimes we have such co-incidence.. ..that it really feels that God exists. I had never thought that I will get such an easy.. ..chance to take my revenge on her. Look. Why are you struggling? She is resting for some time. She said she doesn't want to be disturbed. Car. Hello? We have received a shocking news regarding.. ..the state assembly elections. Bhanumati has selected Global Baba.. ..as the candidate from the Kabirganj constituency. Dallu Yadav have lost hope.. ..after the advent of Global Baba. - I call you later. Bhanumati has announced Global Baba.. ..as the candidate from the Kabirganj her party. "Sometimes as Ram." "Sometimes as Shyam." "Come Global. Do come." Hello, Mr. Minister. Hello, Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, I am shocked as to why Bhanumati did this. There was no logical reason for this. Who is this? Hail Global Godfather. Where did you get this number from? I know everything. I also know that Bhanumati's favorite dog.. ..Jacob is also there with you. And it is good to say that you have hurt yourself. (Laughing) Did you call me to make fun of me? I am calling you to say thanks. You had arranged such a good meeting with Bhanumati. It was fun. Continue to send such good gifts.. ..to me in the future too. I don't like small gifts. (Laughing) Excuse me ma'am. I just spoke with media head, Gupta. He says that since the time we have added Global Baba.. ..to our party since then upper class people.. ..from the Eastern region are also joining the party. Congratulations. So what is all this wrong Hindi? Why don't you check? What do you want? That I should fail before I even become a minister. I am sorry, Baba. I don't know how... Where is Nepali Baba. Call him. He will be my election in-charge. He has to start my promotion. Why do you need Nepali Baba? I am there. Your PA. I will manage everything. No minister's PA speaks with a slur. (Laughing) Take care of them. That suits you. "Hail. Hail. Hail Baba." This time. - Baba's government. This time. - Baba's government. This time. - Baba's government. I have joined politics so that I can bring.. ..back all the black money deposited abroad. So that our India become a shining golden bird again. I am forced to delve in dirty politics.. ..so that I can get rid of other corrupted politicians. Global Baba. - Hail him. Their income is in international banks. Then why is our income taxed? If you want to save the heritage of India.. ..then you have to get the good and true ascetics to power. The glorious future of our country depends.. ..on the inclusion of Global Ashram in the assembly. Global Baba. - Hail him. 51% seats. That means Global Baba has got.. ..51% support from the public. Dallu Yadav is getting 34% support. And the others are getting 15% support. Uncle. - Yes. Offerings. Call Bhavna. Tell her that it is time to expose the Baba. - Yes. Sir, if you don't mind may I say something? Don't involve her in this matter, sir. Because Bhavna cannot handle this matter. Trust me. - Shut up. I am in this situation because of this. Global 51% and Dallu Yadav 34%. It seems that I haven't done politics for 40 years. What the heck. - One minute. Sir, Bhavna. Hello, Bhavna. Hello. - Bless you. Bless you. How is papa? Listen. Do one thing, dear. He will win. - Global Baba will win. He will win. - Global Baba will win. He will win. - Global Baba will win. He will win. - Global Baba will win. Dallu Yadav. - Hail him. Dallu Yadav. - Hail him. The Baba will be exposed soon. The power of truth... Go. Go. Go. What are you hiding? Show. Check. Baba. - Yes. Tell me, girl. I am listening to you. Baba, I have a request for you. It would be very kind of you if you allow me.. ..to go by the green channel after duty. Do you want to take something outside the hermitage? By stealth. Yes. My honor. The Baba's frisk very indecently at the gates. I don't like it. Good girls are not always smart. Smart girls are not always good. And the one who are both are not beautiful. And the one who is beautiful is not a girl. You are uniquely endowed with all these qualities. I don't understand. You have gone against me for that lowly Dally Yadav. Why? Oh no, Baba. You misunderstand. It's a waste of time and words when two.. ..smart people try to fool each other. You wanted to have your father operated on.. ..for the last 5 years who was rotting in the hospital. He got operated on 2 days ago. Where did the money come from? The hermitage didn't pay it. Are you going to tell me yourself? Or should I show you the bank statements? Dallu Yadav wants to expose me with your help today. No. The way you have made videos of this entire hermitage. You want to give that to him, right? - No. No. Tell me the truth. - No. - Tell me. What is this? - This contains the real stuff. Right? Sorry, Baba. You will work at the Baba's. What? For me. Don't forget that your father is at the government hospital. And I am the government. Sorry Baba. I have to finish the work I have started. Munna. What does this have? He is looking for this. Take it to Dallu Yadav. Please Baba. Please. - Please. Please. Please. Please Baba. - Look. Mannu. No Baba. Please let him go. Baba, please. I haven't done anything. Your bother will be freed as soon as your work is done. - (Crying) My brother. - Munna. - Yes. Take madam out through the green channel. I haven't done anything. - Her wish should be granted. Go. Please Baba. Let him go. Please. "The Baba is a pervert." "The Baba is a pervert." "The Baba is a pervert." "Give it up. Give it up to the bad boy." "Give it up. Give it up to the bad boy." "He is a pervert." "He is a pervert just like a monkey." "He is a pervert." "He is a pervert just like a monkey." "Pervert Baba." Come. Look exchange... Munna. - What is it? Stop. My dress. Come. Come on. Nepali. That girl won't take the green gate. Get inside. Get lost. The Baba has told me. Get lost. Go. "The Baba has a simple theory." "He tales god's name and keeps a girl by his side." "A little property everywhere." "A little hope. And a little life." I am calling here but I am not able to get through to her. What are you saying? - She must be on her way. "The Baba is a pervert." Move. Move. Go away. Get lost. Move. What drama is going on here? Nepali went through the green channel with that girl. When I told him to stop he said you had told him to. Yes, I have. What's the problem? Sir, why don't you understand? That girl is not trustworthy. I keep a special eye on her. Special eye! Where? On her lips or her cheeks? What rubbish! If I had not kept an eye on you.. ..then we would have been ruined by now. Now stop thinking about that girl.. ..and keep a watch at the gate. You are only fit for that. And let Munna do his job. Get lost. Sir, you have given that Nepali my uniform. He was teasing me by wearing it. And you are having fruits alone. What is wrong with you sir? What are you hiding from me? Tell me. Are you my wife that I am answerable to you? Get lost otherwise if I lose my head... - Don't do that. Get lost. Out. "Venerate the mind." "And the fragrance of incense." "The one who touches the loving heart is being blessed." "He looks at the place where your stole gives away." "The Baba is a pervert." Yes, Baba. I am about to reach. Yes.
