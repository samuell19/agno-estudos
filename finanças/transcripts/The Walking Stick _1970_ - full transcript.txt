[rumbling] [train conductor] 'Pass along inside now. Pass right down the car.' 'Pass down the car.' 'Clear the doors.' 'Back up.' [brakes squealing] [train stops] [train starts] [doorknob turning] - So I told them she was mad. - She is. Oh, Benjy, this is my sister Deborah. - Hello. - How do you do? Come up soon, won't you? Arabella, are there hordes of people up there? No, no. Not that many. [laughter and chatter] All calls for myself and Dr. Douglas Dainton, please. Oh, we shall be at 246-8007. Yes. Thank you. You're very late, dear. The bus just crawled. I don't know why you don't use the underground? I do use the underground. Ready, Erica? Hello, dear. You're late. Sarah thought you might be opting out of her party. Oh, no. Are they all medical types up there? Of course not. Aren't you staying? No. We don't want to intimidate the proceedings. You can't intimidate proceedings. I can. Come on. You will go up, won't you? You've opted out on so many of their parties. - Yes, I will. - Good. Goodnight. Have fun. - Hello. - Hello, darling. [murmuring] [male #1] 'It isn't that easy. A painter's got to paint for himself.' Of course, everybody's buying paintings these days. They're just not buying mine. It's as simple as that. [male #2] 'You'll have to appeal to the avant-garde young executives' 'with a few bob to spend.' It's just not me. They'd be better off with prints. Buffet or something. True. Why don't you try the investors? The bloke who buys and sells paintings like stocks and bonds. Because they won't take a chance. They won't allow themselves to hang anything on their.. ...beautifully painted white-stucco walls unless they know it's worth something. Unless they know they can sell it. Deborah should know that type. She meets them every day. Whereabouts? 'Whittington's. The auctioneers.' Oh, yes. I know. Sorry. - 'Charming. Woof!' - Very nice. Thank you. There's a magic word. It's called "Excuse me." Sorry. Are you a good painter? [chuckles] Deborah! What a thing to ask? Don't know. I had an exhibition in a very flea-bitten gallery in South London. But it didn't do very well. [male #2] 'Yes, I remember now. I saw it.' [male #1] 'Didn't buy anything, did you?' [male #2] 'No, I'm afraid I didn't.' [male #1] 'It's okay, no one else did. We'll let you off the hook.' [male #2] 'It'll take more than rejection to do that.' 'Painters are their own worst critics.' We didn't get formally introduced just now. - I'm Leigh Hartley, anyway. - Hello. - Can I get you something? - No, that's alright. I'll have some wine. I must say, the Daintons must have marvelous genes to produce three daughters, all of them.. ...pretty and clever. I met Dr. Sarah about three weeks ago. And then Annabella, Arabella? - Arabella. - Arabella. Yes, the switched-on medical student, right? Now you. - Here. Shall I take them? - Yeah, just coming. Nice drop of red wine. Thank you. I must say, I'm glad you're not part of the guy's hospital brigade. I can't stand women doctors. Why? Why not? They scare me. They're the wrong sex for the job. Like male nurses. - They're, uh, sinister. - Isn't that slightly Victorian? It's old-fashioned, maybe. Perhaps I should have been born a pre-Raphaelite. There weren't any women doctors then. No, they used to burn them then. Perhaps you think that's still a good idea? Excuse me. [giggling] [giggling] [giggling continues] [Leigh] 'You know, your face is very different from your sisters'.' - Is it? - 'Yes.' 'Theirs are modern. Yours isn't.' Rossetti-ish? Very out-of-date, very 19th-century. Would you come out with me sometime? I don't go out very much. Why not? Well, I get home late most evenings. Alright, then, what about a Sunday? Next Sunday? I'm busy next Sunday. Sunday after that? I just told you I don't go out very much. Because of your leg? Morning, ma'am. Morning, sir. Lovely day. - Morning, Miss. - Morning. Morning. They're scent bottles. About 1750. I'd say they're quite valuable. Really? How valuable? Well, they're best-period Chelsea porcelain. They might realize between 300 and 400 pounds each. Are you quite sure? You look very young. Yes, quite sure. Excuse me. Telephone, Miss Dainton. 'A Mr. Hartley.' Would you tell him that I'm not available? I'm sorry. Hartley. National Film Theater. Sunday. Yes, I'll see that she gets the message. Goodbye. 'There you are.' You really ought to talk to him, Deborah. He sounds pleasant enough. Wants to take you to the cinema. Very interesting film on El Greco. Never mind. I think you should go, Deb. I don't think so. [Erica] 'It's a marvelous film.' You're pushing again. There's no need to be so touchy. Wouldn't hurt to go out with a man one night. That's what it is, isn't it? Me going out with a man. Well, stop worrying about me. Don't be so sensitive about the one failure in your otherwise perfect lives. I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. No, I mean, I love "El Greco". I really do. I just thought he handled it in a sort of heavy-handed manner. You know what I mean? - Did you like it? - Yes, I did. [Deborah] I wish Bergman had made it though. Yes, I know what you mean. [Deborah] A subject like that needs his kind of imagination. I take it you like Bergman. [Deborah chuckles] 'Well, I have seen most of his films.' 'The one that impressed me most was, uh, "Wild Strawberries". [Leigh] 'Oh, yes.' [Deborah] 'I saw it alone one afternoon.' 'They weren't many people in the cinema.' 'And as I came out, it was getting dark' 'and I remember feeling very glad' 'when the streetlights came on.' 'It was a very haunting film.' [Leigh] 'Yes, it was.' 'Hmm.' [Deborah] 'I thought we were going for a drink?' [Leigh] 'We are. At my studio.' 'I'm gonna take you in the back door of London.' 'Your passport in order?' [bell tolls] - 'What's this?' - West India Docks. Pretty, isn't it? 'Lovely. Were you born around here?' No, I come from Cheltenham. My father still lives there. I came up to London after my mother died. [Leigh] 'You won't want to look at those after all that "El Greco".' - What? - 'I said..' You won't want to look at those after all that "El Greco". I'd like Erica and Douglas to see some of your work. 'Thank you. Who are they?' [chuckles] Oh, that's my parents. Sorry the place is such a mess. They're mostly stuff from the river around here. This.. That's quite a nice one. There's one I've just finished. Trying something new now with a rubber stamp. An ordinary office rubber stamp. You know, making patterns and, uh.. - Would you like one of these? - No, thank you. Do you sell many? They're all available. Why, are you interested? No, seriously. I mean, how can you live if you don't sell any? I get a legacy from my aunt. She was good enough to remember me in her will. Also I do the odd poster or two. "Car Wash. Ten minutes only. 8 shillings." That's about what I get for it, too. It's funny, isn't it? The most threadbare things in the world are yesterday's smart ideas. Like calling one's parents by their Christian names. Oh, yes. Well, they think that getting on a first-name basis reduces tension and abolishes the gap between generations. How can you abolish a gap of 20 or 30 years? I'm sorry. Perhaps I should have remembered. Never try and claim the goods before the hammer's down. Is that right? Well, think about it. Who wants a girl with a shriveled leg? Imagine in bed, one good leg and the other just hanging there like the discarded tail of a lizard. I was just trying to kiss you. And your leg is not as bad as that. [knock on door] [male #3] 'Open up!' 'Vice squad!' - Oh, hi, Ted. - Leigh. Um, Deborah, this is Ted Sandymount. 'Deborah Dainton.' - 'Oh, how do you do?' - How do you do? Ted's an electrician around here. He works on the ships. That's right. No fuse is good fuse. That's me. I was just about to run Deborah home. Oh, that's alright. I just had a pint. Tasted like wood-shavings. Which way are you going? - Hampstead. - Happy Hampstead. [Ted] 'It's not my way.' Jack asked me to leave this. They're paints and stuff. Toodle-oo! Now, Foil, Jack Foil.. He's the one who provides me with all my paint and stuff. He's got an antique shop in Chelsea. It's called Sefton Antiques. He was the one that arranged my one and only exhibition. You know, the one that David came to. And he's your patron? [chuckles] Patron? Yeah, I suppose he is, in a way. Makes me sound very grand. Well, thank you for a very nice evening. My pleasure. Listen, uh.. It's for you. I know it's not very good. - No, no, really I-- - Please, please, please. I want you to have it. I'd like to paint you sometime. Isn't that the easiest way to get somebody undressed? Oh, God! You're so sensitive. I paint faces. I paint bridges. I paint cranes. I want to paint you. You don't have to take off a thing. No, I'm afraid not. But thank you for the painting. [bell tolling] Goodnight. Well, aren't there any new cranes down there? You'll have to paint somebody else. Not me. And please don't call me here. You're much too persistent and the answer is still no. No. No. Do you always use live models? I have. Often? Once before. Was she damaged like me? [sighs] Shut up. Was she your mistress? Shut up. More than mistress? Look, will you shut up? Sit still and be quiet. Hmm? [birds chirping] Yeah? Right? Deborah, this is Jack Foil. Remember I, uh.. Jack, this is Deborah Dainton. Ah, this is a great pleasure, Miss Dainton. How do you do? You two should get along. You're in the same business. - Junk. - Oh, my dear boy. How crude could you get? Aren't you at Whittington's? Yes, yes, I am. Well, I don't know, but to my eyes 'some of this stuff here' doesn't look too bad of its kind. Would you agree? Generally, I think it is, yes. I don't often come to these viewing things but it never fails to amuse me how every single connoisseur behaves like a conspirator of Verdi opera. Ah, well, it's the gentle art of not looking at what you're really interested in and yet looking at it. Exactly. Now what would you say they're pretending not to be interested in in the porcelain department? An early Meissen, I think. The remainder of the collection is mostly imitation. It comes from a French factory in Lyons, about 1880. Isn't that interesting? And being palmed off as the real thing. I'm sure. Then I'll have to keep my eyes skinned. - I must get a catalog. - You can have mine. No, don't bother. You'll come visit my shop sometime? Thank you. It's been very nice to meet you, Deborah. Oh, you don't mind my calling you Deborah? - No, not at all. - Oh, thank you. Well, see you. Okay. Bye, Jack. Well, that's Jack Foil. Listen, are you serious? Is all this stuff really rubbish? Most of it, yes. Oh. That's charming, isn't it? The old boy gets rich from his brewery. Buys a lot of old knickknacks to impress the local squires and that's what he ends up with. A whole lot of junk. Where's the special thing that you said was valuable? - Where are you going? - Hmm? Oh, it's there, eh? Which one is it? I'm not supposed to look at it, if I'm a connoisseur. It's the harlequin. - This thing? - Mm-hmm. 'You're joking. It looks like a fairground prize.' It is not. It is worth 2,000 pounds. - You're kidding me. - I'm not. You think the owner knows about that? I wouldn't have thought so. It's in among so much junk. Hmm. Well, I know a man who would pay 700 pounds for that. So do I. I don't think we're talking about the same man. Mine's bent. It's quite simple. You look the other way, I open my coat I stick it inside and no one will know. Leigh, please, I-- It's a question of mind over matter. - Leigh, I'm serious. - Ah-ah! Be very careful. - It's very, very valuable-- - It is valuable. Please put it back. Alright, it's a shame. It was a good idea. Here you are. Oop! You want something? Go on, put it back. Salesladies at Whittington's must be very careful of their stock. Come on. [Leigh] 'I think we missed our big chance just then.' 'I mean, we could honestly..' 'We could've nicked one piece of porcelain.' 'You don't really think that's dishonest, do you?' [Deborah] 'Well, don't you?' [Leigh] 'Well, I suppose so.' 'Well, no, I don't, really. 'I mean, it's all imitation stuff anyway.' - 'I could've nicked a phony.' - 'True.' [Leigh] True, true. And what about him? Three generations of brewers, right? I wonder how many people they've exploited to get that place and the pictures and the gear and.. And the Meissen which will be legally sold. [mockingly] Ha ha ha. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I just got cramp. - You alright? - Yes, yes. - You sure? - Yes. Fine. - You want a shoulder? - It's alright. It's gone now. Do you always use your stick, Deb? Yes, of course I do. 'But you can walk without it, can't you?' 'I don't know. I've never tried.' [Leigh] 'I didn't think people got polio anymore.' Yes, of course they do. Anyway, I was a pre-Salk baby. That's pretty grim, isn't it? Don't you have to go in an iron lung or something? Yes, I did. Which left you with claustrophobia. That's why you don't like confined spaces or crowds. That's why you only go to the cinema in the afternoon. Expect once...with you. Yes. I take that as a very great compliment. You should. [melodious music] [no audio] [music continues] [music continues] Are you and Douglas taking separate holidays again? Yes. Hmm. I don't like the implication in your tone, Arabella. No, bearbaiting please. Your mother and I take separate holidays because we enjoy different things. Of course. You wouldn't be mummy and daddy if you didn't enjoy different things. Oh, dear. Deborah.. Sarah has been talking to David Talbot about your young man. Erica, I do wish you wouldn't refer to him as my young man. Did you know he was married? Who? Leigh. - 'Did you know?' - Yes. Darling, your blouse is all undone. [Sarah] 'Have you met her?' No. They're divorced. [melodious music] [music continues] [telephone ringing] Hello. Oh, hello, Leigh. No, I can't talk now. No, I can't this Saturday. Please. Look, if it's almost finished why don't you ask your wife to sit for you? [tires screeching] [honking] Deborah! Deborah, please give me a chance to explain. I've been trying to get hold of you all day long. Look, I wanted to tell you. I swear to you, I wanted to. I just knew that if I did, you'd immediately walk out. You were right. Your car is rolling down the hill. Deborah! Look, look. Her name was Lauren. She came- she comes from Ireland. She now lives in Stratford-on-Avon. I haven't seen her for over a year. It's about time you did. [sighs] Look, it is over. It is over. I don't know the rules of this game. Or if there are any. But I like to live by some. How do I explain it? What do you want me to say? There's nothing to explain. There's nothing left to discuss. - Goodbye. - Alright, forget it. [engine starts] [melodious music] [Leigh] 'And whatever you think, it was not just a grotty affair.' 'It was a genuine marriage, which genuinely went wrong.' I've had lawyers on, talking about a divorce and everything. Lauren's a Catholic and you can't.. It just takes a long time. It's a long, drawn-out business. [Deborah] Why didn't you tell me all this before? [Leigh] Well, I, I don't know. I, I guess I didn't want to lose you. If I matter that much, that's the very way you would lose me. [chuckles] Silly, isn't it? I mean, things people do. I'm sorry, Deborah. There has to be honesty and trust between us otherwise we don't have anything. Ugh, that's an inadequate cliche. I once accused you of being Victorian. Listen, can't we have a drink first? No. Hope the portrait's as good as I think it is. I hope they're all as good as you think they are. [Deborah] We'll soon find out, won't we? [Leigh] Yes, that's a pity. [Deborah] You have to face the experts sooner or later. [Leigh] These sharks aren't interested in this kind of thing. They're only interested in the latest French discovery or somebody who frames his pictures in lavatory seats for a gimmick. Slop art. These are pictures, if you know what I mean? But they're not really- You must forgive me. 'They are not really paintings as I understand the word.' What about the portrait? - Hmm? - The portrait? Yes, the portrait has more feeling certainly. But it's.. It's romantic. It's old-fashioned in approach. Look, Mr. Hartley, it's always difficult to explain this but hundreds and hundreds of people amateurs if you like paint for their own pleasure. Jolly good luck to them. But that is rather different from the professional 'with something to say.' You could be an illustrator. But I personally doubt your success as an artist. I'm sorry. Well, that's, uh, ahem. That's putting it straight, isn't it, though? I'm sorry I talked you into going. Nobody benefits from having their work torn apart like that. I just hoped that-- That there was something there, right? [Leigh] 'Deborah, stay with me tonight.' [ship horn blowing] You must be insane. Wanting to sleep with a cripple. Please. I wouldn't.. I couldn't.. ...stop you from leaving. If you want me to.. ...I'll stay. [ship horn blowing] Please...switch out the light. [dramatic music] It's me. I'm sorry, Leigh, it's all my fault. You're beautiful. Don't worry about a thing. Do you want some coffee? Yes, you do. [utensils clinking] [ship horn blowing] [buoy bell ringing] [ship horn blowing] [buoy bell ringing] [ship horn blowing] What a terrible day it's been...for both of us. Oh, I don't know. Name one thing that could redeem it. There you are, you see? Can't think of anything. [bell ringing] You hear that? That's a start of a new day. Let's try and make this one worthwhile. Let's try and do something good. Like what? Like you deciding to come and live with me...here. I mean it. After what just happened? Oh, God. That's nothing. You think that's going to be our entire life? We'll sort that out. Will you? Please? You have less than an hour to decide. Why? Because then you change back into a pumpkin. That clock just struck 11, not 12 which means the day hasn't ended yet and I'm trying to...redeem it. I love you. [dramatic music] You'll have to watch that dehydrated prepacked, medicated family of yours. 'Once you're home they'll throw the Queen's regulations on you.' 'They won't forbid it.' 'They'll just talk about it quietly and sensibly.' 'You know what I mean?' Why are you being do adamant? Can't we talk about it quietly and sensibly? [Deborah] For once, allow me to make up my own mind 'and decide what's best for me.' - A strap. - Here's a plate. - Oh, here's a key. - Where? - Can't reach it. - Here. God! Look at that. It's absolutely cake solid with stones. ♪ 21 today ♪ That'll be the day. How old are you? Twenty-five. - Moving the barges. - Oh. Listen, I'll make a deal with you. One antique for another. Another plate like the one your sisters gave you for your walking stick. How's that? You know where to get another one? Of course I do. Is it a deal? Mmm.. Well, you get the plate, and I'll think about it. The hell with you. - Hey! - It's all or nothing. Ah-ah-ah! [melodious music] [Deborah] 'Leigh, why don't we go into business together?' 'An antique shop.' How do you imagine we're gonna finance it? [ship horn blowing] Don't know. Don't you have any more aunts? Unfortunately not. [grunts] That's okay. I'll do that later. It should make the party warmer. Ooh, I hope so. 'Cause it's freezing now. Can you help get him up just a minute? I hope you don't mind me not inviting Erica and Douglas. We can do that some other time. I don't think they've ever been to this side of the city. They know Spain better. Ah. [festive music] You bastard. [festive music playing] [music continues] [no audio] - Douglas is having fun. - I'm glad you came. [Erica] 'Well, Leigh asked us. How could we refuse him?' [festive music continues] [crowd cheering] It was a marvelous party. I'm glad. Let's go to bed. - Why, are you tired? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. [melodious music] [music continues] [Leigh] 'You know, your sister..' [Leigh laughing] '...told me that cocoa is an aphrodisiac.' [both laughing] - 'Cocoa?' - 'Mm-hmm.' 'With all seriousness, too.' Mmm. Well, what about crab and things like that? 'Crabs walk sideways. They can't possibly be an aphrodisiac.' [both laughing] Well, that depends who you're with, doesn't it? Crab, oysters...whatever. [Leigh] 'Listen, listen.' 'I have to ask you something, but I don't want to.' Then don't. Nice, isn't it? What do you think? Well, I mean, yes, it's very pretty, but we can't afford it. True. No, I realize that. Listen, come here. I started to ask you something last night. Mm-hmm? I didn't want to, and I don't want to. But there's 500 pounds involved. Someone wants some information about Whittington's. What sort of information? What, about the next auction? No. They wanna know about security arrangements. Watchmen, alarms, things like that. What are you talking about? - Who? - It's nobody you know. Look. It's a little bit dodgy. But the point is it's 500 pounds. And with that we could get the shop. We can get everything. And once we've given them the information I don't suppose they'd do anything about it. I mean, it's just.. Well, Whittington's are insured, aren't they? Won't matter very much, will it? How did you get involved in this? [chuckles] I'm not involved in anything. 'It doesn't matter. Forget it. We can throw it out.' You just said to me "We". Look. It doesn't matter. Forget it. I'll tell them to try Sotheby's. - What are you doing? - Hello. You're home early. Oh, the auction finished early. What's that? Just putting a new pane of glass in here. And doing the door where it sticks. Sorry you'll find it cold inside. I took the door off when sunny and it's windy this afternoon. [Deborah] 'Oh, I see.' Who was that woman just leaving? It was a neighbor of my father's. She was up in town for the day. She dropped by to tell me that he'd been taken ill. Your father? Hadn't you better go and see him right away? - Well, I can't. - Why not? Brace yourself. I have a job. Hey, that's marvelous. Where? Commercial Art Studio in Dover Street. Everyone always said I'd make a good illustrator. So I start tomorrow. Gotta do something to earn my keep, haven't I? 'Now that my aunt's legacy is finished.' You don't sound very enthusiastic about all this. Enthusiastic? Why should I be? It's 17 pounds a week. If we're very very careful and very very thrifty we might just manage to get our shop by 2085, right? Look, if our shop has to wait because of your father's illness then it just has to wait. That's not what it is, is it? You're still thinking of that 500 pounds, aren't you? What did your friends say? They asked me to ask you to think again. What did you say? What can I say? I'm playing for time. I told them I'd tell them on Sunday. Are you scared of something? You get a proposition like this, you chuck it out. I get a proposition and it sticks. Alright, that makes you better than me. I'm sorry. 'That's nonsense and you know it.' For Christ's sake, Deborah. What am I asking? I'm asking for a few extra quid to get the shop. 'So, I can send some money to my father now.' Or get free of loans, so that we can get married. I mean, to you this place is attractive. It's great. It's cute...different, I don't know. But don't you realize, to me, it stinks of failure. I'm sorry. I'll sort it out on Sunday. [dramatic music] [no audio] What happened? What did they say? Nothing. They had a go at me. Well, what does that mean? You know the situation as well as I do. They want the information, and I want the money. They're going through with it anyway. Don't worry. You're not involved. I'm going in with them myself. Do you think Whittington's is some joke? 'You'll never break in. Never. And you will get caught.' Well, I'll just.. - ...have to take that risk. - 'Why?' Why? The place is riddled with alarm systems and guards. It's impossible. You'll get caught and get sent to prison. Do you know, that people get 30 years for doing 'this kind of thing?' Suppose I tell them what they want to know? Will you not get involved with it? It's too late, love. I'm going in with them. [melancholic music] The guards are not ordinary watchmen. They're special detail for places like Whittington's. 'They come on at 7 and stay till 7 the next morning.' [Deborah] 'They set the alarms' 'and then ring up every half an hour' 'and give a code word to identify themselves' 'to the police.' Alarms are all over the place. Windows, roof, doors. Separate alarms can be switched off. But I don't know where the master is. The strongroom's in the basement. Is that it? The basement? That's it. Hmph. This is difficult. According to this, the safeguards are the toughest there are. They're the sort that give the alarm when a particular thing is not done. - Isn't that so, Ted? - Yeah. [Leigh] We know all that. What are we gonna do about it? - Are we gonna chuck it out? - No, no. Don't let's be hasty. [Jack] 'We've got to think about this for a day or two.' 'Don't you agree, Deborah?' [Jack] 'Never despair.' So we don't drop it out, right? Not yet. Thank you so much for the information, Deborah. [Jack] 'I tell you what we've got to do immediately.' We've got to get the names of all the security staff. I've got a list of them. I think I can get one to help us. He's on duty all during the jewel sale. Baker Evans. [Jack] 'Right. Evans must be our man.' The whole thing turns on Baker Evans. Just as the great door of the vault revolves around the tiniest finest jewel bearing. I'd like to go home please, Leigh. Yes, of course. I'm sorry. [Jack] 'Thank you so much, Deborah.' Goodbye. [door shuts] Did you know that Foil was involved? No, I didn't know. Not until today. Ted approached me at the party but he never told me whose idea it was. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I need the money. Can't chuck it now. Come on, let's get out of here. If I could get that money from somewhere else would you forget the whole thing? Look. You know we can't raise that kind of money anywhere. We don't have a sou's worth of security. Come on. As you know, Deborah, it's not our habit to accumulate cash. In principle, we're rather against it. Not that there's been chance with three girls to educate. We're still paying off Arabella's overdraft, you know. 'That's a pretty dress you're wearing.' [Leigh] It's 12,000 quid. Ted says the stuff is worth at least 150,000. 'We get a third of it. We split it four ways.' We end up with 12,000 quid. Ah, here we all are. Don't you get up, Deborah. I'd like you to meet Bertie Irons. Ted of course you know. Deborah, you've been so good over all this 'that I think it's only right and fair' 'that you should be told what's happened.' I'm afraid we've had a rather unfortunate setback. 'Oh, it's one of those things you can't anticipate.' It's nobody's fault. They just happen. Our security man, Baker Evans, was due to have taken over 'at Whittington's this week.' 'It would have worked in perfectly for the jewel sale.' There's been a lot of flu about. He's got a bad attack of the virus. Poor man. You can imagine where that leaves us. It means we can't use him at all. So it's off. Well, for the moment, it has to be. It has to be postponed for a month at least. [Ted] 'That way we'll lose the jewelry sale.' Well, that's the difficulty. That's why we're here. Will you do it? - Leigh? - Don't upset yourself. Leigh, please make them go away. Ask them to leave me alone. - Look, Jack-- - 'Shut up.' 'She doesn't need your protection or your advice.' It's entirely up to her. I have the greatest faith in Deborah's judgment. How many times do I have to tell you? I'm not going to do it. 'Of course you refuse. Anybody would at first.' We spring it on you like this, out of the blue. 'But you must remember it was sprung on us out of the blue.' 'For a time I was absolutely desperate.' 'And then I thought "Deborah.' "She's the one. She's done so much. 'So much to help us and maybe--"' No. But it's so simple. It's really so simple. Nobody's asking you to steal anything, Deb. We're the ones who take the risk. Ted taps the telephone wires to get the code word. Well, that's a risk. And then there's Bertie here, he blows the safe. Now, that's a real risk. Now, what are we asking you to do? We're asking you to kill the alarm on the back door and open it. Well, it's simple. [Jack] 'Sit down.' 'Now, listen, Deborah.' This is the plan that I suggest and I want you to keep to it absolutely. You will wait until everybody's gone. The commissionaire, the staff, everybody. And then you'll make your way down to the basement and into one of those cupboards. It'll be a little dusty, but that can't be helped. And there you'll stay for quite a long time, I'm afraid. I can't get into a cupboard. It's impossible. [Jack] 'It's difficult, I know.' But with your character and your tenacity I know you'll carry it off. [music on radio] [music continues] - Goodnight. - Goodnight. [music stops] [rattling] [rattling] [music resumes] We're all locked up. - Everything okay? - Yeah. - I'll check in. - Cheers. [clicks] Harry. [music stops] - All seems okay. - Alright. [phone dialing] Harrogate Arthur. Yeah. Fine, alright. 'Yeah. Do you have the time, by the way?' Oh, good. Alright, thanks. Bye. [melodious music] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] No. Uh. [intense music] Here. Give me the black tape. - 'Quick.' - Here. [dramatic music] Around the corner. Harrogate Arthur. Yeah. Everything alright down below. [dramatic music] Cut the wire. Prepare the ends. Bloody gloves. That's it. Take it easy. Take it easy. That's it. Where's Ted? Ted. [explosion] [alarm blaring] Get on with it. [sirens blaring] [alarm blaring] [engine revving] Deb? Deb? - It's alright. It's alright. - Leigh? Everything's alright. It's all over. We haven't got much time. I'll be late Must get to work early, okay? Come on. Leigh, are you alright? Absolutely alright. Something in my eye, that's all. The guards. Were they hurt, were they hurt badly? No. Ted had to tap one of them, but he's alright. Are you sure? 'Of course, I'm sure.' - What about the police? - Police? Not a sign of them. We cut all the other alarms. Deb, will you please come on? I'm Inspector Malcolm Miss Dainton. I'd like to ask a few questions. Been with the firm about six years? Seven and a half, in fact. 'What time did you leave last night?' Uh, about, uh, 6:30. No, maybe later. Were the night security guards here then? No, I don't think so. I didn't see them. Do you usually see them? No, not unless I, uh, stay late. Mr. Maitland, what time is the building free of all staff? Oh, uh, between six and half past. [Mr. Maitland] 'Unless, they've got a lot to do.' Which door did you leave by last night, Miss Dainton? The back entrance. Is that usual? Well, I don't know. Sometimes I leave one way, sometimes I leave the other. Did you, uh, looking back now, did you see anything suspicious? 'Anyone loitering near the door, when you left?' No. Where do you live, Miss Dainton? I live in Poplar. Uh, 23 Coldharbour. 'Live alone?' No. I live with Mr. Leigh Hartley. He rents the place. I take it, you're not married to Mr. Hartley? No. [Inspector Malcolm] 'Excuse the personal questions.' 'One tries to fill in the general picture.' 'Well, thank you, Miss Dainton.' 'Hope you won't mind having your fingerprints taken.' 'We're doing the whole staff, including the director.' No, of course not. [soft music] [knocking on door] Oh. Excuse me.. Oh, I'm sorry. Leigh isn't here right now. Oh. Is it his father? Is he worse? Uh, no. No, not at all. He's alright. Oh, well, I don't know what time he'll be back. Why don't you come in and wait? No, I won't stay. Thank you. 'Please, please.' Alright. Why don't you sit down? I'll make some tea. - No, don't bother-- - It's no bother, really. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Deborah Dainton. - How do you do? - How do you do? It's, it's very different. This side of the city, isn't it? Yes. Back door of London, Leigh calls it. - Do you like living here? - Yes, I love it. I think, he's done the place marvelously. You know that we're going to be married when he and Lauren get their divorce? Oh. But she's a Catholic. Oh, I know. Did you know her well? Uh, no. First time I met her was at the church. Uh, might never have met her then, really 'if Leigh's father hadn't refused to go to Ireland.' To him it was bad enough she was a Catholic, let alone Irish. Well, he insisted that they'd be married near home in Clapham. I thought you lived in Cheltenham. 'Uh, no, dear.' No, we've lived in Clapham 22 years ever since Leigh was born. 'They didn't get on, my husband and Leigh.' He doesn't approve the way Leigh lives, you know how fathers are. Asserting their ways, he gets very cross. He doesn't make allowances for Leigh. So, so, you're Mrs. Hartley? Leigh's step mother. No, dear. I am Leigh's mother. You won't tell him I've been, will you? No. Not if you don't want me to. Sarah, what did you know about Leigh before I met him at your party? Didn't know he was married. Otherwise I'd have told you. No, no, I don't mean that. How well did you know him? Hardly knew him at all. I was surprised he turned up at party. David must've invited him. Did he know about my leg? Well, darling, he knew that the minute he met you. But did he know before I met him? Deborah, is there something wrong between you and Leigh? No, no, no. Just try and think. Well, David might've told him. Or Jack Foil. I really don't know. Foil? That friend of Leigh's at your fireworks party. - Where did you meet Foil? - Look, what's all this about? I just have to know some answers. Please, Sarah. [engine rumbling] I met Foil in his shop, Sefton Antiques. That Rockingham plate, Arabella and I gave you for your birthday, I bought that at Jack Foil's. Did you tell Foil where I worked? I told him you were the Porcelain Pro at Whittington's. 'I had to impress him, so that he wouldn't' 'fob me off with just any old plate.' Oh, Sarah. 'We've checked the staff. They're all clear.' The company's screened them very carefully, although could be a slip-up, but I doubt it. Whittington's employees seem impeccable. 'We're in a bit of a cul-de-sac, I'm afraid.' [soft music] - 'Hello, love. Where are you?' - Here. Sorry, I'm late. Had to work. 'Oh, God, it's cold out.' [Leigh] 'Fearfully cold. What're you doing, hiding up here? Just doodling. - How are you? - Fine. - You see the police today? - No. - Not at all. - No. Good. What did I tell you? Huh? 'Everything is gonna be alright. I promise. One hundred percent.' Why did you tell me that your mother was dead? Who told you that she wasn't? Oh, I just ran into someone who knew you as a child. Why did you tell me that? [sighs] I don't know. Just silly little stories, you know? Stupid.. Like, you're 22, not 25. And lived in Clapham. Not Cheltenham. What on Earth is wrong with Clapham? I don't know. Are there any other silly, little stories between us? Deborah, yes.. Probably.. ...a stupid thing. Like, what do you mean? Well.. ...Lauren, for instance? Deborah, I have told you everything about Lauren. All of that is the truth, I swear. What do you swear about Jack Foil? What is this? Inquisition? Look, I found out about Jack Foil at exactly the same time, that you did. You know everything that went on and how difficult it was for me. Didn't Jack Foil send you to Sarah's party just to meet me? [sighs] 'Sarah bought that plate from Jack Foil' and she also told him where I worked because I asked her. Oh, look, this is just so ridiculous, Deborah. I.. [sighs] Is there a really, Leigh, a guard named Baker Evans? Wasn't I the fine jewel bearing? It was all premeditated. Wasn't it? [sighs] Oh, Deborah. Now, listen to me. Listen to me. Okay. It began like that. I mean it, it didn't begin like that exactly. It was, it was just, it was just an idea. I mean, will you listen to me? Listen to me. Just meet her and, and, and, see what happens. It started like that but it did not end like that, now, did it? Hasn't, has it? Hasn't it? Seems to me, it's ended exactly like that. No, it hasn't, Deborah. Because I love you and you can't fake that. Of course, you can. What's love? Love is sex, hate, ambition, selfishness you name it. Think I've been playacting all this time? I don't think you know when a playacting starts or stops. I mean, did you tell Foil everything I said and did? So, perhaps, you can plan a little more easily. Did you tell him we were good in bed? Oh, hell! Deborah, stop it! 'And you say, you fell in love with me.' Did it ever occur to you to stop using me? Yes. Yes, you know why I got into it in the first place. I got into it because we needed money. Because weneeded the money. Or you just couldn't refuse Mr. Jack Foil. After all, he is your patron, isn't he? Alright, I'm a stupid git. But you want everything black and white. That's not the way it happens, Deborah. Sometimes the good does overlap the bad and the other way around. Peoples' motives are not that clear-cut. I know what it's done to you. - I understand-- - How? How on God's Earth can you ever know what's it's done to me? You don't even know where to start. Everything I believed in, about myself about others, you, the whole balance of my life, is gone. Balance? I don't know what you mean by balance. You don't? Well, I'll explain it to you. Because balance is trust and security and honesty and caring and warmth. And being able to look people in the face. - Not lies. Not all these lies. - Alright. You want another lie? There are lies and lies, love. I'll give you a lie. I did not work late tonight. You know where I was? I was at the Bleeding Estate Agent's getting these. You know what these are? They're forms for the shop which we've to fill in to make a deal. Now, I did that for us. For you and me, right? How can I know that, that those forms are not just another of Jack Foil's little schemes? How do I know that you work on Dover Street? How do I know you're trying to get a divorce from Lauren. How can I know anything? Could you look at it from my point of view for one moment? 'I don't know what to say to you, Deborah?' Alright. We'll go tomorrow to the lawyers. We'll ask him, he'll tell you about Lauren and he'll tell you about the divorce. What more can I say? That's not what I've just said to you. 'What did you say?' What's the point? What do you want? Revenge? 'The fact that we love each other, is the point.' Not whether I lied to you. Not whether the job was planned. Not Jack Foil or Ted Sandymount. Nobody. My God, Deborah, you know about us living together, don't you? I mean, you can believe your own feelings, can't you? Are you trying to say that all our days together and all our nights together were a lie? Look, remember, that first night we slept together no matter how it happened, no matter what the reasons were. That doesn't make what you felt, untrue does it? Does it? Why can't I get through to you? Don't you love me? Of course, I do. That's the whole problem, isn't it? [sighs] Right now, my.. ...my mind feels, uh, as useless as my leg. I love you, Deborah. Very much indeed. Do you? Am I going to have to confirm.. ...your worst suspicions before you'll believe.. ...anything I say? There's no living with that. [sighs] Is love as fragile as that? All at once, everything. All at once, nothing? [soft music] [music continues]
