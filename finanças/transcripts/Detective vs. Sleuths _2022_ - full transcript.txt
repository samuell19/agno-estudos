Sounds of water on both sides and a bridge at the front door. On the 29th step down, I heard pinwheels. A turn, then another 38 steps down. There's a narrow staircase further down. Lots of tiny shelled nuts on the ground. The Butcher Case I have to remember the path. I have to catch him. I have the victim at Tai Kei Leng nullah! Between the two villages! Miss! I'm a police officer. Keung didn't kill anyone! He didn't kill no one! Keung was framed! Keung didn't kill no one! Keung didn't kill anyone! Stop framing Keung! Keung didn't kill anyone! I'm Auyeung, Yuen Long CID! Put that down and let the kid go! Put that down! I didn't kill no one... Put the kid down. Put her down! Put her down! Papa! Papa! Four years later The Devil Cop Case My twin boys got into their first-choice schools. My wife's over the moon! My son only got his 7th choice! School-hopping for open slots was exhausting! 31122, did you raise Dispatch? Is it an emergency? 5357, what's wrong? Are you under attack? Are you under attack? Hang in there, Ming! Ming, can you tell me what happened? - One, two! - Hang in there, Chit! I was hurt worse 4 years ago! It'll be OK! Chit! Is he the prick that shot you? One, two! He's a cop. I found a warrant card on him. Fong, Kwun Tong Crime Squad. Why did you shoot your fellow cops? Yee, where's your boyfriend? In there. Fong, what happened? He's a cop, a EU driver in Tsuen Wan. Remember the Tai Fat Securities heist with the murdered guard? The perp was never caught. The gun in the robbery was stolen from a cop who was murdered two years prior. CCTV showed the robber had white sneakers with red Shoelaces. One, two! He's holding a rusted .38. The serial number matches the stolen gun. You son of a bitch! You already killed one cop, now you've killed two more for another heist?! - Settle down! - OCTB's here! Yam. What's up, Auyeung? The guy that just got carted out is a cop killer. Killed a PC two years ago. Stole his gun, killed a guard... On the night of the 4th at 1 a.m., Two PCs exchanged fire with a suspect in an alleyway in Kwun Tong. Three were pronounced dead. A similar case occurred two years ago in North Point. PC Choi was ambushed and killed - by an assailant. - You nut! - His gun and - I'm your daughter, - speedloader were stolen. - not a suspect! - The killer on the 4th - I hate you! - Had a .38 Smith & Wesson. - I hate you! An inspection by our firearms forensics team confirmed that the murder weapon was the late PC Choi's missing gun. We have confirmed that the suspect is Chun, 3 EU driver in Tsuen Wan Precinct. Shame! Yan, you're dead wrong! Posing at a crime scene doesn't make you a detective! Stop right there! Stop the car! Detective Lee, you're on suspension! Scram! Commissioner, can you confirm there were only 3 men at the crime scene? Do you agree that Chun Chi-to is The Devil Cop? Yes. No! Detective Lee, stop! You're all wrong! He wasn't The Devil Cop! You're no Commissioner! You're demoted! Jun... Detective Lee, don't... The victim isn't the perp! Go back to school! Detective Lee... Chun wasn't The Devil Cop! There was a fourth person at the scene! Chun was snatched when he left work. The killer dragged him to Kwun Tong. He shoved a gun in Chun's mouth and hid in the alleyway. BANG! BANG! The PCs are shot and can't talk. The killer uses Chun as a shield. 31122 fires back, 5 shots, 2 hits. At the T-intersection. 5357, 6 shots, 3 hits! 3 rounds left! BANG! BANG! Two shots at the PCs. Finally... BANG! The killer shoots Chun in the mouth, then shoves the gun in his hand. The stolen money was in his locker with Tai Fat Securities' cash box. He was framed! Just like the Butcher Case 4 years ago! The evidence was planted! You got evidence, but no witness! The suspects were killed on the scene! CID's Auyeung was in charge of both cases. He's very fishy! That prick's methods are fishy! I'm not the fishy one, you are, asshole! The Butcher Case was botched! The Devil Cop Case was botched! They died in vain and left their families behind! Trust me, I'm the Chosen Sleuth! I've never been wrong before. I solve every case! Trust me, I'm the Chosen Sleuth! I'm never wrong. I'm the Chosen Sleuth! I'm the Chosen Sleuth! Seventeen years later The Chosen Sleuths Case I finally got revenge for you! I'm so sorry - to keep you waiting! - Let's split! Madam, OCTB's here. What happened, honey? There was another torched corpse case here 20 years ago. The victims were the married owners of this wholesale market. The methods were pretty brutal, so Crime Squad thought it was over a debt or a triad turf dispute. No one was charged in the end. These three are the owner's older brothers. They took over the business, but they sold it five years later and split the cash. No one ever suspected them. So someone thinks the victims killed the market owners then used the same methods to get justice. These are our case numbers. The perp must have police connections. Eight sets of handwriting, so at least a dozen suspects... 21 cases numbers: 19 missing persons, 2 "dead body found". All female victims. Their next target may be a serial killer. Leaving a sneak preview at the murder scene... With a calling card... Out of the way! "The Chosen Sleuths" The 21 case numbers that form the characters are all from missing persons and DBF cases. Their next target may be a serial killer... (German) "Whoever battles monsters..." "Should see to it that he does not become a monster himself." "...become a monster himself." "...should see to it that he does not become a monster himself." Chosen Sleuth, help me! Someone's killing in your name! I'm their next target, Sleuth! Who the hell are you? You must remember me! You're the only one who suspected me! The night shift cabbie in Kowloon! It's me, Lau Kwok-wan! I go berserk when it rains! The psychopath who killed 21 girls! The flight attendant! The restaurant receptionist! The student! The lounge hostess! I chopped them and tossed 'em in the sewer! You called me... The Rainy Night Monster! I don't save scum. You still have to save... Why?! I may be scum, but I'm human, too. They call themselves "The Chosen Sleuths". They kill, then leave case numbers as previews for the next murder. They're challenging the police! Auyeung! Out of 21 cases, 19 are missing women. Two victims' remains washed up in the harbor. A serial murder needs 3 linked cases, so OCTB wasn't called. That's how the psychopath got away. The cases cover a long period, from '85 to '93... The disappearances all happened at night, from 22:30, student goes missing after a banquet. Latest one was at 04:00, lounge hostess went missing after work. They had different backgrounds: Nightclub hostess, office worker, flight attendant, newspaper editor... 14 cases in Kowloon, 5 in New Territories, none on HK Island. It's such a wide area. The perp must've had a car. No report of forced abductions. They likely got in the car voluntarily. Must be a night shift cabbie in Kowloon. Call the Taxi Association. Ask for drivers who stopped driving in '93 for illness or jail. Where are you going? My taxi firm is on Fa Yuen Street! You quit in '93 because of Parkinson's! Oh, right... That's right. - My sanatorium is... - On Bute Street! Those "Chosen Sleuths" must've imitated you and killed in the rain. It was pouring last night. I bet you're in the sewers already. Let's collect your corpse! No! I don't want to die! Hurry, step on it! A Parkinson's patient was reported missing 3 days ago. Lau Kwok-wan, diagnosed in '93. Claimed to be a cabbie in Kowloon... Oh no! I've really croaked! Marine Police just reported a floating corpse in Tsuen Wan. It's cut in half! YMT, Yau Ma Tai Precinct. RN9... That's in the '903. Which year?! That's an entire decade! I'll know when I find your bottom half. Where is it? Where did you dump your corpses? In Nai Chung! I dumped corpses in Nai Chung. Those "Sleuths" must've dumped you there! We'll look in Nai Chung! You have to catch those "Sleuths"! Show your daughter that you're not a nut, but the Chosen Sleuth! Go, Sleuth! Your father isn't a nut, he's the Chosen Sleuth... OCTB's here. They only found half the case number. It's in Yau Ma Tei in the 90's. Ask Marine Police to find the rest. Send 4 teams to YMT. Someone filmed 3 Icon fishing the corpse. Looks like it's Jun Lee. It's really him. Tell patrols to detain on sight. Yes, sir! I'm not a nut, I'm the Chosen Sleuth... Every serial killer has a trigger. What was his? Thunder and rain! Helen Yau, three days of equally weather! Sandy Yim, a week of pouring rain! Mandy Kong, black rainstorm warning! Is there a sewage outfall where the half-corpse was found? Yes. Call Drainage Services for maps. The other half may be in the sewers. Copy! Stop! Jump! Jump! I'll die! Don't you want to see your daughter? I really do! Then jump! I'll jump! Jump, man! Let her know that you're not a nut, but the Chosen Sleuth! - Jump! - What are you doing there, sir? The Chosen Sleuth is working. Jun Lee, Serious and Botched Cases Bureau! Back off, West Kowloon DCU! How'd you know we're West Kowloon? 39633, Yee Chan! Dubbed the "Lady Sleuth of West Kowloon"! A relentless investigator, like me. But you screwed up when you suspected Chun as the Devil Cop! You were duped by the real killer! Can you tell me what case you're working on? 20 years ago, a cabbie killed women on rainy nights. He dumped the bodies here. "The Chosen Sleuths" cut him in two and dumped him here. His top half washed up in Tsuen Wan. I only found the precinct code YMT on it. The rest of the case number is on the bottom half, stuck in this sewer! Hey! The loon's been washed away! Go west, there's an open-air nullah up ahead. Jun Lee, former OCTB Chief Inspector. Discharged a year after his wife killed herself. That year, he was investigating a refugee boat murder with Yan. He claimed he saw a demon. Why didn't you shoot the demon?! What demon? It was thin, like a hungry ghost! It had huge wings! Were you blind?! Yan and the others only saw Jun firing at air. Fire Department searched for days and found squat. The doctor diagnosed him with acute paranoia. He was transferred and disarmed. Then he overstepped his bounds, hoarded cases, accused others of botching investigations. He became a pariah. Got discharged for pulling a gun at the Devil Cop press con. Sent to the Psych Center for 5 years. The doctor said he suffered from hallucinations. He says there's an OCTB squad in his brain and that he sees perps confessing to him. Involved in 19 Insane Person cases after release. He set himself on fire at the wholesale market, said he was on The Torched Corpse Case. He jumped into a nullah. Took three rescue teams to save him. He said he was after the Rainy Night Monster. Jun Lee is a legend in the Police Force. He was nicknamed "The Chosen Sleuth". He investigated both cases we have. He may be connected to these "Sleuths". The second half is 7103843! Flying Corpses Case! The Three Tigers threw a family off a building on Temple Street. "The Sleuths" are about to do the same to them tonight! Get in the car! Can't you see it's full? Take another car! How can a cop be blind?! - Cissy, call it in and watch the corpse. - Yes, madam! - Get to Temple Street! - Yes, madam! Step on it, damn fuzz! The three pricks sitting in the back killed a family because they couldn't reclaim a flat. Hey, we didn't do it. Our men did! It took us 8 years to reclaim that street. That family was the only one holding out. The financial crisis hit and we lost a fortune! That family deserved to die! We didn't kill them all, we spared the son! You didn't spare him! He was hiding under the bed, you low lives! But you still have to save us. So hurry up, you fuzz! Call me Detective! I'd let you die if I wasn't a cop! You're not a cop anymore, you can take it easy. I am a cop! Once a cop, always a cop! Before I solve all the cases and catch all the perps, no one can fire me! The police needs me! Hello? Lai, Temple Street Flying Corpses Case. Copy. Temple Street. - C Team, with Lai! - Copy that! - B Team, two cars with me! - Yes, Sir! Beg! Beg my family for forgiveness! I'm sorry! Beg! OCTB's here. We were wrong, we'll pay anything... How dare you?! Our gang has 30,000 men! We're not gonna make it! Hurry! You and you, follow me! You three, front stairs. You four, lift lobby! Put on your vests! Get ready to open fire! Open fire! Open fire! Police! Don't follow me, preggo! Go! Run! Run! The next case... Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter Human Soup case! Move! It's dangerous, preggo! Police! Go! Stop following! Go! Put your guns down! Police! Out of the way! Fong, it's Yee! Out of the way! Freeze! He's Jun Lee, not one of "The Chosen Sleuths". He led us to the "Sleuths". Are you okay? The baby's okay. Let that nut go. The baby says it's okay. How fierce! It even cheered me on. This is SP Auyeung, OCTB! Put down your guns! We just want revenge, we don't want to hurt anyone else! Step aside, OCTB! Evacuate! Move! Are you insane? That's Jun Lee! That nut brought those cops there. He got our guys killed! He's not a nut! He's the Chosen sleuth! Chosen Sleuth! Chosen Sleuth! ABD RN 96076888! We did it! That's Baldie! I'm Fishmonger! 1996, Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter Human Soup Case! Shut up, you two! Why didn't the girl let them shoot me? Find me and you'll find the girl! Come to Tuen Mun! I'm in Sam Shing... He's too far away, I'm closer! I operate a lorry in Yau Ma Tei! Save me first! Shut it. I beg you! I'm dead meat! They're going to cook me! Please save me! I'm scum, but I don't want to be soup! Please, I beg you... I'll pray that you solve every case. (Ian knot) Get this to TSD and see what's in the tape. Copy that. We killed six perps at Temple Street last night. Two more are in a coma. The lobby one is the son of the Tigers' victims. The two in the stairwell are two of the missing women's sons. One of the two dead perps on 8/F is the son of the Torched Corpses victims. So these killings aren't random. The victims' families are taking revenge as a team. The next case number is the Typhoon Shelter Human Soup Case. Check on the victims' families! (Typhoon Shelter Human Soup Case) ("Baldie" "Fishmonger") Take photos and send them to Fong! Yes, sir! I got their IDs. Baldie. Fishmonger. They lived in Aberdeen when Human Soup happened. Baldie works shady bit jobs in Tuen Mun. Fishmonger operates a lorry in Yau Ma Tei. All these cases are connected to Jun. Everyone in his notes ends up dead. He was first on the scene at the nullah and Temple Street. This smells fishy to me. Get a warrant for his arrest! Move this away. (Suspects were framed) (Auyeung is fishy) You keep calling me fishy... You're the fishy one! Lok Ma Chau Immigration Control Point OB GYN ward. Jun Lee, Serious and Botched Cases Bureau! Urgent call for DCU's Yee... 1:30 bus for Panyu, one ticket. 1:30 bus for Panyu, nine tickets. Hello? Why the hell didn't you answer?! I'm working. Why the damn rush? Haven't you seen the news? "The Chosen Sleuths" are murdering people! I'm running! It's not like God sent them! Think they'll really find us? Grow a pair! Why are you standing?! You're blocking my view! Hello?! Fortunately, the baby's heart rate and fetal position are normal. But after a fall like that, you need to stay for observation. Thank you. There's some Serious and Botched Case Bureau who keeps calling for Inspector Chan. Jun, where are you? Near the border. I've been calling all morning! Baldie from the Human Soup Case is taking the 1:30 bus to Panyu. "The Chosen Sleuths" are following him. They're about to cook him! Call your husband, Fong. Get the local division to send in SWAT! What Baldie? Human Soup Case? Hello? A report came in from Yau Ma Tei 5 minutes ago. Fishmonger was attacked on her lorry! This is Yan Wong. Jun saw "The Chosen Sleuths" tail a guy named Baldie, a suspect in the Human Soup Case, at the border. He's taking the 1:30 bus to Panyu. I'm on the way! Jun and "The Sleuths" are nuts. You can't go! Jun is the key to solving the case! I have to! Yee says Jun saw Baldie and "The Chosen Sleuths". 1:30 bus at the border. Chu, Lai, take Teams B and C to the Typhoon Shelter. Copy! Call Auyeung! Yes, madam! The border area is restricted. I'll call Customs. Leave your guns. Customs will intercept before they reach the border. Those pricks ran so quickly on Temple Street. I suspect a mole. In OCTB or West Kowloon... You're alone? Where's your husband? OCTB? SWAT? Fong will be here in time! Dispatch said there were 4 attackers. Search the entire shelter! SP Auyeung! There's smoke coming from that boat. They really cooked her! Revenge's made them insane! Turn around! The leader isn't here. Why didn't she fire at you? Maybe she's Keung's daughter, from the Butcher Case. Papa! Papa! "The Chosen Sleuths" must've gone to my hideout and read my case notes. That's how they found their targets. Keung's daughter is the leader. I wrote that her father was innocent, so she didn't kill me. That case was solved... I've been saying for 20 years, - he was framed! - Sit down! Auyeung's methods are fishy! You seem fishy to me, too! And so does the driver. She's the leader. Where's your daughter? Is everyone OK? Pardon me! The Devil Cop's son is Chu! The Butcher's daughter is Lai! Why? Why?! The Butcher Case? Shit! The Devil Cop has shit to do with me! HK Customs! Put down your weapons, let the hostages go! Cook him in the asphalt! Who will you kill for The Butcher Case? Is it Auyeung? I suspected him, but it's not him! (German) "Whoever battles monsters..." "Should see to it that he does not become a monster himself..." Let's go! (German) "Whoever battles monsters..." Inspector Fong, Inspector Cheung! "...should see to it that he does not become a monster..." The Butcher Case... Why is it our case? (German) "Whoever battles monsters..." "...should see to it that he does not become a monster..." Stop calling them "chosen"! Stop turning them into gods! Killing people and leaving case numbers aren't solving cases. It's murder! Cops who have been hurt and killed are the real heroes. OCTB and all 30,000 officers in the Police Force will do all we can to stop these criminals and restore order! Inspector Fong! Fong... We've lost two guys... Yu and So... Nab those pricks before sunrise and save SP Auyeung! Yes, sir! Madam. (German) "Whoever battles monsters..." He was speaking to his daughter in code. "...should see to it that he does not become a monster..." Jun Lee may be "The Sleuths". I'll grill him. Yee. Those "Sleuths" left two case numbers, Butcher and Devil Cop, and they nabbed Auyeung. We went to Auyeung's home to see if the bastards bugged it. We found the speedloader that was missing in the Devil Cop Case ...and these evidence. (Student ID) Keung wasn't The Butcher? Now it's Auyeung? Have you really forgotten his face? He's the one who tortured me for three days? He... He's me and my husband's best friend! Did you torch those three men at the wholesale market two nights ago? Did you chop Lau up and toss him into the sewers? Did you toss The Three Tigers onto Temple Street? Did you commit all these murders? Why did you turn this bad?! Why did you turn this bad?! I want people to know that my father isn't a nut, but the Chosen Sleuth! Lynn Cheung! Real name Lynn Lee. Took your mom's last name out of spite for your dad. In and out of the reformatory since you were 14. Arrested for burning a cop car at 24. That's when you met Chu and Lai. You knew they were Chun's son and Keung's daughter. You showed them your dad's writings under the bridge. You recruited them to "The Sleuths" to be vigilantes! You can't possibly see her! Of course I can't! I don't know if you're really nuts or just pretending. But Auyeung was taken after you suspected him. Devil Cop and Butcher are the next cases! Where are you keeping Auyeung?! Auyeung isn't The Devil Cop nor The Butcher! I just said his methods are fishy. I never said he's the killer! Those "Sleuths" twisted... the words I wrote. You are the "Chosen Sleuths"! The force didn't want you... You felt undermined! You pretend to be wronged and righteous, but you're just disgruntled. You fooled those kids into revenge, "cracked" the cases to play the "Sleuth"! I didn't! Even if you didn't... Your daughter is the prime suspect. She got Chu and Lai to instigate the victims' families in the name of revenge. They brainwashed the others into committing murders and they believe they're doing the right thing! You taught your daughter to not become a monster while fighting them... but you're a monster! So is your daughter! The most wicked criminals in Hong Kong's history! Chu's computer has a virus! "The Sleuths" are hacking us! Inspector Fong, look! Someone's hacking OCTB! - "The Sleuths" has a hacker! - I'm OCTB Superintendent - Track their IP! - Auyeung... I'm The Butcher... I'm The Devil Cop who moved the corpses and framed... The Devil Cop Case happened 17 years ago tonight. I killed him during the arrest... We're out of time. Let me go after them! - If you're really crazy... - I killed PC Choi... You go to the psych ward. If you're pretending, you're going to the Slammer! ...and killed the guard Take him to the holding cell! ...working there. In the alleyway in Kwun Tong... I killed PC Chit... The Devil Cop Case - happened 17 years ago tonight. - ...and Ming. - They'll strike at the same time, 1 AM. - And pinned it on Chun, - Locate them right away! - the EU driver. Yes, madam! The truth is... I'm The Butcher... I'm The Devil Cop... I'm OCTB Superintendent... Take my car and go home. It can't be Auyeung. - Go home. - No, listen to me... - Just go home first. - It's impossible. Go home, damn it! ...moved the corpses and framed Keung. I killed him during the arrest... Wait. In the alleyway in Kwun Tong, I killed fellow cops... And pinned it on Chun, the EU driver. I'm OCTB Superintendent Auyeung... The truth is... A Team, track the message source. - B Team, call TSD - I'm The Butcher... for the IP address. - C Team, firewall. - I'm The Devil Cop... Yes, sir! In the Butcher Case 20 years ago, "OCTB Chosen Sleuth" Auyeung, who has confessed to being the Butcher, killed Keung. Mentally handicapped, Keung said he was framed before his death. Auyeung isn't The Devil Cop nor The Butcher! I have to stop my daughter! I misled them to Auyeung! I can't let them kill Auyeung! Auyeung is your friend! "The Sleuths" will execute Auyeung at 1! There's no time! Open the door! Let me in! Freeze! Stop the car! He's in a car, H89518. They're going up! Stand by! ...and pinned it on Chun, the EU driver. Can Auyeung be Butcher and Devil Cop? If Keung can be framed, so can Auyeung. Jun swiped a gun, someone picked him up! I'm OCTB Superintendent Auyeung... Stop the car! Stop! Jun really is the leader of those "Sleuths"! Your wife's a "Sleuth", too! Uncuff me! We have two hours to solve two huge cases and save Auyeung from "The Sleuths"! (Fong) Access their GPS! Multiple media outlets received the video of "OCTB Sleuth" Auyeung confessing to two major cases. The city is in shock... I looked at 3,000 missing person cases. The Butcher killed at least 30 women. A college girl is the only one that got away. Her identity is confidential. You've been looking for 20 years! How will you find her now? Where was she found by the police 20 years ago? Tai Kei Leng Village! To Yuen Long! The Butcher killed 30? But they only dug up 5 corpses on Keung's land... Five's enough to frame Keung! Just like giving Chun a rusty gun made him The Devil Cop! Why are you so sure that Chun was innocent? His Shoelaces weren't tied the same way. The left shoe was tied in reverse. After switching the guns, the killer saw Chun's shoe had slipped. So he did one more thing: He put it back on Chun and tied it with the Ian Knot. I looked at all of Chun's photos. He never used that knot! (GPS off?) He's offline. Last seen on North Bridge. I'm OCTB Superintendent Auyeung... Turn the volume up... - all the way up! - Actually, I'm the Butcher... I'm the Devil Cop... I moved the corpses - Waves... ship horn... - and framed Keung. I killed him during the arrest... And heavy machinery noises. In the alleyway in Kwun Tong... Tai Kei Leng nullah! You've been here a million times, why would there be a miracle now? I'm that college student. I fled East Village when Fong saved me. I have the victim at Tai Kei Leng nullah! Between the two villages! Miss! I'm a police officer! The Butcher tortured me for three days. I really thought I was going to die... Can I see your scars? Any more? Scars covered by clothing... A sign of domestic abuse. It must've been violent... ...and insidious. Dual personalities: One male, one female. The Butcher took the pain he received from his loved ones and copied it onto you. Fong's a good man. He didn't mind my scars. He visited me after work every day to help me remember what happened. I want to find the bastard's hideout. What do you remember? He hit me especially hard on the third day. I felt he was going to kill me... But he suddenly got a call. I told myself, I can't die here. I picked up a tile and kept grinding the rope... I have to remember the path. I have to get him! Sounds of water on both sides and a bridge at the front door. On the 29th step down, I heard pinwheels. A turn, then another 38 steps down. There's a narrow staircase further down. Lots of tiny shelled nuts on the ground. Why didn't he kill you? What was the call about? Who called him? (Ian knot) Who tied your Shoelaces?! Fong did. I have the victim at Tai Kei Leng nullah! Between the two villages! Miss! I'm a police officer. He turned you around by 180 degrees. Can you tell me what happened? What's going on, Fong? She came from East Village. The perp's hideout must be there. Sweep the East Village completely! You came from West Village, not East! He fooled the police. I'm awesome, finding Devil Cop in the Butcher Case... Jun! Dispatch called and ordered everyone to search Tai Keng Leng Village. I was on patrol here. Then I saw you come down from East Village. Narrow staircase, small nuts on the ground. Small nuts on the ground! Narrow staircase! 10, 11, 12, 13... 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, then the turn... Pinwheels! Turn left... 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... Sounds of water left and right... A small bridge at the front door... My red scarf! Sounds of water on both sides and a bridge at the front door! Patty Wong... Hilary Yeung... Lily Chiu... Bowie Cheung... Chow Lok-yee... He killed so many women... Wylie Au... May Lau... Chung Lai-fong... Chiang Chun-chun... Cindy Choi... Moon Ho... Keung didn't kill anyone! Don't frame Keung! Keung didn't kill no one! Stay away! Put the kid down first! Didn't kill no one... Put the kid down! The 25 dead women are all here. This is the real Butcher's hideout! You got Keung killed! The Butcher is The Devil Cop! The Devil Cop is The Butcher! That call was from Dispatch! Hello? Fong! The college girl's phone was detected at Tai Kei Leng. All leaves are canceled. Sweep Tai Kei Leng Village. He let you go on purpose. He turned the cops to East Village so he could get away. Shit, I fell for it. He led me here so my prints would be everywhere. And he scattered cigars I've smoked. He tied your Shoelaces to draw me here. He led me here to frame me! How evil, how chilling... Just like that demon 20 years ago... He's a demon, too. Jun! Fong's the Butcher and Devil Cop! We gotta expose him! Fong can't be both Butcher and Devil Cop. Is it a mistake? Does he have scars all over, covered by clothes? He was abused by his family as a child! One is a woman, his mother! She was an alcoholic who sliced him with a cutter when she's drunk. Just like Mom, his older brother beat him with a hammer. Fong's been abused, too. That's why he understands me... Are they both dead? His mother was robbed and killed by a junkie when he was 16. Then his brother was killed in a hit and run... Killed his mother and pinned it on a junkie! And no one expects a 16-year-old to steal a car to kill his brother! You really are a nut. OCTB will arrest you! It looks more like your hideout. Your prints and cigars are in there! You keep saying you're the Chosen, now her husband's got you by the balls. You've stepped in shit and you don't even know where Auyeung is. (Unified Dockyard) This isn't the car that you drove yesterday. Whose is it? Your husband's! Why would her husband keep visiting an abandoned dockyard? Your daughter's about to kill Auyeung, forget it. Just get there first! Sir, your car's GPS is on again! They're on Dockyard Road. Unified Dockyard! Call in SWAT. Call the Ops Commissioner for approval! This is Fong from OCTB. We believe that Auyeung is being held at Unified Dockyards. We need SWAT deployed ASAP. Lil' Dee! Ma! Cat! Chau! Cream! Snake! Take these to the afterlife! You won't die in vain, brothers! I'm sorry, Dad! You'd been wronged for so many years! Dad, the world now knows you're not The Devil Cop! I'll kill Auyeung right now as tribute to you! Are you all disobeying orders? I told you on the phone! My dad said Auyeung isn't the Butcher! Shouldn't we stop and clear things up? The bastard had the girls' school uniforms! We found 25 dresses in his home! Ain't that clear enough? When you lead an operation, Jun shows up. Are you two in cahoots?! If it wasn't for that nut, our guys wouldn't have died! How can there be no mole?! Is your dad God or something?! He is! His ability isn't news to you. You've known this all along. Now you're doubting his talents? You call him a nut? You fire at him?! How could you get revenge without him?! "The Sleuths" are there. Your husband knows "The Sleuths" are here. How would her husband know? Forget it, find Auyeung first! In Butcher's hideout, we found 25 sets of bones, the securities firm cash box... Jun Lee's old warrant card, Cohina cigar butts... That was Jun's brand. I suspect that Jun has Multiple Personality Disorder. He has at least three personalities inside him. The righteous "Chosen Sleuth"... Why did you turn this bad?! The Butcher... As the Butcher... He knew Yee was the survivor all this time. He found her, groomed her to be a "Sleuth". He's also The Devil Cop. That's why he knew 17 years ago that Chun was framed... ...and the fourth man on the scene. There was a fourth person on the scene! It was a setup! The sleuth personality wanted to prove himself, but then Auyeung and I shot him. So his Butcher and Devil Cop set up Auyeung as a target. His next targets are you and me. Auyeung's here. Cover me. That nut's down there! Your dad even found us here? You're the mole! Call Yan. Tell her that Fong's The Butcher and Devil Cop! I'm Auyueng from OCTB... I'm really The Butcher... The Devil Cop... Stop losing your shit! This is serious. Tell Yan to stop posing. No one believes me, so you have to make it out. Don't die! Make it out alive, don't die... Don't kill Auyeung! I was wrong! I misled you all by saying that Auyeung is fishy. His partner, Fong, is the fishy one! He's both Devil Cop and Butcher! Lai! He led Auyeung to East Village. He buried the bodies to frame your dad and made Auyeung shoot him. Chu! He made Auyeung tell Yan that your dad's the Devil Cop. He knows that you're here! He's definitely called SWAT. Don't kill Auyeung. Surrender! It's not too late! Trust me, OK?! No one believes me, they've become demons! I'll kill you all! The three of you killed our friends! I'll kill you all! My water broke... We have to get revenge for our friends! I'm here to save you, wake up! You three ruined our plan! The hostage is SP Auyeung. Jun and Lynn Lee, Chu, Yeung and Yee are the prime suspects. Yee is 32 weeks pregnant. Our mission is rescue and arrest. Yes, sir! SWAT's here! Fire! "The Sleuths" have explosives! SWAT will shoot to kill! "Crows" have IEDs! Shoot to kill! Yee's pregnant... They're terrorists! All units! Shoot to kill! Multi targets, 300 meters! 12 o'clock! Target, 200 meters, 12 o'clock! They fell for the trap! Fong knows this hideout because he's a "Sleuth". He saw my notes under the bridge. I was close to solving both cases. He was scared and excited. He made Lynn a "Sleuth" and laid a trap at the shack to make me Butcher, Devil Cop and the "Sleuth". He framed me for his crimes, but he didn't expect me to meet you. I was close to exposing him, but the fear excited him more. He decided to risk it all. He tied your Shoelaces, led me to the docks, got SWAT to kill everyone! After tonight, either I'll be the "Chosen Sleuth" and he the psychopath, or he'll be the "Sleuth", and I'll be the psychopath! You really are insane! Fong is the kindest, most righteous... The wolf loves sheep's clothing! The devil loves to play the angel! Fong really is a "Sleuth". He's our leader. Where's Auyeung? He fled on a boat, but we blew him up. What about Jun, Lynn and my wife? They're in that old boat. And our guys? SWAT scattered them. I didn't think Jun would get so close. Find our guys and fight your way out. How did you know where Butcher's hideout is? Your stuff was all over the place. You're most likely the Butcher! Even if Fong is the "Sleuth", it's because he loves me. He loves you? Snap out of it! Psychopaths have no empathy or any shred of love! He married you so that he can see you every morning and remember how he killed those women! Auyeung's dead. You're the sole survivor. The last hope. Which one of us is The Butcher? Use your brain, West Kowloon Sleuth! Dad, the baby's shoulders are stuck! Prop the baby's head up. Push! You've done great the past two days. It's Jun's fault that we're being raided. But for our guys' sake, we can't give up! I've taught you how to fight SWAT. This is our turf, we still have a chance. Each of you take a grenade. If you're cornered... use it to help the others escape. Regardless of who gets out, I'm proud of you all. Remember... We're "The Chosen Sleuths"! Crows are sinking the dock! SWAT, retreat! Boat team, attack! I'll stay, go find your little brother. Help, Brother! I don't want to die! Help me, Brother! Run, Little Brother! Farewell, my friends! Jun, you bastard! You monster! Couldn't get away after all... Getting revenge... ...for Dad... ...was worth it... Boss... Did you kill Jun Lee? I'm The Devil Cop. I'm The Butcher. Papa! Papa... Join the police when you grow up. We'll catch the real killer together. Chai Ka-chu reporting for duty! The wife did it. Arrest her! Yes, sir! Yeung Lai. Her father was Keung. Auyeung tied his Shoelaces with the Ian Knot. But he changed it after he shot Jun at the press con. Jun's really the Chosen Sleuth. He knew that Auyeung's Devil Cop and Butcher. The bastard tortured my wife! Lau killed 21 women, but we can't charge him because he has Parkinson's. These three killed for inheritance! These gangsters killed a whole family! Over 100 cold cases here, and Jun solved them all! The answers are all here, but no one cares! We have to get justice and show the world that Jun is the Chosen Sleuth. Jun has a daughter. She thinks her father's a nut. She's a real rebel. Do you hate cops because you hate your dad... or do you hate cops because of how they treated him? He's a nut, not a cop, OK? Have you considered that he's not a nut? He's actually the Chosen Sleuth. He's solved many cold cases and botched investigations. No one believes him, but we do. You're his daughter. Lead us. Push! Dad, are we going to die? No! I just got my daughter back. If I live through this, I'll expose Fong. I don't want this to be another botched case. Good! I'll tell the whole world how Fong taught Chu, Lai and I... to line up the families of cold case victims. He trained us, armed us, taught us to brainwash them and drive them to kill. Dad... I'm proud of you. Good. Come out! Come out, little baby! Come out, little baby! It's coming... Come on, kid. Run! Let's go! You nut! You're a genius who wasted your life! Let me give you the death you deserve! After tonight, you'll become me, and I'll be you! You'll be the psychopath, and me the Chosen Sleuth! You want to be me, but I don't want to be you! Your mom turned you into a demon! For your son, become human again! Surrender! It's not too late! How can you kill your son?! Jun, let's swap! I'll kill your daughter, and you kill my son! You'll die soon, too, psychopath! Known by all as a wicked criminal. Aren't you mad that you ended up like this? If you can't kill me, kill my son. Otherwise, you won't get your revenge! Kill the kid, and you become a demon! Everyone can become a demon! Why not me?! I'm human, too. If he can kill my daughter, then I can kill his son! It's because of her that you can't become a demon. She's proud of you! Dad... I'm proud of you. I'm sorry... Must be painful to see your daughter killed. I'd like to know if I'd be in pain if my son dies. You can't even do me a simple favor?! You really are nuts. Farewell, Sleuth! Fong! You're The Butcher, The Devil Cop, "The Sleuths"! You're also my husband and our baby's father! Turn yourself in! Why don't you ask me if my love for you is for real? Don't you want to know if I've ever loved you? I did! Very much! You're my proudest work! If you hadn't met that nut and nearly exposed me, I wouldn't have the heart to kill you. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Madam! It's SP Auyeung! I have to make it... I can't die... Auyeung! Jun Lee saved me. Fong is The Butcher... The Devil Cop... He fed me the clues to the two cases... I met him while investigating his mom and brother's deaths. Come to think of it, their deaths seemed fishy, too. Play that footage again! Zoom into the right hand. Show me Jun's arrest! Jun's bandage was on his left hand. Fong's is on his right. That murderer is Fong! Call in the Flying Service for backup! Did you see it? See what? The demon! I did. CIP Yee Chan, reporting for duty. Where's your partner? I offered a ride, but he said he has his own. OCTB Investigative Consultant, Jun Lee. Be humble when we're on a case. The perps in OCTB's cases aren't human, they're demons! When one thinks of himself as "chosen", those demons mock us. We're not "chosen", we're just Sleuths. We just need to... do our best. And ask ourselves if there's any stone left unturned. Remember! There is no Chosen Sleuth among us. Understand?! Yes, sir! The people of Hong Kong are counting on us! - No more ballgames! - Detective Lee... - No dates! - Your room is this way... No Karaoke! - Park Detective Lee's ride. - No gaming! No mahjong! No friends! No going home! No seeing family! No TV! Here's your seat, Detective. - Help yourself. - No movies! We're going back to work. (Teen captures mother's murderer) "Whoever battles monsters" "should ensure that he does not become one."
