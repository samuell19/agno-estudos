The Last Snows Of Spring Papa, I'm sorry I won't see you anymore. Hey Luca, you really going to Japan for Easter vacation? Sure. Why not? My grandmother wants me to learn karate. I bet you're going to somewhere really good, huh? Sure, my grandmother's. You know, Sardinia, like last year. See ya. Bye. Bye. You know the trouble with Carlo? He's such a snob. I bet if he didn't know that I was your friend he wouldn't say goodbye at all. What kind of car your father got? A Mercedes. I guess you'll see it when he comes to get me. It's a white one. I think I'll just die if my father comes to take me home. What's the problem? I like mommy better because she knows how to cook. All Papa does is Kung-Fu. I love mommy's cheesecake best. Oh, I knew it. Papa, what a drag. We'll see each other tomorrow. See ya. Hi Luca. Do I get a kiss? But where's Papa? He said he was gonna come. He couldn't make it. You know how much he works. Yeah, Yeah. I know. It's only for a little while. You like the style the car? Beautiful, No? You want to help drive? Great! But put it in gear first, straight on. How is school? All right, I guess. You know. No women around. Kind of gets to a guy after a while. Well let's see you shut up for months like that. You mean you see no women at all? Nothing to write home about. Unless you count... Yeah, the new organist she's okay. Get me an introduction? Ehhh What kind of cook was my mother? Not a good cook. She had to look up how to make a hardboiled egg. But your father didn't mind. They loved each other a lot. Bernardo, where is the best place to go to become an expert in karate? Why don't you try a gym? Where do you want to go for Easter? The sea? Sardinia. A friend of mine goes there all the time. And he has been kidnapped 4 times! Eh! Four times already! Yes. That's why I want to learn karate. Ya! Ya! I'll kill all of them. Bernardo, can we stop here a moment? I have to get a present to take home to Papa. Fine by me. How about this one? Let's find what you want. Anything among these? These are marvelous colors. No, huh? Let's try something else. Do you like it? That's the one This one. How much is it? 12 thousand lira for the set. Without the scarf? Eight thousand. I'll just take the tie. Thank you, sir. I've changed my mind. I think I'll? Oh, no. I want to buy him something that's really... I don't know. I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll buy it off you. Okay. No, but I'll give it to you. But you have to lend me some money? But where are you going? I'll take this one! Thanks. You want it gift wrapped? Yes, can I write something on it first. Take it. "To Papa with lots of love, Luca" You forgot to take me by the showroom to let me examine a Ferrari. Very well. A Ferrari. Did father say when he will be back? No. Just that he will be late. You better go to bed. No, I'll wait up for him. It won't be the first time. Bye. Bye. Hello, please, has the lawyer returned? He hasn't called in? No, it's not important. Just a friend of his... Luca. Hello. Angelina, is my father up yet? He left an hour ago for the Courthouse. How come he didn't say hello before he left? He didn't want to wake you. Now eat your breakfast. But I wanted to see him. And you knew it! You can see him at lunch, Luca. I want to go order stuff at Stefan?a's. Luca, wait till you finish breakfast. Are you sure your father won't be angry? Don't be silly? He told me to meet him at the Courthouse. Come on! Come on! Wait for me! Hey, wait for me. Take your sandals off. Wait for me! He's a murderer. How do you know? I just do, that's all. My father's a lawyer. Where are you supposed to meet him? Don't worry. Let's sit down here. He'll come. Papa. Luca, what are you doing here? I'll be right in. I wanted to see you. Why didn't you pick me up at the school? Didn't Bernardo get there alright? Now Luca, what's so urgent. I just wanted to see you. So we could talk about what to do for Easter. Can't you see how busy I am. Santi, you've been called. I'll be right there. Listen, I must run Luca. I'll see you tonight after dinner. At the house. You can't trust him! He's just like my father. What do you mean? I think he's awful! You shouldn't talk like that about my father. Will you quit changing it? I can't hear myself read. Why do you read that junk anyway? Because at home I can't, Papa won't let me. My father never tells me what to do. You know for Christmas we're heading on safari in Africa? What's a safari? A tiger hunt in Africa. In Africa there are no tigers. It makes no sense. The women are naked but the men never are? In Africa? No, in the magazines. Sure it's for men only. That's why. No, I took this from my mother. I mean I snuck this under my sweater the last time we had lunch together. She didn't even notice? No, she's got hundreds. Hey look. Mommy's like this one. But her boobs sag a little more. Pretty huh? What's your mother like? Papa says she's bitchy. Last time he bought her something. Do you have something to eat? Go in the kitchen and look in the fridge. Luca, my mother's always afraid of getting fat. Well shouldn't you be worried about that as well? Oh, no. I'm fat already. You know my father is alright really. Yesterday he gave me a tie. Today he was just busy, that's all. He always gives me lots of presents. Records, clothes. Do your parents holler and hit each other for real? I don't know. She usually laughs and he is so serious. They usually wait until I go to bed so I can't hear. Hey what you do. The whole can of tuna is finished. So it wasn't much. Wow that's 8:00. I'm late! I'll come over again tomorrow, okay? No wait. Can't you stay any longer? You?re kidding. And I'm hungry. She's a hog! She could have left me some of that tuna. My mommy was pretty. Hey, you're not my mommy? Hey I don't even know you. I've never seen you in my life. Of course you are not hungry this morning Luca. There's a whole can of tuna missing from the fridge. How many times do I have to tell you about eating between meals. You understand Luca? Hmm. Let me. I want to take it upstairs. Don't pull child. You'll drop it! I will if you don't let go. Papa... Papa. Hello... how are you? Okay You were asleep when I came in. What did you do yesterday? I was playing all day with Stefan?a. Papa, you smell like whiskey and tobacco. I do? It won't be too long before you smell like tobacco, and whiskey. You'll see. Oh no. Why not? Because when I grow up I'm only going to drink vodka. It tastes better. It tastes sweet. Very well. Good vodka. You really know what's good, huh. Can we have lunch together? Sorry Luca I can't. I have to go to Rome to see a client. It's very important. I'll have lunch with him. Hey, why the long face? We are going to the sea in a few days, remember. Then we'll have plenty of time to spend together. Lunch with him and then dinner with me. Ah please. Once we're back in school we won't see each other for months. But I always come to see you there. You just think it's always. Just twice you came last term. And Bernardo came four times, five times. Hey, look here... Aw say yes. Aw come on Papa please ... Say yes. Please Papa. Okay, at 8:30 you be ready and waiting for me. Now get out of here you little rascal. Here's one! Papa?s gonna take me on an airplane to Japan. I'm sorry about tonight. But I promised Luca. Poor Luca, stuck with a father like you! Oh I don't know. I don't think he has so much to complain about. He has friends, he likes school. There are lots of kids worse off than he is. Of course it would be better if there was someone at home who could spend more time with him. So that's why you want to get married. Hey that's a clever idea how'd you guess. The truth is he doesn't see enough of me. He's not the only one now that you mention it. Well you are doing alright today. We can meet here, I'll pick you up at 4:30? On the dot. Alright. Women. Once upon a time they'd do anything to get that ring on their finger. But not any longer. At least not Veronica. I love her. We get along. Isn't that enough. Not now. What more does she want. Of course if they could have me mooning over them 24 hours a day. Why won't he understand? It's not so simple to become a mother of a ten year old boy. How do I know if Luca will like me or not. At that age a child's perceptions are pretty well set. How stupid we are always trying to find some justification for being together. All she has to do is look in the mirror after we've made love. And see her as I see her. Shattered, defenseless, totally happy. Without all the stuff that happens during the day. What makes me mad is that I know he could change. The more I reason with him the more stubborn he gets. Stubborn! Only when I make love do I really feel close to him. Thanks for minding the car. You can take care of it tomorrow sir. What the hell happened to you! I'm sorry. I got tied up. Ah yes, sorry, always the same story. You left me here standing in the sun for an hour! What a day! Anyway Grosetti was acquitted even though it was pretty close. Damn Grosetti! For pity's sake. You keep me waiting for an hour. Then all you can do is talk about your work! My god! I've been rushing about all day and now you attack me? Do I always have to be on time to say I love you, I love you? No. Not always. But sometimes, yes. What do you want? The fucking moon? I no longer know what to do. You complain. Luca complains. What the hell am I suppose to do? Do what everyone else does. Organize your time a little better. Surely the others aren't important to us. Additionally imagine. This month I'm suppose to take Luca to the beach. Forget it. And Luca matters. Well youngster What would you like now. Guess. A fancy ice cream? No. A watermelon. You want a clue. What did we talked about this morning, remember? No what? I told you I would never smell of whiskey in the morning because I prefer vodka. Can I have a vodka, please? But you'll be sick after the wine. Oh please Papa. Okay. But a little glass. You agree? Waiter... a large vodka and a small whiskey. Yes sir. Thank you. Listen, Luca, I'd like to talk to you? man to man. About the vacation.... my god.. I'm not here. You see that man sitting over there, if he comes over tell him you are with somebody else. Luca... how are you? Are you with your father? No Well, didn't I hear something? No, what. I'll see him tomorrow in the office. Bye Luca. Is he gone? Yes. Good, are you sure? He's gone, Papa. What was I saying? Ah, yes, about the vacation. I'm afraid you would be bored with only me. No way. You know I won't be bored. It's just that... You know I want to be alone with you. A large vodka and a small whiskey. To us. Cheers. You know something? I don't think mommy would give me any vodka. Waiter, the check please. Yes, the check Thank you We're here. Now go straight to bed. I'll see you in the morning. Goodbye Papa. Good night! Good night! I couldn't find the right words! And you call yourself a lawyer? What do you mean? I thought a lawyer was never lost for the right words. Ver?nica, why don't we go away for a week. I can tell him I had to go abroad on business. No Roberto, I could never forgive myself. And neither could you. Sometimes we have to be humane. Your son only has a short vacation. So the best solution is we go away together. No. Why no? It's not right. Look at it from Luca's point of view. He wants to spend his vacation with you. And he'll think I'm trying to steal you. Are you ready. Bye! It's a lot of fun trying to be Luca's father. And how do you tell a boy that instead of two there will be three because of you? With children you have to make a clear case. You have to be sure about that. Reasons or not, you are coming with us. My god. I have to telephone Georgio about that case tomorrow. I'm fed up with your work. For once let's not bring up work and let's not change the subject. Okay I'll talk to Luca and if he agrees we will all three go away together. Do you agree? Eh, let's go pussycat we've arrived. Out you get. Goodnight. Why don't you stay with me? You can spend the night. Okay Really Luca, you have turned the whole room upside down. Papa is waiting for me. You'll be the death of me yet. If you had done your packing last night you wouldn't be in such a row, and what are you going to do with 3 suitcases of clothes at the sea. I want to look my very best with Papa. But you are only staying a few days! Ready Luca? Papa Hurry up, which suitcase is yours? I'll take it. All three. Three suitcases, are you crazy? There's not enough room, and we are not going alone. What do you mean we are not going alone? I mean someone else is coming with us. It's a lady so we have to be on our best behavior. She's coming with us? That's right. She is a friend. Is he all ready? Yes. Get it all into one suitcase. Someone I never met? You will get to know her very soon. Her name is Veronica. A couple more hours and we are there. You normally expect more traffic this time of year. Luca, do you want to get a drink? That's a good idea. There's a bar at the next exit. Luca is probably dying for a soda. Right? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue. "I know you are my father's friend." Come on, Luca, shake it up. Good afternoon. Hello. Have a good trip down? Yes. What a lovely day. Couldn't pick a better one. Good day sir. Welcome Would you bring in the bags please? Yes sir. This place is like paradise Nice place you got here. Are you tired? Just a little. Would you like a drink? Thanks. Mineral water. Here. Thanks. That's me. Just after I graduated from law school. Where do I put the suitcases? Put those three in the bedroom in the back. Those two upstairs. Very good sir. Please leave mine there a minute. Yes. Roberto, I'd prefer to stay in a hotel. Why? The room upstairs is yours. Yes but this way you and Luca will be alone more. And I will feel more independent. Let's talk this over. Luca. Would you do me a favor and take my bags back to the car. What are you up too? Luca understood how things are with us. Oh yes I'm sure of that! But I bet a dime to a dollar that you didn't talk to him. I throw truth out the window if I stay here a night. I'm not happy about it either but what can I do? But that's not the same at all. I know it isn't. Will I see you tonight? Another day. Okay, let's go. Papa, can I help you unpack your suitcases? No, I can take care of it myself. Papa you're not happy to be here at all, are you? Of course I am. Hi Luca, you coming to the beach? Where's Papa? I'm afraid your Papa is has work to do. When I left he was on the phone to Perugia. He'll try to come down in an hour or so. I found your message, Luca. I don't know what to tell you? I don't like the situation any more than you do. And coming down here together wasn't my idea. But if you give me a chance we could be friends. Why don't you give it a try, eh? Hey do you have a place of your own? Not a home, a secret place. You are the only one who knows about it, but promise not to tell my father. No. Cross my heart. I promise. I'm good at finding hiding place. Don't you think so? Yes. Do you have any kids? No, but I'd like to. Boy if I ever had any kids I sure won't send them to boarding school. It get's lonely, doesn't it? Well, you know. Hey, see how high it is? Yeah, I hope there aren't any bats in here. What's that up there? Another way in? Yes. You want to climb up. Luca, this is far enough. No there is another way out down there. See the light? Ah. Careful, you will make me fall. You know I'd be scared to come down here alone? Sure. That's because you're a girl. It's pretty here. You like my hiding place, it's nice? Sure. But it is a little cold isn't it. Shall we go? Okay. Let's run. Steer to the right. No. No. Now left. Not too much or we go into the sea. It wouldn't have broken if you'd been driving. You got the spark plug wet. Hey wait a minute. You were the one who said it wasn't too deep. Remember? Hey come on. Shake it up huh. Let's go. We got to rinse off your face. You have soap in the nose... Turn around. You're on the phone for the entire vacation; I see you more in Perugia than here. What's wrong? I'm sorry, Ver?nica. Are you going to tell me what's wrong? I'm just wasting my time. Here I come. Look out! Hey Papa, why don't we live here all year. I've already told you Luca, besides you know where I work. Oh sure. You and your work, and me and my school. Can I ride into town a little? I don't think that's a good idea. There's not much traffic this way. And he's old enough now. Okay, but don't be too late, understand? Okay, I won't. Hello. Come here. Hey, Come on. Let's see a smile. What's the matter? Smile. What's the matter? You aren't scared of elephants. I'll see they won't hurt you. Come over here. Good, eh? Slowly that's cold. Take it easy. Slowly. Give me the bottle. Eh, no, that's mine. We are leaving tomorrow. What? Yes, we are leaving tomorrow. When? We are leaving tomorrow morning. But we only arrived three days ago. I'm afraid that for this year, that you and Luca have to be satisfied. This is a big case. And you cannot postpone it? I tried but... You're an egotist! Ver?nica. You planned this. Don't do this Roberto, let me go. We'll have plenty of other vacations. Just the two of us. Don't get mad. Give me a kiss. Who's outside there? What? Didn't you hear anything? No, it must have been the wind. Don't worry darling. You know what kids are like. He probably met some friends and went off to play. Don't worry? You must be kidding? Look at how dark it is. And listen to that wind! Yeah. Thank you. Yes, I'll be waiting here. Well? The police haven't found him. Maybe I know where he is. Where are you going? Luca, I know you are in here. Luca, why don't you answer me? Luca, what's happened to you? Are you angry with me? Have I done something wrong? I didn't ask you to come here. Go back to my father. I'm listening, Luca. What did I do? You know very well. Alright I suppose you saw your father and me kissing. Is it a crime to kiss? I don't see anything wrong? Is it me? Don't you want to... If you don't want to see me anymore, I can arrange it. Luca, look at me when I talk to you, I'm not finished yet. If I'm not your friend then why didn't I tell your father about this place. Your father is worried sick about you. He's even got the police looking for you. Your father loves you. Why don't we return together? You'll see that it won't be held against you. Let's go, Luca, come on. Or perhaps you'd rather stay up there and cry? It's stuck, I can't. Brake. When you must break, you must break. My legs couldn't reach the brakes. Test it a little. Ready the clutch. Slowly, slowly. Ah, maybe I'd better drive. Yes, this car is a piece of junk. Why are you so down in the mouth? Out with it, I'm listening. Nothing, nothing really. How's Ver?nica? You know her? Sure, how do you like her? She's friendly. She's been sort of nice to me, I guess. But my mother was much prettier, right? Yes, quite beautiful. Hey, stop a minute. Look, an amusement park. Wow, swings too! It's terrific! It's got everything! It looks closed. Please Bernardo, let's ask if it's open. Alright. Excuse me, is it open yet? No, we are just setting up. Not even the bumper cars? No, we have no current. It will be a couple of days yet. I'll certainly return then. Will you bring me? Sure I'd love to take you. Listen, why don't you ask your father? No, I want to go with you. Luca, you've been sulking. Ever since you returned from the beach. I have? Yes, and it's not right Luca. What has your father done that's so bad? He loves you very much. He doesn't. It hurts him when you are like this. He doesn't even notice. You may think he doesn't. It hurts him deeply. Listen Luca, when a man has something on his mind that needs to be said, he says it. Why don't you talk to him? Why? He won't understand. How do you know? Maybe he won't. You must give him a chance to defend himself, no? Seems only fair. No. It doesn't even matter now. I go back to school in four days. What happens in the next three days? Are you afraid? Me, afraid? No, it seems that way to me. Very well, tomorrow, I will talk to him. Hey, a ferris wheel going up. Bet you can hardly wait. You know when mommy goes out at night, the man who takes her out nearly always kisses her. I just think you are being lucky. Yes, no, it's really not important to me. Why are you putting cheese on top of jam? Otherwise it's too sweet. Besides your father is a man. Why is that different? Men have many girlfriends. So you're father has girlfriends? I don't think so. He probably gets bored! More jam? Yes, now it tastes of too much cheese. I guess Matilde is the only one. Who is Matilde? She was my mother's friend but now she comes to see pap?. Anyway she is kind of dull too. Sometimes she holds his hand and they just sit there. They eat, talk of music, later pap? takes her hand and she blows. She blows? With the nose. As if one blows one's nose but it's all full of passion. What's that in there? Anchovy paste. Why are you getting dressed up? It must be something pretty important. I have to have a serious talk with my father. We'll be talking man to man. Baa, maybe it needs a little mayonnaise. Hello Papa. You know I have been with Bernardo. When? Yesterday? Where did you go? Very well. Let me guess. I am certain you have talked to Bernardo about Ver?nica. And you had talked a lot on that day. Have you been told this is a game? No Papa. But the truth has been explained badly to you. Do you believe Bernardo or me? You. Then come here. It's not possible to live alone. I see. You are a friend of Stefanela? Yes. Good. You are a little friendly with Ver?nica? Yes. For me, Ver?nica is a little more than a friend. So then This has nothing to do with you being my son. Nobody can take your place. The love I have for you is something special. Papa. When you are older you will understand that a man always needs a woman to share his life. It helps that is. You like Veronica. I don't have anything against Ver?nica. I'm only scared of not seeing you anymore. I will always love you. Will you always love me? Suppose I marry Ver?nica in which case you will always be with us. You won't have to think about boarding school. Seriously, pap?. Wouldn't you like that? Say Luca, I have an idea. When must you return to school? On Monday. What if you returned a week late? Why? Because I thought we could spend a week in the mountains. Just you and me Papa? Just us, alone. You sure took your time! I thought you were a good skier, huh. At least I didn't fall. I fell because I felt dizzy. Maybe you were looking at the girls. Tell me, has this happened to you before? No I didn't have breakfast that must be it. Aha, late night. Too much vodka. Shall we go down! Papa. What is it? Papa? What's happening? Time to get up. What time is it? Ten minutes to seven. We were going to have a sled race. Remember? It's too early. You know how it is. Later it's full of people. Listen. Why don't you go out and practice. I'll join you in an hour or so. Okay. But I'll try the cable car. Sleepyhead. Hey. Can you tell me what time it is? It's around 8:30. When do they start up the chair lift? About nine I guess. I want to practice with the sled. It's pretty dangerous at this hour. I want to practice on the track. I want to race using the sled. The tracks are still icy, it's dangerous. But later the skiers won't let me race using the sled. Wait a little bit. Here they all sleep in until after ten. Are you alright? Bleeding? Yes, my nose is bleeding. That's nothing. It often happens at this altitude. It happens to me in school. Let me have a look. It's stopped already. Like I said it's nothing. We aren't equipped for the type of tests he needs. We'll do everything that is necessary today. Get him checked over as soon as you get him home. What happened? Nothing. You fell off because you hit a sheet of ice. Is the sled broken? Now try to get a little sleep. You need rest. But I'm okay. Papa, I didn't come here to rest. Come on, Luca. Just a short while. I want to ski. Later. When you are rested. Okay? Lawyer, I'll be in my office outside. Perhaps you are right. I am a little tired. Then rest. I'll be right back. Well? I just got the test results. I must be honest with you. What's it say. In the blood analysis were leukocytes of medullary origin... For God's sake. Tell me what's wrong with my son. He has Medullary Acute Leukemia. Leukemia. Impossible. Doctor... Unfortunately there is no known cure. However recently the Americans developed a new drug. Be clear lawyer, it's only a chance. The drug is in the experimental stage. But the results so far have been excellent. It is a very delicate treatment and we still do not know it?s true effectiveness. However at this point it's his only chance. Hello. Hello. How is he? He is asleep. You look worn out. Go on, sit down. He asked me to tell him a fairytale. But he can't concentrate very long. It's like he was little again. He has been delirious much of today. He asked me for his mother. Did he lose blood? No. Good. Go back to the house. Okay. I'll stay with him. We'll see each other later. Goodbye. Goodbye. Papa I want to... ask you so many things. Ask. Is it sunny outside? Yes. It must be a beautiful day. I'd like to go outside. When you get better. I won't get better Papa. I've never felt this bad. Not even with chickenpox. What are you talking about? Of course you'll get better. And soon too. I don't think so. Why do you say that? I feel very badly. I feel like I am floating, all I see are shadows, lots of shadows. Nothing is real. I read in a book once. That's what it's like to die. Papa, I'm so scared. Luca. No, he's only fainted. It's better if you let him rest. Are you ready? Yes, I'm free. Listen Luca was asking for you. Aren't you gonna come and visit. I should. But I can't bear to see him like that. I'm not strong like you, Roberto. The tragedy is that he finally gets what he always wanted. What are you talking about? Forget it Roberto. It's too late to go into it now. Go on, say it. Children do sometimes need attention, you know. But you ignored him completely. Sure you are suffering now. But how much did you make him suffer? You only thought about your clients. And how many women did you have. Before Veronica? You always had time for them to. But you never had time for Luca. In the last year you only went to see him twice. And I had to insist. What have I done with my life. Nothing. Hello. Hello. What are those tubes doing up your nose? It's for oxygen. That's what my mother's goldfish breathe. By the way my parents are back together. That's good. Eek. I could just about take it when they lived in separate houses. You know the exam we had last term? The professor said your subject was beautiful. You got an "A" for it. An "A"? If you ask me it's only because you are sick. Did you bring a sandwich or anything? No, because I made a promise not to snack until your better. Better be soon, I am dying of hunger. How do you do it. It's very difficult. I have to go now because I have a lot of homework. You?re lucky you don't have to go to school. Bye. I'll come back next Monday. Roberto, you shouldn't give up hope yet. You heard what the doctor said about the new analysis. It worked in other cases so why shouldn?t it be effective now. You should go home. No. I'll stay. Try not to get too depressed. If there's anything new will you give me a call. Yes. The results are conclusive. He's not responding to treatment Papa, I feel much better. See. I'm hungry. Papa, I wanted to ask you. But you are always working. Could you take me to the amusement park? Please. Take me please, Papa? Now? Yes, tonight. Why didn't you ask me before? There was no opportunity. You are always busy with your work. I understand, you know? The other day, with Bernardo, I bought you a record. But I was mad at you so I hid it in the attic. You can have it now. Forgive me, Luca. Don't cry Papa. The rides look all closed. Don't worry. They shut down sometimes... because there are no people. Leave it to me. You'll see how Papa makes it work. Excuse me. Who's the man in charge? He is. You know something? These days, even though I feel bad I am happy because I'm with you. At school they used to tease me because you never came to visit me. They should see me now. I have the entire amusement park for myself. I am tired, Papa. Papa, will you hold my hand please. It's difficult to sleep. I know you won't leave me. I'm sorry I won't see you anymore. Please don't be sad.
