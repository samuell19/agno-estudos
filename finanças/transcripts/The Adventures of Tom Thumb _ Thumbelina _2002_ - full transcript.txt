In the heart of a magical forrest... ...there exists of kingdom of very small people. Most of them no better than your thumb. For many years they lived... ...happily far from the eyes of the outside world. Until one day... ...a man came to the forrest looking for... ...an usual creatures to display in his travelling circus. He discovered the peaceful kingdom and could imagine the crowds... ...that would pay to see his tiny new stars. He crapped into the village and stall two of the tiniest... ...inhabitants. A boy and a girl. Far outside the village the boy managed to escape. But the girl remained his prisoner. With no memory of her past... ...the girl grow into a tiny beautiful woman. Thumbelina! Thumbelina! Thumbelina, wake up! It's almost show time. Time to sparkle! One more show today. Then, you can sleep on your own time. Get a move on! Get a move on. Pinheads If you rejects put half as much energy... ...into the show as you do your downtime... ...you might be good for something. Easy, girl, just one more show tonight. Showtime! I wanna see a chipper bunch of rejects smiling ear-to-ear. Ladies and Gentlemen. Moppets of all ages! Roman's Carnival of Curiosity is proud... ...to present a Cavalcade of Comedy... ...a Totality of Tomfoolery not to mention reams of rejects! It's positively cumbersome! But I depress, presenting the world's tiniest child... ...six inches of fun... ...the little girl who stands the world on its rear... ...the one, the only, Thumbelina! Well, here we go again. Where did the little girl come from? Found her under a leaf. One of life's little accidents... ...freak of nature. Ladies and Gentlemen. Have you ever in your days, seen anything of this magnesium? Thumbelina the Magnificent! Doesn't she just burn your heart, ladies and gentlemen. No food for the chimp tonight! Look at that hand! Inflection could set in at any moment. Well, it could have been worse. Warwick could have made a snack of your elephantine proboscis. That's true, I think. You're growing up smart and I don't like smart. It irrigates me, you hear?! I hear you, you're irrigated. And Roman doesn't like to be irrigated! Who does? Especially by one of his little rejects. I'm a reject. There are other mice. There are other monkeys. There are even other pinheads. But there's only one like me. Only one me. Only one. I am all alone Always on my own There's nobody in this whole wide world For me to love Always by myself Stuck here on this shelf Is there someone in this whole wide world For me to love? For Thumbelina to love? And even though, I'm smart as this It happens I have lips to kiss A hand to hold A heart that breaks in two or maybe three Will someone ever Notice Me? I am all alone Always on my own Is there someone in this Whole wide world For me to love? For Thumbelina To love? There's no one anywhere in this world like me. No one. Let me have a wrench, will ya? Thanks, Ben. Come on. Can you fix it, Boy? Piece of... Alright, start her up! Ben, do you think I'm short for my age? That's hard to say, Tom? Since there's nothing to compare me to, you mean? Better to be an original than a copy. - What's that? - What's what? You always were a sucker for that one. Listen, always be prepared for any eventuality, kid. You tell him. I'm not gonna tell him. What about Muscles here? I just don't think my nerves could survive a confrontation. Oh, let's draw straws. Hey, loosen up there, will ya? I always lose this stupid game. Here comes Roman? What have we got here? Looks like a reject unemployment line. Which it could very well be very soon. You got something on your mind, Pinhead? What about you, Tiny? You thinking about anything besides your next meal? How about you, Brawn for Brains? Well, as a matter of fact, sir, we were just chatting and... Get to the point. Thumbelina has something to say to you. So, what have you got to tell me? We think... I think you should feed the monkey. There's a lot of thinking going on around here... ...and none of it wise. So Little Miss Ugly wants to feed the monkey. Well, maybe I'll feed him you. Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! Thanks for the ride, pal. This is the place... ...isn't it, Ben? Yep. This is where I found you, kid. It was after I first took the act on the road. I was camped for the night. Right where we find ourselves now. I had just nodded off when I heard a sound. At first, I thought I was dreaming... ...but the dogs they heard it, too. It was the sound of voices... ...hundreds of voices, tiny voices screaming. It chilled me clean through... ...one of the dogs saw something. They got good eyes, dogs do. Then, I saw it, too. Something was running towards me. Something small. Me? You weren't more than a toddler at the time I picked you up... ...and, well, you fell right asleep. Children will do that you know. Growing up, I always felt like I was the only one like me. But lately you've been feeling that there might be others? And that maybe... ...I don't know. There might be somebody special. I think that it may be time for you to strike out and... ...try to find that somebody. That's why I brought you here. You see, Tom. I'm going to be moving on soon, too. And where I'm going, well... ...you can't be coming with me. I've had some good years... ...and many of them. The best since I found you. But there comes a time when everybody's gotta move on. For you it's called growing up. For me... ...well... If you like the company of rodents and chimps, better than people... ...you can ride with them. No! No! Please, no! I can take everything away, kid. Even the light! No, I don't like the dark. I'm afraid. Go ahead. Tell her what you heard. When Roman was hitching up the horses... ...he told one of the drivers that we're near the place... ...where he found you years ago. He said there were others like you that night but... ...you were the only one he could catch because you were just a baby. There are others... ...others like me? I may be small but I am not going to be small here any longer. If there are others like me, then, then there's someplace I belong... ...and I can find it! Whoa! I think I can. I know I can! There are some clothes in there, some food... ...and a compass. That should be everything you need. I wish I knew how to thank you. You've been like a father to me, Ben. You don't have to thank me, kid. You've given me more than I ever... ...thought I'd have. I was wrong. You are my father. I love you Ben. That's a tear for good luck. Tom! Good-bye fellas. Better get a move on, boy. That was close. Watch it. I'm still back here, you know! It'll be okay. Don't look down. Don't look down, it'll be okay. Good Luck! We'll miss you! I'll miss you. It's freezing. Didn't anybody ever tell you that it's not polite to stare? Didn't anybody ever tell you that it's not polite to stare? I've never seen anything like it! It only has two arms! Well, it looks like pond sludge. Let's take it home to Mother. I saw it first! You thought it was pond sludge! Well, now that I look closer, I see that it's defective. No antenna. How can it feel without an antenna? We don't want something that can't feel. I can feel quite well, thank you very much! A Biped no less! You are talking about me as if I'm not even here! Stop it! - Touchy! - Touchy! Petulant, little thing! Let it be Bertha, it's not in our class. I am not an it! I'm a she! And she is leaving! Maybe with discipline, she could be house-trained? Could we stand to look at her... ...day after day, that's my question? She's so ugly. Let's see what Mummy thinks? Yes, let's let Mummy decide if we should keep her. I'm not going anywhere with you! It's not up to you or anybody to keep me. Not anymore. I'm on my own! With that attitude, you'll always be on your own! Get away! You don't belong here! - You don't belong anywhere! - You don't belong anywhere! - You don't belong anywhere! - You don't belong anywhere! Maybe they're right. What do you see, Godfrey, what do you see? The usual, Daniel, the usual. The usual insects, amphibians, indigenous plant life. Raccoon guano. A tiny girl floating in a sardine can. A tiny girl floating in a sardine can? What do you think, Godfrey what do you think? Me thinks the Boss shall soon be singing our praises. I love it when he sings. What do you say, Godfrey? What do you say? Should we tell him now? Good news. Like your reddish wines... ...should be allowed to age, Daniel. There's plenty of time to tell him. Tell him what? - Your Majesty! - Your Majesty! Who's speaking? It's your humble servant, Godfrey, your Majesty. Captain of the Guards. - And Daniel. Your Master of Hounds. You have news for me? - Excellent news! - Fantastic news! Unprecedented news! Glorious news! Out with it already! We've just seen the most beautiful creature in the forest. Stunning. Lovely! I've wanted a queen for a long time. A Kingdom isn't properly accessorized without one. This girl has got 'Queen' written all over her! Where, where, where is this divine creature? Are my chamber maids preparing her for an audience? You do have her don't you? You know, I don't like to be disappointed. It makes me disagreeable! And when I'm disagreeable, I wouldn't want to be you! She's on her way. Really. Very anxious to meet you, she is. Very anxious. She wanted to look her best. You know... She's... She's primping! Then, I must look my best as well. Where is my... I need my crown! The crown always impresses... Where is that maid? Yes, where is that maid? Gertrude! We're waiting! Beg pardon, sire, I was polishing your crown. I must share this news with my loyal subjects. Captain of the Guards! Summon my minions. Yes, your Majesty. All Moles assemble in the Throne Room. Immediately! Mergatroid, how good to see you. - Boris, looking swell. - Gordon, how's the wife? - Francis, nice hat. - Snickelfritz. - Good to see you again. - Millie are those new roller-skates? - Hello Barbara. - Barnett! - Guys! It's been ages. - You're looking slim. Lincoln, Washington, nice to see you boys. Quiet! Everyone, listen up. We're gonna have to tell him someday. Tell him what? That everybody's deserted him? You know the old coot's temper. I want my minions to make ready a celebration, you see... ...I'm taking a bride. - Way to go! - Atta way to go, your Highness! You'll look great in tails. She comes to us highly recommended. I'm certain you will serve her as you have served me. And now, I must prepare to meet my bride. She arrives at any moment. Doesn't she? - In a jiffy. - In a jiffy. What do you think that was Godfrey, what do you think that was? There's another one! A boy. I hope there's nothing serious between them. Don't run away from me! Hey! What the... What are you? "I'm not a 'what', I'm a 'who'. Like... like you. You are, aren't you? Like me. Where did you come from? What are you doing here? I'm on a journey to find other little people like myself. That's exactly what I'm looking for! Wow, I've never met anybody like me before. Me neither! Where are you from? I... I don't know. Neither do I! I do remember one thing. One word. From my past. Horse. Horse? Go figure. I probably dreamed it. But Ben told me, I definitely came from someplace. Who's Ben? He raised me. - Was he big? - The biggest. And the kindest. Who raised you? I wasn't exactly raised. I was incarcerated. But that's all in the past. I am on my own now. Well... ...I was thinking that since well... ...we seem to be looking for the same thing. Maybe we could be on our own together. I... I would like that very much. You see, Mummy, we told you! Oh no! Did we exaggerate, Mummy? It looks like pond sludge. My words exactly! The short one's sort a cute. At least he's male. Let's just ignore them. Ben says if you ignore something, it goes away. Yeah, we can ignore them but they won't go away! Trust me! Stop that! I'm serious! If you're so serious, Smarty, why are you wearing that? It probably doesn't even have a name. I do have a name. It's Thumbelina! That's the dumbest name I've ever heard! Well, you have to admit, it's a pretty silly name. And what's your name? Tom. Tom... I didn't catch that. Tom Thumb. Okay? Thumb. And my name's silly? Tell me, Tom Thumb. Do you think all little people are as short as you? I don't know, Thumbelina. And I don't know if they're all as rude as you! - What are you staring at? - What are you staring at? Between you and me, Tom. I don't think there's magic in this relationship. Well, we don't really have a relationship. Terrific! I suggest ditching the beanpole. It's all for the best. Have you met my daughters? I guess I'll say goodbye then. Fine! That's just how I want it too! Thumbelina! Wait up! Where are your friends? They are not my friends. You're my friend. I am? Sure you are. Look, I... We... we've never met anyone like us. You, me. You know? I know. I, I guess we have some things to learn about each other. You know? So maybe, if you want to, we could learn about each other... ...together. I guess she'd rather be on her own after all. My little darling. Welcome to my palace. So soft. So shy, so fragrant! Thanks so much. Send in the chambermaid on your way out. We need to prepare a hole for our guest. That really isn't necessary. I won't be requiring a hole. I can't stay. And so witty. I was the chambermaid last time. And you did it so well. The snood suits you. I thought it was a nice touch. We'll have a huge wedding, sparing no expense. All my subjects will be in attendance. We'll invite everyone in the forest. Everyone I haven't terrorized, banished or imprisoned. As for those I've eliminated, they won't know what they're missing! Look, this is all very flattering but... ...well, there's someone else. Nonsense. Whomever it is could not possibly compare with me! I shall woo you. You'll come to love me. You haven't heard me sing? I know all the words to 'Auld Lang Syne'... ...and I know what they mean. I can perform the tenor and the baritone parts in the "Ring" cycle. Simultaneously! And you haven't lived until you've seen my... ...Richard the Third.

I want you to find the most elaborate, desirable... ...comfortable hole in my kingdom. Make it ready for my Queen. For Queen... I don't know your name, my dear. Thumbelina. Well, we'll have to do something about that. Prepare the wedding! - Don't I have a say in this? Of course not! We'll have a wonderful life together. I insist! I think he's awfully dreamy, really. And I would love so very dearly, if you would like... A little fiber for you. Taste it, it's ever so juicy! Yeah, give me that, give me that. Your shoe. Hey, where'd you find this? You twit! That belongs to the beanpole! Where did you find it? Around. Around here?! There! Oh no. I have to go after her! She's everything I ever dreamed of! Great work, Morons! If you had just listened to me everything... Well, what miracle has brought about this most welcome silence? Take your pick. These are my best holes. Well, a choice is so difficult. They're all very, very nice holes. Have you found a hole that pleases you my love? I think so. What are you in for? He wants to marry me. Untie me fast. That's a fate worse than death. What are you in for? I have no idea. Godfrey, Daniel. What's on the menu for my engagement dinner? Your favorite! Sparrow Quiche. Faster! Where are you my love? Thumbelina? Thumbelina? Pumpkin. Are you playing hide and seek? The Mole King doesn't like games. Thumbelina! Thumbelina! Once we're outta here, head straight for the skies! One problem. I can't fly! What? Godfrey! Daniel! But every bird knows how to fly, it's instinctual. The moles captured me... ...right after I fell outta my nest as a chick. I never learned. I have two words for you. Sparrow Quiche. But I'm a very quick study. She's left me! My Queen is A.W.O.L.! Bring her back! Tout de suite! Understood? I'm not certain I grasp the French... ...but I'm with you on the general meaning. - Understood! - Understood! Hurry! Moles at six o'clock! Hold tight! We're almost there. Almost there. Almost. What do we do now, Godfrey? What do we do now? Prudence demands a hasty retreat. I'm with Prudence. I'm sure I'll acquire aerial expertise sooner or later. We're safe now! But I don't have any idea were we are. I have to find Tom. - Who's Tom? - He's my... My friend. After what we've been through, you can smile? It, it's just that I like the way it sounds. You know, I've never said it before. My friend. It feels good. What's the matter? I thought we were friends. We just shared a very dangerous moment back there! Yeah, that we did and I'm very grateful to you. - You are? - I am. My friend. My name's Albertine. Mine's Thurnbelina. I know. It's a silly name. Nothing can hurt us now. We're friends. We're safe. We're friends. We're in a lot of trouble! Run! Run for your life! Help! Help! My friend. There's not enough air. We're all gonna die! - Thumbelina! - Tom! Are you alright? It's that girl. I know she was bad news! This is all your fault! Look, explain to me... ...how all this could possibly be my fault? - Some things just are! - Some things just are! The colors of this one. Look, there's nothing to worry about. He looks like a good kid. He won't hurt us. - Mommy! - Mommy! What is she doing? I've got a plan. That's the girl of my dreams. About to become the girl of your memories. It pains me to say I told you so. But when I'm right, I'm right. Come closer. You can talk! Barely. Barely. I'm fading fast. Closer. Sweet dreams, kid! I always said you were special. Yeah! Mummy! Bravo! Oh, my goodness! Oh, please help us. Pull me up! - Put your arms into it girls! - I'm doing the best I can. What do you say we get outta here? Wait a sec. Okay, everybody. C'mon, hurry up! Hurry up, you're free! Thanks, sister! Why'd you do that? I know how they feel. We're on the ground now. You can let me go. Yeah, sorry. Thanks for deep-sixing the kid, missy! Yeah, thanks muchly! They're here! - Welcome. - Welcome. Hey, hang on there. I hereby proclaim a celebration... ...in honor of our two new friends and their heroic deed. There's gonna be some dancing and singing and... Avocado Ice Cream! We love avocado ice cream! Is there room for three more? I want that girl. Not just something that smells like her! Find her! You can help peel the avocado. - Great. - It's a three-man job. They're slippery suckers! Oh, my goodness! Here it is. Oh, no, no, no. Where to start? Where to start? A bath certainly! A trim, most definitely. A party, you say. And there's another man in the picture? Regrettably, yes. He's got nothin' on you in the looks department, if you ask me. I must demonstrate that I'm the better catch. I must woo her anew. I must show her the best of me... ...and if that should fail... ...I'll simply dismember the competition. That's fair, don't you think? - More than fair. - Yes! Call my handmaidens at once. I need my cape, my dancing shoes. I'm stepping out! I'm almost ready. Where's the other one? Leola, it's me. Thumbelina. It's me. Thumbelina! Can't be. Why, baby, you're the loveliest thing I've ever seen. So pretty. I'm pretty? No one has ever brushed hair before. No one's ever, ever hugged me before. And I guess I just didn't know what it would feel like. And how does it feel, baby? Wonderful. Whoa! - What a babe! - What a babe! Well, that one's a goner, girls. Fan out and snare yourself a rodent. C'mon, move out! Albertine! Thumbelina! I've been on your trail all day. Just as I think you're in one place, you're in another. Is that Tom? Now I know everything is going to be alright. All my friends are here. You mean you don't know how to fly? To work, girls, to work. Look Thumbelina. I'm sorry we got into that fight. Those fight. It was my fault, too. It'll be different tomorrow when we set out to find home. What happens if we get there and you find somebody... ...taller? You'll see. I'm still looking for home. But not somebody taller. I sort of found my home when I found you. You... You are my dream. And you're a big part of mine. But I can't stop until the dream I've dreamed for so long... ...is complete. Until I've found that place where I feel I really, truly belong. Can we look for it together? Yes. You know... ...for the first time in my life... ...I don't feel like a, like a reject. I never really thought there could be anybody like me. And you were right about that. There is nobody like you, Thumbelina. One day, it happens I turn and see the lady who certainly will change my life It happens one day And one day the birds will sing The trees and everything Will go one, two, cha, cha, cha One, two, cha, cha And one day, and instantly The fuzzy-wuzzy bumblebee will go One, two, cha, cha, cha One, two, cha, cha And one day One day Out comes the sun The mice, the geese and everyone will go One, two, cha, cha, cha One, two, cha, cha, cha One, two, cha, cha, cha One, two, cha, cha, cha One, two, cha, cha, cha One, two, cha, cha, cha On this beautiful day I'm waiting. Wait no more! Hello. Guess who? I guess you could say I'm dressed to kill. I love a good cha-cha-cha! I said I love a good cha-cha-cha! May I? I'll lead. Let him go! Is he your little friend? Pathetic! He certainly was a goofy dancer! Can't hold a candle to your hoofing, your majesty! - Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!" Look out for the... Thumbelina! Oh, moles! I can't have lost her! Thumbelina! Was ever woman in this humor wooed? Was ever woman in this humor won? Not on your life! You are going to be my Queen. And this time, I am taking no chances. My minions are blocking off all avenues of escape. This is your home. Forever! I'll get away. I always do. I've managed to extricate myself from more venal pigs than you! More venal? Maybe. More clever? More inspired? I don't think so. You see, I have a little insurance this time. Your tiny friend, Tom, is also my prisoner. Cloistered safely at least so far. In another section of my lair. But you see, there aren't enough permanent holes for two of you. Marry me, and I'll see that no harm comes to him. Alright. I'll marry you. You've made me so happy. Godfrey, Daniel. Prepare the wedding! I can't let anything happen to you Tom. I can't. I don't care what happens to me. Tom. The moles have blacked all tunnels. There's no way down. There is one. It's a half day's journey from here. Let's go! Wait a sec! How do you know about this hole? I just know. That's all. Come clean, sister! How do you know where the Mole King lives? I used to date the guy, okay? When I was young. I was lonely. Alright? Thumbelina saved me once. Now, I can repay her. Climb aboard. I really don't like to fly. That's okay. Neither do I! That is so reassuring. There! First hole to the left of the escarpment! Hang on! I haven't completely perfected my landing skills! "I haven't completely perfected my landing skills!" Landing skills! Okay. Listen up you two. I've got a plan. As long as it doesn't involve air travel! Why do you stay? He's horrible to you. Yeah, he may be a fascist! But... ...he's our fascist! - He's our fascist! We're scared of the guy. And well... We don't have anywhere else to go! I was frightened once. And I thought I didn't have anywhere to go. But I got away. Yeah, and look where you ended up! In a dark hole, engaged to a rank mole. I got away once. And I can get away again! The King's got you for good... ...and if you're smart, you'll play it cool. You haven't seen the King really angry. - You could lose inch on the hem. - Godfrey, Daniel. My bride! Now! I do. I can. I always cry at weddings. Before this day is over... ...I hope to give you something to really cry about. We gathered here today to join this Mole and this woman... ...in holy matrimony. If there be any mole among you that know of any cause... ...why these two cannot be joined... ...let him or her speak or forever hold his peace. I thought not! Your Majesty... ...do you take this woman... I'll give you a reason why this woman can't marry this mole! Who dares to interrupt? I dare. Thumbelina loves me. I think. Minions! After him! I'm still here! Minions? Decimate him! Minions? There are only two guys here! Two guys! You don't have any minions. Look! I can see. I can see. How beautiful you are! I can see how short you are. I can see. I can see two moles! Two very unlucky moles! I plead insanity, your Majesty? I can see some changes are going to have to be made! The only change that's going to be made is the identity of the groom. That's not the change I have in mind. This is my sandbox and you can't play! I am not in the giving vein today! Come with me, my sweet. Let go of me! Get your hands off me. Stop! Disgusting! Let go of me! Let go! Wait! Your Highness! Your Majesty! Not so fast fur balls! First, you've got to deal with Mama Leola! You see, I plan for every contingency. That's what makes me regal! Please, no. No, I... I'm afraid of the dark. Oh, you'll come to love it as I do. We don't need light. We don't need anything. We have each other. Now and for always in my kingdom of perpetual night! We're so alike, my little Thumbelina. Both of us, rejects. I'm proud to be one. You'll grow to accept being one too. I am not a reject! Wait, pumpkin! Your king commands you to stay! Oh, so wise, so young, they say, do never live long! Guess again! No! Thus far into the bowels of the land... ...have we marched on without impediment! Dig straight up. Here! C'mon! Know what to do? Get that mouse! Where's the love? Trust me? - I do! - You do? Yes, I'm that kind of girl! No! Godfrey! Daniel! You are in such trouble. He always like a good exit. What do we do now Godfrey, what do we do now? This looks like it might just be my size! Your size? If you think for one minute that you're gonna be the new King... ...after I spent all that time dressing up as maids... ...and ladies-in-waiting and things... ...you're outta your mind! Gimme! - Give me! It's not over yet. She still has to land! I don't think I can. You can! Hey look, man! Albertine! Down! Bravo Albertine! It's okay. I see a spot to land. Fine! Just land anywhere! The dandelion patch, right next to... ...that village of little people. - Village of Little People? - Village of Little People? Princess Maia? Princess Maia! Princess Maia. My Child! My beauty! Are you really my mother? I have a mother. Tom, I have a mother! I don't know how but you're home. Home. And we'll never lose each other again. This is where you belong. Where I belong. And this must be my father. Now Maia. I have another surprise for you. So good to meet you, my love. This is your intended. My what? My darling, I know this is all so very sudden. I'm certain we'll be very happy once we're married... ...and get to know each other. We have to talk. Look... ...ever since I can remember people have been telling me what to do. And I did it because I didn't know any better. Well, now I make all my own decisions. Look, Prince... ...I'm sure you're a great guy. You're handsome, tall, and well, princely.
