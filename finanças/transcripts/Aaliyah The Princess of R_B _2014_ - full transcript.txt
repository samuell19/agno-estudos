R. Kelly. You're kidding. I'm his new manager. We made it official today. Congrats, man, that's big. Yes. Yes. Fabulous. - Where's your sister? - In her room. She on her way down? I don't know. She's practicing again. Hey. Come here. Here you go. Tell her uncle Barry's here. R. Kelly? Yeah. Wow! So, um... All the disappointment with "star search"... Well, she cried for two days, but by day three... Sometimes I wonder where she gets "the focus." Well, she grew up with you singing. Only I wasn't willing to put my life on hold for a career. Now, that little girl upstairs ... she is all in. Now she wants acting lessons. Mm-hmm. Acting? She doesn't want to be put in a box. She wants to do music and act like Streisand and Cher. She wants to do it all. That's good. That's good. All the more reason why she'll do great in Vegas. Vegas? Yeah. Gladys is doing five nights at bally's, and she wants Aaliyah to perform with her. Don't play with us, Barry. I'm not. Look, just because Gladys and I are divorced doesn't mean that she loves Aaliyah any less. She wants her to do a solo and maybe a duet to close the show. All five nights. What do you think, babe? W-W-What ... I think it'll do wonders for her confidence. Oh, yes. That's exactly why Gladys is doing this. She loves that little girl. We all love that little girl. We love Gladys, too. Just have fun out there. Don't worry about missing a note. Don't worry about that guy in the audience that might not be smiling. When you out there, just love on them. "Love on them," auntie Gladys? Mm-hmm. I'm gonna tell you a secret, something I learned when I was just about your age, performing with the pips. The secret to delivering a great show, the kind that folks are glad they spent their hard-earned money on, is to perform with love. Baby, you gotta love that stage. You gotta appreciate every person in each one of those seats. And you've got to never forget that they could've been somewhere else, but they chose to hear and see you. Hold for one? Love to. Thanks. Now, if you remember that and you love on that audience from your heart, they'll not only feel it, but they're gonna want to re-live that feeling. Which is why your fans come see you over and over again. You know, when I told that promoter that my little 11-year-old niece wanted to be a part of the show, they were concerned that you were gonna crack under pressure. Ladies and gentlemen... You know what I told 'em. Pressure makes diamonds. ...please give a warm welcome... And we are flawless diamonds, the perfect cut. ...To the incomparable empress of soul... The perfect color. ...Gladys knight! You ready? Let's do this. Call me later. Bye, Keisha. Bye. Hey, babygirl. So, what did they say? What did they say? Jive gave us a distribution deal. Oh, this is so cool, uncle Barry! This is beyond cool. You know what this means? You're gonna be rich? It means now that we've got distribution for blackground, we can put out records on whomever we want. You mean...? Yes. For real? For real. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I got a record deal! I got a record deal! Come on. Mm-hmm! Make sure it's straight. Don't you worry 'bout what I'm doing. It's the Detroit high school for the performing arts, mom. Anybody could be in the audience! And I don't know that? When I'm introduced, should I be introduced as Aaliyah Dana Haughton or Aaliyah Haughton? Well, that's a good question. What do you think, mom? Mm. The simpler, the better. So just...Aaliyah. Yeah. Just Aaliyah. Like Cher or Madonna. Aaliyah. Yeah. Why not? I like it. Yeah. Looks good, grandma. Mm-hmm. I know what I'm doing. Whoa, let's give them another round of applause, ladies and gentlemen! Keisha. I know you get nervous, but you're gonna be great. Now, go out there and kill it. And our next performer needs no introduction. She's simply the one and only Aaliyah! Make some noise, ladies and gentlemen! Hey, hey! Come on! Come on!

That's nonsense. Is it? I mean, so far, I've only done school talent shows and plays. Which you kill every time, like you did tonight. Like that matters. Uncle Barry has jive. Why does he need me? How about your dad and I call Barry tomorrow? Actually, do you mind if I meet with uncle Barry tomorrow without you guys? We're your managers. It's our job to have these types of conversations. I know, mom, but... Please? Please? Hi. Hey, babygirl. Didn't know you were passing by. Is this a bad time? No. Not at all. What's up? Will you be completely honest with me? Most definitely. What's ... What's on your mind? Is everything okay? Well, I haven't even really been in the studio. I-I understand if you guys don't believe in me anymore. So... If you're not gonna make my album, just tell me. Aaliyah, you are so far off, it's almost funny. I am? Yes. I've just been waiting for the right moment. And I know it's been a long time, but it has to be the right play. I've been working one angle since I signed you. And I'm close ... real close, but I can't tell you yet. I'm gonna need you to trust me. Can you do that? Hmm? Yes. ♪ it's me against the world ♪ I want to talk to you about my niece, man ... Aaliyah. This again, man? Can I ... can I celebrate my album for a minute, please? C-Can I do that? Damn. I-I'm finally in a position where I can produce anybody, man. You know that. So I don't understand h-how you're still sweatin' me about working with some kid. Robert, if she was just some kid, would I be coming at you like this? I'm doing you a favor. Favor, huh? Okay. I'm only, like, the most in-demand writer/producer in the game right now, that's all. Yeah, I know that. I'm the one fielding the calls. Look, just listen to the girl sing for you. If you feel the same way afterwards, I'll never mention the subject again. Just go in there and be yourself and everything will fine. Be myself in front of r. Kelly? Mom, he's, like, the king of R&B. This is only the most important audition of my entire life. This ain't about r. Kelly. This is about you. If he doesn't see your talent, that's on him. But if you don't bring it, it's on you. Babygirl. Hey. Hey, how are you doing? You made it. Where's your mother? Um, she's still in the car. Rob. Rob! Rob', this is my niece Aaliyah. Aaliyah, r. Kelly. It's an honor to meet you. Yeah, you too. You know, Aaliyah's a huge fan of yours. When I told her you agreed to let her sing for you ... I don't mean to cut you off, man, but i-I'm kind of crunching time here. So, you know, if we could move this along a bit. Vocal booth's in there, through that door. There's some headphones on the stand for ya. Okay. Um, right. You know, you could be a little friendly. Man, you asked me to listen. I'm listening. You didn't say nothing about friendly. Why you acting like I ain't got deadlines to meet. You'll finish your Janet Jackson remix. You're a week ahead of schedule. Man, it ain't just Janet, though. I got that song for Michael. And I got my own remixes, so you know, excuse me if I seem a little preoccupied.

Just come back in right now. Come back in. R. Kelly wants to write and produce your album? Can you believe it? You're gonna go platinum right out of the gate. Your whole world's about to change, sis. Okay, what I'm missing? The hottest producer in the music biz wants to work with you, and you're acting like you just lost a talent show. I have no experience in the studio. What if I mess up? Stop worrying. You're gonna be fine. And hey, if things don't work out, you'll make my life a whole lot easier. How's that? By being a normal teenager like me again. And who knows? You might even get a "b" or a "c" someday. What?! Hi. Hey. What's up? Y'all settled in? Yeah, the label got me a spot downtown with our own kitchen, jacuzzi, and a view. That's good 'cause we're fitting to change the game right now, girl. You ready? Yeah, I'm ready. You sure? You don't look ready. You look nervous. Is it that obvious? Stop thinking you still gotta prove something to me. You're here 'cause you earned it. Ou did your thing on the Mike, and the pressure's on me now. Know what I'm saying? Now I gotta deliver. All you gotta do is you just ... You just do what it is you do, baby. Now, what I’m-a fitting to do is I’m-a give that soft voice of yours an edge. All right, I'm gonna get you to sound like... Sound like ... Well, I'm gonna get you to sound just like mine, you know ... street. You with it? Yeah, I'm with it. All right, let's do it then. You're rushing it, baby. Lay back a little. I just feel like I'm not on beat. Forget the beat. What matters is ... is ... Is your flow. You know what I'm saying? 'Cause right now, you're forcing it. But what you need to do is just let it come naturally. So try it again for me, but this time, what I want you to do is, I want to just have fun with it. You know what I'm saying? Just have fun with it like you was doing earlier, and give me a little less perfection and a little more of that sweet tone. Just it make it more... More 'liyah. Okay. I like that part. Yeah? Yeah. Where you can be like, "ah-ah-ah" Yeah. Wanna get something to eat before you head back to the hotel? Um, I don't know. Come on, my treat. Anything you want. Anything? Anything. Okay. What? You had the choice of the finest restaurants in Chicago, and you chose here. I'm sorry. I'm kind of a pizza girl. Do you wanna leave? Nah, nah, it's cool. It's ... it's... It's perfect. Hey, there. There you go. Thanks. Thanks. You know I did my homework on you, right? I seen you on "star search." Oh, no, did you see me cry, too? Mm-hmm. Ain't nothing wrong with crying. Your feelings show me who you are, and that's important. Besides, you were just 10 anyway. I wanted to win so bad. I want to win at everything, every day, since I was a kid. Music, basketball ... Everything. As I got older, I realized that setbacks can have an upside. Upside? Yeah. I believe that, uh, the depth of your struggle determines the height for your success. I really believe that. The thing that stuck me about you is that, even at 10, when other kids would've given up 'cause things didn't happen as fast as they hoped, you still stuck with it. I love performing. It's all I've ever wanted to do. Same here. Music... Music saved my life, man. I-I-I grew up in Da' hood, you know what I'm sayin'? South side of Chicago, single mother raising four kids. Where was your dad? Couldn't tell you. Matter of fact, my mother was my dad. She passed away earlier this year ... cancer. Yeah, it was tough growing up in them projects. We struggled, man. There were days that nearly broke my mother's soul. Ain't nothin' like seeing your own mother cry. So when I tell you that music literally saved my life, I'm keeping it real with you. Matter of fact, my mother's favorite thing in the world was to hear me sing. Sounds like my family. Yeah? Yeah. That's good. That's good. You should use that. Let it drive you. That's what I do. You know, I-I take the pain from losing my mother, and I try to ... I try to turn it into something beautiful, you know? Something that people can connect to. 'Cause that's what good music does, you know? For three, four minutes at a time, you can make somebody's life seem just a little more better. And that's a gift. That's so crazy. What? My whole life, people told me I had this gift. I felt like I had to do something with it. You know, make a difference. And you will. Just a matter of time. You sound pretty sure yourself.

Right. It definitely fits our market. Here we go. Hello. Welcome. Good afternoon. Diane. John McKinney with jive. Mark Jones. Also with jive. Kate is the stylist we brought in to help craft the "Aaliyah" image. Hi. Diane. She works with some of our biggest acts. Great to meet you, Aaliyah. Hi. So, let me show you some ideas that we had. Mm-hmm. The look we're going for is kind of... It's kind of like a "diva glam," right? You know what? We brought a couple of ideas ourselves. Sure. So maybe we can mix them in a little bit? - No problem. - Sure. Okay. Oh! I'm not ready yet! It's me, babe. I just got here. Robert? Heard you don't like anything they picked out. They're not me. We need an image that's marketable, baby. And I get that. But these clothes are so far away from who I really am, people will think I'm fake. I will feel fake. Yeah. The only time I wear a dress or a skirt is when I go to church. I do jeans. If jive is spending so much time on this "look," then at least make it unique, you know? Something that fits the sound and feel of my music. A'ight, well, if I were to describe it, I'd say the sound and the feel of your music is... ...street. Then why not give them that? Now, that's just genius. You approve? Girl, you're looking dope! Come here. Come here. Look. You're just missing one thing. Hold up. Hold up. Okay. Try that. There you go. You like? I do. Hey, Aaliyah. Uh, whoa. Uh, we're ready for you. You all set? Yeah, we're good. Can I come in? You could at least wait for me to answer. Come on, Aaliyah, I didn't ask before you had an album, and I'm not gonna ask now. Mom told me about your new look. Yeah, you like? Yeah, I'm feelin' it. Yeah? Now you're being extra. So, what did the label think? You know, I didn't think that Robert was gonna back me up, but he did. And I thought he was gonna treat me like a kid. But he's so amazing. You know, he... He and I talk about everything. It's like we're best friends. And is that all you are? 'Cause you sound like you got a thing for him. Why don't you mind your business? But you are my business, and I don't want you to get hurt. Get out. Aaliyah ... Get out of my room, Rashad! Bless us, oh, lord, for these thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty. And thank you for this meal that Diane has so lovingly prepared, and for all that is about to happen for babygirl. We celebrate her first single being released tomorrow, and we thank you for all your blessings. Through Christ our lord, amen. Amen. Amen. Now let's eat! What's a matter, babygirl? You hardly said a word all night. Are you okay? You're not nervous, are you? A little bit. I can't lie. I would be, too. I've dreamt about this moment for so long. Tomorrow, my whole life is about to change. Our lives are about to change. Now, when you're all rich and famous, you're not gonna forget about your old grandma, are you? Grandma, no. Well, just to be sure... That's the ring that your mother gave you. I know. Had it more than 50 years. Now it's yours. What're you doing? Had it re-sized to fit you. I-I can't accept this. Shh! Don't argue with your grandma. This way, no matter how far your gift takes you, I'll be right here. Thank you. Aaliyah! This car's on its last legs. Why would you want to fix it? This car does its job for this family. Yeah, a bad one. Aaliyah, come on! We're gonna be late for the dentist. Dentist, dentist, dentist. She's a local girl, 15, and reppin' the "d" in a big way. Turn it up! Turn it up! What? Turn it up! ...Written and produced by r. Kelly and hits record stores in two weeks, and her first single could be her first hit. Listen to her sweet voice, people. I'm on the radio! Here's Aaliyah with "back & forth." You're on the radio! Aah! Yeah! What's up, baby? How are you doing? Hey. Thank you for coming. Come on in. Have a seat. Live in the studio, the one and only Princess of R&B, Aaliyah. Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. "Age ain't nothing but a number" went to number one with no signs of slowing down. You've created a-a whole new sound yourself, right? If you ask me, I believe that "age ain't nothing but a number" is actually redefining R&B because it's R&B from a hip-hop perspective. And hip-hop is the sound of young America, so it helps that it comes from an artist who is young America. Right. No doubt. It's real. Yeah, and hip-hop is all about keeping it real, so you know... You know! Right. So, how has your life changed? You know, I get to, um, perform at arenas in front of thousands of people. And the audience knows every word of my songs. Security does have to go with me to places I've been going my entire life. That's always kind of crazy. But, you know, I have the same chores, same friends. Shout out to my girl Keisha. I know she's listening. Um... And, uh, when I'm not doing stuff like this, I'm hanging out with my family, or they're on tour with me. But you got that big money now, right? So you gotta have some new pleasures. This might sound kind of boring, but I still like to do the same things that I did before I had this career. Okay, like what? Going to the mall near my house, sneaker shopping at foot locker, bussin' a grub at little Caesars. Hey, little Caesars is the bomb, right? I know, right? Tell me about your tour. I am about to go to Europe with Keith sweat and blackstreet on the "rhythm & blues explosion" tour. I'm about to go to places I've always dreamt about. And what about "kells"? W-W-Will "kells" be joining you on any dates? No. I understand that you two became very close during this project. Yeah, Rob and I are close ... We're very close. So, all the stuff about you two being romantically linked? We are absolutely just friends. Hey, babe. Hey, Mr. Kelly. I missed you. I didn't miss you at all. I hate this ... Hate that we can't be together. Hate pretending that you're just my producer. Me too. Me too, babe, but, um... It'd be better for both of us if we just keep this on the low for now, you know? I get it. Do you? 'Cause if the media finds out, they're gonna have a field day with it. And ain't no tellin' what could happen. I don't care. I only want to be with you. I want to be with you, too, 'liyah. Whenever I'm not with you, I don't even feel right. It's like... It's like I'm missing an arm or a leg or nose or something. You know, for real, sometimes ... Sometimes, I can't even concentrate on my own music. I was afraid of this, you know. I seen it happenin'. I felt it inside, and... I tried to fight it. I did, but... I can't keep fightin' what I believe, man. I believe we were made for each other. I do. Otherwise, god wouldn't have put you in my path, and I've been feeling like this. We gotta wait, babe. Just a few more years. 18 feels like an eternity from now. You did what? Believe me, I can imagine what you're thinkin'. But I promise you, it is not that way. No, dad, stop! Mike! Mike! Get off of him! Stop it! You need to calm down. How am I supposed to stay calm?! You hear what he just said?! Aaliyah, what the hell is going on? We got married. But that's not even possible. You're only 15 years old. Did you lie on the marriage license? Aaliyah?! I love him. Are you crazy?! The man is almost twice your age! So what?! So you're still a child, that's what! You don't even... And what the hell do you want with a 15-year-old girl?! We trusted you! Man, I wish I could find the words to make you understand. Understand?! Understand how a grown man could wanna be with a young girl? With all due respect, we don't get to choose who we love. Don't say it! 'Cause I bet that's what you've been telling my daughter, knowing that she's young enough... And naive enough. ...to believe it. This will be annulled. You cannot make us do that. Oh, yes, we can. It will be annulled, and your relationship, both personal and professional, is over. He is my husband! 'Liyah, maybe we better do as he says. No! We love each other. That's enough! You'll do exactly what I say, or he's going to prison. Daddy! Annulled, Aaliyah. Stay away from my daughter, or I'll have you charged with statutory rape. You understand? I hate you! You're ruining my life! Come on, come on. Do we understand each other? Do we understand each other?! Robert! I hate you! I hate both of you!

Hardest part are the times I gotta do things I don't like, to protect my family, protect you. How is forcing Robert out of my life protecting me? He didn't hurt me. You and mom did. Aaliyah... You and your brother are the two most precious things in the world to me and your mother. It kills me to see you in this much pain and to know I caused it. But I did it out of love. And I'd do it again. 'Cause a father does what needs to be done, no matter what. And maybe it don't make sense now. Maybe it never will. But I love you. Hey. Hey. Well, thanks for meeting me today. You make it sound so official. We ... we got to talk about some business. As you know, Atlantic records is our distributor. They want to meet in New York to talk about your next album. Do I have to be there? Yeah, you have to be there. It's your album. Can't you go and meet with them and just conference me in? That wouldn't be a good look. Look... We gotta get your next record out as soon as possible. After the tour. - Hi. - Hi. Your uncle called. He's worried about you. He's worried about my next album. That too. But Barry's not the only one. We're all worried. Why's everyone making such a big deal about this? What's the rush to make another album? 'Cause it's you. The Aaliyah I know, that little girl who dreamed of a record deal her whole life, she doesn't do "downtime." The Aaliyah I know likes being in the studio. You want a break, that's fine, but be honest about it. What's up? Aaliyah, talk to me. Did you like my last album? Of course I did. Me and over a million other people. Then y'all should thank Robert. It was his sound, his beats. I must be the most successful puppet in the world. Aaliyah. It's true. No, it's not true. Look, r. Kelly did his thing. I'll give him that. But I'm not giving him all the credit. What're you talking about? Robert created me. No. Robert did what a producer is supposed to do. But that wasn't his voice on "age." That wasn't his vocal style on "back & forth." It's been your look that's captivated millions of young girls. It's you in those videos. Look, I know the music business, and let me tell you. It takes more than a great song or some hot producer to create a superstar. It takes the right artist. That's what Robert had in you. That's what he saw when you walked into that studio. He saw Aaliyah. And so did the rest of the world. I'm worried that I'm gonna fail without him. I'm scared that this next album won't ... Success or failure ain't measured by record sales or radio spins or grammys. It is measured by you, by what you got inside and how you live up to what you know you gotta do with it. What was that for? For being you. Are you heading out? Yep. Going to work. You're going to work at this hour? How are you getting there? A car's coming to pick me up. Don't worry. I'm getting ready for the tour. Oh, um, you know, I've been thinking. I think I'm ready for a talent agent. You know, it's not enough for me to have my songs on a soundtrack. I'm ready to act. Think you can help me? We'll arrange for some meetings next time you're in L.A. Cool.

Hey, girl. I'll be back in a little while, okay? Trigonometry, huh? My least favorite subject. I've got an exam as soon as I get back. I was a whiz at math when I was at school. Just saying. Oh, my god. Oh, you do not need that right now. You let me worry about how you look. You worry about trig.

Essentially use the same strategy that you employed on Aaliyah's first album with r. Kelly. Hire writer/producers with track records of success. Stack the deck with proven talent. Being Aaliyah's first album went platinum, we strongly believe we can get any producer we want. Great, then I'll start making calls to see who's available. I get your strategy, and the producers that you guys mentioned are amazing. I'm sensing a "but." They all have well-established sounds. That's a plus, right? If I wanted to sound like everyone else. You'll sound like money in the bank. I'd rather sound like myself. You should sound like yourself, Aaliyah. Who would you like to work with? Tim and Missy. Who? Timbaland and Missy Elliott. They're a production duo out of Norfolk, Virginia. Their demo's in my office. What are their hits? They don't have any. At least let them do a song. Actually, I want timbaland and Missy Elliott to produce my entire album. That's, uh... That's a nonstarter. Asking us to support Tim and Missy as lead producers, it's a ... It's a game of roulette. I understand that you guys are trying to help. I do. But how many "flash in the pan" singers do we see go down on their follow-up album because of a supposed hit-maker? A lot. The success of "age" wasn't just because of the brilliant business strategy that my uncle Barry put forth, but it was also the magic between two creatively connected souls. And from that magic came a completely new sound. That's what happens when you go left and everyone else is going right. Timbaland and Missy Elliot are like nothing on the radio right now. Babygirl, you really believe in them? I do. And I know that if you put us in the studio together, we are gonna create something crazy. Also, this is my album. It's my career, and I think that it should be my decision. Hey. Hey. We're hearing that R&B singer r. Kelly got married. The platinum-selling artist, writer, and producer reportedly wed dancer Andrea Lee. Apparently, the two met while she auditioned to be his backup dancer. In other entertainment news, Eddie Murphy's the nutty prof... Aaliyah, your car is here. Coming. I say we play her the one with the double-beat. I'm worried it might be too out there for her. If Aaliyah wasn't down to step outside the box, we wouldn't be here. You don't think it got too much edge? All I know is when she said Missy and Tim, she meant ... Hey. What up, Aaliyah? I'm cool. Hey, girl. This is my brother, Rashad. What's up? What's up? Rashad, this is timbaland and Missy Elliott. Nice meeting you, everyone. Rashad is my creative consultant. He knows all the latest about fashion, movies, music. All right, all right. Welcome to the lab, man. Thanks, man. I'm a big fan of yours. Ah, I like this dude. I want to play you something. Okay. Now, it's something I been playin' with, so if you ain't feeling it, no offense. Let me hear it. So, whatcha think? You hated it. Look. Don't take this the wrong way... But y'all a little crazy. True. He a Lil' off. Yo, really? You are, Timmy. Timmy? He hates when I call him that. Can I call you Timmy? No, you can't. Y'all think my tracks are whack. Dope. That was dope. You mean... Yeah. So the stuff you were saying about me being ... Oh, no, no, no, I meant all of that. But after hearing that track, I am convinced you guys are crazy. In a good way. Mm. So there's a good way? Mm-hmm. Y'all are exactly what I was looking for. I knew y'all would bring it. What's up? It's just... We never had, like, a platinum recording artist willing to rock with us like this. To be honest, we was a little worried about livin' up to "age." I mean, you had r. Kelly behind the board. Yeah, well, I'm not gonna lie. I was a little scared, too. But we got to keep pushing, no matter how scared we are. This could be big for all of us. And to keep it real with you... I need y'all just as much as y'all need me. All right. Let's do this. Oh! What did you think I came here for? Oh! That table over there. Yes. Ryan Nichols. C.A.A. Diane. Sorry I'm late. Thank you. First off, I'm a big fan. Really, your last album was a game-changer. So, what's up? Well, I'm looking to take my career to the next level. You know, with the release of my new album ... You want to make some moves. Exactly. Gotcha. Off the top of my head, I know I can get you a few parts in some urban movies. I was thinking more mainstream roles. Like leads? Look, I'm just gonna be frank with you. It is extremely hard for a black actress to land leads in big studio movies. It's just a real long shot. Look, i-it's not fair, all right? But unfortunately, it's the truth. Whitney did it with "the bodyguard." Yeah, but Whitney isn't R&B and hip-hop. She's mainstream, multi-Grammy winning artist. I mean ... Also, she had Kevin Costner, one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, fighting for her, so... Hey, how's ... How's the album coming? "One in a million," right? Great. Mastering as we speak. Good. I don't think I have to tell you how important a sophomore album is. Usually, it means one of two things ... That the success of the first album was either, you know, luck or ... Or that an artist is here to stay. Look, we understand the music business. I'm trying to break into film. So, are you our guy or not? Let's take it one step at a time. How about that? I don't know. I don't want to do the same thing that we did for the last album. I want to do something different. Mm-hmm. Like what? I want to be inspired. I want to find a stylist that is creative enough to come up with a look that captures a moment. You know? Captures me. I know a guy. His name is Derek Lee. I'll call him. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. And I had a thought about your hair. Mm. Yeah? How about adding a little mystery? Remember Veronica lake? She was a big movie star in the '40s. Yes. She was beautiful. Yeah. Well, she used to cover one of her eyes with her hair. Oh, yeah. You want different, right? I feel it. Nothing wrong with a little mystery. Oh! That's right. That's it. That's it. What do you think, if I had just a little... Yeah. Oh, look who's here. Yes, yes. How's it going, brother? Dude, you all right? Good. Is this the man of the hour? Derek Lee. Hi. Aaliyah. So, Eric told you what I was going for? Yes, he did. And I think whenever you perform ... In concerts, in your videos, on TV shows ... Wardrobe should be treated like your costar. Now, I am a straight guy from the east village. My mother is a fashion editor at essence. So when I go and pick out gear, I don't just want hot and sexy. I want to create the kind of look on a girl that me and the boys from the neighborhood find really attractive. I want to meet his mom. I want to meet his friends. Okay. Now, I'm seeing you as, like, a sexy female superhero, Pam grier, blaxploitation type. Now, I know that you're very used to your loose-fitting clothing, but just please keep an open mind on this one. Wow!

A little bit. Your sophomore album, "one in a million," feels like album of the year. It's doing pretty well. Now, here you go being all modest, knowing full well that your reign as Princess of R&B is officially locked up. You're a bona fide superstar now. I mean, look at this. It's "Aaliyah mania" outside. Thanks so much to all the fans who bought the new album. It's gone double platinum in the U.S. I can't express how much that means to me. And another shout-out to timbaland and Missy Elliot. Y'all did your thing on this album. With "one in a million," you are now one of the biggest names in music. What's life like these days? I'm definitely more comfortable with the fame, but I think I'm more humbled by the amazing things that are happening in my life. What's next for you? Honestly? Movies. Ah! You heard it here first, peoples. Aaliyah, thank you for stopping by. Thank you for having me. All right. Aaliyah, ladies and gentlemen. Game. Are you stacking the deck? Pay up, babygirl. I got it. - Hey. - Hi. Ryan Nichols. Is Aaliyah home? Aaliyah. You do realize that every agency in Hollywood wants to sign her now. Mm. But, hey, I'm the only one here in Detroit and in your living room. So, if she signs, what's your game plan? Well, the idea is we get Aaliyah into the right rooms, with some of the most powerful people in movies, and a soundtrack. She's not really interested in being on another soundtrack. Right, but this isn't just another soundtrack. Do you remember that film "Anastasia"? Yeah. Right, so, fox is doing an animated version with Meg Ryan. I think having you do the theme song would be huge. And it would show Hollywood you got range. And you can make this happen? I'd love to show you. Is that a yes? Okay. Yes! Ha-ha! Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. And thank you. You won't regret this. Ooh, babygirl, you look beautiful. I actually like it. I have to Mark this date on the calendar. My daughter in a dress. You know, I still can't believe it. I have just put on the dress that I will be wearing to perform at the Oscars! At the Oscars. Wow! I am really nervous, mom. Me, too. How many people are gonna see this? Oh, not many. Just about 50 million. Singing "journey to the past" from "Anastasia," nominated for best original song...

Yeah. Thanks. She's gonna be a movie star, Lorenzo. Mark my words. Ryan, with all due respect, almost every singer I've ever met thought they had what it takes to be a movie star. So, what makes you any different? Well, this studio did over $400 million on a movie co-starring Whitney Houston. Now, I'm not sayin' that I'm on her level. But her music transcended color. Because let's face it, that's what music does. And I'm willing to bet that that had something to do with Warner Bros. Giving her that role. Well, I've sold over 12 million records, and 60% of my sales are international. My fans aren't just in the U.S., and they ain't just black. I'm telling you, casting her in one of your movies is gonna be the best decision you ever made. I'm the girl you want to bet on, Lorenzo. I succeed in everything I put my mind to. I have a film I'm working on with Joel silver. Might be a fit. It's an action film starring Jet Li. It's called "Romeo must die." Uh, he was cute, and he was definitely checking you out. Can we talk? Sure. I'm worried about you. You haven't had a serious relationship since ... I'm focusing on my career right now. Besides, love is overrated. Aaliyah. It's been five years. You should be ... Do you know how long it took for me to get over him? I understand why it had to end. But understanding doesn't make me feel any better. When things ended with Robert, I lost a piece of me. No, you didn't. Yes, mommy, I did. And I'm scared of it happening again. Aaliyah! Aaliyah, over here! Over here! Aaliyah, how does it feel to be at the Hollywood premiere of your first movie? It feels amazing. What attracted you to this role? I was looking for the right part, and "Romeo" was a perfect fit. Trish's character is tough, doesn't take crap from anybody, and like me, she's "street but sweet." Where to from here? Well, one of my favorite books is being adapted into a movie, so fingers crossed. ♪ Let's go! ♪ I can't believe you flew in just for my birthday. I know your schedule must be insane. Keisha, I wouldn't have missed this for the world. So, tell me what's going on with you. I got a year left at Wayne state, and I think I'm gonna get this internship at a really cool design firm. That's so awesome. Well, it ain't as glamorous as living on central park west. What made you decide to move to New York? With all the movie stuff you got going on, I figured it'd be L.A. Well, you know, my family's from New York. That's right. You were born there. Yeah, so it's in my blood. Got to feel good to be settled back in one place. Although, I am going to a Roc-a-fella party in the Hamptons this weekend. You should come with me! Damn. I got to stay in town this weekend. Okay. Forget the Hamptons. I got you right now.

But y'all out of here. Dame, man, we were just playin'. Does this look like a playground to you?! We in a $7 million crib rented by Roc-a-fella records! We're black! We're being scrutinized!

Damon dash, crazy? Mm. Did those guys really walk back to the city? I don't know and I don't care. We go back to seventh grade. They know me. And when it comes to protecting family, they also know how I can get. Family? You were protecting a vase. It wasn't about a vase, it was about somebody contacting the press and putting that mess on Jay. He's the biggest rap star on the planet. His name ... our name ... Is a brand I got to protect, regardless of those two knuckleheads. So if I got to be the one no one wants to a problem with, I'm cool with that. Jay, Kareem, the Roc ... They matter. Other than that, I don't care what anybody thinks. I got these guys on my team. They've become brothers to me. The love that I have for them... It's bigger than any business that we got going on. To family. To family. I want to do so much more. So, you got time, girl. Says you. You got like a hundred companies, and you probably want like a hundred more. It's not about the number of companies. It's the challenge of going from Harlem to wall street that's exciting to me. The climb, the chase. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Only problem is, most people have agendas, even if it's just being near somebody rich, powerful, or famous. Yeah, that's the problem with being a celebrity. You get suspicious of people. But at a certain point, it gets simple. It becomes about peace of mind. Knowing people you do let in have your back. Ooh! What? How do you handle the girls? Girls? I ain't got time for no girls. Come on, dame. Women must be throwing themselves at you 24/7. How do you separate the real from the fake? The ones who really want to be with you. Especially knowing that you could change their lives. I mean, it's hard, but being raised in Harlem, you learn how to spot a come up. Mm. I'm not always right, but, uh, my ability to peep game is pretty tight. Yeah, well, I'm from New York and the "d," so... Ah, so you know how to peep game, huh? From the door. If you tell anyone what I'm about to tell you ... You're gonna deny it. To the grave. It does get lonely, though. I can relate. I haven't had a real relationship in years. Me, either. Yeah, and all the success in the world can't take the place of, uh... A kiss from the man that you love. Fine, I'll kiss you if that's what this is about. I wasn't fishing for a kiss. Lord knows where your lips have been with all them video hoes. That's not even cool. I'm just messing with you. Yeah, yeah. Well, you hurt my feelings, girl. Whatever! What? Nothing. Come on out with it. Seriously, I want to hear what you have to say. You know, you kind of have a way of expressing yourself that can be a little...Aggressive. I go off on people when they do something stupid. That's what I do. And you're known for it. But, Damon, a lion doesn't have to roar to be a lion. Even when he purrs, the whole jungle knows that he's the king. So you're sayin' I don't have to be to be a complete jerk to get my point across? I don't think that you're a jerk at all.

But we got to keep pushing the album. Label's concerned. "We need a resolution" didn't get the traction we hoped for. It stalled at 59. Where are we at with VMAs? I spoke to MTV this morning. You're confirmed. Great. And virgin agrees with us ... "Rock the boat" should be the second single. So, we're still on for the video? Took a little negotiating, but we got we needed, yeah. And hype Williams is set to direct. Your girl Fatima Robinson will do choreography. Are we still shooting in Miami? Miami, a couple days in The Bahamas. And I booked your stylist, Derek. What about Eric? Eric has a scheduling conflict, but he's sending a friend in his place. Uh...his name is Chris Maldonado? Yes. Chris is an amazing makeup artist. We're ready for you now. Oh, great. All set? Yeah, just about. Were y'all able to get the catamaran? We got it. Dope. This is gonna be so hot ... Everything about this video, from the choreography to the styling to the location. Unh! I love hearing you this excited. Man, this is gonna be the best music video I have ever done because I'm taking it to a whole nother level. Babygirl, you already have. In the year we've been together, I've watched you grow as a businessperson, as an artist, and as a woman. I hope the world sees me the way you see me because it feels like all my dreams are coming true. Trust me. No one will be able to avoid it. This is it. Yeah. So, what happens after this? After the video? No, after ... After all of it. What do you want to happen? All I know is that you're the only woman I want. I feel the same. So let's not let our careers stop us from spending time together anymore. We're both really busy people, babe. Look, if I got to fly all the way across the country just for a date night, I'm there. Okay, it's settled. Yeah? Yeah. You mean a lot to me. We mean a lot to me. When I get back from this shoot, things will be different. It's time to change our priorities. It's about us. We're about to conquer the world, baby. God, you're so beautiful. God, I love you. I love you, too. I'll be back in a few days, before you even know it. Yeah? You better come back to me. You know I'll be thinking about you every night. All night? Every night. Bye, baby.
