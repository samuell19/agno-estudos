The Vikings were ferocious warriors. The most feared of these ancient pirates were those that not only fought with a blood lusting frenzy but were also known to eat the flesh of their human victims. They were called Berserkers. These Berserkers were used as the first line of assault in Viking raids. They wore bearskin robes, some with bear snout masks that they had killed with their own hands. These snout masks were the upper jaw of the bear with the canine teeth exposed, which they used to tear the flesh of their prey. These snout masks were strapped to the heads of these men, who because of their treatment, the vicious nature of the acts they committed and the sometimes drug-induced frenzy they were forced to endure, eventually went mad. When a berserk became too much for even their fellow Vikings to control, they would be kept in cages and fed raw meat, human and otherwise. When a raid was planned, they would be de-caged, chained and placed in the bow of the Viking boats. They would huddle down in their bearskin robes waiting for the boats to land. When the sound of the boat hitting the shore was heard, they would be released by their handlers. They'd leap out of the boat in a howling frenzy, attacking any living thing in their path, fight in a blood lusting frenzy until they finally fell down exhausted. Only after the Berserkers had completed this first assault would the other warriors join in the battle and mount cleanup operations, which included re-chaining their Berserkers who were often involved in eating their slaughtered prey. It is believed by many persons of Viking heritage that Berserkers who ate human flesh can never enjoy the forgiving peace of a restful death. They are forced to forever revisit the earth by possessing the body of a blood relative. It is said that living humans who are direct descendants of the Berserk will always be in danger of being possessed by them. This possession by the Berserk will cause the death of the possessed and ultimately, the extinction of the entire Berserker bloodline. Mike, it's me, come on, Mike! Mike, it's me! Hey, come on, man, enough's enough. Where'd you get that thing anyway? I don't know, I found it in the woods. Some cross country skier dropped it. It was a joke! It was a joke, come on. Yeah. Well, that's just the biggest scare, huh? Yeah. So, why don't you two kiss and make up? Oh, yeah, right. No more gags, all right? All right! Let's crash, I am beat. Check. Well now, Walt, maybe there's a checkmate, huh? Looks like you got me, cousin. What do you mean, I got you? When I didn't got you, huh? I been winning from you this game for 20 years. 18. Hmm? 18 years ago. 18 years what? Grandpap died. No, no, no, grandad died 26 years ago. I wasn't there, I was in the old country. But when'd Uncle Sallanan die? Uncle Sallanan died 20 years ago. That's when you beat me. Maybe it was 18, no? I don't remember. You want a beer, Walt? Sure, why not? Hey Pappy, did a group of kids come through here today? Ya, ya, they was here, why? Aw, I stopped a pickup full of kids back down the road today, littering. Driver looked like he had a few. Ah, ya, I think I know the kid you mean. Nice-looking boy? Dark hair? Areal wise-ass punk, huh? Name of Josh Winter. Vinter? No, I don't think it started with a v. Walt, look at me. Watch my lips. Winter not Vinter. You know, wall, I worry about you. I think maybe you ought to see a doctor, you know, for the ears? Because lately I notice you don't always understand the words what people say. I worry about you too. 22 years in this country, you still can't speak the language. I speak english much more good than you, I'll bet. Josh Winter. Josh Winter, that's the one. Yep, that's the one. You know, I worry when I see those city kids come out here without somebody to watch over 'em. Where they camping out there tonight? Aw, I sent them over to the Miller place. Miller's? Pretty deep out in those woods, ain't it? No, not for Josh Winter. Nah, he's been coming up here ever since he was small child. Every year now until about maybe four, five years ago. Nah, he knows these woods good. You want another beer or what? No, here you can have this. I didn't touch it. I think maybe I'll ride out and take a look on 'em. You worry too much, Walt. It's been six years. Maybe, but I'll have a look anyway. Walt, you let me know next time you wanna get got on the chess game, okay? I will, Pappy. Have a good one. This place holds a lot of memories for me. My dad and I used to come up here. Ever since I was four or five years old, we come up here and go fishin' and campin', just relax. It's the only time I ever got to really know him. The rest of the year, he was a real bastard. And then he'd bring me up here and we'd leave the city and work, and he would just mellow out. Sounds like you miss him. Yeah, I never thought I would. But up here, I do. Why'd you stop coming up here? About six years ago, there was a rumor a little girl got mauled by bear. A bear? It turned out it was just a rumor. They found her body in the river a few weeks later, she was real torn up, but they figured that happened when she was washed down the rocks in the river. Right after that, dad took off for good. But five years later, I return with my faithful companions. It's too bad you couldn't get the Sargant Campground where your dad... Uh yeah, uh well, this place is fine, it really looks the same, really it's fine, it's fine. Well, Mr. Boy Scout, I've got a question for you. Shoot. Where does one, you know? You know. You know, yeah, you know. Well see, that could be a lot of things. That could be, you know, and then that could be you know. Oh, cut it out. You know what I mean. I think you find the nearest tree, Kris. Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Hey, be careful, remember what happened to that little girl. You're very funny. I'm serious. Pappy! Pappy! Hey cousin, you there? Sure, who is out there? Oh, what the hell you doing here, Walt? It's gotta be goddamned near midnight! Come back from the Miller Place, out looking for those kids. There's nobody there. No? I looked all around the place, doesn't look like anybody's been there for a month or more. You sure you sent 'em out to the Miller Place? There's nowhere else they could have gone? Oh, wait, wait, wait, what a minute, I think I know what happened. You remember I tell you about that Josh Winter? How he used to be here before? He always stay at the Sargant Place. I'll bet he took those kids out there just 'cause I told him not to. I thought Homer and Edna Roberts were staying out the Sargant Place. Yeah, ya, ya, but you see, they never use the cabin, they is always putting up the tent, you know? What's tomorrow, is Wednesday? Yeah. Well, tomorrow morning early, I got to go out and bring them in back here. I tell you what, I look in the Sargant Cabin. I bet I find them kids there. All safe and snuggle, just like bugs, ya? I hope you're right. What do you mean, you hope I'm right? Of course I'm right, that's where they are! You go on home, you get some sleep, Walt. All right. Walt, is only a book. Yeah. Hey. Sorry, dude, I'm gettin' a little worried about Kristi. Mike, maybe we should go look for her. Oh, okay, Josh you hold the fort down, okay? Right. It's all right it's us. Oh, you guys. Oh, I'm sorry, oh after Larry and Josh's stories. Oh, I feel so stupid. Hey, I know what you mean, it's pretty freaky out here. I can't find my way back to the cabin. Well, if you head straight back that way, you'll be there in two minutes. Okay, well, what about you guys? Don't worry about us. Uh. We're just gonna take a little walk. Yeah, okay, okay.

So I did, we were at the Sargant Place. Yeah, but the old man said there were campers there already. Yeah, and it didn't look like anybody'd been there. I hid their tent. So, that must mean...
