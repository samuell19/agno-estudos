RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Hey, guys. - Hey, Corey, how does it look? - Yeah. You guys did great! This is perfect. Duh, no. Hey there. All right, I'll see ya. So did you wanna reschedule with Nate about the Camden projects? You can do his calendar shoot? I'll pass. Okay. So no calendar shoot, then. Did you at least see the article? I don't know that I want to. Well, at least they chose a great photo. What? Bye, Emmy. Bye, Colby. - Bye, Ms. Corey. - Bye. - Mindo. - Bye. Little Emmy Robins. Always working so hard to stay on Santa's nice list. And Colby Robins, Santa's naughtiest MVP. Is that gum? Some things just never change. Jilly? When did you get to town? Just now. - Cole picked me up. - Santa's sneaky little helper. Only not so little anymore. - Mindy, hi! How are you? - Hi! Hi, Jillian! Oh, my gosh, did you get prettier? I didn't think that was possible. How is everything coming with the annual holiday pageant? - Beautifully. - Disastrously. Well, let me take you to lunch. I wanna hear all about it. I am dying for one of Sal's famous frozen hot chocolates. - Yes. - Okay, you guys go. I'll finish cleaning up around here. - Okay? Okay. - Thank you. With the help of Mr. Cole, of course. - I'll see you later at the shop? - Sure. I'll bring your suitcase by your place later. You are a holiday prince. Thank you. - It's true. - Yup. - Bye. - See you in a bit. Well, Cole certainly is growing up to be quite the handsome young man, huh? - Cole? - Yeah. He was a freshman when we were seniors, Jill. I'll always see him as that scrawny little freshman. Only now a mighty tall freshman with awfully big biceps. Okay, calm down. He said he's working for your mom now? - Yeah. - Well... He clearly still has a thing for you even after all these years. He helps out at the antique shop. Carries furniture, shovels our snow, stuff like that. He shovels your snow? How precious! - Jillian Winters? - Yeah, I'm Jillian. Oh, my gosh, you're charity on my show. "Burning Hearts" is my life! Are you up here vacationing? I'm here visiting my parents. No, I'm actually from here, just visiting family a little early for the holidays. I'm sorry, this is my bestie, Corey. - Hi. - Hi. This is just so cool! I can't believe you're really here. It's like we were meant to meet. - Do you mind if we get a selfie? - Of course. Just trying to find Wi-Fi to post this to my story right now. Have a great Christmas. And choose your filters wisely! So my bestie moves to the big city, and then five years later, she's famous. Yeah, well, and someone else could be, too, if only she would join me in LA. Okay, we're not doing this again. Come on, Corey, you loved it both times you visited me there. And just think, it's almost the new year, right? It means new chances to start fresh with new opportunities. Jillian, I'm so happy for you and excited that all your dreams are finally coming true... Well, they used to be our dreams, Cor. Yeah, used to be, when we were, like, 17. That ship has sailed. In fact, all three of them did on Christmas day. You act like you are some old lady when we both know that your bedtime is the only old-lady thing about you. - Two frozen hot cocoas, please. - All right. Okay, so if not Cole, is there a single man left in this sleepy little Tinseltown? What are you, the town matchmaker now? I just mean, what if your one true love is in LA waiting for you to swoop in and sweep him off his feet? Well, if he doesn't wanna come to our perfect little Winter Wonderland to come find me, that's on him. - Ladies, ladies, here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. How did you do that? I'm a pro. Besides, who would wanna be anywhere else at Christmas? You're right. Feels good to be home. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello? Hi, Victoria! I'm in the kitchen! Hi! Your luggage is out. Are you going somewhere? Yeah. Sorry. Davey and I are going skiing. Just for the weekend. Aw! Fun! I love to ski. It's been ages since I've been. - Yeah. - Actually. Yeah, same here. I... What are you up to this Eve? Well, I just thought I would surprise you. See if you wanna grab an early dinner at Carpaccio's, celebrate being LA's hottest holiday bachelor. Hopefully, not for too much longer. Yeah. Yeah, it sounds really fun. Normally, I would if I had the time, but, you know, Davey said he'd be back to pick me up in an hour, so... Yeah... it's fine. I totally get it. I probably should've at least texted first, anyway. We are still on for wine tasting in Temecula two weeks from now, yeah? The winery that your parents want to buy. Of course. That your dad promised my dad you would help out with. Yes. Yes. I'll be there. So I... Can I walk you out? Right. Yeah. - Of course. - All right. - Hi, mom. - Well, hi there. I thought Jillian was gonna be with you. No, she had to drop her luggage off at her parents' place. Have dinner with them. But she told me to tell you hi and that she's gonna stop by and see you tomorrow. Good. I can't wait to see her. Hey, have you seen this? Take a look, take a look. Take a look at this. She's all over the Internet. Are you surprised? No one brings more Christmas cheer than our Jilly. Yeah. And take a look at this handsome fella. "Real-estate tycoon heir, Ryder Donnelly." Isn't he dreamy? Vintage tree-topper. That's beautiful. A girl brought all this stuff in here yesterday, said it belonged to her grandma. And look at this. It's just a sweet little vase. I know I don't need it, but I kinda want to keep it. No, you can't always keep everything and then keep using your retirement money to keep this place open. Yeah, I know. You're right. You know, maybe we should sell it. You know, Ned Baker said that he would love to buy this place and turn it into some fishing, gaming, tackle shop. No, we can't sell this place. We sell the antiques, not the shop. Honey, I think we should think about it. I mean, it would free you up to go do everything that you want to do with the Art Center, and I get back to my crafts and... We're not gonna sell the store. I made a promise to dad. It was a promise he never asked you to make, sweetie. Well, of course, he didn't. But I basically grew up here. Every day after school, I would come here and help you with your arts and crafts or dad with the repairs. - This place is our life. - I know. But I think it's something we should consider. This place was your father's dream. Not mine. Not yours. Mom, you can still retire. And I'll keep working at the Art Center. But they're cutting my annual budget in half next year anyway. So we won't be doing nearly as much. So I can stay here and keep it going. - All right? - I... Corey, if that's what you really want... But I need for you to know for sure what it is you'd be giving up in return. Think about it, okay? Okay. This little town is so cool. Yeah, Jillian calls it Santa's favorite final pit stop in the snow. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Antique store. Pull up over there. You are such an old man, my friend. Hey, you're gonna be okay closing up by yourself? You always ask me that and the answer's always the same, I'll be fine. Tree-topper's coming home with me. It's you. Hel... good evening. Hello. It's a beautiful store you have here. Thank you. I'm ju... I'm just leaving, you know, for the evening. But, my daughter is here and, well, she can help you with anything. Well, thank you. That's very nice. I just wanted to take a quick peek around. Well, you should, yes, just peek away, peek away. Oh, no! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Are, are you okay? No, no, I'm fine. Hi. I'm sorry. It's, I did not mean to break the chair. This was my fault. - I'm happy to pay for it. - No, no. - You don't have to do that. - I insist. You look so familiar. Have we met before? No. I usually ski in Big Bear. At that fancy resort. Okay. Well, do you need help finding anything? No, I was just, just looking around, seeing what you had is all. Okay. Well, just let me know. It's a pretty decent place you have for being out here in the middle of nowhere. Thank you. It's my dad's. And it's not just decent, it's perfect. For the record, we're not completely off the grid. - You know? - Right. Just Santa's final pit stop in the snow. Wait, where did you hear that? It's just, something my best buddy said earlier. Yeah, he's seeing some actress that's from here, apparently. That's why we're here. Well, the correct phrase is "Santa's favorite final pit stop in the snow." And I'm assuming your friend's name is Dave? Davey. Yeah. How did you know that? That some actress is Jillian. We've been best friends my entire life. Small world. I'd like to purchase this. I have a thing for old clocks, and this one's really cool. And I'd like to pay for the broken chair if you let me. I'm sorry, but this clock is not for sale. Wait, why? Did you not see the sign on the shelf that it was on? It specifically says, "not for sale" in big, red letters. Okay. But that's not the reason why it's not for sale. Do we need a reason for not selling something we don't wanna sell? Yeah, reason would suffice, sure. Okay, well, it's broken and it can't be fixed. Trust me, I've tried. Well, maybe I can fix it. Or maybe it's still not for sale. Look. When you posses something this perfect and unique, you don't just hide it away in some shelf to collect dust. You put it out there and you share it for the world to see. And this clock... It wants to tick, to tell time, to live. Are you really gonna deny him that? I'll give you 300 for the clock, another 50 for the chair. What, you think I can be bought? I think I can try, "Corey." Four hundred for the clock, a hundred for the chair. Well, I hope you have cash because if you wanna pay with credit, I have to charge you an additional three percent. You're getting a really good deal, by the way. Am I? It seems a little pricy to me. Listen, Ryder, is it? That chair is older than both of our ages combined, and this clock, it's priceless. Look, you and I both know that chair wasn't worth 20 bucks with the legs. But I do love the clock and I'm willing to pay extra for the handling. So it's fine. Thank you. And I never mentioned my name, so I can only assume you saw the article about me. Nice photo they chose? Stay dry out there. So, I have an idea. The Craft Twins who were supposed to open our pageant with a duet have the flu now. So what would you think about doing our opening number instead? I mean, the whole town would show up for it. That is so sweet, and I totally would. But you know I won't actually be here, right? I leave for LA next week. Remember how much you love these, Jillian? They're on the house. Everyone here watches your show. We just all love seeing you. Thank you. That is so sweet. Katie, I appreciate it. Are you guys expecting anyone else? Yes, we have two more coming. Okay. Take your time. I'll be back. - Wait, what? - Davey and his friend. What, last night you said you wanted to meet him. Well, I... look, I know it's a little soon, but I really like him. He's not like anyone I've ever dated. He's... kind of a dork, actually, but, like, cute and funny and... Wait, why don't you wanna meet him? No, no, I do, I do. I just... You said they were skiing, so... Well, who skis on an empty stomach? - Hi! - Hi! Sit, sit, sit, sit. - Corey, this is Davey. - Hi. This is his best friend, Ryder. And this is my bestie, Corey. - Very nice to meet you, Corey. - Very nice to meet you, too. - Nice to see you again. - Good to see you again. - You guys know each other? - Well... I went into the antique store last night. - To buy an old clock. - I bought a Christmas clock. Okay then. Well, now that we all know each other, apparently, what's good to eat? The cozy country breakfast is the best. You had me at "cozy." - Hi. - Hi. Can we just do, like, four cozies? - Four cozies, coming up. - Great. So, Jilly hasn't told me how you guys met. No? Okay. Well, I'm assuming you saw the Beat Down article with Jillian and Ryder. She saw it. We went over that last night. Yeah. Okay, yup, that, that's the one. Well, I head marketing and PR for his father's firm, so I'm the one that the Beat Down reached out to when they wanted to run this guy as their hottest holiday bachelor online. - Yeah, that's pretty funny. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Continue. - Yeah, no, of course. So, I said I'd get them the interview if and only if they agreed in return to hook me up with the publicist for their snow bunny bachelorette. - Super smooth, I know. - That's so sweet. So are you gonna take him to meet your parents? I think it's a little too soon for him to meet my crazy family. But I'm so glad you guys got to come see our little hometown. I wish you guys could stay for the Christmas Pageant. Is that where you used to sing? Yeah. I did all of them. And Corey here still does them. Does what? - Uh, I just, I oversee stuff. - Oh, please. Corey is the creative director. Okay, she does the Summer camp shows, the Spring showcase, the Fall Harvest festival, the Winter musical and the Christmas Pageants. Aren't you in rehearsals for this week? We should go see 'em. No. It's, it's not ready for visitors yet. Well, tomorrow, after the slope's in. Yeah, no, no, we're doing... Yeah. Doing, we're doing it. We're coming in... Okay. I don't understand why you were being so tough on Ryder at lunch. He is so sweet and genuine. If by genuine you mean genuinely conceited and know-it-all, then, sure, yeah, he's genuine. He went to an Ivy League school, his parents are loaded. What do you expect? Nothing, except for him to leave our tiny town in a timely manner. - Seems like you like him. - Ew, no. Ha! You stay out of this. You do like him. You have a crush on the Hunky Holiday Bachelor. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Hi. As in the Hunky Holiday Bachelor from the Beat Down? I mean, who knows? He could be good for you. He'd help you get out from under that rock you've been living under. Actually, I find him very annoying. The way he walks around, showing off his cash and his fancy faux fur jacket, and that dumb grin he gets on his face any time anyone recognizes him as the bachelor of the year or whatever it is. It's gross. I'm very happy under my rock. Thank you. Yeah, because "gross" is totally the word I'd use to describe that man. Fine, he's all yours. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Hope he's non-refundable. Well, it's too bad you don't like him because I think he likes you. Good evening. Still open? We were just about to close early, but welcome back, I guess. I hope you're not here to buy something else that's not for sale. Cole, this is Ryder. Ryder, this is Cole. He works here and, we went to high school together. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Can we, help you find anything? No, I... I just... I just wanted to get my chair. The broken one? You wanna take that? Yeah, well... Cole, would you mind loading up that old chair into your truck and taking it over to the inn for Mr. Donnelly? - Yeah. Sure. - Thank you. So why are you really here? Actually, I just... I love this place. Just wanted to see more of it, that's all. Okay, then I'll just hang out here and, act like we're open until you're finished. I'd love to... I'd love to talk with your dad about this stuff sometime. You ever have anything appraised? My dad passed away six years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. We used to be much busier when I was growing up, before they put in that fancy ski resort in Big Bear you like so much. If it makes you feel any better, I prefer Alaska for skiing myself. I've actually never been. Always wanted to go there. I wanna see some real reindeer. - You like reindeer, huh? - Who doesn't? They're only the most magical creature there is. Did you know that all of Santa's reindeer are girls? Wait, now, they all have antlers, right? Females have antlers, too. In fact, males shed theirs during the Winter. Females keep them. So, if all the pictures in the stories are true, all of Santa's reindeer are girls. Even Rudolph. - Who would've thought? - Makes sense. Women have a much better sense of direction. Is there a place open nearby where we can get a hot cider? You know, I'd love to hear more of your impressive knowledge of reindeer. I mean, the town pretty much shuts down at 9:00... Unless you wanna go to Fratello's and, crash Jillian and Davey's date. I could, make hot chocolate here and we can take it to go. Candy-cane serve stick. Nice touch. You're welcome. So, how did you get into antiques? Well, well, as you probably know, my parents are in real estate, so... When I was in high school, my mother bought this amazing old estate, got it and renovated into a boutique hotel. And it was, it was filled with all this antique junk that nobody wanted. And my mother, she was gonna dump it, but I just thought it was so cool. So I asked her if I could go through it, and... turns out, there was, there were some expensive stuff in there. So my mom let me do a deal with an antique trader and, I don't know, that was that. That is so cool. Although, maybe not in high school. What, were you trading antiques while all your friends were outside playing lacrosse? What? No, I still played lacrosse. Did both. Of course, you did. Okay, so then are you still buying and selling? Oh, no. I mean, I have a few pieces, but I don't, I don't collect much. But I do like to take a peek in any store I pass by. Although, trading, that's the fun part. Well, if you love it, you should, you should do more of it. Do you make time for, for everything that you love? Of course, I volunteer at the elementary-school art class once a week, I help Cole with his online courses twice a week, and I take my mom to lunch every Friday. Sounds to me like you do a lot of things for other people. Yeah, well, what about you? Jillian tells me that you, you were supposed to move to the city with her after school, but then you stayed here. So... - Why did you stay here? - Well... I still run the Art Center here. That's my main job. Yeah, but you can make a lot more money doing in the city. I mean, that is, if you're talented enough, which, Jillian claims, you very much are. Yeah. It's more so my dad's store, and my mom's gonna retire next year. And if not me, there's no one else left to run it. I'm an only child. And I just... I'm not ready to give it up. The clock... It was your dad's, huh? Look, I can't keep it. I'll give it back. No, no, please. He would want someone to have it who's actually gonna take care of it, and that's you. So... Really, I want you to have it. I've never seen so many stars in my life. And I thought your city was full of stars. Jillian says those two at the end of the constellation there are hers and mine. - Whatever that means. - What... Hey, look. That was mine. How do you know? 'Cause it crossed yours. So you're sure you know how to get back from here? I think so. If not, I'll just follow my star to find my way. Okay, well, thanks again for walking me back. I'll talk to you later. Great job, guys. You kids are really gonna bring down the house Christmas Eve with your show. "Bring down the house" is just a figure of speech which means you're gonna make everyone go crazy, clapping. Okay, I think these kids earned some rest, so we'll pick back up again next Saturday. And for anyone who wants to stick around a while, we have holiday games and refreshments in the rec center. Yeah. He's cute. What are you guys doing here? Well, you know, it was the, the slopes were just looking a little slick, they were. So, you know, here we are. Last night it didn't even freeze, so the slopes would be nice and slushy today. She lives here. She knows stuff, like, if the weather's good for skiing or that you just lied. The truth is, we came to see you. He came to see you. This place is incredible. Did you think this all up? My inner kid loves all this stuff. Is it okay if I show my mom some of this stuff, just to give her some ideas for her annual charity benefit next week? - By all means. - Thanks. Spirit of the season is meant to be shared. Nice. You know, my parents always throw the most fabulous holiday soiree second weekend of December. It's next Friday, if by any chance you want to come. And that charity benefit's on Saturday. I just got too much going on around here. Won't be realistic. Why, what else have you got going on? You just couldn't sneak away for a day or two? Well, the next two weekends I have pageant rehearsals, and then during the week I have antiquing and set-building. And somewhere in there I have to figure out the Spring showcase. - What about the Winter musical? - That's not happening. It's just not worth fighting the city over again. Core. Wait, what do you mean it's not worth fighting the city over? I mean, if it's something that you love, it's worth fighting for. I've tried, it just costs way too much with the small amount of people who show up for them. Okay. So how about you start a new theater with your own private investors and then someone can run marketing to get more people in? It's just not that easy. Not all of us come from parents who throw soirees or... If that was the case, I definitely wouldn't be worried about losing my dad's store. Sorry. Will you excuse me? Was it something I said? Corey and her mom have had a really hard time keeping that place open for a while. They put everything they have into it, and all the money they got when her dad passed and the little money Corey makes here. They have some really great stuff in there that's worth some real money. Why don't they sell it? You know, I bet I could get someone in there that would pay a lot of money to take that entire place off their hands. That's all she has left of her dad. That's why she wouldn't move with me after college. When her dad passed, she just wouldn't leave. She couldn't. I'm gonna go check on her. Hey. You okay? I'm fine. I didn't mean to snap on him like that. He just doesn't get it. His life was clearly set up for him in a family trust, so why should I expect him to understand? Hey. Don't be like that. You don't know him that well yet. What you should know is that he really likes you. He's just trying to understand and be helpful is all. How do you even know he likes me? Please, don't think I didn't hear all about your reindeer rendezvous last night from Davey this morning. Apparently, Ryder wouldn't shut up about it. So we had a nice walk. So what? It still doesn't change the fact that he doesn't live here. And you're not leashed to a chain here, either, in case you forgot. I think you should at least tell him that you like him. They leave tomorrow. I mean, I'm sure he must know by now. No. Your poker face is on point. Everyone except me, of course. Of course. So what am I supposed to do now? You don't have to do anything. I will set the stage. She's incredible, huh? She's one of a kind. Hey, Corey... I'm sorry if I was insensitive back there. I didn't mean to be. I just... I see you... And I just want to help you. Why would you want to help me? Hi! Hi! I'm Mindy. Okay. All right. Goodnight, everybody. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Ryder. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Drive safe. I will. I'll miss you. Where did Jillian and Dave go? I don't know. Maybe someone forgot something. That's weird. Look's like it's about to snow again. Yeah, I'm not looking forward to driving back in it tomorrow morning. In fact, you know, it's not just because of the weather. I just wish we had more time together. Yeah. It is what it is, though, right? You live there, I live here, you have a career there and I have to take care of my dad's store here. Or maybe we can find some time to meet someplace in the middle. I don't know where that is. Well, maybe we just... Try to find it. - You... - Wait. No. No! - So if we put these up... - Okay. And I'm thinking, just decorate that one to look like this one. - Okay. - And hang one above each window. Hey-hey-hey! Well, look who's back. Good afternoon, Mrs. Calvin. I heard that you paid a pretty penny for that antique clock the other evening. I just want you to know we really do appreciate that. What can I say? I have a refined taste for quality. Then why'd you buy that old chair? Well, one man's old chair is another man's Christmas treasure. So, are you guys heading back this morning? Yes, ma'am, we are. I just, wanted to get one more Christmas gift. Excuse me, I'm, I'm looking for a Christmas present for my girlfriend. Something to hold her, her tacky antique necklaces. Could you tell me how much this is? Okay, look, I confess, it's actually for my mother. She kinda likes tacky jewelry, too. Come back to the city with me. - What? When? - Today. Tomorrow, after the holiday. As soon as you're able to. Ryder, I told you. I have commitments here. What would me coming to the city accomplish? It would just give us more time, to see what this is. Corey... How can you ignore what happened between us this weekend? What exactly happened between us? Our stars crossed. That's the thing about stars crossing. They don't stay together. I don't think you believe that. You're just worried that it's too late to change. But it's not. Change doesn't come so easy when you have this much to lose. I'm just inviting you to visit, to give us a few more days to, to see. I'm sorry... I can't. Hey. How did it go? We should get going. We're gonna hit traffic. Goodbye, Dorothy. Thanks for everything. Hello? Holiday fun to Corey Calvin. I'm good. I'm not hungry. Okay, that's not what I asked, and we already ordered. Are you okay? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? I don't know, maybe because you've been comatose and totally lame the past three days? I can't leave you tomorrow like this. Please. Don't be silly. I'm a big girl. I'll be fine. I think the only remedy for you is to come to LA with me this weekend. - You know I can't do that. - Oh, Corey. Come on, it'll be fun. You haven't visited me in almost two years. You owe me. And you owe a visit to your niece. I miss Delilah as much as I miss you, but I'm not going to LA just to visit your dog. Or you could come to visit Ryder. You know, I mean, you could tell him how you really feel since you chickened out last weekend. I can't. I have rehearsals. Well, which I'm sure Mindy'd be more than capable of covering for you. Let's just see what she says. See? Mindy says she can cover. Settled. You're comin'. Okay, so who's gonna close up the shop for my mom? Cole. Duh. Okay. Honestly, I'm scared. Do you remember when I moved to LA? Do you remember what you told me? - I said a lot of things. - Yes, you did. I was so scared because we were always supposed to do that move together. And I said, "what if I don't make it and I move only to find out that I failed? Or what if I do make it big and it totally changes me?" And you said, "Jillian, you are the bravest person I know. And no matter what you do, you will never fail me. And when you make it, if it changes you, I will always be here to remind you who you really are." You were the only person I trusted back then. Please, trust me now. I'm only asking for one weekend. Please come to the party with me. Thank you. Have you talked to my mom today? She hasn't been by. Yeah, said she was gonna stay home and work on your, Christmas gift. I'll bet it's a hand-sewn dress for the pageant. I'm not putting money against that. Do you know who this one's from? There's no name on the return address. Weird. Mom would love that. They look pretty nice. I'm gonna need you to watch the store while I'm gone. Okay? Can you do that? - Okay. - I'm sorry. Thank you. - You're going to LA, aren't you? - I owe you. What do you think? I don't know, is it too much? On you, mom, it's never too much. Here, come on. Try this. Here we go. This is so sweet of him. It's a very special gift. I think he's a very special young man. Let's take a look. Yeah. Yeah, it looks great. So what do I say when I see him? What do you say? Honey... You just be as honest with him as he's been with you. I don't even have a gift for him. I can help you. Mom. No. Honey, you said that he likes clocks, right? - Yes. - Okay. This has just been sitting around collecting dust, honey. Yeah. My sweet, sweet, sweet Delilah! Have you been a good girl? Look who I brought home as an early Christmas gift. Your aunt Corey. - Hi, my baby. - Thank you so much, Bernie. And I got a little early Christmas gift for you. - Your favorite dark chocolates. - Thank you. This place is adorable. It's like a little Winter Wonderland. Yeah, you can have one of your own, too, when you're a big famous director. Who wants some champagne? We do. Bernie, three glasses. Okay, I think that about does it for your friends in our department. That only leaves your parents. No, it's fine. I'll get 'em somethin' in Temecula this weekend. I mean, they're my parents. It should feel somewhat personal. Well, wine and cheese always seemed to do the trick for them, doesn't it? You know, maybe I'll get them a trip to wine country this year. Oh, right. Victoria called. Said she'd meet you at the airport at 7:00. Yeah, I'll shoot her a text soon. So last week you were planning on cancelling Temecula altogether, but now you've pulled it up a week? You're gonna be missing your parents' annual soiree and benefit to join her instead? What changed? It's nothing a couple of glasses of wine and a good massage from the Zortan Spa won't fix. I'm fairly sure. Okay. And one last thing. The holiday calendar shoot this afternoon. Are you still going? Not a chance. Tell them I have an early flight to catch, will you? Wait. So won't Ryder be here? He's in this shoot, too, right? He should be. I should think so. Okay. Thank you. Grab a seat. Go ahead, you have a seat right here. Get comfortable. So can I get you guys anything? I mean, maybe some Christmas cookies or how about some fresh-pressed lemon ginger with some turmeric? All the above, please. Okay. I'll be right back. I'm not part of the shoot. I'm just here for moral support. Oh, no, have Felicia do your hair and makeup. You might as well get it done now for the party tonight. - What party? - At the Donnelly estate. Hello? It is going to be spectacular! The annual soiree. That's right. This was your plan all along, wasn't it? To bring me here, fix me up. I love it. Yeah! Davey, hey! Corey. Hi. What are you doin' here? I came in last night with Jillian on a whim. Figured a little Christmas in the city might do me some good. We thought Ryder was gonna be here. Yeah, you know, he is actually in Temecula this weekend. That's... it's too bad. - I was kinda hoping I'd see him. - You know what... - Lemme see if I can... - No, no, no. You don't have to, you don't have to do that. I don't wanna change his plans and I didn't even tell him that I was gonna be here so that, you know, wouldn't be fair. Are you sure? It's super-easy, I... Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. But who did he go with? I thought his family was throwing a party here this weekend. That's why I came with Jillian. Yeah, it's a family friend. They bought a winery. Nice. Well, I guess it's too bad we're missing each other. - Have to catch him next time. - Yeah. - This is all fun, right? - Yeah. Yeah, she's been doing, she's been doing great. Yeah. Hi, honey. Come on, let's see it already. I love it. - So good. - Sorry. I couldn't bear to tear off the price tag. - It's so expensive. - I told you. It is a Christmas gift to you from me. And Delilah, of course. Well, thank you. It's very beautiful. But are you sure it's not too much? Corey, that dress was made for you to wear tonight. Trust me, you are gonna be the talk of the Christmas soiree. What do you think, Delilah? Is it too much? This place is unbelievable! I know, right? Can you believe Ryder grew up here? Actually, I can. I assume his parents are here somewhere at least. Well, they should be. Maybe they're out back. Let's do this first. - Yeah. - Hi. What's the Santa bag for? Well, every year, the Donnellys throw this soiree, a week before Christmas and they put that bag out so all their wealthy friends can, you know, throw a bunch of cash and checks in there, help them fund their big charity benefit. The one that's happening tomorrow? Well, someone's done her homework. Ryder told me. I just remembered. - What's the charity for, anyway? - I mean, it's not just one. No, they, they donate to a whole bunch of different charitable organizations. Soup kitchens, children's hospitals... Yeah, they raised over 200k last year. And that was before they put in their own personal donation. - It's incredible. - Yeah. I know. Yeah, they've been doing it for 16 years, ever since Ryder graduated high school. Yeah. Yeah, this whole thing was his idea, apparently. I guess he just didn't want gifts anymore, so he just, I don't know, guess he wanted a big benefit instead. Actually... shall we? How sweet. He didn't mention that. Oh, Davey! So glad you could come. And this must be Jillian Winters. Gary, come over here and say hello. I love your show. So nice to finally meet you. It's so lovely to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Donnelly. Your house is just perfection. This old thing? - Thank you. - Mr. Donnelly. Good to see you. - Good evening. - Hello there. It's good to see you. Honey, this is Jillian Winters. You remember, from the all-women superhero show I watch? Honey, I do remember. And this is my best friend, Corey. Nice to meet you, Corey. Welcome. Thank you. And thanks for having us. Your place is amazing. Wait there. Did you say Corey? Yeah. Ryder's Corey? Of course. Corey. We should have known that. We didn't know you'd be here. But she's exactly as we pictured. What exactly did he say? Well, you'll have to ask him yourself. We really embarrass him enough as it is. I mean, I would, but, if he were here and not out in wine country with his buddy... Wine country? What do you mean? Ryder's here tonight. No, no, no, I swear I had no idea. He must've stayed on his own. Ryder, dear, look who's here! What are you doing here? I wanted to thank you for this. You came all the way here to thank me for a necklace? This isn't just any necklace. This is Comet, Santa's most special reindeer. Is that so? No, Rudolph isn't Santa's most special reindeer? Well, comet knows the star system best, that's why they call her Comet and that's why she's Santa's most special reindeer. I did not know that when I found the necklace. Hi, Comet. And hi to you. This is a nice surprise. I was totally coerced. Can you come with me real quick? Yeah. So, who was Ryder going to wine country with? Victoria, right? Well, he must have cancelled on her. Wait, wait. Who's Victoria? You were right. Not very many stars. Not that you can see, anyway. Still, so many other beautiful things to see in this city. I've never been here at Christmas time. All the lights on Rodeo Drive, down Hollywood Boulevard. It still feels magical. If you look in the right places, I think you'll find Christmas just about everywhere. I owe you an apology for how I said goodbye to you last weekend. Corey, you don't owe me anything. You were right, I, we barely knew each other and I came on too strong. I don't think you came on too strong. I just... It scared me because I felt the same way. So what made you change your mind and decide to come? Well, whatever the reason... I'm really glad that you came. Likewise. I'm really glad you didn't end up going to wine country. What ended up happening with that, anyway? Well, my heart wasn't in leaving so close to Christmas and... I guess... Something was just telling me I should stay. So how long are you here for? Till first thing Monday morning. Wish I could stay longer, but... Still have lots to do for the pageant. Yeah. So who's running rehearsals this weekend? Mindy. And in exchange, I promised her your hand in marriage, with a big Christmas wedding to go along with it. Well, if I'm being betrothed to another woman, I should at least get a dance in while I can. Yeah? So this is the annual fundraiser Ryder's parents have every year? Yeah. It's actually my first time attending. Excuse me. Corey! It's so perfect! I'm so glad one of those fit you. It was so last second. And, Jillian, just darling. Thank you. Are the guys here yet? They're over by the tree. This way. I'll take you to them. Ryder showed me photos of your Art Center games. I hope you don't mind we found inspiration for ours. Of course not. This is perfect. Ryder also showed me a video clip he took of you directing a rehearsal at your center. You have a way with people. Now, I don't want to push, but I do have so many friends in the arts out here and I just know that I could get you a position in one of the best theaters. Maybe a director's assistant or something to start you out? My gosh, I... I don't know what to say. I'm so flattered. Say you'll think about it is all. Yes, I will. Thank you, Mrs. Donnelly. Oh, please, call me Mrs. Claus. Hey! What's shakin', sugar plum? Doin' swell, Santa's helper. Can you take a photo of us? - Yes, sure. - Yeah, here. I got a camera... Why, Prancer! I didn't know you'd be here today. For the record... I'm Rudolph, okay? Also, for the record, I don't think you've ever looked quite this cute before. Well, suppose cuteness doesn't come as easily for all of us as it does for you. Hey... How about I take a break from this and we play some games? Entertain the masses. - Shall we? - Sounds good. Ooh, nice! Come on. - Yeah! - Yay! Thank you so much for coming. Bye. Merry Christmas. Good job. Cheese! - Ryder, hey. - Hi. What's up? I heard about Victoria. - Yeah. - Are you interested in her? Davey says no, but I just need to hear it for myself. No. No, Victoria is just a family friend. Her parents buy properties from my family. She's not my girlfriend. But, yes, we did go out once, and, yes, she still has a thing for me. And you were going to wine country together. To see a property for her parents. That's all. There's nothing more. Fine. Fine. But I think you should tell Corey. It's not something I wanna keep from her, and I really don't think you should, either. Also, your mom offered to help Corey get a job here. And between you and I, I think she might actually consider it. So don't mess this up. Okay. - I'll see you. - Okay. She said a friend of hers at some big LA theater can get me a job, like, now. - Well, so what did you say? - I said, "thanks." But, I mean, I can't just take a job in the city. Corey, with everything that's going on here at the Art Center, I'm thinkin' maybe, maybe you oughta give this a try. Just for a little bit. I mean, it doesn't mean you have to move there permanently just yet. But you wanna retire in the Spring and... I already told you, I'm not just leaving the shop. But, honey, you've got to admit, with this timing, it's kinda like a sign. Maybe a little Christmas miracle. Sweetheart, the most important thing to me that I need... Is just for you to be happy. Thanks, mom. I actually have to go now, mom. But, can I call you a bit later? Sure, you can. And, Corey... - I love you. - Love you, too. Hey! Holiday greeting card for the win! That's pretty amazing. I'll send it to you. I just realized I don't have your number. Will you... There you are. Become our weekend tradition. I actually have something for you, too. What is this? Hope it's not a box full of coal. I don't know. You'll have to open it. Well... well, this is... It's incredible, Corey, really, it... Where did you even get this? It was one of my dad's old watches. It was just sitting in a box collecting dust. I can't accept this. Listen, a semi-wise man once said, "if you possess something that's perfect and unique, you don't just leave it on a shelf to collect dust. You put it out there and share it for the world to see." So, really, I want you to have it. And it's also from my mom, too. Corey... I wanna... Talk to you about me going to wine country this weekend. I almost didn't mention it 'cause it's not really even a thing, but... At the same time, I mean, just to, just to be clear, I wanted to let you know that... That the reason actually was... Hey! There they are! We were lookin' everywhere for you guys. Hey, guys. What's goin' on? Yeah, nothing real... What exactly is going on? Victoria, what are you doing here? - I thought you went to Temecula. - Yes, I did. And I thought someone was going to meet me there. Corey, this is Victoria, an old family friend. Who he was supposed to be taking to wine country this weekend. Yeah, to look at a property that her family is going to buy. Okay, you know, I'm not helping myself standing here listening to this nonsense. The deal is off! Corey, look, I... Look, the only reason I considered going down there in the first place was to get my mind off of you. I was not going for her, with her or anything like that. I... I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here. Corey. Corey! I can't believe I was stupid enough to buy into this silly fantasy. Corey, nothing has changed. Gayle still wants to get you a job here, and you can stay here with me until you get on your feet for as long as you need. This can be our place together. It's not about the job. This whole thing has been a sign that I need to go home to my mom and my dad's shop. That's where I belong. Corey, do not run away from your dreams again. Listen... I hope you have the best Christmas in the big city with your new boyfriend. I'll text him when I'm home safe and sound, okay? Oh, honey. Son... Come on, what has it been, a week? Right? Give her a call. She doesn't wanna talk to me, dad. She made that clear the first twenty times she didn't answer. Anyway, I'll try to finish up early, okay? I'll see you this evening. - Hey, Corey. - Hey, Cole. You doin' all right? I'm okay. Thanks for asking. I'm excited about the pageant tomorrow night. Yeah? I am, too. I think it'll be nice. Hey, you know, if he's not wise enough to see how amazing you are, he doesn't deserve you anyhow. Thanks, Cole. You're a good friend. All right, let's go inside. Okay. Okay, what happened this weekend while I was in rehearsals, you two? Some antiquarian trader from LA came up here yesterday and he bought all this stuff. Paid enough to cover our expenses for the next six months, at least. - That's wonderful news! - Yeah, it is. I guess this means the shop's gonna stay open a little bit longer now, isn't it? Cole, would you give me a hand with that? It's kinda heavy. Wait, did the trader say how he found out about us? No. No. What's this? Just a little thank you for the best boss in the whole world. You can't open until Christmas, though. Okay, fine. It's an expensive tie. - Thank you, D. You're the best. - Oh, my goodness! That old watch is absolutely exquisite! Where did you get that? It's another very nice and very priceless gift. What are you still doin' here, anyway? Get outta here! Go spend time with your husband, your little rug rats. - It's Christmas. - Okay, okay. No need to tell me twice. Oh, and Smith called. Said he loved the stuff he found out at that old store you recommended. Said he can't wait for y'all to start doin' some trading. That's good to hear. Thanks, Deanna. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. Hey! Still haven't fixed it, huh? It's not fixable. I give up. Oh, come on! That's not the Ryder I know. The Ryder I know would be chomping at the bit to fix anything that was broken and he wouldn't stop until he did it, especially, if he found out that his best buddy and Ms. Jillian were, perhaps, heading back to Harmony tomorrow for a little Christmas Eve pageant. And, you know, he thought he might be able to tag along and fix something he'd broken out there. I've tried, Davey. She doesn't wanna talk to me. And she doesn't wanna leave the life that she has there. It's too late. It's done. Is it? Because as far as I'm concerned, the only place where time has stopped... Is right here. You know, your father had another woman in his life when I met him, too. Dad had a girlfriend when you guys met? Well, no, not exactly. There was this girl that he was crazy about, though. She was... I don't know, kind of sweeter and kind of softer and... Kind of a lot like you are now, actually. - What? - Yeah. Your dad and I were just friends. We were workin' down at the old chop house before the place closed. So then what happened? Well... That girl got engaged. She got married. She moved away, I think. Yeah. And then? Well, and then... I had your father right where I wanted him. He asked me to marry him a year later. I had no idea. Yeah, well, there's really no such thing as a perfect love story, you know? I mean, we have to see the signs and we have to listen to our hearts. And, sometimes, we even have to wait our turns. I mean, after all, timing is everything. But your dad and me... We had a great run, didn't we? You're gonna be all right, you know that? Yeah, I know. Look! Look at that one! I think it went right through yours. Hey. This was left at the shop for you this morning. So nice to have everyone here this Christmas Eve. And thank you all so much for coming. It's funny, when I was thinking back to all the Christmas Pageants I've done, I think it's been five years now. As some of you already know, my dad passed away six years ago and after that, our shows here soon became the one place I knew I could escape the heartache, if only just for a while. It's been like my second home. And I can't thank the city of Harmony enough for allowing me to share these stories on stage. It's been the one place that I felt safe to share my art with all of you. But, sadly, it's also been the one place I knew I could play it safe. My dad always used to say, "dream big in anything that you do. What kind of card you want, dream big." Or, "you're not gonna put whipped cream in your hot chocolate? Come on, dream big." More recently, someone else said to me, "look, if you possess something that's perfect and unique, you don't hide it away to collect dust on a shelf. You put it out there and share it with the world." In that moment I knew it was true... And he was right. And with that said, it is with a heavy heart that I share, this is my last Christmas Pageant here at the center. I've still got some big dreams I wanna share with the world, and with all of you. But Harmony will always be my first home... And the first place I learned to dream big. Merry Christmas, everyone. Thank you. Okay, that was beautiful, and I cried, but you can't go! Besides, who's gonna run this place when you're gone? These kids will destroy me. Mindy, this place will be in great hands. And Cole can help you out if you help him with his online courses. Yeah, but what about the shop next Summer after your mom retires? The shop will also be in great hands, right? - What's in the bag? - My dad's old clock. Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? For those of you that don't know, my name is Jillian Winters, and I performed at this holiday pageant every year growing up. But this Christmas I didn't think I was gonna be able to be here, that is, until a dear old friend of mine reminded me what matters most this time of year. Thank you. - You were fabulous! - Thank you so much. - Hi! - Hi! Say hello to your mom from me, okay? Merry Christmas. It's so good to see you. Thank you for coming. So that trader that cleared out half our stock... That was you, wasn't it? We're gonna start a little joint venture, I think. Thanks to you. And Victoria? She apologized. So I introduced her to my fellow antique trader. They're in wine country spending Christmas with her parents. Okay. So where is next for you? I can't say I know exactly where it is, but I can tell you it's out of my comfort zone. That is, of course, if you and LA and the possibilities will still have me. Well, I'm almost positive that there's still a job offer for you in the city. My mom did say it was a standing offer. But I am 100 percent certain... That you are the only person I wanna spend my Christmases with... For many, many years to come. Well, then I guess it's Christmas here and a lifetime with you there. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
