Distribution FRENETIC FILMS Z?RICH A THOUSAND OCEANS Come on, boy! Come on, you go first. Welcome to the company! Thanks. Ladies and Gentlemen, it's a pleasure for me to introduce my junior partner, my son, Michael Willer. You have the floor. Thank you once again. Everything I know about cars I have learnt from my father. Ulrich gave me the best possible education. Again, thank you. I can take over part of the responsibility for the family business. And now we can start on the buffet. - Can I have a word with you? - Yes. What's the matter? Tell me. Nothing. It's all going a bit too fast for me. - You're scared of the responsibility. - I'm only 24. You've had two, three years to prepare for this day. Wait a minute. - What's up? - Oh, it's all so stressful. - Now what? - Hello, boss. You're looking smart. - Yes. Thanks. - Like a petty bourgeois, actually. Yes, I'm the Junior Boss now, after all. What's my suitcase doing there? Your suitcase? Oh, yes, the suitcase. It's your lucky day! You're crazy?! - What? Today? - In six hours, we'll be on a plane. - Tomorrow morning, on the beach. - Have you gone mad? - I can't get away now. - What? - Impossible, I have to stay here. - What do you have to do? - Well I ... Right now, I can't even ... - Meikel, come here. - Look at that. Your choice: that... - Yes. or the beach. That... or the beach. - All right then! - Good, there we go! Let's go. Come on. Meikel. Anybody can just go. - Yes. - Yes? Then off we go! Go on in, go on. Just look at them, the champagne-slurping prats! That'd be great! Shit! Right now, or what. - We're really nuts. - Sure, we're crazy. - Beer? - Sure. What? Bloody wanker! - Back home, it will soon be winter. - I like snow. Then you are in the right place here. Do you have sun cream? - The beer! - The beer, the beer! We might meet up sometime. Bye! - Ciao, Tom. - Ciao. Bye! See you soon, maybe. She's sweet, the small dark one. - What was her name again? - Rahel! Are you happy here? Yes ... very. Why are you working with your old man? You'd have made a good vet. You think so? I know it. He needs me. He's not that fit. He drinks. I'm going to kip down. - Okay, see you tomorrow? - See you tomorrow. Come. We have to. Now come on. We have to get going. The plane won't wait. We don't have time! I'm staying here. What? - Sit down. - What d'you mean, you're staying here? Look. I have everything I need here. Water or what? Come on. Don't be so daft, we can always come back. I decided early this morning. So many people only talk about it. I'm staying here. Come now. Come on! All right, then stay there! - What are you doing there? - I'm swimming. And why in my swimming pool? - Because I need to cool off. - Who are you? Bj?rn, the seal. Help me out, help me. - Are you crazy? - Sometimes. Really cool! Sorry. Tired? - Yes, very. - Because of the jet lag. You fly away and skip an eternity. You need a lot of fluids. Thank you. Most people don't drink enough. And what's your name? Mei... well Michael, but everyone calls me Meikel. Looking forward to going home? Yes, I guess. That is, I'm not sure they're looking forward to having me back. And how was your holiday? Holiday? I am not on holiday, I'm on duty. - On duty? - Yes. I am a doctor. Hi, bro. What are you doing here? - Came to fetch you. - You had no idea where I was! Well then, tell me. - I was in God's bathtub. - Come on, give over. - And where is that? - You don't need to know everything. Freak, how did you find out? They must be worried, surely. Why did you come back? Because I was on a charter flight. Hello! There. How are you? Where did you find those? Back there, by the motorway. Its foot is broken. Can you fix it? Hello! Hey, now what! I've brought you a present. Hello! Oh! I missed you. Here, seashells. - For my collection? - Yes. Ah, thank you. Here, I've got something for you too. Where've you been then? On a tiny island in the Maldives. It was wonderful. Crystal-clear water, white sand ... I was there with Bj?rn. But he's not back yet! What? How do you know? Susanne called me. Did you have a fight? No, he just wanted to stay on longer. Well, you know him. You bet! He just does his own thing. - Look, I'm really sorry, okay? - What? - What exactly are you sorry for? - I had to getaway. See something of the world. And? Was what you saw good? I have to go back and get Bj?rn. No way you're going back, d'you hear me? We need you here. We told everyone you were ill. We should tell him the truth. - It's too early to do that. - What would you tell him then? Nothing at all. You know why he stayed there, don't you? So? You're not allowed to tell me, right? I'm going to fetch him. No, don't do that. Bj?rn Holm can't take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. Thanks. Well, amigo, you missing me already? Please call me back, okay? - There you go. - Thank you. - They're all black. - But a beautiful black. What did you photograph? Nothing black, that's for sure. What on earth is that? Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. - Where would you like to go? - To the Maldives, as soon as possible. Okay, let me see. Edelweiss flies there on Saturdays and Mondays. Saturday is already booked up. I still have a few seats free Monday. Any particular island? Yes, but I don't remember the name. I'd have to see it. - That's the one. - The Cocoa Resort. We are not doing that one any more. The island is barred to visitors. Why? Excuse me! You are the doctor, aren't you? On the plane? You were also in the Maldives. Give me the ... - No, look! - Close the door. Give ... give me that! Stop, wait a minute. Hush! Your father is asleep. - What are you doing? - Look. People loved her. Stop that! Stop that! Wake up! I've got to talk to you. Why did you close down the business? Tell me! I did apologise, didn't I? Don't be like that! You too must have had cock-ups in the past! I asked you something! What's the matter with the two of you? What's the matter with you? I'm going to make tea for you, okay? I don't want tea! I need water. Why didn't you tell me that the old man had closed down the firm? What's going on here? Come with me. Get lost! Both of you! You look tired. This bloody jet lag will kill me. Crackers? But water. Please. How long have you been interested in medicine? I'm comparing the human brain with that of flies. - What did you find out? They have one? - Yes. A fly can only remember something for 0.7 seconds. It flies at a window-pane and shortly afterwards forgets - why its head is hurting. Super, eh? - Yes. Sounds familiar. What on earth is that? Tell him. - What's in those boxes? - Sick animals. - Yes, they'll all have to go. - No! You mustn't do that! Now just hang on, young man. You're going home. This minute. Got it? Gosh, did you startle me! - How did you manage to get in? - Through the door. - But it was locked. - No. Has Papa been here yet? - No. Why? - He wanted to drop in sometime. - What have you got there? - A map. Give it to me. I couldn't find this island anywhere on the Net. But how can that be? According to the brochure, it does exist. I went to the travel agency, and they said the island is barred. I don't get it. - Perhaps there were complaints. - Complaints? - Too many sharks. How should I know? - Too many sharks. What rubbish. Must be just about here. Here. Cocoa Island. And now? And now a beer. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Mama is not feeling too good. - What? What do you mean? Hello! You can't start saying something and just leave. Where are you going? Wait! What's wrong with you?! - Let go of me! - Tell me what's up with Mama. - Leave me alone! - Why can't you just tell me? What have I done to you? Eric! Hey! ONE WEEK EARLIER Do you know what you're going to say tomorrow? - No idea. - A little nervous, eh? Meikel, you're a grown-up now. Come, let's get on with this. The warranty. Works guarantee. Twelve years guarantee for the body against rust. Three years guarantee for the paintwork. D'you think you could stop that? Will you need a microphone tomorrow? All the staff will be there. All of them. Can he decide that for himself? - I'm talking to Michael just now. - All right, Papa. I'll leave you alone for a bit, okay? My mug! What d'you want to be when you grow up? - A vet. And you? - I just want to grow up. - I'm jumping in. You're coming? - No. Yes, you have the floor. - When she comes back, it'll be winter. - I like snow. D'you have sun cream? Can I have some too? We have to intubate. You need lots of fluids. How are the others? Your son's cerebral cortex is severely damaged. - He has fallen into a vegetative coma. - What does that mean? It's a kind of retreat into his innermost being. Vegetative coma patients retain a sleep/wake cycle. Your son's eyes are open, although he can no longer respond actively. For medicine, the apallic syndrome, as we call a vegetative coma, is still a subject which raises many questions and riddles. - What's happening to him? - We speak of an oceanic experience. Sometimes, patients are closer to surface, then they sink again into their innermost self. But their fundamental needs for love, respect and protection are exactly the same as for us healthy people. When will he wake up? If your son wakes up, we will have to reckon with medium to severe neurological deficits. Your son may possibly turn his head in response to acoustic and optical stimuli. It could happen that his face and eyes take on a fearful expression. Why fearful? It is a psychomotor disorder. A kind of inner stress. He will probably also wriggle and kick sometimes. Will he come back? That depends very much on how you define the word "back". Let's go in. Please. Hello! Leave us alone. Where are you? Brother. You can't move. What d'you mean? Of course I am moving. You had a very had car accident. Car accident... No joke. It's true. You've got a sick sense of humour, boy. Bj?rn is dead. - What did you say? - Bj?rn is no longer alive. - What idiotic rubbish you talk! - There is no island. Let me tell you something. There is an island. - You've been in hospital for days. - Shut up! You're living in a fantasy world! I'm leaving now. Let me go! We've been considering starting therapy with animals as soon as possible. Animals can fight for the life of a patient. They have a sensitivity which is different to us humans. A little bell around a dog's neck will provide an auditory stimulus, so the patient not only feels it, but also hears it. Well, fatso! Where do you come from? And you too. Hey you! Wait a minute! Why are you doing that to yourself? It comforts me. Car accidents are not meaningless. They're part of life. They give people back their feelings. I love you, Meikel. I can't just leave him behind! Bj?rn is dead. And I? Where are we? We're very close. He won't let me go. What are you doing here? Bj?rn is fine. Let go of him. I need him. But he doesn't need you. - Where d'you want to go? - Let me go. - Where are you going? - You should just let me go! You can't help me anymore. What? What? What? What? What do you want? I ... - Get in. - Leave me. Leave me alone! What do you want from me? Why should I stay here? How are you? He's in this bloody bed because of you. That's quite enough! I got Meikel to join the firm. This morning we found out that your son had developed pneumonia. As a rule, we treat it immediately. - We administer antibiotics. - Why do you say as a rule? Some relatives take such an illness as an opportunity to see whether the patient still has the strength and the will to fight it on his own. If the patient hasn't left instructions, it is up to the relatives to decide what the patient would have wanted. Will he be on medication? I didn't want any of this. You are my children and I love you! Hello! Hello! Hello!
