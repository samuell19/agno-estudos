[mechanical noises] JAMES MONROE: You're about to spend some time with my sister's husband and the father of their four, lovely children. His name is Pepper Morales. Pepper's name was originally Pepe. But when he was a youngster, he became a fast rising baseball star, and his teammates kept calling him Pepper. I'm Jaimie-- uh, James Monroe, an attorney at law. And I can't understand Pepper. He has a good job, a lovely family, but he's never satisfied. He dreams all the time about having a business of his own. I keep giving Pepper free legal advice hoping that he'll settle down soon. He should. My sister's expecting another child, and she worries too much about her husband, especially now that Pepper has that greeny look in his eyes. [music playing] Hey, Tom. [speaking spanish] Oh, oh, Pepe. Oh, oh. What are you doing home so early? I'm not going to tell you. No. Pepe, there you are. Don't fix no dinner tonight. But what are we-- We're going to have a celebration. We're going to have a celebration. I'll see you later. Pepe, Pepe. [speaking spanish] [music playing] Is that the taxi? Oh, don't say that. Do you like it? Come on. Everybody get in the cab. Let's go for a ride. [music playing] Come on. Everybody get dressed up. We're going out to celebrate. A hot dog? Do you want anything on it? Barley mustard. Just a little mustard. Becky, what do you want to have? I want cheeseburger with a hot dog. Cheeseburger with a hot dog. Can she eat all of that? Do you want to get her-- No, no, no, no, no. Give her a cheeseburger. Cheeseburger. Now, Tommy, now you want a cheeseburger, right? A jumbo hamburger. A jumbo hamburger with ketchup. Jimmy, you want-- you want chicken? I saved a long time for my business. Got to see I have twins. Give me a break, just one kid this time. I love my kids. Here we are, celebration. I got a chicken dinner for myself. That's for Danny. Right. OK. [dog barking] [music playing] Taxi. Downtown to the border is $7.50. Airport to the hotel is $1.50, $1 a quarter. Taxi? Taxi. Taxi. Yes, sir. Yes. I can take you there right away. First time in San Diego? Oh, that's our zoo on the left. It's a very, very beautiful zoo. Oh, you'll like it. Yes. That's $1 and a half, sir. Well, I'm in business for myself, so I can afford to do it for less. $1 tip. Thank you very much, sir. [music playing] BILL GORDON [ON RADIO]: Weather forecast for Saturday [inaudible] areas is about the same as it is all the time, around 70, 75 degrees. The ocean temperature around 63, that will be a little cold to dip your tootsies in. Here it is long about four minutes before 7 o'clock in the morning. And in about four minutes we will hear the latest news. This is Bill Gordon on Hit Radio 76. That's the spirit of San Diego. [singing] KFMV San Diego. KFMV in San Diego, California overlooking the-- [music playing] Hey, you guys want a taxi? No thanks. Oh, come on. A taxi is better than a bus. How much does your bus cost you? 75 cents. I'll take you there for 60 cents. Yeah. Come on. Get in. Hey, Bob. Hey, come on, now. Hey. Taxi fellas. Hey, man. How you doing, Bob? Hey, come on. Get in. I'll give you a ride. Come on. Let's go. Now, in about maybe three weeks or something, I can get you set up in a cab, Bob. You're never going to make it. You're never going to make it, Pepper. Why am I not going to make it? What do you no, man? What do you know? What do I have to know? I see a guy in a corner that wants a ride. I take him somewhere. You pick somebody up, you need a city map first. Big business is going to put you down. What the heck are you talking about, Tony? You go out you can talk all this talking about movements. But, man, what are you really doing? You're working for the anglers just like everybody else. I just want to know how hard things are going to be for you, man? So you made a couple of bucks. Right. And I've just been working for three weeks. And I'm not no slave in a factory. TONY [VOICEOVER]: You're never going to make it, Pepper. Big business is going to put you down, man. I've got a surprise. Look at this. Baby. What do you think of that? I saw it was only car. That is so many. -No. No. We got only one car. But that's the company. That's what the company's going to be. Can't be sure, but that's my idea of the whole company. President. Yeah, well, it's my company, so I'm president. You see, what I'm going to do is I want to get one of these guys, Leo, Jimmy, Tommy, and Bob working for me, I think maybe in the next few months. We keep making money. What I'd like to do is have popcorn in the taxis. You know what I mean-- sell popcorn? What's the matter? Don't you like the idea? -Yeah. -No. It's a good idea. -I like it, but-- Look, what do they make the most? --[inaudible] to have the popcorn in the car? That's easy. You just have a few bags in the front seat. Somebody gets in. You hand them a bag of popcorn. Maybe you sell it for 10 cents, a quarter, something like that. Maybe they give you a bigger tip. Then I keep the rest of it in the trunk. A Cadillac is big. And to drink and all that? Drink? I don't know. That's-- Too much? Yeah. I can do some enchiladas. Hey, That's not a bad idea. Maybe I could have lunch, sell a little lunch. Also, maybe I'll put some television, a TV set in there too. -Like a little house. -Yeah. Anyway, that's it. On the other side, I started before. It didn't work out too good, but it's pretty nice though, isn't it? Nice. Your dream is coming true. I hope so. Pepe. You know, we waited a long time. And now I think we're going to have it for you and me. I want to go someplace. Where do you want to go? To Mexico. Mexico City? -Mm-hm. -OK. OK. [knocking at door] Jaimie. Hello, Pepper. Maria. That's for you. Oh, thank you. Hey, Uncle Jaimie, how are you? Tommy, how are you? Jimmy, I have a couple of presents for you. Let's see. I have a genuine, plastic compass here so that you never get lost, Jimmy. And Tommy, for you I have this year. It's a brand new yo-yo. A little later I'll teach you how to play with it, huh? Becky, come here, Danny. Come on. Come here. Come up here. Come here, son. That's it. How are you? I got a couple of gifts for you. Uncle Jaimie has a couple of gifts. All right. First, here's what we have for you, a beautiful little doll for you. And Danny, Danny, look what I have for you. I have a little car for you. And this is my flower, right? Do you want it? You can have it. You want it? You can keep that. All right, sweetheart? Listen, go over there with your mother, just for a few minutes. I want to relax here for a while. That's a girl. That's it. That's it. What's this nonsense about you quiting the factory? Well, I got my cab now. I don't need a factory anymore. And you're driving it now? -Yeah. -Illegally, of course? Yeah. I've been driving for about a week. What? Illegally, of course? No, I got a driver's license and everything. Do you have a permit? Yeah. Yeah. What kind of permit? A permit from the city to operate the cab. No. I'm going to get that soon, though. I think I'll get that pretty soon. Well, you realize the police going to stop you at any time and confiscate the cab and take you into custody. No. Nobody's going to bother me. Yes, they can. You're driving the cab illegally. You understand me? -Sure. But-- You dummy. If you persist on driving the cab, do you want me to tell you how I can do it legally? Yeah. I'd like to know about that. All right. First of all, you need to go to the city hall. You need to get a permit. They examine the car to see if there's any mechanical defects. And while they're examining the car, of course, the police will be examining you to see if you have a prior police arrest record. -I don't-- -I know. I know that. You're my sister's husband and I know about your moral turpitude. You needn't tell me anything about that. My what? Now, you're also going to need, of course, a taxicab meter. That's going to cost you $300. No. I don't need a meter, you see, because I just figure out-- Are you going to listen to me? Sure. Please, I'm here to advise you. I'm your brother-in-law. You're going to need a taxicab meter, which will cost about $300 to $400. You're going to need a two-way radio so that someone can communicate with you and tell you where to pick up passengers. And most importantly, of course, you're going to need $50,000 worth of carrier insurance on the taxicab. That's in the event that someone in the cab is injured while you're driving. In conclusion, let me dispense with the legalities involved in acquiring a taxicab franchisee in the city. Let me state simply that as a husband of my beautiful sister, Maria, and also as the father of these wonderful children, the most important thing here is the welfare of these people. That's what we're concerned about. Take my advice. Give up this silly idea and go back to the factory, please. [music playing] Give it up and go back to your job. Go back to the factory. I'm thirsty. Oh, gosh. I'm so hungry. I wish we'd get somewhere we could eat. This is a fantas-- What's this? Pepper Cola? I've never heard of it. Let's try some. And Pepper Popcorn. Oh, Janet, you're not going to believe this. Oh, they have this popcorn. What a great way to run a cab. Yeah. [inaudible]. Oh, Pepper Cola, Pepper Popcorn, and Pepper-tastic. Oh, my god. [music playing] Lady, hey, I don't think you ought to take your clothes off in my taxi. Sorry about that, but keep driving. [inaudible]. All right. All right. You know you can get in a lot of trouble doing that. Right. OK, lady, here we are. Take me across the border. Oh, no, no, no. I don't go up to Tijuana. Please take me across. This is the address. It's in Tijuana. I don't go to Tijuana. It's against my policy. I just don't do it. I'm sorry. OK. Wait a minute. You going to pay me? Hey, where are you going? Look, here's $20. What I want you to do is stay right here and wait for me til I come back. I may be gone two hours, maybe even four. But I don't want you to move. If you have to go to the head, down drive 50 miles away somewhere. Go to the one across the road. OK? Yeah, sure. You sure you'll understand? Yeah, yeah. Sure. And you'll stay? Yeah. OK. [crying] Thank you. Hey lady, uh, your bag. You dropped something out of it. I found it. $50. I almost forgot to give it to you. [engine overheating] Yeah, we ain't going nowhere. It's burning up. You got any tools, Bill? Yeah. Sorry about that. Sorry, buddy. Listen, fellas, I'm sorry to bother your work. You want that? OK. You going to eat? Wait a minute. I ate an onion. You ate an onion? Mm. Becky. It's good. What did you put in these things anyway? MARIA: Olive. What? MARIA: Olive, cheese. It's pretty good actually. MARIA: Ah, thank you. You're welcome. [inaudible] Where? PEPPER: Yeah, it did. Where? When we went camping. We'll go again sometime, OK? Pepper, the taxi company is a good business? Oh, yeah. You think we're going to have enough money to have a new house? PEPPER: Oh, yeah. Sure. MARIA: Wait a minute. BECKY: I ate an onion. PEPPER: You ate an onion. Mm. MARIA: Also-- Yeah. You can buy the license and the meter? The meter for the car. You don't have to worry about no meter. Nothing like that. I get-- I'm going to get that one, you know, soon. Suppose something happened to the taxi. PEPPER: Yeah? You can come back to other place to work? Nothing's going to-- I mean, it broke down today. OK. You know, I fixed it. I can fix it. Don't worry about it. But darling, remember something. We are six. PEPPER: Yeah. And one more [inaudible]. There's nothing wrong with the taxi businesses. It's better than the factory where all he does is-- You know something? I'm going to put you in a cab someday. What about what Jaimie says? Huh? What does Uncle Jaimie say? SON: Well, you know about all the stuff you gotta have for your cab. The meters, the insurance, all that money. Anything can happen. So-- I don't know. Look, if you have an accident-- Who you been talking to? Jaimie. Now wait a minute. Who-- what-- is-- is-- is Jaimie running the house or am I the head of the house? That's what I want to know. Who is it? Me or is it Jaimie. Now, you're all talking to him. You're not talking to me. Why don't you talk to me, huh? [crash] Look, the last time we took your taxi, it took us two hours to get where we was going. It only takes 30 minutes to go with a bus. Yeah, I know, but I got it all fixed up. And I'll get you there in 20 minutes. I promise you. And you can't beat the rate. $0.60 apiece, fellas. Come on. Well, what do you say, boys? All right. Yeah, come on. Let's go. [engine trouble] [car stalling] Hey, uh, you guys want a taxi? Oh, come on. A taxi is better than the bus. I'll take you there for $0.60. I really want to get it running smooth, Rob. What will it take? Well, we'll have to tear the engine down, regrind the valves, replace the rings, pistons. We'll have to rebuild the carburetor, the exhaust pipe, the power steering. We'll have to, uh, replace all the gaskets and probably replace the transmission. Well, uh, hey-- [clears throat] what do think-- what do you think that's going to cost? Well, man. I don't know. I know I need to talk to Gus about that. Yeah. Wait a minute. Where is he? Hey, Gus? -Yes, Pepper? -Hey listen-- Hi. How much is this going to cost me? Oh, don't worry about the price. -You'll give me a break on it? -Of course. On everything. It's a lot of work, you know. Of course. Hey, you know what you do need? With that taxi, you should have some tires. Let me show you these tires that I've got. This tire was just waiting for you, man. That's a beautiful tire. How much is it? Oh well, don't worry. Don't worry? I mean, I've got to know. Where'd you get this? Oh, we have the frames. Can you get me a taxi? [whistle] [whistle] What the hell are you putting them in there for? I was the first cab in line. What are you talking about? PEPPER: Taxi? -Hey, man. -What are you-- No, no. Don, John-- -Will you-- I told you before. Wait a minute. I got a ride. I can take somebody in my cab. [shouting] I got a cab. Max, vamanos. I told you before. Taxi! Taxi. [car horn] Hey man. I'm just turning around, man. Come on. Will you back up and let me turn around? Hey! Hey, lady! I got it. That's just another yellow cab. Come on. Will you move it back, please? It only cost me a fare. Hi, is this a taxi here? I've got to go to the airport. [SHOUTING] Hey, move back. I've got to go to the airport. Careful. Look, you can go that way. It's all right. -I can't go that way. Come on, I've got about 12 minutes. That's the garage. [SHOUTING] Come on, move back. Hey, it's that way. You go right through the-- I live here. I know where I'm going. Go right through the garage and turn right. Do you mind if I eat a banana or something? Just you go in here. I don't know which was is-- PEPPER: I get out this way? PASSENGER: No, I think it's over there. You're kidding with this place, right? PASSENGER: Oh, that's the exit on the street. See? Exit. OK. What is this? PEPPER: What kind of a pull trick is this? PASSENGER: Oh, come on. Don't make jokes on me. I've got to make this airplane. What is this? It's like a Disney Land thing here. What? What is this? Where are we going? PEPPER: I think it's the way out. PASSENGER: We started out on the street floor, right? PEPPER: Yes, sir. PASSENGER: So where are you taking me in the up? I have to go-- where's the street? Where is-- turn left, turn left, turn left, turn left. No, no, no. I'm sorry.

PEPPER: I think that the way to the airport is over here. PASSENGER: The way to the airport-- yeah, to the right. To the airport. Turn the other way! For god sakes, what do I have to do to get you to make a left turn? Nine minutes. Come on. Listen, I think the airport is the other way. [brakes screeching] PASSENGER: Bananas are very healthy for you. [car honking] PASSENGER: I got 12 minutes to make this plane now. I get very nervous. Have you got anyplace you can put this? Oh, thank you very much. PASSENGER: Oh, [bleep] I'm hungry. Well, I get nervous, you know? I mean, I work in an office, a collection agency. Poor people. I have to call them up, and find them, and take their money. It's just terrible. They blame it all on me. Me. And all day long I'm eating. So I eat. Bananas is what I like to eat. And the more eat, the fatter I get. The fatter I get, I got to go on a diet, right? So I'm on a diet. The doctor gave me pills to take away the appetite. So it takes away the appetite, but the pills make me nervous. When I get nervous, I eat. [brakes screeching] What are you stopping for? PEPPER: I-- I-- got to-- [car honking] I have to make that [beep] plane. That's the red light. I-- I-- I-- PASSENGER: It was yellow. Don't miss the [beep] damn plane, all right? Do me a favor. I'll give you a big tip. Don't miss it. Now, let's go. PEPPER: OK. OK. Now, I don't mean to yell at you, you know. You want a Twinkie? They're good. No look, the next corner turn right. That way?

All right, go there. Get the car from here to there. PEPPER: Yes, sir. PASSENGER: I want to make that airplane. I want to make the air plane. You want a Twinkie? Yup.

Why don't you go back to the factory like I told you to? That's where you belong. The factory. You've heard a lot about a generation gap. You and I seem to have a communication gap. I talk to you in good common sense and you answer me in good common stupidity. I don't know. I'm concerned about Maria and the children. [buzzer] Let's face it. You're not for business. I told you not to disturb me. I'll take it. Hello? Yes, sir. Ah, yes, sir, Mr. Stevens. Yes sir, sir. This is James Monroe. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm terribly sorry about that. I um-- yes, sir.

He has his fingers in a lot of pies in the city. He might know where it is or something? I don't know if he has any information about whether there's a car smuggling ring around here or not. But just present him this card. And tell him that James Monroe is your brother-in-law. James Monroe. Man, that's a good American name. That beats Jaimie Torres. MAN: You pull into some junk yard, and you'll find that car. You can bet your bottom dollar. I'll give you odds on that. Hey maybe-- maybe you know some contacts. You know, people who steal things or something like that. You know-- Our kind of guys I know-- I told you, they wouldn't touch that kind of car. But I could pay some money, you know? Hey, that's not the point. I'm telling you. I don't know the kind of people that would touch that car. You go look in that junkyard, and you're going to find that car. Listen to what I'm telling you. I know what I'm talking about. OK. [church bells] Pepper, I'm glad to see you. Hi, Father. So long I didn't see you. How is Maria and the children? OK. Did your wife have the baby yet? Uh, no. Not yet. Not yet. You looked troubled. Ah, somebody-- Some trouble? Yeah, somebody stole my taxi cab. Oh, that's too bad. They did? Yeah. Did you say a prayer? Yeah, I lit a candle to Saint Christopher. Saint Christopher? Yeah. Well, Saint Christopher isn't even a saint. He's not a saint? Well, they took him off the list. You should pray to Saint Anthony. Saint Anthony will help you. Because he is well know. Saint Anthony is a great saint with the lost and found. The working miracles. What's uh-- what's wrong with Saint Christopher? We don't even know if he existed. It's a legend. We don't have any proof. We don't have a rally, we have no writing, nothing about him. Everybody knows Saint Anthony. There's the saint you should go to help to find your taxi. I'll see you later, Father. OK? Thanks. You pray to Saint Anthony. I'll pray for you. I looked in every junkyard in this town. Do you know how many junkyards there are in this town? There must be uh-- I don't know. A couple of hundred damn junkyards. Pepper. Hey. If there's anything I can do to help you, man, you can count on me. Well thanks, fellas. I'll see you later, OK? OK. See you later, Pepper. CARNIVAL BARKER: Hey you. Yeah, you. Sidewinder. You look a lot like Bob Masterson. Come on over and I'll give you three chances to out-draw me. I don't think you could hit a bun with a brick. My gunning arm sure looks sore today. Maybe you got a real good chance to beat me. If I win the shoot out, you've got to promise not to cry. You. You are a Checker cab. And you are a out of shape Yellow cab. Boom. Oh, sorry buddy. But business is business. [vroom vroom] I'll be back someday. Wait for me. [car honking] Yeah? I just want my taxi. I don't want any-- I don't want to cause no trouble. I just want my taxi. I won't say nothing. OK? Just give it to me. -Your straight? What? What do you want? I just want my taxi, that's all. I don't know what you're talking about. I know you're not the wrong guy. -No, no, man. -I know you took it. I saw our face. I know. Now you give me my taxi. You're crazy, man. You're in the wrong house. Get out of here. I just want my taxi. I want my taxi. Ow, what are you doing? You maniac! I'm going to call the cops. Get out of here! What are you talking about? [screaming] [crash] Help! Help! Help! I wanted to tell you about it, you know. But I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the taxi, honey. I didn't want to worry you, you know. It's OK, Pepper. A little bit of wine? OK. You know, I don't know what I'm going to do. I really don't, you know. I tell you, I'm not going back to the factory. There's just no way they're getting me back there. I promise you that. Pepper, the important thing-- that you and me, we are together. [inaudible] PEPPER: What are you talking about? He stole it. He-- And how can you tell me to help you arrest the man if you know that he doesn't have the taxi in his possession? He's got it. I don't know where he's got it, but he's got it. Don't you understand that you can't go around accusing somebody of a crime unless you have proof? He could have you arrested. I got proof. I know who he is. Listen to your brother-in-law, please. I'm an attorney. I want to help. Would you listen to me? Number one, you can't falsely accuse someone of a crime they didn't commit. Otherwise, half the population would be in jail. You understand? You understand? No-- I-- Look-- number two, you entered his-- you entered his place without his invitation. Number three, you went in there and had a fight. Assault and battery. Luckily for you, they beat you up, right? Or you would be in jail today, right? Now please listen to me, Pepper. Please. I want you to-- to go back to the factory. For once, please take my advice. Please take my advice. For Marie and the children, go back to the factory Monday. And pray to god they'll take you back. Will you do that for me, please? Because you have no recourse. I have some tickets here to the baseball game. I want you to take these tickets home tonight, and I want you to tell the boys they're from their Uncle Jaimie. Go to the ball game tomorrow. Enjoy yourself. Relax. And go back to the factory on Monday. Please. Well, thanks for the tickets and all this. You know, that's real nice. Uh-- Let me ask you something. You know-- I mean, you're a-- you're a lawyer, you know. A big man and you know-- you know a lot of things. Do you really think that, uh-- you really think that I should be in that factory, don't you? You know, I don't-- I don't think you belong in the factory. But-- but what else can you do? Well, thanks for the tickets. [crowd cheering] What happened? [cheering] I'll be back. [machinery noises] JAIMIE [VOICEOVER]: Why don't you go back to the factory like I told you to? That's where you belong, the factory. PEPPER [VOICEOVER]: I tell you, I'm not going back to the factory. MARIA [VOICEOVER]: Pepper. Important thing-- that you and me, we are together. My baby. Everything will be all right. Uncle Jaimie will help Papa to find a taxi. I can see him with a big smile on his face saying, Maria, Maria, I found the taxi. And he will give me a big kiss. And one to you. And then we will have a beautiful house. And your brothers, and your sister, and you will go to a big school. Big one. Oh Virgen de Guadalupe, help him to find the taxi. Because it means so much to him and to us. [music playing] Dad, I found your taxi. Dad? Where are you? I found your taxi. We gotta go. Come on. -Where? -No time. Come on. [music playing] PASSENGER: Whoa. Whoa. Be careful. My bananas [inaudible]. I think you have to make a turn up there. Come on. This-- listen to that. Come on, is this as fast as it goes-- this car? You like Cracker Jacks? Up and down hills? Airports are not in up and down hill places. Airports are flat places. Faster. [inaudible] I can't stay around here. You want a Twinkie? You take [inaudible]? Come on, you're going to love it. Here, take a piece. Just a small piece. JAIMIE [VOICEOVER]: When the boys found the taxi for Pepper, Pepper reacted like he had had an injection of hot blood. He kept after me until I loans him the money to have the cab properly licensed, uh, legally. And I also loaned Pepper the money for the meter, guaranteed the insurance, and I made sure he only had to pay me back the money I loaned him-- but at the prevailing rate of retail interest, of course. Pepper went to work like he never had before. And success seemed to come rushing at him. He became my biggest client, and I have some very important clients. I always knew Pepper had it in him, but I have to wonder what would have happened to Pepper if it hadn't been for my continuous encouragement and free legal advice. [music playing]
