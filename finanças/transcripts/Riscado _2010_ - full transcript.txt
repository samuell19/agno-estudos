The medicine is not working yet. I?m going to sound a bit hoarse. I?m sorry, OK? I want to make an honest film. A film that has no lies at all. Because I have a very simple thing to say. And I would like my film to be a little useful to everyone. To help us bury all the dead things we carry. But I?m the first one not to have the courage to bury anything. I want to make a delicate film with a delicacy that you don't have to open your eyes wide to see it. I want to make a film that talks about me. Because that's what I know best. And talking about me... I hope it can talk about everyone else. Great! Very good. Wonderful. Can you improvise something for me now? Can you improvise something for me now? I?m sorry. What? improvise something. Anything. About... Anything? Whatever you like. Something related to your own life. is that OK? Let's... Can I get something in my bag? Sure. To use... What's that? Why this scene? Because I do that for a living. I work at an events company. I do Carmen Miranda, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, several other characters. Hello, hello, Hello. How's everyone? Pedro, Pedro, Pedro. Good Morning. Let's do it? Let's! Good Morning! Hello Rodrigo. How are you? Everybody happy? Hi sweetie! Are you sleepy Julia? Very! Pedro, I need to tell you something? I told her to lay down. Go to sleep Julia... Is that ready? -Do you want to test it? Good Morning. Have you fixed it? I had a very weird dream. What? -I had the weirdest dream. I had the same dream I had when I was a child. Crazy, right? What was it? I was at a circus and there was an elephant at the ring. I walked in to the ring to see it closely. He stepped on me and crushed me fiat. I ended up like a cartoon, turned bi dimensional. I walked like this. Make this work. Call the guy. You've got to pressure him. -I?ve already done that. I want to see things here. You understand? Dam it! I brought 3 pans. We'll begin in a minute ok? Just a moment. We have to work, man. He has to bring stuff down. He has to bring the set things. we don't have much time. For God's sake man. Call him! Pressure him! And I can't come down. I keep on locking to the ground. I can't come down but it's not comfortable up there. But I can't come down. I look to the ground and the feeling I have is that if I could go down I would wish to vanish under it. That's weird. My goodness! Do you have recurring dreams? Yeah... Sometimes I dream I?m in a forest land under a tree. I want to climb up the tree to see the view from up there. But the trunk is to sleek and the first branch is too high. I can't reach it, but I have the feeling that if I get to it I could climb the tree up very easily. As if I was going up the stairs. But I never did. I always wake up before it. I had a crazy idea. Let Stela do it on your place. Just to try something here. Ok Rodrigo? Let's change it just quickly. Go, go, go. But I refer to her as a woman right? Yes, yes... Ok! Yes?! Hi! -Hello darling. Cecilia! I told you about her remember? Yes, I do. -How are you? Fine and you? -Fine. Filipe, the door man asked me to tell you they are going to shut down the water for two or three days. Again? Fuck! in this heat! Be my guests. would you like coffee or water? Some water. -Me too. Get us some water Bianca. For God's sake. Can I get it? -Yes. You should! Sit here Leticia. Cecilia. Sorry. Cecilia. Ok. But come closer to me. Bianca must have told you right? To work here with me, you must know 4 important things, OK? Availability. Commitment. Sympathy and Endurance. Some people will be rude to you. Won't take the flyer... You have to always insist. insisting is key. You will work on your feet for a long time. Hours. But with a big smile on your face at all times. You must have already talked to Carlinhos, about the money thing, right? Carlinhos wasn't in his office, so we called him and he said you could see to it. Really? -Yes. But anyway talk to him afterwards. You are Bianca's friend? -She works with me at the company. Show people too? Yes. -Actress too? Yes. Ok. Great. So do it for me. What? isn't she an actress? Yes she is. Don't you work with Bianca? -She does. Isn't she a theater actress? -I am but... Give me the water baby, and do it for me. Pretend I am a client. Do I really have to do it? -Yes. That sucks. Do you think it's just like that? Life sucks baby. Come on. I just make something up? Life sucks... She doesn't need that. -Yes she does. Let's go? Hi, Good evening. -Good evening. This is the Big Blond Blast. It's a wonderful party for people who enjoy funk beats. What? It's a great party. Lots of beautiful people... Hey guys... No... Big Blond Blast! I love funk!

Lots of beautiful people... -You are beautiful. Lots of fun. -Prettier than you? Free drinks... Some people are like that, isn't that sc? Some guys are jerks. You have to understand that 99% of man are assholes. Understand? -I know. They've even grabbed Bianca's ass once. No way. I never worked in a mini skirt or things like that. Yes, I was joking. The guy tried but I went back and kicked his ass. What? Real good gossip. Really good. Let's go! we can go now. It's an amazing costume party. Five floors. Several DJs. Are you Alice? -No. Bianca. But you look like Alice. -Ah! The costume? A semi dead Alice... Good Evening! Maki Guti in Rio Party. With this flyer it's R$35,00 and there's Japanese food all night long. Take three. Thank you! Not there. On the table. They just did what you said. I told them. The buffet is for free. And they were like: what's for free? Oh my! Why is Filipe always bugging me? You are almost a zombie at work! Felipe is a nice guy. -He is not. Marcia is flirting with him. -I?m not! She is his favorite one. Stop it! -Flirting with the boss... I think he's nice. -Yeah, you bet. You've got the best fantasy, why are you complaining? The best one is Bianca's. It's a killer! How are you going home tonight? -Tonight? I don't know. It's going to be a late night. We didn't talk to him about this. Let's take a van. -Let's go together because I?m scared. The van is OK. It's very quick. Ok, we go together. I?m full. Was it good? Did you bring it? -Home-made. Did you bring it? -Home-made. I had nothing at home. What? -I had nothing to bring. Little by little one fills the pot. -That's true.

I want you to go to the kitchen and get the cake. Bring it with the candies ill. Sing Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday, right? Yes. Read the note and go away. Alright! Would you like me to read the note with an accent as if I was American or not? You do it the way you like. -Alright. I don't want... Don't get too close to daddy. Sitting on his lap, kissing him... touching him... My mother is an old lady, she might get embarrassed. You don't take off your clothes, do you? I?m not a hooker. I?m an actress. You don't need to worry. No... I didn't mean that... I understood what you meant. You should have chosen something else because Marilyn... I do Carmen Miranda, Bettie Page, several others. I?m very professional by the way. Alright then. Could you pay me now? Oh yes. Here it is. Cash it on Monday only as we agreed, OK? May I start? Give me five minutes.

I wanted you to know that because of her, and of you I saw you in your mom's belly I make you this price, that is almost... it's less than half of what that apartment is worth. That area is very valued. And I?m always in debt with people. And what's my excuse? My tenant, she likes to... She has a work that is not an occupation. She likes to do her stuff. When you are a certain age you may dream. You must dream. it is important. Then wake up. I wanted to ask you this. Because it makes me sad. I didn't want to talk to your mother. is she coming to town? No she is working a lot. You see? She works a lot and you are here doing your thing. I work a lot too. But then what? Talk to the people there. Maybe they are under paying you. Do you think you get what you deserve? Efigenia, you are totally right. I?m wrong. I know you are paying. There's no right or wrong.

Really? Nice. Would you like some coffee? Yes... Sit down. Look... -Sugar or sweetener? I?m on a diet. It seems a lot. But mostly they are just small references. What is important is marked. You are going to see a bunch of characters that Thomas thinks are related to the work but he is using a lot of the things you told him. Your life stories of working with pamphlets on bars and on the streets and Marilyn, your impersonation of Carmen Miranda. He wants to include all that in the story, so he is going to put your things on the script. Really? -A good deal of it. How nice! The character, in spite of all these references, is practically yourself right now. It's like as if he wanted to, I don't know... Drag you inside the camera. As if he wanted to make a study about you, about your world. An advice for you: Enjoy it a lot. Of course. I?m very excited. I can hardly believe it to tell you the truth. He was very inspired by the things you told him. That's crazy... Are you anxious? I am! I want to start as soon as possible. It's going to be good to watch those films. Take it easy, that's just how it is. You just have to dedicate yourself. Completely... Think about it. It's a chance of a lifetime. -Absolutely. Would you like some cookies? No thanks. Don't you like those? -No, I?m having a tooth problem. is this your house? I stay here every time I?m in Rio and I work here as well. But my permanent residence is in Paris. 18eme. But I come and go all the time. I don't know Paris. it must be amazing. Yes. Fantastic. But here, this house is delightful. It's also great to work. There's an editing room here. An editing room? So you do everything here? Yes I stay here all the time. Great. Perfect. Perfect. I?m very excited about your audition I?ve watched it a million times. Loved it. Everything you told me. The character will be amazing I want your opinion on everything. I know that's not an ordinary process, but I want you to be with us from the beginning. Mauricio told me you wanted to know more about my life. I?ve already e-mailed him some things. Maybe he has already shown you. I make some videos with my camera. I make them for me on ambition... but I brought them for you. I don't know, maybe they are useful... This is for me? -Yes. Great. May I open it? -Sure, please. It's like a gift... I just made it look pretty. Nice. - it's just a DVD. They are from different phases, since the first ones. Everything I have I put there. I don't know if it's going to be useful anyhow, but at least... These are the things I do... I don't know if it interests you, but if you want to... I?ll watch it... You tell me later... Here is cur script. -Great! What we have so far. I?m going to change it a million times until we start shooting and even after. I?m always working on it. -Can I keep it? Yes. It's just for you to understand what I want to talk about. OK? -Sure. I?ll read it all and fast. You are going to love Sara. I can't wait to meet her. You are going to love her. She is an amazing woman. I think I?ve seen all that she is in, that is available in Brazil. I think she is amazing. She is unbelievable. A monument. But she is coming beforehand, so we can meet, right? Sure, sure. You are going to rehearsal it's going to be very smooth. We are going to work a lot. There will be no problem. Thomas? Sorry. It's from France. Antoine. Oh, Antoine! So, see you soon. -I loved the coffee. Delicious. You did? I chose the beans myself. it's a blend. -Really? Antoine? How are you? Just a moment. Give a bit of the coffee to Bianca. -The last one? Do you like working with him? -I do... You said I do, like... Darling, who likes to work? I like working. -Don't you? I don't like working. Do you really like working? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Depends on the work. If it's something I like doing. I wasn't born to work Blanca. It's enough. No I?m going to fill this to the top. There's a lot of coffee here. Then you will be very alert for the shootings. No, I? going to drink this reading the script. He never gave me even a lump of sugar. It's a joke. I?m kidding. For God's sake. -Thank God. There you go. -Great! I?m going to let you work, I?m disturbing you. No, not at all. What's that? Saint George? Yes, he is killing the dragon. What a handsome Saint George. He has a little moustache. He has blue eyes, hasn't he? Don't all saints have blue eyes? It's great! what does it say? This monster won't stop me! It's a superhero Saint. -A pop Saint George. PATH I?m going to tell the coachman not to deliver any horses. It's easier for a camel to pass through a needle hole, than a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. That's how it is Miss Julia. And now I?m leaving. Alone. Good bye. Devil woman. All because of a bird. Forget the bird. Do you see any way out? Any solutions? No. What would you do if you were me? This? I think so. But pay attention: I wouldn't. But I want to. I just can't. I need you to want it. if you tell me to, I?ll do it. I don't know. I can't. I couldn't give you any orders. It's the damned servant inside me. If Mr. Count came in right now and told me to cut my head off I would do it. So you pretend you're him and I?m you. So, you have never seen an hypnotist at the theater? He tells the person to get the broom, the person gets it. He says sweep and the person sweeps. I?m already sleeping. Here's a broom. Thank you. Now I?m going to take a break. Congratulations! Are you happy? After all that work. it was great! Very beautiful. You were beautiful. Congratulations. I?m very moved. I?m so happy you came! I loved it! I started liking theater again just because of it. Stop it Mauricio. Bullshit. This is Joana. This is Bianca. Nice to meet you. Congratulations! Beautiful. Joana is helping us with the script.

Let's make a toast! Cheers! Success! Success! Look in the eyes... Thank you guys! Thank you! You can't make a toast without looking in the eyes, otherwise... Seven years of sexual bad luck. Who said that? She made that up and we are spreading around. Slow down... I?m dragging myself. I can see it. Did you drink too much? No... no. We worked our asses off. This show was too much work. But I think it was worth it. Did you like it? I think it was amazing. It's been a while since I?ve seen a premiere like this. That's great. I saw your face, I got happy. People were turned on! Everyone was like that! They didn't move. it was... That's good to know. It was great. You were beautiful. You nailed it! You were... It's you. No you! -You directed me. No it was you! Congratulations! Genius! We could have a good audience from now on. Do you think there will be? Ah! War! Some money could come in, right? Yes it could! it would be very good. Have my own place, you know? I don't know... We work a lot. it's heavy duty. I wish I had a car... Had something. I?m already doing what I like. It's not much to ask, right? Oh my God! I don't even know how to drive. I wish I had money to take a cab. I wish I could just call one at any time. Follow that car! -Take me home! Let's get this one. -It's taken. Let's walk, we are almost there. Tell me about the film. How is it going? It's going great. Are they nice? Yes. He is very considerate. intelligent, and willing to... what I?ve read so far is very beautiful. They like you, don't they? Ah Oscar, I think they do. This project sounds very good. It is beautiful. That's amazing, huh? And there's still Sara. Think about it. Very good! -I?m crazy about this. I want to meet her. I?ll go nuts when I meet that woman. Sure! You are going to learn... Let's drink some more. Let's have a beer. The last one... So tell me Thomas? How does it feel to shoot again after 2 years? It's been great. Shooting in Brazil has been an unbelievable experience. Tell me about your expectations. What are the expectations for the Brazilian public? It's huge. it's a cc production between France and Brazil. It's been amazing! The exchange between both crews is wonderful. They are great! Darling! How are you? I?m glad you came! Come here. Look guys, this is my discovery. Look at that! -This girl is amazing. Bianca. She is the only Brazilian actress in the film. What a huge responsibility! Yes. Bianca Ventura. How are you doing Bianca? I?m Fabricio. Hello, hello. Let's put a microphone on her. Please. Do you want me to talk? -Sure! Really? -Of course. -Ok then. Yes it's my first work in cinema. I?m very excited, indeed. Tell me, how does it feel, right on the first work, getting a lead along with Sara Mailman? It is amazing! But we've been working a lot. Working on the script. A lot of research. We've seen some locations so, that's helping me a lot. That's great. So you've already started a while ago? Yes, we are already working. Thomas, when do you start shooting? I?m going to France, to see some locations and do the pre production. As soon as I come back, we start shooting. Wonderful. You are going to start in Brazil? Yes. -Very good. I think that's it. Thank you very much Thomas. I thank you. Nice to meet you. -Good luck! Thanks -Thanks everyone. Let's go check cut the location? -Yes, yes. Sorry. Is Ventura with two Ts? -No, just one. Ok, thanks. Good bye! Let's ask them to take cut the microphones so we can go. It's pretty near. -We have to run. You were great! - was it good? Great! Do you have a light? Hey girls! Light! Do you have a light? Hello! Hi Filipe. Hi darling. Aren't you dressed yet? Go change, the girls are all ready. I tried to call you. i can't do it anymore. I?m doing another work and I?m very busy. And you tell me now? I tried to call you, even left a message. Of course you didn't call me. -Yes I did. My life is basically answering the phone. But you didn't answer me. -Ok. Alright. Where is the costume? -Here?s. Do you have a light? I?ve washed it Filipe. It's clean. And what's this Bianca? -It was already like this. I don't know about that. That's part of the costume. OK. Shoes? -No, the shoes were mine. I?ll have to check that with Carlinhos. Be my guest. Oh! Fuck it Blanca. Does anyone have a pretty friend to replace Bianca? No need to be an actress. if she is a little cute, will do. Filipe! Anyone? -Julia. Does she live nearby? Fuck! Inner city! Another one. Filipe. I have a friend that lives in Copacabana. Just a moment. Get me her number. Yes? -Could you pay me then? That is not what we agreed. Of course it is. You don't pay me for today. -Ask the girls. But for the rest. -That's the money. That's not what I?ve agreed. Who did you talk to? -To Carlinhos. So ask him for the money. I have nothing to do with it. I?m the one who pays, you have to talk to me. Filipe, my life is all organized, understand? I have my bills to pay. -Me too honey. Girls, the number. -2527-4927. She is not fat, is she? She has to fit Bianca's clothes. Bye guys. -Bye. Hello? Hi! How are you? I?m great! And you? Really? Tell me, what is it? As an extra? I?m not doing that. No. I?m rehearsing a movie! Yes! What? No, I have a role. Yes. I swear! It's been great! But look after that, you keep on calling me for work. Call me for other gigs, OK? Alright honey. Good luck. Kisses. Bye. This one! It's the Sara scene. Yes... -We haven't read this one yet. You've changed it. Yes we did. I have completely forgotten. Look what I found in Paris. No! -Yes! Amazing! How do you say that? What? The Man of the Brazil Wood. Did I say it right? -Pretty right. Bois means wood? Yes, wood. Timber. Timber. I?ll leave it here ok? Sequence 32. interior. Bathroom in a restaurant. Night. Veronica is finishing her make up when a woman, who hired the performance, comes in. Hi darling, it's like I told you. You go to the kitchen, get the cake and come to the table with the candies ill. Ask them to turn down the main lights first. Bring the cake, and sing Happy Birthday. I?m sorry. The woman tries a possible American accent. The Happy Birthday, right? Read the note and leave, OK? Would you like me to have an accent as if I was American? Great! Do as you like it. I don't mind. But look, don't grab daddy, OK? No hugging, sitting on his lap, kissing. It's going to be hell if mommy gets upset with the surprise. They don't even go to the theater... Mauricio, less interpretation. Because of this "interaction" thing. You don't take your clothes off, do you? I?m not... Sorry. No, that's correct. Veronica jumps in quickly. I?m no hooker, I?m an actress. You may relax I won't even touch your father. OK. Until there. It was great, very good. I just don't know. Hooker. I think is a little too much. No? Yes, I agree. I feel it's a bit heavy. What if we change the word? Take off the word hooker and put... what? Stripper? I?m no stripper. OK guys, let's think. I can just say... You may relax, I won't get even touch your father. After that line I would get up. When he says he is on top of the column. You are sitting here, then you start to get up, slowly. It's ok. It?s ok... We?ll hold it for you. Find a comfortable way. You?ll get used to it. Seems Feels like failing but you won't. Shake it but don't break it. Find your own way. Let Rodrigo help you. Go on... Come on. Do you already know it by heart? Sure... You are very weird. Maybe, but you are too. Everybody is. It's all like a sinking mud going down, underneath the ground... It's funny... I have a recurring dream. I?m sitting on top of a column and I keep looking down I crave to go down, but I can't. Sometimes I want to climb a tree to view the whole landscape and to catch the golden eggs' nest. I struggle to go up I try to climb, but... Keep on going. Do it again for you to grab it. Do you have a recurring dream? Talk to them. I?ve... -Talk to the film people. She'll make it. She won't be like you. She won't. It's your group, your people. Something you did. You invented. Talk to them they will understand. Do you want me to talk to them? No, that's not the point Oscar. This tour invitation came after the film. I had already committed myself to them. We are already working. But we?ll make money. -I can't leave town. But we've made nothing here. We?ll get some money. I know... We could plan a trip for us afterwards. Do something nice... See places. Have fun. You do it so well. She won't be as good as you. Ok. It's all right. The movie will be great for you. Let it be. I?m sorry... She became a character. What does that mean? That she is better or more interesting than others? She has merits. She could not. We know that happens. But it's not her qualities. it's not her looks. She was signed by the media and became a character. Now she is visible, she achieved visibility. Now she is a character, she is interesting. Everybody talks about her. She is. She exists. She is on screen, so she is somebody. She could be a nobody but now she is somebody. Oscar, go lay on my bed. Or you will wake up all crooked. Alright... Come on... what a crazy cab driver. For Christ's sake. why such a rush? They are always like that. It's wonderful here. -Do you like it Thomas? Love it! You know crazy places, don't you? I used to rehearse here. Underneath the pock there's a kind of a ballroom. No way! We've rehearsed a play here for six months. Really? A ballroom under it! It's such an Armageddon sight. How did they build a pace like that? Suspended over the hill. I got to see it filled with water. Did you swim in it? -No, it was just for the residents. What is that? I have no idea. What are those mountains? -That's the God's Finger. Yes, you can see the mountains, there's the sea. Wonderful, amazing! I?m glad you like it. Hand me the camera. Let's shoot the banana dream sequence here? Yes. The Carmen scene? You are doing Carmen scene here? Yes I will. -Great! Just a moment. My God! You are beautiful! Almost too beautiful. What? -Nothing. The wind is blowing my skirt up. -A real Marilyn. isn't it pretty? Yes. Those strawberries are great! Yes, they are great. So, I need you to make me a reference video of Bianca's Carmen Miranda. For the art department, for the whole crew. An old Carmen film? To edit it? No. With her. With Bianca. Get Bianca, call some musicians. Some metals. Trumpet, trombone... -But Thomas... A tuba... we got to have a tuba. These gigs don't happen every day. They are hired. Get the camera, call Bianca... For when? -She must know some musicians. For sure she does. So, call the musicians, the metals shoot this scene and send it to me. But Thomas we have to pay the musicians. An actor will receive later but musicians have to be paid right away. When they play at a drugstore opening, for example, they get paid right there. So they play. They don't work for free. I know, but I can't use the budget yet. If you ask Bianca, she will pay it herself. For her it will make a difference. If you pay it, you can get it back later. When the money is available. -OK, ck. Do you really need this? -Of course. We need it. The film needs it, not me. Make a video... I?ll pay for it, but keep all the receipts, right? Get receipts for everything. Get all the receipts. Now, for the last time. I need you to solve my Paris flight thing. I called them three times... Didn't you hear me talking to Claire? I don't know. what I know is that... I called her today. -I?m not flying coach. I?ve been calling. -That's the game they play. They are reluctant. It's a political game, they say they won't. She said the same thing now... Tell them I?m only flying first class. Do I tell them that if it's not first class you are not going? Sure, sure. If she tells me it's not possible, I say that it's impossible for you to go? You are not going? I?m only going there to work. If I have to get there destroyed, exhausted... Then there's no use to go. I?m going to work, to deal with a lot of stuff... Thomas is only flying first class. Exactly. Mauricio? Come in! Come see it! -Excuse me. It's wonderful! -Really? Do you like it? My God! That's so much fun! You look great! Do you like this skirt? Those pineapples... it's a lot of different cheap fabrics... They make a nice effect. I have this other top too. That one is great. Maybe it's better for the camera. The golden ruffles are great. The turban is also golden. Is it OK for us to be here? Won't they mind? I?ve worked here a million times. They know me. He?ll give me the key so we can leave our stuff here. You can leave your bag here, if you like We?ll take the key. -I will. Everything is failing apart here. Look. I?ll put those flowers on my head. Bianca, thank you so much. Like this. it will be like a crown. It's great. Thank you. if you didn't help me with that I don't know what I would have done. You don't have to thank me. Doing this is what I want. It's better than if we had it custom made. So, I?ll start the makeup. And the musicians... -I wonder if they are already there? I?ll give them a cal;. And the tuba? Did he say: I want a tuba? He did! Exactly like this. I think it makes sense. -Hello? H;! Mr. Jurandyr. It's Mauricio. No we are on our way. And the tuba? Oh! Thank God! No... thank God! We are on our way. Bye! So there's a tuba? -Thank God! I hope he is good. I?m giving them the song at the last minute. Don't you know him? -Not this one. He told me the tuba I know was busy. But everything will be all right. I?m sure. I told them it was a "marchinha" and when we get there I?ll give them the song. Just to look at you I know it will be all right! Oh my God! There are a bunch of necklaces. I?ll finish the make up and then we can go. Wait! Wait! Come on! Come on! There's no rush, they can wait. Come on! Are you all right? Watch out! You are going to get hurt. Blanca, wait! Run! -I?m not used to it! Come on! Everybody is looking at us! Come, come, come! Watch the red light for God's sake. No! Send them kisses! You are very discreet. You are going to have your nails done! No, I woke up and came to work in the office. Wearing something trivial. I want to do like this in the middle of the street. We?ve to the bus! I think it's right there, we told them to be. What are you telling me? It can't be. But it's not possible. It's not possible. What are you telling me? Pay attention Antoine! No! You are listening to me now. You are going to listen to me now. You are going to throw all we've worked on for years in the garbage? But it's her story Antoine! It's her story, don't you understand? ;... I don't understand. It's not possible. It's impossible! What you asking me is impossible. It is exactly the opposite of all we've worked for all these years. OK... it's just a few days of fun it's a long year, with no plans ifCarnivai should last ionger I don't know what I could do if Carnival lasted a month I?d live on the streets for good! Hello? Hi Thomas! We're shooting it right now! It's beautiful! What? But... what about subtitles? Weren't we going to use subtitles? So, we get someone to dub her. We are in the middle of the thing. But then, she can learn French. Put her in a private class. She can learn it. What now? Why don't you come here right now and tell her that. Tell that to her face! Cut! People! it's great, it's wonderful but the extras with the bananas at the right beat. I need you to lift the bananas at the right beat. More enthusiasm, more joy. More happiness. Let's go? Let's do one more. Lily! Very good. it was very good. Let's go. Playback. Sound. Camera. Action! Captioned: Chalma
