Kneel. What are you doing? What are you doing? Answer me. Answer me. Answer me! In the sixth year of Yonghui, there was an old storyteller shown up in a teahouse in the capital by surprise. He also claimed to be the Tongtian Hierarch. He was full of evil and heretical ideas will all kinds of preposterous things. Soon after, the matter reached the imperial court. Emperor Gaozong was furious. To dispel superstition, the Emperor summoned the old man. The old man chanted an incantation and uttered surprising words. He said Wu Meiniang was going to rebel and proclaim herself Queen Regnant. If the Emperor didn't believe it, search Wu Meiniang's palace. Somewhere in there, there would be a charm cursing Emperor Gaozong. Upright officials of all ranks and descriptions kept hindering Wu Meiniang's title to the Empress. The Emperor had no choice but to order her palace to be searched. Meanwhile, Tongtian Hierarch mysteriously disappeared from his cell. (Detective Dee - Tongtian Hierarch) Attack! Brother Han! My name is Sun Hongyu, a personal maid of Lady of Bright Deportment Wu. I came to welcome you on Lady of Bright Deportment Wu's command. I am very grateful to Lady of Bright Deportment Wu. I'm thankful to Miss Hongyu for your help. Brother, your wound... It's nothing at all. We were ambushed as soon as we got here. It seems that things are not simple. It's not a good place to stay. We have to leave quickly. Are you Di Renjie? Rumor has it that you're a courageous, intelligent man and bolder than all the rest. Now that I met you, as expected, your brow shown that you are indeed very different from those good-for-nothings in the Court of Judicial Review. I don't have any advantages above all. I just do things more patiently and fairly than others. If you can see the big picture, you will make something of your career. Do you know why you were summoned so urgently? I'm guessing it had something to do with Tongtian Hierarch. At ease, Lord Di. Thank you, Lady of Bright Deportment Wu. After what happened yesterday, Shangguan Suyi, who served Lady of Bright Deportment Wu with me, suddenly disappeared mysteriously. Given the fact that whoever did this had to attack from within and without, so Shangguan Suyi must have had something to do with it. This may be a matter of national security, I will do my utmost to get to the bottom of it. For the public, this matter matters to the stability of the court. For personal, you and I are from the same hometown. There is no need for me to say more about the stakes involved, isn't it? Di Renjie, how long do you need to solve the case? The case is complicated. I need fifteen days to solve it. Ten days. Miss Hongyu? Why are you here? - Can't I be here? - Lord Di. Yuanfang, Miss Hongyu is specially appointed by Lady of Bright Deportment Wu to be here to assist us with our case. Assist? It's more like surveillance. Miss Hongyu, please excuse him. That's how Yuanfang is. He talks straightforwardly. My Lord, what shall we do next? Last time, we were attacked in Yushui County. This time, we will also start from there. My Lord, there are happen to have three fast horses ahead. Good. Meiniang, I grounded you here as a last resort. There were many discussions among the officials in the court. Meiniang, Di Renjie whom you mentioned, can he solve this case for real? Your Majesty, all the civilian and military officers at court are far from just trying to punish me. What they are trying to do is put pressure on you. My Lord, there's an inn up ahead. Let's get some food and rest before we set off once again. Sure. - Are you dining or staying in the inn? - Dining. - All right, this way, please. - Okay. My Lord, I heard there is a Wanhua House here. Wanhua House? There are so many beauties there. Let's check it out later. Are you here for investigation or entertainment? Miss Sun. You don't know my Lord. When solving a case, he loves staring at his investigations where there's a crowd. More people, more gossip. Got it? Here. Here is your meal. Here are your drinks. Hey, waiter, we haven't ordered yet. Where do these dishes come from? This is the specialty of our house. Knowing that travelers are hastening on with their journeys, we prepare them all in advance. - Oh. - Here, enjoy your meal. Freeze. Daring bandit. Who incited you to do this? Dan... Dancing Fairy. What "Dancing Fairy"? We haven't inquired him yet, why did you kill him? Miss Sun. From now on, before doing anything, could you ask for our Lord Di's opinion? You took my goodwill for ill intent. It was obvious that he wasn't from Tongtian Sect. This is a gangster's inn. Killing people for money is what they do. I saved you and you blamed me for that? Never mind. No matter who they are, it's not a good place to stay, let's go. My Lord, have some rations. Miss Hongyu. Why don't you come and join us? Why are you keep sulking? We owe you nothing, do we? You know nothing but eating. My Lord. How did you become aware of something off at that inn? Those are just minor accomplishments. Never mind. This Tongtian Sect is something. They were after us the whole time. I've just received the secret edict and a bunch of people knew it already. - Interesting. Maybe we just happened to meet that robber inn. Hope so. My Lord. We have to crash here for a night. We're taking the ferry tomorrow morning to reach Yushui County. Miss Hongyu and I will be taking turns on guard. You should have a rest early. All right. Miss Hongyu. What's the relationship between you and Shangguan Suyi? Don't look at me that way. I'm just curious. We're as close as sisters. So you have friends too. I never thought you had any friends. Look, if you weren't so cold, maybe we could be friends. Don't cotton up to me. We aren't two of a kind. Besides, I don't want to be friends with you. Neither do I. (Yushui County) This is Yushui County. My Lord. Do you want to inform the local Judge Hall? We are handling the case privately, don't disturb the local Judge Hall. I... Hongyu is right. Let's find a place to stay first. Coming, oh? - Are you an outsider? - So what? Do you know the rules in our Yishui County? Dude, what rules do your Yishui County have? Our rules are simple. Brother, I suggest you run for your life. This lady here can kill you without even blinking an eye. - Get lost. - Fine, just you wait. Guests. - Manager. Prepare a table of food and three suites for us. - Sure thing. Manager. Rumor has it that your Yushui County has picturesque sceneries. Why was the street so empty on my way here just now? My guest, there was an incident here. What incident? About what happened exactly, we folks had no ideas. Nevertheless, a lot of people died. They were all placed in the cemetery back there. My guests, that's why you mustn't go out after dinner. Much appreciate, Manager. My Lord. We are here. Let's go. (The cemetery) My Lord. Are you trying to scare us to death? I've told you already. Whenever you want to go something, you must tell me beforehand. I... The tattoos on these men match the ones that attacked us in the forest the other day. In other words, they are in the same boat. My Lord. Is there any chance this tattoo is a sign of the Tongtian Sect? Maybe. I need to look into it a little further. Lord Di. There's something I don't understand. I'm sleepy. We'll talk tomorrow. Lord Di is indeed a strange man. Our Lord has always been so. Since we're investigating the case together, don't keep anything from me. Miss, if our Lord wants to know something, you'll know it. If he doesn't want to know something, you won't know it for sure. After what happened yesterday, Shangguan Suyi, who served Lady of Bright Deportment Wu with me, suddenly disappeared mysteriously. Dancing Fairy. Hello, Miss. May I ask where this place is? Hello, sir. May I ask where this place is? Hello, ma'am. May I ask where this place is? Kneel. What are you doing? What are you doing? Answer me! Answer me! Answer me! Gosh, sir. We're an honest inn, I'm telling you. An honest inn? You don't look like an honest man to me. Sir, I came to bring your foot-bath water. Here. Sir. You don't look like a local to me. Are you here to collect medicinal herbs too? Hey, waiter. What's the matter? Are medicinal herbs what your town lives on? Although we're near the mountain and by the river, there's no fertile field at all. All we can do are going up the mountain to collect herbs, dispense medicines and exchange them for food in the village. So every one of you here knows a thing or two about medicinal herbs? We have been doing it for generations, so I'm sure we know a little bit more than you do. Come here. Do you know which medicinal herbs can make people hallucinate? There are many kinds of magical herbs. I'm telling you, sir, I heard from my uncle that there is a medicinal herb that can make one changes completely after taking it. Have you ever seen this medicine? Do you know what it's called? It's... it's called... Something like... Ah, right! Nightmare! It's just that I was born dull. Why don't you ask our manager? He knows more than I do. Your manager knows them? Go get him for me quickly. Go. Sir. Look at the time now. It's a little bit late now. It's not proper, is it? Well... I don't think it's late. Yes, yes. You're right. It's not late at all. Go get him. This... I just want to take a look at it. Hurry and go. My God, this man. What's wrong, my Lord? I'm fine. I just had a weird dream. My Lord, I just wandered around the town. Nothing unusual was found. Who is this? It's midnight, why don't you let me sleep? Manager. I want to ask you something. Is there anything we can't talk about tomorrow? This is Lord Di. He specializes in handling important cases for His Majesty. Lord. I've seen many lords. If you have something to say, let's wait for tomorrow. What is this? I've seen a lot of this stuff. You're just trying to save money on booze. My Lord, spare my life! Yuanfang. Come on, manager, please stand up. I just wanted to know about one thing. - Thank you, thank you, my Lord. - Sit down. Sit down. I dare not. If he asks you to sit, just sit. Yes, my Lord. Manager, have you ever heard of a medicine called Nightmare flower? This Nightmare flower is a very rare medicinal herb. But some time ago, there was someone mentioned this Nightmare flower on purpose. Who were the people who asked you about that flower? Judging by their clothes, they were definitely not from around here. Have you ever told them about that thing? They were fierce-looking. For one thing, I was afraid of being troubled. For another, I didn't want to talk to them, so I just said I didn't know. My Lord. Not many people have seen Nightmare flowers around here. Maybe just a couple of elders have seen them. Where are they now? Strange to say, two or three of these elders have died suddenly in the last six months. And the others? It is said that they went up to collect herbs and disappeared. (Qingfeng Fort) - Invincible Tongtian! - Invincible Tongtian! She's a knockout. Grandmother! Grandmother! - Let go of me! - Sir, I beg you! I - Grandmother! - Come here! - I beg you, sir. I beg you. She's just a little girl. - Help! - She's not. Get lost! - Don't Don't! - I beg gentlemen who are passing by. - Don't! - Please help us! - Get lost. Please save my granddaughter. - Help me, I beg you. - No! Please help! - Please save my granddaughter. - Don't! - Grandmother. - Come with me. You'll have plenty to eat and drink. All good things. Is this your seat? Get away! I'm confused. Such an odd in this time of the night. Who do you think you are? I am a passer-by. A passer-by? You didn't hear what I just said, did you? I told you to get away! Heroes, this is just a mistake. Get out of here! - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Piss off! Great, great booze. Granny, it's all right now. Thank you. Thank you for your great kindness. Have a seat. My Lord. Stop running around, will you? What if something happens to you? I was just thinking about something, I was lost in thought and ended up here. Thank you for your help. Granny, why are the people in this town so indifferent? No one was willing to help you. They are from Qingfeng Fort. Qingfeng Fort? It's been over half a year. They disappeared somehow and reappeared today. Miss, how did you know those two guys were the bandits from Qingfeng Fort? They have the same sign. A sign? I have waited for you for a long time. My Lord, you have a prophetic eye. I did not expect that there were so many spies placed in this small Yushui County. Who are you? Who sent you here? Yuanfang, look out! There's something wrong with the color of this blood. What happened? Our conversation was overheard. These days, we have to be careful what we say or do. Yuanfang, hurry and clean up this place. Don't let anyone become aware of it. Yes. Miss Hongyu, would you mind taking this to a nearby physician and seeing what's in it? I've asked a lot of people. No one knows a thing. My Lord. The corpse has been disposed of. Let's go. - Let's go back. - Sure. Oh. - Our saviors are here. - Granny. Granny. Granny. Please bring us something to eat. Sure. Caiwei, bring up the food. Right away. My Lord, say, we went to so many places and asked so many people, but no one knew what it is. It looks like it is indeed rare. Hey. Could I have a look? Granny, you don't need to look at it. You won't know even if you do. Come on, Yuanfang. When I was a child, I used to collect herbs with my father, I heard him talk about this medicine. Oh. I think there's poison in this bottle. It's called Soul-losing Powder. My Lord. My Lord, she knows it for real. It is made from thirteen highly poisonous herbs. Granny. Do you know what happens to people who are exposed to this poison? Even though this Soul-losing Powder is highly poisonous, it's as clear as water. Anyone who takes this poison would die suddenly without warnings. Black blood would bleed from their mouths. My Lord, there was black blood in all those mouths. Granny. Did you know there's another medicinal herb called Nightmare flower? This is a peculiar kind of flower. It can change the way people look. It's super rare. Very few people can see it. Have you ever seen it? Two or three of these elders have died suddenly in the last six months. It is said that they went up to collect herbs and disappeared. Gosh. - Yuanfang. - Yes. Get Hongyu, I need you two in my room right now. Thank you very much, Granny. Now, if you'd excuse us. - Take care. - Thank you, granny. Take care, take care. My Lord. Qingfeng Fort entrenched in the mountains suddenly became quiet half a year ago. Those men in black who attacked us and that assassin, too, all had the same marks on them. You mean the bandits of Qingfeng Fort were recruited by Tongtian Sect? They're working for Tongtian Hierarch? So, so there's a good chance Tongtian Hierarch's hiding out in Qingfeng Fort. Ha ha ha. Yuanfang. You're finally using your head now. My Lord. But there's one thing I can't figure out. Say, Tongtian Hierarch already knew we were here to solve the case. In his terms, killing us is as easy as turning over the palm. Why didn't he do it? In contrast, I think he's more afraid of us knowing about the poison. So what shall we do next? Yuanfang. Go to the county government and have them rally their forces to help our crackdown on Qingfeng Fort. Actually, I'd like to meet this Tongtian Hierarch. My Lord, I'm afraid that rushing in that fort will only wake a sleeping wolf. Wu Meiniang only gave me ten days. If I don't act rashly now, it would cost my life. - Hurry and go, Yuanfang. - Yes, sir. I'll go get ready. (Happy Inn) My Lord. Lord Di is asking us to gather troops. Lord Di wanted to gather troops? Good. He is indeed Di Renjie! He's going to make a move! Let's go. My Lord, Qingfeng Fort is ahead of us. It looks heavily guarded. Yuanfang, make a detour to the back and see how it goes. - On it. - We will wait for you here. Got it. Follow me. There are a lot of bandits in the fort. We are short-handed. We can't make a head-on attack but to outfox it, lest we'll wake a sleeping wolf and mess things up. Here is the plan. I'll sneak in after dark, get the feel of the situation and gather some intelligence. You guys go inform Lord Di. Don't act rashly. We'll make plans when I get back. - Go. - Yes. They are back. Where is Li Yuanfang? Lord Li said that the situation in the enemy's fort was complicated, He would go to the enemy's fort alone to check the situation after dark. He asked us to wait for his good news and don't act rashly. All right. Can he do it alone? Li Yuanfang won't be stumped by a few rabbles. Don't worry. Di Renjie. I advise you to mind your own business. Looks like Tongtian Hierarch's got us all under control. We have to barge in. No. Let's wait for Yuanfang. I trust him. What is that? Are you tricking fools? Who are you? Why are you here? Miss, fear not. I am Li Yuanfang. I came here on Lord Di Renjie's orders to track down Tongtian Sect. Who are you? Why are you in a place like this? I don't know why I am here. Then you must have been taken here by those bandits. Fear not. Could this be the Nightmare flower? Your clothes and hairpins are the things of the palace. You must be the missing Shangguan Suyi. I don't remember who I am. Miss, follow me. Where are you taking me? I'm taking you to Lord Di Renjie. How should we go with all these people out there? Fear not. I know a shortcut. Quick, come with me. Hey. Quick, come with me. Let's go. Hey. Hey. Let's go. My Lord. The girl who was rescued yesterday is resting inside. The way she dresses like a court lady. Miss Hongyu, could you verify if she's the missing Shangguan Suyi? Suyi. Why are you here? Who took you the other night? Are you all right? Who are you? It's Hongyu. Hongyu, do you remember me? Hongyu, don't you remember me? I can't remember exactly. - Yuanfang. - Yes. Get a physician to have Miss Shangguan Suyi checked right now - to see what's wrong with her. - Yes, sir. My Lord. For the next move, we... Call the county government and tell him to gather elite troops for me. I'd like to meet those in Qingfeng Fort. Yes, sir. My Lord, you go first, I'll stay here with Suyi. Miss Hongyu, I need your help. Come with me. I... Come on. Suyi. My Lord. There's nothing here. No one's here. Interesting. Lord Di. This is the best physician here in Yushui County. My Lord. So far, her pulse is normal, nothing strange was found. Nothing strange was found. It means she's in good shape. Miss Shangguan, are you sure you can't remember anything about yourself? I don't remember. Physician, please - check up on her once again. - Yes, sir. My Lord. The meal is ready. Lord Di. You and I can go outside to have a drink while waiting for the result. All right. - Thank you for Lord Xu's politeness. - Please. My Lord. I found this thing in Qingfeng Fort yesterday. Maybe it's Nightmare flower. Please keep it. Lord Xu. This Nightmare flower is truly a magical medicine. I've heard about this Nightmare flower. I've never seen it. But I've heard that the potion from the Nightmare flower can change a person's appearance. It's miracle. Interesting. Come on. I'd like to propose a toast to you two. Thank you, Lord Xu. Who is it? Some of you stay here. The rest goes after them. My Lord. My Lord. - My Lord. - My Lord. - My Lord. - My Lord. My Lord. My Lord, what happened? Lord Di. I failed in my duty to protect you. Even death cannot atone for this. Where is the Nightmare flower? It's not good. Yuanfang, Hongyu! Stop chasing. Lord Xu, what is the matter with that physician? Lord Di, we all know that physician. He couldn't have had any problems. Never mind, Lord Xu. He is not the physician you know. Not the one I... Then he... Tongtian Hierarch went to a lot of trouble to take the Nightmare flower and Shangguan Suyi. My Lord. They took the Nightmare flower. Don't tell me they want to change their appearance again. It's not good. Yuanfang, Hongyu! Hurry and follow me back to the palace. Yes. Lord Xu. At your service. Please keep an eye on Shangguan Suyi. If anything goes wrong again, I'll hold you accountable for it. I'm obeying your command! I, Di Renjie, pay respects to Your Majesty. At ease. Di Renjie, how is the case going? I went to Yishui County and have found out the truth. A gang of bandits entrenched a fort and plotted a rebellion. And I found the missing Shangguan Suyi. It's just... What? Say it. It's just I found out Shangguan Suyi is their leader. They made the elixir in secret intending to murder Your Majesty. What? How dare they. Di Renjie. Here I am. You did great on handling this case, I Will reward you well. Thank you, Your Majesty. Here. I'm granting you a cup of good wine. Di. Make yourself at home. Come on. Your Majesty, I Cannot hold the liquor. Lord Di, you have to drink the wine given by His Majesty. My Lord, you have to drink the wine given by His Majesty. Carry him away. When will Di Renjie come to see me? Your Majesty, Lord Di should be on his way by now. - He'll be... - I, Di Renjie, I beg Your Majesty to atone for my late coming for the rescue. I, Sun Hongyu, pay respect to Your Majesty. At ease. Di Renjie, you're really something. Everything was exactly as you said in your letter. Let me ask you this, do you have any idea who Tongtian Hierarch's working for? Your Majesty, as far as we can tell, Tongtian Hierarch did it all alone. Your Majesty, we found the missing Shangguan Suyi. But she has lost her memory. Your Majesty, Lady of Bright Deportment Wu is framed. Now her name is cleared, please tell the world and exonerate Lady of Bright Deportment Wu, Your Majesty. Certainly. Of course I know Meiniang's mind. I will make her my Empress. Your Majesty, Shangguan Suyi has now been arranged by me to the post-house. But I still can't figure out why she disappeared or how she lost her memory. When I get to the bottom of all this, the case will be closed. Good. I want you to do it fast. Sun Hongyu, go back and serve Meiniang. Make no more mistakes. Yes, Your Majesty. So you've come. Miss Hongyu. As expected, you are very capable, Lord Di. Miss Hongyu. Lord Di had long since suspected you. We are not friends after all. Since when have you suspected me? To be honest, I don't believe that there is any magic in this world. The enemy knew every step of our plan. That's when I started to suspect you. There must be something odd with you. And every time you kill someone to prevent secrets from being disclosed, it just didn't feel right to me. The reason I put off exposing you was to see what you really want to do. What's done is done. I can't escape from death anyway. Why should I bother to tell you the truth? And considering how smart you are, I think you will reveal it pretty soon. Miss Hongyu. It's not worth it. Shangguan Suyi and I are both orphans. We grew up together and entered the palace to serve Lady of Bright Deportment Wu together. She's smart, ambitious and aspiring. Anything she wants, she will have it by all means. She's my best friend and the one and the only family that I have. Whether she's a good person or a bad one, whether what she's doing is right or wrong, it's worth it for her. Di Renjie. Even if you find out the truth, it's still too late. You lost anyway. Don't! Miss Hongyu, Miss Hongyu! Why did you do this? When a person sees through all but fails to save the situation, perhaps that is the greatest pain in the world. Lord Di, we'd better don't be too smart. Miss Hongyu. Miss Hongyu, Miss Hongyu! Sure enough, Miss Hongyu is a genuine person. Although we only spent a few days together, but I feel... She died for what she unshakably believes in. This is sort of her destination. My Lord. What did Hongyu mean by what she just said? If I have not been mistaken, Lady of Bright Deportment Wu inside the palace is a fake one. You mean someone used the Nightmare flower to took Lady of Bright Deportment Wu's form? And Sun Hongyu was her partner? Who could take Lady of Bright Deportment Wu's form? I got it! It's Shangguan! It's Shangguan Suyi! That's right. Then who is this Shangguan Suyi? Where is the real Lady of Bright Deportment Wu? Whoever she is, take her back to the palace first. No time to lose. - We must move at once. - Yes. Here comes His Majesty. Your Majesty, this man... Please set things straight for me, Your Majesty. Di Renjie, what is it all about? Your Majesty, I went to Yushui County under the orders to look into Soul-losing Powder and Nightmare flower. I was told that a group of evil men was also looking for them. Tongtian Hierarch was one step ahead of me here and there. So I assumed there were eyes and ears around me. Until not long ago, when she raided the post-house at night and tried to take Shangguan Suyi away. At this point, I finally knew Shangguan Suyi's secret. It wasn't Shangguan Suyi whom Tongtian Hierarch was trying to hide from me to the point that he could destroy evidence of crime completely, it was Nightmare flower. This flower can change a person's appearance. Tongtian Hierarch used it to deceive people and transform into someone else. And Shangguan Suyi is Lady of Bright Deportment Wu whose face was changed by this flower. Shangguan Suyi is the real Lady of Bright Deportment Wu? Di Renjie, it's a pack of lies! You're talking nonsense! Do you have any proof for saying that about me? Do you remember that cup of water you just had? The Nightmare flower? Your Majesty, Shangguan Suyi has confessed her crime. I put nothing in that water just now. It's literally a cup of water. Di Renjie. You will eventually be condemned by history. Wu Meiniang will rise in rebellion sooner or later. Ha ha ha. Ha! Imperial physician Wang, if something happens to Meiniang, I... I will have you beheaded. Your Majesty, please don't worry too much. Her Highness will definitely be... - Get lost. - Yes. Your Majesty, Her Highness regained consciousness. Quick, help Imperial physician Wang go to rest. Meiniang, you've regained consciousness. How do you feel now? My head hurts. Meiniang, do you remember anything? I remember that night, Shangguan Suyi brought me a cup of water. After drinking it, I got dizzy. I don't remember anything after that. Your Majesty, what's wrong with me? You were set up by Shangguan Suyi and others. You disappeared for days. You had me worried sick. Meiniang. Thanks to Di Renjie, you are saved. Summoning Di Renjie and Li Yanfang go to court. - I, Di Renjie. - I, Li Yuanfang. Greetings, Your Majesty. At ease. Thank you, Your Majesty. Di Renjie, I have heard of him. We are from the same hometown. Oh? How are you now, Lady of Bright Deportment Wu? I'm all right now. It seems that the Imperial physician is more skillful, as expected. Of course. Meiniang, Di Renjie is smart and broad-minded. Thanks to him, you and I can be reunited once more. Where is Shangguan Suyi? She... Shangguan Suyi was in a heresy. She killed herself. Di Renjie, Li Yanfang, how do you want me to reward you for your good work? It is the duty of a subject to share his worries and solve his problems for the Emperor, I dare not take credit. Di Renjie, I think you're a genius of country governing. At the moment, I am at the point of in need of personnel. You should stay in the capital. I Know nothing but to judge cases. I'm not experienced enough to be an official. Di, don't refuse this. - Being an official and solving a case... - Your Majesty. Huh? In that case, I have an idea. Oh? I heard from you that Liangzhou has been suffering from famine for years. We'd better send Di Renjie there to be a magistrate. He can gain experience there. If he manages well, he can go back to the capital to serve you, Your Majesty. You're right. Publicizing my decree. I order Di Renjie and Li Yanfang to take office immediately. Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, Empress Wu's coronation will take place in three days. It's not too late to let Lord Di go to the post after attending the grand ceremony. Hey. Empress Wu. Thank you, Your Majesty. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Well, these days, you were upset a lot by some unkindness. I want to give you a surprise. Congratulations, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Empress Wu. Off you go. If you'd excuse us. At ease. I Didn't ask you to stay at court. What do you think? I Have no thought about that. If You want to stay at court, I can let you stay. I, Di Renjie, am where the people want me to be. Maybe right now is not the time. Di Renjie, you are a very intelligent person. I'm sure we'll meet again soon. If you'd excuse me. My Lord, there's one thing I can't figure out. His Majesty has granted you permission to stay in the capital and assist him. Why didn't you seize that chance? Do you think we can stay just because His Majesty wants us to? I got it. Then why didn't you explain the situation to His Majesty? She's more talented than her current station. But the desire for power is not always evil. Our Tang Dynasty also needs more talented people to run it. As long as it's good for the people and good for the country, I, Di Renjie, have no regrets even if I'm dead. My Lord, are we just leaving like that? Don't worry, it won't be long before they get us back.
