[gentle music] [birds chirping] Hi! I'm Richard Thomas. And I wanna wish you a happy Thanksgiving. Holiday traditions are like old friends that come to visit once a year. They give us a chance to reminisce and count our blessings, and to remember how deeply connected we are to one another. That's the way it's been with me and my family, and that's my wish for you and yours. Thanksgiving in particular is a day for reflection and reassurance, especially during difficult and confusing times. We're not only grateful for all those blessings we've received, but we're also reminded of the precious role that giving plays in all our lives. And that's the way it is with a family called the Waltons. [theme music] [Adult John-boy] During Thanksgiving season in 1934, we had much to be grateful for on Walton's Mountain. While the yield on Daddy's first corn crop was less than he hoped for, it was good enough to squeak by. Farm work was challenging, but we were far better off than most folks. I had been a bit distracted, and at times, my mind would wander about thinking of stories I should be writing. And there were the two girls in my life. As Thanksgiving approached, we were reminded that sharing what we had was just as important as giving thanks for what we received. And I learned what it really meant to take responsibility for my actions. [lively chatter] [Olivia] Mary Ellen, help me in the kitchen. Jim Bob, eat it or lose it. - I'll eat it. - You heard her. - Use a fork, Jim Bob. - What did I tell you? Thanksgiving is right around the corner. Have y'all thought about what you're grateful for? Well, I'm grateful for the Baldwins' odd jobs, that's for sure. Helps tide us over 'til planting begins. [John-Boy] How about you, Jason? I'm grateful for no school over the holidays. [John-Boy] That figures, yeah. Well, I'm grateful for the new pack horse book lady. So is John-Boy, huh? And why are you so grateful for her? Well, you'll see! Jim Bob, what are you grateful for? Well, I'm grateful for the Harvest Festival Fair. Can't wait to see all the crafts. I... give it... am thankful that Sister Harriet and Brother William are helping me and Jason rehearse for the talent show at the fair. Elizabeth? Your turn. - You first. - Okay. Uh, I'm grateful for... Momma's pancakes. [Mary Ellen] Oh, John-Boy, that is a cheat! - We are all thankful for that. - Now you. I'd be more grateful if Momma and Daddy would let me have a pet rabbit. Aww, hey, we have plenty of animals roaming around here, okay? We don't need pets. Your daddy's right. [Erin] What about you, Momma? You haven't said what you're grateful for yet. [sighs] I thank the good Lord every day for this family. [gentle music] Well, nobody can top that one. Okie-doke. Jason, John-Boy, we're off to the Baldwins. - Yep. - Here we go. Okay, let me show you how it works. [grunts softly] And then he picks the penny up when he gets back to the other side. Do you get the idea? Okay, you two carry on. I'll be back before you know it. Okay, my turn! Give me the penny, Jim Bob! I had to give Jason my favorite marble for it 'cause he said it was lucky. How do you know? Has a little ding on Lincoln's nose. [lively music] [doorbell ringing] Well, of all people, it's Olivia Walton. Oh, Mamie, Emily, it's so nice to see you! - I'll be right with you, Olivia. - Oh, no hurry. We thought fresh lemonade for John and your boys would be a special treat during their work break this afternoon. That's so thoughtful, Emily. They're building an addition to the house as we speak. Is that so? [Emily] We think demand for our moonshine recipe could double after the Harvest Festival Fair. Which is why we need the added space. [Emily] Now that it's legal, we have entered the recipe in a contest at the fair! But I-I wasn't aware there's a category for the recipe. We proposed to no one alternative beverages! [Baldwin sisters laugh] And dear Mrs. Abernathy, who's president of the Festival Fair board, approved. You know she's the richest woman in the county. And she was good friends with our father, the judge. [Both] God rest his soul. She asked me to be one of the judges in the pie competition. I'm very excited! [gasping] Oh... Whatever you say, dear. Well, what's wrong? Well, uh... I, for one, wouldn't want to be in your shoes if your mother-in-law was not the blue ribbon winner. After all, that's what she's known for in these parts. I have thought about that. And Grandma would want me to be fair. And she knows that I'm honest. So whatever the outcome, it won't bother her a bit! Mm... Right? I'm not so sure, dear. I shouldn't worry about it too much, Olivia. Whatever happens, sooner or later, whether she wins or loses people will talk. Even the queen of pecan pies isn't 100% safe in this county. Does Grandma even know, hm? Not yet. [gasping] Maybe I should withdraw. [Both] Oh no, don't do that! [Emily] You don't want to upset Mrs. Abernathy. - Oh, no. - She asked you to do this. [Mamie] Yes. Oh, that would be worse than upsetting Grandma. You're... you're... you're right. I have to do it. You're some brave woman, Olivia. Very brave... Ah... [Mamie] Oh dear... [folksy guitar music] [gasps] He can be my pet! You know what Daddy said! No pets! [Elizabeth] Bunny, bunny! - [Jim Bob] Wait up! - [Elizabeth] Come back! Where did he go? [Jim Bob] Probably don't wanna follow it into the woods. [engine sputters] [Jim Bob] Midway Games? [truck door shuts] [folksy guitar music] Hi! Wanna play? Nah, Abner wouldn't like it. Is he your daddy? Nope. I don't have any family. You don't? What about your parents? Don't know 'em. Dumped me in an orphanage as a baby. So that guy adopted you? Kinda nosy, aren't ya? Sorry, I'm just a little... Nosy! It's okay. Couldn't get adopted. Maybe 'cause my red hair. Anyways, 'bout a year ago, orphanage decided to put me in foster care with Abner and his wife. They aren't lookin' for anything permanent, though. They just want free help. Hey, you must be headed to the Harvest Festival Fair. Yeah, uh, I run the duck pond game down in Midway. What's the duck pond game? [Abner] Red! You know you're not to leave the truck. Feelin' cooped up is all. That include talking to strangers. You need to get back in that truck pronto. Hear me? Get! - Ah, ah! - [gasps] Wait! Maybe you can use this to buy a soda when you get to the fair. Thanks. My name's Elizabeth. Thanks Elizabeth. Actually, it's a lucky penny, so maybe you shouldn't spend it. I'm Jim Bob. Okay. Thank you both. I'll keep that in mind. [Abner] Hey! Don't make me tell you again. Maybe I'll see you there. Let's go. [truck door shuts] One is plenty. Aww! If there were a muffin contest, you'd win hands down. That is very sweet, Rose, but the last thing I wanna hear about is another baking competition. Olivia, there is no reason to be anxious about judging the pie contest. I talked to the Baldwin sisters, and now I am genuinely concerned about what Grandma's gonna think if she doesn't win! She has brought home the blue ribbon every year. People all over the county know about her pies. Folks have been trying for years to figure out the secret of her Walton pecan pie recipe. Livy, for goodness sakes, the Baldwin sisters? It's a blind taste test. You've got a vote, I've got a vote, and whoever Mrs. Abernathy names as the third judge has a vote. Put your worries to rest. If Grandma Walton wins, she wins. If she loses, she I will never hear the end of it! Oh, welcome home, troops. Good day at the Baldwins? [John] Oh yeah. [Groans] It's always an adventure. - Hey, Rose. - Hi, John. Hey, boys. John-Boy, go take off your boots! Trackin' mud in my kitchen. You know better than that. - Sorry, Momma. - Ooh, muffins. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, just one before dinner. Yes, ma'am. Oh my, it's later than I thought. I must be on my way. Nice to see you all. Remember what I said, Olivia. Everything will be just fine. - Oh... - Oh, I got dibs on the bathtub. What? No, no, no, no, no, okay? That's not fair, all right? I'm dirtier. - He called dibs. - Thank you. John-Boy, you got a letter! Hey! No, no, no, no. Would that be another sweet note from Pack Horse Librarian Number One? - That's none of your business. - Oh, wait, wait, wait. Does she know that you've been hitting it off with Pack Horse Librarian Number Two? Maggie and Edith are good friends of mine. Ahh, and I'm next in line to be king of England. No, you're next in line for the bathroom. Ah. [lively music] [Maggie] Hi, JB! Thanks for your letter. Sounds as if you're as busy as I am. Been studying day and night trying to keep my grade point average good enough to graduate a year early. Wouldn't that be something? I don't have a ride home for Thanksgiving break, so I intend to stay in my dorm and work on an extra credit project. But I plan to see you at Christmas. I hope you're making time to write your stories. They're very important to me. Send me something. Miss you. Maggie. [gentle piano music] [Adult John-Boy] Maggie and I had a great relationship, and she did everything she could to stay in touch. [Jason] Hey, Pack Horse Libarian Number Two coming up the road! [Adult John-Boy] But in her absence, I'd really hit it off with. Maggie's pack horse replacement, Edith. They were both special, and I found myself caring for both of them. - Hey, Edith! - Hey! What a surprise. I thought Robinson Crusoe was due next week. Oh, it's a special delivery, John-Boy. Romeo and Juliet, just like you ordered. I didn't order Romeo and Juliet. I did! Spotted you comin' up the driveway. What? I'm gonna be Juliet for the talent show at the fair. - [Edith] [laughs] - What do you know? Seems like everyone's competing these days. I mean, we got Grandma with her pie, right? Mary Ellen and Jason gonna perform. Now Erin. I even heard the Baldwin sisters are. Them I'd like to see on stage. No, no, no, they're entering their, uh, special recipe in an alternative beverage contest. Mmm, guess my home brew doesn't stand a chance, then. Probably not. Well, I suppose I should be headin' along. Can I walk you to your horse? Sure. To be honest, I was kinda hoping you were getting interested in love stories. Well, you can recommend me one. Maybe with a happier ending. Ah, well, for you, I'll work on it. - For you, I'll read it. - You going to the fair? What a stupid question, of course you are. Last day, yeah. You? I was thinking about maybe going then. Well, maybe we could meet up. Maybe go on a couple carnival rides. - I mean, that might be fun. - Might be. - Maybe. - [giggles] Maybe I'll see you then. - Maybe so. - Okay.

If you don't like it, find someone else! [Mary Ellen] Do you see what I'm dealing with?! I mean, I-I just want this to be perfect. Mary Ellen, you have a beautiful voice. But music is also about harmony, as well as collaboration with the musicians. Everyone makes mistakes. You have to learn to trust and support one another. What do I do now? If I were you, I'd work on an apology. Good luck with that! [gentle, pensive music] Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny. What I have spoke, but farewell compliment. So... "doost" thou love me? [John-Boy] Dost? Pronounced "dust". Like what a galloping horse kicks up. Dost. Thanks, John-Boy. So, dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Ay". And I will take thy word. O gentle Romeo! If thou dost love... [knock on door] [sighs of relief] - [Elizabeth] We're saved! - [Jim Bob] I got it! - [Elizabeth] No, me first! - [Jim Bob] No, I'll get it! [Elizabeth & Jim Bob] Grandma! Grandpa! - Good morning. - Don't you look pretty? Come here and see me. Where's your momma? She's in here. Uh... Mind if I ask you something, Grandpa? Well, sure! That's what grandpas are for. Come on. [birds chirping] Did you ever hit Daddy when he was a boy, or kick him hard or anything like that? Well, where in the world is this coming from? Just wonderin'. Hm. No, I never did that with any of our boys. And we had a house full of ornery ones runnin' around. Now, my daddy used to give us younguns a whoopin' every now and then. But he never was mean about it. The fact is, no good ever came of it, either. And we both always felt bad about it afterwards. So, I found out I could always get my point across with our children in gentler ways. Okay. Thanks. That's it? Yes, sir. [sighs] Can I share something with you in absolute confidence? - Oh, yes. - Good. I've run out of my pecan pie secret ingredient and I thought you might have some to spare. Oh, uh, uh, if I... If I have it, um... [whispers] What is it? The Baldwin sisters' moonshine recipe. Grandma! I just mix it with a little honey before I put it in the filling. I don't need much. We both know John has a jar around here somewhere. Oh, well... Oh! [laughs giddily] Just pour me an inch. Too much would absolutely ruin the pie. You know, I have something, uh, a secret that I've been... - Just a titch more? - Oh, um, yeah, sure, yes. Oh, Grandpa, Grandpa, hello! [Grandpa] Livy. I was just telling Grandma, oh that I've been asked. No, let me say I have agreed to be one of the three judges in the p-pie contest at the fair. So! Oh, I know you're honest. Don't fret about it. Doesn't bother me a wit! My pies always win because they are the best. - You'll see. - Hah. No pressure intended... Right, Grandma? Well... [laughs] Of course not. You don't care what people might say? I know you will do the right thing, daughter. After all, we are family. Come on, old man. [lively music] [pants] Oh... oh... oh. [owl hoots] - [knocking on door] - [Olivia] John-Boy? What is it, Momma? Are you aware that you left the water running in the sink again? Uh... are you sure? Of course I'm sure. So Jason ratted on me, then. This is not Jason's problem. You need to own your mistakes. Okay, I must... I don't know. I-I must've been distracted. I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on with you. But it is gettin' worse. You need to pay attention to what you are doing. Like what? Like forgetting your schoolbooks? Or leavin' the cow pen open, or forgetting to put the lid back on the paint bucket, chomping mud all through my house, losing your pocketknife! I found it, okay? I was using it as a makeshift bookmark. John-Boy! [gentle music] You are my oldest. I need you to get your head out of the clouds and start taking more responsibility. Am I clear? Yes, ma'am. [door shuts] [sighs] [jazz on radio] Are the kids down or... at least on their way? Well, all but John-Boy. Yeah, writin' no doubt. If he hasn't lost his pencil. I swear, he's become so absentminded these days. He's got the attention span of a gnat. Well, I figure he's concentrating too much on, uh... those stories he's constantly working on. I suspect his mind may be on something else. - [sighs] - Like what? You know very well what. That new pack horse library girl. And you saw, he got a letter today from the first one. Ain't she the one that went off to college, right? Mmm I kinda thought he was sweet on her. He's 17. He's just trying to figure things out. [sighs] He could still be a little torn between the two. He does sit next to Edith every day at school. And she's as pretty as a picture. Hm-hm. Oh, but John, they're so young. Just like a pretty as a picture 17-year-old girl that I once courted. Oh, well thank you very much. I will sleep real good now. Oh, John! What? [giggles] You're terrible. [laughs] Come here, come here. Oh... It's gonna be all right. - You think? - You raised a good boy. We raised a good boy. Yes, we did. [gentle music] [birds chirping] Jason, are you busy? [chickens clucking] [Mary Ellen] Of course you are. Um. I have something that I need to say to you. Want! Want. I have something I want to say to you. Go ahead. Flossy won't mind. [Flossy moos] All right, um... [chickens clucking] I wanted to apologize to you for the other day. I know you were trying really hard, and sometimes things just don't go as planned. And I was wrong to be so critical. I was just so nervous and tense about my singin' and I just want things to be so... perfect. I shouldn't have taken that out on you. Anyways, I just, um I came here to apologize. And tell you that I I don't wanna... collaborate with anybody else. [gentle music] "Collaborate"? Did you write that one out? - So what if I did? - Can I read it over? Jason! Please don't be so difficult. We have a day and a half left before the talent show. Could you please just play the banjo for me? Jason, please! [sighs] [chickens clucking] [birds chirping] Maybe I'll do it. If you... finish my chores for the day, so I can work on my banjo-pickin' perfection, huh? Get to it. [sighs] [Flossy moos] [laughter] [Mary Ellen] What smells so good? Who wants dessert? Me! Just so long as no one says the word "pie" until after the fair. [Jason] Oh, speaking of the fair I heard there's gonna be more fireworks than last year. How do you know that? [unintelligible] has told me so. There's a reliable source. Well, he's on the fireworks crew. They should time it in to my performance as a tribute. [Jason] Oh, brother. I wanna play the duck pond game. We met an orphan boy who runs it. Runs it? All by himself? [Jim Bob] Yes sir. He works for this man who's really mean, but I guess he's stuck with him. How old's this boy? Uh, not much older than Erin, but younger than Mary Ellen. Somethin' doesn't sound right. Maybe this fella's his daddy. - No sir, he told us so. - [Elizabeth] I felt bad for him. I hope I can see him again at the fair. [Olivia] Okay, but with that kind of man out there, stay stuck like glue to John-Boy. I don't want you runnin' off. - Clear? - Okay. Momma, I might be meetin' someone there. [Jason] Oh yeah? Well, whoever she is, that just means that you can both take care of Elizabeth, right? Yay! Okay. [lively music] [birds chirping] The entries are due by noon. That bus will be here directly. And Mother? You know how concerned Olivia is about all this. Oh, not again! I know it means the world to you. But she is your daughter-in-law. And we are family. - And family sometimes... - Enough. I have heard enough. I have more blue ribbons than anybody in this county, and... and you're a broken record! Oh, just go on and do what you wanna do. You know I will. You're givin' me a headache. Could you go into Art's and get me some aspirin? [birds chirping] Now, while I'm gone, I want you to ask yourself this question... Are you gonna enter that pie for your own glory, or withdraw it for Olivia's sake? [birds chirping] [gentle music] [no audible dialogue] [Grandpa] There! Got you the extra large size. [squish] Ah! That wasn't there before. [Grandma] Get up! Oh... You did that on purpose. [sighs] The Lord works in mysterious ways. [theme music] [lively chatter] [shouting] Ma'am. We'll get some cotton candy later, I promise. [Woman] Welcome to the Harvest Festival Fair. Hey, Red! Hey, Red! Hey. You're, uh... You're Elizabeth, right? Yeah! I'm here with my family. Nice. Where is your duck pond? It's down in Midway. I'll see you there. Hey, Jim Bob? Is that the boy you told us about at supper? Yes, sir. And I worry about him working for that mean man. [carnival music] Well, let's keep an eye on him. Hey, Walnuts! Gather around, gather around, gather around. Come on in. Now remember, today's the last day of the fair, and I want you all to enjoy yourselves. So go your own way for now. But also, I want you back together later for the talent show. It's at four o'clock. Erin and I are gonna register now. Jason, while your mom is judging pies, you and I are meeting Grandpa in the livestock area to take a look at some hogs. Great. John-Boy, Elizabeth... Stuck like glue. Jim Bob, where are you gonna be? I'm meeting Claudie at the craft exhibit. - A lot of neat stuff in there. - Okay. Okay, everybody know the drill? - Sure. - Then get! Get! Have a good time! - I'll be right back. - Sounds good! Livy? Gonna be all right? Yeah. Hey... don't you worry one bit about Momma's pride. Easy for you to say. Oh! [sneaky music] God helps those who help themselves! Why, Mrs. Windham! Is that your cherry chess pie you're entering? Yes, ma'am. - Wish you luck! - Thank you. Well, how about I just put it right here? You know I'm not a baby. You don't need to hold my hand the whole time. Okay, all right. Just promise to stick with me. You know what? If we get separated, meet me back at the information booth, okay? Yeah? Got that? Yes, I promise. But when are we going to the duck pond? Just be patient, all right? - Hey, John-Boy! - Hey. - I thought I missed you. - Me too. We're going to the duck pond. Hi, Elizabeth. Don't you look pretty with your lips so cotton candy pink? - Really? - Oh sure, look, look here. Hey! I feel pretty. What do you say we stroll down to Midway - and go on some rides? - I'd love that, Edith. Let's spend the whole day together. You know about the duck pond game? [lively music] [Olivia] Mrs. Abernathy. Oh, Mrs. Walton! Welcome! Oh, one judge to go and then we can... Oh, there you are. Welcome. Oh, Charlie. Charlie Sneed. Charlie! Howdy do, everybody? Happy Thanksgivin' week. - I almost didn't recognize ya. - Like my new look? Got me a safety razor for my birthday. Went to town on my hair. Well, it's nice to see your face. And to learn that you're a pie judge! Best taste buds in the county. Turn 'em loose! Yes, well, I-I know it's usual for a gentleman to take his hat off when he's inside. But perhaps, Mr. Sneed... you should put yours back on. Mrs. Abernathy! No, really. Good golly! It's made from nothing but matchsticks. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, but that took forever to build. - Wait! Don't toss that. - Why not? I can use it. - For what? - I don't know yet. But if you want me to help build your tree house, you're gonna need to show me where you got this ice pop. [laughs] Okay, come on. We have given each pie an entry number. So, you may begin! Now, your scorecards have three areas, of appearance, taste, and creativity, with the allotted points allowed for each subcategory. As delicious as most of these pies look, I suggest you limit your sample to a bite or two. As tasty as a pie may be, too much will saturate your palate and affect your judging. [Adult John-Boy] Momma had a hard time identifying Grandma's pie. Mm-mm! Delicious. - Are we done? - Yes, ma'am! - Pleasure. - Thank you very much. [inhales] [Adult John-Boy] Which only complicated things. Thank you very much. Okay, that's yours. An honest taste. - Honest taste. - Well done. - Thank you, thank you. - Well done. [Erin] O gentle Romeo! Thou dost love... Dost love... Pronounce it "fithfully." No, faithfully. Pronounce it faithfully! Erin! Will you stop it? I'm just so anxious, it's hard to remember! You've gotta take your mind off of it. Put the book down and shoot a clown instead. - Come on. - How does this work? All right, you hit a tooth just right and it swivels to black. The goal is to get all the teeth to black, and the first one to do it wins. Got it? [Boy] Wait a sec. This seat taken? Let me get set. [bell rings] [adventurous music] Nervous? How about that? You're welcome. All right. Two can play that game. Stick with your own side. - [chuckles] - Hey! - [bell rings] - I won, I won! Congratulations, young lady! This is your pinwheel. [carnival music] Have you ever seen that guy before? He's really cute. I think he likes you. - Oh, please. - Let's follow him. Are you kidding me? No! Come on, let's get out of here. Go get your book. You've got a big monologue to practice. Thou dost love... [lively music] [chatter] - Did y'all try this one? - Oh, gosh. Now, I know she's ugly, but she has a certain tang to her that's indescribably delicious. I wrote it off on style points alone. But we shouldn't talk about it now. Why not? Votes are in. We're just waiting on the decision. What do you think, Livy? I thought it was awful. [laughing] I passed it by too. It's the only pie I was sure about. Thank you, judges! I wanted you to be the first to know, your ballots have been tabulated, and the winner of this year's Harvest Festival Fair pie baking contest is, for her pecan pie... Sister Harriet Crane! [Charlie] Hah! I knew it. Second place goes to Mrs. Martha Windham's cherry chess pie. And our third place winner is Tilda Weston's gooseberry surprise. Oh! [Mrs. Abernathy] I'll be making the official announcement public shortly. But I wanted to thank you all again for your thoughtful and honest evaluations. Well done! What a nightmare! Grandma's pie isn't even in the top three. And to lose to another pecan pie? Relax, Olivia. I mean, we all judged honestly, right? I've gotta tell Grandma before the public announcement is made. [Man] Come on down and ride the hot air balloon today! You'll never get a chance to see a view from the sky like this! Come on down, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity... [carnival music] For you. [laughs] Why? Well, they didn't have a proper crown, and you deserve one. Silly old fool. I don't need a crown. I got you. Well, aren't ya gonna try it on? No. [gentle music] Oh, there you are! Oh, I've been lookin' for you. What is that? Grandpa won me a prize. What? I didn't think anybody could win these games. Oh, he knows how to beat all their tricks. Back spin. Pie contest must be over now, right? I-I-I wanted to tell you the results myself. I didn't win? How do you know? I sat on her pie. What? [Grandma and Grandpa chuckle] That crumpled gooey mess was yours? It was an accident. Ta! But I knew then that I didn't have a chance. I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me? She didn't want to taint your judgment. She knows how much this means to you. Grandma... Oh, not to worry, Daughter. God's will, I suppose. I have enough blue ribbons. It's time to pass the baton. After all, it's just a pie. I'll make us another one for Thanksgiving dinner. Oh, now, who won? Um, Sister Harriet. I've had her pecan pie. It's not bad. Not bad at all. You're doing good, Daughter. Well, for the record, I have to tell ya, Charlie Sneed was the only one who was brave enough to sample your pie, but he loved it. Oh, figures he would! The fillin' was 99% pure recipe, all thanks to a little help from the Baldwin sisters. Yeah. [laughs] Tell me what happened! [Grandma] Well, you see, we snuck into the tent... Why can't we do the ducks first? Well, I promised Edith we'd go on the Ferris wheel first, and maybe some other rides. Aww, really? [Edith] You'll love it, I promise. Yeah, like we can go on the carousel. Duck pond will still be there when we finish. - [Red] Five cents, five cents... - Hold on, there's my friend. And win a prize, folks, that's all there is to it. Step right up! I told you about him [unintelligible]. Yeah. Yeah, he looks kind of young to run this. But there's a big mean guy who... [gasps] [John-Boy] What? [Elizabeth] That stuffed bunny on the top! Okay, you know what? After the Ferris wheel. But what if somebody wins the bunny before we come back? You do not have to worry about that, sweetie, you know why? 'Cause we're going to the Ferris wheel. [Elizabeth] [giggles] [Boy] Come and get your ice pop! Ice pop! Mix and match your ice pop! I can't carry any more. Uh, here. Use this. That's it. How many do we have? Uh, I don't know. Maybe 40. Great, let's check in some other cans. [children shouting] [bell ringing] [Edith] Promise me next year we'll go on the bumper cars too. Yeah, next year for sure. Huh, Elizabeth? Here, your turn, your turn. - Oh my gosh! - [laughs] Come on, you didn't like the carousel? - Sorta. - What about the Ferris wheel? You can see the whole county from up top. It's my favorite thing. It's okay, I guess. Just okay, huh? Well, what if we got you another cotton candy, huh? You think that'd be okay? - No, thanks. - What? Really. I can't believe I'm hearing this. I know exactly what she needs. I'll be right back. Hey, Elizabeth, what has gotten into you? D-U-C-K? Okay, all right, I get it. Hey, Elizabeth! Elizabeth, don't you ever... Don't you ever run off like that again. - You hear me? - [Red] Everyone's a winner! Step right up. Hook a duck and win a prize. Quack, quack, quack! Look at me. I'm serious. Give me your hand. But it's gotten busier! [carousel music] Look what I got for you. [John-Boy] Wow, that is so nice. Isn't that nice, Elizabeth? Yeah, nice. Thanks, Edith. Now it's time to go to the duck pond! Time! Oh, I can't believe that slipped my mind. - [Edith] What's wrong? - It's four. We told the family we'd be at the talent show. - Let's go. - But it's not fair! Okay, I know, I know, Elizabeth. I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry. We'll be right back when it's over, okay? I promise. Promise. Okay, we gotta go. [eerie, high-pitched noise] [applause] Thank you, Bridie, thank you. For those of you interested, Birdie will be selling some firewood after the show that she has sawed. [audience chuckling] All right... oh, our next contestant is a 13-year-old aspiring actress who will treat us to a speech as Juliet from Shakespeare's classic Romeo and Juliet. Please welcome Erin Walton. [cheers and applause] [pants] What's wrong? [sighs] Perhaps, just perhaps, young Juliet was reacting to the discovery of her beloved Romeo's body in the family tomb. Um, let's... let's give Erin a hand, shall we? [applause] [Mrs. Abernathy] And bring on our next contestants, Erin's sister and brother. Please welcome Mary Ellen and Jason Walton. [applause] Hi, um... We'd like to share with you our favorite gospel song, In the Sweet By and By. [banjo intro] ♪ There's a land that is fairer than the day ♪ ♪ And by faith we have seen it afar ♪ ♪ For the father waits over the way ♪ ♪ To prepare us a dwelling place there ♪ ♪ In the sweet by and... ♪ [keeps playing] ♪ We shall meet on that beautiful shore ♪ [Both] ♪ In the sweet by and by ♪ ♪ We shall meet on that beautiful shore ♪ ♪ We shall sing on that beautiful shore ♪ ♪ The melodious songs of the blessed ♪ ♪ And our spirit shall sorrow no more ♪ ♪ Not a sigh for the blessing of rest ♪ ♪ In the sweet by and by ♪ ♪ We shall meet on that beautiful shore ♪ ♪ In the sweet by and by ♪ ♪ We shall meet on that beautiful shore ♪ [applause] [gentle music] Hey, thanks for bailing me out. Hey, just collaborating. [applause] [Adult John-Boy] As it turned out, the saw player and the cloggers won first and second in the competition. Mary Ellen and Jason salvaged enough of their performance to place third. But their moral victory did nothing to lift Erin's spirits. I know you're disappointed, Erin. But today's not the end of it. I'll never be an actor. You showed great instincts when you staged Mary Ellen and Jason on their song. So, we have an idea. Would you be interested in directing the children's play at Calvary Bible this Christmas? Me? Really? We could really use someone with your passion for the theater. That would be wonderful! I'd love to! We'll talk about the details this weekend after Thanksgiving. - Sound okay? - Oh, yes! Thank you, ma'am! Rose, Rose, how do you know she can direct? I don't know. But she can't now, she'll learn. [chuckles] You one special woman, Rose. - What's with you? - I'm gonna be a director! - Oh. - [John] Hey, Waltons! I just wanted to say regardless of who gets a ribbon or not, you're all thoroughbreds. And none of you need prizes to prove it. Now, I know there's still a lot you want to do here, so let's just make sure we all meet back up for fireworks before heading home. Clear? Okay, go have some more fun! Better get ready for that encore, Jason. Encore! [Jason] It's gonna cost you more chores! Congratulations. Thanks. Hope I didn't throw you off too much. Managed. Well, if you're ever in Rock Ridge County, look me up. Jimmy Donnelly. Anyway, just wanted to say hi. Hi. See ya. Bye. Well, what did I tell ya? Erin, don't be a... one of those. Well, I'm not! What did he say? Did he tell you his name? I mean, I already forgot it. Come on, you don't wanna miss the candied apples, do you? - I guess not. - I'll pay for it. - Really? - No. I don't have any money! I'm broke 'cause of you! [Red] Win a prize! All there is to it. Come on... [lively music] Hey, you made it. Now I'm gonna win that stuffed bunny. I should warn you, it's... harder than it looks. [John-Boy] He's right, Elizabeth, okay? I don't want you getting your hopes up. I have a good feelin' about it. [Red] All right. D-U-C-K pond, here we go. You've been talking about this all day. Are you excited or what? You got it, Elizabeth. A little slower. - [Edith] There we go, okay. - [John-Boy] You got it. - Ooh, so close, so close. - Be patient, patient! Okay. Come on, Walton, we're thoroughbreds, let's go! [laughs] [Elizabeth] [gasps] - I got one! - Hey! - Hey, look at you! - There you go. Number one, congrats! You can take anything you want out of this basket. Um, but I want the bunny. You have to hook a duck that says number three for that. But how do you know which one has a three? You don't until you catch it. There's some nice necklaces. That little bird is pretty. [Red] You want a necklace, then? Sure. Here you go. - Here, you can have it. - Oh, thank you! Can I try it again, John-Boy? Please? Okay. Ah... you sure you really want to? - Yes, I'm sure. - Okay. - Here you go. - All right. Try again. [lively music] It's okay. It's okay, Elizabeth. I don't get it. It's okay, just try again. Try again. [Elizabeth] I got another one! - [John-Boy] Hey! - [Edith] Nice. Let's see here. Number one? Again? Could I try it again, John-Boy? Just one more time, that's all, please? Fresh outta nickels, sweetheart. Sorry. Hey. I got something here that might just help your luck out. Is that the penny?! Yup, lucky penny. So I was told. Well, in that case, let me pitch in. After all, I got the necklace. Thanks, Edith. Here you go. Thank you. [Red] All right. Okay, give it another try. [lively music] [whispers] Hey, don't you know all those ducks are likely marked with number one? Yeah, but she's got a lucky penny. [John-Boy] You're right, she does. [bell rings] I'm so close... and I got one! Just hope it's a three. Number three, congrats! You win! What? What? The bunny! I want the bunny! - Uh, you got it. - I told you, John-Boy! - Yeah. - [giggles] Look at that. Here you go. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Here, I'm sure it still works. Thanks. Hey, thank you. You saw it there, folks! Everyone's a winner. Step right up! Hook a duck and win a prize! Quack, quack, quack! Red, get over here. But I'm about to go and... Now. [sinister music] - You think I'm blind? - No, sir. What the hell was that little girl doing with the top prize? I just thought it'd boost business, you know? People seeing a big winner and all. Whose business? I bet if I put your brain in a bird, it'd fly backwards. I'd never seen anybody so stupid. I just thought it might help. You're not here to think. Am I clear? - Yes. - Yes what? Yes, sir. There's a reason we don't let anybody win top prizes. You know how many suckers it'll take to pay for that rabbit? Not really. Well, you better bark up some of that business you've been yakking about. I don't want you leaving that booth 'til that prize is paid for. You get what I'm sayin'? - Get! - Aah! All right. What are you smiling so big for? [Maggie] JB! JB! Maggie? Maggie? Maggie? Maggie? [enchanting music] Oh, what's with the JB? It's a pen name, sort of. How are ya? Hey. - What are you doin' here? - Uh, Thanksgiving break. I didn't think I'd make it home until Zack offered me a ride. Who's Zack? College pal. He's down there throwing baseballs at a milk bottle pyramid trying to win me a bear. [shouting, chatter] Good for him. Uh, it's a really nice surprise seeing you. Yeah, I'll say. Hi, Maggie. Edith. How's my pack horse route? You take good care of my boy? I've been doin' my best. I'm still on the lookout for writing competitions. Thank you, I appreciate that. You haven't sent me one of your stories in a while. [John-Boy] Yeah, I, uh I've just been really busy with the harvest. It's... it's really busy. How did it go? It's all right, you know? We're doing, like, 20 bushels an acre, and that's not quite yielding enough, so we're gonna have to switch it up, plant some more acres, I don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's a whole complicated... You probably don't wanna hear about it. [Maggie] No, no, it's fascinating. [adventurous music] [Girl] Hey, can we play? Yeah, five cents. We're going to Zack's parents in Charlottesville for Thanskgiving. Um, if there's time afterwards, maybe we can get together? Yeah, we're... we're doing a big family Thanksgiving dinner with my grandparents too, so, um, we'll see, we'll see. I really hope you enjoy the rest of the fair, though. You too. Yeah. [laughs] Well, that was quite a conversation. [coughs] Yeah, I mean, I guess so, guess so. Elizabeth? Elizabeth, hey! I didn't see her leave. - [Both] Elizabeth! - [John-Boy] Hey! I'm gonna go check the duck pond. - You go there. - Okay. [serious music] - How do I look? - You look too comfortable. You are looking very royal. We should take the picture. Take the picture, sir. Whenever you're ready. [John-Boy] Edith! Oh look, there goes one of our royal subjects now. No luck. I've stopped several people. Yeah, me either. John, I think something's wrong. John-Boy? John-Boy? John-Boy, what's going on? Where's Elizabeth? Okay, about 15 minutes ago, she wandered off. Wandered off? Yeah, she was there for one minute, and then I don't know where she went. John-Boy, what in the world? - She was your responsibility. - I know, Momma, okay? I'm gonna find her, I promise you. I told her that she would meet me at the information booth if we got separated. Okay, let's... let's go, Edith. Oh, John-Boy. John, what if she isn't there? We shouldn't panic. Let's, um... Let's go to the information booth like John-Boy said and then we'll take it from there. [tense music] Oh! Ow... [bird caws] [leaves rustling] John-Boy! John-Boy! Now, she was last seen this side of the duck pond game. We've got enough of us to cover the entire fairgrounds if we fan out. Mom and Dad, I know you wanna help look, but I want you to stay here and... and... and watch for her at the information booth, okay? If she does show up like John-Boy says she might, I want her to see family faces right off. Any questions? Okay, let's scatter. Scatter in different directions! [leaves rustling] John-Boy! John-Boy, where are you? [owl hoots] [bird caws] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! She's about this tall. She has a red balloon with her. Sir, sir, I'm sorry... Have you seen a little girl with two ponytails, - about this tall, freckles? - Mm-mm. No? Thank you, thank you. Hello, uh, Elizabeth! - Elizabeth! - Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Let's try over here. Let's try over here. Madeleine! Madeleine, have you seen Elizabeth? She was with John-Boy. She just went missing. - You haven't seen her? - [Madeleine] No. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! I'm going to check on Selma at the milk can game. [tense music] [music turns gentle] [bird caws] [Red] Elizabeth! [tense music] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! [growling] [dark, tense music] [gasps] [growling] John-Boy! Anyone, help me! [growling] [Elizabeth] Help me! [pants] [growling] [Elizabeth] Help me! [pants] [growling] - [Elizabeth] Red! - You okay? [triumphant music] Yes. I found your bunny. Now let's get out of here. [Elizabeth] Thank you for finding me. I-I was so scared. [Red] You're safe now. [frantic chatter] [Olivia] John-Boy. [John-Boy] No, no. She's gotta be here somewhere. [triumphant music] Look! [family exclaiming] Elizabeth! Hey! That boy, he found me and he saved me. There were these awful animal noises, and I was lost, and it was so scary. And I heard something coming, and I thought it was a bobcat. But it turned out it was just the duck pond boy. And he got me out of there. We're just glad you're home safe, okay? I'm so sorry, John-Boy, so sorry. I shouldn't have run off like that. It's okay, sweetie, it's okay. - Hey, Momma... - Oh, not now, John-Boy. Oh, my baby, oh! [sinister music] Come here. That man is not his daddy. [Abner] What did I tell you? [Red] I'm sorry, I'm sorry! [John] Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do you know how much business we lost while you're out running around? [John] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What the hell you thinkin', mister? This boy deserves our thanks, not punishment. What he did for my daughter, you should be proud of that boy. It's none of your damn business. I'll tell you what, sir. You hurt him again, and I'm gonna make sure it is my damn business. [gentle, sad music] If you know what's good for you, you'll get your butt back to work. Right now! [John] Hey, hey, hey, hey. - I gotta go. - Yeah, it's okay. Hey, uh, I just wanted to say that what you did was was brave and was kindhearted. If he ever touches you like that again, you look me up, okay? My name is John Walton. I'll take care of it, okay? I just wanted to thank you for finding our daughter. It's okay. Mm... aww... [tender music] I really gotta go. [John] Well, hey, hey. Remember what I said. [Red] Step right up, folks! Five cents only. Back in business, folks. Five cents only. Everyone's a winner. Poor boy. [tender music] We're all back together. Okay. You all right? Good. [Red] Back in business, folks! Step right up. Everyone's a winner. Hey, Momma. I want you to know that, uh, no matter what you have to say to me, I've already said worse to myself. I now understand the true meaning of responsibility. I want you to know that. Nothin' like this is ever gonna happen again, okay? John-Boy, it's over. You know, my daddy used to say that takin' responsibility for your mistakes that's a sign of strength. Yeah. And so is forgiveness. Ah, we have so much to be grateful for. [fireworks bursting, whistling] Family's waitin'. [gentle music] [crowd cheering] [fireworks bursting, whistling] [gentle music] [owl hoots] Caught me red handed. [groans] What a day, huh? Elizabeth runnin' off like that. Scares me just thinkin' about it. Her lost, alone in the woods. You know, I still haven't talked to John-Boy. Oh, don't, his heart has told him all he needs to know. Going on about it won't... Won't help a thing. He's hard enough on himself. Yeah, I suppose you're right. [sighs] You know what? I just can't stop thinkin' about that duck pond boy. He took a huge risk going after her, and then, and then gets roughed up by that two-bit bully for it. Can you imagine what kind of life that kid must lead? No. And it breaks my heart. [knocking on door] Did you hear that? Somebody at our front door? At this hour? [knocking louder] I'll check it out. [sighs] Well, not without me. - Oh. - [gasps] Can I stay here tonight? I don't have anywhere else to go. [tense, dark music] [John] How did you get here, son? I walked. That's nearly six miles. Well, uh, I-I had to ask for directions, but, you know, everyone knows where to find the Waltons. He did that to you, didn't he? Y-y-yes, uh, you know, uh, when he's drunk, he... he... he hits me. [Olivia] Okay, we will talk about that tomorrow. Right now, just go to sleep. Okay, go to sleep. Oh, that's good. That's so good. [bright, gentle music] [whispers] Hey, Livy. This will not stand. I will see to it. [birds chirping] [rooster crows] Oh, he must be used to sleeping on the floor. Where do you think he went? You don't think he'd take off, do you? No, no, I wouldn't think so. Hey, good mornin'. Thought I'd do some chores, you know, pay you back. Huh. [gentle piano music] [Adult John-Boy] That morning at breakfast, we all heard Red's entire story. [Red] Abner and Selma put on a pretty good show for the folks at the orphanage. And it was okay for a while. Sure beat being trapped in that old gray building in Charleston. At first, it was... it was worth a lickin' now and then. Abner gets mean when he's been drinkin'. Only when things aren't going too well, and he takes it out on me. Sometimes Selma, but recently it's mainly been me. Happens almost every day. I can't even imagine. I know. That must've been so hard for you. It's okay. I get to travel a lot. I've been to, uh, Kentucky, Tennessee, and South Carolina, too. Workin' fairs and carnivals all over. That must be kinda fun. [Red] At first, but always feels like we're cheatin' folks. Then why do you do it? Abner forces me. Where else am I gonna go? [gentle music] Oh, heavens, let me get you another helpin'. - Thank you, ma'am. - Oh, you're welcome... Uh, I realize I don't know your name. Abner calls me Red, but I don't really like that. My real name's Ben. Well, then I will be right back with some more eggs, Ben. Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin', John? I'm thinkin'... First thing I'm doin' this morning is finding Sheriff Bridges and taking care of this Abner fella. That's not what I'm talkin' about and you know it. Yeah, yeah, I, uh, saw that look on your face at the table. We're gonna talk about it tonight. [bright, gentle music] Here you go. Thank you. Now, Ben, how would you like to stay here with us? Just until things settle down a bit. Tomorrow's Thanksgiving. There's plenty to do. And the kids, they can show you around. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Huh? [family exclaiming] Good. [Laughs] Good. [Mary Ellen] Word of advice? Don't listen to anything John-Boy says. [laughter] [John] That is good advice. [Adult John-Boy] We spent most of our time with Ben getting ready for the next day's Thanksgiving dinner. I think the Walton kids gave him the first example of family that he had ever experienced. And true to his word, Daddy saw to it that Abner was charged with child abuse. And his wife, Selma, was free at last to start a new life. Our daddy always did the right thing. [truck starts] [whispers] Is he still asleep? On the floor? We'll have to work on that. Yeah. [sighs] So what do you think? Of course, it'd be another mouth to feed. He does seem to get along well with the kids. If we take him in, I want it to be permanent. You up to that? Are we up to that? We do know the kid's got grit. The one thing about our family is knowing we have each other's backs no matter what. That is true. And in my view, he, uh... he has already proved himself in that regard. I would agree with that too. John I feel like he deserves a family that can love and support him, like he's never known before. Well, we do have plenty of that to spare. What do you think? [stutters] I'm not saying yes yet. I know. That kiss was because you're a good man, John Walton. Then I'm nothing without you. [lively chatter] They have something very special! They have something very special! Here it is! Yay! [applause] He wanted to make the centerpiece. That's very nice. That wingspan, use those wingspan. Oh, careful. Uh, Livy, would you mind leading a solemn prayer? Oh, I would love to. Let me have your hands. Our Heavenly Father, we have so much to be grateful for. We thank you for this day. We thank you for getting to be together. We thank you for everyone's health. We thank you for the crops this year, some of which grace our table today. We thank you most of all for this family, our love, and our heart. And today, we welcome in our very newest member, Ben. Shine a light on him, Lord, most of all. Let him know he's home forever. In your Son's name we pray, amen. - Amen! - Amen! Amen, Sister Jen. Shot a rooster, killed a hen. Hen died, the rooster cried. [Mary Ellen] Best part of the prayer! Hey, hey. Would you care to do the honors? It would be my pleasure. You and me, turkey! Fantastic, turkey time. Let me give you a little room here, a little elbow room. I don't want to get in your... [Adult John-Boy] There were many things we were grateful for that special Thanksgiving. But the real joy was being together. John-Boy? Come here, son. It's time for you to take over. [gasps] [family exclaiming] - Oh, you have to be careful! - [John-Boy] I will. Oh, honey! He'll be all right. He'll be all right. - It's all yours, Son. - Thank you very much. [lively chatter and laughter] [laughs] Y'all two should switch spots. Like, Jason, you're just too tall. Y'all need to switch. Oh yes, your sister's a director now. She, uh... she knows what's best. Well done, yeah. Thank you. [Olivia] That is actually better. I can see how that's better. I would like to say, let's eat. Oh! It's time for eating! [John] Napkins in lap! I'm fine. Listen... You are hogging the stuffing! [lively chatter] [Adult John-Boy] Momma and Daddy asked me what I thought about bringing Ben into the family before they finally decided, and if I could look out for Ben and be a big brother to him like I was to the rest of the kids. I was more than happy to do so. It took three months for the adoption paperwork to come through, and family life was not without some difficult adjustments at times. But thinking back on it, the honest truth is that our Thanksgiving table in 1934, Ben became a Walton. [gentle, triumphant music] [lively chatter] [Erin] Here's the green beans! [Olivia] That's good, load him up! That's right. [Erin] Good night, Elizabeth! [Elizabeth] Good night, Jason. [Jason] Good night, Jim Bob. [Jim Bob] Good night, Daddy. [Daddy] Good night, Livy! [Olivia] Good night, Mary Ellen! [Mary Ellen] Good night, John-Boy! [John-Boy] Good night, Erin! - [John] Good night, Ben! - [Kids] Good night, Ben! - [Olivia] Good night, Ben! - [Ben] Good night, family. [theme music] [WB fanfare]
