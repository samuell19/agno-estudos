Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm gonna tell you a story about a ghost, a werewolf, and if we're being honest, a pretty shitty pizza place. It all started when the werewolf came back to town. Fucker! Relax! It's Perfect Pizza Base. What the hell time is... ...as activist Justice 40,000 protested outside a local pizza restaurant... Pizza! Sons of bitches! Said you'd be here. Ah, Kingfisher! The most American of cities! Bustling industry, hardworking people, boundless opportunities. But being home to one of America's largest ghost populations isn't easy. Ghosts! But, thanks to Mayor Tracy's beautification of Kingfisher Project, we've turned this city around. Though we haven't had a werewolf, witch or demon in years, the mass grave at the former site of Halcyon Day Asylum left us with over 40,000 ghosts here in Kingfisher. In a masterstroke of brilliance, Mayor Tracy moved the ghosts into their own neighborhood just west of town. Fifteen city blocks of abandoned homes and businesses became Ghost Town. While the mass grave itself was paved over and turned into Halcyon Square Shopping Center. Now that's beautification! So this year, when you go to the polls, remember to vote Mayor Tracy. Kingfisher truly is a great place to be alive. I'm Mayor Tracy and I approve this message. Ladies and gentlemen, tragedy befell one of our citizens last night. With no provocation and no warning, one of our society's most vulnerable members, a pizza delivery boy, was murdered in cold blood while making a routine delivery in the Ghost Town neighborhood. The young man's name was Sean Hammerschmidt. Now police detectives have been working through the night and have collected evidence, that they are confident will bring the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice. Now this is a tragedy not only for Kingfisher and its various fast food concerns, but also for hopes of improved relations between the living and the dead. Now this may bring up for some memories of past incidents and to those who are concerned, I say, "Don't be an alarmist." Now, if you happen to spot the ghost of Sean Hammerschmidt, please contact local police immediately as he may be able to shed light on who killed him. You have all brought this upon yourselves by spurning the sins of the past. Halcyon Days have come to an end and penance will be paid! This will go down in the history books, you mark my words! Oh... Hey! Oh, hey, hey! Yeah, I was just getting some exteriors. I thought you could, you know, probably use them in your report. Mmm. You just get here? Yeah. Yeah. Anything interesting, or... A pizza guy was murdered. What... Wait, really? Yeah. They're making a pretty big thing of it. Sort of implying it was ghosts. Man, I hate ghosts. Jackson, your mom is a ghost. Oh great, yeah, perfect. Bring that up. There was this moment in there where this crazy lady started shouting about how the city was paying a penance and how we brought this on ourselves. It was so bizarre. What the fuck does that have to do with pizza? I don't know. Anyway, breakfast? Yeah. If you're buying. And I says to him, "You don't change the diapers, "the least you can do is buy 'em." And you know what he said to me? He said, "You don't change the oil in the Chevy Cavalier, "but I don't ask you to buy 10W30, do I?" And I said, "No." But that's not the same thing. Those two things don't even equivocate at all, do they? Yeah, your guy sucks. He used to bully me in high school so I always knew he would be a bad father. You need to watch out for those children. Well, he always liked you. No, he didn't. He signed my yearbook and wrote, "I never liked you. Don't forget it." I never did. Well, it's just like, here I am carrying the miracle of human life, your seed in my womanly womb, and you can't even buy diapers for the previous miracle of life that I myself ushered into this world? What's a six letter word for impregnable? Oh, God, don't even say the word "pregnant" right now, Astrid. I didn't. And it's just like, I'm so scared for the babies too. What with this awful murder and everything. Don't do that. I don't... She's right here. Can you all stop whispering? Oh, Astrid, I'm so sorry. I can see you're just sitting here strong. I didn't mean to bring anything up. Bring what up? Oh damn. Um... You know, Sean and the murder. Oh my God. I'm such a big dumb idiot. Baby, it's all over the news. ...in the killing of 24-year-old Sean Hammerschmidt, murdered late last night in the Ghost Town neighborhood. Police are saying they cannot confirm or deny ghost involvement. Whoa, whoa! What was that about? Geez. Ah, he's a pizza boy all right. How'd you figure that? Well, sir, I, uh, I deduced it on account of his uniform and that light on top of his car. That's outstanding. I'll be sure to pin that on my refrigerator at home. Are there any other notable police work you'd like to share with me? Well... Shut the fuck up. I guarantee this junkie loser is a pusher. This ain't the work of no ghost. The plot thickens. Shut the fuck up. Murder weapon been determined? It's a blade of some kind. Oh, is that right? Come on, lay off, Marsh. I won't know anymore until we get him back to the morgue. All right, let me make sure I got this straight. This poor son of a bitch has been lying here dead for the last eight hours and so far, this crack team of wizbangs has been able to determine that he is in fact a pizza boy and that his throat was slit with a blade of some kind. I have ulcers, Davis. I shit blood. Do you know what it's like to shit blood? Well, I did have a fissure in my ass once... All right, I don't want to hear about your ass, Davis. You started it. Detective Marsh! What the hell is it, Bradley? Davis here is telling me a compelling story about his asshole. Sir, I'm very interested by that, but you're going to want to see this. Cheese. Nice work, Bradley. Shut the fuck up. All right, Jackie boy. Here we go. Time to separate the men from the boys. Hey! Hey, guys! We think that since Sean is... You know. Dead! Right. Since Sean is dead, we think we should have the day off. Uh... Well, I appreciate your fearless feedback there, uh, but no can do, okay? We got to keep this crazy train on the rails. Where my boys at, right? Where my peeps? Look, Jack, we're scared. To death! Whoa! Heather! That's disrespectful. Sean is dead. He's right. Sean is dead. And I don't think I can deliver 'za under these conditions. I think you're making me do so is a violation of my human rights. What about you, big man? This your doing? It's true that there is danger in remaining open for business. When the unholy ground upon which we stand will doom us to the bowels of hell. Oh, God, come on, man! You want me to close down? You want me to shut up Perfect Pizza Base? That's not an option, guys. It's just not. Okay, fine. Take the day. I won't let them get away with this. Ladies and gentlemen, we stand on hallowed ground, for it is here that the 40,000 victims of Halcyon Days Asylum found their final resting place. It is here that the greater part of Kingfisher's ghost population originated. Souls risen from an unjust death and an unholy burial. Now inhabited by an even greater evil, that is capitalism. What she says is true. Our souls are bound to this place by the transgressions of the past by the unease of our corporeal remains. Until these wrongs have been righted, we will forever be stuck in a cycle of damnation. I get it. The asylum, the experimental torture, the mass graves. That's shitty, right? But we've been here for three years, okay? We're an institution. It's our time now. Well, let me tell you something. Mayor Tracy, tear down this abomination. Yes. Excavate and properly bury those who died here and perhaps you'll save your perfect pizza boys. Justice. Justice for the 40,000! Yes! That was great, Vera! Just great. Ms. Marcus? Sadie Sheridan, Kingfisher Chronicle. Can I ask you a few questions? You're a journalist? Yeah. I don't give credence to the corporate media machine. Ms. Marcus, you're simultaneously doing philanthropy for the ghost population and accusing them of conspiracy and murder. I'm not accusing them of anything. You heard the mayor. "Spectral involvement", he said. Yeah, but that was speculation. The possibility of spectral involvement. You seem to be very sure. Are you talking mess about me? Now you leave Ms. Vera alone, little Missy and you stop talking mess. I'm not talking mess, I'm trying to get to the bottom of your message. Get. I'm sorry? Get! Uh, hey, Sadie. Hey, what's going on? Just going to... You're taking too many cards. Just take, like, one. We're closed. Hey! Astrid. Jack, what's going on? It was a mutiny. Everyone left me, except for Joe here. So, here we are. Get 'em on the phone, Jacko. We're opening up. Hey, guys! What's the deal, Jack? I was at my much older girlfriend Shelly's house and she's pissed. Astrid's back. That drug addict? Oh, shit! Astrid, my bitch! All right, pussies. Mourning is over, so ya'll better suit because we are back in business. We're not doing this, Jack. Shit, I am. It'll be like old times. Scooter! Where's the solidarity, man? We're supposed to be doing this for Sean. Um, Heather, I know for a fact that you've never given a tuppenny fuck about Sean, or his well-being, so why don't you just save us all this little moral conundrum routine and do your fucking job. Yeah. Okay. I love this team! I love it! Relax, Liz. It's Perfect Pizza. They've opened back up. All right, Sean. Where were you going? Sir, I know you're upset, okay, but... Okay, yeah, but "60 minutes or less," that's just a thing. We don't actually mean that. Refund? Uh, no. Well, the joke's on you because my mother's dead. Son of a bitch! Been had! What do you mean? By Astrid, she came in here all gung ho about reopening this place and I'm getting calls left and right. No one's getting their pies. Looks like we'd better close it up. No, we're not closing it up, okay? We have Scooter. We're gonna be fine. Do you know how to drive? Hey, speak of the devil. My man! And he shall appear! Yeah. Hey, Shooter, let me ask you a question. You see Astrid out there? Because, uh, she left about an hour and a half ago and hasn't delivered a single pie. You don't think... No. No. I'm sure she's good. She's a street broad, tempered and raw shit. Yeah. Just like me. From the streets. I eat concrete and I piss steel. Yeah. Listen, Jack, uh, this last pie gets dropped off pretty close to my much older girlfriend Shelley's house. Think I can wrap it up after? Because you know it won't wrap it up during! Yeah! Hey, you shouldn't talk about ladies like that. But yeah, totally, call it a night. All right! Peace, bitches! Scooter. You must beware of the evils that live in the hearts of men. Evils as old as time. Evils that can steal from our essence. Making us weak, reckless, and negligent. Uh, listen, Joe, I was just playing. I always wear a rubber. No, Scooter. It is you who must listen. You forgot this order of Dave's Dangerously Delicious Dipping Sticks. Wow. Thanks, Joe. I almost lost my essence for a second there. Yo! I haven't seen you around here in a minute. Listen, Astrid, things have changed since you've been around. This dude's really dangerous. He's dangerous, how? You short him, you're dead. You blow the count, you're dead. You look at him cross ways, you're dead. So which one did Sean do? Come and get it, low lives! What's it gonna be, beauty queen? Sean Hammerschmidt. Sean Hammerschmidt! The fuck you say to me? You heard me. I don't know who the fuck you think you are, or who you imagine yourself to be talking to, but, um, this ain't that. But you killed him. Listen, I ain't in the junkie, lowlife disposal business, no matter what you've been lead to believe, okay? That's just not my bag. Oh! Fuck you, doll. Cops! Scatter. Drop the weapon. Hey, not so fast, Mr. Cheese. Hey, hey, hey! Cheese-eating son of a bitch, how you been? Met a friend of yours. What is everyone's fetish with this fucking guy, man? Hey. Let's talk. How long had Hammerschmidt been pushing for you? Listen, are you going to do anything about that little filly who just tried to decapitate me? This guy had your stuff in his car when he died. Lots of people have my stuff. That's the point. If I was the only asshole with my stuff, then I'd be some kind of a asshole. That's right. And you're not just some kind of asshole, are you, Cheese? I mean, you're a pretty exceptional asshole. A preternatural asshole. Mmm. This is abusive. I know all about you're little scheme. You got your delivery mules under your thumb, pushing smack for you and it is a good racket. Hey, you know, I don't give two squirts of piss what goes on over there in Ghost Town. A lot of booing and hooing, fuck all, but I got to a boy from Kingfisher whacked because of your bullshit. And, um, Mayor Tracy giving press conferences saying he's going to hand down justice, so... We got a problem. You and me. So... Come on, Cheese. Yeah. I know the dude. That's the spirit. But I swear, I had nothin' to do with the killing. Okay. Tell me who did. Shelly, it's the Shooter. I'm making some deliveries in your neighborhood. Can I swing by after for some of that sweet sauce? Perfect! A few years ago, some similar shit happened to a, uh, series of Chinese food guys. They'd take out their delivery and when they reached their destination, they'd wind up dead. Yeah, you mean, Yummy Yummy. Ah, so you know it. Then you know about the werewolf. I know he's long gone. Ah! Might want to check up on that, Detective. Some say he's back. Now... I'd say that's pretty funny timing, wouldn't you? Yeah, pretty funny. What the hell is he doing back here now? Folks ran him off years ago for doing the same thing. Maybe he's on a mission. Maybe he didn't like being ran out. Maybe he wants vengeance. Relax, it's Perfect Pizza! Find the wolf, you'll find your killer. Steve, we've got a fresh one. Another pizza boy. Ghost lady says that she saw a moped fleeing the scene. So, am I free to go? We got you at a drug dealer play date with an as-of-yet undetermined amount of narcotics. So... No chance. We have 187 in Ghost Town. Victim is a pizza boy. Issuing an APB for a possible suspect, Dax Lycander, armed and, well... He's a, uh, werewolf. Copy that, we're about two blocks away heading over now. Over. Yo, guys, I'm sorry. The whip was on the fritz. I couldn't make the deliveries. This is unacceptable. You are wrecking the reputation of this place! You're a real asshole, Astrid! Yeah, whatever. My bad. I got to charge you for those pies. Are you serious? I have six bucks. What else? A Gelato card. Needs more punches. Okay, yeah. I'll take that. And so it appears that the horrors visited upon a Chinese restaurant years ago in Halcyon Square Commerce Center have returned to menace a new generation of fast food employees. But what beyond geography is the connection between the two series of murders? To what do they owe their fates? And what of the emerging suspects? The city's ghosts and an accused werewolf long forgotten. How do they fit? Only time will bring the answer, and unfortunately, time is so far been unkind to Halcyon Square and its legacy. Got to get your areoles just right. Hey! Hey! Son of a bitch! Jesus, Vera. What the hell are you doing here? I'm sorry, Mayor. They just barged in. I'm here to talk about Halcyon Square, Tracy, like always. One of the damned ghosts killed another pizza boy last night. I'm aware. If we don't demolish that place soon, who knows what the ghosts are liable to do. They'll kill again! And that is blood on your hands, Tracy! Can you excuse us, please, Felicia? Of course. That was pretty good, Vera. Not so bad yourself. Debbie... Whoa! Yes! Support for Justice 40,000 is at an all-time high. Ah! These pizza boys getting murdered is bringing it to a fever pitch. Oh, this is good, Vera. This is very good. So, uh... So what's next? What's the play? More TV. We need people to keep thinking about these murders, to keep building support for demolition. Ah, well, now Vera, my public position is anti-demolition. You know, I can't be too hot in favor of the cause or I could lose constituents. I mean, Halcyon Square is huge potential development for the chamber of commerce. What are you saying? You like that money, Tracy? Oh, you know I do, Vera. Get on the god-damned tube and play the violin for these pizza boys. Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you that the tragedy that befell pizza boy Sean Hammerschmidt, befell another of his brethren during the wee hours of the morning. Thomas "Scooter" Martinez was making a delivery in the Ghost Town neighborhood when he was slain in a similar fashion to the previous killing. I have no choice, but to place certain sanctions upon Ghost Town and the ghosts of Kingfisher until someone is brought to justice. I am banning hauntings all together. I'm sorry, but my hand has been forced. They didn't even say why they think it's ghosts. So fucking lost. Maybe I can help. We're closed. On account of all of our people being murdered. Who the fuck are you? Sadie Sheridan, I'm with the Kingfisher Chronicle. Oh, hell no. No motherfucking journalist up in here. Actually, cool it. We could use the press. Hi, um, I think I probably overstated things. I said, "All of our people are getting murdered." It's just two. I'd really like to talk to you guys for a piece I'm working on about these crimes and maybe in exchange, I can show you what I've got. I just can't tell you what it means to all of us over there. Across the big divide to have living people standing up for us all. We're not so different. We've all got to die sometime, right? Yeah... Well, thank you for stopping by. Exhausting! Before long, no one in the community will be able to reasonably support that damned strip mall. Ah! Our latest inductee. Welcome. Do you have good news for us? So I plugged in the address and was blown away when it showed this store is in the exact same place. What did I tell you? I always knew this place had an exotic foreign feel to it. So it's not just a coincidence. Detectives aren't allowed to believe in coincidence. Investigative journalists either. So anyway, I kept reading about, assuming that unless it's a copycat, we might have the same perpetrator. And as it turns out, the police never got their man in the last case. Oh! So it is a coincidence. No. So then who was it? Well, in this case, they suspected an employee. A delivery driver who kept getting spotted at the murder scenes. What's more is he was a werewolf. What happened to him? No one knows. Disappeared. No one ever saw him again. Until last night. At the, uh, Scooter Martinez murder scene. A suspect fitting the description of one Dax Lycander was spotted fleeing the scene. I caught it on the police scanner. Son of a bitch! My biggest question in regards to him is, why? Well, he's a werewolf. Right? Aren't... Like, werewolves, they're, like, vicious. They eat people. I cannot believe what I'm hearing. Astrid, that is a stereotype, okay? So you got to put a dollar in the stereotype jar. Honestly, I don't even care why. Because if he killed Scooter, then I can guaran-damn-tee that he killed Sean. Looks like I'm going on a wolf hunt tonight. This blasphemous ground is the source of much malignity. Yeah, Bradley, I should have seen this coming. You know, I worked that Yummy Yummy thing years back and the damned wolf was our best suspect. God, I hate werewolves. Scum of the earth. Why werewolves? Because they're so scary? A werewolf killed my... My dad. Yeah. Yeah. I was just... I was just a boy. How'd he do it? Was it with his fangs and his claws and all that? Hit him with a car. Oh, my God. Intentionally? No, no... It was an accident. My father was a crossing guard with a taste for booze. That was his downfall. Sir, that's him. Don't just sit there. Let's catch that son of a bitch! Dax, what are you doing? Bradley! Get back here! He's a wolf! What are we thinking on, uh, on motive? Well, he's a thousand years old, Steve. He's probably very bored. We've got a witness that places you at the Scooter Martinez murder scene. And there ain't nothing you can do about that. Think you're smart, don't you? No, um, I'm attractive. I'm very muscular. Muscles for days, boss. Shut the fuck up, Bradley. How many of your guys died at Yummy Yummy? Six. Six. They were my friends. I looked after them. Got a funny way of showing it. I looked after you, too. That is rich. You hear that, Bradley? He's a hero. Listen, Steve... Can I call you Steve? Detective Marsh. All right. Listen, Steven, all you have a grudge and grudges don't hold up in court. Whatever you think, truth is, the cat you're looking for is still out there somewhere murdering people. And as long as you keep your eyes squarely off the fucking ball and on me, more people are gonna continue to die. And I don't think you're gonna feel good about that. I don't think your boss is going to feel good about that. I don't think the good people of Kingfisher will either. Fact still remains, I may have let them down, but I didn't kill them. I'm not a hero. I'm a fucking rascal. You know, you like to sit there and be a wise-ass. Cracking foxy. What kind of werewolf are you? Why don't you just grow fangs and murder your way out of here, huh? Come on, man. There ain't no full moon. What's wrong with you guys? If I was a werewolf, where would I be? Why would you do it, wolf man? Psst! Astrid. Sean? Oh, my God, come here. I was looking for your killer, babe. I was going to avenge your ass. Oh, how's that been going? Hey, what's going on? What are you doing with these creeps? Mmm. Mainlining dopey stuff. What? Chilling! I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I've heard rumors that one of the Yummy Yummy employees is a werewolf. You're still doing this shit? I thought you were done with that? Mmm. Come on, babe. Let's get the fuck out of here. Mmm... I'm going to take a hard pass on that. I'm good. And, uh... You can't always try and save me. You can't save me from this. Jackson, I need anything you have from that day at the rally, the weirdos. Should have fucking known, right? Not gonna change, Sean. Know what? You're better off dead! Astrid, uh... Look out. Holy shit. Did I die? Yeah, I think you did. Ah, shit! That fucking sucks! The deed is done. Well, I guess now we know it's him. What do you mean "now"? Hasn't it been obvious? You meat-headed shit sack. You know what, Detective Marsh? I have put up with a lot, but you are not going to talk to me like that again. I am an officer of the law and I deserve some respect! Bradley, when we get back to precinct, you're going to be on desk. What? Fugitive escaped under your watch and it's protocol until IA can figure out what really happened. I'm sorry. I suppose you noticed he broke the pattern. There's no delivery being made here. We've lost another young person to senseless violence. A young woman no less. No way. To be the bearer of bad news is one thing, but to feel as though one is the Grim Reaper is quite another. Having spoken with police about the matter, it is no longer reasonable to conclude that this is the work of a ghost conspiracy. I apologize for having made that mistake in early days and I will take care to not do so again. Thank you. Steve, someone here to see you about the pizza thing. Yeah, who is it? Somebody from the Chronicle. A journalist? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah, send him in. Hi, Detective. I'm Sadie Sheridan with the Kingfisher Chronicle. I have some information about the pizza delivery murders that I thought might be helpful to your case. So you've solved the crimes? Yeah, sort of. We need to stop them, right now. Who done it? Well, I assume you're looking at the wolf man, Dax Lycander, but it's not him. Wrong. Wrong. Well, just listen. No, you listen. That wolf escaped Central Holding. An hour later, we had another body. You had him? And he escaped? Well, how did he escape? It's neither here nor there. It's, um... It's impertinent to the facts. I have good reason to suspect this is a lot bigger than one motive-less werewolf. He's got a motive. Oh, there's a motive, all right. What's that? Well... He's very bored, for starters. This... This is motive. They've been trying to get Halcyon Square demolished for years. Scaring the shit out of people and giving them something to rally around is a brilliant method of getting... That's Vera Marcus. Yeah. That's Debra Saluski. I haven't looked at the whole roster, but yeah. That's five card-carrying cat ladies in need of a hobby. It's not a criminal conspiracy. I think that's incredibly reductive and not very helpful at all. Well... Thank you for dropping by, Miss, uh... Sheridan. Ms. Sheridan, but, uh... As you can see, I'm actually quite busy trying to catch a serial killing werewolf. So if you would excuse me. Yeah. Thanks for your time. I guess. Oh, and Ms. Sheridan... All of this was off the record. I better not see any of it in some paper somewhere. Yeah. I'm getting that a lot lately. Jack! What... What going on? Uh... Hey, Heather. Just hanging loose. Prostrated by the agonies of the damned. Why is the store closed? You don't know? God, you really don't know. Hate to be the one to break this to you because I know that you and Astrid were so tight. But, uh, she's dead. Yeah, just like the Shooter and Shawny. Oh, my God! I can't... I can't believe it. Well, you'd better believe it, sister. Looks like your best course of action is to head right out that door and never come back. And old Jackie boy and this pizza place are totally cursed. Joe can stay because he's as dead as a door nail. No one cares about you. You're probably right. Oh, um... I was gonna say, since I'm here, I think... I think I left something in the basement. The spooky basement? What the hell were you doing down there, you idiot? Um, it was a circuit... Caught fire. Yeah, so anyway, I think I left something. Do you mind if I go get it? Be my guest. Okay. What the hell is this? It's a classic kidnapping. Okay, I gathered that. Uh, do you know who I am? Yeah. And you're not scared? Bummer, but cool. So you're a reporter, right? Cut the shit, man. What do you want? Just chill. I suppose you know the police think that I'm the one going around doing all this murdering business. Truth is... You're not. But what they want to do is connect me to the murders with the... Yummy Yummy Chinese Cuisine. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Crazy thing, a little information for you. I know who's doing it and they're working with... Vera Marcus and Justice 40,000! God damn it! Can I speak? I've just... Why do you even know that? It's my job. Vera Marcus stirs up a fear machine to rally people against ghosts in an attempt to look benevolent, when really, she wants to destroy the strip mall for her own motives, as yet undetermined. Yes. I know that. Mmm-hmm. I know that as well. So technically, we're both right, right now about that. So what the hell am I here for? Because I need you to put that stuff in the newspaper, so that the police can get off my nuts so that I can go back to living a normal life. I'm working on it, man. But kidnapping me isn't exactly conducive to me getting work done. It's dramatic though. Yeah. I'm gonna go, if you don't mind. Wait, uh... Uh, are you going to help me? No offense here, but you are a werewolf, right? Why don't you, I don't know, take care of Vera? You want me to murder someone. Yeah. I guess I do. I'm not that kind of werewolf. Right. What kind of werewolf are you? The kind of werewolf that wants to deliver quality Chinese food at affordable prices. That's quality Chinese food. Affordable prices. I just want to be like everyone else. I love how proud you are of your body. Jesus, Vera! Why are you here? Okay, it's late and I am very busy. Vera, what's with killing a girl? I thought we said enough was enough. I've had it, okay? You can have your money back. Partnership terminated. The rest of the money's already deposited though, so that's... You'll just have to let that go. I don't want the damn money. It was your loyalty that was important. Your utility. And now you're neither loyal nor useful. Well, sorry, but there's political savvy and then there's just madness, and you are clearly moving toward the latter. And what am I to do now? My biggest political ally has tossed me to the wind. This is detrimental to the divine plan of things. Well, I don't know what to tell you, but the Lord works in mysterious ways. Is that so? It is what they say, now could you just get out of my office? Is it the Lord working in mysterious ways, Tracy, or... Is it the Devil working in obvious ways? What? Think about it. Santa and God? Same person. 'Cause once you get older, they both fuck you. Big time. Oh, no, no, no! Not you again, okay? Last time you came in here, you asked a million questions and you didn't order a damn thing. Let me take a moment to educate you about the Perfect Pizza Base menu. I appreciate that but I actually have some pressing questions that don't pertain to your menu. Oh, really? Well, I got a scoop for you. Put pineapple on the Papa Pepperoni and you get a Mrs. Jones! Jack, a killer has been targeting your store. What the secret of our jumbo slice? It's just two slices. They've been targeting it for years. It's this place. We need to investigate this. I run a legitimate business, okay? There's nothing evil about this place. It is this place that is the source of the evil we face! The legacy of terror beyond Perfect Pizza, or Yummy Yummy or even Halcyon Days. The time mourned in enduring bequest of bloodshed that has emanated from beneath the floorboards, or the footings or the gnome. These have not been coincidences, but the birthright of every institution that would make such malevolent dregs its home. Joe! I'm trying to make a sale over here, okay? Zip it with all that mystic voodoo shit. That's exactly what I'm talking about! That's why we have to investigate this place. I didn't even hear a word he said. That shit is real! It's beneath the floorboards. Okay, you want to go beneath the floorboards, it's gonna cost you. Yes. Yeah, uh... I don't know, guys. It's, uh, pretty spooky down there. Like, very spooky. Ugh! What's that smell? Sulfur. Gross. No! Oh. T-shirts! I told you they were down here. What? No. You go. Fine. All right. What's the big idea? Who the hell are you? And what are you doing in my basement? Your basement? Who do you think you are? Uh, I'm the guy who pays rent on this place and I don't remember hiring a creepy old dude to hang out next to my furnace. Well, I'm Carl, asylum janitor and gatekeeper to Hell. Oh, asylum janitor. He's a ghost. Wait. Gatekeeper to what? Hell. Gatekeeper to Hell. And what do you mean "ghost"? I... Oh! Oh! Son of a bitch! I am a ghost. Can we divert our attention back to the fact that this is a gateway to Hell? Wait, so you're telling me that my pizza place is built on a gateway to Hell? I've been saying that. What? Never. You never said that. Well, if it's on this lot, then yeah, your pizza place is a gateway to Hell. Congrats! You know, there really aren't that many here, Arizona. There are a bunch of them in Florida. Heather. What about Heather? Heather? Oh! Yeah, I know Heather. She, uh, she dropped by, you know, said she was trying to access Hell and I says, uh, "Come by the next full moon." "I'm your man. "Carl." Why is she trying to go to Hell? Oh, I don't know. Something about making a slave army of ghosts. Spooky business, you know, run of the mill, Hell stuff. World damnation. End times. Good God. No, no, no. Just Satan. Okay, Tracy. Look alive! Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I hope this message finds you well. Today I have no news of a young person's death to share. For that we can all be grateful. Today, I do need to share with you though the truth about my own wrongdoing. Now, for the past month or so, I have been in cahoots with a certain local organization... Ladies and gentlemen, this man is a fraud! Justice 40,000 is the group to which I am referring. For years this man has stood on this very stage and spouted anti-ghost rhetoric, sanctioning Ghost Town, and most recently, accusing the ghosts of a murderous conspiracy. Now I apologized for that. But you may notice something strange. Something different. About your anti-ghost mayor. Can anyone venture to guess? He's a ghost! Tracy is a ghost! Okay, ladies and gentleman, can we please just all move past the fact that I'm a ghost. The punishment has only just begun, Tracy. But she killed me! Also, she's a witch! Mayhem sweeps through Kingfisher. The news of Mayor Tracy and Vera Marcus' dirty dealings has set off a haunting spree. The likes of which the city has never seen. The city's ghosts, victims of the ongoing media conspiracy have taken to the streets, terrorizing the living as they go about their business. Meanwhile, a vigilante assassin has taken up the banner of killing witches, managing to eliminate half of the Justice 40,000 coven in a single night. The remaining witches have gone underground. As law enforcement prepared, should Vera Marcus access the portal to Hell she so covets? Who knows what horrors may be unleashed. As the full moon nears, we wonder if the now exonerated pacifist werewolf, will use his supernatural talents against the evil forces at work. Only one thing is certain, Kingfisher needs a hero. Boo! Shit! God damn! What's wrong with you? Calm down. I'm just trying out a new thing. You don't like it? No, I don't like it. Who are you? I'm one of your victims. You don't remember me? No, I don't remember you 'cause I don't have any victims. What are you doing here? I know. It was the fucking witches, I'm well aware. Right. Yeah, so, what's the story, bro? I mean, this is something you could have ended a long time ago. Honestly, this is something you should have ended a long time ago. No one else was doing it. The implication is that it's me. 'Cause it's my job. Right... Maybe I'm not so fast and loose with my morality. Did you ever think about that? And by morality, you mean letting people get killed while you ride around on your fucking tricycle? High performance machine, maybe. This isn't about us finding some fucking minions and slaying them at their tea party This is Vera. And she's into massive shit and we need to stop her. We? Yes, we. Who the fuck else? Me and you. Mmm, no thank you. What the fuck kind of werewolf are you? The kind of werewolf that knows how to quit when he's ahead. I deliver fucking Chinese food. And? Look, the point is, I spent my whole life... People trying to make me a hero or a villain. And I've realized at this point, I'm neither. And as far as I'm concerned, my name is cleared. So, if this is your mission, do you. Okay. Hey! Sadie. Yeah. What? Uh, hey. You okay? Yeah. I just had fucking ghosts haunting my apartment all night. What's going on? No doubt, yeah. Um... Well, listen. You know, Uh... You know the sports guys Donald? No. Well, um, he was murdered. And they just wanted me to ask you if you wouldn't mind covering sports beat until we, uh, find a new guy. Sports? Mmm-hmm. A whole city in chaos, which by the way is the very reason the sports guys is dead and you want me to cover, what, a football game? Well, hey, okay, listen, don't shoot the messenger, okay? It's just, it's a big readership thing. And plus, I think it's a basketball game. I have more important things to write about. Living-dead relations, witchcraft, werewolfery. Oh, we got the pros up here. They're handling that. Sadie. Sadie. Well, wave your goodbyes, Joe. We barely knew ye, Perfect Pizza Base. We had some good times, didn't we? Before the staff murders and before we found out you were a direct line to the Dark Lord Satan. Jack, we must not leave the portal unattended. We must be watchful guardians of this terrible place. I can't afford it, Joe. Okay, look, you know, us living people got to do a little thing called paying taxes, okay? So, let's pack up our shit and get out of here. Plus, doesn't Carl the janitor do that? Jack, you must believe me. We are the only hope for the community and the world at large! Congratulations. You got me. You did it, you got the big bad wolf. Relax, Dax, I'm... I'm not gonna arrest you. No, I, um, I never got to thank you for what you did the other night in Ghost Town. You know, my boss has had it out for you since the beginning. I can't change his mind. Once some people get an idea in their head, they just can't shake it. Frankly, I still believe cats can speak English. They just choose not to. Clever sons of bitches. The point I'm trying to make is sometimes seeing is believing. You've got power in this situation. You can change this whole town's perception of you. Or you can leave. Either way, it's no skin off my cat. What did you say? I think you heard me. Trust you'll do the right thing. The time is neigh, sisters. We shall summon the Dark Lord Satan back to the Earth from whence he fell. I can feel it. Can you feel it? Feel what... I can. Debbie, go check it out. Why me? Damn it, Debbie, Do it. Do this, Debbie. Do that, Debbie. I'm the best witch, Debbie. ...Debbie. Wear more than two shirts a week, Debbie. Who in the hell are you? I'm Jack and I'm the owner of this establishment. You're not taking me alive. Jack, you must not do this. My mind's made up. No witches are going to access Hell on my watch. Jack, you don't understand. You've been a good friend, Joe. But damn you. Damn you, witches! Damn you for taking delicious pizza from the fine people of this town! Holy... Well, that's one way to do it. I don't get it. Why isn't it gone? Damn you, Jack! What? What did I do? Someone's done us a favor, Heather! Oh! You imbecile! We're on the same side! Can't you see? We're both agents of evil. Oh no, sister. I'm just a brokenhearted broad on a mission for justice. And you think you can handle the malevolence of Hell all by yourself? Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Heather? Oh, you bitch! Now, let's do away with this woman scorned. So, you are real. Where you been? I've been dying to kill you. Every dog has its day, but not today. Yeah, Jackson. This is Sadie. I've got a scoop and I want a fucking promotion. Oh, thank God! I was being held hostage by these crazy people, these witches, and... Nice try. Yeah. Godspeed, you Chinese food werewolf. Sometimes villains hide in plain sight. And sometimes our heroes are unlikely. The events of the full moon brought out the best and worst of Kingfisher. A city brought to its knees by arbitrary divisions and wayward ambition. Ultimately saved from annihilation by a ghost and a werewolf. And a journalist. I was just doing my job. For Kingfisher Channel 4 News, I'm Sadie Sheridan. We'll be back in a moment. From the ignominious end of Perfect Pizza Base, comes Jack's Perfect Pizza. Hey! I'm Jack and I want you to come on down... Mmm. And eat a slice of Jack's Perfect Pizza. That's right. We've got ourselves a brand-new place and this time, it's not on the site of an illegal burial ground. Not to mention, a portal to the abyss! That's right, we've moved from our old location, which I definitely didn't burn down for tax purposes. I'll tell you this right now, I wouldn't want any other pizza to be sliding out of this gaping wound in my neck, except for Jack's Perfect Pizza. The pies are hot, the workers are friendly, and so far, zero employee murders. It's clean as a whistle! And we never allow witches in. Excuse me? I'm a witch. Get out of here, witch! See? So come on down to Jack's Perfect Pizza, Kingfisher's new 'za! Our pizza is to die for... But we hope you won't! Subtitles by explosiveskull
