(Insects chirping) (Metal scraping) - Are you OK? I heard a sound. Did you hear something? (Gasps) (Screaming) (Panting) (Car honking) (Honking) (Birds chirping) - This is one of the best neighbourhoods in Chicago. It's got great shopping and restaurants and schools. Ha! They are some of the best in the city. - I don't have kids. - Well, then there is plenty of time to shop and eat out. Like I said, this is a steal. The owners they've already, you know, lowered their asking price, and they are super motivated. - Yeah, I bet they are in this market. - Well, make an offer. You know, come in low. (Clears throat) There's plenty of wiggle room. - Look, I don't want to waste your time. I'm not about to make an offer on a property that will be in foreclosure soon. I'm just checking it out, I'll see if I'm gonna want to make a bid. - Did your homework, huh? Well, the owners haven't hit bottom yet, and for all we know, the market hasn't either. - Oh, I'll take my chances. - Well, if you change your mind, you, uh... - I got your card. (Sighing) (Cell phone ringing) - Hey, Maddy. - Hey, how did it go? - Oh, it could've been worse. Five people came through. None of them were buying though. They already smelled foreclosure. - So how could it have been worse? - Four people could've come through. But I gave somebody my card. So, you know, if the market revives then-- - Oh, it'll revive. Just maybe not in our lifetime. - And how did it go there? - I made it through an exceptionally steamy romance novel and got a good start on the sequel. Those Victorians, they sure do know how to, um, be inventive. - Don't worry about it. It's gonna pick up. - Oh, it'll pick up. Just maybe not in our-- - OK, you know what? Thanks, Eeyore. Bye-bye now. (Chuckling) - Good night. - (Whispering): Man! (Sighing) (Sighing) (Cell phone ringing) (Ringing) - Mr. Adams. Yeah. Yeah, I got a good start on it today. Well, the lacquer looks good, really brings out the grain. I think you'll be pleased. Yeah, well, you can come by any time tomorrow. I'll be on site all day. Uh, you'll have to talk to the other trades about their work. I just, uh, I just focus on my own. OK, you too. (Beeping) (Panting) (Siren in distance) - Hey, babe. - Aren't you making dinner? - What? - I thought you were gonna make dinner. - Uh... (Sighing) Let's go out tonight. It's been forever since we went out. - How did it go today? - Uh, well, you know, some days you conquer the blank page and some days it conquers you. - Francois, you're a writer who isn't writing and therefore isn't selling. And I haven't moved a property in 4 months. That's why we don't eat out. - We'll put it on plastic. - We don't have disposable income. We don't have income. You know, I'll just-- I'll make something. - No, no, no... Don't do that. I'll feel guilty. (Sighing) (Drawer opening, dishes clinking) - You think it's a coincidence Sudoku became really popular just as the economy tanked and suddenly everyone has all this free time on their hands? I don't think so! - What you doing? - Tweaking the website. - Ooh! - I look fat. - It's the Internet. It adds 10 pounds. - I thought that was television. - Ah, it's the same difference. - Liar. - Girl, you are in the wrong business. You should be designing Web pages. - This is just cut and paste. - But it's knowing what to cut and paste. - My cousin is a web designer and her business is down, too, so... - How encouraging. You know what? There is only one known cure for my anxiety, and my biological clock says it's time for lunch. Can I bring you something back? - No, I'm good. - Bye! - What did you forget? - Uh, nothing as far as I can tell. Oh, I'm sorry. Um... (Chuckles nervously) Hi! I'm Lauren Baker. - Sean Crawford. - Ah! What can I do for you, Mr. Crawford? - Well, you can start by calling me Sean. - Oh, well, what can I do for you, Sean? - Tell me you're a realtor. - I'm a realtor. - Then I've come to the right place. - Are you buying or selling? - Selling. - OK, and commercial or residential? - Uh, residential. - Great. Is it an apartment or a house? - It's a house. - OK, and the address? - 153 Renwood. - That's a Burr Ridge address. - You know your market. - Uh, is it a single family? - Yes. Um, you're gonna need the specs, and there's a lot of them. It would probably be easier if I just showed you the house. - OK. - OK, when would be a good time? (Chuckling) - Mr. Crawford... Sean. I'm a realtor. It's always a good time to see a Burr Ridge house. - This is it. (Over phone): I just wanted you to get the full impact of the curb appeal. - Wow! Yeah, curb appeal and then some. -All right, follow me. We'll park at the back. - Wow! - I get that a lot. - Yeah, I bet. - My sister and I inherited the house when our parents died in an accident two years ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I'd like to say it was something tragically romantic, you know, caught in an avalanche, scaling Everest. But no, it was just a stupid head-on collision on the Ryan Expressway, a drunk driver going in the wrong direction. - That's terrible. - Yeah, especially since Dad was the drunk driver. But Rebecca and I don't live here anymore. I have my own apartment. She's out in LA. We would've sold the place two years ago, but the estate was all tied up in litigation thanks to the accident. - Did you grow up here? - If you can call living with 2 selfish, neurotic, insanely narcissistic parents "growing up". (Chuckling) It's a Murano. Venetian glass. (Chuckling) - Yeah, I--I knew that. - All the zany stuff in the house is Mom and Dad's. They loved to travel to exotic places, you know, anything to escape the responsibilities of parenthood. (Sighing) I'd like to say I have a lot of fond memories of this place, but I don't. I don't feel connected to it at all. - Well, that's too bad, 'cause this is a beautiful house. - I dropped them off here over 3 months ago. They were gonna hike south for 6 weeks and then double back and contact me to come and pick them up. But it's been over a week now, and I haven't heard anything from them. - It's not unusual for there to be delays on the trail. It's a long haul. - Yeah, but see, with them, it just doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem right at all. - If anything did happen to them on the trail, we could be searching for a while. - I'll help. However long it takes. They're out there somewhere. They gotta be. - Our inheritance was substantial, so we're not looking to make a killing. We'd like to price the house competitively. - I understand, but this is a pretty special property. I mean, houses like this rarely come on the market. And as your realtor, I would recommend that you-- - Uh, who says you're our realtor? - Oh. I thought that-- I guess until we sign an agreement, I'm not. - Why don't we discuss it over dinner? My treat. Come on, it's the least I can do since I interrupted your lunch to show you the house. And... You're a very attractive woman. I'd like to get to know you better. - Look, um... (Clears throat) I have a boyfriend. We live together. - But you're tempted? - Sure. I mean, you're--you're pretty darn attractive yourself. And this house represents a huge potential commission, so... - Oh, so you would consider sleeping with me to get the listing? - I mean, I might. Would--would it work? - It might. - You know, uh, Oscar Wilde, he once said that he could resist everything but temptation. But I can. And, you know, I gotta look at myself in the mirror. - Well, from where I'm standing, that sounds like an enjoyable experience. - You get my point? - Unfortunately, yeah. (Sighing) - Look, I'd really like this listing, Sean. And I think I would do a terrific job. - I have your card. (Birds chirping) - Well... Let me know. (Siren in distance) - Morning! - Morning, Maddy. - I'm mad at you. - Mad at me, why? - For holding out on me. I though we were B.F.F.s. - What are you talking about? - François. - What about François? - Why didn't you tell me he's been cheating on you? - What? - Why else would he be buying you roses? - Oh! Aw! It's not from François. "You can't blame a guy for trying." - What guy? - Our new client. - You got a listing! (Laughing) - Oh boy, did I get a listing! I can't believe this! (Both giggling) We believe that the price point on the house is realistic. It's gettable. I mean, like I said, houses like this rarely come on the market. It's a unique property and it'll take a unique buyer, but they're out there. - OK. I'll have to run the numbers by Rebecca, but I'm good with it. Uh, no ads and no public notices. You know, in this neighbourhood, it's important to be discreet. - Oh yes, buyers in this price range rarely read ads and they prefer to work through realtors. - And don't show on Tuesdays. That's when the caretaker comes. - Yeah, got it. (Cell phone ringing) - Excuse me. Hello? Yes. I was waiting for your call.... - Do you have any idea what the commission's gonna be? - I know. I keep calculating it in my head. It's like the decimal's in the wrong place. - Hmm! - That's right. Trust me, it's an amazing location. OK, let us know if you do. - No, we can't give you the exact address without buyer interest. The clients wants to keep it confidential. Yeah! No, I agree. Just find us a lucky buyer. OK. Yeah, you too. Wow! There is a lot of hungry agents out there. Yeah, if only they had some qualified and interested clients. - Oh, come on. We've only been at this a week. Tell me, when was the last time that you saw a house of that quality in that neighbourhood come on the market? - I... Never. - I understand that the rich people out there have a lot less money than they use to, just like the rest of us, but they're still rich. We'll find a buyer. - You know what? There is only one known cure for my anxiety. - Do you want some company? - What, you're coming with me? You're buying your lunch now? - Oh, unlike you, I've got some hope for my economic future. (Phone ringing) - If that is my mother, tell her I've already gone to lunch. - In The Loop. This is Lauren. Yeah, that's right. Yes, yes. It is still available. Well, uh, what time works best for you? Oh, 3:00? Yeah, that--that's perfect. OK, is this your cell number? All right. OK, then I will text you the address. Uh-huh, yeah. OK, I'll see you there. That was a Mr. Ahmad Khashan's secretary. Apparently he is very interested in our latest listing. - Which agency? - Oh, no, it's not a agency. He was referred to us by the Saudi consulate, that "harebrained idea" of mine I think you called it? - Oh my god! That's a double commission. (Laughing) - Well, he hasn't bought it yet. He's just looking. - He's buying it even if I have to sleep with him. - What? - You are the scruples half of the team, girl! (Both giggling) - And that is a-- - Murano! Very original. (Chuckles) Are they selling the house furnished? - Well, that's negotiable. - And the price. It's negotiable? - Ah, up to a point. Don't need to tell you how special this house is. You're not gonna find another one like it. - Are there others interested? - Of course. - Show me more. - OK. Sean? Hi, this is Lauren. Hey, I've got some good news. We got an offer. - Already? That was fast. - Yeah, he's offering 10% below your asking price. - Ah. - Well, but--but listen. It's cash. - You're kidding me. -Well, he's motivated. He's, uh, the new Saudi consul, so he's moving with his family from Riyadh and so he needs to move quickly. And you know what? He'll even buy the furniture. - Well, if it's a cash transaction-- - Escrow will be a breeze. We can move fast. - Should we counter? - Well, you know, ultimately, that's up to you, but, uh, I wouldn't be too aggressive. If he's the real deal, he's gonna be the perfect buyer. - Let me talk to Rebecca, see what she thinks. -OK. All right. (Cell phone beeping) - Maddy? Hey, are you sitting down? Mmm! Something smells good! - Only the best for Chicago's finest realtor. - You-- Oh! You are so sweet. Look at these! -Un Bordeaux. Your favourite. - Thank you so much. -Félicitations.

We have a location on the two missing hikers. (Bird chirping) - Dental X-rays should tell us in a few days if it's them. - It's them. I know it's them. - They've been out there a month or two at least. The coroner will determine approximately when. Listen, uh, when he does determine an approximate time of death, you're gonna be asked to account for your whereabouts at that time. Just giving you a heads-up. - Yeah, I understand. - It's been a long time since anything like this happened on the trail. Never on my watch, that's for sure. (Ringing) - Hey. - Hi, Sean. I'm here with your attorney. - Good morning, Mr. Crawford. - How does it look? - We're in great shape. The title couldn't be cleaner. - Fantastic. I'm at the house, taking inventory. I should have a price on the furniture by tomorrow. - Ask a fair one. He can afford it. - So, we're still on target, amigo? - Should be. Things move fast when there's no loan to process. - I'll have Rebecca book her flight. - (Lauren): I'm sorry she has to fly out for closing. It's the law. - It's not a problem. And listen, I'll have her fly in the night before. Let's go out and celebrate on me. Bring Maddy, Lauren, and your boyfriend. - Thank you! That's a great idea. - I appreciate the offer, Mr. Crawford, but I have a late meeting that night. - Gotta go. I'll talk to you both later. Hello! Can I help you? - I'm the caretaker, Tom. - Of course, Tom. Tom Cross. Hi! It's me, Sean. - Sean? I barely recognize you. - Eh, it's my retro-hippy look. And how long has it been? - Ten, fifteen years at least. Ever since you went off to prep school, I guess. - I was a kid then, Tom. I grew up. - Ha! I guess so! Man, I remember you and Jimmy kicking soccer balls out on this drive like it was yesterday. - Hey, I thought you came on Tuesday. - Usually. Had to switch things around this week. - So what are you doing here? - We're selling the place. - Selling? - Yeah, I was gonna contact you when things were finalized. - Ah Makes sense. Houses were meant to be lived in. - Exactly. So how's the family? - Well, uh, Jimmy's still here in Chicago. Has his own place, but he keeps in touch with the old man. I'll tell him you're in town. You two can have a beer and catch up. - Sounds great. Uh, speaking of beer, it's 5:00 somewhere. Why don't you come in? You and I can have a beer and catch up. - Uh, I don't know.

Yeah, yeah, pretty near. - Oh, funny! - So how about you, Frederick? - François. - Oh! I'm sorry! I am so A.D.D. when it comes to names. What do you do? - I'm a writer. - Oh, wow! What have you written? - I'm best known for The Fifth Temperament. It's a novel. It did well a few years ago. - Oh! - He's being modest. It was a best seller. - That is so awesome. - Yeah, but that was then and this is now. I'm working on a new novel. - Well, you have to let me know when it's done. I would love to read it.

But is he as good at resisting temptation as you are? - Well, you'll have to ask him that. - You sure you don't want something stronger? - No, I have to drive us home. You know, Sean, I've been meaning to ask you: Why did you pick us? "Experience, Diligence, Integrity: "Our credentials and our promise." - You checked out our website? - I liked your presentation. And I wanted to go low-key. You know, like I said, in our neighbourhood, it's important to be discreet. Use one of the standard realtors, and within 5 minutes everybody knows you're selling. - Well, whatever the reason, I'm glad you did it. - It was a real game-changer for us. Uh, for me. It pretty much saved my ass. - Well, it's an ass well worth saving. - As anyone ever told you you're an incorrigible flirt? - Incorrigible flirt? - Yes! - That doesn't sound very sexy. - Don't worry about it. You've got the sexy part covered. - Didn't work on you. - Well, if circumstances would've been different... - I'll settle for that. - Seriously, Sean... Thank you. Thank you so much. (Cell phone beeping) - Yeah, it's me. Yeah, I just got here. Of course I called first. No, there was no answer. Dad! No, I don't know. Look, I'm just gonna get the spare key and I'm gonna go and check it out, all right? Well, I'll let you know if I see him. OK, bye. Dad! Dad! - (Woman on CB): Twenty-five, twenty-two. - When was the last time you spoke to your father? - We, um, we talked on the phone. I don't know, maybe beginning of last week? - Does he live alone? - Yeah, he has-- He has for some time since my mom and him split up. That's why I check on him regularly. You know, to make sure he's OK. - So you spoke to him last week. - Yeah, actually, I called him two days ago and left a message. When he didn't call back, I got worried. He's really good about returning his messages, so I... dropped by to see what he was doing. - (Man on CB): No problem. - Good morning. Mr. Crawford. - Good morning. - And Ms. Crawford. - How very nice to meet you. - I assure you, the pleasure is all mine. - All right. Are you ready? - Thank you. - No, thank you. - Congratulations! - Congratulations. - Pinch me. - Oh, I can do better than that. (Cork popping, both squealing) (Screaming) (Laughing) - How did I do? - You even had me convinced you were my sister. (Giggling) - Oh! (Moaning) Mmm! (Moaning) Oh! (Sighing) Oh! (Siren in distance) - What the hell was that? You OK? - Maddy, have you seen the newspaper this morning? Just go and get it. - "The remains of two hikers recently discovered "on the Appalachian Trail "have been identified as "those of brother and sister Sean and Rebecca Crawford." (Door opening) - Hello? Can I help you? - Who are you? - Who are you? - I'm the owner of this house. (Scoffs) - Well, that's impossible. (Cell phone beeping) - (Female voice): We're sorry, but the number you have dialled is no longer in service. - What? Damn you, Sean! - I have a signed contract! The title and deed are in my name! - I understand, Mr. Khashan-- - I gave them a certified check for almost $10 million! - Hello? And you are? - That's the realtor. - (Detective): OK, let her in. - I gave her and her partner a large check as well. - Yeah, I-- - Det. Halverson, CPD. You are? - Uh, Lauren Baker. I represented both parties in the sale of the house. - But your sellers weren't qualified to sell. They didn't own the house! - They were imposters, Lauren. - But we checked him out. - No, their attorney did! - And he was an imposter too. They knew the real Crawfords wouldn't turn up to ruin their plan. - (Ahmad): Because they killed them! - I'm Garrett Crawford. Sean and Rebecca were my brother and sister. - My family are already leaving from Riyadh. - Listen, I'm sure that we can work something out. - You're not working anything out! Not for me. You'll be hearing from my attorneys. - Now, I've got a lot of questions for you and your partner. - I understand. - Could you come down to the station? - Yeah, of course. - We'll be in touch. - Thanks. (Sighing) - I am so very sorry about your brother and sister. - Thank you. (Honking) - Sorry. Yeah, it's not any of these people. - I'm not that surprised. The real Sean and Rebecca Crawford lived in Portland, Oregon. - So what about the apartment in Chicago and a house in LA? - All part of the scam. But they knew a lot about the Crawfords, so it's quite possible that they weren't from Chicago at all but came here from Portland. - OK, wouldn't Sean, or whatever his name was, wouldn't his fingerprints be at the house? Or both of theirs at our office, or... - We're working on it. Meanwhile, I'll have one of our computer sketch artists contact you to get composites. Just let us know if you're gonna leave town for any reason and if you do, how to contact you. - OK. - Ms. Baker, I'm not a realtor, but from what you've told me, it seems that you're not at fault here. - So then why does it feel like I am? (Sighing) (Sighing) - So, uh, the bank called. Mr. Ahmad's lawyers have already been in touch and they've frozen our account. - God! - I spoke to our malpractice carriers and our exposure is way beyond our policy limits. - So we're screwed. - Big time. - I'm so sorry, Maddy. - Don't you ever. - Ms. Reynolds? - I'll call you later. - Mm-hmm. - Right this way. (Scoffing) (Clears throat) - What are you doing? - Look, I think we've both known for a long time that-- - You're leaving? - This isn't working. - No, no, it was working two days ago when I had a huge commission cheque that just evaporated. - This used to be fun, but people change. I've changed. - Oh my god! There is someone else. - That's not what this is about, but yeah, there's someone else, someone who believes in me. someone who believes in my work, someone who can actually-- - Get out! Get the hell out! - Fine! No problem! You know, instead of judging others, you should take a look at yourself, babe. Maybe there's a reason you got scammed. (Growling) - Go! God! (Crying) (Sobbing) (Phone ringing) (Ringing) (Grumbling) (Phone beeps) - Yeah? - (Maddy): Hey, it's me. Let me in. - Hmm. - Now. (Phone beeps, buzzing) (Scoffing) - God! (Knocking) - Hey, I brought you some breakfast. - Nice. (Door closing) - Secretarial work, but it's work. And living with my mom is tolerable. Thank you so much for asking. - Why was I with him for 6 months? - Because he's insanely hot. (Inhaling sharply) (French accent): I'm sexy and I'm French, babe. Take care of me and you can thank me later. - Was I really that clueless? - No, but your hormones were. (Chuckles) - Mmm! Yes, there's a laugh. That's a start in the right direction. And I got something else for you. The company that I'm working for is in desperate need of a website redesign. I recommended you for it. - No, I don't think that's a good idea. - What, were you doing something better? - Well, I'm meeting with this bankruptcy lawyer. - What? - I know, that's-- that's pathetic. - You are the poster girl for "woe is me". - I'm gonna pull myself together. - Yeah, I know a really great place for you to start. - Yeah? - Yeah. Look, I gotta get to work. So, um... (Sighing) ...call me this afternoon and I will hook you up with the office manager and the two of you will talk website redesign. - OK. Thank you. - We're gonna get through this, Lauren. (Southern accent): Like Scarlet O'Hara, we shall not go hungry again. (Chuckles) - I don't deserve you. - Don't I know it! (Sighing) (Cell phone ringing) - Ciao,bella. (Cell phone beeps) - Hello? Yeah, Mr. Crawford. Uh-huh. Yeah, I can do that. OK, I'll be right over. Yeah, these, uh, these match up perfectly. This is the same inventory that he gave us. - Thanks. While we're dealing this mess with Mr. Khashan, I just wanted to make sure that nothing was taken. - You know, why don't you tell me about the real Sean and Rebecca. - They lived in Portland. Um, I guess you already knew that. - Hmm. - They inherited our parents' estate. Which was a lot of money, so you know, they enjoyed life, had a lot of friends. They usually make time once a year to travel together. Usually it was a hike. - Wait, you said that, uh, they inherited the estate? And you didn't? No, not a dime. I mean, that's why my name isn't on the deed of the house. - Well, why not? - Well, I was the eldest, the first-born son. And my father expected a lot of me. Um, I was stubborn, competitive. I had a hair-trigger temper, just like him. And for years, I made letting him down my reason for living. I dropped out of high school. I, uh, I did a lot of drugs and I committed some pretty stupid, petty crimes. In return for that, he wrote me off and out of his will. - Wow! - You know, when I finally copped to the fact that I was actually a lot like him, I started to turn my life around. I, uh, I stopped using. - Good. - I've been 10 years clean, which... I got my high school equivalency certificate. - Oh! - And I even joined the army, which, you know, that was the best decision I ever made. - Hmm! - I found my focus and I found these. - What, you found your hands? - Uh, I'm good at, you know, building things, uh, solid, practical things: cabinets, tables, houses. - Oh, so you're a carpenter. - Baltimore's finest. - Huh! - At least that's what it says on my on my business card. Yeah, I, uh, I left all this behind, and I couldn't have been happier. - And now... it's all mine. - How? - I'm next of kin. My dad was thwarted. I've inherited it all. And I wish I hadn't. - (Woman): Identities and whereabouts remain unknown, but an inside source has informed us that the FBI is concentrating its search not only in Chicago but in the victims' home town of Portland, Oregon. (Gulls squawking) - Hi, I'm here to pick up my order. (Cell beeping) (Buzzing) - Hey! It's me. I'm having lunch and you'll never believe who's here! Rebecca! - (Man): Number 144, ready for pick up. - Call me as soon as you get this. (Tires squealing) (Honking) (Cell phone ringing) - Brenna. - Keenan? - What's up? - One of the realtors saw me. Maddy. She followed me in her car and I lost her, but a car rammed into her. - Jesus! Was she hurt? - I don't know. - Did she get close enough to ID your license plate? - Maybe. I don't know. What do I do? - Where are you now? - I'm at home. - Get out of there as soon as we hang up. Leave your car, and don't look back. Check into a motel. Call me once you're settled. - OK, OK. - Then what? - One step at a time, Brenna. Just get yourself safe, then we'll talk. - OK, OK. OK. (♪ Cell phone ringing ) - Keenan. - We have a problem. - I'll be here until the estate settles or at least is out of litigation. Could be awhile. Mr. Khashan has some pretty aggressive attorneys. - Yeah, tell me about it. - Listen, thanks for-- It's just good to talk to someone. - Yeah. - Uh, I'll be here, taking care of the place for awhile. Our... Our caretaker man who was taking care of this place for years killed himself. - Oh! That's terrible. - Yeah. Yeah. Used to play with his son Jimmy when we were kids. - I'm sorry. - Well, at least it gives me something to do. This is a big, old place and it needs a lot of work. - Yeah. (Buzzing) Oh, excuse me. (Grunting) (Cell phone beeps) Hello? Yeah, this is Lauren Baker. Oh! - She's unconscious. She's banged up pretty bad. She's got a broken rib and a broken leg. - What happened? - She ran a red light. - Is she gonna be OK? - Oh, they won't know until she wakes up. I mean, that is if-- if she wakes up. - (Woman on PA): Dr. Peters... - Well, if there's anything I can do... -Hey, it's me. - Aw! - I'm having lunch and you'll never believe who's here. Rebecca! - Number 144, ready for pick-up. - Call me as soon as you get this. (Cell phone beeps) - Number 144, ready for pick-up. - Call me as soon as you get this. (Cell phone beeps) (Telephone beeping) - Hi, uh, Detective Halverson please. -Hey, it's me. I'm having lunch and you'll never believe who's here. Rebecca! - Number 144, ready for pick-up. - Call me as soon as you get this. - She left that message just a few minutes before the accident. She saw Rebecca Crawford or whoever it was that was impersonating her and she ran a red light because she was chasing her. - Does she know another Rebecca? - No, not that I know of. OK. listen to the background on this. I think I know where she was. - I'm having lunch and you'll never believe who's here. Rebecca! - Number 144, ready for pick-up. - Hmm? There is a restaurant just a few blocks away from where the accident happened, Maddy goes there all the time. She saw Rebecca and she followed her. I just know it. - OK. She's not in Portland. She's still in Chicago. Maybe all 3 of them are. (Car honking) - The police are gonna check out the restaurant, but I can't just sit here. I need to catch these animals. - Yeah, but these pictures have already been used in the paper and in the news. - But that was the last news cycle. - I gotta get these out to the people. All right. "The 3 people depicted in these composite drawings "are being sought by authorities in Chicago "in connection with serious, violent crimes. "If you know them or their whereabouts, please call "773-555-0126." Now, we just need to upload them to the web. - What are we gonna call it? - "Britney Spears Topless". - Seriously? - Oh, trust me. This will get hits. Plenty of them. It's called Winters. - And where's that? - Exactly, which is why I couldn't get away fast enough. - So, why Chicago? - Oh, you know, I thought it was a place that my family would never visit. - Oh, that's a good one for the tourism bureau. - Yeah, it's too cold, too far away. - And have they stayed away? (♪ Jazz ) - Thank god, yes. - Ah. Another child of dysfunction, eh? - I think that you would agree with me that every family has some level of dysfunction or misery. - Hmm... - I mean, your caretaker for instance, he must have been miserable. - You know, he was happy when we were kids but I hadn't seen him in years. - Do you think it was... I don't know, uh... coincidental that he killed himself right when all this stuff was happening? - I--I guess so. - You said he had a son. - Jimmy. - Do you know how to reach him? - No. But I could find out. (Siren in distance) (Cell phone beeping) - Keenan. - Hey. Just landed. Driving in from O'Hare. - I've been here all day. No sign of the police. -Then maybe they didn't get her plate number. Give it till morning and then search her place. We don't want anything in there that links her to us. - Got it. (Cell phone ringing) - Hello? Hello? - Oh! Uh, hello. Yeah, um, hi. Yeah, I--I--I-- I saw your--your video on the, um, on the web, um, and I know one of those people. Uh, her--her hair is different but it's definitely her. - Jimmy! - Hey! Wow! It's been a long time. - (Both): I'm sorry-- (Sighing) - It's good to see you, man. - Her name is Brenna. Brenna Lakeview. Uh, she comes in here a lot. We've, uh, kind of become friends. - So then she lives nearby? - Yeah. (♪ Dramatic film soundtrack on TV ♪) Your video said she did something... violent? - Well, um, yeah. She may have. - 'Cause I don't know her that well, you know, but, uh, she seems like a pretty sweet person. You know, just a little... messed up. - Messed up how? - Well, you know, she's an actress, or wants to be. It's a hard life. I guess that's why she comes in here and rents so many DVDs. You know, she wishes she was in them. I don't know. - So do you have her address? I'm really just trying to help. (Sighing) - He didn't seem depressed to me. And he didn't leave a note or anything. But I guess you never really know what's goes on inside somebody. I mean, even your old man. But the police said it was a suicide, so... They see a lot of them. Like you, I, uh, inherited the place. I'm gonna keep it like it is until I can sell it. That's what he used to, um, to tie to the tailpipe. - Do you have a pool? - No. - This is cut from a larger piece. Do you really think your father killed himself? - Well, that's what the police said. - Yeah, but what does your gut tell you? - No. I would have sensed it. I would have noticed something. - So he could've been murdered. - Yeah, but why? - It think it might have something to do with Sean and Rebecca's death. He may have seen something at the house that he wasn't supposed to. - So what do we do now? - First, I'll find out where this came from. I've got a pretty good idea where to start. I'm, uh... (Grunting) I'm gonna take this with me. - You're gonna take it? - Yeah. And if my hunch is right, then I'll show it to the police. - You OK with that? - Sure. (Both talking, indistinct) - Brenna? Brenna? (Cell phone ringing) - Yeah? - (Nelson): I was finishing up at Brenna's place when I was interrupted. I had to bail. - The cops? - No, Brenna's new friend, Lauren Baker. - Get out of there. I'll take care of it. - You got it. (Knocking) - Who is it? - It's me. Hey, baby. - Oh god, Keenan! I'm so glad you're here. - Everything's gonna be OK. - Where we going? - Someplace safer than a motel. - Why don't you just tell them that you didn't kill those people? That you were just, you know, taking advantage of a situation because they were gone and the house was empty. - Because we stole a lot of money, Brenna. And we could go to prison for a very long time. - I will give the money back. I mean, it was just a job. I was just acting. - I know, and you were great. You really pulled it off. - What are we gonna do? I mean, I can't hide forever. - It's OK. I'll take care of you. You're safe with me. OK? - Why the hell did you barge in here like that? - I know, I know. I shouldn't have. But I was-- I was so close to breaking open that-- (Groaning) I wasn't thinking straight. - No, you weren't. And "Britney Spears Topless"? (Chuckling) - No one can resist a peek. - I'll remember that. You were right about Ms. Reynolds, by the way. The fast food restaurant? Yeah, we've got the woman on video. She changed her appearance a little bit, but we're pretty sure it's the same woman. (Sighing) And now, it looks like we know where she lives. - We found this. And a bank statement. She deposited almost $50,000 a month and a half ago. - 50 grand? - That means the other two walked away with almost $10 million. - Generous guys. - This was also with the statement. - Let me see. Here. Mean anything to you? Keenan Blake. - Oh my god! That's Sean's phone number. Keenan Blake is Sean Crawford. - Here? - Yeah, there's a little apartment in the back with a shower, toilet, hot plate. Nelson used to work here. - How long do I have to stay here? - Not long. Just enough time for me to take care of a few things. There used to be hundreds of people who worked here. Then one day they say they're shutting down. No warning. Recession wiped them out. Blood-sucking banks. Now the only ones left are the rats. - I don't think I can stay here. - I'm just kidding, babe. You're gonna love it. - It gives me the creeps. - You'll see. It's gonna be fine. Check it out. - What are you doing? - No. What are you doing? - What? - You and Lauren. - What are you talking about? - Why did you lure me back to Chicago? - I didn't. What is this? Blackmail? A set-up? - Why would you think that? Why would I do that to you? (Gasps) - Don't lie to me! Nelson saw her at your apartment. (Switchblade clicking) (Groaning) - Uh, Ms. Baker, leave the detective work to us, all right? We're pretty good at it. - OK. - And keep icing that. (Chuckles) (Phone dialling) -Hello. - Hi, Garrett? - Hi. - Yeah, it's me. (Sighing) I've got a lot to tell you. - Me too. - I'm coming by. -See you soon. (Phone beeps) (Car honking) - Garrett? Garrett? Garrett? Hmm! (Chuckling) - Lauren? Lauren? Hello? Lauren? Lauren? Lauren? (Clattering) Lauren! Wait! What's wrong? (Groaning) (Tires squealing) (Ringing) - Det. Halverson. - Garrett Crawford is in on it! He and Keenan Blake are friends and now he knows I know that. - Where is he now? - Ah! He's at the mansion. He tried to stop me, but I got away. I pepper-sprayed him. - OK, where are you? - Uh, I'm on my way home. - OK, listen, when you get there, lock your windows and your doors. - OK. (Sirens) - You guys check out front. Let me know if you find anything. I'm going to Lauren Baker's place. - Hi, Lauren. (Panting) It's nice to see you again. Experience. Diligence. Integrity. You just couldn't leave it alone, could you? - I called the cops. They're already on their way. - Oh well, I guess that means we'll just have to hurry things up then. It's too bad you didn't call them in time to save Brenna. - Ah! Aaah! (Panting) What did you do to her? - You'll see. (Grunting) - Oh! My-- (Tires squealing) - Are you OK? - Yeah. - OK, come on. (Both grunting) (Siren in distance) - So how long has it been? - I don't know, 8 years. - OK. Well, listen, I'm gonna have a lot more questions for you in the morning. In the meantime, try to get some sleep, all right? - (Man 1): Ah, yes, sir. This is 1-3-2. - (Woman): Easy going. - (Man 2): Any other the witnesses? - Hey. Kennan's on his way to the hospital. - (Man 3): Over there. Her and her husband. - So you knew him? - Yeah. Yeah. From when I was stationed in Fort Bragg. He was a bartender at our local hangout. - But you--you looked through all those composites and you didn't recognize him? - Yeah, well, you saw the photo. I mean, he looked completely different then. He weighed a lot more. If he hadn't have signed it, would you have recognized him? - No, I guess-- I guess not. - I spent a lot of down time at that bar. He was a good listener, and I just-- I talked. I... I told him about my life. I told him about my family. He knew so much about Sean and Rebecca because he'd heard it from me. I just never made the connection. You know what I mean? What did some bartender halfway across the country have to do with any of this? - But you came after me with a knife! (Scoffing) - I thought your life was in danger. I grabbed the knife to protect you. - Oh. Oh, right. Yeah. - And what about you? I mean you were pretty quick to think I was involved with Keenan. You had to run for your life? - OK, well I had a lot of people lie to me. A lot. I mean, I--I wouldn't have even met you if people hadn't deceived me, so... I've got trust issues. (Chuckles) - We're children of dysfunction. - Ooh! And I'm sorry about that pepper spray. (Chuckling) And the Murano. - Yeah, well, I guess under the circumstances, I guess I, uh, I got off easy. (Cell phone ringing) (Cell phone beeps) - Hello. - Damn, girl. I missed out on all the fun. - What are you talking about? You were in a car chase! - Yeah. There's that. I would have caught her, too, if it wasn't for that damn red light. (Chuckling) (Woman talking, indistinct) - It's so good to have you back. - It's good to be back. - OK, I'll see you in the morning. - Hmm... - (Woman on PA): Dr. Peters... - Well, she's gonna be in there for awhile, but she's out of the worst of it. - OK. You hungry? - Oh! I am starving. - I have steaks at my house. - Are you cooking? - Absolutely. - Oh! (Chuckling) (Sighing) Thank you. Thank you for not being one of the bad guys. - Any time. By the way... I'm gonna be selling my house pretty soon. And, uh, I wonder if you know any decent realtors? - I might. - I just might. Closed captions: Vision Globale
