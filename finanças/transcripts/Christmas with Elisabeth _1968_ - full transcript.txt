And now, body gymnastics... It won't stop raining. Let's go. How long will it be raining, Hubert? It will stop. And it will start snowing. - Twice, today. - You're gonna to spend a lot? - I've heard how your amateurs failed yesterday. - So what? - We don't have proper wings. - You don't have legs. - Good morning, Hubert. - Hello. - Don't you have a birthday these days? - Are you nuts? It's said you were good in whist yesterday. You forgot to wash yourself at home. Bastard. Bloody girder. - Good day. - Hello Hubert. When will this trash go into repair? - I was stuck at Diakovice yesterday. - Hubert, this is comradess Tomajdisova. - Alzbeta. - Nice to meet you. Adam. - How's in Prague? Expensive? You have co-driver finally. Co-driver-ess. I hope you'll be good... why wouldn't you be? You don't speak too much and comradess has a lot to think. Don't let her drag weighty things. - How weighty? - I can drag everything. Beer crates... sacks... and so on. You know yourself, you've got your own reason. - So miss isn't a co-driver but a tourist. - What can you drag, so can I. Don't be affraid. I am. Take the clique and start the engine. Excuse me, madam. Thanks. She was in a creche, penitentiary... We've been instructed for her to be under good leading. Why doesn't take her Kabela? Kabela speaks like a priest at meetings. Why me? Why not him? Are you nuts? Look at her. Can we put her to a married man? You know how their hen looks like. One plus one make two. We've been thinking with the director who can educate... Thanks for the trust. But I think the lady won't like it with me. The gate. I won't pay the insurance for anyone. - Could you bring me a basket of apples from Eva? - Yes. One is done. - Can you sell me one Partisan? - I'll stop at Bezdikov's Tobacco for you. - Is everything alright, mr. Hubert? - Everything... Only the miss will pay you when she's paid, two sausages and a bun. Planetarium. Pity it isn't sunny, it looks great when it's sunny. How much I'll earn here? Nine hundreds. I put my crate in nice craziness. Is it called a crate now? Don't be late! Window. - Get on the cove. - It doesn't matter. Bring a towel tomorrow, and put it in the pack on your side. Don't care about me. When you ride with me, you'll wash yourself. Good I have a co-driver. Driver prepares, co-driver carries. Do you want to hurt yourself? Driver prepares, co-driver carries. You're supposed to be on the truck, hell. Don't do any gimmickry here. Don't yell at me, I'm adult, in case you don't know. I know, they told me. Why are we standing here? Because of my nerves. Your nerves are bad? They will be much worse soon enough. Three. They're four. Each time there comes four. The fourth. All monkeys are together now. Maybe the grass won't disappear under the snow this year. I am authrotic sometimes too. What? I go mad. - How come your school is over? - Our teacher is sick. Sick teacher is best teacher. - I couldn't solve it, uncle. - How come you couldn't? You want to be an engineer? - You're eyes are bad. - Once more. - There's only one preachment. - Show me. Just like that, look. It's completely primitive. - Do you see? - Thank you. Clean your boots next time, or else you'll go by foot. Don't close it. Clean it. I have lunch here. You can have it too. I'm not hungry. I'll be here in a moment. Hey. Do you know what time is it? My watch stopped. It'll be one o'clock in five minutes. Pity we don't have japanese time. What? Ah, I see. - Who was it? - Who? The guy. I don't know everyone. Do you want a Camel? No. - There's a cinema at Nyrany. - Where are Nyrany? There are Rapotice here, then Kupsany, then Nyrany. At the barrier. I see. What a joy, I bow in front of you. "Don't put crates here!" - Don't you see there's something written here? - I see, but I'm too lazy about reading. Lots of health and many years, mr. Hubert. You should have bought candies for yourself instead of that. Eva put here a basket of apples for her mum. Thanks, good bye. Have a fun for once. Off you go, before I'll break your dragon. - You're free to go. - Easy, easy. - So long. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. The broom belongs to the holder where you found it. Put everything back to its place. You're to touchy to move. Do you want me to make laces on the barrow for you? You can turn off water. There's a shower there. I'll lend you a soap, go to... - I'll change the oil. - I've got a pock at home. Do you have an alarm too? Tomorrow it's a saturday delivery. Don't be affraid, don't be affraid. I'm not affraid. I'm scared. Are you sleeping? What's up? I remembered I've got a birthday today after all. I completely forgot. I don't remember my parents as well. Will you smoke? Isn't it your name day too? Franta... Don't you know where did they put the girl? The one who rides with me. - Tomajdysova? - Yes, Tomajdysova. Aston, come here. They gave her the room which had belonged to Bodlak. No. - Yes. - Schubert should have gotten it. They gave it to Tomajdeska. Director Nykl did. What would Nykl need from her? I don't know what he would need. A sewer, Sodoma and Gomora. Good night grandpa, come to drink sometimes. Hubert, think! Pepa announces red hundred, we've got two tens, red ace is gone, I'm coming with a ten, and you're announcing twenty like a fool. Now it's all theirs, and we won't get Karlstejn. Eda, bring me a beer, or I'll get a heartstroke. What was the name of the city... A volcano exploded there... No one did make it... What was the name... What was the name of the volcano, I knew it. - Popocatepetel is a volcano. - Sure. - It is. I'm pawned again. You'd lose your nerves in Monte Carlo. Eda, don't you remember the city, where they all died? Because of the volcano. They all had a lunch on a table, and suddenly... They were spoken to be punished by God for the orgies. Orgies? Because of a volcano? Bring me a beer. Was it supposed to be here? No, in Italy. Ah, in Italy... - It begins with P. - Postoloprty! Bring us a bottle of Gamza. What are we drinking for? Eda, have a one too. What for, Hubert? Pompeii it was. Good evening, mr. Hubert. Which one is her? You wouldn't understand. Won't there be the Flood? I hope there will be. At night feast, in the morning... Were you lucky in the game? You can bite my ass. Don't you have a reserve co-driver? Can't you wait a moment? I'll be waiting till miss will dig up herself from under the sheet. Don't be mad. I'm not. Do you know how long was she in the pub? As soon as I went off she just started. Are you a dispatcher or a nanny? I'll ride for her on the bike. Send a taxi every morning for her. You could give the room to Schubert, she doesn't need her own bed at all. You're going to scare the country in these half-clothes? Is it forbidden to dress well for work? Tell her something, comrade! Miss, as soon as you're back, meet me in the office. You've got the advance payment there. If I get a stroke, don't go to my funeral, fat head. You had to lose a lot of money, you borrowed three times. Don't you want get some fresh air? Not really, I'm cold. No wonder you're cold. After so much work. Good night. Cover up your ads, - We're not at a brothel here. - Do you mind? Take your hands off pockets, and go somewhere else. You'll wait here for a bus, it's here in half an hour. Go home or wherever you want, I'll take the trip on my own. - I can't do it to you. - Do it to me. We can call each other with first name, if you want. I promised myself I won't avoid a single shift. I've got to write a letter to a former employer. I don't want to ruin her christmas. Don't put your hands into the food. We don't put our hands into food. Go backwards and climb up on the body. - Why? - I don't have time. We don't have time. The planetarium is all wet today. Who wouldn't sleep. Everybody would. Why didn't you wake me up? I'd help. To the grave. You don't have to be so anxious I wouldn't learn working in all my life. Wouldn't you work somewhere else? Maybe in an office, nobody works there. Or in a warehouse. It might be fun. It wouldn't be fun, I'm very lazy reader. I can count to ten. I like it here. How long can you stand one job? Three or four months. Why? Do you know we had a roe in the creche too? Its name was Ruza named after one crazy girl. We watched TV and she cut his veins. With such a little scissors you're cutting the cigarette. Before we'd came she was gone. In the morning the roe came. And girls told it was Ruza. - It's a nonsense, isn't it? - What? That a man can reincarnate to a roe. Ruza was a fool for what she did anyway. We agreed we won't make any problems since then. But the roe ran away anyway. Through a wired fence. She scratched her back, there was blood. We went to the forest with medkit, but we weren't able to find her. Do you think she died? Maybe not. A roe finds moss and stops blood with it. The director said so too. But how can she finds moss? - She knows where is such moss. - Even in the dark? In the dark as in the light. Here, daddy, smoke! Bloody brat. You'll be beaten you won't recognize yourself. What have I done? What? Such a piece. Don't yell, grandpa, don't yell. - What have I done anyway? - What... Don't get my uniform dirty. Who will wash it? Take the shroud under flowers. - Where are you going? - To the hell. Put some shoes on, it isn't July. Do you hear me? Alzbeta, come here, I won't hurt you. Come here, Alzbeta. Do you hear? Show me your hands. Asshole. A can fell out. What if I would break your neck by accident? Don't bother. I'll do it myself soon probably. - Is it your daughter? - We're quite similar, aren't we? Well... - 12.20,- - How much? - 12.20,- Since you don't have proper skirt, don't stretch the sticks at least. Or they won't end up harvesting beet here. - Where it happened with the roe? - At Kolovraty. - I'm thinking about it too. You too? - Hm? How come it has such a high flame? - There's gas inside. - Show me. I once had a pet roe too. Put it on, brat. At Ratmanice we'll load full pot of crates. There's the highest consumption of mineral water. They've got crap in water-conduit. They boil a soup from mineral water. Get a coat, so that you won't beg in the evening. Don't be affraid. I'm not affraid, but I'm scared. Hell, you've got a towel there. Pardon. Everything's rotten. When it'll go to pieces, they'll wonder. - How much did you get? - He said I'm supposed to come later. - Later when? - Later. When we're done. Why? Hi Hubert. Am I not interrupting? - Something new with the car? - No. Not really. - I'll take the money for her. - Are you crazy? She has to sign it. - Where? - Here. What line? 350. One moment. Good. I'm not buying lobsters. The crone has only one week old ones. - How much costs one? - 1.70,- - It did cost 1.50,- What do you think? You sneak in, look at me, Did I kill my parents? Or am I fifteen? Or what? Look at that. We haven't distributed this. - Shall we distribute this on christmas? - I beg you... No, I beg you. You and Nykl. For a courtesy. Either I'm supposed to educate her, and then nobody will interfere, or take the stretch-legs to the HQ and you can educate her there in evenings. Clear? Am I forbidden to have a word with a woman? A good word has positive influence for social cases... Don't talk to her fatty, you're talking too fast. You undress immediately. Positive influence... In boxers... Hubert, do you have newspapers? Hell, I forgot, grandpa. Any troubles, Hubert? Everything alright, there was nothing in them today. The war hasn't broken out yet. Too much for doing nothing. She got away without money for lunch. She doesn't mind. The main thing is fun. After that. - What cigarettes are these? - Indian. - How much? - Seven bucks. Give me them. - I'll try them. - It won't be anything special. At least I haven't heard anything great about them. 7 korunas for cigarettes, 70 halirs for newspapers, that makes... Give me two korunas. Long time no rain. - Hello. - Hello. I'm bringing a salary for the young girl working at our place. So long. - Who are you looking for? - I'm bringing a salary for the girl. Hello mr. Hubert. Are you going on wedding? You forgot your money yesterday. I thought... I passed along... - It's 350 korunas. - Come inside. - I don't want to bother you. - Come, the police woman across the hall spies on me. Do you know the hag? Don't you know where the bench was standing? - It makes 350 korunas. - Thanks. Sit down. - Do you have a cigarette? - Yes. - Count the money. - Yes, yes. You bought festal ones. Fatty won't bother you anymore. I told him so. - I think he won't. - You're worried about me. That's alright. Alzbeta, sit down here for a moment. Give me a hand. I haven't known you're such a fun. Don't you want a coffee? - Look into my eyes. - Yeah, and you'll burn me with a cigarette. I've been thinking I should... have a serious conversation about life. I see. So I'll put cloth on the table, comrade. Let's start. Is that the domesticated one? - Whose hands are there? - Someone was standing there. - You were married? - I guess so. - Have you ever had a dog? - I've always had a dog. You had to enjoyed it very much. I would like a puppy. - Where would you have it? - In bed. The cigarettes are rubbish for seven korunas. We had a puppy once at creche. Nobody knew it. The director maybe did. It appeared on the yard and nobody knew from where. A bitch dropped it from a window later. - Have some. - Thanks. You're from ROH anyway. You should have found someone for the life. Everyone would marry you gladly. Nobody would, you're only guessing. One wouldn't marry me. I'll take a few cigarettes, may I? I don't have any. You're just like our director. She always spoke to us like to normal people. She was always telling us things like you do. Things for life. We told ourselves we'll behave. But then something new appeared. I don't know why. Wouldn't you tell me why? I wish you would. What's up? What's with you? Nothing. We're speaking. It's raining again? I'll borrow newspapers for a moment, yes? I'm a bitch. If there is a bitch... I'm a bitch. - Hubert, do you have newspapers? - Yes, on the closet. - Isn't something burning here? - I smell it too, for a while. Where's your young one? Where have you left the chick? How come you're not ready yet? Collections yet. Collections again? There will be mad house again. 90 korunas... I'd screw it. - Couldn't you wait a moment? - For whom? Don't you know for whom? Policemen are looking for you. There's a missing bench in the park. Could you raise your hands once in a year? You thought I wouldn't come, right? I didn't catch my link at Prague. I went to Benesov as hitchhiker. I caught it there. - Big deal. - It's Pepa. Where do you want to go in the fancy-dress? Distribute. It's a work day, isn't it? - What did I say last time? - What did you say last time? Didn't I say how you should dress up for work? What? Normal clothes... Go out and sweep the window. Give me the rag, I'll give you another one. Stop, stop, open up! - Get lost! - Stop! Hubert, you weren't young once? I lied you, I went to Benesov by taxi, I paid 150. To catch a local train, to get you at the gate. Do you carry sick ones or whores? Have you seen anyone going to work in fancy-dress? Pardon, but you won't call me a whore! Don't think you can say anything you want. I can. Have you heard what did he say? You're a witness. I'm in a hurry. I'm carrying an acute appendix. - Mrs., you've heard it. - Miss, I've got my own problems. Do you know what you are? Grandpa. As soon as I get you, I'll break your neck. It's on your conscience. Wasn't there a girl in a white jacket and white tights here? No. Unless I wouldn't notice. You surely would. Where did you find the bear? I'm looking for something similar. In Prague. Where did you poke out the eye? Was there someone carrying a girl in a white jacket and white tights in a car or on a motorcycle? I had lunch in a pub and breakfast before that. Karel, put a front-glass there. How did you manage? I caught a limb. Shit, I left them somewhere again. I guess in the car. - Hubert, will you come? - I will. Thanks, Karel. The rain won't stop this year. You've come. Hell, you know I've forgotten only the death. My head was in pain. Look... If you don't mind, you can give it to the doxy. Suit yourself, the same for Nykl. - Why me? - I don't have time. I'd like to deliver the dead before they stop to move. What has happened yesterday between you two? Frankly, what happened yesterday? You mean the girl? She broke mr. Hubert's window with a stone. I sent her off to hell, I am allowed to do that, right? The work is not a pigeonry. But she's in parole. She'll go to jail for parasitism. For two years, fool. We guaranteed for her at the prosecution. As soon as you're back we'll write it down. - You're to meet the director due to some writing. - Alright. - Do you hear? - Yeah, I'm not deaf. What am I supposed to tell him? He's waiting. Tell him I'm sending my regards. Hubert, newspapers. C'mon, all you do is reading newspapers. Karel, would you lend me your car for tonight? I've got to go somewhere. I'll pay, of course. Won't there be ice? My tires are shabby. Where'd it come from? It's warm, mushrooms are growing. Button is gone, again. Scrap. - Silence, shut up. - Kazan, come here. - I'd like to speak with your director. - You have someone here? I hope. Actually, yes. Are you looking for me? - I'm waiting for mrs. director. - That's me, Postolkova. Hubert Smiral. What can we do for you? I've come... I'm looking for... Sure, it's about one of our girls. Name? Alzbeta Tomajdesova. What has she done this time? Something to you? No, I mean... She suddenly disappeared. - I wish you understood... - I understand perfectly, go on. I figured out she could have come here. - Hasn't she? - No, she hasn't arrived to us. She simply took her suitcase and left. That's her method. Didn't she take your suitcase too? Why me? Oh, sorry, I thought I'm dealing with a stricken one. Marticka, show yourself, I can see you. Good day. Marticka, get me Blaza to my office. Couldn't she return without you knowing it? Have you seen our fence? A roe got out. Did she tell you? Alzbeta remembered it, let's see. She spoke mainly about you. We didn't like each other too much. She said she had to write you a letter. - She told me about the puppy too. - Really? She dropped it off the window. She was grounded for a month. Alzbeta is a little bit of neurotic. She was raped at 14, you surely know that. No, I don't know. Yes. In most cases girls start to feel bad about... Can I speak frankly to you? Of course. Girls get aversion to the act. Alzbeta on the contrary. She herself initiated it at one trip. Assault of a teacher. He was about 50. You haven't noticed anything about your person? No. Strange. May I ask... are you married? No, I was. I'm sorry about my directness, it's professional interest... Do you meet women? - No. - I see. Listen, Blazenka. Isn't Alzbeta back? No. Hasn't she come to visit you? No. Listen, Blazenka. Go and look if she hasn't come after all. Yes? Tell her to come here. I believe you, Blazenka. Let's see, Alzbeta. Good evening. Wait a moment, girl. I'm leaving for a moment, so that you can speak. I have nothing to say. I didn't want to break the bloody window. My hand slipped. Window? What window? One window, a small window. - What are you talking to her, morron? - Nobody is morron. What's got to your head? Don't you know they can put you to a courthouse? Do you want to a jail for two years? Don't grin or it'll stuck with you. Why do you worry about me, am I about you? Why are you interested in a whore. You're here to bring me back to the bed, right? I didn't slap him, he slapped me. Yes, I did slap her. I see. Slapping of wards isn't permitted. Don't play dumb. Take your stuff and let's go. It'll be misty. I wouldn't like going back through milk. I'm not going anywhere. As you wish. You're old enough to choose. You'll may be better in jail. Why not. What if yes? What do you know? As soon as you're in Plzen, send greetings to old gardener Juza. - You know Juza? - Probably, since I'm telling you this. Tell it to my hand. You were in jail? I haven't come to talk about myself. For what they could put you in a cage. Where's your suitcase? In your room? Where? I'm not going anyway. I slightly broke a neck of such rascal. So be careful. - I see? - What do you see? What? - I mean it's clear to me. - Nothing's clear to you. Wasn't it your wife accidently? Weren't you a stag to the roe? Help! Hell of a rain. There hasn't been christmas like this before. It's tomorrow now. Sleep, you've got one more hour. What about the tree? You wouldn't guess. I see you're thinking I'm very dull. Go take a piss, we'll avoid an extra stop. - Hello Hubert. - Hello Karel. - How the car worked? - Well enough. What was the deal? The family. It's a state feast today? - Will you ever come to play? - Sometimes maybe. Good day, mr. Hubert, are you going to a photographer today? Give me the bear. And the umbrella. - Good day. - Good day. Make it two. Did you know Vosta? The blind boy? Is he still in the toilet cleaning party? Yes. How long have you been there? Long enough to try to avoid it next time. Romeo's calling you. So be it. - Were you there because of her? - Do I ask about your stuff? Go on. Rather not. - Will you come? - What? - I say if you come. - What? Look how you handle them. - So you haven't got rid of the bitch. - Well... - How much are the candles? - 2.70,- - And the crackers? - 1 koruna. So get on. I hope you'll come at least for the carol. I'm delivering tomorrow. So that's why. Let's see. Check patrol, testing for alcohol. Hubert, take us to Zabrany, we're doing two burials today. Pardon, I mean two weddings. My pleasure. Pardon. What a luck I didn't give the pants to children for playing. Clean your shoes, did you cross litter? Souvenir. Hell, it's a strong wool. - You want to walk by foot, right? - Pardon, what have I done? I did some faux-pas? Is this girl your daughter? Haven't you seen they look alike? Hubert, could you bring us the uncle Zboril from Hate? We've forgotten abou him and cars are gone. - Am I a taxi? - Hubert, you know us. - We can go hunting together later. - Please, go. Nice to make a business with you. Miss can wait for you here. - Do you want to? - I'll go with you. She's in the sixth month, he has skirts everywhere... I will give them blessings. With a big beating! Let's dance. - Am I stepping on your legs? - No at all. - Only a little, am I? - Oh no, you're dancing great. You're lying like a professional. Wow, daddy. - May I? - Is still raining outside? - Yes. - Come when it's snowing. You're showing your dye. You had to be big lounge lizard earlier. That's all you know? Lullabies? Sport mix. Hubert, don't slip out of the shorts. Watch your fingers. You're missing one bar. Fools, what a fools they are. Enough, you've got enough. Me? No problem. Hubert, don't get a stroke. Enough! I've got enough. Are you crazy? Where is my sweater, hell, get me my sweater. I don't like the young assholes who still talks about themselves boxing. They're showing up, they want for you to touch their muscles or so. Good. Well, there was not much in the demijon. When they're talking, I don't know sometimes about what. I'm not listening to them at all. - Would you believe it? - Yes. You're lying so beautifully that I do. Heda, sing along. How is that? Something must get under our wheel. - Haven't you got dirty? - No. Show me, I'll carry you. - Hang on. - Don't be affraid. Don't be affraid of anything, Alzbeta. I'm not affraid of anything too. I was never affraid of anything and anyone. Even not Nykl, anything and anybody! Silence. The grandpa mustn't hear us, I've lost the damned newspapers again. Imagine, Alzbeta, when I were as young as you, I was boxing. Just touch my muscles, go on. What are you laughing at? Are you laughing at me? - I'm not laughing. - Good for you. You don't have to come tomorrow, I've got only a few things. - Clean up your room... Good evening. - Good evening. It's still raining. I could tell you stories. What is it to trust anyone. Suddenly... The end. She borrowed him even pyjamas. Do you believe it? I got it for christmas from her. I pulled him through a sleeve from the pyjamas. Don't you want to stay here? It's raining outside. - You're not well. - What? Me? I was never better. Alzbeta... You're quite bearable. Such a... Come, I'll make you a coffee, right? Wait, I don't have any coffee. I'll make tea, right? From Sweet Briar. - You'll have headache in the morning? - From what? From this lump? From this bit? When I was in the army, we drank so much. Nobody can imagine that. Come, I've got a bottle of Vermouth somewhere. I'll come tomorrow, I'll come to look at your tree, right? Good night. Don't you want a parasol? She doesn't want to. As though I wouldn't know what she's alike. Not even into the mouth... Ever... Not even a gill... What a pig I am. She had to think nicely about me. - Have you heard the noise at night? - Which one? Someone got drunken and walk home on his four. People are cattle. You're said to start a capella band. You're said to have a bicycle ride with the girl yesterday. You can bite my ass. Hubert, old gun, you let me sleep and had fun yourself. Where is your snake girl? Goody day, mr. Hubert, will there be a winter at all? Won't there be a spring directly? Don't you feel the fresh warm air? Why are you giving it to me, is it mine? That doesn't matter, does it? 1000, from the account. Wait, 500 is enough. One moment. - Merry christmas. - Merry christmas, Hubert. - Grandpa, newspapers. - Don't waste your time, I've subscribed. Yes, I'm coming. Finally. Hello, Hubert. I don't want to interrupt, but a wagon of butter's come to Nyrany. We have to take away the butter. - Who? - Nykl said you can have dinner, it can wait. - Why me? - Look at it, you've got a tree too? Why me? I do wagons every feast. It was the same last year. You're waiting for someone? For whom? Do you know for whom? Who is the second plate for? It's for a case I would break the first. Who will load the wagon for me? Wagon is not fun. Me, like last year. What a labour. Merry christmas, Hubert. Hell, where is my bicycle? I haven't locked it? Hands up! Don't you know where my bicycle is? Haven't you put it somewhere? I've taken your bicycle just now. I'm riding around the tree. I've come on the bicycle. I leaned it against the wall. Wasn't there a bench here? - Yes, there was a bench here. - Which one? - Which one is it? - An indian one. - I see. - You know them? - Yes. - My boy has brought them to me. Stop, stop! Look. Would you say it's possible? If someone would tell me, I'd say it's not possible. The rain has stopped. It's going to snow. I think the bicycle will appear. What? What do you say? Nothing. It's snowing. Subtitles by kostej (2010)
