THE DETECTIVE AND DEATH A piece of candy? Hello, Cornelio. That suit looks good on you. Want some candy? You going to kill me? The Big Shit wants to see you. I'm to take you to the Blue House. I'll go with you. Cornelio? Cornelio! Let's go. Death doesn't give back what it takes. But sometimes it exchanges one life for another. THE DETECTIVE AND DEATH l am forced to leave you... ...to undertake without you... ...the only business for which your collaboration... ...and my experience are of no use. I confess that I do not do it willingly... ...but on medical... ...prescription. I thank Dr. Alblin for his care... ...his patience and his honesty. I wanted to pay him in cash, for once... ...and with no discount. I wouldn't like to find myself in the Great Beyond... ...with unpaid debts to add to my other sins. I'm going to face the only government I can't fool... ...or corrupt. I have thought of a reflection, as a way of saying good-bye. We are all dead for many years before we are born. And we remember nothing. I trust that up above... ...they won't remember anything I did down here. If any of you were to ask me if I am afraid... ...I would have to behave honorably, for once... ...and answer: Yes. But, when they ask me up there... ...whether I regret having known you... ...I shall reply honestly: No. I've had no greater consolation in life than your bad company. And now, when I cross that threshold... ...you will have the consolation of never seeing me again. I would ask that we omit any farewells. May your silence carpet my footsteps... ...and distance ease our parting. Not again! - I like it. - You don't like it. And it makes you ill. You just drink to annoy me. I don't have her eyes, do I? Nor her talent as an actress to hypnotize you. But I'm a poisonous snake, like her. Listen, Laura. Your mother is your mother, you are you. In all of Humanity's history, this has never happened to anyone. What? Being you. Copy it a hundred times. Remember it. "I am the only person who is me." "I am the only person who is me." And the others? They are them. Stay in the center of what surrounds you... ...as if it were you who sees,.. ...and the others who look. Did you tell my mother that? It wasn't necessary. Happy birthday, Laura. If I keep having birthdays, I'll end up being her age. And, to you, I'll be like her. If you keep drinking like her, you will. Forget about her. The child of hate and envy... ...is called meanness. You're right. I'm mean. My father, the duke... ...taught me to hate her when I lived with him. But you taught me to envy her. She'll come back to the Blue House. I know her. She won't come back. I promise you. She knows you're ill. She's waiting. She knows too much, she'll blackmail you. She's done it before. And all that's mine will be hers again. Come with me. You'll see something you'll never forget. Your gift, Laura. I had it made for you. It's us! A time will come when we are all just that. Ghosts! Living reflections which don't need a mirror. Can they see us? I don't know. They're looking at us! They know we're here. - I'm afraid! - You shouldn't be. It's just a trick. But isn't it wonderful? She wants to talk! They do talk. Listen. Laura... It's horrible! Just imagine a world like that. Images that are untouched by time, just by light. A world without pain. Made in our image and likeness. It's all yours, Laura. You're the first to have... -...a toy like this. - I don't want it! - Get me out of here! - Go on. Touch it. - She's there! I felt something. - What was it? I don't know. Cold. One day we'll be able to warm them. They're sensitive to our desires. I want them to disappear! They've gone. But they'll come back when you want. And when I am dead... ...our images will be together there. There... Look! - There's someone else. - Your mother. - Make her go away! - You called her. I don't want to see her or hear her! They only say what you want to hear. You took everything I had, Laura. Go away! Laura... I don't want your gift. I thought you'd like it. It's as extraordinary... ...as the magic carpet from the 1 ,001 Nights. It seemed like a fantasy back then, and now look. We all fly. If you won't accept my gift... ...the basement will stay in darkness. I'll give my work to men and my body to the smoke. I'm going to die, Laura. I just want to give you what you ask me. Whatever you want. The last thing I do for you. I want Mother to die. The Dark Man has gone to find the detective. The detective will take us to the Duchess. Then he will die too. - May I ask a question? - You can try. - Why didn't you go away with her? - I was waiting for you. For me? You all thought she was with me, right? Even when all is in flames, there's a car to the Blue House. What's going on? Look around. There'll be action tonight. They're stirring things. Fucking hell! I forget the password. That's the password. - Very clever. - Sure. It was my idea. Skip it. He's all right. One of these days, the shit's going to hit the fan. Come on. I painted the eyes. So you're the detective. Is it true you sleep with my mother? You could be her son. So you're Laura. Is it true you sleep with BS? You could be his granddaughter. Go in, Cornelio. I'm not here because I was brought or because you called me. I know, I know. It's because you wanted to come. I'm pleased. Sit down. We've both fucked the same woman. And that unites us, even against our will. The Duchess does have a persuasive pussy. Do you know her secret? She doesn't have it in its place. It's up here... ...where it should be. And you're young. It was inevitable, I knew that. Don't think that I mind. I almost like it. I'd foreseen it, I'd imagined it. I even wanted it. You kicked her out so you could sleep... ...with her daughter. And you didn't do your duty. I trusted you and you let her escape! Don't worry, she'll never talk. What did she say about me? She told me you are death. She flatters me. And she told me death is going to die. Death is walking towards his tomb. She's right. I'm very ill. What do you think of me? - May I be honest? - Please do. I think you're a bastard... ...and you're not dead yet. You're wrong. I am a bastard, but I am dead. Before, death just concerned other people. Now it concerns me. You know what it feels like? Laziness. Desire fades away and laziness increases. There are only 2 or 3 things worth moving your ass for. Two or three? That's not bad. Were there more before? There was one which included everything. Ambition. Promiscuous and never satisfied, Cornelio. Like life. It was life! I suppose one of those 2 or 3 things is Laura. And the Duchess. She's always in my mind now. Is there a third? Immortality. For a dead man, you're still ambitious. Immortality! When I was alive, I never thought about it. Now I'd like to invent it, before I die. Salt-free. I have to eat something before I take my pills. I can drink a little too, but you know me. I never liked a little of anything. I want all of everything! Anything wrong, sir? Nothing, DM . Sometimes Laura listens. I must see the Duchess before dawn. Bring her. We know she's in the city, waiting for you. And we know you know where she is. It will be better for everyone. For her, for you... ...for Laura. Today is her birthday and she wants to see her mother. He'll go with you. If I were you... ...I wouldn't be with me. I'll end up getting fond of you. Remember the time you got drunk... ...after your last fight? You had a black eye... ...a broken rib... ...and a woman's ass on each knee. You punched me... ...and I couldn't breathe for 15 minutes. Losing your breath is the worst thing that can happen you. Worse than pain or anything. You told me to go to the Blue House... ...and the Big Shit would give it back to me. Very funny! Back then, you and BS got on well. You were good friends. I was just a dark man. You could make jokes and all, couldn't you? Now things have changed. And I'm still a dark man. If I were you, I'd get rid of me. And how much would you pay to get rid of me? A lot. Ever seen a thousand 10,000 notes together? Not even separated. If I were you, we'd go where I tell you. That's what we're doing. A thousand 10,000s is too much. Don't think I believe it. If you had it, you wouldn't have waited. You're not stupid. You can count it. If you don't want it, leave it. The Duchess gave it to me for letting her escape. You can have it to go on a trip. With you? Alone, and far away. - You'll live like a king. - Until the Big Shit finds me. You're not that important. He's very ill, and the dead lose their memory. No one's going to bother about you. You're doing it for her! Darling! ls the money here? I'll give you a clue. It isn't there. Cold, cold. Is that you? Quite a sight! - That's not how you do it. - How then? Look. With your right fist, you protect your chin. With your elbow, the liver. Your left arm marks the distance. Like that. But your legs are what matter. I don't like boxing. It's dirty work. Why punch someone when you can kill him? Some do it to be someone. And others to forget they were born. Very good, very touching! I've a different philosophy. If the money is here, I still don't know what I'll do. But if it isn't, I'll kill you. Look! There it is. Up there. It's yours. - An idiot wouldn't believe that! - That's why I put it there. You do it. Me? Cornelio! Come down ! I'll find the Duchess and take her to the Blue House! Do you hear? Go... go away! Here, take this. See if that shuts him up. Listen, Cornelio! Don't be so smart. We'll work together. You need me! Shut him up! No! Don't hurt him! Then shut him up! I... I can't. If you don't shut him up, I will! You can't go anywhere, detective! The Big Shit has a long arm! Tell me where the Duchess is and you can go. Fuck it! Are you stupid as well? What's wrong? Is he sick? He's... he's... scared. No, he's sick. I know that illness. He has a temperature. Are you there, Cornelio? What are you waiting for? To see the sun rise. What have you done? Murderer! My son isn't breathing. You took his breath away. That was his illness. Without air, he won't cry again. I want my son to breathe! - You want him to keep on bawling? - Yes! All right. It's your lookout. But you must do what I say. He has to come down from there. But it isn't easy, because he's the real stubborn kind. Him? Yeah, him. The detective. The de... detective? Don't repeat everything I say. It makes me nervous. If he comes down and leaves... ...the Big Shit will make your son breathe again. - The Big Shit? - He can do everything. And where is he? He lives far away. In the Blue House. How can I get there? Come here. He knows, but if he doesn't come down it's impossible. No detective, no breathing. So now you know ! You go up and I'll wait down here. Come on. We're going to... ...the Blue House. - What do you know about that? - You know where it is. Did he tell you that? He stopped my son's breathing. He did that? The bastard! - Your son isn't breathing? - No, he isn't. He killed him? What's your name? Maria. Like everyone. Well, listen to me, Maria like everyone. If your son isn't breathing, he's dead. And death doesn't give back what it takes. The Big Shit can do anything. I see. They're having you on. The Big Shit can do anything? Don't you believe that. I know him, I worked for him. What do you charge? What? What do you charge for your work? - I can pay you. - You can't pay me. Don't you want to work for me? Do you want to work for me? If you take me to the Blue House, yes. You're a strange girl. I don't think you'd be any use. I know how to get down from the roof. - Come on. - It's that way. Here, take my coat. I'm going with you. Throw it down ! - Now, you go home. - No! Your son needs a doctor. I don't want them to take him away. I'm going with you ! I'm going with you ! Wait! I won't get in the way! Detective! Hello, little greaser. Have... have you.. ...seen... seen a man? You want to... to know if... ...if we've seen... seen a man? Hey, guys. Have... have you seen a man? A man? You're looking for a man? How about this? Put it away. Now, where have you come from, you little bitch? Are you a dirty nigger or white trash? I'm not from here. Kneel down. Didn't you hear? Kneel down. Put out your tongue... ...and start... ...licking. Didn't you hear him, stupid? Lick. And now... ...take it with both hands... ...and put it inside. It doesn't fit. It doesn't fit. And this way? Will it fit this way? Come on, open up. Yes, it fits. Good, very good. Don't hurry, do it slowly. We've got lots of time. You like that. Leave something for later. Now it's my turn. If it doesn't fit up above... ...it'll fit down below. And afterwards... ...you little shit... ...what we'll do with you... ...is we'll make a lovely belt... ...from your filthy Jewish skin... ...and we'll use your stinking tits to make soap. Come on, get the petrol can. Where are you going? Know who we are! Hear our drums! We're going to finish you off! Come out of there, you bitch ! Come out! Come out! Do you hear? Nigger... Run back home to Momma. Come out of there. Come on. You can't go round provoking people. Where's the detective? He went off. He went off? Where is the Blue House? Hello. Hello. Have you seen a man? Hello, Maria. I have something to show you. Look... ...at what I found today. Someone lost their smile. Ha... have you se... seen a man? These are hard times. I'm not very lucky. Once I found a hand with a ring on it... ...and they give me two big ones for it. Money was worth something then. Those were good times. Not like now. A man passed by. What do I get if I tell you where he went? I haven't got anything. Give me your glasses. He passed by a while ago. He gave me this. But it doesn't write. He's going to take the last bus. He was wearing a black coat and city shoes. He must be a foreigner. He didn't know that the ghetto buses... ...never leave or go anywhere. I'm going with you. Why don't you go see your child's father? I don't know who he is. I used to be a whore but not any more. Keep it with you... ...for when death pays you a visit. I don't know that song. It isn't a song, it's a bit of advice. I don't like your advice. It isn't mine. It's Al Capone's. He got it from his mother. - How are you? - All right. I'm glad to see you. Shall we have a drink? I want to see you alone. Rosa... Take my brother to my office and look after him. I'll see you in a minute. Is this the Blue House? I want some advice, Ofelia. Now that's a change. Tell me what you would do if I were you. If I were you, I'd go to bed with me. It isn't a bad idea. When this mess is over, I'll do it. What mess? My brother's here. The boxer? Two months ago, a letter arrived for him. If I give it to him, he'll have problems. Don't give it to him. You'd do that? If that's the problem, yes. But if I don't give it to him, I'll be the one with problems. Then give it to him. Is this the Blue House? Did they leave you to soak? They gave me a bath. Do you work here? Do you? Just on public holidays. Didn't you see my act? It's very original. It was my idea and people like it. I've got a contract for Miami, you know... ...but I'm still considering it. Can you dance? - No. - Doesn't matter. It's easy. You go on stage. No problem. It's real easy. Foot down, foot up, foot down, foot up. You run forward, not too quickly... ...two steps, and that's it. We'll go far together. Are we in the Blue House? I don't think so. Are you feeling better? You hear about Dad? He's in the hospital. He won't last the week. They're doing all they can, but it's no good. I saw to everything. Here. Light it first. Wait, I'll prepare it. Don't think I'm happy. I've got everything. Things are going well. I should be happy. But I can't stand happiness. Blow before you inhale. It reduces the nicotine. I remember teaching you to ride a bike. If I tried to cycle now, I'd fall off. I'm expecting a letter, I gave your address. It came two months ago. Did you open it? You're lying. You've read it. All right. I had a look at it. What does it say? Nothing. Just an address. What is it? I don't know, I don't remember. Good. And if you ever do, forget it again. Is that woman so important? How do you know it's a woman? The writing. It's typed. See? I don't even remember. But you knew it was a woman and there's no name. I knew. How? By the scent. Anyone else smell this letter? Who is she? Nobody. Nobody is nobody and you're you. I know you. What's going on? Tonight I have to do something I don't like. Don't do it. If I don't do it, what do I do? Why do you have to do it? You think I got all this by doing what I had to? If I've got on in life, it was by doing what suited me. Don't laugh. I'm serious. I'm your brother, I want the best for you. You're my brother and you've a gun in your pocket. - How do you know? -Intuition. And I can see it. It's for when death calls at my door. Pretty, isn't she? - Is she with you? - I don't know her. So why is she with you? I don't know. Am I interrupting? Ofelia, come here. This is Cornelio. Hello. I've heard a lot about you. I was dying to meet you. Is that your wife? No, we're going to the Blue House together. What's that? Another night club? He's asking questions. Do you know him? It's him! I can have him thrown out. No, on the contrary. Keep him occupied. I'll see to it myself. Leave by that door. - I'm going with you. - No, you stay here. She's to stay here till I've gone. Then send her home in a taxi. No! I'm going with you ! I'm going with you ! Which hospital is Dad in? Shall we dance? Thanks, but I can't. I'm not sitting down to keep you company. I respect your solitude. But don't you respect mine. Talk to me. Do you come here often? No, but I know the owner. Have a drink. It's on the house. - What are you drinking? - Water. Whiskey, straight. You don't fool me. Something's wrong. I can tell by your eyes. Show me your hand. No, the other one. This is your fate, the other's your character. First, your fate. Then, what you do with it. - That's what matters. - What do you see? Nothing. We'll look at your character. That's strange. You have them reversed. This is your fate. Are you left handed? That depends. With left-handed people everything's reversed. I see here that you're looking for a man But if you were, you wouldn't be waiting. I'm not waiting. Show me your hand. You work here. You're the owner's wife. You know who I am and why I'm here. Where's Cornelio? I don't understand. What do you want? To see you. Be careful. A word from me and you're out. Move, and I kill you. Go away, Ofelia. No, she stays. - He wants Cornelio. - Don't say you know nothing. I know nothing. Again. I know nothing. That's better. Tell me again. He was here. He left a while ago. Where? Tell him. Yes? Your taxi's waiting. You can't go like that. Go and get changed. That dress attracts flies... ...and in this city all the flies are poisonous. And it isn't my dress. It belongs to the club. Come here. Do you know you're very pretty? Small, but pretty. Your skin is white and smooth. Growing old is horrendous! You don't understand. It doesn't matter. Even I don't understand what's happening to me... ...since he took up with that fucking singer. You think I'm bitter because he doesn't love me? That I don't understand you because I have no children? You're wrong, because he does love me. He just doesn't know it. And I didn't have children because I didn't want to. I've come to get Miss Ofelia's gun. Here, don't let him see it. Come on in. Tell her... ...that it isn't here. She can stick the flower up her ass. I used to be the one who did that act. Without the gun. I sang like Marlene. And at the end of the act... ...instead of shooting a flower... ...I made a gesture with my hand... ...like this. Go fuck yourself! I ha... have to go. And you want your son... ...to come back to life? Look at this. Take a good look! They all had a mother who cleaned their asses. If that child came back to life... ...he'd end up like one of them. Dirty and perfumed! Stupid and common ! They should never have been born ! I want my son to be like other people. And the gun? You can shove it. Elisa, come on. They're downstairs. They came together and I didn't know what to do. Hello, Dad. It's Cornelio. I'm here. I've come to see you. I don't know if you can hear. And I don't know what to say. I remember when... ...we went fishing together. We never talked. Why are you here? You must go. It's forbidden. He's my father. You left him on his own. I have orders not to give him his pills until later. Just a minute. I'll leave now. Don't worry. He's in no pain... ...I promise you. How do you know? We do everything possible so that he isn't. Wait. You think he can hear me? I think he can hear. I spoke to him a moment ago and he gestured with his hand. Forgive me for the harm I've done to you. Shall we fish... ...together? Get me... ...off the hook! I can't, I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. I should, but I can't. This can't be the only thing I did for you. Are you going? He's suffering. Don't leave him alone. Detective! Not you again ! I said you were to go home. You said... the hospital, to see your father. And I came. This way! Run ! At peace, at last. Did you steal it? Come on, hurry! Run, Maria! Run ! - Don't move. - I'm scared. Don't move. I'm not moving. It's over now, Maria. Take it easy. Take it easy. So you're lovers! I knew you wouldn't go far. Things have changed, Cornelio. The Blue House had news about the Duchess. She wants to go there tonight for Laura's birthday. The problems are over. We've to meet her on the White Bridge. We've to change the wheel. Want some candy? Stay in the car, Maria. You thing I'd trick you? No, but they might have tricked you. Or the Duchess might want to trick us both. Or BS might want to trick everyone. You go first, you won't trick me again. She isn't here. Women aren't punctual. You know the Duchess better than I do. I told you to wait in the car! Do it or I won't work for you. - Why didn't you take his gun? - Without his gun, he's nobody. - He might kill you ! - No, he's my friend. If he'd wanted to, he'd have done it. You're not stupid. Laura! Laura. You said you didn't want my gift. She's like me. She understands me. I'm glad, but she doesn't understand you. Yes, I know. It's just a trick. A game. Enthralling, but just a game. Don't leave me. I can't get home. I've lost my glasses. Come with me. They said you'd phoned the Blue House... ...and we were to meet on the White Bridge. But I see that you're not going. Isn't today Laura's birthday? Or is it tomorrow? What day was yesterday? Don't go. They're using me as bait to kill you. Who is that? Her name's Maria. Do they really want to kill me? Again? What was her name? Maria. Like everyone. I thought you'd come alone. Maria, wait here for me. How do I look? Don't move. Don't speak. I know what you'll say. Don't lie. But don't tell me the whole truth either. Time goes to bed with you. But it can't fuck you. Your eyes are still your eyes. But my liver... ...isn't mine anymore. It belongs completely to Martell. An excellent brandy... ...but it doesn't deserve you. Hangovers have shown me... ...the meaning of life. And when I fly high... ...I accept the fast descent. Why have you come? It wasn't to go to bed with you. I think that's awful. I need warmth. BS's skin is cold. Like a lizard's. I can't imagine him sleeping with you, or with Laura. You always lacked imagination. I don't need imagination... ...to know what they'll do with you if you go. The same as BS ordered you to do, and you didn't. Kill me. You believe that? Yes. You're wrong. I spoke to BS. He's going to die. He's leaving his affairs to partners. Laura wants to see me. And so does he. Where would you and I go? To Rio? To the Pole, or nowhere? What does it matter? We'd fuck and enjoy ourselves... ...until we got fed up with each other. Don't say it wouldn't be like that. It always is. You know that. Sooner or later, we all go home, Cornelio. Death has been BS's business. Arms, drugs, livers, pancreas... ...hearts. But you'd be a useless viscera for him. Irretrievable. Am I to spend the rest of my days... ...with your sacrifice on my conscience? I couldn't bear that. - You're not leaving here. - What will you do? Kidnap me? Carry me off to nowhere, like in stories? Impale me with your cock and pin me to the wall? Don't make me do it again ! I forgot you were a boxer. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me. I'd rather break your jaw than see you dead. You're not going back. You'll come with me, and we'll fuck till we're bored. And you'll live bored, but you'll live. That's why I came. I won't leave you in the shit just because the Shit calls you. And I don't give a shit that you like the Shit! We made a pact, Duchess. And you have to keep it. In Brazil... ...at the Pole... ...or nowhere. Was that a declaration of love? - A declaration of life. - It seemed a declaration of war. You're coming with me. You were to kill me, and you threw the gun in the sea. But now you're armed again. You've broken the pact too. Are you going to shoot? Come with me, Duchess. And if I don't, what will you do? You'll come. I usually take two drops to sleep better. I gave you the whole bottle. That's the dosage they give elephants. You've fucked everything... ...Duchess. Good night, sweet prince. Thank you for everything you couldn't do for me. - The detective? - He's sleeping. Give my dog some food. And take care of the detective. He needs it. Waken up! Waken up! Waken up! Detective! Waken up! Ma'am, a call from the Blue House. Hello, Duchess. Laura and I miss you very much. We're happy you've decided to come back to the Blue House. I like hearing your voice. I know it so well. It's my favorite music. I get a shiver each time I hear it. As if you were licking my back... ...before biting my jugular. Thank you. It isn't easy to forget the moments we spent together. The good ones or the bad ones? The worst ones make the good ones seem better. Time always ends up putting everything in its place. And your place is here, Duchess. It won't be easy. We'll try it. Is Laura with you? You're lying. Put her on the phone. I want to talk to her. She's asleep. Waken her. She'd rather see you. I want her to say it. Don't be afraid. She's waiting for you. She's beside you. I can hear her breathing, almost see her. Tell her I forgive her. But she'll never forgive me. Is that you, Laura? Listen to me. It's cold here. I'm sorry I didn't give you the warmth you needed... ...when I was like you. Now that you're like me... ...listen to me. Your father... ...the Duke... ...was a surrogate father. Your real father... ...is with you... ...in my bed. It's him. They'll tear your eyes out! That'll be my best birthday present! You shouldn't have said that. It was unnecessary. She knows she's going to die. Too late, Maria. I'd like to be like this always. Always... ...is never possible. Why are there words... ...which are impossible? To annoy people. Love... Is that possible? Be careful. If you say it, it goes away. And pain? When... When you say it, it stays. Maria... Come on. You must help me. You forgot the gun. You keep it. You don't work for me. I work for you ! Her eyes. And the detective? He disappeared. I may well see him again. He's the kind who likes to have the last word. If he does come, let him in. But he's not to leave. Laura... Your mother is dead. Murderess! Fucking hell! I forget the password! Hello, detective. Hold it! Hold it! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You shouldn't have done it. I knew you'd come... ...detective. Let me go! Did you want to kill a dying man? With your fists? How naive! I wanted to break your neck. You destroy all you touch before you kill. That's my style. You could have trusted her and let her live! Look, isn't it romantic! The repentant gunman ! The detective in love. Do I kill him? And who are you? Are you... ...the Big Shit? - How do you know? - He told me. She's crazy! He stole my son's breath away. I want you to give it back. Your son's dead? He isn't dead. He took his breath away. It was a joke. Did you kill her son? He was crying. Idiot! What's your name? Maria. I like you, Maria. But that man lied to you. I have some powers to take away life... ...but none to give it back. You can do everything! Give my son his breath back... ...and don't hurt the detective. Millions of tadpoles want to be frogs in this pond... ...where only the toad is king. And you want one more. He's my son. Stand up. I'll speak... ...to death about this. But I can promise nothing. You know him? Very closely. I want to see him. Tell me where he is. I do nothing for nothing. What could you give me? Whatever you ask. One life for another. It's a fair deal. I'll give you mine... ...if someone will look after my son when he breathes again. Let death decide! Laura! What breed are you, doggie? You stink! Are you death? What? I'm the only person who is me. I am me too. No! You are you. Can you bark? Calm down, Laura. Maria... ...wants to play. And hunger makes a dish tasty. Don't you want to play with her? Not with her. I want to play with him. I want him to see... ...my mother before he dies. She's alive! Hello, Cornelio. I've come back to the Blue House. Is this your latest business? Congratulations. A great fairground attraction. You can still be lovers until the lights go on. Do you call that immortality? A simple trick. Unfortunately, you can love but not fuck. Is she death? But her eyes have seen him. Where is death? It's just a trick. Let the detective go or I'll kill her! Don't! Stay where you are! If anyone moves, I'll blow this shit fly's brains out! In the name of the Duchess. She wouldn't have wanted this. Don't move, BS. The games are over. You'll get Laura when Maria and I are out of here. A car with one man can follow me. It will stay 150 feet away... ...and stop at a distance when I stop. If all that is done, I'll leave Laura on the highway. We can reach an agreement, I'll give you what you want. I want nothing from you. Then why did you come? Not just to hit me, surely? He came because I asked him to. You came for that lunatic? Yes. You knew Laura is what I love most. She's my last desire, my only love. You came to take revenge, to destroy me. Please! Security guard, 733. Attention, blue alert! The detective is armed, Laura is his hostage. - Do not shoot! - This is BS! Everyone stay at their posts. Keep calm, let them leave. This is BS speaking! Stay calm! Take it easy, Cornelio. It will be like you said. You have my word. I have your balls! Follow him, and when you have Laura, kill him! Don't move! Maria, if she moves, kill her. Put that out, idiot! The Duchess told you, didn't she? That's why you came. Tell me. Tell me that my father isn't dead. Tell me that he is my real father. You think I didn't know? I knew the first time he took me in his arms. I like to think of it when we make love. Shut up, you fool! Your mother loved you ! If you keep talking Maria will shoot. Don't move. Shoot, you bastard. Kill him! Well, Cornelio? Aren't you going to shoot? Don't let him get away! Kill him! Take it easy, Laura. The detective is dead. I'm not going back there. Take me away. I'll pay you. I don't work for money. - I'll let you caress me. - Or for love either. Then do it because I order you, you fool! Good-bye, Cornelio. I'll never understand you. My son is dead. It was all a joke. Well, Maria. This is where you get out. Maria... That's enough. Get out. The fantasies are over, Maria. I'll cure you, detective. I'm dying, Maria. Leave me alone. Get out! Detective... Here, Maria. That man from the sewers gave me these glasses for you. Don't forget to make my bed... ...and then shake out the rug. Where were you all night anyway? That baby... What's wrong with that baby?
