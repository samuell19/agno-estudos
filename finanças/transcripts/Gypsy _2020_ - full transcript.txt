They have brought 218 accused for inquiry. Numbers are increasing. Officials will torture us with inquiry commission. We can use them for head counts. Political pressure cooks us like meat balls Journalists will surround us with too many questions. - Sir... - What is it? The one who got exposed in media... ...their party's cadre. He is in our custody now. Lock him up and leave now. Anyways they will bail me out tomorrow. Until then take care of us. - Get us dinner from Gupta restaurant. - Shut up. Don't forget to buy smokes.

All get into the vehicle leaving your thumb impression. Go straight. Get in. Now. - Lets start. - Go straight. Hurry up. Were you all beaten in police custody? Don't be scared. Speak out. - Experienced any custodial violence? - No Look at those scars. Silence. Provisional detention of these accused... ...without judicial trail for past one year. ...considered to be unlawful. Custodial torture on defenseless citizen violates fundamental rights. Only because of Right to know the Truth ...and its member has brought this case to court's notice. This act of brutality by the police saddens me. This court strongly condemns the officials for the abuse of power. Court acquits all the detainees at once. and orders to provide sufficient medical assistance for them. "My Heart melts. Oh lord Muruga!" "When I behold your feet." "My Heart melts. Oh lord Muruga!" "When I behold your feet." "When I grab and embrace you." "When I grab and embrace you." "When I grab and embrace you."

Our entire livelihood was burnt in that riot. If we are forced out of the country then... ...they'll feel much relieved. "Singing with excitement about you." "Makes us to long for your appearance." "Riding the dancing peacock..." "Riding the dancing peacock..." "My desire grows large..." "My Heart melts. Oh Lord Muruga..." "When I behold your feet." "My Heart melts. Oh Lord Muruga..." "When I behold your feet." No one knew your whereabouts. With this photograph. I went on to search your wife. She lives with her father in Calicut. We went there and, we couldn't speak to her. Her Father stopped us. About Waheedha... ...and including other victims... ...I thought of organizing a concert called Where is God. But, government authorities stopped me. It's a big surprise in meeting you again. You're wife will be even more pleased in meeting you. You should go right away meet her. That shall bring her back alive. 'Kozhikode, Kerala' Way to Muthalippu house. - Go straight and turn left. - Thanks. Wahee... I am home. Honey... Waheedha... Ma...! Why do you come? You come here to disturb her peace? Where here after being shamed in Nagore. Why did you come here? Do you want to drive us away elsewhere? They killed my horse in the riot. I was jailed. Waheedha...I'm alive only through your memories. I knew I can get you back. This Our baby. Come lets go... Don't you touch her? She is half dead because of you. She is done with you. God has given my daughter back. It's the forgiveness of the Nagore saint. It's a sin for her to see you again. Get lost...Get lost. Get away from here. Let me talk to her. Waheedha. Waheedha come with me. He ruined my daughter's life. Now he is trying to kill her. - Please calm down. - Don't I'm going to call the cops. Scoundrel...I thought he was dead. Get out. - Police station... - Yes. Long live the revolution...! Long live the revolution...! Gypsy. When did you come? You look lifeless. Where is your horse? Let's go inside. Long live the revolution...! Long live the revolution...! We held several meetings condemning the riots. I didn't know you were also a victim in it. They destroy people polarizing them by their caste and religion. Throughout the country... ...prisons are filled by detaining innocents. Your wife... After the riots this photo was circulated in every magazine. This man whose is raising sword... ...also circulated along... Face of the victim. Face of the violence. These two photos were projected as the faces of the riot. They remembered this riot... ...Only through your wife's photograph. I came to know that she lives in this locality. We tried to organize a meeting with the victim. It didn't happen. But her father denied. Didn't let her out. He refused to talk to media. Her father is a fundamentalist. Look at her eyes... I think. She is yet recover from the tremors of violence. It needs time to heal. Her father takes advantage out of it. Don't worry. This is our place. I will try to convince her father. When you leave you this place. You'll be accompanied by your wife and daughter. Got it. - Biju... - Coming. - Can't I tune this peacefully? - Shut up. You must be knowing him? Gypsy...The best singer. I have ever witnessed. It's not that simple to meet such talents. Make arrangements for his stay here. "The palm wine we drank yesterday." "Is what makes me sing now." "Five bottles of wine with six eggs." "We drank it in one sitting." "When my dude came by the river." "We partied together." This is my bed. Out of generosity. I'm giving it to you. Balan said you're a popular singer. I doubt it. If dare to open your mouth in this place. I will break your teeth. Understood. Don't dare to touch my guitar. This is not just another instrument. Worth it more than my wife. I warn you... "When my dude burst into tears." "Oh! Girl. My heart broke into pieces." "The palm wine we drank yesterday..." "...Is what makes me sing." "Five bottles of wine with six eggs." "We drank it in one sitting." Who are you? Where are you from? Do you have any identity? I was told that my parents were killed by a Muslim. My horse was killed, My wife was separated... ...by a Hindu. - This is all that I remember. - Listen. We are Urdu Muslims. We offer prayer five times a day. If a women don't abide by the religion. She must pay heavy price for it. We have suffered enough. He left her in the streets. Why do you dwell in the past? Gypsy is the husband of your daughter. This marriage was performed according to Muslim law. Sir...This is not your party office. He was married to my daughter and they have a child. And I will not offend the Muslim law So according to Muslim law. My daughter needs a divorce agreement. Prophet should arrange this. Failing to see his wife over a period of one year. And if have not provided for her maintenance. Then this woman can dissolute her marriage. It's in the rule book. One month from now... ...we will meet again in this court. To pronounce khula to this dissolute marriage. Then you don't have rights to trespass my house. Is that clear? Our decision is made. - Whose decision is this? - My decision. Who else then? I need my wife's consent. A woman cannot overturn a man's decision. My daughter hates you. Let my wife to say this to me. Muthalippu...Bring your daughter. Stay here. My daughter is here. Your decision for this divorce agreement. Speak out. Child...Do you agree to this? Say it. What's your decision? Waheedha. Four weeks from now. We will meet again to end this settlement. I will pronounce talaq myself. 'The most hated of the lawful things to God...' '...is talaq (Divorce)' , says Quran. The most hated word by God... ...is now being offered to my beloved wife. Prophet said, 'Separation of two hearts...' '...shakes the very throne of God'. With these conflicts... ...you may belittle your own God. He has agreed to pronounce talaq. Give him the period of waiting. (i.e) 3 months. You have asked for khula behalf of your daughter. We want to consider his concerns too. If a women pronounces khula once. their relationship will cease forthwith. However for men to pronounce talaq thrice, there is a waiting period. Hence we should address his concerns too. This council will meet again next Friday for the first talaq. This is our resolution. "Little smile of you." "Sketches your face in me." "Wheel of my life." "Revolves around you." "Like the flesh and bone." "Like the ceaseless waves." "Like a mother to daughter." "Come back to me." "An irreplaceable relationship." "An undying music." "An inseparable daughter." "Come back to me." "Before the sky dawns." "Come back. My little girl." April 27 riots is an unforgettable event. Waheedha's photo became the face of the violence. April 27 riot shocked the whole country. Waheedha became a photographic evident in this riot. Post riots she lives with her family in Calicut. Yesterday a mysterious man came to her residence with guitar. Performed a song in front of her house... ...that disturbed the peace of the locals. On receiving a complaint Calicut police intervened. Later arrested the man for trespassing. According to Muthalippu's complaint. His name is gypsy. Aforesaid man is the husband of Waheedha. He had already traveled to several parts of the country... ...performed music that made controversies. Kerala police sources confirmed. This incident has raised tension in and around Calicut. If you want to lock him up for singing. You should start with K.J. Yesudas. Gypsy is just a beginner. We shall deal with it later. Don't you dare to disturb him again? Release him now. Comrade. To rescue your wife. I am risking my wife. Go for it. His songs are not just a personal outcry. It's a loud cry for the whole society. Gypsy's song must go viral throughout the country. - This is our political activity. - OK Comrade. Movie songs and other videos trends in internet. This must reach the people. This is also a form of protest. Got it. "Like a rainbow your smile. Whose almighty wiped it?" "Like long wings your freedom. Whose almighty clipped it?" "To see my beloved." "I crossed the sea and mountains." "To Show your milky face." "Come back. My little girl." Would you like to continue this relationship? Aren't they asking you? Say it. She is not willing to come with you. You may pronounce the first talaq. In front of this council... ...I am pronouncing the first talaq... Talaq. First talaq is pronounced. You will pronounce the second talaq in due course. "In an immoral nation." "Whose blood fills the street?" "Setting fire on our diversity." "Whose peace is burning alive?" "On to your folding hands."

"Is unbearable." Talaq. "Come fall in my shoulder." "To shed tears." Everybody should disperse. Gypsy was detained in his wife resident. Yesterday near writer S.K Pottekkatt statue. Gypsy was arrested by Calicut police for unlawful assembly. He has been continuously performing around Kerala mostly in public places. He not only writes songs for his wife... But also for all social injustice across the country. Gypsy was arrest for disrupting law and order, ...singing against nation's sovereignty... ...unlawful assembly and he was booked under several other sections. What? Sir. He wants to piss. Do you want to piss? Drink this... Drink it. Scoundrel. Drink it. You wanted to piss. Right? He says he wanted to piss. Give him water. Gypsy What crime he has done? Is it for music? We all have freedom of expression. It is called democracy. - Got it? - Stop it. He sang in public disrupting law and order. It's an order from high officials. - I'm not answerable to you. - I know all your foul plays. News media is waiting outside. Release him before it becomes a sensation. Yes sir. OK Sir. OK Sir. We shall release him. Release him. Ask him to leave. Everybody clear off. Let's go Gypsy. Get lost. Comrades... Wait a second. Stop him. You. Hold on. Sir. Comrade is really pissed off.

Comrade has come. - Red salute comrades. - Red salute comrades. Do not disturb him. Take your seat. - Give us a bottle of palm wine. - Two bottles? Waheedha. When she agreed for the divorce... ...She appeared to be a strange person. Comrade... I couldn't bear that pain. I don't know why is she so scared of me? Comrade. Comrade. Senior said, 'Death is a beautiful rest'. His death was not that painful to me. Only two things I loved most in my life. My horse. My wife Waheedha. My horse was dead. He was burnt in front of me. Now. I am only left with Waheedha . She is burning inside me. Right here. Right here. Her face appears to me everywhere. If I pronounce the final talaq... ...then I cannot see her forever. Comrade...I want to live with my wife. I want to hold my baby. She is everything to me. Only her love. If she is beside me. Then I am a Millionaire... ...an Artist, A King. What is it Comrade? Bursting into tears. Didn't you marry Waheeda by eloping? Then why do you have to worry... For few people risk is part of their life. But for you. Life offers nothing but risk. Comrade...This is nothing to you. Why are you hesitant? I am on your side. I'll deal her father with a punch in his face. When her father is away from home... You meet her and... ...take her far away from his eye sight. What are you thoughtful about? About the horse? Don't worry about it. I will be your horse. Want to see a horse now? Speak out Comrade. Look at this. I will become a horse If takes to bring your wife back. I will be your Che. Take your wife and daughter. Leave as soon as possible. Live with them happily forever. Comrade. Comrade...! Take a look at this. Comrade... This belongs to friend of mine. Who lives in Calicut Beach. How is it? Comrade...Go get her. Follow me. Comrade...Stay here... Her father went outside. Let's move. Obey me Chaplin...! Comrade. If her father comes back... I will shout the God is greater. If police arrives, I will shout long live revolution. Go get her Comrade. Long live revolution. Waheedha... Come out... What you want? My baby. Waheedha...Don't be scared. Let's start fresh. Waheedha. This is not my horse. You have also changed a lot. You said it on your marriage ceremony... ...to take you away with me. Now I insist the same. Come let's go now. Waheedha... I will make all your wishes come true. We shall build a house near TajMahal. I will stay there to look after... ...you and our baby. I miss you and our baby a lot. Waheedha... Baby... Daddy is here... - Leave the baby alone... - Let me have... - Little dove. - Give her back. - Leave the baby. - Ask Waheedha to come. - My sweet pumpkin. - He took the baby. - Giver her back or else... - Ask her to come. Give the baby back. Give her back. Call Waheedha out. - Do it now. - Sister. God is Greater. God is Greater. Chaplin... Run away. Bison Brother... May peace be upon you. God is Greater... One more person to come. I am your daddy. It's daddy. How sad? I don't even know your name. Let me think of a name for you. White dove. White little dove. White little dove. We shall bring back your mommy soon. Look here. Look here. We are home. Little Dove. Daddy is here. Let's sit here. Let's sit here. Look here. My little Dove. Look at here. Baby don't cry. I am your daddy. Look here. Look here. It's a hungry cry of a baby. Look here. My little dove. Look at here. Look at here. My little bunny. My Bitsy. My Little pumpkin. My little dove. It's alright. We will be fine... "Lullaby" Rascal, Scoundrel. - To the party leader's house. - OK we will. Two of you check in the party office. Let's move. Daddy. Daddy. Fajila. Don't. One minute. Her father came here with the prophet. I have tried to convince him. Tomorrow... He has asked you to pronounce the third talaq. I might have dealt it easily. If it is not religious. They will threaten to politicize with religious sentiments. Your wife is unwell too. We have to maintain patience. Stay calm. Take a look at this. During freedom struggle many revolutionists were... ...underground right there. Stay here for a while. They can't dissolute your marriage without your third talaq. Why should I hide? 'There is politics in the relationships of human being', says Marx Politics also distorts the relationships of human being. Comrade. Follow me. You are right. Politics distorts the relationships of human being. Who does this? Why they do this? Think about it comrade... One minute. She is even scared of me. I don't know what exactly happened for her in the riots. Ever since then. She started panicking for all things. When she left us... I thought she would get a life outside. But she came back like an insane person. She is even scared of you. She is just like an vegetable. God knows how to cure her illness. Everything in the country is politicized. In war, riots and in all clashes... ...women are considered as their honor. Women are easy targets to shame. In war why do they rape women? Why a girl is made to run nude? Why do they rape a girl inside the temple? Why should a school kid die in the bomb blast? Why is your wife separated from you? Who masterminds all these? Think about it. Innocent people's Language,Race... ...Caste, Religion, Land, Hunger, Pain, Love. He who politicize these things. He who mint money out of everything. He is our enemy. He who spread hatred amongst us. He is our enemy. He should be destroyed. It is enemy who decides on our weapon. We should snatch that weapon before he does. If innocents were attacked... They must realize that we will also take our revenge. Muthalippu... Aren't they coming? We are waiting in the assembly. Gypsy is missing. Don't play your games. Believe it not. He is not here. I am also wondering where he has gone. "I found human hated another human. Feeling the pain of separation." "The difference in language, religion, and race..." "...using it to spread hatred. It is terrorism." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads to divide people is the disease of terrorism." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads to infect people is the disease of terrorism." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads to divide people is the disease of terrorism." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads into each nation. Will it not be gone." After the riots many were missing. The sword man is missing ever since then. Sevapuri residents might know about him. "Swinging like an axe I am coming for you." "Like a roaming militant from a burnt slum." He is an Sevapuri resident. He went missing after the riots. "In how many ways these religious goons can separate people?" "Retaliating is needed." "Using muscles to curb the free speech is a crime." "With all stacked artillery..." Whose God is accountable? Yours or mine. My dad was burnt alive. He went to bazaar with his daughter. We came to know he dead only through news channel. They burnt my cat and house. They killed my mommy to save God. I am going to kill him. I am going to stab him. "There is no boundary to this land." "We dig lands only to excavate skulls." "I'll come for you. to revenge with your own weapon." "In wires of the bomb. A parting kiss." "After many blood sheds. still roaming to incite riots?" "Blood dripping on the floor belongs to our brothers and sisters." "Disease. Terrorism is a disease." My sister gave birth to a child. It's our blood. One more to strengthen our army. How are you? We shall go home soon. Sir. Many have lost their lives. Your daughter is lucky to be alive. Lord Kasi Viswanath had saved your daughter. "Terrorism is disease. Terrorism is disease." "Women are worshipped in this nation. lustful killing still exists." "Arrogance in separatism. Will it not change?" "Women are worshipped in this nation. Lustful killing still exists." "Arrogance in separatism. Will it not change?" "For Food, For Rights. Kids who long for love in poverty." "With pride, barbarians who prey on innocents." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads to divide people. The disease of terrorism." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads to infect people. The disease of terrorism." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads to divide people. The disease of terrorism." "Disease. Disease." "Spreads into each nation. Will it not be gone." "The disease of terrorism." What do you want? Who are you? Move it. [Chanting mantra] There was a time... People were scared even to pronounce my name. Now, even street kids call me a psychopath. They made me to do all these crimes in the name of God. That's why this punishment. All my sins make me sleepless. There isn't any sacred river to wash away my sins. Despite doing all these crimes for the sake of God. I went into temple to worship the very same God. My fellow men... ...threw me out of temple saying, I am a lower caste. They chopped both of my hands. The man who made me to participate in this riot... ...is now the chief minister of this state. My fellow men had became his ministers. They all had ignored me. I worked for them when they needed me the most. I am not with them anymore. They threatened to kill my family by sending goons... ...fearing that I will be their whistle blower. I realized this only after being hospitalized. Words like Caste, Religion, Hindu, Muslim are words... ...to divide people. Who asked to bomb in the name of Allah? Who asked to murder in the name of Lord Ram? Do not believe the person who depict our God as murderers. This is my wife. She is the bread winner of my family. She is been shamed because of me. Like her, Many families are suffering because of me... I may rot in hell. I am a rioter one among who participated in this huge riot. Like me many where brain washed. Being uneducated I have become a criminal. My children should go to school. They will get education. Only then this will all be changed. Like Waheeda and me. ...many families across the country living a sorrowful life. Like my horse. Many lives were burnt alive. Many children. Many mothers. Many more rioters. Sword and Gun hurts another human. It is music which heals another human. Gypsy. Waheedha's father came to our party's office. He wants you to pronounce the final talaq. He threatens to arrange another marriage for your wife. Your wife's mental illness is yet to be cured. I am going to take this matter to court. Leave it Comrade. Ask him to bring Waheedha here. I will pronounce the final talaq. We are not done fighting this. It's alright Comrade. According to Muslim law... Talaq can be pronounced with the council. Where I was married. They can settle this dispute. Only if they come here. At least I may get the final glimpse of My wife and child. Gypsy. Gypsy. World needs... ...peace, love and humanity. The two faces of the riots... ...Will meet in this concert. Presenting... Gypsy's peace concert. Last year the violence erupted in Lallapura Varanasi. It spread across five districts. ...and it lasted for 24 hours. 1044 people were killed. 3000 people were missing. 258 including men, women, children were burnt alive in this massacre.

I am a resident of Sevapuri. Truth is... I was part of Lallapura Hindu-Muslim riot. Everyone knew about it. It is media who exposed it. The man who masterminded the riot... ...is none other than our chief minister. I was a cadre in his party for a very long period. I never seen such a blood sucking leech in my entire life. I had set fire to houses in the riots following his instructions. Stabbed many with swords. Our countries progress in not his ambition. One nation, one religion, one language... ...is his motto to destroy the plurality of this country. He wants to polarize people for votes... ...to gain his political supremacy is his objective. He will go to any extreme to achieve it. He will kill anyone to get it. Expose this before it is too late. Allegations on Chief minister in links with April 27 riots. Allegedly Chief ministers in connections with April 27 riots... ...there is a already pending trial in the high court. Will Anilmochi-Waheedha meeting happen? What are its political consequences? Questions multiples waiting to be answered. It's a nice to see it on TV. If I was aware of this already. - State would have sponsored this event. - Absolutely. We should have known this beforehand. We should not react to this now. We will not harm them now. You have to travel to Varanasi... ...for your daughter's final talaq. If not... This will be dealt only in court. Country identifies a Street singer. Rise of a street singer. Street singers voice echoes. Gypsy hits the headlines on most of the newspaper. Support for the singer from masses... ...has increased expectations for his peace concert. One more day to go for the Gypsy's concert. Hash tags like Stand with gypsy, Stand for gypsy, Gypsy's peace concert ...has flooded into twitter,Facebook and all social media. He was the chief minister Only because of this riots. ...and you are the leader for youth wing. He is in power. Hence he will not act directly. We should accomplish his wish. Do it.
