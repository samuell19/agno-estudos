Charo, right? - Yes. We got here early. It's through here. We're going to start soon, okay, Charo? You've done this many times, but if, for whatever reason, you get nervous, let me know and we'll stop. - This isn't live, okay? - Thank you. Just relax, we're doing this to help you. So, just relax. Recording. You'll know by now that Elche has been in the hot seat recently. The city has garnered national media attention, this time, due to some sad news, which has left us all with a heavy heart. As of today, it has been 25 days since the disappearance of little Vanesa, the ten-year-old whose whereabouts have been unknown since that fateful Tuesday in February. Today, we're here to tell Charo that we haven't forgotten Vanesa and that we're still supporting the case by doing our part. How are you holding up? I imagine not very well, right? No. Charo, you're 24, you were a very young mom. You also have another daughter, Vanesa's twin. You're quite the fighter, right? - Your daughter is Verónica, right? - Yes, Vero. How are you and your daughter Vero holding up? I suppose that, as awful as this situation is, at least you're feeling the public's support. Yes. What I would like to say is that if you see Vanesa anywhere or any little thing, please call 116 with any information. We'll put the number at the bottom. This is the number that the police set up for missing persons. With regards to the investigation, we've heard that the police are focusing on those with ties to the girls' dad who died recently… Sorry, but the police advised me not to talk about that. Sure, it's still an open investigation. Well, as I was saying before, this is Vanesa's twin sister. - Hi, Vero. - Hello. The clothes she's wearing are the same as the ones Vanesa wore the day she went missing. Could you stand up and give us a twirl? That's right. Vanesa was wearing a very distinctive backpack like this. It's a cat. Yes, but Vane's had two eyes. Oh, two eyes. Could you turn around? - Her hair was also the same, right? - Yes. They're identical, like two peas in a pod. Remember, if you've seen a girl who looks exactly like this, please call the number that appears on the screen. It's a 24-hour phone service and any clue, any evidence, however small, is relevant. Thank you for your cooperation. There is a place where magic exists. Do you dare to visit it? Open your mind and be swept away by mystery. At the New Dawn occult shop, you will find products to guide you towards your mystic destination. At Spain 2 Footwear you'll find what you're looking for. You have the right to live in peace. You have the right to keep on smiling. Legal advice services… INMO-GALAXIA ESTATE AGENCY Total square meters is one thing and living space is another. Yes, Pascual, it is fit to live in. But you can't go between the walls where all the plumbing and pipework and stuff are. You can't live there, even if it is in your building. The legislation for selling apartments works with living space and total square meters. We didn't make the rules. Pascual, we're friends, do you really think I would con you? I have to go. The office is closing and I have visitors. If you want, we can meet tomorrow. I'll take you out to breakfast and I'll clear up this whole apartment business for you. Okay, thanks, Pascual. See you tomorrow. Bye. "Dear colleagues and friends, "we have gained a week of experience in our lives since our last meeting. "Seven days in which we, tiny humans, have let cosmic events pass us by. "Whilst we were busy with our earthly misfortunes, "a million stars exploded up there and another million were born. "Thousand-year-old civilizations vanished, "wars between spatial forces were declared, "and races from different worlds signed pacts of brotherhood. "Reflecting on the week since our last meeting, "I realize just how small we are," "like a microbe looking at an ant in awe because of its size." "With the utmost humility and awareness of our insignificance," "I welcome you to the 37th meeting" "of the Ovni-Levante Association of Ufology." Julio, before we begin, I'd like to add a document to the file. It's a photocopy of a news article in El Correo Español, from October 1984. I've made a photocopy for each of you, in case you're interested. "On 14th September this year, "in the city of Vitoria at 9:30pm, "a UFO was spotted, "leading to a 15-minute power cut across the whole city. "During this time, it got the electrical Timex Printer" "to break away from established programs" "and the usual computer codes," "and print a binary message which is as follows," "8-1-8-1-8-1…" Maybe it's not for us, right? It might've been an intercepted message for aliens. Or maybe it was for us, but we can't understand it. Many astral entities try to communicate with us through electronic devices, but either we don't understand, or we assume it's just noise or that it needs tuning. That reminds me… that there's a similar text echoing what you just told us. I want to share it with you. "On 2nd December 1978, "Emilio Carrascosa, a cement factory employee, "was driving down the road from Buñol to Godelleta, "when he saw a dazzling light in the sky. "At that moment, the radio, which was on, "had voice interference. "The voice was deep, intense, slow and monotonous," "clearly artificial, robotic." "It spoke in an unknown language." "He changed the station," "but the voice continued until the light disappeared." All of these phenomena that we've just heard about and read, are completely unfathomable to us nowadays. But I hope that over time and in the very near future, when the human mind and intelligence develop to their full potential, that all of these things will be comprehensible for us. Thanks, Raúl, for your contribution to the group. Thanks, Raúl. Regarding our sighting trip, have you brought us the measurements, Raúl? I have them here. I've already checked the forecast and it looks like good weather. All we need to do is sort out the cars, transport, and food for the whole allergy thing. I can't eat cheese. I can't either, or seafood or nuts or soy… Labor consultant, public prosecutor, and accountant Miguel Porras. You deal with your work or business and we'll deal with the rest. Count on Miguel Porras' expertise… Mom! José Manuel, careful with the lion. The lion's coming. The lion's coming. What? What did you see? A very big lion. It's outside. You can see it from the window. It has a very big shadow. Shut everything properly so it doesn't see us. Mom, is this what you saw? Yes, very big, like a house. It's coming soon and it's hungry. The lion's coming. EARLY MORNINGS WITH ANITA RUBIO It has now been 32 days since the disappearance of Vanesa. Our love and support go out to her whole family and all her loved ones. On another note, Easter's around the corner and we're joined by Antonio Tomás. He's President of the Main Committee of the Elche Brotherhood. - Good morning, Antonio. - Good morning. You've got quite the entourage. Yes, they're members of… If someone knocks on the door, be careful. They might look well-dressed, but they'll have an Eastern accent. They'll say they have perfume from a high-end brand, but they're selling it cheap as it's factory surplus. If you smell it, it puts you to sleep. They'll take a piece of you, open you up and take an organ. They usually take a kidney or the liver. They're Eastern European. That doesn't mean that they're all bad, but these are the worst of Eastern Europeans. Hi, Mercedes. José Manuel, listen, that woman over there is Mercedes and she's in a bad way. We can help her. Her husband died recently and she's felt his presence ever since. - Brigi, my mom can't do it anymore. - Well, we have to try. He's driving her crazy, moving furniture around, opening wardrobes. It would just be a case of having him enter your mom so she could talk to him and see what happens. She's done it before. I wouldn't ask if Mercedes wasn't desperate. No can do. My mom isn't my mom anymore. Find someone else, my mom can't do it now. There's no one like your mom. I know. I'm sorry, but no. Sorry, my mom's in a very bad way and she can't do it. - Hi, José, how's it going? - Hi. - How are you doing? - Hanging in there. Your colleagues gave me this to give to you. Tell them thanks, I mean it. Just as there's medicine for other illnesses, that's how we should view death, as a treatable and curable illness. We were created to be immortal and immortality isn't a godly thing, it's a human characteristic. So why do we die? The answer is simple. The alien scientists who created us are scared of us. They injected us with this fear of death to prevent us from finding and destroying them. They fear their creation will rebel against them. Immortality means having time to travel to their planet, the place from which our creators observe us. It takes thousands of years of travel to get there. Immortal beings could take on that cosmic journey. Now we're finally learning to free ourselves from death. We've all heard the stories about people who don't need to eat, who live off the sun or breath, or about those living in the Amazon rainforest who claim to be 300 years old… Vero, don't waste my battery. Austrian scientists left the nun, Teresa Neumann, alone in a room with no food or water, monitored 24/7. She survived without any food for over a month. Immortality is possible, it's innate to us. Coming up, I will reveal its secrets exactly as they're explained in ancient alien manuscripts hidden in the Vatican. I recommend downloading this video in case it gets taken down. Before creation, there was no Earth, nor sky, nor time, nor movement. The only thing that existed was what Egyptians called "primeval waters", an ocean containing the vital essence of the Demiurge, which somehow came to life to create itself first, then everything else afterwards. The Egyptians thought that water was the nectar of the gods, the place where spirits slept before embarking on the journey of life. We're certain that the ancient parchments being analyzed at the university's Dept. Of Egyptology contain secrets… Good, we're all here. I'm afraid I must inform you that my father, Julio, died two days ago of a sudden heart attack. He was buried today. I was told by your colleagues that once a week, you held association meetings in this office. From now on, you won't be able to hold meetings here. I'm taking over and there will be changes. I hope you understand. I've been going over my father's files and I found this with all of the association's files. I understand that it must now be in the Vice-President's safekeeping. According to the statutes, the person who has been tasked with this is "Cosmic Pharaoh". I don't know which of you that is. - José Manuel. - Me. Raúl, it's your grandad's birthday and I don't want you to miss it. Don't miss it because it's going to be a surprise. That's it. I want you to behave and be good. I want to feel proud of you, to be able to say, "My grandson is such a good, handsome boy." Okay, Grandma, don't worry, I won't be late. I can't talk right now or go visit you. I've just had some bad news. I'll see you soon. Did you know that Julio had a son? No. He never spoke about his private life. That's because we're his private life. I met him because in the last page of his book, he wrote, "I would be delighted to meet any readers" "who wish to join me on this astral journey, "and who have a PO box." So, I wrote to him. You have to think of it like a car: You look after a car, fix it, do it up to make it stand out, whatever it is. But a car lasts you a few years and this car is flesh. It seems like we die, but we get in another car and keep learning more, knowing more and getting wiser, and your car keeps improving. Julio's in a really fancy car now, so here's to Julio. OCCULT PARTY COSMIC POETRY RECITAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF UFO PHENOMENA SHARK SUPERMARKET This morning, at the Aparadora Gardens, the weekly protest took place carried out by workers of Elche's footwear industry, headed by the slogan, "More job security!" This gathering has turned into a weekly event and its organizers say it will continue until their demands have been met by the authorities. According to the Ministry of Labor, 40% of jobs in the footwear industry in Elche are carried out unofficially in homes and secret workshops in exchange for cash that business owners don't declare. This means no social security for a predominantly female workforce. We're here because we're sick of being enslaved. We work… - Hi. - Hi, Uncle. Mom, listen. Mom, it's Vane. Do you see her? Do you see Vane? Mom. Can you hear me, Mom? Mom, say something. Tell me you see her. Can you see her? Mom, it's me. It's Charo. Tell me you can see Vane. Please tell me you know where she is. Mom, talk to me, please. Did you see her, Mom? Talk. Do you know anything about her? Tell me you've seen her. Is this yours? No. This has been in space, you know. A man was wearing it when he was abducted. - Abdu… - Abduct. It's when aliens take you somewhere else. The person it belonged to was my friend and he was very famous, look. He wrote about his entire experience with the aliens. He did radio and TV interviews. People listened to his message. He was a remarkable guy. Did he die? Physically, yes. But life and death meant something different to him. I got nothing. All she said was, "Careful with your eyes." She said it a few times, "Careful with your eyes." Is your eyesight okay? Yes. Maybe you need to go for a check-up. It's better to use this kind of bread because it's softer and absorbs the batter more. It's like a sponge cake. You'll see how yummy they are. First, put butter on one side and mustard on the other. Here. Put quite a lot of cheese inside so it melts. Add some ham and then close it properly. Dip it in the milk first, then in the egg. Put it in the frying pan with a lot of oil. It was our favorite sandwich. Uncle José Manuel would always make them when we were home alone without your grandma knowing. She didn't let us use the frying pan with that much oil. We saw it a while back on Arguiñano's cooking show. It was the first thing we'd do when grandma had to leave, which was unusual, she always had visitors here. It only happened two or three times a year, right? Once, your grandma had to leave after lunch and we ended up having a second lunch. We'd eat them even when we were full. We made the most of any opportunity. It was like Christmas dinner. I haven't made them since I left home because I can't cook, otherwise, I would've made some for you girls. I was looking forward to them again. Me too. Leave me alone. I don't want you to answer or look at me, just hear me out. I really loved your husband, God rest his soul. He was like a son to me, the girls were like my granddaughters. The police won't stop questioning and following me, and I'm sick of it. I haven't done anything. I don't have anything to do with what happened. I did what I did in the past, but right now, I'm just trying to get by. I'm telling you for your peace of mind. Shall I weigh it? Pass it here. It's 1.7 kg, so that's two euros, okay? Okay. - How's it going? - Good. Look, just picked up the bike from the repair shop and it's fucking great. I might go to the mountains again and trash it. It's awesome. I added a disc brake. It's fucking awesome. Smooth as fucking shit. A neighbor of mine gave me another bike for free. So, like, now I have two. Okay, then. Talk soon, dude. Today is a bank holiday, so I have to charge the bank holiday fee. Does your insurance cover theft? No, it wasn't burglars. I left the key inside and had to break the lock. I thought it was people from Eastern Europe. Sometimes I see them break shutters that way. Could I have your name for the invoice? - Your name, please? - José Manuel García Martínez. - Congratulations. - Why? Today is your saint's day. My name is José, too. What was that? What happened? Your attention, ladies. The upholsterer collects the order and then delivers it to your home. Ask about prices and an estimate with no obligations. Attention: All jobs guaranteed with major discounts. Attention, attention. The upholsterer's van is in town. Residents were taken by surprise this morning by a powerful explosion. The cause was a gas butane bottle that was tampered with. Oh, my God! The occupant died immediately. The investigation is determining whether it was suicide or not. Neighbors claim that the woman, recently widowed, suffered from severe anxiety. It's a shame what happened, but it was on the cards. She was paranoid, said her husband appeared to her… Didn't leave her be even after he died! He threatened to do it, and he kept his word. He was an evil man. The most evil man on Earth. One of those… Mom, listen to me, please. This is important, okay? I need you to use the parts of your brain that work. I need to talk to Julio. Please bring him to me. Come on. Try and find him, Mom. It would mean sharing with my mom. We'd have to split the electricity and water bills. I was at the venue too when I was in the Static Modernism Association, until they fell out. Hey, Raúl. I was just telling José Manuel that my mom's Fibromyalgia Association shared a venue with singers who were dropping like flies. They can't find new choir members. They've lost interest or something. It would mean sharing the venue with my mom. We'd also have to split the electricity and water bills. I went there when I was in the Static Modernism Association, then they fell out. It's a bit cold inside, but summer will be here soon. It's boiling hot in summer though. Check it out. This is Miguel. He's always with me. This is the spaceship that took him away. This is how I picture Miguel now. This is a tribute to Maikel. This is the first tatt I got, my mom's name. I got this rose with eyes for my granddad. It represents the gods. The rose with a clock, it means time is precious. This is the skull the tattoo artist showed me. I liked it and had it inked. "Julio, space beckoned you, you listened to its call and heeded it. "You cannot ignore the call of space. "We know you were there before, "so we know you'll be in a cosmic home "full of wonders and advanced technology. "You escaped your biological form to become part of the cosmic oneness. "The body behind this niche "is merely flesh, with just a symbolic value. "A body is like a vehicle made of flesh that we renew now and again. "Now you have rejoined your cosmic friends, who taught us so much through you." "We will celebrate the night of the sighting in your honor." "Those of us still on Earth" "will look to the sky and search for a new star." "If you want to tell us something," "we will be watching and waiting this Saturday." "Signed by your colleagues, friends and disciples." "José Manuel, Raúl, Andrea, Raúl and Raúl." Another one. Another one. My mom asked me for some. She sprinkles soil on her bed, then she sleeps better. My gran used to do it, she fell fast asleep. - Want some? - I'll have a bit. You guys go ahead. I'm going to try and find my dad, all of this looks the same. - Bye. - Bye. Raúl, can I ask a favor? Could you drop me off? I have the craniosacral bio dynamics meeting. It's at eight, but there's a park over the way. I'll wait there. Sure thing. This is staying here from now on. No one is going to steal it again. No one. No one will steal it chained up like this. They'll never steal it. No one is going to steal this from me. It'll stay right here. Now they'll never steal it. I don't want anyone to take it away. No one is getting it. Now no one will ever steal it. You've got it, Paco. You've got this. Perfect. Perfect, Paco. Lift it a bit. Now you have it. Now you have the hang of it. He's a real hero. He needs to be well-fed or he won't have the strength! A nice bit of ham. He's stocky. He's stocky. It's like a dead weight. It weighs about 300 kilos. LIVING TOGETHER AS NEIGHBORS SUNDAY 25 - AN AFTERNOON OF FUN CHILDREN'S GAMES GRAND GYMKHANA WITH PRIZES! It reminds me of that girl who went missing in Portugal, the little blonde one. Her parents were on TV day and night, on the news, looking for her. Then I realized that they didn't have to bloody work. Don't say that. We're here to support you and help you with whatever you need. We can help you with work. We can do it between all of us. Thank you all, I mean it with all my heart. - You can count on us. - I know that. But work keeps my mind off things. Besides, the police told me I can't do anything else. You know what to do if you change your mind. Post a message to the group and we'll come. It's at times like this that we really have to pull together. Vero, don't eat everything we brought you all at once or you'll get a belly ache. One day at a time. Take care. Remember what we said. Hello? To cleanse and drain the energies and remove bad vibes in the air, you have to put it high up on a shelf in a glass jar. The water will turn black every month. Change the water and throw it in the toilet, with all the bad energy. And that's it. Don't touch the water, it's very dangerous. Wear gloves, then put it back in a jar on the shelf. Okay? Thanks. Bye. This was under the door. Someone could slip on it. HIS GAZE WILL BE EVERYWHERE I have to go, José Manuel. The police called me. I don't know where to, maybe Turkey. They think they found Vane, that's all I know. I have no one to leave her with. Could you take her? Behave yourself with Uncle. What's this? Pork loin with tomato. - What about this? - Garlic potatoes. - And this? - Fried chicken blood with onions. Is this Russian potato salad? Yes. What about this salad? It has surimi sticks in it. They're super affectionate. He doesn't ever make a fuss. Good boy! He loves bread. It's his weakness. Hop on to my shoulder. - Good boy! - What a performance. See that? They're really affectionate. They take a while to begin with… - Bit by bit. - What? Hop off. Good boy! If he doesn't know you, he won't go to you. He's a bit shy to begin with. Huh? What's that? You can play Candy Crush if you're bored. Okay. José Manuel. It's been ages since I last saw you. - How's your mother? - So-so. Sure, it doesn't get better. Hey, you look great. Are you okay? I'm good. This is my niece. Hi! You know that you'll always have a place here. Go take a seat while I sort out the PowerPoint. See you in a bit. José Manuel! How are you, sweetheart? It's been a long time. You've been neglecting us. How's your mother? Not good… We're always thinking of you. I'm sure she is thinking of us too. I dream of her a lot at night. I know that it's her, I sense that she's the one who visits me at night. Her mind flies free. This is José Manuel. My friend Carmina's son. She's a clairvoyant, but now she has Alzheimer's… I've known him since he was little. When we went to her house… Everything was leopard print, curtains, vases. She loved leopard print. He greeted us very politely and told us when we could go into the room. - Who are you, sweetie? - Thank you. Thank you to everyone once again. Thank you for coming here to the Silver Chord. Today's talk is going to be very interesting. Our guest is Ignacio Apaiza. This isn't the first time Nacho is with us. Some of you will remember him. And for those who don't know him, he describes himself thus. "A Cosmic Soul Pilot, an Astral Facilitator," "and a Sculptor of Emotions." All yours, Nacho. Firstly, I'd like to ask you to close your eyes. We will share this darkness. Now, slowly, I want you to open your eyes and see the world like you had just been born. In this room, there is someone special. Someone whose destiny is reflected in their eyes. I'll let each one of you think about it. "Is it me? Is it the person next to me?" "Is it David, who I thank once again for this invitation?" Who would that special person be? It doesn't matter who it is, because now I'm going to ask you to join together as if we were one single being. I ask you to synchronize our heartbeats. Focus on a single shared heartbeat. From this moment on, we are all one. This is what I refer to as "the metaphysical heartbeat". THE METAPHYSICAL HEARTBEAT … of bodily sacrifice. I prefer to call it "donation". The body is expendable. It is undoubtedly the least valuable thing we possess. What we cherish inside, however, remains intact. That feeling of joy carries us through life floating in the air, like it were cradling us. While the slumbering human crawls through the physical world, we spread out calmly through the astral one until we merge with the whole. This was your mom's room when she was little. Why do we never come here? Your mom and Gran had a row. Because Vane and me were born? Yeah. Gran wasn't pleased to be a granny so young, and she didn't like your dad. Because he was a heroin addict? Mom says that you can be a heroin addict and a good person as well. She says my dad was like that, but not his friends. What's the difference between a heroin addict and a coke addict? Well, heroin addicts are worse, but they're more relaxed. Coke addicts are always searching for something, they are jumpy. Now Gran doesn't understand anything or leave the house, right? No. Not in a wheelchair and with no lift. She hasn't been out for a year. But she likes TV. The doctor said turn on the subtitles. It's good for her memory, she has to read all the time. There's a boy in a wheelchair in my class too. - Is he a friend? - Yeah. He says the only good thing about a wheelchair is that nobody picks on you. FOR PERSONAL REASONS, WE'LL BE OPENING LATER TODAY José. José Manuel. I'm Julio. Come with me, please. This man is called José María. I can talk to you thanks to him. I've come back to tell you something very important. They took her away, didn't they? - She was ready. - Yes. I know who they are, they're watching me. They've been spying on the bar, they put stuff under the door. José Manuel, we must carry on as planned. There is her twin. But she's not ready. Only you know the prayers. Besides, it's tomorrow night. We still have time. You needed weeks of sessions with Vane. How will you do it in one day? It's different now. I'm not human anymore, I have more powers. What's it like where you are? It's impossible to describe it in human language. I understand. Julio, I'm so glad to be here with you again. Don't worry about the members, they think we're looking for UFOs. Look what I bought. We can use it tomorrow. A sentence. A sentence is a group of words that has a full meaning and is used to express ideas, feelings, things that happen, will happen, or already happened. That is a sentence. For example, if I say, "The teacher writes on the board" that's a… Are you not hungry, Vero? - I don't like it. - Hang on. Thank you. - Elena. - What's up? - I don't like this. - But they're chickpeas. I want the same as her. No. Come on, eat up. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. What about Pluto? My friend Manu has an old science book where Pluto does appear, but not in mine. Teacher says the new book is what counts and we shouldn't use old books. But Manu's mom can't afford to buy him a new one. It's good to learn these things, they're important. I like learning about the Solar System. And I like what we're doing in Art and in PE too. But I'm sick of them feeling sorry for me and treating me like a retard. Also, next week is culture week. They're going to make a mural of Vane and they want to use me as a model. And I fancy doing that like I fancy eating poo out of a dirty sock. Well, anything can happen between now and next week. How about one of these? I bet you want one of these. In Vega Baja Bakeries you'll find all of these and much more. Vero. Remember what I told you about Julio who was in space with aliens? He's here. We can talk to him and he can reply using this man's voice. He's called José María. Okay? He needs to talk to you. It's very important. I can't be with you. I'll be waiting for you here. I'm starting up. I'm starting up. I'm starting up. An entrepreneur of the future needs a modern legal advisory service. The legal advisory group Future Century offers tax, accounting and legal advice services. Future Century sponsors I'm Starting Out. My name is F.J. Carrasco and I'm the author of Ancestral Wisdom for Entrepreneurs, a manual that gathers ancestral knowledge and applies it to the business world. At the dawn of humanity, there were enterprises, business deals, managed assets, carried out market studies, and general accounting plans. Even before Homo Sapiens appeared, there was a business culture on our young planet. This book enables business people, big or small, or potential entrepreneurs, to learn about and delve into this ancient source of wisdom, and use it in today's world. I've compiled this knowledge to help today's entrepreneurs. We know that if they win, we all do. If the entrepreneur is successful, we are all successful. If may seem naïve or utopian, but I wrote this book to create a better world. Actually, I'd like to say that this book was revealed to me. Sometimes, while typing, I noticed that my fingers moved by themselves. I was not in control of the words on the screen. There were times, like in the chapters on outsourcing and intelligent networking, when I felt that I was simply transmitting knowledge. I would almost say that Ancestral Wisdom for Entrepreneurs is a book of spells for entrepreneurs of the 21st century. Let's think about the words we use. What does "ancestral" mean? Something ancient. But it is also something that lives on. Stones remain, the ground we walk on remains, the same ground our ancestors walked on. We must recover what is ancestral as a source of true knowledge. Vero. It may seem like nothing happened, but you've become very important. Look, a spirit has existed for a thousand centuries. When the sun shines, don't you see things floating in the air? Dust. It's the spirit. It looks for someone born under special circumstances, like you and your sister. Julio told me in secret so I'd help him. I was taking care of Vane while he prepared her. But they've taken her and you're the new chosen one. Julio blessed you with prayers the aliens taught him. Now the spirit can go into you and take on its true form. Will I turn into this? Yes. But first, we need to invoke the spirit. It's a lovely ceremony, but very complicated. It can only be performed tomorrow night, because time will be different. When it's inside you, everyone's life will change for the better. That scares some people, they want to prevent it. They're a very ancient secret sect. Anyone can be one of them. They found where we hid Vane and took her away. Will they come for me? Yes, but Julio will take you to a safe place until your transformation. He didn't tell me where, so I won't tell even if I'm tortured. Will it hurt when I change? A little bit to begin with, then you'll be fine forever more. You'll be eternal and able to do whatever you want. Will I be able to get Vane back and take her to Mommy again? I'm sure you will. Your gaze will be everywhere. Vero. Since one of the stages of humanity's history ends today, fancy doing anything special? Okay. … Elche football club, and the ball's gone over the side-line.

Even if nothing happens tonight, everything will be different after today. I've been reading up on UFOs for some time and studying statistics. Wednesday is the day when there are most sightings. And usually, the witness is driving in a non-urban setting between 12am and 3am. Okay, so every Wednesday night I take my car and drive along a country road, hoping… hoping it happens. It's what I want most in life. Hoping it happens. And relying on you guys has been so important to me. I had some hard times because of this. Sometimes I've felt alone.
