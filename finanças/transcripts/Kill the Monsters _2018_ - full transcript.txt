[effect plays] [glass breaks] [classical music] - No, they're still there. I'm telling you, it's a fuckin' funhouse. I'm subjected to defendin' myself. Well, someone needs to say to them, you know what, did you make a mistake of buyin' a home you couldn't afford and now you're broke? And you want me to give back the money I was promised, my bonus for doin' my job? I mean I care. What? What kind of knickers? What color are they? And the bra? Oh send me a picture, I hate using my imagination. What's that? Oh Sara you cow, I can't come back to London. Not yet anyway. You know that. Christ, I hate Americans. [dramatic orchestral music] - Christ Frankie, what are you, a coal miner? - Sorry. - You hungry? You want to know what time your boyfriend got home today? - No, don't tell him. - I'm telling him. He never left the apartment. Can you believe it? I want that job. I gotta stare at computer screens in coffee shops. That bank busts Frankie's balls. 10 o'clock and no overtime, is that even legal? He's an assistant for Christ sake. - I was a slave to my books. - Yeah, well there's an idea. I bet Frankie wouldn't mind slaving around all day with a book and a latte. - I don't like lattes. - He doesn't drink lattes. - Orange juice, whatever, you know what I mean. And you know what, I'm not living with this one much longer if he's not working. Pretty soon he's gonna watch game shows all day. - That sounds kind of fun. - I don't know, maybe, I mean... - See, don't encourage him. It's like gluttony on steroids. - All right, all right all right. - What were you visiting on your way home today? - Yeah, Saint Paul's chapel. - That's it? You pass that every day. Did you go inside? I told you to look at more places. What happened to that? - I was working. - You know there's a lot to learn and see, it's important to take advantage of. - Is the chicken cold? - No, sorry. [laughs] - You're not eating the chicken? - No, it's good, I like it. - What's the matter with you? It's good chicken. - It's just, it's too much. - Oh, I bought a jello mold for after dinner. - You made a jello mold? What the hell for, do they do that where you're from? - Not where I'm from. - I'm not eating jello mold. - Well I didn't buy it for you. - Well Frankie doesn't eat jello mold either. How chin ups you do on the bar in the hallway last night? - 50. - Without stopping? - 29. - See? Eat your chicken. You can't do pull ups without hormone-free chicken. Fawn to counter. - Can I just eat the meatballs, please? - If he eats the chicken, will you shut up about it? - Well I won't be there. - Frankie, eat your chicken. - I'm gonna throw some chicken in a sec. - Go ahead, I love civil disobedience. - Stop it. - Patrick, just uh, quickly. [romantic orchestral music] - Okay, just relax. Oh. [laughs] There, that better? - Does he need to see Dr. Reingold? [vomits] - Not so good, kid. - [Sutton] You need to quit your job. - Yeah, and do what? - What do you want to be a slave to a British banker for anyway? - The doctor says that you need to make changes or things are gonna get worse. - Yeah, the doctor doesn't even know what's wrong with me. - It's the shitty boss that's making you sicker is the bottom line. You're better off working for yourself somehow. - You can't stay dependent on a company that cares nothing for you. They make decisions that affect your well-being, you don't have any say. - But we need money, right? - Look, we have my trust. Patrick is making a lot from his blog right now. We will be fine, you can work when you're well. Start your own company or something. Just do whatever it is that you want to do. - I can't start-- - [Patrick] We do not need this. - Look, Patrick and I are only happy if you're happy. And you are not happy right now. You know, this thing that we're doing here? The three of us? I really believe that it is the only way. - I know. - And it won't work if we're dependent on any one else. [slow dramatic orchestral music] - Follow me. Call Juanita, tell she needs to clean on Monday, not Tuesday, out by four. Reschedule my chiropractor for the 13th. Also on the 15th I have to fly to Chicago by six. Oh and it's my sister's birthday on the 14th. See if you can find a scarf or something seemingly expensive. I had a dream the other night. I had to urinate. In searching for a pot, I found several. Some were old, with a chord or a lever. Others were new, with buttons, a bidet. The seats, they were covered in cellophane. So that if I got on with it, I'd wet myself. Rather than settling for the disappointment of one, I tested them all. And as I was toweling myself off afterwards, I saw the one from my childhood home. Alone in the corner. No cellophane, waiting. The bank is cutting costs, I'm sure you're aware. You'll get a 10% dock in pay. - I quit. - [Woman] What? - I quit. [dramatic orchestral music] - [Patrick] Sutton come on, let's go! Where should we go today? It's your day, we'll do whatever you want. - [Sutton] We could go to the zoo. - [Patrick] Frankie, you want to do that? Let's go to the Bronx. - [Frankie] I want to go west. - [Patrick] West where? - [Sutton] You mean the high line? - [Frankie] No I mean we can go to the zoo, that's fine. I mean I want us to move. - [Frankie] You want what? - [Frankie] I want us to move west. - [Sutton] You mean like Ho-bul-can? - [Frankie] No, I mean like California, or San Francisco, or like Portland or something. I think it'd be good, you know? Like change, like quitting the bank. - [Patrick] Are you out of your mind? We're not doing that. You're not well enough to do that. I'm not doin' that. You just quit your job! We were gonna go to the zoo, we were gonna look at a goddamn seal, not move across country. - [Frankie] The doctor said change would be good for me, so I think we should go. - [Patrick] I can't leave the city, I'll be a fish out of water. That's it, I'm going back to the apartment. - [Sutton] Okay, wait a minute. Jesus! - It's a stupid idea. - Maybe. - An irresponsible idea. - You wanted him to be more independent. - [Patrick] He doesn't have the wherewithal to make decisions like that. He's too young, he didn't go to college for Christ sake. He doesn't know what's best for him. - [Sutton] Oh, but you do? - [Patrick] More than him. - [Sutton] Well it's his life. - [Patrick] Our lives, it's our lives, Sutton. The decision affects us all. - [Sutton] Maybe, but it might be a good idea to expand. - [Patrick] No, I hate expanding. People leave the city when they don't know what they want or they fuck up and quit. - [Sutton] Or because they're looking for something more. Look, I am hesitant on the idea too, okay? - [Patrick] It's not good for us. - [Sutton] Well it might be good for him. And if it's good for him, then it's good-- - [Patrick] He doesn't own the apartment, we should be making the decision ourselves, we have all the money! - [Sutton] Well, then maybe we should let him buy into the apartment or something so that it's a little bit more fair. - [Patrick] What? [groans] How? - [Sutton] I don't know, but it makes sense, from his point of view. - [Patrick] I'm not doing it, you talk to him. - [Sutton] Oh, Christ. Let's just, he'll cool off. - [Frankie] I don't understand, are we supposed to just stay here the rest of our lives, 'cause that's what he wants? I mean is that what you want? - [Sutton] Look, I hear what you're saying-- - [Frankie] And haven't you wanted to go west? - [Sutton] Yes, I do. - [Frankie] I get that you're smarter than me, you're both smarter than me, I get it. - [Sutton] You are smart. - [Frankie] But I need to be listened to if we're going to stay together. I need to have a say in what we do. - And I'm not a fucking peasant. - Right. If he's not gonna listen to my ideas, if he's not gonna listen to my ideas, I'm not gonna support him, or listen to his advice. - [Woman] Two bedroom, two bath, newly renovated, three blocks from the Pacific. Owners are French, they're looking to unload. It's a goddamn steal, what they're asking. - Let me talk it over with Patrick. - [Woman] What the fuck is there to talk about? - [laughs] Jesus, okay, how much time do I have? - Look, I've been taking everything into account, and I think we should consolidate our debt. - Oh no no no no no, I am not consolidating. You and Frankie have so much more debt than I do! - Well I mean, are we in this together, or not? - Yes, yeah, but some things are just better left kept separate. - Oh I see, so if it's something I want, we should keep everything separate. - Oh my God. - If it's something you and Frankie want, suddenly it's majority ruled. I think we should consolidate our debt and then agree not to take on any more. That's what I think. - I'm not in the mood okay? So not today. - [Patrick] What's the matter with you? - [Frankie] The doctor increased my medication. - [Sutton] What? - [Frankie] My stomach hurts and all I wanna do is sleep. - I think we need to take him to see Dr. Reingold. Don't you think we should do that? - I bought us a condo in Santa Monica. - Wait, really? - Yeah. I've been doing some research, and there's a holistic doctor out there that I think would be really good for Frankie. - You bought an apartment in California, you didn't tell me? - Yeah, it's better that we get there sooner than later. - I thought we all had a say in what's best. This isn't me overreacting this time Sutton, you're on a rampage! He's sick and you're using it as an excuse to go on a goddamn rampage. - I'm not on a rampage! - Are you an escrow? - Hey Sutton can you please call the doctor, I really don't feel well. - [Woman] Dr. Davis, telephone please. Dr. Davis, telephone please. - Hey, I'm just going to take a listen, okay? - Okay. - You're fat now, a little. [laughs] - Please. - Gay man fat, I see you in your midsection. - You're just fuckin' with me. - So serious. - Alex you think that doctor in California is really gonna have the answer? - I dunno. That is not the point. You know, what you are doing here with them, it may be the answer to why it never works with two people. But to work, Frankie must be well. - You don't understand. - No? Okay, I don't understand. I'm just a doctor who works in prisons. Cough please, spread your cheeks. Is it cark, no? Okay, that is all. Who asked me to leave work and come here? Sutton? Is he here? No. Frankie? No, you did. You want to know what I think? I think you go, and everyone wins. Improvements and adventures. This is stagnation. - [Patrick] How is Louise? - [Alex] We are still getting over Carmine. - You think she'll ever try again? - Menage a trois? Who knows. - You know at first with Frankie, it was just sexual. Sutton and I aren't versatile, so it was nice to have someone for that. But then after a while, you know when we knew there was potential, it's nice to be needed. - And what about to need? You need him, hm? Well. [dramatic orchestral music] - [Patrick] Look, it was dumb of me not to let you have a say, I get that now. - [Frankie] You can't resent him? - [Sutton] I don't, you and Sutton matter more. Look there's one thing I need from you though. It's hypocritical of him not to agree, he's only thinking of himself. - [Frankie] What is it? - [Sutton] You manipulated him. - [Patrick] No, I asked, it's a compromise. The debt will go down faster if we're all paying it together. - [Sutton] That is not a compromise, no it's not a compromise, we talked about... [slow dramatic orchestral music] - [Patrick] Frankie, Sutton's making juice. You want one? - [Sutton] Does he want one? [slow orchestral music] - [Patrick] They gotta have some nuts or something at least that isn't processed. - [Frankie] I think there's a bathroom around the back. - Don't touch anything. - I won't. - Uh, there's no treadmill, by the way. - Well, get used to it. That's what we're in for out here. Look, I know I didn't get very far today, but I want you to see all the sights. You feel up for that, right? - Yeah. - 'Cause I'm torn. We got to get you to California for the doctor lady. Look I know we should have flown, but it's good to have new experiences. - Yeah, right. Oh, I'm starving. There's gotta be a diner around here or something. Maybe get some eggs. Huh Sutton, eggs? Sutton! Eggs! Guess you're not coming with us, huh? Are you ready? - [Frankie] I want a soda, do you guys want anything? - [Sutton] Yeah, nothing diet. - Patrick? - I'm fine. - [Sutton] What? - [Patrick] You brought a lot of drugs with you. - [Sutton] Yeah, well, road trip, you know? You know I was thinking that maybe I'd let Frankie try some. He was talking to me about the molly the other, and I don't know, I think maybe he might like it. - [Patrick] Uh huh. - [Sutton] What is wrong with you? You're acting funny. - [Patrick] I'm a little creeped out by all the drugs, is all. - [Sutton] What do you mean? - [Patrick] Well, you know I've never approved of it. - [Sutton] Yeah, I know, for you. - [Patrick] No, not just for me, not just for me. I never thought it was a particularly ingenious idea, but I was tolerating it, I've been tolerating it. You know I've been looking the other way, for the sake of the relationship. - [Sutton] Don't start, please. - [Patrick] You never would have agreed to getting together if I had said no to the drugs. - [Sutton] Yeah, I know. - [Patrick] I always thought it was some sort of youthful phase sort of thing, a gross, bad, dumb, you know, that would eventually fade out. And it wasn't worth throwing the whole relationship away. But now, what you're saying to me, you're telling me that instead of fading out the drugs, you want Frankie to do them too. Are you out of your fucking mind? So I don't think that's, you know, a good idea to have two crack addicts running around. Not to mention the fact that the whole reason we're headed west is to make Frankie well! - [Sutton] Oh this is completely unreasonable. I mean you've seen me, you've known that I smoke pot. This wasn't a surprise. And to the extent that you don't approve? I mean you've always been perfectly happy to look the other way in order to get what you want. So now you're telling me that you have a problem, I think you're trying to slam me to get the upper hand. - [Patrick] No. - [Sutton] And you tried drugs early on too, so don't act so innocent. [laughs] - [Patrick] Hardly, I didn't know what I was doing. I knew you would bring that up. - [Sutton] And Frankie wants to try something new, he's perfectly entitled to make up his mind on his own. - [Patrick] We're not expanding the drug use here, we're limiting it. [scoffs] - [Sutton] Wait, we're not limiting my use, huh? Is that what you're saying? - No. - [Sutton] Because that would be the next thing, to tell me what to do. - [Patrick] No, you do what you want. Just so Frankie's not inhaling a bunch of poison. If he thinks that's a good idea, then he's too fucking asinine to make decisions for himself. Pretty soon you'll want me to join in. - Controlling. - [Patrick] And we'll be one big crack family. No, I'm trying not to live on a crack farm. - [Sutton] I don't do crack! I don't inject anything! - Cocaine, whatever, you know what I mean. - [Sutton] Sick people smoke pot. I mean cancer, Jesus. And I mean, if Frankie joined in every now and then, maybe I would want to do it a little bit less. - [Patrick] That's ridiculous, where's the logic in that? - [Sutton] Well, we would only do it together. [laughs] - [Patrick] Yeah, all the fucking time! You're not doing it, don't get any ideas. - [Frankie] Is he mad at me or something? - [Sutton] It's nothing, it's fine, it's fine. Let's just go see Jefferson. [slow orchestral music] - I'm worried he didn't see where he's going. - No he's fine, trust me. I've known him a lot longer than you. He'll never leave us. I just think if you wanna try something, you should. I mean, you agree with that, right? - Right, yeah. - I mean I know that I like it maybe a little bit too much, and there are bad things about it, but it's still my right to do it. I mean I've always been this way, I'm not gonna change for him. - No, yeah. - So, do you think maybe you'd want to try some? - Uh, I don't know. - Because the more I think about it, the more I think that you should. I mean how else are you gonna know if it's for you unless you try it? [laughs] - Uh, right, I guess. - So I think you should try it. Look, I have some back at the motel. A shotgun, just to see. [coughs] - It kinda hurt. [laughs] - I'm sorry. [laughs] - I don't think I got any. - Well, you got a little. You can try it again. - Sorry. [laughs] That was a good one. - Yeah, you got it. That time you got it. - Oh, no. Jesus. [both laugh] Jesus, that's-- - Yeah, it's pretty good. - [Frankie] That's good, yeah. - And it's not bad for you, really, so. - [Frankie] Well that's good. - You'll see. [indistinct talking and laughing] Look, he promises that he'll only smoke pot on the weekends. That's good, right? Compromise, it'll be fine. [passionate moans and kissing] [dramatic orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music] - [Patrick] Christ. Frankie. Frankie? [sobbing] What I have to hold onto isn't a very ordinary dream. I was always knew complications were inevitable. You wouldn't know, wrapped up in your haze, but the past few days afforded me the time to think, you know? I'm sittin' there in the ER with Frankie, and the doctor's looking at me like I'm an idiot for letting my boyfriend carry on like this. And the whole time, instead of thinkin' about him, I'm thinkin' about us. So what's the answer? Is it that I sacrifice what I know to be right in order to maintain what worked well enough for so long? Not good for us, not good for Frankie. And, maybe, over time, if I'm lucky, you'll see the error. That, I'm ashamed to admit, I can live with. For now. For what I still believe is the greater good. You see what I'm saying? - I can't. - What do you want to do? - I'm gonna stay with you. - You can't have equal say only when it favors what you want, Sutton, the world doesn't work like that. [dramatic orchestral music] [passionate groans] - What's the matter? - What are we gonna do? The apartment in California is in Sutton's name. - I don't know yet, I haven't thought it through. You know I was thinking maybe when get to California, you should think about going to college. They got great schools out there. - Right. - Have you thought about that? Would you think about that? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You know you'll make better decisions if you think about things. - I think about things. - Maybe we'll agree more. Anyway I want you to get smarter. I'll pay for you to get smarter. Everyone should want to improve, think new things. - I was actually thinking about getting my real estate license. - Don't think that, what the hell for? - I can make a ton of money in real estate. - Well yeah, but... - I know college sounds good right now, but I'm not gettin' younger, and Sutton says I should focus on making money, making something of myself, and then I can go back to school if I want to later. - Right. - So. - Here, eat mine. - Are you sure? Hey. Hey, want more? There you go. There you go. Oh, get it! - [Patrick] Have you heard from Sutton? - [Frankie] No, why, what happened? Did you hear from him? - [Patrick] No. I called his mother. - [Frankie] Why? - [Patrick] I had his money frozen. - [Frankie] Jesus, what? - [Patrick] I mean I convinced her. I told her what was happening and she froze his trust so he wouldn't buy any more drugs. She hates me, the mother. She wouldn't take my call at first. - [Frankie] Why does she hate you? - [Patrick] We have different values, let's just say. But I thought if I explained what was happening-- - [Frankie] Do you think that's actually a good idea though? Because like what happens if he's gotta buy anything. - I had to do something. - [Frankie] He's got to go anywhere, what happens to the property? - [Patrick] Look, if he quits it with the drugs, she'll unfreeze the money. - [Frankie] Yeah, but-- - [Patrick] It's gotta work. I can't let him prove what we were doing is some absurd failed thing, but he's gotta hit rock bottom, he's sick right now. - [Frankie] You're right. - [Patrick] Look, I sent him a text, we'll wait for him at the motel. - Okay. He wants to talk to you. [moody orchestral music] - [Frankie] No, not again, seriously. ♪ When Sutton comes marching home again ♪ ♪ Hurrah, hurrah ♪ We'll give him a hearty welcome then ♪ ♪ Hurrah, hurrah ♪ The men will cheer and the boys will shout ♪ ♪ The ladies they will all jump out ♪ ♪ And we'll all feel gay ♪ When Sutton comes marching home ♪ Right, Sutton? - You're such a bad singer. - I know. - Like, really, it's really bad. - Well I got the words right. - I don't care about that. [dramatic orchestral music] - Jesus. Yeah? Sutton, open the goddamn door. - What? - Give it to me. Wanna move on, are we gonna move on? Or are you gonna be stuck in time? Edith called. - Did she make an offer? - No. - Well what's the offer? - [Patrick] I don't know. - You've already made up your mind, haven't you? - [Patrick] Haven't you? Look, she wants to see both of us. What do I have to do to get you to compromise? Don't push too far, it's not open season. - I want you to stop policing me. - No hardcore drugs. - Fine. - Fine. I'm sick of policing you anyway. - [Frankie] I don't understand why we're going back. - [Sutton] We need to go see Edith. - Who's Edith? - [Sutton] She's our cousin. - [Frankie] Wait, who's cousin, yours? - No no no, she's both of ours, Patrick and mine. Don't worry, we're not related. She's related to both of us though on either side. - [Frankie] Jesus. - [Sutton] We found out after we met. - Wait so why are we seeing Edith? - [Sutton] Business. [dramatic orchestral music] - Here kid, new iPhone, welcome present. - [Frankie] Thanks! - I finally get a chance to meet the cocksucker everybody been tellin' me about. Isn't he cute? Can he do anything for me? - Not really. - What about day labor? - She's kidding. - What? How you know he doesn't want to slaughter cattle? Did you ask him? Don't worry kid, I'm just fuckin' wit you. Have another drink, Sutton's paying. - Great. - Can you believe I'm related to these bottoms? - We're not bottoms. - Neither one of us is a bottom. - Like incest almost. - No nothing like that actually. - Frankie wanna take the key and go lie down? You look like shit. - What's the matter with him? - He's not well. - He's sick. - Like cancer or somethin'? - No, nothing like that. - Then what? - Like an ailment. - A general feel of malaise. - The fuck's that? Business is booming, but I got bastards back east bringing me down. Accusations about health code violations, contaminated beef. Undocumented workers. Tax code, labor law. - You're gonna look us in the eye and say that it's not true? - We're making money, baby, so much money. That's why I need a good PR, and you get your liberal lips to pipe people down, and you talk to your relatives. I don't want none of that anti-trust horseshit from the government. - What do we get? - Money. So what do you say? - How long do we have to stay here? - We have to get Frankie to a doctor's in California. - Well get him on a plane. - We can't. - Why the hell not? - He won't go without us. - [scoffs] Are you fucking kidding me? Then you take him, huh? What the hell is wrong with the two of you? This is business. - Look Edith-- - Improve your own goddamn lives, else you won't be good to anybody. Oh, I'm sorry, am I gonna have to fist you in your fuckin' vaginas? Take the goddamn money. - We're gonna stay here a few weeks. - Wait, what for? - Just a few weeks, it'll be fine. Need the money. - I didn't know. [dramatic orchestral music] [vomits] [coughing] - What's another word for restitution? I don't want to use surrender. Sutton? - What's that? - [Frankie] Edith says stocks will be up by the end of the quarter. Do you think we should diversify more? - [Sutton] I mean it's been a while and we are doing really well. I just don't think that we should mess with things. - [Patrick] Right. When do we close on the ridiculous house in Santa Barbara that you wanted? - [Sutton] Wednesday. I think that it's not ridiculous. - [Patrick] It's a goddamn vogue castle, not at all classy like the ranch in Palm Springs. - Oh we will be exhausted just traveling between the two. - [Patrick] I know. - By the way those new credit cards came in the other day. - [Patrick] Oh great, where did you leave them? I wanna buy some things. - Where's Frankie? Edith was indicted. - [Patrick] What for? - Insider trading. Securities and wire fraud. Making false statements to a grand jury. - [Patrick] Are we gonna lose a lot? - I need to get out of here for a little bit. - What are you talking about? You can't leave now. - Things will get better for us if we take some time apart, I think. - I'm not doing that, leaving him! Look. We lost most of our money, and property, except for the apartment in Santa Monica. - You promised we'd be in California by now. We're still in this fucking shit hole. I don't understand what you're doing. I don't think it's good money, I don't think you're helping anybody. You're not mopping floors or faxing shit, it's fucking reckless. You fucked up, and as soon as the doctors give me the go ahead, I'm going straight to California, and I'm never setting foot in another fucking hospital. Why are we spending all this money on shit, just because we can? [dramatic orchestral music] [door opens] [door closes] - Oh we have the three bottles of pino from the wine casing. - No, I have applications. - He has applications, he can't drink. - [Sutton] Well we can have a glass of something. - Hello. - [Sutton] Oh hi! - You live... - Oh yeah, just down there. And you're... - Right down the hall. - No way. - Oh wow. I'm Sutton. - Leni, this is my wife Gutrune. - Hi Gutrune, this is my partner Patrick, and my other partner Frankie. - Hi, hi. - Nice to meet you. - [Sutton] So you guys headed out? - We're headed out, ya, we have work. - Oh no. - Work, on a Friday night. - Well, party, work. - Sure. - Oh. What do you guys do, are you involved in the nightlife? - We are in real estate lately, I guess you would say. Und then after we are going for dinner somewhere, I'm sure. - Well would you like to just join us? - Yeah no, we've got tons of food. - Oh no, no, not tonight. But perhaps you would like to join us sometime in our place? Maybe Sunday, perhaps? - Do we have-- - No no no, that would be great. - For food und poker! - Poker? - Ya. - German poker. - Ya, it's the best kind! Und there's a Russian couple living upstairs, Nadja and Olga, und they might join. - Yeah, sure, well why not? - I don't know. - I kind of like them. - Yeah, right. - Frankie? - No, I thought they were really cool. - A little much. - No, they're just lesbians. I mean, German, it'd be nice. - Well I don't think we should be socializing with the neighbors. - Why not? - I don't know, it never ends well. We've got a lot going on here. Frankie has his college applications. - They are killing me. - They're killing him. - Oh, right, right right right. - The one, the more assertive one, she looks like she shoves the other one around. You noticed how she never says anything? - Well sometimes a relationship can be like that. - Domestic violence or something. - Oh, please! - I don't know. - You know, maybe we could be a good influence here. You know, show them how good a threesome can be. - Hey, yeah. - Do we know any single lesbians? - Just because a threesome works for us doesn't mean it works so well for some nutso German ladies. And the Russians down the hall are coming? What is this, the UN. - [laughs] No I think Sutton actually has a point. I mean, we always said we're trying new stuff, and it's really working now, so I think we could you know encourage other people to do the same. 'Cause it's working and we can tell them about the perks. - Why? - Because what we're doing is the right idea. - [Frankie] What? - I don't know, it's a little arrogant. - What do you mean? - It's working. - You know there's a difference between a well-wisher, being a well-wisher of the threesome idea, if you know somebody asks, and going around looking for couples to fuck with, trying to tell other people their business. - That's not what he means. [dramatic orchestral music] - You have a really big grill. - In Germany, everything is big. - In Russia too. - Well then we're gonna have to go to Germany. - Ya, you should. - Patrick is very fond of big things. - He's kidding, he's kidding. - No, yeah, I'm kidding. They know I'm kidding. - So you're in, what is it, open relationship? - Oh no, we don't. No, we're actually very happy. When it was just Patrick and me we weren't, really. And then, you know, since then, it's been really great. I mean it's the first time for any of us that a long term relationship has worked, really. And I think it's more of a, you know, higher state of being, you know? A more elevated state, or at least, something that we should all be striving for. You know? And we make all of our decisions equally. - I see. - And that-- - Frankie. You want to help Gutrune set the table? - Do you want to come help too? - I mean in a relationship, it's usually just one person calling the shots, or you know, wearing the pants, or whatever you want to call it in your case. But in our case, we really make all of the decisions together. - Gutrune prefers I call the shots. - Oh, well. At least you know that. - Ya. - You have it established. - I call the shots, but Olga and I like to share everything equally. - Oh, wow. These are done, I mean, you have never had a hamburger recipe like this. I am telling you, it's a secret American recipe. [chuckles] No sauerkraut though, or borscht. [laughs] Borsh, ke-bor, how do you say it? - Borscht. - Borscht. - Borscht. - Borscht. - Borscht, okay. [laughs] Great, well, thank you. Thank you for letting us come into your kitchen and take it over. I just really wanted to show you what a dinner could-- - Ya, Americans like to show. - Watch out boys, Nadja's gonna blow. - Eights. - Eights, Nadja! [laughs] Gutrune, pull the money from over there, I can't reach. - I need coffee. - Nadja, please, bitte! We only have wine here at this hour. Wine. Gutrune, get Nadja some more wine. Ya, a little more for the whole table. We need to loosen our American friends, they're playing so careful. - We're losing. - But really, a few pennies here und there. As you say, here und there. Not that wine, Gutrune. Not that one, Gutrune, the other one! The one that's... [speaks angrily in German] Well, we are doing quite well, exceeding expectations. - What do you mean, expectations? - Leni has dragged most pots. - Und yet you keep playing. - We are the only ones left. - Almost. There's still a few units here und there. The boys for example. - Sorry, I'm just a little bit, I don't understand. - They have played most of the owners in the building and won. - Won what? - The units! - Wait, did, for the, really? - Yeah of course, why not? - Are you kicking them out? - No. Well, some. Most pay rent, the ones we don't evict. - Extreme rent increases. - Get your elbows off the table Gutrune, please! So rude. - We used to join with them to beat the others, but not anymore. - Not anymore! - So you lose a lot. Why do you keep playing? - Pride. - I see you. Und raise you. 2,000. Are you unveiling? Are you able? I will of course understand if you are unable. - I am able. - Then what's the problem, hm? We are waiting, the boys are bored. They are shpectators. They want to go home and watch YouTube, if you don't make your move. - I will move. - Soon? [speaks in Russian] - Okay, we are ready, ya? - I would say. - I would say here we go. Three aces, und you? Two twos? Nadja, so crazy, can you believe! Okay, so that makes 2,000 from Nadja tonight so far, and 200 from hamburger und his helpers. A little wound, but not too sharp. Gutrune, you know what I think? I am beginning to think that the boys are just that. Boys. Not men. [laughs] Oh well. - Let's go again. - I'll see your 100, Patrick meine friend, und raise you 2,000. - We don't have cash like that on hand. - I see. Well what about your parking spot? You have one, right? In the building, spot 22? What do you say? Where's the harm, it's not your home! You can park on the street if you lose. Get a permit, no big deal, as they say. - All right. - All right! Nadja? - Fold. - Really? Nadja fold, so crazy. - We fold. - Is that true? - Yeah, we fold. - You take stock? - Why not, we take everything else. - Hold these. - Let him do it. - 5,000. - You are bluffing. Well? Well, three queens! [laughs] So appropriate, so true! Ya, how terrible for you. Gutrune, make sure you get a note for the stock. Don't lose it, Gutrune. If you do I will be in a very bad mood. You see I find it so amusing that you boys arrive, relatively new to the scene, und you tell Gutrune and myself and even Nadja und Olga und who knows who else you spoke to that your polygamous way is not only the best way, but the one and only way, und at the root of this way, is some notion of what is fair to do. Yet from the moment you have walked in here, you have done nothing but push poor little Frankie around like the garden maid. It's very confusing. Had you listened to him you might still have a parking spot. [chuckles] But, what is true is that you are no more equal to each other than Olga and Gutrune are to Nadja and myself. The only difference is we are just a little more obvious about it. I call the shots, remember? So? Want to go again? What about your apartment? I'm afraid you're still a little short. How about ownership of your blog, hm? Gutrune, can you believe? We are willing to put all the units on the line, but they would rather lose most than gain everything. - If we throw our unit in, will you split the earnings with us? - Yes. - I don't want to live here if this bitch runs the joint. - So, here we go. Flush! You see, I win again! - Yes! Yes! - What are you doing, what are you doing? What is he doing? You can't give apartment back, she doesn't deserve it! - We'll handle giving back the units on the first five floors. You handle giving back the rest. - We're not giving back. - What do you mean? - We're taking over as landlord. - Wait, you're kicking them out? - Not kicking out, but we won. - Wait a minute, how is this any better than the Germans? - I'd worry about your half. There are lots of thing. - I should've kept the Russians out of it. - Well, we needed them. - We at least made a ton of money. - Mm, yeah. [dramatic orchestral music] - [Doctor] It's looking good, kid. - Oh, fuck. [light guitar music] - Katrina wants to have us over on the 15th to meet her new girl friends. - I'll make sure I put that in my calendar. - I had a shit day, you know. Just dreadful, with the blog. But thank God I have it. It keeps me mentally active. Critical thinking, you know. It's important to stay critical. Is the 15th good for you, Frankie? You gonna be able to fit it in, what with your busy schedule? - Mm-hm. - [Patrick] You know you've been spending a lot of time in front of the TV lately. You think that's a good idea? - Leave him alone. - Indolence is never an attractive quality. - It isn't indolence. - I've spent the last six months gardening and building furniture like the desk you like so much, so. - Yeah, let him have a break if he wants it. - You want to watch this shit? - Yeah, sometimes. - Sutton stop it, don't pretend. - What difference does it make? He's going to school, he's active. - He's wasting time wasting his life on nothing, this is nothing. - What do you want from him? - More than nothing. - You live upstairs? - Yes, I live upstairs. - Right, I'm Sutton, and this is my partner Patrick. - Hey. - Hello, I'm Sajida. - Our other partner is on the sofa being a lug, he's a bit lazy. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes. - Or some jello mold? We have leftovers. - Not really. We need your help. - How? - I'm sure you're aware of the battle we're having with the neighbors next door. - The Iranians? - They play loud music to all ends of the night. It's very difficult for my wife to sleep. - You have a wife, who is your wife? - Raja. - I didn't even know that you had a wife. - Well, okay-- - I mean I've never seen her before. - Okay, well yes-- - Isn't she a doctor or something? - No. Anyway, that is not the point. The point is that I think that they're trying to drive us from the apartment. - Oh? - So they can knock down the walls and make it one unit. - That's awful. - Tell me about it. - I can't believe that. - And well everyone knows that you're doing quite well, so I was wondering if you could consider loaning us some money to soundproof the apartment. - Can you really soundproof an apartment entirely? - Well additional installation. We'd pay you back, of course. - Right, well, um-- - I'm sure you're aware of how much instability there is in the building, and well, I don't know if you're heard, but Nadja is finding it hard to manage the units they took over. - Oh. - She might lose them. Even still, she offered to loan us the money, but well, I wanted to approach you first. - Uh-huh. - I don't think it's a good idea that Nadja has so much control over the building, you know? - No, of course not, we don't either. - And we need this. We need your help. We also have fresh vegetables growing on our balcony. Kale and whatnot. My wife says they're better than the farmer's market. Take as much as you want. - You know. - I know. - Frankie's doctor said... - Frankie's doctor said that his health is dependent on him eating organic vegetables. - What is the matter with him? - He's sick. - He's not well. - Is it cancer? - No. - Well than what, I don't understand. - It's more of a feeling, a malaise. - The fuck is that? - It just means that he needs to eat healthy food. - Well there you go! We have more than enough. What a trade. So? - You know, Sajida, I just want to say, I really want to emphasize that the best thing that happened to Patrick and me is Frankie. And the best advice that I can give to you is to get a second wife. Now I know it's not what you're used to or what you came here wanting, but a polyamorous relationship like ours has it's benefits. You make a lot more money. It's better to make decisions that way. Now, I will talk this over with Patrick, and we'll mention it to Frankie, but I really hate what your neighbors are doing just like we hate knowing that Nadja is in control of so much of the building. But this idea of a three way relationship, I really think that you should think about it. Would you be willing to think about that? - [Patrick] What the hell was that? - [Sutton] I've been thinking about it, I've been thinking that we never see anyone from the top floors. They never come to any of the parties. - [Patrick] That doesn't mean-- - [Sutton] We need to be a little bit more realistic about our situation. We live in a crowded building where half of the apartments are hostile towards us. I think it's a good idea to send a message of generosity and then we have one more neighbor who likes us. And I think that she really took to my idea of getting a third person in her relationship. I mean I think it would solve a lot of their problems. - [Patrick] Yeah, I don't think she took to it. - [Sutton] Well why wouldn't she take to it? - Well I said not everyone thinks it's such a good idea. - [Sutton] Well you think it's a good idea. - Well yeah I know, but for us, not everyone's like us. I don't know why it's so important for you to do what we do. We've had this conversation before. - [Sutton] Can we just give them the money? Let's just give them the money. I mean if we don't, then things are just gonna get worse between Sajida and the Iranians, and we're gonna have more of Nadja's shit to deal with. If we say no and Nadja gives them the money, then they'll resent us for it. I mean Frankie wants to do this. - [Patrick] Frankie's watching reruns, he doesn't give a shit about this. - [Sutton] Frankie! - [Frankie] Yeah? - [Sutton] Should we give the Iraqis some money to soundproof their apartment? Frankie? - What? - [Sutton] Should we give the Iraqis some money? - 'Kay. - See? - Fine. [dramatic orchestral music] [water trickling] [cartoon music] [dramatic orchestral music] - I saw this one pasty girl with like stringy red hair. And the guy is like, "Can we shave your head?" And then they take her hair and this like big ball of butter you know and they mash the butter and her hair together. And she's gotta eat it. And so she eats it, she gets like a certain amount of money or something. The whole time she's eating it, she's like, she's like gagging and struggling and like puking it right back up. But guess how much she did it for? - [Sutton] How much? - 20 bucks! - That's it? - I know, people are so fuckin' stupid. They'd had to give me like 20,000 at least to do something like that. - [Sutton] Well maybe she just wanted to be on TV. - God, that show is so good. That channel has the fuckin' best shows. - How's school? - I don't know. - Have you thought about dropping out maybe and getting your real estate license, or getting a job now so that you can make some money? Don't you think that'd be a good idea? - [Frankie] Actually maybe. - I mean you gotta do what you want to do so that you can be happy. - [Frankie] Right. - If we've learned anything from this, it's to listen to what you want more, and I think the universe is trying to tell us something by giving you the idea to come out here. - [Frankie] Yeah, I think so too. Oh the bathroom ceiling is actually leaking. Tried to brush my teeth this morning, water kept dripping on my head. - You think she's flooding the bathroom? - [Frankie] Who? - Sajida. - [Frankie] The Iraqis, really? - Well, they live right above us. - [Frankie] Yeah, but why would they want to do that? We do a lot for them. - You wanna do something about it? - [Frankie] Well, can we do something about it? - We could sue. And then if we won damages and they didn't pay us, we could get the condo repossessed. - [Frankie] Well, will they even pay us, anyway? - I know, they probably wouldn't. So then the condo board would own it and then rent it out. - [Frankie] That would take forever, right? - To be honest, I met a few other Iraqi women that are in a three way relationship like us, and I think they'd do something nice with the place. - [Frankie] No, I don't want to buy a condo or something stupid. - No, no no no no. - [Frankie] And I don't like that we even own these units in the first place. - No, I'd be fine with them owning it eventually, and they seem like nicer women. - [Frankie] Okay, yeah. - Great, I'll get the process started. Oh and I've been thinking that it might not be such a bad idea if stop putting as much money into our joint bank accounts and then more into our individual ones. That way we can get our own groceries too. I mean we could go shop at Smart Mart instead of Fresh Foods all the time. ♪ You can buy Twinkertots at Smart Mart ♪ [laughs] - [Patrick] I'm on a deadline, but I know we need to talk about the bathroom. Let me just finish this first. - Hey, I'm gonna head to Smart Mart in a sec. Do you want anything? - What are you talking about? - [Frankie] I'm gonna buy me some Twinkertots. - Twinkertots? - [Frankie] Yeah, I love 'em. - Those are nothing but sugar. Are you out of your mind? - [Frankie] Well Sutton says he thinks we should all buy our own groceries, we don't have to agree. And I can eat whatever the hell I want. - You're not gonna eat that shit. - [Frankie] I think it's a great idea. - Well, then you're ridiculous. You're siding with Sutton on something that's going to make you sick. What the fuck did you say to him? - We're evicting the Iraqis for flooding the bathroom. - [Cathy] People are begging me. Cathy, please, please, Cathy. You have the most successful reality TV show of all time, okay? - What is this? - [Sutton] Preliminary letter we need to legally deliver to the Iraqis. Just stick it under the door when you have the chance. - Fuck. - [Woman] What the [talking in foreign language] think they can get away with anything just because they have more money than the rest of us? [yelling in foreign language] I never flooded anything! They're the ones flooding people's heads with lies. Fear. They cooked this up and the craven bastards on the board sold the lie. They think we need a threesome? Try to tell me how to run my home? I'm coming down there. - This is... [doorbell ringing] - You had me out there for 10 minutes. - I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Here, just let me help you with that. - Be careful with my wrap. My son made my wrap for me. - All right. - Here kid. - What is that? - Coupons for your junk food and sodas that you like. - Oh sweet! - Also that store where you get your clothes from is having a final sale on those little workout shorts that you wear all the time. - Hey, thank you. How did you know I like all this stuff? - Well, I also made a list of TV shows and some porn sites that you might want to check out. Based on your interests. - Okay! Hey um, I'm almost out of snacks, got these coupons from her. Can I please have some money? - You need to learn how to budget better. I heard they're hiring down at Smart Mart. - Yeah I already have three part time jobs. - Well, maybe you can ask your parents for some money. - Right, yeah. Like they have money. It's not like we can all ask our parents for anyway, we don't all have a trust fund. - You know Sister Wives is starting, maybe you want to go live tweet about it? - [Frankie] I'm going. - Nadja's broke. She can't cover all of her mortgages. Barely holding her own. I think her and Olga are taking another wife, if you can believe that. - Jeez. - You need to nab these when they go. Beyond that, I have a list of a bunch of buildings that I think you boys ought to buy. We'll make a bundle when the bottle blows. - You want to buy distressed properties? - Buy the buildings dirt cheap. You do some cosmetic improvements that hide the underlying rot, and you trick suckers into snatching them in a final sales contract. - You want to commit fraud? - What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with him? I got to talk innocent to him, is that it? Oh, so you want me to lie to you so you can say you weren't there. We gonna do this or not? - [Sutton] We'll do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [Edith] He gonna go along with it? - He won't stop it. - I mean look, I just got acquitted. I need this. - I know. - What about Frankie? - Frankie's watching Frasier. - Fine. I'll fill it with some figures and finalize the fine print by Friday. [men laughing] [video game sounds] - Die, fucker. Yes! [burp] Fuck, my tooth. [groaning] I feel like shit. - [Woman] Telephone please, Dr. Davis, Telephone please. - Look first of all, I want to thank Frankie for allowing me to take the lead on making him well. I think we all got sidetracked from what's really important, it'll be nice to implement some changes I believe will make a big difference. At the same time Sutton I want to be real clear, it's important for us all to agree. I'm willing to make some compromises, because frankly otherwise the fighting will never end. So the first thing I think we should do is start buying our groceries again on the joint account. - No. - Okay, do you have another idea? - Yeah 'cause now that I'm on my own for expenses, I'm kind of having a hard time paying for food. I had to pick up another job at Smart Mart, and I don't even have time to watch Dance Palms anymore. - I mean it's not a good idea. We need to be able to choose where we shop. I mean don't you want to pick what you eat, or do you want Patrick in charge of what you stick in your mouth? - No, I'd like to choose, but-- - And another thing is Patrick, the Iraqis are leaving this weekend, I don't want to discuss letting them stay if that's what you're thinking. Bitch slapped Frankie. - She slapped me across the face. - Across the face, I want her out. - Which makes sense. - You aren't gonna fuck with the plan to buy the building are you? 'Cause if you are, I'm calling Edith. We'll make more money this way, and that's good for Frankie, and we need to keep making money. And since Edith is the only one with ideas on how to do that, I think that she should have an equal say in the decisions that we make. - Well, sorry I just don't really get that part, because she's not in the relationship with us, so-- - No no, more like a councilor. You don't need to worry, it'll be fine. Oh, by the way, we need the password to your iCloud account. - What for? - So that we can look at your photos and track your phone. - Uh, why do you want to track my phone? - So that we know where you are. - But-- - [Sutton] You want to be safe, right? - Uh, yeah. - [Sutton] Well right now, Edith is the only one with access. - Edith's been looking at my dick picks? - She has access, I don't know if she's been looking. - What does a lesbian want to look at my dick for and like track me and shit? - You wanted the phone, right? - Yeah. Well what about the drain clog? - [Sutton] What about it? - Last time Edith was here, she showered and clogged the drain, and it still hasn't been fixed. - I agree, that's terrible. - I'll call a plumber. - No, that's not a good idea. - Then what? - That's another thing, Patrick. You've been in charge of household repairs. And whenever you're in charge you say you're going to fix things and then they never get fixed. - It's true, they're not fixed. - Because you won't call the plumber! - Frankie doesn't want us wasting money on a plumber, and I don't even use that bathroom. What else you got? - You've got other ideas, right? - You all right? - No! I'm not, actually, I'm fuckin' pissed. You know what, now that I think about it, you need to stay out of my business. And give me some more independence for Christ sake. I can make my own choices, and you need to buy me more shit! I can't afford to deal with this on my own. I need medicine and doctors visits and my goddamn Twintertots. I mean is that so hard? I want you two to be positive, and all you are is negative! You never agree on anything, and Sutton you never want to do anything differently, and you always make some promise about some new fucking ideas about how to change things, but I don't know, to me it sounds a lot like things are gonna stay the same. And don't think I don't know that you're suing the Yemanese and her biker bitch girlfriend, and threatening the Sudanese on the third floor with the same fate, even though I specifically said I don't want us getting involved in other people's unit! And why, because you're Suda will fucking call you out? If they flood the bathroom again? I mean Jesus, let them, they're three floors below us! It's none of our goddamn business! And you know what's next I suppose is kicking out the Iranians, yeah? Who by the way are storing up all kinds of shit, jamming the fucking garbage shoot and other hazards, causing a fuck ton of dangers that neither of you two are doing anything about because you're too busy trying to get the same access to my phone that Edith apparently does instead of fucking trusting me. That's the fucking point of this! I mean, I don't know, I don't feel well, I want to lie down. [pots clanging] - Don't start. - You're a liar. [scoffs] You want one thing and you advocate another. You say you want everyone to decide for themselves and then you make big blundering decisions you want everyone to go along with. - That you go along with. - And I hate you for it. - You don't hate me. - Oh no? - You don't hate me. - Then what is it exactly that I hate? Why don't you tell me, just so I can have a general idea. - You're weak. - [Frankie] Oh hey, sorry, are you that clown from TV? - [Cathy] Yeah, hey kid. - [Frankie] Do you live here? - [Cathy] Oh yeah, too long. - [Frankie] I love your show, it's the best show ever. - [Cathy] Yeah, that right? Just wait, I've got a new show coming, it's gonna be even better. The best. - Cool. - [Cathy] Yeah, network is gonna give us some money to fix up the building, too. You know, redo the lobby and that. - [Frankie] Sweet. - [Cathy] We need new ways of doing things around here, otherwise shit never gets done. It's a complete fucking disaster. - [Frankie] Yeah, you tell me. - [Cathy] Hey, you got time for a soda? - [Frankie] Can I have ice cream in it? You know I was thinking that we should have somebody to like decide things for us. - [Sutton] You mean like an advisor? That's why we have Edith. - [Frankie] No no not like an advisor, like somebody who can really run stuff. - [Sutton] Like, what do you mean? - [Frankie] Think like Cathy down the hall. - [Sutton] The clown lady with the reality show? - [Frankie] Yeah, she's got a ton of money, I think she'd be really great at helping us manage ours. And she said if you wanted to keep more funds in your account you don't have to put it in the joint account. That's what you've always wanted, right? - Did you talk with her? - I'm gonna have way more money than you and Patrick soon, I don't want to be spreading it around. - She said that? - I just think it's lucky. I think it's lucky that we found someone from one of my favorite TV shows who wants to call the shots and wants to help us solve everything that we can't seem to right now. - You know I don't think that she'll-- - I'm tired of trusting Patrick. You know sometimes he can be a real drag. - Right. - I have some other ideas too. - Like what? - I think we need to get back to watching TV together instead of you guys reading books all the time and eat food like cookies and french fries. These neighbors don't need to come over for visits anymore. You know, like you said, they're gonna want to spend the night I bet, and eat all my Twinkertots and make a mess and not do any house work. - Did I say that? - You know, we're better off without them. Oh, by the way, I decided to drop out of school. You know like you said, who needs it. - You really want to take the risk of letting this crazy lady control things? - Whatever, I'm just sick of this. If it's not Cathy now, it's gonna be someone else eventually, because you guys can't figure it out. - Right. - [Frankie] So, you cool? - Well. - Those three Iraqi women moved in yesterday, they're already threatening to flood the entire floor, and what did I say? Did I not say? Very unstable. I won't consent to your scheme unless we implement some changes for safety or else this is getting out of control. - Fine. - I want to make sure I do what's best for Frankie. - [laughs] Right. - The hell is that supposed to mean? - Chumps and salesmen, that's what it is. Nice try sweet pea, but you do what's best for you. - You know what Edith-- - You ever look at that kid and think maybe this is it? Not that the opportunity isn't there, opportunity is irrelevant. He might want to, but he will never be you. You wouldn't want that anyway. No more good can be attempted than the kid can bear, and the kid can't bear any more good. Sutton accepts who he is. Who's he gonna go along with? - Look, I believe in what we're doing. - Or is it just that you've been doing it for so long, your beef ain't with them? [dramatic orchestral music] - Look, I already got Edith to consent to changes if we're gonna go along with buying those buildings. [toilet flushes] So see, we're making some real progress here. - Okay, this one's for you. So this one's jump, square and circle. - Jump is X. - And then punch, kick, and that's throw stuff. - Punch, kick, throw stuff. - And you hold these down for special moves, there's like fire and stuff too. Now you just get to pick whoever you want to be. - I want to be the red one. - I will be the lady one. - Oh, right. [laughs] This one is throw, right? - Yeah. - Okay, all right. - Prepare to die! - [Sutton] Okay, ready? [video game beeps] - Yes! Boom! - [Sutton] Oh oh oh oh oh! Boom. - [Frankie] Eat that, yep, yep! - [Sutton] Oh! [laughs] - [Frankie] There it is!
