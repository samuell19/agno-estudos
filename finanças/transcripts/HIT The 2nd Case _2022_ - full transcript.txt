What kind of scum are you, just because your wife didn't sleep with you, you beat her up mercilessly No. Please dont listen to her.. [Gasping] Do you get rights on a woman's body just because you married her? Husband behaved like an animal on wife's denial of sexual intentions. A married guy in Madhurawada- [Phone ringing] Hey, what's all this about you on the news channels? I thought you were a good man. I cancelled your contract and we assigned someone for that work Okay sir. Get it Max. Anand, one tea please Okay. Brother. - How are you? - I am good, sir. Hello!

Hello, give some tea to our media friends. Sir, the clues team is already working on it but they have not found any leads They won't. They killed him somewhere else and dumped his body here. Such a violent murder, in an open place like this... - Did you ID him? - Yes. There is a wallet. We have an ID in this. Have you informed his family? No Sir, we were waiting for your approval We will do it. - Hello. - Who is this? - Sir, I am KD, Vizag SP. - Tell me sir. I am sorry to tell you, that your brother has been murdered.

I asked you to come fast but I didn't tell you where to come. How did you come to the exact spot directly? Hold on to that expression Hey Man. Most satisfying part of my day. You suit so well in my gallery. TV! My relatives informed me after watching it live on TV We haven't given permission to telecast it Live I checked your brother's phone. There were 22 phone calls between you two. What was the issue last night? Forensics... spray Luminol - He is ready. - Okay. Show your hands. Why are you feeling shy? Show me. Aah, Brother's Blood. Nice title, isn't it? Do you think, you can escape just by washing your hands with phenyl. You bloody.... Cry now. Move... One question from TV5 One at a time Sir, whom are you arresting? How did you catch him in such a short time? If we catch them late, you say We are not doing our job well. If we catch them early, you ask us how can you catch them so easily? - What do you guys want? - We are just doing our duty. Look, to solve a case one doesn't have to work day and night, skip meals and sleep and be at the verge of almost dying to catch a criminal, as they show in movies. Generally these criminals are dumb. They are Bird-Brained. It takes only five minutes to catch them. Shall I leave now? Idiot! This guy has no respect for the press. Thanks man. Give me company. Let us have some tea That's okay sir. - Please sit brother. - It's ok sir. Ah, what up with the new ADGP? Did you get to know anything about him? Sir, He is a bit strict... Only you can set him right. We will do it. Do one thing, get me all the information about him in two days. What does he eat, where does he drinks, how many kids, how many wives, etc. - Okay? - Okay sir. Hello! sir... Okay, sir. He is asking me to come. - You drink tea. All OK? - Nice sir. Need to look smart to sir right? Hey, where are you going? Go. Welcome to Vizag sir. Happy to have you - What is your name? - KD, sir? Don't you have a full name? What is KD? Krishna Dev, sir. I heard that you have complete control over the department here, is it? Do one thing, in the next three days arrange for a... one-on-one interaction with the entire department. - Sure sir, but one thing! - What? Please look into the recruitments Sir. There is no one other than me in the SP Cadre here. What is the urgency? This city hardly witnesses any high-profile crimes. Correct but We can't afford to give rest to our goalkeeper just because the other team is weak. I heard it correctly! You do have a loose tongue. Sir! Varsha! I have been appointed as a subordinate to you. Sir, In what happened... -Attention Varsha! Look at me. I said look at me. There is only one unsolved case in my career. The reason behind that unsolved case is... your manipulative behaviour The mere sight of you annoys me. So, do me a favour and please leave. Sir! So to summarize... we all know about the problems faced by the weavers. Moreover the women in this field needs our help a lot. From my side, I have been creating designs... ...in my boutique only using the fabrics created by them. To implement such a model at a wider scale, we all need to come together. [Crowd applauding] I am happy to answer any questions. Can we plan according to members availability, madam? - Okay, it's getting late. You carry on. - Bye. Should I say sorry for being late? No need SP sir! You are great people. We have no option but to wait for people like you. Isn't it? Madam... You talk about feminism, equality. But we need to pay bills, pull chairs for you and open doors, isn't it! Not fair. I believe that men and women are equal. I don't argue that women are superior to men. It has nothing to do with me expecting chivalry from you, as a woman. Okay! So next time you are late, I will punish you. Lets go Hey Max. Thank you. Move in with me. What!? I want live with you It is a huge deal to live together before marriage. It's a big decision to take. - You ask me so suddenly- - See Arya. I don't know how to sweet-talk with you. All I want is to wake up next to you in the morning. Return back to you after working hours everyday When I am back from duty, you should be there watching your favourite TV show. And I should be massaging your feet. Come live with me, you will like it Within no time, we can form a cricket team. You. You and your sweet talks! I am serious. Okay, I will think about it. Sorry, Mom. I could not answer your call. I was busy with work. It is okay. How have you been? How was the day? Oh... Accent! You said, you will think about it. I have already thought about it. Welcome Home! "I have been waiting Did you rain on me!..." "I will lay as it is. Did you bring it with you? Something magical" "Calling you by touch even you are facing me.." "To know who you are." "Halted the running time and requested that, I want you." "You dance like a flowing river" "You are a boon to my life." "You came searching for my heart. And you belong here." "You dance like a flowing river" "You are a boon to my life." "You came searching. For my heart... oh my love." Dal and white wine Wine and dal? Yeah, it's good Give it a try.. trust me. "My soul is asking, Whether I belong to her." "Even beauty is jealous, Of us" "Erasing the boundaries between our lips and asking for a kiss" "The magic in your eyes finds out What is there in my heart…" "You dance like a flowing river" "You are a boon to my life." "You came searching for my heart. And you belong here." "You dance like a flowing river" "You are a boon to my life." "You came searching. For my heart... oh my love." Ramesh, you can leave. It's Ok ma'am... I will leave after you go You can leave, I am going to take some more time. Mom! With whose permission, are you living with my daughter? Please listen to me Aunty. With whose permission are you living with my daughter? - I asked her only aunty. Who else do I need to ask? Aunty! I will marry Arya for sure. I don't have any issues with marriage. But I have an issue with quarrels that come after marriage. Look at my parents. They have been fighting with each other from the day they got married. Now, at this age, they are planning abroad trips to nurture their love. I don't want that for us. I need to know whether Arya likes to live with me. That is why we are living togethter. - Do you understand what I am saying? - No, I don't. KD! - Abhi, what's up? - I'm in Vizag. Vizag! Does Hyderabad HIT need help again? I am at your office.. come -Okay wait, I'm coming. Max, get down. What? You are such a big police officer and still you don't know how to whistle. Like a PT master you are using that blow whistle. Such an insult! You go and talk to your mother. Sort our thing. I urgently need to learn how to whistle. I'll see you around. Hi... The file given to us by Nageswara Rao… -Move aside... Abhi! Hey KD How are you Man? Good to see you. What is this all dust, dude? Did you get beaten up? It’s a small issue at the shipyard. I need a favour. This is the phone of a prime suspect in the case. I need to crack it immediately. I don’t have the time to send this to Hyderabad forensics. Oh! You came to Vizag, already fought and now you are delegating work to me…! Surprising. Sir, you got a phone call. It’s about a case. Hey, let him in, we'll ask him later -Sir..Sir..Sir... Brother! How come you guys reach before us! that too with such a big gang. Between us...... Tell me the truth. You have a WhatsApp group right? - Did you have tea? - Yes. Wait here. Shraddha! What's the issue? You need to see this. Check that bite marks on the neck. Analyze that bite pattern. Finger tips had been cut off. Trophy? Is that pub stamp on her hand of this lounge? No, sir. See these shoe prints. Take a picture and send to the company. Find out the model number of the shoes. CCTV? Those were manipulated, KD. Not even one hard disk was found. They took away everything. Are you the owner? Yes, sir. - What's the name of that girl? - Sanjana sir. She has been working for me for last two years. Who was the last one to see her? Our bouncer named Ramesh, sir. When she was about to leave home after the lounge closed, she called me to inform me that she was leaving. - Where have you been at that time? - I was at my home, sir. Where do you stay? Close to this place sir, two minutes away - Did you kill Sanjana? - Sir! I didn't sir. I didn't sir. Ramesh! - From when have you been working here? - Last three years sir. What did you speak with Sanjana? I said that I will wait for her, to accompany her. She said ' I don't need your protection Ramesh' and ask me to leave. - Sir. Sir... - Sir. Sir... (Media people questioning about the murder) Did you find out who did it? No You are the one who should catch him right? Who will catch the criminals if you get emotional like this? Did you soak urad daal? You need to make dosas by 7AM, right? You write everything in your planner don't you? Good night! You are not sleeping here? No, I will sleep with mom. - Why? That's what is called respect KD. Okay. The body we found in the lounge yesterday is not only Sanjana's. - What? - Only the head belongs to Sanjana KD. Hands, limbs, and the torso belong to different women. Shit! In our analysis, all the girls are of age group 25 to 35 years, KD. - But- - We don't have information. - The bastard cut off the fingers. - Yes. Can we know when did the other women get murdered? In general, we can identify with the amount of rotting of the dead body. But these body parts were frozen by the killer. So technically speaking, they erased the time line of the murders. What other information do we have? Rape! Semen samples! There is no sign of rape. But, by analyzing the bite pattern on Sanjana's neck... We can assure you that the person who bit Sanjana's neck has an extra teeth on his front two teeth (incisors). See... this is that extra mark. Hyperdontia. - Did we find any DNA from that bite mark? - No. And we don't have any finger prints from the scene too. Shoe prints? We sent it to FILA company for analysis. We got to know that its an ankle length sneakers. For sure this is the model, but we can't tell what's the color. We also sent the pub stamp on her hand for analysis. We are yet to get the information on that, Kd. KD. I think we have a serial killer out there. So we are looking for a serial killer. Thats what you are telling! Sir, we just know two things about the killer. First one, his shoe size is 9. He wore ankle length Fila sneakers. Second, he has an extra teeth on his front teeth. Hyperdontia. We don't know how fast he is moving or killing. So we have to move quickly. It's not even been one month since I came here. And I have to deal with all these tensions! We don't even have officers in the SP cadre here. Such a high profile case..... We have Abhilash sir. But, but but.... Close this case as soon as possible. Sir. We will split the investigation into two parts. First one is Sanjana. As we know her identity its a straight forward investigation. Nobody should be here when I come back, understand? Second, the other three girls. We need to find their identities. Can we try investigating all missing cases in Vizag? Per year there are more than 5000 missing cases in AP alone. Without the time frame, we can't investigate that many cases. That's a foolish suggestion. Age group 25-35 and gender female. If we apply these two criteria, we can narrow down. That's why I suggested. you don't need to overreact. Abhi. See this torso area. Find out if there were any surgical implants or procedures performed on this person. There is no sign of any surgical implants or stents or procedures. Mr. Krishna Dev, it's very tough to understand the mindset of these serial killers. Until we see the world from their perspective we can't understand the justification for their behaviour. Rajitha. yeah! We are the officers investigating Sanjana's case. Come For the last three years, Sanjana and I have been sharing this place. As we cant afford twenty thousand rent- - We are paying the rent in halves. We don't talk much. Sir... Continue. We don't talk much. We don't involve in each other's business. As our timings are also different, We used to talk very less. She rarely stays in this house. May be she had other friends. But no one used to come here. Sir, that's my room. Oh really! You carry on. He is like that only. I rarely stay at home too. I come late at night from work. We don't even have any common friends. Just to afford the rent we are sharing the house. Rajitha, looks like you have a boyfriend! Yes sir. I saw him in your room. Very fair skinned. She doesn't have an extra tooth. Note down. We need to meet the Lounge owner - Karthik. - Sir. We checked your's and Sanjana's call records and message records. Sir, please...... I can't hear you. Please talk loud. What's happening Karthik? Mam, he has been trying to have an illicit affair with Sanjana. He invited her to his guest house for his second innings. He forced her despite her denying. What! What the fuck is wrong with you Karthik! - I can explain. - That's why you are not even coming home. Madam. Go home and fight. I am talking to you properly just because there is proof that you were home when the incident happened. - What about your family? - They live in Hyderabad madam. Did Sanjana's family come here regularly? Her father used to come sometimes. She used to go once every month. - Where? - She said a village name. Try to remember Where? Brother... how long? Just 5 minutes. Tikkavaanipalem. In busy pubs, to control the people who escape the entry fee, they change the pub stamps regularly right? Yes sir, in busy pubs they used to do that. when was the last time the stamp was changed in your pub? It happens in busy pubs sir, not our's. Sir, nobody here have extra tooth. Rajitha, please move to some other place for some time. This place is going to be busy with police department and forensic personnel. Who are they? They came for investigating Sanjana's case. Hi sir. - What's your name? - Kumar, sir. - Where do you stay? - Close by sir. Bhogapuram. What you do? I spend my dad's money sir. Varsha, take his complete details. Yes sir. - Open your mouth. - What happened, sir? Just open. Get down. Do you have a tissue? - Why sir? - Remove your shoe. Abhi, let's go Does your sir put his pen into people's mouths like this all the time? - Name? - Kumar. Ramu sir... With lot of effort we provided education to her. He cut her into pieces like a butcher. When was the last time she came home? She came here last month and stayed for two days. In majority of the cases, they select the victims from their circle. After selecting them, they plan it properly and execute them. So look closely in her social circle. Do you have any issues with anyone here? Or does anyone stalk your daughter or.... No sir. Why does someone do such a thing? What had she done sir? She doesn't interfere in anyone's lives. Is it wrong to even work hard to grow in life? He beheaded her. How insane is that sir! Imagine the pain my little girl would have underwent. May I know where can I find my daughter's remaining parts? What the hell is he doing with them? I beg you sir. Please do something and handover my daughter's complete body. At least I will give her a proper funeral. Will do sir. Generally, these kind of deviant behaviors stem from specific incidents. We call them stressers. In the majority of cases these stressors happen at the early age or adolescent age. Who is this guy? I think his name is Raghavadu. He lives in close by village Brahmanpally. Sir, did our Raghavudu commit any crime? See the tooth - Where is he now? - He works in Vizag city, sir. Give us his house and office address in Vizag. Write down his phone number too. Keep them arrested in the house until late night. Take their mobiles and be sure they don't contact anyone. - Abhi, - KD. I will send an address. There will be a guy named Raghavudu in that address. Keep an eye on him. He matches our profile exactly. Yeah. - Where? - It's here. He is yet to come. Varsha, you stay here. let's break it. Excuse me. Fila. Size nine. Conduct luminol test on this carefully. Check if it had any contact with blood. You guys head to forensics. - I will bring Raghavudu. - Yeah. What do you want sir? Where is Raghavudu? There he is, sir. You idiots, first listen to me. do that work.. Hey Srinu, behind you Be careful Don't stand like that How many times do I have to tell you? Raghavudu! - Who are you? - Need to talk to you. Let's go. - To where? Let's get out of here and talk. - Hey dad. - Police are coming to arrest you. Hello! Hello.. Raghava! Raghava! Hey... Wait. Stop. Brother, please save me... He is trying to kill me Police lock! This is a police lock! Hello Varsha! Raghavudu escaped. Arrest his parents. I said arrest his parents. Dad, police are coming... Why did you run away? I need to talk to my lawyer. Why did you kill Sanjana? Who are the other three girls? Speak out. What are you talking about? Which three girls you are talking about? On the day of Sanjana's murder, I was not even in Vizag. You were not here in Vizag? - Then where were you? - I was in Kakinada. Why did you go to Kakinada? I won't tell. It's personal. Hey you, If there is a genuine evidence that you were in Kakinada, You will be free. Otherwise you will be stuck here. Tell me why did you go to Kakinada? I won't tell. It's personal. Speak out. Speak out. - What? - KD, Luminol test is positive. Raghavadu had gone to the crime scene. These shoes sole matches with the footprints at the crime scene. You did it KD Got the bastard. Inform Nageswara Rao that we caught him. Ok sir. Get the date for a court hearing. We need to know who the other three women are, tonight. Sure -Be on it. Sure sir. We did it Abhi. I didn't do anything much. What happened? It seems you are in a romantic mood. Had a long day at work? Is it stomach pain? Did you tell your mom? I don't know. You did this, so you tell her. Arya... Aunty What? I need to tell you something. Arya.. ...is pregnant. You both couldn't control, right? But you both sleep in different rooms. How did this happen? Aunty, before you came here...... It is my fault that I gave you both this much time. I will arrange the wedding now. Sir, Forensics sent this to you. Abhi, they cracked the phone that you had given me. Call records and text messages. - Tell me if you need any help. - Sure. Tell me Abhilash. Sir, what you guessed was right. The bullet fired at Vikram... The smuggler who sold that bullet... Records shows that he called Viswa sir. And there are messages exchanged between the two. It is Vishwa sir who tried to kill Vikram. Now I understand why Vikram suddenly took off on a sabbatical without telling anyone. Abhilash, this should be between us. Don't discuss this with anyone. You start immediately to Hyderabad and come here. Okay sir. "Man of the hour", ladies and gentlemen. Amazing job KD. Well done. Well done. I didn't believe when Raghuvaran talked high about you. But now I can see your capability. Thank you sir, but praise me after the job is done. What do you mean? The other three victims... We need to know what happened to those girls right? Ahhh..Chuck it. That's not our headache. Law and order department will take care of that. Our business is just about the head. And that headache is done. What are you talking about? What about other three girls? What about their families? It's not just our duty to find those girls. It's our responsibility. I don't want any problems here. Transfer this case to the Law and Order department. I am going to call for a press meet. I will tell the same thing to the press too. Today is the first court hearing of the sensational case. Will the most cruel and merciless criminal Raghavudu be found guilty! We want justice! (Slogans) I won't tell. It's personal. Hey. People's frustration is increasing regarding Sanjana's case Will he be punished? I won't tell. It's personal. Arya! Did you drop mom? Yes, I dropped her at the airport When will you come home? I'll come around 6 PM Well, see you in the evening. I am going to the boutique Bye! Love you. Yeah, Bye! I said Love you Love you Bye. Bye. Some people are happy as they got tickets and some are very sad as they didn't get any tickets. Now we are at Kakinada Venkateswara talkies. Let's have some fun with people here. Bother tell... Varsha. Varsha Come here. Raghavudu was in Kakinada on that day. This is YouTube video. we need the original file. Enquire about the channel. We are leaving for Kakinada now. I make prank videos sir. Just for fun. I don't intended to create any problems. Do you have the original video file? - It's on a hard disk sir. - Bring that. I have checked the EXIF details. Those are matching. Raghavudu was not in Vizag on the day of Sanjana's murder. If we got this information a little later, we could have never caught the actual culprit. Varsha, we cannot reopen the case using this video. It's just a circumstantial evidence. Need to find the girl who was with Raghavudu in the video. You stay here, enquire and update me - Hello. - I am KD, Ranjith. Good evening Sir, Please tell me. Can you arrange a visit with Raghavudu tonight? Sir. Some time back, DGP sir sent three officers here. And they took him for a health check-up. Sir, there is a talk in the department... ...that he will be encountered tonight. you did not know this? - Where have they taken him? - I don't know the place, sir. But, it's been half an hour since they left. Shit! Yes, Kd. Sir, is there a plan to encounter Raghav? Sir, is there a plan to encounter Raghav? Yeah. DGP had called me earlier.He asked us to finish Raghavudu as the pressure is mounting. Sir please, stop that immediately. Do you think its a Nadikudi passenger train... ...which stops simply by pulling the chain anywhere? You Idiot- Sir, Please listen to me. Raghavudu is innocent. He has an alibi. He was in Kakinada on the day of Sanjana's death. Hey KD, don't create any new mess now. Shut your mouth and bring me what all evidence you have. - Goddamnit. - KD, I am serious. KD... Sir, don't get tensed. He will be removed within a short span of time. Sir. Someone named Krishna Dev had been calling you. Can't you see I am in a meeting with the minister? I will talk later. You go. Remove his cuffs. Throw the ball. - Bring that ball. - Sir! Ple.. Please sir. I won't do anything. Just go. No sir. Sorry sir. I think you understand why I brought you here. Don't waste my time... It's okay, take the call. We can do this later. sorry sir. Hey. I will kill you without any pain. - So, please go and bring the ball. - Sir! - Go, go. - Sir... - Go idiot. - Please Sir. Hello! Hello brother, It's me KD from HIT. What happened, sir? I urgently need your help, brother. It's an emergency brother. According to the information we received from Vizag jail, Police are planning an encounter. In the name of a Hospital visit, police took Raghavudu... What! What is happening man? How did this news leak? Court is taking time for judgement. -Sorry sir, please. - Bring my phone. - People are getting frustrated. First abort the encounter. Raising impatience in people all over. This government decided to kill Raghavudu. Is their decision justified? -Thank God! That's good. -Please keep watching TV 5 Hey, you stop. Hold on. Sir, not yet. We caught him sir. Yeah, we are coming sir. Bring him. Move... Hello! Ranjith, what happened? -Sir, I was trying to call you They are brining Raghavudu back. I think they did not do anything to him. Who the hell leaked the information? If the encounter happened after the news, we both would have been screwed. I am extremely sorry sir. You idiots. It seems you still have some more days to live on this earth. Let's go. Raghavudu had a girlfriend here in Kakinada. She got married recently. He did not want to drag her into the case. That's why he didn't mention her name. I won't tell. It's personal. He did all this for the girl. It would have been good if he had told us earlier Okay, you start from there. -Sure sir. Hey, they didn't encounter you today? Then they will surely do it tomorrow Sir! Come sir. Srinu, call the CI sir. Excuse me, sir, you got a call from your PRO. They are asking you to give a video bite on the Vizag encounter. Salute to our police. This is an example of how police will deal with guys who do such things to our women. Be Careful. Our police are correct and our police are great Yes, right... Our police are great Our police are great! Guys, what do you say? Yes! Numerous questions are raising on Raghavudu's suicide in Anakapalli Sub-Jail. Keeping aside the discussion about police involvement in this death... ... people of the two states are praising this event and celebrating for the last few hours. Police are unable to answer the questions from the press and media. Just encounter those fools. That is police power. Hello Rajitha. Where are you? I'm at home. What happened? Are you alone or with anyone? No sir, I'm with Kumar. - Why Sir? - Who is that? One minute. Okay, stay safe. I'm coming now. - Anyone knocked on your door? - No sir. - Wait. - No Sir... You guys stay here. Sir, can you please tell us what's this suspense about? Rajtha's life us under threat. Kumar, it's not Raghavaudu who killed Sanjana and the other three girls. That was someone else. Now he is targeting Rajitha. Why does someone target Rajitha Sir? What has she done? It's nothing. Rajitha, be careful, don't go anywhere alone. If someone needs to do something to her, they will have to first cross me. I will handle it, sir. [Dog barking] Shit. Arya. Arya.. Arya.. KD.. What happened? Why don't you keep your phone with you instead of putting that bloody thing on silent and throwing it in your bag. Why are you shouting at me like that? I found him in my boutique store room. We will raise him. Hey, careful. In general these criminals are very dumb, they are bird-brained 5 Minutes is enough to catch them. KD, are you done? Max, search! Max! Max! Hey, Come here. - What happened? - Busy with work. Okay, carry on. You need to be with madam every second. She is pregnant, so be careful. She doesn't know that she had a threat. Okay sir. - She is not supposed to know. - Okay sir. You stay at that back gate. Okay sir. The end of the road... KD...When did you wake up? I couldn't sleep I was talking to them about a task Listen... Madam's safety is your responsibility from today. Okay sir. Why do I need security? I am dealing with a high-profile case. Its formality. It's just a rule. Sir, an innocent man died. We have to do something. Sir, we will call for a press meet. We will admit that a mistake has been made. We will announce that we are starting the investigation again. See how people are celebrating! They are worshiping us by believing that its encounter and not suicide. What you will announce in this situation? That we arrested an innocent guy and the original killer is still out there, roaming free. They will spit on us. So are you going to cover up the mistake? You! Don't talk rubbish. See, Raghavudu is dead anyways. His parents don't have the capability to defend in court. Find the IDs of the body parts of remaining three dead bodies- - Those were not just dead bodies, sir. - Hm. - They were girls, they were victims. - Yeah that's what. Find out who the other three girls are... ... cook up some connections to Raghavudu and close the case. Sir, what if this serial killer starts killing again? Then tell he is a copycat killer. Open a new case. I don't care. - This fuckup cannot be known by anyone. - Sir, you are not getting the point. He threatened my girlfriend, he came off into my home. That's is why I sanctioned two constables as security. it's common to have such threats in the police department. Do you want Z-category force for your girlfriend! What are you talking? We have to get him Shraddha. I'm sure the shoes used in the crime scene were Raghavudu's. Okay, let's say someone framed Raghavudu. What about those teeth marks? There are two possibilities. First one, The killer may know that Raghavudu has an extra tooth... ... and marked it with a sharp item. Second one... The killer may also have an extra tooth. Maybe, that's why he would have targeted Raghavudu, to mislead us. I am already worried that my customers are going off to the competitor's pub. Now, what is this sir! Oh! do you notice anyone with extra tooth in your pub regulars? No sir, I couldn't remember anyone. Have you ever seen this girl? Is this the girl who has pub stamp on her hand? We don't know whose hand it was! Then how would we know about this girl sir? We will stay here till 9.00 pm. We will go to nearby pub at 10.00, it has superb music. What about that Raghavudu E-mail? Someone sent from an Internet cafe. But we didn't found any customer details or CCTV footage. Already, I'm worrying as people are going to the other pub! We will stay here till 9.00. We will go to nearby pub at 10.00. Pub hopping! What? People move from one pub to another pub. We missed that Varsha. Brother! Stamp. Stamp! Don't you have a stamp! Please come aside. You guys change the dates! As there is entry fees, we change the date daily. 16th June. Sorry sir, For every two weeks CCTV footage will be overwritten. Six months! Not possible sir. Sir, once check this file. What if we examine all credit and debit card transactions on 16th June? In case, if that girl or any of her friends had made at least one transaction! We can track her identity easily. Nice. Sir! Tanya. She is 26 years old female. Those hands belong to her. Her family lives in Waltair, Vizag. She used to work in a beauty clinic before she went missing. She missed a few weeks before her wedding. - Call for the press. - Okay sir. We want justice (Slogans) Raju, take care of them Stop it, please. You all are aware of the recent serial murder case that happened in Vizag. We got the second girl's identity. Tanya. Age 26. She works in a beauty clinic. Her parents filed a missed report six months back. We are in the process of finding the identities of remaining victims also. I'll let you know soon. Thank you. Sir.. sir.. sir... Not answering any questions Varsha, check Tanya and Sanjana's call records. - Check whether they knew each other. - Sure sir. We need to know. - Hello. - I saw your press meet video earlier. In the case you are handling, did a girl named Tanya get murdered? - Yes. Why? - I know her KD. How do you know? She used to come for these gender equality seminars. She was a member of the welfare association here. Where are you now? I am conducting a workshop here at 'Her Welfare Association'. Okay, I'm coming there. - Sushma madam. - Ha. - He is KD. - Hello. He needs some information about Tanya. Please help him. Tanya.. I don't remember anyone with that name. Swaroopa... - yes, Ma'am. - Do you know Tanya? - Tanya Sheik. - Nowadays she is not coming here. She used to come here before you joined here. - From when have you been working here? - Three months. Before you? Pooja worked here as a president before me. She left for Hyderabad. I heard she went missing immediately after she went to Hyderabad. What! Her dead body was dug out recently. Yes, KD. Pooja, Vizag 'Her Welfare Association' president... She was murdered in Hyderabad. I need those case files. Pooja! yeah, I remember that case. Tanya who used to work as a volunteer in your organization is dead. Your former president Pooja is dead. Something is happening here. Call all the members of your organization for a gathering. If anyone used to be close with Pooja, call them. There was a housekeeping women named Durgamma. Also, she used to work in Pooja's house. She used to work here from the beginning of this organization. - Yeah, get her. - Okay. Abhi, About Pooja who used to work as president of Vizag's women welfare association, Her dead body was dug out four months back at Hyderabad city outskirts. And, Vikram Rudhra Raju was the one who was handling this case. Interestingly, the left hand was missing in this dead body. I'm going through this case file. Call me after you get all the information. I will be waiting. - I'll call you. - Okay. What you expected is correct Kd, Sanjana was a member of women's welfare association. Same way, the other two girls went missing from other women's organizations. Tanya, Sanjana, Pooja.. All of them were members of women's welfare organization. Bastard! He is targeting women in woman welfare associations. Even though this many women were missing like this, How can the police missed this? They think all these are eloping cases. And like Tanya, many women don't even tell the world that they are working with women's welfare organisation. I think Rajitha is also a member of a women's welfare organization. Shit! not answering. Keep calling Rajitha until she answers. Come madam. KD, Duragamma. Come this way madam. - Sit down madam. - Sit down madam. Madam. Before the death of the ex-president who worked here... ... Did she have any issues with anyone? Are any differences of opinion with anyone? I don't know sir. Please try to remember madam. I don't remember anything Sir. It's been many years, right! I can't remember sir. What do you mean many years! It's just four months back right! Your recent president, Pooja madam. Oh! you are asking about Pooja madam. I thought it's about Jhansi madam. Who is Jhansi? Fifteen years back, Jhansi madam used to be the president here, sir. She was a very good person. She doesn't have any issues with anyone. All of a sudden, she was murdered by someone. What about her family? She doesn't have family sir. She used to live alone. - Do you know where is Jhansi's house? - It's in Madhurawada. I used to work there. Varsha, get the address. You need to be very careful. Shut down the office for some time. Send a message to all of your members to be careful. Okay sir. - Take care. - Arya. What's happening Kd? You don't worry at all. I will catch that bloody idiot tonight. I will come home. Will you be safe? Of Course. You don't get tensed at all. Go home and sleep peacefully. - Hey. - Sir. All you eight members take madam home. - Guard the house. - Okay sir. - Be alert. - Okay sir. Jhansi had kids? Durgamma told Jhansi didn't have even a family. Something is not adding up. Height markings. This was a kids' room. Father. Son. Mother. Varsha. Father. His name is Ram Prasad. obituary Ad. It's from his son. Till date. Chicken skull diagram. The diagram on the wall inside. Diagrams in a tree house. It's all the same style. Even the artwork is the same. Father. Mother. Son. Father died. By hanging himself Son is crying. But mother, She is laughing. See these horns. She was the monster in his life. What does this mean? Sword. Blood. Madam, File. - Sir. - Thank you. - What's this? - Jhansi Autopsy report. She was brutally murdered. Finger.. chopped off. Max, come back. Max, come back. He's gone. - Come on. - Sir. Get the files. Max. Vizag's women welfare association president, named Pooja. Just one week before her death, some suspect was following her in a black hoodie. Yeah, I remember. What about it? Vikram had sent that picture to you for depixelation. What happened to that depixelated picture? I depixelated the image and sent it back to Vikram. - It may be in the Vikram file. - No, it's not there. I think Viswa sir took it personally and handled. Then I will go and check Vishwa sir's house You send the picture in an e-mail meanwhile. Newspaper offices are not responding This will take some time. Then we need to search all old newspapers here Varsha. I need to know all dates when he posted obituary Ads. I want his name. - Hello.. Hello.. - Hello. There will not be reception here, sir. - Hello. - Are you able to hear me? yes Shinde, tell me. Our team emailed you the image. Check it out. Varsha.. Yeah! Madam, Myself Hari. I'm Pooja's husband. You asked me to call Pooja's husband, right! That's why I called him here. Hello Sir. After watching your press meet, I came to know that warnings are not enough for you. You are pursuing the case against my will. You are fired. Paperwork took some time. Why sir? Because you leaked Raghavudu’s encounter matter to the press. Don't you understand? After checking your call records, we came to know that you leaked the Raghavudu's information. Congratulations. Entire police department is angry with you. Kd. I removed the security given to your girlfriend. I thought you should know this. Come and collect the dismissal order. Shit! Come on... come on... come on... Arya! Arya! KD! KD! Arya. He took her. Kd. Please don't break down. Who will save Arya if you get emotional like this? Who will catch the criminals if you get emotional like this? Tell me. For nine years he has been posting obituary Ads in different newspapers... ... for his dad on the same date. We have to find out his name The name is not here Same! Three different years. Three different newspapers. Whenever there had been an obituary ad, there was this dental camp ad too. It can't be a coincidence See this logo... It's like the same art we found in the treehouse. Bite mark on neck. Extra tooth. Tanya braces. All are related to dentistry. Does Sanjana wear braces? - No. - Check properly. Transparent braces. You can find it only when you look closely. He is a dentist, Varsha. He has been right under our noses all this while. Is this dentist targeting all the women who are working in women's welfare associations? That's why he targeted Arya. There is no name and location of the dental clinic mentioned here. .. except the location of dental health camp that was organized. Arya's planner. She writes everything in her diary. Varsha, he targeted Rajitha. Enquire about her dentist. KD, no one is answering. - Shit. - You go to Rajitha's place. - Get the address and call me. - Okay. KRP Dental Arya. Arya. You asked me to call Pooja's husband right! That's why I called him here. - Yes Abhilash. - Varsha, its Kumar. What? It's Rajitha's boyfriend Kumar whom we are searching for. I called KD. Where is he? You sleep. I will wake you up later. Where women are worshipped… there blossoms divinity. Where women are not worshipped… there, all action remains unfruitful. Did you wake up? Relax. - Cool. - Arya.. - Where is Arya? - Hm. Kumar! Kumar, Where is she? Kumar, tell me where is Arya? Kumar.. - Leave Arya out of this please. - Hm. Where is Arya? You just said let's leave Arya out of this? Again, why are you asking about Arya! [Shouting in pain] You son of a ****, where is Arya? If you call me that again... or if you ask about Arya again.. I will immediately kill. Not you. Arya. Good! Why? What, speak loud, can't hear you. Why do you do all these? We are bird-brained, right! You need to decode with your intelligence. Women's welfare organizations. Why are you killing the women in women's welfare organizations? Why all this investigation before dying? I will never know after you die right? Oh! Confidence! Hey, Kumar. Kumar. Arya.. Arya.. Arya. I'm so sorry. What happened to your confidence now? Kumar. Arya, you don't worry. You will be okay, I promise. Lies. He is lying. You two are not making it out alive from here. - Hey. - Oh. Hey, Kumar. Three right! Hey, Kumar. What, man! I am not so cruel to kill an unborn child. I will just kill the mother. Hey. Are you okay? Even though you irritated me a lot.. I like the attention you gave to me KD. That is why I emailed you that Raghavudu is not culprit But you touched my treehouse. It hurt me a lot. That's my temple. Do you know how I will kill you? I did not let you sleep for the last two days. Your body's circadian rhythm would have gone for a toss now. Your blood will have a peculiar smell now. It's intoxicating. This time it will be your head... ... and madam's torso. Just imagine how it will be. Now tell me. Who do we start with? Why did you kill your mother Kumar? You thought, I didn't know anything about you! Your anguish on your mother. You left home after your father died. You killed your mom and decorated your father's photograph with your mother's toe ring. You are a psychopath. Oh! who is not a psychopath? Who is not a psychopath? A twelve year old boy. A father that he loved the most. These two lives got destroyed by... ... a women for her sexual pleasures. They say she is my mother. Wasn't she a psychopath? And all these women who supported her... are they not psychopaths? What Should I do to them? Kumar, Arya did not harm anyone She always wants everyone to be happy Just because your mother worked in a welfare organisation, how can you kill all the women in there! What the fuck kind of logic is that? Arya wanted to have a life with me. So what? They are all the same. How is it that all are the same you idiot? If your father knew about you, He would have killed you before he died. Enough! [Sarcastic laughing] Don't irritate me Why are you laughing? I know that I am going to die tonight. Something struck my mind. You are saying that you are doing all this for your father. And you are saying your mother is a whore. What is the guarantee that you are born to your father? [Sarcastic laughing] Hey, take your words back. [Laughing continues] I will kill you. Take it back. I saw your father's photo in the reception. Not even one feature matches. Even if there is a slight match of the features in the photograph, I will agree See.. see. See.. See again. I have my fathers eyes. How can you say that? Kumar.. Thank you. [Whistle] Max. Max. No! He killed He said he will kill me She is okay. So you decided that it's a girl! Max? Where is Max? Max. I'm sorry KD. Why don't you come and join our department? It's my mistake. I'm sorry. I did this, just to avoid any problems in the department. Sir! Take care sir. Hm, you too. Varsha. How did you know the location of the dental clinic? When I joined the department here, you were not letting me work properly. So I planted a GPS tracker on your car. So you haven't change yet? No, now I have changed. - Your baby bump is visible, cover it. - That's okay mom. Let's laugh. You asked for a transfer to Telangana right! I arranged it. - Thank you sir. - Join quickly. - You guys look so cute together. - Thank you. KD. The new officer who is joining in your place is coming here to meet you. Who? About whom are you talking? Arjun Sarkar. One of the most ruthless cops we have in our state. They say, 100 culprits can escape, but, one innocent person should not be punished. But he says, One criminal also shouldn't escape even at the cost of 100 innocent people's lives. The real psychopath. 16 enquiries, 8 Transfers, 3 suspensions.. Basically this guy is a... walking nightmare. Am I late to the party? Hi, KD. - Hi. - Sarkar. Heard about you. They said its is a wedding. Is it a baby shower? It's a wedding. Quite fast. By the way... Congratulations. Wine! - All the best for the baby. - Thank you. So Telangana it is! You take care of her. I will take care of HIT. Only God can save HIT now. "The blood on my hands...
