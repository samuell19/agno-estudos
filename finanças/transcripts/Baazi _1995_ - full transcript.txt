Even the children of this country know... ...that the deal for tanks which we had with the Gunstorm Company... ...has a pay-off over a billion involved. Who is the man who has swindled the money? Who is the one... ...to have betrayed the people of India? Whoever he is... he's now within our reach... ...and he will not be able to escape. That's my word to you. In order to find out the identity of that man... ...I have appointed three responsible citizens of this city. I'm Mr. Vishwasrao's Deputy Minister. With Gunstorm, an American arms-manufacturing Company... ...our Government had entered into an agreement. I pocketed the brokerage in the deal that took place. This is something that only people in the American company know... ...and I know. And now, before... ...Mr. Vishwasrao goes to America and unearths my name... ...and turns me into a mere peon from a Deputy Minister... ...this mission must be carried out. Otherwise, neither will you be of any use to me... ...and nor will I be of any use to you. - That's right, isn't it? - Yes, it is right. It's already pretty late... people are waiting for you. Two members of the Enquiry Commission are dead. You're the 3rd... aren't you afraid? How can anyone be scared of traitors? What do the traitors of the nation think? Will the elimination of three individuals wipe out the nation too? Will we now be scared? Not at all! This Enquiry Commission... will now be headed by me. I always wanted you to be at the forefront of this noble endeavor! Victory to India! Quiet, now! This doesn't work! I'll get you another, once we get home. Okay? I want one right now! Make him shut up, will you? This is terrible! What are you up to, Mister! This is a special bus... there are no vacant seats! Get aside! There no special buses as far as we are concerned! Can't you see, the bus is full! Where'll you sit? On my lap?! You will provide the lap... ...but Tony, where will you sit? Any seat will do for me! - This bag? - It's made of leather. You'll get a slap, smart-ass! Make yourself scarce! I can't get scarce... but I can get fatter, if you wish. You want to mess with us, do you? There's no room for that in here... ...how about stepping out? - Is it?! This punk's itching for a fight! Let's get even then! Come on! Let's go, driver! That was a great trick! The bus halts for ten minutes... you may refresh yourselves! And take care of your belongings. Let's go and buy a chocolate for you. It's the same boy who was in the bus. Which means the smart-ass must be around too! Let's look for him! Give it to me... - Did you find him? - No... He must be in the bus. - Did you take a proper look? - There he is! Looks like they've arrived. Why, smart-ass?! They're bulletproof windshields! Smash them! You will not escape, Minister! Who are you? A servant... A government-servant. The one you just killed... ...was my brother! The Law knows no relationships. Give me a soda. Minister Vishwasrao was attacked on the National Highway this morning. A report from India This Week. There was this man from there... ...from there... ...look at his courage... he came charging from there and... ...sprang on one of the terrorists here. He gave the chap a sound thrashing! Where did this man spring from? We just couldn't know... This man has killed a brother of mine... ...and has had another arrested. This is indeed our good fortune! That man, whom we don't know, was present at the Inn... ...and Mr. Vishwasrao's life was saved. - How did you find the capsule? - Third-rate. - What? - Do you call that a program? It's worse than a newsreel! It's absolutely bogus! Why is it "bogus", Uncle? You've called me "Uncle" again! Had you not been my niece, I'd have dumped you in the dustbin! But at least tell me what mistake I've made. Good Lord! I'll have to tell her about her mistakes now! You've interviewed the public, okay. But where's the "hero's" interview? Who's the hero? The chap who was present at the Inn and who saved the minister. Now look, Sanjana... ...I think you'd better return to your parents in America... ...find a good boy and settle down in life. Building a career is not your cup of tea. Bye... You want that man's interview, don't you? I will hunt him down and get his interview. We've made enquiry's about the man. His name is Amar Damji. Such brave young men should get a reward for their bravery. He has an amazing agility in his body... ...with his brains working much faster. He's no ordinary man. Beware, Deshpande... the enemy cometh in the garb of a friend! Don't you worry, Jamdade... We'll immortalize this Amar Damji... much before his time. - I hear, he's very strict. - Let's see... Welcome, Mr. Amar! I'm Jamdade... And my name is Deshpande. Please come... You were really brave to have saved the Minister's life! But you'd better be careful; They're a dangerous lot. But you won't have to be scared, till we're both around! We're not only officers here, but two strong "shoulders"...! ...who take the entire responsibility of the office! Perhaps this is why you have a stoop in your left-shoulder. I have full confidence in these shoulders you possess. I'm sure that... if I'm killed... ...you will surely carry my corpse to the crematorium. But why should you die? May death befall your enemies! Besides, we haven't joined the force to lose our lives, have we? The truth is that we join... ...the Police force to sacrifice our lives. I'm absolutely ready and willing. Get prepared too, and join me inside. You have been sent here on a Special Mission. But you have proved even before taking charge that... ...you are the Police Officer... ...who can protect the lives of the important personalities of the city. There's another thing... You will also have to find about those people... ...who are bent on spreading disturbances in the nation. I realize what I have to do. Those, who are out to destroy our Nation... ...will very soon be behind bars. The Minister's here, sir. - How are you, Majumdar? - Fine. You could've sent for me. Why did you take the trouble? I've come to thank this brave police officer. I know such brave officers don't accept words of gratitude. They attribute their deeds to their duty. But it's my duty too... ...to thank courageous brave officers like you. Who has saved my life. Who could have attacked you? Do you have any suspicions? I never grope in the darkness, Majumdar. Write to me for anything that you need to fight these terrorists. I'll immediately endorse it. Glory to India. This Court sentences Raghunath Singh, alias Dashrath Singh... ...under Section 302 and 304... ...to death. I announce in this very Court that I will not let you live! You have killed my brother... ...my Munna! Till yesterday I accepted contracts to kill other people... But today, I have given my self a contract... ...to destroy you! - I will destroy you! - And I will await you. You will not have to wait for very long! I will certainly avenge my brother's death! I will not let you live... I will not! What's all this? Why have all of you got into my house? We had no other way, Minister. I am still not a proper Minister, my friend... ...l'm still a mere Deputy Minister. All thanks to you! You first goofed up in killing Vishwasrao... ...and now descend with a battalion on my house! Are you out to have me sacked from my position then? Vishwasrao's security has been doubled! And for an investigation in what you did... what is he called? By calling someone Amar, does he really become Amar (immortal)? Forget Vishwasrao for the time being and get rid of Amar. No... Nobody will even touch him. Why is that? - He's not related to you, is he? - No. He is Raghu's prey. Now listen, Madam... ...that Raghu hasn't merely attempted to rape a woman! ...that he'd be out of prison in a week! He's been held under TAD A! T-A-D-A! How does it matter whether Raghu kills Amar or somebody else does! It does. It makes a lot of difference. Govind was our brother. Therefore, his death will be avenged, as we want to. Whether you avenge it your way... ...or mine... ...be quick with whatever you have to do. If Amar Damji were to start bothering me... ...then I won't spare you. - I'm coming. - Hurry up. - Hurry up, Amar... - Are you too coming with us? Yes. I must pay his fees and even go to the market. Are you comfortable? - Drink your milk, Amar... - No, I will not have milk! - But why? - I won't have it till Papa returns. - Who the hell are you?! - A thief... no! A servant here! And who are you? The man of the house. - It's pronounced AMAR. Not AMAD. - That's it... A-M-A-D! - Not with a 'D'... with an 'R'. - That's what I've said! But, sir, why did you have to come in from the rear like a thief? Had that iron-bar struck me, I'd have been dead, right?! Just a minute! Just you hold on! Who's in there?! There's no one in there! You may go in now. You seem to be a smart detective. You've got it! By God, you've recognized me! You could recognize the genius hidden in me! I'll open it... Where were you trained? Nowhere at all! All those detective-novels I've read... ...have made my brain tick! - It shows on your face. And how will it not?! I have it in my blood! My grandpa was a jailer of the British era! Then how haven't you still become an Inspector? Do you think I don't want to be an Inspector? The Police Department won't let me! You will see once I don the uniform as to what I can do! Now that you've been transferred here, please do something for me! Well, okay... but can you do something for me right now? - Can I get a cup of tea? - What's mere tea? A "sherbet"... ...or any other cold drink... I will get you everything you want! In this house, it's I who... - Damji here... - This is the collector speaking. - Yes? - The file of evidence against... ...Chaube, which you have... - Why are you worried? That file on Chaube is in my custody. Till such time as the file reaches your desk, no one can even touch it. You don't know anything about Chaube. He's a Councilor only in name. Otherwise, he's a dreaded hoodlum. I'm also told that he's coming to your house. Be careful, okay? Very well. - Was it the file on Jeevanlal? - Yes. - You both will remain inside. - But you... Don't question me, Shanti... and do as I say. - I'm getting scared... - Go on now... - Suppose something happens to you? - Nothing will happen to me. I, Mr. Chaube, have stepped onto your threshold, Damji... ...you can say you've found someone to pay you your price. One loses a lot of precious time in observing social niceties. Don't worry about my time... I've got plenty of it. But I have none! I've only just become a Member of Legislative Assembly... ...I must be a Member of Parliament and a Minister too... ...there's so much to do in such a short life! Very true. You have a very short life. Shall we use the 'short-cut' then? Where's the need to sit down? Now look... ...l've already paid you in cash. And I also promise you a promotion. Just give me that file in which there is evidence against me. Now look, a politician has great reach... If that is true... then stretch and pick up the file. So that is the file, eh! - Beat him up! - Don't you dare! You won't come around like this. You're bent on killing yourself! People like me join the Police Force to sacrifice their lives. - What happened? - A lot. - Tell me something... - Chaube will always rue this day. - And where are you going now? - To the Collector's office. Mother... Mother... What's happened, mother? Your father hasn't yet returned, son. Go to sleep now. Auntie? Shanti... my dear... What happened, sir? Nothing... I happened to recall something... I'll take it. Just a minute. It's a Sanjana Roy... she wants to interview you. Refuse it. I don't want to give an interview. He does not want to give an interview. That's correct. Had Damji listened to me, you'd have still been a married woman. I tried to make him see reason. But he wouldn't understand. Haven't you become a widow now? And look at that boy... isn't he looking like a proper orphan?! As if he were a beggar's son! Never mind! Just step inside... Run away, Amar! - Mother! - Grab the boy! Run away son... ...for my sake, run away! Get him! Don't let him escape! Look at these dirty clothes! Even the laundry would refuse them! And it's so hot, I feel like just stripping! Must be someone for you. - Is Mr. Amar Damji there? - Why? I'm Sanjana Roy, a journalist from "India This Week"... ...we want to interview him. Oh yes! He's very much here. Mr. Amar! Come along. Do you want to become an Inspector? Good Lord! Must you ask me now?! - Dress up quickly then! - Why? Am I in the nude right now? - Tea for you, Madam... - Move aside! - Where's your boss? - He'll be here in a minute. Madam... will you take a photograph of mine, too? Go and attend to your work. Is everything set, Mohan? Here's the boss! - I want an interview with you. - That's very good... ...how much of money will I be paid for it? - Money? - What else! I've spent money too! How will I give you an interview for nothing? So what if I'm doing a job... I haven't lost my business acumen! Now getting cracking with the interview! I want to know how you saved Mr. Vishwasrao's life. He loves playing with danger! - Who's "He"? - I mean... it's me! When children used to play with toy-guns... ...I amused myself with marbles. - Marbles! I went wrong! It happens when I speak to a girl! I get nervous! He means he's been playing with guns and bullets since he was a child. Sir's right! "Sir"? Who's that? This servant of mine! The chap's name is "Sir"! I see. Can you recall the moment... ...when the guns of the terrorists were about to spray bullets... ...how did you feel then? - How did I feel?! Anger! He was absolutely livid! - Yes. I was fuming! - Why is that? Because I wondered why I was walking into the jaws of death! I wanted someone to stop me! But you said you loved playing with danger! That's it; he says something and does something else. Exactly! That's the problem. I never do what I say I will! And I rescued Vishwasrao from the jaws of death... ...beat up the killers, made life miserable for them... ...and brought the same old heart. How have you found my interview? There's a last question. Would you suggest something for the improvement of the Police force? Once... just once... ...let me get my hands on a uniform... ...and you will see... ...then you will see! - What? - How I iron the uniform... - Iron it? - How I have it laundered! - Laundered? What do you mean? He means a cop's reputation should never get tainted by corruption! Wonderful! Bravo, chappie! Thank you! ...For the interview! And thanks to you, too. Why him? It's I who gave you the interview... for free! That's right. But had it not been for him... ...I wouldn't have understood half the things you said! That's Raghu; the most dangerous member of their gang. He's not afraid of killing... nor is he scared of losing his life. It's good that you arrested him. It's a major success for us. And this is Shiva... Raghu and Govind's brother. He is the one operating from a secret hideout. His aides are Rani and Raju Pandit. You have to get to Shiva. And this is the only picture we have with us. Mangal Singh... known for the big, Rajasthani moustache he sports. - An acid caused his left... - Who are you talking about, sir? This is my daughter, Anjali. - What doubt? - He doesn't look like a Commando. That's something special about Amar. He doesn't seem to be what he is. I have a specialty, too. I don't seem to be what I really am. And what I am, I don't seem to be. - Did you understand? - Yes, I did. I'm leaving for my college. Bye... You can choose any officer you need for your assistance. - I'd like to handle the case alone. - Why is that? - Don't you trust my officers? - It's not that at all... But to win a game of chess... ...you need a person to concentrate, not several brains to spoil things. Wow! Wow! Wonderful! - Mr. Chaturvedi! - We seem to share our ideas! How could you be so bright, even when you're not a Chaturvedi? - That's Amar Damji, sir. - I know that... ...I know the contents of a letter from the look of the envelope! Now look... ...Mr. Vishwasrao must be a Minister for everyone in the world. But for me... he's like an elder brother. He's like a parent to me. In fact, you have not merely saved his life... ...you have saved me from being orphaned. And you... you don't really know what it is to be orphaned. I know very well... how it feels to be orphaned. If there is anything you need... ...at anytime... ...ask me for it. Okay? Who do you think this person is? This? It's Saab (Sir); Amar Damji's servant. Oh Lord! People are destroyed by their enemies... ...but in my case, my own niece is out to ruin me! Now look, sir... there are no relationships in business. Just tell me what I've done. Then tell me something, Madam. Do you want people to tear out my hair at this age of mine? - Or tear my clothes? - No... Or then hurl stones at me as they would at a madman? Then where is Amar Damji's interview? There it is! "This" is Amar Damji. That's his servant there... ...and this... ...is your ticket for America. That chap's my servant. His name itself is "Sir". I get nervous when I talk to girls. It's you, eh?! Welcome! Welcome! My interview seems to have been a roaring success, right? Don't act smart... or I'll have you sent to prison! I'll never give an interview again! I swear it by my grandfather! - Get on with it! - I will, friend... Forgive me, Madam! ...I only did as Mr. Amar asked me to. What else could I do? - But now you will do as I say. - What is that?! - Is this report complete? - Yes, sir. Pass the phone to Inspector Amar. You may leave... It's Amar speaking. - I have your servant in my custody! - Who is the man? If you want to save his life... ...come across the bridge over the river. - Who are you? - What will you do knowing that? Listen to his voice, if you can't believe me. Save me, Mr. Amar, or else, this chap will kill me! Did you hear that? "You're on foot and your goal is far away" "My sympathies are with you" "As I say, darling... I will walk with you" "As I say, darling... I will walk with you" "What are we waiting for?" "I know it's a long journey; but why are you afraid?" "I'm young and passionate; there's romance in the air" "As I say, darling... I will walk in step with you" "You have been walking... you must take a breather" "You have been walking... you must take a breathing" "Walk you must..." "You have far to go... so listen to me" "As I say, darling... I will walk in step with you" "As I say, darling... I will walk in step with you" "I've made a mistake, all right" "But please don't ridicule me like this" "Looks like you'll say..." "don't worry me" "C'mon, sisters... beat him up" "It was a mistake someone else made" "So don't treat me like this" "Looks like you'll say... don't bother me" "I'm not guilty, I'm innocent" "I hope I don't hurt them" "Why have you stopped walking, darling?" "Why have you stopped walking, darling?" "What are we waiting for?" "You have a long way to go, okay. But what are you afraid of" "I'm young and passionate; there's romance in the air" "As I say, darling..." "I've heard you, lady" "As I say, darling..." "I've heard you, lady" We sent our delegates there on two occasions... ...but the Gunstorm Company refused to divulge the name of the person... ...who has pocketed over a billion of public money. It is a matter of great regret that some corrupt politicians... ...are filling their coffers with money from such deals. Can you tell us what you and your Government are doing in this regard? I will myself go to America now... ...and I can assure you that I will not return empty-handed. I will get the name of the person who is the real culprit. And it will not be me or you... but the public who will punish him. My deputy Mr. Chaturvedi will now answer your queries. Jai Hind. Yes, gentlemen? I have all the answers for you. What are you doing in this uniform? Didn't I tell you that I don't look what I really am? - I'm a Cadet of the N.C.C. - I see. Excuse me, sir... I have something to ask you for. - When are you coming home? - Er? Very soon! ...as to how they work. If I could get some live-coverage... I'll solve your problem just now. This is Ms Sanjana Roy from "India This Week". She wants to make a TV program on your profession. - Is a week enough for you? - I'll do my best, sir. - Even two weeks are okay! - But, sir... At 9 a.m. Tomorrow. Once I get my hands on you! What do you think my first move should be, Hira? My moves are all haywire, sir! Get out now! Come on! What are you up to? The rat's hiding in the hole. I'm trying to get it out. Don't put your hand in there, it might bite you! To ferret the rat out, tempt it out with a crispy... I mean, tempt it with some bread. - What's in it? - Open up! - A gun! - Not a mere gun, it's an army-gun! Forget it. I know where this gun belongs. Let's go! Over here! What's it? Get lost! You won't get anything more! - But we've come to give something. - What is it? We won't tell you. We'll tell Mr. Kasim... it's imported. Come along. - Where did you find this? - In the dustbin! Lying there! In the dustbin, did you say? You dare lie to me! - I swear by my mother! - Are we fools to lie to you? Drive them away with some money. Is that all, sir? We came to you with great hopes! We knew only you'd need such a thing in the whole of the town! - What was that?! - It's okay, sir... - Get lost! - Thanks, sir! ...we'll see you soon with something more. That's a promise. Well, Mister, have you seen a black-colored bag of mine? - It had two guns... - Hey punks! Who the hell is he? There it is! Thank God I've found it! It's just that the gun belongs to the Police Department. To the Government. One has to return it, doesn't he? Hey! Who the hell are you! Shall we go to the lock-up then? You'll get ample air and a lot of kicks there! Who do you sell the guns to? We don't sell them, sir. It was only to knock someone off... ...that I bought these two guns. Those who "knock" others off... ...are large-hearted enough to lose their own lives, too. Let's see how large-hearted you are. No... sir! I'll tell you! I sell them to Raju Pandit... I don't know anything else, sir! But I do know... that there are still bullets in my gun. His stuff is arriving in a tanker, sir! Can I know where we are going? Don't you want to tell me? That's okay! What is the difference between the life of a commando and a commoner? A commando is a commando and a common man is a common man. Why don't you wear a uniform like the police? Nor is your hair like the police. Why don't you have it trimmed? I don't wear a police-uniform, because I'm a Commando. And I don't trim my hair because there's no barber where I stay. Is this how you behave with every girl? Is this what you've been trained in? Will you stop your childish questions now? Do I look like a child to you? I've done a course in journalism! - Do you understand? - Oh yes. You have indeed grown. But only physically. Not mentally. Sit tight now. If you fall... ...your body will shrink like your brains! So, I'm a kid! I've no brains! And you! ...you're the bright boy! Is this a place to park your car? Keep your camera ready. Hey! Look there! We're sunk! It's the same Inspector! Move aside, Amar! He won't budge! Get down, all of you! Out! What is it? Who do you think you are for stopping us like this? You dare open fire! Don't you know we're carrying oil in there? Well, Inspector? What kind of high-handedness is this? - Where are you taking the stuff? - What stuff? Can't you see it's an oil tanker? A tricky situation, Deshpande! Let's find out... What are you doing, sir? It's only an oil tanker! It has something else. Not oil. What else can there be, sir? It's oil, for sure! Get on top of the carrier and see what it contains! What else can an oil-tanker contain, but oil, sir? It's oil, sir. Did you see that, sir? Didn't we say it was oil! Run! It's amazing, sir! One couldn't even dream that... This is why we have great respect for you! Get hold of these rascals! Arrest them! You dare carry explosives in an oil tanker! You look like a street-side ruffian! I'm going in and you will wait here. If I don't return in 20 minutes, go straight to the police station. Well, darling... haven't you recognized me? No. What drink will you have? Orange or Lemon? You don't think I've come shopping for fruits, do you? - I want to meet Raju Pandit. - Raju Pandit? You bet! Go and tell him Akhtar Hyderabadi has arrived. What name was that? I swear by the Charminar! You've big eyes, not ears! Go and tell him, will you? Go on! Call him over. I'm Raju Pandit. And who are you? Well, Pal! Have you forgotten Akhtar Hyderabadi? - I think I've seen you somewhere. - Speak softly... ...and do not repeat what you just said in Hyderabad. Even a kid would laugh at you! After all, who does not know Akhtar Hyderabadi! Now look, punk! Stop picking my brains! Come straight to the point. What is it? I want to buy an imported gun. A gun?! Whoever told you that we sell guns here! The guys out there. Who else? Actually, pal... l've been sent here by Kasimbhai. Have you got the dough? Dough! My pants are being pulled down with the weight of money! If you don't believe me, should I show you? Come along now. My wife has a lover, Raju... ...whose passions I want to put an end to! Give me a gun that will pump all the bullets in him at one go! Do you understand now? They've fooled me enough! Is this where the military's stocks its arms? Wait for sometime. Some more of my stuff is on its way. AK-47s... automatic. Show him whatever he wants, Murthy. - This is Shiva speaking. - What is it, Mr. Shiva? Kasim has been arrested by the police. And the vehicle carrying our arms has been seized. - What?! - You must be careful now... ...that cop could be hot on your trail. Hold on for a minute... - Do you intend to kill me! - This is not even loaded! Put it away. I don't want a gun pointing at me! Don't touch that. I'll give you a punch that will drive you home. Get it? Yes, Mr. Shiva... that bird has flown into our cage! What! He's reached there too! - I'll put him to sleep here and now! - You will do nothing to him! He has to be kept alive; those are the boss's orders. Very well then. By the Charminar! I can't quite decide which gun I must buy! Your Charminar is now shaken, Akhtar Hyderabadi! Forget the Charminar... not a stone in Hyderabad will budge! Don't, Amar! Drop your pistol, or I'll cut this girl to pieces! Go on! Throw it! Drop your gun! Now turn around! Move now! Walk, I said! Why did you come after me? I had to kill him because of you! My efforts have all been wasted. Or I'd have... You forgot your gun in the car. I thought I'd help... - And so... - Henceforth, do as you are told! Raise your hair... Now look, Sanjana. You need not come with me from tomorrow. I think you've already got what you wanted. No... I still haven't got, what I wanted. At 9 tomorrow, then. "What's wrong with me?" "I've fallen in love" "It has been love at first sight" "I don't know how it happened... tell me, O heart" "What's wrong with me? I've fallen in love" "I lost my heart at first sight" "I fell in love" "How did it happen, I don't know; tell me, O heart" "What's wrong with me? I've fallen in love" "I possess a clean heart; I never ever knew I'd fall in love" "Do not torment me now that my passions are aroused" "I possess a clean heart... I never knew I'd fall in love" "Do not torment me now that my passions are aroused" "I hope we do nothing untoward" "What's happened to me? I seem to have fallen in love" "I lost my heart at first sight" "Every evening I miss you" "I must return before it's dawn" "Every evening I miss you" "I must return before it's dawn" "There's a whole night ahead" "Let's be together now" "What's happened to me? I've fallen in love" "How did it happen? You tell me" "How did it happen? I've fallen in love" "How did it happen to me? Tell me, my love" Well, Mr. Shiva... Ms Rani... ...your brother asked us to keep Amar alive. We did as he wished! But with Amar being alive, Raju Pandit got killed! Now tell me, till when we must sit twiddling our thumbs! Why are you rubbing salt into your wounds, Chaturvedi? There you are! It hurts, doesn't it? I've been telling you repeatedly that it's a very simple task... Kidnap his mother... bring her here. I'll handle everything else. - His mother is dead. - Then bring his father. He doesn't even have a father. He's not a "son-of-the-soil", is he? He must have some relative... someone his own! He has no one... he has no weaknesses whatsoever. One is not born with a weakness... ...it has to be created. I'll involve him in such a quagmire now... ...that no matter how much he tries, he will not be able to wriggle out! - Let's go, sonny... - Yes, Uncle. - You wait here. - Where are you going? - Upstairs... - I'm getting scared! - How can I remain here all alone? - I had asked you not to come! Now quietly sit here! And don't get scared... ...nothing will happen. Let's do this... keep this gun for your protection. If I don't return in 10 minutes, go to the police station. And don't get out of the van. Understand? No! Don't come closer! What happened? He's dead. What's this you have done? You've killed him! What will happen now? I gave you a gun to scare him off. Not to kill him! I don't know how the gun went off! - But he was attacking me! - What the hell does that mean! - He came charging at me, and... - And you opened fire?! Do you know you can be sentenced to death for murder? Save me, Amar... You know this wasn't intentional. - You know he tried to attack me... - Now let me think! - There's only one way now. - What is that? I'll take the blame. But... what will you do then? There's no other way. I'll handle it. We shouldn't wait here any more. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Here's your ticket. I got it with great difficulty. Don't worry. I'll take care of everything here. Will you be sent to prison? No. I'll claim that he was killed in an encounter. - At the most, I might lose my job. - Please try to forgive me... I'd never forgive myself if you were to be punished. I know what I'm doing. I am only worried about you. Whatever you did today is something I'll never forget. Your bag. Air India Flight Al 101 to New York is ready for take-off. Passengers are requested to proceed for their security check. You killed him. You know you can be sentenced to death for this. There is no other alternative but to take the blame myself. While lying still, I was listening to everything. As she got down from the car, she said, "please save me Amar!" And listen to what Amar says, "I will take the blame myself" And she gets emotional and says, "What will happen to you, Amar?" Which was the dialogue that scared her? "You can be sentenced to death on charges of murder" - Sanjana, listen to me... - What is there to listen now? I've heard everything. Look, I have something to explain to you. There is no need for that. I know you too well by now. By ridiculing me in front of others, you have proved that... ...you care for no one, except yourself. Even if... the other happens to be in love with you. "You have come to make a place for yourself in my heart" "You have come to make a place for yourself in my heart" "You have come to make a place in my heart: "You have now come to be my love" "You have come to make a place in my heart" "You have come to live in my heart" "You have come to be my love" "You have made a place in my heart" "You have been kind to choose me" "Even if you don't utter another word, I've heard everything" "You have come to be my love" "You have made a place in my heart" "You have made a place in my heart" "You're a deadly youth" "You have beauty that kills" "We're both drunk today... - On love" "You are now my darling" "You have come to make a place in my heart" "You have made a place for yourself in my heart" - Uncle? Is that you? - Yes, it's me. But Papa's not at home. I know that. He's gone to Poona, hasn't he? He said there was a file at home which I must collect. Please come in, Uncle. Mr. Majumdar had told me about a file... ...it is very important. Where is it lying? - Could this be the one, Uncle? - Let me see. No, this is very thin. That was a thick file. You have become very fat, too. I'm not fat at all, uncle. I hope Amar has not taken the file, has he? What do you know? What do you know! But how did you get to know? Didn't I say... ...I guess the contents of a letter from the mere look of its envelope! Okay tell me now... have you ever fallen in love? Have you done some of those kissing scenes they show on TV? - Should I talk about your wedding? - With whom? - With Amar. - With Amar? Should I propose your marriage to Amar? - Will you do that? - Why not? I'm a public-servant. It's my duty to help out. Go and telephone him now and tell him that I'd like to speak to him. Just a minute, please... Mr. Amar. It's for you. - Amar here... - Amar, this is Anjali. There is something I must talk to you about. Will you come over? - Now? At this time? - Yes... It's very important. Okay. I'll be there in an hour. - He'll be here in an hour! - Clap to that! What kind of hands to you have? So dry... ...what are you up to at college? - What are you doing? - I'm kissing it... Didn't you like it? I'll do it nicely again... Who's that? Amar? How are you? What has brought you there so late in the night? - Where's Anjali? - There's something wrong here. Please come immediately. What's wrong? Everything's fine, I hope. I can't tell you over the phone. Please come over immediately. - This is Amar Damji speaking. - Yes, sir? Reach the Commissioner's house immediately. With the finger-prints expert. - What's up, sir? - Anjali Majumdar has been murdered. - That's enough, sir. - And here you are. The move I've made this time... ...has killed the foe and not harmed me, too! - Please come with me, sir. - What's the matter? It's important. Please come along. What's wrong?! According to the report, the finger-prints belong to him. They're his finger-prints! The finger-print expert, Dr. Moghe, please present yourself! You're a renowned finger-print expert and also a doctor. Is it ever possible for one to not even touch something... ...and for his finger-prints to still be left on some objects? Not at all. Mr. Amar claims that the finger-prints found on the scene of the crime... ...are not his. He also claims that he did not touch anything there. The finger-prints found at the scene of the crime... ...and his finger-prints are the same. It's a lie! He's lying! It's not he who's lying... it's you! You're not a human-being, you're an animal! A wolf! Please testify in the Witness Box only. When I called from Poona that fateful night... ...it was none other than this man who received the call! That is what I'm trying to tell you, sir! Why would I take the call, if I were guilty? A man can lie... but his finger-prints do not lie! They cannot! It is this man who has killed her! I was going to get my daughter married to you anyway... ...then why did you do this? Why? Please believe me, sir! I'm innocent, sir! In view of the evidence available... ...this Court sentences Amar Damji, for the rape and murder... ...of Anjali Majumdar, to death. I had not expected this of you. I'm innocent, Sanjana. Whether someone believes you or not... ...but I... trust you implicitly. Take care of yourself. We'll rest only after we've killed you, Amar Damji! You thought you were very smart! You've made a mistake by provoking us! - What are you looking at? - We'll kill you! We will not spare you! We'll kill you, Inspector! Did you hear that? We'll kill you! He's come here, too. Your time is up... You've come to the right place... ...I won't spare you! Shut up! Go on... go inside. I don't want any trouble from the three of you! Well, sir, you got us caught for nothing, didn't you? He's no more a "Sir"... he's a criminal like us. ...of our own status. He'll long for his parents, just as we do! Only then will he realize the suffering of parents! These guys are cops! They don't give a damn for suffering! They only want medals... promotions... ...the world be damned! Do you think I'm working only for medals? People like you can never understand the sacrifices of the police. Because you have never even attempted to. As for the parents and family you refer to... ...they are all your own. Have you ever thought of those parents whose lives these animals... ...have destroyed? And who are still destroying it? And those who are ruining this very nation? I'm doing my work only as an Indian... ...and not for some obscure medal. In the discharge of my duties, if I have to destroy your houses... ...I will have no qualms. Stop! No one will touch him! This is the day I have waited for. Have you recognized me?! I still haven't been able to forget my brother's death! ...l'd have avenged his death on that very day... ...by pulling out the intestines from your stomach! But what could I do? I was held firmly by the men in uniform! But today... nobody will come between us. It'll only be me... and you! What had you said then? Servant, eh? A government-servant! By saving that wretched Minister... ...and by killing my brother, you've incurred my enemity! Beginning with you and that Minister, I will wipe out the government too! All three of you! Mr. Jailer! All hell's broken loose! Come quickly! Do something quickly, sir! Get out, you swines! You're always up to trouble! Get out! It's already Four... sit in the van. We've to go the quarries. Come on, leave him! Take different routes. We'll meet later in Bombay. Before that, I have to complete an unfinished task. The punk's dead! - But how did they escape? - They had a scuffle in the van... ...and the van met with an accident. Search every nook and corner of the city for them. Regardless of whether the other prisoners are found or not... ...I want Amar, in any condition. Dead or alive. You go that way. All of you disperse in different directions. Who is it? - What happened? - I've got a bullet wound. - Should I call the doctor? - No. No one should know that I'm here. May Amar Damji's soul rest in peace! And may you be booted! Address me with a little more respect. The fact that I dress modestly doesn't make me effeminate! Amar is dead; I've fulfilled my vow. Which is what you also wanted. Did you find his body? Tell them. We combed the entire hilly terrain... ...we couldn't find his body. Did you hear that? He's a Rajput. He will not die so easily. What should we do now, sir? Wear anklets on your feet... ...and dance like a nautch-girl! Go and look for him! How does it feel now? What? Your face? ...or these eyes of yours? - No, I was... - Or your lips? I was only asking about the pain. - Pain? - Yes. It has now increased. Have this. You will like it. No. I got it for you. It is said that "sharing" increases love between each other. "I wonder what's happened to me..." "ever since I saw you" "Ever since I saw you" "I have gone crazy..." "ever since I saw you" "Ever since I saw you" "This pining is perhaps love" "Love leads to desire" "I love you so much" "I'm afraid, I might lose you" "In my breath lingers your fragrance" "For you I wear kohl in my eyes" "My life is for you" "I've gone crazy..." "ever since I've seen you" "Ever since I've seen you" "You are with me" "And I am consumed by desire" "I feel like holding you in an embrace" "What magic have you worked on me?" "I'm drunk on you" "I live for you" "I've gone crazy..." "ever since I've seen you" "Ever since I've seen you" "Ever since I've seen you" Get up. Quick! Now he can't escape from here. Look for him! - Did you find him? - No. Search for him. He must be hiding somewhere around. Where are you running away? Come on! Look here; We couldn't find Amar Damji, but we got his girl. Let go of me! She must be knowing Amar Damji's whereabouts. Where is he? Where is Amar? Tell me! - I don't know! - Speak up! Don't act smart, else I'll ruin your face! - Speak up! - I'll tell you. He's gone to Dr. Modi's house. Where is Amar Damji? Amar is not here. But why do you ask? Was he supposed to come here? Okay, bitch! Where is Amar? - He was supposed to come here. - You're lying! She's speaking the truth. - What do you mean? - Amar is here... ...in front of you. Don't move! Empty the ammo from your guns, else I'll blow off Shiva's head! Empty the guns! Come on! Do as he says! You can't get away alive from here, Amar Damji. So, Amar? Calm down! You will get nothing from bloodshed. You can talk to me. Let me go! I'm innocent. Not you, it was I who was innocent. You have ruined my reputation. You will have to wash away the stigma attached to my name now. Don't hit me... l'm a very weak man. I'll die! I'm prepared to confess everything. - Do you have a vehicle? - Yes... why? Listen to me, sir. I haven't killed your daughter. Somebody else did. - He'll tell you the truth. - I will listen to nothing! Believe me, sir. Why else would I personally come to you? Tell him, how were my finger-prints found there. Mr. Commissioner... I designed Amar's finger-prints... ...at Inspectors Deshpande and Jamdade's behest. They threatened to kill me. What could I do? Look at this. They threatened to kill me. I'm innocent. Which means that Deshpande and Jamdade killed my daughter. No, sir. They were at the Police Station at that time. They haven't committed the murder; but they surely know who did it. - Yes? - What is this? Can you tell me, Deshpande? Because of you, my daughter was murdered and Amar was punished! I'll have you both hanged! You'll do nothing of that sort. Kill him! Shoot, I say! Amar Damji shot the Commissioner and Dr. Moghe. Sharma, Mohite... Come here quickly! At least no one will come here to look for you. Till when will we keep running like this, Amar? Till such time as I prove my innocence. Till I prove that I'm not the culprit, someone else is. You will not get the opportunity to prove anything. Do you know they have pasted your posters all over town? The moment you step out, either the police will kill you... ...or your enemies will gun you down! What Uncle says is true, Amar. You're also being accused for killing the Commissioner and Dr. Moghe now! I think the rat will have to be lured not with bread now... ...but with the goodies. Goodies?! I had a six-hour long meeting with officials of the Gunstorm Company. I've succeeded in knowing the names of those involved in the scandal. I want to disclose the names before the people of my nation... ...immediately on my arrival there. You people will get to know the truth too. Switch it off. - What did you say? - Switch it off! Uncle... what will happen now? This is the worst example of sadism! We can even knock him off at the airport. But what if he opens his mouth even before you get to him? There are still 24 hours for him to arrive. - But think of this... ...which is like unseasonable rain! - What is this? - Go ahead and read it. "Messrs Deshpande and Jamdade, my name is Julie..." "...and I'm capable of having you both hanged" "I have proof against the one who killed Anjali Majumdar" "You both are involved, too" "The price for the evidence is 300,000" "Come over to Kit Kat Club... - Julie Braganza" Now, who's this babe? We haven't got rid of one problem and this... Drag the bitch here by her hair! After I've dealt with her, she won't even be able to write again! Bring the bitch here! Wait a minute... All of you go with them. "Who are you? Tell us your name" "Stop making us pine, darling" "They call me Juliet in the West" "In India, they call me Laila" "In Punjab, they call me Heer" "They're all crazy about me" "Any other name?" "Lover!" "The heart sways... tell us..." "whose lover are you?" "The heart sways..." "I'm everybody's lover" "The heart sways... tell us..." "whose lover are you?" "My heart sways..." "I'm everybody's lover" "They are thousands after me... they're crazy about me" "They're after me... lusting for me" "There are thousands after me... they're crazy about me" "They're after me... lusting for me" "There are so many of them... whom will I call my lover?" "The heart sways... tell us..." "whose lover are you?" "The heart sways..." "I'm everybody's lover" "They're obsessed with my beauty" "and I drive them away" "They're obsessed with my beauty" "and I drive them away" "There are so many of them... whom do I call my lover?" "The heart sways... tell us..." "whose lover are you?" "The heart sways..." "I'm everbody's lover" "The heart sways..." "I'm everybody's lover" "Marilyn Monroe? - No" "Madonna? - No" "Madhubala? - No" "So who are you?" "Lover, I'm a lover" "My heart sways, O my heart says..." "...you're the one... you're my beloved indeed!" My heart sways, too. ...but before my feet start kicking, get lost! Have you both come by yourselves? Haven't you brought your "father"? Our fathers? They died the moment we were born! It's better to die than to be a father to people like you. Just because we're speaking to you like gentlemen, it doesn't mean... Only scoundrels enter this profession. The gentlemen keep away. And you, baldie... I know very well... ...who has raped and murdered the Commissioner's daughter. Understand? Who are you talking about? Don't waste my time. Cough up the money, else I'll telephone the Commissioner. Please don't do that. Actually, you'll have to come with us for the money. Julie will not go anywhere! The money will be brought here. Else, I'll make a call! Move a finger to dial, and we'll blow off your head! If my finger now presses your finger... ...what will happen of your head? - No... no! - Ms Julie, you'll get the money. - Come with me. - I agree, if you say so. Because you're the sensible one. Let's go. By the way, what else does your boss do beside rape and murder? You'll get to know everything. Just come along. Please come. And where is your "father"? Is this the noose then, that is going to hang me? She's a terrific dancer, sir! I see! What is your name? The name is Julie Braganza... Dancing is a hobby... ...and crushing snakes like you to death is my profession. - Miss Julie! - Yes? I'm no snake... I'm a snake-charmer. And I love playing with a she-snake like you are! - I don't follow? - Don't you really? I'll explain. - Uncle... - Shut up! This is Aunt Julie; greet her and get lost! - Greetings, aunt. - Get lost now! - But... - Get lost, I said! Will you strip on your own now... ...or will you make me do the hard work?! Will you violate my honor? I will only violate it; not distribute it! Come to me, darling... Actually, women are my weakness; Otherwise, I'm not a bad man. - Please help me! - I'm not evil. Come on! You're like a brother to me! Save me, please! You look strong and able; save me, please! Save me, Jamdade! How many people will you hide behind, dear? Please don't do anything to her, sir. Oh darling, where are you off to! Where are you going... Let me at least come in! Know something? You've found a great place to hide in! This happens to be my den! Rascal! Don't you have womenfolk back home? I do... but none like you. You're Julie, or Bruce Lee? Now come into my arms! This bed is meant to be slept on. Not danced on! Now come to me, darling! You keep jumping around and I'll get tired, okay? - Don't make me lose my temper! - Okay... I'm ready... but turn away to that side. - What! - Turn your face away, please. Oh God! She's feeling shy! Then say so! I'll turn away! May I take a look? To tell you the truth... ...this is the first time I've ever waited. I knew it when I saw you that I'd make a trip to Heaven today! Just satisfy me... ...and you will own diamonds worth Rs.1.1 billion! I've never fallen in love with a girl having an English name. The silky darkness, indeed! - Can I take a look now? - Yes. Go ahead. Your trip to Heaven begins! Shall we go now? Move! Not a soul will move! Don't move... and drop your guns! Drop them! Drop them, I said! - Hands up... - Stick them up, idiot! Drop your gun, else this girl will lose her life! Drop it! Bravo, Raghu... ...you turned the tables on him. I've never been beaten up the way you have thrashed me today! I'll deal with you now, and rob you of your speech! Uncle, listen to me... - What is it? Speak up! - Come here then. Congratulations, Mr. Amar! You've been made in-charge of Mr. Vishwasrao's security! So, there are changes in my plans of violence. Bring her here, Mr. Raghu. Will you? Now look; you love him, don't you? So ask him to do as we say. Speak up! - No... - What do you want? Good... You see, Mr. Vishwasrao is returning from America today. He'll go straight to the Government building and disclose my name. My men can't go to the airport with weapons, you see. So, I want you to shoot Vishwasrao. No... I cannot do that. It's terribly easy! All you have to do is to lift the revolver and fire! What's this you've done? Why did you kill them? Warrants have been issued in these fools' names! The Commissioner they fired at has survived! Had they been caught, I'd have been under fire! What I've done, indeed... Hurry now, there's little time... ...decide on what you will do! - I can never do this. - But she can certainly die! And before I kill her, I will... ...haven't I said women are my weakness? Make up your mind now! Okay... l'm ready to do it. Have all the arrangements been made? Yes. The plane is about to land now. Mr. Vishwasrao will be landing on Indian soil at any moment now. He brings, hidden in his heart, the name of the traitor... ...who has, for the sake of money, betrayed the nation and motherland. How are you, Amar? What is this you are doing? What punishment does the traitor merit? This is Kasim speaking. Amar has killed Vishwasrao. How can you say that the traitor does not belong to your party? - You see... - The mission is accomplished. But how did this happen? What's happened, Mr. Minister? - Why don't you tell us what's wrong? - There's bad news... Somebody has shot dead Mr. Vishwasrao at the airport. The Minister's on his way. Keep the car ready. Take them both in the jeep. Where is the girl? She's under Chaturvedi's feet. She's in the very building where the minister is now headed. And when Chaturvedi realizes that you have betrayed him... ...you don't know what treatment your beloved will go through! These traitors have pumped bullets not into the heart of Vishwasrao... ...but into the heart of Mother India herself! A decent... ...daring... ...man was Mr. Vishwasrao. - Not "was". He "is". Please be seated. The person involved in the pay-off of Gunstorm Company is none else, than... ...my deputy, Chaturvedi! But we were told that you were assassinated. Your plan was very good, Chaturvedi. But you made a mistake... You entrusted the task of killing me to a man who would die himself... ...but never betray his Motherland, like you have done. Nobody will act smart... or you're all dead-men! And you shouldn't act smart at all! Else, I'll make so many holes in your body... ...that you'll be used for a flute, even after you die! You have finished my political career. Let alone a Minister, I can't even be a peon in the administration now. That's fine; but you will help me in escaping from this place now. I concede that Amar has not betrayed his nation... ...but he has surely betrayed his lover. - Bring that girl upstairs. - Okay, sir. Are you okay? You men in uniform... ...do not try to act smart. We have the whole building under our control... ...and also about 50 journalists as hostages. Your beloved Minister Vishwasrao is also enjoying our hospitality. This is Inspector Karan Sharma, Mr. Chaturvedi... ...we have surrounded this building. Nobody can escape us now. Is that so? Have you seen enough, or do you wish for some more? Listen carefully now, to what I say... ...no one will enter this building now. My nephew will go to my house to fetch the diamonds. He will not be stopped by anyone of you. We need a helicopter to go to the airport... ...where an aircraft should be arranged... ...to fly us out of the nation. Do you understand? I've listened to your demands. But I can't fulfill them. Agree to his demands, Karan! My seniors are not present here right now. Why don't you speak to Karan on this walkie-talkie? If I do that, Chaturvedi will know that I'm in the building... ...and I don't want that at any cost! Tell them to do as I say. Go on. I cannot do that. Chaturvedi and some terrorists have taken over the building. We don't know how far they have spread in the building. But they're holding Mr. Vishwasrao and VIPs to ransom on the top floor. Why are you playing with the lives of innocent people? Speak to them... go on, or should I throw someone else now? Do just as they are asking you to do. To arrange the helicopter and the aircraft will take us an hour. Not more than 30 minutes! If you're any later than that, I'll throw people out of the window! - Not more than 30 minutes! - Okay, we'll do our best. Why isn't the babe here? Go and take a look. - And nephew... - Uncle? Go home and bring the diamonds here. Do you get it? - The cops there... - They'll treat you like a prince! Speak up! - What was that? - That's Bitta's voice! What's wrong with him? - Harishankar and Bitta... - What's happened to them? Their corpses... they've been killed by someone. - The girl's missing too. - Who could have done this? This could only be his doing. Listen... I know you've entered this building. If you don't come here in 10 minutes... ...l'll kill them all, one by one. Do you hear me? ...That's okay. I'll start the good work with Mr. Vishwasrao's P.A. Could you hear that? Will you come here now, or should I play some more "music"? Look for him through out the building. Get going! Killing that rascal is no child's play! Now either do something yourself, or kill me instead! Keep this... Check out your guns. You stay here. Nobody can harm you here. Come out in the open, Amar Damji! - We know you're here! - Come out! You won't escape, you swine! You've dared to kill our friends. We'll finish you! Why hasn't the helicopter arrived? It should be here in 15 minutes. Why hasn't my nephew returned? Try tricks... ...and I'll fling all of them out of here! No! He should be here at any moment. Only one of us will survive today! Lt'll either be you, or me! Come out! Step out. You're alright, aren't you? - But I'm worried about Amar. - Don't worry. He'll be alright. Uncle! I've brought it! - I've got it! - Wonderful, my son! You've acted like the true son of my sister! How they glitter! It's the whole lot, isn't it? The whole lot indeed! It's already 30 minutes, Mr. Commissioner... ...but I still can't see your helicopter. Try any tricks and I'll throw them all out of the window! Don't do that! The helicopter is on its way here. All of you go down, but take the stairs! Clobber the rascal! Kill him! What happened? Get out. How do you know that name which I had given up 17 years ago? Because, before you did that, you killed two people. - Who were they? - Inspector Damji Kanwar Rathod... ...and Shanti Rathod. I still remember my mother's screams. ...and the sound of her breaking bangles. I haven't forgotten. The father whose finger I held while I walked... ...the mother in whose arms I snuggled comfortably... ...you snatched them both away from me. Forgive me! I admit that I killed your parents. Look at these diamonds! Worth a 1.10 million! We'll share them! Take the whole lot of it! I beg of you... Please don't kill me. I am still your Deputy Minister! You're a cop! You cannot kill me. I surrender myself to you. You're a cop... You cannot kill me! You bloody cur! You are unfortunate that you heard only your mother's screams... Your father's cries were really worth listening to when his... ...stomach was cut open and his intestines were dumped in the gutters. Start singing the National Anthem. Your end has come. As usual, you've won.
