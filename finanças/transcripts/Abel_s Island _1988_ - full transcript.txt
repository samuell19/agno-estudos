(upbeat woodwind music) (upbeat woodwind music) (clock ticks) (upbeat woodwind music) (cloth rustles) (upbeat violin music) - [Abel] It was early in August of 1907. The day Amanda and I went for a picnic in the woods. (bright music) The sky was overcast, but we thought it couldn't be so inconsiderate as to rain when we were in the mood for an outing. (mallet and ball clunks) (Abel's laughter) - Oh, delicious caviar! (crunching noises) - Mmmmmm. Try one of these quail eggs. - Amanda had crawled under a fern to read, and I decided to go off by myself for a bit. (bright music) Oh, perfect parasol for Amanda! [Abel] Um, I have something for you. - It's raining! - Indeed it is! (wind howling) (crowd shouting) (wind blowing) - [Abel] We made it! (wind gusts) - Abel! Abel! (perilous music) (branch snaps) (percussion music) (percussion music) (water rushing) (percussion music) (wind blowing) (percussion music) (calm water flowing) - Heeellllllllllloooooooooooooooooooooo! - [Abel's Voiceover] I soon realized that I was the only living creature on the island. They're all wondering where I am, of course. It's certainly got around that Abelard Hassam di Chirico Flint of the Mossville Flints is missing. (sighs) I do wish I had something to eat. A mushroom omelette, for example, with buttered (sniffs) garlic toast. (chomping) Cherry birch, it's not bad, really. - [Abel Voiceover] While eating, I became convinced that I had the strength, the courage, and the intelligence to survive. (water flowing) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (intense music) (sniffs) - The question is, how to get home? It would be impossible to reach the far shore by swimming, the current is far too strong. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (fluttering music) (birds chirping) Ehhhhhhh.... ohh, a rudder! That's what I need! That would be bending the power of the stream to my own ends! (water flowing) (screaming) (water splashing) (upbeat music) (chomping on branch) (upbeat music) (crashing into rock) (splashing) (water rushing) Oh, this stupid island! But what am I to do? Build a bridge? A tunnel? Where are my friends? Why haven't they enough sense to rescue me? It's all getting quite boring. If only I could be back in my own house, surrounded by my books and comfortable chairs, and Amanda. (chimes ringing) You see my predicament. (chimes ring) - [Woman's Voice] I see. - What shall I do? - [Woman's Voice] You will do what you will do. (chimes ringing) (thuds on the ground) - [Abel's Voiceover] I awoke to learn that I actually had been falling. It sickened me to see the river in the pale, early morning light. (water flowing) I decided to make a long rope. With the rope, I could pull myself across the river. It would have to be strong, yet light enough so that I could sling it across to the other side. - Oh, by now the whole town must be looking for me! (upbeat music) Finally, it's finished. (creaking) (water splashing) (whirring) (water splashing) (happy string music) - [Abel's Voiceover] I had begun to run out of ideas as to how to make my escape, and so, in the days and weeks that followed, I began to develop... (sigh) patience. (water flowing) (happy chime music) (knocking) (happy chime music) (footsteps) Drugged with the aroma of rotting wood, I lost consciousness. I dreamed all night of Amanda. We were together in a garden, something like the island, and full of flowers. What was marvelous about this dream, was that I knew I was dreaming, and certain that Amanda was dreaming the very same dream, at the same time. It felt as though we were as close to each other as we were in the solid world. (light chime music) (crickets chirping) (Abel humming) (fire crackling) Home-grown, cooked vegetables tasted so much better, especially when flavored with onions and garlic. I made my pots and paper-thin bowls out of the reddish clay at the lower end of the island. The clay also inspired me to try my hand at making something just for its own sake, something beautiful. One day, I made a statue of Amanda. Of course, it didn't really resemble her, so I tried again, and then, what I had was real enough to embrace. Then came dear old mother and father, then my brother and sister. (instrumental music) (rain falling) Whoever finds this, please forward it to my wife, Amanda Flint, 89 Bank Street, Mossville. Dearest angel, I am alive! I am alone on an island about 12,000 tails long, located below a great waterfall. Do not worry, but send help. My utmost and entire love, Abel. (happy chime music) At night, I dreamed of Amanda, and so, got the idea that perhaps I could reach her during my waking hours as well. Sitting in my tree, I would project my thoughts, feelings, questions, in the direction of home. Sometimes I felt that I could hear Amanda responding with messages or her own. I became convinced I could fly to my wife through the air. (determined string music) (determined strings music) (Abel moaning and screaming) (thudding into the ground) I lay there for several hours, brokenhearted and dazed with pain. One day, in November, I made an exciting discovery. The island was known to civilized creatures. (grunting) (jumps to the ground) (pages turning) - Fascinating! - [Abel's Voiceover] It was wonderful to have a long book to keep me company. I decided to read a chapter each day. It made me wistful for my normal life. (rustling through grass) (banging) I realized the creatures who knew this island, might return. I would have to leave signs all about, to make my presence known. So I made clay tablets and placed them in well-chosen parts of the island. (twisting gears) I had no need for the time, (clock ticking) but I did need the ticking, the sound, so different from the roaring and gurgling of the river, the wailing and whining of the wind, made me feel connected to the civilized world from which I had come. (instrumental music) Suddenly, one night, a winged shadow blackened out the stars. (wings flapping) (thudding sound) (intense chime music) (claw swiping) (wings flapping) (intense chime music) (thudding on ground) (wings flapping) (bird screaming) (thudding on ground) (intense chime music) That night I considered battling him on my roof with my knife, but instead I fell asleep. After my encounter with the owl, I was extremely wary for a long time, even in full daylight, when owls are expected to sleep. The environment no longer seemed altogether friendly. (birds chirping) (intense music) - Fowl owl, ugly you, you'll never get me, whatever you do! You cannot hurt me, you cannot kill, you're in my power, I have your quill! (intense music) - [Abel's Voiceover] Now where on Earth did that come from? (wind howling) I had to prepare for the winter. I made myself a pair of snowshoes, and a winter cape which I wove from grassys and milkweed. (wind howling) (snow crunching) It was asleep, but its erect posture like that of a sentinel of hell, and its eyes, which even shut seemed to stare, filled me with dread. (wind howling) - Amanda, I will see you again! I just don't yet know how. (chime music) (pages turning) (Abel laughing) That's awfully good! (laughing) (snow crunching) (chime music ringing) (scuffling) You coward! Come on down and do battle! Bird, reptile, fiend, or whatever kind of villain you are! Down with unsightly devils! Down with evil of any sort! (bird caws) - I wish the owl's feathers would all turn to lead! So that it would fall on its head from the tallest tree, and its beak would rot and become useless, even for eating mush! I wish that it would fly into a dragon's mouth! I wish... I wish... I wish I could be away from this island, this owl, this cold, drafty log. (angrily growls) (wind howling) - [Abel's Voiceover] In January, I spent most of the time indoors, where there was a great blizzard. My chief occupation in these days was finding the nuts and sunflower seeds that I kept in the storeroom. (shaking and groaning) It went on for weeks. I could hardly tell day from night, because almost no light got in through the tightly shuttered windows. (chipper music) Then, one day, I awoke to discover that things were visible. How unspeakably beautiful even the shells on the floor, how vividly actual, and therefore marvelous! Amanda! Dear heart! What a lovely day! (upbeat music) I have to go on believing in you, but living is more than remembering, imagining. I need the real you by my side. (instrumental music) - [Abel's Voiceover] The January blizzard was just a prelude. A fire would have been wonderful, but I was afraid of burning my house in the process. So instead, I donned my entire wardrobe, and quilted myself with whatever mats and padding I could find in the storeroom. I felt sick. The only source of warmth was my own body. In February, in a coma of coldness, I sometimes felt that I was the only, lonely, living thing that existed. (upbeat chime music) (wind howls) (ominous music) (wind howling) (birds chirping) Sometime in March, I felt I was thawing out. (happy music) Any by April, the whole world was suffused with green. But it was in May that I went completely crazy. (splash) (incoherent yodeling and yelling) (soft music) (birds chirping) (grunting and struggling) - Gosh almighty. (splashing) I never thought I'd make it! (gasping) Did I have a time with that waterfall. (giggling) I thought I'd drown! Gower Glackens is the name. Who might you be? Where am I? - Um, you're on an island, and you're talking to Abelard Hassam di Chirico Flint, for short, Abel. - Pleased to meet you! Imagine someone my age with all my years of experience letting himself get into that kind of water. Spring fever, I suppose. I'm always a little batty after lying in the cold mud all winter. Where is this, anyway? Is there a town here? A post office? Any boats? - No, there's only me. Sorry. - Don't be sorry. I'd rather find you than no one. Why are you here? - I came the same way you did... Against my will. Let's go to my house. (bright music) (lips smacking) - Thanks, I needed that. (tin cup ringing) - Gower! - Who, what, where am I? Oh, (laughing) it's you. - [Abel's Voiceover] Gower and I remained together until June. Although he was always forgetting things, we became fast friends. (clay plopping) - Uh, could you raise your chin a bit higher? Thank you. - What was your profession, Abel? - I haven't found my vocation, yet. The only real work I've ever done has been here, on this island. - Holy bloater, what did you live on? - My mother has provided for me, actually. - What? Well you don't look it. - One usually dresses better than this. (upbeat music) - Holy blllloater! It's me alright! It's more me than what I see in the mirror! It's a work of art, that's what it is! I think you've found your true calling. - [Abel's Voiceover] I've never imagined. Could I seriously consider myself an artist? (instrumental music) When Gower had regained his strength, he prepared to leave the island. - How I hate to see you go. - I, I hate to go. - Then don't! - My family! - I'm your family. - You're a mouse! - Oh, yes, I understand. - I wish I could carry you, but I'll have enough trouble making it myself. - You could carry a rope across for me. - That doesn't make any sense. The rope would have to be thousands of lily pads long. Having it attached to me would give me a heart attack. - But you will come back with rescuers, won't you? - As sure as shooting. - And you will go to Mossville and get in touch with my wife? - Wife? - [Abel] I've told you about her many times! - (stuttering) Of course, I remember. (water running) Oh, but why grieve. It's only temporary. That's a great statue you made of me. It'll be in a museum some day, I'll bet you. Well meet again, you'll see. (water splashing) - Farewell. Good Gower. (slow, sad music) (chimes ring) I'm lonesome. - [woman's voice] So am I. (chimes) - [Abel's Voiceover] Summer progressed. I kept busy working on anything I could to keep steadily occupied. (birds chirping) I was achingly certain that Gower had forgotten me. (birds chirping) (water running) In the hugging heat of July, I was struck with a new, most exciting possibility. For weeks, it hadn't rained, and the river looked a bit slower, a mite shallower. I dared to hope that the short, dry spell would continue into a drawn out drought, and that the river would get low enough to risk swimming across. (water running) (birds chirping) I was right! One morning, in August... - I'm coming home! (splashing in water) (instrumental music) (splashing in water) (hopeful instrumental music) (hopeful instrumental music) (splashing in water) (bright instrumental music) - [Abel's Voiceover] My thoughts were full of the future. Oh, Amanda! Then I began to have disturbing apprehensions. Would she be at home? Had things changed? What if, believing me dead, she had married another? Many mice had been in love with her. Was she even alive? If only the rain would stop. (tin clanking) (cat meowing and hissing) In the light of morning, I took my bearings. With luck, I would be in Mossville in less than a day. I would be seeing her again, my heart pounded with dreadful anxiety. (light chattering) There she was, Amanda, near enough for me to touch. No, we had waited a year, our reunion should be ours alone. (upbeat instrumental music) (door closes) (upbeat music) - Abel. Abel, oh dear Abel, it's you! It's really, really you! - Um, I brought back your scarf. (giggles) (intense instrumental music) (upbeat instrumental music)
