I mean, don't they use common wisdom Anyway, um... you said you wanted to talk to me about something last night Um... Don't worry. We'll talk about it later Alright. Well, I'll see you later after work Ah, ah. Are you just going to leave without kissing your wife goodbye? I haven't brushed my teeth - So who is infertile? You or him? - Ah, ah.. Cynthia, what kind of question is that? How rude? Girl, we are family! Who else you gonna keep it real with? Besides, I'm only echoing what everyone else has been asking. Who's everyone else? Can I get a glass please? Yes, Queen Cynthia! Ah You better recognize. So, who's everyone else? You know, I'm really feeling this mini kitchen Really? Is that right? Yeah, it's like a life-sized dollhouse Well, you know I've always wanted one of those dollhouses ever since we were kids Yeah you could practically reach for anything from one spot And that's the beauty of living in a life-sized But Cynthia, who is everyone else? So you haven't been receiving any pressure from your mom? My mom is everyone else? Come on Come on, you know how it is when you've been married over nine months with no baby and no belly. I mean how long have you been married anyway? five years? Three! Well that's well over nine months Can the nice Cynthia please come out and play now? You don't think I'm being nice right now? Anyway, for your information, neither one of us is infertile We're just waiting until the right time to bring our baby into this world Okay... I know whose idea that was... Oh Cynthia, please... Seriously though, can I just... Can I just be honest with you for one moment? It's that even possible? Wow... That was a dirty play. Okay But I'ma be a good sport. I'm gonna let it slide this time. You know I love you, right? Bro, can I hold something? Yes... You can hold your own pocket Bro, there's nothing there to hold. Just look and see how dry it is... Man, It feels like harmattan. Ah... Ima, wait a minute yes? Are we not working the same job, with overtime hours? Plus you're the bachelor... Yes? Why is it that you're always the one asking for money. Bro, Nosa, it's not rocket science Look, between sending money back home and money for rent payment, there's barely any money left for food; not to mention transportation costs But I have already told you You need to cut your coat according to your size. I guess you have figured me out. I guess, I'm a tailor... Sit there and crack jokes. Ah... I hope you know comedians in Nigeria are making some serious money... Just in case you want to do this comedy thing Look, I'm not interested in comedy. I'm just a very funny person I hear you. Exactly Anyway yes? You need to give up that big apartment and... move out of that expensive neighborhood. You can go to a smaller apartment or even rent like a studio or something Ah! Studio?! What's wrong with you? I am not feeling that studio idea Why? I'm not yet married And? I intend to marry up in life. I need that apartment to serve as leverage for the kind of woman I'm searching for No top notch woman, with class and self-respect would be interested in pulling with a guy who's unable to pull his own weight Do you understand what I'm trying to say? So, she will be marrying your apartment? Come on bro... Okay, let's be real! You are very lucky Not a lot of women are like Efosa As a matter of fact, she's one in a million I've never met any other woman willing to downgrade inside a marriage What?! So, I am a downgrade? Is this your way of indirectly insulting me? Why? why would you say such a thing? I'm only paying your wife a complement I was Just hailing her. Look, you can tell that she's tasted the good side of life... At least, before things fell apart in our country. Perhaps, it was fate bringing both of you together I doubted she'd have seen or considered you if her father's wealth didn't plummet. Sometimes, that's a blessing in disguise Because, I believe it's those humbling circumstances that formed such a strong, beautiful character in her. So yes, I'm reaping the blessing or rather the blessings Look, Ima, let me tell you something There are good women out there but you'll never find them if you're trying to be someone or something or not If a woman follows you for your possessions, she'll just end up despising you. I'm telling you Yes, Master Sensei You speak with the knowledge of the praying mantis Okay, Mr. Comedian! Ah. Come on, can"t you take a joke? Sorry But on a serious note, I hear you I'll take your advice really? Yeah I'll move out of my apartment and I'll look for a cheaper solution As a matter of fact, actually... I have a great idea... Really Yeah So, I can move in with you guys... and we can split the rent three ways. What do you think about that? You have lost you mind. Are you drunk? You must have used alcohol as mouthwash. Idiot! My friend, you better move into that little security booth Chill out, ah... Don't go find your own apartment Something is wrong with you... Look, I have a big house back home, for your information Big house? Yet you borrow money every day... You're not ashamed... You have to be your brother's keeper. Why are we friends? What kind of friends? Do I know you? We are only coworkers Don't talk like that I don't know you like that. Go and find your own apartments You're not ashamed? Your mates are making babies and you're here borrowing money from me. Comedian... You better go sell some tickets... You keep living the cheap life... Keep living the cheap life! But who's is borrowing money now? Cheap life? Look at your life... Ain't you a professional borrower? Okay you win, I agree... By the way, you still owe me... Okay, Please calm down... You win Okay, how about we put your honesty to test? Okay, go ahead. Are you happy? - Am I happy? - Ah, ah... It's English I spoke Yes My honesty meter is detecting some conflict with your answer Your honesty meter is broken Whatever Okay, so tell me this If you could do it all over again, Would you still choose Nosa over Desmond? I can't believe I'm even entertaining this O please, believe it, and answer, honestly. You're basically asking me if I would still pick love over comfort I don't mind comfort... Oh believe me, there are days when I so wish that money wasn't an issue But, at the end of the day, I'd still pick love above all See, I think in some ways you're wrong Yeah? Yeah, you equate Nosa to love and Desmond to money That is a faulty equation I mean, the way I see it, Nosa is love without money and Desmond is love with money I know... I've seen how madly in love with you he was The guy was lovesick. No lie! But I wasn't in love with him That doesn't matter he is a young, rich, handsome prince and in love with you You know, that is every woman's dream! Prince? That's a little bit of a stretch His father is a chief! Anyway, he has princely money. Why don't you go and marry him then. It's not me he wants. Anyways, did you see what he bought his current girlfriend? A new convertible Benz I saw it on IG I guess he finally found love after all That car is fine! Babe that could have been you. I'm happy with Nosa I've told you. Nosa is my soulmate My best friend! I couldn't imagine going on this journey called life without him That is why for richer or for poorer, in good times and in bad times, love is what makes life special You sound like an old R&amp;B song Really. Yes! I am the champion! You're no champion. That was pure luck! Luck?! Excuse me! That was pure mathematical genius! Is that so? Yes and if you're looking for an excuse, blame those oversize fingers of yours What?! These? Oversize fingers? Yeah? You wanna see oversize fingers? Nosa! You wanna see oversize fingers? Nosa! Nosa! No! Nosa! Please No! No! Nosa! Nosa! Stop it! Nosa! No! Can you believe the delivery guy just left Mr. Edward's package on the sidewalk? Good think this is not our last neighbor. It would have disappeared by now. Remember when you ordered that small camera? Please don't remind me. Did you at least ring the doorbell? I don't need one more person asking me for anymore money. You know he can just come downstairs and knock on the door, right? You're so sure he's going to raise the rent. It's been over two years. Believe me, he's trying to give us a heads up. Maybe he's trying to invite you to church Nah. He already knows the answer to that Busy, busy, busy! No time for God. What?! Is that the pot calling the kettle black? I am neither a pot or a pothead. Thank you very much. In fact, the Bible says I am a saint. Okay, saint Efosa, show me where in the Bible it says you need to go to church to get to heaven That's not fair. Why don't you go to the church and ask the pastor? No need for that. He can't find it either. Because it's not there You know, I really miss the days when we used to go to church together Very encouraging And you were a lot more positive Well, I guess I'm too negative for you now, Saint Efosa. Come and lay down next to me I want a baby I think it's time The pressure is getting to you. It's not that. My biological clock is ticking Seriously? I thought we had to plan. What's about nursing school? You still have what... two years left? Babe I'll be almost 30 by then My mother had me at 34... Her last born in her 40s Did you seriously just make your mother the standard? All I'm saying is, 29 is still pretty young Even your mother won't give me rest, if we haven't had a baby in a year So, it's the pressure from our parents that's getting to you It's not! Babe We have a plan Let's just stick to it. It's not the pressure from our parents Yes it. It's not the pressure from our parents! I hate it when you do that! What?! When you try and tell me how I feel. I just told you it's nothing to do with our parents and you still insist Gosh, I hate that! Sorry Why don't you just let me tell you how I feel and listen to me? I said I'm sorry. Okay. Go ahead, talk I'm listening Stop over-reacting. You see? You see? there you go again. Oh come on, what now? Ah... You know what? I don't feel like talking anymore. Seriously? You're just going to leave me here just like that? Efosa! Leave me alone Efosa! Efosa! Now police say a group of men randomly beat a 39 year old man to the ground and rubbed him. How are you doing? Sorry mammy, I didn't want to shock you or anything That's okay Listen, I think my mother likes you I know she can't talk, but I can tell You know, I like you too. I didn't like the other Aide. She was too stuck-up and had an attitude. But you don't Even if you're far more prettier than her You know, I don't see a lot of African women that pretty. What part you're from? Wakanda? I know it's not a real place but check this out; If you were a queen, what kinda queen you would be? My kinda Queen! Get the joke? Wa kinda queen... Ma kanda queen I get it. So wait, is he getting physical with you? No, it's not that. So, then like what? Is he asking you out to dinner, on a date, or something like that? No, it's just Constant compliments. Compliments? Mira please! I wish somebody would be complimenting me all day I'ma send my boyfriend to him Trust me, this is not the sort of man you want your boyfriend around He has this weird vibe. He's just very weird and creepy My guts just don't agree with him Well, remember what they said in training... Sometimes, you gotta trust your gut. I know. And that's my dilemma Can I really ask them to transfer me because my guts don't agree with the son of my clients? I don't know. Plus, you know how long it took them to give me this reassignment That'll be like the third one in less than two months I don't know. Anyway Good afternoon sir Hello Nosa. You were just on my mind Thank you. I've been meaning to talk with you It's about your rent First of all, let me say how pleased I am to have you guys as my tenants It honestly feels more like family living downstairs And I especially want to thank you for how you've been voluntarily taking the garbage out for the house on pickup days. That has been such a relief for me That's okay. It's not a problem sir. So, you know your two-year lease is ending next month. And as that, a renewal usually comes with an increase in rent However, I have a proposal for you, if you're interested okay I was thinking, if you could help with the house maintenance, things like Mowing the lawn regularly or blowing the leaves. Shoveling the snow during winter Things of that nature. I'm thinking, I can knock $150 off your monthly rent okay I'll knock off $200 Yes, yes! Yes, I'll do it! Great. We have a deal. Thank you sir What are these for? They're for Cynthia. She left them here. She came here? You didn't mention that to me Is she forbidden from visiting? Oh come on, you know I feel about her. Well, she's family, and she happens to be one of my closest friends. Yeah. Very arrogant and snobbish friend. She's human. We all have flaws. Well, don't worry, once we make millions you won't have to wash your clothes anymore We can just hire servants just for that I don't have a problem washing my own clothes Well, if I had my own way, I wouldn't want my wife to lift a finger I've been thinking about this baby thing I know how much it means to you You don't have to do me any favors Oh come on, I'm really trying here Sorry I'm sorry for not hearing you I don't know, maybe... Maybe I'm the one who's not handling the pressure well I know you family didn't think you were making the right choice marrying me in fact if not for this visa lottery, I wouldn't have stood a chance You knew where I stood Yes, I know but I don't know if as a man I could have asked you to make such sacrifice to marry into such poverty I will always be grateful to God for coming through so timely. So, you know my expectations were very high leaving Nigeria to come to America But, sometimes it just feels like Like God just did me this one big favor and was like, you're on own from here. Oh, that's not true. I'm not saying it is I'm just saying how I feel. And you accuse me of not listening to you Please Continue, I'm listening. We've been in this country for over three years I expected that by we'll be doing way better than this I expected that by now we'll have something to show for the amount of time spent And on the other hand, the financial responsibilities is enough stress for someone to just want to run and go back home I mean, we could be living in a better and bigger apartment than this but I've to subject you to this dungeon, just to save money for dependents that are not even my own children It's a sacrifice that I'm gladly making And please don't call my house a dungeon again. My bad You know, the fact that we're able to help take care of so many people is a huge accomplishments Do you think that if we were back home, and you had finished school, even if you had gotten a job as a civil servant, that you'd be able to do the same thing? I know there's a lot of pressure But it's not coming from me Don't you ever wish for better circumstances? Of course sometimes it gets really hard, especially in the Winter But even on the worst days, you're the one that helps me on... You give me hope. So let me ask you this Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you married Desmond? Yes I've wondered. But, I've never wished it Did you hear about the death of my friend, Edun? Yes. Sorry for the loss. What a tragedy Isn't it? Simple illnesses that should be irrelevant, is just claiming lives over there What sort of a country is that? You know what that country needs? Young, educated minds, with proper vision Yes These recycled leaders are old, and have lost their vision, if they ever had one. Can you imagine that in this Era, they still don't have stable electricity? Ha! Please give us young innovators! Look at how our young Artists are making waves on a global level That's only parts of the solution What we really need are leaders with a heart, True with love and compassion for the people Exactly! I mean, anyone can get a degree; even the devil is very educated Ha! Nosa for president O please, I'm not at all interested. I hope you see this? can you see it? This is one of the major issues with our citizens Everybody complains, but nobody wants to step forward to make change Go and sit down! Efe, I'm boiling Eggs. You want some? No my love, I don't want to be late for work I'm leaving One of these days that'd soon be a nurse's uniform Ah! Amen Listen, I have some plans I want to run by you I think you'll actually favor them Really? Yes Later. I thought they said you're not allowed to wear jewelry at work What? Oh... um, I don't think they meant wedding rings. Oh, okay. Alright enjoy your day I'm not going back to that assignment... No way! What?! What?! No! That's not true! He tried to rape me! He tried to rape me So, like I said, I've been really thinking about how to make this baby plan work So, I've been doing some major research and I think I have a solid plan So, just a few days ago I ran into Stanley. He used to work at Brilliant Security Guards... Remember the one I used to work with before? So we're catching up and I discover he's no longer working security. He's now doing taxi And I can just see cause, funny enough, the time we were working together, we used to brainstorm the idea of taxi and, coincidentally, I run into him on the block I mean, is that a confirmation or what? Man... Listen... If I put in the time I put in security into taxi, Especially if I own my own car, huh! O girl, my love, this is a major hit! We can even start shooting for the baby sooner than planned. I'm thinking like... October, November, you know, after a fall semester... That way we'll be expecting by summer break See I told you I really put some serious thought into this Come on, you're not saying anything So what do you think? Um... It sounds interesting Interest? Oh... Okay... Okay, you're worried about the financial aspect, right? Okay. Look, this whole taxi plan will run us a little over... Like $5,000... That's including the fees, TLC license, documents, insurance... And even down payment for financing a new car So, how are we going to get the money? Okay. Well, already we're saving for the fall semester... that's not due till, what? October, right? So, I mean if I start doing the taxi, We can raise the money by like, August ending. I mean, I'll still be doing my security hours Just less hours; not too much, so I can still - That's only $2,000 Just hold on... wait, wait, wait first. Just... Hear the whole plan, okay? Um... Okay so... if I double up on my hours, I'll talk to my Supervisor... That shouldn't be a big problem You can still maintain your same hours Overtime is not necessary Unless you want to... I mean, that could always help. But I think, between both our checks we can raise like... let's see... $4,000 by August... And, yeah, hopefully if this new assignment goes steady before the end of summer, we can do that. You don't think it'll work. Babe, Seriously, I've been really thinking about this I mean, even running into Stanley, isn't... Isn't that like a sign? It's not that No? Then what? Babe, what's wrong? What's wrong? What happened? Babe, what happened? It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay... It's okay... What's going on? Sorry. I should have told you. I just didn't want to add more stress to your plate Sorry for what? You have nothing to be sorry about That bastard is going to be so sorry... I swear! That's another reason why I didn't tell you Just... Let it go, please. I've already filed a police report. I can't believe he also filed a police report. How dare he?! Nosa, let it go The truth will come out I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. Nosa, please don't do that If you didn't have to work, this would have never happened No! Stop it! Don't do that to yourself. This has nothing to do with that I don't want you to work anymore. Why? I'll request more hours. Don't worry, we'll be fine. No. I want to work... I'm going to work Please. Please... Let's not argue over this I need you to respect my decision as your husband It's very important to me. Please Where is the stupid paper? What are you looking for? It's a telephone number I wrote on a piece of paper and I put it in my wallet. Oh... I hate when this happens! Ah! Maybe try checking your wallet. Okay... Okay... Don't kill me I'm assuming you think you left it in your pants. Okay Why don't you try checking in the top drawer of your night stand? Why don't you just help me look for it... instead of asking me a thousand questions? Boss, please don't be upset. I'm just trying to help. Whenever I do laundry, I normally check your pockets and take whatever I find out, and put it in the top drawer of the nightstand. That's why I'm asking Boss, please don't be angry... but why is this number so important anyway? My field supervisor, Tunde, travelled about two weeks ago and we have this new guy covering for him. He's acting really shady. He doesn't want to give me any hours. He's acting like it's his father's company or something. Anyway, before Tunde left, he gave me his telephone number And he's close with the owner. So I want to reach out to him and see if he can put in a word for me You know how much we really need this. It's not there. I don't understand What about safety? So, you're saying, you can't place me because he filed a police report? Really? Two months wait... On another note, I know you've heard Heard what? Come on... You know what I'm talking about It's trending all over social media Desmond? So you have heard. Isn't that crazy? First of all, it's not trending... But you still managed to hear Do I smell, some sort of interest in other people's affairs? You... Shamelessly posted it all over IG Ah ah... Why do you get so much pleasure from people's pain? Oh please... You make it sound like somebody died They only broke up, for crying out loud Or, should I say, he broke up with her So you don't see any pain there? What? Of course there's pain. But, that's a part of life. She'll get over it Plus, it's probably best for her anyways Cynthia you're cold... Ah come on, you know that's not true. I have insights. I'm speaking intelligently. What kind of insights? Oh, I thought you were not interested... Cynthia, if you don't talk right now, I'll jump over this table and strangle you... Ah... My sister, violence is never the answer Come on, tell me... He broke up with her because he doesn't love her What?! mmhmm yep. And I commend him for that It shows honesty and integrity... He didn't even asked for the car back Wow... So how did you know he wasn't in love with her? He told me He told you? Exactly what I just said As in, he spoke to you on the phone? Why do you sound so surprised? We talk. Why would he be sharing intimate aspects of his relationships with you? Ah ah... Like I said, we talk. And quite often. How come you never told me this before? Efosa, you are a happily married woman I thought such things wouldn't interest you Yeah, I know, but still... Don't forget I knew him before you. I practically introduced you both Because I saw this dazzling potential But you shut it down Was I supposed to banish him for my friendship? So, you guys have been in touch all this while? Well, we maintained our friendship And you talk often? Well, in different seasons... Look, I'll put it this way We may not talk for a while, but when we do, we just pick up where we left off. He's that cool. Now who's got a special interest in him? Oh no, no, no... and definitely not on his part In fact, you would be quite interested to find out the real reason why he broke up with his girlfriend. Even though he did tell me in confidentiality... real reason? But you said it was because he wasn't in love with her anymore. True... But that's because he's still in love with somebody else... Who? What? Stop! Honest to god. You're it baby. No... Please be serious... I'm serious... I'm not kidding! Look, Desmond was in love with you, that deep. Okay? He said he will not marry another woman unless he feels that kind of love. His exact words. Cross my heart. Nosa: Okay, okay. So do you know anyone that might have his number? I already asked him. He said he doesn't have it. Anyway, do you know when he's scheduled to come back to work? What? That's almost two months from now! Okay, okay, okay... Bye. Bye. Ah.. What kind of stuff is this now? Five thousand dollars! Honey I almost fainted. Ah! I knew she was going to help us. But I thought she was going to give us two, maybe five hundred dollars at most. When I saw that extra zero on that check? I couldn't believe it! Ha! This is the wildest thing that has happened to us in a long time! Wow! Cynthia! Wow! Ah! Ah! Life is so unpredictable at times Ah! I appreciate her thoughtfulness. This is like a dream I know! But... We can't accept this. What? I just wish you politely refused initially. Now it's just going to be really awkward when we have to give it back What are you talking about? You're joking... You almost had me. I'm not joking. I'm very serious. Nosa To be honest, I'm kind of disappointed in you Nosa, what... What are you talking about? Is that what you do? Going running around, to talk to Cynthia about our personal struggles? Nosa, Ha! By now, the whole town must have heard They must be thinking, Wow, I can't even take care of my wife Oh they warned you, but you won't listen. I won't be surprised if there's a song that comes out in the next few days about this tragedy! What a foolish girl! She chose a beggar over a Prince! Nosa, what are you talking about? I don't know what's going on with you, but you better snap out of it No! You're the one that needs to snap out of it! I will be damned if I allow Cynthia make a mockery of me or you, for that matter! Is that what this is about? Your pride? Did you ask her or did she volunteer it? What? You heard me! Nosa, I've already told you. I was Just as shocked as you are when she gave it to me So, why would she offer to help you if you didn't go crying or running to her? How did she know the exact amount we talked about? She didn't put your name on the check. She wrote mine in bold! Nosa, I've never known you to be this Petty Alright, go ahead. Insult me. disrespect me I have always given you the utmost of respect If that is the case, respect my decision now! Henceforth, you cannot discuss our personal affairs or issues with her. Call her, first thing in the morning, and let her know our decision! I will gladly call her! In fact, I'll call her tonight just show me something. Give me another $5,000 check... or 4000... You know what, I'll even takes $3,000 Something! Just something that justifies this pride of yours. I may not be rich, but I have self-respect and nobody will ever take that away from me Nobody! No Not you, and definitely, not Cynthia! This is not self-respect Nosa This is pride! Pride! And you want to kill us with it! Not with hunger but with pride! Ah ah! I know men who have way more money way more self-respect, that have sunk to their knees and thanked God for a lot less! What you need to do, Nosa, is call her and say, thank you! How dare you? How dare you take the gesture from my friend, my dear friend, and just splits on its like that! She sacrificed her hard earned money to lift us up, and you just trampled it under foot This is the most hurtful thing you have done to me Nosa. You're so wrapped up in your own self-loathing, that you can't see who you are dragging down with you. Self-loathing Yes For months, all you've been doing is complaining... whining about this, that and the other! Nosa, I have tried my hardest to be patient; to be encouraging, but I find myself walking around on eggshells, when I'm with you In the last month, everything I do seems to irritate you and you seem to find Fault in everybody I am sorry! Sorry that I can't come home and fake it! I am sorry that I decided to be transparent with my wife! I am sorry that I'm doing my best to handle my responsibilities, in spite of the crappy hand that life is dealing me! You make it sound like you're the only one going through something Or that we haven't overcome challenges together At least in the past, you used to be hopeful Now it's just whining, whining, whining! Oh, I'm sorry, you call that transparency I can't believe you're heaping insults on me Because of Cynthia! Cynthia! You're so blinded, you can't even see her motive! You think she's doing this out of the goodness of her heart? She never wanted us to get married! She never wanted to see us happen! This is her opportunity to just gloat over me! You're still holding on to that? You're confusing me. Is this bitterness or pride? Or maybe it's both. Here you go, just proving me right I don't think you've ever, ever been this disrespect. No! No way! You don't get to do that! You don't get to silence me... I am not being disrespectful! It is my turn to be transparent with you. In the last month, I have found myself walking on eggshells to make sure that I'm not stressing you out to the point that I had to bottle up the fact that I almost got raped! I thought I already apologized for that! I am sorry you have to work! If I was rich like, what's his name, you will never have to work a day in your life so I am sorry, it is my fault that you almost got raped! I am traumatized But somehow it's all about you If that's not self-loathing, I don't know what is. I don't want to continue having this conversation The check was written out in my name So, if you want it that badly, let her go and write it in your name and while you're there, She can pay for your school fees and feed you too! I thought you said her surgery is almost a month from now I'm going earlier. How long after are you going to be there? I don't know. Hello, young man. Hello Sir. How are you? Good Afternoon, Sir. I'm fine, thank you Well, let me use this opportunity to let you know you're doing a fine job on this property Thank you sir. Mr. Edward, are you... Are you playing by yourself? Oh no. I found this, earlier today, in the Attic. It used to be one of my wife and I favorite game Just staring at it brings back such pleasant memories Do you play this? Um... Yeah. Sometimes with my wife Wow, that's great! Speaking of your wife, I haven't seen her in a while. Is she on vacation? Something like that... Yeah Alone? Without you? Well, I suppose she won't mind me challenging you to a game. Right now? Why not? Oh, unless you're scared Scared? What, me? Ah no, no, no, no. Mr. Edward, just wait right there.

Oh please it's nothing like that not even close. Okay? Anyways, as I was saying, before I was rudely interrupted Sorry Madam Um-hum... As I was saying... The woman had me salivating over the smell of the food It was so obvious, he had to offer me some And of course, who was I to be rude and refuse So I obliged. Lord, who sent me. Chai! That bad? What?! Let's just say, the smell was going north while the taste was going south, at full speed. I thought I was eating something different. It tasted so watered-down Oh my goodness. It was... It tasted as though someone came in and poured a gallon of water inside Wow. That bad? My sister, I kid you not. Well, with the way you're dissing the woman's food, I'm even reconsidering you trying mine. Oh no. It's too late now, I must eat that today Girl, You still haven't learnt your lesson. Oh my goodness.

Yes, please let me win for the fifth straight time Hello, Cynthia, it's Nosa. How are you? Um... I've been trying to reach Efosa and... It's going to her voicemail and it's not letting me leave a message. So, can you call me back? I want to pay her a visit or something Anyway, call me back. Please Efosa, I'm not the villain, you know. Why would you say that? Why are you ignore me? So you are ignoring me. I didn't say that! Then you're not ignoring me? I didn't say that either. It feels good to hear your voice. I mean, more so, that you're talking to me live Thank God for the privilege to, you know, travel the world, see a lot of beautiful things There are times I just want to shop and just ship it to you.. I mean, no strings attached Certain times I buy female jewelry, and... leave it in my closet Yeah Sometime, I get asked like, hey why're you doing this? I'm like, um... It keeps me in touch with my feminine side And sometimes I say, it's for the future You're not saying anything I'm listening Right. Do you want to see something? Sure Just brace yourself for this though. Cause, um... I know you're gonna be surprised when you see this Honestly and um... trust me, I still remember this like it was a few minutes ago Yeah What?!

But hey, look, he still teases me to this day Me calls me a false prophet... Yeah False prophet It's not funny! I'm sorry but that's funny No, no, no, no.

I'm... from the bottom of my... I'm so sorry Wait! What is this got to do with me? Oh... I just... I just made the biggest mistake and I am so... It was the biggest boo-boo... I swear it was a mistake Would you just tell me what it is and stop beating around the bush! Okay... Okay... Okay. So, I text you a picture earlier or I thought I text you a picture but... Anyways, I was wondering why you hadn't responded. So I went back to check my phone to see if it went through and, it did go through but I... I sent it to the wrong person. What did you send? And to whom did you send it? I... I... sent it to Nosa. What did you send to Nosa? Oh my God... Oh my God... I am so, so, so sorry It's a horrible mistake I promise. I don't... I don't even know what to say Cynthia! Mistake?! A mistake?! How could you be so careless? What kind of mistake is that? Our names are not even close! I know. It's... It's the way I saved your names How did you save? I saved him... as Efosa's M. M? Man. I sent the text to Efosa's M, instead of a Efosa. Why didn't you just save his name as Nosa? Come on, you know I know a lot of Nosas Where is my phone? I need to call... No! No! No, wait! Wait, wait. Okay? Don't be in such a rush. It's my mistake. I'll fix my mess, okay... I'll handle it! Give me my phone No! Efosa, stop being so desperate! I mean, come on, girl! Has he even called yet? What does that have to do with anything? If it were you, you would have called. Because you would have been so damn concerned. Listen, I'm trying to stay out of your private affairs. But I am so sick of seeing this man take you for granted like this. This is exactly what I'm talking about. You're an enabler. Good. You want to call him? Call him! And then you'll be back to square one Back to your old mess. So what am I supposed to do? Just sit around and wait Hell yeah! Efosa, you are the woman And a gem at that. Okay? He is the man. The man is supposed to chase you But, I bet you a man will not pursue a woman that he did not see value in And with your over-zealousness, he'll never get the chance to see how precious you are. I mean, how many times has he come by here to see you? Chai! I can't believe it! Efosa was my hero. Ah ah... Ha! She gave me hope in woman This really hurts... Ha! But why would she do something like this? Wait, what do you mean, why would she do something like this? What did she do? Wait a minute. Aren't you the one who just showed me a picture on your phone, saying, see what your Babe did? So, why are you asking me what she did? Isn't this something? It's like, you're confused and you're also trying to pass it on to me. Bro Can I hold something? Ah ah... Bros, why? Where are you going? Mr. Edwards. Good morning Nosa, have you been avoiding me? No May I come in? Yeah, come in. It's 4 a.m. 4? Boss, Couldn't this wait? What was that? Sorry. I mean, can't this wait till later? Well, for one, you have been avoiding me. But more importantly, I heard the most sound decisions are made very early in the morning between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m. It's 4:00 a.m.! Well, if we started talking now, by the time it is 5:00 a.m. You'll be ready to make a sound decision Ain't you gonna offer me a seat? Please have a seat. That's more like it. Thank you Do you want something to drink? Water, juice, coffee... Nyquil? I see you're waking up. Last time we spoke, you were thanking me for advice I didn't even know I gave You were determined to go reconcile with your wife and bring her home You even got me so excited when you shared your plan to surprise her with a visit come on... What happened between then and now? Look, I've watched you two guys live here for two years now and it's been special you have something beautiful So beautiful and special that I'm willing to put my reputation on the line coming down here so early in the morning Even though, I'm sleepwalking now and will have no recollection of this whole thing when I wake up later so what's going on? That's the man her father wanted her to marry I couldn't even meet her parents, even though were madly in love It wasn't anything personally with them, I just... I wasn't practical And where we're from, love submits to practical I couldn't provide her with the good things of life that she needed without her depending on her parents And then comes in, Prince Charming, professing his undying love for her But, she was a rebel She would not give in to all the pressure And it wasn't just coming from her family or her friends Everyone that knew her had an opinion of me But she was determined She was going to my for love and that was it But... I was poor My father was poor His father was poor And so on. I had no business falling in love with her I take it, she's from a wealthy family No. But... She comes from a very well respected and educated family I see I wanted it to work out for us so bad I prayed and prayed and God answered If I didn't believe in God before then I certainly did after So what happened? I got a visa lottery to America... The land of opportunity Suddenly everything just changed I had potential I mean, her parents still preferred her to marry that other guy. But... They knew she won't relent. So, they yielded So, where did you get the picture? Her friend... Cousin... sent it to me And you think, with all you've told me, she would just change her mind that easily? We've been married for four years. She has seen all the cards in my hand Not much of a deal. Well, love, true love, always hopes and believe for the best in spite of the circumstances Many people claim to marry for love But, it's in marriage that they find out what love truly requires of them. And frankly, That is the reason for so many broken marriages There's no love without sacrifice No selfishness in love That's more like lust And once many find out what love demands of them, they want out. One of the most attractive attributes of love is humility Many men count it as weakness, But the fact, Not a lot of us possess the strength of character it requires to bend our knee Especially, when we feel justified in our stand Hear me on this, You have something very special, very rare, very precious! Preserve it. Fight for it! Don't let pride rob you of it. I know it's easy to expect her to come running back into your arms But sometimes You have to remind her why she should come running back It's not easy. It all seems to straight and narrow at times But, it's the way Oh my goodness... Ah.. What time is it? 6:37 No, no, no... The dry cleaner closes at 7:00. I have to get that dress for tomorrow Why don't you just go and get it in the morning? The event is until the evening. They're closed on Sundays Oh! Desmond, come on in... Come on in Hi Listen, I'll be right back I have to go to the dry cleaners, okay... I'll see you in a second How are you doing Efosa? I'm okay. Ummm... I got you a little something What is it? Well, there's only one way to find out It's beautiful. Why don't you try it on? Desmond, you know I can't do that. What's wrong is he broken? Desmond I'm being serious! Why? Why do you want to complicate things? I mean, there're no strings attached. I mean, I specifically made sure the... The price tag was taken off. It's... It's nothing... It's just a gift. Where do you see this going? Wherever love leads, Efosa Look I've never gotten over you. I... I don't, I don't think I can My love for you will never die Maybe it's... Maybe it's just a crush No! It's more than that. This is true love Look, I've been blessed with a lot Whatever money can buy, I can afford it But, all of these things don't matter If they're not shared with that special someone Efosa, no woman, none has been... None has been able to come close to taking your place in my heart I love you. Efosa, is everything okay?

What? How much is Desmond paying you? What are you talking... Paying me for what? To wreck my home First of all, I have no idea what you're talking about. Secondly, I think you need to calm down before you say something that you're gonna regret You're going a little too far Oh really? Yes! That is what you make out of this? It's rather obvious! Oh please Efosa, don't be ridiculous Oh am I? Yes! Very much! I... I can't believe that that would even cross your mind... Obviously, You don't know me as well as you think you do and certainly don't know Desmond at all. Let me tell you something about Desmond that you... Either don't know or refuse to understand. Desmond is a great guy! A great guy! The most generous person I know, and that's an understatement. You stumbling over this? Please! That's just chicken change for people like Desmond At least, he chooses to help people Forgive me for my naivete But $8,000 seems a lot more like a paycheck, than charity! That is because your husband is poor! It probably takes him two months of hard work, plus overtime, just to see something like this. But... This... This is a dinner dress. A birthday gift. A wristwatch... to people like Desmond! And he chooses to help people I didn't know you were in need of charity Of course... and you will never know because even if I needed money I would never come running to you. So that's what you think of me? Every time I have confided in you with my financial struggles, you think I'm asking you for money?! Nosa was right about you. Thank God we didn't take your money! Well, that still doesn't change the fact that he is still broke, and still putting you through suffer-head in America By the way, where did you think that $5,000 came from? Cynthia, not everything in life is about money There are more important things. Things like love Like your character Like your soul. Something you've clearly sold to become a homewrecker in exchange for his generosity Wow... That was low, Efosa. That hurt. The truth hurts That's a nice one. One more... Change position... More, more. Move in closer... That's it! Yes! Yes! That is good! That is good! Ah, that's nice. That is so nice. Wow... Wow... Ah, more, more, more, wait. One more, one more, one more!
