Five years after Lynx Win at the Peewee Tournament Moscow, Russia Junior Hockey World Championship (Russian): Polunin loses the puck, Trudel intercepts it... He runs with it... and he scores! What a magnificent goal by Janeau Trudel! Here in Moscow, the crowd isn't even trying to hide its annoyance. The score is now 1-1. Karpov passes to Fazleev... Fazleev shoots it back to him and... A superb goal by Karpov! Karpov dominated this championship. In my opinion, he's not only the best hockey player in Russia, he's also the most promising new player in Europe. Russia is now leading 2-1. Trudel shoots into the Russian zone, he recovers the puck and skates behind the Russian goal. He pauses, passes to his right, the puck comes right back... and he scores! Overall, the Canadian Team had an excellent championship, but it's been a rollercoaster ride for Janeau Trudel. No one will forget his penalty for slashing during the third period, in the quarter finals against Finland. - Yes. It could have spelled disaster for the Canadian Team. The score remains 2-2, and we're now in overtime. Trudel recovers the puck and leaves his territory. He's now in the Russian zone, trying to pass to a teammate. Karpov intercepts the puck for the Russian Team. He skates into the opposing zone, ends up in front of the goalie, shoots in reverse... It's a magnificent win for Russia! MAJOR JUNIOR The Russians were pretty good. Are you nuts? They're just a bunch of primates on a vodka drip! Welcome back, man! What's wrong with you? You guys have a reason to celebrate? You've been gone for three weeks. That's reason enough to party! If it wasn't for Karpov-- Forget about Karpov already! OK? - All right. Glad you're back, man. We're gonna turn it around, guys. Because we are... we are? We're champions! The best in the country, the champions! The best hockey team in Chicoutimi, the champions! Tonight, Chicoutimi is happy to propose a toast to its Junior Hockey World Championship medalist... Janeau Trudel! Hey, congratulations! - Hi, Julie. What are you doing here? - Celebrating with you! How did you find us? - Facebook, you twit! Oh yeah, that's right. Since you're out for once, let's party. - Yes! Don't you have homework? - Already done. You study too hard, Julie. - What? Hi, Julie. Hi! Guys, this is Mario. He works at the CEGEP. Hi. - Hi, Mario! Sorry, could you sign my Jersey? I'm a big, big fan. No problem. Thanks, man. You're okay. See you. Hey, guys... Shooters! Man, she's so hot! Her mother goes out with my dad. So what? It's not like she's your sister or anything. You don't think she's different now? I've known her all my life. So you wouldn't go out with her? Way too complicated, man! Cloé St-Jacques. Now that's simple. Cute! Hey, Magic! How you doing? Fighting fit! You're not wasting any time tonight. Let's dance. All right, come on. - OK. Bye, guys! - Bye. Thanks again! Boy, you're really wasted! Careful, a car's coming up... Hey, Janeau! Good job! Can you drive? - Yeah. You sure? I'm not so sure... Shit, man! Holy sh... Come on, get up. Get up! No... - Get up! I'm okay. - Yeah, yeah, you're okay. Change sides. Julie: Cool seeing you again. Xoxo Fuck! Joe, Joe... Joe... Joe! You'll learn that driving under the influence is a lot more serious than a 10-minute penalty for misconduct. We have zero tolerance. Next time... Get it? Thanks! Man, we're really blessed. We're blessed by the gods! Do you realize that? Yeah. - Come on. Janeau! Janeau! - Uh? Your agent keeps calling. - Uh? Get up! Oh, shit! Joe! Joe, wake up! I don't remember much about last night. That was a close one! You're lucky the cops were fans. Too right! We keep it to ourselves, ok? For sure. You can trust me. There he is... Janeau! Janeau! Hi. I'm Friendly Remy. - Hi. Hey, I'm glad. I'm really, really glad. Do you mind if we take a quick photo? Why don't we-- - Just a quick photo. It won't take a minute. It's more fun with girls, but it pays more with me. Ok, let's go. Let's go. - Thanks. Look at that! It's really good. My son's gonna freak out. Okay, in 3... 2... 1... and... Action-Emotion! When you're the best, you do business with the best. Friendly Remy drafted Janeau Trudel to slash its prices! Yes, Friendly Remy. I'm here to slash your prices. Come on! Cut! What's... Maybe you could go sleep elsewhere or whatever. OK! Let's roll! Go ahead, my Janeau! Slash our prices! Slash his prices, not his windows! At Friendly Remy's in Chicoutimi, we're real champs! - We're real champs! Take good care of it. "MAGIC'S BACK" Magic's back! Mr. Séguin. He's not up to the job. Relax! We're losing, but let's give him time-- He lost control of the locker room. If we don't win tonight, he's out. Your father wouldn't do that. - You're right. I'm too tolerant. He'd have done it a long time ago. From the Canadian Junior Hockey League... You'll find the names and numbers of all the players here. So, if you're looking for-- - Never mind. Number 18: Jerome Chabot, 16, drafted in the second round, spent his Midget AAA years with the Gouverneurs de Ste-Foy. Number 51: Nicolas Blouin, 18, played with the Cantonniers de Magog. Number 56 is the captain-- - Fine, fine. You're a real hotshot. The Sags' goal was scored by Number 9, Janeau Trudel! Stay neutral, Julie. Here, you're a reporter first. Did you see that? Janeau! "PROUD TO BE SAGS!" The Sags' goal was scored by Number 10, Joey Boulet! That's a good start! SECOND PERIOD - LOCALS: 2 - VISITORS: 1 Did they close down the bars again? - That was a rotten change. You should've backed him. - I'm holding back till the 3rd period. This goal was scored by Number 18, Jerome Chabot, with an assist from Number 51, Nicolas Blouin. VISITORS: 2 THIRD PERIOD Blue, Number 9: two minutes for slashing! Come on, Ref, you didn't see him slash? It's a great game, too bad you're missing it! He's doing his star turn. Two-minute penalty for slashing! And two more minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct! Come on! Are you happy, Ref? 3-2! You love that, right? The goal was scored by Number 51, Nicolas Blouin, with an assist from Number 20, Cedric Lemay, 5 minutes and 14 seconds into the third period! He's never coached Juniors! He won't do better than Séguin. But he knows Trudel. Good job, Blou! - Thanks. P.O.! P.O.! Shit! The Huskies' goal was scored without an assist by Number 56, Peter Kolakova, 19 minutes and 54 seconds into the third period. Their spaghetti's really good. I don't suppose my agent drove up to Chicoutimi to eat spaghetti. Uh, no, no. My news aren't so good. The Draft Prospect Rankings are out. You're no longer on top. Karpov is. Are you kidding me? - No. You're number 2 now. Come on, I'm way better than him! - Calm down, Janeau. It's just a number on a list. Being good enough to come first then throwing it all away, well, that's kind of dumb. So, you were partying again last night? So what? Do you want to be first pick or not? Of course. Then stop whooping it up and practice. I've never missed practice! - Janeau, I don't care! Things need to change. Is that clear? Yes. Miss! Give me the bill, please. Excuse me. You should come to supper, it's been awhile. I'll check my schedule. - All right. Four against four. He shoots but misses the goal. Hi, Dad. - Wait a sec. Another big game tonight, uh? Yeah. The list's pretty long, so let's start right away. I didn't eat my supper. You can eat later. I have to work tomorrow. All right, shoot. Let's start with your shots on goal. Joe, you have to shoot more. Two shots, that's not enough! Yeah, but that wasn't-- - That won't get you anywhere! You have a good game when you shoot 6 or 7 times. Last year, in all your 2-point plus games, you shot 5 times or more. So stop faffing around with Trudel and shoot more often. OK. You're not taking this seriously. - No, no. That's not it. This is the chance of a lifetime! How many kids would do anything to play in the major leagues? I know, Dad. You know. Right. Good evening, Mr. Boulet! - Hi, Janeau. How are you? Good weather in St-Hilaire? Yeah, yeah, it's nice. Look, I'm not through with Joey. Hey, Dad! I can't see you. Can you hear me? Shitty camera... Can you hear me? Piece of junk! Finally! I don't know how you stand it. He's worse since he split from my mom. And he's your agent too! No thanks. I'm good. Let's talk about the bomb that rocked Chicoutimi's hockey community. Gilbert Séguin, who's been coaching the Saguenéens for six years and who led the team to the Memorial Cup last year, has been fired! "Here's the door. Get out!" It happened right after last night's bitter defeat and Janeau Trudel's return. Today's question for our hotline is: "Following the Sags' disastrous early season..." Hurry up, Joe! We're late! - Yeah. "...did management panic or make a necessary change? You're listening to Class Radio, 103,5 FM with Julie Morneau." Good! Our superstars are here. We can finally begin. I want you all to understand that the situation is unacceptable. I don't fire coaches to please you or make excuses for you, but because we have to make the playoffs. Once we're in the playoffs... anything's possible. Right, guys? Yeah. - Yeah. Thanks, Claude. You can bring him in. Let me introduce your new coach, Stéphane Côté. Hi, guys! I already know some of you, and I'll get to know the others. One thing's for sure... The good life is over. I came here to win and we're going to win! Moving up in the rankings and making the playoffs, that's our goal from now on. We're going to win as a team, in playing formations where each player has a specific role. Understood? - Yes. Yes. Hey, that's crazy! Your old Peewee coach... Assistant Coach. And he's way too stiff for me now. "I came here to win!" Want a common goal, girls? Hey, guys! I tripped on the blue line! Come here. Why? Come here. You've been drinking? No. Don't bullshit me. One beer over lunch. Strip down. Whoa, whoa! I'm not a stripper! I'm not kidding. You're not playing tonight. You're serious? For one lousy beer? If you're not out in 5 minutes, Boulet, it's a two-game suspension. If you think pissing off your best players will help you win, you're crazy! Mind your own business. Pass! Janeau! Hey! Trudel! Where's your speed when it's time to back someone? Go back and stop trying to win the game on your own! Move it! Shit! He sent him back. - Why did he do that? He's trying to fire up Trudel. - It won't work. Well, he's doing something! Julie, let's have a beer sometime. Say when. Never! Come on! No girl in town would refuse. Meet the first one. Go back to your seat, Meatball! Luke: Are you hurt? Referee! That's not one for the books. Seems like the coach isn't the problem after all. Hello? Sorry, wrong number. Don't hang up, Julie! It's Joey. Janeau went running without his cell. Hey, man! Heard the news? No. I have a date with Julie! I swear, man! Bang on target! How did you swing that? - Oh well... Just another victim of the famous Joey Boulet charm. Hi. Hey, Julie! I'm happy to see you. Me too. Let me help you. Thanks. There. Sit down. - Thanks. Are you good to go? You mean right now? Why not? That's why we're here. I thought the interview was just cover-up for a date. You know? - No. You don't have to, I can leave. I'm kidding! Happy to oblige. Looking forward to it. There you go. It's my treat! And a glass of water, please. Thanks. Julie, I'm sure you'll make a terrific reporter. You've always been sneaky. Thank you. I suppose that's good. All right, first question. How does it feel to be a player in Quebec's Major Junior League? Well... of course it's a mega trip. Everybody's tripping over us. Everywhere we go, we're tripping, everyone's tripping, so... So it's a mega trip. Yeah. HOMEWORK HELP Thank you. - You're welcome. Doesn't that give you the feeling that you're invincible sometimes? Why don't we go somewhere else? Like your place? Make an effort, it's nearly over. First, I have to unfurl my hose in the washroom. I could tell you a real good story but you have to swear you won't repeat it. Don't worry, I never betray my sources. OK. Remember that party a while ago? Yes. - Well, I don't remember much. I was in pretty bad shape, so there's a few blank spots... Whoa! That's some story. - Yeah. You must've been pissing drunk to forget you'd gone off-road! And you were driving? Yeah, that was kind of dumb. You were lucky. Hey! You won't tell anyone, right? Of course not. No. All right. "I always wanted to tell you, but I didn't know how. You have to know that I lov--" Go ahead, skate! Come on! It's not over, I didn't whistle! Keep skating! Skate, skate! Come on, skate! So? It's bad. My Midget AAA kids were in better condition. If they don't shape up fast, I'm rebuilding the team. Stand up, it's not over! Joey? Hi! I'm Nathalie Leblanc, director of Player Services for the League. Hi. What's the matter? We have programs that could help you, you know. What are you talking about? Do you think a problem like yours stays under the radar? HOW TO REDUCE YOUR ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION What's that got to do with me? The first step is to admit it. I don't have a problem, ma'am. Bye! When you're ready, call me! We work with therapists and organizations. We have tons of tools to help you! Sure! Welcome the Saguenéens! Is that your term paper? Yes. Can I get a look? Sure! "IDOLIZING OUR JUNIOR PLAYERS: GOOD OR BAD?" CKOR 91,6. The radio plugged into the heart of the Saguenay. Sportscast with Louis Drouin, sponsored by Friendly Remy from Chicoutimi, where they slash prices! Wow! You have big news for us this morning, Louis. Yes, sir! That's what we call a scoop. About certain Saguenéens who received special treatment, rumor has it? Exactly! It just happened and it'll shake the foundations of the Georges-Vézina Centre. According to my sources, two Sags players were taken home by the police after being arrested in a state of intoxication. Oh, shit... Do you know who was involved? My sources tell me that Janeau Trudel was driving. What? Janeau... Janeau "Magic" Trudel? - Yes, sir! Janeau "Magic" Trudel in person. Flashback to the 1970's! Who did you tell? - That's appalling really... Nobody, man! How are our young players supposed to learn responsibility when even the cops give them special treatment? It's not true... No! - Listen, Mr. Policeman. Being a cop is more than handing out traffic tickets. Joey! Wait! What's the matter? I don't know, man. I don't understand... Wait! You opened your big mouth, right? - Wait! Joey, I'm freaking out! He stole my paper! What? Drouin stole my paper! It's Julie? - How come? You promised to keep quiet! I didn't say anything! It's not my fault. What happened? You told her? He wanted to see my paper. I didn't think-- I'm his trainee, Joey! I trusted him! Christ! What did you do? Buddy, I... - Joe! Janeau's with you? She just asked me a few questions for her term paper... We swore we wouldn't tell! Joey, tell him I'm sorry! It wasn't my fault! What were you thinking, Morneau? - It's not her fault! Janeau, it's Drouin's fault! He's nuts, he stole my paper! You didn't have to use my name! I didn't use any names! So why did mine come out? - She promised not to say anything! Why did you say I was driving? - I never said that! Janeau, it's Drouin's fault! She can't despise you because you're dying to screw her! You're nuts! You dropped me in deep shit! Hey! It's not my fault! Get it? Janeau! Joey never said you were driving! Drouin invented the rest because I didn't write your names! Drouin's a dick and I'm in deep shit! Here, you can have her. - Janeau! Go to hell! Shit! Julie? No, no! Minus 4 degrees outside, minus 21 with the windchill factor, so cover up, my friends! We're expecting another cold day tomorrow, less windy, with snow flurries on the horizon. Drouin, you stole my paper! Whoa, whoa, calm down! Come on! You know scoops are fair game. That's ridiculous! No one was named in my paper! My buddy tows cars for the police. He couldn't tell you who was driving! It wasn't Trudel? You'll regret your lies, you pig. Nobody cares about the real driver! Trudel makes better copy. Steve, it's Drouin's style! You have to do something! Calm down. There was no arrest and there's no proof either. Once people cool down, everything will be fine. You didn't hear all the crap they said about me on the air! We'll send Drouin a cease and desist. It'll shut him up. Meanwhile, don't say another word. Shit, it's Roberge. - What the hell was that? Drouin again. I hope no one's buying it. Is it true or not? - You're kidding, right? Answer me! I won't justify myself to that clown. Call my agent. Hey, I'm not finished! - Sorry, got an exam. That little shit... Here's the question of the hour: in your opinion, is it the end of the love story between Janeau Trudel and Chicoutimi? Next call! He's gonna have to pay for his mistakes, that's for sure. A big head like his can't be too popular in the locker room, no, Sir! They'll never make the playoffs now. You're right, it's disappointing. The kid's talented, but he has no judgment. They'll get rid of him for sure. What were you thinking? There's plenty of cabs around! I know. - His entire life's ruined. Come on, there's no proof. - Appearances are all that matter now. Management has to protect the Sags' image. They'll exchange him and you'll lose your centerman. They can't do that, Dad! - Wanna bet? You're both in deep shit! Don't you get it? Thanks, Yvan. Let's take another call. Louis, with a criminal record, he'll never play in the States. I can't say you're wrong, Sir. I can't say that. It could end his career, that's for sure. Ah, shit! What did you do? The Janeau Trudel affair is getting serious. We just learned that two Chicoutimi policemen have been suspended indefinitely in relation to this case. The Chief of Police refuses to confirm that the two incidents are linked. It's his own fault. That's nonsense. No, he fucked up big time. He wasn't driving. Sure he was. Whatever. Hi, Janeau. It's your father. Listen, Douville called me. He says it's going to be fine and we shouldn't worry. Keep playing and call me if you need anything, all right? We're on your side, son. Once again, a popular hero fell off his pedestal in a world ruled by marketing and bullshit! I'm standing in front of Janeau Trudel's home away from home. Earlier today, we tried to get a few comments. I'm going up the steps. Hi! Mylène Tremblay, reporter. Do you have any comments? No comment. - Is Mr. Trudel at home? Can we come in? - This is our home, go away! Just a second! Obviously, Janeau Trudel's lodger... What do you want? - Joey... It's crazy to make Janeau pay for your mistakes. It's all over the news! - Don't you think I know that? You're responsible for this mess! - If you're really his friend, you'll tell the truth. Oh! That's Mr. Trudel's vehicle. He's driving. Janeau, care to comment? Mr. Trudel! Tell us what happened. - Just two minutes! Mr. Trudel! Mr. Trudel, just a few questions! - Mr. Trudel, over here! Mr. Trudel, one comment please. It'll take two seconds. Crap... We'll try to get more information from the Sags' Headquarters tomorrow. Mr. Boulet! Mr. Boulet, care to comment? Uh... - What are you doing, Joe? I want to make a statement. - We're listening. It won't take long. Janeau Trudel wasn't driving that night. I was. It was my truck and I was driving. Were you intoxicated? Is it true that the cops took you home? - Fucking moron... I have nothing to add. Thank you. Can you tell us the names of the policemen who took you home? You just heard from Joey Boulet. What? Why did you do it? I had no choice. You're my best pal. I'm sorry. That's it. The Huskies... That was fast. It's best for the team. You can't do that to me. The Sags are my family! I can do whatever I want, Joey. It's my team. So, the first time I mess up, it's "Bye-bye, Boulet!" That's it? Calm down-- - Fuck you! Hey! Try to think long term. It's just business. Joey! A word of advice. If you ever want to sign a pro contract, get rid of "Agent Daddy". Yeah, you think you're so smart! You hung up on me, but this time, you're gonna listen. No way am I gonna let you ruin my son's life, you crazy bitch! All right? I'm gonna... Text me when you get there. Thanks. Without you, I'd never have gotten this far. That's nonsense. - It's true. Joe, I have to tell you... Joey! I just heard the news. I'm sorry, guys. I know I messed up but I didn't want that. Yeah, so you said. You were really brave. You took responsibility... and I admire you for that, Joe. Thanks. I hope everything goes well in Rouyn. You can call me anytime, OK? Cool. So... Time to go. Do you want to grab a bite? I have homework. You can bet the teams won't be as welcoming to young players who have problems off the ice. - Next call. Boulet isn't up to league standards. If he's unreliable too, he'll end up hauling garbage for sure! Hi, Joey. It's Nathalie Leblanc, the director of Player Services. Remember me? You must be feeling pretty raw right now. If you want to talk, I'm right here. Don't hesitate to call. Thank you. Bye. Hang in there, man. Hey, Joe! Shit... Hey! What are you doing here? You okay? - Yeah. The league lady called me. Hockey and booze don't mix well. Don't freak out. I don't drink that much. Sure. Come on. You need help, so I'm here for you. The Huskies' management is behind me 100 %. An alcoholic helping another alkie. Isn't that wonderful! I'm in control, Joe. You're not. Oh, really? When you bawled out the Sags' owner, you thought you were in control? I'm just trying to do my job as your agent, okay? My drunken agent. All right, fine. We'll do it together. Sure! - I'm serious. If you stop, I'll stop. Not another drop? Not a drop. But you can't drink either. Listen, I'll be blunt. Unless we score a lot of wins, you're next on the list. I don't have a choice. Soon, it'll be too late to exchange players. Either we win or we rebuild. Hey! Our playing system is pretty tight. Each player has his seat. - Hi, Blou! Hi, Coach. With us, you'll have a chance to prove you don't need Trudel. Guys, let's be honest. Everyone is saying that we don't have a shot. Even management has lost hope. They exchanged Boulet for a dozen hockey sticks. It's a fresh start for us. You're the new captain. From now on... Janeau is our leader. Blou! Blou! Blou! Over here! We want to finish strong, sure, but we want to shine in the playoffs. So I want you to spend all your free time right here. Come on, Blou! Do what you have to do to get back in shape. I'm not interested in what you did in Chicoutimi. I worked hard to get you, Boulet, so don't crap out on me. Come on, man. Hey! Be a man, Joe! Be a man... Hey! Forget your father, focus on the game. That's easy to say. Our goal is the same: make the playoffs! We need 5 more points. Let's play one game at a time. You went crying to the coach, Trudel? I didn't ask for anything... and I don't deserve to be captain. I made some mistakes and I wasn't always on point. You can't avoid all the bad stuff. Afterwards, you have to step up and try even harder! I just want to win... and I'll prove it on the ice. Sags! - Go, go, go! Joey: Are you dead? Text me back. Janeau! Pass! Good job, guys! THE SAGS HAVE A SHOT AT THE PLAYOFFS! Hey, Boulet! Next game, you'll play center on the third line. I'm sorry. Bravo, my boy! Great, Boulet! That's exactly what we want from you. A goal by Number 10, Joey Boulet... - That's my boy! with an assist from Number 51, Nicolas Blouin... Hey, Morneau! I'm glad you're back. That was a big win tonight! My final trainee report. Ah! That's good. And I want to thank you. No need. I do the best job I can, that's all. Thanks to you, I know I'll never do trash radio. We have to keep everyone happy, you know. When I started here, I was sweeping the floors. You can do whatever you want. And I bet you'll make a great reporter. I know. I don't need you to tell me. Janeau! So? - I want to say that... I get that you're angry with me because of Joe, but-- Forget it. I shouldn't have been mean to you. I know it wasn't your fault. I'm sorry. Okay. Did you hear from Joey? Not in a while, no. You? No. Aren't you worried? Maybe you should call him. I'd rather not. He sounded pretty depressed the last time he texted me. If only I'd been brave enough... Stop it! It's not your fault. He's the one who messed up! I can't stand it! When I think about it... I feel like I'm suffocating. Janeau... What's the matter? Do you regret it? I love you, Julie. Hi! You're a Huskie, right? Yes, my man! Joey Boulet? - Yeah, that's right! Did you see the game? I scored the winning goal. Oh yeah? - Yes, yes. That's cool. Real cool. - Yeah. That's worth a little reward, right? Yeah, but... I can't sell you beer. Excuse me? What's that? JOEY BOULET: "NO BEER" Fucking Luke... Dad, we're young, we're having fun like everyone else. Sure. All right! So... So we have an announcement. You know that we've been together for three years-- We're getting married. Sorry, honey. - What? Mom! No kidding! When? Next summer! In church, with the white gown and the whole shebang! That's crazy! Congratulations, Mom. Look! Congratulations. But I'm not finished. Our family's getting bigger. You're pregnant? That's so amazing! - Isn't it exciting? How long has it been? - Three months. Aren't you both a bit too old? Janeau! I mean... Congratulations! We're going to be one big happy family. You can come see us with your children. Sure, I guess we'd make beautiful kids, Julie and me. No, I didn't mean that. Why not? Come on, Janeau, Julie's practically your sister. She isn't my sister at all. Show a little respect. You're so out of it, Dad! Why did you say that? Janeau! So you bought milk at the convenience store? What about you? Are you holding on? What? Never mind. Have a good day! See you later. - Bye. Hey, Julie! Hi, Mario. - J... Julie! Are you dating Trudel? I'm not prying, I just... I saw you kissing. Well, yes. It's kind of crazy... I think I'm in love. Ah. That's great. What's the matter? Huh... It's just... What? You know I'm fond of you, Julie. And we always want the best for our friends. But sometimes, people aren't who we think they are. What do you mean? Hi, Julie! What's the matter? You're a liar, Janeau Trudel. How come? Stop pretending! What are you talking about? Stop your bullshit, Janeau! That's enough! You're talking to me! - Calm down. What's the matter? You didn't just lie to me, you lied to everyone! I know you were driving. Who told you that? There's a witness! The school janitor, Mario, saw you leave! Fat Mario? That guy will say anything! Sure, like Drouin, uh? Stop lying to my face! I trusted you. All right, I lied. I was going to confess, Julie, but then Joey told the reporters. And you let him take the blame without saying a word? Congratulations! You're a good friend. I know it's wrong. I don't know what came over me... I can't believe it. I'm sorry, Julie. Go away. Give me a chance. Get out! Julie... Get out! THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THE TRUDEL STORY Julie: Do you want me to send it to a reporter? THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THE TRUDEL STORY Hi, Julie. It's me. I just got your message. Don't do that, okay? Let me deal with it. I just need some time. I'll find a way, I promise you! I'm sorry for the whole mess, but... trust me, please! "Trust me!" Take that! Dude, dude! You sent him flying! Too bad he didn't stay pinned to the boards! Keep going, Joe. Sorry to ambush you like this, but I had no choice. No... He betrayed me, and you too. Now I don't know what to do. Call me back when you can. Fuck! No! You're my pal! You're my pal! Joey, whoa! Hey! Hey! No! No! - Calm down. Calm down and tell me what happened. He was my pal. He was my pal... I'd never do it to him. - Joey, calm down. My pal... - Tell me what happened. Joey! Guys, get on the bus. Move! I need to talk to Joey. - You don't belong here. I came straight from Chicoutimi, Mr. Lapointe. I need to talk to him. Trudel! I'm gonna kick your ass! Calm down, Joe. - Let me go! Calm down... - Let go! Joey, I just wanted to tell you-- - I know! Julie told me. Fucking hypocrite! Joe, come with me. Joe... Hey! - You were my pal, man! That's enough. - My pal! Joe, come on! Get on the bus. He won't talk to you. Get lost or I'm calling the cops. Come on! Get on the bus. Let's go, guys! You stink! Sylvie told me. About Julie? About Julie... and about Joey. Yeah, everything. She anticipated me again. Why did you do it, Janeau? What came over you? Did you really think you could betray your best friend without any repercussions? Where's your conscience? Where's your moral sense? Where's your heart? I don't know. On top of that, you drove under the influence of alcohol! It's a crime! You could have killed-- - I wasn't drunk. You weren't drunk? I stopped drinking a couple of hours before we left. Wait... Wait, I don't understand. If you weren't drunk, why did you let the cops believe Joey was driving? We were stuck in a snow bank, the cops were coming and I panicked. I was afraid to lose it all. All right. So for you, that justified betraying your best friend? Do you realize the fall-out? You were afraid to lose it all? Your plan didn't work out too well. And Joey... Do you realize what you did to him? Did you even apologize? I tried, but... he won't talk to me. Neither will Julie. Julie is an honest girl. You knew she'd never condone it! You fucked up big time, son! You hurt people and you can't erase that! Christ Almighty! It's no use feeling sorry for yourself. What's done is done and you'll have to live with it. From now on... you make the decisions. You make the choices. But most of all... you accept responsibility. Make the first move, my boy. Call the shots for once. Get your coat, we're leaving. Your coach told me everything. This isn't over, believe me. I'll call Drouin and-- - You won't do anything. It's too late. We have no proof and no one will believe me. It's done. You're going to let it go? You're taking the fall for him. You're drunk-- No! Listen! It's my business, my life, all right? I don't want to hear about it again, least of all on the radio! Come on. - Hey, let go! Listen, I know it's a hard pill to swallow, but that's no reason to start drinking again. We had a deal. Yeah. It takes two sides to make a deal. Right? What about the bottle of booze I found in the kitchen? Joey, I had it when I got here. I didn't touch it, I swear. More bullshit! That bottle was almost empty! And you took it with you for three measly sips? So you did drink it. Yes! I never stopped. Just another liar. Joe, I'm sorry, but I made that deal for you. You had to stop. And it worked, you stopped. So what's your plan? I don't know what to do. I've reached my limit. Joey, you have to stop drinking if you want to give yourself a chance. Good day to you all. I'm sending you this video because I want to set the record straight. I showed a lack of respect to the entire Saguenéens team and its management. I didn't deserve the trust they put in me. I lied and at the end of the day, I did myself a disservice. I realize that I disappointed my fans, the reporters, the people close to me, my family, my teammates, my friends... even the most important person in my life. I sincerely apologize to you all. Enclosed, you'll find a brilliant paper written by Julie Morneau, a reporter of immense talent. Her article discloses all the details of my story. From now on, I'll make sure people talk about me for the right reasons. Thank you. One point from the playoffs and with a single match left to play, it's now or never for the Sags! Will Magic Trudel save the day? Will he earn people's forgiveness after his staggering revelations? You're a liar, Trudel! The Sags' goal - and his third one tonight - was scored without an assist by Number 9, Janeau "Magic" Trudel! We made the playoffs, guys! "Trudel leads the Sags to the playoffs!" Everybody's been waiting for tonight's playoffs between the Chicoutimi Saguenéens and Rouyn-Noranda's Huskies! Alain, the Sags are driven by their star player Janeau Trudel, who accumulated 39 points over the last 12 games! He's a great hockey player. And with the controversy surrounding Janeau Trudel and Joey Boulet, we can all expect an epic duel. Hi. - Hi. So you came. Are you nervous? A little. Did you talk to Joey since... No. I just came to wish you luck. It's all right. Sit down. Everything's fine. Just fine. Okay, okay. Guys, tonight I want you to keep up the pressure, all right? We'll play our formations for the full 60 minutes of play time and we'll come away with the win. Is that clear? Yes! - Great! I want complete body checks from each one of you. When an opposing player gets the puck, make sure it hurts. Keep it simple. If it doesn't work, dump-and-chase and forecheck. Is that clear? - Yes! Perfect! Boulet, get on Trudel's ass. No one knows him like you do. Thanks, coach. Guys, we'll have to fight for every inch of ice to get the win. After every tussle against the boards, I want to see a Red & Black with the puck! Guys, let's play a great match! - Yes! Listen up, guys! I know the Sags like the back of my hand! Without Trudel, they're nothing! All right? Go Huskies!! Go Huskies! - Let's get them! Hey! Make him lose focus, do whatever you want, but it can't show on your score sheet. This is your chance to shine. Go on. Sags! - Go, go, go! Let's go, boys! Let's welcome the Huskies! How are you? Fine. I'm sorry, Joe. - Did you like screwing your sister? Weak knees, uh? You're gonna sweat bullets, man! I never wanted that trade! - Best thing ever for me! On your knees again? - What's next? You're gonna hack off my ankle? That's enough... Enough! The train rolled over you, Trudel? That's how you want it, Boulet? You wanna fight? Oh-ho! Come on! How about dropping your gloves, uh? Come on, man, come on! Come on, come on! Take Trudel away! You scared, Boulet? What a moron! Go, go. - What's the matter? Hey, no fair! Why don't you bench them both? He should be out too! Penalty for the Sags! Number 9, Janeau Trudel, gets two minutes for misconduct! Attaboy! Good job, Boulet. It's too easy. Come on, guys! Power play! He could've kicked his ass, but a 2-minute penalty is better. Well done, Joe! He wanted to fight him? - Looks like it. But he never fights! PLAYER 9: PENALTY - 0:30 Go team! Go, go, go! The Huskies' first goal was scored by Number 10, Joey Boulet... HUSKIES: 1 SAGUENÉENS: 0 ...assisted by Number 51, Nicolas Blouin, 18 minutes and 18 seconds into the first period. Janeau, calm down! Don't play his game, all right? Calm down. I don't know what's up with Joey, but he's not the same player. He's always on Janeau's tail. - He's doing his job. Stéphane, you have to do something about Boulet. I'll try, but without the last line change, it's tricky. You're not that good, eh? - Don't force me to make you look bad. Pass! Hold on to your stick! - Shut up and play, all right? Come on, guys! Get ready to back Janeau. Come on, Boulet! We have a shot, come on! Hurry up! Fred! Come here! All right, go! Go back, Boulet! Lemay, on the bench! Come on, he took a dive! - No, he didn't. Sure he did! - Go on. Come on, Ref! Open your eyes, it was a dive! So long, loser! 10 Black: penalty for hooking! Should I score you from 1 to 10? Penalty for the Huskies' Number 10, Joey Boulet: two minutes for hooking! The Sags' goal was scored by Number 9, Janeau Trudel, with assists from Number 18, Jerome Chabot, and Number 63, Loic Faucher! HUSKIES: 1 SAGUENÉENS: 1 Stay focused! Stay focused, boys! What did I say, Boulet? - He dove! Hey! No excuses, is that clear? Next time, skate faster instead of hooking him! Fred, come here! Get ready! Hurry up! Hey! Hey! Hey! His second goal! Wow! Why don't you send my boy back on the ice? You're missing a good game! SECOND PERIOD - SAGUENÉENS: 2 Wake up, guys! The game's already begun! I've had enough! You keep giving up the blue line! Stop moving back! Get rid of him before I lose it! What's the matter? You're not feeling it? In second period, you looked like a bunch of wimps. You'd better wake up! We're lucky it's just 2 to 1! In third period, I don't want to see Trudel swanning into our zone like a ballerina, all right? Boulet, if you can't do the job, I'll find someone who can. We're not playing ringette, you're allowed to touch your pal. He's not my pal. In third period, I want you to be aggressive, always intense on the ice! Let's win that third period and let's win the game! Come on! What's the score again, Boulet? Kill him!! Speed! Speed! Janeau's line! Hey, traitor! Better than a drunk! It's not over, Trudel! HUSKIES: 1 SAGUENÉENS: 2 What's wrong? Is it your knee? We're going to turn you slowly. Slowly, slowly... It's official: Chicoutimi Saguenéens star forward Janeau Trudel will miss the end of the Quebec Major Junior League playoffs. He probably won't be able to skate for the rest of the season. Rumor says that his entire career could be in jeopardy. We're still waiting for the League to decide whether or not Joey Boulet will be sanctioned. Boulet, my office. Coach? How many games? Hey, Joe! What are you doing? Relax! I've been suspended for the whole playoffs. That's no surprise. Did you hear? Trudel won't play either. So? Well... You really think that makes me happy? Not even a little bit? Hey, my season is over! My season! Relax, it's not the end of the world. At least you paid him back! What? You did the right thing! You did the right thing. You're a moron. Hey! He got what he deserved and you know it. What are you doing? I'm getting the hell out. - To go where? None of your business. You think you can leave just like that? I put up with you for years. Now I'm done. I sacrificed everything for you and now I'm the asshole. Right? Right? Hey! - Hey! Stop! Let go! You're nothing but a drunk! Joey! Get out of my way. If you go, there's no coming back. Fuck off. Three months later Look, Gaston, Trudel is bound to be first pick! He's been injured, Gilbert. You have to factor that in. Guys-- He didn't even need surgery! I can't believe-- Gilbert, let him speak. - Chantale, guys, if I'm Buffalo and I have first pick, I'm going with Karpov. Not you too! What's wrong with you guys? You're killing me! Trudel's as good as he was last year. Talent doesn't fade away! - Gilbert, you made your point, but it's time to join Alain Crête in Vancouver, a few minutes before the draft starts. Alain, some Quebeckers are going to experience strong emotions today. Yes, Chantale. Obviously, Janeau Trudel can still stir up passions in the studio. For my part, Chantale, I'm more interested in finding out if his attacker Joey Boulet will get picked, and if his actions will have a long-term impact on his future. That's the question. Are you nervous? - Just a bit. Relax, nothing can go wrong. Right? Hey, Joey! Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Hello! Thanks again, Mr. Douville. - I'll do everything I can, but there's no guarantee. - Yes, I know. Good luck. Goodbye. - Goodbye. My suspension won't help me. Look, don't worry, all right? Mr. Douville is a good agent. That'll help. This is it, son! Hi! How are you? - Fine! I just spoke to Buffalo's Chief Scout, and things are looking good! It doesn't matter, son. Not a bit. Damn that two-faced liar! I just spoke to him. Janeau must be disappointed. Buffalo would've been perfect. What's the second team again? - Nashville. This time, it's a sure thing. - Nashville! It's a very good team, Janeau. - I don't want to play there! Montreal is proud to select, from the Chicoutimi Saguenéens... Janeau Trudel! Montreal, Janeau! It's Montreal! It's Montreal! I didn't see that one coming! Congratulations. I love you, man! I knew I wouldn't be drafted. Be patient, it's far from over. They picked you! They picked you. Go on, go on! Yes! Thanks. I'm so proud of you, my son! I'm proud of you! Thanks, Mom. Congratulations. Have you been here long? From the beginning. I've been waiting for this forever. I know. I came to apologize. I have to tell you something. Douville called me and... I signed a contract with him. I know. I called him myself. I told him that if he wanted to represent you... I'd get out of the way. I'm proud of you, son. Take it. Yes. Everything's fine. My sweet mom... Watch out for the car! That's Trudel. - Janeau? Janeau! It's Janeau! I want an autograph! Bravo, Janeau! Congratulations, my boy! Bravo! - Thank you. Mike! It's been too long. - Congratulations, Janeau. Thank you... Jimmy! How are you? - Great! Bravo, Janeau! Good job! - Thanks, Steph. I'm really glad to see you guys! Seeing you, I remember all those great moments. Good friends are important. Joey's not here? No. We still haven't spoken. Really? When I was young, I wasn't able to keep my friends. My parents were always moving, so we lost touch. It was inevitable. But I'd have liked to make friends... and keep them all my life. It's cool to see everyone again. It's a nice surprise. It's crazy how things turned out. You'll get to play in Montreal! You're really lucky. Not that lucky. Why do you say that? Because I lost you. Janeau... - I still love you, Julie. I'd like you to forgive me so we can get back together. I'm enrolled in the Journalism Program of the Université de Lyon. In France? - Yes. I'm really happy for you, but... It's too late. - Julie... Yeah. Stay there! Stay there! I'll make a pass! To Catherine Howard, 1947-2017 Party's over. Let's go somewhere else. Yeah. Hey, man! Do you think we'll be in the third film? We could do a comeback with Janeau. When you party and you can feel it, you need a designated driver. While you're at it... choose someone with class!
