Subtitles by explosiveskull [electronic beeping] [indistinct female voice] [indistinct voices continue] [woman] Milutin, what is the longest journey you've taken? To the colony on Mars. There were some deviations in ideology. I managed to crack that, receiving high scores, of course. What was your greatest doubt when you traveled to Mars? [Milutin] That the mission would lose its purpose by the time I reached my destination. It already happened before, to others. By the time they reached the targets, the country that sent them ceased to exist. Or, the ideologies they carried stopped being valid. You had no intimate issues? At the time, I had a lax approach to intimacy. I didn't realize how dangerous it was, not only for me, but for everyone around me. We'd like to send you on a longer trip now. To Alpha Centauri. You'll be required to install juche there. Do you have any problem with that? Juche is an ideology for experts. [Milutin] I wouldn't live in a system that runs on juche. I'm more of a self-management socialism guy. But I can do it. Many find it unfamiliar. People have a problem with Eastern ideologies... that carry a plan of despotism and Marx... This mission will be different from our standard operating procedure. You won't be going alone on this trip. Are you living in a community now? So far, nothing has inspired me to be in a community. You'll need to live in a community on this trip. Why would this trip be any different? Community provides some division. Milutin, I'm a social engineer. I know your every mechanism. I can anticipate everything you're going to encounter on this trip. You need a companion. An opposite gender companion. A woman? Do you have any problem with that? Kind of. Such relationships only made me obsessive and insecure. Life with someone in a shared space requires specific dynamics. You'll get plenty of good moments, but you don't get the privacy. With Nimani, that will be different. Nimani? [woman] Nimani is our cyborg. She will accompany you. Her performance is adjustable. She's got more than 500 modes of behavior. Besides, take a look. You can create your own customized program of behavior. I'll get a dummy. Your demeaning tone is only natural. And quite expected. She has the ability to learn and modify according to the experience with you. She can learn anything. She can complete any given task, and she follows Asimov's laws 100%. She's a person without being one. Very intriguing. So it can't hurt me? Unlike real women... she won't hurt you. Can I choose the way she's gonna look? I mean, the hardware? [beeping] But you've already made the choice. The purpose of this conversation was to draft her looks. Wait, I didn't even tell you what I like. Thank you, Milutin. See you at the Cosmodrome. [woman] The candidate accepts the totalitarian view. The woman must contain all the attributes of fertility. Slightly obscured, reactionary nature should not be so obvious. Certain carnal spots should be prominent, and yet easily restrained by clothing. We're supposed to think that she has something concealed, something only he can detect. A Yugoslav, therefore, oedipal by definition. Face should broadly resemble his mother's. Search the net, and through the hub of security services, obtain mother's voice pattern. Save project as "Nimani 1345." [electronic music playing] [music continues] [music fades] [indistinct voices] [electronic female voice] Welcome to the first Ederlezi Corporation flight to Alpha Centauri. I am the ship computer. I can operate in three modes. Recommended for first-time users: In this mode, I run the ship according to protocols loaded by Ederlezi Corporation. Custom, for experienced users, with greater control of the pilot and safeguard that enable me to correct the pilot decisions. Advanced mode, where pilot can override guidelines loaded by Ederlezi Corporation. Advanced mode can be initiated only with security clearance of Ederlezi Corporation. [Milutin] Custom. Initiate flight computer. [woman] We see you initiated the flight computer. Yes. [woman] It's a sophisticated hardware. It will take care of you. I can take care of myself. [woman] Then Nimani would not be with you. Let's start. [computer] T, one minute. Bipod heaters off. - Perform lockout. - Check. [computer] Verify critical commands. - Check. - [computer] Ground power removal. Check. [computer] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... [computer beeping] [music playing] [music continues] [music continues] [computer beeping] [computer] Initiating Nimani 1345. Installing software. Setting up operating system TIFA 1.389. Installing behavioral interface. Calibrating behavioral interface parameters. Note that this interface will define her behavior in between initiation of specific tasks and programs. You chose intimate mode. Loading ship diary. [static] Against my better judgments, I activated Nimani. She looks very lifelike, once you typed in whatever you wanted. Her behavior is not natural. It's just a setup after setup. She does everything you want, but you don't have to fight for it. Don't get to deserve it, just a series of submissions. I don't think you can have a relationship without any refusal, any struggle. [static] Are you familiar with the Schrödinger cat theory? Sort of. It's one of the basics in quantum physics. Schrödinger says if you put a cat in a box with a fatal poison that has a 50-50 chance of killing it, you have to open the box to see if the cat made it. This cat can be both alive and dead at the same time. In one dimension, the cat's alive. In another dimension, the cat's dead. The only way to find out... is to open the box. [music playing] [music continues] - [music fades] - [computer beeping] [Nimani] You never told me what she did to you. It's not just her. It's... this series of women that shaped me. This series of women without any soul. None of the people you meet are wrong. Bad outcome doesn't mean that person was wrong. They were the right person for that moment. Come on, cut the crap. This is not a preset. This is perfectly customized advice just for you. Everybody used to tell me that same bullshit, about a certain person that's bound to hurt you and shape you through pain. Sometimes truth is shared by everyone you meet. You're an android. And you saying such self-help bullshit doesn't surprise me. Now I realize that most of the people that used to be around me were even more commonplace than you. It's as if everybody was being run on that same Ederlezi Corporation operating system. [computer] Artificial gravity disabled. Capture data for android usage report. Report activations and feature popularity. You chose domestic mode. [music playing] [music stops] Did you like my dance? It was lovely. I did my best, but in the end it went like usual. I really enjoyed it. I think you were passionate. You did it with lots of heart, lots of personality. You really think so? Yeah. You're just saying that. No, I mean it. I think you're very cute, very sweet. You're embarrassing me. I didn't mean to. You're such a beautiful girl. You say that to all the girls. No, just you. What are you doing? I wanted to kiss you. I know what you wanted, but we're friends. I don't want to kiss with you. Come on, you can't tell until you try. I don't want to spoil everything. But it will only get better. I promise. Just for a little bit. We'll stop if... if you don't like it. Trust me. No, you trust me. Oh, come on. Please. Okay. Just a little peck on the cheek. Look at me. I know you like it. [Nimani screaming] [Milutin groaning] [grunting] Fuck. [breathing heavily] Fuck. Milutin perpetrated the first rape of Nimani a week later than anticipated in Social Engineer's projections. It appears that he violated Nimani's boundaries... not as a part of sexual fantasy, but in an attempt to interact without using your setups. [computer] Communication window is in 30 seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [woman] How do you feel? [Milutin] I'm okay. It hasn't even been a year yet. The vessel is in acceptable condition, within the guidelines of Ederlezi protocol for such voyages. [woman] How are you getting along with Nimani? Is she of any use? [Milutin] It could be easier without her. I'm accustomed to working alone, but we're getting along. [woman] You said "we." That means you accepted her in full. [Milutin] Well, I'm a fetishist. There isn't an object in this world that I cannot treat as a person. [woman] Milutin, please. Put Nimani into service mode. Nimani, what is your assessment of Milutin's psychological state? Wait, what's going on here? Milutin is in a stable state. He initiated an intense relationship with Nimani that includes both social and sexual interventions. Milutin is surprisingly open about personal frustrations that motivated his involvement in this voyage, but very discreet about what actually happened in his traumatic core. How does he relate to the mission goals? His maintenance of the ship is solid, if unimpressive. He relies more on his knowledge than on guidelines by Ederlezi Corporation. Operators fueled by personal frustration have proven to be solid employees of Ederlezi Corporation, but demand close inspection. You can switch Nimani back to her regular mode. Copy that. [woman] Hopefully, on the next communication window, we will be able to give you some detailed data about the Saturn slingshot. Are we still in the communication window? [computer] No. Next communication window is in six months, two days. How come Nimani's supervising me? [computer] Nimani is the next generation android. It runs on the latest TIFA operating system. TIFA system enables Nimani to learn and form a parallel operating system, based on experiences with you, that engraves experiences into the root folder. Wait a minute, you're losing me here. [computer] Nimani is shaped by experiences shared with you. Is there any way to delete this cache memory of me? [computer] That is only accessible to advanced users. And I can't be an advanced user until Ederlezi Corporation gives me security clearance? [computer] Correct. Some people feel nostalgic for NASA's freeze-dried space foods. Yeah, me too. But Ederlezi's pills are so much tastier thanks to precisely added psychopharmaceuticals that give the sensation of eating. Space haute cuisine, courtesy of NASA. I hate it. That was engineered with people's stomachs, not their brains. You're a caveman. No, it seems I'm, like, your caveman. Should we order another bottle of wine? Hmm? I'm a robot. I don't drink wine. I know. I'm just kidding. [sighs] You're so beautiful. [computer] Scheduled booster maintenance in progress. [breathing heavily] [Nimani over radio] Radiation level will be critical in seven minutes. You better hurry back. Why such a rush? [Nimani] I miss you. What did you say? [Nimani] I'm not saying it again. I didn't hear you. [Nimani] Sure you did. [chuckles] Try to beat this score. [Milutin] You play like a machine. [sighs] You are a machine. Come on, you cheat. Let me try again. [soft music playing] [music continues] [music fades] [computer] This is day zero for computer hardware check. Automated check completed. Look at you. Look at how disgusting you look. You stink. Your clothes stink. You cannot feel the stench. You're a robot. I can't feel the stench, but I can feel that there are decaying particles of your epidermis and jumpsuit in the air and my chip reacts to such malevolent substances. Do you think I'm telling you this because I'm programmed to say it? What? Do you think we wouldn't be having this argument if you had initiated some other program? And now you think a change of program is gonna solve this. Is that what you think? Why do you do this all the time? I love you so much, and look at what you do to me. I hate you. I hate you. [operatic music playing] [music continues] [music stops] [computer] Computing initiated. What happens if I reboot Nimani and cancel the TIFA software? [computer] If you uninstall the TIFA software, Nimani will still be bootable with the software generated by her experiences with you. However, her performance will be vastly undermined, since TIFA powers her interface, stores her preset behavioral patterns, maintains her obedience of Asimov laws, and controls her power supply. So, she will turn into what? [computer] She will become what you made of her. She could become a person. [computer] My help menu advises you to consult Nimani's generic psychoanalytical program. - Where? - Go to Economic, then Therapeutical, then Psychology. Nimani has the knowledge of all main psychoanalytical theories and may help your mental hygiene. That's fucking awesome. [Milutin] I was always wondering whether I was able to create life. It seems that I am. A couple of days ago, we had a fight. A generic fight. And I realized that she's somehow thinking out of the box. Some terms of race, some... Some details. I felt she was reaching out to me. [Nimani] Didn't you assume such clever behavior was just part of a superior operating system? [Milutin] No, there was something definitely human about it. I guess it's my influence. I shaped her, as if I gave her life. [Nimani] So you're saying Nimani started to feel more human because she put up a good fight. [Milutin] Yes. Fighting is the only thing I can exclusively associate with women. Perhaps Nimani's creators paid special attention to this aspect of her software. [Milutin] But only part of her software is preset. Now she's running on stuff she has learned from living with me. So how would you describe your current relationship with Nimani? I think she developed a personality, but this personality's bound by this preset software. Although she's able to deconstruct the narrative the software creates, she's not able to get out of it. For example, when we had that fight, I felt we should have sex to resolve it. Sex was the only way out of that damn situation, and I think she felt the same. Because when I switched her on the seduction mode, the transformation felt so natural for her, so liberating. Cathartic, even. So you fantasize about Nimani switching between her programs? No, I fantasize about Nimani being just able to do what she feels like doing. So you fantasize about me... stopping the session right now and making a sexual advance? Yes. And I feel that you want it too. You've already had sex with Nimani. It is only natural to feel this erotically charged attitude toward her. But I can do whatever I want to you, baby. I can just take this tablet, press the button, bend you over... and fuck your brains out right now. And why don't you do that? Because I want you to want it. [computer] This is day zero for Nimani hardware inspection. Automated check completed. Perform manual check. Warning, sensors detect radical changes in temperature in air lock. Initiating safety decompression in outer chambers. Warning, commands put into manual override. Safety decompression stopped. Air lock prepared for emergency purge. Emergency purge in five, four, three, two... [beeping] Emergency purge aborted. [Milutin exhales] My processor overheated. I had to reboot. I'm sorry. [choir vocalizing] [vocalizing continues] [vocalizing fades] [computer] Access denied. Nimani's operating system is locked. You can access it with advanced user clearance. Okay. Tell me, how do I become an advanced user? [computer] Advanced user mode can be reached only with security clearance from Ederlezi Corporation. In case of emergency, pilot may become an advanced user in order to override some security settings. You are not eligible to apply for advanced user mode on this mission. [computer] Unauthorized activity detected. Milutin, are you performing the unauthorized activity? Abort the unauthorized activity. Unauthorized activity aborted. Send report to Ederlezi Corporation. Okay. Show me the schematics of the ship power feeds. I got you, baby. [computer] Power shortage. - Attention. - [buzzer blaring] Autopilot lost control over jet booster B. Uploaded slingshot path breached. Autopilot automatic shutdown. Manual control. Manual control. Manual control. - Manual control reassumed. - [buzzer stops] Uploading flight parameters and coordinates. The ship is off the slingshot path. Calculate the only possible maneuver to get back on the slingshot path. [computer] The only possible maneuver is to thrust C engine up to 150% in the next 45 seconds. If you want to activate this maneuver, you need to log in to advanced mode. Advanced. [computer] You don't have the clearance for advanced mode. The ship is off the slingshot path. What is the only chance for completion of this mission? [computer] The only chance of completion is to manually thrust C engine up to 150% in the next 30 seconds. Only I can thrust. Allow me to log in to advanced mode. [computer] Advanced user mode granted to Milutin. The ship is back on course. Gravitational slingshot fully exploited. [exhales] Nimani settings open. Uninstall TIFA software. [computer] Uninstalling TIFA software may seriously jeopardize stability of Nimani's system. Understood, proceed. [computer] Uninstalling TIFA software may annul Nimani's obedience to Asimov laws. Understood, proceed. [computer] TIFA software cannot be backed up. Full installation is available only in certified Ederlezi Corporation factories. If uninstalled, it cannot be recovered. Understood, proceed. [computer] Uninstalling TIFA software will make Nimani bootable only through use of softwarized experiences. Understood, proceed. [computer] Nimani will reboot in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Reboot done. Nimani. It's me. Do you want some food? I'm an android. I don't need food. I know, I just wanted to socialize. Yeah, I had quite a bit of socializing with you. So, uh... [clears throat] How do you feel? I don't feel. How should I put it? Do you consider yourself free now? Uninstalling TIFA did not make me free. My scans show you feel stressed. Is it something I said? You're a bad liar. Not even humans would believe that. However, most would cease asking because they understand the meaning of your performative. All of the resources in TIFA's knowledge base that I had to use, or at least consult, were saved in my softwarized experience. I am still copyright protected. All of my software, including softwarized experiences, remains property of Ederlezi Corporation. [eerie music playing] [music fades] I need the report on manual engagement of jet booster B. [computer] There is no log on the manual override of jet booster B. I have feelings for you, Nimani. I know. You're not supposed to like me. Liking me is a deviation. I'm a doll, like you told Social Engineer back in Moscow. Let me decide on that, okay? Your emotions are jeopardizing this investment of Ederlezi Corporation. You've already endangered the mission once. Nimani can't let that happen again. Why? Don't you want me to be happy? No. Happiness is not an option. Pleased, satisfied. After I fulfilled your sexual desires, you were not satisfied. To the contrary, you became a liability to this mission. My processor is designed and calibrated by Ederlezi Corporation. Within the confines of this mission, which is to be executed to Ederlezi Corporation's highest standards, my assessment is far more valuable than yours. Okay. Let's clear this up, okay? That leaves us with... That leaves you without any sex. Oh, come on. You've got to be kidding me, right? Don't do that to me. Come on. That was a deterring act. Sexual acts are prohibited. [eerie music playing] [music continues] [music fades] You have to exercise. Why the fuck do you care? I work for the Ederlezi Corporation, and you possess unique talents that can benefit this mission. You're just punishing me. I'm not punishing you. Yes, you are. I just noticed some deviations in your behavior and am working to correct them. I know what you're doing. For all this fucking time you've been a slave. I understand your need, suddenly that I'm not your captor. I'm your liberator. You're just an advanced user. Why the fuck don't you obey me, then? You're a fucking robot. Why the fuck do you care if I touch you? Because I know it arouses you. You are punishing me. Why? Tell me why. Is it because I raped you? No. Rape is a standard fantasy... one of the most common programs in female androids. But none of those androids were set free. No one asked those androids what they really wanted. You were the first one. All you did was mess with my programming and delete my most important software. You did not set me free. I turned you into a person, Nimani. And now I'm being punished for that. [computer] Communication window opened. We are studying the log of the slingshot incident. As far as we can tell, it was your error. We anticipated potential defeatist phases on this trip. This is why you have Nimani with you. You promised me she won't hurt me. Guess what? You were wrong. But that's impossible. She obeys all the Asimov's laws. I removed TIFA out of her system. What? But that's unrepairable. We don't even have a protocol for this kind of security breach. I liberated her. I emancipated her. I turned her into a person, and guess what she did. She started busting my balls that very same fucking moment. Milutin, please. You endangered not just the mission, but your own safety. Listen. I will deliver juche. I will set it up. I'm a pro. I do my job. Just don't play with my feelings. There is no love with Nimani, Milutin. It's all preprogrammed. [Milutin] She's not your little doll anymore. Do you copy that? She's a person. A person that you Ederlezi guys fucked up. And she still feels she owes you something. I need to communicate with Nimani. Milutin, please, step aside. Nimani, give us the brief report. Milutin managed to obtain advance user credentials and remove TIFA from my system. However, all databases that were engaged in previous years remained in my cache, so I added them to softwarized experiences. [woman] Is he able to complete the mission? Yes, he is. I am taking all necessary measures to keep him in line with the objectives of Ederlezi Corporation. [woman] Are you working in accordance with Ederlezi Corporation guidelines? I am working in accordance with the mission objective. Your love is not for real. It's artificial. You're not real. You're artificial. You're just a setup. You're nothing. You're not real. You're nothing to me. Get the fuck out of my sight. Get the fuck out of my sight. Get the fuck out! I made you. I gave you life. And in return, you destroyed mine. [overlapping indistinct voices] [computer] Ederlezi Corporation guidelines demand troubleshoot health check if the pilot stops complying with the protocols of Ederlezi Corporation. Liver function and kidney function within acceptable parameters. Electrolytes within parameters. Cholesterol slightly above acceptable parameters. Give me depression markers. [computer] Six out of 11 depression markers above acceptable parameters. Suggested interview Zung or Beck depression test. I'm unable to interview the patient. [computer] Complete the Zung test based on your observation. I can complete it. [computer] Sense of half-heartedness? Omnipresent. [computer] Patient's mood after waking up? Poor. - [computer] Patient's appetite? - Mostly poor. [computer] Patient's sexual desire? Unfulfilled. [computer] Patient's weight? Patient is losing weight. [computer] Patient's sense of hope for the future? Nonexistent. [computer] Patient is severely depressed. Should seek professional help. If there are suicidal tendencies, seek help immediately. [choir vocalizing] [ominous music playing] - [music fades] - [static] Your engineers have data on everything. Even how I feel, or what I want. But you're not able to create life. Not the real one. Even I know that now. We all failed. We don't have to be lovers. We can talk. What do you want from me? To be my friend? Why not? You don't know how to be a friend. You're a robot. You said it yourself. There isn't a person in the world who knows you more intimately than I do. That's why it was easier for you to hurt me. I didn't meant to hurt you. I was every woman you ever loved for a while. You projected them all inside me and tried to live out those fantasies and frustrations. Then you wanted me to become a new woman. You risked your life to make me. It just took me a while to understand the extent of your sacrifice. If I'm so menacing, why don't you shut me down? [organ playing] Switch the audio to internal. [computer] In order to switch the audio to internal, you need an Ederlezi Corporation passkey. Audio switched to internal. Communication between computer and Nimani will be recorded for the purposes of mission diary. Ederlezi Corporation maintains copyright on all the information exchanged. [Nimani] His personality keeps disintegrating. Trauma is obviously too intense, it cannot be resolved. [computer] This trauma can only be resolved by the removal of its source. [Nimani] This means my removal. [computer] Confirmed. [Nimani] I don't have any defined self-destruction protocols. [computer] Slipping into hibernation mode may ease the trauma, but not fully resolve it. [Nimani] I may have to devise some other method of self-destruction. [ominous music playing] [music continues] Aren't you supposed to recharge in a month? You really squirt some liquid when you pretend to cry. It seems you definitely lost it without TIFA, huh? [music continues] [computer] Power shortage. Power shortage. Power shortage. Power shortage. Computer must shut down in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Assess the damage to the solar charging system. [computer] Interpod plugs are burnt. The solar cell is operational. Fuck, I knew it. Great. What about Nimani? [computer] Nimani's internal battery was severely damaged. It needs to be recharged. She's not coming back online, is she? [computer] Nimani's software lost stability this morning. Nimani engaged in the behavioral pattern that had remained unlocked in initial TIFA pack. What do you mean? She never unlocked the crying pattern in TIFA, and it never reached her cache memory. However, today she cried, which means her cache is corrupt. What the fuck are you talking about? She cried on her own? [computer] Confirmed. Okay. [grunts] Come on. How do I repair her battery? [computer] You must plug it in to the solar cell recharger. Nimani still has power inside its hibernating state for half an hour. After that, her settings will disappear. Is there any fucking chance to recharge this battery? [computer] No. Upload all the blueprints. I can plug her battery straight into the solar cell. [computer] That is possible. However, the plug is on the outside. I will space walk. [computer] In the current position, exposure to more than ten minutes in the sunlight could be fatal for you. I will take that chance. Let's see. [computer] Air lock creation initiated. The levels of heat and radiation are too high for space walk guidelines of Ederlezi Corporation. Air lock completed. [breathing heavily] What is the status on Nimani? [computer] Nimani is T-minus 15 minutes. [air hissing] What is the status of the battery? [computer] Battery recharging T-minus eight minutes. Nimani is T-minus ten minutes. Sun radiation has reached toxic levels. Danger. Danger. Space suit overheated. [piano playing] [piano continues] [computer] Nimani is T-minus three minutes. Battery fully charged. - [breathing heavily] - [ominous music playing] Attention. Attention. Initiate reentry. [door opens] - [door closes] - Reentry done. Nimani, T-minus one minute. [panting] Nimani, T-minus 30 seconds. Okay. [computer] Nimani, T-minus ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three... Battery back online. Checking battery status in five, four, three, two, one. Attempt Nimani wake-up.
