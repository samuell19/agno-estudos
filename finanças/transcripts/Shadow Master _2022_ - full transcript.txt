[introductory theme music] [glass shatters] [blood drips] [intense music playing] [punches thrown] [indistinct radio chatter] Go, go, go, go. [indistinct whispering] [door slams] [indistinct radio chatter] [punches and kicks thrown] [electricity crackles] [indistinct radio chatter] [over comms] We have a code. [indistinct radio chatter] What the fuck. [tense music playing] [over comms] Who's that? DET. RUSSELLS: [indistinct]. Drop him! [glass shatters] [helicopter revving] [siren wailing] [door opens, closes] HANUMAN: [voice-over] Tell him about the end times. The war will ascend. How about we start with you telling me your name. John. John what? Doe. You think this is a game? That's what you can call me. Look, I'm your friend. I'm here to help. We found you in that building surrounded by 18 dead bodies. No one else in sight. So we need some answers. And hey, maybe you didn't do it. I'm here to help you. But you have to give me the truth... unless you have something to confess. God is always listening. Can God forgive the devil? So you did do it? [ominous whispering] I've seen it all, John. Setting up an insanity plea doesn't quite work that way. Now, I'm going to need you to walk me through every step of this. My team reports state that they found your belongings in the security room, so you're a security guard? Night Watchman. Fine. We'll start there. When did your employment begin? [thunder roaring] JOHN: [voice-over] I needed a place to stay and I heard a radio message. It said in exchange for food and shelter, they needed a Night Watchman. [thunder roaring] [door hinges squeak] [thunderclaps] Who are you? My name is An Voaen. What you doing here? [over radio] Night Watchman needed. Food and shelter for work. Location: [indistinct] hospital. [continues indistinctly] - [laughs] That's me. I didn't think anyone would come. Most of the people that come here, they've lost hope in life. Job still available? Oh, yeah. Sorry. [chuckles] You'll do just fine. Welcome. Come on. Let's go. Yeah. [unsettling music playing] You got a good privacy here. Everybody else on the fourth floor. Come on. It's okay. Your own place. I'll show you. - [light switch clicks] - BOON-NAM: Ey-ya! Dewitt. Huh. What are you doing there? Usual. Watching over Mom. [chuckles] This is Dewitt. Her mom, many years ago, went crazy. Like way crazy. [whistles] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Move, move, move. [speaks in foreign language] This is An's room now. So you're the new Night Watchman? AN VOAEN: Yeah. BOON-NAM: You cannot leave your stuff here. I'll meet you at the canteen. We'll get you some food. [thunderclaps] DEWITT: So... you ever fought before? I will fight if I have to. Well, when you have to fight, are you any good? [screams in pain] [breathing heavily] Help! [loud clattering] [punches and kicks thrown] Aaaahhh! [punches and kicks thrown] [table clatters] [punches and kicks thrown] AN VOAEN: [voice-over] I used to fight but I lost control. I had to learn to keep it all inside. Fighting only causes pain. DEWITT: [scoffs] A Night Watchman too afraid to fight. Now I've seen everything. [sighs] [man sniffling] JANETT: Are you the new Night Watchman? Yeah. This is the bad time of the month. The 15th day, the seventh month onwards, the month of the Fantasma Briento. I'm sorry? The hungry ghosts. Ghosts? Don't tell me I'm looking for ghosts. It's not ghosts we're afraid of. I'm Janett. This is my son, Ben is on. Hi, Janett. Ben is on. Thank you for being here. We truly are grateful. Especially at night, when they come. [wheelchair squeaking] [over PA] Food rations are now available at the canteen. DEWITT'S MOM: [singing] ♪ New guy new guy ♪ DEWITT: Oye! Zip it! [over PA] Only one ticket per person. Not so fast. Here. Take this. This is how we organize our rations. You know, food. COOK: Take a seat. I'll get you your meal in a moment. Hey, new Night Watchman. [speaks in foreign language] You know, I... I wish we had some money for you. No, I'm just grateful for the meal. I can't afford a meal. BOON-NAM: Yeah. You haven't tried the cooking yet. [laughs] Just kidding. Ah, she's a pretty good cook. At least your job will be easy. I mean, nobody comes around here anymore. Not since what happened with the, yeah, well, you know. What happened? BOON-NAM: Eh, children went missing in the night. Then end times prophesizes when children go missing, evil grows stronger. It might happen again, but that's why you're here... To protect us. In case this gets worse. Child went missing? You know, ghosts come at night. Kids are sleeping, nice and quiet. Ghosts come in? Oh. Gho... Did I say ghosts? I mean, one second, a child is there and the next second, poof, gone. Where did it come from? Hm. That's a good question. Yeah. Hah. [speaks in foreign language] It wards off the evil... Ghosts, demons, and worse. There he goes again with that voodoo shit. It's not voodoo. And it's not shit! That's Hanuman. He's the Monkey King. Very strong. He gives them to everyone who comes here. Nobody wears that. [speaks in foreign language] Yeah. You hang on to that. Keep it in your pocket. That's Janett and Ben is on. I met them earlier. Yeah. She's still freaked out about that kid missing. Holds her son's hand so tight, gonna squeeze it off. Hm. Hey, she like you. She looking at you. But, mm... You don't wanna get involved with a single mom, right? All right, see the little blonde boy? That's Dylan. Best friends with Ben is on. [sighs] Too bad those two have to grow up in this crazy world. These ghosts... where do they come from? I don't know. I've never seen them before. It just happened so fast. AN VOAEN: What are they doing with the kids? Who knows? Forced marriage, crime, labor, sex. Did I say sex? [sighs] Ay-ya, eeh. Get that out of my head. I'm sorry. Here. Eat your food. Come on. You must be hungry. Where's the beef? AN VOAEN: [voice-over] That night, while doing my rounds, I realized the people here, the mother Janett, the old man Boon-Nam, they were all keeping secrets. [over PA] Curfew is in effect. All lights [indistinct] will be shut off [indistinct] ten minutes. Please return to your quarters. - [man laughing] SANTA MARIA: [whispering] Evil lairs. Evil inside these walls. [unsettling music playing] SANTA MARIA: The end times draw near. I can see your past. TRIAD LEADER: Hey, pal. You were supposed to set up a peace treaty with me and the leader of the Eighth Street Gang. What the hell happened? They threw the first punch. Well... I sent you there because you could fight, but it ended up costing me. Now, if they're to consider a peace treaty, they want your head. Nothing personal. It's just business. [suspenseful music playing] [punches and kicks thrown] [man grunts] Yah. [punches and kicks thrown] - Aaahhhhh! - [bones breaking] - [punch thrown] - [growls] [punches and kicks thrown] [grunting in pain] [An Voaen gasps loudly] [man screaming in pain] [panting] Ah, sheesh. You're just getting used to things. You're just getting used to things. You're just getting used to things. [exhales] [woman crying] There's a child missing. No knows if it's ghosts or demons. Not like you and me. Ugh, dumb-ass. Why are the cops here? They don't care what happens here. Nobody cares. [woman crying] This happened last night? Yeah. Don't worry. Nobody blames you. They're just worried about the kids. [sniffs] What's that smell? Oh, sorry. No, it's not that. WOMAN: [crying] Please find my baby. I don't know what to do. Nothing. Was it Dylan? I don't know. I have to go find Dylan. I'm afraid it's him this time. JANETT: Ben is on? Ben is on. I told you to never leave my side. I was just looking for Dylan. JANETT: That's not Dylan's mom. I think he's okay. How did I not see them? Don't blame yourself. When you have time, come by the apartment. We have something for you. Okay. That smell keeps giving me a headache. [thunderclaps] [door creaks opens] Hey. [plate clanks] [thunderclaps] Did you want something? Yeah. Um... I noticed when you came in that you only had one bag. That's all I have. Here. What is that? I told you before. Fantasma Briento. Oh, right. Hungry Ghosts Month? I saw some other people put them out. Boon-Nam says that's your thing. We leave offerings for the dead, hoping that the spirits of those who died here will take care of our children. Surprised more people believe in that stuff. You're wearing Boon-Nam's amulet. He chooses to pray to gods for protection and I choose to give hope instead. I don't believe in this stuff. Where's his father now? Met someone younger. Left and never looked back. So did they hire you because you can fight? [flashback] Aahhh! That's what they're counting on. Have you ever been a Night Watchman? No. I guess we'll take what we can get, huh? They're frightened and desperate. Any idea who's behind all this? No. But I heard a name. Mephisto. Say that again. Mephisto. What else did you hear? I heard about the Four Horsemen, how they plan to use the souls of children to bring about the end times. Mephisto kidnaps children. That's how the evil grows more powerful. Once the evil is strong enough, they will have a ceremony and it will end everything. Well, that's not what my team has determined. Half your team is dead because of the evil. In order to stop the apocalypse, one has to kill all of the Four Horsemen. The thing is, the Four Horsemen look the same as everyone else. They look like me. They look like you. DET. RUSSELLS: Let's be clear. Half my team is dead because of you. But let's get back to your story. You say you saw the Four Horsemen. Some thought they were ghosts. Some thought they were demons. I knew the truth. I start killing them, one by one. SANTA MARIA: You're on the right track, Night Watchman. The evil grows strong underground. [soft music playing] [ominous sound plays] [device crackles] [crackling swells] [sighs] [ominous music playing] [gasps] SANTA MARIA: You can feel the evil inside. It calls your name. [evil laughter] [breathes deeply] [door opens] Hey! Drop the kid! Get him. [punches and kicks thrown] [An Voaen groaning] [fast heartbeats] [kicks thrown] [pounding heartbeats] [distant chanting] [wheels rolling] [kids crying] MEPHISTO: Bring the child. The Babylon of perfection. [indistinct] their innocence is my hunger. I need more children. Only need. Not we need. Just one more child for each of us. [kids crying] Our communion will be complete with these children. As Horsemen, we will ride a wave of blood that ushers in the apocalypse. All we need is two more children. It is much too soon, Samael. It is not your job to tell us when or how we do things. It is never too soon to feed off the young. Let's get ready. And soon, we will be unstoppable. BOON-NAM: An? He's still breathing. Come on. He's losing too much blood. JANETT: What are we gonna do? He's gonna die. BOON-NAM: That's okay, don't worry. JANETT: He's not gonna make it. BOON-NAM: I'm trying, okay? I have no choice. [indistinct conversation echoes] JANETT: I need you to pay attention. We're gonna lose him. Do anything. BOON-NAM: Drink something. Please. [sighs] Nothing. Nothing. Is there anything else we can do? Yeah. Keep praying. An-an, you can do this. I believe in you. BOON-NAM: [voice-over] Death is not the end. There is still another way. Make sure he is cleaned properly with water from the blessed sacrament. There is a chance we can bring him back from the dead if we are lucky. [water dripping] [rhythmic drumbeats] [praying in foreign language] [screaming in pain] [foreboding music playing] [screaming in pain] HANUMAN: [voice-over] Death is calling. But yet you summoned me. Don't you know there are things worse than death? [screaming in pain] HANUMAN: [voice-over] You [indistinct] of pain. You come to my world seeking life. One foot in hell and another on Earth. But you are still here where death is but inches from you. [indistinct]. Will they know who I am? I'm Hanuman. In the end times, I will give you a second chance on earth. Do as I say. Return to the land of the living. I will summon you when the time comes. [high-pitched ringing] BOON-NAM: I got you. I got you. [high-pitched ringing continues] Where is Janett? She's upstairs with Ben is on, giving him a bath. I need to thank her. Hey. You'll be okay. I got you. I got you. When did you get up? Do you need something to eat? My head hurts really bad. You have a fever. Your body is healing. It's okay. I've been seeing some things. I... I... shh. Not... not here. Not in public. Did you do something to me? Shh. Not here. Okay. I got you. Come on. Let's take you somewhere else. [door opens] Quite a collection. Yes. This is my family's legacy. You know, when I was in the hospital with the theta variant, my mom, she would tell me stories. The hospital closed, and I spent three years trying to find them. Trying to figure out why they never came back for me. I found out they were dead. You never lived in a regular house? No, I was just 16. Deeds were turned back to the government. I salvaged what I could, brought it back here, and made this my home. You believe in all this? I mean, it's about protection and all, but sometimes I wonder, what is it protecting us from? Maybe even ourselves. [gate opening] [lively chattering] I want out. And where are you gonna go? Rival gang's looking for you. Police. Hm? In fact, I think I'll be doing you a favor. Bringing them your head now. This ends tonight. Get rid of him. Haah! [kicks and punches thrown] [laughs] [machete clanking] [chains clanking] [machete man choking] [swords clanking] [choking, agonal gasp] You okay? You got a ritual to make me stop hallucinating? That's what I need. Remember, Hanuman needs a host. He may try to control you, but he cannot kill you. I need to do my rounds. He's right. I've seen people possessed before. There's always an explanation. The mind is a powerful thing. Let's get back to Mephisto and these Horsemen. You think that they kidnapped the children, hm? Don't you? You want to know what I think? I think this is all bullshit you made up because you failed to do your job. AN VOAEN: I came here because I intend to save the stolen children. DET. RUSSELLS: You came here because you were arrested. You see, those children... I'm going to prove that you took them. What if the truth is more than that? [lock locking] BENISON: Mister An? What are you doing? I locked the door, making sure no one gets in or out. What are you doing here? Where's your mom? She's waiting for some supper from Auntie Charlotte. I told her I'm gonna talk to you. Sure. What you got on your mind? Where is Dylan? Are you going to find him? I miss him. I'm gonna find him. I think you can protect us all. I can barely protect myself. But you look strong. This body can take a beating. I admit that. Mister An, are you okay? Yeah. Adults, you know, we think too much. You're a good man. That's a first. You know, my mom always says when you see someone, always close your eyes. Because you can only know someone when you feel them. Try it. I know. Try it. Okay. Follow me. HANUMAN: [voice-over] Before the boy, I know what you are. A killer. Kill the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and anyone that stands in our way. See. I can feel what a good man you are, and you're going to protect us all. HANUMAN: [voice-over] The boy is wrong. SANTA MARIA: [voice-over] Go with them. BENISON: Pinky promise? - I promise. - [door opens] JANETT: Ben is on. You're looking better. Have you been resting? I never got a chance to thank you. - I didn't do anything. - Yes, you did. You took care of me when I needed it most. You saved me. HANUMAN: [voice-over] We'll kill her too, if she tries to stop us. Stay in your rooms tonight. HANUMAN: [voice-over] I can see what you are. [ominous whispering] Tonight will still proceed. [ominous whispering continues] You can smell it, can't you? The hunger. Go and hide yourself. Go. [clanks] [smoke hissing] [door creaks open] [suspenseful music playing] Hey! Ben is on! Drop the kid. Aaaaahhhhhhh! [kicks and punches thrown] HANUMAN: [voice-over] [indistinct] Get up. AN VOAEN: [grunting] HANUMAN: I will not deny the power of the body. Rise and destroy them. You ain't getting up from that one. It's finished. [chains clanking] [spits] HANUMAN: We had a deal. You give me blood, I give you life. [screams in pain] [breathing heavily] What the hell? HANUMAN: [voice-over] Tear their flesh. Rip their souls. [grunting] [screams in pain] [body thuds] Give me the boy. Give me the boy! [panting] [grunting] [screams] HANUMAN: [voice-over] [indistinct]. [grunting in pain] HANUMAN: [voice-over] [indistinct] until I know. [ashtray thuds] [lighter clicks] Let me get this straight. You made a deal with the devil, and it's consuming your soul every time you fight. Death God. Right. Death God. So it just came right out and made a deal with you. Like that? Must have been something Boon-Nam did when I was on the brink of death. A curse? Depends on what you think of as a curse. Some may want this curse. Well, it's kept you alive this far. Barely. Can't say much for the rest of them. What happened next? JANETT: [cries loudly] Ben is on! BOON-NAM: What the hell? JANETT: They took Ben is on. My baby. Ben is on! Ben is on. They took him. They took him. COOK: Keep still. BOON-NAM: Where's An? They took him. They took Ben is on. [ominous whispering] HANUMAN: [voice-over] For each soul you take, each time you spill blood, a little more of your soul belongs to me. [sobs quietly] [wheels rolling] MASKED WOMAN: The child we brought back is awake, Mephisto. Immunity builds quick. We should have enough to get the last one. You join him with the rest. [gate opens, closes] Be comfortable, my children. Patience, 'cause there's only one more. We should begin the ritual, Mephisto. Not until we have the last child. [kids crying] HANUMAN: [voice-over] Here they come [indistinct]. Now is your chance. Which one should we get this time? Doesn't matter. Whatever we find next. Tell me where the kids are! [stab thrown] [kick thrown] [samurai sword clanks] [kicks and punches thrown] HANUMAN: [voice-over] Another dead body. AN VOAEN: [screaming in pain] HANUMAN: [voice-over] Can you feel our powers growing stronger? AN VOAEN: [screaming in pain] HANUMAN: [indistinct] more blood. [indistinct]. More vengeance for your soul. MEPHISTO: A metamorphosis, you say? MASKED WOMAN: Shapeshifting perhaps. He was turning into something. SAMAEL: Turning? MASKED WOMAN: How has the Night Watchman grown so strong? This man is the work of the devil himself. SAMAEL: How about is it done? MEPHISTO: A demon inside his body. SAMAEL: [indistinct], especially the old man. I think he answers to some kind of Death God. MEPHISTO: If it's human, we can still kill it. MASKED MAN: There is no other god. MEPHISTO: Kill the body and the demon dies with it. MASKED WOMAN: [voice-over] There is no time. The demon's fusing itself to the man's body. If too much time passes, Hanuman manifests its physical form through his flesh. MEPHISTO: If he is trying to kill the Four Horsemen to stop the Apocalypse, then our aim is to kill the Night Watchman. MASKED WOMAN: We have enough children to start the ritual for our essentials. Let us begin. DET. RUSSELLS: So, they came for you this time, huh? Why do you want to call it now? Self-defense? I'm not looking for forgiveness. Then give me a confession. This is the confession. The story. The journey... Detective. [ominous whispering] JANETT: An. Is that where the children are? The evil is behind the door. The children won't be alive much longer. And the only way to end this is to give up what's left of my soul to Hanuman. I might have to lure them out. It's gonna be very dangerous. The kids are living on borrowed time. What can we do to help? I could save the children. But you're gonna have to do exactly as I say. Gather the others, wall yourselves in. Don't answer to anyone including me. No matter what happens, stay inside. You could pray to whatever god you believe in, but tonight only one will answer: Death. [electricity crackling] [all groan] Let this be God. [electricity crackles] MASKED MAN: He turned it off. MASKED WOMAN: He's luring us. MEPHISTO: Take him out! SAMAEL: No. I got him this time. [suspenseful music playing] Control the exit. [door opens] [suspenseful music playing] Let me see. Hanuman. The glory of Rama. God of fighting. King of fighting, huh? Well, let's see what it can do. [punches and kicks thrown] MASKED MAN: [grunting] MASKED MAN: [grunting] [groans] AN VOAEN: [grunts] Something's wrong. [choking] [An Voaen screaming in pain] We have to help him. You said he wants us to stay here, no matter what happens. Something is wrong. AN VOAEN: [screaming in pain] So? Are you gonna help or what? [choking] You fight with no conviction. [choking] This is how you die. [choking] Let him go. SAMAEL: Look at this bitch. Always have someone helping you, huh? [whip snaps] [coughs blood] Sure you know how to use that? We fight in numbers. I'll be back with more. It's over. Where's Ben is on? I ain't tellin' you shit. Get him! [door closes] No! No! No, no, no. Stop! Stop! Don't go there. I'm gonna kill you. You can't hide forever, motherfucker! Let me go. No. I wanna get my son. Okay, okay. We'll come another time. Fuck! [grunting] HANUMAN: [voice-over] You are not done with the slaughter yet. [knife clanks] HANUMAN: [voice-over] [indistinct] isn't gonna escape from our deal. [stabs knife] [breathing heavily] HANUMAN: That's how it works despite your first guide. That's not why I killed myself. HANUMAN: [indistinct] thoughts went through your head. I needed to find a way... to my darkness. Palace of the Death God. HANUMAN: [indistinct] soul. A deal was done without my assent. What if I give it to you fully... right now? HANUMAN: There is no going back once you take out my full power. Mm-hm. HANUMAN: Your body and soul will be mine for eternity. And I will be rewarding the [indistinct]. AN VOAEN: Do it! Do it. [clanking] HANUMAN: So be it. You got the staff of Hanuman. Become the darkness. - [metal pipe clanks] - [grunts] HANUMAN: Return to your world one last time. Show them [indistinct]. [indistinct] your body and soul. Unlimited powers... [loud scream] HANUMAN: [indistinct] and your body will become mine. [indistinct] my power [indistinct] every soul. [loud clank] - SAMAEL: Fuck. - [loud thud] He had some help. MEPHISTO: The squatters are beginning to revolt. They find strength and resolve in his presence. I'm gonna fucking kill them next time. MASKED WOMAN: But you could do with a little help. MEPHISTO: Your goal is to find a weakness to sever the ties between this Night Watchman and his Death God. SAMAEL: What? MASKED WOMAN: Fight Eastern gods with Eastern magic. Nam man prai, corpse oil. That is the weakness of the spirits who have crossed over. We need the body of a pregnant woman who died a tragic death, [indistinct] we extract it by burning the chin the cursed candle until the oil forms. MEPHISTO: Use this to stop him. But be warned, it only works for a short time. An? I've been looking all over for you. I thought you were dead. You look different. I'm gonna get the children back. I will not fail this time. We tried chasing him. They disappeared behind the door again. That door. [Janett praying in Spanish] What did you say? The legend goes that if you pray to the statue of Santa Maria, she will point you the right way. Point? Give you guidance, you know? WOMAN: [voice-over] All is not lost. You can still save them by redeeming yourself. An? An? An, where are you going? Just stay here. [panting] Okay, Santa Maria, I'm here. What are you trying to tell me? [door unlocking] HANUMAN: [voice-over] There is no turning back now. [door opening] [device crackling] [distant water dripping] [foreboding music playing] HANUMAN: [voice-over] Find the last Horseman of the Apocalypse. [indistinct]. [distant screaming] [flashlight clicks] [door opens] [chains clanking] [door closes] Aaaaaaahhhhhh! [pole clanks] SAMAEL: You're like a fucking rat. Give me the kids. Go. I can't do that. It's time. MEPHISTO: Take him out, Samael, and be quick about it. Aaah! [pipe whipping through the air] [beads thudding] [smashing pipe] MASKED WOMAN: [grunts] [kids groan] SAMAEL: Yah! [glass clanks] How's it feel? Powerless? Scared? Fucking weak? You got nothing now. Where's your God now? HANUMAN: [voice-over] [indistinct]. AN VOAEN: [grunting] [bones cracking] [kicks and punches throwing] [gate clanks] [kicks and punches thrown] Hanuman [indistinct]. [grunting] [blood splatters] Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh! How does it feel, Death God? Like the pain? Fucking powerless? [blood splattering] [grunting, choking] AN VOAEN: Yaaahhh! [grunting] [bones breaking, blood splattering] [ominous whispering] BENISON: Mister An. Stay away from me. Don't worry. We're here for you. [uplifting music playing] AN VOAEN: [groans] [dramatic music playing] A demon, huh? Great story. Tragic ending. So you didn't get Mephisto, I see. Not yet anyway, but he's sitting right in front of me. What the hell are you talking about? I know it was you. I remember that smell like the first time I smelled it. The smell of evil and death. The first time I saw you guys, I didn't think much at first... until you came. Your stench, Mephisto, never lies. Aaaahh! What the hell are you talking about? I let myself get caught. I had to make sure. Bullshit! [scoffs] We meet without the mask, Mephisto. You're gonna accuse me based on smell? See, the thing about being the Death God is... you can see the dead. WOMAN: Don't kill him. You can feel little [indistinct]. An, you have a choice. Don't kill him. - You kill me, everyone in the hospital will be prosecuted or worse. Your fault. [indistinct]'s the bad guy. Bad, good... it's a human construct. I'm just Hanuman and you're just a man. [handcuff clanks] [door slams shut] I will still ascend. I'm a Death God. I will take you there personally. [blood splattering] HANUMAN: [voice-over] You please the Death God. Now [indistinct] is finally complete. [indistinct] has folded. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are killed. Our deal is done. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. HANUMAN: [voice-over] [indistinct] power, you wielded the staff. You spilled the blood. And now, your body belongs to me. KID: I want you to stay. MAN: You can stay with us. - WOMAN: Yeah. Thank you. - WOMAN: Thank you very much. KID: Please stay. You gave us hope. [ominous music playing] HANUMAN: [voice-over] And the doom world is so divided. I am Hanuman. The harbinger of pain and suffering. Nothing will stand in my way. Let the piles of the dead stack all the way to heaven's gate. Now begins the end time. Death is calling. [ending music theme playing] [music fades out]
