(train horn blares) - Hot out there. - What you doin' over here? - Well I had to get out of there for a few minutes. - Go on back over there. - Well I don't like it, she oughta be in a hospital. - That's for me and Crawther to worry about. - Well it's for me to worry about. I'm the one that has to take care of her. I'm damn sick of it. - I'm damn sick of your complaining. Crawther's the doctor, he'll handle it. - Crawther's a foll, he'll do anything you say. - That's for Crawther to worry about. - Look, I think I know what you're doing and I don't like it. - You don't know nothing, now you listen to me-- - No you listen to me. I stood by you all these years. Take care of you when you're sick, sleep with you at your convenience. Well I've seen you do a lot of things and I kept my mouth shut but I've never seen you do nothin' like this. What is that medicine I'm givin' her anyway? - Annie, one thing you never used to do was stick your nose in my business and you had better not start doin' it now in your old age. - Well I want you to call her granddaughter. - Dammit, keep her out of this! I don't want that girl here meddling in my business. Go on back over there and take care of Miss Harriet like I'm tellin' ya. - You're not gonna call her? Well then I am. (screams) - Annie, now you listen good 'cause I'm only gonna say this one time. Don't call that girl. (slap, scream) You understand? Now you get your butt back on over there and do what I'm tellin' ya. (relaxed guitar tones) (train horn) All aboard. (dial tone, beep) - [Voiceover] Hi Mandy, this is Dave Dietrich. Your prints are ready when you wanna come by and get them. - [Annie] Miss Post, I can't tell you who I am but this is important, you better come to Allerton. Your grandmother Post is real sick, she may be dying. Now don't tell anybody I called, just come okay? I hope you get this message. Come to Allerton, your grandmother Post is real sick. She may be dying, now don't tell anybody I called. Just come okay, I hope you get this message. (anxious piano tones) (doorbell ringing) - [Nick] Hello Miss Post. - Oh Lord, I'm in a hurry Nick. - Is that any way to treat your old man? - [Amanda] You're not my old man Doctor Cabrisi, not after the other night. - Look Mandy, let's just talk it out. - I don't have time Nick, I have to leave again right now. - Where to this time? - Where I'm going is none of your business. - Dammit, it is my business. - Look we are not together anymore, do you understand? - Is that all? - Nick. I'm going to Allerton, my grandmother's very ill. She may be dying, it's been 13 years since I've been there. 13 years, I left when my mother died. My grandma wrote from time to time and we talked on the phone occasionally. I always told myself she didn't really need me anymore. Now I guess she does. I could never bring myself to go back to that town and that house, that house of all seasons. (anxious guitar, flute music) (up tempo guitar, flute music) (eerie synthesized tones, flute music) (relaxed flute music, guitar tones) (phone ringing) - Hello? (relaxed flute music) - Mom, who called? - Wrong number honey, don't worry about it. Just go to sleep. Goodnight. - [Amanda] Goodnight. (anxious bass, piano tones) (anxious drumbeat, clacking) (elevated guitar, violin tones) (fast drumbeat, rising tone) (heavy bass tone) (low drumbeat, ominous guitar tones) (heavy bass tone) (screams) Mom, mom? (deep piano tones) (screams) (ominous bass tones) (tepid guitar, flute music) (deliberate bass tones, steady drumbeat) - Judge. (eerie synthesized guitar tones) - Hello? Is anybody here? (door slams) Hello? Grandma? Grandma, it's me grandma, Amanda. I'm here grandma. - Go away, stay away. - [Amanda] I can't here you grandma. - Away. - What are you doing, who are you? - I'm Mrs. Post's granddaughter, I've come to be with her. - Oh yes, Amanda. Rita Post's little girl come back. - Surprised? - Well we haven't seen you in such a long time. - Oh well, my home's in Dallas now. - Uh-huh, well I'm Doctor Crawther. - Oh yes I remember you. - Won't you come into the dining room? I've given her a sedative and she shouldn't be disturbed. - So who's been taking care of her? - We've had very competent help. - What's wrong with her? - Many things, she's very old you know. Your grandmother is a very independent lady. She wanted no one around to do things for her and consequently she was quite ill for many days before I was even aware of her serious condition. - Shouldn't she be in a hospital? - [Crawther] No, not necessarily. - This isn't the best place for a sick person. You have to admit that. - No I don't Miss Post, you're being presumptuous. Your grandmother was very attached to this old place. - What's that? (footsteps) Who else is in this house? - But that couldn't be Amanda, it couldn't be Amanda. - Yeah but if it is, that woman called her. Welcome come Miss Post. - Well I remember you, you're Mister-- - Judge, we call him that, I'll look in on Mrs. Harriet. - Well well, you've grown up Miss Post. - I can see that in your eyes, Judge. (chuckles) - I am delighted to see you again Miss Post. - Mister Kearn, it's been a long time. - I'd like to speak to you privately concerning some affairs that are very important to this town. - Claude. - This is none of your business Judge. - He wants you to give him this house. - That's not the truth, it's not for me, it's for posterity. You make it sound so mercenary. - It is mercenary, he's been hangin' around this house like a vulture ever since Mrs. Harriet took ill, trying to add to his collection. - That is a lie! - I came here to see my grandmother and I walked into, well it's just ridiculous. Doctor Crawther, I want my grandmother in a hospital. - That is not your decision to make, Miss Post. - [Amanda] Nor is it yours Judge. - It was your grandmother's decision and she decided-- - She can't even talk! She's in no condition to make that decision anymore. - You seem to be very suddenly concerned, Miss Post. It has been after all some 13 years. - You seem to be very strangely concerned, Judge. I want my grandmother admitted. - I'll do no such thing. - All right, I'll find someone who will. - Very well, if you should need me I'll be in my office. You'll find the list of Mrs. Harriet's medications on the table. - [Amanda] Now was there anything else? - You've made a mistake Miss Post. Doctor Crawther is very well thought of hereabouts. It will be difficult to find anyone to admit her. - That's the least of my problems. - And by the way, I'm fairly well thought of hereabouts too. - Yes I'm sure you are. - You stayin' here? - [Amanda] Why not? - Oh, it's just that a pretty little old thing like you all alone in this big, rambly old house? You never can tell but then you're a big girl now. You take care now, you hear? - Well? - I hope you'll come and see me at the museum soon. It's been a long time, we've grown. We are very proud of it. - I'll come soon Mister Kearn. - I hope you'll excuse. Come and see me soon. - Claude Kearn the curator. Grandma, grandma? (banging, rustling) (mysterious guitar tones) (strange rustling) You're still a spooky old house but you can't scare me! But you can't scare me, yoo whoo, yoo whoo. (echoes) Yoo whoo. (echo stops) Yoo whoo. (anxious guitar tones) Is anyone up here? (tepid flute music, guitar tones) (relaxed cello music) - [Voiceover] Good morning, Doctor Cabrisi's office. - Doctor Cabrisi please. - Doctor Cabrisi. - Nick, Mandy. - [Nick] Hello Miss Post. - Oh come Nick, listen I need your help. Grandma's really sick, I think she oughta be in a hospital. - Well where is she if she isn't? - Well she's here at the house, her doctor won't admit her. He says she's better off here. - Well he should know. - Nick, she needs to be in a hospital. - Good old Mandy, did you tell him that? (doorknob wobbles) Mandy, Mandy is something the matter? - No, will you come? - I'll be there tonight. - [Mandy] Okay, bye. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Voiceover] Hello Miss Post. - Hello, is that you Nick? I can't hear you, are you-- - [Voiceover] Welcome to Allerton. - Why thank you. - [Voiceover] We've missed you, I've missed you. - What? - [Unknown] Would you come closer to the phone Miss Post so I can hear you please? - Who is this? - [Unknown] I can almost feel your breath on my face. - Oh come on buster. I don't believe it, not in Allerton. (relaxed flute music) Oh mom. (screams) (high pitched tones) (ominous flute music, guitar tones) (water running) (anxious guitar tones) (phone ringing) All right! Hello? - I thought you'd never answer Miss Post. - Well I did. - [Unknown] I hope I didn't interrupt. - You didn't, now who is this? - An old friend. We could be very good friends Miss Post, why we could. - Bye now. (phone ringing) - Don't hang up on me again Miss Post. It makes me unhappy, I've been waiting too long for this. - Hey guess what? - Huh, what? - You're very sick. - I am not sick, don't you ridicule me. I won't allow it, others have ridiculed me. I did not like them either, Miss Post. You are breathing heavier Miss Post. Does that signify anything? - I'm freezing, what do you want? - I'd love to warm you. - Shove it, mister. (anxious guitar music) Boy oh boy, did you almost get it. Why didn't you knock or something, you scared me to death. - I did, no one answered. - [Amanda] Oh. - What's that for? - Oh I just got frightened, some silly phone call. - [Nick] Who was it? - Some jerk getting his jollies. - A breather? - Just your standard class-B obscene caller. How is she? - I haven't had time to examine her. You look pretty cute. - You just take care of your patient, huh? How's she doing? - Not so good. Mandy, how long has she been asleep? - About, my God, since I've been here. Noon, 12:30. - Well how many of these did you give her? - One at four like it says to. - [Nick] I don't understand, who is this Crawther guy? - Why? - I wanna talk to him, there's something wrong here. She must be getting something else. - My God. - Hey, hey, I want her admitted first thing in the morning. She'll be all right here for the night. Okay Miss Post, how about me? Do I stay here or at a motel? - Here. - Oh. - Sorry sir, it happens to be a single. - Well it beats $12.50 I guess. (anxious synthesized tones) (rising, warbling tones) - Nick? All right Nick, now what do you think-- - Shh. - All right, now what were you doing in my room? - [Nick] I haven't been in your room. - I'm not in the mood for funnies Nick, you came in. I know you did, I saw you go down the stairs. - Baby if I'd been in your room, I'd still be in there. You must've been dreaming. - Truth? - [Nick] Truth. Get some sleep, go on. (mumbling) She's mumbling something about a museum. That mean anything to do? - No I don't think so. - Get on the phone and get that ambulance here. - Museum. - May I ask who are you, sir? I'm Doctor Crawther, in charge of this case. - You were Doctor. - I see. - Don't you walk out on me doctor, I have some questions. - You're an impertinent young man. - Tell me doctor, why haven't you had her admitted? - Because she insisted. - [Nick] She can't even talk! - Doctor, I resent your implications. If you will take time to find out you will learn that Mrs. Post did not wish to be admitted to a hospital. She preferred to remain in her own home. She is an old, old lady much nearer death than you know and an old lady who prefers to die in the house she was born in. Now if you will excuse me. (relaxed flute music) (light piano notes) - Mister Kearn? Grandma. (relaxed synthesized guitar tones) - You kept your promise Miss Post. - Yes, I'm glad I did. - For you. - A bribe, Mister Kearn? - No, a tribute. - Look Mister Kearn, it's been over 13 years since I played here. - Ah, but we've grown. - Yes I can see that. - Aren't you curious? May I show you around, may I show you all the things that are so very precious to me? - My grandmother's things are very precious to me also. (relaxed guitar music) - It's wonderful to have you here. I have a surprise for you. I remember how you used to love surprises. This is very special, unique. You won't tell anyone about this? - If you don't want me to. - Promise, promise you won't. - Okay I promise, but I really have to go after this. Is that supposed to be my mother? Why did you do this? - You like it? - [Amanda] No I don't. It's sick! It's a bad joke, Mister Kearn. Now I want my grandmother's things out of here, upstairs and downstairs. I want our things put back where they belong. - I can't do that. - You better and you better fast. If you don't, we'll see what the Judge can do about it. - But I did it for you, for when you came back for you to remember her by. - The main thing I remember is a scared little girl with a dead mother. I don't need or want to remember anything else! (up tempo synthesized tones, drumbeat) (knocking) - What do you want? - I want to talk to you. - Well talk. - [Claude] Privately. - Hell, you were bound to get in here sooner or later. Come on in. - Why you've been keepin' secrets Judge. - Take a good look around Claude but don't get any ideas. This is mine. - It is beautiful. - What do you want, Claude? - I want to make a deal with you. I know what you and Crawther did to Miss Harriet and I won't say anything about it if you'll just make the girl leave the things in the museum. She's not to be trusted. She's just like-- - Just like her mother, Claude? Just like Rita, what was Rita like Claude? Now that Amanda is back to remind us all maybe we should talk about what happened to Rita, huh Claude? Maybe you know something the rest of us don't know. - No. - Maybe Crawther should give you something, Claude. - I'm no sick old lady, Judge. Crawther doesn't scare me. - Go on back to the museum and play with your mannequins Claude, I don't have time for your games. - The girl is going to take the things out of the museum. Stop her from doing it. Have I made you angry? I didn't mean to make you angry, I love her. I loved her when she was a little girl. I took good care of her. I taught her a lot. Don't let her go away. - Hello Miss Post. - [Amanda] Didn't you ever hear of knocking? - You're late, it's three-O-seven. - I was at the hospital. Look, I know this is a small town but do you always barge right in to someone else's house? - This isn't your house yet Miss Post. I'm Mrs. Harriet's attorney, by her parole I may enter this house any time I choose. - Boy, you sure have the gall. - What I have young lady are certain responsibilities. - To whom, according to Mister Kearn-- - Claude's a thief, I hope you see that Miss Post. I don't have time to waste. I have told you that I want this house. I would be willing to buy your interest in it, your potential interest Miss Post. I believe this to be more than a fair price. - I'll bet you do get everything you want. Well I'll tell you what, you don't get it. Kearn doesn't get it, nobody gets it. Not while I'm around, I'll burn it first! You're a dirty old man. You just give me the keys, get out and stay out. - You're in my way Miss Post. I'll be back tonight with the papers. I think you'll change your mind. - Not on your life, Judge. - Miss Post, perhaps you think me a rustic fool. I assure you I'm not. I can quote great literature. Here's one of my favorites from Lewis Carroll. The king's argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded. I'm partial to comedy. - Judge? Judge I'm here, where are you? - [Unknown] Ed, up here Ed. - What did you want to speak to me about at this hour? - [Unknown] Come up here. It's very important. - Judge, where are you? - [Unknown] Up here Ed. (anxious guitar tones, steady drumbeat) - Judge? Judge? Judge.? Where the hell are you? (rising fast drumbeat) (repeated bass tones) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Claude] Hello Miss Post. - Well hi George, how have you been? Long time no hear. - [Claude] I had to talk to you again. I've been thinking about you. I could see you undressing. I had visions of you with me. - George, shut up and listen. What is this huh, got a thing going? You charging admission? Why don't you come on over and tell me your funnies face-to face huh, anything wrong George? You're damn right there is, you know what it is? You're a miserable impotent freak. I'm not interested so buzz off. - You might be interested in your grandmother's life, Miss Post. - What's that? - You hold her life in your hands and you own, Miss Post. You still there? - Why, what do you want? - Everything that enters the house is mine. - This house has been in my family for many years. It's now my grandmother's, it would've been my mother's. - [Claude] Your mother was like all the rest. - What do you know about my mother? - [Claude] Shut up, I don't want to talk about her. - Well I do, what do you know about my mother? - [Claude] Nothing. - Do you know how she died? - She stole something from me. She was evil. She deserved to die. (gasping, heavy breathing) (scream) - Hello Miss Post, you don't know-- - What did you say? - Well I said hello Miss Post. Look I'm up, what's the matter? - [Amanda] I've got to get out of here. - There's no place to go in Allerton. How's your grandma? - [Amanda] What? - I said how's your grandma? - Why? - I'm just interested. Wasn't for me, you wouldn't have got those phone calls. - What? - My goodness, you don't look well at all. (phone ringing) You better answer that, it might be about your grandma. - I will, just don't hurt her please. - [Claude] Hello Miss Post. - I'm here. - [Claude] Now you're here you mean. - I-- - [Claude] Went out, I trust you didn't say anything. - No. How did you-- - I'm in your house. See how easily I'm sneaking up? - You need help. - [Claude] And you could help me. - Well I can try. - Why that's exactly what I had in mind, Miss Post. - Well good, we could-- - [Claude] You could help me, I have been waiting since you were 19 to hear you say that. Say you'll help me. Say it, go ahead say it. - I'll help you any way I can. - Oh that's just fine. Miss Post will help me. Make the sounds for me. you make when you are making love. The deep sounds all women make. - No, no I can't. - Now make the sound your mother made. - What are you trying to do to me? - I can't hear them. - No please, I can't. - [Claude] Miss Post, your mother was not cooperative either. I warned her. I don't want to hurt you that way. - You wouldn't. - [Claude] But I would. The sounds, now. - Look I would like to help you-- - The sounds now. I'm tired of this Miss Post, I want to hear them. - Please, who are you? - [Claude] Your mother knew. Miss Post-- - Okay, all right I'll do it. - Touch your body. Let me feel your hair on the phone. Are you doing that Miss Post? - [Amanda] Yes. - [Claude] I don't think you are. (tense tones) (unsteady breathing) (terrified moaning) (fast drumbeat) - Oh. Oh. (weeping) God. Very good. I think I'll call you Amanda now that we are so very much better acquainted. I think we should sleep now. Do you Amanda? Oh yes. I would appreciate it if you stayed in the house. Don't go out Amanda, no phone calls either. Do you understand? - [Amanda] Yes. - Goodnight Amanda. I will be talking with you again. (tense guitar tones) (anxious guitar, flute music) (gasping) - [Voiceover] County Hospital. - Doctor Cabrisi please, it's a emergency. - Doctor Cabrisi. - Nick he's been calling again, he threatened-- Mandy I don't have time now, your grandmother's worse. - But I'm scared Nick, he made me, he told me to-- - Honey, just lock the doors and go on to bed. He isn't going to go after you in person, they never do. - But he made all sorts of-- - Mandy listen, go to bed. He won't call again tonight and we'll sort this thing out in the morning, okay? Sleep tight baby, I'll get there as soon as I can. I've gotta run now, bye. - [Amanda] But Nick. Nick! (anxious piano tones) - Miss Post? (dong) (whispering, anxious tones) You're in my way. I want this house. I want this house. I want this house. - [Claude] We could be very good friends Miss Post. - [Judge] The sins of the mother. I want this house. (echoing) - [Claude] We could be very good friends Miss Post. - [Judge] Rita Post's little girl. - [Claude] But I did it for you. - [Judge] You're in my way. The sins of the mother. I want this house. - [Claude] But I did it for you. (echoing, voices repeating) - [Judge] Anything that had a head could be beheaded. - Nick? Nick. Oh thank God. (laughs) (anxious guitar tones) (screams) Nick Nick, Nick wake up, wake up. (screams) Operator, operator! - This is the operator. May I help you? Did you like my picture of Doctor Crawther? The knife, it's not there Amanda. Don't move away Amanda, stay there. You look so lovely in red. Oh pretty, so pretty. - You're sick. You're sick! - I'm not sick. Don't say that ever again. - You're sick! - Come back here Amanda, come back now. - You're sick! (glass shatters) * Give me a little kiss will ya hun * Give me a little kiss will ya hun * Give me a little kiss will you hun * (screams) - Young lady you almost killed me, do you realize that? - It's you, I should've known it was you. You're crazy, you're sick! (shouting) (phone ringing) It's not you. - [Judge] What's not me? - It's him, he's crazy. He's been threatening, he's in the house, I know he is. - Who's here? - I don't know, please help me. I don't know who he is. - Maybe I do, we'll see. Hello? - Why Amanda, your voice has changed. - Who am I talkin' to? - With whom am I speaking please? - Why don't you come on in the dining room and we'll settle this thing. - Well I don't think I want to do that Judge. Why don't you come up here all the way. - You better stay down here. - [Amanda] No please, I don't want to be alone. - It'll be safe down here, I'll take care of him. (anxious guitar tones) All right. I'm coming. Where are you? - Judge, Judge Stemple? Judge? (ominous violin music) (screams) - [Ensemble of Voices] Amanda, Amanda, Amanda! (screams) - Amanda, Mandy. - [Amanda] Get away from me, go away! - [Nick] Mandy. - Get away from me! Get away from me! - Mandy! Mandy, what have you done? For God's sake, what's happening? What's happened? (screams) (relaxed guitar, piano tones) (anxious flute music) (phone ringing) (low, ominous synthesized tones) - [Claude] And now shall we continue Miss Post? (tepid guitar music) (maniacal laughter) (tepid guitar music)
