Just like that. Rub them down good. Dad. Take a coffee break, Dad. Hey. Come and have some coffee. [men chattering] Man, that look of yours is making me nervous. How much is on your shopping cart this time? You sure you want to know? You might regret it. How could I refuse you? Pretty soon you'll be taking over our business. Let me help out, Dad. - Boss! - Your charcoals are burning too hot. Watch the backside... pay attention, we want the skin perfect. - Hog spit roast shouldn't just taste good. - Yes, sir. It should look scrumptious, too! It goes hand in hand! Got it, boss. What are you doing here? You don't belong here. You'll get toasted! Just keeping track of deliveries. If your mom finds out, she'll twist my ear. She made sure to starve mosquitoes when you were a baby. Don't you have a project to work on at home? Stay there! Are you sick of looking at me, Dad? You only get weekends off from school, you shouldn't be spending it here. It'll just tire you out. I don't want that. Go on, get out of here. Don't worry about me. I enjoy being around here. Maybe you don't want eyes on you. Your Dad is done with that life. Can I check out my cart now? - Give me some shopping money. - Let me see. Dad, come on! - Line them up. - Eloy! - Hey! - Reserve one for me for Saturday! It's my in-law's birthday. Oh, sure! You're really sucking up to her, huh? Nah, just trying to temper her. She's always on my case. I don't wanna get butchered. What do you need? Miss, how much for a spit roast? You know, she really loves Litsonera. What's your secret? It wouldn't be a secret if I told you! Keep your secrets! - I'll go ahead, Eloy! - Thanks! See you. Depends on the size of the roast, sir. We have small, medium, large ones. What about you, miss? How much for a spit roast? You jerk! How about I stick it up your ass? You son of a bitch, that's my daughter! - Sorry, sir! - I'd better not see your face around here! I'll chop your guts to pieces! - Sorry, sir! - Keep running, asshole! Limp dick! That prick. Nobody should talk to you like that. That's wrong. Never let anyone treat you that way. For sure you missed all these dishes. Can't find these in Dubai. You should have told me you were coming. I could have fetched you at the airport. And prepared your favorite dishes. Minerva... you're back all of a sudden. Something wrong with your employer? It's nothing. My contract's just ended. How long will you be taking a break? I'm not going back. I'd prefer to manage our business. That's what I've been telling you back then. You wouldn't listen to me. Honey! We're all set! Your mommy's not leaving anymore. Your wish has been granted. You'll always be with your mommy from now on. Come on, let's eat! We sold a lot today. Minerva... Can we… talk about it? I hope you'll give me another chance. Maybe we could work it out and remain as a family. Maybe we can start again. Eloy, let's talk properly. I'm really sorry. I promise it's not gonna happen again. I didn't mean to get that girl pregnant. Are you stupid? If you didn't mean to bury your dick balls deep into that whore, would she get pregnant? I'm a man and you were away for so long. You know I have needs. Needs? Our family has needs that's why I went away for work. If I didn't do that, we wouldn't have a business or a house. But while I was working my ass off, you were busy beating your cock. Forgive me just this once. For the sake of our kid. Come on, please, let's fix this. It's over, Eloy. I can no longer see myself as your wife. Besides, even if we have our own lives now, we can still be good parents to Elria. Right? It's over. You can leave the house. Come in here, all of you! Our register's missing eight thousand. Who took it? Come clean right now. Wait a minute, Minerva. These men have been with us for years. I trust them. - They won't steal from you. - Yes, ma'am! I counted these stacks so I'm sure. I stepped out for a bit and when I came back, some of it's missing. Ma'am, you're making a mistake. And who would come in here? A ghost? Now strip. Strip. Come on. Take off your shorts. Ma'am, we don't even go in there. Do it right now. I don't appreciate this. Don't take me for a fool. Look, a stack is missing. - Rod. - Go to her. Come here. Stand there. - Ma'am? - Take off your shorts. Why should I, ma'am? Take them off. Ma'am, whatever you're thinking, you're wrong! No, I want to see. Remove your shorts. Right now! I didn't do anything, ma'am. You thief. I got nothing! I got nothing, ma'am! I want to see. Take them off! - Go on, move there. Get out. - Hurry up! - Boss, please! - Just do it. Go on, take off your shorts. Minerva, forget it. What's this then? You thief! You dare steal from me? What is this, huh? Boss! Didn't I tell you to come to me... - when you need something? - I'll have you arrested! I'm just having an emergency, boss. I'm sorry! That's enough. Just rest for a few days, Rod. Go on. - Unbelievable. He's a thief! - Why did you do that? Look, he took the eight thousand. You don't have naughty hands, do you? - No, ma'am. - Are you sure? Two things I hate the most are thieves and liars. If you're one of those, just go home. You can trust me, ma'am. Did you bring your NBI clearance? Can't be hiring a wanted person. I'm clean, ma'am. Okay. I don't like idle workers here. Come back tomorrow. Thank you, ma'am. Good afternoon, sir. When you knock it against this stick, you'll know if the skin's crunchy or still tender. You should have a good feel for the heat. If the flames get too high, you should know how to temper it. Is that clear? That way, you don't burn your roast. Hey, honey. I'm off to school, Dad. My little girl's so pretty. - Here's your allowance. - Nice. - Thanks, Dad! - Take this, too. Take care. Don't get married yet. I need a boyfriend first. I'm off. - All right, be safe. - You too, Dad. Hey, isn't your skirt too short? Does your school allow that? This kid... where is this attitude coming from? Hey, kid. If you want to keep your job, learn to stay in your lane. Do you understand? Especially when it comes to my daughter. Are we clear? Thank you. Elria, hey! Elria! Hey! You're such a snob! Can you just leave me alone? Go home! Stop following me like a puppy. That's so mean. Let me drive you home. My motorcycle's over there. Oh, shit! Hey! Hi, babe. Who's this shitface? You. Are you hitting on my girl? Huh? Elria's your girlfriend? Didn't you hear what I said? I just said she is! What's his problem, huh? Boss, we were just walking. Just walking from school. Scram! - Elria, I'll go ahead. - Go away! He doesn't look too bad. And he's got rich boy smooth skin. - Not your type? - Him? He's just a playboy. Forget it. Anyway… if he bugs you again, just tell me. I hope you don't mind-- Looks like something's up with you and your mom. Probably because I'm not used to having her around. If she hadn't left, we wouldn't have a broken family. What happened? Sorry. I'm asking too many questions. You don't have to answer them. It's actually Dad's fault. But he's asked for forgiveness. Mom just won't let up. She's not ready to forgive him. Would you prefer if they got back together? I don't know. I guess. Nobody wants a broken family, right? Is that why you don't have a boyfriend? You're afraid you'll get hurt, too? Well, you could say that. I've tried it, though. It didn't work. What about you? What's your story? Nothing. My life's boring. Just tell me. I hate drama. Everything's fine! Or at least it used to be. Till Dad got sick. So there. I have to support my siblings. As the eldest. Well, aren't you a good boy? Your girlfriend's lucky to have you. You prick! Son of a bitch! Do you know this guy? You know him? Sit down. Sit down, Jonas. Have some food. Eat. Thanks, boss. Jonas, if you ever need anything, just tell me, okay? It's nothing, sir. It's not nothing. Just come to me. All right? Jonas, I appreciate it. Just be careful next time. Your place is crawling with dickheads. He's right. We're surrounded by hoodlums. Go on, eat. I should get back, sir. - Thanks. - Sure, take care. Anything. Anything, okay? Just tell me. Dad, I should get ready for school. Okay, honey. Be careful. I'll get going, too. Can we talk for a bit? I don't have to explain anything to you. I should go. Hey, honey! How's school? Are you tired? Come here, have a seat. You're just in time. I made pancit. I'm sure you're hungry. Here it is! Pancit! My baby's so pretty. You're so pretty like mom. I heard you don't have a boyfriend yet. Ugh, love-- Your love life, you know, that sort of thing can wait. It's good that you're focusing on your studies-- If you're worried I'll be a teenage mom, I won't. And if I ever get a baby, I'll make sure I'll never leave my child. Ah! Come in, mister! Delivery, ma'am. How much? - 1050 pesos. - Ah, 1050-- Bring it here, mister. - Right over there. Could you install it? - Yes, ma'am. Honey, could you get my wallet in my bag? Wait, mister. Please install it if you can. - Yes, ma'am. - Gas has gotten so expensive. The prices are shooting up. It's driving me crazy. Next time give me a discount! Everything's expensive, onion, garlic, all of them, even our electric and water... ...internet bills, the only thing not going up is basic salary, right, sir? That's true, ma'am. Elria? Where'd you go? That kid's taking too long to fetch my wallet. Oh, thank you. Go on, finish your food. - Thank you, mister. - Thank you, ma'am. All right. - Please close the door behind you. - Yes, ma'am. Go ahead, dear. Eat. I didn't know you arrived two weeks ago. But you showed up just the other day. Where were you? Ah... that's right. I stayed at my friend's house first. Because we were discussing some business plans. That's why I stayed there-- Nevermind that. You should eat. Don't worry about it. I just had to take care of some business. Just eat. Dad, can I sleep here tonight? But who's with your mom at the house? She's so annoying. She's asking so many questions. She just misses you, come on! Missed me? She arrived two weeks ago, but she only showed up just the other day. Are you sure? I saw her passport. She says she's taking care of business with a friend. If that's even true. Didn't your mom say she doesn't want to go back to Dubai anymore? That must be her backup plan. She'll leave again when she gets bored. I feel like she's hiding something from us. Whatever happens, she's still your mom. I'm the one causing troubles, aren't I? At least you didn't leave me for money. Dad, money doesn't matter to me. It's okay. It doesn't work that way, honey. You see, your mother left to make sure you'll have a comfortable life. See how she raised capital for our business. What am I? I'm practically just an employee. But at least we've secured your future. Right? You're overthinking! You're pretty but you're such a grouch! Go back to your quarters. Hurry up. Wow, you're making me feel like a paid escort. You just shoo me away after you're done with me. How much longer are you gonna keep me a secret? You know I still have a husband, right? Besides, this is the best setup for now. What's wrong with what we're doing? Are you ashamed of me because I'm younger than you? Give me a bit more time, okay? I'm tired of scampering like a rat in this place. Oh, it's late. I just have to pee. You're really something. Other girls wouldn't go near a piece of meat. You don't seem very fussy. I've been helping chop roast pork for Dad's customers ever since I was a kid. It's sort of our bonding time. Besides, I love watching him butcher a pig. Now that's really something. I've told you so much about myself. But you won't even tell me if you have a girlfriend. It's complicated. So you do? Come here. It doesn't look good. You being too close to our employees. Don't turn your back on me. I wasn't done talking. If your father failed to discipline you while I was gone, then those days are over. I'll break off your horns before they grow. What's your problem? I'm not doing anything wrong. Why would you suck on our employee's finger? You're a young lady. He cut himself with the knife. And if you're wondering if I like Jonas-- You're right, I do. Happy now? Guzzle her up, man. It's obvious she's into you. Your ass is dead, though. When boss finds out you're doing his daughter. If that chick was into me, I'd have ripped her in two. Right on. I'll go ahead. You like my daughter, don't you? Get it together. I knew it. So? Do you like my daughter? You should be asking her, not me. Holy shit. If you want to replace me with a teenage girl, pick anyone but my daughter. Come on, I can never do that to you, okay? I won't ever hurt you. You'd better not. I'm telling you. You'll regret it. I should be the only one, okay? That son of a bitch hit the jackpot! Our madame is a catch, that dude's a winner. Her ass is tight, am I right? Damn right. Here he comes. Someone went missing last night. I wonder where he went? Yeah. Acting all innocent, but he's a rabid dog! Exactly! What are you talking about? Are there rules about going out at night? We know what you're up to, Jonas. We know which hole you're squeezing into when you step out at night. Don’t deny it. Figures why you don't like the suckling. You're already laying with the mom! I'd also go with the one that fills both my tummy and pockets. - Right? - Makes sense. Whatever shit you think you know, shut up. It's not funny. You're lousy mates. You can't keep denying it, Jonas. Great moves, man. Real smart. You're putting your coconuts to good use... your body as well! - Think so? - Yeah, why? Got a problem? - Damn you! - Damn you, too! Think you're toughshit, asshole? Hey! Cut it out, buds. - Screw you, asshole! - Cut it out! Cut it out, man. - Hey! Hey! - Come here, tough shit! Hey! What's going on? Hey! That's enough! What's going on? What's the problem? What started this? Huh?! It's nothing, boss. Just a spat. About what? What's the problem? Why are you fighting? It's nothing, boss. I didn't know this prick was sensitive. I'm asking why. Who said what to whom? What's the reason? Forget it, boss. Just a stupid spat, boss. Sorry, boss. Sorry, man. We're cool. It was nothing, boss. Not a big deal. We're cool, man. All right. Get back to work! We shouldn't fight among ourselves! Sorry, boss. They saw me the other night with you. What the hell, Jonas? Why can't you be more careful? How should I know? Now that they know, can we stop hiding? I'm sick of sneaking around like this. I need more time. I don't want to give my daughter another reason to hate me. Why? Are we doing anything wrong? We're both single. Maybe you're just ashamed of me. I'm just worried Elria won't accept us when she finds out. She might stop talking to me. Or act out and ruin her life or something. What now? Ever thought that she might hate you more the longer you're lying to her? What happened earlier? These idiots got on each other's nerves. That prick just found a bullet and beat me to it. I'd have crushed that son of a bitch. You should have smashed his face. He thinks he's hotshit. Don't worry, bud. We won't talk. You saw how we kept our mouth shut in front of boss. How about you share your blessings? You really think you're getting a free pass? How about a round of drinks? You'd better not be stingy with us. You know... You're not getting jack shit. First of all, I'm not after Minerva's money. My intentions are pure. And she treats me well. Wow. "Pure." You should choose your words more carefully. Or you'll end up eating them. Rat me out to boss if you like. I'm not scared. Arrogant son of a bitch. - You arrogant asshole! - Prick. You pigs! Screw you! You're pigs! Honey? Jonas and I met in Dubai. His family used to live there. He was there for me when your father and I separated. Until it bloomed into a relationship. Jonas' father got deported. His whole family had no choice but to fly back to the Philippines. But we kept seeing each other. My coming home, he and I planned it. So we can officially be together. Jonas is different, honey. He loves me. I'm sorry, honey. I was just waiting for the right time. I admit, I was scared you'd pull away from me completely. Honey. I'm sorry. I just wanted you to get to know him a little bit better. You just don't care that we have a broken family. You don't wanna bother fixing what you have with Dad. Instead, you're sleeping around. Why are you turning the tables on me? It was your father's fault this happened to us. Your father and I have long separated before Jonas and I developed a relationship, I don't see anything wrong with it! Good morning! Good morning! It's my day-off. I cooked you breakfast. At least we can eat altogether sometimes. Elria's here, you, me... We're a complete family. - Ah-- - Eloy? There's something I want to tell you. Ah, yeah, no problem. Let's eat first, okay? Hang on, let me wake her up-- Honey? Honey? Hon? Hey. Come on out, let's eat. Let's eat breakfast.. Come on. Food's ready. Dad made you breakfast. Let's go. Come on, so we can all eat together. Like before, our whole family at the table. Is something wrong? Did you have a fight with your mom? Don't worry, we'll sort it out. Tell me and I'll sort it out. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Minerva… Her eyes look puffy. Did you fight? If you had a misunderstanding, maybe we can talk about it? Well... What's he doing here? Eloy, whatever you're thinking, you're right! What? What? You dumped me for this guy? This piece of shit? Huh? We started dating when I was in Dubai! He's half your age! He just wants your money! I'm in love with Minerva! Shut your mouth! I wasn't talking to you! You're in my house! I'm gonna kill you! We've been seeing each other ever since we were in Dubai, Eloy. I don't care! You sons of bitches! You can think what you want, Eloy. We're free to do what we want now. I'm not bound to you anymore. You know that! Is that why you were sobbing? Because of this piece of shit? Shit! Let go of me! Come on, keep it moving! It's high noon! You're as slow as turtles! We're behind on our deliveries! Ma'am, we can't just cut the roasting time. We'll end up with a bloody center. Don't stress yourself out. We can handle this. You're under new management. Am I right? Love, why don't you introduce your husband? That way, these shitbags don't try to mess with us. I'm sure you understood that perfectly clear. Jonas isn't a regular employee here. Show him some respect and follow his lead. Are we clear? Yes, madam. Don't worry, I got this. I can handle them. You can sit down. Dad? Dad. - Who is it? - Wake up, Dad. Come on. Come on, Dad. Watch out. Why were the bamboo delivered late? I needed them yesterday. And this pig still's got hair on it. What about this drainage-- When was the last time you cleaned it? Hey! Can you put your phone away? You're on the clock, right? I was just talking to my wife! Why? Is your wife paying your wages? Move it! Look, it's covered in moss. Disgusting. Come on. It's a simple job. Are you blind, you idiot? You've been doing that shit for years. You have such small brain for a huge body. What's your problem, asshole? Who do you think you are? Huh? Think you're something? Who do you think I am? Huh? Know your place. Tell that to yourself. Screw you! Just because you're banging the owner doesn't make you the big boss! Minerva gave me free rein to run this place. When you messed around, I filled in for you! Well, I'm here now! If you can't play nice, you should get the hell out! Can you stop, Eloy? Find out what happened first before you butt in. Jonas was just keeping your employees in line because you were too lax with them. Keeping them in line? Did you see how he was acting? He's worse than you! I can't work with a power-tripping scumbag! I can't deal with this kind of shit. So you'd better kick him out, Minerva! - Kick him out right now! - You're the one who should leave. Jonas stays here. You were just like him back then, weren't you? My father just hired you. Minerva. You're fighting with me? This place won't run without me! I built this place! My money built this place. If you think about it, you're just one of my employees. Your employee? Your money? Your money? It's my recipe that's bringing in customers, not your money! Anyone can roast a pig! Shut your mouth, asshole! You think I've taught you all the secrets, dumbass? You idiot. Dumbass. We'll see what happens to this place when I'm gone! You can't just throw him out like this. He can't leave this place. It was his decision, not mine. You okay? Get back to work! What are you looking at? Don't give me that look. Back to work! Get back to it! I can't bear being humiliated in front of your mom and that bastard! She talks as if her money is all that matters! I invested in this business, too! I invested my time... working endless hours to make things work. Does she think it's so easy? You know what? You know what, let her mess up! I'm sure she's gonna be pulling her hair out because of that bastard. She'll learn! What about me, Dad? Well, honey, if-- If it's okay with you, you can stay with me. It makes my blood boil just thinking of you under the same roof as that guy! No, Dad. I won't leave here. I'll stay and watch over the business. I won't let that scumbag ruin all your hardwork. Hon... That's not what's important to me. All I care about is what's best for you. I can take care of myself, Dad. I promise you, I will prove to mom that she made the wrong choice with that bastard. You don't have to do that. The truth will come out. And whatever happens, Minerva will always be your mother. Promise you'll take good care of yourself, Dad. You should look out for yourself, too. Be safe, all right? Yeah, go! Time to eat! Yeah, kill him! Give me a sec, love! We're almost done. Stop playing and come to the table. You haven't done any of the errands I asked. Almost there. Almost there. Hang on. Honey, let's eat. Let's have dinner. I made something special. My battery's dead again! What's for dinner? I made beef shank soup. Love. Yes? I was wondering if you would buy me a new phone? The battery drains quickly. Why don’t you save up for it? You're getting wages from our business, right? And you're not sharing with the bills either. You know all my money goes to my family, right? Right... You'll have to make do for now. We're really cash-strapped right now. Just charge it. Please, love. So you won't have a hard time contacting me. I can't. Not now, love. We have so many bills to pay. You know business isn't doing so good. There's not much people looking to buy our lechon. It's still working at least so just keep it charged. You can sit there. Don't we have utensils? Oh, right, I forgot. Here's your allowance, honey. What's wrong with your uniform? It's so short. Can't you dress properly, hon? And when you're in the shower cover yourself, won't you? You're all exposed. You're a young lady now. Why, mom? You scared of something? I'm just protecting you. You're still a girl and Jonas is a man. What are you scared of? He loves you, doesn't he? It must drive you crazy thinking he might prefer someone younger. Someone hotter, more alluring, and fresh. Stop trying to seduce Jonas, got it? And stop playing with fire! Or you'll burn yourself! I can put out the fire. Can you check how many sacks of charcoal we have left? So I know how many bags to order. Are you really gonna make me count sacks? Just make an estimate. Not like it spoils. I'm budgeting the money, remember? Prices of ingredients just keep going up. Then let's raise our prices, too. All prices are going up these days anyway. Besides, we can probably skip a few of the ingredients. That way we'll save more. You'll alter the recipe if you cheap out on the ingredients. The only thing that matters is that the roast is done well. That's what I'm here for. I'll handle it. I've got it all down. We can try. The customers might not notice. Hello? Is Eloy here? Ah, he's out on an errand. What can I do for you? I'd like to order lechon for Tuesday. I'll make a reservation. What size, sir? De leche, if possible. Not a hog, please. All right, no problem. I get it. Hogs don't taste as good as the sucklings. It's tough and it smells horrid. A younger one is more delicious. Actually, boss, it comes down to personal preference. Sometimes, older ones are much better. It all depends on how it's cooked. Too young and you lose out on all the nutrients. It takes away some of that flavor. Do what you want, whatever. As long as you have it ready by Tuesday! Yes, sir. It'll be ready for pickup by morning. Okay. Tuesday, okay? Jonas. Jonas! That hurts. Jonas! That hurts. What's the matter with you? What the hell? What's happening to you? You don't usually do that! I thought you wanted it? Why are you bitching now? What is happening to you? You didn't use to be like this. Don't roast any more sucklings-- Let's wait for these to sell first. Sure. Goddamnit, the day's almost over and we've only sold two. It's been like this for days. Relax, all businesses are like that. You'll have slow days, it's normal. Don't worry too much about it. Ah, sir, didn't you order from us some time ago? - Are you here to order again? - Ah, no. I'm here because my client from the event made a complaint about the food-- Yeah? I ordered from here as usual but the taste-- They say it didn't taste as good as before. Did you change your recipe? - Well-- - We just made it more savory. Doesn't seem like it. Your old recipe was much better. Ah, really? Ah, sir, maybe your taste buds are the problem, not our lechon. - Hey, stop. - Now, wait a minute. Who the hell is this? You should watch your mouth. I'm a customer here. - Ah, yes, sir-- - I'm a regular customer! Ah, ignore him, sir. I'm really sorry. Please, uh-- Hey, I'm not some servant you can yell at! I am the owner's husband. If you don't like our recipe, then don't order! - I said stop it! - You're not a loss! Screw you! - You're a nasty person! - I'm so sorry, sir-- So what? - Who do you think you are? - That's enough? Come on! Sir, I'm really sorry about this. I apologize. Eloy doesn't work here anymore. I'm the new owner, so-- Really sorry. No! You lost a customer because of this asshole! You son of a bitch. Get out of here if you can't afford it! - You bastard! - Go away! - Asshole! - Damn you, moron! - Cocksucker! - Come over here. You shouldn't talk to a customer like that. He was so smug! - Thinks he's hot shit. - We're gonna lose loyal customers! He didn't even order a lot! Well, we should probably bring back Eloy's recipe. What? Are you comparing me to your ex? Huh? If you still love him so much, then go be with him! I'm just thinking about what's good for the business. Don't be mad. Stupid bitch. Are you stupid? He acted like an idiot, and you're still coddling him? I don't have the energy for you, too. What's that bastard feeding you that's making you dumb? Or is he that good at eating you out? And it's turned your brain to mush? Learn to have some respect! Not my fault you're so stupid. Nasty little know-it-all. Hon, are you really not coming? Nah, I don't even know those people. They'll just gossip about us. Okay. I'll go now. You're always on that phone. Want one? Another bottle? No need. - Are you sure? - I'm good. You sure? I've got work tomorrow. I need to wake up or your mom might fire me. Don't you have school tomorrow? So you're a weak drinker. I'm good. Good night. Sorry. That's what you get for not knocking. You see things you shouldn't. Why do you have to go at it alone? When I'm right here. Why'd you come in, then? You know your mom's not here. You should go. She might walk in on us. I don't want her to think something's up. Screw you! You monster! - What are you crying about? - Pervert! You're the one who waltzed into the room. You'll rot in jail. Why, what do you think I am? Some teenage twat? I've always known what you were trying to do, Elria. You're the one who came in here. Let's see if anyone will believe that I raped you when this video comes out. You monster! You're a monster! Here, eat some. It's good. I cooked it. Smoked fish. Love, Mama messaged me. They've run out of money to buy medicine for Papa. Maybe you could give me some to send to them. Didn't we just make a deposit last week? That money was for their bills. Come on, love. If we don't, Papa might die. All right. How much do you need? That should be enough for now. Thanks, love. Eat some more. Have an egg. Hi, hon. Have something to eat. Join us. I really love your cooking, love. Good morning, honey! How are you? How have you been? Check it out. I put up my own shop. I borrowed from the money lender. Just a small-time business for now. Once I get plenty of orders, then we'll order by bunch and ask the next shop to roast them for us. Right? Then we'll look for a bigger place. What do you think? Nice, huh? Ah, honey. Sorry for these last few days. Your dad keeps running into a mess. But don't worry about me. Can't help it, I'm heartbroken. But your Dad needs to move forward. If he doesn't, who's gonna pay for his meds? Am I right? But hang in there. We'll get back up on our feet. Why are you so quiet? I'm fine! Dad? Yeah? I gotta go to school. Wait, do you have pocket money? Here, take this. You can keep it, Dad. It's yours. No, it's okay! Take it. It's okay. I'm going now, Dad. Scream if you like. Then I'll show everyone your video. I said shut the hell up! Do you think I'm an ATM? You press a button and money comes out? Wow, calm down. Do you think I'm taking advantage of you? Is it my fault my family's getting hit by one emergency after another? Yes, I understand, but we're not exactly doing well ourselves. Business has been so slow for weeks now. Of course business is gonna be slow. Your stupid ex is competing with us! I'm sure that's not what Eloy was trying to do. Spit roast is the only occupation he knows how to do. Why are you defending him? What do you want me to do? Tell him to stop? It's his right! Because he's helping me raise a daughter! Oh, wow, congrats. What a happy family! Christ, Jonas, you're being paranoid and a child right now. Instead of fighting, we could be thinking about how to make our business grow. Maybe we really are doing something wrong. Are you blaming me? Are you? Are you blaming me? Here I am helping you run it! Right? If you're gonna be like this, we should just split up! Yeah? I'll just look for a job. Then I wouldn't have to keep making things up to you! What's going on with you, Jonas? You've changed so much. Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Please, let's stop doing this. What are you saying? Didn't you start this game? - Please, I'm beg-- - Shush! Why are you tapping out? Come here. Be quiet! I said be quiet! I don't want to! You bitch, shut up. You think if you tell your mom, she'll take your side? Don't! You like that, huh? Screw you. What are you doing? - Love! Love! - You monster! - Love, it's not what you think! - You're a monster! - It's not what you think! - You shameless pig! Why does it have to be my daughter? I especially asked you not to! You animal! She seduced me! She seduced me! She just seduced me, love. It wasn't my idea. Doesn't matter what she did, you made your choice, too! Besides, you know what my husband did to me, don’t you? How could you do this to me? And with my daughter at that! You'll never believe what I say anyway! Because that whore is your daughter! But you're an idiot! Here! Look at this. Watch that and you'll know what I'm talking about. Watch it before you judge me! You cheater! And you! Do you really hate me that much that we had to get to this point? You shameless woman! Your own mother's husband! You want to fuck him? What kind of daughter are you? What's wrong with you? What, look at me! Look at me! You have no conscience. If you think I'm a pig, you're even worse! You're disgusting! I admit, I did seduce Jonas at first. To prove to you that he's a cheater. To avenge my father. That's why I made it look like he raped me. But he ended up raping me for real. I didn't know he took a video, Ma. I didn't know. He edited it. He threatened me. He said he would spread the video if I refused him. Ma, believe me, Ma. - I'm your child! - She's lying! She's a liar, Minerva. You already know your daughter has a crush on me. She wants to separate us. She asked me to leave you. She wants us to start living together. Love, I can't do that to you. I love you so much. Liar! I love you so much! I can never do that to you! I love you very much. Ma. Please believe me, Ma. I really love you. Let's get out of this place. Let's start over, shall we? Let's put this all behind. Go on, pack your things. Please, let's go. Let's get out of here. Come on, pack your things. Come on, let's start again. Let's go. I carried Elria in my womb for nine months. So even though we were separated for a long time, I've memorized her every heartbeat. I know when she's lying or not. So as her mother, it is my obligation to protect my child. Especially since I was the one who let a snake into our house. What are you saying? I love you. I can never cheat on you. I'll make sure you rot in jail! You bastard! Please, if I did something wrong, forgive me. It was one time. I love you. Please, don't do this! I can't forgive you! Please, I beg you. Let it slide this time. I will never forgive you! I'll have to kill you first. I could never cheat on you. I'll have to kill you first. What did you just say, bitch? Who are you going to kill? Stop moving! Go on, try to stop me! You talk big, you bitch. So? You think you can kill me? Alright, let's see who kills who first. Huh? What? Honey? What happened to you? Come here. What happened to you? It's okay...
