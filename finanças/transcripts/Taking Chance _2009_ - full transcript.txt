Blue one to blue two, checkpoint alpha bravo has been reached. Copy, leader one. Blue two, we have a suspicious vehicle on the right Moving pretty fast. Over. Army corps four, is he slowing down? Blue one, why are you driving so slow? You worried about getting a ticket? Over. Sorry, guys. Just rubbing one out. Phelps is down! Phelps is down! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Man: once we're quartered, we'll give you a rundown On battalion- And squadron-Level readiness And today's brief will focus on first marine division. The slide indicates that personnel readiness 1st mardiv Is not as bad as they are reporting. However, sir, as you are aware, last friday they made a request For 300 additional augments. Uh, given the insurgency in al-Anbar And the recent spike in casualties, It's not surprising that they made this request. Sir, it's my recommendation to just send enough augments To cover their casualties of last month. How many of you have been in iraq since 9/11? I know you've spent a lot of time on these reports, but i cannot have A bunch of analysts contradict the commanders on the ground. Man: i don't know. With all this administrative crap, It makes you wonder if we're losing focus on what really matters. Sometimes i wish i was over there. I don't know, sir. Be careful what you wish for, right? Hey, dad. - Hello, everybody. - Hi. Hi. Guess who came in first in her swim meet. Let me guess. You? High-Five. That's great! Hey, listen, guys, how about we get some homework done before dinner? - I think that sounds like a great idea. - Hup hup hup. What are you cooking here? White chicken chili with a balsamic reduction. Wow! - You're getting creative. - Oh, shut up. Mm. Let us pray. Ready. Down. - Ready, two... - Man: present arms! Forward march. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Hut. Bearers, halt. That is not nice. Dad, i think i got all of the words right, But i'm not sure. I'll throw a quick one at you right now. "Tortellini." T-O-R-I... I don't know. Sir, last night i read the d.O.D. Announcement about p.F.C. Phelps. He is from my home town, clifton, colorado. I don't know if this falls to us Or to the pentagon, but, sir, If the duty does fall to us, I would be honored to escort him home. It's a little unusual for an officer to escort a p.F.C. Yes, sir, i know that, But i would very much like to do it, sir. I'm going out of town for a few days. I'm being picked up at 6:00. - Tomorrow morning? - Yeah. I volunteered for escort duty. There was this private first class killed in iraq... young kid. He's from clifton. I volunteered to take him home. Wh-What is this about, mike? It's not about anything. He's from clifton, that's all.

Post up in dubois Is having a get-Together tonight in honor of chance. - You might want to come up for that. - Okay. Sounds good. Um... I'm glad you're here, sir. Yeah, me too. Your hotel is up in dubois, Where the ceremony's gonna be. You'll want to head out of here and get settled. - I'm sorry about all the driving, colonel. - Not a problem, gary. Okay, well, If i can get you to sign off on the paperwork, then we can call it a day. That sounds fine. I have some items The family would like to have inserted into the casket. They said they'd prefer not to view the remains, So i guess now would be a good time to do that. Yeah, that would be good, and, uh, i need to check on his uniform. Well, you know it's gonna be a closed-Casket funeral? I understand, but, uh, Just want to make sure he's squared away. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Look at that. He's got six ribbons. And he's a p.F.C., It's amazing. Yeah. The folks at dover did a great job. They knew he wasn't gonna be viewed And his uniform's perfect. I'm gonna... Take care of the paperwork. Mm-Hmm. If you're ready. Uh, yeah. Excuse me, sir. Are you the marine who brought chance home? Yes, sir. Mike strobl. - Semper fi, colonel. I'm charlie fitts. - Charlie. Listen, this whole town is grateful to you. It was my honor. Korea, huh? It's a privilege to meet An old first marine division warrior. There's some fellows here been waiting all night to meet you. Fellas, this is chance's escort, colonel strobl. - Larry hertzog. Welcome. - Larry. - Robert rouse. - How are you? - A.V. Scott. - Here we have gunny mulcahy, chance's recruiter. - Sir. - Gunny. - And sergeant michael arenz. - Sir. He was with chance when he died. Sergeant. Well, jenny, Let's get this man a cold beer. He's been on a long and lonely trip. - Did you know chance? - No. No, i didn't know him. - Well, you missed out. - Sure did. You know, a lot of recruits, myself included, Lose a big part of their personality when they go through boot camp. Sort of the point. But, chance, he comes back from boot camp, He sure as hell was a marine, but he was still chance. Same old wise-Ass smile. Arenz: he could get away with anything just by flashing that grin. Our first mortar attack in ramadi, Everybody's yelling, "grab your kevlars! Grab your flaks!" We were all scared, you know? Like, "welcome to iraq." Everybody's running, trying to get to the bunker. And phelps, he's got his shower shoes on, Grabs his rifle, runs outside, He's like, "where they at? Where they at?" Everybody's yelling, "phelps, get your ass back in here, man! Take cover!" He's still standing outside in his shower shoes. If you guys would excuse us, we need to head out. Yeah, we're building something special to take him up to the cemetery tomorrow. - Anything i can do? - I think you've done enough. - Colonel, good night. Thank you. - Good night. Arenz: the convoy's moving along, Doing a routine patrol south of baghdad, and... Chance wasn't even supposed to be there that day. It was his rest day. And knowing we were going out, He just had to come. Chance was up in the turret looking out for trouble. Charlie: that was his spot. Strobl: the most dangerous job a marine can have. Yeah, you're totally exposed up there. He loved it though. It always made me feel safe Seeing those shoes there. All over iraq, chance was just a big old pair of size-12 shoes looking out for us. Anyhow, we were driving along. Suddenly there's this huge boom. Out of nowhere, an i.E.D. Had gone off in the front of the convoy. So i jump out, check on the rest of the vehicles, and... It was madness, man. There was bullets flying everywhere. It was chaos, just total chaos, but... I could hear behind me chance's 240 opening up, Just unleashing an ungodly amount of fire on the mujahideen. So i thought, "okay, that part of the convoy's okay." He attracted all the fire to himself So that the rest of us could take cover, Get organized and get out. So after i checked on the first two vehicles, I run back towards our vehicle, and, uh, Uh, i could see chance was shooting all over the place. He was up in the air, everywhere. Just erratic, you know? And i yelled at him. I was like, "jesus, phelps, Don't shoot the birds, man." I thought he was trying to scare them or something. His finger was still on the trigger, shooting, But his head was slumped over. I got a little bit closer, i could see some blood Coming down the side of his head, and, uh... Inside the vehicle, doc checked his vitals, and, uh, He was gone. Six of us held him in our hands All the way back to the base. I just keep running it, you know, in my mind, like, "What could i have done better? What could i have done different?" What do you say to somebody's mom when they tell you, "It's not your fault. You couldn't have done anything." I owed it to him to save him. I'm the one who trained him. I just can't believe that i'm here and he's not. I'm glad you're here, sergeant. Thank you, sir. It means a lot coming from you. He'd be so honored knowing such a senior officer brought him home. - Sir. - Sergeant. Charlie: what that kid has to live with. I should've been over there, charlie. - It wasn't your time, colonel. - It was exactly my time. I knew the clock was ticking, Knew my time was coming up. But i just... I kept ignoring it, you know? Except for the middle of the night, when i Would check those casualty lists, just... Praying that i didn't recognize any of the names. I don't know, you know. I just, um... I just got used to seeing my wife and kids Every day, and, uh... So i put in a request for another office tour, And it was granted. They must've needed you here. No. My friends went. Guys i was in desert storm with went. I stayed home. I was trained to fight. If i'm not over there, what am i? Those guys, Guys like chance... They're marines. And you think you're not? Want to be with your family every night... You think you have to justify that? You'd better stop right there, sir. You've brought chance home. You're his witness now. Without a witness, They just disappear. You chance's escort? - Mike strobl. - John phelps, chance's dad. Sir. This is my wife chris, chance's step-Mom. - Welcome. - And chance's step-Dad jeff. - Colonel. - And this is chance's sister kelley, - And her fiance rob. - Hello, sir. I'm chance's mother. Thank you for your service. It's my honor, ma'am. I'm just so sorry for your loss. Please come and sit. A chair. - Thank you. - Come on, dear. First, i want you all to know That all along the way, Chance was treated with dignity And respect and honor. Uh, i have here a letter From chance's platoon commander. - Thank you. - Uh... I also have here Some of chance's things. It's still set on baghdad time. Here. This is the medal that grandma gave him. Remember? I want you to know you do not mourn alone today. All across america, From virginia to delaware, Pennsylvania, minnesota, Montana, wyoming, People are thinking of you And praying for you. You should know that Chance has touched many people. There's one more thing that i'd like you to have. A flight attendant in philadelphia handed this to me, And it seemed like it was very special to her. I was going to keep it as a reminder of the trip, But then i realized that She wasn't giving it to me. She was giving it to you. "April 9th, 2004... To the family of p.F.C. Chance phelps. Dear mr. And mrs. Phelps, I'm sure by now you have learned of chance's death. I don't have the words to tell you How sorry i am for your loss. Chance meant the world to me And to all of us here in the second platoon. I know parents aren't supposed to have favorites, But, trust me, platoon commanders do. Chance was a unique character. Where most marines would put in shows of false bravado, Chance would quietly attend to his business, And he liked to get people to underestimate him. His quick smile and friendly manner were always disarming and warming, But there was no mistaking... He was as fierce in battle as he was gentle in friendship..." Please be seated. We are here to honor the life Of private first class chance russell phelps. "...Please know that he died a hero, But more importantly, he lived a hero. It's ironic, but i am certain That if the world had more men like chance phelps... There wouldn't be a need for a marine corps." Fire! Ready, Aim, fire! Ready, aim, fire! From the president of the united states and commandant of the marine corps And a grateful nation, please accept this flag as a token Of your son's faithful service to his country. Semper fidelis. From the president of the united states, the commandant of the marine corps And a grateful nation, please accept this flag For your son's honorable and faithful service to his country. Semper fidelis. Thank you. Put your cell phones in the tray, please. Man: can i ask you to step up? Remove your shoes. Strobl: "chance phelps was wearing his st. Christopher medal When he was killed on good friday. Eight days later, I handed the medallion to his mother. I watched them carry him the final 15 yards. I felt that as long as he was still moving, He was somehow still alive. When they put him down in his grave, He'd stopped moving. I didn't know chance phelps before he died... But today i miss him." Hey, look who's home. C'mere. Group hug. How you guys doin'?
