And Moody Margaret, my number one enemy. Be honest, no, don't! - You were going too fast. - No, l wasn't. - You were way too slow. - l don't care! What's wrong with you? But l'm deputy head. This isn't some kind of game. This is a sophisticated club and it's my club and l can do what l like. l'm deputy head as l've already said. Shouldn't be just like... Aagh! Enemy attack! Na-na-na, na na na! Mission accomplished! l hate you, Henry! Henry! Homework, now! No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Oh, hi, l'm Henry, and this is my world. - Firstom, mydad. - Henry! He says the same thing to me every day. Get up those stairs right now and do your homework or there'll be no more television for a week. - Heard it before. - A month. - Oh, come on! - A year. No way! Then there's my wormy little brother, Peter, and his annoying cello. Hey, Peter. It's not bad... for a smelly nappy baby. And then Mum says: Don't be horrid, Henry! So then l got to my room and do my homework. Only joking. Why'd l want to do my homework? l'm way too busy. Wha-ha! Rocking out! Some day l'm gonna be a rock star. # Got no time for homework # Too busy being me # Singing Zero Zombies # Eating beans for tea # Down with wormy worms # That's what l decree # l'm the king around here # The all-time majesty # They say that l am horrid # But little do they know # l'm really, really horrid # And that's the way it goes # l'm a hero, l'm a pirate # Touching close with cool # A Tyrannosaurus Rex coming straight at you # Come on # Wanna croon it, croon it, croon it # l just wanna do it # l just wanna croon it # Too cool, too cool, for school # No no no no no # l'm nobody's fool # Too cool for school MUM: Henry!

Why am l not surprised, Henry? Oh, l've got a note, Miss. ''Dear Miss B. The cat ate Henry's homework again. Bad cat. Signed Henry's mum.'' Something tells me your mother did not write this note, Henry. What do you mean, Miss Battle-Axe? And something tells me you did not write this note, either, Henry. How do you spell homework? H-O-M-E... Ooh, that's very good, Henry. The next little bit might be a bit harder, seeing as you've never done any. How do you spell work? W ... ..E... R-K? No, no, no, no. W-O-R-K. That is how you spell work. And that's why l know you did not write this note, Henry. Because work is spelt correctly in this note and l know you'd never be able to spell it correctly. - Ah. - (knock on door) Enter! Boudicca, l just wanted to remind you the school inspectors will be here again today and we don't want any more... unpleasantness. Of course not, Miss Oddbod. (sigh of relie_ Thank you, Boudicca. Now... where was l? Oh, yes. Detention. (class gasps) Single detention for failing to do your homework. (gasps) Double detention for failing to bring in your homework. And triple detention for getting somebody else to write this note on your behalf about your homework. - But... - Silence! H-O-M-E W-O-R-K. Homework.

(thud) Miss Oddbod doesn't believe in rock stars. But l know the Zero Zombies can win the talent contest. Oh! Missed, bogey brain! Huh? - Hey, Margaret. Check this out. - Huh? Please! That'll never hit me. Ordinarily she'd be right. But l have a plan. lt's called Flick the Bogey. Carefully worked out with military precision, and resulting in a devastating airburst attack. (screams) Henry! l'll get you, Henry! Aagh! - (thump and splash) - Aagh! Mum! MUM: Homework, Henry. lt's just not fair, Fang. Homework should be climbing trees, building forts and playing with mates. This is my best mate. Fang. He can climb steep walls. He can walk on the ceiling like Spiderhamster. He can jump. He can exercise. He has bionic teeth. And...he can sing! (muffled singing) When l'm king, parents shall do all the homework. # When l'm king, yeah, when l'm king # The sun will come out and the birds will sing # When l'm king, yeah, when l'm king # The sun will come out and the birds will sing # When l'm king, yeah, when l'm king # l'll be able to do anything # When l'm king You're supposed to be doing your homework, Henry.

Erm...tie this tight. Ha! Try that for size, slug features. Yeah, slug features. (laughs) Henry. Yes, Miss Battle-Axe? - Teachers first. - Oh, of course, Miss Battle-Axe. (gasps) Allow me. (all gasp) (all laugh) He-e-e-e-enry! Oh, why is it always me? We simply cannot allow this sort of behaviour to continue. The inspectors have made it very clear that this school is under serious threat of closure. There's only one course of action. But, Cynthia... ..l'm the backbone ofthe school. - You cannot let this happen to me. - She can and she will. - Ooh. - l'll handle this myself, thank you. Boudicca... ..you and l have worked too long and too hard to see this school closed. The inspectors have commented on a total lack of discipline... There's no lack of discipline in my classroom. (shouting) ..out of control pupils... My pupils are certainly not out of control. (shouting) ..and a dismal homework record. (whispers): That horrid boy. l was never able to teach him anything. l've been told l have to make an example of somebody. So l'm afraid... (shouting) (sighs) You can go home now. What? You what, Miss Battle-Axe? You heard me, Margaret. You can all go home early. ALL: Yes! And following our exclusive report exclusively reporting on declining... - Hey, Mum. - You're home early, boys.

(sighs) l hear Ashton Primary School's closing down. Well, it does seem as though they're losing a lot ofteachers. Think about sending the boys to Brickhouse. But isn't Brickhouse very expensive? Well, yes. That's the whole point, really. But they do produce the most clever boys. # You're 2 cool 4 school (bone crunching) (squelching) # Wanna win some money # 2 cool 4 school # Be nobody's fool # 2 cool 4 school # Then maybe, just maybe # You're 2 cool 4 school 2 Cool 4 School! This is one of my most favourite TV shows ever. l watch it every week and nothing can stop me. Mummy, Henry insists on watching 2 Cool 4 School and l want to watch Business For Boys. l must have said please 52 million times and he won't budge. You see? Clever and charming. (baby retches) ln order to open a building society account... This is not fair. This is my house. l should be allowed to watch what l want on TV. When l'm king, l'll force stuck-up Steve... l am not stuck-up, l'm posh. ..to watch every single episode of 2 Cool 4 School three billion times! No-o-o-o-o-o! There's a try-out day coming up in Brickhouse. Why don't you take a look? We'll think about it, Ruby. l promise. l'm not going to that mouldy old Brickhouse. Ha!

Great Aunt Greta? She thinks l'm a girl. Yes, yes. Henrietta is fine. See? Well, yes, it does seem as though Ashton Primary School is in trouble. Oh. Oh. Right. OK. Goodbye, then. Bad news? No. Rather good news, actually. Great Aunt Greta heard about Ashton Primary, so she's booked Peter in for the Brickhouse try-out day. We can't afford to send the boys there. She says she'll pay for him to go. Oh. What about Henry? Great Aunt Greta has something else in mind for Henry to try out. No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! (snarls) So spirited, just like in my day. Go Giddiantus! - They're all girls! - That's right, dear. Lots of curls. l found this in my attic. It's yours now, Henrietta. Just what l always wanted. Om you go, Henrietta, and show them what you're made of. Agh! Eugh! It's a boy! Yuk. Shall we put it out of its misery?

We're always late and it's always your fault. But, sweetness... Don't you sweetness me. Just give me my stuff. Oh, sorry, my precious. At least there won't be any smelly boys... Oh, great! What's he doing...? (distant car horn tune) Well...bird brain. l asked you a question. Erm...my Great Aunt Greta thinks l'm a girl. That figures. Just don't expect me to sit next to you, toad breath. (whispered voices) - (door closes) - (gasps) Oh, my goodness. They know there's a boy here. What? What did you say? l can't hear you. l think they're after you. Run away! Huh? Miss Battle-Axe? Oh, Henry, you horrid boy. Margaret? Margaret? Margaret? Margaret? ls this your idea of a joke? Ssh. Don't even think about laughing. (gasps) GIRL: Why is there a boy? (whispered voices): Get the boy. (whispering): Get the boy! (farts) Quickly! Run! (girls shout) Yes, of course, school inspectors, l've got all your money. Must go now. Have to welcome new pupils from Ashton Primary. Welcome one, welcome all. OK, here we are. Right. Ready to go, then, Peter? Yes, Dad. It looks...very big, though. Don't worry. You'll be OK once you get in there. OK. Miss Lovely! Peter. What a lovely surprise. What are you doing here, Miss Lovely? l've come to see the headmaster. - About getting a job here? - Well, yes.

Er...Henry. You can let go of my hand now. Eugh! Things were getting really serious. lt was time for an emergency meeting of the Purple Hand Gang. Why have we got to save the school? What are we gonna do, Henry? lf our school closes down, we're all in trouble. l thought you'd be happy ifthe school closed. Normally l would be. Very happy. Exactly. Cos Ashton Primary's mega-horrible. l dunno. Miss Oddbod confiscates everything in sight. And Soggy Sid always makes you do 22 laps ofthe football pitch. - Yeah, he does. - When it's snowing. You're missing the point. The Demon Dinner lady confiscates our snacks. l know! So why do you wanna save it, then, Henry? Because... ..because... ..because...it's not Brickhouse or Our Lady Giddiantus. And that means, it's ours. Yeah, it's ours. lt may be all the things you said and way more, too, but it's our school and we can't let anyone take that away from us. He's right. Remember our school motto? Ad... (whispers) Ad solum esperanto. ALL: Ad solum esperanto! So how are we gonna save the school, Henry? Er... Oh, l dunno. You are such a dingbat, Henry. What's she doing here? To help you come up with a plan to save the school. l thought we were supposed to be coming up with a plan to get back into the talent contest, Henry. - (thunder rumbles) - Yeah, we were. Eureka! That's it! - That's what, Henry? - That's it! The talent contest. You know what? Here's what we're gonna do. We'll get back into the talent contest, we win it, and then we'll be famous! (all cheer) What? So famous that they can't close the school down? Well, it might just work. (all cheer) And no-one has to go to that Brickhouse. Or Our Lady Giddiantus. So we just have to win the talent contest? That's right. (tearfully): But you're not in the talent contest, Henry. You leave that bit to me, Lord High Majesty ofthe Purple Hand Gang. Yeah. Go Zero Zombies! (imitate guitar riffs) (chatter) - All clear, Brian. - Oh, good. Good luck, Brian. Thank you. Brian's in. Amazing. ln we go. That's it. Show your tickets. Sid? - Oh, no. - What's wrong? lt's Soggy Sid! What's he doing here? He's here to make sure the Zero Zombies don't get sneaked in. l can't believe you peanut brains didn't think ofthat. What we gonna do now? Do l have to think of everything? l dunno. - Hey! - (crunching bite) Oh, yeah, that's Vicious Vicky, Sour Susan's sister. - Sorry. Vicky does that sometimes. - She bit me. ln you go. - Where are they? - They're just coming. lfthey don't win... Ah, Margaret. Nice to see you supporting local talent.

So, Henry, you won the Ashton talent contest. - Yes, Miss Oddbod. - And you disobeyed my orders, running rings around Mr Soggington. Y-Yes, Miss Oddbod. Mr Soggington has now been removed from the school with a very sore bottom. - (giggles) - Uh. But none ofthat matters now, Henry. Do you know why? Yes, because we won the contest and we'll be so famous, the school won't close down. No, Henry. lt doesn't matter how famous you become, this school will still close down. But...l don't want the school to get...closed down. Well, you should have thought ofthat before you began all this... ..all this horridness. lt's too late now, Henry. Just get out. Yes, Miss Oddbod. l never thought l'd say this but... ..l am gonna miss Ashton Primary. (whispering) ''Purple Hand Gang Fort now. Signed friends.'' Huh? (purring) What's going on, worm? What's she doing here? Dark forces are at work, Henry. Peter has valuable information. We've got to act fast, Henry. There's no time to lose. Anyone have a clue what they're talking about? When l was at Brickhouse with Miss Lovely... What? Miss Lovely was at Brickhouse? Stay with it, beetle brain. It gets worse. - She discovered something terrible. - Terrible. And what was that terrible thing, Peter? They didn't polish their marbles or tidy up their tea cosies? l don't wanna know. l'm going back to my nice warm bed. Wait. Listen. Miss Lovely discovered that Vic Van Wrinkle... The evil headmaster of Brickhouse. ..is paying the school inspectors Iots of money to make sure Ashton Primary gets closed down. Why would they do that? So everyone will have to pay him lots of money for their kids to go to Brickhouse instead. Do l have to join up all the dots round here? How do you know all this? Miss Lovely wrote it down in her notebook. Look. Maybe we should tell a grown-up about this. No. Miss Lovely said we shouldn't. Listen. l have to get real evidence. Tell no-one, till l've found out more. What are we gonna do? l'll tell you what you're going to do, Henry. - Have a biscuit. - What? You're so weird. - Just open the tin, you mutant mango! - All right, all right. lt's for you, Henry. Yeah, l can see that. It's already been opened. Course it has. Otherwise how would l know what it says? ''The Terrible Teacher challenges you, Horrid Henry, to prove that you are 2 Cool 4 School.'' 2 Cool 4 School? But l didn't ask to be on 2 Cool 4 School. Well, you're going to be on 2 Cool 4 School tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - And you'll win the big cash prize. The big cash prize? ls there an echo in here? You're going to win the big cash prize, so you can give all the money to Miss Oddbod, so she can give all the money to the school inspectors, so they can say, thank you, and then they can go away - far, far away. But why would l do that? So Ashton Primary doesn't have to get closed down. Come on, Henry, keep up. Can't we get the money from somewhere else? - It's impossible to win 2 Cool 4 School. - Henry. We're from Ashton Primary School. We don't know the meaning ofthe word...impossible. Thanks, worm. And what will you two be doing while l'm offwinning 2 Cool 4 School? l'm going to Brickhouse to make sure Miss Lovely's all right. Oh, yeah. Miss Lovely. Almost forgot about her. Well, don't almost forget to win 2 Cool 4 School tomorrow, will you? (chanting): 2 Cool 4 School... No-o-o-o-o-o-o! # 2 Cool 4 School theme music DIRECTOR: Starting with camera one. # Oh, win some money # 2 Cool 4 School # You're nobody's fool # 2 Cool 4 School # And maybe, just maybe # You're 2 Cool 4 School # Wanna win some money # 2 Cool 4 School # You're nobody's fool # 2 Cool 4 School # Maybe, just maybe # You're 2 Cool 4 School (cheering) BOTH: Welcome to... ALL: 2 Cool 4 School! lf you're 2 Cool 4 School... You're... ALL: Nobody's fool! (cheering) Now, please put your hands together... ..for today's specially invited guest! l-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-it's... - ..Henry! - (cheering) (dramatic music) Tell me, how cool is...Henry? Oh, he's cool. 2 Cool 4 School. (thumping footsteps) Margaret, think Henry's gonna make it through? Ah. He'd better, otherwise he's going to be mashed up into tiny little pieces and fed to my piranha fish, OK? (gulps) Yes, brave words, there, from Henry's friends. And enemies. But he's gonna do it on his own now. How horrid do you think it's gonna be tonight, Henry? Very horrid. Can l go home now, please? BOTH: Aw! How sweet. He wants to go home. (laughter) Well, you can't! Not until he proves he's... ALL: 2 Cool 4 School! (cheering) Ooh, look at that. Our Henry on TV. - Who'd have thought it? - (baby retches) l still don't understand how this is going to save the school. Ssh! Don't worry, Mummy dearest. No-one ever wins on 2 Cool 4 School. Henry, any idea who this week's Terrible Teacher might be? - (sniffs) - Ooh. Well, we can give you a clue. lt's someone who knows you very well. (deep voice): Who knows your stre-e-e-engths. (timid voice): And weaknesses. MISS BATTLE-AXE: Henry has always had three problems. Homework, homework and homework. - That sounds like... - Your mission today... ..is to get your homework... ..in on time. - (audience gasps) - Homework... ..in...on time? - (school bell rings) - Right, Henry, let's play... ALL: 2 Cool 4 School! Hey... This way, kid. (muffled grunts) DIRECTOR: OK, guys, you're on in 3, 2, 1 . Ooh! Huh! Yeuh! (squelching) Ahhhh! Time for you to do your homework, Henry. lf you used the excuse, the cat ate your homework, 3,999 times in a week... ..how many times did you use the excuse that you lost it down the back ofthe sofa? Hm? Erm...but... that question doesn't make any sense. Precisely. (laughs wheezily) (laughter) We still need an answer, Henry. Too many? BOTH: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. lt's the right answer! (cheering) (gurgling and bubbling) - (burp) - Go get your homework, Henry. (laughter) (muffled) l think l can see it! l got it! (toots) Next question, Henry. Which one ofthese is not a nutritious snack? A bowl ofworms. AUDIENCE: Eugh! A bowl of spiders. (screams from audience) Or an Ashton Primary... hot...school...dinner? Stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew... ..stew. (all retch) Vegetable stew. AUDIENCE: Eugh! (all retch) You've got 30 seconds to get through the steaming stew pot, Henry. Starting now! Come on, Henry, you can do it. Henry can eat a vegetable, can't he, Vera-wera? - (baby retches) - Henry's never eaten a vegetable. (bubbling) (all retch) (baby retches) (splat) l can't do this. (panting) 25 seconds, Henry. (bubbling) (panting) (groans) 20 seconds, Henry! AUDIENCE: Eugh! Oh, that looks disgusting, Henry. F-fif-fifteen seconds, Henry. (sniffs) l could eat three bowlfuls, Henry. Ten seconds, Henry! Ooh! Aagh! (slurping) Fang! Five seconds, Henry. Four...three... You'd better hop out. Aaagh! (cheering) How did he do that? He did it. Henry did it. He actually ate...a vegetable. - Go, Henry! - (baby retches) Right, Henry. Complete this phrase. - Now you see it... - Now you don't. BOTH: Is the right answer! Which means it's time for... ..the Bog...of... ..Do-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-om! - Agh! - Agh! (cackles) And remember, Henry, there's only one way out ofthe Bog of Doom! Bye, Henry. Goodbye. Goodbye, Henry. (cackles) (door slams shut) (bubbling) Oh, it stinks! Yuk! Huh? ''Pull to exit.'' (owl hoots) (dog barks in distance) - (gasps) - There's Miss Lovely. (strains) (audience gasps) (strains) (audience gasps) Yes! Whoa! (audience gasps) (bicycle bell rings) - Huh? - (bell rings) (chuckles) Whoa! (manic laughter) (audience boos) (laughs) (owl hoots) (owl hoots) Hello, Peter. Come on in, boys. We've been waiting for you. (laughs) Whoa! (audience gasps) (quietly): Come on, Henry. (string snaps) (audience groans) (cheers) Oh, nice one, Henry. Yeah, nice one, Henry. Yeah. Told you no-one ever wins on this show. Loser-r-r-r-r! Whoa-ho-ah! What are you gonna do now, Henry? Henry! Try walking the magnetic moggy! Yes! Aagh! (cheering) (chuckles) What does that horrid boy think he's doing? That horrid boy is my big brother. And he's saving the school, if you really want to know. ls he now? How exactly is he going to do that? - Boy at the end? - He'll win the cash prize. - Next. - So he can give it to Miss Oddbod. So she can pay the school inspectors not to close our school. Oh. Hmm. What clever children you all are. But not nearly clever enough. Even ifthat horrid boy does win the cash prize, it will be too late. What do you mean, Mr Van Wrinkle? What l mean, my lovely Miss Lovely, is that even as we speak, Miss Oddbod is signing the papers that will close Ashton Primary forever. - (all gasp) - Oh, yes. (laughs) Forever. Forever. Forever. (laughter on TV) Would you kindly turn that racket down? Yes, Miss Oddbod. (both chuckle) So, Henry... ..one last homework question and you could be on your way to meet the Terrible Teacher and win the big cash pri_e! (cheering on TV) Where does Miss Oddbod keep the key to the Con_scation Cupboard? Oh, how l wish l could call Miss Oddbod to tell her that you're all OK. Quiet! Can't you see l'm trying to concentrate? The goldfish bowl. (both gasp) Oh-h-h-h-h-h! (imitates pump) BOTH: Is the right answer! (cheering) Go on, Henry. Open it. Yes, Henry, this is the Terrible Teacher's Confiscation Cupboard. See anything you like? Yeah. l like all of it. Cor, a Super Slimy Slammer. Oh, and the mightiest, Mighty Magnet! All ofthis...could be yours. lt could? All of it. But only if you give up the chance to go to the Terrible Teacher's Omice. OK. Hang on. What about the big cash prize? Oh. Oh, yes. You also have to give up the chance to win the big cash prize. Come on, boy. Let greed get the better of you. Have to hurry you, Henry. Don't do it, Henry. l'll give you all the pocket money in the world if you don't do it. l can't believe you just said that. No, l can't do it. (smattering of applause) Are you sure, Henry? Hmm? Yeah. l'm sure. (distant cheering) That boy is stupid as well as horrid. (laughs nervously) BOTH: Oh. Congratulations, Henry. The big cash prize is within your reach. And now... it's time for you to meet... BOTH: Terrible Teacher. Hello? (creaking) (door closes) Mr...er... Vic? Would you mind running through your fiendishly clever plan for us again? With pleasure. lt's all about greed at the end ofthe day. The school inspectors are greedy but l, Vic Van Wrinkle, am even more greedy. OFcourse it was my brilliant idea to set up Brickhouse School and then to close down all the other schools round here so that everyone would pay me Iots and lots of money to come here. (chuckles) HENRY ON TV: Hello? Hello? Oh, dear, l seem to have run out of ink. Would you get me some more? HENRY: Hello? You'll find it in the cupboard across the hall. Thank you. (ringing tone) Hello, Police? This is Ashton Primary School... Hello? Hello? Miss Battle-Axe, is that you? Yes, it is, Henry. You're the Terrible Teacher? You invited me on 2 Cool 4 School? Yes, indeed. And it's time you were taught a lesson. Yes, Miss Battle-Axe. (clasps click) Oh... Not so fast, Henry. Now, where's your homework? Oh... Here, Miss Battle-Axe. Well... ..it seems you have done your homework, Henry. Wait. There seems to be a subject missing. What's that, Miss Battle-Axe? Spelling. Spelling? Yes, Henry. Just one word. - ''Homework.'' - Homework? Yes. How do you spell ''homework'', Henry? Erm... Come on, Henry. H...O... (quietly): Come on, Henry. (quietly): l dunno. ..erm... l am waiting. ..M...E... All those spelling tests. All those weeks, months, years, trying to teach you something. All that work, Henry. Now how do you spell work? W...E... ..er...W... ..E.. W...O... ..O... Oh, Henry. Huh? Oh, Henry. Oh. Oh, Henry. Oh. W-O-R-K. Homework. H-O-M-E... ..W-O-R-K. That's how you spell homework, Miss Battle-Axe. Oh...well done, Henry! l knew you could do it! (wild cheering) He did it! (squeals) He won! Yes! Well, well. Not so horrid after all. (sirens blare) Looks like we've got company. Sorry l can't stay to say hello. Missing you already. Aagh! (screeching tyres) (chuckles) Oh, dear. Whatever happened? l tied his shoelaces together, Miss Lovely. You horrid boy! (laughter) (cheering) Yes, yes, yes. Oh, for goodness sake! Congratulations, Henry. You're only the second contestant ever to win 2 Cool 4 School. Second? l thought no-one had ever won 2 Cool 4 School? Well, somebody did, a long, long time ago. lt was you. You won 2 Cool 4 School a long, long time ago? Oh, wow. Come on, no time for a lovefest. We've got a school to save. Miss Battle-Axe. No, no, wait. Come back! Oh, no, don't worry. She's with me. Unfortunately. Hold up, snot face. l won that money, after all. Yeah, l bet we'll never hear the end of it. ''Look at me, l can spell homework.'' Big deal. Henry! You did it, Henry! You won 2 Cool 4 School! Don't get too excited, worm. Oh, shush. (police radios) Call yourselves school inspectors? The only thing you'll be inspecting is a prison cell! Oh, children. Does that mean Ashton Primary is not gonna get closed down? No. Happily for all of us, l think, it's not. Thanks to our lovely Miss Lovely. And your brave little brother, Peter. - Yeah. Super worm. - (sighs) Might l ask why you two are here? - Oh... - Well... They came to bring you this, Miss Oddbod. lt's the money Henry won on 2 Cool 4 School. We thought you could bribe the school inspectors to go away. Did you now? What a very kind and clever thought. - Thank you. - Thank you. But l don't need this money now so l'm going to give it back to you. lt's really yours. She gave it to me. Run along. l'll see you bright and early on Monday morning for another happy day at Ashton Primary. - Bye, Miss Oddbod. - Bye. - Thank you, Miss Oddbod. - See you on Monday. Hey, not so fast, slug snot. What we gonna do with that money? We, my beetle-brained friend, will have the party of a lifetime. Sounds cool. Deal. Turtle toad. Biscuit bonce. Slime bucket. Cockroach fart. - Henry? BOTH: Silence, worm! Grrrrrr! You horrid children.
