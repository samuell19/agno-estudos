(light upbeat music) - You're very strong for an 11 year, Nicholas. Soon you will be a man. - But bishop, my father says it takes more than strong muscles to be a man. - Especially for us Christians who must live under the rule of pagan Roman conquerors. It takes wisdom and-- - Look, look at all the fish we caught! - Nicholas, no! (water splashing) - As I was saying, to be a man, takes wisdom. At least enough to know better than to stand up in a boat. - I guess we lost all the fish. (yelling) Well, except this one! - [Bishop] The fish don't worry about losing the fish, Nicholas. As Jesus told Peter more than three centuries ago, Christians should be fishers of men. - How can we fish for people? - By attracting them to the true faith. We must give all of ourselves to our fellow man and we should do it not for thanks, but as Jesus did, because we have true love in our hearts. - Then, you must take this for your supper. (hay rustling) Oh father! He's beautiful! - I know how long you've waited for your own horse, Nicholas. And I haven't forgotten my promise. He's yours. - Whoa! Come on, boy. It's all right. (horse neighing) You'll like a bath, I do! (yells) (laughs) Except when I'm not expecting it. (horse neighing) Wait, come back! Stop! (Nicholas grunts) - Watch where you're going, Christian. Next time I just might keep your scrawny little beast. - Yes, Commander Marcus. (Nicholas grunts) - Sold for 10 pieces of silver. Now, here's a bargain for only eight pieces of silver. He may look frail, but he can still work and he won't eat much. (laughs) - He's selling people. - Draco, my friend, it looks like no one in Myra wants to buy that sickly little pile of skin and bones. - Let him go, let him go! - Ooh. It seems we have a buyer here. Well, well. How much do you bid? - Bid? - Well of course. This slave is for sale. Do you want to buy him or not? - Here. - What? Three pieces of silver. Come on. My friends, do I hear six? - I bid six pieces of silver! - Do I hear seven? Seven? Going to the gentlemen for six. - Wait! Take my horse. (crowd gasps) - Sold for three pieces of silver and a white colt. You just bought yourself a slave. Here's the key to his chains. (laughs) - I'll do whatever you say, master. - I'm not your master. I'm just Nicholas. Your friend. - Thank you, friend. Nicholas. My name is Adrian. - I knew you Christians believed in only one God but you fools buy slaves only to set them free? - Nicholas, as administrator of your father's estate, I must point out that in the 10 months since your parents died, you've squandered almost a quarter of your wealth, and on what? Beggars and orphans and-- - A quarter of my wealth? Is that all? I must try and to do better. - What? You want to give more of your inheritance to the riff raff of the world? - Nicholas, Nicholas! Commander Marcus, Draco and Woodcutter's daughters! - [Nicholas] Quickly, Adrian, show me! (woman panting) - You should be honored to be with Commander Marcus of the Legion of Rome. - When you borrow from Draco, Draco, always collects. Plus interest. - But you said I had until Friday to pay you back. - Well now, you have until tomorrow. Either you pay or your daughters shall be sold as slaves. (daughters gasps) - There there, old man. I'll see to it that your daughters never go on the block. - Oh, thank you, Commander Marcus. May all the Gods. - Because Draco has promised them to me. (laughs) - Until tomorrow, Woodcutter. - Help us, oh great Jupiter, ruler of all the Gods. Deliver my beloved daughters from the evil Draco and Marcus. - Adrian. - Sorry, Nicholas. (coins jingling) (Nicholas moaning) - So please hear my prayer, Jupiter. (girls gasp) Draco's men. (daughter gasps) Ah ha! - Wait! I'm your neighbor, Adrian! This is my friend, Nicholas. - Adrian? - Father, look! Someone dropped these down the chimney! - Enough gold to pay Draco with much leftover. You did this, but why? - Because you need it more than I do. - Thank you. May Jupiter look with favor upon you. - He didn't do it for Jupiter. (baby cries) (horse neighing) - All right, Woodcutter. It looks like your daughters belong to Commander Marcus now. - Never! Here is your money. (Commander Marcus gasps) - What? Where did you get it? (Adrian laughing) - You, you did this, you Christian. Mark my words. Someday, you'll pay for it. You and all your kind! (horse neighing) - [Man] And the day after he saved the Woodcutter's daughters, a widow with three small children and no money woke up to find 20 pieces of gold in her shoe. - Must've been Nicholas. When my cousin's horse died, he had no way to work his fields. Next day, he found another horse in his stable. He recognized it as one of Nicholas's. - I was so discouraged that I just wanted to lie down and die. Then Nicholas came and talked to me about the love of Jesus and the one God. - I was wondering what made you become so peaceful and happy. Just to be sure you never become a Christian. The Romans don't like them. - I know, but the Romans never really do anything about it. (intense music) - What? But let's Caesar Galerius, the Christians grow in number each day. They continue to ignore our gods and poison people's minds with talk of Jesus and one God. - Yes, Commander Marcus. Unfortunately, my appeals to Rome have been given little acknowledgement, but be patient. I promise you that someday I will put an end to Christianity. (money clinks) - Nicholas, what are you doing? - I thought no one was here. (gold clanking) - But Nicholas, you've already given so much. This is all you have left. - I know the church will put it to good use. - Bless you, Nicholas. You give totally of yourself, as Jesus did. Wait. I am an old man. My life is almost over. Soon, someone must take my place. - No one could ever replace you, Bishop. - There is one. I have written to the other bishops and they agree. When I am gone, you Nicholas, will be appointed Bishop. - But I'm not a priest. I'm not even a man yet. - As thanks for baptizing me and my daughters, I have brought you a gift which I've been working on for a long time. - Bless you. From this day forward, baby Jesus will be the patron of this cathedral. - Nicholas. I want to become a Christian too. Will you baptize me? - Of course, Adrian. But are you sure? - Yes. Ever since I can remember, I loved hearing you talk about Jesus and I've learned what it means to be a Christian. - Then why did you wait all these years? - I guess I needed a little time to think about it. (Nicholas laughs) - Bishop Nicholas! Please tell us more about baby Jesus. - Yeah! Did he give me presents for his birthday? - Well, yes he did. He got a few lambs, some chickens and other things. - Did baby Jesus like them? - He loved them. But then he discovered very special secret. - A secret? Please tell us! - It's called sharing and giving. He found out that sharing with others for the love of God made Jesus very, very happy. - [Caesar] I have good news, Commander Marcus. After all these years, Emperor Diocletian has finally given me the authority to solve the problem of the Christians. - And my orders, Caesar Galerius? - To do whatever is necessary to crush them. (horse neighing) (pots shattering) - Let no Christian escape! - Are you a Christian? (crowd yelling) (horses neighing) - Thank you. - (laughs) You'll thank me by fetching a good price on the auction block. - That way. Quickly! (horse neighing) (chariot thuds) - Nicholas, come back! - Help me, help me! Don't touch me, Christian. Over here, they're getting away! (crowd yelling) - Your efforts have not been all that successful, Commander Marcus. You crush one Christian, and 10 others rise to take his place. - What else would you have me do, Caesar? - Burn their churches. Arrest their leaders! (crowd yelling) - We must save the baby Jesus. - No, Adrian! The roof is going to fall! - Your cathedral makes a fine fire, Christian. And you'll make a fine prisoner. I arrest you in the name of the Roman Empire. - Please. Adrian is! - Take him away. (rain trickling) All right, Christian! Deny your Jesus. - Never. - You'll die here. (water splashes) (door creaks) (sad music) (bird chirping) (light music) (door creaks) In the name of Constantine, new emperor of the Roman empire, all Christians are to be set free, immediately. Release the prisoner. By decree of the military tribunal, You Commander Marcus, shall hereby be stripped of your rank and shall spend the rest of your life in this prison for crimes against citizens. - Here, take this. - You. You're still a fool. Nobody cares about this Jesus of yours anymore. - Even if it's true that I am the only Christian left, I will always love you. (light music) (crowd singing in foreign language) - (gasps) Nicholas, at last! Welcome, dear friend. How I prayed for your return. It's me, Adrian. - Adrian. - It's Bishop Nicholas! God has returned him to us. - The cathedral! Who did this? - We all did, Nicholas. But especially you. By your sacrifice and the memory of your generosity and faith. Come. - It is a truly splendid cathedral, Adrian. And baby Jesus! - Yes. I was able to carry it out the back door, just before the roof collapsed. - I have much to be thankful for. - And so do the rest of us, Nicholas. We look forward to you saying Christmas mass for us tomorrow. - Welcome home, Nicholas. It's me Draco, the former slave merchant. - He's one of us now. - For many years, I saw Christians willing to die rather than renounce their God. No one would do that unless it was the true faith. - Only yesterday, he brought all this. - [Draco] I give them freely to repay in some small way all the misery I caused. - Bless you Draco. (light upbeat music) (children gasp) (singing in foreign language) - [Narrator] The expression of generosity shown by Nicholas on this Christmas Eve, like so many times during his life, was remembered and handed down through the centuries from generation to generation, from country to country. And so every Christmas, the spirit of giving celebrates the infinite generosity of God who became a small child to bring us the greatest gift of all, the hope and joy of salvation. (upbeat music)
