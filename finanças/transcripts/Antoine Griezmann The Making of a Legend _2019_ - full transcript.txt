As a kid it was my dream to be a pro, to train every morning, to make a living from football. That was my dream. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY Nothing happens by chance. -There's Grizou! -Hey! -He struck! -Hey! -He scored! -Hey! Grizou! Grizou! Griezmann with the ball. Oh, my God! What a player! It's easy to find a great player on the pitch. Ball to Griezmann... Goal! If someone's a friend or a brother off the pitch, you fight for him on it. Grizou's L! He's always a steady and decisive player. That's how he's reached the top level. Barça has Messi, Real has Cristiano and Atlético has Griezmann. What a beauty! For a kid who's eaten shit... Hats off. MAY 23, 2018 CLAIREFONTAINE, FRANCE START OF PREPARATIONS FOR 2018 WORLD CUP It's not so much what people are saying. We were more focused on our game, on how we were going to play. Yes! Leo Messi's on the penalty spot. There. France, France! We all just want the competition to start, the World Cup to start, because our preparation was lengthy. I tell you, a month shut up together in Clairefontaine and everything! The weight room's pretty serious. You have to really concentrate. You can easily hurt yourself if you mess around. How many? But we needed to have a bit of a laugh too. When there's a goal, you celebrate. If someone's a friend or a brother off the pitch, you fight for him on it. My connection with Grizou on and off the pitch is strong. JUNE 10, 2018 - THE BLUES LEAVE FRANCE FOR RUSSIA JUNE 1998 - ANTOINE AT 7 YEARS OLD I was already number 7. It was all planned. Fabien! Fabien! I could approach them. My father helped me do it. I was with a very good friend, JB. We went to see them and slipped through the security barriers. -Lizerazu... -Barthez. Barthez... -Thierry! -Nice! The future generation! From the age of five he had a ball in his hands all the time. You can't say that a child's going to be a pro but at all the pro clubs he tried, he got rejected. You have a meeting with the coach at the end of the session. He says you'll get a letter in two weeks. You wait two, three weeks, four. Then you warn your son that it's not looking good. It's got nothing to do with football, it's about running fast and being 5' 9" tall. Those criteria... It was very difficult for Antoine, a little short-ass who wasn't very fast. It must have hurt him too when they said I was too small. There were times he didn't want to go and I pushed him into taking me. I took him to Metz and Montpellier. I took him to all the camps in France. I went to a lot of trouble. Hours and hours in the car, spending time together, always happy going out, and sad coming back. It was hard being told no every time. "We'll follow his progress" meant "no" at that time. JUNE 16, 2018 - KAZAN, RUSSIA FRANCE'S 1ST WORLD CUP MATCH AGAINST AUSTRALIA Before making any decisions, I talk to him to find out how he feels, to discuss things, so that I have the information I need on how he feels. It's as if he's giving me the keys to the house so I always try to listen. He's won everything so you have to listen to him. If you see things differently you talk to him and say, "No, I see it like this." FRANCE VS. AUSTRALIA 58TH MINUTE The most important place for him to be is on the pitch. He's a leader when it comes to attacking and technique. 70TH MINUTE We didn't play well against Australia-- a bit angry, a bit disappointed. We were a bit disorganized. We weren't a team. Everyone was doing their own thing. JUNE 21, 2018 - EKATERINBURG, RUSSIA FRANCE VS. PERU 2ND GROUP MATCH He arrived tired, worn out. He'd finished the season late, played a lot. He was psychologically and physically worn out. Okay, okay. I shook him a few times because I know him well. He always needs a bit... a bit of needling to get him going, but he listens. If there are things which seem to me... ...to be wrong, I tell him, for his own good. He's analytical. What's important is the way he reacts. He always reacts positively. But he can't always be in top form. Sometimes things get difficult. FRANCE BEATS PERU 1-0 TO REACH THE LAST 16 LAST CHANCE TRYOUT MAY 2005 FRANCE - ST-GERMAIN-EN-LAYE ANTOINE GRIEZMANN AT 14 Walking past a pitch, we saw this team-- Montpellier, in fact, who'd just taken this kid in. I saw immediately that he wasn't from the club. It was a tryout. He had on different socks from theirs. He was small and blond. You couldn't miss him. He was unusual. When he had the ball and some space, he had potential, but it was difficult. He often ended up on the ground because he wasn't athletic enough. His technical ability was the sort that can't be taught. It's innate, it's acquired, it's talent. You see it today in the ease and fluidity. In short, it was talent and it was already there. I tried talking to him. It was a bit... He was in the stands. I sat next to him. I went into the stands with a packet of biscuits. He came up beside me and said he'd swap biscuits with me. I gave him one of mine and told him to keep his. It was a first encounter which made me think, "Well, let's dig a little deeper." The tournament finished. We all lined up for our prizes. He came and gave me his card. I wanted to discuss it with the father, not the kid. His dad didn't believe it. They were away on holiday. MÂCON, FRANCE - ANTOINE'S BIRTHPLACE We came back from Croatia. Antoine had put a note on the fridge. "We would like your son to play in a tournament at Real Sociedad. We'll cover everything. Please phone me." With a phone number. I didn't phone. THE GRIEZMANNS' FORMER HOME They were a close family who hated seeing their kid, who was so passionate, keep getting rejected, always on the same pretext. I was quite disappointed by certain clubs. "Too small, too frail." I thought, "They use the same criteria as the French Football Federation, and we're not traveling almost 600 miles for nothing." So I said no. It was for a tryout so I thought, "One more." My parents weren't keen at first. He nagged me so much all week that I phoned Eric Ohlats. It was a Saturday. He said he'd be in Mâcon on Monday. I said, "Do as you wish. If you're in Mâcon, I'll see you." And he was in Mâcon on Monday. So I went, but it wasn't a done deal. I tried to say what I really felt in my heart and my gut. I said, "Let him try out and we'll see." He said, "Not another tryout." But I told him the philosophy was different. I explained the Spanish way and told him that if he wasn't taken on, it wouldn't have anything to do with his athleticism. Knowing that all the clubs here had rejected him, I gave my guarded support but my wife was against it. Of course, Antoine was all smiles just to be getting through the door. So off we went, with no guarantees. THE UPROOTING You're leaving France, leaving your brother and sister, your parents, your old life, your friends, the Mâcon football club, going to another country. On the bus, they'll speak Basque or Spanish. He was only 14. It was difficult on the bus. I sat on my own, listening to music. I couldn't talk to anyone. I had to put him in a dormitory. Knowing the lad, I thought, "It's never going to work. In two weeks he'll leave. He'll hitch a ride home. He won't stay." So I thought, "He can stay with me for three months." But time passed and he stayed until he was 18 or 19. Real Sociedad paid for three trips a season-- Christmas, the summer holidays, and February, I think, or something like that. Apart from that, we only saw Antoine every two or three months. It was hard. For family birthdays I was never there. It was pretty hard. I didn't phone. They'd have known from my voice that I was sad, crying, so I avoided calls. I did leave messages. My wife could never come with us. Going to the airport, Antoine would be in the back, crying. It was upsetting to see him doubled over, crying. I'd say, "Antoine, you're a free agent. Let's go home." "No, Dad, I'll do it. I'll show them." And on we went. It lasted two or three years, until he was 16. He found it hard being back here. He'd cry for two days. He didn't play much. He didn't have football to support him, to help him feel okay. It was hard. His parents came to a tournament. It didn't go well. He didn't play at all. I had a chat with his father who said, "This is impossible. If he's not going to be a pro, he might as well go home." But without a hint of aggression. I said, "No, don't do this. Let him stay another year." ONE YEAR LATER The next tournament I wondered, "Would he do it or not?" It was a moment of madness, but... I got him up at midnight. I was in bed. He took me to a nearby wall. There was no light on the wall or on the ground, so he got his van and turned on the headlights. He started showing me what to do. He smacked the balls against the wall and I had to either intercept or pass. It was "balls against the wall" with me telling him, "In the game you have to move early. Before the ball hits the wall, you need to move and ask for it. Once you've got it, with your skill, you'll keep it." When we finished, the van battery was dead. He had to phone a friend who sorted it out and helped us get home. He had a fabulous tournament. He was player of the tournament, top goal scorer. He was offered a contract. TAKEOFF - ANTOINE GRIEZMANN TURNS PRO WITH REAL SOCIEDAD ANTOINE GRIEZMANN AT 18 Carlos Bueno was the attacker, about to become a first-team player. He took me under his wing, started to advise me. I started watching his movements, his calls. I tried to copy him. He saw I was keen to learn, to improve. That's when everything changed. MAY 2010 - REAL SOCIEDAD JOIN SPANISH PREMIER LEAGUE Griezmann aims for the far post. He scores! What a goal by Griezmann! Goal by Real Sociedad. We saw he had the technique, speed and intelligence for the game. What I didn't know about was his physical endurance. He always finished on top in tests. He crosses it over. Let's see if he can finish it off. What a goal! Griezmann with the header! He gets into the car to drive to victory. Great pass by Xabi Prieto. Griezmann shoots. What a goal! He can play everywhere. He's good everywhere. For a coach he's like a Swiss Army knife. Griezmann! Goal by number 7. Goal by the French player Antoine Griezmann. Great cross by Xabi Prieto. He's looking for Ifrán. He finds the ball and he shoots! What a goal! AUGUST 2013 - REAL SOCIEDAD QUALIFIES FOR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE HISTORY IN THE MAKING 28 JUNE 2017 - ISTRA, RUSSIA THE BLUES' BASE CAMP We knew we had to win seven matches. That was nothing compared to the Champions League or the Spanish Liga, or so we thought. "Hell, seven matches to be world champions. We've got to give it our all." He loves his job. He loves football. That's why he gives so much. He's always smiling, good-humored. He's good with everybody, whether they're older or younger. He's very sociable. BLOTTING THE COPYBOOK 13 OCTOBER 2012 GRIEZMANN JOINS FRENCH TEAM HOPEFULS AT LE HAVRE WITH FOUR TEAMMATES HE SNEAKS OUT TO PARTY IN PARIS I stained my character, my family name. I thought I was bigger and better than the others, I thought I could do pretty much anything I wanted. THEY PAID THE PRICE A 13-MONTH SUSPENSION FROM NATIONAL SELECTIONS I met up with him back at San Sebastian. His dad wasn't happy. He's a bit like me-- impulsive. He said what he had to say. He deserved to hear a thing or two. He listened and said nothing. And then it was simply a case of, "Do you want to redeem the situation? Do you want to get your cap and your career back? That will only happen on the pitch." When you're young, you do daft things. But he learns from his mistakes. He really applied himself at his club, thinking, "I may be suspended for a year but I'm going to work hard so that I'm ready in case I'm selected again." He thought he'd lost everything. He worked extra hard. I felt it really matured him. There are certain... It was a minor mistake, not a major one. Everything else was put on hold to concentrate fully on getting back what he'd nearly lost. JUNE 30, 2018 - KAZAN, RUSSIA FRANCE VS. ARGENTINA - LAST 16 FRENCH DRESSING ROOM I don't know... Put Paul there, and Oliv' behind him. Hey, brother, with us three... Right, I'll tell them. I'm someone who considers the group and the good of the team. I discuss tactics. There are things and situations that we try to improve on. I help them with their placement and give them tips... to run less but still be well placed. We play the same way at Atlético so I'm better able to help. A silent dressing room where you see players who normally play around doing that a bit less than usual! It was Argentina. We had to play a big match to beat them. 13TH MINUTE We're up 1-0 and they equalize. Then at the start of the second half they score a second goal. It's tough. We needed to counter-attack and that's what we did. When Blaise passed deep to me, the defender was ready, but I reckoned I could do it. Ben's strike gave us a bit extra. Celebrating with the substitutes gave us a boost. FRANCE THROUGH TO THE QUARTERFINAL We were really on top. We were full of confidence, sure it was ours. It all fell into place. BACK TO THE HOTEL THE SCHOOL OF RIGOR SINCE JULY 2014 GRIEZMANN HAS PLAYED FOR ATLÉTICO MADRID Up! Down! Here we go! Go on, go on! Everyone likes him here. Barça has Messi, Real has Cristiano and Atlético has Antoine Griezmann. Antoine Griezmann! He was a player who'd earned his place alongside Messi and Cristiano. For me he's in the top five in the world. Griezmann is looking dangerous. Griezmann is coming through the center. Wow, what a great play! The ball to Griezmann. Goal! The genius Antoine Griezmann appears. Goal by Antoine Griezmann! Gabi to Griezmann. Griezmann slips it through for Atlético Madrid. What a goal! When I first arrived at Atlético, it was very complicated. It was a different mentality and the intensity of training was different. I thought, "Wow! I'm going to have to work hard and try to emulate my teammates to get as close to them as possible." Good. Perfect! The first months were hard. He had to adapt to our style of play. The intensity demanded by El Cholo was not at all what he was used to. I remember a session where I received a ball and instead of shooting, I passed. He stopped the training session and blew the whistle. If he only speaks to you, it isn't good. He said, "There are no passes here. You've got to score, to strike." "Football is about winning and winning means goals, so..." He shouted at me but it taught me a lesson. I went home a bit angry and down. El Cholo had him playing in midfield, not glued to the touch line like at Real, a bit closer to the goal. And that change made him better. El Cholo and my club teammates gave me... let's say, my love of making an effort for the others, even the goalie. If there's a pass back to the goalie, I love going for it. There, like that! At Atlético Madrid with Diego Simeone he has this gift of caring for the group. Even to excess sometimes, and I've told him that. He can go to the top but he likes to hang back too and take part in building the game. He can make a lot of critical passes and he's at home in front of the goal. He enjoys scoring and attacking but also defending. FOR THE 2015/2016 SEASON HE IS NAMED BEST LIGA PLAYER Griezmann with a 180-degree turn. Koke heads to the right. Filipe Luís bursts through. Ball back to Griezmann... Goal! At Atlético Madrid, he's the star, the ace, the model player. This new status is thanks to the club and Diego Simeone. He sees in Antoine his creature, his creation, his Frankenstein. He was a good player at Real Sociedad, but in Madrid he became a world-class player. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 2015-2016 QUARTERFINAL ATLÉTICO MADRID VS. BARCELONA SEMIFINAL ATLÉTICO MADRID VS. BAYERN MUNICH CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL ATLÉTICO MADRID VS. REAL MADRID After his first big defeat he phoned me. After the Champions League final, he was disappointed. We talked for a day. It's rare for Antoine to vent like that about a loss. He thought if only he had scored... It didn't sit well. It's hard to get to the final of a competition. We lost the Champions League final in 2016. Antoine lost the Euro final. Two years later, football offers you revenge. I'd had two defeats in two finals so the third time I was going to win. I wanted it. I'd have done anything to win it, to take away the sadness of the two lost finals. For the Europa League I was confident. I was calm before the match. I scored twice. ATLÉTICO MADRID WINS EUROPA LEAGUE 2018 MADRID, SPAIN FOUR DAYS LATER IN FRONT OF HIS HOME CROWD ATLÉTICO MADRID VS. EIBAR LAST MATCH OF THE SEASON What was happening? We had just won the Europa League and they were booing the player who won them the final by scoring twice! FANS BOO HIM FOR NEGOTIATING CONTRACT WITH FC BARCELONA It went very badly. I didn't say anything. People were commenting everywhere. It did serious damage to my morale. For my parents, too, because they were there. It was difficult for Antoine. I knew he'd decided to stay here. He was happy to have made the decision to stay at Atlético Madrid. And then that happens. The first thing that came into my head was to calm the crowd by telling them, "Don't boo him, encourage him. Antoine is happy here. He feels at home." I love that club. I love my teammates. I love the coach. They showed me a lot of affection. It's incredible to see how much the coach wanted me to stay. My teammates too. The club made a real effort to get me to stay. It was touching and now I'm happy to be here. Look, my brother's the handsomest! We've always had a great feeling and our relationship has kept growing. The passion he has for Uruguay comes from deep within him. He'd always had Uruguayan people or players close to him. At Real Sociedad with Carlos Bueno, Martin Lasarte, who was his trainer. He likes our way of being, our culture, how we speak, how we are. It's the customs. Drinking maté... I gradually learned to appreciate it because of Carlos Bueno. The first time I hated it but I wanted to try it again to see if my tastes had changed. It started like that. I'll have a maté. Give me some, please. JULY 6, 2018 NIZHNY NOVGOROD, RUSSIA FRANCE VS. URUGUAY QUARTERFINAL We all knew it was a key match for him and he took full responsibility for the free kicks, the penalties... He took them perfectly. 40TH MINUTE On the pitch we could see that he was motivated. He wanted it. Playing against my teammates and my good friend, Godin, was hard emotionally. I'm his daughter's godfather. That says it all as to the friendship between us. 61ST MINUTE It was thanks to those balls that move a lot. The goalie tried to send it out and it moved at the last minute and went in. People asked why he didn't celebrate the goal that took him to the semifinal of the World Cup. People didn't understand. He said it was out of respect for the Uruguayans. The president even officially invited him to Uruguay. Joy inside, but also a lot of respect for my teammates, for that country. I didn't want to celebrate. It wasn't planned, it's just how I felt. I was proud to be there. I can say, "That's my friend, someone who respects us." FRANCE BEATS URUGUAY 2-0 We're in the semifinals We're in the semifinals We're in the semifinals We're in the semifinals -2-0! -Hey! -There's Grizou! -Hey! -He struck! -Hey! -He scored! -Hey! FRANCE DISCOVERS ANTOINE JULY 4, 2014 - RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL WORLD CUP QUARTERFINAL FRANCE ELIMINATED BY GERMANY, 1-0 There was this little blond kid, very young, baby-faced, crying. French crowds are very emotional. They love tears. He broke down like a kid. He has a kid's soul. I think the French crowds really like that. Who knew Griezmann? Nobody! Unlike Mbappé, he hadn't suddenly been declared the future superstar of French football. He arrived calm and humble, and he's earned his stripes. We had a French team with individualistic players-- bling-bling, big mouths, dodgy dealings. The French team in 2010 was nothing. Nobody believed in it. Sponsors were leaving. The French had lost interest in the French team. A player like him was needed to spark a renewal. The kid was crying because we'd lost, the way French people cry. The French people were beginning to be won over again. They thought, "Maybe we can believe in this French team." Even if the French team, the Federation and Deschamps backed Griezmann to be the ambassador who would recreate that emotional link that had been lost by the 2007-2010 team, you can't just press a button to make the public love Griezmann. But Griezmann has what it takes. Griezmann has the best passes, the most positive image, the smile. When he scores, his childlike joy is infectious. When he celebrates, he celebrates with the fans. He's reconnected the French team with the fans. EURO 2016 IN FRANCE Euro 2016 comes at a key moment. It's a key moment for France. The French aren't expecting this team, and there's this player who's not a poser, who has a physique like any other Frenchman, and who plays without holding back until he becomes the top scorer of this Euro. 2ND GROUP MATCH FRANCE VS. ALBANIA On the bench at the Euro we were side by side and he went on and scored. That's when Grizou became the best player of the Euro. QUARTERFINAL FRANCE VS. ICELAND SEMIFINAL FRANCE VS. GERMANY FRANCE LOSES TO PORTUGAL 1-0 It was tough for us because we didn't win, but we showed that we were determined to come back. MADRID, SPAIN Power isn't given, it's taken. So he took the lead in PR and advertising. Within two years he'd gone viral. He became bankable for all brands. They wanted him, his image, in their ads. -Hey, am I sad? -No, that's too much. Look mysterious. One, two... Okay, let's go. One, two... Other way. Good, good. There were other bigger offers-- too big, which would have got in the way of the demands of top-level play and the need for rest time. It's all very nice but he took all that into consideration, too, to give himself all he needed to be the best he could be. He's a competitor. He knows what he wants and he does what's needed to get it. FRENCH TEAM DRESSING ROOM No one got bigheaded. Everyone was working towards the same objective. The coach was big on that. He knew how to handle the difficult times and the happy times. Don't give an inch. Don't give an inch. And don't drop anything. Every ball... It's a strong group. That's so important in the dressing room and on the pitch. We had great times in Russia. It's a great group. He's always dancing, he's relaxed, he likes music. He's very content. During warm-ups right up until the match starts he's concentrating 100 percent on it. You can see. JULY 10, 2018 ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA FRANCE VS. BELGIUM SEMIFINAL They said, "Don't cry. There's another match to play!" MÂCON CELEBRATES FRANCE'S WIN That's when I knew we'd be world champions. There was one match to go, but I thought, "It's okay, it's mine." In the Europa League final I scored twice and had a great match. I had the confidence of having played a final like that so I thought, "It's mine." Grizou! Grizou! It really was the perfect match. It was a team that's hell to play. We didn't have any big chances and then we had that corner kick. 51ST MINUTE You didn't half celebrate! After that we closed in on them, we regrouped. It was very hard to win or to create big chances in that match. "WE LOST TO A TEAM WITH NO REAL GAME." If it came from the other team, I'm pleased. It's what I want, for our game to get to them, nobody able to find a solution. We played seven matches like that and nobody beat us. We have to just keep it up. For the president! He's here! We carry on. We represent France so I'm proud to wear this shirt, to be French. We don't say that enough. FREEDOM We all wear the French team shirt. It doesn't matter where we're from. We're French and we're proud of it. That's what I felt. I wanted the whole country behind us, all 23 team members and the staff. We need that, everyone being for the team, giving maximum encouragement. MADRID, SPAIN ANTOINE GRIEZMANN'S HOME I'm seldom home now that we're in the Championship and the Champions League. I'm so tired from all the effort, all the plane journeys. It's the only place I really relax, where I'm content, at rest. If they're due at the match, if they're not at the warm-up I worry that something has happened to them. When Erika's with Mia she picks her up like that. Even if I'm not saying much. Sometimes when my sister arrives, if I'm watching basketball on TV, I don't talk because I don't know what to say or I don't have much to talk about. But I always try to make sure she and my brother are all right. Even if I'm not talking, I always try to pay attention to them with small gestures. JUNE 2012 - ON HOLIDAY IN NEW YORK There's not much of an age gap. He mostly tended to protect me a lot. He did that when we were small. All the time. NOVEMBER 13, 2015 - ATTACKS IN PARIS FRANCE VS. GERMANY During the match Patrice Evra heard the first explosion. A few minutes later there was a second one. It could have been a smoke bomb. The crowd and the players didn't know what was happening outside. The first bloody attack in Paris took place at the Stade de France. Due to an incident outside the stadium, would all supporters leave... The players went back to the dressing room. They were deliberately not told to avoid panic in the stadium. Despite that, Antoine Griezmann had a feeling that perhaps his sister Maud was near the Bataclan. I went into the lounge and asked what kind of concert it was. They said it was a rock concert, I said, "She was there." They tried to phone me umpteen times. We had to wait and pray. When I got out, I phoned my mother and told her I'd got out. Antoine apparently breathed a huge sigh of relief. My friend who was there told me he was white as a sheet. She told us about it but we can't imagine what it was like. Since then we've tried to stick together, to be with her, but she's had some bad times. NOVEMBER 13, 2016 - BATACLAN COMMEMORATION My parents and I went to the moment of silence at the Bataclan. My brother wasn't there. He was with the French team. He sent me a text that morning which said, "It's not an anniversary that I want to mark. Life goes on. You know I love you. We need to move on, move forward." That's all he said to me. I thought, "That's just like Antoine." Welcome, my friends. ISTRA, RUSSIA FRENCH TEAM'S QUARTERS This is my secret place. Even Mbappé can't come in! I've been sleeping. I just woke up so it's a bit messy. Sorry about that. Two days before the final eight or nine players got together. We talked about everything-- football, our lives, our dreams, the final. There was just one more match to play. In 90 minutes' time we'd be world champions and go down in history. One match... I'm telling you, one match and that's it! All of France would love us. We'd be an example to youngsters, to players in training. I think that pushed us on even more. The more opportunities you get to play in finals, the better your grasp of the context and the preparation. You lose less energy. You're more insulated from outside influences. It's hard to lose finals matches the way he had done before. You learn, but it comes with experience. JULY 15, 2018 - MOSCOW, RUSSIA FRANCE VS. CROATIA FINAL I just avoided looking at the cup. I had looked at it in the Euro and the Champions League and I'd lost those matches. So in the Europa League I intentionally didn't look. It worked. You don't change what works. And I tried not to cry during the anthem because it was an amazing moment that I might only experience once. And then, I don't know-- I can't remember the action because it ended so well. With the first kick, you have so much adrenaline, your legs work on their own. You make a quick pass. The ball flies because of your adrenaline. So you have to work it off quickly. 38TH MINUTE PENALTY FOR FRANCE I was telling the referee to get the goalie on his line. I didn't want him distracting me by coming up to me and saying things. It looks as if I'm saying, "I'll shoot over there," but no, I'm saying, "Go where you belong." I took the ball and I thought, "It's in the bag." Easy, eh? No, but right then I was... very confident. I knew that it was my moment and that it was important so I was relaxed and calm. The whole world watched. Everybody watched that penalty. He didn't shake as he took the ball. He had incredible confidence. As the players celebrated the goal, we were thinking, "That's it." We've got it. We've got to defend hard, make a team effort, and we'll get them on a counter-attack. 59TH MINUTE I love the penalty area, seeing where my teammates are. I knew Paul had the legs to get near me. I tried to control the ball, I tried to make it so he just had to strike. Then we thought, "That's it. There's no comeback now." THE FINAL MINUTES IN FRANCE MOSCOW, RUSSIA We're world champions! We were ecstatic. It was incredible. You're world champion! Oh, my Grizou! I thought of my parents. Sorry. My parents who let me go at so young an age. The coaches, or parents of my teammates when I was 14 who told my dad he was mad to let me go so far away like that. My mother... When things got hard I remembered taking baths. I'd be in the bath and she'd come in so we could chat without talking about football. With Dad it was all about football but Mom and I talked about how I was, how I was doing at school, even if it wasn't great. How I was doing at school, how my private life was going. My brother and sister, I see them rarely, so it was like, "Hell, we made it." We made it, and there's nothing better, I think. BEST PLAYER IN THE FINAL For a kid nobody wanted, who's eaten shit for... Hats off. Twenty years ago we won a tournament in Mâcon. I don't recall which one. And now, the World Cup. Look! There's Antoine with his daughter. Mia, my baby, she was crying because the crowd frightened her. I didn't want to take her on the pitch. It was raining. She was going to get wet but my wife insisted. The cup was extra shiny because it was wet. The rain, as some of the players pointed out, was falling on everybody who wanted to see us lose. We were enjoying our thing. -Can you take a photo? -All three of us! -Should we kiss it? -A little kiss! Take your hat off! It's true, at that final he was on top. He did us so much good. We took the cup home as well! JULY 16, 2018 CHAMPS ELYSEES, FRANCE I don't think we were expecting so much. Lovely! I didn't have my phone with me. I was enjoying the moment. The people waving flags or wearing team shirts. The planes going over with the French colors. We were ecstatic. It was incredible.

SEPTEMBER 9,2018 STADE DE FRANCE CELEBRATING THE TITLE OF WORLD CHAMPION Me too, my Grizou. I'm proud of you. He's up there, but I know him. He's done a lot but he's got a lot more to do.

I think you only realize you're at the top of your career when you're in the streets in France and you see the cockerel with its two stars. Otherwise it's hard to acknowledge it.
