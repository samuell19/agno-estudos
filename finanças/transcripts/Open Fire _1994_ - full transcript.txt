[THEME MUSIC] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] You want to send me to the boneyard-- you should try yourself. I'm gonna break you, Kruger. Better hurry. [THEME MUSIC] KRUGER (ON RADIO): Good afternoon, my friends. As you listen to this tape, remember that this is our big score. We do this right, and we will all retire. Each one of you will have the opportunity to use your special skills. As usual, everything has been carefully planned. Do not be concerned about the escape route. I have a little surprise in mind. Good luck. I know you won't let me down. Soon, we will be back together. WORKER 1: Oh, way to go, kid. We can't work without power! WORKER 2: (LAUGHING) Yeah. Nice job, Bonehead. -Come on, we ain't got all day. -Yeah. What's your problem? WORKER 1: Hey, McNeil, you gonna hold his hand? (LAUGHING) The fuel pump on these units is a little touchy. Try it now. [POWER STARTING] Thanks. If this guy knows so much, what's he doing here? Hey. Do you wanna try mine? I don't think so. DEACON: Kesack, what are you gonna do? Shave your legs with that thing? Or yours. Hey. My money's on her. [LAUGHTER] [SIREN] [SIGH] License and registration, please. What seems to be the problem, Officer? You've got a break light out. Aw, geez, you know, I'm really sorry. My regular truck's back gettin' fixed. All right. I'm gonna let you go with a warning this time. But make sure your company takes care of the problem. Oh. Yes, sir. Thank you. I'm on my way back in there right now. -Take it slow. -Be safe. (TO HIMSELF) This road doesn't go to Long Beach. (SHOUTING) Hold it! Thanks for the warning. He should have worn a vest. [LAUGHTER] Another day, another dollar. [PHONE RINGING] Martinson. Bob McNeil, please. Alec? ALEC (ON PHONE): Lynne? Hey. How's it going? It's fine. Hang on a second. I'll get your dad. Don't be a stranger, OK? -Yeah. OK. Thanks. Pressure seems good on number four. LYNNE (ON RADIO SYSTEM): Bob McNeil? Bob McNeil, phone call. It's Alec. Hey. ALEC (ON PHONE): The trout at Lake Cachuma are jumping in the boats. Is that right? Sounds great. I could use a little time on a lake. These double shifts are killing me. You say the word, Pop. Listen, Goes tell you what. You're on. Saturday, 5:30. I'll meet you at the lake. I'll fly the Cessna up. Oh, by the way, Alec, I just heard a management position opened up at our corporate office. Now, listen, if you're interested, I'll, uh, talk to Bill Fuller about it. No, forget it. We went through this before. BOB (ON PHONE): Yeah, well, sooner or later, you're gonna have to put this thing behind you, son. Come on, Alec. Loosen up. Yeah. Uh, I'll see you at the lake on Saturday, Pop. I'm looking forward to it. Bye, Son. [ALARM RINGING] Number two? Mm-hmm. I've got nothing. BOB: Thing's overheating again. We'll take care of it. Tell Lynn to meet me there. LYNNE: Bob, the pressure's rising, and I can't seem to stop it. Argh! [INAUDIBLE] the thermal switch! -OK! Come on, baby, come on. Come on! BOB: Good. It's coming down. -Ooh. That was just a little too close. I'm sorry. I was having a bite. I thought you said the flow regulator on this unit was taken care of! Repair signed off on it this morning! Another five degrees, and poof! All right. Get repair back up here now. -I-- Just do it. Sure thing, Mr. McNeil. -6:14! -All right! 6:14! All right. Right on schedule. You can't deliver here. Oh, I can, today. [GUNSHOT] KESACK: Your shift's over. Let's go. Come on! [INAUDIBLE] Hold it! Back up! Now! Communication secured. KESACK: I said, move it! Go to the right. I said, move! PETE: Hey! [GUNSHOTS] WOOD: I'll check in here! NAKATA: Make sure it's welded tight. Someone just shot Pete. Come on. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): 911 Emergency. Yeah, hi. This is Martinson Indus-- OPERATOR (ON PHONE): What is your emergency? Sir? Hello? Sir? This is 911. HICKS: Anybody make a move, and you're history. Got that? DEACON: OK. This one's set. I'll set the charges at Grid 2. We're in. You gonna tell me what the hell you want? Oh, you'll find out soon enough, Mr. McNeil. We know all about you. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): 6 Lincoln 20, a possible 4-15 at Martinson Industries. OFFICER: 6 Lincoln 20. Roger that. I'll keep you advised. Come on, you've gotta warn somebody. [BAR MUSIC PLAYING] BARGOER: Two bucks says you don't make it. BARGOER 2: I can make it. [INDISTINCT CHATTING] Hi. What can I get you? Cold beer. BARTENDER: That'll be $2. Haven't seen you in here before. Haven't been here before. VAN EARL (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Roy, it's Van Earl. Do you read me? Yeah. What's up? VAN EARL (ON WALKIE TALKIE): First black-and-white's here. Evening, Officer. What can I do for you? -We got a 911 call. -All right. You guys ready up there? VAN EARL (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): All set. Notice anything strange or out of the ordinary? No, can't say that I have. Send the message. Is this the main complex? Yeah. Yeah, right here. -OK. I'll check it out. Thank you. OK. [GRUNT] 41 and 30. Officer needs assistance! Repeat, officer needs help! OPERATOR (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Say again, you're breaking up. I've got a war going on here! I need help, and I mean, now! [LAUGHTER] That one's on me. Thanks. You look like a guy with a lot on his mind. That obvious, huh? [SIREN] Hey! We're gonna let you run an errand, Gramps. You're going to go meet the cops outside. Understand? You give them this tape. Take it. Then you hurry your little ass back here, Gramps, or, guess what? Melba here is going to be toast. Go. Hey, Rookie, don't choke. [LAUGHTER] BARGOER: You missed it. -[SIGH] You just lost a ten spot. Not if you're gonna cheat. You calling me a cheater? Why don't you quit while you're still ahead? What are you gonna do? Arrest me? Yeah. We heard about you. You couldn't cut it as a cop. ANCHOR (ON TV): --with a special report. It seems a group of unidentified people-- possibly terrorists-- have taken over Martinson Industries in Sun Valley and are holding hostages. At this point, we don't know why they've attacked Martinson Industries or what their possible motives could be. The police have sealed off the entire facility. As of yet, there's been no contact with the people inside. Wait a second. REPORTER (ON TV): That's Mr. McNeil, the plant manager. The guys are serious. They've taken my entire crew hostage. REPORTER (ON TV): What do they want? I don't know, but if I don't get back, they're gonna kill another person-- REPORTER (ON TV): Wait a second! No, I can't risk it! Now, stay put! All right. It looks as though the terrorists have handed over a cassette tape to the police. I have to assume it's their demands. It doesn't look good for the people inside. -Perimeter secured? -Yes, sir. Get me the FBI on the double. You, you, get rid of the press. Now. OFFICER: Right away, sir. Get me a cassette player. KRUGER (ON CASSETTE PLAYER): This is Stein Kruger. As you know, my people are holding hostages, and they're heavily armed. If they see any SWAT, any police, within 300 yards, the hostages will pay. You have no alternative but to release me from Atwater state prison. If I am not at the plant in one hour, my people will start killing hostages. And of course, no one wants to see this happen. Do they? Time for some fresh air. I hate to say, I told you so. You'll be back. Count on it. [GRUNTING] I won't be back. [MOANING] KRUGER: Let's go, gentlemen. No, I can't risk it! DAVIS (VOICEOVER): Do you know why you were called before the review board, Agent McNeil? [GUNSHOT] DISTURBED MAN: (YELLING) What about all the money I gave you? Fuck! You wanna die like him? Look at him! Fuck you. I'm not going to prison! Look at this punk! [INAUDIBLE] [GUNSHOT] DAVIS (VOICEOVER): You disobeyed my direct order. McNeil? I am in the building, McNeil. You will hold your position. You will talk this man out of it, McNeil. ALEC (VOICEOVER): Yes, Supervisor Davis, I did. But we were dealing with a psycho. I couldn't risk it. [YELLING] ALEC (VOICEOVER): People's lives were at stake. I made a decision to go in. We will talk him out, but you must wait for me. (SCREAMING) I'm not going to prison! No fucking way! I'm not going back to prison, you hear me? You wanna die like him? Don't you fucking look at me! POLICEWOMAN: Alec, this guy's gonna kill somebody else. Davis, this guy's crazy. I've gotta go in now. [GUNSHOT] [SHOUT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAM] [GUNSHOTS] DAVIS (VOICEOVER): Agent McNeil, you disobeyed my orders, and your partner's dead. I'm suspending you till further notice. ALEC (VOICEOVER): Don't bother, Davis. I quit. ROY: Chlorine tanks are full. Oh! Looks like you don't have to work for us. (LAUGHING) You're going to help us compose a nice little concoction here. All right. We got a flow rate of 8 liters per minute, constant temperature of 93 degrees. I'll just set the time constants. Voila! We're ready to cook! Where did to get your training? The state paid for it. All right. Now, I want you to mix what's in the barrel with the chlorine. I'm supposed to guess what that is? It's trouble. Do it. (CHUCKLING) Gramps, if you don't do it, someone's going to die. Oh, you're gonna be John Wayne, is that it? All right. BOB: I hope you're aware that mixing anything with chlorine is highly dangerous. ROY: Just take care of the flow regulator. We know what we're doing. Now, we're gonna start with the intermittent cascade over a 3-centimeter drip. Ruben! RUBEN: Yes, sir. This will be the command center. RUBEN: OK. DAVIS: Commander Simpson? SIMPSON: Supervisor Davis, we spoke on the phone. What's the status of Kruger? -He'll be here. SIMPSON: I've got SWAT ready to roll. Leave SWAT on ice for now. SIMPSON: I think we should go in, Supervisor. These people are dangerous. I know, but I don't want a massacre in my hands. Our position is, we'll try to talk them out [INAUDIBLE] What I'd like to know is why they took over a plant that recycles old plastics. I was asking myself the same thing. Maybe Kruger can tell us when he gets here. [INAUDIBLE] --[INAUDIBLE] Send that to headquarters. Gentlemen, your attention, please. We are dealing with an elite group of mercenaries, some of the best in the world. Stein Kruger-- serving consecutive life sentences for the murder of eight US servicemen at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Over $20 million in weapons were taken by Kruger and his men, and you can bet they didn't wind up in the hands of the good guys. Kruger has been linked to the people on the board behind me. I believe this is the team that has taken over the plant. They're highly trained, and it won't be easy. Our job is to get them all. Uh, Ruben, where's our list of chemical compounds I asked for? I'm working on it. DAVIS: Work faster. -Right. I gotta start going to church-- a lot. [COAT RIPPING] Double-check everything on level two. KESACK (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Roy, do you read me? Hey, Kesack. What's going on? What's the problem? KESACK (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): The pump is slowing down. All right. Double the flow rate. We'll pump it up. We're way behind. Roger. Pump it up six centimeters. You're gonna get us all killed. Just do it! Odell. $1 OFFICER (ON PHONE): I've got an Alec McNeil here. He says he's looking for you. What? Yeah. Let him in. ODELL: Am I seeing a ghost? What the hell are you doing here, man? Odell, who's in charge? You don't want to know. Alec, Davis doesn't want to see you. What the hell is he doing here? Non-personnel are not allowed in this area, Odell. My father's inside. We're doing everything we can. I want to be part of the team. You resigned, McNeil. You're a civilian now. It's not your show. Come on, Alec. [PHONE RINGING] ROY (ON PHONE): If I don't see Kruger in the next 3 minutes, a hostage dies. Look, I already told you. Kruger is on his way. You know, we could sure use you on this one. I'm sorry. So am I. [SIREN] The man is here. I'm at the complex. Belize, 1987. You had so much to kill, I had to carry you out. Welcome aboard, Boss. KRUGER (ON PHONE): I'm coming in. Roger. Isolated frequencies, just you and me. Lovely. I want the hostages. Once I'm inside. You know, there's no way I'm gonna let you out of there. Finally got that list you requested, sir. It's about time. Let's get to work. I'm glad to have you back. I thought you were in Guyana. I was. But, uh, Louise wanted to come home. KRUGER (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Are you there, Davis? You're probably ready to hear my plan now. DAVIS (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Let's get on with it. Getting impatient, Davis? Cut the foreplay, Kruger. I told you what it would cost you-- 30 million in uncut stones. DAVIS (ON WALKIE TALKIE): Stones? As in gemstones? Diamonds, Davis, nothing less than VVS1. D color, I presume? KRUGER (ON WALKIE TALKIE): That's right, Davis. You catch on quick. Completely untraceable. And then what, Mr. Kruger? And then, you get your hostages, become a hero, I retire, and we all live happily ever after. DAVIS (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): It's going to take time. Two hours, Davis. The next time we talk, it'll be because you have my diamonds. Boy, you sure made his day. [CHUCKLE] Get on the [INAUDIBLE] to Hollister's. I want those diamonds immediately. Right. What do I tell him? Whatever it takes. Get those diamonds. Yes, sir. What's your plan? First, we trade the hostages for the diamonds. After that, Kruger's going to come out, right? -Right. -Then we'll hit him. Everything we've got. Ruben? Where do you think you're going? -The bathroom. [GRUNT] -Who the hell are you? -Health department. We got a complaint. [INAUDIBLE] Listen, I gotta call you back. [SIGH] Supervisor, you're not gonna like this. Sir, they, um-- they found his truck, but there's no sign of McNeil. -Great. Van Earl, this is Bishop. Do you read me? Van Earl, do you read me? Van Earl, do you read me? This is Bishop. [GROANING IN PAIN] Where are the hostages? Huh? Where? (GROANING) First [INAUDIBLE] floor. What, are you lying? -Yeah. -Huh? [GROANING] How many are you? Fuck you. [SCREAMING] OK. I've got ten. -Who's your boss? -Kruger. Kruger. What's his plan? What's his plan! [SCREAMING] OK. OK. He said something with the chemical tanks. That's all I know. [SCREAMING] Ouch. Yeah, I've got it under control, Chief. Kruger's not suicidal. Right. No, we're not dealing with terrorists, strictly mercenaries. Yes, Your Honor. He's-- he's right here. Yes, sir. Can you hold on, please? Thank you. There's nothing political about it. Sir, it's the mayor. Tell him to wait. No, sir. No, no. Not you. KRUGER: Status, Roy. We're 12 minutes behind, Boss. This equipment's ain't worth shit. The processing tank is overheating. KRUGER: I'll take care of this myself. Pump it up. You're begging for a major melt-down. I'm telling you, the seals won't tolerate the pressure. Yes, they will. The temperature's reset. How's the flow rate? ROY (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): It's getting better. If anyone gives you any trouble, kill them. What does Kruger know that we don't? I looked at all the chemicals, and nothing on-site poses a threat. Then why did he choose this place? ODELL: Sir, here's more info on one of the mercs. It says here this Roy Eckern has a master's degree in chemistry. Certainly hope you'd kept up your grades. Finished with this area? That's correct. When the tanks are ready, set double charges on each. Deacon, prepare the entrance to the tunnels. [BEEPING] OPERATOR (ON PHONE): FBI Field Operation. Patch me through to Supervisor Davis. It's code 93. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Yes, sir. Command center, Agent Ruben. ALEC (ON PHONE): Put Davis on the line. Who's this? McNeil. Hold on. Sir, it's McNeil on line 1. DAVIS: You made it into the plant, didn't you? ALEC (ON PHONE): That's right. DAVIS: You just don't learn, McNeil. ALEC (ON PHONE): Sometimes, you just have to do what's right. Do you want my help, or not? What's the head count on the mercs? There were ten. Now, there's eight. Kruger's doing something with the chemical tanks. I don't know what it is, yet. But I'm gonna go in for a closer look. Wait a minute, McNeil. There's no time. You've just gotta trust me on this one. (SIGHING) I hope he can pull it off. Hands behind your head. Go ahead. Try it. It's for you. Thanks for saving my ass back there. Thank me over dinner sometime, if we ever get out of here. We'll get out of here. Alec, they're processing chlorine with some type of phosphorus base. What does that mean in layman's terms? Look, I read about some kind of nerve gas they're developing. It could create a lethal cloud halfway to Tijuana. What if I could drain the tanks? That would work. There's an emergency drain system on level one. It runs to the waste dump outside the main complex. Then, the mercs would be out of luck. Yeah. The compound they're making is ending up in tank number three. All right. Can you get back to the phone box? Get 911 to patch you through to FBI. Let 'em know what's going on here. OK. You know how to use that? I think so. I'm sorry. OK. Get going. Good luck. -OK. You, too. Kruger, we got a problem here. Someone took out Belasco on level three. I copy. Is the rest of the C4 in place? DEACON: Not yet. Get it done, quick. Kruger, I want whoever did this. So do I. Now, get moving. Wood, we've got someone inside. Sweep the plant with Jackson. Start on level three. Roger. You think Davis sent somebody in? Not his style. I don't see how we could have missed the hostage. This isn't a hostage. How much time? 10 minutes, max. Not a second longer. ROY: Process impromptu shutdown. KRUGER: Come on. Let's go. You're going to kill us all. Switch to auxiliary, now. Gotta wait till the tank cools down! You've got two minutes to get the auxiliary pump up and running. [SCREAMING] Hicks, send another hostage to the tanks. Roger. Hey, you. Come here. [MUFFLED SCREAMING] Attaboy, Gramps. You know, you still might get that pension. [LAUGHTER] ROY: Hey. Come here! Come here! JACKSON: Oh, man! I don't believe this! Listen, Bishop's checked out. Find this son of a bitch. I wanna know who the hell he is. Right. We're on it, Boss. I'll sweep this level. You sweep the next one. Move it. I found him. KRUGER (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Get this fucker. I want him alive. You got it. All right. Come on. You're coming with me. KRUGER (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Wood! Jackson! Do you read me? They're not reading anybody. Enough playing. Who are you? Telephone repair. FBI? Not anymore. The guy in the truck, right? I'm impressed. I'll be seeing you real soon, Kruger. DEACON (ON RADIO): Tanks are full! -Time to rock and roll, Boss! -Good. Now I'm gonna take this son of a bitch out. Everybody go to code six. Kesack, relieve Hicks. Roger. Hicks, meet me at the tanks. Yeah, I got it, Boss. KRUGER: Nakata, you hook up with Deacon. Deacon, stay there. I'm on my way. Hey! Anything? McNeil hasn't called yet, sir. What about the diamonds? On the way. [LOUD RINGING] He's not going to be flying that helicopter now, is he? We'll use the old man. He's a chopper pilot. DAVIS: What about the tracers? ODELL: They're sewn into lining of the cases, sir. DAVIS: Good. Hicks, Deacon said he went to level three. We'll corner him there. The goods are here. Of course, they are. Where are the hostages? Come on! Out of there! Not too far. I only see nine, Kruger. You'll get the rest when I get safely away. That's not the deal. It's my show, Davis. How do you think you're gonna get out of here? Do you know what happens when you process chlorine with DLT? I believe it creates a nerve gas, sir. Good. Unless you want to be remembered for solving the population problem in Los Angeles, I suggest you do exactly what I say. We'll be leaving here shortly. The entire plant is wired with explosives, and this is the trigger. If I hit this, we all lose. Don't even think about following. This has a range of 1,000 miles. If I even see one cop anywhere near me, you'll pay dearly. It will take your bomb squad at least two hours to unravel my handiwork after we leave, and that's all the head start I need. Is that all? Don't you want your hostages? Thank you, gentlemen. "Nothing on-site poses a threat." They must have brought it with them. I should have known. We both should've known. Put the stones in this. You know it's rigged with tracers. Hasn't let me down, yet. KRUGER: Deacon should have broken through to the tunnels by now. It's time to leave the FBI a little joy ride. ROY: Good. I can't wait to get the hell out of here. [CRUMPLING PAPER] Don't get any bright ideas, Gramps. -Call me Gramps again. -Enough. We need a helicopter pilot, and you've just been recruited. I'm staying right here. Captain goes down with his ship, is that it? [GROANING] All right. We got your point. [GRUNTING] What the hell are you going to do with me? I'm giving you your freedom. All you have to do is follow my instructions exactly. [BEEPING] Have a nice trip. KRUGER (ON RADIO): The exit doors in front of you will open automatically in three minutes. Do not remove yourself from the seat until then. [BEEPING CONTINUES] -Shit. Goddamn it! [LOUD BUZZING] -Argh! Shit! KRUGER (ON RADIO): That was your warning. Now, listen carefully. Look at the timer. Remember, 40 miles in 60 minutes. If not, you're history. DEACON: Popped through the walls through those old tunnels, just like you said, Boss. Davis, we're leaving now. Would you like anything for your trip? Developing a sense of humor, this late in the game? Humor the rest of Los Angeles, and stay out of my way. They're on the move. Let's go, Parker. Come on. Come on, come on. Open up, you-- [BEEPING] Fuck this. [SCREECHING] [BEEPING] We got a signal. (YELLING) OK, guys, move it! Bomb squad, move it! Move it! Odell, keep back a safe distance. I'll radio you when the bomb squad deactivates the explosive. -Right. [SIREN] BOB: (YELLING) How did you find these? I've done my homework, McNeil. Now, keep moving. [MICE SQUEAKING] Let's go! Move, move! Two more, down here! This one's deactivated. KRUGER (ON RADIO): Stay on San Fernando till you reach me. Come on, come on. ODELL (ON RADIO): They've just turned off San Fernando and are headed south on Main. [COUGHING] This is it. [BANGING] [BEEPING] Only 18 minutes to go. Come on, baby. Come on, you son of a bitch. Move. Get the hell out of the way! You jackass! KRUGER (ON RADIO): Stay on Main Street until Pacific Avenue. Then, go right. ODELL: They're turning West onto Pacific Drive. All units stay in position. [BEEPING] [PANTING] ROY: Get in! Make yourselves comfortable. It's going to be a long trip. Try and get us there in one piece. All right. KRUGER (ON RADIO): I hope you're checking the timer. Come on. Come on! KRUGER (ON RADIO): 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. [INAUDIBLE] If you can hear this, you're still alive. Congratulations. You made it. (SIGHING) Oh! Yeah. ODELL (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Supervisor Davis? You got him? Not exactly. DAVIS (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): What are you saying, Odell? Well, sir, the mercs aren't in the truck. DAVIS (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): What do you mean they're not in the truck? ODELL (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Well, sir, it was a decoy. Bomb squad just deactivated the C4. Let's go! Move! Deacon, take our guests out of the sun. The rest of us will handle the chopper. DEACON: Straight in there. Move it! In! On our way! 30 minutes, we're in Mexico. Then, onto Brazil. [GRUNTING] Stay over there. ALEC: You OK? What took you so long? Couldn't catch a cab. [LAUGHTER] [GRUNTING IN PAIN] [GUNSHOT] What's going on? We'll check it out, Boss. Hang on. Look, they don't know I'm here. I'm going to get their attention. You take this, and you go that way. -All right. -Take care of him. Be careful. LYNNE: We're almost there. [BREATHING HEAVILY] -OK? -Get this-- get the tie. OK. Easy, easy, easy, easy. All right. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's not you. Oh, man! Oh, damn! Hey, Kruger. Go ahead. ROY (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Deacon's dead. What? Find them. We need the old man. Roger. Come on. Let's split up. I'll take this one. Ha! Get up. You're coming with me. Drop the gun. You're not gonna shoot me. [SCREAMING] Should've bought American. KRUGER: (YELLING) You don't let go, do you! I told you I'd be seeing you, Kruger! Who the hell are you! I'm the guy who's taking you back! Why! Because you're not a nice guy. I could use a man like you! How does two million sound? Why don't you make it 20? I guess I'm going to have to kill you, then! In a way, that makes me feel good! I don't believe it! You fucked with the wrong guy. You should have taken my offer. You fucked with the wrong guy. [SCREAMING] You lose. Go ahead. I'm not going back. [LAUGHTER] Davis. Davis. McNeil? I got him. You got him? Great! McNeil. ALEC (ON WALKIE-TALKIE): Yeah. If you want to come back-- Catch me on a better day, Davis. Let's get that leg taken care of. We still going trout fishing? I could use a vacation. I think we all could. Nice to have you back, Kruger. [LAUGHTER] McNeil. [THEME MUSIC]
