What is your first memory? My first memory is that my parents were perfect. It's not true that my father was a homosexual. My father was a sheik. All the women loved him madly. And he was also a king of the financial jungle. All those millionaire Greek tigers and German apes were afraid of him. He was a captain of industry. And very, very rich. He was a test pilot who flew and flew and flew. He was Beau Brummell. He owned airlines and oil and steel and half of Peru and all of Guatemala. He knew everybody, just everybody, and some of his paintings were acquired from very most important Nazis. Before and after that particular war and even during. There was no one who didn't want to know him. And, naturally, I loved him. Why the hell do you let that child run up into my bathroom? What in the hell do you think you are being paid for? My mother was not only perfect, but a great beauty. She had been working as a cigarette girl when she met my father. It is not true that my mother ever made stag films. My mother was Cinderella. Sleeping beauty. A queen on a glass mountain. She was one of the greatest hostesses in the world. And everyone wanted to come to her parties. And my father gave her jewels. And jewels and jewels. I adored her. You had to adore her. Why did my little precious cut her hair? Oh, Madame... Oh, darling, darling. Oh! You can spend one night with your own kid. One night. Shut up, Astrid. You're drunk. Tell it to your analyst. What I do is my own business. I pick my own friends. Whether they run restaurants, or barmaids, or call girls. Well, you can't behave like a hooker in my house. I don't need... Who can't behave like a hooker in whose house? Peaches. My house is my palace. There's no man living I've enjoyed it with anyway. In my heart of hearts, I'm a sexual clam. Shut up, Astrid. You're a damn fishwife! Least I'm normal. You have all the manners, Astrid, of the gutter. Of a prize, blue-ribboned pig! I hate you. I'll always hate you. Mr. Steele, I'm sorry. Bloody wine. Get the hell out of my way. Kid's going on a plane. TWA at 9:00 tonight. Switzerland. School. See to it that she gets on it for me, will you, Jack? Daddy and Mummy had made a mistake. My plane from California to Switzerland was not supposed to leave until the next night. I spent the night at the apartment of the maitre d'. He was very nice. I played poker half the night with his wife and two sons. They really loved me. Most people do. And I grew and I grew and I grew. I grew too large in fact. Fat one might call it. My name is Tara Nicole. My last name is Steele. And I'm a fairy princess. Willy, do you think Tara Nicole will be prettier when she comes home? She'll be fat, Astrid. Fat. Please. She's our baby. Willy, we're going to give her the biggest coming out party that anyone has ever seen in this idiot City of the Angels. We'll get Yves Saint Laurent to fix her and Sidney Guilaroff to do her make-up and her hair. And simple jewelry. One uncut diamond. And we'll invite all the young people. Nancy Sinatra and and the Mamas and the Papas and Mama Cass will make her feel... Oh, Willy. Willy, Willy. I've even been faithful with you for 10 years. God help us. You are a beautiful girl. I know, I know. If only mother could wait until I lost 75 pounds and then have my coming out party. Boy, could we flatten them then. I mean, the right way, in your dress. You don't get to work on Greta Garbo every day, right? Every woman's face is beautiful. All one does is guess how unique. And bingo. That's what I need to look like? Could you excuse me a minute? It'll be beautiful. Oh, yes of course. Well, God bless my bleeding heart. And what's left for Mummy to wear. Your mother is wearing the greatest necklace in the world, darling. Marie Antoinette lost her head over it. And so did your mother. In fact, I don't think your mother's wearing anything but the necklace. Oh, wow! Maybe I should just wear all of them. I could pin them all over the dress, right down to the ground. I'll be a mountain of love beads. You wear this one necklace and you'll look beautiful, Tara Nicole. I'm fat and dopey. And I need a bracelet to cover up a cut that I got playing ice hockey, this afternoon. I'd give you anything in the world. Thank you. You gave me everything. Why, even flying lessons. Someday, you and me, and sweet little Mummy in a plane with me flying. And I'll teach you all of the little dirty tricks I know. Tara, don't. I couldn't stop your mother from giving this kind of party. To show me off? Or to show off her body and her beads? Mother was a cigarette girl. That must have been one hell of a pack of cigarettes she sold you. One puff and your private parts went up in smoke. And is Mummy coming by to tell me how beautiful I look, too? Yes. Do you like me in white? I'm a rare species. I'm an 18-year-old virgin Americanus. Not many of them there kind left. On my way home from London... The Savoy, do you know I actually thought of solving my problem by way of an elevator boy? I was going to pay him. Stop it! Well, I tried, but he didn't seem to understand. Language barrier. Cockney. I've been finished at finishing school and untouched by a human hand. Oh, my God! Mother. Oh, baby. You have to be feeling miserable. I know it. I hate myself for doing this to you. I did it for myself. I've wanted it to be perfect for you, but it is my dream. While they were doing my hair I was thinking, "Astrid, idiot. You wanted this. "You planned it when you were sitting on the Santa Monica pier "aged 10, selling... Dear God! "Cotton candy! "Tara Nicole doesn't want it. "You want it." Oh, darling, I love the rings, all of them. But your hair. I think we can make it prettier, huh? Oh, so much prettier. Oh, baby, baby it is my party. I know it. For me. Just sail through it. And I promise you I'll never do it to you again. # Angel, angel # Down we go # Where you've never # Been before # Angel, angel # Down we go # Through the door # Beyond the door # Take my hand and come on follow me # To the shore of your eternity # Swirling, swirling, ever so slow # Dreaming, screaming # Angel, angel, down we go # Angel, angel, down we go # Virgin child, its time you tried to fly # You can't be reborn until you die # It's beginning, look out below # Spinning, grinning # Angel, angel, down we go # Angel, angel, down we go # Angel, angel, down we go # Down we go, down we go # Down we go # When you don't know where you're going # Don't know where you're going # And you don't know where you'll be # Don't know where you'll be # There's just one way of getting out # And it's here # When you don't know why you're sinking # Don't know why # And you feel like you're gonna die # Feel like you're gonna die # The only way I know I'm going up is # Going down, going down # Going down, going down # Angel, angel, down we go # Angel, angel, down # We go Hi, everybody. Hi. Hi. Oh, groovy. Oh! That's where I need to be, on my hands and knees. Well, what the hell do you think you're doing? Almost killed you, baby. Yeah, well, you didn't. Well, it was your luck. You sing it and I'll tap my foot. You want to try again? Not now. Get in, but fast. But fast. Just can't bear those parties for fat girls. I'm the fat girl. I know. Can you pilot a plane? Yes. Yeah, they told me that, too. Who the hell are you? You know damn well who I am. A freaked out singer. Ring-a-ding-ding-a-ling-ding. I don't even know your name. Bogart, as in the real Humphrey. My mother went into labor pains during a Bogart flick. Machine guns. She almost dropped me in the lobby. Born in the back of a Ford. My father was a cop. Delivered me in a parking lot. Now long live Bogart Peter Stuyvesant. I don't give a damn about your money. I just sold one of three record companies for two million dollars. So why were you there tonight? I wanted to see Freaksville. Your father just gave away a half a million acres of redwoods for a national park. Is that any way to run an airlines, baby? You bet it is. Where are we going? You fly. I jump. What difference does it make to you where we go? Your family, your body, your past, you've lost everything already. I'll bet a dollar and a half you've never been had. I bet you think I'm kinky, right? Yes. Yeah, but I'm not a loser, you are. Right up until right now, baby. Wow, your breath stinks. Your breath stinks. Oh, please. Oh, no, no, no, no. I dig it. I dig it. He's dreaming. Who? Bogie owns us. He steals dreams. Don't dream around him. Unless you want your dreams to happen, baby. He's the analyst gone mad. Born inside a movie house, inside a television set, that generation. Lots of violence in that scene. Bogie knocked his father's teeth out when he was 12, just for the pleasure of it. Right after he saw King Kong. Enough, baby. That's enough. How much is enough? None of your damned business. My name is Anna Livia. Tara Nicole Steele. This is my new group. I'm going to produce them. Maybe with me, maybe without me. Joe, Santoro. I think I'm going to call them the Rabbit Habit. Great. # Little skinny people who look like barber poles # Have little skinny minds and hearts and super skinny souls # Now who ever said that you have to look like that # But we say hip hurray, hip, hip hurray for fat # Growing up and growing out # That's what life is all about # Growing high, growing wide # Leave you lots of room inside # Come on do it fast # Do it slow # But don't you be afraid to grow # Take a boney body, what does it really mean # It's just a skeleton with skin and nothing in between # Now those kind a folks are no fun to have around # So, when we pick our friends we pick them by the pound # Growing up and growing out # That's what life is all about # Growing high, growing wide # Leaves you lots of room inside # Come on do it fast # Do it slow # But don't you be afraid to grow # Up, baby, you're going to fly. Fly what? My plane. Oh. I thought I was flying all night. You were. Why would you want to trust me with your plane? Now don't be an idiot. Nobody goes skydiving because it's safe. An under-aged, unknown pilot. You just add to the kicks, lady. Or don't you believe in the fall of the American Empire? What? Rome. Where'd you go to school at? Switzerland, London, finishing school. Quite right. You're quite finished. American imperialism is your dream. I don't know anything about... You've a right to that dream. You're not a bloody dropout. Enjoy yourself. And screw anyone who hates killing. You've got to call the police. She is a missing person. I can't call the police. I've got men working on it. Your kind of men. Detectives. Your detectives. We need the police. All the police ever give anyone ever is publicity. Besides, you gave the party so that she could meet someone. Oh, you're out of your Chinese skull. She didn't meet anyone. Who would... Who would what? Want her? She's worth a half a billion dollars. Stop, Hopkins, you're hurting me. You're a bloody, sadistic dike. She's in trouble. I know it. And you know it, or you wouldn't be here. You'd be in Hong Kong. One would think you really cared. I love her. She's all... She's all I have. Mother love. One would scarcely dream. I have another late bulletin for you. She's all you have. I don't have you? You only own me. That's the only way anyone can have anyone, anything, free love and communism notwithstanding. As for Tara Nicole, she belongs to the world. And you just happened to have missed your chance at being dear mama. And you're growing older, Astrid. Madame has a child's skin. Madame is going mad. Demon drives! Bogie drives! Bless the child in me. Bogie is God! Demon drives! I don't think my mother was a hooker at all. But they said that my father spent, oh, why his millions, so what the hell? Buying up dirty films she'd made. It's all untrue. Poor bitch. She only sold cigarettes. Ordinary cigarettes. Phone home. Phone home. Phone home. Phone home. Phone home. Phone home. I don't want to phone home. Your mama's gotta be turning blue with panic. And your papa's probably called his bosom buddies. You know, the kind he had in the Army, Navy and Marines. I sat on General MacArthur's knee when I was two. Did it excite him? I was only a baby girl. You've got to call your mother. I got to go in. I got a recording session. No, I want to stay here with them. No, they're coming with me. I've got to make them moneymakers. Republicans. Comme il faut. Bogart. Bogie, I love you. Fast. Fast. Fast. Fast. And don't be ashamed to take me home and introduce me to mums and dads. Our town. A boy and a girl. A man and a woman. Say you're going to bring friends home. Me. Them. Them. Me. Them. Them. Joe. Anna Livia. Santoro. The Rabbit Habits. The Shoots. The Free Falls. Whatever I'll call them. What the hell will I call them? I didn't kidnap you. You did. I want ransom then. What? Ransom. What? Maybe your mother. No! Or maybe I'll take your father. The male Amelia Earhart. He didn't get lost. He got rich instead. Of course, your father doesn't know much about throwing parties. We could teach him. You'd really enjoy yourself. With or without Mother. Mmm, mama. With mama. Hi, everybody. Hi. Wow. This is groovy. We're having a party. Hi! Oh! Mommy. I love you. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. Damn right! Damn right! You were born rich. I was born poor! But I have class. Class. You don't! You don't get class in finishing school. But then what am I? You were brought up by maids. Maids and chauffeurs! You'll grow up. You'll make it with chauffeurs! Even in stag movies I knew chauffeurs were chauffeurs. And beneath me. My father read books. Books. I think the fat girl is sweet. Like the Lennon sisters. I cried when the Lennon sisters got married one after another. Four separate crying jags. He read books behind the cotton candy counter. Your father reads the Wall Street Journal. Only. Oh, lady, the baby needs tender loving care. Sugar pills. Hi, everybody. Groovy. Groovy. Groovy. I knew a rock singer once. Who used to drink, you know, like old-fashioned stuff. Alcohol. Do you know alcohol is coming back? Quaint. They didn't even call the police. Why? Well, Daddy said... One just couldn't. And then Mummy cried. And Daddy was supposed to go to Hong Kong yesterday. To buy China. But he postponed the whole trip because of me. Oh, and he's not going to leave until he sees me in my glorious flesh. Does Mummy cry all the time? Yes. Well, it must be an allergy. Hay fever. Well, mostly we'd like to have a lot of children. I mean, you can see Tara Nicole would make a great mother. I mean, a really enormous mother. And being an only child, I mean, I'm one of a kind myself. You can see, it just doesn't work out. Look at the both of us. Crazy. I don't know whether we want to raise our children in America. You know what I mean? Hell, I'm ready to retire now. I mean, I'm not as rich as you are, Mr. Steele, but, baby, am I rich. Hmm, yeah and God bless America. But it depresses me seeing poor people here. Yeah. Take waiters in plush restaurants. Yeah, compared to us, face it, man, they're poor. See, now, poor Arabs don't depress me. Not even poor Frenchmen. Not even starving Hindus, 'cause baby, they're not us. They're not our kind. They're not Americans. God bless, Danny the Red, but that's his problem. Man, like, oh, wow, I was really poor, man. Before I cut my first record I lived on mustard sandwiches. Mustard sandwiches for a week. Yeah, my mother always said anyway the next war's going to be between the blacks and the whites. And she was right. No one's safe here. Not that I wouldn't give my life for Joe. But guess who's coming to dinner? Yeah, forget it. But I got to touch of the tar brush myself. Yeah. I happen to know that I'm one thirty-second pure purple-black Afro-Negro. Yeah, and I got the documents to prove it. Not to say that I haven't really dug some spade chicks. Well, a guy's not supposed to be a virgin. You know. Hey, how old were you when you first got laid, Mr. Steele? Man, I remember the first chick I laid. Oh, I was standing up behind a garage. Oh, oh excuse me. Wow. That's like what we call locker room talk. God, I'm a dope. Marrying gets a guy nervous. A guy nervous, yeah. Well, the path of true love always did jump over a couple of really tired jokes, anyway. Freud said that. Yeah. God, if I don't shut up you're going to think I'm some kind of mental case. Well, I mean, Saint Francis licked the wounds of lepers. Talking to birds. If he did that today, man, they'd lock him up. You know that. Shakespeare. Shakespeare said that Joan of Arc was six months pregnant when they burned her. Her privilege. And the hell with George Bernard Shaw! Wow! Oh, I'm scared of you two. You know, because you really are a great looking couple. A great looking couple. And I love your daughter and I want to marry her. And it's unbelievable. Yeah, and I hate chairs. I think you should all stay to dinner. We thought maybe we'd all stay overnight. That would be... We're the only family Bogie has. You see, we protect him. We black Afro-Americans believe that that voice of his comes right up from that one thirty-second black Afro-American blood. And as you all know, sexually, black is better, baby. It is. A lot of what he said makes sense. Are you out of your mind? I think you'd better spend a long time in Hong Kong and Tokyo. He's slept with her, hasn't he? Well, he's not going to sleep with her in this house. I'm going to say good night to her seven different times. It's a big house. And I may sleep with her. Why do you hate him? Oh, my God, he's the new public enemy number one. He's got a machine gun. He's the petrified forest with or without that name which I don't for a moment believe. Tara Nicole you named for Tara in Gone with the wind. I liked Gone with the Wind. You'll say goodbye to them for me? Do you like them, Mother? Yes. Do you like him? Yes. But he is the sort that makes you take all sorts of tranquilizers before breakfast, isn't he? And wash them down with Bloodies. Slipping nips and popping pills. What? Slipping nips and popping pills. Oh, lady, lady, baby, what a song. You're my shining star, lady, lady. Maybe I'll adopt you. Maybe you'll adopt me. Huh? # Let me tell you about a lady # Someone everybody knows # Mother lover # Let me tell you about a lady # Always comes up smelling like a rose # Mother lover # She's everywhere you go # You know who I mean # Slipping nips and popping pills # She's the all-American # Mother machine # Oh, bloody mama, you're my shining star # Oh, bloody mama # Oh, what a mother, what a mother # What a mother you are # Now I just met her mother # And I ain't telling you her name # Mother lover # I'm just telling you this mother When did he write that song? He does it like in a day, an hour. Well, it's appalling. Oh, he's just playing around with it now, you know, doing weird things. He certainly is! # The bigger that they are # The harder they fall # Look at here what have we got # The biggest mother of them all # Damn it! Stop it, stop it. Come on, let's pick it up. Mother! It makes me a damned fool. Nobody will know it's you. I know. Well, they made a song up about me, Mother. About a fat girl and how she grew and she grew. You are a fat girl, idiot. I don't know why anyone would even touch you. # Oh bloody mama now you've gone too far # Oh, well, all right, yeah # Mother lover # Mother lover, mother lover, lover mother, yeah # Mother lover # Mother lover See now, you've got to get high, lady, lady, to see. High, high, high, high. High on pot, high on a high diving board, jump from an airplane, lady, lady. Climb the top of Mount Everest. Yeah, you see all the way up and all the way down. You know, birth control can be controlled in the mind. You don't need a pill. All you do is say I'm not going to get pregnant and you don't get pregnant. It's mind over all that sort of matter. Everyone thinks I don't know who the father of my baby is. I do. But I don't tell. There's no privacy in the world anymore. Except in your skull. I knew a man once did a girl in. Kept her in a gallon of Lysol in the bath. I don't understand a word of what you're... But you've never jumped out of an airplane. And your husband is William Gardiner Steele. The world's largest producer of jets, turbojets, propjets. Is he a fag? Was he a fag? How old are you? Oh, wow! You're insane! You're all insane. I don't know what's the matter with you. Hey, I'd better catch up with lady, lady, huh? Oh, and follow, all of you, in a couple of hours. Hey, stop making decisions, Mother. Let go of me. No, no, you're caught, lady, lady. I'm not caught. Not by anyone. Hey. Take your hands off the lady. I'm all right. She's all right. I don't know why even Tara Nicole puts up with you. Even Tara Nicole? I didn't mean that. Oh, no, that's all right. You can mean anything you want to. That's the big secret. That girl. Anna Livia. She's pregnant because of you. Now maybe, maybe. You see, I'm fairly lovable, you know. But not in the old-fashioned way. What way? Be my guest. I don't know what it means what I got. Look in her hand, Rudy, but don't tell us. She shouldn't stay the night. They've gone, they've gone, they've gone. Where? The father, Palm Springs. Shut up. She's gone God knows where. She should go to hell! She's been there! She came from there! She's what he said she was! Or he's what she said he was! God forgive you! She's got diamonds. All women! All women! All women! You never bought me diamonds. They've got maids. A lousy monkey on the phone. A gardener. Who knows what he was? A fat Jap. You know, I really don't understand. I'm not of your generation. I only get drunk. Occasionally. I only take pills. Sometimes pills work. With liquor. Teamwork. I don't get high. I don't jump off high places. You and your friends, do you want me, or do you want my daughter? Are they mutually exclusive? There's a word for you, but I don't think I even know what it is. Polymorphous perverse. Why don't you leave my daughter alone? The way you did. How dare you! How dare you. Hey, that's a good lyric for a song. Now you see, lady, lady. I'm just a country boy. Born on Avenue B, New York City. Every night from six to 16, I washed out my socks and jockeys. My mother had a mole with hairs growing out of it. She used to punch me in the mouth when I said anyone who stood up during the Star Spangled Banner was a freak. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. Even at how old, how the hell old you are. That mind-snapper, the necklace, the one you wore the other night at the party, like you had nothing else on. That, I want that. You. Bogart doesn't love me. Of course he does. But he doesn't want to ask my mother about... Marrying you? Of course he does. But he's married to me, to all of us. Of course he is. How can I get down off this ceiling? But you're not on the ceiling, baby. I am. I am. Only 11 percent of America is black. Burnt chestnuts. Spade black, dirt black and black, black. Only 11 percent. Baby, they ain't gonna let us win. Win what? Hell, I don't know. We were supposed to win something but I forgot now what it was. I don't think it was the vote I wanted, you know, because those guys who run for president, they you know, they have to dye their hair my color. I guess I was screwed the day I was born. He's with my mother. He's got to be making love to my mother. Forty-five, 45. I'm 45. Forty-five. I can't die. I can't die. I haven't lived yet. I'm falling! Help me! Don't be afraid of it when it gets to real, baby. It was sick. Only the poor know. Only the very poor. What's really real. America doesn't know. America's fat, baby. Good and fat. Oh, God is America fat. And Bogart Peter Stuyvesant loves his country. He's a patriot. I love you. Jump! Jump! Jump! I don't know if I was a virgin or not. He had two. Count them. Two boys. This is fantastic. This is really fantastic. Better not fool around, Tony. Papa said it. # Lady, lady lives in her tower # Dines on her diamonds # Drinks of her tears # Her pleasures are plastic # Her pain is elastic # Stretching over the years # Lady, lady, once gave her favors # In assorted flavors # Savored by kings # Now she's for the taking # And making and breaking # By any young gypsy who sings # Lady, lady, looks in her mirror # Reading her future # In every line # It's too late to reach her # There's too much to teach her # The lady's run out of time Did you really make stag movies? Mmm. Only with cast of thousands. Or dozens, maybe. Five, six at a time. At least. Why? Just a born Communist, I suppose. Share the wealth. Everyone in town says they slept with you. The ones who say they have, haven't. How much are the beads worth? Millions, literally millions. Our 20th anniversary. Years and years of virtue. Does your husband know you make out? Nobody knows it. Even you don't know it. And I don't make out. I gave all that up. Well, you do one hell of a good imitation. I love you. Anna Livia goes skydiving and she's seven months pregnant. No, but you're too old to jump, right? I really am with an old lady. No. Then jump with us. No. Call your husband in Hong Kong. Why? Don't you want to report a jewel thief? No one could break into the vault. You're mad! Oh, lady, lady, that was your generation. You called people mad. Sent them away to booby hatches or put them in the white House. Or gave them a big toy, like ICBM's to play with. Come and get it, lady, lady. Jump for it. Come on, jump for it. Come on, baby. Come on, come and get it. Come on. Come on. Go on, get it. Go on, lady, lady. The queen's beads. Please, please. Please, please. Hey, hey, hey! Oh, baby! Save your soul, Tara Nicole! Red hot. Red hot! Red hot. Get your red hot! Red hot! Red hot! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Red hot! Order in the court. Mother! Mother! Why don't you answer it, lady, lady? You know damn well it's Hong Kong. Yes? Willy? Yes, I can hear you, as though you were in the next room. Or even closer than that. You've got to come home, Willy. I can't possibly come back, Astrid... Willy... It's never been true all the cruel things I've said to you. I've always loved you, Willy. People don't seem to fall in love anymore. The children don't. They... You sound strange, Astrid. Is everything all right? Willy, Willy... I'm going to go skydiving. But you're afraid of planes. Yes, I know. And I know it's been embarrassing to you. I'm sorry. But, well, at my age... I don't have to fly the plane, do I? And it only takes guts to jump. Please come home, Willy. Of course I'll come. Hello, Papa? No, today we go, lady. Today. I want to stop in Santa Monica. It's on the way. Why Santa Monica? The pier. I was born near the pier. Is that the color of your hair? I love you. Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive! Oh, lady, lady, dive for me! I can't! Stand up. Lady, lady wants to jump instead of dive. Are those false eyelashes? No! Who was my governess after Paulette? I don't know. I've forgotten. Fanny the Nazi. That's eight points against the very white lady. Is she finished dressing? I don't understand the game. Fanny was the one with the tattoo. That would make her a Jew, not a Nazi. It wasn't a number she had tattooed on her. Where was the tattoo? I can't tell you. You're not playing the game, baby. Inside, on her thigh. Was it bigger than a bread box? A mermaid. I don't believe it. Truth! Truth! You must believe it. Why did I fire her? For stealing. That was Annie. Fanny, the Nazi! Nine points against her. Annie stole, too. But Fanny was better. In fact, I helped her. Steal what? Your perfumes were missing. That was Annie. Fanny! Ten points! Break something. Hey! Truth! Truth! The hell with all of you. I made 30 stag films and I never faked an orgasm. Oh, beautiful. You really are a great lady. It's true. Yeah, baby. Santa Monica for lady, lady. The brass ring. I don't want to be here. Why? I don't want to be where she came from. She never brought me here. I've never been here before. Why is cotton candy 35 cents? Why are we spending $20 billion to go to the garbage dump on the moon, lady? Do you have green? Pink. Only pink? Big season for pink. Don't cost that much, lady. Hey, you don't have to... Hey! Wait a minute. What are you... Hey, hey! What are you... Hey, that lady... That's my mother. I'm sorry. She's out on a visit. You know, she used to roll $100 bills in the sand and then we really knew something was wrong. Yeah. Hey, look, the peacock's flying. I'm going to be a perfect mother, too. And athletic. Oh, why doesn't he let her go? Oh, you wouldn't want that. The hunter's got to hunt. Let me go. You're running out on me, lady. No one ever ran out on me before. I've never felt anything before. Yeah, but you do now. She's my daughter. You live in another world, lady, and that world is dead. In the Fiji Islands, I read it in a book. At a certain age, the natives make their parents climb up palm trees, and then they shake them down so that Mommy and Daddy can go to paradise with all their teeth and before they're old and before they're bald and feeble. And you'll give me back the necklace? Oh, yes. Mother. I don't want the necklace, poor dear. It's really too large. And it's terribly vulgar. Half in love with easeful death. Then as we fall, free fall, we pass the baton. Me to Joe to Anna Livia to Santoro and then to me. And then to you, Astrid Steele. # There's no road leads to salvation # No way to paradise # And the fires they keep on burning # Calling for a sacrifice # Sing hallelujah # Sing hallelujah # Hallelujah # Sing hallelujah # There is pain in revelation # Joy in judgment day # And there's ecstasy in knowing # Some one's gonna have to pay # Hallelujah # Sing hallelujah # Hallelujah # Sing hallelujah # Strip your soul and count your sins # If you want to be released # Sister, get down on your knees # Truth is still the highest priest # None of us can be redeemed # We're all damned by what we've dreamed # We all know that it's too late # So lift your voice and celebrate # Hallelujah # Nothing is and no one # So wash your hands in the blood of the lamb # Hallelujah # Sing hallelujah # Hallelujah # Sing hallelujah You see, draft board told me to go home. They asked me if I were homosexual. I said, "Baby man, I am just sexual. "I mean, sometimes I can just stare at a carrot. "And that, baby man, that carrot can turn me on." I'm afraid of dying. I'm afraid to have the baby. When I was born, when they brought me to my mother in the hospital, and she unwrapped me she said there was blood between my legs. She said it was a sign. She said that it meant if I ever had a child that I would die. I'm going to be old, an old, old, old maid. No, not maid, Anna Livia. Oh, no it's too late for that. Who cares about a 35-year-old virgin? God cares. He hasn't sent any doves, not down to me. Birth, Mother, what was birth like? I don't know. I had the best doctors. They put you out. I don't remember. Why do you hate me? I didn't go after anyone, ever. She didn't promise you a rose garden, Tara Nicole. Ah, with this love of the land it'll come to you. Katie Scarlett O'Hara. The good earth of Tara. Could you still have children, Mother? You really are retarded. I could bring forth nations. Too late, too late, Astrid Steele. But you didn't. You brought forth me! Why aren't you in the army, Bogart Peter Stuyvesant? A war hero, like your husband in the last, lovely, major war? Yes. Why should I go out and kill mere strangers? When there are much more luscious pickings right here in my own backyard? In my own bedroom? This is my bedroom, you know. Land of dreams. Do you dream about dying Astrid Steele? I am the last old-fashioned girl, Mother. Fat girls are a remembrance of things past. Twiggy only dates back to Buchenwald. # Ain't it a magical morning # Ain't it a dream of a day # You got nothing to lose by throwing your blues away # All you gotta say is hey, hey, hey # Hi ho # Well, get yourself some good time get up and go # Hey, hey, hey and a hi ho # I'm all for trying a little flying # To get you high when you're low # It's all right, darling. Don't worry about Mummy. I was champion leg wrestler at Santa Monica High my first year. The year you dropped out. All sports I've picked up easily. I was a great beauty. I'm still a great beauty. I gave you nine months of my life and you've stolen my necklace. I promise you, you'll be buried in it. Or make father promise that. You're a natural. Just enjoy yourself, baby. It's Willy! Just wave to him, Astrid. - But I want... - Just wave to him. Peace in our time! Peace that passeth understanding. Each man kills! Nothing to fear, but fear itself. Don't worry, Papa. We'll take care of you, too. Truly, we will. I really never thought of having a profession. But my, how I've dabbled. Daddy is captain of industry. That America. But to be a useful person always seemed to me to be particularly hideous. Which is my America. Lazy, lovely, relaxed. Oh, Papa, Papa, you didn't want children. Why? They only come into this world to slaughter you, cannibals. Eat America! Oh, Papa, Papa, Papa. My childhood was perfect. Paradise lost. Now, one is driven forward into the future by the storm sailing out of paradise. But for a fairy princess everything always works out perfectly. And everyone dies on schedule. Beautifully. I've always been lucky. And everyone always loved me. But I'm sure I'll never marry. Much too fat, you know. Unless, I opened an Italian restaurant and I was mama. Mama in the kitchen. Or unless I was a peasant and came with a large dowry. Seven cows, my weight in gold. The rest of you, you're normal. But, oh, dear God... I'm frightened. My kingdom is come. My will is done. I love all of you out there. But you just don't know the burdens of reality. # Sing hallelujah # Angel, angel, down we go # All you got to say is, hey, hey, hey # And a hi ho # I'm all for trying a little flying # To get you high # Sing hallelujah
