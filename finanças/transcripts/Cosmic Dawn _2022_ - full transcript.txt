Why can't we light a fire? So we can see the sky better. Come. Want to look? Nuh-uh. But we came all this way. Don't you want to see the eclipse? I'm cold. I want to go to bed. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Get in. Okay. I will make a fire in the morning. Do you know how much I love you? This much. 'Night, Ro. 'Night, bunny. Ah. Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? What's going on? It's not snow! Isn't it beautiful? Don't be scared, honey. Don't worry. I'll hold on to you. Do you know how much I love you? This much. Don't touch me! Oh, Ro, shh, shh. It's okay. Hey, it's me. I'm here. Uh, yeah. Hey, it's okay, honey. You're okay. Hi. Is she okay? Do you mind if I ask you a question, Aurora? How long have you been using drugs? Since I was a kid. She was in some pretty intense therapy when she was younger. What were you in therapy for? How much time do you have? Her mother, my sister, died when she was a little girl. She didn't die. She disappeared. She was just a little girl, and she was very scared and all alone, and you know how it is with kids. They build up these things. Ro! - Ro, Ro? Please don't. - Get back! - Excuse me. Ro, please don't go. Aurora! And I'm sorry. Ro? Paging Dr. Trudeau. Dr. Greg Trudeau, please report to... Aurora? Aurora? Excuse me. Don't go. Ro. Ro! Hello. Can I help you? Um, did someone just come in here? Besides you? Um, is there a bathroom I could use? Yeah. Over there. Looking for something in particular? No. Just browsing. Maybe I could recommend something. I don't need help. Okay. I'll leave you alone, then. Uh, wait. Hey. No, no. No, no. Don't cry. Aw. We all have bad days. Oh. I'm sorry. This is so embarrassing. I don't judge. Unless you were actually going to buy that. Then, maybe I would've. No. It's pretty stupid. Well, especially that one. It's just a bunch of recycled conspiracy theories. But I have something that you might like. Ah. This. This is something else entirely. "Elyse"? No last name? Is she like Cher? Well, Elyse isn't like anybody. She's a visionary. Is this a joke? Not to me. No. I saw her. She came into the store. Yeah. Elyse has a way of finding people. Thanks. Ooh. "Aurora." I love your name. Cosmic. Yeah. My mom loved the stars, so... I'm Natalie, by the way. All right. Let me know what you think about the book. Yeah, I will. I don't know what you're up to this weekend, but I'm getting together with a bunch of friends if you want to join. Yeah. Maybe. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. - Bye. - Bye. This weekend in London marks the final eclipse of the lunar tetrad. This event is quite rare, having occurred a mere 62 times since the first century. Of course, this has created all sorts of so-called prophecies throughout history. Even the name "blood moon" evokes a sense of doom. There will be wonders in the heavens and signs on the earth. The sun will turn into darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious day when he returns. Perhaps , although I don't think the rapture is scheduled for this weekend. Aurora? Hey, Ro. Blood moon? In class? What are the odds? It must be a sign. Stop following me, Dieter. You've left me no choice. You didn't return my phone calls. She came back. Just like she said she would. - Fuck off and... - You belong with us. You belong with us. Next time I see you, I'm calling the police. We're sorry. You have reached a number that is disconnected or is no longer in service. Hey. You made it. I was beginning to think I wouldn't hear from you. Didn't you say that your friends were going to be here? They are. My friends are dying to meet you. You tell them that I was coming? I told them you might. It turns out I was right. I hope you like karaoke. Yeah. Elyse, this is Aurora. She's the one I was telling you about. Yeah. Hello. And this is Mizuki, our resident bad-ass. Natalie tells us many great things. Oh. Well, we just met, so... Natalie says you read my book. Yeah. And? What did you think? Uh, it was interesting. Whoa. That's a way of saying you didn't like something. No. No, I didn't mean it like that. I've read so many books about UFOs and stuff. But your book was... Your book was like reading about my own experience. Maybe you were. Join us. One, two, three. One, two, three. Testing. Before we get started, I would love to thank Zee for making tonight possible. Zee? Thank you. I'm really happy to be here tonight for this special occasion. Everyone. Thanks, you guys. But the real reason we're here tonight is because of Aurora. Whoa! So, tell us why you're here, Aurora. Uh, Natalie invited me. Go inside. Deep here. I'm sure you know. Know what? That you were not invited, Aurora. You were chosen. Your mother is Iris DeLuce. Abducted, June 8, 1997. It's okay. You moved here after the encounter to live with your aunt Caroline. You were just a girl. How do you know that? Tell her, birdies. December 10, 2011. Japan. February 21, 2008. Canada. Kami, October 27, 2004. Ireland. Dinesh, April 14, 2014. India. Winston, May 27, 2006. Jamaica. Naveed, July 5, 1982. Iran. Solévar, August 22, 2007. Peru. The blood moon brought us here... From all over the world, like a magnetic force. We're witnesses. Just like you. Who wants to share their encounter with Aurora? It's okay. Really. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Sorry. Oh, I just need a bit of air. You know, the first time is really intense. I don't understand. Who is she? When I first met Elyse, she knew everything about my encounter, too. It's a process of discovery and acceptance, but Elyse saved my life, and I really... You know what? Never mind. - What? - No. Nothing. You know what? We're going to do some karaoke. So, come back inside. Wait. No. What were you going to tell me? Elyse has a place up north, and the rest of us are going up this weekend. She wants you to come. Uh... I know. I get it. Too much, too soon. Next time. Well, when are you leaving? You're not going to regret it. But first, karaoke. Hey. Your phone was disconnected. I was worried something happened to you. Can you just let me in, please? So, what have you been up to? Why are you here, Ro? I thought that we could have dinner together, like we used to. That was a long time ago. I saw Dieter. So? So, Dieter also said that Elyse was back, which is obviously insane. No. So is Dieter. I know that you probably don't want to see me, which I totally get, but... No, it's okay. I'm glad you came. Thanks for saying that. God. I just want it to stop. It will. Hello? Hello. I'm here to pick you up. I'll be right down. Hi. Aurora? Hi. I'm Dieter. Where's Natalie? Oh, she's going to meet us there. Do you have everything you need? Okay. Well, we have a long drive, so come on. Hop in. Okay. There you go. Hey. Come. Sit up front. I won't bite. I'm just a pussycat. Come on. It's okay. Nervous? A little. Everyone is at first. It's just that Natalie said she was going to pick me up, so... She's too important for pickups. That's why Elyse sent me. Why does everyone call her Zee? Why is the sky blue? You know, a lot of phonies try to slip by me, but they always reveal themselves. I'm not a phony. That's what everyone says. - Well, I'm not. - Mm-hmm. June 8, 1997. May 4, 1985. Hello? Wake up. We have a long way to go. Come on. Don't forget your suitcase. Let's go. Very, very cold... ...this morning. Where are we going? Don't worry. It's very nice. Come. Come on. Hey, you guys. Ah. There you go. Hi. Welcome. You never said it was so remote. I know. Amazing, right? Wait till you see the place. Come. Hey, it's this way, huh? Careful. Watch your step. Watch for the bears. It's a joke. I wish you would've told me that you weren't going to pick me up. Oh. I thought I did. Why? Did something happen with Dieter? No. It's just a bit intense. Right. He's really just a pussycat once you get to know him. He said the same thing. No, it's true. If he seems protective, it's only because he's been with Elyse the longest. I'll take this to your room. Let me show you around. Where did these all come from? It's a mystery. Elyse had a vision that led her here. She says these heads were probably erected by ancestral witnesses. Wild, huh? And you believe that? Well, why wouldn't I? They can't explain Easter Island, either. Look who's here. Winston was an architect in Kingston, and Kami was in construction when she wasn't kicking ass. They're a crucial part of what we've built out here. Where's the house? It's not a house. We call it the mother ship. Before Elyse remodelled the place it was an old tunnel system, probably dug out with primitive tools. And the renovations were all done to plans she'd laid out in the book. - Hola, Sol. - Hola. Sol ran a flower shop in Iquitos in her former life, and we would be so lost without her. You'll see why. I mean, her plants are out of this world. And this is where we usually meet. Uh, goggles, Dinesh. Dinesh rigged lights on big Bollywood productions in his former life. Oh, wow. And this is where the lessons take place. Full stomach, full mind kind of deal. Lots of protein. Strictly poultry. And that is Elyse's room. The private tutorials happen back there, but only on special occasions. And your room... Is down here. Elyse prepared it especially for you, to help you get used to life out here. I never said I was staying. Oh. Neither did I, at first. Thank you, Naveed. What's with the bow? Well, I'm Nazeena. - Like the warrior princess? - No. With a "Z," not an "X." It means "key." Or "gate," depending on the context. It's in the glossary, which you should memorize. Things will make so much more sense. But you can call me Natalie. I kind of prefer it. Yeah. You must be dying to freshen up. Hmm. My first night here, I had the best sleep of my life. Something about this place just clears your mind. The cleanse helps, too. Cleanse? Mm-hmm. Diet is a critical part of the preparation. For what? They return for those who bear witness... And prepare for their return. You know? Like us. Good morning, birdies. Breakfast will be served shortly in the dining room. Please be on time, okay? And let's make our best effort to make Aurora feel at home. Aurora, this song goes out for you. I'm really glad you're here. Tom? I'm leaving. Huh? On a jet plane? Hey. Aurora? Ro, wait. Hey! Looking good. It's not really my style, but it's sort of comfortable. I know. They're better than pyjamas, right? Here. Aurora, this is my husband, Tom. Hey. Um, could you please make one of your legendary smoothies? She's beginning her cleanse. Lucky you. You know, today, I want to hear a real loud one for Aurora... ...for finding her way. Okay. Thank you. You know, we should all congratulate Zee, whose astral exercises are going very well. - Woo-hoo! - Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Well, to mark this special day, I would love to start with a reading from the Book of Tetrad in the original Reptine. "To the witnesses, it was said..." Thank you, Tom. Okay. Enough. May we reach The Dawn. Okay. Enough preaching. Let's eat. This is not Kool-Aid. You look good, Aurora. That colour is perfect on you. Did you get it all out? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Here. Let me help you. All right. There we go. Sorry. Supposedly, it's supposed to make you more receptive to the signals. But, uh, it's really just mostly kale and cayenne pepper. And hey, hey. It happens to everybody. Sorry. Natalie never told me she had a husband. Yeah? Well, she does, and it's me. So, are you from the city? No. Not originally. I moved out here to be with my aunt after my mom disappeared. What about you? Uh, I'm not really from here. I really just kind of ended up here. Like me. Yeah, I guess. So, what's your aunt's name? Caroline. She know you're here? - No. God, no. - Mm-hmm. She already thinks I'm crazy. Are you? Do I seem like I am? It's too early to tell. Caroline? Ro. - Were you followed? - I don't know. Maybe. Where's your laptop? Over there. Dieter was cruising around the block earlier. You know there's a blood moon this weekend, right? The ability of the human mind to convince itself of just about anything, it never ceases to amaze me. That was her. She probably made that years ago, just to fit her narrative. Okay, honey. Here. It's to protect you. I would, but... So, how do you like it? It's not what I expected. And all from a book. Have you read it? Ooh. Great stuff. Especially the parts about, uh, channelling the star source and interstellar projection. Have you had an encounter? Yeah. Probed, twice. Although the second time was my choice. No, no. It was, uh, Natalie who had the encounter, or so she says. You don't believe her? I believe that she believes she did. Put it that way. If you believe that, then why are you doing here? Well... because I love her. It's in the book. I came by, and you were not here. Uh... Yeah. I was outside. It was so hard, losing her. Wasn't it? Tell me, what did you see that night? You know I was just a kid when it happened. Things get built up in your mind. I'm a good listener. Unlike most people you know, I'm sure. Come. Okay. Mm. Um... We were camping in the woods to see the eclipse. And when I woke up, there was all this light, and my mom was gone. So I followed the light. I was so scared. I just want to see my mom again. And you will. That's why you are here. They talk to us through living things, Aurora. This is where they will return for us. The landing site. Wanted to show it to you personally. How did you know about my mother? Your mother told me. I was sent to find you, Aurora. Hmm. I see you're skeptical. It's not easy to accept. But it's true. What did my mother say? If I tell you, I want you to do something for me first. Jump. You're joking, right? That's up to you. Hmm. Your mother said she loves you... Ro. It's alright. It's alright. It's okay. Hey. Race you back. Okay? Hello? It's me. Hey. You took it. Why? Why didn't you tell me? I was protecting you! Dieter was using me to get to you. He wanted me to show you the video. I said no. You took the bait anyway. She's supposed to be dead! Aurora, that's what they want. It's mind games. Then we need to do something! Yeah. Alright. How are you? Hey, good morning, everyone. How'd you guys sleep last night? Hi. - Hey. - Hey. I had a dream about you last night. A good one, I hope. We were planning to kill somebody. Really? Who? Everyone. You know, today, I woke up, and I felt that it would be so beautiful to start the day singing a song. - Would you like? - Singalong time. - If you want to sing... - Coffee? Go ahead. - Black, like your soul. - If you want to dance, - please let yourself go. - You got it. Go ahead. Cry.

No. Come in. I have something for you. Oh, Tom. Thank you. Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. It's gluten-free, so... That's okay. So, I was looking for you yesterday. I was with Elyse. Oh. Where... where'd you go? We went to this beautiful cliff. Did she ask you to jump? I mean, that's the whole thing, right? She asks you to jump, and then you're supposed to have some kind of special insight? But I didn't jump. No. Nobody does. It... it's a loyalty test. It's about the fear and the trembling, all that stuff. No, but... she knew things about my mother that she couldn't have possibly know. Well, yeah. No. She has that effect on people. What effect? She... gets them to believe that she has special powers, that kind of thing. Maybe there's a reason for that. Because she tells people what they want to hear. Uh... I mean, how much do you really know about her? How much do I really know about you? Well... Zena! Okay. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Natalie! Natalie! - It's okay. She's okay. - What did you do? - Somebody help her! - Shh. - Natalie! - It's okay. It's okay. Hey, what's going on? Fuck off! Fuck off! - Stop it! Stop it! - She's fine! She's fine! - She's fine. - Calm down, please. It's okay. She's fine. She's fine. Come here, my darling. Come on. I'm here. Talk to me. - She's okay. - They are speaking to her. And they are saying... They are watching us. And they are coming back. When Zena unlocks the door. That's okay, my darling) That's okay. That's okay. Calm down. Calm down. It's okay, my love. It's okay, my love. Come here. Come here. I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. You were perfect. Okay. Let's take her in. Please help me. Okay. Let's go. It's perfect, my love. Oh, my sweetheart, it's okay. It's okay. Come on. Not everyone can communicate with them. She has a rare gift. Tell that to Tom. I don't have to. He already knows. Alright. When we get inside, just let me do the talking. Okay. Got it. You ready? Yeah? Hey, Frank. What's she doing here? I don't want her in my house. She's on our side. She wants to help. So, you're telling me you're okay with whatever happens out there. No. I just don't want to be involved. I don't want that part of my life. Okay? What if Natalie were stopped there? She's not! Go on out there. I need your boat. Natalie's 15 in that one. She was such a good girl. Smart. Independently minded. But that was before all the trouble started. And then that witch filled her head with all these... ideas. You want to help your child, but at some point, you got to accept that maybe you're not able to. It's not your fault. I'm going to take a shower. Uh-huh. Are you alright? Yeah. It's just... You're wasting water. - Hey. - Did you talk to her? Frank, I tried. She won't... What did she say? I'm coming out. No. Don't do that. Stay there. It'll only make it worse. - I can handle it. - You're making it worse. - Would you just listen to me? - What? Okay. There's this other woman here. Uh-huh. - Her name is Aurora DeLuce. - Okay. - And she has an aunt named Caroline who lives in the city. Now, I think that if we just could reach out... Tom? What are you doing? Nothing. Who was that? My dad? He's just worried about you. I'm a grown woman, Tom. But you're still his daughter. He loves you. Do you love me? Of course. Then quit living in denial. Nat. Hey, wait. Hey, come on. Hold up a second. Natalie! Listen to me for a second. Just don't tell anyone. Come on. Please. Natalie! How are you? Why is everyone so concerned with how I'm doing? Last night was really intense. They were speaking through me. Sorry if that scared you. Natalie! Natalie. Okay. Look. Tom may seem all cool and cynical. It's all an act. He was with me that night, when I was abducted. You were abducted? Yeah, of course. That's how we met. Tom came back with me. At first, it was exciting. It was our own little secret. But I didn't want to live that way, so... I don't understand. Yeah. My dad didn't, either. He thought I was having some kind of psychotic episode. Everyone did. Until I met Elyse. Aurora! There you are! I was looking for you. Soledad told me your flower blossomed. Hmm. Aurora was just asking me questions about my encounter. And did you answer? I'm pretty sure I did. Right? Well... Tonight, eight o'clock. Bring the flower. Hey. I, uh, I saw you talking to Natalie. What did she say? She's ready for you. Hey, no. I need your help. Please. Thank you, Dieter. Come! Oh, it's beautiful. You know, it does not respond to everyone. I wish everyone had your faith. Like Tom, for example. Despite what he says, Tom is here for a reason, Ro. And it's not because he loves his wife or whatever he told you. It's because deep inside, he knows the truth. And one day, he will reveal that to you. This flower has been used by shamans in the Amazon basin for a millennium. They were the first one to connect the direct link between the Pachamama, Mother Earth, and the cosmos through their experience with plants. It's literally a step of inner vision. Please. I won't lie to you, my bird. It tastes awful. But it worth the effort. Try another one. You will start feeling the vibration almost immediately. Yes. Don't fight it. It's nice. Let it wash over you. Whenever you're ready, open your mind. Let yourself go. Now, come to me, Aurora. Come. Aurora. Aurora? Come. Aurora! Come to me! Aurora! Aurora! Don't worry! It's okay! Don't be afraid! It's time for you to face this night. Don't be scared. Look. Look. Come on. Ready to go. Aurora... I just want to say... You sure you know what you're doing? Goodbye, Frank. Welcome. It's good to see you. Everyone, look who's here. - It was beautiful. - Elyse! Elyse! What's going on? There's someone here. What? There's someone here. Everybody stay inside. Dieter. Yes. Okay. You know the protocols. Go to your rooms. Now. Now! Natalie! Natalie! Natalie, what is going on? Is everything okay? Oh, my God. Ro. Caroline? Natalie. Oh, Jesus. I'm here to take you home. I am home. Ro, what's going on? Do you know anything about this woman? Did she tell you she was in the same ward as Natalie? I was sent to find your daughter. Delusions of grandeur. That's what they call it. Her real name is Rose Alba Salazar. She was a registered nurse in goddamn Guadalajara before she lost her fucking mind. Lies. All of it. I can show you the patients' list from the hospital if you want. It's true, Ro. I've seen it. Come on. Enough is enough. - Come on, honey. - Hey. - Come on. - Hey. No. I'm not going anywhere. Natalie. Natalie, wait. Natalie, please, honey! - Natalie! - Leave us alone. Frank. Fucking crazy bitch. Come on. Natalie! Natalie. Natalie, are you okay? Oh... Did you see that? Yeah. I think you should lie down. It's happening, Ro. It's really happening. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It is so beautiful. Help! - They're speaking. - Help! - What's going on? - Help! - Elyse. - What's going on? Elyse, there's something wrong! Calm down. Let me get her up. Let's go inside. Dieter! Watch out, my birdy. Take care. Okay. She's arriving. - Take her, please... - Where's Tom? To my room. Go. Go. Lay her down, Dieter. I really don't understand. This was not supposed to happen like this. They're coming back soon. Hey, hey, hey. Yes. Why did you turn her father away like that? He wants to put her back in that cage, and she belongs here with me. - She's sick! She needs help! - She is not sick. She's arriving. Hand me the flower, please. Okay. Stop! Elyse says no one leaves! Shh, shh, shh. There's something wrong with Natalie. I know. Frank and Caroline are waiting. Come on. Police are on their way. We have to go now. Left her with that monster. Someone's coming. Shh. - Where's Tom? - Shh, shh. Down. Tonight at 6:43pm, in a moment of divine revelation, Natalie arrived at the hour of her dawn. Her father won't understand, but Tom does. Despite his betrayal. And his betrayal will bring him back to me, and in doing so... I will be killed. But have faith, because I will return... On the fourth moon of our lunar... Our cosmic dawn. So, now, I leave you with a reading from the book of Penumbra. No, no, no, no. Aurora! Mizuki! Mizuki! Aurora! Stop! On parting, I say to you... No! No! May we reach the dawn. No! Be okay. Be okay. Be okay. Somebody help! Oh. Natalie. Natalie! You, you killed her. Stop. Natalie. I was wrong about one thing, Tom. Natalie was never the Zena. Put it down, you slimy fuck. Put it down, Dieter. It's okay. Go. Natalie? Nat? Sweetie. She's not gone. She reached... Ah! Where are they? They are waiting for you. I knew you would come. No, no. This can't be real. It was always you. I just didn't realize it at first. Sorry. It was the only way. No, no. No. No. Th... this is a dream. The world is full of illusions, Ro. But the dawn is real. You are the one they chose. Hello? Honey? Honey? Ro, honey? Ro, honey? Mom? Mom? I see you. Do you know how much I love you?
