(mystical music) (siren blaring in distance) (bluesy rock music) - What can I get you? - You might not remember me. Riley Parra, we met-- - Oh, wait, you're the detective. You found the guy that killed Sheila. Most cops don't come down to No Man's Land. - Yeah. - A night shift bartender gets killed during a robbery. Who cares, right? You got justice for her and that means a lot to people around here. So this is on the house. - Thanks, but I'm not here to drink. - Mm, suit yourself. - This is Sheila's diary. The lawyers needed it for evidence and the trial is over so the DA agreed to give it back. I thought maybe you could make sure it got back to her family. - Actually, her sister called about that. They make detectives go around returning evidence? - No, it could have taken months going through the official channels. I thought maybe we could cut through the red tape. - I'm sure they'll appreciate it. So, when are you off duty? - Not on duty now. - Mm, wow, you really do go all out for your cases. I'm off in 45 if you wanna stick around. - I could be persuaded. - We could start with that drink. (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) (laughing evilly) - Hi, Riley! (Riley moaning) - Oh, sorry. (melancholy piano music) - Oh, sorry. I love your ink. - Yeah, it was a drunken mistake. - I forgot. Your phone, it's been beeping. - Oh, it's probably police business. I, need to-- - Mm, it's totally fine. Maybe I'll see you around? Right. (telephone ringing) - [Kara] Hope you weren't pulled away from anyone. - Hey, your text said we had a case? - [Kara] Yep. Sending you the location now. - I'll be there in 15. (siren blaring) - You look like hell. - What are you doing on duty? I thought you left when I did. - I decided I'd get some overtime. - We used to pull OT together. It's starting to feel like you're avoiding me. - What do you mean? I just called you. - Yeah, the past few weeks you've been changing shifts, riding separately. Did I piss you off? - No. Look, I'm sorry, I just, family stuff. You know how it is. - Not really. So, body? - Right, the body. It's right over there. A homeless guy's dog found it. I do not understand homeless people with dogs. - People give you more when you have a dog. Plus, it's protection around here. Good thing the dog was around. - Well, Dr. Hunt already pulled the body out of the box. - Dr. Hunt, we have another new ME? - Yeah, turnover rate for that job is pretty high. - Alright, I'm gonna go check it out. See what else you can find. - Okay. (dog barking) - Thank you very much. - Dr. Hunt? - Oh, God no, Dr. Hunt is my mom. Hi, call me Gillian. - Hi. Your mother's a doctor, too? - No. - Uh, you're fucking with me, aren't you? - Mm-hmm. I work with dead bodies for a living. I gotta get my kicks where I can. - I'm Detective Parra. - Oh, so you're the one who owes me a half hour of beauty sleep. - You can spare it. - For the record, you did just say that out loud. - Yeah, I know. Um, so, body was moved, stuffed in a box. Are we thinking knives? - No, it's way too large. Honestly, to me, it looks like somebody took a machete and cut out a slice of his back. - Gang bangers with machetes? - [Gillian] Machetes and down pillows. - Oh, is that gang-speak for-- - (laughs) No, I found this next to the body. - You think it's a clue? - No. - You're fucking with me again. Let me know if you find anything else. - Okay. Oh, for the record, you just tripped a little. - I know. (Kara snickering) Any witnesses? - You really think anyone's gonna talk to us? - It's worth asking. We should see if there's any cameras around here. - I'll check out the cameras and call. If anyone can get them to talk it's you. You're not a cop, you're their old friend and neighbor. - I never had any neighbors! Any friends I had down here they went away a long time ago. (tense music) (woman chattering) - He had a sword and sliced him up! Like that, sliced him up! - [Riley] Hey! - Oh, hey. So there is a working camera. It's not great but we can look at it together in the office. They're sending me the footage. You have any luck? - Talked to some of the homeless, not much help. But one lady said she saw three men around here. One of them had a sword. Yeah, I hope there's more luck with your video. - Let's go see if Dr. Hunt found anything. - [Riley] Gillian! - Oh, first name basis? Yeah, Gillian said she found something odd. - Oh, I love odd! - I don't think you're gonna love this. Um, okay, so the victim was a middle-aged, white male with no visible wounds aside from the obvious ones on his back. - That's not so odd. - I'm getting to it. I took a closer look to see if I could narrow down what kind of weapon was used and I noticed this. These muscles were completely severed from his back. - Still not that odd. - I have no idea what they are. Humans don't have muscles like that, not there. I mean, this is like a second set of pecs. - So he was deformed? - Well, either that or he was rockin' a pair of wings, which, granted, would go a long way towards explaining the feather I found next to the body. - What? Is she being serious? - She's fucking with us. - And she catches on very fast. Yes, unfortunately, he was very badly deformed. Now, the good news for us is that means there have to be medical records that could point us toward an ID. Oh, I also took a picture of the guy's face; no visible marks or scars. (whooshing) - Hey, what's up? - I think I've seen this man before. - Where? - I think four years ago he, he saved my life. (dramatic music) (dramatic piano music) - I was on night patrol in No Man's Land. Still in uniform. Nobody wanted the shift so I took it. So one night I saw these two guys fighting in an alley. I went to break it up and I chased this guy up to a roof. Well, he got the drop on me and he threw me off. - He what? - I know how it sounds, which is why I never told anyone. But I remember flying through the air thinking this is it. And then I woke up on the sidewalk. I don't remember landing. I don't remember any pain. I had blood on my uniform, you know, but. I was disoriented and I look across the street and I saw this man just watching me, smiling. And then when I blinked he was gone. - And, our John Doe, that's the guy? - It's him or his twin brother. - Geez. - You know how it is patrolling No Man's Land. We've been trained to keep our eyes up front and ignore any kind of weird crap that we see. - Oh, speaking of ignoring. - And what are we ignoring, ladies? - Whatcha got? - (laughs) I heard you got the waterfront victim. Have any updates yet? - Dr. Hunt is performing the autopsy. We're downloading the video footage. We'll know more in a few hours. - Oh, right. Can you close it quickly, huh? Because Gail Finney is doing another series of articles about how this department is wasting resources and money. And, call me crazy, but I don't need you wasting too much time on a transient. (Riley muttering) - Hey, hey, hey. You should relax around her. She doesn't think that you're dirty just because your first partner was. - [Riley] I can't tell if she'd consider me being dirty to be a pro or con. Until I figure that out I'm just gonna keep my distance. - Oh, come on, piece of junk. - You should just get a new one. - Yeah, like the department will shell out that kind of money. Okay, got it. That's our victim. - Yeah. What about the other guy? I can hardly see him. (screen bleeping) What just happened? - I don't know. This is what they sent. - Let's go check the video logs. - I'll go, you should go canvass. - Or we could just go together. - No, it'll be faster if we split up. - I'm starting to think you're avoiding me on purpose. - Okay, we could go together and talk about your crush on Dr. Hunt. - What? What are you talking about? - Oh, please, you're Miss Calm and Cool most of the time, but around her you trip all over yourself, literally. - I don't. - It's so cute! - I don't. I'd have to be insane to date someone from work. - Yeah, sure. - Okay. But I'm expecting a phone call when you find that extra video. - [Kara] Yes, alright. (alarm chirping) - [Samael] Excuse me, sorry. - I'm in a bit of a hurry. You can talk to anyone in there if you're making a report. - But I need to speak with you, Riley. - Do I know you? - No. My name is Samael, we've never met, but we have a mutual friend, Ridwan. - Sorry, I think I'd remember a name like that. - You wouldn't be alive if it weren't for him. Your medical examiner retrieved his body this morning. - What do you know about that? - I suppose you don't want to discuss this here? - Yeah, okay. I know a place we can go. (tense music) The dead's man's name is Ridwan? - I want to tell you everything, but, um... (clearing throat) There are some things you need to know first. What do you know about Marchosias? - Marchosias? Uh, the boogey man from No Man's Land. People have been talking about him since I was a kid. He runs things down there from drugs to prostitution, you name it. But, um, he's a myth, he's an urban legend. - Oh, uh, he exists. He is a demon and he is as real as you or I. - Demon? Sure. I guess if you're trying to stop him that would make you an angel. - Precisely. - (laughs) Well, okay. You know, I've worked crazier things in No Man's Land. But, um, alright, angels, demons, I'm on board. You're an angel. That Ridwan guy is an angel, too, I guess. - Mm-hmm. What do you remember about your first partner? - Chelsea Stanton? Good cop, turned crooked, she's in jail now. - Not your first partner on the force. Christine Lee. - Oh. She caught me stealing. She gave me a lecture instead of a criminal record. She made sure I went to school. She's the reason why I wanted to become a cop. - She made you the protector of No Man's Land. - Yeah, I guess. That's why I've kept coming down here even when the others won't. I wanna make her proud. - Again, you misunderstand me. She physically marked you. - My tattoo? - It's more than just a tattoo, Riley. Did she ever tell you what it means? - She said it marked me as a champion. She believed in me. She thought I could help people. What does any of this got to do with the guy in the box? - Everything. An ancient war between good and evil is being waged in this city. Throughout history the angels and demons have chosen human champions to fight for them. Christine Lee was a champion for heaven and she chose you to be her successor. - Oh, my God, you think I'm Buffy. - Buffy? Oh. (chuckles) I suppose that is an apt comparison. Throughout history the champions of good and evil have fought one another on behalf of their respective sides. Good fought for truth and hope. Evil poisoned people's minds to fear and foster disillusionment. - Yeah, it's like Samantha B. and Fox News. - Then five years ago Christine Lee died. You were not informed of your responsibility so Ridwan and Marchosias chose to pause the battle. - Well. I gotta tell you, peacetime doesn't look so hot. - Uh, hmm, people were allowed to choose their own path. Even still, some of them chose the darker route. - Yeah, I've heard enough. - I swear to you all of this is true. - Oh no, I get it. Angels, demons, I believe it's real. I just don't want any part of it. - When you were a teenager you ran away from home because you could no longer bear your father's friends coming into your room at night. (thudding) - Watch your mouth! - Your tattoo is protection, Riley. But it also marks you. It is your duty to help those like you to save those who are praying to be saved. How can you turn your back to that? - Do you know who killed Ridwan? - I do. (tense music) He was meeting with Marchosias last night on the waterfront. They got into an argument and Marchosias killed him. - Why? - You have to ask why a demon would kill an angel? - Why me? - Because without even knowing you were a champion you stood again the darkness. Even though there was darkness in you. - So you guys want me because I'm a bad girl? - No, because you've seen evil. With a few different choices you could have been a champion for evil. You had to do whatever was necessary to survive on the streets of No Man's Land. I think in order to fight the forces of evil one must have one foot in hell. - As far as I'm concerned, that truce can keep going. I'll keep doing what I do and you and your demons can leave me the hell alone. - Okay. (whooshing) - What the hell? - Ridwan's wings were cut from his body. We form our bodies to walk on this plane of existence. When we no longer need them we leave the husks behind. (melancholy music) Ridwan wore this body for 10 years. He and other angels would come to try and help those who want help but, there's only so much they can do. - And I'm just a cop. - You could be so much more, Riley. Do you really want to make a difference in No Man's Land more than getting closure just one case at a time? This is how you achieve it. Think about my offer, Detective. The soul of this entire city is at stake. (dramatic music) - Oh, my God! You just scared the crap out of me. I didn't think anybody was down here who could, you know, breathe. - I'm sorry, I should have said something. - It's okay. Are you okay? - Yes. - Really? 'Cause you look a little, I'm gonna go with goofy. - Goofy? - It's a medical term. I studied very hard in doctor school. What's going on? - Uh, it's this case, it's taken some really odd turns. - Well, I thought you loved odd? - I do, but there's a limit. You said the victim was middle-aged, right? - I did. - [Riley] Can you tell me how old exactly? - I can't. Unfortunately, there was a mix-up when I sent the tests in to the lab. I don't know what happened. Everything else came up clear, but somehow the skeletal maturity results got mixed up with a 5th grader. - Meaning? - They say the guy is 10 years old. Obviously, I'm going to have them run it again. Or, you know, maybe the guy was 10 years old and he just looked really bad for his age because No Man's Land is notoriously tough on kids. You're sure you're okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - Alright. Well, if you do need somebody to talk to, then my church has a couple law enforcement groups. - Yeah, I'm not so much the church type. You know, hellfire, brimstone, snakes, apples. - I am. - Really? - No. No, for me it's just a place where I can talk with people. I can talk about my experiences and they understand them. Or, I'm always here if you need an ear. (tender music) - So, uh, for the record, you're touching me. - I know. - Well, thanks for the offer to listen, but I don't want to bother you. - Are you kidding me? I'm stuck down here all day with these guys. Don't tell 'em I said so, but they suck at conversation. They're a bunch of stiffs. (laughs) - Probably hard to get a word in, huh? - You have no idea. They're like, ooh, look at me, I'm all dead and stuff! (chuckles) - Yeah, I'm gonna get out of your hair. Next time I come down I promise I'll wear a bell. - Or you could just say hi. It's probably a little more fashionable. (thudding) (tense music) - Hey, it's me, something's come up, I couldn't canvass. Let me know about the videotape. Maybe we can watch it together, maybe grab some lunch. I'm sick and tired of how things have been between us. Maybe it's in my head, maybe it's something I said. So whatever it is, we'll figure it out, okay? Call me. - Hello, Detective. Making progress? - Working on it. - Well, no point in burning the midnight oil on it. - You telling me to drop the case? - No, of course not, uh-uh. Just these stories all end the same. If it's not drugs, it's someone panhandling on the wrong corner. You do realize there are other cases that deserve your attention. - It's No Man's Land, right, who cares? - Harsh. But there's truth in it, I'll give you that. Look, Riley, the deal is there are a lot of bad things happening in this city and I would just much prefer if you and Kara were working on something worthy of your skills. - Right. - You got 24 hours; you don't get a lead, you move on. - One day, that's all they're worth? - That's all we can afford. It is what it is. - We're gonna find a lead! - [Hathaway] Watch your mouth, detective! (groaning) (cell phone ringing) - Screening your calls now, Kara? - Uh, I got your message about lunch. That's, uh, you don't have to do that. - Oh, come on, I've had a really strange day. I could do with some sweet Kara time. - Really, it's okay. - You sound odd. What's going on? - Nothing's going on. Look, there's no more video footage, so... This case, it's probably not gonna go anywhere, right? - Did someone tell you to drop the case? - What? No. - You can't lie to me, Kara. This has been a really strange day. Let's just meet up and talk about it, okay? - Okay. Meet me at the park. - Okay, spit it out. You sounded spooked on the phone. Does this have anything to do with how weird you've been lately? - No. Yes, sort of, it's complicated. Look, Riley, we have to drop the case. - No, we don't. - Why is it so important to you? It's just some guy. A dozen more just like him died in No Man's Land last night. - This is the one we caught. What happened, exactly, who spoke to you? - It was, he was waiting at my car. He was just there. He told me to drop the case. - I guess if Samael wants me to find Ridwan's killer it makes sense that the other side would try and stop us. - What did you just say? - Never mind, it's a long story. How did you get rid of him? - Who, the guy? - Yeah, how did you get-- (dramatic music) You agreed. - I'm sorry, Riley. I am. But he offered me money. My niece is sick. My sister can't afford to pay for her treatments anymore. I've been killing myself trying to find a way to help out. - You could have come to me. - No, not for something this big. There was no one I could turn to. And now this guy comes out of nowhere. He's offering me enough money to make every probably they have go away. All I have to do is drop the case. - This is how it starts, Kara. The first time it makes sense to look the other way. The second time, well, it's easy 'cause you've already done it once. And again and again until the only thing you do is lookin' for the next payday! - I'm not a bad cop, Riley, you know that! - You just took a payoff to drop the case, Kara! Come on, we're going back to the station. We'll figure this out. - No, no, we're not going anywhere until you agree to drop the case. I'm not giving the money back. - Okay, holster your weapon, Detective. - No, I'm saving my niece! We can just pretend that we hit a dead end, okay? Let's just pretend! - What you gonna do, shoot me, Kara? - [Kara] If I have to. - What would your niece say if she saw you like this? What was her name? (grunting) (gun firing) (dramatic music) Oh, no, Kara! Is she? - I'm sorry. (melancholy music) Riley, she died on the way to the hospital. - We were following a lead on the transient from No Man's Land. Someone said that Marchosias was-- - Marchosias? Did you just say Marchosias? Marchosias is a myth! - Don't say that! We were following a lead to No Man's Land. We were following through on a tip! And as soon as we got out of the car we got shot at! And Kara was caught in the crossfire! And I shot her! I shot her! - Listen to me. There's gonna be an investigation, but it should be open and shut, for now. Take some time off. - I can't. I have to go back. Please. - You're compromised, Riley. And you just lost your partner. I know how close you and Kara were. No! Go home, look at me. Take care of yourself, please. Hey. Call me if you need anything. Oh, my God. - I just lied to save my job. Still think I'm a good cop? - Things haven't worked out quite the way we had hoped. - Who was it, huh? The prick who got to Kara? What demonic asshole put her in that position? - No one of consequence, a random. - They went after her family. - That's what these demons do. They thrive on good people making bad choices. The compromise Kara made burned off a small piece of her soul and the demons grew stronger because of it. Things like this happen all the time. - I should have just dropped the case. At least Kara would still be alive. - But that's not who you are. - There is no justice here, not for Ridwan! I'm not gonna file a report that says the devil did it! - You are a champion. You weren't chosen because you were special. You are special because you were chosen. You do not have to adhere to the laws of man to bring justice to Marchosias. - So I just go and perform a demonectomy in No Man's Land? And suddenly overnight the whole town just turns into paradise? - Not for everyone. Perhaps for a few people, the ones that you manage to help. And then they affect others and so on and so on. You have to see the larger picture. - It's bigger picture, and I see it just fine. But right now I'm tired and I'm sad and I want to go home. (tense music) - [Riley] Hi. - Hi. I just wanted to say that I heard what happened and if you need anything at all please don't hesitate to ask. - Thanks. Actually. I think I could really use a ride. - Okay. - Maybe you could take me to your church? - Yeah. Yeah. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. - No. I'm sorry. I've just had a lot of people jump out at me lately. - Well, uh, given your line of work I'm glad you aren't armed. You reached for your weapon even though it's not on your hip. - Good eye. - It's my job to read people and I'm reading that you are not very comfortable. I'm Father Jacob. - Riley. - How can I help you, Riley? - I don't know. I've never really been to church. - Never? - Father issues. - Ah, well, one can only preach to the converted so many times. It's nice to have a challenge now and again. (church bell dinging) - Do you think that there are angels and demons in the world? - Ooh. Well, when You send me a challenge You go all out, don't you? Angels and demons? Yes, I believe such creatures exist. But do I think they walk amongst us interfering with the affairs of mortals? No. I think they have much better things to do with their time. But I do believe that our actions can be colored by the good and evil forces that exist in the world. When we're faced with them, then we can only focus on the better angels of our nature to make the right choice and fight them off. - Fight them off, how? With weapons? - Not the kind you're thinking of, probably; holy water, relics, sacred objects. It's the basis for the myth of vampires being repelled by crucifixes. But for those items to work you have to believe in them. You have to have faith in whatever you wield. Otherwise it would just be a lump of wood. - I lost someone. I was supposed to fight back but it just seemed so pointless. - Can you live with knowing that you could have done more but chose not to? - What if it kills me? - That's your choice. Is it worse to die for a cause or live with not trying? - I don't know how to answer that. (sighing) - You're the only one who can. I wish you luck with whatever you're facing and I'm sorry for your loss. I'll pray for you if you like. - Pray for her. It couldn't hurt, right? Her name was Kara. - It never hurts. Whatever your answers are I hope you find them. - The crucifix, the holy water, the whole sanctuary thing, does it really work? Can you really repel a demon with all these things if you believe in them? - Yes. Yes, I believe that the holy water cleanses me and that a cross necklace can defend me against the evils of this world, because it represents my relationship with God. If you don't have that faith then that is just wood and this is just a building. Find what you have your faith in. (hopeful music) - I gotta get this money! Gotta get this money! (crowd chattering) (yelling) - Yo, Skaggs! What'd I tell you about gambling in my city, huh? - Harassment! You know what that means, Parra? It means that I'm gonna sue you, the department, the city and anyone else I can think of when I get out of jail tom-- (yelling) Okay, they're gone, you could lighten up a little! (grunting) - Gotta make it look real. - So what're you looking for today, RP? - I need some information on Marchosias. - Oh, Marchosias! (laughs) I got a lot on Marchosias. He lives on the lake in Scotland. No, wait, he lives in the Pacific Northwest and he has really big feet. - I have reason to believe he's real. - No way. No one that big and powerful would need to hide. - That's what they said about Heisenberg. Maybe pretending to be a myth is how he stays big and powerful. - You know Walter White is literally a fictional character, right? You're not doing your case any favors. - Usual fee for whatever you can tell me about Marchosias. - Okay. (laughs) I'm not saying he's real, but going on the stories they tell, Marchosias is the guy above everybody else in the city. Everybody reports to him. Drugs trickle down, money flows up and Marchosias is on top of the hill. - So I go to the bank and ask when the local drug lord makes his usual drop off? Come on! - Go to 5th and Jefferson, you might wait for a little while, but someone will show up to pick up today's take. And they may take you to a higher up. And then that person may take you to Marchosias. Maybe even take you to see Santa Claus. But, if I were looking for the boogey man, that's where I would start. - Okay. Thanks. - Sure. - I'll check it out. - Hey, where's your partner at? - Kara? She's gone. She was killed in the line of duty yesterday. - Shit! Wait, you think Marchosias has something to do with this? Take your money, this one's free. For sweet Kara. She was one of the good ones. - Thanks. She really liked you a lot, too. (tense music) - Whoever did this to her, make sure you get 'em, alright? - I will. You know, there's one more thing you could do for me. But you gotta keep it quiet. Anyone catches you, you could go to jail. - For sure. (suspenseful music) - This is a very bad idea, Riley. - Jesus! Don't do that! - This is dangerous. This is their home. - So you can confirm this is Mr. Demon's headquarters? - Yeah. - It's a little too on point, don't you think? (chuckles) - Because your eyes have been opened you can see the building for what it truly is. Everyone else just sees a regular house. Now, listen to me. Your tattoo prevents them from attacking you directly, but it will not stop them from defending their home. - Is Marchosias in there? - He is. - Then I'm going in. (dramatic music) (ominous music) (voices echoing) - You shouldn't be here. - So people keep telling me. - This is not how the war works, (speaking foreign language). You don't come after me. We have our own champion for you to play with. So go on, run and play. - People say you're a myth. (laughs) - What is a man without his legend? What are you doing here? Risking your life to take a stand? - I plan to make you pay for what you did to Kara. - Well, that might be interesting to watch. But, unfortunately, I am not interested. Au revoir. - You don't get to decide that! - Watch your tone. I assure you, I had nothing to do with Kara Sweet's death. - And Ridwan? - I met with him occasionally to discuss our truce. You interrupted one of our meetings. I am sure you recall how that went for you? - Why did you end it? After all this time, why start the war up again? - I didn't. When Ridwan and I met, as I recall, we agreed to let you mortals decide your own path. And you would be amazed to see how many of you opt for darkness without any of our interference. The dark is growing, Detective. We haven't had to work for it at all. I wouldn't end the war. I have been winning without working for it. (dramatic music) (whooshing) - Gonna have to work for it, now. - What do you intend to do? Arrest me, put me on trial? - You have people working for you, that's how I found you. Dealers, lieutenants, figureheads who get their hands dirty in No Man's Land so you can stay hidden. I take out enough of them, maybe I can cut down on the influence you have in No Man's Land. - Perhaps. But one thing is certain, you have been made aware of us. And you have made it clear you won't be content to sit on the sidelines. The truce is over! I will allow you to leave this building, but not without a reminder of what you're up against. - Is that a threat? - Consider it a reminder. (grunting) (thudding) (whooshing) (growling) No! (Riley groaning) I didn't have to call them off. This time I won't. - I'm gonna take you down. If not as a cop, then as a champion. (laughs) - It will be interesting. Good day, Detective. (Riley grunting) (panting) - Gillian? I need you. I need a ride. (Riley moaning and gasping) I'm sorry about your t-shirt. - [Gillian] I give no shits about the shirt. - I'm sorry I bugged you after hours. - I'm glad you did. - I'm usually a much better date. - What, are you kidding me? This is crazy sexy. Okay, I'm gonna have to lift your t-shirt off of the wound. It's gonna hurt. - Okay, whatever you gotta do. Just get it over with. - Jesus Christ. - What? - Look at this. This looked so much worse when I picked you up and now it doesn't even look like you need stitches. - Maybe I heal fast? - Nobody heals this fast. - Maybe there are special rules for when a demon hurts a champion. Like what I was telling you in the car. Do you think I'm insane? - No. - Are you fucking with me because-- - No. Alright, I'm gonna tell you something that I don't tell anybody because, frankly, I'm afraid it'll get me kicked out of the medical profession, but, uh... When I was 19 I had a girlfriend and she asked me to go mountain climbing. I was young, I was very stupid and I fell. Both for the girl and off the damn mountain. And as I was falling I felt this hand pull me back up. And ever since then I believe in angels. Having lived in this city for a little bit it's not much of a stretch to believe in demons, too. But, mostly I just believe you. (tender music) - Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Am I the first patient you've ever kissed? (laughs) - Yes. Wait, you mean like on the mouth, or-- - You're so odd! - Word on the street is you like odd. - I do. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you going somewhere? - I gotta go back. - Wait. You're going back to where you got hurt? - I have to find out the truth. Who killed Ridwan, scared Kara. I think I figured out how the pieces fit together but I gotta double check the video footage. And I have to see somebody's reaction when I spill it all out. - You don't even have a gun, forensics took yours. - I have a backup gun. I'll be safe, I promise. I have to. I have someone who counts on me coming back in one piece. - Be careful. Just because you healed crazy fast last night there's no guarantee that it's gonna happen again. - I'll be careful. (upbeat guitar music) - Just like you asked. Did you really track down Marchosias? - It wasn't easy, but I was motivated. - You okay? You look different. - I got stabbed yesterday. - You wear it well. - I owe you for this. - To Kara. - To Kara. (glasses clinking) - Tell me later what happened? - If you see me again it will have gone well. I'm getting better at telling when you're around. So you gonna have my back this time or you gonna hide outside like you did yesterday? - I will follow you. - I warned you about coming back here. - I have an insurance policy this time. - The angel? - No, I didn't actually think he'd come in with me. I just wanna talk. - Very well. I cannot promise you safe passage out. (speaking foreign language) (voices whispering and echoing) Neutral ground. I mean, sort of. Last time we were together it didn't work out very well for you. - No, it didn't. I'm here about the murder of the angel, Ridwan, and the bribe of Kara Sweet. - Oh, do you want me to confess? - I want you to listen to my theory. It's hard to find a good witness in No Man's Land. But one lady saw three people at that meeting that night. Video footage shows two. - And which one was I? - The two of you were meeting. Just like that meeting I stumbled on when you threw me off the roof. That's what the video footage showed. But just before it went dark, you both turned. Someone else crashed that meeting as well. Someone who didn't like the idea of the truce. - A demon? - See, I got a front row seat in how demons operate. They use their claws, teeth. But Ridwan's wings were excised with an extremely clean cut. It was someone with a weapon, like a sword. But demons don't carry swords. (ominous music) Angels do. - What in heaven's name are you doing? - You set this whole thing up to get me here in front of Marchosias. You told me the truth and when I didn't jump at the chance to sign up, you went to Kara. You bribed her to drop the case. You knew exactly how this was gonna play out, didn't you? I wouldn't save the world so you put me in a position to avenge Kara. - Oh! (laughs) Now, this is fun! - Hey, Marc, what was the arrangement you had with Ridwan? - The war would be on hold as long as you remained ignorant. Instead of pitting our champions against each other, we'd occasionally work things out over coffee and danishes; very diplomatic, dreadfully dull. Nothing like this so, please continue! (chuckling) - You wanted the war to start up again. - We were handing the demons victory after victory in battles we could have won. A fight you could have won had you only known. I needed to put things right. - By killing another angel? - Riley, Ridwan had used his divinity to bring you back to life. He was practically mortal. What I did to him was merciful. - Maybe it seems that way for a fallen angel. - I am not fallen. - Maybe not completely, but you're certainly tripping. - You did all this, killed Ridwan, pushed Kara to the edge. Why? - I've watched you, Riley. We've never had a champion like you. If we didn't take advantage of you we might never have a better chance of ending this war. Look, if that means that I've fallen, if it has cost me my divinity, so be it. - It's gonna cost you a lot more than that, Sam. Put your hands on top of your head. - Are you serious, is she serious? Are you going to arrest an angel? - There's more than just bullets in this gun. As your champion I don't think holy relics are important; crosses, holy water. They're all based on the faith you put in them. So I had to ask myself, what do I believe in? In the law, my badge. So I had someone melt it down and every bullet is coated in the metal of it. - I like her, I like her a lot! (gun firing) (grunting) (whooshing) For what just happened, you get a pass from me. (laughs) You never planned to arrest him, did you? You were always going to kill him with those bullets. - This was the only way I was gonna get him. - Oh, he won't last long. The moment he murdered his kin, he began to fall. He will leave his shell somewhere, get recalled, get sent to my neck of the woods. And that's where the real fun begins. - And no one's gonna be held accountable for Kara? No one's gonna pay for Ridwan? - Oh, he'll pay, but he'll also get what he wanted. You're aware of the war, so the truce is over. The game iS on Detective Parra and I look forward to watching you fight, if you can get out in the next few minutes. (dramatic music) (hissing) (bird cawing) (wings flapping) (Riley gasping) (light music) (laughs) - Okay, you need bread, you need eggs, you need milk. Basically, any kind of actual, you know, food. - [Riley] I have food. - You have ketchup and something I think might have been an apple once. - I'm not that bad. Besides, I don't really do breakfast, just coffee, maybe toast. - Excuse me. Ah, there we go. - You didn't have to stay the night. - I wanted to. Is that okay with you? - That's very okay. - Good. - I thought you said I didn't have anything? - You didn't, I had to call downstairs for reinforcements. Luckily, that store delivers. - Really? - Oh, my God! How long have you lived here? - Long enough to be embarrassed I don't know that. - Well, if you're gonna fight the bad guys you're gonna need a better breakfast. - Excuse me. - [Gail] In a city where the police don't seem to care. - Oh, my God. - Have you noticed that? - Gail Finney, you actually listen to this crap? Why, she's not even a journalist, she's an instigator. - Yeah, I think they call themselves commentators. - I don't care, all she does is badmouth the police department. I mean, somehow she makes you guys seem like both racist, violent monsters and do-nothing slugs. Now how those two aren't mutually exclusive, I don't know but I don't wanna meet her to ask. - She's not completely wrong about some of the stuff in the department. And, you know, I don't like her either, but she has a following and it helps to know what garbage she's saying in case one of her followers hurls it back at us on the street. - Oh, my God, she just chaps my ass! - [Gail] But it sure feels that way, doesn't it? (chuckles) - You didn't have to turn her off, but thank you for turning her off. - She has a column in the papers, too. I can read it when I get back to work. So, do you need a ride? I can drop you off at home so your walk of shame isn't too long. - (laughs) Thank you. So, hey, what happens next? - Oh, um... You know, I don't know, I mean I really like being with you. No one's ever stayed long enough to cook breakfast. Do you wanna talk about being exclusive? I've never done this before, but... What? - Um, actually I was talking about the whole angels versus demons champion for good thing. - Oh, yeah! (stammering) I knew that. - You a little flustered Riley Parra? - What? No, no, no. Anyway, you know the whole angels and demon thing I guess it's up to them. I think I'm supposed to fight someone, but I don't know who yet, so I'm just gonna go do my job. - Do you think they're gonna have some kind of signal, you know, that they flash when they need you, like, up in the sky? - Well, they're up there, so maybe. - Well, if they don't offer one you should totally ask for one. - What would my signal be? - I don't know, uh, a spoon? - No. - Bowl? - No. - Mug? - Now you're just saying shit from my apartment. (laughs) - Bagel? - No Man's Land, no one likes to go there, especially the police, apparently. Average call time for a 911 call is 47 minutes. That's shameful, absolutely shameful! The boundaries are clear, listeners. If you get robbed on the wrong side of the street, well then, you'd better start praying because the cops aren't going to help you. Our taxes are not going towards a police force. They're going towards a private security firm protecting rich elites. Who, by the way, can find every loophole imaginable to stop them from paying taxes! (siren blaring) - Good morning, detective. There's somebody I'd like you to meet. - Riley Parra, Caitlin Priest. I've heard a lot about you. (giggles) - From who? - Oh, uh, all over. Your reputation precedes you. - That can't be good. - I'm looking forward to working with you. - Okay. (laughs) Well, good luck to you two. I expect good work! - I'm excited to get going, get workin' with ya! - Are you a morning person? - Uh, I don't know. Why do you ask? - You seem oddly peppy. That's Kara's. (dramatic music) Never mind. - So, the most recent-- - [Hathaway] Parra! - Thank God. Yes? - There's a body at 14th and Pierce. I want you and Priest to take it. - Right inside No Man's Land. Come on, Priest, you're jumping into the fire. First thing, I drive, no exceptions, unless I've broken both my arms and legs and even then, ask first. - Got it. (ominous music) (camera clicking) - Alright, bagged and labeled. - Take it to Mike in the lab? - Take it to Mike in the lab. - Hey, you look familiar. - No, I just have one of those faces. Hi, you must be Detective Priest. I'm-- - Gillian Hunt, the medical examiner, yes, I know! It is wonderful to meet you. - Can't. But, you know me? - Yeah, uh, I did a full inventory of the entire department staff and memorized everyone's name and position. - Priest, why don't you check on the perimeter? - Isn't that what the officers are doing? - Double check. - Right, right, okay. - So your new partner is certainly-- - Cheerful. - I was gonna go for like a hummingbird on crack landed in a vat of espresso, but sure, yours works, too. - She's a cartoon character. Anything unique? - No, why mess with the classics? We got a gunshot wound to the chest. Bled out over here. I would say he's been dead for approximately three hours, but I can narrow that down and I wanted to wait for you to see if he had a wallet. And, Yahtzee. - Did you just say Yahtzee? - Be nice, I made you breakfast. - Let's see who we got here. Vincent Morris. Oh, shit! - What, what's wrong? - Sussex Apartments, that Morris. - [Gillian] Oh, shit! - Yep, one of those elites Gail Finney was talking about just got killed in No Man's Land. (ominous music) Muse, it's Riley, call me back. I need info about anything happening on 14th and Pierce, specifically last night, but anything newsworthy in the past week or so. Usual rate, okay? Call me. What you got? - No witnesses. There's a bodega at the end of the street with a security camera, but the owner said it's a dummy. - We have bigger problems than that. Kid in there lived in Midtown. - Why does his address matter? - Rich kid gets killed in No Man's Land? Papers are gonna have a field day. - True. No less a tragedy, though. Can I finish what I was saying? So, that street ends up in a dead end, which means the victim and his killer must have come form that direction. Now, there's a stoplight just around the corner so the bodega might have dummy cameras, but I'm pretty sure the traffic camera works. - Good catch. Better not be smiling again! - No, wouldn't dream of it, Detective. - Detectives, how'd the canvassing go? Did you find any witnesses? - You know what I like about you, Dr. Hunt? - Hmm? - Your eternal optimism. - I do try. Can't hurt to ask. - Okay, uniforms found the car parked down the block. We may have caught the killer on camera, still checking with traffic. I was hoping you had more luck. - I confirmed blood loss as the cause of death. Gunshot wound to the chest, no exit wound. And, as far as his clothing, he was wearing something I like to call poor chic, meaning he spent a lot of money trying to make it look like he was wearing cheap clothes. - I think that's called shabby chic. - And he also had track marks on the inside of both arms and inside all of his fingers and toes. Now, I didn't find any paraphernalia on the actual body, but I think it's safe to assume what he was doing in No Man's Land last night. - Are you trying to do my job, Dr. Hunt? - Hell, yeah. If I solve the case you get off early. You can take a lady out to dinner, for God's sake. - Nice strategy. - Oh, this is cute. - What? - Your banter, you guys are really cute together. - How did you, um? - I just, you know, the connection. I can just see, I'm very into it. Human females, or women, we-- - Would you like to get coffee? - I would. - Why don't you go check with traffic? - Mm-hmm. Have a nice afternoon, Dr. Hunt. - See ya. So, you know, you could maybe lighten up with her a little bit. You don't want her crying great big cartoon tears. I'm just sayin'. - We work together. We don't have to be friends. - No, you don't have to be friends, but you do have to be partners. You could bond. Okay, this thing that we have might be a little bit too new for me to offer you life advice, but apparently I'm going to anyway. I think that you have spent a lot of time alone and you should maybe let somebody in, besides me. Then maybe start with the woman that you're gonna spend 60 to 70 hours a week with. - Oh, so tell her I'm the champion of good and that I fight for the angels against demons? - Yeah. No, just tell her what she needs to know. - She smiles all the time! - I know, and it is incredibly unnerving. But look at it this way; she is more than likely gonna get involved anyway and you can't do this alone. - I don't have to do anything alone. I got you. - You are so trying to distract me from my point. - Is it working? - A little but, yeah. But, she is your partner and you need all the help you can get. Think about it. - I will. When do I get my blood test? - Tomorrow. - See you then. Before then would be very nice, too. - I think so, too. (thudding) (laughs) - Hey, I'm sorry if I overstepped in there. - It's fine, I didn't think people could tell. (laughs) - Oh, you're serious. Yeah, you get a little like, (laughs) you know, flirty, around her. - We need to track down Vince Morris's family, notify them of his death. - Of course. Hey, can I drive? - Nope. - Okay. (knocking) - Blimey, you scared the be-Jesus out of me! - Are you free? - Do I look free? - There was a murder last night. Victor Morris. You might recognize his last name. - What the fuck do I care about some trust fund kid? - He was killed in No Man's Land. (dramatic music) - Oh! Police on the scene? - Of course. - Oh, that is good. Well, at least they're investigating a crime in No Man's Land. But it's a rich kid. I wonder how many poor victims they stepped over to get to him. - I thought you'd want to know in time for tomorrow's show. - I do, thank you. So, this is solid, right? Same source? - It's authentic. - Excellent. - I'll leave you to it. - Oi, what's the name of the lead detective investigating? - Parra, her name is Riley Parra. (dramatic music) - Can I help you, Miss? - Detectives Parra and Priest. We're here to see Rudolph and Constance Morris. - Are they expecting you? - No. - Then you'll have to call back and make an appointment. (laughs) - You can't be serious? - Our residents here expect a certain level of privacy. We can't have police officers traipsing around like some kind of private military. - Ah, you're a Gail Finney fan. Well, their son, Vincent Morris, was the victim of a crime, sir. I'm here to tell them that their son is dead. - I'm sorry to hear that, but you can leave a card and I'll have them call you at their earliest convenience. - Their son is dead! Did you hear me? - Unless you have a warrant or an appointment you're not getting in. - That's unbelievable! - Well, is there anything else? - No, you may go back to guarding the gates. - Have a wonderful afternoon. (tense music) - [Riley] Where did you disappear to? - [Caitlyn] I was checking the perimeter. So, there's a service entrance just around the side of the building near the dumpsters. Judging from the cigarette butts scattered around I'd say someone likes to spend their breaks out there. - [Riley] Good catch. - See? Clearly, someone takes their smoke breaks here. - Yeah, I don't wanna break in just yet. But if this jackass won't let us in we might not have a choice. (cell phone ringing) This is Detective Parra. Mr. Morris, yes, I'd like to-- Yes, your son, he was-- The morgue? You can identify the body in the morning. The medical exam-- He was shot, Mr. Morr-- Hello? Son of a bitch! - I assume he wasn't overly despondent? - I guess he's been waiting for that call for a while. Let's go. (switch clicking) (speaking foreign language) - Oh! Rude. - Got five seconds to start walking, Marc. - Come on, I'm not here to hurt you, Detective. And actually, the opposite. I came here to offer my assistance. - Yeah, I think I'll pass on making a literal deal with the devil. - Oh, it's just one murder. You can close it and move on to more important things. Get Gail Finney out of the department's back before she can dig her claws in. - Gail Finney? Never heard of her. - I thought we were past the point of lying to one another. (gun clicking) You can get on to more things, not as mundane as human police business. - Again, a literal deal with the devil! - A devil, there is a difference. - Take your bunny and get out. (sighing) (singing in foreign language) What's with the bunny? Oh, great. (suspenseful music) (knocking) - Hey. - Hey. - Come in. - Thanks. - You ride? - Yeah! - You're a medical examiner! - So what, that means I can't be a badass? - No, it's just odd. - Well, I think we established that odd is most definitely my lane. - Well, you keep surprising me, Dr. Hunt. - [Gillian] Good. - I ordered some food. - Well, you keep surprising me, too. - Come on, let's eat. - Okay. (soft guitar music) Okay, so then what seemed like the longest years of my entire life I finally finished residency. And then I realized I'd barely set foot outside of Georgia. So I had to find a place that needed me. - Oh, and so you chose the most crime-filled and corrupt city in the country. Sure, Dr. Hunt! - Yeah, well, I have job security and never a dull day. - You have a point! - What about you? You never thought about leaving? - When I was a kid I didn't have a choice and when I grew older cops were ignoring No Man's Land. So I figured if I didn't do it, who would? What? - You do realize you are the perfect champion for good, right? - Oh yeah, I'm the bad girl of No Man's Land. - Beware demons and fallen angels. - Do you like bad girls, Dr. Hunt? - Apparently, I do. - Oh, yeah. - Mm-hmm, yeah. - Yeah, you do. - Mm-hmm, yeah. Oh, yeah. - [Gillian] What does it feel like? - Stings a little bit when you touch it. But otherwise I don't feel it. - Does it make you feel powerful? - No, it doesn't make me stronger. It just protects me from the demons. - Does it hurt when you get close to them? You know, like Harry Potter's scar? (laughs) - A Harry Potter reference, Dr. Hunt. - What? I'm telling you, a lot of adults enjoy YA novels. I mean, I'm not saying me. Okay, I'm totally saying me. - No, it doesn't do that. It just prevents me from getting hurt. - But you did get hurt. - That's because I went on their turf, then all bets are off. - Does it bother you to talk about this? 'Cause I don't have to ask you so many questions. - No. It's just I don't have that many answers. And it does help to talk to someone about it. Even if it's just to keep me from going crazy. - Well, that's yet another reason to play nice with Caitlyn Priest. - Oh, oh, no, there is something off about her. I just feel like she's keeping something from me. - Do you think she's dangerous? - No. - I mean, you just met her. - True. It's just, it's hard. I keep thinking about Kara. - I get it. It's gotta be hard. - I'll make more of an effort with her. - Good. Now, I'm going to get ready for bed. - What you got in that bag there? - Oh, uh, necessities; clothes for tomorrow, deodorant. Shit, did I forget a toothbrush? - You can leave some of it here if you want. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, what if you actually do forget your toothbrush one night? I mean, I get creeped out if somebody uses mine. - Well, for that reason alone, clearly. Okay. Oh, incidentally, how do you feel about sharing a razor? (laughs) - [Gail] Well, folks, we finally figured out what it takes for the police to investigate a murder in No Man's Land. You have to be rich. Last night a young man from City Center was murdered. And, I'm guessing, how long did it take the police to get there? I'm betting the gun was still smoking. Mind you, that's still no guarantee that they'll actually catch the killer. (tense music) - Have you read the paper this morning? - I listened to her on the way in. I assume the print version's pretty much the same. - Well, there is one important difference. The newspaper mentions you by name. (dramatic music) - Great. - You were the perfect detective to be on this case. She can't claim you don't care. - She's not completely off base, LT. Some of the cops here-- - The faster this case is closed the less time she'll have to dig her claws in. So what do you have? - Priest and I contacted the family yesterday. Apparently, their little boy was a big problem, lots of arrests. The father didn't seem surprised. And I've got the blood tests back so pretty soon I'll know exactly what he was shooting up with. Priest is looking into traffic cam to see if our killer was photogenic and I've got my usual feelers out. - Where is Priest? - How would I know? - Well, find her and get to work. - Aye, aye, LT. (telephone ringing) Muse, talk to me. - Hey, RP, I got your guy, Holiday. - Where is he? - He's working at a bar off of MLK and Pierce. - I know it. - Now, he's new to the city, just got in from New Orleans. - Thank you! Hey. - Where you going? - While you were sleeping in my informant got back to me. Gonna have a conversation with a suspect at the bar where he works. - A conversation? Can I come? - Might get violent. Are you prepared for that? - I can manage. - Hey, did you finally hear back from your people in traffic? - Yeah, that's where I was. They're a little slow to return emails so I went down there in person. They'll have the files to us later today. - Okay. (ominous music) Seth Holiday? Damn it! No, you wait here! (dramatic music) Shit. - Hi. - Hey there. - Didn't think I'd see you here again. - Yeah, I wasn't really planning on it. You okay? - So far. - Hey, Seth, let's not make this a whole lot worse. Let her go. - Fuck you both, stay back! - Can't let you walk out of here, Seth. - I didn't do nothing wrong! - I believe you. Let's talk about it. - Y'all are just gonna frame me, you crooked cops! - No! That's not how I work. - If I stab this lady you're gonna have to help her. - You really don't wanna do that, Seth. - Then let me go! - Riley! (whooshing) - Put the knife down. (mystical music) You're not a killer. What you're feeling right now is stress, frustration. You feel persecuted. - Anytime something goes wrong they come after me. - I know, but this time it will be different. You can trust us. Let Wilma go. - I really did want Riley to call me back. - I didn't do it. - We know. Let us have her. (knife clattering) You made the right choice, Seth. Now I'm gonna to you to the police station. - Okay, yeah. - I don't see any cuts. How are you? - I've had a gun held to my head, but never a knife to my neck. - Always something new in No Man's Land. Listen, I feel partially responsible. I can take you to the hospital if you-- - No, I'm good. I feel very peaceful, oddly enough. I don't know why. - What do you remember? - He let me go and you pulled me out. Where did he go? - My partner took him. - You have a partner? Thank you for saving my life. - Oh. - You want a shot? - Uh, no, thank you. Still on duty. - Mm, right. Well, it was great seeing you. - You too. - And hey, don't be a stranger. - [Riley] Yeah. - Louisiana misses you, Holiday. Lots of people looking for you. They were sure glad to hear where you ended up. - Hey. What the hell happened back there? - You don't remember? - I remember the other cop. But nothing else. - Yeah, she talked some sense into you. It gives me hope. Makes me think that you are the cooperative kind. Vincent Morris. Did you know him? - I don't know, maybe. (banging) - Not good enough. - I deal with a lot of customers after dark. It's hard to see their faces. And I don't really try, you know? Most people don't want their drug dealer to recognize them. - Alright, you work around 14th and Pierce, yes? Were you there the night before last? - Yeah, until about midnight. - And what did you see? - Nothing! I swear, if I knew something I would tell you, but I must have left before the guy got killed. - You left at midnight. What time did you get there? - A little after nine. - Where did you go after you left? - My girlfriend's place. - We're gonna need her to confirm that. - Whatever. I didn't kill him. I swear! - You know what? You can swear as much as you like. All I care about is if you can prove it. - I really just wanna know what the hell happened back there. - You and me both, buddy. - Okay. - I haven't been here very long. - I'd love to show you around, help you get to know the city. - Everybody out! - Okay, well, see you around. (dramatic music) - Alright, angel, start talking. Who are you? I know it's not Caitlyn Priest. - In a way, I am. I created this person to inhabit to interact with you in human form. This body will age, it will bleed. Caitlyn Priest is as real as you are. - Yeah, but it's not who you really are. - I am called Xerashel. - Oh, geez! - It was never my intention to deceive you. Given your experience with Samael I figured it was easiest to ease you into the truth. - Lying to me is not the way to gain my trust. - There is no right answer. I needed to be in your life. You have no idea of the difficulties ahead. You will need my help. - Why would I trust you? - Because I have known you for your entire life, from the moment you were born. - What do you mean? (somber music) - I am not just an angel. I'm your guardian angel. (sighing) - You're my guardian angel? You expect me to believe I had a guardian angel with all the shit that happened to me? Where the hell were you my entire fucking childhood? You just let it all happen? - There is only so much that we can do! We cannot always intervene. - So you just sat back? - I made sure you survived. And when there were things that I couldn't prevent I was there in the aftermath. In the embrace of a friend. A kind word, the hope to help you take the next step. The medical examiner who picked you up when you couldn't walk any further. (tender music) - Gillian? - You were always destined to meet her. I just made sure it was now, when you so desperately needed her. - So, um... What was all that back at the bar? - I used my divinity to nudge him in the right direction. He didn't want to hurt her. I pushed through his fear and his stress and I spoke to his soul. - I thought you said you were human? - I'm in a human body, but I'm still a heavenly being. It has its perks. - It's gonna take some time to process all that. - Of course. - Once this case is over we're gonna have a conversation about this. - I wouldn't expect anything less. - Hey. I remember something. - Shocking. - Yeah, I remember that guy. Sold to him around 10:30. Remember because that sub shop on the corner was just getting ready to close and I had to run over there and get my six inch. - We can confirm that with them. - Do it. I got the turkey with extra tomatoes. And they'll remember me 'cause I pissed them off. I like my tomatoes sliced real thin. - Let's go check that out. - What's wrong? - The body was found at eight in the morning. Gillian said it'd been there for three hours. If he left at 10:30-- - He must have come back at some point. - Yeah, well, what would a kid from the Sussex Apartments be doing down there if he already got the stash for the night? - Maybe he went back for another score? - That's unlikely. Were you able to get the footage from the traffic cam? - Yeah, traffic sent it over, I just need to download it. - Okay, go get it. I think we're looking for only one car, the victim's. - Do you think he drove there with the killer? - No. I need to look at Vincent Morris's arrest records. - Detectives, I hope you have an invitation with you this time or at least a warrant. - No, we're here to talk to you. - Well, unfortunately I have a job to do. - Yes, you do. You've been working here for 16 years. Now that's dedication to, what, signing for packages? Keeping the riff raff out? - The people in this building pay top dollar for security and peace of mind. - Must have been rough when Vince was brought back by the cops on six occasions in two years. Doesn't look good in the building newsletter. - Vince Morris was a hooligan. His parents would stick him in rehab for a month and then he'd be back. - And back to his tricks. I bet you every single time he showed up stoned it killed you to let him into the building. - He didn't belong in this building! - So what happened that night, huh? He shows up high as a kite. You have to let him in. You had enough. - I'm going to ask you politely to leave. - We're just getting to the good stuff. Traffic cam footage shows you in Vince Morris's car. One right next to the crime scene. We didn't find any blood in the passenger seat, but I assume you knocked him out, drove him across town and then shot him. (dramatic music) Damn it! (whooshing) - Perimeter is clear. - Detective Parra. (clapping) You managed to tackle and arrest an innocent old man who was just going about his business. Nice one. - I recognize that voice. Gail Finney. Careful, you're dancing on the edge of slander. - Oh, come on now, detective. We're both women of action, champions of our cause. - Let's save some time, Miss Finney. A blanket no comment for the rest of my career. - Don't be so quick to judge. You might fall on hard times one day. Need a rumor that needs corroborating. My reach is extensive. My column is one of the most read in the city. - Yeah, you're a legend, in your own mind. - I don't know you. Are you new? - I'm-- - If you want a comment-- - Oh, no, no, no. (dramatic music) I don't need a comment. - I'm not afraid of you, Miss Finney. You're nothing but a snake that hides behind a microphone and peddles in lies and fear. - Feel free to call my show anytime. I love hearing from my listeners. (sinister music) - That woman reeks of demons. - Like she's possessed? - No, I mean, I can just feel them around her, but no, she's human. She just spends a lot of time around demons. Do you know her? - No. She seems to know me. She mentioned me in her column the other day. You think she works for Marchosias? - I think she's their champion. - You think? You don't know who their champion is? - Not until they reveal themselves like you did. - Well, then we need to figure this out because if I can punch her that would be a bonus. - [Gillian] Hey. - Well, hello, doctor. You do make scrubs look very sexy. (laughs) - I know you're lying, but I like it. I wanted to see if you wanted to grab dinner. - Ah, I gotta finish this arrest report. Um, I can see you somewhere in half hour, though. - Good. You make paperwork look sexy. - Um, I know you're lying, but I like it. - I'll see you later tonight. - Mm-hmm. - You're a, yeah you are. I wasn't aware you two were an item. - Well, it's a relatively new development. - I see. Well, Detective, today you caught Vincent Morris's killer. Good job. - Priest actually did the takedown. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Huh, well, not only did you close the case you took the wind out of Gail Finney's sails. So whatever she wrote now will just be petty whining. - Well, I do what I can. - Yeah, you do. And I like it. Well done. Goodnight ladies. - Did she have a weird vibe? I feel like she had a very weird vibe. - Yeah, she keeps congratulating me on closing the case. Gail Finney's really getting to her. It's like she's obsessed. - Well, maybe she's got a crush on her. There's a lot of that going around. - Well. - I'll see you later tonight. - Yeah. - Whoo! - Wait, there is someone I'd like you to meet. - Okay. - Gillian, there's someone I want to introduce you to. - Oh, we've met. - You've met Caitlyn Priest, but she's also a, she's uh, she's my, she's-- - I'm an angel. - Say what now? - I'm an angel. Well, technically, I'm an earthly avatar for the angelic being, Xerashel, but sorry, simplicity's sake, I'm an angel. - Actually, my guardian angel. - Uh, it's so nice to meet you. (laughs) Actually, I'm sorry, do angels shake hands? I don't know. Did I actually just ask that question? - It is nice to meet you. - Do you wanna have dinner with us? I don't, do angels eat? I mean, I know you have, I'm still holding your hand. I know you have a food cake named after you. I'm a big fan, by the way, but-- - Yeah, no, I do eat dinner. Thank you for the offer, but I will pass this time. Oh, I was just-- - Oh, I was-- - Great to meet you. - Raincheck? - [Caitlyn] Yes, definitely. - Are you flustered? (laughs) Are you a little? - Okay, uh, after that revelation I'm gonna go have a stiff drink. And then how about I make you dinner and then bring it over? - That's perfect. - 8:30? - Mm-hmm. (laughs) (dramatic orchestral music) (static fuzzing)
