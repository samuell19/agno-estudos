[ Gunshots ] [ War cries ] [ Gunshots ] [ Speaking apache language ] [ War cries ] [ Speaking apache language ] [ Gunshots ] Orders from Washington, gentlemen. We're not to cross the border. And so he crossed the little river into Mexico and escaped me. "Abiit, excessit, evasit, erupit," which I'm sure you all remember from your Cicero. I translate it to mean, "he has gone, departed, slunk off, and gotten clean away." [ Laughter ] Most of the Cheyenne, the sioux, blackfeet, have all been pacified. Even most of the apaches are quiet here on the reservations where I put them. Indeed, I have even enlisted some of them to act as scouts with our forces. So there remains but one Indian enemy -- war eagle. And here he sits, below the border, secure in his fortress, his naturalfortress of the Sierra madres, waiting, gathering strength, drawing to him all the hotheads, the broncos, the renegades. But one day he will come out, again cross that little river, and I shall have a second chance at him. Perhaps at that time some of you gentlemen may be serving with me, and thus be a part of bringing the wars, the Indian wars, to a final conclusion, once and for all time. Gentlemen, I thank you for your kind attention, and for the pleasure of this brief visit with you here at west point. Good day, gentlemen. [ Applause ] Whoa! Here you got to get out, lieutenant. Lieutenant hazard? That's right. We're your escort to fort delivery. Cranshaw, catch up the lieutenant's bag for him. How many miles to fort delivery? Just a little piece across the desert, sir. I said how many miles! Cranshaw: 90, sir. Soldier: Hey, Indian! Where do you think you're going? He's on orders from fort bayard. He's a scout. I ain't takin' no Indians in my wagon. What's your name? Kroger, sir. Sergeant, you pick up his bag and put it in the wagon. I ain't got no orders to take no Indian. You do now. All right, put it in. No -- youput it in. Yes, sir. Guess you killed a few settlers in your day, eh, Indian? Stole a lot of horses? We ain't ever seen no apache scouts before. I been out here six months, and he's the first injun I've laid eyes on. Well, you're gonna be seeing a lot more of them. General quait's recruiting everyone he can get. For what? Ain't no apaches out here -- not since war eagle jumped the reservation. [ Gunshot ] Whoa! Lt. Hazard: Who's in command at the fort? First lieutenant mainwaring. Just a little bit under strength, sir -- only got one troop. Lieutenant... Private cranshaw will show you to the commanding officer. Hiyah! Lieutenant hazard reporting to commanding officer. Yes, sir. Lieutenant mainwaring? Yeah? Lieutenant hazard reporting, sir. Come in. My orders. Throw them on my desk. Sit down, sit down. I've been sitting for the past three days, sir. No, thank you. Yeah, it is a trip, ain't it? Here, have a drink. Thank you. Fresh from the point, huh? How's the brain factory doin'? It's still there. How'd you finish? Cadet captain. Top man, huh? We're honored. I'm only acting commander here, you know, until, uh, the new C.O., major Prescott, arrives. That's what I heard. What else did you hear? That it's the most exposed outpost in the Arizona territory, that its function is to keep surveillance over the apaches, and that if it's needed, they'll be apprehended and taken back to their reservations. You come to US well briefed, Mr. Hazard. Thanks to general quait. You know quait? I've read everything he's ever written about the Indian campaigns -- everything. There's a few details the general failed to mention -- army red tape, for instance. I requisitioned new mounts for the troops about two months ago, so I sit here and wait. Now they order me to go to fort bayard for them in the morning. Who'll be in command? Captain gray, the medic. I'm handing you the troop command so he can have his time for administration. Yes, sir. The point -- what I mean, Mr. Hazard, is all they give you in those books are glory stuff. They don't tell you about the two things in this country that are practically impossible to find -- one's promotion... The other's an apache. What is he doing here?! He came with me. He's from fort bayard. What'll I do with him? Do with him? I could put him up in the stables. Why the stable? What else? He's an Indian. Good idea, corporal. Put him in the stable. Mr. Hazard, you'll wanna get cleaned up. Cranshaw! Show the lieutenant his quarters. Yes, sir. This way, sir. Didn't stop in Kentucky on the way out here, did you, lieutenant? No. Why? That's where I'm from -- Lancaster, Kentucky. Me and Daniel Boone. Well! You must be Mr. Hazard. Captain gray, sir. Our medical officer. Welcome to the fort. Of course, I, uh, I use the term loosely. Yes, I can see that. No patrols, no eyes or ears. We sit like a blind toad in the desert waiting to get stepped on. But welcome. Que hombre. Muy macho. Sure ain't no $2 hotel room like they got in St. Louis. It'll do. Guess I'd better mosey over to the quartermaster and get some clean blankets and a fresh mattress. Get me some hot water so I can wash up. Anything you want, sir... Except a transfer. Woman: Welcome to fort delivery. I'm kitty mainwaring, Mr. Hazard. Mrs. Mainwaring. I'm lending you the only potted geranium this side of Santa fe. Just a gentle reminder that life can exist in this godforsaken place. It's very beautiful. You'll be doing me a favor by watering it. Did Teddy tell you I'm going home for a visit to Washington, D.C.? He didn't mention it. Well, he thought it would be a convenient time while he's off at bayard for the remounts. Heaven pity the poor post -- officers' quarters will be womanless. Are you the only one? It's one too many, if you ask me. You know, maybe I've gone crazy, but you know the first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to civilization? I'm gonna get into a hot tub with a bucket of ice and a big bottle of champagne. Champagne? Take me with you, Mrs. Mainwaring. Kitty. It's like being marooned on a dead planet here -- no formalities, huh? Make it "Matt," then. I'd almost forgotten how dismal this room was. These were our quarters, Teddy's and mine, when we first came out here two years ago... Or was it 200? It must be difficult for a woman out here -- the heat... The loneliness... The danger. Danger? What danger? A little danger might be a relief from the boredom. The days would be long for a lady. And the nights. But then the trumpeter blows the trumpet and it starts all over again. How is it you didn't bring, uh, yourlady fair to share our purgatory? I had none to bring. Oh? Well... She'll never know what she missed. 'Bye, Matt. Have a good trip, kitty. Doggone, I wish I'd brought along a picture of my Annie. It sure helps when you're homesick. It does and it doesn't. I wish there was some way to cut regulation and bring her out here. It sure would make things more tolerable. She could even sleep with me... Just like at home. You can't bring your wife until you're a three-striper. Wife, sir? I ain't got none. You can't take your girlfriend into the barracks, either! But Annie, she ain't no humangirl. She's the best ol' bluetick coonhound in kentuck. Oh. Excuse me, sir. I'll get your shaving water. Uh, don't hurry. Don't hurry. There's your first duty, Mr. Hazard. Take a detail tomorrow to pine bluffs and cut a couple of loads of logs. Sergeant, my wife is planning to leave tomorrow. You'll have a detail ready for her? Yes, sir. Lt. Hazard: Good luck at Ford bayard. All right, let's go. Kroger! Hook up those wagons. Load the rest of that wood, and make it fast. I wanna be at the fort by sunup tomorrow. Are we driving all night? That's correct. All right, you heard the lieutenant! Get the horses! Hitch 'em up! [ Gasping ] [ War cries ] [ Gunshots ] Let's get out of here! [ Gunshots ] [ War cries ] What happened? We were ambushed crossing the river. The driver and the outrider were both killed. One detail returning! Well, sergeant? The Indians attacked while we was chopping wood. We was mighty nigh unarmed, but we made a good stand. Where's lieutenant hazard? Why, I -- I don't rightly know. We was fightin' hand-to-hand toward the last -- outnumbered 100 to one. You're a damn liar, kroger! War eagle's only sending a few small bands across the border. All right. Dismissed. [ Thunder crashes ] This ought to be dry enough. Matt! Oh, I beg your pardon. I-I'm sorry. Where are you? Here. Well, you certainly know how to take care of a woman. Well, I haven't had too much practice lately. I guess we've both been pretty much on our own. Matt... Will we get back to the fort? "Â¿Quien sabe?", as the Mexicans would say. Who knows? Does that worry you? No. I feel as if i'm... I'm suspended in time. Not a part of the fort or anything, except... Except? Except you. It's a strange feeling. We may never have another time. I know. It's here and it's gone. And then it's rainey blowing reveille, and the ages roll by... And I'm doing the breakfast dishes. We'll get back to the fort, Matt... Because you're too capable for US not to. Good night, Matt. I'm awfully glad it's not goodbye. Sergeant fry, do you know where that pine bluff is? Yes. Search the east side of the area and see if you can find lieutenant hazard or any of the men. Yes, sir. The vehicle was shot up by Indians. Mrs. Mainwaring was the only survivor. Three men lost at the wagon, huh? Yeah. How many at pine bluff? I counted three -- two died like soldiers, one was shot in the back. Nearly everybody panicked. Yeah, I know. Sergeant kroger came back with a story that out-custered custer. My report is not going to be a pleasant one, sir. Don't spare the whip, Mr. Hazard. Let 'em know in Washington the stripe of recruit they're sending US. There's nothing the matter with the recruits, sir. The matter is with the training and the discipline, and I promise you, sir, I will correct that! They won't even understand your kind of academy talk. Then I'll translate it to theirkind. You get nothing but black marks for the condition of those barracks! Your indifference to sanitary regulations is incredible! [ Laughter ] Swallow that tobacco, mister. All right, maybe you'll sabethis! You're not soldiers, you're pigs! You've forgotten you're in the army. Well, I'm gonna make you know it. Every man will wash their barrack -- inside and out. You'll clean your own blankets, and that goes for sergeants, too. Do you hear me, kroger? Yes, sir. Now get this, every man of you. Any further disregard for authority... Will get you double duty. I advise you don't risk it. Normal duty's gonna be tough enough. We're gonna be starting from the ground up... With basic training to combat conditioning. Take over, sergeant. Yes, sir. Arms upward, reach! To the toes, bend. Come on, touch those toes! All the way down! If you can touch your fingers, touch your palms! Mount up! Come on, swing into it! Swing into it! Dismount! Mount up! Let's go -- swing into it! Let's go -- swing into it! Dismount! Forward, double time, march! To the rear... March! Fall out and mount up! All right, on the double! Come on! On the gallop, ho! Left about, ho! Company, halt! I saw you today. You'll kill those men, driving them like that. On the contrary, it will save their lives one day. [ Clears throat ] What did you do to the place? I feel like I'm back among the living. Oh, it's just some calico dress fabric. [ Chuckles ] It's not very military, but it is pretty. Besides, it's all I had. You shouldn't Rob from your wardrobe. Oh, I don't care, as long as youdon't think I look too dreary. Old army squaw, huh? Don't try and spoil me with flattery. Is that how you gathered that bouquet of daisies? I was doing some dusting. I couldn't help seeing them. Gone, but, uh... Not forgotten. The general's niece gets the preferred treatment, huh? That's right. But it's as I told you -- no ulterior motives. Don't touch me, Matt. Don't touch you? Don't start any fires. We're back on our west point prayer rugs, where we reverently recite duty, honor, and country. Yes, we're back. Where you're in love with another girl, and where I've got a husband. Matt, we're back on schedule. The trumpet will blow on time. Nothing has changed but the place. I haven't. You haven't. I know. That's the danger. All: One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Look at him. He's had 'em at it since sunup. I wish this was his neck. I'd wring it and I'd wring it until his tongue hung out like a necktie. Poor, little muchacho. Yeah. Poor, little muchacho. You're gonna miss your tamales tonight, honeybean. One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two... Sgt. Fry: Detail, halt! About face! Simulate load! Dismissed! Look. Hey, look! Seeley Jones! All right, girls, let's get ready to go to work. They get paid today, we'll take it away from them tonight. [ Giggling ] [ Cheering ] Hey! Hey! How are you doing? Take it easy, you bums! These girls are young and tender chickens, and they ain't never been plucked. [ Laughter ] Women and whiskey. The men will visit that hog ranch on wheels for four nights running. On the morning of the fifth day, seeley will depart for greener pastures, taking with him every last dollar in the troop, and leaving me with a sick report as fat as his bankroll. How does he manage it with the apaches around? A tarantula has eight legs, and Jones has twice as many. He's got a foot in every dirty business in the territory -- guns, girls, whiskey, stolen horses... And even claims for the poor, put-upon apaches. How does he get away with it? Influence in Washington, I've been told. And after all your hard work. Are those your wagons? Yeah, they're mine. Then get 'em out of here. Now, just who might you be? Lieutenant hazard, and that's an order. That's an order? Ha ha ha! You look like some pukey youngun fresh out of west point. Pardon me. Ha ha ha ha ha! Hi, captain. Hey, where's my friend mainwaring? He usually comes out to meet me. He's detained at fort bayard, waiting for remounts. That's too bad. I brought him something to cut the dust out of his throat. You the actin' C.O.? I am. Well, I'll just give it to you. It's good stuff. I drink it myself. No, thanks. Sir, I request that you declare those wagons off-limits. Off-limits? Son, out there in them wagons I got anything you need for body or spirit -- got some girls, got a little whiskey. I'll even read you a little scripture. What's the matter with you? You a plaster Saint or something? Ain't you never learned the advantages of good whiskey and bad women? Ha ha ha ha ha! Easy, Mr. Hazard. It's a question of legality. Mr. Jones' wagons are on the reservation beyond our control, and our men have accumulated more time of leave than they'll ever be able to use. Mr. Jones is free to keep his wagons outsidethe gate until he wishes to depart of his own accord. Yes, sir. Good day, Mr. Jones... And don't you ever come through that gate again. This here's the army they sent out to protect me from the apaches? That's a deal! You keep your brass buttons inside this gate and we'll get along. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! [ Playing fast-tempo music ] [ Laughing and cheering ] âª Into the center âª bow to your partner âª Circle to the right Hey, seeley! The pupsnappers have all placed their bets. I've got $180 in the kit. Good. All right, all right. Attention, please! Quiet, quiet! Let's get ready for the prairie sweepstakes! All right, bring 'em in! Jockos, get your mounts. Get 'em along the starting line. Ready! On your Mark...Get set... Go! Come on! Spread 'em out there! Come on! Burning while Rome fiddles? Well, congratulations, son! As captain of the winning team, you are about to be rewarded with the grand prize! What's it gonna be this time, seeley? You're gonna get your fortune told in the fun wagon! [ Sarcastically ] Palm readin' or tea leaves? You been livin' under a rock, soldier? Did you ever get bad pickin's from seeley Jones? Listen, when I tell you that that one in there makes Venus de Milo look like a boiled owl, I curse my poverty of description. Well, that's different! Ha ha ha ha ha! Get 'er, soldier! [ Woman screaming ] Soldier: I ain't never been so gypped since Horace greeley sent me west! Hey, seeley! He wants to know when the balloons goes up, and I don't take them insults layin' down! Let there be no further violence where love should be. Fiddlers! Make merry! And what does my gallant, young joy-killer propose to do about it? That's not funny. If I were an enlisted man, I'd be out there with them. You know, it's ironic -- an armed fort surrendering to a single platoon of females. 1,000 Indians couldn't do that job better. Why don't you just blow seeley Jones' head off? I might... Accidentally blow his head off. Soldier: Some hooker stole my wallet! [ Women screaming ] This is the target. When I give the signal, fire at it -- over my head. Hey, seeley! Yeah? Hey, little boy blue wants to surrender. Why don't you introduce him to French Rosie? Somebody want me? I guess they're having some kind of a drill this morning. Those bums get up pretty early, don't they? Get your liquor wagon out of here. You're on the gunnery range. Gunnery range? Look, mister, I put you over the barrel yesterday with my legal rights. You want me to do it again? Ha ha ha ha ha! Fire! [ Screaming ] Why, you miserable, yellow-legged shavetail, what do you think you're doing?! Come back here! I'll read the law to you! Down ten. Fire! Grab your hats and get out of here! [ Screaming ] Get goin'! Get goin'! Hiyah! Hiyah! I hope you kept it legal, Mr. Hazard. Dismiss the detail. Sgt. Fry: Detail dismissed! I did, sir. As you can see, the wagons were on the gunnery range, and Mr. Jones is leaving of his own accord. You say you got a bottle hid around here? Yes, right here. Well, well, look who's here. Shavetail's favorite Indian, Joe dummy. Yeah, Joe, where you been -- out sniffin' for tracks? Well, that's your, uh, medicine bag, ain't it, Joe? What's the matter, can't you talk? You really think this medicine bag can save your soul from hell? Ha ha ha ha ha! Attention! Damn you, shavetail! What did you say? I said, "damn you, shavetail." You're busted to a private. Report to me tomorrow for company punishment. I'll see you in hell first! Take him to the guardhouse! Yes, sir. [ Knock on door ] Matt! What happened out there? I hit a noncommissioned officer. Oh, Matt! I told you, you were driving those troopers too hard. Troopers? They don't know what the word means. They will by the time I get through with them. You're a hard man... A duty man. That's your only love, really. Is there a better kind? [ Chuckling ] Well, speaking as a normalwoman, yes. As an army woman, no. Matt... Did I ever tell you about my father? No. He died at gettysburg when he was about your age. He was a second lieutenant, too. Your father? Mm-hmm. He was awarded the medal of honor posthumously -- one of the first in its history. The medal of honor... I probably want that more than anything in the world. They still invite me to the award ceremonies. I-I-I always cry a little because it's army. Even when I married Teddy, it was... Just army, never really love. You're my first love, Matt... My only love. So now you know. And if you were mine -- reallymine, I mean -- mine for keeps... I'd take what little love I could get and be grateful for it. Lieutenant hazard! Lieutenant hazard! Kroger tunnelled out of the guardhouse, and that laundress, florita, is missing with him. The captain wants you to take out a pursuit detail to get the men and the horses. All right, thanks. Halt! Forward, ho! Halt! There are the bodies of kroger and florita. Piper! Tell captain gray that we'll pursue the Indians as long as we have food and water. Yes, sir! All right, now, take a good look at 'em. That's gonna make killing apaches a lot easier. They were buried alive. Those ants are eating their brains out. Murphy, cranshaw... Bury 'em. Cranshaw! Dig 'em up and Bury 'em! Sentry go! Gordon! Why aren't you on guard? Cranshaw was on second relief, sir. I swear he didn't wake me. Well, where is he? He's gone. Some of our canteens are missing, sir. Our water supply is low. If we have another forced march, we're in trouble. Do you think you can go get him and bring him back?! Here they come, sir. Sir, I know it looks fishy, me ridin' off like this, but -- why did you run away? I didn't run away. I was on guard and I heard this noise -- and you just went out to investigate. Yes, sir. You see -- you damn lyin' deserter! I'm filing charges to that effect. But what they did to sarge and florita, burying 'em in the sand and those ants -- I couldn't stand thinkin' about -- soldier! I couldn't stand thinkin' about it. I don't wanna die like that! I don't want to die. Sergeant, take charge of the prisoner until we get back to the fort. Yes, sir. Saddle up! Confine him to the guardhouse! Sir, the new C.O. arrived yesterday -- major Prescott. He wants you to report right away. Lieutenant hazard, sir. Mr. Hazard, major Prescott. Did you have a successful mission? Sir, I did not apprehend the killers of sergeant kroger or the laundress, or recapture the horses. I've confined -- lieutenant, I'd prefer you make your report in writing. Oh, Jessica. Mr. Hazard, my wife Jessica. How do you do, Mrs. Prescott? I've been looking forward to meeting you, Mr. Hazard. Thank you very much. By your leave, sir, I'll turn in my report. Yes, lieutenant. Why didn't you tell him? And spoil the surprise? Hiram, sometimes you're impossible. Well, I lose again. Careful. Don't cut yourself. Laura! Well, uh, w-what a surprise. Matt, darling. I hardly recognized you. You don't keep very tidy around here. Well, uh, it wasn't exactly a tidymission we were on. I suppose I should have given you some warning, but mother was visiting friends in Philadelphia, and I just up and left. You didn't tell her? I wired her from Kansas City. Well, goodness gracious, Matt, say something! A girl ought to be complimented on facing up to hardships! Well, it, uh, it is difficult for a woman out here. My picture. I guess your mind didn't stray toofar from me. Well, it, uh, it sure brightened up things. Now that'smy Matt talking. You know, you're just too ideal to go to waste, Matt. Why, there's no commission in this whole army too good for Matt hazard. Now you're trying to change my career. Well, it's my right. Laura, I want you to forget about that. You may find that, uh, you might be getting into something that you don't know about. Why? This old rattletrap camp won't last forever. Well, it's, uh, it's not exactly that. It's that, uh, you may find i'm, uh, I'm not quite the same. All right, if you want to put yourself on trial, I'm sure the prescotts won't mind the general's niece staying with them for a spell. It's good politics. I'll go and let you clean up. You're expected at headquarters for dinner tonight. First I've got to turn in my report. Oh, all right, but don't be late. Mrs. Prescott wants to talk over the arrangements. Arrangements? Mm-hmm. She says there's a Spanish mission up the valley with a priest. Oh. Oh, wonderful, wonderful. [ Sighs ] So... My husband feels we couldn't possibly go to that mission now. The apaches would simply love to attack a wedding party. Goodness gracious! I wouldn't want Matt all shot up before the honeymoon. Be patient, my dear. You'll get him. Yes, ma'am -- patient as a cat with a mouse. I don't reckon anyone's going to try to snatch him away, excepting that otherkitty. Not kitty mainwaring? That's the kitty. [ Knock on door ] Oh, that must be Mrs. Mainwaring now. Oh, Mrs. Mainwaring, I believe you and miss Greenleaf are acquainted. Why, yes, we are. Oh, goodness, I forgot the cookies. Laura, will you pour for Mrs. Mainwaring, please? Yes, ma'am. I think we first met at fort Porter, didn't we? Yes. I was just telling Mrs. Prescott how charming you are. Thank you, Laura. You've blossomed into a lovely young woman yourself. I'm obliged such a lovely lady thinking so. Attention to orders! I wouldn't watch that if I were you. No? You make it sound interesting. Major Prescott: Special order number 284. Having been duly tried and convicted of violation of article four-six of the articles of war, private cranshaw, for having abandoned his post while on sentry duty in the field, is hereby ordered to be formally degraded in public formation by stripping from his uniform all marks and insignia, and ordered to be branded with the recognized Mark of a deserter, and dishonorably discharged from the United States army, by order of brigadier general h.B. Smith, commanding. Take his coat off. Aahhhh! My Matt... Nothing will ever stop him. Does my heartlessness shock you? No. When I married the army, I married all of it... The good andthe bad. Yes, you aremarried, aren't you? Wounded man comin' in! It's Peterson! He went after the remounts with lieutenant mainwaring. What happened to the rest and the 40 horses? You find out, lieutenant. Good afternoon, Mrs. Mainwaring. Hello, Laura. They've been gone for days. I'd hoped they'd be back by now. I guess it doesn't do much good to watch for him. It keeps you from going crazy. Yes, I see what you mean. You've been married a considerable time, haven't you? It seems that way. Kind of a veteran? There's no need to curtsy. Of course not. What I mean is, I have a lot to learn in a hurry, and maybe I can learn from you. What do you think about when he's out there? You hope he'll come back. That's the terrible part, isn't it? You never really know. No. What do you think about? I can even tell you what hethinks about -- duty, career, ambition. You name all the proud words and you've got it. We're talking about the same man, aren't we, Mrs. Mainwaring? Matt hazard! I'm talking about the sum total of a soldier -- Teddy, Matt, my father. The whole blessed bunch of them and the things they die for. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I've been kind of getting the idea that you've had just onetoo many men on your mind. Ho! Forward, ho! Halt! Gordon: It's lieutenant mainwaring. The rest of 'em are in here, sir -- burned to a crisp. Sergeant, assign a burial detail. Yes, sir. Horton, sweeney, drop out! Burial detail. Forward gallop! Ho! [ Apaches chanting ] [ Chanting continues ] [ Gunshots ] [ War cries ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ War cries continue ] Come on! Keep it going! Come on! Hah! Come on! Yee-hoo! Yee-hoo! That's quite a haul -- remounts andindian ponies. Yeah. Ranch horses, too, and the brands are burned off. How about lieutenant mainwaring and his outfit? Massacred. Lieutenant and all the men. I was afraid of that. His poor wife. What are they waiting for in Washington -- war eagle to ride down Pennsylvania Avenue? This is one report I'll make sure they read. I'll send it to general quait at fort Porter. You get some rest before you write it up. I'll break the news to Mrs. Mainwaring. Kitty, I...Should've come sooner, but I... I know. You have a drink? Teddy would have offered it to you. I never thought I'd see the day that I'd appreciate seeley's whiskey. You need it. I didn't sleep. No, neither did I. Hm. My only legacy from Teddy. Where will you... Go from here? I'll try not to look back too much -- shed the false years and try to be myself. What about you? Laura? Yes. Truth is, I'd like to rough up your little miss peachfuzz. Kitty, don't. No, I won't. Mail wagon will be leaving in two weeks. When it goes, I'll be on it. Don't touch me... Remember. [ Trumpet plays reveille ] [ Reveille continues ] Major Prescott: Sentry, how the devil did that camp get set up there without somebody giving the alarm? I don't know, sir. It's been up there all night? I don't know, sir. Two stars on the pennant. Major general Alexander upton quait, or I'll eat my horse. Don't just stand there! Rainey, blow reveille! Into uniform. We'll have to pay our respects. There'll be hell to pay for this. All right, into uniform! On the double! Get going! Good morning, major. I'm captain brinker of the judge advocate's office -- acting adjutant to general quait. Captain. One of the general's old friends is inside paying his respects. He'll be with you in a moment. [ Speaking apache language ] My regards for your alertness, white cloud. The only person in sleepy fort delivery to use the eyes in his head. Intelligens Maximus de ominis. Capt. Brinker: General quait, sir, this is major... Prescott, sir. Captain gray. Lieutenant hazard. Anxius et ententus agere, which you may recall from your tacitus. I translate it to mean "always active, never impulsive." How do you do, gentlemen? Captain gray, tell me, when was the last time that fort delivery was attacked by an unchallenged enemy at night? Sir, we've never been attacked at night. The opportunities for an enemy would seem to be enormous. I should think an army outpost a hundred miles from nowhere with no sentries on duty would be as inviting to an enemy as it is astonishing to me. Captain brinker, a copy of my orders, please. I shall read only the pertinent sections, gentlemen. Please, do listen carefully. "You will proceed to fort delivery, "territory of Arizona. "There to conduct an official inquiry "into illegal and prejudicial actions and activities "resulting in abuse of persons "and destruction and theft of property "perpetrated or authorized by elements of that command. Signed, the secretary of war." At least your presence here saves me the inconvenience of summoning you to the inquiry. An inquiry, sir? Yes. It will proceed as soon as my guests arrive. [ Chanting ] Guests? Chiricahuas? Guests of the inquiry, gentlemen. Shall we be seated, gentlemen? The hearing will come to order. Major hiram Prescott. Sir, I have been authorized by general quait to waive formalities. Major Prescott, did you, on the 24th day of September last, issue certain orders to one of your officers for an operation in the field? I did, sir. Who was that officer? Second lieutenant Matthew hazard. I have here certain papers which you forwarded through channels -- your original orders, his report on his mission in the field. Tell me, major, were there any other orders given verbally which you have not detailed in your report? No, sir. You did not order lieutenant hazard to fire a section of the prairie and return to this post with a hundred stolen horses? No, sir. I refer to certain Indian ponies belonging to the chiricahua nation. Did you, sir, order the theft of those horses? Of course not, sir! When an officer in the field is faced with -- then I am correct in assuming that lieutenant hazard operated beyond the scope of his orders? No, sir, you are notcorrect. Did you order him to fire a section of the prairie? Sir, the general knows perfectly well, that action was necessary in order to effect an escape. Did you give him specific orders for such an action? No, sir. Thank you, major. That's all. Captain gray, you were acting commanding officer on that day. Did you give any verbal orders or instructions to lieutenant hazard to fire an artillery-round shot? I did not, sir, but there were extenuating circumstances, sir. Thank you, captain. That will be all. And now Mr. Seeley Jones, if you please. Mr. Jones, would you tell US your occupation, please? I'm an honorable and respected merchant well-known in these parts. I got a ranch, and I have taken upon myself the job of representative of that great Indian nation, the chiricahua apaches. Did you recently file a claim against the government of the United States of America? Yes, sir, I did. I filed one for myself and I filed one for my beloved friends and their great chief, war eagle, who, unfortunately, was unable to attend this meeting, but he asked me to come in his place. The first claim, in the amount of $6,000, alleges that lieutenant hazard, without cause, did destroy a wagon and the contents thereof belonging to one Mr. Seeley Jones. You're damn right he did. The second claim, in the amount of $14,000, alleges that part of your ranch property was burned off to an extent of approximately 21 square miles by troops under the command of lieutenant hazard. Well, actually, it was more like 30 square -- that's a lie! I burned some brush in a canyon. That's enough, lieutenant. The third claim, in the amount of $15,000, is made by Mr. Seeley Jones as agent of the chiricahua Indians for its loss of a herd of horses stolen by troops under the command of lieutenant hazard. Mr. Jones, I assume that you have witnesses to support these claims? There they are. Thank you, Mr. Jones. I'd just like to say that my own personal grievances just come second to seein' that my beloved friends get justice. Gen. Quait: Lieutenant, were you responsible for the destruction of Mr. Jones' wagon and its contents? I am, sir. Are you also responsible for the action of your troops on September 24th last for setting fire to a section of the prairie? Yes, sir. And are you also responsible for their actions in running off a herd of Indian horses on that same day? I am, sir. Thank you, lieutenant. That will be all. Sir, this is an outrage. The circumstances of these actions are what count. In any fairtrial, provision is made for an adequate defense. Gentlemen, this inquiry is ended. Yes, but its consequences are far from ended. You gentlemen be so kind as to wait for me in the tent while I say goodbye to my friends, the chiricahuas, for their attendance. Whose side is he on, the apaches or ours? [ Speaking apache ] [ Singing in apache ] You all know what I have here. That's the record of the inquiry in which seeley Jones perjured himself. Precisely. I shall deal appropriately with seeley Jones all in good time. Gentlemen, I was forced to let you suffer through a mock trial. Yes. Otherwise, my friends, the chiricahuas, would have detected that you were merely pretendingdistress. It is my hope that they will pass the word on to war eagle that evil will not be tolerated here, neither from my people nor from his own. And perhaps this will cool his ardor, and he'll change his plan about coming charging from Mexico with his entire force. He hassuch a plan? Yes. My Indian reconnaissance has so informed me. His vanguard has already crossed over the little river. Capt. Gray: Isn't it possible, sir, that the information could be a trap? No. No, contrary to certain opinions in Washington, I have never found an apache scout to be faithless of my trust in him. A prime example is chief white cloud. White cloud is a chief? Yes, and a very greatchief. Back in the '70s, when he was my principal enemy, I learned more from that one silent apache than I learned from all the cavalry experts since genghis Khan. Finally, he became my captive. In time, he learned to trust me. And now...Now I shall face war eagle again -- probably the greatest guerrilla fighter in the world today. This, gentlemen, is my plan. If you please. I plan to bivouac in brigade strength just about here, at the junction of the sa-- how dare you intrude on a secret briefing?! I'm not an Indian spy, uncle Alex. By Jupiter, a whole tribe of Indians could have come creeping in here! Where's my sentry?! Don't I have a sentry -- well, gentlemen, I guess that kind of evens the score, huh? You may return to your post. You'll hear from me before the day is out. Wait outside for me, Matt. Uncle Alex won't mind. Ye gods! Now she's countermanding my orders! Very well, lieutenant, you may wait for her. But while you're waiting, you might ponder the perils of civilian entanglements. I brought you a jar of honey and some of your favorite soda biscuits. Mm-hmm. What do you want for them, Laura? Why, nothing, uncle Alex. This Matthew hazard, this the one your mother's been writing me about? She wrote meshe was getting in touch with you. Your dear mother's hints are about as subtle as the blow from the tail of an agitated dinosaur. All we're asking is a promotion for Matt, and, well, maybe a transfer to some nice post not too far from home. When are you leading him to the scaffold, Laura? Doesn't that just sound like a mean, old bachelor? When, Laura? The day after tomorrow, at the mission, and I'm hoping you'll be around to give me away. Well, I'll, uh, certainly think about it. You're sweet, uncle Alex. Halt! Goodbye, Matt. Kitty... Water the geranium, will you? It's kind of an old friend. I'll write to you. No. You just be a good soldier. Murphy. [ Trumpet plays fanfare ] What is it, a drill? Campaign orders. Sergeant: Mount up! There will scarcely be a corporal as guard left here. Campaign? I tell you, Laura, you miss a lot not getting up for reveille. They're off for bivouac. Not Matt. My wedding's tomorrow! Laura, in the army, there's never any certainty of tomorrow. I've got to find him. Don't -- Matt! There's going to be a delay. How long will you be gone? I don't know. Uncle Alex did this to me! As he once said at the academy, the army is a jealous mistress. And he loves her. That's why he's an old bachelor, and mean as sin, to boot! Sergeant: Forward ho! [ Apaches chanting ] General quait, many more horse soldiers -- bear mesa. [ Speaking apache ] War eagle has moved across the border in strength. White cloud is continuing reconnaissance. So, gentlemen, that means that we move, too. Possunt quia posse videntur. They can conquer who believe they can. It's dryden out of Virgil, I think. Bugler! [ Speaking apache ] [ Speaking apache ] It's an old apache maneuver. War eagle's going to break up his main strength, deploy different parties of warriors behind these hills. Hope to catch US in a cross-fire as we come by in full strength. Well, we'll just fight fire with fire. Trumpeter, ho! Halt! There comes the old fox now... Trying to get US to show our hand... Wants US to believe that that's his entire force. [ Speaking apache ] I won't bore you with a translation of war eagle's opinion of the United States cavalry. Let's move on into that draw. We'll regroup and run them off. Deploy! Mr. Hazard, you see that bluff? Deploy to the rear of it and try to make the Ridge. Lt. Hazard: I'll take the river crossing. Some of them will chase me, and I'll ambush them. Fire on the right flank! Halt! [ War cries ] Ho! [ War cries ] Hah! Hah! Hah! Yah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Forward! Troop forward! Carry out! [ War cries ] [ War cries ] All right, mount up! Let's get the hell out of here! [ Trumpet plays fanfare ] Deploy on the right flank! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo-hoo! Woo! [ Speaking apache ] Mount up! Prepare to advance! Lt. Hazard: We won the battle, but it's not a victory. War eagle can hide from US below the border. Veni, vidi, onn vinci. I'll give you the colloquial translation, gentlemen -- outfoxed again. [ White cloud speaking apache ] Major Prescott's. Yes. Thank you. A fine soldier and a gentleman... But a damned useless sacrifice! Soon, war eagle will again be secure in his stronghold in the Sierra madres. We -- we've accomplished nothing! How many more lives must I expend? An entire brigade? In a mountain campaign that might prove endless? No. No, I have in mind a new design. Sit down, hazard. There is an instrument in human affairs which has not yet been used with war eagle. It's called trust. Yes, trust. I've seen it work with white cloud. We only want one man -- war eagle. If we can bring him in, the rest of his people will follow. And I propose to bring him in with only one man. Only oneman to parley with him? Iam that man. But, sir, you're too -- I'm too old, too old for the hardships involved? Sir, yousaid that, I didn't. You belong to this new, young generation of soft living. Watch this. Sentry! All right, you make a spectacle of yourself if you want to. No, sir. I'm saving myself for what's ahead. Oh. Sic transit juveniles. Very well, Mr. Hazard. The job is yours. And at worst, you could possibly wind up with a happier afterlife than an existence with Laura and her mother. If, by any chance, I run into seeley Jones, am I permitted to shoot him? Absolutely not. This is a peaceful mission. White cloud will be your guide, and somewhere out there, in the mountains of Mexico, you'll find war eagle. When you do, you'll give him this, and he will know that you've come from me, because this was his gift to me long ago, before I put him on the reservation. White cloud will need some sense of power as well as your own, so I'm promoting him to the rank of sergeant. When we come back, where will you be? I'll proceed to the river. I'll wait there for you one month, no longer. You mean at the littleriver? Words you once said at west point. Oh, yes. You know, Mr. Hazard, a man is not a man who would permit his people to die needlessly. Would that be from the Latin, sir? No. No, that's from Alexander upton quait. Mr. Hazard, I have a certain persuasive approach you might use in talking to war eagle. You'll be my voice. Come on in, we'll talk about it. Yes, sir. I've studied the apache language. I'll understand it. [ Shouting in apache ] Aaah! I search for war eagle. I come from general quait. And he knows you. Your surrender. If I do not return, general quait will find you, and you will be dead, and all your people. But if you surrender to general quait, you will live a long time. No. You will take your people to the border where general quait awaits you. You will not be punished. By his word, you will live on your own land, on your own reservation in Arizona. And I promise that I will protect you, and give you food and clothing. You will live in peace, and you will remain their chief. Because you must trust me. Because I'm here. Because I trusted you. No. He is not a fool. Youare. A man is not a man who lets his people die when it is hopeless. These are your children. Will you let them die because of the anger in your heart? Be like a father who loves his sons. Tell them to live. You must trust my promises and surrender. We will camp down the mountain. By the time the sun comes up, I want your answer. You'll never get away with it, shavetail. [ Speaking apache ] Those days are over. That's right, war eagle... Yourvalley. Let's take your people home. Hazard? Yes, sir. Major Miller. Is this war eagle? Yes, sir. Where's general quait? He's being replaced. I'll accept their surrender. All right, move 'em out! Now wait a minute! These people have had a hard trip. People? Are you calling them people? It fits them better than some whites I've seen. You better watch out what you're saying, lieutenant. I simply was saying that they need food and rest or they'll be dropping on the trail. And they'll be the good ones -- the ones that are dead. The others will get all the rest they need on their way to Florida. What do you mean Florida? They've made their last rampage in Arizona. Now the chief goes and so does he. That's an army scout! He's an Indian, isn't he? I've made them promises. Where's general quait? At fort delivery. You know, it seems to me, lieutenant, that you should show a lot more respect for a superior officer who has come up from the ranks. With you, it's all academy. No, sir. It's strictly the individual. I was going to commend you for a job well done. Well, you sure changed my mind. By your leave, sir, I'll be returning to fort delivery. You stinking Indian lover. Maybe we ought to pass the hat and get enough money so you can open a cigar store. Maybe so, sir. Hah! Hah! Where's general quait? He went east about a week ago, taking his niece and Mrs. Prescott with him. I've been taking care of the damned geranium. What's the matter, lad? You don't look well. That's strange. Nothing aside from betraying the Indians and slugging a superior officer and losing my girl. Matt. How are you? I don't know. I think I'm in real trouble this time. Yes, I kind of think so. I have here your special orders to report to the department in Washington. You're to be there by the 15th of this month. You ought to grab a fresh horse and keep on going. Captain, if you hear of a real good civilian job, would you let me know about it? I will not. I'd take it myself. Well, lieutenant. General. I'd like to tell you my side of this. Yes. Yes, I was very unhappy leaving you in those unfriendly hands at the border. Then I got wind of that shameful Indian policy, and I rushed back here to make a fight of it... With negative results, I might add. Sir, I deeply regret the Miller incident. As I stated in my report, the fellow's always falling off his horse due to habitual intoxication, I've no doubt. I've never hit a drunk in my life. Lieutenant, how did you enjoy your train ride? All the way from Tucson to Washington, D.C. in 10 days. That's amazing. Mr. Secretary... I have the pleasure to bring before you my most able subordinate officer, lieutenant Matthew hazard. Secretary: Lieutenant Matthew hazard. Soon to be captain, eh, general? Delighted to have you with US, lieutenant. I believe we may now proceed. "Second lieutenant Matthew hazard, sixth cavalry, "having proved his selfless devotion to duty "in an extraordinarily arduous mission "calling for utter disregard to personal safety, "directly leading to a capitulation "of the last enemy among the western tribes "and the consequence saving of many lives "by bringing the Indian wars to a conclusion, "is hereby, with the approval of the president and the congress, "granted the highest military award "within the gift of this nation, "the congressional medal of honor, "with all the rights and privileges thereunto appertaining." My congratulations, lieutenant. Mr. Secretary... I was not alone in Mexico. The man who made possible what we did is an apache scout in the United States army. His name is sergeant white cloud. He's now a prisoner in Florida. Mr. Secretary, he has been betrayed by the United States army, and I'm appealing to you for his immediate release. Lieutenant, if we differentiated among these people, we could never stop. However, your concern does you credit. And now -- you will have my resignation within the hour. And here, Mr. Secretary, is myresignation. I can only ask our honored guests to accept my deepest apologies for this unfortunate incident. That will be all. Thank you. Not quite all, Mr. Secretary, if you please. Will you gentlemen of the press be kind enough to wait for a few moments in the adjoining chamber? We shall have a further very important statement to make. You wouldn't want to go to press without allthe news, would you? Thank you. Lieutenant, you will wait for me in the anteroom. Oh, Matt. Have you lost your mind? I'm just beginning to get it back. All this fuss over some dirty old Indian. Mother is expecting you and uncle Alex. Maybe we can talk some sense into both of you. Wait a minute, Laura. Lieutenant, that took great courage. Stick to your guns, lieutenant. May I shake your hand? And he's so young. And handsome. Yes. Yes. It is imperative that I speak with president Arthur personally. [ Buzzes ] These newfangled knickknacks. And as for you, general, this is blackmail. You're holding those newspaper people over my head. I still have two very good weapons at my command -- the free press and the American voter. Speak plainly. You demand the return of those Indians to Arizona. No, no, no. Not me, Mr. Secretary. I've had my day. A newnational hero demands their return. The medal of honor. You know, I've always wanted one of these. And another thing, general, I won't accept either one of these resignations. Well, I should certainly hope not, Mr. Secretary, with my retirement pension starting next year. Hello? Hello. President Arthur? Yes, sir. Yes, yes. Well, sir, there's been a... A slight hitch with the medal of honor proceedings. Slight hitch. Allow me, Mr. Secretary. Hello, Chester. Yes, Alex here. Fine, fine. You? Good. Yes. A, uh, quite a charming soiree last night, wasn't it? Yeah. No, I'm glad to see you getting out more. Delighted. Now, listen, Chester. Listen very carefully. You're in one hell of a mess with those Indians. [ Plays fanfare ] Soldier: Atten-tion! Captain hazard, it's not within my province to command you to accept the decoration. However, I should like once more to requestthat you do. My position remains the same as it was at Washington, sir. For your information, captain, the chiricahua apaches are now on their way to the reservation. And as for white cloud and war eagle... [ Shouts in apache ] And now, sir, would it disrupt the commanding officer's household if I were to invite myself to dinner on such short notice? Not at all, sir. My wife is an old army squaw. Beg pardon, sir, the troop would like to pay their respects to the captain and his lady. Thank you, sergeant. Present sabers! Three cheers for the captain and his lady. Cheers! Hooray! Hooray!Hooray! Hooray! Cheers! Hooray! Hooray!Hooray! Hooray! Cheers! Hooray! Hooray!Hooray! Hooray!
