Sleep well? Bit difficult explaining shaving cuts, when one uses an electric. (KNOCKING) Come! - Morning, Maria. - Good morning, sir. How's the old chug-chug? Going well. And the family? - Very well, thank you, sir. - Good. Glad to hear it. - Coffee, darling. - Bastard. Bitch. Swine. Slut. Sticks and stones. Sorry about last night. Sorry? Why, Teddy? Don't know, really. Lose again? Well... How much? Enough. Toast? You smashed a rear light. Hit the garage door. And I suppose it was my fault? Something like that. - Although I think I had it in mind. - Well, I can't go to work. Rubbish. What am I supposed to tell them? That I can only model polo-neck sweaters? Look at this. And this. Be cleared up by the weekend. Well, I'm booked today. Fifty an hour, for three hours. I'd have thought you'd have taken better care of one of your few remaining assets. For Christ's sake, put some make-up on it. Make-up? I'd have to dip myself in the bloody stuff. Teddy, go to a psychiatrist. Get some help. It's got to stop. Bullshit. I can't go on. I can't stand it anymore. Got plans, have we? Moving out, are we? I don't think so. Haven't got the guts. Think of the stink. Publicity. It would hit you harder than it would hit me. Anyway, what would your precious Mummy have to say? What about your affairs? - That would all have to come out. - Look, I haven't had any affairs. I wish I had. You accuse me all the time, because it turns you on. A fine thing for our boy. All those little tykes at boarding school, chanting, "Your mother's a whore, your mother's a whore." Oh, Teddy, stop it. Look, I've said I'm sorry. Put some make-up on, and go to work. Tell them you were in a car smash. Tell them you went into a ditch. Tell them you were drunk. They'll believe that easily enough. Tell them anything. We need the bread, Angel. Have a nice day. MARK: That's nice, Diane. Straight into those. Keep it into the lens. Foc... nice! No, no, keep-keep-keep that. Back into the bear. Keep... Nice, hold that. Don't move. That's lovely. I'll tell you what, let's try putting the boa around the bear's neck. - See what that looks like. - Yes, but... But-but nothing. We could burn your battle scars out a bit with this baby. What happened to the car? Is it a write-off? No, no. Not that bad. - I got the worst of it. - So I see. Carrie, can you just... Please! That's nice. Leave it. Nice. Don't try and compete with the bear. Nice! Nice, nice. No, too much. Nice. Tiny smile. Nice. Straight into the camera. That's it. Thank you. - Wasn't too painful, was it? - No. Thanks. My pleasure. - Do you want to change yet? - Oh, yes, please. Okey-doke, I'll be with you in just a sec. Okay, right... Jesus! Some car crash! I know. The branch of a tree, twanging on my backside. What was it playing, "Stars and Stripes"? - Bye, Mark. - Bye, Diane. I'll see you on the, er... - Fifteenth. - Right. - And stay out of trouble, eh? - What? I said, drive carefully. - Bye-bye. - Bye. That husband of hers must be a bastard. He is. If she were black, it wouldn't show, of course, would it? - What about the marks on her psyche? - Ah, those... Completely different thing. - What are you doing? - Darling, keep away. There's a rabbit here in a Godawful mess. I don't know if it's been shot, or savaged. Well, you must kill it. Put it out of its misery. I can't. I can't kill the wretched thing. But you shoot. Now, what's the difference? Well, they're up in the air. When they get to the ground, it's all over. Well, you can't leave it there. Oh, my God! Teddy, you must kill it. We can't just leave it to die in agony. I can't. Oh, don't be so pathetic! I'll do it. Let's go out this evening. Make a night of it. All right. Where? I dunno. Down the road. Four Feathers? Probably have rabbit pie. - What did you do today? - Audition. They wanted the mother image. Get it? They're mad. All right, are we, then? Truce, or peace? Oh, I don't know. I can't vouch for it. We'll be all right. Will we? And the next time? Oh, for fuck's sake. Sexual hang-ups, generally, result from a continuance into adult life of childhood imaginings of guilt or inferiority. Obviously, that's not the complete explanation. Genetic factors can contribute to a child's inability to... grow out of parental holds. For example, it's believed that homosexual tendencies can be the result of chromosomal imbalances, but the brute syndrome is not likely to have a... an inborn factor. My problem, Mrs Shepherd, is that although you have come to consult me, you are not, so far as I can see, in need of treatment. It's your husband who should be here. Oh, I know, I know, but... Well, how do I get him to come and see you? In public, when we're with people, he's... He's perfectly normal. He's charming, solicitous... Well, at home, too, most of the time. - Then, suddenly out of nowhere, he's... - Yes. If I could find some way of convincing him. If only I could explain, prove to him, that you could help him. Us. Why do you think he does these things? - (CHUCKLING) - What started him off? If I could answer that in one session, I'd be out of business. The simplistic answers are boringly predictable. You've heard them all a hundred times. Getting even with mother, a child of a broken marriage, being raised in an institution, a throwback to toilet training. No, I'm sorry, these things are not that simple. Get him to come and see me. Which do you think, darling? This... or this? Either. Or... Or perhaps this one? Yes. Yes, which? Oh, that one. The pink. - Not too tarty? - (CHUCKLING) No. And what's your mother going to say? To hell with her. And your father? And him. All right, pink it is. Get me another drink, there's a darling. Thanks. Teddy? Can we talk about something? Yes, when you've got me my drink. Yes, in a minute. I've been to see a psychiatrist. Have you? Gone a bit loony, have you? You know why I've been. No, I don't. I went for help. For both of us. I don't need any help, unless an unsecured loan, something like that. - He wants you go to and see him. - I bet he does! And what do you pay him for his little homilies? Gold bricks? No cheques, cash preferred, well, you know how it is. So much easier. It's not a question of money. Oh, free, is he? Does it for a worthy cause? - Look, I'll pay for it. - Will you? Will you, dear heart? Get me my drink, there's a good girl. So, you think I've gone bananas, do you? Think I'm in need of care and attention, eh? Such a comfort to have a clever wife. Such a help to have a little woman who helps out. I mean, such a joy to come home to. If she's at home, that is. Not fornicating some place. Having it off with all and sundry. Aren't you frightened, dear? Of picking something up? Of catching something? Social disease? Well that's what comes of being social. (GASPING) Such a boon to have a wife who wears the trousers. Oh! So capable, so beautiful, so profitable. What will I do without you, dear heart? - (DOOR SLAMMING) - Come back! Come back here, you bitch! (DIALLING) Hello, Mother. - I'm afraid we'll have to call off tonight. - (CAR DEPARTING RAPIDLY) It's Diane. She's not well. Well, you know. Yes, I know, I'm sorry. Another time, perhaps. Can't be helped. (KNOCKING) - Oh, Mark! Is Carrie here? - Not right now. Christ, you look freezing. Come in. What's all this you're wearing, then? Fancy dress? Oh. Today's the walkout. Or rather, run-out. Hope you remembered your jewellery. That was a long time ago. - Brandy? - Mmm, exactly what I need. Do you get roughed up? Well, so much for my car crash. Though this time, it was a touch of drag. I put out a dress, he put it on. - How'd he look? - Awful. (CHUCKLING) Hey, do you think Carrie could put me up, just for the night? Sure, she could. Jesus Christ, look at the time. Listen, we're going out tonight, to meet some people. - Why don't you come along? - What, like this? - No, we'll pick out some of Carrie's stuff. - Okay. - Hope she won't mind. - No, she won't. There's enough stuff up here to start a bloody jumble sale. Now... What's you? It's... Try that. Trousers... - Grey's not you, is it? - Nn-nnn. Not at all, no. Jeans? - That'll be fine. - Yeah? - Try them. - Great. Now, is there anything else we can do for you? Scarf. What about that? Oh, for Christ's sake, I see nothing but nudes all day. Wouldn't mind seeing another one, though. Know what I mean? (CHUCKLING) (CHATTERING) - Had a nice time? - Yeah! - Hi. How are you? - Hey, you look marvellous! - Out and about? - Yeah. I've got a poncho like that. And a scarf like that as well. I left in rather a hurry. A little run-in with the old man. - Oh. - Mark kitted me out. - Hope you don't mind. - Oh, no, no, not at all. Could have done better than those that Mark had torn to pieces. With me in them, they will. - Ah, Diane, meet David. - Hi. - Want a drink? - Yeah. Scotch, please. - Are you, erm... Are you okay? - Yes. - Hello, Diane. - Hello. How are you? You don't look like a bird on the lam. No, the reaction hasn't set in. Yet. - Ah, the first two weeks are the worst. - Thank you. - You'll be fine. - Will I? Won't you? Oh, I dunno. What's the point? There's Tim to think of, but is it any use papering over the cracks for his sake? He'll probably get worse. Or found out. Does, um... Teddy know you came by my house? - Nope. I just took off. - Ah, well, lie low for a while. Hey, Mark! Drinks! One each. Hey. Mmm... Morning. - Morning? It's afternoon! - You're kidding! Oh, take it easy. You've got nowhere to go, do you? No. Thank you. - Sugar? - Mmm. Thanks. (DOOR CLOSING) Hey, Carrie. "I like 'em young and fresh, ' says the Cowboy Casanova." - (CARRIE GIGGLING) - "Shocked. 'I can out now on the street "and pull any women I wanted. "It's something I can do." (CHUCKLING) - Is she all right? - Oh. Oh, she's fine. She didn't creep off during the night, then? - No. - Oh, she will. - Why? - Oh, she will. They always go back. Oh, I don't think so. Yeah, with the house and the kid and all the rest of it. Plus those county types that she associates with. And what's all this about "county types"? Oh, no, I was just saying that, er... I might take up horse riding, or fencing, or something. Or golf. Hey, what do you think I'd be like wielding a golf club? - Pretty silly. - Silly? Oh, you're too feeble even to get the club off the ground. Feeble? What the fuck are you talking about? I'm not feeble! - (CARRIE LAUGHING) - Eh? What do you mean, feeble? - CARRIE: You know what I mean. - MARK: Well, listen, if I'm feeble, why doesn't Diane hop in with us and spend the afternoon shacked up for a bit of nookie, eh? - Is he always like this? - Oh, he tries. Mmm... - That's a feeble tongue. - (LAUGHING) (ENGINE STARTING) (GASPING) (GASPING) (DOOR OPENING) Mmm... - Mark! - Ssh! Ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh! - It's all right. - No, we can't. Carrie's upstairs. MARK: She's asleep. (AUDIBLE MOANING) MARK: Oh, you really turn me on. Right, here's your scarf. Hello, darling! Hello, Timmy! Meeting was cancelled. Tried to contact you. Waste of petrol, what a bore. Well, young man, what have you got to say for yourself? I swam three widths yesterday, Daddy. I was going for four, but Mr Wilton hauled me out. TEDDY: Well done, that boy! Future Channel swimmer, obviously. Well, tea for three, cha-cha-cha. In you get. - Fancy seeing you here. - Yes, well... Hope you haven't been saying any silly things to the lad? Of course not. I want you back. Oh yes? Planning to cut me into little strips, too? You can always get some new stuff. Looks as if you've made a start already. Shall I send you the bills? I'm sorry. I've said I'm sorry. I was in a panic about money. You know how it is. But the old man's come across. We should be all right now. Financially, maybe. Come on. Ritual tea. - Will you see the psychiatrist? - No, I bloody won't. (ENGINE STARTING) TEDDY: Timmy, your move. Go on. Go on, make a beast of yourself. If you leave your car at the school, I'll get it picked up later. No, I'm working tomorrow. ...I need it first thing. Where? Some place in the City. I wrote it down somewhere. Let's have a look. Perhaps I could... Perhaps I could drop you there. I'll find it. - Another cup? - Thanks. Please may I leave the table? Yes, of course you may. Know where it is? - Yes. - Off you go, then. Diane, I... I want you to come back. The folks were round yesterday. Mother was snooping about. Naturally. - You've got to come back. - Oh? Or say goodbye to Tim. - I'd get custody. - Don't think so. I do. You left the matrimonial home. That's because you drove me to it. Proof? Well, you beat me black and blue! (WHISPERING) Voices, please. Proof? Doctor? Should have thought of that. Anyway, I'd say it was one of your lovers. My clothes. Cutting up my clothes. Proof? Enjoy my little joke with the inflatable lady? You foul bastard. How nice. (CAMERA CLICKING) CLIENT: Just a sec! Just a sec! Oh, God. I am right, aren't I? - If it's what you want. - What we all want. You like it, I think it stinks. Anyway, the light's going. We've probably got it on the Pentax. We'll see what comes out in the bath. Thank you. Oh, it's hopeless, it really is. She's like a stiff. Listen, do you think she could just kinda swing into it a bit? It's the skirt, it just doesn't fall right. Yes, yes, yes, fuck the skirt. You're speaking of the product we love. Did you get that out of a book? - Right, Diane? - Mm-hmm? Let's see the hand on the hip, all right? (CAMERA CLICKING) - Nice. Yeah. - (CAMERA CONTINUES CLICKING) No, back. Hand on the hip. I like it. I like it. I don't like... No, I don't like it. I don't... Back. That's nice. Hand down. Nice! Right, we've got it. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Sorry about that, Prim. Bit of artistic temperament. Know what I mean? - You got the keys to the car? - Yeah. Look after the clients, will you? I've really had it with them. - I can see that. - Thanks. Okay? We're just gonna go for a little ride. - What are you doing? - In! Get in! (ENGINE STARTING) Right, out. - What? - Get out. - Get out of the car. - Okay, I'm coming. Okay. I've been wanting you all day. You were getting... You were getting very cross with that lady. I've already said what I think about that lady. DIANE: Look... - MARK: That lady... - Careful... Careful of my skirt! It's gonna get all marked. - No. No. - Yes. Yes. Come on. No, we shouldn't... I know what we shouldn't. We ought to black you up a bit. Make you look like Carrie, eh? You'd make a beautiful little coon. - No! - Yeah, Diane. You like it a little bit rough, don't you? Yes... Yes... Yes. (BOTH PANTING) (DIANE MOANING) Yes, yes, yes. (LOUDER MOANING) (MOANING STOPS) Hello, little one! Hello. Hello. CARRIE: Diane? Say hello to Millie. We already have! - And that's Charlie. - Good for you, Charlie. - Hi. - DIANE: Hello. Have you washed your hair again? DIANE: Mark took me back to the studio. Thought I might as well. - Neurotic. - Thanks, Carrie. Some people bite their nails. She washes her hair. Hey, I waited a long time for you. Then thought, "What, the hell with it," and came home. Yeah, we stopped for a drink. - Mark was seething. - CARRIE: I bet he was. I had to go all the way back to town with her. Boring little fag hag. Hey, you okay, or you want something stronger? No, this is lovely. - Thank you, Carrie. - Oh, good. - Hey, Millie's a member of your club. - What? Biffed, battered and bewildered. Her old man clobbered her one. Show her the eye. Oh, my God. Poor girl. How long has it... - You are married? - Oh, yes. That was my first mistake. Well, my second. DIANE: When did it start? At the beginning. No... Oh, I don't know. We were all right at first. Now, he hates having me around, but too scared to make it alone. (KNOCKING) Oh, shit. CARRIE: Yeah? - MAN: Oh, hi, Carrie. - CARRIE: Hello, Alan. - ALAN: My bird here? - Yeah, yeah, she's here. Great. Hello, darling. Thought I'd find you here. Charlie-arlie! How's me boy, eh? - Diane, Alan. - Give us a kiss. - Alan, Diane. - Oh, hello. - You want a coffee or anything? - That's all right, I've just had one. You ready? Yeah. Sorry. (CHUCKLING) I'll take him. No, it's all right. I've got him. Let's go. Goodbye. (MIMICKING UPPER-CLASS ACCENT) Awfully nice to meet you. - Jesus. - Yeah. - (CHARLIE CHATTERING) - That's right. Who's Mrs Uptight, then? Diane. Yeah, I got that part. Who is she? How do I know? She's a friend of Carrie's. Built like an ice lolly. Does she belch and break wind just like the rest of us? I expect so. What you tell 'em? You walked into a door? No, I told them you put your fist in my face. Ah. What do they say? "Ah, poor you," and all that crap? I bet you didn't tell them how you bored me shitless with all your "Why this, why that?" MILLIE: They sussed you out without any help from me. Hope you defended me. You're very critical. - Critical? - Come on! Here! Hit me! Come on! Get your own back! - Alan, stop it. - No, no. No, look, seriously. Hit me. Come on, I'm full of remorse. MILLIE: Remorse? You're full of crap. Now, I'm mortified. I really am mortified. I mean, how could I lay a finger on you, eh? English rose, untouched by human hand. I mean, how could I lay a finger on you? Except that you bore me rigid, you frigid bitch. Come on. Here, give us a quid. - No! - Yeah, come on. - Alan! - God, where's that bloody purse? Here you are. Ha! Hoarding. Very nasty habit. Very unhealthy. Right, I'll get him a packet of crisps. And for you, love of my life? A Coke? No, no, something stronger. Carrot juice. No, syrup of figs. BOY: Is it a boy or a girl? It is a boy. - What's his name? - Charlie. What's yours? Rickie. My mum got it off the television. - What? - My name. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Here you are, Charlie-are. Tell you what. Thought I'd stay in tonight. Keep you company. Great. Hello! - CARRIE: Hello. - Where is everybody? - Who's "everybody"? - You, Diane... How about some service round here? What can I get you? Rat poison? Cyanide? A little strychnine on the side, maybe? I've had a very heavy day. Yes, I know. I was there. Some of the time. That bloody Primrose. You can call her up and tell her I don't wanna know. I'd rather go out and dig ditches. Or make hay? Couldn't you wait until you got back to the studio? What are you talking about? Oh, come on. You could've at least put the car out of sight. She wanted to go out and pick some wild flowers. It's not unnatural in the countryside, you know. What was she after? Deadly nightshade? - Where is she? - Oh, she went to get some vodka. Oh, so we're out of vodka now, are we? - Yes, smartass. - What's for supper? You. Spit-roasted. I'm not hungry, thank you very much. Good. Hey, you. Come on, look lively! We've got guests. Well, come on! Jump to it! What's the time? Never mind the time. You'd spend your life sleeping... - Alan! Please! - ...given half the chance. Now, come on! Let's have some service round here, eh? Come on, you slut. Eric, wife. Wife, Eric. - Hello, Eric. - Hello. We want some grub. Fry-up. - Go on. - All right. Ah, come on! Never mind the frigging fags! Christ, can't you do anything without a cigarette stuck in your mouth? Jesus! You know what? She'd smoke on the job, given half a chance. Remember that Oriental bit in that film, eh? Smoking with her fanny? This one could do that, with a little practice. It might improve matters. Yeah! Dullest jump in the district! Doesn't like it. You know, "Dirty", "Messy". I don't know how your mummy and daddy got around to having you. He must have mailed it in. Go on! "Fie, fie, cover thyself, woman." - Get up, you slag! - (MILLIE GROANING) - Hold on! - MILLIE: No! Please! No! What are you? A bloody lunatic? All right, all right. Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Jesus, let's have a drink. - What do you want? Bacon and eggs? - Yeah, sure. - What, two eggs? - Yeah, anything. I mean, she's a good kid, really. Just needs a bit of discipline. Be a credit to the regiment. - The regiment. - ERIC: The regiment. - DIANE: Mark... - MARK: Ssh! DIANE: No, it's not right. No, Carrie's... - MARK: Carrie's asleep. - DIANE: Mark, no. - MARK: Ssh-ssh-ssh. - DIANE: We mustn't. Mark, please. MARK: Come on, Diane. Come on. - DIANE: Mark! - MARK: Yes... - DIANE: No. - MARK: Oh, yes. DIANE: No... No... TEDDY: Oh, you're mine, you're mine. You're mine. Tell me. Tell me you're mine. Oh, God. You'll always be mine, you know that? You'll always be mine. You're mine. Tell me. Tell me you're mine. DIANE: I'm yours, baby. TEDDY: Oh, God. You'll always be mine. You know that? You'll always be mine. I'll never be able to do without you. Never, never be without you. - DIANE: Say that you love me. - TEDDY: Oh, I do, I do. - DIANE: Say that you love me. - TEDDY: My God, I love you! Sweet, sweet woman. - DIANE: Oh, no. - MARK: Yes. You love it. TEDDY: You'll always be mine. Only mine, you know that? You're my lifeline. I'll never be able to do without you. Not ever. Not ever. - DIANE: Say that you love me. - TEDDY: Oh, I do. I do, I do. I love you so much. CARRIE: Oh, yes... MARK: Sssh... (MOANING) - CARRIE: You like that? - MARK: Yes. - CARRIE: Do you like it? - MARK: Oh, yes. Oh, stop it. Stop it. (CARRIE MOANING) DIANE Hi. I'm back. Yes. Well? Welcome back. What's that? Oh, it's some supper. I'm afraid I only bought for me. I'm sure we can do better than that. How have you been? All right. You? So-so. Bit bored. The office? How are things? Oh, you know the old man. Into everything. Is it too early to think about a drink? No, I wouldn't say so. I'll get them. The usual? What the...? Oh, I've been practically camping out in here. Whole damn house gives me the creeps. Oh. - Want some? - Mmm. Smashing meal. - More than a pretty face. - Thank you. Did you read Tim's letter? Yes. All very well him being good at sports... Oh, give him time. He'll do all right. Yes, of course he will. God, he's growing up. Seems a different person every time I see him. Yes, isn't he just? You know, I thought we might take him to Salcombe this summer. - Yes, let's! - We haven't been there for years. Well, Tim's never been there. All this going abroad. And what could be better than good old Salcombe? When the sun shines. Christ, I've missed you. What did you do? What? When? You know, when... you were... away. Oh, I hung around with Carrie and Mark, mostly. Don't know what you see in that lot. Carrie's very kind. And him? Yes. Flash little bugger. Still, you're here now. Yes. (CAT MIAOWING) Di, darling. - Dil. - Yes? - Got a minute? - Brushing my hair. I want you. What, darling? Want to show you something. Yes? Oh, you've made up the fire. - Thought we were going to bed. - We are. I just thought, for old times' sake, we might have a little fireside... Chat? Something like that. What's that? - What? - There. In the fire. Oh, that. It's rather interesting. I picked it up in a little junk shop. It's a branding iron. I had to get it. - It has a "D" on it. - No! Get off! Teddy, no! No! Teddy, no! No! - Fucking bitch! - (DIANE SCREAMING) DIANE: No, Teddy! No! (TEDDY ROARING IN PAIN) DIANE: No! No! - (HISSING) - (TEDDY YELLING) (GASPING) Oh, help me. Help me. I came back, you bastard! (CLATTERING) (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO) (INAUDIBLE) (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO) TEDDY: That you, darling? Yes, it is me, darling. Where is it? I say, the law! What on earth have you been up to? Where is it? What have you done with it? - What? - The branding iron. Branding iron? Oh, Sergeant. Where... Where did you find her? We received a call from a coinbox in Utley Lane. The lady has made a formal complaint that you attacked her with a branding iron, intending to cause physical injury. Physical injury? Well, I should think it would! My God, you really have done it this time. The other night, she woke up screaming that I was trying to strangle her. I was fast asleep. Look, I threw it down. He must have hidden it. Help me find it. Hold on, hold on. I think that's going a bit far. - Have we a warrant? - No, sir. There is a limit. I hope we're not going to make a habit out of this. Get up, and show them what I've done to you! Now, calm down, darling. Now, if this goes on, you know, we really will have to... I don't know what the doctor would say about this. Look, look, make him stand up. Then you'll see what I've done. Summon me for assault, if you like. Sergeant, I really do apologise about this. I had no idea she'd even left the house. I thought she'd gone to bed. I don't suppose there's any chance of you gentlemen accepting a drink on such a cold night? No, sir. Thank you, sir. Well, I don't think there's anything for us here. Good night, sir. Good night, madam. Wait, you can't leave me here! Why don't you go off to bed, madam? I'm sure in the morning... Oh, my God! Look, at least help me get my car out. - You can't leave me with that madman. - SERGEANT: I don't think it would be advisable for you to be out driving around in your present state of... DIANE: You're not, I take it, accusing me of being drunk? - No, madam. - And I take it you're not diagnosing insanity? - No. - DIANE: Well, then, surely it's not too much to ask you to wait until I'm out of here? - Very well, madam. - Oh, just wait. (RUNNING UPSTAIRS) DIANE: So, here I am again, and the police think I'm mad. He's as sane as all get out, and I'm mad. - Where's Mark? - Playing an away game. - Game? - Come on, Diane. You know our Mark. You mean, you knew about... Well, sweetheart. Banging away in the next room... - Yes, well, he... - Oh, don't worry about it, Di. You know those sheep Little Bo Peep had? That's our Mark for ya. He'll come home, waggin' his tail behind him. The son of a bitch is mine, till I decide to get rid of him. He's asked me to marry him, and all that shit. But who needs it? Don't you want to marry? Have kids? I don't know. Maybe. But, after seeing you, and Millie, and all those battered wives, the holy state of matrimony does not appeal to me. Yeah, well, I'd certainly find it difficult to recommend. All I wanna do is to... is to make a home for Tim, and to hell with men. For now. Right. (WHIMPERING) No. (SHRIEKING) (SCREAMING) No! No! No! (SCREAMING) No! No! (SCREAMING) Diane! You're just dreaming. You're just dreaming. - It's all right. - Oh, I'm not safe here. He knows I'm here. He's gonna come after me. I can't stay! I can't stay! Doesn't matter. He won't come to us, and, even if he does, the door is barred and bolted. Look, just-just-just-just relax. Okay? Lie back. Just-just lie back. It's okay. I'm here. It's all right. Come on, calm down. Calm down. (SOBBING) And you ask me if I wanna get married! Like hell I do. (DIANE CONTINUES SOBBING) Carrie? Yeah? There's somebody outside. What's the matter? Look, out there. That man. Oh, so there's a man outside. It's a free country. Well, do you think he's a private detective? Oh, Diane, I'm supposed to be the only spook around here. Well, he's gone. Good. Now, relax. Well, I know. It's just I feel so uneasy. Teddy's such a conniving bastard. Tell me something I don't know. MARK: Yeah, Archel Road, just off the North End Road. (WHOOPING) MILLIE: Charlie? Will you get back where the lady put you! - Now, just jolly well behave! - (CARRIE LAUGHING) MILLIE: I'm sorry, Carrie. He's not usually like this. Oh, it's okay. He likes 'em like that. Don't you, Mark? MARK: Are you gonna come out and be Colonel Custer? - Do you want some coffee? - Yes, please, I'd love some. - MARK: Sit down here. - CHILD: Where do I go? - CARRIE: Black or white? - White, please. - Not too much coffee for me. - CARRIE: Okay. (SIGHING) So, then, how are things at home? - I've done a bunk. - You're joking! - Why? When? - Last night. Alan got back from work and beat the living shit out of me. Then, he went off to get loaded. Quite frankly, I was too damn scared to stay for the second act. Where'd you go? Um... What did you do? I went to a commune. For battered wives. Millie, you poor sod. Why didn't you come to us? Because he would have found us. I'm surprised he didn't come looking, actually. Probably too pissed. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. Well, what about your family, your parents? Mum and Dad? Disowned me years ago. My sister doesn't even wanna know. Stuck-up cow. What's it like at the commune? Rough, but at least that bastard won't get in there. Millie... Oh, charming! It's all mucked up. - Come on, then. - We can take the tent home? No, we can't take the tent home, 'cause it's not ours. Yes, we can, 'cause it's ours. No, it's not. Now, say goodbye to your friend. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - I hear you moved out? - Yes. - You all right for bread? - Sure. This'll help. They say at the house they can help me get some social security. Yeah, you can't live on social bloody security for ever, can you? Oh, something'll turn up. It always does. - Oh, thanks for Charlie. He was lovely. - MILLIE: Thank you. (CAR DOOR OPENING) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (BUZZER) (CHILD CRYING) - Is Mrs Newley there? - Yes. Could I see her? I am a friend. - Oh, yes, yes, of course. Come in. - Thank you. - You haven't seen Mrs Newley around? - No. Try upstairs. - Sorry. - Thank you. Have you seen Mrs Newley anywhere? Oh. She was on kitchens this morning. Have you tried the back? Oh, there she is, by the swing. Is that who you mean? DIANE: Yes, that's her. Thank you. - Hello, Millie! - Hello! It's Diane, isn't it? Don't tell me you've landed up here. - No. Carrie told me you were here. - Ah. - How are you? - (SIGHING) All right. It's not paradise, but at least it's a roof over our heads, and no things that go bump in the night. - Have you heard from Alan? - Oh, yes. He tried to see me, but characters like that don't get in here that easily. He sent me one of those notes. "Come home. All is forgiven." He's got some hope. - I'm taking him to court. - Are you? Well, how are you going to go about it? Well, there's a doctor here who helps, so at least I've got some medical evidence. My doctor was absolutely useless. All he did was fill me full of tranquillisers. It was Alan who needed the tranquillisers. - DIANE: You're going to divorce him? - MILLIE: Oh, yes. Yeah, me too. But my trouble is, I have no evidence, and I'm not going back to fetch any. Did Carrie tell you that he came at me with a branding iron? - Jesus Christ! - Yeah. I took it off him, and gave him a shot of his own medicine. There's a kid in here, she's barely twenty, she's got two kids. Her old man broke her collarbone. And then there's another one, in my room. She's covered in cigarette burns. Well, how many are there here? Well, it's supposed to be thirty, but it's usually double that. They can't turn people away. Look, Millie, I've taken a flat. I'm... I couldn't go on staying with Carrie. She's been marvellous, but... Well, I earn quite a lot, so I've taken a place. Come and share it with me. Oh, that's very kind. But I'm not earning anything. Only a few quid from social security. Look, it doesn't matter. It's not a palace, but it's better than... Well, it... At least there's some space. And it'd be good for Charlie. Yes. Poor little Charlie. Oh, I don't know. I suppose I could get a job. Put him in day school. But what on earth good are six O-levels, two A-levels and an arts degree - when I can't even type? - Well, learn. Give it a try. Okay? No, it wouldn't work. But thanks all the same. We'll manage. Well, I'll leave you the address in case you change your mind. Thank you. Give him a couple more minutes, and we'll go in and get some tea. - Lovely. - MILLIE: There we go. - Want a high swing? - Yes. MILLIE: Yes? Wow! How about that! Gosh! What do you mean, you didn't like any of them? I sent you a positive bevy of the best-looking girls in the business and you didn't like them. Yes, yes, the client this, the client that. Why don't they leave it to the experts? All right, all right. - I'll do my best. - Hi. Can I come in? Hey, wait a minute. The answer to your problem just walked in. Diane Shepherd. She just this minute walked through the door. I know she's great. Yes, she just might do it. For you. - Free tomorrow? - Mmm. Well, listen. Di's expensive. You can double that. Right. Mm-hmm. It's a deal. Bye. It should be so easy. Louis Brock, two till six, sportswear. - Okay? - Fine. Any news on the beer commercial? Er... You're in the last three. Glad you walked in. That man is so difficult. Glad I did. Hmm. Had an odd call about you yesterday. - Oh? - Some creep wanting your phone number. - Said he'd worked with you. - You didn't give it to him, did you? Are you kidding? I told him to write, care of me. He's back again. Could you look after Charlie for a moment for me? - Don't go out there. - Don't worry, I won't. Please, could you lend me 2p? Thank you. Carrie? It's Millie. Look, Alan's here again. What do I do? Look, just stay calm. We're on our way. We've got to go. Something's come up. - Not now, I'm in the middle of a shot. - Look, it's important. Millie's in trouble. - Oh, not that Alan again. - Yes. Isn't it amazing sometimes, being with a bloke like me, always kind, considerate, never so much as raise a fist to you? Well, if you did, I'd knock you right out. That's exactly why I don't do it. Right, now! CARRIE: It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. MARK: So I grabbed hold of him by the scruff of the neck, didn't I, and I said, "Listen, bozo..." - You got a cigarette? - "You want..." Yes, I have got a cigarette. I said, "Listen, bozo, you want any trouble?" - Got a light? - No, I haven't got a light, Carrie. I said, "Listen, bozo. You want trouble, "you come to the right boy, right? You come to the kiddie, okay?" "You touch that lady once more, "and I'll break every bone in your body." CARRIE: Oh, I mean, he was a real Superman. - Yeah! - Drink this. It'll steady your nerves. (MUFFLED) I was all right! I was a driver. I was a kiddie, wasn't I? Vrooom! - Thanks, everybody. - My pleasure, kid. - Oh! - Nothing is too much for you. There we go. I got six. Is that enough? They'll last forever! Thank you. - Is he very scared of the dark? - A bit. He'll sleep tonight, though. So shall I. Was it tough at the house? Yes, it was. Charlie loved it. All those kids to play with. The worst part was at night. Eight, ten of us, all in one room. People waking up crying. Kids coughing. Women lying awake, thinking about it, wondering what to do, where to go, How to start all over again. Wondering what they'd done to deserve it. Just like wartime. With whole families sleeping together in the Underground. Thousands of them. But they got up to face the day. Yes. Makes our wars sound pretty trivial. Ah, but ours are undeclared. The worst kind. You don't know who or what you're fighting. How did it start? Your war. Mine? Slowly and quietly. It was verbal at first. You know, if I didn't find his every thought remarkable, or laugh at jokes I'd heard a thousand times before, I'd get the lash of his tongue. Then it got between the sheets. From being a reasonable lover, he started to rush it, knock it off, like some kid behind a hedge. There was no... no feeling of sharing anything. Just a quick poke for his convenience. Hmm. How about you? Oh... I just don't know when it started, or even if it did. You see, we did love each other. I think sometimes we still do, but it's... beyond repair. This... This thing has got a hold of him. He doesn't even try to shake it off. He... He wanted to brand me. He wanted to mark me. And yet, he was the most... marvellous lover any woman could ever want. So I think that was it. I think his love-making took him... over the line, into some... strange, violent no-man's-land, and he couldn't get back. He... wanted to go further and further into the darkness. That's sad. I don't think Alan ever got any sexual kick out of knocking me about. Sheer contempt. Began to hate me. I really do believe that if we hadn't left when we did, he'd have... torn me apart, limb for limb. Yes, but he wanted you back. It must have meant something. It meant he hadn't finished the job. He hadn't finished dismantling me. I think my baby's gone to sleep. Yes. I'm terribly sorry you had such a fruitless journey. Not so fast, Simpson! But, as I say, Tim's father collected him last evening. We are, of course, expecting him back before supper. Yes, of course. Well... Can I come back, just for a short while? Well, it would be rather irregular. Excuse me. Hello, Mrs Denison! Nice to see you out and about again! - Fully recovered? - Yes, I am, thank you. - Gavin has kept us in touch. - I'm sure he has. So sorry... I don't want to pry, but we do have some experience of this sort of situation. And it can be very unsettling for the child. Yes, I know. Thank you, Mr Porsham. Goodbye. Goodbye. And don't worry too much about Tim. He's a bright boy, and he is doing very well. Thank you. (PHONE RINGING) (ENDING CALL) (DIALLING) (PHONE RINGING) - (RAPID BEEPING) - (INSERTING COIN) - WOMAN: Yes? - Hello, Grandmother? This is Diane. - Hello, Diane. - Is Tim with you? - Yes. - Can I speak to him? I don't think that would be a very good idea, Diane. He's perfectly all right, and I don't think he should be embroiled in this unpleasantness any more than is strictly necessary. I'm not going to embroil him in anything. I... I simply want to speak to my son. I think you should take that up with Teddy. I understand he has taken legal advice on all this. Legal advice? Well, you can tell your precious son that I shall be taking some legal advice. If he thinks he's going to deprive me of my son, he's very much mistaken. That will be a matter for the court to decide. I hardly think any judge would approve the extraordinary menage you're involved with. "Menage"? VW hat are you talking about? I moved in with a friend for a few nights, until I found a place. It was certainly no menage. Well, I hardly know how else to describe it. Some weird coloured girl, this photographer man, a divorce and no stranger to the gutter press. Grandmother, I stayed with Carrie and Mark for a few nights after your son attacked me with a branding iron. Diane, I refuse to listen to any more of this sordid nonsense. I'll tell Tim that you called. Goodbye. (REPLACING RECEIVER) (ENGINE STARTING) DIANE: Did you have a nice time at Granny's? - TIM: Yes. - DIANE: What did you do? - Played. Went for walks. - Mm-hmm. And did Daddy tell you I'd gone away? - Yes. - Did he tell you I'd gone for good? Yes, but not from you. Just from Daddy. I've taken a flat in London, so you'll be able to come up and stay. - Oh. - You'll like it there. There's lots to do. It's right in the centre. We can go to the pictures, and go to the zoo. We can go everywhere. Would you like that? - Yes. - Good. There's a picture show here tonight. Is there? What are they showing? - Laurel and Hardy. - Oh, marvellous. Do you like them? - What time do they start? - In a minute. You'd better not be late. So, er... Anyway, you'll come up to stay with me in London soon. And we'll talk some more, won't we? And you won't worry, will you? About all this. Okay. Hey, Tim? Doesn't Mummy get a kiss? MILLIE: "Even Simon, chirpy, cheerful Simon, began to tire. "So Pepito made a bed of grass and leaves for his little friends. "He covered them with his big, woolly coat, "and sang to them until they fell asleep, tired but happy, "after a long, long day in the magic woods." Hi! - How are you? - Fine. Charlie's asleep, at last. - How did it go? - All right. Teddy had taken him to his grandparents. They're trying to take him away from me. I know they are. - (KNOCKING) - They can't. I hope you're right. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi, Carrie. - I got the booze. ALAN: Millie, get your stuff, and get Charlie. We're going home. - No, we're not! - CARRIE: You followed me! 'Course I followed you! - You're coming back with me! - No, I won't! Come on! Ah, scusi. Did I hurt you? Would you like some help, maybe? Huh, sweetheart? Well, come on! Here, let me help you. Come on, you big he-man. Big boy, let's see what you can do. I mean, you're not afraid of some poor little coloured girl getting on top of ya, are you? Come on, I'm waitin' for ya! (ALAN GROANING) Did I hurt you? I'm terribly sorry. Come on, let's see what you can do, then. Come on, I'm waitin' for ya. Come on, come on, come on! Hit me! Big he-man! Millie! You wanna kick him in the balls? Break his arm, maybe? Or just get him the hell out of here? For God's sake, get him out of here, Carrie. (ALAN YELLING INCOHERENTLY) (FRONT DOOR CLOSING) God... Oh, Jesus, that was scary. Let's have a drink. (MILLIE SOBBING) TEDDY: Have that one on me. Don't bother. - All mounts up. - I can manage. Can you? Little lady at the agency was very cagey about telephone numbers. My... representative got absolutely no joy at all. So I gathered. But then, they're used to the odd pervert nosing around. I bet they are. I'd imagine they do a little bit of pimping on the side. Do you? Yes, you would. I'd also imagine that a judge could be led to the same conclusion. Would you? - Want to talk about it? - With you? No. I think you should. Let's go for a drink. I wouldn't go across the road with you. All right. There's a bar this side. I really do think you should. You're going to lose Tim, you know. - I don't think so. - I do. I've taken advice. So I gathered. Who are you using? Jackson and Gardner. They're awfully good. Well, you can tell your Mr Jackson, or Mr Gardner, or whoever it is, that, er... they'll be hearing from my solicitors. Solicitors or soliciters? My God. Have a nice day. MAN: It would be better if you faced the realities of your situation. You see, I don't doubt for one moment that all you have told me is true, but how do we substantiate your story? You see, your husband's solicitors, on the other hand, er... may be able to establish a damaging, admittedly circumstantial, case against you. One, you left the matrimonial home. Two, this Mr, erm... Hendricks, the photographer. Of course, I'm afraid I'm not familiar with his reputation. But, um... if, as your mother-in-law infers, his reputation is not entirely savoury... And, um... Miss Bernard, his friend... It seems probable to me that although your stay with them was entirely proper, if we are unlucky enough to get a stickler of a judge... Well, it could make a very bad impression. Yes, but they took me in. I had to go somewhere. Yes, but, you see, the judge might wonder, "Why not to an hotel?" Well, I was wearing practically nothing. I... I ran out of the house. Yes. Now, Mrs Shepherd, please understand that I am on your side. But I have to present the matter from all sides. Yes, I understand. Now, you are a fashion model. Correct? - Yes. - And you do photographic work - for Mr Hendricks? - Well, among others, yes. Er... Still photography, film commercials, whatever comes my way. Yes. Excuse me for asking this, Mrs Shepherd, but, er... I'm not entirely familiar. (CLEARING THROAT) Um... Does your work ever call for, um... er... for nude photography? - No, it doesn't. - Ever? At any time? I mean, you catch my drift. Well, er... some years ago, before we were married, I... Well, yes, I did do some magazine work. But it's not unusual. - Film stars have done it. - Yes, so I gather. Was your husband aware of this, er... work? - Well, it was before we married. - Yes. And your husband was quite unaware of all this? - No. - So he could, then, rake it up? - Yes. - Hmm. Now, this business of the branding iron. You called in the local police, and you were unable to produce the instrument. Your husband was sitting in a chair reading a book. He implied that you were given to hysterical accusations. Now, it is most unfortunate that you were unable to produce the instrument. Yes. You say he obtained it from an antique shop? Do you think there's any possibility of tracing the dealer? Oh, I... don't know. Possibly, but there are hundreds of them and my husband travels quite a lot. But the scar? He must be scarred. Oh yes, perhaps. He may have had it removed, it may have healed over, There's no way of knowing. If we sought a medical examination, and it proved there was no scar... Did you describe the instrument to the police? I... I don't remember. It had the letter "D" on it. My initial. Do you have any idea how he may have disposed of it? - No. - Mmm, pity. Great pity. Probably at the bottom of the river by now. Yes. Will you come to South Africa for your holidays? Yes. 'Course I will. Does it cost a lot of money? Yes, quite a lot. How long does it take? - What? - To fly? Ooh, about... I don't know. Daddy says we're going by boat. We'll have such a lot of things to take. Yes. There'll be a swimming pool. On the boat. There'll be a swimming pool. Yes. Well, you'd better hurry up. We'd better think about getting you back to school. Oh, careful! Don't knock me over. All right. Off you go.

We're looking for something. Well, bloody well pack it in! You're trespassing. I don't think so. - This is common ground. - (SHUTTER CLICKING) What about all those cars and paraphernalia in my drive? Oh, yeah. Well, we'll move those, if you insist. TEDDY: Yes, I bloody well do insist! I've a good mind to get a gun and pump buckshot into the lot of you. That, I think, would be assault with a lethal weapon. Would it, indeed? Not quite your behind-closed-doors style at all, is it? I don't need you to teach me the law, sonny. Yeah, well, why don't you just... just relax, eh? Move to the left a bit, eh? I'll relax you if you don't get your junk off my... If you're not off these premises in... They found it! DIANE: No, hang on to them. Marvellous stage management. Where'd you get it? The prop department? And these? Made for you at Sutton's. Taken out of my wardrobe. Get the damn locks changed. Oh, by the way, we found the antique dealer. At least, a private detective did. He says the man remembers you quite well. (SHUTTER CLICKING) TEDDY: They're mad. We'll be all right. DIANE: Will we? And the next time? You're mine! Tell me! Tell me you're mine! (DIANE SCREAMING) TEDDY: "Your mother's a whore, your mother's a whore." DIANE: Yet he was the most marvellous lover - any woman could ever want. - TEDDY: It's a branding iron. I had to have it. It's got the initial "D" on it. Come back! Come back here, you bitch! TEDDY: We'll be all right. Do you think, Mummy, you'll marry another man? Well, I might. One day. But what would you think if I did? Why don't you marry a racing driver? - Or a spy? - A spy?! - A spy would be good. - I don't know any. - You do! - I don't! I bet you do. Only they're secret. They never tell. Even when they torture them, they never tell. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
