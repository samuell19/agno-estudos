You can have Benny and Rod Strangeways round for drinks now. Of course. We should have moved in here right from the start. What would we have used for money, Joe? What? Oh, nothing. I feel bad about last night. That's very quick for you. Listen, love. Don't even think about it. I don't feel ashamed or anything. It's just. I always thought it was harder to make money. You know what you are, don't you? Puritan. Hello. Thatcher. Carol Thatcher? Yeah, she is. It's Tommy. How do you get your number? Hello. Hello, Carol. Great news. Oh, yes, yes, she's fine. Thanks. Listen, I've got a job for you this morning. Can you make it? No, not Mayfair. Super fashion job. A wedding dress. Great. Fantastic. Super. Right now. Same again. And at this time, stepping down. All right. Down. Marvelous. Right now, Carol. More or less the same thing. I want you a little bit bent. That's right. Bend over now as they are going to toss a posy. Lovely. Right. Magic. Hello, thing. Hello, Fruit. It's the girl. Carol Thatcher. No, seriously. Excuse me. Now, Carol. Back to the wall a bit. Mind it, Celia. Bad Morning. My name is David Singh. Mine's Carol Thatcher. Yeah. We can change that. David. You'll work for me this afternoon? 154 hours work and the prestige of working with Mr. Thing. I'm a bit busy. Could you busy. Cattle, please? Joe? Speak to my manager. Speak to my manager, Joe. David, Think what? May we get on with some work, please? This way, gentlemen. Well, four hours at 40 an hour. I make you just ?10 out. All right, then. 160. What do you say, Carol? 160. It's a deal. When do you want her? This afternoon. Out. How about tomorrow? Should we meet Mara? That'll be 160 now. Nudes. Is that wise? She's unknown. She's got it, though. Yeah, well, that's why we want. Her in it, though. Actually, Joe, I'd like to sign Carol up with you as her manager. Of course. Of course. Where did you find her? Fruit. Samantha. Oh, hold on, Joe. Excuse me. What is it? It's Philip Stanton. What does he want? You'd better speak. Hello. What is it? Hello, Joe. I've got another job for your Carol. Well, we're not interested. I thought it was a very good performance you put up the other night. Yes. I've just seen the rushes. What do you want? Well, actually, I'm doing you both a favour. It's ?500 for one night's work. What? Oh, no, no, not you, Carol. Alone and no filming. Yeah. No, no. She has to be very nice to. To an Arab sheikh. Just a minute. Did he tell you? ?500? But it's a wog. It's a She probably went to Eton. Oh, Joe, we're already getting two lots of 160. Won't that be enough? Joe, Look, you want this modeling thing to work for you to work well for you. You know I do. Well, another 500 could really set us up. Us? You and me. I'm your manager. Oh, I don't know. Look, it's not like the Battersea job. That was horrible. But as chic. Quite romantic, really. Okay. Just this once. Where? Well, it's a very big hotel. It's rather complicated, the whole thing. You see, he has six wives and 18 concubines, and they're all madly jealous. So he's arranged to meet Carol at the side door. And this is the plan? Oh. What floor are we on? Oh, Joe. Back with us. How about dinner this evening? Discuss the contract. We're busy tonight. I think she's a very attractive girl. I mean, the most essential. My wife should know that you can look in that book, see if she can handle. Where she is. Gavin Roberts. Gavin Robinson. Yeah. Yes. Wait a minute. Come here. Stand it. I leave the New Mexico. On Tuesday, I want to get ahold of this chick. I told you three hours, baby. She turns me off. Really? Yes or no? Desperately need her to model this year. For goodness sake. Who found her? All right. But I did. Now, come on. Have a straight away. All right. 400. Wonderful. Yes. Tremendous. Yes. Come on, Staten.

The Midlands. I'll put the cases in the bedroom, sir. What? Oh, thanks. Thanks very much. Will you be needing the car again tonight, sir? No, not tonight. About lunchtime tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Oh, that's all right. Joe can afford it. The rate you're earning, we can have it redecorated. Get rid of all this old fashioned stuff. Make it more like Tommy's place. How much is this place? Oh, hello. Good afternoon. I'm Mrs. Fraser. The catering company for the party? Yes, sir. If you'll let me know how many you're expecting, I'll get Mr. Fraser on to the job right away. Right. Typekit. Rod Strangeways is the real joker. Rod Strangeways. Is he here? My dear girl. Everyone's here. By the way, have you heard his chicken joke? It's written. And I can't believe all this has happened for you. I'm so pleased for you, my dear. Just a little bit of luck. A bit here and there. You're not kidding. You know, I don't care about helping them. Well, my dear, I had no idea you lived so close. My wife and I are just around the corner. How fortunate for periods of mutual relaxation. Yes. Excuse me. Oh, Prince. Charming, isn't he? Like him. Double spit. Wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it. Seen what? Like a fellow in the shop last month. So, butch. Well, that's Barry's trouble. Now. He's very big in the government. You must be very discreet. I've arranged Monday and Wednesday evening. All night. But he tired easily has a bad heart. I don't know. It's such a commitment. It's 400 a week. Last at last. So the Irishman opened the envelope and the instructions read. Don't forget to feed the monkey. Here's Carol. Oh, hiya, princess. How's it going? Oh, fine, Rod. We're working quite hard just now. So I hear. I'm going to grab a bite. Oh, try it, Kenny. Hey, Rod. Hey. Nice champagne, Mum. I won't say a word. There's Terry and Jonathan. Oh. Jonathan. Hello, Carol. Oh, Jonathan. Jonathan. Oh, hi, Carol. I. Enjoying the. Party. I always find these parties amusing. These people. Sad, really? You think money can buy anything? Perhaps they're right. I saw you on television the other night. You did? Very good. Very funny. Singing. You want to know something? Yeah. 1030. 38.5. 1030. 30. 300. Yeah. 350. Oh. He was. Oh, what a night. That was only the beginning. But the 2000s worth of business last night you booked for the next five weeks. What? Doing this and that. How much of that? Oh, there's a bit of muddling. Took on the cabinet minister and two others on a long term basis. Regular customers. More respectable, isn't it? It is. Really? Is that all we've got? No. There's another six bottles in the fridge. Money, I mean. Oh. Well, expensive party. Wasn't it worth it, though? Look at all these bookings. 2000 quid's worth. You're in the top bracket now, you know. We can afford almost anything next month. Let's take a rest trip to Paris. Joe. Are you happy? I mean, is this what you always wanted? No. Let's go home. What time do you pack up tonight, Carol? As if you care, boy. I do care. Can I pick you up? Nice car this time. Don't go scratching it now. As if you can. True. He got into a fight. With Yul Brynner. When you were in London with him that time? I would know. I hardly saw him when I was up there. See you tonight, then. I can't. I'm helping my mum. Morning, Carol. Busy. Always busy. No, Harry. You are going out with Tom Pender, then? What's it to you? You're not a manager, are you? No. Can be sure of that.
