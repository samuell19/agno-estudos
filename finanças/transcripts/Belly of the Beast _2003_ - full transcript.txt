[PEOPLE CHATTERING] [KIDS LAUGHING] So as I said, through our mutual friend in Burma, I thought maybe everybody could be understanding here. We just want peace. You guys have the whole of Burma. Stay there, leave us alone and tell my friend I said hello. JAKE: We respect him. We're staying out of his face. We run a really big operation here. Sometimes things like this, it happens. SUNTI: We've been doing business for a while. You keep your territory, we keep ours. This arrangement works. Right? War's never good for business. Yes, you're right. The last thing we need is an enemy in the CIA. Argh! Cross! [GUNSHOTS] [WOMAN GASPS] [GIRL CRYING] Help! Help! [GRUNTS] [SHOUTING IN THAI] Argh! GUARD 1: Yeah, it's all clear. GUARD 2: Check the front gate? GUARD 1: Done. Check the north side? Yeah. Done. It's clear. [DEVICE BEEPS] [DEVICE BEEPING] [BEEPING] GUARD 1: See anything over there? GUARD 2: I can't see nothing. [BEEPING] GUARD 1: I checked it. It's clear. [PHONE RINGING] Hey, Daddy. Hey, baby, everything okay? Everything's great. How are you? Hey, did you get the list I left you? Not yet. I can't believe you. Well, listen. Don't forget to feed the fish. And remember, Maria comes in on Wednesdays. And take care of yourself, okay? Don't drink too much coffee. Don't worry about me. Hey, uh… let me talk to Brice. [MOUTHING INDISTINCTLY] Dad, how did you know? Baby, when are you gonna understand I know everything? Listen, Daddy, I love you. Take care of yourself, okay? All right. Love you. Bye. What? Nothing. Shut up, asshole. My dad's the best. Come on, guys. We've got to go. The train leaves in two hours. All right. Let's go. Yeah, let's go. MAN: Watch out over there, man. BRICE: Yeah. All right. It's not like it's gonna break or anything! JESSICA: Stop that! BRICE: It's time for you to die. It's time for you to die. JESSICA: You're giving me a headache! [BIRDS CHIRPING] Heh. You all right? Yep. Okay. [BRICE CHUCKLES] Hey, um… so why didn't you tell your dad that I…? That I was coming with you? He's… He's protective. After mom died I'm all he's got. All right. He's a good guy. Like I hope you will be. [CHUCKLES] [ALL SHOUTING AND LAUGHING] [UPBEAT MELODY PLAYING ON RADIO] MAN [ON RADIO]: And now for the latest world news. Officials search for evidence after a bomb destroyed a police station in Thailand this morning. Fourteen military police were killed. General Jantapan of Special Forces SARA: Come on, it's so boring! Music! Assures the community no stone will remain unturned. BRICE: Music! JESSICA: Enjoy yourself! [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] SARA: Whoo! Yeah, that's more like it. [ALL SHOUTING AND LAUGHING] [HUMMING] [JESSICA SCREAMING] Oh, my God! No! SARA: No! Oh, my God! Out of the water. Quickly. [SOBBING] [SCREAMING] [MEN SPEAKING THAI] Hey, you can have all our money. It's not about the money. [GIRLS SCREAMING] No! Brice! [DOORBELL RINGS] Hey, Tom. Hey, Jake. Two days early. Listen, the agency know you're still using me? No. No, this is just between you and me. Well, let's keep it that way. Listen, there's something else. We got a tape today. What are you talking about? There's no two ways to put this. Jessica and the Winthorpe girl were kidnapped. You're kidding. Does this have to do…? No, no. Absolutely not. They don't even know who Jessica is. Well, is it money or…? We don't know anything yet. Well, is she okay? She's alive. MAN [ON TV]: The Abu Karaf can no longer not do anything when our brothers are tortured and oppressed. These prisoners of war will be executed within a week if our demands are not met. All members of the Abu Karaf must be released with full pardons. I demand an immediate response! They got a list of demands as long as your arm. We have a good relationship with General Jantapan. He favors direct action and is offering full cooperation. Gentlemen, I'm sure you all understand the sensitivity of the situation. We have to ensure this stays in the family. Nothing is released without my express permission. We must resolve this without harm to the girls or the reputation of the U.S. We agree fully. That's why I'm putting Agent Washington in charge. He's been operating in the area for four years and is more than qualified for the job. Leon? Thank you, sir. Ahem. The first picture you have there is the current head of the Abu Karaf. Name's Mongkol. Since he took over, they've become more hostile towards the government. The usual stuff. Ambushing police patrols, small rudimentary bombs. Anything like this before? Nothing, sir. Where's their money from? Arms, mainly. What about this Hopper guy? He's a good man, sir. It's a damn shame his daughter's caught up in this. Tom, didn't you work with him? I trained under him for two years in Southeast Asia. He's been out for 10 years, though. Where is he? He left Honolulu four hours ago. Lands in Sangoon at 6 a.m. Sit on him. If he starts making waves, pick him up, send him home. Yes, sir. That's all. Thank you. I got a plane to catch. DRIVER: Taxi service this way, sir. Come on. Right here. Excuse me, excuse me. This way, please. DRIVER: Your first time in this town? JAKE: No. Hey, where you come from? Uh… Far away. Far away will be England, right? Close enough. All right. If you need something, just tell me. I'll get it for you, you know. Okay. You know, this town, I'm telling you. There is the beautiful girls, like angels. We have those younger, sexy girls. We have a lot of bars here. Not only, we have a specialty massage here in this town. It's very nice here. I just need you to get me where I asked you, okay? DRIVER: Yeah, I'm going this place that you want to go, but I want to give you information about the town. If you like to drink some beers, we have young girls, look good, here, nice brown, black. You'll see, you'll love it. The ride is over. [THUG SPEAKING THAI] [THUGS SHOUTING] [WOMEN SCREAMING] [BOTH SHOUTING] Argh! [IN THAI] [THUG GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [THUMP] [BOTH SPEAKING THAI] [IN ENGLISH] How long will you stay? A week or two. How would you like to pay? Cash. Okay, would you please sign your name? [SPEAKS THAI] SARA: Hiyah! [GIRLS SCREAMING] JESSICA: No! No! Come back, you asshole! Fuck you! Open the fucking door! Don't go! Fuck you! Fuck you. SARA: Come back here! [CHATTERING] MAN: You know my situation. JANTAPAN: Yes, sir. It's become an international issue, and I'm under a lot of pressure. I understand, sir. It's my men that are being killed by the Abu Karaf. We're working with the CIA to finalize plans. Just make sure you don't act without consulting me. We can't afford to upset anyone else. Yes, sir. Don't let this get out of control. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [CROWD CHEERING] [LULU SCREAMING] [SPEAKING THAI] [MAN SPEAKING THAI] Ah! Ah! He won't leave me alone. What's your problem, junior? Asshole, you calling me a junior? Huh? You look like junior. Oh, you think you're tough, huh? She's paid for, so it got nothing to do with you. I work for club, not you. What you mean, you work for the club, bitch? You work for me. Why don't you go back to your own genetic puddle and go for a swim, boy. So you think you're tough, you walking in here, huh? [SPEAKS THAI] [BONE CRACKS AND MAN SCREAMING] [BOTH GROANING AND COUGHING] You all right? Yeah, I'm… What's going on? Get out of the way. What's going…? Jake. We've got to talk. Let's go have a beer. My old buddy, Jake Hopper. So, what's up? You here on business or…? I got a little problem. That's not like you, Jake. Mr. Clean. No, it's nothing like that. It's Jessica. I'm afraid she's been kidnapped. What do you…? I mean, where? Well, they say it was the Abu Karaf up north, but, uh, I don't know too many Muslims to be up there, so something's funny. What do they want from you? I don't think it has to do with me. Jessica's friend is the daughter of Senator John Winthorpe, and I think maybe that's what they were after. Shit, man. I'm sorry. Listen, Fitch, I've been out of the game for 10 years. I need some goddamn help. Listen, man, I mean… I'm not on the inside anymore, you know? I've got some contacts. Um… Yeah, I'll check it out. They've been giving this government a serious headache. Do the best you can, you hear? I'll do whatever it takes, Jake. [TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] Excuse me. Jake, right? Yeah. I want to thank you for what you did. Oh, you're welcome. Where are you going? Back to the hotel. - Which hotel? - Songwat. Oh. Well, maybe we could get something to eat. Something nice. Yeah, but I'm not hungry. Thanks. [GRUNTING] Mom… I want you to find Dad. We're gonna need his help. I love you, Mom. [KIDS SHOUTING] [GIRL CRYING] Help! [GRUNTS] Argh! [GIRL CRYING] [MONKS CHANTING] [CHANTING CONTINUES] [SPEAKING THAI] Brother, I haven't forgotten my English. You're looking very good. Thank you. Must be the haircut. And how are your wounds? Better. And how is your heart? Healing nicely. I haven't forgotten that day, Jake. I'm very, very proud of you. You stay a full monk for 10 years… Really, really wonderful. Then again, I think you're the lucky one, because your life is simple. Simple is good. Simple is very good. I wish I had simple in my life right now. Jake, I'd like to think you came all the way out here to see me, but I don't think so. Is everything all right? It's Jessica. She's been kidnapped. What? By who? Well, they're saying the Abu Karaf, but I don't think so. Is there anything I can do? Your prayers. I'm going to go see Paijan Paitoon. [SPEAKING THAI] [JAKE SPEAKING THAI] [BOTH SPEAKING THAI] [CHATTERING] How are you? Good. How was your flight? Long. Very long. You must be exhausted. Come. Have some tea. Sure. We've got a unit of Rangers that can mobilize whenever I say so. But I need Intel, bad. This is a preliminary report. It covers what we know of the Abu Karaf and their known locations. I don't have the resources to deal with this for you. I fully understand, and we'll offer whatever you need. I'm very grateful. Until there are dead bodies, my priority is the girls. Of course. I'm sorry that these animals have involved such innocent children. You have to eat something. I'm not hungry. You need to eat to keep your strength. We have to stay positive. I know my dad's gonna do something about this. He can't help us. He can't. You don't know my dad. SUNTI: For 10 years, I have pledged my life to atone for my past. This is my life. But now going back on this road, I have great trepidation. If you walk this road, you may not come back. I will take with me everything you have taught me. It is your choice. Thank you, master. [LULU SCREAMS] What are you doing here? I come to bring you food. Did Fitch put you up to this? No. He does not even know I'm here. Okay. Sorry. Am I disturbing something? No, not at all. Come in. And she is? Lulu, a good friend of mine. [SPEAKING THAI] Hey, thanks for the food. Okay? I'll call you. What are you doing here? I gave back my vows. I'm here to help you. You need to leave now. I've spoken to Master Paitoon. He understands. You'll screw up the last 10 years of what you've done. I don't want you involved. Jake, you know I'll do anything for you. I owe you my life. Brother, listen to me. You don't owe me anything, but thank you. Listen, I may have a lead for you. A man by the name of Fernand Zadir, a French Arab. Who is he? Algeria originally, then France. Been here 15 years. Started in furniture but moved up to bigger stuff. Bigger stuff meaning arms. Yes. And you know who runs most of his business? Abu Karaf. Exactly. Let's do it. [THAI INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] SUNTI: That's Fernand Zadir. He's got half the local police in his pocket. The other half likes eating here too much to bust him. JAKE: Who's that girl? Her name is Lena. She works for someone rather big. Well, let's find out how big. I want to talk to your boss, huh? Please, sit down. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKS ARABIC] What can I do for you? I was wondering if you could pass on a message for me. Who to? To the Abu Karaf. What business have you got with them? Probably none, but some say they had something to do with the kidnapping of my daughter. Are you sure? I'm not sure at all, but I thought we should have a meeting and straighten things out. Well, that is very unfortunate, but I'm afraid I cannot be of any help. Pass on the message. [TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] Hey, Fitch. How you doing? Jake, how are you? All right. How are you doing? All right. Lulu, come here. [LULU & JAKE SPEAKING THAI] I'm gonna get you laid if it kills me. Ahem. It's not what I had in mind. What do you got? I've got a guy coming in from Singapore, says he did business with the Abu Karaf. When's he coming in? Says he's busy. Two days. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Well, listen, did you ever hear of a guy called, um, Fernand Zadir? No. You sure? Sure, man. I can find out. You do that. Okay. Yeah, man. I will see him to the door. Yeah, you do that. Jake, I need to talk to you. About what? I can't tell you here. There's something I need to tell you. Fitch lied to you about Fernand Zadir. How do you know that? He does know him. I have seen him at the club. What else? Nothing. I have just seen him. I've only been working there for three months. So, what are you doing here? I have some personal problems with my daughter. Oh. How long will you be staying here? I really don't know. Hm. Listen, uh, there's something I want you to do for me. [TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [FAX MACHINE RINGING] "Bridgeport"? "Sang Kom train yard tomorrow." FITCH: Yeah. How you doing? All right? All right, keep going. Good, good. All right, I'll see you in a bit. Heh, heh, heh. I got to check on this air conditioning. [LINE RINGS] Yeah. You did what? If the boss found out you sent it via the fucking fax, he'd kill you. Don't be such a fucking idiot. Of course I won't be there. Go by yourself. Be there at noon. I thought I could come with you. Okay. Go home. Jake. Yeah? Be careful. [MAN 1 SPEAKING THAI] [MAN 2 SPEAKING THAI] [SPEAKING THAI] [IN THAI] [IN ENGLISH] Hey. [SCOPE CLICKING] Okay. Somebody up there about to snipe Mongkol. If I let him do that, I could lose the only link to my daughter, and I can't let that happen. If I shoot him, a whole world of trouble's gonna come down on us. You know that. Yeah. Here we go. [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] [SPEAKING THAI] [SCREAMING] [SIGHS] [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] [SPEAKING THAI] [CHATTERING] [JAKE SIGHS] [SIGHS] Some men were killed today. You are responsible. I know who you are. Okay, so, uh, what would you like me to do? Mr. Hopper, you disturbed an important anti-terror raid. That's not true, and you know it. Maybe a few days here will help you understand. Our hospitality is famous. I think that'd be a big mistake. No, Mr. Hopper. You made a big mistake by coming here. [COPS SPEAKING THAI] [SPEAKING THAI] Wait. Hold it. Captain, tell your men not to do anything stupid. [SPEAKING THAI] Let him go, Jake. JAKE: Leon, Leon. My daughter's rotting somewhere in a goddamn hole. Do you expect me to get with your program while they're jerking our chains? You won't leave alive without me. Do you hear? We'll see. Jake. He's coming with me. [SPEAKING THAI] [COPS SPEAKING THAI] I'll take full responsibility. Next time I see you, I put a bullet in your head. Go for it. Key. I'll contact you later. I'm taking you to the airport. Leave this to us, Jake. Leon, you look smart. We can do this the hard or easy way. How you want it? I hope you're not threatening me. You know me better than that. Listen to me. This is my daughter. What that means is, anybody who stands in my way, it's gonna be them or me. I don't want you in a body bag. You ain't gonna have to worry about that. [SIGHS] You got something else to say? I won't be here the next time, Jake. Ah. [SIGHS] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] SARA: Help me! Jessica! Jessica! No! No! Ahh! No! No! LEADER: Stop! Boss needs her. She killed my brother. Get the body out of here, leave her alone. MAN: Get up! LEADER: The time will come. [WHIMPERING] Jade, I'm home. Jade? [LULU SCREAMING] [GASPING] SUNTI: They killed her roommate, and your hotel is full of police. This place is safe. [SIGHS] We've got to find this guy Fernand. You think he set up Mongkol? No, he'd be screwing himself. I'll see what I can do. I'll meet you back here. Thank you, brother. You need anything? No. Is there any chance anybody saw you go into the office? No. It's just… Just Jade. It was horrible. There was blood everywhere. JAKE: I'm sorry. It's my fault. She was so strong. [SOBBING] It didn't matter what happened. She… She never complained. And now they're gonna come for me. No, you're with me. You don't have to worry. You're with me. You're not always going to be here. Well, I might not always be here, but you can be with me as long as you want. Okay? Don't leave me. I won't. [GRUNTING] I'm sorry, sir. Leon had Hopper released. Things like that happen, captain. Hopper will have his day. Hold out the apple, captain. Sir, please, I can explain what happened. Closer, captain. There was nothing I could do. I said, closer. Closer to your head! [PANTING] If this happens again, you will be the apple. Yes, sir. Fernand Zadir met with Hopper. Soon, Fitch will do the same. Silence them. SUNTI: Fernand uses this place when his shipments come into town from the river. [ENGINE STARTS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [MAN 1 SPEAKING THAI] [MAN 2 SPEAKING THAI] [MAN 3 SPEAKING THAI] [GRUNTS] [MAN 1 SPEAKING THAI] JAKE: Sunti, are you in the mood for a dance? Ah! Yaah! We were too late. He was all we had. No, no, no. I don't think so. Sooner or later, they'll slip up, and when they do, we'll get what we want. You think they'll come for you? I pray they come for me, because then we'll find out where my daughter is. [FOOTSTEPS] [MEN SPEAKING THAI] SARA: No! No! Don't hurt me! Get off me! Jess! This is a final warning. We will execute them within 76 hours if our preliminary demands are not met. [SCREAMING] SUNTI: Where are we going? JAKE: Fitch is all we've got. [TIRES SCREECHING] SUNTI: What…? Is this woman cra…? [HORN HONKING] JAKE: Wait here. [CHATTERING] [MAN SPEAKING THAI] [MEN CHATTERING] [MAN 1 SPEAKING THAI] [MAN 2 SPEAKING THAI] [CHATTERING] SUNTI: Is he gonna offer you a deal? I don't think so. Then what does he want? I don't know and I don't care. And what brings you to this part of town, Mr. Hopper? As you know, I'm here to find my daughter. And I'm still looking for my money. I understand that, but I can't help you. If I had your daughter, you wouldn't be here. I believe you. This may be a long shot, but, uh, who was that woman at the train yard? Why should I trust you? Let me put it this way. One of the kidnapped girls is the daughter of Senator John Winthorpe. You do not want a bunch of these black-op boys coming in here and tearing up your world. Her name's Lena. She works for Bridgeport. It kind of seems to me like maybe she's setting you up. I think you're right. You know they're gonna manipulate the CIA into believing you're a threat. Thank you for saving my life. Nothing personal. For me, it's all about the girls. I'm just here for those girls. FITCH: Hey, buddy. Heh. How you doing? Great. How are you? You know, Fitch, you ain't nothing but a trailer-park bitch. I think I figured it out. You lost out on the heroin out of the north. It all went to the Chinese in the triangle. You lost out on the Abu Karaf in their arms dealing because, hey, they're Muslims, and after 9/11, well… So you orchestrate the kidnapping of two poor little innocent girls. Then you enlisted Thai Special Forces and the CIA to crush your business competition, but you made one big mistake. You kidnapped my daughter. You done? Good, because I just wanna say, Jake, you're a fucking dog. You're gonna die right here and your body's gonna rot in a hole, just like Jessica's. I suggest you put your gun down and tell us where his daughter is, okay? Uh-huh. The general's taking really good care of her. What do you think of that? LENA: Great. I like this one. I want him. Well, you're not my type, but, hey. You enjoying this? Good, because it's the last thing you're ever gonna see. I liked you much better as a bitch. [BOTH GRUNTING] Are you enjoying it? Jake, this is between you and him. Please don't kill him. FITCH: Jake, give me a break, huh? For old times' sake. I'm just… You know, I'm really confused. Didn't you just say I'm a dog and I'm gonna die in this hole, just like my daughter? Sunti, this is not a good man. What are we gonna do? It's not like I can take him home to Mama. [GRUNTS] I guess he, uh, sealed his own fate. It came from the president's office 10 minutes ago. Do you think we're doing the right thing? [SIGHS] I don't think we have any options, sir. What about the girls? Senator Winthorpe wanted more time, but the boss has made up his mind. [PHONE BEEPS] Hi, Shirley. Get me Leon. [PHONE RINGS] Yep. Yes, I think it's for the best. I can have Colonel Rose mobile in 12 hours. Did you find Hopper yet? Still nothing, sir. Listen, Hopper's a joke. A washed-up old man. I'll take care of him. Sir, did you know a Fitch McQuoid? Sure. He's retired, right? He was found dead in his club three hours ago. Stay in touch. [PHONE RINGS] LEON: General, my people have decided to move forward as planned. I understand. I'll let my officers know. You're doing the right thing, Leon. [IN THAI] [IN ENGLISH] Be careful. I'll be fine. Listen, I've been thinking. Not that anything would happen, but in the rare event that, uh, I don't come back, this will be enough to tide you over for a good while. The phone number of my good friend Tom Collins is in there. You call him. All right? LULU: Keep it. I will be waiting for you when you get back. [SPEAKING THAI] [IN THAI] [SPEAKING THAI] [ENGINE STARTS] Time to go. All right. [DIALING PHONE] You got both of those? Yep. [PHONE RINGS] Yeah. JAKE: Leon. How'd you get this number? Abu Karaf don't have my daughter. You know that. But Jantapan does, and I think you know that. Going to get the girls. Thanks. Wait a minute. Hopper. Shit. [SILENCED GUNSHOTS] [MEN SPEAKING THAI] [WHISPERS] Clear. [MEN SPEAKING THAI] [MOUTHING INDISTINCTLY] JESSICA: Get us out of here! Let us out! Please! [ALL SPEAKING THAI] [CRYING] [GUNFIRE] [GIRLS SCREAMING] [ALL SPEAKING THAI] [SARA SCREAMING] JESSICA: No! SARA: No! Stay here. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GRUNTS] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GRUNTS] You might defeat me, but you cannot defeat the magic. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GRUNTING] Ah! [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [ALL CHANTING] [CHANTING CONTINUES] Ah! [CHANTING CONTINUES] Ah! [CHANTING STOPS] It's okay. It's your father. You can come out now. Hey, come here, baby. What'd you think, I wasn't gonna come and get you? Thank you. We did it, Jake. That we did. Ugh! Sunti. [BREATHING HEAVILY] See you next time, Jake. [GIRLS CRYING] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] SOLDIER: Move in. Go, go, go. Wait, stop. Stop, all right? Put your men at ease. [SPEAKS THAI] [SOLDIER SPEAKING THAI] [MONKS CHANTING] Goodbye, brother.
