An alien armada has arrived and invaded our planet. Wave after wave have attacked us with a ferocity never seen before. To battle this new threat, the Power Rangers must master the abilities of the legendary rangers, to become Super Megaforce! So, this is it, huh? Yeah. You know, I really enjoyed working here. But it's time for me to move on. Well, whatever it is that you are off to do next, good luck. You know, I'm going to hang this up on the wall. Like when sports teams retire a player's jersey. I am going to miss you, Orion. Uh-oh... I would better go, put this in the laundry. Hey. Hey, Emma. Come on. Everyone else is waiting at your ship to say goodbye too. This planet is such a happy place. One day, I hope mine will be like that again. You know, when I first came here, my home was gone, all I could think about was revenge. But then I met you guys. I learned so much from you. Emma, are you okay? I'm just really going to miss you, Orion. We all are. Don't be sad because we have to say goodbye. Be glad we got to meet in the first place. Okay... I'll be glad we got to meet. Right after I'm sad for just a little bit longer. Troy. Gia. Emma. Noah. Jake. Orion. Oh! Whoa! Man, these Armada ships are really amazing. I mean when they're not trying to destroy us. Someone's in nerd heaven. Noah, come on. So, you're really leaving, huh? Yeah. Now that the Armada is decimated, it's time for me to head back home and start rebuilding my world. Well, we got you a going away present. Uh, there's some snacks in there and a few mementoes of Earth. And... I thought you could plant this on your world. So, you'll never be too far from your second home. Wow. Thanks, guys. I'm gonna miss you all more than you could possibly know. I owe you guys a lot. Noah, you showed me the importance of fighting with your head as well as with your hands. Gia, you showed me that you could be tough, and caring at the same time. Jake. You made me see that even in the most difficult times, you can find some humor to see it through. That's why everyone loves me. Except some really stubborn people. Emma. Your empathy helped heal the scars of losing my home. Thank you. And Troy... You taught me the most important lesson of all. How to be a Ranger. I want you to have this. Ah, I couldn't. Just keep it for me. Till the next time we meet. Safe travels, Orion. Till the next time. Bye! Here we go. Whoa! That's amazing. Steady! Bye. Have a safe trip! He knows how to fly that thing right? Careful, careful, careful! Sorry! Bye, guys. It's been amazing. Well, there he goes. Goodbyes are always so sad. Come on. How about we pay a visit to Ernie? I'm sure he can use some cheering up. Could use some myself. I know, buddy. Get you a fro-yo. Troy's buying. Wait. What? I'll never forget them. Okay, auto pilot, take me home. What are you doing, Tensou? Trying to contact Orion. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Tensou, wait. Tune in that frequency. And set a course for Earth! The real invasion begins now! Real invasion? Tensou, the Armada is on the move. We need to warn the Rangers. What is it, Gosei? Rangers, you must come to the command center, right away. You got it. Gosei, what's the situation? We intercepted this transmission just a little while ago. I was trying to reach Orion! All Armada forces, across the galaxy, this is Emperor Mavro. Terminate your missions immediately. And set a course for Earth. The real invasion begins now! Who's that guy? That's the voice I heard when I was captured. He's the one that came up with the idea to use me as a bargaining chip to get the Earth to surrender. Oh, no! Emperor. He said, "All Armada forces across the galaxy." Exactly how many are we talking about, anyway? Could be hundreds of thousands. I have never heard of a mobilization this large. This situation is more serious than you can imagine, Rangers. Emperor Mavro is Vrak and Prince Vekar's father. He has a massive fleet at his disposal. He's incredibly powerful. And Orion just left. There's just the five of us now. No, it's not just us. Look around you. All the Rangers who came before us are here too. And they entrusted us with their power. Because they believe in us. So, really, we are not just five, we are over a hundred all fighting for Earth. Yeah! Let's get out there in the Sky Ship, so we don't lose a moment when the Armada gets here. I believe in you, Rangers. Right. Your Majesty, your forces are on the way, and eager for destruction. Congratulations, Your Majesty. With the whole fleet here, it's only a matter of time before Earth falls. How dare you even address the Emperor! Considering your massive failure! What? Don't pretend nothing happened! Do I need to remind you that you're one of the three bumblers who failed to protect our beloved Prince Vekar? Once we've conquered Earth, you're going to be punished. And your sentence will be severe. But... The time has come to prove your worth. Otherwise, you will be doomed along with this planet. Yes, Sire. Keep your eyes peeled for any signs of the Armada. We don't know how long we have until they get here. This new Megazord is my greatest invention ever. My masterpiece. With it, I will finally avenge the Prince and redeem myself in the Emperor's eyes. Those Rangers won't know what hit them. It's payback time! Huh? It's a Megazord! It looks like Levira. Then let's do this! Zords combine! Legendary Megazord. Ready. The Rangers will finally meet their end at my hand! Let's hit her hard! Your pathetic Megazord can't compete with my superior technology. Take this! Inferior scum! You won't derail my brilliance! I hope you're watching, Your Majesty. She won't beat us! Let's pump up our strength! Let's go legendary! Ninjazord. Combine! Legendary Ninja Megazord. Ready. It's not enough! Try to overwhelm her! Ninjazord. Activate. Ninjazord, attack! Ha! Like I haven't thought of a countermeasure to that! Let's power up! Ultimate Super Mega Cannon! Fire! Whoa! Systems... Overloading... We can't let up now! Blinding aura strike! No! We almost have her! I won't lose! Quick! We need to stop her now! Red Lion. Combine. Legendary Samurai Megazord! Ready! No! Samurai strike! I'm not done yet. Whoa! She escaped. Curse you, Rangers! Have the courage to face me! Don't stay in your Megazord like cowards. Fine by me. Let's go! No more inventions to save you now! Let's finish this, guys! Royal Guards! We are here by order of His Majesty. We will assist you. Well, I hope he doesn't expect me to thank him. Hiding behind back up, huh? Just evening the odds, Rangers! Not that I'll need their help to destroy you. I'll never stop until you're gone! Quick! Legendary Ranger mode. Mystic Force. Mystic Shield! Follow my lead! Yes, we have to end this before the Armada shows up. Legendary Ranger mode. Mighty Morphin mode, red! Blitz mode, black! Prism mode, green! Lightning mode, blue! Supersonic mode, yellow! Super Megaforce! Red's mine. Prism Shooter! Blitz Blaster! Supersonic Lute! Lightning Rod! Power Sword! Attack! I refuse to let you stand between me and redemption. You don't deserve to be redeemed! Redemption comes from changing who you are on the inside! Nonsense! Hi-ya! This new mode is loaded with power! And I'm gonna make the most of it! Supersonic Lute! Sonar Blaster! We need to finish off these Kingsmen and help Troy! With these two rods I'll take this guy down, double time! Lightning Slash! Nice, Noah! Give me a second and I'll handle this guy too! Alley-oop! Griffon Magma Galaxy! Prism Pulse! Prism Gauntlet activate! Prism punch! No! This can't be happening. Not now! Yeah! Good job! Now wait for it. Rangers, let's use the Super Mega Cannon before she has the chance to regroup. Super Mega Cannon! Think again! Activate! Super Mega Blast! What? No! I can't fall yet! I was supposed to achieve greatness! Emperor, use my maximizer! Don't forsake me! Goodbye, Levira! You bought us the time we needed. Now, those Rangers are doomed, no matter what! Uh! Yes! One less bad guy to worry about! Yeah, now we can finish off the Armada. Right. Huh? What was that? Look! No... Way... There's so many... Mr. Burley, you got to come outside and see this. I am right in the middle of... This had better be important... Oh! Okay... It's important... And really, really scary... What is that? How can anyone, even the Rangers, take on all of those? Every ship in the Armada's fleet. I thought Gosei said there might be thousands, there must be millions of them! This is beyond anything I could've imagined. What's wrong, Rangers? Just look at them, did they really think we would let them defeat us? We rule the entire galaxy! Rangers, I am Emperor Mavro, the leader of the Armada. Face it! You cannot hope to stand against a force of this size. Oh, no! Stay strong, Rangers! My fleet will grind away at you until it achieves the inevitable, your defeat! Save yourselves from this pointless struggle. End your futile defiance. There's no way we're gonna leave the people of this Earth defenseless. We'll never give up without a fight! We need to send this guy a message. You thinking what I'm thinking? Is this enough of a message to get our point across? That's what I'm talking about! It's morphin' time. Go, go Megaforce! This is our answer... Earth's defenders never surrender. Very well, Rangers! Then you have doomed yourselves and your entire planet. Go, go! Into the Megazord! Let's power up! Super Mega mode. Summon Sky Ship. Zords combine. Legendary Megazord. Ready. Good thing we still have the Q-Rex, too. Hit 'em fast and hard. Don't give 'em a chance to counter strike. Nice, Q-Rex! Ha! The Q-Rex has been hit! No! There are too many! Then we need more of us too! Of course, we've got our own fleet! Our legendary zords! Good thinking, Gia! Super Mega Cannon! Delta Motor Emergency! Red lion, descend. Ninjazord, activate. Star blazer! Megaforce Zords, activate! Animal spirits, full fury! Yes! A few thousand down! Nice. Let's use our RPM powers. Turbo Falcon, combine! Legendary RPM Megazord. Ready! Hang on tight, guys! Thanks, Turbo Falcon. Okay, guys, now let's tap into our mystic force powers. Legendary Mystic Megazord. Ready. Guys, let's lead all of our legendary zords into battle. Look! I can even auto pilot the Q-Rex Megazord. It's working! Mystic Dragon, join the other zords in the fight. Now, legendary battalion mode. Firestorm, strike! Earth, one. Aliens, nothing. Is it safe to come out now? Oh! Ah! Way to go, Rangers! Keep it up, you guys! Impressive. But their tricks all amount to nothing. Their legendary powers are no match for our newest ships! Better check the comm links. Second wave advance. We will crush the Rangers' spirits. Then crush them completely. Soon, this planet will be ours! Just like the rest! No... What? Where did all those come from? Attack! Watch out! Huh? The Ninjazord's down. Mystic Dragon, no! Delta Runner! Look out! Red lion! Turbo Falcon, behind you! They took down all of our legendary zords! Now, take them out! You guys okay? I think so. Uh-huh. That was too close. Well, come on! We gotta get back in this fight! Let's show these humans the price of defiance. No! Nothing compares to the thrill of crushing your enemy. Yes! People of Earth, hear me! I am Mavro, Emperor of the Armada. We control this entire galaxy. Only you and your Power Rangers dare to resist us. But it's over! We've won! Your Power Rangers have been destroyed! And you are all next! You have one last night to savor your despair. You will regret defying us. Tomorrow at dawn, we are coming back. To finish you! Bigsley? Bigsley? Someone help us! We're stuck in the elevator! Can anybody hear us out there? Please help! This man's hurt. Don't worry, guys, we've got this. Everything seems fine. You're gonna be okay. Oh, okay! Thanks. Bigsley? You found him! Is he okay? Here you go. He's all right. Thank you. What's your name? Danny, and this is Bigsley. Nice names. Danny! Mom, he saved Bigsley. Help! We're trapped! No one can hear us. Hello? Hold on. We'll get you out. Come on. Here, take my hand. Don't worry, you're safe now. Help! Help, help! Somebody, please help me! Grab my hand, it's okay. I'm here to help you. I can't. I'm scared. Hold on to this. Come on, that's it. Great job. Careful. I got you. Emma! Emma! No... Jake! My leg! I got it. I'm fine. How are the others? I don't know. Let's go find them. Emma! Gia! Come on. We need to look for the others. Come on. Okay. Who's going to save us, now? We're all doomed. The planet is done for. I can't believe the Rangers are gone. Maybe they survived. Mom, are we gonna be okay? Are the Power Rangers really gone? I don't know, sweetie. The Rangers are probably out there fighting for us. So we have to hope, we have to believe. Noah! Guys! What a relief! I'm sorry the Zords were lost. How is everyone? We've been better but we're doing okay. This is our darkest hour. But I have faith in you. Gosei, the girls are now here. We'll speak soon. I was so worried. Me too. We walked through it all. People are wondering about us. They think we're gone. They still have hope. They believe the Rangers will come and save them. And save the world. How are we supposed to do that? We lost all our Zords. We are completely outnumbered and outarmored. The Earth is in a desperate situation. But the people out there believe in us. Gosei believes in us. The past Rangers believe in us. Or they wouldn't have entrusted us with their powers. They all believe in us for a reason. Because tomorrow morning, we'll be there for them. We will stand tall and we will fight. And we will win. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. What was that? We better find out. It's an Armada ship. Orion! Guys! Hey, hey! I can't believe you're here! Man, I really need to learn how to land this thing. What're you doing here? I heard about the invasion on the communicator. You guys didn't think I'd let you do this all alone, did you? What's the plan? We fight back. Mommy! Mommy! Hope you all had a good night because it was your last. It's time to crush you into dust. You still think you can stand against us? Take aim! Open fire! What? Up there! Look Mommy, it's the Power Rangers! So, you fools are still around, huh? But not for long. Wrong, this planet is ours and we'll never surrender. You really think you have a chance, don't you? There's no doubt at all. Big mistake. All of you, get somewhere safe! All right, guys, time to clean house. Take 'em out, guys. Let's mix it up! With pleasure. I'm ready to slice and dice! Catch me if you can! Surprise! Troy, watch out! Bruisers! Thanks for the heads up, Orion. Now, back me up! Final strike! Super Mega final blast! Right! Legendary Sixth Ranger mode! Kingsmen! We need more power! Legendary Ranger mode. Mighty Morphin green. Troy, use my Dragon Shield. Thanks, Orion. Just the power boost I need. Legendary Ranger mode. Mighty Morphin'! Let's do this! Final strike! What? Where did you get this new strength? It's been with us all along. You just gave us a reason to find it. Now we're taking you out! Yeah! Bring it on! Final strike! Super Mega Saber blast! Super Silver Spear! We almost got him! You think so? Did you really think I was on my own? I've waited long enough! This planet will fall! My patience has reached its end. And now, so have you, Rangers. Fighting this guy isn't gonna end this war. We have to take down the Emperor himself. But how can you get to him? A two-man strike force. Yeah! And I know just the ship that can get us there. Then what are we waiting for? Now you're easy pickings. Can you four handle this on your own? Ha! Count on it. We'll do whatever it takes! Just go for it. All right, good luck. Orion, let's go. Yeah. All right, guys, we got this. So your friends ran away, huh? Right where you belong! On the ground like worms! Don't bother getting up, you're finished! Wrong again. We're just getting started. It is good to have you back, Orion. No place I'd rather be. The shields are holding, but not sure how much longer. Take that ship down, now! Can you land this time without crashing? I'll try. Yeah. Shield's down, brace for impact! Hull breach. Sound alarm. Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Troy, we got company. We need to get to the bridge. What? Someone made it onboard the ship? What's going on here? Not so fun when you're the one being invaded, huh? Take 'em down fast and get to the bridge. This ends here and now! I want those intruders stopped now. Nothing will stop me from conquering this planet. What? Impossible! Rangers? On my ship? I told you I'd come back for you. Is that supposed to frighten me? You two are so pathetic, I don't even need to stand to defeat you. Let's put that to the test. This is for my planet. Now you understand why I rule an empire, while you are inept fools. See? You both are nothing. Super Mega Gold! You're wrong. Never again will you do to another planet what you did to mine. I do whatever I please. And nothing will please me more than crushing you. Wait, what are you doing? You're so proud of your fleet. Get away from there! I'll hold him. Let's see what happens when its full power is unleashed. What? No! How can this be? Quick, while he's distracted. Together! Super Mega Cannon! Not if I blast you first. Hold on. We can do this. Super Mega Blast. No, Emperor, forgive me! We got him! Yeah. Now it's up to Orion and Troy. They can do it. I know they can. Yes, ha-ha! It's over, Emperor. Your fleet's gone. That was a big mistake. No. Trying to conquer our planet was. Power is destiny and yours is to lose. Now I will force you to watch as I destroy your planet. But first, you'll pay! Yes. Stay down. Never. Super Mega Final Strike. Go ahead. I'll just send it right back at you. Orion, blast the console. Right. What? We'll take you down with you ship. Even if it means we go down, too! No! For Andresia! Troy, let's finish this. Yes, it's time to finally restore peace to this galaxy. Super Mega Blast. Impossible! Yes! Troy, Orion, no! Troy, Orion, no. Wait, look! No way. Are you okay? Man, you guys gave us a scare. We did it. It's over. Wrong again! It's only over when I say it is! I've survived far worse than that pathetic attempt. Hundreds of worlds, countless enemies have fallen before me. And now you will be added to the list of the defeated and forgotten! Guys, I say we give it all we've got. Hit him with all we've got. Yeah! I will crush you! Rangers, power up! Super Mega mode! Super Mega force red! Super Mega force yellow! Super Mega force green! Super Mega force pink! Super Mega force blue! Super Mega force silver! 'Cause defenders never surrender. We can't afford to hold anything back! Let's go all out! Every power. Every mode we've got. Legendary Ranger mode! Operation Overdrive! Squadron! Mega Force! Block him up! Green Samurai power! Aquitar Ranger power! Terra grip! Power Bow! Pathetic! Fire power! Battlizer Gauntlet! Battle Booster! Finally a solid hit. Keep it up! Let's do it! Legendary Ranger mode. Had enough? I don't even have a scratch! Legendary Battlizers! Jake, take the lead. No problem! S.P.D. emergency! Here we go! Jungle Fury! Magi Bolt! Samurai Shark attack! Troy! Right! Power of six! Yes! Despite your best efforts, you cannot defeat me. My power is greater than yours. And I will crush you with it! You choose to use your power for evil. And because of that you will never triumph! Good always wins. Final strike! Super Silver Spear! Super Mega Saber blast! That should do it! No! How is he still standing? Fools! I am invincible! Wrong! No one's invincible! What? We will defeat you! No! Go for it, guys! This is for my homeworld! We've got you, Orion! Super Mega blast! You may have defeated me, but you won't defeat my army! What army? Over there! What? X-Borgs. There's thousands of 'em! No way. There's more? This can't be happening. How can we defeat an army this size? One more fight, guys. This is it. Hey, guys. Look over there. What's going on? Noah, who're they? Legendary Rangers, real ones. Look, over there. Wow. Mighty Morphin. And Zeo. Look, I see Turbo. Incredible. Lost Galaxy. Wild Force. Dino Thunder. Lightspeed Rescue. Mystic Force. Jungle Fury and Ninja Storm? And Samurai. They're all here. Here they come. I knew it. I've dreamt about this. Hey, guys. Tommy! You don't have to do it alone this time. We're here to fight by your side. You've more than lived up to the legacy we've left for you. We're all very proud of you. Thank you. It's an honor to meet you. Ah, the honor is all ours. Why don't you take the lead? Ready, guys? It's morphin' time. Go, go, Megaforce! I love being a Power Ranger. Ready, Rangers? Time to create a new legend. Awesome! I never thought we'd get to fight alongside the actual Legendary Rangers! Seriously. I'm so pumped up I don't even need to power up. Hello, old friend. Glad to be back. Nice, Wild Force. Hi-yah! We can finally win this war. They're dropping like flies! I'll swat down a few more. Everyone, bump up the power! Use your special attacks! Don't have to ask me twice! Snake Ax! This is it, guys. Let's end this for good. Super Mega Final Strike. Charge! Mega weapons, combine! Megaforce Blaster. Ready. Dynamic victory charge! Super Spear Blaster. Yes! Now that was legendary. And we have some new friends to thank for it. Come on! We can't thank you enough. No. Thank you. Earth is safe again. It was an honor to fight by your side. Well, it's time for us to leave. We'll always be with you. Thank you. It's really over. We did it. Yes. Yes! Look at the sky. I forgot how blue it is. Without all those Armada ships. This is incredible. I still can't believe you guys took down the Emperor's ship. Man. I didn't think you two were coming back. To be honest, neither did I. What happens now? We go home. Seriously. This day cannot get any better. Come on. Come on, guys. Come on.
