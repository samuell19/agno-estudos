When I read this book, which is a rather accurate transcription of a criminal case, I felt very strongly that this so-called gangster world, in which the characters are struggling and getting bogged down, was actually overshadowed by childishness. That the goals and reactions of the heroes never got beyond the childhood stage. That their brutal games were barely childhood games, and that the extreme absurdity of those games could only lead them to death. Chaos is Life- Night is what there is before and after Life. Nora, would you have dinner with me tonight? You seem nervous, Chevrel. Thanks. You know I don't smoke. So? What are we going to talk about? Excuse me, Nora, I have to make a phone call. - Is Fred there? - No, he's not. - I really must speak to him! - Maybe, but he's not here. - Is he coming tonight? - I don't know. Tell him not to go before I... It's getting cold. It's me again, I'd like... It's okay, he's here. - What's wrong? - Oh, Fred... It's the third time I've called. I thought I'd never reach you! What's happening? It's bad. A guy has been following me since this morning. - What kind of guy? - Average-sized, slim, dark-haired, with a light-colored raincoat. Anything more precise? It could be just anyone. I think he has a scar on his left cheek. I think I know who it is. - Who? - Tito Mascani. - A killer, Chevrel. - What should I do!? Where are you? At the Dome. - Alone? - No, with somebody. - Who? - A colleague from the lab. - Her name? - No, I can't tell you! - The name of the girl! - Her name is Nora Riviére. - Address? - 32B, Rue Vandamme. Chill out. You're safe where you are. What if Nora wants to go? - I'll call the boss. - When can you be here? In half an hour. She can wait for half an hour, can't she? - I hope so. - Otherwise, let her go alone! But stay at the Dome at all costs, understood? Understood. See you shortly. - Is that you, Wanda? - Hello, honey are you gonna be there soon? Not that soon, actually. Can you put Eric on? - Yes, Fred, I'm listening. - It's Chevrel... Sasha put Tito Mascani on his tail. - So he's brought out the big guns. - Precisely. - It won't take long with Tito. - Where was Chevrel calling from? From the Dome. He's with a girl who works at the lab with him. He invited her because he was scared shitless alone. Her name? Nora Riviére. She's living at 32B, Rue Vandamme. You're gonna contact Chevrel at the Dome, without letting the girl see you. Tell him to let the girl go home. Then you take Chevrel to his place and you wait... for Waldo with him. Waldo? Better not let Chevrel see him. He won't. He'll find a way to let you know he's there... and he'll take care of Mascani. You just have to stick with Chevrel. Tito won't make a move as long as you're there. Got it? - Yes, and afterward? - Waldo will let you know... once Tito has been overpowered, then you can go. Are you leaving, Fred? Yes. See you tomorrow night. You look like someone with troubles. Hey, don't you think you've got the wrong car, dude? Don't get angry. We won't hurt you if you behave. I guess you won't mind if we take another car. - You're scared, Chevrel. - Shut up, you're talking nonsense! Let's go. I really have to come with you. - That guy... - Don't bother about him! But he's bothering about you. He's following us. You don't need to get out of the car. I'm leaving now. Nora, please don't leave me! What do you want me to do? Let me come to your place. You're insane! Pierre, it's impossible. I won't bother you. - It's impossible, Pierre. - Nora, if you leave me alone, - you're condemning me to death. - Come on, stop your melodrama! I'm not joking. The guy following me is a killer. He's been paid to kill me, you understand? - And why would he kill you? - I can't tell you. Then I'm sorry, but I can't believe you. I'm sick of it... Sick of everything. Even sick of me? Maybe. Nora... I'm giving up trying to make you understand. I'd just like you to let me come in for a few minutes, - to write a letter. - A letter? Is it serious, Pierre? Yeah, quite serious. Then, come in. But you'll have to leave once the letter is written. Go away, Pierre! This letter, don't read it. Don't open it. Give it to the police if you don't see me again. Go away, Pierre. - Oh, Miss Nora! - What's happening? Don't you know? They found a dead body in the blind alley. Stabbed in the back. They don't know who it is. Nothing in his pockets, nothing identifiable on him. I heard they took him to the morgue. They're asking questions to the janitors to check... if he was from the neighborhood. No one recognized him so far. - Police. - What do you want? Don't be afraid. We need you to identify... a man murdered in your street last night. We have reason to believe that man is Pierre Chevrel. - You know him, do you? - Yes... - He spent the evening with you, yesterday? - Yes. And he took you back home? We'll interrogate you later. First, we have to identify the body. Would you mind coming with us? Where to? To the morgue. It's unpleasant but essential. All right. Let me get my bag. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. This isn't the way to the morgue! Where are we going? Be careful, it's dangerous! The job worked out pretty well... Waldo. Stop it! You take the wheel. You'll pay for this, Waldo! I wasn't hurting the girl! What do you think Sasha will do to her once we foist her on to him? Shut up and drive! - Where do I take her? - To the blue room. Eric's orders. Leave it, Boris. Hey, kid, want to become a bargeman? I've brought you something from the Gipsy, Mr. Sasha. Really? Let me see. - Things always turn out alright. - Yes, sir. You can tell it to your buddies. But I want regular deliveries. Not just as the Gipsy wishes. - I'll tell them, sir. - Okay, beat it. Margief & Co also hire trainees! You're so tough when you're not on your own. Keep it shut or I'll bust your face in! You do know how to gather intellectuals around you! Cut it out, Fred. Keep your show for the boring evenings. Don't go thinking you're so smart, Sasha. Eric's not gonna like your behavior. I'm his brother, remember? Precisely... That gives me an icebreaker to talk with that bastard. Eric will never accept it. Not him, nor the other ones. What other ones? The real big shots. You'll never be one of them! A big shot must be a man first! What about your brother and his music? A trafficker can also be an artist. That gives poetry to the profession. Before I dumped him, your brother always... regarded me as a nobody. He enjoyed humiliating me. - You were eating, thanks to him. - But I had bad digestion... Until I understood I could sail on my own. Then sail away and don't bug other people. I can't sail away until your brother grants me some concessions. There's room for everybody. You forget that we all used to work together. We used to. Yes, Fred... But now, I've become ambitious. There's no reason why your brother should have all the market. I want half of his territory. - Nothing less. - Eric won't share! That's not how he is! Especially with you. I know how to make him accept. He's not made of steel. No one can destroy in one day a 12 year-old organization. Not even a little immigrant who dreams he's bigger than he really is! There we are... You've finally said it. That's why you've always hated me. Because I'm an immigrant. A nobody to you. And so I want my revenge. To make you remember. "Russia is spiteful." - That's a commercial title. - But now, I'll keep my word. I'll get through this, by all means. - And I'm gonna get him. - A heavy schedule! You'll need a lot of breath. Eric Wolff's reign is about to end. The best shows always come off eventually. And guys like you always end up as puzzles for coroners eventually! That's it, Fred. I'm not gonna argue with you. Eric is the one I want to speak with. And you'll stay here until we reach an agreement. Otherwise... Adios, Freddo. No more kid brother. Get the picture? Close the window, Wanda. - Can I speak to Eric Wolff? - Who's asking for him? - That's not important. ls he there? - One moment. Hey, that was a woman's voice. Do you know her? Yeah, you even look like you know her well. How is she gonna react if we bring her your corpse? Is that you, Eric? I just want to know if you're willing to become more understanding. I've got plenty of time... but your brother doesn't look so well. I've got some good news for you too. We busted Tito Mascani at Chevrel's place. Did you sleep well? Not very talkative. What do you want me to say? You won't answer my questions. Try me. Why have I been brought here? That's true; you're awfully indiscreet! Who's playing? Eric. He can play for hours. I'm taking you to Eric. He asked that you come down. - Can you walk? - Yes. It's gonna be all right. - The young lady is here. - It's okay, Wanda. Leave us for a moment. Come closer. - Are you Nora Riviére? - Yes. N--- - I wanted... - Yes, Nora? Why did you bring me here? I can't answer you yet. Go back to your room. Why did you talk like that to Sasha? It's not gonna fix things! I don't want to fix things. How are you gonna get Fred released? - Stay out of this. - If anything happens to him, my life won't be long enough to make you pay for it fully. I love Fred as much as you do. He's my brother and there are things between us that men can't forget. For the moment, Fred isn't in danger. - Why are you crying? - Leave me alone! How are you? - Do you want some coffee? - If you want. - Are you hungry? - No, thanks. Coffee is fine. How long are you gonna keep me here? Why? Are you bored? Do you feel lonely? Can I take the tray back? You've been assigned to my service? Don't go thinking I'm the maid! Yet you do look like a maid! Stay where you are! - You're scared. - You're not here to ask questions. - Don't move. - You're touchy and... you're lacking in self-control. It's annoying in your profession. - You filthy bitch! - If you aren't scared, forget about this. If you want to keep the next few hours quiet... You have no right to confine me. - If you don't set me free, I'll... - ...Ask for help from daddy's connections? - You should tell that to Eric. - I want to speak to him. Oh yeah? Maybe you want to tell him you have claustrophobia? That being confined is bad for your complexion? Then you're not risking much. - What's your name? - Wanda. An unusual name for a servant. - What's wrong, Wanda? - I'm getting fed up of playing maid... - to that bitch! - Someone has to do it. Why me? Another great idea of Eric's. If you want, I'll go for the tray tonight. OK. But don't tell Eric. He'd be mad. "If someone is reading this letter, that means I'm dead... "and nothing will matter to me anymore. "That's why H! try to tell all I know. "For almost a year, I've been working for a gang of drug traffickers. 'Within this gang, I only know one man. A man called Fred, "who I met in a bar on Rue Mouffetard. "He was bringing me the opium, hidden in beer cases. "I was extracting the morphine... "and performing the synthesis of the heroin. "Two days ago, I received a threatening letter from Sasha Margief, "who wants to take over the trafficking. "I didn't reply (o his offers. "A man called Tito Mascani has been following me all day. "So I asked a colleague, Nora Riviére, to go out with me..." Am I bothering you? What do you want? Only to know when you're gonna call Margief. Why are you worrying, Waldo? I don't like having that girl in the house. We have to get rid of her as soon as possible. I don't intend to keep her for long. I'm gonna call Margief. - I've come to pick up the tray. - Stay where you are! Are you afraid of me? I'm not gonna hurt you. The others want to, but I don't agree with them. Aren't you wondering what you're doing here? Take the tray and go away. What if I offer to help you? Do you know what they plan to do with you? They took you as a hostage... and plan to trade you with Sasha Margief's gang. I don't understand a word of what you're saying! Why are you waiting? We can't move in broad daylight. And it's best not to give that bastard too much time to think about it. He's gonna try to get us, anyway... Maybe not. He doesn't have much to gain. If he takes the time to think hard about it... But why talk about that, Waldo? You're right. There's no need to talk. I've never been lucky with girls, but you, Nora... Let me go! I'll get you out of their hands, but be nice to me. What do you have against that girl? Nothing... Nothing, yet. Let me go! Be nice to me, Nora! I'll get you out of their hands. You bastard! What's that moron doing? Maybe he's on an interesting trail. Couldn't he phone? I think it's important. Tito got busted; that's enough. He thinks he's alone in the world and surrounded by enemies. That's not Martin's style. He's a stand-up guy. Hi, Tito. - Where's Fred? - I don't know. Beat me if you want. I don't know where he is. Where was Fred taken? I don't know. I wasn't there. - I was following Chevrel. - Ask him where Margief is. I'll give you some encouragement! - Excuse me. - You did it on purpose, you filthy bitch! Behave, baby, or Waldo won't have to fight for your honor anymore. Slut, you're gonna be sorry for that! - He didn't say a single word. - And he won't talk. He knows what to expect if he turns Margief in. He prefers to let us do him in. We can't kill him. He's our hostage. - We've got the girl. - That's not enough! Fred's life is in his hands, and his life is worth two regular lives. Still, I'd be glad to get rid of him. You'll soon get the chance to get rid of a lot of people. There's someone out in the hall, walking slowly. Check it out, Waldo. That's someone trying to be stealthy. Don't come any closer! Or I'll shoot! Eric, watch out! She's gonna shoot! I don't think so. Are you crying'? That's Wanda's revolver! Where's Wanda? Go have a look. I think she's dead. She tried... She tried to scald me. How did you kill her, Nora? I don't remember. I don't know. That's true, she killed her. Unbelievable... With her angelic face! - What are you gonna do, Eric? - The same as we planned. I'm gonna call Sasha. For that, you'll need his number. I'll ask Tito. You can be sure he'll give it to me. What took you so long? I did my best. The girl disappeared and the cops are there. - The cops? - They probably reported the girl's disappearance. Bad news for us. They'll make the connection with the discovery of Chevrel's body. Where can that girl be? Why didn't you shoot Eric? - One cannot shoot a blind man. - Only because of that? For what other reason? The power of Eric... He has something special... A power that can't be explained. I'm wondering... ls that you, Sasha? - How did you get my number? - Tito, of course. A charming boy And very helpful. What's next? It's all simple. What do you plan to do with Fred? I haven't changed my mind. You'll get Fred back if you accept my conditions. But maybe I'll be the one dictating the conditions from now on. What do you mean? I have Nora Riviére with me. So, what do you say'? Just spit out all you've got to say. If I hand over Mascani and the girl to the police, they'd tell a nice story about Mr. Sasha Margief... His underworld activities and murders. That might be very bad for your standard of living. H! trade the girl for Fred. With Tito as a bonus. With no other conditions. If you refuse, I'll hand them over to the police. That's my final proposal. OK, I accept. - When do you want to do the trade? - Tonight. The sooner, the better. - Let's say around 2:30. - Where? Maybe around the Verriére woods; they're near your place. Then listen to my instructions. So? Take Nora upstairs. I'll explain to you afterwards. No. No, I'm afraid! Don't be afraid. It's part of the profession. What you say is terrible! We'll resume this discussion later. It's gonna be fascinating. What time is it, Waldo? - Almost midnight. - Fine. Take her to the chapel. She won't see Wanda. No! I know what you two are gonna talk about. Rif told me. I know why I'm here. - You're using me as a hostage! - Take her away, Waldo. What kind of man are you? You play music as if you had a soul and a heart... yet you have no mercy on me. - Mercy? - Yes, as I had mercy on you! Mercy on me?! I don't need anyone's mercy! Take her away, Waldo! I'm fed up with that girl! - What's wrong, Waldo? - I'm the one asking questions. What are you thinking about? This situation, and I don't like it. I wanted to use the girl, but I feel like it's Sasha who's calling the shots. What did he say? Nothing, but his blood is boiling. We're gonna meet in the Verriére woods for the trade. Did he suggest that place? He did, but that doesn't change anything. Anyway, if he plans a set-up, he can set something up only after my phone call. And we were looking after the girl! This bastard thinks he can get to me like this... and I'm gonna return his bro for nothing! Maybe you were wrong, Sasha. - Better not overstep the line. - What line? There really is a line! Eric Wolff thinks he's the great Fuhrer of dope! And I'm saying there's not enough room for the both of us. I'm about to destroy his organization. - First, we have to get the girl. - And we're gonna have her! Don't you realise you're wrong? You can't use Nora anymore. She knows too much about us. If you hand her over to the cops, she won't do you any favors. I don't like your mentality, Waldo. There's no doubt... l'm really starting to think I'm right. You're in love with that girl, who you've never even seen. I think we should out it out now. But me...? I don't need her alive. While Fred... Eric wants him alive. Can you see the difference? Go get me Fred. A party in the Verriére Woods is scheduled for tonight! We meet at 2:30. Go to the Taniére right now... and bring Victor and Marcel over here. Be sure to be here at 2 with the guys. All right. Did you see, Eric? What I'm planning for him? I'm gonna give him a hard time. If you really were a man... A big shot... Eric would have been at your mercy for a long time! I couldn't, Arlette. You know it. I didn't have the means. - But now I'm Eric's equal. - What if he wins? No... That can't be. He can't be the winner all his life. It's my turn now. We'll move from the barge, afterwards? Don't you like our barge? Why "our barge"? It's true, you can't understand. For me, it's something else. This country's never accepted me. It's funny... Here, even the mobsters are xenophobic. Well, my Cossack, got a depression crisis? You're a funny little creature. Why funny? Because I've figured you out? Because for me, you're just a big bad wolf? You're so young. Young! Young...! You think one can remain young, with this never-ending fear? I'd like to be able to go to the market, without looking back. To be sure you'll be there when I come back. Go to the movies... The life of a shorthand-typist! You'll get all that... And possibly more. You really think so? - Hello, Waldo. - Hello, Lena. I waited for you yesterday at closing time. - Why didn't you come? - I couldn't. Eric needed me. Always Eric. You're nothing but a slave to him. Don't talk nonsense. Will you come this morning? We're rehearsing until 6. Maybe... I don't know yet. - What's with you tonight? - Nothing, why? You look strange. ls it true that Fred fell into Margief's paws? Who told you that? - Marcel. ls it true, Waldo? - Stay out of this, Annie. - Where's Marcel? - In the office, I think. I need him. And Victor? I haven't seen him tonight. You're taking Marcel with you? - Yes, why? - I'll be on my own if there's a hard blow. There're never any hard blows on closure days. - I'll call Marcel. - You fancy ballerinas? This one is interesting. She's out of the ordinary. - Where does she come from? - Oh, that's a mystery! Marcel's discovery. She's good, isn't she? As if she had done that all of her life. There can be callings, even in here. Hello. Come with me. What's up, Waldo? Where's Victor? Got the flu. I sent him home. We'll go get him. What's wrong? I'll tell you later. We've got no time to lose. I've got no choice. There's nobody else handy. - And Rif? - I'll tell you later. - Close the club until I'm back. - ls it that bad? Yes, it's bad, Marcel. Got it? Let's split. Where are you, Nora? Here. You're beautiful, Nora. I know it. I'm never mistaken. Listen, I'd like to tell you what's going on. What? That you're trading me, like a hostage? You're severe and definite. - Go away. - No! It's not possible. What's not possible? To remain alone downstairs while you're up here. I'm a big girl and I'm not afraid of the dark. I'm sometimes afraid of the dark. Sorry, Eric. My brother is being held hostage by Margief. A madman, a maniac. He had Chevrel killed by Mascani. And you know Mascani. Margief would give anything to get you. And me, I just want to get Fred back. Margief is going to kill me. Maybe not, but... I shouldn't have touched you... Heard the sound of your voice... Discovered that you really existed... Now, it's too late. - Where's Eric? - In the study. I haven't killed him. Can't you hear him playing? - I'd like to make a phone call. - At the end of the room, on the left. Thanks. 20 ABREO. Sasha speaking. What do you want'? Just to be sure your guys will be on time. They're on (heir way. - With Tito and the girl? - I'm a man of my word. Yeah, that's what they say. - How much do I owe you? - One call, 50 Francs. Thank you, sir. - Not so fast, we've got time! - The sooner it's over, the better. My word, you're driving with your hunting permit! - Where are we going? - To the Verriére woods. - You know the place? - Yes, I do. You've probably been there on a picnic. Weapons out. Right, Alex. Things are going as planned. Go give them the agreed welcome. Riquet and Sm must have med Fred by now. They'll give you a hand. - But try to take the girl alive. - Aren't you taking one of us with you? No... There's no need. I know Eric is all alone. Otherwise, he wouldn't have answered the phone himself. Are you afraid to die, Riquet? Look at me: I'm calm. Yet you don't take me to the dance! Give me the machine-gun. Here. Take this, Nora. Put it in your pocket. - You think they're already there? - Certainly they are. What are those scumbags doing? Fred is dead, Eric. And by now... all the guys you sent to the Verriére woods... must be dead too. I'm gonna shoot you down, Eric. And that will be the end... of your drug racket. Don't you think you should have tried to get along with me? Maybe. If you believe in heaven... then say one last prayer. For you, the curtain is coming down. That's what I'm gonna do! - Are you hurt? - No. - Victor? - Dead. I was alone. - That was horrible! - It's over, Nora. - I was so afraid for you! - Chill out now. "Chill out", that's easy to say! Leave it - it helps me. You can't understand. You're used to it! Me, it was as if I wasn't myself anymore! Stop it now! Let me go! You're hurting me! That's more horrible than anything I could imagine. What's horrible, us? - Yes. - You wanted it as much as me. That's what's horrible. Leave me alone! What's going on here? I'm here. It's over. - I'm here! - Nora... It's over. Don't say that. You'll live a long life. I'm done for... Too bad that... I couldn't tell you... all that I wanted to tell you. It's too late. One way or another... you were lost to me. But... as you're here now... I've no regrets. One must always... pay for the good moments. We're together now, don't worry. And tomorrow... Tomorrow... Tomorrow... The night... The night... I put Wanda's body with Margief's. Why? To save you some trouble when the police are questioning you. You think the police will buy your staging? If they have no proof, there's nothing they can do. - Where are we going now? - To Mormont Station. You're taking the first train to Paris. Why? Can't you drive me there? I've got my reasons. And you're gonna tell me what I have to say to the police. Tell them the truth! Except for one detail... You never saw me. I have no reason to cover up for you. You'll do as you want. We should say goodbye to each other now. The hardest part is to finish with you. I don't care about all the rest. Before, we played out our lives side by side. We hardly have a bright future before us, but if you were up to... I think I'll stay with you. What's the matter with you? I can't take you. Sooner or later, I'll be... I'm staying. Nothing matters anymore for us. I was stupid to ask you to stay. If I'm arrested, you'll be treated as an accomplice. That's a certainty. Who was Eric? - What's wrong, Waldo? - Get out... I've got a rear light on the blink; go have a look. Translation and timing: Aquasantajoe Revision: Lordretsudo
