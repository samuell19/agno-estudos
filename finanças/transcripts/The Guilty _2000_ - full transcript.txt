Corrigan, 84971, you're free to go. Guard: Open for prisoner release. Hey, Corrigan. We got a message for you. - What message? - Your mommy called. Said she was sorry she couldn't make it. She had to go to work. Get in! - So how was it? - It was beautiful, Dennis. I'm thinking about going back next year. Whose car is this? I got you a job if you want one, same place as me. No, I'm good, man. I've got plans. - What plans? - Venezuela. I met this guy inside, he was telling me about this oil rig. So I figured that I would get myself a passport, a little cash, and a ticket out of here. All I need is a start. Where do you get "starts” from? Is it yours, Leo-- the car? Stolen. You picked me up in a fucking stolen car?! Leo! Dennis! Are you kidding me? I feel a little bit of a crash and dash coming on. What are you doing, Leo? Stop the car! Stop the fucking car! Leo, pull over! -I can't see! - Leo, pull over, now! Oh, shit! Come on, fellas. Let's get some booze! Yeah! Party! Stop the truck! Hey, Leo! What are you doing? Put it away! - Put that fucking shit away! - Look out! Corrigan: What are you carrying for? Leo: I didn't hit anyone. Don't be such a dink. Are you kidding me? I just got out of fucking jail. Six months for ripping off a few cars. Big deal. Don't you ever do that to me again. You hear me? It ain't like it used to be, honey. It never was. Smoke a joint. Let's go, Dennis. Man: Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... Justice. What is it? And what is it worth? In a libel case like this, we have to put a value on it, though of course, it's not just about money, and never has been. There's a speech I remember being made to learn by heart at school. Time to find a new assistant. Are you sure that's the quotation? You left it on your chair. That's not what you tell Mr. Crane. Crane: It's Shakespeare: "Who steals my purse, steals trash, 'tis something, nothing, 'twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands. But he that steals my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes me poor indeed.” He's the senior partner in the firm, which means after me, he's the most important person you'll meet. Remember the way; you'll do this a lot when he's got a gig on. I saw him on the news last night talking about the Russell case. Should end today. Crane hasn't got a hope. All Selena's going to be getting is his bill. Selena Russell was bankrupt in every sense after that newspaper article appeared. It finished her career. And as you've heard, she can't get on a plane. She can't go into a restaurant without people thinking, no, believing-- that she's nothing better than a common prostitute. Is that justice? No, it's a human crime. And for what was this crime committed? A tabloid newspaper article, 22nd read on the nation's toilet. Is that justice? My client's reputation is her career. And her career is her life. And her life is in ruins. I ask you a final time, is that justice? Well, if not... you tell me, how much is it worth? Where is that little shit, Miles? His ass is fired. Sorry, Mr. Crane. I've got to be honest with you, she lost it. You're a fortunate man, Miles. I remembered it... just. How in the hell did you win this one? I got lucky with the weather. Here's your fan mail, sweetheart. I've got to get back to work. - Only two? - One is a parking ticket. Thanks, Aunt Maddy. Yeah, thanks, Mom. It was great. What's that? Uh, my birth certificate. What do you want that for? I told you, Mom. I'm getting my passport. You're not serious about that oil rig thing? Yeah, you tell him. It's a stupid idea. You can still rip off cars during the weekend. Nathan. Give it to me. I'll get your passport. Nope. You lost the last one. Let's go! It's a good thing I had time to clean up, huh? Hey. Dennis: What's up? -Mom...? - Nathan-- Mom! Please don't lie to me anymore. I met your-- I mean, Martin, when I was pregnant with you. How come you never told me? Hmm? I wasted my whole life listening to you. It was your mother's decision. My whole life, you've been telling me what to do. I adopted you. I gave you everything you wanted. Criticizing me... - preaching to me. - You ungrateful... You never loved me! Do you know what? You're not my father, and I'm glad. Corrigan: I never felt like I belonged here with him. But I might have a family somewhere. Your family is here. Half of it. His name is Callum Crane. He was a law student. - Does he know about me? - I never told him. Why not? He was very... ambitious. He wouldn't have wanted to be held back by us. Maybe if you would've told him, things would have been different. Not necessarily better. He's not the answer to your problems, Nathan. He won't want to know you. He better. Reporter: Fashion model Selena Russell, at the city courtroom this afternoon considerably richer than when she went in. $2 million dollars is one of the largest settlements awarded this kind of case, and is a personal victory against the odds for Callum Crane, one of the country's leading criminal defense attorneys. And in other news tonight, a fire broke out down-- That's the last bottle. I have to get up next week. Will they appeal? I would if I were them. I may even suggest it. One day, Callum, your genius for getting the guilty off and winning undeserving lowlifes vast sums of money, will be punished-- I hope. I bet I make federal judge before you. You're a devious, amoral hypocrite. Exactly. Give Natalie my love. She prefers diamonds. - How is she? - Who knows? She's asleep when I leave and asleep when I get back. For all I know, she never gets up. See you tomorrow. Drive carelessly. Callum: Ahem...! You scared me. Sorry. What are you doing here? Having a great night out with my friends, Mr. Crane. What are you doing here? This is my first day and Miles said he was breaking me in. Leave it... and I'll give you a ride home. Are you sure, Mr. Crane? You can call me "sir. What do you want to drink? I'm buying. Drink? Whiskey sour, double. So what about you? You don't want to be one of our secretaries your whole life. I don't want to be one of your secretaries at all. So what do you want? An easy job which pays very well with absolutely no skill or education required. - Such as...? - Miles'. Though I think I'm well overqualified. Are you married? I'm really not sure. Are you? What do you think? I never think unless I'm paid. Are you trying to get me drunk, Mr. Crane... sir? No. Why not? Do you mind if we sit down? I'd rather watch you fall over. I thought the idea was to get me drunk. Yeah, I know. What are you trying to do? Take advantage of me? I haven't decided yet. I think the milk is bad. Whoa. Aw, shit. I'm sorry. No. Why? You are married. You are drunk. You are my boss. You take your pick. You want to. Don't. Not anymore. No. No! No! No! No! Sophie? Sophie. Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I'm so drunk. Leave! Just leave. Natalie: Callum? Is that you? No. ( Piano playing ) Shut up! How dare you speak to Faith like that? She's practicing. Why isn't she at school? Why aren't you at work? I'm not going in for a while. I'm taking a vacation. Well, I'll be glad to help you pack. What is wrong with you, Callum? Anyone would have thought you'd lost that case. Yeah. You're going to have to go in sometime, Sophie. I'm thinking about getting another job. It took you months to get that one. You can still go to the police. I don't want to talk about it. Do you want me to do something, then? Tell me his name and I'll report him. I keep going over how it happened. I led him on, Tanya. I'm so stupid. You said no, and "no" means "no. Don't let that bastard get away with it. Your ex-husband is here. What does he want? Damn, he's early. - Faith, Amy, Daddy's here. - We're coming. Let him in, would you, Callum? And don't mention work. Why not? He got fired this week, along with half of the agency. Giles. Callum. So, how's work? - Natalie didn't tell you? - No, what? Daddy! - Hey! - It's so good to see you. Pick me up! Can we go for ice cream? - How's my little princess? - No, let's go swimming! Oh, Callum, someone called Miles phoned... he said you have to go to the office immediately. Let's stay up real late. Why? What else did he say? Faith! What's this urgent problem I had to come in for? You've got a meeting with the CEO of Trans-Pacific starting... 314 of an hour ago. Where is he? On the conference room ceiling. Thank you, Miles. Look, about the other night-- I'll take the stairs. I'm a little unhappy, Miles, about the efficiency in the office, the atmosphere. Would you say that it's all it needs to be? Um... no. I was wondering. And that new secretary? Sophie. Hm-mm. What do you think? Difficult to say. I'm not so sure, either. Obviously, it's completely your decision. You think maybe she's, uh-- Well, like I said, it's completely up to you. I thought maybe you and she were... No. No. Right. I just wanted to get your opinion. Fired? You're still on your trial period. No warning necessary. Why? What did I do? Call in next week to pick up your paycheck and clear your desk. What do you want? What do I want? Harassed, propositioned, raped and fired in my first week, what more could I possibly want? Exactly what I've given you, a fresh start. You know how bad I could make things for you? How? You don't have a chance of proving anything. Since the other night you've been let go, so any fuss you make now is gonna look like cheap revenge. Plus, you're getting a month's pay, which is very generous. If I were your lawyer, I'd really have to advise against taking any action. I'm glad we could talk. No, no, he isn't. Hold on, he just came in. What are all those cars doing outside? You've totally forgotten, haven't you? Forgotten what? Most of them are your friends. Oh, God. - Who's this? - The Department of Justice. Have you been a naughty boy, Callum? Hello. What has two thumbs, is French, and loves a blow job? Moi! Brent: Callum, are you all right? No. I'm a federal judge. A judge? You made federal judge? I don't believe it. Neither do I. Somebody down there likes me. To you. Do you ever look at the sky and think there must be something up there controlling our destiny? No. Neither do I. So, what happens now? I finish this bottle and fall over. Then next week |I get sworn in and start controlling other people's destinies. It's a funny life. This all happened so quickly. One minute you're a drunk, earning millions of dollars a year lying to judges, and the next minute, you're the judge. Not exactly how I would have put it. But the amazing thing is, I've actually gotten away with it. Gotten away with what? Oh, everything. Dennis: Leo, answer that, will you? Leo? Leo? Dennis, I'm going to the city. - I'm going to try and find my dad. - Well, that won't take long. I got his work address, so it's a start. Tell my Mom I'm sick or something. You are. By the way, I borrowed Leo's car. That was nice of him. Well, I was hoping you could break it to him, sort of-- gently. Nathan! ( Knocking on door ) Hey. Excuse me... Tell Leo we're looking for him. Tanya? She's not picking up. Yeah, well, we're going to be late for the open house. Hey, Tan? Can you do me a favor and pick up my paycheck for me at the law office? Sure, when? Well, they're expecting you. - Well, where are you going? - To see a man about a job. - What job? - His. Um, excuse me. Yeah, hi, I'm looking for-- I'm looking for Mr. Crane. Mr. Crane doesn't work here anymore. Could I get his home address? He's a federal judge, for Christ's sake. I'm not giving anyone his address. Yes? Look, sir, this is really important. So is this. A paycheck for who? Sophie Lennon? Yes, send her to accounting. Look, if it's that urgent, he'll be in tomorrow evening. You can come back then. ( Cellular telephone ringing ) Hello. Oh, hi, Conor. No. Oh, which house? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? What? Are you okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Oh, God. Is it okay? Nope. Oh, God, your car. My insurance! I have to call the police. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want-- I don't want to bother the cops. I mean, unless you do. But, your car? Don't worry about it. It's a-- it's a wreck. I'm not gonna claim. You mean it? Yeah. Thank you so much. I'll give you a ride. Yeah? - Wherever you were going. - All right. I was actually headed down to Mexico. Excuse me? Yeah, it's the first day of my vacation. I was driving down to Mexico. Oh, no, what have I done? - Is that true? - Complete lie. I was going for a drink. It's been a long day. Okay, but I'm buying. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Callum. Behave yourself. - Judge. - Well done, Callum. Glad to have you with us. Couldn't have happened to a nicer person. So this horse walks into a bar, and the bartender says, "What's with the long face?” I'm sorry you got stuck with this one, sweetheart. I'll take over. I hope you can stand the drop in the income. I'm sending the children out to work. That'll be the strip-o-gram. Natalie: That would be typical bad taste, - like all your jokes. - What's wrong? - They're terrible. - They grow on you, though. How is everything? Fine. You? You know, ever since our little chat... I assumed there was nothing I could do. You being a lawyer, you're paid a fortune for twisting the truth. Like you said, it was your word against mine. Well, you were a lawyer. Then it occurred to me... now you're a judge, I don't have to prove anything. All I have to do is make an accusation... and you're finished. Take some free legal advice... be very careful how you handle this. Do you have any idea what you'll have to go through? Do you really want to do that to yourself? No. But I will, unless you resign. I'm not vindictive. You can go back to lying for a living, for all I care. The thought of you being a judge... on a rape case, or something, Sophie, you're upset, and that's... entirely understandable, but I know the system and what it can do to people. Believe me, the only real way to get over this painful misunderstanding... is to let it go. Otherwise, it will take over your whole life. I just can't see the point of that. Can't you? I know it's difficult being out of work. If there's anything more that I can give you-- I didn't come here to bargain with you. You raped me. If I haven't read by the end of the week that you've resigned, I'm going to the police, and the papers. I'll see myself out. Nathan: So I got... 12 months for a first offense, less six for good behavior. - Wow. - Yeah. - That must have been awful. - It was. I saw my whole life flash in front of me, and that wasn't fun. -Uh...? - What do you want? Zucchini? I don't want to know a father that doesn't want to know. I didn't expect him to be so different. What do you mean? The offices... he's just from a completely different world. Besides, I don't know if I'm the sort of son that I'd want. Here. Sophie! This is Nathan. I destroyed his car tonight. Got a minute? Who the hell is that? I bumped into him when I picked up your paycheck. -And...? - I like him. - Keep your hands off. - I'll force myself. He's come here to look for his dad, so I said, that he could stay for a little while. - Where? - On the couch. - Unless I get lucky. - You've got to be kidding! He's the sweetest guy. He wouldn't hurt a fly. No! This is our apartment. You don't tell me who can stay and who can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So, there you are. Where did you disappear to last night? Hm? I was worried. It's funny, you want something so much, your whole life, you think about it, you plan for it, then when you get it, it's like when you were a kid. Opening a big present, and finding something... really disappointing inside. That didn't happen in my family. I think what I was trying to say was... it doesn't feel right, being a judge. What are you talking about? How would you feel... if I resigned? Are you serious? Why? And do what? You can't practice as a lawyer, you've accepted a federal judgeship. Well... I don't know. I'll think of something. You'll "think of something”? I think you've finally lost your mind. You want to give up everything we've worked for, and for what? To do something you'll "think" of? Jesus! This is insane! Hey, man, where's your wallet? Are you deaf, man? I said, your wallet. PA: Stay where you are! We'll call the police! Get in! - Are you okay? - Yeah. That was very impressive back there. It takes practice. Do you often assault people in parking garages? No. What did I do to deserve your help? Nothing. Nothing at all, actually. What do you do? It varies, I guess. Okay. You're clear here. This is where you're getting out. You don't like the police, do you? Why? When did you get out? What? Prison. You ask a lot of questions, don't you? Just one more. You want to make a lot of money? - Hey. - Hey! How did it go? Did you see him? What's he like? What does he do? - What happened? - You know what? I didn't really tell him about me yet. - Why not? - I don't know. It didn't seem right, you know? I'm seeing him again on Thursday. He told me something about a job. - A job? - Yeah. I figure, you do it well, then it's a perfect time to tell him. Get on his good side sort of thing. I don't know. It was weird. I'm sitting there, staring at him, and I'm thinking, "This is my dad,” right? But I didn't feel like he was. Well-- turn my back for two minutes... Nathan, this is Conor. Conor works with me. Hey... Is it okay if I stick around until Thursday? Sophie: Yeah. Oh, for Christ's sake! Oh, darling, this is so sudden. I'm cooking Sophie dinner tonight, to cheer her up. There's only enough for two, get it? Don't move. Wow. I want to remember you like this always. Uh-huh. I've just been for an interview. What happened? -I burst into tears. - Tears? Is that good? I haven't been on too many interviews. Listen, why don't you let me buy you dinner? Sorry. Tanya's arranged for Conor to cook me dinner. Where? There's no one up in the apartment. I've been trying to get in for an hour. Really? Yeah. Maybe he's called it off. Dinner, then? So, were you and Tanya...? No. No, no, no. Are you going to be? Why do you ask? Like I said, I'm nosy. Mm-hmm. I don't know. I'm not much of a judge of women. You sound like someone who's had his heart broken. Actually, it's been my ribs. Modern women are very physical. How long have you known Tanya for? Since seventh grade. She's the best person I've ever met. You have no idea how lucky you are that she likes you. It's a good thing I called and made reservations, huh? Hey, Tan. Sophie, that is so incredibly selfish. I'm sorry. This is my fault. I shouldn't have... I'm tired. See you in the morning. Oh, you are so busted. I should get into the hallway before someone else bags it. Now you've been promoted to sofa. Sophie: Nathan, can you get that? Hello? Callum: Sophie, please. It's for you. - Sophie: Who is it? - Who is this? Just... tell her it's urgent. Hey, he says it's urgent. Hello? Sophie? It's Callum Crane. I just wanted to talk. I didn't have time to apologize properly the other night. You caught me off guard, I'm afraid. I didn't react well. Fuck you. Thought you were meeting your dad. I am, tonight. Do I look good, you think? Yeah, you'll do. Where's Sophie? Look, Tan, about last night... Why do you like her? I'm just curious. Why do men find her so attractive? I can't-- I don't--- Never mind. Just be careful tonight, Nathan. Sometimes people turn out to be a really big disappointment. There's something I want to say-- Say it later. For now, I want you to listen. I've got a problem. I'm successful, I have money, reputation, large house, a good family, but I've got a problem. The problem is blackmail. A woman with whom I had a brief "sexual association” is taking advantage of my position and I can no longer meet her demands. In spite of my attempts to reason with her, she threatening to destroy my career and my family by revealing it all to the press. Why can't you go to the police? That's no guarantee of keeping the story quiet, because destroying somebody's life isn't necessarily illegal. It's not a solution. Do you understand what I'm saying? No, I don't. If the woman disappeared, so would the problem. Why are you telling me this? Because I believe you can help me. Why me? Because I think you need the money. I think you're capable, and you have absolutely no connection with me, the woman, or the problem. I've got one day left before she carries out her threat. In the envelope is a photograph along with her name and address, $5000 in untraceable cash, with a guarantee for another $25,000 afterwards. If you don't want it, I'm sure you know somebody who does. You're going to trust me with this? I could spend this and never see you again. I don't have any alternative. If you don't help me, I'm dead. It's as simple as that. That's it. Leo: Open the envelope, Nathan. Dennis: You don't believe him, do you? Nathan: Of course I do. He's a judge. - Blood's thicker than water. - He wants someone killed. I know, I know. Why did you take the envelope, then? - You're going to do it, then? - Nope. Let's take the money and run. He trusts me, okay? He'd never see me again. He wouldn't even know I existed. - Let's do it. - Shut up, Leo. I'm in a world of shit 30 grand would get me out. If we don't do it, someone else will. You just got out of the slammer 10 minutes ago. - Cars are one thing-- - Maybe it'll be good. - This woman-- to do justice. - We don't know that. Look, he's my dad. I can't do nothing. - Open the envelope, Nathan. - Shut up. Dennis: We're not going to the police, or warn the woman, because we don't know what happened. - Do nothing, say nothing. - I say, open it. Don't worry about your conscience. 'I do it. They'd never even know. Besides, it would make up for my car. You're thinking too much! Are you trying to fuck it up? Don't fuck around. Come on. Relax. Whoa-- Nathan, hey! What are you doing? I don't want it, Leo. That's money, Nathan. It's the way out. No--! Nathan: I don't want it. I don't want it. You fucking idiot! Radio: Next up at KWX "Morning Classics,” news and rush hour traffic, all after the weather with Mitch Grigson. Mitch: A little cool outside, Brenda, today. We've got winds coming out of the southwest at five to 15 miles per hour. This afternoon, it's going to clear up, and we are going to have sunny weather, at about 65 to 70 degrees today. Clouds are going to come back in tonight... No jobs? I'm looking for resignations, not jobs. Tanya: What? Sophie: Hello? Hello? Who was it? No one. Tan? I have something to tell you. Tanya: Wow. Who was it? It's just a name. When's the deadline? Yesterday, the day before, it doesn't matter. He won't resign. He's called my bluff, the bastard-- and I don't think I can go through with it. Sophie, I don't think that you want my advice. You want me to tell you that you did the right thing. Go on, then. Sophie, you did the right thing. Probably given the guy a hell of a scare. - The worst week of his life. - Still less than he deserves. I bet he didn't believe I'd do it, anyway. At least I don't have to go through any more shit. Bitch. Bitch! You're just the bitch. What's this for? Now I know there's something wrong. When have you ever needed a reason to drink'? It's probably my turn to apologize. I've been very tense recently, and I know I've been difficult to live with. What was it? A situation at work, which I handled very badly. What situation? It doesn't matter anymore, because the problem's gone away, and so has my solution for it. I just don't understand you sometimes. I should go. Therapy. Couldn't you miss the shrink for once? It's boring, I know, but... It's very good for our marriage. I think he's having an affair. I don't. A breakdown, then. Something's just not right. Leo. You must have been looking for us everywhere. Dennis: If this Sophie is so gorgeous and smart, and funny, what I don't get is what she sees in you. I don't thing she sees anything in me. That's why I'm going back and find out. It's like you've got this weird compulsion to get your heart broken. You should try going for a woman who's interested in you. What makes you the great expert on romance? The advantage of women never wanting to go out with you, you can stay very objective. I can see things you can't. - Yeah? - Yep. Here's Sophie's number in case you can't get hold of me. I guess this is it. Take care of yourself, Nathan. - Be good. -You, too. $5,000 isn't enough. You'll get the rest tomorrow-- today. I'm doing a job. A big job. Benny, please-- Shh-hh! "I thought that I was over you... but it's true, oh, it's true. Sing along, Leo. Benny, I swear... Sing it. "...darling, what can I do?" Louder, Leo. "...You don't love me... and I'll always be..." please-- Sing it! "...crying... over you... crying... over you... Can't go on..." Benny-- "I'm crying..."” Last chance. Don't disappoint me. Okay. Okay. Hey, Leo? What's going on? Just a little sing-song with Benny. Thankfully, he's not killing me until tomorrow. Did you give him the five thou? You're not going to do it? I'm dead if I don't, Dennis. What do I care about some bitch, huh? Think about it. She's a bitch. -Come on, Leo-- - No! I need this money. Machine: "Hi, we're not in right now, so leave us a message after the noise.” Dennis: Er... this is a message for Nathan. If it's the right number, could he call Dennis at home? It's an emergency. Driver: Where are you going, kid? - Ma'am? - Yeah? Hi. Er... I'm here for #10, but they're not in right now. I was wondering if you could-- could you let me in, please? - Mrs. Gilbert? - Yeah. Yeah, that's her. Mrs. Gilbert. Ma'am? She usually gets home in about half an hour. I'd like to wait for her inside. Tough. Woman: Hi, Sophie, honey. It's Mom. Call me. God. Dennis: Er... this is a message for Nathan. If it's the right number, could he call Dennis at home? It's an emergency. - Hello? - Nathan? - Where are you? -I just got back. I'm about 10 minutes away. I'm near some bus stop. Listen, can I come over? I'm sorry. I'm tired. It's been a long day. - A "Dennis” called. - Sophie? He said it was an emergency. He wants you to call him. Sophie, wait. Listen-- if you're close by, could you please drop off the front door keys through the mailbox? Oh, Christ. Nathan, I've got to go. Sophie? Hey, Sophie...? Fuck. What?! Excuse me, ma'am, I'm still waiting out here for Mrs. Gilbert. I was wondering, are you sure you couldn't just let me In to wait, please? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Ma'am, I'm-- I'm still waiting. There's a bar on the next block. Why don't you wait there? I know that, but I want to come in now. - Nathan: Dennis? - Leo found the envelope, the money, the photo... Nathan, he's going to do it. Nathan, do you hear me? What am I supposed to do about it? Huh? Sophie doesn't want to see me again, I've got 10 bucks in my pocket, I've got no place to stay, and frankly, I don't give a shit. You would if it was your Sophie getting smoked. What do you mean, "my Sophie”? All I'm saying is, you should look at it like that. What are you talking about? "Sophie”? The woman's name is Sophie, that's all. - Sophie what? - There. You see? Dennis, come on. Lennon. Same as John... - Dennis? - and Yoko. - Are you making this up? - No, I'm not. I mean, that's the name. Shit! Come on, come on. Hello? I don't believe I've got you at home. Hi, Mom. Fuck! Why don't you leave him? You don't have to tell me... Then tell me. You're right. You shouldn't have told me. No, Mom. Mom, I've got to go. I'm taking a bath. - You okay? - Yeah. Okay, all right. We've got to get you out of here. Why? I'm not kidding, Sophie. It's not safe for you here. What are you doing?! You know him, don't you? Callum Crane. You know him? Huh? Callum Crane? You know. What? Just tell me the truth, Sophie. Just tell me the truth. What's it to you? You screwed him, didn't you? Huh? You screwed him, then you wanted money. - Who told you that? - Sophie, listen to me... Don't touch! Sophie, just tell me the truth, please. Tell me it isn't true, okay? Tell me something! Fuck off! It's true, isn't it? - Get out! - Tell me it's not true! Fucking get out! Right now! Sophie! Open the door! Sophie! Look, I'm sorry. It's not safe for you. You've got to open the door, please! Open the fucking door, Sophie! Sophie, I'm sorry. Sophie? Listen, I'm going to be outside, okay? Don't open the door for anybody else, all right? Sophie, please! Come on! Fuck! Hi, bitch. You... are a bitch. You're a bitch. Oh, shit! Bitch! Here it comes. Sophie! Natalie: ...if you don't mind. She's your sister. Of course she can stay. Why do you sound so surprised? You refer to her as "The Antichrist,” Callum. I've heard you tell her it's lucky to fly in thunderstorms. Excuse me. I'm in a good mood. Daddy! Did Faith tell you she got into drama school? So, my chick passed the audition, huh? Oh--! I'm... expecting friends. You finally bought some? That's nice. - See the news this morning? -I wasn't in it, was I - Well, then You remember that secretary we had recently? That difficult one that Miles fired? - What's she done? - Nothing. She was battered to death in her apartment last night. Natalie: My God, that's terrible. Do they know who did it? The cops? Are you kidding? They need a diagram to put spaghetti on a plate. They're appealing for witnesses, any possible leads. In other words, they haven't a clue. ...shouting and screaming. He kept hammering on the door, but she wouldn't let him in. I wouldn't have, either. Have you seen him before? I first saw him a week ago, maybe. He started sleeping out in the corridor. I didn't like to say anything. Like I said, he looked kind of rough. Do you know his name? Nathan. Nathan Corrigan. He's been sniffing around Sophie for a while now, but she never wanted anything to do with him. Doesn't surprise me, what he's done. Doesn't surprise me at all. - Leo: Open up! - Wait up! - Open it up! Come on! - Wait up! I'm coming! Dennis: Hold on! Leo: Now! Where is he, huh? Where the fuck is he, Dennis?! - Now! Tell me! - I don't know! Now! You tell him I want the rest of my money, or his dad's name. I don't care which. You understand? Good. - Thanks. -I can't keep doing this. You think I don't know that? Huh? Tell Leo where Crane is, and let him get on with it. Leo ain't getting a fucking thing for killing Sophie. Fine. All right. What do we do about this? I got her killed, man. Dennis: It wasn't deliberate. That's between Leo and Crane. Doesn't matter. Will you forget all that? There's no shit you're not in right now. You hand yourself in, and they'll nail you, if you don't, they'll find you. You can't give up your dad or Leo without giving yourself up, too. Even if you try it, they'll both finger you anyway. Give me a drag. So, what do you think? What do you think I'll get for telling the truth? 15 years for conspiracy to murder, probably. I don't even know why she was killed. What does that matter now? That's the only thing that matters now. Hello? Nathan: Let's meet. I didn't think anything was going to happen. -I need some time. - Tonight. - I don't have all the money. - I said, tonight, at the docks, 12:00. Why did you want her killed? We shouldn't be meeting. Your face is all over the news. How inconvenient for you. You don't look happy. Why aren't you happy? - You got caught. - Yeah, I was, and I didn't even do it. Why did you want her killed? I mean, is anything you told me true? Take the money, and get out of the country. - I want the truth. - It doesn't matter. It does to me! She wanted to tear my life apart. You think I did this for fun? I want to know everything. Tell me everything. You're in trouble. Take the money. "You're"? I prefer "we." It's much more comforting, all that togetherness. There's nothing between us. That was the whole point. Goodbye. Yeah, and if you weren't my father... then you'd get away home free. What? May, 1975. The Sonics made it to the playoffs for the first time ever, and you get laid by a high school senior named Madeline Tanner. One night... here I am. Here we are. That's what I wanted to say to you, but I got scared. You stupid... stupid little shit. Tanya-- I need your help. Tanya! Wait, listen to me! I didn't do it! It wasn't me, Tanya! I didn't do it. Hey... Give me one good reason why I should trust you. There aren't any. Let's celebrate. Right. Anything in particular? I'm a father. I suppose when you think about it, it's surprising it doesn't happen more often, the number of times people stumble into bed with strangers, and never see them again. Especially you. It's amazing. At the time you never recognize those tiny moments which change your life so completely... but it makes you appreciate other things... Natalie... and how little time there is for everything... and you, I suppose. Thanks for listening, Brent. I'll go bore somebody else now. Whose is this place? It's a rental property They don't move in until tomorrow afternoon. You'll be safe tonight. Why don't you go to the police? My prints are all over the apartment. Tan, I've got a record. - For stealing cars. - I told you, I don't trust them. You don't trust them, but I have to trust you? Is that it? I'm scared, Nathan. I miss Sophie. I miss her so much. She didn't deserve this. It never would have worked between you. Anyway, your timing was off. She'd just broken up with someone. She was getting over that, and lost her job. And before that... What? Before that, she was... Tanya? She was raped. I don't know his name. Someone from the office. A lawyer. She was ashamed. She didn't think that she could prove it, so she didn't want to go to the police. That won't help poor Sophie now. You're not telling me the whole truth, are you? What happened? I know that you didn't kill Sophie, but you're not telling me everything. I don't want to see you again until you do. I'm the judge now. You raped her, didn't you? Huh? - What's it to you? - Tell me! You're making up what happened. It's a little late for that now, isn't it? Why did you want her dead? She didn't report you! She told me she would. Aren't you sorry? Huh? Sure, I'm sorry. You can't do it, can you? You don't think I will? You think I won't? Huh?! You think I care anymore? Goodbye-- Dad. From now on, you do everything that I say. I've addressed this envelope to the D.A.'s office. We'll send this tape, unless you find me a place to hide, a passport, and a way out of the country. So... you've got until tomorrow. - Who actually killed her? - What does that matter? This guy, Leo. He used to be a friend of mine. Well, it's all yours. Natalie: Doesn't it bother you at all? Look, I feel as bad about it as you do. It's just not worth it anymore. I can't see where it's going. It's not "going” anywhere. It's an affair, not a bus. Oh, for God's sake, Brent. He really needs me at the moment. I don't know why, of course. You never do with him, but he does. How was therapy? Exhausting. Maybe I should introduce myself. I'm Nathan's father. Where's Leo? I want to know where Nathan is. He's safe. If you want him to stay that way, you'll tell me where I can find Leo. Last time I heard, he was looking for you. Callum: Then help him out. I'll be at the Queen's Hotel. Dennis: It won't be easy. He's apt to disappear, you know? These real heavy people are after him. Callum: I'm sure you can get him the message. Callum: It's open. I believe you've been looking for me. Yeah. I want the rest of my money. I gave it to Nathan. What? The $25,000. He told me you two had an arrangement. No! No, we did not! 'I kill him, I will, I don't think he understands about business. Maybe you should talk to him yourself. You know where he is? It seems I'm not the only one that wants you dead, Leo. Who is he? The guy that told me to wait here for you. I'd be interested to know. Oh-hh... Well, you should have chosen your friends more carefully. Jesus! You scared the shit out of me. - Come on. - Where are we going? Nathan: You took the tape. I want it back. - We'll get into that later. - No, no, now. I'm not giving you a choice. Running away is never an option. All you can do now is trust me. You've got to be kidding me. All right, say nothing. I'm going to need 48 hours. Say nothing to who? What are you talking about? Cross the bridge to the plaza. When a phone rings, answer it. (ringing ) Nathan Corrigan, this is the police. Place your hands behind your head. Officer: Get down! Get down, now! Drop the bag! On your knees! Drop the bag! Do it! On your knees! Natalie: Callum? What are these doing here? They're yours. I know they're mine. What are they doing down here? I was hoping you'd fill them with your things, and take them away... along with your children. If your mother can't fit you in tonight, please find a hotel. I'll reimburse your expenses as part of the settlement. What are you talking about? What settlement? The divorce settlement. Or will you be staying with Brent? It would be cheaper. I'd appreciate it if you'd be gone by the time I get back. Did you get a confession yet? We won't need one, sir. We've got enough forensics and circumstantial to nail him dead. Keep at him. I'll call the ID.A. We'll charge him in the morning. Phone call, Detective. Apparently, it's urgent. The caller says he can identify the real killer, sir. He says it wasn't Corrigan. I know it sounds strange. It all started with the photo that Nathan brought back... of Sophie. The moment we all saw it, he was just obsessed. He couldn't stop talking about her, saying he was... he was going to meet this girl, and... that she was too good for Nathan, and... how romantic and perfect it was going to be when he met her for the first time. He was totally unreal about the whole thing. I don't know. Personally, I think he was going really weird. He had had a lot of trouble, and these heavy-- Go back. You're losing the story. Go back to the beginning. You have to know this. They're going to go over it, and over it, and over it. Let's start again from the beginning. Why didn't you tell us all this before? When I found the stuff-- the gun, and the photo-- and I realized what he had done, I was scared. I mean, I was really scared. You didn't know him. He would have killed me. Anyway... he was a friend, since high school. It didn't seem right. But then, when I heard he was dead, it didn't seem to matter anymore. Leo Kilpatrick. One for possession, GTA, assault. I won't bother you with the psychiatric evaluations, they're taller than my son. Forensics say the killer was almost certainly Kilpatrick, not Corrigan. The blood under the victim's nails was Kilpatrick's, plus fingerprints on the gun and photo-- which Corrigan doesn't have-- plus positive ID of Kilpatrick's motorcycle outside the house on the night. Hmm... What did Tacoma PD say about the explosion? Gang killing, drug related. They weren't surprised. Very convenient for Corrigan. It's all too neat. Well, the people who could tell us what really happened are all dead. Shall we get an extension, or let him go? Guard: Corrigan. - I'm okay, Mom. - I know, I know. Hey... How are you doing, man? Come here. I'm sorry. We'll go home now? Actually, Ma, I've got to go talk to someone first. Is that it? I could have you sent away, you know. You, Dennis, all of you. I suppose you expect me to forgive you. I don't know if I forgive myself. Why tell me now? You said you wouldn't see me again unless I told the truth. What am I supposed to say? "Don't worry, it can happen to anyone. Let's get a pizza"? It doesn't happen like that. You know what? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. I'm sorry. Nathan? Maybe you should give me your phone number. You know... in case I want to call you later, and yell at you some more. There are few crimes more heinous than that of rape. You've shown little or no remorse for the distress that you've caused an innocent woman. I hope that 10 years in prison... will give you time... to change your mind. Take him away. Machine: Message one. Nathan: It's me. I - - - I don't know why I wanted to call, really. I guess it's to say goodbye... and to ask you a question. How will you ever be able to live with yourself? Machine: 1:00 a.m., Sunday. Message two... I sentence you to life. Natalie: Hi, it's me. I followed your instructions. I'm at my mother's. Maybe we can talk. Anyway, there's food in the fridge, and I mailed that letter on your desk, the one to the D.A.'s office.
