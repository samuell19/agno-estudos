She's forbidding you only now? Is it because I'm gay? Because I'm not a real woman who can bear you a child? No, Ada. It's not that. I'm just having a hard time. We have different religions.

Where are you? -[bicycle chimes] [cell phone dings] [gasps] Oh! I'm here. Good morning, Poldo. Mwah. -Thank you. -The payment? -Add it to the list. -List it again? -Good morning, Poldo. -Good morning, Arubabes. -How many pieces of bread today? -The usual three. -[Aruba] Love you. -Love you too. [giggling] -Wait a minute. -Go ahead, go ahead. -Here, it's still hot. -Thank you. -Good morning, Dodong. -Good morning. I've got something to tell you. I dreamt about you last night. Me, too. Faggot! Faggot, look at that! -Mmm. -[gasps] [Didi] Every limb is meaty and tasty. [both squeal] Delicious. [both squeal] Hey! Is he your boyfriend? Ouch! [Britney] Stop it or you'll get more than that! -That's enough. -Do you want to fight? -[Britney] Sure! Try it. Try it! -Hey, stop it right now! [indistinct bickering] Hi, beautiful Ada. -Hey. -[woman] Look at you! Where were you last night? [woman] Why do you put up with him? My grandmother died, I was at her wake. Oh, my… You? With all your kin who have died, you should be an orphan by now. Ada, it's Dodong, come on. [Poldo and Aruba giggling] [squeals] -[Poldo] So, I'll see you later? -Sure. -Creatures of the night. -[squeals] Dodong! Get in. We have lots to do and you're always going off somewhere. And to think I pay you a decent salary. It's too early to be a villainess like Ethan Discher, Vernie Varga, Zeny Zabala, Bella Flores, and Manny Castañeda. You're bitchier than all of them combined! -Villain! -Slut! [boy] Wait for me! [soft music playing] Dodong, how are you? Mwah! -Do you want me to buy all that? -Aruba. [Krystal] So you can rest early. What? How many years do I have to wait for the bread I told you to buy? Here, Uncle Adrian. Maddening! [Krystal] When are we going out? Answer me. Mmm. Come on. Aren't you ashamed of the things you say? What if his parents curse me if they think I'm flirting with their son? You know what? I love you as my friend. That's why I'm ready to award you a trophy for stupidity! [Aruba] [laughs] What is that? It's okay with Dodong. You're the only one who's overreacting and acting like a girl! You want to see Krystal end up with Dodong and not you? -Yuck! -It's fine, he can be Krystal's. I won't like him even if the sky falls on my head. -[roof clatters] -[Ada] Ouch. Aruba, did you hear that? We should have the roof fixed. I know. It would be painful if the sky fell and hit us. [Ada] Hush! Stop trying to be cute! -[giggles] -Jeez!

You can say "Please stop singing," and I'll stop! I'm easy to talk to! But don't throw stuff at me! Animals! Animals! It's unfair! Za… turn… nah. It's your fault, singing even if nature didn't gift you with singing talent! Uncle Adrian, just admit you like Dodong. I don't want to die yet. Zaturnnah. Zaturnnah. Zaturnnah. Zaturnnah. [Ada] Zaturnnah. Zaturnnah. What does this mean? That could be a scrub and that's the brand. But from above? It even destroyed our roof. What? It came from above? You mean to say this came from the heavens? -Oh, my, Ada! -What is it? I've read stuff like this in comics! It comes with powers! This is when-- -Put it in your mouth, Ada. -Go, do it! It's got powers, trust me! -Go. -But how? And why? First, we don't know where it came from. Second… [gasps] …it's too big! How will I put it in my mouth? Hypocrite! Oh, I forgot. You have such a small mouth. -Well… -Oh, yeah, not a mouth. A pie hole. Go ahead, just try. Go ahead. Slowly. Go, "Aaa…" [Aruba and Didi] Aaa… [laughs] You're such an ugly girl! Go ahead and swallow it. You're crazy. Why should I swallow it? Wait a minute. You sang, you got hit, you should swallow it. Swallow it, go ahead. Swallow it. Don't force it. You know how much pain he's suffered. Aruba, you forget you have school. Get dressed. Poldo's waiting for you. [Aruba] Okay. [suspenseful music playing] [gags] [Ada whimpers] [Didi exclaiming] You're a winner! Miss Talent! No problems? None. [giggles] Sister, it's like water. -[Didi] Huh? -Water that got into my throat. And it tastes like… Peppermint? [Ada whimpers] Strawberry. [both laugh] Now shout, so we'll know what your powers are! Fool! You're making fun of me. What do you do when you swallow something? Don't you shout? It's hard to shout when there's a new object in your mouth. Where's the rock? -What the… -Oh! Just pour your craziness on Dodong, okay? What will I shout? Zaturnnah. What do you think it should be? Wonder Woman? You're not an American. [Ada scoffs] [man] What happened to your trip? [Ada] Zaturnnah! [explosion] -[Britney] What's happening? -[woman 2] Come here, come here! Ada, Ada, what's happening? [screams] [coughs] We tried the Christmas lights. But they short-circuited. That's it? That's it. Bye! [grunts] [Aruba coughs] What's happening? [gasps] Aruba! Didi! It's effective! I'm a woman! [squeals] Wait, wait, wait. Who are you? What did you do to my Uncle Adrian? And how did you get in here? Ouch. I am your Uncle Adrian. Wait.

Aside from being obscene, what else can you do? Hmm? Why are we here? Hey, Didi are you listening? What are we doing here? You're just my assistant. You now what? Even in comic books, the assistant follows the boss. Since your hair became red, you've become more talkative than ever. You're worse than a fag. It's your karma. You made me swallow the rock. Not all gays are talkative. There are also those with poise and breeding. There are those like me who are educated, and the gutter trash, like you! Come here. You see this tree? -Yeah? -Pull it. [birds chirping] [sighs] Are you okay, Didi? That's too big for me to pull. [Didi] Mm-hmm. Don't tell me I have to swallow that, too? Don't abuse me, Didi. So many complaints, just pull the damn thing! Okay, I will! [both shriek] You really pulled the tree out! You're now a certified superhero! You're in the league of Wonder Woman, Darna, Krystala, and Electra! [Didi laughs] [both screaming] [both sigh] Good thing you missed. I have superpowers. Basin, ladle, the utensils are all yours. You're correct! Hands on your chest, let's play. Let's see what other powers you have! [Didi laughs] -You see this lake? -Yes. From here up to the other side, jump. [Didi giggles] -Can I do that? -Yeah. In high school, I wasn't an athlete. What more now? What's wrong with you? How will we know what you can and can't do if we don't test your powers? You've got a point. [Didi] Hmm? I'll just try, okay? [Ada grunts] [majestic music plays] [Didi exclaims] That's great! Huh? Huh? [Didi gasps] [Didi exclaims] [Didi laughs] -[squeals] -That's so fabulous! You're better than all the fags! From now on, you are the Star for all Seasons. The Diamond Star, Megastar, Superstar, Bold Star! [laughs] I'm not a bold star. I am Zaturnnah. Zsazsa Zaturnnah. -What the… -Ouch. Wait. There's still one thing you haven't done yet. -Hmm. -What's that? Hmm? Fly. If you can jump, I believe you can fly. Let's go. Come, come, come! [both squealing and laughing] [Didi] Go, go now! Go, go fly! [Didi exclaims] [Didi] Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly like a butterfly! [shrieks] [screams] [Ada groans] Oh, my! I'm sorry, Ada! Ada! Ada! Oh, dear! Ada! Ada! Oh! Ouch! Oh! Ada! Ada! -Ada! -It hurts. -I'm sorry, Ada. At least, we tried. -Oh, it hurts. [cries] So, your powers are limited. At least we know now, you can't fly. -Hmm? -[whimpers] -I'm sorry. Does it hurt? -My hips are aching. I'm so sorry, my friend. Let's go. [Ada groans, cries] You're shameless! You made me do silly things all day. I'm filthy and my hips ache. At least, we saw all your superpower abilities. Right? Tomorrow, you should have a costume. Hmm. You have a small waistline. Who can I get a costume from? I don't want a costume. What do you mean? Don't tell me you'll wear a night gown when you fight? But you know what I'm excited about? Who you'll fight first. You mean to say this gig comes with a costume and fight sequences? You really have no idea about superhero movies, do you? Of course, if there's a superhero, there's a villain. -[robber] Give it now! -[man] I don't have money! There! Go! Who is that? Poor guy. -It's Dodong! -You're right! Hey! Let go of him! Go to her. -[gasps] -[Didi] Dodong! -They're coming! Oh! -[robber 1] Meddler! [robber 1] We'll see how tough you are. [Didi cries] [laughs] -You want to be the first? -She's fine. You're rude! [robbers gasp] [Ada and Didi exclaim] Wait a minute, she's mine. [grunting] You're a good ballroom dancer. -[robber 1 grunts] -[robber 2 gasps] Dodong, what happened to you? -Dodong? Wake up! -[robber 3] You've got some nerve, woman! [robber 3] Let's see what you can do! [grunting] Huh? [groans] [Didi] Serves you right! [robber 2] You bitch! Dodong, wake up! Watch Zsazsa, she's fabulous! [grunting] -[bones crack] -[groans] [whimpers, cries] Yes! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! [robbers grunting] [Didi] Go! Yeah! What now, huh? What happened? Is that bullet time? Wait a minute, Dong, okay? Hmm? Hmm. Hmm? Hmm? [robbers grunt] [Didi gasps] Hey! What are you doing there? Hey! We're not done yet! [Didi and Ada scream] [Didi and Ada crying] [shrieks] [screams] [gasp] -[robbers shrieking] -[bullets clanging] Boom shakalak. [gasp] Amazing, voovam! [Ada chuckles] -It's Dodong. Dodong! -Dodong! Dodong! -Dodong, wake up. Wake up. -Dodong, wake up. What happened? -You were robbed. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Where are they? They're gone. Didi. Who is she? She's so beautiful, with her flaming red hair. She's Zaturnnah. [Didi] Zsazsa. Zsazsa Zaturnnah. She's my cousin. She saved you. Thank you, Zsazsa, for saving my life. It was nothing. -[Didi] Oh! -[shrieks] You fag! I think you killed him! -Dodong, wake up! -I think he fell into a coma again. Dodong! Dodong! -[Didi] Here, have some coffee. -It hurts. Rest a bit. You'll get used to it. We have to work. But how? I know. Why don't we have a show? Don't worry, I won't ask you to sing. No telling what will hit you on the head. What you'll do is lift a barbell while you're showering in fire. Or you could eat glass shards while sliding on blades. Or we could put metal in your hand and you'll play a church bell like a hunchback. -Mmm. -Hmm? If you want a raise, just say so. Don't think of ways to kill me. -Crazy fag! -Hey, Aruba, here's your coffee! Yes? Thank you. -Good morning, Arubabes. -Good morning, Polvoron. No time for coffee, we're off to school. Your allowance. Thank you. Your lips. -Bye. -Okay, we'll go. -[Aruba] Good morning, Dodong. -Good morning. The parlor's still closed. Oh, I just wanted to thank Zsazsa. -Thank you. -She's dead. What? She doesn't live here anymore. [groans silently] Okay, I just want to bring some bread. I can buy bread. [groans silently] Pardon Ada. She had tamarind soup. That's why she's bitter and sour. Sorry, Dodong, let Ada be. She's having her period. [Didi humming] Hi. Here you go. Where'd you steal that from? I took it from Gwyneth. She used it last year at the Miss Gay All Saints Day pageant. I adjusted it to contain your melons. [gasps] -Hmm? -What the… You… Zaturnnah appears and you notice her boobs? What'll I do with your boobs? If I color them red, we can donate them to a basketball team. Go wear it, so I'll see if it fits you or what. -Hey! -What? This is too daring, I can't wear it. That's how superhero outfits are. No superhero wears a gown. -Wear it! -Do you see this? Why will I bother wearing a panty? We'll just see if it's beautiful. There's more in there. Hurry! You… -Isn't it a bit daring? -No, it's nice. Trust me. -Didi, you're too much! -Will I give you something that isn't? What's taking so long? Such small pieces of cloth! [Ada] Didi, it's too small. I can't wear it! You're too picky! Why are you taking forever? Miss Portugal! [Ada] It's so vulgar! Hurry, let's see it! Come out! [Didi] See, it's perfect! It's beautiful, girl! I'm embarrassed. -See? I told you! -[Ada] I told you, I can't wear it. [Ada] It's too sexy. You're fetching in fuchsia! Ouch! You're beautiful, turn around! [laughs] I told you! -I'll hit you. -You're the best in swimsuit! -I'm ashamed… -[laughs] Ashamed? Of what? You're a winner, girl! [laughs] -Winner! -Really? Faster. Oops. I can see your pecker. -It's a scene stealer! -I'll hit you. -[laughs] Hurry! -Stop teasing! Is it okay? It'll be nicer when you swallow the rock. Hurry! -So we can see the full effect. -Let's try it? -Go, sister! Hurry! -Okay. I'm telling you it'll be great. You sure I look okay? When have I been wrong? -I'll slap you, promise! -Go ahead, stop talking. [Ada breathes deeply] [gags] [swallows] Zaturnnah! [explosion] [majestic music plays] [coughs] [exclaims] Oh, my gosh! -Beautiful! -I look like I'm going to Japan! You're perfect in a push-up. -[laughs] -Mwah! Mwah! Ada's beautiful! Ada's so beautiful! I don't understand it. When I'm Zaturnnah, I lose my ability to cut hair. Oh, Ada dear. It only means Zaturnnah can do things that you can't. And you, you can do things that Zaturnnah can't. But Zaturnnah's a girl. We're different. You're being dramatic again. Stop all the melodrama, Ada. Remember this. Zsazsa Zaturnnah and Ada are one. One pink rock is all that separates you two. [Britney] Ada! Ada! -[shrieks] -[gasps] -Miss Britney! -We don't buy dead hair to make wires. I came here for a hot oil, not for insults. Miss Britney, you're just in time. I don't have casserole scrubs. -Shhh! Come in. -Stop that. You're too much. Okay, time for me to exit for now. -[Ada] Sit down. -[Didi hums] Make me beautiful. I have a date later. Wow! You're beautiful. Who is it? [whispers] How much is he? Is it my fault I'm still yummy at my age? Be thankful that you haven't been caught by your boyfriend. How come you didn't have a boyfriend up to now? Oh, dear. I'm not too keen on one now. I'm taking a vacation from love. Why don't you try marrying a woman? Who knows? You might not be gay. Maybe you just think you are. [Ada chuckles] That's a long time for me to think. But, okay. I'll marry a woman… if a giant frog attacks the town. [people screaming] [giant frog croaks] [man] Hurry! Run! [Didi] Hey, what's that? What's all the commotion? What's happening? There's a giant frog! Many houses have been destroyed, many are dead! Ada! Hey! [screams] There's a giant frog near the river! [both] Really? Where did the frog come from? I don't know, leave Britney and call Zsazsa! Let's go and call Zsazsa. Wait. How will Zsazsa change in here? Just go find a big fly. Ada, wait! There are lots of boys. -So what? -Ada. Krystal's flirting with your Dodong! I don't care. Come on, Ada, let's go. Stop this act. [chuckles] [people clamoring] [giant frog croaking] -It's the end of the world! -Let's get married! -[Poldo] Faster. Faster, Didi. -[people clamoring] [screaming] -Wait, Didi! -Gosh! There it is! Frog! Didi, Didi, who's that girl? Why is she dressed that way? It's chaos now! Hey! Zsazsa! Let's go, the frog's here! Dodong, leave us for now. Later. -Didi, where did it come from? -There. The magic volcano. Magical volcano? We have one here? Never mind the questions, just kill it! How? I can't kill tiny cockroaches, what more that giant? [croaking] Did I tell you to step on it? -My point is-- -Stop talking! Just kill it! [Zsazsa] Kill it? What? Didi… -There's the frog, there's the frog! -It's huge! [pounding] -[whimpers] -Use your power! [screams] [pounds, croaks] [screams] It's coming! [croaks] [coughs] [whimpers] -[croaks] -[screams] Hey! Get out! Zsazsa! Oh, gosh! You can do it! It's coming! [all clamoring] [grunts] Zsazsa. [grunts] [all gasp] [loud thud] [croaking] Zsazsa! The tongue! Tongue? [giggles] No! The frog's tongue! [Dodong] Zsazsa! [screams] [gasp] Beaten after one fight? What kind of a superhero is that? What if I feed you to the frog? Go away, you termite! Zsazsa was eaten by the frog! My poor cousin. [sobs] -My poor cousin! -Zsazsa! [Zsazsa grunting] [grunts] So this is the inside of a frog. What's this? [gasps] Gold coins? So this is the frog that eats gold coins? And there are guards. Amazing. Hey, wake up! [gasps] [Zsazsa grunts] [Zsazsa grunts] [croaking] [Zsazsa grunts] [groans] [all gasping] [majestic music plays] ♪ Her name is Zsazsa ♪ Clap, you simple people! ♪ Zsazsa Zaturnnah! ♪ ♪ Victory! Winner! Triumph! ♪ [suspenseful music plays] [laughs, claps] Very commendable. Who would have thought that a mighty warrior like her would choose to live in that kind of place? It seems that even the local male forms applaud her triumph. [inaudible] The mic and audio feeds reveal, they call her… Zaturnnah. Zaturnnah? It's so ironic. She's oblivious to the deception of the enemy. Can we get her so you can meet her, my queen? Not just yet. For now, she's still enjoying the applause of the men. So we're not yet sure of her character, whether she is a friend or an enemy. We would give her another test to gauge her worth. My queen. Hmm? The ball of fire? No. That would be too easy for her. Hmm. Something more lingering. How about the Fear Factor? Yes! And if she fails, we would be the ones to fulfill our directive for her. [scoffs] The extinction of the male species in their world. [inaudible] [all laugh] [menacing laugh] -[gasps] -[Dodong] Ada. What are you doing here? I was looking for you but I couldn't find you. [slow music plays] I'm not a rubbernecker. Excuse me. Too bad, you should have seen how great Zsazsa was. The whole town was worried because the frog was huge. All of us were in danger. Everybody was so amazed with Zsazsa when she suddenly showed up. You should have asked for her autograph. Uh… I won't bother you anymore. You probably have a lot to do. I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. [indistinct chatter] [giggles] I thought you didn't want to come? Aruba wanted to go, I just went with her. What? And use me? You just want to apologize to Dodong. Poldo texted me, he said Dodong is very sad. -It's your fault, you embarrassed him. -You didn't! That's why I'm here, to apologize. [Poldo] Hi, Arubabes! -[Poldo] Hi. -[Aruba] Hi, Poldo! -Where's your brother? -Over there. -Let's go. -Bye. [festive music plays] -[Dodong] Go, drink it. -Mmm. So sweet and delicious. Go to him. Go and kneel. There, there. Your turn. No, I won't. Malicious bitch! Go kneel and ask for forgiveness. Just one kiss, please? I can't let you kiss me. I don't want to. I'll give you 50 pesos. Kiss me now! Mmm. Wait. Are you crazy? You'll let Krystal bewitch Dodong? Go and throw that girl out of our galaxy! Dodong will thank you for it. -Please. -[Ada] I'd rather just go to bed.

We'll have a hair styling seminar. -There you go. Come on. -Seriously? You ask so many questions. I don't have the answers! Get dressed. Faster! So the zombies will get turned off! You dress so slowly! Faster! Come on, faster! -Oh my! -Where's Ada? [Didi] She might be in the chapel already. [people clamoring] [Didi] Get inside! Get inside! Come on, get in! Where's Ada? She's not here. I can't see her. I'm already worried. Don't worry, she's just around. We gays have special powers mere mortals don't possess.

[ominous music plays] [Zsazsa grunts] [woman] It's Zsazsa! [crowd clapping, cheering] [heroic music plays] Excuse me, Father, but we're running out of time. Fellow villagers! Let's put an end to this craziness! Think about your children's future! We can do anything if we just unite! Let's not allow the demons to succeed! Right! Zaturnnah is right! Long live us all! [crowd cheers] [Dodong] We need her! All of you, join me outside and we'll show them what we're made of! What's she talking about? What can we do? I don't want to. Not me. [indistinct chatter] Wrong! You thick-faced girl! You'll only get us into trouble. You'll feed us to the zombies. You're a fake! Yeah, right! Why? -Look at Didi! -What? Fellowmen, Didi is a fag! [man] Didi? A fag? Cool, huh? It's not obvious! [all laughing] Hey! Gay! Did you really have to announce that? But she'll whole-heartedly face the monsters without hatred in her heart for all of you! What? Her courage and self-sacrifice should serve as an example to all of us! [Aruba] Mm-hmm. Who's coming with Didi? [all muttering] [man] Me. I'll go with Didi. I'll go with the fag! [Britney] Me! I'll also join the gay! I'll join the fag! [crowd muttering] Yes! Me! [indistinct chatter] Come and join us. [breathes heavily] [crowd cheers] Father, we need holy water. To fight the monsters! Follow me, we have lots inside. [crowd] Let's go! [explodes] [townspeople chattering] -Attack! -[crowd] Attack! Attack! [grunts] [explodes] [grunts] [grunts] [zombie snarls] [zombie explodes] [Didi] Get out of there! The zombies took your clothes off again? They really like you, huh? [yells] [explodes] [Didi] There are too many of them! Where did they come from? [Didi] There's a lot of them! [shrieks] What are we going to do? Zsazsa, what are we going to do? There are too many of them. We'll run out of holy water! Let's go to Plan B! Positions! [Didi] Positions! Hurry! Hurry! Faster! [explodes] [explodes] [all cheer] Thank you, Zsazsa. Yes! Thank you. Zsazsa, you're great. Thank you. Go home. Rest. Bye. Excuse my cousin, she has an exam tomorrow. -An exam? -She's in college. Zsazsa wait for me! Zsazsa! [all gasp] [creatures cheering] Stop! Creatures from other planet, you have no right to react! Go! I am impressed. I am amazed by what this Zaturnnah can do. She is dealing with the challenges admirably considering that she dwells with simple-minded people. And it seems like she can tame the males and make them do her bidding. Hmm. I wonder. Sharon C. Yes? My queen. Prepare for our descent tomorrow morning to meet our sister-in-arms. Tomorrow it will be. Hmm. -Hey, you're too much! -[Ada] Hmm? Whenever you're Ada, you ignore Dodong. When you're Zaturnnah, you still ignore him. -Hey. -Jeez. I ignore him as Ada because we're not suited for each other. I ignore him as Zaturnnah, because the one he loves isn't real. Zaturnnah comes out when I swallow the rock. If the rock's not mine anymore, Zaturnnah is gone, too. Uncle Adrian, it's simple. Why don't you swallow the rock? End of story. So you'll be Zaturnnah forever. Aruba. Deception is responsible for so many of our world's ills. That's why I don't want to lie to people. I am Ada who becomes Zaturnnah. And not Zaturnnah who becomes Ada. Oh my! Sister Ada preaches again. What were you again? A Carmelite nun? Or a Pink Sister? Shh. Go to sleep. You know what, you just didn't get it. I got it! -Go to sleep. -[Aruba] Good night! [news program jingle plays] After the new superhero appeared in this town, a giant frog attacked. They were also attacked by the zombies. What or who will strike next? Let's wait and see. [Didi] Poldo's here! -[Didi] What a handsome boy. -What's that? [Poldo chuckles] -Don't mind me. -Bitch? -Uncle Adrian… -No. Poldo and I will just go to the hill, please? Let them. That's how it is when one is in love. [sighs] -Here. -Wow. For you to buy poison. -Come on. -Let's go. You know what? Dodong was looking for you last night. I said you were with Father Bernard. I think he got jealous. [giggles] You know what? Do you want to try the Botox in your mouth? So your mouth muscles will relax. That's enough chat, just make me beautiful. [both chuckle] [sighs] [sighs in exasperation] Wow. Beautiful. You're beautiful. You're sexy. You feel sexy, huh? The dress is from Bangkok but I bought it in Greenhills. The payment? Later, when I get back. Tomorrow? Okay. -Enjoy. -Bye. [Ada] Bye! Hi, miss. Uh, have you seen Britney? My wife? Nope. Ask him. -[Ada] Bye. -[Britney] See you. -Poldo, I don't want to. -Why not? -You're so fussy. -Don't push me. -Just one. -Poldo, stop it. Morbid. Another form of male oppression. -I don't want to. Stop. -Come on, just one. -[Aruba] Huh? -What's wrong? Who are you? What is it? [Poldo gasps] -What's this? -Poldo, what happened to you? -I don't know. -Huh? -I don't know. Aruba. -Poldo, we're both girls. You're a girl! We're like lesbians. Hey, faster! -Ta-da! -[yelps] How do you like it? Huh? If the hero has a costume, so does the sidekick for the next adventure. [Ada] Sister. Have you heard of the terms… "suits her…" "shame…" "ape"? Ada, you're envious again. Why? Are you the only creature of God? Hmm? You can't accept that I'm also talented. Look. See? [screams] Didi, you hurt your pecker again. -Ouch, ouch, ouch! -Why are you always hurting it? -[woman moans] -[man grunts] -Monster! Monster! -No. Hey, stop! No, it's me. My hair just got messed up. -[man] Hey! Hey! -Come back here, let's continue this! -[Britney] Come back! -Hey! Hey! -Oh, no! Oh, gosh! -You! You! -[man] I should've known! -[Britney] That's was not me! I'll kill you! -[Britney screams] -[gasps] [in high-pitched voice] What's this? What are these? Britney! [screams] Britney! -Uncle Adrian! -What happened? -Something happened to Poldo. -[Ada] What? What a beautiful girl! Is there a Miss Gay pageant? Why wasn't I informed? I'm so ready! Thank God and the truth is out. It's your fault. You picked the wrong gender. Now what? Zsazsa, let's go! Faster! [indistinct chatter] -Why? What's happening here? -[Zsazsa] Don't worry! I'll take care of you. Trust me! -What are we going to do? -Don't worry. Don't worry. -Zsazsa. -[Didi] Father, what happened? Their costumes are fabulous! Is there a fair? They don't look like second-hand clothes. Maybe she's the new Miss Gay and they're the runners-up Ah. Greetings! Oh! Mighty female warrior. I am Queen Femina Suarestellar Baroux. -Who? -And we Amazonistas are from Planet XXX. We have traversed the very fabric of the great cosmos to spread the gift of freedom -from the male form Avanus. -What is she saying? And I chose your planet to be the newest Planet XXX. Oh, no! To give strength to all females. With your impressive abilities, you have earned the rightful place among the mighty Amazonistas. Hmm? Come. Join us! They're foreigners! I'll take care of them. [scoffs] Go. You go home and plant sweet potatoes… [Zsazsa speaking gibberish] [crowd gasping] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [cheering] Is that cool? Amazing! Hard-core! [indistinct chatter] Stop this nonsense and go back to the fair you escaped from! You will not aid and abet us? Did you hear that? She said you have AIDS. And she said I'm a mistress! Then if you're not with us, you are against us! Watch and be amazed by what we can do! [Didi and Zsazsa exclaiming] [whirring] [priest] Don't be afraid. [laughs] Sister, did you see that? It's more powerful than your rock! -What now? -You can't do that! Would you rather I kill them instead? [Zsazsa grunts] [crowd exclaiming] Clap, all of you!

Didi, Didi! -Didi! -[snoring] She's asleep? My award-worthy acting was for nothing. -Oh. -Zaturnnah! Zaturnnah! Go fight the enemies. I'll take care of her. But not here. Many might get hurt. Go to the abandoned warehouse. For sure, the enemies will follow you there. Right. -Thank you and… -And? Please take care. They might turn you into a girl. I'll go now. Zsazsa, Zsazsa. Zsazsa, take care! [indistinct chatter] Silence! Amazonistas! Our enemy has escaped! Let's go, girls! Where are they? It's been 48 years! This is a hard job, huh? I'm talking to myself. [crashing] [grunts] [metal clanging] -[Queen Femina] Zaturnnah! -[Zsazsa scoffs] Why don't you join in our plan to slay all the men on this planet? What's your problem with men? Huh? Listen and learn, woman. Our actions are defined by our history, not by some childish need for preoccupation. Your affections towards the males of your species will be your downfall. [Zsazsa] Hmm. If only you had been there when the women of our home planet stood at the brink of total annihilation many moons ago. There are many moons on your planet? No one can ever forget that fateful day when our world's male forms voted to subjugate the women race. Many, many years ago, we waged a war against our male forms. It was the most violet conflagration ever felt on Planet X. We're not cruel, we're just getting even for the cruelty and sufferings which the men inflicted upon us. ♪ Fueled by greed and envy They resorted to brutal violence ♪ ♪ And that violence led To the near extinction ♪ ♪ Of the female race ♪ ♪ Only a few women were left alive ♪ ♪ They were turned into baby-makers ♪ ♪ Still alive, but maybe better off dead ♪ ♪ These women suffered in silence ♪ ♪ Bereft of the right to speak ♪ ♪ They suffered for 100 years ♪ ♪ My mother's and my mother's mother Were among those kept alive ♪ ♪ They lived like animals ♪ ♪ And died like animals ♪ ♪ One day I decided I won't have it anymore ♪ ♪ I couldn't take it anymore I made a ruckus ♪ ♪ We rebelled and defeated them ♪ ♪ And when we were strong enough ♪ ♪ We women escaped ♪ With cunning, stealth, grace, and beauty, we battled with the male forms and triumphed, without never to be conquered again. Until now that remains true. And I became their leader, Queen Femina Suarestellar Baroux. And one of my very first decrees is the subjugation of all male forms of the universe! Idiot!

As I've said… it was the male forms that taught us the art of violence. If we have to act like men to triumph over all, then that's what we'll do. You hypocrite. So you just wanted to act and behave like men after all? Then be envious of what I'm about to show you. [retches] [explodes] [all gasp] [all exclaiming] -[Nora A] Oh, my gosh! -Ada and Zaturnnah are one? -Ew! -Male form? Not a woman? Shocking! Confounding! Bewildered, befuddled. Help us, my queen. It… it must be some form of cloaking device. [Queen Femina] Listen! Do not be deceived! It's just a gimmick! [laughs] [laughs mockingly] We await your advisory, my queen. What are you trying to say? Do you want us to guess? How many words? Three syllables? [gagging] Die, Zaturnnah! [explodes] [screaming] Disgusting! It's a vile male form from Planet XXX. Our neo-genetic programming dictates… That in the presence of a vile male form from Planet XXX… Our abilities will be better tenfold! Engage! Fellas! I'm your queen! [Vilma S] You're just another vile male form! [Nora A] Yes, Vilma S! [Vilma S] Lift us up now! [whooshing] [all exclaiming] [all laughing] Ada! Ada! Ada! You know? Yes. But don't worry, I won't tell anyone. What's important now is for me to get you home so you can rest. Dodong, the rock is gone. The Amazonistas might come back. I don't care about the rock. What's important is that you're safe. Let's go. [grunts] A giant frog! A huge frog… So many monsters, it was scary! The Amazonistas were fought by Uncle Adri-- Zaturnnah fought the Amazonistas. Zaturnnah is amazing! She's a great leaper. Zsazsa defeated them. She defeated them all! She's so strong. All of us fought, it was really scary. They even turned us into girls.
