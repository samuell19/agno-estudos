You're welcome. Thanks. I don't want her. I don't want here, tell my mother I don't want her. Tell mother I don't want her. Master, Kathy is a nice girl. I don't want her. She's nice, pretty and tall. I don't want a tall girl. I hate a taller wife most. I hate a taller wife most! Chop off her legs then. I was just joking, do figure things out. We can pose problems so that she backs out herself. First, we must make her a princess. Master, I think we should play her a trick quickly and exactly. Let her think she's a winner. then insult her in public. She must be get away with anger at that time. It's scenic here! Look how happy they are. Here, everyone has his way to make himself happy. I hope very much I'm one of them. You can. But we rich guys... are different from ordinary people. We can't mix with them at all. This time I bring you on board as I want to do a romantic thing with you. What romantic thing? Look. Ladies and Gentlemen, please enjoy yourselves, as our Master will settle the bill tonight. Tonight is the engagement of our Master Albert Lai & Miss Kathy Luk. Marry me, you can't run away from me. This diamond necklace worthing at $20 million is my engagement gift for you. Come in. Hi, Mandy. Miss Kathy, are you happy tonight? Yes, did I perform alright? Not bad, but there's a more severe test tomorrow. Really? You needn't worry, come here. I must prepare information for you about wine. If you've quieries, there's a diskette for reference. Don't read too late, or you won't look fresh tomorrow. OK, thanks. Good night. What to sip this Le Pin of 82? No. Thanks. You've some if you like it. Kathy, want to try some? I... Come on, try some. Try this Petrus, it's also of 82. Thanks. All wine of 82 is good wine. That year is real harvest for wine. To see if it's excellent wine, we must also check whether is sticks high on the glass. Good wine sticks high on the brim. Look, the running down Red Tears. Red Tears, what a sad name! So you're a wine connoisseur. Your girlfriend is not only pretty, she has a good taste too. The tannin and oak flavour gets together. Eric, if she likes it, you'd better buy several cartons. If she's fed up with it, you can drink it while eating crabs. Drink it while eating crabs, good idea. You're kidding. In fact... I don't know much. In fact, I learnt if only last night. As I don't want you to lose face in front of others. In fact, you needn't learn so much, what for? You're my woman, no one dares to look down on you. they know who the dog's master is. I didn't mean you're a dog, you're human being. They know who the dog's master is, right? Right... Come on, drink this. Master, you can't go on like this. Master! I've no appetite. Why? I'm in a bad mood, I think it's bad to treat Kathy this way. She's very pretty indeed, I should love her, right? No one can say you should or should not about feeling. In fact, we can't either talk about pretty or not in love. The key is that you ask yourself whether do you really love her. Otherwise, don't try hard to, you won't have happiness if you do. You think a handsome man like me will have no more girls? Maggie, come and help me, hurry up. Must we do all this? Sure, we're flying to the Caribbean Sea to meet your sister-in-law to be. Of course we must be dressed grandly. Right, I haven't found the proper shose yet. Help me choose a pair. You can't find a pair among all these? I've chose some, help me choose the best one. Mom, the way you choose shoes is like brother choosing a wife. They're all good, but none suits you perfectly. This pair then. He has engaged 7 times, but none of them becomes his wife. So I mean to choose a girl for him this time. Just like this pair of shoes, she will suit him. Madam, Miss. Eric, where's Master? Master... he is on board. Kathy, tell me if you have anything not happy, don't be afraid. This is surely delicious. You're so thin, you must eat more. Tell me if the food isn't up to your taste. I'll change some for you. Your uncle really gets on my nerves. Is there anything more important than meeting his soon to be daugher-in-law? But he told me he is buying up a company and something... ...that he has meeting to attend to, I can't help it. Don't blame on him. I don't.... Right, did you enjoy the voyage? Well, there isn't much to enjoy on board. You can either swim or jog. But there is a great beautician here. Mom, stop talking, let others eat please. Eat something please. You want to drink water? No, don't drink that, local water is dirty. We've brought mineral water with us, drink mineral water. Fruit? No, fruit is cool, bad for girls. I've specially made this chicken soup for you. I'm really convinced that you're blood mother and daughter... ...as you both...speak alike. Eric! Sorry. Do you think there is a good chance this time? I have no idea. Your brother is almost 30, I really hope he gets married this time. Right, Maggie, don't go away, keep an eye on them for me. OK... Inform me at once, whether it's good news or bad news, got it ? OK, mom, I will. Come in! Are you feeling sick? Why it took you so long? No, I'm fine. OK, tomorrow Master is having a lunching with estate people. Here's some data, take your time to read it. Thanks. Good night. Rose, don't be nervious, close your eyes, open your arms. How do you feel? Why does it smells like cigarette? No way. No wonder! They fly at the bow, while we are at the stern. The exhausted smoke stinks, Jack! Is it that you've put on weight so now you can't fly? Why don't you say you're not handsome enough? You're wrong, all others say I'm the most handsome guy on board. Let's fly at the bow. We'd better fly in the middle of the ship first. How to fly in the middle? Look at your hair, it's all flying up. That couple must be fans of movie Titanic. Flying the wind all alone? Where are you from? Are you here for a vacation? No, I didn't come here for a vacation, I'm a waiter of the restaurant. I come from Beijing. Beijing. Your accent tells me that you're from Beijing, I'm from Beijing too. Are you? Yes. You also come from Beijing? Right, you're the first folk I've met since I left Beijing. What a coincidence! Nice to meet you, I'm Timothy Hwang. I'm Kathy Luk, both our names end with "thy". "Thy" means culture. Right. Right. Shall we make friends? Sure. Timothy Hwang. Kathy Luk. Let's chat aside. Sir, bravo! Bravo! Captain, good morning. Good morning. Good morning. She's my friend. She's beautiful. Look, here is the bow. If the ship runs up with iceberg, reef, swirls. ...the radar can detect all that from 10 knots away. Can it? Yes. Therefore, this ship will never act like Titanic... that is, making a sharp turn when seeing an iceberg. From the movie, there should be a lot of men in the engine room. That is a scene in the movie "Titanic". In the movie, that ship used coat as fuel, and that is usual in 1912, now is 1999. Look at this side. "Fascination" is controlled by computers. We have to serve meals to 2000 people every day. So our kitchens are very enormous. Excuse me. Open? It didn't open. Surely not, you think this is a kung fu movie? How come I can't spit afar? You forget to gather more saliva before you spit. Which bastard spits? Not this way.. Run that way! Why do you become a waiter on board this ship? In order to ...see stars. As I find there are many "me" under different stars, and in each of us, there's a different star too. What's the difference? No difference, as I need a job to make a living. But frankly speaking... ...I majored in astronomy when I studied in Chin Hwa University. Did you? But I forgot most of it soon. After running the world, I've made a discovery. wherever you go, riding a ship... or getting on any island or arriving any country, you can always find Chinese people. For example, right on this ship, I meet you. Want to jump? You jump, I jump. Good! Yes! Come on. No, Master Lai, how can you invite us to eat at such a place? How could you? Is there a VIP room? May I help you, Sir? Speak in Chinese. May I help you, Sir? Is there a VIP room? No. Is there a VIP room? Sorry Sir, really no. Is there a VIP room? Sir, sorry, there is really no VIP room here. We've prepared food. Throw all those dishes into the sea. Brother! What is it? She have met a new man, come on. What for? Master, chance has come, she takes up a man. Watch me. What are you doing over there? We've all gone but why are you still here chatting with the guy? Sir, we're only chatting odds and ends. Shut up! I haven't cursed you yet. Do you know who she is? She will soon be my wife! And why do you drag her here? Come here. Come over here! Kneel down! Come! Sir, you're over the line. You rich guys are human, we are human too. Manager! May I help you, Sir? Sure. This gentleman was being impolite to my boss. I will be very appreciated if you can do something before I lose my temper. Thank you for your co-operation. Can you speak in Chinese, Sir? Master, I've just called up HK and bought up that company. You can do whatever you like now. I fire you! Beat it at once! Wait. You needn't go away. What did you say? I said: he doesn't have to go away. Here is a ticket. From now on, he's a passenger of this liner, just like you. No one can cast him away. Miss, who are you? You mustn't get involved in our affairs. None of your business, I only want to treat my friend to dinner. Miss, you don't know who I am? Don't think you're very special. Besides being rich, besides being a big spender... besides talking evil and being a sly guy. You've nothing special at all. I'll remember what you just said. Thanks for your advise. Master, you did great. Ladies and gentleman. Everything will be on my house, be my guest tonight. This guy is too cocky. So what if he is rich? Let's go. Eric. Check the identity of that girl, I want to know it immediately. Master, just talk to me if there's anything, and don't tell him anything. Miss Sandy. Sorry, the Captain doesn't allow letting off fireworks on board. It's OK. Why do you let off fireworks on board? My parents met on a liner in the Caribbean Sea. My mother died long ago. My father died two years ago too. They hoped to have their ash sprinkled into the Caribbean Sea. So that is why you put their ash in the fireworks. So, is this why you're riding on this liner? I want to indulge myself when I still have money. I want to do that too, but I'm a poor guy. Master, I've checked the identity of the girl. Her father is from Chiuchow, China. Her mother is from Tokyo, Japan. Simply speaking, she's a mixed. Her father used to do business in Thailand, one of the top 10 riches men of the nation. Master, his daughter bullied you like that, why don't we buy in Thai Baht bulkily, so as to ruin the Thai stock market, then he will soon... What are you talking about? He taught me to say so. None of my business. Always wrapped in a piece of cloth, I wonder what's she hiding. Look at her legs, her legs... Her legs're like walking turnips. Yes. Right Look at her eyes, her eyes... Her eyes are so narrow. Right, they're. And her mouth, look at her mouth... Nothing special with her mouth. Look at her breast, her breast... You shouldn't look both sides, look at the middle of her. Her eyebrows aren't bad. What do you see? I only see some bubbles. Master, shall we go? I still want to rest for a while longer. Take your time then. What are you doing? Stir it. I must have her, no matter what happens, help me figure it out. Thanks. I think romantic is the most important thing when going after girls. Master has. Gentleness. Master has. OK... Horny. Master has. Kindness. Master has. OK... Handsome. Master has. Heroism. Master has. I think money is utmost when going after girls! What shall we do after we get off the ship? We will decide later. I'm sorry about yesterday. Nothing, it's none of your fault. I just find your fiance very cocky. Sorry, I shouldn't say bad remarks about him in front of you. It's OK, I always felt that... it's a mistake to be engaged with him. Break off the engagement with him then. Sorry, I say bad mearks about him again. Brother... What is it? I saw something today, I feel uneasy all night. What is it? Today I saw Kathy and... I know, I understand. Don't you want to know what happened? I know, I know everything already. Listen to me, you don't know at all... Listen to me, I'm very sleepy, let's talk again tomorrow. Be good, close the door, thanks. Be good. Remember to ask me for it tomorrow.

What good news and bad news? The bad news is, the girl you chose for brother has left him. The good news is that the girl brother chooses himself is excellent. What do you think about this time? I've confidence it them. Who's it? It's me? Why did you come here? Let me help you out. If you came here to laugh at me... ...please make an appointment, I'm very busy. You must not have against me. What good deeds have you done? I was responsible for a land business when I was 24, I made $0.6 billion. I set up satellite TV when I was 26. I sold it wihtin 6 months and made a profit of $1 billion. When I was 27, I was awarded The Excellent Youth. At 28, I was awarded Asian 10 Top Businesmen. All of it because of the influence of your father. Have you done anything without help from you father? Yes, my father was not here when I had lunch today. If one day you go bankrupted... ...I say you wouldn't be better than a dog. You mustn't look down on me! Tomorrow after I disembark, I will only take US$10 with me, and I can still live happily for 3 days. You can never do that, I say. I can. I say you can't. If I can, you must let me help you. OK, I'm sure you can't, anyway. You're here? Come on... What is it? I've checked she's penniless now, I want to punish her for you. I'll take her up for $1 million. But her beauty is only worth $0.9 million. What's special with you? You're just jealous, I say. Boss is doing a big deal tomorrow... No way, I must help him. I must give him a bank card. You said no one will follow you within these 3 days... ...but how come they're still here? They come to see me off, I'll ask them to go away. She won't let you come with me. I must go now. Do you have anything to tell me? I've only $10 with me. I was born with a silver spoon, I know nothing. Eric. Brother. What is it? I've a secret to tell you. OK.. Wait til I come back. Let me treat you to dinner, I've $10. Let's read the price first. Not expensive, only at $4.99. It's less than $10 for the two of us. If you spend all that $10, how do you live on the next 2 days? No, I... I can manage. Go ahead. OK, I won't spend it then. OK, I'm really fine now. You want to sleep here? Yes. Can you? It's dangerous here. You're a girl, you mustn't sleep here. What if I take you to a hotel... ... and rent two rooms? I won't go, find a hotel for yourself if you must. No, I know you're a girl... No way, I'm a man, I must accompany you... ...even if it's dirty here. No...I mean...can you tell me... How to open the sleeping bag? Hey, come on. Hey, come on. No... Hey, come on. No... Hey, come on. No... Sorry... Shit! Come here. What are you looking at? Isn't it lovely? It's okay. Although it is common, I like it very much. How much is it? $20 Sorry. Is there an ATM here? Police will arrest you. It's alright, as long as I like that. Amen. If you've any wish, pray and it will come true. Amen. What is your wish? My wish is to know how you go bankrupted. It's just a common story. After my father died, my uncle transferred all the properties. When I took over the company, it was already in heavy debts. That's all. You're pitiful. It's fine with me, my uncle's properties jump a triple fold, now worth at $15 billion. But I reckon he must have used much efforts on it. If one gains something, he must lose something else. At least he won't have time and mood to wander like I do now. By the way, what is your wish? I won't tell you. Are you OK? What is it? We must make some money for a living. I recall something. I've really done something without any help of my father. When I was at primary school, I entered for Inter-school Music Festival. I won championship in piano. Want me to play for you? Sure. It's pretty difficult. Hey, wahat are you doing there? I hired you to come here and work I know. But... But, what? You've to do your job. You are not supposed to think about girls here. You want to be a playboy right? No. But you look like a playboy. Tell him how rich you are; tell him you can buy up his restaurant. Did I say anything wrong? I've lost. I know I can't live such a life. Even if I can, nobody believes it. I'll get back aboard tomorrow. Take care of yourself. Master... Master, you're back...it's good. What are you trying to do? Master... OK... Master... Brother, it's good you're back, we're worried about you very much. Right, master... Master, where's my money? When will you pay it back to me? I haven't spend it, take it. Master, we... let's get aboard. I won't go, I want to think about something here. Whtat's wrong? Come on, get barod, think about it when you're on the liner. No, I find myself very useless. You're very useful. I can't even manager these 3 days. You've managed 2 days, just missing 1 day. That is very good already. No... You've spoiled me. All you know is to kiss up to me! Being a man, I must face the world! I must defeat myself before I can defeat others. Why you suddenly speak so fluently? And no pending at all? You're nuts? Don't you have a brain? Can't you tell a lie? Why must you speak so frankly? You wear a stinking cap because you fear others see you're brainless? Follow Master at once! Why are you standing here? Move! Amen.

Captain, help us! Help! You shouldn't be in the pool with your clothes on. I told you we should be wearing swimming suits. Jack, no one wears swimming suits in the movie Titanic. Help me... Let me help you... Help me! I'm sinking! Eric! You're looking for me? Master isn't here, and there's nothing to do, let's go eat something together. I'm on a diet. Let's go dance at the disco.

Stop me so that Master looks a real man. He's not a woman, are you nuts? Come and look, this is a woman. Help...help... That fatty bastard! I thought you were really a hero, but you still need help from the others. You have broken the rules. Rubbish! You beat my Master. Officer, arrest him! Arrest him. Let him go. Let him go, let him off! Can't you stop for a while? Why must you behave like this all day? Why must you follow me? do you want to follow me for the rest of your life? Do you want to be my dog forever? We're the leader dogs. Don't you have any self-esteem? Brother, you're back? I've something to tell you. Tell me next time. Listen to me, you can make it. Go ahead. You're at least stronge than those 2 dogs. Do you hear me? How do I know? What did you just tell Master? Coke is sold at $1.9 over there. I want to break off engagement with you. Because I've found someone already... ...he can breathe the same air with me under the same sky. Since you don't love me, why don't you let me go? Let me tell you. The one you love may not necessarily love you. Unless he tells me inperson he loves you. He will, he's just outside. Ask him in. Take this necklance as my gift for you.

When I was a kid, my mom always gave me some candy when I was not happy. OK. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Sorry. What? Didn't you hear? I heard that, but they didn't hear it. I'm sorry! Bastard! You're a bastard, but still a gold-plated bastard. Please be honest. Dirty bastard... A gold-plated one. Thank you. But my sixth sense tells me, she belongs to you. Brother, don't give up. Master... Ok... My seventh sense tells me, if you jump into the sea and swim over, she will definitely be moved. I was just saying if. Sandy! Master! Brother! Sandy is over there! Bye. Sandy! Master is over there, in the sea! Sandy... Bye. I worked hard to buy this chain for you. Do you like it? Help them up the ship. I'll give you a surprise. Thanks. Not this one, the one over there. Didn't you want to put the ash in the fireworks? How did you know? You told Jesus last time, and Jesus told it to me secretly too.
