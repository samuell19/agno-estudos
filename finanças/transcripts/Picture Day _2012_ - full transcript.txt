You were a little fat, but I could still pick you up. Yeah, chubby little Henry. So why are you still in high school? Mm, because I failed calculus, and, um, history, and remedial gym.

Are you cruising for little girls? Little? They're all, like, massive. What are you doing here? I'm just biking around, thought maybe you'd want to come with me. I don't bike. Do you walk? Yeah, I walk. I walk just fine. More than fine, I'd say. Okay, we are now looking for lithium coin cell batteries. No, hold on. Are you build-- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Are you building a bomb? Is that what hap-- Is that-- No. No. No. No? So what kind of party is this? Um, it's just a few friends. It'll be fun. Oh. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you--Hi. Yeah? Yeah.

I think I gotta go. Hey, Mom. How was your day? Claire, I told you to stop asking me that. Sorry. * 'Bout to be, 'bout to be about it now * * Let's think about it, be huhh, huhh, huhh * * I'm humble to the rich * But Edgar Allan to the po'... * Claire, in my office now. * Can't take it any more * If we ain't rapping for these folks * * What the hell we rapping for? * * Everything I would have been * * And could have been are down * * And everything I... It's the third week in the school year. Already, we're doing this? I'm, like, three minutes late today. I've got a file here, Claire. Shall I open it? Mm, no. Well, I'm going to. You had less than 50 % attendance on your course load. I passed all my exams. Pulling the fire alarm, that gave you a three-day suspension. You stole some wardrobe from the drama department. That was funny. You were found in the darkroom with Neil Levine. Do you remember that? Yeah. That was me expressing myself... Oh, really? Physically. And you failed grade 12 math. I'm never gonna use math. You don't think so? No. I know that. Like, I know I will never use math. Just like you know you're never gonna use phys ed? A physical education credit is mandatory for a diploma. Yeah, but then you have to do burpees and shit and, like, beep tests. Okay, one thing. What are burpees? The up-down. It's so embarrassing. Claire, I want your grad photo out in that hallway. Can I go to class now? You're making me late, and then I'm gonna get in trouble, and then I'm gonna have to come back here, and we're gonna have to have another little--pfft--"chat." You can't stay in high school forever, Claire. You did. A. Meighan High debaters will meet today in the gymnasium at 3:45. Happy Birthday today to Savita Thalavalasingmu and Henry Niblock. The Gay-Straight Alliance will meet today at 1:30 in room 120. Happy birthday, dude. Thanks. What are you doing here? Going to homeroom. It's your day. Let's ditch. I was an awesome baby sitter. Heh. You forgot to feed me. No, I didn't. Once. Give it. Twice. Twice. I'm not done yet. Didn't you have a date... or something? What are you talking about? Some man with a bike picked you up from school. A man? I don't know. Uh, yeah. I did have a date with James. He has super-uneven balls... like, creepy uneven. Phbbt! Like, one is, like, down to his knee, and the other one is, like, up in his pelvis. I'm pretty sure that's impossible. No, it's--I thought it would be impossible, but it's totally true. How are your balls? I'm not about to talk about my balls. They're that uneven, hey? Are they really little? Have they dropped yet? I'm not gonna talk about my balls. I'm hungry. You want to eat something? Uh, yeah, sure. Yeah? Put this-- Little balls? Come, little balls. Okay, I'm coming. * The old masquerade * Is in trouble again * Yeah, a heart's not enough * * To feel that fellowship end * * After all the roads * It's a bitter pill What? * To take * They'll fandango waltz * And cauterize your remains * Do my hair. Hmm? Do my hair, too. * Until this old world... Hey, whatever happened to that, um-- that school? Oh, the D. Patmore Academy for Exceptional Learners? Yeah. The uniform that you had and everything. No, shut up. Yeah, um, I don't know. I just told my parents I wanted to go to public school. You're no longer exceptional or something? Well, no, I still think I am. It's just that... Public schools have girls? Well, yeah. Do you bite your nails? Maybe. Really? I rip mine off. Whtt. Are the windows different or something? Yeah, uh, energy-efficient reno. Now the house is freezing. Hey, I got you something. You did? Yep, for your big, fat birthday. What'd you get me? Boo. Kleenex, wrapped in your hair elastic. Thank you very much. Heh. Um... You like it? Yes. I love it. Do you want to come inside? My mom made Nanaimo bars yesterday. Yes. Yeah? Yes, I do. Shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. Okay, just wait here. Surprise! Surprise! Happy birthday, sweetheart. Thanks, Mom. Claire, is that you? Hey. Were you surprised? Sure, Dad. They're, uh, Russian, um, for night raids. Quite old, actually, from the 1960s. Cool. Thanks, Dad. Oh, look, it's got a long-range focus on it. Huh. Hey. Claire. It's so nice to have unexpected guests drop by. Yeah. Whoop, you missed a crumb. Thank you. So, Claire, you must be in university by now. No, I wish. I'm doing grade 13. My victory lap. Whoo! Well, Henry sure has grown up, hasn't he? Yeah. Did he tell you that he was in the Science Fair finals? Mm-mm. Hydroponics. Wow. This cake is awesome. Help yourself. Well, that's not edible. 181, 191, 193. 191's not prime. Yes it is, retard. Give me that. Hold up a second. It is. That's crazy, man. It's a weird one, like 47. Dude, I always miss 47. Oh, Claire, are you leaving? Let me get you a loot bag. Oh, no, no, no. That's--That's cool. I'm, uh--My mom's just probably wondering where I am, so... Happy Birthday. * She like the fluid, groove it * * If you groove, I don't mind * * Stick 'em up high * Feeling your fire * If you walk along * Don't bump my equipment * Rest of the time, we was jumping * * Feel the viral flow * All in your face, we mighty go * * Feel the viral flow * All in your face, we mighty go * * Go, go mighty, mighty * Go, go mighty, mighty * Go, go mighty, mighty * Throw your hands up mighty, mighty * * I think about you night and day * * I think about you night and day * * I feel a little bit lonely * * I think about you night and day... * Very sweaty. Well... You all right? * I think about you * Night and day I got you. I got you. Don't be late for homeroom. Hey. Hey. So I would have invited you to my party, you know, if I knew about it. Yeah, that's cool. It was fun. Really? Nope. Hey, Twist-off. Bitch. How are you settling in? At school? It's not exactly difficult. You making any friends or... I've been here for three weeks. Decisions happen fast. Go. Henry, befriend. Hey, Henry, you ready? Okay. Back up. Okay, 1, 2, 3. Action. That was really good. That was awesome. And so he says we've got nothing to talk about, and I said, "What about Wasaga? You know, what about Wasaga, Bob?" He starts accusing me of bringing up the past. All I am doing is just trying to remind him of what we have. Right? Like, how strong it is or... was. Anyway, I don't even know what to believe anymore. Bob was the kind of guy who-- Shit. I'm out of minutes. Let me just go around back, and I'll-- What, you gotta go? Hey, babe. Hey. Is that milk still good? Doesn't taste great. Henry! What? I've got a strategy. What kind of strategy? I'm not even allowed to have girls in my room. Your mom let me right up. Stop. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. I need this space. Okay. I can--I'll fix it. Henry, just chill. I will--Okay, I'll make a space if you stop touching everything. I will make the space. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. So this is, like, a bluish black, right? Um, no. More blue than black, I'd say. Fuck. You dripped on my pants. And why are we doing this, again? Henry, you have zero impact. Honestly, you're like the fucking invisible man. Zero impact is actually scientifically impossible. Whatever. My point is it's not too late for a do-over. Okay. Take off your clothes. Isn't that a bit superficial? Henry, I don't have all day, okay? Put that on. I'm going for troubled. But I'm not troubled. Yes, yes, you are. No, I'm a little sad 'cause I can't make any friends, but I wouldn't call it-- Henry, it's perfect, okay? You're new. You're mysterious. You have no friends. You've got this fucking weird-ass selective mute thing going on. I'm not a mute. I talk a lot now to certain people. Yeah, but you won't have to, 'cause despair alone will get you laid. Good. Looks good. Five minutes. Are you ready? Yep. It's very serious. Can you change it back? No. It's picture day tomorrow. Really? It's Picture Day? Next. Let's just take a seat. Yeah, t-turn your knees just a little bit that way. Good. Smile. * Hi * It's been a while * Your friendly smile * Has lost its charming glimmer * * Why is it a crime? * You're free to try * You'll get what's coming to you * * You might let your guard down, Henry * * My, look at the prize * This could be nice * You've covered all your bases * * Climb before you hide * Then pull your pride * This will be waiting for you * * I go back to zero, Henry * I see what you think... So? Am I a genius, or what? I'm not sure. Before, no one looked at me, but now, everyone just looks at me weird. Yeah, 'cause you have blue hair. Hey, freak, nice hair. Hey, back off, Tiffany. He's got issues. Fine. But if you're planning a rampage, could you make it third period? I've got a quiz. A bit young for you, isn't he, Claire? What? 12:00, girl checking you out. Where? My 12:00. Don't stare. Just walk like a normal person. I am. Don't be a creepy mute. Go. What? Hey. Henry, right? I like your hair. So what are you doing tonight? Well, a bunch of us are going to the ravine to hang out and drink and stuff, so if you want to come... Okay. Cool, so I'll see you then. It's still a weeknight, you know. It's still a different feeling. I don't know. It's really-- It's not a science, you know? It's like a fricking-- It's a guesswork, this whole thing. Oh, you're so serious. Mm-hmm. You're, like, such a serious rock star. I was in charge. This guy's awesome. Or it might be good-- Two and four might be good, too. Yeah, that's my old place. Kitchen rehearsals. You're really young. When was this? It's five years ago, fricking six. What happened to you? Oh, it's-- The band aged me. Yeah. 10-piece band. My next band's gonna be two people. Really? Who-- Who's it gonna be? Me and you. Pfft. I don't want to be in a band. This is a pretty big family, and I don't know-- This is the good part. ...hard to bring this many creative people together, but it's-- It's pretty incredible. It's really cool. Henry, tomorrow after school, I have a meeting, so I need you to... Oh. Claire did it. That was nice of her. Uh, I have your tubs for the Planned Parenthood thing. Thank you very much. That's amazing. Night, mom. Good night. Hey. Hey. So, what's up? Um, nothing. Hey, Alison. Hey, Alison. How about a mÃ©nage Ã  four? Can we at least walk? Are you guys going down to funky town or something, or are you hanging out? All right. So do you want to go take a walk? Sure. All right, let's go. - I'm sorry. - Wait. Sorry. Sorry. Wait. Really sorry. Your sock. Last call. Maybe you'll call this time. Wow, apparently she does know you. Last call at the bar. Yeah. 905. Thanks for making the trip. Am I gonna read that in the... He doesn't shower much, so you got at least four days. Yeah. It's--It's-- Thanks. Um, you know what? Just excuse me one second. Hey. Hey. Hey, what's going on? I'm going. You got your coat. Yeah. What's all this? You've got a lot of fans. Got two arms. I have no way to get in touch with you. Come on. I know you don't. Why don't you come to rehearsal? You can hear our new song. Hmm? You were really good tonight. Last call for drinks. Hmm. Leave me a message. I'm out of minutes. Sure you don't want to stay? No, I'm good. Honey, kids sneak out all the time. It's just so selfish. No, no, no, Ruth, just-- Consequences. Hey, pal. Where you been? Oh. Bingo, all year. No, Mom, not bingo. Service is a privilege. Okay, fine. Make me phone canvass or stuff envelopes, or I--sell poinsettias. We always need volunteers at bingo. Yeah, 'cause it's depressing. Uh, he-- he has a point, Ruth. That may be so, but it is an excellent fund-raiser for Planned Parenthood. Oh, fuck you. Bingo is hell. Hi, Bob. Hey. B-9. B-9. N-45. N-45. N-39. Bingo. So the bingo cards, one for two, three for five. What are you doing, man? Pick up all this stuff off the table, you know? You don't want to miss anything. And, uh, you know, wipe the--wipe the tables down every 30 minutes or so, you know. You go to A. Meighan High? Yeah. I just graduated from there, actually. Do you know Claire Paxton? Yeah, I actually do know Claire. She, uh-- She's, uh, what? She's a what? She's right here. She is. What's up, Claire? Hey. How's it going? Lewis. Yes. Yes. That is me. That's who you are. How's life? It's good, grade 13. Yeah, I heard. Henry, we need some, uh-- We need some dabbers. We're running out, all right? Yeah. Keep it clean out here, guys. Why are you here? Is it 'cause of your hair? No. I, uh--I got in late last night. Did you-- Uh, almost. Henry, yeah. What? What? What's almost? Just the tip? What are you even doing here? Your mom told me. What happened? Hey, you have to tell me about it, though, please? Hey, what happened? Could you get it up? Okay. All right. That wasn't the problem. Just--Just the opposite problem. Uh-oh. I don't know. I thought it'd be more dignified. Oh. And there was all these knees and elbows, and... I lost a sock. Relax. B-9. B-9. It happens all the time. Yeah, but this was worse. Why? G-57. G-57. I just wanted to be prepared. I-- G-55. I made a kit, and I-- I lost it. What do you mean, a kit? I left it behind. What are you talking about? A kit. Yeah, condoms, lube, wet wipes, a breath mint in a-- in a plastic bag. B-10. Wet wipes? B-10. Oh, Henry. And you... N-39. Left this... N-39. In my sock. Which is where? I--I just took off after. I--I don't know. N-42. N-42. Do you think she found it? Oh, yeah, she definitely found it. B-4. Hmm. B-4. You're a kit guy. Guy with a kit. I get it, okay? Just stop. That sucks. I'm fucked, aren't I? I'll think of something. N-45. Maybe I can just switch schools. Don't be dramatic. Play your hearts out, ladies and gentlemen. Can I yell, "Bingo"? No. Please? You'll get me in trouble. Just-- B-9. Claire, stop. Bingo. Sorry. B-6. B-6. Hello. That's on the house. Thank you. Do you like his hair? I did it myself. Don't you have somewhere to be? No, obviously not. I-29. I'm chilling with you today. I'm so sorry. She, uh-- She doesn't work here. Hey. Yeah? Alison, yeah? Yeah. Claire? Can I talk to you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, it's about Henry. What about him? He's, like, really... complicated, you know? Mm-hmm. What's her name, again? Sally? Alison. Right. I think you should give it another shot. Eh, nah, that's not an option at all. You'd be surprised. What'd you do now? I told her that you tried to kill yourself. What? When? Before. Attempted suicide gets you more ass than a toilet seat. I can't believe you told her that. Just pills and a stomach pump, total cry for help. I also told her that you got kicked out of your old school for dealing LSD. Like, acid? Yeah. Just trying to put out a bigger story, okay? And she's into it. And if she's not, you just break up with her. I don't know how to do that either. Grade nine, it's easy. You just stop talking to her. Come on. Whoa, wait. Let's go talk to Sally. Hey, Henry, how are you doing? Uh, fine, I guess. This--This is Claire. Yeah. It's my friend. Yeah, we've met. You know, Claire, you're actually my senior buddy. I texted you, like, six times. We should probably go. So I'll see you later, Claire. Okay. Yeah, all right. Bye. Sorry. Awkward. Yeah. * When it all comes down * * I want to be with you * When it all goes down * * I want to see you Great. That's great. Okay. I think we're done anyway, so, let's-- let's cut. Um, that sounds great. So before everyone goes, my booking agent called, and, um, we are in the festival in Sault Ste. Marie. It's amazing. The festival is-- Like, the lineup is great. It's, like, Rock Plaza Central; Day, Month, Year; Plants and Animals; Boys Who Say No. Really? Couple of dates on the way back, Sudbury, Espanola, so plan for, like, 2 1/2, probably 3 weeks. A tour? Two weeks? So, wait. Okay, hold on. A tour? Yeah. Jimmy, come on. What? What, it's gonna be great. We have to-- We have to get out of this town and start building an audience again. So pack your lunches. Two weeks. Yeah. We're going on tour. You know, uh-- You know we have our gigs on Thursdays and Sundays. Every Thursday. Okay. Why don't we go to the Gem, and we'll just have a beer, and we'll talk about it. No, you know what? My sitter's done at 4:00. Okay, okay. But you're coming, right? Just because I've had a baby doesn't mean I can't come on tour, okay? Okay, Sweetie, good. I can't go. I already used up all my vacation on the recording. Okay. I can't just go on tour. It's a temp job. Take some time off. No, they made me permanent six months ago. I told you that. You either decide to be in the band, or you don't. Like, what-- I am in the band, but you have to check with the band before you book a tour. I have ten people's schedules in my head. I'm trying to org-- A 3-week tour? 2 1/2 or something. I'm going. Wait, don't you want to come for a drink? Uh, no. No, I'm cool. You're-- Come on, We'll toast-- Why? You're going to be talking about tour shit, apparently. Tour shit? I told you about this. Are you seriously going to Espanola with a funk band? Claire. That's gonna-- Claire. It's not the right crowd. You're so boring sometimes, okay? I'll see you. I'll see you later, okay? Okay. Nobody knows us outside of Toronto. ...wedding, and my mom had me wear this ridiculous outfit. It had frills on it. You know I don't wear frills. That's not me. What's up, Twist-off? Tiffany, I really don't want to fucking do this today, okay, so just shut the fuck up, please. Really? Yeah. You really want to start this? I--I just said I don't want to start this, actually. Whatever. I have to go to class. Let's go. Ohh! Ahh! Get off of me. Hey! Hey! That's enough. You were screaming like a little bitch. You had my hair in your hand. You saw it. Fuck. It's fake hair. Can't even feel it. You have a fake face. Whatever. You know what? Both of you, I don't want to hear it. Stop it. In my office, now. * You're so cold * You're so cold... And they were totally psyched to go to the show, right? Correct. And then I turn in, and it's a-- it's actually a gymnasium. A fucking high school gymnasium? Yes, and the booking agent says, "You said you wanted to play Edmonton, but you didn't say where in Edmonton." Did they play the show? Did they walk out? Yes, they played the show. No, no, no, they played it. They were fucking amazing. They totally rocked it. All the ladies are jumping, screaming. Hey. Hey, sweetheart. You are out of mints. Hey. I was just telling James what an awesome time he's gonna have on the road. Yep. So how's it going? Not bad. You're having beers with my mom in my kitchen. Ahem. Don't trust him, Claire. He's a musician. What? I came to see you. Me? You took off on me after rehearsal. Aren't you supposed to be on tour or something? You're funny. I'm not trying to be funny. Why don't you come? Hmm? Why don't you come on the tour? What, to Espanola? There is life north of Edmonton, you know, Claire. Really? Mm-hmm. Not interested. Come on, I'm serious. I was watching you the other night in the crowd, and it... could be like that every night. Hmm? When do you go? Wednesday. Or Tuesday. Hmm. I don't know. It's Wednesday or Tuesday. I can't remember. I guess you got school and stuff, huh? Yeah, I have a math test tomorrow. You should go. I usually put a little bit of mint in this, but Edward forgot to get the mint at the grocery store. Mmm. It's okay. These are fabulous, by the way. Oh, thank you. I made them for a fundraising bake sale. Mmm, for what? Planned Parenthood. Actually, I have a pamphlet here. Mom. Thanks. There's a number on the back. Oh. There's no such thing as a stupid question. Mom. "Your body--" Uh, Ruth, maybe we should, um... Oh, right. Yeah. I'll just leave you guys to, uh-- Yeah. Just... Have fun. Yeah. Yeah, see you. Have fun. Bye. Your mom's really friendly. She thought I was gay. Oh. So do you have any acid left? Uh, yeah, mm-hmm. Well, for personal use. 'Cause I was thinking that we could drop and go to the planetarium. Wow. Okay. Good idea? Yeah. Yeah? Hey. Oh, hey. What's going on? Henry's not here tonight. It's the Baby Seal Hunt. I know. We have different charities, have different nights. Planned Parenthood is Tuesdays and Thursdays. Baby Seal Hunt is today. It's pretty confusing. Yeah. All right. Well, see you. Hey. Actually... You think you want to handle my balls? You mean bingo balls? What other balls would I mean? My ball handler called in sick today. Okay. And I asked if, uh, you think can handle them. I think I can try. You got some confidence? Yep. G-55, guys. G-55. It, uh--It's the starting age for bingo. I-22. I hope I'm not working here at 22. B-8. Two fat ladies, B-8. Oop. Ow. Watch out. It'll get you. It's a very deadly game, bingo. O-89. Just keep it coming. These balls show no mercy. So how's school? I already got suspended, so I'm off to a great start. Fire alarm? No. Um... Tiffany McClintock. Mm-hmm. She called me Twist-off, and I... retaliated. Twist-off. Fuck. It's been a while since I heard that. Yeah. Yeah, I forgot about it. But I never believed those rumors, anyways. Really? Yeah. They were-- What'd you hear? I don't know. It's--It's crazy. It's crazy? Mm-hmm. Tell me. I heard you gave, like, 20 guys hand jobs at a--at a pool party. That's ridiculous. I know. That's fucked. You're telling me. It was a Battle of the Bands, and it was, like, 12 guys. Well, I guess you can see how things will get, uh, blown out of proportion, then. And it wasn't even 12 guys. It was 10 guys, 'cause 2 guys came back twice. Well, people are just exaggerating though, and... Yeah. You know, you don't even have to worry about it, 'cause once you're done high school, you know, you just-- It's like a vault. You know, when you're finished, it's sealed away forever, and you don't have to worry about it anymore. Really? Yep. Is this your wisdom that you're giving to me after two months of being a graduate? It's, uh--It is something that comes with having wisdom. You have to pass it on. Hmm. It's--It's a curse to some people. But you know what? It blows my mind that, um-- that even after all these years, people haven't even changed the--the name of, uh-- of your condition. My condition? You, it's a dis-- It's a plague. You have-- It's not a plague. I made a choice, whatever. You just told me that that's, like, okay. I'm sorry. And now you're telling me it's a condition. I--I told you, I live with my gut. Yeah, evidently. And there's so many, you know, that I've been thinking of over the years, you know, like-- You've been thinking about this over the years? No, you know, but-- Yeah? Maybe. You know, like-- you know, like Bushwhacker or, like, you know, Jerker Berserker, or, like, you know, Pipe Cleaner, The Conductor. Right. You know, or the--you know, The Carpenter, you know, 'cause you're just measuring all the time. Sawing away? Saw it, you know. Yeah. The Dabber, that's a new one, because I... That's a bingo-related one. It is. It is, you know. Mom? He said he might come by. He didn't even call. I don't think Bob's coming back, Claire. I think he's gone. I think he's really gone. Mom, it's okay. I mean, what have I got now? What the fuck have I got? I'm all alone. Hello. - Hey. Hey. Okay, why couldn't you tell everyone I got expelled for dealing hash? Pussy drug. Why? 'Cause the mix, anhydride and LSD, is really unstable. Are you trying to make it? My girlfriend wants to try it. She want to go to the planetarium? Yeah. Have you ever even done acid? No, and I'm not sure I want to. There's a big label on my chemistry set that says, "Do not eat." You want to meet at the park? Yeah. Okay. See you in a bit. Henry. You know that fish actually can talk? They can. What does that one sound like, do you think? Pfft. Henry, stop farting. Pfft. Ahh! You're terrible at this. You're so bad. Hey. Hey, drug dealer. Hey, groupie. Do you think I'm boring? Never. Why do they call you Twist-off? 'Cause I like to drink beer. Straight legs. Back. Fast. Back. Twist. Back. Whaah! See? That was good. Pfft. Blahh. Henry! I'm in jail. Henry, come closer. Come right here. Stop filming me! You see that? Where do you cut? Pie? I cut-- Is that good. No. You don't want that woody smell in this. Firm after you steam it, but not the woody bit at the bottom. Right. Right, yeah... What day is it? I got suspended. There's muffins on the fridge. Sweet. For Pete's sake, don't boil them. Tell my mother-in-law, please. She's not funny at all. Hmm. My kids just refuse to eat this. Just refuse. There's turbulence. So is this, like, your community service? Yeah, kind of. Uh, we got a game coming up, so you-- you better go. Sorry. Yeah, but did you bring it? Yeah. Here. Don't take a lot. You don't need a lot. How much do you want for it? Uh... I told them, like, 10 bucks each, does that sound about right to you? Sure, I guess. Henry, what's up, bro? Nothing. So I guess you can't come drop with us? No. I--I gotta stay here. Well, you're the best. Thank you. Let's go. Henry, having a good time talking to your friends? I'm sorry. They were just leaving. You know what? Let's just go change the popcorn grease, all right? Okay. So is that girl out there your girlfriend? Yeah, I think. Well, that's cool. I thought, uh, Claire was your girlfriend at--at first. No, we're-- we're just friends. Oh, no, I realize that. She, uh, jerked me off the other day. Wait. She what? Yeah, it was awesome, man. Dab it. All right. Well, tell Twist-off I say, "What's up?" Okay, why do they call her that? Hey, Twist-off! I gotta go. Come on. Twist-off! Twist-off! You there?! What the hell? Why are you here? What, did you follow me or something? Bingo hall guy? Like, actually? Okay, fuck. Oh, fuck. Henry, go. Okay. Yeah, my hair is blue. People think I'm a drug dealer. I almost lost my virginity in a ravine. Shh. Just-- What? Is that-- That's my fault? Yes, it's your fault. The-- The shoulder leaning and the kissing and-- and your pants off. Oh, grow up, Henry. No, I'm not some kid you baby-sit anymore, okay? Oh, my God. Calm down, please. Fuck you, okay? - Hey, keep it down! I thought it would be good for you to get out of your house, okay, and just have a life and just be happy and do fun things. Like a life like yours? No. No. I hear them talk at school, Claire. They're not shocked. They think you're sad. I don't care what they say. Well, I--I know you don't care. You don't fucking care, period. You're too busy jacking off bingo hall guy and fucking some other guy whose balls aren't even. Shh, shh. You're doing everything with everyone except for me. Okay. I'll fuck you. Is that what you want? Would that make you feel better? It might. Okay. Let's go. Not my house, yours. Henry! I want to talk to you! What on Earth have you been doing in the laundry room sink? Science Fair. Oh. Is it that time of year? Yep, Provincial Finals. Ha. What are you gonna do? Uh, a chemistry project. Ah. Yeah. Did you eat? Is this a joke? Why do you have all this shit? Hey, hey, hey, w-what the fuck is going on here? Why is this all here? You weren't meant to see any of this. Are you in love with me or something? Is that what's going on? No, I'm focused. What does that mean? I'm not--I'm not in love with you. You're not in love with me? You just have my fucking-- everything of me labeled and fucking-- Am I just a project or something? Is that what-- No. No. No? No, you're not. Hello. What am I, a fucking project? Oh, yeah. Okay, great. Just be fucking quiet while I-- This is my fucking underwear. Where did you get my underwear? They were in your bag once. And that just gives you a right to take it? You can just take it from me? We're done. No, Claire. Claire, stop. Okay, Jay, do you have the Pope-a-funk tape? 'Cause this thing has a tape player, dude. Hey. Hey. Is it cool if I still come? Yeah, sure. Yeah? Come on. Get in. Hey, guys, check it out. Look who's here. Hi. Ah, come on, Jimmy, really? What? It's no big deal. Should we talk about this? Well, we'll talk about it in the car. Come on. Give me the keys. I'll take the first shift. Come on. Hey, Travis. Hey. Welcome aboard. Thanks. Move your asses over. It just got a whole lot crowded. Jay, you're buying the coffee. Hmm. Are you feeling better, sweetie? What are you doing with your Science Fair project? It's done. Experiment failed. Oh, I'm sorry. It happens. Well, what are you gonna do next? I don't know. Physics, probably. No, definitely physics. No mess. Just me and my computer. Well, well... that'll be great. Oh. Okay, no, no, sweetheart, Liddy, no. It is not how high the fever gets. It's how quickly that it spikes. But how often are you checking her temperature? Okay, I know. Yeah, that one's an older one. But the-- It's a better one to take. Yeah, the one that's in our--I know. Well, can I talk to her? No, sweetheart, if she's sleeping-- No, if she's sleeping, don't wake her up. That's fine. Okay. I love you, too, but please call me. Okay. And please keep checking on her. And as I said, it's in--it's-- Yeah, it's the one in our bathroom. Okay. I love you, too. Okay. But call me. Okay. Bye. What's going on? Uh, Isabel, she's got fever. Everything okay? It's fine. Yeah? * Where is my man? * I can't find him * I just want to find him * In my bed * Where is his girl? * He can't find her * He's bound to find her * In my bed And I just wish somebody would come up with something different. You know what I mean? Jerker Berserker, something good like that, right? I mean, like, I would, like, look at the guys, you know, take 'em in-- stature, width, girth, you know, and be, like, "Okay, that guy's gonna jizz, you know, this many kilowatts." Except this one guy, his name was, like, Darren, or some shit like that. He had, like, a penis that was-- I didn't even know what to do with it. It was like a toggle switch. Like, it was so small. And I was, like, okay. So I figured out how to whuuh. He came so much, it was like Niagara Falls. Like, I should have had one of those fucking ponchos to cover me. That's-- That's pretty sad, Claire. Oh, man, not you, too. Don't do that. It's funny, man. It was, like, a crazy night. Is it funny? Yeah. Is it funny? I think it's fucking hilarious. So do I. Yeah. All right. It was crazy. Cigarette in school all the time. He was on the roof... Hi, honey. So I was thinking we could all go and get coffee, since we all have fourth period spares. Henry. Are you okay? Oh, no. Oh, no. No, Henry. Where are you going? Henry! No. No, no. No, we're here. We're here. We're at the fucking venue, and I can guarantee you that it is not happening. Are you sure this is the right place? Maybe it's not the right place. You're--Oh, you're sorry? I've got 10 fucking people beside the side of the road and-- Jim. I really need my phone, because you're using my minutes. I don't have a lot of minutes. Can I please have it back? Claire, could you shut the fuck up for one second, okay? Just one second. For once. This is the gig that's supposed to pay for the rest of the tour. James, it's my phone. How can there be lack of interest? I mean, there was Besnard Lakes, There was Day, Month, Year. None of 'em were into it. They all said no. Hang on a sec. I got a call. This is just what happened at the provincial park. What happened at the provincial park? Oh, Brian, that was fucking six years ago. I mean, seriously? You're gonna lose it on us now? You're gonna bring that up? Walking away. Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy, don't. I'm walking away. I'll go talk to him. Yeah, okay, fine. You go talk to him. That's fine. Can we just get back on the road? And we'll figure this out along the way, okay? What the hell are you doing? Where are you going? My baby's sick. I'm going home. What are you talking about? We have three weeks of shows. 'Cause I'm not spending the night sleeping in a van in Sault Ste. Marie. So I'll get you a room. Okay, whatever. We're going. What, you're going too? You're both going? I gave up another gig to do this. You owe me 300 bucks. That's just it? You're just fucking leaving? Un-fucking-believable. Can I have my phone, please? Yeah. Attention, A. Meighen High School. Today's day of school, there will be a fire drill today at 2:45. Two fingers there. That's good. Really?

Well, you know, good ideas come when you're drunk. It's been known to happen for me, too. When was this one taken? Oh, no, I can't. I can't tell you, 'cause you could do the math and figure it out. Oh, right, and then give away your secrets? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. You haven't changed a bit. Yeah, no, I have, just a little bit. Changed for the better, though, right? Thank you. All right. What's good here? Um, you know, I saw you play. I saw your band play at the festival, the Clark Festival. Oh, my God. Really? That was, like, 20 years ago. I think it was more like five. Yeah, it-- At least five years. God, don't remind me. You guys are amazing. I love the way you mix up the glam and the rock and the funk and the--the makeup and the costumes. I mean, it's just-- It's amazing. Yeah, I'm not sure if we'll be doing the makeup tonight. I was like--I think we might do a kind of stripped-down version of things. Lame. Can I get you a drink? Um... I would love a drink. Do you have I.D., honey? Claire. I--No, I would just have ginger ale, actually, or a Coke, if you got it. Can I get you a beer? Yeah, you talked me into it. * Yes, I pray * I pray * Sometimes I feel like a motherless child * * Wandering across the world * * It's so wide and so wild * Until I find myself * In a house near the river * * And I heard a voice saying * * It was my voice praying You suck! * Take me * Wash me * To the river Special delivery.

Yeah, sure. You know, you're still totally welcome to come with us. Yeah, I'm not coming. I'm gonna go. Okay. It's just I can't exactly leave you here. I mean, what are you gonna do? I called my mom. Yes? What? Okay. It's just we got this ferry to catch, and I don't--you know, it's the only one today. Man, go, okay? Okay. If that's what you want. Okay. Hey, bye. You know you have to be out of here by 10:00, right? Yeah. Okay. Have a good tour. Yeah. Okay, let's go. No, she's not coming. Well, she's a adult, so I don't know what you want me to do.

Okay, bye. * Stand, oh * Stand, oh * Stand, oh Fuck. Hello. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Nothing. Um... Where are you? I--I don't fucking know, actually.

Yeah. Sorry this is so fucked. But that'd be really awesome. Of course. Claire. You took a cab? I don't have a driver's license. Thank you. This belongs to you. I get it. It's creepy, and it's weird, but I also have 314 milk cartons, over 65 different species of beetle, and over 6,000 cat's-eye marbles. 6,000? Yeah. You're nuts, man. You are. You're crazy. Look at this. I totally remember this. We went to, like, a fish restaurant. Yeah. I think that was the only time I fed you. Remember? Pretty much, yeah. Yeah. Eww. Is that gum? Is this my gum?

You have no frame of reference. But am I wrong? No. We should probably go. Yeah. You have to let me back in. You're an adult, Claire. You can go to a community center and get your equivalency. I'm trying, okay? It's not enough. I'm sorry. Well, I'm going to, so you have to let me do it. No, I don't. Yes. No. Well, what am I supposed to do, then? I'm just supposed to, like, not have-- Then that's your fault that I didn't get a-- That's my fault? Yes, because I'm asking you-- You were absent. Well, I'm embarrassed, okay? Because I don't understand math, and it makes me feel like an idiot, and I'm lost, and I feel like I can't even concentrate, so I don't come to class, and that's why. And I don't-- Now I have a friend, and I think he can help me. You have a friend? Yeah. Hmm. And he's really smart, and I think he could probably help me. All right, people, wake up.
