Based on Hisashi Yamanaka's "Nandakahente ko" A film by Nobuhiko Obayashi Sabishinbo (Lonelyheart) Dedicated to the tragic, Dedicated to the tragic, radiant days of my youth. The landscape of Onomichi. Why is it so nostalgic even to those seeing it for the first time? For me, it's part of my everyday life. I made this tale to try and capture it. I was a very fanciful boy, probably because of this landscape. By the way, that's my home. The temple that you see. I'm the son of a Buddhist priest. That's my father, Doryo. For me, he represents what those strange creatures, "adults," are like. Expressionless and silent. You can only guess what they're thinking about. Look! Tatsuko's come out. Needless to say, that's my mother. When ever she sees me, she chants "Study! Study!" like it was a Buddhist sutra She doesn't have any feminine warmth. At night, she snores so loud that I've never had pleasant dreams. She's my exact opposite. By the way the girls walking here are students at Meikai Girls' High School. I go to Onomichi High School, which is co-ed, so there are girls... but I can't tell any of them apart from the boys. By comparison, these girls are treasures. Of course, this means that I don't know how to interact with them but I don't have to. I only need to see this one girl. For the longest time, I've played "hide-and-seek" with her in my viewfinder. Even among the treasures at Meikai, she stands out as special. Since this Fall started, she would always go to this empty classroom to play the piano after school. Let me introduce you. She's my Lonelyheart. I don't know why, but that nickname was born for her in my heart. Of course, I can tell that she's lonely and when I see her, I start to feel lonely, too. Because I feel lonely when I see her, I named her "Lonelyheart." I suppose it's a bit strange... but "Lonelyheart" is a nice name, isn't it? Hey! Lonelyheart! I'm not proud, but I'm very bad at music. When I sing, it sounds like I'm chanting a sutra. I guess that means I'll make a good priest. But for now... I only know this one song... playing from her fingertips. What a beautiful melody she plays! That's the only music I need to know. Before I tell my story, I have to tell you about this mysterious girl Hiroki! Sorry to keep you. Don't startle me like that, Kazuo! Are you chanting a sutra while looking at the girls? What use is it when you don't even have film in your camera? I can't afford it. I spent all my money on the zoom lens. My mother is making me pay her back. And I'm helping you work to pay off that debt. What a good friend I am! And I'm buying us meat. It's expensive! Oh, Makoto! Sorry! Mr. Yoshida kept me late again. He lectured me for 30 minutes! And we've got tough work ahead of us. Let's go. I'm sure my mother is already annoyed at me. -But Hiroki, it must be hard on you. -What is? -Cleaning the temple every month. -That's just the main hall. I clean the rest once a year. Move everything out and wash the floors. Being a priest's son isn't easy, is it? -I don't want it. -You're so strange. How can you not like chocolate? You know he got a nosebleed when he tried chocolate as a kid. -Do you have a chocolate allergy? -Shut up! Leave me alone. When I think back, the thing that started everything... ...happened that afternoon. You're still out messing around? Start cleaning! You too, if you want to stay here! Yes, yes, yes Let's clean up. Let's clean the house to chase out the demons. We broke it! Just think what we could do with this money! Don't leave any behind. Thanks for helping out today. It's fine, but when it's your nightshift -I'll get the veggies, you get the meat. -I know. -Buy some film! -But I don't have enough. Hiroki! Come up here and study! -See you. -Bye-bye. You came in without knocking again. I thought you were studying! This is serious. They're art photos. What kind of art is this? If you want to be an artist, practice the piano. I'm a son of the temple. My only instruments are wooden blocks and the temple bell. -It's culturally enriching. -But mom... why do you want me to practice the piano so much? And why "Farewell?" It's Chopin's masterpiece. Hurry up in the bath when your father finishes I'm famished! Let's go! Hold on! Inoue! -What do you want? -Look at this. What is this? -It's a photograph. -That's it? It's spirit photography. -This? -Hiroki! We'll be waiting. Give Hiroki a good scolding, Masuko! Wait! Why did you do this? Why is a pig flying over my head? I think it's cute. Really? The pig. Wait! Why are you using your energy on this crap instead of studying? You sound just like my mother. Of course! She's been asking me to help you study ever since elementary school. Let me go! You're so nosy. I'm going home. You'll regret it! -My art! -You call that art? I regret it! I used the last of my precious film stock to make that picture of you! It's gone! Idiot! It's ready. Do spirit photographs really exist? It's just a trick. Compositing. I don't know. You're being trained as a monk. Maybe you have special powers. Maybe you can take photos without film. By the way, Hiroki... -Shouldn't you refrain? -From what? -From eating meat. -Why? Monks aren't supposed to eat meat. He's right, you should stop. Here, I'll take this. Do you really believe? Stick with just vegetables. -Be pure in your training. -What is this? Don't you get it? Monks are forbidden from eating meat. We can't let you violate that. It may prevent you from achieving enlightenment. You'll go to hell. Or turn into a goblin. Making fun of a priest will bring you bad luck. We agreed to pay half back to my mother, and half on the food that we share. Don't forget: I can curse you with my photography. What are you saying? We did all the work ourselves. Don't look at us like that. I thought we were friends! We help you, now you want to kick us out I'll take this. Hey! What's that smell? As you were. I was wondering where it was coming from. What are you doing? You can't use school equipment without permission! You've lit a fire on my night shift? Turn that off. Inoue! If you keep the fire going, it'll burn the meat! Yes, sir! I'll take that. I'll get ride of the evidence. You can thank me later It's good. As punishment, you have to clean the principal's office. Get going! Hurry! I'll take that. I should have just bought some film. -But we helped you clean! -Now we're helping you clean again. -Good evening. -Good evening, Miss Omura! Mr. Yoshida just invited me to have some delicious food in his classroom! In times of doubt I shed tears During cold summers, I wander at a loss People call me a blockhead no one will sing my praises Nor will I be a burden. That's the kind of person I want to be. Well done! We'll practice again tomorrow. Yes! Come in! We were told to clean. I see! You're my office cleaners today! I'm indebted to you. -May we start right away? -Of course! I'll be heading off then. I'm counting on you! -Goodbye. -Goodbye. What a pain! You have to work to make it sparkling clean! Come on! Lead us to victory! -Catch! -It's wilted. I will not lose to the rain. I will not lose to the wind. I will not lose to the snow, nor to the summer's heat. My body is strong, unfettered by desire I offend no one. I always smile quietly. That's quite a clever bird. You think so? It just repeats whatever you say to it. Tan-tan-tanuki's big balls even without the wind... Come on, let's try! Tan-tan-tanuki's big balls even without any wind go swing-swing-swing! Tan-tan-tanuki's big balls even without any wind go swing-swing-swing! -See ya! -See ya! -Hiroki! Get studying right away! -Idiot! Aghh! No film! God! Buddha! ...Lonelyheart... Hey! Lonelyheart. Hey there! Lonelyheart! What are you doing? Hiroki! Say something before you barge in here! Why are you so defensive? Leaving that aside... Where are the rest of my pictures -In your photo album. -What happened when you were cleaning? It's a mess. I'm fixing it, but some pictures are missing. Oh, that. -What do you mean, "Oh, that?" -I'll fix it for you. Keep out of there! I don't want you defiling the memories of my youth. Your pure youth? Mom, what were you like when in your youth? My youth? I wonder... -Mom... -What is it? I need film for my camera... I just gave you money for film! I used it up already. You can't just go around taking pictures of everything. You have to treasure each photograph. But I do! Then what are all these prank photographs? Pasting them in with magazine cutouts. Is this what you call "treasuring?" -Did Masuko say something? -What is this? If you don't get better grades next term, I'll cut off your allowance! You can forget all about your film! How else can I get through to you? Hag! Demon woman! Dinner's ready. Come down quickly. So high and mighty. Who does she think she is? Who are you? Lonelyheart -Who was that? -What? In my room just now! What are you saying? Sit down. We haven't had any visitors all day. She was really there! A girl with funny makeup. -You sure you weren't dreaming? -I wasn't! You can't study because you get strange ideas looking at those pictures. -Pull yourself together! -What are you on about? Hiroki! -Good morning! -Good nose! That's why we devote ourselves to our children's enrichment at school. By the way, PTA President... I've spent a long time training him to say this... Go on. Speak! I won't lose to the rain My body unfettered Swing swing. The snow, the summer's heat Swing swing What did you say? My balls are strong, and unfettered by desire. -They go swing-swing -What the hell are you saying! That's the kind of balls I have In the summer's heat, swing, swing... What awful language! How can you train your bird like this in a school! President! Hey, everyone! They can't hear you! Who taught the principal's parrot to sing about balls? How awful! -Thanks. -Idiot! You three! Report to the principal's at once! If there are sick balls in the east, go and swing-swing them... If there's a tired mother in the west, go relieve her of those balls. Walking, swinging, in the summer's heat ...called balls by everyone... never praised, never being a burden. Those kind of balls I want to become. Swing-swing... It would help if you were strict with him sometime. I get so embarrassed for our family! I'm making him clean the cemetery as punishment today, but... don't we need to do more to stop him from doing these things? You just hit the bell... and I get called in when he makes trouble. Hey there! What the? Oh! Doryo? Thank you for helping! What are you saying, granny? It's me, Hiroki! Yes! Did you see the girl who was here just now? Yes. Who was she? -Tatsuko. -Tatsuko? No, not my mom. A much younger girl, with funny makeup on. Tatsuko's doing very well. Think hard, granny. Now sit down... Stick your arms out like this. You remember this from the senior's club, right? 1, 2, and 3, and 2, 4, and 5 Do you think you saw a ghost? She was pale, right? You're talking nonsense. You were in a graveyard, weren't you? You must have seen some young girl's ghost. Why don't you try taking her picture? I wonder... Why's he so late? Maybe he couldn't get away. Should we go to his house? His parents are probably making him work. Their shop is in the market. Should I go to the market like this? Goodbye! I'm going! Hey, wait! Congratulations! Here are your tissues! Thank you for coming! Congratulations! Here are your tissues. Hey, Kazuo! A working high school student! How nice! You're so dignified. It's rigged so tissues are the only prize, right?. I'm just the son of a humble merchant. -I'm looking after the family business. -Why not let us have some? I can't let you. It's only for shoppers. You're such a stickler. I thought we were friends! I'm feeling sick. I think I need them for my nose! -Hide! -Down here! -If you don't mind. -Thank you, PTA President. Thank you for helping me. I hope you draw the best prize! I have a slight cold, so I'd be happy even just to get tissues. If you draw a red ball, you'll get pocket tissues. -Go ahead. -A red ball? Golden ball! Golden ball! (also means "testicle") Even without wind... Swing, swing You three! The PTA President won the grand prize! -She has a golden ball! -A huge golden ball (testicle)! I won grand prize (huge ball)? Miss President! Thank you for coming! The PTA president is here? Grand prize! (Huge ball!) Huge ball! -What is it, Hiroki? -Where are you going? Swing, swing... Swing, swing... Swing, swinging balls. Swing, swing... How do you like it, Doryo? It's pretty good. But I'm Hiroki! I see, I see! Have some more! But granny... it's strange how everything is mixed together. That can't be helped. I was just using all of our side dishes. But you put the miso soup over rice. The sashimi is mixed in with pickled radish and potato salad. Is it just mine that's like this? I got hungry, so I just started mixing everything together. It's easier for old people to eat it this way. It's pitiful to have to forage for food in your own house like a thief. Here, have my yam, too. You're too generous. By the way... How's mom? Even though I look this way now, I was very nimble when I was young. I was called "Fuki the monkey." A monkey? Mr. Monkey... that's what I mean. Granny. What was my mother like when she was younger? That's no good! Trying to deceive me by practicing piano. Did you finish cleaning the graveyard? You made granny do it, didn't you? -Well... -It was supposed to be your punishment! You have to study these over winter vacation. So many? Even this isn't enough. If your grades next term are this bad, I won't forgive you. How can you complain when your report card was so bad? Shape up! Are you even listening, Hiroki? You! What the hell are you doing? How can you talk to your mother like that? Who the hell are you? Hiroki! Get out and go back to wherever you came from! What's gotten into you? Just now... there was... Are you making fun of me? Just wait! What's gotten into you? Who is she? Who the hell is she? Are you ill? That's odd. You don't have a fever. I'm sorry, Hiroki. I got a little upset. But you understand, right? I'm worried about you. Well then... Just so you don't catch a cold... bundle up and sleep, will you? Good night. Good night. I think I've finally gotten through to him! He got up early this morning. He's already left for school! Today is our last homeroom before fuyu yasumi, or "winter vacation." I'll be explaining how you should spend your time on break. In your 2nd year, you're not worried about entrance exams yet. It's very easy to get complacent and slack off. Look who's here! This is the most precious time of your youth. As an adult, you'll look back on the things you do now and cherish them. During winter break of my 2nd year I read all kinds of books. I remember reading this book above all: Little Women. The story of these four sisters was made into a movie, too... Please remove your clothes before entering for your physical exam. It left a huge impression on me. Elizabeth Taylor closes her nose with a clothespin like this... You really did it! You jerks! Hey! Lonelyheart! Yes? What are you? -Lonelyheart. -How'd you get in here? -It's a secret! -What? It's a skill I have. Don't make fun of me! I already told you. Are you dumb? Who said you could come in here? I came cuz you called me! -Hiroki! -Don't look at me like that. What is it? You're always getting in trouble, aren't you? Very strict, right? Who? Your mother. Do you know her? She used to be more laid back. Say something when I call to you. Was someone here? No one else is in here. Who were you talking to? She's not here. Right? Was she a ghost after all? Something's up with you, isn't there? Mom... Are you worrying too much? Cut it out! Never mind. Just go to sleep. Tomorrow... I'll give you some money to buy film for winter break. It snowed that night. Even in winter, it was an unusual sight in Onomichi. Still, it was gone within a day... and everything was back to normal. The excitement at the start of winter vacation quickly became boredom. The character "sa"... followed by the character "bi"... "shinbo," "shinbo" (Sabishinbo=Lonelyheart) is walking around. Hey! Lonelyheart! Even when I call for her, she doesn't show up again. Suddenly, all of my friends... seem so very far away. Nothing to do on winter vacation. All alone on winter vacation. Shit! I want to see her. Thank you for your hard work. Hello, Mr. Inoue. -Hello, ma'am. -Sorry to ask you here on winter break.! It's Christmas, isn't it? Do you have plans? No, I'm not that interested. My family is Buddhist. How nice! So few families are still observant. Hiroki! Hurry up! Masuko is here. I see her! Yo. What are you doing? What kind of greeting is that? I asked her to come visit. Oh. You must be very close if he talks like that By the way, Masuko, how was last term for you? -Same as before. -In what way? All A's. Wow! Hiroki's report card is all C's. She's lying. I only got a few C's. Mostly D's. -My stupidity must be genetic. -Hiroki! Who needs school, anyway? At any rate, that's why I've asked Masuko to come here. She'll help you turn a new leaf. Listen to her carefully. If you don't understand, she can explain it. You meddler! Where were you? You were so much more laid back when you were younger. Who are you? You're such a nag now! You're a hysterical old hag. Look in a mirror. You have horns sticking out. -Hiroki! Do you know this girl? -Well, sort of... Who are you? Where did you come from? You're ruining his fun. Don't be such a wet blanket! How can you talk like that to an adult? Serves you right! It hurts! It's tough for you, too, isn't it? Your mother called me because she thinks you're neurotic. But it looks like she's the one that's neurotic. Mothers can be like that with education. I'd better go. Take care of yourself. -You came back. -Miss me? Did I miss you? Ha! Don't you think your prank was too harsh? No, it was just right! Is my mother hurt? It's fine. She'll be back to normal tomorrow. She's like that. What are you writing? Never you mind. It's tough to be a high school student, isn't it? -It's gotten much more difficult. -What do you mean? It's easier for us. But I guess my grades aren't so good, either. Bad grades? You're a high school student, too? Second-year. Can I touch you? Sure. You're really there. Do I look like a ghost? Not that, but you do look awfully strange. I can't help it. It's how I look. Is that a Christmas Present? Nice! -Who's it for? -Lonelyheart. Me? Don't be silly! Not you. It's for the real Lonelyheart. I see. Of course! But I'd like it too. If someone gave me a present like that. -Be seeing you. -You're leaving? -I shouldn't distract your studying. -I'm not studying anyway. That's no good You should study! You must have lots of homework. Are you trying to be like my mother? That's right. First, study. Then, do your piano practice. I really like boys who study, and who can play Chopin's "Farewell." Hey! Even a walking dog may hit a pole Excuse us! Yes! -Happy New Year! -Happy New Year! Is your mother home? I'm sorry, who should I say is asking? Terue? It's been so long! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Thank you so much for coming! This is Mrs Amano. She was my classmate. Your son? He's an only child, so he's very spoiled. You reap what you sow! My daughter, Yukimi, is a 2nd-year high school student Nice to meet you. -We brought a gift. -It's not much, but I'm sure it's lovely. She's awfully cute. Daughters are so much easier than sons. Come on in. It's been so long! -How many years? -Who's counting? The cake looks delicious! Smells good. How nice. I'm surprised how good the coffee smells I know, right? Do you have plans for a New Years' feast? Most kids are playing on New Years, but your son is studying. How admirable! Before we know it, he'll be taking his entrance exam. All Yukimi does is play. I can't get her to study at all. But I'm sure her grades are good. They could be better, could be worse. Ignorance is bliss. When I talk to her schoolteacher about her, she says Yukimi's good at studying but needs more discipline. Since you've studied today, why not take Yukimi to play in your room? That would be very nice. Which way? Be careful. Here it is. Oh, shit! How nostalgic! My name is Yukimi Amano. You're just like her! That old hag Terue's your mom, right? That's very rude. Who are you? Have we met before? Your mother always feigns ignorance with her hands like that. What are you saying? "You didn't return the pencil I lent you during the test." "Oh, did you lend me something?" Like that! I don't know anything about that! Show me a liar and I'll show you a thief! It was very important to me, so I want it back. -What're you talking about? -Your mom! Terue's a dirty liar! Terue's a low-down thief! She's calling you a thief! Hold on. Who are you? -You look very familiar. -You're feigning ignorance again! Oh, you must be Tatsuko's daughter! But wait, didn't she say Hiroki was an only child? Listen, Terue, you old hag. Give me back my mechanical pencil. Mechanical pencil? -How do you... -And you failed anyway. You failed so bad they held you back a year. -Hey, how do you know about... -Mama, what's she saying? You failed at school? You said you were best in class! You were held back a year? You still have it! Don't say you don't remember. And you told me you had a tiger at your house, but you didn't say it was clay! And I lent you my handbag for your sister's wedding. But didn't give it back and feigned ignorance afterwards. You thief! Hey, kid! Watch what you're saying! Mama! You lied to me! What's wrong? How could your daughter talk like that? Your daughter? You again! Don't go anywhere! Mama! Are you a thief! Cut that out, Yukimi! We're leaving. Wait, Terue! I don't care what comes next. The future will take care of itself. What's wrong? Why did your daughter say those things? -What things? -I returned your handbag, didn't I? -What are you talking about? -From high school! -High school? -Even my grades! You were never a good student, either. And you snuck into my house to look for the tiger. And I gave you back everything anyway! That's why we stopped talking. Everyone stopped talking to you. We called you "Lonelyheart." Lonelyheart? Good day to both of you! It's not my fault! I don't know anything about it. Tan-tan-tanuki giant balls... ...even without wind... ...go swing-swing-swing. Through hardship... we achieve greatness. Even without wind... Swing, swing... -Good morning! -How are you? Good morning. Are you okay? -Tough break, huh, Inoue? -Cheer up! Hang on! What do you mean? Hiroki! Everything all right at home? What're you talking about? Did your mother have a nervous breakdown? -What are you talking about? -We're very worried about your mother. -About what? -Your mother! She started acting crazy, out of nowhere She was jumping all over the place! What are you saying? It's you, isn't it? You've been spreading rumors out of jealousy! Inoue, I'm glad you made it back to school. -I heard your mother went crazy. -You told the teacher! Of course! I was very worried about you. That's... She's just a little on edge. That's all. It's nothing Just on edge? Maybe we should pay her a visit. Sure, why not? Come on! There's nothing wrong. All right, everyone in the classroom! Let's go! Mom, what are you doing? Mom! Calm down! Get lost! Mom, what are you doing? A big cockroach jumped on the back of my sweater. A cockroach? I've hated cockroaches since I was a kid But mom... It's embarrassing when you run around screaming in front of everyone. At a time like this, you're father's out and you're no help. Did you see it? They're blue today! Get an ambulance! Is she all right? Try putting a cold towel on her head Don't be useless. I've seen enough. Ambulance! Take them all to the hospital! You're so stupid! Umm... This is a bit difficult to say, but What is it? I'd rather you stopped coming. Why? It's my fault. I still don't know who you are, but... you've made my mother go crazy. Or anyway, it happened after you came here, I guess so. She is my mother, after all. Please stop making trouble for her. What is it? Your poem was good. I like it. Here. Wash your face. You're so cruel! I'll die if I get wet. I think I did something irreperable. It weighed heavily on me. But on another day, out of nowhere, something like a miracle happened. What's wrong? The chain got tangled. I can't seem to set it right again. Um... I... Let me try! Thank you! I appreciate it. Can you hold on to this? You can eat some. I don't think it's right... I'm sorry. It's fine. It's gotten late. You'll have trouble lugging this back, won't you? I'll get help from somewhere. I can walk your bike there. -You don't have to. -It's fine. Umm... here. It's fine. I may as well take it all the way It's too much... Thank you so much. Oh, it's nothing. I wouldn't have missed this chance. It would have been hard for you to get your bike here, right? Yes, I guess so. And I've always wanted to ride the ferry Excuse me. It's easier on this side. Actually, I... I've seen you playing from my street. The piano? In a school classroom. I like to take pictures. I use my zoom lens to look at the classroom. That's how I "met" you. I always try to sing along with what you're playing. I always see this side of your face in my viewfinder. Just like now! I'm sorry for peeping. -Isn't it heavy? -It's fine! Anyway, you... My name is Yuriko. Yuriko Tachibana. My name is Hiroki Inoue. I have a very dull name. Actually, I know about you. I saw you on the way home from school once. Oh, you remember me? Yes. You play Chopin's "Farewell" very well. My mother has been making me practice it too. Your mother? My father's a priest, so he doesn't do much. -I live at the temple house. -By the big temple on the hill? So there's not much reason for me to learn piano. And I'm not very good at it. I just need to hit the wooden blocks, anyway. It was my dream to be a concert pianist. But it won't work out. I only practice on my own after school. I'll never be good enough to play concerts. Thank you so much. I can go from here. It's fine. I can walk you to your house. No, really. It's fine. But it's heavy. It's fine. I'd be embarrassed. Let me see you off here. I see. See you. See you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. Til next time. You! What are you doing there? I was waiting for you. It's very late. I asked you to leave. I couldn't help it. I was worried. Then why do you always create trouble for me? Don't worry. I'll go. Where are you going? She's a strange one. Good morning! Yuriko! Miss Tachibana! For example, Chopin's "Farewell," one of his most famous pieces, cannot be said to be a happy song. He had a tragic romance with George Sand and it remained deep in his heart. The so-called "poet of the piano" exposes his vulnerable heart and tells the story of a failed 19th-Century romance... Hiroki, let's hang out. I found this great store -Why are you blowing us off? -You find some friends you like better? -You fall in love with the ghost girl? -Shut up! Hold up. Was it that girl we saw? At your house? Oh, that? Wait a minute -Is something wrong with your eyes? -You're full of shit. It's definitely that weird girl. He's in love with her. What a lucky dog! -Why are you mad? -It's not her. Don't try to trick us. You're in love with her, aren't you? You sure have some taste. Really. That weird girl--she's your type? I said no. Too bad for that strange girl. Want some chocolate? Knock it off! That girl's got the hots for you. -Go back to her! -Go on! How nice for Hiroki! A freaky girl is waiting for him. Shut up! Get lost! I couldn't understand it. I couldn't believe it. I began to wonder whether Yuriko existed in this world... or if she was just a phantom. Why are you here?. -I have a present. -Why are you sticking around? Open it. What the hell is this? How cruel! You! You must know I'm allergic to chocolate. -It's not from me! -What? It was left at the front door, so I brought it in. I was afraid your mother would confiscate it. Thank you for the other day. You made me very happy. I was smiling the whole night after I got home. But... please don't look for me again. I'll remember you in my heart, but we have to break things off here. I'm very sorry. Goodbye Yuriko Tachibana Yuriko Tachibana. Is that your real Lonelyheart? I'm very sorry, but... I'd like to be alone. It's fine. I'll be gone soon anyway. You're going? Are you moving? -No. Actually, tomorrow is my birthday. -Your birthday? I'll become 17 years old. I'm only me at 16. So I can't become 17. I don't understand what you're talking about. Never mind. So, thank you for everything. Wait, Lonelyheart! I want to know something. Why are you Lonelyheart? What made you like that? Can I perform it for you. Like a play? I made it myself. One girl falls in love with an incredible boy but then they part. That's it? It's very romantic, isn't it? -Unrequited love? -The piano. Piano? The boy... Is very good at the piano. And when they separate... He plays that song... Chopin's "Farewell"... for the girl. That melody, and that love... the girl can never forget it. Her whole life? That's right. And the girl... she has a boring marriage to another man but her son looks just like the boy. And then... she gives the boy the same name as her childhood love. And then, she grows older. Falling in love with someone is so lonely. That's why I... am Lonelyheart. But... Still, I think I'm happier than the people who don't know that loneliness. See you. And remember... treasure her, too. Your Lonelyheart. Hey, wait! Who in the world... Hiroki! What's wrong? You hate playing the piano so much? You're father's still working. Why not take a bath and freshen up? Mother. When you were "Lonelyheart"... what were you like? I'm in here. There isn't room for both of us. I'll be done soon. -Feels good. -Oww. You've improved a lot at playing "Farewell" on the piano. Do you know the song? When I met your mother one of the first things she asked me was... "Can you play the piano?" "Do you know Chopin's 'Farewell'?" When she said "Chopin," I thought it was a type of bread. Your mother's always humming it, though so I always remember her question. It's her birthday tomorrow. Right. I'd forgotten. She'll be 42. We've been together for 20 years. Actually, I was thinking of getting her a music box that plays the song. I couldn't find one, though. You'll have to play it for her. That will make her happy. Why does mother like that song so much? She must have... some long-cherished memory. I just want to make her happy. I want her to cherish it, Hiroki Have you ever fallen in love? Fall in love. Fall in love with all of your might. Share all of their joys and sorrows. Silly! What do you say to that? For two? That's 1280 yen. Sorry. I'll just take one. For one, it'll be 600 yen. Perfect Thank you! Miss. Here, take this. Take it for your father. -I'm so sorry. Thank you. -Thank you. Yuriko I told you not to come. I'm sorry. I got you this Christmas present before I read your note, so I wanted you to have it. It's nice. Thank you. It's me who should say that. Thanks for the chocolate. Your kimono is lovely. Thank you. I'm happy to hear it. -It's a memento for my mother. -Memento? What's your mother like? She's always telling me to study. How nice. Goodbye. I guess we can't see each other again. I guess so. You said that you always saw me from the side of my face, right? Please try to remember me that way. Don't look at the other side of my face. Thank you for this present. Goodbye. Goodbye. Lonelyheart! You! How was it? Did she like it? Why are you out in the rain? You'll catch a cold. You told me you couldn't get wet! I wanted to say goodbye again. Silly. -Let's move you... -I'm fine here. It's fine. Just stay with me awhile. Okay. Thank you. You're warm. You... Can you come inside? I can't. I'm already wet. Hiroki I... I love you, Hiroki. Lonelyheart! Good morning, Granny! -Good morning, mom. -Good morning. -Happy birthday. -Thank you. What are you looking at? -This photograph is strange. -Photograph? Oh, it's Lonelyheart! Yes, Lonelyheart. That's what's written here. "Lonelyheart" Tatsuko Tanaka, 16 years old. Right. That's me when I was younger. Where did you get this photo? It was sitting here. Some photos flew out when we cleaned the temple Maybe the wind carried it out here. Now that I look at it that child looks just like me. Who was she, I wonder? Maybe I have been too obsessive about making you study. Mom... What is it? By any chance... Did you know anyone named Hiroki when you were young? A good student who liked the piano... who could play "Farewell" very well? A long time ago... I faintly remember someone like that. But now... the Hiroki that I love hates studying and playing the piano. There's a smudge on my makeup. It looks like I've been crying. But she's very cute. You think so? She seems like an odd one, but... a real beauty. Really? I really like girls like this. That's right. A mother is always her son's first love. I'm off. Take care. I wondered, then... what would have happened if a photo of my mother at 17 had flown out into the garden instead. But before I knew it, I forgot about it and grew older. That was good. If that hadn't happened, I would never have grown up. And then... Now, many years later... somehow, I became an adult. And I've learned to hide my thoughts and feelings like my parents. I chant sutras and hit the wooden block every day but I still see a girl who looks just like Yuriko from the side of her face while she plays the piano. And every day... I can hear the sound of "Farewell" playing from the next room. I wonder what you think of this. I wonder what Frederick Chopin would think that a song he wrote in the 19th Century about his own failed love even long after he's gone still resonates with each of us. Here's what I think: You once loved someone like this, too. Your own "Lonelyheart" 'Til forever Hey! Lonelyheart! When one person gives their love to another Whoever they are, they become a "Lonelyheart" Goodbye I was happy to meet you Promise to meet again somehow, somewhere I wish I could share my loneliness with you Stay in my heart, my unknown love A fading sepia photo for you Sadly, while smiling, shining I go to see you between the waves of time In the palm of your hand once more, Take me like stardust Lonelyheart Lonelyheart Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi Translated by smilethebeachboysloveyou Proofread by EvanM Timings from kagetsuhisoka
