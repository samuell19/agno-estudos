DO you want to hear the story of a man of God from the land of America? Straight from the city of Nashville, Tennessee? By today's standard, I've tried to be upright, just and one who fears God. Now, my life has not been perfect. Sometimes I feel like God is so far away and it's hard for me to focus and pray. I know we all want to feel closer to God and during life's hardest times when no one is there to hold you, you can't sleep at night, bills are past due, that's when we need to try and get closer to God. So, we pray some during the tough times. It gives our story, our testimony, it makes us stronger for those that witness and those that spread the gospel by deed and by word of mouth. Now, this is me, Keenan Robertson. I grew up fast raised by my parents in a rough neighborhood. Yeah, I made a few mistakes growing up, hanging with the wrong crowd, but I finally got it all together by the grace of God. And graduated from Tennessee State University. That's where I met the love of my life. We soon married and had a son. This inspired me to live out my dream and go to law school. I eventually passed the bar and became a lawyer. Always trying to atone for the sins of my past, helping others through my deeds day by day. This is Quentika King, a childhood friend of mine. I saved her life once when we were just kids by accidentally taking the life of another. Nowadays she helps run a criminal organization with an iron fist. We haven't seen each other in many years, but our paths are destined to cross on this day. - You know that's my old neighborhood, right? Yeah, I'm going to take care of it tomorrow. Sunday, right? Alright. [dramatic music] [loud banging] [water running] [moaning] - Good morning, honey. Get up, it's time for church. - [Kaysen] Okay, mama. - [Mrs. Robinson] Alright.

Bow, right here? - Let me see. - I don't know why I keep shifting. - It's okay, I fix it now and you look all good. - Shift, shift, shift. - We going to shift, shift, shift alright. We going to get ready to get out this door and daddy's making pancakes. - Pancakes! - Mm hmm, it's your favorite. - Pancakes? - Yeah. - Pancakes? - Mm hmm. - Pancakes! - That's how you feel? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I like it when dad cooks breakfast. He's the only one who knows how to make pancakes just the way I like them. - Really, well maybe when your daddy get this promotion, he'll makes us pancakes and cook food all the time. - Mom's gotta wash dishes. - Now, he know I got the dishes. - [Keenan] Absolutely. - I was about to say that. - You was going to. - Can I help wash them? - [Mrs. Robinson] You sure can. - She got the dishes, I got the trash.

Ridiculous. - Oh man, oh man. - So, babe, did you happen to catch the news and see what's going on in the media. There's a lot of evidence surrounding this case.

They found three dead bodies and a lot of dope in the house. You're going to have to start telling me the truth or I'm not going to be able to help you, Queenie. - I am telling you the truth. I thought if anybody be able to help me, it'd be you. [light music] - So yeah, this is a tough case, it's stressing me out. - You know it. - You know her, so what do you think? - You're going to have to play it out, that's all I'm thinking, there's too many characters in this for you not to play it all the way out.

[dramatic music] What's up family? - Hi, baby. - How you doing? - Good, how are you? - [Keenan] Pretty good, how was your day? - It was good but my feet are killing me. - [Keenan] Girl, I got you, put your feet on up here. - Daddy! - Hey son, how are you? - Good. - You have a good day too? - Been all over the place. - We've been all over the place. She ran around too much, that why she hurt her foot. - She ran around too much on her foot, that's what happened? Well look, in about 20, 30 minutes, I got to make another run out for work. - Where are you going? - Just got some work stuff, I'll be back in probably about 30 minutes. - It's late, dad. - I know it's late.

So, what's up? - Tash, I need some heat. - Some heat? - [Keenan] Yeah, some heat. Queenie, she done threaten my family, talking about if I don't get her off this murder case. - Mm, you know when I saw you face, I knew it was something serious. And you know I ain't forgot what you did for me. Just wish I would've got to you before you got married so I could've thanked you properly. - Tash, I'm serious. You know how we used to get down back in the day. - Like happy birthday? - Like happy birthday. - Dang, that's petty. But I got you. So, this is what I got for you. I got a box of bullets, 8 shot 380, two clips. I can even send my homeboy, Tank with you in case some shooting pops off. He's a good one to have around. You know, I heard before all of this popped off, she started working for Alvarez. - [Keenan] Alvarez? Why? Didn't that fool get in the 40 for pimping back in the day? He old now? - No, fool, his son. Once his pops died he took over the family business, so now he's running prostitution, the guns, the drugs from Tennessee to ATL, down to Florida, even out to Cali now and I even heard they give out them puking neckties. So, just be careful with her. She's connected to some people with some long money now. - Hmm, interesting. Well, I'm cool on Tank right now but I appreciate this. What I owe you for that? - No, Keen, you straight. - For real? - You know the streets talk right? Everybody respects your goal thought. They know you from here and you get people off. They see you on TV and the news. You like a little local celebrity. But for real, if I hear something I'm gonna let you know. Just remember this ain't the same Queenie we used to know. You might have to [clicking]. - I appreciate that. - No problem. [upbeat music] - Hello? Yeah, who is this? Alvarez? Hey man, I can't guarantee a not guilty verdict. Don't threaten me. - Them fools not going to answer the phone? - Mr. Robinson, Quentika King keeps on calling you and she done called every thirty minutes and she got a attitude, so could you please call her back because I don't know who she think she talking to, but she got the right one.

Somewhere hot. - Well, I think I missed a spot if you want to come back in here. Now with my family safe at my parents house, we decided that I needed to go meet this Alvarez character face to face to ensure my family's safety. This case, this situation is getting just a little close to home. [dramatic music] - My good people of the jury, this is a case of felony murder. The defendant is a known offender who has done everything from assault to drug trafficking. The evidence shows a criminal conspiracy with international ties to the mob and organized crime in several countries. The defendant was found with blood on her clothes from the victim. Now, it is your job to look at the facts and the facts point to the defendant as guilty. - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, yes, it's true that there was a gang of common criminals, viscous who robbed, drugged and attempted to murder my client. If she hadn't taken things into her own hands, self defense, she wouldn't even be here today to stand trail. She's a mother, an entrepreneur and a pillar of our community. It is your job to find the truth and to find my client not guilty. - [Girl] Make me nervous. - Mr. Robinson. - Yep? - So, how do you think it's going? - [Keenan] It's alright, man. - I know you haven't lost the case, that judge is being tough. And did you see the jury's faces when they said that she had blood on her face? - [Keenan] Yeah, man. I'm trying to tell you and plus look, to add insult to injury, I got a call from her boss yesterday, offered me 200K for a not guilty verdict and another three after the case is over. So, what's going to happen if I lose? - That's a lot of money. - [Keenan] Yeah, but they also threatening my family. I can't worry about the money. - Look, I'm not trying to add insult to injury, but the mayor done got involved. He wants a guilty verdict, ASAP. The elections are right around the corner. - Man, you land this on me today? I just told you I'm trying to get from underneath of this case. You talking about, man, take the case, be cutthroat, pull up your bootstraps and now look at us. Man, what's going to happen if I lose the case? What the mayor going to do, make a speech? It's still early. - Thank you, bro. But y'all no, no, no. - You can't even worry about. - I know man, it just be crazy, y'all swear up and down that everything y'all say is true. Like the gospel that you believe in. So called believe in. [buzzing] Y'all aint did nothing, y'all be talking about them firing me. Y'all been sorry since 99, since the 90s. I said, well, if you google 99 to now, we got a better record. - [Attorney] So, officer. Where you the first officer on the scene? - I was not. - Can you tell us what you saw when you arrived? - I got the call, shots fired. When I arrived on the scene, the young lady was standing there crying with blood all over the place. - [Attorney] How long have you been on the force? - About five years. - [Attorney] Five years. So, you are well aware of the policies of the NMPD and procedures? - Yes. - And on that day, did you follow those policies and procedures to the T. - To the T. - Did she have a weapon? - There was a weapon on the scene. - What caliber of weapon? - A 38. - Was that the same weapon that was used on the deceased? - It sure was, same weapon, same bullets. - Can you please identify the woman that you say that day? - Yes, she's right there. - Your honor, let the record reflect that the officer identified Ms. Quentika King, the defendant. Thank you, your honor, no further questions. - Defendant's counsel. - [Keenan] Detective, is it your testimony that you were the first officer on the scene? - I was. - And what did you observe when you approached my client? - There was blood everywhere, there was a lot going on. - Did you see a weapon in her hand? - I didn't. - You don't know if she was there preforming life saving CPR on the victim. - I can't say she was. - But you can't say she wasn't either, can you? - I can't say that either. - So, you're not sure who's weapon was there. [knocking] - Order in the court, we will not make this a media frenzy, do you have questions for the witness? - Yes, your honor. Are you a forensics specialist? - I am not. - And do you test the gun shot residue? - I do not. - And my last question, was the caliber of weapon used on the victim outside the same caliber of weapon used on the victims inside of the house? Remember, your under oath - No. - Your honor, I call for immediately mistrial due to lack of evidence and no witnesses to corroborate this story against my client. - You're pushing it, Mr. Robinson. - This is a mockery of justice. - We will not turn my courtroom into a media frenzy and anymore outbursts like that will get you a charge of contempt. - Do you swear to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God. - I do. - Can you please state your name for the court? - Quentika King. - And where are you from, Ms. King? - Nashville, Tennessee. - What is your occupation? - I'm a beautician. - Can you tell us your whereabouts on the day of July 20th? - I was out with some friends catching some Sunday sales and I had got a phone call from an old friend wanting to meet up, saying that they had some green. So, I went and met up with them. When I got there, I was offered a drink, next thing I know, I was tied to a chair being slapped in the face. - I understand this is difficult for you, take your time. You're in a safe place now. - And they kept asking me for money, but I didn't have any. I gave them my pin number to my card, but they just kept hitting me. I heard shooting and I knew I had to get up out of there. That man grabbed me and tried to take me hostage. - I just have one more question. Did you feel as if your life was in danger while you where in that room? - Yes, I thought I was never going to see my kids again. [suspenseful music] - No more questions, your honor. - Prosecution, your witness. - Thank you, your honor. Ms. King or should I say Queenie, is it true that you are the leader of the neighborhood gang called the Black Roses. - No ma'am, I'm from the neighborhood, but that doesn't define me. - Okay, so no gang affiliations, keep in mind you're under oath. - No ma'am. - Objection, your honor. Permission to treat the witness as hostile. This is a picture of the tattoo that she has on her arm when she was booked last year for assault. - [Keenan] Objection, your honor. Counsel is testifying for the witness. - [Judge] Overruled, I'll allow it. Please answer the question, Ms. King. - Yes, it's a picture of a rose which represents the power and the struggle of my people, but it's more of a lifestyle. - Your honor, can you please instruct the witness to answer the questions yes or no. This is not a history lesson. - Madam witness, please answer the questions yes or no. - Thank you, your honor. - Is it not true that you are convicted of biting off a rival gang member's ear just two years prior to this case? - I was being jumped and where I'm from, there's not such thing as a fair fight. - By any means necessary, right. On that bloody Sunday when we found you standing over dead mob lieutenant's body, was that a fair fight. - I was only there to get some drugs for my habit. One of the guys hit me and tied me up. They drugged me. What am I supposed to do? - Can someone please give me some tissue and cheese for that whine? - [Keenan] Objection, badgering the witness. My client is clearly distraught and upset. - [Judge] Sustained. - You don't know what it's like to be a woman in this lifestyle. Men always want they want and try to take what they can't have. If you're not strong enough, I just fought back. - And what lifestyle is that? The one you're not affiliated with? - I went in to get some green like I said. One of them offered me something to drink and I took it because I was thirsty, it was a hot day. Like a minute later, I remember feeling lightheaded, then boom, I hit the floor. And when I woke up, I was tied to a chair, being slapped in the face, punched and them asking where's the money? I panicked and when I ran, that's when I seen the police. They ran upon me. I've been in jail for six months away from my kids and I'm the victim. - So, you're the victim, right? No further questions your honor. The state seeks the maximum sentence. We as good, hard working Americans want to feel safe in our communities and not feel boxed in by the filth and the scum that wants to murder, steal and peddle drugs to our children. It is your job to administer justice and justice is blind. Don't look at the fact that she's a mother or has had a hard life in the past. No, look at the evidence and were it leads. And that evidence points to guilty. - They will have you believe that my client single handedly, by herself, with no help, took out two high ranking gang members and the mob lieutenant. After she was brutally beaten, drugged and tied to a chair. That doesn't even sound reasonable to me. So, we raise the fact of reasonable doubt, you must acquit. Now, the prosecution will say that she's a gang member because she has a tattoo. That couldn't be further from the truth. My client is a law abiding citizen. It is your job to protect them. And ask yourself a question. Has the state made you believe that my client is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt? If you can't answer that question 100 percent, then you need to find my client not guilty. She is the victim here and she deserves to go back home with her family who love her. Your conscious is pulling you right now in the right direction. Find my client not guilty and send her home with her family. Thank you. Hey Danny man, you think they buying our song and dance? - All it takes is just one and done. - Yeah man, and look, she doing all that emotional stuff and crying on the stand. She might just pull it off, man. - Either way, we screwed. If she gets off, the mayor's pissed off and she done threatened your family. We might just end up putting you off in the witness protection program. And not to mention the mafia that got you looking over you shoulder. At least you'll make partner. [laughing] - You paid the juror, right? She had the money, right? Cause they taking too long. Something's wrong and if I'm found guilty, I'm coming for them birthdays. You understand me? Rule seven. - Has the jury reached a verdict? - Yes, your honor, we have. - What say you on the charge of murder in the first degree? - We the jury find the defendant not guilty. - Order in the court. On the second charge of voluntary manslaughter, how do you find? - We the jury find the defendant guilty. - Order in the court, order in the court, Ms. King you have been found guilty of manslaughter. Order in the court. Ms. King, you have been found guilty of manslaughter which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Ms. King will be brought back for sentencing. - We demand an immediately retrial, your honor. - I can't do no 10 years. [screaming] [shooting] - Free the queen.

I'm just trying to see if you was straight. - I'm straight, man. You need to stay away from me. Everybody come around me ending up dead. - That's not true, you a good man. And God loves you. He wouldn't put more on you than you can handle. - That's was my wife, Tash. - I know. - I love her. I can't eat, I can't sleep, they took my kid. He's with his grandma everyday. I can't work. - I know, I know. I know. But I have some information for you. I know where Queenie is. - What? - My sister, Sasha, she saw her in Atlanta at the Fox Theater two days ago. Apparently she snuck down to Cuba with Alvarez and she's been hiding low. But her grandmother died, so she snuck back in the states. She's been by me, robbing dope boys like it ain't nothing. - So, Shasha. - You remember my sister. - Text me her number, I'm on my way to the A. Tell her I'm on the way. [dramatic music] Since I begin down this journey, I didn't really know what to do. Just dealing with the pain. Should I be seeking revenge or should I leave it up to God? Huh, I don't know. Yeah, I do know, but I'm still in the journey, so I guess I'll find out, really when I get to the end, trying to get closer to God. [dramatic music]
