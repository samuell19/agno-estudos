♪♪♪ Tony: Safe travels, everyone! Merry Christmas! Merry Kwanzaa. Happy Hanukkah. Tony: Bye! So long! Tony: What? Allie! - Hi! - What's going on? Wow! What are you doing here? I just thought I'd come by and say hello and... Maybe see if you needed any help here at the community centre. Oh, no. What happened to your job at the middle school? Budget cuts. - The arts always gets it first. - Hm. They said they might rehire people after the new year but I could really use a job during the holidays. I really wish I could help out but of course, I'm all staffed up by volunteers here. Plus all the other folk just left on that bus to go to The Bahamas. So, there's no one left here to look after. Tony, can you help me with the decorations for the Christmas tree? Connie, I thought you were on that bus to The Bahamas. What's going on? What and leave you here all alone for Christmas? Don't be silly! And here I thought I had a week off. Well, can you keep the centre open just for one person? Tony, the TV in the great room's on the Fritz again. I'll deal with that in a minute there, bill. Okay. Make that two persons. Yeah. (Exhales sharply) Okay, you're hired. I wonder if you could start today. (Chuckles) Tony: Do you know how to fix TVs? ♪♪♪ Connie: (Scoffs) What's wrong? You look upset. Of course I am. This is supposed to be an angel with wings and it looks like a pigeon exploded. (Chuckles) It kind of does. I'm Connie. Nice to meet you. I'm Allie. Are you Tony's girlfriend? Oh, no, we're just friends. We went to school together. Oh, okay. So no spark or anything, huh? - No. Not really. - No. Okay. (Sniffs) Allie, sit down. Take a load off, talk to me. So you didn't want to go on the Christmas cruise, Connie? Oh, and leave poor old bill all by himself? Connie: You see, he told me that he gets seasick. So a cruise is out of the question. And I just thought I'd stay behind to see if I can help him, the poor dear. Oh, so you and bill are a couple. Allie, that's awfully personal. Oh, okay. Tony: Good movie? Nah, there's nothing on. (Sighs) Bill, wouldn't you prefer to be at home? Where you could put your feet up and crack a beer open? Well, to be honest. I didn't want to leave Connie all by herself. She doesn't have any family. And when I found out she wasn't gonna go on the cruise, I thought to myself, heck, I can't let her spend Christmas all alone. (Whispers) I told her I got seasick. Seasick? Yeah. Bill, weren't you a captain in the Navy? Well, yeah, I commanded a cruiser in the pacific. I had dreams of being an architect when I was a young pup. But my dad and my grandpa were in the Navy and I just followed in their footsteps. Well, you know, that's something we could take care of in the new year. We could arrange for you to take architecture classes or something. No, no. I'm too old to get involved in that kind of thing anymore. Well, I don't know. Maybe there's ways for you to stay young. Connie: (Chuckles) Huh? Sorry? Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, of course. Well, why don't you let me know if you need anything. Sure, Tony. Yeah, thank you. Listen, we are gonna have all the activities that we planned to have this week, aren't we? Yeah. Looks that way, bill. Seasick. So, let's cut to the chase. How goes the search for Mr. Right? My search? Oh, I'm not looking for Mr. Right. Oh, honey. Don't kid a kidder. A good-looking gal like you? Not in the market for a sweetheart? Well, actually, I just got out of a relationship. So I'm kind of putting all that on hold. Besides it's hard finding the right person. What, are you kidding? With all the snaps and apps and tubes and tweeties I bet you I can find you a good catch in two minutes. - Here, give me your phone. - No! No! Well, would you like to meet my grandson Nathaniel? He's very handsome, lovely smile. Nice boy. Oh. No, thank you, Connie. I could find my own dates, but I'm not really in the dating frame of mind right now. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well, I guess love can wait while we finish our decorations, but just remember, keep your eyes open. You never know when you'll find Mr. Right. You were just missing the angel's head. That's beautiful. Thank you. My pleasure. (Chuckles) Allie! Wait up. Wait up. Thank you for all your help today. Oh, it was my pleasure. Bill and Connie were very entertaining. Yes, if by entertaining you mean a handful? Absolutely. I'd hate to lose you after just one day but I thought maybe this might be of some interest to you. What is it? Looks like a help wanted poster. It's on the bulletin board "the Santa squad can help make your Christmas dreams come true. Do you need someone to help shop for you, decorate your tree, wrap presents? The Santa squad offers a ho-ho- whole range of services to help make your spirits bright all season long. I'd be perfect for this job. Right? First of all, I love Christmas. I can vouch for that. I've heard you sing "jingle bells" in July. I can shop. Christmas shopping is so much fun! I decorate. I've decorated numerous times. I could almost call myself a decorator. Too far, I think. I'll call them and see how much they pay. Tony: Great. They'll probably make you wear one of those elf costumes. No way. That's too corny. - Is it? - (Both chuckle) Could you point me to the hiring office? Right over there. Oh. Um, hello. Oh, hi. Did you bring the pastrami sandwich? No, I'm here about a job. Oh, well, that's too bad. So you're not hiring? No. No, I meant too bad about the pastrami. Oh, right. Okay, but you are hiring. Oh, yes. Yes. We always need elves. Tell me, what kind of elf work have you done? Up until recently, I was an art teacher at a middle school. So we had to do a lot of artsy things that required artistic skill. Oh, and i'm in charge of decorating the community centre for the holidays. Six big rooms with a Christmas tree in each one plus handmade streamers, life-size reindeer made out of chicken wire and papier maché. Oh, for the love of... Would you look at that? Oh, um... Oh. There you go. Oh, ho ho. Nicely done. Yes, good instincts. Excellent problem-solving skills. Oh, yes. I have those as well. All right, I'm gonna give you a hypothetical. It's Christmas Eve and you get a call from a guy saying he forgot to get his wife a Christmas present. What do you tell him to do? - Oh, um... - Tick-tock, Christmas Eve. I would tell him to clean the bathroom. Excuse me? Make that bathroom shine like a diamond. That's what I'd say. All right. I think it's a little... Okay. Hello, doll. It's me. Let me ask you. What would you think if I cleaned the bathroom by myself? Really? Oh, really? Well, thank you, my love. All right, bye bye. Well, you just got my wife to say sweet things I haven't heard in years. All right, I'm gonna give you a shot... The church file. The church file? Yes, it's a very important job. One of the biggest. Talk to Holly, Holly at the counter and she'll get you all squared away. Oh, and thanks for the gum balls. Church file. [Choral music "ode to joy"] This isn't a church. This is bigger than a church. This is bigger than a cathedral. [Car horn] You're in my way. Oh, sorry! Sorry! Oh... (Scoffs) Now you're in my spot. Oh... Oh, I am so sorry. This is my first day here and... Alrighty then. Oh! - Yes? - Hi. I'm Allie from the Santa squad. The personal holiday serv... I'm Daniel Hyde, Mr. Church's personal assistant. Come, come. Oh. I'm so sorry. I was in the driveway and I... Oh, wow! That's kimmee. That's Mr. Church's lady friend. Mister...? Oh, church is the family name. For some reason, I thought I was going to an actual church, but then I thought why would they gift-wrap? It's a church, but then I thought what the heck, maybe they have some gifts. They want to give to the people... You'll be assisting Mr. Gordon church and his daughters, Iris and Rose. Did you bring a resume? Oh, yes I did. And you've been alerted as to your responsibilities and obligations vis-a-vis the church household? I mean, they told me that I was responsible for taking care of setting up for Christmas, you know, the presents, decorations, et cetera. Any outstanding warrants? Outstanding? No. Liens on your personal property? No. Speeding tickets, unpaid or otherwise? No. Excuse me, I'm sorry, but Mr. Karl at the Santa squad already went over... One moment, please. Yes, sir. Yes, she's here. I will, sir. Oh, and you asked me to remind you about the Tokyo call. The paperwork is on your desk. Never a dull moment. One moment what other kinds of guidance did you receive from the Santa squad group? They gave me a list of do's and don'ts. Just general stuff. A job's a job, right? The church residence is not like other jobs. There are very specific rules we like to follow. Rules that have been put into place for very specific reasons. Oh, okay. Like what? I beg your pardon. What are the specific reasons for the specific rules? That's not your concern. I just thought if I knew the why it would help with the how. Charming. These are the interior decorations. Garlands for the mantle, holiday candles, etcetera. One box for the whole house? Is that a problem? No, not at all. I'm just... it's just... I'm sure there's a very specific reason. Please continue. These... Are the tree ornaments. Each one handmade, each one quite expensive. That's really impressive. So be quite careful with those. The tree is in the family room. Oh, yes, sir. Yes. I'll be right there. Familiarize yourself with the contents then come to the family room. I'll meet you there. Arigato gozaimasu, sato-San. Okay. How does it look? (Sighs) I told them tapered. No, it needs to go back. How's the new employee from the Santa squad? Does she seem up to the task? That remains to be seen. How so? She's a little chatty. But not obnoxiously, sir. She seems scattered. But perhaps it's the adrenaline of starting a new position. As long as she gets the job done. If I may ask, how did your call with the Japanese CEO go? Well, he's not on board yet. I feel like they're waiting for us to try something new, something that'll knock their socks off, but I'm just not sure what that is yet. Are smoothies healthy in direct relation to how awful they taste? Ugh. Eugene will have the jet ready to roll at six. You're meeting the football team owner in his private box. And the girls? Iris is practicing her flute. Good girl. And Rose is studying for her last test before the holiday break. Good. You know, I just wish that she'd make some time to have some fun while she's still young. Is something funny? No. No, it's just the idea of Rose having fun would be so unusual. She's so studious most of the time. No offense. I know that she is, Daniel, and that's on me. I'm... I've been neglecting them. You'll have more time after the holidays. Yeah, of course. Thank you, Daniel. (Exhales sharpy) Hm... Hello. Hi, I'm Iris. I'm 8. Hi, I'm Allie. I'm... pleased to meet you. Do you work here now? Um... looks like it. Are you a gardener? No. Masseuse? Chef? Artwork restoration technician? I'm here to help out for Christmas. This Santa squad? That's right. Do you think it would be okay if we did a little more decorating than we did last year? Well, I wasn't here last year, but, sure, we can have some fun decorating. But I'd like to speak to your father first. Make sure it's okay. You can do that right now. ♪♪♪ Oh. Hi, Mr. Church. I'm Allie. Gordon. Church. The folder, sir. Hm? Right, right. Oh. Everything you need is in the Christmas folder. Perfect. When should I start? How do you feel about starting right now? Oh. Sure. Just let Daniel know what you need and meanwhile, we need to think of something to impress the Japanese. We need something bold for the presentation. Can you write it backwards? Come again? The Japanese, they read right to left. That's why their books seem like they're backwards to us. We read left to right. If you don't mind. No, no. Hang on, hang on. Go on. I'm just thinking. I teach art to middle schoolers. And we like to show them how different cultures do things. Maybe the Japanese would appreciate it if your presentation matched their cultural style? That's a great idea, um... Allie. That's a great idea, Allie. Thank you. Goodbye, sweetheart. Are you going somewhere, daddy? Yes. I am going to a football game in Florida. Why can't you just watch it here on TV? Because I'm not really going to watch the game, pumpkin. But you just said... I know it's kind of confusing but I will be back in the morning, okay? Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Alright. You can get yourself squared away? Sure. Okay, then. Kimmee. Gordon. Hi. Uh, I was just getting Allie set up. She's with the Santa squad, the people that come to your house and do the... Yeah, we met outside. Allie, is it? Yes, I'm Allie. Allie, in the future, you can park in the back by the servants' entrance. Would that be okay? Oh, fine. I'm sorry about earlier today... Is the Florida trip still on or do you need to help Allie some more? Let's go. ♪♪♪ Allie: (Exhales sharply) Hi! You must be Rose. I don't know if I must be. Who are you? Oh, I... I'm Allie. I'm here with the Santa squad. I'll be helping out around Christmas. Gift-wrapping, decorating, all that stuff. Did you know that some sharks can live up to five centuries? No, I didn't know that. Did you know that the heart of the shrimp can be found in its head? I didn't know that either. Can you guess which animal features prominently in the Christmas song "the twelve days of Christmas"? Um... let me think. Birds. French hens, turtle doves geese, swan and the infamous partridge. You're right. No, I never thought of it as a song about birds. There are those who theorize that five golden rings relate to the ring-necked pheasant. I'm not so sure. I see. Well, you have to be sure. It's vital. Well, maybe "jingle bells" is really a song about birds that... I don't know, make a jingle sound. Birds don't jingle. (Scoffs) Nice to meet you. Whew. ♪♪♪ Gosh. Iris: Do you like that one? Yes, it's amazing. Iris, do you want to help decorate the tree? We could ask Rose, too. We're not allowed to touch those decorations. Well, that's too bad. Decorating the tree is one of the most fun things you can do at Christmas time. Not around here. Well, does your family have any ornaments that aren't so expensive? I mean, these are incredible but do you have some personal ones you girls made in school? They don't do stuff like that at the kinds of schools we go to. Now the Christmas gifts have been ordered and should be arriving within the next few days. So, all the gifts are being delivered from online stores? Yes, of course. Would there be any opportunity for me to do any private shopping? I'm very good in a mall. Be that as it may this is how we sort the Christmas gifts. Now, most of them will come wrapped. But you'll be responsible for taking care of the ones that aren't. I'll be expecting perfectly creased corners. Nothing gaudy. Conservative bows. Classic colors. Oh, about that. I saw the most amazing cellophane shells. You just slide it over the gift boxes and you top it with shredded bows... - No. - But... No. Are we clear? Yes, we are. The girls are adorable and the dad, he seems nice, but the house just feels empty, lifeless. Yeah, well, the way you describe that big old mansion sounds like it'll take a hundred people are more to fill it up. So the dad, Mr. Church, he's dating this woman. I think she wants to scratch my eyes out. I'm sure you just imagined it. Oh, she looks at me like. Oh my goodness. I... I'm sure it's nothing. (Laughs) I just want to loosen the girls up, you know, find the joy of Christmas. All they need is a little guidance. I don't know, Allie. Don't get involved. I think you should just walk through these next few weeks, but a little something in your bank account. Hit the ground running for the new year. Maybe I can bring some creativity to the job. Change things up in the church household. Uh oh. You're getting that Lucille ball look in your eyes. There it is, that's it. I don't like it. What are you thinking? Well, first of all, can I use some of the community centre's leftover Christmas decorations? Of course. We've got enough to last us a few years at least. Well, we've heard of the Christmas presents list. Uh huh. The naughty and nice list. Sure. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we introduce to you the master list of fun Christmas activities.

Yes, you go do that. - Go. - Yeah. Go. (Scoffs) No. Did you know that snails could sleep for 3 years? Yes! And slugs can have four noses, huh? Huh! Well, it actually reminded me that sometimes we can get stuck for a long time doing the same things over and over when there might be a fun way to break the routine. How so? Well... maybe you could take a break from your studies and help Iris and me make homemade Christmas tree decorations. It's next on the master list of Christmas activities. (Chuckles) That's not a real thing. Is it? Well, no. But it sounds like it can be fun. - Yeah? - Yes. Great! Is... is that glue gun? Yes, and I have pipe cleaners and sparkles and scissors and construction paper. Because...? I thought it'd be fun for the girls to make their own ornaments. Kind of get in the spirit of the season.

Do you guys get your dad a present just from the two of you? I can help you do that if you want. I can't think of anything he doesn't already have. All the Christmas gifts for us have been picked out. They're in the folder Daniel gave you. Right. Yes, I did see that. Allie: What about getting him something a little more personal like a handmade card or a poem or a photo album? Something from the heart. We don't really do those kinds of things. Iris: Daddy travel so much we just got used to picking out our presents from catalogs. But don't you guys ever want to be surprised? And receive something we didn't ask for? Allie: Yeah! Maybe get a present you didn't know you needed. Rose: Like? Like a bicycle? We already have those. A puppy? I'm allergic. Okay. Allie: Oh!

I heard you persuaded the girls to help you. Oh didn't take much persuading. They were really excited to pitch in. Really? Even Rose? - Yeah! - Hm. I think when kids are young they don't realize the fun that can be had with simple activities. They're all so fixated by their devices and screens.

You threw them away. No, I was just... Iris. (Scoffs) Okay... (Clears throat) Hm. Everything changed when that woman walked into our lives, Gordon. I mean she has filled your house with cheap decorations and she has absolutely no respect for the amount of hours that I put into decorating this magnificent tree. Oh, and worst of all, worst of all, she has completely taken over the affections of the girls. Kimmee, the Santa squad thing was your idea. You didn't want to have anything to do with decorating the house or shopping for presents. You said so yourself. I was planning our trip to the the islands. And the girls respond to her because she makes the effort. Well, I painted their nails once. Okay. (Chuckles ruefully) Kimmee, I have two daughters and nothing's going to change that fact and let's be honest, spending time with them, it hasn't been your highest priority. Is it yours, Gordon? No. No, it hasn't been. Yes. Exactly. And that's why I thought it might be a good idea to consider boarding school for the girls. Boarding what? Don't get me wrong. I know the transitions going to be rough but... but... I thought I could help you with the transition by moving in. So you want my girls to move out so that you can move in. Yeah, it sounds like a win-win, doesn't it? Actually, no. It doesn't. Gordon: (Scoffs) (Exhales sharply) What are...? Gordon, what are you...? Gordon. Gordon? Why can't she just leave? We need a Christmas miracle for that to happen. [Knock at door] Hey, girls. Uh... I just wanted to let you know it kimmee and I... We've ended our relationship. Nothing else is going to change. I'm still here. Our family's gonna stay together and Christmas is gonna go on as planned, okay? Just let me know if you have any questions, alright? Oh. Now tomorrow... We're gonna go find another tree. One that we can decorate ourselves. - Really? - [Gordon] Yeah. Make sure to tell Allie. Good night, you two. Rose and Iris: Good night, daddy! - Yes! - Yes! Kimmee's gone! (Laughs) Best Christmas ever. I know! (Laughs) We should get a big tree. We already have a big tree. Then we should get a bigger tree. Well, if it's too tall, we're going to be making decorations for months trying to fill it. Whoa, that sounds like a lot of glitter. Would it be against the rules if we maybe bought a few decorations? Allie and girls: Yes! Gordon: (Laughing) Okay, okay! Rose and I are gonna look over there for Christmas trees. But there's lots of trees right here! But the ones over there are really nice. Oh, right! Yes. Iris and I I will be at the opposite end of the lot. Way over there, in case you were wondering. (Giggles) Duly noted. I think my girls are having some big ideas. Seems that way. You know, when I was a kid, my father used to shake the trees and if the pine needles fell off that meant that they were old and that it was probably going to dry out. So it's almost like a science. Give it a good shake. Work it out. You want to be a savvy consumer, right? - Uh, sir? - Huh? Would you mind not shaking the tree? Oh, sorry. Yeah, I was just seeing if the... Yeah, I know. It's an old wives' tale about the pine needles dropping. Trees come pretreated nowadays. Oh, really? Well, uh, thank you very much. As you were, carry on. You learn something new every day. (Chuckling) Yep. I'm about to get us kicked out of this place. They're smiling. That's a good sign. Are you sure they're not grimacing? It's hard to tell the difference from this far away. Who grimaces in a tree lot? Good point. They're probably smiling. Allie, I just want to say thank you for spending so much time with the girls. I know it's not in the job description. Oh, no, I love being with them. They're so interesting and sweet. They make the job a real pleasure. I'm not sure if you heard but kimmee and I, we... No longer seeing each other. Yes, I heard. Sorry. No, it's fine, really. It's been a long time coming. We haven't been in a good place for months. I think that she was a little bit jealous of the way that you and girls hit it off. I hope I didn't cause any problems. No, you actually helped me see a problem that was there from the very beginning. [Cell alert] Excuse me. (Chuckles) Good news? We closed the deal with the Japanese. They loved that we revised the presentation based on your suggestion. Thank you, Allie! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I, uh... I got a little carried away there. Of course, perfectly fine. I'm just glad I could help. You know, it's funny. Sometimes the thing you need is right in front of you but you just can't see it. Yeah. And then when you do see it, you can't believe you didn't realize it all along. Yeah. We found a tree! It's the perfect size! And we did that shaky thing you taught us.

This week I've seen a spark in the girls that I have not seen in a very, very long time. Yeah, they're just getting excited for Christmas. That's part of it. But mostly it's because of you. Gordon... Please don't take this personally, but have you put any thought into spending some more time with the girls? I mean after Christmas is over? Of course, it's on my mind all the time. I think it's on theirs, too. Really? Did they say something to you? Not in so many words, but I can tell. It's just my schedule, you know, it's impossible. But you have the ability to say yes or no to meetings and trips though, right? When I was a kid, my family, we had nothing. When Christmas came around, as a kid, all I wanted was one bike, this... they call them spider bikes. They have these really long seats that were amazing. These high handlebars, and every other kid in the neighborhood had one but not me. And I told myself that when I grew up, I'd be able to buy myself one of those bikes. So I set out to create my business, my company, and I worked very, very hard and eventually I became CEO. Did you ever get that bike? (Laughs) No, no. No, by the time I was successful I was too old to care about it anymore. But my point is that my girls will never go without.

I woke up early on Christmas morning and I crept downstairs to find my dad asleep on the floor snoring like a jet engine. All: (Laughing) He had stayed up all night to put together this Victorian doll house I'd asked for. He was all thumbs. He couldn't replace a light bulb without hurting himself. But it didn't matter. Somehow he built this Dollhouse and it... oh, it was so beautiful. Every little detail. [Smoke alarm beeps] (Gasps) What's that?! [Smoke alarm continues] Fire!

Gordon, I... I... There's mostly smoke damage. But if that fire has gotten any larger, the gas line would have caught and then we'd have had a really serious problem. I don't know how this happened. Allie, how could you? Did you even stop to think how dangerous a fire could be to my girls? How could you be so careless? You could have burned down the whole house. But I... Gordon: Look, I'm sorry. This is unacceptable. You're done here. What? Dad? No! They're all I have, Allie. ♪♪♪ [Footsteps recede] Hey, it's okay. Come here. Connie: (Gasps) Hi! Guess...

Look, this can be a rough time of year. I'll say. Say, do you want to hit the town, just us two single ladies? I do a mean chacha. (Chuckles) Oh, I don't feel like dancing. I hardly feel like walking. You really are low, aren't you? I'm just feeling sorry for myself. Because you care about someone you're afraid they don't feel the same way? No, they do... he does. I think. Really? Then why are you here instead of there? Ugh. It's complicated. You know, people get their heart set on something and they hang on to it with both hands, even if they know it just might not come true because it gives them a feeling of hope.
