'Greetings! Welcome to the Newshour!' 'Special Team has been set up' 'to trace Inspector Rajendran of' 'Gummudipundi J7 Police Station' 'who went missing mysteriously two days ago.' 'The team will begin investigation' 'after they get cue on whether' 'the Inspector is abducted or murdered.' 'The missing Inspector Rajendran' 'was working on capturing a drug mafia.' Brother! Come before me. Sorry, Brother. The pain is killing me. If you continue to taunt me like this I'll smash you to the ground! Do you follow? Whatever it is face me and say it. Sure, Brother. Brother, Bhai is here. Bhai? - Yes! You! - Don't, Bhai! I will drop dead with just a gentle touch! You are no Collector or Judge to corner a Police officer! A smuggler should never react. Staying calm is the key! Only if you respect the cops, you will be successful in trade. Whereas you have laid hands on a top cop! I did try, Bhai. The cop didn't budge. In fact, I even fell at his feet. But, he strangled my neck. It was a narrow escape. Do you even realize it? The Doctors told me that my spine is severely damaged. Where is he? Bhai, he is not aware of who brought him here. Do we drop him off at some far-off place? What have you done? Who is this? Inspector Rajendran! He looks very different. Looks like you've had a solid party! If you spare a cop he will target us for the rest of his life! Will it be heard outside? - No, Bhai. You carry on! Bhai, wait till I close the windows. "As per my statement" Don't you want me to come? Step out of the way. 'We will apply for the bail' 'Sir, don't leave him. ' 'You should never spare someone like him. How dare you?' 'What audacity!' 'Where is it?' 'Sir, he is responsible for it.' - 'He might confide, sir.' I know! - Sir, I heard a new Inspector is taking charge. I did ask Rajendran sir to take it easy. He could have gone places. But, he was a man of principles. Poor thing, he has gone missing! Please pray the new Inspector is not like Rajendran sir. I am sure all of you are praying hard! Like you have a choice! Hey! - I meant I've brought your ‘Tea,’ sir. Lord Ganesha, please save us. - 'Take that!' The new inspector should accept bribe and take good care of me. Sir, take a break. Have this tea and bash him later. Who should I give this to? - The new Inspector. What? Is he here already? I am the new Inspector. Give it to me. What is this, sir? You promised to give me an increment of Rs. 8,000 this year. But, you have offered only Rs. 200. Like I told you earlier, let's meet outside if you want to discuss your increment. You don't seem to have time for it. Why should we meet outside to discuss official matter? No! Only when we meet outside I can gauge your needs and decide on your increment. I can talk to GM accordingly! So, you tell me when you are free. We'll meet up. If that is the case, then why should I meet you, sir? I would rather meet GM and take your posting. If you get sacked from this job even your wife will refuse to meet you. I hope you understand. Don't be surprised, sir. Focus on your family! Did you actually say it? - Yes! So, you've lost your job? Yes! Since eight hours ago! Mom! This man has engaged in a brawl again! His clothes are torn! Don't let him in. Ask him to get out! Don't you hear her? Get out! Go! Get out! - Hey! You are too small to understand all this. Mom, this man in not listening to me. He's barging in. Hey, don't eat my ‘Dosa’! - He has been the same throughout! I cannot stand this torture anymore. Don't you have any shame? Leave. - Hey! - Get lost! - Stop it! Dad, come in. What happened? Sit down! Tell me what happened. - Gosh! Nothing new! He'll present the old wine in a new bottle. Mom, please stay calm. Tell me, Dad. What happened? Nothing, dear. I was just fighting for justice. Yeah right! He thinks he is Mahatma Gandhi to reinstate justice! He never stops to think about the three women at home. I am going to burn you with this! Go on, Mom! - Both of you please stop it. Dad, what is it? The ATM was very crowded today. A rascal tried to cut the line! I tried to stop him. But, he caught hold of my shirt. I got furious and almost punched his ear. But, I missed it by an inch. He punched me on my stomach before I could punch him. An unexpected blow. I slipped and fell down. Jeez! Don't waste your time listening to his crappy stories. Get back to work. - There's no hurry, Mom. She has lost her job. - What? Did you lose your job? "I think of you, when I am happy!" The joker is back in action! I wonder where he is going to get bashed today! Hey Anand! - Yes. I am definitely going to say it today. Since three months, I have been trying to give signals. But, she doesn't seem to catch it. Do you know why? She never looks at you to catch the signal. Correct! So, I am going to meet her face to face and seek her hand in marriage. Wonderful, Brother. - I know! "A lot of maidens are interested in me." Brother! - Yes? What, dude? Are you going to say 'All the best'? I suggest you stand three feet apart, when you confess your love to her. She might slap you. - Thanks, Buddy. He checks the mirror ten times a day. Yet, he does not realize. Don't leave the rotten tomatoes here. I get tempted to hit you with it. Idiot! Let me come back and deal with you! Get lost, you monster! What a waste of time! She walks with her head down always. Excuse me, I want to talk to you. Do you know the Sekar Stores that is beside your house? Yes! - I am Sekar, the proprietor! I am sure you will understand the problems of every boy at my age. Are you suffering from diabetes or BP? That's been taken care of. The moment I go home, my dad asks me to get married. My mom wants me to marry a cousin of mine. My grandma yearns to see great grandchildren! I come to shop to get away from all this. Here, I'm tortured by a swarming crowd of girls. But, my reply remains the same. I will not marry anyone else except the girl of my dreams. I have never told anyone who the lucky girl is. For the first time, I am going to disclose it to you. Didn't I tell you that she'll look at me? Hey, do you have eggs I am asking you. What are you looking at? Here, take the egg! Uncle, do you want to be an umpire? Happy Birthday! But, it's not my birthday today. I know. It is my birthday. Please wish me. Happy Birthday! And you are the girl of my dreams! - Sir! Please don't say this to anyone else, sir. My parents are weak-hearted. They are old. I don't want anything untoward to happen. What will happen? I am scared, sir. Am I destined to lead a disastrous life? Don't worry. I won't commit suicide. Suicide? To begin with, I can offer you Rs. 22,000 as salary. If you bring in more business as promised I'll give you an incentive after six months. If you agree to the terms, you can report to work on Monday. I agree, sir. I'll join from Monday. Bye, sir. Thank you! Dad! - Step out, dear. We shouldn't discuss personal stuff inside office premises. Tell me now! I've brought your lunch. Dear Kokila! Mom had called me. I heard you got a job. - Yes, Dad. I have got a job at a massage parlour. I have to report to work from Monday. No, dear. We'll soon have to get you married. Do you think taking a job at a massage parlor would be appropriate? Dad, I am not going to do the massage. There are therapists to do it. I am the Manager of the Spa. I understand, dear. But, the groom's side may insist on knowing the reason for you to take this job. This job pays me Rs. 8,000 more than my previous job. That's the reason and I am in dire need of that 8,000. Need I say more? Please get back to work. Fine! "Why did she come close to me?" "What made her go away from me?" "No matter what happens, even if I have to lose." Hey, why did you stop it? I've got a complaint from a customer. - About what? The betel leaf is torn! Do you want me to stitch it up? Do you think the customer will return, if you talk so irresponsibly? Let me take a look at our valuable customer. Do you think he'll stay alive till tomorrow? With this attitude of yours. Take this betel leaf, Grandpa. Hold it carefully. Anand! - What is it? Anand! - What do you want, dude? I've been meaning to tell you something for a long time now. I find it hard to hold back. Can I just spit it out? Hurry up! I have a lot of work to do. Anand, I showed a picture of Kokila to my grandma and told her that I was going to marry this girl. Do you know how my grandma reacted? Did she call you a heartless beast? Yes! How did you know? Any sane person would react like that. Hey! - Wait! Let me demonstrate it to you. What are you going to do? - Look at that girl! Wow! What a beauty! Now, when I turn to look at you Yuck! A beast! Hey! Did you get paid this month? You said you'll pay tomorrow, Brother. At this rate, you'll have to suck your thumb for next month. That's far better than working for you. - You rascal! Kokila! Don't jump. You hair might get stuck in the fan! Such a negative soul! Do your work! Thank you, sir. - Why did you pay him Rs.2000 for a bunch of tapioca? I paid him for the information and not for tapioca! Sir, what information can he possibly give? No Government employee gives proper information. So, I pay people like him to get the information. Sir, please give me Rs.1000. You give me information first. I'll pay Rs.1000 then. Give me some Tapioca at least, sir. - Enjoy! Is it this house? - Yes, Uncle. Do you think they'll be home? - Yes. 'God, if everything goes well, I'll offer what I promised.' Hey, what do you think you are doing? Come after me! Greetings! My name is Remo Kumar. I head Actor Sivakarthikeyan's fan club in Tiruvallur district. I am his uncle. Our boy's name is Lakshmana Kumar. It is LK, uncle! LK! LK! Hold it! - Sorry, Uncle! Sorry! Sorry! LK, Lakshmana Kumar all the same! Our boy is fond of your younger daughter! I am here to discuss it. She is going to school! How can you seek a student for marriage? She's in College, Uncle! College! College! College! He says she's in college. School, college all the same, sir. We have no intentions of interrupting her studies now! I'll take care of that, Uncle. I'll do anything to help her finish studies, Uncle. I'll make sure she comes out in flying colors, Uncle. I promise to make her a Doctor, a Collector or an Engineer, Uncle. Please tell them, Uncle. - Hold on, dear. The elders are discussing. Forgive me, Uncle. Sorry! Sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Pardon me, Uncle! Sorry! Sorry! My bad! I am sure he will take good care of her. - I will, Uncle. I will keep her happy. I'll lay a bed of roses for her to walk on. To keep her safe, I will pick thorn after thorn after thorn. Enough with the thorns! Even your parents refused to go with you. Only uncle has come to support you! - Indeed, Uncle. So, please show some respect. God! I've disrespected you, Uncle. Forgive me! Sorry! Sorry! What a fool I am! How can you disrespect your uncle? 'You have no brains!' - Can I ask you something? Yes! If you had a daughter - 'You fool! You fool!' will you get her married to a - 'How could you do this, you fool?' a guy like this? - 'Forgive me, Uncle! I am sorry!' 'I have disrespected my uncle! How dare I disrespect elders?' 'Mistake! Grave mistake! What an idiot!?' I won't, Madam. You don't have to agree too! Good! It's my mistake to have come with this marriage proposal! I'll take your leave. - Uncle! What do you want? - None of you seem to understand my love. One fine day, when this family is in trouble, only I'll come to help. That day, Shobi will realise my love for her. Shobi's sister Kokila, you will understand my love for her. Shobi's mother.. Aunt, may I know your name? You will realize it. - Get out of here! Hello, you'll have to collect mom's report from the hospital at 12. Don't forget. Take mom along! Take an auto! Don't go by bus. Understood? Okay, bye! Thank you! - Welcome! Ma'am, how did you like the massage? Whoa! The way she massages with the oil is simply amazing! That's good, Ma'am. Your body and mind will feel refreshed at all times. You seem to understand. Whereas, my husband feels I will land up in streets because of this. How much do I pay? Rs.1950 only! Take it! Ma'am, for best results come twice in a week. I wish the same, dear. But, it takes 50 minutes to reach here from home. I end up feeling extremely tired. Please inform if you have any special massage packages. Definitely, Ma'am. - But, mind you! I must feel relaxed after the massage. I don't want them to leave me hanging! It irritates me! Hello! Tell me, Shobi! Shobi! What happened? Lung cancer, madam. It is in second stage. It's quite a serious problem. You will have to take good care of her. There are a lot of advanced treatments now. So, it is definitely curable. But, the treatments are quite expensive. They could cost you around Rs.1.2-1.5 Millions. You have one month's time. Until then, we can treat her with tablets. But, we'll have to begin the treatment after a month. Otherwise, nothing is in our hands! Whether you stay awake or sleep I have only three months' time. My only wish is to see you both married and spend time with my grandchildren! Given the situation I don't think I'll live to see all that. Your dad is an innocent man! Please take good care of him. Have you decided that I won't be able to save you? You need Rs. 1.5 Million to save me. With that Rs. 1.5 Million I can host both yours and your respective children's weddings. I will turn the world around with that money! So, if you spend Rs.1.5 Million to save me I will probably die of guilt. Please don't do anything stupid. Henceforth, you must save every penny you earn for yourself. You are only worried because I am a girl. Right? Wait and watch! I'll definitely save you. What do you want? It would be great if you could help us sell this property in two days. I'll need three days to even locate this place. Oh! Then, I'll mortgage the property with you. You lend us money. How much do you expect? The property will fetch Rs. 2.5-3 Million, if I sell it. I see! - But, it isn't fair to expect so much in mortgage. So, Rs.1.5 Million would be ideal, sir. What have you got in that bag? Nothing, sir. I brought this bag to carry the cash bundles. Will I fit in it too? Sir! - What do you expect? This land won't fetch anything more than a Million and you demand Rs.10- Rs. 1.5 Million! We are in dire need of money, sir. Quite urgent. Look, dear. I am seated now. Do you know how difficult it is for me to get up? You won't understand my problems. Likewise, I won't understand yours. Hello! -'Hey Kittu!' 'Police have entered the premises.' 'Hide the package and run away.' 'It's fine if you are caught. But, safeguard the package.' Sure, Brother! I'll do as you say. Why are you staying here? Which College? For how long have you been staying here? But, we find it hard to believe. Hey, who is that? Don't go. Wait! Hey! Stop running. - Catch him! Don't let him go. - Catch him. Stop running! Sorry, sir! I am really sorry, sir. What did you do? Sir, let me go. - Why did you run away? Why did you try to escape? - Please let me go, sir. No problem! He is an accused. Is he hurt, sir? He'll be fine. Find an auto for them. Go! Come along, Madam. - Let's go, Sister. Get up! Up! Are you the one trading drugs here? - No, sir. Where have you hid the drugs? - I don't know, sir. Where is the package? Tell me. - Trust me, sir. I don't know. 'Form a line! Come on!' Yes, sir. - 'What happened?' We've caught the accused, sir. But, he has hidden the package. 'Lock up the lodge and conduct a thorough search!' 'Don't let anyone out.' - Yes, sir. I'll do a thorough checking. I will definitely return with the package. Okay, sir! Sister! It's fine if we get just Rs. 1 Lakh from it. Let's sell the property. We'll use the money to keep mom happy for next one or two months. Hey Tony, isn't it your sister's birthday tomorrow? What does she like? Why do you ask me? I'm not the one having an affair with her. You are her lover. So, find it yourself. Hey, drive faster. You have no sense of timing. 'What do you want?' How many times did I warn you to stay calm? We can just stay quiet, Bhai. That Guru is forever targeting us. We've been caught five times so far. 'We have a loss of Rs.10.5 Million.' If he gets hold of the package this time.. ..you will be liable for that Rs. 2.5 Million! Don't worry, Bhai! I'll handle it. It's my responsibility. Sister, please step down. You don't have to panic. Think of me as your brother! Get down! Come! Get going! - Do you want to get dropped here, Madam? Go on, dude! Didn't you just get someone arrested? Sir, we didn't get him arrested. I just opened the door and he banged against it. Maybe! According to us, you got him caught! But, that's fine. We'll handle it. Our package is stuck in the lodge. You'll have to bring it for us. Sir, why should we bring it for you? Since you got our staff arrested it is your duty now Further you are the only one who can exit the lodge without Police search. No, sir. We will not do it. I am not giving you a choice, dear. You hand over the package and take your sister back. Tony, take the sister away and buy her ice-cream! Darling, follow him! Tony, get going! - Little one, follow Tony! Babu! Hide the gun! Please leave, sir. - Come! Do you want a cup or a cone ice-cream? Murthy, find an auto. I can't let you in now. - I forgot a document here, sir. Let me just go take it. - No! This place is under search. I cannot let anyone in! Please wait. - Sir, I I will come immediately. - No way! Please go! Hey Murugan! - Sir, please! What is the issue? - She says she left a document here, sir. She wants to take it. - Send her in. 'Open the other bag!' What do you have in here? What's in the bag? Lift up your hands! What do you have in your back pocket? And the front? Check their bags! Check it! - What's inside that cover? Hey, come here. Hey girl, I'm calling you. Come here. Bring that girl here. Open the bag! Hey, come forward. Sir is calling you! Come.. Go.. You are the one who came to take the document, right? Why are you standing in the queue? Leave! Sir! - Come! I'll turn around! You take the package. Why should you turn, sir? I am sure you have hidden the package under your dress. No, sir. I hid it in my lunch box. Lunch box? Let me see! Whoa! They search men till the last garment. But, they are quite lenient with women. Go! - Sir! Can I have my box? Do you want it back? Dude, do we have any bag here? What I am about to tell you is very important! Please listen to it carefully! As soon as you step out of the car, you go your way and I'll go mine. You've never heard of me! Do you follow? Go! What do you want? - Give me 700 bucks! For what occasion? - You asked me to have ice-cream! Ice-cream! How many ice-creams, sir? - 33! 33! How many did the girl have? She refused to have any ice-cream. It's quite expensive, right? Should I shoot him down? Give me the gun! Go pay him! - I've lost my purse. You get lost too! - Start the car! Babu! As if we didn't have enough troubles, there is one more to handle. It's fine. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. How so? What is this? - This belongs to the man who stood guarding me! Why did you take his purse? - There was a lot of money in it. I felt like taking it, so I did. That's wrong! - Given our situation, nothing is wrong. Stealing from a rogue like him is definitely not wrong. Give it to me! Is he eying Kokila's house? Let me join the party! Hey, who are you? You got biscuits for a penny and have been eying that house for hours! I'm LK, Brother. - LK? Does it stand for Lord Kumar? - Lakshmana Kumar, Brother. So? I trust you like an elder brother and would like to confess something I'm in love with a girl in that house. Anand! - What do you want, dude? Look at this joker! I've spent Rs.1 Million in setting up a shop near her house! Whereas you invest Rs.10 on biscuits and dare to ogle at my girl. What are you doing? - I'm a college student, Brother. It's been four years since Kokila completed college. But, her sister is still in college. Really? - Yes! So, are you in love with her sister? - Yes, Brother. Is it? Do you know who my lover is? - Yes, Brother. Who is it? - You are in love with the elder one! How did you guess? - The elder one is a perfect match for your personality! Yuck! - Come in, Brother. Pull a chair for him. Come in, Co-Brother! Let's bond. Here, sign this document. What is this? - Cylinder Name Transfer form. What is the need for this now? It will be easier, if we do this, while I am alive. They'll make you run from pillar to post! Sign this! I have a better idea. I'll dig up a six-foot pit and bury you. You can leave in peace. Stop taunting me like this. Sign this and leave it on the table. How old is your mother, dear? Sixty two, Ma'am. Look there! That kid is only three years old. He is suffering the same ailment as your mother! There are about 25 kids like him and each one of them is in critical stage. We don't have enough funds for their treatment. Only after we help these children we can think of helping someone at your mother's age. Hey! Excuse me. Just a minute. NGOs cannot help people in need at all times. They are bound by rules and regulations. There are a lot of genuine philanthropists out there. I felt really sorry, when I heard you talk about your mother. Mother means everything to us! If you are really looking for help please visit this address tomorrow. But, call before you come. Do you follow, dear? - Yes, sir. Thanks a lot! Did you take a good look, sir? Are you happy, sir? Can we finalize the deal? Yes! Go ahead! Tell me, when you need it. Sir is a true gentleman. He is ever ready to help people in trouble. Just like you he has certain needs too. He expects you to fulfill them. Yes, sir. What should I do? Sir owns a beach house. You must visit the same, whenever he calls for you. This is not a compulsion. Please don't think we are forcing you. Accept only if you are comfortable with it. I can promise one thing though. We'll make sure your identity remains confidential. We are people with high influence. If you agree come to this address on Saturday. Please give it a good thought, dear. You got to save your mother. It is definitely curable. But, the treatment is quite expensive. It can cost around Rs.12- Rs. 1.5 Million. What are you doing? - Can't you see? Are you practicing for later, when I am gone for good? As long as I am alive, I will do the cooking. Go mind your business! Fine! Do it yourself. Just don't talk like this. Let's say I agree to give you Rs.1 Million. But, what if you fail to repay it? We'll be the losers then. We can remain relatives as long as we stick to basic greetings and courtesies. Why do you need Rs.1 Million, dear? Also, it's only ten days since you joined work. The best I can do is to increase your monthly salary by Rs. 2,000! Kokila! There is not a single good picture of four of us together. Can we please click a picture together? There is no hurry though. You carry on! Sir, hold on! Please smile! Not just one, you equal the strength of ten men! Can't you see it? Don't you feel it? Look properly! Go farther beyond! You will see it. You'll see the light! The light at the end of the tunnel! Go for it, Girl! Babu, that girl is here. Which girl? The girl who delivered drug from the mansion. Oh! What does she want? She wants her commission for bringing the drug. Commission? Don't worry. Document clear. I have done a background check already. Her dad works as a watchman at the ATM. Her mom is a patient and her sister goes to College. No problem. If there's any trouble, we'll have full control over her. In fact, even now she will leave if you refuse to give her the commission. Tony, something is wrong. We'll have to find out how the girl managed to reach us here. Call the boys! We don't need the boys for it. I'll explain it to you! How? Didn't I tell you that I misplaced my purse? She brought it back. I have four visiting cards in my wallet. She is a very good girl and has left the money intact. Hand over this money to that girl and send her away. Fine! She says 1% of 2.5 Million is Rs.25,000. But, you have given her only Rs. 5,000. Who told her the drug was worth Rs. 2.5 Million? I did! - Babu! Let me remind you of your affair with my sister. Be careful! Go! Go, bring her! Here's the Rs. 25,000 you asked. That day, you rushed to save your sister. I am paying you this as token of appreciation for your family values! Hey, you said something. What was it? Document clear! Her dad is an ATM watchman, mom a patient and her sister is in College. No problem. If there's any trouble, we'll have full control over her. We are waiting for your order! Did you hear that? They have your complete history now. They are rogues of the first order! Don't interact with them! You shouldn't be coming to a place like this. Leave! Iyer, last month.. - Sir! If you have any job, I'll take it up. Babu, like I told you earlier, her dad is an ATM watchman her mom a patient and her sister goes to College. Stop doubting me! Else, you'll have to face a different Tony! Sir, don't worry. I'll do as you say and deliver the package wherever you ask me to. Hey Tony, this girl thinks we are engaged in a wrong trade. What do you think was in the package that you brought earlier? It's imported 'Rangoli' powder. You cannot use it here though! If you did, cops will arrest you! Are you nuts, Babu? You threatened her with a gun that day and now you call it 'Rangoli' powder. Nor do we look like people who are engaged in 'Rangoli' powder trade. That girl is aware of everything including your green color underpants. True, sir! No, sir. I mean, like he mentioned. Her dad is an ATM watchman, mom a patient and her sister is in college. If there's any trouble, we'll have full control over her. It's up to you now! No matter how much we groom our boys that Inspector nabs them with their bad odor! With this girl, we'll be able to get away from the inspector. She looks like an angel indeed! Trust me! She looks very docile and innocent. If she delivers successfully, we'll be the next Pablo Escobar! Ask her to come! Hey Babu! Is this truly a business setup or are you trying for a setup with her? - No, Mohan! I cannot divorce my wife! Pablo is my only aim! I see her as a fellow professional. But, I do feel excited even when I look at her as a fellow Professional. Even that nosy Inspector Guru will not suspect her! Bring a chair! Hey, get up! Fatso! Sit down! Hey, all of you step out! Jeez! They won't let us sit in peace. They don't let me play Candy Crush for more than two minutes! I better have 'Pongal' and go to sleep! I don't trust anyone easily! Despite realizing the risk in the job you have agreed to take it up. Give me one good reason for it. Only then I will accept. I believe one can work efficiently only if they have good reason for it. The cops don't attack you directly. They'll do it when you least expect it. Two months ago an Inspector tried to nab me. But, I killed him! That's a different story though! Self-defense is very important. So, why do you want to do this? Give me one good reason. Mom.. What? Like I explained her mother is suffering from stage -II cancer. I need money for her treatment. Fine! Come and collect the package tomorrow. Hello! - 'Today a new recruit will be bringing the package.' 'Collect it!' - What? A new recruit! We are no lovers to keep changing partners. Safety is our priority! Instead of acting in haste you can ask Nirmal to deliver late! Who is Nirmal? 'Just an example, Buddy!' Kumar will turn when you call him a monkey! But, a monkey won't turn, if you call him Kumar! Neither will it turn, when you call it a monkey! You may beat me at wordplay! But, you can't feed off it! My neck is paining! Bye! Loser! Give me a slice of watermelon! - Sure, sir We are going to discuss business. Please leave! Look who his business alliances are! Fruit vendor, buttermilk vendor, petty shop guy! How are things here? Nothing much, sir. This area is very clean now. There have been no dealings after you took charge, sir. My foot! I don't like it. Here, keep this! Thanks, sir. I'll come later. Come in! Sit down, please. What kind of plant are you looking for? Herbal or Vaasthu plant? No, sir. Mohan sir sent me here. Mohan! I don't know anyone apart from 'Mike' Mohan. Oh! So, you are the new recruit. Yes! Give it under the table. Why have you brought it in a lunch box? New technique, is it? Modern methods! What a wonderful idea. Take it, dear. - Sir! Give it under the table. - Oh! Thank you, sir! She looks very innocent. On the other hand, she engages in drug trading! Dear Mohan! You've hit a jackpot by recruiting this girl. She is innocence personified. 'Please find someone like this for me too!' I am tired managing these beasts here. It's time to work with the beauty and rule the world! Buddy, hear out my punch line before you cut the call. Despite having eight legs a spider will take years to alight a flight of stairs. But, a rocket worth Rs. 10 will zoom in the sky the moment you light it. I wish your growth is similar to that of Rs.10 rocket. Bye! Come here. Give me Rs.5,000. I'll return it immediately. Quite urgent. I don't have money. - Stop lying. Call him! If you ever trouble her again I will kill you! Come in. I have a gut feeling that they are still trading drugs! What do you think? - Not a chance, sir. Hundred percent! The City is clean ever since you took charge. Get lost! Go from there. I forgot to tell you. Please inform immediately, if she vomits blood. If so, we'll have to begin the treatment within a week! Sir, there are a lot of new guys visiting the buildings on my left. Kindly check, sir! Hey girl, stop. Get inside the jeep. Sir, why should I? Get inside the jeep! Sir, what happened? I. It won't look nice, if I got down. So, you get inside the jeep on your own. Darling! It's me, dear! He is my husband. He was just teasing you. Honey, I think you scared her. Don't you have any sense? Look what you have done! I was just playing with you. Don't cry for all this. - Poor thing! Tell us where you have to go, we'll drop you there. - Senseless man! Get in! Come on! Please don't mistake us, dear. Come in! We'll drop you! Come in, dear! Hey! Start the car. What are you doing here? Do you live in this area? I just completed a therapy session for a client here. Are you doing on your own too? We offer home services for far off clients. Do you massage too? There she goes again! I have completed the course. For a long time now, I have a severe neck pain! I am unable to sit or stand. I find it difficult to manage. What do you suggest? It's paining badly. Oh! I'll do it. Sir, I'll get down. I can take a bus from here. Is your house here? Are you sure you want to get down here? Yes, sir. - Couldn't he wait till I got my massage? Okay! Hey, stop the car. - Sir! Okay, sir! Take care, dear! Bye! What is the matter? You wanted to meet me urgently. Brother, I plan to offer a small prayer at my family deity's temple for our love to be successful. We'll have to cut four times on each hand and offer the dripping blood to the deity! - Hey! In case of bleeding you must meet a doctor and not a deity! Don't make fun, Bro! Next, you'll have to cut four times on your thigh and again offer the dripping blood to deity and call out Shobi's name. Then.. - You'll die! By God's grace, she will be my wife next year, Bro! Buddy, Doctor says the alcohol content is high in my body. So, I cannot donate blood to anyone. Now, if I offer it to God, it will be a huge mistake. So, I'll call you, once I am doing fine. Not a problem, Brother. We can draw the blood from your tummy. Yeah right! We'll do it later. I'll call you once I am okay, we'll do as you say. Get going, dude! If you want I can come. - Not at all! Come only after I call you. I'll wait for your call. - Get lost, you needle face! He expects me to puncture myself for love! Hey Anand! If he comes again, tell him I am not there. Yeah okay! If he asks, I'll tell him you died! What did you say? - Fine! I'll tell him you are cremated. He wants the shop for himself! Hello! Am I talking to the Inspector? Who are you? I called to help you! Do I have to reveal my identity? Fine! Tell me, sir. - I did tell my friends that it's very difficult to trade drugs since Inspector Guru took charge. I told them he was wiped the city clean. But, they laughed! - Why so? I heard a girl engaged in the trade and walks past you everyday and you don't do anything about it. How is she taking it? In 557F bus! Do you know the timing of the bus? 8:30! Where does she board the bus? Why, I'll hold a seat for you next to the girl. You can catch her then! If the information happens to be wrong. Quick! Go brush and leave. It's already 7:15. You need to be there by 8:30. Stop sleeping like a buffalo! Useless fellow! 'There's going to be a checking here. Ask everyone to leave. ' Don't stop! Keep going. Go! Go! Go! Come aside! - Stop the bus! Go park there! - This way! Enough! Stop here. Constable, make sure no one leaves the bus. - Okay, sir. There's a checking. Please take your bags out! Keep your bags open. - What is in this box? Lunch! - Open the bag! Show it! - What's in it? 'Open it!' - 'What's in this?' 'Open this zip.' Show me your bag! What have you got in this? Take it out! What's inside this? - Nothing, sir. 'Open the bag!' 'Open it!' Are you waiting for special instructions? Open the bag! Open the water bottle. - Open this zip. Show it! Hurry up! - Open the bag! What's inside this? Sir, have you checked here? 'Yes, madam. It's done.' 'What about that lady?' - 'Done, madam'. This girl? Yes, madam. - Open the bag! Open it! I am well acquainted with sir! We are good friends. That's fine. - Open the bag! Come on, open it. What's inside the lunch box? Take it out! Take it out! - 'Sir, this side is clear!' Open the box! Open it! It's just curd rice. Why did you hesitate to open it? 'Hey Mohan, fortunately I was doing the checking.' 'But, if Guru had seen it you'd be dead by now.' 'While I am working here for you' I guess someone in your team is helping Guru! Our boys are not that kind! They are loyal and faithful. 'It's time to test their loyalty!' 'First, find who the black sheep is and finish him.' 'Else, I will be forced to finish you someday.' 'So, please take care.' Look, Kokila. Don't cry. It's not your problem alone! It's a trouble for all of us! No, sir. I think I am their only target. They did this to get me caught! If they planned to get you caught they would have given details about you. I am feeling scared, sir. You won't be scared, after you see my action now. You'll be able to work without any tension. Hey Shani! I have a small doubt. What if you gave them the tip? Get out! If you come forward and admit the mistake I'll spare you. This is not a big deal! I'll think you did it out of frustration! At the end of the day, we are all one family! Sir, take their phones and check caller history! If no one has stepped out since morning I am sure they must have called him. Shani! - Brother! Whose phone is this? It's mine, Brother. Why do you ask? Why did you delete the caller history? Brother, I am innocent. I didn't do it. I don't know how it got deleted. Brother, please. Trust me, Brother. I didn't tip the inspector. I won't do such cheap stuff, Brother. Please think about it. Don't make a mistake, Brother. I don't know, Brother. Forgive me! Please! I swear I didn't do it. Brother! - Sir! Ask him if someone else took his phone this morning, sir! Two people borrowed my phone, Brother. Give me a good reason which proves that he was the one who tipped the Police about this girl. Likewise, you should give me a reason that this guy did so! When I am convinced with one of your reasons I'll kill the other! Instead, if you tried to beat around the bush I'll kill both of you! Lord Muruga! Brother, you haven't assigned us a task since she got here. He must have done it out of that frustration. Since there is no work, we don't have enough funds on hand. He might have done it out of that grudge. Brother, a lot of problems arise when there is a girl in the team. Maybe that's why he did it. He might have thought the girl won't fit the job and will land us all in trouble someday. Maybe he did out of fear! Brother, that girl looks hideous. I think he did it out of hatred! I think she rejected his proposal and he is trying to seek revenge. Brother, you have an eye on that girl, ever since she came here. One fine day, when she realizes your weakness, she'll kill you. Then, she'll be the next drug Lord. Probably he dislikes working for her and did this to avoid it. Enough! Everything you said made sense. But, you made a mistake with pointing fingers. You are the one, right? This is nothing unusual. It's quite common here. You must learn to adapt to it. You shouldn't keep thinking about it. Focus your attention on delivering the packages. Men may come, men may go! Only honestly and loyalty will help you survive here. Do you follow? Go! Don't be scared! Get going! Hey Shani! Clear the body! Wipe this place clean and dunk him in acid. Sir! I have my own doubts, sir. Maybe, like he mentioned what if this guy had done it? Shoot him down too! Only then I'll leave! My judgment never goes wrong. It's always right! I'm sure he must have done it. No, sir. We haven't seen it with our eyes. You can't be sure of your guess! No problem, sir. I'll wait here. You take rest and then shoot him down. Okay? Oh! Don't believe her, Brother. She is misleading you. Brother, she can't be trusted. Please don't trust her, Brother. I didn't do it, Brother. I am truly innocent, Brother. I didn't do it. Please trust me, Brother. - I know you didn't do it, Buddy. But, it's very difficult to find a girl like her in our field. No, sir. I'll leave only after you shoot him down. Sir! Brother, I didn't do it. I'm innocent. Brother! Brother! - Pardon me, dear. Brother, I swear I didn't do it. Sir! You don't want me to do it? No, sir. I am feeling scared to see it. - Brother! You shoot him down, after I walk away from here. I prefer hearing the gunshot over seeing this. Oh! Give the bag to me. - No need, Mom. I'll take it. Give it to me! What tablet is this? - That makes me nauseous. Don't fret about it. Just one more month! Why? Won't I pull beyond that? If you keep talking like this, I am going to strangle you to death. Fine! Who is he? How dare you get my boys killed to save your mother? What? - Sir! Sir! Mom has no connections with it. Who gave you this courage? - Kokila! Sir! Sir, please spare my mother. You are doing all this to save her life! Why do you refuse work all of a sudden? I don't think I can do this anymore, sir. I feel scared. I'll definitely get caught. Pay me for whatever I have done until now. I'll leave, sir. Give me 'Appalam'! Sorry, Brother! Since you have hurt your neck I thought I can help you with this. Fine! Meet me at 6 PM tomorrow. I'll arrange for the money! I'll make necessary arrangements, Brother. 'Save me!' There are only two ways to exit from this field. Either you get caught by Police or get killed by us. Sir! But, neither of the two will happen to you. I am there to help you plan a clean exit from this. Do you follow? Thanks a lot, sir. Though, I am tough and stern with others when it comes to you, I wish to be gentle and nice. There's a brown bag inside the cupboard in that room. I have left your money there. Take it and go! If you stay calm for the next one hour rest of your life will be peaceful! Right since the very first day, I have feelings for you. But, I am sharing it only now. I don't have the stamina to rape you! My spinal cord is completely damaged! So, please cooperate with me. Switch on the AC with that remote and lie down! Auto. 'The number your calling is either switched off or not reachable.' Madam, here is the change. Mom, leave everything and just come with me. There's a small problem. I'll explain on the way. Hurry up! You heard your sister! Leave immediately! Take an auto to the bus stand and enjoy a vacation at ‘Ooty’! And we'll go celebrate your escape with 'Kulfi' party! What did you do to Mohan? He has become like a lifeless doll! Sir, I didn't do anything. I just pushed him off. He fell against the cupboard His neck was already broken! Yet, you twisted it! Don't act innocent here. - Babu! Don't spare her! - Get lost! Are you even aware of Mohan's power and influence? If something happens to him, a bomb will be launched from Bombay! Hey! - And here it is! Yes, Bhai. I am with her. You can talk to her. Here! Speak up! Hello! - Hi, Kokila. How are you? Sir.. Sir.. Boys told me that Mohan has become like a wooden puppet now. 'But, I don't miss Mohan!' 'When will I miss him? Only when my work gets stalled.' 'Only when I miss Mohan' 'I would want to harm the person, who attacked Mohan.' Sir, I didn't do anything on purpose. 'We can discuss that later.' 'How are you going to ensure that I don't miss Mohan?' I agree to do whatever Mohan was doing for you, sir! But, will you let me go after I complete the task? 'First, we'll have to clear the stock with Mohan!' 'We can discuss about you later!' Sir! Sir, how many Kilos do I have to clear? 'Hundred Kilos!' Sir? How do I manage 100 Kilos, sir? 'Mohan was handling it. But, you broke his neck.' Okay, sir. I'll do it. I have told her a number of times that she does not have to save me. I am sure she was trying to do it and landed in trouble. We'll have to help her come out of the mess. We should do it, before I die. I am sure you are wondering how to open the matter to us. But, I am very confident that you have done something wrong. I also know you are doing it for us. Nope! I know you are doing it for me. What is this, dear? It is not just your problem anymore. We are a family! Look! I don't care about what you have done so far. Henceforth, we'll be together in anything we do. Sorry, Dad! I am not going to ask you anything. If I did, you would reply saying you did this to save your mother. If I asked, will you do anything to save your mother you are going to say, I should have done it. Three of you very well know, I am unfit for it. So, you do as you please. I'll do as you say! Madam, is this house No.4? Yes it is. What do you want? I have brought a new cupboard. Where do I unload it? We didn't order for any cupboard. Check in the neighborhood. Brother, I ordered for it. Unload it here! Fine! Bring it here, Boys! - Give a hand! Lift it up! Hold the bottom. Go forward! Careful! Have been waiting for the delivery of this cupboard? Do you think we are in the position to buy a new cupboard now? The house is a wreck! Yet, you guys are celebrating! Hey! What? Did you forget what happened last night after seeing the new cupboard? Don't you feel ashamed? Shut up and turn around! What is this, dear? This is the package we have to deliver, Dad. 'Praise Lord Muruga!' 'Praise Lord Muruga!' Lord Muruga, give us the strength to deliver the package safely! Please grace us with your blessings. By God's grace, nothing will happen to us, dear. We are doing smuggling for a good reason. God will be with us. We can walk with our heads held high! Lord Muruga please hide us from cops with your spear! Mom! Do you guys remember my instructions to you? Don't let your face show that you are smuggling drugs. We must look very innocent to others. Please don't be scared. Most importantly, stay calm at all times. Darling, I'm looking for my daughter Kokila. Where is she? Dad, we don't have a choice. Don't bother answering him, dear! Attend the call! Hello! - 'Kokila!' Tell me, sir! 'I have sent a white van, like you had asked.' 'No.3658! Driver will leave. You'll have to drive on your own.' Done, sir! - 'Begin your drama and call out' 'van will arrive at your spot.' - Okay, sir! We'll leave in five minutes. - Hurry up! Mom, everything is in your hands now. Are you sure you can do it? Do you want to try once? It's perfect, Mom! I am just going to drive. Should I perform too? God knows how we'll have the strength to pull through! Mom, are you ready? Shall we leave? Yes! Yes! Brother! Help! - Please help! Can someone come? Kokila shouting! - Help! Help! Mom is unwell. We have to take her to the hospital. - Start the van! She is calling! Start the van! - Please help! Come fast! - My mom is unwell! Please help us, Brother. Who dashed against my van? Wait till I get out! Gosh, it's a new van! Who asked you to come here? - I am here to help! Do you run an ambulance service or what? Look at you! You look like an ‘Orangutan!’ You also look like a Chimpanzee! How dare you speak the truth? - Hey! Hey Little Anjali, I'll slap you and send you back to school! How dare you! Start the car! - Sit down! I'll slap you! - Murthy! Start the van! Get out of here! Go! Go! Get lost! Go back! Get going! Who are you to help this family? Hey Kokila, go bring your mother. No! I'll take that White van! Which is more important? White van or your mom's health? No, it's fine! You were calling out for help a few seconds ago! Don't waste your time choosing the vehicle! Look! White van is no good! Green is a good omen! Come, let's go. Listen to me! What are you still looking at? - You fat head! Haven't you left yet? - Sir! Sir! We'll go with you! I'll break your head. - We'll go in the green van, sir! Now, you realize! Go bring my future mother-in-law. - Sister! Come with me! - Go get ready! How do we manage? - Stop laughing. Come here! Give me a hand, you jokers! How will they carry if you lie down like this? Dad, come here. - How should I lay down! Head this side! - Lie down! Hurry up! Lie down! Make it fast! Come on, Boys! Mother-in-law! Look likes she just lay down! Don't worry, Mother-in-law! Hey, hold her legs. - No! Carry her with the table. Why do we need the table? Doctor asked me to bring her with the table. Who is this Doctor who has no table? Mom needs help! - Oh yes! Hold on! Lift her up like you lift a sack! Sure done! Careful, guys! - One, two, three. Dude, she is really heavy! - It's all bone weight! Don't worry, Mother-in-law! Don't worry! Don't shake! Hurry up! Come fast! Come here! Brother. - Careful, Buddy! Push this side! Done! - Give me a hand! Hey, both of you go peel coconuts! 'Hey, make sure they do it properly.' Get in! - Sir! Let my dad drive the van! Can you? Please let dad drive! Oh, you want me to stay with you! Uncle, go hit the accelerator! Get in, Kokila! Get in! We are not going on a picnic. Make it fast! Sister, hold the bag! - Mother-in-law, move your feet a bit! Uncle, start the van! 'Kokila, if you call out for help' 'I shall greet thee with a bow! - Is the spelling right, Kokila? Sister, nothing will happen to you. Don't worry! Don't be worried about your daughters! Think of me as your own brother. I Sekar, the proprietor of Sekar stores promise to save you! Poet Thiruvalluvar has quoted 'that no evil will come to people' 'who are kind and helpful.' Your family has done no wrong and therefore no harm will come to you. Don't worry, Aunt! Babu, kill the girl and her family as soon as she delivers the package. We'll be at risk, if they are alive! Sure, Bhai! Kokila! Police! Mom, police is here. Oh God! Hey Kokila, what are you doing? Why do you have to tell her all this? She is already sick! I'll deal with the Police! Stop the van! Come aside! 'Open the door!' Oh, it's this guy! Dude, she is fighting for life. Don't try to be a hero now, Ragothaman. We have received order to check all vehicles. What are you checking? Did they ask you check this innocent family? Sir, all you need is money, right? Do you want 10's or 100's? Do I look like a Policemen or postman to you? Ragothaman! - Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir, my mother is unwell. We have to rush her to the hospital. Please, sir! Someday, I'll get to book a case! - Focus on arresting Pedophiles. Shut it gently, Ragothaman. This is not your dad Purushothaman's van. Uncle, run the van over him. We'll pay Rs.1,500 as fine and be done. Only people with heavy pockets have to fear them. Not us! I would have put him in his place. But, sister's health is priority! Uncle, no matter who, don't stop the van anymore! Just run the van over them! I'll handle the case. Sekar! If Police stop us next time, please be polite with them. Why should we talk Politics? If anyone tries to stop the van anymore only my hand will do the talking! Nah! We are carrying certain stuff! That's why! Stuff? Are you carrying a liquor bottle? Something more than that. - Huh? Oh, is it beer then? - Hey! Have you never got sloshed before? - Who? Me? I am king of getting sloshed! Close your ears and turn around. You are too young to hear all this! - Yeah right! Are you carrying Scotch? Mom, please get up! - Don't disturb the patient. Don't wake her up. - Nah! Let me sit for some time. My back is aching from lying down! - Suddenly, she seems to be normal. Ouch! What is this? Are these 'Rangoli' powder, Kokila? It is Cocaine, you fool! Cocoa? Is it the powder that is used to make chocolates? - My Foot! Hey! - Haven't you seen foreigners drag it? We are smuggling the top-most drug in the world. It is worth Rs. 3 Billion. It's been transported from Columbia to Africa from Africa to Afghanistan, from Afghanistan to Bombay. From Bombay it was brought to Gummudipundi and now we are taking it to Redhills! If we get caught, we'll have to serve 10 years in Jail. While we are carrying out such a crucial task you are wasting our time cracking stupid jokes. Did you just call me stupid? Yes, Sekar. We are smuggling drugs. Is it similar to weed? Not really! Let me explain! Yeah, if one gram of weed is worth Rs.5 this will cost you Rs. 5,000. This one? If one is caught with weed, he has to serve 7 years in jail! 7 plus the amount here.. I guess I'll serve lifetime imprisonment. I am going to die in jail. Police, dear! I guess this is why her dad wanted to drive! What a commitment in acting! I hope it is not Ragothaman! Sir, looks like an emergency! Let them go! Fine! You are doing a family business here. I understand you don't want any interruptions and want me to leave. That's all right! I will leave. Uncle, please stop the van. Let me get down. They'll shoot you the moment you set foot on the ground. What? - Do you see a white van behind? They are following us. Hey, I saw this van near your house. We were supposed to come in that van. But, you've made us travel in this delivery van. Hey, stop throwing chilies. What if it got stuck in my nose? You brainless monkey! Dear I suggest you travel with us. Yeah right! You are going on a family vacation to Shimla for me to join. Keep quiet, woman! Thanks to you, I got into a fight with Ragothaman. You are engaged in smuggling and you expect me to join you. Why is he opening the counter now? Police! Nah! Come lie down. Then you can start acting. Come! Come! - Jeez, I can't even rest. Start acting as a family! My wife is unwell. I am taking her to the hospital. Fine, leave. It is certain that I can't escape now. So, let's pick up one more guy. You are traveling as a family! I feel real lonely. If we pick up another guy, he'll give company to me. Who is it, sir? Aunt! Aunt! Aunt, nothing will happen to you. You'll be fine. You have given birth to an angel, a darling, Aunt. If something happens to you, I'll break the world and tear the sky. Don't tear my saree, dear. Sit down. - Sure, Aunt. Bro, I was waiting for a chance to prove my love. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. Here, take a kiss! You idiot! Move aside. - Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro! Bro, I will never forget this favor. Hey, if we get caught, this will be the last memory you'll ever have. Keep quiet for some time. He kissed me without brushing! - Am I irritating you, Bro? A little too much, Dude. - Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro. We have to save Shobi's mother! Shobi's mom.. Save.. - It is saving Shobi's mom, Bro! What is this, dude? - Bro, let's converse on Whatsapp till Shobi's mom recovers from this. Dude, I am sitting right next to you. We can just talk it out. Does not matter. Discussing on phone is the new trend. Please, Bro! You crazy cyber guy! You are going to be doomed. - Shobi! Shobi! Shobi! Lord Sai Baba! Bro, why are looking at me? Send it to 30 people immediately. Only then, we can save Shobi's mom! Hey, there are just 20 people on my contact list. Where do I find the other ten? - Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro. I have to save Shobi's mom! Save Shobi's mom! Save Shobi's mom! Save Shobi's mom! God please! God! Sorry, dear! I called him here to irritate you! But, he is torturing me now! Shut up! Shut up? Did you see that? You will have to stay shut for the rest of your life. Do you want to leave or stay with us? We have to save Shobi's mom, Bro. Please, Bro! Mom! Mom! Mom! - He wants to save your mom! We'll have to save Shobi's mom, Bro. Sorry! Sorry, Bro! God, please save Shobi's mom! Hey Shobi, hold mom! Mom, careful. - Lord Muruga, save me. Sorry! I didn't spot the speed-breaker! You blind owl! Even if we manage to escape from Police, I don't think he'll spare us. He is definitely going to dash the vehicle somewhere! Lord Muruga, save us! Ouch! Bro! - I'll start swearing now! Who is this Black Panther? They all look like amateurs. Did you transport 100 kilos of drug with their help? Jeez! I have a few staff here as big as wild elephant and wild buffaloes. But, they are unfit to do anything. Show me the God! Wow! Wonderful! God, thanks for giving me a glimpse of such shrewd staff. Brother! Come close! - What is it, dude? You are one of a kind! No one will ever doubt you! You've got such a face-cut! You look like an unclean toilet! So do you! You look like the old shattered bucket in the bathroom! You are truly innocent to tease this Alphonse who has committed over 30 murders. This innocence will take you too great heights. Let me explain it! When an illiterate draws high salary the literates go green with jealousy! Likewise, when I see you all, I feel extremely jealous. Hey buffaloes, bring the package down. - Okay, sir. Mom, I hope your work is done. A big salute to your family! Please return the vehicle to me and get going your way! Please! Uncle! Stop the van! They've to get down. Only 10% of the work is done, dear. - What? We have to complete the remaining 90%. 90% pending? Please shower before you come tomorrow. What? Should I shower again? Yes, Bro. Let's get an extra pair of clothes too! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Bro! - Hey, Bhai! I am paying Rs.2.5 Billion. Why have you sent packs of salt to me? You asked for it. - I asked for cocaine salt. Whereas, you have sent me Tata salt. We can only make salt candy out of it. Alphonse, stop playing the fool with me. By raising your voice, you can't turn salt into Cocaine. So, stop it. I asked you for 100 kilos of cocaine salt. You send me 10 Kilos of Cocaine and 90 Kilos of table salt. It is 100 Kilos of pure Cocaine. - Just because a tortoise is patient you cannot test its patience. Likewise don't test this Alphonse's patience. It is dangerous, Bhai! How can I be sure that you haven't interchanged it? Alphonse is good at twisting words and not changing stuff! 'Let me explain it to you.' I can't take a lion to Comedy Club to make it laugh. Likewise, I cannot take you to lion, to control your laughter. If the package has not reached you, like you told me I will make sure it gets delivered by tomorrow afternoon. If the package does not get delivered tomorrow, you are not a Bhai. You are a girl! Tell me, Bhai! - Babu, package missing! Hey, wait! What are you saying, Bhai? If I come to know, you are responsible for it I'll kill everyone in your family, until the last soul! Bhai, I didn't do it. I don't trust anyone with this as the worth of the package is very high. Did you try calling Kokila? - She is disconnecting my call. What are you saying, Bhai? - In the next one hour you have to report the whereabouts of her and the package. If you fail 'I will kill you!' Hey, where the hell are you? How dare you try to fool us? Where is the package? Sir, I will talk only if you stay calm. Otherwise, I'll cut the call. Hey, are you threatening me? Where is it? Tell me! Sir, I was the one who interchanged the stock with salt and delivered it to Alphonse. I have the balance 90 Kilos with me. I am about to ask you a small favor! Are you trying to get me entrapped in this? Please hear me out and then talk! Go on! I know Bhai won't spare us, even after we finish this task. Either he is going to make us do this again and again or he might just kill us! 'If we continue to do this' 'we'll definitely be caught by Police soon.' 'We've just got a small chance to escape from this.' 'Only you can help us with this.' I'll deliver the 90 kilos of stock to you. You can trade it and make money. As far as Bhai is concerned, let him think we ran away with the stock. 'Please arrange for us to escape from here.' We'll lead the rest of our lives in a different city. I swear, apart from the two of us, no one knows it. Again, are you trying to get me trapped? Did Bhai ask you to check my commitment? I have stock worth Rs. 2.5 Billion. Take ten minutes to think about it and call me back. If you can hand over the stock to me, without Bhai knowing about it I will help you and your family to have a clean exit from this. The deal is between the two of us! Look, I am not doing this for the stock or money. I don't want four innocent souls to die! 'All said and done, I was the one who recruited you!' 'So, let me save you!' 'If we go as per my plan, we can finish the deal without Bhai's notice.' Sir, did you hear that? How can I trust someone like this and transport 100 Kilos? So, I had to.. I've caught her, Bhai. She is with me. What should I do now? 'Hand over the phone to her.' Talk to him! Hello, sir! 'You'll find a room behind you, go into it.' Okay, sir! 'Turn left, go near the cupboard.' 'Open it.' 'Open the locker!' 'The pin is 1476.' 'Take the gun!' 'Take it!' Bhai! Bhai! Bhai! Please don't. Bhai! Bhai, listen to me. Shoot him in the mouth, that spelled our plan to betray this Bhai! Bhai! Bhai! Bhai! - Listen to me, Bhai. - I can't do this, sir. Get this done by someone else, sir. Please, sir. Bhai! - 'Put me on speaker!' Bhai, please don't do it! Bhai! Bhai! I did it by mistake, Bhai. Bhai, I will never do this again! Boy, place the gun in his mouth. Bhai, listen to me. He struck a deal with you. So, he has to die in your hands. Shoot him down! Shoot! If you don't shoot him now, I'll shoot your entire family down. What did you do now? - I changed the group's name, Bro. To what? - Struggling for Shobi! Super! - Thanks, Bro! I don't need this anymore. Take it. Keep it with you! - Anything for Shobi! Anything for Shobi! The package will be delivered in an hour. Check and let me know. Okay, Uncle! Hey, stop the van. Get away! - Sir, please sir. My mom is unwell, sir. We are taking her to the hospital. Move aside. Every one of them here looks like a fraud! As a Policeman, I can easily identify. - Look here, sir. I also have her health reports. Sir! There's nothing in it, sir. Whoa! So much of cocaine. - Sir! You have smuggled drugs. Don't act innocent now. Ask one of our men to drive the van. Bhai, Police has seized our stock. 'Tell me, Bhai!' Sir, your department has seized our stock. How do we approach that Police Officer, sir? Bhai, I am unable to stand the torture of this crazy Inspector. 'Please let go of the stock.' Hey, it is close to 90 Kilos. Bhai, you cut the call. Let me check and get back. 90 Kilos! Hey dude! Hey! Bring two tender coconuts. Hey, don't open it. Just get it here. Thanks, dude! Sir, my payment? Why should I pay? I am the Police. Which station, sir? Police Station! Hello! Bhai, no one from our department has seized your stock. Someone dressed like a cop 'has taken it away.' - Hey! Apart from Police, who has the audacity to seize my stock in Tamil Nadu? Alphonse! You tried to cheat this Alphonse, by sending me packs of salt. See, how I trapped you! Billy, let's split the stock between us after a month. 'We'll have Rs. 2.5 Billion as profit.' Let Bhai keep worrying about the stock like a girl! What do I do with these six people? Why don't you admit them in medical college and make them doctors? Fool, slit their throats and throw them away! Billy, just a minute! 'Yes, tell me' - Check the stock completely. Last incident was very bad. Billy, I hope it is not salt again. No! - Super! It's sugar this time. Sugar? What do I do with it? Should I make a sweet? Does she think I am running a provision store 'to supply salt and sugar?' Billy, you know the gentle Alphonse who tenders plants. But, there is a wild side to me. I don't care what you do. In the next five minutes, we'll have to know where the stock is. Idiot! Brother, she has packed sugar in everything. How do we extract information from her? She will say it now! Hey! Are you a rogue? Why are you raising your hands on her? Until they confess the truth, shoot one after another. Dear God! I knew he would begin with me. Bro, please. Bro, actually I am an outsider. Family members are on the other side. If you want her to confess, her dad is sitting right on the right corner start with him. Hey, I dare you to shoot me before you touch anyone in that family. I can't act as per your wishes. You are not my boss. Hey! If you are man of valor, remove our handcuffs.. Hey! Ask him to shut up! - Ignore him, he is mad. Hey! - Turn this side. Keep quiet. He might shoot us down. - You! You brainless idiot! Brother, he is innocent. Please don't harm him. - Don't do it, Brother. Stock is with Chinna Annachi. Damari, Devar Street, Patupalli, Gummudipundi- 601 201. Billy, I'll go check the stock and call you. Please attend. Sure! Are we all set? Yes, Brother! Start the car! Hey, if you are capable of smuggling 100 Kilos with these amateurs you are one smart woman! You! - Hey! Brother, I am feeling frustrated. You can take out your frustration on the one next. If you lay hands on Shobi I'll break your bones, cut you to pieces, grind you and will swallow it. Why, dude? Love, Bro! Hey, why do you stare at him? I'm in love with the younger one. If I can get so worked up he is in love with the elder one. Think about it. They are mad! Wait till he gets his hands on you. He'll beat the pulp out of you, dunk you in acid skin you alive and will drag every last ounce of life out of you! No, sir. I won't do so. Bro, did I even say a word against you? Then, why do you trust this idiot and hit me? Did you see that? What next, dude? - I am soft by nature. He is rough and tough! Not at all, Bro. I am the innocent one in this group. Hey, he is the one talking. Why are you hitting me? Let me get beaten for what I say. Do you know what I'll do to you? I'll cut you to pieces, marinate with spices, boil you up dry you in hot sun and will finally grind you to fine powder, mix it with water and feed the monkey sitting there. I will drink the remaining mix and go to sleep. Next morning, I will just gargle you out you scoundrel! - Simply superb, Bro. You've gone to a different league, Bro! Bhai, I'll take care of everything here. Please don't worry. Come here as soon as you can. We'll trace your stock together. My flight is at 9. I should be there by 1 PM. Until then, please take care. Bro! He has become tired. Mom! Mom! Sir, mom needs water. She needs to take her tablet. Please give some water, sir. Shut up! This isn't a hospital. Hey, she is asking for water. Give her some. What is this, Brother? - Remove their handcuffs! Give it to me. Hey! Don't tie her up. Move! Come with me! Sir, why should I? Come! - Sir! Sir! Please let me go. Please, sir. - Don't do this, Brother. Come with me! - Hey! Why is he calling Kokila's mom? Bro, he is calling Kokila! Kokila! Didn't I offer water immediately when you asked? Why do you refuse to come, when I call you? - No, sir! Sir! Sir, please. - Don't harm her, dear. Don't harm her. Please let us go. Please be considerate! Don't harm her. My daughter is innocent. Mom! Kokila, don't go. - Hey! Kokila! Don't go, Kokila. - Fine! Kokila, don't go, dear. - Sister! Kokila! Please stop him. - Sister! 'She'll be back in ten minutes.' Kokila! Bro, they are going to destroy your lover. I feel disgusted. - Doesn't it bother you? I am crying. Can't you see that? I can't even see your eyes, Bro! How can you? They have punctured my face completely. Sir! Sir! Please don't! Please, sir! Let's not do this, sir. - Hey! Okay, sir. Go on! Sir! Sir! Please don't! It's wrong. Please, sir! Sir! Sir! Please call for my parents. What if your men killed them while I am here? They won't do anything without my instruction. No, sir. I'll feel comfortable with my parents around. Only then, I won't disturb you. Won't you feel awkward with them around? No, sir. I'll feel better, if they are around. I haven't done it in parents' presence. I am just obliging your request. Dugga, bring them here. Hey, come fast. Don't push me, Bro. Come! Hey, come fast! We are trying our best. - Dugga! Don't bring those two! Untie these three and send them here. Hey, three of you go there. Kokila! - Hey! Dear God! This is new to me. But, it's fine. Come! Sir! Sir! Sir! Please don't, sir. Sir! Sir! Sir! Listen to me. Let me go! I feel disgusted, sir. My dad is here. You turn around. Hey, turn around. Sir! Sir! Please don't. Sir, please! Dear God! Dad! Hey, what are you doing to my daughter? As long as I am alive, you cannot harm her. You! You! Give me a hand! Do you think you are a hero? Sir! Sir! Please, sir. - 'Gosh!' Hey! Spare my daughter. Kokila, run away. Go! Go! Shobi, Go! - Kokila, run away! Go, Shobi! - Shobi, both of you run away. Please let us go, sir. - Runaway! Go away, dear. Anyhow, I am going to die in two months. Out of grief, I am sure your dad will die subsequently. Please don't think about us. Shobi! Just leave! Run away! Please spare us, sir. - Go! Please, sir. - Where are you going? They may ask you to leave. Don't you have sense? You cannot escape from my boys! So, come. Lay down! Please, sir. We don't have a choice. We'll have to do this. I am sure in the next one hour, he'll kill us. This is our last chance. Let's try it out! Fool, are you going to sleep with him? No, Mom. I am going to kill him. Pick up any tool you find. Sir, she is just blabbering out of fear. Please don't mistake her. Hey fool, take a good look at sir. He is six feet tall. How can we kill him? We can't kill you, sir! She doesn't even realize that. Very innocent she is. Please let us go, sir. No, sir. Please spare us. We have a lot of trouble because of her, sir. I'll definitely change her, sir. Look how she got us trapped here, sir. I'll take care of her. Please forgive us, sir. Hey, you asked me to kill him. What are you waiting for? Come along! Sister! Sister! Sister! - Shobi! Don't cry, Shobi! - My sister! My sister is tired. - I can't see you cry, Shobi. She needs water. - My heart pains, Shobi. My sister is.. - I'll kill all of them, Shobi! bleeding! - I'll take care of you. My sister is tired. - I can't see you cry, Shobi. Can you give her some water? - Don't worry, Shobi. I am here. They ruined my lover. - Don't cry, Shobi. They have destroyed my love completely! - Bro! Shobi is crying, Bro. - My sister is tired. Hey! - Please bring some water. Shobi is asking for water. - Do you want water? Please give her some water. - I'll send it across. Bro, Shobi is asking for water. - Please give her some water. Bro! Bro! At least send some water for her. Who is he to give her water, Bro? Bro! Bro, Please! Sincere love, Bro. Bro, please show some respect for love. Let him take the water. Bro, please! - Hold this. Be careful! Bro! Bro! Bro! Hey, if you lay hands on Kokila, I'll start swearing your parents. Hey! - Sister! Billy! Sister! Sister! Sister is tired. - Gosh! My sister is bleeding. She is tired. She needs a little water. My sister is tired. Bro, her sister is tired again! They ruined your love for the second time. I am good at counting! I know! He dares to remove his shirt right in front of me. God, please save Kokila! Hey Dugga, are you done? Yet again? Why is she coming again and again, Bro? What's happening there? Why do you keep asking for water? Are you playing some kind of a game? These guys are entering in the pretext of serving water. Hello, Bro! Bro! - Hey! Sister needs water. - She'll shut the door now. Watch! Hey, let me sit inside. Please! Sister! Sister! God! - Hey! Stay silent. Okay! Hey! It's fine even if they shoot me down! I am going to go there. Where are you going, Bro? Do you want to see her in this state? These guys must be sitting around her in an undressed state. Do you want to go see it? Undressed? I feel like dying, when I hear all this. Bro, they might have raped your lover. But, not your love. Your love still remains pure! Please prove it, Bro. Correct! I will! I will prove my love. You are the only support for Kokila, Bro. Only you can give her a life. Please think about your love for her. Forget the rest, Bro. You are a true gentleman, Bro. Kokila, this is a black day in our love! Forget all this! I will too! Let's just think we were attacked by some street dogs. I will never bring this up again or hurt you! I will marry you! Let's lead a life together. I'll make you the owner of my shop. I swear upon the Goddess of Sky! Darling, should we finish him too? Mom, don't bother. - What did you say? Bro, they have committed murder as a family! Really? Yes, Bro! They have committed murders. Their hands are stained with blood. Your love is pure! Your love is great, bro! She has committed murders for you. Sir, that's the van. I have solved a lot of cases so far. But, I have never felt accomplished. Now, I have caught your family red-handed. I feel extremely proud and happy! I don't think even Military force could have done it. I'll go boasting around! Sir, even now, you have not caught the actual criminals. You have just caught an innocent family! Even without us, the trade will continue. You don't have to worry about that. I've caught you! I know how to catch the rest! It's very difficult, sir. I am sure they'll kill you before it or get you transferred from here. If I help you, we can nab them before either of this happens. If you promise to spare our family, I'll help you! If you let us go, I'll help you nab the head in Bombay and also hand over the 9 kilos of cocaine to you. If you do as promised, I'll definitely let you and your family go scot-free! Do you trust my words or should I give it in writing? This will do, sir. Mukhil! - Sir!' I have sent you an address. 'Yes, sir.' - You'll find 90 Kilos of cocaine there. Shift it to Karpagambal Mess and assign an officer to take care of it. No one should know about it. Okay? 'Okay, sir.' Please come, sir. For the first time.. What, Venu? Are you ready to take Police's side at least today? Hello! I think that girl is moving out of this town. When are you coming? I'll be there in an hour. Please make sure she does not go! 'Hello!' Hello, Sekar. I need a small favor from you. 'Tell me, Kokila. What do you want?' There's some money at the place I am going to tell you. Please tell them Inspector Guru sent you. They'll give you the money. 'Where should I go?' Karpagambal Mess. They'll give you a green color bag. Please listen carefully. It's a green color bag. Can you please bring it for me? 'Don't trouble me after this.' Sure! Hey! Keep it low! You are heard outside. Don't you want to bid farewell before you leave the town? That's fine! But, you should tell me where my stock is. If you tell me, I'll spare all of you alive. I am sure you are not going to believe me if I say so. But, I promise. I'll let you go! Madam! We are getting late. Only if we leave now, we'll reach there by dawn. Get out! Where is the package? Gosh! Sir, thanks a lot! We'll leave now. Where are you going? You have made a mistake. As per law, you must be punished if you have committed a crime. I completely agree with it. Sir, you said you'd let us go, if we helped you nab him. I was lying! - Sir, what is this? Why do you keep.. Why do you keep going back on your word? Sir! Sir! Please don't do this, sir. Sir, please.. - I have caught 90 Kilos of cocaine along with the criminals. Come as fast as you can! Sir! Sir! - Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Please, sir! Sir, this is unfair! Does it look like we did this for money? What did you do it for? The nation? Actually, I should have shot you down. But, I am sparing you alive, only because you helped me nab him. Sir! I have an idea, sir. - Tell me, sir. My wife and I will admit to the mistake and surrender. Please spare my two daughters, sir. You want to take the blame? Your wife will die before we reach the court. You'll die before the next hearing. Only I will have to attend the hearings then! What a foolish idea. Going by the looks, you don't look anything more than a pancake vendor. Yet, you have managed to smuggle drugs. Sir, I had to save my mother. I didn't know what to do. Hence, we committed this mistake. A wrong can never set anything right. It just remains a mistake! Sir! Sir, let me explain. Give me the records. Give it to me. He might understand if he takes a look at it. - Calm down, Mom. Please wait, dear. - Calm down, Mom. Let me show it to you, sir. I'll explain, sir. Take a look at this file, sir. Sir, this is my file. We need money. Hold on! Sir, we'll need about Rs. 1.5 Million for my treatment. She was just trying to save me, sir. - Okay! Hold on, dear. She is too fond of me, sir. Go on! - She did all this only to save me! I swear, we'll do nothing of this sort again, sir. Please excuse us, sir. - Mom! We'll leave this town and lead our lives elsewhere, sir. She didn't realize the consequences. Sorry, sir. Mom! Hey, having done everything, don't act like an innocent! I'll kill you! Kokila, you are right, dear. We'll have to go your way, to deal with this guy. What did you do? Shobi! I wanted to relax. Where are you taking me, dear? Who wants to see me at this hour, dear? Honey, what are you doing here? You look like a van driver! What are you doing here? I told you I was going for a massage. But, this isn't a massage parlor. At a massage parlor, I get massage only for 1.5 hours. But, here they offer me a full night's massage. Complete relaxation. If you don't let us go I'll tell the officials that all five of us were engaged in the trade. Then, you'll have to arrest all five of us. Sorry, sir. Poor thing, sir. We are all innocent! Sir, this is Inspector Guru. - I am Krishna! Where is the accused? Is it these people? No, sir. Three people are accused. Two are outside, one is dead. What happened? Sir, I seized 90 Kilos of Cocaine from them. As a revenge, he held my wife and her friends as hostage. So, I had to shoot out! So, you'll do everything on your own and inform us at last. Am I correct? Sorry, sir! Where is the substance? It's at Karpagambal Mess, sir. Check it! You may leave. It's getting late for you! Sorry! - Sure, sir. Keep this in your bag, dear. I asked you to take these photo frames. Why didn't you take it? Go do it now! Hurry up! We have to leave. Sorry, sir. I didn't do it on purpose. You catch hold of criminals. I was certain you'll be double smart. So, I didn't trust you too! Kokila, this bag had more money than the one you had mentioned. Is it okay? What did she do? Tell me! Answer me! Open your mouth. Sir, one person has already murdered four people and is committing the fifth murder. I didn't do it, sir. Trust me! He is admitting to the murder, sir. Can I arrest him? Sir! Sir! Sir, I am innocent. - Come on! Come along! - Just a minute, sir. I am going to say something. Please hear me out. What is it? Dad, he hasn't paid us for the previous stock either. If he is going to continue like this, it won't be the same anymore. Do you hear me? Please collect money for this along with previous dues. Be strict with him. If you stand like a doll, we can't carry on business like this. Here, take it. Here! It isn't enough if you just buy the stock. You must also pay for it. After all, you are selling 'Rangoli' powder. Don't act like a business magnet. How much do I owe you? An old balance of Rs. 420! Current balance Rs.420! So, Rs. 840! Cool! Here, take the cash. Maintain the tray properly. Don't act as though this is some precious object! Where is the old tray? Here, take it. Given a choice, you'd just keep it. Dear! Did you check properly? Is there Rs. 840? Yes, dear! You can count it. 'Hello, Mom!' - 'Yeah, tell me.' 'We are going to the temple this evening. Do you remember?' 'Yes, I do.' - 'Ask Shobi not to go out.' 'She is at home.' - 'We'll be there at 5PM.' 'Do you want something?' 'One packet of milk and 250gms of Coffee Powder.' 'Okay, bye!'
