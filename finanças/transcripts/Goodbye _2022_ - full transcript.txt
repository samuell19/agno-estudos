Yes? Ma'am… you forgot your phone in the bar last night. Thank you. Someone was calling all night So… Papa? Yes, Papa? Give me a moment. Where's mom? Where were you all night? We were at a party. I've been trying to reach everyone since last night. Karan isn't picking up. Nakul's phone is off. What is it, Papa? How does it matter? Does it make a difference to you? Papa, please don't start again and that too early in the morning. Why don't you have a landline? I've been calling since 5:00 a.m. Landline? Who uses landline number these days? It's for those who care! Papa, it's been months since you called. And that too… Never mind. Why don't you shout mom? She wants me to vent out at mom. No. I don't need the money. -Please take it. -No, ma'am. I live right here in front of the Tiwari's clinic. First, I thought I'd send the phone with a friend. Then I thought that I know you. I've seen you so often. I thought I'd bring it myself. So… Last night, your father was calling again and again. I answered the call. And he said that your mother had passed away. What? Your mother is dead. Maybe you should call back? Sorry, ma'am. My beloved mother Who was it, Tara? My beloved mother -My beloved mother -What happened, Tara? My beloved mother What happened? How does it matter to you? Why don't you all continue partying? That's all you're interested in. I had to tell a waiter that your mom was dead. A waiter! But Papa, I didn't know. I'm sorry. She didn't know… So I must just sit around waiting for her to die? How could she leave us like that? I missed all her phone calls. I didn't reply to her messages. I read them but I didn't reply. I can't even tell her I won my first case! What do I do? Come on, Papa, have your juice. Papa. Papa! I don't know if Geeta… has told… Gayatri's father or not. I think I should go myself. But who will look after… things here? There's so much to do. No one even knows about it yet. Should I post it on Ms. Gayatri's Facebook page? Yes, use her phone. Where is her phone? What about Karan? Karan is taking the night flight. Nakul isn't answering his phone. Drink your juice, Papa. You haven't eaten anything since morning. Not now. Okay I have called the ambulance. Done. Listen, we… need some ice as well. And we need… to book an ambulance. Everything will be done, Papa. Don't take unnecessary stress. -And-- -Please drink your juice, Papa. Listen. Where are my slippers? You're wearing them, Papa. You're wearing them. Oh, right. Economy seats are booked. Shall I book the business class? How much is it? 35,000 rupees for a one way ticket. Just handle it, Mudassar. And book one for you as well. You know it will upset your father. But you know mom loved you. I know, Tara. But just go be with your family. Obviously, I'll come to the cremation. Have you told him? No. We've talked to the doctors. He's still very weak. I don't think I can come to the cremation… but I'll try. I promise. What happened? Where's Gayatri? Isn't Gayatri coming? Take some rest. She'll be here soon. Papa, Nakul's phone is still unreachable. Did you send a message? Yes, I've messaged him. "Come home. Mom not well." All right. Did he eat? Come on. Stupid… didn't you eat anything? Here. Come on. Eat your food. Have a little. Come on, eat some for Gayatri. Just a little. Yeah, can you hear me now? Patrick, I told you I'm going to be back in 15 days, okay? Yeah. I am… I'm going to make the presentation and send it to you from there. Excuse me ma'am, your Hindu meal is confirmed. Thank you, I'll have the chicken, please. I'm so sorry but chicken is not included in the Hindu meal. Wha… But I love the chicken. I mean, the Indian spicy chicken. I'm so sorry. It's my favorite. Listen, I'll try and wrap it up in four to five days, okay? Yeah, I am going to do that for you. Okay, bye. Wrap it up? What? Sweetie… you're not going for a project. Of course not. That's not what I… So stupid! I forgot to buy my smokes. I forgot to buy cigarettes because of the stress. -Sorry. Give me two minutes. -What? Yes, Papa? Yes, Papa. Right here. Hold on a second. Yes, Papa? My flight is booked. I'm coming via Dubai. Yes, I will. Are you all right? Okay, Papa. I'll see you. -Can you go to slide number 17, please? -Yes. Yeah. Sure… Correct the first line. Please change that. Hi, can I have a large Glen, please? Thank you. ALL THE BEST DID YOU WIN THE CASE? Give it to her. Karan, come here. -Come here, love. -Leave me! I want to marry Delna. I don't want to get the rakhi tied. Mom… Can we roll the cotton smaller? Auntie, are you all right? Where do I put the holy basil? Okay, right. Shall I use the big leaf or small? Okay. Sorry, Auntie. It's done, sir. It's done, sir. This is so sad. -Tea? -What is this? Tea? I generally drink black coffee. But I don't need anything right now. -Tea? -No. Oh. I better have half a cup of tea. Tea? My foot is numb. I'm not used to sitting on the floor. We came first but they snaffled the chairs. For the next three you won't light the gas stove. It would be a bad omen. Tea? You can have tea. How did she die of heart attack? Everyone knows that ladies don't have heart attacks. Gayatri used to exercise a lot. She was fit. She'd daily go for morning walks. She'd be wearing those… What are they called? -Air pods. -Yes, that's what I meant. What are you up to? Sister, I am doing everything that the priest asked me to do. That's why I started walking as well. -Really? -I go every morning. It's important. Once I am done with my morning tea or coffee I put on my shoes and go for a walk. I bought new shoes as well. They cost around 15,000 to 20,000 rupees. But they are really comfy. They are amazing! Do you walk every day? Every single day. But Gayatri and I never saw you. Because, you know… Now who will walk with me? Don't worry. I'm still here. I'll go with you. We will go together. We can get my driver to take us. Grab those chairs if these guys get up. I can't sit here any longer. Priest… I've put the phone on speaker. Let me know what you will need for the next few days. -Note it down. -Go on. Two kilogram of ghee. Okay, ghee. -Half a kilogram of rice. -Rice. Cottonwool. Cotton… -Get a packet of camphor. -Camphor? Do we have camphor at home? Do you have camphor? -We'll get camphor, sir. -Okay. It will be enough for two or three days. We'll make sure there's enough for two or three days. -One more thing. -Yes? Get the rolled wicks. Okay. -Make sure they are rolled wicks. -Yes. Or it will take time to make them. I agree. Hello, sir. Did he hang up? PP, you have to tell us what to do. Leave it to me. I don't think my brain is working. Gayatri handled everything. Don't worry about a thing. We'll do everything to make sure her soul gets peace. What is going on here? Mom never liked these rituals. -If she had been here-- -Is she here? Is she here? Dear, what don't you like? All this drama. There's cotton in her nose, her feet are tied up, -and she's lying on the ground-- -This is not drama. -This is tradition, right PP? -Right. Tradition is the problem. There's no logic to it. I think we should respect the wishes of the dead. How can we find that out? Wake her up and ask her! Calm down. Tara didn't pick her call for two days. She kept calling you all night. What happened to your logic then? Dear, she's dead. And we need to do this for the dead. -He just wants to argue. -She'll come around. Look at the way she is talking! Look! There's an empty chair. Make sure this water don't flow into the plants. Someone get a mop. Make sure it doesn't flow here. Well, we could move auntie a little and then the water could flow that way. The body's alignment is all wrong. It should be lying on the North-South axis. You've kept it facing East. You two, come here. -You two, come here. Not you. -Coming. Come here. Quick. -I'll be right back. -Come here. Put your body to some use. Come. Not with footwear. Take off your footwear. Come fast, child. Hurry up. Two of you hold her head and two of you hold her feet. Come here. Great! She's with us. Lift it up carefully and turn. We were very close to Gayatri. Be careful. Good. Thank you. Good. Lift it. Turn it around. Good. -Turn it. -Oh, God! Let her be. What difference does it make? What do you mean? Of course it makes a difference. She has to go peacefully. Will she will go peacefully if you keep shifting her like this? The body must be aligned to the energy patterns of the universe. Your mother is no longer with us but… I am just explaining to her that… Gayatri is no longer with us. We just have her soul with us. The soul that seeks release but on its own terms. What are you up to? Looking for the North. For the next 13 days, she will wander around here… about 12 feet above the ground. She is waiting. She is waiting. She is watching from her vantage point, 12 feet above us. Now the soul must decide where it needs to go. The soul is listening to what we are thinking and saying about her. Where is the north? -Where is the North director? -It's here. No, it's here. I think it's here. So move her. Why have you stopped? -And hurry up. -But be careful. -I know it's here. -I know! That's what I said. The North is here. -Hey-- -No! The milkman comes from there. The North must be there. You always cause confusion. Where does the sun rise? Somewhere around here. Then the North must be somewhere here. Hello, I'm busy right now. North must be here. Put her here. This must be the North. Right, this is North. I'll come later. Not now. Take it easy. Don't hurt her. Has anyone spoken to the priest? -Did it hurt, Auntie? -Chetan. I think I might just kill someone. Auntie… Out of the way. Call the priest. Chetan. My battery is dying. Call me up. Auntie. Do you remember how she could knock it back? Now, I… Gayatri was a happy soul. Yes! Always smiling. Listen, do you have a photo that can be put behind your body? I think it's best to have one ready. I don't have one myself. All of them are group photographs. And no one prints photos these days. They're all dumped on the phone. If you're going get a photo clicked, then it better be a smiling photograph. Why would I smile in a photo that is going to be put up next to my corpse? My smile used to knock them dead in the streets. So, my smiling photograph should be put up after my death. It will be amazing! Greetings. Will you move a little? I was saying that… they won't be cooking for three days. So we should send them food. Have you just arrived? I have been here! What about the food for the next three days? I've soaked chickpeas. I will send the food today. I'll make some more. -Harish loves the food I prepare. -All right. Tomorrow, I'll make aloo matar. I have peas stored in the fridge. We bought a new fridge of 480 liters. So, I froze the peas. You get fresh peas throughout the year in Sector 17. Really? No need. I have them already. -I'll send some rotis. -Yes. That will be perfect. Send the turnip pickle as well. It will be a great finishing touch. Gayatri loved turnip pickle. She's been with Ms. Gayatri since she was five years old. She looked after her. Once she came here with me and she didn't even want to go home. Ms. Gayatri insisted on sending her to school. Now we must go home, right? Enough. Calm down. Hello? Hello, Papa. Papa… I'm stuck in Dubai. I am getting a connecting flight to Delhi. No problem, dear. Please try to come soon. Papa, don't worry. I'll take a cab to Chandigarh. Just don't worry, please. Papa, give me a second. Just hold on. Just keep it here. Yes. Sir, your butter chicken and butter garlic naan. Anything else? No. Get me a diet coke? Get some beer as well. What was that, Papa? I said, get yourself some beer as well. No, Papa, I'm not… It's not… Now that you're having a party, you might as well go all the way. Papa, I'm not even hungry. I'm just-- Hello? Papa… Sir? Buddy… can I get some khichdi? No one eats simple food at a shradh. The food must be vegetarian, but it can't be simple. Call him. Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Dear… a crow could be a soul. It could be Ms. Gayatri seeking moksha. She was here for moksha. We've heard it as well, dear. It is true. What have you heard? The crow has a human soul in it? What crap are you saying? You're supposed to be educated people. Keep your old thoughts to yourself, please. I can't believe what nonsense you're-- My beloved mother My beloved mother My beloved mother My beloved mother Mom! Can I borrow these? No. You are very careless. I let you take my blue studs the last time and you lost it. You can't take them. What a Scrooge! You never share anything with me. I don't care what you say. Those are my favorites. You can't take them. Are you going to take them with you? One day they'll be mine. Shameless girl. You're talking about your mother's death just for a pair of earring. You won't let me have them when you're alive. My beloved mother My beloved mother -Careful. -Brother Karan. Oh, no. I was handling it all alone. Sorry, Papa. I took the first available flight. Never mind. Now that you're here… take charge of everything. Go on. It might be important. It's your phone. -Yes? -Brother-in-law. Did you tell Papa? I told him. You know him well. Then? He was saying that he is more worldly-wise than me. And as to why I hid it from him. Just let him… recover from dengue and we'll be right over. Geeta, they'll all be gone soon and I'll be alone. Auntie Geeta? Come then. That'll be better. Papa, Auntie Geeta… Hello, how's granddad? He's well. Are you okay? They've put mom on the floor. There's cotton in her nose. She is just lying on the floor. Meanwhile everyone's running around blindly. Let them get on with it. Whether it's your father or someone else, let them do whatever they like. Try to understand. Are they doing this for themselves or for mom? And Papa is on his own trip. So what? He's not in a good place. Don't be stubborn. My mother has just died. I'm not in a good place either. I'm entitled to my stubbornness. Bye, guys. Mom, it's done. I've found a place to stay in Bombay. Thank God. I was so worried. The flight is in two days. Where is it? -You remember Ashish from Delhi? -Yes? I did my final submission with him. He has a two-bedroom apartment and was looking for a flatmate. I said I was in. Stay in a hotel. You can shift when you've found the right place. What does that mean? It is the right place. A two-year lease! No need to stay alone with a man. I'll book you into a hotel. He's not just any boy. I know him. He's a good guy. Mom, say something. You know him but I don't. I said I'm booking a hotel until you find something. End of topic. End of topic? I can't afford a hotel, Papa. I will book a hotel. I don't want to be dependent on anyone after I get my first salary. In fact, I'm going to send some money home. Really? She has become Ms. Independent all of a sudden! You remember who paid for this independence of yours. I worked day and night to make sure you got a good education. And now, with your first salary, you want to send money home. It offends you to take my money now? It's not an insult. I want to make you proud. If you want to make me proud then you better learn how to talk to your elders. She's been like this since childhood. Has she ever paid heed to anyone? What do you mean? I will accept the statements that I can understand. If I don't understand, then I won't accept! What an arrogant girl! You are stubborn! From today, I'm not going to ask you anything. I won't tell you anything even if you ask me. Thank God, I'm leaving the day after. And so it goes. Angry words and slammed doors. You can fight all you want… but don't stain the pillows with your hair dye. The color will rub off. What's going on? Return ticket? No. I was just doing some research. Checking on flight timings. Daisy just-- We just need to know the timings. Are you already planning to go? Did you manage to reach Nakul? No, Papa. I just can't get through to anyone. All ready for tomorrow? So you managed without me? Don't you guys have anything to talk about? Hey! Did you wish Karan and Daisy for their anniversary? I reminded you. Now all of you will keep track of these things yourself. But don't forget to wish each other. You never know when the other person won't be with you anymore. And you, buddy? Got some time off from work? What about you, Stupid? Why are you sulking? Why are you raging at them? Are you afraid to be abandoned? Is this the only photograph you could find? Do you remember how much I drank that day? Shit, I was so drunk! Now where's my favorite? Eating butter chicken in Dubai. When does Angad land tomorrow? Six o'clock. What? Six in the morning, Papa. So who's going to the market? I'll go, Papa. What else do you need? -Rope? -Earthen pot. Got that. We need two pots, one big and one small. And panchgavya. Sorry, what? I am talking about panchgavya. It is made of cow milk, curd, ghee, and urine. Ghee and cow-- What was that? Urine. Cow… Why don't you talk to the man yourself? Please speak to him. Sure. This is nonsense. Let's just do an electric cremation. You'll need the same things for that as well. And seven gold coins. Of course, seven gold coins. Seven what? Gold coins. Yes. Seven gold coins? Harish all this has to be done. Gold coins! This is a business. No, it's a racket. Indeed, it's a business. And what a business model. It's because one day, we all fetch up here, don't we? Yes, and what time do we expect the ambulance? Turn it. -I'm getting another call, just wait. -You come. -The eldest son takes this. -Okay. Please come forward. Just hold on. One second. Lift her up. Careful. Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Careful. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Hello? -Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Yeah, 4:00 p.m. is good. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. -I think-- Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. -I'll call you back. No, this is all wrong. Her head should be in the front. PP, her feet should be in the front. I've done this thousands of times. Come here, son. Go on. That's right. Now turn this side. All the short guys can lift it higher. -Great, now move forward. -It will fall down. No worries. Turn it around. Easy! Careful! Turn it over there. Come on. Don't rush it, Great. Now come this side. Easy. Well done. Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Mudassar. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. -Mudassar, come here. Lord Rama's name is the truth. Lord Rama's name is the truth. -No worries. That's alright. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. Lord Rama's name is the truth. -We need the earthen pot as well. -Lord Rama's name is the truth. Bring the pot. Bring it fast. What are you waiting for? Lord Rama's name is the truth. Lord Rama's name is the truth. Lord Rama's name is the truth. But Harish, you're already paying for three children. Do you want to adopt a child? Ms. Durga, you know this was my first home. I grew up here. I only got myself a family when she came into my life. Which was why we decided that when we could afford it, we would adopt a child. This will not require any hardwork and my figure will remained maintained. Isn't that right? Tell the driver that I'll give him the instructions. We want to come along. I don't think it's allowed but… PP, should we leave? Let me sort this out. Where is the bag with all essentials? -No, let's leave it inside. -Okay. -Why? -I think it might take some time. How much time? About fifteen to twenty minutes. There are two cremations ahead of us. We are third. Let me have a word with the priest. I've come here thousands of times. I said we should go to the electric crematorium. No. We spoke to the priest and he said that only a wood fire ensures salvation. What? I think it's going to take another ten or fifteen minutes, Papa. Something… to do with salvation. What do we do until then? Nakul? How could I miss this? I mean… I literally read up on everything. We wear black to a funeral. -I just didn't know this whole… -It's okay. Makes no difference. Karan didn't even tell me. So stupid! No. Don't worry. I will tell. Myself, PP Singh. Family friend. Child, Yamraj… the God of Death… he takes life from everybody… including foreigner. Now the soul leaves the body but sometimes it tries to enter again. And that is why we block the nose. See that? Yes. And tie the feet thumbs. It is important. -And then… -We cut the astral chord. The chord that connects the body and the soul. It is the astral chord. That's what I said. Same thing. What is your name? Who named this group? "Gayatri Death 2022"? Not me. I am talking about the WhatsApp group. Yesterday we had to add someone, right? I thought… Who would name a group like that? Let's not fight. Let's crack of a nice name instead. Harish is going to be lonely… so we can call it "Lonely Harish." If Harish had to feature in the name, then why not it be… "Harish Needs Us"? I think that if the group is about Gayatri, -then the title should feature her name. -Absolutely. Quite right. But she's no longer among us. How about… "Gone Gayatri Gone"? "Gone Gayatri Gone"? That's a movie title, right? Gayatri is no more but we have a group in her name. And we will be with her. Do you remember what she used to call us? What? Chandigarh Bubblies. That will be the name of the group. Chandigarh Bubblies. Okay. What is it? -Ten more minutes. -Okay. Make me the admin of the group. I'll change the name. -I have done it. -Go ahead with it. We should take a selfie. All of us are wearing white clothes. Let's click a selfie and make it the profile photo. -Come close. -Okay. Gayatri's Bubblies! Why does the son get to do the cremation? Why does the son get to do the cremation? What? She was my mother as well. So why shouldn't I light her pyre? You haven't changed, Tara. Just follow what has been told. Just do what I'm told and never bother about what it means? Are you all right? You? I… Last night, I gave her some water to drink and she looked fine. She was asking… whether I had replied to you. Did mom read my mail? I asked her to read it. She said… "That twitbunny must have written something… that will make me blush." Twitbunny? Mom was… It's our turn. My beloved mother My beloved mother My beloved mother My beloved mother Memories come Flooding altogether My beloved mother My beloved mother Why do I feel You are sitting close to me? Each second is a trial In what I've thought and what I have done All I see is you In my blood and in my bone All I need is you My beloved mother When I think of you My eyes fill, my tears spill My beloved mother When I think of you My eyes fill, my tears spill That laugh of yours That sob of yours What will this life be without you? When I was hurt When it cut deep Your face was the balm Your face, it was your face My beloved mother When I think of you My eyes fill, my tears spill My beloved mother When I think of you My eyes fill, my tears spill My beloved mother In your shade My beloved mother I want to stay My beloved mother In your shade My beloved mother My eyes fill, my tears spill Stupid. Stupid. Hey, Stupid. Stupid. Hey, my boy. Yes, Papa? What is it? We just cremated your mom a while back. Yes. Cremation! And… And the two of you… And the two of you are… What is this? What is this? Basically you don't care. You will leave soon as well. Now that you are done with your duty, you will escape. And then all you will bother about is work and parties. Who cares about old parents? What is this? I mean… What is… Feelings! What do you feel? You've become an American. This is how they do things over there. They cremate their mother in the day and run after your wife in the night. -It's bloody disappointing-- -She wasn't just your wife, Papa. She was my mother as well. That wasn't what I was up to. That didn't… cross my mind. I wasn't in the mood. -Oh, not in the mood? -No. So what were you in the mood for, buddy? Tell me all about your moods. Mom wanted to become a grandmother. I had promised her… a grandchild on her birthday. That's what we were up to. Daisy is… on fertility medication. And if we miss it, then we've got to start again from scratch. And who are we doing all this for? It's for you. So you two could be granddad and grandmom. We weren't having fun, Papa. That's the problem. What is the problem, Papa? Smoking! What? Smoking is the problem! Gayatri and I conceived you on the first night of our marriage. Had you quit smoking, she wouldn't need tablets. We would have been grandparents by now. So no smoking! -Okay? -What are you talking about? Can we focus on one thing at a time? So now you're going to teach me how to suck eggs? You're going to teach me how to argue? You must have booked your tickets already? When are you leaving? What on earth is going on? Mom is no more with us and all of you have ended up fighting. Did you ever stop to think how she might want to be cremated? What kind of cremation she would have liked? Hello, this wasn't a birthday party where you get a choice of themes. It wasn't a birthday but a deathday. Birthdays come every year. Death comes once. But no one stopped to think what she might have liked. Really? How does that matter? She's gone. How can she like or not like anything? Perhaps she might want a say in what she might like to be freed from? How she would like to be remembered? How will her soul be freed if she is truly floating above us here? But that's the whole point of the rituals! To set the soul on the path to. We do things without knowing why we do them. We do them mechanically so that PP Uncle will approve. We do them so people will say how well everything went off. That we crossed every t and dotted every i. No one spared a thought for mom. Say something! These traditions have been with us for thousands of years. And just because you don't believe, doesn't mean they're wrong. I know how Mom wanted her last rites to be! God! Papa, you can move the seat back and stretch out a bit. -I'm fine. -You will-- If he's fine, leave it. -Hi, baby. -Hello. -Hello. -Hi, baby. How are you? All okay? -Is everything alright there? You okay? -Wait. Listen. -Yeah. -No. -Wait. -First you listen to me. Don't get mad at anyone, okay? Are you listening? Yeah! And most importantly -be very patient with papa. -Mudassar. Be very patient with Papa. -I know, Mudassar. -You'll lose and then he'll also lose it. -You need to stay in control. -Fine. Listen. -He needs you right now. -You are on speaker. Hi… Hello everyone. Hello, Papa. Hello. Hello. Greetings. So you guys carry on. I'll… call you later. -I'll text you later. -Yeah. I love you. -Shut up. Bye. -Bye! Not a word. Open the boot. Tara. This… This is PP's list. Yes. Take a look. It's all there. Don't worry. I'll make sure it all gets done. -No, let me keep that. -Are you sure? -Yeah. -Get on with it, guys. Daisy, one second. Sir, let me get you a room? -I don't need any. -Come with me, sir. -No thanks. I don't need anything. -I'll get you a hotel. Right now. -Someone get this kid off me. -Come, please. -I don't want a hotel. -We'll do it. -We'll do it. -Let me get you a hotel. Right now. -This bag? -It's mine. -Come with me, please. -Son, I don't need a hotel. -Ma'am, a hundred dollars, please? -Hundred dollars. Hey, do you know how much money that is? One second, guys. Sandalwood might help you calm down, sir. I'm cool. Put it on him. -A hundred rupees-- -Sandalwood cools… -It's nice. -I don't want any. Come on, Karan. -It's done. -Babe, just give them something. Ma'am, a hundred dollars, please. Please give them some money. Let me apply this. The chakra is right here. Got it? The chakra is right here. -Right here. -Here. Bless you. Bless you. Come. May you live long. Tara, touch his feet. You do it. -Hey. -I touch your feet. How are you? Touch Granddad's feet. No, Papa. I don't like it. Everything isn't about liking or disliking. This is respect. I don't have to touch people's feet to show respect. Bless me. What's your problem? Just touch his feet. I don't want to touch his feet. At least do it for papa. You go about pleasing people, okay? Who was by Granddad's side when he was ill? -Me, right? -He's always falling sick. -So, you-- -Shut up! Stupid child. She talks a lot. Our daughters… don't touch… their elders' feet. See? Daughters-in-law must do it! And when you become one… you'll have to touch their feet. -Granddad, I-- -Enough! Silent mode. Whose ashes are being immersed? Gayatri Bhalla. And she liked none of this. Liked none of this? Do you know why we immerse ashes in River Ganga? Would you like to know? Yes, please. There are many stories about this… but my favorite is the one about the Queen of Hastinapur. I've got my laptop with me so I can show you. My password is… "Don't Remember." With a capital D. Can you see? When King Shantanu of Hastinapur saw a beautiful woman by the banks of the Ganga, he offered marriage. The queen accepted with a condition. He was never to question any of her actions. Or she would leave him, forever. Now, all together, Hail Mother Ganga. Hail Mother Ganga. When the queen gave birth to a son, she took him to the river. The king was following her and he watched… as she sacrificed… the baby to the river. The king could say nothing. He had promised. Now all together, hail Mother Ganga. Hail Mother Ganga. She did this with the second child as well, offering him to Mother Ganga. Then the third, and the fourth. The fifth and the sixth and the seventh as well. All of them were sacrificed to Mother Ganga. The entire kingdom was horrified at this. But the king could ask no questions. Then came the eighth child… Buffering… The queen took the eighth baby to the river. This time the king could bear it no longer. She reminded him of his promise but he could not contain himself. Now all together, hail Mother Ganga. -Hail Mother Ganga. -Hail Mother Ganga. Then the queen explained that… she was a daughter of Lord Brahma and that the Sage Vashishta had cursed her so that all her children would be born in the human world. The only way for them to be freed from this world and attain the heaven would be for them to be offered to Mother Ganga. And so we also immerse the ashes of the dead in Mother Ganga so that she will wash away any sins the dead person may have committed. -Hail Mother Ganga. -Excuse me. I think we immerse the ashes because ashes have phosphates which are good for agriculture. Tara, sit down. Karan, what do you mean? I can't take this nonsense anymore. This is blind faith. It's all science and nothing else. -Just sit down. -I'm not going to be sitting through-- Greetings. Sorry. Please continue. She doesn't understand. Do you know who the eighth child was? Bhishma Pitamaha, the supreme commander of the Kaurava force in the Mahabharata. What was her name? Tara… Tara Bhalla. Come this way. It's a longer route but easier. You're right. It's all science. But your story was boring. It does nothing to help the grieving. It has no action or a climax. Nor have you come so far to nourish Mother Ganga with your mother's ashes. These stories nourish the world. Stories are older than us, and also the dinosaurs. It's older than the world. You hear a story and you tell your children your version of it. But many of these stories and the beliefs they spawn are damaging. That's because we do not try to understand them. -Greetings, sir. -Bless you. We do not humble ourselves when we touch another's feet. We touch them to receive blessings. The energy from the hand goes straight to your pituitary gland. Come. -Tara, come along, don't argue. -Come, this way. Thank you. Thank you for letting us pass. Come. Take this. -Do you mind giving blessings? -No, please don't. -Bless me. -Don't! Kid, that energy has reached your pituitary! Give that to him. What would you like to remember about Ms. Gayatri? It's the little things, right? Or is there some science behind that? You will remember-- Sir. -You will remember all the -This is for you. little things she said or did. Listen, Ms. Gayatri has been here many times. -What? -Yes. But in this lifetime she left you those stories, those memories. Tara was right. I forgot to talk to you. These rituals kept me… so busy. I forgot the important things. Why were you in a hurry? We were chugging along so well together. You were fifteen years younger than me. So I was sure… I would go first. Then… When I said you would have to push me about in a wheelchair… I… I was joking. It was a… it was a joke. If you went away for a weekend, you would leave a list of things for me to do. Now… what am I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't know. And our bet about Mudassar and Tara getting married… how will you know who won? How? I think they will. There's a half-bottle of your shampoo… in the bathroom. It's there. What am I-- Okay, I'll give it to Delna. How will I get to eat your famous rice gruel? In the market? And Nakul. Nakul doesn't even know. If I had gone first, you would have known how to tell him. How do I tell him? You remember those… promises we made at the wedding? That we would be together… for this lifetime and many more? Is that promise… valid or not? I need you to come back, please. Please. Now I have no idea what to do. I'm so lost. Was this the way you wanted to go? Did we do good? And I knew you used to smoke. I… My love is the night sky My love is the night and the sky I want to spend my life with you My love As the light takes dawn by the hand And spreads across the land I want to spend my life with you My love Are those lips or a flower in bloom My dreams hover around them Around my love My love My tongue is tied My lips are silent My eyes complain to my heart What you do to me, my love! As the earth longs for rain I long for my love I want to spend my life with you My love My life takes all its meaning When I see it in your eyes I know who I am in The mirror of your eyes Each of your charms Works like magic I will lose myself In this magic I've lost my heart It's gone My love, you've got it And now you're gone So once you're done with this, they'll break it and give you tender coconut to eat. What's tender coconut? -It's like creamy-- -Will you have some chole bhature? Chole bhature anyone? Greetings, sir. The chole here are famous. Come here. -Do you want to eat some? -No. Are you nuts? Come, Mr. Harish. Let's eat. -No thank you. -Everyone's probably hungry. No, Papa. Let's go back to the hotel and eat something simple. Sir… Mr. Harish, you won't get any better. You cannot go without eating them. And it's not as if you're going to come here again and again. And if you eat well, I'm sure Ms. Gayatri would find peace. Good food cures many heartaches. -Well, if we must, we must. -Yes. -Where do these come from? -Come this way. Only if you insist. -Okay. Really? -Papa wants to have it. Come on. We never know when life will come to an end. So you might as well eat chole bhature and be merry. Here you go. Have it. -Lime. -Lime. -And some more chole. -Okay. Give me some lime. -Baby, are you okay? -Yes. It's spicy. Don't eat that. The phosphates in the Ganga have given these chills their zing. You were right. It took me some time to understand it… but what we do not understand is not necessarily wrong. Give me some chole. Give me some chole. Praise Lord Krishna Praise Lord Krishna Praise Lord Rama Praise Lord Rama Praise Lord Krishna Praise Lord Krishna Praise Lord Rama Praise Lord Rama Do you play the ukulele? Yes. Praise Lord Krishna Praise Lord Rama Where did you learn? On my own. What? I learned to play on my own. Praise Lord Krishna When you play the tune and then learn how it was created, that's faith, it's God-sent. Praise Lord Krishna When you learn how to create the tune and then play it, that's science. Praise Lord Rama But eventually, it's the same tune. Praise Lord Krishna Praise Lord Rama Praise Lord Rama Mr. Harish, come this way. Come. Take off your shoes. Remove your sandals. Greetings. Greetings, sir. The eldest must offer his hair. -What? -Who is the eldest? -He is. -He is. What do I have to do? Sir, will he have to shave his head? Purification requires him to go bald. -Yes. -I left my phone behind. I have your phone. This is a very long line. No. We shouldn't break the queue. I'll be back. That's a different line. That line is not to be crossed. Please sit down for a while. -Where are you taking him? -I'm coming. Sit down here. Come away from the crowd. I'll check what's happening. Papa, sit down. I'll handle everything. Hi, sir! Listen to what I am saying. Guys, can I just… -Sir. -Yes? We did whatever you said, right? Yes. And we did it well? You are still doing it. Is this necessary? It is a purification rite. She was your mother. How is her soul to find peace? Shaving my head will bring her peace? It's not a haircut. It's a sacrifice. Do you know what that means? Do you understand what blind faith means? Same question. No, I'm not having my hair cut. I am not going to do this just to make you happy. -Let me tell you right now-- -What happened, Mr Obedient? Changed your rules? So we listen to whatever he says? Are we so dumb? We are educated people, right? Whatever he says… and he may say anything… Look, Tara. Listen up, everyone. Guys, we are an emotional bunch. I'm emotional as well. We are an emotional bunch. And you're taking advantage of that. That's what he's doing. He's taking advantage of the fact that we're emotional. Listen to me. It's really simple. There's a scientific basis to this as well. Cutting the hair reduces the ego. -What? -Never mind. Listen. Everyone here is sacrificing their hair because they want to. They're doing it with good hearts. And I am only a messenger of the Gods. I can only show you the road. I don't want to walk that road. All this is based on faith. And what is faith? Tara, there's no such thing as faith. It's a farce, Tara. It's a farce. Hey… Wow! Do I have to prove how much I loved my mother? Must I present evidence? No. -Sir. -Yes? Is it possible if he can cut just a little bit? What? No! Excuse me. Taru, listen to me. I have a meeting in LA. Sweetheart-- Can I walk into a board meeting bald? Stop crying. I'm not crying. Stop stressing. My God! -Sir. -Yes? Is there any other way? There is. There is a way out. Listen. Yes? Girdhar can help you with this one. Who is that? Girdhar… come over here, please. Girdhar! Please come here. Please come here, Girdhar. -Girdhar. -Girdhar. Girdhar is here. This… Hello. He will be shave his head in your place to please the Gods. Is that okay? Oh yes, indeed. Gayatri was his mother as well. A mother is a mother. Was she not? -She was. -See. Now, you'll have to feed him. He will have kachori puri. Thank you. I will have jalebi today. Listen. Give this to Shastri. I hope this won't upset the Gods. No. God belongs to all of us. He is no stranger. He understands the pressure of a board meeting. And now it is time for me to leave. May I take your leave? Blessings on all of you. And your fees? I have already been paid. I brought them with me when I came. -Hail the God! -Praise the Lord! Defeater of death -Scourge of -What are they singing? -The unjust -I don't know… -but it sounds good… -Blue-throated one -I guess that's what matters. -Giver of the nectar of life Hail God of all time and God out of time Awe-inspiring Lord Shankar You are life, you are death -You are the chain, you are the links -Are you serious -You protect every living form -about Mudassar? -Awe-inspiring Lord Shankar -Come and meet him. Get to know him… and then decide. You are life, you are death You are the chain, you are the links What if I disapprove him? You protect every living form Will be thrown out. Hail God of all time and God out of time Me or him? Hail God of all time and God out of time You live together? When did that begin? We haven't talked properly in ages. Don't you think? Hail God of all time and God out of time Hail God of all time and God out of time Come. -Is there a patient here? -Come this way. Gayatri Bhalla. Here. Mom, what happened? She fell in the bathroom. She hurt her head but she'll be fine… I think. Is it bad? Where is she hurt? What did the doctors say? I can smell alcohol right over here. They had a farewell party. Leave it. Let it be, bro. I don't need to explain to anybody. Yes, we are grown-ups now, we don't need to explain ourselves. Excuse me. She's fine but we'll need O negative replacement. Yeah. -I am O Negative. -Just shut up. -Why should I shut up? -I will-- Tara, you've been drinking. Let me call someone and ask. Stop this nonsense. Doctor, I'll handle this. What do you mean? Tara, don't talk like that to Papa. Why do I always have to bear the taunts? What's your problem? Let it go. Let what go? Tara, watch it. Mom is sleeping. Just shut up. You shut up. You're the family's golden boy, right? The class topper! Get out of here, both of you. I mean it. We'll get some peace at least. Come on. Go. -I get scolded because of you. -Whatever. I'm not dying to stay here either! I am out and how! Wow! Very nice! I'm still around. You'll have to wait a bit. -Where are you going? What's going on? -Over there. -Over there. Where is sir? -He is there. Okay, great. Be careful. Didn't you offer your hair? Despite me telling him, he didn't shave his head. It's all about style. Is this the complete menu? Karan didn't have his head shaved? Yes, we'll sort that out. -So we will-- -For peace in the family. Why not have a cup of tea? I'm talking to him. So let's look at this list-- I can only advise and leave it at that. There's kadhai paneer and matar paneer. Let's do it this way. Just make it matar paneer with dal. Harish, one second. You know on the thirteenth day after the death-- -I was just-- -I'm talking, PP. We'd like a pulao and some rotis. Sir… We'd like papads and raita along. Oh, no! -All good, sir. -I'll be back. I'll give you a pakora curry to go with. It's one of our specials. I will add this to the menu. -You cut it properly. -That comes up to 1, 650 per person. 1,650 rupees. That's what you charged me for Karan's wedding. -The same rate for the-- -It was… How can you charge the same rate? -It's still food, sir. -Call me. How does it matter? Is that done? Okay. Angad. -Yes? One second. -Please look into this. -Come, Daisy. -But, sir-- Sit… please sit. Have you been watering these plants? -Yes, I did that earlier this morning. -Great. What about this one? I'm thinking of reshaping it. You said she would… live to be ninety. That it was all written on the lines of her hand. Yes, child. Now… I did say that, son. Every parent wants… their child to live to be a hundred. That's what I wanted. That's what I wanted. My child, are you all right? Sir, in our culture, we have ceremonies on the 13th day after someone passes. It's a ritual. Yes. I'll finish this and I'll wrap it up and come soon. Thank you, sir. Wrap it up again? Yes, thank you, sir. -Yes, see you, sir. -For God's sake, Karan! I know, baby, but I have fifty thousand calls to make now. Everyone's waiting for me. I can't just leave them hanging. -I have work to do. -Why? -You're saying I shouldn't work?! -Yes. -I shouldn't earn? -Just do your thing. -Ma'am! -Wonderful! Ms. Gayatri! Yes, what is it? Hi, this is Karan. Can you connect me again, please? -Mr. Karan! -Yes? When did you get here? Hello. And where is Ms. Gayatri? Yeah, hold. Mom! Mom! Come on down. I won't make it too spicy. Mom. Quick! Quick! Oh, God! Give it to him now. -What happened? -Mom. It's too spicy. How many times do I have to tell you to not make spicy ones for him? Keep it mild. Don't you listen? He cries anyway. Come on, get away from here. Show it to me. The spice went into my eyes. Okay, don't touch it. Show it to me. Make it spicier. It's sticking in my braces. I told you I don't want braces. -They tease me in school. -Show me. Memories come in a flood My beloved mother Mom! My beloved mother My beloved mother Mom won't ever come back. Stupid. Have you seen Mom's phone anywhere? Kite? I was looking for Mom's phone. Had she kept this safely? Why? Was it special? Turn it over. Now she's here, now she's there Oh, she's everywhere Hold her down? She's light as air How she harasses me Such noise as she talks to boys Her heart is a kite in flight Try controlling it You're left with string Your love is a kite, in a cat-fight Tease it, ease it to you Tie your kite Tie it tight Let it take flight Tie your kite Tie it tight Let it take flight Tie your kite Tie it tight Let it take flight Tie your kite Tie it tight Let it take flight What? What are you saying? G for Geeta and not Gayatri? Yes, Gayatri was out of my league. That means you wanted to marry Auntie Geeta? And you married Mom? Look at it this way. I wanted to get married. Gayatri was the favorite, not just of the colony but all of Chandigarh. And the most beautiful. I couldn't even dream of her. It was my good luck that your Auntie liked me for her sister. That means, you didn't win Mom's hand, Auntie won it for you. Tie your kite Tie it tight Oh, yes! Tie your kite Tie it tight Go for it! Tie your kite Tie it tight Does she know? No. That was my secret. Now it's our secret. Anyway, Mom was too pretty for you. Do you agree? But no one could've loved her like you. I didn't even take her last call. I didn't get a chance to speak to her for the last time. I couldn't even tell her I won the case. And when were you planning to tell me? Buddy, can I charge my phone? I have to book an Uber. -Go right ahead. -Thank you. We regret for the inconvenience caused to the passengers. We welcome all the passengers. Passengers, please pay attention. The train number… -Surprise! -Surprise! -Surprise! -Happy birthday. -Happy birthday from Gayatri! -Happy birthday from Gayatri! -Surprise! -Oh! -Happy birthday. -Happy birthday! H-A-P-P-Y!

What's with Mom? Papa messaged that she's not well. Everything all right? Come home. We'll talk. Hey, the party crashers should be there for Papa's party. Mom and I had planned the surprise. Glad they were on time. Awesome! Listen, my train is late but I'm catching a cab. Don't tell Papa I'm coming. It's a surprise. Yeah. H-A-P-P-Y! It's your birthday! H-A-P-P-Y! It's your birthday!

Karan and his Daisy. And Auntie as well. One second. Sorry Papa, my train was late. But happy birthday, Papa. I'm so sorry, Papa. Happy birthday. Brother Angad! So good to see you. Mom and I had a bet going on you and look everyone's here. I won a thousand bucks. Where's she? Now time to meet Mom. Where my Mom? Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Where is my Mom? Where is my Mom? Mom wasn't well, you know… What are you saying? My beloved mother My beloved mother Mom! My beloved mother Mom! My beloved mother -Memories come in a flood -What are you saying? -My beloved mother -Leave me. How can you be saying that? Is this a joke? -Papa, this is a joke, right? -My beloved mother My beloved mother Papa… This is my fault. How can I be so irresponsible? How can I be so irresponsible? You did nothing wrong, Nakul. No one did. Gayatri was fine. She went happily. -No… -Papa. But Papa… No ifs and buts. Can you sit around waiting for us to die? It doesn't work that way. Come on now, stop crying. Come on. Did you climb that mountain? Did you make it to the top? Good, show me. I did it for Mom. She challenged me. She said… "You climb these little hills. Go climb something challenging." And when I did it, she isn't here, Papa. No, she isn't. How can God be so unfair, Papa? Hey… You know… when my mother and father left me at school for the last time… then… Bye. Then they turned right and never came back. Every day, I stood there waiting for them. What is it? They're saying my parents are dead. What does that mean? Harish, can you see that man on the cycle there? Can you see him now? The teacher said, "He's taken the right turn and you can't see him anymore. But that doesn't mean he isn't there." Mom took a right-turn as well. She moves on… but we can't see her. And then one day, it will be our turn to take that right-turn. We won't be seen… but we'll still be moving on. Hey. Stupid must have taken a right turn somewhere. That's how he ended up here, with us. Check your phone. Mom! "Papa's 70th birthday. Everyone come on over. Let's surprise him." She may have taken a right-turn but she's not stopped chasing us. Defeater of death Scourge of the unjust Blue-throated one Giver of the nectar of life Great Lord Shiva Giver of Immortality, uniter of all Great God of all Gods, we bow to you Defeater of death, scourge of evil We surrender to you in our hour of need Nakul, it's been a long time. Mr. Ajit. Cut it all off. All of it? All of it. You never allowed me to touch your hair. When you tonsured me as a child, remember what you said? Remember? Cutting the hair brings purity. Deflects the evil eye. You will become brainy. You'll walk on your own. You won't have to hold your mom's hand. When your hair grows back, you'll look like Shah Rukh Khan. Now's your chance to cut it. As you wish. How are you, Mr. Ajit? Karan, how are you? Great. And you? I'll be with you in a minute. They say there's science in this one as well. One's hair is a symbol of one's ego. Once you get rid of the ego… that's when you can take on new responsibilities. Shall we do away with this ego?

Why can't you cook?" And the wife said, "You watch Kaun Banega Crorepati? as well. Why aren't you a millionaire?" I think we should discuss this right-turn phenomenon right now. It might be a good idea for us to know how everyone else wants to make their exit. -Absolutely. -We can avoid confusion. Exactly. Yeah. You'd better tell us what you'd like because Karan and I are never going to agree. Yeah. Last year, I had a heart attack and I thought it was my time to take a right turn. But it turned out to be a U-turn. -It was-- -I made something and brought it along. It's a little surprise. -Oh, wow… for me? -Yes! Very nice. -Papa. -Yes? I could take my right turn before you, right? What are you saying, son? -My right turn… -Yes? could be before you, right? Actually, you're right. When you got to leave the world… you got to go. Get it? It's very nice. I love it. It's ridiculous. It's very nice. They don't know anything. If you can join the sides, it would be… -Join! -Join! Auntie, it's called fashion! It's not your cup of tea. Let me show her. Shut up, all of you! -Why don't you teach her? -Don't worry. It's really nice.
