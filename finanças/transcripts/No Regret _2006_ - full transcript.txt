See you tomorrow. Bye bye, Mr. chauffeur. Hello... Came home early? You? Another driving service? Aren't you tired? I got more because he vomited in the car. Eww, fucking pigs. Why don't they drink less? I know you're into studying and side jobs but pay some attention at the plant. Didn't you hear about the lay-offs? You've been working for a year now. Why so cranky? No hot chic tonight? Hey, Su-min. What? Are my hands that chapped? Why do you ask? I met with a gostosinha recently. Well, it was going great. And then guess what she said. "Honey, why your hands are so chapped?" So? So I said "Cause my hands play golf. On that note, I see your face plays golf to." Stop laughing, fucker. It's a shame... Even with braces, I get so many girls. Why? because I'm cool. Oh, fucking handsome... Girls are such a big attraction to you? Yup, You still go after guys? Everyone knews the orphanage. Hwan-sun is a blabbermouth, you know. This is because you've never been with a girl OK, I'll help. Let's visit a brothel. By the way, have you ever fucked a guy? Trust me, man! Underdogs like us need family. Dude, I'm hungry. Gonna have Ramen. Hello? Sir, did you call for the driving service? It's in the parking lot. Space 3524. Sorry? I beg your pardon? Thank you, sir. Play some music, please. Sorry to bother you. I thought I had money in my wallet. No problem. Thank you. Are... you busy now? I'm gonna have another drink Why don't you join? I have work. Actually... I had money in my wallet. What's your name? Are you sick? What happened? Damn it! It's so stuffy in here! Poor Kwang-soo... His daughter's preparing for college. You can say that again. Shit! What about our overtime work? Fuck it all! So I've always been proposing a union! With girls at the nightclub? Hey! What happened? You're fired, too? Assholes treat non-regulars like shit. 20 men at once! Kill'em all... Good morning. Good morning. You bastards! Fucking irritating! What? You know him? Head of personnel department? He's the CEO's son. Useless bastard! Don't tell anybody. Jong-ho at #2 was fired instead of you. You got fired but he pulled some strings and he saved your ass. You can't go in... Had no idea you were working here. If I had known before... I'm sorry. It's a bit messy... You... quit the driving service, didn't you? I called you again... I appreciate your kindness... But you try to wear it you bastard. Come on, Su-min. If you quit like this you lose unemployment. Where are you going? Hwan-sun, it's me... Have any openings for me? Pretty good money here. Look, he earned $8,000 last month. That's how you feel proud. Wear something while you sleep, bitch. Naughty! Does... Hwan-sun know? Nope, He just thinks it's karaoke. Would you brag about working here? Money is the root of all evil. If you're reluctant, just don't. Go wash the dishes or something. People are waiting in the line. Fuck! Who's that? Another runaway? He'll be back. That bitch is an orphan. Had to leave the orphanage at 18. Where would he go? Whew... So hot. How was it? What? Not good? How many times? Sleeping here again? Still being stubborn. How much can you earn washing dishes? Here... Chicken soup. A little later. You should've stayed at the factory. You're not even going to class lately. Have to work nights. You just not good at dishwashing. Did he say I could work till the week? I apologize. I'll take care of it right away. It's you who washed this? They were stains! Would you eat from a plate this dirty? Use your eyes when your washing dishes. Hwan-sun, come see me later. Damn germaphobes. Use your eyes for dishwashing? Do her eyes spray soap, huh? Hello? Oh, my dear son! Did you? Hold on a second. Well, I don't hire fags. regular customers here don't like fags, either. I'm a fag. And I hate ambiguity. Whose side are you on? Don't tell Hwan-sun. Thank you. I'll be right back. Gays do not last long here. Some of them runaway with customers. We're here just to make money. Damn it! I never let them fuck my ass, though. How was your first service? Don't tell me it was anal. Why are you doing this? Why? My mother has cancer ... and I'm the only one who can work. Really? Moron! You believed that? My mom died years ago. Heard you're from orphanage. I'm from a home for juvenile delinquents. Madame is calling. Customers are waiting. Come on. I'll find some fucking homo bastard and I will suck every last drop of blood. Buy a sports car and other flashy shit. My prostitution is all for my baby. What about you? No girlfriend. Not that... Why are you doing this? Money. Yes money. I'll suck yours if you pay me. Let's go make money... Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! My father got in a car accident. Second round, right? I think I'm falling in love with you. You can always come see me at the bar. Listen. Why are you so mad at me? I told him to go... But he came back on his own. Filthy bastard! Did I tell you to do this? Is this why we came to Seoul? Fucking orphans! Bunch of idiots! Asshole! I changed your diapers, and I even stole for you when you got sick. And this is what I get? You jerk. Stands firm... Very tough... I'll be filthy rich and go to college. I'll be like him, Mr. God's Gift. Give me a second. I need to spend just a moment. Just a second. Fuck! Damn it! Thats enough. Fuck! Those bastards deserve it. Take off my clothes without paying? Shit! We'll bury these sons of bitches. What happened? Dirty pigs! They wanted threesome. Would you do that shit? Why not? Why didn't you? Moron! Nobody will invite you anyway. Fuck! What if he finds out? I don't give a shit. I've got to buy some present for Sun-mi. It's her birthday next week. Hey, hey! Customers have arrived. Get ready! Jae-woo, move your ass. Spit it out, bitch! Hurry up! Who's next? How would I know he's not going to fuck me? You find out. He dresses well though. Hey Hey, Hurry! You bitches all move your asses Now, in order. #3, Su-min. Fuck it. #3 is for me. Fuck you, bitch. Jesus, what's eating Madame, today? Must be on his period. His ex made a scene here yesterday. And called the court for custody of his son. Being gay and the father is out of fashion. Wait! #1's for me. Hey, the bet's on. $17 to win. Hello. Hyun-min, #1. Hi. I am Jung-tae, #2. Su-min, #3. Kang, #4. What do you think, sir? It's a great selection. Which number are you gonna choose, sir? Or do you want to take a look at some others? No. What's gotten into you? Hey! Hey, look! Are you crazy? Want to ruin my business? Damn cheeky bitch! Think I'm gonna explode. I'll wait outside. No anal. Are you hard? I wish your cock was a gun. And I wish I could shoot it inside me. You are disgusting. You've been disgusting from the beginning. If you come see me again, I'll kill you. Not for sale? hmm ... very good. - Thank you. - Gorgeous... It makes you look taller Jae-min! Excuse me... Would you happen to... be a singer? Here, try this on. Give it back later. Thank you. Dude, where have you been staying? In a sauna, for now. Your look screams that you should end up living in a sauna. Jesus, Madame is so sour lately. You can stay with me for a while. Really? Only a few days. Thank you. How touching! Yes, the orphans have to help each other. Bitches, you never know what to suck. Stop sucking that, bitches! Client! Mr. Kim is here. Hurry up. You, check your pants. Gee... Su-min, again? And him? Is he a charity case from Shilim Avenue? Take off the glasses and get dressed. What's this? What? A cow? A dog? Hey, leave it alone. Now, hurry up! Yes, ma'am. Do I look like someone from Avenue Shilim? Fucking moron! That's rare. Give it to me. Oh, no thanks. Gimme. Thank you. Come on. Where are you going with all these clients? Fuck it! Are the guys at the bar clients? Hey! What? It's my girlfriend's birthday. OK, you're the boss, bitch! I love the citylights in Seoul. Someday I'll go everywhere. I'm going to set Seoul on fire. What? You don't think it's fabulous place? In Seoul... You can't trust anyone. Why not? Why did you come to Seoul? To make money. There's nothing to do in the country. Because people like us have nothing. So why are you being so kind to me? You remind me of someone... Who? Su-min, let's get something to eat. I'm starving... It'll be on me. I owe you one. Sausages and fish soup! Yummy! Damn. I haven't heard from you in ages. Hwan-sun called you, right? He always freaks over everything. It hurts a little. But the hospital is letting me out soon. How will you play golf with a broken arm? Shit! I can't even jerk off. Damn! I prefer type B. You look good even with a broken arm. Oh yeah? I know I'm beautiful, I know. You look good. What are you up to these days? Even Hwan-sun doesn't tell me. You look good, though. Did he call you? Who? You know, the chief of staff? The day you quit... And? He kept asking me where you were. So I said you'd gone to Hwan-sun's. He said he wanted to apologize to you. I heard he caused a scene at Hwan-sun's. To find out where you were. Looked everywhere to find you. A fancy guy... with balls. Does he think he's a detective or something? Do you have some score to settle with him? Did he ever find you? Hey, remember the bitch he gave the dog balloon to? She ran away with his entire savings. He even took responsibility for her depts. What will he do now? If he asks you to lend him money You just say NO. He will drag you down with him. Hey... Su-min, I'm fucked. I have nothing. Lend me some money, I need food. Welcome! Welcome! Let go! Excuse me, sir. What's the matter? What? Today $8,000? Am I just a customer to you? Fucker! Yes, I'm crazy for money. You know what that is? I told you not to come back, didn't l? Once... just once. Can't you see me as a man and not money? Why are you chasing after me? We still hven't introduce ourselves. I'm in pain since I met you. Why? Because you fell for a prostitute? Because you're gay? Why keep ignoring my heart? So corny. You're rich and well-educated. Can't you find something brilliant to say? Let go. I can't figure it out, but I just like you. You don't even know my name yet. Sorry to interrupt you but don't call me any more. This is the last free service, Sir. I won't see you again for all the money in the world. You can run and hide all you want but I can't afford to have fun with you. Forget about me. Nice to meet you, Su-min. I think the Chief of Police is completely crazy about me. He said he was going to buy me a car last night. Yeah? Yes, I really wanted a car. I'll drive to every corner of Seoul. Let's go away for a few days. Boy, save a little. You'll blow it all. Can you pay for college like that? College? Our Father at the orphanage told me that I could never go to college, So I always would read encyclopedias. Well... Su-min... Don't you feel anything when your with a guy? What? I think I have someone in mind. I haven't heard anything. Madame doesn't like it, man. Then it can't go on like this. What about you? That rumor is everywhere. Who is he? Cut it out! Phew... Must be in real love, huh? You wanna go to? Go. Oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Hey, relaxe bitches. Can't you be on time? Give me. I'll take care of it. Don't try to butter me up. Next time you're late, Oh, Su-min! Yes. Come here. What? Your stalker was been here. Came in right before opening. A tough bitch! I did like you said. I told him you left Seoul and he just gave me this. Are you messing around with him? Behave yourself! Jae-min Song, Is he rich? It's good your rid of him. Get real, sucker! My sister got us tickets to Europe. With Prague included. You wanted go there to, didn't you? So, did you choose one? Oh, I like this. A reasonable price as well. How beautiful! But isn't it too expensive? Not at all. He's my only son. Oh, his father would ask for more. Though he's strict, he loves his son. Hey, Jae-min, what do you think of this? Choose one you like. I'm going back to office. Did you have a fight? Send him, please. From X-Large... Want me naked? No... There once was a shy man who fell in love with a poor man. But the poor man wouldn't take his heart. What am I supposed to do? Give it up. How about this? Found something brilliant to say? Yeah. Why should your cock be more special then all the other cocks I suck every night? Because mine is alone... Yours is also alone. Su-min! Su-min! Su-min LEE! Su-min LEE! Su-min! Where's Su-min? Su-min!

What's back there? Because I like you, sir. I'll offer you the installment plan. I'll have to make a lot of money, then. Aren't you working too hard? I think so. Surfed the net all day long. To travel in Europe with you. Let's go to Prague. Stop. Stop... Just a second. - I might be late. Seriously... late... - Come on. Wait outside. - Jae-min. - Wait outside! It won't work. Too old. How could you go without TV? Everything OK? What? Oh, my mom? She's knew I was gay for years. Having no parents is good in this case. When I'm with you, I feel strong. Yes... Nice car... I'm jealous. I took a week off. I'll drive all around Seoul. I wanted to go with you. He's up there, right? You seem happy. The only guy I liked... He... He lives in a small room on the roof. I hope I can make you happy too. I'll also think of you every morning when my dick gets hard. Congratulations. Hey, Mr. Song. Congratulate you. Yeah... Good morning. Congratulations, Jae-min. What's this? I'm not ignorant I understand sexuality. I don't care if you fuck a man or not. You can't get him pregnant anyway. But, you will marry her. Why do you have to do this? I have to leave soon. We'll talk later. Go to your father's office. He knows, too. Not just your father. I'll tell everyone. I'll have my way. Father. Jae-min's not in right now... Who are you? Who are you? Me? It hurts. Yes... I played dirty, right? Disgusting. Yeah, I've been disgusting from the beginning. But... I love you. Then, what's our relationship? Because I'm uneducated? I'll study hard. Is it because I'm dirty? I'll be faithful to you. Is it because I'm poor? I'll work hard. What do you want? What do I mean to you? Jae-min, Please don't hang up. Just a second. I'll wait here until you come down. Hello? Yes. Damn! This orphan didn't even have a wake. Back to Seoul. Fuck... God damn it. Son of a bitch! Learn to drive, damn it! Stop crying! Assholes. Everything's fucking illegal. Where do we spread them then? The guy who bought Ga-ram the car was... a police officer, right? Fuckers! We should kill them all. I want to work there again. Why come back, bastard? Why? Fucking opportunists... Gave him your body and soul, your crazy Damn! What an old fashioned love story! Look, he will come back to you 100 pounds heavier after getting married. Don't say like that. Fuck you man! You saw what happened to our friend Ga-ram? And what about me? Don't you see this? Those loan sharks drive me crazy. Fuck! I should've beaten him to death. And took all his money. It's no different from the bitch who ran away with all the money I had. Fuck! If you say yes, I'll... You'll what? Don't you know what should be done to vampires? You and I could... Let me out. If you just say you want to... Stop the car! Shit! Ga-ram, Why did we come to this place?

Don't worry about it, OK? Did you think about the car? Jae-min. Jae-min! By the way is it true the leader of Republican party is coming? It's only fair for him to come. With all I've done for him, huh? I should've heard it earlier. I could have asked him officially. I'm sorry... The man we just passed, Jae-min! He is the one I love. I'm Sorry. Your so selfish. Thanks. Su-min! Su-min! It's me. I can't come in to the office, tomorrow. ...Su-min? ...Su-min? That was part one. I hope it was not too boring. Inside the studio is quite warm. But it seems windy outside. We expected to have the first snow of the season. Dress warm if you're going out. Now comes the 2nd part with new songs. Stand tall. We've come to far to go back.

What are you looking at, bastard? Hallelujah! What a show! Fucking shit! Fucking stupid! That's enough! What a big hole! I'm sure he hasn't done military service thanks to his rich father. Look at him. He's like a snake. Come here baby. Heaven's waiting for you. Shit! Come quick! Come this way, you mother fucker! Want a cigarette before you die? No, Better not. Smoking is bad for your health. Money doesn't grow on trees, you know. It grows in the ground on a dead man. If you meet God there ask for a loan for me. No, that I fucking thank him, OK? Amen! This guy needs a deeper hole. If I didn't have back pains you would be dead already. Stop. I said stop! Are you crazy? Damn! What's wrong? Just stop that. I can't do this. Take the money. Fuck! Get out, fucker! Hell with fucking faggot sentiment. Son of a bitch! Damn! Just take the money! I don't want it. I didn't do this for the money. He's not gonna call the police. Just go. Damn... Beautiful sight! Yeah, If you love him so much I'll bury you with him. Fuck! Why are we so miserable? I'm Sorry. Nice to meet you, Jae-min.
