No. You gotta get out now! I can't do this anymore. I will not let her see you like this. - You need help! - I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. - You're always sorry. - Come on. How am I supposed to believe you? - Every time! - You've been trying... Do you know how many times you've promised you would stop? - This is not my fault. - Not your fault? You're drunk. In the middle of the day. - Of course they fired you. - Can we please talk about this? - You don't give a shit about us. - Please. - You have to go. - Don't do this. Get out and don't come back till you're sober. Daddy? Daddy! Daddy, don't go! No! No, no, no. Dad, please! No, don't go. - Please don't go, please! - Tessa! Tessa! Please, Daddy. Don't go. Daddy, please don't go. Daddy! No! I can't tell you how good it is to see you again, Tessie. There's towels in the bathroom, if you want to take a shower. - I'll make us some food. - Thanks. This is good. I remember you were quite the cook, Tessie. - Thanks. - Just like your mom. I tried to call you, you know. Sent you gifts every birthday, Christmas. She didn't tell you, did she? No. Yeah. So the prodigal father has returned. What for? What do you want? You can stay, if... If you want to. We have room, and I don't want you out on the street. - Are you still drinking? - Can you excuse us for a second? I know that this isn't the most convenient, but you, of all people, should appreciate me - giving him a second chance. - Me, of all people, would know that he's probably out there right now shoving all of our shit into his pockets. He's gonna hurt you. - You don't know him. - Neither do you. It's been, what, 10 years since you last saw him? Nine. Look, I'm just trying to protect you. I don't need you to protect me. I know exactly why you're here, so you may as well just take this and be on your way. I don't want your money, kid. All I want is a relationship with my daughter. - If you hurt her... - Hey, whoa, easy. I know you have no reason in the world to trust me, but how about you give me a shot, huh? Well, have you found a place in Seattle yet? - Nope. - No? - Nope. - I'm gonna miss you, dude. Gonna have to start watching The Kardashians to get my fill of drama in your absence. Landon, I'm only going to Seattle. You're just a FaceTime away. You can always visit. Between work and school, you are gonna be swamped. You're not gonna have any time for anything, like friends, family and especially not people like... People like who? Me? Is there something you wanna tell me, or should I ask Landon? He seems to know a lot more than I do. Not today, Satan. I am gonna see you both this weekend, - at the lake house. - Don't bet on it. - Okay. - We'll be there. - What? - What do you mean, what? When was this supposed to happen? - A week? - What? A week? You're going away in a week, you haven't even told me? When was I supposed to tell you? Because you left. Yeah, I'm here. I came back. And I came back for you. I couldn't get a hold of you for nine days. I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. So, what, is that it then? I mean... Yeah, this... This job's a huge opportunity for me. And... And I'm hoping, I was hoping, that you would come with me. I was hoping that we could move to London after graduation. And how was I supposed to know that? Well, I was gonna tell you. But it doesn't really matter anymore, does it? You've made up your mind, you've got a plan. Envisioned your life in a way that doesn't have me in it. You are in it, if you want to be. Look, I get that you're angry. And we do need to talk about this, except I have to get to class, so... We will continue this discussion. Oh, that's really big of you. To find time in your busy schedule. Thank you. Hey. Hi, Mom, how's London? Good. I just wanted to check you're okay. I heard that Tessa took the job with Vance, in Seattle. Where did you hear that? Christian and I were talking earlier. That's kind of weird. He and I have known each other since long before you were born. I'd prefer not everyone knows my business. Mom, I'm gonna call you back. Do you need a ride somewhere? Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. - Thanks. - Mm-hm. Hey, you wanna come inside? Fuck it, why not. Enjoy. What are we drinking about? I didn't know we needed a reason. Cheers to that. Oh, look at her in this one. Mmm. She looks really happy. I've really been trying. Now more than ever. - Yeah. - Well... Clearly not right now. But I am trying. You know, you really remind me of me when I was your age. - Fuck that. - Mmm, yeah. - Seriously? - Hey. Hey, buddy. Private conversation, if you don't mind. Hey, just trying to get some ideas. Whoa! That is my daughter, you fucking piece of shit. Hey. I'm sorry, who is this? What are you doing here? Uh, bonding. - Hey, Tess. - Hardin... What the hell did you do? - I didn't do any... - The bartender called me. Oh, come on. It wasn't a big deal. - Look, he's fine. - You're drunk. I had a drink. I just... Look, it was... - I was backing up your dad. - Really? I didn't start... He started it actually, so... Somebody called the cops. You probably called the cops, you snitch. Okay, let's go. Don't be mad at him. He loves you. That's all. Whoa! Yeah, you see that? Solid guy right there. - Why would anyone leave you? - I don't know. Yeah, this is just... It's so enjoyable. Why wouldn't I stay? I think we're in trouble. Hey, hey, hey, easy. You know, I'm not sure that I like this new friendship. I was just trying to be nice. I offered him a ride, and the bar was actually his idea. He's an alcoholic, and so are you. Two alcoholics walk into a bar. I'm glad you think this is funny. I was showing him some pictures of you on my phone, and this asshole leans over and starts saying what he'd like to do to you. So... I mean, so? So I told him I've already done that. - Hardin... - What? I'm apologizing. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Please forgive me. - I, that's... - That's not fair. - Please forgive me. - What if...? - Shh, he's asleep. Tessa. Oh, Tessa. Oh, fuck... So, uh, I heard you guys are moving. Yeah, yeah. I actually need to start packing. I'll just finish up and get out of here. No, no, no. No, I didn't mean it like... Nah, nah. You don't need me around here. I'll just... I got a few errands to run anyway. Dad... That feels really weird to say. Well, that'll be my ride. You're leaving now? Yeah. Come here. Thank you so much for letting me stay. No, stay, stay. He's coming. Uh, hey, don't... Don't disappear on me again. Hardin. So you shipping me out next? - You okay? - You know, it's not like I want to leave you. You don't have to. Vance's offer, it's literally... It's a dream come true. I've wanted to live in Seattle since I was a kid. The only thing that would make it better is if you came with me. I don't... I don't know why you want me there. I don't really fit into that flashy lifestyle. It's never been the kind of thing you've been after... - I want to make a life together. - So do I. So stay here, and we can. - You're not listening. - I am listening. - I've wanted this job since I... - I know. You have a great job in Seattle. That is great. I'm happy for you. But I don't. I don't have anything there. - You'd have me. - Okay, that's not enough. You know I didn't mean that. Well, if I'm... If I'm not enough, that's... That's your problem. But you're not gonna stop me. Vance Publishing, please hold. No, I can't. I'm swamped. You're gonna have to speak to my assistant. No, the new one. Um, well, I'll try and squeeze you in for 30 minutes this afternoon. Tessa! Hey, come in. - I can come back. - No, no. Come in. I'm just... - I'm heading out. - Yeah. - Um, you have a safe trip. - Okay. See you. Are you sure that you're okay driving up by yourself? - She's not going by herself. - I'm taking Smith with me. Besides, I prefer to get us settled up there while Christian finishes things here. Have you decided what part of town you'll be staying in? No, I'm still deciding between two places. It's scary trying to pick somewhere off the internet. No, Tessa. Just stay with us. You know, until you get situated. No, no. I couldn't ask... You didn't. Come on, it'll be fun. Christian will be thrilled. He's been dying to spend time with Hardin. Uh, well, he's actually not coming with me. Oh. Well, when he comes to visit, then. You know, between us, Christian was disappointed Hardin turned him down on his job offer. What... What job was that? Basically, anything he wanted. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Don't walk away from me. - Hey, don't follow me. - Tess, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I shouldn't have said it. Can you stop saying things you don't mean? I can't tell what's true. Can you stop making decisions without talking things through first? Okay. Okay. Kimberly invited me to stay with them in Seattle, - if that's not weird? - Did she? No, no, no. It's not weird. It's good. It's great. Vance is always gone, so I think it'll be a win-win. Yeah. How do you think they make that work, the long-distance? I don't know, they communicate? Heh, wait, wait, wait. What was that? - What? - The thing underneath the thing that you just said. Why didn't you tell me that Vance offered you a job in Seattle? Because I wasn't gonna take it. But why didn't you tell me that you weren't gonna take it? Here I am, begging you to come with me, - just to find out that... - He kept on harping on me. It wasn't something I wanted to deal with. Remember, at the time, I had no idea you were going. We do need to stop keeping secrets from each other. Agreed. We'll have fun this weekend, okay? Okay. You look like Popeye. - A very sexy Popeye, come on. - Get up, we're gonna be late. We could've just met you there, couldn't we? Why did we have to all come together? - We could've made our own way. - It's a long drive. And this way, we get to have some very much needed family time. Yeah. Much needed, great. You're lucky I love you. Okay, I spy with my little eye something black. Black. Easy, Hardin's soul. - Oh, yeah, ha-ha! - Hey! - Come on, boys! - That's why. - Boys... - That's why your soul is black. Hey, don't touch this! Shut up! Are you still going to New York? Yeah, I've got everything set up at NYU, so I'm just gonna... I guess, go with the flow, you know? Mmm. I need to get better at that. Are you having... You having second thoughts? And third and fourth and fifth and... I don't know. I'm just worried that I made the wrong decision. - Tess... - It's just, apparently... Hardin wanted me to go England with him after graduation. And I don't know. Maybe I should. You've been gushing about Seattle since the day I first met you. Why stray from your path? - Go with the flow? - No, no. Cop-out. That's not you. That's me. You have to do you. Yeah, and what about him? What about him? Mr. Grumpy? He's... If he loves you, he could... follow you. I'm just saying. Ooh! Wow. Mm, some hard truth. It's tough love. - I'm gonna need more wine. - Good luck. See? Did you see...? I don't want to lose this. I don't either. But, "If adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad." But, "There is nothing like staying at home for real comfort." "You pierce my soul. I'm half agony, half hope." "We are all fools in love." I thought you were Darcy. And you've just been Jane Austen the whole time. So are you gonna show me what you're writing there? I... Maybe. Someday. Someday. - Reservation for Scott. - Yes, Mr. Scott. Right this way. - Thank you. - Hardin? - Ha! Hey, Lilly. How are you? - Mm! - How are you? - No fucking way. - Long time, huh? - It's been forever. - This is Tessa. Tessa, Lillian. - Hi. Nice dress. I'll be over in a second. I might get something different, but... Really? Crab cakes. - Good evening, folks. - Yes. Good evening. I'm Robert. I'll be taking care of you tonight. Can I get you started with a round of drinks? Yeah. I think we'll do a bottle of Cab for the table. - And some water for us. - I think we're ready to order. - Great, what'll it be? - You're gonna get the... - Crab cakes. - Yes. And I'm gonna get the... - fish and chips. - Fish and chips. And also, we would like to get a sablefish for after the meal to take home. That's a good choice. - And for you? - Um, is there anything that you'd recommend? The cedar-planked salmon is our specialty. Okay. I'm more into like pasta? Carbs, yeah. I love carbs. Um, we have a squid-ink spaghetti. Um, it was lovely to see you and to meet you guys, but I'll have to go. Sorry. Too fancy. How about we whip you up something special? Yeah, okay. Thank you. Can I get you anything, or do you need a minute? Yeah, you can come back. Robert. - Thanks, man. - Thank you, Robert. Thank you. Alone at last. Ooh! That's good. Come on, before they get home. Ow, ow! I really hope they're having more than one cocktail. You do kind of like it, though. The thrill of being caught. Oh, that's nice. Trust me. I really wish you were coming to Seattle. - Can I ask you a question? - Mmm. Does your moving to Seattle have anything to do with Trevor? No. No. I mean... we barely even talk anymore. Did you ever have feelings for him? - That's two questions. - Tess, be honest. Uh, there was a moment when... Hey! Seriously? That's not fair! Hardin! Leave a message. Hey, where are you? Can you give me a call back? - Robert. - Right. Um, Tessa. So, what are you doing out here? I had a fight with my... It's complicated. Well, a few of us are doing after hours, if you wanna join. - Um, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Heh, you probably should've worn a coat. - So you live here, right? - Born and raised. But I actually just got into med school. - Oh, wow. - Yeah, so just working here, saving up till then. - Wow, congratulations. - Thanks. Where are you going? UW was my dream, but Mount Sinai gave me a scholarship - I couldn't pass up, so... - Mount Sinai is in...? - NYC. - Okay. New York City. You've heard of it. The Big Apple, you know? And Nora, actually, Nora and I went to undergrad together and then she moved out there, so I'll know someone. Talking shit? Yeah? She's already got the New York attitude. - Tess. Hey. - Hey! Hey. Okay, so this is Robert, and this is Nora. Yes, there will be a test afterwards. And they both live in New York. Thank you. In New York? Pleasure. Hey! What? Oh, my God! How are you? It's been... - You remember Robert, right? - Yeah. I remember Robert. I'll do an old fashioned, actually. Oh. I'm off, actually. You're still wearing your name tag and your uniform, so... So I heard that you're moving to Seattle. Yeah, um, I'm actually transferring for work. Ah, I'm jealous. I'd much rather be in Seattle than New York. I keep telling Hardin he should give it a shot. - It's not for me. - No, it's not for him. - It's the best. - It's the best. It is, yeah. My girlfriend and I, we've lived in Capitol Hill for a few years now. - Oh, your girlfriend? - Yeah, my girlfriend, Riley. We should probably leave now. I don't really wanna go just yet. I'm gonna head home. Let me walk you out. - I'm really sorry about all of... - You don't have to apologize. Sorry. Sorry. Heh! I don't know why I do that. I could guess, but I won't. Um, it was nice meeting you. You too. And thanks for... Mm-hm. I'm not expecting anything, but if someday you find yourself in the city... give me a call. Or don't. It's up to you. Hey. Hey. Morning. - What's that face? - How was... How was last night? Oh, it was good. It was... It was fine. Nora's nice. She's, uh... She's kind of a big deal on the restaurant scene, so she's gonna show me around when I get to New York. - That's really convenient. - It's all about... Heh-heh. How was... How was the hot tub? Guess what Landon found. I thought that we were gonna be more open with each other. So did I. I didn't ask for his number. He just gave it to me. It... No. I just found another guy's number in your things. You made it look like you were with Lillian last night. - Lillian's my friend. - So is he. You guys just met. How could you be friends? You do this. You sabotage every good moment that we have. No. If I wanted to try and sabotage a good moment, I would have brought up your moment with Trevor, - but I'll do one at a time. - Why can't you let things be? - Like, let us be happy for once. - Tess, you must admit, if I were moving away with an admitted love interest, - you'd have feelings about that. - Love interest? We're friends. From work. You don't get to choose who I have as friends. They don't wanna be your fucking friends! Then why can't you just trust me? I do trust you. It's them I don't trust. No, you don't. You don't trust me. You don't trust anyone. You just control them. Is this really about them, or is this about me moving? The irony is, I got you the damn job in the first place. I mean, I might have had something to do with it. Tess, how many freshmen do you know with jobs at top publishing firms, their transfer's taken care of, places to live, how many? Wow. This honesty thing's really paying off for us. So I won't... I won't give up Seattle for you, so you just turn on me? There is a big difference between not being able to live without someone and loving them. He is scared of losing you. He loves you. He knows you're the best thing that's ever happened to him. - Well... - No, Tessa, it's true. You've changed his life. He knows it. We all know it. You stay in touch. Okay. Bye. She's gonna thrive up there, man. What, and that's a bad thing? This is a big step for her. You should be happy for her. I am. I am happy. You could come with her. I've got loads of work for you... - I don't wanna do that. - You'd get great benefits. I don't want your handouts. I'm sorry, I... They're the reason I'm here, and I don't want any more help. Tessa didn't get a favor. She's excellent. She earned this position. She does deserve it. I'm sure she'll do smashingly. Tessa? Tess? Tess? Pain. Lately, I've become very well acquainted with it. The slow and steady aching pain, the type that comes when you've been hurt repeatedly by the same person. You finally breathe, thinking that yesterday's problem will stay in the past when, in fact, it's today's problem, tomorrow's problem, and the problem of every day after that. Only in those rare moments when he pulls me to his chest and makes promises he never seems able to keep does the pain disappear. Shit. She looks upset. - Hey! - Hey! Let me take that for you upstairs. Oh, thanks. - Welcome home. - Thanks. Well, you look... ...terrible. Come here. Oh, uh, excuse me. Do you guys know where Bagley Hall is? - Hello? - Hey. Hey. What's going on? Hardin, come back here! Tess, wait. Don't hang up. That was Iskra, my trainer. - I'm at the gym. - I'm kicking his ass, Tess! And he is not kicking my ass. I didn't mean to hang up. I think you did, and I know exactly why, 'cause I would have thought the same thing. Yeah, I'm a little relieved. It's nice, showing Landon the ropes. Don't take all day. Okay, one minute. You okay, though? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. How was the drive down? Was it not too long? It was good, but when you get in the city, the traffic's terrible. It takes like 20 minutes to go a mile. And Vance and Kimberly's? Yeah, yeah, it's great. The, um... The place is amazing. It's like... It's huge. It's like a palace. Nice. I'm really glad, Tess. - I'm sorry I hurt you. - You don't... No, I... I just want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy. It's cool that you're boxing. I know, right? I really fucking like it. It's nice to be able to punch people and not have anyone call the police. I think that that's a step forward. Right? I'm trying a new approach. Hardin. This is not leisure hour. Come on. I really have to go now, but I'm so glad you called. Yeah. Yeah, me too. All right. We'll talk soon. - Bye, Tess. - Bye. - Yes. - He's a pretty boy. You scared to fight Landon? You heard... Oh, shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Vance Publishing, please hold. Selfies, huh? No, I was... I was just showing Hardin my new office. Mm-hm. Seattle looks good on you. So how's it going? Fine. Yeah. I mean, work, school. It's a lot, but it's fine. Give it time. You'll settle in. You'll find a place. It's exciting. Are you sure that you don't want a glass? I think she might be on to us, darling. Well, we have some news. We just found out... we're having a baby. Are you kidding? I'm so happy for you guys. I'm gonna tell Hardin though, if that's all right with you. Yeah, yeah, of course. Ken mentioned that he'd managed to get his GPA up to a 4.0. He must be looking forward to graduating. Yeah, that's great. Um, I didn't even know that. It's because of you. I mean, I didn't write his papers. No, well... Maybe not, I'm sure he did that. But, well, he has got a gift, that boy. But he's stubborn as hell. You're one to talk. Touché. Well, I should get some sleep, but I will see you guys tomorrow? Yeah, of course. And you should take this. It's too nice of a bottle to go to waste. - Yes, please. - Don't worry about me. I won't have any. - You don't need any more. - Good night, darling. - Good night. - You have to suffer like me. There you are. I just got back from the gym. You did? Wow, you must be getting pretty good. Are you drunk? I was hanging out with Vance and Kimberly, and she gave me the rest of the bottle. Oh, yeah? So how much wine have you had? I'm on my... third? You were actually quite the topic. You didn't answer my call earlier. No, I know. I've been at work since, like, 8:00. Except for taking office selfies. - Which you didn't respond to. - Tessa. Hardin Allen Scott. Why are you laughing? It's just all so ridiculous. I think you need to put that wine down. Make me. Well, I would if I was there. What else would you make me do? Theresa Lynn Young, are you trying to have phone sex with me? Tell me what you would do if you were here. - Are you lying in your bed? - Mm-hm. Close your eyes. - Are they closed? - Mm-hm. Are you sure? Fuck, I wish I was there watching you right now. You like that, don't you? Watching me? Fuck, yeah, I do. How'd you sleep? Good. Not as good as I do with you. I know the feeling. Come here. I miss you. I miss you too. Don't say "too." It sounds like you're just agreeing with me. I love you. I love you. Tessa? Tessa? Tess! No, no, no, Tessa! Tessa! Tessa! Tessa! Tess! No, no, no! - I love you. - I love you too. Fuck you! No, no! - Hi. Hi. - Hi. What... What are you doing here? Well, I came to see you. But I can leave. No. - I'm gonna get my bags. - Mm-mm. Give us a hand. What's the fastest train you've been on? - There's this train in Japan. - Oh, hey! - Hey, hey. - Hardin. Smith, what's up? - How are you doing? - Fine. He asked if he could stay, and I thought you might be all right with that. It's a lovely place. Where should I drop my stuff? - Uh, let me show you. - Cool. I'll call you guys when dinner's ready. - Sounds good. - It's this way. It's nice to see a smile back on her face. It is. So, um, I found this. And I'm really sorry, but once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. You're a brilliant writer, Tess. And I came across that page about pain and I just wanted to apologize. The way I made you feel is inexcusable. So I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to read any of this... - I'm sure you didn't. - It's pretty raw. I needed to hear it. In your words. And I fucking hate myself for making you feel that way, but I'm sorry. Thank you. Hey! Steaks are on! Be right there! Oh. Will we? I love you too. We shouldn't keep them waiting. What? I mean, I'm sure that they're fine. Come on, I'm hungry. He really wants me to go. He keeps talking about me wearing the hat and the gown and everything. - What's so bad about that? - It just looks ridiculous. Can you imagine me in the hat and the gown and everything? I don't even wanna go to the ceremony. I can't imagine it, but I really wanna see it. You gotta celebrate your accomplishments. You don't wanna look back and regret having not had those experiences. Trust me, I know firsthand. - I'll give it some thought. - I think you should. - Hey, buddy. - Hi. This needs turning, do you wanna do it? - Why not? - Okay. There you go. Grab that. - This is really nice. - Yeah. You know, all of us together, under one roof. - Here we all are. - Yeah. - Well, tonight, anyway. - Oh, come on. You two will work it out. Sometimes distance is a good thing. Mmm. You think so? Honestly, I have no idea. Look, relationships... they're complicated. Hey. Did I do something? You've barely said a word to me the whole night. I had this horrible dream of you and Robert. I can't get it out of my fucking head. But I'm here with you. That's exactly it. I can't help but think that you should be with someone else. Your life would be so much easier. There's all this bad shit that I've been trying to suppress for so long. It's just all coming up. And there's nothing I can do. The thought of losing you is just, heh... It's pretty fucking dark in here, Tess. Why didn't you just tell me? That's the whole point of being open... Because it's a burden for me, and I don't wanna burden you. I don't want to be with anyone else. I wanna be with you. Hey. Fuck me until you forget about that dream. Oh, fuck. Look in the mirror. Oh, yes, baby. - You close? - Yeah. We didn't use protection last night. Yeah, I know. I'll have to go to the drugstore tonight. I should get on the pill anyway. Yeah. Yeah, you with no condom, on a regular basis, that's gonna work for me. Here are the kids. Hey, hey. You look in better spirits this morning. Yeah, think I just needed a good night's sleep. Oh, it's Mom. One sec, guys. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, my love. How are you doing? Good, thanks. How are you? That must be about the wedding. Uh, whose wedding? - Trish is...? Oh, my God. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Oh, that's amazing. She deserves it. Yeah. And Mike is a good guy. So he'll look after her. - Okay, let's go. - Oh! - Okay. - Come on, bud. - Smith. - What? Hey, hey, hey! Backpack. Hey. - Bye. - Bye. I will, I will, I will. All right. Bye. What? What? So? So, what do you wanna do today? - Got everything? - Yep. There's nothing... There's nothing you've forgotten? No, I think I'm good. What happened to our not keeping secrets from each other? - What are you on about? - You're not gonna tell me about your mom's wedding? Tess... the only reason I haven't told you - is because I don't want to go. - Okay. Why... Why don't you wanna go? I thought you wanted to show me your hometown. I wanna show you London. I do not wanna show you my hometown. If you don't wanna bring me, I think that that's fine. But it's her big day. I really think you need to be there for her. If I was going, I would bring you, but... Do you know what, I'll think about it. - Okay? - Okay. Hey, this was a good weekend. - How good? - This good. Better. Can you come back on Wednesday? Vance is having an event. I'll try. Okay. Richard? I nearly smashed your fucking head in! What the fuck are you thinking, breaking in here? You weren't here, and, uh... Tess told me where you keep the key. You look like shit. Yeah, well, uh, I owe a guy. - How much are you in for? - Five hundred. You can take this. Here. My dad gave me that. I never wear it. It's worth a lot more than what you need, so... Thanks. Yeah. I'm gonna get better for her. I'm gonna get better. I promise. This should protect you from pregnancy for the next three months. My concern is... you may not need it. It's your cervix. You may not be able to get pregnant. We need to do more tests before we know. Hmm. As much as I'd like to help, by the time you apply for the transfer, you register and start classes, I don't think it's worth the hassle. And I don't think you're gonna get the classes you need to graduate. I figured you were gonna say this. - Just thought I'd give it a try. - It's only two months. And you know, it's been one of my biggest dreams to see you graduate. I guess it hasn't always been a given, has it? No, no. It hasn't. It has been a gift, having you here. And I'm grateful that you were willing to give me a chance to see me sober. Yeah. When was that? Oh, that was freshman year. Your mom, Vance and I. Never seen it before. You know she's getting married. - To Mike? - To Mike. Oh, good for her. He always seemed like a nice guy. I've always thought he was a bit of a wanker, but if she's happy. Two months! It's just gonna go like... - Hey! - Hello. Don't you two look gorgeous. Obviously. Relax, it's soda water. - Did you tell him? Did...? - Vance called me. - Oh. - Well, enjoy. - I have to go play hostess. - Okay. They were ecstatic when I told them you were coming. What, just them? Well, I was... I was happy. Um... I do have some bad news. Oh. Uh, what? It's not looking like I'm gonna be able to get here - for another two months. - What, uh...? What do you mean, like visit? Wait, what? What? What do you mean? I mean, like, for good. Like... Uh, wait. - Do you mean like move here? - It's two months, though. - I wonder if I should even... - Are you serious? Should I call the whole thing off? Maybe I should cancel it. - I love you so much. - I love you. Hate to break it up, but I wanna dance! Come on! How are you, my boy? - There's my boy. - Hey. - How are you? - Never better. - I gotta go to work. - Go ahead. - Let's go. Right now. Yeah? - Mm-hm. You're moving here. Yeah. Right. - Your elbows are up again. - Oh, man. All right, then. You looking forward to visiting home? I know I am. Oh, I see. Celebrating your mom's happiness doesn't sound appealing? It's not that. So, what's going on? I really want to bring Tessa, but I don't want to bring her around my old life. It's just a sad house in a sad place. Has she ever made you feel badly about your past? - No. - The only way you can find out if you trust her is to trust her. And it'd mean the world to Trish, having you both there. Look. Seriously, mate. Your wedding is a moment that's... bigger than anything else that you can possibly imagine. - Kind of changes you. - Mm-hm. And that's why they all fail, right? Not all of them. Not if you find the right one. You know, I believe that you have two real great loves. So in your case, that would be Tessa and you. You gonna show me what you got? - Yeah. Come on, then. - Aah! I got us tickets to England. Mmm... - Keep the change. - Don't worry, Mom. I'll get it. - No, no, no. I've got it. - Hi. Oh, it's so good to see you both. Jesus, Tessa. Is there a body in there? I didn't know how much I'd need. Here you go. Thank you. How was the flight? Sorry it's not more comfortable. I didn't expect the house to sell on the first day. No, it's great. I left your bed up, Hardin. I wasn't expecting to sleep on the floor. It's perfect. Thank you. Well, you guys must be exhausted. So I'll leave you to it. I'm staying next door at Mike's. Okay. Hey, give me a sec... - We're really happy for you. - Thank you. I'm glad you came. I've gotta go to the bridal store in the morning. I was wondering, do you wanna come? - Yeah, I'd love to. That's... - Great. Great. - Call me if you need me. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Don't take any of my stuff or go in my room, and definitely don't have any friends over, okay? Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for letting me stay here. Yeah, well, don't thank me, because it's not permanent. Yeah, yeah. I know. Make sure you call if there's a problem. Sure thing, Hardin. Bye. Who was that? That was a random homeless man who I've been letting sleep on my couch. All the hipsters are doing it these days. - Thank you. - Of course. - There's nothing to eat. - What are you looking for? I don't know. Something edible. That I don't have to cook, preferably. Look, why don't you take the keys and go to Sainsbury's. It'll give you something to do when we're gone. Hi. - You ready? - Yep. Are you sure you're not jet-lagged? - I feel fine. - You don't have to go, you know. Hardin. Come on, Tessa. Let's do this. I really shouldn't. I'm sorry, guys. Have one for me. Hey, man. Come on. Man. Yep. That's it. You really look amazing. It's beginning to feel real. What's her dress like? Mmm... I can't tell you. You're seriously not gonna tell me? Yeah, I can't tell you. You're gonna have to wait and see. Don't care that much anyway. Please tell me. No, I won't tell you. I'm so glad you came. You're my better place, Tess. - What the fuck?! - Oh, fu...! Vance! Fucking hell! - It's not what you think. - Are you fucking kidding me? Well, it clearly fucking is! You're getting married tomorrow. What the fuck is wrong with you? The love of your life, Kimberly, is carrying your child while you're here... - That's enough! - What is wrong with you? Hardin? - Vance? - Yeah. He's been fucking my mom! Please, Hardin, just stop it! Don't yell at me. You don't get to tell me what to do. You were getting fucked on the counter like a slag. Don't you talk to your mom like that. - Oh, fuck off! - Hey. Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do, huh? - You really want to know? - No, Christian, don't. - Enough, Hardin! - Stop, stop. - Hardin, please stop it! - Stop it! Ugh! Please, Hardin. Hardin, that's enough! That's enough! Enough. That's enough. You're getting married tomorrow. Did you forget? Who the fuck does that? What are you going to tell Mike? Hardin, Christian and I... - He's... - What? It's not that simple. Okay, let's go. - Tessa, don't. - Let's go. Are you all right? Can you...? It's okay. It's okay. It is not okay. It's not okay. - Please, don't ever let me go. - I won't. I'll never let you go. That even though you're a superhero in my eyes, you are still human. Mike Richards, do you take Trish Daniels for better or worse? I do. I really do. I'm happy to pronounce you husband and wife. - Hardin... - I have nothing to say to you. - Come on. - Get the fuck off me! Do you wanna go again, old man? If that's what it takes, yeah. - There's a bar in the hotel. - A fucking bar? It's just down the street. I'll wait there for you. I can come if you want me to. But either way, I think you should go. She looks like she doesn't need telling. Yeah. She definitely knows. I'm gonna go sit with her, but if anything goes wrong, just come find me. I'm surprised to see you here. Yeah. I'm afraid I won't be able to stay as angry as I am. Trust me, I am. But what do I do? I love him. And I love the life we're building, and I love Smith. You wanted to talk, let's talk. I know you feel betrayed. I want to explain myself. But I honestly don't know where to begin. - I guess that makes us done then. - Look, listen. You are so important to me and your mom. Are you serious? Now you two want to play some sort of united front? - Fuck off with that. - You wouldn't be so angry if you didn't care. You know, I wish I could say I'm surprised... but I'm not. They have a history together. One that I'm not sure I can compete with. I was gonna tell you ages ago, but your mom didn't want... Tell me what? Tell me what? Hardin is Christian's son. Fuck! - You... What the fuck! - I'm so sorry. No! I'm sorry. I have to go.
