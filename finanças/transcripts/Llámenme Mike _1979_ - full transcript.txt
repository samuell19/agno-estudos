Carmelita! Carmelita! - She's asleep. - What? What are we going to do, Miguel? Shit... Oh, Carmela. She wouldn't let me fuck her. - She didn't want to. - ''Didn't want to.'' She said that at first. Women are like that. They don't want to, but... Leave it. She went off it, that's all. We had some fun, didn't we? Come on. Hurry. - Over there. - Yeah, yeah. - Right there. - That's it. - The hand. - Wait. The slut... lf l can't have her, someone else can have that cokehead. Look at her now. A corpse! - We can't leave her like that. - Should we give her a funeral? No. But she was alright. She was. She was... He wouldn't take her, because she had a weak heart. - Look at her now. - Let's go! - Come on! - What are we supposed to do? Tomorrow we'll find a suspect. Get in! Hi! - What did he say? - That at 8:00... - Your juice, sir. - With eggs. - What's he saying? - That it should go down. - His dick? - The steam. - Hey, you! - Just a little. Lower the steam. Anything else, sir? - What did he say now? - That at 8:00 sharp... '''Jesus Christ!' Sam groaned, and put down his hamburger. He watched him carefully as he pondered the warning: 'You'll soon be wearing concrete boots, Sammy.' Sammy knew the man wasn't joking. 'Damn it,' he groaned again, and added...'' Come in! - What's up, Chapo? - lt's finished. - How did it go? - lt's perfect. lt's all right. You just missed me. - Are you fighting already? - lt just went off. - Your chilaquiles are ready. - l haven't got time, Mom. He'll get an ulcer soon. l have something for you. - Can l come with you? - lt's just for grownups. - Let me come. - No. l know where they have porn. We could go there and get it. You know Don Esteban? He's gay, you know. We can take some photos. Look what l've got for you, Chapo. There you go. But when you grow up, it's going to fit you perfectly. Carmelita has been gone five days now. You know what she's like. You're not upset because you missed me, are you? Carlitos! What time is it? Eight o'clock, sharp. Come on! What have we got here? Very good. Take it easy. Don't try messing with us. You know why. Very good. This is controlled from higher up. You'll get into trouble. - Where's the good stuff? - She's the only one here. Don't try acting all innocent with me. Leave him alone. That's enough. That's enough, Miguel. Give me back my wig! Give me back my wig! - Give it to me! - Shut up! My wig... Getting closer? Colder and colder. - Did you get a scratch? - Let's go, Pelupe. What a ''blow''! lt's not even 250 grams. Do you think l believe that this is all there was? - l swear... - You couldn't if you tried. l'm tired of having to work against irresponsibility, corruption, abuse and incompetence. Tell me. What will l have to account for? We're up against an enormous drug organization. Where are the rest of the drugs? Who's got it? Dialogue! Dialogue! l thought Pitacio behaved quite irresponsibly. - lrresponsibly, you say. - l don't know who told the press. lf you were given the orders to strike it was because we knew that in that apartment there was a considerable amount of drugs; almost two kilos of pure cocaine hidden in a vase filled with plastic flowers. There were no flowers there, boss. - lsn't that true? - l didn't see any. Are you, or are you not captain? You've got 24 hours to hand over all of the confiscated goods. lf l don't get them, you'll all be sent down. Get out of my office! - l know how l'll do it. - Are you friends of Carmela? - Who? - Carmela. Carmela Vargas. That's the one. She's been found dead. - Really? - Where was she found? ln Acapulco. They left her in a motel. Leave me alone. l already told you l don't want anything to do with you. Well, l do. Let go! Well, well, well... - l don't like you. - You're a hard woman. That's right. - But l love you, Zoila. - What about my time? l'll be real romantic, so that you understand. One hour here with me or 1 5 days in jail. What'll it be? We're in big trouble, Miguelito. - Which one of us has got it? - That doesn't matter. Someone's got to pay my share. Well, yeah... l love you so much, Miguelito. l've known you since you were a little boy. Since you were a little squirt. Who recommended you to the force? l did! How many favors do you owe me? l owe you everything. How many times have l saved your life? - Three times! - Four times. Four. lt's going to hurt me, but l'm passing the debt on to you. She's got the flu. No, Miguelito, no... Not the face, Miguelito, no... l haven't got anything. They haven't paid me. l haven't got any more. l promise, you'll get it tomorrow. l'd better. lf not, l'll deal with you. Here's the debt. l didn't mean that kind of debt. But l'm like your son, boss. lt's unconditional. Exactly. You're the only one who can take this kind of bullet. Yes, but l haven't got any prior records. - l always pay on time. - So, you want me to go? So that this poor old man dies? Never mind my heart... Never mind my gray hair... Why did you take it, boss? One damned moment of weakness. lt was the Devil that put it in my way, the Devil. The Devil... l've brought some tea to calm the nerves. - lt's lime-blossom tea. - Thank you, Do√±a Mati. - Are you going on a mission? - We were talking about that. - lt's only for six months. - Where? You know that l always look out for Miguelito. Remember the hubcaps for my Mustang. And the CV antenna. Of course not. Take care, now. One more thing. Florita was mugged when she came from Laredo. Help her. Of course l will. Bye, bye. - Will l be out in six months? - When did l ever let you down? - But six months... - Not a minute longer. And afterwards? Afterwards you'll be back with honors. Miguel Contreras. You're under arrest. Look up, Miguelito. You look like an artist, Miguel. Here it is, Miguelito. Tell us if you need anything. What's up, Miguelito? What are you doing here? - Another error of justice? - More or less, Michelio. Did you go too far? How many years have you been here for? All of them. And the ones l have left. Nobody's getting me out of here. KlSS ME, DEADLY Look at this. We can't allow this behavior within the force. - ls that clear? - Yes, sir. l think you're right. l'd like to take the opportunity to talk about Miguelito. He's a good guy. We have to stamp out the drug organization. And also get rid of the camaraderie within the force. With education, political conscience and social conscience, we can better our image. We'll earn the citizens' trust and be free of suspicions that tarnish our credibility. Start investigating the drug organization. And l don't want any scapegoats. Don't forget to watch ''Six Years'' on TV tomorrow. You'll learn more about our latest projects. - What about it, then? - What? This thing with Miguel. Drive! ''The shot rang out and shook the room. Charlotte stumbled and took a step back. Her eyes were a symphony of disbelief. A horrified witness to the truth. Slowly she lowered her eyes to the gaping wound in her belly. A stream of blood flowed from where the bullet had entered. l got down in front of her and put the gun in the bag. l turned my back to her and looked at the plant behind me. There on the table was the gun. The silencer was on. She could easily have reached it with her lovely arms.'' Good evening, Miguelito. Oh, hi. Sorry to interrupt, but some friends want to say hello to you. This here is ''Satan.'' He's better known as ''The Deaf One,'' since you fired a gun close to his ear. ''The Nut,'' who went twisted after you beat him up. ''The Sausage.'' They destroyed his bladder and now he has to go every half hour. ''The Ear,'' pleaded guilty to get you off his back. - You too, eh? - He claims he's innocent. Please excuse me. l have to go. l guess you have a lot to talk about. This is the first shift. The next one is waiting its turn. Allow me. - He knows karate. - Black belt. We'll put black ribbons on your door. After what had happened, I had to be aIert. The vaIues of our democracy were in danger. Some minds were turning red. After many years of trying to destroy our moraI vaIues, the Commies had turned to a new Ieader,; Boris aIias ""Red. "" The Free WorId was in danger. My onIy Iead was Sammy, the owner of the biIIiard haII on 54th Street. The meeting wiII be soon. Head trauma and lesions with severe bleeding and scarring of the brain can lead to serious brain damage. - lt can cause mental problems. - What does that mean? ln medical terms or layman's terms? We'll surgically reconstruct the brain by almost bionic means. We'll do some psychological tests. lf he doesn't respond favorably, he'll be sent to a mental hospital. The loony bin. So you don't want to talk, eh? You've got to help us. - Ask him about his childhood. - Tell us about your childhood. Talk about your frustrations. - Did you want a toy train? - Did your mother punish you? - Were you beaten? - Did you study? Until what age? Did you use too much Pentothal? Miguelito! Miguelito? That's the mouse. Call me Mike. - Miguel... - Mike! Mike. The boys sent you this. Open it. Look! lt's chocolate. Take one. They say that you'll be well soon. l am well! Yes, l know. But there are forms to fill out, you know what it's like. Goal! Goal! Don't be sad, Mike. Look how happy everybody is. How could you join the conspiracy? - Tell me it isn't true. - Of course not. The red spider web has covered us all. We have to fight it. There is no other way. We have to crush those bastards. You know what l mean? Yes, yes... - Don't try getting in my way. - Yes, no... ''No''? No, l mean, yes... l mean... You do what's best for you. There's going to be bloodshed. They haven't heard the last of me. You keep your big mouth shut. You know what l mean? Yes. Okay, okay... They'll hear from me. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. l have seen you hold the flaming sword that will guide the way. - The cleansing fire is near. - Who sent you? - The great Lord of justice. - What do you know about Red? The skies will turn red and the church bells will fall. Stop talking in code. You seem to have big ears. There are those who guard the seed of doubt in their heart. - Whose side are you on? - l'm for those who crave justice. You could be out for my blood. There will be four horsemen of the Apocalypse. l knew it. l knew it. We've got to escape. To the promised land. Where only the righteous will live and rejoice. And kneeling before our Lord we'll be pure and crystal clear. - Are you prepared to kill Red? - My blood will be shed before the feet of Our Lord. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Up until now, everything's going well for them. Yeah, boys. l've still got some cards up my sleeves. No technocrat will ever brainwash me. l know the method. And the wires. Korea, 1 948... l spent all night trying to work out the message, professor. Something's boiling inside of me. Prepare your cleansing fire for tonight. The flames will light up your hearts. When the flaming sword comes down on your heads you shall repent! Repent! Repent! Repent before you are doomed. Repent! Repent all of you. Repent! Repent! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Hallelujah! - Come on. Yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no. Yes, yes. No! No! No! Pretend to be crazy. That's good, professor. Water! Water! Water! Water! - Water! - Fire! Fire! Hurry! Hurry! l'm the one, Lord! l am, l am! Here comes the ambulance! - Throw, throw. - lt's the police. Miguelito. Miguelito. Mike. Call me Mike. Shorty. - This is Dr. Callahan. - Nice to meet you. Dr. Callahan works for the Pentagon. Washington. lt's so good to see you again. They told me you were... The Commies made that up, Shorty. And the car? lt's a long story, Shorty. Coffee? Tea? A smoke? The Reds are on to me, Shorty. l need your help. Clothes, guns... - ...and money. - l'd do anything for you. Take Dr. Callahan to my mother's house. And keep your mouth shut and get rid of the ambulance. Take my car. Good boy. Take it easy, professor. He's like a brother. You could trust him with your life. - Can l come with you? - This is serious business. These are tough guys and you'd only get me into trouble. Who is it? - An old friend. - l'm already asleep. Open the door, or l'll smash it. - Miguel. - Mike. Call me Mike. My friends usually call me that. What the hell do you want, ''Mike''? Maybe a sandwich with lots of mustard. l didn't know you liked Mexican food. - Get right to the point. - l want to talk about that. Your rights. Very hot! - Stop acting like an idiot. - No, l mean it. The Reds will stop at nothing. They have no scruples. By the way, are you back on the force? No, l'm my own boss now. You can't trust anyone, you know. l don't want to be tough on you, baby. l have enough trouble with Dominguez. l couldn't have imagined that he was mixed up in this. Up to his elbows. But l'm through with him. Go on, baby. Go on. Why should l, if you already know him? Don't worry, baby. Mike will take care of him. Will you? ln exchange for what? lf it's about Guatemala... - Boris. l want Boris. - l don't know who he is. What do you know about Sammy? ln the billiard hall on 54th Street? Do you mean Samuel at Don Julio's billiard hall? Maybe. They say he's a drug dealer. For Christ's sake! lt's all becoming clearer, baby. Are you really going to help me with Dominguez? He's just a pawn. l don't know what you're talking about. But l like your ways. Class, baby. lt's called class. Kiss me, Mike. The fire at the mentaI hospitaI has cIaimed eight Iives. The victims have not been identified due to the magnitude of the fire. The hospitaI director cIaims that the fire was deIiberate and that former hospitaI staff might have started it. An ambuIance is reported missing. The poIice are investigating this tragic event. - Sad he ended up like that. - Like ashes from a cigar. He's better off dead than causing us trouble. One musketeer less. - The chief is really mad. - About that thing with Miguel? No, not about Miguel, about that interview on TV that he gave to those women. We have to catch the dealers or we'll be back on the beat. - That won't be easy. - l'd like to quit the force. lf you don't give it up, we'll have to keep working. So let's go. Abraham has found his Sara again. Blessed are those poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Paradise shall be recovered. The fruit of good and evil shall unite our hearts. - Behold the Lord of the armies. - That's beautiful. lt reminds me of Miguel's father. May God preserve him by His side. - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Mike sent me. He's like Santa Claus. l'll put it in here. - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! We're taking apart the ambulance motor. We're going to sell it. - Where did you get all that? - Mike is taking care of you. - Who? - Mike, your son. He's changed his name, because he's on a mission. Mike, the flaming sword. He'll liberate the world from evil spirits. You make a lovely pair. Don't pay any attention to this boy. The flesh is weak. But if God tempts me, will l be able to resist? l'd like him as Mike's father. Balls! - Don't you recognize me? - l've switched sides. - The game's over for you. - But we're on the same side. lf you pull, you'll have to deal with the Turk who fixed it. l knew that the Arabs were in on this. - Let go. - Tell me about Red. Boris. Doesn't the name ring a bell? - Why are you shivering? - Let me go now. Red. Fondling balls, eh? Help me. Hello? Hello? - lt's for you. - Who is it? Who is it? Now you and l are going to talk without interruptions. No, l give in. Good. We understand one another. - Where is he? - Who? Don't even try. No rat has ever double-crossed me. - Boris, the Red. Where is he? - l don't know who he is. My supplier's called Leandro. lt's probably Leo. They always use similar names. - Where can l find him? - He's always around. Hanging around. He's usually at a bar. What's it called? ''The Red Seven.'' lt all adds up. Not a word about this or l'll come back and rip your teeth out and crack open your skull. - Wonton soup or chop suey? - Give me something Western. Wonton soup and chop suey. You're a quick learner. Ever hear about coffee? With milk? Black! - Leave me alone! - Just a little. You'll get it when you've paid me what you owe me. l can't stand it any longer. Give it to me! You've got two hours to pay me back what you owe me. Give it to me... Are the two hours up? Dogs like you deserve a bullet between the eyes. You don't want me. l just distribute it. l'm not the boss. l know. You're just a traitor. l'll have to splatter the walls with your brain. l'll have to leave more trash on the garbage dump. Are you ready to confess? Or do you need more convincing? l'll tell you what l know. Your connection with the gooks is obvious. - Where can l find Red? - What? Right, Red. l only know my supplier. He's called Rampazo. - Good. Where's his hold-out? - At ''The Blue Fox''. - You'll do as l tell you. - Yes... Hello? Who? One moment. Paco Sanchez. Someone wants to talk to the journalist at La Fuente. What do they want? Closed. Why do you do that to me? Yes? Hello? Where? Who is this? Yes... Can l have the address again? l've got it. Mix them up. - Who was it? - The Anonymous Judge. Some madman who calls himself the Anonymous Judge. He's caught a member of some worldwide conspiracy. Perhaps it's something big. You think so? Hell, no. You'll never get anywhere like that. - lf it were something big... - lt's about time you acted. You think so? Do you want to be a crime reporter forever? - Are you coming with me? - Call us when you get there. Come on, Fidel. We're going to get the Nobel Prize. The Anonymous Judge promised to hand over the members of an organization that threatens to destroy the values of Western democracy. The police do not know who the Anonymous Judge is nor do they know his motives. How is it possible that a citizen can hand over a criminal, while you, who are paid to do it, can't even write a report about what you're up to? ls a suspect too much to ask for? We're busy trying to solve the case, boss. ''Busy...'' Get to work. That's your last warning. Get out of my office! - You idiot! - lt wasn't my fault. - How could you get caught? - lt was your colleague's fault. - What colleague? - Mike! - ''Mike'' who? - Miguel. - Miguel? - Yes. - He's completely crazy. - ls he alive? He's mad. Talking about conspiracies and Reds and who knows what else. - Are you sure it was him? - l swear. - What did you tell him? - Nothing. - How much does he know? - Nothing, l think. O'Hara's going to come down hard on you. - He's likely to kill you. - Don't be like that, Dominguez. Here. - Take it. - You know l won't say anything. Take it. lt's for your headache. - l'm okay. - You'll need it. lt's to calm the nerves. Thanks. l feel better already. - What else did you tell Mike? - l told him about Rampazo. Hey, Dominguez. My tongue's gone numb. That's because you have just committed suicide. Welcome to ''The Blue Fox.'' We have the most exquisite girls that have come straight from Las Vegas. And the magnificent man of the South: Mr. Mack. And we can't be without the pride of the nation, the Northern singer with her emotional voice: Fatima. Let's get this show started. Show time! - The usual, Jack. - ''The usual''? Have you lost your memory? Don't you remember my face? l'm sorry. l have a bad memory. Of course, Jack. lt was that fight at The Garden. lt was tough, Jack. lt was tough. But you were incredible. 1 5 rounds. 1 5 rounds, Jack. At the end it was only your heart that held you upright. 1 5 rounds! You have a good heart, Jack. 1 5 rounds! - Those were the good old days. - What are you having? Whisky. Keep on being discreet. You don't want to snitch on me. Hey, Jack. She looks like Linda from The Golden Nugget. She had million-dollar legs. When was the last time you saw her? We were separated because of World War ll. The good old times. Bravo! How much do you want to bet How much do you want to bet How much do you want to bet How much do you want to bet That you Iove me just a bit Latin music is becoming more popular, Jack. We're losing our identity. How much do you want to bet that the kisses don"t annoy you And if your cheeks are fIushed it is no fauIt of mine l want to talk to Rampazo. Where's his office? Oh, no. lt's you again. Son of a... We have some unfinished business. Remember? l only remember that they took your badge and threw you in jail. lf it's a job that you want, you can fill out this form. Bring your criminal record, your birth certificate, your identification papers, passport photos... l want to see Red. - ''Red''? - Boris. lt's the first time l've heard his name. And the last time you hear a human voice. Wait! l've got to think. You've got ten seconds. Nine. Seven. - Six. - Six. Right. You've got five seconds. And you're out of bullets. Checkmate. Your time's up. Don't kill me. For your mother's sake. - Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. - Let me live. Don't kill me. Please, don't kill me. Don't listen to them. Don't kill me. He won't leave me alone. Look at him. Look at him! He's a slob. He's a bum, a loser and a gambler. Are you telling me that he's beaten you on many occasions? All over my body. l'm sick of it. Are you cohabiting with the suspect? Well, we live in the same room, but l don't know about co... Hello? He's a wino. He always comes home drunk as a skunk. - They want to talk to you. - l know. On the telephone. - Please calm down. - He's a good for nothing bum. Let go! - l want the judge to know... - Hello? l want it on the record that he is a slob. Did you read my article? Where? l'll be right over. The Anonymous Judge has left the police looking stupid as he has struck once again, handing over another drug dealer to our reporter and proving yet again the inefficiency of our police force. We have to put pressure on this man. Where is Dominguez? He went to see his mother. She's very ill. Nobody is to be permitted leave of absence until this is solved. Open the jail cell. We have to act now. No longer than 72 hours. - This is no time to meditate. - We want names. Dead. Someone is trying to stop our investigation. At the rate we're going, we'll soon be out of men. - lt was necessary, boss. - ''Necessary.'' - Kill that madman, or you're next. - Consider it done. Goodbye, Dominguez. What's up, Chapo? l dropped my key. Who? Me? - What about what l asked you? - l haven't seen him. Perhaps he escaped. We all know how much you like him. So do l. Miguel's got himself in some serious trouble. His friends are the only ones who can help him. You'd better talk. lf anything happens to him, you'll pay for it. - l like him too. - So, tell me what you know. Yes, but... You're not going to like it. Why won't l like it? Well, l have seen him. But nowadays he calls himself Mike. - He's on a big mission. - That's what l told you. - You're not going to like it. - l said that l would. - Tell me. - l'm just warning you. - Where does he live? - You're not going to like it. With your girlfriend. That's why l wouldn't tell you. - With Zoila? - That's what they say. Miguel's all right. Firemen always end up stepping on each other's hoses. Did you forget your keys, honey? What time will he be back? Still can't remember? Where's Red, you stinking rat? No... You thought l'd be easily fooled. You betrayed me. l fought alone, while you were defiling the holy institutions. - Destroying family values. - l'm innocent... - Where's Red? - What are you talking about? All right. He's at Sur 1 25. Oh, my God... - Why did you do it, Frank? - My name is Dominguez. - l'm sorry, Frank. - No! l'm Dominguez! l'm sorry, baby. But you'll get a first-class funeral. - Flooded? - Fell out of the window. - The car, l mean. - Cars don't fall out of windows. Get in line! Get in line! Yes? Yes. Yes. No. No, no. Yes? Yes. Yes. Go and pick up two bodies at Oriente 1 34. Wait! The judge will hand over the mafia boss somewhere else. - Where? - Shall we take your car? Yes, of course, yes. Now Sanchez's done it. The client has asked for a spectacular launch. We should use dark, native looking models. They don't buy anything. They haven't got any spending power. But they're a majority of the population. lt would sell out. l don't think they'd buy a new deodorant. lt's a good idea. We could have two ads. - Yes? - l want to see Red. - You mean Se√±or Ruelas? - He's got many names, eh? - He's in a meeting. - Conspiracy, you mean. You haven't got an appointment. l've had one for a long time. l've got no beef with you, baby. Call head of security. We'll spread the message in this area. We'll bombard the South. - We'll attack the nerve center. - Radio and TV is under control. The East has already been taken. Knock it off! Who are you? l knew this campaign would cause trouble. More than you could imagine. lt's been a long, long time. Sorry to mess up your plans, Red. l've got tough skin. You thought you could get rid of me easily. Don't move. l'll deal with you later. - Please, l've got four children. - Too late, Fatty. Too late. Too late, Fatty. Too late. - l'll blow his head off. - Drop the guns, you idiots. Where are you taking me? To show your true face to the Free World. Not that way. To the roof. No! No! - lt's ten floors down. - With your weight it's fifty. - lt's Mike. - Mike? Mike! - Tell him to bring him down. - Well done, Mike. Well done. Bring him down here. Bring him down, Mike. Tell them you're guilty. Shout it to them! l'm guilty! l'm guilty! Tell them that you poisoned their minds. l've poisoned your minds. Only me. l'm the boss. Don't leave anything out! l'm a drug smuggler. Did you hear? Bring him down, Mike! Goodbye, Fatty. The organization was using an ad agency as a front. Now that the members of the organization have been caught will the people who made that possible get recognition? Listen, Mr. Sanchez. Here we work as a team. The officer will remain anonymous. The reward is that he's done his duty. - On the other hand he'll... - Cool, Mike. Yes, general. Thank you. Yes, Sir. lt's our duty, general. You're very kind. Thank you. Goodbye, general. What do you want? We want to know what's going to happen to Miguel. Mike. He's a good guy. Let him go on working on his own. On his own? But he's crazy. Crazy? - O'Hara? - Yes, boss. Crazy, you say. Take a look at the city. Boris" days were over. I"d taken care of that. I"d done it many times before without feeIing a thing. Not after the first time. After the war you aImost feeI good when you finish off one of the rats that make up mankind. PeopIe can be so stupid sometimes. FoIIowing the Iaw when chasing a murderer. But peopIe wiII aIways want justice. Sometimes they get it, with the heIp of men Iike me. They"re a scourge on mankind, and I"m a scourge on them. WhiIe there are men Iike me, the city can sIeep peacefuIIy. The vaIues of Western Democracy are safe and the Free WorId wiII keep on existing. Just caII me Mike. CALL ME MlKE
