(arrows whooshing) (waves crashing) (thudding) (man laughing) (ominous music) (soft music) (birds chirping) Hi. Hey. It's colder than you'd think. Yeah? Yeah. I believe so. So you can read my mind then? It's colder than it looks I should say. Right. Yeah, I know. I was kidding. Mm. My tongue is sometimes faster than my mind, so. Yeah. There's probably a joke in there somewhere, but not me. Well, I speak a few languages, so sometimes... Yeah. You know, it's funny. I thought I could detect a little, little accent in there. - Yeah? - Yeah. What is it? French, Italian, little German. That would've been my guess, a mix. Then you should've taken it. Fortune favors the bold. Right. Yeah. That's... It's Latin, isn't it. Very good. Good for you. I am a librarian, so... That's gotta be good for something, right. Really? You don't look like a librarian. I'll take that as a compliment, even if it wasn't. You should. I will. I will. So you come around here often, or? Really? I know that sounds super corny, but you know, I, I really don't mean anything by it. Well, actually I do. This is kind of my secret spot. Well, not exactly. I know about it. I mean, from my husband, my family. I come out here to read, relax. Like that makes sense. Sure. No, no, I get it. Well I'm, I'm finished. I'm gonna go. Enjoy. That's... You don't have to, you know, if you're not in a hurry or anything. Thank you. But, I gotta go. It's a lovely beach. Enjoy your day. I'm Marilyn, by the way. Connor. Good name. Thanks. You too. (unsettling music) Can you help me? Sure. What can I do? You again. Yes, it's me. You gotta stop following me. (both chuckling) I'm kidding. How are you? Going all right I suppose. Now that I'm not so sure I can believe. (scoffs) You're very perceptive. It's kind of obvious, the way that you said that. Plus with those on. Oh. If you're gonna say you ran into a door frame, please don't. I won't believe you. I was gonna say cabinet, but I guess you're right. I'm not so okay. I'm really sorry. No, it's not your fault. Well, that's good. Maybe I can be the solution. Maybe. Anyway, I suppose in a way it was you. Um? At the beach. I just took too much time talking to you and I was late getting home, so... Oh my god. I'm so... What? - Connor? When you're done in there, could you come here, please? Take over at the desk? Absolutely. Just a minute, I'm helping somebody here. She's your boss? No, just some old lady. I've been fucking. (both laughing) Exactly what I was imagining, yes. Yeah. - I'm really glad that that's what went into your mind. That's good. Yeah, she's one of several. That you're fucking? No. Bosses. Oh, right. Well, she sure sounds like it. That she does. Anyways, you're here, where I work. How can I help you? You looking for anything particular? Something about murder. Are you serious? To read. I mean, a story about murder. Right? Yeah. Yeah. - Not the act. Not the actual. - No. That's yeah. Yeah. That one. [Boss] Connor? I'm getting the... Cat call from my fuck buddy. So- - No, I know. I'm so sorry. That's my fault. No, please. Don't worry about it. I'd sit here all day and talk to you if I could. - I understand. - Yeah. Anyways, I'll go ahead and take you to the crime section and you can go ahead and take it from there. - Thank you. - Cool. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for up here. Mysteries, thrillers, that kinda thing. It's kind of our bread and butter. What with the name of our town and everything. [Marilyn] What's that? [Connor] Twin Oaks. It's the name of the cafe in The Postman Always Rings Twice. [Marilyn] Oh. [Connor] Trust me. It's a good one. Here we are. Alright. Thank you. No problem. You looking for anything in particular? Not really, something for the beach. The beach. Preferably one where the husband dies. Ah, yeah. One of those, of course. Yeah, don't wanna ruin your reading experience, but just about every other one ends that way, so... - Good. - Yeah. I'll have my pick then. Yes, you will. Um, I should really get back down. Oh, yes. Thank you again. No problem. Take care. It's good to see you again. You too. I feel the same. What's that? I'd like to talk to you too all day if I could. (gentle music) Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Two by Kane. Good choice. - Yes. Hmm. I got a tip from a friend. They seem to have good taste, this friend of yours. I'd trust him from now on if I were you. Hmm. That one looks pretty good too. Yeah. You know, not too bad. Thanks. But we're really not supposed to take any tips. Go ahead. Take it. You sure? I mean, I don't wanna take your last dollar. I insist. Use it. Don't spend it. You understand? (thoughtful music) (door chimes clattering) Oh hey man. Thank you for coming. Really. I'm really sorry. Oh no, please. You cool. You good? Yeah. It's just, you know... (phone vibrates) Shit. I'm sorry. I just had to stay a little later than I thought. No, please. I mean, my time is your time, right? That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying, you know, we had a little extra work Well, I, I kind of think you are. I mean you waltz in here anytime you feel like it all casual. I mean kind of makes a pretty big statement. Sorry. What I meant to say is honestly, I'm late because of my job, which I'm supposed to have, so... (laughs) Um, are you trying to piss me off right now? - No. - I mean is that what you're doing? - No. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Stop. Ow! - Kinda seems like you are. No, no, 'cause if you want me to sit here all day with my dick down your throat, I can definitely do that. - No, that- - No, all you gotta do is say, so. That is not necessary, sir. Oh, I, I like that. The sir thing you just did there, that's not even required, but that shows respect. That's real good. - Thanks. - Well, you're very welcome. But seriously, just let me know if you need me to come out here more often, so you can suck on my cock to help you recall the reason that we need to keep having these little meet ups. What do you think? A fucking asshole. - Yep. - Jesus. Talking like that in a family place. Yep. I know. Hey boys. Hey. Yeah, you were great in Deliverance, by the way. What the fuck's that mean? - Um, it means show me. - What? Show me one family in here, I'll walk over, I'll apologize to 'em. I'll say I am very sorry for using such bad words. Come on, show me. Yeah, that's what I thought. So why don't you go back to eating your $3 breakfast. Stay outta my god damn business. Okay? Yeah. Maybe we don't feel like it, bitch. Oh, is that right? Oh boy. That's really interesting. Okay. See if you can guess what this means. Whoops. You know what that means, what I just did there? That means I'm a state appointed law officer. And I don't like the way you're looking at me or listening in on my conversation over there. Conversation that I'm having with a known felon. Sorry. That's my bad. So take down my badge number. You can write up a complaint, send it off to Providence if you want to. But while I'm here in your... god this is a shitty little candy corn eating town, you'll shut the fuck up and you'll mind your own god damn business. Is that clear enough for you, blubber boy? Yeah. Yeah. I get it. That's great. How are you there, Dumb Shit? [Man In Cap] Yeah. I, I hear ya. That's great. You guys both get gold stars for the day. Pay the bill, meet me outside. (plate clatters) Gee, I hope I wasn't too rude to your cousins in there. No, that was totally fine. You have a real natural charm about yourself. I think you really got through to 'em. Yeah, I felt like we had a real connection going at the end there. Anyway. You okay? You need anything? You got any questions for me? No. Are you sure? You're not fucking up are you? Doing anything stupid, 'cause you know I'll find out. I'm sure. It's the hardest time, first six months of being free. But we got your good job, right? I mean you're not digging ditches. Yeah. I like you Bates. I really do. But don't you ever force my hand. 'Cause I will come down on you like the fucking staff of Moses right across your skull. I swear to god I will. Just so you know. I understand, Sir. See, I really, I really do like that. Keep that up. We're gonna do just fine, you and me. Thank you. See you next week, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. I really don't give a shit about excuses. So you be on time. Or you'll be driving out to see me instead. And I don't believe there's anybody in that whole god damn county who's very eager to see your stupid ass face again. You hear, you hear me? - I do. No, no. Don't touch the car. - Sorry. - Later. Later Jock. Thank you. (engine cranks) (phone rings) Hello? Hello. Hey, it's me, Connor. I did what you asked. I didn't ask you. I told you. Good point. So yeah. Hello. [Connor] Hi there. Where are you right now, at work or at home? Not at work but not at home either. Hm don't tell me you're with her right now. Your boss. Oh yeah. Right. No, I just left her place a while ago. She's exhausting. I can only imagine. God please don't. Now what? I'd like to see you... again. Yes, I figured that much. Yeah. Right. Okay. (laughs) Yeah, so that, yeah. Well I can't right now. I'm with my daughter. Oh. That's, I didn't know you had a daughter. [Marilyn] I don't. [Connor] Okay. Now I'm confused. She's my stepdaughter, but she's here with me. Got it. Okay. And so there's no way you can... None. We're waiting for her father to arrive and I need to be here. And this is the guy, who's been... The bruise. I can't discuss it right now. Understood. Alright. I would like to see you again though, even though I shouldn't. That would be great. Really, really great. Okay, well thank you for calling and I'll let you know. Alright. Yeah. Let me know if you want to set up a time or whatever. (phone clicks) (siren wails) What are you doing here? Sitting. No loitering in the premises. I'm not. Sitting is loitering, son. I was just on a phone call. That's all. Then I'm going for a jog. Is that right? - Yeah. - Park closes at 6:00. I'll be long gone by then. Says you and I don't give a shit what you say. Okay. Shit. I know who you are by the way. Yeah? You hear what I said? Yeah. Don't get smart with me. I'm not. I said, yeah. All right then. And you know who my fucking nephew is, right? Yes I do. So you're a tough guy, huh? No. Yeah. You sure you wanna feel tough? Why don't you try getting tough with me? See what happens. I'm not a tough guy, sir. They got you good, didn't they? Oh yes they did. Yes. They did. Six o'clock be gone. I'll be swinging back by here soon. They lock the gates out front. I know they do. Yeah, you think you know a lot, but you don't know shit, asshole. (sad music) (Connor groans) - Hey Kim. - Yep. I can finish up up here if you want to go do the poetry section. Are you sure? Yeah. It's the other one they want redone today, so... Okay. But that's a lot smaller than up here. That doesn't seem fair. Hey, I'm not always so magnanimous. So grab it while you can. Fine. I'm just gonna go put these. Hey, what are you doing after work? Um... Let me guess, going for a run. Probably. Yep. Geez. You really love it. Don't you? I guess so. It's kind of a habit at this point. You sure you're not out there training for the next Olympics? Yeah. I gave up on that idea in about the eighth grade. I just do it for fun now. I run too. - Do you? - Yeah. Well I, I jog anyway. Oh, that's um, cool. Yeah. We should go together sometime. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be, um, it'd be cool. Yeah. Only if you want to. I know it's nice to run alone sometimes, but I would be up for it. Yeah, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Let's. Cool. (romantic music) Oh, that's uh, what's her name? [Connor] Who? Astrid, I think or something like that. She's in the Pilates class I take and she's kind of a bitch. She's pretty and all that, but she's not very nice. Not to me anyway. That's 'cause you're pretty. Thanks. Yeah, you know, I mean that's like what happens when two pretty girls meet. You know, it's like two tigers in the wild there. Like animals chasing after. Not that I think you're a... An animal. I'm done. You go ahead and take care of poetry and I'll take care of those ladies. That sounds good. And thank you for the compliment. I think. Yeah. Hi. [Connor] Hi. I'm looking for a book about Chanel. Do you have anything like that here? Do you mean the company or the woman herself? Um... Maybe a little bit of both, like a biography? Yeah. I'm doing a paper on her. It's for school. Yeah. We should have something for you in the fashion section downstairs. Would you like me to show you? Great. Um, could you actually go for me please? I just wanna send some emails. [Marilyn] Shouldn't you be doing the work since it's for your class? Please? - Sure. - Thank you. Hey, we need to hurry. Alright? We're meeting your father in an hour at the club for dinner. Gross. I thought you liked eating there. Yeah, I wasn't talking about the club. Hello again. Hi there. I sure am glad we're the only library in town. (laughs) Me too. Your eye looks much better. [Marilyn] You wanna show me where I could find the book? Happy to. Come on down. Hey Kim, I'm gonna show this lady the downstairs. Would you keep an eye on the front for me? Sure. No problem. Great. So this is the lower level. Got our plays, entertainment stuff, all that crap. There's some good stuff too though. Rare books are over there. Mm. I love the smell of old books. Ah, so do I. Believe it or not a million years ago I was an English major, but yeah. Anyways, I'm gonna go take a look for your book. (romantic music) Here you go. Thank you. No problem. It's my job. I didn't mean for the book. (music intensifies) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Connor sighs) (table squeaks) (Connor sighs) I hope to see you again. Oh my god, me too. [Woman] Marilyn. I'm coming. [Kim] So how was your day off? - Yeah, pretty good. - Hmm. [Connor] You know, caught up on some laundry, read some Vonnegut ran, you know. [Kim] Wait, you ran? Shocking. - Yeah, stop. [Kim] Oh hey, guess who I saw yesterday after work? - Who? - Jared Clifton. [Connor] Really? Yeah. I haven't heard that name in a long, long time. Oh I know. And you will never believe who he's going out with. Who? Girl from my Pilates class, Astrid. You know the one you helped her and her mom find the book, they're together. Jared and Astrid. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow. - I know. That's what I've been hearing. And people have seen them around together for a while. And then I saw him pick her up yesterday after class in a really nice car. Wasn't his, I'm sure of it. She's been living here for a while. Apparently her dad is really rich and he had a bunch of houses everywhere. La-di-da, but yeah. That's who she's dating: Jared Clifton. (scoffs) Can you even imagine? I mean he's older than us. Shit. Yep. That's... - What? - Nothing. I mean, who am I to judge? Right? Oh please. Seriously. You're nothing like him. Connor. Okay. You did something and you got punished for it. You're not a complete low life, piece of shit, dick face like him. I mean it, there's a difference. Well, I'm glad you don't have an opinion about the subject. But he is though. And you know that. Do I? Mm hmm. Connor? (suspenseful music) [Marilyn] I was wondering if you'd come or not. Are you joking? You called. So I came. You do like older women, don't you? I can't think about another person since I met you. Yeah? Not even the pretty girl you work with? Kim? That's... No way. You sure? She sure looked interested in you. I'm sure. Not about her liking me. I mean about me liking you. Good. I was jealous. Seriously? That's insane. It's nothing of the kind. Trust me. If you only knew my thoughts. I want you to whisper them to me. (romantic music) (both moaning) (Connor moans) I never want this to end. Me neither. Too bad it's impossible. Is it? Hmm. You know that. You know that. No, I don't. I don't know anything about you. So how could I possibly know that? I'm the same with you. But I love the way you look, the way you are. Thanks. That's... What? Just... Words I haven't heard in a long, long time. Well, I would tell them to you every day, if you were mine. Well I like the sound of that. Of what? Being yours. If only. Because of your husband? Is that really it? 'Cause of that and so much more. It's not just about me. Astrid. I'd be afraid for her. I don't understand. The times that he's hit me, the bruises you've seen, most of them I got trying to protect her. (ominous tones) Oh my god. Fuck that. Fuck that. Turn him in. I mean do it today. I'm serious. It's not that simple. Yes it is. It is that simple. Call the police when you've done something wrong and trust me, things happen really fast. I would know. What do you mean you would know? This isn't about me right now, so. I don't care. You say something like this, tell me. I don't want to let us go. Oh, you won't. Just tell me the truth. Couple years ago, almost four now, I was going to college upstate and I got invited to this family gathering, 4th of July celebration. Yeah, so this is my great uncle who invited me, you know, he lived up by where I went to school. Even though I don't really know these relatives, I figure worst case I get some free food, some booze, you know, fireworks, all that. So. Yeah. I'm up for it. I go. And then, this one guy shows up. Friend of a friend. Kevin Edmunds. Kevin starts picking on this girl. Friend of one of the kids there. And went up to him and I said, "Stop it." You know, stop. And he laughed and he said, "Make me." Just like that. And that was it. I just... I pushed him. Kevin fell back and hit his head on the corner of a concrete drinking fountain on the golf course. He never got up. He didn't die or anything like that, you know. He's had very serious mental, physical. They threw me in jail for three years, three years for pushing somebody. And, you know, obviously by then I had dropped outta school. So I moved back in with my mom, started living in her basement. I got a job at the library because that's just about the only place that would hire me. Yeah. (laughs) Cue the fucking violins. No. (romantic music) Well, you failed. How's that? You failed to scare me away. So when can I see you again? Can I see you again? I hope so. I don't take anything for granted anymore. So, I hope so too. I understand. So? I'll call you, soon, I promise. That's all I can say right now. Well, I guess that's something. Oh shit. You all right? Yeah. No. It's just, my keys. My dad gave me this little key chain when I graduated high school. It's an Indian head nickel. Anyways, the tip of it is broken. So the keys always slip off. And I think they did when we were... I'm sorry. Yeah, it's okay. I mean, I, I would try and help you find it. I just gotta. - Yeah no. Don't worry about, I got it. [Woman On TV] Don't be absurd. Billy's not a criminal. He's the best friend we have on this boat. [Man] We're not in need of such friends. You need any friends you can get. The only thing standing between you and a watery grave is your wits. That's not my idea of adequate protection. Purser, how much longer before this ship reaches port? [Man] If we ever do get to port it should be within 14 or 15 hours. [Man] That's a long time. Sit down, make yourself comfortable. Have a drink. Enjoy the Major's piano recital. Come on, Peterson. Buy us a drink. [Peterson] I'm afraid I can't accept hospitality from persons who I intend in a few hours' time, to denounce. (pensive music) (phone vibrates) Hello? Hi. How are you? (rain pattering) - Hi. - Hi. Hi. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Of course it's something. You're upset. Oh no, it's nothing. My husband called me on the way over here, caught me off guard and started yelling at me. And we started to arguing about nothing like we always do. I fucking hate this guy. I'm sorry. Don't worry. I'm so happy you're here. Me too. (romantic music) We should go. Wait, wait, wait, wait. (Marilyn moaning) (both moaning) Hmm. At least this can be ours. Yeah. How's that? My husband rarely comes here these days. Once he owns something, cars, women, houses, he tends to lose interest. He leaves this to me as my little getaway. You don't like it? I don't like this. I think about us, you, your body, inside of me every second of the day. And I think how's this even possible. How can I want him so much? I feel the same. And yet... Exactly. Maybe he'll leave me. And until then, he'll just keep hitting people, abusing them? Maybe he'll die. Doubt it. Everyone in that man's family lives past 90. Trust me, I checked. People die all the time. That's true. Car accidents, falling down the stairs. All kinds of shit. I'm just saying it happens. Do you think it's fate that we met, you and I? I do. I really do think so. I do too. I've been waiting for this my whole life. My god, you have such a beautiful face. I'm glad you like it. (gentle music) I don't mean to rush you. Yeah, I get it. - We got everything? - Yeah. I really gotta get that thing fixed. You sure you had it when we got here? I think so, but then again, I did take off all my clothes and go in the shower with you. So, I don't really know. It's probably at my house, I think so. And if it's here, you'll just let me know. Okay. Thank you for your understanding. Didn't say I understood. See you soon? Maybe. Why does that sound like goodbye? What? Tell me. Because it could be, Connor. Are you joking? Are you joking? Marilyn? That's crazy. I mean, after what we just did, that's not normal. - But that's just it. It was incredible and you're incredible. But people don't just die or go away. So I can't promise. Marilyn. No! No, that just, it like, it can't, I don't, I don't understand, like please, Marilyn. Fuck! No. - I hope this is not the end for us. I really do. But it could be. (ship's horn blasts) You should go. While you were inside getting lunch, my buddy, Walt, he's the best guy, he sent me this meme. Look at it. It's hilarious. Yeah. It's pretty funny. Hi there. [Connor] Hello again. Hi. So how did your paper go? Oh, it was fine. I gotta B+. So that was pretty okay. Good. Well, glad we had something useful for you. Hey, Kim. Hi. Connor, I think we should probably go. Yeah. Probably. Actually, I'm sorry, I did have a question for you, book question. Okay. I mean I can go and... No, no, that's totally fine. It's totally fine. - Oh. Um yeah. You know, why don't you cover for me now and I'll take the second shift and yeah, I'll figure it out the rest of my break. So would that be okay? - Oh. Sure. - Great. - Sounds good. Have a nice day. - You too. - Bye Kim. [Connor] Thanks Kim. - What's up man? - Nothing. What's up with you? Doing pretty good. Don't you think? Hanging out with these beautiful ladies. So life doesn't completely suck. Wait, do you guys know each other? Oh yeah. Everybody from Twin Oaks knows Connor. (laughs) Well, you're pretty famous around here yourself, Jared. Ah, not like you. This guy made a real name for himself. Huh? Interesting. Not really. Anyways, you had a question about a book. That's the guy I told you about. Yes, the one that you recommended, about the two lovers. Both of the books that you borrowed have two lovers in them. Yeah, well the one that you said was so good, The Postman Always Rings Twice. Okay. I haven't had a chance to read it. I was just wondering, do they get away with it? Do you mean at the end or the crime itself? The crime. Yeah they do. Oh. So it's a happy ending then? Not necessarily. But the husband, he... Yeah, he dies. (phone vibrates) Hello? That was torture today. Yeah. I agree. Did you ever find your keys? No, it's not my keys. It's the little part that connects to the end, but no, it'll turn up, it always does. Mm. I hope so. You said it was a keepsake. (ship's horn blasts) Are you, are you okay? Has something else happened? That means yes. Fucking piece of shit. It could have been a happy ending. I'm sorry. You mean us? What you asked me about today in the book? Would a turned out just fine if they stuck together, but they didn't. They turned on each other and fucked everything up. Everything would've been fine if they just saw it through. What are you saying to me? You know what I'm saying to you. Tell me, say it. That... if we do this, then it's forever. And I mean for all times, does that make sense? Yes. And? I agree. It's forever. Okay. Alright, good. I'd do anything to be with you. So will I. I'll be at the cottage tomorrow. (phone clicks) I'm taking Astrid to Boston next week for two days, shopping trip he promised us months ago. [Connor] Interesting. Well, if he keeps his word, which is not always his strong suit. That happens often? More often than I'd like. Which means a lot. If this does happen, where will he be? At the house. Which one? (scoffs) True. Out on the point. Any alarms? Nuh uh, no alarms. He doesn't believe in them. He sleeps with a gun under his pillow, wherever he goes. Makes him feel like a big man. Got it. Is this really happening? Unless you told me to stop it this instant, then yes, it's going to happen. Tell me it isn't for the money. His money. If it is, even partially for it, lie to me and tell me it isn't. Of course it isn't. You don't even have to think about it? - No! - Not even for a second? It seems like he's got a lot of it. He does millions and millions, but not for me. I, I don't understand. Well, I mean, some of it will come to me as a monthly stipend, but you know, the bulk of his estate goes to Astrid. I'm just the executor until she turns 25 and, then it's all hers. Did I say something wrong? Are you having second thoughts? About you? Never. I'm doing this for us and I'm not gonna think twice about it. (ominous tones) I don't want to know anymore about him ever. Never again. What I know is the way he treats you and her. And that's enough for me. Yes. It's gonna happen while you're in Boston. And when it does, we'll be free. (romantic music) (rain pattering) I should go. I don't want you to. Soon I won't have to. We shouldn't talk for a while. I don't know for how long, but until we both know it's safe. I understand. If anybody ever asks you, any phone call we ever had is about work. I gave you my numbers so that you could ask me about authors or I could provide you with information. Yes, I'll do that. Good. There's a sun room of the side of the house, the door doesn't lock. We're supposed to leave on Tuesday. Then have a nice trip. There's one more thing I need you to do. I need you to go to a drug store. And I need you to buy one of those burner phones. If anything happens while I'm gone, you can text me. That way I'll know you're in trouble or you need something. When you use it, text me one word, text me the word books and I'll know. And I'll get to you somehow, I promise you. But do not call me, text me. And I will meet you at the parking lot of the woods where we met, okay? [Marilyn] Okay. You do that and I promise you, I will get to you no matter what it takes, okay? At least we'll be together. Do you understand? Nothing's gonna happen, alright? Don't say it. You'll jinx it. Will you promise we'll be together? I promise. (unsettling music) Hello there. What's up? That'd be my next question. Isn't that weird. Where you been all day? Good to see you too, Deputy. You don't wanna get smart right now. Smart asses get read their rights while I hold their stupid fucking faces down against the hood of my car. Do you see the way this guy talks to me? Just answer the question. I was out. It's my day off. Out? Where? Running. Running? All day long? Yeah. And whatever. What is this? Eh, maybe something, maybe nothing. We've had a series of break-ins the last few weeks. Last night we had three. And you're asking me because? Because you're a convict and you live here. We're talking to anybody with a record, so... I see. [Deputy] I bet you do. Take it easy, please. He's got no priors when it comes to stealing or breaking and entering. He's been to prison. Yeah. So has Martha Stewart. You check on her whereabouts yet? You piece of shit! Come on. Relax. Okay. You got nothing, right? Because you have an alibi for last night. Don't you? Yeah. What is it? Dinner, with my mom, until late. What is going on? How late? One or two. We watched some movie on TCM. The Lady From Shanghai. Where is she? In Shanghai I presume. Fuck you. Your mom. Oh, my mother. At work, at the hospital. Call her. Why didn't you answer my calls today? When? Oh, check your phone. Check your phone. Six. It's off. Oh, keep that shit on from now on. Do you hear me? I don't like driving here anymore than I have to. Whether it's bullshit or not. God, I keep giving you chances. You keep dicking 'em up. I'm sorry. Okay. We should go. Can we go? I'll see you soon for breakfast. Don't be late. (engine cranks) Anyway, blah, blah, blah. Enough about me. No, I'm interested. (laughs) No, you're not. I wish you were, but you're not. You keep looking around, checking your phone. It's like your mind's not even here. That's not true. Isn't it though? I mean, yeah. I'm a little distracted, but I'm interested. But not actually like I am. What do you mean, Kim? Like I am in you. Oh. Right. Oh. Anyway. Change of subject. Why tonight? I've asked you out a couple of times, well, not out out, but for a run. Whatever. Why now? Why dinner? No reason. Just, and we don't have to do that, by the way. You know, change the subject. I just, I didn't know that you felt that way about me. You know, I thought we were just friends or something. We are, but Connor, come on. You know what I'm talking about, I know you do. Kim. Look, I love being friends with you. I need friends. Seriously. I think you're amazing, but- - No. - I just. I get it. Yeah. Would you excuse me for one minute? (suspenseful music) (floor creaks) (floor creaks) (stair creaks) [Intruder] Whoa. Oh my god. Dammit. (door closes) (laughs) You look such a little... No, I couldn't sleep. So I walked down to the marina. (sighs) Okay, yes. The bar down by the marina. What? No, I keep ours on the Cape. Come on. You know that. No, I just... Yes. A couple of drinks. And now I'm back. So tell Daddy goodnight and go to sleep. Yes. I said yes. It's true. I'll see you soon. Yes. (laughs) Good night. (floor creaks) (tense music) (men grunting) (gun clicks) (Connor grunts) You are dead, mother fucker. (gun clicks) So I hope to God that it was worth it. (thudding) (husband grunts) (suspenseful music) [Connor] Sit the fuck down. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Sit the fuck down. Wait, wait, dude, it's me. It's me, it's me, it's Jared. Jared! What the fuck are you doing here? Same thing as you, man. What do you think? Tell me. Dude, I'm fucking breaking in and stealing shit. Bro, don't point that thing at me. Who told you to do that? Your little fucking girlfriend? No, no dude. I mean, she hates her old man and she showed me all the shit that he owns. But dude, I've been doing this all over the fucking town. I can't help it. It's what I do. That's not what I fucking asked you. That is not what I asked you. Okay, I was, I was, I was up here and I heard someone come in, so I fucking hid. And then I heard you two fighting. So I came in here and he was... Bro, he was about to shoot, I saved you. Can you not point that thing at me please? (gunfire pops) (gunfire pops) (Connor pants) Fuck. Oh fuck. Okay, okay. Take this shit. Where the fuck is my mask? I'm okay. Okay. Oh fuck. Where's my fucking mask. Shit. Where the fuck? Oh fuck. Shit. (glass shatters) Fuck! Fuck! (glass shatters) Fuck! (glass shatters) (door slams) (unsettling music) Yes, the roadblocks are up. We're watching the railroad station and he isn't hiding in the woods. (phone vibrates) [Marilyn] Hello? Connor? Connor. You there? (ominous tones) What did I say about calling me? I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize, but what did I say? Not to. That's right. And now you did. I'm on the phone that you made me get. It's not what I said. It's not what I said. I said, don't call me on this phone period. And now you did. You know why I said that. Because it's dangerous. More than that because it's the type of thing that you can get you caught. Well, you've done it now anyway. So go ahead. He's dead by the way, if that's what you're wondering. Is it? - No. - Really? I, I just wanted to, I needed to know that you're okay, that you're alive. Okay. Well, why wouldn't I be? I don't know. I just, you're just really horrible to me right now. Maybe that's because I just killed somebody four hours ago. Maybe that's why, I don't know. He'll be found soon if he hasn't been already. Nobody's contacted you yet? No. All right. Then there's still time. Before what? Before the world comes busting down on our heads at 10,000 miles per hour, Marilyn. Why was he there? Because I told you that he'd be there. It's his house. Not talking about your husband. I'm sorry. I, I don't follow what you're saying. I was there and he wasn't. Then he saw me. We ran upstairs, we struggled for the gun. He won it. He was gonna shoot me dead. But he didn't. Do you know why, Marilyn? No. Because someone else was there. Jared Clifton, your stepdaughter's boyfriend. Are you joking? Why would I joke about something like that? Well, I don't know. He said he was just breaking in and stealing some shit, that it was all just a coincidence, But that's a pretty huge fucking coincidence, don't you think? So tell me it was just that. Coincidence. Nothing more. It was, Connor. Are you actually saying that I could possibly... I don't know, but her boyfriend and your boyfriend both broke into the same house on the same night and one of us killed your husband, which is awfully fucking convenient. I really don't like what you're saying. Well all I know is that Jared Clifton was there and he saved my life. And then I shot him. What? Yeah. Why not? It's the perfect alibi. I mean, your husband's gone. The answer to our problems was just sitting there on his knees. So I did it and I made it look like they killed each other. That was my night. How was yours? Shopping was good? I don't know what to say to you right now. Tell me that you need me. Tell me that it was worth it. It was. Okay. Fine. Then go back to bed and do not call me again. Text me if you really need something, be ready to lie your ass off for the next two months. I love you. I love you. You promise? I promise. (somber music) (door opens) Ah, see now this is more like it, you waiting for me. Yes, Sir. Boy. Yes, Sir on top of it. This is my fucking lucky day. Yours too from the sound of it. How's that? Oh, come on. You must a heard. Heard? The little fuck who murdered the rich guy over on, out on the water there, Jared Clifton, whatever his name is. Whole firestorm was bad. Went down out there last night, shooting and stabbing, all kinds of shit. Guy took a fire poker to the back of the head and still managed to kill the perp. How the hell does that work? Huh? Anyway, solves the break-ins they've been having around here, which is why I said it was, well that's pretty good for you. Yeah, I see. Yeah, yeah, no. I heard something about it at work. Terrible. Crime doesn't pay. Right? That's what they say. They're right too. You already know that though, don't you Bates? - Sure do. - Yeah. What's with your neck? What'd you do, cut yourself shaving? - Oh this? - Yeah. Yeah, no, I, you know. What's that? You know? I was, I was, you know, tree. Oh, you're still running. - Yeah. - Right. You still getting to work on time? Still driving that piece of shit car? Yep. Doing it all. Living the life. Mm hmm. Hey, is there anything you wanna tell me? - No. - Hey, are you sure? 'Cause I'm here, I'm listening. Listen, I'm, I'm really pulling for you. No, I'm, I'm good. Really. - You're you're good? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's eat. Huh? Guess who's buying? You. Miss. (suspenseful music) (Connor shudders) (romantic music) (siren wails) [Man on TV] No one could possibly getaway with an act like that. They'd be wise to me in a minute. Don't be yellow. You look enough like him, the same coloring and the same build. See how his clothes fit you. No kidding. You almost had me fooled for a while. [Man On TV] Oh, grow up girl. Don't you think a father knows his own son and there must be other relatives. [Woman On TV] The father won't have to know you. We'll wait 'til he gives up the ghost. He's an old geezer and he won't pull through. (tense music) (music overpowers voices) Whoa, where you going, son. For a run. This early, with a bag? Yeah. I got work after. What's, um? Look, I'm not supposed to be here. Okay? They agreed to let me talk to you for a minute or two. So please just don't do anything stupid. Okay? - Okay. Okay. Hey please. I'm asking you nicely now. Yeah, no I'm, I'm listening. I'm listening to you. Alright, they got you solid on this. Okay, there's no reason to make it any worse than already is. They know, eh don't, they know somebody else was there. They got blood under a fingernail. Not from one of the victims it's blood that matches yours. Okay? A lot of valuables missing. Stuff not on the body of the dead perp. So hey, they know that you two were working together. Okay? Whoa. I have no idea what you're talking about, man. That's crazy. - Bates, please. Okay. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but yeah, I'll come with- (bag thuds) (tense music) God dammit. Bates! Bates! (siren wails) (no dialogue) (tires squealing) (sirens wail) (Connor winces) (Connor sobs) Bates, these people will kill you. They are itching to do it. I am begging you now. - Oh no. Get down on the ground and stop this shit. Now god dammit, do it son. Just listen to me. Alright? Just listen. What have you done? Well I don't. I don't. What do you mean? How did you know that I was gonna come here? If you didn't... How could you possibly know? How? - We got a tip, okay? Anonymous caller. Some lady. Don't lie to me. I don't understand what you're saying. She told us right where you'd be. I, I don't believe you. Get down on the fucking ground now. Gimme a second. Please. One second. Very fidgety. Okay? Just do what they say, please. Nothing you're gonna regret. I can't. Alright, listen to me. They have your key ring. Alright? Or a piece of it. The little Indian coin. They have it. My, my key chain? Must have dropped it at the scene or it broke or something. I don't know. They have it. They found it in the house. Oh no, no, no, no. - Bates. - That's not, that's, that's, that's not possible. No. I'm telling you that they do. That's... They have it. Let's not make this any worse than it is. Hey, just get down. Get down. Okay. Okay. Bates. Get down. (phone vibrates) (tense music) No, just get down. Don't answer that. [Connor] I have to. Hey! Bates, no! Bates, no! (gunfire pops) No! Bates! Bates, don't! (gunfire pops) Bates! Put your gun down. (birds squawking) Bates? Bates? (police radio garbling) He's gone. (water crashing) Hello. Hi. How was the water? It's colder than you think. Did you steal this? I didn't return it. It's different. Ah, what happens at the end? I don't know. I didn't finish it. (romantic music) That's what I've always wanted for us. The minute we met. You and me together. Me too. It's like a dream. Now it's real. No one will ever come between us ever again. I love you. I love you too. You promise? I promise. (dramatic music)
