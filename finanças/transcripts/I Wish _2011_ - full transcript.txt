Thanks for breakfast! A light rain is forecast in the mountain areas this afternoon. The entire Kagoshima area will become cloudy in the afternoon. The southern island chains will remain sunny all day. The wind forecast over Sakurajima... This is the moon. This is the wind. What's this? Erm... A snake? What do you mean, a snake? Hey Koichi, what's this? A ghost? Mum, I need the school fees for October. You're right, I forgot! This is a ghost. Dry your hair before you come home. But that's the best part. But summer's over. You could catch a cold. - Off you go! - What's this, then? Sorry! You're late, Koichi. Sorry. I was cleaning my room. Cleaning? Yeah, the volcanic ash. Doesn't it bug you? Not anymore. The ash from Sakurajima is used in that famous baseball stadium. - Eh? Really? - They do. You know everything. - I don't get it. - What? Why's everyone so calm when the volcano's erupting? You should've moved to Fukuoka with your little brother. I WISH Why'd they build this school at the top of a hi‚Äù? I don't get it. Morning! Good morning! Why'd they build this school at the top of a hill? Morning. I wish she was our form teacher. Yeah, I know. - Mitsumaru? - Yes, sir. - What did you write? - I wrote "Exile". Is "Exile" a profession? I'm asking you again. Is "Exile" a profession? It's the name of a pop group. - Yes. - Sit down. I asked you what kind of job you want in the future. I can understand "professional baseball player". But "Ichiro" isn't a profession. Right, then! Before next class, go and find out about your fathers' jobs. You'll need to submit your papers. Got that? - Teacher? - What? Osako doesn't have a father. I see. You don't have a father, Osako? I do, but we're living apart for now. Anyone else without a dad, raise your hand. He's violating our privacy. If you don't have a father, then write about your mother. I'm going to tell my mother and have our teacher fired. Go for it. Cheer up, eh? I asked about your profession. Are insects a profession? - What did you write? - Rhinoceros beetle. - No wonder he's mad. - Take it easy, Tasuku. He really pisses me off. Osako! So you moved back in with your mother's folks because of your family situation? Yes. Actually, I didn't have a father either. Hang in there. Come and talk to me anytime. I'll support you. Don't you want to move back to Tokyo, Tasuku? Not really. It's not like living in Tokyo was that much fun. Besides, we've already moved three times. I'm used to it. Ryunosuke, did you hear about the Tower of the Sun? What? It's under "administrative re-evaluation". It was on the morning news. It's going to be torn down? Yeah, bet they'll get rid of it this year. The four of us went to the Tower of the Sun park a lot. Yeah, but Dad and Mum were always fighting. But Osaka was a whole lot better than this dump. Are the ashes still falling? Yeah, they make a really loud noise when they fall. I don't get it. I don't get it, either. My shoe! OCTOPUS PUFFS Step right up! I want ponzu scallions with fish flakes and sauce. How many? Ten each. Aren't mine better than the ones in Osaka? Not necessarily. 700 Yen. Give me a discount. If you don't, I'll have the shop re-evaluated! That's scary. Bye-bye. See you tomorrow! I'm ho me! In two months, the Bullet Train will start running throughout Kyushu. Once operational, the Kyushu Bullet Train will connect Kagoshima and Hakata, at top speeds of 260kph, drawing wide regional interest. Oh, it says, "A lively place for workers in their 203." What is that, age harassment? Why can't they just write, "Not hiring workers in their 303." I'm too old to work a cash register. What if my old classmates shop there... If only your father made a little more money, we could support you two, but he's just about retired. Thanks for dinner. He left his cabbage again. It's so delicious. Maybe he doesn't like the crunch. Ryu doesn't like cabbage either. I hope he's eating properly. I told you, I'm happy to take in both of them. He made his own decision. It's been six months now. I'm sure he's missing his mother about now. I'm sure he is, I know he is. He is, he is. That night, I had a dream. In the car... We got on the bus, and then Koichi took off his helmet and all this steam came out. Steam really came out. I was surprised. Amazing. Sounds like a manga. Wait! I wonder if the four of us will ever live together again. FUKUOKA Dad! Time to go to the work! Did you come up with a new song? Something like this... Try going back to sleep. Yeah. I'm off! - Good morning! - Morning! Morning! Morning! My school bag's so heavy. It's light. I'm borrowing your hat, keep this. Not fair. Dragonfly! You idiot. Damn, I can't catch it. Almost! I just had it. Its wings flapped and it got away. Ryu, your bag! He ignored me. Not listening. Today's lunch is fried bread. You like it? It's awful. It's not awful. Morning! Morning! - I saw you on TV last night. - Thanks. - What's Becky like? - She's really pretty and sweet. - Actually, have you ever met Ono? - No. If you do, get his autograph. I like Nino. - You're out of luck. - Why? There aren't going to be two actresses in one class. Yeah, but I'm not all that serious about acting. You really want to, right? But the two guys in "Downtown" were in the same elementary school class. - They're comedians. - Yeah, comedians are different. I don't know... Morning. The ash is really falling today. I want to talk to you about something. Can I come over tonight? Not like the last... No. I'm sure this one will work out. I'll bring the booze. This is the equipment we used in the experiment. We decided to make the soap bubble liquid using kitchen detergent, laundry detergent, washing powder and soap. Did you try using shampoo? You have to use shampoo for soap bubbles. I'll tell you a secret. The Sakura train runs at 260 km from Kagoshima. The Tsubame train runs at 260 km from Hakata. It happens when they first pass each other. What does? - A miracle - A miracle? Because of the intense energy, whoever sees it, their wish will come true, just like a falling star. Hey, is that really true? Yeah. Demizu, Mizumata, Tosu, Yatsushiro... Kurume... They'll pass each other around here. Kumamoto Prefecture. Are you planning a trip? - Yes. Where to? Kumamoto? The horsemeat sashimi is delicious there. She's barefoot. She's not barefoot, she's barelegged. Barelegged... It's here. Did you feel something down here? What? She's gone. There was a granny there. Time travel? Amazing. Yeah, amazing. Maybe my wish will come true with the Bullet Train. Yeah. What's administrative re-evaluation? You can eat the crumbs. Not potato chips. What's administrative re-evaluation? That's kind of sudden. It's for homework. It means "it's a waste, so cut it out". Mum said the same thing to you, didn't she? Listen, there's room in this world for wasteful things. Imagine if everything had meaning. You'd choke. But you can't just have waste. I said, you can't just have waste. That's when we went out drinking, and I wound up joining the Highdeckers. And 15 years later, I'm back in town, making music. Welcome back! I'm home. What about the good beer we keep for guests? Once you're drunk, they all taste the same. No matter how much you drink, it all comes out as pee. After they go home, the toilet's sopping wet. I wonder if it screws up their aim... Tell them to sit down! We have to clean up their mess. You're right. How are things? They look tasty. Karukan cake's old fashioned. My grandkids won't touch it. When I told my son's wife about Karukan cake, she'd never heard of it, she asked if it was cat food. Don't... Even Japanese sweets are all healthy nowadays, and the young girls are crazy about them. I think if we have a new hit product, our shopping arcade can come back to life and beat out the one at the station. It's two months 'til the Bullet Train comes. You think sponge cake will do the trick? But, you know those caramels from that ranch up north? They've got stores throughout Japan, employing thousands of people. Oh, that's "melting, melting". Right, "Melting Ranch". A ranch won't melt. Nozomi! What do you think? They became a hit because the owner is a comedian. Yeah, that's what I think. Yama! - Are you OK? - He's woozy. I closed up shop 5 years ago. I'm getting old. It won't be the same... The taste doesn't matter. Name it "Bullet Train Sponge Cake", or shape it like a Bullet Train. We'll melt it then. Call it "Melting Sponge Cake". I'll melt... Sit down and do it. Just like him... At 250 km an hour It runs like it flies Vroom, vroom, vroom It runs Vroom, vroom It runs The Super Express Blue Light At 250 km an hour It runs like it glides I don't get it. What? What's wrong? Nothing. I need a favor. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's your purchase. Thanks. My grandson kept begging me for these. Thank you. Thank you for visiting the store. I could have had them delivered. - I was just out taking a walk. - Your father? He rarely comes to the store. Goes fishing nearly everyday. Why do they live so close to a volcano? What? I don't get it. Why ashes fall. Eruptions are proof the mountain's still alive. It's alive, so it has to let off energy once in a while. It's letting off too much. But you know... But... There sure are a lot more buildings around. If there was a huge eruption now, everyone in the whole area would have to move. It goes ba-boom and then rumble-rumble. Isn't that a great idea? Yeah, it is. Gee, you're cold. C'mon. For the four of us to live together again, I can't be the only one doing all the work. I know that. - It's ba-boom, rumble-rumble. - That's right! Hey, how's Dad? He's not dating anyone, is he? You be on the lookout, OK? That's why you moved to Fukuoka with him. Don't worry. He's the same-old Dad. Cut it out. Shoot, someone's with you. You sound like you're having fun. Friends, just friends. Thanks! Hey, what's ba-boom? That's a secret with my brother. You can tell me. Ba-boom is just ba-boom! Wow! So pretty! Amazing. It's pink. I lost. I won. You already lost. Not like that. Forget it. Nice, nice. Elegant dance. Reminds me of Africa. - You went to Africa? - Sure did. Fireworks! What shall I wear? To your reunion? It's just 4 or 5 of us going to Karaoke. Is that guy, Kubo, coming? You be careful now. They say it's all the rage. Rekindling love at reunions. What's kindling? It's rekindling, not kindling. Rekindling? Rekindling. You don't need to know what it means yet. - Here. - Thanks. Doesn't he have a phone? No. And I won't answer if he calls. I wonder how Ryu is doing. It seems like he's having fun. He always took after his father from when he was little. And he's growing vegetables in the garden. Oh, no. I'm sure that's... You know the stuff that musicians use these days... Oh, no, no. I need you to hang out with me later. What for? It's just... I need to dump the molten lava. Did you know about the new club that opened up? No. It's Karukan cake. Karukan cake. Karukan cake, huh? - How old are you? - 61. 80 young. Young. 78 Yen. 415 Yen. 248 Yen. Hold on. You're making Karukan cake? You're so sweet. Just like this? They're long, they'll stick out. It's OK. Hello. Oh, welcome. Six bags of granulated sugar. Certainly, thank you. Paper, scissors, rock. Paper, scissors, rock. I want to be a professional baseball player. On the line-up now? Who do you want to be like? Ichiro. I want to hit like Ichiro does. Ichiro always has curry for breakfast. So I eat curry for breakfast, too. Curry? Every morning? What's that got to do with it? I don't know, probably not. Promise not to tell? Marry Teacher Sachi, the librarian. She's way too much older. I know that, but... A player on the Hawks team married his classmate's mother. She's a lot older. That's not a miracle... I wish Sakurajima would go ba-boom, rumble-rumble, and have a gigantic eruption like never been before so we can't live here anymore, and the four of us can go back to living together in Osaka. Hey wait a minute. That means we all die. Run away. What's your little brother's wish? The same thing as you? Probably... It's small and dirty. We don't care! How small is it? I'm not sure. Hello Ma'am. How unusual, to bring friends home. We're having an important meeting. And you brought guys along. You rock, Megumi. Her eyes, just like her mum's, are irresistible. I'll kill you. What's so important? A miracle. Don't tell. Get in here. I told you it's tiny and dirty. I used to believe in miracles, too. She doesn't even believe in Santa Claus anymore. What would you wish for, if you could? Let's see... I'd like to start life over from 20 years old. If I'd worked a little harder in Tokyo, I wouldn't be entertaining drunks like you, here. Cruel, too cruel. Paper, scissors, rock! Paper, scissors, rock! I hate studying more than anything. Remember when they had "Relaxed Education" before? That "Relaxed Education" is gone now. But I want Relaxed Education to come back. And for homework to go away. I wish I could paint beautiful pictures without working hard at it. You know Bayblade, the top? I only have 3 right now, and I want a lot more. When I get more of them, I want to rebuild them and become the best Blader in the world. I do realise it's a totally ridiculous wish. - Very childish. - Yes, childish. Another wish? What else... What do you want to be when you grow up? When I grow up? I haven't thought that far. Megumi, you want your rival, Yuna, to go away, right? Yeah, I want to beat her. She's nice. That's what's hard. You can't badmouth her. Hey guys, here! Thanks! Thank you. Don't come up. This is secret. Don't be mean, I brought you these. Thank you. Megumi looks like her mum. She really does. Your mum used to be an actress, right? A long, long time ago. Before I was born. Why'd she quit? I don't really know. Maybe she quit because I was born. When I grow up... I want to be a Masked Rider from TV. But that's... You can't be. I like him, so I want to try being him. But I want to try something else, so I can't decide. What? When I grow up I want to drive a super car. What does your older brother... What miracle does he want? What's his wish? He wants the four of us to live together. Apparently, that's his wish. That's not your wish? No... You have to! That night, I had a dream. What do you mean, you quit your job? Oh, well, I'll find another one. How many times have you said that? Like I said... Like you said, what? We have two children. You still act like a student. When things get tough, you shut up. Say something! Say something! Who cares about your T-shirt! Calm down! What's going on inside your head? Ryu! - What's going to happen? - Don't throw food. I can't take anymore of that. Grate it in circles. That's right. It won't pile up today. How is it? Meaning? How does it taste? Taste? Isn't it sweet? It's only faintly sweet. Faintly? Slightly. What you mean is, mellow. Yeah, mellow... It smells good. The flavour's faint. I think it's missing something. It doesn't taste like it used to. I used granulated sugar this time, to intensify the sweetness. Oh, is that why? I wanted to give it a try. - This isn't half bad. - Right? Nobody else can tell the difference. Do you know the name of the new Bullet Train? - It's "Sakura", the cherry blossom. - That's right. You need a Sakura theme to your sponge cake. A Sakura theme? Dye the filling pink, like Sakura. You can't see that from the outside. No, you have to dye the outside pink. That's impossible. Pink is impossible. In that case, forget I ever brought it up. Oh, no... Tea. What's wrong with dying a sponge cake pink? Everyone knows Karukan cake is white. As a craftsman, there are some compromises I just cannot make. In these hard times, who can afford not to compromise? If I make it that way, how can I face my guardian angel, Tajima? Who's more important, Tajima or your sweet daughter and grandkids? Tajima... Hey there. Won't your mum get mad for calling me? What are you talking about? If you keep quiet, she'll never know. You've got a point. How's everyone doing? We're all doing fine. But the thing is... What? What happened? If you want to get back together, better not wait. What's that supposed to mean? Does your mum have a boyfriend? So you want to know? Then ask her yourself. You know I can't do that. Don't we matter to you anymore? That's not true. But... I want you to grow up to become someone who cares about more than just your own life. What's that mean? For instance, music, or the world... What's the world? I don't get it. You will, soon enough. When's soon enough? When is soon enough? Too bad. About the Karukan cake. But if you had dyed it pink, it wouldn't be yours. Did you feel a little something, in here? Yeah, I did. We've still got what it takes. Do kids today feel something about anything? Because the brakes stop working... Sometimes Cat Ear brakes come out. Not the Cat Bus, but Cat Ears. Cat Ears, I see... Are you giving up? Yeah. Why? Because I'm sick of it. But you started the whole idea. Miracles don't happen, anyway. You should practice baseball more. Instead of relying on curry. And Koichi, you should just get used to it. To what? Ichiro is eating udon noodles now, not curry. It doesn't matter. I think it's for the best. "Your" miracle‚Äù was kind of selfish. Selfish? I wished the volcano would have a huge eruption, so the four of us could live together again in Osaka... I know that... I know that, but... Mum's started working again and we're in a crisis. But I planted vegetable seeds last month, and they'll ripen in the spring. Not vegetables again! Do you care more about your vegetables than your family? You're just like Dad. Mum said it, too. You were just like Dad from when you were little. What am I supposed to do? Forget it. Have fun where you are. You OK? Don't you worry. We're brothers. But you haven't seen him in a long time. We're connected by a thread you can't see. That's no good. Things are fine. Even family will forget you if you don't see them, someday... I'll join them. Me, too. Me, too. You're in the way. She's dancing. That other girl is drinking, too. Why'd I get stuck with this thing? How is it, Yuna? I'm fine, thank you. See you later. It starts dancing in your mouth That cute girl drinks it, too Plenty of raw milk and bananas Great, great, let's do it again. Let's go. What's wrong, Marble? Are you tired? You're so old... I'm going home. See you! Hang in there! Thank you. See you! See you. Hello. Hello, Mum? I'm eating cabbage... I hear you're having fun. I'm trying hard so we have fun. Listen, Ryu. Don't you want to see your mother? Of course I want to see you. In that case, why can't you say you want to see me? You think I'm just like Dad, so I thought maybe you don't like me. Listen, Ryu... You know that's not true. If that's what you really think, just come over here, now. That's not really it. What is it, then? I planted fava beans last month. Now they're 4 cm tall. Next spring, they'll ripen. When they do, I'll send you some. You always used to eat fava beans with your beer. And fava bean rice. That was delicious. I like it. Yeah? Thanks. Ryu? Listen. I'll teach you how to make it. Then you can eat it anytime. What, hey... Ryu, this is your grandma. No matter what happens with your parents, you're my own blood. You're my grandson, OK? Sure. I'll send you a big bag of your favourite sweets... Hey, that doesn't matter. Put his mother back on the phone. - Look. - What? A ticket to the very first Bullet Train. Lucky you. I heard my dad got it from someone he knows. Lucky you. We have to go to Kumamoto. Even if there's no miracle, the three of us have to go. I want to go, too. These, please. This is yours, right? You're right. Where'd you find it? In the courtyard. You figured out it was mine? I liked the sound of this bell, so I'm happy. Thank you. I like the sound of that bell, too. Why'd you borrow that old book? How much for snacks? In order to get there, round-trip fare for two, I mean for three, is 12,240 Yen. What else? Oh, we need money for food. We have to add that in. They should pass each other at 6:40. It leaves at 6:00... I hope they pass each other. I found 10 Yen! Great! I found one! 100 Yen! I have a lot of action figures at my house. Especially a lot of Ultraman. We could sell those. And sell books. Yeah, books! I've got lots. One, two, three, four... This is everything. Do you have a letter of consent? - Consent? - We don't have it. Your guardian needs to fill out their name and address and sign this form... Shoot What to do? This is bad... If we want to catch that train, we have to leave class in the middle of the 2nd period. But if we tell him, the teacher will figure it out, so the key is how to slip out of class, without him noticing. Excuse us. This is worth 5,000 Yen. (f' And this is also 5,000 Yen. Great! Do we have anything else to sell? Not Marble, he's family. We're just joking. You're unbelievable. Oh, it's Kawashiri. That's how you read it. What do we do? What about swimming? Now, we have enough. 22,000. 23,000. 24,000. 25,000... That will be 4,080 Yen per child to Kawashiri for a total of 12,240 Yen for three tickets. 12,240 Yen. Twelve... thousand‚Äù. Two hundred and forty Yen. Wait, wait, wait! They're all gone. These crumbs are the best. What if we write in our notebooks, pretending our mums are excusing us from 2nd period? If we leave early, he'll figure it out. And our handwriting's too bad. That might work. I think a headache is good. Hello. Hello. Sorry about the other day. Can I come to Kumamoto, too? What for? I think our family should all live together. That's sudden. Two is better than one, to communicate my feelings, I mean, my wishes. That's true, but it costs money. From your end about 2,500 Yen. Ad lib from here. Money we have. What about school? That day's a half-day. It's been six months. Hope I recognise you. Don't be stupid. I didn't change that much. I changed a lot. I can even eat cabbage now. That's amazing. And I can swim 400 meters breaststroke style. And butterfly? Not so much... I'll teach you how. That'd be great! Leave it to me. I'm home. You shouldn't have waited up for me. Listen up, Dad, have a seat. What? What's this all about? I act like I'm having fun, but since you and Mum split up, I've put up with a lot. Well, I'm... sorry for what I'm putting you two through. In that case, you're going to have to put up with things, too. Yeah. You get child support, right? Could you give me half of that? Oh, no. Put up without a new guitar until next month. Oh my, my, my... What? Finish your homework? Yeah. Then go to bed. I want to buy a dress for my audition. You have your white one-piece. It's the same as Yuna's. It's a movie, filming in Tokyo. Tokyo... isn't such a nice place. How can I know if I don't go? Don't get sassy just because someone scouted you. You serious? I'm serious. You can't pull it off. Why not? You're too sweet. Are you passionate enough to get ahead and beat Yuna in the audition? I am. No, you aren't. Not even close. It doesn't matter, but that's what it takes to succeed as an actress. But I am. Hey, Grandpa. Your greeting? - I'm home. - Welcome home. Say... What's up? Need a favor? How can you tell? You've been living with us six months now. Allowance? No. Frozen beans don't taste very good. The beans just fall apart. Teach me how to simmer them. It's easy. Just simmer them with soy sauce and sake. You added something else. Oh, poppy seeds. Poppy seeds! "To be Alive" by Tanikawa Shuntaro. "To be alive, "To be alive now, "is to thirst, "is to be dazzled by the light, "is to remember a medley... "is to remember a melody, "is to sneeze, "is to hold your hand. "To be alive, "To be alive now" "is a miniskirt," "is a planetarium," "is Johann Strauss," "is Picasso," IS... Are you OK? Are you anaemic? Bet you didn't eat breakfast. I'm sorry. Niihara, take him to the nurse's office. Can you stand? Teacher, Ota isn't feeling well either. You know our teacher's figured it out. What plans do you three have today? No, it's not like that... When I was in grade school, I cut class to go to a rock concert. The trick I used was to rub it... under my armpit. You guys. What are the three of you up to? They seem to have fevers. Fevers? No, this is all you need to do for a fever. I think it's just the common cold. But what if the other students catch it? I was just going to call their families. You all right, Koichi? It's just that... He's been a little feverish since yesterday. This morning, too. His mother and I discussed if he should come. He showed up early. Yeah. Thanks for looking after my grandson. Because his parents are separated, please be a father to him... I wish we could have pulled this off all on our own... Oh, well... Thank you. Thank you. If teacher Sachi won't marry me, I'll marry the nurse. Me, too. No you can't, I said it first. Embrace. Bump. Waves. Care for sponge cake? No, thanks. Your grandpa stayed up last night, making more. Regular ones. They're regular ones. Off you go! Hey, hey, I can't find aroma oils. Will regular Buddhist incense work? Don't use that, Mum. It's not aromatic. Makoto! You're late. What's wrong? Marble died. You're taking it along? Yeah, can't I? Well... It's not that you can't... I'll give up professional baseball to bring Marble back to life. That's my miracle. Well, in that case... Off we go. I'm here! Cute hat. Oh, great. Rento! Here we go. Hey, wait. Let's go. Which platform? Platform 5, this way. A box lunch? Box lunch? Which is better? It's faster to buy and eat. We have an early morning tomorrow. Is a box lunch, OK? But a hamburger would be... A hamburger? But hamburgers are expensive... That's no fun. I can't follow. That hurt! Again! Really hurts. The tracks are all elevated. We won't be able to see the Bullet Train. The track's so high. That's Mt. Fugen. It was about 20 years ago. There was a bad eruption. The molten lava killed about 50 people. I don't want to live through that ever again. Hey brother! Long time! Long time! I brought my friends. You're not alone. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Could you see them? See what? The Bullet Train tracks. Weren't you watching? You didn't say you were bringing friends. I figured the more the merrier, right? Like a school trip? If they get in the way, I'll leave them. What's wrong with him? Thank you. Horsemeat sashimi. Let's go! Somebody's going to fall in. Splash... But it doesn't look that deep or that shallow. A fish jumped. Once in a while if you're watching, one jumps. But it's hard to see from here. Look, it jumped. That was super noisy. Really noisy. Look, we're surrounded by fields. I wonder who farms them. So much dirtier than before. Trivia! In dirty rivers there are lots of crayfish and loaches. 3 years for peaches, 8 for persimmon. 8 years is long. Super long. But that persimmon was born, after 8 long years. That's why it's so tasty now. This is a beautiful tree. Let's look for cosmos seeds. Amazing. So many seeds. The petals are so pretty. Look, a bee. I wonder where the people who used to live here went. They must have loved cosmos. Makoto, Tasuku, let's go. The rest of you. Ryu! Let's go! If you don't follow, I'll leave you behind. Show me the seeds. They're black. We have to find a spot today or we'll miss it tomorrow. Where are we spending the night? We have to find a spot to watch the trains first. I guess you're right. Let's try getting up on the roof of that supermarket. Good idea, let's go! Follow me! What? Run? I'm too tired. Hey, kid. Where are you going? - Jogging - Jogging? I'm tired. We're almost there. Can you see it? I can't see it. Can you see it? I'm so tired. I can't see it. Where else? Where's Rento? He's missing. Rento! Maybe he's below. Why'd you bring him along? What can I say? Ask the police? He's your friend. You're the leader. It's getting dark. Rento! Are they your friends? I don't get it. Why'd you go to a cop? Sorry, so that you wouldn't get caught by a cop. Things aren't good. Do you know the address? I lost the note with the address. I think that's it. Yes, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, so you're Higashi's granddaughter? Yes, I am. Why didn't you say? So, you're Noriko's daughter? Yes, Noriko is my mother. Granny! Your granddaughter was lost, so I brought her. Hi Grandma, good evening. I'm sorry we're so late. Yoshidaya's portions are small, so choose Kicho-an. Noodles will go limp, so order rice dishes. I know that! That's just was I was doing. Excuse me. Do they have horsemeat sashimi? Horsemeat? They don't deliver horsemeat sashimi. Oh, I see. There's no horsemeat sashimi. What? Oh, no. There isn't? The Bullet Train... Yes. Can you think of a spot? That supermarket? Uto City? Can you see it from their roof? We tried but you can't. It's not quite high enough. Are there any tunnels? There's a tunnel at Matsubase. Yes. If there's a tunnel, we may be able to look down and see it. They may not pass each other there, but we can see them. In that case, you should go to bed early. We'll drive you there tomorrow. Thank you! All 4 of us living together. Teacher Sack‚Äú... Marble will... Your legs? Not Bay Blades? Well... To paint well. Become an actress. No wish? Did I write too big? Just your name? It's connected. Your idea about a tunnel was a good one. I hope we can see it tomorrow. Noriko is... Our only daughter. What is she doing now? I wonder what she's up to. She left us. She didn't want to stay here. I see. Nice waves in your head. I have curly hair. I see. Does your mother usually brush it? No, I do... I see... Let's sleep. Tomorrow's early. They're doing something crazy. One of them's... Let's dance to YMCA. They take me back in time. She sure resembles her. That Megumi. When she smiles. When she first said good evening, I was so surprised. I thought I was dreaming. The number you have dialled... Mother? Are Koichi and Ryu meeting somewhere? He's fine. Don't worry. He'll be home tomorrow. Leave him be. Eat this. No, you eat it. It's OK. Really? We used to fight over those crumbs. Yeah. Oh, I forgot. Here. It's still an Indies label. Kanna drew this picture. Is that Dad in the middle? Yeah, even though it doesn't look the least bit like him. Hey, what does "Indies" mean? I think it means you've gotta work harder. Oh, I forgot. Grandpa made these. Thanks. What do you think? The flavour's kind of faint. I thought so, too, at first. But this mellow flavour is growing on me. You're so grown up. I'm in Junior High next year. Did you grow taller? Yeah. Mum was crying on the phone the other day. She's fine. She was just a little drunk. OK, then. You look after Dad, OK? I'm a little worried about Megumi's mum. I'll make sure they never meet. It's in your hands. Time to go to bed. Yeah. Thanks for helping us out, yesterday. I felt kind of desperate, but it was kind of fun. You were like an actress... She is an actress. Yeah. What do you think? My friends are cool, right? Thank you so much! Let's go. If you have a wish, I can make it for you. Yesterday... was all we could ask for. What were you saying? They're so nice, I warned them to be careful about bank frauds. They are so nice. I hope they're OK. Here we go! Let's hurry up. The tracks! You're right. It's here! It's here! Is it here? It's coming! It's here! From this way, too. I wish Dad's... All works out. Let me draw better! I want to be an actress! I want to run faster! Bring Marble back to life! Make Dad quit gambling! We did it, brother! Yeah. The train was so fast. I can't believe it. Truly amazing. How is it? No good. Colder than yesterday. Oh... But my legs hurt. Yeah, mine too. Want to bury him here? I'll take him home and bury him in the backyard. Say cheese. I hope our wishes come true. You know, I didn't make a wish. Why not? I chose the world over my family. Sorry. Actually... I made a different wish, too. Sorry. It's OK. Dad's all yours, now. That's what you said yesterday. Guess I did. Ryu! Let's take a picture. I forgot to teach you the butterfly. You can teach me next time! Leave it to me! Write me! I'll email! I'll call you soon. OK, see you. Take care now. Horsemeat Sashimi Crackers Are those the tracks? I'm home. Mum... I've decided I'm going to Tokyo. I'm going to Tokyo to be an actress. But I'll come home sometimes. Just sometimes. What study group were you in? I'm home. Welcome home. What are you guys doing so early? Actually, we just got a call from the TV station and we're going to be on Chart Busters. Amazing, right? That, you owe to me. Be grateful. Gee, thanks. Thanks. By the way Dad, what's the world? The Pachinko Parlour by the train station. That's The New World. We're home. We're home. We're home. - I'm home. - Welcome back. Does she know? You're fine. I fed Ryu your sponge cake. What'd he say? He's too young, still. Oh, I see. I'm home. Welcome back. - I'm home. - Welcome home. - We studied a lot. - That's great. You should get together again, then. Sure, thanks. It won't pile up today. Please make sure that I 'II always Be able to cry or laugh like now Please make sure that the cloudy sky Will all become clear Please, God, until the day you let me share just a little bit Of this picture-perfect happiness Until that day Hold back my tears Words keep tumbling out Going beyond mere thoughts I can't find the right words I get my wires crossed and land myself in trouble You always Turn around and smile At my sighing, mixed-up self Please forgive me This boring everyday life Passes as a matter of course A flower has bloomed in a hidden crack Let's meet again next year Come over here Even though there's nothing here We can go anywhere we want And it will only hurt a little WRITTEN, DIRECTED & EDITED BY HIROKAZU KORE-EDA
