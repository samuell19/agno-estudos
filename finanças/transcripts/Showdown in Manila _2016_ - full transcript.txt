Subtitles by explosiveskull Are you sure about this, Kiki? When have I ever been wrong? Name one time. I don't lie to you, Nick. And, without a doubt, this is Rousseau? Yeah, that's him. He's there a lot. Take one more look. Definitely him. Yeah, Sarge. Word has it... that Diaz works for Wraith. I've heard the rumor. We've got something. It's Diaz. Remember. We get Diaz, and we get out. What about the girls? We'll try to set them free. Here, Kiki. Thanks, Nick. Watch yourself. Excuse me, boys. Go. This man just came in. I-I don't remember. He came in with three other men and five girls. I must have missed him? You saw him. Where did he go? Uh, four... four... fourth floor. East w... East wing. Go. Go. Cesar. Cesar. Cesar, come in. Cesar. HQ, this is VCU-1. We have 1045-B. Come in. There's no signal. Someone's using a jammer, sarge. It's a setup. They knew we were coming. What's up, little bitches?! You looking for me? I'm right here. Flash bang! Ugh! Aah! Aah! Reyes, on me! - You hurt? - No. You? No. I'm out. Aaah! Sarge. Sarge. I'm hit. I'm hit. Sarge. Sarge. - I'm bleeding out. - No. You'll be all right. Hang in, Reyes. Backup is coming. Come on. You've got this. Move! Let's go! Nick? Nick. Honey. Hey. Doctors say you were lucky. Your head was just grazed. The shoulder hits were worse. You need to rehab that, but it will be fine. You will be fine. Hi, Sofia. Hello. Hi. I shouldn't be alive. - Don't say that, Nick. - She's right. You got to focus on the real bad guys... the ones responsible for all this. This wasn't your fault. Lieutenant Kalalo, I need a word. Captain Minter. I just came from the crime scene. Do you realize what kind of PR nightmare we have on our hands? What the hell happened? It's a bloodbath out there. Almost an entire strike team was wiped out! With all due respect, Captain, this is the Violent Crime Unit. We deal with the worst of the worst. Funny how he made it out. Sergeant Peyton is an excellent team leader. Was a team leader. He's through. He led them right into an ambush. His recklessness caused all this. With all due respect, sir, I think you're looking for a scapegoat. Watch yourself, Lieutenant. Somebody didn't do their job right. I'm saying it was him. Keep up this attitude, it could be you, too. What? Excuse me, sir? Is that a threat? Are you threatening me?! - Stand down, Lieutenant! - Are you threatening me?! Lieutenant, stand down! Captain. Captain, it's on me. Just me. You know, we should probably get out of these chairs at some point. Why would we do that? Mm. I don't know. Get some exercise or something. We came here to relax. Besides... it's a long walk to the water. I like your thinking. You want another one? Yes, please. Another one what? Stop. Dorn! Go get help! Noooo! No! What?! Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay. I... I... I... I love you. I love you. I love you. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Matt! Matt! No! No! Matt! Aaah! Aaah! Hi. I am Lieutenant F.A. Kalalo. I'm deeply sorry for your loss. Look. I've been here for hours. I've told everyone that interviewed me exactly what I saw. I've read your statement. That must have been a horrific experience for you. We've confirmed that your husband was employed by the FBI back in the States and that you were vacationing here, as you told us. So you believe my account of what happened. Do you know if your husband was involved with the perpetrators in any way? What do you mean? Not counting your husband, we have three dead... all innocent people. We have a lot of gangs here, and when they go to war, they... This wasn't a gang war. I gave an exact description of the people that I saw that were involved! I appreciate that. It's just that there are dozens of conflicting descriptions about the perpetrators and what they look like. I believe this man was in charge. Impressive work. I'm a police sketch artist. Do you recognize him? I'm not sure. Can you wait here, please? This is Detective Jovalyn Sabio from the Violent Crime Unit. Hello, Mrs. Wells. I'm so sorry for your loss. She will take you to a safe place. Can we at least stop by my hotel first? Sorry. It's too dangerous. What? Sorry. I thought we had a tail. It's safe now. It's all right. We're okay. It's okay. You know those guys? No. But they know you. That's why you can't go back to your hotel. You did good. Okay, show me. What's wrong? Uh, must be the batteries. Oh, there it goes. That's my wife. Keep watching, Mr. Camato. Who's that creep with Vivian? His name is David Beckles. He's a car salesman. - But it doesn't matter. - What do you mean? Keep watching, Mr. Camato. She has two lovers? Slut! Keep watching, Mr. Camato. Three lovers? Clients. She's a pro, Mr. Camato. A prostitute? Call girl. A high-class call girl. That's why she kisses on the lips. Not that I know. Never should have married such a young woman. Oh, uh, you know, you... you don't want to watch any more. You don't... You don't want to see this. It's gonna break your heart. Not again. Uh, oh, wow. Ooh. Ohh. Uh, sorry. Surveillance photos. I'm really sorry you had to find out about your wife this way, Mr. Camato. It's what I paid you to do. Domo arigato, Mr. Camato. What was that, Charlie? I forgot the camera was rolling. Did you forget you don't sleep with our clients, too? Technically, she's not a client. Hey, I don't have a hot girlfriend. Want to see it again? - Hey, Jovalyn. How's it going? - It's going good, Nick. I'd like for you to meet Cheryl Wells. Charlie Benz, private investigator. What are we doing here? Lieutenant Kalalo believes that they can help you. And who are they? Nick Peyton was a sergeant on the Violent Crime Unit Strike Force, and Charlie Benz was a Los Angeles police officer. All right, Mr. Peyton, why aren't you with the Strike Force anymore? A bust went bad, we were set up, and I took the hit for it. And, Mr. Benz, why aren't you with LAPD? It's... complicated. He slept with his commander's wife. I used to have a problem. - He's sex addict. - I go to meetings now. - Wha...? - Look, Mrs. Wells. These men are actually really good at what they do. Trust me. They can help you. Help with what? As an FBI agent, my husband worked with Interpol more than once. I'm guessing that he recognized this man from one of his previous cases. He's called the Wraith. Police artists drew this sketch for me two years ago. I've dealt with the bastard before. You think you can find him? If he's back in this area, yes. But you'll have to be fast because he moves his base of operations around all the time. Excuse me. The Wraith? The cold-blooded human and drug trafficker that no one ever sees? And if they do, they end up dead? Which is why they call him the Wraith in the first place? That's who we're going after? Yes. But Jovalyn just said he works globally. He's probably not even in the Philippines right now. You lost an entire team and almost got killed, and now it's rumored that he has his own private army. Great. Why the hell can't the police handle this? Because Lieutenant Kalalo believes that some of the force is actually on the Wraith's payroll. That's why Nick got set up when he went after Carlos Diaz. Look, Mrs. Wells, I feel for you. I really do. But we work fraud, cheating partners, and some dating-scam cases. I'll give you 50,000 U.S. dollars if you find him. We can look for him. Another $50,000 if you bring him to me. I mean, he can't hide forever. Does anyone know what his real name is? - No. - Wonderful. I can work with this. We should take you somewhere safe. I'll take her to my place. The lieutenant says that this is off the books. Call him on his mobile phone only after you find the Wraith. And, Nick, don't forget that you still have friends. Where do you want to begin? If we check every source we have, somebody has to know something. The trouble will be getting them to talk. - Oh, we'll make them talk. - We'll make them talk? Mm-hmm. You gonna go all Godzilla on me? Godzilla? Every time you take a case personal, someone gets their head pounded in. - Not all the time. - Most of the time. Some of the time. Pretty much every time. So, what? When you were a cop, you didn't get passionate about your cases? - When I was a cop? - Yeah. Work was work. I did my job. I didn't take things personal. That's what we're gonna do on this job. We're private investigators, not terminators. If you want out... I don't want out. We're partners. And you want your cut of the money. That, too. My friend. We're looking for this guy. No. I haven't seen him. You're sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Okay. We are getting nowhere fast. - Nobody's saying a thing. - Or they're holding out. Probably scared of the Russian Hulk. We should have done this my way. Mm, then we would have ended up in jail. Look, Nick, I know how much this thing means to you. No, you don't. I got my whole team killed by this son of a bitch. I owe him! We'll get him, partner. Something will turn up. Sorry. We're cool. Hey, Nick! Charlie! Hey. How are your folks? Good. Business is great. Lots of deliveries. Listen. You ride all over the city. Have you seen him? Mnh-mnh. Who's he? - Someone very bad. - We really need to find him. I can keep my eyes open. Why don't you ask Kiki for help? She's good at this stuff. - She's away. In rehab. - No, she's not. I saw her at Club Dread last night. And I saw her with that Datu guy outside the Tiki Lounge. That's the first place we checked. Told you. We should have done this my way. Do you always have to have the last word? Absolutely. What will you have? Information. I don't know about that guy. Where can I find Datu? Who's that? Whoa! Ohh! Aah! No more lying! I don't know anything Datu! Aaaah! Waah! Ohh! Where is Datu? I don't know. I don't know. I don't speak Wookiee, Chewbacca. - Talk. - Really, really, really. I don't know. Aah! Upstairs. Up those stairs. Upstairs. Thank you. It's Nikolai Peyton. No, shit. Let him in. - Hold it, 5-0. - Relax. Well, well, well, look at you. What are you here for? You're no longer a cop. That's true. But I miss you so much, Datu, I thought I'd stop by. What do you want, Peyton? First, where is Kiki? She's smoking pole somewhere. Hmm. I see. You're still pissed you can't have Kiki, right? I don't know what you're talking about, Peyton. But I've been banging Kiki like a firecracker. You know, Belle, you should probably leave. Your boyfriend over here is going down. Now. I'm sorry. It's time someone shuts your mouth for you. Aah! Kill him! Datu! Oh! Aah! - Aah! - Oh! As I said, two questions. First... where's Kiki? Trying to see... a guy! Second question. Who is he? I don't know. I don't know him. Again. I told you I-I don't know him! I swear! Aah! Leave Kiki alone. I thought you were in rehab. It sucked. I had to leave. And you moved out of your place? My landlord wants favors again. Who's this? The Wraith. Seriously? Yeah. I've never seen his face before. But I heard a lot about him, though. This man... He causes pain. Me and Charlie are working for a woman now. He killed her husband in cold blood right in front of her. Hello! Hi. Hi, I'm Sofia, and you must be... It's Kiki, our informant. Hmm. Cool. So this is the girlfriend. I guess so. You want some Chinese? Yes, Chinese is very good. We met in New York. I was a cop, and she was a journalist. I still am. Back then, when I got transferred to the Philippines, Nick said he wouldn't let me fly alone. I followed her to Manila, finally got a job at VCU. The rest is history. What can I say? That's a really nice love story. Thank you. Anyway, I just stopped by to remind you of our date on Friday. Theater. Don't you forget. Okay? I will not. Thank you. Bye, Kiki. Say hi to Charlie for me, all right? I will. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Brought your Chinese food. Sofia stopped by. She said hello. There is one thing, though. I don't know if it's gonna mean much, but I worked at Reese's bar yesterday. Great go-gos there. Or so I've heard. Anyway, there was this guy... this big guy, and he had long blond hair. Long blond hair? Yeah, and, um, his name was Dorn. He likes the girls at Reese's bar. He's from out of town, so he doesn't come around often, but yesterday, I saw him there. The last time I saw him was two years ago, when you were trying to take down Carlos Diaz. What time have you seen him yesterday? Around happy hour. Great time to go. Appetizers are half off. Okay. You can stay here tonight. You can have a couch over there. And, Kiki, take it. Take it. But tomorrow you start to earn it. You can clean up around here. You can answer the phone. And there's a secretary desk. We should start to use it. We have a secretary's desk? There's a secretary's desk. Looks like you got my whole day planned out for me. Get used to it. Bossy. Bo-ssy. Hi. So, how are the meetings going? Huh? The sex addict anonymous meetings. Oh. Good. Okay, I guess. It's... You know, addiction control is difficult with so many enablers out there. Enablers? Cute Filipino girls. And they're beyond cute. And given what I'm up against, I'd say that my self-discipline is pretty impressive. You're my hero, Charlie. Yeah, I know. Hey, it's him. We can't jack him up too much. We need him to talk. Don't worry. - Hi, Charlie. - Hey, Anton. This is Peyton. She's there. Hey, Charlie. Hey. Nice to see you again, Charlie. You too. More enablers, huh? You no call me! I was gonna call you. We've been working a big case. You want bang-bang? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my colleague. Peyton, Miss Divina. Miss Divina, Peyton. Peyton. Miss Divina. Okay. We're looking for someone. He's big, almost like him. Blond hair. Dorn. Yeah. I don't want no trouble here, Charlie. When have I ever given you any trouble? Okay, that was just that one time, but, please. Please? Thanks. How do you want to do this? That'll do it. Don't move. Ladies. Out. Now. Who the hell are you? You don't remember? You tried to kill me. If that were true, you'd be dead. But I'm not. Hmm. Palace Hotel, rooftop, two years ago. Looks like you got lucky. Hey, you're coming with us now. Why? We need to talk. What are you? Cops? No. Got booted out, huh? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm leaving now, and if you're smart... and that's a big "if"... you'll forget that we ever met. I know what you want to talk about. It's not gonna happen. You'll either shoot me or get the fuck out of my way. Nick. Or we're gonna go mano a mano, and you can try to make me talk. But I don't think your balls are big enough. Nick, what are you doing? Would you go away, Charlie? Charlie?! What's going on? You still owe me money! You only paid me 20! Charlie! You told me no trouble! What is... What is going on here? Move. Who was that? One more. Hey, mister, looking for someone? Two really big guys. Are you police? Private investigator. Whoa, so you're chasing bad guys? Yeah, really bad guys. You see which way they went? Um, they went through that gate. Okay. But I can show you the better way. Take it. Oh. Whoa. Sorry. Move! - I'm Larissa. - I'm Charlie. I'm an exchange student, you know. - That's great. - I run track in school. I don't doubt that. - Is this a big case? - Pretty big. I'm thinking of being an Olympic athlete. I believe you! Look! It's him! Thanks! Come on! I had this guy. You totally you had him, buddy. Wow! You guys put some pain on him. Although you might want to bulk up a bit. Get a little more mass. I should get a pic of this. Um, no, no. No photos. See, we're undercover. Oh, cool. Thank you. But you should go. And good luck at the Olympics. Thank you. I'm gonna be watching for you. Olympics? What? So you like go-go girls, right? Hey, hey, hey! You're about to lose your balls, man. We're gonna ask you some questions, and you will answer them. Believe it. I've seen him do it. Holy crap! Is he dead? Nope. Just out. He was giving us trouble when we were tying him up. Well, can you blame him? Okay, so now that I've seen that, does that make me an accomplice? - Pretty much. - To what? Kidnapping, discharging a firearm in public. Property damage. Lots of it. Yeah, that, too, and the other stuff. I thought you guys only did, like, cheating spouses, dating fraud, stuff like that. So did I. This is like when you were a cop? Actually, worse. You know, Kiki, it's important that Dorn will stay in the trunk right now. If anyone stop by looking for him or for us, be polite, be professional... And lie. You never heard of Dorn. Tell them we're on an infidelity case. What if the cops come by? Lie again. Tell them nothing. They could work for Aldric Cole. Who's that? The Wraith. Or at least that's what Dorn said. So I'm working for you now? Yeah, that's the plan, if you want. Okay. But I want a raise. I didn't offer you a salary yet. Yeah, but when you do, it's gonna be too low. You hired her. We got to go. Yeah. Raise? Raise. Just give me a minute. She's a good woman. I know you. Something big is happening. Please tell me what's going on. I told you it's nothing. I care about you. Don't shut me out. Okay, I have to do something. Part business, part personal. How dangerous is it? Don't you dare miss the theater night on Friday. I won't. I promise. Don't worry. Bye. Think Dorn leveled with us? I think he wanted to keep his balls. I just hope I can read his handwriting. Nick. Lieutenant. I think I found the Wraith. I need some help. Where are you? I'll give you my location. But listen, I need my friends. Peyton, don't tell me you're still a lowlife gumshoe. You surprise me, Ford. I thought you'd be a dispatcher by now, barking orders to meter maids. Well, you know the three stooges, right? Yeah. I've seen a few of their films. I see you're still getting your butt kicked. And I see you're still nagging me when I do, Haines. Good to see you. Good to see you, too. It's been a while, Peyton. Too long, my friend. Guys, this is Charlie. He's my friend. You can count on him. Charlie, Haines, Ford, Dillon, and Victor. Great to meet you all. Another Russian, huh? Yeah, there is more than one in the world. I was talking about speaking Russian. It's called bilingual. You know what it's called when you speak only one language? What? American. They're just busting your balls, pal. We do it all the time. You see, we all used to work together with Nick. Understood. I work with him now. All right, let's get this out of the way. We all know you got set up by the brassholes in P.I., Nick. Everybody knew it was bullshit. Absolutely. Enough of this. Let's kick some ass. I see you came hot. Well, we sexed up the best we could. I brought a few things that go boom. Not bad. I can slice the balls off a mosquito with this. That wasn't creepy. You got to see this. Dorn told the truth. They're getting ready to move. Figures. He's always on the move. Can we get eyes on him? Check out the 10:00. It's Aldric Cole. That son of a bitch. You know what, Charlie, screw the money. Whoa! You do that, and they'll know exactly where we're at. We can still get him. I can take out their ops. At least they won't be able to tell the others where we're coming from. What about the .50? Who is the quickest runner? - Me. - Me. Think you can take one of the .50s? I can make it to the first one, but I'm gonna need a lot of cover. Would a diversion help? Yeah. A lot. You see their ground snipers? That would be the biggest problem. Yet again, I don't know how many are there. You could end up stepping on them. Call the lieutenant. Get the rest of the force as backup. Yeah. And the moment we do that, there's a good chance he'll get tipped off. They'll be gone. If we want to kill him, we're gonna have to do this on our own. But it's up to you. Let's do it. I can make it down that ridge. Take out the right. That'll be your diversion. Good enough. Victor, where can you get the best shot? Right there. Charlie, follow me. We'll take this side. And try to get to the tent to grab Cole. Hey, Victor, give us 10 before we get to the position, and after that, take out the OPs. And, Haines, as soon as you get to one of the .50s, take it. - We'll need the firepower. - You got it. One question. If we get this Cole asshole, what do we do with him? Take him alive. Me and Charlie supposed to bring him to Mrs. Wells. For what? We didn't ask. I cannot find Dorn. Go! Get down! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Go, go, go! - Let's go! - Back me up! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ah, Batman and Robin come to save the day. Yeah, well, I wish I could offer you a cigar, but... but it ain't my way. You're coming with us. I'd rather not. You broke my lab. You killed all my men. It wouldn't be hard to believe that I fought back and got away. Not this time. You know I got international friends in low places. They wouldn't be happy if I was arrested. We're not here to arrest you. As I said, you're coming with us. Good job. Hey, Cole. Take a good look. Come on. Take it. You okay? Cold. Cold? It's so cold in Russia. I used to have an ice-fishing shack in my bathtub with my bear. Ohh. All right, hit it. Go. I'll be right back. Okay. Dasvidaniya. Next time you want to take down some bad guys, count me in. I promise, Dillon. Thanks for everything. Next time you need your hand held, make sure you give me a call. On my speed dial. I'll be right back. Hey. Hey. You did good out there. Thanks. I was wondering, uh, would you like to go out with me sometime? I'll go out with you. But if you cheat on me, I'll kill you. Call me. If you ever get tired of working VCU, you can be P.I. with us. Are you kidding me? That's too boring. The lieutenant has a doctor that will take care of Victor. No questions asked. Good. What are you gonna do with Cole? I don't know. It's up to Mrs. Wells. He doesn't go to jail. Let us know if you need a cleaner. I will. Thank you. All right. It would never have worked out between her and I. She's here. Thanks. Send them in. Hey, Kiki, you can go home now. I'll see you tomorrow. But... But... But I thought that... No. No. Just lock the front door on your way out. Do it. This is Aldric Cole, the Wraith, and Dorn, his Viking. This ain't a social club. Can we get on with this? Shut up. You murdered my husband Matthew. He didn't stand a chance, considering the odds against him. Matthew was a good man, a good husband. And an expert marksman. He taught me all about guns... how to shoot them. That's so touching. Are you done? No. Am I under arrest? No. Detective Sabio, I-I need a car to the airport. I'm transporting my husband's body back home. Okay, Mrs. Wells. Your money will be in your accounts before the end of the day tomorrow. Is that all right? Yeah. Mr. Peyton, Mr. Benz, thank you. Say to the lieutenant we need cleaners. Done. What are we gonna do now? We'll sit down and wait for cleaners. I took these off of Cole when I cuffed him. He won't be needing it where he's at. That's true. Not bad. We should go to Cuba. We should. Subtitles by explosiveskull
