Produced by nikkatsu inc. Sometimes... like a prostitute original song and screenplay: Rei nakanishi producer: Akira miura assistant director: Naosuke kurosawa music: Rei nakanishi Directed by Masaru konuma Shinagawa - Tokyo wow, the ocean! It's the ocean! It's so good to see it again. - Commercials set on Hawaii. - You're not funny. Ah, right. We forgot the swimsuits. That's because you rushed me. I wanted to take my time packing. What do you think about that one? I like this one better. No way I'm wearing this! Hey, wait. She's so pretty. No! No! Ryo-chan! Hey! - What? - Forget it. Too strong for me. It's because you bought me that sexy bikini. Let's go to a quiet place. Ryo-chan, won't you swim? It feels great! Look at her... So cute! I used to find them cute too. Why don't you give it a break? We didn't come here to work. I need to pay this month's installment on the car. Let's dance in the bar downstairs. Thank you. Mako. The stars are so beautiful. Yes. I love to fall asleep watching the stars. I'll move the bed to the window. Yeah, that's great. You're so smart. Alright. Ryo-chan, you're still a young man. See? Not only in bed. Obviously. Where are we? You don't remember? Don't you look at the road? I'm not really aware of my surroundings. I have an inner universe, so I don't pay much attention to the world. I love how logically you explain your contradictions. You need some kind of device to assist your driving. It would go "ding-ding‚Äù when you take a wrong turn. Like a compass. I would enjoy that. Hey, it rang. Silly, that's the signal that I sped past 100km/h. - Hey, I think I'm pregnant. - Eh? I was kidding, but what if it was true? Mako, we agreed we didn't want a baby. You're already a handful. I don't need a kid on top. I'd like to bear your child. What's wrong, ryo-chan. I don't... feel well. Your heart? Ryo-chan. I need my regular hospital. We can't, it's in Tokyo. Quick, let's go. Ryo-chan, please hold on. What can I say? His alcohol, his cigarettes... In his condition... Even you are a danger to his heart. Sorry to be so blunt to a young wife, but... He could die in your arms anytime. I'm sorry. He'll receive his treatment tomorrow morning. Bye. I love you... please don't die. Mako, take my bag. Take the present in it. What? Is it for me? What is that? A moai doll. A prize I got playing golf. Is that a moai? Hey, that's... Kinky. You can use it to replace me. What a silly idea. I'm trowing it out. Mako. Can't you use it while thinking about me? I won't! I don't have the energy. Do you love me? If you ask me like this... Just a little. Ryo-chan. What is that? No. That's scary. So? You like it? I like it. Stop it! Stop it! I'm not stopping. This way I'm sure you won't get pregnant. Keep going! Hello... eh? Happiness. Right. Alright. Doing three handstands every morning makes you happy. An advice from the happiness church. They say it fulfills your wishes. Would you like to try? Idiot. You have no wishes at all. What wishes? About your life. Obviously... My life is not as I wish. I mean what you wanted to be as a kid. Probably not to become a translator of erotic novels. But what if from birth... I was destined to become 3 translator of erotic novels? These emotions are too hard on your heart. Listen, mako. He penetrated her with his cigarette. Or: He shoved a cigarette into her. Which one is more kinky? You didn't answer. Yes. Hey, it's you. A job? Sure I can work. Right. Alright, then. See you. Mako. - Let's sleep. - It's too early. Let's do it. You're a little monster. Metamorphosis. Mako. The doctor said no smoking. Sex can be dangerous too. That too. We're overindulging. Excessive sex is not good. It's written on your chest. Mako, I'm dumping the other one. Like, right now? What a bold resolution. So, I'll see you later. I wish you luck. Don't drink. One handstand. Two handstands. Three... ouch! Ah, I'm out of breath. When I first came here, even drunk... I had no problem climbing those stairs. You lost your enthusiasm to hold me in your arms. Men's attraction to women is 100% sex-driven. And it decreases with time. A glass of whiskey. Beer... just a sip. You can't drink that much anymore. What pleasures have you left. I don't know either. In my case, I can't keep modeling forever. I'd like to get married. I envy mako. If you were married to me, you'd be in hell. Isn't this hell? You are right. You scared the hell out of me. Hello, Mr. matsumoto. Ryo-chan is here. I had a feeling you'd be here. You were not answering your phone. I came here hoping to see you. I was right. Hi. - Mako? - She didn't answer? No. Oops. She's cheating on you. For you. Another business card. Now you're production director. No way, a director? Ryo-chan, have you noticed? Kids are so mature nowadays. She was only 14! I was so surprised. First time I had a 14 year old. She was delightful. She was wearing her school uniform. Some even get married at that age. I'm so jealous. - Of what? - Idiot. He doesn't touch me lately. I could give you a hand? No, thanks! By the way. Guess who I met in a bar in akasaka. - Who? - That goro from shibuya. Hey, you remember me? How could I forget you? Sorry, I'm with an important guest. But we should drink some time. Don't look so depressed. Hey, how is your friend? - That guy... - Ryosuke is fine, thanks. That's right, ryosuke, ryosuke. I'm not sure I even like beer anymore. Meg, I'm going to bed. Matsumoto, you can stay if you wish. If you don't mind. Meg, matsumoto is sleeping here. Yes, I was going to offer. It's fine. Nothing feels right today. Ryo-chan, you prefer a bed or a futon? Stop, he can hear us. So what? He won't mind. I give up. Come on, ryo-chan. You know I need it. I have a headache. - My shoulders are stiff. - I'll massage you. Sex feels so good. It even heals me when I'm sick. Nothing feels right today. I'm going to sleep. Wake me up at three. How dare you take a girl from goro? You think you can show your face in shibuya now? Huh? How about that girl? How about mariko? Tell us? Where is she now? Tell us, idiot! Let's cut off his finger. You can't cut off my finger. You were hurting that girl. As long as you hurt mariko, I'll stand in your way! The customers like her. Where is she? Speak or we'll fuck up your face. Speak and we'll let you go. Midori residence. Did I tell them? Did I tell them? Mariko. Mariko. Fuck! Who is this? Ryo-chan? Hey, you're back early. Well, I dumped her. You look like she dumped you. Is that takeda? Yes, please greet him. Hi. - Good to see you. - How are you doing? - I found a job. - Where? Ground personnel for jal. I owe it to your recommendation. You're very skilled. They'll assign me to flights in Autumn. Great, you'll visit New York, Paris... Yes, indeed. Well. Sorry, I have to get up early tomorrow. I made sure to see your wife home. - Come by for a drink next time. - I will, thank you. Goodbye. - You enjoyed it? - What? - With takeda? - We just talked. - That late? - What else would we do? Takeda is doing well. Young people are full of ambition. But still... When you recommended him he wasn't too keen. Because he wanted to succeed so badly. Nothing felt right today. - I'm hungry. - What do you want to eat? I'll eat something that feels right. - COD roe spaghetti. - You have some? - 1 do. - I'll have that, then. This should feel right. Yes, that feels right. Did you feel right today? I always feel right. - Because I love you. - How boring. Boring maybe, but it feels right. - A cue from that sagan movie. - That felt right, too. Good morning. You finished? That was fast. I need the money. I just gave you money a week ago. Dirty money flows fast. But it's fun... how about this one? I found a good rewriter for this one. I'll introduce him. Sorry, I'm here only to get my money. There's another great novel for you. You shouldn't be that straightforward. I don't have time for roundabouts. I need 300.000 yen. We're very satisfied to work with you. You're fast and you're talented. Ah right, the book we just received. As usual, it's a rush job. A famous author published in the states. Stretch your legs 7 little more... that's it. Lower your chin... right. Close your mouth... ok. Your side now... no. Change the position. Left foot, same foot. Keep showing it. Your hand higher on your waist. Please keep your panties hidden. Collar open, hand on the chest. Like before. Look at me. Both hands on the waist. Keep looking at the camera. Let's go now. Close your mouth. Let's go. Maybe I showed too much skin. You're very young. You'll gain experience as you work. - I need to relax. - Relaxation is good. Put your feet up. Lower them slowly. Keep lowering and raising them. Yes, more, yes. Don't be awkward. Right. Once more, raise them. She's late. A canary that forgot how to sing A canary that forgot how to sing A canary that forgot how to sing Sorry, I'm a little drunk. With takeda? No. I was working today. We all went for a drink. Work? You were modeling? Idiot, give me a break. We don't need that! We have money! What's wrong, ryo-chan? Why are you upset? Because I'm working? Because I'm late? Both. You don't need to work. Do you want to support me so I can write my novel? Orisit... That you are preparing to leave me? You have strange ideas tonight. I can't stay idle all day. You're young and restless, is that it? Out there you'll find a better husband. You're mean. All day I'm yearning to hear you moaning. I'm fine, I don't need to have sex. Liar! It's hard enough to stay together when we do it... If we don't, we're total strangers. Stop this! Ryosuke, what's wrong? Your heart condition holds you back... And you take it out on me. You think too much and you're irritated. Just look... I'm my usual self. I'm your wife. And that's why... I put weird objects inside of me and moan to please you. In those moments... Can't you see I feel humiliated? You stay with me to hear me moan? Alright then, I'll moan for you. Enough. I get it. I'm sorry. Ryo-chan. Are you ok? Matsumoto, you like my boat? It's great, I love it. We love it too. We thought it would be good for the image of the gang. Juro especially insisted to buy it. We finally bought it. Look how good he looks. Right captain? Right. But you see... We enjoy the boat and much more. We're going to assault you. Because, you see, matsumoto... We have so many clubs and bars. We make the most of them. Am I right, juro? If you could introduce me to that singer... There are so many celebrities. That one who sings paradise, paradise. - You mean Leila? - Right, Leila, Leila. Look at this one, she's had a few. What do you say, captain? We're all good to go to Africa. Right. Well, we'll be in hatsushima at sunset. I see. Ryo-chan, are you alright? Open the window. I need air. Ryo-chan, I'm sorry. Are you ok? Please, don't die. Mrs. saito. Your husband has been released. Released? How did he manage? It seems he had an urgent matter. Wait! Tell him to return the umbrella. Central hospital a canary that forgot how to sing A canary that forgot how to sing A canary... What? What are you doing, ryo-chan? Mako, hand me the towel. Can't she take care of herself? She's a crazy girl. Ryo-chan, what's going on? Where did you find that girl? I think mariko suits her well. Please call her by that name. Can you explain this situation? Ryo-chan, please, stop acting so strangely. After that incident... You think you can bring back mariko? Things were supposed to be over with mariko. You moved on and married me. A canary... Mariko, could you pee for me? Ryo-chan! I took a lot from you. Like when you refused me a child... But this I can't take! Please, could you forget the past? Mako, I need you to be quiet. She can hear you. You're hurting her. But I... I thought her mind was gone. A canary that forgot how to sing We have decided to get married. Married? Congratulations. Aren't we a perfect match? We'll be a perfect couple. He's a bit strange. He says sex is only enjoyable if he has it with me. Husband and wife! This is great! You'll have to straighten up your life. If I don't, I'll die. Maybe it's already too late. Mako, you're drinking too much. Behave yourself. Mako, you're not yourself tonight. Are you ok, mako? Mako. What do you want? Go away. Ryosuke... Ryosuke... In the mountain behind? A canary that forgot how to sing Yes. Huh? You'll wait here quietly. He's here. Mako, let's go. Hey, it's ryosuke. So glad to see you. How are you? You don't look good. You're going? Take care of your woman. You don't want anything to happen to her. Hey, wait! You remember mariko? She went crazy and killed herself. But you know who those crazies are... They're totally wild in bed, absolutely amazing. Hey, let's go. - I need to pee. - Sure, sure. I'm so lonely. What's this? It's not raining. Ryo-chan, are you crying? Obstetrics and gynaecology clinic Welcome. Is it for a boy? Ryo-chan, can you come? Ah, here you are. Look, mariko is laughing. Look, it's the first time she's laughed. Ryo-chan, we need to talk. I'm sure it can wait. Come, play with us. No. What is this? There, for you. A thick envelope this time. Thank you. You are a precious asset for our company. Really? Shouldn't you rejoice too? I bet a young couple like you guys plan on having a kid. For a man, a kid is the ultimate achievement. - Well, do it then. - I can't have kids. I sold my soul to business. I sold mine long ago. May I buy your soul too? Huh? - This is for you. - I can't accept that. - You're so kind. - I wanted to see you smile. Mariko. Mariko. Mako. Train departing for towada on platform 5 at 12:15... - Please take her inside. - Alright, come. I'm back. Why is it so dark in here? You went to aomori? Sorry, I didn't tell you. I visited my parents' grave and met my brother. These are your favorite green apples. - They're early this year. - Where's mariko? Can we forget about mariko now? She's in the hospital in aomori? Listen, ryo-chan. I did it for your own sake. Please don't go! I was wrong. I'll do anything you ask. Let's get a divorce. Ryo-chan! I am preg... Ryo-chan, wait! Don't go! Ryo-chan! Please stop! Hello. It's mako. Madam! Aomori station departing for towada national park... Aomori green apples - You saw the fair? - I didn't. Hey, that's the fair. Hey, it's so beautiful. It's great. It's so big. To towada Shiomidai hospital bus stop Mariko. Mariko! There. Say, mister, are you from Tokyo? Come on, are you depressed? You look like you've seen a ghost. Tokyo takes a toll on you people. You see, I have a daughter. Two years ago, she went to Tokyo. She's not even writing to me. What is she doing there? Are you married? Yeah. But it could be she doesn't love me. I hope my daughter doesn't say that. Maybe my mom doesn't love me. Such a sad life. It's the fair festival. Get out and have fun! Beautiful. You can go now. Dance your heart out. Alright? Come on. Shake that Tokyo dust from your soul. Hurry up! Go! Hey, who is this? Let's go see. Yay. He's alive! Let's tickle him! Don't tickle me. I'm glad you called. It's so different from what I remember. This large road is abandoned now. Mako, I hope we can get back together. A coat of paint on a boat... Brings good luck, it draws fish. Fish don't like to be caught. They go far away. Mako, let's have a child. I'm ready to be a father now. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm just so happy! Mako. Look, there is a boat at sea. It comes from distant lands. That's why I love boats. Don't you love me? Never before... Have I loved you more. This is for ryosuke. To celebrate your new life... I'm inviting you to a masked party. September 10th at midnight. In the salon in akasaka. Be sure to dress up. Mako. Akiko, you can't wear my clothes. I didn't ask you to come. Does my beauty fascinate you? Beauty? Give me a break. - You with your fake tits! - Looks who's talking! Just looking at yourself in the mirror should kill you. Sure, I'll die right here with you! Let me help you with that! Just die! Meg. Oh, look, he's a man! What? You ugly dog! You crazy tranny! I'm not a tranny, I'm just gay! Stop, you're hurting me. Matsumoto. Where's mako? Ryo-chan, let's have a drink. Mako. Mako. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, you! Ryo-chan. Why is she doing that? Sometimes, like a prostitute... You lead a dissolute life you wear your crimson lipstick... And your high-heels you spread your legs... And you wink at me you call me with your finger I see you're inviting me better than a boring life... At least we're having fun Sometimes, like a prostitute... You sweat abundantly... To show me your love you torture me for my own sake Goodbye. Sometimes, like a prostitute... You behave in a vulgar manner you yell with your beautiful voice you scream your lungs out you pinch your nipples... To sprinkle me with your milk and just like a suckling... I avidly drink from you better than a boring life... At least we are... Having fun together sometimes, like a prostitute... You exhaust me in bed and this man that you love... Needs to take a deserved rest The end
