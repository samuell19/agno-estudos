It wasn't him. Of course it wasn't him. And yet... I couldn't help hoping, just for a moment, when I heard the song... I didn't think the song could bring him back so suddenly, so near, as if it were yesterday. Living here so long, I'd thought I was past hoping, past remembering. I'd thought it was all long ago and far away. Eyomar doesn't know. He's too innocent, too simple. All he knows is this place, where he was born, where he has always lived, on the edge of the desert. We never speak of the past. The past was buried with Rose Graham, five years ago. The past is only a dream that brought me here, and left me for lost. Now, with that music, the dream comes back, and I remember. My first time out of England... how could I have known I'd never go back? My life had been so ordinary, so quiet. I'd been a governess, and I was happy with children. And I sat in the train, thinking of the children who'd grown up, and wondering about my new post: companion to Mrs. Prouse. Selena Prouse, an English lady living in Morocco. It was Ahmed who came to my rescue that first evening, in the middle of the square. Ahmed the guide. He sat down so calmly beside me, and said he knew who I was, and where I wanted to go. He spoke very little, but he had a kind of power, and from the first, I found I obeyed him. Oh, Ahmed, I... Oh, Ms. Graham, I didn't expect you until tomorrow. I lost your postcard, I'm afraid. How clever of Ahmed to find you. It was in the square, out there, you know. - I don't know how he knew I... - My dear, we never shall. He's so inscrutable. Just look at him now. He knows he's the most brilliant guide in Marrakesh. He understands every word I'm saying, by the way, though he'll only speak French. You see? I must give the marvelous creature something. Just a moment while I get my bag. My dear, you'll find the man indispensable. He knows everybody and everything. I don't know what I'd do without you. Thank you. Well... Ahmed to the rescue, as usual. - So sorry. - It didn't matter. It was quite an adventure. Arabs are so mysterious. Finchy, finchy... Although, between ourselves, I don't think he had the faintest idea who you were, at first. Just a tourist in trouble, he thought. And then it turned out you were coming here. But why didn't he say so? Wouldn't make him seem so clever. The East, my dear... and so is this. We're practically native here. Are you frightfully tired after your journey? I suppose you'd call this the drawing room. Do sit down. My sister had it until she died. She liked it best. But I'm still European enough to prefer sleeping upstairs. I'm utterly exhausted, I don't know why. That touch of asthma yesterday, I suppose. Is it good for you to smoke? Of course it isn't... but I can't give it up! I think I'm going to like you, Rose. Let's get on to Christian names at once, shall we? Call me Selena. I've never had a companion before, it seemed a frightful idea. But then when my sister died I felt lonely. And out here... Come upstairs and see your room. Finchy, finchy, finchies! What's that? That? That's where the houseboy sleeps. In there? When you've lived here a bit, my dear, you'll realize it's all they expect. I suppose you think I'm frightfully eccentric. Lots of people do. But it really doesn't matter. Here we are. Ah! Brahim brought up your cases. There's a good boy. - May I watch you unpack? - Of course. You're going to find me rather different from the Elliot children. I'll need a bit of cossetting, you know. Because I'm not as young as I was, and an old woman with asthma can be rather a trial. You're not old, Mrs. Prouse... Selena. You can't really think you're old. I want us to be two grown-up people with our own lives to lead. I want you to have time for yourself. That's very good of you. You must just tell me everything you want me to do, Selena, and I'll do it. Though I'll need a little time to learn your ways. Of course. You may need more than a little time for that, my dear. Oh, what a sweet little camel. Yes. John did it for me, John Elliot. Don't ride a camel, all the same. They make one terribly sore. May I look? I adore photographs. You wouldn't know any of the people, I'm afraid... except the Elliots. It's just my little album of all the families I've been with. There's John, on the left, with Mrs. Elliot, and with Ursula. And that's Lawrence, the elder brother, of course. He's growing up. The Pipers, Mrs. Elliot's cousins... did you know them? Know them? I nearly got engaged to colonel Piper once. Who's that? - Colonel Piper. - No! Well... perhaps it was his son. Selena wanted me to come shopping with her next morning. I saw the square again. The square that had been all people and drums and darkness. It was full of entertainers in the daytime. But I didn't see much of it. When Selena went shopping she had no time for distractions. What's that? - What? - The flag on the mosque. Oh, the call to prayer, my dear. That's the East, you know. They do it all the time. There's your guide. Doesn't he pray? I don't know. It's all so beautiful. I was wondering... perhaps he could show me around the city tomorrow. There's so much I'd like to see. If you could spare me, that is. Of course, my dear. Take the day off and do the grand tour. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. Go and catch him now. Oh, and ask him to find us a cal√®che. We must take all these parcels home. No. Now, I must get everything right. Out there, the big square... that's the Jemaa el-Fnaa? And the markets, with all the funny little streets... they're called the souks? Oh, Ahmed, look. Photo. Back. That's it. I have no change. Only 100 francs. You're a lucky boy. Now there were children again in my life. I used to see them nearly every day in the square. We couldn't say much to each other, but there's a common language in Morocco: the language of money. They always asked me for it, I remember, except little Brahim, the houseboy. And I knew their families must be poor... if they had any families. Little Brahim had no one. - Oh, you're back! Did you get my books? - Yes, they're in the drawing room. And take my watch to be mended? Yes. They said it would be at least a week. Top of the class as usual, my dear. Where are you having dinner? At a wonderful Arab restaurant. One sits on the floor in a converted palace Tayeb. Rose. "And they were both shocked by her voice, "hollow and toneless. "But Martin's voice was deep, and what he said seemed inevitable. "I noticed the thing near the window..." Selena! You know, another night like that and we'll be rich! Why, 30,000 francs... you're the terror of the casino! Am I really? Darling boy! Ahmed was very attentive the next few days, suggesting new places to visit, new things to see. Had he guessed already? Was it his way of watching me? I didn't care, that day he took me to see the tanners. By then, I knew. Ahmed, will you... will you do something for me? Will you... I want to see Tayeb... alone. Just once. Just to talk to him. Thank you. - One. - One. - Two. - Two. - Three. - Three. Good. Sky. No. "Tree". "Sky". It's very good. Afterwards... why didn't I feel ashamed? Having to pay Ahmed, having to pay Tayeb, who paid the old man who managed the dancers. But it was the custom of the country. And it didn't change anything. You mean to say you give that child 100 francs? Thank you. Rose? Is that you, Rose? Yes. I'm just going out. Never asked me. I'm terribly sorry. I quite forgot. But you said you were going out with Michele - so I thought... - Well I'm not. He phoned to say he couldn't. I wasn't going to be out long, if you'd... No. I'm not feeling very well, my dear, and I want you to read to me. - But I only... - I give you a lot of time to yourself, it's not fair of you to begrudge me a little favor. I'm sorry, Selena. - They were all being tortured. - Yes, I remember. "Joyce fought and struggled while the bloody agent, in his terrifying delicacy "felt with his pincers for her tongue. Then, madness..." Where were you going in your new dress? Nowhere special. "Then, madness seized her in its merciful grip, "and her last arabesque of agony was short. "Myrtle and Diana sobbed convulsively, and only half-consciously, "while the mangling chopper did its work, "delivered at last by vicious axe-strokes on the head. - "Ronald..." - I've changed my mind, you needn't go on reading, my dear. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. I'm probably going to sleep. You can run along, anyway, my dear. Thank you. Have fun! Tayeb, are you happy? I mean... But you like being here with me. Sometimes I think you must be tired of me because we can't really talk to each other, I mean. That's why I want to teach you. One... two... three... four... - five. - Tayeb. Let me get you a drink. Let's have a toast. I feel like a toast. - What on Earth for? - I don't know. Think of a nice one, darling. I know... let's drink to love. To love. You're not drinking, Rose. To love. All that night I kept telling myself how much I loved him. But I was frightened. It was impossible. I had to end it. I had to see him once more to say goodbye... and end it quickly... forever. Ahmed. I must see Tayeb today for the last time. It's very important. Disappeared? But he... he can't have disappeared. But where? Where's he gone? What's happened? Tayeb? Hello? Just a moment. It's our English Rose. Rose! We'd been wondering where you'd got to. If I upset you last night, my dear, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. It's not that, it's... Will you be very angry, Selena, if I asked you if I could have the rest of the day to myself? No, I shan't be angry. I'll be curious, though. Are you all right? Or has he been beastly to you? Men can be frightful! No, he... he's going away, you see, tonight. My poor Rose! He's going away. Of course you must stay with him, my dear. To the very last moment. How desperate for you! Don't worry about me. We're spending the day with Bancroft. And we'll probably go on to the casino tonight. Oh... thank you, Selena. Hey, ho! Parting is such sweet sorrow! Ahmed's note said that Tayeb had been turned out of the troupe. The old man was angry because he hadn't been paid enough commission on our meetings. He'd called him a thief, and no one knew where Tayeb had gone. You're sure? You're sure he's really gone? Where? Where is the village? But where? I've got to see Tayeb again, I've got to! Will you find out where the village is, Ahmed? Will you do that for me? I'll pay you. I'll be back in an hour. Meet me there, where the buses start. Understand? I'm trusting you. You must help me. Well? Azdan. Where is it? Yes, I'm going there. I'm going to Azdan. Azdan... Azdan. I kept saying it to myself like a magic word. Over the mountains, near the Sahara, Ahmed said it was... a long way away. And the bus left for the other side of the mountains early that morning. That moment felt like a beginning... leaving everything behind. And Tayeb, at the end of a long journey. I remember that little room in the Arab hotel. I remember asking myself: "what are you doing?" "What are you doing?" "You have a lover," I thought. "You are a thief." And somewhere in the village they were celebrating a wedding. All I knew was, I had to go on. Ahmed, the bus. We must hurry! For Marrakesh? Do you mean it's going back? You mean it doesn't go any further than here? But isn't there another one? But... I remember, we rode all that day. Everything was always further than they said. But when we came to the walls of the place they said was Azdan, I wasn't tired. I wasn't even excited. Ahmed went off without a word and stayed away a long time. But I was happy, waiting. Tayeb's gone? But... Isn't this Azdan? There were days when we saw no one. And there were days when Ahmed asked one of the women with painted faces and secret smiles for news of Tayeb. They said he'd gone to Azdan... and Azdan was a little further on. Everywhere was lonely and silent. Ahmed never suggested turning back, though he knew how little money I had left. Was it pride that made him stay? I wondered. Wanting to prove that he was right, that we'd find Azdan... and Tayeb would be there, as he'd promised? I never saw Ahmed again. I never knew him... why he appeared that first evening, why he left me at last without a word. And the drawing... was it his last effort at pretense? Or was it true? By now I had to believe it: by now I was lost. All I could do was to look for that mountain and see if the village beneath it was really Azdan. That was the end... the end of a dream. I died then. Eyomar arranged everything... arranged for Rose Graham to die and be buried forever. The people here believe everything is the will of God, and this I'm learning to accept. But sometimes I remember. I heard that music. And I remembered.
