My name is Sung Neng Yee. This is my story. You may not believe it all, but I lived every moment... and more. The years of my childhood were like a beautiful dream. I was a princess... Spoiled, pampered. Reigning over my every whim. When the Japanese overran all of Shanghai, they discovered my private kingdom. [war planes flying overhead] [music] [sounds of truck engines doors slamming, and soldiers running] Mama! [Asian talking] [crashing sounds] Mama... I'm afraid. [people crying] [Asian talking] [People screaming and crying] (NENG YEE) War stole my privileged childhood. It was gone like a leaf on the wind. [firecrackers] bang, bang, bang (NENG YEE) In the Chinese way of counting, 1950 was the Year of the Tiger. After such a long period of mind-defying violence. we were grateful to be alive and free. (DR. SUNG) What is the matter? Are you cold? (MRS. SUNG) Firecrackers..they've lost their magic. Too much like gunfire! Cheer up. Look for Neng Yee. She said she would be near the dragon. (NENG YEE) The Red flag seemed China's hope for the future. (NENG YEE) My parents... I'm home. Your daughter sends you love and best wishes for the New Year! Is this how it is going to be with you? What, Mama? This marching business? The Communists are Chinese. They have returned our country to us. We must show respect. Come, I have presents... (CHUNG SHIN) Did you have self-criticism this morning? (NENG YEE) Of course! (LING MEI) Did you stand up? Well, I couldn't think of anything really good so I promised to never wear lipstick again. Were you sincere? I was this morning. [laughter] ha, ha, ha! I'm starving! I heard the Communists have actually stopped all business on Euzhow Road. The red-light district? What about all the Singsong girls? They will be re-educated, of course! I don't think they excel because of their intellectual ability! Oh, boy! Western clothes! An upperclassman... Lam Cheng Shen. Hong Kong money. His family is very rich. Handsome, too. I'd forgotten men could look like that. Forget it! He's never dated anyone at school. A real loner... Give me a few weeks. I can change that. You wouldn't dare! A dinner date... within the month. Trapped by your own words. So bourgeois! If you lose, big mouth, you have to do my homework papers for a month! I'll get him to take me somewhere. The duties of a mother. You have money to gamble, Mama. Where did you get it? It is not appropriate for you to question me. Where? Tell me. An old silk scarf. Just a memento. We haggled over it for an hour. We got a good price. That was fun! Tell me, daughter, where would I wear it in these times. Hopelessly out-of-fashion! Perhaps we should have left China. I should have taken you out when the Japanese were defeated. Nonsense! Who would have expected it to go this way? Look! I will be a big potato for the Communists. You just watch, Okay? If the front door is locked, I'll go in through the back. You were not raised to be a "potato!" What a common expression. [talking on a bull horn] [whistle blows] [whistle blows] Neng! Look! His name. Lam Cheng Shen. "Volunteers are requested on Saturday to clean-up the grounds. Please do your duty for the betterment of all." Not on Saturday. Not me. I have a paper that is due. It is important to volunteer. We must show the proper spirit! Excuse me. Do you need help here? I have completed my assignment. (CHENG SHEN) No, thank you. I am nearly finished. I have heard it said that our great Chairman Mao does not approve of flowers for the new China. Perhaps he prefers weeds. We had beautiful flower gardens when I was a child. These were cut by mistake. It seemed a waste to see them tossed with the weeds. We have not been properly introduced, I apologize. What is it? Homework. Yes? Do you live here? What a surprise. I'm just selling concert tickets to benefit poor children. Chopin. I just knock on any door. Chopin. I'm sorry-- I'm leaving for Hong Kong. Oh, but the concert is two weeks away. You will return in time. I mean, surely you wouldn't miss two full weeks of classes. Your tickets-- are they expensive? I have a wonderful plan. Nylon stockings have disappeared from Shanghai. If you would consider making a purchase for me in Hong Kong. I would be most grateful. And in return for your kindness I will purchase two seats for the concert. The tickets will not cost you anything! That should be enough. You are asking me to buy nylon stockings? If it is not a problem for you, I would be most pleased. I suppose we should eat first. Dinner and a concert. It almost sounds like a "date." Thank you. You're welcome. It won't be expensive. I don't eat much. Hey, do you always carry so much money when you go shopping? Yahoo!! Your father is late. Something has happened. It takes longer now, Mama. It is not the bicycle. It was the raven at the kitchen this morning. Listen, Mama, you worry for nothing. Don't use that patronizing tone! I can read the signs. I'm going to see Shek Tong Ting. She'll convince you. (MRS. SUNG) He was born before dawn on September 1 1. 1900. A dark cloud hangs over him at this moment! Now do you believe me? (SOLDIER'S VOICE) You have brought deep shame to China... our soldiers are sickened to touch you or of your flesh from the decadent past... She is soft under her sweater. Like a young pigeon. Let go! You animal! Get away from me! What is it? She was escaping, Comrade. You do not look like a Singsong girl. My father is a very important doctor at Hwa Tung Textile Hospital. He did not come home for the evening meal. Your men detained me, Lieutenant, on my way to see what emergency has kept him from his family. Perhaps my men were over zealous. Our apologies, Sung Neng Yee. May I go now? Of course, but it is not wise to travel alone at night. Shanghai still contains many dark elements. It will take time to eradicate them all. Thank you, Lieutenant. Please my card. (SOLDIER'S VOICE) Seek the forgiveness of our great Chairman Mao. or you will be cast aside as worthless and empty-headed. Excuse me... I am the daughter of Dr. Sung. Is my father still on duty? Dr. Sung? He is not known to me. Not known to you? Impossible! He has practiced here for years. This hospital has many new doctors. You are inquiring about Dr. Sung? Where is he? Papa! You should not be here, Neng Yee! No, please! Papa, what are they doing to you? I am under "the submission of the people." Go home. Dr. Sung is a "clean man!" A patriot! He loves his country... No! No! Shut your mouth! You will only make it worse for Dr. Sung! Over population and modern technology are capitalism's own seeds of self-destruction. Eventually, machines will replace people in all professions and the masses will forget how to work. Their societies will collapse from within. That is why every citizen of China must experience labor training. The time is near when we will be classless a nation of laborists. You have something to say? Excuse me, sir, what provision is being made to protect the rights of the innocent-- those who have been or will be unjustly accused. Chairman Mao has repeatedly told us, "A revolution is not a dinner party!" Identify yourself! Tell me about your parents. Why? 'Cause, they are your family! Well-- my mother has small feet-- exceptionally small feet. My father has numerous concubines, and I don't know how many half brothers and sisters I have. Is that all you can say? Isn't that enough? I think you have built high walls about your life. Are you a student of Psychiatry now? She really did it! [piano music] Will you remove those ugly posters when we are gone? Your father stole large sums of money from the hospital. His crime is against the people. The truth must be published. Lies can be published too! The witnesses agreed. It is a matter of record. You have no confession from Dr. Sung! Neng Yee! It is enough. (NENG YEE) Our family's humiliation was eased when I graduated with honors from Soochow University-- the third highest in my class! The Communist professors could not ignore my achievements. I had forced their respect. It was exhilarating. My daughter tells me that you have been a great help with her studies. I doubt that she needed my assistance. I may have met your mother before the war-- at the French Club. It is possible. My mother found pleasure in gambling. Oh, I wish we could go there now and celebrate. Why? You would like to dine with ghosts? Well, if only ghosts came they would not charge us for the meal, would they! Do you always see friends to the door? Special days should never end. Why did you tell your parents I helped you with your studies? I just wanted them to be in your debt. But for what purpose? Couldn't we go inside? The walls have ears. I share the flat with two other families. [music] [soldiers chanting] Let's go. The old palace is just up the road. The Governess used to take me for very controlled walks along this street. Tuesday afternoons and Friday mornings. We were always on schedule. A "controlled walk?" What's that? Shirley and I were in the wagon. The Governess was forced to pull! Shirley? Who's Shirley? She was an American movie star about my age. It was bombed during the war, but completely restored. I'm glad they didn't change it. A big general lives there now. You always find a joke in everything. [Classical piano music] [Upbeat piano music] Boogie Woogie! [romantic music] Happy smile! [laughter and giggles] Kissing in the new China is not only in questionable taste but quite possible unhealthy. That was in the paper this morning. Doesn't that depend on the parties involved? Ouch! I just laid on a rock. It's not a rock! It's an egg. Two dozen, I think. It's an old custom to bring us luck. Did they have to be red? It's the color of fertility. They've already worked their magic. We'll have them for breakfast. Neng Yee, Promise me something. Anything... Teach our son to laugh! [laughter] ha, ha, ha My name is Lam Neng Yee. I have been given the opportunity of teaching you two courses-- History and Political Science. You have been selected to study here because you are all brilliant soldiers. Now our government is giving you the opportunity to be brilliant scholars, as well. This will be an intensified course. You will gain six years of knowledge in three! But I have instruction now. As a matter of policy all teachers here are being examined. How is that possible, Colonel? Why did you family stay in Shanghai when your relatives were fleeing with their personal fortunes? When the stock market collapsed and all money was converted to Japanese yen we became refugees in out own city. But still my father would not leave China! May I please have some water? At what age did your parents enroll you in the McTyler Christian School? Nine or ten, I'm not certain. Why did they send you to a missionary school? I don't know... for the instruction. Isn't it logical to suggest that they did this because they had strong Christian sympathies? They are not religious. My father had some Catholic instruction in France. but I've never known him to pray. And then after the war you were enrolled in a boarding school-- also Christian. The Mary Farham School. It was Presbyterian. It rated very high academically. Is that when you became a Christian? I was young... impressionable. It didn't stick! It was just something you did when you were in school. Why do these questions make you uncomfortable? My baby resists sitting so long. She married a man from Hong Kong. He brought her nylon stockings. He smuggled them into China. Thank you. Smuggling is a serious offense. This will take consideration. First, write about your life at the Mary Farnham School. Reconsider every event in your time with the Presbyterians. You must return all paper that is used. Even the false starts. But my family, My baby-- I must go home. Consider this a chapter in your autobiography. The more you write, the sooner this matter will be closed. (NENG YEE Speaking) In China, the family name gives meaning to a person. I write this with true awareness that the history of my family is of deeper importance than who I have become. After the defeat of the Japanese in 1945, my father brought us back to our beloved Shanghai. I was 13 years old... Many of my classmates wore gold crosses about their necks I did not want to say that I was not a Christian so I told them I was saving my neck for a string of perfectly-matched pearls! At first I had difficulty keeping pace with my classmates. The teachers often spoke of the Bible and Jesus Christ in a most natural way. As if He were more than a historical figure. I found this puzzling, but I dismissed it. My studies demanded all my attention. Your writing is too specific. As if you were hiding something. Fiction can perhaps be more rambling in style. I am not a writer of fiction! (NENG YEE Speaking) A self-criticism and confession are the first steps to social reform, I will attempt to explain my involvement with Christianity at this impressionable age. It began like a tiny seed planted in my spirit. I was away from my parents and lonely for something. Living God, can you hear me? Please help me claim You as my friend. (NENG YEE Speaking) At a time of personal stress. I did profess to be a Christian. It was the night before we faced the Middle School entrance exams. The strong emphasis on high test scores made me apprehensive. [singing] (NENG YEE Speaking) By the time I reached 16 years. the Christian God was forgotten. I now look to our great Chairman Mao for instruction and guidance! Religion will ultimately disappear from human history. But it will be a slow process of re-education. Old ideologies and cultural habits from the past cannot be eliminated in one generation. The era of pure Communism is a prize for the future. That will be China's millennium! For now, it must be determined if you are worthy to assist us in our goals. Will it always be unfair like this? Perhaps you should write again in more detail! I am about to give birth, Colonel. My baby needs adequate rest. The softness of your past is most evident. You are preparing your baby for life! I talked to You when I was a child. Do You remember my name? Comrade, good evening. I am hoping to request a small favor. You see, I have a friend who teaches here. We had a terrible argument. I need to see her to patch things up. Classes are completed for today. My friend is a serious Party member- very dedicated. Hours mean nothing to her. In fact, that's why she keeps me waiting. Her name is Lang Neng Yee. If you could check... The Admissions Office opens at 8 o'clock. Passes are issued there! How can you sleep so late? An indulgence of the lazy capitalist class. The revolutionary masses have been at work for hours. The Colonel is not here? He has more important duties. May I please request some water? Just a glass of water. You must learn self-discipline. I have nothing further to confess. We will help you to remember. [Chinese command] We demand a full confession of your counter-revolutionary activities. You will begin by admitting that you are a Christian! If it were true, what is the crime? Our constitution guarantees religious freedom for all the people. You play games! [Chinese command] You accepted an honored teaching position wearing a mask of lies! Did you intend to infiltrate the minds of our brave soldiers with your decadent beliefs? That is absurd. [Chinese command] Why did you marry a man from Hong Kong who is not a member of the Party? I came to love him... Love is a bourgeois conceit! It has no place in this classless society. You speak of a classless society, yet you deliberately separate those whose background was more privileged than your own. My background? Explain yourself! Whore! Your manner of speaking-- the cutting way you express yourself-- Maybe the custom in Northern China but not here. You betray yourself! We must eat from the same rice bowl! You will answer "yes" or "no" to my question. Are you a Christian? He may be distant from me, but I will not deny His presence. Yes or no? Yes... Comrade, could I trouble you to call and check and see if she is still working? She hasn't been home for three nights. You understand the problems men have. I need to see her. You are crazy and weak to let a women have that power over you. Put your mind and energies to your duties. You are allowed two minutes. God... I am unable to think. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil... for Thou are with me." Women, they're always a problem, right? The hours are long till morning, huh? She has probably found a new friend and not bothered to tell you. Please forgive me for my years of silence. Help Cheng Shen... my parents... But my heart is with my child. Oh, God, is this a sin against my baby? [gunshots] bang, bang, bang [remembering gun shots] bang, bang, bang It has been determined that it was some form of electrical disturbance-- A freak storm. Colonel, I respectfully request the opportunity to speak to someone who was there... Perhaps one of the soldiers. Why? To what purpose? I would like to ask-- If they observed a lightening bolt from heaven? To explain... words seem too small. Why would the Christian God create a miracle for you? Since you do not claim Him. Perhaps, He remembers more than our minds can hold. You have been released from your teaching position here. I am sorry for that. I regret my appearance. May I go home, Colonel? My time is near. Fifty six days maternity leave is granted to all the new mothers of China. But first you will give attention to another chapter in your autobiography. This time you will write about your husband... [water bag breaks and water leaks out] Nurse, When can I see a doctor? You are number 27, The Doctor is seeing 14. Patience. First babies take their time. Remember when I was a little girl you told me I must be the first to walk on the moon? Because no one ever remembers the second. Where is Cheng Shen? Why isn't he with me? I have told you. They keep him at the Courts at night. Sometimes until after 1 1:00. Mama, listen to me! Of all the stories I have told you, this one is the most true. I have a promise from God that we will all escape from China. I don't know how, but I have His promise. We will be free! Of course, darling. He spoke very clearly. It wasn't a dream! Oh, mama... mama...mama! It's all right... it's going to be all right, darling. [groaning and pushing sounds] I want Chain Man to see flowers and green grass. You think he'll remember? Here. He smiled. May I ask you a private question? This is about as private as Shanghai gets. Today, the mother of my son can ask me anything! Do you still believe in God? It's amazing how your mind works... God? You mean in the Christian sense? Mao cut out his tongue years ago. I still hear His voice. In the wind, no doubt. You are so handsome. Absolutely perfect ears, and a wonderful, distinctive nose... Lam Sung Neng Yee? What is it? Only six more days. They want me back. Mama, I have to find milk! ...bus 42. Central line, please. Ah, the baby-- a boy or girl? I bet your first. How old? A boy and yes, my first. Seven weeks. You worry about leaving him so soon. He needs milk. I don't know when I can be with him. The stores in our district have been out for weeks... My shift ends in twenty minutes. You wait! We'll talk about the milk. We meet on market days. No one pays attention. (Pastor) "The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?" The Scriptures tell us that we are "children of the light." We see and hear what our tongues can not always speak. Let us offer a silent praise. What shall we sing? "Take My Life And Let It Be." [singing in silence as not to be heard] [music] This sister is being criticized by the authorities. She has an urgent need for milk for her son. I can bring fresh milk from the country every Wednesday. (Woman) She must have some powdered milk too. Carrying it so far-- The milk can sour. (Another woman) All powdered milk is exported. But I have a friend who works in the government store. I will speak to her. Today, you will write the history of your husband. With respect, Colonel, I'm not that acquainted with his personal history. Recall for us every conversation from your first meeting. There is particular interest in the money deposited each month in your account from Hong Kong. A small amount. It comes from his family. How else would we survive? You! You come up! Come! You come up. You! You, back there! You forgot this last night. Don't be so careless next time. Thank you. Mama! I have milk. Powdered milk! Oh, you found it. He just went to sleep. I miss touching you. I measure each second that we are alone like chapters in a book. He will have no childhood. Cheng Shen, I have a plan! Don't you tell me anything! They compare our stories. We must keep a low profile-- live longer! What else did you bring back from Hong Kong besides stockings? I told you. I bought possibly two shirts-- pajamas. Why did you choose that particular restaurant before the concert? I checked the menu. The prices seemed fair. Where did you buy so many phonograph records you keep in your apartment? I was a collection from over the years. What was the exact amount of the bill for your dinner? I don't remember. How can it matter? Why did your father have so many concubines? Do all rich men have such an appetite for sex? Is your mother without passion? Be silent! Cheng Shen! I am ready to lie, but I don't know what to lie about. What have they done to you? I wanted to see if it would still fit. I can hear you playing the piano. Two keys are stuck. It is driving you crazy! Stop it! Stop it! How did we ever find each other? I knew you were mine the first time I saw you. You play "what if" because "what is" is to impossible to confront. Today the temptation came to give them what they want and let them win...so that I can lose. It would all be over. Don't look at me! [NENG YEE Thinking] They bend us like saplings in the wind. Our separations are more eloquent than our meetings... I wonder, will we ever again dare to be graceful together? I know you value a trusting heart. But Cheng Shen is drowning in some private despair. Please forgive this little push... if it is wrong. Wednesday's the market day. I always try to go. The vegetables come straight from the fields. Do you shop there? I don't know that I'll be free Wednesday. Would you mail this for me? To Hong Kong. Ticket! When did you last see your father? My father? He has been detained at the clinic. Several months... I'm not sure as to the exact date. Dr. Sung recently contacted the flu. He has been removed to the hospital for observation. Perhaps you should visit him. Colonel, I respectfully seek your permission. Papa... so, they're treating you like a big shot. Private room for a flu patient. Your Mother? She's worrying about you. Never letting Chuin Man out of her sight. You know Mama. Promise, Neng Yee, promise you will take care of her! Maybe they'll let you come home at last. It's only the flu, Papa. You have always been blessed with strong dreams. As much a son as daughter to me. Papa... They're experimenting with a new drug. It causes extensive bleeding. Nurse! Nurse! We need help! [NENG YEE speaking] Our daughter, Chuin Way, was one month old when Papa left us. The crime was murder without proof of intent. We have to take what happens. Swallow the bitterness. Oh, God, I confess to you that my faith is small. Not all of us will escape the fire unscathed. Some will stumble so that we will be refined and purified for His purpose. When you plant melon seeds, you harvest melons. When you plant bean seeds, you get beans. When you plant seeds of faith, you find God! I want to thank you for helping my babies. and for helping me. This is our sister of the Firing Squad. China has seen many things that some of us would call "miracles" since the Revolution. He has given me a message for our sister. Our Lord has asked you to trust Him for one day at a time. The days will become weeks, and weeks into months and months will fall into years. one day at a time. [screaming and shouting] Do not resist. Do not resist. [screaming and shouting] Word has just reached me that your husband has made a full confession to our charges of espionage. A spy! Guilty of conspiring with foreign governments. They told me that you made a full confession that I was a spy... Lies... that I betray my country... Lies... Lies... They said that you were very convincing. Lies! It's okay... it's okay. It's impossible. Not now. Reality, Mama. Reality is always possible. I'll go to Shek Tong Ting. I'll buy the strongest potion of ginseng and you must go to the Bath House and sit in a tub of scalding water. It's past the time for potions, Mama. It's already the second month! Oh, you had a letter from Hong Kong this morning. Where is it? There. Why didn't you tell me? Because you make my heart stop! His father is dying, Colonel. He asks to see his son for the last time! My mother-in-law has enclosed a certificate signed by the Doctor. I respectfully request a 30 day exit permit for my husband to visit his father at this time of sadness. What assurance can you offer that he will return in 30 days? I will be your assurance. His parents have never seen their grandchildren. I humbly request that his daughter be allowed to accompany him. Your husband has been assigned to a camp where he will experience labor reform. All educated people should learn how to work with their backs. Could that order not be postponed for 30 days. Colonel? How do you know he won't abandon you? I have his son. Family ties remain important even in the new China. And I am two months pregnant. Having children is proof that we are alive-- that we have worth! Don't be a dreamer. They will never let you go. I will come back. No! You must not even consider it. I may not see you again while I am still in my twenties. Perhaps even my thirties. Please wait for me! If I am in my forties, Mama always said a touch of gray was becoming. I hope you'll agree. I have instructions for Chuin Way. A safe journey for your husband and daughter. The penalty for escaping to Hong Kong is a minimum of ten years in prison. I am not escaping, Colonel. It has been decided that you will serve you husband's term as forced labor until he returns. I hear you were once a teacher. Chemistry was my subject--1 7 years! We don't talk here. But I miss intelligent conversation. They work us like animals, but what is in our minds will not go away. Don't help me. Stay back! I am here to apply for an exit permit. I intend to visit relatives in Hong Kong during my 56 day maternity leave. You should have applied months ago. Your baby will be sitting up before the applications are stamped by all the official agencies. But will I be permitted to fill out the "appropriate forms?" The forms are easy. The procedure is difficult. Any news for Lam Neng Yee? My exit permit? Oh, yes. I have news for you. Go to the bathhouse. You smell like a beggar! I will return in two days! I told you, you're dreaming. Two days! Lam Neng Yee? Report to the medical section. I haven't felt the baby move for two days now. The heartbeat is strong. There is evidence of a kidney infection. That is why you are retaining fluids. The nurse will give you some vitamin C tablets. Could you have miscalculated the time? Your ninth month? Yes. The baby will not be born in China! Then where? I forgot to ask. Somewhere free... I don't understand why God should speak to you directly. Because nobody else could deliver the message! I read a book once about Christian saints in the Middle Ages. They spoke like you. I have His promise, Mama! Has He promised to keep you alive in that hell hole? (Guard 1) The old cow is slowing down. (Guard 2) That baby's going to get dumped with the rocks. How can you find the strength? "You tell the world the Communist Party has brought freedom to China. I want to go to Hong Kong to see my father-in-law who is dying. You will not let me go! I am using my 56 days maternity leave to go so it will not interfere with my labor training job. You have no reason not to grant me an exit visa. Please check with other departments to see what they are doing about my application." It is over 21 words, you lose the rate. Very expensive for you. Every word is important. I will pay! Where do you want this to go? To our great Chairman Mao Tse Tung. To Zhou Enlai, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Central Police in Beijing. I don't have a name. You want to send 3 telegrams to Beijing each 91 words? I have cash. Let me check your count. You again! Don't ask! Just Go! Why is it nobody in Shanghai has any answers. I have to go to the top of the ladder. You can go where you want to go just as long as it's away from here! Top of the ladder! You! The fat one! Out! Go back! Go Back! It's bad enough that you use that old gimmick of your maternity leave. In 56 days you could go around the world. Then I would be back in Shanghai, Captain. Cunning like a beggar too, huh? Beijing has called us twice about your application. This office has been unduly criticized. You have caused us to lose face! Sign! Report to this address. I was about to have tea. Please, sit. Come. I assumed your children would grow up under the Red flag. You have had capitalistic ideas from birth -- but your children... Perhaps it was a personal goal. You've served your husband well. I would be pleased for the opportunity to express that personally. That may be possible, Colonel. One day... A higher authority has granted your exit permit. It is known, of course, that you will not return to China. Only God knows... China is my home. Please take your God with you. Tell Him it is His last chance to escape. Within a decade He'll be locked away in a museum. To do that, Colonel, you would have to imprison the wind! Safe journey. (NENG YEE'S VOICE) You will come, Mama. I have His promise! Let me go now. Please. A way will open for you... Oh! Chuin Man! Chuin Man! Look! I'm going out there. Neng Yee! You made it in your 20's after all. Look at us. I am so ashamed. I missed your presence. When our son is born, I promise to be young again. You won, Neng Yee. You won for all of us.
