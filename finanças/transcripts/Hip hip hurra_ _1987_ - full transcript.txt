Game over. Come back, damn it! Get out of the boat! "There is no sorrow" he cried out as he went down to the beach. - There he is! - Get out of the boat! Get out of the boat! - What is he yelling? - He is not yelling, but laughing. I'm getting nervous. We're about to meet Søren Krøyer. I don't even know how he looks like. Maybe he's an old geezer. I heard he's long, blonde, and that the women fancies him. The only way to get to Skagen... If you arrive by boat you have to be carried to land. I read in a book once... This headland is the ocean in nature that is constantly under threat. This applies to us as well. It seems to wonderful. As long as you make it. Søren remained on the beach for two days. He is still in a lethargy on this, the third day. Welcome! Welcome to the outer headland! Here I am with Christian Krohg. I am very fond of him! We've met before, do you remember? I vividly remember that exhibition. I liked your paintings but you didn't like mine. I'm happy you're here. Eilif is here somewhere. He arrived three weeks ago. He's up there with food prepared. The woman with her is Märta Johansen. Her husband is also a painter. But he stays home with the children. We haven't seen such a man for ages. I have to see. Sorry to disturb you. I once loved a man. It's the first I will tell you. He died. I wear his shoes! The clothes are from people who pitied me. You look like Paulus when he came to Rome. I'll sleep here tonight as well. I'll take your blanket. Sometimes I think someone sent me. Just to show what a happy man really is. I'm trying to adjust to this idea. - Lille wants to discuss something. - No, no, it can wait. But I have something I want to tell you as soon as you have time. She looks angry. And austere. And so warm. One desire her. Like a study in nude, but it's merely a face. She is here, Krohg, so watch your tongue. I later went to visit Anna and Michael. We smiled at Krohg's meeting with Martha. As I left they sat in their usual way and reviewed work. The three of us were the only people who lived all year in Skagen. I was an organist and lived in a room next to the church. One night Søren came to visit me. One night only. I think I'm expecting a child. I haven't told him. Excuse me. You don't know me. My name is Viggo Johansen. I have painted the portrait of my wife Martha. I would very much like to have it back. I couldn't sleep. We live in Vesterby, so it's far to walk, but... I was so upset. I'm not angry. Perhaps I should feel flattered. But as I was saying, I couldn't sleep. Sometimes it's pure magic to paint. Yes, but I prefer music. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I think it's enough for today. Viggo. Almost two hours. It's chaos in there. It just wasn't possible. No! Two hours! Now I have to work all night. - You're not planning to do laundry? - I'm trying to paint your portrait. But he was laying on the bed and watching you. - Who? - Krohg. Did you visit Krohg? Tonight? I returned the portrait. Back to us. Don't move. - Yes, but the children... - Could thank us for their existence. I came to apologize. It was reckless. The portrait I mean. Never mind. I guess Mr. Krohg fell in love. - May I offer you something? - No thank you, we're just passing by. How beautiful you painted this. It is as alive as a human being. Have you spoken with Søren? - It's not what they think, Anna. - Neither what you think. Shall I wear it and be your model? If I take this the length will be perfect. No need to worry, Anna. Soon enough strange things will happen. I haven't spoken with him. I never saw such a happy person. Søren says that the paint in the shadows and light is equal in Skagen. Here it's all black. You see, I don't have... You see, no head. No head. That's were he is. Michael, am I ugly? No, Christian, you have a magnificent face. Your nose is that of a king. Frederick the Great's nose was crooked. And the eyes? One can tell you're trying to see, but are unable to. You have a rough line here. It makes you cockeyed. Your eyes look like the ones of an explorer, or an adventurer. But you're thin and narrow here. Your temple reminds me of a suicidal person. People with such temples are usually nervous and oversensitive. Even many holy men. Mikael. Here are you. Here am I. Anna. Oscar. Five fingers on one hand. One can't make it alone. But together... Careful, it's not dry. - Is it the sky? - Yes. A toast to us! Because we exist! Hip, hip... You can't imagine how beautiful you are. I'll stand over there. Oscar! Go and make me a sketch. Look at me, Lille. We'll remember this. Tomorrow we'll find a photographer! Krohg says he's not here because of the beauty. To portray those who God forgot. So big. So big. Lille, show Ingeborg how to pose. Pout with your stomach. Out with it. Lean it forward. Jump in the water. The perception of the room mirrors how we perceive society at large. The time of dark paintings are over. - Europe no longer use... - Screw Europe. - Only Brandes has contacts in Europe. - It's best to stay away from Europe. I'm currently painting an old man. A real old fucker, really. He's resting now. On a chair next to him is his pipe. It's not even beautiful. You'd rather not pant that, if you consider Europe. Europa! Where the hell is that? Look what Søren made! Not only did he paint Brandes, but also us when he painted Brandes. How does it feel to fly, when everyone else walk the ground? Do you even know what a sore is? You're walking so fast. I can barely follow. You've got guests from Copenhagen, haven't you? It will be difficult. It may seem as a shame to be lucky as you. You are like a white bird up there. My neck aches by watching you. You have to paint your sorrow. It's urgent. Paint your misfortune. I only paint that which I see. You are like the air and wind. Soon you'll become invisible. You know I am fond of you. You'll perish as air turning into air. God is my only master, I know what I'm talking about, Søren Krøyer. Paint it black! Paint it black! Paint it black, Søren Krøyer! You know, she's insane. Even more so than usual. Are you also scared of me, Søren? Paint it black! - Did you tell him that? - Almost. I asked if he wanted to make my portrait. - Why? - I thought it was a good beginning. - Well, did he want to? - No. - Nothing was said? - Not yet. But now, as things are so dire, you have to tell him. It's not only about you, Lille. It's not only about you, Lille. Krohg had started being on his own. No one dared to speak with him. He bought a hawk from a sailor. The hawk doesn't want to fly. And he won't eat. It was raining for weeks. A fell of sin. - Are you saying he wants to leave? - He can't. Carl already left. I think Oscar should take off his sun bonnet. You're not to blame for the rain. Don't leave, then everyone will. No one can leave. Fly away! Or you'll die. - Why do you live here? - I might not stay around. It's quite lonely. But you've lived here for 15 years. I wanted to grant my life a higher meaning. I used to live in Böhmen. One day I left. And the road ended here. You have a few cats as well. Or, they have me. No kids? There's no big difference between them and us. They fly above the sea when the sun shines. But the rain starts. They turn wet and heavy. It's far to the shore. They colonize on the top of a pole. But they grow cold and freeze. And so they loose confidence and can no longer descend. The one I bought is in the woodshed. He doesn't have the courage. You don't have to shoot small birds in the gardens. I won't shoot anymore. He doesn't want them. Kittens - Are you going to give them kittens? - He has to eat. A hawk won't fly by eating dead animals. This hawk will fly again. You told me yesterday you needed money. I won't discuss money with you. You auction all your paintings. I won't to buy the painting of Tine and the cradle for 300 crowns. It's worth 3000. And I don't need 3000. Newly born kittens are blind. They haven't seen life. They are born out of darkness and return to it. We murder and we live. That's the way it is. The party is over. It's all over, Søren Krøyer. No one no longer has the patience to love. Tomorrow is Sunday, and I'm born on a Sunday. Tomorrow the sun will shine! Sun, sun, sun! Sun, sun, sun. Today is Sunday. You can hunt tomorrow. I don't want to wear the drapery. - Eilifs birthday today! - Who gives a damn. I'm going hunting. I will not tell you a secret. Come, before he wakes up. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Eilifs Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Suddenly it was too much. "Queen for a day" as the saying goes. - No, No! - Stand still! Congratulations! I heard it was a boy. He turned out a bit eccentric, not like others. But quite lovely. One day I shall paint a woman like you. Who wouldn't want that. Have you seen Mikael? He went home to get his rifle. - Don't you dance, Mr. Krohg? - Mr. Krohg doesn't dance today. Isn't it a bit dark here? My vision is as good night as day. I can fire a gun in my sleep. Ask my name. My name is Ingegärd. From Stockholm. I'm an artist. This is not about art, but about death. Not towards the house. Startle it and make it fly away from the house. It doesn't fly. - I'm done. - It doesn't fly. - It doesn't fly? - It will never fly. - That's why it has to die. - I'm not shooting a sitting bird. If it flew, you'd shoot it. Because it wants to live. This is not thought through. You don't shoot a sitting bird. You'll have to kill it with a stick. You don't hit a sitting hawk with a stick. I can do it. We had hens when I was small. Hens! This is... Where are you from, by the way? What the hell are you doing here? Life goes on. If you'd want to live, it'd be the death of you. Søren! It doesn't fly, but it lives. Søren, this way. It's not possible. It isn't? I can't paint these kind of faces. No. But... People are not happy by watching such faces. Why make them happy, then? Don't you understand? You've been close to me, Søren. For one night. I won't forget. For three months and three years. But I wasn't naked. I would like that you saw me naked. I don't want to. There is a "now" and there is a "never". You didn't tell me that you carried his child. He couldn't paint my portrait. What are you going to do? If you never tell him. He cannot leave me. Our meeting resembled a wedding. Don't be an idiot. I have to take the child. What am I supposed to do? He's leaving. He said "terrible", but he loves me. I know. One just knows. This is only the beginning! We haven't met much as the summer is coming to an end. We lives in the outskirts. Yes. - It wasn't for me to just come. - No. And three children requires time. I was expecting my fourth. I was foolish to say that. I don't know what to say. It smells of dust. Thank you for escorting me, Lille. Sometimes it's all just damned. What am I to do here? This is madness. - Did they leave this on purpose? - They are always here. They belonged to a woman who lived here during the 18th century. It's bad luck to take them. Then I'll take them. To remember. Close the door! Did you hear? Søren Krøyer has married in Paris... With Marie Triepcke. It was written in the papers that she's one of Denmark's most beautiful women. God will grant you everything, Søren Krøyer. I learned something while I stayed in Paris, Mikael. Paintings depicting everyday life bore me. That's all. You know... All of Paris wanted her. But in the end I was the one who got her. She might not stay long this summer. Marie wants to travel to Germany. You think I play too loud. But I want you to hear! Welcome! Did you hear the music? - No, 1300. - 1600. We agreed on 1600 initially. There was a cow around back then. 1600. Wasn't it supposed to be a birthday gift? - Yes. My wife was born there. - So she'll be happy. I liked it better when there was a cow... here. But it'd be even more beautiful if it was... here. - Here? - Yes. - Can you finish it by 9 o'clock tomorrow? - Certainly. She's staying for a while, Viggo. She's here to help me. No, no payment is necessary. - She can't make ends meet. - And the child? It died. She went all the way to America. Two years passed, Viggo. It couldn't stay alive. Perhaps it wasn't meant to. Release the boy, Lille! Welcome, Lille. Is he in Copenhagen? Søren is in Italy. You're supposed to paint a cow. If we're meant to live through Christmas then you need to paint a cow. Has Mr. Krøyer never fail with a motive ? No. Why, yes. Once. With a portrait. A woman I know. Why didn't it succeed? It proved too difficult. But with us it will succeed? You are more simple. Much less real. What do you mean by that? Don't fool me into thinking. I want to see, not think. Why would we be so simple? You are exactly what you seem to be. A bunch of the richest in Scandinavia. Nothing to laugh about, gentlemen. To think is pointless. Do you know what Drachmann says about you? He says that it's a shame; a real talent like yourself, proves to be so stupid. You remind him of a sketch that he once saw, he says. It depicted a headless bosom That played the flute. Are you finished soon? I now know how I want it. I'll paint them in this light. So that the gold will shine? Have you thought about something. You never kiss me. I kiss you, yet you never kiss me. You have chalk on your lips. I haven't seen you naked, neither. I'll be ready soon. I want to see you naked. - Let us not talk about that here. - Then when? Never. I heard that Drachmann called you a headless devil. That plays the flute. I've never got such a nice compliment. You are so childish, Søren. - Is Søren that rich? - Yes. - What's the name of their child? - Vibeke. - I miss Skagen. - I do too. It's so dark here. So many ugly trees with small birds that quirks. Don't look at me like that. One Elsie from Copenhagen... It was Søren's mother. Mother! Mother! Søren still thought of life as a feast. But I saw that he was about to have too much of it all. Mother! Søren suffers from a strange kind of dizziness these days. It was my birthday. We were planning a dinner party. Søren had been on the ladder for hours. Kröhg is visiting Skagen. He'll be here tonight. Mr. Krøyer, can he be here today as well? Thank you, Mr. Krøyer. Thank you for making him so happy. The previous night, Søren said: "There is no sorrow, Marie. What exist is that, which we can see. "Everything else is imagination." Søren was laying and observed Nol. Nol never started to speak. He can only utter sounds. Søren says that Nol is condemned to eternal childhood. Nol started to visit every day. He is given bolts by Søren while he is in the studio painting. Søren... We have to greet each other properly. This is my wife, Oda. Søren should have mentioned this. We're not only celebrating Marie's birthday -but also welcoming our new neighbours. Friends, who very quickly won our heats. It feels like we know you forever already. Cheers, Henny and Hans, to eternal friendship. We've come to ask for some money, Søren Krøyer. A few hundred. We have no money at all. God damn. I don't know you. I can't remember. How different it can be. We remember you. A great party at the Academy for the great painter Søren Krøyer. 200 people in tailcoats. And you can't remember us. Could it really be so? We're disgusted by your paintings, Søren. A few hundred. A mere loan. What? Perhaps I could purchase something you've made. - You're not buying any of our paintings. - We're not painting as beautiful as you. - We don't want to. - Everything is not beautiful, right? I'm asking you. Look at me, damn it. Is everything beautiful? Is it? Look at me, damn it! I asked how much they paid you for the painting. - I would love to know. - Answer him! Look at him! We are your friends, your colleagues. It feels good to see you on your knees, Søren Krøyer. Damn good. I'm flying. It's all very real. Don't. I said "don't". Mother, I'm done now. Father promised to go bicycle with me. But he's always playing. Yesterday he forced me to stand here for this double portrait In front of that big mirror over there I cannot bear looking at it. I've already told you about Bonacci. But I didn't mention that she stole my wife's dress. One dark evening he went down to the beach and spread it out there. Then he lit it on fire. He was down there by the sea, squatting. An ugly little man. And lit fire to a silk dress that belonged to Denmark's finest woman. Did you really see it with your own eyes? Not exactly. But these things you just know. When Bonacci died it was winter. Just as it is now. He was not found for months. But eventually he was found. The hens had devoured his face. I feel good today. I can return home tomorrow. - Bonacci isn't dead, he's alive. - I know that. Imagine that winter already arrived. Is my wife in Copenhagen? She's in Italy. Anyway, I shall be leaving tomorrow. Don't tell me why you're silent. I don't want to know. I've never felt better. Last time you left too early. In a month, perhaps. It could even be longer, Søren. I want to live like a child, Lange. Is that why you think I'm ill? No. I understand you. A child, Lange. A child. We've come to visit you, Søren. It's the first day. So many of you. Søren, look who's here! I've been missing it. Skagen is the best place to live. Welcome home, Søren. Welcome home. It is our friend. I'm Søren. This is Hugo Alvén. He'll stay with us this summer. For you who don't know him, he's a Swedish composer. And a wonderful, talented person. I thought you might be needing a bicycle. You can have mine. It's a nice bicycle. Is it too windy for you here in Skagen? I like the wind, but sometimes... The light is enhanced. Many share your opinion. Can you play something for me? Are you already here? We have an understanding. No more hypocrisy, you said. This is no good. They're laughing at you. They consider you some sort of fool. Then I guess they're right. I've never really understood anything. Do you think she will leave with him? I think he's terrible. The feet are too small, and with shiny shoes. You don't have to hold my hand at all times. That's enough, Søren. Do everyone agree to offer Søren Krøyer, -who was born in a madhouse in Stavanger, to return to Norway as a king? Do you, Peder Severin Krøyer, also known as Søren, accept this offer? Søren, are you listening? Søren, where is Vibeke? Yes, Vibeke. Have you seen Marie? No, she always tell me where she's going. You cannot go alone. As if no one ever lived here. As if we imagined it all. You came at a bad time. I saw you! This is it! This is it, Søren Krøyer! They're leaving. - Do you want some coffee? - Yes please. No, no, not today. Not today. No. Come. Come. Not today. I don't think I can bring all my clothes when I depart. I'd like to marry the two of you. I'm serious. But I'd also like to kill you. You better return home. You're done here. Tomorrow, then. Yes. I better go packing my things. This is actually the first time during the whole summer that we are alone. Is Vibeke with Henny? Are you expecting visitors today? I love you, Søren. There was no boat. Yes, they've departed. I guess they took the train. They're gone for good. That's what I'm trying to say. To talk about boats or trains is senseless. You just wander into the sea and then disappear. Michael painted Søren as he promised. When I heard that Søren was dead I painted my daughter in Copenhagen. Krohg was standing in Oslo. He painted an empty chair. Marie lived in Vasastan in Stockholm. He had recently bought herself a dog. The last thing I remember... Is that I arranged a meeting with Lille on the beach. Why couldn't it start to rain. People. Death. The death. On the beach I hear someone say -that he never felt such a warm wind. It was on this beach that you touched my bosom. I leaned back towards you and closed my eyes. What I see in front of me... Is more honest. And worse. It was something about the strange positions we were in. I couldn't move. And you said, "all meat is hay." I gave him something invisible. I told him... That it was all very easy. Why is it so cold? Why won't they talk to me? Then I understood. The day had changed. This is a very different day on the beach. The wind is blowing. And I no longer exist. They can't see me. Even though I don't exist -I still try to stand up. Subtitles by voice Karagarga Subtitling Division (c) 2022
