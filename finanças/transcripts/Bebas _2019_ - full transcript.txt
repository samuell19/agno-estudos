Okay Asih, please clean up the table. Yes, Ma’am Good afternoon, Ms. Vina Afternoon, nurse. Thank you for the chocolate yesterday. I got your gift, How do you call it? Louie Peeton… I love it. Thank you, my dear. No, don’t move me to a VIP room. It’ll be too quiet. It’s nicer here, the other ladies keep me company. Okay, you have a meeting to attend. Okay. Peace be upon you too. Ladies, look what I got from my son-in-law. Lou It’s Louie Peeton! My Adi is amazing. God bless him. Please excuse Adi for not visiting, Mom. He’s just busy with work. No worries, he’s a busy man, I totally understand. Unlike… Your brother! Ugh! I don’t know what to say to neighbors who ask about him. He joined many demonstrations. And now he embezzles other people’s money… Right? Well, people change… I don’t understand what you’re saying. Just speak Sundanese with me, okay? No English. From Sumedang to Jakarta, you started using slang, and now English Code blue. Code blue. Room 7110. The patient is Krisdayanti. Krisdayanti Who’s this, dork? Sumedang, West Java I’m Kris. Krisdayanti Bye, Mom. Ladies Nurse Thank you Mrs. Vina. You’re welcome. Excuse me Anybody in there? Hey Who are you looking for? Vina So, what did the doctor say? Two more months. More or less. What should I do while waiting for two months? I guess suicide is pointless, right? How do you stay so pretty? This isn’t right. You can still pass as a high school kid. Well, what about you? You’re sick and still beautiful. Hello? Yes, honey? Okay. I’ll be home soon. Bye. My husband… He’s leaving for a business trip in Europe. It’s going to be a long trip. Right, you should go home then. I’ll visit you often. Vina Yes? I really miss them all. Who? The “Free” Gang Can you help find them for me? I want to see them all... before I die. While I’m away, the driver can drive Mia around. So you don’t have to drive her to school. I’ve transferred some money to your account. I still have enough, honey. It’s okay. - Love you. - Bye. Hey buttheads, wait up! Ms. Retno is coming. Good morning, Ms. Retno. Good morning. Where’s Kris? She’s in the restroom, Ma’am. My God, Jessica… Why are you like a breech baby? Please don’t be like her. Jessica, sit up straight! No sleeping. I’m not sleeping, Ma’am. So why is your head down there? Wait, Ma’am. I’m almost finished. My God, Jessica! What happened to your eyebrows? Jessica Give it up, you’ll never be a model. Shut up, twig! I’ll pin you down ‘til you die. That’s enough! We have a new student. Her name is... Vina Panduwinata. Inside my heart What do you find? There is your smile And what else? There is your love Dedi! Baby, please don’t behave like them. Listen, kids. Vina, our new student, comes from Sumedang, West Java. This is her first time in Jakarta. So, be nice to her. Vina, reintroduce yourself. (Sundanese) Hi everyone, (Sundanese) My name is Pina Vina! Vina! What’s up, Miss Pina? Did you bring some Sumedang tofu? Pina! Pina! Did you ride a Pespa motorbike here? Dedi! Vina, sit over there. This seat is taken. Where are you going, Hello Kitty? Please keep in mind. Help out your new friend. You’re a moron. Don’t tease her, understood? Yes, Ma’am. Stay here. Mr. Herman will be here shortly. Hi sweetie. Where do you live? A pretty girl like you, needs protection… from danger. So, where do you live? Don’t be scared, let’s get to know each other. I’m Andra. Shake hands. Hey, shitface. What are you doing here? Beat it! Who’s this, dork? New kid. Where are you from? Sumedang, West Java. Your name? Vina. Vina Panduwinata. Huh? Vina Panduwinata? Your name is exactly like the singer’s name, Vina Panduwinata? Yup. Nice to meet you Vina. We’re in the same boat. I’m Kris. Krisdayanti. That’s right. Also named after the singer. Nice to meet you, too. Calm down, dork. Hey, new kid. Are my left and right eyebrows even? They’re different? Shit! Excuse me Where are you going? You’re so funny. What are you looking at? Meatballs! Meatballs! SCHOOL CAFETERIA Before we eat together, let’s do a duet. Seriously? I didn’t say “duit” (money), I said “duet”. Krisdayanti Vina Panduwinata Duet! - Pardon us, Big Sis. - It’s alright. Hey, over here. Hi, Big Sister. Can I get you anything? Please buy us five bowls of meatballs with lots of chilli sauce on the side and five cold RC Cola. Sure, sure, Sis. Thank you. Oh my God, Jess. Why don’t you cut down some fat instead? (code lingo) What’s that on your forehead? (code lingo) Gecko turds? Hey! I told you, if you want to totally hang out with us girls, know how important looks are. (code lingo) Loser! Hey, close your mouth! Flies can get in. Why a normal girl like you hangs out with these crazy chicks? New student from Sumedang. Vin, meet Jojo. He and Jessica are like oil and water. And Jojo’s dad is actually an oil tycoon. Heavily loaded. “Heavily loaded” means “stinking rich”. Note that. You may wonder why there’s a guy in our girls gang. Jojo was bullied in his freshman year. We pity him, so we adopted him. But now, he’s got an attitude. Shithead! Good thing he’s a great dance teacher, or else... What? What do you want to say? So, you’ve never been to Jakarta? Don’t feel bad. I’ve never been to Sumedang. Don’t be mean. Where’s the Prima Donna? Maybe busy with her Walkman, hiding from all the drooling boys. Must be tiring being pretty. Remember the pretty chick in our class? The one who does this. That’s the Prima Donna, Suci. She’s in our gang, too Hey! Who’s getting the food for my gang? Look there! That one’s pretty normal. She just looks fierce, but she has a gentle heart. Her name’s Gina. Her dad passed away, but her mom... An exemplary lady. A great business woman. She raised Gina all by herself. Here you go! Take mine, I’m not hungry. Thank you, little ones. Now get the hell out of here! - Bye Sis - You can’t have it! So, you’re the new kid? Oh, sorry. Wow, how awesome! What brand is your kicks, mate? Please, Mom. I need new kicks. Kicks? Is that a fruit? Pass me the chili. Shoes, Mom. “Kicks” means shoes. At school, nobody wear my kind of shoes. Many of them wear leather shoes, I forgot what it’s called. You can just ask your, he makes great leather shoes. You got nice ones, remember? Not that kind of leather shoes. I meant leather boots… made in America, Mom. Hey! Do you know how many third world country kids are put into labor… to make those shoes you want? How could she know? Stay out of this! That’s the problem, Mom. She should know! Don’t you all get it? Capitalism is snatching people’s rights, labor rights! Those who fight it, like Marsinah, get killed. And you want American-made shoes. Capitalist! Are you mad? Bringing up capitalism! Talking about killing! We’re hypocrites. Living well while the little folks suffer. Dad, you’re a lackey of the Ministry of Information. But you keep people in the dark. Who’s a lackey? Me? A lackey? Go ahead, leave. Who do you think pays for your college? Who gives you allowance? Or perhaps… you use the money to buy beer? Dear Lord. Money… Marsinah led the fight with no money! Do what you want! But as long as you still get money from me… shut your mouth! Finish college! After that, it’s up to you. You can go crazy all you want, I don’t care! Soon, a revolution will come. Change will happen. And I will take part in it. We’llbring down the corruptors who oppressthis country! Why is he like this? Hey, snatching the food! Snatching food like that! Here, steal my wallet too! (Sundanese) Don’t you blame anyone here! Vina, you don’t age at all. Plastic surgery? Botox? No, Ma’am. You don’t change at all too. Next month my grandchild will be born, Vin. Really? My daughter’s pregnant. - I’m going to be a grandma. - Ma’am. Dian! Yes, Miss? Your eyebrows, did you tattoo them? Dear God. You can go. Excuse me, Miss. Speaking of eyebrows, Jessica dropped by the other day. Are you guys still in touch? Here, her business card. She got herself eyebrow embroidery now. Look. Look at this graph. Really wonderful. Except... Miss Jessica? Yes? You know what I’m about to say, right? Yes, I do. Make more effort. Okay. You’d better make a lot more effort. That eyebrow embroidery costs a fortune, right? And what are those? Fake eyelashes, right? It’s not really fair for you to comment on other people’s appearances. This is what’s unfair! Pick it up. Sorry. Hello, this is Jessica, your trusted insurancepartner. Can I help you? You show up after twenty three years... And you’re telling me you’re dying? That’s cruel! Do you have insurance? Who would’ve thought I’d be an insurance agent? Thanks to my husband who went bankrupt. By the way, your divorce… is your best decision. But whydoesn’t he visit here even once? Well, we have no kids. So, now we act like strangers. Aren’t you lonely? When I was still working, I didn’t feel lonely. But… being ill now… I do feel lonely. Do you know any cool guys? I think I need a hot date before I die. What? I’m serious! I’m sure many of them like rich cougars like me, right? Oh, wow! Hey, I got us some food here. We must find Jojo, Gina, and Suci soon. Yes. Tonight, we’ll Google them. Search for them on Facebook, Instagram… Oh please! I’ve tried all of those. You think I never looked for you guys on the internet? Listen, we have to use a different way. You and I have to make time to look for them, okay? End of story. But I have a husband, and a daughter… For Pete’s sake! Are you stressed? Your husband still wets the bed? You still need to spoon feed your kid? Aren’t you curious about how our friends are doing? Don’t you miss them? Hello? Fine, forget it. I’ll find them myself. Simpler! How do we find them? Remember Dedi from our class? The one who always serenaded you? Inside my heart. Where I keep your face. The memory of your anger. And also your tears. The more I wait, the more I yearn. Inside my heart… There is you! Hey! Go back to work! Yes. Work! So, let me explain, My husband and I had an issue with credit card debt collectors. We ran away and went into hiding. But we were found. By a fat debt collector. None other than this guy, Dedi! So lame. And your debt? Well, debt collectors are human, too. At first I didn’t recognize Jessica. She's not as lovely as you. Hey! Stop being mean! Look at your own shape now. Let’s not talk about those difficult times. Not important. We’ll leave it to Dedi and his guys, and wait for the result. He will find our gang, and we’ll have our reunion. Right, Dedi? I’m on it. Mom, you were too busy to wake me up? I did try to wake you up. Hey! Mia! Pina! Have your breakfast first. Or you’ll quiver from hunger Stop spoiling her, Mom. Knock it off. Eat your breakfast! I’m off! Peace be upon you too! Vin, what are these? (mengajar) Class, I forgot to tell you. Next week, Ms.Retno starts her maternity leave. I will be her substitute until she returns. Have a good weekend, kids! Let’s go! What weapon are you bringing, Jo? You think I still need weapons? Is my tongue not sharp enough? But wait, we need six people to equal their number. We’re one person short! What do we do? Wear this! Why did you bring her along? So we’re not outnumbered. Don’t worry, Vin. We usually never really fight. But, in case we do, just hide behind us. And if any of them follow you home… run. Let’s have a real fight today. I’m so ready! Jessica. do you have any food? Damn it! Just because I’m big, you think I always carry food everywhere? These girls we’re going to face are bullies, They like to rob people’s lunch money. Their gang leader, Lila, was dumped by her boyfriend, who had a crush on Kris. That’s why she hates Kris, And Kris didn’t even like her boyfriend. Shit, they got here first. Relax, they will just try to outcool and insult each other. At worst, there will be hair pulling. Or face-clawing. Hey, Baby Girls! Baby Girls… Your gang’s name’s like a baby powder brand. It’s shitty! Hey, dumbass! Why do you hang out in our turf? Public school girls should stick with public school boys! You’re shameless! Go away! The most suitable place for you all… is the South Pole. go mingle with polar bears! How tragically dumb. you dork! Don’t call me a dork! There are no polar bears in the South Pole. Polar bears live in the North Pole. How spectacularly dumb, let’s give them a big hand. Who’s that? Why did you bring a baby here? You brought a middle school kid to fight us? She looks so scared, like she’s going to pee her pants. Actually, I didn’t want to bring her here. But do you know… what “possession” means? Of course! Sitting, lying down, squatting. That’s “position”, you idiot! I said “possession”, as in possessed by spirits. Where she’s from, a remote West Java area, my friend here is known as... the Barefeet Demonic Virgin. Look! She starts trembling! It means they’re coming. What are you saying? Who’s coming? The demons! You think the city bus? Trust me, don’t look at her eyes. Or else the demons will follow you home. GoJojo! Hey, faggot! Stay out of this! Have you no shame, tagging along with girls? Well, I’m a dude, you’re a dude. So we’re even. At least I’m a real female. I don’t need cheekbone surgery like you. What cheekbone surgery, crazy bitch? Oh, those are real cheekbones? Your faggot tongue's so sharp, it went up your cheeks! Jess! Shut your pie hole! You should wash your trashy mouth! 00:31:40:09 0:31:41:08 It stinks! It’s cleaner than your filthy face! Your hair smells rotten! Your forehead’s big enough to be a car park! Come here you swine! Don’t hold me back! Hana! Let me go! Don’t hold me back! Seriously, stand still or just walk away. Don’t shiver like this, so pathetic. Let me go! Argh! (rambling in Sundanese) Wait a minute! Don’t you blame anyone here! It has no effect... No! No! No! It’s not you who give me food! After seventeen years like this, I should realize, I need to eat! Everyone in the house snores like tractors! How can I sleep? Idiots, all of you! I’ll swallow you whole like a pig! Hey! We have to go! The six o’clock news is starting! But there’s no news at this hour! I’m so hungry. Jo, your choreography starts to wear me out. Did you create those dance moves? I’ll teach you how to dance. I’ll even teach you how to speak like Jakartans. But you have to teach me your “possessed” act. “No! No! No!” Hey! It seems to me... it’s time we induct a new member. We need the Sundanese Demon! Everybody agree to accept Vina as our new member? I agree. I agree. I agree. Whatever. We need a real badass name for our gang. Hey I’m the only one who can swear here. Who invited you? This gang is for girls only. I’m free to do what I want, invited or not. FREE! Come on in, my parents aren’t home. Suci, please stay lovely like this. Once I get into a top university… I will run to you! Top university? As if you can finish high school! Beat it! Now! Do we still have ramen? Find it yourself! Lazy bone! Jaka, Jaka Jaka Hi, Jaka. Would you like some ramen? Sure. No eggs, Jess. Thanks. Hi, Jaka. Hi, everyone. Long time no see. Starting from the eyes, the lovely smile I don’t think I’ve met this one. Vina, our newest member. Cute. Turns out we feel the same way He thinks you’re cute. Oh my God! How lucky are you, Vina? How lucky! I disagree. Nothing cute about her. Good morning, pretty seagull. Man, you sure can draw. Here, another one. Damn it! The internet is so slow! Yes, the phone is locked at night. Your phone is padlocked, dork? Relax. I’ll teach you how to make a call with a locked phone. - You can do that? - Yes. I’m sure each of us can have a handphone soon. Really? Won’t that be expensive? Of course not, Vina. There will be many cheap ones, dork. Hi Hello, Auntie! Want some snacks? Miss Umi’s famous braided cookies! Me first! Thanks, Miss Umi! Bye Mom. Thanks Miss Umi! Gina, hurry! Come listen! Still with Angga here on Prambors Rasisonia, where cool young people hang out. Young Jakartans, I will play a special song for six friends who are too cool for school. Kris, Jessica, Jojo, Gina, Suci and Vina. Gang leader Kris wrote to me… that they have one wish for the future. To be free to live their lives to their hearts’ desire. Awesome! They also want to stay together forever. Turns out, their gang doesn’t have a name yet. I think... the word “free” really define you guys. F-R-E-E. Free! So I name you... the Free Gang!

I can… - No, that’s okay. - That’s alright. Okay. You... don’t age at all, Jo. Are you really Jojo or not? What’s all this pretentious, dignified act? It’s not an act. Hogwash! My darling Jon! Surprise! Oops, sorry, you have guests? Yes, baby. Baby, these are my high school friends. Your high school friends? Hello Baby, I’m Jessica. My name is Ayu, not Baby, Auntie. - Hello - Hi (code lingo) Is she your kid? (code lingo) Or your wife? That’s Russian, right? Your friends are awesome, darling! I want to learn that language!

We’re also trying to find Suci and Gina. Where’s Jessica? She’s busy dealing with a client’s insurance. Gina has two kids now. Remember her mother? Had a stroke after her business went bankrupt. She got scammed. And Gina’s husband? Gina’s husband left her two years ago, for a younger woman. They’re not the same anymore, Vin. Jo... Yesterday after I saw you and Jessica, that felt like… Like you’re alive again? Absolutely. Right? Hey, Jo By the way, your “baby”, Ayu Are you serious with her? Poor girl. What will you do with her? I’ve been married before, Vin, only lasted for a year. I’m trying again now with Ayu. I’m still the same old me. I still can’t defy my Dad, I have to continue the family business, live normally.

Latest news! A doctor is arrested for insulting the President. Hey, Man. Hey Thank you! Hey, Man! - Hey Jaka - What’s up? You’re Jessica’s new friend, right? What’s your name? Vina. Vina Panduwinata. Vina Panduwinata? Like the singer? Yes. You have a fever? Your face is red like you’re about to burst. Where are you going? Restroom, to wash my hands. LADIES RESTROOM Hey! How dare you come here! This club is our turf. Did you think first before coming here? Who the hell are you? You got some nerves. You talk like a Jakartan now, huh? I know all about you. You’re a Sumedang tofu kid, right? You pretended to be possessed, tricking me. Screw you! I heard your gang has a name now. The “Free” Gang. Yikes! What a dumb name! You asked a radio host to name your gang? Super lame! Hey! Duit (money) Duet? Sing together? Money! I need money to get my hair done! I don’t wanna sing! I have no money. Shit! Fucking bitch! Hold her down! What’s the matter with you?! You don’t know who you’re dealing with. You think some prince will come and rescue you... Hey Shit! What a cliché this is. Can you just… come back later when I’m done with this chick? You… You’re from Kandita High School, right? Yeah, so? Did you hear... about a girl from Kandita High named Rachma? She has a 20-centimeter scar on her mouth? I did that to her. She had the nerves to bully my little sister. I really hate bullies. Girl or guy, all the same to me. I’ll will ruin their face. Bullshit! You think so? Come here! I’m so high right now, but I won’t miss. I promise I will slowly cut you. Oh shit! MTV Asia is starting, right? Let’s go, let’s go! Lucky you! Nadya Hutagalung, the MTV VJ is more important than you! Thank you. Are you okay? I’m alright. Chicks nowadays, scary as hell. Let's go. Good evening. Good evening. He’s not a real fried rice seller. What do you mean? He’s a government agent. Our government is restless. Some places where youngsters hang out are under surveillance. Those who speak up are silenced. That’s why Tempo magazine, Detik Tabloid… were shut down. Are you an activist? Nope. I consider myself… a music lover. Who is also pro-peace and anti-violence. No use being an activist or someone in power… if you can’t appreciate music. That kind of people can only control people with violence. I like music, too. I love old music. To me, music from the past is more creative. My name is Jaka. JakaPradana. There’s gum stuck in your hair. Those girls must’ve done it. Ouch! Use acetone to get it off. Or get a haircut. You’re having another fever? No. We’re here. That’s my house. That one. By the way... If you bump into them again, just tell them I’m your boyfriend. A recent brawltaking place on Monday, at three was… Why are we at a gang war zone? They dared us to come here. Maybe the Baby Girls set us up. Was I wrong to fight back? Of course not! Listen, guys. Just because we are the 'Free' gang… doesn’t mean anyone is free to mess with us. If they mess with us, they won’t walk away free! Where’s our princess? She’s meeting her manager and that famous photographer. Getting ready to be a cover girl. It’s nice being pretty. I think I can be a model too. Nope! There they are! Hey, monkeys! How dare you challenge us! Your little friend is a coward. She got a guy to fight her battle. Shut up! It’s not my fault a guy doesn’t like you back, dork! Hey, faggot! Coward! What’s a grade school kid doing here? Shopping with the big girls? Go home, kid! Hands off, I’ll get your midget virus! Shut the fuck up! I'll get you! Don’t join those mass organizations. Where are you going? Don’t join all those demonstrations. Just focus on your study! Where are you going? Please pray for our movement to succeed. Just go inside, Mom. I will come home when the fight is done. What fight? Yongki! Take care of Mom and Dad while I’m gone. Page me if you need anything. Where are you going? Mia, I’m picking you up, not the driver. There’s too many cars. I might not be able to enter. So I’ll wait out front. Let me know when you get out. I keep calling and you don’t pick up. Leave me alone! Mia! Hey! Mia... You can’t run now Okay, relax, just relax. I don’t need to see your phone. It’s done. But… Be on the watch. Kiss me first. Kiss me. Hey! What do you think you are doing?! Stay out of this, Lady! You want to be fondled too? Get back here! Hey! Sweetheart, are you okay? What have they done to you all this time? Why didn’t you ever tell me? I told the teachers but they don’t believe me! So what’s the use of telling you? What can you do? Fight them? I can... Do you even have the guts? When do you ever have the guts? About Gina… Why did Gina give me this much money? She’s the one who needs money, not me. I just want to see her. She promised to call you, darling, she promised. Right, Vin? Vin What’s up with you? You’ve been so quiet. Nothing. I’m concentrating. I haven’t sketched for a while. Vina, Jo Is there anything you still want to do so much… but can’t? Or something you’ve wanted to work on… but haven’t had the chance. Hold on. That is a complicated question. Right now I’m just living my life. I’m going through day by day. But… If I follow my heart, that’s asking for trouble. Don’t look at it that way, Jo. You have to make your life meaningful. Life’s too short. It’s not easy being me. Trust me! And you, Vin? I always accept things, right? I never like confrontations. But this time, I really feel I need to do something. I’m so mad right now! Why? What’s going on? Why are you mad? Who messed with you? Yes, who is it? Just because we are the “Free” gang, doesn’t mean anyone is free to mess with us. And if they mess with us, they won’t walk away free. Yes! There they are! Nice! I’m gonna have fun. Just because I’m sick… you think I can’t kick ass? Hey, monkeys! Cowardly rascals! Stop picking on girls! Come here! Take that! Take that! For this case, we’ll summon your parents and school principal. Sir, don’t involve our parents. Top-notch designer handbag! The price is right! Did you see Kris’ bag make a serious dent on that kid’s forehead? But did you see how Vina beat him up? - Scary! - Menacing Anybody else needs revenge? While we’re still on fire! This uniform, though. So comfortable! Ladies, gentleman, you think this is a picnic? This is serious. We’re going to the police station. We have to make flyers, you know? What flyer? The “Free” Gang - Justice League. Don’t forget the tag line. You pay cash, we gladly bash! Please be quiet! Sir… What now? You know my friends here are quite insane. So to calm them, can you turn the music up? You are so bad, dork. Vina Panduwinata. You sure you can dance with us at the school festival? Sorry, I’m so bad, aren’t I? If you realize it, then leave the group. We’re better off without this idiot. Suci, You are so mean. What’s with you, dork? The “Free” gang or whatever it’s called. I can no longer be part of this. Too pathetic. Hey. What? I don’t know why you hate me so much. But I can’t let you just leave us like that. Us? Yeah, us! How dare you. Since when you and I are “us”? I just want to know why you hate me. No reason. I just hate you. Now leave. You can’t just leave us. Let go. Oh, hi. We have a guest? Come inside. Good evening, Auntie. (Sundanese) Sorry to disturb you. Good evening. No, you’re not disturbing. You’re a Sundanese too? Where from? Sumedang, Auntie. Go inside, stay out of this! Suci, you never told me you have a new friend from Sumedang. (Sundanese) Have dinner with us? Come in. (Sundanese) Thank you so much, Auntie. I’m good. Go inside! Invite your friend in, let Mommy prepare it. You are not my mom! Wait, Vin. Suci... Come on! It’s so unfair, you hate me... because your stepmom is from Sumedang too. This kind of ethnicism inhibits democracy. Can you speak like a normal person? Don’t be a smartass. Can you just be normally pretty? And not look like a supermodel? I was born beautiful. What can I do? I was born smart. What can I do? Suci has done a clever vanishing act. We still can’t trace her whereabouts. I’ll keep trying. By the way, Dedi... can you help me find someone else? But I only have his full name and a sketch when he was young. Now I see why you came here alone. So late at night too! Cut it out! This one is easy to find! Stop it, Dedi! Woo-hoo, Vin, didn’t see this coming! Quick! Help them! Nurse! Nurse! Get her doctor here! Kris. Thank you. For what? You made me realize... I’m more than just someone’s wife, or someone’s mother. I forgot to be myself. And you… reminded me… I’m also the main character. At least, in my own life story. You certainly look like a main character, dork. Suci, even more so. I’ll keep trying to find her for you. What’s this? All the main characters. (HUSBAND calling) Vina Panduwinata, steady with the camera. Stop shaking, okay? Okay, I’ll go first. Kris, you will be an amazing woman. You’ll always fight for women’s rights. You won’t let men walk all over you. So, you’ll always have to… Jessica, you’ve finally become a beautiful and successful woman. Well done, Jessica! You’ve become an incredible plastic surgeon! Jojo, Indonesia’s renowned choreographer! You’re globally famous because you also train… Madonna! Hi Gina, You’ll become a top businesswoman like your mother. Even your children will admire you. You’re not only rich, you will be a woman who always help underprivileged children. A Nobel prize for you, Gina! Hey Cover Girl, Strike a sexy pose! Come on! Suci. Vina, you graduated from the world’s best art school. Your paintings are world famous. And you’re enjoying life by travelling around the world! - I stand here. - I stand here, okay? Are we even in the frame? GIRL’S RESTROOM Hey, sweetie. What do you want? Why so feisty? Admit it, you like it. Me here coming to you. And I heard... Chicks from where you come from, like to be touched like this. Get your hands off me! Whoa, scary chick. I want to make a suggestion. Stop hanging out with those friends of yours. Suci, Kris... They’re dangerous. They’re lesbians. Leave me alone or I’ll scream! Calm down! Relax. There’s no use screaming. Wow, this looks really messy. Get up. Get up! All girls are disgusted by you. Your mouth reeks of cheap alcohol and you’re a coward! Everybody knows, Kris beat you up for harassing me. If I were you, I’d be ashamed to still come here. The next time I catch you harassing girls in this school, I will finish you off. Understood? Yes. Are you okay? Eww, what’s with the bathroom hug fest? I want in. Suci, thank you for coming on this trip... for my birthday. Hey! She came along because of me. Don’t flatter yourself. What are you drawing? It’s nothing. Come sit with us. Hello. Dad, I’m going now. Don’t stay out too late. I think this lady needs help. I’m going with him. Jaka, finally I can give this to you. Hey, look! The power of being a cover girl. I can’t imagine if you’re a TV star too. Give a big hand for the grade 11 science class, collaborating with the grade 11 social studies! What’s wrong with you lately? Nothing. Grab a bite. There’s still time. Next up is a performance from… Duo Elecronica And Lemon Lime, Ma’am. Okay, just take it. Hey, sweetie. Lately I’ve been thinking about you a lot. Because I feel sorry for you. All this time, I should’ve been nicer to you. Let’s eat this bread together. Let’s eat it together. To celebrate… our close relationship. What do you want? I just want us to be close. I said I don’t want to. Hey! Just try it this once. Trust me. It’s safe. Kris! What? It’s Vina. You have to trust me! Hey! Haven’t you learned your lesson? Krisdayanti, starting today, I want to join the “Free” gang. Should I… become a faggot first, like Jojo to be accepted by you? Move forward! Move, Krisdayanti! Move! I just want to get close to you all! Why don’t you… want to be my girl? Help! Suci! Get an ambulance! Dedi, get an ambulance! Mr. Herman, help! I have bad news. Suci tried to commit suicide. Her wound is so deep, her face… I’ve spoken to your parents. We all agreed. It would be best if… you all leave this school. You all must go separate ways. You only bring bad influence to one another, if together. I’m sure this is just temporary separation. We will all be fine. Dad. Hey, you’re picking me up? We miss you. Where’s our driver? Mom’s driving, Dad. Really? That’s cool Hey! Buddy, ride carefully! Don’t endanger us! What? Mom, it’s Auntie Jessica Hello, yes Jess? No one came. This is what it’s like when you have no family. Maybe my house would look like this when I die. Empty. Don’t be silly, Jo. Your life is way from over. What are you talking about? Does anyone know… why Kris made us gather here tonight? From now on… when you get together, don’t forget me! Gina... How did you make it here? Miss Umi is looking after the kids and your Mom? Yes. I can’t miss this one. Jessica, how are you? You haven’t changed. Gina, I missed you so much! You were right, Vina. I should’ve come then. So, only Suci who’s not here yet? How is she? We couldn’t find her. We actually put an ad in the paper. Look. KRISDAYANTI’S FAREWELL WITH THE “FREE” GANG SUCI, YOU MUST COME, DORK! But I don’t think she’s coming. Let’s just pray for Kris now, shall we? Okay Are you a friend of Kris’s? I’m Ms. Krisdayanti’s notary. Are you members of the “Free” Gang? - That’s right! - Yes. Sit, sit down. I was appointed by the late Ms. Krisdayanti, to execute her will. Hey, dorks! Pardon me, I’m only reading her will exactly as written, as Ms. Krisdayanti requested. No word can be skipped. I will continue. This is what’s written, “Hey dorks!” “I am sorry, I have to go first. Vina, thank you. For getting us back together. The “Free” Gang. Although I didn’t live long… at least I got to be the main character… in my own life story. You made me realize that. I’m deeply grateful to you. I hand over the “Free” Gang leadership to you. From now on, make sure you meet often. Don’t waste your lives. Vin, see you again.” Oh my God! Congratulations! Vina Panduwinata! Our new leader. Jessica? Yes? You work at an insurance company? Yes. Everybody here… will buy insurance from you. All costs will be paid in advance, in full. What does it mean? How? She left a large amount of money for that. And she also wrote… “You’re this month’s Insurance Queen, dork.” Yay! I’m the queen? Jojo. “My darling Jonathan.” That’s me. For you she wrote… “You can be our gang’s vice president.” Oh, vice president! But I was already the vice president then. No, it was me! - No! Hey! - Cool it, guys. Are you disappointed? Well, not really... If you’re disappointed… she asked me to read the following sentence. Okay, I’m disappointed. Read on. “I don’t need to give you anything, because you’re already rich, bicth!” What the…? She added, “But I’ll pray that… you will find your true love.” Gina? Yes? Me? She left you with… an apartment unit for you and your children. The funds for your children’s school tuitions until graduation… have been set aside. And she has prepared a job for you, in one of her publishing companies. Additionally, she has also reserved… a place at the best hospital… for your mother’s rehabilitation. Kris, thank you. But, she has one final wish. You’ve all received the dance video? The DVD. Yes, I have. Get up. Are you ready? Oh, the video is for this! Yes, play it. Hey y’all Don’t go anywhere Clap your hands together now. Let’s sing and dance together! Oh yeah!
