Chemical reflex. Often happens. She has returned. Just like she promised. I don't want to appear melodramatic, but what you are about to see is rather, how shall I say? Your aunt, Mrs. boyle, died in unusual circumstances. You didn't mention any of this in your letter. No, I didn't. I thought it's best not to mention it at that state. I didn't want to alarm you unduly. You were going to learn the full facts in the curse anyway. I don't follow you. Your aunt suffered a mental breakdown, and well, the point is, she committed suicide in front of her video camera. This tape is her last will and testimony after function. Thank you. Hello, Helen. You can't imagine the aching I feel in my bones. It hurts so that I can scarcely bear it. And yet I know that as you're watching these pictures, you're sitting there with your sweet husband, impatiently waiting you're inheritance. Do you realize that it's been 20 years since the last time we met? As a child, you were the spitting image of your mother. The sister I hated. You should have been my daughter, you know, but your mother tried to steal away the only man I ever loved, but she failed. You know, I've never forgotten you, Helen. And so I'm, bequeathing you all my fortune. You're going to inherit all my worldly possessions. Strychnine after I drink this, you're going to be richer than you ever imagined. Ta-ta. We should have been there by now. I still can't believe what's happening to us. Yesterday, we're living in a studio in Van nuys, we've got what, $2,000 in our savings account with me working 10 hours a day, and today, we're millionaires. But don't you think it's odd the lawyer didn't wanna come with us? Ah, what do we need him for? First, I think we should buy a condo in the Marina, then a yacht. Bob, I doubt we'll have that much money. What are you talking about? Your aunt said you'd have more money than you'd ever dream of. I mean, the lawyer said she was incredibly rich. Yep, I'll never have to teach tennis again, that's for sure. Let's stop at the next town and check these directions. All right. Excuse me, hi. Sorry to bother you. We're looking for a place called eight manors. You must be Mrs. boyle's niece. Yes I am. How did you know? We were expecting you? Great! Follow us. Thank you. Come on Jack. Thank you. Hi. Can I help you? Could you tell me where a Mrs. Catherine boyles house is? She has no house, she's dead. You're Helen Hewitt, aren't you? That's right. I'd of recognized you anywhere. Do you know why? Because I see your face every day, year after year. What do you mean? The photograph of your mother. I see it every time I have to dust. You're identical, the same eyes, same smile. Well, maybe. Mrs. boyle spoke of you frequently. Right Louis? Well, she did. She remembered her sister every day. She often spoke out loud to her. When she decided to die, she told us you'd soon be arriving, but she never mentioned any gentleman. He's my husband. How tall and handsome he is. Well, I'll just be getting the bags. Louis help the gentleman with the baggage. Louis, remember Mrs. Boyle's instructions. We must be courteous to her niece. You can't leave your car on the street. I'll move it. Thanks. See you inside. J I've seen the future j j I can't afford it & I can't believe all those expensive cars in the garage. What do you think she used them for? Who knows. I'll bet there'll be a lot more surprises though. Well, didn't you tell me that your aunt was locked up in a nuthouse once or something? Yeah, but that was before I was born. Why was she committed? I really don't know. My mother didn't like to talk about aunt Catherine. It's as if something bothered her. Then one day she confessed that she was afraid of her. Even as a child. She used to take her toys and break them. Evidently she was a violent child. Just like you, huh? How dare you call me violent. Very violent. Repeat that. Go on. What? Very, very violent? Very, very violent. You dominate me. You make me my suffer. My mission in life, cause hours and hours suffering. More, more, more. Ah, the tubs running over. Remind me of this conversation tonight. Why not now? Bob, we're new here, remember? Tonight. Tonight. Please? Tonight. Tonight. Oh well. I can't wait. Wait a minute. I know I put my stuff over here. Nah. Bob! Bob! Bob! Helen, what is it? Helen, answer me! What's wrong? Help me! Bob! What the hell? What happened, hm? What happened? Oh! Helen, talk to me! What happened? It's okay. Speak to me, what happened? Come on. I saw her! Who did you see? Aunt Catherine! What the hell are you talking! Your aunt Catherine is dead! She tried to kill me! Honey, she's dead! Listen to me, your aunt is dead! No! She tried to kill me, Bob! Helen, the curtain fell down, that's all! No! The curtain suffocated me! Okay, okay, okay, it's all right. It's okay, it's okay. It's all right. All right, here we go. Here, put your. That's it, it's okay, relax, I'm here. Bob, it was terrible. Honey, the shower curtain just came loose, that's all. No, everything started vibrating, and then I saw her. She smiled at me. Oh Helen, how can you believe that? At the crematorium she moved. Well, they explained that. Something about the gases. I mean, it happens. I'm afraid. Look, this house is great. It's got two swimming pools. The other ones are probably just like it. Your aunt left all of this to you. Why would she wanna hurt you? Her expression was so sinister, and then she smiled. Maybe you fell asleep in the tub, huh? Look I tell you what we're gonna do. You just close your eyes for a couple of hours and get some rest. And then, we're gonna get all dressed up and go look at our estate. Just like a couple of real millionaires, okay. That's it. There's the smile. I love you. In the garage alone there must be at least $300,000! And all the houses and the land. What do you think they're worth? I bet it's worth a lot more than we thought. Amazing how much you look like her. I barely remember her. I was very young when she died. It's no wonder you never learned how to cook. It's been a long day and we're probably both hungry. Then let's go find the maid. Oh look. It's a nice big kitchen. Beautiful, beautiful. But first, let's see what they've got. Nothing. An ant could starve in here. I was just looking for you. I thought you might be hungry. - Yes. - Starving is more like it. My name is Bob. I'm Lisa and this is Louis. Are all the neighbors American? Not everybody. Stuart Whitmore is British. He's our writer, a bit of a celebrity in his day. Book of the month club and all that. Reverend Flaherty's such a pain. He makes us sing hymns every day. But when he preaches, I could listen to him all day. Irish of course. David hume is from Los Angeles. Some people say he's mad, but he's not. He's quite brilliant. And like a lot of blind people, he seems to have a special gift, a sixth sense. Gertrude and Jack, of course you've already met. Jack's a bit simple, but she knows how to take care of him. And then there's Dr. Anderson, why he takes care of all of us. We have a very special relationship with Dr. Anderson. Oh yes and then there's Louis. He's not as fierce as he looks. My dear friends, this is the first time that we meet since the untimely departure of our kind benefactress, Catherine boyle. She decided to leave our company, but her unexpected absence puts us all in an extremely difficult situation. Dr. Anderson has more to say about this. Thank you reverend Flaherty. Until Mrs. boyles' wishes are fulfilled, we must proceed with the utmost care. Let's not forget, we will be homeless if we're not allowed to stay here. Mrs. boyle would never let that happen. I'm afraid it could Mrs. klein. Catherine's niece and her husband have arrived. We can't afford to take unnecessary risks. That's why I suggest we cancel tonight's concert. Oh. Well maybe we can still have the concert, but we'll have to change the ending. Who wants to have a concert under those conditions? Yes, Dr. Anderson, you've always insisted that that type of therapy was essential for us. Well, that's true, but what- Mrs. boyle agreed and personally hired the quartet for us. Jack's getting nervous. If we don't have the concert tonight, I can't be responsible for his actions. All right. We should pay a visit now to Catherine's niece. Reverend Flaherty and Mr. Whitmore will accompany me. We're so glad to have you here as our new neighbors. Now that your aunt has passed away, there are six of us occupying eight chalets. There's only six of you and us. Who occupies the vacant house across the street? No one really. It's just not being rented at this time. Your aunt was very fond of that particular house. I've been going over some of these papers up. There's something you can help me out with. Perhaps we can. I see that there's a lot of bills that we need to pay, but I don't show any rent being paid by anyone. Rent? But we've never had to pay any rent here. We were sure the lawyer would have told you that. No, he didn't. We are guests here. So you pay no rent? That's right. Catherine was a very generous woman. And there are no bank statements here. Where did she keep her money? Mrs. boyle, never trusted banks. Her failing health kept her from leaving the premises. She kept all her money somewhere in eight manors. Where? We don't know where. So much money hidden away. Well, we've got to be going now. We have a concert to attend. What the hell? I am losing my mind. Whoa boy. Bob? Bob? Hello? Hello! Who is this? Bob? Are you in there? Bob? Bob? Bob! (Door bangi ngin Bob! 9 Oh magnificent! Absolutely magnificent! - Lovely. - Thank you very much. Thank you. That's a very difficult piece to play- - but you performed it exquisitely. - Marvelous, marvelous. - Thank you. Thank you, you are very kind. Don't you think that was a wonderful interpretation, Mr. hume? Of course. Mr. hume is a music expert, who was once a performer. That was a long time ago. Thank you for a splendid evening. Unforgettable! Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me, but it's late and we have another engagement. Who will pay us our fee? Ah, your fee. They wish to be paid. Of course they should be paid. Don't worry. You'll be taken care of. Mrs. boyle hired you, we'd have to take you to her. Mrs. boyle is expected any minute. We can take you to her now, if you wish. Of course we can. Don't pay any attention to them. Mrs. boyle has not returned yet. One of us will pay you. Of course. We're a quiet law abiding community who believe in our divine creator. Are you believers? Of course. Good. Faith is the path to salvation. Bob! Bob! Jack. Jack! You idiot! What's wrong with my cane? Dr. Anderson, do you think you could teach Jack some manners? All right everybody, let's clean up. You all know what to do. Don't worry, doctor. No one has seen us. Helen! Oh my god, what happened? Lovely music. Music's the highest form of art. I almost died of carbon monoxide poisoning, car lights switch on and off, engines start by themselves! And I swear that was my aunt I saw behind the wheel that of that Bugatti. Oh come on Helen, try to be realistic. Damnit Bob, it was her! All right, all right. But how can we leave with all this money just lying around? And where were you last night? Looking for it? Now try to be calm, okay. I'm sorry, but how can I be calm after last night? I found a trap door in the kitchen. It led to this really strange cellar. Yeah. Well, last night I went down there. Well, if you didn't find the money, don't bother to tell me about it. All I found were piles of rotten food. Yeah, so what does that mean? 1 don't know, I guess they never eat. Oh, you see, normal, like everything else around here. Come on, Helen. Can't you see that they're just trying to scare us away from the money? Well, they've succeeded. Now we're packed, let's go. How can we just walk away from all of this? We were happy before all of this. Well, that was before all this. Things are different now. Don't you care about what happened to me last night? Of course I care. All right. You can leave, but I'm staying until I find the money. I remember once at wimbledon, I almost lost the match in the third set, when the odds were really against me, but I didn't give up. I can't give up. Okay honey, if you stay, I stay. I don't care! I want you to come immediately! I want you to evict these people! And I also demand to know where my aunt kept her money! I don't know where her money is. Well, you should. The important thing is that they leave immediately. I'll be there tonight. I don't think I can stand one more night in this place. Sure you can honey. Hey, come here, look at me. Just relax, all right. Everything's gonna be fine. It's okay. Good morning. Well, good morning. I don't see what's so good about it. I fixed you a nice breakfast. Louis cut these roses especially for you. Beautiful, thank you. Listen, Lisa, tell me. The abandoned house across the street. Yes. Who has the keys? I've never heard anything about any keys. You have no idea? No. Alright, thank you. Bob, look at this. Stuart Whitmore, I knew I heard his name before. He was a mediocre novelist. Was? 1924 to 1982. According to this, he died six years ago. That's absurd. Well, you wanna see for yourself? He committed suicide while a patient at a clinicin Devonshire, Pennsylvania. That was the nut house that aunt Catherine was locked up in! David hume, 1930 to 1980. Gertrude Stein, 1934 to 1982. Jack ritchy, 1942 to 1981. Reverend Flaherty, 1925 to 1979. They all committed suicide while they were at that asylum. What about Dr. Anderson? He was the director of the psychiatric ward, and he committed suicide too. This has gotta be some kind of plan. I'm telling you, they are just trying to scare us off. Look, I'll tell you what, I'll go and talk to them and I'll see what I can find out. Okay? I don't wanna stay here by myself. Just lock yourself in the bedroom, all right. You'll be fine, I promise you. I love you. Bob? What? What did happen when you were three sets behind at wimbledon? I lost. You must forgive Louis, he has dreadful manners. Is he your husband? That bastard? No, I need something better than that. We've been to bed a couple of times, but only 'cause it's so lonely around here. And you can't be too choosy, can you? I guess not. We're going to reverend Flaherty's sermon. We sing hymns and he talks to us about eternity and things like that. Do you believe in eternity? Well, I do. I'm sure of it. The abandoned house. I mean, did Catherine actually live in that house? Well, she went in there every night. I didn't know what she did there. Well, there must be some keys around somewhere, right? Maybe. I'd like to do it with you. What? Go to bed, naturally. You can ask me whenever you want. Well, okay. But I think I'll have to check it out with my wife first. I really would like to find those keys though. Look for them. But if you find them- what? I wouldn't go in there if I were you. That's my advice. J mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord j j he's trampling out the vintage j j where the grapes of wrath are stored j j he hath loosed the fateful lightning of I j his terrible swift sword j j his truth is marching on j j glory, glory, hallelujah j J glory, glory, hallelujah j J his truth is marching on j j glory, glory, hallelujah j j glory, glory, hallelujah j j glory, glory, hallelujah j j his truth is marching on j j mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord j j he is trampling out the vintage j j where the grapes of wrath are stored j j he hath loosed the fateful lightning of I j his terrible swift sword j j his truth is marching on j As you know, Mrs. boyle will soon be in our midst. And by that time we should have carried out her instructions regarding Helen. We cannot allow them to evict us or tolerate more strangers here. Mrs. boyle wants to share this place with only us. And if Mrs. boyle doesn't return? There is no difference between Mrs. boyle and us. Remember, we also went through a gradual period of adjustments. She'll return. Welcome Mr. Hewitt. Welcome to our little sanctuary. I'd like to talk to you. All of you. I found this. I assume it doesn't belong to any of you. What are you implying Mr. Hewitt? There are just two things that I'd like to know. First, why are you trying to scare us off? Scare you? I'm surprised at you Mr. Hewitt. Why should we do that? On the contrary, we hope you will never forget your stay here with us. There are just too many strange things going on around here. What do you mean? Mr. Hewitt, we're a peace loving group who've chosen to live our lives apart from the outside world. Does any of us look as if he wants to frighten anyone? What can we do to put your mind at ease? I tried to be friendly, but he wasn't interested. Get this straight, everybody. No matter what you do, we are not leaving until we get what we came for. We hope that you'll remain with us to eternity. Mrs. boyle said you probably would. Isn't that right doctor? Or at least that your very attractive wife would. What else would you like to ask us? It's about Mrs. Boyle's money, isn't it? Exactly. It's only fair you should be informed. Very fair. The money does exist my son. Eight million dollars. Eight million! There's a sparkle in your eye. Mr. Hewitt. Greed is it? Well, let me assure you, we're not interested in that money. But we know where it is. Well where? Greed, Mr. Hewitt, greed. Don't worry, the money belongs to you. No one will take it. Who is it? Open up, it's me. I was starting to get scared. What took you so long? Honey, you're trembling. Everything's gonna be all right sweetheart. Please Bob, let's go home. I was just talking to them. But they don't really exist! They're the living dead! Do you realize that your aunt left you eight million dollars? And they're gonna show me where it is! I don't care about the money! I just wanna go home! Honey, we can't leave now, the lawyer's on his way. And besides I made a deal with them. What kind of deal? It's simple really. I mean, they're gonna show me where the money is, if we let them stay here. We won't get out of here alive. Look honey, you've got to be strong. Please, I promise you, I will never leave you alone again. Each of us would like to carry out this simple task, I'm sure. But we must be fair. Mr. ritchy is automatically excluded. Huh? Why? He's gone much too far lately. It would be unnecessarily cruel. I'll kill the lawyer. He's not exactly my type, but at least he's a man. Can't you forget about your filthy habits, even at a time like this? Just because you hate men it doesn't mean I have to! Now please, please, we mustn't quarrel. Mrs. boyle would not approve. I believe that she should be the one to decide. You see Mr. ritchy, Mrs. boyles is also angry with you. Helen. Helen. Helen. Helen. Helen. Helen. Helen. No! No! Thank god, we're here to help you now my child. Give me your hand, I'll pull you out! It's useless Mrs. Hewitt. Help! Please come out, we won't hurt you! Bob, help! Mrs. Hewitt, you tried to evict us from here! And we're just a gentle, peace-loving group! Eight manors belongs to us! It's the only place we can possibly live! Sooner or later you'll have to come out of there! Or Jack will come in to get you. Bob! Bob! ; Run! - Helen, come closer! - Bob! - I've got you! - No! - Give me your hand! - Bob, watch out! They're behind you! No. Please, don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him! Not him! I'll do whatever you want! Everything's going to be all right, Mrs. Hewitt. We only want to help you. Mrs. boyle wants you to be like us, but you must stop resisting us. You must trust me Mrs. Hewitt. Helen. Helen. Soon I will be with you again, Helen, and you with us, forever. You must obey the doctor, Helen. Death is nothing if you seek it out. It is nothing, Helen. Nothing. Helen. Helen. Come in Mrs. Hewitt, please come in. You should have stayed in bed. I see you're going to be a difficult and disobedient patient. I'm not sick! Of course you are. All living creatures are. That's why they wither and die. Where's my husband? Don't you remember? We had to kill him last night. No. But you saw what happened? Oh no. My god. But why? We were merely following your aunt's instructions. My aunt is dead! They gave me her ashes! And what does that matter? The mind can transcend death. We only utilize 5% of our mental capacity. With the help of modern chemistry, once the material is left behind- - chaos ceases and order reigns over the universe. You can attain the highest form. Stuart Whitmore. The newspapers said that you were a patient in a mental institution! You killed yourself. Of course, we all committed suicide at the Devonshire. And you too must participate in Dr. Anderson's therapy my dear. I was an ordinary psychiatrist when your aunt was committed. You know the case history, two sisters in love with the same man. What does that have to do with all of you? Your aunt's mind could never recuperate from being abandoned. She sponsored my research and purchased the Devonshire clinic so that I have a place to experiment. I conducted about a dozen tests unsuccessfully, till the reverend Flaherty became my first triumph. And I shall always be grateful to you doctor. Your aunt constructed eight manors for us. And no one will ever throw us out! Catherine decorated this house as if she were going to live here with her beloved. When your father died right after you were born, she brought him here to be with her. He used to come every night to read his favorite books and listen to his beloved music. No. Bob! Perfect Mr. Hewitt. I'm certain this drastic shock has destroyed your wife's defense's. Conscience bothering you, Mr. Hewitt? Guilt is only a state of mind, Mr. Hewitt. Forget about it. You promised me you wouldn't harm her. We won't. I've lived up to my end of the bargain. Eight million dollars should help you get over your worries. And where is the money? In due time Mr. Hewitt. I want my money now. I don't like to be threatened, Mr. Hewitt. You'll get it in due time. You're very greedy, aren't you? I used to be like that. We'll give you the money after your wife commits suicide. Suicide? There's nothing to worry about, Mr. Hewitt. Suicide's a voluntary act, she'll understand. She'll do it happily. You helped us immeasurably. Her treatment has been advanced now by at least a month. Your wife had one of the most resistant minds I've ever encountered. Look, you crazy son of a bitch, if anything happens to my wife- - and what will you do, Mr. Hewitt? You'll get the money tomorrow, and we hope you'll be able to enjoy it for as long as you live. Ah. As azrael said to the lord, "life must be destroyed in order to be recreated." The burning bush burns so that fresh flowers may bloom, and death purifies all so that life may be reborn from it. Mrs. boyle will soon be reincarnated, we've carried out her orders, and her niece is here before us ready to embark on that difficult journey to eternal peace. Now my child, are you ready? Yes. Are you sad to be leaving this ephemeral and absurd reality behind? No. Do you firmly believe in your physical reintegration through the grace of your mind's physical power? Yes, I believe. Then Helen Hewitt, destroy all the superfluous within you and accept your new life free from care and suffering. Helen! Do it! Do it now! Do it I tell ya! Are you all right? I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Forgive me. Oh what happened? Was it all a nightmare? It doesn't matter honey, it's over. It's all over now. What about Dr. Anderson? As long as he's alive, oh, we're not safe. Don't worry. Bob, no! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob, Bob! Bob? Bob? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard flight ib767. Our flying time will be approximately six hours. We will be flying at an altitude of 30,000 feet and a cruising speed of 600 miles per hour. Smoking is permitted in rows. Excuse me, could you give me the correct time? Can I help you my child?
