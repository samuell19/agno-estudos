Society page Marriage proposal This afternoon a great party will be held in the halls of our distinguished friend do?a Juanita Izquierdo, to announce the upcoming marriage of her beautiful niece Rosita with the well-known industrialist of this town, Don Serafin Gonz?lez. This cup doesn't correspond with the saucer. There are 24 cups with flowers and only 22 dishes. You could have said, we'll have to buy two saucers. Or break two cups. Come with me. I'll go down and everything will be half done. If I was your age... Let's see flowers at the entrance. Very nice. Very nice. Bautista has shone. Roses. - Always the name of the bride. - And intertwined with orange blossom. It's like a "jeglorif". - "Jeglo" what? No, a riddle. It doesn't seem the same, Ma'am. Still not set a wedding date. And here we must put an ashtray. I'll bring one from the parlour. - From wherever. And bring the roses. I'll go check on Rosita. She's probably not even dressed yet. Rosita, girl, Where are you? Rosita! Are you asking about Miss? - Yes, have you seen her? I've just come from the ironing board. - Well? She wasn't there. - You've starch in your blood. Rosita, girl! Have you seen Rosita around? - No, ma'am. Child, go to the kitchen and you'll be able to make a dessert. Send Clarita to number five. Maybe she's chatting there without looking at the clock. I don't know if it's a weakness to grant you these moments. But I was reluctant that it should end this way forever. Doesn't that word give you the shivers? "Forever". It has to be. - Rosita? Go, Jos?, go. Rosita! Hey, you! You, what are you doing here? What are you stealing? - Stealing? No, ma'am, I was looking at the garden and dropped my hat inside. Have you seen my hat? I've seen you trying to jump the fence. It's enough to call the Civil Guard. That's not fair. - It's I who must speak of fairness. It's not with impunity one enters a strange house. Rosita! Were you by any chance...? - This young man was talking to me. He was saying goodbye at the moment you arrived. Not stealing. At least he's not come to steal something of little value. You now, out! - Yes, ma'am, right now. By the door where decent people leave. I'll do you the honour of offering that for your exit. Yes, ma'am, you're quite right. At your service. Thank you. What is this, Rosita? You must explain everything. Although I'm afraid what I have seen explains it only too well. Aunt don't think... - I don't have to think but to see. The very day to officially announce your engagement to as good a man as Don Serafin, doesn't merit such behaviour. Not that boy, aunt, he deserves our friendship. Yes, only our friendship, don't look at me so, ended without a farewell. I will never see him again. A friendship hidden from all. Love is hidden, not friendship. No, aunt, I love Serafin and I know he loves me. That he's good, that it's a wedding that suits us all at home. What more do you want? This was goodbye forever. Forever, what a reckless word to affirm neither love nor oblivion. Come, Rosita, you have a lot to tell me. With your heart on your sleeve. Let's see, Rosa, listen. Right now I really know more than you know yourself. I don't doubt your strong desire to love Serafin, to forget that boy you're in love with. Aunt! If you protest I will say in love. No doubt about your good intentions. - Then why doubt? Not at all, as I don't doubt that all your intentions will be useless. You're too young to understand. You can't play with love, much less hide it. Because then it becomes a ghost that haunts us a lifetime. A ghost? Never pronounce that word at home, alright? But sometimes in some corner as I pass by you will have heard say: "There comes do?a Juanita, with her ghost". I'll tell you the whole story that gave rise to this legend of mine. I don't know if it torments or comforts me. Some remember and tell it on winter nights. Others have already forgotten. I will never forget. It will help you to know, my child, that love doesn't compromise with lies and dissimulation. Look. It's me when I was 25. You look a lot like me, right? And him, do you have a picture? No, but imagine him like that other, who tried to jump the fence, that's him too. Why put a name and a face to something so eternal and similar. Look. It's a circus program. Many years ago, when I was young, a traveling circus came to town for the holidays such as we had never seen. Everyone came out to greet them with joy. Fix the post well. Still not positioned the organ? Must I be a carpenter too? Come on! Pull! Come on, hurry! Come on, we have work to do today! Ladies and gentlemen. First of all, a greeting from the Circus of Joy. Tonight's great sensational and extraordinary performance, 10 formidable attractions: Tony, with his lovely do?a Micaela. The Brothers Salvaret on the trapeze. Flying men. Human eagles. The Wizard of Tibet with his infinite trunk and great trombone. And now, the international tamer, famous throughout the five continents of the world and elsewhere. The beautiful Ernestina will present tonight her magnificent, unique and immeasurable collection of trained dogs. Did he say tamer? With dogs? - They'll be mad. A real firecracker. O la la. At the foot of the beautiful Ernestina, the world's press has cast a rain of flowers Showered with praise... Good heaven's, it's raining. Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget that tonight is the first... Don't move. Don't go. Oh, my God. Hopeless, all that leaping from trapeze to trapeze And then that, for a drop of water. Couldn't you do anything to stop them? Couldn't you extract from your moustache a few patriotic little words? And you? Why not play the national anthem? The public would have had to stand firm, unable to leave. This will be my ruin. This rain. And they said it never rained here for the fair, city propaganda. Just a moment, Pierre! Follow me, I have to talk. - Oui. It's the last time, you hear? The last time you exhibit me to the public before the performance. It's the public that comes to me! I'm an international star. Do you hear, a star! Yes, star, but take it easy. I've medals from shows in Vienna and Istanbul. Then I performed in Paris and London with my five Bengal panthers. I was accompanied to the hotel surrounded by lights. Bengal. But calm yourself. I want my adorable panthers or no one respects me. Now with my dogs I am nobody. What days they were for us, those five panthers and I. That's it... Calm down, I'm on edge. This rain will be my ruin. Who'll come out to see my circus? Is it my fault? My contract doesn't require me to tame the elements. You're quite right. But cover yourself up, don't go getting cold. It's ten, have the band enter. And it's raining, it's raining! I'm ruined. Get started. Don't forget that it's the inaugural performance. In the ring! Welcome to the Circus of Joy. I greet the stands and their intelligent audience. You will witness our first sensational act: Tony with his friend do?a Micaela. Attention! Mr. Tony, nice to meet you. I'm not called Matias. What about your family? I have no Emily. I just happened to see you pass. Blasa? I don't know any Blasa. I've no other family than this. Micaela greet this gentleman. Come on! Greet the public! Don't you have something to say to the public? Didn't you understand? Micaela wants to say Viva Villaclara! Nobody laughs at that idiot! Get out, another number! Music, pronto! One can see what a lot of training it takes. A steak? No man! I don't want any steak! Monsieur Tony, magnifique! You managed to make a child cry. What a success for a clown! We can't continue this way. That's how it is on an empty stomach. Don't apologize, Tony. You know my advice? Go look for work in a funeral home. And take your monkey to the zoo. It's first-day jitters. For you it should be the last. If I wasn't too impatient! Here, take it with both hands. Good appetite, eh? Yes, finish all the milk. Well, I'll take a walk to explore the city, eh, Micaela? As we only perform at night, we'll take a walk in the afternoon. You stay here and clean all the dishes. And not like the other day. Soap's not for eating, you can eat this. Goodbye, sweetheart. Here. Do you like it? - Yes. It's the Battle of Sotillo Bajo, Three leagues from here, in the time of Alfonso VIII. Most admirable is the white horse of the king. Note that, from wherever you look at it, it's always head on. It looks at you here, head on. You turn to look at it from here, head on too. - Very curious. And see in that corner, in a halo of light, Our Lady of the Hill, our patroness. The canvas is quite discoloured by moisture, but look carefully at the sweetness of the face, which one can also incidentally see from anywhere... - But Dad... Daughter, I'm sure this gentleman is interested in curiosities. Look. Note the crutch. The poor fellow had one leg shorter than the other. He was miraculously cured. That painting represents a bricklayer who saved the Virgin. It was on a very high scaffolding, slid... Who climbs scaffolding with one leg shorter than the other. No, that was lame Francisco. But Dad, he's not from Villaclara, he's not interested in all this. Of course he's not from Villaclara! That's why he must know not only the shrine but all the artistic monuments. And I am willing to teach them, if desired. Yes, sir, delighted. - You'll see. This chapel, the viceroy had it built, when old, in memory of a wonderful event that happened to him in Peru. Then the viceroy appealed to the woman and was able to raise her son. Wouldn't you have done the same as the viceroy? Ah! The same, the same. This is the blazon of Vazquez de Guzman: The lion and the two headed eagle. - He seems to be rather light headed. Good heavens, remarkable memory your father has. I read a lot. This is the sixth emblazoned house I've shown him. You said there are 16? Yes, but the others are for some other time. You should bring a notebook. I'll point out some interesting facts. May I offer you my house. But no concoctions. It's better not to need them. - Thank you very much. Laureano Izquierdo, daughter Juanita. And I'm... Antonio Ruiz. Have you perhaps come to the fair? - To the fair? No. Rather yes. I've come with the circus. - Are you an artist? No, good heavens. I'm employed by the management. I'm an accountant, you know? A purely administrative post. Excellent. Accounting is a poetry of sorts as everything is accurate. Mr. Ruiz, I hope to see you this afternoon at the Alameda. - Enjoy yourself, sir. Miss... How late you are. They've brought three prescriptions. We were teaching things to a stranger. Poor thing. - We'll see. What do you think, Micaela, is this elegant now? Because you know today I met the prettiest girl in the world. Don't be jealous, Micaela. Note that I said girl, I didn't say monkey. Come on. Wait. Wait a moment. I'll be right back. Then I'll pick you up. Where you going, Tony? For a stroll. - Make it a quick one. You know an hour before performance everyone must be at the circus. I'll be right back, sir, excuse me. Excuse me. May I have a glass of water? What a thirst! - I had to take a pill. Good afternoon, young man. Come in. Choose a cut-out, posture, I have all the backgrounds. I have Venice, Giralda, a pass of of Mazantini. Please, lift you head. Please. That's 3 reales. Hey, wait, the photo! It's 3 reales. Gentlemen, go through the infernal tunnel. Come, gentlemen. Pay on the way out. In case of danger pull the cord Come, gentlemen. Pay on the way out. Come, gentlemen. The infernal tunnel. Go in or sit. Wait, take Micaela to the circus, she's tired. I'll be along later. - OK, but don't be late. Good evening, don Laureano. - How are you, Mr. Ruiz. Are you taking a liking to Villaclara? - It's beautiful. You say it as a matter of form, you'll have travelled everywhere. Yes, I've traveled, I should think so. - Join us to hear the band for a while. It's not a brass band, sir. Please, excuse me. This way, through here. You first, no getting lost. Will you allow me a seat, sir? - Yes, sir. Not at all, you're a young lad. - No, allow me. The new director has has an ear for the classics. This year he has a brilliant version of Liszt's "Dream of Love". It'll leave you open-mouthed, but invigorated. The circus organ plays it too but it sounds quite different. It'll be the company. - Such nice company. Hello! The Estivils. The finest men are at the fair. - And the most suspicious women, right? Especially with those who go from fair to fair. Like sailors who go from port to port. Haven't you seen such an operetta? No. - Hello. Torre ?lvarez. I love it when your friends appear. - Why? To see you smile. - I don't love it so much. At each fair we must provide gossip, from one year to the next. Gossip, you can't do that from memory. Look, at your father, invigorated with this waltz. The music brings back many things. Just imagine, I hear this waltz every day at the circus. Not with you. Try your luck? Two goes, one for the girl. Try, Juanita. - I have lousy luck. Two. - Unlucky in this... Let me see. Come on zero. Zero, zero. 15. Do you want me to be unlucky in the game too? Why? - That's impossible. So you had an argument with your parents. Right, with my parents. I could have at home everything I wanted but I chose to live for myself. It's always attracted me, a free life and struggle. I became an accountant. I just happen to be in the circus. But I'm looking for something better. The circus is a sad thing behind its apparent joy. It must be so, especially the clowns? Forcing a laugh every day. Always pretending. Yes, all that pretend... We didn't realize, they're playing "The Dream of Love." Dad. "The dream". - What dream? "Dream of Love", they are playing it. Oh yes. Magnificent. Wonderful, wonderful. What did you think of "The Dream"? Wonderful. It transports me, I'm enraptured. We are almost alone. Good taste is finished. No one listens to the last piece which is always classical. Some go to the booths, others go to the circus. The circus. It will have already begun. Certainly. Of course, the talk was so nice. I have to leave to take care of the collection. You'll forgive me if I don't come with you. Delighted, Juanita. Tomorrow I hope to see you again. - Tomorrow you shouldn't miss the fireworks. - No, I won't miss them. Good night. Goodbye, Mr. Ruiz. 23:30 ! It's the last time he'll do this to me. The last! Is he here? - No, sir. He should have arrived two acts ago. Unreliable. Here I am, Mr. Brochard. Now! You see... - We'll talk later! The audience won't laugh at you and you won't laugh at me. The waltz... - Shut up! Go get dressed. Yes, right away. What is it? - Let me in, I must get dressed right away. Me too, it's my number. Yes, but... Take it, cutie. Get out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, in response to the public of Villaclara, a sensational number, Amaru and his panthers. Amaru, the Indian from Bengal will be enclosed in the cage with the beasts. Release the panthers! Don't move! Moron, what have you done! At this moment the panthers advance on the cage. Look at Amaru's impassive smile. What about my Panthers? I'm changing it for another number! I don't care about you. I'm betrayed by my enemy. I don't think goats have any outstanding account with you. Who was it? Who's to blame? - Tony! Tony will hear from me. Out on the street! Out on the street! The box to the ring. You're going to witness the most difficult and unexpected experiment. The beautiful and statuesque Tulima will disappear before your very eyes. Tulima is introduced into the enchanted box. Nothing here, nothing there and nothing around here. And the beautiful Tulima no longer exists in the world of corporeal people. This is the limit Come on, say hello. Come on. Get in. Silence! Everyone to their posts. The performance continues. Don't count, Tony, on my smile in the ring. That was only for the public. You've ruined my whole program and it won't happen again. Pierre, are you coming to tighten my corset? Come on, I'm in a hurry. Right away. I don't understand your hurry, Juanita. It's still not time for Mr. Ruiz to come and get me. And young people are never punctual. I think you're quite wrong. He's been punctual. Good evening. I wasn't expecting you. How punctual. You almost caught me looking a mess. You never look a mess. - You shouldn't. This is too much. How beautiful they are, Mr. Ruiz. Will you wear one, Juanita? Anyway, it's holiday time. How are you? - Well, and you? Very punctual, as I like it. My sister Eloisa. At your service, ma'am. - Look at these beautiful flowers. Very lovely. We mustn't delay, it's time for the fireworks. Goodbye, ma'am. Bye. You see, Mr. Ruiz, something interesting. Then everything was different. This way. - Thank you. Oh, those fireworks where Villaclara celebrated the entry of Alfonso XII, "The Peacemaker"! The last fireworks were heard in the farmhouse of la Revuelta. Juanita! The same one as the other day. - Who could it be? They are... - No, don't tell me. I know them, they're affected! Tickets, please. No, my turn. I won't insist... Here. Excuse me, two reales, because of the fireworks. Fine. Tell me, Juanita, is there a quieter place, more peaceful where...? Do you want your good fortune told? Leave me alone! - Give me at least a little something, from a gentleman for his girl which is a woman's gift. Here. - God bless you, sir. Juanita. If it were true what that woman said... Let's see, but as Don Alfonso... Not bad, but those which were lit to celebrate the entry of the Peacemaker... Juanita! Did you like the fireworks? - Yes. You liked the sail boat firing a small cannon? - Yes, very nice. There was no boat! How late. - Yes. Let's see if it happens to you like yesterday. No, I didn't mean it that way, only in the sense of a pleasant afternoon spent. It's 10, one hour before they close the ticket office. Until then, I don't have to go take care of the collection. What a crowd and mixing of classes. In my day, the masses walked along the Alameda Baja and people of status on the Alameda Alta. But now everything is democracy and stomping! You feel, Juanita, that there are too many people? No doubt a few too many. - I think they all are. Oh, look, a Ferris wheel! I'd love... - What? You'd love to go up on the Ferris wheel? It seems rather risky. - Why, Dad? Last year I went with the Garcia Alvarezes and it was delightful. Do you want to see if this year is delightful too without Garcia Alvaro? - You wouldn't mind, Dad? The fair is a crazy time. Go. I'll wait for you down here. Don't worry, Don Laureano. These devices are very well built. So was the Queen Regent. Don't worry, you'll see. This way, Juanita. Bye, Dad, don't panic, we've got a return ticket. Careful, don't stand. Goodbye, don Laureano. - We're going up. You can't get dizzy with your eyes closed. You close yours, I'll keep mine open. Why make fun of me? I'll open mine too. Suspicious, it was to look at the scenery. I'm on top of the world, like an eagle. It doesn't last long! - We're going into an abyss. There's no danger? - What danger do you mean? Which would it be? Close your eyes and see. The danger remains the same, Juanita. Because with closed eyes, I'm still watching you. They say that one day men will invent an apparatus to fly through the air. Why not? We're half way there. - Would you dare to fly? With you by my side, yes. It would be delightful to go as we are now, detached from the earth, from reality. Up... up! And you by my side. Put your trust in me. - None of your clowning. Clowning? Now we dropping. - Oh! I'm seasick! Be brave, Juanita. In a moment we'll be back up. What are you doing here, don Laureano? I get dizzy just looking at that infernal device. I'm waiting for Juanita. Look at her. Yes, she's in heaven. We can wait for her in that room without being crushed. What's happening down there? Do you know what's happening? - How awful! Let me through. What's happening? Don't panic. It'll be nothing. A pickpocket, but they'll have got him. All fairs are the same. And dad? He was watching, I don't see him. I can't see him. What do we do? Looking for your father is rather difficult now. Want me to accompany you home, Juanita? - No! Let's do one thing. Accompany me to the farmers' stall. He's a member and may be there. What a good idea. Let's go. Yes, let's. Excuse me? Have you seen Don Laureano, the pharmacist? No, lady. - Thank you. Then let's go. Juanita. You have to compensate me for the trip on the Ferris Wheel they've stolen from us. - What do you want? A pasodoble, it's the easiest. - No. - Yes. Well, a little turn, nothing more. - Thank you. What a bore! No outsiders this year. The runts of the litter. The same who came to the last fair. - The same from the mass in '12. Look. Rosarito Galvez, how insistent! 20 fairs and nothing. And look at Pilar Urrute, at the old stall she met the one they say called on Wellington. There's only one way to kill this afternoon. Start a fight. Of course, like last year. Let's put the mayor's hat in the piano. No, last year it cost us a hat and maybe this year it'll cost the piano. Look out. The queen of cream. The pharmacist's daughter and dressed like a chocolate box. And with a conquest, who is it? A stranger. He has an unlucky face. The face you need to dance with "la jarabito". What do you think if they pass close again, sing in chorus? Very good, in chorus! This pasodoble never ends. - Are you dizzy here too? Don't be silly, I'm worried about Dad. - One more would be nice. One, two, one, two cough drops for you That was meant for us? - No, what nonsense. Every year at the fair they sing nonsense. They haven't realized. - How stupid. - Look at the eyes she's making. He doesn't look like a carny. - They're back! After three. Hey, what if we say this? No, that's too much. One, two, one, two cough drops for you Let me, Juanita. - No, for God's sake, pay no attention. I'd appreciate it if you've something to say, say it to my face. Don't be angry, young man. It's an advert that we've been hired to do for her father. Cough drops. American advertising. I must tell you right now... Tie your tie, you'll talk better without that knot in your throat. Mind where you are. - Don't worry about that. At the farmers' stall people get slapped every year. If there were no ladies... Ladies like lively men, isn't that so, sweetie? You'll give satisfaction to this lady. To her no, but to you if you insist... A doctor! Didn't you hear? A doctor. Isn't there a doctor here? There's no doctor but here's the pharmacist. Let me go, what have I to do with these barbarians? A vet is what they need. Or rather a teacher. - But if they've hurt someone. Come. Leave it for the Red Cross, dammit. I'm looking for my daughter. I don't want any trouble. Dad! - Daughter! Dad, look at Mr. Ruiz. What is it? Did he fall from the gondola? It's nothing. A little shock. Do you feel better? - Better, yes. Thank you. It's all been for my sake. - You're the only good thing around here. Can you walk alright? - Yes. - Come on. I'm very grateful to you. - Let's get out of here. It's all in decline. They were alright, the fireworks, but no... Those for the entrance of Alfonso XII, the Peacemaker. They cost a packet, you know? - Yes, I believe what I know. They claimed to have heard the explosion in the farmhouse of La Arrebuena. Yes, that's it. Good night, Mr. Ruiz. - I hope we'll meet again. - Of course. Good night. - Juanita, there's only one day left of the fair and one night. Don't you think I deserve...? Yes, you deserve it for your worth. Be aware that if I agree, through the bars, don't commit yourself. Here in Villaclara, when it comes to strangers at the fair it means nothing. Juanita, through the bars it's life imprisonment. And a fortnight for the pickpockets who come to the fair. And good luck, my father's waiting for me to turn off the light and lock the door. Eleven. They must have started the performance. Tomorrow, Juanita. - Tomorrow. Really? - Really. Good morning, Don Elpidio. - What a morning. A confession, right? - Maybe. But not in a confessional. Rather to ask your advice. I want to confess but not a sin. Fine. We'll go to the sacristy. Tell me, my child. - Father, you see... The fact is, you see... - I'll see if you tell me what to see. It's nothing, father. A stranger has asked me out. Because of the fair? - Yes, father. He's with the circus. Beware, these globetrotters are people of low reputation. Living for their flings. - No, father, not that, he's an artist. A boy from a good family and to show his parents he can assert himself, he has left to make his own way. He does the circus accounts. - That's something else. Yes, an administrative position. Still, he wants to leave the circus as soon as possible and look for something more important. Good, don't tell me any more, my child. I'll find out. I'll check all that. Perhaps tomorrow come to your house and tell you what I think. You deserve much, Juanita. The town has too little and the world too much. Think well what you do. But Dad hasn't told you anything yet. - No, don't worry. Good morning. It's automatic? - Yes, sir. It moves with a small electric motor. I wanted to know if you've any half price tickets, for children under seven. - Just a moment. There's a priest who's asking for tickets for children under seven. Good morning, Father, will you come in? Come in. I wondered if you had any half price tickets, for children under seven. Of course, private soldiers and children half price. Are you asking for a school? - No. Sit down? - I was told to ask for Antonio Ruiz, the accountant. You're not Mr. Ruiz? Mr. Ruiz? They said Mr. Ruiz? No, I'm not. How could I be, I mean, how could I be at this time. I'm sorry, I would have liked to speak to him. My friends know him well, they've told me much about him. They've talked about him, your friends. He too will be upset not being able to meet you, Father. A guy so good, so religious. - So religious! Very much so, we all love him here, so kind, so intelligent. A boy from a good family. He's here out of self-respect, to make his own way in life. Good, good. - He carries it all. He's the real driving force, but the circus is too narrow to him. He'll move on to higher things, you know. You bet he will. - Tony. How come you've not put those posters up! Don't hand around any longer. - No sir, no. Didn't you hear, you've not stuck the posters up! I don't have any posters. Don't answer back, you see me holding them and can't come and ask for them. Here! Come on. Excuse me, with these people you've no choice but to raise your voice. Only Ruiz, the accountant, makes himself obeyed without shouting. What a way he has, a real gem. - I won't disturb you any more, sir. Thank you for your time. You'll surely cross paths with Ruiz along the way. Yes, but I don't know him. You'll know him immediately, to your liking, for his friendly nature. Father, come in. Good day, son and I'm very grateful for your information. I'm always at your service. Good morning. - Have a good day. Excuse me. I was in a hurry. Here, I'll do this, thanks. Take it, for shouting at you earlier. Yes, Machuca, in Punta Fantasmas, none were as famous as that in Villaclara, in '55, it has rained ever since. It was white, gigantic, with luminous eyes. Couldn't you talk about something else? It was pursued by the Civil Guard, but they couldn't find it. For a long time, the year '55 was for Villaclara, the year of the ghost. I've heard of one that was in Torrejon Alto that flew through the air and called at the windows. They say it stole a child. I don't mind admitting this. They are usually manifestations of an evil spirit. In the Middle Ages, there was the incubus. These were nothing but the fantastic forms the enemy took. Juanita, would you go look for my matchbox? Yes, Dad. Often it took that form to visit maidens it fell in love with and some became pregnant. Careful, don Laureano, that's not acceptable in a healthy orthodoxy. Your matches, Dad. But it's not necessary to resort to that evil spirit. Many times, our own spiritual creations come to acquire bodily form. Heavens, Machuca, don't you start with these gruesome bedtime tales. Listen. They're not tales. In my house, my parents created a fantastic being, to scare my brothers' kids when they misbehaved. They called him Fray Andr?s, as he might have been called otherwise. They give him his own properties and distinctions. Fray Andres had a white beard, a black habit and eyes that shone like those of a wolf. Finally one day, I remember it perfectly, in autumn, early in the evening, we were gathered before supper in the living room. There was no more light than that of an oil lamp. The adjoining corridor, remained in a half gloom. One of my little brothers, had misbehaved. My mother threatened him, saying Fray Andr?s was coming. Then in the gloom of the corridor we saw pass a tall friar, with a black habit, a white beard and wolf-like eyes. We all saw it, no doubt about it. It was Fray Andr?s. Why do you say these things just before bedtime? Mr. Machuca was afraid of your heretical ideas. It's 1:15, if you'll allow me, I'm going to retire. Good night, daughter. Good evening everyone. Ah, Juanita. I forgot to tell you, tomorrow afternoon, we've a meeting of the needlework guild. You can rest easy, my child. I learned that Mr. Ruiz is an excellent person. - Thank you, father. Antonio! What's the matter, Juanita? You seem frightened. Are you afraid of me? - Not you, Antonio. It is that I'd made up my mind, you could be a ghost and reaching the window would vanish into thin air. - A ghost, me? Disappear, me? Why did you think that, Juanita? - It's silly. At Dad's gathering tonight, all the talk was of ghosts and scary stuff and the hallway was so dark. But no matter. There are other things starting to be clear. - Tell me. They've told me of you. - Who? I'm not naming names. Did they speak well? Yes, very well. You have very good friends. Yes, very good. Juanita, I wanted to say one thing about me. You've you found a position outside the circus? Is that it? Because it's true, the circus, if you have to, yes. But if not, something else is better. That's what I wanted to say. I'll soon have something better, broader horizons. And then I'll come back with my parents to sort all this out. Will you really come back? - I don't want to go. When is the circus going? - We finish tomorrow, but I'll write at each stop. So tomorrow is the final performance. Nothing else happened? - What else? I suppose the circus accountant can send two tickets for the farewell show for a good friend to go with her dad. I think so, as you wish. You took the words right out of my mouth. What joy. Then, tomorrow... Yes, I'll send them or bring them myself. Are you happy? - Quiet, Antonio. How about it? She's the daughter of Don Laureano, one can't recognise him from behind. Surely an outsider. The fair, but how quiet he was about it. When least expected. Good night, Don Pancho. Not as much as that young couple. The best possible. Good-bye, good night. Engracia, Engracia! Pancho. - I've got some news. News! - I just met Sixto Olivares in Encarnaci?n street, there was a couple talking through the Laureano railings. She was his daughter, him I didn't know. Really? - Really. At this hour? - At this hour. - The girls of today. You say Sixto Olivares also saw them? And has told his wife. - Yes. What a pity. - Why? Because his wife leaves early for the needlework guild. - So? She'll tell them before me. - That's true. A scandal, my husband saw him. It must have been four in the morning. What hours for a girl. Of course, your husband was returning from night worship. A man's another thing. Have you heard of Don Laureano's daughter? - Yes, they told me. It was two in the night when they saw them talking through the bars. Have you figured out who he is? - No, maybe he's a clerk with those who have just arrived. It was gone three when they were seen. They say he's a military man. A lieutenant at least. I was just going down your street. The bars in the railings are like this. Wait, wait. I don't listen to gossip, but I want to hear it from your own lips, daughter. Is it true what I heard? - It's true, what you've seen. Mr. Ruiz, is not my boyfriend. He accompanied me those days at the fair. We get on well, we talked. - Through the railings. You know it's customary here with the fair. And, are you interested? A little, Dad. He's very nice to me. He's just just sent us these two tickets for the final show. Very fine detail. The big surprise. The act of Toni and the monkey do?a Micaela. I don't find clowns funny. - I do. But there a wild animals. That's usually interesting and instructive in a way. In short, Juanita, we despise the gossip of the unemployed. No! Now, now! We are committed to the program. We have announced this number as a big surprise. The surprise is they'll throw something at us. In time. In time. The rhythm is more modern! - No, no, no. I'm a big name, you mustn't get out of step. What matters is the dance, a straight line. And you think a straight line matters in this dance? Well... It's almost time. You have to get ready. Micaela. You think she'll know me if I lay on the make-up? Isn't that right? And my voice? Ladies and gentlemen...! My God, she'll know my voice. Dear Juanita: I have a confession to make. Antonio Ruiz is, in a way, the non- existent ghost you feared last night. That is not my name, I have no parents, nor have I ever been an accountant. I am a clown, unfunny and with no future... The only truth of it all is that I wish I had been all that I said and more, so that I could... Packed to the rafters. Come on, get ready. Warn Tony. I'm already here. Bravo, Tony. Good makeup. It looks like you want to do justice to the farewell performance. Is it really fine? Out of the way, you're always in the way. Sorry. Have you no other place to sit! On with the second act. Tony, get ready, your number's first.. Can't we wait a few minutes? I don't feel well. I've lost my voice. Ladies and gentlemen. In response to the public of Villaclara, who have honoured us with their special attention, we dedicate this last, farewell performance, culminating in a great surprise. First number, Tony with his partner do?a Micaela. Come on, Tony, are you asleep? Get in the ring. Good evening, Mr. Tony. Good evening, do?a Micaela. Are you enjoying yourself in Villaclara? Let's see what this is. The first number is usually just filling. - Of course. Mr. Tony. You know it's forbidden to play here. Is it forbidden to play here? - Yes. Mr. Tony, didn't I say it's forbidden to play here! Not here, there. The man said "here", referring to the circus. But the clown thought he meant the place before. So he said, "not here, there". Now, a trick with no hands, despite appearances. Is there a gentleman in the audience with a watch? Me. Is it gold? - Yes, Mr. Tony. Well, congratulations. Good. That was a joke, but now, I'll do a real one. I'll make it disappear. Micaela, you take care of them while I prepare my things. Nothing here, nothing there. If a member of the public, wants to examine it, they can. Micaela, didn't I tell you to take care of them? Leave it. Micaela! What do you say? Just padding and quite bad. Thank goodness the wild animals will be coming. It's terrible, terrible! We must warn the public, hurry! Get out of the way, there's a fire! I haven't got the insurance with The Napolitan yet. We must warn them! Is there any danger to the public? Get out, everyone! Get out! There's a fire! Relax, relax! This must be the big surprise! Just kidding. For pity's sake. It's true! There's a fire! Up there! Juanita, my girl! Dad. Juanita! There's a fire! Fire at the fair! Fire! Fire? There's a fire on the esplanade. - Then it must be at the fair. Hurry, my helmet, come on, run! Duty comes first. Dolores, my helmet. What is it? - The mayor says the circus is on fire. What? I'll come right away. Wait. Don't rush. The pump. Where did you put the pump? No fire brigade! The pump. Have the firefighters arrived? Are they already busy? Now, when there is no hope. Hurry! Water on! I'm ruined, no insurance with La Napolitan. Relax. For the next year we budgeted for an excellent fire service. If the fire had been in January... Shut up! Have you seen my father? - No. Have you seen my father? - I think he was to the left. He was looking for you. Fire brigade! Sir, do you know anything about don Antonio Ruiz, the accountant? there's no Antonio Ru?z in accounting, mademoiselle. Do you know anything about Antonio Ruiz, the accountant? There is no Antonio Ruiz. Daughter! - Dad. Are you okay? - I asked about Mr. Ruiz and they don't know him. - They told me the same. Dad, what do you know? What have they told you? Nothing, I've been all over the city. No one knows him. He's not among the victims, that's for sure. No more dead than what they said last night. The photographer's wound was minor. Only Lopez's child and that little clown is dead. - Which one? That unfunny one. Poor thing. Then how do you explain this? Hasn't that boy tricked us? That he was a traveller at the fair and was leaving on tomorrow's train. No, it's not possible. What's happening? It's the burial of the victims, I'll take a look from the pharmacy. There's no one downstairs. In two days all the artists have gone, first Mr. Brochard, the Frenchman, the Circus of Joy has vanished into thin air. Perhaps the fire was the wrath of God. - Why? They say it was a very decent show. Hey, Laureano, what about that boy who spent some afternoons with you? Nothing, a friend of the fair, we heard no more about him. I don't believe he was employed by the circus. - I think so. At the circus they told me about him. They gave me excellent reports. Someone in authority told me he was a great guy. I couldn't get anyone to give me any news on him. - I could. Now I can't repeat it. I believe the one who talked to me was the clown they buried that afternoon. How strange. What if he was a ghost? One shouldn't believe it, but you tell such tales. Let's see if there's a second ghost for Villaclara this year. Please forgive me, it's late. Good night. Till tomorrow, dad. From that day on was born in the city the legend of The Ghost and do?a Juanita It was said that I had been loved by a ghost, a disembodied spirit, and I once believed it myself. However, when I think of him I really think not. He was real, may he rest in peace. The warmth of his hands. I lived with such an absurd hope. If he were to return... Aunt Juanita. Now when a door opens unexpectedly, I can't help but shiver... You can't hide love. Ma'am... A problem, the spirits haven't arrived. Luckily the guests are also delayed. More will be delayed. Let them know, the party has been delayed for a few days. Aunt, what are you saying? What are you going to do? I'll have to resign myself like you to having loved a ghost. Everything has a remedy except death. Isn't it a little like death, what's happened to me? There is only one true death. When it approaches one will tackle anything. Aunt, what are you saying? Society page Marriage proposal As a result of a mistake by our reporter, we announced the upcoming marriage of the beautiful Miss Rosita Izquierdo to Don Serafin Gonz?lez, when in fact it is the young Don Jos? Palacios who is to lead her to the altar. This afternoon a party will be held at the home of Miss Juanita Izquierdo to announce the event to the bride and groom's relatives and friends. This is a dream and it seems at any moment that I'll wake up. Why? - The whole thing seems out of this world. Quiet. Don't talk of such things. - Why not? So the ghost of do?a Juanita will bring us happiness. Subtitles: corvusalbus
