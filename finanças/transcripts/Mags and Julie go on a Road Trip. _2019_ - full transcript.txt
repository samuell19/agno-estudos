Running a little behind today, are we, Maggie? Make sure he's happy, and he's ready to go. We need this to be airtight. I need... If we have lunch at 1:30, we're just going to get drinks. Mojitos. And I need to know that you know on the 22nd of June. - Where was I? - Um, lunch. - I'm past lunch. We're doing dinner. - Dinner. Do you know why I called you in here? Come around. See what you did wrong? I said, Helvetica New Age Ultra Light! Okay. Now go back around. The other thing you did wrong is you brought me, ah, Waldorf salad when I asked for a cobb salad. Okay? I don't like cranberries. I like hard boiled eggs. Now get out of here. - Hey. - Hi. - How you doing? - Fine, I'm fine. Okay. All right. So I know it can be a little much and sometimes overwhelming. But, what did he say to you? Um, he said he didn't like the color of my font or... - Okay. He's just really particular about it. - Yeah. So if you see here, - you've got this whole color grid. - Mm-hmm. You're going to pick the marine blue, and he likes cobalt. - Okay. - It's just he likes blue. So, yeah. - He didn't like my green. - Yeah. Um... Maggie! Maggie. Don't forget the Miller Meeting on Friday. - I know. - And I need the Keller production schedule by tonight. Bye. - Sorry. I'm late. - I ordered for you. Thank you. - Urgh! - This is a rare occurrence. - I haven't seen you in months. - I know. It's been project after project, and I've barely had a moment to breathe. And honestly, I don't know, I'm a little burnt out. Why don't you take some time off? - Right. - Seriously, when was the last time you had a vacation? I don't know. I think, your wedding. Four years ago. Has it been that long? Yes. Okay, okay. Before that? Uh... I don't know. When I had time off, I guess it was... when we went skiing. Six years ago. - That's not good. - Hey. My friend Beth is opening a new art gallery. Look. - Cool. - Look! - Yeah. - She's looking for artists. So? So you're an artist. Jules, I don't show my art. And I don't want more work. Hello. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah, I can get it, yeah. Okay. Bye. I hate to do this. I have to go. I just got a last-minute proposal. - Please stay. - There's a meeting in the morning. - I got to go. - Please. I have to. I have to work. Jules. - Give me my phone. - We're having dinner. Jules, this isn't funny. Give me my phone. Give me my phone. Give me my phone, Jules! Give it. Let go of my phone! It's my phone! Not cool. I will call you. Hey. Hey. Mags, I got to tell you something. What? Okay. I'm really mad at you. Like, I barely see you for two months, and then, I finally see you, and you bail. I'm sorry. I know it's bad. Yeah, like, really bad, like, you have no life. Hang on, my Mom's calling me. Um, I'll call you back, okay? Mom? Hi, honey. Are you still working? Yeah, of course. Oh, honey, it's one a.m. Mom, I know. Is... um, is everything okay? Why are you calling so late? I'm calling about your grandfather. He passed away peacefully in his sleep. I guess we were expecting that, right? Well, yeah, yeah. Um, the good thing is... he left without a lot of pain. Good. Are you okay? Your father mentioned that your grandfather left you a cabin in his will. Cabin? Since when did he have a cabin? He owned it with his brothers, and they all died. He was the last one. You know, I think he went up there with his parents when he was a kid that long ago. It's up in Rhinelander, Margaret. Margaret, you really should get some sleep. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Yeah, you, too. That's weird. I... All right, I love you. Oh, I love you, honey. Hello. Hey. Um... Can we talk tomorrow? Yeah, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I mean, my, um, my grandfather passed away. Oh, Mags. Are you okay? Yeah. Um... It was expected. So I mean... it's just weird, you know? Ah, listen. I have to get back to work. So I'm sorry about earlier. Um, but I'll, I'll call you tomorrow. I'm coming over. No. No. Julie? I brought Kringle. Devin's coming over. He had a late shift at work. You know, I'm really fine. I mean, my grandfather hasn't been doing well for months, so... Like, of course, we would be there for you. Yeah, well, I haven't exactly been there for you lately. Hello. You're my best friend. No! Oh, he's here. She's in the bedroom. Hey, there, stranger. Hey, there. I forgot. You work late like me. You still work for that Devil boss? Mags likes to be tortured, I guess. I don't like to be tortured. I like to work. And I'm working toward a promotion. Didn't you say that a year ago? Did I? Mags got... - a cabin in the woods from her grandpa. - Where is it? Rhinelander. I didn't even know he had a cabin. It's pretty up there. There's lots of pine trees. It's scary up there, lots of guns. Scary? What. We should go. Yeah, like, I don't mind guns. It would be fun. No, no, no, no, no. I don't have time to go anywhere. No, let's just go. You need time off. We'll go this weekend. You need a weekend off. Mags. Please, please, please, please! Okay, okay, okay. If I say yes... will the two of you please leave my house? Okay. Fine. Yes. - Yay! - Yay! - You know what I'm talking about. - Sir. Your wife called. - Ah, to remind you about the recital tonight. - Ah. Oh! All right. Sure. Sure. That's for my ratty nephew. His parents think he can sing. He can't. Uh, here are... the proposals for the... Weber deal, Keller deal and the e-Founders deal. Fine, just don't forget the Jettison Engines group. You know you, always forgetting things. You'd think after four years, you'd remember the fine details. Six. - Six what? - Six years. I've worked here for six years. - Four, six, does it really matter? - Not really. It looks like you left the taxes out on this one. Okay, I'll take care of that. Sir, I have a quick question. What? My grandfather died. Is that a question? No, it's just... I was just hoping that I could take the weekend off. Well, we have four proposals due, and I have the golf tournament on Saturday. It's Friday, Maggie. I know. It's just... I haven't had time off in, like, four years so... Maggie. People die all the time. It's life. Life happens. But you can't let it slow you down. You keep going, otherwise, how would we get any work done around here? Let's be honest and certainly if your job matters to you at all, you'll keep with the manifesto of this company. You can work hard, but you can always work harder. Yeah. Now I expect these proposals, and... I need you to be available during the tournament. I got to be able to ask you any question about anybody, because honestly, you're the only one that knows. I'm horrible with names and faces. You know that. Maggie... I'm so sorry for your loss... but this train keeps moving. And I know you want to be on that train, right? Yeah. Am I right? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I... I get it. I'll, um... do the proposals. I'll be available during the tournament, and, um, yeah, we'll get it done. Good. So you hear me? - Yeah. - You're sure you hear me? Right? You're not deaf, right? No, I'm not deaf. I hear you. Good. I know you're working towards that promotion. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. - I have been, yeah. - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah. - Yeah! - Yeah. - Yeah, let's get it. - Okay. - Let's get it. Okay. Bye. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. You know we're going camping, right? What? Are you excited about vacation? - Kind of. - What? I still have to work. Um, there's just too much going on this weekend. Ugh. Okay, we'll... We get to hang out together, and I made us a playlist! - Enyou. - Enya? - No, that's not right. - Oh, my God. Watch out! I'm sorry, we were listening to En... we were listening to Enyou. - Oh. Okay, do you need me to drive? - No. This way, you can work. I have snacks. I licorice. I have chocolate chips. I have chips for nachos. I have cleaning supplies for the cabin. And look at this. - Do you see this guy? Look at him. - Yeah. "Hi, I'm a gnome. I'll be on your front yard." Mwah. Love this guy. Cheers. Yeah. Yeah, uh-huh. Coffee. I don't know. For some reason, he likes it when I make it, when I get it. He doesn't like it when other people get it. Even though it's the same coffee. Yeah. Just tell him. No. Hi. Yes. Um, I'm in a car. I'm headed up North. Yeah, I... I told you. Yeah, I told you I was going to do that. No, I can. I totally can. I'm not going to... I'm not going to screw it up. I promise. Before ten, I... I am a yes man. Yes. Yes, I am a yes man! Woo woo! On that train. Yep. Hey, don't you have to pee? I don't have time to pee. Oh! - What was that? - I don't know. - Pull over there. - All right. - Weird. - Yeah. - See anything? - No. Is it an axle maybe? Or... Oh. Shoot, the tire blew. - Oh, that blows. - I don't know how to change a tire. Well, I think I've changed a tire before. I mean, I don't... like, I don't remember, but I... - I think I've changed one. - Okay, okay. Well, just Google... Google how to change a tire. - There's no service. - What? - What? - I'll try another location. Okay, let's walk around. What the hell? - Arrgh! - Anything? No, dude, it's crazy. Well... I mean, I guess we got to figure it out, right? - Yeah. No. - Can't be that hard, right? - I'm going to go inside the Google in my mind. - Okay. Oh, oh! I got one off. - Mags? - Yes? Don't be mad. Why would I? Um. There's no spare tire. Your husband has a car without a spare tire? Yeah. I don't know. We bought it used. Maybe they, like, used it. Jules. Look at me. Look at me! Maggie. Maggie, I have an idea. Why don't we just wait here until someone comes along to help us? Someone comes along to help us? We're been out here for a half an hour, and there hasn't been a single car. Why don't we just walk back to the gas station? No, Mags, that's scary. The gas station is an hour away by car. The next town's ten miles that way. Okay, we'll just stay here. If we walk, it's going to be dark by the time we get anywhere. You know have faith. Good vibes. Vibes? I don't think vibes are going to cut it, Jules. I just think, you know, we could... we could just set the car up like we're going to go camping, you know. Just put the thing down, and we could sleep here, - you know? - Someone is going to come. Jules... Oh, my goodness, I was right! Hey! Hey, friend, hey, friend, hey, hey, friend. - Hey. - Hey, there. - Oh, sorry. - You girls all right out here? No, we're not. We got a flat tire, and we don't have a spare. And we don't have cell phone service. Ah, yeah, reception sucks out here. About a mile up the road, it comes back, but... I told you. Hey, can you give us a ride to the next town? Or maybe a gas station? I can give you a lift up to the motel, but the gas station is closed now. Jack is the owner, and he can help you out with your car. But he doesn't open till seven a.m. tomorrow. - You want a lift to the motel? - Yes! Oh. Okay. Well, grab your stuff, and I'll take you. - Thank you, you are a lifesaver. - Oh, you bet. Hey, do you think it's a good idea? Don't you think we should just camp out? Do you think this nice man's going to murder us? Hey, you girls hungry? I got venison jerky. - No, we have candy. - Oh, okay. - Open there. - Oh, thank you. - So what's your name? - Uh. I'm Julie. That's Mags. I'm a graphic designer and a wife. I throw clay. Mags is this amazing painter, but, yeah, she works for this terrible guy. He shall not be named. We're both from Milwaukee. We're going to go see Mags' new cabin. Her grandpa left it for her in his will, but that was really surprising to her because, honestly, she didn't even know he had a cabin. Ha! Well, it's nice to meet you both. I'm Steve. Um, I'm a local, I live about 20 miles up county road C. Now the motel owner is June. And her pop just passed away, and she owns it now. Lucky I ran into you now. You can tell her Steve sent you. Oh, that's really nice of you. - Ah, Steve. - Yeah? Is there internet at the motel? Ah! That's a good question. I... I have no idea. I know there's that coffee shop that has a Wi-Fi, but that's, like, 20 miles away. And unfortunately, I got to get home. I can only take you as far as the motel, but June... June's full of surprises. She... she just might have some Wi-Fi in there. Thank you. Maggie, are you trying to get fired? I knew I shouldn't have let you go. I knew it. It was my mistake, and now you're messing up my life! And my company's going down the tubes with. - Okay. - He sounds mad. Yeah, well, at least I have service. Hi, there. How can I help you? - Hi. - Hi. How can I help you? We just got dropped off by this guy, Steve. Uh, we need a hotel for the night. Our tire blew up the road there. - Your tire blew? - Yeah. Oh, that's rough. I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, I can call Jack Junior in the morning to have him handle that for you. What kind of tire do you need? Um, we have a hatchback. Hatchback, hatchback. Well, I... I don't know, but he will. He has a whole service station with all that kind of stuff, uh, tires, oil. - That would be dandy. - Yep. We need two rooms, please. No, we just need one room, two beds. No, we need two rooms. I have to work all night, and I don't want to bother you. So two rooms. No, I don't care. We came here together. We're going to get one room, two beds. Okay, yeah. Um, for one night, uh, one room. Oh, room one. Um, it's the last one on the end, and it will be $55. Plus tax, which is three dollars, so your total's $58. Your name's June, right? Yeah, I'm June. Um, we didn't have dinner. - So what do we do? - Oh! Oh, my God! You guys are on an adventure. Well, I do have some snacks for sale, ah, peanuts, seltzer water, cinnamon rolls, stuff like that. Oh! Um... Yeah, I'll take all of this. I mean, cinnamon rolls are really good for dinner, right? Yeah, they are. And you know what? I feel so bad for you guys that I'm going to give it to you wholesale. Ten dollars even, plus tax. Okay. Yep, that will cover it. And you know, we're... we're all closed up in five minutes. Um... it's Bingo Night. Last time I went, I won $500! It was... it was totally worth it. So I mean... so I'll... I'll see you in the morning for check out. - Yeah. Thank you. - Yes, we will. - Yeah, you're welcome. - Yeah, thanks. So many snacks! Yeah, night-night. I'm going to eat you. I'm going to eat you. - Julie. - You're really walking fast. Jules, give me the key. Heads up! - What's happening? - I don't know. Weird. Give me the bag. Thanks, Jules. Hmm. Hey, Mags. Mags. - What? - Let's play a game. Huh? No. I'm not playing a game. I have to work. Come on. Just play while you type, come on! Jules, I'm not playing a game. I want to get this done, and I want to go to bed. Eat something. Eat this. Come on, let's play. What game? Truth or dare. What? Are we 11? I pick... truth. Truth. Okay, well, ah... when I was dating Simon... did you have a crush on him? That was, like, 15 years ago. Okay. He was English, and he was cute. And he was really funny, and I had very slight crush on him. Whatever! I thought you did. Okay. Truth or dare? Um, truth. Okay. Are you having fun? I mean, what's fun? Yeah, I'm having fun. Okay. Dare. Um... I don't know. Lick the lampshade. Oh! Oh. Ugh. Okay. Ugh. Gross. Okay. Truth or dare? Dare? Wait, what did I say? Truth. I'm meant to say truth. - Truth, right? - It's too late. You said dare. - Truth. - You said dare. - Well, I mean to say truth. - You said dare! - Jules, I meant to say truth. - I dare you. Take off your shirt and run around the hotel, howling like a wolf. No. I have to work. - I don't have time to do that, so. - You said dare. You said it. Do it! Don't be a pussy, Mags. Take it off, take it off. Take off your shirt. - I'm going to film it. - Don't you dare! Don't you dare film the dare. If you do, just don't. Don't. Mags, the 1950s called. They want their underwear back. Shut up, Jules. I like my shape wear. You're going to get so many hot guys with that. Like I do anyway. What if I go out there and the owner sees me? Come on, do the dare. Jules. Open the door. Julie, this isn't funny, open the door. I can't. It's not funny. Jules, open the door. - Jules. Open it. - Mags. I'm not trying to be funny. This door won't open. - What? - I can't open it, try the other side. Okay. Jules, it's not opening. Ah! Jules, frick. The owner's gone. Her car is gone. God damn it! Come on, Jules! Okay. Okay, I have an idea. I'll call a locksmith. No, ah, I'll call the cops. Okay, call the cops. No. Mags, there's no reception. What? Okay, I have Wi-Fi so I can still email your work. Mags, try the door again. All right, oh, this is bad luck! Try the door again. My life... is constant bad luck lately. Mags, Mags, the window's bolted shut. Hey, Mags? - Yeah. - Are you okay? Can you email that last file? Yeah. - I did it. - I feel like the universe is trying to tell me something. Are you okay? Hey, Mags? Yeah. I got... I got to tell you something. What? I had another miscarriage. Shit. Jules, when? Like, six months ago? Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I never see you. And when I do, you're always working, and... that's just not something that you talk about at a coffee shop. I'm so sorry. Isn't that like the... The... the third time. We stopped trying. It's... it's just not in the cards for us. I love you, Jules. What? I said I love you. I know. I just... wanted to hear you say it again. Morning. Hm? Good morning? Huh? Did you girls have a fight? What? Did you two have a fight... a couple's fight? What? No! We're not lesbians. We're best friends! The door is stuck. What the hell? Oh, ow. Okay. The door is open. Oh, my God. Oh, by the way, Jack Junior is coming by soon to pick you both up to help you get your tire fixed. Yeah, bingo sucked, eww. It looks like you guys had, ah, fun, though. So... Hello? Hey, um. Sorry, we... we had a wild night. Yeah. It looks like it. I'll give you guys a minute. Oh, okay. Thank you! Thanks. Mags. Hey, Mags. - Come on, come on. We got to hurry. - What? - Hey, come on. - Okay. You can sleep in the car. I will drive, okay? You know, I got, like, some coffee and some bagels in here in case you want to any. I know, ah, June mentioned you didn't really eat anything for dinner, so. People like you are the reason I love getting out of the city. So, ah, where's your car? Uhm, it's like ten miles that way? No, um, no, it's ten miles... that way, I think. - Okay. Okay, well. - Yeah, yeah. It's that way. We'll find it. We'll find it. Jack, you're the best. You just made my day! I'm... I'm glad to hear it. - I'm super glad to hear it. - Yeah. Yeah, that was fun. Hoah! It's this one. It's this one. Jack, thank you so much. I really appreciate everything you did. How much do we owe you? Well... for the ride... coffee... and the SUV tire, I'm going to guess you owe me right around like... $500. Excuse me? Doesn't that seem a little steep? Woah, chill. It costs what it costs. I don't know what to tell you. Like... I mean, I had to travel to the motel, and that's like... that's like... thirty miles? I'm disappointed in you. Jack. I'm disappointed in you, Junior. Okay, I'm starting to think I should take back all the nice things I said about you but... Well... I sure hope you ladies get to where you're going safely. That was expensive, right? I mean, he's such a nice guy. A nice guy? He took advantage. That bagel that you ate cost you $300. Can you pull over? Can you pull over here for a second? - We have service. - Okay. Hi. Ah, finally! The queen answers her phone. Yeah, sorry. Um, where we've been the service has been really bad. Did you get those proposals last night? Yeah, I got them. They came in really late. Told you I needed them by ten. Had to wake up early this morning and do the corrections. Now, listen! I know you got a couple things going on, but you also got a job to do. If you're not up to the task, you got to let me know. I got like a mile of girls who would kill to have your position. Where I'm headed, um, service should be much better. Look, if you're going through some midlife, I-should've-had-a-baby crisis, I get it. But let me give it to you real straight, then I got to go. You mess up one more time, and you're out of here. Comprende? I'm... I'm not midlife, sir. But I guess that depends on how long I'm going to live. I don't have time for bullshit or lady problems or people dying. I got to go. Fore! Okay. You okay? I'm fine. - Mags, Mags. Look at the hitchhiker. - Hm? - Hm? - We're going to help him. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'd just heard about this thing where somebody's asking for help, and then you pull over. And then, these traffickers jump out of the bushes, and they kidnap you. - Mags, you're watching too much news. - Don't do it. - Jules, don't do it. - Look at her. I got to help her. Jules. I just want to go to the cabin. I'm not leaving her. Can you roll your window down? - Hi, hey. Where you headed? - I need to find a bus station. Okay, hop in. - Can you unlock your door? - Fine. Hey. This is... this is amazing. Thank you for stopping. No one was stopping. - I've literally been out here, like, three hours. - Wow. This is Mags. We're going to our cabin up north. Great. - What's going on? - I got to pee. What? Here? No, in those woods over there. - That's private property. - Okay... - I have to also. - It's not a big deal. - I really have to pee. - Okay. Mags! Maggie! Mags, no! Mags! Oh, my God. Get off my land! No one pees on my land! Mags! Mags! Go! He has a gun! Go! - What the hell? - Go! - Go! - Where's Alyssa? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my God. - You okay? - Yeah. Shit! - Alyssa's gone. She stole my purse. - What? - Alyssa's stole my shit and took off. - How? I fell asleep for, like, a second - while the two of you were supposed to be peeing. - Oh. We'll she's, ah, she's got to be around here somewhere, okay? - We'll just... we'll look for her. - Okay, okay. I almost got shot. I know. I told you it was private land. I know. I know, you're right. - You always know everything. - Yeah! I do. I know things. - I'm smart. - You are. Do you think she went this way? - I... - That way? I don't... I don't know. Maybe she... Do we have to turn around? I don't want to turn around. - I... well, I don't want to... - I don't want to go back. I don't want to go back. - But I need my purse! - I know you need your purse! - Oh, my God! - Let's calm down! We'll focus, and we'll find her. Okay. - Okay. - I think we have to turn around. Maybe if we go from the other direction. - Maybe he won't see us. - Maybe she's just out there. - Okay, let's look. Okay, you look over there. - A-huh. - I'll look here. - Okay. Okay. - How long was I out? - I don't know. How long... it depends on how long I was out. If I was out a long time, she could have gotten pretty far. No, I don't think she went very far. She had some pee anxiety. - Is that her? Is that her? - Where? - You see the backpack? - I see the backpack. - You see? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, my God. Okay. - Jules, that might be her. - Is that her? - Let me see. - Yeah, there she is. Okay. So, what's the plan? - What, what's the plan? Uh, ah, I'll come from the left. You come from the right, and we'll get her. - Okay. You ready? - Okay. - Ready? Let's go. - Sshhh, be quiet. Where is my friend's stuff? - It's in my bag. - Where? Why did you take it? - Because! - Because of why? I need the money. I don't have any money. - Ah! You... - I don't have any money. You thief! That was not cool. I need... I need money. I left home, and I need money to get back home. Come on, come on. It's okay. Don't console her. - Can't you see... She's desperate. - She's a thief! I don't care. Let's take her to the police station... citizen's arrest. Don't you think that that is a bit extreme, Maggie? She gave you your stuff back, okay? It's just stuff. Stuff? It's my stuff. If she wants stuff, she needs to go get her own stuff. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm trying to get back to Saint Paul. My mom lives there. Hey. - What's your story, Alyssa? - Oh. I went away a year ago... And I fell for this guy, but he was bad. And... and then I got stuck in Chicago. And... I made it this far. - A real story? - Yeah, I swear. - She's lying. - No, I'm not! I'm just... I'm trying to get back home. - How old are you? - Sixteen. Sixteen? Listen, I'm going to get you a bus ticket... and we're going to take you to the bus station. What? Really? Of course, are you kidding? We're going to call your mom, too. She's just a kid. Fine. But you shouldn't steal. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Horrible habit. Okay. - Now we go to the cabin. - Finally. All right. Mags, is it... - Is it there? - I don't know. What's the map say? I, there... this... GPS doesn't go here. Ah, there's, like, a little sign. Maybe that sign? Yeah. Oh, oh. - Here. - Yeah. Ha. - This is game farming. - Game farming. Okay, interesting. Yeah, this is like... rustic. Overgrown, right? Hashtag authentic. Yeah, that's... I mean, I... I'd have to do some gardening. This is nice. Wow. Mags, Mags, look at the butterfly! - Do you see it? - Yeah. Um... I think my mom said there was a hide-a-key somewhere near the front door. Do you think it has electricity? I don't know. I... I didn't even think about that. Hello? Yeah. What? No, yes. Uh, what? I, oh, I have to go. I have to go. I have to go back to the main road. - There was better service there. - Okay. - I'll be... I'll be back. - Okay. I'll start cleaning. Where are you? Why have you not returned my texts? There has been no communication. You're incompetent, and you don't return texts or emails or calls, or voicemails! No! No! Not cool! Not cool. - Did you get those proposals? - They're late. Yeah, I know. I know they were late. I know. - You're incompetent. - I get it. I'm... I'm doing the best I can here. - Tomorrow, I want to take the day. - The day? - You can't... - No, I'm not going to be available tomorrow. I'm going to take the day. I'm taking the day off. I'm going to do it. - I understand that you're not happy with it. I get it. - No! I get it. Julie? Hello? Julie? Do not jump out and scare me. Julie? Julie! Julie! I... I got to quit the hardware store, George. I got to. I just don't like the direction the company is taking. But you get such a good discount. I do, but they're selling toys now. Hi! I... I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm just gathering wood. - Oh, no problem. Uh... - Yeah. But where did you come from? Yeah, we camp out here all the time. We never run into anyone. Oh, um, my friend has a cabin up that way. - Oh, no way. - Well, I mean, I'm George, and this is my friend James. Hi, I'm Julie. Okay, well, have fun. Yeah. We definitely will, yeah. You know, definitely. Well, um, if you all feel like joining us later, we'll be having a really fun time. Getting our own personal rave going on out here. Roasting marshmallows, drinking a few cold beers. - Have brewskis. - Something like that, yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah. Got to go. - Bye. - Bye. Oh! Get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off! - I don't think it's on you. - It's on me. Is it on me? - It's there. - No, no. You're fine. You have the lights on. Yeah. Lights, but no toilet, no running water, really nasty outhouse. Well, I met some campers in the woods, and they invited us to roast marshmallows. Weird. What'd you say? Um, I said yeah. They seemed nice. No, no. I'm going to bed. No. By the way, why does it smell like death in here? Because... it does. - Jules. - Hm? What are you doing? - This is where I found the carcass. - Human? No, I wouldn't be here if I found a dead body in here. Gross! Burn it! Burn everything. There's no reception. Jules... - please go to bed. - I'm not... I'm not tired. That's because you slept on a bed last night. Please just go to bed. Okay. You go to bed... and I'm going to read. I will be so quiet. I'll be very, very quiet. Mags? What? I want to tell you something. Mags! What? Jules, what? What is happening? Um... I'm sorry that this trip hasn't gone very well. Yeah, yep. We've barely hung out in six years. Really, it's been that long, huh? I'm really... I'm really sorry about... you and Devin, what you guys are going through. It sucks. We'll be good. I'm more worried about you. Me? No. No, tomorrow is a new day. Yeah. I... I want to go to the castle. I love you, Tris. Hey, Mags. - What are you doing? - Sshhh. Jules, what is happening? - It's probably just animals, or racoons or something. - Sshhh! It is not animals. - They are talking. - They're talking? Would I be holding this if I didn't hear talking? Yes, you would. - Okay. - Let's... No, there's no reception. Does your grandpa have a shotgun? I don't know if he has a shotgun. Okay, well, find something. What are you talking about? Find a weapon. You go. I go? - Should we just- - Sshhh! - Should we just answer it? - I don't know. Oh, shit. Who is it? It's the campers. - The campers? - It's the campers. What are you talking about, the campers? The guys in the woods. That's weird. Did you hear the sirens? Excuse me? The sirens and the lights. You know, at first, I thought it was... aliens. But then, it went away. What happened? I thought you were going to come join us? Um, I, ah, I had to sleep. Oh, well. We... we have some great music playing. And... and there's a bonfire going. They're coming! Oh! Who's... who's coming? You have to hide, man! Get out of the light. - Oh! - He says they're coming. What? He says they're coming. But, like... they're high. They're, like, super high. Is that what this is? Dude, it's safe under the light. The ladies will protect us. - Huh! - You'll protect us, right? Um... Ah, yeah, yeah, guys. You're all safe. Everything's going to be fine. You just need to go back to your camp site. Drink a lot of water. Okay? Oh, so you're a protector. Oh, that's so lovely. - You're so lovely. - No, no. Don't do that. - Don't do that. - They're all over me, man! They're over me, man! What the fuck! What, what! No, no, no! No, no. I don't... I don't want what you have. Get them... get them... get them off of me! Get them off of me! Get them! What! They're aliens. Stop it, aliens. Stop it! Stop it! No, no! They're in my pants. They're in my... Leave me alone! Why? Why? We need to help them. No, I want to go to bed. No, no, no! You need to drink these. You need to go back to your camp site. You need to drink a lot of water, okay? You just need water. - Thank you so much, protector. - Yeah, you're so welcome. I got something I got to say to you. I love your daughter, log. And we're going to get married whether you like it or not! They're literally going to be eaten alive out there. Why, that's fine. Like, they've done tons of drugs and, or LSD or ecstasy, I don't know. Or something really hard core, especially that one. I can't leave them outside. - I just... - I'm a lost boy in the woods. - I think it's so good we never did drugs, you know. - Yeah. George! - I'm just going to help him back to his camp. - No, what's the point? - It's like herding cats, Jules. - No, no, no, no. Until they come down from it, there's nothing that you can do. Jules, there's no point. They have to come down from the high. There's nothing that you can do. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, buddy. - Come here. - Jules. - Come here. You have to let them come down from it. - He's not going to come to you. - Now we're going to be eaten! Damn it! Hey. Hey, I love you. I have love for you in my heart. I have love, peace and blessings to you, buddy. - That will help. - Ssshhh. I love you, buddy. I got the matches buddy for you. Take that! Take that! Oh, my God! - Okay. I'm calling the cops. - You're safe, George. You're safe, buddy. I've got you. - Okay, all right. - Yeah. Okay, guys. You're done. It's all done. I'm going to go up the road so I can call them. - Yeah, good idea. - Hey, I'm coming inside. Let me in. - Can I come in? Aw! - No! George, I'm hit! I'm hit, George, George, George, George. George, buddy. Get a medic! - Get a medic! - Get out! Go! It hurts! I don't want... I don't want to be like this anymore, George. I don't want to be like this. - Please, make it stop. - It's okay. It's all okay. Can you just make it stop? I just... make it stop. Go. You just go. You just go back to your camp. I just want to go to bed. My face is wet from the water, not from my tears. I just want to go to bed. No, I'm just an animal now. I just live here in the woods with the other animals. That's what I... I'm just rotten. I'm just a filthy animal. I didn't mean it. I don't want to go to hell. I don't want to go space. I'm sure glad you called. No telling what might have happened. Well, I need to go check their campsite. Where did you say it was? Ah, it's at that ridge over there. I'm so glad that you came. I was starting to think that somebody was going to die. - Of stupidity, most likely. - Yeah. Well, you have a safe night. No, no, no, don't leave without me! Oh. Why are all your t-shirts rainbows, - butterflies and unicorns? - Are they? Hey, I thought that you were going to take the day off? So did I. And then I thought better of it. Hey, I found out why it's so stinky by the bed. Why? Mice, dead mice. Five under the bed... in the bed. Ugh. Gross. I don't get it, Jules. Why did my grandfather leave me a cabin that's old and stinky and gross with acid dropping campers nearby? I don't know, Mags. Like, maybe it's all he had to give you. You know... he thought you needed it or that you would... know how to bring life to it. You know, that's what you do. You come in and you make things beautiful. - No. - Yes! Look at your paintings. I want to go home. Hey, I have an idea. Let's do one fun thing before we go. - Jules, I think I've had enough fun for a whole year. - Okay. Let's just... we'll go for a hike, okay? We'll get some fresh air and... check out the scenery. Let's just do one fun thing before we go. - Okay? - Fine. But I want coffee and food first, okay? Yeah. All right. - We'll go that way, okay? - We're doing this. This is nice. Yeah. You know, you were right. We just needed to do one good thing before we left. - And I didn't bring my phone. - Hey, Mags? Yeah? Can I ask you a question? - Are you happy? - Um... honestly, I... I work so much, I don't really think about it. But you know me, I mean, I love working. I've always loved working. I just... I don't know, it's seems a little harder than it has to be, you know. Yeah, maybe it's because of who you work for? Hey, Mags. Do you see that? - What? - Over there. It's a little bunny. I think he's stuck. Mags, we got to help him. No, no, no more helping things. He's fine. He'll be fine. I'm sure he'll get out. He's on the other side of the bank. He'll be fine. No, I'm... I'm, I'm going to go help him. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to get stuck, and I'm not going to come in and save you from getting stuck. Mags, I'm going to go help him. - Jules, what are you doing? - I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I am not coming in there. You're stuck, aren't you? No, I'm fine. You're stuck, Jules! I don't want to come in the river. I'm fine! Mags, can you hurry? We... We're running out of time. Jules. Jules, I told you you'd get stuck. Now, I'm going to get stuck. Oh! Jules, let's go back to the cabin. I want to go home. Just after we save him. No. No. No, this is... this is irresponsibility. This is crap, Jules. Irresponsibility? Are you freaking kidding me? If it was up to you, nobody would ever be helped or... or anything. The only person that you care about is your horrible insensitive, perverted boss! I care about everyone and everything. No. No, Mags. No, you don't. Ever since you started working for him, you've changed. You're really different. You're just a... - What? - Nothing. What, Jules? You're a horrible bitch! You're angry all the time, and you don't laugh anymore. - And you're always... - you're stressed out! You're a completely different person! I am not! That's ridiculous! Yeah? Because I don't want to wander into some random river and save some stupid animal that decided to get stuck does not mean I'm a horrible person. You want to save everyone, Jules. The whole freaking world. Well, it doesn't work like that. Sometimes, people need to buckle down, and they need to get shit done. And they need to help themselves. That's him talking. That's not you! Him? Your boss! Don't you see ever since you started working with him, you're life's been a total shit show. And now, you're just this insensitive bitch that doesn't even like anyone! You don't even like yourself. Fine. I never should have done this trip with you. Thanks for telling me what you really think. No, you don't get off like that! I am right, and you know that I'm right! That's why you're so mad because it's the truth. Wake up, Mags! No! No! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Jules. Jules. Jules. You're right. You're right. I've been a miserable bitch. I worked so hard for six years. I'm not married. And... I'm so stressed out all the time. And I don't even have any kids. And I don't even want any kids! You know what... - let's go save him. - Okay. Let's go save this animal. Okay? Okay. - Come on. Come on. - Okay. Hurry up! Come on! Come on, Maggie. Maggie, let's go. Step on it. Gerald, hi! Hey. Hi, Gerald! - Maggie and Allen. - We're here. Oh. Your wife called. So? I hope you're working late tonight to make up for this weekend. Yeah, I am. Don't forget to lock up. I always do. Oh, ah, I forgot about this one. I need you to read it tonight and brief me on it in the morning, okay? Hey. It's really nice to see you working so hard. We missed you around here. Can't afford to have you taking that much time off, okay? Keep working. Ugh. No, no, no, no. No! No! No! So, as I was saying, I think we definitely need to invest in marketing in that area. Why? Well, because the market... is not being targeted in that area. What area? Well, Boston. Yeah. You already target Boston? Yeah, I know that. That's because... When I say Boston, I mean the entire Eastern seaboard. See, your public is... currently residing all up and down the coast, and nobody's targeting them correctly. Right, people aren't doing their job. Um, so what I would say is we'll get you a proposal tomorrow. Sound good? Right, good. Well, thanks. We're going to get you that right away tomorrow, first thing. All right, buddy. All right, buddy. Okay! You're the man now, okay. Well... this can't happen. Okay? This can't happen! You know why? Because this doesn't happen. That didn't happen. And soon, you won't be happening. Right? Why? Incompetence, that's a good reason why. But before incompetence, I will go to where were you? Where have you been? You don't answer your phone! You don't return my texts. What do you need me to send you a trolley? You need me to send a telegram to you? What does it take to get through to you? I'm on a call with the biggest CFO in the freaking Eastern coast and nobody is here to give me the notes that I asked for last night! Where were... just get out of here. Get out! Go to your little desk because you obviously don't have what it takes to make it to the big office! You know... I can't even tell you what was going through my mind. I can't do this. People are incompetent. No company lunches... Pay for your guys' phones. You don't answer them. God damn it! Make me sound incompetent. You're crazy. You are... I can't rely on anybody... except myself. What the hell? Stop calling. Oh, my gosh. No! - Can I get you anything? - No. - Water? - No. I just... I'm here. I'm going to say something. Then I'm going to go. Okay. Okay, this isn't easy for me. We've... I've always felt like we've been such good friends and, like, I can tell you anything, like, you can tell me anything. And sometimes, I got to let you figure things out, just like you do with me. - Yeah, right. - Okay. Do you remember when I dated that guy, Jeff? - Yeah. That was, like, ten years ago. - Yeah. I was, like, young and naive and... When I was with him, I was sick all the time. Like, I always had a cold or the flu, do you remember? Yeah. Okay, do you remember when I had that car accident? Of course, yeah. So right before I got in that car accident... Jeff and I got in a horrible fight. Like, he said some things to me that were really... cruel. Like, he was bad. Like, I could have died. I know. Okay, well... after the car accident, I realized that every time these things happened, it was always after I had had a conversation with Jeff or been around Jeff or been on the phone with him. It was him. It wasn't me. It was... him or me with somebody like him. Okay. You have been with this boss for six years, and ever since you've been with him, literally, one, two weeks into it, you started to change like you became unhappy and distracted. Do you remember when you cut your hand? Sure. You had just had a phone conversation with him where he told you that you messed up a project so badly that he actually wondered if you were retarded. - He said that? - Yeah. Mags, he says stuff like that to you all the time. - He does? - Yes, and you just take it. I have never heard you stand up for yourself or defend your work or anything. Okay, so my point is... is that your boss is to you what Jeff was to me... bad. And if we're going to keep being friends, I need you to fix it. I need you to handle it. I know. I know. Jules. Yeah. You were right. You're right. I've been a miserable cow, and I'm, uh, I think I'm going to quit. Hey, um... I have an idea. I'll... I'll drive you for moral support. Okay, good, yeah. I'll, um, I'll meet you outside. Okay. So, are you ready? - I think so. - What are you going to say? I'm going to tell him that I quit. That I'm done. - Okay. - What? I just think that you should tell them how you really feel. - I'm proud of you. - Well, I mean, I haven't done it yet, and I'm sweating like a pig. And I didn't sleep at all last night. So... Hey, you're going to do great. I'm right here. I'm your getaway car. Mags, don't cry. All right. Okay. Why are you dressed so casual? Is it casual Friday? No. What's going on? Are you on your period or something? No. I just... I wanted... You got the Harris proposal, right? Yeah, sure. Great. Are you okay? Yeah, totally. Totally, I'm great. Okay. How'd it go? - Great. - What happened? Um, well, I... - I don't know. - Maggie! - What the hell? - I tried. I just... I couldn't do it. And... and, you know what? I can send it in an email. - It will be easier. - I knew it. That's it. We'll have to talk about it. Hi, there. I... I'm going to have to... I'm sorry. I'm going to have to call you back. Hi. Mags here has something she would like to tell you. And who are you? You don't want to know. Mags? Mags would like to tell you that she's quitting. Right, Mags? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I, um, I'm done. I've decided to quit. So I'm quitting. And she would also like to tell you that you are a very horrible person, a very mean boss and that you should work on that. Right, Mags? Yeah. Yes. You need to work on your people skills. Yeah. What goes around comes around. And you have a very bad vibes, man. Okay. Mags also wants to tell you some other things. What... What? I don't know, it's just... yeah, that's it. Yeah, I quit. I'm good. I... that's... that's it. Wow. So, you needed to bring in your lesbian friend to help you with this? Yeah, you know, see that's what he does. He sort of... I don't know, makes those little jabs to make someone feel like a little piece of... you know what. You know what? You're the piece of you know what. You're horrible. You're horrible! You're horrible to the women in this office. You... you... you treat your wife like crap, and she's like the sweetest, most beautiful person. God! You know, and I hate this plant. - I hate it. - She hates it. I hate it so much. I'm so sick of looking at that stupid plant. And I'm so... I don't know, like, I just wish people like you would be put away so you can't infect the world with your cruelty and your sarcasm. - And I deserved a promotion. - She deserved a promotion. I did. I worked nights, I work weekends. I barely saw my friends. And you... you didn't even let me go see my grandfather... when he was in hospice. You are so fired. I quit first. I quit... first, asshole! Don't you get it? What is wrong with you? Oh, my God. And I don't even care that there's, like, a million women who are waiting in the wings to take my job. And I wish I could go on the nightly news and talk about what a sleaze bag you are, and maybe, I don't know. Maybe I should do that. And maybe I should tell your wife all of the... horrible things that you've done that she doesn't know about. You threatening me? I'll call the cops. No. No. You don't get to do that. I think it's called... blackmail. I know so much about you. You have no idea what I know. I think he knows. What do you know? Everything. I'll put it all over social media. Every girl you screwed on a work vacation. Every client you destroyed when you got off the... what are you doing? Stop it. Every client you destroyed when you got off the phone with them. How about all the money you stole from the company that the accountant doesn't even know about? I could destroy you... stop it, Jules. I'm not done. - You're not... you're done. - All of it. I could destroy you and your company in one day, man. I'm serious. One day. I see you! Jules, I'm not done. - You're done. - I have more to say to him. Why are you pulling me? I can see you. I see you in there. Your smog, horrible face. I hate that face. I hate it! Jules! Jules? Oh, guys. You hear me? You don't put up with any bullshit from him, okay? You call Mr. Levine, he's an amazing attorney. His number's 1-800-444-HELP! Show's over. Go back to work. What? - That was... - So good! I mean, that was so good. - That felt so good. - I don't think you needed to blackmail him. Well, you know, I mean that just came out in the heat of the moment. I mean... - I get it. - Yeah. Ah, I should do that more often, right? Mr. Peters told me to tell you to not forget to send the Johnson report in. Tell Mister Peters to go fuck himself. He also said that your laptop is company property. Holy shit, this guy! - Yeah, he is... - Such a... Oh, my... Woah! I keep expecting the... cops - to, like, knock at my door. - They won't. You did it. You went in there and... stood up for yourself. I did. Didn't I? I kind of sunk to his level though. What? I just... keep thinking about when you knocked that plant over. That was so stupid. Oh, my God. Now what, Jules? Whatever you want. The world's yours. I got to go. We exploded it. Yeah, girl. This is good. - It's not done. - Yeah, but it's good. I'm here... whatever you need. I know. I love you, Jules. Love you back. That would be great. Yeah, thank you. Hello! - Hello! - You're here! - It is going so well. - I know. It's pretty awesome, isn't it? I've already sold half of my paintings. - I mean, of course, you have. Look at it. - Oh, no. You're so sweet. - Oh, you see that one over there? - Yeah. Nobody's buying it which is kind of the point. I put sold sticker on it, because I wanted to give it to you. - Want to go see it? Okay. - Yes! - To Maggie, the most badass girl that we know. - Aw. To Maggie, here's to defeating evil - before it kills you. - Oh. Well, thank you. Cheers to all of us. And of course, this party is, of course, for this which is very exciting. But also, because I decided to put you both on the deed of the cabin. - So this cabin is half yours. - You did what? It took a lot to get him here. Yeah. Hey! - No, Maggie. I invited them. - Why? Everyone deserves a second chance, Maggie. Even them? - Even you. - Oh, even me? All right. We're clean, all right? - I promise. - All right. Yeah, all right! Okay. All right. Hey. Thank you!
