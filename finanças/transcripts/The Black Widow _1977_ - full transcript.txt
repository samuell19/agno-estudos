Matea must be punished Matea must be punished! Matea must be punished Matea must be punished! What on earth are you doing! - Hail purest Mary - Conceived without sin! Matea must be punished. Matea must be punished. - Hail purest Mary - Conceived without sin! Matea must be punished. Matea must be punished. Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses... Is the parish door that way? Thank you. Nice behind! Ain't it? Mr. Priest, I'm Matea Gutiérrez, at your service. The bishop sent me. The housekeeper. What a way to meet you. I don't know what you think of me. But whatever it is, it's true. My medicine! Give me those pills on the napkin. Wash your hands. I'll help you. I'm sorry about the mess. But ever since Dona Luz left... What a great housekeeper! This is like the government, they carry away the very best. She works for the archbishop now. I haven't had the time to fix this up. And besides, this is a woman's job. Come with me. The birds! They come in when I open up. Must be the heat, I don't know. The sheets must be over there. Settle in. The bishop sends this. Well, tell me if you want me to start putting things in order, Mr. Priest. Look, Matea, the name's Feliciano. And the whole town calls me Father Feliz - "Happy". For short. Settle yourself in. Holy Ghost, light the way. Save me and defend me as if I were your own. Vanquish and you'll vanquish... And keep me from my enemies. I'm settled in, Father. The bishop holds you in high regards. Yes, he knows me since I was a girl. He'd come to see us often in Ures. I was a housekeeper there for ten years. With Father Cornídez. Father Cornídez, such a good man... Very witty... but he died some two months back. Then Monsignor did me the favor of recommending me to you. Father Cornídez! May God bless his soul. - He was pretty old. - Yes, very old. Over 90 years old. He wasn't a priest. He was one of the twelve apostles! Forgive me, Mate. I didn't mean to offend his memory. Never mind. I found some shoes and a belt and a shirt that I'm going to fix, it's still good. Excuse me, Father, at what time do you usually take your meal? Well... about two in the afternoon Look, Matea, over there in the cupboard; there are some jars with tea. Linden, peppermint, chamomile tea. I drink them instead of water. Yes, sir. - I'll get to work. - Yes, Matea, the house is a mess. - Excuse me. - Yes, come in, Matea. - Your chilaquiles, Father. - That's a lot of food. - Who know what you might think. - I think nothing at all. Solitude whets your appetite. Sit down, Matea. - With you? - Yes, why not? - Out of respect. - Sit down! I want to talk to someone. That Father Cornídez had a good appetite. He must have overdosed on your stews! It was fifteen or twenty years ago... I only saw him once. He was good man. Tell me about him. He was a saint. He'd go up the mountain to the Indians; to cure them. He'd go on a donkey and spend up to three weeks before coming back. Full of herbs and medicines. Rather like a missionary. I heard a story about him. It was an All Saints Day... the mass... sermon time.. There were very few people. And the say Father Cornídez blurted out: "Nobody here!" "All the old hags are mourning their stinking dead!" You know, you are young and pretty. You'd look better if you'd smile. Alas, Matea! Nothing wrong with me telling you this. Do you see? If you'll excuse me, Mr. Priest. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world... We cannot walk hungry under the sun. Always give us the same bread, Your Body and Blood, Lord. We cannot walk hungry under the sun. Always give us the same bread, Your Body and Blood, Lord. Good morning, Father, it's a pleasure. - Very nice chorus. - Yes, very nice. - Good morning, Father. - Our new housekeeper. Don Cosme, our protector. - His wife. - Pleased to meet you. Don't flatter me. - Congratulations. - Excuse me. The City Hall President. His wife and his daughter. - She's Matea. - Welcome to our town. - Thank you. - Excuse me. A gorgeous mass, Father Feliz. Thank you, Ursula. You say the same thing every Sunday. The new parish house housekeeper. Miss Ursula Díaz. President of "Mary's Daughters". And a Lady of the "Perpetual Candle". Doctor! What happened with you? You didn't come to the domino game. It's just that... I was ill. Father, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm Dr. Leonardo Saldívar, at your service. Though it looks like... you don't need a doctor. Wouldn't you like to come to the house for refreshments? - Sure. - Let's go! Nice meeting you.. Hi, Matea. Doctor! Bye, Matea. How were the chilies, Father? Tasty, Matea. Just one thing, Father. You need a new cassock. Why? I have two. Yes, but both are frayed and tattered. Have a look. Priests get neither luxuries nor shoe strings. You haven't seen the Holy Pope. Meh. He's the pope. I'm just a provincial priest... who has to break his back so that he can have his fancy clothes. Mother of God, don't talk like that! I know I blaspheme. But remember how humble Christ and the Apostles were. - Barefoot, with sandals, a tunic. - They were different times. - Come this way, Matea. - Yes, sir. Sit down. Let's think of this. There are a lot of priests in the world, let alone nuns. And the truth is that we are Creation's most useless people. Good for nothing! We live on alms, stick our noses into what's none of our business, when we should be working for the poor. We should be missionaries and really useful for something. Oh, Father! I can't understand how, if you have those ideas, you've nevertheless managed to be respected by such a conservative town. Because I fool them. I tell them what they want to hear. So? Will you buy a new cassock? Fine. I'll order one from Querétaro. The tailor knows my size. Order a larger one. That one is too tight. Must be the fabric that shrinks when washed. Have a look. Do you like it? Fine. Excuse me. Pardon, Father, but the doors were open. The doors are always open. I need to talk to you. Privately. Right, Ursula, tell me. What's up? I don't know... It's stronger than me. Stronger than me. Father... I need to see you! Your business can be discussed at the confessional. I don't want to see another church. Ursula, you don't know what you're saying. It's too much. I can't sleep at night. Perhaps you'll sleep in hell. I only think of you. Ursula, that's enough provoking and baiting. Am I not woman enough for you? Neither you nor anyone else. I'm no saint, but I'm not a sinner. Get out. I'll see in you in church. You can't spurn a woman this way. And you can't provoke a priest this way. Dear Camagüey, I'm leaving for... Fours! Double that! How can you play fours when I started? But you passed. And I'll do it again. Hold on. The rules say no comments are allowed. Just two play at a time! Nobody on? Well, a pass is a pass. - Pass. - Wounded for you! Pass. - Can't hear you, dear Father. - Pass, fuck! - Dont get angry, Father. - No mercy on the enemy! I'm in with this, this... and I close up. Dog house for you! - Forgive me, dear Father. - We'll meet again on my grounds. Don't leave without paying my thirty pesos. Nothing can be done now, padre. No, doctor. It's not important, just a game. But he did play dirty on me. Darn it, Father. I forgive him here. That old man... I'm a bad loser, but he's a worse winner. Wait a moment. We'll leave together. What's that, Father? I've got a headache. I've told you not to take any medicine I didn't prescribe. You don't know what you're taking. Father, I wanted to ask you something. - What about? - About Matea. Sh...she's... a... good... woman... sweet... and very pretty. She is. I... I'm a single man that... I'm thinking... well, you know... of settling down... - Are you about to ask me for her hand? - No! I just wanted your approval to ask her out. With all due respect, of course, like a good Christian. Doctor, the Church can't get involved in certain things. But... I'll give you a hand. Thank you, Father. But, there's a catch. What's that? Don't ever play fours with me again! Go out with him, Matea. Try it, he's a good catch. No, Father. I'm engaged in more important tasks. I don't like the life out there. Besides, marriages doomed, they don't work out. How do you know? You've never been married. But I've seen the couples that come to get married. They look so happy and contented. A while later they come to you for help. They want to split up, they want to get divorced. Kids... no way, Father. But it's God's will, it's written in the Holy Book. Christ never got married. But you're not Christ, you're Matea Gutiérrez. - See him. - No, Father! Do it as a favor. I'm fine just here. Do it for me! - What is it, Father? Want me to leave? - No, Matea. I just want a free doctor. Doctor? Father Feliciano sent me. He says you know what it's about. Right... yes. Good thing you came for his medicine. On his own he buys some weird stuff. He goes to drug stores as if they were book stores! To check out what's new! Is he ill? He has a fragile health. He's fine if he takes care of himself. He's full of obsessions. He's just too alone. By the way, Father F. gave me permission to take you out for a stroll. Well... Just look at your hands! Have a seat. Your skin is damaged. It's good to have you with us. You'll come to like the town. It's very quiet. People get along well... Everything's in order. Have you seen the surroundings? They're sensitive and solitary beings. When they make love... the male, who is always the weaker one, does a flirtatious dance. So he dances and dances, coming closer to the female, who looks at him with diminishing indifference. Then he takes her, and they remain that way for a while. Enjoying their pleasure. In the end, the female devours the male. - Really? - Yes, nature can be ruthless. No ethics or morals. You either kill... or get killed. No! What are you doing? Let go of me! No! No! Holy Ghost light the way. Save me and defend me as if I were your own. Vanquish and you'll vanquish... And keep me from my enemies. Help me. Matea! Open up, Matea. What's wrong? Why are you crying? Tell me, Matea. - The doctor. - What happened? He touched me. And I had done nothing. Then... I got frightened and started screaming. - What happened? - He left... I feel really bad, Father. It's a sin. But it's not your sin. It's his. And I'm to blame. What should I do, Father? Forget about it. Try to forget it. Are you all right? Yes, I'm all right, Father. But I feel really bad. Have some rest, Matea. Have some rest. I won't be dating her again. I thought she was a worthy, decent woman. She's not worth it. It's living next to temptation. And men are weak. - Trouble ahead. - How do you know? They're coming together. There will be trouble. Bring the incense. We've been talking, Father. Friends, your friends. People you know. What is it? You know we always try to solve our problems together. So, every time a problem comes up... we at least try to solve it within the community... and we're not ashamed of talking it over with you as we know you're reasonable... and understanding. There's a problem that... There's a problem that affects us all. - Rumors, Father. That's it. It's a small town and rumors run wild... And besides, we, like yourself, have always carried ourselves transparently. And, as I'm sure you'll understand, this gossip really concerns us. Gossip that you've all parroted. Indeed, Father, nobody's free from the gossip sin. And besides, it's really difficult to talk about it if she's present. Wait, Matea. - Do the rumors concern her? - I'm afraid they do. Then she's staying! People should be attacked head-on. All this is bad for my business. People stay away. Nobody wants to invest. The fact that this woman is living under your same roof is the sticking point. Look, Father, if this goes on, our town's going to hell! People! Matea's staying here. Because the accusations are unfounded! And we're innocent. And you! If you want to write to the Bishop, do it! - Of course I will. - So you can run me out of this town. Furthermore... You will not talk to me in that tone! Good afternoon! I'll never come to church again... We never expected something like this. Never! as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thank you. I'd better get out of town. No, Matea, it would mean agreeing with them. And they're wrong. My God! Isn't the priest coming today, either? No. You'll be confessed. No at Holy Hour nor at the Rosary. Perhaps at the first mass, but I can't say for sure. Excuse me. The parish house doors are always closed! - Father? - Yes, Matea? I want to confess myself. Wait until I get to the church. No, Father. It has to be now. - Hail purest Mary. - Conceived without sin. Father, I accuse myself of fornication. I'm in love, Father. And that's my whole life. At the beginning... it was out of sadness. Out of loneliness. But then, little by little it became something else. It became giving him, granting him... Because you're so alone. Just because. I love you, Father. I love your hands... your face, your body. I love everything about you. I'm sorry to be telling you all this. Father. But that's the way it is. For good or bad. I know you feel the same way about me. You won't break free. You won't. It's too late. Because it's the two of us. And there's no turning back for our love. It's... it's as if we had killed someone. This is irreversible. I love you, Father. I love you. Father... I feel sick. - What is it, Father? - I don't know. I really love you, Matea. Then Jehovah... unleashed his rage and his fury... on Sodom and Gomorrah. And rained brimstone and fire... Destroying those cities... and all their sinners! People who were selfish, lazy... listless, arrogant and sodomites! And the land was made sterile... These sins that cry out for vengeance from Heaven, have overtaken you. And the wrath of God will fall on your heads! Shameful. So immoral! That woman put a spell on him. I'd say she's got him by something else. He doesn't seem to be the same man. She's wore him down. - What can we do? - Stop going to Mass. - I'll stop confessing. - Give them the silent treatment. Let them feel our rejection. We can't allow this to go any longer. We have to let the Bishop know. I'm sending a someone right away. Who else but you, Loving Savior So full of power So full of love Who else but you, to take away all evil Who washes away our sins I will spread the word. Hypocrites! They're worse than us. "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone." Pharisees! This is a town that stinks! Father! Doctor, Father Feliciano is very ill. Can you come and see him? Before you came to this town, everything was in order. Everything went fine. It was all fine, we were all at peace. As soon as you arrived, trouble started. Can't you see? Everything's a mess! So, until you pack your bags, I mean really pack your bags and leave... Count me out. Count me out too. I'm not asking you for a favor. You're a doctor, it's your obligation. Obligation! Right. It's six-four. Calm down! - But, doctor! - What? I want to see the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. I wait for the Father, the Son, and I wait for the Holy Ghost. Light for the two of us! Light for the two of us! Light for the two of us. My hope for the Father... Father St. Raphael! St. Michael! St. Gabriel! Come Archangel Saints! Archangel Saints! I beg of you to intervene! Save him, Lord. Save him, my Lord! For the health of Father Feliciano! O Father Almighty! - It's useless in such small pieces... - Look who's coming! Ladies, Father Feliciano needs help. More than you provide? You know he's a very sick man. Now he is gravely ill. You can't abandon him! God abandoned Adam and Eve, expelling them from Paradise. But... he's dying! One more sin for your conscience! Leave this town, and he might be saved. I can't leave, Dona Aurora. He needs me. He needs God's forgiveness. You've come to bewitch him. To poison him. Ladies... Ladies... Ladies... Ladies! Help us, please. Help us. Help him yourself by leaving. No, Aurora, this one's missing... Yes... Hand me that piece. God's wrath will fall upon this town! God's wrath has fallen upon you two! Get out! Bring me a glass of water. This woman has left my mouth dry. Killed in a hail of bullets. Eyes wide open looking at death. Why did you allow it, My Lord? And she helped out in the crime because he was her lover. Destroy them, My Lord! Destroy them. Do not forgive them! Don't forgive them. Save him, O Father! You can't be so cruel and treat him thus. Can't you see that he loves me? If you, with all your power, allowed him to love me... Then you're also to blame. Save him! Save him! Do you hear me? Save him! "Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis" "In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritu Sancti." Amen. I'm afraid, Hernán. It's all fine. The bells have not been rung for a long time. What's going on? Father Feliciano has died. You killed him! He died talking. During his agony he threw up all the garbage you fed him. All the confessions... All the sins. All the crimes. Women are not bound by the confession vow of secrecy. - So now I know you all. - You lie! Really? Want me to tell you what I know about you? You have no right to threaten us! Really? Even if I know about that evening at the boarding school? God shall be your judge! The souls of the damned shall burn forever in Hell! Juan. Juan! Come. You've got to help me, Juan. I'm all by myself. Yes, yes. Wait a moment. Be careful. Matea. I'm sorry to interrupt you here, but I need to speak to you. It's true, I committed adultery, but, I've already paid for my sin. Now I need to be sure of your silence. I'm prepared to give you money. You don't say. Yes... I'll pay whatever you want. Why not? You and your husband are very rich. You've sacrificed everything for power and fortune, right? I'll give you anything. But I need something else. Something that distresses me and won't let me sleep. I want to know all their secrets. Bare all the others' souls for me. My friends' souls, my relatives' souls! I need to know it all. Matea. Help me, Matea! Together, we can rule the town! Matea! Why did you do it? It's my land and it provides work for many peasants. They're marijuana fields that you planted, in collusion with this gentleman and the peasants, and which you later smuggle. Just you be careful, Matea. It's dangerous to know so much. Yeah, like with de delegate Gidal who wound up murdered, right? What are you talking about? About your wife's ex-husband. - Shut up! - Why? Nobody can hear us here. Only the saints and they can't talk. - But you can. - I can. - Are you threatening us? - No. No. We'll see who's stronger. Fools! Can't you see I have God's power? Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. Feliciano! Who is it? What do you want? The Bishop sends me to take charge of this parish. Father Feliciano is in charge of this parish. But I understand he's passed away. - And I took his place. - You? - Yes. This parish belongs to me. And I won't allow anyone to take my place. - You can stay as long as you like. - No! It is you who can't stay. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - They sent him... to destroy us! - It's the Bishop who sent me. Sometimes... I have visions. Welcome to the Lord's House. Come! Jehovah! You miserable wretch! Out with you! Cursed town that deserves divine punishment! Brimstone and fire will rain on your sinning heads! And all those parishioners' masks... of puritans and hypocrites! Show your bodies and all your body's shames! Be acquainted with this man... who sold his daughter to obtain a political position. The saintly girl who's aborted more than I can count. Helped by this doctor, who ran away from another town for selling drugs. And our very refined first lady... who committed adultery with her husband's best friend. Who's none other than the land owner, a speculator and a marihuana grower. And his most Catholic and devout wife! Who was a prostitute in the capital! We are all sinners! Even this honorable leader, who murdered his lover's husband in collusion with her! The caretaker of peasant social conscience! The irreproachable teacher, who gropes his female students! And raped a girl at the boarding school. Go on, Matea! And this man, who has stealthy intercourse with young boys. And the lay sister, who sleeps with everyone to quench her thirst for sex! Are you mad? Devils! You're made for each other. Monsters! subtitles: scalisto for KG
