Our children are the future of our nation. Thus, we must pay special attention to their physical and mental care. This is because, we think, children under a certain age are liable to influence, and without positive reinforcement, their development may become skewed. That is to say, when a child does not receive the proper love and care of a parent, it is possible that they may develop undesirable, even dangerous, tendencies towards their peers at school, and also to those around them. Indeed, without love and care from a parent, or protection from… protection against…? Aren't your eyes tired, staring at your cellphone all day? No. My phone has a screen-protector that stops eye-fatigue. So instead I have to get tired, staring at you on that all day. I'm on holiday anyway, Mom. The near becomes distant. The distant becomes near. Aren't you always on your gadgets for hours at work? Research shows that cellphone use leads to depression, eye-pain, and obesity. You're just saying that to frighten me, Dad. This is a child psychologist speaking, not me. Obesity? That's good, then. Better than being skinny, like a skeleton. Stop that, dear. Just finish your breakfast. Do you have time to eat with us? The kids are on holiday. I'm busy. I need to prepare my presentation for Friday. Is that still happening? Don't you want to be Mrs. Head Commissioner for the Safety of Children and Young People? As long as you don't work so hard you forget about us. Aw, man, looks like we won't go anywhere for the holidays this time… I promise you, I'll make time for a trip together. If only Grandma were here. She'd have taken us out. Grandma always took us out even when both of you were too busy. Come on, Ryan. Let's not talk about Grandma. She's in a better place now. I promise I'll take a day off soon. When was the last time you visited your mom's grave? Yesterday. I believe she knows that. I believe when the grave of someone who has died is visited, they can feel the love of the people they left behind. I'm really concerned about you. How much longer are you going to blame yourself for this, Nina? It was not your fault. Your mother died because she was sick. You know that she tried committing suicide several times. I should have taken better care of her. Well, there are some things we just can't foresee. I did see. What do you mean? Well… the day before it happened, I was talking to her at the dinner table. Just sharing stories about the kids. Suddenly, I felt something staring at me from the corner. I don't think my mom saw it. She was having too much fun. I didn't understand at first. But I understand now. What? I could have stopped it from happening. You don't believe me. Look at you. You think I'm crazy. I don't. I just don't understand these things. I'm a logical guy. I don't like these supernatural kinds of things at all. Do you think I want to see these things? I don't, Hasan. Nina. You know I love you right? You are everything to me. But your hallucinations won't change anything. You can't change the past, Nina. I'm sorry. The door was open, so I came in. I didn't know anyone was home. Who are you? Are you Mr. Hasan's wife? I am, and who are you? My name is Narsih. I'm the one taking care of Mother back in the village. Mother? Mr. Hasan's mother. Her condition is getting worse every day. Some days she is fine, but some days, she's worse. She doesn't remember much anymore. It's that bad? She's beginning to see things. We can only say, "There's no one there, Mother. You're the only one in the house." The doctor said that that is normal for people her age. I'm sorry, I don't remember what the medical term for it is. When was the last time you and Mr. Hasan came to visit? Well, I've never been there. Why not? My husband never wants to go. Is there any problem between Mr. Hasan and his mother? By the way, sorry, but why are you here? I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't come to ask for money. I'm here to inform you that I'm leaving. I can't take care of her anymore. And we don't know how much longer she'll be with us. What do you mean? Maybe it's time for the son to take care of his mother. Maybe that's what she really needs. CHILD PROTECTION Mother has Alzheimer's, but I wasn't aware that it had gotten so bad. You mean you knew this whole time? And you did nothing? Narsih probably thought we were terrible people. Narsih? Next time, just give her some cash. Mother is getting old. Don't you think it's time we paid a visit? I don't think that's a good idea. So, your mother is still alive? How come we've never met her? My mother lives very far away. That's why we never visit. So, why don't we just visit? God, you're so nosy! Hasan. Why don't we go and pick her up? That's impossible. -Who else will take care of her? -You know how busy I am! Your mother can use my mother's room. I can help you, Hasan. I don't have time to take care of her. The relationship between me and my mother is different from yours and your mother's. We have our own lives. -But nobody is taking care of her. -It's different! You know nothing. Finish your dinner, Ryan. You, too, Tasha. I know that all parents are different. But mothers always love their children. I know that because I'm a mother, too. Honestly, I don't want to go back there again. Did something happen between you? It's nothing. Babe, please just wait a second and listen to me. No one is taking care of your mother. We don't have to be there long. All we have to do is bring her back home. I understand that you're extremely busy with your job, but I will take care of her. I just lost my mother. I don't want you to feel the same regret that I feel. And you promised to spare some time for the kids. Right? This place isn't even on Google Maps. Enjoy it while you can, Tasha. It's not every day you get to get away from it all. Our nearest neighbor is about an hour away from here. Where's Ryan? Ryan! Where is he? Ryan! Hey, what are you doing here? I don't know! You still have the house keys? There are only two sets of keys. One is with my mother, and the other set is this. -Assalamu alaikum. -Come in. Assalamu alaikum. Fix the luggage. All right, kids, you stay right here. We are going to go check on Grandma. -OK, Mom. -One minute. Shall we? How come dad looks so gloomy in this picture? Maybe when this picture was taken, daddy wanted to poo. Mother? Hasan! Mother? Mother? Do you hear that? Hear what? Do you hear that? Mother, it's me, Hasan. It's me, Hasan. Hasan? Yes, Mother. Mother! Mother, please let go of the knife. Please, Mother. OK? You haven't changed one bit. This one looks just like you. His hair, his eyes, his teeth… A spitting image. Now, this one doesn't look like you. She looks like she lives in her own little world. Maybe she takes after her mom. Mother, have you taken your medicine? Those medicines only make me weak and give me headaches. I wasn't aware you were coming, so I didn't prepare anything. It's all right, Mother. It was also a surprise trip for us. I didn't even bring my praying attire. You can use mine. That isn't your room. Why is the door locked? It has always been locked. Why? Stop asking, Ryan. Your room is over there. You mean we have to share a room? Well, Tasha, this isn't a hotel. I know, Mom. If this was a hotel, there'd be welcome drinks and WiFi. Come on. I'm going to go get the kids settled in. They've had a long day, and Hasan and I haven't done our evening prayers. -You know where to face? The arah qibla? -I don't. There. Right where that tree is. Does your laptop never run out of power? My deadline is in two days. What are you looking for? My paper. I saw it. It was on your desk at home. Oh my goodness. How could I leave it at home? How am I going to finish my work now? Well, we're headed back tomorrow. You'll still have time to finish it. I miss my mother. Ryan, what are you doing? I'm looking for my pencil case. It's not there. Sis, someone's standing in front of the house. Who? I don't know. Why are you both still awake? Ryan was the one running around. I've been here this whole time. Who is she? I don't know. Maybe it's a zombie. There are no zombies in this village. She is just staring at the house. Haven't slept yet? No, Mother. Come here. Let me hold you My son Kiss Kiss, don't cry My handsome boy If you cry You're not handsome Hey, you guys are up already. I have made mie ongklok, nasi megono, geblek, and tempe kemul. When did you cook all this, Mother? I always wake up early. Your kids have both eaten already. Mother. The reason why Nina and I came here is to bring you back home with us to Jakarta. You're all alone up here with no one to take care of you. I can find someone proper. Let me get it for Hasan! If you don't like nasi megono, Do you want mie ongklok instead? Can I get it for you? -I'll prepare a big portion. -Put it back, Mother. Now, let's sit down. Did you hear anything I said just now? This is our house. You should be the one staying here. I can't, Mother. I am busy. I have to go back home to Jakarta. Excuses! Mother, Hasan has a wonderful opportunity at his workplace. What does he do? He is a child psychologist. He is quite well known, too. Hasan. You? A child psychologist? -Mother… -Hasan. I think what Hasan is saying is that if you come back and stay with us, you'll get to be close to the kids. That's all, Mother. I absolutely can't leave this house, not under any circumstances. You should know that. Mother, no one's looking after you here. If I don't take care of this house, who else will? All right, give me a hug I'll be back soon. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. Mom, why does dad get to go home? He has some important business. We'll go home when he's back. So, we're stuck here, is that it? We're not stuck here. We're on vacation. Well, I'm going to head back inside. Ryan, let me take a pic of you right there. Come on, do it properly. Don't look like a dummy. Can't even stand being in his own house… He just has some important work to do. We all came here to bring you back with us. I don't need to be picked up. Yes, but no one is taking care of you here. Not even Narsih. Narsih? The nice lady who has been taking care of you this whole time. I don't know her. I've been alone this entire time. Is it nice? Do you want some more? No, thanks. I've had enough. Excuse me. Who are you? I'm Nina, Hasan's wife. I'm your daughter-in-law. These are your grandchildren. -Do you want to drink? -Don't touch me! Do you hear that? What do you hear mother? Do you hear that? "Ari Kiba." Stop it! Don't cry! This is not your responsibility! I am going to my room. I'm a bit tired. -Grandma is nuts, right, Mom? -Ryan! I am just asking, Mom! Where did you learn to talk like that? -Tasha said it first. -Ryan! I never said that. -She said it, Mom. -Ryan! -Yes, you did! -No, I didn't, Ryan! OK, stop it. Ryan, the point is, you should never say that again. She is your grandma, and both of you should take care of her. Just like you're going to take care of me when I'm old, right? Of course, Mom. I would never leave you alone like this. How about you, Ryan? Well, Mom, I promise to always take care of you, even when you are nuts. Can't you stop texting for, like, five minutes? I'm not texting, Mom. I'm just editing some photos. Go to sleep. Come on, Ryan. You can continue your drawing tomorrow. Who is this little one? I don't know. Ryan! Ryan, don't disturb me! Ryan! Ryan. Ryan! What are you doing? Don't joke around, OK? I'm going to tell Mom. Ryan! What are you doing? Hey, sis! There is something I want to show you. I needed to pee, but I woke up too late. All right, you can sleep in my bed. For real, Mom, this house is creepy. Let's just go home. We have to wait for your father. We are going home afterward, right? Who's going to take care of your grandma? What a pain. You can't talk like that. But it's true, Mom! You can't say stuff like that. Listen to me, Tasha. Your grandmother is very sick. If we all leave, no one is going to take care of her. Don't you feel sorry for her? I can't do it. I need a pickaxe. Mother. Please, hand me the knife. Mother, please. Please, hand me the knife. Please, give me the knife. Hand me the knife. Give it to me, please. Come inside. Is your mother still alive? No, she isn't. Was she ill? It was just her time. Were you close to her? Yes, we were. But in her last days, I didn't give her enough attention. Suddenly, I'm craving a cup of ginger tea. Do we have some ginger? Mother, I can't leave you alone now. I will be fine. Why don't we wait until Hasan gets back? A cup of ginger tea. It usually calms me down. Here are the keys. Lock up from the outside, OK? Hold onto your brother. Stay right here, OK. Don't move an inch. Look after your brother. Stay there, Ryan. Hello! Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, I want to buy something! Excuse me, please, I want to buy something! Sir? I am so sorry, miss. I haven't slept for two days. The locals came here asking for help. Don't you want to put on some pants, sir? Sorry, miss. I've been so busy. Folks up and down the mountain have been coming here for help. What kind of help? All kinds of help. Spiritual help. Religious advice. Non-medical illnesses. Marriage counseling. Even for manhood therapy. They look for me. -Two batteries, please. -Right, of course. How are you related to Mrs. Dayu? You know? Of course I know. Is her house still full of disturbances? Tasha, look after your brother! I can help with those sorts of things. Things like ghost sightings. Haunted houses. Despoiled graves. Possessions. Missing children. My expertise has far greater value than my little shop here. -Missing children? -Yes. A kid went missing around here once in the past. Drove the mother mad. She went crazy. Tasha! Where's Ryan? I don't know, Mom. What did I tell you? -Ryan. -Ryan! -Didn't I tell you to look after him? -I don't know, Mom. -Ryan! -Ryan! Ryan. -Oh my God, Ryan! -Ryan. -Ryan. -Ryan where are you? -Ryan! -Ryan! Ryan! -Ryan! -Ryan! Ryan, where are you? -Oh my God, Ryan! -Ryan! Where are you? -Where is Ryan, Mom? -I don't know! -Ryan, where are you? -Ryan! Ryan! Ryan, oh my goodness. What are you doing here, my love? We've been looking for you all over the place! I told you not to run off anywhere! I was so worried. Thank God you're OK. Please, don't ever do that again, OK? -You two, wait right here. -Yes, Mom. -Don't move. -Yes, Mom. -Tasha, watch over your brother. -OK. It's not me. You're the one who's nuts. You're nuts. Not me! She's nuts. BOY PRESUMED MISSING A crazy person plants potatoes, plants everything. Try planting something else. BOY PRESUMED MISSING I don't want to go to the mountain alone. But the mountain is very hot now. I forgot to drink the coffee. It's going to get cold. Where's my coffee? Without it, it's like I haven't eaten. Without coffee, I feel thirsty! Thirsty! THE PRESENTATION WENT WELL I'LL PICK YOU GUYS UP SOON. LOVE YOU. Is Hasan back? Not yet. He just texted me. Thank God, his work went well. What? That Safety of Children thing? He doesn't deserve it. "Ari Kiba." Nina! Hey! It's me. Is there something you are hiding from me? What do you mean? About this house. This house is fine. -You have to tell him, Mother. -Tell me what? Something is haunting Mother. Hasan, 25 years ago, a child went missing in this village. His name was Dimas Rangga. His mom is the lady who always stands in front of this house. -Where did you hear all this? -I saw Narsih today. The one who said she looked after Mother. Well, she didn't. Mother has been alone this whole time. She pretended to be working here. Just ask Mother yourself! What happened to her hand? I don't remember. Hasan! She cut herself, but she's OK now. I took the knife away from her. If you'd taken the knife, she wouldn't be hurt. Are you trying to sabotage my work? This has nothing to do with your work! It's been just one day, and everything's gone wrong. How will you take care of her back home? Something is haunting this house, Hasan. Its name is Ari Kiba. It has been haunting Mother for years. -I thought the child was Dimas Rangga? -It is. So, who's Ari Kiba? I don't know Hasan! We have to find help. This is something we can't understand. That's impossible! This is a small village. We say one thing, and the whole village will know. There is a ghost of a child in this house! I saw it myself. Please listen to me. Why don't you calm down and stop thinking about this nonsense? Mother. Has something been bothering you? Nothing has been bothering me. I just need to rest. Mother. You have to tell him, please. Mother. Hasan, I swear to God that this isn't one of my hallucinations I swear! You have to believe me. The kids also saw it. Enough Nina! -Hasan. -I'm tired. I'm tired. Who is this? I don't know. Who is this kid that you drew? He looks like you did when you were a kid. You don't live here. The spirit is here, and yet it is far away. Ari Kiba. Ari Kiba. What is happening to Mother? Ari Kiba. Ari Kiba. -Mother! -Hold on Hasan. Ari Kiba. Ari Kiba! That's enough! I said enough! Don't you dare mess with my mother like this. If she won't come home with us tomorrow, I don't know what else to try, Nina. When will you stop running away from your problems? Who is running away? I am not running away. I am being realistic. I feel like we can't be safe here, and I want to leave. It's as simple as that. Did anything happen in the past? -What could have happened? -I don't know! That's between you and your mother. If anything did happen in the past, it was before our time in this house. This place is old. There are three-to-five families who've lived here before us. The possibilities are endless. I know that your mother's death has been traumatic, and that you now want to redeem yourself by saving mine. But you have to remember, it is not that easy. My mother is sick because she is old, not because of this house. Don't try and turn everything into some mystic nonsense just to prove your theory. I can't take this anymore. What is the matter, Mother? He was a good boy. Who? By the way. Have you made me the ginger tea? And is Hasan not back from school yet? I haven't picked him up. He is always too scared to walk home alone. Don't worry, Mother. I picked him up. You should get some rest. You will feel much better tomorrow with your medicine. Let's head to bed. Is everything packed up? The kids? They are ready. I haven't seen Mother this morning. I should check on her. Nina. We have tried our best. Please don't be too upset. If she doesn't want to come, we can't force her. Our lives, my career… They aren't here. Everything is in Jakarta. Let me try and talk to her one last time. Mother. You ruined my photos. Stop it, kids. Mother, time to get up. Mother. Get into the car. Mother. Mother… Looks so cool. Wow! Please change it. No. Please change it. ANTIDEPRESANT What is this? Let's see… Looks cool. We have to wake up early tomorrow so we don't hit traffic. Finally! We are going home. Don't you think it's better if we clean up first? What's left to clean? All of Mother's stuff. Mother is gone. Are you saying you want to stay here? I want to sleep with Mom and Dad. I don't feel comfortable anymore staying here. It'll be just for the night. We are going home tomorrow. Is Mom OK? She is fine. She is just a little sad. Do you hear that? Ari Kiba. Ari Kiba! -You know where to face? The arah qibla? -I don't. Right where that tree is. I need a pickaxe. Stop it! Don't cry! It's not your responsibility. Missing child? Drove the mother mad. Nina! Stop it! He was a good kid. Your curiosity is a bit much. How much longer were you planning on hiding this? I told you that I didn't want to come back to this house. But you forced me. Mother was right. All you do is run away from your problems. When I was a kid… I was a stubborn kid. I always wanted to win. I don't know if this was Mother's teaching or if it was just my own messed-up personality. Dimas was the only one who would come to play with me every day. Mother loved him like a son. We were like brothers. And like all brothers, we were rivals. Who was her favorite? Who had the better drawings? Who was the strongest? We did the best we could for Mother. Everything was for her… and everything happened so fast. I wasn't thinking clearly, and suddenly… Dimas was on the floor, and my hand was covered in blood. Mother only wanted to protect me I know what she did was wrong, but… But she panicked, and she didn't want anything to happen to me. Just remember this, Hasan. This is not your responsibility. It will always be our secret. Dimas' mother came by the house. She was panicking. She was looking for Dimas. But I saw Mother stay serenely calm, like nothing ever happened. Let me hold you My son If you loved her, why did you kill her? What are you talking about? She showed me. -She was putting us in danger. -Us? She was going to let it slip. It would have spread everywhere. We've made a happy family. Building my career wasn't easy, either. I was not going to throw that all away over some mistake I made when I was younger. That problem was between me and my mother. I love you and I love our children. Please, give me another chance. What do you want me to do? I want you to forgive me. I want us to start over again. I want us to be honest with each other, and this time, I promise I won't hide anything from you. We should return this boy to his mother. I am going to talk to Ustad Dirman and find someone who can help. Who can process this. I hope… we can return this boy to his mother. I beg you not to tell the kids yet. We will tell them later. Tasha, Ryan. I told you, I never wanted to come back here. You forced me. Tasha! Tasha, open the door! Tasha! Hurry, please. We have to leave now. -What's happening? -I will tell you later. Where's Dad? We have to hurry. -Where are we going? -Hurry! Get into the car. Get into the car! I will tell you later. Get into the car. Oh my God! -Stay here. Don't go anywhere. -Where are you going? Now is not the time! -Don't go anywhere! -Mom! Stay here! Get in the car now! Hurry up! Ryan, hurry up! Aren't we waiting for Dad? Not now, Tasha. Mom. Why aren't we waiting for Dad? Enough Tasha. Just stay here and don't go anywhere. Where are you going? Where are you going, Mom? -Just stay here and don't go anywhere. -Mom. Do not move! OK. -Take care of Ryan! -OK, Mom. -Are you OK? -I'm OK. I believe when the grave of someone who has died is visited, they can feel the love of the people they left behind. Mom, are we going to visit Dad's grave next? BORN 04-01-1982, DIED 14-09-1989
