Don't fear, when the 48-hour cycle ends, we will be back to normal. Izzy! What have I told you about being out here? Come on, inside, now! Mom? I think it's time. I think it's time we told her the truth. For her safety. The curse. He will rise soon. Izzy, love. We have something we should have told you a long time ago. We think that now is the time to tell you the truth about our family. About the land that we live on. And about the curse that our family has had for generations. What is it, Mom? For generations, our family goes back to one fatal evening in the spring of 1910 when a man, your great-great-great-grandfather, Antony Web, was brutally murdered by locals. You see, they thought he was stealing, so they strung him up on a cross in the cornfields and they left him for dead. He starved. And the crows pecked out his eyes, but there was also what the legend doesn't tell. His soon-to-be-wife, Mary-Lou Jameson, she was also murdered by the locals. They thought she was stealing alongside him. So she was taken to a stable on this land, and she was set on fire. They both died on this land, leaving nothing but one child in the protection of neighbors who promised to raise the baby as if it was their own. These people from our family. They were murdered? The curse goes that Antony is seen on this land. For years there have been old wives tales about him, cursing him to be a scarecrow. Roaming these lands every 20 years. And for 48 hours, he can take the lives of those who walk his land. He kills innocent people? They say his soul is trapped in the same time. For years, your nana and I have protected these lands ensuring that no one gets hurt. As you come into yourself, we must make you a protector, too. We've kept this a secret for many years, but tonight, the Scarecrow will rise to seek his bride. I'm scared. Look, we're safe inside. We stick together and we're safe. As long as no one leaves the house, stepping on his land, then we are safe. We're gatekeepers now, Izzy. Do you want me to stay with you tonight? Yeah. Yeah. Look, our family's lived on this farm for generations protecting the family secret. Why does Antony, why does this Scarecrow, why does he want to hurt people? Anyone on his land is in danger, he's not evil, he's just tormented by the curse of the fields. Would he hurt us? Look, as long as we stay inside and we don't disturb him, then we're safe, okay? And then in the morning, we'll go out, and we protect the land and make sure no one trespasses. Are we related to Antony? Is this why we protect his secret? We're related to his wife-to-be, Mary-Lou. Was she innocent? The legend goes that they were wrongly-accused, but no one knows. Okay, look, this is a lot for you to take in, now just go to sleep and forget about it till the morning, okay? Mom? Izzy. Izzy! Scarecrow? Antony. Mom! Mom! She was here, she was right here, he's got her! Where the hell did you get that from? In case anything like this happened! Come on! It's open. You wait outside. No, Mom, you can't go in there alone. You wait here, this ends tonight. - Mom, please, no. - Sabina, please. Please, just, just stay. I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm fine. Izzy. This ends here. Mom? Mom! Mom! Izzy. Shh! Izzy. Izzy, where are you? Mom! I can hear you, Izzy, it's me. Izzy. I mean, I just think if she was being stalked for all this time, then the police would have found some evidence. I mean, this case went on for years. I have to go against you and say I honestly think there was a stalker. So you don't think it was all in her head? No, I mean, the picture the police painted, sure. But when you look at how her body was found. How did she have hog ties on? Well you don't think she could've just put them on herself? No, I think someone killed her, I just can't imagine a person being able to do that to themselves. Okay, guys, I'm afraid we are out of time, but please do let us know your thoughts on the fan page. Do you think Mona killed herself, or do you think she was murdered? This 1984 case still remains unsolved. You're listening to May Sealey on May the Dead Rest. This is our limited-series event where we'll be discussing unresolved murders of the 1980s. Do let us know your thoughts, until next time. Hello, uh, you wanted to see me? Yeah. How do you feel the show went today? Yeah, good, I mean, it's a really fun show to be on. Why? Well... It's not about what I like, it's more about what the listeners like and, you lost half your audience today and, uh, that makes your slot the least listened to slot all week. Oh. I mean, I could get more controversial with my opinions. I could jazz it up a bit, I could... Look, let me cut to the chase here, I mean, this just isn't working. And I'm sure you're more than aware that, your show, it's just not what you wanted it to be. Yeah, that's 'cause of the stories! I mean, the stories that I get given, they're absolutely crap, there's only so much I can do! Let's not look at layin' the blame here. We're putting you on an earlier slot. God, please don't tell me the early morning... It's the two to six AM slot. Really? Seriously? That's absolute suicide. I can't believe you're doing this to me. So you'll do your last afternoon drive time slot today, and then we'll go from the early slots from then on. Absolutely gutted, I don't know what to say. Okay, thanks for the opportunity. You have a phone call on line two. Okay, thanks. May speaking. What? Oh, my god. Really? Yeah, look at it. - What's that? - I don't know! I think it's some sort of sheep or a goat or something. Do you have goats there? So you're telling me... Yeah, that I've inherited this, this property. - What the hell, May? - I know! I mean, apparently I'm next in line to inherit this plot of land and everything. Does your mum know? No I don't think I'm gonna tell her either, to be honest. I don't think I really care how she feels. She's never given you any idea as to who your father was? No, never. So what are we waiting for? Let's bail! You don't think it's a bit weird? I mean, a father that I've never met all of a sudden just dies and then I inherit this property. It's just a bit too good to be true All I see is a gold mine Yeah, of course you do. Do you think I should just sell it then? Babe, sell it, rent it out, do whatever. Just get out this shitty job that doesn't respect your talents. Oh god, yeah, I didn't even think of that. The way I see it, it solves all your worries. Oh, my god, do you think I should quit my job? Do it now. Okay, oh, my god. - What, right now? - Why not? Oh, my god, okay! Right, okay. Hang on. Hello? Connie? Hiya, yeah, it's May. Sorry. Yeah, just a quick one, really. I just wanted to say that I won't be coming in today. I actually won't be coming in for rest of the week. Actually, I'm not gonna be coming in at all, okay, bye. Fuck! That's what I'm talkin' about. - That's what I'm talkin' about. - She's gonna go mental! Alright. The map's saying it's about a four-hour journey. Oh, really? Well I've packed loads of stuff in here like snacks and stuff, so just help yourselves. Are you excited to own a farm? Um, yeah! I mean, it's just a bit weird, it's just a bit out the blue. No one's ever mentioned this side of the family, not ever? No, I don't know anything about my biological parents. Are you gonna tell about this to your adoptive parents? No, I mean, they weren't exactly good parents to me. I'm pretty sure they just adopted me to get more benefits. If I told them, they'd want half the money. Aw, you have us, we're a different type of family. Yeah. Do you think this could be a good story for your radio show? May the Dead Rest. Farmland murders. Yeah, but we need to find out what happened to these people, so come on! Well, I guess that's what we're about to do! Uh, what is with that suitcase? It's just the essentials. What, like your whole wardrobe? You can take the man out the city, but you can't take the city out the man. - Oh, my god, cheese on toast. - Come here. So, what's with bringin' your friends? Sorry, but they're like my family! I know they're a bit weird but they're all I've got. I wanna celebrate. - Very sentimental. - I know, I know. But it'll be fun, come on! Okay, get in the car. Alright. Let's get this trip on the road! Wallcreak Manor, here we come. - Hi. - Hi. - Mister Hammerson? - Please call me Tony. Hi, May, nice to meet you. I hope you don't mind, I brought some of my friends with me. It's your new home. - Do you wanna come inside? - Yes, please, it's so cold So, what's the big catch? Now that I've signed, it's your cue to tell me this big mystery about this place. Your relatives, the ones that owned the property before. They vanished without a trace. It was just over a year ago now. They were recently classified as deceased, so now the property is being moved onto the next in line, which is yourself. Your father was the son to Tracey Warren. She was your grandmother. Her, her daughter and granddaughter, vanished from this property. What do you mean, vanished? It's just like they picked up, packed up and took off. Never to be seen again. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. But I can imagine the concern it brings to you. But what I can say is whatever happened then, it's believed to be gone now, so, so now it's up to you. The property is yours, to sell. It's yours now. There's some lovely local produce up the road. Oh, lovely. Bit of a drive but... Signal's pretty bad around here, but I'm on the other end of the line. Okay, well, thank you so much. It was really nice to meet you. - Thanks, May. - Thank you. Whoa. So, they have no idea what happened to them? No idea. He said it's like they just picked up and vanished. Look, it's still on the cards that they could literally have gone off for a new life, right? Hm. Doesn't seem likely. So, May, what are you thinking of doing with this house? I don't know. I think maybe I'll just sell it. I mean, the sort of money a place like this could give me, I could actually study journalism. Then I wouldn't have to work for such twats that just wanna hear me talk about torture porn stories. I mean, it's not like I actually knew the people that lived here, I had no relationship with them at all. I mean, there's nothing actually keeping me here. Hell yeah, you're absolutely right. Mark this as a payment for your dad never being around. Anya. What? You're right. This is a good thing. Shit. They have real chickens. Oh. Hey, baby. Hello. Hey, Anya! Yeah? - What? - Anya? Yeah, I'm coming. Is that blood? Oh, come on, Chris. What? Don't be saying shit like that around May, she'll freak. I'm sure that's blood. Blood, paint. Hell, it could even be chicken blood? Who knows? Oh, come on. I'm sure the police did a good scout around here. You have to loosen up a little bit. Just stop running your thoughts. Chill, dude, hm? Cool. Anya, I think this looks like more blood. You're kidding me. Babe? What do you want me to do with the boxes? Uh, just unpack them in the kitchen. Why, hello, my busters. MythBuster himself here. Anyone looking to get into the spooky spirit of the dead, this certainly will not disappoint. Sit back. Relax. Maybe turn on a light. I recently read of a story, a supposed true story, that takes place on the other side of the pond, England. Scarecrow. Myth. Reality. I know what you may all be thinking. Scarecrow, isn't that just a stuffed costume that the farmer puts out, stuffs with hay to scare away the scarecrows? But the actual origin of the scarecrow has a whole lot more to it than that. Now this supposed true story takes place in 1991 with a girl named June whose parents were murdered. Now June is fully convinced that a scarecrow killed her parents, but from what I read though, it looks to be a robbery that went wrong and the parents died and the only people that survived were June and her brother, that's what I could tell. Now, fast forward to 2016, 20 years later, on the anniversary of her parents' death, June's brother gets found dead of a supposed suicide on the same land where her parents had died. So now, June, the very next day, after her brother has died of apparent suicide, June, along with her best friend and her therapist, Go to the house to try and clean it up. Whoa. Oh, what a beautiful horse. Wow. Yo, where did you find that? It was inside there. You think it was her nana's? - Maybe? - Oh, sexy. Who the hell are you? You shouldn't be on this land. Our friend owns it. - Friend? - May Sealey? The owner as of today. Who the hell are you? Young girl inherits a farm? Be careful in this period. You know the owners went missing, right? Why don't you get off this land before we call the cops here? I was here first! Yeah? And I bet the police would like the hear that, too. Now, get your crap and get the hell out of this land! Go and find a homeless shelter or something. Why do you wanna sleep in the farm anyway? Gross. Posh bitches. We're calling the cops in five minutes, just get walking! Anya? Christine? Hello? Hello. Who's in there? No! No, don't take that! It's that time again. Once again, we are in fear of his presence. Unable to leave. The curse of the scarecrow has cursed our family for years, never allowing us to move on, move forward. Trapped in a cycle for generations to stop others from becoming in danger. For decades. Every year. He returns. Our family has dedicated years of our lives to protecting the secret. Never allowing others to be hurt by the curse that was put on the land. I can't have my family harmed. But as my granddaughter gets older in age, I fear. She needs to know. The truth. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, all good. Just clearin' up. You find anything upstairs? What have you got there? Just some stuff, you know, stuff that was boxed away. Evidence? It was left out by the hallway. - What did you find? - Well... People have gone missing from this land before. As in, before the people who lived here. More have vanished. Wait. Let me see. Babe, it's crazy, check it out. Every year, even more so than last year, people have gone missing from this area. And not even just from here. Check out the map. In Essex, June Sommers, Karen Gilbert, Nancy Strong. You know what's nuts? It's all been around the same timeframe as your relatives gone missing. Could be a coincidence. What does the reporter in you think? She thinks it's something more than a coincidence. A cult maybe? Scarecrow? - A scarecrow? - I know, I know. It's ridiculous as hell. Babe, I couldn't make it up, even if I tried. These people are crazy. They actually believe that a scarecrow did it. Do you see what I see? - Deja vu, eh? - Oh, my god. We look so alike. Crazy, isn't it? - I found this in the barn. - Holy shit, May! Where did you find that? Well, I just found it in the barn! Okay, okay. Let's just put it somewhere safe, yeah? Let's go upstairs. - Which one do you prefer? - I have no preference. I see you ladies found the wine. Oh, she had some expensive shit. Yeah, here, check it out - Where did you find this? - It was out in the stables. Did you guys know that you own a bunch of farm animals? I wonder whose this was? Come on, let's grab a drink. - You're going to France? - Yeah. I've got this wicked apartment. - Wow. - In Nice. When did you decide that, when did you decide that? Well, a friend of mine gave me this place for six months. So, have you told your mom about the house? No. I don't think I'm going to, either. Can I ask why? I just think with everything that's happened it's probably best that we just carry on leading separate lives, you know? This house is so cool. I'd seriously consider selling it, you know. What am I supposed to do? Leave the city and become a little farm girl? What's wrong with that? It could be fun. What have you got there? It's nothing Whoa. Holy shit, girl. Looks like her twin, right? How strange to look so alike with someone you've never actually met. Do you believe in reincarnation? - I dunno. - I think it must be. I mean, there's gotta be something more than just us. What if you are her? Well, if I am her, I don't know that I am, do I? Do you know how she died? Long story. Explain, how? She was actually burnt alive. On this land. It was the early 1900s and her husband, she was engaged, he was accused of being a thief, and she was painted with the same brush. So they threw her in the barn and they burnt her alive. God, holy crap. And her husband? Apparently he was turned into a scarecrow. The legend of a scarecrow comes from him. He was strung up like a scarecrow, starved, and then pecked to death by crows. My god, that's deep. Wait. I have an idea. What are we doing here? We are gonna try to invoke the spirit. See if Mary-Lou walks the barns anymore. Anya, stop. Nah, this is sick! Invoke spirit? It's probably total BS, but when I was doing a write-up on spirits, we all know I'm a believer, I read on how to invoke one. Trust me, it's total bullshit. No, come on, let's invoke the spirit of that girl. The one that I look like. Anya. May. Let's all hold hands. Are you kidding me, are we actually doing this? Come on, babe, it's not gonna work anyway. I summon you with my hold. You who hold the sight I see in the image. The body of God. The spirit of the devil. You who takes all those who come. You who refuses no one. Our great lady who exacts the price of blood. Mother and daughter. Destroy all the era and transform the world. Come to me now and change my life! Where did you get that god-awful spell from? I got it online, okay? Told you. Total. Fucking. Bullshit. What do we do now? What the fuck was that? Guys, I'm kinda getting creeped out now. I wonder if it's the spirit. Alright, let's get out of here. What the hell was that? I told you, my spell worked. That was no spell! So, what if the scarecrow is real? Anya. No, come on. Usually I'm not the supernatural believer, but they all vanished on this land. I think that was a coincidence. Okay, look, look. It's fine, it's fine, okay? Maybe just some fucked up wiring. Look, we've all have enough for the day. Let's hit the hay. You're so cute. What? The rose. I didn't get you no rose. Whatever. You know I love a romantic. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Okay. How you doing? I'm fine. Listen. I know it's a lot of shit to deal with and it's not easy finding out about your dad's side of the family, inheriting this house. I know it's hard. I just wanted to say that I'm here with you, okay? Okay? Yeah. I know. You sure? Did you just see something? See what? I don't know, I swear I just saw something. Babe, there's nothing there. Anya, there isn't a signal on my phone. Of course not, we're in the middle of nowhere. What? Is this you? No. "You're invited to a wedding." I didn't write that. You're invited, too. I found this in the bedroom earlier. What is it? I, I think it's some kind of journal. It was my grandmother's, the one that lived here before us. And it keeps an account of the time that she spent here. But the weirdest bit about it is that... Go on, babe, what is it? It's saying the same stuff that you discovered earlier/ It's saying she was protecting this land so no one could get hurt again. It was saying that people died under the hands of him. Him being? The scarecrow. Why is May outside so late? Let me check. She says he rises every 48 hours. May! Dude, what's with the music? I didn't turn it on. Why is May outside? - Outside? - Yeah! Come on. What the fuck? I saw her. Right here. How'd you know? I saw her from my window. Window? Let me check the house. May? I didn't turn this on. Holy straw. Fuck. Please. Don't, don't, don't. Who is it? Who's there? Darren, what the hell is going on? I don't think you'll believe me. I don't believe myself. Darren. Darren, where the hell did you find this? Listen, take this and shoot anything that you see. - What the hell is going on? - Go, Christine. Anya! Anya, what the, where's May, is she okay? - Get out of here. - May, where's May? Come on, bitch, see what mama's got for ya. Help me! Someone help me! Help! Help! That's not me. That's not me, that's not me. I'm not her. No, no, no, no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It is me. Remember? Mary-Lou. I died but I'm back now. I saw what they did to you. I was watching, I saw everything. They killed you for something that you didn't do. I saw it all. They strung you up and they starved you. And I saw what the crows did. They pecked you to death, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I've missed you. I've missed you. I'm the only one taking this bitch down the aisle. He's gone. What was that? He thinks I'm that girl from the photo. - Who is she? - Mary-Lou! The one who was murdered in the early 1900s. It's the curse of the scarecrow. It said that Anthony Web was tied up in the cornfield by the locals and starved to death, and then his wife-to-be, Mary-Lou, was burnt alive in the barn. They were both murdered by the locals by fear of theft! And Mary-Lou? - You're related? - Yeah! Apparently my bloodline has been protecting this curse of the scarecrow for years making sure no one else got hurt! - Well, something happened! - Yeah, they were all killed! How do we stop it? I don't think we can. May? Why was he trying to marry you? Because he wants Mary-Lou. He actually thinks that I am her. I don't think we can stop it. It says here that'll he'll attack anyone on this land, still thinking he's in the time of his death. Wait, "anyone who faces the scarecrow "must see it through the 48 hours. "Each hour of the curse is each hour until he died. "Once the 48 hours is up, the curse will be no more." We only have to wait 48 hours for the curse to be over. For goodness sake. We don't know when the 48 hours begun, mate. Well, then we need to get the hell out of here! I'll grab the keys, then. He wants me to be his bride. Darren! Get out of here. May! May! Oh, fuck. May! May! May, what're you doing? May! Stop! May! What're you doing? You want Mary-Lou? Stop. Stop! I have to do this, Darren. This won't stop. I have to do this. May. Please! It won't stop. May, no! - May, please! - Shush. This won't stop until I stop this. He won't stop until he's with Mary-Lou. In life and in death. I'm so sorry, Darren. May! I love you. Please, babe. Don't leave me! Shut the door, Darren. Shut the door, Darren! May, no. May! I'm sorry. You are not alone anymore. May the curse rest here forever.
