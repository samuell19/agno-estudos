What's up? Been summoned? Yes yes! Ma! Anu, ls there someone called Tomichan in your company? In HRD. Thomichan Kozrakkuzhi. Do you know him? Who's that? No idea. - They said he works at STAR. - Could be in the KP road office then. - Why? - Nothing... - Awedding proposal. - Whose wedding is it? - Mine. - Shut up! Where's your friend? I thought you guys wouldn't show up today. Busy at office, Uncle... That's why we're late. That's alright. I thought I should ask you all first. You are his close friends, right? This isn't for the first time. But it's been a few days now? And his phone is always switched off. Who knows what's happening. It's alright, Uncle. Don't worry. You know what he's like. He doesn't even call us. Didn't he tell anyone? Last Wednesday he was in Santhosh's room. - Didn't he say where he was going? - Seems he didn't. If he doesn't come today, we'll make a police complaint. Wait, Uncle. He'll be back. No, No! Something's wrong. He hasn't called anyone all these days. Uncle... don't take it to the Police now. Let's wait. We'll look. Let the Police also look. Uncle, it's better not to inform the Police now. - Let's wait. - But why? - Is there a problem? - There's no problem... Then? - Why take it to the Police unnecessarily? -It's not unnecessary! Leave it, Uncle. We'll find out. Where are we going to find him? How can we just ignore it and keep quiet? It's alrig ht. One of you come with me to the Police station in the morning. - Uncle... the problem is-- - What, you don't have the time? - It's not that. - Then? Uncle, don't go to the Police now. Why? We don't know if it's true... Ea a They say he's got a diamond, which he's trying to sell. That's probably why he's not coming home. Seems it's worth Rs. 20-30 Lakhs. - Where did you hear this? - People are talking. That's all we know. He doesn't tell us these things. But why's his phone switched off? Because of its high value he must be concerned about the safety and security. Security? Could be something like that. What's the time on your watch now? E E that means, at 6.25, you should call my number. If I don't answer, you should call me again after 5 minutes. If I still don't answer... call this number, and tell him that you can't reach me. Then he'll tell you what to do. Got it? Or give me another ring before calling on that number. Look, just three calls. After that, call this number. A a Then 6.30. After that you should call once again at 6.35. Only then you call on this number. Got it? Don't mess it up. No, no. Hits aim]? a Don't take the phone if anyone calls in between. Park it there. No, don't do it. That would only add to the confusion. Basheerbhai... It's Sibi. I'm in the lobby. Where in the lobby? I'm right here. Are you wearing a black shin? Yeah, black shin. I'm also wearing a black shin. So this is Sibi Sebastian. The MD changed his plans yesterday. That's why I asked you to come today. That's alright. He's a very busy man. He's staying back just becausel asked him. Listen... One more thing... Hereafter, we'll be dealing with you directly. If you have any partners you deal with them. Not us. - It's just me. - How do I know? I'm mentioning it because you're new to us. - Look Basheerbhai-- - Shhh... Don't ever discuss anything inside a lift. There's a camera on top. No, no the first 60 you were talking about works for me. No, no... that's not for me. Tell me, you should tell me. No hurry. But money stays the same. No. I can't afford more. That depends on how smart you are. No... no... I'll leave in the morning. Calicut to Sharjah. I'll call you later. Yeah. He is the one. - The gemstone. - Oh yeah. Sit down. A a Sit down. So... What gem is it? Emerald Emerald... Where did you get it from? Actually, someone got it from a temple in Trivandrum. - It's genuine. - Let me take a look. Show me the stone. Show me. Gh ow. In 9 In e a Dig tu “Us, I need to see the real stone. Yeah, I'll show you. But I need to clarify certain things before that. What? Well... suppose we do decide on a price... Hovv'll you pay me? By 00...? Or in cash? How? When? Where? Forget that now. Show me the stone first. Basheerbhai... So where's the stone? Kimmy Then what's the problem? You've seen the photo, rig ht? It's original. Nothing to worry. It's from a temple. It's real. But unless we give him an idea about the price he'll be suspicious. Him? Who's this 'him' that you've never mentioned before? The gem is with him. I see...! He's not answering the phone. Hey! You should've mentioned this earlier. I'll son it out. I just need to go to Trivand rum. - Give me two more days. - You're wasting our time. No, no, I'll handle it. Everything was going fine until someone interfered and changed his mind. Just give me an idea about the price. The MDjust told you, right... He can't give you a rate without actually seeing it. Unless we fix a price and give him an advance he won't show it. - 0k then do it. - I can't do it. You don't know my situation. Oh! Then don't get into such business. In this business, unless you invest you can't make money. - Have you really seen the gem? - Of course! I took this photo. Bhai... Yeah. What's that guy up to? He doesn't have the gem. Only that photo. What do you think, seeing the photo? It looks valuable. But he is helpless. Why? Now he says that the gem is with someone else. And that guy doesn't trust him. Then get that guy's details and get rid of this one. Let's deal directly. Okay? That's ok. He'll expect at least Rs.15,000. Give him something. He's not going to take your calls. Forget it. - Let me go to Trivand rum and see. - That's up to you. - We're also leaving. - God! So what about the gem? Gem... It's obvious that you can't pull this off. If you agree, give us his details and we'll contact him directly. Look, Bhai... I... We'll give you 10 Thousand rupees. Here. Give me his name and address. Only if you want to.. Yeah, I'm coming! Coming! Please hurry. Here. Do you know how long I've been chasing this? This doesn't even meet my daily expense. We're giving you this money without any surety. Only because it's you. You think we couldn't do it ourselves? Here. But, this is only nine thousand. Yeah, ten minus one is nine. - Minus one? -Yeah one is my commission. That's on you. 10% is usual in every business. - Bhai, shall I ask you something? - Hmm? - I know someone who's got a barn-owl. - What? A barn-owl. If you're interested, I can get it for you. It's genuine. Will the MD be interested? Bugger off, son... Bugger off! - Where are you? - I'm around. Your parents are worried. You better call them. They think you're missing. They're upset. And what do I tell them? That I've been found? It's easy for you to switch off your phone and vanish. I'm the one who gets the calls! Forget it! Are you home tomorrow? Yeah. - Then I'm coming. - Come over. Listen, I'm not joking. Call your parents right away. I'll handle it! Where were you? I've been ringing the bell for a while. I was drying my clothes on the terrace. Planning to settle down here? No way! You should go home. Let my clothes dry first. I did call home. Everything's fine there. What about you? Are you working in the afternoon? In your honor, I'll sleep off this afternoon. What do you want for lunch? What's available? - Beef, porotta, chapathi, chicken... - 2 Porottas and a plate of beef fry. Hello. Hi I'm calling from Kargil colony... the house next to the ground. Yeah. One biriyani... Chicken biriyani, three porottas and a beef fry. Forever porotta and beef! Go home and eat something nice. Dude, never look down upon any food. Porotta & beef is the favorite food of millions of our people. Is it right to belittle it, eh Santhosh? Drinking a lot these days? No way. Once in a while. I couldn't ask you last time. You were too tense. What's happening with your diamonds and rubies? I was wondering when you would ask. - Did it work out? - No. It's all over. Everything was going well. But somehow it didn't happen. That's how it is. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. It's said that even a tiger makes a kill only after trying and failing ten times. So what are our chances? Where did you get this Tiger info? I... read it in a children's magazine. We're still subscribing to it. Dude... - Hey!! - Yeah? My Wedding's fixed. Fantastic! When was it fixed? Only two days. It was sudden. - Is it that Valsa?- - Sheesh! She got married long back. This is Leena Maryam George Kudappanakunnel. Anyway it had to happen one day. So why put it off? So you're also getting hitched. Cool! I'm glad that she works here. We can continue to live here. Yeah that's right. You needn't look for another house. But no one's seeing how doors are closing on this poor Wayfarer... It's not going to be you or me who decides your place in this house in future. It will be Kudappanakunnel Leena Maryam George. - It will depend entirely on her attitude. - And what is it? How would I know? What's her attitude towards you? Anyway, both of us will have to change our routes. Two people who walked on two paths will have to walk on the same path now. The problem with small paths is, that they is narrow. One person will have to walk in front and the other at the back. If you don't argue about that, things will go well. I've no fight about anything. Parcel. Keep the balance. I wonder who did these jobs before these guys came to Kerala. If they hadn't come, people like you may have had some work. Drink! Do you know... the world economy... The most important factor for it's stability is poverty. It's because there are so many poor people in this world... that the rich get cheap labour. For their prosperity, there should always be poverty in the world. Understood? Is this also from your children's magazine? Shut up! Look at me. If I had Rs.5 lakhs yesterday, I could've made Rs. 20 Lakhs on the spot. But I didn't have 5 lakhs. So my loss was 20 lakhs. He who has 5, will make 20, 30, 50 and so on. He who doesn't have it will sit here like a sucker. I'm having another drink. I'm starting to feel hungry. People here gossip that I'm a jobless fraud. My friends are married and settled while I'm not. - Who says so? - Forget it. I know things about life that they don't. The future is all about freelance business. - I'll show them soon. - That's up to you. But your ideas are not at all realistic. What do you mean 'not realistic'? All your schemes need crores of money. That's the problem. Then I'll be realistic and start a small paan shop. Will you join me? Dude, my aim is to hit the jackpot. I don't want to be like you and work for someone else my entire life. You and your theories! Has anything ever worked out? It's just a waste of money. It's not my theory that's wrong. It's my calculation that went wrong. I don't have the money. But I'll find someone soon. I'll show you then. Don't blame anyone. It's a crooked business. Crooked? We buy something at a lower price and try and sell it at a higher price. I know how it works. It's not crooked. It is crooked. You live in a world of fantasy.

Who's in Jharkhand now? Ah Do you know anyone who can help me? I wouldn't do such a thing. 0k! 0k! I'll call you. 0k! It's not us. But you'll have to pay anyway. This is a Central Govt.'s fund. But the State Govt. ls in charge. How did you get hold of this? Well... - It's ok if it's a secret. - No, Tham ba'cha. When I go to discuss it people might ask details. It'll look bad if I don't know the details. The details are simple. I'll tell you. There's money to buy 10,000 cycles for tribal women. But no one knows about it. The question is whether we can get the contract or not. What if we get it? We can get the cycle for half the price and make a profit. - Tell me the details. - It is simple. We'll quote the local price. Which is about 4000 for a cycle? But we'll buy it for less than 2000. - How come? - Thamba'cha... You do know, that China has the most cycles in the world. Really? Yes. But no one wants cycles there. They all want cars and bikes. Cycles don't sell because no one buys them. If we make the right moves, we'll get it for the price we want. - Are you talking about second hand cycles? - No, brand-new! But they don't have ladies' cycles. - We can't help it. - That's alright. Another thing... If we manage to import them duty free our profit goes up. We'll highlight that it's for tribal women. - So that's 10,000... into - Make it 4,000. - Four crores. - Yeah, four crores. - Our share? - Minimum two crores! A a Where did you get these details? He has lost interest in all this. We'll pay him something. I'll take care of that. Is this for real? What son of a question is that Thambacha? Do you know anyone is China? I know someone who's studying there. His friend's father runs a cycle business. That's howl came to know about all this. We'll need money to go there and study the situation. Yeah. Very necessary. Yeah. You'll have to arrange the money. I've invested my money in another business. It's tied up. That's not possible. We'll invest fifty-fifty. I brought the project, right? So, consider my commission as my share. From now on I'll have to deal with everything. What if I ask you for a commission? Think about that. Look, they'll begin work only if we give an advance. We'll need money. Or you should bring someone who has money. But your share will go down. You'll even be slowly removed from this business. Hey! Wash it properly. You won't hurt it. We can give him a cheque. But that's not the problem. - He needs a guarantee. - Of course. It's not a big deal of money. Why's he asking for property-documents? A a We have Mortuary Shaji... then there's lsmu. Ismu? Yeah. Only they'll be ready to deal without any guarantee. - I can't ask lsm u. -Why? Do you owe him anything? A Em Em a I can give a cheque and sign a stamp paper. Babukutty said you could put in a word for me. What can I say? There's no point. I just need it for six months. I'm very sure. That's not enough. They should also feel sure. The thing about Shaji and lsmu is that they're sure. They know how to get their money back. Hey, I'm hungry. I've other things to do. I'm hungry(In Hindi). What have you decided? How old is he? The elephant. - Wait. I'm also coming. -Where? Give me the key. I'll drop you where your cab comes. E a No. I can't walk all that distance in the evening. Even getting an autorikshaw is impossible. DearAnumol, I have an emergency. I'll return it by afternoon. Where'll you leave the key? - I'll take the duplicate. - It's somewhere in the cupboard. - I don't have the time. - That's ok. I'll look for it. A a - What happened? - He needs the scooter. How will you go then? He's saying something about dropping me... at the company stop and returning the scooter. This is the one right? Yeah. Give me the helmet. Please don't return it without any petrol. Sheesh! Would anyone do such a thing? If the petrol finishes, I'll leave it at that point. Okay? E E He was pestering her! A a Hope he's not out to rob someone. You should try talking to Kunjumon again. You know how many times I've tried! Remember what he told Kunjumon the last time? That was a while back. He's probably changed his mind. Let's leave it to chance. May be his is the right path. This is the house. A E Em H They won't feel free to talk with me around. A a I've sent him in. I'll wait outside. Okay, Okay- Parameswara Panickar Sir? My father's not well. Is it about the elephant? A a - He's been taken for a bath. - Will it be long? No! no! Are the documents all clear? - My father is up-to-date. - Do you have a micro chip? Everything except a pollution certificate. Take a look at the elephant first. We'll discuss all this later. Come on! Here. This is our guy! Can I take a photo? Yeah you can... but be careful. Smile! Shake your tusk and smile! Dad bought him at an auction from the forest department when he was two. He has been with us ever since then. Has caused us lots of trouble. Rig ht, Rajes n? We're both the same age. Rajesh, tell him about his qualities. Go Com e. He is very gracious. Look at his body! Look at how long the trunk is. Come touch the trunk and see! So, what are you expecting? Nothing less than 85. It's in great demand. How is he? Calm? He has behaved well for some time now. Very gentle. Hows he othenNise? He has chewed up three people. - Chewed up? - Sorry! Stamped and killed. I don't beat or correct him any more. He's scared of even my shadow! - He's killed three people? - That was 15 years ago. So what? What's his name? Chunkapura Raghavan. Haven't you heard of him? Yeah... I know people who would agree for 50 or 60. But I've already said.. We won't give him for less than 85. We expect 90 though. This elephant is quite unique. Rajesh, go chain him. Are you done? Yeah! Follow me. Follow me like my shadow. Sit down. I'll try my best. But I don't think anyone would agree to your price. But it is worth that price. You just saw it. Yeah... People also look into an elephant's history. An elephant's price is not decided based on that. - People will look into everything. - No one looks into these things. I'll try anyWaV- You'll have to pay a service charge now. Just Rs.500. After the sale, you'll have to pay us a 2% commission. - Only if we get that price. - Whatever the price be. If the sale happens through us you'll have to pay us 2%. That's how it works. What about the elephant's accessories? - What do you mean? - I mean, the elephant's accessories. Only the chain and the rope. That's all. What about the Mahout's tools? The hook, the knife and the like? Clients will ask me. That's why. What about the forehead-ornament... ...the ornamental fan and all? But that's all rented! Oh yeah, okay... I was just asking. Just in case... a Em He's down with a viral fever. That's why he isn't here. I need to buy some lime and jaggery. I'm very hungry- - When's the next festival? - The season's over. The elephant-festival's are coming up. Some inaugurations too. Oh God! 500 Rs. Proceed only if the price is ok. We're not in a hurry. We're in a hurry. Shouldn't delay such things! Am I right? 0k then. Sir! - Are you going to buy this elephant? -Why? - Do you really need to? - Why not? It's not good to keep at home. What do you mean? Soon after it was brought here, Sir died of a heart-attack. - Which Sir are you talking about? - That girl's father. Girl? The girl you spoke to now. I'm talking about her father. But... she said her father was lying inside with fever. She's lying. There is no one there. She's all alone. I know it. But she said that the elephant is registered in her father's name. Sir, there's no elephant there. It's not an elephant. It's just a soul. Who? Raghavan? Could you hear the chain's sound when he walked? Think about it. You won't hear it. You can't hear it. A E I'm telling you the truth. I'm sure about it. There are many things that we don't understand in life. We won't understand when we're alive. Even I understood only after death. - After whose death? - My death! - Let me go. - I'm also coming. Sir, Sir... Can I tell you something. I want to tell you something. Sir! Stop there, Sir. Stop, elephant! Stop elephant, elephant! Hello...! Who's it? - Isn't this Sibi's house? -Yes. - Can you please call him? - He's not here. Is he in town? It's been two days since he left. Are you his father? Yeah. Where are you from? Who's it? They've come to see Sibi. Hey! Shucks! Is this your wife? Your daughter works at Star Computers? Is this a cross-examination? I told you Sibi is not here. - I've understood. - Then please leave. Tell him that lsmu had come. Tell him the name correctly. Tell it correctly. Look at me. So what's my name? Say it. Won't you say it? Ism u. Say it. Em a Yeah... when your son returns, tell him this correctly. Dude, these guys are from the underworld. Was he insane to borrow money from them? It's not a small amount. He has borrowed 1 lakh. Plus there's interest. Does he know they went home? Ails E - ls his father taking it to the police? - That's what he says. Anyway the police won't do a thing. - He won't listen. - Does he know what it's about? He knows something's wrong. That's all. I'll call you back. Someone's at the door. A a Oh that! They mistook me for someone else. lsmu called and apologized profusely. - That's not what people are saying. - Who are these people? Your father is planning to take it to the police. Have you called home? Everyone's frightened. These guys are trouble. I'm telling you. Why do you mix with them? You better try getting out of it. They'll come for you again. It could then be worse than this. So... - So? - Do something quickly. There's only one thing to do. Return the money. I don't have it. That's the problem. Next they'll go for your sister. No. They won't. I know how these guys operate. We have recovery teams in our bank. I deal with them everyday. They'll stop at nothing to get their money back. - What's to be done? - Depends on you. What do you think the unden/vorld will do to me? I'm leaving. Going home? No. I don't feel like it. Then why the hell are you going? I need to. Do you have enough money? Do you want some? Why? Do you have more-than-enough? Don't talk nonsense! Do you want some money or not? Dude, everyone needs money. That's all? I thought you were getting me out of debt. You better get out of debt soon... or you'll be working in your old age. Haven't worked now... forget about old age. I'll call you. Selling an elephant is not easy. We're not good at it it. I've enquired thoroughly. There are people who will help. They'll take care of everything. We needn't worry. Son, don't teach the Pope how to give communion! Please help me. I need the money. Please help. You won't make any money unless the sale happens. I can't do it. Look for someone else. {mm a - Let me come there? - Why would you come here? - I'll tell you once I come. - Tell me what the matter is. I'll tell you once I come. Why can't you tell me on the phone? It'll be clearer if I come there. Everything is quite clear. There's no confusion. Please Bhai... What is it you want? I want to meet you now. Why are you putting on such airs? - Come over then. - I'm coming right away. Don't vanish. Okay. What's to come will come even If we lay a trap on the way. {mm} a who? The guy who showed us the gem's photo? Yeah. Didn't we pay him off that day? Well... - Did he approach us... or? - He approached us. Anyway we do need help there. This guy is sure to stay for a while. That we can't be sure of! He's in a soup. He will stay. - Is it? - Yeah. An old house in the midst of a thick forest. No people around, no phone and no electricity. Do you have the guts to stay there alone? Alone? Well not completely alone. What if you have some company there? I'm not scared. That's what I'm saying. You won't be completely alone. Assume there's another person there. Where's this place, Sir? We bought it recently. It was a well maintained plantation. From the time of the king. Mlam ade Palace. It's completely run down now. It needs restoring. Can you do it? I'll do it, Sir. Who's that calling? Stalin. He's calling for the raft. I was hoping you guys were here. - There's no use sticking around here. - Why? Not enough fish? Hardly any. - Don't you have another oar? - It's 0k. I'll row. Hey, I hope there's some rice to eat? I'm starving. Been eating this for two days now. I'm out of grain. What's that? We've been in Pullumala for the last 10-12 days. A a He brought two foreigners. They had two guns and two porters. Six people including me. They wanted deer-meat but we could get only this beef. We roasted it. They took most of it. The rest we threw in the forest. The other day wild dogs caught a deer here. And? We chased the dogs away and grabbed the deer's leg. - You should've taken it all. - One leg is more than enough for us. We left some for the dogs. No wonder you guys never prosper. - Hey Naayo, what's up? - Nothing much. Oh God! Who's this? What happened? It's Balan. Something bit him in the forest. His whole body was itching. We've applied medicine. The itching won't subside if he sits like this. We've put a leaf paste. He needs to sweat it out. He'll be alright when the poison subsides. - Balan, is the poison subsiding? - I'm fine. Get well soon! I've brought you all something. Give me a little and take the rest. - What's this? - Some beef. Beef? No, no. We'll be in trouble if someone finds out. - They're waiting for a reason. - But no one will come this way. Can never say. Please take this away. Alright then. Nothing good is meant for your lot, anyway. Hey Karma, give me some rice. Could you take me to Mlamade Palace? Thankacha, do you want to go to Mlamade? Why don't you go? - I don't have a spare-tyre. - If you're lazy, just say so. He'll take you, Sir. - How much is it to Mlamade palace? - It's just called a Palace. It's a bad road. Will cost you 600 bucks. - How many kms from here? - We don't calculate by kms. It's a reasonable rate. (mp a Then get in. Sir... This is the palace. Pillecha, you have a guest. Pillecha! Pillechan! Pillecha! - Isn't he here? - He must be somewhere around. Must have gone to Cheenkannipara to buy stuff. Where's that? Where you came from... that's "Cheenkannipara city". - But we didn't see him on the way. - He probably walked through the forest. A a So Pillechan doesn't know that you're coming? No. Don't worry. He'll be back soon. I'm off. Wait. Does he have a mobile phone? I don't know Don't worry, Sir. I'll send him back quickly if I see him. Shall I leave then? I think I'll also come with you. What if he doesn't come back? We don't know. What if he comes back while we're on the way? That's what I meant. Sir, what should I do? I'll also come along. And? I'll stay in a lodge tonight and come back tomorrow The only Lodge is at Pothupara or at Mallipetti near Tamil Nadu. - Isn't there a lodge in Cheenkannipara? - Who comes here, Sir? Shall I leave then? Ok Sir. Hey please give me your mobile number. 9-4-4-7-8-2-7-1 -O-8 a a Alright then. Sir! Look who's here! Where were you? He was about to leave. - Who's that? - Don't you know? Who's Balan Pillai? Me. Then who's Pillechan? That's also me. Who are you, Sir? I'll tell you. But get me a cup of tea first. Don't you have any manners. Pick up my b39- I already knew about the transfer of property. But I didn't know that I'd been sold along with the property. Have you understood what's written in that document? E EEK; Do you have any doubts? Even if I have, I can ask you. You're going to be around. Can we get some workers here? To do what? To clean up this place. It can't remain dirty like this. I'll cleanup a room for you to sleep in. We don't need anyone for cleaning. After all, I've looked after this place alone all these years. - Will you have gruel tonight? - Why? Do you have it every night? It's easy to cook. That's why. You didn't inform me that you're coming. I would've cooked something nice. How is that possible? Think about it. I myself would've had to come and tell you! That's the problem. We're so cut off from the outside world. Is this teak? Yes, teak. It's damn costly. See, all this is teak. My goodness! It's all teak! How long have you been here? Swami's father brought me here as a kid. Would be about 60 years ago. That's a long time! I've been through a lot. But I somehow made it till here. The money dried up after Swami took ill. His children don't bother. There's been no electricity for 2 years. They don't even send me enough money to pay the bills. You must have seen those weak tea plants outside. I survive with the money I get from selling them. - Who do you have at home? - Right now it's only myself and you, Sir. Dinner's ready. Tell me when it's time to serve. So early? Are you hungry? A a Why are you standing there? I usually don't step out after dark. Why's that? Just... -it's surrounded by forest, right? - Yeah dense forest. It's a historical forest. I'll take you for a walk around in the morning. Do you get to see elephants and tigers here? Yeah we do. They don't bother us. But it's not the animals that we should fear. Then what should we fear? Lots of things! A lot of blood has been shed in this place. You'll understand slowly. El Wflflaflm El - Do you know why I've come here? - You've told me. The plan is to restore this place and... make it hospitable for people to come and stay and see the forest. Our guests are happy! And we make our money! - Do you understand? -Yeah. If you spread these scary stories, business will be affected. That's not what I meant. The story is well known around here. It's not only me. Whose blood? What are you talking about? Long ago, when Tipu's army was entering, our king needed to hide his gold and other possessions. He struck a deal with Madurai Nayakkar, to move 101 loads of gold to Tamil Nadu. The plan was to carry it through this forest. The journey is 4-5 days by foot. 101 tribals, porters and some soldiers set off. Not one was seen after that. Legend goes, that the porters were beheaded, &the gold hidden in the forest. The ones who beheaded the tribals also disappeared. - So what about the gold? - They say it's in the forest. 101 loads of gold! That's hell of a lot. Anyway it's just a story! The numbers can be as we please. No, this is not just a story. There's historical evidence. Find out if you want to. What's this place? Thalakaani. Even if it were true, someone must have taken away the gold long time ago. No one has touched it. It's still there. You mean, It's still lying there after all these years? Lots of people have gone looking. E- a The treasure is guarded even today. - By whom? -101 headless tribals. That's why it's called Thalakaani. Get me some water, Balan Pillai. Balan Pillai!!! - What happened, Sir? - Where were you? I was making your bed. What happened, Sir? I wanted some water. Anyway, never mind. It's very cold outside. I'll sit inside. Pillecha! - Isn't Pillechan here? - No. Anything urgent? No. I just dropped in while passing by. He'll be late. Thankachan told me about you. I live near Cheenkannipara. The name is Stalin. You're starting a resort here? A Em I'm willing to take people around the forest. We're not starting a resort. Just something small. No on knows about this place. People will flow in if they know. - What do you do, Stalin? - I don't have a permanent job. But you said you take people around the forest. I was brought up here. Sol know the place well. We live depending on the forest. Let me know when you're free. We'll take a walk around. The scenery around here is great for photography. Do you have a camera? Em a There's no signal for my phone here. Balan Pillai walked me up the mountains and still no signal. What connection do you have? Is it BSNL? - IDEA. - Pillechan has no idea. You need to go on top of that mountain. You'll get signal there. Do you want to go now? I'll take you. There's no electricity. I haven't charged my phone. Here, put your sim card into my phone. It's fully charged. It's old But very clear. Do one thing, write everything down on a piece of paper. When the MD comes, you can tell him directly. I'm noting down everything. I'm not asking for too much. But at least 2-3 people should be able to stay here. The bathroom is a problem. And the electricity. The MD will be here after the 8th. Call me if you need anything before that. I've been trying to call you since I got here. - There's no signal. - How did you get signal now? By luck. - Go to Muthalapara and call. - Not Muthalappara. Cheenkannipara. Have to walk 2 hours to get there. A a I'll take care of it. What about this month's salary? - Hello... - Hello! A a - It's gone. - Gone! You lost signal? - I'm glad I could talk. - Are you done? Yeah. The signal comes from there. It is lost very easily. Is that Tamil Nadu? That's all Tamil Nadu. One can reach Tamil Nadu through the forest, that way. It a 3-4 day walk. A Em - Is it? - Yeah. - Have you been there? - I've been to every forest here. - Why do you go? - People have different needs. - Do you want to go? - I don't want to go without a reason. It's easy here. The Forest department doesn't bother us. - What can they do? - They don't permit anyone in. A a That's not a problem here. We can go where we want. Can we go to Thalakaani? Haven't you heard of it? Thalakaani? It's true. He has been to every forest. - But... - But what? Eta a His mother, Thookkupalam Thankamani is quite famous around these pans. But no one knows who his father is. How can that be his fault? I was just saying. Done? I've had enough. Balan Pillai... I casually asked Stalin about Thalakaani. - What did he say? - He seemed uninterested. That's what I said. No one goes there. He's pretending to be scared. He changed his mind as soon as he realized that it won't work with me. Now he's willing to go anytime. A a You're new here. What if he takes you to some mountaintop and say it's Thalakaani. You'll have to believe it. It's not a place for men to go. Why would you want to go there? I want to see if your stories are true. Why would I lie? So there's a lot of gold in Thalakaani. Why not go and see? Remember, you're not the first one to get this idea. People have tried before. I personally know of an incident. Didn't want to scare you with these stories. Success comes only after a series of failure, right? Even a tiger makes a kill only after trying and failing ten times. I was talking about human beings. Tell me when it's time for dinner. Tipu died in the year 973. We've got a palm leaf from 3 years before that. In 970. It clearly states that grain for 101 soldiers and porters, will be sent to a nearby temple, and was not to be used by anyone else. Are you a Hindu? No, no. Shucks! You're not allowed to enter the temple. I could've showed you the leaf. It's still there. So it's a true story. Yeah. So is the treasure still there? The gold was safely carried from here. We have proof. But it didn't reach anywhere. So we can be sure that it was lost in the forest. Is the story about Thalakaani true? Tribals tell that story. It must be true. It's where their ancestors were betrayed and murdered. They still don't go there. They don't even utter the name. It's completely forbidden! I'm sure something big happened there. - Many people died. - Have you been there? Why do you want to go? You're not interested in this, are you? - Intesrseted in what? - The treasure in the forest. What if it's true? I don't have such desires. Nonsense! Everyone has desires. They just don't say it! I'm happy as I am. I don't want anything more. Balan Chetta! What a pleasant surprise! Where are you coming from? I was wandering about here, so thought of coming and visiting you. Who is that? He's our new manager. Manager? But why? Someone else bought this place recently. When Swami passed away, his children sold it. - When did Swami pass away? - It's over a year now. So I've to get his permission to stay here now? Don't worry. Come. It's alright. Come on dear. Come. She's an old guest. Hi, I'm Sameera. I come here often. I guessed, when you barged in. My name is Sibi. I didn't know about the changes. That's why. I'm sorry. That's alright. You're our first guest. Right, Balan Pillai? Balan Chet-ta, there are some groceries in the vehicle. EM a My plan is to renovate and restore this place. You'll have to put up with it this one more time. There'll be more facilities the next time you visit. That means I'll have to pay next time. You needn't pay this time. Where will she sleep? She used to sleep in the room you're using now. - But you've taken it now. - Then I'll move out. That's not necessary, Sir. She's not bothered. She'll sleep anywhere. There's a lot of space here. She won't be here for long. Please ask her if she needs the room. Forget it. You needn't move from there. I knew you would be a photographer. - I'm not a photographer. - Really? I'm neither a photographer nor a researcher nor a scientist. Don't worry. So you're just a nature lover like me. No. Then? I am a... Jungle junkee! - Can hear the elephants.. -Where? Outside? Yeah... somewhere on the opposite mountain. Yeah. It was a distant sound. Wow! This is cool. Everything sounds different. Do you hear something? Not really. What did you say earlier? Jungee... junglee? Does it mean you go into the forest? Sheesh! I was just kidding. I really wish to go to the forest. What's the big deal? You can go anytime. But I need someone with me. E a How about putting in an Ad in a newspaper asking for a companion. You're sure to find someone. My goodness! Are you going to sleep here? - I love it here. - No. No. You should sleep inside. - Don't be scared. - I'm not scared. There's a lot of room inside. Don't sleep alone. Hey! Wait! Wait, Wait! Are you worried because I'm sleeping alone? Then you sleep here too. I have one more sleeping bag. Do you want it? We can look up at the sky and stars and sleep. Do you want to sleep here? I don't want you to sleep alone. Okay. I'll just tell Balan Pilla and come. Get me some water. We're sleeping outside. Just for fun. It'll be very cold outside. You go to sleep. Just shut the door, don't lock it. Okay. - Are there mosquitos? - We won't feel it because we're outside. - Here! Rub this on. - No, mosquitoes don't bite me. They bite you. But you don't know it. Is this the first time you're sleeping outside? I've slept on the church ground during festival. Where's your church? Pflga RC church "m Pam. Do you know W? No, no. I was just asking. A Em Of course. I'm hoping you'll hep me. We need a USP. We should give the guests a new experience. We're aiming at high-end clients. We'll charge them 10,000 and above. But there should be good facilities. We're looking for foreigners. They should feel adventurous. We'll take them trekking, and bird watching. They'll be happy. That's the plan. I hope you'll help me. Hey! I hope you'll help me. Hmm... - What happened, Sir? - You've not gone to bed? I warned you it will be cold outside. She's used to it. But you're not. I came to tell you something. You need to go to Cheenkannipara. Just tell me when to go. Okay? Ok. Pillecha! Has the resort been named? Don't come there using my name. I know you're coming to see him. - You want to give me a bad name? - I thought I'd give you some publicity. Things are going well now. You needn't come there for the sake of my publicity. Why are you angry with me? As if I've made a big mistake. Look I've to shave my beard before Chand ran closes shop. But he doesn't open his shop on Tuesdays. Today's Tuesday? Yesterday was Monday. So today is Tuesday. Have you set out to ruin my day? You'll tire yourself out walking up to there! Getting in my way unnecessarily! When I know today's a beautiful Wednesday. Trouble-maker! Drink it while it's warm. You'll feel better after you sweat. You're not used to sleeping in the cold. - Aren't you going to Cheenkannipara? - I've already been. - Did you do it? - Do what? - Then why did you go? - You asked me to go. I had a shave as well. Take this too. Sleep for a while more. Take one more tablet after lunch. He's not fit for these things. He's planning to go to Thalakaani. I didn't want to tell you. A Em Even I told him. There's a reckless guy nearby. He's the one who's persuaded him. If he asks you, tell him that you don't know anything. Let's also not talk about it. He looks like a harmless guy. May be. He's ambitious. But not capable of anything. Look at him lying there. Some people are like that. "Far off In a dark-blue land" "Does honey drip from the nightingale's song?"

"Those interested in traveling in a forest kindly contact." "Young people with forest travel experience will be considered" "Apply by e-mail with a photograph" Show me. I would apply if you put an ad. Why don't you try? - I was just kidding that day. - Alright then! Hey” Are you serious about it? You crack a lot of jokes. What does this mean? Call me Sameera. Tell me. Sameera, are you serious or just teasing me? What do you think? I'd like to go. A a It's a dense forest. Have you heard of Thalakaani? Shhhhh! Come here. Spotted deer. It's the first time I'm seeing them here. Wilma It's a good omen. - Have you heard of Mareejan? - Who's that? A a Spotted deer are also called Mareejan. It's from the Ramayanam. Haven't you heard of it? Balan Chetta, where is Thalakaani? I haven't been there. It's far away. No one goes there, dear. I like going to places where no one goes. Sameera! Another Mareejan! It'll take us 3 days to get to Paandipath. After camping there we can go anywhere we want. - How far is Thalakaani from Paandipath? - Not very far. - Then let's camp out at Thalakaani. - No Sir. Paandipath is a better place to spend the night. - Water is easily available there. - We need water. That's what I'm saying. So that's 6 days to and fro. You decide how many more days you want to stay. We can't say that without seeing the place. - Approximately? - Approximately... 5-6 days. We'll have to carry food. We'll buy everything. Don't worry. Things can be bought. But how will we carry it all? I knowa boy. We'll take him along. - I don't want many people. - We need people. It's hard to carry such a load. There won't be anyone to help in the forest. - Who's the boy? - He stays nearby. Do we need to carry all this? Won't we get anything in the forest? - If you have a gun. - That's not what I meant. - What about fruits or vegetables? -You'll know when you get there. There forest holds everything. But nothing's within our reach. Forget it. Howmuch grain do you think we'll need? Five people, about 1 kg per meal. That'll be a lot. - There's something else we need too. - What? - Money! - Yeah... [mm mm“ Who's this lady? Sir, I've somehow convinced her. She's an accredited international scout for nature tourism. Scout? She discovers tourist spots and tells tourist companies. If she writes on the internet there'll be no stopping the tourists. It will benefit us. - But why do you need 25 thousand? - It will cost that much. We should have an idea about the money. The sleeping bags and tents that we buy now can be used again. So it's as an investment. We need to pay a guide, porters... It will cost that much. - Is there any chance? - That I'll have to ask her. Shucks! That's not what I meant. Will it reach people through the internet? A EEK! Come here! Hope you're not planning to chill out at our expense. - Never. - Okay. Fl fl fl 2% Wm Q5; Wm fl 2% This is 25. That's what you asked for. A a You don't want it? Note it down in my account. I'll collect it later. No. No. You must keep it. Get off with you. Playing around! - Whom is this medicine for? - Your mom is sick. She was at Pulikkan's for a week. There's a lot of medicine. Isn't it available there? It's cheaper here. Then you should've asked Anumol to come. - She has to go to work. - Then you should've asked Santhosh. He is busy with his wedding. Moreover he's not the one who should be doing all this. I'll come back after two days. Someone came home looking for you again. Who? lsmu? I returned his money. - How much did you give him? - Forget it. Let that not keep you away now. I'll come. Carry on! Don't waste your time. We could drop him if he's going in the same direction. No. He's going another way. Let's go. Siby, when did you join Mlamade? 12th of last month. Where were you working before that? Before that...

Exhausted! Let's climb this last mountain. We're almost there. I want to rest for 5 minutes. It's only a small distance away. There's a good place to sit down over there. Why, will we get chairs over there? No. After this mountain, it's downhill. - I'm scared to see a downhill walk. -Why? We'll have to climb up on the way back. No, there are other ways to get back. That doesn't matter. All downhills have uphills. Em Em There's a lot of time. Hey, give me some water. - Howmuch longer? - Only Stalin Chet-tan knows. Comrade Stalin! Come here. How much longer to Paandipath from here? You've been making us walk for a long time. Look there. Do you see that fork in the hill? Paandipath is rig ht below it. Stalin! A a How far is Thalakaani from here? We need to set up things here first. Yeah right. I was just wondering. We should gather some firewood. Sure. By then we'll set things up here. Hey come on! Carry that axe too. - Where are you going? - I'll just be back. - I'll come with you. - Sheesh! Don't be shameful! They sound as if they are chopping down the entire forest? Leave it to them. Hows he? Our comrade. What do you think? Nothing much. He doesn't reveal very much. Seems secretive about everything. He's not the only one who is secretive. That's okay. Everyone has their own interests. What do you mean? You never told me about the treasure. How did you come to know? I know it. I didn't want to scare you by talking about it. I thought I'd tell you after we got here. I wasn't sure what you'd think. That's why. I never meant to hide anything. Sorry. It's not nice when you come to know of things through other people. That's what I meant. Does Stalin know? Yes. Don't worry. I'll deal with him. Don't forget. We need his help for everything. Emmy But if you'd told me earlier, we could've organized one or two other things. - Like what? - No use talking about it now. - Tell me what it is. - It's a waste of time. 0k, forget it then. If we all try sincerely, It will work out. Am I right? Let's see. - I've heard such stories before. - But this is different. A a Aaramkallu Murugan. That's how he lost his mind. - Where's he now? - He put his head under a train. He was kept in a mortuary for a week without a head. - Where did his head go? - No one knows. No one could recognize him. So they buried him there itself. Then howdid they know it's him? People know. - Are you scared? - Scared of what? Are you scared by such stories? I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Karma, are you scared? The only person he is scared of is Stalin. No way! He's not what you think. We leave for Thalakaani in the morning, right? Yeah. How long does it take from here? Thalakaani is not one particular place. The whole area is called Thalakaani. I see! Do we really need to return by nightfall? Of course we have to. Let's forget about everything. If we don't find the treasure we'll look at it as a fun trip in the forest. Hard to say. Luck matters. No one's found it till now. That's why we're trying. Why would we try if someone else had found it. How many crores do you think it's worth? Anyway you mark my words. We won't leave this forest empty-handed. That treasure is written in my stars. Shall we go? It's an inauspicious time now. Wait till 7.30. At least eat. There's no good or bad time for that. LN} \ \ \ I\ ! This is for lunch. Where are the eggs? Em a - You didn't tell me. - Have you to be told everything? - You're staying back here, right? - Let him also come. He has certain beliefs. We can't force him to come. What's his problem? His folks don't go to Thalakaani. They say people are transformed when they return from there. Is this true? Yeah. Let him stay back. It's good to have someone here. Rig ht? A E There's nothing to be scared of. We'll be back by evening. Do you know anyone who has transformed? Leave him alone. Everyone has their own beliefs like yours in inauspicious time. Take a look. Did you see something? Not there. Look here. What's that? We can see something there. That's an Ubb. - An Ubb? -Yeah. Like a cave. There are so many. Shall we go and see? Let me take a look. What the hell is he saying? It's a bear's den! - Did you see the bear? - It's inside. Will it come outside? We can't be sure, Sir. It's a senseless animal. Let's not stand here. Let's go. Sameera! Listen to me. It's dangerous. Shh... Don't make such a noise. It probably won't come out till nightfall. Then why are we standing here? Come let's go. Come! Why are you panicking? We don't get to see bears everyday. Why would you want to see a bear everyday? Anyway, have we come here to see a bear? A a Let's go find the treasure. The bear can wait. Let's leave. Sameera, hurry up! Stalin. Stalin! Stalin! - What's that noise? - What noise? It's coming from nearby. Is it a bear? Bears won't come as long as the fire's burning. Let's add some more firewood? This will do. It will last till morning. Siby, go to sleep for God's sake! I heard a strange noise. Did you hear it? Or, was it just a feeling? Afeeling for no reason? You better watch out. Where are they? A E What do you do here alone during the day? Nothing. Heard that you got into a bear's den yesterday? Yeah. Luckily we escaped. I heard a noise last night. Was it a bear? - That's not a bear. - Did you hear it also? Yeah. What was it? I don't know. It's sometimes heard at night. Don't you know what it is? - Could it be an owl? - No. No one knows what it is. What could it be? It sounded like breath right? Yeah! What's that? Kaattumooli. Sameera! I'm sure we came this way yesterday. - Is it? - Yes! Ask him, Sameera. Why don't you ask? I'll ask. Stalin! Didn't we come this way yesterday? There are some places left to see around here. Why didn't you show them to us yesterday? You decided to go to the Bear's den. We should search this place thoroughly. This is a good sign. Exactly what I said. I don't think it has anything to do with the treasure. Why? According to the story, the gold was hidden during the time of Tipu Sultan. That is not so long back. About 200 years ago maybe. These are at least 5000 years old. So? So there's no connection. I don't get your logic. Think about it. There are other places too. A a Many more places around here! You're sure to like them. So you've come here before? I haven't come here. I've come nearby. What do you mean you didn't come here? Why are you taking us to places when you know there's nothing? But I've never come here looking for a treasure. Then? It's a forest. There are lots of reasons. What are we here for now? We all know. Why do you keep asking? You once said you don't like going to places where everyone goes. But that's exactly what we're doing now. - Didn't he like the place? - Doesn't matter. What's the problem? Come, I'll tell you. What's the point in going to the same place everyday? He says that's the only way to Thalakaani. Only one way? I doubt it. We have to believe him if he says so. Why does he want us back here every night? He told us that in the beginning. How stupid! Is this the only place in the forest with water? Balan Pillai already warned me about him. Balan Pillai warned us of many other things as well. Why don't you talk to him? Let's shift to another place. Ea a Kannan refuses to come there. My dear Sameera, they're cooking up stories! That's it! It's time to return. There's still time left. We only need to get back before nightfall. That's not the point. We need to find a way out. - It won't work othen/vise. - You tell me. You should talk to Kannan. We can't do everything according to his convenience. Can we go without Kannan? Let him stay here. It's only a matter of 2-3 days. We can't leave him alone at night. That's different. You shouldn't have brought him in the first place. I had told you earlier. Thalakaani is not for the night. Whatever! Let's do one thing. Let's split into two. And? Two of us will go. And one of us will stay with Kannan. How'? Eitherl stay with Kannan or you stay. Let Stalin stay here. We'll go. That's not possible. We need Stalin. I don't mind staying here. Do you want me to go? Stay here if you want to rest. Kannan will take care of you. I'll go and come. Please ask him once more. What if he agrees to come. Don't ask him again. He won't come. Then I'll go. You stay here. It's better that I go. I don't want you to go alone. I won't be alone. There's Stalin. No, Sameera! I'll go. Are you ready? We'll go. - Are you sure? - Of course! - It's better that I go. - I'm not sure about that. I wanted you to come. But it's alright. I'll go. He's so excited. Is there any fish? - Did they ask you anything? -Yeah. What did they ask? She asked me if I could go to Thalakaani. A E Then what did she say? She said it's ok if I'm scared. Someone will stay with me. I wouldn't have come if you'd told me earlier. That's why I didn't tell you. When are we going back? We'll go after showing him a few more places. We'll be out of food by then. - There's a lot of grain left. - Don't you worry. We'll finish it. Tell them you're also scared. Why do you want to go there for nothing? - It's not for nothing. - This is all for nothing. It's your people that talk about the treasure. That may be true. But no one can get it. Our ancestors guard it even today. They'll rob us off our Souls if we go there. We'll return hollow men. - Who told you this? - Kaali Uncle. Must be some truth in it! It's ok. He's not as bad as you think. That's not the problem. I wish you were with me. When you find the treasure, don't forget my share, okay? Don't tease me. I might even find it. Have you read 'The Alchemist'? No. Why? It's about a man who goes in search of a treasure. And, does he find it? I won't reveal the end. He must not have found it. That's why you thought of it now. A a There's a Mist in the story. What's that? He discovers something when he reaches his destination after a long journey. What? That the treasure lay where his journey began. Hey, take care of her. We're going to have a terrific time after you go. Right? Alright then. Bring us something special when you come back. One more thing... Mark your path so that you don't forget the way. Take some photos too. Relax. Don't risk your life for anything. No treasure is worth your life. - When will they come back? - Leave it to them. They might come tomorrow How do you know? - Did Stalin tell you anything? - No. What will we do if they come back with hollow bodies? It's a bison! Costs 600 Rs. A kilo. - We're looking for... - Shhh! What we're looking for costs 25 Lakh Rs per kilo. Let's leave this and look for that treasure. Who did you say saw the treasure? - Aaramkallu Murugan. - Where did he see it? I don't know. Could be in a cave. They're usually good to hide things. I'm sure it will be in a totally unexpected place! Do you have any expectations? What kind of a question is that? Sometimes I feel you're not serious about it. How can we not be serious? We're risking our lives. Really? I'm not joking. You'll realize yourself soon. Au nty ! Don't worry. I've known her since I was a kid. Why are you blocking the way? We need to cross. Come on, move out. Run! Stalin, why the hell did you do that? She's harmless, Sir. Just playing around. Did you get scared? Let's go. Come on, Sir. Are you tired? Do you have more water? I have some. Stalim! Look at this! Do you understand? A a - A knife? - No, a sword! It's a pan of an ancient sword. Look at it! We needn't go anywhere else! We have arrived at our destination! We're lucky! Or else we wouldn't find it here. This is awesome!! We needn't look back again. Let's praise Aaramkallu Murugan and get moving! Sir... let's go. Go where? This is the place! You still don't believe me? Listen. We'll stay here. We can't stay here. - There's a reason. Try and understand! - I have a reason too. I don't care. We'll stay here today. Stalin! Where are you going? We need water and firewood. It's an elephant! Run! Stalin! Comrade... When are we going back? We're not in any hurry. Let them return first. It's because of you. I would've gone with them othen/vise. - Did you want to go? - Of course! I'm not scared like you. I thought you didn't want to go. Should we look for them? It's been so long. Sum! Oh Siby! You scared the hell out of us! Come on. Drink! Stalin... Comrade! Hope you remember the way to Thalakaani. Somewhat. Stalin knows. No, I'm asking if you know the way. What's the matter? Stalin won't come again. He wants to leave in the morning. How's that possible? How can we leave when everything has just fallen into place? Leave it! There's no point discussing it. Can I tell you something? Now we have a rough idea about everything. Next time we'll come with a proper plan. No confusion. What's the confusion now? They say they want to leave. Let them leave. We should also go with them. - Do you want to go? - What else can we do? We'll be out of food after tomorrow Do you know the way back? I don't know. How will we go back? Is that what you think? Yeah. Then you guys leave. I'll come later. Don't you understand? His plan is to get rid of us and take the gold. 5ibY--' Stalin does not have the guts. He said he'll never go there again. I'm not coming. You guys can leave. Why don't you understand? I understand your concerns. No you don't. You don't understand anything. That's why you talk like this. Can I sleep please? I didn't sleep a wink last night. Neither did I. He's lost his mind after finding that. Tell him to throw it away. Siby, it's extremely dangerous. Why can't you understand? We're not giving up. We'll come back soon. You won't be able to survive here alone. Come, let's go and come back. I can't come without finishing this, Sameera. I've been 'surviving' for too long now. But why? You might've forgotten. But I remember it clearly. You once asked me what I did before joining Mlamade. Remember? Shouldn't I be able to reply at least now. I don't want to say that I was just 'surviving'. I want to go. You guys leave! I'll come back. Can we wait for today and leave tomorrow? What if he changes his mind? I don't think he'll ever change his mind. You guys leave. I'll contact you after getting back. And... This... It's better to put it it back, rather than throw it away. Hey Karma, give me some water. No. Keep it. You lucky guy! You can now go home without being scared. - Where's your house? - AtAaramkallu Murugan's. So you knowAaramkallu Murugan? Aaramkallu Murugan... was my father. Sir! Where were you? Did you see my elephant? He goes missing in a flash. What happened, Sir? Work hard to get what you like. If you don't like to work hard you'll lose what you like. Shall I go? Rag hav! You look so tired. Did you get the treasure? Can you give me some water? Water only? Don't you want the treasure? Where can I get water? The treasure lies in the cave we're afraid to enter. Haven't you heard that? Do you want to try? Are you afraid? No. "The lightning sparkles, spills and scatters in the eyes" "The lightning sparkles, spills and scatters in the eyes" "To awaken living beings" "New paths appear before us" "New paths appear before us to swim across and reach beyond" "Do paths extend so much? Do paths fade so much?" "Do nights hurt so much? Do nights change so much?" "You wandered in yourself You realized yourself." "The tear drop kisses first When one is born" "It reaches oneself like a passing breeze, And slips before anyone sees" - Which is the way to Cheenkannipara? - Cheenkannipara? It's in Kerala. A a There's a bus at 10.15. Take that. How much should I pay you? We've to take a permit at the check-post. It'll be 3000 Rs. Will you take this? Will you take this?
