Give me the backpack! I can’t wait. Let’s find a solution. Until we perform an autopsy… Until all procedures are completed and recorded, we can’t release the body. What autopsy? He died in war. What else do you need to know? I need… to get back to Crimea. Wait in the hall, the certificate will be ready in half an hour, then you can take the body. Tell me… Are there any options to transport him properly? He'll be in a zinc coffin anyway. No, no, I don’t want that. Do as you like. Just a couple of injections, and you’ll have time to transport him. Put them on the table. Put them on the table! Alim, help. Will you transport him like this? We’ll figure it out on the way. The service is good and cheap here. Thank you. Get in the car. Give me that. Where to now? Home. HOMEWARD Dad, look. This is my university. I need to tell them I’ll be gone for a while. When can I come back? Three days after the funeral, then seven more, then thirty-seven, then forty. Then the mourning is over. I won’t miss anything important in a week. What do you study? Journalism. Can you at least write? It’s difficult, but Olesya helps me with the language and stuff. Have you started to speak Ukrainian? Yes. I’m getting pretty good at it. Alim! This is Mustafa. My father. Olesya, Nazim’s fiancée. Good afternoon. Hello. Come in. Pick up your stuff. I'm sorry I look terrible. And this mess… It’s a pity Nazim didn’t introduce us. This is so messed up. Maybe you’d like tea or coffee? I’ve got pasta, but it’s cold. Coffee. Have a seat, I’ll be back. The soldiers who perished in the course of the ATO, are being transported to the Ukrainian capital. In the last few days, over 130 bodies were taken to the city morgue, mainly soldiers of the volunteer battalions. Ninety percent of the deceased are impossible to identify at least visually, so the remains are being sent for examination either in Kyiv or at the forensic center in Zaporizhzhia. The process may take weeks, and there’s no room for new bodies that keep arriving, which have to be taken to morgues of Berdiansk, Melitopol and other local cities. Employees are complaining about the lack of equipment. The Head of the Forensic Medical Examination Bureau, has already addressed the government… Where is the Quran? I don’t know. Where’s Nazim’s Quran? What? The book in Arabic… In a case. It was here somewhere. Wait. Here. You know, it’s a good thing you came so fast. I started taking care of the funeral, but couldn't work out what to do. This? There’s nothing for you to do. I’ll bury him tomorrow in Crimea. What do you mean, in Crimea? I’ve arranged a plot at the cemetery here. I’ll bury Nazim at home. Next to his mother’s grave. Fine. How much time do I have? I need to pack. You're not going anywhere. I am his wife. I’m his family. You're the reason he left his family. And not because of the war? If you hadn’t dragged him here, he would still be alive. Are you serious? Maybe I'm also the reason Alim ran away? Shut up! I don’t care what you think about me. I'm going with you! What happened? Let’s go. I'm not going without Olesya. What are you doing? Get up! Open the door! Open the door, you hear me? Open the door! To the left. Straight on. Left… No, I mean, right. Where now? Straight ahead. Can’t you explain it normally?! You do it then! Alim. Alim. The only person you have is me. Which way now? Straight ahead. It happens, don’t worry. Help me. Alim, I'm begging you, don't go anywhere with him. You hear me? Calm down. I’ll come back after we’ve buried him. Alim, listen, I'm very worried about you. I don’t know how, but I’ll bring you back, just hold on. Maybe you shouldn’t come? You’ll only make things worse. Worse?! I can’t even give my husband a decent burial! Don’t be afraid of anything, everything’s gonna be fine. I’ll never let him hurt you again. Just wait for me, okay? Okay, I can’t talk anymore. Open the door. Let’s pull over somewhere, get some rest. We need to be in Crimea by morning. You’ve been driving for two days. It’s okay, sleep if you want to. You’ll fall asleep. I’ll put on some music. You can’t listen to music during the mourning period. Who cares about that? I do! I care about that. It’s gonna be a long week. Week? Wasn’t I clear before? Three days, seven days, thirty-seven and forty. I have to go back to studying. There’s nothing for you there. I've already lost one son. What do you want? Me working with you on the farm my whole life? And who did I build the house for? Why did I work at the market at night? It wasn't for myself, it was for you! I don’t need it. Can you even imagine what we went through in order to return to Crimea? Do you know what it’s like to grow up where you are a stranger? They didn’t even think of us as people. To come back to Crimea we… No one gives a damn about Crimea. There’s no life there, and never will be. So what, run away like Nazim? You really think he ran away?! Enough! Don’t talk to her. I said don't talk to her! Give it back! Give it back! Sit still! Hold on, Alim. Are you hurt? Show me. Stop. Stop. Stop! Calm down. Stop! Come on, breathe! Alim! Come and help! Gas! Gas! Wait! Hit the brakes! Good job. Turn off the lights! Open the window. You smoke? It’s Nazim’s. Roll up the window. How did you do it? Do it again. Let’s nap for 30 minutes, then get moving. Sergeant Tarasov. Are you alright? Yes, we're fine. What’s back there? Where? In the coffin. Brother. And who’s this? Father. Be-ki-rov… Bekirov Mustafa Izzetovich. You should understand… I’m going to bury my son. I'm in a hurry. My condolences. I need to see papers for the body. They’re in the car. Check the documents for the body. Listen, nothing has happened. We really need to go. You’d better not do that. What are those? I don’t know. I found license plates with Russian numbers. Try living there without plates and a passport. You think it’s easy? Have the car serviced, or they’ll stop you at every checkpoint. Drive safely. I will. The collar's gone bad. We’ve got work here until the evening. It’s cost you two thousand. Deal. And… Don’t think less of me… It’s just… You have to pay up front. Give me my wallet. Here’s half. Do it quicker, you’ll get more. I have no reasons to keep you waiting. Where are you going? To the toilet. Hello. Where are you? We stopped to have the car fixed. What happened? We had a little crash. Oh my God! Are you all right? Yes. Fine. Thank God! I tell you, it’s dangerous to be with him. I’m on my way to Zaporizhzhya, I’ll take the train to the border from there. I hope I’ll make it. I’ll call you when I get there. Fine. Let me help you. Thanks. And you're like… Tatars? Yeah. Crimean Tatars. Ah! Actually… Crimea would be "white" if it wasn’t for Makhno. I used to like to go to Crimea. We went to Cape Fiolent Went on Ai-Petri. Mountains, sea… It was good time. I’ve dreamt of seeing the sea all my life. You’ve never seen it? No. Only to the river near here. The sea is different. How is it different? The way it smells… a bit salty. And you always feel when it’s near. Awesome. Do you want to go to the river? Not really. Why? Let’s go! It doesn’t smell like the sea does, but… I can’t. You're such a bore! Well I'm going to the river. Don’t tell Grandpa. Fine. Bye. I first thought he was a Tatar. It turns out, he told me, he’s Urum. He's one of those Greeks that lived in Bakhchysarai suburbs. Dad… The ones Suvorov later had deported to the Mariupol suburbs. Dad… And here’s what I think: Let the people live where they belong. I’m coming with you. Wow, what happened? There’s nothing to do there anyway. You’re telling me? There’s nothing to do at all here. Come on. No, seriously. I have no sea here, like you do. I don’t have it either. The closest I get is 100 km. Really? And you were raving about the smell… I'm not lying to you. Fine. Are you coming? Hi! Who’s that? This is Alim. My friend from Crimea. You have friends? Shut up! Alim! Come and help us! Alim! Hey! What’s with you? Are you crazy? Get off him! What are you doing? Let him go! Alim! Alim! Dad, I… Let’s go! Where have you been? Come here now! Grandpa! Come here, I said! Grandpa, help! Come here! Stop! Piss off! Don’t dare touch her! My son got mugged because of this brat! Go to the house! Stay there! Get lost, you and that sucker! Hey, not so fast. First you pay, then get the hell outta here! I said we got robbed. Our possessions and money were there. You trying to trick me? Look. Until I get paid, you won’t get your car or your stiff from the cellar. Got it? We just want to find our stuff. So go look for it. Let’s go. Dad! Forgive me. Think before you do something. Why are you acting like a fool? I told you to stay with me. Why did you go there? Don’t tell him off! It’s my fault. Why did you come here? Look for the boys at the market place. They’re often there. Let’s go. Show us. I can't. I'm sorry. What are you staring at? What is it? Nothing. Show me. Give it to me. Do you even know how to use it? No. Then shoulder, then forehead. If you cut his forehead, blood will run over his eyes. Got it? Once again. Leg, shoulder, forehead. Once again. Leg, shoulder, forehead. Then shoulder again, leg again, forehead and finishing hit. Got it? Once again. Repeat. Leg, shoulder, forehead, shoulder, leg, forehead and finishing hit. Now you try it. Hold the knife like this. First the leg, then the shoulder, then the forehead, shoulder, leg, forehead and finishing hit. Good work. And again. Leg, shoulder, forehead, shoulder, leg, forehead and finishing hit. Good. And remember that this person will try to defend himself. Go ahead and defend yourself. First, the leg. No, like this. Leg, shoulder. If he does that, you grab his hand and hit the shoulder. Got it? Once again. Leg, shoulder, hold his hand, forehead. Right. You can also do "umbrella" and hit to shoulder. Again. Leg. No. Leg, shoulder, grab his hand and umbrella. Shoulder. Right. If he leans against you, you stretch your arm out, hit his leg, his face and finish. - Got it? - Yes. Now you. I play defense. Go. Right. Right, grab my arm, forehead. Umbrella. Shoulder, leg, forehead and finishing hit. Good. Once again. Once again. Do it. Do it! Hit me. Hit me! Leg, grab my arm. Like that. Yes. Grab my arm, and leg. Good job. Once again. Once again! Hit me. Hit me! Yes, like that. Grab my arm. Yes, like that. Right. Well done. Never be afraid of anything. But if they are too many, don’t be a hero. Got it? - Yes. - Run. Repeat after me. Dad. Hi, guys. Don’t move! Stop. That's enough. Let him go. Let him go. Dad. Dad, are you okay? Help! Help! Help! Dad?! Pills in the backpack. Dad? Dad?! Dad, what’s wrong? Dad?! Dad? Dad? Don't worry… things happen. Here you go. No hard feelings, okay? You too. Good luck. Hi. I’m really sorry about that. Don't worry. Everything’s fine. What’s that? From here you can go back to Kherson city. You can figure everything out there. And Nazim? I’ll bury him, don’t worry about it. That prayer… what's it about? It says that Allah is the only God. That he didn’t give birth to anyone and wasn’t given birth by anyone, he has always existed and will exist. How did it start, I can’t remember. Here it is. Read. Good evening. Passport and car papers, please. My son’s body is in the boot, I want to bury him in Crimea. Show me the documents. Why isn’t he in a zinc coffin? I don’t want to get him out of there with a grinder. It's not allowed. Let me decide how to bury my own son. I can’t let you cross the border. Hey! Why are you acting like a general? You’re just fucking about here! Why don’t you try the front line like my son for a change? - Pull over. - What? Pull over! Do you have a light? Thanks. Fire! Freeze! I said freeze! Get in the car! Where are we going? To your uncle's. Who’s there? Mustafa? What happened? Nazim died. You can try to cross Lake Sivash, but I don’t know if it’s safe. I don’t have another option to get to Crimea. Will you help me? Of course I will, but… Can we take your boat? I haven’t used it in a while. It needs a few days running in. I need it today. And get rid of my car. I’ll figure something out. What's he doing here? - Calm down. - What is he doing here? Calm down, please. Did you forget how he dragged me through the mud? Did you forget how he dragged me through the mud?! What is he doing in my house? Galya, please, listen to me. Do you want me to leave? What is he doing here? Listen to me. Nazim died. Why aren’t you asleep? I’ll take them to bed. My condolences. Thank you. Wake up! Come with me. How did you wind up here? We were in the first wave of people coming back after the deportation. But they didn’t allow us to live there, we were evicted. We settled here, closest to Crimea. Nazim was 4 years old, something like that. And I met Galya here. Your grandpa was against it. He tried to make me leave home. He was already very sick. He wanted to die in Crimea, but he didn’t make it. Mustafa even didn’t let Galya come to the funeral. And when we were allowed to live in Crimea, I didn’t want to move. But Mustafa did leave. Crimea is our Jerusalem, as your Grandpa used to say. Is it really so important? Who will need us if we don’t need each other? What's that? Come on, I’ll show you something. Your grandfather is buried here. - Let's ask Uncle? - Come on. Uncle, help us. Give it to me. Kamila! Faster! He’s flying it! There! Flying away! Look how he does it! - Falling! - It’s falling! Run! My God, Mustafa! Forgive me. Please, forgive me. You can’t go anywhere. Promise me you will look after Alim. You’ll be fine. Everything will be fine. Galya, promise me. You need to see a doctor. These injections only give temporary relief. I can’t go to the hospital. Galya, promise me. Please. Hello. Hello, Alim. I’m already at the border. They won’t let anyone in. I can’t cross the border. Where are you? What happened? No idea, they say there was an incident, a fire, a shooting, everyone says something different. I don’t understand anything. I see. We're… already in Crimea. Getting ready for the funeral. Why couldn’t we bury him normally? What? What difference does it make where he’s buried? Here or there. He’s gone! I think you’re tired. Talk to you later. I made some notes here of what and when to read. Read it out loud, so that we hear you. Everyone in this world sheds tears of sorrow, when they lose a loved one. Death separates brothers, and takes sons from their mothers. How many tears of grief have been shed in this world? People have been dying as long as the world has existed. Death destroys our body and leaves only the soul. Everyone who tastes mortal drink, will never more wake. For death will not fail to reach anyone, neither rich nor poor. Everyone keep quiet. I’ll do the talking. That’s it. It's time. Alim. Stay with your uncle. I’ll go alone. Are you out of your mind? Can you make it on your own? Calm down. - Dad! - Calm down! It’s dangerous for you to go. Stay with your uncle. I’ll be back by dawn. We’ll be waiting here for you. Bismillah. Let’s go, Alim. We can’t stay here. Alim! Alim! Dad! - Sit down. - Dad. Sit down. Can you walk? Dad, we’ve almost made it. I’ll rest a while, then catch up. No, let’s walk together. Do you need help? No, I’ll go alone. Dad! Repeat after me…
