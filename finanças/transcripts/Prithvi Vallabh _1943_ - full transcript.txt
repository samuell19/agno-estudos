That's why today I bow my head to you once again... and I pray for a boon that my head never hangs down in shame. And that I never face you with a face wilted in shame. Victory to you and victory to your devotees. God of all Gods, Kailashpati Mahadev... - may you always remain... - Victorious! Victory! Victory! King over all kings, the emperor, Prithvi Vallabh... - may you always remain... - Victorious! Victory! Victory! My pretty maidens, you will be disappointed today. Tailap has arrived from across the Godavari today. Allow him to show his talent today. Victory to the king! Tailap's hands are so rough... allowing him to wash your lovely feet... would be an insult to music and art. You are forgetting, Kaviraj Tailap has washed my feet so many times... his hands are no longer rough. And he is my friend as well. Victory to the king! A wounded and loser can't be your friend. Any man who loses fifteen times and still has courage to fight... I do not consider him a coward. Blessed are you, your highness! Welcome to my court, Tailap. Begin your work now. I refuse. Why? When you have washed these feet fifteen times... why are you ashamed to wash them for the sixteenth time? And this time the pots too are from your country. The water is from your country, too. Using water from Telangan in pots from Telangan, the king of Telangan... will wash the feet of the king Prithvi Vallabh of Avantipur. And wash his sixteenth defeat from his mind along with it. Pick up the pots of water and move forward. After that I shall consider you my friend and seat you next to me. No, Munj. These hands won't touch those feet again... that have trounced the modesty of hundreds of women. I won't touch those hands that embrace new women daily. Tailap, these are not your words. Your sister Mrinalvati is speaking through you. One whose life is dry like the desert... and as morose as a crematorium. One whose lips have not once tasted life... and whose eyes have not once seen the colors of life. What would you know about life and the joys of life? Anyway, if you want your life and freedom once again... then you should begin your errand. Victory to the king! Will you release Tailap again? Any man who cannot forgive his foe is a coward. But priest of kingdom had made a prediction... the king could lose the seventeenth battle. What's the harm in losing once after hundreds of victories? If prince Bhoj had been here... If prince Bhoj had been here, could he order me not to forgive him? You are mistaken, Kaviraj. I apologize, your highness. Come on, Tailap, either you wash my feet and return to your country... or be trampled by the elephant and head for the other world. Make an instant decision. Here or there? Enough, king Tailap, you are my friend hereafter. Come, sit here. Where are the fair cuckoos of my court? Tell them to entertain my guest... with the magic of their feet and voice. Smile through your eyes The remind hopes The eyes. Yes, yes, smile through your eyes Keep narrating the story of youth The eyes. Yes, yes, smile through your eyes Friend, bring some liquor Bring the glowing beauty Give to drink smile of heart The eyes. Yes, yes, smile through your eyes Dhananjay, prepare to get king Tailap... and his companions across the Godavari. But take care he has no problems on the way. The king's wishes will be obeyed fully. Let's go, your highness. What are you thinking? I am wondering when I return defeated to my country... what will my sister have to say about it? Throw all the worship platters away! And inform the cooks in the palace to prepare pudding today. His highness likes to eat pudding. - But... - I am aware of what I'm doing. And I know what the significance. Go! The significance is that you are humiliating me. But think about it and tell me what else could I do? What else could you do? You could have kept the battle going? You could have refused to put down your weapons. You could have given your life and saved the country's dignity. But one who loves his life so much can achieve nothing. He can only talk big. I did not save my life because I love life so much. I saved my life so I could exact vengeance on the foe. Don't deceive yourself. You know you cannot exact vengeance on the foe. You can only wash his feet. You can bow to him. You can only appeal to him for life. This is exactly what I did so many times. I attacked the enemy so many times. But destiny favored him every time. I had to return defeated every time. A man can fight his foe but he cannot fight his destiny. So you think you are nothing? You think everything hinges on your destiny. Your destiny is a river... and you are a blade of straw floating in its current. Your destiny is a storm and you a leaf flitting in the gale. Your destiny is a potter and you are wet clay toy in his hands. Wow. You have praised to high heaven. The future generations of India... will go insane with joy at the mention of your name. Didn't I try to fight destiny? Did I not attack the foe sixteen times? And were you not defeated sixteen times? Just who is to blame for this? You or someone else? The reason for my defeat is that I fight him in his home. The reason he wins is that he fights from his homestead. Even a cat is like a tiger in her own house. Then do something to cause him to attack your country. But he does not. Tell him to attack our country. I shall break his face. I shall tame him. I'll snatch his weapons. I shall tell you the means. Has he sent his royal emissary with you? Yes. - Arrest him. - Then he will attack us. Is that it? Have you lost all your bravado? Just now you were claiming if he mounts an attack on you... you would do this and you would do that. Now you're afraid he will mount an attack. Apparently you have not returned to prepare to retaliate. You saved your life and you're here to hide behind your sister. Look, sister, it's like this. Our dignity... What dignity? A man should save his life. Things matter only if you are alive. Eat, drink and be merry. This is life. This is youth. What was that sound? Pudding is being prepared. I asked you what that sound was. The sound of two metal containers striking. The sound of two metal striking metal? Stop all that? Don't you know my brother is afraid of that sound? When metal struck metal at the battlefield my brother came here... to hide behind his sister's skirt. If metal strikes metal here as well, where else will he flee? And what will you lose if he leaves? I will lose my brother and be left alone. Go! What are you staring at me for? Go stop that sound. Send a messenger Bhillam. I wish to see him in my palace. Victory to the king! Bhillam, arrest Dhananjay, Munj's royal poet. Assemble your soldiers on the banks of the Godavari. And dispatch a message to Munj... if he considers himself to be brave... let him attack us to release his poet. But, your highness... He is the king. It's his job to give orders. You are the general. Your job is to follow the orders. The winds are so mysterious Look at the unique gait, look at the manner Swords and arrows are playing in the world There is playing drum loudly The world trembles The winds are so mysterious A blade of grass used to battle the storm in one country It's all God's dignity The winds are so mysterious Greetings, queen mother. Charini, don't you know singing is prohibited in this country? Singing is the thirst in a person's mind. And being happy is man's birthright. If your mind is ill why do you shut the doors of joy for others? Today you say singing is prohibited in this country. Tomorrow you will say laughing is prohibited in this country. Think about it. How long will your people endure your injustice? Those who don't wish to endure it can leave this state... but nobody will be permitted to sing over here. There was some good news for you in my songs today. But if you don't want to hear it? Anyway... Hold it, Charini. What good news have you brought me? In my song, our king has won the battle. And his opponent is defeated. Does... Does that mean my brother caught him? No man in this world can catch Munj. Your misfortune has caught him. Man feels that destiny is smiling down upon him. But he does not know... that very smile will turn into the flame that will engulf him. Munj has lost the battle. You will lose your life. Charini! Charini read the events in the blue skies and read them to you. She is not to blame for it. The winds are so mysterious Look at its unique gait, look at the manner The winds are so mysterious Laxmi look. - She is meditating. - You were right. Vilas! Vilas! Go out and bring me news when anybody arrives. God, I came here to pray for my brother's victory... but apparently you have already answered my prayers. And my brother was victorious. My prayer to you now is that when I see that sinner Munj... being dragged through Telang tied to an elephant's foot... please protect me lest I lose my senses from all the happiness. Praise to the king of Telang! Praise to the king of Telang! Praise to the king of Telang! Who is that, mother? Munj's poet. Who told you that? Bilas's father. Munj is such a fool! He doesn't understand a poet can only hurl verbal arrows at home. He can't throw iron arrows on the battlefield. He came to win the battle with such useless people. Praise to the king of Telang! Praise to the king of Telang! That is Munj. He looks so handsome. And brave too. Praise to the king of Telang! So this is Munj! Why is Munj being made to walk? Thanks to brother's kindness. This man only deserves to be shackled and dragged. I ask you, is Munj a very evil man? There couldn't be a more evil man than him in the entire world. But he is so handsome. Girl, get into your senses. What business is it of yours who is handsome and who's not? If you cannot keep control over your mind, then leave. Go! The question now is, how do we punish Munj? Behead him. Pardon me. By custom... a king can't be beheaded anywhere but the battlefield. And Munj is not on the battlefield now, he is in the dungeon. If we have to kill him... then the battlefield and prison are one and the same. What's the difference? - That's all well and good... - Be quiet for a while. King Bhillam is right. Beheading a man kills him instantly. I want Munj to be given a much tougher sentence. But what punishment could we mete out to him... by which we don't behead him... and he suffers a fate worse than death? Wipe the smile off his lips! Snatch the light from his eyes! Snatch the glow from his face! Most of all, snatch his pride from him! Life will be a living hell without his pride. And this living hell will be far more horrific than death! But Munj will die before he surrenders his pride. Nobody can take his pride away from him. I believe I can take it away from him. You? Where are you holding him? In the royal dungeon. I shall go to the dungeon this evening... so he can see my power and I can see his helplessness. He should be made aware it is time for his pride to end. That is fine. Now Bhillam, what reward would you like? Anything I can offer you won't be nearly enough. Your happiness is my greatest reward. Still, you should request something. Do not hesitate. You'll receive anything you want. Your highness, I have only one desire. And you know what it is. Prince Styashay's and Vilaswati's marriage? Yes, your highness. It shall be done next month. Victory to the king! But that is an old score. You can demand another boon for this battle. Highness, I lack nothing under your realm. Still if you wish... Say what you have to say fearlessly. I would like Munj's poet's life be spared. The praises of poets are phony. What will you gain by saving his life? You could demand something else. What else can I demand? You have given me everything. What do you want to do after freeing him? Anything you please. What can I say? I shall tell you. Until now he's been singing in praise of Munj. Tell him to sing his criticism hereafter. Killing two birds with one stone. Alright. King Bhillam, your request is accepted. I shall release the men to you. But take care. You will be responsible if he takes flight. Praise the queen mother. Welcome, royal poet. You won't lack anything over here. I am fond of poetry and so is my wife. Are you the royal poet's young disciple? His name is Rasnidhi. Your name sounds as nice as you look. Please come. I found wealth called Ram Neither did I embark on a pilgrimage nor mediation The wealth called Ram constricted itself and came home I found wealth called Ram I didn't go to bathe in the Ganges nor blow the conch Good fortune favored me and my mind comprised of Ram Talk about love at this age. Mrinalvati is the queen mother of this country. All other wealth comes and goes, it is temporary shade The wealth called Ram doesn't diminish It is always on the lips I found wealth called Ram Vilas! Vilas, my dear, do you recall you saw him in the procession? He is Munj's royal poet Dhananjay. This is his disciple Rashmidhi. Bow to him, my dear. We are poets. You are poetry. We watch and then pen your thoughts and actions... which makes us poets. So why should you bow to us? We are the ones who should bow to you. Did you see that, my girl? Every word they utter is sheer poetry. Anyway, go and tell your mother to prepare to welcome them. Come along, royal poet. What's that rascal doing? He is asleep at this time, queen mother. He can get sleep? He even sings sometimes, queen mother. Open the door! He will have to sing another song in future. Be gentle. You will sprain your dainty foot. Mind your language! The sister of the king of Tailap is standing in front of you. I reckoned that already. Waking up Prithvi Vallabh from his sleep... couldn't be the feat of any ordinary woman. Even in this dire condition you are unaware... to whom you are speaking? What dire condition, pretty lady? Ask your reputation, ask your poets, ask your soldiers. And if anything is remaining, then ask your misplaced fate. Then listen to me. Having heard of my fame, you planned on defeating me. Hearing my poets' songs... the flames in your mind were stoked furthermore. And on seeing my soldiers' bravery... you instigated your brother to deceive me. And as for my misplaced fate... the king of Tailap's reclusive sister... has renounced her reclusive status ran here to see it. And this very reclusive will see you die like a dog tomorrow. No, pretty lady, a hero never dies like a dog. A hero always dies like a hero. And one who dies like a hero, never really dies. Damn you! You consider transgression to be heroic. I followed my heart. Where's the transgression in that? Surrendering to your heart is the greatest transgression of all. No, pretty lady, surrendering to the heart is not transgression. Suppressing the emotions of the heart is transgression. Mrinalvati, I ask you, why do you not smile? Look, the stony walls of this dungeon... which have unfortunately always stopped its prisoners... even they are smiling today thanks to someone's fortune. - Your fortune? - No. Your fortune. The good fortune of your life. The good fortune of the change in your life. It is a false notion. It is not a false notion, the greatest fact of life. I ask you, Mrinalvati, why are you suppressing your emotions? You still have time. Open the eyes of youth. Else, if middle age kicks in... it will be impossible for youth or love to rouse. Even considering love is a sin for ascetic Mrinalvati. You call love a transgression? When I heard tales of your transgressions... I had the feeling people were bragging... but now I realize they were telling the truth. I have no idea what people brag about or what you've heard... but I know I have always enjoying life and its pleasures... and held my head high at all times. I have enjoyed every moment of life with every fiber of my being. I always kept the present in mind... and never cared about the future. That's why I was content in the past and am content even today. - With your defeat? - With my victory. You deem this to be your victory? Certainly. You came here seeking to gain control over me... but you're leaving this place under my control. What is this if not victory? The person who can gain control of me isn't born as yet. You are forgetting he was born forty years ago. Then he should prepare to die now. I am always prepared to die. But do remember, I won't be alone at the time of death. Someone else will be with me. Your orders have been complied with. Munj's people who accepted work have been employed. And what about those who do not wish to work? There are many of those. They will be executed tomorrow. Why tomorrow? Why not today? I met Munj just now. He is not a human being, but is a living sin. But he is smart. He believes he is God. I wish to sentence him to the most severe punishment. I said it before that he should be executed. No. I want to terminate his pride before executing him. What should we do now? Lock him up in an iron cage and leave him in the street... so passersby can see him and laugh at his condition. Alright. Mrinalvati, why are you wasting your youth? 'You still have time. Open the eyes of youth.' 'Else when middle age kicks in... it will be impossible for youth or love to rouse.' 'You came here seeking to gain control over me... but you're leaving this place under my control.' 'What is this if not victory? ' No, no! Give me strength, God! My asceticism is sustained, my word is sustained... and my vows are sustained. Let my head be held high in the world. Let my head be held down in obeisance to you. My head is always held high in the world. And I am happy under every condition. But I regret seeing that your king arrested King Vallabh... and you people are dressed so simply. Go get decked... or the world will say the subjects of Telang are very poor. Why are you shoving me? And where are the pretty ladies of your family? Without them your happiness will remain incomplete today. Come here. Come here. Prithvi Vallabh is calling you. - Do you know how to sing? - Sing? You are born in Telangan. Had you been born in Avantipur... your beauty would be beyond compare by now. - Tell me, do you know to dance? - No. That is your second misfortune. - Do you know to play anything? - No. No! Why are you people laughing? Your kind has returned victorious. Don't you congratulate him with song and dance? Is this reason to laugh or cry? Come, let me teach you a song. Say, there's no singing in Tailap's township. Sing. You should be delighted at your good fortune. For Prithvi Vallabh is teaching you a song. There's no singing in Tailap's township. There's no singing in Tailap's township Very good! Very good! There's no singing, there's no playing There's no celebration of life's joys What are you doing? Why are you afraid? Come, paint the town red When the moon rises, you see the world Help the moon rise yourself If it shines in a dark house, it lights up your mind Make it work Come, paint the town red Enjoy the pleasures of life Enjoy as you wish Leave tomorrow's worries pending for the future Just live in the present Lose your senses Enjoy the pleasures of life Leave tomorrow's worries pending for the future Just live in the present Lose your senses Come, paint the town red Take the spark from your eye Light a fire in your heart Burn down your house and show the world Dear drunk... take the spark from your eye Light a fire in your heart Burn down your house and show the world Dear drunk... come, paint the town red Everything in this life is really... truly, surreally, habitually, eternally... Take a seat. Everything in this life is really... truly, surreally, habitually, eternally and... What are you doing? - I'm composing a song. - You compose songs all the time? I'm a poet. - You laugh all the time? - I'm a girl. Are you comfortable over here? If you need anything, tell me. You shall have it. Could you give me what I require? If am unable to do so, you could tell father. What's the point? Everything is available in Telangan. But I cannot have my country in Telangan. That breeze, that water, my own people. Those packed streets, those familiar markets. A city to others and heaven to me. Even my mother sighs this way for her country. But she was a queen over there. She isn't a queen over here. You were a poet over there and you're a poet over here too. Who is preventing you from composing poetry? You can compose day and night. Here is a waterfall, here are some lotuses, birds here... flowers over here and shrubs over here. Take a look at these and compose a song. Poems and songs are composed... when lovely people say lovely things in their own free country. This is not my country... and my lips cannot utter the language of my heart here - Are you married? - No. Lies. In that case, take it for granted that it is. That's why your heart isn't over here. I need something to keep my heart here. If you... Keep your heart under control. And if a person doesn't have a heart, what should he do? Never mind. You don't know what love is. People say love is a kind of malady. No, Vilasvati, love is the awakening of youth. But youth is a dream. If youth is a dream then this too is a dream. And you will understand this when you get married. - You're going to marry Satyashdeh, aren't you? - Yes. Don't you get butterflies in your stomach when you see him? - No. - Too bad! - Have you ever read a play? - No. - That's even worse. A book of poems? - No! - Then you should read one. - Who will read it to me? I will read it to you. Look, I will read Shakuntala to you first. What will you read, Rashnidhi? Vilasvati wishes to read Shakuntala. Shakuntala? Good. What's the harm? Beauty and youth. Youth and beauty. It's an old story. Beauty and youth. Everywhere you look there is a shadow of beauty and youth. You've come. Welcome. I was waiting for you. - You were waiting for me? - I was confident you would come. You were certain I would come? But what's the reason for this confidence? Never once has it happened in Vallabh's life... that he has extended a hand towards something... and that thing hasn't come running to him. Be thankful you didn't extend your hand towards the moon. Mrinalvati, why don't you look at facts in the light of truth? Look, I extended my hand to the moon... and the moon is standing in front of me. And this moon no longer has the courage... to escape from me and return to its place. Munj, your talks are sinful. Everything I say is full of poetry. There is a vast difference between poetry and sin. But you have adopted asceticism. You can understand asceticism. But what is poetry... what is love, what is magic of youth... what is the secret of beauty and loveliness? You still do not understand that. Do you know why a bee palpitates for a flower? Do you know why a moth dies for a flame? Do you know why the partridge leaps towards the moon? If not, then sit here and ask me. I can answer everything. I haven't come here to sit. I am here to teach you something. Teach me what you wish to teach me. But know this before you teach me anything... I was the son of a orphan Rashpati Vallabh. Leopards have nursed me, elephants have patted me to sleep. I have begged for alms and donated crown. I have sucked the blood of the rich and I have bled for the poor. I studied texts and scriptures and meditated. And I studied the art of makeup... and enjoyed the pleasures of life. Now you teach me what's remaining. Mrinalvati, what can you teach me? There's a lot you need to learn yourself. You haven't enjoyed the Spring of life as yet. You haven't understood the secrets of a moonlit night. You haven't sung songs of love as yet. You haven't experienced youth as yet. And you haven't embraced your lover... and understood happiness. You are offending a recluse by saying such things to her. No, pretty lady, Prithvi Vallabh never offends a pretty lady. And especially not the woman who is his queen of hearts. Sinner! How dare you! Is anyone there? Burn his hands. Excuse me. Burn his hands. What will you gain by burning my hands? They got burned just by touching you. Burn my heart if you must burn something. Silence! Hurry up! Grab him! Why do you need to grab me? Here. Burn it. Stop it! Is that it? So soon? Had I known you would be pleased so easily... I would have burned my hands myself. You would have no discomfort, nor would your men. You will see what happens tomorrow. And you will see what happens tomorrow evening. What will happen tomorrow evening? To understand the secrets of life and youth you will return to me. But Mrinalvati, bring some ointment with you tomorrow. You need not worry so much. Just state what you want and believe me it will be done. Then summon him to the court tomorrow... and get him to wash your feet. I do not want his name to be with him. Very well. Tomorrow people will look him, they'll say he is so big. It is so great! 'Would he be willing to wash my brother's feet?' 'Will my brother able to snatch him proud.' 'Will my wish be fulfilled? But what is my wish?' 'I do not know what my wish is.' 'I don't understand what it is that I want.' 'I do not know what to ask for.' He has offended me. Execute him! What are you looking at? Finish him! Hold it! Executing an unarmed man this way is cowardice. But... The court has come to an end today. Munj's fate will be decided later. What is the meaning of this? It means if you had executed him now... you would have gained notoriety for eternity. I have gained notoriety even now. A man does not gain notoriety by holding strength in captivity. One makes a good name. But what is the harm in having him executed? There is great harm. A king can't be attacked anywhere but on the battlefield. If he didn't wash your feet... you could sentence him to something else. He can't be held in prison. He cannot be executed. So exactly what should we do? Apparently you no longer have faith in me. When did I say that? Then leave this task to me. I shall make everything better. I don't understand. You will. You will. Look here. This is the tunnel. Vilas's mother told the truth. We have done it! The king will be shocked. He will state that you are brave. A hero. Go out. If there's any danger, toss a pebble towards me. I'll be alerted. The doors to heaven have opened up to the world Elixir is pouring in every city and every path There is dissipation everywhere The doors to heaven have opened up to the world It is the season of magic in the world Everyone is glowing afresh Flowers are abloom and so are thorns It is such an awesome Spring The doors to heaven have opened up to the world A glimmer of hope is aroused in the mind Darkness is shed The conscience was aroused when the world awoke There's no limit to his glory The doors to heaven have opened up to the world Vilasvati, so you've started singing fake songs composed by poets? When did I sing? Apparently you're hearing things. Either I'm hearing things or your mouth is blowing off. Did you wish to see me? No, I did not wish to see you. You asked to see me. - I forgot. - Don't come any closer. So why did you come here? I came here to learn Shakuntala from Guru. I don't think Guru will be able to teach you Shakuntala today. So why did you want to see me? I wanted to see you so I could request your permission to leave. I'll be going home. When? Today. And when will you return? Does a bird that's freed from the cage ever return to the cage? If it fell in love with something in the cage it could return. Independence is a bad thing. - Bondage is bad too. - Love is bondage. You were the one who said, love is a bondage... and the world goes crazy over that bondage. Poets consider this bondage a great gift. Songs of this bondage echo through the entire world. Ponder that and tell me... whether or not the bird will return to the cage. The bird says no. Then the bird is selfish. He will forget the cage the moment he is distanced from it. The cage is made of iron. It won't feel the separation from the bird. Sure, the cage is made of iron, but its heart isn't made of iron. So why doesn't the cage go to the bird's country with the bird? The sparrow is willing but do the bird's wings have nerve? Let the cage know that the bird's wings have the nerve. Then let the bird also know that the cage is willing. Vilas. The bird is flying off to its country You have great pride in your country What's so special about your country? Due to what, oh bird... Due to what, oh bird, you don't like other lands? What is your country like, oh bird? My country is incredibly classy Trouble stays away from my country My country is a piece of heaven It is prospering always The bird is flying off to his country There will be difficulties in the way They will scare you every step of the way We will be like stars and fly from above Our Gods will help us Our Gods will help us. Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh The bird is flying off to his country What is going on over here? I asked you what is going on over here. Don't you know this temple is only for the people of Rajpur? I didn't come to the temple. I came here to meet Vilasvati. Why? Her father saved my life so I felt I should meet her. You have no business here! Go on your way. Tell your father to release me. I shall leave right away. I said, go! I must drop Vilasvati off at her house. Vilasvati can go home herself. Scram! Vilasvati, you shouldn't speak to such people. He is not a bad person. You are the future queen of this country. You should not mingle with bards and poets. Where the king and queen get habituated to song and poetry... the country heads for destruction. What does this man know besides falsehood and flattery? Is poetry and falsehood one and the same? - Yes, it is one and the same. Get it? - Got it. Crying over every little thing is a sign of weakness, Vilasvati. You should have control over your mind. Goodbye. Goodbye. When your magic hands touch me... you apply ointment to my hand but my mind is uplifted. Your eyes are playful. Your attitude is playful. Sometimes you apply ointment... and sometimes you wound me. Mrinalvati, being coy this way won't do any good. Tell me what you've got on your mind. Nothing. Lies. You are wondering where this love was before. Shall I answer that? Waiting for your lover your love went into hibernation. Your lover came along and the love was aroused. Now that your love is aroused, don't suppress it in your heart. - Let it come to the lips. - I am not a man. What do you mean? When a man's love is aroused, it talks and makes claims. When a woman's love is aroused, it remains silent... and sacrifices. Mrinal, whether a man is in love or a woman... there is only one rule to it. When it is aroused, it is happy, it smiles, it chirps... and it never thinks of the consequences in the future. Do you understand, highness? - May I ask you something? - Go ahead. When you called me 'Your Highness' today... why did you keep your hands away? It seems to me you want to burn my other hand too. But I am not such an imbecile. Please forgive me, I made a blunder. What are you doing? In my country a woman never apologizes to her lover. But the rules in your homeland seem to be backwards. - So I should follow your rules hereafter? - Undoubtedly. Now that you are my queen... you should follow the rules of my homeland. Then you should apologize to me now. I should apologize? But what is my fault? Your fault is that you disrupted my austerity. Well, Mrinal, in that case you haven't understood love as yet. Love, too, is a kind of austerity which produces happiness. And every person on earth wishes to be happy. Any person who flees from happiness is ill. Until now you were ill and you were looking for treatment... of your illness in austerity and detachment. But you have got rid of your illness today. Now tell me, are you or aren't you experiencing euphoria? - No. - That means 'yes'. When a woman says 'no' at the beginning, it means 'yes'. How do you know this? You aren't a woman. I am not a woman but I am surely an astrologer to women. Really? And now this astrologer is asking his queen to sit here. - May I sit here as well? - No. Very well. When a woman says no at the beginning, it means yes. - Good day. - Good day. - Good day. - Good day. Prithvi Vallabh, I should leave now. What if someone finds out? Finds out? We aren't committing a sin. You are so fearless. You don't worry about anyone. Slaves and weak people worry. You are truly Prithvi Vallabh. - You refused to believe it earlier. - I believe it now. Do I have permission to leave now? - When will you return? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow will come by after years. Then I shall appear the moment you think of me. - Tonight? - I shall come. - Your highness. - Who is it? Prince Bhoj. I am not Prince Bhoj. I am poet Rashnidhi. If I was Bhoj, I'd be captive along with you. Very good, Mr. Rashnidhi. Are you alone? I too am here, your highness. You have come too? Very good. I thought poets could only make their way into hearts. But now I know even stones in the soil make way for them. Well, let me welcome you. Your highness, there's no time. Let's get out of here. I have planned an escape through this tunnel. King Bhillam, Laxmi and Vilas are awaiting us. King Bhillam. The defeated king of Seelam. Yes, your highness. He is supporting me? What's so surprising about that? But he is Tailap's friend. And he hopes to see his daughter as the queen of Telangan. If not Telangan he can hope she becomes the queen of Avantipur. Oh! That's right, your highness. Instead of Satyashray... he is willing have his daughter marry Prince Bhoj. Very good, Bhoj. It is great news... that you entered Tailap's house and slapped him in his face. Very good. And royal poet, have you found a woman for yourself too? No, your highness. What can I do? I feel very sorry for your condition. You have lost your youth very soon. Let's go. We're losing time. If we lose this opportunity... - If someone comes... - The two of you leave for now. I'll remain here until tomorrow. Why? What's going to happen tomorrow? Someone is going to come to me. Who have you found over here, your highness? The queen mother of Telangan. Tailap's sister. - Mrinalvati? - Yes, Mrinalvati. Why, Dhananjay? What are you thinking? I am wondering how the stone got a hole in it. When you can make a hole in the stone, I am, after all, your king. But, your highness, if you leave now... couldn't Mrinalvati come to Avantipur? She can come. But I cannot leave without her. You are still a child. - Shall we return tomorrow night? - Yes. Both Mrinal and I shall go with you tomorrow. - Goodbye, your highness. - Goodbye. He is truly a man whom the world must rise up to see. He lost the battle but he hasn't lost his pluck. Even his defeat is greater than our victory. Ordinary people just cannot understand... what Prithvi Vallabh is doing. Prithvi Vallabh is in thought. Let him think. Prithvi Vallabh's queen wishes to know... what Prithvi Vallabh is thinking. And Prithvi Vallabh has no right to try to keep anything from his queen. Prithvi Vallabh is thinking how to play this love match. Exactly as he is. That's just the problem. There is no problem. We will find some solution in a few days time. Mrinal, I am captive over here. Your brother is my foe. If anyone finds out, this love story will end. Then find a way. There are ways, but will you join me? Tell me. The first solution would be that you forget me. The second option? The second option is that you kill Tailap and occupy the throne. He is my parents' son. The third solution? The third option is that we run underground. - I don't understand. - You don't understand? Look over there. What have you decided? I accept. - How about tomorrow night? - Okay. - Hello. - Long live. - Hello. - Hello. - Prithvi Vallabh hasn't come? - No. - Why not? - What can I say? He said tomorrow. Will there be an eclipse tonight? The things is... Don't tell this to anyone. Mrinalvati is in love with the king. She will be accompanying us tomorrow. What are you saying? Love at that age? The era of life is here I spotted the sun in the dark. And I yearned for it The era of life is here The garden is abloom after wilting Every fibre of my being is alive again The sleeping land has arisen She is dressed so beautifully The era of life is here The era of life is the era of love Do not think of the consequences of love To hell with the consequences Let your dream come first Ahead life is happy Behind is darkness of shadow The era of life is here You don't seem to be offended by my singing today? No. Why not? Why are you keeping it from me? I know everything. No, Charini. You know nothing. The master of a dark house thought darkness was everything. Today he has seen the moon. A citizen of a depressed state thought crying was everything. Today he has seen a smile. A bud has shed its veil today. A flower has? Today. A sleeping garden has dreamt of spring today. Charini. I told you before Munj has lost the battle... and you will lose your heart. Charini... trust me. But it should come to something. If there is nothing then prepare to discreetly escape. This is the day of your victory or defeat. If you escape you will be victorious. If you remain then you will be defeated. - Does that mean I must talk now? - Yes. I'm afraid if I leave with Prithvi Vallabh... I will be neither here nor there. I have wealth in my hands over here. I will only have Prithvi Vallabh over there. And even he won't be in my power. I will be in his power. Will that be victory or defeat? Until now you've been wandering in the dry afternoon of life. He has blended the colors of life in your life. Will you be able to give up those nights? Think about it. I have other fears too. Prithvi Vallabh is young, handsome and astute. And he is a? Of youth. If he takes me to his kingdom and leaves me... what will become of me? Mrinalvati, love is a gamble. It is wagered. It is not considered. I am afraid, Charini. Love leaves the place where there is fear. This is for the brave. For the weak it is a sin. I have made up my mind. Prithvi Vallabh will continue to remain in captivity. Your highness, come along. Hold it, Rashnidhi. Let Mrinal come. But, your highness, it wouldn't be wise to delay. Slowly. Very softly. Footsteps should not be heard. Listen, it appears as though the secret is out. Leave immediately. But you come along too, your highness. I cannot leave alone without Mrinalvati. How can I leave you behind in danger? Do not worry, Bhoj. This is not the time for bravado. It is time to be shrewd and astute. Go to Avantipur immediately. And as soon as possible assemble and army and mount an attack. And get me out of here with dignity, Bhoj. With dignity. I see. So you wanted to escape. I did not need your permission for it. So why didn't you leave? I am the master of my mind. I'm not a slave to anyone. I am Prithvi Vallabh. You will know that when you will be trampled by an elephant. So do it. I have been hearing your threats for many days now. You won't hear it much longer. Guards, stay alert! Let's go, Chaudhary! - Prithvi Vallabh has been caught. - He's caught? - How are our men doing? - They have left. And Vilas? She's waiting for you. We should escape tomorrow. It would be a big thing if you leave today. But Prithvi Vallabh is left. I've arranged for horses on the other side of the tunnel. Take this sword. It'll come in handy. Tell Vilas I shall meet her. - Okay. Goodbye. - Goodbye. You haven't seen Rashnidhi, have you? No. What's the matter? You are telling lies. I have seen him. He went this way. The secret is out. His highness cannot come. You leave immediately. But what will become of highness? Hold it! Could you tell us where the prince has gone? Yes. He went that way. Behind the Rashnidhi. Please protect him, God! Before leaving, tell us what you will tell your father. Vilas! I killed Vilas. - You killed her? - Yes. She didn't deserve to live. So you killed my daughter! - Did you hear what I said? - Yes, I heard. And you remain quiet even after hearing it? Alright. You worship the royalty.♪♪♪♪$$$$$%%%%%$$$$$♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ And what can a royalty worshipper do but remain silent? So move forward and fall on your knees. Fold your hands. Take the soil from under his feet and apply it on your forehead. He is brave. He has killed your only daughter. It seems like a maid has nursed you, not a queen. How else is it possible... that your daughter's killer is in front of you... and you aren't chopping his head off? I ask you, what are you gazing at in the air? I ask you, what are you gazing at in the air? Laxmi, I know you are livid at this time. But being livid does not mean you can lose your senses. Think about what you are saying. I am saying that... my daughter wanted to flee with Bhoj with my blessings. And the punishment is death. But even you wanted to flee with Munj... without your brother and king's permission. Laxmi! So why is your head still secure on your shoulders? Laxmi! Who says aunt wanted to flee with Munj? - I say so. - You are telling lies. If aunt intended to flee with Munj... she would not order me to catch him. And I swear by God she is the one who sent me to catch him. Why don't you say something? Why don't you shut her up? Why don't you say this is a lie? Why don't you say this is a lie? Yes. Say it. This is a lie. Say this is a lie. Say it. Say this is a blemish on your pious life. Say this is the greatest sin of our era. You see? She won't say it. Therefore she admits what I said is true. It means at this ripe age she wanted to flee with Munj... the enemy of the state. Lift your sword now... and attack her throat to save your honor. And I shall witness you saving your honor. King Bhillam, take Laxmi away at this time. Take me away from here! Take me away from here! Else I will drink his blood. He killed my daughter. Come on, let's go. Come. Who is our in this country. - King Bhillam. You summoned your soldiers over here? - Yes. Have you lost your mind? - What? - You and your soldiers can't leave. I shall see who has the power to prevent me! I shall prevent you. A man can harness water and wind... but nobody can harness tempest and storm. Move away! Bring the horses and weapons. We are going to our country now. Right this minute Come, milady. Let's go. Stop. Shut the gates leading out of the city. Thank God you are alive! King Bhillam! Mother! Tell me, royal poet, what should we do now? King Bhillam, Bhoj is young, I am a poet. You are our king at this time. Just command us and we shall follow it. Let him go. You go assemble an army. I shall assemble my soldiers. We shall meet here eight days from now. And the eighth day will be a day of destruction for Tailap. - Greetings. - Bless you. You have arrived in time, prince. How could I not? Today is the eighth day. Still I feel we have tarried. I pray to God your feelings are unfounded. There is only one solution for that. We should mount an attack right now. Land of God! Rules of justice! Command of the royal court! This is to inform all citizens... Munj, the prisoner of war will make his final plea to Mrinalvati. After which he will be publicly trampled by an elephant. She chants God's name and does injustice. Has our king forgotten... this very Munj spared his life sixteen times? And Munj is being victimized this way today! What is the motive behind this victimization? The motive is simply that Munj is brave. Even in this condition look at the pride... with which he's headed towards the elephant. Mrinalvati, your brother says I should appeal to you. But I wonder what you can give me. You've already given me everything you had. Being scared like this will not do. The world will say Prithvi Vallabh taught Mrinalvati to love... but he didn't teach her how to control her mind. Be brave. Give him charity. Please forgive me. This is my fault. I am the cause of your death. You are so innocent. You are mistaken if you think I am dying because of you. If your brother feels he is killing me then he too is mistaken. The date and time of my death was preordained before I was born. No, no! I will not let you die! Citizens of Telangan, look at your king's gallantry. He is wreaking vengeance on his sister in lieu of me. He is not the least bit ashamed of himself. Shut up! It is God's doing! A hyena is telling a tiger to be silent. You can say anything you please... but this very hyena will emerge victorious today. Your eyes are at fault here, not you. Bhoj is assembling an army in Avantipur. King Bhillam is preparing to avenge me in Seelam. The subjects of your state do not support you. In your house, your sister doesn't support you. The pride in your heart doesn't support you either. Who has won? You or me. You will find out right now. You wanted to repress me but you failed to do so. You wanted to take away my pride but you failed to do so. You wanted to be known as a good person to your subjects... but your subjects are abusing you. And each one of your people has respect for me. Tell me who won. You or me. Look over there. Now tell me who is victorious. You or me. When you were facing death... had you gone and embraced it then... not only me, the entire world would believe you won. But you didn't have the guts and so you lost. And I... I see my death in front of me and I am smiling. And no warrior on earth has the power to wipe the smile off my face. So whether you admit to it or not... but the world today is saying this... and the world tomorrow will say it... Tailap lost in battle and Prithvi Vallabh won. Bluffing your way will do no good. Take him away! Do not disgrace Prithvi Vallabh. He will walk to his death on his legs. And you will see Prithvi Vallabh's death is just as grand... as the life he led. Why? Are you afraid? If Prithvi Vallabh gets scared the world will? So why did you stop? I was thinking, Laxmi will go to Vishnu. Fame and fortune will go to the brave. But Saraswati won't find any place after my death. Where will the poor thing go? King of elephants, the king of all kings is facing you today. Salute him. Mahout, my elephant is showing disrespect to me. Tears in your eyes? Move forward. Bring the elephant forward. Your highness, please accept this last gift from this maiden. Mahout, if you love your life then move the elephant immediately. Do not hurry. You aren't to blame for this. Prithvi Vallabh commands you to carry out your duty. Hail Mahakaal! Hail Mahakaal! Stop, mahout! Stop, mahout! Stop! Stop, mahout! Hail Mahakaal! Father. Stop, mahout! Long live Prithvi Vallabh. Wow! His death was just as heroic as his life. You are blessed, Mrinalvati. You died in such a brave man's arms. Bhoj! Stayashey, shut the gates of the fort. Take him away. The place for a coward is under the feet of a rogue elephant. Victory to king Bhoj! Victory! Victory! God, my first victory has raised my head in the world today. Therefore I bow my head to you. And I pray to you, the way my father's head never bowed... to anyone till the time he died... similarly all my life my head will bow to nobody but you. Victory to you! Victory to your devotees. Victory to king Bhoj! Victory to king Bhoj! Victory to king Bhoj!
