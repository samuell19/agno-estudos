Sweetie? What have you got here Daddy? Why is there a man asleep in your truck? He's not asleep. Why, I rescued him Baby. He was lying in his car looking like he's got nothing better to do but dying of cold, so, you know I thought I'd bring him back here. Where he can spend Christmas with us. He's spending Christmas with us? Well he can't stay out in the cold any longer, I bet he's changing colour! Well let's get him inside and warm him up. Are you sure he's not already dead? Of course. He'll wake up soon. Clean him up and he'll be fine. Go and run the bath Pumpkin. Keep an eye on him. Daddy... What if he doesn't like me? Well then the pigs can have him. I won't be long... Hello? Van's broken and now what if that bloke skipped it? How long ago? About 20 minutes. Good evening Morris. Where am I? Who are you? Lauren. Do I know you? Where am I? The Moors. Are you OK? The Moors? You were cold. Daddy had to carry you out. You had a crash... But why did he bring me here? Thank God for you! There's zero signal around here. Yeah, it's a real dead spot. Do you reckon you could hook me up? I wish I could but I've gotta get into town... I'll give you a lift though. Yeah huh... that's fine. If the company come early, all the better How long was I out? Must have been a few hours. Come on, you have to drink... Yeah, it's OK. I can manage. Daddy said I had to look after you. I'm sure Daddy will understand. Can I have my shirt? I was about to wash it. It's fine as it is. I need to get on the road as soon as possible. That's if my car still works... I don't know... You'll have to ask Daddy when he gets back. Of course. Daddy has all the answers... Who's Nicola? You spoke to Nicola? You said a name... When I was giving you a bath... Oh... You gave me a bath? I thought maybe she was your wife... I'm not married. That must have been something pretty sharp out there... My tyres just blew. Then the next thing I know is I was headed for the trees and off the road. You didn't think about putting on a spare? I would've, but both the front tyres were blown. Lauren have you seen my phone? I really need to make some calls. You aren't getting any signal out here. Yeah I've seen this... Can I use yours? I don't have one. I meant your land line. We don't have a land line. You don't have any kind of phone? No. What about Internet? We don't have it. How does a teenager cope without Facebook or... MySpace or whatever the hell it is you do these days? I'm not a teenager. So what do you do Jake? I'm a lawyer. I guess you get to see lots of places... Yeah... Spent most of my life on the road... All starts to look the same after a while. Hm...I hardly got further than town. I've seen cities once and lots of different places on TV though. You went to London? No, York. You've never been further than York? How come? We never had the opportunity. Never? Daddy says I'm not missing much. What about school? Daddy taught me. Really? It's not that unusual, is it? What about friends? I've got Daddy. Right... What? Nothing, it's just... Quite a view... Jesus.. Hey Champ. God, no, it's not what you think... Oh? And what am I thinking? Daddy! Thank you Jake. Yes. Thanks for keeping an eye on my daughter, Jake. Hi! Listen huh... about before... Before? Yeah when you saw me in there... Ah, forget about it! We're all red blooded males, right Jake? Well I can't thank you enough for saving my life mister...? Morris. Mister Morris. Sorry! Mister Morris. I'm just pulling your leg. Morris is fine. He's been a real gentleman. Has he? Now why would she say that Jake? Well I think I've outstayed my welcome I'll be getting out of your hair now. Are you thinking about walking? Well that's 10 miles to Sun Jake. The storm's hitting hard and there's no hotels. Why don't you sit inside here with us tonight? Well I guess I'll just drive slower this time. You won't be driving anywhere. Excuse me? Well your car's not safe for the road. Sweetie! Get the blankets for the couch. Morris, I couldn't possibly... Nonsense. It's not that I don't want to. It's just that I got work commitments and I've got to be in the city by tonight. Son. Who are you trying to impress? I'm really not trying to impress anyone. Come on. Sit down, relax. Keep warm! Besides... I couldn't just let you leave. I'm sorry? Listen, I really need to get going. Storm or not. Calm down son. Don't be so sensitive. It's just my sense of humour. You'll get used to it. Is Daddy telling bad jokes again? Get Jake a glass Sweetie. OK. Well the thing is... As a father... You know...I mean I .. I don't know if you've got kids. But I've got to look out for her. I need to know that you're keeping your hands to yourself. Yes, of course. Jesus, Morris... Have we got any pork left over? I think so. I remember when I was 20... I would have set the world on fire. Thank you. Where's Morris? Sleeping. Where's your mother Lauren? She died. I'm sorry. Hm. It's OK, I was young. So...It's just been the two of you here all alone ever since? Yeah. Just me and Daddy. I don't mean to be rude but... I don't think that's healthy. Merry Christmas! Yeah, what's with that? We always celebrate Christmas a bit early. A bit? It's September! Well Daddy doesn't want to be like anyone else. Yeah I noticed. Sleep well? Yeah. Where's my car? It's probably out in the shed. Marvellous. What are you doing? I've got a job to do. You're still recovering though... I'm fine. Besides, the bad weather has passed. You need to rest... I need to work. Here's ?140. That should cover the costs of it all. Here's my number in case it's more. Although as you haven't got a phone that's probably not much use. Fine. I'll leave it here. Make sure your dad gets it OK? Thanks for everything. Can't you stay a little bit longer? As fun as this has been... And as sad as I am that it has to end... No. Where are the keys? Maybe they're in the house... For fuck's sake! This isn't happening. I've got a once in a life time meeting And a bunch of papers that need to be signed Today is not a good day to be caught in the middle of God knows where! Do you want me to make some soup or something? Yeah, why don't you make me some soup? There's no need to be rude, I was only trying to help... Where the hell has he put my keys? Why are you so angry? You could have died out there! Die out there or spend the rest of my life in here. What's the difference? Hey! This is my home... And I'm very sorry for you. And it's Christmas today. It's not Christmas today. Not even close. It is for us. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Now. When's your dad back? I really need to find these keys. I don't know... A couple of hours maybe? Can't you wait until then? Looks like I'll have to. Morris. Morris! What is it Jerry? "Little birdie" tells me you've been selling moonshine liquor. "Little birdie"... There wouldn't be any truth to that, would there Morris? I may have shared a drink or two but I certainly haven't been selling anything. I've been hearing otherwise... And who are you gonna believe Jerry? Me or "little birdie"? Do I look like I'm joking Morris? Perhaps I'm missing something here. If you're wanting a bottle all you have to do is ask. We had 3 teenagers up in the hospital last week. After drinking a bunch of what I think was your liquor. Kids, hey?... One of them was nearly blinded. I don't sell booze to kids Jerry. Or anyone else. Your roll tax's up to date, isn't it? Is there something I can help you with Jerry? Have you really nothing better to do than to bust my chops? Cut the bullshit Morris. I know you're up to something. Just remember this: I got my eye on you. Well I'll bear that in mind. I mean it. Merry Christmas Jerry! It's September Morris! Well, that's your dad. I'll be off now. Thanks for everything. Merry Christmas! Morris, hi! Hi Jake! Great! You're still here! Yeah, I couldn't find my car keys. Well they're in the car. No, I looked there. Uh. Well don't worry, they'll turn up. And I can't find my phone either. Well, that I can help you with. Thanks. Look, I really need to get going... Can you give me a lift into town? I can come and pick up the car at some other point if that's alright? Sure, of course! No, I mean - Can we go now? Well the thing is: it's Christmas. And I can't leave Lauren on her own. Christmas is a very important time for a young girl. I understand but.. I'll take you in a couple of hours. But let's not spoil Lauren's big night, hey? Relax Jake! He taught himself. Yeah? I hear he's quite the teacher. Why don't you get up and dance Jake? Yeah that's not gonna happen. Come on! I don't wanna sound like a stuck record but I really need to get going. Come on! Morris, maybe you could teach your daughter the meaning of the word "no". Are you criticising my parenting skills Jake? Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom. Nicola, Will you marry me? It's beautiful... What are you doing? I want you to give this to me on my birthday. Oh Christ, you want me to propose in front of all your friends, don't you? I'll call you after. Don't worry, I'll be there. Promise... Cross my heart. So where are you now? Still in Yorkshire. I was gonna take a shortcut across the Moors. Where's Lauren? She's getting changed. Changed? It's a tradition we have ever since her mother died. Once a year at Christmas we like to pretend this is the 3 of us again. You're not gonna get the Ouija board out, are you Morris? Christmas is a time for family. Sure. So Lauren's gonna supper on her mother's dress. I'm sorry, what? One night a year, Lauren pretends to be her mother. And we... What we feel like is the three of us back together. Lauren pretends to be her mother? It's only a dress Jake. There's no need to get your panties in the twist. Merry Christmas Morris. Merry Christmas Baby. Excuse me. What the hell was that? What? You kissing your father. That's not normal behaviour. Don't be gross Jake, it was just a small kiss on behalf of my mother. You know what? This is insane! You two do whatever rocks your boat. I'm out of here tonight. Are you jealous? You're a sweet kid Lauren. But you've got some serious problems. Who's got serious problems Jake? No one. You're gonna be safe on the road there Morris? Under my roof you'll show some manners! You're at my fucking table now! Jesus, Morris! I'm just messing with you! Have you got ants in your pants Jake? You can't stop fidgeting. Just keen to get back into town. Are you really that keen on hitting the road? How was your food? It was great, thank you. Morris, I just wanna go. Sure, 20 minutes. Another glass... It's 10 miles away... No, no - nothing! Daddy, you first... Truth or dare? Dare, Honey. Okay. I dare you to down that glass of wine in one. Oh, come one Honey, we both know that's not much of a dare. Great, so we're playing games now? Morris you can't drink and drive! Ah! Now that sounds like a dare... You've nearly had the whole bottle. Jake at what point did you think it was OK to come into my home and start lecturing me? Forget it. Jake's go. OK Jake, truth or dare? I'm not doing this. You sound like a little child Jake! If it gets me into the truck any quicker: truth! Have you ever kissed another man? Daddy! No. Do you want me to? Why are you so sensitive Jake? Relax! I won't judge you. Imagine my relief. Now can we go? I said 20 minutes, are you fucking deaf? My turn Daddy! Sweetie. Dare! I dare you to take your bra off and give it to Jake. Fine, you win. I'm just going to wait in the truck. Oh, relax will you we're just having a laugh. Don't do that. Hey... Hey! How dare you? How dare you touch my daughter like that? How fucking dare you put your hands on my little girl like that?! You bastard. You fucking bastard! I'll fucking kill you! You touch her again you're a dead man! You hear me?! You touch her.. Daddy, Jake's gone! Gone where? He's gone! You wait here. Did you find him? I caught him. Oh God... He'll be fine. He's lucky this thing is old. Otherwise it would've taken his leg clean off. Hello? Hi Daddy. Can I come in? Yes Sweetie, sure. What are you gonna do about Jake? Well, he's not my responsibility. I could take care of him. Why, he's a grown man Sweetie. I'm sure he can take care of himself. I get lonely Daddy... You're always away, I've no idea where and... I'm left at home. Is it so wrong to want someone in my life? And you really think Jake's the one? You don't think I'm good enough for him... In a million years, he could never be good enough for you, Pumpkin. Besides, you're too young you Little Monkey. But not too young to be left on my own all day everyday... Where do you go Daddy? Can't all be work... You know, it's fine if you've met someone, you're allowed to be happy. I might be happy too. Well I don't have a girlfriend if that's what you're thinking. And Jake... Well... Well I can take him to the hospital tomorrow morning, yeah? I guess it's for the best, right... Right. Good news Jake! I'll be taking you to the hospital tomorrow. What? No I need to go now! I think it's infected. Well I've got things to do. I'll take you first thing. Where are you going? Morris, wait! Wait Morris! Morris, wait! See you later Jake! Wait! Take me with you! Morris! You know, if you're free tomorrow, maybe you could tow it somewhere? Can I have your card? I don't have a card. Doesn't matter. I'll just take your number. It's a nice watch you've got there. You'll be careful with vans these days Morris, especially commercial ones. They start fitting trackers to them. I always check. Do you even know what a tracker looks like? I've got an X-Trail. How old? Couple of years. I'll give you 2 grand for it. 2 grand? It's an X-Trail. If it's in good nick. 'You interested in paint? Do I look like I'm owning a decorating business? Everyone needs paint, Joe. Four tyres and a steering wheel, that's all I need. Nice watch you've got there. I'll sell it if you're interested. Four tyres, Morris. You sure? 60 pounds and it's yours. Stop hustling. How's Lauren? She's fine. If she's fine then ??? ain't she? No. Keep me informed about the X-Trail. Have the cash ready, I'll bring her over in a couple of days. Come on you have to rest now! No I have to go to hospital now before I loose my leg! I can look after you! Oh great, you're a doctor! Problem solved. No... You've got a license to practice medicine, is that what this is Lauren? No... Are you a member of any medical profession? Maybe you did a stint with St John's ambulance? Of course not... Then you're no fucking good to me, are you?! Why are you swearing at me? Because I'm stuck in this god forsaken shit hole with a mangled leg! Well you wouldn't have if you hadn't gone off by yourself! What did you expect me to do? Move in? No! You could have least have said goodbye... Are you crazy? After what happened last night? Are you out of your mind?! Last night? Last night was fun though... Fun? Lauren, your father tried to kill me! It was a misunderstanding! I guess you're perfect when you've had too much to drink. Get a grip on reality! I don't turn into a homicidal maniac! Neither does he! Bullshit! Do you ever wonder why your father was looking for me this morning with a shotgun? Just in case I guess... In case of what? A fucking bear attack? That at least would explain why you've got traps in the woods. Do you get many bears around here by the way? I don't know. Have you ever seen one? No. And do you think that might be because bears haven't been here since the tenth fucking century? Why are you mad at me? Because I don't want to be here! I hate you! Here are your damn keys! I'm sorry... Hey... I said I'm sorry! I'm gonna take you with me. This is detective Jerry Sullivan of Yorkshire police. Unfortunately none of our local hospitals have reported any car crash victims that match Mr. Howls' description. I'm sorry there isn't better news. Please do give me a call if you want to discuss further. Jake! Lauren. With or without you I'm leaving. You need to decide right now! Take me with you. It's gonna be OK. Come on, let's get out of here. We can go when he's asleep. Please...just stay a little longer, don't leave me here. I'm sorry, I've got to go. I'll come back for you. Come on! We can take his truck tonight. Hello Champ. Hi Daddy. We were just getting some air. You found your keys Jake? You're gonna be leaving us then? In the morning. Oh that's a shame. We're gonna miss you. Come on Jake, let's get you inside. We've had 3 patrols in this area. We should still keep focusing on this road. It's where he crashed. We don't know if he did. I do. Usually, when there's a crash there's a car. And in this instance we haven't found one. How can you be so sure it's this road specifically? You ready? Where's Morris? He's sleeping. What about the keys of the truck? Wait. There's something I need to get. Daddy stop it! Leave him alone! Go inside. I said go inside! Now! I won't ask you again Sweetie. After everything I did for you this how you repay me. You tried to steal my truck and kidnap my daughter. What the hell is wrong with you son? What are you doing? You've only got yourself to blame Jake. Your parents must be so disappointed in you. Mo-Morris, don't... No... No, no no no. Don't Morris. Morris! No! Did you kill him? How could you say something like that to me? Did you? Of course not. What did I ever do to make you want to run away?... He's poisoned you against me. Don't you see? I promise you Pumpkin... Everything's gonna be OK. What did you do to Jake? He's fine. Then get him back here. Tim. Oh, 'morning. I was hoping for some news. Oh, we've had a van reported missing. Might be connected, might be nothing. And huh, my shift's here in over an hour so... So I guess I could do some more house to house inquiries. I'll join you. 'Morning Jake. Take these fucking chains off me! Where's Lauren? I don't see how that's your concern. Did you kill her? Is that what you would do? Where is she? You've got a real attitude problem Jake, you know that? So I guess I'm gonna be your guest a little while longer. Anything I can do to make your stay more comfortable? How's the leg by the way? Let me know if you need any more pain killers. I found these in your pocket. You've well and truly crossed the line this time Morris. You can't cover this one up. Are you listening to me? You can't put this down as an accident or self-defence. You've tortured a person. That's actual bodily harm. Premeditated I might add. And you've kept me here against my will. That's forcible confinement. And I can see you've taken my watch and that's theft. Some sort of lawyer aren't you Jake? And God knows what you've got down there but I'm willing to bet it ain't legal. Oops... So tell me Jake, What is your point? It means you're gonna go to jail for a long time. OK, so what's gonna happen to Lauren? I'll tell you. Inside, a month you'll be peddling her ass to grease your fucks to get their kicks from young girls! Of sort of guys like you hey? Oh you've got to laugh, right? But that doesn't matter to you, does it? No, 'cause you're in your own little fucked-up Morris World! In the middle of nowhere, amongst the trees. Well, guess what: sooner or later they are gonna find you. And when they do they're gonna lock you up and throw away the key. Maybe. But let me ask you something. Did you tell anyone you were coming here? Hm? Did you tell a single person you'd be driving down that road? The one that I found you on when I saved your miserable worthless life? I don't think so, Jake. And you know what that means, don't you? It means no one's looking for you here. So maybe you're right. Maybe one day, this will all catch up with me. But not today. And not in time to save you. But Lauren, she won't let you kill me. She likes me. And as much as that pisses you off she has feelings for me. And she's not just gonna stand by and let this happen. Oh, I'm terrified. What do you think my daughter's gonna say to me Jake? She's gonna tell me off? Sulk? Hold her breath until she gets her way? She'll do as I'll tell her. And that's a fact. OK. I'm sorry. Alright? I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I realise I've been ungrateful and rude having shown you no respect in your own home when all you've been is the greatest host. And I kinda see that Lauren is young and impressionable and I've been a negative influence on her. And for all of that I am sorry! Okay. I get it, alright? If it was the other way around, I'd do the same, maybe even worse. You're just a concerned father looking out for his daughter am I right? And I've come into your home and without any consideration I've disturbed the peace you have here. Maybe.. Maybe I have took things too far. Right...Right! Well, I've realised I made a mistake. I appreciate that. You're a bigger man than I took you for, Jake. I'm truly sorry for my actions. So do you forgive me? Of course. And I hope that you can forgive me if at times I took it too far. It's all water under the bridge. So will you let me go? No. What? Go fuck yourself, Jake. Where are you going? Out. You're not leaving me here like this you fuck! I'm finished. I'm not fucking finished with you! This isn't over! I'm gonna destroy you! I'm gonna do whatever it takes! I will move heaven and earth to get out of this shit hole you call a home! And when I do, I'm gonna take everything that has about any importance to you and rip it from your life. I'm gonna burn this fucking hovel down and piss on the ashes! And most importantly, if it's the last thing I ever do, I'm gonna make sure that Lauren despises you. You're nothing. You're worthless! You're pathetic! You have to hide out here in the middle of nowhere because all you are is a SICK FUCK! I am going to destroy you! Do you fucking hear me?! Howdy doody, Jerry. Morris. You're head's bleeding. I slipped. Ah, oh, sure. What do you want, Jerry? We think we had a car crash in the area, few days ago. But we can't find it. Nor the driver. Any ideas? Aliens. Seriously, Morris? Oh, maybe not this time of the year, right. Well my guess is: somebody towed it away. You won't happen to know anything about that? You know, we're kind of cut off up here. Well its not exactly the local watering hole, is it? Right. I'll leave you to it then. You slipped on your knuckles too then, did you? Who's your friend? None of your business . Is something wrong Jerry? Care to explain Morris? Cans of paint, Jerry. Didn't they teach you that in detective school? You still have the receipts of course? Of course. Mind if I see them? Looks like you're off duty, Jerry. Are you sure you came here to say hi or just... Or just to bust my balls some more? Cut the shit Morris. No problem. I'll be right back. Jake. Jake! That's Jake's car! What? It's his car! Are you sure? Yes. Get in the car. Get in the car! Is there something I can help you with officer? Hm? Are you still keeping an eye on me, Jerry? Bitch! I thought you were dead. Come on, let's get you out of here. Jesus... Who is he? I don't know... We can take his car. There's no keys. Check his pockets. They're not in here. Come on, old friend. He's gonna kill me. I won't let him. He's not gonna take a vote on it. It's gonna be fine, Jake. He's just killed a man. It must have been self-defence. Look at me. Does this look like self-defence? He won't do it again. And who else has he got in that basement? What basement? The basement in the shed. The shed's Daddy's space, he doesn't like me going in there. You need to find out what or who he's got in there. It's too risky! If he finds out... Once we're gone, he'll destroy all the evidence. Well let him! At least we'll be free and he can stay here where he belongs. He belongs in prison. I can't do it. You've got to. Daddy... How's the arm? Barely a scratch. I'll be fine. It's been a crazy couple of days, hey? What happened this morning? Nothing for you to worry about, Sweetie. We aren't in trouble, are we? Trouble? Why would we be in trouble? I don't know... It's just things have never been like this before. Well you haven't done anything, have you? No. Then there's nothing to worry about, is there, Sweetie? OK. Daddy, what's gonna happen to Jake? I'll take him to the hospital in the morning. For real this time? Of course. Really? Well, what else would I do? Yeah, no, of course. I know things have been tough lately. I realise now why you've been protecting me. People can't be trusted. Once Jake goes, things will be back to normal. It'll all be OK. Sometimes I forget how grown up you are. You're just like your mother. Don't let it get cold, Sweetie. Eat to live, Jake. Well the polite thing to do would be to say "thank you". How's your leg? Is this pork again Daddy? Sure Sweetie. Now, what's wrong? You don't like pork now? No, it's fine. Well I can make you something else if you prefer. How did Lauren's mother die? Not at the diner table, please Jake. You killed her too, didn't you? I'm guessing... I'm guessing she tried to take Lauren away from you and this shit hole you call a home. Jake. But being the fucking nutcase that you are, you weren't too happy about it. She tried to escape didn't she? And that's why you killed her. Yeah. I know you killed her you fucking psychopath. Are your parents still alive, Jake? Maybe I can pay them a visit. It was cancer. That's right, Sweetie. That's right, Sweetie, it was cancer. What happened to the body, Morris? Did the authorities come and take her away? Hm? Where's the death certificate? She was cremated. I'm sure it was a beautiful ceremony. Do you remember the funeral, Lauren? Excuse me, I'm gonna get some air. Eat your food, Jake. Eat to live, right? I hear you're taking me to the hospital tomorrow. Lauren told you that? No rush. I've seen we've passed the point saving my leg. Maybe I'll stay here for another day or two... See the new year with you guys... Hm. I know your humour now. I forgot. We can't get anything past you, can we? You're too smart. I've been wanting to have a chat with you. Man to man. Now, as a father, the most important thing to me is my daughter's welfare and happiness. So when a man comes along and and tries to take her away from me, exploit her innocence... Morris.. I have no intentions of your daughter, when are you gonna get that in your thick fucking.. Sorry to interrupt you there, but that's not my point. That's not what upsets me the most. What it is, if you like, besides seeing you emotionally manipulate my daughter, is for you to come into my house and blatantly lie. You see, it's the disrespect that I'm having a tough time with. Yeah well, whatever. You led my daughter to believe that you were available. That you were single. That you didn't have a girlfriend, Jake. That you didn't have a fiancee. What did you say? Didn't get a chance to talk to him, did you? Didn't get a chance to find out who he is. You didn't get a chance to spill the beans before I spilled his guts. You see, that was Jerry, our local constabulary. He - he came here. Looking for you. So I guess that's me eating my words. Somehow, someone did know that you were here. But he didn't come on his own. Who did he come with? I hope I didn't get you into trouble but I told her about you and Lauren. Who was he with? Now, I tried to explain it to her. But it almost broke my heart. What have you done to her?! You son of a bitch! Sweet girl. Hm, no. Wait, I'd say... "Tender", is a better description. Maybe even 'succulent'. What have you done to her?! Tell me Jake, how did she taste to you? NOOOO!!! Here, I don't think it'll fit her anymore. Oh God... What did you do? What did you do?! You're too young to understand. This is my mother. Isn't it? How could you do that? It was the only way to protect you. She was gonna take you away. You know now what kind of world it is out there. Jake was right about you... About everything.. Don't say that, Sweetie. I don't know you! I don't know the person that could do this. You need to calm down... You're a monster! That's not true... You're a monster! She can't move! Sweetie, I'm begging you to calm down. She can't speak! Turned her life into a nightmare! Don't make me do this! What? What are you gonna do? I'm not playing around, here! Are you gonna cut off my arms and legs so I can't run away?! I'm warning you! Then cut off my tongue so I can't tell you "I HATE YOU"! I'm warning you! What did she see? I told you. If it's the last thing I do, I'd make sure that she hates you. She knows what you are now. I'm ready. WHYYY?!! FUCK! DAMN YOU FUCK!!! Are you OK? What did you see? We're not getting out of here, are we?... We should have walked when we'd had the chance... It's not over yet. I did my best to raise her. To keep her happy and protected.
