"Lao, where are you?" "Lao, where are you?" You don't see what I look like now Did you forget about it? Where did Lao go? She disaapeared And then? And then I've never looked at the mirror ever since That's it for today Tao When did Lao pass away? When she was young?

What am I supposed to expect for tomorrow I've had enough I've had enough of this wheelchair I wanted a normal life Like everybody else Let's go to the mirror room together But mommy told me there's a demon inside the mirror That's not true Mommy is selfish She just wants to keep the mirrior to herself She'll be mad if she finds out We could sneak in!

Sometimes it's more important than us You are also one of the flowers. Yeah! Do you have any wishes - Greenhouse girl? What can I do for you? What can I do for you? I've talked to the hospital Please ask them to make an decision soon It's been tough on them. The new antibiotic is not working anymore If you don't have an operation within a month Your life is coming to an end Hi "Yes, what's up" What did you do last night Nothing How is our girl doing today?

He probably had paint in his veins instead of blood. Sorry My sister became the same as well She always smelled like turpentine Couldn't wash it out You are talking about Lao? I saw the height masurement on the wall overthere There's one that just stops My sister drew it when she was young Lao She's better than me in every way She's good at playing piano and painting For real?

I don't like you being like this You may leave No I have to finish the painting I must meet Lao Is Lao in there? No "This way, Doctor" Your heart can't wait anymore There's only one that can be saved Make your decision We've been chatting for a long time I want to be with him Even just for a month To meet him in person Listen to his voice I'll be satisfied "What are you talking about, sis" I don't want to die before falling in love What's the point of living But But we are sisters How can we decide? An operation for two of us Can't make both of you live healthly Let Luhai go Let's not give him a hard time No I won't let him go Hello? When we were young Our parents gave us things. One for each of us But I want to have something unique I want to have My own love This is the only way - I'll be able to feel my own existence. I must know his choice Only the one he loves Can be saved Lao "Lao, Tao where are you guys" where's Lao? Where's Lao Where are you two?
