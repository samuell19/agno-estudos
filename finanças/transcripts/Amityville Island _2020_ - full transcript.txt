Amityville's a dump and people can't move out fast enough. That's two good reasons why it's perfect for a newly single mom with four kids. I wish you hadn't moved there. There are a lot of stories about that place. Well, I'm out of options since Russel was killed in Iraq, you know that. I know. I just wish things had turned out differently for you Kelly Jo. Thanks Mom. You know what? Things are already looking up. I'm about to clean out this really nice rummage sale. Then I gotta pick up the kids from daycare. Then I'll talk to you later. Okay. You got a lot of stuff available this late in the day. Do you mind if I use this? I'm gonna need it. Help yourself. As a mom of four, I look for deals where I can. I wish I knew this house was for sale before I moved here. Is that supposed to be a joke? No. Should it be? It's just, things have happened here. The owners are gone. I'm the realtor actually. Nobody wants this house and nobody wants the stuff in it. I can't be picky. Give me all of it. I did what you said, I did what you said! How did you jump in there? I don't remember putting you in there. You're definitely not something I'd give to the kids. Ah. Melanie? It was a late deadline, baby. I'm sorry. Oh. Melanie? Melanie! Oh. Warden Valentine's office. This is Eric Kates calling for the warden again. And what is this in reference to? Same thing it was last time and the time before that. It's about Kelly Jo Knight being on death row. I'd really like to get an interview with her. Yes, Warden Valentine asked me to tell you that prisoner Knight is indisposed. Indisposed? She's been on death row for over a year. What could she possibly be doing? Looks like we got a couple of death row cuties here tonight. Renata here is the reigning champ of fight night so she knows the rules. Winner goes back to their cell. Loser goes somewhere you don't want to be and you may never come back. Put up a good fight for our audience or you both go to the red box and you stay there for a month until you come back and fight again. You've heard about the red box all across the yard, but don't worry, the rats step on the cockroaches and the snakes eat the rats. Those snakes, oh those snakes. All right, we got pervs paying good money for this stream so fight! Come on, you don't want the box. You're the one that killed your four kids right? What, you don't want to fight an adult? I'm gonna get the chair for the people I killed. I'm never gonna have a chance to have kids, but if I did I wouldn't throw them away like you. Oh shit, now it's on. All right, that's enough. Get her! Send 'em both to the island. Where are you taking us? You can't do this. I want to talk to my lawyer. Your lawyer got you a date with old sparky. I don't think you need to be calling your lawyer right now. Gonna miss you at fight night sweetheart. Five time champ. And it makes you wonder how she didn't fight off those guys she said raped her. Probably into it. Not how it happened. Ah, we ain't ever gonna know now are we sugar? You burned down that frat house, killed 23 guys. She said it was five guys who had done it. Maybe it was 23 guys. I'd hate to think she accidentally killed all those innocent people. 23 guys though and one hell of a train. - Shit! - Kill you, I'm going to kill you. Get off me, get off me! God dammit, get her off me! Hey! Get back here! Run! Stay here, I'll get her. Where, where am I? Huh? Fuck this. Come on, babe. You know the drill. What the fuck? Come on! Dammit, I told you to run. - Where's Hayden? - Gone. Just gone. That little pussy. He's gonna get his ass chewed by the warden if and when he gets back. I ain't waitin'. You, no more tricks. And you, I wasn't sure you could even talk, but now that you are shut up! Get in. Shit. Come on, get out. Where are you taking us? Dinner cruise, get in. Kelly Jo, are you all right? Ah, there's that frigid little child killer we've all grown to love. Bipolar much? This is Kates. Kates, it's Guerrera at the magazine. Yeah? Hey, everybody here is wondering how you're doing? If you're feeling like maybe coming back to work? Yeah boss, I am. If you're ready to put me on those Amityville murders. You know this isn't that kind of magazine Eric. It could be. Somebody needs to connect the dots on those Amityville killings. There's no dots to connect. It's been a bunch of random killings. - Sad, but random. - You don't know. - You weren't there. - That's the problem Eric. You're too close to it. What happened to Melanie when she went and shot up that diner. You don't understand, that wasn't her. It happened later. Something changed after she cleaned out that first murder house. I'm sorry Eric. Maybe it's not time to come back yet. No, but it is time to find out what's happening. Welcome to Fantasy Island. Get out. Two this time? Double the fun. Jeez, what was that? Insurance. A tracking device, also a poison capsule that can be snapped in two remotely if you wander off too far or walk in front of the microwave while it's running. You might want to avoid the break room. We only have one holding cell for the specimens. 57 has just ended their experiment yesterday and nobody has cleaned up. Oh, one's of them's pretty quiet. Mom of the year there, killed her four kids, pretty much keeps to herself. The other one burned down a frat house after a bad date. Wiped out a bunch of rich kids. But that's not really a bad thing. She's a feisty one. I didn't ask for their history. We only need the uterus. You and me both brother, happy slicing. Ow. That's not all those implants can do, come on. Hey, that asshole shot me. You're going to have to do something about this. You won't want to ask for the knife, believe me. They're penned up now, but even if you're not swayed by your implants we do let the dogs out at night and they've been raised on leftovers from the lab. If you decide to get clever run towards the dogs, don't run away. Not even the dogs go on that side of the island. Come on, Hayden. You don't want your balls in the ringer. Pick up. What the? We don't need a bigger boat, we need a bigger gun. Ha! Don't bring pointy teeth to a gun fight. What's wrong with her? What do you think? She's crazy. She killed a bunch of people just like me. Plus she's from Amityville so what're you gonna do? Half the town thinks it's possessed by a demon and the other half thinks that the first half's trying to kill them. Come on now, we need to meet Dr. Ormond. Ah, 58. And I see we welcome a 59 too. I expect the warden's gonna want double pay for this shipment. Well, when we have such prime specimens why not pay the going rate? Let's not split hairs Dr. Tyler over a few bobbles. This one's got a shoulder wound. Splitting hairs Dr. Tyler. Welcome. Welcome to our island and our little laboratory. What is going on here? Nothing more than the future. The future of what? Why, the human race. And of course your future. Unless you enjoy living out your remaining days with the warden's perverse form of natural selection? You both had dates with the machinery of justice and were in the shadow of capital punishment. Here you can contribute to science. More specifically, the problems of infertility. All right, if this place is above board then why do you have to get women off of death row? And then why are you hiding out on a tiny island? Well, Dr. Tyler here had some predilections that are frowned upon in the more restrictive medical communities. And I, well I have the opposite problem. Most won't admit that a total lack of empathy for human test subjects is a good thing. The hour is getting late. Tomorrow is the first day of a new chapter in the rest of your life. I can't say our accommodations are better than the prison, as I have never been there, but we do promise a more collaborative atmosphere. Don't let her touch that. Get 58 away from there. What, you don't want to fight an adult? I'm gonna get the chair for people I killed. I'm never gonna have a chance to have kids, but if I did I wouldn't throw them away like you. Dammit Ellison, pick up. If you two are out there goofing off instead of hightailing it back here you're gonna lose your cellblock harem privileges. High quality dirt bags are getting harder and harder to find. Dammit Ellison, look at porn on your own freaking computer. What the hell? If you stay calm you'll get fed. I don't think we're in the prison anymore are we? Nope. And you're house didn't get picked up by a tornado either, sunshine. I think I liked you better as a vegetable. I don't like that look you're giving me though. Well, they were not expecting two of us so... I don't think I'm gonna get much sleep anyway. We have to find a way out of here. Oh, they weren't kidding about those dogs. 58 did something to that computer. It has very important files on all of our specimens on it. Make sure we haven't lost anything and don't wake me unless there's an emergency. We have a long day tomorrow. So they asked me to keep a video diary. Day one, I guess. I know what I did was wrong and I'm here to repay for that. What I did was I bombed an abortion clinic and the fire from it spread to the neighborhood killing a lot of people. I plead guilty and I was expecting to go on death row when I got a visit from these science geeks and they said if I did their project, if I was involved voluntarily with their experiment one year I'd be free, done. I'm thinking this has gotta be some kind of MKUltra government something or other, but beats waiting around for a few decades to die right. Anyway, so here I am. They keep saying what I did was wrong. But it was God that told me to bomb the abortion clinic and I really believe that it is God that brought me to this fertility clinic to do the right thing. Dr. Ormond calls me specimen 44. He actually calls me that like it's my name, but my real name is Tammica, or Tammy. Tammy. Tammy. Remember that chick that pulled the train at the party last night? Hey babe. Can I get a dirty chai, extra shots, whipped cream if you got it? I gotta get more whipped cream. Hey dude, remember that chick that pulled the train at the house party last night? Yeah. She works at this coffee shop I stopped at dude. No, she was passed out by the time I got there, but I was like four or five in. I was absolutely trashed. Hello? Renata, it's Clarice. Are you okay? You sound sick. No, I'm fine. Well that's cool because I need to ask you for a huge favor. I've got a big catering gig and Sophie couldn't make it. I can't, I'm at my job. Your second other job, or your third other job? - The barista job. - No, that's cool. Mostly I need somebody to go get my pickup and drive it over to this wedding. All of the sudden they need extra steaks grilled and I've got like five propane tanks in the bed. Do you think you could call Andy? - We broke up. - Oh, I'm sorry. Not your day I guess. I guess not. Wait. Did you say five propane tanks? Come on now. Where are you taking her? My colleague wanted you, but I haven't had my coffee yet. I don't want to deal with your shit. I'll tell him I got your numbers mixed up. What the hell is going on here? Believe me, you'll just want to hang out here. How much did you give her? I thought enough. It will have to be. We aren't getting more anesthetic unless we start showing results. Be proud to be a part of our grand experiment. An experiment to create the next generation of mankind. But first, we need a womb fit for a god. This is Warden Valentine's office. This is Eric Kates for Warden Valentine. I called yesterday. Warden Valentine is taking personal leave. I don't believe that. He was just there yesterday. I'm sorry, sir. This is unacceptable. I'm trying to get an interview with Kelly Jo Knight. She's my, she's our only living link to what's been going on in Amityville. And what's that Mr. Kates? Murders, and not tied to a single location or a single person. We may be talking about cursed objects or something that is passed between people like a virus. And Kelly Jo Knight is the only person that can shed light on this. What magazine did you say you were with, sir? I'm working as a freelancer on this one. I see. Someone will get back with you, sir. Ah. - Editor's desk. - It's Kates. I'm on my way to the prison. You sure that's the best thing to do right now? Something is happening there. Something to Kelly Jo Knight and the warden. I'm gonna find out what it is. Eric. Just call ahead Guerrera and get me a media pass. I'm en route. What'd they do to you? Hey, she's sick. You can't leave her like this. Hey! Something isn't right. It's just the fertility drugs. She'll be fine. And if not we have you. Kelly Jo, hey. Kelly Jo, we need to get out of here. We gotta get out of here. I don't know exactly what I'm asking. Or who I'm asking. Kelly Jo, hey Kelly Jo. Come on, get up, let's go. Let's go, come on. Move it! Wait. We don't know what these implants do and what the range is. Looks like a RadioShack threw up in here. I don't even know where to start. I do know the doctor didn't want us messing with his computer though. There are tons of files on here. Look at this one, 44. It's been accessed hundreds of times. Dr. Tyler told me exactly what is going on. He isn't this fertility specialist. He's a clone expert. And not just any ordinary everyday cloning, if that is a real thing, he specializes in the super soldier. So, where do you get super soldiers to grow from? That's the main problem that they are facing. So I admit that I killed a lot of mothers when I firebombed that clinic, but this is the way to make things right. This is how I'm gonna make my penance. This is how... This is the reason why I did all of that to begin with because by cleansing them from the Earth, by cleansing them from this world entirely I get to usher in a new stronger humanoid race. I get to be the new Mary to the new God. The pain is great. And glorious. I think that my doctor, Tyler... This is for you Dr. Tyler. What did they do to me? Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here and then find a real doctor. We just gotta figure out how to get these damn implants out of our necks. Did you think the plans would be in a Word document or something? Like we were cut rate Bond villains? The implants don't come out. There's no reason for them to. I never have understood humans and their feelings. That is why I went into nanotechnology. Those little implants. Yours are so big. They can administer shocks, poison. Now you have nanotech rebuilt in your uterus into a superstructure. And when the time is right they will release fertilized eggs that will grow into Tyler's superior race of humans. I will be disappointed however if they all have his face. No! One day the name Ormond and Tyler will be said in the same breath as Watson and Crick are when one speaks of DNA. Only better and with more reverence. For we will usher in the next evolution in humankind. She got one of those things in me, god dammit. How did she? You foolish, foolish man. Don't tell me you found another Tammy. There... There will never be another Tammy. She did love a terrible and twisted god so I can see the attraction. Come here. All right, come on, let's go. They said we weren't doctors anymore and now we're acting like it. Something got into my brain. And something else got into your pants. And see where that lead us? Release the dogs and then go chase the specimens down. I'm not going out there with those dogs. As you know, they too only have a taste for female flesh. Try winging them. Aim away from the vagina for once. Hopefully we're gonna find the water. Nothing. They will make for the beach. How come I'm the one out here doing this? You tainted the specimens. You broke it, you buy it, huh? Didn't copy that. The prisoners always turn on their masters. Dr. Tyler! We gotta find a boat. A canoe, a rowboat, pontoon, dingy, something. We gotta follow the shore line. Kelly Jo, it's gonna be okay, all right? We just gotta follow the shoreline, all right? Let's go. Dr. Tyler? Dr. Tyler? You froze too many clone embryos, got ambitious, should've thought about job security. Now I'm in the line of fire and I'm the only one that knows a jot about nanotechnology. Now where did we put that accursed gun? No dogs. So they've left the beach, gone north. This is not a great day for science. You're specimen nine aren't you? I remember you well. You were young and strong. You should've been the perfect vessel save for one mistake, we gave you too many nanobots. Now we know to only insert them in the uterus otherwise they overwhelm the body. I thought the nanobots would eventually kill you. I wonder how you are still ambulatory. The nanotech we applied relies on living tissue to do its work. You should've expired long ago. Of course, you are acquiring living tissue. You have evolved. As much as I'm proud of my contributions to science you are a beautiful perfect thing. Okay, we gotta find out what's going on here. If somebody has a rifle on this island then we should probably get it ourselves. Come on, let's go. Nothing. Nothing. Come on. Is it... I don't know what the hell happened. I have been possessed by something. It made a mistake, jumped from me into something that was neither alive or dead. I don't think it can come back. I think I'm free. But free to do what? First thing's first, we gotta go catch that boat. Okay. We can't go back to Amityville. Nobody there will understand. I have a feeling they might. We're not gonna risk it though okay? We just stay on the shoreline and just keep going up north. And not run out of gas, we'll hit Canada, okay? - Come on, it's coming. - Are you sure, are you sure? - It's coming. - Are you sure? Okay, I'm gonna go get some water and towels, okay? It's coming now. Okay, all right, let's do this. You can do it. - Okay? - Okay, okay. All right, just breathe, breathe. Breathe. Push. Push. Oh, I see it, I see it. - I need to push. - Okay, push. The baby's coming. It's... It's... What, what, what?
