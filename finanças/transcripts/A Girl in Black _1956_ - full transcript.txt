HERMES FILM presents ELLIE LAMBETTI DIMITRI HORN in a film by Michael Cacoyannis A GIRL IN BLACK I love these barren island rocks... This land! It's as if everything is exposed to the light. - Nothing remains hidden. - "Not even men's sins..." Who said that? You'll be better off in a house. - What do you think? - A hotel's more comfortable. But the dreary people one meets... A few sour looks and they'll keep away. We could split up, if you like... - I'll get you fixed up nicely. - Please, Pavlo... Marina! They have one of the big, old houses. How about it? - Fine with me. - Just a minute. Shall we toss for it? Wait! These gentlemen are here for a few days. They'd like to stay at your place. Well, I don't know if... Your mother asked me to try... for the upstairs rooms. Did you explain the house is old and rather dilapidated? Who cares? They're young. - Lf the young lady doesn't... - May we see it? Yes... Excuse me. She's telling her brother, Mitso. - Not very talkative is she? - A bit stand-offish... You see her Dad was a merchant, one of the island's rich. Then came the war and goodbye glory, as they say. - When did he die? - During the occupation. The mother's different. More down-to-earth. Lodgers. Come on up. - At least the view's nice. - Didn't I tell you? Which room will you take? I don't care. This one... Unless you'd rather have it. - It's a beautiful house. - It used to be. I like these old houses. They've got atmosphere. - Is that your mother? - My sister. - You have a sister? - She's dead. - Where shall I put these? - Over here. If you need anything, mother won't be long. She's out on an errand. - Here you go. - I'll drink to your health. And always at your service. Great! We left Athens to relax, have fun... and we wind up in this house of gloom! You've become so picky... but then success does that! I just didn't come here to be depressed. Is that why you chose my company? You still find me amusing after all these years? Very. Except when you get all worked up... and make stupid cracks about success etcetera... Good to know I'm of some use! An amusing nonentity! - Not bad! - I'm not in the mood! At least I've no illusions about myself. That's something, isn't it? What are you asking me for? You know what I think. That you're making up excuses. You can afford not to work so why bother? It's not as if you've no talent, damn it! So I wrote two novels by age 20! Big deal! You can't be a child prodigy for ever. Some child! With gray hair. If I had it in me, I'd have made it. You bore me. Seriously... If you prefer to go to a hotel... Know what I think? You're trying to get rid of me because of the girl. - Light. - You smoke too much. And drink too much. I left my mother to have you boss me? How about a swim? The cold water will do you good. Mimi! Come out! You'll catch cold! Wait till we go back to Athens! No movies, no ice-cream! Go away, you bums! Antigone! Up in the castle! Phroso again... in the ruins. Yorgo! Come here at once! It's her son Mitso I'm afraid of. Remember the last time? Serve her right. She was asking for it. The slut! We weren't widowed at 32! If she needed a man she should have remarried. With three kids and all those debts? What are you staring at? Scram! If you want a kiss or more go knock on a widow's door. Speak up or I'll pull it off! Ask your mother... What? Ask what? They caught her with a man. At the castle... in the ruins... I'll kill her! Everyone's laughing at us! I'll kill her! Hello, Popi. Let go of me I said! I'll kill her! I swear I will! No, Mitso, no! Not your own mother! I'll kill you! Let go of me! What are you ironing? Why don't you talk to me? Talk to me, Marina, please! Call me names... Say I'm cheap, rotten... Only please talk to me. Oh God, what am I to do? I don't mean to... I swear. How can I make you understand? At your age I was married... I had three children... At times I get so lonely... I can't help myself... When your father died... I was still young... I needed a little kindness... affection... I've shamed my own children! If only I could go away. Excuse me. I want some water... I'll get it. This gentleman and his friend have rented the upstairs rooms. My mother. - It's a pleasure. - Likewise. Thank you. Sir... The name's Pavlo. If you want to move elsewhere, we'll understand. Whatever for? After what... You mean those fools out there? They should mind their own business. I don't know about you but I've so many weaknesses... I've given up judging others. Don't let me start counting them... your hair will stand on end. Truly! I don't approve of me at all! - Don't you believe me? - You're very kind. Got to go. Antoni's waiting for the water. He's an old fusspot. Nag-nag... I hope we'll be friends. - Hello, Panagis. - Hello, friend. Mitso's got wind of something. Some kid recognized you. You're scaring me! Someone hide me, quick! What's the joke, men! We were talking about Phroso. Old hens are the juiciest, right! What does her stuck-up daughter have to say now? What can she say? Her turn will come... you wait... Lay off, Christo. Teach her to treat us like dirt. Get used to the idea. You're not her type. He's always hanging around her house. No wisecracks from you. She's at Mrs. Betsou's... helping her with some curtains. Mr. Know-all! How about a little fun? - Where's the gang? - At the coffee house. We're going serenading tonight, by moonlight. - Shall we ask the Athenians? - It's not their style... Softies! Does she treat them like dirt too? Or will the city-boys get her? He's really pissed. Thank you, Marina. Good-night. What are we waiting for? We're not good enough for her. What a doll! Talk to us even if you don't love us! Why isn't she talking to us? She's scared of her mother. What's your hurry, baby? Let the Athenians wait. How's Phroso? Leave us alone! What have we done to you? - What's going on? - A fight. Panagis and Mitso. He sprang a knife at me. He's lying! Is this your knife, Mitso? Yes. Lock him up... The bastard! You both come with me. Shame on you, guys! - You go home. - I'll go with you. Home, I said. - Good evening, Marina. - Good evening. Hurry up. I'm going... What is it? What happened? I hate them! I hate them! - Who? - All of them! Someone hurt you? Please... Don't... I want to go away. Come on now... A brave girl like you... What's wrong? Want to join us for a stroll? You'll feel better. Wait for me at the taverna. She'll be all right. Don't be long. Ready? I'll make you laugh if it kills me. I beseech you, I implore you. Smile! On my knees I beg you. A teeny-weeny smile. At last. You should laugh more often. You're more beautiful when you laugh. Don't you want to be beautiful? - No. - Why not? Are you angry? You're trembling. Why? I want to kiss you again. Don't. What is it? What's wrong? - Nothing. It's nothing. - What is it? I'm fine now. You scared me. I must go. Don't tell anyone, please! What's the matter? Nothing. You're telling me! I can read you like a book. - Be careful, that's all. - Of what? Don't make her fall for you. It's not fair. Who says I won't fall for her? Try and be serious. She's unhappy enough already. Why hurt her? - I hate being preached at! - You know I'm right. If I always did what was right, I'd have killed myself a long time ago. The boys invite you to come serenading with us. Thanks. We don't have the voices for it. - We may go sailing later. - Some other time. Thanks. The boys won't like this. And for good reason. Meaning? Poking a little fun at a girl... is no reason for you to take offence. If you're out for a fight, say so. What's bitten him? We said thank you, no singing. Must we apologize on top of everything? Now who's itching for a fight? Don't mind him. He gets a little edgy sometimes. Anyway, thank you. And good-night. Good-night. Sweet dreams. - You're mad! Who needs trouble? - Scared you, huh? You knew I'd play it down so you had to show off! All of a sudden I feel great. - Waiter! A cognac! - You've drunk enough! So what? We can't all be perfect. Let yourself go! Live a little! Break a few rules before it's too late! - You're drunk or in love! - What if I am? I'll enjoy it while it lasts. Ten, fifteen days... And to hell with the rest. Right, Manolaki? You see? Her health! Want a laugh? What is it? What are you doing? Come away, you idiot! - See you at lunchtime. - 'Bye. What are they doing? They'll drown him! Leave him alone! You'll drown him! Who is it? Help! Mimis! I'm right here, Mom! Stop yelling! They say he was dead drunk. Rowdy lot! Teach us not to take strangers in. Good-morning. Don't mind me, please. - Don't go. - I must. You know I've barely heard your voice. You let me do all the talking. - What's there to say? - Anything. About your life, your dreams. You must have dreams. I've learnt not to. You're too young to be so bitter. Why don't you tell me about it? We're friends aren't we? - Don't you trust me? - Yes. Look me in the eyes and say it. Yes. - Dear God! - What is it, Marina? - You mustn't love me. - Why not? - You don't want me to... - No! But it's all so difficult. I'm scared they'll find out and something bad will happen. Nothing bad will happen. Believe me. - Love is joy. - Not in this house. We're hounded by shame... hate... death... Do you have a sister? Yes. - Is she pretty? - Quite. Mine wasn't... poor darling. "You are", I'd tell her. "You've a pretty smile." And she'd say... "Fortunately, you're pretty enough for the two of us." And she'd kiss me. It's terrible to die because you're plain. How did she die? She drowned. When? Ayear ago. She'd left her clothes folded on the beach... as though she'd gone swimming. People said it was an accident. But I know. - She was in love. - With whom? One of them... Christo. - What about him? - He didn't love her... He just led her on so that... What? So that he could keep seeing us both. One day he asked to see me. Niki was in the next room. We were glad because we thought he'd come... When he said he loved me and I threw him out... he shouted... "Did you think I could ever love that..." - Don't... - No, I'll say it. "That freak." "She's..." He said more. Loudly. In a loud voice. When I went back to Niki's room... she didn't say a word. A week later... she was dead. Three months after she died... he asked me to marry him. Since then they won't leave me alone. Marina, my love. If only we could live without fear... for a day... just time enough for a walk. - It's not too much to ask. - We'll have our walk. - How are you? - Fine thanks. - We're going on a picnic. - Have fun. - You're sketching? - Just killing time. - You're an artist? - No, an architect. - And your friend? - He's a writer. He's not quiet like you. People say he's a playboy. Well? - Will you be staying long? - A week. Why? We'll be needing the rooms. When? Today if possible... I'll tell my friend but I don't know how he'll take it. I don't care. My sister's name means more than her life. We'll move to the hotel. He told me quite bluntly. Just don't get my back up or else! You didn't have to agree, did you? You should have listened to me. - Why couldn't he tell me? - Stop yelling. Be careful. - You're leaving. - But I'll see you... Where? - D'you have any razor-blades? - No. - You tell me. - It's impossible. - We must send for Aristides. - Yes. At night, when... - Can I be of help? - No, thank you. - I'm sorry you're leaving. - Can't be helped. - What are you doing? - Shaving. I'll never see you again. - You must... - Where? - The pine-trees over the bay. - They'll see us. - The beach... - They'll see us. The castle... the ruins... If you love me. I wish I were dead. Now you've had your way... I hope you're satisfied. I love her. What now? I suggest we catch the next boat home. Scrubbing floors, that's what I've come to. I'm fed up. The house is falling apart... and there's no money for repairs. What's wrong with your brother? Just as we started making some money... he goes and spoils it. Where will we find another tenant? He's getting worse every day. Picking fights with everybody... Why can't he get a job? I've been after him to sell that plot of land... to that Athenian who wanted it. He told Katina yesterday he'll be going to Athens... to close the deal. But will he? If we could hang on to this house at least... You'll have a dowry... you could find a decent husband. My bones ache. I'll get ready for church. You too. I hear Mitso's off to Athens tomorrow. The Athenians are leaving too. Aristides told me. I must see you. I'm leaving tomorrow. Not tomorrow! Got a light? Is it true you're leaving us? No, it's not. I'm staying. Staying to do what? Tell me! - I don't know, but... - But what? I can't leave. I refuse to stay and watch you fall flat on your face. There's a limit to everything, even friendship. That's right. Can't you see no good can come of it? And can't you see I love her? - Like Dora, Liana and the rest? - This time it's different! You mean more difficult. Your back's up and she'll be the one to pay. Stop tearing my feelings to shreds! I may have been stupid... and irresponsible at times... But I'm not a bastard. If you were, I wouldn't talk to you this way. But staying on isn't being brave... it's madness. If you were in love with her, what would you do? That's a pointless question. You beat me to it, as usual. Yes, but if... I'd probably marry her. I've thought of that. And you rejected it, of course. I know that... it's difficult, at first sight. At first, second and last... it's impossible. At the risk of ruining our friendship... shall I tell you why? First, because you live in totally different worlds. Secondly, you're financially dependent. - You mean kept by my mother. - That's right. A socially ambitious, domineering lady! She adores you and you her and she'll never say yes. - What if I get a job? - A monthly salary... A two-room apartment and romantic walks in the park... If you really mean it, I can guarantee you a job. So call your mother and tell her. Simple, isn't it? Hello! Is that you, mother? Yes, fine. Antoni's leaving today. I'm staying a little longer. I've got to stay on because... because... What did you say? I can hardly hear you. I called to tell you that... that... I'll tell you when I see you. No, nothing important. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Love to everyone. Goodbye. Ready? Ready. Let's go. I'll take tomorrow's boat. Don't worry. I won't do anything rash. I just remembered something... a promise about a walk. I'd like to keep it. You're sure? Yes. Very well then. Take care. I thought you'd gone. Not till tomorrow. So we can take that walk. We'll meet at the chapel. I'll row to the cove and climb up. I'll set out early. - No one will suspect. - I'm afraid. Tell her to go away! Yannoula! What are you doing there? Go away! Go! Come, we're going down to the beach. Come on, sweetheart. - I must go. - What time will we meet? Five o'clock. Where d'you want to go? - To Kaminia. - I'll get you a boat. I'll pop over to the hotel and be right back. The Athenian wants a boat to go to Kaminia. Mine's taken. Take Christo's. I was going to submerge it. It's warped. - He's a good swimmer, right? - Sure. Get ready for a laugh, guys. - You'll pull out the cork? - That's right. He's caused enough trouble. Why didn't he go with his friend? Nothing will happen to him. By the time he reaches Kanoni... the boat will be full of water and he'll jump. Big deal. When you see him coming you remove the cork. We'll be at Kanoni watching out for him. Let's go! I want no part of this. I'm busy. Suit yourself, you old sissy! Mr. Pavlo! Take us to Kaminia with you! OK. We'll go for a little ride round the bay. Be careful. Good. Sit down all of you. That's right. We shan't be long. Just a short ride and back. No sign of him. I don't understand. Where can he've gone? The boat must be full of water by now. Come on! All together, children. Don't be scared! Jump! Help! Help! Jump! Soula! Jump! Jump! Run! Our children are drowning! Help! The children... Where's my sister? Soula! The children... Save the children... The children! Murderer! Murderer! My niece was in the boat... Soula... Where are you? I told you to stay close! Where were you? I was worried. The police are with him. They say he'll be tried for negligence. - Whose boat was it? - Christo's. Where are you going? I want to speak to Christo. One of the others will do. I thought I was dealing with men. What happened? - I don't know. - Boats don't sink like that. - What happened? - Nothing. A man may go to prison. What happened? When you rented him the boat did you know... - he'd take the children? - No! Soula was with them. You didn't know... so you pulled out the cork. - No! - Yes! - No! - Swear it! On Soula's soul! You did do it... so you could laugh... as you've been laughing for years... at my mother, at Mitso, at me... at Niki... Now it's backfired on you and you're running scared. But if you don't speak up, I will. I'll go down to the port. I'll shout so everyone will hear. You destroyed lives for a laugh... but I won't let you destroy his. You love him or you wouldn't do this. Yes, I love him! And I don't care who knows! I love him and I want him to leave with an easy mind. And you? I'll stay. And I'll walk the streets... without fear... without shame... There's no shame in love. Shame is lying and being afraid. The police are at the hotel. We'll go together... and you'll tell them. Because if you don't, I will. Where are you going? - Upstairs. - No, Marina. What will people say? Good evening. I had to see you. They've taken him for questioning. I know how you feel but it's not your fault. I want to help you but I don't know how. Pavlo! Look at me! I swear it's not your fault. You mustn't suffer like this. Please! The children... I keep seeing them. Listen to me. There's a yacht leaving for Poros... - Take it and go on from there. - No. - Why not? - I can't leave now. - You must. - What does it matter? Staying will only make it worse for us both... I can't bear to see you suffer. Why did I take them with me? Oh God. You didn't know. If one of us is to blame... - it's me. - No! I got you involved with these people without meaning to... - because I was afraid of them. - You're very sweet. - Promise me you'll go. - No, not tonight. Tomorrow then. For my sake... please. If you love me... And you? How can I leave you? I told you. I don't mind now. I'm strong. You made me. I'll be back. I'll write and I'll be back. Once you're in Athens... if you still want to... I'll be back. I need you. Tell me you still love me! I love you. Hello! Is that you, Antoni? About that job... can you arrange it?
