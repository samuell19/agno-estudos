Hannah: Love might be beautiful. But it's a vicious sort of beauty. Vicious because it forces you to act. Possesses you. [Wind blowing. Seagulls calling.] What is the perfect love? What is love? Counsellor: Owen? Owen? Owen? Yeah. It's your turn. Sorry. Um. Sorry. What were we talking about? John: Your rock bottom, man. Get with the program. Take it easy. I was drunk. Surprise. And I was at this fry truck. And this idiot was showing off for a girl. He was mocking some poor Asian kid who was working the fry truck. I worked in a fry truck one summer. Fuckin' sucked. Counsellor: Yup. I'll bet it did, Mindy, but - This is Owen's time. We'll get to you. Go ahead, Owen. So, uh - He was going on. And I grabbed a ketchup bottle. And I friggin' doused him from head to foot. He and his two buddies jumped me and hauled me back into the alley. And just beat the living crap right out of me. I mean, they were leaving me for dead. Cops show up. They wouldn't even touch me. Because I was such a bloody mess. I mean, I'm just lying there. And- John: What then, man? Mindy: In the alley. Um... Yeah, so anyway, I'm bleeding to death, basically. I'm gonna die. All of a sudden, this priest comes by. Don't ask me what he's doing out on a Friday night. But there he is. And he gets down on his knees. And he starts performing Last Rights. I gotta tell you-The freakiest thing that's ever happened to me- Ever happened to me is when I looked up at that guy. I looked into his eyes. And I could tell he meant it. He knew I was gonna die. I didn't care. Fuck. That's a good rock bottom, man. Yeah. Counsellor: Thank you Owen. [Knock knock] Nice suit. Hey. Figured I'd let myself in. You're early. Yeah, flight was ahead of schedule. Right. So this place looks nice. Yeah, I guess rehab's a big business now. Yeah. How's the food? It's not bad. I saw you're writing again. Yeah, sort of. How long you here for? Just tonight. Gotta fly home tomorrow. Right. Symposium starts in two hours. Fun, man, fun. Not really. A bunch of doctors talking about advancements in laser surgery. Let me know if you need a designated driver. Yeah, right. What's up? There's something we need to discuss. Okay. Hannah and I- We think you should come stay with us for a while. Just 'till you get back on your feet. Really? I'm at the hospital day and night. Hannah could use the company. Kids would love to see you. The kids don't have any idea who I am. Sure they do. No they don't. Neither does Hannah. Yes she does. I haven't seen her since the wedding. Exactly. It's time you got to know them. Just think about it, okay? Yeah. How 'bout a tour? Show me what I'm spending all this money on? Sure. Not gonna drink it? Haven't touched this poison in years. Well, I'm not giving everything up at once. John: Hey man! That was fuckin' terrific. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. I had that for you in group but you ducked out. John, this is my brother Alex. Hey. Oh, the doctor. Yeah. Oh [laughing] Oh man. I've heard some crazy shit about you. Save that for group, John. Jesus. Sure. Right. Late Christmas present. Publisher's pissed that I'm not gonna be around to promote it. I hear it's getting rave reviews from the tenants at Southside Rehabilitation Centre. You know what? Actually, I was thinking I might go to Wabana. Dad's cabin? Yeah. That place is rotted to the ground by now. No. Aunt Lily was there last year. She says it's just like Dad left it. But that doesn't make any sense. I just need a quiet place to write that's all- You need a quiet place to write? You don't need quiet. You need structure. You need support. The last thing you need is to hole up in a dingy cabin. Look what it did to Dad. Dad got sick, Alex. We have a cottage. Cottage? Yeah. You have a cottage? Yeah. We have a cottage. Who has cottages? Doctors have cottages. Alight. Not little shit holes in the middle of nowhere. You can use it whenever you want. It's got lots of space. Lots of privacy. You just never give up, do you Alex? So, we got a deal? I don't know, man. Where is this cottage? Cottage country. About an hour from the city. I gotta whiz. I think better when I'm pissing. [Water running.] I hope you know what you're getting yourself into. What are you talking about? You look great. Yeah, today's a good day, Alex. Not every day is as good. It's just your brain detoxing. The kids made this for you. That must have taken some time. Yeah, Hannah helped them. Tell them I said thanks. Tell them yourself. You know I can't afford a flight. I'll take care of it. Here. Give that to Hannah. See you soon. Owen: It's hard to say where the rift began. Memories fade in and out like damaged frames of celluloid. I remember the last time we were a family. It was just before Dad bought the cabin. Before he got sick. Before Mom died. Before Alex blamed me for everything. Years flickering by. Suddenly I'm seventeen. We put Dad away. Alex leaves for university. Mom gets a job. The only one she can find. Answering the phone for a shelter for battered women. The maniac's name was Jim. Drunk. Hunting for his wife. Clawing at the door. Until Mom stops him. She screams at me to stay in the car. She's screaming still. Jim:[distant voice] Fuck you! Shut the fuck up! Owen: The stench of deep fried grease and whisky. The crack of his knuckles on my jaw. The taste of blood in the back of my throat. And then- It was over. What if I stayed in the car? Would Alex still blame me? Would Mom still be alive? The fact is, she's gone. And we're still here. Owen: [as a teen-screaming] Mom! Mom! Owen: Stay in the car, Owen. Stay in the car. ♪♪♪♪♪ [Acoustic guitar in a minor key] [Birds, crickets.] How long will Uncle Owen be here? I don't know, sweetie. Hannah: Lillian, are you smoking again? Lillian: Shit. [Car pulling up] Well, at least you travel light. Yup. Come on. Hi! Hi Lilly. Hi! Hi. Nice to see you. Better to see you. Kids. Girls. How was your flight? Hello. Hello. Nice to see you. It was great. Thank you. Oh good. So, are you hungry? Yeah, I'm starving. There's a salmon in the oven. It's maple glazed. It's all organic. Perfect. I'll go check on it, Hannah. Thank you. Girls do you want to come over and say hello to your Uncle Owen? Owen: Holy smokes! I don't even remember who's who, now. It's been such a long time. You are- I'm Lucia. Nice to meet you. Callie, right? High fives. How's it going, guys? Do you like puzzles, Uncle Owen? I love puzzles. Come with me. You got one? Yeah. Alright. Wanna go? Alright. Go on over there with them. I'll take his bags downstairs. Okay. I like mermaids too. Lucia: Can you help us? Owen: I'll put it this way - If we took this apart, and we had a race, I would beat you guys. Owen: Ah, thank you. Hannah: You're welcome. Owen: So how long has it been for you two, anyway? Alex: Twelve years? Ten, actually. Ten? Whoa. I'm surprised you could remember the ceremony at all. Tied the knot and tied one on. Alex: You were a little tipsy yourself that night, Owen. A little? Jeez. Why don't we look at the wedding album? Awww, we don't nee to torment old Uncle Owen, do we? Lillian: The kids are happy to see you. They told Hanna they're excited about having a new roommate. Is that right? They remind me of you two when you were kids. Your mother and father- They'd be proud of you two. Remember when you wrote Alex's high school valedictorian speech, Owen? You never told me that. Lillian: You always had your father's way with words. Writing was the only thing he could do better than me. Hannah: You know, I haven't been able to put your book down. It's, um...It's fantastic. Thanks Hannah. It means a lot. Alex: So how's the new one coming? It's coming. You know Hannah used to write when we were in university. Yeah, I've been meaning to get back to it, but... You know what you should do? You should start a journal. I haven't kept a journal since- Since high school. Well I haven't been sober since high school, So here's to new beginnings. [Laughter] Cheers. Cheers. Hannah: I think it's about that time. Lil, would you help me put the girls down? Mmm hmmm. Alex, would you start the dishwasher when you finish up? Yeah, I think I can manage that. Thanks for dinner. You're welcome. It was really good. I can really taste the organic in that maple glaze. [Laughter] I forgot to tell you. Sarcasm is Owen's favourite form of gratitude. Lillian: Play nice you two. So, you're all right? Yeah. Are you comfortable? Do you mean, do I have enough money? What do you mean, am I comfortable? No, I mean, here. In my house. Are you comfortable? Well- That's not the word I would use. But it's, you know, yeah. But it's better than being alone in Dad's cabin, right? No, I know that. I know. And thank you. I just didn't know that I had any other place to go. You know? Have you been visiting Dad? Or-? What for? Are you thinking about going up there? Wouldn't that be a trigger for you? Life is a trigger, man. So, what about Mom? What about her? I don't know. Did you ever think about taking your kids up to visit their grandmother's grave? Or- I gotta be at work early. I'll see you tomorrow night. If you need anything, just ask Hannah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. What? He's practically a stranger, Alex. He's my brother. And he knows this is temporary. It's a month or two, tops. Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say. You don't have to babysit him twenty-four seven. He's not a child, Hannah. He's gonna be in his room writing most of the time. Trust me. His room. It wasn't easy being in there. Well, what do you want me to do? Tell him to sleep on the couch? Owen doesn't know about the miscarriage. I'm sorry this is hard for you. But- We have to move on. Okay? What if he starts drinking again? He's not going to start drinking again. How do you know that? I just know. What about the girls? I mean, it's not like you could just come home if something happens. Look, I paid for his rehab. I got him out of debt. What do you want me to do? Just throw him to the wolves, now that he's clean and sober? Help me help my brother. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Hi. Sorry to bother you. It's not a bother. I figured I could surprise the girls with this in the morning, you know? Actually, there's a couple of pieces missing. What? Mm Hmm. Well, that figures. I guess there's pieces missing from every fairy tale, isn't there? Listen, that wedding album- Should we have a look at it, or what? Sure. Yeah. Okay. That's it? This is it. Yeah. This is the famous wedding album. You got this grand piano over here. And this is your wedding album? Well, it was a small wedding, remember? Really small, apparently. Yeah, very small. There you go. Oh my God. Look at that dress. It looks good. [Laughs] We spared no expense. There's no shame in a City Hall wedding. That's what our parents did. You're folks still in Florida, right? Florida? Yeah. You remembered. I'm a writer. I'm good with details. You did tie one one. At least my parents weren't there to see it. You know, I think that's why Alex won't look at this. My God, you're so stunning. Yeah. This is pretty good. It was a long time ago. Well. I should probably get to bed anyway. Yeah. Me too. That's for showing it to me, though. Yeah. Yeah. Good night. Sweet dreams. Okay. Good night. [Wind blowing] Interested in me truck, are ya? What? My truck. For sale sign caught your eye? Yeah. How far you going? Just around the island. Get some supplies. Maybe into town. She'll do for that. Stay off the highway, though. Okay. Hey, where are you staying? Dad's cabin. Who's Dad? Sorry, Roger Collins. Did you know him? I sure do. It's a shame what happened to him. Which son are you? Owen. Clyde. Well. Seems decent. Come on in the house. I'll grab you the key. Grab a seat now. We'll have a drop of rum to seal the deal. Oh no. Thank you. Might help ease the pain of that eye. Yeah, I don't drink. Well, the apple fell far from the tree when it comes to the drink. I don't remember Dad being a heavy drinker. Not heavy. Consistent. A cup of tea will warm you up. No, no. That's okay, Clyde. Don't- Here we go. So, what do you do, Owen? I'm a writer. Yeah? You got your father's brains, eh b'y? Hmmm. Yeah. That's good. You're lucky. I was shorted in that department. Well- It's too bad they couldn't cure you're old man, eh. There is no cure. Here we go. Thank you. Well, it's strange. How a man can just lose himself like that. I'm not going to be able to give you any money until I cash a cheque. Is that going to be okay, Clyde? The last bank closed down here two years ago. You can take her now. I trust you. You're Roger's blood. Thanks. Who's that? The wife. Cassie. She's dead ten years now. Cancer. Sorry to hear that. Well, Cassie and Roger- they both loved the literature. Of course that all stopped when Roger locked himself away over there. Poor Cassie was heartbroken. But that's it. He got to be a real recluse in the end. Yeah. Listen. Thank you very much for this. Now. Now. Here look- there's no rum in them, my son. Not a drop. Cassie's recipe. Okay. Thank you. Hannah: Owen is here. Sleeping in the spare room. What we call the spare room now. I cleaned it from top to bottom. Tried to scrub away the grief. Alex doesn't smell it. Why do I? Hannah: I started a journal. You did? That's great. It's a bit scary. Oh yeah. Yeah. But I like it. I do. I find that the thing that makes it less scary - is if you write it like nobody's ever gonna read it. Just let it spill out of you, you know? And also, I think it's important to write every day. It helps a lot. It's tough with the girls around. Oh yeah. Well I'm here if you ever need a break. You know that. You have your own work to do. Yeah, but everybody needs a break. How's your new book coming? A few snags. Alex was saying that the cottage was a good place, maybe to write? Perfect writer's retreat? How would he know? Ha ho! I guess it would be a good, you know, a good spot for some peace and quiet. Talk to me! Nurse: Code Blue. Critical. No pulse. No pulse. Uh, continue CPR. Continue bagging him. Let's get the monitor up. Epi. One milligram. Injecting one milligram epinephrine. We have a shockable rhythm. Prepare to shock. Clear. [Bang] Hit him again. Clear. [Bang] One more time. Clear. [Bang] Okay. Hold on. We have a pulse. Good work everybody. Children: Come on! Come on! Hannah: I'm coming! I'm coming! [Laughter] Okay! Okay! What's happening? Get in the submarine! This is not a submarine. Okay. Okay! Ow! Oh! Are you okay? Yeah. [Banging] Children: Mayday! Mayday! Get out of the submarine! It's sinking! Okay girls! That's enough. Children: Come on! Hannah: Alright ladies. Let's go for ice-cream. -Yeah! -And cookies! -Yeah! Does that sound good? -Yeah. What else? Hamburgers. Nurse: Still here? I thought your shift ended an hour ago. Listen, I'm heading up to my cottage this weekend. If anything changes with Stan - Mr. Smith - will you the staff know to call me immediately? He was one of my university professors. English Lit. -English Lit. You? Yeah, I know. My brother's a writer. I figured I'd take it and try to get into his head. Did it work? Not really. But listen, Stan here is not the friendliest guy in town. Just so you know. Hannah: [Reading] Alex is never home anymore. An when he is, he has an endless list of excuses. Too tired. Too hot. Too cold. To busy. I should not feel selfish for wanting to be adored. Yeah b'y. Wow. It's all right, eh? Not bad. [Laughter] So this is what you call a cottage, eh? Wow. It' beautiful. It'll do. Hannah: [Reading] Nothing feels better than wanting. To want something nine times out of ten feels better than having it. [Dripping water] [Drip, drip, drip] Stop it! Stop it! [Whispering] Own and Alex. Roger: [On tape] So what do you want to be? How about you, Owen? Owen [child's voice] I wanna be a hero. Roger: Yeah? What kind of hero? -Ah, someone who saves- Hannah: And then this goes like- Is it like this? Is this how- Yeah, that gotta go through the- [Laughter] Put it like so- Ah! That was exhausting. -It was exhausting. I got enough. You have enough. This should go up more, I think. This is gonna need - -How tall are your children? Giant. You wanna make it a comfy kinda thing, don't you? Looks pretty good. Yeah! Thank you so much. Merci Madame. Yay! Cheers! More please. Lucia: Some cream? Anyone else want cream? I would love some cream. I gotta go for one second. Okay? Okay. [Bang.] Ow! Ow. I just cut myself . It's okay. Will you please keep my roast beef warm? Lucia: Roast beef? That's what we're having, isn't it? Hello Stan. We're still waiting for test results. So, surgery may not be an option. I warned you this was gonna happen, Stan. The cigarettes, the booze. I told you that I don't care. Save the lecture. That is my job, remember? Alright. You take it easy. Try and get some rest. Owen: Ow. [Laughter] Ow. You're lucky that nail wasn't rusty. Mmmm. Mm hmm. God, that one must have hurt. Oh yeah. Yeah? -It was a long time ago. You got it when you were little? I got it when Mom died. I was trying to protect her. Alex told me about that. He did? Yeah. What did he say? It wan't your fault. You know that, right? I know how you feel. What do you mean? The guilt. Thinking you should have done something differently. We had a late term miscarriage. What? He would have been three years old in July. A little boy. Yeah. You're staying in his room, actually. Yeah, Alex doesn't like to talk about it much. So- That's the kind of thing you gotta talk about. You know what I mean? I think so. I do. You can talk to me. Thank you. Yeah. It's okay. Yeah. It's okay. Yeah. Owen: Hey. Good morning. Kettle's boiled. Good. Wow. Those look nice. Yeah, I picked them up after I dropped the kids off at school. It really brightens the place up. How's your arm? It's fine. Thanks for helping out last night. I appreciate it. Thanks for listening. No trouble. [Door opens] Hey. Alex: Hey. That's two doubles down. You're coffee's on. Thanks. Listen, do you think you'd be able to take me up to the cabin? Sorry, I mean cottage. Yeah, sure. When? Today would be good. Why? Why? My publisher's expecting that book in a couple of months. And I'm not ready. I'm way behind. I just need to- Yeah, sure. I can take you up. You wanna come? No. Alex. It's not a problem. I can get Lillian to take me. No, it's okay. I told you I'd take you up. You sure? Yeah. Okay. I'll go pack. Okay. Hi. Hi there. So, are you leaving for good? Um - No, not yet. I'll be back in a while. Well, the girls are gonna miss you. A month ago, the kids didn't know me. So- They'll be fine. I'll see you soon. Sure. Claire:[Distant sounding] What are you doing? Roger: We have to find the files! -Stop it! -We have to stop them! -Stop them? -They're going to kill us! -Roger! Nobody's trying - -Claire! What did you do with them? -Roger! -What did you do with them? -Roger! Put it down! -What did you do with them! No! Alex: What's up? You okay? Yeah. Come sit down. Relax. I've been thinking a lot about Mom and Dad since we got here. Why? How's the writing going? It's going. You know, Hannah's started a journal. Yeah, I know. I don't think it's a very good idea. Really. If she was going to be a writer, she's be a writer. I don't think people should fool themselves. Sometimes you gotta give things up. So have you told Cal English yet? I don't tell him much of anything these days. You gotta take some time off, man. That's impossible. It's not impossible. Does Hannah ever remind you of Mom? No. Every now and then- She puts her hand in front of her face when she tries to laugh? Never noticed. Remember Dad would make fun of Mom? Mm hmm. [Laughs] I have a hard time remembering him sometimes. We should go up and see him. No, I mean the way he was-before. Well, he was always a mystery. Some more than others. Well, maybe we could go up there together. Owen. This whole thing- Rehab, bringing you here. It's supposed to be about moving forward. I am moving forward. No you're not. Why? Because I wanna go see Dad? That means I'm not moving forward? Come on! No. Because you think it's all some great mystery. And it's not. Mmmmhhh! Cal: I do hope that that is not the last thing I see upon this earth. Is there anyone I can call? The fucking janitor, I suppose. You know what I mean, Stan. You know that there isn't. You need open heart surgery, Stan. This is serious. This is happening to me. Okay? Not to you. I'm just trying to help. When you first came to my class- What's the first thing that I would have said to you? I don't know. Take out your pencils? I would have said, that there are no 'ifs' in books. You have to deal with what is on the page. You sound like my brother. Let me guess. You don't get along. Not very well. What about your wife? And your children? What about them? Do they like you? Of course they do. Good. Then when it's your turn to lie here. Why, you are going to have plenty of people to phone. Aren't you? Hannah: Take your pen in here, like this. And you see these groove? You just trace, like so. And hold the stencil down. And in, and then fire away. Lucia: Cool. -Yeah, it is cool. You wanna try? -Yeah. -Good job. That's great. Alex: Where'd the kids get that thing? Owen bought it for them at a flea market. Huh. When is Uncle Owen coming back? I don't know. Alex: It's only been a week, honey. Maybe you should go check on him. He's fine. Well, it's the first time he's been alone- -since he got out of rehab. So- Honey. It's what he wanted. It was our plan for him from the beginning, remember? Mm hmmm. If you're so worried about him, then you can check on him. Me? Yeah. Yeah. You go check on him. I'll take care of the girls. What about work? I'll take care of it. Just you and the girls. You're always saying I should spend more time with them. Go up there. Check in on him. See what he's up to. Can we go too, Mommy? Please Mommy! What? You guys don't wanna spend time with your old man? Are you kidding me? Do you know how much pizza we can eat in two days. Hannah: [Reading] I just woke from the same dream again. I dream my heart is burning. But I can't bend my arms to put out the flames. Wide awake and I can still smell the burning. Owen says he wants to be away from everywhere. Whatever that means. I don't think he knows, even, what he means by that. And I think that's his problem. Yet he is forever with his back to what he is looking for. Running from it. Claire:[distant] Owen, stay in the car! [Sound of car pulling up.] Wait. Not upstairs. Wait. Not upstairs. Wait. Not upstairs. Wait. Not upstairs. Wait. Not upstairs. Wait. Not upstairs. Wait. Not upstairs. Wait. Not upstairs. I got an idea. Do you guys want me to read you a story? No. Um. What about a game? You guys wanna play a game? When is Mommy coming back? She'll be back soon, honey. I promise. I got an idea! What about a picture? You guys wanna draw a picture? Yeah? Hey Dad. Do you remember Cassie? Roger: [On tape] So kids. What do you wanna be when you grow up? Alex:[as a child] I wanna be rich. Roger: So what do you wanna be? How about you, Owen? Owen: I wanna be a hero. Yeah? What kind of hero? Uh, someone that saves people. I'll let you think it's that simple for now, kiddo. But you promise me one thing. Promise me you'll take me on an Alaskan cruise on my fiftieth birthday. We'll get away from everywhere. Mommy! Oh! I missed you! What are you guys doing up, huh? They were waiting up for you. Hi. Hey. Is Uncle Owen here? No sweetheart. Did he say when he's coming back? No. He didn't. How's he doing? He's good. He's getting a lot of work done. How are you guys? Good. We're good. Here's I'll take that for you. You know what? I have a wash to do, so- Let's get you guys tucked in, huh? Can we go visit Uncle Owen next time, Mommy? We will see, sweetheart. Alright. You think Owen's ready to leave? Leave the cottage? No. I mean, like, leave. For good. The next step for him is to start over on his own. He's stressed. I thought you said he was doing well. He is. But maybe you should just let hime finish his book. I think he'd finish it faster on his own. Without us distracting him. You're the one who said that he needed structure and people in his life. Yeah, we need to get back to being a family. Wow. One weekend with the kids. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means the only reason you're paying attention to the girls- -is because you're jealous of Owen. That is not true. The girls are happier with him around, Alex. And you know it. You should have stayed in the car. I'm going up close. What are you doing here? I wanna go see Dad. Guess what? Alex is here to see you. With Hannah. Say something. Hi Dad. It's been a long time, hey? I'm a doctor now. Just like I always said I would be. I have a beautiful wife. Two beautiful daughters. Big house. You know what? This is useless. I think he knows we're here. No he doesn't know we're here. Let's just go. Owen: Why'd you come here in the fist place, Alex? Because you wanted me to. You brought us here. It was a mistake. Maybe this whole thing was a mistake. Maybe you shoulda just gone to stay in Dad's cabin. It's too little too late. -And who's fault is that? -Who's fault? Fault? Fault? Alex. I read your assignment. I found it in the garbage- that day I came to visit you. And? Mom told you to stay in the car. Why didn't you listen to her? You were not there, Alex. You have no idea what I saw. If you had stayed in the car, she'd still be alive! Girls! Breakfast! The bus leaves in fifteen minutes! Since when do the girls take the bus? I'm the bus, Alex. It's a game. Listen, Lillian's gonna pick them up from school this afternoon. Me and the girls from university are having a little reunion. Huh? I told you about it, like, a week ago. Oh. Well, when will you be back? You're working all weekend, right? So what does it matter? Girls! Hannah: I feel reborn. Rebirth is surely a bigger deal than love. Falling in love is so easy. So natural, so romantic. Falling out of love is so painful. So hard, so sharp that it cuts into you with every breath. I felt trapped in my life before now. Fenced in by it. Caged. Denying myself something the world is offering. And I won't stop until I take it. I'd love to be free again. Just for a day. An hour. A moment. [Thunder.] What's wrong? I'm a mother. I can't be this kind of person. I can't. You and Alex need to make peace. You do. I'm not gonna go back there. You can't stay here forever. Just give us another night. Come on. You know I love you, right. You know I love you with all my heart. Don't say that. Can Alex say that? Do you believe that? I'm asking you a question. What do you think is going to happen here? You think we're gonna get married? You think I'm gonna divorce your brother and marry you? You think we'll have kids of our own? Grow up, Owen. Fuck you. Fuck you! Grow up. Okay. Let's grow up. Put on your clothes. Put on your clothes! Put on your big grown up clothes, right now. We'll get in the car. And we'll go back to the fuckin' grown up world! Come on! Get dressed. Get fuckin' dressed! Put on your grown up clothes! Come on! We're gonna go back to the grown up city! Come on. That's what you want. Let's go. Hannah: What's left to say? I married too young. No more first kisses. No more butterflies. Owen, you were a moment of weakness. You made me feel unique. Desirable. Beautiful. Worthwhile. I thought I could escape the emptiness. I was wrong. Oh no. Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Oh my God! Hannah! Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ? [Gasping] What happened? There was an accident. Where's your phone? Where's your phone, sweetheart? Owen? Where's your phone? Help! Help! Help! Stop! Nurse: Male. Conscious. Tibia fracture. Owen. What happened? She came to end it. Who? It was a mistake. Nurse: The woman next door is critical. Same crash. It's my fault. Don't blame her. Nurse: Now, doctor! We're calling a trauma code. I'll be right back. Don't blame her. Alex. Hemorrhagic shock. Page surgery. Vitals dropping. -Need two bags of saline. -Lines are in. -We need blood! Hannah. Hannah. Oh God. Hannah. Hannah no. [Crying] What the fuck is he doing here? Alex. Lillian: Alex! Stop it! Alex! Lucia: Stop! Girls! Girls! Lucia! Were you in that box? Sorry I left it out like that. The hospital sent it over. I haven't had the heart to bring it over to Alex yet. How is Alex? As far as Alex is concerned, he doesn't have a brother anymore. Wait. Take this. And get outta here. Start over. Two more over here! Come on, buddy, drink up. You're two behind me. [Laughing] What are you laughing at? I'm laughing at you. Hi. Hi. Emily. Owen. You live here, Owen? Morning. [Knock, knock] Emily? I'm coming in. So what happened to you the other night? You don't remember? That's why I'm asking you. You're cooped up in this cabin too long. You're losing it. I told you I was leaving. So why did you come back? You want me to leave? No, I want you to answer the question. Why did you come back? To the island. I'm asking you about the island. I came back to tie up some lose ends. Like you. Do you have family here? What? I lost my family. What happened? My son was my family. He died. How? I was careless. It was a car crash. What are you doing? Don't do that Emily. Put those down. Emily. Put those down. Emily! Emily! Put those down! ♪♪♪♪ [Foreboding music] ♪♪♪♪ [Foreboding music] Roger: [on tape] So Alex, why do you love your brother? Alex: Because we're always hanging out together. And if one of us gets hurt, we can help each other. Owen: Like when I fell off my bike. Roger: Yeah. Like when you fell off your bike. What about you, Owen? Jesus. Jesus. Lie down, sweetheart. You gotta rest. Where is Emily? What's wrong? Is she okay? Is she okay? Owen. There is no Emily. What do you mean? The doctors... Look, you're gonna stay here for a while. 'Til we get to the bottom of this, 'eh? I'm sick, aren't I? It's alright, sweetheart. Your father had no help. But you do. We're gonna take care of you. We'll take care of you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Go on. Thanks. Look who's here. Go on, girls. Go on. I missed you guys so much. Hannah: Love might be beautiful. But it's a vicious sort of beauty. Vicious because it forces you to act. Possesses you. The perfect life and the perfect love are two different things. What is the perfect love? What is love?
