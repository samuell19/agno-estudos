Dispatches for command! Stop. And stop! I said stop! You’re more stubborn than a mule, with all due respect. Hey there, grandfather! What are you selling? I could use a blonde. You don’t even have a second-hand one? No blonde. The speciality of the company is whiskey, friend. A beautiful company, the mule produces it and you peddle it. - Come on, let us taste. - Here you go! Alarm! They attacked the guardhouse! Come on! Outside!To the guardhouse! Quick! It worked. Away! To the prison! Vamos! But they're shooting here! - Double Whiskey, to you! - Ready! Free the prisoners! Vamos, chicas! Vamos! Come on! Out! Let's go! Come on! Vamos muchachos! Vamos! Vamos! Vamos! You too! Move it! Round them all up! Hey. No, hey! This is the signature of Gordon Wacht! That's enough for today! Away! - Where's Clay gone? - There he is, Gordon. Vamos, Clay! Don't waste time! I was looking for Double Whiskey. I wouldn't want to leave him here. I got no use for that drunk! I've got enough men now! Vamos! Vamos! Vamos! Ah, provident. Thank you. Hold it! Come on, climb on. Double Whiskey thanks you, friend. Hey, presto! $500. $1000. As you can see, I come from nowhere, like the rest of you. Before explaining why I freed you, I'll tell you how I started. My father had a beautiful gold watch. I liked it very much. He told me 'When I die, it'll be yours'. Five seconds later, it was mine! A bank in Nevada. A sheriff in New Mexico. This is in memory of a cattle merchant. He was very rich. But so attached to his money, that it took me two ounces of lead to detach it! Hey, if you do that, I'll spit out the whiskey I drank in the last two days. It wouldn't hurt you. Uncover your arms! It's the mark of the Exterminators. Our mark. A guarantee of absolute loyalty. For every member of the band of Exterminators... ... delivered dead or alive, $500. And for me... ... for me $25,000! Aim! Aim! Sometimes, I want to slit my own throat to cash these! With this mark, you cannot betray. In all states, the only refuge for a man... ... who has that thing on his arm are our rifles. And if he tries to betray... ... first they'd hang him and then ask what he had to say! You guys were in jail and I freed you. Yes, sir. Because ours is dangerous work... ... I always need new elements to fill the gaps. But where there is danger there is also profit! Ask my men if it’s not true! I offer you to become all my partners, instead of rotting in prison! I was inside for drunkenness. They were going to release me tomorrow. I don't want to be a bandit. Listen, listen... Adiós. As you can see, I'm not forcing anybody. But who is not with us is against us. So what, do you decide? Are you with me? - Everybody with me? - Not everybody! Hold it! What do you mean? I'll have to think about it. I don't like people who think. No, no, wait, wait a moment, Gordon. Don't rush. First of all, you must be grateful that he brought me back to you. And then, you should see how he handles a gun. This interests me. I saw him take out a soldier with a quickness... ... that the poor man, will still be open mouthed by the wonder. You could use a guy like him. - What's your name? - Like the land you plunder. Arizona. Arizona? And then what? Colt. Arizona Colt. A land and a gun. I'm okay with the name. Arizona Colt. You heard my proposition? You want to stay with us, or against us? And you heard my answer? - I have to think about it. - There's no time to... I always find a little time to think. I hate to decide quickly. I came all the way up here to find out who, and why... ... it was, went to so much triouble to free me. And now that I've found out, I thank you from my heart, Gordon Wacht. How do you know my name? There’s your portrait on sheriffs' doors from here all the way to Mexico. Then I’ll let you know my answer. Muy bien! - I got him! - That's markmanship! Bravo, Clay! Where are you going? Maybe some other time! Imbecile! What are you laughing at? Take heed, I can always cut through your gut! I try never to forget, Boss. Hurry up with the markings! We must leave here! It doesn't hurt much. Halt! Get off the horses! We’ll stop here two days. Ration the food and water. And I don't want raids. The first one who tries will deal with me. Nobody must suspect our presence in the area. I intend to do a visit to the bank of Blackstone Hill. It seems to be very well stocked. - It's not too risky? - But no, why. There are no soldiers. The people are peaceful. There are few who know how to use weapons. - More than us? - Yeah. But as of this season, they go to sell the cattle... ... so escort their herds. - You just have to know when they leave. - From here, we won’t know of course. You're right Clay. You'll find out. You’re going to Blackstone Hill with the stagecoach like any citizen. But if someone sees my mark? Vamos hombre! What do you want it to be? You kill him or they hang you. But that, imbecile! You want everyone to know that we're here! Gordon, look! Up there! There's someone who doesn't think like you. This isn't a very beaten path. Whoever it is, must know that we're here. He must have been following us. I'll bet my head it's that damn snoop. Arizona Colt. Maybe he’s thinking whether to accept your proposition or not. Clay! Take five men, the best! And kill him, understood? Kill him! Follow me! Arizona Colt. Don't fire until I shoot. A gun only has six shots. Come forward a bit. That's enough. Pity, it was almost new. I bought it only five or six years ago. If there's one thing I hate it's unnecessary vandalism. Even their clothes will need mending. But that's few cents stuff. Turn around a bit. Turn around, I said! Yes, this will do. You know, from up there I could not be sure I saved the best outfit. I'm glad I wasn't wrong. - Come on, get undressed. - What are you doing? Well, you don't want me to stay in my underwear. Come on, get undressed! Quick! What is it, you're embarrassed? Except for the stench of carrion, I didn't lose much in the change. Thank you so much. You can go now. Go back to Gordon. I understand that he's impatient to know if I accept his proposition. But I don't know yet, I have to think about it. Howdy. Good siesta, Boss. There's the drunk. Always at work? I have to disinfect my guts of all the dust I swallowed. A man on horseback! It's Clay! Alone? And the others? Clay is coming! Look at him! How beautiful he is! Take a good look at him! You know what? The pink suits him! - You were hot, Clay? - What a show! But haven't you a little modesty? Shameless! Guards, arrest him! What is it, your feet hurt? What a beautiful girlie! - What happened? - That damn wretch... ... he killed the others and took my stuff. He then said he has not yet decided, if he will stay with us. - That's enough. I've decided. - You'll stay in your underwear? - What are you doing? - I need an outfit, no? Everyone on horseback! 'N-O' it's no. Judging by appearances he decided not to accept your proposition. You will pay. We’ll beat the whole area... ... and then you, Clay, you will continue for Blackstone Hill with the stagecoach. You know what to do. Vamos! It's not long to the stagecoach for Blackstone Hill? Well, if it doesn't lose another wheel... ... if not attacked by bandits again... ... if no horse is crippled... ... should be here today or tomorrow. There are already several people in there waiting. Thank you. - Eight! - Damn, what luck! He's good. Here they are, mine. - Gentlemen. - Hello. Come on, your turn. Hey friend, you want to play a little game with us? Thank you, is not for me. I can't play. No matter, whether you can play, just have a few dollars to bet. - You could double what you got. - Or lose it. - Where you headed? - To Blackstone Hill. I'm going to deposit my nest egg in the bank. Congratulations, excellent idea and excellent bank. - What do you know? - I'm it's director. Good. And your bank is secure? Secure. Until it gets robbed. Hello, friend. You fell asleep? Come on, your turn. - What's the rush? - Seven! So long, before the stagecoach gets here... - I'd like to do it again, if you allow. - Go ahead. Precisely. Did you see? I made some retouches to your outfit. - What does it look like now? - Very stylish. Yours is good, too. Shame it's a bit long of sleeves. But maybe you asked for it this way. The stagecoach for Blackstone Hill is coming! Thank God, you didn't get skinned today. It's my turn, now. - Here's to you, Dolorès. - Thank you. If you don't kiss me, I won't let you pass. - Pay the toll. - My kisses are worth much more, my dear. - Good luck, and come back soon. - Thank you. Dolorès, how much I will miss you. - Take this to Mike. - Twenty cents in change. You want to know something? And when we get back we'll have a big party. It's on me! - Oh, here's our John. - Evening, Sheriff. Evening eveyone. - You made it, at last. Come. - Bravo, John. - Ma'am. - Hello. - Come on, don't be bashful, come get it. Come drink, have a glass with us. A whiskey for my friend, John. Thank you, Sheriff. So, boy. You decided, Jane or Dolorès? You’re always so generous. If I were twenty years younger. Both! John! You're here! - I'll fix you! You ugly son of a bitch! - Father! That's how you obey your father! No, don't hit me, Father! I wasn't doing anything bad! I only came here to say goodbye to these friends leaving with the cattle! In this den of Satan there are only lost friends! - Father! - Out! Good journey, boys. Straight home! One last glass, boys! - But Father, I’m a man now! - You'll watch women when I tell you! As I'll tell you and those I'll tell you! - Do you understand! Son of a bitch! - Father! I’ll put you out of your misery! Blackstone Hill! One-hour stop. But seeing that it's getting late, we'll sleep here and start again at dawn. Good way of thinking. Gentlemen. - Can I buy you a drink? - Why, certainly. The offer of a glass is an invitation to friendship. Don't joke, now, one word would be enough... I know, friend. And all for your boss' mania of branding you like oxen. Keep it down, they might hear us. Cheers, friends. Such elegance. - Drinks for two. - Two glasses. No, thank you. No whiskey. A glass of milk, for me. You got the wrong place, this is not a stable. - And who'd have guessed? - Do you want a beer? - Go for the beer. - A beer. So far you didn't sell me. If you're in need of money, I can give it to you. How much do you want to shut-up? It would be stupid on your part to pay for something you already have. It sounds strange, but I mind my own business. But then what are you going to do? I don't know. I have to think about it. - Well, what is it? - Three times. See. No. - You're playing cards, right? - A very astute observation. See. - Poker? - No, busting the snouts of hustlers. Full house. And now to bed. At dawn, you have to get on the move with the cattle. And try to be gone as little as possible. You know that without you Blackstone Hill is practically defenceless. - Good luck, boys. - Thank you. We'll make Death Valley and in about ten days we'll be back. Maybe even less. Good luck! Roaring trade! You’re so interested in those men? - Two doubles, Pedro. - Right away. I don't even know your name... ... yet I'm convinced that we'll soon be friends, you and me. Dolorès. Card? Served. Card? - Card? - Two. - Card? - Three. One for me. Ten dollars. - Twenty. - I'll see your twenty. Well, Mike? What bad luck, friend. But how do you play with four of a kind? This way! Well done, Mike! I warned him. That's enough, Mike. Sit down. It’s your turn to deal the cards. It was worth taking a punch in the face to enjoy such a view. They hit hard in these parts. Please be kind, walk me to a room. You're standing on your own. You don't need me. You don’t like me... ... or you make it a matter of money? I wouldn't know. I have to think about it. Friend, don't feel bad. That, is Jane. With her, there's nothing to be done. Dolorès, her sister, there she is. That one is much more easy going. She doesn't say no to anyone. I prefer the difficult dishes. Anyway, thank you for the information. I like strong men like you. You're from the band of Exterminators! Shut-up! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Hurry-up! We're leaving for City Hall. With the monthly correspondence for New Mexico! You'll be avenged, Dolorès. I swear. Forgive her, her sins, Lord... None of us will have any peace until we hang the murderer. There's no way that it was anyone of Blackstone Hill. - Come on. - So strong. Thank you, friends, for your solidarity. I don’t feel like playing today. I can't concentrate. I still have in front of my eyes that poor Dolorès. Excuse me, friends. I can take his place? Look stranger, it's serious here, with no-limit on bets. I'll tell you in advance. If you can't play, we'll pelt you like a blackbird. That’s all I got. You can't beat me more than that. All right. - Pass. - Pass. - Pass. - Pass. I'll open. Five dollars. - Card? - One. Three to me. - Card? - One. - Card? - Served. Two for me. Word to served. - Word to served. - Word to served. Word. A dollar. Ten dollars. - Fifty dollars. - Out. No. Up to a hundred. Out. My change. - Well, what are you doing? - I have to think about it. See. Flush. It's not enough. - Four aces. - Four aces? Yeah, if you’re sorry to lose your money, don't play and put them in the bank. It's all quiet. Here you go. Keep. ... our books speak clearly. Take a look for yourself. Good morning, gentlemen. I've seen you, somewhere. You're Gordon Wacht. What you want? Just a bit of money, hombre. Murderer! No! And now be good, because today I really don't want to shoot. To the wall! You know a gunshot costs almost half-a-dollar? I don't want to lose out. You were a sacristan as a child? Face the wall! Let's get down to it. Get the money out! Open the safe, vamos! Gentlemen, remember that being heroes only serves to drop dead before your time. Not bad, hombre! Come on, under with the bags! - A dollar. - Here it is. Pot. For not knowing how to play, you don't take half bad. - Three times. - No. See. - Three kings, enough? - Of course that's enough. The stranger has only three women. How, three women? The stranger doesn’t have three women. The stranger has three aces. In my life, I've never seen an imbecile luckier than you. Confidence for confidence... ... I've never had the luck of fleecing more of an imbecile than you. I wouldn't recommend. I could be a surprise in this field too. Cheaters can also kill! Scoundrel! Look! Do not concern yourself, think of the money. High noon! - What's going on? - They shoot everywhere. To the north, to the south, to the east and to the west. We better skedaddle right now, otherwise our money... - Our money? - Ours, just saying. - You're done, you two? - Done. Out, then. And this is for the reimbursement of expenses. I'll wager that from today the head of Gordon Wacht... ... will rise to $50,000. Don't be afraid. I want to kill only one of you, not everyone. The tallest. And now you’re also the longest. Hold it! - Vamos! - Yes, Boss. When I see a star, the gun shoots by itself. Here's the horses, vamos! Quick, everyone on horseback! Vamos, muchachos! Vamos! Vamos! Vamos! Father! I missed, but it was him, I'm sure. He was the man who killed Dolorès. Come on, Pedro. Try to calm down now. The man who killed Dolorès. I mean, you recognized your daughter’s killer? Yes. He's one of the Exterminators. He arrived with you, on the stagecoach. He's a friend of yours. Yes, he arrived along with me, but he’s not my friend. How much you give if I go get him for you? You mean you'd go alone to find one of the Exterminators? That's right. Removing these chestnuts from the fire is my job. - How much will you give me? - Don't trust him, Father. He's a cheater. But shoots like the Archangel Michael. - How much you give me? - I'm not rich. - I can give you $500. - $5000. A murderer is not worth that much. What you ask for is the price of your fear! You've guessed it. The more I'm afraid the higher the price. Take it or leave it. I can't give you what I don't have. Well, maybe with a collection in the town... We may gather? Twenty dollars. Thirty, with a bit of luck. On Sunday, in church, nobody gives more than two cents. All right, $500. And your daughter, Jane. You want to marry her? - For one night. - For one night! You enjoy offending poor people? Well, I understand that $4500 for a woman... ... may seem excessive but I did it to meet your needs. Bring me that murderer. Dead or alive it's all the same. - I swore to avenge my sister. - I have your word regarding compensation? - Jane! You will do no such thing! - Yes, rather, I will. You have my word. Here’s the case where a word of a woman is worth more than that of a man. If you'll excuse me. I never heard a more odious blackmail! I've never seen a bastard more bastard than you! That Heaven... ... protect you, son. When I have a bunch of dollars in my pocket... ... I'll even do the C from the chest! Remember that there is only this source, before Blackstone Hill. Come on! Last one there stays without water! Hey! Cheers, boys! No? Why stop drinking? Be my guest, at your lesuire. Take a look around. See? You are surrounded. It's what you say, no? I hope you've understood that it's not the time to play tricks. So, the cattle sold well? This year prices got up pretty high, right? You rat! That'll teach you! Get in line and step forward. What is it, you don't understand? One behind the other, I said! Surrender your weapons. Vamos! Vamos! Double Whiskey, stop drinking! There's work for you! You've got a special nose for dollars, sniff out these gentlemen. Coming, Boss. Here. What a nose! Finished? Get on your horses little children, that's enough. What's that, you are amazed? You're free. You've been good and for reward I'll let you free. Go ahead. Go. Vamos! Vamos! Arizona, don't you move! Drop the gun! I missed Gordon's shooting gallery show, but now I don’t regret it anymore. I could have already taken you out for a few minutes. But I like that you know, that I’m the one who will kill you. Calm, friend. I came to talk with Gordon. - I have a good deal to offer you. - What? You don't want to decide in place of Gordon. You know what would happen to you afterwards. All right Arizona, Gordon will decide. He’s right in the mood to have fun. Maybe he'll invent something special for you. Walk straight with your hands up. And don't make a move, otherwise... Otherwise I'll put a bullet in your back. Exactly. Here's the thinker! There is no denying... ... for some time now it's looking good for me. Arizona Colt. He told me he wants to talk to you. Well, and we'll listen to you. Right, little children? We'll hear, even if you're the biggest pain in the ass in the West. Go ahead, Arizona. What is it, you lost your tongue? I came to offer you a deal... ... when this big goat jumped me. - I'll... - Hold it! - At Blackstone Hill they offered me $500. - For what? For the head of the stupidest man of your band. So what? Then I said, Gordon is a businessman. I'll go to him and propose the exchange. - Dollars against head. - I'm not selling my men. But this is an opportunity. A tidy sum of cash and you get rid of a fool. - And who is it? - Him. Tell me if he’s not a fool. He could have killed me over there and instead escorting me this far... ... so that I can ask you his head. Hey, I'm telling you! Are you crazy? Imbecille! I'm starting to believe that pain in the ass might be right. Clay, you're a fool! That's right, Arizona. You can have a deal. Gordon, I know you like to have fun, but let me take Clay's head on my own. Let me kill him! Otherwise, he’ll come take your head, sooner or later. Did you hear, little children? He wants my head. And when are you going to take it? When I find someone rich enough that can pay whatever it's worth. Back, you! And now we'll see what our Clay can do... ... to save his own skin. Well, Arizona. You want Clay, and you've taken him. Now it's right that you have the time... ... to enjoy your victory. No, the vultures will do the rest. Don’t think too much about it. Vamos! Vamos! Come on, at a gallop! Move, drunk! My whiskey did the trick. Beat it! You’re almost uglier than Gordon. He messed you up good? Water. You must be really grave to ask me for that swill. Am I the kind who carries water below? I got something much, much better. Here. This resurrects the dead and heals wounds. You need a doctor, Arizona. Stay strong and we'll see if I can put you on horseback. Take Clay, first. What harm have the vultures done to you? A rat like him always likes it. First Clay, please. When you ask me something with such kindness, I can't say no. Strength and courage. A good walk awaits us. He got him! He got him! Arizona killed the murderer of Dolorès! He's dead? Don't get your hopes up. I'm not dying before I collect. Yes. That's him. I'd rather hang him with my own hands. Bring this man into my house. Doctor, please. What have they done to him. How can a man sell his life for $500? - And for something else. - John! Take it easy. Easy. - Where did you find? - In Death Valley. Both seemed doomed but only the other one was actually dead. He promised me a reward if I brought him and that guy here to Blackstone Hill. You'll have it, friend. I've seen your face before, somewhere? No, I'm sorry. It's impossible. I've never been in these parts. Will be someone who looks like me. You’re not the first that tells me. Put him in the first room upstairs. - Were there any signs of struggle around? - Other corpses? My son, had to pass Death Valley too, returning from the sale of the herds. - You know anything? - No, nothing. Come. The doctor will take care now. - Tell us everything. - You have to tell us too how did it go. - Tell. - Yes, tell. One moment, the dust of the desert has clogged my pipes. I need to find the system to unclog it. - Hey, a drink. - Go ahead, unclog your pipes. Shame on you! When one is as small as you, should not enter a saloon! - What do you want? - A double whiskey, what a question. No, I said double. Double cheers! - These are the $500. - Put them there. - I kept my word. - Me too. But for that stupid matter with Jane... ... you can't really expect that my daughter... I'll answer you now. - I demand. - Then... Father! Please, there's still time to talk about it. You were hoping I’d lose my hide? No, I was hoping you’d understand, that you would give up, but I was wrong. It's human to be wrong. They were the best guns in town, but when you fall into an ambush... But then what did that drunk tell us? - Eh? - I'm here. What is it, Double Whiskey? If you're sitting in an armchair, you can also sit on a back of a horse. - We must leave here! - But why? The people are hospitable. They suspect me! They look at me in a manner... ... mamma mia. It seems to me that this sleeve, it becomes transparent. I don't want them putting a rope around my neck for the crimes of Gordon. It's not possible they suspect, you saved my life. - They do! Let's scram!! - Hey, calm. But you don't understand? Gordon and his men are searching for sure. And if they don't hang me, these, they'll take care of my hide. The Mexican border is close, we could get there with five or six stops. The whiskey's got to your brain. But do you really think Gordon is wasting his time looking for you? In my opinion, he didn’t even notice that you've gone. Yes, as for this, don't worry. I know what I'm saying. He noticed, and how! - But the doctor said he didn't... - My legs decided for themselves. They want to stretch. Well, I'm going. I see you're busy. If you still want to stretch, I bought you a horse and a gun. He really wants us to leave. And maybe he’s right. We stopped here too many days. And our trades don't grant unnecessary stopovers. What are these trades? Double Whiskey, he's a gold digger... ... I seek heads. When I see a band, I will follow... ... wait for them to make the hit, and then I introduce myself to the victims. I'm an avenger for a fee. - For $500? - Not just for $500. Now that your avenger has recovered his strength... ... he will demand the balance of the reward! - I was the creditor! - It's a piece of crap! And we are not men, if we allow such a thing! It's true, Jane is one of our women, promise or no promise. - And you would allow... - I haven’t promised anything yet. But if Jane gave her word, you allowed it. - Our honour is at stake, Pedro. - You got to do something. You have to stop it. What is it? You don’t like me? Would it matter? That's for me to decide. I gave you the money and we've treated you. Don't ask for more. So many of you have come to do wrong to a man who can't defend himself. We mean you no wrong. But I cannot allow Jane... I understood. But let me tell you something... ... sooner or later, I’ll take what’s mine. Remember that. - Wait! - No, Jane! Stay where you are! That man has got to go! - He's gone. - But he'll be back. Men like that you must never hurt. Either you stay friends or you kill yourself! May Heaven forgive me. Look, Arizona, that's the wrong way. Where are we going? That one will be fine. - For what? - To think. Thinking gives you a headache and that's it! But I know why you want to stay here. For that woman, for Jane. In Mexico there's hundreds of them way better than her. You don’t answer? You don’t talk. But you think this is a place to hide? In Mexico, yes there are some suitable places... ... of adandoned churches, but abandoned for good. - For me, this is fine. - Also fine for our funerals. Don't be afraid. No one can know where we are. Don't you worry. Wait. Gimme. Well, look... Look. No. No. It's not... Centre! That's enough! To refresh the memories sufficently! Most reverend citizens, to you who are the cream of Blackstone Hill... ... my good morning. I hope you don’t bear a grudge against me Put your hands up! But why are you trembling? I don't want to hurt anyone. I’m looking for someone you know too. A guy with a big gut. A drunk that everyone calls Double Whiskey. I know for sure he's here. Where is he? Did you hear! I asked where he is! Talk! He's not here anymore, Gordon. He left with Arizona Colt. Arizona Colt! He's got seven lives, that bastard! But this time I got him! Look upstairs! Search everywhere! Vamos! It's impossible, looking how I'd messed him up... ... that he left the only place where they could treat him. Any of you are hiding him at home. Don't make a fool of me! But no one is making a fool of you. They've gone. That way, another time... ... learn how to talk when you're not questioned. If you don't want to say where they are, worse for you! I will show no mercy for anyone! Those two comprades are holed up here somewhere. Get them out! Vamos! Enjoy yourselves! Have mercy for his sins. Forgive me. Make them talk! Make them talk! Where are they! Talk! Where's Double Whiskey! Where is he! They don't want to talk? Bring them here, I'll handle it! Come on, move it! Who's there? Talk, if you value your hide? - It's me, Jane. - Are you alone? Yes, of course. I need to talk to Arizona. The Exterminators have come back. They want to kill everyone! Enter. - Arizona... - Look who's here? Gordon wants to make a massacre... ... because he’s convinced that someone is hiding you. So what? I should turn myself in? No, but... ... you can't stay here without doing anything. I can't. You must help us. Help people that threw me out, taking advantage of these? It's true, you're right. But down there they will kill everyone. Women, children... Even if I wanted to, what could I do? I don't know, but help us, please. I agreed to help you once already. You promised. But you didn't keep. I’m here, if you want to. I'm not in the mood anymore now. No, Jane, that way doesn't solve anything. You know him better than me, tell him something. Try to convince him somehow. There's only one way, with him. That’s why Gordon’s running after you. At my time of life, one must think to old age. This is the money stolen from the bank and those seven of Death Valley. I'll give you half, if you come with me down to town. I have to think about it. And I almost fell in love with you! You're a coward! You’re smarter than me, my friend. Much more. Because now I'm going down and Gordon will kill me. Instead you wait for the storm to pass and then you take this mountain of dollars. And what is done is done, right? Congratulations, you’ve thought this through. For the last time, where are Arizona and Double Whiskey? Dead silence? And I will send you to the grave! You in the first row, three steps forward! You too, gentlemen. You want to do me the courtesy? You too, beardy! And you, grandfather! Yes, I’ll kill you five at a time, so you last longer! The fifth will be you. I'm talking to you! Vamos! Hey, Gordon! Excuse me, Gordon. I forgot the dollars... ... but I brought you a bit of my whiskey. You like it? You rat! Now you'll pay! Traitor! Come on out! Get down! Everybody down! Gordon! Gordon Wacht! I have heard rumours you'd came down to town and I came to find you. If you have a little bit of time, I want to talk to you. I have another proposition for you. Look at the coincidence. A little while ago, I asked for you and they swore to me you were gone. Pity, I said. I would have gladly had a little chat with that charming young man. Hey, friend. What did you do to your hands? You're all bandaged. And in the legs, too. You don’t seem very steady on your legs. It's all right, for when one dies he doesn't need. The dead are your specialty, Gordon Wacht. And when it's your hour, you'll find yourself at ease. - Well, do you want to hear my proposition? - If you don't mind, I'll talk first! Hold it! And now, if you allow Gordon, I'll do the talking. I had a score to settle with you. I thought it would be better to regulate it until I was of hand. I want to help you, Gordon. I'm up here at the top. Do you hear? Your hour has sounded, Gordon Wacht. Doesn't bother you, right, if I make a little bit of light? I don’t like shooting in the dark. You know, I didn’t do a good deal. The money you stole from the bank and the seven of Death Valley. We must give them back. Even if I take no pleasure in the thing. Arizona, if it’s a matter of money, I can give you as much as you want. You could use, think about it a moment. I've already thought about it! Double-lined zinc. Pity, right, Gordon? No, no, you can't do that! You can't kill me this way like a dog! No! No! No! Don't shoot, Arizona! I can't defend myself! I'll give you all what you want! Whatever you want! Don't shoot! You only owe me two holes in your legs. The rest I'll save with the citizens of Blackstone Hill. Don't shoot! No! No! Eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Indeed, hand for hand, leg for leg. Amen. Take him away. And, I recommend... ... a first class service. This bed will end up passing into history. How are you doing, Double Whiskey? To tell the truth, I'm feeling much better than before. A lady scorch mark, but pretty long... ... wide as the entire arm and deep to the bone. A wonder! It was the only way to erase forever the... ... yes, because it was so the arm with the thing... While you were at it, you could have downright amputated it. No! I need two hands for drinking. No. Cheers! Leaving? But there's still unfinished business between the two of us. For all my life, I will be in debt to you. Stop here. Forever. Forever? I have to think about it.
