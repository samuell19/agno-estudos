Hey, you sure Lisa's okay with me stealing you away for the night? Yeah, man. I'm not gonna miss my best friend's night at the governor's award dinner. Oh, that's fine, besides her and Mason are going out for a movie tonight anyways, from which I'm permanently banned. I don't know if you knew. Every time a superhero goes into space, I tell them precisely how that's not possible. [laughs] -You're a lot of fun. -Yeah. I guess it's a win-win, then. All right, man, I am almost done here. Let me get dressed, and we are out of here. [beeping] Hey, hold on a minute. LiDAR alert. NASA cross-check reference. LiDAR near moon. Further confirmation needed. What? Oh, man, debris field is 1,140,000 square miles. What is it, Rick? Rick? I need your Space Force engineering expertise. You have Space Force engineering expertise. That was 10 years ago. Hey, seriously, I just don't want to miss anything. Sure, let's see. Telescope's getting an odd signature. It's like a lunar eclipse or something. But we're not having an eclipse tonight. I know. Whatever it was, it was big enough to trigger Space Force's engineering protocol. Hmm. Rick, seriously, you're going to want to take a look at this, man. I've got a shadow moving across the front of the moon, and it's not Earth. I see it. Let me enhance the debris field on this. What's your maximal density? Density is two objects per meter, center of the field, radial configuration. No, that can't be. You wouldn't think so, but that density is too centralized for a random field. Pull up an isomorphic image from the telescope. I want to take a look at this. We have object's entering the Earth's atmosphere. -Whoa. -Holy shit. A cluster of fragments are heading for the Western seaboard. We need to alert the military. The impact has caused intense seismic activity. There's not a causality report or any damage report yet, is there? According to news wires and emergency communications, all structures within a six-mile radius have been heavily damaged. Six miles? It's the Chelyabinsk meteor all over again. I want a spectral scan of the debris cloud with an element profile. We need to know exactly what we're up against here. The outer edge of the debris field is 89% silicate. The debris field itself is just too dense to render anything in the center. We can adjust the depth of field in our telescope. Shorten the depth of field by 200,000 miles. -[pounding] -Jesus. Space Force Command is showing the outer edge of the debris field is entering the Earth's atmosphere. Do we have dimensions yet? I got them right here. N, E, O, 10 miles by 9 miles by 6.7 miles. Mass of 1.7 trillion kilograms. That's three times the mass of Mount Everest. Estimated time of impact? Six days, 14 hours, 39 minutes. Meteor shower density will increase by N units squared each 24-hour period. Rick. We're going to have a near-Earth object impact in seven days. I'll get an element profile. All right, send a threat matrix to the Pentagon. I'll call General Ferris. We need to initiate protocols. The Doomsday Meteor Protocol. What in God's name is going on, Captain Davis? I got a com-link here to initiate the Doomsday Meteor Protocol? Sir. I'm at Goddard Observatory with Dr. Rick Edwards. We need to initiate protocol right away, sir. We already have contact. Impact near Bakersfield, California, showing multiple casualties. I'm just getting word on the devastation, Captain. Look, I demand to know why there is a massive meteor that we are just finding out about now. This is the United States Space Force. We do not get a surprise hit from a massive meteor debris field. I know, General. Sir, it's just, normally we're well ahead of these things, but this one came at us from roughly the same direction as the sun. I mean, it got by all of us undetected. It's unlike anything we've ever seen in modern times. Sir, this object's roughly the size of a city. And the moment I knew its impending impact, I... General, I'm sorry. The casualties on this are going to be... Look, look, now, we will mourn our losses as we rebuild. Sir, I'm contacting Space Force's Captain Kenner and having him in touch to coordinate the protocol. We still have a couple more hours before the next round of meteors. Captain Davis, for the past two years, every bit of orbital engineering and infrastructure has been coordinated by you, isn't that correct? Yes, sir. Then as the official liaison to the Joint Chiefs of Space Force I'm officially appointing you the official advisor for this mission. Yes, sir. I'm going to send a reinforced transport van for you and the Doctor to Space Force command. -Yes, sir. -Out. [rumbling] We've got to get out of here. Upload to the Pentagon went through. Okay. Let's walk this through again. We're going to uplink all the telescopes to DOD, Doomsday. Then we're going to remove the firewalls from the real-time international database. And then we're going to initiate the global laser array, correct. Rick, I don't know, man. The Doomsday protocol is supposed to be the dead last option. I mean, do we really think that all these laser-capable countries are going to agree to fire simultaneously at the exact same time? We need another course of action first. Evan, Philadelphia has sustained major, major damage. And there are more strikes imminent. We only have a week for this. I know. I get that. But we can't get trigger happy, okay? We only get one shot at this. The oceans are going to boil and swallow up the smaller continents. Understand this. The air outside is going to turn into a hot gas. It is the annihilation of planet Earth. Before that, the debris field is going to penetrate the atmosphere like buckshot. I want you to understand that. We need to start with this global laser array as our first option, and we need to focus it on the largest meteor. We still need a contingency. I hear what you're saying, but we need all hands on deck. This thing's three times the size and mass of Mount Everest. -We have a week. -We've got to make it count. But trust me, I'll make sure our current protocol is priority. We're all better off with you leading this, you know that. Appreciate that, pal. [phone rings] Lisa. Hey, babe. Evan, where are you? They're sending us home from work. They said to pack up everything. I'm on my way to get briefed for a mission. There's a bit of a serious threat from Earth's orbit right now. Hey, have you heard from Mason or the school yet? Yeah, I'm picking him up in 15 minutes. All right, good. When you get him, I want you to get to the nearest secure military bunker ASAP. All right, there'll be emergency personnel there to tell you where to go. What? Evan, what is happening? Could be dealing with a catastrophic meteor. Is that what happened in Central California? It's just the beginning. Okay, we can expect to see several more small disasters just like that one until the big one hits. That's why I need you and Mason to get to safety now. Check your pocket. [chuckles] His lucky spaceman. Mason insisted that you have it today. [explosion] Evan, what's going on? Uh, nothing, honey. Look, I just need you and Mason to get to the bunker, okay? Get there quick. Get there safely. I love you both. -Evan! -I love you, Lisa. [phone disconnect tone] Evan? Evan! God. Damn. Understood, Madame President. Godspeed. Sir, China is prepping some kind of orbital drone fleet to send to the meteor and Russia has initiated their own independent protocol. No intel on that yet. Thank you, Staff Sergeant. Keep the updates coming about the Chinese and Russian ops. We can't have their separate tactics interfere with the overall. General Ferris. Captain Davis, Dr. Edwards, what in God's name happened to you? The meteor impacts are causing dust clouds all around the area. We got caught in one coming into the building. I just spoke with POTUS and she confirms that all capable countries have complied with the Doomsday Meteor protocol and will begin firing in two minutes. An NSAT list will be populated to the forces shared database when they are online and ready to fire. -Copy that, sir. -Yes, sir. Staff Sergeant, what's the progress? Sir, all laser capable countries are online. The NSAT list is fully populated. Thank you, Staff Sergeant. Initiate the Doomsday Meteor Protocol. Initiating Doomsday Meteor Protocol. [alarm blaring] All lasers are online and firing in two minutes and counting. Sir, you mentioned other countries are launching their own operations? That's correct, Captain. Sir, I'm concerned so many spacecraft and ordinances from other countries could start crashing into each other, taking us with them. Yeah, we're concerned as well, Captain, but it was like pulling teeth to get all the countries to agree to a doomsday strike. Everybody's going after that meteor as much as they can on their own. -There will be hazards. -Hazards? Sir, that could kill our men, you know, and take the rest of the earth down with it. I understand, Captain. I'll do the best that I can. You have my word. Sir. T minus 10, 9, -8, 7, 6... -Zones A and B. Doomsday 4. -5, 4... -Zones C and D, DEFCON 4. -3, 2, 1. -Doomsday protocol. All assets, go! [alarm blaring] Staff Sergeant, what is our asset loss? Zero. All lasers are online. Doctor, what's the real-time matrix of your model simulation? Sir, a meteor this size, which is roughly three times the mass of Mount Everest. If we knock it off its trajectory by 19 degrees, then there's a 98% chance it misses the earth. Good. We've got a full payload. Yes, sir. Sir, 31% of the laser array has hit the leading edge, clearing out 24% of the meteor debris cloud. We have a clear visual on the meteor. Sir, with a portion of the debris field cleared out, I can do a spectral analysis of this thing. It appears this meteor is 98% iron. Iron? The whole thing is iron? [alarm blaring] Sir, the strike didn't work. The iron content is too dense, the impact only affected the surface of this thing. Sir, firing lasers at this meteor is like firing bullets at a Kevlar vest. DEFCON control reports. Mission failure. Repeat. Mission failure. So the velocity of the NEO is unchecked at this point. The shockwave from the laser array has also accelerated some of the meteors in the debris field. So our first option has failed, and now the meteor shower is coming at us harder. Yes, sir. What's the ETA on the NEO strike? ETA is 6 days, 12 hours, 19 minutes, sir. [sighs] [gasps] Lady, you've got to get out of here. I am leaving. I have to pick up my son from school. We're under orders to evacuate. Let's go. My husband is with the Space Force! FEMA is trying to attend to the wounded across Central California, but are overwhelmed, sir. Casualties must be in the millions. Sir, by the end of the week, those numbers are going to balloon worldwide if we don't stop this thing. Now, general, the intensity and the frequency is unique with these showers. They're being affected by the gravitational pull of the meteor itself. They're going to become more intense, and they're going to last longer and longer and longer. This is not going to be easy for any of us. The Kremlin reports they insist on activating weapons satellites and attacking the threat themselves. Well, has the U.N. issued a response? The Joint Chiefs and U.N. think tank don't think that we have an adequate amount of time other than the laser array. So they've asked Russia to stand down. They are looking to NASA, Space Force, and the AMS for added intel. Well, gentlemen, what else you got? The intensity of these showers was... I mean, and I tried... Rick. Come on, we know what to do. We know what has to be done. Sir, we're going to need to go on a manned mission to the meteor. Fix some type of propulsion device to it and blast it off course. With your permission, of course, sir. All right, do it. Assemble a team. Sir, it's going to take me at least a couple hours to get a crew here. Have them here by 0800 tomorrow. No later. Now, if you'll excuse me. I've got to go talk to POTUS. Yes, sir. Okay. I'll start mapping a terrain of the meteor the way it is now after the failed strike. I'll confirm the area. We'll see if this is even possible. I mean, come on. -What about DART? -No, no, no. This thing's too heavy for an external DART explosion. It's not going to do anything. We have got to land on this meteor. It's the only way to 100% guarantee this is going to work. I'll lead the team. No, no, no. There's got to be somebody else. -Come on. -Who? Huh? The guys that you're probably thinking about are all on the ISS right now. We wouldn't have time to get to them and stop the meteor. And look, I'm already training for the next moon landing. And I know several others who are doing the same thing. Yeah, but It's going to take more than that. I mean, we're going to need a bomb tech. We're going to need more than one engineer. -We've got to be safe. -Okay. Look, Rick, I'll make some calls. How about you? I'm not going up there. I'm going to make sure your trajectory to and on the meteor stays on course. I'm not going to send you out in space without a backup. My God, Lisa'd kill me. Yes, she would. You introduced us. She'd totally blame you. Exactly, exactly. Speaking of which, I better call her first. -Good luck with that. -Yeah, thanks. Lisa, tell me you and Mason are on the way to the bunker right now. Good. Hey, listen, there's been a change of plans. Thank you for stepping up, officers. I know it must not have been an easy decision volunteering for this mission. If any of you think that this is going to be too much, that there's too much at risk, then drop out now. There'll be no shame or judgment on my part. I know most of you have families. It's our job, Captain Davis. Captain Mills, come to the side with me. Captain Williams, thank you for your service. It is an honor, Captain. You are a Space Force lead engineer, second only to me. I had a feeling you'd say that. It's true. -Turner. -Hey, Captain, It's been a while. Yes, it has, Turner. Yes, it has. Not since that Russian flyby? -Stiles. -Captain. I'm sure everybody here has heard of Captain Stiles. No doubt. She's a legend. Indeed. And she's covered nearly every covert bombing operation since Space Force's inception. Thanks for this incredible mission. We get to save humankind. Who's the kid? Hello. I am your navigator. I never get lost. Don't we have a navigation system in the shuttle for that? Yes, but our navigational consultant, Jacobs here, can execute two dozen calculations per minute in his head. 4D, accounting for time dilation. Like I said, I never get lost. Wow, what is he, like a little robot? He's like the rest of us. The best. Captain Mills here will be second in command. His first-hand experience performing complex installations in high-risk terrains on both the Moon and Mars. Are you all ready for this? -Yeah. -Good. I like succeeding on missions no one thinks I'll succeed on. Sure got one of those situations. Yes, we do. Now in one hour, we will brief the DOD on how to land on an unstable meteor and plant a propulsion device deep enough to ensure it's fixed. High enough that the thrust isn't obstructed by the meteor's features. Powerful enough to move it off course and stable enough to make sure the propulsion doesn't blow apart. But nothing has been built for exactly what we need yet. Command has a spent boaster rocket from private launch three years ago. All right, we need to find the nearest ground transport and make our way-- [explosion] Okay, we need to move now. You bloody heard him. Move, move, move! Dr. Edwards, I have the team and we are en route to command. ETA 15. Davis, prepare for full arrival. Ah! Is everyone all right? Everyone's out, intact. These meteors, they're keeping us pinned down. Being pinned down is not an option. We need to move. Ah! There's a military base just straight ahead that way. We can use that as cover until we find our way to a water run-off tunnel. Where's that going to get us? Most of the waterways around here come right down the mountain flow right past Space Force command. Move, move, move, move! Go, go, go, go, go! Sir, I still can't get a reading on the meteor strike team. What about the aerial reconnaissance team? Can they find them? They've been grounded by the meteor shower, sir. I also have updates on China. Their drones are headed to a launch pad in Beijing. General Farris. Yeah, Sergeant Crane. Yeah, again, we can't have too many assets competing for space up in orbit, okay? This has to be a coordinated effort. Now, I'll alert the Joint Chiefs to have China tell them exactly what they're doing. Yes, sir. Okay, let me talk to the doctor. Mm-hmm. For you. Go. Look, doctor, the Northern Hemisphere is being bombarded by meteors. We have an LZ on the NEOs yet? Well, unfortunately, the meteor is cooled in the void of space. The surface is no longer molten, so... Copy that. This area right here is only three times hotter than Death Valley, California. Do you think their spacesuits can withstand that? Oh, yes. Very easy to withstand. All things considered. You're a sight for sore eyes. [chuckles] Come here. Good to see you. About time. Where's your team? Pasting together our plan. All right. Where's General Ferris? In a private meeting with the president, trying to convince her that landing on a meteor hurling through space is the right call to make. Well, it's the only call. I agree with you. Now, where's your team's plan? I want to see it. I'll pitch it to Ferris after his meeting. Come with me. All right. Well, we are at five days, six hours, and 16 minutes. I need to know what the plan is. Mills here is our second engineer. He'll fill you in. Mills? Our engineering team has been ordered to cover the entirety of an oversized booster rocket to act a heat shield. Our Taurus 9 will fit inside that reinforced booster. Now, that will be exactly the propulsion we need to steer the meteor away from the Earth. Now, it is precisely that payload, the booster with the Taurus 9 inside a Space Force Shuttle... will be transporting to the meteor. As for deploying the rockets on the surface... Williams? Right. I'm Captain Laura Williams. I'm going to be the lead Space Force Captain. So, we're kind of in a situation where the residual heat from the laser rays is going to be a huge danger to our spaceship. Um... Basically, we're going to do a maneuver around the axis of rotation of the meteor, which is counterclockwise. And we're going to use the heat-resistant booster as a shield until we can safely lower down onto the surface. Okay. I have a landing zone for you. Just like Death Valley in California, only three times hotter. Very good. That won't be a problem. Well, actually, even a few yards down, it's going to be more than a thousand degrees. It's not going to bother the booster. It's going to bother us. We can travel inside of the booster on the way down. But didn't you say the top of the booster will be open so we can ignite the rocket? Yeah, that's unacceptable because the gas is turning to plasma as they hit that air convection manifestation. They're spinning around. It could kill all of us. But it needs to be open no matter what, Stiles. Otherwise, where is the propulsion going to go from the rocket? Give me that. Let me show you something. Can I? Yeah. Okay, this is your booster rocket. These are the gases that I was just talking about. They hit those convection currents. They're plasma. There's nobody left alive to push the button, Mills. We have to get moving before this rocket gets damaged. And if the Taurus 9 gets damaged, then we've got nothing. It's going to work. -Oh... -Rick. It will work. If we just get to the surface first and bore into the ground second, that's it. So we won't need to travel inside the booster on the way down to the meteor. If there's nobody inside to monitor their trigger mechanism, the booster is going to fail. Okay. Okay, so then how about instead of using the Taurus 9 rocket, we lower in several smaller rockets. That way, if one fails, we still have four other rockets propelling the meteor from Earth. So we'll be on the surface... triggering it from there instead of inside the booster below ground. That's right. And anything can happen to us, but as long as we light those rockets... Rick? I mean, five Halcyon rockets would be thinner. And 15% more powerful than Taurus rockets. It'll knock the meteor off course by 19 degrees, missing Earth by 1,200 miles, but we'll still be on the surface. Okay, it'll work. Now if we can just get back to the shuttle. And they will because there'll be a repelling line that'll have a retrieval cage on it waiting. We can get you back on board. And 500 miles away from the blast in 2.3 seconds. Okay, just to be clear, the entire team is going to the surface. Is that right? No. Turner and Williams are going to stay in the shuttle. The rest of us are going. There you have it, Rick. There's the plan. [whistles] Now, listen. This is the last chance. I know some of you have families and loved ones. If this is going to be too much for you, then now is the time to pull out. No one is forcing you to go on this mission. So if you need to leave, I understand. There'll be no judgment. But we need to know now. This is your chance, your last chance to change your mind. I mean, I'm in. And I already talked to my wife. She's pissed, but I need a holiday from that ball and chain. Suicide mission to save the world? I'm in. I suppose I'm in, too. Good. I was planning a pedicure for that day, but... Well, there you have it, Rick. Sound like a plan? Sure. Now, look, I know not everyone here is an astronaut, and you're probably not used to these missions being life or death. But we require everyone going up to record a farewell message, just in case. Thank you all. All right, let's walk through this one more time. We need to know this like the back of our hand if we want any chance of success. Mills, tell me that plan one more time. Gentlemen, the clock is ticking loudly. We're doing our best on current time constraints and conditions. If it takes them two hours to make sure those heat shields are perfectly in place, make sure they take it. Evan, you don't have time. Dr. Edwards, this is Private Crane in command. We're getting new reports that incoming meteors are going to be catastrophic if we don't move up the launch window. The magnetic field is shifting at a rate much faster than we anticipated due to the meteors continuing to enter the atmosphere. We can't have the booster ripped up once we get to the meteor. It's going to get ripped up on the launch pad if we don't launch. Mills? Honestly... I don't know. CRANE: There's another thing, sir. There's a pattern. It's building in waves. Yes, we know. A swell of meteors comes in as a group, then there's no meteors for a while. Then another swell comes in like a wave full of meteors that hit again. CRANE: But, sir, we've done the calculations, and we know where the meteors are going to hit next. They're going to hit right here. Command, we launch immediately. Crew, suit up, gear up, and get to the cockpit. Copy you, reporting to the cockpit. I need to seal the last few heat shielding tiles. The repair bot on board can direct a weld and fix small leaks once it's in orbit. Sir. Rick, I need to get a hold of Lisa. Please. I just, I need to tell her. Mason, goodbye. Just in case. Evan, we have your recorded farewell, okay? Don't worry, you're gonna see them again. You're gonna come back. You will. You're doing great, buddy. Now, come on. Godspeed. Ditto. Okay, good evening. This is Captain Williams. Rick, are you there? Where's General Ferris? He's briefing the White House, sir. We don't have time to wait for him. He's aware. We've dubbed the mission codename Hercules, sir. Go for command. Are we ready for launch? No. The end of this wave is about a minute off, and then you're gonna have a short period of time where there's no incoming. Everyone recorded their personal messages for family, right? -Did, indeed. -I sure did. My wife's pregnant. She'd kill me. Oh, congratulations. Now we have to make sure to get you home. All right. Ready for countdown. Countdown commencing, and T-minus 30 seconds. 29, 28... 27, 26... 25, 24... Jacobs, is that the coordinate set? -23. -90 degrees. -22. -Then we bank right at 250,000. -21. -2 degrees by 4 degrees. -20. -Mark at 15 miles. -19. -Mark 16 miles. -18. -Altitude. 17. 16. 15. 14. 13. 12. 11. -Secondary boosters. -Secondary boosters, are go. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Ignition. Lift off nominal. Primary system is nominal. -Throttle up. -Throttling up. Space Force, we have lift off on codename Hercules. Adjust oblique. 2 by 1. Why, is there more incoming? The larger debris cloud. The first quad expanded 14.2 miles as it stuck the atmosphere. And holding. We'll have to bank more sharply around it. With that trajectory, we're going to run out of fuel. But captain, if we go directly through the cloud, it'll destroy the ship. We've got to split the difference. Jacobs, there's no way to avoid the debris cloud entirely. Understood. Barring any larger incoming, 2 by 1 will be the final direction. [explosion] Ah! No! What was that? Ah, we've been hit. Coming out of the atmosphere. It's the starboard side. 4% damage. But it's to the cover on the inside flap. We can still maneuver. We're 5 degrees off of course, captain. We need to correct. Taking us back on course. Davis, give me the programming for the repair robot. Got it. [powering down] It's not working. The repair robot won't deploy. -It's gone. -What? The damage to the wing and to a portion of the booster took the robot with it. Dammit, you said it was fragile. Davis, we get to the meteor and we're going to have more heat resistance on port side. How bad is it? It's just one tile. That's all it's going to take to blow the whole bloody thing up. Rick, are you hearing this? Are they still going to be able to land? Listen, I sent you the location to the landing zone on that meteor. Now, Jacobs is really going to have to work at this. But he'll get you there. Yeah, I see it here, Rick. You have us landing at the terminus point of the meteor's y-axis. Rick, tell me something good. Well, it's not ideal. But with the right maneuvering, you'll be able to protect the rear side of that rocket booster. We can approach wide. Swing in along the z-axis. Projective trapezoidal approach. 33 degrees, same spot you intended, Rick. You heard the man. That's a negative, command. We'd have to slam on this portside thruster to steady the spacecraft, which could rip the boosters right off. Well, we could do two rotations first with limited bursts to slow us. He's right. The fixtures in the booster aren't graded for a dead stop, but they can handle a gradual stress. With that flight trajectory and two rotations, we're going to run out of fuel. Then we'll find a way to propel us back. -[beeping] -All right, incoming. Portside, 83 degrees. [crash] Captain, we are now off course by 15 degrees. That is a huge correction. Edwards, is there any way that we can land on this meteor now? We, according to my display, we're going to be about 100 miles off. Ma'am, we have multiple bogies crossing our flight path. It's a drone fleet. What? It's a Chinese drone fleet heading for the meteor. Bury the yoke! Bank left 45 degrees. [grunting] [gasping] Damage report. Hull damage to cargo bay. Overhead lighting to bay is fried. Damn it, Ferris is right. These other countries are practically climbing over each other to stop this meteor. Well, at least they're ahead of us. If they succeed in... If they succeed, I have zero complaints, more power to them. I don't care who gets there. Same, but I prefer they not kill us in the process. Well, Captain, unless we plot entirely different coordinates, we will not reach the meteor. I suggest coming straight in, then banking along the surface to complete a double circuit. Williams, this is Rick. Jacobs is right. Change course. There's another viable landing spot on the far side of the meteor. It's about four miles from the ideal propulsion site, though. If we activate the rocket four miles from the original landing zone, will we still be able to force the meteor away from Earth? Sir, there's been extensive damage to Melbourne, Australia. We don't have time for that right now, Staff Sergeant. I also have an update from the Pentagon on the Russian protocol. It's a massive conventional missile strike. They're set to go within hours. We've tried to get them to stop, but they're set on doing it. Okay, listen up, Captain Davis. You need to get to the correct launch site now. You can't be a mile off of the ideal propulsion site. The trajectory of the meteor is going to be all wrong if you do, and this will all be for nothing. Then once we land, we'll have to tow the five rockets four miles across the surface to the original landing zone using the rover. Okay, but here's your problem. You got the rockets. You got the protective shield. Together, it's a couple tons. It'll be all right. It's a military-grade rover, not like those old NASA ones. This thing's a tank. It's durable, but it's only been beta tested in these situations. The tread is cauterized steel and polymer alloy It'll be all right. I know. I'm just trying to stay ahead of things here. Whatever it takes, Captain, we'll get it done. Look, if you can get those rockets to the location, I can trigger those munitions. I can sink those suckers. Captain Williams, Captain Davis, our angle of descent will alter our ability to do a single-unit rotation. I suggest a yaw of 10 degrees starboard to allow all heat and debris to angle the ship and the rockets furthest away. Wait, isn't that the section with the missing tile? The friction is going to be like re-entry on Earth. There's not going to be nearly enough. Yeah, but there's still going to be, what, molten iron and explosions and debris all on the surface and above. Just a little plasmatized gas. Boom, shaka-laka. Well, that won't happen if we do the maneuver precisely. The heat-resistant tile is the size of a paper plate, right? That's all it takes. Once the gas gets in, boom, it's like a bomb. I know, I know, but it shouldn't take much to reinforce it. Turner, we don't have any more tiles. But we have a ton of metal on board, or at least enough steel and heat-resistant insulation from the cargo bay to make a small shield. Turner, one of us would actually have to go out there ourselves and weld it into place. That is correct, Captain. I need you to stay here and co-pilot, Captain Turner. I will, right after I weld the panel onto the rocket shield. I should be the one that goes. You're the engineer here. You'll need to make sure the rockets are in place. Everyone else here, we can't afford to lose. I'm going. If I don't, Earth dies. All right. You go out, weld, and get back in here. Yes, sir. Stiles, help me cut some insulation from inside the cargo bay. I'll take off the electrical panels and prep the welder. That'll be our heat shield. Copy that. Turner, seriously, you get out, you get right back in. I will. Thanks. Are you hearing this, Rick? There has to be another way. I don't have time for another way. Captain, what Turner's suggesting is suicide. Yeah, we know. But what other choice do we have? You know, that's bigger than a paper plate. Yeah, a little extra can hurt. Let me go with you. Two minutes. Shave time off the weld. -Come on. -Stiles... You know we can't lose both of us. Approaching the meteor, 19,000 miles and closing. Speed, Mach 10, retrograde thrusters are 4%. Thrusters, 4%. 3%. Thrusters, 3%. Turner's repairing the broken heat tile. Have her do it quickly. Yes, sir. Come on, Turner, we don't have much time. Initiating roll... 0.7 degrees per second west east. [alarm blares] Incoming, 12 degrees starboard! Apply point side retrograde, 0.7 roll and 12% pitch. Port side retro roll, pitching 12%. Williams, excessive heat warning. Turner! Turner, find a way to secure it and get in here. That is a order. Tilt aft, aft! Away from the heat! No, no, no, if we do that, we'll blow up. Get her in now, now! Turner, get inside! No can do, Captain. The shield is in place. Then weld it into place and get in there now! I'd love to, Captain, but the welding torch flew off on the last maneuver. She can't weld it into place. If she can't secure herself before we reach the meteor... I've got the shield pinned down. Once my suit breaks down from the heat, the polymers will liquefy and seal it in place. Finish the landing! Turner, you find a way to get inside! Do not stay out there! I'm coming hot, Captain! Roll 7%! Pitching 12 degrees! Turner? Come in, Turner. Turner, come in. Turner, we need you to respond. She's gone, Davis. I'll take co-pilot. It's fine. I'll take it. I can take co-pilot. I said I got it! It's fine. I just... I'm okay. I'll take it. Aye-aye, Captain. -[crash] -Ah! Mills! I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right. Jacobs? Uh... Entering our second revolution, sir. Apply, port side retrograde, one percent. One percent. Four hundred meters. Three hundred meters. Two hundred meters. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're encountering some turbulence from some gas jets. There's no way we can land upright to detach the rockets. Whoa, whoa, whoa, this ship was not designed to land on its side. with a full payload, Captain. I understand that Jenkins. But right now... We won't be able to land at all. If you can orient the craft to land on its side between the spacecraft and the boosters, the stress on each will be reduced by half. We cannot risk an ounce of stress on those explosives. Hundred meters. Roll twenty degrees and apply afterburners 100%! Twenty degrees. Brace! [crashing] [grunting] Damage report. How's the cargo? All five rockets are intact. Stiles? Three-tier explosives wired and ready. All right. Space Force command, this is Davis. We are on the meteor surface four miles from the original landing zone. Copy that, Captain. I thought we lost you there for a minute. According to the Chinese, there was a near collision between their drones and your spacecraft. That's correct, sir. They were in a hurry. Like you said, it's a horse race to kill this meteor. Let's hope one of our countries does it. Glad you're okay, Evan. Not all of us are, Rick. That's a negative. Mills took some body damage on impact and Turner... Well, she saved us all. But as far as the mission, we're still on course, sir. I don't have to tell you, Captain Davis, that if you don't finish this mission in five hours, then we're all... Total destruction. According to POTUS, they're doing everything they can, but I just think it's futile. Hold on. Just one moment here. I've been handed a report that apparently the Russians have launched a massive conventional strike. However, it was lost inside the meteor cloud. Copy, General. Davis, what's Mills' status? Uh, undeterminable at the moment. No obvious bleeding, but possibly internal. The ship took a lot of damage coming in. But thanks to Turner, your heat shield held up. Captain, we're gonna need you to start your mission. We need to get those rockets to the launch zone. Sir, we are nowhere near our original landing site. Factoring in a rotation, just setting up our payload. It would blast the meteor faster to Earth. -We'll get a move on. -Sir, our shuttle's shot. Davis, you're gonna have to move the load manually. Of course. We will be doing a spacewalk. With limited oxygen. And Mills? Mills is staying here. Fix the damage. In our current condition, we can't take off. The thrusters are completely fried. Not to mention the steering is completely damaged. Exactly. Oh, if we're getting up this rock, I need time to repair the ship. Jacobs, how we look? Well, mounting a detached spacewalk with limited oxygen and carrying more weight than our suit's weight tested. Not to mention stress, rotation. Well, I'd put us at three hours, 38 minutes. -Give or take. -Give or take? Well, I'm simply factoring in the amount of O2 left to complete the mission. If nothing goes wrong. Again. Okay. Then let's quit wasting time. Let's move out. Good luck out there, Evan. Luck's got nothing to do with it, Rick. Jacobs, you get an estimate of what our coordinates are? Well, we landed two full longitudinal coordinates over from the original LZ, but almost directly in line with it. There was an 11,400 square yard mountain we cleared before landing. So we're gonna go right, 18 degrees, go straight, 800 yards, and then bank hard left, 30 degrees. I love that you knew how to do that. Well, it's simple, really. I just calculated the coordinates from where we landed to where the original LZ was, plus my own topographical estimate based on my view from the spacecraft. When you say you never get lost, you never get lost. Is that the explosives we're using when we get there? Yeah. I didn't realize they were so small. Oh, looks can be deceiving. Those are the triple rail gun charges, right? They act on rock the way hollow point bullets do on human flesh. Oh, yeah. How descriptive. What we do is we prime the rock with the laser drills, and then we sink the charges, and we sit back and we watch the show. Music to my ears. I think before we leave, we should check our O2 levels. We're at 95%. Now, if we get delayed, we may have to dip into our reserve tanks, and once we do that, our odds of getting back to the ship go way down, okay? So we need to move. Copy that. How's our cargo look? Looks good. It's all still there. Great. Okay, we've got a pretty steep incline up ahead. Any chance I can go around? I don't know, sir. There wasn't enough time on Earth to do a full topography scan. Plus, we don't know what's up there. It could take some time to get around. Right. Okay, everyone hold on, then! [panting] Ah! Keep to the right, there's a huge drop off on the left. I'd rather not die today. It's too steep. I don't know if we'll make it over. Incoming, 38 degrees southwest, Melbourne, 18 bogeys. Incoming, 90 degrees northwest, Berlin, six bogeys. Sir, the Russian embassy just messaged they say that they fired stinger missiles with zero success rate. Norad said that there's too many to target. We can't just sit here and let Earth be reduced to rubble. This is a numbers game. And we need Space Force and all the defenses internationally to start firing those bogeys out of the sky. We can use the Patriot missiles. Yeah, and then we can launch every aircraft to have them up in the air to shoot down anything the Patriots don't get. You send our pilots up right now, they're going to be killed within seconds. We have to do something. And we load up all the aircraft, Space Force, Air Force, with as many heat-seeking missiles as possible, two, three times the capacity. If that doesn't explode, they're going to crash from the weight. They'll be fine, they can use a stepped wireless detonation even with the extra missiles. Dispatch, this is Space Force command. I need you to launch every Air Force and Space Force aircraft that we have and load them up with heat-seeking missiles two and three times the missile capacity. Scrabble them ASAP and as soon as they're at maximum velocity, start firing. Staff Sergeant, tell UN to do the same. Heat-seeking missile's, maximum capacity. Come on! Just a little further! Slow and easy! Watch that drop off! Made it! Captain, Captain, Captain. When you reach the bottom of this ridge, you will want to adjust left by one degree. Thank you, Jacobs! Sir, it's working. Our success rate right now is 74%. Doctor, what are our losses? Air Force is reporting 40% of their fleet is missing, 40%. London's airspace is now clear, sir. Berlin's airspace is clear. Bombay's airspace is clear. And Melbourne's space is clear, sir. St. Petersburg is also clear, sir. Looks like we're just down to small particles and issues. We've spared the major population areas. Thank you, Doctor. You stay vigilant. [phone ringing] Lisa. Thank God, I have been trying to reach you for hours. Is it true? Did Evan make it onto the meteor? Yes. [gasps] Okay, if you do reach him, tell him that we are safe in the bunker, and Mason's already asking when he's coming home. I will. He wanted to tell you himself, but the launch window got moved up, so he asked me to tell you, okay? I know. Thank you. Lisa, if you need anything... Well, at least we know what happened to the Chinese drones. Could have been the debris field. Look, these drones are all way too small to even have adequate shielding. I mean, look, they're scattered everywhere. Well, Jacobs, help me out here, buddy. I veered the one degree. What do we do now? Where do we go? Well, like I said, sir, we didn't have a very accurate map of the topography before coming here. It was just so we can glean from the short window between discovery and launch. Is there another way around it? Oh, there's no time to reroute. This could go on for miles. And besides, we'd probably be dead by the time we find another way. According to my calculations, it should be right over there. I worked it all out. [panting] So close. Yet so far. Stupid! I'm sorry, sir. That's all the information he gave me. I talked to Ferris, I talked to Rick, I talked to all of them. They didn't have anything for me. Stupid, stupid, stupid. -I'm... -Jacobs. Stupid. So stupid. Jacobs! Come here! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! -Would you look at me? -Sorry, sir. It's not your fault. Okay? It's not. We're all flying blind out here, okay? Okay? But I need you to calm down. Okay? I need you to relax your breathing. You're burning through the O2. We can't have that. Okay? I need you to calm down. All right? Plus, I need that brain of yours clear. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just... I just never... I... I've never... I just... I just want to make sure that we get to the site in time, but... but also make it back to the ship, and it's just so much pressure. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look right here, buddy. Stay with me. Let's just focus on getting to the site. All right? We'll worry about the ship later. Yes, sir. Okay. [missiles roaring] Look! Those are missiles! Those are the Russian missiles that were destroyed by the meteor cloud. No! Not destroyed! Lost! They must be targeting the meteor at different points to try to knock it off course. Go, go, go! There's a cave! There's a cave! [explosions] [panting] Are you okay? Are you okay? Lost my lights. I'm good. Stand up for me. Ah! Oh, God. Where are we? -[rumbling] -Oh! I can't see anything. Jacobs, we got to get out of here. It rains more and more down on us. It's gonna seal up every opening. We're gonna have to try to dig out way out a little bit. EVAN: Mills. Come in. Mills, copy? Davis! Davis! This is Mills! Davis, come in! Mill's here! Davis, do you copy? [scrambled radio] Davis! Do-- copy? Come in, Davis! Come in! [grunts] Okay, okay. [panting] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Davis, Davis, Davis! -[alarm blaring] -Come in, Davis! Davis! If you can hear me, we're leaking fuel! You need to move! Davis, come in, Davis! Look, I'll try to stop the leak, but I can't guarantee anything. Do what you need to do and get out of there quick! Come on, Davis! God damn! Ah! [panting] Davis! Come in, Davis! No signal. There's no signal. Every impact, it's filling us in with more debris. We've got to clear some of this in case Davis and Williams are on the other side. Try to get through. [grunts] Those are made of iron. They are so heavy. Be careful. Oh, jeez. [beeping] Stop, stop, stop. -What is that? -We're burning too much oxygen. Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right. The reserves are still in the rover, aren't they? Yeah. Oh, jeez. It's going to be impossible to dig out of here with our bare hands. We've got no explosives. We've got no equipment. Well, we're not too far from the target site. If they can get us out, I can get us there. We can't leave them in there. Stiles is the only one that understands the charges to blow up the meteor surface. We might not get home without Jacobs. Yeah. You know, I don't like it, but... I could fire one of the laser drills, create an opening straight ahead. Then if they're fast enough, they can make it out before the rest of the cave comes down. Okay, well, looking at it. With all this debris shifting, we'd have to get them out really fast. We'll have to ignite one of the rockets. Propel us away from the collapse. We're gonna burn precious fuel. But it'll work. So long as you fire the laser at the same time we ignite the rocket. I'll be on the side to haul them in. I really only want to hear one answer. It'll work! That's the spirit. Very good. Either they're trying to find a way inside to get us... Or they've moved on. No, no, no, no. I doubt that. I'm the navigator. We can't just sit here. Let's do what we can. Just try not to burn too much oxygen. We could burn up to a quarter pound of O2 with strenuous exercise. We'll shave off about five minutes or so from our oxygen supply, which won't be good. How do you know that stuff? Well, it's a simple calculation, really. You just factor in the human oxygen strength, levels, and... Okay, okay, thanks, thanks. Let's just keep trying to clear this space. That should give enough strength to the piers and abutments. Now, as long as we don't lose integrity from the rise or intrados, everything should be clearer. Theoretically. Theoretically? I guess that's better than nothing. Let's give it a shot. -Let's go. -You only get one shot at this. -Roger that. -Don't deviate a degree. Roger that. -Ready? -Ready. Firing in three, two, one. Ah! There's a space! We can get through! Go, go, go! Quick! Another missile's headed our way! Thanks for the lift, guys! [explosions] This rover can only take so much! We don't have a choice! We gotta stick with it as long as possible! Jacobs, how much further to the site? At a current rate of travel, we will miss our launch window by one hour. Check the engine, grease the gears, keep it moving, let's go! The rover sustained too much damage to try to handle this terrain, Captain! That's it, guys! We ate up too much time! I have to dip into the oxygen resource! Try to keep it nice and steady until I can come up with a plan B! Davis, this is Space Force Command. Come in, Davis. Space Force Command, this is Captain Mills Captain Davis and the team are traversing the surface now. We're relieved to hear that, Captain. What is their status? They've been trying to reach me, but I haven't been able to get a steady signal. USSF Command, now that I have you here, I need you to confirm the fuel line seals as I work. Tell me when you see steady numbers on your side. Roger that. Say, Mills, we've been trying to reach you. At the current rate, the meteor crew is only going to have about ten minutes once they get to the launch site. [grunts] Command. Reading? Fuel line's steady. We have pressure. Thank God. I'll reestablish contact with you as soon as I reach them. Davis, I'm picking up more missiles approaching our launch site location. It's going to be impossible to set up the detonators with those around. We can't keep going on like this. We'll only make it in time if we have a totally straight travel path. No side to side. No up and down. Davis, come in. Davis, it's Mills. This is Davis. Go. [chuckles] Davis, I just got off the line with Command. You have ten minutes to reach the launch site. Ten minutes. How far are you? Just a few hundred yards, Captain Mills. We're almost there. Godspeed, sir. Godspeed. You didn't tell him about the Russian missiles. He didn't need to know. More incoming! [explosions] Come up with that plan B? Yeah, this is it! Let's go! Agh! It's malfunctioning! -Agh! -Look out! Look out! Ah! Ah! -Davis! -Jacobs! Davis! Jacobs! Oh my God! I'm coming, buddy! Hold on! [whimpering] No, no, no... No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no. Jacobs. Hey, buddy. Looks like you just took a hard shot to the ribs. Nothing a chest brace can't fix. I knew what I was getting myself into. [sobs] Listen, buddy. You hang in there, okay? We're going to get you out of here. Okay? Give me your hand. Let's go. All right? We need to get you to the site and then back on the ship home. No! You're wasting time! Go! Come on! There's not enough time! You need to go! Go! Finish the mission! The GPS is broken, Captain. But you don't need me anymore. You can find your own way back. Just follow the tracks of the rover back to the ship. Just like following... a set of train tracks. Besides, my odds of survival are... are... zero. Jacobs, don't you give up on me! Come on, buddy! Jacobs, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry... Where's Jacobs? We're here! Let's just get it done! [explosion] The meteor must be crossing the debris path. We have to hurry! Unhook the rockets! Ah! No, no! We'll all be dead if we don't keep moving. The ignition system is totally destroyed. What? No! The missiles are dead, Captain. There's no way to launch them. They're useless slabs of metal without a firing system. [explosion] I'm going to unhook the booster. It's now or never! Okay, Davis, what is our next step? I don't know, I... That was our last option. What? The entire Earth. My family. No. No, Davis, there has to be another way! There has to be another way! Davis! We have to help Stiles hook the booster. You've got to help! What's happening here? Why isn't the rover responding? The rovers, the missiles, they're completely offline. That's it then. That was our last chance to save Earth. Everybody make peace with your God. Now, excuse me, I have to contact my family. So that's it? We just let the meteor hit Earth and billions of people die? No! We take our drill guns and we start drilling straight down at the base of that booster, right, Stiles? We have to try. Yes. -Let's drill! -Let's drill! [beeping] Davis! Come on! Stiles! Stay clear of the rocket! Drill down at least 45 feet! Just enough for me to set the charges! Copy that. Captain, the electrical system is still active. Once I boot it back up, we're good to go. Oh my God! Rocket number three accidentally triggered in the cave. Davis, go unhitch the three rockets! Now! Now! Copy! -Now! -Now? No! [screaming] Critical alert, Detroit has sustained catastrophic damage. Doctor, do you have any other course of action to keep this meteor shower? Fire all remaining ordnance as high as possible and target the biggest pieces. We've already deployed all of our assets. Every ship, every sub, every tank, every aircraft, everything we got. Sir, shelter in place orders are devolving into chaos. Emergency systems keep calling us, completely overwhelmed. I told you to call in an evac and the National Guard ages ago. Sir, it doesn't matter. Every city in the world is devolving into panic and violence. Countdown to impact the six minutes. It's my fault. Jacobs, Turner, Stiles, this whole mission was my fault. No, no, no, it's not your fault. But she's gone and so is our whole ignition system. No, not necessarily, not the ignition system. The way to fire remotely, yes, that's gone. Any way of triggering it electronically is gone. So we're screwed. No, not yet. We still have four rockets and four fuel lines. You remember Mills' plan? Yeah. Light it from the inside. I think I can still trip the fuel valves manually. Okay. Davis, it's Mills, do you copy? Go, Mills. Oh, thank God. Davis, I'm only in your com. What's the status? Jacobs is gone. So is Stiles. Shit, man. Mills, we're at the site, but the detonator... Listen, Davis, there was damage to the fuel line. All right, we lost a lot, but I repaired it. So we can get off this damn rock. Okay, we deploy this thing, we ignite it, and then we get out. I have enough O2 to get back to the ship and then I have another canister there. What is it? You're the pilot. Mills can't do this on his own. As for me... I'll be out of O2 before we're halfway back. Someone needs to stay and finish the job. You need to go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We can split my canister, okay? I have enough O2 to split it. Then we have to hurry, because just like Jacobs said, we can use the rover path like a train track back to the ship. Davis! Go. You have a child on the way. There's no reason for anyone else to die on this mission. Evan, you have Mason. The ignition Starter needs to be held in place before detonation, because of the damage it sustained during the explosion. Go. [grunts] Williams, bloody hell you're a sight for sore eyes. Right back at you. Okay, get ready for launch. Going for launch. I love you. Take care of your mom for me. Ready. [buzzing] [rumbling] Ah! Sir, we have ignition on the far side of the meteor. The rockets are pushing the meteor off course. Doctor, is the meteor moving? General, the rockets have fired. Moving four degrees... eight degrees. It's gonna miss the earth by thousands of miles. Copy that. Sergeant, alert all the other entities. The meteor is changing course. Mission accomplished. Well done. [applause] The meteor is changing course by 19 degrees. [laughing] I hear you, Williams. Job well done. Rick... Davis. He was the one who triggered the device. He had to stay behind to do it, Rick. You know, I suspected... I suspected as much. It doesn't make it any easier. We're grateful for him. Grateful for all of you. You too, Doctor. We all owe you one. We couldn't have done this without you, Rick. When it came time to do our job, we all did it. Mrs. Davis, your husband left you this. Thank you. I have a feeling this might be my last message. So let me start by saying what an honor it is to defend my family, my country, and my planet. Lisa, tell Mason I love him. Tell him Daddy's doing this for him. For his future, for his children's future. Oh, and, uh... look... I'm bringing this with me. Tell Mason every time he looks up at the sky, this spaceman's going to be looking down on him. Cheering him on forever. I love you both so much. It's the reason for the mission. Love. Love is the reason we're deciding to save the planet. Think about how close we came to wiping it all away. Let's build a better Earth together. I love you so much.
