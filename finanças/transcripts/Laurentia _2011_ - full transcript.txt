Apparently, there wasn't a young person in the place. Everyone had grey hair. So the guys get to their seats. And there's a pile of coats and purses on their seats. It takes them 10 minutes to make the people understand they have to clear the seats. And the old people are sighing. They're outraged that someone would be late for a Charlebois show. You're not supposed to be late for Robert Charlebois! $14, please. - How much? - I don't have any cash, man. $14. No, it's cool, guys. - It's my turn! - Thanks. Just give me $4. OK. Thanks a lot. Thank you. - Right then... Cheers! - Cheers, guys! Well... So, anyway, right, the guys don't feel welcome at the show. And they also find it really boring. So they decide to pretend that the show is really good. They decide to pretend the show's really good, so they start to sing and then to dance. And they lay it on real thick. And then the crowd starts to notice. The crowd turns and they tell the guys.. ''Calm down, take it easy.'' What the fuck is their problem? So? So? The crowd starts to shout at the guys, but the more they're told to shut it, the more it winds them up. So now the guys are totally cranked and start to boo the crowd and then Robert Charlebois. The guys start shouting out some fucking intense stuff, like.. ''Fuckin' lousy baby-boomer gig!'' Come on! I don't believe it! I swear, man that's what he told! me. And so, apparently, even the... What's that stuck up your ass, man? Fuckin' bunch of morons. You got nothing else to do? What? Cool it, man. - Go to hell, fucker. - Hey, let it go. Forget about them. Right, so security comes in and stops the show. And Robert Charlebois says something like.. ''Look at today's youth.'' And J.F. answers.. ''Hey! Go fuck yourself, you boomer! ''When are you going to die anyway?'' I don't know who has a fucking problem. No. It's cool, man. Everything's fine. Damn it, Louis. Hey! Hey! Stop it. Calm down, please. Everyone calm down, OK? - Shut up! Sit down! - It's cool. It's all cool. OK, everyone calm down. Louis, fuck! AUTUMN ALMOST LAID BARE SHIMMERING GOLD FORESTS AND THIS DUSK LIGHT LEAKING AT THE HORIZON'S EDGE ENOUGH TO MAKE ME CRY OUT IN ANGUISH ALL THESE THINGS l AM STRIPPED OF I know, they're little assholes. You didn't have to fight them for that. Look, what's done is done. Will you stop whining? Fucking goddamn anglo shitheads. Show me. No, it's not that bad. What? What is it? Goddamn fucking anglos. Calm down. This isn't Palestine. - Don't encourage him. - Give me a break. You should have hit like that earlier. Come on! Fuck, Louis. No, wait. There. That's how you do it. There you go, fucker. Come on. Get angry! Take that, fucker! - Do it! - OK, OK, calm down now. Come on. A little effort. No, wait, wait. Come on! Take that, fucker! Oh yeah. - Take that, fucker! - OK, that's enough! Fuck! Louis, fuck! Somebody's fuckin' going to call the cops! Goddamn fucking piece of shit province! Louis, stop it! You're going to hurt yourself. OK, I'm getting the fuck out of here, man! Shit! What are you doing, Dave, shit! Hey, I'm getting the fuck out of here, man! Dave, what the fuck are you doing? Louis, stop it now. Louis! Fuck! Louis, stop, shit! Fuck, Louis! Fuck! You're losing it, man, fuck! What's that? Dave! What do we do now? Forget it, man. Come on, we can't let Dave... Dave, wait! Yes. I... Yeah. Thanks. Louis. It's not serious. It doesn't hurt. I'm not a doctor, but... It's just that, yesterday... If I work until October then l can stop. And I'll have one year of maternity leave. - One year! - Really? Yeah. That's good. What about Martin? How's he handling it with his job? He only has one week off. But he has paid vacation days accumulated this year. So he'll take them when l give birth, and then he'll just work four days a week until Christmas. We're happy. It's pretty good when you work for the city. - Yeah. - There's always a way. That's true. Yeah. But when you think about it, we have it pretty good here too. When Seb's girlfriend had her first one last year, Raymond would let him leave early to take the baby to the doctor. - It's also fun. - Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly why l stay at this job. You know, l could find a better salary somewhere else. But the conditions in our department are hard to beat. Makes a big difference. Since l want more than one child... For sure. What about you, Louis? You and Rosalie isn't it time you had kids? We're in no hurry. Speaking of which, how is your Rosalie doing? She's good. It's been a while since we've seen her, no? So how was her trip? It was fine. She must have handed in her thesis by now? Yeah. Will we see her at Guy's farewell party? That's on Thursday, right? Then... no. It completely slipped my mind. We planned something else. l have to go now. I'm a little busy. Well... OK. See you. Hello? Hello? ONLY LET ME CLOSE MY EYES ONLY LET ME LAY THE PALMS OF MY HANDS ON MY EYELIDS ONLY LET ME SEE YOU NO MORE SO l CANNOT SPY THROUGH THE THICK SHADOWS THE HEAVY GATES OF FORGETFULNESS SLOWLY SWINGING OPEN No, l stopped it. - Look at me now. - I'm looking, lI'm looking. Hey! Fucking madman! - Do you have it? - Yes. Here, l got it. - Get set. - Right. - Another beer, guys? - No, I'm fine. Hey, I'll have another, if there's still some left. Come on. Loser. The loser's winning six to two. Thanks. You OK? Louis? I'm OK, man. Thanks for being here, guys. THE VOID BECKONS, l AM AFRAID I CALL UPON GOD TO CURL UP AND FOREVER SLEEP I WOULD LIKE TO BE A MAGICIAN SO l COULD VANISH AT ONCE WHEN THE IMPOSSIBLE APPROACHED. PART III ABYSSES AND FROM THIS CLIFF UPON WHICH WE STAND OUR SIGHT RESTS UPON THE SEA AND OUR ARMS LIE AT OUR SIDES LIKE USELESS OARS OUR SIGHTS SUFFER UPON THE SEA LIKE GREAT PITIFUL HANDS TWO POOR UNMOVING HANDS ALL-KNOWING AND INCAPABLE Hi.

It's beautiful, isn't it? MY COUNTRYMAN HAS BARELY RISEN FROM THE EARTH AND HIS FIRST LETTER IS DARK FOLIAGE AND HIS FEATURES A SHAPELESS AND AWKWARD FANCY THIS MAN THAT IS TAKING HIS FIRST STEPS UPON THE EARTH TRAINS HIMSELF FOR THE ORIGINAL GESTURE AND HIS WRISTS BLEED UPON THE WILD STONES AND WORDS SCORCH HIS MOUTH AND THE TOOL BREAKS IN HIS CLUMSY HANDS AND IT IS ALL HIS YOUTH THAT BURSTS INTO TEARS. Well, I think he wants to see his daddy now. And please put that out, Dad. I think it's his mom that's fed up with taking care of him. Hey, l didn't make this baby all on my own. True, true. Hey, wait a minute, there. All right! Now you're talking. Rhubarb pie! Your mother made it. Rosalie, my dear, we're so happy to have you here with us. - We really missed you. - I'm happy too. No, no, leave that. You've done enough. Go find your boyfriend. Anybody want ice cream? I'll have some, thanks. - There you go. - Thanks. Rosalie, do you want to hold him? Well, OK. Here. Fill yourself up with your mother's pie. There you go. Perfect. Thanks, dear. Alberte, your pie doesn't look half bad. The crust's not burnt. He never quits. Is he going to annoy me until the end of my days with that story? What story? The story of my first rhubarb pie. I was a newlywed. I'd never cooked a pie in my life. - And his mother is a pie expert. - That's right. And of rhubarb pie above all else. So, l had my mother-in-law's recipe. And then... ~My name is Louis Despres. ~I'm 28 years old. ~I'm an audio-visual technician. ~I live at 2344A D'Orleans Street in Montreal. ~In the Province of Quebec. ~I live next door to Jay Kashyap, ''who is 25 years old. ~I admit to having killed Jay Kashyap last August 16th ~In his apartment on D'Orleans Street in Montreal. ~I acted alone. ~After attending a party organized by Mr. Kashyap, ~I spent the night in a nearby park. ~Once l got back to my apartment, ~l took out a screwdriver and knocked at Jay Kashyap's door. ~He opened the door a few moments later. ~I immediately assaulted, him with the screwdriver ~repeatedly stabbing him in the chest. ~When he stopped resisting, ~I dragged his body to the back of his apartment. ~I then noticed that he was dead. ''I hereby confirm ''that this declaration was made of my own freewill, ''without any promises or threats. ''In witness whereof, I sign, in Montreal, August 24th, 2010.'' Is that OK with you? Yes. You have to sign here... and here. Will you be alright? Listen, you'll have to wait here a few hours before they transfer you. If you get hungry while waiting, just say so. They'll bring you something. In the meantime, I'm going to hand in your deposition. I FEEL A GREAT WARINESS AND WANT TO SUCCUMB TO INERTIA AS IF TO A SPELL.
