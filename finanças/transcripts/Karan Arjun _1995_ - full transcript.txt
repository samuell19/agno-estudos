This story is based on faith. Faith which makes the impossible happen. Faith that renders the impossible possible. This is one such story bound by cords of faith. Here, 10 rupees... Hey! Where are you going? Give me baksheesh or I'll have you sacked! Put in some money or you'll lose your job. Put it in there. Karan Singh and Arjun Singh, put in my baksheesh. - Don't cut our money today. - What's so special today? - It's a secret. - What secret? - We'll tell you later. - Don't cut 2 rupees. Keep the entire day's wage tomorrow. Is that so? I trust you because you're Durga's sons but don't go back on your word tomorrow. Rs.20 for me tomorrow! Father, it's Sunday tomorrow. It's a holiday. Good-bye! Did you spring from the skies, buddy? Never mind that. Just tell me how much the bangles cost. Why must you buy bangles? Don't bother about that. Just tell us how much the bangles cost. - Show me that. - No. This green one. - These red bangles. - These golden ones. - These colourful ones. - They're indeed beautiful. Arjun! - I win, right, Mom? - No! I won! Sons, you win or lose in a contest and only enemies compete. - I touched your feet first. - No! I did! - I did...! - Stop it. You're still racing against each other! You're not ahead... nor are you behind. But my sons are ahead of everyone else! - Mom, we've got something for you. - What is it? - First shut your eyes. - What for? - Close your eyes! Go on! - Alright. Open your eyes now. Mom, you'll wear bangles now, like other women in the village. We just can't bear to see your wrists so bare. Hold out your hand, mom. Come on, mom. No! I can't wear those bangles. - What? Why not? Hey, silly boys, I can't wear bangles at my age. I understand, mom! She'll only wear the bangles when Dad returns from the city. - Isn't that true? - It's already been years. He would've returned if he wanted to. - He's forgotten us! - There's not a word from him. And you're always waiting for him! C'mon, let's return the bangles. No... wait! Give me those bangles... give them to me. I'll give these bangles to your wives. - But they were meant to... - Go and bathe quickly. ~ When is the sun far from the sky ~ When is the moon far from its rays ~ When is fragrance far from the wind? ~ When is springtime far from the garden? ~ This bond is a bond of love ~ It is the poem of many births ~ You're my life ~ I'll live just looking at you ~ You're my life ~ I'll live just looking at you ~ Only for you ~ I'll drink the poison of the world ~ In your sacred lotus feet ~ I'll make the sky to bow down ~ Should there be embers in your path ~ Then I'll spread myself out for you ~ This bond is a bond of love ~ It's a union of many births ~ This bond is a bond of love ~ It's a union of many births ~ Of the temple of motherly love ~ You're the most beloved idol ~ Of the temple of motherly love ~ You're the most beloved idol~ ~I can see God ~Whenever I see your face ~ Whenever I'll come in this world ~ I will only find your veil ~ Upon the wall separating births, we will inscribe our love ~ This bond is a bond of love ~ It is the poem of many births ~ This bond is a bond of love ~ It is the poem of many births ~ - Greetings, madam. - The accountant? You? I managed to get here with great difficulty. If someone saw me come here, my life would be in danger. But what brings you here so late at night? The elder Thakur has summoned you to the mansion. Which mansion? The one that shut the doors on our good-fortune? The mansion whose wounds are still raw in our hearts? Go away. I'll never step inside that mansion. Fulfilling a dying man's last desire... is considered to be the greatest of noble deeds. What? Is the Thakur...? Yes. The landlord is breathing his last. His last wish is to see you. But as long as cursed Durjan Singh casts his shadow there... how can I go there? Tomorrow's the festival of Goddess Kali. Durjan, with his brothers-in-law, Nahar and Shamsher Singh... will be at the temple with their families. I'll wait for you outside the mansion. - Please be there. - Very well. - Who was that man? - And who's the old Thakur? I've kept a secret from you for many years. How was I to know that time would one day stoke its fires? It's the story of my life... which I've always kept secret from you. But I have to tell you the truth today. I will tell you everything. The old Thakur is your grandfather. - What?! - The Thakur?! Our grandfather? Yes. I'm his daughter-in-law. I was a poor woman and your father married me. but the landlord was stirred up by Durjan Singh, his nephew... and he refused to accept me as his daughter-in-law. I was driven out of the mansion. Your father found a job in a school in the village. We were happy in our own world, despite our poverty. And your arrival brought more joy and happiness in our lives. But our happiness soon turned to grief. Durjan Singh dreamt of inheriting the family riches and one night, in sheer treachery... Durjan Singh killed your father! What?! Was father... You mean you always...? Yes. To keep this tale a secret, I concocted a story. I didn't want you to feel orphaned. How was I to know someday my past would come knocking on my door? I have to go to the mansion that I've always loathed! No. We won't go to the mansion that snatched our father! Yes. We won't as much as step in the place... that plunged you in poverty and despair. I know how the fires of hatred are stoked... when one is reminded of the humiliation one has undergone but I always imparted to you lessons in love and compassion, not hatred. Hatred can only make man and society drift apart. Hatred is the devil's shadow, my sons. It's the devil's shadow! Hail, Goddess Kali! Welcome, madam... The Thakur's been speaking about you since morning. He's longing to see Karan and Arjun. Please come in. Welcome, daughter-in-law. Please don't touch me... I am a sinner! No, father. What happened was part of our destiny. No. My arrogance eclipsed your destiny. I thrust my own blood in the fires of misfortune. I should be severely punished... a terrible death no sinner has suffered so far! Don't say that. The ointment of time heals every wound inflicted by life. Before I die, just once... won't you give me the right to hug them? What right? Our lives are for you. Karan and Arjun are your children. Go, my children. My children! I'm truly unfortunate. I couldn't play with you. I'm returning the right I snatched from you. Now you are mistress of this mansion and your sons are its heirs. Take this. The body becomes useless in old age... but you ruined your life! You poisoned my life! Go away from here! I didn't come to this mansion to go away! Every brick of this house is mine! I served you all your life! You tried to kill me every moment! But I didn't die. I had a debt to pay, to give these kids their rights! I won't give these beggars one penny! Instead I'll give you and this family of yours, death! No! I bind you by oath. We want nothing! Not a thing! You may take everything. We want nothing at all! What are you saying? You called me daughter-in-law and held my sons close to your heart. We've got all the wealth in the world. We want nothing else. Come on, children. Brother-in-law, you left those two snakes alive? Snakes can raise their fangs anytime. They're a snake's young ones, not snakes. They haven't yet cut their poison fangs. Their father was the snake. The sons will die at my hands just as their father did! What? You killed my son? Yes. I did. And his children will die at my hands. - No! This can't happen! - This will happen! Your entire family is doomed to die at my hands! Look at this, old man! You'll see the dark shadow of your death in my palm! Run! Run, children! Leave my sons be! - Leave my Karan and Arjun! - Leave these little snakes? The game's just begun, old lady. It will be great fun! Look there, old lady! Look there! Stop it! You bit! Mother! Mother! You hit my mother? Let's run away! Go! Run, Arjun! I'm telling you to run! Mother! My sons can't die! My sons can't die... This can't happen! You are also a mother. A mother can't destroy another mother's womb! My sons are the boon given to me at your step! You can't take back a gift you've given once! You have to return my sons! Return my sons to me, Mother! Return my sons to me, Mother! Return my sons to me, Mother! Push harder. Bit more. ~ KARAN ARJUN ~ Ate his mother soon as he was born! Now will you eat my liquor bottle? I don't have money for booze! Where can I get cash for your milk? Don't cry, son. Our son will grow into a big man. Even God will be proud of him. All thanks to Peston bhai. I make a living working in his Riding Club. It's the Lord who does everything. Who knows, maybe your son will run my Riding Club tomorrow! Got booze? No. I'm hungry. I got food. Rascal! When small, you cried for milk! And now for food! - Get me some booze! - No, I won't! Arguing with your father! - Let go my hand! - No! First let go the bag! Little guy, but strong as a horse! - Won't let me go? - Bastard! What happened, son? He was stealing grams so I hit him. Wow! What an aim! What happened to you suddenly? Will you kill him? Why are you hitting him? He was fighting for you. This boy called you a drunk so Ajay thrashed him. Control your son. Kids without mothers turn out like this. Mom, I will return! I'm with you, son! - I'll return, mom! - No need to worry. He's hallucinating. It happens with fever. Mom! Mom! My son. Priest... Did you hear? Did you? My son called out to me! They will come. My Karan and Arjun will return! Durgha. I've been listening for 20 years... Karan and Arjun will come... but this world is such a place... once destroyed, the people of this world never return. Wait and see. My Karan and Arjun will return! They'll definitely return! Karan and Arjun will return? Mad old woman! My father, Durjan Singh, gave them such a terrible death... that even God will think twice before sending them here! Move aside! Crazy old woman! Looks like you still don't believe your sons are dead. Take this and garland the photo with it. Look at it everyday so you're convinced your sons are no more. This is from me. From me. - Priest. - Yes. - My son is going abroad. I've brought him here for Goddess Kali's blessings so that he returns successful in his mission. After tormenting one mother... you're begging another mother for her blessings? You'll have to beg my sons. Beg them for your lives... to let you live. Remember! these 3 garlands... If I don't garland your corpses with these... I'm not worthy of my name Durga! Remember this, Durjan. My sons will return! My Karan and Arjun will return! Stupid woman! How can the dead return? They'll tear the earth apart and come! They'll rip open the skies to come! That guy's finished! Hit him! You were great! You performed a miracle by defeating the favourite Kalia! Look. A shower of cash! Here's your share. From today you're the favourite here. Eunuch! You'll marry me? I'll scramble your brains! Dad, she's abusing us! Get lost! You won't ever find a groom like me! You seem to live in this area. Is she a girl or boy? Who are you asking? I'll tell you what I am. Run! Eunuch! See that? He was the fifth specimen. Before my Dad gives my hand to somebody else... hold my hand. He doesn't care about you but you chase him like a fool. What's special about him that you only want him? Dad, he has what nobody else has. He slapped me once in childhood... on my cheek, but it left its imprint on my heart. But the day you get slapped, you'll forget finding grooms for me! No! It's nothing, nothing... it's medicine. Liquor in a medicine bottle? I slog hard to buy medicines and you have this poison? I want to save you and you want to die? There's still time. Change yourself! Great! Simply superb! Fantastic or elastic, any girl who comes here makes him her teacher. How'd you learn such excellent horse riding and marksmanship? I put my heart into it to learn. If you put your heart into it, you'll learn too. His heart's in it, too. I see you come half an hour early every day. What do I do? Since coming here, I don't like being at home. Like a kite pulled by its string... I'm in the same boat. Maybe that's afflicted you. - What? - That. But in just two meetings, it happens that Mogambo... Mogambo? Who's Mogambo? My horse. Yes, I'm attracted to Mogambo and somebody else, too. Somebody else? Who? - Really? - Yes. - Swear. - By me. Sonia. I can see it in your eyes but I want to hear it, too. - With a kiss... - With the catapult. - Huh? Catapult? How'd this catapult enter a love scene? People love hearts, and you fell in love with a catapult? Go on. Have my catapult, if not my heart. - I don't know how. - You only know how to shoot arrows. I'll teach you. Hold this with the right hand, and this with the left. And pull it. Now hold it tight. Who's this fat hippo? My body guard. Papa sent him with me. If somebody bothers me, he tells him LL. Yeah, lame and mutilated. Oh. Let's see. Hippo, where are you going? - You! - Yes, me. - Baby...! - Baby, yeah. - What did you do? - I kissed her. Carefully. He threw me! Rascal! A hippo on a horse? Where's my gun? Madam, looks like I have to teach you something else besides horse riding and marksmanship. - What's that? One kisses on the lips, not cheeks... - here. - I'll learn that, too. Where's the ruffian? I won't spare him! What's he think of himself? Was it a terrible fight? The hearts liked each other, and sliced the villain. My ears were smoking! - You would be, too... - What? - Smoking. - From where? - Mouth, ear, nose... I'll roast you if you say another word! Always mouthing double meanings! Who was that hoodlum? A thorn with the flower. I threw it out! Well done, son! As long as you sort out these hoodlums, my Riding club will survive. Who'd look after the stable, if not for you? I'm indebted to you. No, uncle. I'm indebted to you. You supported me after my parents died... loved me like a son... educated me, gave me a job. Your Dad was my friend. Whatever I did was for friendship. Come on. It's time for your riding students to arrive. I was talking about him. Only he can take on a hundred. - If you meet him once... - I'll meet him. You're home, child? - Hold the mug high. - Huh? - A bit higher. - Come on. Here. - What childishness is this? - Catapult. I've been practising but I can't get my aim right. You went to riding lessons. So where'd this come from? What one plans never happens, and what isn't planned does and what you never think of happens sometimes. I mean, it was great! Did you follow what she said? Yes. I'm not so stupid. - Good day, sir. - Whenever I leave my mansion... I think of one other world, the one of our friendship. This friendship will soon turn into a relationship. Your son Suraj is going to become my son-in-law. Suraj and Sonia can be engaged when he returns from London. Saxena, enough sweet talk. Let's talk something bitter now so poison doesn't spread in our friendship. I still haven't got payment for my goods. The party I gave the goods to is delaying payment. Since he's dangerous, I want to... When it comes to money, I'm very amoral. Let alone friends and foes, I don't hesitate to kill my own people. My payment should reach me within a week. Why'd you stop the car? Look in front. Move aside. Seeing her eyes, I feel... Goddess Kali resides in her! If she confidently says her sons are coming, they must be en route... - Accountant! - I'm just... Brother-in-law, finish this old hag's story today! Brother-in-law, her words pierce like a needle! Crush her. What are you saying? She's already dead. Warriors don't assault women! - I say crush the old hag! - No, no! What are you doing? Why do you get involved with them? They terrorize the whole village. Why do you want to kill yourself? If I had to die, I'd have died long ago. But death can't destroy me till I've destroyed them. My sons will come to destroy them... The weapons of a mother. Karan and Arjun will come. Mom! Mom. Run, Arjun! Run, Arjun! What's going on? People walk in their sleep. Do you talk in your sleep? Can you see me? My heart's beating like a neck-slit chicken! My bones are knocking about like coins on a carom board! Who do you talk to in your sleep? I don't know. But I could see strange shadows right from my childhood. I feel as if I have some relation to them. I have some deep bond with them. Something drags me into it... calls out to me. And what happened today... has never happened before. What happened? There's a village... bells in a temple... a path... and I saw myself. I'm running and somebody screams... Run, Arjun, run! Run, Arjun, run! Ajay, your father vomited blood. Doctor said he's seriously ill. Liquor destroyed his liver. We have to operate on him. - How much money is needed? - 10,000. Fine, do the operation. - What? You'll lose this fight? - Yes. Today I have to win against death. It's a matter of my Dad's life. I need 10,000 bucks. Another shower of cash! Cash? How, partner? He's the favourite. People will bet on him but we'll win because he'll lose. And we won't have to pay anyone! But will you really lose? 10,000. Is there anyone else? There is! Local favourite, Ajay. Isn't the one who got thrashed the one in the photo you showed me? Yes..but I don't understand how the tide turned. What are you doing? We'll be ruined! What are you doing? Stop it. What are you doing? You needed 10,000 bucks! You said you'd lose the fight! But you ruined us by winning it! What's wrong with you? I wanted to lose the fight but I don't know what happened to me. A lifetime remains for you to know who I am but at this moment your father only has a couple of moments. Here. And this is my card. - Who are you? - My name is Ajay. - Is Mr. Saxena at home? - Yes, sit. I'll call him. - Who are you? - My name is Ajay. But there's no one named Ajay in Mr. Saxena's home. I'm a guest. Sir, all of us are guests in this world. Still, my phone line got linked with yours. In the course of talking, our hearts may be linked too and we could become friends. So, are we friends? I'm not interested. Sir, you appear a strict man. I just lit my father's funeral pyre. I'm sorry brother.. Please call Sonia. I'm Vijay. Excuse me... there's a call for Sonia. Tell him Sonia's left. She's left. Sonia, dear, hurry up! We have to go to the airport to meet Suraj. - She just left. - You? How's your father? He's gone. Here's your 8000 bucks. I spent 2000 to cremate him. I'll pay it back soon. I like your sense of self-respect. - Will you work for me? - Work for you? Your strength, your obsession, the fire smoldering in your eyes... I like them. Will you work? I'd refuse someone else but I'm indebted to you. - I'll begin tomorrow. - Not tomorrow, right now. We have to go to the airport. - How was the trip? - Fantastic. - Where's Sonia? - She's waiting anxiously at home. Go on, my white Mercedes is outside. You go ahead. I'll clear Customs and come. Is this Mr. Saxena's car? Put this briefcase in the car. Didn't you hear what I said? Put this briefcase in the car! I'm not your father's servant! You dare disrespect my father?! Keep your right hand in your pocket or you'll have to eat with your left hand forever. I think you've introduced yourselves. He's Ajay, a superb fighter, and he's Suraj Singh, Sonia's fianc?e. ~ I'm going ~ What's the rush? ~ My heart's racing! ~ Well, why's that? ~ I'm going ~ What's the rush? ~ My heart's racing! ~ Well, why's that? ~ I've begun to fear even myself! ~ I've started to fall in love! ~ If you fear yourself so ~ however will you love? ~ I'm going ~ What's the rush? ~ My heart's racing! ~ Well, why's that? ~ The magic of your body draws me to you ~ When I look at you, I lose control of myself ~ Why do you think we'd lose our balance? ~ Don't you have faith in my love? ~ I'm sure of you ~ I'm not sure about myself! ~ I'm going ~ What's the rush? ~ My heart's racing! ~ Well, why's that? ~ I've begun to fear even myself! ~ I've started to fall in love! ~ If you fear yourself so ~ however will you love? ~ I'm going ~ What's the rush? ~ My heart's racing! ~ Well, why's that? ~ I'll colour my life with the red of your lips ~ I'll embrace you in dreams ~ as long as I live ~ I'll colour my life with the red of your lips ~ I'll embrace you in dreams ~ as long as I live ~ Get a hold of yourself ~ Let me master my emotions ~ I'll lose my wits; don't give me so much love! ~ Love is insanity; it has no use for good sense ~ I'm going ~ What's the rush? ~ My heart's racing! ~ Well, why's that? ~ I've begun to fear even myself! ~ I've started to fall in love! ~ If you fear yourself so ~ however will you love? ~ I'm going ~ What's the rush?..... ~ - My heart's racing! - Well, why's that? ~ I'm going... ~ Uncle...since I came here, that's all I hear. Sonia's on her way, she'll soon be here. It's turned to evening and there's no sign of Sonia... Here comes Sonia! And you didn't come to the airport nor were you home! I want to tell you so much and hear so much! Will you listen to me first, or tell me about yourself? Now what do I listen to, and what do I tell you? - What? - If you listen to me, you'll forget yourself. And if you forget yourself, what will you remember about me? And if you won't remember, what's the use telling you? And what's the point doing something useless? Am I right? Bye. What did she say? Uncle, did you get it? Son, I'm not so stupid. Did you see? This gun can pierce a 3-inch steel sheet. It can shatter bullet proof glass. Like people select pearls in deep waters... I selected this deadly gun from abroad. And this is not a joke, have a look! Gentleman, in a month, these guns will be delivered at the borders. As usual, these guns will reach me through Durjan Singh and I'll give them to you. Place your order for any number of guns. Isn't clear? Yes!! Uncle, I think one of our customers hasn't come. - Sure. - Has he rebelled? - No. He's become dishonest. He didn't pay me for the goods from last time. And whenever I sent my men to collect the money... they didn't return alive. So he swallowed our money? Such a man isn't born! I created a man of steel to get even with him. Peter, talk to your men on the phone. Ask them to make my payment or remove your corpse! What's up? Trying to look good today? Take this. That clears all my debts. Alright, Sir. You're repaying all your debts. - When will you repay mine? - What'd I take from you? You took what nobody could ever take from me. You don't get it? You took this girl's heart. What? You, a girl? What heart? Go look in the mirror. You don't look like a girl from any angle. I'm not a girl...? ~ There's a guy my age, there's guy's my age... ~ Look, he doesn?t even know the language of the heart ~ O cruel one! Look, he doesn?t even know the language of love ~ There's a guy my age, there's guy's my age... ~ Look, he doesn?t even know the language of the heart ~ O cruel one! Look, he doesn?t even know the language of love ~ My bangles are jingling just to call you' ~ I?m dressing up just to show you ~ My bangles are jingling just to call you ~ I?m dressing up just to show you ~ If it doesn?t make you go crazy, so crazy ~ then what use is this body of mine? ~ O cruel one! Then what use are these looks of mine? ~ Tell me why you steal your gaze from me ~ Who feels abashed in front of someone close? ~ Tell me why you steal your gaze from me ~ Who feels abashed in front of someone close? ~ Strike your gaze with mine ~ I?ll show you the way that leads to my heart ~ O cruel one! I?ll show you the way that leads to my heart ~ There's a guy of my age... ~ Look, he doesn?t even know the language of love ~ O cruel one! Look, he doesn?t even know the language of love ~ What's the matter? Nothing. I felt... as if these bangles... I can only buy you glass bangles, not gold ones. What's wrong with you today? - What are you saying? - Yes, Sonia... I did fall in love with you but I never thought... you're a princess and I'm the dust of the roads. - Will I be able to give you all... - You mean wealth is everything? No. Money helps man buy expensive things but not a heart. Man can buy food with money but not hunger. Man can buy a body with money, but not true love! Love is the greatest wealth in the universe, the greatest. You and I have got it, so much. Your love and affection. They're the treasures of my life. I'll never let them go away from me. I want to see you in palaces and you chose a horse groom as your life partner! Not just my life partner, we promised to live and die together! Your anger and cruelty can't change our minds. I'll change his life! I'll destroy him! I can do anything, anything! Can you carry your daughter's pyre on your shoulders? You're blind in his love. I'll show you when the time comes! I'll shoot you if you come out of the room tonight! You lead a peaceful life. You're very fortunate. You have no stress about food. I massage you, I serve you. Who serves me? Nobody. In the next life, I'll be born as a horse... and you'll be me. Why're you laughing? Hey, Lingaya! Why're you talking to horses? Do you have time to talk to me? You're busy diving in the swimming pool of love! The sea of love is very deep. If you drown... Hey! Drowning is what they call love, right? You've really become a lovesick Romeo in a week. The thrill isn't the same when you stake your life riding... as the thrill when you stake your heart in love. If you don't listen to me, your life will be at stake. I've brought your death in my hand! A tiger's death in a mosquito's hand? Who's this impediment in the path of love? I'm Sonia's fianc? and Durjan Singh's son. My name is Suraj Singh. Sir...! Burn the place! Take him away and go! Hurry! Love got burnt! Lover got burnt! Very good, son! To remove obstacles on the way and destroy enemies... is this family's tradition. So I've abided by the family's tradition. Fool! Jokes apart. Prepare for your engagement to Sonia. We're coming there. Today is the happiest day of my life because today I announce the engagement of my only... daughter, Sonia, to Durjan Singh's son, Suraj. Soon as he arrives, the custom of engagement will... Here he comes. Stop! You burned my Dad's stable! I'll burn your fingers! - Call the police. - No! Let go of me! Run! Arjun, run! Run! Arjun, run! I tell you to run! Arrest him! We're Thakurs by birth. Pride and anger course through the blood in our veins. Whenever our women step in the quicksand of disrepute... we bury them alive in the walls of our homes! But the love of my son holds me back. I always fulfilled my son's every dream and today I will fulfill this dream. You will marry my son in my house! Saxena. Prepare to leave. I don't understand anything. All of a sudden, why'd our hands stop fighting? And then why'd he tell me this? 'Run, Arjun!' And why'd I obey him? What did he say? Repeat it. 'Run, Arjun! Run!' Something's terribly wrong! This is the same phrase you uttered in your sleep! That's what I'm thinking. The words I kept saying in my sleep... I kept murmuring. The same words, the same name. How'd they come on my lips? Who? Who's this Arjun? Who are you? That's what I want to ask you. - Why does it feel as if... - We know each other? We have some deep bond. A cord draws us close to each other. We've met before. No. I don't even know your name. Then at the party, why'd you say...? 'Run, Arjun! Run!' I'm worried too. I can't understand. How'd those words come to my lips? Who forced me to say it? I don't know any Arjun. Neither do I. But it feels as if we have a strange tie to that name. Some old association. Anyway, my name is Vijay. Thanks for saving my life. God forbid, but if you ever face such a situation... I'll repay this debt. Letter from Sonia for you! Something seems fishy! Her servant brought it. What is it, son? They're forcibly taking my Sonia to Durjan Singh's mansion. She asked me to rescue her. She writes if I don't get there... she'll take poison and kill herself but won't marry Suraj. What're you thinking of? Prepare to leave. If I go, what happens to your stable? Your business...? Business goes on. But once lost, how will life return? She's your love. Go, my son. God be with you. That scum gave you these bangles, right? Throw them away. - Throw them away, dear. - No! This is my Vijay's memento. Not a memento! It's a forgotten story now! - No! - Remove them, dear. Funny station. Can't see a single person. We'll ask him. How far is Durjan Singh's mansion? What's he staring at? Uncle, where are you? This can't be true! I hope the mansion isn't haunted. The old man ran off at the name! Something's very fishy! - Come on. - Come. You've fallen in love but the game of love's very dangerous. Unless you play with danger, you don't relish life with love. Life isn't a delicacy to relish! What a village you brought me to! I don't see a single man here! Why're you looking in the pond? You want to go fishing? Bhaiya, I feel I've seen this place before. What are you saying? I've known you since your childhood among the horses. Something's fishy here! No, Lingaya. I worked here. Huge boulders used to be lifted here. You're right, sir. People say camels lifted boulders here many years ago. Around here somewhere, there's a bangle market? There's a big market. Did you come out of the earth or jump from heaven? Forget that and tell us the price of the bangles. All of a sudden, bangles? Show me these. These ones. Yes, these colourful ones. Arjun? What did you say? I can't believe it! You're Arjun. - Who's Arjun? - The light of that woman's eyes that was extinguished by evil men. His name was Arjun. I've heard this name many times. I've seen this temple in my dreams. I can't understand any of this. What is all this? Mother Kali! This means... you performed this miracle! The impossible was born as the possible! You are Arjun, child, Goddess Kali's boon... the boon asked for at this place. Which mother? Whose? Your mother. My mother? My son has come! My son has come! My Arjun has come. My son has come. My son... Mother! Mom. Where did you go, leaving me alone? Where had you gone, my son? I shed a lot of tears in sorrow for you. There's no place or path in this village... where I didn't look for you. Had you gone very far that it took so long to return? Speak up, my son. I've grown old. My eyes have grown weak but my belief didn't grow weak. I was sure you would come. You will surely repay the debt of maternal love. The Goddess heard my prayers and you've come! My son! No, my son. Don't cry. I cried enough for all of us. Don't cry. You didn't bring Karan? When will he come? If Arjun has come, Karan will come, too, Mom. Don't cry. I've only been sentenced for 6 months. When I get out of jail, I'll sort out each of Saxena's family! - Where'd they take him? - Prison. Ajay, the other day you asked who I was. Today I bring not only my but also your introduction. You're Karan, and I'm Arjun. We've been reborn. And our mother is still waiting for us to return. The sun gets tired and sets but the mother's eyes keep looking out for her sons. She stays awake. ~ People pass away in death ~ but faith and belief does not die ~ The impossible is found turning... ~ into the possible through belief ~ The dreams turn out to be true ~ Each and every prayer is useful ~ The bond of faith is such that... ~ it pulls loved ones closer together ~ this relation is one of love ~ it is a relation of birth ~ it is a bond of relationship ~ Hey, why's a crowd gathered? Did somebody fall off a horse? Let me see. Finished! The Thakur's had it! He's had it! Hey, listen here! The Thakur's ended! Whom shall I give this good news to? Got it! We taste liquor daily. Shall we taste some village belle? Yes, Nahar. It's been weeks. We've neither hunted animals nor women. The hunting will start now, gentlemen. You're heading towards a cemetery in slippers! And I'm watching! Hey! What're you barking? I bark. I'm a dog. But you're goats. You'll be slaughtered. The Thakur's damned! - What is it? - The drama will take place. Both of them have returned. The landlord is damned! - Who? - The same. Those kids. Durga's son! Karan and Arjun. Which Karan and Arjun? The ones we killed years ago? The same Karan and Arjun? Yes! - Corpses don't come alive. - They did. A miracle happened. I advise you to pack up and go on a pilgrimage. My heart beats fast! The Thakur's damned! - Shamsher. I wonder if he is... - Yes, Nahar. If there's truth in what he says... we have to get to its roots. Let's see how the old lady's broken stick got joined again. Who are Karan and Arjun? Look at these boulders. We used to work here. What's up? Why're you quiet? You were even quiet when you met mother in front of the villagers and you're still quiet. - This can't be true. - Can't be true? Why not? I don't believe in this story of rebirth. It's all trash. Trash? All these villagers look at you and say Karan! Is that trash? A mother's heart held you close and called you her son. Is that trash? Couldn't you see the love behind the mother's tears? Is that mother lying? Is her love treachery? Is her waiting for years a pretence? But it's possible I'm born with her son's looks. If that's true, why'd you stop beating me at the party? Why'd you say, 'Run, Arjun! Run!'? It's because my name was Arjun in my last birth and you were Karan. We were her sons. And terrible injustice has been done to her! We were both killed and we've been reborn. Don't you recall anything even now? No! I recall nothing. Brothers! Shamsher and Nahar Singh are troubling your mother! I heard God sent you the support you need in old age? Where are they? Where are your children? Answer! Answer, old woman! Where are your Karan and Arjun? Answer! Talk, old woman! Will you answer? Talk! The son of this helpless mother has come to wipe her tears! Son? The same son we killed years ago? He's a look-alike of this old hag's son. I think he's a cheat from the city. You probably didn't hear the story of her sons' deaths. If you'd heard, you wouldn't dare step in this village! But now he's here, let's finish him too! I'm coming! Hit them, son! Let them know my sons have returned! ~ Let's bhangra!' ~ C'mon, c'mon! ~ Let's bhangra!... C'mon, c'mon! ~ Tell me, tell me, tell me, where is your heart? ~ My heart is where you are ~ If you get your life, my dear, don't lose it ~ While still alive, don't get separated from me ~ Let's bhangra!... C'mon, c'mon! ~ In the courtyard, the anklets will tinkle, the rivers will sing once more ~ In the courtyard, the anklets will tinkle, the rivers will sing once more ~ The smiles and desires - no-one can imprison them ever ~ Love shines from the eyes, the heart becomes restless ~ Everyone dances with wild abandon ~ Let's bhangra!... C'mon, c'mon! ~ Let's bhangra!... C'mon, c'mon! ~ Tell me, tell me, tell me, where is your heart? ~ My heart is where you are ~ While still alive, don't get separated from me ~ Let's bhangra!... C'mon, c'mon! ~ That which can cut the truth - where is there such a sword? ~ That which can cut the truth - where is there such a sword? ~ That which can hold love captive - where is there such a door? ~ Let no-one be helpless, let no-one be shattered by grief ~ Let no-one be helpless, let no-one be shattered by grief ~ Come, let's celebrate happiness! ~ Let's bhangra!... C'mon, c'mon! ~ Tell me, tell me, tell me, where is your heart? ~ My heart is where you are ~ If you get your life, my dear, don't lose it ~ While still alive, don't get separated from me ~ Fools! You got crazy drunk. You've gone into a world of illusions! You say Karan and Arjun thrashed you! The same Karan and Arjun who went to Hell? Our eyes can't deceive us. We saw their faces! How can we forget their faces? Yes. You can't forget, when someone thrashes you so badly! Whom are you discussing? Who are Karan and Arjun? Well, Saxena, the ones I had killed years ago. They say they returned alive and bashed them! How can that be? That's what I'm saying. You always rebuke my brothers. You don't believe them at all. - Shut up! - Ask him if you disbelieve us. Why ask me? If he doesn't believe you, how will he believe me? Alright. Ask the villagers. Villagers, I ask you who they are. Where are they? Who dares oppose me and wants death? Who are you talking of, Sir? They don't know! I'm talking of those two who hit my uncles. Who'd dare even lift a finger at them? Hey, old man! Why don't you say Karan and Arjun hit us like dogs? You make us liars before brother-in-law? Talk, old man, tell the truth that Karan and Arjun hit us! Where's the old woman, Durga? Durga's a mad woman wandering across villages. We haven't seen her in months. So where'd you see her? May you die! May a garland adorn your picture! May you lose your lives! I myself saw them... embracing Durga near the hills. Sir, Karan and Arjun have come to this village. You're not aware. Today, they pose a problem to everyone. Tomorrow, they may pose a problem to you... T-t-there they are! Nobody's there. Hey! Are you trying to frighten us? No, no... I saw them myself... I saw Karan and Arjun. Ask your brothers-in-law if you don't believe me. - Didn't you see them up top? - No. - You saw? - No. - You saw? - No! You'll get me killed! You sometimes agree and sometimes deny. You'll get me slapped! Isn't this an eggplant? Isn't this a carrot? Isn't this a radish? If I can call a carrot and radish by their names... can't I call Karan and Arjun by their names? They were Karan and Arjun for sure. Why look around? I said they were Karan and Arjun. Who's talking? Who spoke?! I'm talking, scum. I am! But why's the voice coming from inside? Fool! The voice is coming from under you, not inside. From under me? My voice comes from the top... I'm dead! Where'd the earthquake come from? From Latur! Who are you? You frightened me. I'm the villager who frightens and unveils the truth. But I've never seen you in the village. You call an eggplant a carrot, and a carrot a radish! You're implying there's some mistake in my eyes? No. Your head says you saw, your eyes say otherwise. Yes. That's what's happening with me. Listen to what your eyes say. Karan and Arjun are in this village. I saw them! I have to answer the Thakur for this slap. Could you say this to the Thakur? Let alone the Thakur, I can say it before everybody! Whatever the dire consequences, I won't shy from speaking the truth! I mean it when I say I saw Karan and Arjun. - Then come with me! - Where? Did you fix an auspicious time for Suraj and Sonia's wedding? Yes. The auspicious time is three days after 'Dassera'. I'll create such a sensation... my son's marriage will set an example in history. - Thakur, sir. Bless me, Sir. - You're here again? What did I get for my honesty and veracity? Here, betel leaf. Eat it. Madam, he slapped me very hard before the entire village. I even got hard evidence. Not only me, even the villagers have seen Karan and Arjun. - Which villagers? - H-h-he... Blessings, landlord! Get up! What did you see? See? What did I see? Oh God! Well-fed, strong, tall horses. They were galloping. Black, white, good and bad horses! Horses in the stables! Target practice in the stables! Catapults in the stables! In the stables... How the bottles broke! How catapults hit targets! How Mogambo galloped! Mogambo was amazing, sir! Why're you yelling? He told me you're hard of hearing. - When did I say so? - Didn't you say so at the door? You haven't said what I brought you here to say... about Karan and Arjun... What did you say? Nothing! Tell him about Karan and Arjun! Talk! - Who are Karan and Arjun? - You'll get me killed! You'll get me slapped! Hey, that... Karan and Arjun? They looked so dashing, sir! How they fought! They killed everybody one by one! Karan and Arjun are amazing! - Where'd you see them? - On TV, sir. He showed me 'Mahabharata' on T.V. He told me to tell you... that I'd seen Karan and Arjun and he gave me 100 rupees. No! No! No! Sir... he's... lying! - Have you come to joke with me? - No! From now on, if you play such a prank... you won't even be able to talk! Get out! - Let's go! - My work's done! Sonia. I am as close to you as your own heart beat. At the earliest opportunity, I'll free you and take you away. - Thakur's-daughter-in-law! - What are you doing? I'll go mad! I saw them with my own eyes. You must be very happy. Your powerful sons returned to answer Thakur's atrocities! But the villagers say they haven't come. You tell me whether they've come. How can a mother's sons stay away after hearing her call them? When a mother is tormented, even the skies are in turmoil. Karun and Arjun are with me. There they are. These are Karan and Arjun! O God! The same faces! Same bodies! Same eyes! The Thakur is dead for sure! Yes. Spring has returned to my dreary life. Durjan Singh started this war but my sons will finish it. I'm with you in this battle! Son. Check if everything's alright. Yes, Dad. They're the weapons I selected. - Take this. - We'll take the truck to the godown and dispatch it from there. Be careful. No mistakes this time or we'll suffer heavy losses. This concerns our profit, not just yours. We have as much a share in it as you do. Don't worry. - Go on then. - Alright But what's the hurry? First let the band play. What band? Whose band? Your band. His band, his, his too. - How? - It was your command. Right. You organized a party. I made such fantastic arrangements that you...! ~ Gup chup Gup chup Gup chup Shhh, quiet! ~ Why are you wearing this long veil? ~ Why are you wearing this long veil? ~ Have you done something wrong, lovely girl? ~ My friends whisper in my ear that... ~ last night you did some mischief! ~ Brother-in-law was sleeping on the roof ~ I thought he was asleep downstairs ~ Forgive me, my lord, I made a mistake ~ Brother-in-law was sleeping on the roof ~ I thought he was asleep downstairs ~ Forgive me, my lord, I made a mistake ~ Brother-in-law is still Brother-in-law ~ Couldn't you see it wasn't your husband? ~ Bro-in-law was covered in a shawl ~ I thought it was my husband there ~ He slept on half the bed ~ and I slept on the other half ~ Forgive me, my lord, I made a mistake ~ Light should've been shining from the lantern ~ Light should've been shining from the lantern ~ or at least a sliver of moonlight ~ Couldn't you tell the difference? ~ How'd you make such a mistake, girl? ~ What's so astonishing about my mistake? ~ Bro-in-law is as tall as my husband ~ I was tired out from the day's work ~ As soon as I lay down, I fell asleep ~ Forgive me, my lord, I made a mistake ~ The way we all imagined... ~ is not the way you behaved ~ Your face shines with innocence ~ You didn't do wrong last night! ~ Where are the weapons? Did the earth or sky swallow them? I want to know how the arms vanished from the truck? They cost over a crore! Who's responsible for this? The alcohol is responsible. They must've been drunk like rotten curs! You cheated us out of greed! If you think you'll make money off me... you won't hear the clink of that money! You'll hear the screams of death! Your death scream! I don't like anybody cheating me! Tell me where the arms vanished to or I'll draw the curtain of death on you both! The curtain of death! I want the arms! The weapons! We've never been so badly insulted until today. Yes, Shamsher! We'll come out clean from this degradation! But how? Whatever the truth, Karan and Arjun had a hand in it. We both saw them. Until we throw those two dogs at brother-in-law's feet... the truth won't surface nor will brother-in-law believe us. But how do we reach Karan and Arjun? There's one way. Mother! Mother! Hey! It's Usha's son. Usha... your son. Son! What happened to my child? Son. Get up! What happened? "If you don't send Karan and Arjun to the hill in an hour... we'll start sending the corpses of every child here. " I think Karan and Arjun didn't get our letter. We have to send another letter. Understand? Hey! Come here! Yes, you! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Run or I'll shoot! Help! See? Our hunters came here as our victims! I'll kill the scum! No. No! First we'll show them to brother-in-law and prove the villagers lied. - We're here. - Leave the children. Get up! Leave the children. Now we'll take you to brother-in-law. Come on, go! Why'd you stop? Garlands? They're the garlands we gave her to put on her sons' picture. These garlands will seal your fate today. They're flowers for your bier. Flowers for our bier? Old woman! I think we should read out your last rites... along with Karan and Arjun's. Shamsher, start the jeep! Run! What?! - Daddy! They're the same guns. - Thieves caught with the loot. They must've fought over the loot killed each other! Thakur Sir, you nurtured snakes! Snakes? Call them pythons! Someday they'd swallow the mansion too! They holed my boat! It's good the bastards died or they'd drown themselves and drag us down, too! - Who called the police? - I did. These weapons are worth millions and you called the police? Think about it. If Thakur's caught with the arms... the police would jail Thakur, his son and you. It was dangerous so I put the blame on these two. - Hello, sir! - Hello! It's good you informed us through your man. Your brothers-in-law traded illegal arms. Yes. I just heard about it. The scum killed each other for money and arms. Madam! The landlord is damned! This is killing two birds with one stone! Goods worth millions damned, and Nahar and Shamsher too... ...are damned! Let alone Nahar and Shamsher... even Durjan Singh won't be saved! - Bindiya! - Shut up! Bindiya, give me some grams. Put some more. Some more. - Hey, you! - Yes? Eating so many grams. Were you a horse in your previous birth? - What are you eating? - Biscuit. Were you a dog in your last birth? Eat grams! Eat biscuits. Nahar and Shamsher are no more. When will the rest who are left...? When will they be damned? Our hands are tied as long as Sonia is their prisoner. - Sonia? Who's Sonia? - Mom... - Your daughter-in-law. - Daughter-in-law? Yes, and Durjan wants to make her his daughter-in-law. No. Wedding bugles will never play in that mansion, only the Death March! khadagam chakra gadeshu chap parighan, shulam bushundim shirah shankham sanda dhatim kare strinayanam, saravanga bhushaptan ~ 'Hail, Mother Kali'... ~ Whether we have to take a life or give our lives ~ we will offer a sacrifice ~ Hail, Kali, destroyer of evil... ~ Hail, Mother Kali... ~ Whether we have to take a life or give our lives ~ we will offer a sacrifice ~ Hail, Kali, destroyer of evil... ~ Hail, Mother Kali... ~ When You are angry, the whole world trembles ~ When You are happy, the sun shines ~ Goddess of life, Goddess of floods ~ All is in your hands, o Mother! ~ Hail, Kali, destroyer of evil... ~ Jai maa kaali ~ Whether we have to take a life or give our lives ~ we will offer a sacrifice ~ Hail, Kali, destroyer of evil... ~ Jai maa kaali neelaashmadyuti maasya paadadashakaam seve maha kaalikaam yaamastaout svapite harou kamalajo hantum madhum kaitabham ~ Who in this whole world can dare ~ to lift their head against You? ~ The head will be cut off ~ of the one filled with arrogance! ~ Hail, Kali, destroyer of evil... ~ Jai maa kaali ~ Whether we have to take a life or give our lives ~ we will offer a sacrifice ~ Hail, Kali, destroyer of evil... ~ Jai maa kaali ~ Jai maa kaali pranata naam prasidyakam devi vaishwaata haarinim trailokyavasinim lokaanaam varada bhava ~ Jai kaali... ~ ~ Jai maa kaali Why do you look so scared?

The same fools who were in the temple, sir. The ones you thought to be Karan and Arjun are Ajay and Vijay. What nonsense, Madam! Ajay and Vijay, Karan and Arjun, makes 4 of them! A bier needs four shoulders! Be careful, sir! Our stars indeed seem inauspicious. Weapons worth millions were seized. Your brothers-in-law were killed. Now Ajay and Vijay. Always some problem or other. I want the marriage plans stopped for now. I'll return to the city with my daughter. Stop the marriage? Till yesterday, you were my business partner in profit and loss. But now we're related, you're a partner in joy and sorrow. The marriage won't be postponed. It will be held on the day we decided! - But... - If you become adamant... not you but your corpse will leave for the city! - Apologize? - Yes, dear. I'm ashamed of my deeds. I fixed your marriage in the wrong family. The man who can threaten to kill his friend... is capable of anything. That's why I can't bear to see you in this hellhole! Your Vijay has come here. Elope with him. Yes, my dear. I brought you up with great love. No, my child. Don't cry. I can't bear tears in your eyes. I'll plan how to help you run away from this house. Where are you running off to? Stop or I'll shoot! - But Daddy, you...? - Don't worry about me. Sonia!! Stop!! Run away! For my sake, run! Run, child! Brother Vijay! Some girl's screaming out 'Vijay'! Sonia, you're here? Daddy acquiesced to our love. He understood my life would be ruined with that man. Bodyguard? See that? People use goats to hunt tigers. I used my daughter. I thought nobody in this world was worse than me but you showed what a bastard you can be at the right time. I've become a slave to your lowness! I'll kill that scum in such a way... that God will end this system of rebirth! Go! Bring her to me! When Arjun has come, Karan will follow! Kill him! Where'd those two go? There! Follow them! - What happened? - Nobody's in the village. What?! - Nobody's in the village? - Yes, the village is empty. Have the villagers died? Did they die before witnessing the flames of my anger? You gave shelter to my enemies... I won't give you a place to be cremated! Your corpses will rot on the roads like stray dogs! Where have they all gone! Scum! Scoundrels! What is it? I'm alive only to see you being tortured like this. You played with blood! Today I'll watch... whose blood will flow and whose corpses will fall! How can you kill me? Death stands at your head! Thakur is damned! - Scum! - Shoot him! Catch them! Shut the gate! They're here! Let go! Catch. You scum! Hoodlum! How'd this happen? Suraj. Son! What happened, son? What happened, son? My son! Karan and Arjun killed my son! They killed my son! Those scum killed your son-in-law. They killed Sonia's husband! They extinguished the light of our family! Control yourself. Please sir. Control yourself. What are you doing? See, Saxena? I'm in my senses! There was no better way to nab my son's murderers! My son died because of you and now those two scum will die, thanks to you! Because of you! You! Those scum will die because of you! Quietly walk towards me. Don't act smart! Come! Old hag! Death is not at my head! Instead, I'm standing in front of them like Death! Please save me! Karan and Arjun will kill me! Forgive me. This is the garland you gave me. It's been piercing my heart like a thorn till today. Today I'll throw this same garland on your dead body and then I'll be at peace and your sins will be ended.
