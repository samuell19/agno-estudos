♪♪ The main event will feature former light heavyweight contender Danny "Boy" Jackson against the brash current champion Alonzo Medina. Boxing fans will remember Jackson as the champion that never was. He spent an unprecedented nine years in the world's elite top ten, but was never given a title shot and came to be known as the most popular non-champion in the history of the sport. Alonzo Medina, on the other hand, is young, brash, and exciting. He's defended his title seven times, with all wins coming by knockout. Jackson was reported Monday as saying he's a child with a child's talent and a child's mind. No love lost between these two fighters but the true love lies in the event itself. All proceeds will go to La Oportunidad, whose mission is to forge a new and improved alliance between the Hispanic community and otherwise to promulgate education, the development of vocational skills among whites, blacks, and Hispanics, and to furnish legal support and understanding to the families of immigrants who find themselves here illegally. Reginald Sterling and his nonprofit team at La Oportunidad has brought national attention to the plight of the immigrant through events such as these. I spoke to Mr. Sterling yesterday about this fundraising event and the organization in general. Well, Gina, we're just so proud to be here promoting this event. Raising countless dollars for a worthy cause. And both fighters have generously waived their salaries so they'll be fighting for honor alone. Honor for themselves and their competitive spirits, and of course our great cause here at La Oportunidad. ♪ I have walked ♪ ♪ These city streets alone ♪ ♪ I found no comfort ♪ ♪ Out here on my own ♪ So where are you from? We're from Dallas. Ooh. You here for the fight? I guess you could say that. You know I hear Medina is very, how you say, is sleek, but I hear also Danny Jackson used to be good, but now he's muy viejo, he's very old. Yeah he's getting up there. All right, Mr.Danson, Mr. Jackie Danson, welcome. Here you go. Numero doce. Number 12 on the end. - Thanks, um... - Sylvia. Sylvia. Maybe I'll see you at the fight. Probably will. ♪♪ That's it, work the jab. Hey, big guy, don't leave it in the gym. You're gonna need it for Medina. Yeah, that Freddy, got his big money, kid. Big money. Whoa, see that?

Oh, jeez, don't wish that on him. Can I talk to you for a minute? They gave me 20 grand for training expenses. I want you to put 10 of it on me. Danny, keep the money. You ain't gonna win this fight. Look, Fred, it's worth a gamble, okay? I'm an eight-to-one underdog. The bets only open for a knockout. Baby, if you're gonna bet, bet the other way. Bullshit, you know Medina can't knock me out. And I got the power. Danny, Danny, Danny, you're an old man in this game. Medina's young. Power only works if you can actually hit the other guy. I was against you from taking this fight, ese. Look, Freddy... I need the money, okay? I'm behind on child support payments, and they're gonna kick me out of my apartment. Dano, you made millions in the ring. What happened? You know, Freddy, time goes by and good things don't happen. Keep the money, Danny. All right, son, you did good. Made me proud. Hey, hey. We cool, hermano? Yes, yes, Freddy, of course we're cool. But you know I'm gonna kick his ass, right? Trust me, Danny, my fondest wish. - Dad? - Yeah? What are they doing? Oh, they're just showing their faith, son. What's faith? Faith is like believing with all your heart in something that you really can't see. So say some. Don't you believe, Danny Boy? Freddy, you know what I see? I see a woman whose country doesn't care about her. That's what I see. A woman who works maybe 12, 16 hours a day in constant fear of being deported. Probably doesn't even speak English and shares a house with three other families, in constant fear of how she's gonna feed her kids. That's what I see. So you tell me what faith has gotten her. Not much, but it's all she has. See you tomorrow morning, my man. Yeah. Let's go. Dad? Yeah. Why are we staying here? I thought you said they were putting us up at the Hilton? Oh, well, it's safer here. How? Well, even though they're billing this fight as an exhibition, bookies are still taking odds on a knockout. So whenever bookies are involved, well, things can happen. You mean they may try to hurt you? Well, they could put something in the water, something in the food, something to weaken me, anything is possible. Is that the reason you registered in a different name? Yeah, pretty good, huh? I went from Danny Jackson to Jackie Danson, yeah. Yeah, cool. Dad? Yeah? I should call Mom. Yeah, do you have any time left on your card? No. Okay, well, I think they're for sale in the office, you want to go get one. Okay. Just, you know, don't get sidetracked by any pretty senoritas. Very funny. Hey, you know what, I'll go. - Dad, I can go. - No, I should go. I mean, I don't want anybody getting to me through getting to you, you know what I mean? I can go.

I came back and he was gone. My God, tell me more, please. Yeah, it was that dude at the motel and his bitch wife, they took him, How do you know this? Because he left the cap off of his boot in my room. Well, not to sound racist or anything, but you know a lot of Mexicanos wear gold-capped boots, Mr. Jackson. About the boy, how old is he? He's 14. Well, my friend, you know how young boys are at that age. He probably just took a walk, stepped out for a while. No, not my boy. Well, how do you know that? Because I told him not to. With all due respect, Mr. Jackson, did you not ever disobey your father, especially at that age? Look, I left the room, I came back, it was trashed. My son is gone. Will you help me? Of course. Why don't you just go back to the motel? All right, relax. I'm sure he's back by now. And then if he's not, then you can file a missing person's report, all right?

I love you, boy. I love you too. You okay? It's okay. Look a little pale, eyes look a little funny and... And what? I'd go hungry first. What's the matter, Fraidy Cat? This is only a tiny little bird. Charges were brought... Are they ever gonna let us out of here. Shh, watch. ...kidnappings of Jamie Jackson and Tara Hastings. As well as charges of assault with intent to kill against Jackson's father, Danny Jackson, and Freddy Martinez. An investigation is also being launched into human trafficking allegations against Sterling and the involvement of his noted nonprofit organization, known as La Oportunidad, through which money was allegedly laundered. What are you up to? - What am I up to? - Gee, let's see. Probably the same thing that I was up to five minutes ago the last time you rolled in here. I want to get the heck out of here. Amen to that. Are they ever going to let us out of here? Remind me never to get shot again, okay? It's not the least bit pleasant, is it? No, there's about a billion other things I'd rather be doing right now. Hey, how's Jamie doing? Oh, he's good, thanks. Yeah, his mom picked him up yesterday. How was that? It was weird. It's like I think I'm gonna start seeing her again when I get home. Who knows, buddy? Did you find it? Find what? Faith. Man, if you can go through what the two of us went through and not find faith, you ain't human. Amen. What was that thing you told Jamie the other day? Faith is believing in something even when there's no reason to believe. It comes from up there and from right here. Speaking of believing, what in the world made you think you could beat Alonzo Medina? Oh, shut up. You know I could have taken that kid in three rounds max. They must have all kinds of drugs pumped into your system, man. I mean, you don't even know what you're saying. It is not the drugs, okay? It's a fact, I would have taken that kid. He's young, he's inexperienced, and I'm the seasoned professional. I read an article that said you were 41. I am 41. You're 46 if you're a day. That's close to 41. Oh, Lord, you're probably closer to 50. Nah. ♪♪ ♪♪
