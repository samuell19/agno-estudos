[couple kissing] Okay... I love you. I love you. [woman giggling] [man] I love you. [woman moaning] Sweetheart, close the door, this is Mommy and Steve's private time. Mommy? You heard your mother. Shut the door. Honey, listen to Steve, and shut the door. [screams] Bingo got caught in the mousetrap. [woman] Oh, my God. What happened? What happened? [♪♪♪] [man] Come here, boy. [woman] I'm just talking about a small renovation, nothing big. Just kitchen cabinets, maybe bring it into the 21st century, like the rest of the house. And how much is this small renovation gonna cost? I don't know, I haven't looked into it yet. Maybe 3,000, or something. 3,000? Oh, come on, Laura, you know it's gonna cost a lot more than 3,000. Listen, I'd love a new kitchen, too, but we're just not in a position to waste money right now. Jamie, are you being careful, honey? Well, one could argue that this boat is a big waste of money, something on it is always breaking. It's a big money sucker, that's what it is. Jamie, put the pocket knife down, and come over here, please. It's almost time to go. Stop being such a helicopter mom. He's too young to have it. Loosen up a bit. [cell phone rings] Oh, hang on a sec. Sorry, I... I just... I have to take this. Hang on. Hannah, hey, no, no, no, tell me everything. Yeah. Whoa! Hey... Ooh. Here you go. Thank you, Thanks. Oh, it's heavier than it looks. No problem. ...Yeah, that sounds great. Okay, well, call me in a bit. You're the best, thank you. Oh, can you hang on to this? I wanna read that when I get home. Oh. There's still no suspects? That's weird. So, how's Hannah? That was her, right? Don't do this again. She's my assistant. That's what she does, she calls. Your assistant who you ask to "tell me everything." [Jamie screams] - Oh, my God. - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! Jamie, look at me. Are you okay? You all right? Okay. Where does it hurt? My leg. He went under the dock. That could have gone south easily. Can he swim? Not really. [gasps] He cut his finger on that damn knife. It's just a scratch. Oh, baby... Thank you so much. Yeah. Docks aren't such a good place for kids to play. Yeah, I agree. Can you get up, buddy? Yeah, let's go. Come on. Come on... Thanks again. By the way, I'm Greg Halpern. Elliott. And you? I didn't catch your name. I'm Laura. Laura... And this is Jamie. Hi, Jamie. You gave us a scare, mister. Let's go get you dried off. Come on... All right, play ball. Charlie, don't hog it. Whoo! Okay, he is hot. And you're married. Yes, we're married, but we're still hot-blooded. Damn, look at that body. What I wouldn't do for a piece of that. Mm. Oh, come on, don't tell me you wouldn't do him. I wouldn't do him. Of course you wouldn't. Well, I sure as hell would. So, uh, what's his scoop? I don't know, I haven't talked to him much. All I know is he saved my son, and Greg just invited him for dinner. Who are we gossiping about now? Dammit, Bill, you scared me! Are you planning to come back in to finish making dinner, or is wine your new appetizer... Yeah, I'm coming. Good, 'cause I'm starving. Okay. Good. Hey, Laura. Hey, Bill. I hate it when he spies on me. Charlie, come on, it's time for dinner! [sighs] If only our husbands would be on that diet, and, you know, maybe exercise once in a while, they might have a chance of looking like that. Trust me, I'd be a much more attentive wife. All right, buddy, let's go! See ya, Mira. Oh, Hannah, you are a lifesaver. Okay, no, I really appreciate it. Yeah, yeah, you are the best. Okay, yeah, got it. This is stunning. Oh, thank you. You painted it? I did. Do you sell? I used to, when I had a studio, but Greg turned it into a work shed a few years ago. Oh. Well, that's a shame. Oh, you are the best. Thank you so much, beautiful. Okay, bye. That's just his assistant on the phone. Right. I hope you're hungry. Yeah. Little guy asleep? Out cold. Perfect. He's a really nice boy you guys got there. Thank you. He turned seven last month. Oh, no, no, not that one, honey. That's our anniversary bottle. Grab the merlot next to it. Our 10-year is coming up. Well, congratulations. Thank you. All right, I am starving. Let's dig in. Okay. Yeah. So, a contractor that sails. That is a combo I like. Oh, yeah? Sure. I'm always looking for other guys who sail. And a contractor... Oh, no, here we go. Laura wants to put in new cabinets, and give the kitchen a bit of a facelift, so to speak. And I keep telling Greg to stop resisting it, because it would be a really straightforward job. What do you think? You're right when you say it would be straightforward. It's when you start blowing out walls, that things become expensive. Elliot, buddy, you are not helping me out here, man. Sorry. I do actually have a free window right now for work. I could give you folks the friends and family rate. Seriously? Yeah. That'd be great. Why don't you run an estimate by Laura, and we'll go from there. Yeah. Here's to my new kitchen. Cabinets. Small job, small job. Tiny. [winces] How's that? It's, uh, it's fine. [wincing] Okay, okay. Honey? I don't think I'm into it tonight. Can we try tomorrow? [groans] Sorry. I understand. Okay, good night. [sighing] Good night. I am so freakin' jealous. I know, it's gonna be like a brand-new kitchen. No, not about your new kitchen. I'm talking about you spending the summer with Mr. Sexy. [chuckles] Oh. Okay, is he married? I don't think so. No ring. Huh. Girlfriend? No idea. I'm so gonna have to do him. Live out the whole suburban Mom's fantasy, if you know what I mean. Seriously, you've been watching way too many reruns of Sex In The City. Oh, come on, he is gonna be all sweaty, and, like, hammering stuff. I am just gonna have to show up unannounced, you know, casually, in my black negligée. You know, borrow a cup of sugar or something? Of course, you'll be M.I.A. You think you can do that for your dear, old, undersexed best friend? Mira, you are too much. [laughing] I'm getting all hot just thinking about it. Fro-yo? Yeah. All right, five more minutes, and then no more iPad for the day. Okay, Mom. Hey. Hi. Come have a seat. Okay. Wow... Yeah. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking, lose your pantry here, open this right up. Pull out your funky '70's decor at the top, and bring your cabinets higher to create more space. And then, right here, is where I think we could build you a brand-new island. You know, maybe put your stovetop on it, or your sink. This all looks amazing. Okay then. Oh, and don't worry, I will keep to the budget, but... you know, I thought you deserved a few extra perks. Thanks. Okay, I'm gonna go take a shower. [chuckling awkwardly] But I'll be back in a minute. - Okay. - Okay. [laughs] Hello? Very nice. What are you doing here? I've always wanted an all-white kitchen. Yeah. These are just some ideas I have as far as accents and shades. It's probably not great, but... No, no, no, your choices are perfect. Honestly, you have a real natural eye for design, Laura. Thank you. [chuckling] What's that? Ah. Close your eyes. My eyes? Mm-hmm. Come on, you can trust me. I promise I won't hurt you. Suck. Excuse me? Come on, fresh-squeezed and organic. Mm. Right? Yeah. Now... Close my eyes again? Please. Okay. [chuckles] Bite. Delicious, right? Melts in your mouth. That's good. Mm-hmm. Really, really good. [chuckling] It's Delizie, it's a bakery in the town over. It's one of my favorites. I thought you said you were from out of town. Well, I am, but, uh... my mom and I used to go there when we were in town. My uncle lives close by. Where does your mom live now? Does she still come to town? Uh, no... Are you close? Very, yeah. Um... She had unfaithful husbands, and... I was responsible to look out for her. So... Well, we should probably wrap this up and get back to your place. Yes. Yes, of course. Jamie's probably going to be home from his lesson soon. [♪♪♪] Hello! Hey! Elliott, right? Uh, yeah. Can I help you with something? Well, I don't know, maybe. I'm Mira. I'm Laura's friend? We met the other day in the backyard. I'm the neighbor. Right, right, right, right. Um... she's in the office. Oh, great. So, Elliott, where are you from? A little island close by. Try me. Danton. Get out of town. My sister lives there. Do you ever get back there? No. Really? Why not? It's so beautiful over there. There's nothing there for me anymore. Really? She's not grilling you with too many questions, is she? Oh, just getting to know each other. She's sizing up my hammer. Oh. You are on to me. Or so I wish. Just kidding. Um, so, do you have a girlfriend, Elliott? Are you taken, or so to speak? She's like that with everyone, I swear. Oh, come on, he's your contractor. I'm your best friend. Shouldn't we all just, you know, get to know each other? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, no. No girlfriend. Wow. You, no girlfriend? Come on. Well, I do have my eye on someone. Exciting. [chuckles] Well, she is a lucky girl. Bye, ladies. Really? [mouthing silently] You're too much. He is... wow. I know. Yeah, he said he had a late meeting with, um... Hannah? I think her name was. Yeah. His assistant. So you said. Yeah, I can't see any obvious damage, but I do think you might need a new one. Shoot. We just got those covers, too. I'm going to have to go in there and make sure that no one tried to break in. Yeah, yeah. Come get me when you're done? I'm just going to put my tools away. All right. [soft sobbing] Laura? Hey... [sniffles] Hey, what's wrong? Nothing, nothing, nothing. Let's just go. Come on. Wait, wait, it doesn't look like nothing. What's wrong, Laura? You can trust me. I have been so naive. I really should have known. I'm not following. I found these, here on the boat. And you think they're... [together] Hannah's. You see? You see it, too, right? He's having an affair with her, isn't he? I... I can't say. You just did. What are you doing, Laura? There's this dating site that she's on. It's called, um... Ah, shoot, I can't remember. It's, uh... "Hot, Young and Single"? That's it. Purple. Purple panties. It's all so friggin' disgusting! Hey, hey... Want to come onto my boat for a cup of tea? Yeah. Thanks, Mira. Okay. I'll be home for dinner. Thanks. Bye. Is Jamie okay? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. He's just gonna... have a play date for a little bit longer. I just need a little time to process this all. Yeah. Plus, he loves to have play dates with Mira's son. They're both only children, so... I was an only child, too. I always wanted to have a sibling. I always thought I would have more, but Greg doesn't want to. No? When we first met, he was on board, but somehow, our visions just changed. I guess it's all really changed now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I'm... I'm in shock. Listen... Do you believe that all things happen for a reason? When one door closes, another opens? I suppose I do. Me too. Greg is a cheater, and he has hurt you deeply, but you have to be bigger than him. You have to hover above his hurtful actions. You just need to close the door, and lock it, and then turn around and walk through what lays ahead of you. You are so beautiful, Laura. Thank you, Elliot. I should be going. Yeah. Yeah. Hey... Oh. It's cold out. Thank you. Yeah. Goodbye, Elliot. Oh... Goodbye, Laura. Mom... [sobbing] Where were you tonight? I was at work. With Hannah? No, I... I mean, we... we were working late. She's been so involved in this case, that I... I made her stay. You made her stay... I had her taking... notes. Right. Notes. Okay. Come here. Don't. Fine. Yeah, give it a good whack. Wow, that's great, honey. Just watch your finger. Elliott showed me how to do it. Where's Daddy? He left for work already. You're really great with kids. You want some of your own someday? Uh, I do. But you know, just... being a stepdad would do, too. Regardless of how I get kids, I'm a firm believer that family should be a man's everything. [text message chimes] Oh, honey, go change your shoes, Charlie and Mira are out front. You're gonna go to Science World with them today. Yes! Yeah... [chuckles fondly] Well, uh... I'm gonna go get cleaned up. I'll see you in a bit. Okay. [♪♪♪] Hey! This is a nice surprise. You look like a damsel in distress. You could say that. I think we need to talk. All right. Grab the bow. Help me bring her in. Thanks. [chuckles] Look at those two lovebirds, huh? Bring back memories? Me and you, that summer at Watson Lake? I think we christened every inch of that dock. They just came off Dirk Gersh's boat. Last week, Tony found them on his, and Colin just found a pink bra on their boat. It was an "A"-cup, so, clearly, not Barbara's. The kids these days, huh? Yeah, I found purple underwear on ours. What? Oh, you're kidding me. These damn teenagers. I thought somebody was on the boat. They left the flap open. Yeah... Teenagers, huh? Hey... So, what's up? Something's... clearly bothering you. It's nothing. Really. You sure? Yeah. I love you so much, honey. Go ahead. Oh, beauty. [chuckles] Hey, Elliot. Hey. Sweet pass. You and I should kick the ball around sometime. Oh, yeah, you play? I am very good at handling balls. Right, Laura? I wouldn't know. Bye, Mira. Okay, have fun. See you. Look, Mom! Elliott taught me how to pass. Oh, that's really great, honey. Yeah, you know, just a little male bonding. Aw. Hey, buddy... Does your dad ever play with you? Nah, it's not really his thing. Yeah, I guess he's just a little too busy with sailing and work, right? Probably doesn't make much time for you? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah... Well, you got me now, buddy, and I love to spend time with you, okay? You know what? Ta-dah. Shh, it's our little secret, okay? Okay. Well, you guys look like trouble. Elliott's the best, Mom! Oh, is he? Well, what can I say? The little guy has good taste. [Mira calls] Hey, Jamie! Yoo-hoo! You want to come over for a play date for a couple hours? Can I, Mom? Sure. Have fun. Come on, buddy. See you, buddy. Thanks for looking out for him. That's really not your job, I'm surprised Greg just left him here with you. Well, some fathers are different than others. Yeah. But Greg is a really good father. He's just sometimes preoccupied, that's all. Right. Listen, I need to talk to you about something. Oh, you do, do you? Yeah, it's... It's about this, actually. Then let's go talk. So... what is it that you wanted to talk about? I think we need to call this off. But why? We were just starting to get somewhere. I'm married. Well, you don't have to be. Greg is never even here, is he? Seems to me, he's either sailing, or at work. He doesn't respect you, Laura. He doesn't understand the treasure that he has. A woman like you deserves to be put up high on a pedestal, not at the bottom of a man's totem pole. Greg treats me well, he really does. I think I might have been wrong about Hannah. I just need to talk to him, and figure it out. This all just feels so... serendipitous, though, doesn't it? Jamie and I... You and I... It all just works. I don't know, Elliott, you're getting way... way ahead of yourself. Greg and I have our problems, sure, but I'm fairly certain that he is faithful. But now I'm the unfaithful one, and I'm just not that kind of person. I feel so awful. I can't even look at myself in the mirror. Kiss me...? No, no, no, we can't. We can't, we can't... But we can. [gasping] [whispering] Please, stop... Just leave it all to me, okay? Just leave it all to me. [gasping and moaning with pleasure] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Clarity. [car approaching] [text alert chimes] What are these? For you, my love. Happy Birthday. Please don't! And my birthday is tomorrow. Well, you were born overseas, weren't you? So technically, your birthday is today. How do you know where I was born? I know everything about you, my love. Honey? Oh, there you are. Thought you were still inside. Hey, man. Hey. Flowers? Yeah. Um, Elliott got them for me. For my birthday. Really? Mm-hmm. What a nice surprise. That's really thoughtful of you, man. And yellow roses? Your favorite. You're good. Okay, well, I have to get to work. And you and I have to plan that sail one of these days. Yeah. We sure do. I should get to work, too. I will see you inside, Laura. All right, man, I'll see you later. I should let you get those in some water. You are not going sailing with my husband. You're not going to do anything social with him, okay? You are not to accept any invitations of any kind. Listen... I just thought it would be nice. You know, so he doesn't start to suspect anything? I mean, if you're going to leave him, it needs to be done with ease. [laughs] What? I'm not leaving him, Elliott. I can't do this any longer. You can't do this any longer? You're a nice guy. But I'm married. I have a family. And I honestly thought that Greg was cheating on me, and I hooked up with you to spite him. And I'm really, really sorry. This is over. You... You can't... You can't work here for us anymore. You just... need to... go. [♪♪♪] Can I watch a show on the iPad? Sure. It's upstairs on the bedside table. Where's Elliott today, Mom? Honey, Elliott's not working for us anymore, okay? He isn't? No. No more Elliott. Why don't you go over there and watch your iPad, okay? [♪♪♪] Finally. Thank goodness. [♪♪♪] [doorbell rings] Jamie, can you get that? It's Doris, here to babysit. I'm so sorry I'm late. That's okay. I'm glad you could make it. So where are Bill and Greg? Oh, they went ahead to the restaurant already. I figured we could just drive ourselves. Oh, okay. Yeah. Surprise! [crowd] Surprise! [applause] - Happy birthday! - Thank you! Happy Birthday, my love. Thank you, my love. [Greg] Were you surprised? I was. We did it! Nice work, you. That was great. Happy birthday! Thank you. - Just one sec. - Yeah. Happy Birthday, Laura. Oh, thank you. Oh, my gosh, I can't tell you how excited Greg was about planning this party. We had secret planning meetings with Mira, like, the whole gang. Secret planning meetings? Mm-hmm. Greg had me late at the office three times this last week, planning this. I mean, he said you were all pissy about it, too. I was. She was. Reminds me why I never want to get married. You know? Don't be shy, don't be shy. Hannah, just the girl I was looking for. Hannah, this is Elliott. Elliott, this is Hannah. Hi. Nice to meet you. I've heard really good things about you from Greg. I've heard a lot about you, too, Hannah. Oh, he means how hard you work for Greg. [Greg] It's true. She is the best assistant in town. [Hannah] Thank you. [Greg] And he is a sailor, just like me. You sail? Yeah. [Hannah] Oh, my. I can tell. Are you all right, man? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm all right. Would you guys excuse me? I think I'm going to grab a drink. Actually, I could use a refill myself. Me too. You see that? Yeah. Elliott is not smooth with the ladies. I know. So... Do you, like, build houses? No. Oh, I thought you were renovating Greg and Laura's kitchen. Yeah. Yeah, I am. - Okay. See you guys. - Good to see you. Bye. Oh, Elliott. Elliott, hello? Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Great. Looks like you need a top-up? Yeah. I guess I do. Well, let's get you one, shall we? I would love that. Elliott. Elliott. Wait a minute. I love Laura, but this party is super lame. I was looking for an excuse to get out of here. Do you have one for me? I sure do. You didn't really say too much tonight. Come to think of it, you've been pretty quiet lately. You want to talk about it? Look, I... I know when something is wrong with you. I found these underwear on the boat... And I got it in my head that they were Hannah's, and, um... so I went to that website that she was on, and they looked the same... And I then made a big mistake. Like a really, really bad mistake... Okay, look, look, look, I'm gonna stop you right there, okay? Listen, I know that I haven't always been the best husband in the past... But I've been seeing you a lot clearer lately, and I... I'm sorry. I was such an ass about the renovation. You were totally right... it looks great, and I'm glad that we're doing it. You don't understand. I have to tell you... Don't beat yourself up about mistakes, okay? You... You're amazing. You're an amazing mom... an amazing wife, and I'm lucky as hell to have you. You look like you could use some rest. Yeah, I could. I love you. I love you, too, Laura. So much. [text alert chimes] [text alert chimes] So... Do you like it dirty, handsome? Rough. I like it. Come on. So... You're like... the strong and silent type? Oh, my God. You've got to be kidding me! Are you kidding me? You can't get it up? Wow. What the hell is this? Are you into Laura? You are, aren't you? At the party, you were kind of obsessed with her. You kept staring at her. Are you like a nutter or something? Only a nutter would be obsessed with Laura. [Hannah choking, Elliott grunting] [Hannah choking] Honey? I have to go. Okay. I love you. I love you, too. Oh, Jamie is playing with Charlie over at Mira and Bill's. Okay. I'll go over there soon. Listen, when this sailing trip is over, you and I have to go out, just the two of us, midnight cruise. Deal. That's my girl. - I love you. - Love you. - I'll see you later. - Bye. [♪♪♪] [Jamie screaming] Jamie! What happened? What happened? Were you on the ladder? Yeah. Are you hurt? No. No, I'm okay, Mom. I just slipped and it scared me. Jamie, you know you're not supposed to play with any of these things when Mommy's not here. Daddy said that you were at Charlie's. But Elliott was here, and I'm allowed up on the ladder when an adult is here. Where is Elliott? Where is Elliott? I don't know. Okay. Are you sure you're not hurt? No breaks? No breaks. Okay. Why don't you watch TV, okay? Okay, Mom. Okay. Elliott! In here. What are you doing? Just working, sweetheart. Finishing our new kitchen. Did you see the shed? I made your dream art studio, didn't I? I only want to make you happy, don't you see? Leave. Hey... come here. Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me. I want you to leave right now. Do you understand? What is wrong with you? I don't know what to say to you. I keep telling you we're done and you're not hearing me. You can't just break into my house. All of it... It's too much. My mom wants to meet you, and I thought maybe you, Jamie and I could all go as a family. Wouldn't that be nice? Okay, you just need to go. And, I mean, right now. You're so ungrateful, Laura! I am not interested in having you finishing the house. Or doing any surprises for me. I'm not comfortable in you coming to my home anymore. Do you understand? - No. - Let go of me. You and Greg are done, okay? He needs to understand that. I love Greg. I made a mistake. Marrying him... No! By being with you. Let go! I love you, Laura. Okay? You chose me... and now you're mine. You need to know I won't have it any other way. Shh. You need to go right now or I'm going to call the police to come and get you. Call the police? Call the cops? To come and get me? If you try to hurt me... Try to put me away... I will tell everybody everything. You'll tell everybody everything? Mm-hmm. Jamie. Jamie deserves to know... About you and I... Don't worry. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Greg should know, too. I'll tell him about us. About what you've done to me... He'll understand... Because he knows... that you were meant to be with me. Just me. Don't touch me! Let go of me! You're hurting me! You're hurting me... What are you doing to my mom? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart. It was just a misunderstanding. Everything is going to be all right. [car engine starts] Come on. Let's go back inside. [tires screech] "Needed some direction. Recommended. Did a wonderful job." What? "Do not hire. Will destroy your life. Dangerous." [ship's horn blows] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Laura dings desk bell] Can I help you? Oh, sorry. I didn't know you worked here. For 37 years. I have an odd question. I always did like me odd questions. Shoot. I'm looking for someone who used your Internet here. You got a name? Not really. Lots of people use my Internet. No service up the hill, so lucky for me, I'm the nearest one to the marina. But you don't got a name, I can't help ya, Lady. "Purple Wallflower?" Does that mean anything to you? "Purple Wallflower?" The only "wallflower" I know is Winnie Hamel. And she does come in here pretty much every morning. Do you know where I could find her? Up the road, near Grimsley Street. Blue-ish house, high hedge. Thank you. Now, don't tell her I called her a wallflower, you hear? Oh, I won't. Thanks. [♪♪♪] [knocks on door] Hi. May I help you? I was looking for Winnie Hamel. Why? Are you Winnie? I'm Laura. I came from the mainland. What do you want? Well, this might sound odd, but are you "Purple Wallflower"? Did you write something on the Internet about a contractor named Elliott? I have to go. Oh, please, no. I... I just really need to know... No. I don't want any more trouble. Please, leave me alone. What did he do to you? Please. I really, really need to know. I almost lost everything because of him. My marriage, and family. He's crazy. [man] Who's there, Winnie? Look, I can't talk about it, but just look into what he did to his own mother. Okay? That's all you need to know. His own mother? What do you mean by that? Elliott is... [man] Did you just say Elliott? Please, leave me alone! [♪♪♪] Crap! Come on. [screams] [man] Oh, my God. Call 911. Oh, my God. A mid-20s female has been found murdered in the local marina. Our sources have confirmed that police are calling it a homicide. A police spokesman said it is believed to be Hannah Jopkins of Makins... - Holy crap! - Isn't that...? Yeah, that's Greg's assistant! That's her name. She was at the party we threw for Laura. No, no, no, I'll take care of it. Yeah. Yeah, I know the guy at the club there. No, I booked the tee time for 3:30 Thursday. I wonder if Greg knows. We should probably call him, huh? Give me your phone. I'll call him now. Yeah, I guess if you're coming from your office... Oh. Hang on one sec. Look, Bill's calling on the other line. Yeah. Okay, sure, well, we'll meet there at 2:15 Thursday. Okay, great, man. [Greg moaning] [door slams] [line ringing] [TV report continues] No answer. Hello? [glass shatters, Laura gasps] [glass shatters, Laura gasps] Greg? Are you home? [thud] [gasps] [♪♪♪] [crunch, gasp] Ahh! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [gasps] [groans] Ohh! [grunting intensely] [panting] What the hell? [grunts] She's mine! [panting] Oh! Ah! She's mine! She's mine! Ahh! I won't ever let you take her away from me again! [Laura] The police were just at the house. Sometimes, Greg just takes off and goes sailing. That's bizarre. I'm worried. Greg would've said something. Have you gotten a hold of him yet? No. He's probably sailing through a dead zone or something. So they don't have any leads, huh? No, they say they don't, but I mean, the cops are gonna have to talk to Greg at some point, get some insight, right? Find out if she was dating somebody. You know, at the party, she did say she was gonna go and hook up with somebody from one of those dating sites. Tsk. I don't know. - It's just unbelievable. - Yeah. Honey? You doing okay? Hey, so what did you want to talk to me about? You said you had something important, before we got into all the Hannah stuff. Mm. I should've told you this a long time ago, and I didn't. Okay, would you just tell me? You're killing me. I had an affair with Elliott. I'm sorry. You what? Don't make me say it again. Holy crap! "Had"? Like, past-tense? Happened twice. It's done. Greg doesn't know. [exhales] I know I'm to blame for getting involved with him in the first place, but after it happened the first time, I knew it was a big mistake, because... he got aggressive with me... like, really weird and obsessive. Like saying he's my husband, and knowing facts about me, like he's been researching me. Okay, that's... very weird. Yeah, and what's even weirder is that I met this woman who's, like, completely terrified of him. She said he ruined her life. - Hi, Mom! - Hi, honey. She was blogging about Elliott and she's from Danton Island. Wait. Danton Island? That's where he's from. He told me that. Yeah, I know. It's like he's threatening me. Okay, honey, you have to be careful with this guy. You have to be really, really careful. [sighing] Oh, man. [♪♪♪] Hi. Can I help you? Yes. I'll have a... camomile tea. Sure thing. First time here? Yes. It is. How did you guess? Well, people don't come here for the tea, they come for my baking. Would you like a cannoli? Maybe a muffin. Okay. Cranberry-orange? [♪♪♪] It's my history wall. Do you know him? Elliott? Oh, sure. He used to come in with his mother when he was a little boy. It's too bad she didn't have an easier time with him. A very peculiar child. Peculiar how? Well, if you must know, Elliott's father left Stella before he was even born, so she remarried when he was quite young, to give him a father figure, you know? Just so he'd have a normal life. But... normal was not in their cards. Always a new mess she was getting him out of. And he was very protective of his mother, and very involved with her personally, you know, right up until the end. The end? House fire on Danton Island. Are you talking about that house fire that's been in the papers? The unsolved one? Yep. See, Stella remarried... this lovely man... and they built this beautiful house on Danton Island, and the next I hear, she and her husband are both dead in a house fire. Oh, my God. Such a shame. I mean, Elliott never had a chance to make up with his mother. Everything seemed to be fine. I mean, he got a job working on a house somewhere... and then the trouble started. He got fired from his job, Stella had to look after him again, but her new husband, I mean... he didn't like... well. What grown man likes another grown man in his home? You know what? I actually have to go. I'm sorry. I, um... Thank you so much. I'll come back another time. Thank you. You haven't seen him recently, have you? Well, yes. You see, that's the thing. He's been coming in a lot recently. Just last night even... Came to get a cannoli for his fiancée. His fiancée? Yes! Says he's getting married. To a widowed artist... lovely lady who lives just one town over. He also said he's getting a new stepson. I mean, to be honest, he looked really, really good. I mean, not like he was after his mother's passing. Oh... Perhaps I've said too much. Mira... I'm on my way to pick up Jamie right now, but if you see Elliott near the house, can you just call me right away? Or better yet, call the police. [mutters] [dialing] Hi. You've reached Greg Halpern. I'm sorry I missed your call. I'll get right back to you. [beep] Greg... I love you. I love you so much. If you get this, can you please, please, just call me back. Oh, thank goodness. Daddy's home. And it smells like he made dinner. It sure does! Why don't you go upstairs and wash your hands? Honey! Honey? Honey, why didn't you call me? I was so worried. You should've called me. What... Why... Listen. I know we've had some miscommunication, and I really want to apologize. Do you want some wine? It's aged well. It's our anniversary bottle. Here. I want you to leave. [grunts] Laura... You... are the most precious thing in the entire world to me. Okay? I dream about you day and night. So why are you so... mad? I thought you'd be happy. What should I be happy about? Where's Greg? I took care of them. You took care of... "them"? [breath catches] Who did you take care of? Where's Greg? It's always about Greg! Are you hungry? [glass shatters] [pounds counter] Mommy? Stay up there! Don't you come down here! Where is he? [roaring] Stop talking about Greg! Where is he? No. You're just like her, aren't you? [inhales intensely] Are you talking about your mother? Am I just like your mother? What happened to her? What did you do to her? Don't you talk about my mother! She died in a house fire. And how did that fire start? How did it start? I think it's time I teach you a lesson, Laura. You don't want to treat me with the same love and respect that I treat you with, you need to be taught a lesson. - No. - Don't you think? No. Please, no. I mean, are you seriously gonna pick him over me? No. I won't allow you to do that again. I have done way too much for you already. [Jamie] Mommy? Go to your room, Jamie! He wet his pants. I need to change them. He's scared. Are you hungry, buddy? Why don't you come for a nice meal, okay? [Elliot grunts and Laura gasps] Seems your mother needs some discipline, Jame-o. Let's go. Let's go. Walk! Get up! Come on, Jamie! Mom needs some discipline! [♪♪♪] Have you learned your lesson, yet? [sighs wearily] I have. I have, I swear. I don't want to hurt you, Laura. I don't want to hurt you, Laura... But you keep turning me away. Disrespecting us... what we have. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I want us to be a family... for you to be my husband... for you and me to be a couple. A couple? You can trust me. I love you. I see that now. Do you remember the blanket that you covered me with? [chuckles] I kept it. I wanted to have it near me so I could always feel you. You're always so romantic, Elliot. You're just always so kind... That's because I'm a good husband and partner. Not like those other men. Exactly. You know how to treat a woman. I do. Please... untie me. I love you. I love you, too. Where is Jamie? Mommy! Oh, my God! It's okay, honey. It's okay. Everything's gonna be all right. See what I'm talking about? He still hasn't finished his dinner. Jamie, honey? Why don't we do what Elliott asks? Go ahead and eat. [♪♪♪] You see? He's a good boy. He's a real good boy. Wine? [♪♪♪] Sure. Yeah, sure. That would be great. [♪♪♪] Do they see you, Mom? Wave, Mom. Wave! Get away from the window! Move! I was just looking. I said, get away from the window, now! Come on. Upstairs. Let's all go upstairs. Come on. Everyone upstairs. Now. Let go of him! Go. Go! Go! [♪♪♪] Hey. Come on, buddy. What are you doing with him? Come on. - Come with me, okay? - What are you doing? Come on. Mommy and Daddy need some privacy. [♪♪♪] You're gonna spend a little bit of time in here, okay? There you go. [door latches] [♪♪♪] Hey. Come here. [belt buckle clinks] Hey. Hey! Hey-hey-hey! Oh! Shh. Shh! Shh. What's the matter? You don't want me anymore? [quiet gasp] [voice trembling] No. No, I want you. Yeah. [sniffs deeply] Yeah, okay. [buckle clinking] [zipper unzips] [♪♪♪] Mommy? [door creaks] [gasps] Oh... oh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. Mommy's all right. [♪♪♪] Mommy? Mommy's fine. [Stella] Sweetheart, close the door. This is Mommy and Steve's private time. [♪♪♪] [yelps] [♪♪♪] No. Come on! Let's go! Okay. Sit down. Listen to me. I want you to run over to Mira and Bill's, okay? Okay... Run over to Mira and Bill's, and tell them we need help. Okay? You got that? Gonna be okay? It's gonna be all right. Just remember, keep running, okay? Just keep running. Run! Run! Run! Run! [gasps] No. No! Run! [choking] [grunts] [thud] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [click] [ripping] [♪♪♪] Laura! [gasps] [♪♪♪] Greg? Greg? Greg, are you in here? Oh, my God! Greg! Greg! Greg, do you hear me? Greg! [gasps] Oh, my God. Honey... [groaning] No, no... Are you okay? Come on. Come on, we need to get you out of here. There you go. Okay. [cries out] What is it? My leg. I think it's broken. I... I can't walk. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna go get help, okay? Okay. Be careful. Okay. Okay. Mayday. Mayday! [thunder rolls] This is Laura Halpern. Coast Guard, do you read? Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay. Shh, shh... [♪♪♪] [gasping] Laura. [♪♪♪] [gasps] [crack] [♪♪♪] [Elliott] Honey! Come back here! Laura! Laura! Ah! Come here! [whack] Ahh! Laura... [chuckling] Come here. [roars] Come here! [grunting] Don't you understand? You're mine. [grunts in disgust] No. No? No... means "no." [grunts] Ahh! [body thuds] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Nice one! Try again? All right. - Hey. - [gasps] Oh! I see you found my treat. Your treat? Yeah. I met this really nice lady down at the marina, and she turned me onto this fantastic bakery, and they... oh! They make the best cannoli. Now, I know I'm on a diet, but sometimes... you just gotta cheat. Mm! [jars rattle] [♪♪♪]
