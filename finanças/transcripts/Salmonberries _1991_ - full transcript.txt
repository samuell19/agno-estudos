Butch, you know where the A is, so find it yourself. The Books get better the more you read them. Actually, that's not quite right, The good books, they get better and better, And the bad ones... - Butch! Yes. And the bad ones don't get worse. They just stay put. - Check them out and then buzz off! You are an angel, Roswitha. If I wasn't reading so much... - Bye. I don't know what would become of me. - Goodbye, Butch. Have a nice evening.

You're welcome .. my pleasure. You don't talk very much, I guess. You're an Inupiat, or what? Russian. - Oh. what's your name? - Kotzebue. Your name is Kotzebue? My people discovered this place. Your people? OK. Now listen to me: Kotzebue, that is a German name. I myself... I hate your kind of jokes, boy. Who shows no respect for books, normally has no... This time you won't get far. This time the sherriff will come then the handcuffs will say 'click', And the books will be safe again from you and your kind, young man. What next? Hey. It's pretty dark in here. Maybe I do read too much at night. I .. I just thought I saw .. a naked woman. - Hello. - Hello, Butch. My little nephews! - Hello Dad! Hey you old book worm Honey, my dear! My beautiful educated princess of the world of books. I forgot my toilet brush. - Toilet brush! Ah I see that your admirer is still here. Did you both have fun throwing books again? I hated your spying on other people. Turn it off. Just turn it off. Do you have your period, or what? - No. - Well you're getting it. I fixed it... What the hell are you doing here? Are you out of your mind? How much longer is this to go on? This is absolute terror. It must be Christmas.. The young man is bringing presents. Do we need help? Should I go and get someone? No. I'll be able to handle this myself. So, what is it with this rubbish? He was Russian, fine, OK. Then you know it all, I'm happy for you Anything else? - You know more. Tell me. They were Russians, that's all. - You're lying! Me? You say that I lie? And you, you lie to me and say that your name is like the town. You come in here, and throw books .. You do a strip tease, .. the public sign. Your name is Kotzebue? You shall have your story: Otto von Kotzebue, who discovered this area here, was the third of the 17 children of the successful German playwright August von Kotzebue, who in the year 1819 was stabbed to death by a student of theology called Sand. Sand. He was sentenced to death and decapitated by sword in public. The Kotzebues lived part of of the time in Rewall, Estonia, So some of their children were born as Russians. Four of the sons are to be found in the dictionary. One was a writer, another a high rank officer, another an explorer and one was a battle painter supposedly the painter went mad and jumped through his last painting. The girls were not mentioned. That's it. Noayak! I think we will help Kotzebue to carry that sign out of here. Now. Alright folks we're in the middle of the game, we're down to the wire. Here we go.. B-4. Be good. I-16. Not me anymore. next one.. I-20. It will get you plenty. Slower, Chuck. I'm trying to slow down. O-63. Oh look at me. - Bingo! Congratulations Bill: the devil always shits in the biggest pile. All right folks, let's keep playing. Let's rock 'n roll. Game number twelve. Oh Lord, what a friend we have in Jesus! Stay with it, honey, stay with it. The game goes on. A-13. Again thirteen. And 31. Nice number! Oh - 65. Book worm! Book worm! Toilet brush! Toilet brush! Cheater, I want my money back! Move. Then I will have to get the police. Hey.. This is... With this they ... - Found you? Yes. As a new born baby? Yes. Where? Nobody knows. But not here... No. Somewhere in the wilderness Yes. The Eskimos used to do that with the extra girls. But they let them freeze. They didn't put them in a cardboard box with a destination. And now you want to know. - Yes. - Who your father was... - Yes. - And your mother? - Yes, and... - And who you are. You know, I had fellow students in Germany who were found somewhere, on the road side, in shoe boxes, at the end of the war. They too didn't know who are. You're not the only one. Who gave you that sign? The other one. Your foster mother? Yes. And they called you that way because that's what the sign said. Yes. Yes. So that is your story And now you come here and think that if you terrorise me I can help you out. But I can't help you. And above all, not this way. Even if I wanted to. The old story about the German or the Russian discoverer, have absolutely nothing to do with your heritage. And now let me through - I'm cold. For you. That's what I suspected. - How much do you want for it? - Nothing. Want some coffee? - No. - Tea? Tell me. I already told you, there is nothing. - Tell me about you. - I don't talk about myself. Tell me anyway. I'm going to put on something else warm. I mean, do you want some berries? No. I will get some anyway. Where do you work? Coyote mine. Four weeks shovellin' and two weeks off, because of the lead. The lead will still get into your blood. But I thought that only young men worked there? Well I told the foreman that if someone came too close I'd cut his dick off. Oh - I forgot the berries. I like to collect berries. There's tons of them! In patterns. Well, I have a little screw loose too.. On vacation my husband and I .. always went to pick berries. When I came here it continued. A summer without berries is no summer for me At the beginning I thought that I could give away many of them, but people came to call with their presents and I had to talk to them, but I wanted to be alone with my images. That's how it is and has been for 21 years. It's good. When I can them I write the year on the bottom. Sometimes, I make new patterns. in the long nights, When the light returns in February, everything starts to glow again. You must be... you're... Are you pissed or nuts, or what? Wow, she's sleeping! Good. She's asleep. Jesus! Smells like... liqueur! - It's strong. - You are better? I'm fine. Please don't drive with that thing, I mean with the machine. No, no, the door is over there. Is anyone home? I just wanted to come by to chat a little. Kotzebue brought by a fish. You can have half. Call me Kotz. - Yes, however you like. Wait wait. Put it behind. Are you OK? - Yes. Put it behind. - I'm fine. Hello Roswitha! Hey you punk, help that lady. Sit here and put that behind. When the sun goes down and night falls, the cloak of winter leave everything in the dark. You seek refuge to calm the storm, shaking as an instinct just to stay warm. I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. You hear the howling of the dogs and the wind, stirring up the secrets which are frozen within. The ice will haunt you, it lays so deep, locking up inside you the dreams that you keep But I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. Tell me. Kotz, you won't find anything. It doesn't have anything to do with you. Tell me about your husband. I don't know... He.. he was... He was what? A Musician. Rock? He was a violinist. The last thing he played was the Spring Sonata by Beethoven. - Where is he? - He's dead. How old was he? Twenty-four, just like me at that time. 21 years ago they shot him. Who? Germans. - But you're... - German, ja. We were both German, me and my husband. OK then, so you will be the one.. I don't know why it is you that I tell everything. My parents were Communists. My father died in a camp just before the end of the war. I never knew him. My brother and I, we grew up in Berlin. My mother was very weak, but so happy we were in the East when Germany was divided. For the Communists, who wanted to realise my father's ideals: that all people are equal. But then they built the Wall. They locked us in. We couldn't say what we thought couldnt write what was in our hearts. We couldn't do what we thought was right and fair. Like with the Nazis, my mother used to say. She died. I married when I was 21 Karl and I decided to escape. It was on a March night. We had bought an escape route. Went underground from a house from East Berlin directly to theWest and it ended up directly behind the Wall. We were almost through, We were running, both with suitcases, backpacks, he with the violin case. And then the spotlight, the voice over a loudspeaker said: Stop, it's an order! And then the gunshots. Karl runs, falls over the violin case. Shots. I turned around, wanted to help him. Shots. He yells: Run, Roswitha, for God's sake run! run! I stood there. I couldn't move. I see his blood, a pool around him gets bigger and bigger. He told me: Please run! I ran. I ran. Far... That's how I came here. I've never left this place again. But I always see that spot that gets bigger and bigger. My sneakers are wet. OMG! It wouldn't start. My God, what is this? It wouldnt start! AND? I was just trying to fix it. You blew it up? - No. I didn't blow it up. You just blew it up? No, I was just trying to fix it. That's all you Young people know. What you learn from television. You blow up good things! - I did not want to do it. Try and try and try. - Has been inadvertently. I really regret telling my story to a rascal like you... I was just trying to fix it. ... You have no respect for anyone, nor of books, not of feelings, not of yourself. Hey - wait wait! You won't make it this way, barefoot. Let's go! When the sun goes down here and darkness falls the blanket of winter leaves no light at all. The ice will haunt you, it lays deep locking up inside you the dreams that you keep. But I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. This wind through my soul blows cold. Kotz! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Don't you dare! Go away! Leave me! Leave me! Come join us, Witha. Base 42. Base 42. Can you hear me? Let's go out right now. Are you there, Base 42? - We are about to. Lucas, do you hear me or not? Yes, I receive you. Son, are you there? It'll still take a while. Are you going to bring that tat right now? Who else is with you? Are Pete or Selma? -I'm dying of laughter. This is Nancy. How funny is that And.. that's Kotz, a friend of mine who crashes here. Nancy, come. It wasn't yesterday... That you told me we were going to Florida. But you said going to finish your Masters here. It wasn't yesterday. It was 19 years ago, I was 15. Well the money's here now. All you gotta do Say the word.. I will tell you one last time, bring home the sat gun right now, Where are you? After half a century of painful separation has come down The German Parliament, the Reichstag, is once again a symbol of democracy. Celebrationss have been held all over the country, but the most spectacular it was the one in Berlin. Berlin, Berlin. More than a million people crowded around the Brandenburg gate they watched as fireworks lit up the sky. It was 11 months ago that the wall was breached and unity of two ations has arrived quickly. .. of a new Federal Republic of Germany. - Where are you going? - Berlin. You don't want to leave this place, you don't want to go to Florida. You wanna sit at your window and spy on people. Reporting a rain shower .. just 48 degrees Father. More rain is expected. The sky is cloudy. The average temperature is 39 degrees If it keeps going down... Where are you? Answer, where are you? Now listen kid. All I have to do is call the sheriff. Besides that, I know your... Where did you get those? I'll cut your dick off. I can't forbid you to come here, it's a public library, but don't expect any favors. What's all this about? - Open it. - Open it. A plane ticket. -Where to? Berlin. Two Round trips. Kotzebue-Berlin-Kotzebue. You are crazy. Maybe I should think of a new name for you Yes, Switha. - What? -What what? Did you call me sweetheart ? No. Switha .. like Witha. But I think Switha sounds sweeter. Sorry. Thank you. You started. What? With the names. - You know? Kotz doesn't sound good in German. - Why? What does it mean? Your key. It's isnt really important. Then find me a new one Switha. - What? -Name. I'll think about it. You promise it. - Oh! My blouse! - Sorry. Don't you have a brother here? Aren't we going to visit him? Switha, what happened? Are you OK? I never finished telling you my story. My brother, I think my brother was the only one that could have given away our escape route. Does he know you're here? - No. Does he know where you live? - No. Does he know you're still alive? No. Do you know where he lives? No. Oh. We'll find out. I think I don't want to see it. Why are you here? This has nothing to do with you. But with you. How does that help you? I was alone. Now I have a friend; I can tell you everything. And ask you anything. Switha, where was it? It was here, I think. The house must have been here. Everything was so well thought out. Everything. It seemed so safe. I guess they blew it up after they caught us and then filled up the tunnel. Show me the path, Switha. Show me everything. Up the hill was the tunnel, I think. My memories are terribly precise but the reality is so different. Up here there were mines everywhere and watch towers. It was a prison. Why? Because the idea of the equality of everyone was misused by a few. Here... It must have been here. - Are you sure? - No. Switha, look around yourself - it's gone. The towers, and the wire, the mines, the wall... They are gone. I'm cold. - Now you want to know? - Yes. Where was he taken after -Yes. Maybe your brother knows.. - Yes. Roswitha. Good morning, Albert. This is Kotzebue. Roswitha, you are finally here! So, you are Roswitha. It was time for me to finally we met. Pass. Sorry, Who is this with whom I have pleasure? I have something in the oven. Excuse me. I don't ask you for any explanation for what you did, Albert. Young man, can you give me a hand? It's been a long time, but to me it's like yesterday I know you wanted us to stay you believed in this regime, your career in the Party. Cranberries You didn't want to lose your only sister. Also, Karl was your friend. Albert, What did they do with him? Where was he taken afterwards? Albert. Albert. Roswitha! You must say something. Roswitha, Albert doesn't hear anything. He is deaf. He is deaf... He doesn't have to hear you, he understands. So sorry. Yes, Albert. I knew that The whole time. Mother's jewelry. Thank you. Good-bye. Roswitha, you really must come, It is almost ready. But this is... Roswitha, you can't go like this. Switha, you look so beautiful. Where did you get that? Where did you get those? Chuck asked me the same thing. In the same way. Bingo Chuck, my ex Chuck? Noayak's husband? Do you know that Noayak has the exact same charms. Mine were in the package. - The one they found you in? Yeah. This... How far is it to the graveyard? Not far. It will still be light out. Berlin, GDR, November 12 1970. Dear sister: The tragic event of day 7 has overshadowed my life. I don't know where you have fled, or where you plan to flee. However I would like, in the event that I find out your whereabouts, to notify you that we have with great risk, on the 11th of this month, been able to give your husband and my friend, Karl, a proper funeral. He is buried in section 11-A, plot 524 in the Prenzlauerberg cemetery. At the commemoration, two of his colleagues played the Spring Sonata no. 5 by Ludwig von Beethoven. After the funeral we invited his friends at the Gr?ne Linde. I find it necessary to tell you that I believe I have done my duty in reporting the two of you. And I bear you no grudge. With socialist greeting. Your loving brother Albert. How are you doing? All right. - Go figure. - Yes, of course. My husband just shows up at night. I don't know if I will have time. It needs to be thrown away. I will not eat this. This is not bad at all. Hey! Hey I understand you. I am Eskimo. I am Eskimo. I am Eskimo. I am also an Eskimo. We are all Eskimos! This boy is not well. Can you undo this for me? I'm glad you said something. I said nothing. I wanted to say it, but I couldn't. It was enough. - Enough? No it wasn't. So much more, everything I feel and see, at home and from my past. How can I learn? To say it? To express it? To speak? Yes. Could you teach me? Can I honestly teach you anything, Bubu? You thought of a name for me. I think I like it. Can I hear it one more time? You've given me a very great gift today, Bubu: The bad images are vanishing, You're smiling for the first time. Yes, Bubu, I could give it a try. Now, my journey is over. Now we could start to look for the German Kotzebues. That's not going to do me any good, Has nothing to do with me. Bubu, I'm sorry, you have helped me so much And I am so thankful for that. Switha, I do not know where I was without you. You smell so wonderful. You're so Beautiful. So beautiful. So tender. You're an angel. I was nothing I was in the dark. Switha, you're bright. I love you I love you so much, Switha, I want to die for you. Switha, I want to die with you. Switha. Switha, I want to be... Enough! We have to stop now, please. Bubu, I am not so. You are not like that. We both have .. to be very careful, one with the other. You see, it's like you're just pulled that sledge from our city all the way up to my brother's house, to the grave. I really want to tell you how close I am to you; please give me some time My heart is so very upset I feel so ripped. I imagine what there would be afterwards. You want more and I would have had to tell you the same thing, And this is not me. And after the fact? What would happen then? I do love you though. You came into the library and didn't have the slightest hope to find anything, you just started to search and you opened one door after the other for both of us, You and I. Bubu, have you ever loved someone, in a physical sense, like you wanted me Man and woman? Look, I'm very unsure but I have to be honest: I think the two of us have something waiting for us, something important. We cannot jeopardize it. I think of Alaska, it's my home now even more. You are for me the most important in the entire world. Without you... Say something, Bubu. Please. I can't stay with you. Noayak, I have nothing to read. The library is closed, I don't have anything for tonight. Where is Noayak? Are you returning my money, young fella? I got them. She's got them. I have to go to bingo. Bingo waits here now, she does not. What do you mean she ? - She's a girl. Oh. I did not give 'em to her Chuck, what's going on? The place is packed and.. People are about to tear it apart. You either lock the place up, or come down. It won't work this way Chuck They are very nervous. Is everything okay, Chuck? Yes, Ernie. Go calm them down, will you? Okay, hurry up. Chuck, I want to know who you gave the second tat to, where it was and when it was. I can't tell you, Noayak. Chuck, I'll give you one last chance. After that, those won't belong to you again. You know what I mean. Noayak, I think we have to tell Chuck that those were in the package with the baby which was found somewhere in the country 20 years ago. She is looking for father and mother, she wants to know who she is. It's her right. I cannot help you. Why? Because I am not proud of it. Then trash your pride! It wasn't just these two. I told you, I'm not proud of it. I gave them to every one of the girls. What do you mean by everyone, Chuck? Noayak, you know who I was. They called me Kotzebue because I started my tours from here. I did business with... very good trade was sealed .. with a.. A celebration, you don't just turn down these gifts of hospitality... they were all very young. Eskimos are... I know what Eskimos are. I wanted to tell you. And the girls. Yes, I take it that they were all very young. Just like me. I was 15 Now I'm 35. Maybe her mother was 15 too. On your last tour, the one with the big snowstorm, When you appeared out of nowhere in your big fur coat. Leave me alone with my daughter. This wind through my soul blows cold. I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. When the sun goes down here and darkness falls the blanket of winter leaves no light at all. You search for shelter to calm the storm, shaking with an instinct just to stay warm. But I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. You hear the howling of dogs and wind, stirring up the secrets that are frozen inside. The Ice will haunt you, it lay so deep, locking up inside you the dreams that you keep But I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. This wind through my soul blows cold. I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot. I'd walk through the snow barefoot if you'd open up your door. I'd walk through the snow barefoot...
