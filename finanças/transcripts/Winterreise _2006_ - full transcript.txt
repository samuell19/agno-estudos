WINTER JOURNEY I don't dream about him anymore. I dream about the blind black man who waits for him up there. And I know he'll leave one day, in search of the old man. For our fathers This isn't a Schubert mass, it's a snail's mass! Play it yourself, then! - Off we go to the sleeping organist! Hi, Huber! Asshole! Hi, Jacky! Franzi! Hi! - How's it going? My name's 'Gertraud' in here! - Oh, sorry. I suspected that. I'll see you later anyway, right? - Yes, later... Gertraud. Bye. Christ almighty! Damnation! Assholes! My name's Brenninger... Your machine just swallowed my cash card. That's robbery. To be precise, bank robbery! I've banked here for 30 years! Please do something, and make it quick. Can you read yet, Aishe? PLEASE WAIT HERE Sorted it out, princess? You'll need to talk to Mr Mankewski. But you won't need to queue up again. Holger! Look here! I don't mean to offend, 'cause I know you went to school with Xaver... But if I go over the road to the Dresdner Bank, they'd be happy to take me. A private account, a business account and a house. Got it? Franz, you've exceeded your overdraft. - Yes, 'cause those assholes haven't paid! Schuster has owed me 20,000 for 4 months! That's a huge steel firm in Bochum. But if I send the debt collector, they'll buy somewhere else. You know that, right? Franz, this is a no smoking area! You know what? 20 years back, every businessman paid his bills. They would've been ashamed not to pay! But in today's society, it's like a national sport. Good, sign it. That's right. - Say hi to Xaver from me. I will. - And congratulate him. Branch manager! Not bad! Yeah, not bad! See you, Holger Savings Bank. Asshole mail... Asshole, asshole... And another one... Asshole mail! Aha... Those Negroes again. What does that asshole want here? My boss gave me instructions: Delivery only with advance payment. - He can kiss my ass! Fine, I'll use another anodizing firm! - Fine, but they'll want money too! Piss off! - I will, don't worry. Brenninger! Another payment reminder. Asshole! - You too! Mr Brenninger? - Yes? I'm Leyla. We spoke about the English correspondence job. Of course. But we could've spoken about it in the bank. Not a big talker, eh? Is that how you Turks are? Come on, let's go. Shall I just do it? - Yes! "Dear Mr so-and-so... - "So-and so"? My name's on it! - It says Brenninger. I thought that's obvious. - It's not! Just translate what's there. "Dear Mr Brenninger, you were recommended as an honest businessman. Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Dr Mike Uyi. I live in Nairobi, Kenya, where I've run a business for 15 years. I am forced to seek help due to the political situation here. I'm expecting a bank transfer of 15 million dollars." 15 million dollars! Those Negros! "It's not easy..." - Cut out that babble, and just tell me what they want! - So not what's written down? It says that if the money goes into a Kenyan account, it'll be taxed at 60% by the state. To avoid this, he wants it paid into your account. In return, you'll get 5%... of the 15 million. That's 750,000 dollars! Yes. What do the assholes want? - It doesn't say if they're assholes or not. I just say that sometimes. But they could find anyone to be a front man. It says they need someone they can trust. Is that okay for an hour? Take it. Nothing in life is free! Where did you learn such good English? English EC. - Extension course. Speak Turkish too? I'm Kurdish. But I can speak Turkish. What will you do now you've graduated? I want to be an ethnologist. - Ethno... what? - Ethnologist. And what do they do? You really want to know? - Yes, it interests me. I want to know what happens when an entire people dies out. What do your parents think of that? My father's dead already. Okay then... Goodbye. That's a good story. I like it. Get on the right side! My God! Get on the right side! So, Mucki! Daddy's coming! Mucki? It's me! How was it at the company? - Look at this! Another letter from Africa. - Africa? What do they want to buy? Pah! They don't have any money. Here, for you. Do you like them? They're lovely. Your stick likes it too. So... let's have a look here. I'm going for a nap. Yeah, you do that, Muckerl. Sleep tight. Get it away! Away! You just have to! The volume is amazing! You can't do that with classical music. Mucki, this is great! Absolutely great! Go! Piss off! Here he comes. The three big German DIY shops are OBI, Hagebau and Praktiker. Then there are another 5000 small retailers. And when Brenninger goes to OBI, they tell him he's not listed. You know what 'not listed' means? It means that Bonacker and Dickmann, the buyers for the big three, butter them up nicely. Then they're in business, got it? And little Brenninger has to go crawling to the 5,000 remaining retailers. Making small talk... "How are you, Madame?" "Yes, the new government's crap too." And if I'm lucky... they'll place an order for a few hundred euros. If I'm lucky. But Franzi, why do it if you don't make a profit? That's enough. Old Brenninger isn't in the mood today. You go home now, Franzi. Don't worry about it. Everything is just shit! You're crazy! I see a signpost there Ever fixed before my eyes I must travel a road By which no one has ever returned I must travel a road... ... by which no one has ever returned! Yes, that's it! All this old stuff! Crap! I don't know where I could wear any of this stuff! But you still buy dance dresses even though you can't dance anymore! Franz! It's 3:30 a.m. How do you know that, since you're supposedly almost blind? And if you're looking for your watch, I sold it! Your 20th anniversary present to me? - Yes, the Cartier which cost 5,000 marks back then. You think I've a Negro at the firm who shits out money? What did you do with the money? You don't want to know. Tell me! Think. You really want to know? Yes. Yes? - Yes. Alright, I'll tell you. I fucked away the money. Last week in the "Ritterbar" I paid for some asshole called Hammerl, so he'd give me a good price on the anodizing. There's a fat Negro woman working there, and he's totally crazy about her. So I treated him to this Negro woman. I did it for us. You understand, Mucki? For us! Now go back to sleep. How should I know? Yes! Schubert! You're an asshole! It's all over! Finished! What I'm doing... is total shit! It's all very simple... Franz? Franz! Can you hear me? What's going on inside you? Just tell me! Then we can share it. I don't understand you. All around is darkness... All around is darkness? Darkness... ... is shit! The kids were asking after you. The kids are shit! It's a totally sick situation. You two can't go on like this. Yes... he's gone really quiet again. You have to take him to a doctor. - We've been. I think it's getting worse. Yes. Mr Thalhammer from the tennis club called and said he'd threatened him. They want to throw him out, though he founded the club. That's not right either, is it? Why do you go along with it all? I still love him. In and out... that's the way! How much did all this cost? Pull yourself together. Talk to me. Come on. I'm practically bankrupt. And? What are you going to do? What are you reading... Dad? It's the AA encyclopaedia. I got it free after 30 years membership. It's quite something, eh? I keep having these thoughts going round in my head. How Grandad filed for bankruptcy after the war. And I always told you the story about it, didn't I? And how they hitched up those workhorses... and transported those heavy industrial hammers up the hill there to the castle. The loads were so heavy, and they beat the horses so brutally, that they were covered in blood afterwards. And I always walked with the horses because I felt sorry for the beasts. And those... bloodied beasts, they... just won't leave my head! Don't think such shit! But they won't go away. Try to forget it. Don't worry about the money, I'll talk to Holger tomorrow. Everything will work out. Yeah, it'll work out. Franz, I think Xaver is right. It's better to close down the firm... before it's too late. I looked at the accounts. The business is just losing money. But if you get out now, you'll still have enough to live on. The firm is dragging us all down. My God! You have to sell something! - Look, you both have pensions. And you still have the house. Yes, alright. I'll just go outside and wait in the car, okay? It can't go on anymore, Xaver. And I can't do anything more. Come on, you go that way. Why not stop by for a visit? The kids have forgotten they have a grandpa. And you'll soon have lots of time. - Okay, I'll come to visit you. I've got some photos. I brought them especially for you. - No, not right now. Bye, Daddy. Get in the inside lane! Damn it! - Hey, slow down! Asshole! Double asshole! Woman! So tell me about yourself, Mr... - Tom Kanabi. Yes. - First I must thank you, in my uncle's name, Dr Mike Uyi... You don't need to make a speech. Now, how is this meant to work? First we will go to a notary. There you'll sign a letter of attorney for my uncle, Mike Uyi. You don't think I'll let any old Joe access my bank account? It's sufficient to open one without having your own money on it. In return, my uncle is obliged to pay you 5% of the 15 million claim on the National Petroleum Corporation. How do you know whether this claim even exists? - Right. My father is the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Kenya. When will the money appear on my account? If we meet the notary next week, the transaction follows 2 weeks after. For opening this account, you will make a profit of 400-500,000 dollars, even after tax... Mr Brenninger. MEMBERSHIP CARD Hey, have you gone nuts? What's the matter, Mucki? I've had enough! But I need air, Mucki. I need air! Franz... You have to go. The brothel over there... Why is it so dark in here? So I can see you better. Like in the fairytale. Like in the fairytale, Leyla. Did he tell you about me? - Yes, about your good translations. Anything else? He used your first name. He never usually does that. That means he trusts you. You want me to look after him? Dear daughter, I know you mean well with the clinic, but your father can look after himself perfectly well. Yes, but things can't go on like this. Can you maybe tell me why? I'm itching to know. Your mother is probably rattled 'cause she threw me out. Or are you afraid I won't be able to enjoy myself? I don't want you to talk about Mum like that. - I'm talking about myself. You know when your mum last humped with me? That's not the point! - What is the point, Mr Wise-ass? Tell me that! Dad, you are ill. I'm ill? I'm just feeling good, you asshole! Dad, you're really ill! Of course I am! I take 12 different pills every morning! My stomach's rebelling. It's normal. - Then you offer a solution! What's it to you, loser? Sort out your own life! - At least I don't sell my wife's watch, squander the money in brothels, then brag to her about it afterwards! Yes, 'cause you don't even have a wife, you sexual flop! If you try to hang yourself like your dad, make sure it works. Yes, I'll do my best, sonny boy. You poor man, you can't help it. - You dare say that to me, asshole? - Please, I can't take this anymore. Dad, we just want to talk to you, to help you. Paula, it's pointless. Dad, go to Dr Eckart in Gabersee. He's been informed. Ah, daughter and son are calling up the madhouses, telling stories, just to get their hands on my money? Dad, you're totally nuts. Come on, Paula! Go on! Dad is nuts! - Paula, come on! I'd really like to help you. You needed help, and you got it. I paid the bills, for years. First German studies, then philosophy. Nothing less was good enough. Then came the next thing. For 20 semesters. Ten years. Your mum said, "We have to help her." And I helped, didn't I? Your so-called studies, at a rough estimate, cost me 200,000 marks! And instead of finishing any of your studies, you meet some guy called Marcel, have two children with him, and one of them is a retard! Maximilian is mentally handicapped. Sure, I know it wasn't easy for you. But in your whole life you haven't earned a single penny for yourself. And now you try to tell me what it's all about! - Finished? - Waiter! Now I'll be needing a double whiskey! So much for that, dearest daughter! Here to represent the recipient, Dr Mike Uyi, is Mr Tom Kanabi, employee of the Kenyan embassy. - May I smoke in here? Of course, Mr Brenninger. You too, Ms Polat? Allow me. Thanks, Mr Kenya. "In view of the large sum, Mr Brenninger is obliged to deposit a security fee of 50,000 euros to Dr Uyi's account, number 55413..." - Wait! What's all that about? What do you mean? - What you just read. You must provide a security deposit. - That was never mentioned before! You must understand that my uncle, who has never met you, would not allow the transfer of 15 million dollars to your account without any proof whatsoever of your integrity. Yes, but you can't spring that on me just before we sign the papers! My uncle is under intense pressure. The Kenyan authorities are getting suspicious. Gentlemen... it was a pleasure. That concludes things for me. Negroes and notaries! What assholes! Mucki! Mucki, it's me! Sticky! Sticky! I was a bit high-spirited of late. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But now I'm back again. Franz? Yes, Mucki? Franz, I can't see anything anymore! Think of it like an attack. It comes, then goes again. But if you don't react quickly, your wife will go blind. Irreversibly blind. Does the operation leave any negative effects? No, they are absolute specialists. How much is it going to cost? I'm Swiss, I... Yes, it's chilly out here. Go back in. - Goodbye. Shit! Go along to the canteen, please. The insurance won't pay. What do you mean? - They'll pay diddly squat. Nike from the tennis club told me, and he's a professor. He said there are only two clinics in Germany who can do it risk-free. How much does the operation cost? It costs 30,000 euros. And it has to be done within the next four weeks. I'll get you the money. I'll take care of it. - Very decent of you. Ms Monika! It'll be alright! But if not... Where? - Bottom right, please. This is insane, Franz! You have to understand! Xaver transfers 30,000 to you for an operation, then you transfer 50,000 to an account in Africa! So? Franz... I went to school with Xaver. I know how much he loves Martha. He cashed in a 10-year savings plan for this, you understand? Yes, I know it's not my business! But I don't give a damn! So tell me, what is the money for? I've signed an oath of silence, I'm sorry. There are laws about money-laundering. - Oh! Here is your transfer slip. Thanks, Holger. Thanks for your trust in me and our bank. Your business account and your credit line will be cancelled at the next possible date. That's in one week. Goodbye. Goodbye, Holger. So what does that mean? As I understand it, they have to pay off the finance ministry. A pay-off? And they want another 50,000 euros for that? What do you mean, 'another'? Well... There was nothing about another 50,000 in the contract! They couldn't write it in the contract. But I don't have it! I don't have it! Tell those assholes I don't have it! It's over! I want my deposit back, or I'll be bankrupt! I want out! Say it! Tell them! They hung up. I need my money. The 50,000 euros! I need it now! Hello! What? Yes, I come! I come, you asshole! I come and find! Kiss my ass! That's not possible... You fucking damned nigger! You shitty fucking dirty nigger! Fuck you in your fucking shitty Africa! Fucking bastard! ... your fucking, stinking... Africa! This is a nigger music! At last! What's so urgent? Leyla, I'm going to Africa. You're joking, right? - No. What do you think? I haven't thought about it. I thought you'd come as a translator. - Me? - Yes. It's the end of the line, I can't pay anymore. I need my money from down there. Really urgently. And I need your help. So, off we go to Mucki. Mucki, time for me to go. I'll be back in 10 days. Franz! Don't go, please. What? - You mustn't go! But I'll be coming back, Mucki. See you! Where do you come from? From Wasserburg. Wasserburg? - Am Inn! Wasserburg am Inn. Go away! Out! Out! Out! Drive on! Go on! Piss off! Drive on! I'll sleep on the sofa. Is he fucking with me, or what? What is that place? He's supposed to live here. Don't know him? How should he live here? I... I am German. May I help you? My name is Aban. Yes, sit down. My name is Brenninger. I'm looking for someone here... and I need help to find him. I'm looking for a Mr Uyi. Dr Mike Uyi. May I present Ambassador Dr Hannes von Hörmann. Nice to meet you. Please sit down. - Thanks. Mr Brenninger, I'd like you to know that we take your problem seriously, very seriously indeed. Five years back I called in Interpol, and for the situation you are in... I'll give you two pieces of advice: Leave well alone. It is extremely dangerous. I can see what you want to do here. You think you can come to Nairobi, put a bit of pressure on the gang, and they'll pay up rather than face Franz Brenninger's wrath. Right? And now the second piece of advice: Just treat it as a holiday. And what are they paying you to brush me off, Mr Ambassador? How much? You may think what you like! Mr Brenninger, people have died as a result of this business. They return home in the cargo hold. Think about it. Bring our guests downstairs, Röth. We'll never get out of here. I can't take it, I gotta get out! This is... Hello, I am... I come from... Germany. I like it here. I really like it here. This is something different. I have to get out of here. This city is a hell-hole! My wife disappeared here 21 years ago. That's why I'm here. Botswar's taxi is round the corner, he'll take you to your hotel. If you leave me like that again, I'll be gone. There beyond the village Stands a hurdy-gurdy man And with his frozen fingers He plays as best he can Barefoot on the ice He sways to and fro And his little bowl Is always empty No one wants to hear him No one looks at him And the dogs growl Around the old man And he justlets it happen Just as it will He plays, and his hurdy-gurdy Is never still Strange old man Shall I go with you? Will you play your hurdy-gurdy To accompany my songs? I studied 3 years at the music academy, but it didn't work out. It just didn't work out. My name is Friedländer. I want to thank you, I've never heard it played like that. Martha? Mucki? It's me, Franz. I'm calling from Africa. I wanted to talk to you. How are you? I'll sort the money thing out, you don'tneed to worry. Alright then... I'm going to hang up now. Franz, you have to get out! Yes... We have to get out of here. Everything is so dark. There's something I have to hear. The songs... I have to listen to Schubert. Come in! Please. You want a recording of the 'Winter Journey'? You know anything about it? They're just songs he likes. I wanted to make him happy. - They're not just songs! The 'Winter Journey' is a description of depression. A cycle of horrifying songs about the suffering of a lonely man lost in a winter landscape. Who should like that? The penultimate song is called 'The False Suns'. As a kid, I thought it was 'Fog Suns'. Why the 'false suns'? Because there are three. It's the song where the man loses his mind because he sees three suns. Two suns stand for the eyes, for that which we see. The third sun is the realization that our eyes deceive us. "I saw three suns in the sky, Stared at them long and hard And they stood there so stubbornly, As if they didn't want to leave. Ah, you are not my suns! Go, gaze into someone else's face! Yes, I recently had three, Now the best two have set. If only the third would also set! I shall feel better in the dark. I shall feel better in the dark." I came here a stranger, As a stranger I depart. The month of May favoured me With many a bunch of flowers. The girl spoke of love, Her mother Even spoke of marriage. Now the world is so gloomy, The road shrouded in snow. What's the matter? - I want to leave. But you can't, not yet. I don't want to wait anymore. We've achieved nothing so far. Yes, alright then. Maybe you're right. Let's get out of here. See you later! It's in the middle of nowhere! Why are we going there? - To explore the land and its people. You'll like it, you'll see. Leave it to me. Simply enjoy it. Nothing! Listen! No word! You keep your mouth shut! I have to talk to you. I'm tired. Listen to me. There's 200,000 dollars in the car. 40,000 is for you, you'll need it as an ethnologist. Give the rest to Martha and the kids. Be careful, it's a lot of money. Well, I have to be going. The blind black man told me that we are dying our whole life long. What we call death is really just the end of death. Redemption. Thatgave me comfort.
