"Chicago. "Hog Butcher for the World, "Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, "Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler, "Stormy, husky, brawling, City of Big Shoulders." Those are the proud words of Carl Sandburg. It's how we like to think of our city. Underneath the carpet of our complacency and inertia was the dirt which had caked up again since Al Capone, Mr Big, was put out of circulation. We'd fooled ourselves into believing that the air was fresh and pure again, but all that had happened under Mr Big was small potatoes compared to the syndicate which had taken over the mantle of crime and corruption on a nationwide scale. As I learned when Nelson Kern paid me a visit. This time, they were hiding behind a phoney veneer of legitimate enterprises. And it wasn't long after Mr Kern left my office when it all started again. Hey, Mr Kern! That's when I knew for certain that Kern hadn't lied to me, that they were back in business, bigger and dirtier than ever, a malignancy that would have to be cut out at the core. By nightfall, it was all over town. The radio and the newspapers were full of it. Nelson Kern, respected head of the highly successful accounting and business management firm, Kern Associates, by his own admission to David Heaiey, editor of the Chicago Telegraph, branded himself a close working associate of Arnold Valent, alleged head of Chicago's vast crime cartel. Later that night, Mrs Kern committed suicide. She left a note for her daughter, Joyce Kern, living in France the last four years, engaged to some guy in the State Department. You know, usual thing. Crowds, newspapers hounding her. Couldn't face the scandal, the disgrace. By the next morning, the news services were giving us the story on Joyce Kern. She had disappeared from Paris, was rumoured to be on her way to a sanatorium in Switzerland. Her fiance's family issued a formal statement for the press. If there had ever been an engagement, it was all off now. That was it. Dirty. Hey, fellas, come here! A heater, for real. Golly, it's a real gun. Late that afternoon, I met with a group of men at one of the Loop hotels. They were quite a collection. Clarence Haynes, who was Kern's lawyer. Henry Nugent, owner of one of our largest department stores. Sam Landell, one of our foremost business executives. Harold Unkers, president of a utility company. Detective Lieutenant Robert Fenton. He'd fought the mob in the old days and hated their guts. And Pat Winters, state attorney and Illinois' leading crime-buster. Kern was hired by Unicorn Casualty and Life. The insurance company that occupies the building on Clark Street? Right. He told me he discovered it was just a legitimate front for all of Valent's illegitimate enterprises. The more Kern saw, the dirtier he began to feel. He felt he had to wash his hands for the sake of his family as well as himself. Why did he go to you? Well, he said Valent had a lot of friends in the right places. He wanted me to front for him. Act on his behalf in making a deal with the Federal and State authorities and make sure the police guaranteed his family the maximum protection possible. - Mr Winters... - Yes, sir. Seems to me the Attorney General's Office should be able to do something. Well, we can't build a case without evidence, and that isn't easy to come by. Sure, the big dough still rolls in from gambling, shakedowns, vice, all the other rackets, but what happens to the money? For every illegal operation, the syndicate has a dozen legitimate fronts. So, a little of the take drifts into this business and a little into that. Pretty soon, it's like trying to separate sewer water from the ocean. Well, what do you suggest, Dave? That we pack up and move? Not if you're willing to open your chequebooks and take a gamble. Just what's on your mind? Some information came in this morning that we may be able to hang our hats on. We know who killed Kern. That is, who pulled the trigger. A kid found the gun this morning on a piling. It belonged to a hood by the name of Mel Burke. He's one of Valent's boys. - Did you arrest him? - No. I sent out a tracer on him without telling anybody why. But even when I do find him, I'm not going to pick him up. Oh, we asked him not to. You see, if we pick up Burke, we get ourselves one small fry. He means nothing. We think we may be able to use this information as bait for the big fry. You understand this is all under wraps, of course. That's why I called you all together. We've got an opportunity to break the syndicate, but it'll take money. I've already contacted the other newspapers. They're willing to co-operate to clean out this element. So you can see I'm here as a representative of all the dailies. First time we've ever agreed on anything. That's quite true. Well, I'm sure money will be no problem. Good. That's what I wanted to hear. You'll be apprised of everything we do when it happens. Gentlemen, I, uh, suggest we leave one at a time. Thirty-six, single. Background, attended Northwestern University to prepare for CPA and career. Took business administration and commercial law to get his Bachelor of Science. Two years as Infantry Officer during the war. Four major campaigns. Decorated twice. Wounded, transferred to Judge Advocate's Office. Helped crack a million-dollar black market operation in France. Now living here in Chicago, auditor for the Internal Revenue Bureau, grade seven. - Sounds made to order. - He is. I got to know him well during the war. I was his CO. We've kept in touch since. Do you think he'll go for this deal? Well, he's ambitious. Wants to get out on his own. Could fly pretty high on $60,000. I wouldn't know. This was the man Winters wanted for the job. His name was Barry Amsterdam. After Barry had been introduced to us, we quickly briefed him on what we wanted him to do. Unicorn's a syndicate front, a financial clearing house, but we've got to prove it. And that's where you come in. Kern was an accountant. Tax expert. Break it all down and it still adds up to a high-priced bookkeeper, right? I should only be such a bookkeeper. Kern operated first class. Brooks Brothers suits, dollar cigars... Just the way I'd like to operate when I get out on my own. But on the level, Lieutenant. Play along with us and you will. Kern said he had enough evidence to put Valent on ice for the next hundred years. Now, what kind of evidence could a bookkeeper get his hands on? Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute, you want me to find out what Kern found out, is that it? That's it. I've already taken the liberty of speaking to your commissioner. He'll co-operate, if you're willing. Well, it's very nice to have met you gentlemen. Pat, I'll get out at the next corner. You were born for the job, Barry. I was born to die in bed at the age of ninety. Winters said you were a bright boy. I'm bright enough to be a coward where the syndicate is concerned. I'm not cut out for this cloak-and-dagger stuff. We think you are. Give me one good reason why I should stick my neck out. We can give you 60,000 good reasons. What? Sixty thousand dollars, Mr Amsterdam, if you pull this job off. You wanted to set up your own accounting and business management firm, didn't you? Yes. Yes, of course I did, but I wanted to do it while I was alive. Look, Mr Amsterdam, you're going to get sixty grand for doing what the guys on the force do every day, and you know how long it takes them to make sixty grand? Twelve years. All right. You shamed me into it, Lieutenant. You and the 60,000. ♪ One at a time, one at a time ♪ You better be in love with one at a time ♪ Take my advice, you're gonna find ♪ You're better off loving one at a time ♪ Men from twenty to eighty-three don't go in for variety ♪ When you start lovin' two or more ♪ Trouble comes a knockin' at the door ♪ One at a time, one at a time ♪ You better be in love with one at a time ♪ Tell all the gals that you decline ♪ To be in love with more than one at a time ♪ Old King Solomon thought he could ♪ Have a lot more than one man should ♪ But when he felt the end was near ♪ This is what he shouted for all to hear ♪ One at a time, one at a time ♪ You better be in love with one at a time ♪ Take my advice, you're gonna find ♪ You're better off lovin' one at a time ♪ One at a time, one at a time ♪ You better be in love with one at a time ♪ Tell all the girls that you decline ♪ To be in love with more than one at a time ♪ One at a time, one at a time ♪ You better be in love with one at a time ♪ Tell all the girls that you decline ♪ You better be in love with one at a time ♪ - Well... - Stinger. I feel lucky again. Sue, be sensible, will ya? You've been in there twice now and each time you've taken a bath. Isn't that enough? Well, I happen to enjoy it. Do you mind? You know, I've been trying to determine whether you're more fascinated by gambling than by gamblers. After all, the way you played up with them... Really, for a new date, don't you think you're taking too much for granted? I don't trust that kind. They'd just as soon cut your throat as look at you. Look, why don't we compromise, Tony? You go home, and I'll take a cab later. Over my dead body. How would I know the difference? Okay, Sue, it's your throat. See you around, honey. Oh, Tony? The card, please. You must've been born in Las Vegas. This time, Sue, why don't you try Moe's system? Moe always wins. He says you can't lose if you just bet on winning numbers. Of course, if you insist on betting on losing numbers... - What's the big idea? - Moe always wins. Oh, it's just that I wouldn't wanna see you take another bath. On the other hand, it might be a very pleasant sight. Next time, ask your friend Moe to tell you how to get in here without using me for a front! But where would I find a more attractive front? Four, even, black. Oh, you'll never beat it that way. Really? I suppose Moe told you a better system. Mmm-hmm. He said to watch you and do exactly the opposite. Place your bets, folks. Well, like they say, every man to his own poison. What's yours? Red, even. Black, odd. Twenty-five, red, odd. Haven't you had enough? I'll have to have this okayed, Miss Morton. - All right, I'll be at the bar. - Thank you. You're not serious about going back there for more punishment, are you? Why not? The night's young. Compared to you, it's ancient. Whatever that means. Honey, when it comes to gambling, you belong in diapers. When it comes to gambling. I've just had a streak of bad luck. - It'll change. - Sure. Sure it will. Just as soon as you go out that door. The gent may have a point there, Miss Morton. - Excuse me, Gilbert. - Certainly, Brad. - I'm Brad Lacy. - Yes, I know. I'm happy to meet you, Mr Lacy. About this cheque, Miss Morton, I'd like to help you out, but we have a strict policy about cashing personal cheques. Afraid it might bounce? Wouldn't be the first time it's happened. Not that I think this one will. Like I said, it's just a matter of policy. Mr Lacy? You, uh, seen Mel Burke around? He hasn't been around in some time. That's what I figured. Since about, uh, Tuesday, huh? If you happen to see him, uh, tell him someone saw him make the hit. He might be interested. There's a guy out there, said he saw Mel Burke make the hit. - Where is he? - He's over by the cashier's window. Get Valent on the phone. Well, look, with the horses you play, you put up two, you get back two and a half. What good is that? So I put up two grand, I get 2500". Oh! Gee, I'm sorry. Jeez, buddy, we was just talking about the horses. I know, yeah, it's all right, thanks. That's a lot of weapon for only a dime. Mr Barry Amsterdam. Better than smelling salts, huh? Didn't I just see you at the Tropicana shaking your maracas? My fan club. I told you I had talent. Still hurt? Only when I laugh. Need an emcee, Connie? Dance? Sing? I don't know about his dancing, but I got a hunch he can sing like a mink. You like that music, Mr Amsterdam? Old stuff, isn't it? Everything gets better with age except women. They don't write songs like that anymore. Of course, they used to play it faster, but then everything was fast in those days. Twenty, twenty-five years ago, huh? I imagine you were a lot faster yourself. A philosopher. College man. - Must be Phi Beta whatchamacallit. - Kappa. - Kappa or copper? - Oh, you read the clipping. Yes, what do you carry it with you for? To impress the girls? I don't as a rule, but I thought you boys might enjoy it - more than they would a comic book. - Oh, figured we'd frisk ya, huh? How else was I gonna get in to see ya? You took money under the table, huh? Guess the table wasn't low enough. You must be a lousy tax man if they found it out. They found it out because Landell got drunk one night and he shot off his mouth. - For your scrapbook. - Thanks. I read about that a few days ago. One of the other papers gave you a much bigger spread. Ah, like the man said, I don't care what you say about me, - just so you spell my name right. - The man was wrong. In some business, it's better if no-one sees your name. You know who I am? Of course I do, you're Arnie Valent. I've seen your picture in the paper a couple times. You see what I mean? Publicity is good for actors and politicians only. You know why you're here? - I can guess. - You tell me. I saw Mel Burke make the hit. "The hit." College man. Don't talk to me as if I were some gangster or something. I understand good English. All right. I saw Burke kill Kern. You just happened to be there at the time, huh? I was coming out of the Federal building. The Bureau was giving me my walking papers, so I was walking. How did you know Burke? I didn't. Never saw him before in my life. - How did you know it was him? - I got a pretty good look at him and I had an idea I could find out who he was. Who said you could have a drink? Excuse me. Go ahead, but ask first. Like I said, I thought I had an idea how I could find out who it was. I went to the cops. I told them that somebody had stolen my hubcaps, and I thought I could recognise the thief. They let me look through the mug shots, and I picked out Burke's picture. You told them that Burke stole your hubcaps? The cops laughed even harder. They said Burke was one of your boys and that he didn't have to go around lifting hubcaps. Well, I told them I guess maybe I'd made a boo-boo and... Well, that's how I found out who shot Kern. Why didn't you tell the police, Mr Amsterdam? Barry, to my friends. Why didn't you tell the police, Mr Amsterdam? Ouch. Well, supposing I had. 80 what? I get a pat on the back for outstanding service to the community and, a couple of days later, I get a bullet hole in the same place. You want a payoff for keeping your mouth shut, is that it? I'll let you tell me what it's worth to you. I'll tell you what it's worth. Nothing. So you go to the police. 80 they pick up Burke. So he doesn't talk. 80 I know nothing about it. Why am I here then? That's a good question. You a lawyer too? Hmm. Commercial law, business management, stuff like that. Business management, huh? That's a good background. Shame to waste it on the tax department. I'll tell you why you're here, Mr Amsterdam. Because I don't like trouble. If you go to the police and tell them that Burke killed Kern, immediately the papers say that Arnie Valent is behind it. Do they know? They know nothing. I say I don't know anything about it. Kern was my friend. But I'm supposed to be a big man in the syndicate. "Syndicate"! A fancy word they made up. I don't even know what they mean. But, like I say, I don't like trouble. That's why you're here. If I'd wanted to cause you trouble, Mr Valent, I'd have done it by now. You want a job? Strictly legitimate, I don't touch anything else. One hundred dollars a week. Is there a future in it for me? There's either a good future for you, Mr Amsterdam, or there's no future at all. Go down to the Unicorn Casualty and Life Insurance company tomorrow morning and ask for Jack Roper. Take him home. Mr Valent told me to come in and see you. See Ben Lewis, he's head of accounting. - He'll show you what to do. - Thank you. Get me Mr Valent. What do you think of the little enchilada I ran into? Maybe she'll be good for the Ralph band in 'Frisco. What do you think of it, Connie? Can she sing? Oh, with a chest like that, she ought to sing bass. - You saw enough. - Get her. Mr Roper calling. - Adiós, boss. - Bye. Yes, Jack. Amsterdam just came in. I turned him over to Lewis in the accounting department. Good. Keep your eye on him. Let me know everything he does. If he works out, I have some plans for him. Okay, Arnie, I'll keep you posted. Good. Would you stop filing your nails at the table? Where were you brought up, anyway? Sometimes I wonder why I put up with you. Want me to tell you? Now don't get funny. Will you lay off the gargle so early in the morning? Barry was smart enough not to rush things. He wanted to wait until they accepted him as a permanent fixture, knowing all the time that they were watching every move he made, not only in the office, but even when he tried to get lost in the heavy shopping crowds at the Loop. Barry knew there was always someone tailing him to see where he was going, who his friends were, or whether he would make a contact. Barry knew it was going to be tough to shake that shadow, or at least be one jump ahead of it, so that he could keep a date he had made in the Northern Indian and Eskimo wing of the Chicago Museum of Natural History. Put the necklace bid into operation anytime now. Sit down, Barry. What's this you told Ben Lewis about settling that Cleo Allen claim? Seventy-five grand's a lot of dough to be handing out, especially if we can duck it. She lost a diamond and, uh, emerald necklace. What's wrong with it? Nothing wrong, but I can beat it. Legitimately, I mean. Everything strictly on the up and up. I can't take that chance. All she has to do is drag us into court. She won't, don't worry. You seem pretty sure of yourself. Well, I wouldn't be wasting your time if I wasn't. What have you got to lose? If it doesn't pan out, you write the lady a cheque, and that's that. It's just not healthy, that's all. You start messing around with business ethics... Look, I'm not selling any, I'm just trying to save you 70,000 bucks. Seventy thousand? What happened to the other five? Well, you see I'm, um... I'm not eligible for the regular Christmas bonus. I thought maybe I could earn one. Ethically? Smelling like a rose. Let me think about it. Did he tell you how he's gonna pull it off? No, but he wants five grand for himself if he does. That's what I like about him, Jack. He's hungry for money. That could be good for us. - Shall I let him go ahead? - Yeah, let's see how he does it. You hit the jackpot. Fix it. Well, that's the nicest necklace I never owned. Oh, Lieutenant Fenton gave me a message for you. Valent went to the fights with Roper. Oh, thanks. Thanks very much. - Hi, Mr Roper. - Hi, Barry. - Mr Valent. - Oh, where you sitting? Oh, I'm back up there with the peasants. Swap with him. You'll see better there. Thanks. You remember Connie. Never pass a brandy bottle that I don't think of her. Mr Chico, Mr Amsterdam. - Hi, Mr Chico. - Hello. He comes to all the fights, but he hates 'em. Oh, it will never take the place of jai alai. What happened to that claim you were going to fix up, Barry? Just a lot of talk, huh? There you are. All signed, sealed and delivered. - She's withdrawing the claim? - Read it. Hit him with a left, stupid! Hit him! Looks like Barry made a gift of $75,000 to the stockholders. Seventy thousand. Mr Roper promised me five if I delivered. That claim looked pretty solid to me. How did you manage it? Well, in checking the claim, I noticed that while the policy was made out to Cleo Allen, someone else was making the payments on the premiums. Guess who? Henry Nugent. Old Holy Joe himself. He's married and got three kids. That's what came to my mind. I figured that if Nugent were making the payments on the insurance, he must also have bought the necklace. Blackmail is a touchy proposition, Barry. Oh, Mr Roper, I wouldn't stoop that low. I simply told Mr Nugent that the company might have to contest the claim. In that event, there'd be witnesses and, uh, evidence subpoenaing. Well, the next thing I knew, the old boy was telling me to pick up a letter at the theatre, and that's all there was to it. You earned the five grand, Barry. Oh, thanks, Mr Valent, but I'm still looking for that future you promised me. Don't blame you. I'd like to get my fingers on some of that real long green, regular-like. I've been poor and I've been rich. Take it from me, rich is better. Come on, I've seen enough of this. You'll be hearing from me. Don't you wanna stay and see who wins? Are you kidding? Valent wanted to test Barry, so he gave him the set of books Kern kept for government examiners only. If Barry blew the whistle on him, Valent knew he was protected because these were not his personal books. But Barry knew it was a dry run. Valent had messed them up just enough to have Barry holler to the authorities. He knew that, somewhere, there was another set of books. Valent's own. Shape those books were in, I can't believe that Kern kept them. - Why not? - There were some holes in there big enough to drive Leavenworth through. A guy could get killed with books like that. Yeah, maybe that's what he wanted. I thought you said he was your friend. That's what I thought. Well, they're all right now. You can take them to the Internal Revenue and get a clean bill of health. Mind if I have a drink? You don't have to ask. Yep? Yeah. Like I said. What do you want? Just like to ask you a few questions. How did you get in here? Oh. Oh, police. We heard you saw who bumped Kern. Oh, did you now? Now, where'd you hear that? - Things get around. - What do you think? Valent's got a tab on what we're doing, and we don't have a tab on what he's doing? That kind of dirt travels fast on a two-way street. Why don't you take me down to headquarters? If we take you down there, and you say you saw nothin', that ends it. We can't question you there like we can here. Oh, I see. Your questions might be different down there, but my answers'd be the same. You boys had better get a refund. You bought the wrong dirt. Good night, fellas. I'm going to bed. Uh. You don't listen good, do you? I miss something? We said the reason that we're not dragging you in is because we can question you better here. I don't see the difference. You get the difference now? You saw Mel Burke trigger Kern, didn't ya? Valent ain't here to take care of ya now. - So give it! - No, wait a minute. Wait a minute, fellas. - Don't get smart. - Yeah, don't... Don't hit me anymore. I'll tell you everything you... Where's Mr Valent? He's in bed. I wanna see him. I told ya, he's in bed. I don't care whether he's in bed or not. I wanna see him. Just a minute, Mack. Ah, it's all right, Hugo. What's the trouble, Barry? I just wanna tell you this. You can take your books and your job and everything else you got, and you know what you can do with it. - What's eating you? - If you don't trust me, you don't want me and I don't want you. How did you know? No cops could afford suits like they wore. Besides that, to be a cop, you gotta have some education. Those two goons talked like they've been left back six times in the fourth grade. Well, don't be hard on me, Barry. You know by now I can't be too careful. Did I ever do anything to make you run a test on me? Now, forget it. Let's just say I goofed. Remember when I gave you that job at Unicorn, I told you there'd either be a good future for ya or no future at all. - Yeah, which is it? - Good. I'm gonna give ya a chance to make some of that big money you've been itching for. I need somebody to make some spot checks for me. Make sure some of the boys haven't been holding out since Kern died. Well, that shouldn't be too hard to do. What's in it for me? Ten per cent of everything they've been holding out on me. - You feel better now? - Oh, yeah, sure. That long green can cure most everything. Come on, make yourself a drink. From Chicago, nerve centre of the operation, Barry now learned how the syndicate worked. It was like a giant octopus whose tentacles spread from Chicago into practically every state in the Union. The syndicate took in from ten to fifteen million a year from gambling alone. Another twenty million from shakedowns and all the other rackets. This money was turned over to underlings who operated bars, nightclubs, all sorts of joints, by the hundreds. The syndicate also controlled, for example, ice companies. And who used ice? Bars and nightclubs. So, for a lot of ice cubes that were never delivered, the bars paid the ice companies a fortune. Valent would hold the ice companies a few years and then sell to the Unicorn Casualty Insurance Company. Through Unicorn, the money flowed out to finance other businesses, some phoney, some legitimate. Trucking, distilleries, the Sapphire Hotel in Miami, and dozens of other enterprises. It was one pocket to another, multiplied a hundred times. Big profits, small taxes, since it all became capital gains, and the syndicate stayed clean. When he got through checking, he told Valent in what spots he was being taken and by whom. - You know Ben Hammond? - How are you? Uh, Delaware, Mohawk Loan and Mortgage, right? That's right. Sid Lowe. Uh, Detroit, Larson's Used Cars. - That's it. - Henderson. Henderson's easy. I came from there. St Louis, Apex Ice. - No mistake. - Miller. Miller is, uh, Miami. Peacock Room. - I had a good time there. - I saw ya! - What a memory for names, huh? - And for figures. He scared me more than the tax boys. - Where'd you find him? - I didn't. He found me. What is there I don't like about him? Probably Arnie. I never figured a pair of pants would push me out of the picture. Oh, a man gets to a certain age, he's more interested in brains than dames. Arnie ain't that old. Sweeten this, would you, please? Well, if it isn't the lady gambler. What are you doing here, slumming? I wasn't until now. Oh, flattery will get you nowhere. And who fronted for you so you could crash in here? Oh, no-one. I've been spoiled by you. Whaddaya say? Let's be friends. Let's not be anything. Well, not that it will break your heart, but I have to leave. Is he your old friend? I told you before, I don't even know his name. You will. See where he went? - Inner sanctum. - For big wheels only. I'm not that big, Sue. I just take orders. They give 'em. - What did you say his name was? - I didn't. But it's Amsterdam. Barry Amsterdam. Valent's number one man. She a big wheel too? Valent's personal property. He likes young stuff. I told you to get out and stay out. I think she just aged ten years. I'm gonna make this short and sweet. After Kern wasn't around anymore, some of the boys thought they'd fatten up at my expense. Smart. Didn't think I'd find out about it. So some of the money that was supposed to come through didn't. They weren't satisfied with their cut. They wanted part of mine. Well, what's part of mine is part of yours. But they forgot one thing. That sooner or later, I'd dig up somebody as smart as Kern. Maybe smarter. Barry. So those that got a little extra green on their fingers got a warning. The others are out, for good. Now, I want you to pass the word down the line that if there's any more holdouts, there'll be no more warnings. No more talk. No more nothing. They're finished. Now, go out and have some fun. I'll go to the bar and get a drink. Truce pact? What did you do, spike it with hemlock? You're a trusting soul, aren't you? Well, I must say our relations haven't exactly been cordial. Well, I'm trying to remedy it. What else can I do? You know, that's a leading question, and I hope it's leading to where I think it is. To, uh, better relations between us? Would you do me a favour? Oh, I knew there was a catch to this truce pact business. Well, I hope it's not that bad. I just wanted you to take me home. You wanted me to... Well, um, what would Lacy say? What could he say? He takes orders, you give them. Friend of yours, Barry? Oh, yes. Miss Morton, Mr Valent. - How do you do? - We met some time ago, when we both carved our initials in the leg of a roulette table. - You have good taste, Barry. - Thank you. "You have good taste, Barry." Same line he handed me when Chico first brought me around. - You're drunk. - What have I got to be sober about? - You'd better go home. Chico. - Wanna get rid of me, huh? Got your eye on this new hunk of merchandise that bright boy brought around. He's good with the figures all right, in more ways than one. Shut up. - Come, Connie, I'll take you home. - Nobody's taking me home! I wanna stay, I'll stay! Nobody pushes Connie around because I can do some pushing myself... - Now, get her out of here! - Come, Connie, let's go home. I'm, uh... I'm sorry, Miss Morton. You don't have to go to all this trouble, Sue. - I'm really a pushover. - That's one out of left field. Thanks. Oh, wow! - You see it go by? - What? My hat. Like a chaser? No, thanks. The way you're mixing these, I'd probably need a chaser for the chaser. What are you after? What makes you think I'm after something? You've got more switches than a railroad yard. First, you give me the brush. Now, you're romancing me like I was Liberace. A woman's prerogative to change her mind. It's a man's prerogative to find out why she changed it. Well, I just decided I'd rather have you as a friend than an enemy. All right, so we're friends. Just what are you trying to prove, friend? Soft light, stiff drinks, loaded conversation. What have I got that you want? Maybe I'm just fascinated by men who live in shadows. Oh, brother, shadows yet. Well, you don't have to make fun of me just because I'm hospitable. Does this "hospitable" business include Arnie Valent as well? How did Valent get in here? Oh, he hasn't yet, but I have a feeling he will, if you have your way. Look, let's stop this footsie business. You don't like Valent. He's not your type. Aren't you presuming a lot? You almost upchucked tonight when he pushed Connie around, yet you pretended it was all right. Why? Where are you climbing? Climbing? From Lacy to Amsterdam to Valent. A triple play, is that what you had in mind? You make it sound as though I were Mata Hari. Hey, you know what happened to her. She caught her death of cold standing in front of a firing squad. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. That was clumsy of me. - Here, I'll pick up the pieces... - Oh, I'm so sorry. It's all right, all right. I'll live. If you just get me a Band-Aid or something, I'll be as good as new. Find what you were looking for, Mr Amsterdam? Yes, I think so. The, um, the "J.K." on the luggage... Now, what could that J stand for? Jean? Janet? Jenny! No. No, "Jenny" doesn't seem to suit you. It'd be more like, uh... Joyce? And the K... I wonder, if by any possible chance, that could stand for "Kern". Joyce Kern? Now that you've found what you're looking for, suppose you tell me what I'm looking for. All I know is what I read in the papers. May I? Mr Amsterdam, you said something before. "Let's stop playing footsie." My father's been killed, and my mother's dead because of it. Well, my hair's down now and my hate is showing. So, before this gun goes off, perhaps you'll tell me who killed my father. What makes you think I know? You're Valent's number one man, remember? You give orders, others take them. Supposing I told you to, uh, put that thing away. There, you see? People don't always do what they're told. You little idiot! What do you think you're doing, playing games? If Valent finds out who you are, he'll strip the skin off your lily-white back! Well, you're his number one boy, aren't you? What are you waiting for? I should. I should at that, but then the neighbours might complain about the noise and I'd have to spend the night in jail. Besides that, I prefer your skin where it is, on your back. You see, I had a weak spot for a gal named Sue Morton. Now, let me give you a little A-1 advice. You get out of this town and stay out! Don't ever let me see you around here again! Next time, I won't care if the neighbours do complain. - 407, please. - Second door to your right. Thank you. - Hello, Barry. - Hi. Dave, why didn't you tell me that Kern's daughter was playing Sue Morton, girl detective? Nobody knew until she went to see Haynes after you found her out. She'd taken a tramp steamer home from Europe without telling anyone. Oh, the little dope could've wound up on the bottom of some river. - Did Haynes tell her about me? - He felt he had to. Thought it would make her feel better to know someone was trying to get Valent. Well, I just hope he told her to keep off my neck. How are things going, Amsterdam? Oh, fine, fine. I'm getting rich fast. We're paying you sixty grand to get Valent, - not to get rich off him. - Yes, I know. I know. A weaker man would be tempted, believe me I never saw so much cash floating around. What about his personal books? No, sits on them like a hen on eggs. Nobody gets to look at those. Unless maybe it's this girl, Connie. She seems to have something on him. I thought he trusted you. Where his own books are concerned, he doesn't even trust his mother. He's got one, too. But he's been hinting lately. Hinting? At what? Well, evidently his own personal bookkeeping was all loused up when Kern died. He's been talking about setting up some kind of a business partnership with me. Probably wants me to keep an eagle eye on his own funds. Can't we get Valent through some of those phoney companies he set up? Mmm, no, no, no. He's too smart for that. None of those companies are registered in his name. They're all held in the name of some flunky of his, a front man who cuts it up with Arnie. You clamp one and you get the front man, but not Arnie. No, you can't touch him that way. Then the only solution is to get a look at Valent's own books. That's only half of it. The other half is gonna be much tougher. Getting them out of his hands to use as evidence. You're getting the sixty grand, you figure it out. I came to tell you how sorry I am. - I had no idea that... - Wait a minute. Come on in. Haynes was a fool to tell you. No, he wasn't. It made me feel better to know that... there's some people trying to do something about this. After my father was killed, I... I heard nothing more. - I was desperate. - I know. But it's better this way, believe me. You'd have only gummed things up. Besides, that's much too pretty a neck to stick out. If I can ever do anything to help... Just stay out of the way. And, whatever you do, keep using that Sue Morton moniker. All right, Barry. Good luck. Sue... Uh, Joyce. I'm gonna ask you something. It's not gonna be very pleasant for you, but... Well, you were your father's only legatee. He left everything he had to you. Since you've been back, have you come across anything that you think I should know about? No, not that I know of. But then, I didn't know much about his affairs, having spent the last few years in Europe. I'm gonna ask you to do me a favour. Would you get a hold of every paper, bill, letter, receipt, anything at all that belonged to your father, and bring them here to me? I'd like to look at them. You can't tell, it might... Excuse me. Hello? Barry? Arnie. I want you to take a little ride with me. I wanna show you something. I wanna show you some figures. Some very special figures you haven't seen before. - I'll pick you up in ten minutes. - Fine, fine. I'll, um... I'll meet you downstairs. I'll be waiting. Right. - Valent. - Yes. I'm finally gonna get a look at his personal books, the ones your father kept for him. This is the evidence that I've been waiting for. Got to let Fenton know, but I don't know where Valent's taking me. Did you come in a cab or did you drive? I drove. My car's downstairs. I'll give you a chance to play girl detective, only this time for blood. You know where I'm taking you? I'll find out soon enough, I guess. You're gonna meet my old lady. You'll like her. She still worries about me, like the friends I keep. Like I was still a kid. Well, they're all the same. - To them, you never grow up. - Yeah. You know that partnership I talked to you about? I've decided to go through with it. You'll check on everything the way Kern did. That's why I want you to see my system of bookkeeping. Now this partnership, how's it gonna work? I'll cut you in on everything from my end. - Thanks, Arnie. - You've earned it. One other thing. Uh, these books will be mine, but they'll be in your name. Oh, if anything goes wrong and they're found... Then you'll take the rap. - You'll be in the clear. - Right. Is this the way you worked it with Kern? No, I made a mistake with Kern. Those books were in my name. This way, if anybody wants to blow the whistle, they'll blow it on you, not me. I tried to get her to move out of this neighbourhood years ago. Wanted her to have a fancy apartment over on Lake Shore Drive. She wouldn't have any part of it. She's lived here ever since she was married. Saw her kids born here, my old man die. All her friends are here. Markets, church. She wouldn't feel at home anyplace else. Just so she's happy, that's all that counts. That's the way I figure it. Wait till ya see the apartment. Hasn't changed since I was a kid. Here. Get yourself some candy. Come on, let's split it. See that corner? They call it "Death Corner". I used to hang out there when I was a young punk itching to make something of myself. There were more killings there with shivs and guns in the twenties and thirties than any spot in this town. That's where I first saw the big boys. Capone, O'Banion, Big Jim Colosimo. I'm the last of the old mob, Barry, only because I learned from the boners they made. Come a long way, eh? That's the window to my old lady's apartment. When I was a kid, I used to yell up, "Hey, Ma, throw me down two cents." Big deal. Buy jawbreakers and Tootsie Rolls. - Hey, Ma! - Yeah, Louis? Throw me down a dime, will ya? All the kids got 'em. Oh! Ah! Inflation. Come on. Detective Lieutenant Fenton, please. - Arnie! - Hi! How you feeling, Mama? I'm fine, Arnie, fine. Come in, come in. I want you to meet a friend of mine, Barry Amsterdam. Oh, I'm always happy to meet a friend of Arnie's. How do you do, Mrs Valent? Well, I haven't seen you for a long time. Why didn't you let me know you were coming? I would've made something special for you. I can't stay very long, Mama. I just wanted to see how you were and pick up that book I left here. Oh, well, you go ahead. I'll make some coffee. Excuse me. Oh, now, son, take off your coat - and make yourself at home. - Oh, thank you. What's he doing at Maxwell and Peoria? - His mother still lives there. - I didn't know he had one. Here you are, Barry. I'll talk to the old lady while you look this over. Arnie, this is so simple, a kid could follow it. That's why I want you to keep the same system so I can make heads or tails of it. Complicated bookkeeping throws me. Arnie tells me you're a college graduate. I wanted Arnie to go to college too. How we could have afforded it, I don't know, but we would have managed somehow. But Arnie didn't want it. Suppose I had gone to college, Mom. I might have become an accountant like Barry here. This way I can afford to pay an accountant to work for me. Ah, your son does pretty good, Mrs Valent. I know. Can I show you something, Mr Amsterdam? - Come on, I'll show you. - Sure. Come on. Look at what I have to show you. This is Arnie when he was confirmed. Would you believe it? No, I wouldn't. And this is Arnie when he graduated from public school. There, that one. Oh, it's not hard to pick him out, is it? Oh, I've heard some bad stories about Arnie, but I don't believe them. I know my son. And I know he wouldn't do anything bad... Really bad. Now, you run and see if Arnie's letting that coffee get burned. You go ahead, and I'll come after you. - Arnie? - Yeah, Barry. Arnie, what did you do with the... Well, now that you know how I want ours kept... Why don't you go into the living room? I'll have coffee ready for you in a minute. - Okay, Ma. - Oh, go on, son. Join Arnie. Who can that be? I wasn't expecting anyone. - Probably Nate. - Yeah, I'll... I'll get it. Just a minute! He burned it! He burned it! What goes, Fenton? - You know him? - All my life. He's a detective. A lieutenant detective. Detective? I thought he was a hood. Just goes to show, you can't tell the difference. When he tried to push past me, I thought he was going for you. What's the matter? What's happened? It's nothing, Ma. It's all right, you go inside. I wanna talk to these boys out here. - What's your name? - Amsterdam. Barry Amsterdam. I heard. Crooked tax boy who made good in a bad way. Take it easy, Fenton. What do you expect when you come busting in here? Yeah, did you say you were a cop? Did you show a search warrant? - Let go of me. - It's all right, boys. What am I supposed to do? Let everyone who wants push up to Arnie? What do you want, Fenton? I, uh, just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Mel Burke. Well, what about him? We found the gun used on Kern. The bullets matched, and we traced it to Burke. We thought you might know where he was. What did you have to come here for and scare the life out of his old lady? You know where he lives. Why didn't you go there? We did. He wasn't home. So we put out a call and his car was spotted downstairs. You passed the question, Valent. I said where's Burke? I haven't seen him in more than a year. Maybe you'd like to tell us. Maybe you'd like to buy one of our life insurance policies. You might get killed going down those stairs. All right, we'll find him. And when we do, we're gonna have a couple more questions to ask you, Valent. Anytime at all, Fenton, except announce yourself next time, huh? You pull another trick like this, and I'll break your head wide open. Come on, fellas. I've been wanting to do that all my life. Never had the guts. On the very same night, Joyce came to see Barry with all the data she could find that belonged to her father. Barry knew that police had picked up Burke in Florida and had started extradition proceedings. The papers Joyce brought were meaningless until Barry came to one in particular. A receipt made out to Nelson Kern from the Melrose Microfilm Company. Fourteen dollars and sixty cents for microfilming. What was that for? I wondered about that one myself. But I thought many accounting firms might use microfilm to record papers. Yes, that's true, there's a lot of business reasons. Except that this was made out to your father personally, not the firm of Kern Associates. And it was paid for with cash. Why? The next morning, Joyce went down to the Melrose Microfilm Company. I have a receipt here made out to Mr Kern for some microfilming. Was it ever picked up? Well, now, let's see. Uh-huh. K... K... K-A, K-E... Kern. Here it is. Oh, uh... This was picked up quite some time ago. Did Mr Kern pick it up himself? No... No, it was a young lady. She said she was Mr Kern's secretary. The reason I remember, urn... Well, she was also very attractive. Would you remember what it was that Mr Kern had microfilmed? Well, yes, it, uh, was a ledger. Several hundred pages, for which we charge two cents a page. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Miss Becker, Nelson Kern's secretary, had quickly been summoned to Lieutenant Detective Fenton's office for questioning based on the information Joyce Kern uncovered. Miss Becker knew nothing about any microfilm, but Fenton now knew why Kern was killed. And he could almost put his finger on the person who picked up the microfilm. To make certain, he sent Joyce back there with a photo. The clerk at Melrose Microfilm was quick to recognise a photo of Connie as the girl who called for the envelope addressed to Mr Kern. That night, I sneaked up to Barry's apartment with Joyce Kern. The knowledge that Connie had picked up the microfilm spelled a dead end for Barry. Feeling that he had nothing else to go on, he wanted to call it quits. All right, so we know who picked it up. What good does that do? If we could find it, we could prove that he's... Do you think Valent is stupid enough to hang onto that? That microfilm could cause an explosion bigger than the H-bomb. Take it from me, it's nothing but ashes now. It's no use, Dave. We're... We're bush leaguers compared to them. Isn't there something else we can do? Well, you tell me. Everywhere I turn, I hit a stone wall. All right, so I am finally a partner of sort, even keep Valent's books. But they're in my name. If anybody finds them, he stays in the clear and I end up a crook! What do you want me to do? Put the finger on myself? - Wait for the breaks. - What breaks? The way Valent plays it, he's got things plugged so tight, there are no breaks. I'm serious, Dave. Forget it. I know when I'm licked. - Who is it? - Nate. Just a minute. - Ah, what brings you here? - Arnie sent me over. He tried to get you earlier. No dice. Yeah, well... I was out for a while. What does he want? He decided to throw a little party to celebrate that new partnership that you and... What? - Who's in there? - No-one. I thought I heard some talking on the way up. I said, no-one! Why didn't you tell me? Don't I have any private life of my own any more? Now I know why you didn't even answer the phone. I'll tell Arnie. Meet us at the Tropicana. You know, it's funny. Arnie told me to ask you to bring that trick along. He goes for her. See ya. Thanks, Joyce. For a minute there, I thought... This could be the break we wanted, Barry. You said that you thought Connie had something on him. You mean, use Joyce to make Connie mad enough to talk, is that it? It's our only chance. I heard him say Valent's attracted to her. Well, not in exactly those words. How about it, Joyce? You willing to be used to do a little green-eyed needling? What do you want me to do? You remember Miss Morton, Arnie? Of course. Couldn't forget her. Glad you could come. I'm so happy to see you again, Mr Valent. - You know everyone. - I believe so. Pardon me. I didn't mean to sit so close. - Couldn't be close enough. - Oh, brother. Why aren't you up there, Chico? Long ago, I found out they do very well without this stick. But this stick without them? Nothing. Barry... Excuse me, boys. Miss Morton. What are you drinking, Barry? Oh, I'm drinking Stingers. I'll have another one. Ginger ale. Nate told me about, uh... Oh, he did. Nate's got a pretty big mouth. One of these days, I'm gonna put my fist in it. That's what I like about you, Barry. You're a gentleman, you never talk. I admire that. You didn't bring me up here just to tell me what a gentleman I am, did you, Arnie? No. It's a touchy subject. This partnership... I was wondering if we could spread it a little to have you cut me in on something of yours. - What about Connie? - Do you like her? - She does nothing to me. - Me neither. There was a time, though. You see, Miss Morton may not be a lady, but she acts like one. Connie isn't a lady and doesn't act like one. Connie's a bomb. Thing like this could cause her to explode. She knows a lot, Arnie. Suppose you let me worry about that? All right. You can wrap it up and take it home. Thanks. This time, why don't you just try climbing into his lap? I would but you're already there. And I'm staying there. You might as well understand that. Say, uh... How does she feel about me? Personally, I mean. You'll have no trouble making the grade. Good. Arnie's always telling me, "Barry's girl is such a lady." Lady, my foot! Well, by comparison... Ooh! Sugar and cream? Why, you dirty... Knock it off! Knock it off! From what I saw, you had it coming. Come on, Connie. Change for your new number. Quick. Andre! Clean this up. ♪ Cuban mambo, take it away ♪ Cuban mambo, ai-ai-ai-ai ♪ Cuban mambo... ♪ Hiya, Connie. Come on, sit down, join the leftovers. - Where did Arnie go? - Quick switch, honey. But I'm really not such a bad guy, until after you get to know me better. What kind of man are you, letting him walk off with your girl? What kind of woman are you, letting her walk off with your man? I wasn't here to stop them! Come on. Cut it out, honey. He's finished with you. Through, done with, kaput. And there's nothing you or I can do about it. Well, maybe there's nothing you can do about it, - but there's plenty I can do. - Give me a for-instance. I'll save it for Arnie. Don't worry, bright boy, you'll soon have her right back in your hair. Like dandruff. Want me to stick around, drive you home? Thanks, but Chico knows where I live. Good old puppy-dog Chico. Still hanging around with his tail wagging. For a week, Connie tried to get in touch with Valent. Every time she called, Barry was on the other end. You're wasting a fortune in dimes, Connie. No, no, he's out with Sue. How would I know when he's coming back? It doesn't matter anyhow, he's not home to you. Look, do me a favour, will ya, honey? Don't call anymore. Who was that? The ex-girlfriend. Can't you smell the tamale burning? She's beginning to be a nuisance. You'd imagine she'd have learned by now. Nobody learns without a lesson first. Why don't you teach her one, Barry? Sort of spell it out for her, easy-like. Well, it's a little out of my department, but, uh, I'll see what kind of a teacher I could be. Oh, uh, don't miss me too much. - Hasta mañana, baby. - Good night, Chico. I've been waiting for you, Connie. - I've got something to tell you. - Save it. Oh, now, don't be like that. I came here to do you a favour. What kind of a favour? Stop hounding Arnie. Forget him. Lay off. Don't phone, don't threaten. Forget he lives, otherwise... Otherwise? You can take it from there, can't you? Why are you telling me this? Call it affinity. As one discard to the other. You know, the cord that binds between cast-offs. You not only let him walk off with your girl, but now you're acting his watchdog. How low can you get? Well, now, if you hang around, you might find out. As far as I'm concerned, you've already hit bottom. Scared the girdle off her. Fenton ought to give me a medal for this. - You all right? You okay? - Let me alone! Tell Arnie that if he ever tries that again, or if I'm ever found dead, the DA's gonna get a letter that'll blow Arnie higher than he just tried to blow me! Come on, get in the car. Get in the car. Why, Arnie, I thought you didn't wanna see me again, and here you practically force me to come. Miss me, huh? Hello, Arnie. Connie, you oughta know me pretty well by now... - Too well. - Don't interrupt. You oughta know that I don't frighten easily, - and I don't like to be threat... - Chico, fix me a drink. Shut up and listen! You can tell the honeymoon's over, can't you? Someday he may even talk to you this way. He may even try to have you knocked off, like he did me. You told me to teach her a lesson. I tried talking, she wouldn't listen, so I had a couple of the boys throw a scare at her. Well, I can throw a few scares myself. If you ever try that again... I'll do the talking. Now what's this about a letter to the DA? You know a letter's no good unless you can prove what's in it. Well, according to a lawyer I spoke to, microfilm is, uh... To use his words... Now what did he say? Hmm. Oh, yes, "primary evidence". That's what he said, "primary evidence". - You're lying. - Don't test it. You told me you burned it the minute you got out of the store. I lied then, but I'm not lying now. Do you think I don't know what happened to those meaty young kids you played around with before you met me? When you had your fill, you shipped them off, and nobody ever heard a word from them again. I knew this, and I wasn't gonna let you bounce me around that way, so I kept the microfilm. Better than life insurance, huh, Arnie? Now you gotta make sure that I live, otherwise you don't live either. You're making this up. Like to find out? Get rid of me. Try it. Where is it, Connie? Don't make me laugh. Where is it, Connie? You'll never get it from me, never. Not even if you kill me, and you won't do that. You can't afford to. Maybe you'll be almost glad I did before I'm through with you. - Arnie, don't! - Are you still carrying a torch? Then get her to talk if you want her back in one piece. - Connie, tell him. Please. - Stay out of this, Chico! You'd better get a new singer, Chico. Connie won't be able to appear in public for a while. Arnie, don't. Leave her alone. I'll tell, but leave her alone. You'll tell! You know? Well, she gave me something to keep for her. She said that if anything should ever happen to her, to mail it to the District Attorney. But I didn't know what it was till just now. Honest, I didn't. Where is it? In my violin case, in the rosin box, in the case I keep at Marchi's, the music shop. Hold it, boys. The stuff's at some music shop. What's the address? 131 Cleveland Street. Chico, you didn't! You didn't! Can't you see what you've done? You've killed me. I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it. You know how I feel about you. I couldn't sit here and listen to you screaming. I was taking it, not you, and if I didn't talk... Oh, you fool! You gutless, frightened little fool! Oh, please, Connie, please. I couldn't help it. - I just couldn't help it. - Take us there. I can't. I can't. I feel sick. Well, go telephone 'em and tell 'em we're coming. Hello, Marchi? Chico. A Mr Valent will come down to get my violin case. You know the one, the spare one you're holding for me. Give it to him. No, I... I can't come down myself, I'm too busy. Adiós. Hugo. You wait here till I come back. Hugo will keep you company. Barry. I'm sick. I'm sick. I'm really sick. Some coffee, Hugo, please. I think we could all stand some. Detective Lieutenant Fenton. Hurry! Detective Fenton, this is Joyce... Hello, hello, hello... Let me go! Hello, hello... Go on, tell him. Tell him! I don't care if they kill Arnie. I want them to kill him. Tell him! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, are you still there? I'm Valent. Chico called you? Yes, Mr Valent. I have it ready for you. Get that basket. You got a match? Burn it. What's the tunnel used for? We use it to deliver merchandise from one department store to another. Don't have to buck street traffic. Also to get rid of the trash and that sort of stuff. There's forty miles of it, but only three openings. Where are they? Cleveland, Halsted and Ohio. You two go down after them. You take Halsted and we'll take Ohio. Drop it, Arnie! Arnie! Arnie! Call an ambulance. - How did you know? - Joyce. Arnie... Arnie. Oh, Arnie. My boy. My boy. Oh, my... Mama. Oh, my boy. Oh, Arnie. The information contained on the microfilm was turned over to the various law enforcement agencies, who moved in with a vengeance. Everyone incriminated was picked up, tried and convicted, and the syndicate was cracked wide open. For how long it will remain so is a matter for constant civic vigilance in our city as well as yours.
