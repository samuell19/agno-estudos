Nurse Can you please raise the bed up? I want to see my leg Don't worry The diagnosis report will include photos We will provide you a copy What the hell is that? Don't pretend politeness and speak so impolitely My husband just wants to see his leg What's that to do with photos? Excuse me Mrs. Zheng. Can I have a word? Mr. Zheng's condition was untreated for too long If we don't amputate there's a risk of death Amputate? Is there no other way? Mrs. Zheng This is something I've had to tell many patients' families Keep the leg and lose your life or keep your life and lose the leg If you feel uncomfortable let us know anytime We can give you drugs to let you sleep through it Alright? I'm fine I'll stay awake Great While you're awake let me explain the details Usually our amputation surgery employs this electric saw In one second, it vibrates 1,000 times But I personally feel it doesn't cut well It's not smooth So Today we're using this stainless steel saw It cuts great Very smooth We'll be using this saw to assist you today If it's fine with you, we will begin Here, scalpel Doctor Put me to sleep after all midazolam 5mg Here, Mr. Zheng Please think back to something pleasant Let's count to ten Something pleasant One Honestly speaking all pleasant things are in the past a past that is often disappearing It's only when I feel pain and reluctance that I learn what the pleasant things actually were Life always seems to be that way We are like train passengers watching scenery In the moment, you think the scenery isn't beautiful But once you travel further away You realize we've already passed the beauty We can only carry the sorrow and remember If the bed… If there aren't enough beds this week -Ask for some from General Surgery -Dr. Gao. I received a critical condition alert Wait a moment - Wait? - If there aren't... Why'd you tell me to come immediately? I was performing, I couldn't even change clothes Calm down first Mr. Zheng's septicemia is more serious than anticipated Dr. Gao said your condition isn't good He said you need to intubate He said if you intubate there's a very high chance you'll never wake up But if you don't intubate you won't live past tonight Zi-han Will you intubate? What do you mean my granny loves getting sick? No It's serious I mean this time it's really serious Can you not be like this? Let's use the elevator. I'm at the hospital, come see for yourself I'm saying I'll… I'll call you later Miss, let me help Mr. Zheng, we're getting in the ambulance May I ask if you're religious? Mrs. Zheng Are you religious? What he means is when we get to the funeral home the ambulance plays music for the deceased If you're Christian we'll play a hymn For Buddhists, it's scripture Is there dance music? We have a dance version of the Great Compassion Mantra Brother Open your eyes Does this lady's manner and dress look like she listens to the Great Compassion Mantra? You should play a waltz or something You mean like the Blue Danube? Thank you We meet by chance It was a simple favor As you climb a thousand peaks Godspeed Brother Brother Please turn the car around I want to go back to the hospital I want to go back to the hospital I don't know what love at first sight means I only remember the first time I saw you I was pulled hypnotically into your world John Color Photography Do you still remember my senior high classmate John? The first time I knew you was at his photo studio Besides the shutter and aperture photography requires two perceptive eyes But that's still only the level of the common photographer I also possess a heart that is unlike others This photo feels so natural You know her? This is a photo studio not a dating service I was only thinking she's so beautiful she must have someone already Unfortunately she does not Well? Should I introduce you? You know my character I don't get close to others so easily Her name is Yu-ying Qian She's an only child She won the folk dance competition in junior high I also won a writing competition in junior high Is dancing related to writing? Of course not But we're both champions Want to come closer? You're soaked I'm fine I'm used to it and we've only just met Miss Qian I don't know if I may have the honor of asking you be to my dance partner? I don't know if you have that honor But I can give it some consideration Of course "Waltz" in German means "to turn" Men and women dancing Heads in the heavens Feet upon the earth Rotating about each other Supporting each other's bodies In the midst of endless turning I truly realized You were the dance partner I was searching for Ladies and gentlemen Next up will be the International Amateur Modern Dance Finals First team Let's welcome Number 227 Zi-han Zheng Yu-ying Qian Soon after, we joined an important international competition Although we didn't win the championship the applause of the packed crowd filled us with confidence for the future This all happened in the brief time since we met I scarcely believed happiness could come so easily So easily that I started to doubt what happiness was I'm going to ask you three questions You have to answer honestly Absolutely honest Am I your perfect dance partner? Do you need to ask? Then will you take me to Blackpool Dance Festival? No doubt Are you serious about me? Is this a proposal? Then you have to tell me what's the benefit of marrying you That's four questions Besides my warm personality and good looks I have something no other men have What? My mom died over a decade ago If you marry me You'll never have mother-in-law problems How old are you? This year 28 Who else is in your family? Only my father is left now Only your father Your father. What's his work? Mom Let me go cut some fruit Take your time Mom, I'll come with you May the country and the people stay strong Kao Wan Miss, what's the matter? I'm looking for Dr. Gao Dr. Gao's shift has ended You're that Mrs. Zheng I was Mrs. Zheng Now I'm Miss Qian Miss Qian Dr. Gao's shift really is over Get me a doctor of the same seniority as Dr. Gao to help me Okay. Please wait for me We need a little help Right. Thank you Are these senior doctors? Why are they dressed like doormen? Miss. Is there an issue? What's all this? Are you surrounding me to intimidate me? No one's intimidating you We just want to understand the issue at hand here My husband died three hours ago He was amputated before he died I only wanted to come retrieve his leg Our hospital follows a fixed protocol Therefore, please go home and wait for a notice - A notice? - Tomorrow... -My husband's lying -I'll call for a meeting to help... in the ambulance downstairs Is it so hard to give me an answer now? You're determined to stay Give me the leg We'll call the police Officer This woman's been making a scene It's seriously disturbing peace in the ward No, no I wasn't called in for this The call was for adverse possession of property Officer I made the call You move quick I called before I came upstairs Who called the police? About someone making a scene at the hospital? Our hospital called you Rookie, shouldn't you be on drunk-driving patrol? What are you doing here? Old-timer Shouldn't you be in a bar squeezing Vietnamese chicks? What brings you here? Look at the balls on you Balls so big you're tripping over them Senior Please be more professional I'm currently on duty Miss Please show your ID What ID? I got here first Let me finish talking Miss May I ask what happened to put you in so much pain? When my husband stayed in the hospital the doctor told me he needed to amputate If he didn't amputate, there was a risk of death I had no choice in the end I let them saw off the leg Three hours ago He died I know this hospital is full of medical malpractice But life and death are ruled by fate I don't blame them I really don't blame them I just want to ask if they can return that leg to me and reunite it with his body But they're not even willing to look and want me to go home and wait Senior They've gone too far Junior. Calm down Let's clear up the situation first Messy Hair Is what the lady said true? No, no We never said we wouldn't look It's just the time is so late We can't do anything right now Why've you been trying to brush me off? I've been matter-of-fact Do I look like I'm brushing you off? Even your hair looks like it's brushing me off Officer You can't just one-sidedly believe her Isn't she making a scene right now? Senior You believe what Messy Hair's saying? Whether she's making a scene or not you need to have more empathy and understanding for families -Officer -Let's go Officer -You're kidding -Senior You're kidding - Senior... - You're kidding - Didn't you... - Senior, no Didn't you say we need empathy? Officer Officer Why am I the one handcuffed? Miss We sympathize deeply with your loss But in our official duties if you continued making a scene at a hospital we'd have a problem Senior What should we do now? Junior Isn't it obvious? By our official duties we need to remove her from the scene Didn't we do that? And we did it brilliantly But after leaving the crime scene She escaped custody We pursued without success We both witnessed it Officer What should I do now? Junior In this situation what would you do? Senior I'd like to hear your ideas In the hospital The people who breathe stay on the 1st floor and above Those who don't breathe stay in the basement To find that leg you'd go to the basement Where would the leg be? Wouldn't you know by checking the records? It's that simple I'm telling this only to you No one else is listening I'm listening Who are you? I'm an ambulance driver Can I help you? Mr. Zheng's body is still in my car Go You can enter the venue That day was a very important day After today we'd have a chance to compete in England But I didn't show up I know you must have been very hurt I should start explaining from the day before the competition Fuck. This guy's badass. His company went bankrupt but he took his last dollars to the casino Classmate Capa is my idol The coolest thing isn't how many war photos he took It's that he was tall and handsome Elegant as fuck Tons of girls Is that so? And he had a quote. If your pictures aren't good enough you aren't close enough What's that mean? It means if your photos aren't good enough that means you're too far from the action I knew it That's great John You know the biggest lesson I got from this book? What? I've got ten grand on me Do you know where I can turn this into twenty grand? Some say, you can climb your whole life and fall in an instant Once you start down a crooked path the gates of hell open wide I remember soon after coming here as those false casino chips piled before me I realized how foolish my step-by-step efforts seemed I thought I could buy you a car We could buy a house A house with many rooms Full of our children When I came out I had not only twice what I entered with But five times Almost twenty times more Altogether 1.83 million Thank you, I don't smoke These are for people who don't smoke Sir, what do you do? Ballroom dancing Ballroom dance Did you know? I also love ballroom dance I didn't know First time here Yeah Incredible Winning so much your first time Just luck Want to play again? Play what? Texas hold 'em Here? Of course not Interested? I'm busy later No problem If you're busy, you can go You can barely fit the money in your bag Want a new bag? No. This one's fine Young man What's your name? My surname's Zheng Mr. Zheng This is my card You'll be back in two days This must cost five, six thousand Don't worry We'll perform tomorrow Think of this as an early celebration Why do you seem strange? Do I? You do You seem elsewhere Yes My mind was elsewhere Because I was thinking about the man in the casino saying "You'll be back in two days" I didn't need two days I wanted to go right now Deal. Sign here Leave your ID cards here In three days, put down six million for this check Grand Hotel Presidential Suite Grand Hotel Presidential Suite After leaving the casino, I didn't know where to go But my legs brought me unthinkingly to the contest venue When I arrived I saw you still waiting alone for me I suddenly felt ashamed Why did I return for you? I should go wander the earth change my name and forget you forever I hid in a rural motel for three, four days Time was slow Like the world had stopped How are you doing? I'd rather not think about it Hello? Young man. Want some company? No Grandma May I ask you Is there someone here named Zheng? Handsome guy staying here No Only Chen Chen? Think back again He just called my friend telling me to deliver his money here No No? You're speaking carelessly When I asked neighbors, they said he was here The neighbors wouldn't know -Think carefully -That's right. Think carefully His mother asked us to deliver money That's right. We aren't messing around Let us look upstairs Save us the trouble we're just delivering money No I'm not lying Why did the auntie next door say he was here? She didn't say She doesn't know him Grandma Can I use your bathroom? I'm telling you. There's no bathroom upstairs There's no bathroom upstairs Jumping was the stupidest thing I ever did in my life I destroyed myself and destroyed our future When I awoke, I saw a teardrop on your cheek I wanted to tell you many things but besides the guilt in my heart I couldn't say anything If time could return to that moment I would tell you I'm sorry Tell you I only wanted to be with you Only wanted you to live happily But I didn't know such a simple thing could be so hard Thinking back now For the two of us, this was both the worst and our best moment The next day, you brought me to your home I kneeled in front of your parents Not because I was asking for six million dollars but out of deep remorse not to mention I had married their daughter without notifying them All right Stop kneeling Let's eat Room 97 I'm looking for Dr. Gao Our outpatient hours are over It's fine, let her in You're still after the same thing, right? Yes, Dr. Gao I'm still after the same thing From our hospital's perspective everything belongs to the patients including medical records or the patient's parts or organs Those are all patients' We have no reason to hold them So you making a scene yesterday was actually pointless Dr. Gao I only want my husband's leg returned I know This Taiwanese custom of burying the body intact or whatever I don't believe in it Dr. Gao I only want my husband's leg returned Hello. Pathology? This is Dr. Gao Can you help me find a Mr. Zheng's pathology report? Okay. Thank you I'll wait for your call I'm going to eat I'll come with you What for? I don't know when I'll see you again Am I disturbing your meal? Yes It's better if you sit Thank you This is my first time eating with a patient's family With a dead man's family too You've got humor I'm a sensible person I feel like you and your husband didn't get along too well Why do you say that? I saw his medical record He was sick for a long time But seems like no one looked after him Sorry I shouldn't have asked Hello Pathology Okay Got it Miss Qian, this is Director Yang Our hospital forbids non-employees from entering But I told them about you So when they're done here hurry up and take your husband's leg Mr. Zheng's specimen is B503482 44382 Second shelf Sorry Is there an issue? B503482 Right? Right Second shelf Can't find it Check every shelf Okay What the hell Why aren't things put where they should be? Director What's going on? These two days' specimens should all be on this shelf The specimens we sent down should have slides Of course I don't get what you're saying What specimen slides? What's that mean? Your husband's cut-off leg is called a specimen Slices of a specimen are put into glass slides So you're saying my husband's leg vanished and changed into glass? Your husband's leg wouldn't change into glass I think maybe there were problems when it was being delivered What problems? Yeah, what problems? Director, I want to know too We sent the specimen from Surgery directly to Pathology If there's a problem, it's with Pathology Don't throw blame left and right, Director I'm not throwing blame, just clarifying Technician Wang Bring me the past few days' forms Okay Yes It's July 5 Sent directly from Surgery We signed it But Miss Qian Before your husband was operated on you already signed the consent form What consent form? The consent form asked you if you wanted to keep the specimen You checked "No" Are you not giving it to me because you can't find it or are you not giving it to me because I signed "No"? Is there a difference? Of course it's different I want it back now Have you eaten at a restaurant before? What about it? When you finish chewing a chicken bone and the waiter cleans your table and asks you if he can clear away your chicken bones you say "Yes" after he's taken them you turn and tell him to bring the bones back you want to chew it more you want to taste it again Does that seem right to you? Thank you Dr. Gao I could no longer dance The day the doctor told us we were both very quiet To comfort me you cut the hair you'd been growing for twenty years and told me you didn't want to compete either We searched for a place to teach dance lessons Fortunately Your dad, besides paying my debt also provided us a classroom He even lent us money At first we hesitated Did we need such a big classroom? But in the end, we reserved it This was not only where we danced To save money we also lived here Learn ballroom dancing easily During that time, I witnessed many different lifestyles I realized how living wasn't easy I started to worry about our future Hello This is our new ballroom dance studio Please visit if you have time - Hello. - Hello. This is our new ballroom dance studio Please visit if you have time See our classes on the back I'm sore here -Here -Yeah Good work You had it tough, running around outside You had it tougher Zi-han I heard a joke today What joke? There's a bird couple on a treetop Below the tree is a flock of grazing sheep Suddenly one of the sheep slips and falls The bird wife says "Husband It's wet down there!" Are you flirting with me? That joke's so old Then have you heard the one about the frog and the kangaroo? One day, a frog and a kangaroo went to a brothel In a short time the kangaroo came back out He heard the frog in the next room "One two three hey" "One two three hey" "One two three hey" The kangaroo was envious and thought "Wow" The next day The kangaroo met the frog and asked him Brother Frog You're amazing, going all night. The frog told the kangaroo "Shit." "I jumped all night and couldn't land on the bed." Zi-han Aren't you worried? Worried about what? We have so few students No It'll get better Is there something unsettled between us? No Something just reminded me of you I wonder if I could ask a favor What is it? I recently opened a dance studio with my wife Business is slow I remember you said you liked dancing You stopped dancing? I think if you like to dance my wife is really a good teacher I believe you also have many friends who dance If you don't mind give us a try When people reach a dead end they'll dig any hole to escape That's the situation that made me ask Mr. Chen from the casino He promised nothing But in a few weeks students gradually increased Today, two more The next day, four The students seemed refined Not covered in tattoos Most had their own dance partner The classroom became more crowded You were happily busy and even hired an assistant Keep smiling Dance Presentation Later, I called Mr. Chen to thank him He didn't take my calls after that Long ago, someone told me Life is rarely smooth sailing As soon as you ride one wave you need to race for the next one Only those who seize their chance can create their own turning points Come on! My first turning point after the classroom's success was the foreclosed home - Can I help you? - I'm the homeowner - The homeowner? - The homeowner? The tenant is over there Take it easy The homeowner - It's my turn now. - It's my turn now. Boss The homeowner Mr. Homeowner, hello I'm the tenant. Make yourself at home No This house I bought it Are you all moving out? Did you bring it yet? It is the… Relocation fee No I already bought this house How could there be a relocation fee? Young man You don't know the unspoken rules? What rules? You can look it up online Where online? Ask Brother Google House roaches" What do you know about foreclosed homes? I did my research There're two types One with handover, one without No handover is cheaper I bought one with no handover So it… How much did you pay? 8 million How much do they want? 2.5 million What's the market value? 10 million How many people do they have? About ten You're dressed so neatly and brought a gift I thought you were polite but your relocation fee is even less than your husband's We only have this much If you don't take it and don't move I still can't give you the number you want If anyone knew I took such a small amount how could I show my face in society? - Fuck you, you wanna die? - Fuck you, you wanna die? How can we show our face? - Fuck you, you wanna die? - Fuck you, you wanna die? Brother Bringing so many friends here each day must cost a lot It's like a choir in here I really don't have that much money If you take it and leave One day, I'll sell this house make a lot of money and gift it to you In this business we'll be seeing more of each other Brother If we can treat each other like friends wouldn't that be better? Yu-ying If we got into the foreclosure business the two of us wouldn't it be like The Return of the Condor Heroes? The Return of the Condor Heroes? The guy lost his arm The girl was raped Have you even read that book? Miss Qian You can't keep following me This is our place of work I must ask you to leave Because of you, I didn't finish my lunch I have more surgeries this afternoon Can you have mercy? I can wait here until your surgery's over What'll you do when my surgery's over? Didn't you sign the form saying you waived the specimen? I need to get my husband's leg back I need his leg before he's buried I'm an orthopedic doctor but the doctor you need is a psychiatrist Ask for Qian Wang, B2 Is Qian Wang here? -He's next door -Next door Non-contaminated area, Staffs, Forbidden entry Non-contaminated area, Staffs, Forbidden entry Is Qian Wang here? -He's downstairs -Downstairs Mr. Wang Are you Mr. Wang? Dr. Gao asked me to find you What is it? My husband was amputated But he died soon after I want to retrieve his leg Dr. Gao told me to find you Go ask Pathology Pathology couldn't find it Mr. Wang Mr. Wang Don't follow me Mr. Wang -Mr. Wang -Enough Mr. Wang, can you help me? Please Mr. Wang When was his surgery? 44382 Only two days ago According to hospital regulations amputated specimens are kept at Pathology for at least two weeks When did he pass away? Yesterday Yesterday Be careful Your husband is still active in this world seeing his friends listening to them He could even be talking to you You simply can't hear it Right now you must avoid dishonesty and deceit Let me ask Did you sign the consent form waiving the specimen? Then you should stand by what you've said But they didn't follow hospital procedure either and lost it You can't use others' faults to ignore your own faults So what should I do? What should you do? Go home Arrange your husband's affairs Forget that leg Dr. Gao didn't send me here to hear you say this Miss I'm just a janitor How should I know what Dr. Gao wanted me to tell you? Pathology must have seen your waiver and sent it down directly But you regret it now Mr. Wang You look like you understand the world more than the doctors and nurses upstairs Do you know why we regret things? Miss You don't need to split us into upstairs-downstairs Everyone has done and understands different things Let me ask Why do you regret it? I signed the waiver because after my husband was amputated we could still spend many decades together Compared to those years together that leg isn't worth anything I never thought he'd be gone immediately That was your vision not necessarily his Mr. Wang All the stuff sent from Pathology gets piled up here Usually, on Fridays a medical waste truck comes to pick it up But it just came by three days ago so if your husband's leg came down in the past two days you have a chance What if I don't find it? If you don't find it it'll go to a medical waste disposal plant and be incinerated within 84 hours Incinerated in 84 hours? Incinerated in 84 hours All their trucks have GPS Whether they're eating or shitting our computers monitor it so they can't trick us You want to search? Yes Okay. Put these on, then What are these for? You'll know in a moment Do you have new ones? Cleaner ones? You think we are a department store? When you go in, I won't join you When you go in, you'll see Yellow bags and red bags Don't look inside the yellow bags Those are recycled You can look into the red bags When you open them you'll see many small bags Never open the small bags They're filled with formalin Even if it doesn't splash on you if you breathe too much we'll be holding a double funeral for husband and wife Then how do I search? By touch Feel the bags by shape and size and you'll know What? I'll slap your ass. You're not afraid? I'm afraid You're not afraid? I'm afraid But she took the kids to compete She won't be back until late Louder Don't stop Don't stop! Don't stop. Get the fuck out Did you use my bed? It's not what you think Did you? No I suspected this for a long time I just didn't want to believe it You only wash my feet telling me lewd jokes I was so naive flirting along with your jokes You laugh like I'm nothing But with other women? You said it's not what I think What is it then? John Color Photography John Color Photography John Color Photography John Color Photography This photo is of a couple who came here for a wedding photo after the notary I was even their witness None of their families and friends came It was a somewhat cold scene But though it was a bit sad I still captured their smiles The two gazing into the distance From their expressions the distance doesn't seem so far away I also feel honored to have known this couple This was a really good shot Good shots don't sell anymore Photo studios now are all run by uneducated middle-aged women who only know how to say "Come on. Lift your head" "Yes. Smile" The people in their photos all smile like idiots How's your dance studio? Great And the wife? Also great After that incident You didn't mention divorce You kept the dance studio going But you moved out Besides teaching in the classroom you started teaching in the dance hall The dance hall had good male dancers You would share a moment of happiness I used to think dance was all about the steps raising your hands, turning These past few years I slowly realized dance is not only the posture It is the spilling of emotion It is love and hate Anger and sorrow I had this realization only after I stopped dancing Director Yang It was so cold that I felt faint and got confused Let me try again I'll find it for sure this time Miss Qian You've already broken our hospital rules Technically speaking, we can't help you open these bags All I can do is let you to take one bag back to your husband Director Yang Are you trying to get in my way? Women shouldn't be hard on women Miss Qian You don't need to tell me these outdated feminist slogans I peer down a microscope every day You can't tell men from women under the microscope President President The secretary told me today about this matter I was very shocked Director Yang. How long have you been working at this hospital? About 15 years How could such a huge mistake occur? This family's in so much pain Isn't it our physician's duty to relieve the people's suffering? President When my husband was hospitalized I did sign the amputation waiver But now I regret it I want it back I want to return it to his body No problem You don't need to explain Life is long We all have some regrets But truthfully speaking even if we get your husband's leg back and reattach it it wouldn't do much good After all, it's been severed and soaked in chemicals Wouldn't you agree? Speaking for all my hospital colleagues we offer our deepest apologies Forget this leg I'll get you a trunk of the finest wood and make you the best prosthetic leg Truthfully Yesterday, my colleagues informed me of your situation I wanted to find time to speak with you But my morning was busy. I forgot But I privately called my sculptor friend in the mountains I asked him to reserve wood that was intended to carve the goddess Guanyin That wood is from a century-old temple that renovated its beams Very beautiful Very rare If you don't mind we'll use this wood to carve a leg for Mr. Zheng and fulfill your wish Mr. Zhu -Thanks for your work -Hello This is Miss Qian Miss Qian welcome Miss Qian We took photos from Pathology of your husband's leg to make a 3D model for Mr. Zhu so he can sculpt custom measurements The pathology photos were swollen and black before amputation Yes Mr. Zhu is a famous artist He only needs to see a 3D model to recreate in his mind your husband's leg when it was healthy We can complete it tomorrow And then your husband's leg toenails, skin will all be precisely represented It will look brand new President. Miss Qian is here Director Yang is here too President, I'm here representing Pathology for Mr. Zhang's leg You can smell the aroma If this wasn't accompanying your husband's body I'd want to keep it here as an art display This leg looks more like my husband's leg than my husband's leg Beautiful Really beautiful Miss Qian May I ask regarding your husband's funeral Is there anything else we can assist with? President Mr. Zheng's funeral is only awaiting this leg We can attach it this afternoon After that, there's only the funeral procession cremation and interment In that case, let me know when it happens Okay When it's time, I'll go pay my respects to Mr. Zheng Will this leg be cremated with my husband? Of course When this leg is returned to your husband's body they'll be cremated together After it's cremated won't this leg become ash? Miss Qian Human beings after we're cremated don't we all become ash? No When humans are cremated, we become bone ash When wood burns, it becomes only ash Bone ash and ash are not the same Miss Qian. What… What do you mean, the ashes are different? Isn't it all ash? When some people die we burn a Benz, burn a mansion burn servants for them in the afterlife Isn't it all ash? It's not the same A Benz and a mansion are external things Bone ash is our selves This leg is the same as a Benz It's a burnt offering It's not originally his What is this bullshit? I used a piece of the finest wood to carve your husband's stink-ass leg Now you say you don't want it? You want to me to display it in my office for visitors to ask So pretty. Whose leg is it? How the hell do I answer? This isn't my husband's leg Look here are your choices One Face the facts and go burn your husband Ｗhen he reincarnates he'll grow a new leg Two You take this leg and put it with your husband's body When it's cremated this will all be over Three Stick your husband in a freezer Wait a while and see if one day he starts sprouting a new leg President I'll see you in court then Ma'am When we opened clinics in the past we'd hang a plaque with a philanthropic inscription to express our charity in thought and deed But now, when we open hospitals there's no plaque Do you know what's behind the wall now? An army of ruthless lawyers Get this woman out of here Then take this My God Take this filthy thing out of my sight Hello Yeah I am He died two days ago Is something wrong? Health insurance How long has it been? About half a month Has your leg been injured before? In the past I had a car accident I think you'd better get a hospital exam Doctor Tell me It's fine I can handle it If you want my honest opinion With your situation It could be bone cancer Will I need amputation? Mr. Zheng Bone cancer treatment is very advanced now It's rare that amputation is needed But surgery to clean out the disease is definitely necessary What are you saying? You're talking about a crime There are 2 kinds of insurance cards One has a photo, the other doesn't Mine happens to have no photo If there's no photo, they still need to see your national ID John When you see the doctor Besides your national ID photo does anyone care if the rest is real or fake? I'm telling you Health insurance cards are impossible to forge But national IDs aren't hard Even if I give you a totally clean health record and apply for insurance you'll still need to wait before getting a checkup Is it fine to drag out your illness? The doctor said my symptoms only just started Cancer isn't some fast-acting disease If I wait three or six months it should be fine I think you've gone crazy You know I haven't been doing well the past few years Not well? Don't you always say you're doing great? John You know I'm a charming man Have you ever heard a charming man say he's not doing well? This is the first time I learned you're a charming man John What are you doing? I'm in the dressing room Doing what in the dressing room? Adjusting my look in the dressing room Why'd you shave like that? Aren't we taking an ID photo? Studio Sit here Do we need to do all this for a fake ID photo? My dad opened this studio My dad's named John Strictly speaking, I should be John II I always thought this art would never be replaced I never thought one day it would end This camera hasn't been used in over ten years and now it's being used to shoot your fake ID Come here I've finished it When I tell you to press, press down Press Who're you looking for? I want to make an ID What? I want to make an ID Come in National ID photo You want it exact or OK-exact? What's the difference? "Exact" can pass most police spot checks With OK-exact you can get a bank notarization or marry your mistress OK-exact Zi-han Zheng It went smoother than I thought John got me a clean health report I applied to an insurance company The company said the insurance policy would take effect after 90 days In other words I couldn't go to a clinic for 90 days to get any cancer exam After that, the only thing left to do was wait I didn't eat much each day I spent a lot of time walking I felt very calm Sometimes I'd pass John's place We didn't talk as much as we used to It didn't mean we had a falling out It meant that during this time John was waiting alongside me But waiting is not an easy task Elevator is down for maintenance What's wrong? It's nothing Want to see a doctor? It's nothing You call this nothing? Take a look in the mirror I'll go with you When a relationship comes to a deadlock the best solution is for one party to evoke sympathy in the other I never thought of getting your sympathy I only wanted to quietly do something for you I don't remember what happened that night When I awoke I was already in the hospital How did I get here? I taught class all day yesterday I didn't see you there I visited you in the evening You didn't wake no matter how I tried Why would you do this? You're sick but didn't see a doctor Are you still bitter? I'm not bitter but I thought you'd still be sour Hello Nurse Can you please raise the bed up? I want to see my leg Mr. Zheng, don't worry The diagnosis report will include photos We will provide you a copy What the hell is that? Don't pretend politeness and speak so impolitely My husband just wants to see his leg What's that to do with photos? Excuse me Doctor. Dr. Gao Mrs. Zheng. Can I have a word? Mr. Zheng's condition was untreated for too long If we don't amputate there's a risk of death Amputate? Is there no other way? Mrs. Zheng This is something I've had to tell many patients' families Keep the leg and lose your life or keep your life and lose the leg What did the doctor say? Bone cancer? Of course not It's nothing to do with bone cancer I got a call from the insurance company yesterday They said Zi-han had 20 million in cancer insurance and the premiums expired just this month They couldn't find him so they called me I was dazed and confused You were Zi-han's best friend Had you ever heard about any insurance? Did the insurance company say anything? They gave some condolences and then slithered away so they didn't pay a single penny Zi-han's insurance was for cancer He died of a blood clot from septicemia Nothing to do with cancer So of course the insurance company wouldn't pay up Do you know anything about this? Last month Zi-han's leg was uncomfortable, he saw a doctor The doctor said it could be bone cancer He came up with a plan He told me to get a health exam and used my health report to buy insurance I told him it'd bite him in the ass He said cancer cells wouldn't spread much in 3 or 5 months I didn't imagine it'd turn out this way You two look so different How could that work? I thought so too but it turns out it wasn't so difficult How could Zi-han be so dumb? The doctor said if he'd just started the medicine early, it would've been fine He believed he put a terrible burden on you He wanted to make it up to you with a few million This was a photo of you I always told him to take it home He always said "Next time, next time" When's the funeral? I don't know yet Why not? His leg's still missing Department of General Affairs Director Pan Does your department not make much money? This department looks different from the others Yes Our department has no surgeries no tests, no patient visits We don't make money That's why we're in this tiny corner Then you should have free time Miss Qian If you keep making trouble we'll all have a lot of free time soon Director Pan I just want to ask about the GPS Can't you tell me anything? I don't know what Qian Wang was smoking when he told you our garbage trucks use GPS Qian Wang told me that after the truck left my husband's leg would be incinerated in 84 hours Minus the last two days all I have left is today Director Pan Trust me If you don't tell me I will stay here with you I will follow you home When you go to sleep I will be there And I will tell your wife you're a man who doesn't take responsibility You're really sick Should I take you to the emergency room? After the emergency room, I'll come back to find you Everyone in the hospital knows about your case Everyone knows you won't stop Sign a consent form, and you regret it Give you a new leg, and you don't want it Helping a fickle person like you never ends well Director Pan Don't be so serious Let me tell you one of my husband's favorite jokes There's an old couple, married 50 years One morning They're sitting at the table eating breakfast The husband tells the wife "50 years ago, we used to take our clothes off and eat breakfast naked." The wife says "So you think we should take our clothes off now?" So The two of them took their clothes off and ate breakfast Then the wife says "Darling Guess what? My nipples are burning hot for you, just like 50 years ago." The husband says "That's no surprise Because one of the nipples is drooping into your coffee." Miss Qian If you don't leave I'm calling security What the hell's this? What hell are you? Don't snoop through my stuff The hell am I? The hell are you! What's the problem? We're fine, you're the problem Drive pass the interchange. The coordinates for the next stop. The car will stop for half an hour. They'll be at the incinerator at 5:30 p.m. Director Pan The driver's name is Huang. Don't mention my name. Just tell me where the truck is Is it so hard to help a widow? You're the most unwanted person in the whole hospital If you're fine, then get out Enough? Enough? If you don't go, I'll really call security I'll fucking sue you You won't tell me? I'll sue you, Director Pan Hey John Come pick me up and pick up some stuff for me too I'll text you what you need to buy You don't have a car? Can you borrow one? -I have no car either -What? You want to talk to my granny? My granny can't talk, she's terminally ill I'll call you later Climb a thousand peaks Godspeed I'll call you later Since we've met again can you do me a favor? Do you have a car? Yeah Can you take me down south? That's not cool I thought your husband just died and you know I have a girlfriend I'll explain in the car It's already past 4:30 p.m. Hold on This guy's really daring driving that kind of car to this kind of place You think the woman's in love? Not with this kind of place Why couldn't there be love? The chances are low But I think the woman loves him a lot He must've forgotten to pay What the hell are you doing? Can you drive like that? - What the hell? - Mr. Huang My name is Qian These two are my colleagues John and William We're radiation specialists from the EPA On July 5th An irradiated patient was amputated The amputated limb was improperly disposed of When we got the news, we tracked down your truck Isn't that lucky? I'm going to burn it If it gets burned the radiation will blast everywhere Your factory will be toast That's so fucked up Damn Wait, wait You aren't anybody EPA my ass What kind of car is that? What kind of clothes are those? You know you're holding a mosquito swatter? Mr. Huang This isn't a mosquito swatter This is the newest model radiation detector At 2:00 p.m. you were on the National Highway On the Nantou Interchange at 4:30 p.m. past the culvert Besides the EPA who could track your GPS? Fuck, you think I'm dumb? You followed me here and wrote down the GPS You think I don't know? Okay You're so smart You know we followed you You know how many traffic violations you had? Speeding, Illegal lane changes Littering cigarettes Also How long did you park at that diner? Is this waste truck allowed to park by diners? Were you playing with your lover? What do you want? Brother My colleague here may look like Lun-Mei Gwei But she only appears naive Everything she said is true We are EPA radiation technicians We by accident lost an irradiated specimen If we don't get it back we could end up losing our jobs However If an accident does happen the radiation could hit thousands of people Fuck, you're confusing me I don't know whether to believe you Mr. Huang It's fine You have two options now Option one You can call the police The police will retrieve the irradiated specimen My colleague and I will be written up and punished You will be written up for your traffic and parking violations Option two? Option two You let us retrieve the irradiated specimen I'll return it to the EPA Our records will remain clean and your lover at the diner won't be discovered Help us to help you This is called a win-win How about it? No It's win-win-win-win Since there's 4 people it's win-win-win-win Hold on though I'm not going up there No need we'll search by ourselves Be careful of radiation That day when you asked me whether to intubate My only thought was not to burden you I was lost for words I couldn't tell you much Even if I managed to recover I'd end up weighing you down My life started out as an uncertain journey It was you Now I should call you Miss Qian After I met you I gained a direction His body is intact now He has let go of worldly things Buddha will lead him to the other shore Please pay your respects Could I have a moment alone? I recall how I loved you at first sight How I lost my way I remember my regrets and your tears I still remember the first time you took me dancing It felt like you had taken me flying I remember my palms were sweating like a girl afraid of heights on a plane for the first time Later when I saw you getting abused at the seaside When I looked down at your face covered in bruises I realized I love you Not because you promised me anything I love you because you're the person I love The time is here My journey is finished I can only wish you safe happiness on your journey ahead to reach those distances I couldn't see Zi-han Finding your leg was the last thing I could do for you To give you back your wings I hope when you reach the other world you can fly free and find what you lost long ago Now I will wait in silence hoping to meet Miss Qian again one day At that time, I'll ask you for a dance Because long, long ago someone once said If love is enduring it will outlast a brief separation If it's possible I hope in dreams I can relive the feeling of the first time you took me flying
