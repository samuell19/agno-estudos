Hi Grandpa! Hi Grandchild! Sir, our cook today is awesome. He even has matching exhibition! That's Mac. My best friend. Actually, he's just having a vacation here. But he wants to unwind. That's why he substitutes as a cook. Hey! That looks delicious! Oh, yes! Do you want some? Maybe later, sir. Oh! Ouch! Ouch! Enough please! Gotcha! You're really awesome buddy Mac! I can really count on you! As long as... I am here... there's no room for chaos in this place! What was that? Ouch! What's wrong with you? You're getting into my nerves! - Drive properly! - Sorry dude! Boss, if you want, I can kill him! Dude... It seems your driving is bad today. I'm sorry dude. I was just excited. You know, I've been looking for a job for so long. I just approached you once and you hired me right away. Thanks buddy! It's okay! Okay! We're focused on work! Set your watches now. - It's all set boss! - It's okay now! Am I included? I don't have a watch. Don't you have a watch? I don't have one. Wait a second. Here... That's yours now buddy. This one? Yes! That's yours now! Thank you dude! Give out the masks. Here. There you go! Wear that! What is this for? So you won't be recognized... by the person we're going to rob. Is that your job? - Yes! For a long time! - What's the matter with you? Buddy! A decent job is what I'm looking for. Not something like this! Oh my! Wear it now! You're already here! You'll earn a lot in here! Never mind, dude! You go ahead. - You're unbelievable! - Come on! You're already wearing it! Come on! Dude, what's the matter? You're nothing, then! Shall I beat him up now? There's the target! Faster! Ouch! What's the matter? Get the bag! Faster! Wait! I know nothing about this! Don't butt in, okay? - Give me the bag! - We just might beat you up! - Give it now or I'll shoot you! - Okay! Wait, you might pull the trigger! Buddy! Give that to me! So you're fighting back? You're shameless, buddy! You're shameless! Ouch! Enough! Hold this! Hold this! So you're trying to get me in trouble? Give that to me! What's this commotion all about? Arrest those men! They are robbers! You will all rot in jail! Wait! Wait! I'm with him too! Yes sir! He's our driver! - Right? - That's not true! He was even the one who saved me. He's right! Okay, arrest them all! Dude! Tell them you're with us! "Dude" your face! Help me! Buddy! Thank you! - It's nothing, Sir. - By the way, I'm Mr. Toribio. Anyway, I'm Arthur. Buddy! Help us! The other one is your friend, right? Yes, sir. I asked him for a job. I didn't know that... they were in for a hold-up. That's why when I found out, I walked out right away. So you don't have a job? None, sir. If you want... right there in my resort... I can give you a job there. Really, sir? Yes! Here. Just present it there. Thank you, sir. Thank you too. Sir... Why are you still here? Aren't you supposed to be in the factory? But I cooked food for Boni. But why are you taking care of the cooking? There's a lot of maid who can do that! What you should focus on is my business! I'm not done with you yet! I'm already done! I'm sick and tired of handling your business! I give up! Hey! Macario! You might be forgetting about it! It's because of the business I inherited, that's why our life became convenient! You might be forgetting about it too! I'm the one who made that business grow! But the bad thing is... You changed! Your attitude changed! You became rude and snobbish! You're always yelling at me! You always pick on me! I'm your husband! I'm not a servant! What's bad is you're always about the money! You're always about the business! You have forgotten about our family! Well then... Whether you like it or not... you'll continue managing my business! Is that clear? It's dark! It's dark, huh? Here you go! This is a kitchen! Don't play here! Go play at the playground! I'm sorry Mr.Mac. It won't happen again. Exactly! Sir Mac! What happened to you? The yolk was crushed! Do you want me to massage it? This bald guy! You'd even want to massage it? May I ask a question? Where is the office of Mr Toribio? May I have your name, Sir? I am Arthur Calaycay. He told me to go here. It's in the Human Resources room. Go straight ahead... go down the stairs... The first room is Mr. Toribio's office. Her face is familiar. You're an applicant? Please have a seat there! This one looks like a genius. Brod? Don't talk to me. We're about to start! Take a seat there. Here are your test papers. Why did you throw it? My answers are all wrong! Does it mean my answers are wrong too? But why? I was just copying from you! A genius indeed! A genius in cheating! Has Cherry talked to you? He's Arthur. The one I told you that we'll hire as an assistant security? Oh, is it him? - You didn't say it! - You gave me a test paper right away. Cherry will take care of you. Me, too! Why? We... we're together. We're best friends. We're close right? Come on, say it! We're really close. For a long time! It's been 15 minutes already. Thank you sir! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much sir! Can you please let go of me? This is Cherry... Cherry will take charge of you. Just come back tomorrow. Bring your things, okay? Thank you, too! That's not your match! Let's go! Thank you again! You're heaven sent to me. It's nothing. Thank you, Brod! I really thank you! Thank you! I'll Kiss you. It's okay. It's okay now! I'm Arthur by the way. What? Why are you cursing? Oh no! My name is Nemo, brod. Oh, Nemo! Thank you so much! Thank you! It's okay now, Ma'am. My friend! - How are you? - I'm okay! Oh, my friend. May we ask for a glass of water? Sure my friend! My friend! You might want to make it two. Sit down! Who's Nemo Lindenburg? You'll be assigned at the restaurant. And your room mate... ...will be Bogart. That's me! Ouch! Why did you hit me? You told me to 'palo' you. It means, you follow him! I'm sorry. "Sorry" your face! Come on! My friend! Here's your water. Where's your companion? He already came in. My friend. I actually wanted an iced water. - No problem, buddy! - Put ice on it, okay? My friend! My friend! Can you lessen the ice? I don't want it too cold. Take out maybe two. Two? Nothing! My friend! My friend! Here's your drink. My friend, Mac... Hi my friend! Arthur will be your assistant! You're not a guest here? No! How dare you! With the way you order... it's as if you're paying my salary! And I was convinced because you're dressed up like a senator! Turns out you're just an employee here! But you didn't ask my friend! Don't call me 'my friend'! We're not buddies! That's enough! That's enough! Arthur will also be a stay-in here. It's okay. And also... He'll be the one you'll share the room with. Both of us? Yes! That's too rude of you! Why my friend Mac? I think he's complaining. Is there a problem? Nothing! It's nothing! I'm not complaining! Arthur was the guy who saved me. He was looking for a job. So I gave him one! That's just right - That's right. - That's why, get along with him! Oh, of course! That's cold. It's good! It's as if it has a flavor! There is. It's Kuko Pandan. So, where are we going? Where are we going? Let's go here. Ouch! I think you're mad. No. What 'comfort room'? This is my room! It looks like a storage room. Are you complaining? Because it looks like a stock room at first look. At first look? - Yes. - Then look at it twice! Oh, you're right! "You're right" It really is a room. That's your place. There! Don't you have a snake there? I just hope there is! You keep complaining! You have deceived me! I thought you're a son of Atienza. You're even dressed like a tourist! Even wearing those shades! Turns out you're just looking for a job. This jerk has fooled me. But you know what, Sir Mac. I think fate has destined us to be together. What a hideous fate you have thought about! What's that? Just look at it... Your name is Mac. Mine is Arthur. If you put the two together, Perfect match! Perfect match? That would no longer be a perfect match. Tomorrow, I will change my name! Please don't, Sir Mac! I'll just change mine. You can also call me Turo for short. You can be a 'toro'. Isn't that malicious? Not that kind of 'toro'! The kind that attacks a person! Attack a person? He might follow! I'll go there! You'll go there? I'll stay here. What's with you? Why? Can I go to the pool? But, I still have... Hey, Turo! He's going to the pool. Go with him! Why are you still using that? I'm already beside you! Let's go! Okay! Isn't your name Arthur? Why does Mr.Mac call you 'Toro'? Just let him be. That's his trip. No messing with each other's trip, okay? Let's just see... if you won't get in trouble with that kid! I swear! You know what, Nicky? I think you won't enjoy here in the pool. It's better if we'll go to the playground. Come on! Let's just go to the playground! Wait a minute. I will enjoy... You will enjoy better here in the pool. It's hot in the playground! Let's just stay here. You're so cute! I want that! What is that? Do you want me to rub it on you? Rub it on my back. It feels like... Your hands grew bigger... There it is... It's back to how it was before! Where is Turo? There he is! It feels like... Your hands became wrinkly, Nicky... Are you tired? Not yet! Hey! What's that? That's mine! Are you deaf? Sir Mac, are you okay? He hit me! He's my boyfriend. Why? Why is he putting lotion on you? It was Nicky a while ago. That was already him! I tried to stop him but he doesn't want to. What? You tempted me! You're really a mess in my life! Is that so? You two are together. Come here. I will now massage you with punches! That shameless Arthur! He's even worse than a Makapili when he points finger! That's why I got in trouble! I'd love to Kill him! Mr.Mac! Why are you that mad at Arthur? It's too much! I'm anxious! I want to kill him! Ouch! Mr.Mac, why are you hitting me? I will really crush him! Mr.Mac, wait a second! Before you go hysterical, I'll leave now! The way this man snores is horrible! It's like I'm beside 3 generators! My goodness! This man snores from his nose too! Now he sounds like an elephant struggling in giving birth! Goodnight sir my friend! I can't see! Am I blind? Maybe I have sore eyes. What a huge eye crust this is. Why do I have money here? I can't breathe! Why is there a clip on my nose? I was turned into Pinocchio. What is happening to my face? Am I a spirit now? That scum! Now I know who did this! Only one asshole can do this! That bastard! Really, Arthur? You did that? Of course! Oh my gosh! Ouch! How dare you! I will kill you! Sir Mac, calm down! Let me go! I'll just kill him for a second! Why sir Mac? Why? What did you do to my face? I only did that because... you snore so bad! I couldn't sleep, do you know that? Is that so? You couldn't sleep? Well! Look for another place to sleep! Get out of there! If I only have another place to go to, why not? Oh Arthur! Our room is too small! Buddy! In fact, we sleep standing. Well, if that's the case... I'll just have to endure... the snores and the scruffiness of this man! Is that so? You're dead! I'm going to kill you! Ma'am? I want you to clean the whole house. My only daughter will arrive today. Yes, Ma'am. What are my other appointments after the airport? An ocular at the new factory site. And then you have a dinner with Mr. Sun. I'll just have to confirm the venue. Tell him it will be here at home. Here it is. Why do you think Sir Mac is always mad at me? Just don't mind him. They said he's kind, bro. He's kind? If he's kind then there'd be no rude people anymore! The only thing missing is a spoon! Let's just see... Bogart told me. He has family problems that's why he's always grumpy. So he has a problem with his family? What do I have to do with that? Why am I involved? If that happens... He will evacuate! Just don't mind him. Time will come, he'll be good to you tool When could it be? That's what we don't know. Then find out! Can I just do it tomorrow? My goodness! The tray is still here! Me? Just for a while! That's it! That's what I'm telling you about! Why, Sir Mac? Let's eat snack together! - Really? - Yes! I cooked that! Yes! Oh my! I'm ashamed. You even bothered, sir Mac. It's nothing! You know... I wanted to... I did that for us to be close to each other. Right, my friend? Oh! That's okay with me sir, my friend! Nemo has an angel's tongue! Sit down! Perfect! I even brought a spoon! Go ahead! Let's eat it while it's hot. This is my favorite! Sip it for a better taste! Sir my friend! It's delicious! You really cook well! The taste is getting through! Yes! It'll work! It be flaming! - What did you say? - No, I said It's flaming with great taste! Definitely! Great! Is that you? No! I think it's me! Sir, my friend? Are you okay? I feel like I'm about to give birth! Wait a second. Wait! Wait a minute! That's terrible! What happened to him? Sir Mac, what happened to you? Move away! I'm sorry about what happened a while ago. At the pool. It's okay Mr.Mac. I just hope it doesn't happen again. Oh! It won't happen again! It won't happen again! I have a call. That's my ringtone! I forgot to press it. Yes. In fact, it's already boiling. My ringtone is cool, isn't it? You're right! But it stinks! Why... did it work on me? It's supposed to be for him! It's true... ...that man really has grudges on me! You will be the one to solve... my problem with that animal! There is no escaping these ants! Ouch! Don't bite me! We're not the right match! I'll have you target someone! Call the entire syndicate! Bring him down! Sir, my friend! You've been so deprived... ...of waking up! Oh, let me help you. Thank you! Wait. Your hero boyfriend... Where is he? He might get jealous again! Not here. He went back to Manila. That's good. So there's no pest! Why? - What happened? - Ouch! What's that? Ouch! Wait, it's as if somethings biting me! Look at it! Look! Look at it! What is this? Go ahead! Scratch it more! Where else? You were bitten again? - I can't... - In your butt? - In your butt? - In my butt! That's it! Faster! Look! It's a hantik again! I can't! I won't! I won't! You're dead now! Sir, please don't! I just followed a command! How dare you! You feasted on me! No one else can do that to me. You were in the bathroom for hours! What did you do there? I just scratched, sir my friend! Why? What's itching on you? Just my whole body. That's probably why... ...you scratch like this. How are you now? I'm a little okay now. Okay then... Your scratching was really awesome. Scratch it! Scratch it! Thank you my dear hantiks! I've finally revenged! Next time, I'll be using a piranha to revenge on you! Ouch! Why? What did you say? Don't fool me! You're the one who did this! Sir Mac! Don't accuse me of something like that! I have nothing to do with that! What do you mean you're innocent? You did this! Oh, let's not do this Sir Mac. I didn't even have bad thoughts about you. Even if I know... That it was you who put those ants in my clothes! I know nothing about that! Now you're acting innocent! Look what happened! There! My body turned into Chocolate Hills! And this is the worst one! Here it is! Swollen! Sir, my friend. Since we can't get along... It's so much better... If we divide this room... So we'd be out of each other's businesses! Of all the things you said, that's the only thing that's right! Fine! Let's divide it! But in one condition! Don't ever call me ' my friend! Then, I won't! Is that all? Where is sir Mac? There are so many orders now! Wait a minute! Have you seen Sir Mac? There's a lot of orders coming! I'm doing a lot of things! I don't know. Arthur wait! Don't you really know where Sir Mac is? Tell me, please! I said, I don't know! Arthur! Wait a minute! Where is Sir Mac? - I'm already doing so many... - There he is! Where is he? I told you, I don't know! But I was just asking! I was just asking. What is that? Your eyes have been useless ever since. Can't you see it? That's the new style of braces today! Those are not braces! That's a retainer! You see, it has colors! It's color red! Now I know! That's a thermometer! Mr.Mac is sick! What did he say? - What did he say? - I didn't get it either! Will you get out of there? What is that? A toothbrush! So that's it! - What did he say? - You made it hard for yourself! What did he say? Ouch! What is that really, Mr.Mac? A toothbrush. Someone put a glue! It was glued. Oh, by Turo? By Arthur? I can't take it off. - You want to remove it? - I can't take it out! You can't take it out? What do you want us to do? - Help me take this off! - Let's help him. Go to the other side. Hold this. Get ready, just hold on. One.. Two.. Three! Three! Pull! Wait a minute. Count! Why... ...are your teeth like that? It's like a pig's fingernail! You know, your situation with Sir Mac is difficult. That's why you have to get along. Even if we don', it's fine with me. You'll see. You might need his help someday. It's up to you! That's what's never going to happen. Wait a minute. To whom is your loyalty? To Sir Mac? Or to me? To you, of course! Really? - Of course! - Fine. Do you really have to ask that? Can I just spell 'red'? It's not even a color! That's why nobody falls in love with you. That's what you think! No one! How about you? Do you have a girlfriend? None, too! I just haven't seen... the girl who'll make my heart beat. She's beautiful! Here it is! Here she is! Boni, my dear! Sir Mac's daughter? You're so dead, Arthur! I missed you so much! When did you arrive? Mommy fetched me. But you weren't there. I think we better... ...go to your Ninong Toribio! Because he'll be happy to see you! - Okay, daddy. - Come on! Why my friend? - My friend! - Is there a problem? Your godchild! She's all grown up! Come quick! My godchild has grown up so much! - She's tall, right? - Yes! What is my godchild planning? I would like to stay here... Probably around 2 to 3 days? - Thank you my friend! - Anytime my friend! Ouch! Ouch! Oh! I'm sorry! Hey! Don't touch that! He has rabies! Your apologies are useless. He's used to getting beat up! Hey Turo! Since we can't get along, ...that room is all yours! I'm leaving! Come on my dear! Let's go! That's my assistant. What 'cute'? More like acute! You're the cute one my dear! You became even prettier! Yes, my dear! I'm happy with my job anyway. Here we are. We're here now my dear! Let's just go home and make peace with mommy. Sorry my dear. But your mom and I just can't get along anymore. Just put up with mommy, dad. My dear! I've given enough patience for your mommy. I've already ran out of it! Even 'pacencia' cookies from the bakery are all gone too! My dear! This cottage your godfather gave you is very nice! You're sad again! You know... I don't like you seeing me and your mom fighting. That's why most of the time, I'm the one who stays away. You know very well that... I always want to see you happy. Do you really want me to be happy? Of course, I do. So you have to come with me when I go home. Because I want you to be there on my birthday celebration. Instead of... making your celebration awesome, your mom and I just might ruin it. Boni, my dear! Please understand me. Of all the men she can have as her daddy... - why does it have to be Sir Mac? - This looks dulled. Ouch! Come on! Do you want this? Do you want this? Get lost! I told you. Reconcile with Sir Mac. Never mind! He's already done a lot of things to me! He has already said hurtful words! And I will just make peace with him? So if that's the case... Then just bear wit it! Forget about Boni too. Now that's impossible And why is it not possible? Because she's the girl I've always dreamt of. I'll do everything just to make her fall in love with me. We have to get close to each other! Before that happens, What you should do first... ...is to get closer to Sir Mac. Is that really necessary? It's very necessary! So that... there'd be no hindrance in your courtship. Ouch! So you're really trying me? What now? You really meant it, didn't you? Do you want me to chop you into pieces? Come here! Come here! Ma'am? - Has your Ma'am Boni arrived? - She's not yet here, Ma'am. Oh my, Ma'am looks mad. What did you say? It's true! Those flowers are nice! Is that for me? You monkey! This is for my daughter! This is her favorite. Too bad. Don't worry, I'll give you one! Really Mr.Mac? I'll give you a wreath later! Mr.Mac, that's a promise, okay? Stupid! Sir Mac, a phone call for you. Yes sir. Who could this be? Bonifacia is there, isn't she? She's here! Will you tell her to come home right away? I don't want you to be together for a long time! She said... - she'd stay here just for a while. - Will you please make sure of that Macario!? Or else I will never stop pestering you! Yes! How are you anyway? - Sir Mac, who was that? - I don't know! Where are my flowers? I didn't notice it. I just placed it here! Where is it now? But why are you taking care of the cooking? What I want is for you to focus on my business! You became rude and snobbish! You're always yelling at me! You always pick on me! You have a crush on Mr. Mac's daughter. Hey! These flowers are for you. Thank you. Who gave this? It's him. Thank you. This is my favorite flower. Why did you give me flowers? The flowers suits you. They're beautiful like you. By the way, I'm Arthur. Don't shake his hand. You might get infected with tetanus. Arthur just wanted to meet me. Look. He even gave me flowers. His flowers? It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. Ouch! Why, Sir Mac?! This is mine! What? I bought this. Hey! Hey! Sorry. I'll shut up. I'll shut up. - What did you say? - I'll go now. Thank you for the flowers. - Ouch. - I said go. I don't want you to be friends with that guy. There's nothing wrong with that, right? He just wanted to meet me. You don't even know that guy. The guy just wanted to be friends. Oh My... You really... You really... Bonifacia! He wanted to be friends with you?! He has a different motive towards you! I don't see Arthur like that. I can see deep inside that he's a good person. Just stay away from him! I don't want to have snake blood on us. Okay, I'll follow you. But you also have to do what I want. That you'll come with me when I go home for my birthday. Now you're passing on the subject to me. Now you're doing that! Come on. Let's go. Let's go. This is my boyfriend. Hey. What happened? I don't know. You can hug me anytime. Just don't make it too tight. I can't breathe. Yes? Have you seen Boni? No. Mr. Mac! Mr. Mac! Mr. Mac! - Why?! - It's Boni! She's stuck on the elevator! She's stuck?! Oh no! My daughter! My daughter. What happened?! Sir, there's just a technical problem. Technical? How long is she stuck there? - About 15 minutes already. - Oh My! Here. Here. Here. Last one. Let's go back to riddle. You're good at it. Answer the riddle. My hard stick, in and out from the hole, if you push it hard, and you play it round and round, Ooooh! You'll get tickled! What is it? It sounds malicious. No! Okay. I give up. My hard stick, in and out from the hole, it's cotton buds. It's working! I hope it'll get busted again. What happened?! - It's already fixed. - It's fixed! Thank God! You're fun to talk to, Arthur. I almost didn't feel that we're stuck on the elevator. It's good that you're entertained. I just took your fears away. Thank you. Hey! Why are you all around my daughter?! Damn you! I'll kill you! Just be patient with daddy. That's okay. I understand. Daddies are like that. They are protective towards their daughter. I envy you. I hope daddy will also understand me. What did you say? Nothing. There is. Tell me. Maybe I could help you. Really? It's my birthday on the 27th. I want daddy to be there. But he doesn't want to because he and my mom couldn't get along. Is that it? Okay. I'll try my powers. I'll help you convince him. Oh My! I think it's impossible. Because he's really mad at you. What did you do to him? Nothing much. He's really like that because he's in the menopause stage now. - Who's menopause?! - You. This one's for real. There'd be no mess-up this time! What the?! What are you doing there? Are you insane?! You wanted to kiss me too! Damn you. You're really disobedient! There! You wanted to get kissed. Where did he come from? Where is he? Behead Turo! Go inside! But, my dear... So much, my child. I know that. And I also know that you still love mommy. Advance Happy birthday, my child. It's because of you! I told you not to go there. I want to be with my daddy on my birthday celebration. He just wanted to get rotten there. He doesn't even wanted to manage our business. When will you stop doing that to daddy? Until I see him making an effort to manage our business. Dad did a lot for your business. Will you please?! Let's stop talking about your daddy! I don't like that. You might just get me poisoned. Come on, Sir Mac. Why would I do that to you? I just found out that you like siopao. That's why brought you this. This is delicious. It's special. There's salted egg. There's chorizo. There's sausage. There's callos. There's menu do. There's kare kare. Crazy! Is there a siopao with kare kare? So I have to dip that to a shrimp paste? Because it is special for you. - If you don't want, I'll give it to these two. - Give it to me. Give it to me. -There's no poison in here -None. Okay. You can have my coffee. You're so sweet. What the?! It's so sweet! - What the?! - Let's go! Come on. - Is it good? - It's good. Do you want me to bring you siopao again later? Just let me and Boni get close to each other. Monkey! What daddy?! I was just carried away by my feelings. By the way, where's Boni? She went back to Manila. What?! She went back?! - When? - Last night. She's mad because I didn't want to accompany her. I should've gone with her then. Nature might get mad at you. Hey! I told you to stay away from my daughter. Now... stay away from my siopao too. Do you agree now on investing? I'll think about it, Mr. Toribio. I might not be able to handle a capital this big. What —? What do you mean you can't support it? You really have low self esteem! You always want cheap business! Not really, dear. Don't worry, Mr. Toribio. He can handle it. I'll take care of him. You'll follow me! Clear?! Can you please refill my drink? Oh I remember, I have a surprise for you. What is it? -Here -Let's open it. Open it. I really like this necklace. You're really good! So you have to come with me when I go home. Because I want you to be there on my birthday celebration. What the?! Look at what you're doing! You're wet. What the?! - What happened?! - What's this?! - It's because --. - It's me. I bumped the cart. - I didn't mean it. Sorry! - I was the one bumped it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. - We bumped it! - Sorry. Now you're saying sorry. - What about the business?! - Business?! What business?! Let's go, dear. We're not finished yet. What do you mean we're not finished yet?! We're finished! Ms. Dexter! We'll talk first. We're not finished yet. Let's change it. Don't be mad. What the?! Do you want this? Boni, my child. I have already contacted my friend who's an international chef. He'll help us prepare your food for your birthday. I'm thinking of not celebrating my birthday. What?! My child, what are you thinking?! And your welcome party too. Hey. Why did you take the blame? I'm ready to face the consequences. Don't mind it, Sir Mac. I already took it. Why did you do that? I know you have a big problem. I don't want to add another one to it. You want me to owe you something. I don't think like that, Sir Mac. Or maybe you just want to be close to me. Because of my child. I'll repeat it. No deal. You have already planned everything. What else do we have to fix? ...we need things for the catering. And some people who will help the chef. I'll take care of that. What? Really?! Wow! I can really depend on you. It's good that you're not like your daddy. Do you know who my visitors were? They are investors. Because of your misdeeds! There! They're gone! I'm sorry. Sir. I'm ready to face the consequences you'll give us. Sir, I'm... I'm ready to be a beggar and go through the garbage at the streets. And sell my body if you'll fire me. Me? I will go abroad. What will do abroad? I'll beg money from people on the streets. It's where I will look over garbage. It's where I will sell my body. There you go! That's where you're good at! With crazy things! Just tell me if you don't need me anymore, Mr. Toribio. Don't think that... I once saved your life. And don't ever think that you owe me something. There's none. You don't have to think of anything that you owe me. - Hi, godfather! - Hey. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Okay. Okay. You're now forgiven. Because we have an important catering job to do. Don't get into trouble. What occasion? It's my godchild's birthday Boni. And we'll handle it. Really? But we have to bring Mac along. But I worry that he might not come. I thought of a way. I have a good news for you. We have a catering job in Manila. - In Manila?! - Yes. Sir Mac, it'll be in Manila! Mr. Mac, that's Manila. Yes, Mac. My man. Will you just let them go instead? I'll stay here in the resort alone. Wait, Sir Mac. It seems unfair! We're only the ones who will travel and get tired? Mr. Mac, I thought you're okay. I even look up to you. Now you will not come with us. We're all employees here. If Sir Mac doesn't want to, I won't come too. We can do that. If you'll not come, I won't come too. Me too! Boss, you can go cater by yourself. It can't be. Go with him! I'll stay here. I want to be alone. Mac, you have to come. See? That's an order! The four of us will go there. You keep whining. It's as if you're not an employee here. He's your boss. Am I right, boss? When will it be? You're really crazy. Good morning, sir. Bro, make it full tank. I'm hungry. Let's buy food inside. Then buy. Come with me. You can go alone. I'll stay here. Okay. If you don't want to come, you won't have food. I'll go with you. We'll go eat. Oh, Zsa. Which one? This chocolate? You act like a kid. Okay. I'll take it but you'll pay for it. It's not on our list. Take it please. Okay. Wow! The girls are beautiful. You're right, Sir Mac. Do you see those guys at the door? Looks like they're talking about us. Exactly! If you'll choose between the two... Who do you like? I'll examine it. The darker one is my type. The fairer one is my type. I kinda like the taller one. You know what? The one in green is a kind of cute. He's handsome too. But he's already a bit too old. I'll go with the fairer one. Also on second thought, I'll go with the darker one. The taller one looks like a womanizer. Doesn't it... They both look like a womanizer. You're enjoying, beautiful girls. Maybe we can join you. Can we? Why do you care if we're enjoying here? Yeah. Why do you care? Come on. I'll take care of it. Go on. Hurry. Mr. Mac... We'll take care of it. I'll handle it} Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Get out of there. Mom! He's really good! Thank you so much. You know? You're so charming and handsome. Don't tell anyone. Thank you. And you're super good in fighting! Just a bit. Thank you again. Let's go, Pia. Take care! Wait. Wait. What about me? Thank you too. Wait. I think I need more. One more. Okay. Pia, let's go. You're taking advantage. Bye! Mr. Mac! Hey! What about us?! Kiss each other. You're good in fight scenes. I didn't even get sweat. Oh yes. I think you didn't even get tired. No. - He really didn't. - Oh yes. Sir Mac, wake up. We're here. You really didn't get tired, huh? This is my house! Why did you bring me here? Mr. Mac, this is where we will cater. Oh my! I don't want to ruin my daughter's birthday. Give me the keys. Sir Mac. Sir Mac, wait a minute. You might be forgetting... Mr. Toribio made us go here to work. Yes. Boni, my child. What is he doing here? They're the catering service godfather sent us. They'll help the chef. Why did you bring along a useless person?! Hey. They just brought me along. And I'm not a useless person! You're the only one who always compute. It's only because I love my daughter. I love your daughter too. I love her. She's also my daughter. I don't want to ruin her party that's why I'll go now! Okay! That would be better! That's enough! If you really love me... Then get along! Even just for the sake of my birthday. That's the most beautiful gift I'll ever receive. That's enough. Be strong. Hey! You're sticking on my daughter! Hey! Okay! You can help the chef! But your father's not included. What will my friends say? He's with the service crew? Don't worry. For you to enjoy your party, I'll take whatever your mom will tell me. Okay. He can attend your birthday. Be strong. You Amay Calamay. Why? You! You played me around! What are you talking about? Why didn't you tell me we're going here?! You're even playing with my conscience! You're the ones who doesn't have conscience. If we told you that we're catering here, are you coming? No. That's why I didn't tell you. Now you're talking back. Or maybe... ...you just wanted to see Boni? You're only after your own interest. If I was thinking about it, I shouldn't have let you come. Your words hurt me, Sir Mac. Don't worry. Right after this, I'll go away. Even if it hurts. I won't bother your daughter. If that would make you happy. -If that would make you happy — -Stop that! We have to pay for that. Now what? Are you happy now? Your family's complete for your celebration. Don't worry. Right after this, I'll go away. I won't bother your daughter. What was that?! What are you doing here? I just wanted to be alone. Alone? Why are you with the crew? I also wanted to be alone. That's why we stayed together. That's enough! Stop this madness! You won't get anything from that man. Go on. Go inside. - Not you! - Not me. And you. Go on and work. Where is your one and only celebrant daughter? Come. I'll go with you. I'll introduce you to her. Come here, my child. Here is Chef Paco. This is my Bonifacia. Thank you. Remove 'po'. (Sign of respect) Our age gap is not that huge. Who are these people? They're the service crew who will help you. Not chief. Why? Do I look like a police? You have a badge. That's a brooch. Just bear with him, chef. And you! What happened to you 'F'? Do you have a defect? None. None. What is your name? Where did you get these people? Oh my, just bear with it. Boni was the one who got them. Just tell them if you need something. Bring this to the kitchen. Are these tools for cooking? That's my make up kit. Stupid! It's so cheap. I said, you're really beautiful, chef. I know that. Oh Gabriella. The menu that I prepared for you is my masterpiece. Oh My! What are you doing here? Who is he? He's just my husband. I thought he's a member of the service crew. It's embarrassing to admit it but you're right. He stays with our friend who sent your assistants. I don't stay there for nothing! I work there! Working? And that's what you chose? Instead of managing our business? I'm happy with my work there. But with your business, I'm losing my dignity! I'm losing my personality! Give me dignity. We are so rich. We have lots of business. But you're working for others. You're embarrassing! Why? Do you give me dignity? I don't have anything to be ashamed of! I'm proud of myself! And someday, you'll be proud of me! My name is Macario, not Magnifico. Is that his family name? This is what you're going to wear later. It's so beautiful! It's really beautiful! It fits me! Now we have to look for a pretty accessory that will fit that. Just wait. It's so beautiful. Oh My! Cinderella is nothing compared to you when you wear that. They will drool over you. Go on kiss papa. Come. Stay here. There. This one is for mama. So big! And this is for papa. A kiss? Okay I'll kiss papa. There's hair. We were really happy then, right? Your mom and I were really happy. Moreover when you came. Can't we bring that back? I hope. Where's the one I'm talking to? Because before, we only had a simple life. Your mom accepted me even if I was poor. We were happy. Even if we sometimes get broke. But we became even happier when you came into our lives. However... When she inherited the business from her parents, that's when everything changed. It turned into chaos. Your mom dedicated all her life to it. So mom is to blame? If you really look at it, I can't blame her. She's doing it... ...for your future. You know what? Your mom and I really love you so much. ...if you still love mommy? Of course. To tell you the truth, I love your mommy so much. Whenever I see you, I see her. Really? I miss her. But then... She doesn't appreciate the things I do. Just like this simple thing I made... for your birthday. This is my gift, my child. Happy Birthday. What's this? I saved all my salary. You need it more. I don't need that. That is for your future, my child. I want you to be happy on your birthday, my child. You... Yes, chef. You... What are you staring at there? - Start slicing my vegetables! - Yes. Yes. Here it is. You... Wipe my sweat. Not that. The clean one. It's better. You're not oily anymore. Mr. Toribio's in Hong Kong. He just wanted to give this to Boni. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Oh My! You're so beautiful! - Thank you. So you're the classmates of my daughter! Okay. Okay. Thank you. The rolling pin. Here's the rolling pin. Why don't you give him? It's chief. Oh My! Oh My! Not chef, What chief? - Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. - What are we going to do? Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! What? It's chef Paco... What happened? He fainted. “Why? - His head bumped. Oh My! Call an ambulance! That's a problem! That's not the problem Sir my friend. What? The problem is... the food is not ready yet. We can't tell your wife, because I'm sure she'll get mad. Oh My! I'm sure of that! Now what are we going to do? I'm so happy because the people who love me are here. Most especially to the two persons important to me. Whom I owe my life to. Serve the food. Take out the food. Of course that's delicious... Because Chef Paco is the one who prepared the food. We have to meet him, Gabby. Will you please call Chef Paco. Chef Paco? What are you waiting for? Now! We prepared lots of food for our beloved guests. It's Mr. Mac, Ma'am Gabby's husband. Because something happened with the chef. That's why I'm the one who cooked. I don't need your apologies! I'm the one who has to say sorry. For all my wrong judgments of you. Really? I love you too so much. Hey! Why are you doing that? I was just carried away. Oh I remember. Wait. Where's Chef Paco? What happened to him? - A while ago... - You animal! What now, my friend? I'll stay here. Thank you. It's nothing, Sir my friend. We'll go ahead now. Thank you so much for everything. Sorry for the trouble that happened. I should even say thank you for the things that happened. Because mommy and daddy is together again. Arthur's taking so long. I'm so sleepy. Here he is. Let's go. Let's go. My friend! What are you doing here? I just want to thank you again. Because of you... My family and I are now okay. You don't have to worry about it. Sir my friend. Where exactly are you going? I'll go away, my friend. If I stay here, I'll just remember beautiful things that happened between me and Boni. Don't you want that, my friend? It just hurt me more, my friend. When I first saw Boni, I already loved her. And my love for her will stay in my heart. But as a gentleman, I have to do my promise to you of staying away from Boni. That's what I don't want to happen. Since mom and dad's problem is now okay. We should fix ours too. Really? Is that true? Is that true? You're now emoting. He said, attack. Hey. Hey. Wait a minute! Let them be! They're okay already. Fix me. Don't get envy. Don't get envy. Take care of my business! - I'm not finished with you yet! - I'm finished! I'm tired of — Don't you want that, my friend. It'll just hurt me a lot, my friend.
