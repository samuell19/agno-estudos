I'LL HAVE IT UPSTAIRS FOR YOU BY THE TIME YOU GET UP THERE. OH, THAT'S THE SPIRIT. CHEERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. -VERY KIND. -THANK YOU. NO, NO, NO, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS. -I WANT MORE. -CARLTON, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE HOTEL DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB. LOOK AT THIS TREE. IT'S GORGEOUS. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT CHRISTMAS. I WANT... MORE. YES. I KNOW. YOUR PARENTS NEVER LET YOU CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS GROWING UP, SO NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME. SWEETHEART... [SIGHS] PLEASE DON'T TRIVIALIZE MY CHILDHOOD, IT'S MY PAIN. NOW YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT, BUT YOU CAN, AT LEAST, RESPECT IT. COME ON. WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE THEATRE. WE'VE GOT TIME. WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH A RUSH? CARLTON, IT'S A 45 MINUTE DRIVE FROM HERE, AND YOU'RE CREW IS WAITING FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT ME TO BE YOUR FIANCÉ AND BUSINESS MANAGER, YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME. YES, BUT I'M NOT THE ONE WHO WANTED TO TAKE THE SCENIC ROUTE TO THE HOTEL. OH, WELL YOU HAD TO STAY IN THE CITY. THERE ARE PLENTY OF NICE HOTELS IN PALO ALTO. I ONLY STAY IN 5-STAR HOTELS. NOW, YOU KNOW THAT. -LET'S GO. -OH. ALRIGHT. WE'RE COMING BACK. AH! LEAVING US SO SOON, MR. AND MRS. WELLS? [CHUCKLING] OH, WE'RE NOT MARRIED YET. WE'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE NEW YEAR. OR WHEN IT FITS IN HIS SCHEDULE. RIGHT. YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD DAY NOW. OH NO, NO, NO, NO! MY NAME SHOULD BE BIGGER! WHAT? I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT. MAKE MY NAME AS BIG AS "THE NUTCRACKER." PEOPLE ARE COMING TO SEE MY RENDITION OF THIS CHRISTMAS CLASSIC. I'M THE DRAW. THE DRAW IS THE ROMANCE AND MAGIC OF THE STORY ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG GIRLS. YES, BUT I'M THE ONE WHO'S BRINGING THE MAGIC TO LIFE. JUST LIKE HOW YOU BRING THE MAGIC INTO MY LIFE? [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS] DARLING, EXACTLY. [KAYLA SIGHS] -WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I NEED YOU. -YOU DON'T NEED ME. YOU ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY TOOTING YOUR OWN HORN. [LAUGHS] OH, DARLING, ARE YOU JEALOUS? [SCOFFING LAUGH] OF COURSE NOT. IT'S JUST THAT YOU... YOU TREAT ME LIKE YOUR BUSINESS MANAGER RATHER THAN YOUR FIANCÉ. BUT YOU ARE MY BUSINESS MANAGER. LOOK, RIGHT NOW I NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON CARLTON WELLS. -NOW, YOU'LL SEE ABOUT THE MARQUIS BUSINESS? -YES. YES, I WILL, AND I WILL CONFIRM YOUR TELEVISION INTERVIEWS. YOU TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF ME, DARLING. IT'S WHY I LOVE YOU. I'M GOING TO MEET MY TEAM. SEE YOU IN A BIT. KISSES. LADIES! I THOUGHT WE WERE TEAM. [PEOPLE SING CHRISTMAS MUSIC] [BELL JINGLES] HO, HO, HO! MAKE A DONATION. MAKE A WISH. NO WISH? TRUE LOVE IS ALWAYS A WORTHY WISH. YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT THAT WISH CAME TRUE 2 YEARS AGO, BUT... NOW I'M NOT SO SURE. WHEN I GOT TO THE HAPPILY EVER ENDING PART OF OUR STORY, THE RELATIONSHIP KINDA TURNED INTO A BUSINESS DEAL. WELL, YOU COULD WISH FOR THAT SPARK TO BE RENEWED? YEAH, THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA, CONSIDERING I'M ABOUT TO GET MARRIED. I WISH THAT YOUNG GIRL OVER THERE HAS ALL OF HER DREAMS COME TRUE. [CHUCKLING] OH, NICE WISH. MERRY CHRISTMAS. -MERRY CHRISTMAS, SANTA. -HO, HO, HO! MERRY CHRISTMAS! HO, HO, HO! [BELLS JINGLE] KAYLA? KAYLA HANSEN? OH, IT IS YOU. OR SHOULD I SAY, MRS. CARLTON WELLS? HELLO, MRS. JOYNER. YOU'VE BEEN GONE SO LONG FROM PALO ALTO. WE WERE WONDERING WHEN YOU WOULD COME BACK. WE ARE SO EXCITED FOR YOU! YOU KNOW, I AM A HUGE FAN OF CARLTON WELLS. I HAVE SEEN EVERY ONE OF HIS PICTURES. WE COULD USE YOU IN THE ROTARY CLUB AND THE PTA COULD REALLY USE YOUR SMARTS. -YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. -OH, YEAH, THAT'S... GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT SCHOOLS NEED. -SO I HAVE A QUESTION. -AND, YOU AND CARLTON SHOULD BECOME MEMBERS OF MY BRIDGE CLUB. OH, THAT'S GREAT. BUT THE THING THAT YOU COULD DO THE MOST IS GIVE THIS LITTLE FAN THE THRILL OF HER LIFE BY GETTING YOUR WONDERFUL HUSBAND-- I'M SORRY, BUT I REALLY HAVE TO GET GOING. TO GIVE AN AUTOGRAPH BECAUSE THIS PICTURE HERE, I WOULD HANG IT, I PROMISE I WOULD HANG IT IN A VERY PROMINENT, VERY, VERY NICE PLACE IN THE... STORE. [DOOR BELL JINGLES] WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW DO THEY LOOK? IT'S NOT HOW THEY LOOK, IT'S HOW THEY TASTE. I AGREE, BUT FOOD IS ALL ABOUT PRESENTATION. I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO... FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT THE NUTCRACKER DESSERTS TO LOOK LIKE. I READ THAT CARLTON'S FIANCÉ COLLECTS NUTCRACKERS. MMM. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG THAT TOOK TO MAKE? -THIS IS NOT BAD. -HEY! I WONDER WHAT THE FEET TASTE LIKE. [LAUGHS] THAT'S ENOUGH. [LAUGHS] OKAY, WELL LOOK. FROM WHAT I HEAR, CARLTON WELLS IS EXTREMELY PARTICULAR. HE'S A BIG-TIME DIRECTOR, YOU KNOW? SO IF HE'S HAPPY WITH THE PARTY AND WITH YOU AS A CATERER, HIS PRAISE COULD BRING US A LOT MORE CATERING JOBS. EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT. THAT'S WHY I'M COUNTING ON YOU, KIM, MY TRUSTY ASSISTANT, AND FAVORITE COUSIN... AW. TO BE MY NUTCRACKER WHISPERER. PICK THE ONE THAT SPEAKS TO YOU. WELL THEY ALL TASTE GREAT, BUT... YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T REALLY LOOK LIKE NUTCRACKERS. HMM. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [CHUCKLES] ONE SEC. IT'S JOSHUA, FROM THE ANIMAL SHELTER. TELL ME YOU DIDN'T OFFER HIM ANY MORE DOG COOKIES. HOW DID YOU KNOW? [CHUCKLES] HEY, JOSHUA. YES, WE'LL BE BAKING COOKIES TOMORROW AND BRINGING THEM BY THE ANIMAL SHELTER. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU TOO. WHAT? WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE DOG FOOD. I THOUGHT YOU LIKED DOGS. I GOTTA GO MEET JANA AT THE TAVERN. PLEASE DON'T EAT ANY MORE NUTCRACKERS. I'M NOT GOING TO EAT ANY MORE NUTCRACKERS. GET OUT OF HERE. MMM. BE... THERE... IN A... MOMENT...

[METALLIC CLATTERING] LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ON OUR WAY, MA'AM. OH, DOGGONE IT! THANKS FOR NOTHING, LOVER-BOY. [CHUCKLES] [CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYS] HI. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD... MAYBE IGNORE YOUR PHONE FOR 1 SECOND ANY PAY ATTENTION TO ME FOR ONCE? [SIGHS] BEFORE WE WERE ENGAGED, YOU USED TO... HOLD ME CLOSE, AND KISS ME AND TELL ME THAT YOU LOVED ME. NOW I CAN'T EVEN GET YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME UNLESS YOU NEED ME FOR WORK. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? YOU... I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME WITH THEM. JADA-TODAY. HER NAME IS JANA, AND SHE IS HOSTING AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY FOR US AT HER EXPENSE. SHE'S A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WHOLE ENGAGEMENT PARTY. WHY? YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. JANA IS THE BEST PARTY PLANNER IN THE SOUTH BAY. SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE SERVING CHEESE FROM A CAN. YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY KIND OF LIKE THAT WHIZZY CHEESE. IT'S SO... WHIZZY. OKAY. LET'S GO. -HELLO. -[GASPS] HI! HEY, SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. [GROANS] SO, I'VE HAD AN INTERESTING DAY. WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

[CHUCKLES] OH HONEY, DUSTIN, I AM KIDDING. YOU WILL FIND SOMEBODY. I DON'T WANT TO. AFTER MY LAST FAILED RELATIONSHIP, I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON MY BUSINESS. A BUSINESS I HAVE, THANKS TO YOU AND ALL YOUR HELP. I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR ME, JANA. WELL, I DO HAVE MY MOTIVES. YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO, AND YOU MAKE ME LOOK FABULOUS AT EVERY EVENT. OH, BY THE WAY, HOW IS THE NEW MENU COMING? I MEAN, ARE THERE ANY NEW RECIPES I SHOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT? JUST A FEW LAST MINUTE HOLIDAY THINGS WE'RE WORKING ON. I GUESS THIS, AH, THIS CARLTON WELLS GUY'S KIND OF A NUT FOR CHRISTMAS. YEAH, UH, YEAH, KIND OF. I READ ONLINE THAT HIS DAD WOULD NEVER LET HIM CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS SO NOW HE JUST GOES WAY OVERBOARD. [LAUGHS] OH, KIND OF A CHRISTMAS PSYCHOSIS. YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH. ANYWAY, CARLTON IS ACTUALLY ON HIS WAY HERE RIGHT NOW. I'M GOING TO HAVE A COCKTAIL WITH HIM AND HIS FIANCÉ SHE IS ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS. WE USED TO WORK AT TREND TOGETHER. YOU SHOULD STAY AND HAVE A COCKTAIL WITH US. ACTUALLY, I CAN'T. I'M LOOKING AT SOME SPACES IN THE CITY. THINKING ABOUT OPENING MY OWN RESTAURANT. OH MY GOSH! THAT'S FANTASTIC, CONGRATULATIONS! JUST PLEASE DON'T STOP CATERING. -ALRIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU IN THE BUILDING. -OKAY. AND WATCH OUT FOR THE ELEVATOR. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN SOME CREEPY GUYS ARE GOING TO HANG AROUND WANTING A KISS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOSTING A PARTY IN MY HONOR. OKAY, WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S JANA, OKAY? AND THE PARTY IS IN KAYLA'S HONOR, BECAUSE SHE WAS A MOST BELOVED EMPLOYEE AT TREND, AND A FANTASTIC WRITER AND CLASS VALEDICTORIAN, AND WE'RE JUST HAPPY TO HAVE HER IN TOWN, EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR A SHORT WHILE. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME JUST ONE MOMENT? DARLING, WOULD YOU GET ME A GLASS OF WINE? -I... SURE. -THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. HELLO, YES. [NO AUDIO] [BOTH CHUCKLE] OKAY. WELL, I WAS GOING TO ASK HOW THE HAPPY COUPLE IS, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING IS A LITTLE... AMISS? OH, WE'RE... WE'RE FINE. IT'S PROBABLY JUST THE PRESSURE OF THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY AND THE SHOW. BUT YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE, RIGHT? WHAT? OF COURSE I AM. THINGS ARE JUST... TENSE RIGHT NOW. WE DECIDED TO HOLD OFF ON THE WEDDING UNTIL AFTER THE NEW YEAR. HE'S TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE NUTCRACKER PERFORMANCE AND I AGREED TO HANDLE HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS. OH. WELL, SHOULD WE CANCEL THE PARTY? WHAT? NO, NO! THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR US. BESIDES, I WANT EVERYONE TO MEET CARLTON. WELL, THE ENTIRE TOWN IS DYING TO MEET HIM. THAT'S FOR SURE. OH, YOU JUST MISSED THE CATERER. HE IS A TOP NOTCH CHEF, AND A SWEETHEART OF A GUY. OKAY, SO WHY ARE YOU NOT DATING HIM? OH, NO, NO. HE'S LIKE MY BROTHER. I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE I WAS 5 YEARS OLD. [KAYLA] OH.

TELL ME EVERYTHING. SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL. I HAVE NEVER KISSED A GIRL LIKE THAT BEFORE. WELL, WHO IS SHE? DID YOU GET HER NUMBER? DUSTIN, YOU DIDN'T GET HER NUMBER? NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR ME TO BE DISTRACTED. I NEED TO FOCUS ON WORK. SERIOUSLY FOCUS, I'M NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW. DUSTIN, IF WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE ELEVATOR IS TRUE, IT PAIRED YOU TWO FOR A REASON. IT WAS A FUN MOMENT. THAT'S IT. I'VE CHRISTENED THE ELEVATOR. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I HOPE I'M NEXT. WAIT, WHAT'S IN THE BAG? AH. THIS IS... THE NUTCRACKER. DUSTIN, IF YOU CAN MAKE THE DESSERTS LOOK LIKE THIS, YOU'D BE A GENIUS. HMM. WELL, THEN WE'D BETTER GET TO WORK. YEAH.

I WILL ASK HER. OKAY, BYE. CARLTON WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LOCATION OF THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY, MEET THE CATERER AND REVIEW THE MENU. DOESN'T HE HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO? [SNICKERS] HE'S A CONTROL FREAK. BUT YOU LOVE HIM? YES. OKAY. THE FLORIST HAS SAID THEY'RE ALL GOOD TO GO. PERFECT. I'LL GET THE NUTCRACKER OUT. UH, I'M HOPING HIS FIANCÉ WILL LOVE IT.

BUT I DON'T... I DON'T WANT PRESS AT OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY. DARLING, YOU'VE GOT TO START GETTING USED TO THE PUBLIC LIFE. EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS A CHANCE AT PROMOTION, EVEN... OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY. I THOUGHT THAT HAVING THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY IN MY HOME TOWN WOULD HELP GROUND US. I WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE GROUNDED, KAYLA. I'M DESTINED TO SOAR. [CHUCKLES] YOU CAN SOAR AND BE GROUNDED. YOU CAN SHOOT FOR THE STARS YET STILL APPRECIATE THE EARTH. I'M NOT SHOOTING FOR THE STARS. I AM A STAR. I'VE EARNED MY PLACE IN THE SKY. [CELL PHONE RINGS] THAT'S PAMELA. UH... THE SUGAR PLUM FAIRY. -I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS. UM... -OKAY. SEE YOU INSIDE? YES. KISSES. [RINGING CONTINUES] HELLO? [GASPS] [CHUCKLES] KAYLA? [CHUCKLES] DUSTIN. -HI. -HI.

THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING FROM. ME TOO! WHAT'S THIS? IT'S SOME HISTORY ON THE NUTCRACKER, AND A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARTIST. OH MY GOSH, THE ARTIST IS 80 YEARS OLD. HE MET THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE ON A TRIP TO AUSTRIA. ON THEIR VERY FIRST DATE, THEY WENT TO SEE THE NUTCRACKER. HE NEVER HAD A PASSION FOR ART UNTIL HE MET HER. THEY TRAVELLED, BUILT A HOME, A GARDEN AND A LIFE TOGETHER. ARE YOU SEEING WHAT I'M SEEING? THE CHEMISTRY? ...THEY'RE WRITERS, POETS, PAINTERS, SCULPTORS... THEY CREATE TOGETHER, INSPIRING EACH OTHER. THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 58 YEARS. [CHUCKLES] I WOULD LOVE TO WRITE ABOUT THIS. YOU SHOULD. IS THAT WHAT YOU DO? YOU'RE A WRITER? MAINLY PRESS RELEASES, BUT YEAH, I WAS A WRITER. WRITING IS MY PASSION, BUT I'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING SOMETHING TO WRITE THAT I FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT. THERE YOU GO. THERE'S YOUR STORY. [CARLTON] DARLING. YOU'RE THE OTHER HALF OF THE ENGAGEMENT. CARLTON, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET DUSTIN CASEY, THE CATERER, AND HIS ASSISTANT, KIM. -PLEASURE. -NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. DUSTIN, HAVE YOU OFFICIALLY MET KAYLA? AH... -UH... KIND OF. -KIND OF. YEAH. KAYLA IS MY FIANCÉ. KAYLA USED TO WRITE FOR TREND, UNTIL SHE MOVED AWAY. TO BE WITH ME. I TRUST WE'RE ALL FINISHED WITH THE SMALL-TALK. DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE FOOD? I'D LIKE TO SEE THE MENU. OH, OF COURSE. UM... HERE IS A LIST OF THE APPETIZERS, ENTREES, DESSERTS AND COCKTAILS. I TRUST YOU'LL BE EMPLOYING SEASONED BARTENDERS AND WAITERS? WE WILL. UGH! UGH! GET RID OF THAT... THING. -GET RID OF WHAT? -THAT NUTCRACKER. IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE ONE WE'RE USING IN THE BALLET. KAYLA WILL TEXT YOU A PICTURE OF THE ONE WE ARE USING. OH, OF COURSE. WHATEVER YOU NEED, MR. WELLS. DARLING? WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING. I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT A MEETING AT 9PM AT THE HOTEL. [CHUCKLES] THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TASTING THE FOOD. -IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU. -SEE YOU GUYS SOON. BYE. WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'M BACK TO BEING THE NUTCRACKER WHISPERER. IS THAT BAR OPEN? I THINK WE HAVE SOME WINE SAMPLES. GOOD. -I'LL POUR US SOME GLASSES. -YEAH. I SAW WHAT YOU WERE DOING. WHAT WAS I DOING? TRYING TO MAKE ME JEALOUS BY FLIRTING WITH THE CATERER. WHAT? HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT? IT WAS OBVIOUS, KAYLA! WELL, MAYBE IF YOU PAID ATTENTION TO ME I WOULDN'T BE SEARCHING FOR ATTENTION FROM OTHER MEN! HA! YOU ADMIT IT! ONLY THING THAT I ADMIT IS THAT THE CATERER IS A VERY NICE GUY AND YOU ARE A JERK! OH, WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET ENGAGED TO HIM INSTEAD OF ME! OKAY, I HAVE HAD ENOUGH! YOU AND I ARE DONE. WHAT? WHAT, ARE YOU SERIOUS? ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT JUST FLIRTING WITH HIM TO GET A REACTION OUT OF ME BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH ME? CARLTON, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. BUT WE DON'T FIT. AND WE STOPPED TRYING TO FIT. OUR PIECES BELONG IN DIFFERENT PUZZLES. I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU TOO, KAYLA. OKAY, NOW YOU'RE CONFUSING ME. I-I CAN'T TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW. I'M GOING. GOODBYE. OH, AND DON'T FORGET TO CALL YOUR TEAM. THEY'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU BEFORE THE END OF THE NIGHT. ALRIGHT. [KIM] SHE'S THE ONE YOU KISSED IN THE ELEVATOR, ISN'T SHE? DUSTIN? HUH? DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID? UH, HOW DO YOU FIGURE? BECAUSE YOU TWO LOOK LIKE TWO PEOPLE WHO JUST KISSED, AND WHO WANT TO KISS AGAIN? NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SHE'S NOT REALLY WITH CARLTON. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? OH, THEY ARE SO OBVIOUSLY NOT IN LOVE. I MEAN, THEY'VE PROBABLY ALREADY BROKEN UP AND ARE JUST STAYING TOGETHER THROUGH THE NUTCRACKER PERFORMANCE. [CHUCKLES] THEN WHY ARE WE PLANNING AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY? BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY THINK THAT CANCELLING IT NOW WOULD AFFECT THE SHOW. SHE LIVES IN LOS ANGELES THOUGH, RIGHT? AND SHE'S ONLY HERE THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE? YEAH, BUT THEIR HOTEL'S NOT THAT FAR. YOU COULD JUST HOP ON A TRAIN AND BE THERE IN NO TIME. AND THEN YOU CAN SWEEP HER OFF HER FEET. -ABSOLUTELY NOT. -COME ON. I'M JUST FOCUSING ON WORK RIGHT NOW, THIS IS WHERE I NEED TO BE. I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO ADD ANOTHER FAILED ATTEMPT TO MY SHORT LIST OF ROMANCES. LOVE JUST ISN'T MY THING. YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO BECOMING THE MALE VERSION OF A CRAZY CAT LADY. I'M MORE OF A DOG GUY. I'M HUNGRY. YOU GUYS WANT TO GET SOME DINNER? YES. YOU GUYS GO AHEAD. I'LL CLEAN UP HERE. -OKAY. -OKAY. [ANNOUNCER SPEAKS OVER LOUDSPEAKER] EVENING, SIR. EXCUSE ME, SIR? YEAH. HI. I NEED TO DROP OFF A PACKAGE FOR A GUEST, PLEASE. I COULD CERTAINLY HELP YOU WITH THAT. IT'S FOR CARLTON WELLS' FIANCÉ KAYLA. SURE. I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE IT RIGHT UP TO THE SUITE. THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT. [TAPPING ON KEYBOARD] [STOPS TAPPING] MORNING. MORNING. THAT... NUTCRACKER. DID... JANA LEAVE THAT FOR YOU? DID SHE? NO, JANA DIDN'T LEAVE IT FOR ME. WELL, THEN WHO DID? THE CATERER. YES. OF COURSE HE DID. [BREATHES DEEPLY] NOW, WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? HE KNEW I LIKED IT, AND HE KNEW I WAS INTERESTED IN WRITING ABOUT THE ARTIST. WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT WORKING ON IT NOW. WHY WOULD IT MATTER IF I DID? BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FOCUSING ON ME AND MY PRESS, KAYLA. CARLTON, I HAVE HANDLED ALL OF YOUR PRESS. I'VE ARRANGED FOR ALL OF YOUR ARTICLES AND INTERVIEWS, SO WHAT I DO DURING MY TIME IS MY DECISION. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS CATERER'S WEBSITE. IT'S ATROCIOUS. I'M VERY CONCERNED. YOU KNOW, HE'S ONLY BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR A YEAR. CARLTON, NONE OF THAT MATTERS ANY MORE. IT IS JUST A PARTY. IT NO LONGER HAS MEANING TO YOU OR ME. IT HAS MEANING TO ME. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SUPPORTING ME. IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL TO ME, KAYLA. I HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT SUPPORT YOU. I AGREED TO THIS ARRANGEMENT SOLELY IN SUPPORT OF YOU. THE PARTY WILL BE FINE. BESIDES... NOBODY'S GOING TO REMEMBER THE PARTY. THEY'RE GOING TO REMEMBER YOUR PERFORMANCE. YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT ME AND THE PERFORMANCE. NOBODY'S GOING TO REMEMBER THE PARTY OR THE BLOODY CATERER. I'M OFF TO REHEARSAL. I'VE ARRANGED A TOWN CAR TO COME AND GET ME. FEEL FREE TO USE THE BLACK CAR TO PICK UP SOMETHING NICE FOR THE PARTY. SPARE NO EXPENSE. YESTERDAY, WHEN I CALLED YOU OUT ABOUT BEING JEALOUS, IT WAS ACTUALLY ME WHO WAS JEALOUS. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SMILE OR BLUSH LIKE THAT IN A LONG TIME. I MISSED IT. I MISS US. CIAO. [DISTANT MACHINE SOUND] [MACHINE HUMMING] HEY. DUSTIN. DUSTIN! DUSTIN! [CHUCKLING] HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I NEED TO RETURN THIS. -NO YOU DON'T. -NO, I CAN'T KEEP IT. IT WAS A SWEET GESTURE.

YES. VERY NICE. SUPER NICE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. THINGS ARE REALLY COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW. IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME. -AT ALL. -EXACTLY. BUT... IT IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU TO WRITE ABOUT THAT ARTIST. I WANT TO. THEN TAKE THE NUTCRACKER AND WRITE THE STORY. NO ONE HAS EVER DONE SOMETHING SO... KIND AND GENEROUS [CLATTERING] AND... THOUGHTFUL AS WHAT YOU DID FOR ME LAST NIGHT, BRINGING ME THE NUTCRACKER. THANK YOU, DUSTIN. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE BOOK. [CHUCKLES] OH. BOOK, HUH? THAT COUPLE'S BEEN TOGETHER OVER 50 YEARS.

OR CONTACT THE DENTIST TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT -AFTER THE HOLIDAYS. -HMM. I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DUMP ALL OVER YOU. [LAUGHS] NO, IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, YOU CAN. I'M A GOOD LISTENER. I'VE GOT JUST NO RELATIONSHIP ADVICE, BECAUSE ALL MY PAST ONES HAVE FAILED, BUT I CAN LISTEN. WELL, YOU AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT I'M IN, OR I GUESS GETTING OUT OF, HAS FAILED. WHAT HAPPENED? WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PIZZA FOR THAT CONVERSATION. BUT IF I WERE TO TWEET IT IN 140 CHARACTERS OR LESS, THE ROMANCE WAS REPLACED WITH BUSINESS. HE STARTED TREATING ME MORE LIKE A PERSONAL MANAGER AND LESS LIKE HIS GIRLFRIEND. AND I LET HIM. I... I HANDLED EVERYTHING FOR HIM. HIS SCHEDULING, HIS PRESS CONTACTS, DESIGNING A WEBSITE. YOU KNOW, I LOST MYSELF, AND I LOST A LOVE THAT... STARTED OUT SO REAL. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IF I JUST... NO, DON'T DO THAT. THAT QUESTIONING "SHOULD'VE, WOULD'VE, COULD'VE" THING? BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE, AND YOU JUST GET STUCK IN A LOOP. THAT IS SOME PRETTY GOOD ADVICE FOR A SELF-PROCLAIMED LISTENER. [LAUGHS] YOU KNOW, I BET THE NUTCRACKER ARTIST, AS LONG AS THAT GUY'S BEEN MARRIED, PROBABLY HAS SOME AMAZING RELATIONSHIP ADVICE. I BET YOU'RE RIGHT. -YOU GOING TO WRITE THE STORY? -MM-HMM. -TONIGHT. -GOOD. [CAR HORN HONKS] MY CAB'S HERE. YEAH, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING. YEAH. I'M SURE CARLTON IS FUMING. WELL, THANKS FOR TODAY. I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU. ME TOO. I REALLY ENJOYED IT. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW THOUGH, RIGHT? OF COURSE. WE STILL HAVE THE FUNDRAISER TO WORK ON, RIGHT? YES. AH, CARLTON DOESN'T EAT CARBS. YEAH. GLADLY. [BOTH CHUCKLE] -GOODNIGHT. -GOODNIGHT. HOW WAS REHEARSAL? STRESSFUL. WORRISOME. WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD. IT WASN'T. YOU'RE TO BLAME. HOW AM I TO BLAME? I TEXTED YOU, REPEATEDLY. I HAD A BUSY DAY. I NEEDED YOU. TO RUN YOUR ERRANDS. TO TACKLE YOUR TO-DO LIST. CARLTON, THOSE CHORES ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, NOT MINE. I CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON THE BALLET WHILE I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU AND US. THIS IS NOT FAIR OF YOU. I NEED YOU DURING THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN MY LIFE AND MY CAREER. PLEASE, DON'T GUILT-TRIP ME. YOUR BEHAVIOR RIGHT NOW IS WHAT'S NOT FAIR. YOU HAVE NO IDEA, DO YOU? HOW MUCH IT HURTS TO SEE YOU GROW AWAY FROM ME RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES, MAKING ME REGRET THIS... STUPID SEPARATION. I'M GOING OUT. I NEED SOME AIR. I LOVE YOU. SO HE'S A BUTTON-PUSHER. HE IS. BUT THE WAY HE SAID HE LOVED ME... I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE REALIZED THAT WHAT WE HAD WHEN WE STARTED OUT WAS PRETTY SPECIAL, AND WE LOST IT WHEN HE PRIORITIZED HIMSELF. SO ARE YOU HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SPLIT? IT'S KINDA HARD NOT TO IN THIS SITUATION. HMM. WHAT ABOUT DUSTIN? WHAT ABOUT HIM? I SAW SOME SPARKS. I THINK WE'VE ARRIVED AT A GOOD PLACE. THE FRIEND PLACE. WELL, UH, HE IS A GOOD FRIEND TO HAVE. HE'S LOYAL, HE'S FAITHFUL, HE'S FUN, HE IS HONEST, HE DOESN'T MANIPULATE AND PLAY GAMES, YOU KNOW? AND HE ENCOURAGES AND HE CARES. HE'S GOT A LOT MORE TO OFFER THAN JUST BEING THE STEADFAST FRIEND, YOU KNOW? BUT I'M SURE YOU FIGURED THAT OUT DURING YOUR LITTLE ELEVATOR KISS. OKAY. LOOK, MAGIC AND ROMANCE IGNITE A RELATIONSHIP, BUT IT'S THE FRIENDSHIP THAT MAKES IT ENDURE. YOU KNOW, IT'S THE FRIENDSHIP THAT TURNS THAT HAPPILY EVER AFTER INTO THE BEGINNING OF A LOVE STORY, AND NOT THE ENDING. THE BEGINNING IS THE EXCITING PART. BUT IT'S THE REST OF THE STORY THAT'S THE TRUE PART. ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO MARRY HER? NO. WE CALLED OFF THE ENGAGEMENT. [GIRL] THANK GOD. I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOSING YOUR MIND. SHE'S A VERY SPECIAL GIRL, ISN'T SHE? PUPPIES ARE SPECIAL. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR? NO. I WANT PASSION, CLASS AND TALENT. N... NOT HERE. WHY? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? I DON'T WANT TO HURT HER FEELINGS. YOU ALRIGHT? N... YEAH. UH... I JUST THOUGHT THAT I SAW SOMEONE THAT I KNEW. OH. ANYWAY. A FRIENDSHIP, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT FIRST. RIESLING AND MERLOT. INSTEAD OF CHARDONNAY AND PINOT NOIR? -MM. -OKAY. I COME BEARING CATERING GIFTS. REALLY? I MADE 200 FOR YOU TO HAND OUT AT THE COMMUNITY EVENT, AND I SENT EMAILS TO A FEW OF MY PRESS CONTACTS LETTING THEM KNOW THAT YOU ARE CATERING THE PARTY. OH MY GOSH. KAYLA, THAT IS SO SWEET! THANK YOU. WHEN DID YOU DO ALL OF THIS? LAST NIGHT. I PICKED UP THE POST CARDS ON MY WAY HERE THIS MORNING. WHAT ABOUT THE NUTCRACKER ARTIST? DIDN'T YOU WORK ON THE STORY? MM, NO, NOT YET. WHAT DO WE OWE YOU FOR THE POST CARDS AND FOR YOUR TIME? NOTHING. I DID THIS AS A THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU'VE GIVEN ME. BUT YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE, AND I'D LIKE TO PAY YOU FOR IT. NO, I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. AND I DON'T WANT YOU DOING FREE WORK. DUSTIN. I'M SORRY IF I CROSSED A BOUNDARY. NO, IT'S NOT THAT YOU CROSSED A BOUNDARY. IT'S THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SET A BOUNDARY. OKAY. SORRY. I'M GOING TO GO. NO, WAIT, KAYLA! WAIT. KAYLA! DUSTIN, WHY WERE YOU JUST A JERK TO HER? -I WASN'T A JERK. -YES YOU WERE. GO APOLOGIZE. I... DON'T THINK I SHOULD. SHE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT MAKING THESE FOR US. FOR YOU. EXACTLY. AND THAT'S TIME SHE SHOULD HAVE SPENT DOING SOMETHING FOR HERSELF, NOT FOR SOMEONE ELSE. DUSTIN... [BELL JINGLING] OH, HELLO AGAIN. HI, SANTA. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE A WISH COMING TRUE. I WISH I KNEW HOW TO SET BOUNDARIES. DON'T JUST WISH IT, MAKE THEM COME TRUE. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT, AND YOU ARE THE SECOND PERSON TODAY WHO'S ENCOURAGED ME TO DO JUST THAT. [CHUCKLES] MY WISH THEN, IS THAT YOU GET A VERY GOOD CHRISTMAS PRESENT THIS YEAR, SANTA CLAUS. [LAUGHS] YOUR JOYFUL SMILE IS A VERY NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT. WILL YOU HURRY UP AND APOLOGIZE TO HER ALREADY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. SAY YOU'RE SORRY FOR BEING UNGRATEFUL. I WAS GRATEFUL. I AM GRATEFUL. THE CARDS ARE WONDERFUL. TELL HER, NOT ME. SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING ON HER STORY. HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER GENEROSITY AND I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THAT. YOU HURT HER FEELINGS, DUSTIN. YOU GOTTA MAKE IT UP TO HER. [CELL PHONE BEEPS] [CHUCKLES] YAY. [CELL PHONE BEEPS] THAT'S... SERIOUSLY... COOL. I BETTER GET A SIGNED COPY OF YOUR BOOK. THANK YOU. OK. I'M REALLY GLAD YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND, DUSTIN. YEAH, ME TOO. IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO UNITE THESE DOGS WITH THEIR OWNERS OR FIND THEM FOREVER HOMES. WE GOT A LOT OF REALLY NICE DOGS HERE. WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE BARKLY A VERY HAPPY HOME, I PROMISE. WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. IT'S OKAY, BARKLY. -CAN I OPEN IT UP? ALRIGHT. -OF COURSE. OH, HI, BARKLY. HEY, BUDDY. THERE HE IS. AW. ARE YOU REALLY HAPPY? DO YOU WANT TO COME HOME WITH ME? -DO YOU? -HE'S HAPPY. GOOD, I'M HAPPY TOO. LET'S GO HOME. ALRIGHT, COME ON. [NO AUDIO] [NO AUDIO] -I THINK I'LL GO TRANSLATE. -WHY AREN'T YOU ON? WHY AREN'T YOU ON TV ALREADY? [LAUGHING] YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME. I WAS JUST... [CELL PHONE RINGS] YOU SHOULD GET THAT. YEAH. HI, CARLTON. HELLO KAYLA, WHERE ARE YOU? I'M AT THE TREE FUNDRAISING EVENT. I TEXTED YOU THE INFORMATION. SOMETHING WRONG? I NEED TO SEE YOU IMMEDIATELY OKAY, I'M ON MY WAY. IT WAS CARLTON. YEAH. I HEARD. HE SOUNDED WEIRD. I THINK SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. IT SOUNDS IMPORTANT. YOU SHOULD GO. OKAY. I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME WITH YOU TODAY. ME TOO. -BYE. -BYE. WHAT'S GOING ON? I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT US. CARLTON. YOU NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON THE BALLET. I CAN'T. YOU ARE... MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. I'M WHAT? YOU... ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO ME, KAYLA. I... LOOK, I KNOW I NEED TO SHOULDER MOST OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT WENT WRONG. I'M... TOUGH, I'M OPINIONATED, I'M POMPOUS, I'M A PERFECTIONIST, I'VE LIVED MOST OF MY CAREER FOR MYSELF, BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE. I... WANT OUR MAGIC BACK, LIKE IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING, ONCE UPON A TIME. WILL YOU GIVE ME A SECOND CHANCE? IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. THAT WOULD BE PRESUMPTUOUS. THE COLORS OF CHRISTMAS. TO REMIND YOU OF OUR FRESH START... IF YOU'LL HAVE ME, OF COURSE. SLEEP ON IT? CAN YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT? YES, OF COURSE, DARLING, OF COURSE. HO, HO, HO! A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS. -GOOD MORNING, SANTA. -GOOD MORNING, SMILES. OH... WHERE'S THE SMILE? I NEED A WISH ABOUT TRUE LOVE. AH, THE ORIGINAL WISH WE SPOKE OF. ARE YOU NOW WISHING FOR THAT ROMANTIC SPARK TO BE REIGNITED? I'M NOT QUITE SURE. [CHUCKLING] WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT. -MERRY CHRISTMAS. HO, HO, HO. -MERRY CHRISTMAS. BYE-BYE. COME IN. ARE YOU OKAY? NO. CARLTON WANTS ANOTHER CHANCE. HE WANTS TO MAKE IT WORK BETWEEN US. OH. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BY THE WAY. FROM CARLTON? YEAH. DUSTIN... WELL, I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AND... ALL THE HAPPINESS, OKAY? I REALLY DO. OKAY, THEN. I GUESS THIS IS FOR THE BEST. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. YEAH, I'M GRATEFUL TOO. FOR ALL THE SPECIAL TIMES THAT WE HAD. THEY WERE PRETTY WONDERFUL. YEAH, THEY WERE. I SCREWED THAT UP, DIDN'T I? SHE'S RIGHT, THIS IS FOR THE BEST. HERE WE ARE, LADIES, AND LIFTING. AND LIFTING, YES, EXACTLY. LIFTING. LIFT IT UP, THROUGH THE ENTIRE JUMP. STOP. STOP. OKAY, UH, IT'S GOING VERY WELL. BECOME LIKE CONFETTI! LET'S MAKE THIS WORK. I LOVE YOU, DARLING. [KIM] I'VE NEVER BEEN MIFFED AT YOU BEFORE. WE'VE HAD OUR STRESSFUL WORK ENVIRONMENTS- I MEAN, DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS, YEAH, BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN MIFFED AT YOU OR DISAPPOINTED IN YOU UNTIL NOW. HOW COULD YOU LET HER JUST WALK OUT OF YOUR LIFE? SHE LEFT PRETTY QUICKLY AND PRETTY WILLINGLY. DUSTIN, YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT FOR HER! STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND TOLD HER HOW YOU REALLY FEEL! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I DON'T KNOW. I'M GOING TO GET YOU SOME CATS, BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU'RE GOING TO BE A CRAZY OLD CAT PERSON. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU STARTED LAYING EGGS. I'M NOT CHICKEN. I'M NOT CHICKEN, AM I, BOY? [CARLTON] 1 AND 2 AND 3. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS] STOP, STOP, STOP! THIS IS NOT WHAT I ASKED. IT IS NOT. I ASKED REPEATEDLY, PLEASE... BACK WITH CARLTON? -AND, 1, 2, 3... -BACK WITH CARLTON. I CAN TELL, STOP! IT'S NOT WORKING. IT'S NOT WORKING! YESTERDAY IT SEEMED LIKE YOU AND DUSTIN WERE REALLY CONNECTING. YEAH, WELL, THE WHOLE WORLD CAN CHANGE IN A MOMENT, REALLY. RUN OFF THE STAGE. RUN OFF THE STAGE! SO THEN HOW COME IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THE CHANGE? NOW GO BACK ONTO THE STAGE. IT'S BEEN AN OVERWHELMING FEW DAYS. I'M SURE THINGS WILL GET BACK TO NORMAL ONCE CARLTON AND I ARE BACK IN LOS ANGELES. -AND, 1, 2, 3... -WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT AFTER THE FESTIVITIES. I NEED TO GET BACK HOME. OKAY, I SEE... I SEE YOU ON MY SET. PLEASE LEAVE MY SET, THANK YOU. [JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING] -HEY, CAN YOU HAND THESE OUT? THANK YOU. -SURE. HEY, KAYLA. HI. I LET HIM HAVE IT. -FULL ROUND OF AMMUNITION. -[SIGHS] KIM. I CALLED HIM A CAT LADY, AND A CHICKEN. [CHUCKLES] KIM. WHAT, IT'S TRUE! YOU TWO BELONG TOGETHER. -IT'S SO OBVIOUS. -HI GUYS. THINGS ARE THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE. OH YEAH? THEN WHY DO YOU LOOK SO MISERABLE? HI. AND WHY DOES DUSTIN LOOK SO MISERABLE? WAIT, IS... IS HE HERE? NO, HE WAS TO SET UP, BUT THEN HE LEFT BECAUSE HE FELT IT MIGHT BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU IF HE WAS HERE. IT IS WHAT IT IS. BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. IF YOU JUST TOLD HIM THAT YOU LOVED HIM, THEN-- KIM, I AM WITH CARLTON NOW, OKAY? HE'S CHANGED, AND HE'S TRYING, WHICH IS-- WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR DUSTIN. OH, GOOD EVENING, LOVE! YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. OH! [BREATHES DEEPLY] GET ME A GLASS OF WINE, WOULD YOU, DARLING? OH, AND YOU NEED TO CONTACT THE ARTS EDITOR AT THE DAILY NEWS. THE ARTICLE ABOUT ME WAS BOTTOM OF FRONT PAGE AND NOT TOP. REALLY? THIS IS OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY AND YOU ARE STILL BOSSING ME AROUND? OH, I'M SORRY, DARLING, I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. IT'S JUST THAT EVERY MOMENT IS CRITICAL. WE'RE OPENING TOMORROW NIGHT. I'M SO SORRY, SWEETUMS, I JUST SEE SOMEONE OVER THERE THAT I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SPEAK TO. EXCUSE ME. [SIGHS] I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THEM BUT... I SAW THEM GETTING COZY THE OTHER DAY AT THE HOTEL WHEN WE WERE SITTING AT THE BAR. OH, YOU MEAN WHEN WE WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING A MAN WHO IS YOUR FRIEND? A MAN WHO RESPECTS YOU? YEAH, PRETTY MUCH. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO GIVE CARLTON A PIECE OF MY MIND. ARE YOU SURE? OH, I AM MORE SURE THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE BEFORE. WE ARE OFFICIALLY DONE. [CHUCKLING] I BEG YOUR PARDON? THE SPARK IS GONE, CARLTON. LOOK, I KNOW YOU LOVE ME, AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, BUT AS A COUPLE, WE DO NOT WORK. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO TRY. [GASPS] I DID, AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN GONE A FULL DAY AND WE'RE ALREADY BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE THAT NEEDED TO BE CHANGED. I NEED A LOVE THAT DEEPENS AND GROWS EACH DAY WITH A PARTNER WHO RESPECTS ME AND INSPIRES ME AS MUCH AS I'D INSPIRE HIM. CARLTON, YOU ARE AN AMAZING DIRECTOR AND CHOREOGRAPHER. YOU ARE AN AMAZING PERSON, AND THE BALLET YOU CHOREOGRAPHED WILL BE AMAZING. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE THERE. GO BE AMAZING. I... HOPE YOU FIND THAT LOVE. HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW? BACK TO LOS ANGELES. SHOULD WE...? SHOULD WE...? -YEAH, WE SHOULD. YEAH. -YEAH. YEAH. -KAYLA! -KAYLA! -WHERE ARE YOU HEADED? -THE AIRPORT. AH. CAN I GET YOU A CAB? NO. WAIT. YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR MIND, HUH? YEAH. WHAT, DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A STRONG WOMAN? [CHUCKLES] NOPE. COME ON, BOY. COME HERE. YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF CATS, DO YOU? I AM BEING A CHICKEN, AREN'T I? I SHOULD GO GET HER? LET'S DO THIS. COME ON. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [CLATTERING] OH NO. WHY DO I ALWAYS FORGET TO TAKE THE STAIRS? [SIGHS] THE DAMN ELEVATOR! WHAT'S WRONG? THE ELEVATOR'S STUCK FOR GOOD THIS TIME. IT HASN'T MOVED IN 30 MINUTES. THANKS A LOT, ELEVATOR. YOU BROUGHT THE MOST INCREDIBLE WOMAN INTO MY LIFE, AND NOW YOU'RE STOPPING ME FROM GETTING TO HER. DUSTIN? [DUSTIN] I AM A CHICKEN, OKAY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR? I PRACTICALLY ROLLED OUT THE RED CARPET FOR KAYLA TO LEAVE ME. AND NOW WHEN I WANT TO GO GET HER, TO STOP HER FROM LEAVING, TO... TO TELL HER HOW AMAZING SHE IS... AND HOW I WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH HER, LOVING HER, BEING HER BEST FRIEND, HER PARTNER IN CRIME, YOU'RE FOILING MY EFFORTS! THANKS A LOT, ELEVATOR. WHO'S KAYLA? I'M KAYLA. [ELEVATOR ENGINE STARTS] [GASPS] THANK YOU, ELEVATOR. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] THE, UH... THE ELEVATOR INTERCOM WAS ON. YOU ALL HEARD THAT? MM-HM. I HEARD IT. THAT'S WHAT MATTERS. [KAYLA CHUCKLES] [ALL SHOUTING] WHAT'S WRONG? I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE MET YOU. YOU'RE THE MOST AMAZING WOMAN I'VE EVER MET. AND I NEVER KNEW I COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH MY BEST FRIEND. KAYLA HANSEN...
