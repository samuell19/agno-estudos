Cool. C'mon, give me a hand with this. What if your dad sees us? Don't worry, he's in the backyard. Let's go. Cool. (PHONE RINGING) I'll get it. Hello? Oh, hi, Mom. Yeah, just about. You'd think we were packing the entire house out. Hey, Kevin, you really going to do this? Have to, I've got to beat my dad's record. Mom, calm down. I'm not the first woman in the world to get pregnant. No, he doesn't know yet, that's what this vacation's for. I'm going to get him nice and relaxed and then I'm going to break it to him very genlty. -Break what to me? -Uh, there's no dinner. -Hmm. -Listen, there's a, there's a lot of packing to do so... Hi, Gloria. Oh, it's going to be a great trip, here she is. Yeah, listen, Mom, there's a lot of stuff. Hmm, yeah, I'll tell you what, I'll call you when we get there. Okay, I love you too. Bye. Can we just forget about the packing and concentrate on the stuff? -Oh, no, no, no, we got to pack. -Come on. -Lucky? -What's for dinner? -Anything but pizza, I cannot look at another pizza. -Okay. -I'll ask Kevin. Where's he? -Um, he was inside the house. Kevin? Anything but pizza, pal. Okay, I'm ready. Kevin! Kevin! Oh, no! Kevin, no! Kevin! Oh, no, Kevin! -Are you all right? Are you ok? -Yeah! Are you hurt? Come on, what were you thinking? You could have been seriously hurt. -Are you sure you're okay? -Yeah. What happened? What happened? Centrifugal force, that's what happened. You had too much speed and inertia to make a turn that sharp, didn't you feel yourself go air-borne? -Really, cool. -Really. Are you mad? No, I'm not mad. I'm just glad you're in one piece, for our big trip tomorrow. -So, you think I beat you? -What do you mean? The soapbox. You said you only went twenty-five. I went faster, I beat you, didn't I? Yeah, I guess you did. You beat Lucky Singer's downhill speed record. Come on, let's go. Uh, he's finally asleep. What was that boy thinking about? Did you see that helmet? -He could have killed himself. -He's his father's son. (CHUCKLES) Look, you know what he's doing, don't you? He's competing with me. He needs your attention desperately, and, I'm in the way. Oh, honey, no, I mean look, I know it's been difficult. But think about how difficult it is for Kevin. I mean, first the divorce, and then watching his mother die. Oh, honey, I know that. I know that. My heart goes out to him. All I'm saying is, I don't think he's ever going to accept me as a parent. Sure he will. He just needs some time. Give him some time. Lucky, you know, how we talked about having a baby? Yeah. Not now, you don't mean now? I mean, now's not the time. We've got to wait 'till Kevin's, you know, settled, and this pain is behind him. Hey, we will. We will. Just not now. -C'mon, Dad. Can we go see it? -In a minute. We have to wait for George Bouchard. Aw, man, why do we have to wait for him? -Well, first of all, he's got our tickets. -Free tickets. I still don't know why he wouldn't let us pay. This guy is up to something, I'm telling you right now. -You are so suspicious, he's very generous. -No, I'm sorry. Especially now that he's practically running the company. -Connie, Lucky! -Hey, George. Wow, look at you. Aren't you sharp? Well, it comes from good, clean corporate living. And might I say that you look terrific out of uniform. Perhaps I should rephrase that. -You don't have to, George, we all get it. -Oh, come on, Lucky. You won, I lost, she married you. I'll just pine away for the rest of my life. -Dad, what's he talking about? -I'll tell you when we're all very old men. Wow. I see that you've been taking your growing pills every morning. Kevin, this is for you. Hey, look at that. You are now an official Americana Engineer. Thanks, Mr. Bouchard. Can we go see it now? Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's all taken care of. I told them that the train is not leaving the station, until you have personally inspected the cockpit. -The cockpit? -Oh yeah. Wait until you see it. Wave of the future. You give Americana Rail five years, and it'll wipe out commuter air service. Ok, wait a minute here. Did I hear right? A year ago, you were the airline's number two check pilot and now you're a dyed-in-the-wool rail man? Oh, not 'rail'. Luxury mass transportation. I mean, we all know that flying is a hassle. On Americana Rail, the trip itself is a relaxing vacation. That's why I wanted you to, personally experience it. Compliments of Americana Rail. -So sweet. Thank you. My pleasure. Relax and enjoy. Oh, yeah, like the last trip we took together. Listen, you two go on ahead. I'll get our seats, all right? Can you take my bag? -Okay. -Thanks. Oh, and Lucky, the pilot's name is Earl Hobkins. Pilot? Come on, let's go. I'll show you. Boy, this is going to be so much fun, I love trains. Did I ever tell you, my Dad, um, when I was a little boy, he got me this train. Wasn't even electric. You had to wind the thing up with a key, but you know, it was special. I mean, I was the only kid on the block who had one. How long ago was that, Dad? It was a long time ago. Before there was dirt, all right? Is that what you're looking for? -Hey, Kev, look here. Here it is, the engine, huh? -Nice. They've got steel throttles and valves, they've got pressure gauges the size of pizza pans in here. -Pizza pans? -Yeah, wait 'till you see. The smell of oil and grease, that's a man's place, I'm telling ya, you're going to love it. Okay. Hello. We're looking for Mr. Hobkins, the engineer. Well, you found him. Are you the guys that Bouchard sent over? Yeah, I'm Lucky Singer. This is my son, Kevin. Ah, nice to meet you. Call me Earl. Hey, you like trains, kid? -Yeah. -Yeah, come on, over here, have a seat. Take a look at the cockpit. Cockpit, huh? But you know, this is not what I expected. I mean, where's all the gears and the throttles and the levers and the pulleys, ya know? You know, all the good stuff. Don't need it anymore. Everything you need to run my baby is right in there. -Oh, don't tell me computers? -What, do you got something against them? Oh, nothing personal, I just don't like the idea of trusting a couple of transistors with the safety of a hundred and fifty passengers. Hey, these babies are foolproof. Yeah, right. Come here, let me show you something. Here it is. Computerized train of the future. It's electric, Dad. Oh, it's a diesel, right? No, your boy is right. People still call them diesels, but it's an electromotive engine. All the diesel does back there is power the generators to make electricity. This is the control center. Come in. Hang on a sec. This is Grand Royale. Go ahead, control. Uh, Grand Royale, we got a hold for you. Looks like five to ten minutes, max. Copy that, control. What's the hold? -Come on. -This is your lucky day, Earl. The company's hosting a congressional fact-finding, delegation on your very own train, and guess what, they're running late. Yeah, well, it's a wonder they're running at all. Standing by, control. Ten-four. I can't believe it. You've got a global positioning satellite system on the train? It's the same as on your airplane, nothing but the best. But a G.P.S. on a train? What for? I mean, on a plane, you need a reliable navigation system, but you're hardly going to get lost on the rails. Ah, it's just so the desk jockeys up in control center can keep track of all the trains we have out there. Hey, you guys want something to drink? Oh, no thanks. We'd better get back. Thanks for the tour. Not a problem. Enjoy your trip. -Goodbye. No. -Oh, you're not coming? -I've got an appointment. -Thanks again, George. All right. Bye-bye. Have a good time. Gee, honey, what'd you do? Pack your rock collection in here? -Come on, Ben, I'll take it. -No, it's no problem, I'm fit. That's not what your doctor says. I think I'll get a second opinion on that. Excuse me, ma'am, do I look fit to you? -Absolutely. -Thanks. Ben Hofflund. Hofflund Insurance. Life, casualty, homeowners. "You play, we pay." Ben, we're on vacation. You're not acting like this all the way to San Francisco, are you? Just relax and enjoy the train ride. Trains, I'd rather fly, it's a lot quicker. Excuse me, ma'am? You like to fly? Well, that's a trick question, actually, I'm a pilot. -Really? -Oh, well, congratulations. It's about time they put a woman in charge. Maybe planes will start flying on time now. You know, statistically, per passenger mile, airline travel is still the safest... Ben, enough. Leave your work at the office. -Oh, ok. -Thanks. Senator Brumfest, how are you? Nice to see you again. Welcome to Americana Rail. Sandy Holmestead My, my, look at you. Vice President of public relations. Well, actually Senior Vice President. Oh, yes, we can't forget the 'senior' part, can we? You know, I know what it takes for a woman to get her stripes these days. You've come a long way, Sandy. Hi, how are you? Armond Brumfest, nice to see you. Hey, Kev, listen, before we get on the train, look, I know how difficult it's been the last few months on you. And well, on everybody, but especially on you. All the changes and including Connie. But we're going to be on this train together, ya know? And I want you to try to understand her feelings, too. Yeah, but she's not my mom. She tries to act like it, but she's not. Hey, hey, listen we know that. Nobody knows it better than Connie, nobody can replace your mom. Nobody's trying to. Connie's very fond of you. She is. And we're going to be together a lot of years. She doesn't have to be your mom to be your friend. Huh? -Will you give it a chance? -Yeah, okay. -Huh? Huh? -Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right. -Hey, it's going to be fun. -A lot of fun. I have no doubt that this trip will clearly demonstrate why privately owned and managed passenger rail transportation is so far superior to the government run rail system. And you believe that this little railroad of yours can do all that? Senator, I promise you, you're in for the ride of your life. Shall we? Hey, Kev, this is great, isn't it? Really nice. Hi, Can I help you, sir? Oh, I'm just looking for my wife. Oh, she's probably up in the main salon. I'm sorry, you look very familiar. Do I know you? No, I don't think so. Let's go. I guess you've just got one of those familiar faces. Yeah, I guess so. -Hey. -Hey. Look at this place, huh? Is George right, or what? It's like stepping back in time. -I know. -It's like a Bogart movie. It's unbelievable. And it's very luxurious. I'm telling you, if we had this on our planes, the passengers would never leave. So, how was the engine? It was okay. -Just okay? -Come on, champ. I mean, it was really cool. I mean, they hardly need an engineer up there, It's like one big computer chip on wheels. You know what, sweetheart? Some time you're just going to have to grasp that computers are not a passing fad. I know that. I know we need to use them. But I don't have to like them. Right, Kev? Yeah, right, Dad. (CHUCKLES) Cut crystals for the passengers that want service at their seats. -And these are for interior bar service. -Okay. Don't worry about it. You're doing a good job. A few runs, you'll be doing it in your sleep. Oh, and before I forget, the kids get plastic. You'll get flak from some of the parents, so... Got it. Can I get a drink, please? Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We don't start serving until the train gets moving. Hey, aren't you Scott Sparkman? Yeah. Man, what a tough break, Sparky. Boy, I bet you wish you had a chance to do it all over again, huh? Listen, call me when I can get a drink, okay? What was that about? -Nothing. -Are you somebody famous or something? Me? No. Then how come everybody seems to recognize you? I used to play some football. -Oh, football player. -Ex-football player. Dropped a pass in a big game on national TV. I'm going to go get some ice. -As I was saying... -Yeah. No, no, no. Senator Brumfest, Sir, what a pleasure. How are you? Nice to see you. Business, pleasure, Ben Hofflund, Hofflund Insurance. Sorry about that. Here's our dining car, of course, and bar. Who's that? Senator somebody. This is our beautiful bar. And this is the private lounge section, reserved for you and your guests. Oh, uh... Excuse me. There seems to be a little bit of a mix up here. You see, this particular lounge section is reserved. And I apologize, but I'm going to have to ask you all to move. Reserved? What are you talking about, reserved? There's no sign saying reserved. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. But I represent Americana Rail, and I'm afraid I'm going have to insist that you all move to other seats. Have a nice trip. Oh, here, let me help you with that. Thank you. You've helped enough. So, make yourself comfortable. -Can I help you? -Thank you. -Oh, can I bother you for a moment? -What? Would you mind holding my baby? -I just have to use the washroom. -Oh, sure. Thank you. Come here. Oh, my goodness. -Thanks. -Sure. Don't even think about it. Hi, it's Sandy. Yep, all tucked in and ready to roll. Let's get this show on the road. Gotcha. Sit down, sit back and enjoy the ride. We're hitting the turbs. You're good to go, Grand Royale. Earl, I'll take you out from here. Copy that, control. Y'know, Wilson, this thing almost drives itself. I don't doubt that for a second, my man. But you know how much I love this part. All aboard! (HONKING) Kevin, come on, enough with the game. Look out the window, we're going. Look how nice, huh? Nice trees, Dad. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for these tickets. We're from the Cantil area, as well. I have an insurance company. I've been the top insurance... Well, this is my vacation... (BELLS TOLLING) Hey, Earl, what the hell's going on there, buddy? Uh, everything's okay. I'll check it out. (FIRE ALARM RINGING) -What was that? -I don't know. -You all right? -Yeah, I'm ok. What's happening? I don't know, but I'm going to find out, all right? You stay put. Is everybody all right? Are you being helped? You all right, sir? -Are you all right? -Yeah. What happened? -I don't know. -Is everybody all right? You all right, sir? -Is everything ok? Is everything ok? -Everything's fine, sir. Well, what happened? Did we bump into something... I think, I think we're all right now. Yes, well, I certainly hope so, Sandy. I want you to stop the train. I've got to get off. Please. -Oh, please sir. -I've gotta get off! Be calm, please. Be calm. We're going to be stopping in Whittier very soon, all right? I want you to sit down, stay calm. I'll go up front and I'll make sure everything's all right. Okay? Earl, what the hell is going on up here? Nothing, a glitch. A glitch? Don't tell me a glitch. I got passengers on the verge of panic, and some of them are injured. And I'm telling you, everything is fine now, okay? Now get out of here, get back to those passengers and take care of them. Charlie, everything is okay. Lucky, what was that? I don't know. But something's definitely wrong. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? This is your conductor speaking. You may have noticed that we have experienced a mechanical glitch. But as you can see, everything is fine now. Whittier will be our first stop today. Any passengers requiring assistance, please let one of the train attendants know. Thank you. Some mechanical glitch. I don't know, I really think I ought to check it out. Lucky, it sounds like they have everything under control. Just sit down. Everything's going to be okay, isn't it, Dad? Yeah, son. Everything's all right. (ALARM SOUNDS) Control, this is Grand Royale. Listen, we've got a problem. Yeah, copy that, Earl, I'm already on it. Mr. Reddick, what do you think? Amps are way out of whack. It's not right. There's a computer glitch. Have him try manual hard boot. -That should clear it up. -Grand Royale, this is control. Hey, Earl, it looks to us like a small computer glitch, that's all. We'd like you to manually reboot. Over. Copy that, control. Rebooting. Ben, are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. -You want a glass of water or something? -I'm fine. I was just a little shaken, that's all. Miss, that was that was quite a jolt, did we hit something? What happened? It was a little mechanical thing. I'm sure the engineer's got everything under control. Sorry about the bumpy start. -Can I get you something to drink? -Sure. Water would be fine. -Okay. -Thank you. Can I get you anything to drink? Yeah, hey, give me a double vodka tonic, will you? Yes, sir, I'll take care of that. How's she doing? I think we're going to need some more ice for her head. I'm going to call ahead to Whittier, make sure they have an EMS team standing by. I think that's a very good idea, Sandy, because we're going to be getting off there, too. So you'd better make sure there's some transportation ready for us. -But, Senator, you haven't even seen the rest of the... -I've seen enough, Sandy. I've seen quite enough. You can't really expect me to support a subsidy for this. Obviously, this has never happened to us before. Surely, you're not going to judge us on just one incident. Incident? You call this an incident? Let me tell you something. Your company, it's in a whole lot of trouble. -Excuse me. -Excuse me. Yes, Sir. My name is Singer. I used to work with George Bouchard. -Ah, yes. -That was quite a bump. Yes, it certainly was. How are the passengers in the other cars? Well, there's no major injuries, just a few bumps and bruises. And what about the train? Well, the engineer assures me that it's just a glitch. Well, if there's any way I can be of assistance. I appreciate that, Mr. Singer. You know, we'll be arriving at Whittier pretty soon, perhaps you can help us out then. -Thanks. -Thank you. Check out the amps, they're red lining. The engine should have shut itself down. Copy that, Earl. We're checking it out from here. Just hang tight, buddy. Could it be a cable? -A loose cable wouldn't give us a red line. -Maybe a fuse then? A good possibility. Look, I guess we're going to have to shut the train down until we figure it out. That delegation already made us lose twenty minutes. -How long 'till the train pulls into Whittier? -Eighteen minutes. -Then we wait. -Excuse me, Mr. Reddick, if it's a serious problem, those eighteen minutes are going to be crucial. We should stop the train now. All right, brake it and have your pilot check the master fuse. Grand Royale, this is control. We think it's a master fuse, Earl. We want you to stop the train where you are, go out to the main panel and check the fuses. Over. Copy that, control. Brake train and check fuses. Control, this is Grand Royale. Dynamic brakes are unresponsive, repeat, dynamic brakes are unresponsive. The stick is dead, Wilson, I'm not getting anything out of her. Copy that, Earl. Hold on, I'll put you on speaker. Dynamic traction brakes are not responding. Earl, this is Eric Reddick. You're going to have to use the independent engine air brakes. We're going too fast for that. It could blow the hoses. I realize that. So I want you to shut down the main generators. Let the traction motors kick in, then hit the air brakes. That's the first thing that I tried, the genies aren't responding, either. This doesn't make sense. Something's not right there, Earl. Do you remember anything odd when you pulled out? Anything at all? No, nothing. I don't have a clue what's going on. Okay, double cherry for you. -Natural soda for you. -Thanks. What's a five letter word for offspring? I don't know. Child. You still worried? Well, yeah, I'm still worried. It just doesn't feel right to me. I know. But you talked to the conductor, right? Oh, I did. But that was quite a jolt... -I'm just going to use the restroom. -It's not a plane. I understand it's not a plane. (GASPS) Ben! Oh, my God, Ben! Ben! Oh, God! Get something for his head. Get a jacket... Ma'am, does your husband have a heart condition, ma'am? Oh, my God! Ben! Stay with us. Does he have a heart condition? -No! I don't know... -What's happening? I don't know. You have a doctor on board? -I'll go look. -Okay. -Is there anything I can do? -His pulse is weak. Oxygen. You got portable oxygen? Right, yeah. -And blankets and maybe a pillow. -Okay. Is there a doctor on board? Okay, excuse me. Could you sit down? -It's okay. Could you sit down, please? Where's the oxygen? Coming! Here, put that on him, okay? -Okay. -Here we go. -Turn it on. -It's on. -It's okay. -He's not responding. Oh, my God, Ben, please! No, no. I want to stay with him, please! All right. Okay, hang in there, buddy. Earl, we need you to go out and check the main fuses. Yeah. You guys are right. It's got to, it's got to be the mains. I'll go check them. Ben, I'm here. We've got to get him off this train. Is he going to be okay? If he gets help soon, I think so. My mom got help. Excuse me, is everything all right? Well, the house phones don't seem to be working right. -And we should be slowing for Whittier right about now. -We're speeding up. Yeah, I'm going to find a phone. -Sandy. A word with you, please. -Sure. How's he doing? He's going to be just fine, as long as we can get him to a hospital pretty soon. Well, if there's anything that we can do, please let us know. I appreciate that, Senator, Thank you. -Can you excuse me for a second? -Sure. -Sandy? -Yeah, what's up? The engineer's not picking up in the cab. We're supposed to be slowing down for Whittier right now and... we're not. Have you been able to use your telephone in here? Sure, I just used it. -Can I borrow it to phone the control tower? -Sure. -Thank you. Excuse me for a second. -Sure. Hi, it's Charlie. Can you tell me what's going on down here? Charlie, this is Wilson and Eric. Listen, you've got an electrical problem up front. The computers are down, and so are the traction brakes. And right now, your speed is increasing, two miles an hour every minute. Earl went out to the panel to check the fuses and we can't get a hold of him. Earl went out? That's why he's not picking up the phone. Charlie, listen to me, I need you to go up front and see what's going on. Unless I get some answers here, my gut tells me we've got a runaway train. I understand. Okay. -What's wrong? -Plenty. Thank you. Excuse me, excuse me, aren't we going kind of fast to be stopping at Whittier? I'm just checking that out now, ma'am. Hey! It's not good, is it? No! It isn't! I hate it when I'm right. We're not slowing down? We'll have to go out and check those fuses. I'm coming with you. Can't permit that, sir, it's against regulations. Oh, don't worry. I won't tell anyone. No, passengers are not allowed up there, sir. Watch your step. Okay. I hate tunnels! Excuse me. -Why didn't we stop at Whittier? -I don't know. Okay, Kevin, go back to the booth and wait for me. I'm going to go up front. -Me, too. -No, no, no. Wait here. I'll be right back. No, I wanna go with you. Kevin, please, I'm asking you to wait here for me. I'm just going to make sure everything's okay. I'll keep an eye on him. Thanks. Control center, come in, please. Can you hear me? -Anything? -No, nothing. I don't think this thing's working. -Connie! -Lucky, what's going on? What happened? The main fuse box blew. The engineer must've been on the catwalk when it exploded. He's gone. -What? -I'm trying to get through to the control center. But I don't think it's working. -So who's running the train? -Right now, nobody. -We're a runaway. -Why can't you? No, ma'am. I'm not qualified to run one of these computerized trains. Computers. We've got to get in touch with George Bouchard. What about the cell phone? Does it work out here? I can try. It's ringing. Here. I've gotta get back to my passengers. Excuse me. Hey, where you going? What's taking them so long? Your mom said to stay here. She's not my mom. She's sort of my step mom. Step mom's kind of tough on you, hey? No, not really. -You've got it pretty good. -Why? 'Cause I didn't get along with mine. -Anything new? -Yes, they found Earl. He's dead. This train is officially a runaway. Mr. Bouchard, I've got Lucky Singer on line one. I'm going to patch him through. Yeah, yeah. Just get him on the line. -I'll go back and check on Kevin. -Okay. Be careful. Be careful. -Hey, Lucky. -George. George, if I remember correctly, the last time we went on a little airplane trip together, we relied on computers. Do you remember what happened that time, George? Yeah, well, don't remind me. -Now, listen... -No, you listen. The next time I see you, George, we better not be within five hundred miles of a plane, train, car, bus or anything else with wheels or wings on it. Do you hear me? Now just tell me how to stop the damn train. Well, we're working on a couple of scenarios here. Well, look, just give me some numbers, all right? Yeah uh, Amp meter, dead. Oil pressure gauge, dead. Tachometer, dead. -Manifold pressure... -Dead. All right, I get the picture. Anything working? The GPS. How 'bout that? A navigational system. Like this train is going to get lost in the woods or something. Now listen, George, we've got a critically ill person on board. If we can't stop immediately, we're going to have to airlift him off. Um, look Lucky, that's not possible. I want you to put the map overlay on the GPS. You see where you are? You're heading up into the mountains. It's windy, it's forested. There's no way we're going to get an EMS chopper in there now. Mr. Bouchard, I think we got something. Your man has to get into the main generator. Uh, Lucky, I think we've got this figured out. This better be good, George. Yeah, just hang tight, all right? Okay, gentlemen. Just take a seat. Mrs. Hofflund. -How's he doing? -I don't know. His pulse is stronger. That's encouraging. It's a good sign. Look, we have to get Ben to a hospital. Why didn't we stop in Whittier? -When is this train going to stop? -Soon, very soon. But we have to stop the train. My husband needs to get to a hospital. Look, Mrs. Hofflund, they're doing everything they can. There's something wrong, isn't there? I mean, that's why this train isn't stopping. Sandy? Anyway, as far as I can make out, one of the fuses are blown. That caused a malfunction. Malfunction? What kind of malfunction? What's going on here? Senator, please. We're trying not to scare the other passengers. Well, I think if there is a malfunction, we all have a right to know about it. What we know is we have a problem. And there's someone on it right now. Lucky, you're going to have to get into the generator compartment. Generator compartment. Lucky, can you hear me? I want you to go down the catwalk. It should be right in front of you, on the left. It's an electrical panel box with yellow stripes. Yeah, yeah, right. You see it? No, hang on. It's like the Fourth of July in here. Lucky? Lucky, do you see it? Yeah, yeah, Danger High Voltage. Right here, black and yellow. Yeah, that's the one. Just be careful. Okay, I'm there. You want to run this past me again? Okay, what we're trying to do is override the computer and brake the train. The braking system on the train are called dynamic brakes. They work by reversing the polarity of the electricity to the motors. Just think of them like the reverse thrusters on a plane. What I want you to do is manually reverse the two lead wires, positive to negative. Do you see it? Oh, oh, and Lucky, when you open the box, there might be an electrostatic charge. Thanks for telling me. -Do you see the lead wires? -I see what's left of them. The lead wires are fused to the terminals. The surge must have melted them. There's no way to get them off to reverse them. Forget this option. -What's Plan B? -Fitch? I wish I had one. There you go. Is there anything else I can get for you ladies? Scott, Scott, can I talk to you please for a minute? What is it? I have a situation I need your help with. There's been an accident. Earl, the engineer, he's gone. He went out to check the fuses and he fell off the train. Fell off the train? What are we going to do? Right now, Mr. Singer is in touch with George Bouchard at the control center. Wait, wait, why Mr. Singer? Well, he and Bouchard, they, they go way back. They used to be pilots together or something. Anyway, the point is, I need your help to keep the passengers calm. All right? I don't want any panic. Is it that bad? I don't know. I don't know. Ow! Oh! -What happened? -I hit my head on the fuel line. Hey, George, if we can't kill this beast, why can't we starve it to death? You know what, Lucky, that's worth a try. But it's not going to be as easy as you think. You're going to have to go into the turbine area, under the grate. Eight miles from Granite Peak. -He's never going to make it. -Well, he can try. All right, what's it look like? The shut-off valve has a red handle. -Do you see it? -Yeah, I got it. Now be very careful because there are a lot of other handles in that area. -(HISSING) -Ah! Ow! -Are you okay? -No, I'm blind. -Did you find the valve? -Well, there's two red valves. It's the one with the long, thin handle. Why didn't you tell me? -(SCREECHING) -(HISSING) Got it. Got it. (HORN BLOWING) Nothing's happening. Sounds the same, feels the same. No, no, no. It's happening. It just doesn't happen as quickly as on a car or a plane. Listen, Lucky, what I want you to do is go back to the cab -and check your GPS. -Fine. (ELECTRICAL BUZZING) Lucky, one-two, one-two, one-two. Lucky, can you hear me? Can you hear me? George, I can hear you through the system. It's working all of a sudden. -Go ahead. -All right, this is what the situation is, Lucky. -You mean there's more? -Yeah, I'm afraid so. Lucky, trains are all about momentum. Momentum to get going, momentum to try to stop. A train your size normally takes a couple of miles to come to a complete stop. Will you get to the point, George? Even with the fuel valve shut off, there's still enough fuel in the line to keep the diesels pumping for another couple of miles. And then with the brakes not working, maybe four or five miles to come to a stop. Listen, let me see that. I want you to check your GPS. -You see where you are? -Yeah, we're going south-southeast, a 192 degrees. Looks like maybe seven, eight miles to a hairpin turn, where it heads back north. Yeah, well, that curve is called Granite Peak. You're on an incline up to the top of that peak. That's going to help us momentum-wise. If the train loses enough speed, it's not going to be able to make the turn and it's going to stop. But if it makes the turn, it's going to be like being on the top of a roller coaster. It's going to gain enough speed going downhill, and it's not going to be able to stay on the tracks. It's going to fly. Two hundred passengers back there. You're telling me this train is going to leave the tracks? Not if it stops. But what if it doesn't, George? George, we're not at 35,000 feet. We're on the ground. There's got to be a way to evacuate these passengers back there. Wait a second. Wait a second. Those cars, they're not broken, it's the engine. Right? Why can't we uncouple them? Don't they have an independent braking system? Yeah, well, we thought about that, but there's a problem. -Don't tell me. Momentum. -Yeah, and weight. It can't be done unless the train is traveling on level ground. Otherwise all the weight is pulling back on the first coupler, -or pushing forward on the first coupler. -Look, this turn before Granite Peak, it puts them on level ground for about a mile. But depending on his speed, he's only got about 45 seconds to a minute to pull the front coupler. That's it. -You hear that, Lucky? -I hear. So how much time do I have? Five minutes. It's all yours, Lucky. You're in charge. You're the man. Make it happen. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Lucky Singer. I've been authorized by the Americana Rail Control Center to inform you that we plan to uncouple the passenger cars from the engine. Please don't be alarmed. Each passenger car is equipped with an independent braking system. Now when we separate, you'll hear a loud popping sound. -That's the pneumatic hoses separating. -Scott, good luck. -Please stay calm and in your seats. -Thanks. Brace yourself the best you can. The cars will be stopping quickly. So be prepared. C'mon, slow down, baby. Slow down. Kevin! Kevin! Stay back here! The crest is only a mile away! -I don't think she's going to slow down in time. -We still have two minutes. I don't think she's going to stop in time! Scott, you're going to have to help me uncouple the cars. -I'm ready when you are. -Let's do it. Get these doors. We're on the flat! It's not stopping! We've got less than a minute! -You see those handles there? -Yeah. They've gotta come up and out, simultaneously, and these knuckles have gotta open! But hang on. There's going to be a hell of a jolt when the brakes kick in. -All right. Let's go. -Got it. -Lucky, be careful. -Don't...don't say it. Hey, Kev, it's going to be ok. -Okay? -Yeah. On the count of three! One, two, three! (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNT) (GRUNTS) -Let's try it again. -All right. One, two, three! (BOTH GRUNT) (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNT) -It's jammed! -(GRUNTS) -It's no good! Try again! -Yeah. -One, two, three! -(BOTH GRUNT) (BOTH GRUNT) (BOTH GRUNT) (LUCKY SHRIEKS) -Dad! -Lucky! He fell off! You've got to stop it! You've got to stop the train! Mrs. Singer, we can't stop the train! -Ah! -Now, we've got to call someone to help your husband. Mrs. Singer, they'll be able to find him and they'll be able to get him. But we'll have to call someone and them know where he is. All right. You're right! You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Kevin, come with me. -No! I hate you! It's all your fault! -You made us do this! -Stop it! -You made us get on this train! -Stop it, calm down! Stop it! Stop it and calm down! Listen to me! You have to trust me. I love him as much as you do. Now you're going to come with me and we're going to call for help for your dad. All right? This is where you have to be strong, Kevin. We both do. (GRUNTS) Ahhh! This is Connie Singer. Who's on? Connie, this is George. We saw the GPS, the train's still moving. What the hell's going on? It didn't uncouple, the cars are still attached to the engine. Do you hear me? It didn't work. Lucky fell off the train. What? (DIALING) The subscriber you are trying to reach, -has traveled... -The subscriber has traveled outside. please try again later. George, I've got his exact position. You've got to send in a rescue chopper right now. Look...look, Connie, I can't do that. I mean, it's mountains. It's forest stuff there. Search and rescue's just going to have to go in on foot. No, that's not good enough. He may be severely injured, George. -That's not an option. -Look, Connie, there's nothing I can do. I don't want to be cold about this, but I've got 200 people on that train and unless I figure out a way to stop it. Wait a minute. Patch me through to Frank O'Hearn. Lieutenant Colonel Frank O'Hearn. Connie, I know he's Lucky's best friend, but really. Patch me through, George! Fitch, patch her through. -O'Hearn. Lieutenant Colonel Frank O'Hearn. -Mr. Bouchard. You tell him it's an emergency. -You tell him I'm going to wait on the line. -Mr. Bouchard, you better take a look at the monitor. I'm not going to like this, am I? If the calculations are right, accelerating at this rate without brakes, this train's going to be like a rocket when it hits the S-curve. The tracks aren't going to be able to support that speed, right? Theoretically, no. But that's not even the major problem. I mean, let's say, by some miracle, it even makes it through the first part of the S-curve, with all the momentum it's building, it's going to slingshot into the second part of the S -and fly off the tracks right here. -What's that building? That, sir, is the problem. That structure is Mercy View Hospital. The second largest hospital in the county. -How long? -42 minutes. -Sir? -Hello? -Hello? -Frank? Hey, George, you caught me doing a little freelance. Heard you got grounded and you're playing with choo-choos now, huh? Uh, yeah, well, not exactly. Frank. Uh, listen, I'm going to patch you through to Connie Singer. Connie, I've got Frank on the other line. Frank? Oh, thank God they found you. Hey, Connie. How ya doin'? -Lucky's in trouble. -Yeah, well, what else is new? No, I mean trouble, Frank. We're on an Americana Rail train. We're... we're a runaway. Lucky was trying to uncouple the passenger cars, he fell off. We're, uh, we're in the mountains. A 170 miles south of Seattle. And Frank, we've got a Congressional delegation on board, including Senator -Grundfest. -I'll be in the air in 45 seconds. I'll radio you for his position. Frank O'Hearn's sending for help for your dad. -He'll find him. He'll pick him up. -What if they don't? -What if they can't? -Kev, we've gotta keep our hopes up. -Yeah, I've heard that before. -He'll find him. He'll find him. Scott, you're here. I've been looking for you. I need your help back there. You don't need my help. -What are you talking about? -I took too long. We were supposed to pull the handles at the same time. -Maybe I could have... -It's not your fault. It was an accident. -What else could you have done? -Something more. -I guess I never come through when it really counts. -Listen to me. This isn't about some stupid game or dropping a ball on television. This is about 200 people who need our help. So you can stay here and feel sorry for yourself or you can come with me. (PANTS) (PANTS) (BLEEPING) George, we've just cleared the first turn, starting to head down. I can already feel we're picking up some speed. - Any word from Frank? -O'HEARN: Connie, we're about four minutes away from his position. You just hang on. O'HEARN: I'll let you know as soon as we've got him. (PANTS) (LUCKY PANTS) Oh, this is going to hurt. (GRUNTS) Ah! Ah. (GRUNTS) Options, George, we need viable options. GEORGE: We're working on it, Connie. We are working on it. All right, Connie, we're over the tracks now and we're about 20 seconds away from his position. I'll let you know as soon as we sight him. (PANTS) -This train going to San Francisco? -Dad! -So good to see you guys! -Oh! -Are you okay? -I'm okay. I feel like I fell off a train. -Where do you hurt? -Oh, where don't I hurt? I was so worried, I couldn't think straight. All I was thinking is that I'd never get a chance to tell you about the baby. -Baby? -Our baby. There was so much going on at home, -that I never found the right time to... -Baby? Oh, honey. Oh, God! A baby? You hear that, Kev? You're going to have a brother and a sister, maybe, huh? -That's cool. -Yeah, that's cool. It's cool. (BOTH LAUGH) O'HEARN: Connie, are you sure about that position? I mean, we've got no sign of him here! -Is that Frank? -Yeah. Connie? Are you there? She's busy right now. O'HEARN: Lucky? Is that you? What the hell are you doing? God, Lucky, how the hell'd you get back on the train? You can't get rid of me that easily. I decided to hop back on. (LAUGHS) Meanwhile, this train is going faster by the second. How do we stop it? Oh, listen, we're working on it. George? I'm goin to take you off line for a second, Lucky. We're in contact with emergency services in Farmington. They are starting evacuation of the Mercy View Hospital. We're talking about a thousand people, George. There's no way on earth to get them on safe ground in the next half an hour. What are we overlooking? I mean, there's got to be a way to stop this train. Derail it. (WHISPERS) There are 200 people on that train! There are a thousand in the hospital. There's got to be another way. Even if you wanted to, there's not enough time to get a crew in there for a controlled derailment. At this speed, there's no such thing as a controlled derailment. But there's a switcher, right here in Farmington. We could steer them off the main track and into this quarry. Do you realize what you're saying? Do you have any idea what's going to happen when those cars hit the rocks? You're asking me to choose between a thousand people and 200 people. I've got friends on that train. You don't have a choice, George. Get a man to the switcher. -Have him standing by. -How do you want to prepare the people on the train? You are going to tell them, aren't you? POLICEMAN: All right, get over there. -Keep those pests right where they are. -(SIREN WAILS) REPORTER: And authorities at the NTSB have, in fact, confirmed that the Americana Railway Grande Royale luxury train is officially a runaway. If the NTSB's predictions and calculations are right, that train is expected to jump the tracks here in Farmington, not more than a hundred yards -from where I'm standing right now. -(SIREN WAILING) As you can see behind me, there is a full scale evacuation of Mercy View Hospital in progress, in hopes of getting everyone out before the Grand Royale enters the S-curve, where it is certain to derail. Hospital officials are declining comment when asked, if, in fact, they will be able to evacuate in time. However, local authorities have told this reporter that that is very unlikely. And that they are planning for the worst. -Turn it off. I don't want to hear it anymore. -Live for Channel... ADMINISTRATOR: You don't understand, in addition to all my non-ambulatory, I've got a half dozen critical in post-op. Now three of them are on ventilators. We're in the middle of two major operations. I've got two women minutes away from delivering. Now there is no way I can have even half this place evacuated in half an hour. Look, I'm in constant contact with the railroad. They're going to try and stop it at Farmington. But until I know it's stopped, we're getting everybody, and I mean everybody, out of here. -(GASPS) -Ben? Oh, Ben. Ben, I'm here, honey. -Honey, want me to take it off? -(GASPS) Mr. Hofflund, how you doing? -SCOTT: This is definitely a good sign. -MRS. HOFFLUND: It's great. Scott, Scott, he's back on the train. -What are you talking about? -Mr. Singer, he's back on the train. How? I don't know how, but he's in communication with the control center right now. -That's great. (LAUGHS) -Yeah. I've got the one critical that needs to be airlifted immediately. O'HEARN: That I cannot do, pal. I'm not equipped. Hey, Bouchard, send in the Mercy View medivac! Tell them we'll transport there. Uh, no. That's not going to work. Why not? It's the closest facility. GEORGE: We've asked for a precautionary evacuation of Mercy View. Why? Why are you evacuating? It's just precautionary. George, what aren't you telling me? Bouchard, lay it out. All right, Lucky, here it is. Unless we stop you, there's no question that the train is leaving the tracks. -What? -It's going to go airborne on the second loop of the S-curve, next to the hospital. What do you mean, when you... when you stop us? How are you going to stop us? The only way we can. We're going to have to derail you. What? Where? When? At Farmington. We've got a switcher there. George, do you realize what you're saying? You've got 200 passengers back there! You can't do that! Yeah, and I've got a thousand in the hospital. I mean, what's my choice here, Lucky? Give me a better choice and I'll take it. CONNIE: I'm guessing 25 minutes. LUCKY: 25 minutes? Frank? Frank, you there? You've got 25 minutes to evacuate everyone off this train. O'HEARN: That's not possible, pal. After your critical, you've got time for maybe a dozen more on. Tops. Then we've got to figure out a way to separate the passenger cars from the engine. GEORGE: Lucky, that's not going to work. You're going downhill. Even if you were able to uncouple, the car's brakes are not going to hold. The cars are just going to follow you downhill. 25 years, George, I've been driving the big bus. I've not lost a passenger, not one. I don't plan to start now. And those people back there are my passengers now. Do you hear me? But, Frank, how much weight will a CH54 handle? About 60 tons, Lucky. But... -that's not going to. .. -Look, it's all we've got. I want you to get a CH54 Sky Crane here as soon as you can. And bring me some SP-20. Will you do that? Enough to blow up the engine coupler. It's not going to work, Lucky. You're going downhill. George, unless you've got some other idea, it's a plan, okay? Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. But if we don't try it, we're gonna have triple figure casualties. And that's not going to happen on my watch, do you hear me? Yeah. I hear you. All right. Frank, send me some extra SP-20. A lot extra. Lucky, I don't know what you're planning, but it sounds crazy to me. Yeah, crazy. Time to try something crazy. It's all right. It'll be all right. CH54 PILOT: Lieutenant Colonel O'Hearn, we're in position. I'm ready to lower the package. Over. O'HEARN: Okay, Lucky, he's ready to lower the SP20 explosives and the detonators. Copy that. We're ready. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? I'd like everybody to move to the forward cabin. Thank you, right now. Calmly. Stay calm. Everything's under control. Thank you very much. Okay, Scott. It's in your hands. -Yeah, that's what's worrying me. -It's okay. You can do it. (SHRIEKS) (GRUNTS) Lower! Lower! Whoa! (GRUNTS) Yeah! (PANTS) -(PANTS) -Good job. -You okay? -Yeah, better than okay. -All right. -Let's do this. Let's go. Kevin, stay here with April and Scott. No! No, I want to go! Kevin, please, listen to me. -I need you to stay here, okay? -No! What... what if something happens? I want to go! -It's okay. -Nothing's going to happen. I promise you. Just stay here and do what April tells you. (GRUNTS) -What's happening, you have to tell us. -Please, Miss you've got to sit down, please. Charlie, listen to me. You've gotta get these people seated. Now when I blow the coupler, the air brakes on the cars are going to come on. Now we'll try to get the cable from the helicopter attached to the rear coupler. We're going to try to keep these cars from chasing the engine down the hill. I'll do everything I can. Mr. Singer, good luck. -CONNIE: Frank? Yeah... -All right, everybody, everybody, please move to the front of the car -right away. -LUCKY: Frank, I've got the package. I'm heading to the engine right now. Well, you'd better hurry up, buddy. You're running out of time. He's not going to make it. There's not enough time. -You have to derail it. -I know. I know. -I'm Senator Grundfest, and I demand... -I know who you are, Senator. But I can't talk to you right now. So if you'll excuse me. I'm afraid that that just won't do. Our delegation is set to be air-lifted off this train right now! -I can't do that, Senator. Now excuse me. -You just listen to me. There is a military helicopter out there and we are government officials. So don't you tell me you can't do it! Senator, you're scaring these people. And I know you don't want to do that. Now I'm going to just tell you one more time to sit down and shut up. Or I will throw your bureaucratic ass right off this train. It will not be a pretty sight, do you understand me? Oh, yes, yes. Of course I do. -I mean, we should all work together on this. -Yes, that's a good idea. Get...get those people away from the windows and into their seats. Now! We'll get right on it. -How much time do we have? -Not enough. CONNIE: We need more time, George. GEORGE: Look, there's no more time, Connie. I can't manufacture it. You're going to be at the switcher in about two minutes. -Get back in the car and brace yourself. -He can do it, George! He's almost got it! O'HEARN: Connie, tell Lucky the cable still isn't fastened. He's having some kind of problem. Please, George, we just need a few more minutes! April, come here, I need a hand! Kevin, no! Hey, you've got to let him go! I need your help! (SCOTT GRUNTS) Ladies and gentlemen, this car is going to come to a sudden stop. If you're sitting down, you won't get hurt. Please. (SCOTT GRUNTS) If everybody's sitting down, you won't get hurt. The explosives are set. Frank, how you coming with that cable? He's got a woman working with him. Hold on. (GRUNTS) Okay! Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Cable is fastened. George, we're set! We're ready! 60 seconds, Lucky. You've run out of time. George, turn the switcher back. George, please, for the love of God, don't kill these people! We've got 200 people on this train! I can save these people, George! Turn it back! 200 people versus a thousand? Two hundred versus, who knows how many, five? Maybe none? Switch the track, George! Captain Singer has done everything he said he would. If you switch it back, those people, at least they have a chance of surviving. Switcher's dead ahead, Lucky. Switch it back. -What? -I said switch it back! This is Fitch. Switch it back. Now! GEORGE: Okay, Lucky, it's done. Thanks, George. I'm setting the detonator. GEORGE: Lucky, you've got to get off of there now. There's nothing more you can do. Just get off. Do you hear me, Lucky? Do you hear me? -What are you doing? What? -You go. I'm staying with the engine. Connie, I've got to try to stop it before it hits the hospital. No. No! No! -I'm staying with you! -No, Connie, go! -You have to stay with Kevin. -Kevin will be fine, Lucky. He'll be fine. -I am not leaving... -Look, listen to me! -I will find a way to get on. -Dad! -Kevin, what are you doing here? -I'm not leaving you! CONNIE: Kevin, we've got to go! KEVIN: I'm staying with you! No! CONNIE: We've got to go! CONNIE: Kevin! -You go with Connie, do you hear me? You go! CONNIE: We've got to go! -I'll be back, I promise! I'll be back! -Dad! No! (SCREECHING) (BLEEPING) (BLEEPING) (GRUNTS) (ALL SHRIEK) -(HISSING) -(SCREECHING) O'HEARN: It's uncoupled! Hang on! (SCREECHING) (ALL SHRIEKING) (SCREECHING) It's not going to hold! (ALL SHRIEKING) (SHRIEKING) (ALL GASP) (ALL CHEER) -We stopped. That's it? -Yeah. Yeah. -Honey, we stopped! -Yeah. -You all right? -(GRUNTS) Yeah. O'HEARN: Bouchard, we got it! Train has stopped on a double-track siding. Looks like everybody's safe and sound! (ALL CHEER) (ALL LAUGH) Are you okay? We stopped and you're going to be just fine. We'll get you to a hospital and they'll look after you. What about Dad? He's going to be all right. I know it. It's not over yet. Without the weight of the cars, the engine's speeding up. It's going to hit the S-curve in exactly two and a half minutes. (SIREN WAILING) FIRE CAPTAIN: Let's get these cars out of here! Get in all back here! Come on, get these cars out of here! Now! Come here. I want you to go down to the front entrance and unblock the traffic, whatever it is. Block up the main road. I don't care. We've gotta get these people out of here! George, there's got to be a way. Something we haven't thought of. We've tried everything. -What's happening at the hospital? -Full evacuation. But there's still hundreds there. The hospital's about three minutes away. (TRAIN HORN BLARING) Frank, LUCKY: can you see the S-curve? It's about a minute and a half away, Lucky. What's at the first loop of the S? It's a gorge. It's about 250 feet deep. Is there any chance we could go off there instead of at the hospital? REDDICK: No. You don't have enough speed. You're going off at the second loop, near the hospital. Right, our old friend, centrifugal force. I was just talking to Kevin about it yesterday. He took my old soapbox racer and... (SCREECHING) -Lucky? -George, -have we been thinking about this backwards? -What do you mean? Is there any chance, instead of slowing the train down, what if we sped up? Well, you're in a free fall, Lucky, how are you going to gain speed? We turn the diesels back on. Pump some juice into the traction motors. That might work. But he's going to need about twelve more miles per hour to...to jump the tracks at the first loop. GEORGE: Lucky, go ahead and try it. But what about you? (GASPS) George, what's your reading? GEORGE: I see some acceleration. Not enough. He's never going to make it. He'll make it. He has to. FITCH: Come on. Come on, Lucky. -LUCKY: How much time until the first curve? -72 seconds! Okay, I'm going to blow up the engine. I'm not taking a chance that I don't make that turn and hit the hospital. GEORGE: Lucky, you're picking up speed! Go ahead. Blow the engine and get off the train. Do you hear me? Get off the train. That's my plan, buddy. O'HEARN: Lucky, I'm going over you! LUCKY: Stay there! I'm coming! (BLEEPING) -Reboot this! -(BLEEPING) Lucky, this engine's picking up speed. You gotta get out of there! Come on, Lucky! Come on! (BLEEPING) Come on, Lucky! Grab it! Grab the skid! (GRUNTS) (BLEEPING) Everybody okay here? Any injuries at all? FITCH: Come on! Come on, Lucky, grab it! Grab the skid! (BLEEPING) -Come on, Lucky, move it! You've got about ten seconds to get your butt up here! -(GRUNTS) -Okay, buddy. Hang on, you're going for a ride! (SCREECHING) (BLEEPS) (BLEEPING) O'HEARN: Okay, Bouchard, I got Lucky off. He's hanging onto the skid. But your locomotive, it's swimming with the fishes. -All right! -(ALL CHEER) Call Mercy View. Tell them they're safe. All's clear. -All right! -(GEORGE LAUGHS) -Why, they don't call him Lucky for nothing, huh? -(ALL CHEER) SANDY: Right this way. Keep moving forward. I'm going to have a full investigation of this. Armond Grundfest, nice to see you. I'm going to find out exactly what put these people... (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) -Thanks, buddy! All right. -Any time! It's okay. -It's okay. -Oh. It's okay. It's all right. (LUCKY LAUGHS) -You okay? -Yeah. (LAUGHS) Hey, Kev, how many brothers and sisters do you want to have? As many as you and Mom will have. Thanks, Kevin. Coming from you, that means a lot. Okay, guys, let's get the medical team together. I'll come up. Get 'em in. So, what do you say we, uh, walk home from here, huh? CONNIE: Sounds so good to me. (LAUGHS)
