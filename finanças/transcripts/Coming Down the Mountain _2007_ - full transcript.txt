Last summer, I decided to kill my brother. If I was thinking straight I'd have planned to kill him in a sensible way, like where no one finds out, dumping him at sea, burying him in a forest, that kind of thing. But I guess when you decide to kill someone, you're not thinking straight. What the hell are we doing here? We're just a load of mixed up chemicals, change the recipe, and we'd be really big potatoes with eye tentacles. Or we wouldn't be here at all. Of course, sometimes they do change the recipe and you get a brother who really is a big potato with eye tentacles. And then you might as well talk to the dog, if you have one, which we don't. You ate all the bloody Weetabix. Less of that language, if you don't mind. Well, he is eating all the bloody Weetabix. But I like Weetabix. Look, I had to deal with three pub fights last night, I could do without having another one in me own kitchen. Ben, that was a bit selfish. A bit selfish? He's got eight of them. We'll just have some Alpen. I don't like Alpen. No. David. Can you just grow up please? Go on go, I'll sort everything out. Okay, I'll call you at lunch, let you know what we need from Sainsbury's, okay? Sure. Bye, mum. Bye, Love. How did they kill pigs? They put these headphones on and they think they're going to listen to the Flaming Lips. But then, wham! 10 thousand volts, straight through their head. 15 seconds later they're in a sausage roll. Did I do something really bad in a past life? I'm going to be a vegetarian. Okay, we need both of you on the bus by half past. And this time I don't want any nonsense about can't find your bags or anything. I need a poo. Go and keep an eye on him, will you? I don't want him making a mess like yesterday. Why me? Because he's your brother, because I was at work all last night, and because I would like to finish my breakfast before it goes cold. Normal kids, they're like houseplants or cats, You feed them and change the litter tray, and they're fine. Kids like Ben, you have to read them books all the time, and buy them educational toys. You go to the same bloody chalet in Devon every year, because they like the climbing frame and the ice cream place. And they need someone with them all the time to stop sickos dragging them off to their sex dungeons. The lead from the roof on Saint Paul's Cathedral melted and ran through the streets. The pool of smoke stretched for 50, David Phillips, are you listen to a word I'm saying? Great Fire of London, September 1666. Started in Pudding Lane, house belonged to the King's Baker. Ahhh, one, nil, one, nil, one, nil. Okay, Gary Jeavons. In 12 years time you're going to be stacking shelves in some godforsaken branch of Asda. Suddenly it's going to dawn on you what the point of all this was. Okay, okay, enough. So, you heard about this part at Connor's, yeah? When's this? Tonight, his dad's in Cardiff for the weekend. You gonna come, or are you babysitting again? Maybe, it's just complicated. It's going to be brilliant. His brother's bringing some of that skunk over. Apparently if you smoke a whole joint you can't feel your legs. And then you just, like, vomit everywhere. Okay, I'll come. I want to go. Matthews got a can of petrol. We're heading over to Connor's now. Nah, I've got to take Ben back, I'll catch up later, yeah. Oh, come on, don't want to pitch up on my own. Ben, look, don't tell mum and dad, Yeah. You made me do this before, and I got into trouble. No, I got into got into trouble. Anyway mum and dad won't find out. Tell them, I took you home, then went back to Connor's place, yeah. Keep the change, and buy yourself some chocolate at the shop. I've spent my entire life sharing a room with Ben. 16 years, and I don't think the two of us had ever been more than half a mile apart. I had to get some space. It was just like every other party. I stand around in Connor's living room watching everyone from school doing their mating rituals. Waiting for Rob to take the piss. Gail Hardcastle fancies you. Yeah, right? I know, baffling, but there you go. Women are a mystery. You're not serious? Megan overheard Gail talk about us the other day. And I overheard two teachers talking and apparently Mr Minton has a tail, which is why he always wears those baggy trousers. You really are quite odd, aren't you? Scouts honor. You're winding me up. When have I ever lied to you? When you peed in that bottle and told me it was home brew. It's you're call. I might be stupid, but I'm not that stupid. Hey, get some of that down your neck, mate. No thanks. You're a bloody girl. Is it true. David got a good sense of humor. Plus, she really liked that sculpture we did for Remembrance Day. The one of the dead bodies. Don't want a shag, do you? No. Oh well, no harm in asking. It's easy for Rob, because the doctors took his brain at birth and replaced it with the brain of a small and very excitable dog. Which is great for him. Though it does mean he talks bollocks most of the time. Old skinny gonk was having a clear out. Sort of lucky dip remains you see. Said this might appeal to our sense of adventure. So these are? I have no idea. 12 Monkeys, it works in 12 Monkeys. No, it doesn't. because all the clue that show everyone how to go back in time to stop the plague are put there by Bruce Willis, after he goes back in time. Yeah, but that's the whole point. I mean, you go back in time, you're going to end up changing something, right? No, doesn't work like that. Why not? Because if you could change our past, someone from the future could change the present. So we'd have to wait till the end of time to find out what we're meant to be doing now. Unless every time someone change our past, the universe splits into two and there's millions of different- Ay, ay, bandits at 12 o'clock. I was telling the truth. You do you realize that, don't you? I mean before you throw away the chance to get your grubby hands on most amazing arse in North London. Okay, say you're right, for the sake of argument. It wouldn't work. It never works because our house smells of wee, or because I'd get them pregnant with little disabled babies or, don't know why. It was bad enough when Mandy Fulcher chucked me, and she had a mustache. So you're just gonna give up, spend the rest of your life living in a bedsit, eating pot noodles and masturbating over weird porn. Could be worse. You are a strange, sad, little man. Leah persuades Patrick's little brother to pork a tampon. This I have to see. Gail Hardcastle. God, even girls fancied her. I reckon she was beamed down from another planet to torture the rest of us. A couple of years and she'd be gone. Work as a model. Marry someone with a yacht. But me, I was stuck in real life, and trying not to think about it. Video games, 12 cans of lager, get far enough out of it, and you can pretend you're not even here. David, David? Yeah! David, Yeah! David, hello. Er, sorry. Er, you know, miles away. If this is a bad time. What's going on? I mean, if this is some stupid joke you and Rob have cooked up What are you talking about? Oh shit. So it's not, like, a piss take, or anything. Why would it be a piss take? Well, Rob said that you, that you liked me. God, this is sounding really stupid. So you assume that I couldn't fancy you because? Guess my brother mostly. Everyone gets the piss taken out of them for some reason or other. Debbie Taylor. Birth mark. Daniel Spicer. Weird smell. Vicki Daily. One breast bigger than the other. Really? Yeah , I mean, not that I've looked at them much. Little and large, that's what they're called. By blokes, I mean, not her. She probably hasn't given them names. You're funny. And that's a good thing. Don't make a big song and dance about it. Except you. Except me what? Well, everyone gets the piss taken out for some reason or other, except you. When people take the piss out of you, it's just jealousy. Really? Yeah. This is the bit where you kiss me. Sorry, mate. What? There's someone looking for you. Tell them to go away. I don't think I can do that. We ask you to do one thing, David. I took him home, then I came over here. Don't lie to me David, Mrs Kahn saw him on the bus. He missed his stop. But then I got off at the next one, and then I remembered the way back home. Okay, okay, okay. I get the picture. You're coming home right now with me, young man. Entertainment's over people. In. Then I remember. I have been away from Ben, school trip, North Wales. No Ben, no mum, no dad. The happiest week of my life They do swimming, music, drama. I dropped into flog it and run on the way home. The contracts are going out tomorrow. So we can drive up on Wednesday then. God, four hours on our own in the car. We haven't done that for 17 years. Well don't get to excited about it. Play you're cards right, I'll get you egg and chips at Hemel Hempstead. David, it'll be Rob. Perhaps we should mention it. David. Oh, for gods' sake. The real world's going to come as a horrible shock to you, isn't it? It's Rob. I just don't want him to to build his hopes up, and then have the carpet pulled from under his feet. We picked up this guy today, who'd accidentally stapled his hand to his desk. You all right, mate? That's disgusting. Where we going? to see Gail. Hang on. Actually, you're going to see Gail. I'm just going to make sure you get there. No way. I made a complete dick out myself the other night. There's no way I'm going. She'll understand. Why you even doing this? Because Abby asked me to, and because I fancy her, and we had a snog at the party. And she said, if I was a real friend, I'd make you go see Gail. So, I'm kind of doing her a favor. This is stupid. Please. Go on then. If she sees you standing on the steps for 10 minutes she really is gonna think you're a weirdo. Okay, okay. Gail, look, you probably think I'm an idiot now. Won't want to be seen dead with me after that night, but I understand, just wanted to know for sure. I know I'm probably making a complete prat of myself turning up like this, but, Yeah, they're kissing, kissing right now. Yes, they're kissing, they're kissing right now. I'm watching them right now, they're kissing. Yes. It was like I'd been drowning, then Gail saved me. For the first time someone really mattered. It wasn't me, it wasn't Ben. And I realized that this was what life was meant to be about. Argh! We slow up as we drive past, and there's flashing lights and broken glass all over the road and there's this woman lying face down. And there's blood pouring out of her head. I want to go with a heart attack or stroke. You know something quick, no warning. I want something that eats away at you. Loads of flowers, diamorphine.

What the hell do you think you're doing? We're moving too Matlock. I'm having a crap, if you don't mind, would you mean, we're moving to Matlock? I'm gonna go to a special school. And we're going to live in a really big house with a really big garden. Are you telling the truth, or have you gone completely mad? Mum and dad said that I should have friends. Christ! Get out! Get out! Fuck, this is insane. What about me? What about Gail? What about my friends? David. We've all got to make a few sacrifices. you, me, your father. Fuck. If I hear any more of that language, you're going straight to your room. Hi love. I'm hungry. Can you make Ben a sandwich, please David. What? Go on, there's some cheese and tomatoes in the fridge. I'm sure even Ben can make a sandwich for himself. The knife's sharp, and I don't want crumbs all over the kitchen floor. Will you just do it? Christ? You want him to go to a proper school so he can learn stuff, and you won't even let him use the bread knife. That should keep you going to lunch time. David. Can I eat this? Yeah, yeah. What's up, big boy? I'm moving, to Matlock. It's in Derbyshire. When? A couple of weeks. Well, we'd better make the most of the time we have left then, hadn't we? I could come down on the train, you could come up and visit. Over here you. Pretend you're a girl. Matlock? It's in Derbyshire. Jesus. There's some school there's going to turn Ben into a genius. But Derbyshire is, like a hundred miles away. What about Gail? 200 miles. Can I have some more money? I dropped my money, and it went down the drain. I need money for the bus. Why are you so stupid, Ben? Why are you so clumsy, and stupid, and pathetic? I'm not stupid. Well, why do I have to look after you, all the fucking time then, hey? Why do I spend my life cleaning up your mess? Why don't you take some fucking responsibility for a change? David, what the hell are you doing? You're not my brother, you're not my brother! I get this dream every night. There's a bomb about to go off. I'm shouting but no one can hear me. I shout, mum, dad. They just look straight through me. Then Ben turns to me. And I know he's the only person who can see me. And I say, help me. But he just smiles his big, stupid smile and turns and walks away. And I wake up, and I'm sweating and I think, it's okay, it's just a dream. Except it isn't, is it? It's my life. Then I was drowning again. It's a Red Cross parcel, like in Colditz. there's 10 postcards with stamps on. And there's some of that skunk from Kevin. But we put it in a quality street wrapper, so don't let any one eat it, okay. And there's a copy of Penthouse. Abby wasn't so keen, but I said it was, like, compassionate grounds. And there's that book I was telling you about, The Darkest Star, which is just awesome. And a DVD of 12 Monkeys, so you can see you were talking bollocks. Look after yourself, Rob. Come on shift you're arse, or you're gonna be left behind. Congratulations to both of you, from your mom, Eileen, and of course you're dad, Terry. Kevin, this one's for you. The Wonderful World of the Young? A hit for Danny Williams in the same year. What are the people in Matlock going to be like? They've got webbed feet and they all talk Maltese. Do they eat maltesers? No, they mostly eat parsnips. I hope we don't have to eat parsnips. Except on Sundays, when they bake a child in a pie. David. I thought it was funny. Okay, then, we'll just eat the fingers, with chutney. David, that is horrible. Hi, yeah, Gail, it's, David. We're there, Matlock. Turn left at the Gobi Desert. I miss you. Give me a call, okay. Are you gonna give us on with this lot, or what? Right, you're in pairs. One of you is going to be Rosencrantz, the other Guildenstern, I want you to write a conversation that they might have in the court, on the ship. Just imagine what they might be talking about. Everyone understand? You've got 15 minutes. What is that? You, me, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Pretty much everyone eventually. Okay, it's just I left a couple of messages on her mobile. And well, I know she lost the last two. So if you could, Yeah, thanks. This is David. My name's Henry. Henry's in my class, and he's going to be my special friend. And he's going to look after me. What's your favorite football team? Not really my thing, football. Fair enough. Henry's got a girlfriend. She's called Natasha. Why are you drawing dead monkeys all over the postcard? David can be a bit strange sometimes. Okay. Come on. Let's go and see mum. What the fuck is that? It's a nipple ring. You're queer, aren't you? The new kid's a queer. Why hasn't he got an erection then? Because you're all so ugly. I'm watching you. But I did speak to the woman who runs Little Ted's in town and they've got a vacancy coming up next month. So I'm going to go over on Wednesday, for a look round. Ah, told you it'd work out. Actually, I think it was me who told you it was gonna work out Can I go round to Henry's on Saturday? Fine by me. Well, you give me Henry's phone number and I'll have a little word with his mum, okay? All right. You made any new friends yet? No. Well, you've got to make an effort you know, you can't just sit on your backside waiting for people to come to you. Thanks for the advice. Tell you what, let's all get our boots out of the weekend and take a hike up the big hill. Have a look around that folly. What's a folly? It looks like a real building. But when you go close, you realize it's completely empty. David. I'm not hungry. Okay I'm worried about David. No one's happy as his age, were you? You're staring at me. Just so long as you're happy. That's the important thing isn't it, hey? He stood on a slope of shame, at the edge of the crater and looked up through a trillion miles of nothing. to constellations he only barely recognized. Behind him, the wreckage of the cruiser lay like an origami swan that someone has stamped on. He had survived the worst crash in company history, and now he was going to die, slowly and on his own. The nearest human being was two parsecs away. He had to do something, but what? Lie down, scream? It wouldn't change anything. A tiny red light began to flash in his forearm. The acid in the planets atmosphere was beginning to eat away at the seal around his helmet. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. That's okay. Look, why don't you come up here sometime. Or I could come down there. Actually, that's a much better idea. Seeing as there's nothing to do here. If your parents aren't getting me staying over I can always borrow bed from Rob. Why not? Gail, what's the matter? Jesus, Gail. It's only been what, five weeks? Who is it? Yeah, well maybe it matters to me. From the tattoo place? I'm still here. You okay, mate? Yeah. You seem a bit wired. I'm going to head round to Gail's place. Are you sure that's a good idea. Mate. It's okay. I just got, um, I need to talk to her. Listen. Yeah. It's a bit crap but I was wondering if I could kip on your sofa tonight. I'll keep out you're way and everything. Sure. Cheers. Ouch. Gail, can I talk to you? I want to talk to you for five seconds. Please, Gail, please. Fuck off. Come here please. Let me talk to you for one second. What the hell did you think you were doing? We could be friends at least. I mean, you're the only person I've really ever been able to talk to. You know, like really talk. Friends ring to say they want to see you. Friends don't track you down. And scare the crap out of you by turning up out the blue, like a psycho, and punching your boyfriend. I'm sorry.

You don't tell us where you're going. I went to London, I told you. David, if you're having problems, you should tell us. You have absolutely no idea, do you? Look. Did you have a fight at school. Come on, let's get you in kitchen, hey? We'll clean up those cuts. That was your headmaster on the phone. Yes, not now. What is wrong with you, David? We've moved house, everyone does it. God Almighty, if Ben can manage to fit in, I don't know why you can't. Yeah, well, I could fit in on the surface of Mars, if I had an IQ of seven. You hit David. Don't you ever talk about your brother like that again. Let's go somewhere else, hey? No, leave him alone. Oh David. Jesus, well, I mean, this is all about him, isn't it? Look, it's not about Ben, and you know, it. Everything's about Ben. Everything's always about Ben. Ben's the reason we moved here. Ben's the reason I'm not with Gail anymore. Ben's the reason I haven't got any friends. Everything we ever do is so Ben can have a fucking easy life. That is enough. Ben wants a bigger bedroom. Ben wants to go Devon for a holiday. Ben wants a model railway Ben wants a Ferrari, a fucking Swedish masseur. I'm sick of bloody thinking about Ben. David, come back. David. Open this door. David, open the door. Open this door. David, I'm not going to tell you again, open the door. Now, come on. David. Open this door. Then it dawns on me. I'm hurting the wrong person. Rise and shine. Now, you listen to me. After last night's performance, I'm not sure I can trust you to do anything. But your mum's on her way to this job interview and I'm leaving for work in 10 minutes. So, you have to make sure that Ben is dressed and ready and outside in time for his school bus. Okay? I said, Okay. Good. You're looking at me again. I don't like you looking at me. Pack a bag. What? Pack a bag. I'm meant to be going to school. Do mum and dad know we're going somewhere? Shut up and keep walking. What are we doing now? So what are you two up to then? We're going camping, I think. Oh, I used to love camping, me. Baked bean, rain on the canvas, soggy boots in the morning. Not done it for years. Wife likes her creature comforts too much. She'd take the bloody hoover if she could. Can I have this as well? No. But I want them and we're on holiday, and when I'm on holiday, I'm allowed to have what I want. Can I have this as well? I'm going to count to five. And if you don't put that back where you got it from I'm going to brain you, do you understand? I understand. Come on. David's my brother. We're going camping, in a tent. Well it's getting late. Why don't you come and stay over in my place. I've got a little cottage near Llangollen. I could rustle you up some supper. No Do you like Country and Western? I like Country and Western. Good. It's getting dark. There might be some wild animals. Well maybe if you got off fat arse and help me get this tent up, we could get inside it. I don't know how to put a tent up. Maybe you can ring mum, and she could help put it up, while you sat there and watched. I don't really like to ring mum. How did it happen, Ben? How does what happen? How did you manage to get to this age, without learning to blow your own fucking nose? You're being horrible to me. Grab that bit and lay it out flat on the ground. What the fuck are you doing? Come on, it's quite simple. Did you not hear me, hey? You're pathetic, you're useless. I'll do it shall I? Do you want to watch me do this? It was that simple, could you not do that? Could you not bloody do that yourself? Sitting there with your flapjack. Go on, eat some more, eat some more. You want some more? What are you going to do, come on, just sit there? Hi, I'm Alice. And then you're supposed to tell me your name and we talked for a bit. Or possibly not. David, my name's David. So you're in a family holiday hell too, hey? Not really. What because your family is normal? Or because you're here by yourself? I'm on my own, sort of. Oh, well if you ever want some company? I'm sort of busy, at the moment. Well, if you get un busy. This is the women's toilets by the way. Some kids nicked the signs. I want to go home. You're not going home. I'm cold. You'd better get used to it. And suddenly I feel really calm. I'm thinking about Gail. The birthmark on her shoulder, it's long brown shape in two parts like New Zealand or Japan. But she's a long way away. Like I'm looking down at her from space, and it doesn't matter any longer. You're walking really fast. Are we going up the mountain over there? It's a really big mountain. I need to sit down. Don't. I never use the word kill. I never use the word dead. I'm not thinking about what I'm doing. I don't want to think about what I'm doing. It's nothing to do with me anymore. I want to close my eyes. And turn it off and run away. But I can't close my eyes. Can't turn it off. Can't run away. I have to know what's going to happen. I have to get to that final scene. Look at this. This is really, really high. You can see everything, it's like flying. I feel sick. Everything starts to spin. My legs go weak. And there's this sound, like a 767 taking off inside my head. And I think, What the fuck am I about to do? It was such a stupid idea. What was? Bringing you up here. I'm sorry, Ben, really sorry, didn't know what I was doing. Let's just turn around and go back down. But I'm having fun. Ben, please. We have to get off this mountain right now, okay? I'm serious. I'm frightened. That's really funny. It's not funny. And I'm really happy, and you're depressed. Shut up. And that's why mum and dad love me more than you. And I'm the king of the world. You fucking little... Oh shit. Help! I need some help. Gotta save someone quickly. Come on, get up. Please, come on. And suddenly I realized, I've just fucked everything up. If he's still alive, I'm going to prison. If he's dead, I'm going to spend every day of my life telling lies. Shitting myself that someone's going to find out. You're alive. I was so worried about you. You must be his brother. Yeah, yeah, I am. You tried to kill me. What? You tried to kill me. It was an accident. No it wasn't. Look Ben, I didn't mean for any of this to happen. Yes you did. I'll be back in a minute. Don't go anywhere. What the fuck are you doing. You're going to be in really big trouble. No way, get out, get out of the bed. Get up, come. On. Come on. Hang on a minute you two. Let go of me. I want to go home. Just be quiet, okay. I want to go home. Is he all right. He's fine. I was in hospital, but then he made me leave. Ben. Is he telling the truth? Everything's under control, all right? He made me come to Wales, but I didn't want to come. Shut up. And he made me walk up a mountain. Ben, I'm going to fucking strangle you. Now hold on a minute here. I want to get off. I could have been dead. Ben, look. You hate me, you've always hated me. That's not true. And that's why you tried to kill me. I didn't mean to push you. You're a liar. I'm going to ring the police. And then tell mum and dad. Ben, please. And then they're going to put you in the prison, and then I'll be happy. If you say anything, I'll- Go on then, hit me. I rang the police from the phone box, they're going to get you. I'm really sorry. Sorry about what happened on the mountain. Sorry about what happened back home Sorry about, sorry about everything. I'm not stupid. I know. You tell me what to do, like I'm a dog. You make jokes about me. You hit me. And sometimes, you pretend them I'm not your brother. I hated you. I hate mom, I hate dad. I hated Gail. I hated myself. When we moved house I lost Gail, lost all my friends. I felt so shit. Well, you should have tried and killed yourself, then. Actually, I didn't tell the police. No? 'Cause then they'd take your way. And I didn't want to be left on my own. That doesn't mean I like you We meet again. Who are you? Alice. David and I met in the women's toilets last night, as you do. And you are? I'm Ben, David's brother. Cigarette? Smoking's bad for you. Four years off your life, about the same as worrying too much. So, what you two up to then? David's really depressed, and we moved to Matlock. And now David hasn't got a girlfriend anymore. I think she meant, what we're up to, like, today? He made me come to Wales. And he pushed me off a mountain. Except it was more like an accident. We're not actually psychopaths. Oh, no, it's okay. I live with psychopaths. Yeah, my parents are in the Holy Fellowship church in Northampton. So you're a born again Christian? Oh, no, I'm gonna burn in hell me. Smoking, talk talking to boys. We don't even have a telly. Dad saw two blokes getting married on channel four and put it in a skip Basically, my life's crap till I'm 18. Then I'm off. Go to college, join a circus, marry a Canadian. What about you? I want to work in a farm, and milk cows. And you? David wants to be an artist. He can draw Darth Vader. He once drew a picture of Mrs Jones, in the nude. You could see her bosoms. God, minister probably got it pinned up in his loo. Um, can I have a cigarette? Sure. ♪ Summer at last ♪ ♪ Oceans still left to cross ♪ ♪ Cast away ♪ ♪ On a moment ♪ ♪ A friendly word ♪ ♪ Whispers, but left unheard ♪ ♪ On a shelf ♪ ♪ Out of mind and out of reaching ♪ ♪ Changing me ♪ ♪ Changing you ♪ You want to hook up tomorrow?

Some days there's this black stuff in here and it churns and churns, and gets thicker and blacker. I get sad sometimes. Yeah? But then I eat a bag of crisps and watch Star Wars, then it goes away. Maybe I should try that next time. I like Alice., she's nice. I like her too. Do you fancy her. No. I think you fancy her. Don't be stupid. I fancy someone. Who? She's called Natasha. And we've done kissing. Do I really want to know about this? She used to be Henry's girlfriend. So Henry punched me. But now Henry's going out with Rachel, and we're friends again. What's sex like? Sorry? I want to do sex with Natasha, and you've done it with Gail. I heard you telling Rob. God you're nosy. Is it nice? Don't know. But you must know, because you've done it. I was lying. Why? Because Rob had sex with Tracy Hall. Mind you, he could have been lying to Pretty sure he's had sex with Abby Freeman though. Do you think I could do sex with Natasha. I think, Jesus. I think sex is not the most important thing. I saw a lady's vagina. Henry showed me these magazines. His dad keeps them in his desk. It is a bit frightening. Probably best not mentioned that to mum.. I love Natasha. And I think she loves me. It's a bit difficult to tell. It is hard to tell. I'm cold. You know Ben, if you're going to work on a farm, you have to toughen up a bit. Do you think I could work in a farm? Yeah, I think you'd be great at it. You would smell really bad. That's okay. Can we do this again? What? Going camping, on our own. I'm not sure what mum and dad will think about that. It's really great doing stuff like this, with you. We should do more stuff together. Yeah But maybe next time skip the fight and near death experience. Yeah. We lost both rucksacks didn't we? Yeah. Ben? David Phillips? Your mum and dad are really worried. Come with me. Could you not image what it's like for us, for you both to disappear, with no idea where you are? One phone call, David. That's all it would have taken. One phone call. Anything could've happened. Yeah, but it didn't. Anything, David. Stop shouting. We've been to hell and back over the last couple of days. Stop shouting. Ben, please. I know it was stupid, and I've said I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You're not listening to a word we're saying. Stop shouting, stop shouting, stop shouting! Ben, just keep out of it, will you. But I like going camping. And you're being horrible. Ben. Listen to him, for Christ sakes. I do not need a lecture from you. Shut up. He can think for himself. He's got a girlfriend. He's what? She's called Natasha, and she is really nice. He wants to work on a farm. I mean, Christ, he's the most normal person in the whole bloody family. She's called Natasha, and I want her to come around for tea. We should go get some clean clothes on. It still scares me when I think about it. Like it's going to happen again. But this time he's going to die. It's like the vertigo. There's a sickie tingle in your knees. And part of your brain wants to jump over the edge. Mum saw the scars on my arm last week. I said I got them on a barbed wire fence. Sometimes I run my fingers over them to remind myself. It's like those photos of you as a kid. The ones with a dorky hairstyle, and the ninja turtle t-shirt. It's you, but it's not you, just this person who used to have your name a long time ago. he's called Goldie, and I ride him every Saturday You should come and ride him. Riding's for girls. Mr Clarkson, he owns the stables, he was in the army. I think he was someone in the Falklands. Riding stables at 10 on Saturday morning then. Can David come? I think you'll have more fun on your own, mate. Okay. Thanks, Mrs Philips, that was very tasty. Thanks mum. Let's go up to my room. Okay. Are you sure you- Come on. Stop worrying. It's okay, I bought them a packet condoms. Oh, dear God. I'm joking. David, you don't joke about things like that. I thought it was quite funny actually. You're both 12 years old, aren't you. I'm going to put my feet up. Looks like it's me and you, kid. What do you want, washing or drying? Hi Ben. Hi. You weren't actually having sex were you? No, we tried but Natasha didn't like it. so we're just going to do other stuff from now on. Probably just as well. My testicles hurt. Well, you'll have to sort that out for yourself I'm afraid, mate. You're drawing. Yeah. And that cow's a bit wonky. Yeah well, I didn't get much practice doing cows in London. Does Alice write back? Yeah. Is she going to be your girlfriend. I think it's probably not a great idea going out with somebody who lives in Northampton Right. Might go out with Julie though. Is that the Julie, who works in the shop? The one with the really big bottom. It's not that big. Does she like you? She talked to me for like 20 minutes the other day so I guess she's not totally repulsed. Have to wait and see, won't we? That cow is still a bit wonky. Ben. Yes. Shut up. Okay, but I still can sit here, can I? Yeah, you can still sit here. If I shut up? Yeah. Good.
