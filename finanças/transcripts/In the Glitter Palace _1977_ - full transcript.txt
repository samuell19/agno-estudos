[chimes] [suspenseful music] [footsteps] [oboe music] WOMAN: Look at me when I'm talking to you. [soft piano music] [muffled voices in background] [BLAST OF DRUM AND HIGH TEMPO MUSIC] WOMAN: Another Norma Addision. I'm boring you aren't I? Poor me a drink will you? Boring you with all these old show business stories. My drink, darling. Boring to you isn't it? But you have to just stand there and pretend to be interested, don't you my dear? Just stand there and listen whether you like it or not. Because it pleases me and what pleases me-- [burst of high tempo music] [sinister music] SGT. RUGGIERIO: Ms. Walker? Yea. SGT. RUGGIERIO: Katherine Charlotte Walker? Yea. Sergeant Ruggiero, Homicide. Is that your car parked in the driveway, the 70 Cougar, license plate KAYCEEW? Casey. That's-- that's my nickname. It's from my initials. What's this all about? MRS. BOWMAN: That's her. That one, third from the left. SGT. RUGGIERIO: You're sure? MRS. BOWMAN: Absolutely. I saw that car with her driving coming out of Norma Addison's driveway about 11 o'clock. Mrs. Bowman, how can you be so sure of the time? I always walk my Yorkie. Her name is Buttercup. I always walk her at 11. Regularity is most important you know. Anyway, she almost ran us both down, she was driving so fast, Her, that one. Thank you Deputy. That will be it. DEPUTY: Step down please. Officer, am I free to go? DEPUTY: Not yet, miss. What am I supposed to do? I'd get a lawyer, honey. Redstone, Shapiro, Mackland, and Taylor. Mr. Redstone? One moment please. You got mail for me? How'd you do, Vince? Hm? Oh, she threw the book at him. Two years in juvie. Vince, Vince. Why do you waste your time on these crummy criminal gigs? Makes me feel like a lawyer. Ah, we got a 5 o'clock meeting on the Turner insurance case. Remember, Vince, we gotta pay the rent so be there. Oh, I'll be there tomorrow. You know me. MR. REDSTONE: Tell them I'm in conference. MR. REDSTONE'S SECRETARY: Yes Mr. Redstone. Hey, how'd it go? VINCE: Two years in juvie. Not bad. She must be in a good mood today. For her Honor, Judge Candace B. Winslow, there are no good days. Merle nailed me in the hall just now. Dead shot. About dissipating company funds profit wise? That's the tune. You boys make too much money anyway. Nate? Is Nate here? Morning, babe. Nate? Yea. MR. REDSTONE: ELLEN: The meeting's starting. Be right there. Do you have a minute, Vince? Sure. Come on. What's up? There's a friend of mine. I just got a call. She needs a lawyer. And I was wondering if you could help her. Sure. Have her here a little after 5. She's in jail. For what? Murder they say. What does she say? She didn't do it. She couldn't. Not her. Well, that's a pretty good place to start. - Then you'll go see her? - You giving me a choice? - No. - Well, there you go. Now, let me see if I have this right. You told the arresting officers that you were not at Norma Addison's house. That's right. VINCE: An eye witness saw you leaving. I mean that's right. That's what I told the police. But I was there. VINCE: Why'd you lie? I don't know. Because I could feel it was something bad. I didn't know anybody saw me. I shouldn't have done it. VINCE: Done what, Casey? Lied to the police. VINCE: Oh. They like you to do that, you know, so the can catch you at it. You used to be one. VINCE: No. Ellen said. Oh. Investigator for the DA's office. Same difference. Ellen's talked a lot about you. Yea, well we go way back. But you're news to me. Tell me about Norma's house last night. Well, I dropped by to see her. Then I left. She was still alive. Why did you go there? To apologize and-- to apologize. To apologize for what? We were at a party. And I threw a drink in her face and-- and called her scum. And I-- VINCE: Yea, go ahead. Wished that she was dead. In front of more witnesses? You see, the murder weapon was a whiskey decanter. The police found prints on it. Some blurred, the rest yours. I didn't kill her. VINCE: Circumstantial stuff. Pretty good though. I've seen them get convictions on less. You think I'm lying again. Well, I would if it'd save my neck. You don't believe me that I didn't do it. I don't have to believe you're innocent. I just have to stop them from proving your guilty. I want you to believe me. Tell me how you and Norma got to be such good buddies. We-- we knew a lot of the same people. And um we get to know each other like that. I-- You certainly do have a way with words. I want to be helpful. But I-- I've never been in this sort of trouble. I don't know what you want. It's OK. I'm not sure what I want either. Let me nose around a little and see what the case against you looks like. Then you're my lawyer? Yea. Ellen says you're very good. Ellen's prejudiced. Oh, if a-- money's a problem, I can have the court appoint me on a public defender basis. Money's not a problem. Good. I'll be in touch. State of California versus Elwood Nixon. [intense music] [phone rings] Hello? DANKO (ON PHONE): Judge Winslow? This is she. DANKO (ON PHONE): I know what you did. What did you say? DANKO (ON PHONE): I said, I know what you did. Who is this? I said, who is this? [ominous music] [knocking] DANKO: Ah, it's an honor, Your Honor. Heh, heh, heh. Won't you come in. Well, you're here right on time. I came here out of curiosity. Uh-uh. You come here 'cause you're scared. Let's not play games, lady. Exactly what did that phone call mean now? Just what you think it meant. I saw you kill her. Would you ah care for something? Can I ah offer you a little something, hot tea? A ginger snap perhaps. She was scum. Blackmailing scum. Me too. Only I'm smarter than she was. And now it's really going to cost you. See you have the money. I got you. That's our new relationship. It's going to last a long time. Know what I mean? I can hardly believe after all these years, I've been popping my Instamatic through keyholes for crummy divorce cases, stuff with Norma. Now look what's happened. I got you. I hit the jackpot. You want money? You'll have to earn it. DANKO (ON PHONE): Nope. You want me to tell? You don't want to tell. You what to sell your silence. And I'm willing to buy. But it has to include additional services. What the hell you talking about? Don't worry. They're services you're well able to provide. You got things a little confused. I am calling the shots. Are you? I am a person of considerable reputation. And you were charged two years ago with illegal wiretapping. The case was dismissed on a technicality. That's right. JUDGE WINSLOW: Criminal assault when you were a strike breaker in the grape country. A-- a picker was crippled, I believe. But that case was dropped. Yes, the company paid the man off. It was settled out of court. Because the man nearly died. Yea, it cost me 5 grand. Look, Madam Judge, you want me to alert the cops and tell'em I saw you kill her. Is that what you want? And then you could also confess to being a blackmailer. Are you willing to risk that? Are you? Lady, I'm going to get something out of this. Of course you are. And I'm going to reward you. It may not be as extravagantly as you're grubby little dreams would have it. But I will make your very comfortable, if you do what I tell you to. You know ah-- we blackmailed a lot of, people Norma and me. But you killed her. How come? She angered me. I'd say. I didn't know I had that kind of temper but obviously I do. [drum beats] [music playing] VINCE: Raymond Dawson Travers. He's holding interest in television stations, paper mills. I probably missed a lot. I'll be paying your fee. VINCE: For what? Defending my daughter, you're client. Casey. Walker? Her mother's maiden name at birth. Now then, I'd like you to negotiate the best possible deal for us. Plea bargaining. Exactly. An unfortunate accident. A young girl has a momentary lapse of temper. It should be easy to have it reduced to ah some minor manslaughter charge or other. I have a certain amount of influence in this city if you need it. Do the best you can. And then report back to me. Pay the $2. Pardon? - VINCE: It's and old expression. It means ah-- treat it like a traffic ticket. Pay the fine, walk away. We do understand each other. With careful handling on your part and mine, we can avoid a trial. And ah-- Casey should never have to serve one day of her sentence. It's a good plan except she wants to plead not guilty. Of course she does. It's up to you to persuade her otherwise. She says she's innocent. My daughter lies. I know. She told me. But she is my client. And she has given me certain instructions. And I'm giving you new instructions. Listen, don't bother with the fancy car. I'll get a cab back. I mean, riding around in something like that could spoil a guy. Right Billy? [suspenseful music] [soft music] Hi. How are you? I'm kind of [inaudible] I miss you. ELLEN: I know. The lawyer was here. ELLEN: Did you tell him? Ellen, we-- we can't. We can tell the kid story about the [inaudible]. And once you get started, you're stuck and you can't get loose. ELLEN: Not so. We can. Even [inaudible] what you can do. Sure they do. I mean, it happens all the time. I'm scared, Ellen. ELLEN: Don't be. [inaudible] I don't need to. You interested in doing a deal? Well, everything's worth considering, Skipper. You taught me that when I was [inaudible] for the DA's office. How far you prepared to knock it down? Manslaughter? Maybe. What kind of case you got? Gold. Solid gold. Ruggierio special. Now you remember how he sets them up. VINCE: Why so generous? Listen, I don't want to do you any favors if you're not interested. Just asking. Vince, come on. You got to be kidding. This case happens to be a hot potato for everybody concerned. Because of R.D. Travers? Where you heading, Vince? My client is entering not guilty. No, that's not fair, Vince. Now, we're willing to meet you half way to work something out. But you want it all? Following instructions. Oh, like hell you are. Little rich girl wastes somebody. And you figure you're just going to waltz her right out of the slammer? Thumb your nose at everybody and be a hero, the big daddy. You know Vince, ah-- [locker slams] A guy of came into my office once and said he was going to make me an offer I couldn't refuse. He really said that. He opened a briefcase and started putting money on my desk, 5 grand, 10. Asked me if that was enough. 15, 20. When he got to 25 I arrested him. Because he was getting too close to my price, Vince. What's yours? Or are you just trying to justify that big retainer Travers is laying on you? Cheap shot, Freddie. You're way off base. And I'm not the only one. You plead her innocent and it's murder one you're going to be looking at. You can't make that stick. Try me. Oh. And it's going to be dirty, Vince, real dirty. What's that supposed to mean, Freddie? Well, if you don't know, it's not my place to tell you, not anymore. Good luck to you, babe. We're going to see you in court. [locker slams] [music playing] Old friends we don't see for so long. Salute. Cambodia. Good [inaudible]. Well, of course. Excuse please. Antonio. I always liked this place. Yea, me too. But I stopped coming. You know I always gave us a lot of credit for being able to handle a very touchy situation. Sophisticated. Civilized. At least nobody [inaudible] Oh, Louise got a little teary eyed. But we stayed friends kept on working together. That's very classy. At least [inaudible] Huh-uh. Among others, her daddy has a very long arm. I was afraid of that. We'll quit. She doesn't trust me yet. I get the feeling she's holding things back, you know. Things that everybody else knows including the cops. But me, I can't work that way. Tell her that. I'm telling you. You probably know the case. She was being blackmailed by Norma Addison. Casey's a lesbian. Oh, I knew there was something. I think I could always tell [inaudible] Can you? Why didn't she tell me? I think she was afraid you wouldn't want to defend her. Oh, that has nothing to do with it. it's not important. Everything's important. If the DA knows that she was being blackmailed by Addison, that gives her a motive, opportunity she already had. That's not good. I suppose daddy was hoping to [inaudible] It was an embarrassment to him. That's why he's for sweeping it under the rug. Exactly. Casey doesn't care anymore if the truth comes out. She wants it to. How do you know so much about it? We're close friends. How close? Very close. See, you can't always tell. [music playing] Can you? [music playing] Does it really bother you that much?a Well, it doesn't thrill me all that much. You want to bail out? There are a lot of other cases you've been working on, right? VINCE: I didn't say that. What you are saying is that with a stranger it's OK. But with somebody you've known, somebody, a woman you've made love to, that's a whole different story. Is that what you're saying? It just takes a little getting used to. Yea, I'm all for everybody, anybody doing everything and anything that turns them on as long as nobody gets hurt. Another [inaudible] You know I'm the one that has been shot through time [inaudible] You and Casey pretend to be something you're not. Sorry. It's my mistake. You're not who I thought you were either. [music playing] [horn honking] I defended a pair of Siamese twins one time, like a pair of bookends they were. Charged with indecent exposure. VINCE: Flashers? One of them was. We couldn't tell which one. They wouldn't snitch on each other. They were very close. So I decided to do defend them both. I figured even Siamese twins have a right to a good defense. And if it's right for the Siamese twins-- Glad get my meaning. They lied to me, Nate. MR. REDSTONE: Oh, they just left out a few things. But you're a smart boy, Vincent. You're catching on. Any harm done? It feels like it. Well, you're angry. And I don't blame you. But at whom? At Ellen for not showing up for work this morning or at your client? I'm not sure. One way to find out. I hear you. I don't believe you ever defended Siamese twins though. I didn't. But it made the point. - Mm-hm. - They we're triplets. [silly music toots] [music playing] There's a place, The Glitter Palace. Gay people go there. That's where I met Norma. She was nice at first, friendly. Then she introduced me to this beautiful woman, Grace Mayo. You don't know what it's like trying to come out. You walk into the Palace alone, scared. You don't know anyone. Then imagine if someone like Grace comes up to you. She's warm, friendly and she takes away the fear. And she makes you feel like-- like-- like you're not a freak. That it's OK. That she likes you. It's OK to like her. So we were together. You know, a lot. Then there with the photos. It began. And then I realized they were in it together. And they did it to other people, Norma, Grace, and the man who came to collect the money. You still saw Norma after that? CASEY: Here and there. She got around like a queen bee. She didn't pay much attention to me anymore. There were new victims for her to send Grace Mayo after. It's a terrific place, this Glitter Palace. Can you recommend a better place? Take it easy. I only meant-- CASEY: That it's tacky and de-humanizing? Yea, we all know that. But it's the kind of place we all start off at. Lots of us find friends, join other groups, women's centers. We move on if we can. Well, your advice is working like a charm so far, Kendis. My office has been in contact with the district attorney. And they're willing to make a deal just like you said they would. That's good news, Raymond. Yea, the only problem I've got is this young lawyer. Halloran? I warned you, a stubborn man. How do I proceed? I don't know if I should be saying this. I know. Technically, you're probably already overstepping bounds. Let's say bending the rules a bit. And I appreciate it. I'm in your hand,s Kendis. Casey and I in your hands. [birds chirping] How long has this blackmail been going on? Almost two years. I try not to think about it. It my daddy's money. He didn't mind paying? As long as I didn't make it to clear what he was paying for. VINCE: What happened that got you so hot at Norma and you went after her that night? Since I met Ellen, we've been very honest with each other. I began to really hate what Norma was doing and the blackmail. And I guess I had a little to drink, and I just let go. But I paid for it. How? At her house later. I came crawling, begging her not to punish me, not to use those photos. She forgave me like she was still playing the-- the great lady in some costume movie. She forgave me. She dismissed me. I went home and got sick. Why do want to know all this? If you didn't have enough reason to kill Norma that night, somebody else did. I'll be in touch. [knocking] [music playing] VINCE: ELLEN: Hey, I don't remember [inaudible] [gun shots] What? I said I will. I mean, I, as the attorney of record of the defendant, I am requesting the right to visit the house where the murder was committed. Why? Why the hell not Freddie? Norma's place is padlocked, under guard. That's why I'm here. I--Ia just want to go in and browse around like I used to. Hey, pretend it's like the old days, will you? It's not like the old days, Vince. Are you going to let me in? [gun shots] Are you? Oh, will you look at that, Vince? Now, did you ever see shooting like that? That's terrible. And I happen to be good. You upset me, Vince. Now, if you want to go over there and waste your time, what do I care. But it's going to take a court order. Then it's OK with you? Yea, tell the judge it's OK with me. I can't grant that to you, Mr. Halloran. The discovery process is vital to the defendant. I can't do it for you. Because I've already done it. I bet your pardon. Her lawyer's on behalf of the Addison estate. They have to prepare an inventory for probate. I signed an order ending the police quarantine two hours ago. [car engine roaring] [birds chirping] [dog growling and barking] I'm Halloran. This your dog? - I don't know the dog. It belongs to the dead lady. Nobody was taking care of him so I--I'm feeding him. Come on. [dog growling] Thank you. Friendly pup. Oh, yea, he's a good dog. You ah-- you going to be in here very later tonight? I'll be a little while. Say, here, I got time to be buying cigarettes? I'm out. Dirty habit. [dog growls] Lie down. Lie down. Now, stay there. [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] [DOG GROWLING WITH SPOOKY PIANO MUSIC] [sliding door slams] [suspenseful music] Get your smokes and you back so soon? [ominous oboe music] [blast of orchestra music] [piano music] [dog barks and growls] You sure? The address book is gone and two pages are torn out of the appointment calendar. Well, maybe you took them. If I took them, what am I doing standing here telling you about it. Oh, look, if there was a stranger around here, the dog would let me know. I'm certain he would. Maybe it wasn't a stranger. [traffic noises] [eerie music] [constructions noises] Hi. What can I get you? Scotch, neat. BARTENDER: Ah, everybody's favorite today. You seen Philip today? Philip who? You know Philip, Norma Addison's friend. Oh, that Philip. Yea. Never heard of him. You know Norma had a lot of friends. Poor thing. She'll be missed. By all. BARTENDER: Well, good for the bar. You a cop? Heh, do I look like a cop? Well, you sound like on. I'm the lawyer. Ah, well, that explains it. For who? Casey Walker. Nice kid. Didn't act snobby or anything. I mean, being a Travers, that's almost as good as being a Kennedy or a Rockefeller. You see her in here a lot? You must be very well paid representing a Travers. That'll be a $1.25. Out of $20? Keep the change. BARTENDER: Casey used to come in here a lot. Not too much lately. No fancy ass about her. Just like everybody else around here. Tell me about Norma Addision. The Queen. Oh, no pun intended. Good lady. Good tipper. More? There is no more. Oh, sure there is. Why ask me? Well, you did keep the change. And you're Joe, the friendly bartender. The old father confessor to all the regulars I can tell. You have the kind of face. Roger. Roger the kindly bartender. Normal have some special friends, Roger? Too numerous to mention. Let me ask you something. Or-- Or? I could get ideas. What is this? Once upon a time, I worked in a bar where some hustlers ran a badger game on the customers. [inaudible] and will [inaudible] and we'll turn them on to something, huh? Funny guy, right? Yea. Why, you like Grace Mayo? Who? You know, Gracie, everybody's favorite. [phone rings] If there's nothing else you want, so-- [phone rings] [music playing] [inaudible] Sure. I will. Would you like to dance? Why? Why not? Well, we probably don't see eye to eye on the basics. My, aren't we judgemental. [music playing] [inaudible] Ha ha. I saw Casey. Things don't look good, I assume. Yea, well, [inaudible] I didn't know [inaudible] going on for nearly a year. [inaudible] [music playing] Roy, I think he tried to follow me, but ah-- I lost him. DANKO: What'd he know? Well, there was a name [inaudible] remember? DANKO: Yea. So what do you think? [suspenseful music] BARTENDER: He had [inaudible]. Do you think the Travers kid killed Norma [inaudible] Roger, come on. She has a couple friend and he's got to be one of them. Acceptable. [inaudible] [suspenseful music] [inaudible] And we're not [inaudible] now. Right? You're [inaudible] [suspenseful music] [tires squealing] [suspenseful music] WOMAN IN GARAGE: Ag. Ag, help please. [inaudible] Oh, oh. [inaudible] Help. Help. Don't have to be anything, Vince, let along connected to a murder. Well, [inaudible] maybe the cause of death wasn't heart failure. [inaudible] jump off. I was the guy. [inaudible] for the first time. It may have been a lot of things [inaudible] [inaudible] corroborated. Paul. Now you upset me, Vince. You really upset me. Here [inaudible] together and now you're pulling things apart. Don't lie. Look, [inaudible] Warmth not [inaudible]. They both are. [inaudible] Isn't it possible [inaudible] somebody could have pushed her? It's possible. Yea, I guess. We're talking a faggot bartender who worked in a queer joint, not the most stable person around. It is just possible that it was tied in with the Addison thing. Want you go over and get your client out, her girlfriend. [inaudible] [inaudible] a potential victim. He was in on it with them. No, Vince, you're [inaudible] conversation and what you [inaudible] nothing. What have you got, Vince? Unsubstantiated, inconclusive conversation. There's no connection. How about the stuff that was taken from her house? An address book, torn pages, you say. You've been taking lessons from the great [inaudible]. He usually [inaudible] report, you know, [inaudible] and doing card tricks [inaudible]. It all adds up. When you're adding apples and oranges, all you get is fruit. Not [inaudible] Freddie. How come I never noticed that before? The cop was right, you know. Now, I'd do anything. I'd snap my galluses, shoot off firecrackers, drop my pants, anything to get the jury's attention and keep it. That's not the point, Nate. If I had to go into court tomorrow, I would lose. MR. REDSTONE: Well, of course you would. The cop was right. You haven't got anything. Are you absolutely certain that Casey never mentioned the name Philip? No, never. MR. REDSTONE: Could be the collection agency for the blackmail money. Maybe. Then there's the bartender. You know, I was getting to him with most of my shots until I got to Philip then drew a blank. He didn't know who I was talking about. MR. REDSTONE: Maybe Miss Norma kept secrets from the troops. - I hear ya. - Why would she do that? Demands of the sleazy profession she was in. She had to stockpile those dirty photographs somewhere for safekeeping. Hey, maybe that was Philip's job. Her appointment book was full of him, every two weeks like clockwork. Go to Philip. Go to Philip. Philip. Let's be logical. Philip. Animal, vegetable, or mineral? Had to be someone, something, somewhere-- But-- Vincent, you'll have to learn to pay attention here. Ellen-- You said somewhere. I got here a map. Now, P-- Phillip Street, D9. [odd music] [traffic noises] [inaudible] They send ya? Insurance company, you the adjuster? Oh, no. Name's Halloran. I'm a lawyer. Yea, well, lost it all. Fire totalled us out. Anybody hurt? You ever heard of a real estate office open at night? Wasn't anybody here except for whoever started the fire. I ah-- haven't had a chance to go over to the fire department. Vandals. Probably some kids. You know how they are today. Norma Addison owned this building, right? Oh, hey. You representing her, I mean her estate? Look, you're not going to hold up our claim are ya? I don't want to get involved in a [inaudible] Nothing like that. Just checking. Did you know her? Sure. Used to send the rent regular every month. She came around now and then to look at us, play landlord. She had some stuff in a locked file in storage. What kind of stuff? INSURANCE OWNER: Pictures, papers. Ah, once I peeked in on her when she was in there. She didn't like that. I never thought much of that. What did you do with that file? That one right there. [ominous music] Did everything burn in the fire? Except my little packet. A souvenir. That's my insurance. You think I'll renege on our little business arrangement? Heh, heh, heh. You ah-- you want me to take a peek at the pictures sometime, huh? I mean, just let me know. They're of you in a motel with Grace Mayo. I am going to get up and walk away from you. No, you're not. I'm just trying to find out what makes you tick, that's all. You never will so don't waste your time. I mean up there so high on your courthouse throne all week and then hitting it with a pal and trail on the weekends? We all have certain needs. Mine have to be satisfied discreetly. [birds chirping] I didn't choose it that way, but-- About the bartender, I suppose that was necessary. What's another one more or less among friends? You know you're still not out of trouble. You got two big problems, Halloran and your ah-- your friend, Grace. What about Grace? I've been trying to call her. Halloran probably has too. No answer. I went by her apartment. She took off. JUDGE WINSLOW: Where? I don't know. Do you think it's related to-- DANKO: No, no, no. From the start, she was a very dippy girl. She pulls this disappearing act now and then. Very well. [birds chirping] You find Grace Mayo. And I'll take care of Mr. Halloran. [suspenseful music] He's trying very hard. I'm impressed with Mr. Halloran. CASEY: You speak-- RAYMOND TRAVERS: If anybody can build an effective defense for you. CASEY: Think so, Dad? RAYMOND TRAVERS: Of course. CASEY: I was afraid. I-- RAYMOND TRAVERS: Why, because you selected him? Oh, at first I disagreed with him on strategy. My way we probably could avoid court and ah-- the risk of prison. But? But then I understood why and what you were trying do. And that's it. I can't admit to something I'm not guilty of, daddy. Even if it's tactically sound? I've got to be able to face myself. RAYMOND TRAVERS: And other people. Yes. People like those are going to be on the jury, 12 men and women who are going to look at you. We'll tell them the truth. RAYMOND TRAVERS: It won't be pleasant. I'm not scared. The DA will attack your background. He'll smear you. He'll call you names. He can't do that. RAYMOND TRAVERS: He'll say that you're a degenerate, a pervert, a lesbian. And those people, those people on the jury will look at you like your filth. And they'll convict you of anything you're charged with, of being different. And then, you'll be sent away to prison. You know what happens to pretty young girls like you in prison. Daddy, please. RAYMOND TRAVERS: Casey, I'm only trying to tell you what to expect. I can't protect you once you walk into that courtroom. [music playing] [traffic noises] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] So you're just going to quit. I did what I could. I was willing to do more. Daddy got to Casey. Now I got to hang it up. Those are the rules. Period. Talk to her. It's very difficult to do, babe, when she won't see me. She'll see me. [music playing] How'd you manage this? It's supposed to be just for lawyers. Hello Casey. ELLEN: Casey. Get out of here. ELLEN: It's all nerves. We can talk about it, can't we? Sure. I want to get out here. My father says he can guarantee that. He's got a lot of influence. What can you guarantee? I can't guarantee anything. There, you see? Remember what you told me about the pony, the one he gave you for your birthday? I was 11. And he said that it was yours except that you could only ride it when-- He said. I said it wasn't my pony then because he was putting conditions on the gift. I know what you're driving at. ELLEN: He's still giving you things. I never asked for them. ELLEN: But you take them. You're not a little girl anymore. It's your life. Do what you want to. You're doing the same thing he does. You're pressuring me. No. I love you. No conditions attached to that. Either way that won't change. Don't you know that? But you've got to decide on the quality of your life. What kind of person you'll be all come from that decision. Wh-- what are my chances? Well, if we find this [inaudible] tell me someone who had more to lose than you. Grace has disappeared? She's probably scared like I am. She's hiding. You'll never find her. Well, I have a pretty good guide. All right. Help me, please, if you can. [music playing] [people talking and gambling] I wouldn't be dressed up. I'd wear a tie. Army boots. [inaudible] Come on. [inaudible] When I was brought up in a small town where everybody was acquainted, you know? [inaudible] Tomboy. [inaudible] to pretend they weren't. Oh, hey you. She can hit a baseball further than a lumberjack. What'd she do to make a living? She worked at your local department store fitting maternity bras. [silly music] I used to play Vegas, not the lounges, headliner. Persian Room in New York, Chez Paree in Chicago, Fairmont in San Francisco. LA, I always played the Coconut Grove. Big rooms everywhere. I always did the big routine. They wanted to see me doing the Ed Sullivan Show. Classy people. You know, like Henny Youngman, take my mother-in-law please. Hard human routines about chasing guys. Always being the wallflower at dances. Yep. I owe Norma Addison a lot. That blackmailing tramp got me out of the closet. I didn't make a secret out of being gay. Lots of people in the business knew. Other places too. The Palace. That was the turning point for me. Running into my old buddy, Normal. Where'd you know her from? Oh, Hollywood party years ago. I got started near the end of her career out here. Norma was double-gated with a mean sense of humor in those days using everybody. Just like she was doing now, only now was worse. She set me up with Grace Mayo. Ah, set me up, yea. Photos, the whole thing? RAYMOND TRAVERS: Yea. And photos of me were worth a little bit of money. I was a celebrity. Norma said she'd sell them to scandal magazines and newspapers. So you paid? No. No, I threw open the door. And I popped out of the closet. And I ran up my true colors. And I started telling different. jokes. Well, I don't work the big rooms anymore. And they don't call me for the Bob Hope Special. Big cut in pay. But I'm doing fine as who I am. Ellen told me you could tell me about Grace Mayo. Oh, the little beauty. Sure. Now, listen don't laugh. But we got to be friends. I mean later, platonic friends. I mean she'd come over and talk to me. Bad as Normal had her hooks into her customers, it was worse for Grace. Grace had dreams of being a movie star. She was pretty enough. Do you know where we can find Grace? No. She hasn't been around lately. She's got other friends. They can probably tell you where she is. Where would we find them? [loud club noises and music] [inaudible] Hey question. ELLEN: That's what lawyers are for. Back when we together ah-- I mean before-- were you? I've been waiting for that. No, I wasn't. I didn't think so. Of course. When we were making love, I had to be swept away in a tidal wave of bliss. Well, I don't recall any complaints at the time. Are you asking or telling? Hey [inaudible] In the movies, when Redford kisses Streisand or Faye Dunaway, bells ring and lights go out. Well, that didn't happen to me. Well, we always aim to please. But every now and then, oh-- You were very nice, tender, gentle. But with you, or any man, it just didn't happen. Just being friendly. You feel friendly? Then shake hands. You kiss the guys in the office you like? I'll you something lady, I'm getting just a little sick and tired of walking around apologizing for being straight. Straight. It's a word. So is nigger. [big band music] There must be some mistake. PRISON GUARD: No sir. I'm R.D. Travers, her father. PRISON GUARD: I know that, sir. She specifically said she didn't want to see you. Mr. Travers. I was hoping I'd have a chance to-- Hey, do I look like a monster? I'm for freedom and justice for all. But there's a limit. And it's your money too, Nate. Old man Travers is--is turning the screws. The firm is losing clients on account of the Travers' case. I don't why it concerns them. Well, it's a pressure tactic. There's no mystery about that. Travers packs a lot of clout in this town. People don't walk, they run to do him favors. So what. So you're bucking him, Vince. And our firm is paying the price. I mean, he's got nothing to lose. But we do. That's right. Then you do see it? Sure I do. We got a lot to lose if we give into that kind of pressure. Well, let somebody else dirty their hands on this one. We're a blue chip corporate law operation. Hey, Merrill, ever been in jail? Me? Well, no, of course not. Well, I have 17 times in 12 different states, mostly just overnight. But it's the same thing, usually for contempt. But I have never shown the kind of contempt for the law that you have. Maybe when this is over, we ought to discuss some corporate changes here in our office. Yea, we ought to do that. Hey, Nate. Yea, what do you want? Thank you. Don't be too quick to thank me. You know, I've been around so long, I'm like a bad habit. Somebody will always be foolish enough to hire me. But you're newer in the game. Merrill's wrong. You got the most to lose. [stage commands] He bit me. DIRECTOR: Cut. Let's try it without the [inaudible] But he bit me. DIRECTOR: He supposed to bite you. Not like that. We never rehearsed it. DIRECTOR: Come on Baldy. We're running behind. This is motivation. What about the schedule? What about the schedule? [MANY PEOPLE TALKING IN BACKGROUND] They'll do it fast for you. Then you use up the bite before the girls even take their clothes off. You'll never be an artist, Ty. [MANY PEOPLE TALKING IN BACKGROUND] Check the time, please. Floyd, would you keep the set closed. Who is this? Did you bring somebody on the set? What is he doing here? No, he's looking for Grace. Oh, he's looking for Grace. And we're trying to make a movie here, are we not? Who are you? What do you want? Grace Mayo. I mean, I-- I-- I'm Halloran. I want Grace Mayo. Oh, you Grace Mayo. Well, let me tell you something about Grace Mayo. See, one thing I expect from my people is professional behavior. And Grace Mayo, she hung this up very bad. We gave her a very big chance here, a top featured role, vampire victim number one. Drusilla. - Oh. Oh. Well, she pulls a no show. No warning, no nothing, no respect for her fellow professionals. When did this happen? DIRECTOR: A couple of days ago. You see, it's really imperative that I reach her. Good luck to you. We phoned her. We sent telegrams. We left messages all over town. Did everything but send up a flare. CAMERA MAN: Camera's ready. - OK. Let's do it. Hey, hey, I thought-- Ready when you are. ACTRESS: Mister. Hey, hey mister. Oh. I heard you were looking for Grace Mayo. VINCE: Ah, yea, how do I find her? I saw you at the Glitter Palace with Ellen, you know, Casey's friend. Yea, well, that's-- that's what it's all about. I'm trying to help Grace. I didn't tell them. That I saw her the night before I started shooting. She came over to my place. She was stoned, I mean completely out of her head. Where is she now? I don't know. I said she could crash at my place. But she said she didn't want to and just took off. VINCE: Uh-huh. Th-- they gave me her part. I didn't ask for it. They gave me Grace's part. DIRECTOR: Sally, dear. Where the hell are you? - I gotta go. - Wait a minute. Isn't there anything else? I mean, is there anything you can tell me about her at all? Grace has a friend, Ricki Overton. You might try her. Ah, well, how do I find her? Where? Ah, she works as a bookkeeper at a karate studio somewhere over on Melrose. I-- don't know where. Karate studio. Maybe you should look it up. Huh. Ha. Ha. I'm sorry. This is a private class. I'm just trying to find Ricki Overton. Well, she doesn't work here anymore. Excuse me. You'll have to leave. I was just asking-- You're disturbing us. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Um, she was just telling me about Ricki Overton. - I was not - Ricki Overton. What were you telling? Nothing revealing. She doesn't work here. I only want to talk to Ricki for a minute. Well, you'll have to leave. Look, I-- Now. [sneaky music] Hi. Say, ah-- [inaudible] You followed me. I don't know, Ricki, but I gotta talk to her. Can I buy you a drink? I've already got a drink. [inaudible] I'm just trying to finish a conversation. It's about Ricki. What about Ricki? Vince. What are you doing here? He's asking about Ricki. Yea, I know. And I was just about to toss his tail out of here. How do you know Ricki? I don't know Ricki. She knows someone. Look, it's very complicated and I [inaudible] You some kind of cop? I'm a lawyer. A lawyer? Yea, a lawyer. OK. I'll bring him right over Ricki. OK. She said to come right over. Let's go. Thanks again everybody. Bye. Nice [inaudible] nice place for romance. We like it. VINCE: Yea. [inaudible] Let me check. Oh. Ah. Ah. Oh. Ah. [intense music] [knocking] [music playing] [knocking] [music playing] Who is it? VINCE: Me. [music playing] Evening? Morning. Ah. How do you feel? Heh, heh. How do I look? I asked you first. Lumpy. I feel lumpy. That's how you look. Oh. You should see the other guys, not a mark on'em. And they weren't even guys. You still talk in your sleep. Old blabbermouths. Why'd you got out alone? Wanted to finish the job. I didn't think you wanted to go around with me anymore. Well, why'd you come back here then? Automatic pilot after I stopped thinking. Well, I've started thinking. Am I'm going to like this? I think so. I don't ever want to apologize for being what I am. But you're right. I shouldn't ever make you apologize for being what you are. Well, while we're on the subject, I want you to know that I realized that some guys are turned on by redheads and others by brunettes and some by blondes and that I have come to know that ah-- I'm ah-- just not your type. And now, with some alacrity, I am going to attempt to accomplish the feat of putting myself on my feet. OK? You have a deep cough. ELLEN: You OK? You ever been hugged too hard? Why'd you do that? Ah, just being friendly. Well, the next time you feel like being friendly, you know, shake hands. [traffic noises] I just came by [inaudible] the bar [inaudible] VINCE: I'll be a gentleman. Oh, [inaudible] very hard to be [inaudible] with a gentleman protecting me. From my ex-husband. He wants to take Todd away from me. He's got to find us first. He's only doing it to hurt me. He likes to hurt me. I as a kid when we got married. He started beating me up. On Saturday nights in the beginning he'd get drunk and punch me around. And then it was any night of the week and he didn't have to be drunk. Is that when you left? No. I got pregnant to save our marriage to make it better. He kept on belting me around. I was in my 5th month and he punched me in the belly. And I got the message and took off. You say an ex-husband? Yea. I waited until Todd was born then filed for divorce. He fought it. During the opening at the court, mommy's a lesbian. The jury said that made me an unfit mother. How'd you get Todd? I stole him. That's what the court said. I abducted my son from his lawful guardian, his father. So when I said I was a lawyer-- My friend thought you were his lawyer. I'm sorry. They shouldn't have hurt you. But you're looking for Grace. Yes. Because of Norma. Do you know her? Just from listening to Grace talk about her. She was here, Grace. She stayed with me three days ago. She was all spaced out on pills and God knows what. I hoped she'd get her act together, but she just couldn't. She kept talking about a guy named Roy. She was scared to death of him. Do you know where we can find her now? Yea. I wished to God I didn't. But I do. GRACE MAYO (HUMMING): Hm, hm, hm, hm. ELLEN: Grace. Flower. Do you remember me? I'm Ellen, Casey's friend. Casey. We've been looking for you for a long time. There's just some things we have to know. So pretty inside. It's soft. It's wet inside. Listen to the rainbow. ELLEN: Did she hear anything I said? I don't think so. She's looking at the pretty colors. [suspenseful music] Ow. NURSE: OK, Grace Wait outside. Ow, it hurts me. NURSE: It's all right, Grace. It's all right. VOICE ON INTERCOM: Dr. Graham. Dr. Graham. All quiet. When is she going to come out of this? Maybe never. What do you mean never? NURSE: People call it taking a trip. It's like one of those times when there is no return ticket. It's comparable to an overdose. DANKO: Odds are she'll never come out of it. And if she does she's a slip. What if they were lying to you? Look, I called the hospital, told them I was the police. They told me everything. It's not enough. Well, that's all you're going to get. You're going to have to go out there and see her. Oh, come on. Why don't you leave the kid alone. She's never going to do anything. Just let her be. I'd like to. Don't you think I'd like to? Well, I'll tell you something. I ain't going to do it. Yes, you are. [eerie music] Hello Grace. [piano trill] [trumpet blast] VINCE: You know, it could be just a coincidence, first the bartender, then the fire, now this. It could be going down that way. Like every time I manage to pry open a door that gets me a little closer to one of Norma's customers, pow, it gets slammed in my face. Now, that could be just a string of-- Vince. coincidences and nobody told me. I upset you. Casey, I want to show you a series of pictures. They all have two things in common. They're licensed private investigators. And they have the same first name. Roy. Him. He's the one. He used to collect the blackmail money. Hi Roy. Do I know you? We know a lot of the same people. Oh yea? Like who? Casey Walker, Norma Addison. We figured it sooner. Norma needed somebody special. You know, tailing people, shooting pictures through keyholes to get around all that garbage. Who better than a private eye? Hey, ah-- that's very bright. Is that why you're here? You want me to help you find him, is that it? the yellow pages are full of them. Yea, and only four named Roy. Only one with your face. I showed Casey Walker your picture about an hour ago. You know, the one you filed for your ticket list. Do you want to put down the glassed. Get up and turn around. VINCE: I'm not armed. I'm looking to see if you might be wired. It's private, really. Accessory to blackmail, that'd get you five years for every count I dig up. But I'm not looking got that. I'm looking for the person that did Norma. Would you like to take a guess as to who that might be? Ah, heh, heh, heh. Man, are you fishing. I mean, you got nothing. You got an ID from a freak in jail. There's more. DANKO: More what? Clients being so scared they pay to keep it quiet. What good's that gonna do? I could always go to the cops. Well, you would have done that before. Come on, man, you're wasting my time. Take a hike. Sounds like he told you more than he wanted to. And I still got nothing. But he knows. He knows something. Maybe he's not scared enough of you. Nothing seems to scare him. That's what bothers me. Well, there must be somebody who can squeeze it out him. Or-- And you want help from me. Yes sir. After what you've done. After what's been done by me and by you. Roy Danko. How sure are you about him? Very sure. In fact, he may be the last link that could lead us to whoever killed Norma Addison. The only one that take Casey off the hook. Facts Mr. Halloran. You're not swaying a jury now. You don't have to believe me anymore than you believe Casey. Check it out. I mean, I think you should at least check it out. Billy. Yes, sir. Look into it. Certainly Mr. Travers. [tense music] [drum and loud horn music] [phone rings] Halloran. Halloran. My office, all my stuff. They wrecked it. Then they went into my apartment. What the hell did you tell them? I said I required your cooperation and you were withholding it. The guy, Billy Loomis, he works for Travers? They could wipe me out. There is that possibility. Unless you call them off. You want to meet somewhere and discuss that, Roy? Yea, yea, yea, we'll meat. And come along or I'll know. [engine revving] [tires squealing] [metal elevator door closing] VINCE: Nice say. DANKO: A nice day? You've given me a lot of trouble, Halloran. VINCE: Me? I hardly know you. DANKO: J.D. Travers is a very heavy dude. You got me on his bad list. Well, I'd say you worked your way up to qualifying, you and Norma. You're going to have to set him straight, cool it out for me. What are you going to do for me? You know the bartender, Roger, you know who I mean? VINCE: Yea. He wasted Norma. We were all in business together. We wanted a bigger slice. She didn't want to give it to him. He gave it to her. How do you know that? I saw him do it. I was there that night, outside. Roger didn't know I was there. I saw him kill her. Listen, if you negotiate for me, I'll swear to that. What do you say, counselor? Try again. What? Roger was working the bar at The Palace when Normal got hers. I checked. I know. I know. I know he left for an hour. Never hold up. Too many things have gone down since Roger was ah-- jumped or pushed. Look, how is that your responsibility? Your responsibility is to get Casey Travers out of the jug. Old habits, hard to break. You know, from working with the cops, you develop an instinct. Halloran, this is a very good deal all the way around. Then why don't I like it? You know, ever since I took this case, people have been telling me how to do the job offering me deals. Just take it. Norma was trash. In all her Paris clothes and her fancy hair, she was trash. Just close the book on her, huh? Maybe. Maybe what? Maybe I misjudged you. I had you figured as a guy who could point me in the right direction. But you've already been there yourself, haven't you? Take the deal. You can't make a deal with me. Because you already got one. Who's your new partner, Danko? Still doing all the dirty work yourself? Halloran, I thought you said you'd come alone. I thought I was. I'm going to get you, Halloran. [suspenseful music] Where's Loomis? Billy. What's going on here? I'm a nickel, dime guy. What do you want with me? I mean what's this-- BILLY LOOMIS: No you don't. Ag. Aah. He fell Halloran. You saw it. He fell. Yea, I saw it. Here let me try to-- No, no, the tapes. Every time we talked. It's not fair. She just beats it, walks away. Who? Norma's file on her and the tapes. She didn't know I taped her. The safe deposit key. The key in my pocket will save-- This line of questioning is totally irrelevant. And I advise you to abandon it, Mr. Brittenham and pursue a more productive area of inquiry. Yes, Your Honor. But I-- I-- You will follow my instructions Mr. Brittenham. Or I will hold you in contempt of this court. Yes, Your Honor. Now, Dr. Burman, I wonder if you would tell the court, in your own words, ah-- just exactly what was the co-- Mr. Brittenham, you are delaying the work of this court. If you desire a recess, you may request it. And I will consider it. [gavel pounds loudly] Mr. Brittenham. This behavior in my courtroom is disgraceful. [eerie music] [loud burst of organs] [flute music] [soft string music] Well, we did it, hm? [music playing] MR. REDSTONE: How you doing, Vincent? Only good. That's what I thought. I knew a man once. He had that same expression on his face. I was just a kid. He was an old guy named Tom Gabler. He didn't have anything. But he worked every day of his life. Finally, he saved up enough money to buy a diamond stick pin for his neck tie. I guess it really meant something to him. Well, anyway, it started raining out in the valley, plenty. We all grabbed shovels and started filling sandbags. Finally, we were just scooping up mud. Anyway, that stick pin he'd saved up for all that time was gone. We looked all over for it, couldn't find it. So everyone looked to Tom to see what he'd say. What di-- what did he say? Easy come, easy go. I like it. I don't believe it ever happened. It didn't. But it made the point. Come on, counselor, I'll buy you a drink. [music playing]
