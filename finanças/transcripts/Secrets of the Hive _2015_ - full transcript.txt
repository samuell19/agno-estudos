Narrator: we know we depend on bees. Man: everything that the doctor tells us to eat that is good for us is pollinated by bees. Narrator: we know honeybees are in crisis. Every year we lose about a third of our bees. But in fact, there is a huge and barely tapped world of wild bees out there. Man: so there are about 20,000 species of bees in the world. Narrator: each with a remarkable story. Even the most notorious species of bees has confounded expectations. Man: the prediction was these africanized bees would come in and pretty well take over and change everything. Narrator: one thing seems certain-- up close, bees are engaged in an epic struggle for survival that we're just beginning to understand. California's almond plantations are the largest in the world. Each february, an area the size of rhode island blooms, and gordon wardell gets busy. His job is to make sure everything gets pollinated. Like most farmers, he relies completely on one species-- the honeybee. Worldwide, about two thirds of our daily food is pollinated by honeybees. 1.8 million beehives are trucked in from around the country. With nearly $4 billion of almonds at stake, pollination has become a high-tech operation. And lately it has become more and more difficult for gordon to find enough honeybees for his almonds. Parasites, pesticides and many other factors have decimated honeybee populations. Gordon wardell: every year we lose about 30 % of our colonies, which is phenomenal. And that's the challenge that american beekeepers and almond growers and other growers have today is getting enough bees with the mortality that we're having in the honeybees. Narrator: the dramatic losses among honeybees have been termed "colony collapse disorder," and scientists are racing to understand and stop the die-off. Gordon wardell is on the forefront of a global honeybee crisis. Thousands of miles east, at an organic farm in west virginia, scientists are looking for alternative pollinators. In a squash field dr. T'ai roulston has his eye on an insect that looks a lot like the honeybee... ...but is actually a very different species. T'ai roulston: most farmers don't even know that it exists, even though it is probably the most important squash pollinator across the united states. So most farmers assume that maybe it's a honeybee in their squash. It's about the same color, about the same size, and the benefits that it gives are completely unknown to the farmers. Narrator: the species is aptly called the squash bee-- just one example of many wild bee species that pollinate our crops unnoticed. Squash bees live a peculiar life. The male spends all day flying from flower to flower searching for females. When he finds one, it takes just a few seconds to ensure future generations. Squash bees are solitary and don't live in colonies. Females build their own nests. Males choose a different flower each afternoon and settle in it before it closes. Inside, they have a safe place to spend the night. Early the next morning their working day begins again. Diverse vegetation near agricultural fields often accommodates wild bee species that could pollinate our crops. T'ai: when most people hear the word "bee," they think of just the honeybee, but there are about 20,000 species of bees in the world. Right here, so far, i have identified 147 species, right here on one square mile. Narrator: trees and abandoned barns also provide housing for pollinators. For instance, the leafcutter bee. Observation nests help t'ai study these bees. They are sometimes considered a pest to ornamental plants, but in fact they are important pollinators with a life cycle very different from honeybees. The leafcutter female earns her name by cutting little pieces from leaves to build a nest. She uses the leaves to build separation walls. And later plasters them with mud in preparation for her offspring. Only then can she begin to do the bees' work--look for pollen. Eventually she returns with loads of pollen sticking to her belly. It will serve as supplies for the larvae that will eventually develop in each chamber of her nest. That is, unless she isn't raided by another type of bee-- a parasitic coelioxys bee. Like a cuckoo bird, these bees lay their eggs in ready-made nests and let their offspring thrive on other bees' hard work. But in this case, the leafcutter bee stands her ground. In mexico, biologists are investigating how a different bee species also fights off invaders. At the national agricultural institute in queretaro, tugrul giray and jose uribe have been experimenting with a very special honeybee. First, they knock the bees out with co2. Then they place them under a petri dish. And finally their archenemy is introduced, a blood-sucking mite called varroa destructor. This little arachnid transmits diseases that can cripple a whole colony. It is the single most important cause of honeybee population decline. Within seconds, the varroa mite crawls onto its victim in search of a place where it can suck its blood. Most honeybees simply ignore these deadly parasites. But not these bees. They shake them off, and even more-- they try to bite the mites to death. Behavior that could mean a breakthrough against the greatest threat to honeybees. But tugrul and jose have to find out whether the varroa-fighting bees are aggressive only to parasites, or in general. It takes normal european honeybees about a minute to respond to an intruder and alarm the whole colony. These bees launch a full attack within seconds. [Buzzing] within one minute, 500 to 600 bees sting the small flag that tugrul and jose use as a standardized target. These bees don't differentiate between varroa mites or human intruders-- they protect their colony against both. They are africanized bees, also known as killer bees, a name that bespeaks their terrible reputation. In the 1990s, a few cases of deadly swarming behavior set off alarms. However, fears of a full-on deadly invasion never materialized. Africanized bees are not a distinct species. They're a hybrid of african and european bees with some different characteristics. And not all africanized bees are the same. Some colonies are less aggressive than others. It's those colonies that tugrul and jose want to use for breeding. Their goal--breed an africanized bee that is gentle but still resistant to the varroa mite. In order to breed gentler bees, jose has to make sure the queens are fertilized only by less aggressive drones. Artificial insemination is the solution. Over the course of five years, generation by generation, jose has bred gentler bees. But tests have shown to some extent he has simply bred the african genes out of his bees, making them also more susceptible to varroa again. It seems unlikely to have the best of both worlds-- gentle bees that are also resistant against varroa. In the wild, the untamed africanized bees still roam freely and show one of the most peculiar behaviors in the insect world. Like their european cousins, africanized bees from time to time leave their hive and begin looking for a new home, a behavior known as swarming. Africanized bees do this more often and sometimes even target an existing apiary. Honeybee queens live 50 times as long as a normal bee, but eventually they become old and weak. When that happens, africanized bee scouts take a closer look at the colony. Once they've identified a weak colony, they launch the full attack. The goal of the invaders is to get inside and locate the queen as quickly as possible. Once they have found her, they form a ball around her. They don't sting a queen to death, but instead suffocate her under dozens of bodies. The invaders will take over all of the supplies the colony has collected so far. And once the old queen is dead, the new queen can take reign. Every bee that is not dead by now will accept her as queen and work for her. Not only that, all the bees that hatch from the larvae and eggs will also be enslaved. African honeybees came to brazil in the 1950s. From there they spread across the americas. Biologists feared they would wreak havoc in every ecosystem in their path. In 1979, they were expected to hit panama. David roubik: tropical forest and the honeybees were a completely new combination in this part of the world. And i was supposed to study what impact it had on the native wildlife, the native plants and animals. No one had studied this before anywhere in the world. Narrator: when david roubik began research at the smithsonian tropical research institute in panama, the prevailing outlook was grim. David: a loose honeybee in the system, it's kind of like a loose cannon. You don't know what it's going to do, but the prediction was these africanized bees would come in and pretty well take over and change everything and maybe cause some bees to go extinct. Narrator: david began his work with one of the many native bee species in panama-- trigona fulviventris. It doesn't even have a common name. There is still much to learn about this bee species, but what is known is that it's a valuable pollinator of the noni fruit and forest plants. They nest under trees with just a single entrance tube to reach the surface. Colonies stay under their tree for half a century or longer, and guard bees maintain a constant vigil to make sure no other colony tries to move in nearby. A few bees are always positioned in the entrance tube to fan fresh air into the nest and regulate the temperature. And they're probably the shyest bee species in the world. David needed to do a population census of a colony three feet underground. His approach then, as today, is simple-- a stick and plastic bag capture bees leaving the nest. Then he marks the bees... ...and returns them to the wild. The number of marked bees he recaptures later tells him how big the colony is. David has been studying these colonies for more than three decades. They remain stable. Africanized bees may not have such a dramatic negative effect on native bees after all. But trigona fulviventris is just one of the many bee species in this region. Would other native bees also cope as well? To study another more elusive bee of the tropical forest, david uses scent baits with odors of wintergreen, eucalyptus and clove. And before long, they appear-- orchid bees-- in all shapes and colors. In panama alone there are more than 50 species of orchid bees. They pollinate exotic fruits like tree tomatoes and vanilla. But these bees have come for a different purpose. Male orchid bees collect scent from the paper with their forelegs and rub it into specially designed pouches in their hind legs. By mixing several fragrances together, each species designs its own distinct perfume. And during mating season, each male selects one particular tree and begins his mating ceremony. He perches on the side of the tree and disperses the perfume from his hind legs. If the conditions are right, he might attract a female. David: collecting the odors is a way that a male can say exactly how good he has performed. He can't pretend he did more, he can't pretend he's bigger than he is or he's smarter than he is. He is exactly the worth of the odor he is carrying in his leg, and it's a beautiful system. A female can judge what male really she wants to mate with just on that. Narrator: and if the perfume isn't good enough, it means the male has to collect some more odors. The baits attract many species. Among them, the biggest of all orchid bees in panama-- eulaema bombiformis. A good two inches long, these bees are known to pollinate brazil nuts. After 35 years in the field, david can tell more than 250 species apart simply by looking at them. And the results of his long-term study are surprising. David: i've been looking at this in three big forest preserves in panama-- nothing is going down, they are not going down in number. So bees are either not changing or they are getting more numerous. There are not more species, there are just more individuals, there are more of them. So something is happening that favors bees. And they're actually either surviving better or getting fed more or reproducing more, but it's an unmistakable trend. And i've looked at it for 35 years. I know it's really there. Narrator: the africanized honeybee didn't decimate the wild bees in panama. The question remains--why? One stingless bee of panama has provided a wealth of information-- melipona panamica. They're quite similar to our honeybee. They live in hives, forage for pollen and nectar, and make honey. Rather than use wax to make honeycombs, they build their nest with river stones. But to glue the rocks together, they need another building material-- resin from trees. But patches of resin also attract predators that prey on bees. Eventually, the builder bees prevail, ensuring a safe haven for the bees returning from their foraging trips... ...who return to their colony with many types of pollen sticking to their legs. That pollen holds clues to where the bees have been, which flowers they use to feed the colony. David's goal is to determine if africanized bees and native bees compete for the same flowers. Samples of the pollen they brought to their nest allow him to answer that question. Melipona bees store their pollen, like their honey, in small pots made out of cerumen, a special, flexible type of wax. But pollen samples are only the beginning of a truly sisyphean undertaking. Pollen is like fingerprints. Each species of plant has a distinct characteristic. If you learn how to read it, you can identify the flowers the bees have visited. The only problem is the diversity of the tropical forest. On barro colorado island alone, there are about 2,000 flowering plants. Over the course of decades, david and his team identified and described pollen for thousands of plants, showing that africanized honeybees and native stingless bees are indeed living off the same flowers. How can both native and honeybees be thriving if they compete for the same food source? David looks for the answer 150 feet up in the air. In the tropics, most flowers are on trees, and that means this is where the bees are. Up here, david has catalogued dozens of native bee species and what they forage on. And time and again, he saw africanized honeybees forage on flowers, like this palm tree, in harmony with the native bees. David: we thought it would be like an atom bomb dropping, we thought the africanized honeybee would just fan out in all directions and take all the food, and for anything else that wanted food from flowers, they'd just be out of luck. But down the road, they give back what they're taking. They're pollinating well, it makes those flowers more abundant than they were before. This is what we've found. Narrator: what is true for the tropical rainforest has actually been demonstrated in agriculture as well. The best pollination effect happens when both honeybees and wild bees are present. But for wild bees to thrive, they need untamed, diverse habitat. Back in west virginia, the diverse vegetation of the uncultivated areas between farmlands is home to the best-known relative of the honeybee-- the bumblebee. Some bumblebee populations are in decline-- a tragedy, since they are among the few bees capable of buzz pollination. This technique is the only efficient way to pollinate plants like tomatoes, eggplants and blueberries. The bumblebee grabs the flower by the anthers, decouples its flight muscles from the wings and uses them to shake the flower violently... the only way to get the blossom to dislodge its pollen... ...which the bumblebees bring back to their colony. T'ai roulston and his team are trying to figure out why some bumblebee populations are in decline. Like honeybees, bumblebees also live in colonies and even store their honey in little pots. But the colonies' hustle only lasts for one summer. To track the bees coming and leaving the hive, he glues rfid tags to their backs. Similar to pet chips, they allow him to identify each bee. And with their little transponder backpack, they are released back into the wild. An electronic gate at the hive entrance tracks the departure and arrival of every bee. But the data is puzzling. Woman: look, the same bee stayed out again the next night. T'ai: so is this a case where... we got two overnights in a row. Is that the same bee? Woman: this is the same bee, so this is interesting. T'ai: without any foraging trips in between. Woman: it seems like we're making a lot of assumptions about what bees are doing, you know, particularly at night, 'cause you expect that they're all going to come home before the end of the workday. And now it seems like that's pretty consistently not the case. T'ai: right. Narrator: at dusk t'ai and his team are searching for the a.w.o.l. bees. They find them resting underneath leaves, almost immobilized by the cooler temperature. T'ai: ok, just scoop it up. Get the same vial as long as i'm quick about it. Narrator: close observation reveals what's going on. Another insect is hatching from the bumblebee's carcass-- the conopid fly. This fly lurks near flowers to catch bumblebees and lays its egg into the still-living bee. The bumblebee works as long as possible while the larva develops inside her. [Bird chirps] at night the infected bumblebee stays out in the cool air probably to slow the development of the larva. But eventually the larva in the bumblebee matures and takes control of the bee, commanding it to dig its own grave. The chances for the fly to survive the winter are much higher if the bumblebee is underground. T'ai and his team suspect that the disappearance of diverse vegetation has a double hit on bumblebee populations. Not only do they lose their habitat and resources, they may also be more likely to be attacked by parasites like the conopid fly, since they are crowded onto fewer flowers. Loss of habitat is the greatest threat to wild bees around the world. We're just beginning to fully understand the complicated relationship between flowers, bees, and their habitat. Tugrul giray has come from mexico to puerto rico to study the fascinating development of africanized bees on the island. Tugrul giray: first killer bees arrived in puerto rico in 1994. The first four years, every year one person died. The last one was a two-year-old kid who was killed by these bees. Narrator: every year there were also hundreds of non-lethal incidents. [Buzzing] but when tugrul took a closer look at the data, he found something strange. The number of attacks was going down. Within just a few years, the bees seem to have become different--gentler. Tugrul: but there has been no deaths since '97. So we think they have changed. Narrator: in puerto rico, africanized bees can now be handled like normal bees. Tugrul and his team regularly capture africanized bee swarms to study them. All they have to do is identify the queen, capture her, and the rest of the swarm will follow. Tugrul wants to understand why the africanized bees in puerto rico have become so gentle. One possibility is that they interbred with european honeybees. But genetic tests indicate this is not the case. He observes colonies all over the island. His suspicion is that the bees may have changed the way they organize their colony. Each bee in a hive has a specific job. For instance, the bees that protect a hive and will sting any intruder are called soldiers. The bees that leave the hive looking for pollen and nectar are called foragers. They are much less likely to sting. The team uses a funnel to count the number of foragers that leave the colony. Astonishingly, in puerto rico, colonies of africanized bees have more foragers in relation to the colony's size than africanized bees anywhere else. There could be many reasons for this. But tugrul hypothesizes that the environment might be a factor. Puerto rico is an island, and the bees cannot escape the seasonal changes here. During the dry season, flowers are abundant and the colonies thrive. But there is a second season... [rain falling] the wet season. This is a much more dire season for the bees. There are fewer flowers. And heavy tropical rain deters the bees from foraging trips. Since for half a year food is harder to come by, tugrul suspects the colonies need more foragers than soldiers, making the colony as a whole more gentle, while retaining varroa-fighting african genes. Research is ongoing, but tugrul is optimistic. Tugrul: understanding the genes important for this change can be useful for changing africanized bees or for breeding other bees. This may be the holy grail of beekeeping, so it's gentle bees and resistant to varroa. Narrator: but nevertheless, t'ai roulston believes we should not continue to make the same mistakes. T'ai: all of agriculture rely on a single species really means that a lot of the food that people eat hinges on this one species doing well. And the problems are tackled one at a time, they are never solved. So having other bees around that are contributing to agricultural pollination provides a safety net for agriculture in general. Narrator: but for this safety net to exist, we must not turn everything into farmland. Bees need wild flower zones near our fields and large areas of rich, diverse vegetation. David: this is a pollinator reserve. You don't go and buy pollinators on some other planet and bring them here after you've caused them all to go away. So we've got to play this game right. And we're really close to the point we have to decide how much agriculture, how much pollinator reserves, and how many different kinds of pollinators that we can manage and have in the right place, the right way, in the right time. Narrator: back in california, recent drought conditions have made it difficult for gordon wardell to diversify the vegetation. But he is nevertheless experimenting with a different species of bees. His intention is to share the load of pollination between honeybees and a species called blue orchard bees. These solitary bees stay in a cocoon over the winter, and in spring they are ready to hatch and get to work. Gordon: it's not a luxury anymore, it's a necessity. And we have to manage the wild pollinators into the orchards, into the fields to pollinate these crops that feed the world. Narrator: on average, blue orchard bees visit 50 times as many flowers as a honeybee-- a pollination service badly needed. It's a promising start for gordon, and a testament to the lessons being learned around the globe.
