No! Ugh! Oh my god! Fuck. Help me! No! Help me. An offering for the poor of the church? Forget about the church. And we may as well forget the tavern, too, huh? That is, you should only be thinking about what's necessary for a young man to survive to find a job. But tell me, how long has it been since you've gone to mass? Yeah. You're young. Thank you. You still have time. Well, you believe in goodwill and having done something to help a little boy, but that's not true. He can't help himself by depending on alcohol. Alcohol is never a solution to anyone's problems. And this is something about you men of the church that I don't really understand. You can't accept that someone can truly survive without having something to search for. We all have got something for which we are searching. But not many, very few people, that are actually searching have the strength. In memory of our deceased, on this solemn day, we pray. Hey. Later, Francesco. The marshal is here. I'm not able to. I'll pass by at 9:00 PM. Brothers, sisters. I have to study tonight. Come on, I promise we won't be out late. I'm too far behind with my exams. I'll call you tomorrow. To then find ourselves following ideologies that have nothing to do with the path our Lord has chosen for us. Because there is only one thing certain. The evil that surrounds you can strike at any moment. Where's the toilet? If you mean the bathroom, it's to the right over there. Where did he come from? Was there a general amnesty? And he was all over you with his eyes. Like everyone does. He looks like a jerk. You want me to wait for you? When have you ever liked a man? Why don't you go home? It's late. I'm closing shortly, anyway. I'll just kick him out. Well, just be careful. I will. Don't worry. So, beautiful hot babe, give me a vodka, will you? And make it double. And whatever you'll be having. Oh, I don't need anymore, thanks. Yeah, you really do have more than enough for any man. But I must say, I'm curious. When you get off work? I bet you've got a boyfriend. Is that it? I bet you're masturbate him with these pretty hands. Thanks, guys. Buona notte. You're not afraid of being left alone with the boogeyman? No, because the bar is closing and the boogeyman is leaving. I'd say he better leave. Otherwise, you'll get horny? You see, I was right. I see right through you. How long since you've had a good fucking? Don't you know that I like surprises? And what kind of surprise would you like? What fun would that be if I told you? Why don't you try and surprise me? Easy. Learn how to wait. You want something to drink? You're more horny than I am, bitch! Just better not make me angry. And what happens if I make you angry? I can be very dangerous! Good. I love a man who can get dangerous. How do you want to fuck me? We were innocent and condemned to die! Now it is time for those who have forgotten to remember those who have dared to pay. Rejoice, sisters. And very soon, all that has to be will take place. I ask myself if it's right to sacrifice all that we have. What we have is nothing compared to what they took from us. You are one of us now! Perhaps I'm still not. Indecision is not tolerated! Our army is here, and your guidance is all that we ask. Something is wrong. There's something different this time. You mean "someone different." It's as if there were two presences, two presences with only one cerebral activity. And this is what I don't understand. When you know only what you see, then you know almost nothing! Free her! Who dares to disturb me, cock-sucking assholes? I'll kill you. I'll destroy you. Where are you? Come here. That's enough! Right away! Excuse me for insisting, but you haven't heard from your husband in more than five days, correct? How many times do I have to say it? Delos, you don't have to insist. Thank you. I just don't understand why it wasn't reported to us, that is. I was the one who told them to wait. Even now, all this attention seems a bit exaggerated, as if my husband's responsibilities weren't enough for us already. I'm sure that Giancarlo will be back within a couple of days. Sugar? Yes, just one, thanks. You-- Lately, I have been spending all my time in the office. Even if I wanted to, I-- But why shouldn't you want-- I can't help you. I'm sorry. The lady asked you a question. You could respond. Where are your manners? Two sugars, thanks. Quite frankly, it seems to me that she doesn't care at all. Unlike yourself, I do know the man very well. He's prone to have a little fling now and again, but he always comes back. The mayor as well, it was as if-- As if he didn't want it known in town that his son-in-law had left his only daughter to see a prostitute. Hey, it seems reasonable, doesn't it? Yes, but it's the third person who's missing in the last five days. He's the third person who left home, Brigadier. Oh, Mr. Mayor. I was just saying to the brigadier that the situation is under control and there is no need to worry, sir. But this time there is something. Your wife and daughter-- Perrosi. You have noticed, right? They've been acting strangely for days. Tell your superiors that something is going on. Quite frankly, sir, the situation is always what it is. For now, there's no real motive to invent stories that don't really exist, sir. Find then. It means I'll take care of it myself. I preferred to ask a favor from a marshal, but I'll have to settle for a senator. Are you quite sure, and do you realize what all of this means for your work? As well as for ours? Yes, I must say I do. But don't you see? I can't continue like this! Then we have a problem. We have always demonstrated great respect for your special activity. But I've never doubted the contrary! You must admit that we've supplied you with the men indicated by you personally, even a layperson as well as as a supposed witchdoctor. And I am grateful for that. But I-- about that night. I don't-- And it's about that night when you were given something most special. Which I no longer have the strength to bear. Do you know what you're saying? That you no longer have the intention of saving lives. I can forward your request this very day, if this is what you want. But is this truly your wish? Have you lost the faith, Father Gabriel? You know I'm afraid! Have you lost the faith, Father Gabriel? Whether he lost the faith or not isn't my concern. All I can say is that Gabriel, Father Gabriel, can't go on like this anymore. My collaborators have told me that it's been very hard on him lately, that he's been having some difficulties. But it's happened before, and the strength of his faith has been a force that-- a force that has always been there to protect him. In matters of faith, I'll leave that to you. I personally prefer methods a bit more scientific. And from a medical standpoint, I can guarantee you that Father Gabriel would not be able to withstand certain things for much longer. One of the motives why I prefer not to deal with you is, is that when a fact is only explainable by faith, you people call it "a thing." Many things throughout the centuries have been considered by faith alone, until science arrived to explain them. And from a point of view that we could define scientific, what is the possibility, in real terms, that Father Gabriel has to survive his next outing? To save him this last time we needed nothing short of a miracle. I'm afraid next time, we're gonna need a real one. Father Emilio. Father Emilio. Father Emilio! Oh! Ah! Help me! Help me! Can you tell me what in the world is wrong with you? Coming from the crypt. There were-- there were-- What is it? Huh? What is that? There were snakes. There were snakes. Snakes? Are you sure? Hundreds, hundreds of snakes. You must believe me. Black ones, black ones! Let's take a look. Fathers Secondo. Father Secondo, come forward. I swear to you, Father Emilio. I swear that I-- I-- I saw them. They were here, here. I swear to you. Father Secondo, you have been working too hard lately. Why don't you take a few days off and get some rest, all right? All right. Isn't that your? Yes, yes. It's mine. But-- I cannot take it anymore. What's the matter with you now? This silence isn't helping me, you know. I would understand if you were, I don't know, religious. But I don't think that-- You know that's not the real reason. Well, then, what? Why is it so important, your-- your-- Virginity, huh? It's important. It's really important for me to nurture the joy and honor, to nurture love and devotion and to put aside silly desires for maybe a greater prize. But I am your prize. It's a part of it. Yeah, I knew it. I should have kept my mouth shut. What is it, darling? That strange dog. Father Secondo, I didn't mean to startle you. No, no. I was just a little distracted. I want to go to confession. Really? Well, perhaps tomorrow would be better, huh? Right now I'm-- Father Secondo, when has the church ever stopped welcoming its own faithful? You're right, Father Emilio. Father Emilio is perfectly right. The Lord doesn't keep bankers' hours. Isn't that true, Father? Yes, of course. That's perfectly true. Come. Come with me. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, I'm-- I'm listening. Father, can you confess a sin that you haven't committed yet? Are you referring to something that-- something that is about to happen? With reference to me. What is it that torments you? There are many things, Father. Things that I don't quite know for sure. I don't know who I am anymore. I see a woman who is suffering without being able to know the reason. It's more like fear, not suffering. You're afraid? Of what, child? Of making a mistake by coming here and not seeing it to the end. Father, is it a sin to betray yourself, when in the end, it saves you? You know, sometimes there are questions that only your faith is able to answer. You mustn't be afraid to place your trust in the Lord. I've decided to do just that. It's not a sin to make a mistake or betray ourselves, if in the long run, our actions are intended for good measures. The point is, how much pain must one endure? Ha. If you have faith, no pain is more than your body can bear. That's what I'm hoping, Father. What I'm hoping for you! Now go to sleep. It's late. Can we play that game again tomorrow? Now, what game is that? Making magic. Magic? We never played this game before. Who taught you these things? Aunt Sibilla. She took me to this place once. Not all things that are fun are good things. Is magic a bad thing? Well, it depends on who does it. Now, sleep. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time waking up tomorrow. Good night. But you are forgetting what they did to us. It's our destiny. That's bullshit. My daughter and I have a life together. She'll be a free woman in a world much better than an infernal one. Do you really want to be a slave to a demon? We won't be slaves to anyone. It's the prophecy that gives purpose to our lives. We sisters are different, more than different. I know it's true. Maybe you're right. And maybe not. What if Sibilla isn't right? If we repeat history, we were exterminated. I saw them burn my sisters. I can't allow the same thing to happen to my daughter! I understand what you're saying, even though I think you're wrong. But Sibilla, I don't think she'd be so understanding. You know what she'd say. "You're for us or against us." And if something were to happen to my daughter, your worst enemy will not be a priest. Poor Secondo. Sorry, Father, but how is this right? He who commits suicide hates life, despises it. Well, you really have to hate yourself to end up like this. Maybe he was, I don't know, depressed or-- did you notice anything strange? Why are you asking me? If he had been showing signs of erratic behavior, depression, or I don't know, a death in the family? No, no. His life was here. This was his family. But he seemed as if he no longer felt at home. What do you mean by that? He lost his way. Doubt can easily creep into a heart that is weak. So you are saying he lost the faith? Pretty tough for a priest, huh? Father Emilio, forgive me, but Fathers Secondo here, was he by any chance into sports? I don't really think so. Why do you ask? Because not even Michael Jordan can reach this beam. And I don't see any ladder around. That's enough now, Brigadier. Stop with your stupid theories. This is a peaceful town. But what the fuck are you doing? Marshal, sir, this used to be a peaceful town. Honey, don't ask any questions. Please don't ask. Just do what I tell you. I'll explain later. Prepare a suitcase with as many things as you can. You'll be away for a while. No. But I really wish I could. Brigadier, may I help you with something? Oh, Filomena, please tell the Mayor I must speak with him. What about? It's none of your business. It's an emergency. Oh, it's an emergency? And what happened? A squatter in a no parking zone? Is that it? No, I'll speak directly to the Mayor. My apologies, but the Mayor isn't in. Where is he? I don't know. I'm his secretary, not his wife. Are you sure he's not in? Mr. Mayor? Mr. Mayor? All right, forget it, forget it. I'll just call him on his cell phone. How is that possible? There is no signal. Oh, that's strange. There's always been one. You can leave him a message, if you want. No, no. I'll call him from a landline. There must be a phone in the office, no? I'm sorry, but he doesn't want anyone to-- Yes, it's not important. It's not important. I'll call him tomorrow. Come on, Sara, give me the bag. Now will you tell me what's happening? Yes, now I can tell you. You are in danger. We are all in danger! I don't know who they are, but something happened here, Sara. People are disappearing. Now the Mayor is gone. Look, they killed the priest, and that I know. Who, Father Emilio? The other one, the assistant. There's something. There is something in this town, Sara. And I'm sure that it's evil. Filomena, the-- the Mayor's secretary, no? You know her, right? She-- she looked at me with those eyes. Filomena? What do you mean? Filomena is-- She's one of them. I know it. Oh. Colonel, it's true. The Mayor's son-in-law has not been found. But try to understand that it's a delicate situation. You don't want to make a huge fuss over a little fling. No. No. No need to worry. Everything else is fine. This is a peaceful town, as you are aware. Of course, Colonel. I will keep you assured. Was I good enough, Marshal? Do you want him? You can have him. Thank you, Father. Have a nice day. To you as well. Be seeing you. Please prepare a room. Thanks. I've seen your choices. You know I've envied you over the years. All that they did was to choose a peaceful town and wait for death to come. And finally face all of the ghosts you've seen one by one. Whereas in the last 15 years, I've continued to torture myself. And what have you found out? That the only thing to do is to never stop asking questions. What's important are the lives you continue to save, dear friend. Or all those I could have saved, if I were able to defeat the evil that's inside of me. I, too, have asked myself many questions about that night. No! No! No! Have you ever thought the evil may have entered us because it's found a piece of him inside each one? We were two exorcists that stared evil in the face, and maybe we just made the mistake of looking him in the eye and confronting him head-on. No, we haven't made any errors. We did what had to be done for them. Perhaps there were something already dark inside of us, and it was that part that wanted to happen. They couldn't help themselves then. And we can't help today, unfortunately, if we continue to carry the terrible burden of our choices. Tell me why you're here. Father Secondo sent me this before he died. By suicide. So this is what you have come for, hm? Father Secondo wrote to me about the strange occurrences that happen here. At first, I did not believe him and all the things he said. But when I noticed that few people kept coming to mass every day, throughout the whole town, it's as if each person was suddenly afraid. Unfortunately, there are many things that make us afraid. Real fear. Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us? Thank you, Father. Just a few minutes more. That's very kind of you. And also for the-- It's just the herbal tea. And to think that the ingredients have been the same for centuries. And what are those? Oh, it's a secret that only us women know. The women here have had to learn how to keep their mouth closed, and at a hard price, too. I see your point. Luckily, the tea has remained the same. Only the times have changed. Hmph. Do you really believe that, Father? And I'm not the only one. It's a fact. You are a free woman. I mean, the church says-- You mean, the church says a woman was responsible for the loss of your heaven, right? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to speak out of turn. Say what you mean, hm? No apologies are necessary. You have a point. We may have made many mistakes in the past, that's true. Tragic mistakes. And we have asked to be forgiven. And you are absolved. But there are those who haven't been able to forget now. There are some nights that you can still hear them, the cries of pain and the cries of the innocents. And they were burned alive for nothing. You dwell in the past. Maybe you should appreciate the present. And if you don't like it, look to build a future. Whosoever sows pain and plants suffering will gather its fruits. And this is the future for which I fight. Your room is prepared now. Father Emilio! Father Emilio! Father Emilio! You are the salvation or the disaster. This is no time to hide. The time has come to show yourself! I truly hope to see you again. Certainly. Sounds great. What time are we there? Yeah, this will be at my place at 9:00. Perfect. It's so nice to be together before-- we are not open yet. I'd just like a glass of water. Did you see something you like, Father? I'd say something quite interesting. Well, if there isn't anything else you want-- No, thanks. I'm fine. I've often asked myself if this day would ever come. And now we're here to celebrate it. Sibilla said it would be so. Let's make a toast to her. Mama. Oh, sweetheart. Did we wake you? I had a bad dream. A man wanted to kill us. Sweetheart, no one is going to hurt you. At the end of the 16th century, six women began to meet with each other on the night of the Cabotina. They were keepers of ancient knowledge, farm folk desperate from the drought, and girls who weren't able to have children, mothers with babies who died in their arms. Everyone in town had turned to these women and their magic powers for help. But then from Rome came the Holy Inquisition. Those men were incapable of separating the faith from power, and they started to spread rumors and falsify the truth about those poor, young women. And what of the townspeople? When the people realized who wielded the power, they began to follow them blindly. The women became beings to flee from and curse their magic. Better still, to eliminate. The trial was completely a farce. They were condemned to death without appeal. They were heinously burned alive. But if the magic powers of those women were-- Benevolent, well, then why did they become so terrible? You men will never be able to imagine what the fury of six women humiliated and massacred for no real motive can do. It can happen as it may. Someone was ready to harness that fury. The last one was Sibilla. More than 500 years have passed. By now, the time is upon us. Who are you? And why do you ask that which you already know? I am one of them, a witch who has remained intact with her ideals that is different from you men. I've never known any other mortal who has had the courage to look me in the eye. You're not afraid. Only those who have known the darkest fears have the possibility to make it, accept what is happening and win. All of us are now ready to do our part. And are you ready to do yours? You doubt me? You should be thanking me. Thanking you? You were only following your master's orders. And he has a promise to maintain with us. And he will keep it. His gesture breaks a truce that's been disseminated for an eternity. And what do you have to gain by all of this? To bring a piece of hell to this planet. Is everything ready for the ceremony? Yes, this will be simple to do, compared to the events it will unleash, to the destinies it will change and will be swept away. You said you were ready. You will not be deluded by us, my liege. When all has been done, you will have what was promised. You wanted to be the queen of the night, eh? And so you shall. My power is now great. Together, we are mighty, but there is still one more obstacle between us and glory. Weak as much as a man can be, strong as much as fate will allow it. Underestimating an enemy, although Insignificant, is a very foolish thing to do! That's enough. I purge you, evil, malevolent things, in the name of the Lord! It's about today. I know. How could all of you have gotten this far? This is the place. The blood of the earth. Where the souls of the damned burn in eternity. I've never seen such a place. You mean it's not scientifically explainable? All this black water. Not water but blood, blood of the earth. This place, it seems just like-- Like what? A gateway to Hell. Fascinating. It's really too bad that this kind of soil can be found in any volcano. Follow me. Then you'll see that all will go as it must. This is no ordinary volcano. So what you're saying is, by following the river, you'll eventually reach Hell? Gabriel has been through here. And he's not alone. There's somebody else who's with him. We must allow our faith to guide us. It's able to perceive heat trails left by other living beings. If someone has been here in the last few hours, we'll know within moments of a prayer. Someone's been through here. Come on. Father Emilio, Father Emilio! It isn't me. It is you who no longer believes in me. My Lord and God, if you want me to be your soldier, then give me your strength. Do not forsake me now. Upon death be. How could you betray the Lord your God? You call it "betrayal," but for me, it was a revelation. Like all betrayers, you are only looking to justify yourself. You have betrayed misery for candor, the feeling of guilt for that of omnipotence. Reap what you have sewn and bereave those who wait for you. The choice is yours. I have already chosen. I want to be an obedient servant, not a master. Obedience is not a virtue, the most deceitful of temptations. It's very sad, master, not to have realized who I am until just now. I absolve you for the sin of modesty, and I condemn you for your stupidity! Die, die, you fucking priest! Now it's time to die! Well, is that all you've got? I honestly expected something more from the Vatican torturers. You inquisitors don't have the guts like you once had long ago. I'm not an inquisitor. I'm a priest. What difference is there? You've come to destroy us all, as others have tried before that. So many useless words. Just do what you've come for. You stay down there with the cadavers and the dreaded lying souls you so much have cared for all along. Gabriel! Gabriel, are you all right? Gabriel! We'll get you out of there! I had given you up for dead by now. If we had gotten here just five seconds later-- you do realize you were practically saved by a-- Miracle. Call it what you want! You all are supposed to be the experts, no? Virginia, there really are no experts for such happenings. The balance has been broken. And as a result, these forces will never stop battling each other. They've done it under thousands of forms, but in the highest of the heavens, as in the infernal hell. They have always left the choice up to mankind, his own destiny. You speak of tyrants, of wars, of genocides. And of martyrs and all those who have dedicated their lives to others. The history of man is the struggle between good and evil. Because it was decided as such. And so it is. And the Son of God would descend unto the earth, but he would live and die as a man. Evil itself has also walked among men, but never have the heavenly creatures as those of hell come to earth to guide their armies. And I'm sorely afraid that's about to act out. Everything is ready for the sacrifice. The virgin has been prepared. My sisters are waiting for you. The Lord our God in His infinite greatness has seen fit another chosen one to render this moment eternal. And who is the one so fortune? I would be honored, my Lord, but I'm not a virgin. I have born a daughter. Mama. My love. Is it true you're taking me to a beautiful place? The most beautiful of all. No personal egoism will be allowed to become the common good. You need to rest, Father Gabriel. Virginia, God only knows how much I need your help. But this time, let me do this my way. I'm lost, Father. I can't do anything about that. No, I feel the strength, the determination. You're strong. I, on the other hand, have always been weak. The weakness you have also become your strength. How can that be if my heart is so fragile and my body quivers? I gave my body to many men. I let them do what they wanted. And I felt pleasure every time a man offered his sex. And I welcomed it without shame in my mouth, in my womb, wherever he wanted me. And where is your God now? Gabriel. Gabriel! Don't ever do that again. As long as we're together, we are strong. I knew I'd see you again. Can you tell us how we were able to get here, suspended in God knows what dimension? I'm able to do more. I can show you the way back before it gets too late. Your help is precious to us. Great prince of the beasts, the Lord God of all wars, I open the gate of darkness to you. The hour is nigh! Ugh! Gabriel, it appears your fate is as strong as my own. Don't think that by serving a demon would relieve me for the pain of having to brutally kill my disciple. But unfortunately, you have committed a grave useless sacrilege. And now it's my turn to have to pay the price. Rejoice. Do not heed the words of the evil one. Fight against him. I'm so sorry. You must get out of here. No, Mama. You're leaving. I'm staying here. You are pardoned, hoping that your master will do the same. Don't you think that my martyrdom will be like Heaven? Your very purity has made you the chosen one, Sara. The world shall kneel in front of the black pope! Gabriel! I can't feel a pulse. Come on! Come on! Come on, let's go. You're ridiculous. Welcome to slavery, you cock-sucking sinners. It's over. This isn't over. This is just the beginning.
