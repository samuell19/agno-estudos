So how can you can eat so much, Manners, an not gain anyway... Easy, I've been sitting on my fat ass all day like some cops I know. Yeah, well, which cops might that be? Might be half the fucking force you included. Maybe I should just get off my fat ass long enough to clean up the street for your pointy fucking ass. Take it easy, Sloane! If I was in your conditions I'd be the prime candidate for a heart attack. Sure! Unit 12. Calling. Over. This is Unit 12. What have you got? "20 years old white man matching suspect's description." Last seen near, on Jefferson Avenue. Suspect is believed out. Do you copy? Over. We copy, proceeding west on Jefferson. Over. Damn, this could be him. I think we're gonna whack that motherfucker! Damn right! We gonna get that son of a bitch! He raped and slaughtered my sister, Maggie. She's only one out of 200 chicks that motherfucker butchered. There's no fucking way he's getting away this time. No fucking way! We're gonna get him God dammit! You know the only chick he didn't kill, got pregnant? I hope she wise up and burns the little bastard before it's too late. Let's get that motherfucker, come on. Sloane, go round back! Jesus fucking Christ. How many more? Do not even think about it, fuck face! I love pussy. Against the wall. Pussy, soft and warm... Are you okay, Manners? Manners! You fucking shit. You piece of shit! Fucking piece of shit! Manners, are you ok? We have that motherfucker! Are you ok? Son of a bitch! Do you like to rape women? Do you like rape women, you son of a bitch? Motherfucker! Do you like to rape women? Motherfucker? It's okay. Calm down! It's all right! Come on! What's happening to you? - I'm fine. - Sure? Pussy... yeah... Okay, we got him. We got that motherfucker. Come on, Manners, let's take this piece of shit to the station and call it a night. Sick fuck! Take this! One of the chick you raped got pregnant, you son of a bitch! Fuck, Manners what the hell got you? That motherfucker raped your sister, man! We got a job to do! Think about it! - He raped your sister! - We got that motherfucker! Manners! Pussy... Ah that's fucked up. I'm worried about you, Manners. We got to take you to a doctor and check your head out. We go back to the station, Ok? All right. Let's get out of here. Pussy... pussy... You piece of trash! The time of awakening is at hand! Our father Satan has brought forth the power and the wisdom that will lead us to his infernal kingdom. We are the chosen ones. Guide us Lord Satan! So that the blood of the infidels shall forever flow from our grass. Buried beneath us, my children, are the rotten remains of one so foul so eternally evil. That the very presence of this foul creation shall forever redeem us under the shadow of his infernal majesty. Oh hear me Lord Satan great prince of hell and master of eternal night. I invoke thee both by word and operator to rise up before us. By the seventh key of Solomon I set thee free to come. By the power of my faith, I conjure thee to bless us with your holy wisdom and magic. Take this infant born a foul rape. His blood spills to raise the course of its rapist father and by the covenant of the damned shall arise your bidding. Rise! Rise! Arise! Come to us, oh foul one. May your hellish return fuel the fires of our infernal quest. Spirits of the damned drink deep of these foul and fetid fluids to breath new life into your chosen one! Satan I can feel your coming! Oh my God! Get away from me! Oh, shit! Get off! Shit. Oh, shit! Shit. What the fuck is that, man? What the fuck is that? I don't know, man! I thought it was just a shit game, but it worked, man! Let's get the fuck out of here! What the fuck was that about? A fucking scumbag, man. Thinks he can hold out on me! And treat me like an asshole! I'm a fucking cop! Relax, it's just a fucking punk! He's a scumbag! They're all a bunch of fucking scumbags! They don't deserve to fucking live! They should just do the world a favor, man. And should blow their fucking brains out! Manners, you're out of it, man. That fucking head injury, seriously fucked up your brain. The department psychiatrist found nothing is wrong with me! What makes you think there is something wrong? You got a problem, man! It's not right! It's like he's still there! These murdering and raping! Over and over again! And even Maggie. I can't do anything to help her! I know you and your sister were very close. But Logan's dead. I dumped his fucking brain on the floor, remember? He's never gonna rape again. Okay? That's gotta be worth something to you. I guess you're right, I don't know... Look man, of course I'm right. Now let's go find some fucking punk. Maybe you're right. Of course I'm right! - Let's go grab some fucking punks! - Ok. Well we'll do it, we'll do it. Who is it? It's me, man! Open the goddamn door! Got some food, man. We gotta do something, Barney. I can't go on like this. I don't know, man. I don't think we can really do much about it. I been thinking. There's gotta be some way we can stop this thing. We created it, we can kill it. Right? Yes... maybe you're right. I seem to remember something like that. A kind of spell, or something. Something like kind of demon we could summon up to straighten out the mess. Yeah. Yeah, here it is, right here. So it said if something like this goes wrong, there's a demon we can summon to straight the mess out. You mean like, kind of good demonic janitor or something? Exactly. Let's do it! What the hell is this, man? Forgot my cinnamon crispy toes! - What the fuck is wrong with you, man? - Sorry, man. Oh, yeah. You're ready for it, baby? Come on. You thought I had any programs? Are you ready for it? No. Flesh on flesh. - Do you like that? - No... I know you do. Why do you lie to me? Little oxygen restriction? That feel good? It's not supposed to! It's your punishment. Hey guy I have nothing better to do than to stand here and whip you all night, we're gonna get it right. All right. This is the punishment, you little tart. All right, baby. The doctor is ready, open up, say ah. Are you ready to take it this time? You gonna get it. Open wide! Fuck! Oh, Jesus! Fuck! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God! Fuck! Oh, Jesus! No! Oh, my God! Get it out, please! Oh, my God! Get it out of me! Oh, Jesus! Jesus, I cant stand it no more! Oh, my God! Oh, fuck! Shit! Where's the fucking grave? Over there. What the fuck, man! Where is this grave? Let's do this quickly, and get the fuck outta here! Oh hear us Dark Master. Lord of Darkness and ruler of all things unholy. We your faithful servants have gathered over the grave of one that is forsaken you. Oh sweet Satan! Help us to recapture this renegade spirit. So that he may be returned to your service our Lord and ruler for all eternity. Ambus Cerebus and Furnace. Rise demon, rise! Fuck man nothing's happening! I don't get it man. I followed all the steps. Fuck man. It's a bus let's get out of here. I don't get it man. Just fucking go. Right, man. What happened, Manners? Did you make the bust? No, damn it, they didn't show. What do you mean, they didn't show? Did you make the bust? Look man, they didn't show. This is the area, we traced the stock, straight from Colombia. This is it! I'm telling you they did not show. Do you think I'm lying to you? I do not know. That sounds fishy. I mean, what the hell's going on? Something's happened. Hey Sloane, I'm telling you they did not show, all right? Let's go get some donuts. Well, maybe, I guess so... Here station, answer. Over. Here unit 12. Over. Last night, on the east side has been some nasty murder. Over. What it smells like? Over. It seems a double murder inside their house. Unit 12 will be there. Over and out. What the fuck are you doing, Manners? What the hell have you snort? What is that? Nothing man. A cold medicine. Don't worry about it. Cold medicine? Sure! Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. Man, we got to do something about this fucking rapist! The govern is freaking out! Yeah, well this is an election year! Heat's on us to nail this scumbag! Oh my God! My God! Look like someone decided to throw a party. Anybody knows who this dirty boy might be? No, no clues yet. The woman was on the bed, the man was on the floor. And both bodies are mutilated. If I didn't know better, I'd say that's the work of your man Logan. You know Jonas, I think that since you and I are finally alone, I'm ready to do everything you want. - Anything? - Anything you want. How about this? Oh my! What the fuck. You know, I don't need this shit! - I told you I'm not that kind of girl! - Not a big deal! I know plenty of girls who would do that. I don't see the point... - Fine! Go to them! - I will, I will. Jerk. Jerk, I can't believe... Stupid bitch. Fuck her, man! Fuck! I left my wallet. Oh, God! Oh, God! Damn! Fuck you! Jesus, please help us! Send down someone to go through this! An angel, somebody, please! - Help us Lord! Please get down Jesus, help us! - Please forgive us, Jesus. - Barney made me do it, right? What do you mean 'I made you do it'? It was your idea to join the sect! And you say it to Jesus, man?! I can't lie to Jesus! What was that? - Please, forgive us! - Oh Jesus, forgive us! Go check it out, man. Fuck you, Jack! Fuck this! Get the fuck out of here. Where the fuck you think you're going? Man, I don't care! I'm not gonna wait around this joint, waiting for something evil to come take our asses! Oh, no! Oh my God! Oh my God! Hi, guys! Thank you! Where the fuck is that motherfucker? Shit. Where you been? You got something for me? Where the hell you been, man? I been here all morning. Stop this shit, man! Do you have something for me? Yeah I have something for you, right here. Give it to me. It's not the same shit... So, shit like this, I got it straight, you know? Just we got this, you know... It's perfect. Yes! - Yes! It's a good shit! - I told you! - Very Good! - I told her it was great. Yes, you know, I do you a favor, you do me a favor. - What you say? - Yeah, I'm going to do you a favor, man. So, what you come up with, Manners? Not much, there's nothing around but some small potatoes who certainly don't worth our time. We catch the big one and they got his head up his ass. Fuck! I thought we were onto something for sure last time! We were on to shit. This is total useless ground. Maybe we should hang around a little longer, just in case. In case of what? In case something turns up! Nothing's gonna fucking turn up, all right? Can't stay here jerking ourselves on this. - You should do something about that cold, Manners. - Yes. Oh, it looks like we got a live one. You all right, buddy? Lt... it's a demon. It's a horrible demon! A demon? Are you on drugs? No, man. It's a demon, man! - You are on drugs, don't you? - No man, I'm not on drugs, man! - Cocaine? - No, no, man! - What you got? You got crack? - No man! Wait a minute! You got blow? None of that, it's a demon, man! A rapist! - You holding out on me? - No, man! - You cheap ass punk, you hold it out on me? - No, no, man! We got a demon... we need to do something, man! What you got, man? Show me! I'm telling you! Don't be holding out on me! Fucking trash! Fucking trash! I fucking kill you, man! Die! - What the hell is going on, Manners? - Uh? What have you done?! This doped maniac was mumbling about demons. He started smashing his head on the rock! He just started smashing his head on the rock! I think he was on pcp, or something. Couldn't you do something about it? Couldn't you stop him? Are you calling me a liar? Oh, no... but it's not the right... You got admit this thing is really strange, Manners. Strange! You gonna back me up, right? Well... you're my partner, of course I'll back you up. But I can not guarantee that perhaps this is gonna be suspicious. Fuck those assholes, man! You saw what happened! Come on! - Come on, let's go get some tacos. - Ok, Ok... All right! Come on! This is detective Sloane, Seattle, unit 12. I have reason to believe that my partner detective Manners has become psychologically unbalanced and possibly no longer able to perform his duties as a police officer. Due to an injury Manners received on the job, several months ago, his judgment and possibly even his sanity have become greatly impaired. I believe Manners to be a danger to the community. And possibly even a threat to himself. Do you want it here? You want it here? Don't you want it here? I brought you a little playmate. Bye bye! Do you like that? I like it too. Bad girls must be punished. Hey! Where do you go? Gonna make you stop it. All these fucking scumbags! This town's full of scumbags! Pushers, pimps, gangbanging faggots! They don't deserve to live! Somebody with enough balls ought to come along and just wipe that filth right off the streets. Fags, hippies, scummy hippies! I think we should just toss our badges aside. Blow their fucking heads out! Scummy hippies! What do you think, Sloane? Let's just wipe out all that fucking trash in this shithole town. We'll be doing 'em a favor. I do not know, Manners. Just ain't gonna be that fucking easy. Unit 12 please respond. Over. Unit 12, Sloane. Over. You guys are not gonna believe this. We got the DNA from the last night rape. And it perfectly matches with your old friend Logan's. What do you mean? How's that? Unit 12. According to the description your friend Logan committed the rape the other night. You copy? Over. I copy. But it can't be, Frank. Just telling you what we know. Over. Somebody's gotta be fucking with... What the fuck are you doing, Manners? Are you fucking gone insane? You gone crazy? It's a cold medicine. Don't worry about it. Medicine my ass, you're fucking insane! - Hey man, it's a cold medicine. - This must be a fucking nightmare! Don't worry about it, man... You've fucking lost your mind! What the fuck, son of a bitch. What the hell? Manners! Manners, something fucking weird is going on. You gotta back me up. Manners! Shit! Fucking freak. I'll back you, man... Hey, suck it! Suck it! Oh my God! Oh my God! I don't know how you came back. But there's no way you're getting away. This time you're going down for good! This time you're going definitely down you motherfucker! Take this, you motherfucker! This is for my sister Maggie! You motherfucker! Oh God, I'm glad you're here, Manners. Seems like I missed a bloodbath. What the hell happened here? - The body over there... our friend Logan. - What are you saying? He's our friend? No! I'm saying that that's Logan! He came back from the darkness of hell! What are you saying, man? What are you talking about? It's ridiculous! I'm saying, that he's some kind of demon, or something! A demon? What, are you on drugs? No, no! It's some kind of fucking zombie! Zombie? What are you saying? You fucking punk, huh? No, no, I'm saying he's a zombie, he came out of his grave! What are you talking about? Are you holding out on me? Get out! Get out you fucking punk! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucking punk! Yeah! You punk! Fucking scumbag! Fuck you scum, man! Fuck that! Fuck.
