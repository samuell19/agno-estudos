And this decision should be taken in the meeting day after tomorrow. So, is this alright? You are next. -Of course I am senior. And who else? -Now you see, If not anything... And some will defect from the opposition. - Yes. Brother, Sunita is becoming the CM. What nonsense are you speaking? Sunita is becoming the CM? That girl, who doesn't know ABCD of Politics will become the CM? Have they gone mad? The whole region will be destroyed. -Exactly! I think this suggestion is Sanjay's, her brother. He's a smart man! But this Mr. Joshi is a fair man. We'll see to it that she doesn't become. -Okay! Again the same thing. Understand that there is no use... Sanju i've told you that i've no interest in politics. Please finish this subject here. Great. This is the right decision. The opposition people will be really happy. Even you are his son. Why don't you become the CM? I am talking to my sister. -Do you have any problem? Get lost! Sunita what I want to say is... I cannot become the CM You know how close I was to daddy is politics. They are jealous of me the same way they were jealous of daddy. Your case if different. You are a girl. In the coming elections we can gather sympathy votes on for you. And the most important thing is.. ..they think you are illiterate and simple and will accept you easily. And you already know about my health! Firstly, I will want to tell you'll.. ..that party has selected their new Minister unanimity. Our Chief Minister Late Mr. Jagdish Acharya's daughter.. ..Ms. Sunita Acharya. The Party has announced their decision. But the real decision will be the taken by the people. After 2 months in the elections. But I will not let the ideologies and the principle die. For which my father lived and died for. I am not only answerable towards my party and my region.. ..but also towards my Country. Sunita... Sunita... Sunita... Sunita wake up. Please get up Sunita.

I want to know for my satisfaction. Answer me in Yes or No. No! No! No... Thanks! Thank you very much. You got him the bail, now you only take care of this case. It's a serious case. Raghu will handle it. It is a serious case, but also it is safe. Everything is in your favour. And the most important thing. Sanju is innocent. He's got a strong alibi. And Jaggu this whole case is a lie. This is a political trap. Exposing will be easy. Nothing will happen. Sanju I told you, Jaggu will fight your case. What is the guarantee, of Jaggu winning? We want a good lawyer. A good lawyer is the one who is smart. The one who is brilliant. The one who understands our pain. No one can understand our pain more than Jaggu. And we also have Brother Raghu with us. To save you, he'll put in all efforts. Trust him. Jaggu... You don't have to worry. I am there with you. Come on brother we are getting late for the court. Inspector Rane... Did you file Ms. Parvati Shastri's FIR? Yes. Did she come alone to the police station? No there was an old man who accompanied her. Who was this old man? Parvati Shastri's father, grandpa, uncle or someone else? He wasn't her relative. He was a reporter and he did that as a part of his duty. Did you refuse to file the FIR first? Yes. Why? My Lord, first of all... The girl's cloths weren't torn. And nor did she have any marks or bruises on her body. Doesn't look like she's been tortured. Because My Lord... When a girl is raped.. ..she shouts, she cries. But this girl wasn't shouting nor was she yelling. And what else? Apart from this My Lord... The man, this girl had blamed.. ..the social status is high. He is well reputed in the society. Where as the social status of this girl is low. Very common. Who forced you to file the FIR, Parvati Shastri or reporter? No, it was done by the reporter himself. And My Lord.. He also threatened me. That's all your honour. Thank you inspector. His name is Mr. Vidyarthi right? -Yes. For how long are you working with this newspaper Mr. Vidyarthi? -Almost from past 16 years. Is this true that your newspaper.. ..is against, Ms. Sunita Acharya becoming the Chief Minister? Yes. We are against the dynasty rule. The King's ruling period is gone. Where their coming generations were made to sit on the throne. And all the power was captured in one home. There is Democracy today. And decentralization is important for democracy. That is why we do not want.. ..Sunita Acharya to become the Chief Minister of the nation. This conflict can also be against Sanjay Acharya. Without doubts. But what exactly are you trying to say? What I am trying to say is, if Sanjay Achraya's name is involved in any scandal.. ..his sister's pride will be ruined. And she will be thrown out of the race of becoming the Chief Minister. And this is a great news to the opposition and.. ..and to your newspaper who are related to them. And to fulfil this purpose you needed a girl. Who, for some amount will not even bother about her respect.. ..and will blame Sanjay Acharya for a dirty crime. And you got that girl easily. This is a lie. -Thank you Mr. Vidyarthi, you can go. Your Honour! I would like to call Dr. Pandit. Dr. Pandit... Did you do Parvati Shastri's medical check up? -Yes. Was she raped? She had a sexual relations. But to identify whether it was a rape is difficult. What is special about this case? Almost in all the rape cases there are signs of struggle.. Means signs of a forceful effort to resist attack. So did Parvati Shastri had such marks on her body? -No! There weren't. So from this you can say there was no rape? So the sexual relations were by her consent? Well, there are possibilities. Did you get Parvati Shastri's blood test done? Yes of course. Was there particular thing about it? There were small traces of alcohol in the blood. Means Liquor? Yes, liquor. That's all Your Honour! Thank you Doctor. Your Honour, I would like to call Parvati Shastri's father. What is your name? -Shankar Vasudev Shastri Are you Parvati's Father? Yes I am. How do you earn your living? My daughter takes tuitions for singing and dance. The house expenses run on that. Does your daughter take tuitions at home or outside? I couldn't hear sorry. Does your daughter take tuitions at home or outside? 2-3 girls come home for tuitions. And for few she used to go to their house. What time she used to go and come back? For the tuitions outside, she used to leave in the evenings And used to return late at night. Who are the students? Where Do they stay? Do you know? No... Mean when she leaves the house.. ..who she meets, what she does, what is the relation... You don't know anything about it? No... But what do you want to say? Thank you Your Honour. Thank you, that's all. Your Honour, I would like to call that girl and ask her few questions. Ms. Parvati Shastri... What ever I say will be nothing, except the truth. Ms. Parvati Shastri... Why did you lie to your father? That you give tuitions to children? Whereas your actual work is entertaining the men. And dance in front of rich people. And in all these men, there is this one man, Who has a police record. Who has been arrested, 3 times in Delhi and 2 times in Mumbai. In a call girl racket. The name of this man is Kamal Chaddha. She's opened a dance school just for name sake, which actually is not. This is a prostitution spot. You go there thrice a week and stay there all night. Yes or No? Yes or No? This is your Father's medical report. Which is dated exactly 5 days before your FIR. According to this report, your father's both the kidneys have failed. And to save him and save his life, dialysis was needed. And dialysis is an expensive treatment. Which cannot be afforded by a poor girl like you. But still you managed to give 20 thousand in the hospital. I want to know, From where did that money come? Who gave it to you? And why? And yes... If you are raped, and there are no marks on your body. Why? You didn't resist? I want to know. Why didn't you try to save your self? After meeting Sanjay Acharya, when she was returning home with Geeta In the middle, she got down saying she was to meet some one. I want to know who did she meet? Why? Why did you want to meet, and whom? I'll tell you Your Honour! She went to meet journalist Vidyarthi. Who wants to defame my client. Want to finish them politically. Finish them absolutely. He tried to bribe her and she agreed on helping him. Both had a drink together. Had sex together And then went to the police station to act upon their idea. I do not want to say anything else apart from this. That is do not trust this girl at all. This girl is Characterless She is a slut She is a prostitute And her accusation is not true, it is baseless, And my client Sanjay Acharya is not guilty. That is why I am requesting you to dismiss this case as soon as possible. And release Sanjay Acharya. That's all your honour. Thank you. This court declares Mr. Sanjay Acharya not guilty. And Ms. the court warns you, If again you happen to blame a respected citizen like this... You will not be forgiven. And further the court also warns you, to keep your behaviour right. So the precious time of the court doesn't waste. The case is dismissed. Cheers! Come on! Ya... I was just thinking about you. If you keep fighting the case in this way.. ..our company can will be successful. We can touch the sky. We'll touch the skies Jaggu. And you will become the leading lawyer of this city. Wow! I am proud of you my friend. Have... Cheers! Cheers! -Wait, what? Innocent until proven guilty. You've got to believe me. Ya, but Indian legal system is.. ..still better than most of the system in the world. Jaggu... -Ya? Jaggu I want to talk to you. -Yes. Yes... -Jaggu I want to talk. One has to... -Jaggu. Jaggu... I am having some legal talks. -The law cannot do anything to me. What happened? What is it? What is the matter? Are you drunk too much? Jaggu, my brother-in-law, you take care of me so much. Thanks. If you are with me, I can pick up any girl whenever I want. What is the matter? What are you talking? What are you talking about? She was one dumb women, went straight to the police station. Who are you talking about? The more naive and innocent the girl is, the better she is. Are you talking about Parvati? I feel like getting that girl again. Are you talking about Parvati? Don't tell Sunita, I am talking about Parvati only. There is a limit to arrogance. Jaggu, you have crossed all barriers. You bought us both down to shame, amidst so many people. I am ashamed of you. And you should be ashamed too. Be thankful that I didn't kill him. I would have killed him bhai. Shut up! -No, brother you listen to me. Jaggu! -Please brother, please. Please! I am not wrong. I told you that the girl is telling the truth. She was saying the Truth. She was raped. Who did that? -Sanjay! How do you know? He told me by himself, brother. How is this possible? This is what has happened. He's confessed by himself, brother, by himself. Even if he is guilty, what can be done? The court has found him not guilty and have released him. And you defended him Jaggu... -That's what I regret brother. Why did I defend him? Why did I start my career with a lie? Where are you going? -To search that girl, to apologise. To apologise? -I defamed her in the court. In the same way Duryodhan did to Draupadi in a court filling with people. But I am not like that. I am not like him. Greetings. Is Parvati at home? Recently, Paro had got engaged to Bhaskar. Bhaskar, Krushan's son. Paro was very happy with Bhaskar. But some black shadow caught my daughter. After that, even Bhaskar turned his face. He left Paro. Krishnan refused to even see Paro's tears. This ruined all my daughter's dreams. What life does she have and for whom? I do now have a lot of days left. Once I meet Paro, I'll breath my last breath that day. Where are you gone my child? Where have you gone? Did you get any news about that girl? Not yet? I don't understand where she must have gone I tried to find out everywhere, sir. But no clue about her. If you don't mind can I give you an opinion sir? You please don't reopen the case. There are well known people involved. So it'll be better if you keep yourself away from that girl. Or anything can happen. Sir I had already told you before. That there are 20-25 men, 3-4 kids and 3 old ladies. There is no young girl here. Listen... I am a prostitute. I am a prostitute. I am a prostitute. Come do what you want. You aren't upset right? I am ready to do everything. I am ready to do what you say. I am hungry. I am hungry. I am really very hungry... You name it, I'll do it. This is my work. Paro... Sir? -Ya? Did you ask for a doctor? -Yes, I had asked. When will he come? -He's on the way. Sooner the better. Are you Jaggu's assistant or a napkin? You do not know where did Jaggu even go? I am telling you the truth ma'am, he didn't tell me anything. Not only me, he didn't even tell his brother Jaggu. He only left a note saying.. "I am going out on a mission. Will call once I reach". But I didn't get any call. -Excuse me, madam... Khanna sir is calling Sanjay sir. Come... Khanna sir... -Yes! Did Raghu... - No, you forbidden me. Good! Where is Jaggu? I do not know. I want Jaggu. -I absolutely don't know. Maybe he calls Jaggu, in the office. Is it? -Just keep a check. Is he in this city or not? I do not know. -Find out. Try to find out. I want Jaggu's information any how. Keep this. There was no need for this. -Keep it. I want Jaggu's information. -I'll try my best. Sleep... I said sleep. Sleep!! I said sleep. Go to sleep. Paro... What is happening? Paro! What's happening Paro? Stop it. Stop it Paro! Sleep... -Stop it! "This girl is characterless, a slut, a prostitute" "Her blame is a lie" -Paro please Paro... Paro... "And my client Sanjay Acharya is innocent and guiltless" Paro control yourself, Paro! Please! Paro... Paro... "The in-law's left, so did the neighbours" "That innocent girl forgot everything" "That innocent girl forgot everything" "She's cried her way through" "She's cried her way through" "She's cried her way through" "She's cried her way through" "Through all her life" "What can one do with broken wings?" "What can one do with broken wings?" "The suffocation has killed this daughter" This behaviour is because of the situations she's been through. And because of this sometimes... And because of this, she gets these incidents in her mind, Or always, these thoughts, upsets her. Nurse take her. And there's nothing to be worried about. She'll be alright slowly. But take care of one thing. There is a suicidal tendency in people like these. And this can we very dangerous. So you please take good care of her and be shrewd. Strange! What happen? What you doing? What? What are you up to? Come walk ahead. God! What is happening Paro? What are you doing? Paro?? What is in your leg? What did you put in there? Come on remove your shoes. Sit down. What did you do? Cigarette? Are you mad? "I am happy today, you tell me why" "I am happy today, you tell me why" "Come on, tell me soon" "You are happy because we are walking together" "Tell me isn't this the reason?" "Wow! Now give a high five" "Because what you have said is so true". "My earring keep kissing my cheeks" "Tell me why does it kiss me like that?" "The way you dance, they dance the same way" "Listen, they dance along" "Wow! Now give a high five" "Because what you have said is so true" "I can see the world up-side down." "Why can I see it like that?" "You are simple, so you can see it that way" "Wow! Now give a high five" "Because what you have said is so true". "I am happy today, you tell me why" "Come on, tell me soon" "You are happy because we are walking together" "Tell me isn't this the reason?" "Wow!

Absolutely... This is the speech my father was suppose to deliver before his death. In this, those 10 formulated programmes are present.. ..on the bases of which he wanted to win fight the elections. We will follow this. Total prohibition? My God! This is a very radicle manifest Sunita ma'am. If we follow this as it is then... -It'll be good for the public. That's what my father wanted. And if I want to take any opinion, I'll take it from my dad. Not from you'll. if I am selected as a leader, I'll do what my father wanted to do. Because I am his daughter. Did you understand that? Okay Ms. Sunita... As you say... -So Mr. Bharat so you start. And learn these formulas by heart. -Okay, greetings. Sunita, Jaggu here. -Where have you been? In Mount Rose. -I am really missing you, Jaggu. Me too. I trust you completely Jaggu. But what you did to Sanju, that night in the party.. ..I did not like that. Sanjay is a rapist Sunita. What are you talking? He has raped Paro. I am even more bygone that he is. I have defamed her in front of the whole court. Till I don't return her lost dignity, I won't be at peace. But there are chances, that girl is making you a fool. Sanjay, has done this Sunita. He's told me by himself. If you do not believe me, why don't you ask your brother? Yes brother I'll talk to Sunita. No she's a girl, so she gets carried away in emotions so... No, I'll make her understand. Don't worry. I'll talk to you later. Yes.. yes, I'll call you. What is it? Did you rape Parvati? Sunita, I was talking to Mr. Bharat. Sanjay, I asked you, whether you raped Parvati? Did you rape Parvati? -What happening, Sunita? Do not laugh. Answer me? Get up!

I will get him back. Paro? Paro? Paro... Paro... Paro... Paro... Paro... Paro... Paro... -Will you have more milk? Where had you disappeared? I was irritated searching for you.

"We'll get lost in each other" "I'll hide myself in your eyes" "And you get lost in my breath" "Now you stay quite for a while" "If you want, get lost in the sleep" "I'll only fall asleep when you make some love" "Only when I hold you close, I'll find some peace" "Don't loose your mind and trouble me like that" "Listen to me when I say stay away from me" "Look at my anxiety and understand my situation" "Now only God can understand you" "Why are we sitting quite?" "We'll get lost in each other" "Why quite?" [Musical notes playing] "Come and get lost in me" "Hold me in this way, that I loose all my sense" "What madness is this? Why are you harassing me?"

"Stop saying all this, stop distracting like that" "I'll hide myself in your eyes" "And you get lost in my breath" "Now you stay quite for a while" "If you want, get lost in the sleep" Darkness isn't for ever. There is light after that. And I told you, you are absolutely alright now. And your lost memory has also come back. And all this has happened, because of Jaggu sir's attempts. Sugar? -1 tea spoon. This is enough. I... I... how long was i here? Maybe past 28 days. And where is he? Jaggu sir? -Yes? To meet your in laws. No, we cannot accept Parvati as our daughter-in-law. She's been raped. She's been defamed in the whole world. And you want us to... -Why are you arguing? Even if God came down to say this.. ..we'd never accept her as our daughter-in-law. We have a status in the society. Come on, why are you'll standing? Come on! He thinks, only Parvati is left to marry my Bhaskar. Bhaskar... What is your decision? What ever my family decides. Thank you. They denied right? -Yes they denied. I knew it. And what they did was right. It was right. Why would respected people.. ..want a disgraced girl as their daughter-in-law? When Bhaskar will look at me, he won't see me as a bride, but as a raped female. How will he be happy? His decision is right. I... It's my part... Leave it on me. You fought how much you could. You did how much you could. You're a nice person. Only because there are people like you, this world is going on. Or... All will be alright. All will be fine. -All will be fine. -It will be. I take an oath... -"I, Sunita Acharya..." That towards the Indian Constitution -"That towards the Indian Constitution" -"I will keep, faith and trust". I will keep all the growth... -"I will keep all the growth..." And unity in India intact. -"And unity in India intact". "I, Bharat Tikam Tiwari..." I take an oath, -"I take an oath," "I will keep all the growth..." And unity in India intact. -"And unity in India intact". "And as the Chief Minister of the Maharashtra province..." "I will maintain the liabilities..." -"Will do it with trust and good sense" -"And according to the rules..." -Sanjay Acharya... Parvati Shastri, come out. Sir you come with me. You can sit here, and talk to her. I did what I wanted to do. Now I request you, for me can you plead for me to be hanged and not life imprisonment. For me life and trust do not matter any more. This Paro is over. Maybe some other Paro, comes to your court. So keep a check lawyer sir. Do not kill a dead poor. Please don't kill. "The in-law's left, so did the neighbours" "That innocent girl forgot everything" "That innocent girl forgot everything" "She's cried her way through" "She's cried her way through" "She's cried her way through" "She's cried her way through" "Through all her life" "What can one do with broken wings?" "What can one do with broken wings?" "The suffocation has killed this daughter" "The suffocation has killed this daughter" Sir... Please save my daughter. I'll try. I'll try. Nonsense, this is absolute nonsense. The girl who killed Sanjay in public.. you will fight her case to save her? You had told me once. "The lawyer to saved the criminal in the court, is the real lawyer". But how is this wrong Jaggu? Our name will be degraded. And what about the company's name? And money? -How much money? Tell me. I am telling you, let this case be. Mr. Kanti Desai is ready to give, 20 lakhs for this case. Take up his case. If not, we'll ask for 50 lakhs. Look this is our aim, "Raghu Jaggu and associates". We should be in league with, "Batliwala and company". I want this plate in gold, that's all i want. Screw this office and screw this name plate. You'll build this office on the dead bodies of noble people? You will defend killers like Mr. Kanti and predators like Sanjay? This kind of advocacy can be done by you, not by me. I can't kill my conscience and work, do you understand? Jaggu... Jaggu... Our client is like God to us. But advocacy is our occupation. Didn't you learn that yet? I have learn, responsibility and conscience comes before client. If the people who fight for justice, start doing injustice.. ..what will be the state of this country? What will happen to the poor who, comes to us for justice? They make us their voice in the court.. ..to prove themselves not guilty. What if they come to know? The people who give us justice, are become greedy. They have become selfish. Have become dishonest. What will happen then? There will be a civil war. Do you understand? The troubled poor will flow like and river and come to us with Flambeau. They'll burn down our mother and daughters, and we'll stand there watching. What are you gong to do next? Then what justice are you going to do? Practise or live without a conscience? And yes, I will be defending Paro in the court. And this is my final decision. So listen to my decision as well. I will take up Sanjay's case. And I want to see.. ..how do your ideologies save you. And remember... We are not brothers in the court. We are enemies. What is this? This is the truth. Are you going to celebrate his death in the court. And you'll say he was a rapist? And he was defamed? This is also true. And you'll be a defence council to the girl who killed my brother? Even this is true. Sunita, there's no one for that innocent girl. Who is that girl I know very well. If you wanna know the truth, ask me. The truth is, that girl has taken a place in your heart. The truth is, in the name of cure she was taken to the mountains.. ..and singing around everywhere. The truth is, you were dancing with her in bed. The truth is, you've touched her... You should be ashamed. Mr. Jaggu Sinha... You will have to pay for this slap. You'll be slapped in front of the public. You'll be slapped in front of the whole court. In front of each and every lawyer. -Sunita... Don't you dare call me Sunita. You are talking to the CM. Jaggu Sinha, now wait to see yourself and that girl destroy. It's an open and shut case your honour. All the situations are so well known. That nor I need to give any speech on criminal Parvati Shastri, Nor the defence has any way to prove that she's not guilty. There is Your Honour! I will prove that criminal Parvati Shastri.. ..before becoming normal, was suffering a disorder. Which wasn't physical but mental, related to brain. She was filled with madness. And may be what she did, was in ambiguity. To my witness, I want call upon Dr. Aiteshaan, your honour. Permission granted. Dr. Aiteshaan... When you saw the criminal the 1st time, what was her mental state? It was bad and fragile. She was drained in a very bad state of Schizophrenia. Because of which she used to get mental attacks. This was a prey to a sick dream. Dream? What dream? She used to think of herself like a cheapish and slutty. Cheapish and slutty? Means a prostitute. Isn't it? Yes. That is why I am sure, she went through something bad. For which her state today is so bad and fragile. Means medically saying she was mad, insane, crazy? Objection Your Honour. Defence council is again asking rubbish questions. During the murder, criminal Parvati Shastri was completely in her senses. She entering the oath ceremony with a gun in spite of high security being present. And shooting 6 bullets with so much confidence and satisfactorily, proves that all this was well planned. And was well planned. And to do all of this we need a balanced mind your honour. Which Parvati Shastri had. Is Vishnu sir home, the Chief Minister is come to see him. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings! You have come to our house, we are lucky. Can you tell me how long do you know Parvati Shastri? From ages. Was her character bad since childhood? What? Is that why you'll left her? During the oath taking ceremony of the new Chief Minister, There were dozens of people present. All the news channels were covering this ceremony. Everyone have seen, That criminal Parvati Shastri got up from her her chair.. ..and she shouted Sanjay Acharya's name. This time... -Excuse me! Your honour., with your permission.. ..I would like to show the video cassette of that incident. -Permission granted. "And according to the rules..." "Sanjay Acharya!" Your Honour, Parvati Shastri has killed. You have seen it on TV. The whole world has seen. Our issue here is not about what has happened with Parvati Shastri. Our issue is, what has Parvati Shastri done? Murder? That is why, I request the court, To charge criminal Parvati Shastri, Indian Penal Code section 302.. That's all your honour. All are putting allegations on you'll.. ..that you'll have left a helpless girl as she was accused. So what can we do? If you help me... Look, we're very poor in front of you. I'll rid you of of your poverty. - What? How much money do you want? You'll get as much as you want. Accused Parvati Shastri, did you kill Sanjay Acharya or not? I have killed Sanjay Acharya. Have you murdered him purposely knowing it? Yes! Why? Because he raped me. But the court's decision was, Sanjay Acharya did not rape. Court's decision was wrong. Oh! So to rectify the court's decision.. ..you took the law in your hands. And shot Sanjay dead? Isn't it? -Yes! Accused Parvati Shastri... Do you know this statement can get you a death penalty? Yes, I know. But some people die after being hanged.. ..and some before. I do not need anyone's pity. You tell us your decision. I was hanged long back. When a strong man... Took away my innocence, my teenage with a slap. I was hanged when... My in-laws didn't pay attention to my tears and rejected me. I was hanged when... Your lawyer, amidst the court called me a prostitute and slut. What else is left? What else is there? Then why this show? Why do you call and humiliate me everyday? What is this act? Everybody does know I have murdered. And why have I done it. Why this arguments and debates? And these lawyers. Every lawyer wants to be more successful that the other. And you? You also want to show your power sitting on that throne. You can hang anyone to death and save anyone? Control your language madam. I have only one plea judge sir... Don't humiliate me more. Already many people have insulted me. A lady will prefer dying over getting humiliated. Enough! Enough of this. I do not want justice, I want death. I want death. The next hearing will be on Monday. Till then we will not declare our decision. Till then the court is adjourned. I used to love Parvati then and I still love her. But you rejected her after she got raped. No, I didn't. My family forced me. And your lawyer friend came here too. What's his name? -Jaggu Sinha? Yes, Jaggu Sinha! What did he say? "And according to the rules..." "Sanjay Acharya" Sir, this is Sanjay sir's medical report. He had a bad habit of drinking. -I know! Sir, I do not see any chances of us winning in this case. - I know! We have to fight this case, till we don't loose. Keep Sanjay's family doctor ready, to appear in the court. Order! Order! Before the court gives out their decision, The court wants to know from the prosecutor and the defence.. ..do they want to say anything for the last time? Yes, your honour.! I would like to request the court to allow me another witness. One more witness? This is rubbish! Your honour, this is going to be a waste of everyone's precious time. This is for the sake of an innocent life. Your honour, this is... In the name of justice, give me another chance to present another witness. Permission granted. Thank you your Honour. My last witness is... Family doctor of the Acharya's, Dr. Poddar. Dr. Poddar... How long have you known the Acharya family? I know them from many years. That means... You might be knowing all the health secrets of the Acharya family. Who had what illness? Objection your honour! What kind of a question is this? Defence has no right to ask the anyone personal questions. Dr. Poddar... You have all the rights to deny anything.. ..that is against your profession. That is your privilege. Now you can continue. Have you ever been to foreign with Sanjay? Have you ever been to foreign with Sanjay? Sorry, I cannot answer this question. -Why not? This is a very simple, harmless question. Objection your honour! The defence cannot force someone to answer. It's not in the line. -It is in the line, your honour. Thing that has been entered in his passport and visa.. ..what is the harm in accepting it here? But this question is very irrelevant. But this question is relevant for this case, your honour. Must be, but you have no right to waste the court's time. You have no right. -Order! Order! No personalities please. I warn both of you. Objection over-ruled! Thank you your honour! Come I'll help you Dr. Poddar. This is a report of one of the city hospitals. According to which... Sanjay had got a severe heart attack 2 months back. Because of drugs his whole nervous system was damaged. Even a slightest shock would have been fatal for him. That is why, always having a doctor around was necessary. Yes or no? That's right. Is it why, Along with your medical bag.. ..you were seated at the swearing ceremony beside Sanjay? Because you never know when he needs help. -Yes, he was critical. When Sanjay saw the accused and heard her... What was his reaction then? That shock was fatal. Sanjay's heart had failed and he was about to fall. I request the court... Let me play the video clipping for this incident. Which proves that Parvati Shastri is not guilty. She has just fired bullets, not murdered. Permission granted. Your honour! During the incident, Everyone saw, Parvati Shastri shooting 6 bullets on.. ..Sanjay Acharya, who was standing on the stage. But how did Sanjay Acharya died no one paid attention to that. We'll check this from the other side of the camera. "Will do it with trust and good sense" "Sanjay Acharya..." After hearing her voice, he was shocked. But Parvati's first bullet didn't hurt him. Not even the second bullet. He started getting a heart attack. Look at this third bullet. This is the fourth. This was the fifth. Sanjay's heart failed. Sanjay fell, and them Parvati shot the 6th bullet. But Sanjay was dead till then. Means Parvati's 6th bullet hit Sanjay's dead body your honour. Your honour, Law and nature have 1 rule... You cannot kill the dead. That's all your honour. She'll be saved. What a great point! Accused Parvati Shastri, after hearing all the witnesses and evidences.. ..this bench is come to this conclusion, That accused Parvati Shastri, Keeping a gun without license, according to the arms act, Ruining the peace by shooting, And also for trying to kill engaged Sanjay Acharya, Will me given 3 months of imprisonment. But, Sanjay Acharya's death took place because of a heart attack. After this has been proved.. ..accused Parvati Shastri is found not guilty of murder. Sir... Sir... May god give all my blessings to you. Thank you so much. No, Paro! I am not worth any thank you. I am not happy at all, Paro. I have taken you out from the courts issues.. ..but the life issues you're going through, Who will take you out from that? There is someone called God, he will take her out sir. He will take her out. -No, there is no God. God is nowhere. -God is there, Jaggu sir. He is there. Doctor? What are you looking at me sir? Look here. "Symbols of love are given" "Symbols of love..." "Symbols of love..." Will you be able to forgive me, Paro? "Symbols of love..." "Symbols of love..."
