Just stop there. What gave you the impression, that you could walk into my house and touch my things. Isn't it obvious, I just wanted to do something nice for you. Hmm. Let me do some thing nice for you. Leave. - Bono, have I done...? - Get out. Hey, go and drop that where you carried it from. What? So Third man in five… days. Hmm, not a record year, - but you're getting there. - Not funny. Hmm. I think… I need to start making note of the type of men as well. That come because, this last one definitely gets extra points. - Ah, hm, for buffness. - Can you just let me be. Kore, like let me be. - But see, I just want to know, - Hmm. What are the side benefits of man helping you? - Huh? - For somebody that has it down to a tee, you are not coming forth with masterclasses. - I want to learn, please. - Kore? - Hmm? - Let me be. - Ah! - But seriously, why do you feel the need to have sex with them and toss them out? Even the ones that like you. Big deal. You're stressing me out, - leave me alone. - Especially - the ones that like you. - Kore, you're… I just woke up. - I just woke up. I'm tired. Yes. - Hmm. We all just woke up. We heard. Please are we expecting… - anybody today? Sorry. - Please, leave me alone. My team and I have definitely covered all the loop holes that you might face going down the social media route but I must buffer, in the US alone, influencers account for over 30 billion dollars of income for brands who have chosen to go down this route. If you look at the spreadsheet that I've in front of you, you will see that you can reach your niche market in the first 48 hours of the app launching. There are three main risks that we face going down this route. Firstly, putting all your eggs in one basket. Namely using me as a brand. However, my one basket, supplies brand options and lifestyle options to over five million other brands. Your futuristic idea of digital payment plan is instantly met with three million other marketers at the price of one. And in turn, this three million, feed an extra 200 baskets. Come on, even if we're being conservative, the laws of geometric progression will cover the rest. And in my opinion, you will be reaching your niche market asap, wouldn't you say that? Um, how does this become more than just a clickbait? Remember, they have to use the app for at least two consecutive months. Guys, come on. In the spirit of intellectual property law, I cannot divulge all that information when we haven't even signed anything. In fact, the ink doesn't have to dry But in the meantime, ladies and gentlemen, if you will allow me, I would like to introduce you guys, the new Bonofide clan. Well, thank you very much, Bono, for your passionate and very well-detailed… - uh, presentation… - Thank you. I'd like to say also your team has done greatly well too. Um, at this point, I will like my partner here to give his feedback. - I approve. - Fantastic. So when do we start? Well, I should think we are pretty much closer to 70% on signing on paper. So we will need to wait and get feedback from our silent partner, and major investor. Um, oh, who is that? He prefers to remain anonymous. That is fine. No problem. So, would you at least let me know when we would start? - Sure, definitely. - Cool. Bono! Bono? That was good, you are good. Thank you, and thank you for your time. So was that what last time was all about? Excuse me? I just need help understanding why you did what you did. Let me get something straight. Did you think that last night was a nod for this morning? Did my proposal look like it needed any bed-related approval? Wow, slow down. I just needed help understanding why you did what you did this morning. It's simple. We met, we talked, I wanted you, I had you. Period. So, it doesn't matter if I like you? Does it? Look, I already told you. I don't do long-term. And I'm 100% sure I made it clear. Look, you could tell me the real reason, say, over dinner. Look, I refuse to believe it's just a sex thing. That's just a man's move. Not in my world. In my world, men don't have the prerogative to initiate. I hope you've been schooled today. And I think I've said too much. Frankly. ♪ I'm a boss ♪ ♪ Boss boss ♪ ♪ Boss baby I'm a boss boss ♪ ♪ Boss calling all the shots shots shots ♪ ♪ Baby I'm a boss ♪ - ♪ Boss ♪ - ♪ You know I'm a boss ♪ ♪ You know ♪ - Good day members of the press. - Good day, Miss Bono. And everyone else gathered here today. My name is Bono Siaba Kuku and I am the head of the TruMoney Bonofide clan. This is a family of people who are very diverse. Yet, very connected. And what connects us? A singular vision. A vision to grow funds while spending as conservatively as possible. - Hello ma, how do you… - I'll… I'll take questions later, please. Thank you. In the TruMoney Bonofide clan, the members get to benefit from the eternal knowledge, the experience and the basic skillset of the members. We spend within our app. And everything that you're looking for is within the app. Wow. And we sponsor this through our accounts, of course by using the TruMoney app. Yes, which makes it fast, safe, and easy. You know, while avoiding the usual bottlenecks that come with work. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, as we speak, the TruMoney Bonofide clan are downloading this app. - Right now? - Yes. And our goal is to reach 5 million. Five million? That's not possible. I'll take questions later. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Uh, Captain Lagi, please come in. - Hello ma'am. - Sit down. Thank you. Um, sorry for pulling you out like that Captain. Captain T has just taken ill and this last minute booking is by one of our more important new customers. So why didn't we just cancel? This one, is one we want to make a regular. Alright. That's fine, anything for you. Thank you. And, sorry for the short notice, we owe you. You sure do. Just don't forget, I take dollars. Anyways, I will look into the details on the flight deck. And just in case there are any update, just let me know. - Thank you. - Alright. Thank you. - Aww. - Oh my God. Beautiful… strong ladies. So, it's a win for me. It's a win for us all. - Hello ladies. - Hi, Captain. Bono? - Hey you. - Hey. How long have you been standing there? Frankly, I don't remember. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just… dealing with my own stuff. Stuff enough to lead you to tears. I'm not crying. Then you really need to invest in waterproof mascara because this is certainly tell-tale. Tell me now. Please. Kore, I saw him. Who? Him. Lagi. Wait. Your vampire university boyfriend? - Hmm. - That Lagi? - Hm-mm. - Where? He was the pilot of the plane that brought me back - from the conference. - Wait, wait, wait. He was the what, now? The pilot. Ooh. Will you look at that? Karma is a bitch. So, he is now working for you? I hope you left him a big tip. Hmm. How bad was your relationship with this Bono lady that she's so mad at you? Bad. How bad? Intoh, just let this one pass. But really, how bad? I'm just asking. I want to know. Oh, because I am a lady, yeah. And I have an opinion that both of you have not considered. So tell me. Tell me, tell me. - Lagi treated me like trash. - I know. No, you don't understand. - I know. - That boy dealt with me. - So... Sorry. - He… Sorry dear. He messed with the core of my being. There was one time I saw her talking to this guy… that I knew was interested in her. I was so mad. I walked up to her and… dragged her by the hair and pulled her all the way home. And then I beat her. And that wasn't enough, I… I slit my wrist and make her drink my blood. What? You did what? I made her swear to me, never to lie. And then I locked her up in the room… for two whole days. Without food or water. Nobody could stop me. No one… could stop me. Nobody. - Nobody! - Guy? Just take it easy. Ah. - Sorry. - Kore… Kore, I'm so angry. I'm... I fe... I still feel so angry inside. - I can imagine. - And, I thought that I was over him. I thought that I was done. And then seeing him just meters away from me. Hey. But I thought that he was abroad. I… I thought so too. I guess he is back, and he is alive. Give me your hands. Give me your hands. Lagi, you know everybody was very scared of you back then. Ah, no, no human could stop you, like just to… Eric, it's enough, please. We've had enough for one day. Intoh, I'm sorry I scared you. I'm no longer that person. This was… in the past before I gave my life to Christ. We didn't even believe you when you said you had given your life to Christ. Up till now, some people don't believe that you've given your life to Christ. They say it is like selling a unicorn to an Igbo trader. - You know how it is. - Seriously? No, but… you know now. Yeah. It's a bitter lesson for me. In hindsight, I just… exploited a totally innocent girl. You're certainly not expecting this same girl to take you back. Are you? Hm, because, hm. In my expert opinion nothing is going to make me take your Dracula sorry ass back. Like nothing. Why are you laughing? - You were there? You knew? - He is my… man. He's your… he's your man. Okay. - It's well. - But I have to try. I have to do everything within my power to get her back. She's my soulmate. - Hmm. - Now, I know. What's that smell?

Ah but, when Lord lays it upon my heart, I will get back to the studio again. - Okay. - No, but your Pop is not yet done son. - Pop? Really? - Mm-hm. Okay. You want to know what the real source of my joy is? Sure dad, I'd like to know. It is in your decision to be finally more active in the service of the Lord. And one of the things that would help you settle down, focus on this, is marriage. Dad, - please not... not this. - What about, what about Lami, in the choir? She is a very grounded young lady.

Speak for yourself. That's how you missed my other launch party. Hmm, see, don't even get me started on the amount of things she's missed out in her own life. - No way. - Mm-hmm. Bono? Bono? - Guys. - Are you okay? - I'm… one hundred. - Excuse her, she is fine, it's just work related - Yeah. - Pressure. Okay. I mean, that is why we have this all-white party. - Okay, to get loose.

I know the last person you want to talk to right now is me. I had to find a way to get your number from your reservation details. It was really nice seeing you the other day. It's easy to see that you're doing very well for yourself and, I am truly happy for you. Bono… look, I'm sorry. I really am. I didn't need seven years to realize that I must have been the worst. Leaving you cold turkey back then, I didn't know any better. It truly was not planned. I…. Please we need to talk. Even if it is… just to find closure. I would like to hear what you have to say and I sure have a lot to tell you. Please, let's have dinner or something. I promise, I won't take much of your time. I got you this. Thank you. They smell and look lovely. Getting cocky, are we? Oh no, uh, quite on the contrary. I'm just uh… grateful that you finally agreed to meet with me. I told myself there was no harm in hearing you out. I didn't think a day would come I would see you act half-human. Ouch. But I guess I deserve that. Bono… I'm just happy that I get a chance to explain myself. Bono, I've missed you. Lagi, I didn't come here to have a conversation to go down any emotional route. Yeah, I guess I should be, ah… Good evening ma, good evening, sir. So, what would I get for you today? Uh, we're not ready yet. We'll… send a signal to you when we're ready. Sure sir. Sure. Seven years Lagi. That is how long it's been since you walked out of my life, and didn't look back. Bons… look… - Let me explain. - I don't care for your explanation. I want to know what happened to you. What changed you? What changed the "great" Lagi Gowon? I want to know. I died, Bons. I was told I died for four minutes. I was poisoned while having drinks with people I considered to be my friends. , I'll spare you the details but, I was haemorrhaging real fast and spilled from losing consciousness to not being able to breathe for four whole minutes. That's when people rushed me to a hospital. After four minutes I just started to breathe again. I just came back. I was deeply affected by it. And so I just became reclusive, I stayed away from my social circles. And that is when my dad seized the opportunity to intervene in my frankly hair-brained lifestyle. Yeah, and he… whisked me down to Australia. To the Hill song International Leadership College. What? Those Jesus fanatics? Aren't they the sloppy folks that release, Christian songs every year? Bono. Jesus fanatics? You use to love them. Um, Lagi, you cured me of that rubbish. Remember? No, wait, something doesn't even add up. How did your father send you to Hill song? I thought you guys were very was poor? Yeah, that isn't entirely true. Why am I not surprised? My dad is the founding pastor of Trinity Place. Bishop Lincoln Gowon is your father? - Yeah. - Lagi?! Do I... Who are you? Do I even know you? Did I ever know who you were? Bons, I was rebelling against my family. And now let's just say I'm at home. With… with church, with my family. With God. And the scary part is I'll soon be ordained a pastor. Pastor Lagi. I know right? So weird. But you know what? - I'm excited about it. - Hmm. I'm going to be in charge of the youth. Just like you use to work with community kids. Um, that was a long time ago Lagi. That is no longer my life, look at me. - Really? - Yeah. So what's your life about now, Bons? Hope you enjoy and do come back. I will. Thank you. - You're welcome. Bye. - Bye. Oh, my feet are killing me and it's only been half a day. - So sorry my love. - Thank you. But at least you have work and, um, people are coming, you have customers. That should be good. Please, what is this tea? - Tea beans. Chocolate orange. - So, so good. It's so yummy. You need to bring some home when you're coming. Hmm. So, dinner with recycled trash? I know you. I know something is on your chest. Just let it out. Bono, why? I honestly don't know what you are talking about. I'm actually lost. Lagi. See, I'm offended that you have a revenge plan and I'm not your star character in this plot. What revenge plan? Kore, I don't have a revenge plan. We are just two people who were hurt from our past and we are just trying to find our way back to the light. - Hmm. - Yeah. - Bono? - Hmm. I know you say the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. But this guy, is berry berry bad news. Kore, I love you. - If I have not told you, I love you. - Bad news. But honestly, there's nothing. For me, it is the demon that I know, over the angel that I don't. Especially when this demon is on his way to becoming an angel. - You see, it's a win-win. - Hmm. I agree. With the demon part. ♪ We give you ♪ - ♪ All ♪ - Good. - Up, up, up, up. Good. Yes, that's it. - ♪ The glo... ♪ - Hey - Bono? - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing here? Well, I was finishing a meeting nearby and I decided to just check out the new Trinity Place and of course, it's new pastor. Well, well, well. You didn't tell me it was this big. I love it. - Hi! - It's uh… the first fully air-conditioned 3000 capacity auditorium in Nigeria. And um… Um, Lagi, if I didn't know better, I'd say that you are nervous about my being here. Bono, not… Not really. I'm glad you are here. - It's just uh… - What? Do I put a stain on your impeccable reputation? Bono, let's not do this here. Okay? Please. Hm. You know what? Better still, let's not even do this at all. I'm sorry I came Lagi. Stop, Bono. Bono, can you… Bono. Bono. Come on, please. That's not what this is about. - Let me explain. - Hmm. Hello, young lady. Dad.. - Uh, this is my friend. Bono - Not for long. Anyway, you must come visit us on Sunday. Okay. When Lagi, would be too busy to disturb you. Okay sir. I would give that a thought. - Thank you. - Thank you too.

I saw what you wrote about, Lagi. And I'm worried. What's going on? Mum, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm fine. Really, I am. And Lagi and I are fine too. Come sit. Mummy look, I've had a long day and I'd rather just rest. - I'm tired. - Please, sit. Bono. You have been through a lot. And I'm proud of how you… overcame everything, after all he put you through. I also saw my little girl change and the sacrifices you made to get here. I would only wish - you could come back to church. - Mum, no. Please. - Please, no. - I know. I know. I'm just a mother that loves and cares for her daughter. And would give everything to see her happy. - This newfound connect with Lagi. - Mm.

It is my fault for thinking I could invite my "boyfriend" for a meeting with a client that is known for zigging when he should zag. - Hey, hey. Hey. - No, no. It's fine. I'm dealing with too much already and I don't need this. - Can you just calm down? - Wrong words. Hey! I'm, I'm sorry, Bons, okay, I'm being… I'm being selfish. You should order something. - No, no. I'm uh… I'm good. - Stop. Waiter! Please come. Whoa, whoa whoa whoa!! Rough night huh? Huh? What are you doing here. You called last night, remember? Something about needing to talk. But it was late, so I couldn't come. And I decided to come this morning. Have some. Thanks. How did you get in? Hmm. Ah, this is so good. Ah. Hi. Hello. Um, sorry, I thought this was Lagi's place. Yeah, it's his place. Please come in. Oh, I left some eggs on the stove and you know men and burnt food don't mix. You know what? I just remembered that I have a meeting to get to. Can you let him know that Bono came over? Okay then. Are you sure that you don't want to come in? - Mm-mm - Alright. This Anita and King, eh, like, I'm tired of them, two of them. So annoying. So annoying. I'm really, I'm really I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm already... It's even you that's still watching - because these people are making me angry. - I love the show. Anita actually makes me happy. Hmm, you'll watch it all by yourself because I'm tired. I'm… ah. Do your work now. - You are going next. - It's fine. Hey. Come in. - Hey. Bono, ah, can we talk? - Hm. It's only right that you start calling me before you come here. Because I'm really not up for seeing you today. Bons. You know what's funny? I came over to yours earlier on today. Yeah. To apologize for getting you mixed up in all that. But what did I meet? Your lovely egg-frying girlfriend. Um… um, I want to go and fry some eggs. Anyone wants some? No? Okay. Take that as a no. Excuse me. Hey. Hey, she is just a friend. Okay, nothing more. Look, Lagi. I'm not that girl. No, no. I'm really not the kind of girl to be looking over her shoulder just because of a man. I'd rather just move on. It's not that deep for me. Hey… listen Bons, she is just a friend. - Okay? - Yeah, whatever. Yes? Hey, listen, I… I can't seem to remember what happened at the club. Yeah, I've been trying to put the details together but… I don't remember. Well, you… you had quite a lot to drink. And I know that you didn't want to get wasted. And I… I tried to stop you. So, I'm actually sorry for getting you mixed up in that. No, no. It's… It's okay. It's not your fault. So, we're cool now? We're cool. Okay, good. So what can I offer you? Well since you're asking, - I… - Ah, I don't know, give it your best shot. I don't… I don't, I don't know. What, what do you want to have? - E... - Eggs. Yes, Kore, eggs. What? Orange juice? Well, after the kind of night that you had, I understand. But listen, Thank you for not making a big deal out of this morning. I know it… meant a lot to you. So, thank you. What's the matter? Look, Lagi, I'm not that soft girl that you use to date. And I can't even pretend to be her. I've worked so hard, and fought so hard to be where I am today. And I need you to believe that this… this thing we're doing is not easy for me. At all. I know, baby. I do. And, against my better judgment… I don't even know how to say this. I… I think I've fallen hopelessly in love with you. And, it's okay if you don't feel the same way. I do. I do. I really do. - Really? - Yes. Listen, you don't know how this makes me feel.

Bless you. - Sir, I think we have a problem. - Please be seated. We live in a world full of troubles but be of good cheer, God has overcome the world. Sir, I think you need to see this. What is the meaning of this? Lagi, tell me how. How your picture appears in a lounge with two women and dressed up in this indecent manner. And your only excuse is you cannot remember? Lagi? Come on. You need to give us something here. We can only defend you if you tell us the whole truth. Ah, forget it. He cannot remember. I have nothing to say to him right now. - Dad… - Please, leave. Right now. - Pastor. - Bishop. Please prepare the other pastor for the ordination. Bishop, we have journalists in the foyer. The picture has leaked out in the social media. And there are all kind of speculations. Hmm. - Cancel the ordination. - Yes, Bishop. Please, leave me in peace. Yes Bishop. So we're back to drinking now? How does it feel to be humiliated? You see, Lagi, for the longest time I thought you were… untouchable. Indestructible. All powerful. Lagi, you couldn't be stopped. Even when you knew that you were destroying me, Lagi. You didn't stop. You're a snake. You know that, right? You're a deceitful little snake. And you know how all snake end up? Crushed. They all get crushed. This is all your fault and you'll be punished for this. Look, Lagi, you don't honestly believe that we are where we were seven years ago. Where I was powerless and I couldn't stop you. And you'll be powerless to stop me now. You can't blame me, for demanding my, my pound of flesh. My mother and Kore had to literally stitch back pieces of my life, with a prayer and a wish. I slept with… uncountable men. Just trying to get someone to make me feel alive again. After your dehumanizing abuse. And all you can come up with is threats. No. Nah. Do you really think this is the right way to resolve the past? Hmm? Bons? Did you for one second just stop, to wonder why this happened to me? Hmm. Did it occur to you that maybe something... Oh please, shut up Lagi! And get off your high-horse. Do you think that at this time... point in time of my life, I'm thinking about your stupid upbringing and if you had any issues? Eh, you found righteousness. I'm happy for you. But a few nights ago, you didn't have anything to say when you gave up everything you held so dearly. You tossed it all in my bed. Does it sound familiar to you? Does it sound like what you did to me? Pastor Lagi? Fake pastor. I was rebelling! Don't you get it?! I was rebelling against… against God, against my dad, against the church. Against false religion. What I thought was false religion and what I was forced to grow up under. - You were just caught in the crossfire. - Oh, shut up! Stop with the excuses! You destroyed me! You destroyed my ability to love and trust any other man. What don't you get?! What?! And you're here trying to play the victim? To hell with you! Wait, you want to leave now? You want to leave? You don't want some more? Are you sure? Look Bons, you deserve your pound of flesh. Okay, and I'm not one to run away from my own problems. So go ahead… give it your best short. Did you ever love me? Was… was any of this real? Or… or was it a farce? There goes that stupid pride of yours again. Did you think I could just forgive you that easily? No way Lagi. Hell no. Heavenly father, forgive me for lying to your stupid son. Lagi, You have not even started feeling anything compared to what you put me through. You cheap discarded excuse for a man. So you think that you would just come and act like you were born-again. And I would just forgive you? Lagi, all that is nonsense. I don't believe in all that rubbish again. You see that Bono, she is dead and gone. This new one is born-again. You killed her, Lagi. You killed me. A girl that did nothing but love you. You kill me, and then you think that karma would just leave you? Hm, Lagi, karma is a bitch, and she is wearing a skirt. - Bono look... - Don't you dare touch me! Lagi, don't touch me. Pastor Lagi, the famous pastor Lagi. Caught frolicking in bed with women. This is just the beginning. Look, Bono, I'm sorry. Hey I... I don't know what came over me. I'm ashamed of everything that I did to you. I… I… I never knew that it wo... it would end up this way. I, I didn't even know what I was doing half the time. I wish I could… I could take it all back. But I can't. Bono… I regret it. I'm sorry, Bons. I love you. I love you more even now.

Please, please, all these my friends looking for free promo, you all are cheap please. It's fine. I'll just tell my PA to set up a meeting for you. It's fine. Okay, bye! We're great friends. Why have you been giving me weird looks all day? So what next? Now that your mafia vendetta is done. Oh. That. Well, I can proudly say that I would tick closure off my list. And now that I have my life back, you know, just focused on my Bonofide clan, making me some schmoneyy. Is that what you call closure? You destroyed somebody's life, Bono. You cannot just move on and act - like nothing happened. - Hold on, point of correction! I destroyed recycled trash. Do you remember those words? Because those were your exact words. Kore, it was nothing. He was nothing. If anyone was destroyed here, it was me. Kore, you do you think this is the life I want to live? I wanted a normal life. How can Lagi hurt me and just walk away scot-free? Come on. Come on. Just maybe. Just maybe, you should be thanking him. Because that experience made you the success you are today. Kore, if all this comes with being destroyed by Lagi, then God or who else is out there, whoever is out there should take it away from me. Because Kore, I hate my life. I hate it. I hate it so much! I hate it! Honey. Yeah dear. Did Lagi pick up the last time you called him? - Who? Lagi? - Lagi. yes, Lagi. Uh… nope. - You're not worried about that? - No, I mean… no. I've told you not to worry. He's fine. Lagi is fine. Guys actually don't act like that. He's probably… you know, out of town, flying people around. And that's why he is not picking the calls. Don't worry, Lagi is fine. Relax. But, if he was flying people around, his phone would not be ringing. Please let's go and see him. Please. - Wow, that's true. That's true. - Please. Okay. - Since morning you've been calling him. - Let's go and see him. Something in my guts just tells me something is not right. Okay, we'll go. At least let's prove you wrong. I don't mind. Please. I would've sent a mail to the department, you know, giving props to the head as, for taking charge. And then in the same email, I would've thanked the other workers for doing what they did, you know? I'm obviously still massaging the ego of the head. That way I don't make anybody feel bad, everybody feels appreciated and no one feels like they didn't thank them. Dodging office bullshit 101. - Yeah. - That's a good save. Yeah, office politics can be really hectic. I know, tell me about it. Look, enough of me. I want to know more about you. Really, what do you want to know? I'll like to know what you think about me. That is very Johnny Bravo-ish. Ah, my favorite girl. She knows her cartoons. I like that. So, ah… Thank you. So what have I done to deserve this? Hm? Don't be so grateful yet. This is an inquisition master's dinner. Why? Intoh called. They are worried about you. I'm fine. Yeah. They have no need to worry. You have no need to worry. Okay? I'm just recovering from a flu. Wow. Someone you know? Excuse me. You know you can get that if you want to. It's not a problem. No, no, no, no. Honestly, it's just a very pesky someone, it's nothing serious. Yeah, hmm. - Right. - So yeah, what were we saying? Are you okay? Yeah. Tunde, is so intelligent. The man legit looks like a dream. So, when should I schedule this one into your little black book? What? You don't want two one-night stands clashing now, do you? Ha-ha. Very funny. Ah! Kore, this one, he is different. Like I'm not even keen on inviting him over. - Wow, wow, wow, wow. - Yeah. - Tha… That is the first. - Yeah. I must record this change. Please what's that date? See the thing is, he is such a gentleman. Do you know he didn't try to kiss me. I'm telling you. He just walked me, you know, down. Gave me a peck on my cheek. Sniffed my neck. Told me I smelled decent. And then he walked away. What a man. Wow. I'm not gonna cry. Please, does he have a cousin twice removed? - I'll ask. - I'm not picky. I'll ask. I'll ask, Kore dear. I want… I'm just kidding. But, can you take it one step at a time? Please. I'll be careful. But he's a good guy. I have nothing to be worried about. - Sounds like it. - Mm-hm. - Smells like it too. - I know, right? Aww. So what's up? Yeah. I heard you requested some, time off. I hope you feel better now. We missed you around here. Yes ma, I do. As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here. Hmm, okay. Do you care to share why you want to resign? Ma'am, it's uh… it's quite straightforward. I don't think I can… - give you my best anymore. - Rubbish. You're one of our best pilots. Everyone goes through tough times. Everyone. I will not accept this resignation. Go on vacation if you want. And come back refreshed. Consider that at least. Okay? Bons? Really? Lagi. So you think you can just show up at my house whenever you feel like? You just cost that security outfit their job for nothing. Bons, can I just talk to you? Lagi? How else can I say it to you? I don't feel like talking. Period. - Okay, fine. - Hm. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me? Please, I love you. Aww. I don't love you. And I never have. Lagi, please leave. Please get out. - Come on. - Lagi, leave. - Bono, all I'm... - Get out! - Who was that? - Who else will it be? - Mm-hmm? - Hmm. - See, I'm tired. - So you've finished packing? Eh, mm-mm, I just like traveling with empty luggages. You know, that way I won't pay for extra. So you're going… You're going without me? I'm done begging you. See, and if Lagi has any sense himself, he would be done begging you too. - You, you don't have sense. - Mm-hmm. - Don't leave me now. - Ah! Hm, watch me go. - Don't leave me, don't leave me, - I'm going. - Don't leave me Kore - I'm going. Eh! See? I'll miss you. Aww. I won't miss you. How many times does she need to humiliate you before you let her go? - That's not nice. - Thing is becoming embarrassing. I'm telling you, I... Look, I don't know how to explain it, okay? I've tried to… to get her out of my mind. But I can't. It's like I'm stuck. I don't even know how to describe it. It's described as love Lagi. But this one is toxic. I mean, even if it's meant to be, I feel like you need to step back a bit and breathe. You need to breathe. Yeah. Have you heard from your parents? - No. - Hm, they're worried oh. - Bish called me again last night. - Yeah, yes. At least pick his calls. I'll call him when I'm ready, okay, I like… I'm not just ready to speak to them yet. - You need a distraction. - He does, please. You need a major distraction. That's what you need. Ah-ah, the world does not revolve around one girl. - What about the XO? Yeah, - Yeah! XO. Because I thought you guys were hitting it on well. Or are you now holding onto her religion Religion thing isn't a problem anymore, but, I just can't shake her off. I… I can't shake Bono off. I don't know why. Hey, you wanna know why? Guilt. Guilt of the past. - That's what is disturbing you. - Hello. - You need to forgive yourself first. - I'm tired of hearing about this. When you forgive yourself then you can move on. Uh, please, can I have lemon slices. Er, malta lemon slices Yeah. And uh, tonic water for my man here. - Babe. - Hm? - Tonic what? - Tonic water. That's… for, for me? - Yes, tonic water. Please put ice. - It's tonic… Yes, tonic water. I'll have, uh, gin on the rocks. Pease, neat. Thank you. When did you start drinking? Guy, let me be. Please, let me be. - Pastor Lagi, - Please. Are you supposed to be drinking? Given your profession and your confession. My confession, is that I'll be okay. - Okay. - Okay? - You'll be okay. - I got this. Yes. I've told you to do something about this. I did. I did. He's a stubborn goat. I did. - Okay. - Wait, You realize I'm sitting right here. - Intoh, hold him now. - I'm holding. What are you saying? Hold him, hold him, hold him. - He, he's falling oh. - Holy Spirit. Whoo. Don't march my leg. Ow. Ah. Why don't you just injure me. Put… put… put this away. Wait, but wait. Remove his shoe first. Take out his shoe. Put your leg inside. Remove out his shoes now. Please, I can't. You can remove it if you have the time. - Where is he running to? - Oh. Pilot, you're not flying today. Please come back. Take off your friend's shoes. - He is our friend. - No, not today. Ah-ah, did you forget? My guy. You've forgotten "my guy" when he was drinking. So take care of your guy and if I were you, go and collect bucket. Put water, put Dettol or put disinfectant and just put it by his head's side. Otherwise, you would mop vomit. It's not like you do anything in the house. Bye. I love you, my love. And please when you're coming back, don't wake me up. Eh, eh, not today. Not today. Don't wake me up. So who was that blowing up your phone the other day? Of course, you'd want to know. Well he was just an old fling. It's nothing really. Tell me more. Really? Come on, it's… Let's just not talk about that. I'm really not up for it. It's okay. I mean, it's okay. I'm just… I'm just worried for myself. You know, I'm hoping that you won't be having this conversation with some other guy about me. Wait. Are you asking me out in a roundabout kind of way? Ah, this is the exact problem with intelligent women. Well? You draw the line, fill it up, and then they read it to themselves. By themselves. Okay. So how's work? Really? So you're just going to change the subject just like that? - I... - No, I'm just goi... I'll act like that's - not what you did. - Okay. Work is good. And um, to be honest, just the usual kind of challenges that comes with my kind of work. You know, um, my work is like… chess. Mm-hmm? If you want to win, you have to be six steps ahead of the game. - Uh… Well and… - Yeah. You care to expand? Tell me more. I mean you can tell me more of this. Wow. Um, so I… I'm about to end my contract with TruMoney. - Right? - Yeah. - TruMoney? - Yeah. What is that? So, it is a mobile money app. And my brand influence for them was social media. Okay. So, technically I'm about to sign with a very similar company that is bringing a very similar product to the market. And, they saw what I did for them, for TruMoney And they were like, you know what, girl you're good. So they offered me double the pay that TruMoney gave me. So when my contract ends with them, and I'll shift my followers from TruMoney to them as well. See? Well, that's simple but isn't that… unethical? - I mean… - No. Um, not with the kind of strategy that I'm going by. Look, I said you just have to be six steps ahead of the game. It is a dog eat dog world out there. I mean, I, I feel sorry for these brands. - They are suffering. - No. No. You can't even say that. Do you know that majority of these apps, like these… clients, they're not honest. Do you… Do you realize that I over-delivered on my contract with TruMoney and they short-changed me? Wait a minute. How do you know how much they made to make you think they short-changed? I have my sources. I told you to stay six steps ahead of the game. In fact, please, is this an inquisition? No, no, I mean. No like, you came here for me to cook for you. - Please it is just conversation. - Exactly, so should I serve you? - Yes, please. - Exactly. Yes, please. - Do you want to pass me the plate? - Yes. Um, I've heard everything you said. Do you… or rather have you documented a… a statement? Yes, we have. It's uh, with your staff. It's here. Here it is sir. Um, do you have a picture of this man? I mean, the assailant. I do. Are you sure this is the man? I am 100% sure. His name is Tunde Bada. And he is a business analyst. You can go back to your post. Your case has just got tougher, young lady. How? What do you mean? - You see that picture on your phone? - Yeah. That is the son of the Inspector General of Police. No. That's not even possible. Okay, maybe I did not introduce myself properly. My name is Captain Lagi Gowon and I demand you give us... Do… do you know he told me that he was an poor man? He told me that his father had died. You can google the IG's picture. Gboyega Bada. - No, Bono. - Does that sound familiar to you? - Bono, wait. - Leave me. Um, whatever this is you can take it home and possibly come back tomorrow. If you so wish. Fraud. Fraudulent people. Now you know who the man is and you're running away. What on earth is this? Hello Bono, please sit down. Can someone please explain to me why my contract was prematurely terminated? That is a breach of contract. Especially when I have done my own end of the bargain. If I must add. Cut the bullshit, Bono. Excuse my French but the game is up. Can someone please explain to me what this is about? Because I would not be asking these questions again, my lawyers will. Look Bono, I'm sorry it has come to this. But information reaching us says that you already signed on to a rival brand. And, um, this happened before your contract ended with us. See, Bono, it pays to be six steps ahead of the game. Doesn't it? Do you know what? You all are a bunch of jokers. You don't even have proof. You don't. Oh yes, we do. Allow me to introduce Mr. Tunde Bada, the TruMoney silent partner we had spoken to you about. Double the pay that TruMoney gave me. So once my contract ends with them, and I'll shift my followers from TruMoney to them as well. See? You. I am sick and tired of shitty ass men. Why can't they just die of some stupid disease or jump off a bridge. There is definitely an epidemic of stupid, shitty ass men out there. I'm really sorry, boo-boo. - Honestly, this is not even funny. - You've really had your fair share. Hm, but, I'm still sulking that you chose to press play on all the drama in your life when I traveled. I mean, a rapist, and then a late night police station visit. Then a business deal is straight out of a spy movie. You really don't do things halfway, do you? Look, Kore, I worked my ass off for these TruMoney people. I even over-delivered on my contract for them. So what's going to happen to all that money TruMoney is yet to pay you as your last cheque? I'd have to... Obviously it's gone. But at some point, I will contest and get my money back. Shitty bags of shitty people. Aah, speaking of shit… when last did you hear from Lagi? - That's better, ah. - Don't let them get to you. - Girl. - It's not worth it. And can I add? I think you owe Lagi some gratitude because if he wasn't there... Mm-mm, mm-mm, please. I don't owe Lagi anything. I told him thank you there and then. That's that. I think God is calling. Hm. Kore, what a way to call. With all the shitty things that are happening in my life. Please eh, this was just a case of me trusting vital information with a very, very stupid man. Very, very stupid Tunde Bada. What a fool. I'm saying what I'm saying because not too long ago, you threw God a challenge. You told him he could take everything. And what does the Bible say about the tongue being the bringer of all evil? Um, sis, I don't know where you heard that one from. It actually says "Life and death are in" the power of the tongue and those that love it eat the fruit thereof." I think it is Proverbs 18:21. Something like that. And where did you get that one from? I don't know. Residual knowledge. - Eh-eh? - Hmm. Hm, - I think God is calling oh. - Please, He's not. ♪ Follow the ladder. ♪ ♪ Follow the ladder. ♪ ♪ Follow the ladder to heaven ♪ - ♪ Sister follow! ♪ - ♪ Bono follow! ♪ - Oh. - I'm tired. I'm sorry. So how you feeling? Better, I hope. Yeah, I feel… I feel much better. I can breath now without feeling the pain. - That's good. - Hm. Look, I… I know I haven't treated you right. And I know that you were really mad at me. Not really. As a Muslim I believe that what will be will be. We don't really fight for what is ours. - Ah, wow, that's beautiful. - Yeah. I'd like to get to know you better. If that's okay. I'd love that. I'll like that too but let's be honest we both know this is going nowhere. How do you mean? Your parents, my faith. The things that conspire against this are things we both hold in high regard. How do you say, uh… kicking against the brakes. How do you know that expression? Long story, but you get the idea. Yeah, I do. But I also know that the heart can want something so bad, that it keeps kicking and doesn't mind, you know, the pain and the bleeding. I agree with you. Right, but I'm wise enough to also know that that has not been my experience with you. You're kicking on someone else's door. XO. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Do you care to tell me about her? The girl at the restaurant, the other day. Come on, out with it. Out with it. Okay, uh… …Really. I thought I'd remember. But I don't know how it happened. So that was how Pastor Lagi became brother Lagi? You could say so. - Huh. - Yeah. - Okay. - Thanks for listening to me. I… I actually feel better. I'll tell you this one thing. Someone once said: Forgive yourself and your mistakes would follow. If you don't let Lagi go, don't expect anyone else to. Hmm. That is really profound. So, it is like what the Bible says in, uh… Philippians 3:13. You know, about letting go of the past. Letting go of things behind you and reaching forth for the things that are before you. - Lovely. - Yeah. So, what now? Now, you go after Bono. I know it's hard but that is where your heart is. At least, for now. And should that ever change, then you'll know. And you'll have the courage to fully move on. Wow, look who's spitting profoundness today. I wish I could take my own advice sometimes. That's a good idea. High-five on that. Okay, mum. Out with it. Why have I been summoned? You have not been summoned. I've just been a little bit worried and I thought to share my heart with you. Okay mum. - Kore told me some things… - Hm. That have me shocked, quite frankly. - Kore? - Yes. I would have done worse things than you if this had happened like, seven years ago. Mum, to be honest I don't feel like talking about this right now. - I don't. - I'm not asking you to talk. I'm asking you to listen. See, I'm not the one that was in a relationship with Lagi. But then I have come to terms with what happened. And I have come to forgive myself for not being vigilant enough, to have… noticed what was happening. I've also worked on myself to forgive that young man. And also to release him from my heart. Am I making sense to you at all? Yes, mum. And when I was thinking of… what to say to you, I asked the Lord and something dropped. A scripture dropped in my spirit. And that scripture is Joel chapter two verses 23, 24, 25 and 26. Mummy, where? Joel, chapter two verses 23 to 26. I'll read it to you. It says, "Be glad ye children" of the Lord. Ye children of Zion. And rejoice in the Lord, your God, for he had given you "rain moderately." Underline moderately. …"And he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain… in the first month. And the floor shall be full with wheat. And the vats shall be "flowing with wine and oil." Amen. And he said: 'I will restore to you the years that the locust had eaten. And the cankerworm, the caterpillar and the palmerworm, the great army which I sent amongst you. And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of your Lord, "your God that had dealt bountifully with you." And you, Bono Siaba Kuku, shall never be put to shame. - Can you say amen? - Amen. Lord, I pray you, complete the work you started in your daughter. Give her a new spirit, renew her mind Lord. Let the same spirit, your spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, quicken her mortal body, Father Lord. Thank you, mighty God. Thank you sweet Jesus. Lord, I trust and believe you. For in Jesus' mighty name I pray in thanksgiving. Amen. - Mummy. - Yes dear. Seven years ago, when I found out that Lagi had left me. Mummy, I cried. And the Lord, dropped this scripture on my heart. And I wrote it down. Mummy… Mummy, this is seven years… This is seven years after And God, has brought me back to the exact point where he spoke with me. Mummy, I was too stubborn and I was too angry. Ah, mummy, I was angry. I was too angry to listen. Mummy, this is seven years later. And God has brought me back to the first point when we first spoke. . This is something really great. Now you can see that - it is not about me. - Yes mum. Can we pray? Mummy I think I need time to process all of this. That's fine. But, I would like to pray with my daughter. - Okay, mum. - I… I…I don't need you to pray. O... Okay. Be on your knees. Amen. Mummy, what did you tell God? It's… It is done. Amen. It's between a mother and her God. - I love you daughter. - I love you mummy. Can I join? Oh, come. - Work around complete, Captain? - Yep. Looking good. This is news network 24/7. Breaking news. The private jet belonging to Airlift Aviation that just went missing last night has been found.

Also, in the aircraft was the air hostess, Chisom Joseph. No passengers were on board. First respondents and the rescue team are already on site. This is network news 24/7. Breaking news. I am Lara Blessing. Stay tuned. Mummy, no. Mummy, no. - No! - It's okay. It's okay. - No! Lagi! - It's okay. No, I've forgiven him. Mummy, I had already forgiven him. Forgive me, please. Mummy, I have forgiven him, already. Yes, I know. I've forgiven him. I was just waiting to tell him I've forgiven him. I know. Baby, please. Lagi, please, forgive me. - Bono… - It's okay. I'm so sorry. - I'm so stupid. - Calm down, calm down. Why did I wait? Tell me why? God, please. Please. - Mummy! - It's okay baby, it's okay. Mummy, help me ask him. I need a second chance. Please, Second chance. I have forgiven - God, please. I beg you. - Bono please. Anything. Just give me one chance. My-My Lagi. Mummy! - My baby, it's okay. - Mummy, the only man I've ever truly loved is gone. - Lagi, please come back. - It's okay. It's okay. God. Bono please, please. Please calm down. Bono! - Bono, no. - My baby. My baby, get some water! Get some water. My baby. No, mummy. I don't have… I don't have appetite. I'm not hungry. Okay. Please, if you guys don't mind. I'd just… I'd really like to be alone. I just want to process things a little bit. Are you… Are you sure? I'm sure. Okay. Well, as it is, I'd have to go and uh, pick up some more things. I'll probably have to be staying here a bit more. Hmm? Okay mummy, thank you. Good, good. You be good. Be strong. Hmm? Be strong. Promise me you'll be fine? - I will mama. - Love you, my baby. Love you too, mummy. - Alright, see you then. - Okay, mummy. Bye. Um… I'll need to head back to the shop. Put some things in place. It's okay, love. Just do what you need. Mum, did you forget your ba... Lagi? Yes. It's me, Bons. I came as soon as I heard. May I come in? Yeah. Sit down with me, please. Go on. Now, before I explain the airline news. I'd like to apologise for everything. If I could take it all back, I would. You didn't deserve any of it. - Lagi. - Just hear me out. Okay? Please. When you came back into my life, I… I was confused. I thought God had brought you back so I could help you heal. Imagine that. I thought I was responsible for your healing, but I was wrong. Now I know better. I know that wasn't what this is about. Now, I know God wanted me to be healed. Um, how could he do that? Lagi, I have not been a model daughter. I have rebelled in every possible way. And you know that. Yes, God is tenacious about his kids. Isn't he? He isn't one to give up so easily. And he doesn't judge the way we do. I know. Honestly, the occurrences that have happened these past few days Whoo. - They've been unbelievable. - Yes. But, I'm just… um, ah. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad too. So, are we good? Yes, of course. We are good. I… ah, I can't believe you're here. Awesome. I can't believe you are here. I need to call Eric, and, and mum, - and your dad and… - Hey, hey… - Don't worry. - We were so worried. Don't worry. - Really? - Yes. I have it all covered. Okay. Lagi, the timing of this whole thing is so crazy. Do you know I was going to call you this morning? Like I was going to call you this morning to tell you that I've forgiven you and because man, God has been dealing with me. Hey, hm. And honestly, I… I knew that you were sorry. I knew that you were honestly sorry. I was just playing hard to get. I was just… I was just being stubborn. I know. I know. I don't even know if this timing is right for this, but, if the past few days have taught me anything it's to live in the present. Ah, I don't know how to say this. Lagi, I love you. And I have never stopped loving you. I was just too proud and too stubborn to admit it. And… and, yes, I know that we're not perfect. Our relationship has a lot of hurdles but we would cross them. And I promise not to get angry at you again. In fact, I'll be a good girl. Now I can rest easy, knowing that you'll be fine. Okay. May I get some water, please? I'm parched. Okay, I will get you water. Is that all you need? Is that your soup? Yes, my mum made it because she was trying to force me to eat, I was so worried. You should've seen me. Okay, should I warm that up or I should just get water for you? - Water will be fine. - Okay, I'll be back. Alright. Where is he? Lagi? I don't, I don't understand. - Lagi?! - Who? Please have you seen my keys? - I've been looking for it every... - Kore, where is Lagi? - Who? - Lagi. Bono, calm down. What do you mean? I just left here literally two minutes ago until I realise that I forgot my keys. Bono, Lagi is… Lagi is dead. He is not. He was just here. I'm not mad. Calm down. - I'm calm. - Let me call your mum. No, Kore, he just left here now. - Lagi! Kore, Kore. - Let me call your mum. - Lagi was just here. - He couldn't have been. I've been outside our flat the whole time. I didn't move an inch. - Please, please, stop. - Kore. Look, look, he gave me this. You... He couldn't have. So, you saw a… Bon... Bono, Bono, Bono, Bono, Bono please, please, please don't do... Oh God, please don't do this. ♪ You're my tiny ray Of sun on rainy days ♪ ♪ You take my breath away my dear ♪ ♪ I can't help myself ♪ ♪ From falling for you love ♪ ♪ I miss you when you are not near ♪ ♪ You're such a lovely sight ♪ ♪ Much brighter than the starlight ♪ ♪ I'm still falling ♪ ♪ Sweetly falling ♪ ♪ Deep in love with you ♪ ♪ Blissfully I'm sweetly falling ♪ ♪ Deep in love with you ♪ ♪ You're my Christmas eve ♪ ♪ In June my honey in moon ♪ ♪ You're really funny too ♪ ♪ Stay forever boo ♪ ♪ Oh life is beautiful ♪ ♪ With you it's a perfect point of view ♪ ♪ You're such a lovely sight ♪ ♪ Much brighter than the starlight ♪ ♪ I'm still falling, sweetly falling ♪ ♪ Deep in love with you ♪ ♪ Blissfully I'm sweetly falling ♪ ♪ Deep in love with you ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ Blissfully I'm sweetly falling ♪ ♪ Deep in love with you ♪ Subtitle translation by: Anu Akiyode
