- Nella. - Hiya, Toma. I'm gonna make some dinner, all right? - Dinner. - Yeah, bangers and mash. - Father! Found him. - I'm here to accept the proposal. - Inside. - Yes, well, obviously all of the hot list housing requires an effort on the part of the occupant. Hence, the quick availability of the properties. Don't you want to have a look around? - We'll take it. - It's done. - Shit! Shit. - Now, the tattoos will grant you our magic for one moon only. Liam speaks for me. He'll show you the rituals once you have permission from the laird. Cathal. - Yes. - You can use these powers to hunt down and kill the boy. No others. - Yes. - You all right? - Yeah. Where do we start? - Bonnie Scotland, Lothian. - Happy birthday. - Thanks, Ma. - This is the end of the road. Come on then. (fire raging) - It's okay. He's not gonna bite you. Do you want to pet him? - Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff. Dog. - Hey, dog. You're beautiful, aren't you? Here you go, Toma. - Sweets. - Oh, he's gorgeous. What's his name? - It's Bran. - Hi, Bran. You just move in now? We're on the same landing. I'm Petronella. - I'm Fergal. - Come on. - What? - Come on, we'll take your dog for a proper walk. I'll show you around. I'm meeting a pal over at the swings. Come on. Why do people do that? Well, you don't say much, do you? Aren't you gonna give me a push? - Sorry? - A push, come on. Come on, you push like a lassie. Whoa! Whoa! - Nella! - Hey, Ally. - Apparently likes the minutes. They're coming back. Should be out bangers, helping Cheek she keeping it. - Is Tuck coming back? - Aye, he's still 15. He looks terrible, but Liza's bird gave him a proper hiding like. - How are you doing? - What do you think you're doing? You can drop with the babes now by the way. - How do you mean? - Do you think after shooting your mouth off about me in the chippy, telling everyone what a slag I am and all that, I'm gonna let you so much as touch me again? Watch it, Cam. - How do you mean? - How do you mean? How do you mean? Is that all you can say? Is that it, you wee dick? - What the fuck you looking at? - It has nothing to do with him. - I wasn't talking to you. - I said what the fuck you looking at? Shite, you better look away. You're getting done, you wee dick. - No. You're the one with the wee dick. - Go it easy boy. Game on, aye. Oi. Come on, boys. Game on, aye. He's a got it. - For fuck's sake, Petronella. You're lucky he's not the type to hit lassies. - What? It's not like I could take him - All right, boys, what can I get you? - It would be me honor to buy his lordship a drink. Lordship, me father sends his warmest greetings. I have to request your favor and permission. We bring a hunt to your lands. - I can well what it is you seek. I felt his presence here. - We're here to help you. Our hunt is just. - Do you think I'm a puzzled wing? Like I need your help. Just. What would you know about what was just and all? Keep your monkey's leash held tight, aye? Out of respect for your father. I'm sure he's got his reasons, but I don't like this fool running around in his shiny new skin bringing attention down on us. Things are bad enough. - Natural order. The deed is his to do. I guide him in this. - So you vouch for him? - I do. - Very well. I'll consult in this. I'll let you know my decision in the morning. - What the fuck was that? I'm trying to do the right thing here. - Calm down, gotta let the dog see the rabbit. We need his permission, you know. - He called me a fucking monkey! - He coulda done a lot worse. You're left with all your bits still on ya. Let's see what he says tomorrow. - All right, well, I need a drink. - I thought you didn't drink? - I didn't, I just. I got it on wing. - Is that such a good idea, Cathal? - Listen to me, I'm all geared up for the hunt, you know. My skin's itchy with all this fire. And I have to sit in a box while some old sod prevaricates about whether or not I can get on with it? I'm going for a drink, it'll keep me calm. - All right, all right. - So what were you doin' all day? - Just looking around. - You meet anyone? - Some kids. - Girl kids or boy kids? - Ma. - So you were hanging around with girls? You admit it? - If I'm going to live like a normal kid I'm gonna meet girls. - There's meeting and there's meeting. You know what I'm talking about. I can see it, Fergal! I can see it in you! The desires, the change. You can't be like that! - Ruff ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff! - James. - What? - They can see you. - So? - I'm not doing it with an audience. - Another frigid bitch? Just what I need. - Don't egg me like that, aye. - For fuck's sake. - You're as bad as that fucking Paki. Oi. - Hey! You shag her? - Yeah. - Cheers. You're looking the worse for wear for last night. Good food, you're only a man. Trust me. You'll feel a human again with that inside ya. - I'm just not hungry, all right? - You'll have your hunt. Seeking and divining are allowed. You won't be allowed to consult. - Me father did grant the power to consult. The skin allows him all of our glamors and our magics, and I've been giving him instruction. - I won't allow it. I've spoken to the dead. They don't want him in their domain. - They don't want me in their domain? - Not that I blame them like. I don't want you in my domain. You don't think I care about last night? You don't think you were watched? - Sorry, laird. Thank you. Right. We better be off then. Come on. - You again? What now? - Is your mother here now? Don't care. - Excuse me? - Nella. - I said, I don't know. - What do you think the social would make of you minding that lad all on your own? You're only a school child. - Go on. I don't know, but I'm pretty sure it's none of your fuckin' business. - How dare you speak to me like that? - Well, why'd you threaten the social on us? - Look, I'm not threatening anyone. Just please, pass the message on to your mother. - You all right? - Yes, I'm just having some trouble finding a flat. - Really? Don't they teach you that in housing school? - You don't happen to know which flat the Nickery's are residing in, Mary and Fergal. - Sorry. - Hey. Hi. - Fergal. Fuck is all this? - Protection runes. My Ma has some different beliefs. - No shit. So what, is she like a witch or something? - Yeah, I guess you could say that. - Cool. - Hey, listen, my Mom doesn't like me hanging around with, um, girls. - Ooh. Forbidden fruit. (crunching) Don't worry, I won't tell your Mom. Be over at the swings after lunch. - Yeah, boys. - Oh, hey, Petro-head. - Look, Gene, just fuck off, all right? - I think she's still in love with you, ginger boy. - Listen, did either of you see Ally last night? - What? - Ally, she never came home. - No, I never seen her. - You did, didn't you? - It's none of your fucking business anyway. - Oh, no, that's nice. Don't waste your time, do ya? Come on. You might get her to call home before her Mom calls the police. - Weren't you hanging out with her? - I don't know. Better fuck off with you, mate, all right? - All right, man. I'm only fucking asking. Come on. - It's a good likeness. You have his image inside your head now. Just remember what I've told ya. Self-control. Stay out of fights, stay away from girls. Take the dog out. I have to cover the protection. - You've got a nice smile. Even though you're totally balmy clearly. It makes me feel okay with ya, like I could trust you. - I trust you too. - How come? - Because you came by my house earlier. - Right, you live next door to me. - Yeah, but the runes my Mom painted up mean no one meaning us any harm can find the house. - You don't really think your Mom's a witch, do ya? - Me and my Ma, we're from people who are different to you. We're not normal. Most of our people left this world. Those that stayed just hid in the shadows, waiting patiently. - Tell you what. Your balminess is very cute. - I should go. I'm gonna be really late. - Sure, you don't want your Mom turning you into a toad, do ya? Can I see you later, Fergal? - I don't know. - Okay, but. Would you like to? - Yeah. Yeah, I would. - Looking for me? - Yes, yes I was. - Why do you mean us harm? - I don't know what you're talking about. - The only people I protected me and me boy from are those that mean us harm. - I don't know what your talking about, Ms. Nickery. I'm here because some of your forms have been filled in incorrectly. And I'm rather concerned that you may have deliberately filled them in inaccurately. - I lied on them, what of it? - Well, in that case, I shall have no choice, but to remove you from the property. - And how on earth do you plan to do that when you can't even find our house? I could have you wandering these streets like a lost child till your end if I wanted. - Don't try and frighten me. I'll have the police on you. I'm warning you. - You're warning me? Listen carefully. These are words of power. I put upon you this curse. You will wander these parts tortured, unable to know your path, your name, your way. This will be your lot until you breathe your last. - Oh. - Divining is most effective at sunset. We will perform it once a day. I'll summon the bird. You say the words and perform the sacrifice, just like I told ya. You reach out with your heart and you read them out. - I understand. - It's a slow, steady method. She can't block us unless she gets her hand on one of the sacrifices. And we will find them this way. Might just take a wee while. - Okay. Summon the bird. - Now reach out and feel for your prey. - This way. About six miles. - Cathal. You can't be leaving a mess around like that. It'll come back and bite us in the arse. - Where? Oh. Which way? Where was I supposed to be going? No, hold on. It was that way. I was, I was that way. - Toma, Toma. Come on. We're gonna be late. You've slept in. Toma, come on! - She's settling here, letting destiny take it's course. - Why doesn't she keep on running? - Time for that's passed. Whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see. - How can you joke about this? - Isn't that just like an Irishman to make a joke out of a serious thing, and a serious thing out of a joke? - Look, my head's wrecked. - Be back by sunset! Have a clear head! Make her pay. This hunt is nothing. Kill them both. You're close, bitch. I smell you. - Hey, watch where you're going? - Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Where the fuck are ya? Come on! - Jesus! - And don't be spending so long in the bath. I need you to eat this. Please. Please, Fergal. You need to keep your strength up. That's a good lad. - Are you able to summon here? - Will you just relax? They're in this estate. Keep patient, we'll find them. - What's the matter? - It's not working, she might have blocked us. - What are you's doing? - None of your fucking business. - How 'bout I make it my business, you cunt? - Hurts, does it? Now. Have you seen her? - No. - There's no sense in that and you know it. - Have you seen her? - Ah, no, no! - You sure? - She blocked the divining. She must have found one of our birds. I hope we'd been careful with that. - So what now? - Seeking, divining then seeking. We should be able to gather all the stuff for sunset tomorrow. - Oh, so we just ride off another day. I want their blood, Liam. I want these marks made permanent. - Nobody ever said it was gonna be easy. - Good? - Mm. - Fish and cold potatoes, you've always loved that. You need to stay away from him. - Nice to meet you. Fergal's told me a lot about you. - Look, I'm not gonna force you any more than I will him. You're both of age. But I'm warning you. Stay away. - I will. That's nice of you. At least you're not gonna force me. - You don't know Fergal, not the way I do. I know you think you do, but you don't understand-- - No, you don't understand. Fergal's a wonderful guy. You've kept him locked away from people his whole life, and now he's finally living. Let him go. - Petronella. I warned you, remember that. - Just fuck off, all right? Don't try and threaten me. Come out. Come enjoy some walk. I just wanna hang out with you for a bit. Just be with you. - It's gonna rain. - I know somewhere we could hang out. Oh man. Look at all the pigeons. - I hate pigeons. - Petronella. - It's okay. Just be gentle, okay? - Sorry, what did I do? - Shh, there's someone down there. - What? - Look. Do you think he's living here? - We have to go, now. - There's no one following. - Are you okay? - I don't understand. - My Mom told me that if I ever met my father I was to run. Run as fast as I could. She's been telling me for years. There's a beast after me, Petronella. Because of my father. I think it might even be my father. But. Mama said it would be far worse if I was with you or myself. - Look, Fergal. Nevermind your mother, okay? What do you wanna do? - I wanna go. I wanna leave this place. But I can't go on my own. Would you come with me? - Fergal, I'd love to, I really would, it's just, Toma. Fergal, I just need to think. - You're home, son. What's the matter? Your tongue tire out? Was it good? The heat. Was it good? Did you feel the blood coursing through your veins? Or your pores opening up? Your skin become so sensitive you could hardly stand it? I can still remember the night. I can still remember the feeling of his hand on my skin. One night of passion and 15 years of hiding in shit. I thought it was a bit of fun before it took my life away. Sure, why am I telling you? Look at ya. The big man, aren't you? And the big man knows best, isn't that right? Hm? - Now? - She's gonna try to block you, but you've gotta be strong. Push your will past hers. Don't let her into your mind, yeah? - So it'll be a fight? - A battle of wills, yeah. - Good. - Now, feel her in your mind and move towards her. She's fighting it, concentrate. Concentrate. - Cathal! Cathal, Cathal, come on, Cathal! - What? Get off me! Get off! Fuck! - Tomatsk, go outside and play with your ball, yes? Play with your ball. - What's wrong with you? - He cannot be in this house all of the time. - Right. So you can get skinned full in peace? Fuck what's best for him, aye. - I am his mother, not you! Now take your ball and go and play. - Dog. - Come on, Bran. - Dog. - Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff. Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff. Dog. Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff. - My, but you're a sensitive one for such a big fella, aren't ya? Get your ball. Come on, Bran, come on. - All right, you Mongol hairy cunt, ya. See what I've got for you? Do you see it? - Toma? Toma! Toma? Toma? Toma, Toma! Toma! What? No. - Come on, the car's just over here, Ma'am. Just follow me. Your son is down at the station, but unfortunately you won't be able to see him until the detectives have finished interviewing. It's a very serious crime he's committed. You understand that. Come on, Ma'am, the car's just over here. She's going. - No! No! No! - You need to lift your legs. - Go to your room, Fergal. Stay there. Go to your room! - Where are you going? - It's over, Cathal. The laird's gonna have it himself. We have to go. - I thought it had to be me or you. I mean, how the fuck is he gonna do it? - There's other ways. It requires a sacrifice on his behalf. He doesn't trust you. - And me? What happens to me? - Go back to your life. We've tried everything we can. - No, we haven't tried everything. - He said no! - Look, Liam, your father gave me the part of consultant. We'll go and find those who know. We know where to go. - Do you not learn? You a wee bit simple like? - What the fuck's that supposed to mean? - The laird said no talking to the dead. Runes and incantations are not to be messed with, Cathal. Not in this world. Do you not remember what happened the last time? You knew it wasn't allowed. You knew you weren't allowed or didn't ya? But you were so thirsty for secrets. You've got all this blood on your hands and you still can't see it, can ya? - She tricked me. - No! She was a child, she was 15! You tricked her! - I need a drink. Will you have a drink with me, Liam? - What, I just don't have the time, Cathal. - I know. Have a fucking drink, aye. You people. All this far and you do nothing! Huh? Years I spent trying to worm my way in with you, but your arrogance! How do you expect any respect when you treat people like that, huh? Well, where's your arrogance now? Huh? Where's your fucking rules now, huh? You know what? She won't fucking beat me, you hear? I'll fucking kill them both! Fuck your rules! - Petronella. - Hiya. - What are you doing? - I'm going. I'm leaving. Do you wanna come? I'll be at the swings. Later. - Hello, James. Now. Come on. Come on, James, come on. (blood dripping) 12. Which block? Show me the block. - Couldn't sleep? - No, I was just-- - Taking money? Running away? Go on, I won't bite ya. I should've done more, prepared you for life without me. Sit down. A man came among us. One of the festivals. Spring's arrival. We thought he was a friend to our people. I was young. A youth's flattery. I knew what he was doing, but some part of me, something deep, wanted him. Wanted to. Otherwise I would have stopped him, wouldn't I? Any fruit of such a union would bring a terrible beast. My father couldn't kill me. I was meant to be his heir. But you. You were forbidden. (sighs) So he sent Cathal. Surely you felt it coming for ya. The beast. Do you understand? Go to your room. Go. Cathal. You have blood on your hands. - Mary. Long time no see. Aren't you gonna invite me in for a cup a tea? - Sure. Come in, we have a lot to talk about. - Talk about. Bitch! Bitch! - You fucking bastard! You ugly fucking-- - Me, you spoiled that filth. You tricked me. - You wanted him behind the curtain. You should be more careful what you wish for! - My cause is just. - Just! You don't know the meaning of the word! (Mary groans) - How's that for just, aye? Who'd a thought all of that fucking magic and what good is it now? - I am found! - Right. Boy! Boy. There you are. You know I'm gonna kill you, right? I'm gonna kill you and then this beautiful skin becomes mine forever. Blood of your blood, cast on iron, this is how you die. Them's the fucking terms! This is how it has to end, son. Now! - Petronella. - I thought you weren't comin'. You okay? - Yeah, I'm just really tired. - Come on then. You can sleep here for a couple hours. The most terrible stuff. We can leave it all behind. - What if I'm not a good man? - You are. I love you, Fergal. - Petronella. - It's okay. It's nice. It's okay. It's okay. Fergal. Fergal! Fergal. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! I can help ya. I know what to do about the creature. I know how to stop it, you understand? Now. do you understand? Okay. Right now he's between beast and man and can only be killed with a knife that's daubed with blood of his own blood. And I'm his uncle. You stand over there and I'll get to him before he gets to you, okay? Go on. - Run, Fergal! No. No! Fergal. Fergal, I love you. I love you, Fergal. - Anywhere you have to stay? - No. - You're not far gone, are ya? You hungry? Come on. I'll buy you a cup a tea and some chips. - How'd you know I was pregnant? - You couldn't have killed him if you weren't with his child. Come on. Yeah. Wee charm, for you and the babe like. Come on. - Send the beast up to his breast. I've seen the mist fall round and round in jest. For he comes, a human child. Through the waters in the world. With a fear hand and hand.
