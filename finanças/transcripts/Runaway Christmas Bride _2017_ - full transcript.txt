Do you Kate, take Alex to be your lawfully wedded husband? Bless you! And do you Alex take Kate to be your lawfully wedded wife? Yes. Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. May I present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Alex and Kate Atkins! Hey, everyone's out front waiting for us to leave. Oh. Umm sure. Are you okay? Yeah. Look, I have something to show you. What is it? It's from my grandmother. She died. Yeah, she left that for me. Two million dollars? Yeah. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner but that was part of the deal. I had to get married first and not let the bride know so that she married me for me. Finally, I'm out from under my father's crushing grips. I can do what I want, when I want! Alex. And you'll never believe this, he was collecting the interest and keeping it for himself. But no more, finally, I'm free! Alex. What? Is this why you made me sign that weird prenup? I was going to share. Was? Did you marry me for love or this money? You hesitated! Obviously Kate! Send them out. Send them out now. She what? My sister did what?

Oh! ♪ Another lonely Christmas but I feel that you are near ♪ ♪ Another lonely Christmas, maybe this will be the year ♪ Welcome. Congrats on the wedding! I have bad news. We are full. I have a reservation. Uh are you sure? It's the, uh, Honeymoon Chalet. Right. Uh, says here Alex. And Kate? Oh, well Alex is busy, so it's just me today. So if I could just get my room, it's been a very unfortunate day. But you just got married. Yes, I just got married and the honeymoon is already over. So can I get my room key, please? Let me see what I can do. Hello, Mrs. Atkins. Hello. How can I help you? I have a reservation. Uh, yeah, I do have a Kate and Alex Atkins due to arrive after midnight this evening. Yeah, well, I'm Kate and I'm early. And, uh, Alex, well that's a funny story, ulterior motives, lying, you know. I don't really want to get into it because... I can't stop them. It's like, broken... If I can just get into my room I will get out of your hair. Sure. I just need a photo ID and a credit card. No, I left everything back at the church. If I could get in tonight, I will make sure you have everything in the morning. I'm sorry, without a photo ID and credit card, how am I supposed to know you're really Kate? I'm wearing a wedding dress. Yeah, well anyone can wear a wedding dress and call themselves Kate. Listen. I've had a really, really long day. I need a long bath, a long cry, and multiple glasses of Vino. Can I have my room key please? Could someone email you the credit card and ID? No, I don't think I want to do that. What? It's not my problem. Yeah, well I have a lot of problems right now. Yeah, and I don't want any of them. You know what, I want to talk to your manager. My manager? Yup. Just a moment. Hi, I'm Becca! The manager. You're the manager? Mmh hmm. What's next, Supervisor? Me. What about Shift Leader? Moi. Umm, I can help. How about the owner? I'm sure he just sat down for a vigorous game of Bingo at the old folks' home. Hey! I can help. I'm on the waitlist. Use my credit card and ID and we could be roomies. I'll even split the room costs with you. You're like, 12. I'm 19. Same thing. Please. Just for tonight. No credit card, no ID, no room. You're on the couch. Righteous! Here. Oh this is good. Dudes! We have a place to crash. Nice! Dudes? Oh you have fun. Thanks. What are you doing? Do you have a new hobby? Peeping Tom? And that is a good night to you. No, no, I'm just kidding, I need to talk to you. I have to go into town tonight to have a meeting with Mr. Banks. Watch out for the black ice. Very funny. I was hoping that you would be able to drive me. - Now? - Yes. You know how Floyd gets. I have to be on the hill at six AM. Jason, you owe me this! No, I don't. Alright. Okay, fine. I will drive you. But I am not staying at your house. Of course. Okay. Okay. Good. Fine. Where have you been? Did you go to town with Becca? No. Stuck at the turn all night waiting for a snow plow. Becca's apartment, huh? No, I slept in the truck. Hey, it's okay to like a girl. I don't. Not that one. Jason, you're wanted at the base of the hill. Here we go. What happened? She probably sprained her knee. What run? Take a wild guess. Heartbreak Ridge. I'm telling you, that run is too dangerous for-- And you carry her down here yourself? Yeah. Dangit, Jason, you could have been hurt! Could've, but wasn't. How many times have I told you not to do dumb stuff? You could hurt your knee again and then that's it. I know. I know, I know. But she was in pain. It wasn't fair to make her wait. Looks like you've got a secret admirer. Yeah, probably not. Anyways, take care of that leg. Get some rest. It's okay, I'm here. Stay calm, keep breathing. Hello. Again. Hi. I'm Jason. Yeah, I've, uh, seen you galavanting on the mountain. Galavanting? Mmhh, it's quite impressive! You know, but you're not fooling me. I'm not? No. I'm on to you, rescuing lonely damsels in distress. Does that work for all the ladies, or? I wouldn't know. It's not something I usually think about. Is that so. Huh. How's your husband? What? You must be enjoying the hot tub in the Honeymoon suite. Oh, no I'm not married. That those guys they're my students. 'Cause I'm a an English teacher. And that was the only room available, so. So you're on a ski vacation during the Christmas break. Yeah. It's a private school and the parents are busy. So, I thought, we-- I'm Kate. Hello Kate, I am confused. That makes two of us. So, you're alone, less the four guys in your ski chalet. Just to clarify. Well I have my room. Yeah, correct. Okay, Kate. I am currently on my break and I am thinking about hitting some new runs in the backcountry. Care to join? Lead on. Hey, I'm, uh, thinking about going inside to get something to drink. You want something? Sure, how about something warm. - Okay. - Thanks. Next! Oh, um, no, no, no. I'm just waiting for my-- Look, if you don't tell me your Christmas wish than how do you expect it to come true? Sit. Come, come. Now, Kate. Tell me, what is your Christmas wish? Oh. Umm, well. My wish is to have someone to stand with me under the mistletoe. Ah, now that just may be a Christmas wish I can help you with. Thank you. Well, um, I'm going to go. Oh, Kate. You know it's always the gift you least expect that has the most significant meaning, and will treat you to the best memories, for years to come. Ho ho ho! Did you just see that? Santa called me Kate, and I never told him my name. Who? Nothing. Must be all this fresh air. Yeah. Hey! Hey Kate! Over here! Hey. Jump in. We saved you a spot. Uhh, yeah, how about a rain check? I have dinner plans. Righteous, yo. But don't worry, we could be going all night! All night? Gonna go hot tubbing later. You've gotta join. That's perfect. Perfect. Wahoo! You're good. You're pretty good yourself. Take a look. It's amazing. I love it here. Not your first time, I take it. No, I umm.. We used to have a Christmas tradition. Every year we would reserve a bungalow, with my Mom's family. Her two brothers and sister would bring their spouses and all the kids and we would have the biggest Christmas morning ever. And then we would hit the slopes all day. You know, my Dad was a very avid skier. Was? Yeah. One year, business was slow, and we couldn't afford it. And then the next year, and then the next year. So why come back now? I just thought this year I'm going to make my own tradition. I thought that I, I thought I could change things. But, hey, what about you, enough about me? Why are you here Mr. Slopes Olympian Champion Man? Oh no. You found out my secret. Oh, you have a lot of fans, and they aren't very, uh, discreet. I was on my way to the Olympics, and I shattered my knee cap, in a million places. Took me three years to put myself back together. I trained as hard as I could to get back to compete professionally, but it took awhile for me to admit that I was done. One of my former coaches found me a job, Director of Ski Patrol; made me an offer. Retirement for him, and. And you? I don't know what this is. Anyway, we should probably get down. It's going to get dark. Wow. You carried a woman down Heartbreak Ridge? It was not easy. And that is the one hill I don't ski. But, if you'd like, I know some fresh snow we can cut up. I don't know, it looks pretty enticing. Alright. Alright Wahoo, I won! Ah, lady wins, loser pays. I'll buy the loser a drink. Nah, it's okay, I never break a promise. Okay. Thank you for an amazing day. Oh! Oh, Kate, I thought you were the pizza guy. What's up, Dude? This guy, is he messing with you, Kate? No, it's okay, Mike. Bye. I'm watching you, Bro. I'm watching you. Hey, Jules, what's going on? I had another wedding, you should have seen it. A wedding where the bride and groom actually left together. Everyone is looking for you. I'm sure. Can you ship me my purse? I'm running low on cash. And can you overnight my credit card? Wait, where are you? Promise not to tell. Come off it, Kate. I'm at the resort. No, you went on your honeymoon? Except it's not a honeymoon, is it? Uh, hold on a second. Hold on a second! Hey. It's you. I'll be right out! You're with a guy? No! No, it's complicated. I need you to ship my credit card. I'm coming up. Just overnight them! I'm just here to pick up Kate. I don't know about that. Maybe you and I should talk. No, no, no! Thanks Mike. You should go back to that thing with your friends. Okay? Let's go. Well, here it is. Sorry it's so sparse. There's my Christmas tree. - Yeah. It's great because it never dies. You know what, I was right. Your place needs a little bit more Christmas spirit. Let's make some cookies for the carolers with these M&M's! That's a great idea. Great, let's do it! Thanks for hanging out with me even though I'm still on the clock. It was cool seeing you in your element, helping people. Hey, was that guy's injury as bad as yours? Mine was worse. It's amazing that you can still walk. That's what the doctors said, too. Hey, look, I've still got time for one more run. What do you say? Mmmh Heartbreak Ridge? I'd rather stick to Lover's Lane. Alright. Let's do it. - To Heartbreak Ridge. - To Heartbreak Ridge. So, ever been down it before? Oh, no. It's too steep for me. I meant in life. No, I think I'm doomed to be the heartbreaker. I guess I'm, uh, difficult. Oh, really. So, no boyfriend? Nope. Crazy ex? No. You? Never! You ever been married? Oh god no! It's just hard to believe that someone as beautiful as you are would be alone at Christmas time. Well, you're not any different. It is. I'm working. Oh, come on! I see the way all the girls look at you. You must have a girlfriend. I keep it simple. Okay, then. To simply being a liar. Am not. Yeah. Hello! Mmh, hi! Umm, Jason, Becca is looking for you. She's on the warpath. Great. Is everything okay? Yeah, it's fine. It's just, uh ski patrol business. I'm going to be right back. Order whatever you'd like on me. Okay. Great. Thanks. 'Cause I don't have any cash. Jason! Becca! What's going on? You have been avoiding my calls. I have been busy. With work. We had plans tonight! You had plans, alright? We did not. We are no longer a we. Okay, whatever that means. I have to set up for the Christmas Eve party and you said you'd help me. No, I did not. Yes you did. Whatever. Have you been drinking? I'm an adult. With who? You don't drink alone. Okay, you've got to give this up, okay? We're over. You and the runaway bride? What? No! Not her. Excuse me. The bellhop told me you're the manager. We need our room. Yeah, I'm sorry, Sir, we are fully booked. Please try back in-- I had a reservation. The Honeymoon suite. It's taken. It can't be. I booked it through my client, Floyd Banks. Yes, of course! We've had a tough couple of days and needed a getaway, so if you don't mind, we'd like to get in straight away. Please, right this way. I will talk to you later! No! What? Thank you for waiting! What did you say the reservation was under again? - Alex Atkins. - Atkins. Oh, yeah, yeah. You're already checked in. Here's the extra key. Already checked in? Yes, and may I say, what a lucky man you are. Kate is a beautiful bride. Oh, we'll see about that. Please tell her how sorry I am for all the confusion. She really is lovely. She took the honeymoon without the honey. Oh no she won't. Alex! Come on! My students' parents are jetsetters. I mean, Mike is old enough to get out of my hair but kids these days, right? Teaching must have its rewards, no? It does. Watching them learn is the most rewarding. What the? That could be Kate! Let's go! What is going on out there? What!? Whoah! Hey, Dudes, you come to party? 'Cause, uh, no entrada without el tequila, Amigos. Tequila? Where's Kate? Dude, Kate's not here. You know Kate? She's our smokin' hot roommate. Your roommate? This is my chalet! I paid for it! Now get out of this tub! Listen, there is this Christmas Eve party that we throw every year for the staff. If you're not doing anything you should pop by. I just hate the idea of you being alone on Christmas Eve. Well, this just so happens to be the one Christmas Eve I don't have anything. So, I'd love that. Okay. Look, let me find her and warn her that you're here. She wanted me to come alone. She is my daughter, and a surprise attack is just what she needs! Can I help? Crap. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just, uh going to go to the ladies room, if you'll excuse me. So sorry, If you'll excuse me. She's not here, that's not possible! She's got to be here! Dad? What?! What are you doing here? Kate! Katie, oh my god! Mom. Are you okay? We were so worried about you. I'm fine, Mom. Well, with you running out like that we didn't know what to think, we were scared. Alex is a cheater. There, I've said it. And I will say it again. But he will not say it or say whom because his father seems to think that you are the one with the wandering eye. Tyler! That's enough. Support and love. Yeah. Okay. It's late. And you dragged me all the way up here, now could you please find us a place to stay. Fine. Thank you. I expected so much more. So much more. Oh, Honey. Everything is going to be okay. No. He's right. I let a lot of people down. Honey, it's just you that needs to be happy with Alex, nobody else, because you're the one that's going to have to deal with him for the rest of your life. What do you mean the resort is full? So you're telling me that there are no rooms left? We are 110% full, sir, I'm sorry! Dad?! Kate. Err This is your father. Yes. Were you going to ask for his ID, too? No! No, uh, I made a big mistake. I had no idea you knew Floyd Banks personally. I am so sorry. Here's what I'm going to do. We'll send some cots over to the Honeymoon Chalet for your family and the other guests that already arrived. Cots? What other guests? Hello, Kate. Rick, I found Kate. Don't move. Hey. Hi. Are you okay? Umm, considering? No. No, no, no. I paid for the Honeymoon Chalet and I'm taking it back. It's ours now. That is the only thing you paid for. What about the food, the ice sculpture, the live band? Here's the partridge in the pear tree designer suits. We're not cheap like some people. Who are you calling cheap? Now I really think that we should get the room, because was your cheating son who started this whole mess in the first place! On the wedding day morning, even! I never said you cheated. It's okay. Alex is the most honest man around for miles. Your daughter ran out on him because she realized he was too good for her. Hey! Alex didn't cheat and neither did I. We're not leaving. I paid for the Honeymoon Chalet so that we could celebrate Christmas as a family, without you all. Get those slackers out of our room. Well funny story. They paid for the room. Oh really. And I thought you paid for everything. It was a reservation. I hadn't paid yet because we hadn't arrived. We're not leaving. We came here to have a family Christmas and that's exactly what we're going to do. Slackers or no slackers. Married or not. Kim, let's go. Rick? Alex! Can we talk later? Yeah. Someday that boy is going to grow a pair and sock his old man right in the mouth. Dad! Enough. Please? You have all done enough today. - Kate-- - Not now! Tyler. Let's go. No, no. No. Please have those cots sent out to the honeymoon chalet, okay? If that Atkins are staying, than the Paulsons are also staying. I am so sorry. Are you okay? No. My parents and sister showed up unexpectedly. Oh. I'd love to meet them. No, you don't. My dad is a fixer, and my sister is a planner, and-- That sounds fun. Do you wanna get out of here? Sure. What do you want to do? Let's do something fun. Ever been tubing? Let's do it. I'm having second thoughts. Come on, it'll be fun. I just don't like it when I can't stop. I won't let go. Okay. Promise? I promise. No! You promised! Wahoo! I'm coming! Ahh! Owe! Are you okay? Oh my gosh. Hey! Good one. You promised! I got you. Thanks. Parents must be wondering where you are. No, they're used to me running away. What do you mean? Well the first time I ran away I was 13. My dad wanted me to join the softball team and I just wanted to write. But he won and I lost, and when the first game came, I was nowhere to be found. Where were you? Funny enough, I was never very far. I just went up to my treehouse and wrote my romance novels. And when he found you? The usual lecture about how he's right and I'm wrong and he's always right and I'm always wrong. You know, he always had an opinion about the guys I've dated. So I always dated the type of guy that my dad would not like. A real, just, tug of war. Who's winning? Still tugging. You mention romance novels. What's that about? Yeah, well, being an English teacher, you know, is more financially consistent, and responsible, but I've written three. But I'm really hoping this fourth one I'm writing is the magic one that gets published. But how can you be an expert about romance when you've never really experienced it for yourself. I guess that's exactly what makes me an expert. 'Cause I'm untarnished, and I still think it's all dreamy. Romance to me is about taking the trails less traveled, and letting them help you make connections, that you would have never made before. It's about the simple things, too. A hot mug of cocoa by a warm fire. Getting reacquainted with old friends at that special time of year. It all just seems really magical to me. Do you believe in magic? Shazam. Oh, hey, please let me know if there's anything I can do to make your honeymoon more comfortable. Bar's closed, and I'm on the hunt for a bottle. Well, my shift is just about over. Want to have a drink with me? Wow, the moon is amazing! I feel like I could just reach out and pluck it. Imagine all the magical nights we could have under its spell. Tell me you don't feel anything and I will go away and never be found again. That's a bit dramatic. I figured it was fitting, considering I am falling for an English lit professor. Falling for? Yes. I had an amazing night with you. There's something I need to tell you. What? You can tell me. What is it? What? Kate! Aren't you going to introduce me? Sorry, I'm Jason. My sister, Jess. Good to meet you. Kate, Mom and Dad are looking for you. Oh, um, thanks for a great night. I know that your family's in town for the holidays, but if you have some time, the Christmas party is still on, so. Yeah, no, sure. I'll let you know. But I'd love to. Anyways, thanks. See ya She left you after finding out that you were rich? Yeah, she said that if my plan was to marry her for the cash than I should shove it up-- Yeah, yeah. I get it. Whoa. Two million dollars? Yep. Was she right? About? Your plan. I'd like to think not. But maybe. Who cares? I care. You do? It's my job to care. Unfortunately I care a lot about other people, and I'm still missing the person in my life to care about me. What's up with that? What? That hunk back there. I saw the way you looked at him and he looked at you. Is he the reason you ran? No. No. He's just nice. And you're married. Whoah, come on. That is up for debate. I never said yes. Of course you did we all heard it. You kissed him. I kissed him but I didn't say yes, I said bless. You said yes. I said bless. I am the world's worst skier. What are you doing here, then? Kate wanted this. It was her family childhood Christmas vacation destination. I, on the other hand, had Bermuda booked. Hot beaches, even hotter nights. Instead I'm up here freezing my butt off with my father looming over my shoulder. Trying to figure out if I'm even still married. Was there ever a time when you two were in love? No. I don't think so. He was just a friend and I thought that was enough. Oh, come on. You don't kiss friends. Let alone marry one. You're telling me. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Come on. No, let's go! What was that? I'm so sorry. He did cheat on you, didn't he? No, it wasn't like that. What then? Come on. Alex, I'm sorry. No, I should have told you sooner. You acted like you loved me. It wasn't all an act. Oh come on. You were going to take the cash and run away with it. I didn't know what I was going to do. I had so many people in my head bossing me around. I don't know what to believe. After that weird prenup you made me sign. I connected all the dots. And I'm not going to play your little game. I'm sorry but I don't think I was ever really in love with you. Kate, I'm so tired of my father holding this money over my head. I needed a way out, and, yeah you were my way out. You need to stand up for yourself. We both do. I wasn't going to leave you with nothing. Marriage shouldn't be anybody's way out. Kate, listen. I have a plan. Please just hear me out. All we have to do is pretend that everything's okay, just for a little bit. There's nothing he can do to stop that check from cashing. Everything is far from okay. I'll give you 10%. That's $200,000! You can take a sabbatical, travel the world. Finally write your books! Are you trying to bribe me? No. It's like a business deal but it benefits you and me! How much time do you need? Five PM Christmas eve. After that, there's nothing he can do to stop the check from cashing. I ripped up the check. And I taped it together and deposited it. Please help me. I don't want your money. You're going to pay my dad and mom the money back for the wedding, 25% interest. 25? My parents deserve a break. Fine. And, so we both feel that we need to give this marriage a try. Oh, Katie! Is that really what you want? Of course it is, he's a great catch. Is it alright if my daughter speaks for herself? Thanks, Dad. I want to give, I want to give marriage a try. It really is beautiful. Family together for Christmas. Well then. Okay, I support you. Very good choice, and taking responsibility. Here, here. Call room service and order a bottle of Christmas cheer. I need a drink. I'll drink to that. Okay! Hey, Girl. Hey. I've got to get back to the city. I have a big Christmas wedding. Thank you for coming. Kate, if you thought I bought that show in there, I didn't. We just want everyone to enjoy Christmas. No. It's more than that. Jessica, enough. Please? Look, it's none of my business. But, I am wondering what you're going to do about him. Hey, Kate! Are you hitting the slopes with your family today? Uh, yup. Great, well maybe later we can grab-- Uh, we We're busy. So, um, let's go inside. Okay, bye! Thank you! Christmas mimosas! Mmmh! You know, we should go skiing. There ya go. When's the last time I hit the slopes? Years. Uh, maybe we should take it easy. Maybe you're right. No way, Tyler. Man up and let's hit a few black diamonds. No! Not with your back. Oh, I'll be fine. Dad! Katie! Kate, can you go with them? Mom! Hey, yeah! Just the four of us. Alex, get your gear. South side has all the best runs. Double black diamond or nothing, Tyler. I like the real stuff. I can't ski this. Why are you a consistent source of embarrassment, Alex? Okay, which way? Well, the south has most of the black diamonds and the north is mostly blue. South it is. I'm going to stick to the north if that's okay. Find the bunny hill. You might get some tips on how to ski from the kids. Awesome. Hey. Sorry. I'm used to it. See you at the bottom? Sure. Becca! Hi stranger. How's that hangover treating you? I could use a drink to nurse the pain. Well my shift is just about over and the lodge is about to open. Do you want to join me? Tips up. Okay, follow me. What do you say, old man? Triple black diamond? Old man? I'm three years younger than you. Well than this shouldn't be much of a problem. Hey, Dad, don't. I heard a woman was injured on that run yesterday. Kate, I'm a bit rusty, but he's got nothing on me. Here it goes. Mayday, mayday, we've got an avalanche coming down on the south slope! You okay? You saved my life. Well thank me later. Kate's still out there. Did you see where? No. Kate! Kate, where are you?! Come on, let's go. Kate! Kate, I'm here! She's over here! Kate. She's over here! Are you okay? Kate. Are you okay? I'm I'm perfect. Still galavanting the mountain I see. Yeah. One damsel at a time. Come here. Come here. Okay. I'm fine. Okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. Can we hit the slopes? What? Let's go hit the slopes. Okay. How long was I out? About 15 minutes. We should check your head. No, I'm totally sane. No, I think you might have a concussion. We're bringing in a helicopter to fly you out. No, Jason, I'm fine. I'm just exhausted from everything, on top of the snow. No. Listen it's standard procedure. Just in case. Everything's fine. I didn't hit my head, although I wish I had. You sure? Yeah. Lee? She's denying treatment. You sure you want to do that? Yeah. I didn't even hit my head and everything works. Okay. I'll get the paperwork started. Thank you. You know, I don't usually get emotional on rescues. But when I saw you fall, I thought that I had lost something. Or everything. I know it sounds crazy, 'cause I've only known you for a couple days. But it's there. And it's real. And I made a promise to myself a long time ago, that if something comes and takes hold of me, to listen to it. You're falling for me? I'm buried. I'm damaged goods. I don't give a damn. Kate! Mom? Kate, oh my god, Dad said that you were buried alive! No, Mom. No, I wasn't! Dad! Kate. I'm fine. They said you didn't want to go the hospital. No, because I'm fine. And that is all thanks to Jason. Jason? It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard so much about you. Kate is amazing. And we've spent a lot of time together the last couple of days. You have? Well, thank you so much for saving our daughter's life. Oh, and you must be Mr. Paulson? Yes. It's a pleasure. I know this may sound a little crazy but Kate and I have been having such an amazing time together and I well I think I'm falling in love with-- Jason, no! What do you mean falling love? In love? Becca? So it was you and the runaway bride? Stop calling her that. She's not the runaway bride. Runaway bride? Alex, isn't that your wife? No! Yes! Yes. Hold on. You're married? Oh, she didn't tell you? You're nothing but a rebound. And you know what else? We are through. That's your girlfriend? No! Yeah. Two and a half years! Becca, what are you do-- You have a boyfriend? No. Not anymore. Well, this is complicated. Yeah. I knew it. I knew you were up to no good. Trying to cheat me. Oh, I told him about you trying to move in on Kate, Man. FYI, Home-Wrecker, she's married. He knows! Who cares what this slacker thinks. I want to know if this marriage was ever real. You told her about the money and then you devised this wedding. What money? What's he talking about, Kate? It's not like that, Dad. Yes it is, Tyler. These grave robbers were going to steal from my beloved mother. That's not true. Kate had no-- If you think I'm going to hand over my mother's hard-earned savings to a no-good lying weasel like you, then you've got another thing coming to you. Uhh sorry. Oh what a surprise. You missed. You know what, you really are a bully. You should be ashamed of yourself. Who talks to their own flesh and blood that way? Come on, Alex. Let's go. Maybe if he wasn't such a screw up. Rick, is this really necessary? And you. You're no better than he is. Hey, Rick. Nobody talks to my daughter that way and gets away with it. Nice job, Dad! Thanks. Should we get some ice on that, Honey? Yeah, that'd be a good idea. Should we start from the beginning? No, I can explain, Jason. When were you going to tell me? Some of it, I was going -- A revenge fling. I'm such an idiot. No, I was going to tell you that! Jason! I love you! A couple ice packs are needed. What just happened? Kate. Come on, Honey, let's go. No, Dad. I appreciate you standing up for me but I ran away because I want to be alone. And you can never give me that, so now I am telling you, to give me space, and stop chasing me! Jason! Please! I was going to tell you. It doesn't change how I feel about you. How you make me feel. Please! Here you go. Thanks. Alex? We had a deal. Yeah, until your boyfriend messed that up. Oh, I'm falling love! Oh, as if the hotel manager is any better. Nice rebound. I'm right here. Yeah, better than Jason, King of the Bunny Hill. The deal? Is off. Becca, can you give us a minute? Of course. You here to yell at me, too? Alex, please. I've been really hard on you lately. Lately? Try my whole life. Because that's the way the world is. No one's going to give you anything. You have to earn respect. You have to earn a day's wages and understand the importance of a savings. And what you and Kate were planning-- Kate? Kate didn't know anything about the money. It was my plan, not hers. Than why did she run? Frankly, Dad? Because she didn't love me. I told her about the money hoping it would turn things around, and instead she ran away. I can't believe you. The money you cost us. And Tyler. Christmas was my mother's favorite time of year. She always said that the best gifts come from the heart. I'm sorry Alex for the way I've been treating you. And you're right. It's time for you to grow up and be free. Nobody has to love me. But I don't have to live with those who can't. That includes Kate, and you, Dad. I do love you, Kid. I do. What happened to the Atkins and all those boys? Well the Presidential chalet suddenly became available and Becca moved them all there. You're joking! No. Oh, Kate. When you were little you used to run away from everything you didn't like. Remember when Dad was trying to teach you to ride a bicycle and you went and hid in the treehouse for half a day? This is a little bit more complicated. Yeah, but you're still running, and it's not a good solution! When are you going to see that? Mom, you know, you and Dad always had the perfect plan for me. Straight As in high school, best college, a solid career and then marriage. I always went along with it. I had the solid career, and then the next step was marriage to a Ken doll. So when Alex asked me to marry him I didn't say yes because I wanted to marry him, I just thought it was the next step in the plan. Oh, Honey. Look, I'm not running away. I'm running towards what I want. Well, you're still running. And he's a rebound. Maybe we should just go home. Let's have Christmas. All of us. Mom, you know what? I love you. But you didn't hear anything I just said. And Jason? He would be a rebound if I was ever in love with Alex, but obviously I wasn't. I'll give you a bit of room. Oh, you've got to be kidding me! What are the chances? Fate? Yeah. And dumb luck. Kate, you're married! No, I didn't lie! We were split up. You're still married, and for that I cannot trust you. And Becca, what about her? We broke up, she's crazy. Okay, neither of us had 'Crazy Exs,' how innocent are you now? It's a completely different level. And what about when you kissed me? That kiss? That kiss was more than just a kiss. It was passionate. It was real. And? And what? What do you want to say, Kate? Alex and I are over. What? Your chances for fortune didn't work out? I didn't know anything about that. He lied to me. And to get back, you lied to me. No! Technically, yes, I lied. And I'm sorry. There's no going back on this, Kate. You're going to have to let go. I'm getting off here. Lee to Jason. Go for Jason. We have a person down on Heartbreak Ridge. Possible broken leg. Copy that, I'm on my way. I know I shouldn't have taken it so far. It's insane, you could have a concussion. All those things I said about you? I was wrong! Jason! Jason, what are you doing? Mike could have a concussion, or worse. I'll go get some help! No it's fine, I've got it, just give me a second. Why do you always have to be a hero? Because sometimes you have to go through a little bit of pain to do what's right. Really? Kind of like how somebody has to lie when really deep down, I'm in love with you? What? Jason, I love you and we are going to go get some help and I am not going to lose you. And you know what, while we're being honest? Mike? Well, I'm not really his English teacher. What? What happened? What's going on? Mike may have a concussion. And Jason hurt his knee again. How bad is it? I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. Come on, Jason. I'm good. You okay? I can make my way down. I'll see you soon. Kate. Go away. You alright? I'm fine. I don't really want to talk to you two. Can you give us a minute, please? Of course. You alright? Do you really care? I'm sorry about everything. I've been a huge jerk. But I'm even more sorry about abusing our friendship, and hurting you. I know you never loved me, but you always cared about me. I do. I took advantage of you and I owe you an apology. I'm sorry that your plan didn't work. Well, actually. What? Here. My father never stopped the check from cashing. It's as much from him as it is from me. I told him everything, and he did something he hasn't done in a really long time. He told me loved me. And that he's sorry for how he's been treating me. Kate, I know this is crazy but thank you. I finally have a relationship with my father. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You're going with Becca? Becca, what about the lodge? I quit. I figured it was time to let someone take care of me for a change. We're going to Bermuda. Wow. Safe travels. Take care. Bye, Kate. I'm sorry, Kate, I can't let you in. Why? I don't know, but he's the patient and I've got to respect his wishes. He doesn't want to see ya. I'm sorry. Thank you. When you were a little girl, we used to drive my dirt bike out in the hills behind our house. Do you remember that? And we would spend all Saturday looking at bugs and flowers and the stars. It was the highlight of my life showing you the world. And, now, Kate sometimes dads forget that their little girls grow up. And, uh, as you know I'm not very good at letting go. I love you always. You don't need to run anymore. I am done following you. I need to spend more time at home with your mother. And I can't keep up with you anyways. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Dad? What's this? That should cover the wedding expenses, and help you save the company. I don't want Rick's payout money. It's mine. It's from me, Dad. My Christmas gift to you and Mom. I'm still selling the company. I'm really looking forward to spending more time at home with your mother. Don't spend it at home, Dad. Go and see the world. You and Mom deserve that. I love you. I love you, too. Merry Christmas. Hey! Do you know where they took Mike and Jason? Down to the landing pad. Thanks. Oh, hey! Jason gave me this to give to you. Kate, thank you for the sweet times we've had, and for rescuing me. But I still need to move on, I'm sorry. Please understand. Merry Christmas, Jason. What a day. Hey! What's wrong? Look, I'm sure you're a really nice man but what I need right now is a stiff drink and a shrink. Kate, sometimes you just have to start anew. Anew? I wish life were easier. Kate, the only person standing in your way is you. So, step out of your way, and go get him! Go tell Jason how you feel and let him know. Make him listen, and then make him believe. It's going to take some time but I guarantee you that someday soon, he will listen, and he will believe. Where's the landing pad? I believe it's two miles down the mountain. Okay. My Car. What now? Hey, the sled. Come on, let's go! Do you know how to ride this thing? What do you think, Kate? There's only one thing I know better. What's that? Who's been naughty and who's been nice. Hooya! I'm going to radio the helicopter, see where they're at. - You okay? - Yeah Yo, Jason. Thanks for helping me out. Wasn't me, Man. Kate? Little honeymoon Kate? Yeah. Huh. She's dope, Man. Okay, come on! Can't you just make this thing fly? They're horses, not reindeer. I'm sorry that I stood in your way. What do you mean? Of Kate. She's the one for you, Bro. That other guy? No. Way. He's a downer. But when Kate looks at you, it's like, someone turned on the Christmas Lights! She's all shiny and happy and it just feels right. You really think so? I know so. You know, Jason, I love you, Man. I really do. I, uh, thanks. Oh, right there! Whoah, whoah boy! Whoah! Jason, it's Santa! He brought you Kate! Thanks Santa! - It's me, Mike! Over here! - What is going on? Jason! Kate what are you doing? I thought I told Anthony to give you that letter. I came here to give this back to you. You can't. I can. You can't. Yes I can and I will. Look, I want to start anew. Anew? Over. I want to start over. How we met, it wasn't fair. And I think we owe it to ourselves to start over again. You're married. You can't have feelings for another man. I know. You're right. But I never had feelings for Alex, but I know that I have feelings for you. I know that with all my heart. And this is my romance novel, Jason, but in real life! I love you, and I have faith in us. Please, forgive me? How am I going to be any different from Alex? Come on, Dude, you two? You two boys aren't even the same species. Give Kate a chance! Kate, I've got nothing but a truck full of ski gear. Even if I wanted to, how could I take care of you? I don't care. We'll find a way. I just know that you make me happier more than anyone has ever made me happy. And I want to spend every waking moment with you. Please, just one more chance? Come on, Jason, one more chance! One more chance. One more chance, please. One more chance. Owe! Oh, I'm sorry! Are you okay? I've never been better. Let's go on a date tonight. I think I'm gonna be in surgery. Okay, well, I'll be in the waiting room. Your new owners are keeping me busy, I've gotta have time for my accounts. She is tenacious, as is her new business partner. How's the RV? Did you get the one I told you about? Oh yes, the one with all the bells and whistles. Okay, send them out. Send them out. Oh here they come! Okay, send them out, send them out. Oh no. Not again. Where is she? Hope, where's my sister? Where's Kate? Are you kidding me? No, this can't be happening. Gotcha! You! I love you! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas.
