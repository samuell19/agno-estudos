I can't believe this is happening. What are we doing in Paris? Honestly... What are we doing in this classicist, tacky park? We should go home and talk it over. I have to tell you that this whole thing was like a miracle. What if I was splitting up with Anna? Then I could say such crap. - This whole thing was like a miracle. - What do you mean, "was"? Take care. And why can't we talk things over like two normal adults? You're not angry, are you? No... It's perfectly understandable. -It'll be better this way, won't it? -Sure. Absolutely. - Take care. - Bye. No. We can't. This whole thing was like a miracle. What do you mean, "was"? - You mean it's over now? - Yes. - Why? - Because it can't go on like this. Fuck. Look, let's go home. Let's go home. Let's talk it over. Take care. Somewhere along the line it got fucked up. But where? Hi. Hi. Hi. Sweet dreams. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello. Hello. Bye. Hi. Good morning. Goodnight. Can we talk? Hi. Hi. Bye. Bye guys! Time to go. Hi. Hello. Hello. Ciao, I'm off! Good morning. Bye. Hello. Hi. Your shoelace... What was it like? - What? - Paris. What happened here? Fradi won a soccer match, then lost one. Your brother Krisztián bought a new car. Your mother and I, we bought the cemetery plot. - What? - The cemetery plot. - But for who? - Who do you think? For Brezhnev! Are you serious? That'll be your mother. Can you take it? - Hi, Mom! - Hi, Tomi! I hear you got your cemetery plots, well done! Yes, we found a really nice place. It wasn't exactly cheap, but... listen. How come you are already here? You said you'd be back next week. Right... - Yes? - Actually, Anna broke up with me, and... Let's just agree not to discuss this, all right? So... Okay. - Okay? - Fine. Bye-bye. Didn't she want to come home? - Who? - Anna. Why would she come home, Dad? She's there on a scholarship! I can't get my mind around... From the airport to the city, all you see are these ugly billboards! Look at this! Chicken breast fillet at a discount! This is what people have to see when they first visit Hungary. Don't you think that it really sucks ass? You don't see this in Paris. Or anywhere else! We're the only ones with this crap. Right, but you know... Paris was never bombed. What? I said, in World War II, Paris wasn't bombed! I just cannot understand why can't you be proud of the fact that you're Hungarian? - We're home! - Hi, Mom. - You look like shit! - Thanks. Have you been taking your pills? - Come here, you! - Hi. Look at you. - Close your eyes. Close them. - Why? Come on, please! - I closed them. - Hold out your hand. Here. Now open! - Is this... a chestnut? - A chestnut! - Why are you giving me this? - My son should always have a chestnut! Look at her! Here we are! Hi little brother. Hello! Let's put her down here. For fuck's sake, son! Oh my God! Grandpa will console you, okay? Dad! Dad! Your cigarette! She was still asleep in the car. Put that away. - He won't light it! - Where's the baby food... They never change. Way back everything was better. I mean, I think I was happy, and they were too. I'm right here! Keep going! But I just had no idea about love. Does everything slowly fade away? Tamás my boy! Shoot properly, stop farting around! Or does it all go shit in the blink of an eye? Bad Poems How much? 151/90. - That's a bit high... - Dunno, I never had this problem. Thank God, anyway... Tamás! - I won't get off. - I don't want to dance around you. Quit showing off for your girl, why don't you get off? - Cocksucker. - Who do you think you are? - What's wrong with you? - Who are you? - Get the fuck outta here! - What are you doing, you faggot? Take her away, or I'll drink her blood! You motherfucking son of a bitch! Get outta here! Sorry. - Hello? - Hi, Tomi! Congratulations! I'm sitting here with Stephan and Tomek from Chick Meat. What? I don't understand. You're going to direct the 2017 ad campaign for Chick Meat! - Viktor, please stop fucking with me. - You're on the speaker. Hello... Chick Meat? All right! The point is, they love your work, but they want to meet tomorrow. - You are the king, Tomi! - Bye, Chick Meat! Chicken breast Chick Meat - It lasts forever! Dear Chick Meat Plant, As a chicken meat fanatic myself, I am honored to be at your service to strengthen your reputation... I should write a poem to you. It's dawn... It's dawn and... What the fuck am I saying, it's not fucking dawn. It's dawn... It's dawn and silence - Hello? - Well, whaddayaknow? - Hi Bálint. - Tomi! Do you know why I'm calling you at 3 a.m.? No, I don't. Whenever I called lately, you didn't pick up. If you catch my drift. Can we talk some time other than 3 a.m.? Okay, but at least say what the fuck's going on with you? - Bye. - Wait, don't you fuckin... I'd like to ask you something, Mr. Feri. Then ask. I'm thinking about quitting water polo. And what is the question? I don't know. What are you missing, Tamás? Think you're missing out? The girls will wait. Is that what you're worried about? Nobody was waiting. I just wanted to be continually in love. But for a long time I thought it was the same as sex. Hello, children. May I have your attention please? Boys, leave the room. - Why do we have to leave? - Ábel Vértes don't talk back! - So boys shouldn't have sex education? - Ábel Vértes don't talk back. Leave! So boys shouldn't have any sex education? What's wrong there, son? It's just that some idiot came in, to advertise her pads with wings, and just because we're boys, we were deprived of that! Ábel, let's get this straight: are you upset because you don't have periods, or do you have some other problem? Then we got a short version from Miss Kati. The point is that when you put on the rubber, pull your foreskin right back because if you're careless, it tears apart when you penetrate, and you'll be covered in blood! And that was supposed to be love? If you could stop time what would you do? Who would you like to play soccer with? Viktor Orbán or Tamás Deutsch? Do you like Aerosmith? Have you ejaculated yet? Are you a virgin? No. - Where? When? - What was she wearing? Slowly I worked out that I must have had sex with someone. So I had to come up with a girl named Vivien, who I hooked up with at a camp. I don't remember why we did it in a tractor tire. But it sounded so far-fetched, everybody believed it. I repeated it so much that in the end I believed it too. And from that day, I felt like a liar, a shitbag. I am a shitbag! We'll have a good bathroom with a proper shower rose and pressure. Can you pass the shower gel, Anna? That one. The green apple. You really want to wash my hair in shower gel? - Okay, give me the other one. - Are you kidding? I'm not giving to you, because. It's shower gel. - It's not shampoo? - What do you wash your hair in? Hi, Vali. I'm your auntie, I love you. But not when you ring the bell at midnight. I'm sorry. And close the door, or you'll let the heat out. What's up with you? How did the concert go? I couldn't go because my knees really hurt. Okay. You're not doing drugs, are you? - Why would I do drugs? - They scratch themselves. Your skin is dry. Here you go. So... the thing is... I was in love. Or I am. - Bye, guys! - Bye. Zita! Hey! Why are you coming this way? You don't live around here. I want to tell you something. Okay... I'm listening. It's not easy. - Why? Are you in love with me? - Yes. I mean, no. I just... was. So... yesterday, I was still in love with you. But I'm not anymore. You are a first-class idiot. You know, you can't say such stupid things. Love is a miracle. And miracles last forever. Love is a miracle. It lasts forever. Tamás Merthner: Zita, my love My love: Zita is, was, will be. A question mark casts its shadow over all of this. But what is this homogeneous debilitation? I'm sorry, but... That's not exactly how I meant it. Maybe it should be a bit more emotional. My love: Zita is, was, will be? A question mark casts its shadow over all of this! Please... But what is this homogeneous debilitation! Hold it for a sec. You don't need to shout like that. It should come from inside. My love: Zita is was will be. A question mark casts... Dinner is on the table. - Bon appétit! - Bon appétit! So, Gazsi, what's up with the company? What company? They've stolen everything! - They'll get it back together... - The old crew are long gone... The first thing I remember about poems is not understanding them at all. No roast rib warms my mouth and platter, no child my heart, foregoing such... I had no clue why this guy was snarling shouting, crying, laughing. But I had to sit still, and pretend I understood everything. - What's up with Zita? - What do you think? Nothing is up. - Zita? - Sorry. Who's Zita? Zita... Who is Zita? He has a girlfriend! Tamás! But what is this homogeneous debilitation... Thank you. - Who are you looking for? - I'm looking for Zita. - And who would you be, Sir? - Who are you looking for, young man? - Zita! - I'm sorry, but Miss Zita is not here! Zita doesn't want to see you, Tamás! It can't be true! Zita! Zita! Zita! At least you're alive. Listen... Bálint, I'm supposed to be working. I figured you must be busy. 40 times you failed to call me back! I have to do an ad. - What's up? - Nothing is up. Nothing? Nothing. Our last phone conversation: Hi, Tomi, let me call you back, I'm driving. Bálint? Anna left me. I can't stand up. Shit, hold on... Let me just pull over here. Tomi, where are you now? In Paris, in the toilet at Orly. - Do you have your boarding pass? - Yes. Super. Now take three deep breaths. Breathe nice and slow. Pull yourself together. Get on the plane. We'll talk it over when you get home. Just get up now. Okay? Okay? Okay. So don't tell me it's nothing. Do you remember a year ago, at Dani's wedding? Yes? There was that lavender field. Problem is, I'm not even sure if there was any lavender in that field. In bloom, I mean. And... if things go on like this, I'll end up forgetting the whole fucking thing. A long time ago... I believed... that all the things I painted, they all connected, then those things became connected, and that somebody would be able to understand them. Even if I couldn't. But, of course, I longed for admiration too. That's nice. Lovely. That's nice. The composition is okay. The center is off the golden section... The surrealists did things like that... There was this Iberian painter... Do you get enough sleep? Tomi! Don't you sing? No. The tryout for the choir is today. A one-two-three-four- five-six-seven-eight! Mr. Varga! Hit the showers! Eight! Now, Mr. Merthner, on your own! Sing out like you mean it! A one-two-three-four- five-six-seven-eight! Well, I didn't get into the choir. And it didn't work out with Hanna either. But I carried on drawing. Though there was a boy who was always teasing me for that. Think you're an artist? He beat me up every afternoon at water polo practice. What's up, Mr. Artist? That's probably why I beat you up every morning. Me? We never fought. We didn't fight, but I beat you up. Tomi, don't you think I would remember that? When? Okay, drop it. It never happened. You're mistaking me for someone! It wasn't me. Okay then... - I would remember that. - Sure, then forget about it. No need to remember it. The same will happen with Anna too. Maybe that door will be all that's left. - Hello. This way please. - What are you doing? Hi, this way! - Good afternoon! - Thank you very much. I need to pee. Wait, hold on. Damn... Are you wiped out? Me too. Tell me... What do you love about me? - Well... - Okay, forget it. I think that we are like children. And we can conquer the adults. What she loves about you? Is that all you actually remember? I don't think you were in love. - Where are you going? - I've got a date. By the way, it was in bloom. - What? - The lavender. My lips were numb by the end. In one sense, Mónika was my first girlfriend. With her, everything went smoothly. Attention please. I'd like you to meet your new math and computer science teacher Ms. Lenke Hanga! You call her Ms. Lenke! - Good morning to you! - Good morning. 460... Return! 500... Graphics! And... Return! Ágota Boros! Fail! Roland Koncz! Fail! Tamás Merthner! Fail. Is someone there? - I can see someone in there! - It's me, Mónika! Just some gynecological problems! I'll go now. Okay, I'll stay here, so we don't leave together. Thank you, you shouldn't have... - There's someone else in there. - Nobody. Move aside! Come out. Open the door! Come out. Mr. Merthner! You'll both end up as bums. You wait right here! Mónika, she was a real badass. Are you crazy? How could you do this to us? Who are you? - Who are you? - Hold it right there, sir! - Calm down, now! - All right, let's go! - All right! - Calm it! Next day, she was taken out of school, and I never saw her again. What are you doing here? - I'm remembering you. - You're remembering? I was just recalling Mónika Szentirmai. I'm the one who's recalling Mónika Szentirmai. And you, too! You're from my past. I'm not your fucking past! - I didn't have such a foul mouth. - Where are you going now? Can't you tell me the lotto numbers? - Hello! - Hello! Hi! - Tamás Merthner-Merthner Tamás! - I'm Kata Gál, hi! New Hungarian talent. Come, have a seat! Does anybody want a coffee or tea, or something to eat? - Yes, I'll have a latte macchiato! - I'm fine, thank you. Can I get it with some coconut milk? No problem! Laura! Well then... Tomek? Chick meat! I don't understand. When I was 7, I had different plans. At 14, and 17. When I imagined myself at this age... Sorry... Could you repeat the question? Because I missed it. Since when? Since you came in? Hi, Dad! Dad? Hi. Hey there. Listen, fancy coming to the castle with me? Now? It's not a good time. Miracle number 1: a phenomenon set in the world of imagination that contradicts experience and the laws of nature. Have you spoken to Anna? No. Are you looking for something, or just defrosting it? - Chocolate. Is there any chocolate? - No. Oh, wait. What's in this? Lavender. Sorry. Dad, do you remember that enormous Christmas tree? Which tree? - I remember being afraid of Santa Claus. - Why were you afraid? Well... Wouldn't you be afraid, especially as a kid, of somebody who just comes into the apartment? I think what I saw then was a miracle. One moment, it was dark. Then next moment, out of the blue, I couldn't understand how a tree that big could get in. I know. You were really young at the time. Telenovela episode 127 Gáspár, please go down and buy a tree. We're way behind! First of all, we aren't behind at all. Except maybe you. I bought the tree a week ago and it's out on the balcony. Then please tell the tree that it can come inside. Vali's out with the kids and I want to light the tree when they return. Understood. Permission to submit, and to bring in the Christmas tree. - Permission granted. - Thank you. All the tree shops were closed. So I went behind the hill. I placed it on the top of the Wartburg, or, hold on... Wartburg? No, I don't know, maybe it wasn't that. What a great job they did with this square! This is where we saw Prime Minister Antall's speech. Only a fool would think that looking back into the past means that we neglect the present and fail to see the future. There is no future without the past! Our transition would not have been so peaceful... Get some water! That's what comes to mind about Hungarian politics. The way this entire Hungarian society runs, is that there are good fairies and evil witches, left and right wing, and they can't even breathe without having someone to hate! Ábel, why are you surprised? That is how they control the masses! - It has always been like this. - The fuck it has! There were periods in history, when people stood up! Ábel, you're not doing anything either! - How come you're not marching? - What's your point? Don't you guys want to go down to rehearse? Rehearse what? With the band. I don't know where my drums are. With the job, the baby, I don't have time. Right, the band, the baby, and the job are more important, but fuck, the way we live... We have an exclusive on a new band with behind-the-scenes secrets from our reporter in the field: Hello András! Good afternoon, viewers. It's hard to believe, but we're here! The only TV crew who got in. We're about to witness the formation of the band. The actual physics class is about to begin. The boys are sitting back there, and the formative moment is about happen. Guys... I've been thinking we should start a band. Every grunge musician we knew had a girlfriend, so... I thought there was some connection. Hi, I am Barbara, the new neighbor. Would you like if I sit here to do my homework? Nobody ever plays me so nice like this. But that's just two chords! Just go to your room already with your mandolin, or violin... I remember thinking that if I held down a note, I'd turn the world on its head. But what I did was switch the chords from Nirvana's About a Girl, giving the first big hit of our band which was called: Réka. We found a singer. I don't remember how she got into the band, but I remember our last gig. Réka... you poor girl! You're caught up in the whirl. Abortion... It's a tough thing. I'm rooting for you, hoping you can cope. Réka... Réka... Shit man, I paid my taxes twice! - But like, completely by accident. - You are just an idiot. Which way are you heading? That way. Ciao! Ms. Lenke! Ms. Lenke! Good evening! Hold this! It's me, Tamás Merthner, you were... You were my teacher. For math... and computer science... Chick meat - It lasts forever! Imagine a world where billboards and posters were gone, and people were not told what to do. And they would have their own thoughts. That's a whole lotta nothing. Your turn. And how do you imagine that? - What? - What you just said... I don't know. Now, listen to me. Edward the king, the English king... Vali had a quote from a poem by Arany for everything. As a kid, I was afraid of Arany: he reminded me of Stalin. Edward the king, the English king, Bestrides his tawny steed. "For I will see if Wales," said he, "Accepts my rule indeed." All right, Vali... Why listen to these stupid dead people? Even you don't give a shit what I think! Kiss my ass! I didn't mean to slam it like that. I'm sorry. That's when I started headbutting posters. It was pointless, but made me feel better. With each headbutt, I felt the universe expand an inch, while my brain was probably shrinking at the same rate. - Thank you! - What? Well, for existing. It would be so awful if you didn't. I really wanted this, but not quite this way. - It's okay. - You're drunk and... What's wrong, Tomi? Tamás... - Did he hit his head? - No. Let me see. Copy what I'm doing. All right. Say: bow-wow. A cat: meeoow! Tamás. Say it. Pay attention, son! Lips! Tongue! Behind teeth! Close teeth! What the heck is hecikumma?! Table? Hair? - "Apirga", or "apirge"? - Apirga! - Krisztián. - Leave me alone already! What? Are you seriously... Fine... Where are you going, son? Ladies and gentlemen! Allow us, to show you the moment when Tamás Merthner realizes that he's hopelessly in love with Anna Csák! In exactly 45 seconds, if our calculations are correct, it will happen between Korlát and Körmöci streets. Ladies and gentlemen, there are only 15 seconds left before his confession of eternal and all-devouring love. Hello? - Hello? - Yes? Anna? No, it's Henri. But I can give a message to Anna. Hello? - You want me to help? - No, you can't. Somebody ruined it. Ever since then the heat goes out, but what can you do? Sorry. Why didn't you tell me you've been writing poems, kiddo? I haven't really told anyone. Bring me my glasses. On the commode. Did you hang my painting? Your painting was always there, I just rearranged things. - These are all just... stupid poems. - Shut up. I'm reading. And what's the point, what's your goal with this? I haven't thought about it. But are you okay? You should send this to a newspaper. You think it's worth it? I don't know, but what's the point of writing to nothingness? Darling, can you bring me the chicken? Thank you! Chick Meat. It lasts forever! Cut. Okay, back to first position. We're doing another one. What is that? Viktor... I thought we agreed we wouldn't be using chicken. - Chicken? Where? - There dammit, we said no meat! What's wrong? Tomi doesn't want to use meat. It's not that I don't want it, we agreed not to show it. - No meat. - No meat. - Hello? - Hi, it's Anna. Henri said somebody called me. What is that noise? We are shooting. What? - We're shooting... - Shit this costume is hot! ...a kids' movie. That's cool. Listen, I just wanted to hear your voice. Who is Henri? You met him before, you just weren't paying attention. Anyway... It's okay, I mean, it's great if you have a boyfriend. Okay, look, I have to go. You have to go? Where? Fuck, you always "have to go"! Fine, bye! Which one should it be? Dear Sirs, My name is Tamás Merthner, I'm a 17-year-old high school student. - Write it down! - Right, sorry. I would be honored if you would read some of my poems, enclosed here in the hope that they might be of interest to you for possible publication in your periodical. Sincerely, etc. You need to type it up to make it look nice and official. And it should be signed! - So sign it. - You're here, too! Great. - Hi. - Hi. This again? - Yes, again. - But what for? - I thought... for the vitamins. - I can't eat. Tamás! You're going to be late! When is your next match? - Saturday, at three o' clock. Bye now! - I'll make a note of that. - Dad? - Yes? Could you, maybe, not come to the game? - Is it a girl? - No, but... It's just, none of the parents come to the games anymore. All right. Then I won't pencil it in. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Tamás! I gave the nurses some money. And we'll have to thank Dr. Kis Szabó... I think it's good that she stays there. They'll examine her there. It's a good place with more nurses. Maybe we should take her a book. Do you know what she likes to read? Vali can't just die. She's very strong. Welcome to everybody here. The grieving family, friends, colleagues. Today we pay our respects to Valéria Bán, or as everyone knew her: Vali. A few more scenes! Then the curtain comes down. The light's snuffed out. Applause and whistles are no more. A few more scenes, then it's over. Now, please join me with Vali on her final journey. - Hello? - Good afternoon... - I just... - Yes? I just called to tell you... You are a wonderful person, and a beautiful individual. You are a wonderful person, and a beautiful individual. A wonderful person, and a beautiful individual. Finally, a jacket, a suit! You're dressed like a real man! I'm just going to the ad agency to sign a contract. Excellent! - 14-year-old preserves from the cellar. - And this? Those are just poems. I wrote them when I was courting your mother. So? - It's really nice. - Really? You only wrote one? - What are these? - Titles. For a year. You wrote the titles? - But no poem to go with them! - All right! Get a tie! - I will not. - Just get a tie. Do it! These people will overrun Europe entirely, and they will be here in Hungary as well, then you can go buy a prayer rug. Whatever they say on TV, that's just the sacred truth. Do you really think we are stupid? That's what you think of your father? ...more radical than Islam. We didn't go to them! They are coming to us! Do you know that 50% of the kids in German kindergartens are not German? I know, because you tell us several times a week, whenever we speak! So how come you're not worried about your own child? Vali... Didn't you say that love is a miracle that lasts forever? I never said anything like that. I would never say such hogwash. Son, don't you have an opinion about this? You just sit there, while the child cries! Are you provoking him? Should he take your side? Let's just go! Let's go. There's still cake! Please sit down! Tamás! Tamás! Just do your best! - We're proud of you, Tamás! - Button your jacket! We're proud of you! - Hello! - Hey everyone! - Congratulations! - Fantastic contracts! Really great! Look over the contract. A minimum of five ads for at least one year. One year, two, there is more to come! We'll see. So... Can I take a quick run to the restroom? I'll be quick. What are you doing? I don't know. I'm doing what I have to do. What is all this? This is an ad agency. The toilet, to be precise. What is that? - It's a hand dryer. - Are you messing with me? Advertising? Ads are things that we use to present other things in a better light in order to sell them... So you're lying? - I'm not, it isn't a lie. - Yes it is. Why the fuck are you at an ad agency? - Well... I'm trying to make money. - Did you at least join the polo team? What polo team? He's the one who quit! Right, it was fucking pointless. Yes, because I was a mediocre piece of shit in the pool, that's why... Who's this guy? - Well... My idol. - See? That was my idol! He's doing something he loves at least. First of all, he's an imaginary guy. And he's from an era when everyone killed themselves, even the roadies. Did you ever paint that "big painting"? No, because there's no such thing as "the big painting" or dreams. At least I wrote 100 poems to Zita Schneider. And who read them? Nobody gives a shit about poems! I don't want to become like you. I'm sorry, but it's gonna happen. The reason I'm in this fucking place, is because you wrote poems, you always daydreamed, and played water polo for no reason! I'm only here because you all sucked! - Sorry. - It's okay. Here, please. And sign every page. Here are the new designs if you have a minute. Look at that! Invert Chick! That's so cool! It's good that it's matt. That's cool... I don't want this. What? What? I'll write her a poem. It's dawn and silence. I've lost my license. Just a moment. Sorry. As quick as you can, please. You have to help me. I'm in Paris, and I need your help. It's absolutely vital. If it's so vital, then say it. Yes, well, the thing is... Get yourself... Now? Are you shitfaced? You said it was vital! Yes, it is vital! Because it is! You might not get it, and no, I'm not drunk, I'm completely fine, I'm here in a fucking hotel and I need you. Hi there. Hey, I got your box right here. Along with my ticket. Fucking awesome! Yes, it was actually quite cheap. But I have to return in two hours. That's great! I'll pay for your ticket. Forget it, just be at the airport by 4 P.M. I have to catch the return flight. Okay. - I love you! - Love you too! Shit! - Hello? - Finally. Fuck. Where are you? In Budapest, at the ER. There's been a bit of an accident. - Jesus, are you all right? - Yeah. Now, listen to me: I transferred the ticket to your Dad. He might be there already, call him. You did what? My father? Fuck, the last place my father traveled was Yugoslavia. And by the way, your father thinks that he's bringing medication. Medication? Your blood pressure meds. I had to tell him something. Are you out of your mind? You must be! Your friend comes and tells me that I must fly at the last minute... - Where are you? - I'm here. - Where is here? - This sign says 'Entrée.' - I'm on my way! - But I'll miss my flight back. Wait there, Dad! Wait for me! I'm at the other terminal! Hello, Son. I put down your package. You can't do this to me, Son! Hello? Hello, Dad? They closed down this whole area. - They think it's a bomb. - But I just put it there! They don't wonder whether or not it's a bomb, they just close it off! Did you tell them it's your blood pressure meds? No, I didn't tell them! It's not my meds. It's lavender. What? Lavender for Anna. Lavender? For Chrissakes, you guys... Good afternoon. Let me call you back. With my son. Dad! Daddy! I'm Hungarian! Dad! Come with us. Let's go!
