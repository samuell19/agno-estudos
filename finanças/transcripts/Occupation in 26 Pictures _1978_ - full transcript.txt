Produced by: JADRAN FILM - CROATIA FILM ZAGREB - CROATIA OCCUPATION IN 26 PICTURES Directed by: LORDAN ZAFRANOVICH Written by: (singing Croatian love song) Starring: Go to sleep now, little sister. And where are you going? The carnival has just began for us. Adios, my troubadours. Niko and Miho... Let's sing the song "Old Friends". For Ane. (nostalgic Croatian song about a friendship) Ane! Close that window. A cold air is blowing in. What was that, I wanted to do? Oh, yes... I'm going to take a pee. Ane! How many times I've taken a pee tonight. I wouldn't know, GrandPa. I didn't count. One, two, three... Seven. And once before, I was able to do other things... ...seven times a night. Pina! My beautiful Pina! What a beautiful voice. And I haven't been with him, yet. He's been talking that you're giving him the lectures. Yes, but that goes for his father! If your father, senor Baldo, hasn't been my customer... ...my store would have bankrupted, by now. Miss Pina! - Mhm? What can we get for this? Hm. For this? You can only take my panties off. Go for it, Miho. Hold this. But she has no panties. Making fools of us, huh? You beast! - All right, Tony. You can watch me climbing the stairs. Squat down, Pina, please. Squat down! Pina! That's it! No more, without money. It's all over now! Open up, Pina. I've got the money. What can we get for this? - Oh! For this much... ...you can get this! - Oh! Oh! Heavens! Don't bite! Who's that... Get out of here, Jewish bastard! Get out of here, bastards. No more without money! Get out of here! I'll get you! Pina! My beautiful Pina! - You jackass! You are the true love of my heart! Bastards! All right, boys. Get ready. We will enjoy in the combat skills. The style of running, shows our individualities. You have noticed my special style of running. Be faster than any other. Fast and joyful! Mr. Miho... I'll practice with you. Hop! Hop! Move your legs, please. Move your legs. And now, show us what have you learned from my lectures. Attack and defend. Starting position! Forward! What's wrong with you, Mr. Hubicka? That was not a proper stroke. This noble discipline, ...implies a certain high sense of honor. But... Not that everyone has it. Sometimes even the whole nations. Like Jews, for example. Whereas, with the pure Aryan race, ...that sense is too much expressed... ...together with a strong combat spirit. Come on, young master... ...pick up your saber. Starting position! Come on. Attack! Attack like a snake! Forward! Aha! What's going on here!? Is that Ane, huh? I've caught you now! - I didn't do anything to her. I swear. - Good for you. I'm watching you and do not do that again. We will be engaged, Niko, as soon as father returns. What? For him? For this Italian Casanova? How would you engage him, when I'm going to stab him right now. Let's have a duel. Come on. - Disturbing lovers, like that. Now, you'll pay for this. We won't be chasing whores together, any more. And now I have to stab you. You could do that, only if I cross my arms. Watch out! These are my deadly strokes. You jackass! You've grown so big! How come you're so handsome? - I resemble my father, whom else? Why didn't you let us know that you were coming, Papa? You should have anticipated that. What a nice surprise, my Baldo. Ane and Tony will be engaged. We waited for you to celebrate. How many people still remember me in Chile and Argentina... ...from my seaman days? - Papa, I've arrived from Venice. - From Venice? Have you sailed by Maestral or Tramuntana? It is a great turmoil in Italy. Merchant ships are used for other purpose now. A war is imminent, Papa. A war? War. La guerra (war). I don't know, Ane. I'm not against it. Going into engagement, these days, may be wrong. I wouldn't want you to make a mistake. It may turn out good, Papa. Especially if fianc?es are in love. The Ministry has dissolved the URSA organization. And the police has searched the URSA Syndicate headquarters. Our assets have been confiscated. They have printed posters in which they appeal to Croatian patriotism. To gather contributions for unemployed workers. All of the sudden, they show their concerns about the workers. Croatian bourgeoisie wants to present their fake concerns... ...and workers as their obedient and loyal followers. But, we are sending them a message: Masters, we do not need your fake concerns! We need a syndicate organization, which you have just dissolved. That's right! We are organized not only in Dubrovnik, or Croatia, or Yugoslavia. But in the worldwide Internationale with 80 million workers. Beware, comrades! Croatian bourgeoisie is preparing a noose for our neck. Stay in touch with your worker's leadership, ...because in the case of war, ...the workers and peasants will defend the country, while... ...the masters will collaborate with the enemy. - Police constables! Stiyepo, my father has arrived. Oh, my master Baldo! I'm coming right away. - Did we achieve any goals with our strike, huh, Marash? Masters in Dubrovnik were scared to death. They all think that revolution has started. I hear that master Baldo has returned. What is he saying? I mean, are we going to a war. Listen, Marash... Even if a war breaks out, Dubrovnik would remain free, like before. Do you know who would be the first to suffer? Me and this poor folks. You, rich people would be fine. You wouldn't loose a single hair. Give him my regards, young master. I was working for him on a ship. And if a war breaks out... ...I know whose neck to strangle first. Bourgeois would be hung all over Pale. Luce, we have a great celebration in our house. Mara, will help you. You couldn't do it alone. Adio. - Adio. Tell master Baldo that I would like to see him. Adio, Mara. And these are my ancestors. This is my grand grandfather. The last admiral of our glorious Republic. And this is his uncle. Reverend Jero. - Mhm. We have always been seamen, but in every generation, ...we had a preacher to bless our navigation. What an honorable family, master Baldo. Now our families are closer. It will be easier through hard times. Friendship is fundamental. What do you think, captain Baldo? There is not much choice left, for us, people of Italian descent. Justice is always the right choice, master Paolo. Ah, here it is! Sit down. How are you, master Pasko? I do not like this song, Mr. Hubicka. Remove it, please. But this is listened all over Europe. - I know that, Mr Hubicka. But our songs will be more appropriate for this day. Fine. Looks like Mussolini. God forbid! Attention! My Ane. This is beautiful. What a beautiful music. Help yourself. - Thank you. What a beautiful day. I hear some noise. What is this? - I don't know. Just like the great earthquake 1667. On the same day. Stay calm and without panic. Let's go in the basement. Jesus and Mary! We lost the lunch. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! I am the mayor of the city. - Hm. And you are really glad to see us? Any nation is glad to be... a part of the Third Reich. Please, be my guest for a dinner. - With pleasure. Please. Wonderful! What a great culture! So many churches in this little town. No wonder, Sir. Those are our watchtowers. We were building churches, while others were building dungeons. Our motto is: "Battle of spirit against a brute force"! This is the sacred soil! The sacred soil! The sacred soil of Italy! The sacred soil of Italy! (Italian fascist music in the background) Ragusa has been liberated! (Ragusa is Dubrovnik in Italian language) Italian soldiers! You are the liberators. With your heroism and your blood... ...you have written a page in the epic... ...of glory and victory. There are no obstacles to your courage! Duce! Long live Duce! (cheering to Mussolini) Mr. general, allow them to change the march. No! This is the order from Duce. They shouldn't have dispersed the soil. Which they brought from Mlyet. It has screwed them just fine. (Mljet - Croatian island near Dubrovnik) You're gorgeous, Ane. How are you feeling? - I'm so happy. Put that black hat on, please. Come on, Niko. What are you waiting for? The curfew is on. It is forbidden to go out after 9 P.M. Not for me. I have an invitation for the reception. I've received it, too. But I wiped my butt with it. What the hell would you do among fascists? Just for a little entertainment, Pa. - Eh, my son... These times are not for an entertainment. You're so beautiful! My Russian soul is opened for everyone! Except for Jews and communists. For Duce! Hail Hitler! Hail! Hail! Ladies and gentlemen! I do not like you to think that we occupied your country. If you continue with that, we will not become friends. I keep writing, sort of a diary. In fact, those are letters to my mother. Today, I've written: "Dear mother..." "Occupation is my desire for a friendship." Very nicely said. Very nicely. For Hitler! Enough! Go away! (German love song) Alessandro Del Marco. What a culture, huh, Tony? He looks so good in that uniform. Fits him like a glove. Wouldn't you say, Mr. Hubicka... ...that general has a slightly short legs. He is here on a special mission. He was sent by Duce himself. Pity that he has short legs. General Del Marco... What nation do you hate the most? - Serbs. Yesterday you were among the Serbs... ...and you were asked the same question. Your answer was: Croats! - Exactly! Mama! - Come here, my dear. General Del Marco, ...participant in the campaign to Rome, ...close friend of Duce, ...hero of Ethiopia, ...hero from 3 wars... It is my honor to touch you! - Thank you. You, Italians in this country, you are descendants of Dante. You are the flower of our nation, which will ennoble this ancient city... ...with fascistic culture. Look at reverend Djivo. He really enjoys the food. Isn't it time for the fast, rev. Djivo? - Oh! Niko! I haven't seen Baldo here today. He's never present when "our people" get together. Even little children are happy because this glorious city... ...has been re-joined with the "mother"... ...Independent State of Croatia. Isn't it a beautiful sight? Allow me to present you, our reverend. What an idealist. God almighty has sent you to us. Thus answering to the centuries-old desires... ...of the Croatian people for the independence. Admiral Semyon Chebutkin! Decorated with the Medal Of Honor from the "White Eagles". Aspirant of the Tzarist Russia, participant in the battle of Tsushima. Professor of the military-naval strategy... ...at the Military-Naval Academy of Dubrovnik. Together we went through the horrors of Bolshevism. He saved me from that hell. Leave the horrors behind, Madam. Let's be happy! Bravo! A dance for the general! I am father Tikhon. Since the Bolsheviks came to power, I lost my speech. I've got difficulties to pray to God. But you still pray from time to time. Very seldom, dear Sir. Even God has given up from us Russians. Friends! The world must support Hitler! So, that he could punish Bolsheviks. You see what the Poles have done? They have resisted. What do you think, Mr. Hubicka? As the chief of military-political censorship... ...do you think that the occupation suppresses the human rights? On the contrary, Madam. This people has too much rights. I read in the newspaper, that in the town of Split, ...they threw a handgranade at the Italian orchestra... ...while they were playing "Giovinezza". That is our Balkan culture: Throw a handgranade at the orchestra. At the art! And here in the heart of Dubrovnik, Jewish shops are still opened. Not to mention the communists, who are freely walking around. When I hear the word: communist, I get epileptic seizures. Here! Here! That is true. Turn off the light. We are going to watch the victories of the glorious Italian Army. Ragusa has been liberated! Long live Italy! Viva Italia! Viva Duce! This ancient Roman city of Saint Vlaho, is free! Long live Italy! Long live Duce! Long live Italy! Long live Duce! Italian soldiers! You are the liberators. With your heroism and your blood... ...you have written a page in the epic... ...of glory and victory. There are no obstacles to your courage! (singing Italian fascist song "Giovinezza") Ane, you are drinking too much. - Shht! Are you proud to be a descendant of this brave Italian armada? Niko, let me sing the song! How was the party at Nina Andreyevna? Who was there? A scum from all over the world. Even the reverend Djivo is there. In order to bless them. Just like he sang cantata for the Poglavnik. (Poglavnik = President of Independent State of Croatia) Where is Ane? He has stayed with Tony. I felt sick about all that. And now I have to go to the club's ceremony, with all of them. Do you have to go? No, but look what is written on the invitation. "If you do not come, we will consider that you do not accept... ...the membership under new conditions." The consequences would follow. - What should I do, Pa? It would be better if you go. That way, you won't be suspicious. Ane is still out. We will wait for her. Here you are. Good bye. - Good bye, general. Good night. Good bye. Papa! Do not bring... ...the fascistic stench here. You will be sorry for this, Mr. Baldo. Ane, if you feel nauseous, throw up. You would feel better. Enter, please. Enter. You can not enter. - Why, Mr Hubicka? Leave your equipment in the club. You are not doing well, young master. How come that he is not doing well, Sir? Miho is one of the best in the club. Eh, my gentlemen... Criteria have been changed now. We have new regulations according to the new conditions. Consequently, a revision of the membership has been made. Please, be so kind and... ...read what is written on the door. ENTRANCE IS FORBIDDEN TO JEWS AND DOGS Niko! But you have no worthy opponent here. I would like to duel with him, Mr. Hubicka. Come on, lad. Start! Strip your clothes off! Great idea, my dear. Boys. Fight naked to the waist. Stop! You were good. I'm opening the house of love. Please. Independent State of Croatia, thinks about its workers. A regulation has been brought, in order to guarantee minimal wages... ...for the workers and employees. The wages, of us dockers, are regulated, as well. Workers! Join our Ustasha worker's organization. They would give you crap! They do not give even the I.D. cards to workers, to buy bread. That's right! Do not join their organization! They would suppress us there. Fuck their Ustasha leadership! Arrest him! He is a communist agitator. What a nice surprise, Mr. Baldo. I've been attracted by the smell of bread. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Please do not mind our humble home. You will be more comfortable here. Here they are, Papa. These are the builders that you are looking for. The best builders in the town. Only Vuko is missing. - Welcome, captain Baldo. Now you see where we live. For whom do you knit all these gloves, Slave? For the fighters, my master. What a pretty sight. Workers and masters sitting together around the same table. Well, captain Baldo... It becomes more and more difficult to hold meetings in our houses. We have only a dozen places in the city, where we feel safe. We could use the job on your house for our meetings. You wouldn't be under suspicion, since you are not a communist. Good. It's not of my concern whether you are builders or communists. As long as the job is going fine and on time. The wine is good. Thick and strong. - Homemade from Pelyeshats. Who is responsible for the leaflet from the County Committee? - Niko. That is his first task. We have to define members for new tasks. Dome! You looked beautiful among those clowns, at the reception of Italians. Remain among them. Be there when they listen to the news... ...and raise the flags. And keep that costume on forever. There will be a ceremonial parade in a couple of days. With participation of Ustasha's elite troop "Roynitse" and Ustasha's Youth. We should "hail" them, Mara. To show people that there is a resistance. But I wouldn't know how. That would be difficult, Ivo. Our organization is not strong enough. I hope that you're not an opportunist? - It's not about that, Ivo. Individual action could harm the organization. Yes, but their organization. We should start to stir things. If only one man resists, the entire regime would be shaken. You are under my command in this Communist's Youth (SKOJ) group. You will know only the members from this group. You must not divulge that you belong to SKOJ. If they arrest you... ...you would be tortured until you denounce your comrades. Are you sure that you can withstand that? Yes. Pero! Do you have a gift for our new comrade? Those who carry firearms, will be sentenced to death. Take care, son. S-t-e-i-n! Hello, son. You have received a copy of new law, ...brought by Ministry Of Interior, ...which regulates the procedure about... ...Jewish and Serbian shops. Jewish and Serbian shops will get a commissioner. We have been lucky with this man. And this is the list of the goods which you have to consign. Rich shop! And all things which you've got on you. - Tony! May I keep this watch? It's a very dear memento. Give it back! Listen, Miho! You know... We all have our duties. My father is in "Dopo Lavoro". My 2 younger sisters are in "Balillas". And I am an official "Gilla". You know... Italy will remain here. In accordance to the law about racial affiliation. You know, Miho... I'll take care of it. God is my witness, I will. (singing a Croatian nostalgic song) What a beautiful song! - Yes, beautiful song. It's our old Croatian song! Nice song nevertheless. Ane is waiting for you in the room. What's wrong, Ane? I've left my family. I'm pregnant. Ane. Does you father know? - No. I haven't told that to my folks. Ane... ...carries my baby! Oh, my dear! Love, giving birth, ...strengthening a family... These are the sacred things of our Order. In honor of Dante's descendants! A little music. My darlings! Now we fertilize! Our semen is highly priced now! Radio news! Ustasha's Croatia, hails all sons in the homeland. Hail Poglavnik! In Zagreb, death penalties were carried out for persons... ...who spread the leaflets with communist content. State of Croatia deeply regrets to inform you about a crime... ...which happened last night. One German soldier, one worthy life, ...has been killed by forces of darkness. Two other German soldiers were badly injured. That was the seventh attack on our German friends in Zagreb. Independent State of Croatia proclaims a day of mourning. He is with us! Endless columns of brave German troops, ...march near fields of Ukraine... ...in their rapid progress to the East. They win victory over victory, against 2 worst enemies of humanity: Capitalist England and Bolshevik Russia, ...are standing before the inevitable collapse. Soviet soldiers are surrendering. Hundreds thousands of POW... Lies! These are all lies! Down with traitors! Down with fascism! Long live the Communist Party! Long live Soviet Union! Moscow mercenary! Damned communist! Let's separate! Oh! Where are you going, Niko! You, beautiful lad! Good afternoon, Mr. Hubicka. How is your father? Tell Mr. Baldo... ...that we are thinking of him. I could cut your balls off, with a single move! Your beautiful communist balls! They are coming for me. I am with you, Sir. I hate Jews and communists. - What is he saying? Back off, preacher! You were preaching in Russian language, here in Dubrovnik. You are an orthodox Bolshevik agent! Excuse me. This one goes with us! Let's go! Come with us! We would need some music! Jews! Step forward! Come closer. Come on. We are going to a trial. Our guilt has not been proved. Haven't you read the proclamation brought by Municipality of Dubrava? Here it is, for all to hear. All Jews and Serbs, ...regardless of their religion, ...who would be arrested, ...would be sent to a forced labor camp immediately. In the case of even the slightest resistance... ...they will be immediately put on trial, ...in accordance with Ustasha's Court Martial law. I will awake him. Play the accordion! Lord, save us! Son, try to escape. My God... ...why have you forsaken me? My Lord! My Lord! Why have you forsaken me? Who are the Croats here? I am a Croat. But I'm not with you. Bastards! What's wrong with you? Why are you saying this? Jesus! Let go! Can we carry over their remains? The bodies were pulled out from the sea by Italians. But the prefect does not allow to transfer them in the city. Says that they are not worthy to be buried in our cemetery. I wish I was taken with them. Calm down, Maria. You will stay with us. Now Italians turn out to be our saviors. They have caused all this. What a fine saviors, they are! They start quarrels between Croats and Serbs. Then they give arms to both parties. And when blood starts to flow, Italians come as saviors. That is their fascistic morality! In a case of a police raid... This is the exit. It leads to the shore. Run to the shore and pray to God. Let's start, comrades. 7th partisan's regiment has been founded. We already have one company incorporated... ...in Southern Herzegovina regiment. Vuko! You must join partisans tonight! You know that fascists are hunting you. I'll come along, in a few days. That's it. Stiyepo will become a new secretary of the committee. All right. I understood, Vlaho. Errr... Well... I would like to discuss the question about captain Baldo. I think that we should not hesitate about him. We are witnessing the treachery of Croatian bourgeoisie. By becoming a member of Communist Party... ...he would distanced himself from that treacherous class. I have a different opinion. I would say that it's too early to receive masters in the Party. Everyone is a master for himself, Vuko. Everyone is judged by his doings. All right, then. Let's hear from captain Baldo. Niko, tell your father to come in. We have always been thinking that our grandchildren... ...would start the revolution. But, as you see... We will have that honor. Niko has told me. Friends! Do not accept me as a revolutionary. Because I'm not that kind of a man. Every revolution asks the same question over again: What is a human being? And what is the meaning of a human life? And now I can accept that. When there is a matter... ...to become a different human being. This evil around us... ...is deeper than the politics. A COMMUNIST AGENT PROVOCATEUR WAS EXECUTED BY A FIRING SQUAD A communist agent provocateur Ivo Buchich... ...was executed by a firing squad. He was 20 years old. He had been yelling: "Down with fascism! Long live Communist Party!", ...during the radio news listening... ...on the Square of Doctor Ante Pavelich in Dubrovnik. Court Martial in Zagreb, sentenced him to death... ...on 5th day this month. He was executed the same day by a firing squad. Proclaimed by the Ustasha's camp in Dubrovnik. Niko, take Grandpa for a walk. It's Papa's turn today. That's right, Niko. Bring me a scarf for Grandpa. It's chilly outside. What a beautiful night, Grandpa. Like we are not under the occupation. Yes, indeed. Baldo! - Hm? Where are we now? Just in front of the house. All those windows are yours. My God! It's almost 9 P.M. The lights must be turned off. Sea! Sea! Sea! Sea! Papa! Take it easy, Papa. Baldo! We have come far from the house. Captain Baldo, come with us! - What for? Tony, where are you going, huh? Baldo!? Baldo! Can I take my father to the home? - Nothing! Get in! Did you say, Mr. Baldo, ...that female Ustasha Youth... ...smell of sweat... ...after the parade. Yes, I did. Did you say that such a stench, can not be washed away? Yes, I did. Did you say, Mr Baldo, ...that Italians have occupied our country? Yes, I did. - Hm? For heaven's sake, master... ...for all other normal people, they are considered as liberators. And you said that they have occupied our country? I don't understand. I'm not going to move a little finger for him! He is a communist! An antichrist! An atheist! Do you know who are communists? Criminals who meet at night in a sewer! They spit on the crucifix. They eat meat on Good Friday. My wife is sick. Help me, reverend Djivo. Lord, please don't let her die! (Prays in Latin) This is against my beliefs, but... I'm obliged by our old friendship. I'm coming here to tell you... ...that you will be able to see captain Baldo in 15 minutes. Be in front of Carmine. They are taking him away with a group of communists. Tell us, Mr. Hubicka... What will happen to my father? There are camps. Lipari, Mamula, Moleta... ...Udine, Shibenik, Parma... But if they prove that he is a communist... Hm... He would be shot to death. Baldo! Baldo! Baldo! Baldo! Baldo! Ustashas planned to kill us during the night. I think of Baldo. What will happen to him? - Mother! Be strong. You will be in a refugee camp on the island. You'll be safe there. At least for some time. What is it, Mara? I've waited for your mother to go away. Some of our comrades tried to escape from the bus. What about my father? - He tried it, as well. He jumped in the sea. Italian soldiers started to shoot... ...and killed him. The sea is a tomb of my family. Niko! Do you know what am I looking at now? This face of a young master, becomes coarser and coarser. And these hands are like the hands of my father. Worker's hands. This belongs to me now. Look! Look! Just look at it! You look surprised. I'm not a dear guest to you. I don't like to see you. Sit down, Niko. You are in my house now. What do you mean by that, Tony? From now on, this here is my house. You have to leave Dubrovnik. There will be more arrests of communists... ...and their supporters. The words of Duce, are being put into action: "Who is not with us, will get a bullet." And, as far as I know, Niko... ...you are not with us. Are you thirsty, boys? - Yes, like sponges. Niko, serve them with wine. How is Ane? Is she all right? She's not feeling good. She's not good since the death of captain Baldo. She wants us to live here and I indulge her. I couldn't have done anything for captain Baldo. You knew your father and how stubborn he was. Let's not talk about that, Tony. Have a drink. Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Give me your hand. "Who is not with us, will get a bullet!" For the eternal Italy! For the victory of fascism! It's nice that we are together again. How come that you are still alive? By a miracle, Tony. I've started to believe that Jews are saved only by a miracle. Let's have a drink. Huh? We could fry some fish. I think, it would be better if we roast them on the grill. I'll help you. You know that I'm the best with it. Yes, you are, Miho. But I'm not allowed to eat with the Jews. I'm going to get my things. - What? Wouldn't you wait for your sister? She would be sorry if you go before she comes. Play our song "Old Friends", ...before I arrest you. (nostalgic song about a friendship) Translated to English, by Quigley (Croatia) May 2010
