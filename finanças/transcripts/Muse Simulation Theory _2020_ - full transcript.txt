Good evening. This is Thomas Williams at V1 Studios with breaking news. Across the globe there have been reports of small tremors and power outages all centring from a single point of origin in London. We go now to our affiliates on the ground in London to find out more. Thanks, Thomas. We are now outside the arena, where it is very quiet compared to the chaos that was reported only hours earlier. We have received hundreds of reports of flashing neon lights in the sky only moments after power outages occurred across the city. Officials have given no answers, but it is clear that it is centred here, where the military are now focusing their efforts to set up some kind of investigation. We will continue to report any updates. Get ready. We're close. Oh, my God. Central, we've located the energy source. Do you feel that? Yeah. Murphy, take the lead. We got your six. Copy. I've never seen EMF and radiation levels this high. Infrared and motion are spiking too. Central, we have reached the target. Permission to proceed? Permission granted. Proceed with caution. Copy that. Let's go. Anyone have a visual? Nothing. It's freezing up here. We've got movement at 12 o'clock. Murphy, do not engage. This is incredible. That is a direct order. It's... It's an arcade console. Anyone got a quarter? Something's wrong. - What happened? - Are you hearing this? Someone grab him! - Are you hearing this? - Murphy! The sound... The sound... Oh! The sound! It's getting louder! Murphy? Help me! What the fuck? So many people. Who are they?

There's been an incident. It's Murphy. He needs immediate treatment. It's too late to save him. But he can be of greater use. Bring him in for extraction. Loading the extraction. Put him on the table. Quick, get his hands! I'm trying. Oh, my God. Almost ready. We don't have much time. Murphy, stay with me. We're losing him! OK, we're up and running.

The infection is spreading. And now the disinformation has begun. We have gained access to the arena where we believe all of these rumours began. The entire city has ended its lockdown, as official word has been received that the virus was in fact a hoax and that people are free and safe to leave their homes. This has not stopped a growing number of protestors from rioting in the streets as they attempt to siege the arena. As you can see behind me, radicals are demanding answers for the thousands of people they claim missing after tonight's false reports. They've been lying! They're lying to us!

I'm not sure. I kind of feel like I don't even know what the truth is any more... more... more... more. Do you? I do know that we have been lied to and manipulated for too long. Far, far too long. I'm sick and tired of it, goddamn it. We hide in our homes, scrolling through feeds of other people's fantasy made-up lives, while the algorithms give us bite-size information tailored to what corporations, lying politicians and foreign powers want us to see and believe. We've blindly clicked 'Accept' to their terms and conditions too... too many times. And now we are owned. We have been reduced to nothing more than data to be bought and sold to the highest bidder, so they can sell us more crap we don't need, make us angry at things we never cared about. We've turned into consumption machines, d-d-destroying each other and the only planet we have. Whatever happened to human dignity and privacy? We thought we had escaped into our own quiet little world. But no. No, they had to invade our minds. They wanna control and manipulate the entire reality. But I have to wonder, who are "they"? Is there even a "they" any more? Maybe the algorithms and AI have become the new "they", and maybe they now control us and manipulate us. Well, they know us better than we know ourselves. We-we-we have to wake up. It's time to wake up! Wake up, people! Wake up! Don't just sit there watching! Do something! This is our last chance to take back control before it's too late. ♪ ♪
