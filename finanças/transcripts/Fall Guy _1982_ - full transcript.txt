It can turn false love into the real item. Of course, it can easily change day into night as well. Good morning. Okay! This is it! Ready! Action! The imperial guard is fighting the Ronin samurai! Stop it! Who do you think I am? I am ryoma sakamoto! A hick samurai like you could never kill me! You idiot! Don't you realize... That if I die, Japan will belong to england? Is that what you want? Samurai, sir - nice-looking girl. Do you know how to kiss? Kissing feels real good. You bastard! You still want to fight, you dogs of the shogunate? Tachibana's getting another close-up. And he's even kissing the new girl. - How many close-ups does that make? - Ten. - And for me? - Only seven. Damn it! He must have bribed the director. - Well? - Okay. Bring us down. Sakamoto's duel with hijikata is next. Mr. tachibana has a 1v show. He can only stay 10 more minutes. I khow! Sorry to keep you waiting. Hurry it up! He made me wait and now he says to hurry? You're in the scene with me next, right? Listen. But the director won't - idiot! It's my movie. He can't have more close-ups than me. We don't have much time. Let's do it! Tachibana and gin-chan, do it like we rehearsed. F1lming! Ready! Action! Wait a minute. What's all this fuss? You! From the imperial guard? That's right. Imperial guard? That's right. Indeed! You're overacting. - Get in there! - But this is his moment! Get in there, you idiot! You're the famous imperial guard? Yes, indeed. I'm toshizo hijikata, second-in-command of the imperial guard. Sakamoto! It I were you, I wouldn't push my luck here in the capital of Japan. Or shall I kill you, to halt the arrival of a new era called meiji? That bastard! He's hogging the shot! Sakamoto, I demand your answer! What's going on? Need to change film. But I'm absorbed in my acting! Don't be so cheap with the film! You call yourself a toei cameraman? We need more film because your crappy acting is taking too long! What did you say? Quiet! Director. Time's up. I'm going. - We aren't through yet. - I know. I'll arrange my schedule. 1 don't want to be in the same shot with that guy. Bye. I need a shot of you in pursuit! You going to let him talk like that? Forget it. This way I can get more close-ups. But I'll have to have a talk with the director. Director. Will you tell us the truth? Who's the star of this movie, him or me? You, of course. Then why is the set only half finished? Rumor has it the final staircase scene has been cut. Tell me that's not true. It's been cut. Why? It's my big final scene! I fight off a samurai and kick him down the stairs. - It's my best scene. - The studio cut it. So the studio doesn't want to be held responsible. But people will be saying we couldn't pull it off. The police are nosey, too0. Of course they want to stop us. A man could die. But we need the scene to make a good picture. Without that scene, the movie will flop. Isn't that right? It sure won't sell. I wouldn't want to see a film like that. Well, what gets me is that without this scene, tachibana gets more screen time. It's already hard to tell who's the star. It's my movie! It's my movie! I'm the director! Now, now. Let's just call it our movie. So let's do the staircase scene. I want to do it, too. Why do you think I had this massive staircase built? But nobody will take the fall. The stuntman from 1okyo got cold feet and took off. Do you know anyone, gin-chan? Somebody willing to take a fall from up here who wouldn't Mina breaking his back for us? A movie freak who'll give his life to entertain the audience. Know of anyone like that, gin-chan? I thought a big star would have a few lackeys here and there. You guys? Of course no one's going to do it. These are bad times to make movies. Everything's about respecting life and rejecting violence. Hey, set designers, what do you suggest? I know you built these stairs. How about a third of the size? A smaller staircase, suited to a more peaceful Japan? Bastards! Idiots! Mr. kuraoka. May I have your autograph? I'm a big fan. Sure. Some paper. No, not on paper. Will you come with me? Write it here. Here you go. I love [t! Really? - What's your name? - Tomoko. A lovely name. Thank you so much. Not at all. Nice, huh? It's refreshing to meet such an innocent girl. - She's exactly my type. - Absolutely. Did you get her phone number? You idiots! Yasu, run! Iviake it look like it was your idea, okay? I'll give up my past ways. Wait! - Listen! - What're you doing, you stupid idiot! Way to go! Let's go have a drink to celebrate! People sure seem to envy me! Yeah, you re great. Your fashion sense is unbeatable. That's right. Where's the enthusiasm? Hey, makoto. Change places with me. - But you don't have a license. - Idiot! This is a Cadillac! You don't need a license for a Cadillac! - Careful! - The police! What are you doing? You want us to haul you in? We've done nothing wrong, officer. We'll just be on our way. I'm not popular anymore. My star is fading. I've been here nearly an hour, put nobody's asked me for my autograph. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? - Gin-chan! - Shut up! What's the name of this bar where I, ginshiro kuraoka, am drinking? Shishido. That's no answer! I'm the famous ginshiro kuraoka. L, ginshiro kuraoka, am drinking here. So what do you call this place? Answer or I il burn it down! I'm sorry! He's drunk! Where do you think you get the money to eat and drink? I know you guys take money from me and bet on the horses! - No, we don't. - Tome does. You bastard! Why are you so angry? Want me to go and kill someone? The director? Tachibana? I'll go kill them! Don't you realize how we feel? We're always ready to do anything for you. We're here. - Look, gin-chan. You're home. - Careful now. - You okay? - I don't understand him. I'll take care of him. Be careful with him. Put out the light. Are you konatsu? Put it out. Please. You're always with gin-chan, right? Has he told you about me? Yes. I mean, no. Hasn't he told you about a washed-up actress who follows him around, pestering him? No. You don't have to be polite. I know it's true. I'll see to him. You can go. Well, then, please take care of him. A strange love takes the form of a woman she'll come around tonight our love is still new Your death scenes are getting pretty good. Hey! What brings you here? This is no place to live. These are filthy! Junk 'em! I've got tons of money. I'll pay for new. Some paparazzi are watching me. See that dog? - What is that? - I had makoto dress up like that. How does it look, makoto? Nothing unusual. Keep a good lookout! Poor guy. It's so hot out. Oh, I brought a woman with me. Come in. Come on. It's you. Don't just stand there. Get a cushion! Come in. Here you go. What brings you here? You and your formal questions. You're so uptight! And what's this poster, anyway? Who's that foreigner? Don't you know James Dean? - Is he popular? - Sort of. He looks like a guy you'd see running a food stall in the street. Actually, he'd look like you if he grew a beard. - How do you like it? - I admire your style. Yeah? She says it's so "unique" that no one else would wear it. I don't think so. - Where's the suit I gave you? - I still have it. - Wear it. - It's so fancy. Put it on for me. I give them plenty of stuf. I'm a generous guy. How do I look? It suits you better than me. Show me your underwear. A dragon and Jewel balls for luck. - What do you guys think of me? - You shoot from the hip. Actually, they think I'm a real pain. She's laughing! Yasu, do me a favor. You have no future, right? You have no future, right? Answer! You're too slow to answer. Keep a positive spirit! A positive spirit is important. I have a bright future. I think so. The boss called me in. They want me on the January page of next year's calendar. - You beat tachibana? - They'll sell my records, too. They want me to tidy up a few things. They're staking their future on me. But it's four months now. I mean konatsu here. In short, she's pregnant. I told her to get an abortion, but she said this may be her last chance. Yasu, I beg you. Will you marry her for me? That would set everything right. I'll be good to you forever! How about it? Will you do it? Konatsu, he'll understand. Yasu, get your seal. A marriage certificate? You have to ask how she feels about it. Who do you think you're talking to? Konatsu. I wonaer if I can make it without you. I feel uneasy about a future all by myself. Some of the crew say they won't work with me. Actors refuse to back me up if I'm the hero. Only management seems to like me. Do you think I can carry a big company like toei alone? It's too0 much. Gin-chan. I understand. I won't complain anymore. Konatsu... I won't cause you any more trouble. Keep making good films. Don't let tachibana beat you! Don't be so dramatic. You're making me cry. Take care of her, yasu. She's pregnant, so she won't be able to go to a public bath. Iviove to a bigger place with a nice bath. I'll do my best, too. Sure. I'll do my best. Just make good movies. 'Ll take good care of her. - Are you happy about this? - No. Are you that hungry for women? I'll get a bigger place. I can do it. - Do it? - What's wrong? - I'll get more work. - More work? Just concentrate on making good movies and records. I eave the rest to me. Of course I'll make good movies! But what can you do for me? Keep out of this! All you can do is wait, like a beggar. Have you ever found work on your own? I've been getting you the work. I didn't mean - I feel bad that the parts I've gotten for you have no dialogue. But I've done my best. Do you think you're talented? Huh? Think you have talent as an actor? No. Find your own jobs and your own women! Watch this. - You love me, right”? - Stop! - You love me, don't you? - I don't want this. It's hard on you, I know. I know. But it's hard on me too, konatsu. I love you, konatsu. Konatsu. Gin-chan. Yasu, I told you to watch! I wish you every happiness. I love you. I love you, gin-chan. Gin-chan. What'll I do? He isn't a bad guy, but he goes too far sometimes. What'll we do about this? The marriage certificate. Destroy it. I'm sure you don't want any of this. But I'll get in trouble with gin-chan. You're worried you ll be in trouble, after what he just did? Have you no pride? I hate men like that! - I'll do my best. - How? I'll try my best so you won't hate me. You saw, didn't you? You saw what we were doing. Are you crazy? Wait a minute! Look at this. The film you first starred in ten years ago. This was the first film you were in with gin-chan, right? I've been your fan ever since. Please marry me. I beg you. Are you saying you ll be the father of my baby? You've got family, don't you? How will you explain this? Well, I'll manage. Then call your family now and tell them there's a pregnant girl you're going to marry. I'm so grateful. I was about to kill myself. I've reached the point where any man who accepts my child will do. We can take care of legal matters later. - You can't, can you? - Well - - you re backing out. - No, that's not true. I have to go. - Just wait three aays. - Let go of me! Give me three days and you'll learn to love me. - Please! - Let go! Please! I beg you! Konatsu? What's wrong, konatsu? She has toxemia. What's that? She has high blood pressure. And kidney trouble, too. She should be hospitalized. If I send her to a hospital, she might not come back here. What? Aren't you the child's father? Yes, I'm the father. I am the legal, true father, but... A strange love takes the form of a woman she'll come around tonight our love is still new put you know I'll be there for you just tell me one thing say the first thing that comes to mind only love can confound me so I'ne lovers in the rain on the street corner next we have a sentry in a samurai movie. 2,000 yen. How about it? A thug in the adventurers. This one pays well. You have to jump from a window 100 feet up. - 5,000 yen. Any takers? - Too cheap! I'll do it! That's seven roles. Sure you can handle it, yasu? My girl's pregnant. Really? Yasu's going all out for his kid's sake. I'll pay you an extra 3,000 yen! That's unfair! That was good. We need another man to go through this screen. You won't do. You neither. We've seen you too much already. "Il do it. But you just did one. That was my brother. Please! My girl's pregnant. I can do it better with yasu. Great. Let's do it. Ready... action! Watch it! You idiot! - Sorry. - Is the camera all right? Idiot! Sorry. I don't want it. I hate you! - Get out! - You have to eat. The doctor and nurses said - and gin-chan - they're all worried. I don't need any of that! You okay? I couldn't work if I couldn't take a hit. I'm used to it. It's time for me to go. But please eat something. I've left some cake and fruit. Well, see you later. You all right? What's wrong, sanada? I'm fine. It's yasu. No, I'm all right. Sorry to worry you. You okay? Sure! My girl's pregnant. Let's do it again. Mr. muraoka®? Konatsu, are you really better? She'll be fine. It's nothing. Thank you very much. I'm glad. I'm so glad. Come in. What's all this? I want you to live more comfortably. Rest here. Well, are you surprised by all this? I bought it all on the installment plan. This is my room. A washing machine's coming tomorrow. See you later. Wait a minute. What did you do toaay to buy a washing machine? Can you tell? You're psychic. I can tell from those bandages. Today was just 5,000 and 8,000 yen. Tomorrow I'll jump from a tower for 10,000 yen. Only 10,000 yen for such a risky job? But I've got a good reputation. They can see the grief on my back. Like when you re being burned alive, rolling from a fiery car. It's really hard to express grief. But I can really lay it on, and they gave me 30,000 yen for it. Grief? But you don't even show your face. You think the audience wants to see my face? Right”? I don't care about showing my face. I just want to make good movies. Gin-chan. This daddy's pretty generous, huh? Did you come to see me? Look at you. So full of hope for the future. - I have no future. - What happened? Tomoko. That cute little tomoko. Now the kid says she doesn't understand me. I knew it. She's the one you left me for. Listen. I call her, but she refuses to see me. - Good for her. - Now I'm depressed. I can't act well. Konatsu, will you talk to her for me? - Why should I do that? - Fool. Because youre the only one who really understands me. Talk to her and explain how wonderful I am. Please do it. I'm asking you, too. - You have nothing to do with this. - But I do! If he's depressed, what if he messes up the next big release? I'm serious. The boss says I'm going to be a big star. Tomoko's a banker's daughter. She even studied in the states. - Hell, she can even speak english! - So what? The boss says tomoko's the right girl for me. Konatsu, please talk to her. Please. I beg you! Did I say I didn't understand him? He thinks too much of himself. I never try to understand men. - How about you? - Me? I et me see... Hey, listen to this. Don't you think ginshiro is going bald? Bald? I made a joke, saying I wished he were bald, pecause that way he wouldn't be so popular with women. 90 he started pulling out his hair, saying that he'd go bald for me. It was so funny I started laughing. Gin-chan's very naive. It's like he grew up but stayed a child at the same time. If you want to marry him, you must understand that. Oh, ginshiro! - Enjoying your chat? - Yes, very much. - Did you tell her about me? - Sort of. She talked a lot about you. Seems I misunderstood you. I'm glad that's cleared up. - Let's go. - Where? Where else? You wanted to learn tennis, so I reserved a court. I bought you a racket, proper shoes and clothes. - Let's go. - But... She's got things to do. Come on. Let's go. Welcome back. - I'm back. - How's gin-chan? - Seems it worked. - Really? More on the installment plan? What's that? I thought I'd cook you something good. I'll do that. No. Tonight I'll do it. Really? Then I'd better clean up. Hello”? Yes, speaking. I understand. Thank you. It was your mother. What's this about taking me to visit? She said everyone's excited to meet me. Gin-chan said to marry you legally, so - he has nothing to do with us. He has everything to do with us! He's very important to us. Are you serious? You'll really be my child's father? - Will you really marry me? - Yes, of course. It's just that - I'm just a lowly bit player. And I don't earn much. So it's hard for me to ask. You should be able to ask. You've got to get over that. Propose to me properly. Then... Will you marry me? "Then" is unnecessary. I accept. Please take care of me. I can be rather spoiled. Mom must've been happy. Did you understand her kyushu accent? But does your family know that the baby isn't your child? No, but that doesn't matter. Really? I hope you won't regret this. Please... Don't come to regret this. I promise. Still nothing? - Here they come! - It's yasu! Welcome yasuji muraoka and konatsu mizuhara! Brother! Welcome! Thank you. You must be tirea. Come this way. I'm so glad you're home, yasu! Viom, meet konatsu. I'm konatsu. Pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming all this way. This way, please. This way. Viake an offering to your father. And konatsu, too. Rather would've been so happy to see you now. Yasu has grown up well and brought home a bride. I am konatsu, father. Please help me have a healthy baby. Yasu, good for you! You found yourself a good wife! I'm sure your mother is relieved. I'm glad for you! I feel wondadertul. To have a girl like you wash my back. I'm glad I've lived this long. Oh, it's nothing. Konatsu... What does your family say about your marriage? Konatsu, if your family objects, consider eloping with my son. I set aside a million yen for him. You can go far away, even to the states. But really, what do you see in yasu? He's diligent. He always has been. Our yasu has always been diligent. Please don't let him down. That's all I ask. Konatsu. I don't care whose baby it is. I know yasu couldn't have pulled this off by himself. Even if / was a young woman, I wouldn't fall in love with him. He's never been the type women fall for. The only good thing about him is he's always been very kind, ever since he was a child. I remember when he was in the seventh grade. I was hospitalized in town, and he traveled five hours round-trip every day to visit me. He bathed me so tenderly. Konatsu, please don't desert him. Don't abandon him. He's so happy to have found you. Please don't leave him. Try to see it through. I'm sorry. I'll do my best. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. I'll do my best. Please be kind to me. I'll do my best, too. Come. We're going... To be man and wife. Yes... We are. Konatsu! We won't hurt the baby? What did gin-chan look like again? I can't remember. Women are such devils, aren't we? Toe! Film studios - Kyoto Good morning. Hey, this is no place to be kicking me in the stomach. - Thank you. - See you later. 1oku! Konatsu! - Long time no see. - What brings you here? I brought yasu's lunch. Are you really going to marry him? Will you come to the wedding next week? - You'd better back out. - Why? It isn't his kid, is it? No. But he says he doesn't mind. He's just saying that. That kind of thing bothers men. Besides, bit players can be shady characters sometimes. Well, I'll manage. Right. I hope you don't regret it. See you around. Come on, eat. She's a good cook. This aluminum foil helps keep the flavors apart. - Here's some lemon. - What are you all goo-goo about? Stop being so polite! Dig in! (Go ahead. She won't bite. There's no need to hold back. Make them some tea. - She's quite beautiful. - Oh, stop that. We thought she'd never speak to us. You tool! Oh, right. We were talking about the wedding. - Yuji and futoshi will act as hosts. - It would be an honor. Makoto will help, too. That reminds me. Tome, give her your present. My wife said to give you this. - A maternity belt? - I hope it works. Thank you. Shooting is about to begin... You were so slow we missed the food. - We'll eat later. - Save these for supper. Let's go. Gotta go. We'll be late. See you later. Good morning. Gin-chan. What are you doing there? No shooting until tonight. Oh, wow. You sure have ballooned! It kicks sometimes, like you used to kick me in your sleep. Don't say that. Are you coming to the wedding next week? Sure. I'm not too busy, being alone and all. You look down. What's wrong? They've been cutting my scenes a lot lately. Hey, how's tomoko? The other day she said she'd cook supper for me. But she changed her mind and got drunk instead. She really let me down. - What about the housework” - She never bothers. Your place must be filthy again. In the middie of that mess, she blasts out Stevie wonder. It's hard to take when you're tired. I generally prefer ballads and love songs. Remember? Why cry like that” you make me want to come back to you. That's what's nice about you. Have you had your wedding rehearsal? They sure are slow. Why haven't they got their act together? Okay, I'll show you. Take my arm. You and I were supposed to do this, with me in a white gown. Don't tell me you're really going to wear one. Sure. Why not? I wouldn't do it. You're carrying proof of a dark past. The white gown will purity my heart. Women sure have their ways. Besides, the wedding march will be played on a pipe organ. Not so loud right in my ears. Make it loud enough, and it'll blast your past away. I know. And something interesting will happen. A spotlight on you. Another on the groom. But there's no one there. Nobody in the spotlight. - Then what happens? - Everyone's in a fuss. They search for the groom. "Where's the groom?' then, with great fanfare, a spotlight comes on! And I'm standing in it. Not yasu, but me, in a white tux. You're joking again. You think so? You think I'm just joking? You don't think I'd do that? Gin-chan, don't tell me... L_et's give them a real surprise. Give me your hand. It's just right. - What's this? - Aring. A man normally gives it to a woman. An engagement ring. Four carats. I sold my place and bought it for 30 million yen. What is this about? I want to be with you. Are you serious? Of course. Let's get married. Gin-chan. Pon't cry. We're linked by fate. We can't leave one another. Don't you remember what you did to me? Forget about that. Besides... I'm beginning to love yasu. You mustn't lie to yourself. Be true to your heart. I'm the one you love. Yes, I really do love you. Then answer me. Will you marry me or not? Women normally beg me to marry them. You should be doing the same. But I understand. You're all flustered 'cause a stud like me is proposing. Konatsu. What does this mean? I went to kyushu to meet his family. They welcomed me, saying I would make a good wife. His mother asked me to take care of him. So I can't betray them. That's how I feel. Are you saying you'll leave me all alone? I'm beginning to understand as I go into my eight month. Understand what? I'm going. What's best for a woman is... Aren't you going to stop me? A man who stays by her side. You never stay. Why don't you stop me? Can't you see how lonely I look? Yes, but I won't stop you. You'll be sorry. I know. But good-bye. Screw you! Gin-chan. What are you doing, konatsu? - What's happening? - What do you mean? - We're going to be late! - Hurry! Stop it! What's all this about? It's your wedding! Here comes the groom: Put her down! Good night, you two! - Sweet dreams! - Good night! Hey, come on! Stay a little longer! No, thanks. Now we're really married. I'm so happy. Happy with me? A lowly bit player who'll never get anywhere in life? Can you really be happy with me? Thank you, konatsu. - Hey! Have you seen gin-chan? - No. - Where is he? - That guy! Good morning. Sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. tachibana, forgive me, but would you please wait a minute? You telling me I have to wait? Is that what you're saying? Explain yourself! Now! Ginshiro's missing. He disappeared somewhere, still wearing his costume. - He's gone? - Yes. What the hell? Hey, director. Come to think of it, I guess I know how he felt. What? He ran away. He couldn't stand his own lousy overacting. If the star is so lousy, what about his lackeys? Even worse. Stinking no-brain bit players! Call yasu! - You go that way! - You, that way! I got it. Hello? Oh, yuji? All right! I'm coming now! - What's happened? - Gin-chan's missing. Wait a minute! - Is gin-chan here? - No. Have you seen gin-chan? No, I haven't. I see. Hanks. Gin-chan! Do not enter! Here rests ginshiro Gin-chan! What do you want? Gin-chan! What are you doing here? Yasu, I'm all washed up. Why are you saying that? That's not like you! They're using tachibana for the January page of the calendar. - My summer film was canceled again. - Canceled? And tomoko and I broke up. I'm all alone now. Ltachibana's become the star of our samurai picture. They're cutting all my cool scenes. I wish I could at least do that staircase scene. That way I could go out with class. I know exactly how I'd do it. Watch. The imperial guard bangs on the inn door. The proprietor yells, "guests upstairs, please run! The imperial guard is here!" We smash the door down and storm in, killing a few samurai coming down from upstairs. We pin the rest of them down on the staircase as I advance menacingly, bit by bit. Hurry up and do it! One attacks me and I slash him across the chest. He falls backward into a somersauit. We'll use two boom cameras, high-speed and a hand-held. And we film that cut with five or six other cameras! Sounds great! Think of that staircase! That height! I'm going to look great! - It'll be a great scene. - Absolutely! I wish I could ao it. But it was cut. The studio's afraid. The director gave in. They officially cut it. Is that so? Can't blame them. Someone could die doing that. But I've suddenly lost my drive. That's why they re killing oft my character, toshizo hijikata. Hey, yasu. It all must have been some kind of idiotic dream. Okay. I'll do it. - I'll do the fall. - What? Your future's at stake. Who else could do it? - What're you talking about? - Don't worry. Now go back to the studio. Everyone's waiting for you. Yasu, wait! Director. You don't mind if we end the staircase right here? It won't look any good from here. I know that! It's times like these that I start to lose my confidence. I'll take the fall down the staircase! What? You're one of ginshiro's men. Yes. He'll be here soon. I'l do it for him to help make the movie great. Don't be ridiculous! - You aren't even a real stuntman! - But - listen. You could die. I don't care. I'll sign a release. Then the company won't be held responsible, right? Are you serious? Yes. My wife's pregnant, and I need the money. Very well. L_isten, everyone! Finish the staircase as planned! This bit player says he'll take the fall. - Great! - Do jt! Come with me to the chief. I'll get you a million yen in hazard pay. However... Don't look back when you fall, okay? Dead men don't look back when they fall. Got it? Can you do that? - Yes, I can. - All right. Even if you look back, you might still die. All right! I'm actually gonna kill a man! This picture will be a big hit! Life insurance? But I'm not sure. Your husband wants to insure himself for 30 million yen. The policy's ready. Just put your seal here. He said nothing about it. - Mrs. muraoka! It's yasu! - What happened? He's doing the staircase scene! Staircase? You mean that staircase? That's right. They re all excited about it at the studio. Konatsu, I'm back! Hey, what's the matter with you guys? Why the long faces? - Hello, Mr. muraoka. - Oh, right. You're the insurance man. I'll get my seal. - Where? - Right here. No, don't! I'll leave the rest to you. - Listen. - Never mind. You're all beneficiaries too. What are you saying? We never asked for that. Why don't you think of konatsu first? You know lakaoka, who took the same fall ten years ago? He's crippled and still laid up in bed. Why did you take that stupid job? It's not stupid! I'm doing it for gin-chan! Who do you think made us what we are? What if something happens? - Fine! I'll ask gin-chan to stop it! - You idiot! - Stop it, yasu! - You trust him more than me? - What're you talking about? - Then go back to him! - Honey! - Let me go! It's too0 late. They're all excited. They took my hand and thanked me in tears, saying the spirit of movie making was still alive. I have to do 1it now. I don't want to eat. I'm going to bed. Higher. Turn. Taro, run up. Stop. Now forward. Good morning. Nice set, huh? It'll get even better. You'll be surprised when it's finished. Stand at the top. Viove left. Right there. It sure is a long one when you think about falling down it. It's three times as high as normal. You'll be the hero, not gin-chan or tachibana. Gin-chan came by a while ago. He was almost crying, muttering, "yasu's going to fall all this way." I see. That's impressive. My character, ryoma sakamoto, is a national hero, right? Of course he is. Yet some dit player is going to steal the show by falling down some stairs? That's not right! The audience won't like it either. Tell the stunt coordinator to come up with something. I don't care if someone falls off the roof. I want to see something fancy. And for every one they kill, we have to kill three! Good idea. I'll go tell him. Why don't we kill several at once? Idots! If you all die, who'll protect me? Us? Wait a minute! Gin-chan! I hear you came to see the staircase too. You're going to make me a killer. _et's go! What's wrong with him? He can't face you. Sometimes he's a little weak. This way. Is everyone here? I'm back. Tomorrow I take the staircase fall. Think about how to spend your share of the money. Let's drink to it. Bring sake. - Who are you? - What do you mean, who are we? They're beneficiaries to the insurance policy. The total will be 100 million yen. You and gin-chan will each get 30 million. Please leave, all of you. What's that? Don't mind her. Stay. Eat! Please leave! What's that, woman? Your man told us to come, so that's why we're here! Don't talk like that. (Go home! Please go! L_ooks like we can't stay here. Let's go. See you tomorrow. Will you eat? I'll cook something. I don't want anything. What's that? Are you saying I stink? What was that gesture supposed to mean? Remember when gin-chan farted? "Ooh, stinky-poo!" You ran around the studio lot, laughing and carrying on! What's that mean?” You don't Mina his farts. But you think mine stink. I'm your husband, huh? Our marriage means nothing to you! It's pathetic! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Did you and gin-chan decide how you'll spend your money? What did he say? Tell me what he said. I want to know. Why do you mention him all the time? I broke up with him forever. But you're having his bastard child. Think of something more important! What about our life together? He's been kind of cold towards me lately. I wonder why that is. I even accepted his kid, but - don't change the subject. He ran away from me today. Wouldn't look me in the eyes. Tomorrow's the big fall. I can't do it right if I feel like this! - I might aie! - That's why I told you not to do it! This is bullshit! Why was I forced to marry you then? A woman who's been knocked up! Were we forced to be together? That's not all. Why have I taken blows from him for these ten years? Why? Huh? Why? Please don't kick my belly! It's my baby! What did I do wrong? Why are you so angry? A mere dit player like me couldn't understand! Why has this turned into a problem now, just when I'm almost due? Why did you accept me? I'm just a bit player! I just tollow the orders my superiors give me! When they say jump, I jump! When they say roll, I roll! I even go through fire! I tall from staircases! For only 5,000 yen! That's what bit players like me do! You got a problem with that”? Well? Got a problem with that? Any complaints? I didn't mind until just a while ago. I very obediently did just as they told me and laughed it off. So what's wrong with me now? The more I love you, the sadder I feel. Honey. The more firmly I make up my mind to live with you, the more sorrowful I feel. Honey. The more closely I become attached to you, the more painful I feel all over. Honey! I really wonder what's wrong with me. I've caused you a lot of suffering. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Will you come home tonight? I want you to come home tonignt! I think the baby will arrive tonight or tomorrow. Sure I feel sorry for you because it's not your child, but I want this baby. I'm a woman, after all. Besides, you may laugh when I say this, but I like the life we have. I really treasure it. I don't want to lose our life together, even if you kick me or hit me. Can't we make it work? Good morning. Who are they? Big shots from headquarters and theater owners. What a long staircase! How high is it? About 30 feet. It has 39 steps. It's exactly three times the height of a standard staircase. The highest in Japanese movie history. Will a man really fall down that? He might kill himself. We're certainly worried ourselves, but he insists on doing it. When you're ready, we'd like to start as soon as possible. Yasu, about the swordplay - no need to discuss that. How long do you think I've been doing this? Besides, who needs instruction in falling down a staircase? The camera just has to follow me as I fall. Cameramen, I'm counting on you! There will be no retakes! Ouch! What's wrong? Who put this nail here? You want me to die? You all right? Did you do it? Was it you? No! I wiped each step down with this cloth! Then why was it there? Somebody explain it to me! Il won't move until someone tells me. Please, yasu. The vips came to encourage you, despite their busy day. Could you please cooperate just a bit? Cooperate? How? By taking a quick fall to my death? I'm just a bit player. I can't die the slow, dramatic way that stars do. And I wouldn't want my miserable death to interrupt their busy schedules, so get rid of them! You can't talk to us like that! Give me my last coffee. - Coffee! - All right! What's the matter? Don't I deserve a light for my cigarette? I'm about to die, you know! This is my last smoke. Don't use that cheap lighter! Makoto, give me my lighter. Ivir. Kuraoka. That's enough! Gin-chan! - That's more like you! - What? Your hitting me like that will make my fall better! Listen, forgive me, but can you postpone the shoot until after dinner? Just this once, give me time to get into character. I'm still unsure about how I should die. Is this the studio? I'm yasujl muraoka's wife. About the staircase scene... Postponed until after dinner? Thank you for telling me. You want to come out? Can you wait? Just a little longer. Haven't you eaten? It's almost time to go on the set. Eat and get your energy up. You eat it. It would look really pathetic if I vomited after I fell. Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm ready. Very well. Shall we do 1t? I et's start! Take your positions! F1lming! Cameramen, okay? Gaffers, okay? Sound, okay? Sets and fire, okay? Scene 71! Staircase at lkedaya inn! Ready! Action! I'm cc o ming: Who is it? The imperial guard! Guests upstairs, please run! It's the imperial guard! Honey! Honey! Good, yasu! Climb! Crawl up! You're a patriotic samurai who has fallen in glory! Don't die so easily! Camera! Zoom in on him! If you cut now, I'll kill you! Come on up, yasu! Come up! That's it! Keep coming, yasu! What's wrong, yasu? Crawl up! Come on up here! Gin-chan, you look so cool. Yasu! Darling! The baby's crying. It was born at last, the baby who had such a hard time inside me. Konatsu. Someone's calling me. Konatsu. It's yasu. Darling, are you all right”? Are you still alive after taking such a long fall? But... I'm afraid to open my eyes. If I find you're not there, I can't go on living. But... The baby's calling me. It's calling me. I'll open my eyes. I'm going to open them. Konatsu, have you come around? Honey! We have a little girl. She's so cute. I'm glad she doesn't 100k like gin-chan or me. She looks strong-willed, like you. Honey... The three of us will live together. You, the baby and me. Cut! Okay!
