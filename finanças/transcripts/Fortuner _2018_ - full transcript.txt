Hey Nandu! Why are you smoking in front of the hospital? My wife is sick. She has gone in for a check-up. What happened to her? The usual gynecological problems. - Gynecological problem? The treatment is so expensive.. - How much did this cigarette cost? 10 rupees. - 10 rupees! How many cigarettes are you carrying with you? - One more. You're ready to spend after something that can kill you.. ..but you can't afford to save your wife's life. What nonsense! Look! Smoking kills. But, this sanitary pad can save a life. Don't laugh. At the price of two cigarettes you can buy this sanitary pad.. ..that'll save your wife from the gynecological problems caused.. ..due to the use of dirty cloth during menstruation. Quit smoking to avoid chances of a fatal disease. You can save two lives with the money you're spending in buying fatal cigarettes. One yours and the other your wife's. Give it a thought and then laugh. Smoking doesn't make you a hero. Buying this makes you one. Hi, Preeti! Hello! Good morning, Mr. Swamy. Mr. Guruswamy, good morning I say. Mr. Guruswamy! Good morning, sir. Hey, don't disturb the system. If it reboots, I will give you boot shots. Our boss keeps saying that there is no computer expert as good as you. They say that you search the mouse in the laptop.. ..so well that you surpass even a cat. He is irritated. It was not me, boss said that. - Get lost, you bugger! Even you are not understanding my situation and feelings. Darn these situation and feelings! You bought a new house, a car and your wedding is fixed too. Our stubborn boss has approved a month's leave for you.. ..then what the heck are the feelings and situations you are talking about? Pal, I am not interested in getting married to that rural girl.. ..who has such low mentality. By the way, what's not good about her, her beauty or her behaviour? I don't know all that, I saw her many years before. But she doesn't have parents. - Hey! Are you serious? How did she take birth then? Is she a test-tube baby? Hey, test-tube babies are awesome. Please listen to me. A girl like her is not a good match for me, pal. I need a posh girl. - Oh, I see. I am a white collar worker, whereas she is a torn sari woman. The pair would be so bad, right? My mom is not at all understanding my situation and feelings. I can use this excuse to get him pay for my drinks. Mr. Guruswamy, this is not an ordinary issue, this is quite serious. So, there is a suitable place to discuss this at BAR. Let's go there in the evening and discuss this properly, what do you say? Hey! - Still, I have a doubt. This virtual girl... who is she according to you? UI Team Anusha.. - Oh, I see.. (Gasps) Anusha? Oh, shucks! I was going to say that it would be good if the girl is like her. Like her? You mean, a girl like her? Like Anusha? Hey, you will get Blood Pressure free with Diabetes. You will get arrogance free with beauty if you want a girl like her. God has created Anusha by mixing arrogance, attitude and superiority complex. Pal, she is like a fire-bomb. I am so sorry, ma'am. - You rascal! - (Slaps) Here you go, live example. Pal, maybe she took birth as a Celestial nymph. I don't know much about it, but I am sure about one thing. Listen to me.. ..she is not a good match for you. - Hi, Swamy. Good morning. (Humming) "Come on, girl.." - (Laughs) Hello! - (Laughs) Hello! Hi, guys! Good morning. We are gaining huge profits and are really getting lucky day the day. All that is because of your hard work. If there are dedicated workers like you, the company will progress very fast. The company has grown, and of course, your salaries also. So, congratulations! (Applause) Beyond that, I have one good news for you. Congratulations, Anu! You have bought Lawrence to our office. You should lead the back-end team, okay? - Thank you. Yeah! (Applause) Hey, Swamy! She will be a Team Leader. Please share your thoughts with her. Did you get it? - Enjoy your work! Work hard and party harder. (Laughs) Anu, meet me in the cabin. Congratulations! Very good! - Thank you. Congrats. - Thank you. Congratulations! - Thank you. Anu, you don't have to worry about the new team and the new work. Swamy will be very helpful to you in the new team. In fact, Swamy deserved this promotion more.. ..I recommended you, you know? The mind asked me not to, but my heart said, go ahead. Anu, I will keep giving you promotions. I will keep changing your teams.. ..and to my cabin. My cabin to my house, my house to my bedroom. Sleeping alone on a double-bed and thinking about you.. ..is really hard, you know? What do you mean? You know what I mean. Like a crocodile who is so powerful in the water.. ..that it can even pull an elephant into the water. Don't consider me weak, I am terribly strong in the bed. You know, I don't believe in this marriage and all. Everything about it is so irritating and disgusting. It doesn't make sense. In a room, if our minds match.. ..we can keep rewinding it and be happy. Just once, Anu. I will take care of your status and promotions after that. You bloody scoundrel! You think I am a bitch? Did you think you can take undue advantage of me just because I am an orphan? I have seen many like you. Hell with your job and hell with your promotion! Do you know what will happen if I complain to the Sexual Harassment Wing? Hey, relax! Why are you overreacting? I just asked what I wanted. If you are not interested, no issues. I didn't force you, right? Don't mix it up with your promotion. Many girls wait for such promotions and you deserve this. Please take it. Excuse me, I am not that kind of a girl. Anu! Once again, congratulations! Let us end it here. (Scoffs) (Music) "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." "Without her, I have no life.." "Please understand my pain.." "I followed her till eternity, she never looked back.." "I called her like it was my duty, she never answered.." "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." (Music) "You entered my life like the sunrise.." "You are the heroine for my life story.." "Your steps are like dance moves, your bangles rhythm is like music.." "Your words are like a music, sing it in my ears.." "Be the dance or trance, take my heart away.." "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." "Without her, I have no life.." "Please understand my pain.." Just tell me once, I can even carry a Shiv Linga for you like Bahubali did. Really! Stupid! I don't want a guy who carries a Shiv Linga in Bahubali movie. I want a husband who carries the groceries home in the beginning of the month. Nonsense! "I feel like I have failed for the first time.." "Like the red signal in the traffic.." "Like the answer that never flashes during the exam.." "Like an ad in the FM, why do you need so many breaks?" "How do I tell her how much I love her?" "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." "Without her, I have no life.." "Please understand my pain.." "I followed her till eternity, she never looked back.." "I called her like it was my duty, she never answered.." "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." Hey, girl with an attitude! Do you consider yourself a Celestial nymph? You are just an average girl, you can never get a better guy than me. I have been requesting you every single day since two years.. ..but you are consistently rejecting me. Understand one thing, no one will try to woo you. My father is an MLA. Just wait and watch, I will get married to a girl a hundred times better than you.. ..and bring my child on a walk in this very road.. ..but you will still be walking wearing the same old bag.. ..then you will realise my value. I will kill you! Idiot, when did I say that I don't like you? First of all, stop this same old drama.. ..and say something to make me happy. Okay, listen to me now then. I am a graduate in Hotel Management. - What? Did you think I was a spoilt brat just because my father is an MLA? I am running a hotel in partnership with my friend, Prashanth. I am busy with that business. Are you serious? Are you into hotel business? - Yes. Okay, tell your parents about me. First, get married to me. Then we will see the rest. Thank God! We boys only pretend to be fast, but are very slow.. ..whereas why do you girls pretend to be slow when you are so fast? My mom has already agreed.. but convincing dad is a bit difficult. When someone wants to give you boot shots, it is wrong to buy them a new pair. I don't want all those excuses, that's your problem. By the way, I will visit your hotel tomorrow. You are cheating, sir. You showed me that house, but are handing me over this house now. It's not like that, the other customer processed it faster. So, I could not allot you that house. I am so sorry, sir. But I wanted that house, sir. - This house is good too, sir. Sir, there is a lot of difference between the two houses. Actually, it is the son of an MLA who has bought that house. He came with a recommendation, so we couldn't do anything about it. Sorry, sir. Have you explained it to him? - Yes, sir. I have. No one should drive faster than 10kmph in this road. No one should use this road unnecessarily. No one should enjoy the loud music in a car or a house. Understood? Good morning, Partha sir! Hello, ma'am. Sir.. Nice! Good! He is Prashanth! Hello! We pursued Hotel Management together.. ..he used my help to pass in the exams. - Oh, really? - (Laughs) I will order coffee or tea later. He is my best friend. Hi! So, I made him a partner in this hotel business. - A partner? He feels bad if I call him a partner, I should address him as a brother. Brother? Okay, done. I am the Boss, but he frames the conditions. He minds it if I call him a brother, I should call him a brother in Kannada. Am I right? - Brother, may I know who she is? Hey, Rascal Rawalpindi! Is this how you work? Don't you know who she is? She is Anusha, the great queen of Jayanagar 4th Block. Oh, so she is the one! - Yes. Okay! Welcome to our hotel, ma'am. - Thanks. Can I look around Partha's hotel? Partha's hotel? - Don't give too many reactions, idiot. It's not scripted, try to understand. Actually, he is not too fond of this hotel word. We should say it as restaurant. - Oh, I see. There is nothing to look around. All you have is four walls, a kitchen.. ..and sweating cooks in the kitchen. (Laughs) - What? What do you mean? - Should I deal with her reactions too? I mean, chefs. Ma'am, ignore his nonsense. You take a look around. - Yes, I will. Except the kitchen. - Okay. (Laughs) You are really great! You are also. "You are like a lotus, I can't live without seeing you." "I can't get away with the magic of jasmine.." "I can't get away with the magic of jasmine.." "I can't live without you.." - (Door creaks) Hey, naughty! Mother, what did you decide? What's there to decide? I have got you married, now take your wife along. I will stay in this house. What's so special about this house? Come and look how the house in Bengaluru is, you will love it. You can live there peacefully. (Chuckles) A home is not meant only to live peacefully. You were quite young when your father abandoned us. Every wall of this house has seen my pain and has consoled me. These walls made me muster up the courage to make what you are now. No, son. I won't leave this house. I agreed to get married only because.. ..I thought you would come with me to Bengaluru. Otherwise, I was never interested in this marriage. - Mind your tongue! Why should she come with me if you are not coming there? I will visit her often. It would be better for you if you take her to Bengaluru. You are superb! She always ignored you, but you have convinced her for wedding now. Very good! Wouldn't it be better if you informed your dad about it? Did my dad inform me when he got married? He didn't. Your logic is really strange. Anusha will know that you have lied to her someday, what will you do then? What can I do then? I will confess my lie to her and act innocent. She will get angry.. ..I will buy her a new pair of slippers to hit me until she calms down. It's okay if she calms down, what if she leaves you completely? Anusha, tell me. I don't know how uncle would react, so.. This is just a trial wedding. Your uncle will get you married in real with all the pomp and show in our place. That will be like a feast to the TV channels. They will keep repeating the same wedding cassette till it gets worn out. Anu, your uncle loves his son a lot. You don't be afraid, just come home and stand beside me bravely. I will deal with your uncle. (Horn blares) You don't worry whatsoever, seems like your uncle has come home. Goodnight. - Okay, Aunt. Goodnight. (Music) "Should I pinch myself?" "I am not able to believe if this true.." "Should I pinch myself?" "I am not able to believe if this true.." "Do not leave my hand.." "Do not break my dreams.." "Do not go away from me even for a moment.." "Let us not even think about going away from each other.." "Should I pinch myself?" "I am not able to believe if this true.." (Music) "I want you to palm my face.." "So that, I can keep looking at you.." "I want to be with you in every birth.." "And feel your breath on mine.." "I am not able to speak.." "Shedding tears of joy.." "I have worn your gift in my neck.." "I don't want anything else from life.." "Should I pinch myself?" "I am not able to believe if this true.." (Music) (Door bell rings) Mom? Oh, you are already here! Come in, come in. How are you, dear? Come in. - Mom, won't you welcome us traditionally? I will do that if your dad doesn't kick me traditionally, come in now. Mom! - Oh, God! Go and get the veneration platter. Now, don't ask me to fulfil more traditions. If your dad doesn't kick me, I will do all that. Come in soon. Enter with your right foot first. Come on in. God, please save me! Only You know what would happen! Mom, why are you so tense? Where is dad? He will be home any time. I have called him. God, please save me. - When I am so calm, why are you tense? You have the snacks, we have got them prepared especially for you. You are a boy, you will be calm obviously. You will remain silent when your dad comes.. ..but I can't. What do I do now? Oh, he has come! God, what do I do? Only You know what he would do. What do I do? Hey, come soon and take them. God, what would happen now? God, please save me. God, please help! There shouldn't be any problem in the mass-marriage we have organsied. - God! Those hundred couples.. Get me some water. (Slaps) Who is this 101th couple? - Dad, actually.. she is my friend. What kind of a friend? Girlfriend. What is this? Hello, Uncle. My name is Anusha. I don't like creating a scene unnecessarily. Partha and I got married this morning in the Sub-Registrar Office. We came here to inform you about it and take your blessings. A wedding is where the elders get their children married. If you get married in some office, it means that you are being misled. Now what I should give you is forgiveness, not blessings. But he never does anything that deserves forgiveness. Uncle, you have misunderstood Partha. I don't have to ask you about my son. We have given him birth and we are tolerating him now. My ill-fate! I think, you have been fooled as you got married to him.. ..because he is the son of an MLA. I didn't get married depending on you, we know how to live like a family. If you have any such ideas, you better get rid of them right now. You are not going to get anything from me. - Uncle, your money is not.. - Let's go. Partha.. Partha.. - What are you doing? - Be quiet, Mom. You come with me. I want to talk to him. - Anu.. Sorry, please don't mind me. He has completed Hotel Management, he owns a hotel too. What more do you want? (Laughs) So, he has told you the same story. I thought he has lied only to other people to hide his cowardice. You have fooled this innocent girl big time. Shame on you! Even my slippers lead a way better life than you. Do you really own a hotel? Girl, he has been paying to get passing marks since 10th grade. I knew that he won't be a good human being if he remains home.. ..so I threw him away from the house. Just imagine! His mom sends him money every time he demands. His friend owns a hotel, he feeds him every time he visits that hotel. He has free meal and roams around in the car. This is the life he is leading. It's believed that one shouldn't oust the newlywed couple. The door is open. Hey, come here. (Slaps) Get lost! What are you looking at? (Music) "I scribbled my dreams on the sea beach.." "It got washed away with the water wave.." (Music) "I scribbled my dreams on the sea beach.." "It got washed away with the water wave.." "I can't even trust my own shadow now.." "After the boat I trusted drowned.." "I can't even trust my own shadow now.." "After the boat I trusted drowned.." "I scribbled my dreams on the sea beach.." "It got washed away with the water wave.." (Music) (Crying) (Door knocks) (Music) "I am like a bird now which has lost its feather.." "The dream of reaching my destination makes no sense now.." "I couldn't recognise your fake smile.." "My dream has got shattered.." "No proof is needed for the broken heart.." "Aren't tears the proof enough?" "I scribbled my dreams on the sea beach.." "It got washed away with the water wave.." (Music) "In his world with no secrets.." "I am entering with these small steps.." "When someone calls him.." "It feels like they are calling me.." "How can I look at him with my shyful eyes.." "While my fingers are drawing imaginary pictures.." "I am going on the chariot of love.." "This excitement is too new for me.." "I will hold your hands and come with you.." "Your dreams are mine now.." "I will hold your hands and come with you.." "Your dreams are mine now.." "I have started weaving dreams.." "Help me complete them.." "I will hold your hands and come with you.." "Your dreams are mine now.." (Phone rings) Yes, Mom? Partha, what happened last night? Did Anu say anything? Did you people fight? I wouldn't have minded if she had scolded me and insulted me.. ..but she is a strong girl. She has a strong mind and weak body. What would you do now? - What would I do? I will correct my mistake. I know that it will take time. Everything is in her hands, Mom. If she...leaves you alone? Why is everyone making me feel scared? Do you all think I am not capable of convincing her? I have lied to her to get married.. ..but I really love her. I will fight to make her live with me all my life. It's okay if she doesn't treat me like a good husband.. ..or treats me like I am an idiot.. ..but I just want her to stay with me. I can't even hear that she won't be with me.. ..then how can I live if she leaves me alone? I will go to the Paying Guest, pack my bags and go to my office. I will come home from office, you get the bags. Should I drop you? (Scoffs) Spare me. - I'll call you back. Swamy? - Yes, sir. You reported to work a day before. Is everything okay? (Laughs) Why have you come to work when you are supposed to work somewhere else? - Exactly. I was done with my work, so.. - What's wrong with you? Only after you get married, you work day and night. Am I right, Rekha? (Giggles) Sorry. Sir, wish Anusha too. My grandpa got a heart attack, I got to know that only after he died. Similarly, now I got to know that she has got married. I am your boss. Forget inviting me, you could have at least informed me. Sorry, sir. It was unplanned. Unplanned, you say? - Yes, sir. Poor girl. Only children come unplanned, not weddings. Am I right, Rekha? (Laughs) Okay, just kidding. So, when is the party? We will discuss it and throw a party at home, sir. - Excuse me! You can't get together. I agree that you have got married. You can only discuss it, a house party is also good. The ambience should be good, that's it. Okay? - Yeah, yeah. Now, please carry on with your work. - Okay. - Okay. So, you are not going to give me anymore money. You have always given me money, now how can you refuse? How would I pay for my food? I know, Partha. This is what your father wants. He told me to not give you any pocket money. He has instructed the servants to keep an eye on telecalls with you. Such a pain! A maid will keep an eye on the owner now! Anything is possible in politics. Okay, hang up. - Okay. Now, what do you want? - I have prepared tasty Sambar for you. I want to have food with you. I asked you about your life and future. I will never lie to you. I will somehow correct my mistakes. I don't understand what profession I should choose. I am confused. I will take a good decision as soon as possible. My colleagues are coming home in the evening, I am throwing a party. Don't behave like a stupid with them, maintain some decency. I mean, don't open your mouth in front of them. Stupid! I better go outside, that would be good for you. What would I do if I don't talk to anyone? Just nod your head for everything I say. 'She respects me a lot.' 'God gives the tongue to talk, but wife locks it.' Shruti? Shruti, are you still alive? You and your face! I am throwing a party to my colleagues this evening. First of all, change your looks. What's wrong with this look? Do you want to know what's wrong? - Yes. You look like a scarecrow. Don't you have 'Chudidars'? My father had bought me some during my school days. They don't fit me now. - During your school days? Till what grade have you studied? This much. - 7th grade? Yes, very good. Did you pass or failed? I failed. - Very good! Don't wear this old fashion this evening, instead wear the one I have brought for you. Wear the bangles that I have bought, got it? One more thing, don't apply oil to your hair. Let them loose. That way, you will look modern. Got it? Shruti? (Door knocks) Shruti? (Door knocks) Shruti, how long do you take? Yes, I am adorning myself just like you have asked me to, please wait. No matter how much you adorn yourself, you will look the same. Come outside soon. Okay, I will come in a while. You carry on. I am telling you, understand my situation and feelings. Come out soon. Congratulations, pal! - Hi! Congrats, Swamy! - Thank you. Enjoy the party, man. Have fun. - Sure. Hey, what are you doing? - Hey, Swamy! - Hi! Why did you come alone? Where is your wife? Is she a bit slow? - She is coming. Is he? - Yes, she is. Sweetheart, don't act over smart. Hope you remember what I have told you. - You have got a good taste. You have caught a village belle. Very nice! Hey, why did you wear this sari? Where is the dress I gave you? - I have worn them inside. They looked indecent, so I covered them with the sari. Cheers to everybody! - Cheers! Wish them a happy married life! I wish you a happy married life! - Let us all have fun! Come, let's have some drink. - You carry on with your drink. Hi! Vidya! Saraswati! Did you find the party boring? (Laughs) You are so well-educated, still you are afraid of talking. (Laughs) If you are so timid, can we live with these corporate people? (Laughs) Hey, please stop crying. My wife will kill me if she sees you crying. Please stop crying, I will go away. I didn't do anything, I don't know anything. In the next birth, I will be your son and pursue masters degree, okay? See you. It's not about you, my husband. I don't have buffaloes, but cows. And I have...studied till this much grade. That too, I have failed. Why did he lie? She has completed her graduation though she comes from a rural background. She is pursuing masters here. - I don't have buffaloes, but cows. This is such a great fate! Both of us are treading the same path, but in two different vehicles. It happened with me too. My husband, Parth, owns a hotel. Happily married, happy life. I am very happy with him. Whatever my wife said is also a lie. Maybe, she wanted a husband who earns well.. ..but I met her. So, she has told all the lies to patch the broken threads. Does that mean, even my husband wanted a well-educated girl? I think so. It's true that I don't deserve to be the wife of him. My aunt asked me to get married, so I got married. But I didn't know this was the truth. - Seriously? You didn't know, but I did this knowingly. What can we do now? See you again. Bye, bye. (Car engine starts) (Laughs) (Yawning) (Laughs) (Gasps) Yeah. Yeah, yeah, got it. Yeah, yeah. Okay. (Chuckles) (Laughs) Did you have your food? Come home, I will serve you food. One lady, two hands. Did you prepare all these dishes? Not only this, I can cook many dishes. Then it is good that your husband fought with you and left with an empty stomach. Say sorry. No wife would be happy if her husband leaves with an empty stomach. So, I was going to give away the food to a dog. But then, you came. Please don't. Before you give away the food to dog, turn towards my house, I will be there. You shouldn't waste food, Mr. Shyam Murthy will get angry. Who is he? - He is the brand ambassador for headache medicines. My wife, the woman with an attitude, I am talking about her father-in-law. (Laughs) I swear on the dog, whenever any food is left come to the terrace and bark. I will drop in here. So, shouldn't I give away the leftover food to dog? No way, pack it for me. I will have it for dinner. Okay. Which hotel did you bring the food from? How did you get the money? The hotel.. (Humming) My friend, Prashanth.. On the friendship basis, I took a loan of Rs. 1000 without any interest. He told me to return it whenever I can. Do you know why I am still living with you? Not because I am hoping that you would change. I just don't want everyone to know that you have fooled me. Don't take loan from everyone and add up to my woes. Do not humiliate me. Eureka! Eureka! Eureka! Hey, MES! - I have told you, I don't have buffaloes, but cows. I have studied only till this much, moreover I have failed in the exams. I will get you get good grades. You cook really tasty food. I have completed Hotel Management. I mean, I haven't completed it, but it's okay. You prepare food, I will sell it. Why don't we start a 'give and take' business? I know how to 'geon', not sure about 'take' though. (Laughs) It's simple. Just prepare any dish you know and I will sell it. Let's share the profit equally, what do you say? How will you sell it? - Just like people sell vegetables. No, I won't do it. My husband will cut and boil if he comes to know about it. The brinjal? - No, me. Your husband returns home only at night. How will he know what happens when he is not home? What if people doubt that there is more to our relationship? Forget about the people. This is a good decision to teach a lesson to your husband and my wife. We should stand on our own two legs. - Then how do you think I am standing? On your husband's legs. - Really? That's why, he often says that he will kick me. - (Laughs) Oh, you have realised it now. I will get whatever I have at home, prepare whatever you get at your house. Let's start the business tomorrow. What about tomorrow? My husband is not home. - That is why, I came. MES, didn't I tell you about the food business? Open the door now. - I have told you, I don't have buffaloes, but cows. I have studied only till this much, moreover I have failed in the exams. I will get you good grades. Oh, so everything is ready. I don't know why, I feel scared. What if my husband comes to know about it? Throw him some food, he will calm down. He is not Anu's husband that I will throw food to him, he is Shruti's husband. Do you know what the common problem of ever woman is? No matter how many dreams you have, you hide it under your sad eyes. Just take a deep breath twice, you will get the courage. (Inhales sharply) (Laughs) (Exhales deeply) You are.. - (Laughs) (Music) "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "To cut the expensive fruits.." "Let's go happily.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." (Music) Sir, the car is an expensive one. Is the food expensive too? Sir, this is my first time. So, I will accept how much ever you give. The GST is not applicable, come on. - Give me some then. (Music) Three, four.. My God, is it really so profitable? The profit margin is more in food business. People would have become lazy if they didn't have a stomach. Now I know why my wife and dad always asked me to work hard for food. You are really a great cook! Why don't you come with me to the hotel? It's hard for me to manage alone. No, I won't come. My husband will cut and boil me if he comes to know about it. "When time calls, we should go.. We should understand its importance.." "A simple leniency is enough for our people, we should be very careful.." "We have worked hard.." "Now, let's reap the benefits.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." Hey, why are you so slow? - Sir, almost done. It's a waste to pay you guys. Make it soon. - Just a minute, sir. Is it ready? - Yes, sir. Say 'rolling' then. - Rolling, sir. Rolling? - Rolling, sir. Okay, I welcome you all to the special programme on food. Everyone knows how expensive Fortuner car is. A couple is selling North Karnataka food in the same Fortuner car in full fledge. Come, let us find out more about it. Hello, lady. - Hello. We have come to make your Hotel Fortuner famous. What are the dishes in your hotel? 'Jawar Roti', 'Palya' and 'Susla'. What do you want? - Superb! Are you the one who prepares food? - Yes, I prepare it and he sells it. He.. Oh, is he your husband? No, we just stay nearby. - Just stay nearby? What do you mean by that? - We are neighbours. Oh, so they are neighbours. - Don't you understand anything? Cover your face and stand aside. Show your face to the camera, not your back. He is the owner. - Sir, please don't shoot. Please turn the camera off. - What is the problem? Sir, please understand. Don't shoot, please. Don't touch the camera, I will shoot it. Shoot it, I will give the voice over if needed. Sir, you are not understanding it. You cover your face and stand aside. - Show your face, what's the problem? Sir, please don't shoot. Please try to understand. I won't understand, so what? - Sir, please don't shoot. Hey, give the camera here. - Don't touch the camera, return it. I won't! Return the camera. - Promise me that you won't shoot, then I will return it. I get paid to shoot things like these. - No, I won't return it. So, you won't return it. - No, I won't. Your restaurant name is Fortuner, right? I will change your entire fortune, idiot. Wait here, I will come back. Let's go, guys. How dare he snatch the camera! I will teach him a lesson. Sir, the camera.. - What were you doing when he snatched the camera? What kind of a cameraman are you? I will teach you a lesson today. I won't spare you. Hello, sir. It's me from TV5. Here's your money, the food was great! Will visit again. Sir? - What is it? They came. - Hello, sir. What are you looking at? Go and get the camera. My people are here. What do they think about the media professionals? Come aside, you people. - Sir, we are innocent. Why did you make a bomb hoax call? - Sir, none of us did it. Please, sir. Please let us go, sir. - This is how I teach lesson to people. Sir, I don't understand why you are doing this. Sir, what was our mistake that you have called the police? You that we are innocent. Sir, I have returned the camera, then what is the problem? Sir, please tell them to stop. Sir, please. - I'll hit you if you don't move. Move! Sir, why are you seizing my car? Please let it go, sir. Sir, what is this? We are not opposing anything.. ..but we just want to live, and live respectfully. We want that respect only from our spouses. - Exactly. Well, the sound of your language is really wonderful. Okay, I was there today and I somehow managed it.. ..but tomorrow someone else will be there, and they will misunderstand you. What if they create problems for your restaurant? I might not have learnt much from my father.. ..but I have learnt a lot from my aunt. She says that noble deeds are always accompanied with hurdles.. ..and that we should still cruise ahead. Superb! If everyone thinks like you, it would be great! Actually, I thought of inviting you both for panel discussion.. ..but we can do that later. First of all, let us correct what has gone wrong. First of all, let's go to the police station. What do you say? I will talk to them, you can resume your restaurant tomorrow. - Sure, sir. 'Oh, so they are neighbours. - Don't you understand anything?' 'Cover your face and stand aside.' 'Show your face to the camera, not your back.' 'He is the owner. - Sir, please don't shoot.' You don't worry. Come on, everybody is here. - Look, don't call and irritate me. Hey, what's this? - I'll call back. Haven't you taken a lunch break yet? - Not yet, sir. Come on, I will take you to a good restaurant. Anu, you also come. Come on. - Oh, free lunch! Ma'am, let's go for lunch. - No, you carry on. He will buy us lunch, come on. - I know that, you get lost! She is such a fool! Where is the owner? Why do you need to see the owner when the food is right here? There's special 'Jawar Roti'. - Serve five plates of it. Oh, sure. Please be seated, sir. Come soon. - Here you go, sir. You too, ma'am. Prepare more 'Rotis' from tomorrow because.. Let's go. What are you looking at? (Car engine starts) (Sighs) Sir, you said that you would return soon. There was so much work, you know? Dilip, you saved my honour! Here is Rs. 50 tip for Dilip who saved your honour! Wow! (Clapping) You should better change the title of this restaurant to 'Family Wreckage'. I didn't know your choice was so bad. Good luck! (Slaps) Stand with your head high at least for today. Don't be upset, it is my son who deserves to feel ashamed. Swamy, there is nothing to be ashamed of. First of all, get rid of your doubtful thoughts. When he was doing wrong, you supported him. Now, he is trying to do something in his life. You should actually be happy about it. She roams around with someone. God knows what all she is up to in the garb of business.. ..and you are asking me to let her stay with me! - Hold your tongue! Nothing as such has happened here. It's okay if the husband doesn't fight for her wife in the society.. ..but he shouldn't do something that humiliates her. Shruti is one in a million, she is as pure as fire. Then push her in fire. We will see what we should do if she comes out alive. As if you are as noble as Lord Sri Ram. I hate what he is doing and it is about my prestige! Stop shouting about your prestige. I wanted to smile wholeheartedly, but you made it worse with your colleagues. Partha! Partha, you don't understand girls. I have an idea, ask your dad for some money and start a restaurant. Stop meeting that girl. Sharada, I don't want him to weave his future with my money. You work in office and she sells food on streets, what's wrong in this? It is not about right and wrong. Just ask him if he will stop this or not. Why won't he stop it? He will definitely stop it, he should stop it for you. Why are you quiet? Why don't you try to talk sense into him? Don't listen to others.. ..there is a very thin line between love and doubting.. ..you can't erase it, but you should run your family taking care of it. If she agrees to live as my wife.. ..stop her nonsense business.. ..and remain home behind the closed door, yes. Will your family run well if he stop his business? We will see about that. We don't know what happens next. A woman should hide her wishes.. ..deep within her heart for the sake of her family. Stop that business and look after your family. Even I am trying to say the same. Consider this as a golden opportunity to correct your mistakes and stop it here. Go and tell this to that girl. Dad! - For the sake of your wife, go now. I have to talk to Partha about it. (Phone rings) Hello, Mr. Partha? Is the restaurant closed today? Yes, for permanently. Burn the name plate and give me the ashes.. ..so that my mom relishes it. People will always find an opportunity to comment on us. They misunderstand it even if we try to serve food as our livelihood. (Laughs) Even if a man and a woman roam together.. ..their imagination will go till bedroom. I am not able to convince my husband and mother-in-law. (Sighs) Let us stop this car restaurant here with a heavy heart. Instead, let us start a big restaurant. Have you brought your camera again, sir? - No, girl. I am trying to atone for my mistake. You have become an inspiration to the unemployed. We are getting a lot of calls at out TV station. So what should we do now? You don't have to do anything, I have a plan for you. You should just agree to it. Both of you will start a good restaurant.. ..I have convinced the Bank Manager to give you a loan. Just bring all your documents tomorrow, is that okay? Bye! Sir, should we really start a good restaurant? If I don't help people like you, God will punish me at the right time. I will wait for you in the bank tomorrow, come without fail. I have never had any bad intentions at you. - Neither have I! I have never tried to bother you. I have just worked hard. This is not fair, why is everyone misunderstanding us? It is their mistake, then why should we get the punishment? You are right. They are punishing us for their mistakes. When I was jobless, they called me names. Now that I am working hard, they are pointing a finger at my character. Yes, hard work never fails. We shouldn't be afraid of the bee sting if we want to taste the honey. We can find gold if we dig hard and deep. What do you think about starting the restaurant? Let the coin decide it. If it is heads, I will run the restaurant and you will be a helping hand. What if it is tails? - If it is tails.. ..you run the restaurant and I will be a helping hand. - Done! I want my husband and mother-in-law too. (Laughs) Even I want my wife. I have worked hard to convince her. I can't say that I will go away from her even as a joke. (Laughs) At least, now try to understand. Sharada, let's go. (Music) "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "To cut the expensive fruits.." "Let's go happily.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." (Music) "Let's have a goal.." "And work towards it.." "Let's think about the drawbacks too.." "And calculate our steps.." "Let's play this game called life.." "And win it.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." "Let's do something productive, my friend.." "Why waste time.." (Anklets tinkling) Looks like you have grown arrogant since you are earning well. How dare you enter my room! Why? Should I buy a token to enter my husband's room too? You are thinking too much and getting angry with me unnecessarily. Please have some sweets. Hey, I had maintained standards.. ..but you ruined it all by selling food on the streets with another man. You are earning through wrong means. What does that mean? - Do you want to know? Just understand who you are. Just understand what you are. Shame on you! (Laughs) You made me a laughing stock in the eyes of the society. They say that my wishes, dreams and deliberations are all fake.. ..and that anyone can fool me easily. You proved it so easily. You made me a fool! I know that you are hurt. You can shed tears if you feel like, at least I will wipe your tears. If you make fun of me at a time like this, it feels like stabbing my heart. I have worked hard to start this restaurant. It's okay if you can't support me, at least wish me luck. Wish? Wish! Wish you all the best! "No one is happy.." "Everyone's heart is full of sorrows.." "One should atone for his own sins.." "Why get angry on the God?" (Laughs) MES, looks like you couldn't sell the sweet at your house too. (Laughs) Are you waiting for a dog to give it away to him? Let me have it. It's all God's blessings. I don't think God really exists. I have never seen a person like my husband. (Laughs) How many husbands have you seen? Don't joke around now, I feel like crying. It has become common that we will have to take the medicine.. ..if they get a headache. What worse could have happened now that you are so hurt? Of course, I am hurt. He has never seen me like his wife. Do you even know what he said? No wife would want to hear it from her husband. I am not a demanding wife like other women.. ..I don't even ask him to bid me goodbye with a smile while he goes to office I don't even demand gold jewelry, I don't even want a lot of love. But just two sweet words are enough for me. The teachers who doesn't admit the kids to school.. ..do not give 100 marks to them in the exams. You are joking around again. I am not liking it. You talk so sweet when you are emotional. Shall I give you a free suggestion? If you talk like our Kannada serial actresses.. ..shedding tears as well as nose fluid.. ..you will look cuter. (Laughs) I don't want anything. Even if she comes to me and says that she has changed and she loves me.. ..I won't believe her. Her arrogance is more important to her, let her be like that. I just want her to understand who I am and how much I love her. Partha.. - It's okay. You are not good at consoling. When you are crying, you shouldn't try to wipe someone else's tears. I didn't want to say that, I was asking for the cup. (Door knocks) (Door knocks) (Door knocks) (Horn blares) Here you go, sir. What is it? - This one? Oh, a book on how to woo wives. Please, sir. Look at the modern times. It was not the same when my dad was young, he escaped. Now, do you realise how big an issue is wife? 'How to Woo Wives.' Whose wife, sir? Our own wife who makes our life hell. (Laughs) The wife who is holding our collars is not even letting us hold her feet. What happens if a jaggery ball is thrown in fire? It will melt and become soft. Read this book and start loving in a new way. No matter how rigid the wife is, her heart will melt. And you will get a baby in six months. If we make haste in planning babies, it is said that they will become fools. I am not in a hurry for children, sir. (Music) "You are like a lotus in the mud.." "You are like a lamp in the temple.." "You are like a lotus in the mud.." "You are like a lamp in the temple.." "You are like a lamp in the temple.." (Music) "You are like a calf dancing in the fields.." "You are like a calf dancing in the fields.." "You are a nectar like a mother's milk.." "You are a nectar like a mother's milk.." "You are like a lotus in the mud.." "You are like a lamp in the temple.." (Music) "You are like the voice of the peacock dancing in a flower garden.." "You are like the fragrance of the flower in the garden.." "You are like the fragrance of the flower in the garden.." "You...only you.." "You are like the fragrance of the flower in the garden.." "You are like the fragrance of the flower in the garden.." We are here to enjoy. Forget all your problems and enjoy the party. Only to encourage you people, we organise such parties. Cheers! Have some beer. Taste some beer, it tastes good. My Hostel Security used to say that it tastes like donkey piss. Excuse me. Hey, sorry guys. - Come on, sir. Okay, we can go. Not a problem. Let's go. We can go. Enjoy! Cheers! - Thank you. I can understand your situation and feelings. Here, drink some. - It's okay, sir. This is for you, have it. Just look at her. Then you will understand how to take the problems your wife.. ..has created for you in a positive way. Did you get me? Sir, just because our time is bad, we can't act like animals. I have scanned Anu the first day she joined. (Chuckles) You express it to everyone, but I don't...that's the only difference. Then what are you waiting for? See, Anu's husband has pouched your wife. So, why don't you try to pouch Anu? You are wasting time thinking nonsense. Sir, actually.. - Listen! The iron is hot, this is the right time. Go and talk to her. I said, talk to her. Go ahead. (Slaps) (Slaps) Look at you, shameless! What did you say to her? Don't you know that I am already married? Even I am married, but what's the use? You are looking for your husband in me indirectly.. ..but you are not realising it. So am I. I always wanted a wife like you.. Oh, sorry. I wanted you to be my wife. (Sighs) I think, this is the right time. Scoundrel! - (Slaps) I didn't think Swamy is wrong here. It is Anu's mistake. Are you nuts? Don't use your political ideas here. You are making the situation worse. How can he talk like that to our daughter-in-law? Don't talk nonsense and ruin my son's family. I have enquired in their company. He doesn't want to accept that village girl as his wife. Whereas, she never wanted a good-for-nothing husband like your son. Even if we force them, we can't change their heart. It is impossible. Swamy always liked Anu. Rascal! - (Slaps) How dare you eye someone else's wife! I think, if they don't like to run a family with the one they have got married to.. ..they can stay with whoever they like. What are you even saying? - Shut up! First of all, you and your son stop living the life of a pity. Once they calm down, their families will be fine. That is your misconception. What do you say, ma'am? I have nothing to say, this rascal has already said everything. I leave everything to their own wishes. As they think. What do you have to say, Swamy? If she is ready, I am ready to get married to her. What do you all think of me? Don't I have a heart and dreams? I thought, I will have a beautiful life with the person I loved.. ..but he made me a laughing stock. Now, you all are humiliating me. No, dear. Even I don't know if I am alive or already dead! Anu.. I want Anu, Dad. Please don't discuss this in front of me ever! Even I don't want to be a villain in your life, son. Sharada, let's go. Partha.. Delicious! The food is really tasty. All thanks to your training. She manages everything. That is why, the food is so tasty. - I only prepare food.. ..but he does all the cleaning, washing, maintaining etc. Only because of his help, we could run this restaurant. (Laughs) There is no use surrendering to your problems. We should find solution to them ourselves. Shruti, you tell his wife the truth. You explain it to my son. Even the stones melt, then why can't people's hearts? This is what I call an idea! This is not even expensive. This will definitely work. That is why, it is said that a old woman in the family is necessary. (Laughs) I never expected this. I received an escalation mail from the management. This is disgusting! We are getting humiliated in the production environment. Shame on us! I need the root cause for this. Please reply by mail. Get out now! If anyone is not interested in working in my team, you can just get out! Any, what happened? What's the problem? Don't ask me, ask him. Swamy, what happened? - How would I know? Ask that woman. - Hey, mind your tongue. There is a problem between us, but don't bring it to office. Otherwise, I will have to teach you a lesson. Strange! So, you will teach me a lesson? Go ahead and teach me. Your husband must be teaching some other lesson to my wife. Teach a lesson to your wife before pointing finger at my husband. Shut up, both of you. You both are creating a scene. Please sort out your personal problems at home.. ..it looks disgusting to discuss it in the office. Isn't he talking disgusting? Oh, so your husband is not disgusting, he is interesting? You are crossing your limits now. I will kick you out of my project! You and your attitude! God has given you this darned life only because of your attitude. Yes, I have an attitude. Didn't you know that when you were ogling at me secretly? You don't even deserve to stand in front of me. At least, you don't talk about deserving. You deserve a MLA's son, whereas you are too good for me, right? What is this? Come here. - What did I do? - You go to that house. Wait here quietly. (Door knocks) (Clouds rumbling) Sister Anu, are you home? Sister Anu? Sister Anu, are you home? Sister Anu? Sister.. Why have you come at this hour? Partha is not home. I came to talk to you, Sister. Your husband talked a lot in the office, have you come to add up to my woes? Sister Anu, I have come to talk about Partha. Who are you to address me as sister? After all, who are you to talk about Partha? Partha is a very nice person, he loves you a lot.. - Please leave! You don't have to tell me about Partha, I know everything about him. He loves you with all his heart, please try talking to him once. He is waiting for you to talk to him. He started a restaurant for you, but when I asked him to stop it, he didn't. Now, what can he do for me? He didn't start the restaurant for me, but for you. You stupid fool! Do you think you can convince me with your sweet words? He is working hard to deserve your love and to make the lie a truth. He is not able to look into your eyes as he had lied to you.. ..but he is waiting that you will understand him and love him. He knows me better than you. - He can do anything for you. Instead of you, if he had said all this to me, it would have been better. He is hesitating because he has hurt you. Please try talking to him once. If you are ready to live with him happily.. ..I will go away from the restaurant business. Forget that, but Sister Anu is a very nice girl. She is not at all angry with you, she wants to talk to you. Really? Are you telling the truth, MES? What did you tell her? But your husband is quite rigid. I told him that you are a very sweet woman.. ..and that he will know what you are only if he tries to see it. You should be fortunate to have a wife like her. I am unfortunate, I don't want anything. You take that fortune along. I am sorry. - It's okay. He will realise someday, I am sure. You go ahead. - Okay. Oh, here you are! I have a lot to talk with you. Let's sit and talk. What are you doing? Anu, you are making me feel uncomfortable. Please don't change all of a sudden, I won't be able to tolerate it. Hurt me or love me, but in installments. I am not strong enough to take it all at a time. First of all, stop staring at me and tell me what you want to. Why do you like me? What can I say if you ask me all of a sudden? It is hard. It's okay, tell me why you like me. When I didn't know what I was, I had a reason. When I decided to marry you, I had a different reason. When you didn't leave me even after knowing the truth, I had many reasons to love you. When you shed tears in the corner, I had many other reasons to love you. When you didn't even look at my face despite staying at the same house.. ..I loved you in a different way. Now, when you are staring at me constantly, I have a reason to love you. Only the maturity level of my love for you is changing, but not love for you. I want you, I want only you! You should stay with me and keep threatening me! But if you say that you would leave me alone, I will really die! It's not important how much you love me.. ..and I don't even want to ask that at this stage.. ..but I am still not able to come over your betrayal. You said that you would die without me.. ..the give me one reason to stay with me. (Phone rings) Bloody rascal! (Clouds rumbling) Do you know what your partner told me? She told me that you can do anything for me.. ..but I am not sure of it. Anu, I am ready to do anything for you. You shouldn't break your promise. Are you ready to do anything? We have come so far, at least now believe me. Will you leave me because I want freedom from you? I want to go away forever tomorrow. You shouldn't try to convince me. Not you, not your dad or mom, no one should try to convince me. I feel ashamed to say to the court that I am married to you. Please do not show your face for divorce formalities. I am not sure if I wanted it, but I have got a lot from you. I don't understand how to return it to you. You can ask anything if you want. Are you expecting anything from me? If you want, I am ready to sleep with you. Will you ask me what I ask for? Promise me that you won't laugh. Before you go, I will prepare food for you. No matter how bad it tastes.. ..please have it and tell me once that it tastes delicious. (Crying) My son loves you a lot, Anu. Please don't hurt him. Every time you shed a tear, it hurt him. He is our son.. ..so he is committed like his dad as well as staggering like me. He is such a person.. ..that he makes everyone cry while he laughs. Mom, are you done? Make it fast, the cab is already waiting. Anu.. Anu, please don't go. (Crying) Uncle, you were right. I don't deserve to stay in a well-to-do family like yours. I argued a lot with you that day. Please forgive me. Sometimes, we say 'see you' to people we don't even know. You have done a lot for me, my ego hurts to say 'see you' to you. The food was delicious. You are the reason for it. If you ever blame me, I will kill you. Anu! Okay, go away! Do you think you are a Celestial nymph? Do you think my son won't live without you? You don't deserve to live with my son! "The heart is suffocating.." "Without love, the heart is giving up.." "The heart is yearning.." "The heart is yearning for her touch.." (Music) "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." "Without her, I have no life.." "Please understand my pain.." "I made a mistake, but whom should I confess it to?" "After she left me, what would I even want?" "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." "Without her, I have no life.." "Please understand my pain.." (Music) "I agree I lied, you could have corrected me.." "I apologised to you so many times, you could have forgiven me only once.." "Amidst the roar of the silence, the heartbeats are not heard.." "You asked questions, but never wanted the answers.." "With the tear drops, the words ended.." "Oh, my God.. I better die.." "Oh, my God.. I better die.." "Oh, my God.. I better die.." "Oh, my God.. I better die.." Shruti? Shruti, where are you? Shruti? Shruti? Where are you? Where did you go? Where should I look for you? I have been looking for you everywhere. Oh, God! Where did she go? Swamy, where has Shruti gone? She is not around. I am talking to you, wait there! Can't you hear me? Shruti is not seen since morning. Hey, insensitive guy! Then say thanks to our family deity. What are you even saying, rascal? Thank God, at least now He understood my situation and feelings. Are you thanking God since your wife has gone missing? It has been six months that we got married, she has never been like my wife. You have never been a husband to her either. If she starts a secret family with Partha, how can I be a husband to her? Go and check, she must be with him. (Slaps) (Horn blares) (Horn blares) Hey, come on out! What is it, sir? - Come on out, I said! First of all, leave my collar. Oh, really? You scoundrel, what have I ever done to you? What have I done, you rascal? Are you proud of your father's connections and your complexion? You idiot Swamy, you dissatisfied soul! I feel like breaking your legs, but I am quiet because you are Shruti's husband. Partha! Let my son go! - Let my hand go, you rascal! Let me son go! Get lost! Swamy, why are you fighting? What's wrong? Hope you are all right, Partha. - Come on, fight me! Yes, everything I have is yours. You can't even control your wife and you dare to hit my son! His dad will get you bashed up! - Of course, he will! - Move back! (Slaps) Mother, are you really idiot? At least, now understand my situation and feelings. He is the one who misled your daughter-in-law, why are you slapping me? Hey! - No one understands my situation and feelings. You got a street food vendor to hit a software engineer. Go to hell! Go to hell, everyone! Swamy! - Hey lost! - You are responsible for everything. Partha, let's go home. - Aunt, what is all this? Partha! - Where is Shruti? Let's go. - I didn't see her since morning. Partha! - Come on then, let's find her. Why would you find her? How are you related to her? Let's go home. - Mom, let me go! Shruti is an innocent girl, what if she harms herself unknowingly? Partha, let them do whatever they want. - Please let's go and find her. The worst case scenario would be that she will die, that's it. Let her die. How would it make any difference to you? You just take care of your own family. I will see what I have to. - Let's go. Her husband doesn't want her, no one wants her.. ..her death won't mean anything to anyone. What is this, MES? Mother-in-law told me to lock myself in the room.. ..and she will make my husband concerned for me.. ..so I was quiet. Let's go to the restaurant, Dilip can't handle it all alone. (Car engine starts) Please try again. Please try again. The card is not getting accessed, it's my log in time. Check what the problem is. Excuse me, sir. May I know your name? - Guruswamy. Can I have your ID, please? It's my log in time, what.. - Please be seated, I will check. Sir, only two minutes. Mr. Guruswamy? - Yes. I am Pallavi from the HR Department. Can I have your laptop, please? - Sure. Hope this laptop doesn't have your personal data. No, no. - Okay. I have my personal laptop for that. - All right, Mr. Guruswamy. So, you must be aware of the cost-optimisation.. ..that's happening across the company. So, that list has your name. If you are ready to put down your papers today.. ..we'll consider it as a normal exit. Otherwise, we will have to give you a termination letter.. ..and then don't expect any benefits from us. Thank you. What did you just say? Are you kidding me? What's your name? - I am Pallavi from HR. Pallavi, you can't do this. I have been working here for three years. I even got the Best Employee award last year. Don't you have a heart? - Listen, listen.. I am not authorised to give you an extension or something else. I am just here to complete your exit formalities. - Oh, God! You just wait, I will call the higher authority. Then you can talk to him. No use calling anyone. - No, I will call. Just wait. This is happening as per the contract you have signed. - Okay, I agree that. Just wait, the line is getting connected. See, whether or not you have to stay in the company.. ..is completely company's decision. It's clearly mentioned in the contract letter. Didn't you read the contract-letter before signing it? (Phone rings) Hello? What! Which hospital? Just understand where your lives are leading to. Why did you want to die just because someone fired you? Losing a job is not like the end of your life. The computer is going to yield you only money, not peace. Learn to identify between computers and human beings. Learn to love people. Look at her face once. No one can love you as selflessly as her. At least, now understand who is on your side. Drink it, rascal! For how long are you going to force him? I don't want him, I can't take it anymore. It's you who have got me caught in this. If you are okay with it, let me live with you. If you feel like I am a burden to you, let me go. I will go somewhere. Actually, it was your name in the cost-optimisation list.. ..but I fought for you and got Swamy terminated. How can I retrain myself when he ogles at you in front of me? I did it for you. Only for you. Oh, God! Are you really going away from my son? Your plan didn't work, so I have started a new plan. What are you doing here? You are still the same, aren't you? At least, do you know what you are up to? How could you believe that I love you? If you are angry with someone, you can hide it behind a smile. But you can't hide love behind anger for too long. Do you know something? Whoever wanted to live carefully with me are treating me carelessly. Your love stands no chance in front of my pain. You are so egoistic, aren't you? You are still arrogant, aren't you? You shouldn't let your tongue loose just because someone is ready to listen. Everyone is busy with their own work. No one has the patience and time to care for someone else. Everyone is fake here. No matter what we do, they will find only weakness. They try to play games with us with that weakness.. ..but only if we entertain it. Why do you entertain such people? Am I not concerned for you? Am I not trying to know how you are? Why are you hurting me just because someone else was careless towards you? I will kill you! Let me cry peacefully. Everyone made look like a villain. Didn't I stay with you even after you fooled me? Couldn't you understand my love then? But what did you do? What did you do? You left me for Shruti. I feel like dying! (Crying) If you had let me sleep on your chest only once and apologised to me.. ..I would have got convinced. Where is your partner? She went back to her village with her mother-in-law. Great then! Let's close that stupid restaurant and start a posh restaurant! Anyway, I have resigned from my job. You did great! Let's do that! Partha, I am not liking it. Sister Anu is calling our restaurant stupid and you are okay with it. Just because your wife came into your arms, you are ready to shut the restaurant down. I am a partner to the restaurant. Sister Anu, you can work with us if you want. Shame on you! Did you start lying again? She was the one who told me that you are not normal.. ..and that I should lie to you to convince you. I swear! (Screams) MES, what the heck! You don't know how to talk to your wife. You should talk to your wife wholeheartedly. - Oh, shut up! She doesn't understand simple words, forgetting understand the feelings. Hey, attitude queen! You are the heroine of my life, don't act like a villain. If you get angry for every little thing, our entire life would fade away. I am planning kids. Anu, sorry! "I followed her till eternity, she never looked back.." "I called her like it was my duty, she never answered.." "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." "You entered my life like the sunrise.." "You are the heroine for my life story.." "Your steps are like dance moves, your bangles rhythm is like music.." "Your words are like a music, sing it in my ears.." "Be the dance or trance, take my heart away.." "Oh, my God.." "I better die.." "Without her, I have no life.." "Please understand my pain.." "I feel like I have failed for the first time.." "Like the red signal in the traffic.." "Like the answer that never flashes during the exam.."
