DIE ABENTEURER GMBH "ADVENTURES INC." ("The Spy 313") On board the freighter Herculania, which has run on the rocks, are two members of a spy service of a European state... ...known for their courage and daring: Janette Finné and her brother Georges, designated Spy 313 by the Secret Service. "Be careful, Janette, for we've been watched during the entire crossing." "And above all, don't forget that this letter contains a secret document of the highest importance, ...which has to be handed over to the chief of staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at all cost." Tony Huderg ess Joe Igituoisie und Piere Lafitte na Harquis isi Bevergere [Ri]ta van de[n] Meer nd Herga ina Bivespos J(e)annette Finne "Do you know if my brother was saved?" "You are really very good to me, madam." "You need care after so much suffering...I want to take you to spend some days with me." "So it's understood then, little one, you will be my guest." "We have to find the document; the chief demands it." At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the chief of staff has not received the expected document and makes an inquiry. "Do you know where Janette Finné, who was among the rescued, could be found?" "Help me, if you please! The door is so hard to open..." "She has lost her mind, it's plain." "I will bring her to reason!" The shipwreck of the Herculania List of victims... Those saved... ...Georges Finné... "And you, do you know where Janette Finné could be?" "Have you not noticed if her brother or her handed a letter, of which here is a picture?" "I have never seen neither the gentleman or his sister." "Bravo, Pierre! I congratulate you on having escaped from death so miraculously." "But yes, Lucienne. You know that luck is with the rotten." "There, I am already searching for a new employment." "While waiting, let's have lunch together." "Only, Lucienne, my means don't allow me to accompagny you to the Savoy." "I've done all jobs, my dear Pierre. Subsequently I've been... ...librarian, typist, reporter, nanny, cinema pianist, reader for a man who craved love. I even tried the cloister." "That's like me, my life has been one series of trials. We're both great adventurers." "Pierre, you have nothing. Me, even less. With that capital, we should start a company." "I have adventurer's blood in my veins. When you're young and bold, you can do anything, so long as honour isn't lost." "How shall we call our company?" JANETTE FINNÉ, WHERE ARE YOU? Provide us information through this paper. Large reward for information. "Our name? Simply "Adventurers' Club". And as our first case we will find Jannette Finné." "Until tomorrow at one, then... We shall ascertain what to do to recover the disappeared." "I heared your conversation just now at the restaurant without wanting to." "Perhaps I could be of use to your Adventurers' Club. Will you listen to me?" "So you've become a captain of industry overnight?" "Indeed. I've received money to conceal something I didn't know one word about." C. Wittington Director General of the Esthonie Glass Factories "In summary, what offer do you want to make to the Adventurers' Club?" "If you abandon the Finné case, you can make a lot of money." "If you know something about Jannette Finné, and if you do not keep silent, beware!" "Beware, yourself: it is known that I am here!" "What is the price of your silence?" "I expect you here tomorrow, you and your partner." "All this seems very complicated. Still we take this money. It will be the first daily funds for the Adventurers' Club." "Are you not mistaken in the floor? You don't seem to remember this place." After this little incident, the Adventurers' Club held its first general assembly. "To your health, my little air acrobat." "I think that you have had enough of adventures? Wouldn't it be better if we informed the police of what we know?" "Well, providing you want it, we'll continue the adventure by placing an advert in the paper, as follows: "If you wish to know about Janette Finné, apply to the Adventurers' Club. Write the editors of the paper." We shall see..." The next day, several people took an interest in the advert. Having read your advert, I would be much obliged if you call on me as soon as possible. Georges Herward, Savoy Hotel Your advert concerning Janette Finné has my interest. Could you receive me soon? Yours sincerely, Rita van den Meer. The chief of staff of the special service at the ministry of foreign affairs, Marlin. "All this seems to me a bit fantastical, mister president of the Adventurers' Club." "Nevertheless I am at your disposition as soon as you learn anything new." "That one is not taking us seriously. Let's see the next one." Having read your advert, I would be much obliged if you call on me as soon as possible. Georges Herward, Savoy Hotel "So, what do you know about Janette Finné?" "Why do you take an interest in her?" "Janette Finné and her brother are relations of me." "That is why I wanted to make your acquintance." "What those two young people told you, my dear Marlin, is probably just the product of their imagination!" "You know, Monsieur Verdier, that the secret document was not recovered with the body of Spy 313." "...and that until now his sister has not been located yet?" "So, it's very clear: There's an obvious connection between the disappearance of the document and that of the sister." "That little walk over the roofs and the sudden bath made us decide to pursue this mysterious affair." "Courage and love for adventure is our only capital for the moment." "Would you like me in your club as financier?" "Now, we're going to visit the third person, who is interested in Janette Finné." "My car is of course at the disposal of the Adventurers' Club." "That man, who leaves the house of Rita van der Meer, is Wittington. Strange..." "Wait for me at Herward." "No doubt someone will ask for me... I am upstairs." "This time, you won't kick us downstairs." "No use lying... We're very well informed on you..." "On the Herculania you were a stoker. But in reality, you're an officer and a spy." "You have risked your life for nothing, because the secret document is already in our hands." "Come on! Don't play games! If I am your guest now, it's because you want to make me tell where the document is." "Well, where is the document?" "Give me ten thousand dollars, and my freedom, and I will get it for you." "Perfect. Our chef will decide." "I'm convinced that the prisonner knows nothing about the document. He has simply lead you on!" "And Janette Finné? Is she still silent?" "I'm beginning to get very worried concerning Pierre. What could have happened to him?" "I know that Verdier, the minister, takes a great interest in that document. Let's go to him. He will surely help us." "You are the cousin of Janette Finné, the one who disappeared?" "Why didn't you inform the police?" "I've preferred to investigate myself." "Since Wittington exited with Mrs. Van der Meer, the woman is suspect. She must be able to tell us where he currently is." "You must go and see her before alerting the police." "Do you want us to go there all three this evening?" "Search discretely, and wihtout delay, Herward, at the Savoy Hotel, room 147." "You're under suspicion. You must disappear immediately." "We shall wait for the arrival of Monsieur Verdier, the minister." "Listen, I'm going to tell you the while truth..." "She was going to confess it all when you entered. Careful, she will escape." "Lift that grate, and you will find yourself in the open air." "I've come from their hideaway... You must send a police squad down there immediately." "The nest is empty... That was to be expected!" The document that you seek is buried at the foot of milestone on the road of Saint Georges to Vaumont. Burn this paper because if it was known that I gave you this information then my life would be in danger. "Young man, I see that you burn with desire to go get the document. We shall place some officers at your disposal." "If I find the document, I'll get a very big reward, and then we can marry!" "My dear Herward, I entrust Lucienne to you during me absence." "The others have already left... Now I will make Janette Finné leave town." "It's essential that Lucienne Fermont disappears at the same time." The hunt for the document... TELEGRAM I await you at six, St.Georges station. Pierre TELEGRAM I await you at six, St.Georges station. Pierre I've gone to collect Pierre. Lucienne. No use persisting in searching the secret document, it's already in our possession. "Lucienne! Lucienne!" TELEGRAM I await you at six, St.Georges station. Pierre "Miss Fermont made me take a ticket for St. Georges." "Lucienne has disappeared... and that telegram is not from me." "Moreover, I have no idea where Herward is." "But that is the young lady who has made me escape..." "Pierre Lafitte sends you this car." "Take these ladies to Minister Verdier. They will notify him about everything." "You're going crazy, Pierre. Who do you take me for?" "You are the chef of the spies!" "This is madness... You told me to take care of Lucienne, that's why I've followed her until here." "And the second girl in your car? I've already seen her with the bandits..." "This man calls himself Herward..." "I've unmasked him; because at the moment he wanted to take Lucienne, he had with him the young girl... ...who had enabled my escape, but who was no less a part of the gang of spies." "Me? But I do not know that girl..." "This photo is of my cousin Janette Finné?" "Was it her who in my car? It all went so fast that I did not recognize her! ...Besides, she had never seen me, and I only knew her from her portrait." "But just say your name... You can speak in full confidence before Monsieur the minister." "My name is Janette Finné." "But you are going crazy, poor man! Suspecting Mr. Verdier is the height of stupidity!" "Herward may be right... Think: the document in question may have brought to light diplomatic transgressions... Verdier attempted to remove the letter to avoid the fall from the ministry." "Recall: it's Verdier himself who had sent me to the milestone, while his accomplices lured Lucienne into a trap." "To escape their interrogations and their threats, I pretended to have lost my mind and memory." "But then where did you hide the secret document that your brother passed to you?" "Let's go there quickly to get it." ARREST WARRANT "At this moment, Verdier, accompanied by the two girls, is entering the building where the bandits were hiding." "So they're in his power... Let's hurry to save them, while there's still time!" "You've caused me a lot of trouble... But I've finally reached my goal... The only thing left is to make you disappear, for you truly know too much!" "...and I will be found wounded. No-one will think to go and search for the document with Verdier, the minister!" The end.
