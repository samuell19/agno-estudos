( laughing ) I WILL BUILD IT, THOUGH, AT A COST OF $19 BILLION, THE BIGGEST PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IN THE HISTORY OF CHICAGO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE RICHARD J. DALY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. Woman: THE RICHARD J. DALY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WILL BE THE WORLD'S MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FACILITY. IT WILL CREATE OVER 60,000 JOBS AND PROVIDE $15 BILLION ANNUALLY TO CHICAGO'S ECONOMY. THE CROWN JEWEL IN THIS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, ENERGY-EFFICIENT COMPLEX WILL BE THE NEW SOLDIER FIELD, THE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL STADIUM THE CITY HAS BEEN EAGERLY AWAITING FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS. AND NOW, MY GOOD FRIEND, MAYOR FRANCISCO MELENDEZ, WHOSE VISION CONCEIVED IT AND WHOSE STATESMANSHIP WILL SEE IT THROUGH. ( greeting ) DAVID MICHAEL CORLISS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHO DISPROVES THE MYTH THAT YOU CANNOT TRUST A MAN WITH THREE NAMES. ( laughing ) BUILDING THE DALY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WILL REAFFIRM THIS CITY'S PROUD POSITION AS THE TRANSPORTATION HUB OF AMERICA AND LAUNCH THE MIDWEST INTO THE 21st CENTURY. THIS GOOF STICKS A GUN IN IRON JOHN'S FACE. SAYS, "GIVE ME YOUR MONEY." SO JOHN TAKES THE GUN AWAY FROM HIM, SMACKS HIM AROUND, AND THAT'S THAT. A WEEK LATER, SOME OTHER CLOWN STICKS A GUN IN IRON JOHN'S BACK. SAYS, "GIVE ME YOUR MONEY." IRON JOHN KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST, TAKES THE GUN AWAY, AND BEATS HIM WITHIN AN INCH OF HIS LIFE. SO I SAYS TO JOHN, "HEY, WHAT'S THE GAFF? BOTH GUYS TRIED TO ROB YOU." IRON JOHN SAID, "THE FIRST GUY "APPROACHED ME LIKE A MAN, FROM THE FRONT. THE SECOND WAS A COWARD." HERE, HERE! WHO'S IRON JOHN? IRON JOHN WAS MY FATHER. A GREAT MAN. FOR 20 YEARS, THE REAL CLOUT IN THIS TOWN. JUST LIKE JACK IS NOW, RIGHT, JACK? YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. WOLF LAKE. WHAT ABOUT WOLF LAKE?

I GOTTA HAVE MY OWN, SEPARATE FROM THE AIRPORT'S. THAT'S NOT UP TO ME, DEDE. DON'T VISE ME, DAVID. YOU'RE TALKING FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDS. TWO YEARS AGO, PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN DIDN'T WANT YOUR GODDAMN AIRPORT. NOW, WHAT CHANGED THEIR MINDS? THE HERALD, S.T. MY PAPER, MY TV STATION. YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY GETTING SHAFTED.

FOR THREE DAYS, COPPERS ARE BUSTING HEADS ALL OVER TOWN. SO, DALY CALLS A PRESS CONFERENCE. HE'S GONNA STRAIGHTEN THE WHOLE THING OUT. THE FIRST WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH ARE, "GENTLEMEN, GET THE THING STRAIGHT "ONCE AND FOR ALL. EXCUSE ME. "THE POLICEMAN ISN'T THERE TO CREATE DISORDER. THE POLICEMAN IS THERE TO PRESERVE DISORDER!" ( laughing ) I DON'T GET IT. ( men clearing throats ) I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU LATER. EXCUSE ME. JACK... I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT EXPRESSWAY RAMPS FOR SOLDIER FIELD. DEDE, WHEN I GET TO WASHINGTON, I'LL SIT DOWN WITH THE GUYS FROM TRANSPORTATION, WAYS AND MEANS. WON'T BE EASY, BUT YOU'LL GET YOUR RAMPS. YOU CAN MAKE IT FLY IN SPRINGFIELD, RIGHT, JACK? YES.

YOUR NECK SHOULD'VE BEEN BROKEN AND YOUR SPINAL CORD SEVERED, BUT THEY WEREN'T. WHY? LEAVE THAT TO THE MONSIGNOR. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME? IN MEDICAL TERMS, YOU HAVE CENTRAL CORD SYNDROME. THE IMPACT COMPRESSED AND PINCHED YOUR CERVICAL SPINE AT C4-5. HERE. THAT'S WHY YOU WERE PARALYZED. YOUR NERVES WERE TEMPORARILY CUT OFF. TEMPORARILY? WE'LL HAVE TO KEEP YOU HERE FOR A FEW DAYS. YOU'LL GO HOME IN A WHEELCHAIR. HAVE TO WEAR THAT COLLAR FOR A WHILE. WITH TIME AND SOME PHYSICAL THERAPY, FULL RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE. OH, GOD. GOD. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THESE INJURIES, MR. KILLORAN. SQUEEZE. YEAH. ( chuckles ) IT'S ALWAYS NICE WHEN ONE HAS A HAPPY ENDING. Radio: ALL UNITS IN ABOVE-TOWN AREA, WE HAVE A BURGLARY IN PROGRESS AT 2752 N. MILWAUKEE AVENUE. Cop: I GO-- I GOT IT.

I THINK YOU CAN START REMOVING THE COLLAR FOR TWO HOURS TOMORROW, FOUR HOURS THE DAY AFTER, AND SO ON, BUT YOU SHOULD STILL WEAR IT WHENEVER YOU'RE IN A CAR. DOCTOR, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU. NOT SO FAST, JOHN. WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK YOUR LIFE HAS TO CHANGE? YOU GOTTA TAKE IT EASY-- NO CONTACT SPORTS, NO HORSEBACK RIDING OF ANY KIND. NOTHING THAT COULD JAR OR STRAIN YOUR NECK. BUT NOT FOREVER, RIGHT? SIX MONTHS, A YEAR FROM NOW, WE'LL SEE, BUT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP. THE SPINAL CORD IS LIKE THE BRAIN. THE CELLS DON'T REGENERATE. WHATEVER THE DAMAGE, IT'S PERMANENT. A WHACK THAT WOULD GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A HEADACHE, COULD KILL YOU. ( chattering on phones ) ( workers gasping ) USUALLY WHEN I COME IN, EVERYONE PRETENDS TO WORK HARDER. ( laughing ) GRASTA NE DHIO, MR. K. BY THE GRACE OF GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT? AN ANGEL FLEW BY AND JUST BRUSHED YOU WITH HIS WING. IS THAT RIGHT. THOSE MY CALLS?

KILLORAN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE PHYSICAL CRISIS HAS PASSED, BUT YOU STILL FEEL THE NEED TO CONFESS. AM I RIGHT? MONSIGNOR, I HAVE TO TALK TO SOMEONE. THERE'S NO ONE I TRUST. THAT IS SAD. NO, THAT'S CHICAGO. ( chuckles ) A SYMBOL OF GOD'S PRESENCE. POMBE. HONEY BEER. I BREW IT MYSELF. IN THE BASEMENT. ( laughing ) ( bells tolling ) AH! MM? IT'S NOT BAD. A VESTIGE OF BUSH LIFE FROM KENYA. IN KENYA, THERE IS POVERTY EVERYWHERE. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. THERE IS NO SHAME IN IT. THUS, PEOPLE DO NOT LET THEIR PRIVATION KEEP THEM FROM ENJOYING LIFE. WELL, IT'S NOT THAT WAY HERE. MM! NET WORTH IS EVERYTHING HERE. IT IS SAID POMBE WILL LOOSEN THE TONGUE OF THE MOST DISCREET MAN. MY FATHER WAS THE FIXER BEFORE ME. YOU KNOW THE WORD "FIXER"? NO. CHICAGO IS A CLOSED SOCIETY. ALWAYS HAS BEEN. IT RUNS LIKE THE FINGERS ON YOUR HAND-- POLITICIANS, POLICE, BIG BUSINESS, ORGANIZED CRIME-- AND THE FIXER IS LIKE THE THUMB. HE CAN TOUCH ANY FINGER, OR ALL THE FINGERS, MORE EASILY THAN THEY CAN TOUCH EACH OTHER DIRECTLY. THAT WAS MY FATHER. I SEE. FROM DAY ONE, HE BROUGHT ME UP TO TAKE HIS PLACE. THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION. I WAS HIS SON. YOU DON'T QUESTION, YOU JUST DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO KEEP THINGS RUNNING. BUT NOW YOU DO QUESTION. YES. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU QUESTION? EVERYTHING. WELL, THEN, YOU MUST TELL ME EVERYTHING. YOU RATIONALIZE. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TO GO AROUND, SO YOU PROTECT YOUR OWN. EVERYBODY ELSE, JOE CITIZEN, THE SQUARES WITH NO CLOUT, THEY LOSE. TOUGH SHIT. ONLY SUCKERS BEEF. YOU THINK ABOUT THE DAMAGE YOU PREVENT, NOT THE DAMAGE YOU CAUSE. BUT NOT ANYMORE. I CAME THIS CLOSE... I WAS FORCED TO THINK. THE MEANING OF MY-- MY LIFE... ETERNAL JUDGMENT... ALL THOSE THINGS YOU NEVER WANNA FACE. THE DEAD GIRL. I DUMPED HER BODY LIKE IT WAS NOTHING. TYRELL HOLMES, I PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPLY HIM. I MEAN... ( sobs ) EVERYWHERE I TURN... GO ON, MY SON. MY WIFE, UH, DOESN'T CARE. MY SON, WHO'VE I'VE TRIED TO KEEP OUT OF THIS... WANTS TO BE A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK. I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE DOING WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME, BUT IT'S GONE WAY TOO FAR. I CAN'T GO BACK. I TRIED. I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE. I'M GOOD. THEN YOU MUST STOP. YEAH, AND THEN I'LL BE ELECTED POPE. YOU DON'T GET IT, MONSIGNOR. REMEMBER JOHN CHAPTER EIGHT, VERSE 32? "YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE." MONSIGNOR, THE TRUTH WILL GET MY KILLED. "'WOE IS ME. I AM DOOMED,' CRIED ISAIAH, 'FOR I AM A MAN OF UNCLEAN LIPS.'" THAT IS WHEN THE LORD CAME TO HIM. IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS DESPAIR-- THE LORD CAME TO HIM. YES, HE CAME TO HIM, AS HE WILL COME TO YOU. YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THIS, MR. KILLORAN, BUT NOW, IN YOUR PAIN AND SUFFERING AND CONFUSION, YOU ARE CLOSER TO GOD THAN I WILL EVER BE. YOU MUST TRUST IN HIM. HE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY. WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, MONSIGNOR. IRENE. DAVID CORLISS AGAIN. UH-HUH. JACK IS STILL NOT IN? ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M STILL ON THE MOBILE. THANKS. JACK! I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU, BABE. WHAT? I'M GIVING YOU YOUR MONEY BACK.

THIS IS YOURS AS WELL. THE FUCK! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? I'M OUT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, YOU'RE OUT? I AM OUT. I'LL SAY YOU'RE OUT. YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND. YOU WANT TO FIX A MURDER CASE, DO IT YOURSELF. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. Cop: THEY STOLE A PORSCHE AND CRACKED IT UP. BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE, YOUR SON WAS THE ONLY ONE STILL IN THE CAR. WAS HE HURT? BUMP ON THE HEAD. HE WOULDN'T BEEF ON HIS PARTNERS. MAYBE THEY WERE JUST JOYRIDING, BUT HAD A LOT OF HIGH-END SPORTS CARS END UP IN CHOP SHOPS LATELY. I UNDERSTAND. JOHNNY. LET'S GO, KIDDO. THANKS, GENTLEMEN. MY FATHER TAUGHT ME HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. GOOD AND EVIL... ( chuckles ) WERE JUST, YOU KNOW, THINGS THE PRIEST TALKED ABOUT IN MASS. IN THE REAL WORLD, WINNING WAS WHAT MATTERED. I STARTED OUT WITH THE LITTLE THINGS, JUST LIKE YOU... STEALING THAT CAR, HANGING OUT WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE, AND THEN IT SNOWBALLED. YOU KNOW, FAVORS, PAYOFFS. LOTS OF BAD SHIT. GOT OUT OF CONTROL. I NEVER WANTED THAT FOR YOU. I TRIED TO TEACH YOU DIFFERENT, BUT, UH... YOU'RE NOT STUPID. YOU COULD SEE THAT I WOULD SAY ONE THING AND I WOULD DO THE OPPOSITE, SO WHY LISTEN, RIGHT? YEAH. I WAS SO BUSY TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS THAT I FORGOT WHAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. MAYBE I NEVER KNEW, BUT I'M STARTING TO. JOHNNY... I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? FOR WHAT? FOR EVERYTHING. YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. NO, IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT. IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT, BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. I WANT YOU TO BE PROUD OF ME. THANKS. WHAT'S GOING ON, ANGELO? IF IT GETS OUT I'M HERE WITH YOU, I'VE GOT A MAJOR PROBLEM. WE'VE ALL GOT A PROBLEM, FRANCISCO. WHAT PROBLEM? JACK KILLORAN. JACK? WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM? HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING FOR ME, AND NOW HE WANTS OUT. DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE AIRPORT? NO. THEN I'M OUTTA HERE. SIT DOWN. RIGHT NOW, ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH DAVID HAS TO DO WITH THE AIRPORT. SO, JACK WANTS OUT ON THIS ONE THING, OR EVERYTHING? WE DON'T KNOW YET. I REALLY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY OF THIS. THE QUESTION IS HOW BIG IS THE PROBLEM. SAY HE'S ALL DONE, WANTS TO GO FISH SMELTS THE REST OF HIS LIFE. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE AIRPORT? THERE WILL BE NO AIRPORT WITHOUT JACK KILLORAN, PERIOD. HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HANDLE THOSE CLOD-KICKERS DOWN IN SPRINGFIELD. NOT TO MENTION THE FEDERAL END IN WASHINGTON. AND JACK'S THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER. Dede: SHIT. CHARMING IRISH BASTARD. ALWAYS COMING ON TO ME. WE NEVER SHOULD'VE LET HIM GET SO STRONG. YOU GOT IT BACKWARDS, DEDE. HE'S THE ONE WHO LET US GET STRONG. WE ALL OWE HIM. SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? ( chatter ) THREE-TIME MVP, EIGHT-TIME SCORING CHAMP, AND LED THE BULLS TO FIVE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS. MICHAEL JORDAN'S THE GREATEST, HUH, DAD? WELL, HE'S CERTAINLY THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. THIS IS THE GOLDEN AGE OF CHICAGO SPORTS, JOHN. ENJOY IT. IT WON'T ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS. HEY, JACK. GUY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THE KID. ALL RIGHT. BE JUST A MINUTE? MR. KILLORAN. THIS JOINT, HUH? IT'S, LIKE, FUCKING PHARAOH'S TOMB. THE STADIUM! NOW THAT WAS THE REAL THING. YOU COULD SMELL THE HISTORY. REMEMBER ALL THE GAMES YOUR FATHER AND I TOOK YOU TO? '66, THE FIRST YEAR OF THE FRANCHISE. RED KERR, HUH? THE MADHOUSE ON MADISON. WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT CORLISS AND MELENDEZ WANTED TO TEAR IT DOWN, I WAS PISSED. DIDN'T LIKE THAT IDEA, REMEMBER? BUT ONCE I UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE PICTURE, I WENT ALONG. IT WAS PAINFUL TO ME PERSONALLY, BUT I WENT ALONG, AND IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR EVERYBODY. NOW I HARDLY EVER THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. PRETTY SOON, I WON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THE STADIUM LOOKED LIKE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. THAT'S LIFE. ISN'T QUITE THE SAME THING, IS IT, ANGELO? IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME. CONCRETE AND STEEL? THIS IS A HUMAN BEING. I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, HERE, JOHN. I TOLD CORLISS-- YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP HIM WITH THIS THING, FINE. IT'LL BE HARDER, MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. GOOD LUCK. JUST A MINUTE, JOHN. YOU GOT MORE ON YOUR PLATE THAN SOME DEAD GASH. WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF IT? YOU WANT OUT OF THAT, TOO? ( sighs ) I'M SICK OF THE WHOLE THING, ANGELO. WE ALL GET SICK FROM TIME TO TIME. THAT'S WHAT SHRINKS AND WHOREHOUSES ARE FOR. BUT, JOHN, NOW IS NOT THE TIME. MY BOY'S WAITING FOR ME. HOW IS HE? ANGELO. HEY, JOHN. DON'T GET PARANOID. I'M YOUR FRIEND. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT. Woman: HEY, BONNIE. HI. Man: HI. Bonnie: HEY. JOHNNY, GET IN YOUR MOTHER'S CAR. JOHN? WHAT'S HAPPENED? RIGHT. I WANT YOU TO TAKE OFF TO SLIP CARLSON'S PLACE FOR A WHILE. UP IN THE UPPER PENINSULA? WHY? HE'S IN DANGER. MAYBE YOU, TOO. WHY? WHAT'S HAPPENED? ( sighs ) IT'S FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH YOU, HASN'T IT? WHO'S AFTER YOU, THE COPS OR YOUR FRIENDS? MAYBE BOTH. HERE. HURRY. I CAN'T. I HAVE TO GO HOME. I HAVE TO CALL MIKE. I HAVE TO TELL THE SCHOOL. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. DON'T CALL ANYONE. NOT NOW, NOT WHEN YOU GET THERE. DON'T GO OUT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S SAFE. HERE. JOHN! GO. ( glass shatters ) ( chatter ) ( objects clatter ) Joey: I NEVER LIKED THIS FUCKING GUY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PLEASE, DON'T! JOHN. THANK GOD. RELAX. HEY, JOEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY, JACK! JACK, WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS WHAT, JOEY? OH, THAT'S RIGHT, BE AN ASSHOLE. PLEASE! WHAT-- WHAT DO THEY WANT? COME ON! NO! ( grunts ) YOU DON'T TOUCH HER. JACK? JACK? FUCK. IS HE DEAD? I DON'T KNOW. LET ME CHECK FOR A PULSE. EH, HE'S ALIVE. GET UP, YOU FUCKING MOPE. JACK... GIVE THEM WHATEVER THEY WANT. STAY OUT OF THIS, C.J. IT'S THE TAPES, ISN'T IT? I'LL SHOW YOU. THEY'RE DOWNSTAIRS. C.J., DON'T. COME ON. OW! OH! OH! GET UP. IT'S IN THERE. LOOK, BITCH, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT FUCKING TAPES. WHERE'S THE MONEY? UH! THE EVIDENCE? JOHN KEEPS EVERYTHING IN THERE. ALL IN THERE. ( slams ) ( laughing ) ALL RIGHT! WHAT THE FUCK? SHIT. HEY, LOOK. THIS FUCKER'S GOT THE SHIT ON EVERYBODY. JOEY, PUT THE PIECE ON THE FLOOR. ALL RIGHT, JACK, TAKE IT EASY. JACK, DON'T. LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE, JACK. YOU GOT THE MONEY. THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GONNA GET. NOW GET OUT OF MY HOUSE. ( murmurs ) YOU KNOW, KILLORAN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE A SMART GUY, BUT YOU'RE DUMB AS A-- ( screaming ) YOU'RE DEAD. YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD. NOT TONIGHT. OW. GUY OUT WEST WOULDN'T LIKE THAT, JOEY. GUY OUT WEST? OH, CHRIST. NOW, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE. MOVE. GET OUTTA HERE. I'M SORRY, C.J. SORRY THIS HAPPENED. HERE. HERE, SWEETIE. HERE. BABY. YOU OKAY? YOU OKAY? THERE. OH. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU SHOOT ONE OF ANGELO'S BOYS? I TOLD YOU TO GET RID OF THOSE FUCKING TAPES. WHAT IS THAT? ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU CAN'T GO AGAINST THEM. YOU'LL BE FUCKING TRUNK MUSIC! MAYBE YOU BETTER GO, TOO, C.J. WHAT? YOU BETTER GO. YOU'RE THROWING ME OUT? YOU'LL BE SAFER THIS WAY. YOU'RE A FOOL. ANYBODY FOLLOW YOU? I DON'T THINK SO. ( sighs ) JOHN, YOU'VE COME TOO FAR TO TURN BACK NOW. WHAT? YOU'RE SO HOT, YOU DO IT YOURSELF. SORRY. TURNING ON THEM IS LIKE TURNING ON MY OWN FATHER. JACK, THOSE TAPES ARE TOTALLY ILLEGAL. THE BUREAU CAN'T TOUCH THEM. NOW, YOU WANNA WEAR A WIRE... IT'S TOO LATE. I'M BLOWN. THEY FRISK ME EVERY TIME THEY SEE ME. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. HOWARD, WHEN I MET YOU, YOU WERE JUST ANOTHER PINHEAD FROM THE "G" WEARING WHITE SOCKS AND A NARROW TIE, AND I SHOWED YOU HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED IN THIS TOWN. YEAH, YOU'VE DONE ME A FEW FAVORS, JACK, AND I'VE DONE A FEW FOR YOU. NOW, YOU WANT TO FLIP OVER, I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT. I WANT TO HELP, BUT I CAN'T STICK MY NECK OUT ALONE. HOWARD, PLEASE. PLEASE. JACK, DAVID CORLISS PLAYS GOLF WITH THE PRESIDENT TWICE A MONTH. HE RAISED OVER $4 MILLION FOR HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN, $10 MILLION LAST YEAR. YOU REALLY THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS GONNA TURN THE FBI LOOSE ON HIM? Danridge: A ROMAN A CLEF EXPOSE. Jack: YEAH. INCREDIBLE. AWESOME. SO, YOU'LL DO IT, YOU'LL PRINT IT? PULITZER CITY. BUT I DON'T OWN THE NEWSPAPER. PETER NOYCE IS AN AUSTRALIAN BILLIONAIRE. WHAT DOES HE GIVE A SHIT? NOYCE OWNS 51%. YOU KNOW WHO CONTROLS THE OTHER 49. OUR VERY GOOD FRIEND. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING. OH, YEAH. WHEN DID THIS GO DOWN? QUEEN OF THE HERALD HERSELF, DEDE SHARBER. SINCE WHEN? IT JUST HAPPENED. THE ANNOUNCEMENT'S NEXT WEEK. LOOK, JACK, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THIS TOWN IS SEWN UP TIGHTER THAN A BULL'S ASS IN FLY SEASON. NO OFFENSE. Man: ( over loudspeaker ) HEY, MOVE THE CAR. THOSE ARE YOUR PEOPLE, KILLORAN. WHY YOU WANT TO GIVE 'EM UP? BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW RIGHT IF YOU WOKE UP NEXT TO IT. PEOPLE CHANGE, MR. TRAYNOR. SOME PEOPLE. NOT THE KILLORANS. THEY'VE BEEN POISONING THIS CITY FOR 50 YEARS. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDO. I DON'T BUY IT. WHO ARE YOU FRONTING FOR? THE GUY FROM OAK BROOK? THINK YOU CAN PUT ME IN A TRICK BAG? MITCH-- JACK, I'M DUE IN COURT. IN KENYA, WHERE CORRUPTION PERVADES EVERY ASPECT OF GOVERNMENT, WE STILL THINK OF AMERICA AS A SHINING BEACON OF DEMOCRACY, OF JUSTICE. YOU MUST BE THINKING OF IOWA, NOT CHICAGO. DON'T LOSE FAITH, JOHN. IN WHAT? THE KIKUYU PRIEST WHO GAVE THIS TO ME... HAD BEEN A MUNDUMUGU, TRIBAL MEDICINE MAN, WHO CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY. IT HAS SUSTAINED ME THROUGH MANY DARK HOURS WITH THE POWER OF BOTH JESUS AND NGAI. KEEP IT AS LONG AS YOU NEED. ( door closes ) ( creaks ) ( music, chatter ) YOU WANNA CLEAN UP CHICAGO, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE. ( sighs ) ( gun cocks ) ( gun cocks ) ( sparking ) UHH! THAT'S RIGHT, JACK, YOUR INSURANCE POLICY JUST EXPIRED. I WANT YOU TO SEE SOMETHING. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. ( pants ) OH, MY GOD. JOHN? OH! JOHN? JOHN! SON OF A... CHRIST! MONSIGNOR. I'M SORRY, JOHN. FATHER, INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY-- NO! NO! UH! UH! NO! OH, GOD! SEE THAT, YOU MISERABLE FUCK? YOU KILLED YOUR FUCKING PRIEST. YOUR KID'S NEXT. YOU THINK HE'S SAFE IN THE FUCKING WOODS? YOU KNOW WHO TOLD US ABOUT YOUR CABIN IN MICHIGAN? C.J., YOUR CUNT WIFE. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, JACK. DID YOU THINK YOU COULD GO AGAINST US? THE FIXER? YOU'RE WITH US! YOU DOG-ASS PIECE OF SHIT. YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY, UNDERSTAND? DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES. YES. YES. ALL RIGHT. THE VACATION'S OVER. THERE'S BUSINESS TO TAKE CARE OF. FIRST THE AIRPORT, THEN THIS. GET IT DONE. NOW, GET THE FUCK DOWN TO SPRINGFIELD. Radio: IT'S 78 DEGREES IN SPRINGFIELD, 76 IN DECATUR... Bubba: YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, WHY? WE, UH, WE HEARD YOU WASN'T FEELING TOO WELL. I HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT, BUT I'M BACK IN TOP FORM. AH. WELL, SIT DOWN, AND HAVE YOURSELF A MESS OF CORN FRITTERS. OH, THAT'S NOT FOR ME. LOOK AT THAT. ( chuckles ) ( clears throat ) NOW, UH, TO SHAKE OFF THE CHAFF. THIS AIRPORT MAY BE THE HANGING GARDEN OF BABYLON TO THAT PUERTO RICAN MAYOR OF YOURS, BUT, JACK, IT DON'T MEAN DOODLEY-DINK DOWN HERE. MEXICAN. THE MAYOR'S A MEXICAN. ( chuckles ) HE'S NOT A PUERTO RICAN. THERE'S ONLY ONE BROWN IN MY BOX OF CRAYOLAS, SON. ( clears throat ) NOW. EARL HERE, AFTER A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER IN THE LEGISLATURE, WOULD LIKE TO CAP HIS LIFE OF PUBLIC SERVICE BY SERVING ON THE STATE SUPREME COURT. I'LL SPEAK TO THE GOVERNOR. ( chuckles ) AS FOR MYSELF, A LITTLE GRAIN IN THE ELEVATOR. ( unzips ) THIS SHOULD, UH, HELP YOU GET THROUGH THE WINTER. JACK, THIS TIME TOMORROW, YOU'LL HAVE YOUR AIRPORT. GENTLEMEN. AIN'T YOU GONNA EAT? LOVE TO, BUT I'M ON THE MOVE. BUBBA. ATTABOY, JACK. YOUR HONOR. AH! ( laughing ) ( rings ) HELLO. LANDRY AND POWELL ARE TAKEN CARE OF. WHEN'S THE VOTE? TOMORROW. THAT'S GREAT. JACK, THAT'S GREAT. I KNEW IT. KNEW WHAT? CORLISS, THE GUY OUT WEST, THEY SAID YOU WANTED OUT. I TOLD THEM, "BULLSHIT." YEAH, BULLSHIT. I KNEW YOU WERE A STAND-UP GUY, JACK. IT, UH, WASN'T CHEAP, MR. MAYOR. LANDRY GOES TO THE SUPREME COURT. I GAVE, UH, POWELL 100,000. MONOPOLY MONEY, JACK. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. ADIOS. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE. WHY AM I HERE? BECAUSE I REACHED OUT FOR YOU. JACK WANTS A MEET. WHAT FOR? WORK ON OUR PROBLEM. WHAT PROBLEM? TYRELL HOLMES DIED. SHIT. BEFORE OR AFTER HE CONFESSED? IF IT WAS AFTER, WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS MEETING. WHO IS TYRELL HOLMES? THE MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY HE STRANGLED BRENDA. YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS KIND OF SHIT IN FRONT OF ME. ANGELO. OKAY, FRANCISCO. BUT NEXT TIME I CALL, YOU COME. NOBODY ELSE LEAVES THE JOINT TILL WE WORK THIS THING OUT. WHAT'S TO WORK OUT? SO IT'S ANOTHER UNSOLVED MURDER. BIG DEAL. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT TO PLAY IT. THE THING'S TOO HOT. THE TALK'S ALL OVER THE STREET. WE CAN'T LEAVE IT HANGING. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND, JACK? PIN IT ON JOEY. THE FUCK? YOU MOTHERFUCKER! ( laughing ) TAKE IT EASY, KID. THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK, JACK. HEAR ME OUT. WE RUN A GAME FROM THE JUMP. OUR COPPERS MAKE THE PINCH, DO THE QUESTIONS. OUR GUYS AT THE STATE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE PROSECUTE. JUDGE WOLINKSKI HEARS THE CASE. LAY IT DOWN. JOEY GETS PINCHED DUI. THEY SEARCH HIM. THEY FIND BRENDA WEBBER'S WALLET. HE CONFESSES. PLEAS GUILTY, DIMINISHED CAPACITY-- HE WAS DRUNK, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING. IT'S A WEAK CASE. THEY PLEAD IT OUT. HE GETS, TOPS, SEVEN TO 15 FOR MANSLAUGHTER. ALL I DID IS KNOCK IT DOWN AND CLOSE IT OUT AS A PIECE OF SHIT HOMICIDE, BUT WE GOTTA MOVE FAST. OH, THIS IS BULLSHIT! JOEY, YOU'LL BE ON THE STREET IN 40 MONTHS. WHERE'S MINE? ANGELO? HOW'S TEN LARGE SOUND? LIKE SHIT. TEN GRAND FOR EVERY MONTH SERVED. THAT'S 400,000. GIVE ME THE FUCKING WALLET. WAIT. THERE'S A LIST OF NAMES IN THE BACK OF THE ADDRESS BOOK. RIP IT OUT. ANOTHER GREAT STORY THAT WON'T MAKE THE NEWS. DEDE, I'D CONSIDER IT A PERSONAL FAVOR IF YOU'D SPLIT JOEY'S FEE WITH DAVID. MY, UH, DRIVERS ARE TALKING ABOUT STRIKING FOR A NEW CONTRACT. THEY WON'T. GENTLEMEN. SHIT, THE VOTE'S GOING DOWN IN SPRINGFIELD RIGHT NOW. BRILLIANTLY DONE, JACK. IRON JOHN WOULD'VE BEEN REAL PROUD. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THAT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY. HAPPINESS IS GREATLY OVERRATED. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, WE ALL GOTTA DO THINGS THAT MAKE US UNHAPPY. WE CAN'T RISK YOU HAVING ANOTHER ATTACK OF CONSCIENCE. HOW'S IT GONNA HAPPEN? CAR WRECK. ( revving ) YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN WEARING YOUR COLLAR. THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN. ( grunts ) LOTS OF FUN. ( tin can rattles ) ( cocks ) ( laughing ) COME ON, LET'S GO. GO ON. UH! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! RELEASE MR. KILLORAN AND PLACE YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEADS! NOW! RELEASE MR. KILLORAN AND PLACE YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEADS! ( shouting, sirens ) CUTTING IT PRETTY CLOSE, MITCH. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE GOT THE ACTUAL MURDER ATTEMPT ON TAPE. ANY LATER, WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED A TAPE. YOU WOULD'VE HAD THE BODY! HOWARD, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO STICK YOUR NECK OUT. ALONE, JACK. I SAID ALONE. ONCE YOU CONVINCED MITCH, I WAS IN. HOW'S THE LEG? I'LL BE FINE. WHAT ABOUT MY FAMILY? BONNIE AND JOHNNY ARE IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY. THEY'LL GO UNDER WITNESS PROTECTION. AND C.J.? I DON'T KNOW. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER YET. SHE MAY'VE SKIPPED. OH, CHRIST. YEAH, SHE DRAINED YOUR JOINT ACCOUNTS. HOW'D EVERYTHING ELSE GO? GOOD. FBI. SON OF A BITCH! HEY! HEY, HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? GOT A WARRANT FOR THIS? THERE YOU GO. TURN AROUND. OUR BAGGAGE-HANDLING SOFTWARE IS ALREADY BEING WRITTEN. COME WITH US, MR. MAYOR. Dede: I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'VE REACHED AN AGREEMENT. YEAH, UNION RULES! ALL RIGHT! MS. SHARBER, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. CAN YOU COME WITH US, PLEASE? LET'S GO, YOUR HONOR. HOLD IT, MR. CORLISS. SHIT, THERE HE GOES! ( shouting ) FBI! ( shouting ) HEY, WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING WARRANT? RIGHT HERE. ALL RIGHT! TAKE IT EASY. YOU'RE GONNA DO TIME, JACK. NOT AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS, BUT GONNA HAVE TO GO DOWN. YEAH, I KNOW. WE'LL TAKE MY CAR. MR. KILLORAN, BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION YOU HAVE, UH, DONE LITTLE ELSE THAN LIE, CHEAT, STEAL, AND, UH, SPREAD CORRUPTION ALL OF YOUR ADULT LIFE, HUH? THAT'S CORRECT. IN FACT, YOU'VE BEEN SENTENCED TO PRISON, HAVEN'T YOU? YES, SIX YEARS, FOR THE AIRPORT FIX. YET YOU EXPECT THIS JURY TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE SOMEHOW BEEN MAGICALLY TRANSFORMED INTO AN ORACLE OF TRUTH, A PARAGON OF HOLY VIRTUE. WHEN YOUR BEST FRIENDS MURDER A PRIEST IN COLD BLOOD RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, IT PUTS YOU THROUGH A FEW CHANGES, SIR. HOW'S IT FEEL, JACK, TO RUIN SO MANY LIVES? ANY REGRETS, JACK? WHAT WOULD YOUR FATHER SAY? OKAY. YOU TAKE CARE OF JOHNNY. I WILL. AND YOU... TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOTHER, ALL RIGHT? YEAH. OKAY, HERE. ( tinkling ) THIS'LL HELP YOU. THANKS. DAD. I AM PROUD OF YOU. THAT WAS ALL WORTH IT. LET'S GO.
