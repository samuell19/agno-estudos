I don't even want to think about it. I'd rather be bad than disappointing. [playing harmonica] Are you still thinking about it? Yeah. My mom worked really hard to get us here. I just wrecked it for her. She seems like a really nice lady. Yeah, she's pretty terrific. The last three years since they got their divorce, she's been everything. A mom, a dad, a friend-- a lot of gratitude I showed her. My father has such aspirations for me. He's so proud of where we came from. He's determined that I'll never forget my heritage. Well, we had to try and do what we did, right? We didn't do much. Yeah, well, I mean, we tried. Mom always said if you're gonna do something, try your best. And go for it. Well, we went for it. Look where it got us. I guess I'm sorry for a lot of the trouble I caused you. Well, most of my anger at you is because Ellie took to you so quickly. Well, um, to be honest, I kinda cheated with Ellie. What do you mean? When you weren't looking, I slipped her some candy so that she'd take the bottle. Very smart. Yeah, well, I'm afraid it's the last smart thing I did since I came to Kenya. [Ellie rumbling] [chain clanks] Oh, no. ♪♪ What are we gonna do now? They'll give her more drugs-- or worse. We've got to get her out of here. What about our parents? Our parents are going to get mad at us anyway. There's not much we can do about that. We still have a shot at helping Ellie though.

Why don't I just shoot that elephant? Juba is a wonderful skinner. Yeah, she'd make mighty fine boots and belts but my wife, she'd be real disappointed. Let me show you a picture of her. That's your wife? Yeah, that's my Marylou. Elephants ain't the only thing money can buy, boys. Let's go. Maybe I should just shoot the lot of them. Ah, don't go shooting those boys. No way I can make boots out of 'em. Maybe I should shoot you and stuff you on my wall next to my rhino and my buffalo. Then you wouldn't get the rest of your money, would you? I could always remove it from your reeking carcass. That's real funny but I think you'd be outnumbered. By whom? [laughs] By me, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Wesson. Oh, that Mr. Smith and Wesson. You wouldn't use that. I am from Florida, you know. Now, why don't you two boys go unhitch that trailer and get on inside? Get to know each other better. You make a real cute couple.
