Look at the current temperature. Would you look at it? At this hour, after 11:00, tt is 52 mild degrees. But when we take a look at future cast here, Here's part of the changes that we're watching here, and that is, as we head toward early tomorrow morning, we will see clouds, and even fog, settle in. The good news, though, is that they will quickly burn off as we go through the rest of the day, and we are looking at a day that will be pretty much what We saw.. like what we saw today: Partly cloudy and very mild. So get ready for another good day. As far as lows go tonight, again, it is not going to be like the lows that we've seen over the past few weeks. It's going to be very mild tonight for everybody, from top to bottom, no matter where you are. Ellijay, 43. Griffin, 44. 43, that's the low for the folks in Rome and Atlanta. You're looking at lows.. Lows for tonight that'll be around 46 degrees. Tomorrow's highs: Here we go again. More warmth on the way. Can you stand it? 65 degrees. I'm sure you can. I can. Atlanta, 67 will be the high for you tomorrow. As we take a look at Athens, 66. Eatonton, up and over 71 degrees tomorrow. So here's a look at your forecast by the numbers. On a scale from one to ten.. Oh, yes, we did. We're doing it. We're going there. We are giving tomorrow a ten. Why? It is going to be so much warmer than the average. Average high, by the way, in the upper 50s, and we're looking at temperatures that will be in the upper 60s, and we are not stopping there, because we do have some 70s in the forecast for you. Yes, we do. Here's a look at the seven-day forecast. 67 degrees, mainly sunny tomorrow after the clouds and fog burn off in the morning, then as we head toward Friday, calling it partly cloudy and 72. Saturday and Sunday, partly cloudy. Look at those numbers, though. Still holding on to the low 70s there. Monday and Tuesday, possibly a weak disturbance coming our way. There may be a slight chance for rain, but temperatures still will be above average. So Saturday and Sunday.. even when you step outside tonight.. You feel it; it's mild. It doesn't feel like February at all, does it? But as we head toward the next couple of days, will that change? We'll find out coming up, but let's talk about this outside right now. Our exclusive Weatherbug Network for Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta, current temperature at this hour, just under 60 degrees. The high today, 72. It feels great, y'all. Here's a look at their surface map, showing us what's gonna come our way as we head toward tomorrow, and really, it's more warm air from the southeast, and that'll be the story for us. We will not only stay dry with the warm wind. We will keep it party cloudy and beautiful as well. So look for your Friday to be another gorgeous day. What a better way to get into the weekend? As far as highs are concerned, look at these numbers. 73 in Gainesville. 75 for the folks in Athens. In Atlanta, 75. 75 is what we're forecasting For the ATL as well. Up in Rome, we're looking at 71, And 75 for the folks in Carlton. So if we make that forecasted high of 75 degrees tomorrow, We will at least.. At the very least.. Tie the record high that has already been set for 75 degrees. So we'll keep you posted and let you know if we do that. Forecast by the numbers, on a scale from one to ten... Nah, quit playing.

Well, Man, you know, we trying to help the church and make sure everybody's filled with the spirit of god. Trying to make a way for these children, Man, to help the young folk, Man, with God's spirit. And that's what I was feeling up there. The great thing about it was, when I saw you up there talking, it just really took me back to the time when we was coming up, and I didn't know then, but I see it now, what you did for me and the kids in the area, and that's what's really important.

You know, Joey, I'll tell you, Man, Sit down for a minute, Man? Yeah, Man. This is my nephew I've been telling you about, Man. Yeah. Yeah, come on have a seat, Man. We're all family here, Man. Okay, cool, cool. Service was good. We all right. Yeah, but listen, Xavier. This is Joey, Man.. Joey Davis. Been going to church here since he was a kid, Man. Listen, he's a good friend of mine, you know? How is the music business? I mean, like, really, how is it? The music business.. Uh, it's ugly, But, you know, it's fair, I guess. Mm-hmm. Well, the reason why I'm bringing this up.. And no disrespect to you, Mr. Willy Pastor.. Is, I have an artist that I've been working with for a while, and maybe the next time you're in town, maybe we can get together and we can.. You know, you can work with her. Okay, I didn't know you was into music. Probably one of his mistress, Man. Yeah, you know, I don't care about all that. You know, I'm not really into music. You can really say I'm into.. I'm into many things. But I'm really here to help the world, if you need me. Oh, okay. Well, you know, they say he's one of the most feared man in Atlanta, so you can look at how he's dressed, and I don't believe it. Oh, come on, Willy. This is how he dresses, Man. Well, you know, the streets is just smoke and mirrors, know what I'm saying? But what I would like, Zay, is that you take my card and stay in touch with me, and the next time you're in town, Zay, and if there's anything that you need.. Anything.. You make sure to look me up and call me on that number, all right? 'Cause I make magic happen. That's what I do. Okay. Okay? And may God bless you guys. All right, Man. Take care of yourself. Hey, Joey, any time, Man. Take care of yourself. Hey, tell the wife I said hello. I sure will, Man. okay, cool. Take care, Young Man. All right, Man. All right. So what's going on, huh? Hey, what's going on, Zay? What's you up to, Man? What's you up to, Man? Oh, ain't nothing to it, Man. How you doing? You looking good. I ain't seen you in a while. Been a minute since I've seen you, Man. You doing all right? Yeah, I'm doing pretty good. How's life treating you, Man? You know, it's got its ups and downs. Can't complain. I'm here. Okay, well, listen, Man. Just to let you know, Man, that young man right there, Man, Joey, just donated about 50 grand to the church, Man. $50,000? Yeah, $50,000. What'd he do? That's gonna help me pay off this building, Man. $50,000. What he do? Oh, you know, Man, don't worry about what he do, Man. Just, you know, thank God for him and you keep him in prayer, Man, 'Cause, you know, I ain't no.. I'm not gonna judge him, Man. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. But he's a good person, Man. Okay. But let me ask you a question, Man. I haven't seen you in a while in the church. How you been doing, Man? How's everything going? Are you happy? No, not really, you know. Man, this music business ain't what I thought it was gonna be. Man, me and my cousin just fell out. Who, you and Nuke? Man, that Batman and Robin there, Bro. All right, listen. Nuke got me in a bind with some guy, and I just found out that he's the reason for my success, and I didn't even want the guy's help. Well, let me give you some advice, Xavier. You know, one thing about it, Man, God send people in your life for a reason, and a lot of times, we don't understand, but just know that God's working on your behalf, to help you with your success. So let it soak in. Don't get too emotional. Just ride that wave, Man. Ride that wave, Man. Yeah, Man, but it just seem like everybody around, they want something from you. It's like, the bigger you get, the more alone you feel. You know what? And that's true, Because most black successful people have to isolate themself. You know why? Because the people that they around are always in need, always in need. But you got to remember that we can't save the world. You and I can't save the world. We can only change the outlook on the world. You know, so how we do that? Well, Zay, it's just like, in time, you're gonna figure that out. But just know this: That money and success, with no love, has no real value. I want you to understand that. And to let you know too, Man, that I really, really love you. I love you too. All right, thanks. Thanks for your help, Man. No problem, Man. All right. All right. I'll see you. Goddamn mother fucker. I didn't take a fucking thing! Goddamn it. I didn't take a fucking thing from you! I helped you with fucking billions. I didn't take a fucking thing, not a fucking dime, You fucking asshole! No! Oh! I didn't do a fucking thing wrong! Oh! What's up, Man? What's up, Man? Doc will be out in a minute. All right, Bro. Appreciate it. Oh! I didn't do anything. What's that? You got that business with you? Yeah, for sure. Black duty called, Man. I told you, Doc. I got it, Man. That's the contract right there. Zay signed, sealed, delivered. You know what, Nuke? I was just telling about y'all niggas the other day. Whatever happened to niggas doing real business? You know what I'm saying? I got this motherfucker cracker bitch. I knew you for ten fucking years! I haven't fucking taken any money that wasn't mine. Oh! Yeah, works with me for ten years, Man. A banker playing with money, Man. Look at that bitch. I might let him kill this fucker. I didn't do anything. I know I still owe you $5,000. I'm gonna get you that other 5, Man. Just give me the time to get on the road, and I got you. That's my word. You know, I want some real shit. I ain't tripping on no money, home. I don't even care nothing about no $5,000, Man. As long as we be in the straight. We straight. That's straight. You know what I mean?

I don't want you to worry about that thing. Look at me. I don't want you to worry about the thing. Carl, tell him. You did the streets a great favor.

I want to thank you for everything you've done for me, from the bottom of my heart. It means a lot to me. So if there's anything that I can do for you, Let me know. And I appreciate that, but money-wise, you can do nothing for me. He speaks the truth. Doc had over $5 million stashed away in a bank account in the Cayman Islands. Managed exclusively by his banker, Me. And what's so great about it.. This is how the street works.. 1/3 of that is going back to me. You know that I'm a hustler, okay? Well... It's the way of the world. Trust us. Well, what about the other 25? The other 25.. I'm gonna handle that. That's the money I'm going to use to really trick off in Vegas. Zay, why don't you join us there? Ah, no, Man. I can't. Nah, I can't do it, Man. I got some other stuff I got to handle. Well, we would love to have you. So other than that, go get your life together, Man, and when you see me around, let's just have.. You know, get together and have a drink, all right? All right, Man. Wish you the best. Thank you. Thank you. You know, he's coming through. Let's make sure of that. Good day, Sir. Thank you. Cuz, who you going up there to meet, Man? Man, look, don't worry about that. Here. What's this? That's your split For the covert and covert management deal and the Ultra money. That mean I'm still your manager, right? No. But you could be my road manager, Man, if you slowed down. You know something, Zay? You never told me how Doc got killed, Man. You have something to do with this nigger getting killed, Zay? It's understood. Don't got to be explained. You a cold motherfucker, Zay. Hey, we Birds Of A Feather, right? 1,000.
