You know, we re the only species on earth that can modify our form? I find that beautiful. Yes. But this girl looks weird. But she doesn t think so. Some people think the road to changing themselves is this, It s a hair cut, a dress. A pair of lime green trousers. They don t see the full spectrum. I mean, to decorate, to experiment. It's the same urge. And some of us realize that there s no end to this. [UPLIFTING MUSIC] [EXHALING SOUNDS] [CREAKING SOUND] [UPLIFTING MUSIC FADES OUT] I brought you some more. Thank you. It s one of my favorites. Are you going to pierce me? When you do it, I don t want you to drug me. I want to see it. I want to see you do it. Are you sure? I m not afraid of pain. There s no such thing as pain. Just intense physical sensation. Remember that. But if I don t feel anything then it s like, there s no point. You re right. You can trust me. Good. Get some sleep. [CLICKING SOUND] [DRONING SOUND] Shh, shhh, shhh. It s ok. It s ok. This is my gift to you. Are you ready? And remember there is no such thing as pain. Ok. Now, breathe in. And breathe out.
