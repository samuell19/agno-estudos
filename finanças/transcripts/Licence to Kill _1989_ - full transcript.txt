We have a mid-course deviation. Target heading 036, 126 miles? bearing 062, Havana VOR. He?s landing at Cray Cay. - Advise Key West Drug Enforcement. - Roger, sir. A WACS to Key West. Key West Drug Enforcement, please come in. If they hurry, they just might be able to grab the bastard. Now, you?re sure you?ve got the ring? Relax, Felix. Friends of yours? My partners at the DEA. What the hell is going on? - Sanchez is in the Bahamas. - Have you cleared it with Nassau? - We?ve got the green light. - Let?s go! Hey, Felix! Haven?t you forgotten something? Oh, James, explain to Della, will you? No way. I?m coming with you. Okay, but strictly as an observer. - Sorry, Sharky. - Hey, why me? Hey, you guys! You can?t do this to me! What will I tell Della? What did he promise you? His heart? Give her his heart. No. No, Franz. I didn?t mean any harm. It?s all right, baby. We all make mistakes. Your escapades are getting more creative. Not a word. He?s still not here. Can you go around the block again? - What about the guests? - I told you this was a mistake! James. Just in case. I want Sanchez alive! Stay here, James. - No Sanchez. - Damn! Watch out! Hey, observer! You trying to get yourself killed? If I don?t get you back for the wedding, I?m a dead man for sure. - Do you need help? - No. Take your hands off me. Just go away. - Sanchez! - Let?s go! Come on! Come on! He?ll be in Cuban airspace in 20 minutes. He hasn?t got away yet! - What the hell are you doing? - Let?s go fishing! Forward. Forward. Easy. Hold it. Back up. Forward now. Hold it! Bring him in! Take the load! - No. Please go home. I?m very-- - They?re here! Let?s go, James! - Come along. - James! - Your hat. - Thank you. On the double! Move away from the door! You?re facing 139 felony counts, Sanchez. Why, that?s 936 years. Even one of your famous million-dollar bribes can?t get you out of this one. Two. What? Two million, U.S. A standing offer for anyone who springs me. Goddamn it! Do you think you?re in some banana republic? All that scumbag money won?t do you a bit of good here. Very good. But I think I?m gonna be home soon. Why, you-- Get ahold of yourself! We got a nice private cell waiting for your ass at Quantico? and I?m gonna personally see you get there. I?m terribly sorry. That?s a custom. The bride always gets to kiss her best man. I thought it was the other way around. Oh, James, would you mind? Felix is still in the study. We?ve got to cut this cake. I?ll do anything for a woman with a knife. Thank you. Could you help me? - Sorry. - No, no. We?re finished. - Pam, meet James. - Good-bye, Felix. Strictly business, my friend. Switch that thing off, Felix. You know you have a house full of guests. Just let me save this. Take a seat. The department wants a full report, yesterday. We really hit it lucky today. Sanchez hasn?t been out of his home base for years. - Couldn?t you extradite him? - Not a chance. He?s killed, intimidated or bribed half the officials from here to Chile. There?s only one law down there. Sanchez? law. Lead or silver. Ed! Double congratulations, old buddy. You take your time on the honeymoon. Everything?s okay. You must be Bond, the guy who came along for the ride. Ed Killifer. We?re taking Sanchez to Quantico this afternoon. - Hey, stay and have a drink with us. - Can?t. Gotta get back. I just came by to kiss the bride. Felix, time to cut the cake. Hand me the picture of Della, quick. She must be ready to kill me. - I tied them myself. - What are these? - Lures. - They?ll keep you busy for a few days. You?re not going fishing on my honeymoon! Thanks. How many others are being held in there? - Where are you taking him? - Why did you go to the Bahamas? - Where are you taking him? - Mr. Sanchez, will you look this way? Come on, get him inside. What is your real nationality, Se?or Sanchez? Are you really Colombian? - Have you been fairly treated? - One more picture, please! Are you connected with any laboratories in South America? - Why did you go to the Bahamas? - No more questions. Do you expect to be vindicated, Mr. Sanchez? Wait a minute. - Okay, let?s go. - We?re moving out. Excuse me, Liala. Just a minute. - I have a surprise for you. - Really? Oh! It?s right over here. What?s that? ?James. Love always, Della and Felix.? We love you. Thanks. Come on! - What the hell?s happened? - Chopper, do you hear me? - I want you to come down. - How deep is it there? Call up an amphibian. We have an accident. Code red-- - Congratulations. - Thanks. Oh, James, I wanted you to have something. You know the tradition. The next one who catches this is the next one who-- Thanks, Della. It?s time I left. Oh, James. Did I say something wrong? He was married once, but it was a long time ago. Felix, you?re no good to me with a wrecked back. Let her go. I?m the one you want. Ready to go? We got the batteries recharged on the sub. It?ll take you the 12-mile limit. A fast boat to Cuba. - You?ll be there for breakfast. - Relax. We?ll wait for Dario. Look, are you crazy? You got everybody looking for you. What about Killifer? Having a cop here is nuts. I want to deep-six him. I made a deal with this guy, and I?m gonna keep my word. I don?t like it. He can finger me. I spent a fortune on this cover. Something you better understand, amigo. Loyalty is more important to me than money. Now get the cop. Here?s two million, all in twenties. It?s very heavy, but difficult to trace. Smart. Now, be ready for tomorrow. I?ll have someone pick you up. - Where?s Lupe? - On the boat. Keep her there until I send for her. Hey, no fooling around with my girl. You kidding? After what you did to that guy on the islands? You liked my little valentine, huh? Where?s my wife? Don?t worry. We gave her a nice honeymoon. I want you to know this is nothing personal. It?s purely business. - Killifer! - Sorry, old buddy. But two mill is a hell of a chunk of dough. Killing me won?t stop anything, Sanchez! There are worse things than dying. See you in hell! No. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you. Your passport, please. - What?s going on? - Some big drug dealer just escaped. Will that be smoking or non-smoking-- Your ticket! Felix, you?ll be all right. Hang on. Hey, Leiter, where you been? It?s Bond. Get an ambulance here, quick. Hi, Sharky. You stick around. I might have some more questions for you, okay? How is he? His left leg?s gone below the knee. They might be able to save his arm. You can bet it was a chain saw. Colombians love to use ?em on informers. They sell more here than in the state of Oregon. I wish I could be more hopeful, but we?ll have to wait and see. Chain saw, my ass! I know a shark bite when I see one. Sanchez has vanished. He?s got Leiter?s files. God only knows what?s in them. - Well, find him! - He?s out of our jurisdiction. There?s plenty of countries that?ll protect him. - We can?t even get an extradition. - There are other ways. Let it go, Commander. You?re just gonna forget all about it? No, I?m not gonna forget about it. Looks like Sanchez? law operates north of the border too. Let?s go shark hunting. This is the last place in the Keys. We?ll have to try Miami next. Stay here. You stay out of sight. I?ll handle this. We?re closed. Ain?t nobody here. Look, I?ve come all the way from London to see you. Universal Exports. We?ve been retained by the Regent?s Park Zoo? to arrange shipment of a charcharadon carcharias. - A what? - Great white shark. It?s all right, Bill. Let him in. Unfortunately, we sold all our sharks years ago. As you can see, we do purely research now. It?s a project to feed the third world. We feed maggot to our special breed of genetically engineered fish. Use hormones to make them all male. Gain weight faster. From your shark hunting days? Yeah. Actually, it?s for sale. Look, I?m kind of busy. Maybe some other time. Thank you. I look forward to seeing you again. - Good-bye, Mr.-- - Good-bye. Mr. Krest said to be ready. He?ll send the sub back in three hours to pick you up. Can?t wait. This dump gives me the creeps. Hold it right there! Do you mind if I get my hands out of here? Yeah. Do it slowly. Bon appetit! Freeze! Over by the trap door, old buddy. Is this where you put your old buddy Felix? Not me. Chalk that one up to Sanchez and Krest. There?s $2 million in that suitcase. I?ll split it with you. You earned it. You keep it, old buddy. God, what a terrible waste. Of money. Hey, Sharky! - Any news on the Wavekrest? - She?s a big marine research vessel? owned by a Milton Krest. They?re collecting specimens off the Cay Sel Bank. How long will it take us to get there? Maybe about six hours. I have a few things to pick up. Be ready in an hour. Yeah, okay. Hey, Commander, you got a minute? The local cops got a tip about a warehouse last night. Turned up 500 keys of Colombian pure? a couple of stiffs? and a little bitty piece of what used to be Killifer. Good. At least someone?s on the case. You may be a pal of Leiter?s, but I can only cover up so much. The D.A. is screaming to know what happened. You know, we got laws in this country too. Do you have a law against what they did to Leiter? Look, you?re in over your head. This is where it ends, Commander. You were supposed to be In Istanbul last night. I?m afraid this unfortunate Leiter business has clouded your judgment. You have a job to do. I expect you on a plane this afternoon. - I haven?t finished here, sir. - Leave it to the Americans. It?s their mess. Let them clear it up. Sir, they?re not going to do anything. I owe it to Leiter. He?s put his life on the line for me many times. Oh, spare me this sentimental rubbish! He knew the risks. - And his wife? - This private vendetta of yours? could easily compromise Her Majesty?s government. You have an assignment, and I expect you to carry it out? objectively and professionally. Then you have my resignation, sir. We?re not a country club, 007. Effective immediately, your license to kill is revoked? and I require you to hand over your weapon? now. I need hardly remind you that you are still bound by the Official Secrets Act. Then I guess it?s? a farewell to arms. Don?t shoot! Too many people! God help you, Commander. Something in Sector ?C.? You caused us all a lot of trouble, young lady. You?re borracho. Go to bed. When Sanchez heard you ran away, he went nuts. It?s none of your business. It?s my business when your stupid little tricks get Sanchez arrested? and I?ve gotta put my organization at risk to get him out. The DEA just raided Key West. You cost me a lot of dough. He?ll give you the money. He doesn?t work that way. You better watch yourself, girlie. I?ve known him a long time. I?ve seen a lot of girls like you come and go. You?re drunk. Get out! And stop peeking through my windows. Come on. What are you so stuck up for? He fixed that phony beauty contest you won. - Mr. Krest? - Yeah, what? The Sentinel?s picking up something large on the monitor, sir. I think you?d better take a look. I don?t believe this. What the hell is it now? It?s just a manta ray. Get the probe back in. - We?ll start loading now. - Yes, sir. He said, ?You?re okay.? Take care of him. Make a sound, and you?re dead. - You-- - What are you doing in here? Krest gave me his cabin. He?s next door. - Where?s Sanchez? - He?s not on board. - I don?t know where he is. - You?re his girlfriend. He doesn?t tell me anything. Open up. I need to talk to you. Answer it. Just a moment. - What do you want? - Somebody slipped aboard. Did you see anybody? No, I was sleeping. Go away. Mr. Krest, they?re back. Bolt your door. Who whipped you? Sanchez? It was my fault. I did something wrong, made him angry. - Nice work, Clive. - Thanks, Mr. Krest. Guess what? His name was Sharky. Get rid of the boat. We got work to do. You?d better find yourself a new lover. Don?t you men know any other way? It?s Sanchez? way. You seem to like it. You know nothing. Please go. If they find you here, we?ll both be killed. Stay here. We?ve got everything useful out of her. That?s it. - Take her out and sink her. - Okay, Clive. Cast off! Compliments of Sharky. Man overboard! Get him! Don?t let him get away! - What?s wrong? - Get back in your cabin and stay there! Guy must?ve drowned, Mr. Krest. Don?t be so sure. Find him! Come on, move it! - Launch Sentinel. - Yes, sir. Stand by to dive when I tell you. Numbers one and two, dive! I can see something reflecting over there. Too much turbulence to be sure. Loading completed, Mr. Krest. - Bring Sentinel back in. - Yes, sir. Bring Sentinel up! There he is! Right there! Get him! There! Dive, damn it! Dive! Right there! Dive! There! Pick him up! - All boats return to Wavekrest. - Aye, aye, sir. Here. Put her stern in. Hey, do you know someone called Bouvier? Over there. This is an unexpected pleasure. - Where?s Leiter? - Hospital. Intensive care. Where you?ll be if you don?t get out of here fast. Sanchez has Leiter?s files. Your name is all over them. Hell! I knew something was wrong. Those two have been at the bar for hours. Probably waiting to see who showed up to meet me. - Would you like anything to drink? - Bud with a lime. - Yeah, same. - Sure thing, hon. Shit! It?s Dario. He?s bad news. He used to be with the contras before they kicked him out. Just the kind of guy Sanchez would send. You carrying? If they start shooting, you just hit the deck and stay there. Don?t I know you from somewhere? Oh, yes, I do. You used to fly charter planes? for some friends of mine. I got a job for you. Why don?t we go outside and talk in private? Take your hands off her! She?s with me. Nobody?s asking you, gringo. He?s with me! Keep your hands on the table. Here we go. Two beers. That?ll be $3.50. Do your friends want something? Let me get it. He?s had enough. Run a tab. - Okay. - How did you get here? - By boat. - Where is it? Back behind this wall. Thanks. Touch?. Get it started. Come on! - Don?t move. - Relax. It?s a bulletproof vest. This Kevlar is great. You?re bloody lucky to be alive! It?s not luck. It?s experience. - A bit higher would?ve been your head. - Look, I just saved your life! If it wasn?t for me, your ass would?ve been nailed to the wall! - You saved my life? - Yes! It?s a tough business you?ve picked. Leave it to the professionals. Look, pal, I was an army pilot! I have flown to the toughest hellholes in South America? and I will not have you lecture me about professionalism! Out of gas. I haven?t heard that one in a long time. They must have hit the fuel line. I?m gonna need your help. I want a complete rundown on Sanchez? operation. And I?ll need a flight to Isthmus City. Private. - No one must know I?ve left. - What do you want to go there for? I?ll pay you very well. You?re going after Sanchez, aren?t you? - Will you help me? - How many men have you got? Just you and me. Are you crazy? Sanchez has an entire army protecting him down there. Just fly me in and leave. Fifty thousand. It?s not that easy. False flight plans, payoffs at Isthmus City Airport-- I can?t do a job like that for less than a hundred. Sixty. - Ninety. - Seventy. - Eighty - Seventy-five. You pay the fuel? You get the plane. Deal. Why don?t you wait until you?re asked? Well, why don?t you ask me? There are five typing errors on the first page alone. - What?s got into you? - Sorry, sir. ?U.S. Immigration has no reports of 007? leaving the United States as of 1500 hours today.? - Who authorized this? - I did, sir. I thought you?d be worried about James. He?s gone missing. You know him better than that. He?ll go after Sanchez. He?s got to be stopped. I?ve already alerted our man in Isthmus. I want that out by this afternoon. Yes, sir. ?Q? Branch, please. This is the master bedroom. I hope everything is satisfactory, se?or. It?s adequate. I?d like a case of champagne. Bollinger R.D. Certainly, se?or. If I could ask you to sign the registration cards-- No, my executive secretary, Miss Kennedy, will take care of that. Right here, please. Fresh flowers every day. Thank you very much. Your key. Enjoy your stay. It?s Ms. Kennedy. And why can?t you be my executive secretary? We?re south of the border. It?s a man?s world. Thanks for everything. Your job?s finished. - I want to stay. - Too dangerous. - Enough people have been killed already. - Don?t talk to me about danger. I won?t be safe until Sanchez is dead. Besides, you could use my help. Well, if you?re gonna be my executive secretary, you?d better look the part. Here. Buy yourself some decent clothes. What bank does Sanchez use? I need to make a deposit. The biggest one in town. Banco de Isthmus. He owns it. I?ve come to make a small deposit. I?m sure my people downstairs are quite capable of-- Please sit down. We operate the world?s largest private investment fund. Our biggest problem is what to do with all the money. We have a cash surplus of 10 million a day? which we ship through our bank to the U.S. Federal Reserve? thus establishing credits which can be used for any legitimate investment. See, someone has to help the gringos with their trade deficit. Make out a deposit receipt for $4,900,000 for Se?or Bond. And, of course, there will be additional monthly deposits in the same amount. Of course. Be assured we are experienced in handling accounts of this nature. Let me pass. - Se?or Montelongo. - Yes? I?m Ms. Kennedy, Mr. Bond?s executive secretary. I?d also appreciate it? if you could establish a line of credit for me at the casino. - Shall we say, $2 million. - No problem. You have excellent collateral, and our chairman also owns the casino. - Oh, a very convenient arrangement. - We have always thought so, se?orita. Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. This is a very special night for us. We want you to know that only through your very generous donations? can the work here at the OMI continue to progress. We?ve learned so much, but we?ve only just scratched the surface. We need your help. We need you to go to your phones right now and make a pledge. This is not for me. This is not for them. This is for all of us. You okay, Renita? I?m fine. Krest called me from the boat with a story about somebody ripping him off. Did you see anything happen when you were there? No, Franz. I stayed in my cabin most of the time. - What?s the matter, baby? - You know I can?t stand that thing. I?d like a private table. Blackjack. Certainly, Se?or Bond. Would you come this way, please? Quarter of a million dollars. And I?d like to raise the limits to 5,000 a box. Put these volunteers behind me to work. Dario will take you shopping tomorrow evening. Spend a lot of money, have fun. Give me a kiss. You want one too? We can raise the price. Twenty-two thousand per kilo this month. I like that. - Are you still there? - Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge. Twenty-two thousand. Our goal today is to raise? $22,000 from each of our meditation chapters. That?s $22,000 each. Go to your phones. Please help us. Bless your hearts. Let me have half a million. Our wonderful Manhattan chapel has just made a special $500 pledge. Five hundred kilos. I-- I knew they?d go for it. This guy cracks me up. - Is Se?or Sanchez there? - Yes, he?s right here. I got a British sucker who dropped a quarter of a million? and he wants to play no limit. - Which one? - Table two. Plays like a real jerk-off. He flew in on a private plane today, opened an account at the bank. Five million dollars in cash. Let him play. Double down. Split. Listen to this-- our Chicago chapel has just received? a $1,000 donor pledge. They all accepted the new price. - Se?or Sanchez? - Yes, he?s right here. Thank you, Chicago. Bless your hearts. The British guy is a quarter of a million ahead. Should I close the table? - Tell Lupe to come in here. - Right. You have good luck tonight. You gonna share any of that money? Would you get me a medium-dry vodka martini? - Why do I-- - Shaken. Not stirred. Cut? - You?re very professional. - I used to work here. Am I going to win or lose? Lose. But not much. Vodka martini qu?? Shaken, not stirred. Looks like your luck has changed. - Is that why he sent you? - And to find out more about you. Perhaps I?d better quit for the night. You should walk straight out of here, go to the airport and never come back. Where?s Sanchez? Upstairs in his office. He?s been there all day. He?s planning a big party for some Orientals tomorrow night. And what did you tell him about the Wavekrest? Nothing. Now go. - Take me to him. - You loco? You?ll get us both killed. Buenas noches, se?or. This way, please. Send us a dollar. Send us 50 cents. Send whatever you can send. We?ve got a very special offer. You guys out there with your beer and popcorn-- Un momento, por favor. This is almost over. This particular book? has sold in excess of a quarter of a million copies. Anyone who sends in a $100 pledge or more will receive? a personally autographed copy of my book. Lovely view. It?s a $49.95 value? and you get it absolutely free. Bond. James Bond. Sit. Please. We need your help. Bless your hearts. Well-traveled man. You did all right at the tables tonight. I had the feeling my luck was about to change. Well, it?s a wise gambler who knows when his luck has run out. Why this? In my business you prepare for the unexpected. What business is that? I help people with problems. Problem solver. More of a problem eliminator. - I know you?re here on business. - No. Temporarily unemployed. I thought I might find work here. Well, it?s very difficult to obtain a work permit in Isthmus. It?s, uh-- Well, one has to show a special talent that people here don?t have. Well, that shouldn?t be too difficult. Se?or Bond, you got big cojones. You come here to my place? without references? carrying a piece? throwing around a lot of money. But you should know something. Nobody saw you come in? so nobody has to see you go out. Se?or Sanchez, I could be very useful to a man in your position. And I understand you have a reputation for rewarding loyalty very well. I?ll keep this for a few days. We?ll talk again. And you won?t need a gun in Isthmus. It?s a very safe city. In the meantime, I welcome you to the casino at all times. Check him out. What did you find out? He?s sitting up there behind two inches of armored glass. I?d need a cannon to get to him. Your uncle has arrived. I put him in your suite. Thank you. Good night, se?or. Your uncle? Let?s make this a proper family reunion. Give me your gun. Stay here. - Really, 007! - Q! What are you doing here? I might have killed you! Well, I?m on leave. Thought I?d pop around and see how you were getting on. - You all right? - Yes, of course. - How did you find me? - Moneypenny, of course. - She?s worried sick about you. - This is no place for you. Go home. Oh, don?t be an idiot, 007. I know exactly what you?re up to, and you?re going to need my help. If it hadn?t been for Q Branch, you?d have been dead long ago. Everything for a man on holiday. Explosive alarm clock. Guaranteed never to wake up anybody who uses it. Dentonite toothpaste. To be used sparingly. It?s the latest in plastic explosive. I could do with some plastic. I thought there might be a mess to clean up. Pam, this is Q, my uncle. Uncle, this is Ms. Kennedy, my cousin. - We must be related. - How do you do? Now, pay attention, 007. This looks like an ordinary camera. - Doesn?t it? - What kind of film does it take? 120? No? 220 high velocity. Now, this is a signature gun? and that is an optical palm reader. And if I plug this into the bottom like that? once I?ve programmed it? Now nobody can use the gun but you. Smile, boys. Don?t use the flash. Stop fiddling about with things you don?t understand. - You might easily have killed him. - That?s odd. Let?s all get some rest. We?ve got a long, hard day ahead of us tomorrow. Good night, Q. Sweet dreams, Mr. Bond. I hope you don?t snore, Q. You all know Truman-Lodge. This is my head of security, Colonel Heller. This is an historic moment. East meets west. Drug dealers of the world unite. Extra bonus. Your job?s done. Take Q and fly out of here now. I?ll make my own way back. I?d like to stay. I work better alone. In this business there?s a lot of cash and lots of people with their hands out. In a word, bribery. Exactly. He took the words right out of my pocket. So you pay. Everyone and his brother is on the payroll. So you buy a man-- a chief of police, a general-- A president. One day you wake up and you own the whole goddamn country. Then you take what you want-- bank, gambling casino, airline concession. Why? Simple. It?s easier for the politicians? to take silver than lead. We have an invisible empire from Chile to Alaska. What I want to do, amigos, is to make you part of it. I want the Pacific to be our little puddle. What you have before you, gentlemen, is a demographic report? breaking down each of your territories by age? and socioeconomic group. As you can clearly see? there is a huge potential demand? given the implementation of aggressive marketing. As in the United States? Se?or Sanchez is prepared to offer each of you exclusive franchises. The price is 100 million per territory. I believe you?ll find that works out to? 20 million per metric ton, Mr. Tan. We guarantee quality and price? for five years. Since arriving, we?ve eaten well? heard many good stories. But before I pay anything, I want to see some hardware. Mr. Kwang, you don?t pay for hardware. You pay for my personal guarantee and protection. Surely if you were to invest 100 million? you would want some reassurance. You know, you?re right. Why not? Tomorrow I?ll take you to our main distribution center. Here you are. Good-bye, Q. Thanks for all you?ve done. What? You?re a hell of a field operative. Now go. I?ll see you back in London. No more business. Time to have some fun. Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves. - Hello there. - Hi! How are you? You can be my playmate. This Kwang seems like trouble. Why show them the labs? Don?t worry. They won?t expose the operation. His Excellency, el presidente Lopez. There has been a mistake with my check. Look at it. It?s half the usual amount. You were very quiet when I was arrested. Remember? you?re only president for life. Watch the birdie, you bastard. Take his arm. Who would have a signature gun? James Bond. This is the property of Her Majesty?s government. How did you get it? Piss off. - Who ordered you to kill Sanchez? - No one. He?s a rogue agent. I?ve got orders to take him back one way or the other. We?re Hong Kong Narcotics, you bastard! Sanchez is taking us to the heart of his operations. I?ve been setting it up for years. I just hope that little stunt of yours hasn?t scared him off. - Get me out of these bloody things. - No, Commander. You?re a loose cannon on deck. I?m shipping you straight back to London. - Leave him! - No! Come on! Don?t let them take you alive. He?s still alive. Who was it? Who sent you? Cyanide. How do you feel? I?ll survive. Lupe. Please. The Wavekrest is arriving tonight. Krest is coming here. No, no, I?ll call you back. Good. Baby. Please? Well, we both had close calls last night. You were just in time. Things were about to turn nasty. - Who were those guys? - Freelance hit team. What did they want with you? One of them must have recognized me in the casino. They were afraid I?d warn you, spoil their plans. So you knew them. I used to be a British agent. We kept dossiers on such people. British agent. I knew it. You have class. Those men tried to kill me. Who would do such a thing? Someone close to you. - Cream? Sugar? - No. - Did they tell you this? - They were well briefed. Obviously by someone on the inside. - Did they mention a name? - No. Only that they were expecting to be paid a great deal of cash? by someone arriving in Isthmus tonight. Do you suspect someone? Everyone in my organization is 100% loyal. - Then you have nothing to worry about. - Yeah, well, I have to meet some people. - Rest here. - No, I have to go back to my hotel. No, don?t go to the hotel. Save your money. I insist. Stay here. Enjoy my hospitality. Lupe, show him the easy way up, please. You are not going to believe who this guy is. Former British agent. How did you know that? Because I know things. I want to meet Krest?s boat tonight. We?ll need a dozen reliable men. - Is there a problem with Krest? - We?ll see. And bring Lupe. She was there. He?s not gonna lie in front of her. What are you doing? I?ve had my fill of Sanchez? hospitality. He told you to stay. You?re asking for trouble. There?s no need for you to get involved. Give me five minutes, then scream. James, listen to me. There?s guards all over the place. You?ll never make it. I?m going shopping. I won?t be long. Please don?t! Not now! Se?or Sanchez said! - I haven?t had one of these in 5 years. - Oh, don?t worry. 007 always comes back. - James, hi-- - Thought I told you to leave, Q. We couldn?t go without knowing what had happened to you. Get your bags packed, Q. - What?s the matter with you? - Just a couple of things. Kwang and his team were British agents. They?re dead. Sanchez is alive. I saw you in Heller?s office. You?re working with them. - I want the truth. - I?m telling the truth! Sanchez has arranged to buy four Stinger missiles from the contras? and he said he?ll shoot down an American airliner if the D.A. doesn?t lay off. What?s that got to do with you and Heller? Felix gave me a letter from the attorney general granting Heller immunity? if he gets the Stingers back. Did he go for the deal? Yes. And then you missed Sanchez? and Heller panicked and said the deal was off? and that I was dead if he ever saw me again. There?s more to this than your personal vendetta. It?s a mess. Sanchez has tripled his security. You?ll never get another shot at him. We don?t have to. Meet me at the harbor master?s office in two hours. Q, bring the Rolls around to the front of the hotel. Yes, sir! Se?or Montelongo, I?m making a withdrawal. Pilot coming aboard, sir. Well? Take me to the bridge. Gracias, Captain. I?ll take over now. You? You?re the harbor pilot? No, I?m his secretary. All yours, sir-- ma?am. - You?re going in a bit too fast. - You wanna do the driving? You take the wheel. Full speed astern! - What?s happening? - I don?t know! We?ve hit the jetty! What the hell are you doing? Harbor pilot went crazy. I?d stick to flying if I were you. I got the job done. Franz! What a surprise. I didn?t think you?d be here. Yeah. I like surprises. You seem to be having a lot of problems lately. Well, we had this crazy harbor pilot. Let?s talk about the money you owe me. Why don?t we talk inside. - Does he have a safe? - Not up here. Maybe below. Have a look around. Check the bow and give me a damage report. Do I have this right? He water-skied behind the plane, jumps on it-- He was-- Well, yeah. He threw the pilots out and flew away. Like a little bird. Knife. Would I make up a story like that? You must have seen something. - Where?s 007? - He?s coming. That?s not my money. - I swear. - That?s right, amigo. It?s mine. Do you think I?m stupid? Huh? You rip me off, then use my own money to pay someone to kill me? You want it so bad? Then take it! What are you doing? Wait! Just please talk to me! It?s not my money! What the-- Please, Franz! What about the money, patr?n? Launder it. This is where you leave. Take the plane. I?ll see you both in Miami. - Aren?t you coming? - No. They?ll be after me. It?ll be safer on my own. Come on, my dear. See you later. - What?s that? - Bond?s clothes. They?re clean. I?m sorry to wake you, hermano. I thought you?d like to know the information you gave me paid off. I got the guy who set me up. Only one guy. - What do you mean? - I just thought that-- No one would be stupid enough to try to take you on on their own. - Listen, come with me tomorrow. - Where? It?s a surprise. You?re gonna like it. James, what are you doing back here? I don?t think your being here is a good idea. It?s all right. Franz is having dinner with the Chinese. - Where is he taking me tomorrow? - He?s showing them a special place. I don?t know where. James, don?t go. I?m scared. What?s gonna happen to us? Don?t worry. When this is all over I?ll make sure you get back home. Home? It took me 15 years to get away from there. I don?t want to go back. Can?t we leave together? I ought to be safe with you. No, Lupe. I don?t think that would work out. How can we tell unless we try? I think it?s gonna work out very well. All right. I?ll answer it. Ms. Kennedy? I saw you at the casino with James. - We need to speak in private. - It?s all right. He?s with me. James is in danger. Sanchez is no fool. He?s checking up on him. - If they find anything suspicious-- - He?s safely out of the country by now. You don?t understand. Last night he stayed with me. At Sanchez? house? Franz is taking him on a trip in an hour. You must help him. If anything happens to him I don?t know what I?ll do. I love James so much. You must go before you?re missed. Now, don?t worry. We?ll think of something. ?I love James so much.? I?ll be damned if I?ll help him. Look, don?t judge him too harshly, my dear. Field operatives must often use every means at their disposal? to achieve their objectives. Bullshit! Bond?s just left in convoy. Two cars and a Jeep turning north onto the main highway. - I copy that, Q. - Over and out. What are you doing to my plane? Overhaul. Se?or Sanchez ordered it. I must have a plane. Where can I rent one? No planes. You brought the Stingers, Manito. From now on I want them close to me. We started this place strictly as a cover? but Professor Joe manages to turn a tidy profit. Welcome. This way, please. I?m going to have to ask that each of you put on one of these. It?s for your own safety? so I?m sure you?ll understand. We can?t have our best customers developing a drug habit. This way, gentlemen. Attention, Security. Stand by to receive Number One. Our product dissolves completely in ordinary gasoline? making it absolutely undetectable. How do you get it back? You want us to tell you all our secrets before we?re partners? - Take them to the lab. - This way, gentlemen. Who?s the new guy? Somebody I thought could be useful. - Can I help you? - I have a surprise for Professor Joe. - Sorry. No visitors this week. - I came all the way from Wichita Falls. - I?m sorry. - Folks back home took up a collection. They?d be so disappointed if Prof. Joe didn?t accept it personally. You may remove your masks now, gentlemen. So, do we have a deal? The terms, gentlemen, were? 100 million in negotiable bearer bonds from each of you. Welcome. Professor Joe, it?s really you. Oh, it?s magnificent. Rebuilt stone for stone and restored to its original glory. - Is this for me? - Oh, yes, I almost forgot. I got so flustered, I-- Have you ever thought of studying here? Would that be possible? Come along. Let?s see if you have the aptitude. To a long association. - What?s the process? - It?s very simple. An 18% mixture of cocaine and ordinary gasoline. Just keep quiet. Ammonium hydroxide. We already have your first shipment loaded into the four tanker trucks. Welcome. Please join me. Wow! This is my humble sanctuary away from the cares of the world. Your own private meditation chamber. Built from the sacred rocks of the original temple. I did have it soundproofed, so nothing will disturb our meditation. I brought you another surprise. I love surprises. Where is it? Look, this really isn?t necessary. Give me the keys. Bless your heart. Your monthly delivery will be by oceangoing tanker. We?ll send our chief chemist along to supervise the reconversion process. You keep the gas as a bonus. And if there?s a problem with customs? no evidence. Come on! Hurry! I know him! He?s an informer! You disappoint me. Who are you working for? Huh? Tell me! You don?t wanna talk? I can get the trucks out, but I don?t think I can control the fire! Forget the fire! Get some cars! We?re gonna take the tankers with us! Wait a minute. This setup cost us 32 million. We have to try and save it. I don?t give a shit! We got 500 million in the case and 20 tons of Colombian pure in the tankers! Now go help Heller! But we have a deal with the Orientals. We?ve got their money. Go help Heller! Do you wanna make this hard or easy? Put him in the conveyor. When you?re up to your ankles, you?re gonna beg to tell me everything. When you?re up to your knees, you?ll kiss my ass to kill you. I?m the least of your problems. If you couldn?t trust Krest, who can you trust? Who?s got your 500 million? Truman-Lodge. What about the Stingers? What do you know about Stingers? We gotta go. This place will blow up any second. - Where?s Heller? - I don?t know. That?s the last you?ll see of Heller and your Stingers. Thanks for the advice. Have my car meet me up at the top! Come with me. You?re dead. You took the words right out of my mouth. Sanchez! - Are you all right? - Switch the bloody machine off! Hey. I was making sure these were secure. That?s a good idea. - Take them up to my car. - Of course, sir. - Oh, God, it?s Heller. - Looks like he came to a dead end. Come on! You. Come with me. Come on. Surprise! Bless your heart! Bond has escaped. Meet me at Paso del Diablo. Don?t worry. It?s only money. Oh, no. Shit! Brilliant! Well done, Franz. Another $80 million write-off! I guess it?s time to start cutting overhead. James! You could have had everything. Don?t you want to know why? Well, what are you waiting for? Get in. Yes, sir. - I?ll be up to see you next week. - Good. I?ll be out by then. M called. He tried to reach you. I think he may have a job for you. Look, Felix, I have to go. My hostess has just arrived. - Take care, James. - You too. Bye-bye. - I thought you hated that thing. - Don?t you know? Iguanas are a girl?s best friend. - Well, here?s to you, my dear. - Cheers. Thank you for everything, James. Thank you. You could stay here with me. Excuse me. I think you and el presidente will make a perfect couple. Why don?t you wait until you?re asked? So why don?t you ask me?
