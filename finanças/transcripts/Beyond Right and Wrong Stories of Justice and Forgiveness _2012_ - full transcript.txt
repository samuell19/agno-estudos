There could hardly have been a more pointed prelude to the other main event of the day -- a huge peace march in the Irish Republic by contingents from North and South who've had enough of this kind of violence, and worse. In 1984, we targeted the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where the Conservative Party were holding a conference. My sister woke me up and said, "Which hotel is -- is dad in? There's been a bomb in Brighton. It's on the news." In that operation, five people were killed. Over 30 people were injured. How dareanybody think their need to be heard is so important that they've killed my father. ♪♪ ♪♪ People talk about, "The pen is mightier than the sword." I think that's true, but I think that the -- the spoken word and the spoken story is even more powerful than the pen because I think it goes further and deeper into the psyche of human beings. Sometimes people tell stories and all they do is tell their own story. That's not enough. You have to tell your own story, but you also have to hear the story of the -- of the enemy. You have to tell the story of the people that you have fought with and argued with, and perhaps killed. You have to tell those stories. A short while ago, it was confirmed that one of the dead is the MP for Enfield Southgate, Sir Anthony Berry, who was treasurer of the royal household. I was caught for that operation and sentenced to eight life sentences, with a recommendation that I do fifty years before being considered for release, but was released after 14 years, due to the -- the peace process. Emotional family reunion for Catholic prisoners, most from the Irish Republican Army. Among their number, convicted bombers, snipers, and murderers. It was just after Patrick Magee had been released from prison that I actually began to feel the anger and the rage. Patrick Magee, a convicted IRA bomber, walked free from the Maze Prison in Belfast. And, suddenly, I was back in the day, like it was happening, and it was a very scary experience because the emotions were -- were of the day, not of 1999, and part of that was this incredible anger and rage. You know, how can someone play God? You know. And -- and now he's free and I'm -- I'm left with it and, you know, no one's need to be heard is so great that they should kill. ♪♪ ♪♪ Getting out, I mean, the first thing is to get your life back in some semblance of order. Then, out of the blue, I was contacted by Jo Berry. I wanted to put more attention and energy to the part of me that must find alternatives to blaming, you know, because then, I'd stay a victim forever. I think Jo wanted to meet me to understand wh-why her father died. I thought, one meeting, say what I have to say, which would've been, I suppose, a defense of what I did, in terms of the politics, but also, you know, show some sensitivity towards her and -- perhaps express regret at the loss and that would be it. We'd -- We'd part and that'd be it. I remember sitting in my friend's kitchen in -- in Dublin and knock at the door and I knew it was Pat and... I'd -- I was in such a state of anxiety and kind of, "Should I be here, even?" You know, doubting whether it was the right thing to do and -- and he walked in and I got up and shook his hand and thanked him for coming. Part of me was thinking, "Maybe he won't turn up." He said, "No, no, I want to thank you." He was, very, very polite and I remember looking at him and thinking, "You've killed. You've killed my dad." The first hour, Pat talked a lot about the struggle and why he joined the IRA and defending his use of violence. Why the IRA bomb the Grand Hotel? It was because the Conservative Party were -- were holding their annual conference and were using that hotel. I mean, so, therefore, people in government who made the decisions that had directly affected what was happening in the streets here, that were in control of the oppression, you know, were all there together. I mean, it seemed quite obvious, you know, that this presented a great target for us. And I was listening and asking questions and telling him about my father and what had happened to me since then and -- and after about an hour, an hour and a half, he stopped talking and he sort of -- he wiped -- wiped his eye and -- and he said, I don't know what to say anymore. I don't know who -- who I am." And, in that moment, I think part of me wanted to run away 'cause I thought -- I realized that this was the beginning of another journey. I mean, I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that somebody who I've hurt, I've killed her father, is still prepared to come and listen to me and to talk to me and to respect my point of view. He'd opened up and it was no longer just him defending himself, you know, he'd become vulnerable and we were starting something together and I didn't know where it was going to take us. But I think there was a -- a need felt, from both of us, to meet again, as if, you know, we'd left the conversation short. There was more talk about. We must've been in similar circumstances some fifty times. It doesn't get easy. Teacher training college established -- It's lovely. How old is it? Well, it's 100 years old. Then, to the right -- Please welcome Jo Berry and Pat Magee. Would you class yourself or -- or would've classed, been classed as a soldier or a terrorist? I can understand, after all the decades of misrepresentation, while it would be difficult for people here, people in this audience, to think of me as a soldier and feel, perhaps, comfortable with the idea that I'm a terrorist, in a post-9/11 world, it's meant to explain a lot and explains nothing. A word that my readers would use is murderer. You were charged with murder of several people. I had a very strong experience about labels and what they mean when I was at a -- a workshop in Northern Ireland and I was sitting round the table and there was somebody there who'd been a British soldier, Pat had been the IRA, and somebody who'd been in the Loyalist paramilitary and the UDA. I could've been all their sisters. I could've been their mothers. I could've been them, you know. And, at that moment, the labels are gone and they're just human beings because of what they've been through. Did you ever feel hatred and revenge? Yes, I have felt anger. When I felt that kind of pain, you know, just absolute bottom pain, I think I had a choice to not go for the revenge, but to end that cycle. It's a choice to see the enemy as a human being, rather than as just the -- the enemy. Does it not seem, to Miss Berry, that she may be an apologist for one of the most horrifying crimes of this century? I'm true to myself and I trust my inner impulse. It seems to be great psychotherapy for you, and it seems to be a great confessional for Dr. Magee, but I'm not quite sure what the rest of us are getting out of it. I think I'm actually quite a challenging option for Pat. I actually think he's extremely courageous to sit with me. He said, many times, that it'd be much easier for him, if I'd met him with anger and with political debate, but the fact that I listened to him, gave him respect, right from the beginning, that was harder. You can probably gather, from what Pat said, that, you know, at times, it is hard to face me and the more he knows me, as a person, and the more he knows about my father, the harder it is to know that he's hurt me. He lives with that contradiction, that difficulty. You know, we have this tension between us of that all the time. Well, one thing that hit me after -- I couldn't tell you when, exactly, this happened. You talked about your father and I got more of a picture. He was a human being who had shaped you. In other words, all the things that I admire in you came, in some measure, from your father. That meant this was a fine human being and I killed him. So, that's heavy, you know. You -- It gives you a measure of the loss. And I end up, now, a very conflicted person. Um -- Conflicted because, while I can look at the past and have an understanding that we had no other option, I also know and carry this heavy burden that I hurt human beings. Doesn't matter that they wore uniforms and that we can justify -- I can justify actions in the past. I hurt human beings and I carry that, that burden and... ...meeting you puts your father there, too. He's a human being to me now. He wasn't a human being before. He was a demonized enemy. He was a, you know, he was a Tory.

Very difficult. I -- I don't think it was. I don't think it was worth 3,600 deaths, in any shape or form. Forty yearsof killing each other and hurting each other before we came to a position where we said, "Well, we better get in a room somewhere and begin to talk about this." We started to find agreement about how we would talk. Very practical. It's, "How many days a week? You know, where would we meet? Who would be there? How many people would be there? What shape would the table be?" You know all very practical things. And people got fed up. They said, "These people aren't serious," you know. You used to laugh about talks about talks, about talks, about talks. But, actually, it was really important. People often say, "Ooh, they can't talk 'cause there's no trust." Trust is an outcome of a context like this, not a prerequisite for it, and trust comes because I say to you, "Will we meet at 9:00 tomorrow morning?" And you say, "Um, could we make it quarter past 9:00?" I say, "Okay, we'll make it a quarter past 9:00," and, tomorrow morning, you come at a quarter past 9:00 and I say, "Okay, I can trust her." ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ They said there was a bombing in Ben Yehuda Street.

"How could it be? What can cause someone to be that angry, that mad, that he's willing to kill himself with little girls?"

We both paid the highest price possible. Our blood is the same color. Our pain is exactly the same pain and the tears are just as bitter. And I think the most important question that you ask yourself is what can you do personally, you know, to prevent this unbearable pain from others? And the turning point was a year later, when I met the leader of the Families Forum, who invited me over to watch a meeting of this group of crazy people. I saw people who paid the highest price possible, who chose the way of dialogue, instead of hatred, but then, I saw the Palestinian bereaved families coming down from the buses, coming towards me, shaking my hand for peace, hugging me, crying with me. I was completely shocked. I was -- I'm ashamed to say I was 47 years old at the time. It was the first time, ever in my life, that I met Palestinians as human beings, as people who carry the same burden that I do, as people who suffer exactly the same way. I was completely shocked. I saw people, human beings, not as workers in the streets, not as tourists, not as news items -- as people.

No. I think there's a general belief that forgiveness precludes justice. And I don't think that's the case at all. I think justice is very important. It is part of the healing process.

And people may not stay in jail as long as some people would want them, but that is a practical solution sometimes. Concessions have to be made for the greater good. Crowded together like animals in a stockyard, they wait for trials to decide their fate, virtually all accused of genocide. Opening new detention centers has only slightly eased overcrowding and there's increasing pressure on Rwanda's government to start the long-awaited judicial process that will decide guilt or innocence for each of these prisoners.

There was no appetite, either from the government or survivors, simply to release everybody without some form of justice. So, basically, our Gacaca Courts did a tremendous job. To have the community own the justice, as they own the pain, and they were the ones who saw the people hack each other to death. They know who killed who. So, giving them the opportunity to solve this problem, by judging them, makes the community healed. You know, nobody's happy with the situation, that's the problem. So we end up with, you know, some of the suspects and perpetrators who complain they've been in prison too long or that they've been there without trial or they've not had enough defense. And then, the survivors are saying, "Well, what kind of justice is this? These people, you know, killed five members of my family and then what do they do? Get a couple of years in some community sentence and they're back living next door. And, by the way, they've got everything. They've got their whole family around them.

Thirty-three years ago, on the 4th of May 1972, I think we came across each other for the first time." When I was ten years old, I got out of school, as normal. I had to pass this British Army lookout post. And, as I ran past the Army post, a British soldier fired a rubber bullet. He said that he fired the rubber bullet in the hope that we would all bugger off home. Well, I was at the bottom of the playground and the Army sanger was there and what would've happened is, you know, young people would've gathered there at times and threw bricks at the sanger. I've done it meself in the past. So it was just a normal day, about 20 past 3:00, and, up behind those houses, there was an Army lookout post. And, as I ran past the sanger, that's when the soldier fired the rubber bullet. I spent about two weeks in hospital. Me brother Noel said to me, "Richard, do you know what damage was done?" And that's when he told me that I lost me right eye and I would never be able to see again with me left eye. It struck me here, on the bridge of the nose. I lost this eye and was left completely blind in me left eye. I just accepted it. I just accepted it, as if they had just told me that Derry City they lost the football match at the weekend or something. Until that night, really, and, when I was in bed that night, on me own, I cried. And I cried because I realized, for the first time, that I was never going to see me mammy or me daddy's faces again. November 2005. I found out the soldier's name and then, I wrote him a letter and the letter was hand-delivered to him. "Since I was a young teenager, I have always said that I would like to meet the soldier who shot me and now, I can't believe, after all these years, that you're sitting, reading my letter. Charles, I hope you will say yes to me. I'm confident you won't regret it, in any way. Finally, thanks for reading this letter and I look forward to your response, if and when it comes. Richard Moore." The first day that I found out his name, everything changed. He wasn't a soldier, then. He was Charles. I'd give him a -- You know, he was a human being, in a sense, and that sort of distance that the term "soldier" creates was brought a bit closer by saying "Charles." I tried to reassure him, in the letter, that I wasn't writing to make him feel guilty. I wasn't writing to make him accountable to me. I also wanted to meet him -- and I told him this in the letter -- to let him know that I have no hatred towards him and never had any hatred towards him. ♪♪ I arranged to meet him on the 14th of January 2006. ♪♪ There was a bit of small talk, at the start. But eventually, I said, "Look, Charles, in your letter, it said you felt justified and I find that hard to swallow, that you can justify blinding a 10-year-old boy." And he said, well, what he meant by that was, when he decided to fire the rubber bullet, he felt justified in firing it. If he had known the damage that it was going to cause, then he wouldn't have fired it, and he was not justifying what happened to me. And Charles said, at that point, "Look, I regret what happened. I wish I'd never fired the rubber bullet. And, if I had known the damage that I was going to cause, I wouldn't have fired it." Now, you could pick holes in that story, if you wanted. You could go down all sorts of roads, in relation to what Charles is saying. What Charles done that day, only he knows what was going on in his head. I'm not saying that what Charles done was right. I'm not saying it was justified. What I'm saying is that I forgive Charles for what happened. In unusual circumstances, unusual things happen and there's no question that Derry and Northern Ireland was an unusual place. And I think we're all very lucky, if we get through our life without doing something we live to regret for the rest of our lives. Forgiving Charles wasn't going to change the past. It wasn't going to give me back me eyesight. But what it did do is change my future. I didn't carry all that baggage of hurt and anger. And I think it would've prevented me from operating and living me life as a fully functional human being, in the way that I have. ♪♪ ♪♪ I do actually believe that we're all capable, given the right circumstances, of doing anything, just about anything.

I've always believed that any of us are actually capable of doing anything, under certain circumstances. What allows one group of human beings to annihilate another group is if they find a way of dehumanizing them. Now, you do that by taking aspects of yourself that you hate, that you feel are bad, despicable, and you want to disown them, and you put them into the victim. Then, the victim is experienced as a disease or a scourge and can be annihilated. You also, the same way, extract anything good from them and attribute that to yourself -- "I'm civilized and you're a savage." For forgiveness to occur, the process must be put into reverse, so to speak, as where the victim has to see the perpetrator as not all bad or evil, and this can occur if they see that the perpetrator shows genuine remorse, guilt, and takes real steps to repair or rebuild the damage they've done. One day, you might forgive, the next day, something triggers it, and you might hate all over again. As you move forward again, something comes to your mind that takes you back to what happened in the past. But gradually, a little bit further down the line, you can begin to let go of the pain. For me, forgiveness is difficult, costly, painful, however, potentially transformative. My mum's body was maimed.

They asked me if I wanted to go to his trial and I had no desire to do that at all. I don't -- It doesn't give me -- There's no punishment. Will that bring back David, if I feel good about the fact that he's rotting in jail and his mother is sitting in Silwad without him? She's lost a child, also, in a way. So what joy could that bring me, that he's sitting in jail? No. I don't even-- I didn't even get involved in that side of it at all. The memory for me is David sitting down there and going like this when he drove off. That's much more important for me. It's strange because, when the army came to tell me that David had been killed, the first -- apparently -- thing I said is, "You may not kill anybody in the name of my child." One of the projects that we did in the Parents Circle -- you know, we are 500 families of Palestinians and Israelis -- we understood that we shared the same pain. We thought that it would be very important to share each other's historical narrative and personal narrative, in order to understand the other's point of view. And we decided that we would go to the Holocaust Museum. We invited 70 Palestinians to first come and stay overnight in East Jerusalem, so that they wouldn't have the indignities of coming through the checkpoint the next day and that we could meet them at the Holocaust Museum in a dignified manner. Then, the next day, we went to this village which existed before 1948. It's called Ekbeba. Two of the Palestinian families from our group come from there. And, when we got there, there was nothing left of this village. It was wiped out completely. And, suddenly, Umm Jamil, who's the mother from Dheisheh refugee camp, stood there and she started to cry. And we looked at her and we said, "What's the matter?" And she looked down and she said, "You see here? This is the well that I used to draw water out of as a child." And then, we could understand this longing, you know, this, "Why do people walk around with keys to doors that are no longer there," you know? And you could understand, with empathy, this pain of longing and, as Jews, we need to understand that, you know? We came out of Toledo, in Spain, and walked around with keys around our neck for generations. For me, reconciliation is to be able -- not to forget your pain. It's to be able to create kind of a package, where you put your pain there, you specific this pain in a specific place, and you don't allow this pain to control your mind and your feeling and your daily life and to bring you to madness. Three years ago -- or four years. I'm not good at time -- they caught the sniper who killed David. His name was Tha'ir. And I decided that I couldn't do this work, if I wasn't willing to go on a path and so I wrote a letter to the family. And, about two weeks ago, I came home at about 11:00 and I found an email from a friend of mine in America, who said that the sniper and -- had written me a letter, but not directly, and that the letter was printed in Ma'an, which is the Palestinian news service. And I discovered a letter filled with... justification for killing and that my son was a murderer and that he could have nothing to do with me and didn't want me anywhere near his family and would not write me a letter directly. The next morning, I got up very early and I turned on the BBC and, suddenly, I heard Jo Berry on the radio, together with Pat Magee, discussing their journey to reconciliation. So I thought, "What you're doing is right," and I went away and I wrote another letter. And I think I would like to read you that letter. "Tha'ir, how ironic. The people who most wanted to protect me from your words in your letter were my Palestinian friends and other bereaved parents in our group. You said that David went to the army to kill. This young man spent most of his time helping to make a difference, educating towards democracy, and who anguished about going to serve said, 'If I go, I will treat all with respect and so will my soldiers.' I think that these are not words of a violent man. You claim that you killed ten soldiers and civilians in order to end the occupation. Do you think that you made a difference? I'm well aware, from your family, and have shared the story all over the world, of your uncle, who was violently killed by Israeli soldiers in front of you when you were a small child, and of the uncle you lost in the Second Intifada. I think there was a definite longing for revenge. I also think that you will find out, with time, that there is no revenge for a loved one. The wisest reaction I had to the words of your letter came from my wonderful son Eran, who I thought would be terribly angry. 'Well,' he said, 'Listen, Mum, perhaps this is the beginning of a dialogue.'" What revenge could I take to bring David back? You could take anything from me, and everything, if I could just, once more, see him and once more talk to him. So, I'm very worried and reluctant to use the word forgiving. Is it giving up your right to justice? Does it mean that it's okay, what they did, or they can do it again? Or do you forget? I don't know, you know? I don't know. I don't know. I know that the sniper is on the list to be freed, you know, for Gilad Shalit, for the soldier. And I know, absolutely, here, I'm being honest, they must release him, if it will bring back this kid. Firstly, nohuman life -- the sanctity of human life is much more important than any small revenge that I might take. And, you know, when you think about the generations of children and grandchildren of these prisoners, who are so angry and want revenge, then what is more dangerous -- releasing them back into the community or facing further generations, two or three generations, of revenge? So I say -- and I've said it on television, many times -- that you must release the prisoners. I often say people make the mistake that they think politics is about agreeing with each other. It's not. Politics is about how we disagree with each other without killing each other. Because these are issues of relationships, they're only ever going to be solved by people talking with each other. In other words, force and violence is never going to bring a resolution of the problem. ♪♪ ♪♪ This is a place where Israelis and Palestinians are meeting each other for peace. You know, you can always cross the wall. You can go under the wall. You can go behind the wall. You can go above the wall. This wall cannot stop two kinds of people -- the one determined suicide bomber will find a way to go through, and the one determined peacemaker will find a way to go through. But I think the basic reason behind it all is prevention of any kind of dialogue and knowing each other. And this is something that, for me, as a peacemaker, is essential to go to, even at the price of breaking the law. ♪♪ Am I afraid? No, I'm not afraid. As I said earlier, the worst thing already happened. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ It's easy to say, "Forgive and forget." It's very hard to achieve that. It is not improbable that one of the Palestinians today would've been killed by me ten years ago. Then he wouldn't be with us, or I wouldn't be here with you today to do this -- this joint activity. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ This is a mission. This is something that I have to do. This is the reason for me to get out of bed in the morning. This is the meaning of my life after the death of my daughter. We can change this endless cycle of violence, the only way out is the ability to listen to the pain of the other. When all the other extremities are passed away, and you go beyond the story to where there is nothing left but the two people, and you feel that what you are meeting is the other person, then I think reconciliation, forgiveness, bonding and even love begins to happen. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
