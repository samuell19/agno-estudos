Eight hundred... thirty... Mechanoid... English... input... enter. Advance and attack! Destroy and rejoice! You heard what the gentleman said Let's go! We're going up. Yeah, it's a lift Yes you... you got us out of a nasty situation there. I supposed you'd like to know who we are and why we're here, mmm? You're not getting through to him, Doctor, you're not getting through. Doctor, ask him where he's taking us. He's taking us up to the city, obviously. They have escaped. Not possible. Perceptor readings indicated they were here. Subject walls to seismic detector tests. It is required that we penetrate this wall. Section four will return to the time craft for the electrode unit. We obey. We must have arrived. Stop. Follow... follow. Look at it! But's fantastic! I've never seen anything like it. It's huge! English... enter... enter... zero... stop. Enter, enter, zero, stop? What does he mean? It means, er, enter, enter, zero, stop. Tttthhhaaannnk yyyooouuu! Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha! Vicki! What an extraordinary looking thing! Ha, looks like a monkey's perch. Oh, not bad, eh? Yes, well I don't like it. Why not? It's clean, it's comfortable, the robot's seem quite friendly. Yes, yes, robot's, but haven't you noticed something very singular about this place? Like what? We've only seen robots. No animal life, human or otherwise, mm? That's very true, Doctor. Stay where you are! You real? Who are you? You are real! From Earth? Yes. Who are you? From Earth, that... couldn't have happened! I... I worked out the odds two thousand to one ag... hey! I supposed they realised I was on my way back wh... well, who won the wars? Look, I'm Steven Taylor, flight red-fifty. Well, we've learned something... His name! Hmm! Yes, Steven Taylor. Say that again. Steven Taylor? Steven Taylor... That's my mascot - Hi-fi. Hi Fi, I'm Barbara! I'm Vicki. Ian Chesterton. This is the Doctor. Well, I'm glad to know you, Steven Taylor. Well... this is great! I... I mean it's ridiculous. I'm lost for words, I... I thought if ever I met anyone again I wouldn't stop talking for a week! Ye-es! Well, you haven't! How long have you been here, mm? As far as I can make out, about two years. Two years? Alone? Well yes... apart from those fungus things. You mean there's no other human beings here on this planet. No, nothing except the Mechonoids. Where do they come from, do you know? You don't know? But this is Mechanus. Sorry? Look, about fifty years ago, Earth decided to colonise this planet. Well, it landed a rocket full of robots programmed to clear landing sites get everything ready to... for the first immigrants. And they didn't arrive? No. The Earth got involved in interplanetary wars an... I suppose this place was forgotten. Fifty years ago? But surely these robots'd be worn out by now. They'd have run down. No, no, no, no, they're programmed to do their own repairs. But if you're waiting for people from Earth, well why not us? Yes, we could be the immigrants. Look, you've got to know their code. I've been spending two years trying to break it. Ha, two years. I crashed you see out there in the jungle and wandered around for days trying to avoid those fungus things. Of course then the Mechonoids captured me. Captured? Do you mean... you're a prisoner. Well, do you think I'd stay here otherwise? I'm just like you - we're all prisoners! Help yourself to a piece of eternity. Now just a minute! There are five of us now. Surely we can do something? We can fight our way, we can fight our way out of here. Look, at the first sign of violence towards them, the Mechonoids destroy. Now what's this? What are they playing at? Yes, I see. We're being held here... as specimens. What? Like something in a zoo? Yes, Vicki. Exactly like a zoo. Only we're the specimens that are on display. Aren't we, my fat little darlings?! Electrode unit ready. Operate. Increase power... conveyor descending. By taking the humans the Mechons have forced us to take action against them. We invade. Skaro reports they have many powerful weapons. We may sustain damage. The orders of the Dalek Supreme will be obeyed! The humans will be destroyed! The Mechons will not be permitted to stand in our way! We attack! We attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Oh, go away! Leave us alone, can't you?! Threat... stop. There's only one thing to do to keep yourself sane that's to make things. I built this All my own work. Where does it lead? The roof! Well, why don't we get out that way? Look, don't think I haven't thought about it myself but that roof's fifteen hu... hundred feet above ground level. Well, we've got to get out. Yes, that's what I thought at first. You'll soon find out you're better off here than out there in the jungle. Oh, we don't give up so easily. We're going to get out of here... and the first thing we're going to do is... I'm going to have a look up here. Yes, I'm with you, of course, but... what happen when we get down to the ground? We make our way back to my spaceship. Your spaceship? Huh, is it serviceable? I certainly hope so! But I thought...! You see, I assumed you'd crashed. You coming, Doctor? Yes, I'm coming, dear boy, I'm coming. Oh, er, tell me, young man, what happens if these Mechonoids see up there? Well, there aren't any. We're allowed to go up anytime for light, exercise. There are no guards. Go on, I'll show you. Splendid. Oh, ah, ah... You see, I told you, no guards. I'll go and tell the girls. Yes, wait a minute, dear boy... Chesterton! Well, be careful! Yes, I see why the... Mechonoids don't mind us coming up here. Doctor, what do you make of this? Oh, it's some... power aerial, I suppose... erh... Doctor, I've got it! We can get down to the ground with this! Yes... yes, if we can break it. Well, there's a junction box over here. Yeah... A few good pulls, this will come away. Come on, let's get the others. Yes, come along, come along! Well? Any chance? Yes, but it's going to be dangerous. What? Do you mean the cable? Yeah, do you think there's enough? Maybe. I thought of trying it myself once. I couldn't have managed it on my own. Hey, wait a minute, where's this leading us? Down to the ground. We climb down... fifteen hundred feet of cable! I'm not very good on heights. Yes, it sounds rather risky. Well, I agree! Look, the cable's strong, it wouldn't break. I think it's the only chance we've got. Well, I don't like it. Look! Where are the space travellers? Zero. Daleks! Well, that settles it! On the roof, quick! Go on! Now, I think we'll leave them something to remember us by, mmm? You will be annihilated! Dispatch a section to the roof area. I obey. Am exterminated! Am exterminated! Argh... argh... argh... arggghhhh Totally immobilised. Trapped... trapped. I think we've fused it. Never mind about that. Let's get on with this. Come along! Quickly! Get that... come on! That's all right. There's plenty_. Help her! We're going to have to lower her. Vicki... Vicki, listen to me. We'll tie the cable round you and lower you to the ground. You'll be quite safe. No! I can't! Vicki, my dear, I'm going to blindfold you... ...and you won't be able to see a thing. You'll be quite safe. Now come along. I can't, no! Pull your self together... Don't! No! Vicki, come along, come along! Quick, lift up your arms... Now hold onto this, Vicki. There, that's it. Please! I can't! It's all right. Please let... I know you'll be safe. All right? Come along... Hold on to this. Good gracious! The place is on fire! But Hi-fi! I've got to get the mascot! No, Steven! Steven, what are you doing?! Get hold of her! What are you doing! Come back! Follow... Mechonoid... attack... system. To defy Daleks is death! We await commands! The operation will proceed at once. Defend... threat. They must be destroyed. Escalate... output. Exterminate them! Exterminate! Attack... here. Annihilate! Fire. Vicki! Vicki, are you all right? Yes... yes thanks. How about the others? They're fine. Now Vicki, remember the Doctor's device? Well it worked! The city's on fire. Look, you can see! Vicki, my child, are you all right, Mmm? Yes, yes thanks. Come along, let's get back to the TARDIS. Well, what about Steven? Where is he? Steven... went back to the city. We don't know, my child and his chances of survival in this furnace are utterly... Quick! That cable's on fire! The whole buildings collapsing! No, we can't! Halt! You will be exterminated! Exterminated! Oh, Ian! Doctor, it's empty! You've done it again! You've beaten them! My dear boy, I could kiss you! Don't waste it on him, kiss me instead! Oh _ delighted! You know this must be an extremely advanced machine. Yes. Wherever we went, it followed us with... such great precision and accuracy. You could travel anywhere in it. It's huge inside, you know. Just like the TARDIS. Of course, my dear, I've forgotten you've taken a trip in it. Er, shall I show you round? My dear, I shall be delighted! After you! Ian... do you realise... we could get home? Home... yes. Do you want to? Yes... I... I never realised it before. Neither did I. We may never get another chance. Do you think we could work it? Well, would the Doctor take us? Let's ask him. Doctor! I don't want to know! _. I want none of this! _ common sense! I've never heard such nonsense in my life! You will end up as a couple of burnt cinders flying around in pa... in space. You idiots! You are absolute idiots! We are not idiots! We want to go home! Yes home! I want to sit in a pub and drink a pint of beer again! I... I want to walk in a park and watch a cricket match. Above all, I want to... belong somewhere, do something instead of this aimless drifting around in space. Aimless?! I've tried for two years to get you both home! Well, you haven't been very successful, have you? How dare you, young man. How dare you sir! I didn't even invite you into the ship in the first place. You both thrust yourselves upon me! Oh, Doctor, stop it! Oh, for heavens sake, I've never heard such nonsense! Look, I know we thrust ourselves upon you but we've through a great deal together since then. And all we've been through will remain with us always. It'll probably be the most exciting part of my life. Look Doctor, we're different people... and now we have a chance to go home. We want to take that chance. Will you help us... work that machine? No! No! I will not aid and abet suicide. Oh, he's as stubborn as a mule! Doctor... Doctor, you've got to let them go if they want to. They want to be back in their own time. Don't you want to go with them, child, mm? What for? What would I want to be back in their time for? I want to be with you. Doctor, you've got to help them. Don't you realise, child, the enormous risks? But it's up to them. Do you both realise the enormous risks? We do. We still want to go. Please, Doctor. Very well, follow me. But you must follow my instructions implicitly, understood? Implicitly! You will both have about a fifty-fifty chance. Follow me, come along. Barbara! We made it! I don't believe it! London 1965! Hey, we're two years out. Oh, what's two years amongst friends? We're home! I'll just go and press that button. Run! Well, that's out paid to the Daleks time travelling for a while. It'll give the Doctor a breather anyway. Yes. I wonder where he is right now? Hey, Doctor, wherever you are... Shh! There's someone coming. Goodbye, Doctor! Thanks for the ride! It was fun Doctor! Goodbye! Ah... oh, I enjoyed that! Yes! So did I. Oh, it's great to be back. Nothing seems to have changed. Oh, you wait 'til we get back to Coal Hill Sc... Hey! How are we going to explain our absence? Yeah... that's a point, isn't it? We'll have to think of something. It had better be good, eh? Oh, er, two three's please. Two three's? You must be joking. Where've you been? On the Moon? Er, no, but you're getting warm! Shh! Doctor, they made it! They made it! I shall miss them. Yes, I shall miss them. Silly old fusspots. Come along, my dear, it's time we were off.
