- And I said, "What does painting mean to you?" And he said, "Painting is the most intimate act of war." - Many of my friends were in the military. I had joined from Holland and was sent, almost immediately, to basic training in March to report to Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, and then immediately was sent to Iraq, Saudi Arabia after that. So I had very little time to sort of adjust. I was there, from there I went to Fort Bragg, and with Fort Bragg we went directly, were sent directly over directly 'cause the conflict had already started. - I think, of course, his military past, you very often see in almost all of his paintings, especially in the urban paintings, but also in the Faceless Series. He's a very serious person. As I said, a very caring person. He is very interested in today's political, economic, environmental subjects and that, in my opinion, you see in all his works. - I saw the damage that we did. Those are things that you don't forget and I'm sure, well, I'm not sure, but I don't know how much my military experience or what I experienced there, or even afterwards, influenced my work now, but I'm certain that it had some kind of impact on me. There was a sense of hyper-alertness that happened during that time. When you're in an environment that's dangerous, there's an automatic hyper-alertness that you're in instinctive mode, much more than a rational mode. - One of my favorite things that I've seen, it's not the, it's very naive, it's not the best graffiti I've ever seen, but I love the message and it's a girl called Shamsia Hassanni, she's an Afghan girl, she's 25 years old, lives in Kabul. She's a lecturer at the university which shows how fucked up it is when you have a 25 year old lecturer 'cause there's no one else left. But she's gone out and she's painting, it's a girl in a blue burka that she paints. And she paints it all over Kabul. And you look at it and you go that is one of the most politically charged images that you could possibly have. It means one thing in the west, means another thing in the east. She's going out, she's puttin' this thing out. She's putting her life on the line every time she does it. - I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder when I came back, and that probably had an impact too in terms of the direction I took and also being critical about what was going on. - Those kind of things, that's what gets me excited when people are trying to use the medium to say something. Like I said, I don't mind people doing purely decorative stuff, but I do like the stuff that has a message in it and I think, you know, the general public also like it. Again, to use Banksy as an example, his is a very naive political message. As his girlfriend used to say, it's like sick foreign politics. But it was something that resonated right away, across the board; people liked the message. Same with JR, same with Marcus. If you look around, you'll probably find a handful, they're actually trying to say something on a political level. I think, again, I think a lot of the artists are put off by their galleries for doing something that has too much of an edge to it 'cause it's slightly harder to sell. - Everything in life somehow plays a part in terms of decisions you make later. I think all of it sort of came together in the arts because it allowed me to explore that and it gave me maybe some of the, some of the motive on why I was doing what I was doing. And I think that's probably one of the things that brought my sort of awareness about being or using your instincts for your benefit, which again, like I said before, we don't really use as much in a civilized society because we're constantly following orders and rules. So maybe it's that that sort of ignited that whole idea. And obviously some of it worked its way into my work in terms of looking at that information and that experience as critical. - And I suppose that's the other thing that separates Marcus, in a sense, from the previous generations of abstract expressionists, because painting is something which really hangs on in American art production because of New York and because of the way that New York took over from Paris, and the influence of it in a way I don't think it really hangs on in other cultures. And I think that my first impressions of his work were, they were unweighted, in a sense, and I say that there was a lot of iconography, a lot of popular iconography involved in it; the Dorothy characters, but also there's McDonald characters, things like that, the prevalence of a certain grammar of symbols which exist in the work, these targets which reappear, the use of found material which become symbolic material to a certain degree. And I think that the emphasis for the gallery owner was a sense on the more saleable pieces which would be the wall-based works. So paintings are much easier to sell than installations. - That's the pleasure we have of looking at art, is that it's the one free aspect that we have that's not touchable. - In some ways, seeing like the way he works in the studio, it's a lot of shop talk kind of stuff how things are and I picked up that he's somebody that's been in the trenches doing what he does, and it's kind of nice because there's murals on the trench walls, he's honing in and he's focusing on the nature of the materials and the way that they're speaking to him. - I'm much more interested in what I feel about a subject than what I see in a subject. It's the feeling that I get that interests me. That's what we want to convey. Instinctive feeling. - And he's working on mastering the way they speak to him. - You never know when you're done. You just stop in a moment of time, you know. Any painting can continue, it's just a matter of, a painting is simply capturing a moment in time. You can always continue a painting 'cause you can always go over it or, you know, find a way to sort of continue it. It's a matter of capturing one moment of many moments that you already experienced in the process of painting, in the process of putting it together. - This knowing other painters, how they deal with the chaos and the confusion and then finding the answers in the confusion, I like that he works, he talks about, "I don't know, I just get into it "and then it kind of comes into being," rather than controlling it to be exactly and which is like a Rauschenbergian thing. Bob would say, "If I know what it looks like, why do it?" - The work of his that I was really fascinated with, the first work I was fascinated with, was something called Rock-a-bye Baby and it's a floor-based work, basically. It could be hung on a wall, if you had a lot of anchors. But it's a floor-based work which has a small figure of a black baby in the middle of it with no painted on its forehead and a landscape around it which is basically with found studio material, and then things like jigsaw puzzle pieces, a lot of brushes, other things. And discussing this with Marcus I thought was very interesting because there is a very fascinating discourse in, you consider art history or art theory that was mainly pioneered by WJT Mitchell, who's a critic out of Chicago, and it's basically talking about colonial ideas of landscape and how landscape, as a genre, can also be considered a medium, in other words, it's a medium to convey power or a medium to communicate power. And usually you're thinking of Gainsborough when you think of this, you're thinking of these English landscapes from base of the 18th century, where you start having an empire, in which you have the landowner and maybe the landowner's wife with this perfect, idyllic setting, which they, in a sense, are the purveyors of. They're evidencing their wealth. And you can go on to people who did landscapes of India for an entire career, but they spent one day in India and India looks a lot like Dorset for the rest of their career, but it's supposed to be India. So, this way in which visuality and power or knowledge that that visuality represented and power became part of the imperial visual culture. - I, for myself, generally reject any labels for art as much as I reject them for human beings. I mean, they don't define anything. They give people maybe guidelines in a certain direction and not necessarily always the right direction, it's simply a label. So then once you have a label, of course, you have individual interpretations of what that label means. Labels are very dangerous to an extent, so I generally reject them, but, obviously, for historic purposes and marketing purposes and business purposes, you have labels used to be able to communicate. But I personally, plus I think my work shifts all the time. It's a process in the making, so I can't really, I can't really say that it's in any way particular, it's not static. - And to me, one of the things that was fascinating about Marcus' practice was how his work, in these installations, specifically worked against that grain, without even being completely conscious of it. So, the unconscious ability to harness this relationship to landscape in a way that was both sculptural and also subaltern, for lack of a better word, both from his perspective and for, for a way of subverting the language of landscape. So that work, when I spoke to him about it, he was saying, "Well, when I was in Iraq, "flying over these devastated landscapes, "this is what I thought. "This is what it looks like to me. "It looks like a jumbled mess." - Once again, going back to World War II and the use of bombers, that you hear the sounds coming, on the ground the people have this very real experience of being devastated, but the bombers in the sky are completely removed, and I think when you look at his aerial paintings, you can have both of those experiences. So, from a distance, it just becomes a landscape, a gridded design, much like a bomber or a drone, a navigator would see, but as you approach the painting and you get within inches of it, you see all of those detailed relationships between the land, the people, the animals. And so now you're immersed in it. - In that sense, reproducing that landscape with this kind of victimized child, infantile figure who is calling out against the violence around him, and doing it in such a way where the figure has absolutely no power. This is not a landowner with a huge estate, this is not, there is now power over this situation. The powerlessness of it, the chaotic, inscrutable nature of the landscape that's produced, to me was incredibly powerful as a visual message. So, that's where we started. - Oh absolutely, the point of the process where I say, you know, let's go, is when I get a certain feeling that I've, I'm experiencing something, I'm feeling something. There has to be a sense of, the images talk to you, and once they talk to you, it's a matter of sort of serving as a vessel to kind of investigate what's being said and how you can continue that dialog. - In seeing a number of exhibitions throughout the world, I've become familiar with a movement called Neue Sachlichkeit which is a German movement that happened between the wars. So it happened after World War I and extended past World War II. And neue sachlichkeit means new objectivity, and what those artists were doing, they were looking around them and see the ravages of war. So Otto Dix, George Grosz, Rudolf Schlichter, a few of them had actually been in World War I and were horrified by what they did, what they saw, and felt this need to show the world, from a first-hand basis, what was happening. And I think they were also coming out of a surrealistic movement, Dada, and when I look at Marcus' work I can't help but reflect on his role of today in the same way that those artists were engaging society a hundred years ago. - You know, I guess what partially drives me is simply to get some kind of sense of truth. What I notice in the art world, over I would say the last decade, since I've been painting, there's very little truth and there's very little things being said. There's a lot of, you know, there's decorative elements, experimental elements, but there are no stories being told, at least not in American art. And there was a lack of that, and I thought that was something for me to engage in and it was something natural to me because it was part of who I was. So, the story-telling aspect of it was, it wasn't something I had to work for, it was very natural for me based on my own experiences, based on needing some kind of journalistic commentary in this century, which I think is lacking. We have a lot of propaganda, but there's not too much documentation. So I wanted to be a part of that. As an artist, I think that's part of our responsibility. - Everyday. - Everyday? - I been out here every day since I would say 1999. - Wow. - 1999. But on and off, on and off. - Ya, I'm amazed and yet I'm not amazed. We had a good time there, I mean, it was, you know. - And then he moved. - I remember him, I remember him. - And I remember, ya, we used to, I used to take the train from the Bronx and set up on Prince Street, and my good friend, Carlos Ramsey, used to hold my spot for me and we used to set up the paintings right against the wall. Was a painting called Harlem Deli that I painted and it was a painting on cardboard at the time, and actually I had it in New York and I was showing it on Prince Street and Broadway until John Ortiz came by, who was an actor that played in Carlito's Way, and he was doing a film in New York and he bought the painting, I think for $350 at the time. So, that was the beginning of that. - I was like pitching right around the corner, and even though I was interested in art, it was more like a lot of artists where like they had their little lofts out here with their art and he had, that guy Hamilton that did The Shadows, SAMO which is Michel Basquiat, Michel-Jean Basquiat, SAMO, he would tag up with all this reading and expression. You got Kenny Shaw, Keith Harring, Lee Quinones. A lot of those guys, they started their careers out here. - Of course, you always read something about the painter, some compared him now as the modern Keith Harring. I think he has nothing of Keith Harring in his paintings. - It was a very different scene back then and everybody was sort of involved in it. It was just one of those things that you were able to make something out of nothing and that appealed to me, and that also drove me to kind of investigate it more. - When I was in New York, it was the time of Basquiat, Warhol, so, a lot of things going on in New York at that point of time. - We had a good time. It was a good time just, just being free. - Back then, all this was all industrial, all factories. In fact, we used garment factories. Old garment factories. A lot of hard working, you know, people from overseas. - I started writin' graffiti, I was about 10 years old, in the Bronx. And then my mother used to live in the Lower East Side so I used to come over there and check out the music, that was when punk rock started coming out. - Right. - And when I was filmin' the Bronx, hip-hop was coming out, so I saw both of them blow up. I saw punk rock blow up and I saw hip-hop blow up. - It's like in the old days but like kinda before the internet, you know, when you used to listen to the radio and suddenly a tune would come out of nowhere and would be massive, and it wasn't on one of the major labels, it wasn't on anywhere, it was just some kids in a bedroom that put a tune out. It went out on radio and it was wildly popular and everyone loved it. I akin this movement to those records. Ya, it was kids doin' it for themselves, puttin' out their own stuff, no major label backing, and wow, look at that, thew general public love it. - As a kid, I grew up in a very strong hip-hop culture, the 1980s because that was just the dominant culture. And I remember even when I went to Germany, of course, it took over, the roots of hip-hop culture which people sometimes forget wasn't a whole bunch of entertainment and profanity, but it was about speaking of the issues in the inner city. And, you know, of course, the new generation doesn't really know it because it just, it hardly exists anymore. But it was rooted in a generation that was rebellious and rightfully rebellious because the conditions weren't the best conditions. - I was a graffiti artist in the '80s, painted subways. I started a brand called PNB Nation which was kinda the first experiment of graffiti artists going into commerce. It's like one of the first times that like we started to communicate, you know, not on trains, but sort of via messaging on I-shirts and sort of creating graphic language that people could wear. - In 1982 I was in New York and I had met West One, who was introduced to me by my godmother who was actually his mother's best friend. And he lived in midtown Manhattan. The two of us got together. He was sort of, and still is, considered one of the graffiti legends, a few years older than me. He inspired me. I saw his work and was introduced to him. His room was a room full of spray paint cans and all kinds of graffiti tags on the walls and everything. That impressed me. I think everybody sort of has a spark in their life that kind of gets them to do things. It was one of mine back then. - Used to DJ, ya, I couldn't hold a spray can. It's too big for my hand. Used to hold it like that to spray it. Used to get more paint on me. - I was flippin' through The Source magazine, which is a hip-hop magazine, very legendary hip-hop magazine, and when I got to the back of the magazine, in the ad section, there was an ad that Jansen had taken out, and it was this really historic, classic piece titled Subway 82. It was a silhouetted figure of a man kneeling down inside of a train that was graffitied up. And I saw that piece and I was absolutely blown away. And I said whoever this artist is, I need to meet them, I need to know who they are, I need to speak to them. So I reached out to him and it developed a relationship between him and I. I purchased some of his work and became really good friends with him, eventually went on to work with him, and here we are 14 plus years later and him and I are really still in each other's life. - See, I don't think it should be classified as urban art, I think, again, it's one of those things where, I think this was the real art world trying to ghetto-ize a movement that it didn't understand. So it's like, well, let's just push it over there, that's the children's area, let's put one of the small table over there with the little chairs while we dine at the table over here. We don't want them near us, they need to be over there. I think, if anything, it was the art world's way of kinda saying it's not a real movement, it stays over there. And then as the years have gone by it's become a more and more powerful movement. - It became a movement. Ya, I think, you know, we weren't the first but we were one of the first, probably maybe handful of people who, it was more of like a youth culture explosion, youth culture movement. It happened to be manifesting in the form of like small I-shirt brands. But, it was really a kind of dialog that became national. There were west coast brands and east coast brands. But ya, also for us we were very sort of, it was more of a social commentary. We considered ourselves like the social critics. - What graffiti inspired? Ya, you'd think it'd just be a mark. There's a kid on Broadway but I don't know what to call his graffiti. - An amateur. - Amateur? - He tries his best, but he doesn't have the experience. - I'm not sure that's necessarily a good thing, 25 years old and seeing the proliferation of shit graffiti all over the world. From wherever you go, from Baghdad to Birmingham, there's a ton of rubbish out there, but there's also some great stuff out there still. - And people try to use that gambit by taking a graffiti artist and turning them into some kind of museum art or whatever it is, and they keep trying to manufacture the new Basquiat or the new Keith Harring by taking a street artist or a graffiti artist and showing them in a gallery setting. And some of that has worked really well. Some of that hasn't worked at all. But the overriding point is that I think Keith Harring is a valid, you could say Keith Harring is that gambit, so to speak. Basquiat happened to be painting his SAMO sayings on walls, but wasn't really a graffiti artist in the same sense that Keith Harring seemed to be a graffiti artist. - Depends on who you're talking to. From what I gather of personal friends with Jean-Michel is that he disliked being called a graffiti artist. And in his situation, he was going for something that, and people were trying to tear him down socially. - Ya, they did it with Banksy as well. This isn't real art, this isn't made properly. This will never last. The movement's finished. We'd sell a painting for like 20 grand, and people would go, "This is just not gonna last, "it's not possible." Oh, I just sold another five. Or, you know, "You can't do exhibitions like that." I said well, we just did and we got like 40,000 people come by. So, what is there about this that you can't do? And it's just, I think, they don't like change. They go to college, they study art history, art theory, there's a certain way of doing it, it needs to be done like this and needs to be shown like this. Your gallery has to have white walls and a polished concrete floor, and a really annoying German girl on the desk that doesn't smile and makes everything feel like shit when they come in. You know, I think, the whole thing, they don't like it 'cause they don't understand it and the main reason they don't like it is because it's populist. And my thing is is sometimes there's a reason things are populist, not because it's overly commercial but because lots of people like it. - I just think that the motives behind the promotion of certain kinds of painting can be very transparent in the New York art world. So, when I saw Marcus Jansen's work, it wasn't work that I had seen in the New York art world at that stage because he's in a different part of America, and he's also showing in England, so it was like more of an international thing. 'Cause a lot of the work in New York is very local. And there's art in New York that never gets international. I got a really, immediately felt that Marcus' work had an international thing happening. - In Germany people are much more braver to express their worries and what they observe. Here, they try to be politically correct and not express it. In Germany, they debate about those things. And it wondered me how Marcus put his finger into the wound of the things which are obviously out there. - I think that the popularity, in terms of my work, changes depending on the general awareness of the population. And I can say that because, I mean, I've been doing this for almost 20 years, and I would say for the last 15 years kind of more, in a more critical direction. But my popularity is just really now, has been getting more attention. So that hasn't been the work, that's been a change in the consciousness and awareness of the population, I think. So I'd like to think that as I continue to do that, that that can always shift whether it's in Europe and so forth. I would say Europeans, generally speaking, from my experience, living there for almost half of my life, there's more critical debate, open critical debate, there's no question about that. Where here, discussions, generally speaking, unless you're around a certain group that is specifically sort of tasked for it, there's more of sort of entertainment discussions in general. So there's a difference there, culturally. And this is a cultural difference that just exists. So, in terms of the audience drifting towards my work, that, like I said, it largely depends on what's happening in what country, and when. - Well, you know, one of the things I noticed about Marcus, like the time he spent in Germany, I've done 12 shows around the world and stuff and it seems that the European attitude about the arts is there's more of a reverence for the arts and there's more of a care about the arts. American public, to entice people to go to the museums to look at stuff is like this rock star game. - Look, I remember a few years ago I was in Paris and a friend of mine, we went to visit a friend who was squatting in a building with 30 other artists and they were squatting, and I said, "What's happening here?" And he said here in France, if a building is not being leased or sold, you're required to allow artists to live in that space. So they, institutionally, there's an understanding, there's no shame to be in a room and say, "What do you do for a living?" I'm an artist, I'm a painter, I'm a sculptor is like you can be saying I'm a doctor, I'm a lawyer, I'm an accountant. Where as here, it's sort of like, "You're an artist?" Okay. You couldn't do anything else, so, you know, it's sort of not as valued. - It seems that the cultures have looked to the arts for understanding life more in the European consciousness, and there's more of why we're here-ness, there's more of a collecting because we need to collect it than there is in America. America, there's a lot of the 1% that just gets stuff because that's what we should be doing. Like the Flemish masters, a lot of Flemish masters happened at a certain period because at that time, the common people that it was really important to have a painting, and they would spend a year's of income to have a painting in their house, not because it was status, but because this is so special, we really need this. - I remember once touring in Paris and they were showing us this huge monument, it was made of metal and these beautiful carvings. It's famous, I forget the name of it, but Napoleon had it made. But the metal for the object was melted down Prussian canons that he had brought from the Prussian battlefields back to France to be made into a piece of art and to me that kind of sums up their whole deal about art. It's like, we took, we are going to have hundreds of men take these canons back to France, symbolically, and create them into a work of art and that's gonna be what stands in our city and I kind of feel like that's cool. - You know, if artists were to go on strike and were striking, who would give a rats ass in America? They don't need to do that. What's that good for? That, Marcus has the drive that he has to do this and we should learn from this, and we should know why it matters. - No, no, I think it's in both, if I can compare, the Americans take a lot of care or are very, very much interested in art, so is the German, so are the German people. - You know, you have this seminal Subway Art book come up, which at the time, I think still, it's the most stolen book in British history 'cause people just go in and nick the books. Ya, we were very aware of what was going on in the States. I don't think we were so aware, I think, it was only later years I started realizing how old the movement was in the States, 'cause everyone thinks it started in the '80s, but really, it started in the '60s. There's a great book that was made in 1974 called The Faith of Graffiti that was, one of the authors was Jon Naar and Norman Mailer had written a 12-page essay to go in this book, so it was already powerful enough as a movement in 1974 for Norman Mailer to have written an article about it. I think people forget this and it always makes me laugh when you're doing interviews with journalists and it's like this new movement. It's like, it's kinda been around for like 50, 60 years. It's not a new movement. Well, you know, these new superstars, and you're like you kinda have Basquiat and Keith Harring. They can create well, really. And people always say they've been written out of history, really, it's been graffiti artists, their fine art, contemporary artists are not ever really associated with graffiti. So, ya, it's been around for a while. - New York is a complicated art scene to talk about because it's not, as a society, the New York art world is not a just society. Whereas, a lot of other places you go, things happen for, more or less, rational reasons. But I find that in New York, there's a lot of nepotism, there's a lot of monetary factors that come into play, there's factors of international publicity. So it's like, you have, all of the media is in New York, a lot of the big-money collectors are in New York. - And I'm gonna start the bidding here at 57 million dollars, at 68, for 98 million dollars. - Final bid's at 107. Anybody else? At 107 million dollars then. - And so you bring all of that together and it creates kind of a beast, more or less. - Ya, the Faceless Series, they emerged in, I think 2011 or '12 is when I started painting them. And it was right around the time politically when, you know, the majority of people found out about Wall Street and had attention on the Federal Reserve and so forth, and I thought, you know, like who are these people. Who are the people that make decisions nowadays? Are they the people that we see on TV or are they the people that we don't see on TV? And that interested me. And I wanted to investigate that, and by investigating that, I simply started with people that were faceless. And I thought that'd be a good beginning because it allows me, without input of any kind of facial gesture or implication of ethnic grouping or gender or anything, to start there. It sort of continued as a series, and they stayed faceless, and they're almost, they're characteristic, even though they don't have a face. You get a sense of that they're somebody of some authority. - It is spontaneous, it is performative to some extent. It retains compositional effects, but most of the impetus of it, most of the energy is this kind of interior subjectivity, which is either ruined or libidinal or an expression of some kind of interior angst. His angst is very exteriorized, if you want to put it that way. What I mean by that is he has a purpose in the way that he is painting. He's not angry for himself, he doesn't have some personalized agenda insofar as what the painting is supposed to do. - Ya, and I can't blame 'em. You can't, I mean, you know, showing a painting and then explaining a painting to somebody that speaks English like you, giving it an explanation, an additional explanation is like adding French to it, it makes no sense. The painting is a vocabulary, it is a language. You just have to take some time and study it. - It is meant to communicate a reflection of injustices in the world per se. So, questions of the society of surveillance, how do you respond to that? How do you look at this programmation of the individual in a work like Resistance, or he has Cyber Surveillance in the Wasteland, these are really commentaries about the relationship of media culture and media saturation to the way that subjectivity is formed, the way that media can stand in for propaganda, the way that constant surveillance, this kind of post-Orwellian moment affects the subjectivity of the next generation, things like this. These are the purposes, the real concerns of his work, and even though he works in such a way where he doesn't have a plan in terms of what he's doing, it is very instinctual, and there are some other kind of surrealist aspects of it which you would consider unconscious. It's trying to bring the unconscious effects of society to the level of a visual consciousness, which is very different than the solipsistic, narcissistic kind of version of a previous generation or a focus, if you wanna be kinder about it, a focus on the individual so strictly that it is about their personal struggles; these are about social struggles. - Some of his scenes are somewhat like desolate, seem like sort of a war zone imagery mixed with sort of architectural aspects. I did some writing about Marcus' work and I had a chance to really, really get into it. You can see the political overtones, but his work isn't necessarily, like squarely politically based commentary for me. - Bob was adamant about don't try to explain. There was stuff that I was privy to like special gifts that Bob had given me that I understand what it means, from him to me. - Robert Rauschenberg, blue, to Marcus. This was a gift, a precious gift I got from Lawrence Voytek who was Robert Rauschenberg's long-time art director. These are the actual oils that Robert Rauschenberg used. I haven't used them yet. I might use them for my Blue period one day. - And I think that we have to deal with all sorts of things and I think that dealing with the various, the good, the bad, the sad is something that, this is the way that he deals with what's going on in this life, this wet dirtball spinning in space with stuff all around, and what we're sold and what's crammed down our throats and what others do, what we believe, we have to be in charge of our own church. - But, you know, they've all used it. If you look at the propaganda, I wanted to do a show and I still do called The Art of Despotic Leaders, but then there were so many of 'em it was hard to work out where it was. Where do you draw the line? Does it have to have you've killed at least a million of your own people or you go from Saddam Hussein, Idi Amin, Chairman Mao, Stalin, Lenin, all these guys that used their image and art as a way of terrifying the masses. Look at Saddam. You had like 50 meter high statues, you have posters, it's like we're watching you. You can turn off the radio, you can switch off the television, but at some point you have to go outside and these guys, they've got it down in a way of kind of terrifying the masses with it. But you're right, the American government does the same thing for Coca Cola advertising. And Pepsi. - New York City in the 1970s, as you know, was almost bankrupt. They were about to close down, that's how bad it was. Out of that, you had Vietnam veterans coming back, people homeless, the Bronx looked like a war zone. We lived in the Bronx in the 1970s and the later moved to Long Island because it was just not a place you wanted to stay. My father hated it. - It must have been an artist's observation. I took him one afternoon after we finished a walk into a bar with dim lights. And I only took my wife and children to bars that were proper, and this was certainly proper, but it was a bar, in New York. And while he was having his drink he was looking at a picture of a nude in dim lighting, very tastefully done. And I was wondering what he was thinking about this and asked him, "Marc, what do you see there?" And he said, "Daddy, this is a woman afraid of thunder." - It was just an environment that almost cultivated somebody to speak and say something and it happened in the form of hip-hop music and graffiti art and so forth. And I just happened to be part of that generation that was engulfed in that. And then took some of that to Europe, where, of course, it just took over that whole place too. - I have one which is actually talking to me very much because it's part of my country. Like I just said, we had a divided country, divided through a wall. We had the German Democratic Republic and I have a painting from Marcus which is called Stazi. And I think you know what Stazi was, so there's a big relation to all those things. Ya. - The people, I think, gravitated towards the message of it. It wasn't so much a question of amusement or anything, it was really more the message that was being delivered that there was something wrong in those environments and that people wanted to be heard. Tags had to do with the fact that people noticed you. It was about getting your tag, I'm here, I'm important. I'm not just somebody living in some bombed out area, but it's important that I'm here. And that changed the culture of art even till today. - He is a very caring, responsible person. The environment is a big subject of his which you see in his paintings. - Leonardo da Vinci, in his notebooks at one point, described mildew on a wall and he could see horses charging. And so, it's the abstracts seeing things in stuff. - A lot of the guys that got pushed out and lived here, raised their families out here, eventually were pushed out. Those are people I feel bad for. - I think it really comes out to access and exposure, and to also see people that are similar to who you are. They may look like you, come from the similar communities and neighborhoods and backgrounds, and that that inspires you. So, when a young person comes into the gallery and I tell them that I own the gallery, now that becomes a possibility for them. Or they see a particular artist, such as Jansen, and that work is relatable to them and I tell them that he's a successful artist, then now they say wow, I can create art that tells my story. - I think the street nowadays has become, it's become a medium rather than a movement of art. I think you've got a lot of artists that are at college that like work or paint on canvas or can make a sculpture or could use the street. So I think the street's now become a bigger canvas than it ever was before. - I couldn't compare him to anybody alive or dead.
