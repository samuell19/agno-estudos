THAT IS THE DAWN Hey, you there! Don't let him escape! He's here! Hands in the air! Fire! Get cover! Get them! Guys, come on! - It's the new boiler? - Yes. That's 500 bucks lost. Congratulations! Let's go see that. What are they doing? They're waiting for news of their friends. Nice excuse to give up working. Right, Azzopardi? Of course. Come on, send them back to work. Perhaps we shouldn't be too pushy. The boiler was unprotected. An expensive economy! Let's go. Yes. It's for you, sir. Not now. It's from your place, your wife. I'll call back. There was an accident. What? Yes, hello. What are you waiting for? What happened? Please, Angela, try to understand. I must take care of two wounded. Yes, I'll come back immediatly. But you feel better now? Yes, see you later. No, lady, no. Didn't they tell you to not ever touch a burnt wound? Hand me the serum. Quick! One moment. Not on the fingers. You don't want to pay attention, do you? Forgive me, sir. I'm not used to it. I'm not sure you'll ever be. I'll join you later. I'll go see the wounded first. Sure. Doctor, he's collapsing. I'll see to it immediatly. -Hello, doctor. -Hello. Is it serious? Incapacity to work? Numerous weeks. Couldn't you pay more attention? And you, what do you have? Me? Nothing. So why are you here? My co-workers have sent me to get news from the wounded. They're doing very well. No need to stop working for such a little accident. Enough, lady. Aren't you happy with the new nurse, doctor? Very happy. I'm just as happy about the equipement and building. Get me larger ones, and fast! Are you in a bad mood, sir? No, I'm just worried. My wife is ill and waiting for me. Sorry. Well, I won't bother you. -Bye. -Goodbye. Have you been a nurse for long? No, sir, I just got my diploma. It's not a work for you. Why is that? You're too pretty. If it doesn't work with the doctor, come see me. We'll find an agreement. Forgive me, dear. It was the hospital. I'm used to it, you know. The appointments, the visits, the hospital, and the phone. Always the phone. In the end, you don't belong to yourself anymore, nor to me. Calm down, all right. Let's go home, okay? I can't take it anymore. I swear. You're tired because you fainted earlier. Why did you go out in such a heat? You're never home, what should I do? Delphine wont let me touch anything. I've had enough of reading, I'm bored. No, please! Make him stop. I hate this country. Day by day, it takes you away from me. Yes, it does. I know you're doing your best, ...but you have less and less time, and now I'm alone. You're being unfair. I don't want to be fair, I want to be happy. Angela, calm down. I shouldn't have asked you to follow me on this island. I would have followed you anywhere. Nothing has changed. You're a bit depressed, that's all. You should take a break for a while. Oh darling, that would be marvelous. You really want to? Where should we go? We? How's that, "we"? You said we should leave. I meant you, dear. How ould I leave? I wont leave without you. I can't leave everything behind. Come on, we'll take about it later. Listen, I wont leave you alone today, I'll stay with you. Let's go to the restaurant for once, we'll go home afterwards. It would be so easy to stay together. Why wont you come with me? Not right away, but tell me we wont stay here forever. You know that father would be pleased to pay for your moving to Nice. I dont want to owe anything to your father. You took his daughter from him. What's wrong with Nice? There's a clientele for you there. A real one, that pays. You only cure poor guys here. And often for free. The poor. I'm still paid as a doctor. It's not about the money. It's the life that I can't stand. In Nice, we could see people, go out, to the theatre, live finally. I have my father there, childhood friends, acquintances... We'll forget this place. Do you hate it so much? I do. Why don't you want me to be happy? Tell me I can talk with father. Tell me that, when I come back, we'll leave together, forever. They need me so much. Don't you care more about me? Look at me, I exist as well. Enough of this now. Here, it will get better. But he'll have to come back in 8 days. Yet again? But I can't... We'll see to that later, there's no hurry. You'll take him back here, okay? Come here! My pen! That's it. What have you done? No, no, it's alright, it can be fixed. Thank you doctor, you're kind. Come on, quick. You can only make blunders. Come. Goodbye, doctor. Goodbye, madam. Goodbye, doctor. Pietro, what's going on? Not going to the fabric today? Yes, I'm going back. I went to Sandro's place. Magda's not going well. He's worried sick. He asked if you could come by. Of course. I'll go right way, I have no patient now. Just wait a second. Delphine! Yes sir! A souvenir from the Italy campaign. Now, that's excessive. Does it surprise you? It's rather weird. What can it mean to you, you heathen? You don't believe in God, nor in the devil. Sure, but they, they do. You can't understand the beauties of war. -Did you put the new needles? -Yes, sir. -Good, I'll be back in an hour. -Good, sir. So, are you done? Yes, as you can see. Were're changing from construction site. See you later. Bye. I'll see you there? I'd like to, but I have to work. Her disease is serious, right? She's not going to die, is she? Have a little faith in me! It's not that, sir, but those two love eachother so much. I know, pal. Thank you for coming so fast. How is she? She's sleeping now. But I was really scared this morning. Poor guy. No, I don't need that. Is it true that you're leaving? Who told you that? It's very small here, everybody knows everything. Yes, I'm trying. It's because of my wife. But it's hard. I can't find someone to replace me. I'll have to wake up Magda. So, Magda? I didn't want them to call you. It's his fault. He often calls you for nothing. What do you mean, nothing? I'm always pleased to see you two. And Sandro and I have spend some bad years together. That counts. Is your wife well? Yes, thanks, she's doing better. When Sandro told me you were willing to go back to the country, it made me sad, you know, but I'm happy for her, and for you too. Not for us, of course. Thanks, Magda. Don't move now. She could stand up, if I let her. To go dancing? No, to help Sandro. I mean so much trouble for him. He never stops: here, outside... So? It could be long. She will have to rest, in quiet. Yes, this illness is for the wealthy. Someone should come to help you. I don't want anyone. You can't stay alone like this. No-one! We'll talk about it. Now go see her, and try to get some sleep tonight. Goodbye. Come on, go to her. What did he say? Everything's fine, you mustn't exhaust yourself, that's all. But you're the one exhausted. Are you going to work now? I should go. But I'm afraid when you are alone. Afraid of what? Nothing. I'm such a nuisance! But you'll see, soon I'll get up, and we will go away. Away? Where? Why? I dunno. Away. Far. Aren't you happy here? Stupid. I'm happy, because you are here. But I would like to see you smile, as before. Take this. What is it? Nothing, dear. I'll go, and come back. Congratulations. We cannot say that he is working himself dead. Does this domain look like it's being taken care of? Where is he? As I was told. He doesn't leave his place anymore. Don't hurry, friend, I've got plenty of time. Why aren't you working? My wife is very ill. You haven't taken care of the vineyard, you didn't give water to the almond trees today. No. Nor yesterday? Or the day before? Don't lie to me. The pump hasn't been working for at least 3 days. I'll go soon. The trees can die, you don't care. I can't leave my wife alone for long. Take her to the hospital, or have someone come here. I wont pay you for doing nothing. It's a shame that your wife is ill, but I've got nothing to do with that. Beware, if you don't want to loose your job. Okay? It is you who should be taking care of all this. I cannot be everywhere at once, at the property and the factory. Captain, Dr. Valerio is waiting. Thanks, I'm going. Quick. - Don't push me! - Shut up! What's this? I'll expose the facts to you, sir. I have no time for this. Anyway, there's no need to knock him off. I don't like police brutality. - But... - No, nothing. You understood me. I hope I wont have to say it again. Captain... Thanks. - Hello, doctor. How do you do? - I'm tired. It's a hard day. I came right away, though I would have liked to go home. What is it? A dirty story. I will tell you on the way. Is it that hard to find someone to take your place? Yes, it's not a very fun place. You're not the only one who would like to take a break. How is Madam Valerio? A lot better. Is she still in Nice? No, her father took her to the mountains. But I think she will be back soon. She'll be back soon? "She will come home soon and I'll tell her: Everything's ready, everyting's vain. "Look what I've built while you were away. "Look this land that I've bought, and everything around that I own. "Look at the great harvest in the night, all white, with blood stains. "Look what the land has created, and all this beauty that took the place of love." Beautiful, isn't it? Yes. This way. Come. Where does Fosco live? Up there. Such a story, captain. It had to happen, with that dirty old man. He already tried to touch my daughter. He didn't just try with mine. Such a gentle little girl. If I had been there, I would have strangled the pig! Where is he? -Come. -And the girl? Up there, I'll show you. I'm the one who called you, sir. Thanks. Hello. - I will tell you what happened. - Too many people here, please leave. Poor girl. I was sure something was going to happen with that man. I can bring you boile water if you need it. Very well. Please bring it. Mommy! Mommy! I'm here my dear. Don't be afraid, I wont hurt you. Be a nice little girl, and let me take care of you. I don't want to, I don't want to! It's awful, doctor... I beg you... Believe me, everything will be fine. But I'll work better without you being here. I cannot. It's so dreadful. Come on, just wait next door. It wont be long. Come on now. Mommy! Mommy! Don't be afraid, I'm your friend. I always wanted to have a daugter who looks like you. Do you like apples? I have a lot at my home, and even more beautiful ones. No-one was home, ...my wife went to the church, I to the city hall, ...the employees had just left. He was waiting for the right time. That's not true! I wasn't waiting for anything. I don't know how it happened. Of course you did it on purpose, bastard! I would have had him in jail long ago, but my wife disagreed, since he's her father. I don't want to go in jail! And if you're very nice, I'll come everyday, and bring you toys, too. Here, doctor. I had to make the mother leave. She was too saddened by her daughter's tears. But it's over now, she won't cry anymore. We already know each other. It was I, earlier, who put you to bed, and gave you water, right? I'm scared of the man. The doctor? How silly. Am I scared of him? He's a very nice man. I don't want to! Let him take care of you. I'm staying by your side. Mommy, mommy, come! Come on, take this away. Come! You don't want to? You're not going to be a nuisance, are you? I don't want to be taken away. -You really don't want to? -No. Walk! If I weren't holding back... That's anough, he's ours now. Stop. Put him in the car, you wait for me, I'm not done here yet. Captain, wait a minute, I have a couple of things to tell him. Bastard! Come on. Help, help! I don't want to go! It's over now, she'll go to sleep. There wont be any issues? Physically, no. But I'm afraid for her mind. She's not young enough anymore to forget. Can I? Thanks for helping me. I've kept you late. I'm in no hurry. No-one's waiting for me. I bet you belong to her family? Me? Not at all. Do you live around here? Only since a few days. I'm not from around here. That's why I never saw you before. What is it? Is it over? Yes, she's better now. She's sleeping. Can I come in, doctor? No, not right away. Please be quiet. -Captain Fasaro. -Pleased to meet you. Madam Bernardine, right? I never thought I would meet you in such circumstances. I knew your husband well, is death affected me a lot. Thank you. I'll write your testimony myself, just come by tommorrow to sign it. Thank you. -Best regards, Madam. -Sir... Can I be of any help? There's nothing more to do now. I will come back tommorrow. Good night then. Are you leaving? Yes, I'm going. I was pleased to meet you. Me too. -Good night. -Good night. My angel. Can I do something? Let her sleep. I'll be back tommorrow morning. -But it's nothing serious, is it? -No, nothing serious. But please, she needs quiet and calm. She must sleep until I come back. Excuse me. Hush now, hush. I see you know the place well. I've been here for three years, always moving around. But you're not staying long, I gather? I have to stay at my brother in law's place for a short while. After that... After that? I don't know. Nothing holds me here, nothing calls me away either. I hope I'll see you again. Me too. But I must leave you now. -Bye, doctor. -Bye. You know, I didn't expect to meet someone like you here, this night. I'll go see the little one tommorrow morning. Will you be there? Yes. -What does he want? -Please. What do you want? I'd like to talk to the boss. Do you have an appointment? He knows me. So you think you can disturb him just like that? I must talk with him! -Are you ready? -Yes. I'm almost done. It's okay... Some urgent business. This letter couldn't wait. Your business takes you away a lot these days. Business is not easy you know. But I had the feeling that... It gives you some satisfaction too. I don't understand what you mean. I think you understand very well. My dear friend, I will have to remind you of our conventions. Our conventions, as you call them, is to be discrete, ...to respect my self-esteem. Those are the very words you used. So, what do you hold against me? You're often with the new nurse from the fabric. Everybody knows about it. They always make a big fuss, but this girl is of no importance. Yes. What is it? I asked you not to be disturbed this morning. Someone insists to see you, sir. -Well, I can't. Who is it? -He says he's called Sandro. Don't know him. He says he comes for the job at the fabric, as guardian. He says it should be a lot better for his wife. Are you done already? Let him see Azzopardi. He shoudln't have come here. -In the garden again? -We're going, madam. -Watch over him, all right? -Of course, sir. Here, give me a kiss. Wer'e going outside with your mother, to the city. But you, you'll stay here. You'll behave well, all right? Be well, dear. What's this? What happened to you? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? He hurt his finger with a needle. A needle? Have you seen it? It was in the garden, it could have been rusted? Have you not heard of the tetanos? Don't get excited, it's nothing serious. Allow me to disagree with you. Hello. I want to talk with Dr. Valerio. That girl is stupid. We should replace her. Not at all, she's very serious. Hello. He's not here? Just when he's needed... Hello, doctor. -Is it true you're leaving tommorrow? -Yes, I am. But you said you were staying for a while? I had to change my plans. You'll come again soon, I hope? I don't think so. But I thought that... Well, I was so happy to have met you, that... I thought that you, too... Excuse me, doctor. I've got to go. Are you certain you cannot stay for a few days more? I was so much looking forward to seeing you again, get to know you. You know very well it's not possible. Yesterday you didn't know anything, but now you know I'm married, so... Say no more. Don't you want to walk me home again? I really have to go. Clara... What really is not possible... Is that you go away. -Good evening, sir. -Good evening Delphine. I was just going to leave. I told you not to wait for me when I'm coming home late. -Dinner's ready. -Thank you. One has to eat, sir. Since a few days, you've lost your appetite. Perhaps it's because your wife is away. I wont let myself die of hunger, don't be afraid. I don't want your wife to find you in a bad condition. -She'll say I haven't taken care of you. -You do take care of me all right. -Thank you Delphine, good night. -Good night, sir. My love... Clara... I kept you waiting my dear, I'm sorry. It's nothing, but you must be tired though. It was a long day indeed, since this morning I have been waiting for this moment. I'm so glad to be by your side. Perhaps that's because I love you. Perhaps. And it feels like home here. I like this house. I don't know how we could meet, if it wasn't in this place. Come, let's eat now. I almost forgot. I brought you something. Give me my jacket. I found her on the road. Her name is Clara. Such a beauty. I like her a lot. Did you hear it? I'll go. What is it? I'm coming for the doctor. It's an emergency. Tell him it's Pietro calling, on behalf of Sandro. What is it? A friend of yours, Pietro, he's asking for you. Pietro... how does he know I'm here? He's coming on behalf of Sandro. Sandro couldn't know either. Someone must have seen us. It's impossible, we were always very careful. What did you tell him? It took me by surprise so much, I didn't even think about lying. Moreover, he seemed to be very anxious to see you. You did well. I have to go. I'm worried. What could happen? I don't know. I'm afraid. Don't worry. Anyhow, I'll make this clear right away. Pietro. Who told you that I was here? Well I went to your place first. Excuse me. The captain told me that maybe I could find you here. -The police captain? It can't be. -Sure, it was him. -Magda's gotten worse? -Yes. All right, I'm going. You, don't stay here. Bye. Hand me the needle, it has boiled enough now. Will she die? Don't be silly. If I could have had that job as a guardian at the fabric, ...I could have taken care of her, and get her cured. Gorzon refused, don't think about it anymore. But now he's firing me! The bastard! He's sending me way from here. I must leave the house. -In how long? -Right now. I could be replaced at any time. But it's impossible! What will become of me now? What will happen to Magda? If only I had been killed... And to think you're the one who saved me. You should've let me die! Quiet, don't yell like this! I'll talk with Gorzon. I don't want you to beg him on my behalf, he would be too happy. What you must tell him, is that I'll kill him if he doesn't leave us alone! That's what you should tell him! Don't yell like this, idiot! See, I took it back from the war. You must know this well. For once, it could be useful. -Are you crazy, give it to me! -No. What good will it do if you shoot him down? I don't care, I've got nothing to loose. Calm down. Magda will get better, and you will stay here. I'll see Gorzon tommorrow morning. It makes no sense. Just give it to me. No. So? -12,5. -12,5, that's fine. Bring us 3 cups of coffee. Pardon me, doctor. I'm always pleased to see you, as you know. What brings you here? You know that Sandro's wife is very ill? Sandro? Oh, yes. So, what is it about? I saw him yesterday. He told me you fired him. -Azzopardi, what happened? -Well, you know it well sir. Anyway, there surely was a reason. But why do you care for that bum? There's no interest in him. Pardon me, but you misjudge him. He's a heartful man, ...and the idea of losing his wife makes him feel desperate. For nobody. You're a sweet talker, doctor, but I'm still master of my house. If I pay someone to take care of my land, he has to work. If he doesn't, he should leave. Sounds logical, right? Certainly, sir. You see? I'll say it again: his wife is very ill, and can't be moved. What can I do about it? I'm telling you, you shouldn't take this matter so easily. Sandro is... in heavy distress. This could turn wrong. Menaces? For me? Do you hear, Azzopardi? Menaces! An ultimatum! Congratulations, doctor. However, the law is on my side. No, no, it's not a menace, nor an ultimatum. I didn't express myself well. Please understand me, Sandro's desperate because of his wife's illness. He's on the verge of exploding. Furthermore, expulsing him would cause a scandal here. Don't forget that he was seriously injured in '44. Goodbye. Wait a minute. Let's not overreact. We're reasonable people, and I'm not a savage. Reassure your dear ones, I'll see what I can do. We can clear it up, right? Of course we can. Thank you very much, sir. Come on, it's nothing really. It's my pleasure. Pardon me, I know that your time is precious, and my patients are waiting. Goodbye, doctor. I'll see you soon. He's right. This business could do us wrong. -Unfortunately, it's too late. -What? Your orders were clear, so I hurried. The man coming to replace Sandro had left his village this morning. -He'll be here this very evening. -What's done is done. I've lost enough time over this already. Where's that folder? Ah, here. Let's continue. You were saying... Your coffee, sir. Away with this! Well, thanks my friend, bye. Good evening. What does this mean? Come in! How come you're still here? They said I'd find an empty house. I don't like to throw out, but you see, I've got my daughter and the kids. But I thought you weren't coming after all... Wait a moment. What's happening? The new guy. You are you? What are you coming here for? And you, who are you? I come to replace Sandro Galli. Replace me? The doctor told me... That bastard Gorzon surely lied to him! I don't know about it, but I need this job. I was told the house would be empty. -Well, you must go now. -You must be kidding me! Don't yell, someone's ill here. Do you think I'm going to sleep outdoor, until you go out? I won't go. I can't! Just go home and leave us alone! You must be kidding! Don't pick up a fight with someone stronger than you! Stop it! Don't you fight, now! Sandro... -I want to go. -What are you saying... Let us leave, go anywhere. We were too miserable here, and for too long. Let's go, quick. -It will be different somewhere else. -Calm down, Magda. Pietro, tell him to take me away. Maybe she's right. -But where should we go? -Well, I don't know. Wait... At my place, of course! It's very quiet. It's small, but she'll be at peace there. Please accept, I mean it. Yes, you're so gentle, Pietro. At least you understand me. I'd be glad to help, you know. -Will you lend us your wagon? -Yes. Well the mule is pulling it since this morning, perhaps you'll have to help it a little when the road's hard. The three of us will make it. The road to my home is easy. I'm begging you. Well, let's go then. Thank you, madam. Show me the baby. What's the matter? I got this yesterday. I didn't dare to open it, but I just read it. When will she be here? Soon. She'll send me a telegram. I didn't want to think about it, but know... What will we do? I don't want her to be unhappy because of me. Me neither. She needs me. I'm sad for her. She must be handled with care. Of course. For a long time now, she's been asking me to move to Nice. I could accept. You'd come to meet me, there we could see eachother more easily. I'll do as you want. There she wouldn't be lonely anymore, she'd have friends, a life of her own. Little by little, I think she could get used to the idea of seperation. What's going on, my love? It's impossible. I know you, you know you wont be able to lie. You are right. In any case, nothing could tear us appart, nor anyone. No need for me to go, they're all running after them. I think that... I made it fall. Don't worry, they'll catch them. Lie down now. No, wait. Hey, kids, blow in your grandpa's nose, and leave my mule alone. I'll fetch my mother. What you doin here mom, come. Don't you hear me? Hurry. Pietro! Pietro! Poor woman! Look, doctor, we'll wrap her in this. It was my bride's dress. I wore it only once, 50 years ago. Yes, very good. Pietro. Look, we'll wrap her in this dress, I wore it just once, some 50 years ago. Yes, very well. Please leave us. Come, Sandro. Have a sip. Go on, you need it. Bring this to the city hall tommorrow morning as soon as possible. You should talk with him, doctor, he's like a stone, I'm worried. Poor man. I'll never forgive myself for believing Gorzon on this. What could you do? It was too late. She was going to die eventually, right? She was very ill, but you never know. I wish I had been there to stop her. It's just too sad! -What's this? -He's gone! It can't be. It can't be. You'll be cold now. It's not my fault, my little girl. I must get things straight, things shouldn't happen like this. I'll get this straight, Magda. I'll get this straight, Magda. I'll get this straight, Magda. You don't have any idea about where he could be? Sandro? No. I don't know. Perhaps... He's got some family at Riety. I'll go see. Did he have his gun? It's possible. At least it wasn't in the house, I looked for it. He'll do something stupid, we have to find him. Try them, and tell me what you think. I don't know if you'll like them, but I couldn't smoke anything else. Sir Azzopardi, I was looking for you. Here are two photographs. Here's one for you. Sorry, I was mistaken. Here, it's this one It's all right, thank you. What do you come here for? You don't belong here, go away! You've heard him my friend, go home. You? What are you doing here? Who is this man? Make him leave. Go away! You've heard her, my child. Please do as they say. Wait, have him come in my office, we can always find an arrangement. Hello, doctor. It's awful, but it had to happen. I told him, he should have listened to you, but he never listens to anyone. -Where was he shot? -In the stomach. Help me. Careful. Don't let me die. I'm right here, I wont leave you. Doctor... What can we do? Be brave, madam. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for the doctor. Who are you? Sandro. So it's you... Where is the doctor? I don't know. We were looking for you everywhere this afternoon. Don't stay here, you have to rest, I'll have him come for you. I'll wait for him here. Can I help you? -Good evening, doctor. -Good evening. I'll wait for you at 10 A.M. tommorrow at the office. Okay. Good night. Good night. Where have you been? What kept you for so long? Something awful happened. Gorzon was murdered. My God. When? Less than two hours ago, at his home, before his wife. Who killed him? Sandro. Sandro... It's unbelievable. He shot him, and then fled. Nobody knows where he is, but the police is looking for him everywhere. What is it? He's here, in your garden. What? -How did you come here? -I don't know. -Why did you do this, tell me! -I don't know. You're in a desperate situation now. Leve him, please, you can see that he is exhausted. If they find him in your house, you'll be arrested with him. He's crazy. It's impossible, we can't abandon him. Stay here. Don't move, and wait for my return. That's all we needed! What will you do? I don't know, if we let him outside, they'll catch him soon. I can hide him here, the house is big. My dear... I don't want you to have anything to do with this. -But we have to help him. -Yes, yes... It's my fault. Everything's my fault. The other night, I should have taken his gun, kept an eye on him. But now it's too late... He loved Magda so much. It's true. They loved eachother as much as we do. In his place, I might have done the same thing. Wait for me. Where are you going? Sit down. You'll stay here for now. I'll see what I can do for you. Don't open the window... ...and above all keep quiet. Wait for me, I'm coming back. And whatever happens, don't leave this room. Doctor... Please, mother, go to sleep now. Let me see if they haven't messed our things up. Just go, I'll take care of it. It's you, doctor. Just what happened? As soon as I saw the cops, I understood. I'm not surprised that it happened. Just where could he possibly be? They'll look for him everywhere. He's at my place. At your place? You know it's serious, right? If he had come to your place, would you have sent him away? But me, it's not the same. How's that, not the same? When you're a man, there are things you can't do. What a story! I can't believe it. Listen, I came about this. Don't you have a friend who could keep him for a while? He can't stay at my place, my wife could come home any minute. I don't know. Perhaps... Let me see. He's not safe at my place you see. Wait, I have a relative... He's got a little boat... We will pay for the trip. He'll agree to taking Sandro, and bringing him to the country. Do you trust him? As much as myself. Then do everyting you can. Don't worry for the money, if there's a problem I'll pay. I'll see him at down. It should work. But getting Sandro on there... Don't worry about that. Tell your relative he must be ready to leave the coming night, ...he's got all day to get ready. Call me if anything's wrong. Okay. Goodbye, and thanks. -Doctor. -Yes? Why are you doing all this? -Your report is fine. Thank you. So. -Nothing. -Did you go to Marina? We searched all the fisherman's places. -And the fabric? He's got friends there. -The men are taking care of it. Tell Sebastien to get twice as much men on the port. We don't have him yet, but it shouldn't be long now. He hasn't got a chance in a thousand to escape from us. No, thanks. Perhaps he's left the island already. That would be his only chance. But it's not possible. In fact, it's just like he's already caught. I'm sorry to break your hopes. -What do you mean? -Oh come on, doctor. Everybody knows that you were protecting him. He was your friend really. I understand that you worry for him... But the law is the law. Sandro wasn't himself anymore, he reacted in pure despair. I can understand that. Here, this is the report of mister Azzopardi. On behalf of Sandro, you brought menaces of death to Gorzon. Never! Oh, I should write this down. I only told Gorzon about Sandro's desperate state. That's very important, since we'll have to discuss premeditation eventually. If he's caught. Or if he doesn't kill himself first. Poor guy! His wife died, he avenged himself. It's all over for him now. What could he do now? Of course, he may hide for a couple of days more, but then? Captain, here's the warrant, and the mail. Thank you. But are you sure that he's hiding? I'm positive. And the man who's hiding him is in for serious problems. Hiding a criminal is something serious. Do you suspect anyone? Suspicions? We suspect everyone. It's our job to suspect everyone. Yourself, doctor, yourself... We suspect you. Well here's some good news. Madam Valerio is coming back today. I'm pleased for you, doctor. She's coming indeed. Well thanks. I see that you're well informed. You see... Don't be late, the boat will be here at 2 P.M. -Goodbye. -I'll come along. Nice start... Come on, dad, perhaps he hasn't received the telegram. Or maybe he's got better things to do than welcoming is wife after 4 months. Charming! You wait here, I'll get us a cab. Our readers can know that this awful crime wont go unpunished. I never could have thought that I'll never see Gorzon again. I met him several times at Nice. He sure was tough in business, but he wasn't a bad man. Your husband's patient is leaving at last. I apologize. Have you spent all this time with that poor tramp? My friend, I like you a lot, but you don't live in reality. You're a dremaer. Let's talk frankly: that office in Nice is waiting for you. What's your answer? In a way, I'm tempted. I knew it! But I need time to finish my business, to find someone to replace me. We'll find him! But please, why the long face? Happiness and wealth is brought to you on a silver plate, you could smile at least! I'm so happy! What makes you smile like that, Delphine? Seeing you so happy. The mountains did you good! You're reminding me... I brought you something from the mountains. Madam is too nice. -Where's my handbag? -In the next room. Come with me, Delphine. The fact is, Angela is born anew! -Indeed. Sugar? -Yes. I just read it in the paper, you took care of that poor Gorzon. Yes. Nothing could be done. That bastard, Sandro! They should hang him. You don't agree? No, not at all. It seems that the murderers inspire more pity than their victims! And to think that there are people to hide this bum! If he had come here, I would have hide him. Are you mad? It seems you married a Don Quixotte. That's enough! Come on, dear, dad, don't fight now. Think about me. I'm so glad... Don't talk about it anymore, please. Come, we must get my things out of the suitcase. I want to change clothes. Come on, dad. -No hard feelings? -Of course not. Not this way. I forgot to tell you, your room is in front of ours. Thank you. Delphine has washed the curtains. It's all so clean. She's so marvelous, you needn't tell her anything. You know, there's no hurry. You're acting funny. Are you upsest because father came along? But he's doing so much for us. You don't seem to realize. The two of us in Nice. Happiness! -Listen, Angela, I... -No! I won't listen to anything, until you've kissed me. Who's there? I was so anxious to receive a letter from you everyday. Come in. Excuse me. I must talk to you. -Right now? -Yes. What's going on? Just a minute, my dear. There is someone in the last room. That's impossible. Maybe you haven't noticed. I tell you, there is someone! No. Well, let's see then. It's useless. -Let me go. -No! From my arrival I knew that something wasn't right. You've changed. Who are you hiding? -Do you want to know? -Yes, I do. Sandro Galli. Sandro Galli? Gorzon's murderer? Gorzon's murderer. You must be crazy! Why did you do this? That's my business. Oh really? But if they find him here, wont we all be mixed up in this? Did you think about Angela? Have you thought about her, ...being dishonored, and my name put to shame in the press? She was so happy to see you... You'll throw him out immediatly. No. Then I'll do it myself. Hear me. If you don't obey, we wont stay in this house. You'll do as you please. ...Right! I wont send him away. I'll never give him in. Even if the police comes, I'll help him until the end. What is it? Why are you yelling? Your husband's hiding a murderer. What do you say? The man who killed Gorzon. Gorzon, you say? So he's here? He wont send him away. It's impossible. Tell him it's not true. It is true. But why did you do this? Why not throw him out now? He's laughing at you! Even if I ask? You must have a reason. Tell me, I'm begging you. -Talk. -No. It's terrible. So you don't love me anymore? I felt it in your letters. He's never loved you. I always told you so. Anyway, we wont stay in this house any longer. Come now. Do you really want me to go? I understand. I wont insist. I'm leaving, don't you worry. Since you'd rather have a murderer... Come on now, we'll think about what should be done later. Don't cry, my child. -Angela! -That's enough! You're pathetic. I can tell you, you wont see her ever again. You didn't eat anything. I'm not hungry. You should eat anyway. You'll pass out eventually! I can't carry you to the boat. Someone came this afternoon. Yes, my stepfather. Don't worry. Your wife was here? Yes. -Did she leave? -Don't you worry about that. It's my fault. I'm the one who should have left. Are you crazy? Nice way of thanking me! Getting caught after all I've done. I'll save you, wether you like it or not. So the others would be right after all? -But, I... -No, don't say more! And be ready, I'll come back soon. No, doctor. It's not worth it. Are you leaving? Yes, I'm going. Indeed, this is all my stuff. I wont come back, I don't want to be killed. Don't worry, I wont say anything. I loved that poor lady too much for that. Clara! I've seen everything, ...your wife has left. Yes. Because of Sandro. I couldn't even tell her about us. I'm a bit confused. They may arrest me tonight. Don't say that. Clara, if I shouldn't see you again, if we had to part ways, ...I don't know how I could live on without you. Don't say that, you were right. It was the only thing to do. There's nobody, it's locked. I'll jump in. Wait a moment. Come on, you go this way. -The door is locked too. -I'll open it for you. Are you looking for something? No, someone. I told you, doctor. I can't do anything for you now. I have orders. -Do you want to see my warrant? -There's no need for that. Come in. Think for a minute, doctor. If I find what I'm looking for, the situation would be different than if you tell me something. Let's say, for instance... Me? No, I have nothing to say. Come on, let's go. -Open this door! -But it's locked. -Then break it open! I apologize, sir, but I have orders. Yes, it's here. The captain? I'll call him. Captain, someone's calling for you. -For me? -Yes. Hello. Yes, Fasaro speaking. What? You saw him? Right, yes. I'm coming. All apologies, doctor, your friend is not here. He's being chased after in the street. He's surrounded now. He's got a gun with him. If he kills one of ours, then too bad for him. Where is he? Here. He can't move, he's locked in. But he fired earlier. That's what I was afraid of. Too bad for him. Let's go, and fire at will. No, wait! He wont shoot at me. Let me go. All right. Call him. Sandro! Sandro! Doctor... Poor guy, it's pathetic. I'm sorry. Here, captain. Bastard! He did well, keeping the last bullet for himself. Did he kill himself?
