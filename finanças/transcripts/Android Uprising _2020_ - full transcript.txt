The Philadelphia desert is the most dangerous place on Earth. A thousand square miles of wasteland. The machines had used new weapons, not just automatic or biological. They had other effects, too. Howdy, girls. Sergeant. Command says energy signatures have been detected in this quadrant. Affirmative, sergeant. Standard sweep, let's check it out. Initiate scan. One sweep, 30 degree hazmat. Visual? Negative. What about the rest of you? Sound off. - Negative. - Negative. Negative. Alpha, I've got visual on an active drone on your nine. Roger that. Target acquired. I need extraction. And I'll provide it. I can't see 'em. There are at least six out there. Yeah, well, they're all paid up or something, I think. How do you know? They aint pinging the scanner. Yeah, how 'bout the ones off the grid? I'm talking about the ones I can see. Yes, but your signed in as a civilian. What? Resign in with your repossession agent credentials. There isn't a single android shell flagged with late fees within 900 meters. Not on the public network, no but it takes the AI at least two days to push that data out. Us, we can look at the raw logs, honey. Oh wait, it's reconfiguring the UI. Yeah, it's completely different inside the wire. What we doing here, anyway? We should be out there looking for him. We can observe from here just fine. I'm the one here trying to observe. You're drinking coffee. You call that nitro-ponic stuff coffee? You're way too young to remember the real stuff. Chemically it's the same thing. It's molecularly modeled on exactly the same coffee people used to drink. We used to drink great coffee before the ration. Great coffee. Yeah, so go join the resistance then. Or make it rain something that grows coffee beans again. Yeah, I've got my cloud buster right here. You better keep that wrapped up. You know we're not supposed to be carrying. Whatever. Anyway, I'm not drinking this for the taste. I need the jolt. Especially if there isn't a delinquency for blocks. It's the first of the month. There's got to be someone in an android body who hasn't paid their bill. Sometimes it's just quiet. Oh yeah, is the old philosopher gonna enlighten me now? The shells are staying inside. Why is that? Drones don't ever attack during the day? It's not the drones that they're afraid of. What then? It's us they don't want to run into. Yeah, right. People scrape up enough rebs to get out of themselves for a night. But they can't let go once the meters up. It's inefficient. But it pays the bills. If everybody returned their shells on time, we'd be out of work. What do you got? Female shell. I hope she's not a runner. She's headed right into Borom Alley. You got the lockdown? Yeah. Give me. I hope you haven't shorted it. Everything okay? None of your business. You're not going to work like that, are you? Stop harassing me. You know I'm not harassing you. If you could let me go home and... You'll be home in just a jiffy. Not like that. See, I knew you weren't a first time deadbeat. Rides over, sister. Look, I've been in this shell a long time. And you haven't paid up. No, yes. I mean. Time to go for a ride. Look, there are things I've seen. I know things. Oh, I'm sure you've seen plenty. I mean I've seen other shells. Oh, honey. You've all seen different shells but it's time for this one to go to the shop. They do things. That's what they're for. No to us, they do things. In just a moment, you don't have to worry about that. Look, I'm not the problem, though. I'm warning you. You're warning us? Look, I know what it seems like but I'm just a person in a shell. And it's time to go home. In just a moment, you'll wake up in your bed. Next stop, Android Masquerade shop. No, I can't go back. I'm beautiful here. Lieutenant Linus? Hey, kid. I'd salute but I don't think I can raise my arm. Don't try to move. We get the bastard? He's scrap. Good. So, what's up? You were right, of course. This is incredibly bold behavior from the drones. They acted in complete disregard of the negotiated DMZ. Do you think they're planning an incursion? Figuring that out is above my pay grade and I've got a sinking feeling that the AI is no longer satisfied with just two thirds of the continent. They're not gonna rest until we're wiped out. Afraid so. Then screw the truce. We should be taking the fight to them. Well, that's not for me to decide. That's up to the supreme leader to decide. Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, you are going to have to sit things out for awhile. What the hell are you talking about? I'm just a little banged up. Listen, Barbra. Barbra? That can't be good. That drone pierced your armor. It hit your spine. Your spinal cord was severed. Your legs are paralyzed. No. I'm sorry, Barbra. No. If you're compatible then they may be able to replace your legs with a cybernetic implant. I don't want to be a machine. They will implant a chip in your legs and they'll plant another chip in your back that will serve like a second brain. A goddamn cyborg. We're all turning into cyborgs. Pretty soon we'll be no better than the robots that we're fighting. We need you back on your feet again. I need you back in this fight. How soon can that happen? It will be sometime before the test completed. Until then, we're sending you home to recuperate. Home? Oh come on, sir. Put me behind a desk if you have but don't send me home. You need to rest. And that's an order. Call at the door. Tell them to go away. It's Vicky, your sister. Can I come in? Security clarence nine. Guess I can't stop you. You've only been back about a day right? Yeah. It's a little early to contemplate suicide then. Should I give it a week? Okay. Maybe I can come and visit when we don't get into a big debate. Hey, I'm the cripple. You can walk out of here anytime you like. I'm, I'm sorry you're hurt. It's not forever. Are you sure? No. I haven't heard if I'm compatible yet. Well, when I'm not at the factory, I could be here and help you out. I don't need you to be my nurse maid. I'm your sister and you're only friend, it seems like. I want to help you. Thanks, Vicky. I appreciate it. You can smile. No need to throw a parade. Well, as long as you're not gonna shoot yourself anymore. No, I'm not gonna shoot myself. Good. What were you reading? Oh, I don't know, some garbage. God, I am so bored. You should jack in. Like the rest of the mindless masses? Well at least it will take your mind off of your forced vacation for awhile. Vicky, I fight robots for a living. It's kind of hard for virtual reality to compare. No, the new ones, I mean they are so great. They feed off of your own thoughts and they construct the entertaining scenarios that you're looking for. Like, like if you need a little action. Boom, you're in action. If you need a cry, boom, you're in some heart wrenching tragedy. Need a little romance. Let's just say it's very realistic. I'm sure. No, you like totally have to try it. No, thanks. It's really not for me. Maybe what you really need is to get out of this apartment and hit the town. But my bodies not really cooperating right now. Exactly, you need a new body. Uh huh. So let's go get one. Excuse me? They rent them. What the hell are you talking about? You were deployed when they came out. You rent an avatar and you jack into it. It's not exactly the same as having your own body but I mean it's pretty cool. I've worked with androids, I don't like them. No, you've worked with AIs. These are totally different. They're just shells. I don't want to be a robot. You just pilot it. It's no different than the legs that they're making you. It's way damn different. Fine. Just lay there then. Vicky. How much do these things cost? Android Android Masquerade. Android Masquerade. These advertisements may be disabled upon signing up for our premium plan. Android Masquerade. Are you tired of who you are? Are you tired of who you are? Do you long for excitement in your life? We have the widest variety and most up to date and realistic styles of men's and women's bodies for you to choose from. Drop into one of our retail locations to speak with a trained representative. At least she's pretty. You wouldn't think they would design an ugly avatar. I guess not. Okay. The download should start automatically in just a few seconds. Damn. I don't know why I'm so nerv... Ous. Did it work? Barbra? Yes. Are you in there? I guess so. Can you walk? Whoa. They're heavy. Can you stand? You did it. This could take some getting used to. Whoa. That's so weird. I look like hell. You look like you've been killing robots for a living. What you expect? What do you say we go take me out for a test drive? Dancing? Yeah. Dancing. Only uh, I'm a lot shorter than I used to be. I don't know if I'm going to fit into any of my clothes. You can borrow some of mine. What, what's wrong? I didn't think to ask but, I'm not gonna look like a Barbie doll under here, am I? According to the brochure, features realistic detailing and fully functional. Right. Come on. I'm way out of my element here. It's been a long time since I did this. What am I gonna drink? Where did Vicky go? She was just here. Oh God. I guess I'll get her a drink, too. Carlie? We gotta go, there's drones allover the city. We got 40 kilo calories for that last job. You got 40, I got 60. Wait, you get paid more than me? Of course, I'm the job lead. Then why did I have to lug that android shell two and half miles back to Android Masquerade? Because I'm the job lead, that's how it works. Whatever it is, it sucks. You don't look so good. My housing block is right underneath the wall. You'll develop a taste for it. What a combat high? That stuff packs a kick. But it rots on the tongue. You let me worry about that. Well, you take synthetics for the traumatic stress? It's what keeps me alive. What keeps you alive is a fortress wall, an artificial intelligence, and an army of androids to fight off the drones. Scanner picked up another. Where is she? About 1,300 meters. There's some weird interference. No. It's a G series android. G? Oh, it gets even better. Wow, it's a G. Oh, can't begin, runs it right back out, prematurely, op still ongoing. Whatever that means. What? I don't know what that means but they're offering a bonus. How much? 4,500 kilo calories. It's not that much. Per day for six months. Wait, what? Someone could buy their way into a level five shelter for that kind of money. Exactly. Where is this shell? 1,300 meters from here. That's a pretty wide search area. Do a non associate search. Oh yeah, they're all in shells. Wait, here's one. Got a name? Beta, we've got a transponder. Let's find this quib, see where it leads us. We don't have to find her. What do you mean? She will come here. Is that her? Yeah. Why don't we grab her? We could get to the Juliet 17 model with her, if she knows where it is. That aint how repos work. This isn't just a repo, this is detective work. I don't like it. Think 4,500 calories a day and extra rations. For six months. You could buy into a level four shelter with that. Maybe even a level five. Could be. I just don't like dealing with humans. Me neither. That's why I like you as a partner. Yeah, whatever you say. Oh look, she's getting ready to leave. We need a word. You're not cops. What are you, Cent-Com? You got it wrong. I got it wrong, huh? We're not Central Command. So why are you jostling me? We have a problem. Not my problem. It is if we say it is. We need to find a shell. I'm not a shell. But you know the one we need. I don't associate with shells. You'd know that one. A Juliet model. Can't help you. We think you can. I've got places to be. True enough. Okay, so if you're not Cent-Com. We're a class two business, sister resistance, and we got a temporary detain. With your name on it. So, maybe you help us find this shell and we help you run free. Don't turn you over to Cent-Com for an extended stay when the temp-det's over. You don't seem to have an overnight bag with you. Okay. No need for a temp-det. I'll tell you what I know. Don't ever make us run. You look like you could use the exercise. She tried to cut down the alley, ran right into me. Well, let's see if she's any smarter than that starting now. Maybe too steep a learning curve. I'm not telling you anything. Sing this song at our shop. You have to be quick. I'm a temp-det. My shakedown record is seven minutes. Come on. Sit back down, please. Sit back down now. You're wasting this whole temporary detention, you know? I've already been for 10 of the 30 minutes. We still got plenty of time. But we can't waste any. So why don't we just get down to business then, shall we? We know you're resistance. We had them do a scan of everywhere you went. That's what took us so long. You've been having a big old resistance party. And you aint been too discreet about it. Or maybe they like being brazen. Or maybe they're like you, maybe they like the nitro ponic. Well, there's plenty of you on camera. Coming. Going. With the Juliet. Enough to chip you. We may just pack you off to Central. You'll get nothing from me. Absolutely nothing. Wow, April. Phew, your stony resistance really got us defeated. I'm surrendering. Well, you stay here while I check back with central. You know my partner didn't just go and call Central Command, right? Oh, she didn't? She's right outside the door listening. She is? We don't want to send you to Cent-Com, April. You don't? No. All that means is more paperwork. Last thing old cranky pants over there wants is more paperwork. All we really care about is the shell. Getting it back safe and sound. That's it, that's our job. We really don't care about anything else. We'll let you fly out of here scot-free. Just help us out. I couldn't tell. Couldn't tell what? I couldn't tell that she was a shell. I know. Technology's getting better and better. Used to take something the size of your hand to shut down a shell. Now, with the newer models, it's a tiny little fob program, right between the shoulder blades. You'd never see it. Never even know it was there. I've never used a shell. You know what, me neither. That can't be true. It is. Still some of us that believe that being yourself is the very best thing. Me, too. I know. So, tell us about the Juliet and we'll let you out of here. Okay? I was jealous. Jealous of? Her. Okay, see I didn't know that she was a robot. She was beautiful but she wasn't like plastic. She made a pass at my beau. Thought he loved me. Then she came along. There's no way that he knew that she was a shell. He would never date a shell. Where did they go? I don't know. Come on. Okay, he didn't want me to know but I followed them one night. Where did they go? Quad J. Handmaiden Building. Must of been her place. Which makes sense if she was a robot. That's great, April. Just great. Just great. Bad news, sister. Bad cops back. We're done. You're done? But we still have 12 minutes of the temp-det. April and I here have come to a meeting of the minds. You have? We have an address. An address? Quadrant J. Oh, I love Quadrant J. Oh, are you sure it's Quadrant J? That's what she says. Oh, well, April. I'd just love to stick around and chat but we have to get things going. Should we let April go? Oh, I would love to but you know there are some gentlemen from Central Command who are going to escort her home. After a few questions. But you said. You think you can stroll right of here knowing the top of line shells have infiltrated the resistance? I expect there's gonna be a much more demanding sessions with the folks from Central Command. A wash, I expect, to make sure that you're no use of them. Oh, if you're lucky, you may even have a whole new identity afterwards. You lied to me. I told you what normal procedure was. But this isn't a normal procedure. You lied to me. This is what you get for making me run, sister resistance. Sit, catch your breath. I'll let the others know you're here. Carlie? What the hell? What the hell? What's the big idea, disappearing on us like that, you bitch? And you are? Look, Carlie's back. Hey, Carlie. Where'd you find her? Downtown, about to get her head blown off by a drone. Careless. Mother effin Carlie. Let's focus, everyone. I think we might be losing sight of the fact that the city has just been attacked by the AI. Look, who are you people? No sign of head trauma. Where have you been, Carlie? It's been weeks since you disappeared. And what the hell are you wearing? Oh, robot incursion, people. Right. So, the AI is making a move. Does that change anything? Only that it's going to shift more public support behind the supreme leader. His grip is only going to get tighter on the human enclaves. Damn it, that's true. But last time we saw Carlie she was casing the Central Command outpost on 42nd street. That was three months ago. If they made her, TDF goons could have grabbed her. Who knows what they might of done to her mind since then. There's nothing wrong with my mind. My name is Barbra Slade. Sergeant Barbra Slade, Terran Defense Force. This body doesn't belong to me. They really effed her up, all right. Tanner, if they did get into her head, there's not telling what information they have about our operation. Does she know about the strike on Central Command Headquarters? We had been talking about it, yeah. Son of a bitch. That's month of planning down the drain. You're kidding. We can't abort now, we're all set to go. We don't know how much she might of told them. We can't exactly take that chance, can we? Hello, I'm right here. What are you thinking, Tanner? We have to abort, right? Not if we can be absolutely certain she didn't tell them anything. And that's impossible. Not necessarily. What are you talking about? We've got that jack, right? Yeah. Well, what if we were able to jack her in. That's not what a jack is for. Hear me out. The jacks generate virtual reality scenarios based on our thoughts and memories. If we were able to jack her in we could conceivably use the virtual reality environment to trace back where Carlie's been these past few months. Not from the outside. Someone would need to be in there with her steering the story. So I'll jack into the same session. I'm sorry to interrupt but I'd like a vote here. You don't get a vote. You're not jacking me into any virtual cast. No, no. Let me go. Let's do this. This is a terrible idea. This is a huge mistake. This is all a misunderstanding. I'm not Carlie. I'm not Carlie. I'm an android. All set, Hanson. This sure has hell better work. Please make them stop. It's okay, Carlie. We're going to get this figured out. I'm not Carlie. Do it, Hanson. Three, two, one. This is unauthorized bill from Android Masquerade operating system. Barbra. I thought I lost you. Oh, what happened? You saved my life, you're like an amazing soldier. I guess that android sleeve that you were in really was a combat model after all. There was drone machines everywhere and by the time I got back to the apartment the TDF airships already take them out. Good, good. What about you, how did you get away? I was rescued. By the military unit? So search and rescue found you then? Not exactly. Terrorists. Terrorists? Yeah, the resistance fighters. The idiots that are trying to bring down Central Command. Even after tonight's attack they don't realize how idiotic that it is. But like how did you end up here here like in your body? That's the weirdest part. They thought that I was someone that they knew named Carlie. They thought that I had been captured by Central Command and they wanted to jack into my brain to read my memories and as soon as they did, I got kicked back here. That's crazy. So like, they didn't know that you were just an android shell? No, they gagged me before I had a chance to tell 'em. Well, then what happened? As soon as they jacked me in I came back here. Oh so it like kicked you back into your own body? Yeah, I guess. Thank God. Thank machine God. Stop it, stop it. Yeah. I guess they're gonna be pretty pissed when they figure they have an empty android on their hands. I know. Bad news for us, though. What do you mean? I don't think we're getting that deposit back. So, Barbra Slade. Yes. I'm Technician Lake. Let me first say thank you for your service, Sergeant and let me also congratulate you. It appears you are compatible. That's what the call said. Yes, the chip we implant in your lower back should tie directly into your cortex, via your existing spinal cord. Your ability to interface with it should be completely seamless and allow you to control the cybernetic leg enhancements. We'll be initiating the surgery momentarily. You should be feeling the effects of the anesthetic already. Yeah, she's feeling it. So you guys make house calls now? The military keeps its medical services mobile. Makes it harder for the drones to target. I guess that makes sense. But we start in surgery as soon as she's out. Are you sure you want to stick around for this? Yeah, maybe I'll just wait outside. That might be for the best. You're in good hands. You're gonna be fine. Oh, excuse me. All set. All set. Can I see her? She's resting but yes of course. Good luck to you and if all goes well your sister should be ready to return to active duty before you know it. Thank you. I kept wondering why we were back here. It was like a bad dream. Another android team, I don't even bother learning their names. We had no hard targets. Just grid sweep to grid sweep. This is Victor Victor Bravo reporting. Hold up. Say again, command. Victor Victor Bravo. Proceed with grid sweep. All right, go on. - Affirmative, sergeant. - Affirmative, sergeant. I felt a little better knowing Ice Maiden was keeping a sharp eye on the team. Confirmed, acquiring targets. Bravo, that is a negative. Energy signatures detected. Nitrogen's sending zero. Command, Victor Victor Bravo. Trooper Alpha is reporting energy signatures due west. If it's AI drones, we can engage. Negative. Roger, unit 239. You've got an android down there. Go ahead and take it out. Negative, sergeant, negative. We have close air support on station. That is not your air support, sergeant. I was out of range but firing warning shots at the drone cluster should of drawn their attention. No, no, no, no. No. Stand down, Victor Victor Bravo. Stand down, Victor Victor Bravo. Stand down. We'll be forced to shoot. What the hell was that out there? Calm down, sergeant. Calm down? My entire platoon was almost wiped out by our own people and now the drones have a clear path to New York. It was a miscommunication. Miscommunication? Look, your unit was a last minute addition to the roster, you were assigned to a grid location that overlapped with an existing operation. What kind of operation? That is on a need to know. That is bullshit is what that is. Look, Barbra, you well know that the safety of Terran Central Command hinges on the compliance of the people but the sick irony is that the sort of security can lead to complacency and in the face of complacency the seeds of insurgency are sown. Are you saying the drones are being allowed to attack? Look, the incursions are very tightly controlled and the threat is immediately neutralized as soon as order is reestablished. And that attack on the city the other night, was that one of these little wake up calls? It was. My sister was almost killed in that attack. Well I'm sorry, Barbra, but it is for the greater good. Go to hell! You know, perhaps I was a bit hasty in reinstating you. I think perhaps you need a bit more time to get your priorities straight. No. No, sir. That's ridiculous. Well, I'm going to tell everyone that this recent bought of insubordination is a direct result of your recent surgery. Barbra, I suggest you learn to put a lid on it. If you know what's good for you. Get out. What the hell are you doing here? I don't know. What are you talking about? I don't know who I am. I feel like my brain is full of holes. I don't remember my name, I don't know where I live. I saw you and I followed you. You seemed important. Like we were connected somehow. You know me. I barely know you. But you know something. I know your name is Tanner. Ryan Tanner. Ryan Tanner. And that the last time we met you thought I was someone named Carlie. Carlie? Does that mean something to you? No. That's all I got. Why did I think you were Carlie? I wasn't myself. The last time we met, I was in an android body. One of those avatars that you can jack into. So it was me but I was in a different body. And I recognized you as someone named Carlie? Yeah. But why? Well, this avatar was a rental. Maybe this Carlie was whoever rented it before me? So if we find her, maybe she can tell me who I am? Yeah, good luck with that. There's got to be someway. - Well. - What? I mean. If we go to that android rental place, they've got to have the previous renter on file. Yes, perfect. I don't know why I should want to help you with that, though. Pity? Bingo. Hold the door. What floor? What? What floor do you want? - Uh. - The same as you. Where did she get a gun? Full of surprises. Why's that company have to make these shells so damn fast? Come on. Well, I guess we'll bringing it back damaged. We'll take it our of the repo feed. That's how it works, innit? Just how many of you are there? All right, you do the talking, okay? Me? - Yeah, you do the talking? - I don't remember my name. Oh, welcome. Welcome to Android Masquerade. Where you can have the body of your dreams. How are you? Oh, I'm well. Thank you. My husband and I are looking for a new body. Oh, we have a wide range of styles to choose from. We're very particular. Oh, well can you describe the model that interests you? - Female. - Female. Shorter than me, red hair, cut short. Short. Now, stop if you see what you're looking for. - No. - Either one of you. No, no. Uh uh. Stop. Oh. Oh, excellent choice. Juliet 17. Is that model available? Well, let me check and see. Uh, I'm so sorry. It seems that the previous owner mislaid it. Well, can I show you another style or different model? It's so hard with the catalogs to get a sense of proportion. Proportion? Is it, would it be possible to inspect the models in person? Of course. Ta da. Now, as you can see, I'm wearing model Kelly 21. I had no idea that wasn't you. I know, it's impressive. Well, you know, if you want this model, I could step right of it, honey. I would be more than happy. No. No, no, no, no. I'm sure we can find something that will work for us. Yeah, very well, then. If you'll both follow me and. Would it possible, um. My husband and I, I kind want to surprise him. Could we inspect models and leave him here? I understand. Sir, sir. Would you mind having a seat and we'll be right with you. Oh sure, thank you. Well, that was exciting. At least I got to take my mind off real life for a little while. What's wrong with real life? That story I just told about getting out of surgery was true. What happened? You want a drink first? Sure. I am a Sergeant in the Terran Defense Force. You fight the robots? Yeah. Very cool. Thanks for keeping us safe. So, that's how you got hurt? Yeah. I was tracking a drone just outside the Dayton Line, only the bastard got the jump on me. Damn. Hit me dead in the spine. Shit. I was paralyzed from the waste down. Yet, here you stand. I got chip implanted and cybernetic leg implants. Right before that, I take it, you gave an avatar a try? Yeah, I got to try being a redhead for a little while. Good old model Juliet 17. Yeah. I always liked redheads. Yeah. About that. Did model Juliet 17 look at all familiar to you? Afraid not. Still pretty sketchy up here. The thing is, I think you and Carlie I think you were together. Like together together? But she was an avatar. They are very realistic. So who the hell was she? I don't know. You ready to find out? Guess so. Here we are, Juliet 17. It says the last registered user was someone by the name of Victoria Slade. Vicky, that's my sister. She rented it for me. Gotcha. So, who was before that? That's interesting. What? It says rental code G. What's that mean? I'll see if I can look it up. Here are the code definitions. A, B, C. Well? Of course. What? Government. Central Command? I'm starting to think that the people I respect aren't who I thought they were. What? Nothing. Nothing. Just losing my mind. Caller at door. Security clearance. Who is that? Stay there. It's okay, it's my sister. Hey, Vic. I'm sorry. For what? Vicky! Vicky. Just hang on, Vic. We'll get you help. Just hang on. - I - had never been in one of the black rooms at Central Command. This is where they put fifth colony humans who had gone over to the robot side. But I wasn't one of those. I was human. I was mostly human. My name is Agent Flackus, Central Command and you are Sergeant Barbra Slade. Care to tell me what you were doing harboring a known terrorist? No? Fair enough. We pinged you as soon as you accessed the database at Android Masquerade. Which wasn't very smart. We've been keeping tabs on that database ever since we had a little clerical error. An android we had taken out of that facility was accidentally put back into circulation. It was being used by one of our agents and it was supposed to stay here but shit happens. Mistakes were made. Who was she? Who was who? Carlie. Carlie, it's an alias, used by one of our agents, Karen Hall. The android was actually a custom job designed in her image. And you sent her to infiltrate the resistance group? Yes, she did a good job, too. We had the whole scoop on their little plan to blow up our headquarters here and we were all ready to greet them, too. It was a trap? Absolutely. Now, the question is, what was Tanner doing with you and what were you doing snooping around the data files for model Juliet 17? He thought I was her. You used the avatar? Yes. The two of you decided to figure out who Carlie really was? Yes. Hysterical. And were you aware you were aiding an terrorist in this little investigation? Yes. But he didn't know that. What do you mean? He has amnesia. You're kidding? I mean, that's the story he's been feeding us but I just figured that was a standard evasion. He really doesn't know who he is? Incredible. And you believe him? I do. Interesting. What are you gonna do to him? Well, standard procedure would be to hook him back up to the virtual cast, see what his old brain has to say for itself. Don't do it. Do what? Don't jack him in. I think that's what caused his amnesia in the first place? How so? When I was Carlie, when I was the avatar, I mean, his people hooked me up in the virtual cast alongside him and I think it effected his mind somehow. Well, maybe hooking him up again is just what he needs to snap himself out of it. Or it could tear his mind apart completely. Well, either we get the information we want or we get a brain dead terrorist. I can live with that. Don't hurt him, please. You are career military. You really want to throw all that away for a terrorist? I appreciate all the cooperation you've been giving me so far. If you keep it up, you might get out of this with a slap on the wrist. We'll continue this conversation after we've had a chance to run Tanner through the virtual cast. Tanner! Tanner! What are you doing? They only had one guy on me. I broke his neck and took his gun. Apparently, I can do that. You'll never get out of here alive. Funny, I feel really confidant I can. Come on. I can't. Why not? They were gonna let me go. They told me they were going to kill you. That can't be. What, why? They killed your sister. I know but. - We can't fight them. - I can get us out. But then what? We can fight them together. Come on, let's go. You remember the resistance now? You remember what you stand for? Things are starting to come back. Yeah, now please let's go. Shit! Drop the gun and surrender, Tanner. Come any closer and you're dead. Release the hostage. I think he's talking about you. Let me talk to them. They'll listen to me. Not gonna happen. Tanner. The agent told me about Carlie. What about her? She was an agent. Her real name was Karen Hall. What? She betrayed you. She knew all of your plans and she told them about the attack on Central Command. They were waiting for you. Carlie. There never was a Carlie. Just some woman that you never met looking out through avatar eyes. No. You were living a lie. Just like I was. Karen Hall! What's that? You want to negotiate my surrender? I only talk to Karen Hall. Fine. Hold on. What happened to me? How did I become connected to you? You remember, I told you when I was an avatar that you hooked me up to the virtual cast? Yes. I think that you were alongside me and our minds were connected, however briefly, and something must of gone wrong and it took your memory. Virtual cast. Yes. I remember. Yes? Lies on top of lies. I don't know what's real. Tanner. Who is that? My name is Karen Hall. Karen? You know me as Carlie. Carlie? Tanner. I'm sorry. You lied to me. I know, I did. I loved you. I know. I'm so so sorry. How could you do that to me? I had a job to do. A job? A job, it's that simple? No, it's never that simple. Especially not this time. What are you talking about? My name was a lie, who I was was a lie but my feelings for you weren't. You're playing me again! No, Tanner, I'm not. Please, throw the gun away. Let that woman go and let go of this insanity. Why? So we can be together? I wish that were possible. If I could be the Carlie that you thought you knew, I would but you know I can't do that. Can't you? Tanner, no! What's going on? It's the only way you'll be safe. Don't do this. Just surrender. I think I understand what's going on now. What are you talking about? I love you. I love you, too. You're not lying to me? No, never. Thank you. What happened? We jacked you and Carlie in and something insane happened. What? Well, first of all, a little surprised to learn that Carlie is an avatar. So, then we were monitoring the input in the machine and we realized that it was registering three sets of personalities instead of just two. Three? Machine didn't know what to do so it constructed a hybrid reality based on all three sets of memories. Three memories? Yeah, must of been pretty weird in there. Where are they now? Their brain imprints are still locked in the virtual cast. Can you pull them out? Sure but, which one do you want? What? I mean, technically the avatar only has space for one. If we pull them both out, the imprints will degrade each other eventually. Which one? That's what I'm asking. How am I supposed to decide? I loved them both. Tanner? Babe? I thought you were dead. No. Everything's going to be okay now. Let's go home. No, don't. They'll kill you. There's no one out there. What about Karen? Karen's gone now. Oh, yeah. What's happening? Just know that I love you. I love you. - I - had to leave you for now. But I will return as often as I can. In the meantime, make yourself a life of your choosing. Whatever you wish for can be yours. The world belongs to you now. She gonna be okay in there? She's gonna be fine. Welcome back, Tanner. Karen. I'm only a copy, you know? I don't care. I love you, Karen. Karen is someone else. You can call me Carlie. Ms. Barbra? Vicky? No, ma'am. I'm the biological attendant here at the facility. Where's my sister? I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that. What about the avatar? Ma'am, there's no such thing. I need to find Ryan. No. I need to find Ryan. What's going on, what's wrong with my legs? I do not know such stuff, ma'am. But you cannot walk. The machines could not fix that. No. No. This isn't right. I know. Put me back in. Back where? Back in the machine. Put me back in the machine. Put me back in the machine! Put me back in the machine! Please, put me back! Put me back in the machine, please! Put me back. Put me back in! Please. Please put me back. Oh please, please put me back. Put me back. In the machine.
