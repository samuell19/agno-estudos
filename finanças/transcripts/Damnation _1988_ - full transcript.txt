Starring a film by DAMNATION Let me in! What for? Let me in! I've been thinking things over. One's got to learn to make one's own decisions. I'm staying with my family. I want my daughter to be different from us. She'll have a different life. We won't have to explain to her. Let me in! Go away! Why can't you love me? I love you and you know it. You've got nothing to lose, Karrer. All you're risking is your own skin. Take a look around. You visit five rotten bars a day. You collapse into your bunk in the evening. It's time you moved out of here for a while... What do you say? You can't go on drinking cheap brandy all the time. It just stupifies you. It destroys your brain and puffs up your liver. I knew an old bum with hands so shaky that he wrapped a scarf around his wrist to get his glass up to his mouth. He didn't last long. I've never been abroad. A change would do me good. You go to the given address, pick up the package, bring it here. You get twenty per cent as travelling expenses. Make it more attractive. That's all you get. It's not the money. I just don't feel like leaving here. It's up to you. I wanted to help... What if... I know someone who would collect the package, for the twenty per cent. Plus petrol. Petrol? You can't even drive. I'm talking about someone else. I can't trust just anybody. Neither can I. It's finished, it's all over... over and there won't be another. It won't be good ever again... maybe never more. It's like a nightmare. Where is somebody new? Where will he come from if he comes? Or won't he come ever again? Maybe never more. Take it or leave it. What can you do? You lose your words yet, you cannot go. It's been over long ago. It's good there's Shangri-la, good to know I won't be here long. Take it or leave it. Say, honey, why? Why must it be over... over now? And there won't be another, it won't be good ever again... maybe never more. He's got my soul, things are going his way, without him this world is barren... with him life is full and happy. How could it be over? Silly never again maybe never more. It's over... there's no end... no end now it can't fade and it won't fade... ever again never maybe maybe never more. Leave my wife alone! - You misunderstand something. - What? All right. The next time I find you here I'll break your neck. He's completely insane. Take my advice, and don't go looking for trouble. Go home now and go to bed. You're not like them anyway. All they can do is get you into trouble. That woman is a witch. And her husband has had it... He'll never get away with the debt he's piled up. Anyone chatting her up gets the same treatment. That woman's a leech. She's a bottomless swamp. She'll swallow you up. That's the sad end of it all, son. Button up your coat properly. You never know in this foul weather. The fog gets into the comers, into the lungs... It settles in your soul... ...we'll know what to cling to once this world explodes... Mouth to mouth, heart to heart, star to star... but there'll be no shame and the veil will fall... I'm talking about Maya's veil... that covers men's brain and eyes. Besides GÃ¶rgey was a good strategist... He told Paskievics: if you want to kill 300,000 Hungarians do it in an internal war... What do you mean? All I'm asking is a million... To renew your faith and your honour! My honour? - Who would be witness to that... - It's true. I could offer this to anyone, but I thought of you. The trip's only three days. You pick up the parcel and bring it home. - How much? - Twenty per cent. All right. This way it's a nice family story. But it finishes like any other story. And all stories end badly, because they are always stories of disintegration. The heroes always disintegrate and they disintegrate in exactly the same way. Because if they didn't disintegrate, it would be resurrection not disintegration. And I'm talking about disintegration. Eternal and irrevocable disintegration by the way. What is about to happen here is just one of the million forms of ruin, and a rather petty form at that. So if they put you in jail because of your debts, you can't count on temporary ruin. Because this kind of ruin is final, as ruin generally is. At the same time there might just be a way to arrest this inevitable ruin. Mainly with money and not by playing the hero. Needless to say it doesn't help the inevitability of this breakdown. It can merely cover over a crack for a moment. I like rain. I like watching the raindrops pour down the window. That always calms me. I don't think about anything. I just watch the rain. I don't think any more of anything, or anyone... I'm getting away from here. Everything is so uncertain here, I can't trust anyone. I don't kid myself: I am alone. Giving up is something I can't and I won't do. Audiences in big cities are gonna applaud me. I'm going to win... and I won't tolerate others trying to drag me down. We must return to beauty... discover life once again... the joy of important things. The taste of victory and success. And this is what you can't do. Because you've already given up. You've killed the love and honour in you. You're going to come to a bad end. Because one can't live without love and honour. You may really be stronger than I am. You don't know what I'm capable of. I don't. On the house. Do you know the Good Book, young man? "Blow the horns, get everything in readiness... No one shall go to battle, my seething anger shall reach all the riches. Weapons take their toll outside inside there is hunger and plague... And if there be those who survive they shall be like the pigeons in the hills moaning under their sins. All hands shall lose their power, all knees shall tremble. People will be enveloped by fear. Their gold and silver shall not save them... on the day of the Lord's anger. It won't quench their hunger, or fill their bellies. It just led them into sin. I shall turn my face from them, those who befouled my sacred place. The country is full of bloodshed made legal and the city with violence. I shall bring here evil people who will take possession of the houses. There will be times of fear. They shall look for peace in vain, seeking visions from the prophet. Priests and elders will have no advice to give. The people of the land shall be paralyzed. I shall treat them as they deserve. Judge them by their judgements. Then they shall know that I am the Lord." I see you're in a hurry. I don't want to keep you. - Let's go out for supper. - Our accounts are settled. There's nothing for you here. I don't understand. What don't you understand? I still don't understand. You will one day. But I want to understand now. - Then understand now! - But I don't understand. You will one day. Let's go out for supper. Let go of me! Dirty little snooper! Calm down! You're not going to get away with it! No way! You'll rot like a rat! - You're totally crazy! - Leave me be! - Let me go! - Easy! Lei go! - Stop it! - Get out of here! - Leave me be! - Stop it! ...they all fell, and were swept away by the cold winter winds. There was a message from my baby on one of the leaves: Goodbye my love, my darling, we can't live our lives together. Autumn and the grim winter passed, springtime came again, there was a message from my baby on one of the leaves... Goodbye my love, my darling, we can't live our lives... The leaves from the silver birch have fallen they all fell and were swept away by the cold winter winds. There was a message from my baby on one of the leaves: Goodbye my love, my darling, we can't live our lives together. Autumn and the grim winter passed... springtime came again. There was a message from my baby on the leaves: Goodbye my love, my darling... BUTCHER Let go of me! Listen to me! - I'm sorry... - I've had enough of you. I didn't want to hurt you. Stop or I'll kill you! Leave me alone! I didn't mean to hurt you. - You know I didn't. - Get away from me. You're right about everything. I admit you're right about everything. You know that I love you. I couldn't lie to you now, I'll change. I promise to change but you have to help me. Hit me if you want to... When you looked at me yesterday I realized something. I realized that there's an enticing tunnel from you to a world eternally out of reach. I don't know anyone else who knows that road. You're standing alone at the entrance to the tunnel because you know something I can't even put a name to. Something deeper and more ruthless than I can ever understand. I could never get closer to that world, only long for it because it is hidden by a light and warmth I am unable to bear. I was never able to believe in it or renounce it. Now I realize I made a fatal mistake. If I were to lose you it would be the irremissable end of me, because I know nothing about that unnameable world. Since you are part of it, you mean that world to me entirely... irrevocably. Don't reject me. Let me see you, and I'll do anything for you. Kick me, spit on me and I'll return over and over for you to kick and spit on because you are right, you are ruthlessly right. And I really do love you. Are you just going to stand there? I sit by the window and look out totally in vain. For years and years I've been sitting there, and something always tells me that the next moment I'll go mad. But I don't go mad the next moment, and I have no fear of going mad because fear of madness would mean that I'd have to cling to something yet I don't cling to anything. I cling to nothing, but everything seems to cling to me, wanting me to take notice. To see the hopelessness of things. Watch as a mangy dog outside my window walks up to a puddle and has a drink in the torrential rain. I have to watch the pitiful effort people make trying to speak before they drop into the grave. But there's no time because they're already falling. I'm expected to go mad because of the irreversibility of life. On the other hand I'm not supposed to go mad. Once I talked about this to a woman but she was incapable of understanding. I told her I hated her, I'd never loved her. Yet I didn't hate her just as I'd never loved her. I wanted to know if talking made sense at all. I told her I hated the way she painted her nails. I hated her tenderness and loyalty... I loathed her fastidious movements, the way she did everything so meticulously. I was revolted by the blind trust with which she clung to me. She looked at me disapprovingly and went off to heat up my supper. I just stood there and yelled at her. For three days we stayed indoors. For three days she shuffled around behind me. She only started crying the third day. She stood there crying in her nightie. She didn't sob, she just whimpered, in a high-pitched tone, and didn't move. Then she squatted in the comer and she didn't move from there. I just looked at her nightie. All I saw was that nightie, that lacy nylon nightie. Then I fell on her. I pulled it and ripped it, then stamped on it. She still didn't understand, she just clung to me, trying to clasp me to her, and repeating something over and over. Then she went into the bathroom and locked the door. I just watched the buckets passing by and counted them. Then I counted them all over again. It was dawn by the time I broke the door down. It was what I expected but even so it shocked me. I never thought there'd be so much blood in that frail body. Just as I never thought there'd be anyone I'd be as sure of as I am of you. Someone to make me feel it's worth talking. I know you understand if I say I love you and it's not the end... I know you can step out of this story. Just as you can step out of any story. And I want nothing more than that we leave this pigsty for ever... and never lose each other again. So now it's me you want to look at? I'd do even the basest things to make you choose me. Maybe. But my husband comes home tomorrow evening. The problem is I'm afraid of children. Because those innocent blue eyes, those blonde plaits, cheery, ringing voices hide a stealthy and ruthless power whose purpose is to keep up the madness of hopelessness, to give a new incentive to the reality drumming on our eardrums, to ridicule all resistance without the tiniest chance of salvation. Yet they proclaim a minute chance of salvation - resurrection itself- in such a way that we cannot escape its elemental continuity. Perhaps it just means that I've given up, that I'm a coward, a god-awful coward. I daren't even hope my fate will change for the better. All I do is make excuses for my cowardice through nausea. How about thinking of something but yourself for once? Can't you understand? I've got old. I'm a wreck who doesn't dare do anything. That's the surest sign of old age. Even before your teeth fall out, before you go bald or destroy your liver your courage departs and you haven't the guts to do what you'd have done earlier without even a chance of success. The trouble with you is you see things from your angle. Do you think it makes a difference what you think about yourself or others? You should realize there's order in the world and you can't do anything to upset it. Others get old too. What makes you think that we're all cowards? No. I know that you yourself are just cautious. All right. Drink up. I'm closing. Give me another one. This is the last. I wish I knew what makes you think you'll survive anything and anyone? Why don't things have an effect on you? That's something I don't understand. There are a lot of things you don't understand. So what... Drink! You too! There's always a chance to escape. There can be cracks in the fabric of things. Always a chance things won't go wrong. But you won't get away with it! If I don't break your neck someone else will. You're sure to come to a bad end. I'll drink to that... and to you. I can put up with your friend less and less... What's wrong with him? I don't like people who try to cheat me from the start. He has a lot to learn before he takes me on. He shouldn't try it at my expense. He cheated you? The package was opened. - Things seem to be missing. - Why not ask? No point. He'd say it was damaged en route. A lot of damage? I work with safety margins. But my reliability's at stake. You know me, people can talk to me, discuss things. I'm a good-hearted man. He should be glad I got him out of trouble. I'll never understand his kind. "I'm just sitting here mourning for you, darling counting the time till I'm seventy. We never had a son but others had more to lose. I won't see you after death, love, because I don't believe in it, and you had your doubts. It's just around twilight when I think of you, I see your tired forehead in the dust." What a lovely colourful crowd. A party. Dance! Arms, legs and hips working in perfect harmony! The way movements speak... glances that lift the dancer above his daily worries. The young are so lovely! Believe me, there is nothing like finding one another - when there is music that warms the heart. Two hands clasped together one foot senses where the other will step. And follows, no matter where the other leads. Because one believes that every turn and swing will be like flying from now on. Who knows - perhaps it is flying. Go on, young man... before its too late. Believe me, there is nothing worse in a man's life than when he realizes that those he loves, those who belong to him, those he feels are his friends, well, when it suddenly turns out that these friends are on a fatal track and their sins prevent them from finding the right path again. Because they have lost the chance for ever to straighten themselves out like good citizens, and live freely under the protection of the law, enjoying the peace of an honest life. So it was this awful inner tension that brought me here, setting the affectionate friend in me aside to fulfill the duty my deep respect for order imposes on me. Please do not consider my report as some kind of cheap gossip. I authorize you to mention my name if you think fit, since I have told you everything with head held high, aware of my responsibilities... and accepting all the consequences... POLICE
