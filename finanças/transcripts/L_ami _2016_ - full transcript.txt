I followed the words of Christ "If someone commands a friar your life or his soul, he is not obliged to obey him." Are these also words of Christ? If one obligates a brother to sin he must refuse. Do you want to create an order or do you want to encourage disobedience? Senla hierarchy you will be but a group of vagabonds, heretics. Nothing more. But we want to create only a fraternity, ... where everyone is the same, and live in poverty, simply Meanwhile, resume your rule, it's good for pigs.

In fraternity we also welcome enemies You wrote it in the Rule, and this is perhaps what they can not bear We have no enemies, our enemies are our brothers. - We dream. If we do not do something, we will come loose We must obey and rewrite the Rule - If so, I prefer to leave. Will you leave us? Yes why not ? But what do you believe? What compromises with Rome is not to betray our votes? The word of God that received Francis is truth. The truth is not traded. We gave our lives to be here and here we are happy. And should we still listen to the powerful? Do not rewrite the Rule, Francesco, do not rewrite it Brothers, our life is a simple life. What are we going to do ? We sleep, like the poorest, outdoors We do not accept money, even when we work in the fields, never What we do is reach out day after day, to receive what God gives us (Francesco) And he gives us so much No (laughing) Look at you!

We are like this grass, bent by the wind, which clings Nothing more - Everything else, it's pride. Are you proud too, Francesco? - Yup You do not have to have to receive God. What you think is contrary to our life The Pope told us to sweeten our lives but we must sweeten those of others. If we can do more for them, he will have to recognize us for fora.
