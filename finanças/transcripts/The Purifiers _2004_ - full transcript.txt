NARRATOR: The moon is like a bullet. Silver, smiling, beautiful... violent. What happens to us when doubt is all we have? When dreams are the medicine... The antidote to madness? Who are we? What are we? Why are we numb? Senseless? Unable to nurture hope? RADIO: Our daily stats tell us that crime levels have fallen yet again in every category. Yesterday was down 2% on average, another remarkable achievement which the city authorities were quick to claim responsibility for. The city election enters its final phase with no clear picture emerging as to who will be the outright winner, although the relatively unknown Moses appears to have upset the usual status quo, and may well have caught the younger vote. In the gray zones, a serial stalker has yet to be caught. His latest victim, an 18 year old woman, was attacked in the early hours of this morning. Police are warning women to be vigilant if they intend to be out late this weekend. The weather for the rest of the weekend looks like this, a mixture of sunshine and showers. [glass shattering] Come here. [screaming] [screaming] Shh, shh, shh. WOMAN: What are you doing? What... what are you doing? This could be easy, or this could be difficult. So, what's it going to be? [grunting] Give me the tape, Sam. [siren] NARRATOR: What do you believe in? Friendship? Family? Loyalty? Trust? Do you remember kindness? Care? Benevolence? Goodness? I try. I try to remember all those things, but somehow it begins to slip as I fall. Fall into a deeper sleep. I dream of the wind and the rain being caught in the natural storm, cleansed... Cleansed for a moment, and then... and then you realize it won't last for long. And then you wake. And then you roar at the world, and the world roars back. Yes, the world roars back. Push back! Come on! Careful, Johnny. You never know what might happen next. [shouting] Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, baby! [shouting] Come on! Come on! NARRATOR: The first fight's always the toughest. But it gets easier. You ready, Raz? Yeah. Stick tight, and be calm. He thinks he can win quickly. He can't. Remember, only fools forget to be afraid. How's he doing? He's all right. A bit scared, though. What's in the letter? Let's deal with this, first. Finish him off! Come on! Yes! Some help? No way. I got you that. No, watch, watch, watch. I'm not sweaty. Come on! WOMAN: You can't. MAN: Man, you're a cheating dog. I can see it. Take a shot. He's got it. What's up, John? There's been a meeting called tonight. Who by? Moses. So, what do you think? I'm not sure. It's been tried before, finding common ground between the clubs. But it's pretty clear we're all doing it for different reasons. Shouldn't we be seen to be interested? Why? Why? Otherwise maybe we're seen as being nothing. Insignificant. You know how it is. The Purifiers... yesterday's men. Where'd you get that from? In the big picture... The really big picture against the likes of Moses? Come on. Tell me, who are be? Whoever we want to be. No. No, we can't be. If we look weak, or we don't engage, then they'll join together, with or without our blessing. And then what? They come in here with everything. All we've built just... Falls apart. He's got a point. But we can stand back and do our own thing. I mean, we've done that. They take, we don't. But they get stronger, and we... Well, we... We at least have a reason for being here. Don't forget what it was like. How it used to be before John. Shit, I'm not saying that. That's not what I'm saying. What are you saying, Sol? I'm saying... we should at least go see Moses, and find out what they want. We know what they want. I say we vote on it. Sure. You're right. We should vote on it. All those who want us to be present at the meet, raise their hands. I want to go, John. Sorry. OK, so we're going to the meet. But let's agree on one thing... If trouble kicks off, we get out of there. If some are left behind, it's up to them to get home. Are we agreed? NARRATOR: The city has been divided into zones. We keep to our own space. That's the rule. The only rule. It's safer that way. But tonight we enter the central zones, where fear is in the silence of every street. And Moses, the self-proclaimed savior of the dispossessed, is king. His world is political, violent, out of control. And very, very dangerous. Welcome. Look at us, here tonight. Together, as one. I am Moses. These are my friends and business associates. This is our home, which we love and protect. We love this place. You see? You see how we feel about this place? We love this space. We love this city. This is our city, the same as you. We feel the same way you feel. The Pumas. Proud. Laughing in the face of any man who thinks he might be bigger or better. The new boys, the Eels. We welcome you. Valuable friends. And the Angels bring their intelligence and strength. Worthy foes. Worthy friends. Our neighbors, the Wolves. You see, it is possible. You can be in the same place at the same time. Here is the proof. And finally, John. John and his Purifiers. Still there, John? Looking after your team. Still there, fighting the bad guys. Brilliant. Brilliant and beautiful. Look at us. Look around you. Success, hope, vision, belief. We're different. We never gave up. We never accepted the shit that was on offer. No, we said. No! No! No! You see how it is. Think of how it could be. We are the future. We are the truth. The only truth that matters to us. We believe. What do we believe in? We believe in the possibility. This is our business. We are our own government, church, and finally. We are the only people to turn to when our communities are in trouble. We are the infrastructure, the safest net that people can land on when they feel forced to jump. We are the law. We are the law. We are the law! Look around you. Look at us. We're beautiful. We are beautiful, and it's time we took what was rightly ours. So where we are. Alone we are strong. Independent. But together, we are an army. Look at what's coming. If people vote for me... When people vote for me... If I win... when I win... I'm on the inside, standing shoulder to shoulder with them. The establishment. I'm offering you the chance to stand there with me. Have power. Real power. Start to reap the rewards of being in control. Change your world. Make it a better place. For you. Become part of a city that no longer stands back and watches as you clean up their mess. No. No. Become part of a city that embraces you. [inaudible]? Reward you. If you're in, then tomorrow we create together. If you're not, go now. Tomorrow we grow. We work out ways of turning our strengths into one force, to make our businesses work together. Tomorrow we discuss the details. Tonight, if you are in... Enjoy the freedom of the zones. If you're not with us... Then you're against us. It would be smart to leave. Quickly. And quietly. Until tomorrow, then. Good night. What do you think, John? I don't like it. Surely what he was saying made sense? Come on, Sol. We've been here before. You know we can't trust them. Maybe he meant what he said? That it's time for us to be rewarded? And what does that mean? Unite, alongside him? Them? Take control? Exactly. Control who the fuck feels they can walk into our lives and bring their poison with them. What, you think that's what they have in mind? You think that the Wolves, Moz and his crew, the Angels will follow that idea? I mean, look at those guys. They've put their cards on the table. They're gangsters. And what are we, John? Maybe it's us that are out of touch with the real world? What are you saying? Oh, you want to go along with this? Us and them together? You think the years we spent trying to change things are going to be helped by this? By them? They don't do what we do. Maybe the truth isn't so bleak as you think it is. Maybe... Maybe you want it to sound like that. He means take control of running drugs from the top to the bottom of the city. He means taking control of every slippery piece of shit that we can get our hands on together. Under his control. Is that what bothers you, John? Oh, man. You should know better than that. You're right. OK, I'm sorry. What was it they said? It would be smart to leave quickly and quietly. Hey ho. Let's go. Oh, John. Oh, John. Why did you have to spoil the fun? When? Let the others deal with it. Tell them all the deal is a dream, and that the Purifiers are history. Done. John, John. Beautiful John. [whistling] [shouting] [engines revving] Split. We'll meet at the station. If trouble runs into you, run from it. Got it? Remember, we've gotta get back. Sol, stick with Raz. Don't worry. I'll look after him. [siren] Oi! Shit! Come on. Glad to see you, man. Have you seen the others? Shh. They're down there, waiting for things to calm down. - What, everyone? - Yeah. Get down there. Go. I'll keep watching. Go. This doesn't feel right. You know how it is, John. Frances! [grunting] [glass shattering] This way! Quick! Where are they? We've gotta get out of here, so call them again. This is the last train. Come on, Raz. Come on. There's no answer. We can't leave them! Not here. Not alone. - What about Sol? - Same. No reply. I'm not going. What do you mean, you're not going? Listen... Sol's with Raz. He'll take care of him. They'll be fine. Now come on, we've gotta go. - Li. - No. - This is crazy. You can't stay. Not against all of them. Come on. Li! I said we've gotta go. Li! Don't look at me that way. What way? We agreed, home first. No matter what happened, we had to get back. We left them. We didn't leave them. We stuck to the plan. We left them behind. You want Something? You want something to eat? What about you? You want something? Yes, we do. You want a menu? No. We know what we want. What was that? Speak English. English. Understand? I said English. English! Shut up! Huh? [snorting] Huh? Huh? - You want to order now? - Fuck you! No, fuck you! [shouting] [shouting] [shouting] [glass shattering] [shouting] [shouting] [screaming] SINGER: You were born under a bad sign. I can hear it when they call. You were born under a bad sign. I can hear it... What happened to the truce? You were there. You heard what they said. You know what the deal is. This is not what we agreed! Sol? Sol? Sol, help me! Sol! Sol! Sol! FEMALE VOICE: We left them behind. MALE VOICE: We left them behind. [ringing] Where are you? Where have you been? It's bad here, John. Very bad. They have Raz. Can you hear me? John? Slow down. Tell me where you are. I can hardly hear you. I'm in the building where they had the meeting. They have Raz. They took him inside. He looked hurt. What shall I do? Where are you? When can you get here? We're on the train, Sol. The line's breaking up. Did you say you're on a train? John? You're leaving us? We agreed. Fuck the agreement. You're leaving us? Nice. What if he won't come? He'll come back. You were too good. MALE VOICE: The only people to turn to when our communities are in trouble. MALE VOICE: We are the infrastructure. The safest net that people can land on when they've been forced to jump. We are the law. MALE VOICE: We are the law. MALE VOICE: We are the law! What's happening? Let's go. - Where? - Back. We're going back? We're going back. Yes! [engines revving] [music playing] SINGER: Fearsome. A heart of summer sun. Don't let them take it away. [engines slowing down] [engines revving] Going somewhere? Trying to. Look like you're going back. Well, we left something behind. Something important? Very. You know, I've always had a soft spot for you, John. You're cute. But you're dumb. Thanks. - Is this the one? - That's her. One of my girls has seen you around. And? Can't place you. So? Gave her a bad feeling. Well, maybe that's because she knew I was coming to get you. [laughter] Her first. Come on. You like? Get up, Frances! You like? [explosion] [ringing] It's them. Good. Don't answer it. Like I said, he's an easy read. He's a fool. No, no, no. He's a dreamer, not a fool. He believes in people like you. He thinks you care about the same things he does. What happened there, Sol? When did you realize you'd made the wrong choice? The day you left. You stayed with him all this time. Can I trust you, Sol? - What do you mean? Are you to be trusted? Of course. Are you? Trust. Trust? Fuck trust, Moses. I've been sitting at home watching you become king of the hill. Yes, I stood by him. And look where it got me. Still in the shit. Still getting nowhere. And they keep saying, this is our time. My time. Well, time for me to sit up there beside you. Become a king. I deserve it. I fucking deserve it! I'll call them again. Where are you going? I can't get a signal. Well, be careful. Where's she going? She's going to find a phone. Why's it so quiet? Well, this is what he wants. People too scared to come out at night. Curfewed, and not willing to do anything about it. What a wonderful life. He sold his ideas pretty well. Well, that's what he does. He sells empty dreams. Gives people hope. It's hypnotic. Easy. Your hand. It's fine. Give it to me. Give me your hand. What are you doing here, Frances? What do you mean? You don't have to do this. I mean, you could do anything. Move on, get away from here. Find something better. Is there somewhere better than this? Seriously. You can get out. You know that, don't you? I know. Do you want me to go? No. Hi. Are you open? What do you think? Nice. Got a problem? No. Good. Do you have a phone I can use? Yeah, she's in here. Yeah, no. No, none of the others. Just her. Yeah. I'll keep her in here. Don't worry. Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's not very nice. [shouting] Get off! [screaming] Bitch. What happened in there? Bad service. You all right? Angels. Time to stop running, John. I hear you. So, how do you want to do this? So, John, it looks like there are two of us to your one. Praise the lord. He can count. Bastard! That's for the cafe. So, John, looks like there are now three to your one. I'll go. Alone. With you in the car. But they have to be left behind. You see? That's what I've always liked about you, John. You've got a firm grasp on reality. All right. Let's play it your way. They stay here, you come with us to meet the man. Hm? John. Get her home this time, Frances. Home. They're not gonna take you. They'll take me. Moses wants me back. That's right, Johnny. He wants you back. [music playing] So what happens now? Well, this is all very civilized, John. Is it? You know, I don't think it's too late to tell Moses you're sorry. Yeah. Tell him you made a mistake. That you now want to be a part of the family. The family? Part of the family, John. The new family. One that doesn't try to hold back change. One that can move with every twist and turn of the planet. Or maybe you didn't get it the first time around? I got it. You know, I never quite understood you, John. I mean, you're the oldest, right? The most experienced. Yet you can't see what's right in front of you. It's over, baby. Your way... it's over. Your gang. You asked them to make the wrong decisions. Now look at the mess they're in. All broken up. That's on you, John. At least one of you had the good sense to look to the future. What does that mean? [laughter] Oh... I need to take a piss. Pull it over. WOMAN: Why don't you come down here and join me? Come on. Here's a thought, John... No matter you think you are, and who the people around you are, there's always a chance you'll end up disappointed. [shouting] Don't you think it's all one big disappointment, Johnny? Even you... the mighty you... Ending up here. Betrayed by your own people. It's a sad song, John. It's a sad song. Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car! They won't be coming. We thought you... I'm OK. You gotta go. - Sure. Together. We go together. Not without you. Not without Raz. Raz won't be coming. What do you mean, Raz won't be coming? He's not coming, Li. Go. Go now. Not coming? You've got to go, Li. With you? No. Listen to me. [ringing] Yeah? Yes. I know. OK. I'll set him up. I'm looking for her. No, it's OK. I'll find her. She'll do what I ask her to do. OK. Bye. You said just now that you were going to call him and set him up. What does that mean? You said just now that you were going to call him, and set him up. Is that John? Is that John? Li... don't do this, Li. [slapping] [shouting] I'm sending John a text. Telling him we're OK. What? Have you seen him? I mean, is he close by? What am I supposed to do, man? Well... what if... I mean, what if... Oh, fuck. You scared the shit out of me, mate. Where'd you come from? Do you want to finish? What? No. I was just... trying to get in touch with you. Find out where you were. Well, here I am. Just give me a minute. SAM: Where are you going? Stay in the car, OK? Anything happens, leave without me. Frances... Yeah? Be careful. Take me to Raz. Bring her round. SINGER: Y'all ready for this? Y'all ready for this? Y'all ready for this? Johnny! Johnny! Hello, John. Had a busy night, have we? You see, even your own people don't care about you anymore. Do you know what they want? They want the same as the rest of us, Johnny. Only you're in the way. Until now! [grunting] Your little friend... What was his name? Rose? Raz! Raz. That's right. [screaming] We got him, Johnny. I finished him. Yeah, Johnny. We finished him. Finished him! Left him lying there in his own pathetic, cowardly bile. Introduced him to the grave! Well... we did do [inaudible], Johnny! [shouting] What did you do? Tell me again. What did you do? What did you do? NARRATOR: You become like them. Hopeless. Violent. You leave the world of dreams behind. You enter their world. You become an animal, in search of revenge. [music playing] SINGER: Y'all ready for this? Y'all ready for this? Y'all ready for this? [creaking] So, Frances... here we are. Tell me, was it really that easy? I heard that you and John were pretty close. Do you think he knew, or has he just lost his touch? Frances. The real world is not a place for dreamers. Don't you agree? I mean, look at you. Playing along with his tired ideals, but really only using him to keep a closer eye on what was happening. You're very good. Just not good enough. Hello, Frances. It's her. She's a cop. Good. Then get out. How far did you take it, Frances, in the line of duty? How far did you... Played the game? Sol! Come and join the party. Say hello to your friend. You two have a lot in common. Both betrayed the very person who gave you his most prized possession. Isn't that right, John? That thing you value above everything else. That very thing that brought you back here. Trust. Isn't that right, John? So here we are again. You and me. Old friend. Friends. Are we not, John? You could have been part of this. - Not this. - No? Too bad. The reasonable man adapts himself to the world, while the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Where you lie in that tight little paradigm? Can you change? Or does the world have to change to you? It may seem like I'm being unreasonable, John, but I'm the one looking to the future while you're the one stuck in the past. Your world is in freefall. It's over. Don't you see what you have done for me? All the others... amazing. I told them you could do it, but no one would believe me. But you did it. Ran through them as if they weren't there. Beautiful. You did that! All the others in disarray, torn apart by you. Only me left now, to pick up the pieces. Aw, I'll stick them all together again, but this time, in a better way. More, uh... how would you say it, John? Integrated. Offer them something new. What are you offering, John? A myth. I'm offering something bigger. A new and better version of the truth. And now here we are again, you and me. What do you think? Exciting. This is it. This is it, John. What do you think? What do I think? Seeing you again, Moses... Being here... reminded me of something. What we are, and what we've done has meaning. Real meaning. What you are means nothing. You've stopped dreaming, Moses. This is... it's empty. Cheap. A poor imitation of something we already know doesn't work. Very good. Stay out of this. NARRATOR: We try. We do. To win. To not fail. Here we are, you and me. Lost again. For a moment we are quiet as the ocean swirls, the moon pulls us closer, and the stars sparkle as though we were insignificant. And we... we try. We do. [click] Want to call it a day, John? That's what happens, John. You try to do the right thing. You try to make every little moment count. You want to help. You really want to help. And what's your reward, John? The reward, John, is a world that couldn't give a shit. They hate you! They hate us all. You never understood that like I did. You were too busy dreaming to notice. [shouting] Now I'm not feeling so charitable. [grunting] [screaming] So, here we are again. What happens next? What happens next, Moses? Do I finish it? Or do I leave? Quickly, and quietly? You leave. Safely? Safely. And Frances? What about Frances? Tell them! She's safe. Frances, leave. Now! Fast! John. John? John! This is not the end! You understand that, don't you? It's unstoppable! This is just the beginning. Next time we meet, I am going to kill you. Do you understand that, John? Next time, you're a dead man! You're a dead man, John. Sol! What happened? We have to move. Now. Moses. - What happened? Moses beat John. He's coming for us. Let's go. You drive. OK. [inaudible]. [shouting] No! You bastard! Frances. Frances? We've got some unfinished business. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. Sorry, John. What now? Now... now I walk away. And I don't look back. And you... you've gone. NARRATOR: The moon like a bullet. Silver, smiling, beautiful, violent. Tonight the world is deathly silent. Tomorrow it roars again. [music playing] SINGER: Well, the moon's like a bullet. Cars full of silver, and well fed. Shining headlights through your window. Everything, everything. Take it down. Come on. Take it down. You're in some sort of dark corner. Dark, dark. No help. No reason. You've got no reason. You've got no reason. You got no reason. You got no reason for doing this to me. Darkness and filth. The stench of reality. Hey! The stink of everything. Spiders' eyes, landlady sidewalks, bars, buildings, grass, no grass, light, no light! Nothing belongs to you. You're walking through a sea of fire, but you can pick it up! Cause you can pick it up! Or they're gonna cut you up. I'm walking through a sea of fire. And I'm here. And I'm 12. Uptown. It's so easy. Downtown. Life might please ya. Down, down he goes. The boy from Glasgow. Uptown! Downtown! Uptown! Downtown! Uptown! Downtown! I live downtown! She lives uptown! I live downtown! She lives downtown! I live uptown! I live downtown! Uptown, life is easy. Downtown, life might please ya. Down, down we go. Down, down we go.
