There's always been shoujo manga right? I don't even have to do anything. Girls just fall in love with me. They always flock around me. I'm a ladies man. That is me. It seems like I've been a ladies man since I was born. He's really cute isn't he? That's right! All throughout my early childhood too! In elementary school and junior high school too. Being a ladies man is my distinctive character type. Even when I started high school, that position didn't change. I remained as the ladies man character. I just enjoyed my high school life to the fullest. Shit! Why is it always that guy? He should let us have a little fun too! Where's the class meet up part? They are just going nuts over him is all it is! If someone had the magic to turn him into an ugly guy, that would be awesome! True that! Man...they sure do love me huh? Sorry boys... Alright, let me get a drink... Time for the hurt! Okay~ Hold on! That hurts! Now, now, now! Listen to this! What is it? Yo bros... I got a girlfriend! A girlfriend!? Wanna see? Wanna see? Wanna see? You know you want to! So sexy! Right? How'd you do it Koji? You little... What the hell Koji? You're pretty popular aren't you? Itsu-chan and Ryusei need to work hard too! Why are you acting so cheeky Furuya? Well...I'm just a real guy doing real things. No, but you've never had a girlfriend have you? You've never had one since you were born right? No..well..umm...that's just because I've been loved so much by people... This is what you are. You are a admiration boy. An admiration boy? An admiration boy is a boy that is loved by women and is admired by them but it's all superficial and the girls never actually try to get with him. The girls just look at you and enjoy themselves is all there's to it! You're no different than these guys over here. Hello? It's me. I'm...an admiration boy? Yes? Hello? I'm an admiration boy? I'm an admiration boy? I'm definitely not an admiration boy! Furuya Touwa is going to make a girlfriend! Is that so? Good luck. Itsu, Ryuusei. Let's go to the school shop. Hey...hey...hold on! Stop looking at me with just pitiful eyes like he did when he was talking to me! By the way...who's your partner? Touwa. You don't have anyone you like right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Look for Touwa's girlfriend! Those are cheerleaders aren't they? What about that girl? She's the sporty type! Rejected. That girl is a model for a magazine! You should just choose the most beautiful girl. Rejected! Why bro? Then how about that campus belle? A cute liberal arts girls is nice! Not enough, not enough! Yo bro... How do you think you're going to pick up a girl like this? This is a girl that the almighty Touwa is going to pursue after. I can't just pick up some girl! Can I hit him? Go ahead! Let's decide! Let's do it! One! Two! Three! Four! Touwa? Touwa? Touwa-kun? Touwa? I've decided! Miwa Misono? The one chosen by God! The supreme angel! She's been alone for 17 years! She's so beautiful it hurts! That Miwa Misono? What do you mean she's been alone for 17 years? Basically it means that she's super hard to catch! How many men do you think have tried? She won't say "I like you" to anyone! She's in the same class as you! Have you ever spoken to her? Hey bros...who do you think I am? That's right... If it's Touwa then it might happen! He can do it...he can do it! Is he going to be okay? The license plate on the bus he took this morning was 4444! That's super bad luck! There you go again! Always thinking negatively! Like I said! There's no girl out there that would reject the almighty Touwa! That's right! There's not a single girl out there! Yes! Yes! Alright! I'll be going now! Miwa! Furuya? Do you need something? You've...taken my interest. Why don't you become my girlfriend? My face is so close to hers. There's no way she's going to reject me. What are you doing? What a cheap confession! Are you ready? Hey you girl! Presented to you by Rjgman56 subs. Touwa? Touwa? How long are you going to be laying around here? If you don't get up soon then we are going to tickle you! Furuya! That's right! We're gonna tickle you! Why? Why did a ladies man like me.... I don't know what I did wrong. No way... I can't believe Touwa got rejected... I said it didn't I? Today is super unlucky! Well, it's all good! Let's try the next girl! The next girl! Next we have Nikumi Nishiwa from class 2. Then we have Aihara Riko from the gymnastics club. Let's go get some easier targets! What the heck? Do you need us to introduce you to some girls? Oh that's right! Let's do it! Let's start the DDD alliance! DDD? We need to have a name first! What? What do you mean? Like I said... I mean... Is that what DDD is? (Doutei means virgin. Danshi means man. So it probably stands for virgin men or something) We can't stay like children forever right? That's why we need to work together and find some girls! Then we will become adults! Alright! Touwa! Why do I have to be with you guys? We're not in the same league! Now then, let us start the first DDD meeting. Firstly we need to find a new target. Yes! What is this? No way... The time for victory has come! Hey Touwa! You have to find a girl who likes to eat a lot! Why's that? Oh man...oh man... They are saying online that big appetites and strong sexual desires go hand in hand. That's why a girl who loves to eat food might be pretty sexual. You're thinking all kinds of naughty stuff aren't you bro? Hey Touwa! Touwa! Go after a girl like this next! That is true... The way I was going about this was wrong. The cool type of girls like Miwa are going to act spoiled. You're not giving up? I can't have my ladies man title be tarnished right? Misono! Sorry about yesterday! I was suuuuuper nervous! I've never confessed to anyone before you see. How can I say this? I'm pretty popular... Wait...she's not there! Hold on! Hey Furuya... Yes? Do you like me? I do...like you... Really? Yeah! You don't just want a girlfriend? You're so lame! How can I say this? That reaction...even if she gets pushed down by a man she doesn't get nervous at all! How can she be so unfazed at all times? 25% of people who are rejected when they confess are able to get revenge on the other person by making them fall for them. That's a little higher than I expected. But he just confessed to her without good timing, or a proper situation or anything. There was no method to it. That's true. First you need to make the girl's heart beat fast! This is a ranking of girl's favorite situations! The 8th one on the list is to meet them in an unexpected place by coincidence! But Miwa Misono's heart isn't going to beat faster at all. She probably is never going to fall in love... It seems like she doesn't have an interest in men or love at all. Umm...are you okay? Yes. I'm okay. Excuse me... Please give up your seat! Please! Why does it have to be me? There's a ton of other people here aren't there? That's a handicap seat isn't it? Hurry and get up! What a pain in the ass! Come on! Go ahead. Thank you! It's nothing. Why did you do all of that? I'm getting off! Let me go! What's up with you? Stop it!!! My hand... The 5th one is to save her in a crisis! What the hell bro? Stop it! Move! Get the hell off me damn it! Stop it! What the hell you bastard! Let go of me... Hello? Is this the police? Shit! Furuya....are you okay? I'm okay! I'm okay, I'm okay! Your face isn't hurt or anything? The 3rd one is to overcome a crisis together! So in other words, when you were trying to save Miwa you got beat up? Yeah... That isn't your character type at all! That's right! I know right? Misono... What's up with that face? Was yesterday a success? Does she like me? Mi-misono... Later! Yo Hamada! Why did you say that? Misaki sensei! Good morning! Morning! Miwa! The next... Hey... Why is she making that face? No, no...no way.... Does this Misono chick feel that way about Misaki? It's over! What's wrong Touwa-kun? No! He's okay! See you tomorrow! What the heck? Bye Bye! Hey Touwa.... Aren't you just over thinking things? That's not it! I know this. I know that Misono likes Misaki! But even if that's the case... It's just admiration isn't it? That's right! It's just admiration! Admiration! I don't think that's the case. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Hey Touwa... Why are you going after her this much? I think there's plenty of girls who would become your girlfriend. That's right! Is any other girl a no go? Well...That's the way Touwa is. It's the Zeigarnik effect. Zeigaru...meat? (Nik sounds like Niku which means meat.) No...it's the Zeigarnik effect. It's when people remember uncompleted tasks or interrupted tasks better than complete tasks. What the heck? In other words! Because you weren't able to win her over you've become interested in her right? That is true... Don't you just like her because she rejected you and you didn't win her over? No! I feel like that's not all there's to it. Hey Touwa! Hey Touwa! Just let her be. Why? Misono! Stop it. I mean...she might get harassed by another weirdo again! Later! Hold on! He's not thinking about how he's going to win her over at all! It does seem like there's a little more to it. Misono! Let's walk home together! I refuse! Again? Hey Misono! I said wait up! Misono! Why are you following me? I mean...that guy from yesterday might harass you again! I'll protect you! It's fine. We're already here. This is...your place? Hold on! Misono! Hold on! Go home already. Hey! I've made my decision! I'll confess to you everyday! Be prepared! I'm serious about you... Sorry... It's fine. I'll just tell the landlord. Later! H-Hold on! Misono! You got me!! Man, you really beat me! I'm home! Welcome home Touwa! You're home Dad? He got sent home a little earlier today. But I'll probably have to work a ton tomorrow! Let's go and eat! What are we going to eat? Yakiniku or sushi? Umm...I'm okay! You guys can go! Go on a date! A date! A date? Let's go on a long awaited date honey! A date? You don't want to? No that's... What's up with that face? Alright! Furuya? Ouch! Hey... What are you doing dummy? Ouch! Listen up. I just let you in so I could treat your injuries is all. It's fine, it's fine. You don't have to make excuses. This is your place huh? Okay! It's done! Are you a sadist? Yep! Did you go out somewhere? Yeah. My part-time job. This late at night? Isn't it like 9 o clock? Won't you get into trouble if your parents come back? They're not coming back. They always work overtime. They come back in the morning. So that means we'll be alone together? Is that...your dinner? Yeah! I get them free from my job. Do you want to eat some too Furuya? There's a lot here. Yeah! Pardon me! Thanks for the food! Once you finish that then go home. I know that! Hey...do you have any siblings? I'm an only child. Then you're the same as me! I like this band called Spicy. Do you want to hear them? Nope. Have you ever eaten a chocolate doughnut before? It's super yummy! I've never eaten it before. Have you seen that anime called "Everyday life"? Isn't it pretty crazy? I mean like there's all kinds of things living together... Hey.. Can you shut up and eat? But I mean... I want to know more and more about you! Is that what her plan is? The distance between us hasn't gotten shorter at all! Is that a painting of Midori park? My Dad was drawing illustrations for a novel but... That was his last painting. When did your Dad.... When I was nine he died of an illness. I see... It must have been tough huh? It was more difficult for my Mom. Hey Misono.. Umm.... Is it like this everyday? Do you want me to turn on the TV? N-No! That's not it! I mean...you're always alone right? Umm... I was just thinking about how it might be better to have a friend or something. I get back from work late. And nobody is going to want to hang out with me at a time like this. Misono! Hey umm... Umm... If you are okay with it.. Next time I can bring some snacks and drinks and we can hang out! It's fine. No...ummm....that's not what I meant! I'm used to this kind of life! Don't just label me as a lonely person! Misono? I'm doing just fine! Go home! That's amazing huh? Man, this meat is just sizzling! This one right here is good. I want it. Welcome home Touwa! You guys didn't go on a date? I mean...you would be lonely if you ate dinner by yourself right? Go ahead! Have a seat! Sit down. I just ate though... Don't say such lonely things. Okay? Don't you think it's been a while since we sat down and had a meal as a family? Don't you think that people were meant to be together and enjoy things as a group? That's right! That's right! You said something good! Thank you! Alright! I'll have a drink! Umm... I want to tell you guys something! Morning! I just moved in next door. I'm Touwa Furuya. Best regards! Why? It's obvious isn't it? I want to be by your side after all! Misono... The way I feel about you... Hey! Why are you here? You were thinking about me that much? Touwa-kun...I like you! Right? Isn't this the right reaction? Were you actually expecting something like that from her? Of course I was! Man...I thought I would surprise her. I wonder if it was kept a secret from her? You're such a naive dude! But it's a miracle that you moved in next to Mika though! Yeah, I just so happen to be right next door. But I'm surprised your parents let you. My Mom was totally against it but... My Dad was on my side. Well... There's that but then there's this! I got you something essential for living on your own! Here! Here's survival gear! Thank you! Open it up! What is this? What is it? Awesome! Hurry up and take it out! Amazing! So sexy! Isn't that pretty sexy? Touwa-kun has porno mags! Is that kind of thing your hobby? N-not really! I don't have an interest in it! Not at all! Not at all! What the heck? Not at all! Come on! Take your seats! Misaki... Where is Okumura sensei? He's out with a cold. I'm going to take attendance! No way... No way, no way! Mimi. Yes! Hamada. Yes! Furuya. It's just admiration...just admiration... Furuya. It's just admiration...just admiration... Furuya... Hey Furuya! What's wrong? Do you need to use the bathroom? No..t-that's not it! What the heck? Geez! Touwa-kun, you naughty boy! Do you have our money? Miwa-san! Today is the return date! You know that right? Loan sharks? Was she borrowing money? Today should be her daughter's day off! Oh crap... Oh crap! Oh crap! Oh crap! What should I do? What should I do? Open up! Open up! Open up! Open up the door damn it! Stop screwing with us and open the door! Misono! Furuya? Come here! Hurry up! You're going to act like that in this situation? You're so rude Miwa Misono! Get your ass out here! Unlock the door! Stop screwing around! Geez! I know you may hate me and I'm not dependable but... I'm the only one you have right now! Even if it's just for now...come and accept my help! Okay? I'll go first! Stay back. Open up damn it! Misono! Just a little more! What the? Your lock is broken isn't it? She ran away! Let's go! Hey... What are you doing? Hand her over to us now! Please go back! Hey! Do you wanna get your ass beat, you bastard? Please go back! Let's go back. For real? Why? Are you for real? Furuya... You're hurting me... S-s-sorry! I'm going home! What? Umm... Umm... I can make you food.. That's what I thought... You want to eat right? Let's eat! Let's eat! Oh, that's right! Umm... There's beef stew and curry....do you want to eat that? I want beef stew! My family made some for me! Umm...You can help me make the food right? Hey umm... I'm gonna say this now. But I'm just gonna eat then go okay? Which one should I use? What is this? I bought this in case I had lunch with you. Dummy! And so...that's how it went. You ate together!? You ate together? What the hell? When did you guys get so close? And then...and then! Do you wanna take a bath? Do you want to eat? Or do...want me? Something like that? What's up with that old man delusion? Hey..hey... You guys look like you're having fun. What are you talking about? It's a secret! So cool! Touwa-kun is so cool! Huh? Did you guys really just eat lunch and that was it? The composition is good. But.. You need to pay more attention to the texture of the objects too. Okay! Furuya... D-Do you need something? You're not making any progress at all! Everyone is already way ahead of you! I guess there's no helping it... You can do your best after school! Come everyday until you can do it. Your plaster statue has come! Okumura sensei. Sorry for making you go out of your way. How is Miwa doing? You're tutoring her every day right? She's not going to have any problems with her exams for next year right? No. I think she will be okay! Is that right? I'll leave her to you! Yes! I'll do my best! Do your best! Yes... Furuya...you're here? You're teaching Misono how to draw? Yeah! I'm teaching her after school before her exams. I really want her to become an artist. At her level...I have no doubt that she can get a scholarship. Hey... Misaki sensei... Do you like Misono? I like her. She's really trying her best at art. Besides...she's kind and smart... And she's very beautiful. Sometimes she can be a little reckless though. That's what you meant? What are you going to do Furuya? You're going to college right? Well...yeah. You're going to be a third year pretty soon! It's good if you have an interest in a lot of things. But...it's important to find one thing that you really want to pursue. Yeah. Hey Furuya. I'll be cheering you guys on. You can come and tell me anything at anytime. Yeah! Pardon me. Misono... Are you going to try your best again today? Yes! Alright! Please! Shall we closely examine this picture today? Yes! That's right.. The painting that's posted in the art room...that's your's right? In the future I want to do what my Dad did for a living. That's why...I want to go overseas. But my family doesn't have any money. That's why in order for me to get a scholarship I have to meet a quota. You're pretty amazing Misono! I haven't thought about my future at all. You really are amazing! I'm not amazing. I thought that it was impossible but... Sensei told me that I could do it and he gave me support. That's why I've been relying on Masaki sensei so much and I want to give him a thank you gift! I wonder what I should give him? Should I make him a homemade cake? Should I make him a cream cake? But it seems pretty difficult to do. So? What did you want to say about Misono in the DDD alliance meeting? I'm....really bad at this. We know that! Right.... So what about it? I like Misono a lot! But Misono likes Masaki... Masaki is an opponent I just can't beat! But I don't want to give up on Misono! It's fine if she thinks I'm pathetic or I'm a loser! What should I do? Please tell me! You should do that right? If you keep on trying and trying, wouldn't she fall in love with your perseverance? But I wonder what some good events are that can make her fall for you? Wouldn't they be closer to each other now that they live next door to each other? You goofed it up so bad that it's hard to come up with better situations. I'm sorry.. This is a list created by male high school students about successful confession events. Seeing the fireworks on Christmas. These are all special events done on our breaks. But all of those events ended though... In that case we have to think of something to do during school. We should do an event that's coming soon... The overnight field trip! This is perfect! It's going to be the last overnight event for the second years! And it's a better place than your home and school! Let's further develop your relationship with Misono by doing this! Alright! The important thing is placement! You definitely need to be in the same group as her! And then what? And then what? A barbecue! I can cook the meat! I can do the vegetables! The vegetables! Thanks for the food! How is it? It's yummy! Really? Yeah! Thank goodness! This is a Furuya chicken recipe. There's miso inside. Is that right? Yeah! And then...when you put the miso in there then it is way more yummy! Thanks for the meal! I'll wash the dishes! I can do it after I take you home. No, this is for the yummy soup! I'll help you out! Okay! I'll take this! Thanks! What is it? Doesn't this seem like we're living together? Are you stupid? Here! Alright! What is that? The overnight field trip is coming up soon you see? I'm going to make yummy bentos! It's gonna be fun! What should I make? Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you gonna do if we're in the same group? The same. Hey... This is about the overnight field trip... She's not gonna be going to the field trip?! Why not? Well...I asked her for the reason too... She just said "Anyways, I'm not going to participate!" For real? How is it going Miwa? I can't get the same colors as my Dad no matter what. There's no need for you to paint just like your Dad right? You need to paint the way that you paint. Okay! You and your Dad...you both like this kind of feel. For his daughter to love the same place as he did... I think that would make him very happy. I'm sure of it. That might not be the case... No.. It's nothing! You're late! It's not enough! I'm sorry... Misono... There's no helping it. Tell your Mommy to pay up! Okay! Later! The hell you doing? What is it? Hey... Come with me! I've known Misono and her daughter for almost 6 years now. Her mother borrowed money from a lot of places and started drowning in debt. And she came to people like us. Umm...why is Misono's Mom in debt? Her husband died of a brain tumor. Nobody thought that her husband would die so soon. She tried to cope with her husband's death. And while she was out buying all kinds of stuff she got buried in debt. Ever since then it's been a tough battle. She's trying her best but... She can't do it. Her debt is way too high. It's not enough for her to work alone. Her daughter is doing all she can to endure it and she's even working. And she's paying back the debt. That's why she... What is it? What are you going to do? Is there anything a high school student can do? Later. Hold on please! Home delivery! It's yummy so eat it! From now on you may feel a little bit lonely but... I'll make you soup everyday alright? Heat it up then eat it! I'm not lonely. Thanks for the food! It was yummy. Ready, set, go! Sorry about that! For real? And then he was like... Morning Misono! Hey... Yes! Alrighty! What's wrong? What's wrong? Hey, hey... He's asleep! So cute!! Cute... Well he is Touwa-kun! Finally.... I finally got it! Just you wait Misono! Oh Furuya... What's wrong? Sensei.. I want to talk to you about something. Is that right? Can you wait 30 minutes? Yeah! Thanks for waiting. I wonder if you could help me out during the overnight field trip? You could say that you would be a teacher assistant. Misono... It would be a big help if you could do some stuff for me. You'll be doing jobs that will prepare for the trip..so you don't have to pay the fees for the trip. How about it? Will you help me out? Thanks for the offer. But...I'm okay! Hold on. Listen Miwa... There's no need for you to think like that. You're still a high school student after all. Don't hold back like an adult. Sensei... Furuya? What's wrong? It's nothing... Come to my house. It's fine... What are you going to do if you get a cold? Just come over! Furuya...I have medicine. He looks like Masaki doesn't he? He looks like him. Your Dad looks like Masaki. I wonder? What's up with all of this? Furuya? Hey... Pay attention to me. Misono... Don't make that kind of face... You're hot! Are you okay? Let's eat...together... The two of us.. Huh? Mi-mi-misono!? Furuya... You're awake? Well... You wouldn't let go of my hand no matter what. You should have gone to your house before you collapsed. No..well..umm... S-s-s-s-sorry! Misono..I... It's fine. Even though I had to take care of you when you had a fever. Misono... You're going to take the day off school right? Hurry up and sleep in your own room. I already told the teacher. It's still pretty high... We slept together the entire time... Oh crap...I'm super super happy! Umm... What is it? You sure do have a nice boyfriend. You're able to participate in the school trip right? Even though he's handsome he's pretty awkward isn't he? Let's start the King game! Number 5 and 18 need to spin three times then bark like a dog! One...two...three...bark! Butt writing! Write siri with your butt! Since this is the King game, there needs to be "that"! Number 7 and number 15 need to kiss! Oh, that's me! Who is the other one? The other one? Here, here, here! It's Misono! Misono... Kiss...kiss...kiss! Kiss...kiss..kiss.. What are you doing?! I mean...I didn't think it would be those two! Okay, okay! Knock it off! What are we going to do? I don't know bro! I get it already! That's fine isn't it? Over here! Over here! What? Touwa..what are you gonna do? About what? We're talking about Miwa obviously! Are you okay with the adult Masaki taking her away from you? Alright! The starry sky confession! The starry sky confession? But hasn't he been confessing to her this whole time? It's just been random confessions so far right? You will be at an unknown place in the night... The stars will be engulfing the sky... You two will be alone...the mood would be set... Is there a girl who wouldn't fall for you if you said you liked her in that situation? There's not! There's not! Maybe there will be a shooting star too! A shooting star? Girls love this kind of thing! You will be the victor in this duel! This will be an amazing confession... Go forward soldier! I understand! This will be the best confession yet! I'll go all out! Alright! Alright! Okay!! Is everyone here? Yes! Alright, you guys need to climb the hill on the lookout... Then record the constellation that you see. Come back in an hour! You need to record it. Make sure you go with her! Everyone ready? Yeah! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Look closely! Look closely! Go for it bro! Do your best! Touwa! Go! Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Furuya... Let's go! Misono! We're all alone huh? That's true. You're not cold? I'm okay! Oh that's right! Wanna drink some coffee? No, it's okay. Hey! Misono! Umm... I... Hey Furuya... Aren't we lost? Where are we? C-calm down Misono! If we just retrace our steps... Then we can get back! I'm not the one freaking out Furuya! You need to calm down! I know that! We shouldn't have gone too far off the route. If we go through here... It's okay! Alright! You're pretty tired aren't you? I'm okay! I'm okay... Shall we take a break? Let's do that. Sorry Misono... I really am no good... No...that's not true. I mean...look! The starry sky is beautiful! Hey Furuya... I heard about it. You were working weren't you? So that I could go on this overnight field trip. I didn't even ask you to but you went so far out of your way to do it. You really are a dummy aren't you? Furuya. That's true! But..I was so happy. Thanks a lot! Furuya. Hey... I wonder if we're gonna see a shooting star? Hey Misono. I'm going to take back all those confessions I made everyday. I've realized that half-assed words don't have much meaning. The shooting star didn't come yet and I couldn't confess to her... It's everyone! Let's go! For some reason...even if it was a little bit... I felt like I got closer to Misono. Hamada! Yes! Furuya! Yes! Oshima! Yoshida! Yes! Ready, go! He did it! He got a good score! You guys are going to be third years! We do have a little break but... Do your best when you come back! Yes... Also...I have some very unfortunate news. Even though Masaki sensei truly cherished this class...he has decided to leave this school. Why? It's a family emergency. His Dad hasn't been doing well. He's going to go back to his hometown in Hokkaido. Misono! Are you okay? I'm okay! Hey! Hey! Hey! What should we get? This soft egg omelet looks really yummy huh? What the heck? Hurry up and decide! Hey... There's that dish right? The chicken one.. Wow! Look at that! This beef steak is 1080 yen! Let's get that! How about this one? Let's do that one please. Thank you! Thank you! Dad... Today is the 8th anniversary huh? All the people that I love...they end up leaving me. Am I going to be all alone again? Pardon me. You came? This is yours. Hold these. Also.... This too! It's a brush that I've used but...you can use it if you'd like. Okay. I'll take good care of it. Even though I'm leaving... Everything will be okay if I leave like this. Do your best Miwa. Yes. Misono! I can hold these for you! It's okay! I want to go home alone today. I understand... Pardon me. Thank you. Be safe. Yes! Pardon me. Hey sensei... I want to be you. Furuya? When I become an adult... Will I be able to do anything for the sake of the person I like? And then..the day of the graduation ceremony came. Misono! Morning! Misono? Misono? What's wrong? I feel.. Misono? You have a bad fever! Misono... Do you need to go to the hospital? I have taken medicine.. Today is Masaki's last day too... I'm always like this... I can't tell the people important to me my inner thoughts... I got into a stupid fight with my Dad... And he died before I was able to apologize to him... Misono... Please... I understand.. I understand! If things get really bad then give me a phone call right away! Okay? You have a lot of duties as students. Not only do you study hard but you participate in club activities too. Today is the graduation ceremony for you third years. I hope you will take care of your health and welcome a new school year. Now then...I would like to allow Masaki sensei who is leaving this year to say his goodbyes. Everyone! Thank you for everything. I hope you will continue to work toward your goals and dreams. I really loved this school... This time, I have to leave because of personal reasons but... I have seen the scenery of this school and your smiles. It is a treasure I will have forever. I believe you will have a bright future. You have learned many things from here and have met many comrades. Believe in yourselves! Hey Sensei... When I become an adult... Will I be able to do anything for the sake of the person I like? Adults can't do anything. You just have to decide things on your own. I think that you guys can do way more than what I can do. We can do anything? Furuya? Let's go! You like Masaki don't you? Confess to him! Are you okay with letting him go like this? I know that you are very sick but.. You have to tell the people important to you how you feel! I'll take you there! Alright? Furuya... You need to tell Masaki all of your feelings! Be careful. One step at a time. Are you cold? Touwa! Guys... Masaki still hasn't left yet! He said he still has time before his flight! Use this! My Dad let me borrow this from the hospital! Get her on fast! Are you okay? Be careful. Will we make it? We'll make it! That's true! Hang on tight! Let's go! Are you okay Misono? Hey! My Dad is going to be pissed at me! It's fine! He's going to be mad at us all! Misono! Get on my back! Hurry up! Let's go! He's going to leave soon! Go! Go! Go for it! Thanks guys... Hurry and go! Go get him! Go!! Go for it! Go for it! Do your best! It's okay. We'll definitely get there! Misono... It's snow! Where is he at? Where are you Masaki? Alright! Let's go! Where's Masaki? Masaki... There he is! Masaki... I'm sorry! Shit! It's okay! I'll definitely find him! Masaki... Where are you? There he is! Masaki! Furuya... Can you walk? Miwa? Thanks...Furuya... Whatever, just go! Sensei! Miwa! Are you okay? Yes! There's something important that I want to tell you! Sensei... I...I liked you! Thanks to these feelings I was able to come here! Thanks...a lot! Thanks Miwa. I'm happy that I was able to help you choose the path that you wanted to take. Later... The people that I love...always end up leaving me. Am I going to be all alone again? I'll become your Dad! I'll be your older brother! Your younger brother! I'll become your dog or whatever you want! That's why...you'll never be alone. I'll be with you forever after all! Furuya.... I..think I probably loved sensei like a father. You're the one who made me realize that. Dad! I've fall in love with Furuya too! I like you...Furuya! You're lying! It's true! You're lying! I told you it's the truth! Yep! That's a lie! It's true! That's definitely a lie! I mean...you told me that you would be anything I wanted you to be. Well...yeah! Go for it! Then...you're my dog! Please take care of me! Okay. I'll become your dog. But a dog might become a wolf though. You'll get my cold... That's fine.
