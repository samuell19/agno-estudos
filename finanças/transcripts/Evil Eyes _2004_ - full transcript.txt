Bob Brup's Office. Hey Justin, is Bob in? It's Jeff. Jeff? Stenn. I think he stepped out. Let me put you on hold. No no no. Don't. C'mon, I know he's there. Don't... Don't put me on hold. Bob Brup's office. Hey Justin. Matt Perry for Bob. Hey Matt. Hold on for me. Yeah, Mattster, what's up? Hey Bob, it's Jeff. Look, I'm on my way out the door. Look, I'm just following up on that Dreamworks project. What's up? Jeff, I hate to say it, but they didn't want to meet with you. Why not? C'mon. After what you did. You're untouchable. What are you talking about? In fact, until this clears up, I'm gonna have to drop you. Wait. Didn't you say I was the best writer to hit LA since Faulkner? You said that. What the fuck are you doing over there? Look, I got to go. It's not going to last forever. Hollywood's got a short memory. I can't help it that I'm true to my vision. God. Fuck me. It's just a game. It's not the game, Pete. I'm gonna lose my house. Well, what does Tree say? You didn't tell her? Can you borrow the money from your folks? Yeah. Right. You'll get work. It'll change. They'll forget about the incident. I just got to get Gambit to produce the film. If I get Gambit to produce, I could be hot again, be raking it in. You got a good agent. Can't you help him out? Yeah, I'll put in a good word for you with Marilyn. My agent. She might not be taking anyone on, but hey, you never know, right? You'd do that? Yeah. You give her a call? Yeah. Next week. Same time. Hey. Hey you. Come here, you. Miss me? It's been like four hours. I found your cap. Yeah, I was looking for the red one though. Looks really cute on you though. You got a phone call today. Yeah. From George Truman. Who's this? He's a producer from True Films. You heard of him? No. Jeff Stenn. Please sit down. Erica. One coffee for Herr Stenn. I'm sorry, Jeff, about the office. We're just moving in. It's a bit in disorder. Thanks. No it's... Are these yours? Yeah. Art movies. Festival stuff. But I got a new partner. We want to do something more commercial, and we think that you are the right man to write it. How'd you find me? Jeff. Channels, connections. But that's not important. You have a certain quality. But we need for the story, Jeff, a certain quality. Truth? Right. You see, you said the right thing at the right time. That's what I like. So what is this story anyway? Erica. Here's the story. Jeff, don't open it now. Read it at home, and then you tell me what you think about it. I could tell you how I think the story should go, but I'd rather wait for you to tell me. What's the budget? Three million. I know it's a low budget, but we still can make a quality picture. Well, I'll take a look through this and get back to you. I hope I hear from you soon. Okay. Soon, Jeff. Soon. Hey. Hey. What is this? Like a true crime thing? Check it out. About this guy named Gary Gramm. Apparently he killed a bunch of people about 30 years ago, then he killed himself. Thought he was an angel of death. I think it may be a musical, dramedy. Not sure yet. I thought you didn't want to do this kind of crap for other people. I know. We need the money, though. After that, I can concentrate more on what I want to do. If you want, I can go back to work. No. You're not going back to work. I want you in the kitchen. Barefoot and pregnant, as always. Except for the pregnant part. That was funny. We can work on that. Yeah. What? Funny or the pregnant? So, did you like the script? I'll do it. Splendid, Jeff. Splendid. What, do you have any ideas? Tell me. Well, I thought maybe a descent into madness, psychological thriller with surreal overtones. Great. And Lynchian undertones. Lynching? No. Lynchian. David Lynch. Yeah, of course, but why don't you make it mysterious, psycho? I want it as soon as possible. Look, I'll have my lawyer draw up the contract, and you get your first share in a week? What about that? Deal. Almost forgot. You need this. Go and do your research. Live it. Great, Jeff. I'm really thrilled. Hey Nina, what's up? I wanted to see if you're going to come out with us this Friday night. Give me a call. Bye girl. Hi honey, it's Mom, calling to see how you are. Call me when you hear this. Bye. Hey Nina. It's Jeff. You know, I'm working on a new script, I thought maybe you'd like to help out. It's a crime scene drama, and I know how you like those. Anyway, the address is 129 South Holland Street. I'll be there around five. Hope to see you there. Okay bye. Hey. Jesus. Hey. Thanks for coming. Yeah, you know I'm a crime scene junkie. Glad to help you get your fix. Let's check it out. So, the mom was electrocuted, and what happened to the others? He killed them with an axe. Well, why didn't he use an axe on the mother, then? I don't know. Maybe he thought it was more humane to electrocute her with a toaster. I'm not a killer. Well, you better start thinking like one. You're writing this thing. Gorgeous. Go ahead. How'd you get this gig? A guy who read my first script. Jam? Yeah. I thought you didn't send that one out. Hey, will you come over and help me with the script tonight? Please. I need your help. Just like old times. Is it okay with Tree? Yeah. Come on, she loves you. Need a hand? No, I'm set. I'll make some coffee. Thanks baby. That was an amazing dinner. She's perfect. I use to wonder what it would take to get you to settle down. You know, I'd almost hate her if I didn't actually like her, you know? So when am I gonna see the place populated with little Jeffs? Well, believe it or not, that's actually not out of the realm of possibility. So when do I get my fix? So this guy was a director? You didn't tell me that. So we should check out some of his films. We can't. He only made one. He never finished it. Why not? That's what we're trying to find out? Would you like some coffee, Nina? No thanks. I got my wine. So what's up with this dead actress on the highway? Did he kill her, too? This is where it gets weird. All that you ever do is you just, rant and rave, and you're so jealous, and I just can't be with you anymore. I mean, you just need to stop. Can you pull over the car? Just pull over because I want out. Just let me out. They filmed this scene a week before the actors in it died. That's a weird coincidence. You think that maybe he pushed her or rigged it or something? No, the police ruled it accidental. It gets even weirder. Great party man. That's Peg, the wife. Hey, this party's grueling. You known him for long? Long? Been here a while? I've heard that one before. You are a beautiful girl. I'm telling you, man. Wait, let me get this straight. You really think you can do this? You think by writing something or filming it that you're making it happen? Yeah, man. Creativity. It unlocks some dark forces in the universe. Sometimes... It unleashes a power. Sometimes just by imagining something, you actually make it happen. Guy's hot. Goodnight, sweetie. You're not gonna stay up long, are you? No, I won't be long. Nina's pretty drunk. She is? I can't tell. That's 'cause you are too. I'm not drunk. Just make her stay on the couch. Okay? Night night. Hey. I got it. What about a scene where the guy and the girl say goodbye, and the girl drives off to her doom and leaves the guy standing there, and we see that his eyes are red like the devil's? Devil's eyes aren't red, they're you're color. I love it. That's very, very funny. You should stay here tonight. You had too much to drink. Thanks anyway. I'll be fine. I know it's not a bed. I'll get some fresh sheets. You should stay here. Wait. Yes? Is Nina there? Who is this? I called you. Who's this? You're not allowed in here. Hey Tree, it's mom. I was calling to check on Jeff. Just wanted to see how he's holding up. Call me later. Hey, missed you at the game. I know you're probably still upset about Nina, but it's been three weeks. You've got to move on. Jeff, how's the script coming along? My investors are starting to worry. Honey, you have to try to go on. She would want you to. I can't. I just keep seeing it over and over in my mind. It's not your fault. That's exactly the scene I was writing right when it happened that same night. It's like I made it happen. Jeff, honey, people always blame themselves when bad things happen. But you know what? Bad things always happen. Yeah, but I was writing that exact scene. Listen to what you're saying. Hello? Yes, just a second. It's for you. Listen Mr. Truman, I was hoping I could get an extension. I don't know if I can work on this right now. Work is the best thing for it, Jeff. But I have to tell you, I found new investors, and the budget is moving up. Maybe to five or seven millions. Of course your salary will move up too. Well, that's great. But there is a little right issue. Rights? Yeah. We want to make it all about Gramm, but you see, not really about him. What I mean is, not recognizable about him. You understand what I'm saying? Jeff, also the new partner is thinking less psycho thriller. More horror. Blood. Cuts. Knives. You know the kid stuff. So grosser? Exactly. I want to see what you are writing. What you have done so far. Well, I normally don't like to share work that's incomplete. I don't know I... I'm sorry, Mr. Truman. I'm just not sure that this is the kind of project I should be working on right now. It's a little... dark. But you are good at dark. It's in your nature. Jeff, have fun with it. That's brilliant. That's fucking brilliant. That is the stupidest shit I've ever fucking seen. Call an ambulance. My God. God. Somebody call an ambulance! Hey. Hey. Thanks. You're welcome. You know, I don't think he was crazy. I think he was telling the truth. Who? Gramm. Look Gramm, this is not the time or the place, okay? Come here, you should be filming this. What the fuck are you talking about? Look, man, it's not my fault. They were gonna pull you. You're blowing the schedule. Replace me? It's my script. My vision. Who are they gonna get? Look, the only two people who know the story are me and you. Who are they gonna get? They didn't ask you to direct, did they? Fuck you! I don't get it. Well, this tape was done right before Bryce had his accident. Jeff. Good morning. What time is it? It's quarter to ten. God. No. No no no no. I've gotta be there now. Will you... Will you put that in a cup? I gotta go in the car. Gosh. Shit. Thank you. Thank you. Jeff, I must say, I love what you did with it. How you changed it, updated it. Made it an accident outside instead of film studio, director, with a camera falling off the ladder. How sad. But it needs some more... How should I say it? Fine tuning. Fine tuning. Tweaking? No, you need to feel his anger. You know? His anger for the accident of his friend. Really, that's what we need. Keep working on it, Jeff. You're going the right direction. It's great. It's good to have you back, man. It's good to be back, I tell ya. Hey Jeff man. Welcome back. Good to be back. Peter, congratulations man. I just heard. For what? He didn't tell you? That movie, that Dreamworks movie. Peter got it. Dead End? Yeah. You got Dead End? Yeah, purely a coincidence. I was with my agent, and the Dreamworks acquisitions guy came over to borrow pickles and... That's the big time. Dreamworks. Amazing. That's wonderful, Peter. Congratulations. Thanks. Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Yeah yeah. Fine. What's that? It's your sweatshirt. Thanks, but today's colors are blue. Play ball. You got Dead End? Yeah, it was just pure coincidence, man. My agent and I were at Night and Owl's, and the Dreamworks acquisitions guy came over to borrow pickles and that was it. That's wonderful, Peter. Congratulations. You're not angry at me or anything for getting? No. I'm happy for ya. Call an ambulance! Get an ambulance! My God. What the fuck? I'm not a killer. Well, you better start thinking like one. You're gonna like it, sweetie. It's fine. It's only for a short time. Look babe, I know it's not much, but being here is really gonna help me write. I need you here with me. If you don't like it, you can go home, but please. It's not that bad. So what do you think? I kind of like it actually. I don't know. It feels like home. Really? Yes. What are you doing? Well, I thought the other room would be better. This one's a little freaky. No, I love this room. Let the other one be the guest room. Let's stay here. Really? Yeah. Okay. As long as it doesn't bother you. How's it goin'? It's not. What's the block? Motive. Okay, so imagine Gramm entering the kitchen and his mother-in-law is standing right here. He takes the toaster and drops it into the water, electrocuting her. Then he grabs an axe, went into the bathroom where he hacks the father-in-law to death. Then into the bedroom. Then he comes into the bedroom and uses the same axe on his pregnant wife. Pregnant? What happened to the baby? No. There's no fetal death certificate for anyone named Gramm, on or around that date. What does that mean? That the baby survived? Maybe there was no birth record because it was adopted. Adopted. He'd be about 35 now. 36? My age. Why did you do it? I didn't. You did. Take it. They said the splinters cut off the oxygen to his brain. I'm Marilyn Cresden. You're his agent, yeah? Well technically, but I like to consider myself more than that. I didn't catch your name. Jeff. Stenn. The writer. Peter spoke very highly of you. What are you working on? It's a horror thing for True Films. Let me give you my card. Send me your script when you're finished. I'd love to take a look at it. I'm here to see Marilyn. She isn't taking any appointments today. Jeff Stenn. Go right in. Jeff, come in. I'm glad you agreed to come in. You know it was the strangest coincidence. After you mentioned George Truman of True Films... Well, I met him the next day, and we got to talking about you. And Jeff, he let me see some of that horror script you been working on. I love it. I love it, and I think Dreamworks would love it too. Dreamworks? Absolutely. Absolutely. I think it has just the quality they're looking for for Dead End. And with all the publicity we've been getting lately... Jeff Stenn, screenwriter, friend of the accident victim. Timing couldn't be better. Although, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. So, does that mean you're gonna represent me? Well, you still have to finish it. Otherwise George will be very unhappy. Right George? That's right. First things first. So where are we on the script? Page 49. Fabulous. But there's a slight change in concept, Jeff. Change? The new investors, they wanted... Bigger? Yes, Jeff. For ten millions budget there comes effects. Earthquakes, supernatural like. He's the angel of death, the devil's son. You know? Tidal waves hits LA. Can't you see it? But that isn't how it happened. Are you so sure? You remember that earthquake tragedy in Mexico '71? Hundreds of people died, Jeff. Are you saying that Gramm was there then? That he willed it? I don't want to say anything, but it's possible. He took a vacation just before it happened. Think about it. Think about the guilt. Jeff. Listen, it's just the same. It is just bigger. Bigger? More death. In Mexico. Honey, why don't you come inside and eat? I'm not hungry. Okay, well, I left something for you on the table. You need to eat. Tree, did you feel that? Wake up. What is it? It was an earthquake. Did you feel that jolt? Probably just a truck passing. That was an earthquake. I don't understand, I set it in Mexico. What are you talking about? It's not your fault, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You can't make things happen by putting them in a movie. Was talking to himself. Are you just trying to deny your own dangerous power? Because otherwise you'd have to quit the film. You can't quit the film. Somehow everything depends on the film. What's this? Remember I told you I had something to tell you? What? We might be needing that minivan. You're pregnant? We talked about kids before. You said you wanted children. What's wrong? It's in the script. Forget the script. We're not being controlled by the script. Can't risk it. Jeff wait. Listen. You're worried, right? About the accidents. But Jeff, when Gramm killed his wife it wasn't an accident. We don't know what put him over the edge. Whatever it was, it's not gonna happen to us. You'd never willingly hurt me, right? No. Never. We're gonna be okay. Yeah. Yeah, we'll be okay. What don't you do a test? Write something and see if it happens. What do you think I've been doing? If you have this power, you can make things happen, so write something. Make something bad happen. I don't want bad things to happen to people. Isn't there someone, whom you might get pleasure from writing a scene about? This is crazy. I can't do this. Honey, is that you? Yeah. Were you just in the bedroom? No, I haven't moved. That's funny. I thought I felt you there. Have you been working all night? Why did he do it? Why did he do it? The truth is there, I just need to see it. Jeff, he just went crazy. There has to be a reason. Maybe Peg was cheating on him. What? Why would you say that? Isn't that the standard reason? Jeff. Is she cheating on me? Peg, are you cheating on me? Peg, I love you. How could you? I have to... Naw, that's ridiculous. Pregnant women don't cheat. It'll be perfect. Great. I love it. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. It'll be perfect. I love it. That's so right. Yeah. Honey, phone's for you. It's Greg. He called? I didn't hear the phone ring. I was on the other line. Here, take it. Yeah, buddy boy? Yeah, I'll be there. Later. You two seemed to be having a nice conversation. He went to visit Peter. He said he's doing better. Well, I better get back to work. Okay. How's it going buddy? Yeah? Jeffster, how are you? Hey Bob. Hey listen, don't ask me how I did it, but I did it. You're hot again, baby. Why don't you come into the office and make an appointment, and maybe we can talk about stuff. Well, I'm kind of busy right now. What? I didn't hear you. I have new representation, Bob. A minor issue. Why don't you come to the office and we can have a sit down? Give Sally a call. A lot of buzz, baby. A lot of buzz. Fuck. Hold on. Bob's Brup's office. Yeah, Bob Brup. I was just on the phone with him. It's Jeff Sten. He's not taking any calls. Dick. So I'll see you back at home? Okay. Drive safely. Hey Jeff. Can you give me a life home? How about it? Yeah, sure. Get in. Thanks bro. No problem. Hey. Where you been? I went to pick up your dry cleaning, but it wasn't ready. Are you hungry? No. So honey, I was thinking. You really should visit Peter this weekend. You haven't seen him in weeks. Yeah, sure. That's a good idea. You wanna come with? No. I'd love to. I have cooking class though. You sure you don't wanna come? Of course I wanna come, but I gotta keep my chops up for my man. Yeah, well, okay. See you later. How you doing, bud? Okay. How you doing, man? I'm... getting out of here soon. Sure you are, bud. Did we win? The game? No man. They called the game. Hey. I'm gonna... I'm gonna go, Pete. I'll come back and visit you soon. Okay? Hey Jeff, can you give me a ride home? I'll be outside in a second. Hey. Hey. How are you, baby? I'm good. You look wonderful. Hey, how you doin'? I'm your neighbor. Hi. Yeah, I was wondering if I could borrow your axe? Axe? I don't think we have an axe. Yeah, you got one in the garage. I know the landlord. You definitely got one. Okay. Come in. Thanks. That tremor last night took down a couple of my branches. So how's the script coming? Well, I hear it's getting a real buzz around town. Marilyn seems to really like you. Listen, I have to say something. I want to do something. The way things worked out with Peter, I think I... What do you mean? Well, Marilyn's interested in me, my writing, because of what happened with Peter, and I think... Jeff, it's not your fault. Okay? I mean, you're a good writer. Peter loves you. He would only want good things to happen for you. If I get this deal with Dreamworks, I want to give you guys some. No, just forget it. No, I won't. I'm not gonna. So did you figure out an ending yet? I can't figure out why he did it. She probably cheated on him. What? Why would you say that? No reason. I mean, isn't that the classic reason? Yeah, but he killed three people. Why would I do that? What did you just say? Why would he do that? No, you just said "Why would I do that?" I didn't. Why the fuck would I say that? Okay. Could you just take me home? Man. Feel better now? Yeah, a lot better. Everything's great. I'm going back to Kiddo tomorrow. What about the Angel of Death script? I'm finishing it tonight. So afterwards are we going back home? Yes. Let's get out of here tomorrow. Okay? I don't believe it. Jeffrey. Jeffrey? What is this? That's the script. Jeff. It has everything you asked for. It has the accidents. Gore and blood. I guess I should have listened to people. You never finish what you started, Jeff. What are you talking about? Lawsuit. Why your agent dropped you. Jeff. Don't make this your last script. It's the best I can do. I mean... What do you want me to do? Very simple. Make them die. Violently. You know, people start asking about you in town again. My good friends. Dreamworks. They're very interested in you, and they're considering you for guess what? Dead End. They are? Really? Yes. Yes. Yes, Jeff. But of course I told them how thrilled I was working with you. Of course I was before. You know, you better finish the script. I paid you, Jeffrey. You have to finish the script. You know, make Gramm explain why. Gramm killed his wife, and his family. Make it more violent. Make it true. Real. So... True slaughter. Jeff, I thought you were finished with the script. I thought we were leaving today. Where is it? Where is it? Jane Rolf. That's it, she'd know about my adoption. Who's that? That's Gramm's sister. You're not adopted, Jeff. How do you know? I don't look anything like my parents. It would explain everything. Even if you were, what makes you think you're Gramm's son? I don't know. It's a feeling. That has to be it. Listen, what about me? Look, I never told you, but I was adopted. Okay. Just because I'm adopted, doesn't mean I'm the child of the Angel of Death. Thousands of people are adopted. Yeah, I know, but if I'm connected to everything, it explains it all. It explains everything. Jeff, please. Give this up. Operator. Los Angeles, California. Jane Rolf. It's a residence. R-O-L-F You have reached the Rolf residence. We're are not in. Please leave a message. Hello. Yes, Miss Rolf, this is Jeff Stenn. I don't know if you're Gary Gramm's sister, but if you are, I need you to call me as soon as possible. Honey, come out to the back yard for a second. Please. Surprise! Congratulations Jeff! We came all the way from Phoenix for your party. Now that our son-in-law's a big motion picture writer. Congratulations Jeff. Dreamworks loves your work. You're hired. Are you surprised? They love my work, but I've never submitted anything. Hello? Jeffrey? George Truman. Congratulations. I just want to tell you I love the script. The final draft has everything. It was all there. Wasn't it, Jeffrey? Final draft? Well, it's final to me. It is spectacular. Yeah, well thanks. You know, Steven at Dreamworks. He loves it. He's even thinking of auctioning it. In fact, Jeffrey, I'd love to work with you again. I don't know what to say. Why, I think we are a great team, you and I. When did I send you that draft, again? I know. I'm sorry I didn't call you earlier after your e-mail. I love your script, just like everybody else, Jeff. Congratulations. Get a drink. Get some champaign. Enjoy the party. This is for you and Tree. Cheers. I know this might sound a little odd, but can I ask you a favor? Congratulations. Did you read it? Of course. The ending is a kicker. Hello. Hello. Jeff Stenn, please. This is he. This is Jane Gramm Rolf. What's this about? You said something about Gramm's baby. Yeah. I... I wanted to know what happened to him. Him? I think I might be Gramm's child. You're not, Mr. Stenn. I can guarantee that. Why were you convinced you were Gramm's child? Just strange things seem like they've been happening. What kind of strange things? I can't explain. Mr. Stenn, there is nothing to worry about. The baby wasn't a son. It was a daughter. And there's one other thing about the child. Protanomaly. Do you know what that is, Mr. Stenn? A particular kind of color blindness. Very rare. One of of a hundred males might have it. For women it might be one out of a thousand. Also known as red weakness. For the afflicted, red hues are shifted. It appears to them as green. Gramm's daughter has it, Mr. Stenn. It's beautiful. Thanks Mom. It'll do bagels too. Don't worry about the dishes. Leave them for tomorrow. Bill. Tree, we need to talk. What is it, Mom? Do you know who this is? I don't think it would be good for this to get out. Can you see the headlines? Mother! - It's not proper. We worked so hard, the script's written. You can't undo that. Hollywood does not work that way. We'll talk when Jeff gets back. He'll understand. It's bad for the family. He's a reasonable young man. No, Mother. Why didn't you tell me this? Tree, what good would it have done, you knowing that? What good? Look what's happened now. It's because of you. What's happening now is we're preventing a disaster. Imagine what people will say when they find out that you, your husband are profiting from this. Calm down and think about it. Calm down? You don't understand Jeff. What will happen when he finds out? He'll understand. I'll lose him. No you won't. No more argument. Everybody needs to calm down. We'll finish this when Jeff gets back. We're a family. End of discussion. Tree. Jeff. I figured it out. What? That it was you. What? That you finished the script. Me? No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. I didn't. You finished it. You turned it in. No. I know you did. Tree. Open the door, honey. This won't take long. What color is this side? Color? Yeah, what color is it? It's yellow. What about this side? It's green. I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. You did everything. You're Gramm's daughter. You knew my script. We had an earthquake. You wrote this. Jeff, you can't make things happen. Listen to me, sweetie. Yes you can. I'll tell you how it happened. It's not true. It's in the script. Your script. Jeff, you can't make things happen by writing them. No, I can't, but you can. I didn't write the script. You wrote it. No I didn't. No. Don't you remember all those hours? You solved it. I did it. I solved it. That's great, baby. I'm proud of you. No, you wrote it. Say it! Say it. Okay. I wrote it. Okay. I want the truth. What do you want me to say? I want you to tell me the truth. Just stop it, baby. Baby please. Stop, and think about what you're doing. I am, honey. I am. You're doing that. I didn't. I can't control it. It just happens. It's getting stronger. It's growing in me. What happened? No. No no no no no. Creativity. It unlocks some dark forces in the universe. Sometimes... It unleashes a power. Sometimes, just by imagining something, you actually make it happen. This is what we like to refer to as our miracle baby. I won't go into any detail, but by all accounts she should be dead, but she's healthy, strong. She's a fighter. She's gonna do something big. Go ahead. Pick her up. Here's the story. Take it home, and let me know what you think about it.
