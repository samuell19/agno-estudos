This is Aidan. It's day 42. Um... I'm sorry... 'cause I tried. Hello? Hello?! Oh, cool. Mmm, come to papa. Come on, honey. Come on. The following message is being transmitted at the request of the Office of Civil Defense. This is an emergency broadcast. This isn't a test. Jesus. Oh, my God. Jeez... Hurry up, run! - Run! - Run. Help me! Hey! Hey, sweetheart! It's okay. I'm going to come get... Somebody's gonna come get... Whoa! No! Jesus! - Whoa! - Whoa! Hey! Hey! - What's... - It's okay... Hey, hey, hey. - I'm your neighbor! - Get... get out of my apartment! - I'm your neighbor! - Get the fuck out! You know my face! Okay? You've seen me before. You know me! I live next door. I'm Brandon. Please... Please. Help me! Help! What are you doing in here? The door was unlocked. Yeah, why are you in my apartment? - What... - Something's happening. Yeah, no shit! Why are you in here?! Are you alone? Just what is going on? My roommate attacked me. And I've known him since the fifth grade. Oh, God! Major cities in complete chaos! Infected people are extremely dangerous! We're seeing bleeding from the eyes, screaming. We're also seeing cannibalism. The virus is being transmitted through the blood, primarily through bites, scratches. Uh, the amount of... The following message is being transmitted at the request of the Office of Civil Defense. I'm not that. I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay... Don't make me go out there. - No! - I'm sorry. - I'll die! - I can't help you here. You have to leave. Dude! Oh, no! No! Get the hell out! Get out! I'm sorry. Go. Go! Tommy! Tommy! Somebody! We're starting to see some instances of groups of people... Well, groups of people fighting back. We do not encourage this. Certainly, if you are attacked, you should defend yourself. But what we have seen so far, the best way to survive, to avoid infection, to avoid being a part of spreading the infection, is to just completely avoid contact. Find a place to hide and stay there. Hopefully, it won't have to be for too long. We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and... Get away! Somebody help me! What? What's happening? All circuits are currently busy. Please try again later. Help! I love that they put this guy in the lead-off spot. I mean, he hits everything. Look at him. They can't get the ball past him. On top of that, he hits for power. This is great. So, in the absence of a biological imperative, we learned that there could be a psychological driver that makes infected people only willing to eat what's alive and not infected. There are chemical changes happening that are impacting brain function significantly. Observation would tell you that rage and shame are both at work in a very big way. The wireless customer you called is not available. So if you're thinking about rationing food, that's smart. But you also need to be thinking about your water. We've still got running water here for now, but we're starting to hear from other major metropolitan areas that they are losing access. And a human being can survive up to three weeks without food, but water is more like three days. Leave me alone! Hi! Um, this is my first video log, I guess. I-I think it's recording. Um, my name is Aidan. And it's been seven days since this started. Uh, the news is calling it a global pandemic. I've been alone since day one. Which is weird because I've... never been by myself more than a day in my entire life. So... And I can't leave. And the phones are... Stay away! Can you hear that? It's... It's constant. All the time. And, uh... And I'm, um... um... I'm trying to, uh... Now, there are two things going wrong in an infected brain. The first is that the reptilian brain becomes hypersensitive, particularly in the areas that control anger and aggression. Triggered, as we have seen, by contact with the uninfected living things. That when the reptilian brain is engaged, it suppresses the natural activity of the frontal cortex. Not enough to affect action, but enough to... To scream. Yes, and cause involuntary movement. Um, although involuntary movements is a misnomer. The twitching... is the last movements that an infected... You're crazy! So, you're saying that they know what they're doing? On some basic level, yes. And they're almost screaming at themselves to stop. But they can't. Ahem. Hey, this is Aidan. Um, this is my 16th video log, I think. I've made one every day since... Made one almost every day since the first one. I'm slowly running out of... like everything. And, uh... I mean, I know at some point I'm gonna have to go out there. But, um... The news has stopped sending people out to shoot anything new. So, they keep playing the same clips over and over, and keep saying the same things. And it's weird how they try to stay calm and act calm like nothing's happening. But... you can tell that something is. I-I still watch it, though, because I-I don't know, maybe I'll see my family on it. I know it's stupid. What are the odds, right? I read this thing a long time ago about, um, sensory deprivation. They put people in these sensory deprivation chambers, and there's no sound, no-no sight, um, nothing. And then after a little while, you-you kinda... you start to hallucinate. Like, completely sane people would start to see things. Just to see something. Kind-of like an input for the brain. I think that I've started to... Like out of my periphery, I... I don't know, I think that there'll be like a... That's real. No. No. Oh! Oh... Oh... What is happening to me? It's like I, uh... No, I do know what's happening. It's not a mystery. I'm losing my mind. I... I keep, uh... I keep thinking about these stories, where... a guy crawls miles in the snow on-on two broken legs just to get to safety. And... I can't even open my front door. It's a hell of a thing to... you know, find out that you're a coward, to like... to like know that, you know? Well, I begin starving in three days. What the...? Did you hear...? What-what the...? All circuits are currently busy. Please, try again later. Aidan. Honey, are you there? It's Mom. Your dad and I are really worried about you. I hope you're at home. Your sister got out of town - before the roads got blocked. - Go to your sister's. - She's heading to our cabin. - Be safe. We couldn't get out of here fast enough. Please, try to get ahold of her. She isn't answering our calls. I don't know if the phones are down or what. Please, do everything you can to get in touch with her. - And, honey, don't worry. - No, Dad... We're here locked in with everyone at the office. - We're okay. - I wish we were all together. Listen to me, honey. Do not go outside, and keep the doors locked. There's somebody outside the door. Don't. Get out of here. Mary, stay under the desk. - What's happening? - I'll be right back. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Stay here. Please, no. That's my daughter! Please, no, don't kill... - Tom. - No, please! Tom... Keep away! Tom. I can't believe... Hello? Why... why... Mom... Dad... Mom... Please. Stop. Please. Stop. I'm okay! I'm okay! Sh... Come here! Please, help me! Come here. Here. Come here! Come here! Come... here. Come here. Come here! This is Aidan. It's... It's day 42. I'm sorry. Okay. Shit. This is my last video blog. Uh, my battery's about to die, and I don't have any way of charging it now. So... I met a girl today. Well, "met" might be a strong word because... I'm almost certain that she was real, though. And she might be alone, too. And-and need water or food or help somehow. And I could help her, I think. So, tomorrow I'm gonna try. I'm sure she was real. She has to be. And... Oh, yeah. Oh, there goes my battery. No, no, no, no! This way! Hi. Oh, my God, you look like a psychopath. Aidan. No, no, no, no, no. What...? No. Eva. Hi. Um... Yeah? Yeah, me too. Shoot. This sucks. Okay. You're the first... Yeah? Yeah? ...person... Ah, come on. Where did you put it? Come on, Aidan. Stupid. Right, she can see you. Stop talking to yourself. Um... I... Huh. Shit. Okay. And, uh... A shitload. Oh, my gosh, I can't believe this is working. She's joke... Oh, my God. Stupid. I know. Sorry. No, no, no, no, no. No. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Bye, Eva. Eva. Eva. That's not good. Okay. Um... Yes! Now, just... Please work. Oh, my God. Stop! No! Hey, no! No! Here! Yeah, yeah. Here! Here! Here! Here! Here! Yeah! - Kill me! Kill me! - Shit. Kill me! Oh, shit. Hey, hey, hey! No! No! Hey! No, no, no! Right here! Right here! Hey, hey, hey! Right here! Right here! Right here! Get inside! Whoa! No! Hey! Come on. Stop it! I don't know what to do. Okay? Tell me what I should do. If I stay here, I die. You know that. Okay, so, then what? You can't get to her through the hallways. No hallways. Get closer to her. But what the hell is closer? Every door is locked in the hallways. Maybe I could, uh... Oh, that's it. Oh, no! Oh, no. I hate this. Peanut b... Oh, yeah, this stuff never goes bad. Oh, yeah. Mm, okay. Of course, he's a rock climber. Come on. Yes, yes, yes. Something, something, anything. There's got to be something, come on. There's got to be something in here. Come on. Whoa. Sh... Badass. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! No! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Get off me! Help me. Help me. - You gotta be kidding me. - Help me. It just doesn't get any easier! Keep away. Keep away. Keep away. Save me. Save me. Save me. Keep away. No! Thank you. Oh... Oh! Oh... Okay. Hello. What? Oh, wait, how am I gonna get it to her? Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Okay, all right. Okay, okay. You're a fucking ninja. Okay. Okay. Okay. Whoa. You are a ninja. Yes~! Hello? Uh, Aidan? Hello? Eva. Hey. - Aidan? - It's... Oh, wait. - Are you there? - Yeah. Hey. Eva, hi. It's Aidan. Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me? Oh, my God. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I can hear you. Hey. Hi. Hello. Hi. I can't believe you did this. Sorry, um, it's been a while. Uh... How are you? I'm fantastic now. How are you? I'm great. It's really nice to hear your voice, Eva. It is so nice to hear your voice, too. Oh, wait, hey... Eva, before I forget... Is that pounding still happening on your wall? Because I was thinking, um... Uh, hey, Aidan? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm here. Sorry, I just haven't talked to anyone in a really, really, really long time. Yeah, me neither. Do you think maybe... we could just... I mean, I know we're gonna have to deal with all of it soon, but maybe... for a few minutes, we could just... talk... about something else? So, you surf, right? I sometimes see your surfboards and wetsuits out on the balcony. Um... Uh, yes, I surf. Yeah. You have a girlfriend, right? I feel like I've seen... Uh, that wasn't my girlfriend. Uh, what about you? Do you have a... boyfriend or girlfriend, or...? No. I mean, I was engaged a couple years ago. Um, but, no, not since then. Have you ever been in love? I was in love once. Yeah, in fifth grade, Jenny Caldwell. She was adorable, and she held my hand. And then I cried. And then threw up. It was the most romantic love story of this generation. I see that you like to draw. Do you... Are you... Do you like to draw? Yeah, I love to draw. Uh... You've been a subject of mine - once or twice. - You've drawn me before? It sounds a lot weirder than it actually is. I feel so violated. Just, I mean, I don't have very much to look at lately, so I'm sorry. I saw what you did last night. It was... so brave and courageous. And, um, I can't thank you enough. Thank you, Eva. Talk later? Yeah, talk later. Okay. Always wanted to be in one of these. Just like the movies. It really smells in here. Shit, shit. He's dead. He's dead. He's really dead. He's dead. Okay. Okay. Come on, please. Oh, my... Whoa. No way. Twinkies! Oh, be good to me. Mmm, mmm. Oh, my God, I got to tell Eva. Oh, my God. She'd freak out. Hey, Eva? Aidan? Eva, you're not going to believe what I just found. Where have you been? I-I went to look for food. What? Eva, look, I-I found something. What were you thinking? Are-are we... Are we fighting? Yes, Aidan. Because you just left. I don't really know why you're mad. You-you didn't tell me. We didn't talk about it. I've been trying you for the last 20 minutes getting no answer, thinking you were dead. You're scared of being alone? Well, so am I. I'm so sorry, Eva. We do things together now, okay? You don't withhold the fact that you're completely out of food. We talk about it, and we find a way to fix it together. Um... it's kinda nice to not be the only co-dependent one in this relationship, you know? Shut up. Where are you? - Uh, next door, I think. - Is it safe? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, there's nobody here. I came up through the crawl space above my bathroom, and there's nothing alive up there. - So... - And you found food? Eva, you will not believe. We could... we could wait this thing out. And... I mean, these things are gonna starve, you know? And then... and then I could go find my sister. We could find your family. And-and we can get out of here. And there's gotta be other people like us. You know, that-that survived. And we can find some place safe, you know? Eva? I don't know how much longer I can wait. Are they at your wall again? Dammit. Wait... Four, five times a day now. The news said they repeat patterns when they get desperate. - Okay... - I made a rope, like yours. - You what? - Out of bed sheets. Do you think if I climbed down on my side, I-I could get back up on yours? Yeah... yeah. Uh, yeah, maybe. - Or maybe the hallways? - No, no. No hallways, Eva. No hallways. The-the rope was a good idea, okay? - I'll come to you. - No, no. It's-it's too much for you to risk. I'm not gonna leave you there alone. Aidan, no, please. Are-are you sure it's safe for you to be talking in there? Uh, yeah, yeah. The fridge is pushed up against the door and everything. Wait. What? What? - Did you move the refrigerator? - No. Well, if no one's in there, how could the refrigerator be up against the door? Aidan? Aidan? I'm here. You have to get out of there. I can't, Eva, I... I have to go back for the food and the backpack. No, no, no. Listen to me, forget all that. It's not safe. It's not safe. You have to get out. No, no. Eva, I can't. We'll starve. I have to go back. I have to turn down my walkie, okay? So it doesn't make any noise. Eva, if anything happens to you, throw-throw a-a wine bottle or something into the courtyard, and I'll hear it break, and I'll come for you. Eva? Please, come back to me. Please, be safe. I will. What the hell? You're not screaming. You're not either, but you got blood there. Oh, I-I cut myself on something. That's a pretty cool spear you got there. I made it. Really? You can't just pick one of those up at the convenience store? I'm not sick, okay? If I were, I'd be begging for you to take my life. I've seen what it does. I apologize for threatening you with this. If I ever did have any manners, I guess they're pretty well gone now. Yeah. I... I did come try to take your food, though. It's not my food. I came through the wall a couple of weeks ago. We're both looters. Okay. Are-are you alone? Huh? Yeah. I'm... yeah. You? Uh, yeah. Well, who were you talking to earlier? What? I heard you talking... earlier. Oh, that was... me. I-I talk to myself sometimes now. I do it all the time. But I'm old. Old people do that. So, I guess whoever lived here was out of the apartment when it started. - You didn't know him? - No, did you? Well, sort of. I mean, he was my neighbor. But he wasn't out. He killed himself in the bathroom back there. - Did you open those? - What? The curtains. Yeah, to-to let the light in. He killed himself? Don't do that, okay? - Okay. - Yeah. Cut his wrists in the bathtub. It must've been early days, given how much food was here when I came through the wall. Where's the body? I wrapped it in a blanket, taped it up, and dragged it into the hall. Is that the only bag you brought? Yeah, yeah. Wait. I'll bring you another one. You looked like you were hungry. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. - Chew it. Eat it slowly. - Mm, right. Wow. Oh... Thank you. This is, uh, this is really good. Thank you. I-I cure it myself. Always have done. Oh, wow. Did you live with anybody before this? What? Eat slowly. Chew it. - Chew it. Mm-hmm. - Sorry. You know, I mean, roommate? Girlfriend? No. No, it was just me. Oh. You've been alone the whole time? I mean, I'm only saying that just because if there were someone, we should make sure that they get something to eat. Yeah... Have you killed anybody yet? Oh, I shouldn't ask you that. I'm sorry. - I really shouldn't. - No, no, really, it's-it's okay. I have. But there's, um... There's one that I didn't kill. Um... he's the one I think about still. Why would you kill someone if you don't absolutely have to? Yeah. Hey, did you watch the news before the power went out? Well, it said that... these people know what they're doing. I mean, can you imagine that? I'd want somebody to kill me, too. Maybe they'll find a cure. Shit, we've been looking for a cure to cancer for over a hundred years. And that was before the world went to shit, so... I should let you eat. I'm sorry. That... that wasn't helpful at all. You've been so kind. I... Have you had to? Had to what? Kill one. Me? No. No, never. That's good. Yeah. Hey, you sure that you're okay with all of this? Hey, there's got to be enough here for us for a month. And we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Yeah, and I do think that if we hold out as long as possible, they'll all eventually starve and die. You're probably right, actually, given the limited supply of what those cannibals eat. If I grab something that you want me to leave, let me know. Yeah. Do you think he had a wife? What? The guy who lived here. Jonathan. His name was Jonathan. Yeah, sorry. Um, a wife... no, I don't think so. There were no women's clothes here. Yeah, I was just thinking that it might be a reason to, um... give up. I mean, if your partner got sick with this, yeah, I guess for some people that might be. Maybe. No, that's mine. Have you lost anybody to this? - My parents. - Ah, I'm sorry. And my sister, I think. I don't know. But that... that's it, really. They're the only three people in the world that I gave a shit about and gave a shit about me. So... Well, your sister. I mean, she might be alive. It's actually worse not knowing. You know, wondering if I should be out there trying to find her. I mean, I think it's worse. I-I don't know whether I agree with you there. Yeah, I'm sorry. Well, think about it for a minute. Imagine you've been with someone for most of your life, and it's been a long life. So, whoever you each became, you became together. And together was really the only way you knew yourself. Imagine that you had problems, like everybody has problems. But whenever you looked at her, you knew exactly who was looking back. And you knew exactly what she felt for you and what you felt for her. No matter what else was going on around you, you knew. You knew. You knew that at the core, it was unchangeable. And then... she became sick. Or whatever that is that's going on out there. And she didn't look at you with love anymore. She looked at you with hate. Just the sight of you filled her with hatred. Imagine what that must be like. I think that'd be worse. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm talking about. - I... - Come on. Don't be silly. I'm just an old man having fun. I'm whiling away the time. Debating with a young man. Making up stuff just for argument's sake. Okay. I shouldn't be having fun. Not at this time. You're-you're a young man, and your future has been ruined by this, and... It's not fun. And I feel sad for you. I do. I feel very sorry. There's some booze at the top shelf up there. Go grab some for yourself. Yeah. Thanks. Oh, wow. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill-kill me! You've come to. Took your time about it. I hope I didn't hurt you. What's going on? Please, keep your voice down, for God's sake. Kill me. Kill me. Lucy, stop! I-I'm... I'm so sorry. I-I really am. This was supposed to have been finished already. But... you were conscious and she wouldn't... She wouldn't what? She wouldn't what? Kill me! Kill me! Lucy, stop! I-I don't know your name. Aidan. Aidan? I'm Edward. Please! You can't. It's better if you keep your voice quiet. It arouses her when she hears you. - What the... No! Oh, God! - Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! - Kill me! Kill me! - Lucy, please. Kill me. Oh, God. Kill me! I've never hurt anyone in my life. Never. This isn't who I am. But what-what-what else can I do? - I love her. - Kill me! You take care of the person you love. You can't take care of everybody, not in times like this. But you take care of your family. How can that be wrong? If you kill me, she won't eat. - I know that. - Kill me. So, what we're gonna do is you're gonna take these pain pills. As-as many as you want. And then when they take effect, I'm gonna make a little cut in your femoral artery and you'll bleed, and then when you've bled enough so that you're too weak to resist... Then I'll bind your feet and move you closer to her. You won't feel anything by then. Nothing. Kill me! How long has she been like this? Since the beginning. - Kill me. - You've done this before! - Just like with your neighbor! - No, he was already dead. She wouldn't touch him. No, you're-you're the first human person. My two dogs. She had my two dogs. This is crazy! My beautiful, loving, loyal dogs. She-she didn't understand it was them. Oh, God, she would be so disappointed in me. The only part of her that's your wife is telling you what she wants. She doesn't know what she wants! She's begging you to die! Oh, she's sick. - And there-there may be a cure. - And then what? She-she's never gonna forgive herself for eating people! Anyone who survives this will have to be forgiven unforgivable things. But you can't... You can't, man. I have to. I don't have a choice. No, please! No, you please! - I don't... - Kill me. - She's in pain. - She's in pain? I'm in pain. Jesus, God! She was a teacher. Did you know that? I don't think I told you that. Aidan! Jesus Christ! - No! No, no, no, no, no! - Somebody's out there. - No, no! - You're with someone! Kill me! Oh, no! Aidan, help me! - Eva? - Aidan, listen to me. They're inside. They're in my house. I'm coming to get you. Come on! They're in my room. Okay, I'm coming to get you. How? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get away! Get away. Get away! Get away! Get aw... Aidan?! Quick, Aidan. Quick, Aidan! I'm coming! Watch out! Get off! Get off! Aidan, hurry, get him off! - Get him off me! - Get him off, Aidan! Eva? You just have to climb down to me. You can do it! Hey, just look at me! Look at me! Aidan, I... I can't... Eva, you-you have to! You have to, okay? Just climb down! You can do it! Yeah. Just like that. I got you. I got you. Just like that, perfect. - Hi. - Hi. We should probably... go. - Ready? - Yeah. Okay. Eva! I got you! Go, go. - Kill me. - Oh! My God! Aidan. Aidan. I got it. I got it. I got it. - Kill... me. - Come on! Kill me. Forget it. We'll leave him. Come on. Come on. Kill me. Okay, all right, we're here. We're gonna get out, make a right, go around the corner, and then straight into 4327. - Four-three-two-seven. - Okay? - Okay. Yeah. - Ready? Eva! Aidan! Aidan, watch out, watch out, watch out! No! Come on! Come on! - Are you okay?! - I'm okay. - Did he get you? No? - No. No. - Okay. Okay. All right. - I'm good. Oh, my God! It's right here! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on! Aidan! Aidan. Come on! No! Aidan. Damn it! I'm sick of this! Oh, wait. No, hey! Wait, don't touch me! No. Stop. Stay back. Here. Eva, take this. - No. No... - Hold me off. You... you have to hold me off, please. No. Please, don't make me do this. - No, I can't. - Eva, I don't know how much time we have. - Aidan, please. - If it's bad... Eva, you have to hold it up! Hold it up! Please, don't make me do this! Please, I'm begging you, Aidan. Don't. Stop! No! Aidan! Please. Stop! Aidan, please stop. Please, don't do this! Please, don't do this. Please. Aidan. Aidan, no. Please, please. Please, get down. Aidan, I can't do this without you. Please. Don't do this. Please. Please. Eva, you're gonna be okay. No, I'm not. I'm not. Go to the attic in my bathroom and take it to my neighbor's apartment. They have food, it'll last you the rest of the month. You'll wait it out. I'm not going to make it if you're not here. Please, don't go. Please. Eva, you saved my life. And I love you. You're gonna be okay. You can't... No, don't... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Cool. - I hate you. - I'm-I'm sorry. Come here! Eva, we can beat this. We're stronger together. Okay.
