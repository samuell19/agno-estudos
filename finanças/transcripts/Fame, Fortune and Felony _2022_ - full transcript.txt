The biggest night in Hollywood is Oscar night. Those are real movie stars. A star is somebody who really has studied their craft, being super-talented for acting, singing. These are artists and stars. Celebrities are like our royalty. I think certain people do have that special something that's unique and magical. I think there's a difference between star and celebrity. Celebrities, you're famous for being famous, you're popular, but there's no real talent. In the 2000s, reality TV and social media has made celebrities very accessible to everybody. You were gaining instant access into these people's lives that you never had before. Anyone can be a celebrity, but it takes something special to be a star. Every celebrity with even a hint of fame is invited out to one party or another on Oscar night. We just thought the young reality starlet type would be more prone to maybe leaving something unlocked than a star. Oscar night, being around the corner, seemed to be one of the best nights to... HE LAUGHS ..commit a burglary! So in the beginning of 2009, to make sure that, you know, that Rachel and I weren't, you know, exposed in our burglary with Paris Hilton, we would, you know, monitor sites like TMZ constantly, and after about a week or two of not seeing anything on those sites, we knew we were in the clear. So, um... we for sure were like, "We can do this again, no problem." MUSIC: Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield # The rest is still unwritten... # The Hills was a reality show and it was just, like, being young and hot and single in LA. PHOTOGRAPHER: Show me that dress! Rachel really, really liked Audrina Patridge's style. So she asked me, you know, to do my thing. You want to break into a Hollywood mansion? Step one, locate the address. Step two, Google Maps. It was in the hills in Hollywood. Next - when will that house be vacant? The TMZ website did that work for us. She's going to be out at some sort of party on Oscar night. Make a note of the camera positions, but don't act suspicious. We weren't concerned with anybody being able to identify us. We weren't in the system, our mugshots aren't there, our fingerprints aren't there, we're like ghosts. We had our gloves and our, you know, a couple of tools. Rachel and I approach Audrina's house. DOORBELL RINGS We ring her doorbell. No one was home. Let's do it. I have not been back into this house in six years, and there's just an overwhelming, overwhelming emotions going through me right now. Before I was famous, my home was like my private sanctuary. After I was famous, I was so used to filming in my house all the time, it felt like a set. There was just that uncomfortable vibe. Why wouldn't you just talk to me about it? Like, obviously... My life was an open book. I actually had just got back from Australia, and I went on a huge shopping spree where I spent so much money at Maxfields with this stylist and then I went to an Oscar event. I came home after, and I went to go in my suitcase and my suitcase was gone. And I looked in my jewellery box and everything was gone. Someone's been in my house. What if someone's in the house and they're like, they're in the other room? I was thinking, "They're going to kill me." I locked myself in my closet. I was the most terrified I've ever been in my entire life. So there's a moment in every story when we first meet the nemesis. And it's important to give them a good establishing character moment. So here's a retired LAPD officer sitting down on a chair in slow motion. My name is Greg Kading. I'm a retired Los Angeles police detective. Over the course of my career, I investigated just about every imaginable crime from petty theft up to serial murders. And I worked burglary for a period of time. It's somewhat unusual for a celebrity home to be targeted. You know, it used to be, the king lived in the castle. You don't get to see him, but you know he's there. Now you get to live with celebrities, you know, you're in their homes and they're telling you the most intimate details of their lives. But in the domain of their home, that is their sanctuary. These are victims of crime. I'm going to find out who these two people are, and they're going down. Miss Patridge provided surveillance video. It's just sickening to watch. Rachel and I went around to the side gate. It was open. We walked up the hill, and we were in her backyard. We noticed sliding glass doors. It just opens, like "Oh, my God, you're fucking kidding." Like, really? Another unlocked door. You know, you're excited. You know, what are we going to find? Companies and brands would just send you boxes of stuff in the hopes that you'd wear it on the show. Clothes, boxes of shoes, purses. But also they took sentimental things that were passed down from grandmothers and great grandmothers. It was like they went shopping in my closet. We felt slick, proud of ourselves that we just committed another burglary successfully and got away with it, essentially. And we're not stealing from the poor. It just changed everything from that point forward. It definitely made me more guarded and not trusting of anyone or anything. They needed to be punished. If you have CCTV of young people committing a crime and you're trying to identify them, it's always a good idea that we appeal to an audience that was in kind of that age range, so then it raises the question, how do you do that? To me, 2006 through 2009 was by far definitely the golden era of gossip. All of America was obsessed with materialism, celebrity. It was a great way to escape. Things started shifting from people buying the magazines at the checkout stands at the grocery stores to just going online. People didn't want to read about it a week later in a magazine. I can upload an image or a story within minutes of it happening. You were gaining instant access into these people's lives in a way that you never had. So you have this huge pressure on being in the right place and wearing the right clothes and having the right lifestyle. It was the beginning of influencing, essentially. Um, I call myself the original influencer. Websites like mine inspired the folks behind TMZ to launch that website. TMZ, an online newsroom with the very latest celebrity news. Does being a celebrity have anything to do with talent any more? Not necessarily. It has to do with exploiting the moment. TMZ appealed to a younger generation, so it would make sense to give TMZ the first look at the CCTV in order to get these individuals identified. Shortly after the Audrina burglary, I was constantly monitoring TMZ. Fuck. My heart sank into my stomach. I got the chills. I was pacing all around my room, I couldn't sit still. It seems that everything related to this woman is caught on tape. Even when her house gets robbed, we've got video. It was everywhere, their faces were everywhere. I thought we were fucked. I thought we were going to get caught. Hey, guys, I hope you enjoyed that montage of LA. So you would think I'd now react to Nick being all over the news, but in reality, I didn't actually see it. I was far too busy manifesting my Hollywood career with my mom. My chief aim in life is to strive to express greater and greater portions of my potential as a professional who is enjoying a successful career working in the film industry. The dominating thoughts in my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward physical action and gradually transform themselves into physical reality. The affirmation was to have a successful career in the entertainment industry. We had been doing the affirmation at this point for a while, and then all of a sudden... PHONE RINGS I got a phone from this producer Dan Levy and he's like, "Can I talk to Andrea?" and I was like, "Yeah, this is me." Dan was just, like, an actor for a film that Tess and I were doing called Frat Party. We told Dan that we're all about manifesting and we're going to, like, make it big in Hollywood and yada yada. And he said, "Would you be interested in shooting a pilot "for a reality show?" And I was like "Oh, no, no, no, no, that's not what I'm interested in. "I'm interested in doing real acting." My mom was pretty excited about it. I have no recollection of her being like, "Now, girls, I don't think so." He said, "Yeah, but wouldn't it be great "if you could teach the law of attraction on national television?" And I was like, "Well, yeah, that sounds really good to me", you know? So we started to film for the pilot in May. Gabbie, it is time for school. Hi, I'm Andrea. Put that away. This is not OK with me at all. I am the mother of three wild and crazy kids. Gimme a kiss. ELECTRIC ZAP, BOTH YELP They had this vision which was a hippy version of the Kardashians, right? I am getting back exactly what I dished out, except in threes. Let's do the frequency machine on you. I had them all evaluated and they were told they had ADHD, and so every morning I give the girls Adderall. Girls, it's time for your Adderall! Our jaws just dropped, like, "Oh, my God, that is awesome." I mean, it was exciting and a great fun idea, but I think you'd probably have a greater chance of winning the lottery than you do of getting your own reality show on E! After the Audrina burglary, all the news channels had ran it and it was over. Cos news, you know, there's always something better the next day. I was like, "OK, what's next?" And so eventually, we chose our next victim. MUSIC: California by Phantom Planet # California, here we come... # Rachel was an avid watcher of the OC. It was about a bunch of rich high school kids living the dream lifestyle. Come on, let me buy you lunch. My dad gave me his credit card in case of emergencies, and, well, this is an emergency. OK. Rachel Bilson was known for being a bit of a fashion It girl, the most serious actress thus far. We were slowly moving up. All right, you know the drill. When will that house be vacant? She was going to New York for a fashion event. Remember to stick to your normal routine. You don't want to arouse suspicion. The night she was out of town, we were actually out at a party that night. Remember to keep a clear head. I was maybe a little more drunk than normal, so I did a bit of coke, sobered myself up, if you could call it that. I was driving along at, like, 80 to 90, like, speeding. SIREN WAILS A cop saw us, I get lit up behind me. We were like, "Fuck." If you run into a cop, lean on the coke. It'll make you appear sober. The cop comes up, you know, "What are you doing tonight?" and I was like "Oh, you know, I'm so sorry I was going a little fast." And he's like, you know, "Don't let it happen again" and just, you know, "Have a good night." I was like, "Great." We get to Rachel Bilson's house. Rachel Bilson burglary marked. So we found a window which was unlocked. We were inside. Welcome to Casa Fantastica, the perfect sanctuary away from the outside world. In LA, your house is your business card. Your style of your home tells a lot about you. It was very cute. It was like a Spanish style of Los Feliz. Is it Los "Fel-eeze" or Los Feliz? In the heart of Los Feliz, a dramatic living room features a captivating stained-glass window and Saltillo tile floor. Two-storey, wrought-iron staircase. We both walked up stairs, located the bedroom. That's when Rachel's eyes just... She had nothing that was not designer. Oh, hey, welcome back, what can I help you with today? Designer bags are the biggest status symbol. Certain designer bags are worth more than actual gold. So much Chanel, I mean, and Chanel purses are, like, so expensive. It's a Chanel bag, you have made it. We were getting more comfortable. Rachel had to use the restroom, so she uses the restroom. It was quick. It was like a sneaker poop, you know. Because that's evidence. No, yeah, of course she flushed! The next day... PHONE BUZZES ..I was on BBM with Alexis. We were hanging out more and more. You know, I was drawn to her. She definitely was looking to be in the Hollywood scene in some fashion. That's kind of what I was looking for at that time in my life, I wanted to feel like somebody. In total, we probably partied, like, five or six times, and I had a fun time. I mean, he was just like a valley kid, right? We got drunk, we got fucked up, we drove home. Us with, you know, getting closer and being pretty close at that point... PHONE VIBRATES ..I arranged to meet up with them. I went over there with the stuff. I said, "OK, girls, you know the drill, "look into the trunk and see what you like." I never knew, I guess, how to make genuine friendships and connections without showing off. I was trying to buy a friendship, in a sense. When I woke up, I came out of my room. Tess was there with Gabbie and they had suitcases full of clothes. And I was like, "Whoa, where did you get all these clothes?" Um, hello? She knew exactly where the clothes were coming from. Since Paris Hilton's house, they had received the leftovers of whatever no one else wanted, essentially. No. It wasn't like, "Here's Nick, the robber of Paris Hilton "who's got, you know, millions of dollars of jewels." Like, it wasn't like that. Then Andrea popped in and she's like... "Girls, what is going on?" My mom asked, "How did you get all of this stuff?" Tess said, "Oh, from our friend Nick, he's a stylist "and he's just loaning us this stuff for right now." Alexis, you're insane. At that time, we were hanging out with lots of people in the industry, so I didn't think twice. The girls got to use these clothes to do photo shoots to enhance their portfolio, so I was OK with that. Andrea legitimately thought I was a stylist. Tess and Alexis obviously knew I wasn't. I offered Andrea a bag and I could tell she got excited because I think, you know, she's a little vapid. That was just not my style. But I was trying to be gracious and kind and I was like, "Well, thank you, that's very nice of you." I was excited about new clothes and cute stuff to wear out. I felt accepted. They were popular and they took me under their wing and it was a confidence booster. But I would shortly thereafter find out that Nick wasn't a stylist, that Nick had stolen the clothes and that he was involved with all of these burglaries. The personal impact on victims of burglaries is sometimes overlooked. The property taken sometimes is irreplaceable. In the case of Bilson, we know that her mother's engagement ring had been stolen. I've heard it said, "They're wealthy celebrities, "they can afford to lose these things." Or, "Hey, they didn't lock their doors, "you know, it's their fault." We have to stop looking at the victims as being responsible. The perpetrators, they had no regard for these people as human beings. You can just kind of hear them giggling and laughing. And they're also emboldened to continue to commit these crimes even though they know that their images have been captured and publicised. They probably have no idea as to the seriousness of their crime, and they don't recognise the potential danger to themselves. I will concentrate my thoughts for 30 minutes a day on the task of thinking of the person I intend to become. My daily life has a never-ending vacuum for new opportunities to emerge in the entertainment industry. My name is Gennifer Gardiner. I'm an executive producer, show runner. My name is Amber Mazzola and and I, er, ruin people's lives! Well, Kardashians was a huge success, so I think everybody wanted their three sister shows and these girls were very open and they were trying to break into Hollywood. So that was the premise originally, right? These girls are on their way to being famous and I've got to be watching them every step of the way. And so it is. ALL: And so it is. Woo! We heard back from E! Entertainment and they were interested in picking up the show. I mean, we went from being, "Well, maybe this will happen, maybe not" to all of a sudden like, "This is really happening." So, we showed up at the production company for our show. And Tess showed up with Nick Prugo. When you're developing a show, there's A characters, B characters and C characters, so Nick was one of the options. At that age, the idea of having or being a part of some reality show is awesome. So I was excited. I mean, it was exciting. My first impression was, they were very sweet. I thought they were outgoing, which is always good for a television show. Our concern was, "What story are we going to tell here "and what are we following?" So Alexis and her family could sell a good story, right? She's like, "He's my gay best friend, and that's how they were trying to sell me, as if that's gonna be a quality for a character on the show. But I was just coming into my sexuality and kind of getting comfortable with it. I certainly wasn't ready to be this flamboyant personality that I think they wanted me to be. It was honestly so bad that they were like, "He can't be here, we can't do this." I was disappointed in myself for not being able to deliver a character. So it just further, I guess, confused me even more. I just, I was super-uncomfortable. I didn't know who to be. I think people definitely have star qualities. I think out of the bunch, Alexis probably had that. I agree. I think Alexis was the one that I came away from the meeting as the star. They wanted to be famous, and I don't think they cared honestly how they were going to get famous, but they wanted to be a Kardashian. It wasn't about fame, it was simply about doing what I know I loved doing, and that was being on camera. That appeal for fame, for me, was validation. To feel like somebody cared, for once. We were all having fun living a life that was playful and we were a very connected family, that's what the filming showed. Now, the truth of the matter was, there was a lot of fractured energy between all of us. Life at home with my mum was chaotic. She was super-controlling, super-shaming and her mental health really impacted the overall health of our home. I mean, you don't call your daughter a cunt, you just don't. I was a narcissistically driven woman during those years and so my way of being in a relationship with other people, including my daughters, was to sort of make them dependent on me. I mean, I was smoking weed with the girls back then, totally. Like, it was all about them not abandoning me. Tess and Gabbie had been out partying and I got a call from them saying, "Where are you right now? We're going to come pick you up." Tess and I were the ones who brought Oxy to my sister, actually, for the first time. Her and I tried it at some kid's house in the valley that she knew. Tess and Gabbie pulled out this foil with this pill on it, and I didn't even think twice. I was like, "This is it?" The feeling of doing Oxy for the first time was like the warmth in the hug of a loving parent. It was this feeling that it's all going to be OK. I didn't know that Oxys were so addictive, and I hated it. I don't like the feeling of being numb to the world. Oxycontin is a very strong opiate. I would equate it to heroin in pill form. I was not capable of stopping. They were doing some drugs that I wasn't ever familiar with, my drugs of choice were hallucinogenics and cocaine. And it was scary to me. I was like, "Wait a minute, "you guys are talking about doing a reality show, "everybody better pull their shit together and, like, behave." Our addiction got crazy, so she asked Tess to leave and I followed suit. My parents went out of town and I had the house to myself and I invited her to, you know, stay with me. Hi, Nicky, I'm recording you. Hot bitch. The teenage boy. After a lucky late night, that's where the craziness went down. This is when Alexis first expressed interest in becoming a part of it, because according to her words, you know, "I want first choice." "I don't want Rachel's hand-me-downs", essentially. I don't recall having any conversation with Nick like that. Um, I know what happened, you know? So anyway, this was me and Rachel's thing. I didn't really want to expand the enterprise. I think I was smart enough to realise, you know, the more people that know, loose lips sink ships. So it was onto the next. PAPARAZZO: Orlando! Orlando! I remember this one pretty well. Orlando Bloom was a megastar. huge blockbuster movies, the highest profile person that we had targeted thus far. He was working on some movie at the time. Open house. I was supposed to initially just go with Rachel. Alexis begged me to go. I wasn't saying, "Hey, Nick, next time you rob a house, involve me." But I was open to the idea of robbing a house to get money for drugs. Rachel wanted to bring her friend Diana. I felt, like, a little traded in, like she traded me in for a different model. But you know, if you're going to bring Diana, then I'll bring someone else in. I'll bring Alexis, even though I'd been avoiding it, you know. So, um, begrudgingly, I brought her. Like, I remember bits and pieces of what happened, but not all the way through because I was under the influence of opiates and benzos. HE LAUGHS Alexis was not out of it. Alexis was more than sober and more than aware. We meet Rachel and Diana outside of Orlando Bloom's house. Did you know you were going over to Orlando Bloom's house? That night, no. I wasn't aware of whose house it was that night. Alexis was very much aware that she was outside Orlando Bloom's house. No. Oh, well. I remember there was a camera in the tree by the house. We had already been on camera with Audrina Patridge, so we walked backwards, obscuring our identities, and we approached the gate. At that point, I had to pee. There was no pee. I did pee. She jumped through that fence, you know, like Wonder Woman. There was a sliding door that opened. We all split up and started shopping. Alexis started bagging up shit for herself. Rachel and Nick just had this confidence, but I was like "Oh, fuck, this is real, I'm in someone's house." She was happy to do it. "I'm gonna barf." There was definitely, you know, a bit of the wow factor. I think I even did throw up. It's such a crock, the version of events I hear from her. I didn't come here to, like, save face. I came here to be honest and to move on. Whatever. I went to his closet, just took a ton of his clothes. Um... "Oh, fuck, if I get caught, I'm screwed." All of a sudden I hear, "Oh, my God!" Big score. Like, ten Rolex watches and, like, five grand in cash in an envelope. The adrenaline had really kicked in. It just seemed all very stepped up, less of a fun little mission to more of a serious criminal job. We didn't tell Alexis about the Rolexes and the cash because we didn't wanna share them with her, because we didn't want her there anyway. I grabbed a Louis Vuitton computer bag and I grabbed a black sequin dress. We started making our exit out of the house. In and out. On this kind of high. Drove home. PHONE RINGS One night I'm at home and I get this call, and it was Alexis and she said, "Mom, I need to come home, "Nick is into some stuff with some other kids "that is really scary to me." I said, "OK, come home." INTERVIEWER: She did not go into any detail at all but it felt dark, it felt very dark. Thank you, Orlando. Thank you very much. Sorry about your break-in. REPORTER: A group of teenagers broke into the home of Orlando Bloom, stealing designer clothes, cash and his vintage watch collection. The Orlando Bloom case came into the same division where Audrina Patridge's case was being handled, and the same type of items are being stolen. Now investigators had potential serial burglars. We call that an ongoing criminal enterprise, and it becomes more recognised and ultimately more serious. It just takes this to a different level. We felt like criminals in the most chic way. We felt like we were these, like, maybe sexy bandits committing these intelligent cat burglaries. Like in a movie. We wanted to be our own celebrity, just using other people's shit. Orlando Bloom, he had great style, which worked out great for me because he was like my size. I wore these clothes because I wanted to be looked at and seen and I want to have that attention. By 2009, social media was still in its infancy, and more so than reality television. Social media really birthed this entire class who were taking control over their own narrative. Social media has changed everything. It's democratised fame. MySpace was really ground-breaking. I mean, you were really able to personalise a page that you tried to have represent who you were. MySpace is like the prototype for Facebook. For young kids who don't feel comfortable in your skin yet and you want to be, like, in the know, it's highly addictive. We're constantly being bombarded with images of our friends and families and celebrities living these seemingly perfect lives, and it's just human nature to compare ourselves to others. I wanted people to want what I had, kind of like how I wanted to have what the celebrities had. When you look at people's lives on social media, you're looking at a fabrication. You're presenting your best image to show the world how great you're doing. You would post albums just full of, you know, 100 photos, of just like, "This was my night out." I'd never had that feeling of feeling good in my own skin. It felt great, it was a nice feeling. I finally felt like this is who I wanted to be. We heard back from E! Entertainment and they were interested in picking up the show. This felt like, "Wow, we're going to do this, this is it." We were in such bad financial straits and this was the one thing that promised to be a saving grace. E! gave us an offer we couldn't refuse. A $50,000 signing bonus, and around $100,000 for the season, each of us. We were gonna do the first episode and then we would go from there. They started kind of distancing themselves. I think a part of them thought they were, you know, on a different level now and they didn't really need me any more now that they had this show. You know, it bothered me. They had their own income that was about to start flowing in and they were flying high, you know, literally. I went from feeling like a nobody to a somebody really quick. We were gaining access to a scene that we never had before. Tess worked a glamorous Playboy shoot and she met Kid Rock. Which was pretty fucking cool, to be honest. Tess and I were invited over to his house and there were the coolest group of people there. TI was there, Cindy Crawford and some of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were there. It was like a dream. And I spent the night talking to this man who was one of the biggest actors in Hollywood, ever. We were in the bathroom, some of us were, and this actor, he started to do this monologue in front of us that was so profound. I was like, "Wow." There are certain people in the world that just have that special something, and he had it. At that point, they were disappearing for a couple of days at a time, taking private jets with much older men. I didn't care because I had done the same things and it was fun and it was exciting for them and... whatever. Alexis didn't want to rob any more and I just, I mean, at least for me, I... I almost didn't know how to stop. By not committing crimes any more and, you know, essentially losing that lifestyle I would not be able to afford this illusion that I'd created. And that's scary, you know. So, you know, I kind of just went back more with Rachel. Lindsay Lohan is facing new legal troubles. Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan. So, if 2008 to 2010 had a face in LA, it would be Lindsay Lohan, a movie star. One of the most popular celebrities. Front page, every day. For those who care, actress Lindsay Lohan is in trouble again. Crashing her Mercedes. DUI... And cocaine in her possession... Rehab. She was badass and what Rachel and I were doing was badass, so on some level I kind of wanted to emulate that. I eventually found her address. We could have this one last hurrah. So, Lindsay Lohan was out 24/7. We for sure thought she was out. It was Rachel, Diana and myself. We got through the gates. We knew there were cameras. I had kind of like a scarf, like, half-assed laid over my head with a hat. However, I didn't, I didn't feel comfortable. There was no exit behind the house to the back yard. It dropped off a cliff. Lindsay could be home at any minute. I was more uneasy than usual. But Rachel and my friendship had solely become based on, you know, committing burglaries, so essentially by stopping, I'd be ending the relationship with Rachel. We boosted Diana into a window. Diana went in and unlocked the door. I'd never seen a house with so much stuff. Diana and Rachel, their heads exploded. You know, they didn't know where to begin, what to take, what to do. It was like hoarder's luxury. There was the awe, you know, factor of it all. I said, "Let's hit it," we left. My car was stuffed. Officer, do you have a suspect already? As a result of the Lindsay Lohan burglary, security camera footage was able to provide really good facial features of the perpetrators. So now the investigators recognise the Lohan case and the Patridge case, it's the same people. So, once again approached TMZ. I was doing my usual checks, and that's when... More articles started coming out comparing the two videos. Holy shit. Alexis said, "It's Nick Prugo, Mom. "Look at the news, he's wearing the hat that he always wears." We were all kind of like, "This is bad. This is really fucking bad." I instantly went into paranoia mode, so what I did just to protect myself was move all of the stolen property from every burglary I had to a storage facility at my grandmother's. My... heart has always wanted to tell the truth. I've always carried around guilt for what I did. So, Tess and I made a call to the Hollywood police department and we named Nick. If they had told me that they were going to do that, I would have said that it was stupid and they shouldn't do that. They were basically telling on themselves. The investigators simply logged onto Facebook, they went to Nick Prugo's Facebook page, looked at his profile picture and said, "Well, what do you know? It looks like that guy."
