(gears clunking) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (coughing) (choking) (suspenseful music) - Mauna Loa? - Yes? - Charles Pine, with the Max Corporation. - Are you president of this company? - Only temporarily, until Mr. Max has recovered from his illness. - What can I do for you, Mr. Pine? - I'm interested in your services. - Sailing, diving, or sports fishing? - You see, I have known Monsieur Jean Paul Masson for several years, both professionally and socially. He sends his warmest regards. (chuckles) And to tell you it's most unfortunate the way Mr. Rhiner lost his head over their little dispute. - The sun will be down in an hour, and we have a lot of work to do here. Meet me at the house this evening. - Can we talk now? - Be my guest. Well? I'm listening. - In precisely five days, the U.S. Senate Investigative Committee is scheduled to convene over allegedly illegal defense contracts involving the Max Corporation. Their entire case is centered around three of our executives. I want you to see to it that they have no case. - You know my fee? - Monsieur Masson made that quite clear. I'll give you $100,000 now. We'll give you the balance when you land in Los Angeles. - You said, "We?" - There are two of us. Let us just say, that neither one of us can afford a governmental investigation. - Three targets, five days. That leaves me little time to prepare. - Are you saying you can't do it? - No. - Then you won't do it? - I'll see you in Los Angeles, day after tomorrow. Hansen leaves tonight. He'll start the groundwork. - Agreed. - Not quite. The risk has made the cost go up. - How much? - One million. (tense music) - That's absurd. I can't possibly cover that. Mauna Loa? I need time. - Time you don't have, Mr. Pine. ("The Golden Goose" by Sherry Fisher and Marry Davis) - [Announcer] On the national scene, the Senate Intelligence Committee probe has re-opened investigations into defense contracts made with the Max Corporation. The committee spokesman, Senator Bill Dempsey, claims to have three Max executives who will testify against the industrial empire. Possibly, this will flush out Harold Max himself whose whereabout have been a mystery for the past five years. (plane roaring) (upbeat music) - [Travassi] Nice to meet you, babe. - Be back in a second, babe. Take care. Follow that car! Well, do it, man. (upbeat music) There he is, get him. Sandy car, 74. - [Woman On Radio] Go ahead, 74. - Need a make on car license plate 825 petty fox x-ray. - [Woman On Radio] 825 petty fox x-ray. Got him, 74. (upbeat music) - We've picked up company. - Pull into that hotel up ahead. (upbeat music) (tires screeching) (upbeat music) (mellow music) (waves lapping) - Boy, you're really looking calm out there. - The waves are weak. I knew waters cold and filthy. - Hey, blame the oil companies, not me. Now, how about something to eat? - [Mauna] Perhaps some fruits. Gallo Salame, if you have it. - We have it. - And some nuts. - Alright. One Mauna Loa special coming right up. - What's with you and that brown pineapple? - Well, he only wants something to eat, if it's alright with you. - Please don't get too friendly. - Come on! (waves crashing) Here we are, one Mauna Loa special. - [Hazard] Hi, Sid. - Hazard, I thought you were on vacation. - I am, is Captain Han in? - We check, just a second. Captain Han, Detectives Hazard and Travassi are here to see you. Yes, sir. He'll be with you in a moment. - Hi sweets. Lighten up, Sid. - What was that all about? - Ever since Captain Karate took over this division, every broad in here has become a lethal weapon. (buzzing) - Yes, sir? You can go in now. - [Han] Sit down, please. - A little matter has come up, an assassin named Mauna Loa. - What about Mauna Loa? - He's in town. - You saw him? - Yes, sir, we tailed him from the airport. But we lost him. - You lost him? - Yes, sir. But we know his contact, don't we, Haz? - Uh, yeah, right. - Who is this contact? - Well, sir, he was driving the car. - [Hazard] Well, Benny, the Wolf. Nearly pinned a murder charge on him two years ago. - Check him out. (mellow music) (beeping) - He wants to see you. He wants to see you now. (waves crashing) - [Glenda] Not bad. - Where is the contact? - The parking lot. Pacific Bay Club. (tense music) (mellow music) ("The Golden Goose" by Sherry Fisher and Marry Davis) (suspenseful music) (clattering) (suspenseful music) (tense music) - You're still working. May I give you some fresh tea? - No, thank you. I'll be through in a minute. - Okay. (clock ticking) (soft mellow music) (bell pealing) (rhythmic drum beating) (festive trumpet music) - What do you see out there? - [Travassi] A lot of people. - That's right, a lot of people. Murder creeps, the pushers, and the pickpockets should be having a field day out there. - Maybe (mumbles) they are. - [Hazard] I'll give you (mumbles) Mauna Loa. - [Low Rider] Well, Mr. Han. Who do we owe this pleasure to? You know what, I thought somebody might have shot your face off by now. - Now, that's no way to great old friends. - Geneva, call the cops. - There's no need to pull that. - Hey, get off it, Han, it's not a lie. You (mumbles) and you're on my private property. Shit! Hey, I'm on probation. I'm a legitimate businessman. There's no need for you to come here and hassle me. Okay, what do you want? - I heard Mauna Loa is in town. - Mauna Loa? So? - So, you are his nephew. - So, what do you want with me? - Nothing. I wanna know why he's here. - We haven't seen Mauna Loa in over five years, ever since he... - Go ahead and finish. Ever since he turned killer? - Han, you shouldn't even be here. You ought to be talking to Shaker. - Shaker? - He's been here about three months. He's got a karate studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. - Now, call Senator Dempsey for me, please, and tell him I have all the papers for the hearing. No, hold the rest of the messages. I won't be eating out tonight. I'll be home and I'll finish up here. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. (mellow music) (birds chirping) (tense music) - That's gotta be Bad News' car. Luck just changed. Now, maybe we can find out what the hell is going on. - I hope so. - What the-- (mumbling) (car revs) (tires screech) (upbeat music) (siren blaring) - Yeah, you the fuss or something, ei? If you want, I know my legal rights, ei. Ei, you ain't got no cause to hassle me. You did. I mean, either bust me, write me up, or flick off, turquoise fluke. - You must be Freddie. - Yeah, how'd you know? - I'm a friend of your brother's. - Hey, you know my karnal? - Huh? - My brother. - Oh, sure. - Alright. Oh, shit. Hey, don't tell him I got his car, ei. You know, he'll-- - Hey, have faith. - Alright. - Where is Bad News anyway? - Hey, he took off to Frisco, man. You know, he'd be gone for a couple of days, be back by Tuesday. - That's kind of a sudden trip, wasn't it? - Sure was. He came in with a wadful of money, tossed me a hundred and split, ei. - Bet that was the easiest thousand you ever made. - For sure. Hey, how'd you know it was a thousand? - [Hazard] I'd be watching. (suspenseful music) - We're having a private training session. You'll have to come back tomorrow. - I'm looking for Shaker. - He's busy. Hey, Shaker! - Hello, Shaker. Is there somewhere we can talk? - Sure, right here. Stay here. - I wanna know. Have you seen or heard from Mauna Loa? - Why? - He's in town. - What's the matter? You're afraid he came to claim his old lady back? Or did you want him to teach you some karate? You realize, of course, that Mauna Loa doesn't teach anymore. But A.J. and I'd be glad to teach you a lesson. Right, A.J.? - Sure. There's an extra uniform and white belt in the dressing room. - Have you heard from him? - Lessons are 30 bucks a month. We can start your first one right now. - Really good men in the martial arts, they were saying, "When the mouth is too big, "their knowledge is small." - We've got a saying in this school, too. It doesn't take much know-how to kick a chicken's butt, turkey. - Where do you know him from? - He's my brother-in-law. - [TV Anchor] On the business scene, Wall Street ended its week on the down low side as the Dow Jones Industrials fell by more than 70 points to 96. And now this Channel 7 news update. The Max Corporation has been the subject of much controversy the past couple of years, mostly because of the unorthodox and mysterious manipulations of its phantom chairman, Harold Max, a man of mystery himself. - I'll be back in a minute. - [TV Anchor] Channel 7 newsman Bob Brady is at the scene with Charles Pine, Max Corporation executive and spokesman for the giant industrial conglomerate, and he files this report. - Here today to interview Charles Pine regarding the allegations concerning the Max Corporation. We'll also find out who the three mysterious witnesses are that will be testifying. Here comes Mr. Pine now. Sir, yesterday, Senator Dempsey made a statement that he intends to have his three witnesses appear before the sub-committee hearings to be held next month. - First, let me say this. I do not believe that Senator Dempsey has any such witnesses. All former Max employees are still loyal to the company and still attend the annual party. - [Reporter] Sir, could you please elaborate on that. - He said we should all give a shit less about that. - [TV Anchor] On the political scene, Senator Dempsey, the man spearheading the investigation into the Max empire, was quoted today as saying, "I intend to force the phantom from his lair." He, of course, was referring to the phantom billionaire, Harold Max, who has not been seen in public for nearly eight years. (growling) (barking) (birds whistling) (suspenseful music) (door slams) (suspenseful music) (thudding) (grunting) - I believe you said $30 a month. I will take one one-hour lesson. - We waited long time for this, huh?

What did you hear from Mauna Loa? - Ask your lady. - Where is he? - Ask her! - Where? (grunting) You really don't know? But I thank you for the lesson. Well, you are next. - Evening, Mrs. B. - Good evening, sir. - Is dinner about ready because I've got a lot a lot to do? - It'll be ready when you are. - Thank you very much. - What's the matter, Haz, one flat? - Why didn't we ever come with a zip, man? - Hardly ever. - I mean, this is, this is really spooky. - Haz, do me a favor. Just drop it tonight. We got a party to go to. - What party? - Yuli and Deli's party. - That stupid costume ball, no way. - Then give them a word. - Let's stop, babe. (soft pensive music) - There you are, sir. - Oh, that's a beautiful piece of steak. - Will there be anything else? - No, thank you very much. - I'll be in my room watching television if you need me. - Okay, good night. - Good night. (clock ticking) (pensive music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (ominous music) (gasps) (ominous music) ("I Love My Sugar Daddy" by Midge Barnett) - Hi. - Hi, I'm Tandeleo. - [Hazard] Tandeleo (mumbles). - [Woman] Are you sure (mumbles) started this way? - [Travassi] Get inside. - What kind of costume is that? No. You would. - Allow me. (liquid burbling) What's happening? ("I Love My Sugar Daddy" by Midge Barnett) - [Guitarist] Thank you, mis amigos. You make a wonderful group.

How about you, pusher? - Hey, look, mister, let's get one thing straight. I mean, if you know my name, you know what it implies. I don't push anything, I just pack it. - [Hazard] For who? - I don't know. (punching) - Don't struck me asshole, or I'll wash your brains down the sewer. Now, who you're pushing for? - [Pusher] All right! Name's Smiley. Joe Smiley. - That's a lot of horse apple 'cause I checked out his apartment this afternoon and he split town. - Well, he's got another place then. Out in the valley.

I want to talk to you for a minute. - Hey, Tony, be with you in just a second, baby. Hey, how's my old pal, Hazard? Oh, good. Be right there, baby. - Okay. - Okay. - What am I gonna do? - Get in the closets. You got no right to treat me this way, man. - We have a big investment in you, Smiley.

Okay, something big is coming down. I mean big. You know what I mean? Big. Someone has paid every pimp, pusher, preacher to split till Monday.

And I see no reason for two departments to investigate the same matter. - Well, I hope they put a dozen of their best men on it. - Enjoy the rest of your vacation, Mr. Hazard. - Captain, can I talk to you for a moment, please? - Excuse me. - I guess that's it. We'll have you dead. Captain Han! - Solved the case already, homs? - That's funny, Hazard, real funny. What would you do if I was to tell you? This is the same broad who was in the car with Wolfe when they picked up Mauna Loa at the airport. - Are you serious? - I'm serious, Hazard. The same broad. - [Capt. Han] What is it, Travassi? - Sir, Tony and I were talking it over, Captain, and being as the duty rosters are slammed now, and I have to stick around couple of days while my jeep is being repaired, I thought maybe I could help him with this one. That's, you know, if it's alright with you. - I did have to pull Detective Stafford off another case. Under the circumstances, Mr. Hazard, I will be foolish to refuse your generous offer. Remove the body. - I don't think I like what I think you're up to, Hazard. - Get your body up the bjorn. See what they have on Mauna Loa. In the meantime, I'll check our old friend, Joe Smiley. (tense music) (children squealing) Hey, dirty old man. - Damn it, Hazard, man, don't do that to me. - Lighten up, Smiley, or you'll have a heart attack or something. Hey, I know you didn't drive me down here to watch a bunch of no-speakers play baseball, so I, hey, share some for me, right? - [Smiley] Yes and no. - What do you mean, "Yes and no?" - Got a match? (gun clicking) - When did you start smoking? (firing) (grunting) Smiley, Smiley. Never thought you had the guts to set me up. - Sorry, Hazard. The heat was too heavy. - Then you don't have anything for me? - Newspaper. (splashing) - Be glad you had Kate with that pool in the White House. - We are ambitious, aren't we? - Nothing when you climb on that political treadmill, there's only one place to get off. - Shall I start redecorating the Oval Room? Sir. (laughing) - Why don't we start with fixing us a drink? - Okay. - Senator, there's a Detective San Hazard here to see you. - [Dempsey] Tell him I'm not seeing anybody. - Okay, I'll handle it. - [Tara] It's like you're already there. - Almost, sweetheart, almost. - The senator doesn't wanna be disturbed right now. He said to call and make an appointment to see him at his office. - Okay, but being as I'm here, I might as well see-- - This way out. (grunting) (clattering) - What the hell is going on? - I'm Detective San Hazard-- - I don't give a damn who you are. What gives you the right to come busting in here? I'll have your job for this. - It sure is. Was Charles Hamilton one of your witnesses? - That's none of your business. - Murder is my business. - Murder? - That's right, I think Charles Hamilton was murdered. - The coroner's report said nothing about murder. - Then he was one of your witnesses. - I'll have to ask you to leave. - I'd sure like to talk to those other two people. - That's impossible. - Senator. - Look, Hazard, I don't wanna have to get bluffed. - I have gone (mumbles). Look, if you change your mind, you can call me at this number. In the meantime, stick those two birds away where God can't find them. Hi, Tara. Glad to see you made it to big time. - Yeah, Jack, Bill Dempsey. Yeah, I'll be needing your services. (tires screeching) - I've got six men, Senator. That's more than enough for a small hospital. - I hope so. I just found out Hamilton was murdered. We've gotta get Smythe out of here today. - He seems strong enough now. Let's move him. - One more, just one more game. - No, Mr. Smythe, you have to take your medication and then a nap. It's not at all that bad. - Hello, Senator. - Hello, Herman. How are you feeling today? - Couldn't be better. I want you to know I'll be out in plenty of time for that hearing. - Good. Look, Herman, we've gotta get you out of town for a few days. If you need anything, just tell Jack. I'll keep in touch. - Okay. - Nurse, let's get Mr. Smythe dressed and ready to travel as quickly as possible. Go tell Frank to pull the car onto the back of the hospital. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) (tense music) (birds chirping) (tense music) - Hello. - [Old Woman] Do I have to go in already? - No, you don't have to go in right now. - Young man, you have to talk at me. I'm deaf, you know. - Oh, I should get down, I'm sorry. - Oh, that's alright. (tense music) (birds chirping) - Would you like to have me take you for a stroll? - Oh, that would be so much fun. But, not too fast. - Oh, no, no. - [Old Woman] This is a rare treat for me. I never get to take a nice stroll. (tense music) - An attendant should know better than to take Sarah out in the sun. (tense music) (grunting) (grunting) (yelling) (gasping) (yelling) (grunting) (grunting) (punching) - I can tell you there from a doctor's point of view. It's very difficult to imagine, huh? Any man couldn't have caused that much damage without a sledge hammer or a baseball bat. I'd say that the cause of death to this man was punctured lungs from splintered ribs. Here, the bridge of the nose was shattered and driven into the brain. Burst sternum, ruptured spleen and kidneys, knee, shoulder, wrist, all broken. - This one was the third man killed. He was the first, second, and he was the last. - I could have told you the cause of death, but never the sequence. What makes you so sure? - The first two were set up. He was quick and efficient. By the time he got to the third, he was getting warmed up. The fourth was his target, complete overkill. Mauna Loa. - What's that? - Hawaii's biggest volcano. It just erupted. - Hi, (chuckles) how's business? - It is doing well. What did you get? - Keep the change. - Thank you. (mellow piano music) ♪ Diamonds - Let me help you. - Oh, thank you. Are you staying next door? - Where would you like it? - Right over there. Did you hear about all the (mumbles) went up at the north on a beach day? They found a girl murdered. She was beaten to death. Just drop it anywhere. I don't know why I don't collect (mumbles) instead. They figured it happened last night, sometime around midnight, because she was still wearing a lovely purple nightgown when they found her. Terrible thing, I heard she was beautiful. Thanks for your help. (waves crashing) - Hey, when did you get back? - Where is Glenda? - I don't think it's any of your business. - I'm making it my business. - Listen, coconut head, you're here to do a job. That's your only business around here. Keep pushing, and I'll break you in half. Is that clear? - It's clear your muscles are in your head. - You, son of a bitch. (grunting) - [Mauna] Now, we start again. Where's Glenda? - She's gone. - Where? - I don't know, we had a fight and she left. - Did you hurt her? - No. - [Mauna] You're dead if you're lying. - I swear I'm not lying. (grunting) (shattering) (screaming) - You liar. (mellow music) - Captain Han, Chief Shaffer and Senator Dempsey are waiting in your office. - Well, Captain Han. Senator, I want you to meet Captain Han. - Captain Han. - I am sure the captain will get to the bottom of things. Good to see you again, Senator. Captain, take good care of the senator. - Senator, please sit down. - Captain Han, I demand to know what is going on. I've lost two of my key witnesses in the past 24 hours. - And where's your third witness now? - He's arriving this afternoon by train. He hates flying. - Who else knows his arrival? - Just my aide. - Where is he? - He's at my house taking care of business. Why? - I think we should go to your house right away. Get me Travassi. - Stanley. Excuse me a moment. Stanley! - The senator seems upset, Captain. - I have a feeling he's gonna be a lot more upset. - That's strange. He hasn't even touched his (mumbles). - [Travassi] Could he have gone out, Senator? - He just wouldn't disappear like that. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) We should have every available man at the depot, sir. - I don't think we should go to the depot. - Now, wait a minute, Captain. I've got my key witness on that train. - We'll pick him up out of town. - [Hazard] Hey, you wouldn't happen to have seen this girl around any place driving around in a blue Mercedes Benz? - Yeah, I think she lives in the third house over there. - Okay, thank you. - Where do you plan on hiding me, Captain? Jail? I wouldn't last the night. - He is right. - I have a better idea. (mellow music) (suspenseful music) (tense music) - [Hazard] That's got to be the 454 Casull. - That, sir. - Let's see what she'll do. - [Man] She's the most powerful handgun in the world. It takes a rifle charge. - [Hazard] Let's give her a try in this gallon can of water. (suspenseful music) (blasting) (suspenseful music) - [Man] His name is Bernard Leighton. He just came in on the Amtrak about an hour ago. The police have him, they're hiding him out. The man protecting him is Han. - [Mauna] (mumbling) From Milwaukee? - That's the one. - Pick me up. - Okay, Han's got three men at the main entrance, two on each of three staircases, and a floater in the garage. Han lives up on the 10th floor, overlooking the bay side. Apartment 1006. No problem until you get to the 10th floor. Then there's one on the hallway, one on the balcony, three inside the apartment, four, counting Han. - And his wife? - Seven. He probably thinks he can hide behind her skirt. He's wrong, isn't he? - Let's go. (suspenseful music) - [Travassi] Hey, where's Lefty? - [Guard] He's on the back rail. He didn't like those ceilings. - [Han] And Mr. Leighton? - He's in the room, he's doing some paperwork. - Darling. You're right. My staying here will only jeopardize your safety that much more. I'll go in my parents' home. - Yes, sir, this will do it. We've got enough here to castrate Max. After tomorrow, I can breathe again. I guess what I really mean to say, Captain, is that I believe in you. - You will live, Mr. Leighton. (ominous music) (soft knocking) - [Midori] I'm leaving now, honey. - [Han] I will take you to your car. I'll be right back. - What's happening, really? - Nothing, I hope. - Tony, who is this dude we're shading? It must be someone special. - Han calls this guy the golden goose.
