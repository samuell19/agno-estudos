Could you hand me my shirt, baby girl? I oughta get going. Come on. Stay a little longer. What about round two? - You for real? What? You all outta mojo? - Hell, you tryin' to kill me, woman? Don't you want to stay with me? You know it, baby girl. But the goats need lovin', too. Folks don't call me Goat Peter for nothing. Very funny. There you go. Hey. Heidi! You've been visiting Goat Peter again! And how was your day? - Look. That boy is trouble, I'm telling you. - Here we go again. Boys his age, they got one thing on their mind. So you just stay away from him before you get hurt. I know, but I just so happen to like him a lot. And I'm old enough to make my own decisions. You know, I only want what's best for you. You're all I have. Can we just eat, Grandfather? They say he's involved in some shady business. They? Who's they? - In the village! How about trusting your own granddaughter's judgment instead of some old hag's gossip? - Heidi! You know what? I'm not hungry anymore. Goat Peter and I love each other. And that's that. My dear, dear Heidi. If only you knew. You the guy? I'm the guy, alright. Straight to business. I like it. Rich, creamy, smooth texture, exquisite taste. This goat cheese is truly out of this world. Nothing like the crap they used to sell in the cities. So it's true what they say about you. Happy goats... make happy cheese. Grüezi, Swiss citizens. This is a special message from our Very Swiss Leader. Today's topic: Nutrition and patriotism. What could be better than delicious, cheesy, traditional Swiss home cooking? Thanks, honey. Smells delicious. And what could be worse than someone who doesn't eat it? Lactose intolerance is a threat from within. One that will smother the Swiss way of life if we allow it to continue. Whenever you observe anyone acting suspiciously lactose intolerant, call 1-800-LACTOSE! I'm doing my part. Your colleague. I'm doing my part. Or your girlfriend. I'm doing my part. Are you doing your part? Keep Switzerland free of lactose intolerance! Call 1-800-LACTOSE! Anonymity guaranteed. This message is brought to you by Meili's Cheese Co. I look fantastisch. Good work, Gutzweiler! - Thank you, my Very Swiss Leader. I'm very proud of the results. It could definitely use some sexy girls, though. Okay. That is enough praise for today. Anything else you have for me? Good news, sir. The French. They are ready to agree to our export terms. But... My Very Swiss Leader. I am... You are one minute and 52 seconds late. This is not Swaziland. This is Switzerland! My sincere apologies. Apologies? You are hereby relieved of your duties. Guards! Anyway. Where were we? The French, sir. They insist on sending a delegation of food inspectors to see if we meet their standards before they make a final decision. You know the French. They love their cheese. Those Brie-eating bastards want to lecture me about cheese? Who do they think they are? Maybe I should invite them to the National Day celebration. So... how is the Ultra Swiss cheese coming along? Ah, very good, sir. I think you will be very pleased with the results. Good. First France... and then... the world! I heard someone ordered fondue. Oh, I love the smell of cheese in the morning. That wasn't so bad, now, was it? Please. No more cheese. I can't take it. I am lactose intolerant. Of course you are. You filthy foreign fuck! Well, who is your supplier? His name is G... G... G... G... G... G... G... G... G... G... Goat Peter. And where can we find this Goat Peter? The Alps. The village above Davos. Tomorrow. Please. I told you what you want to know. You promised to let me go. I did. But first... How about some chocolate for dessert? Goat Peter! There you go. Wait here. I'll be right back. I love you, Goat Peter. I love you too, baby girl. Definitely our goat fucker. This man has been charged with the production, sales and distribution of illegal dairy products. Let this be a lesson to you all. Traitors get what they deserve. Noooooo! And who might you be? Take her away! - Come with us! Meili's gonna love this one. Don't let her get away. Quick! See, what did I tell you? They've been down to the village again. Just wait 'til I give him a piece of my mind. Grandfather! Did you really think you could get away from me? Leave the girl alone. Mind your own business, old man. It's better for your health. I said... leave her alone, Knorr! Or I'll blow your fucking head off. Wait a minute. Alpöhi? Is it really you? - You better believe it. Get on your merry way and forget you ever saw the girl! She's yours? This just keeps getting better and better. Final warning! Your pathetic rebellion failed a long time ago. Grandfather! Don't bother. It's pointless. Where are they taking us? I don't know. My name is Klara. What's yours? Fräulein Rottweiler. This is the one. I'm rather unimpressed. Meili is gonna love her. You'll see. Is that so? Lutz! You are now property of the Fatherland. Welcome to Camp Alpenblick! Next. Next. Next. Well... Open up. As suspected. Lactose intolerant. Guards! Never mind that one. Good. Next. Well, hello. Open! - I'm fine, thank you very much. Don't worry. You're in good hands. I see. Spirited, aren't you, huh? I could do this all day long. What about you? Watch out. The way you were resisting, I was certain that you would be intolerant. Oh. Fresh meat. Just ignore them. This is Rosie. She's all bite and no bark. Me and you, we're going to have a real good time together. Quiet in there! Lights out! I'm gonna make them pay. I promise you. I'm scared. Aren't you? I gotta get out of here. We gotta get out of here. We gotta come up with something. Klara, you hear me? We need to stick together. Even if we managed to sneak past the guards, how would we make it out of here? I mean... We don't even know where we are. We'll find a way. We have to. Quiet! Good night, Klara. Good night. Good morning, ladies. Good morning, Fräulein Rottweiler! Congratulations, new arrivals. You are the chosen ones! As you all know... Schwingen, also known as Alpine Wrestling, is our nation's most popular sport. Today you begin your training! Lutz! As there are some newbies here, we'll start with the basics. You! And you. Into the ring! We start with the basic moves of Schwingen! The "kurz" is the most commonly used grip on the Schwing court. Go! Enough! You're going to kill her! - Alright! Get back in line! Let's see if there's some talent behind that big mouth of yours. You. The next move is the "wyberhaagge". Not only because of its name, it is one of the more spectacular swings. I told you we're gonna have fun. Found any fishes down there? No? Check again! Attention! Stand straight. You, you, you. Out! We'll continue the swimming lessons tomorrow, Bambi. I present to you our Very Swiss Leader, President Meili. Oh. That is what it's like. Not too shabby at all. I'm starting to like this place. Anyway. Knorrli! It's Kommandant Knorr! That's the one. Maienfeld, Adelheid. 24 years old. Granddaughter of Alpöhi. Recently deceased. I took care of that personally... Ooh! Quite the lively one. I like that look on your face. That starry-eyed cluelessness one only find in the Alps. Perfect. I am positively surprised, Kommandant Knorr. I did not expect that from you. Anyway, I have got important things to do. Cow business, if you know what I mean. The girl. I want her to be the main attraction. This'll be the best Schwing fest in years. Of course, sir, I have... I've had it with cheese. Isn't there anything else? Oh, let me check. Oh, no. Just cheese. Take it or leave it. All prisoners pick up your meals. What's the problem, Bambi? I'm not eating that crap. Ooh. Are you suddenly lactose intolerant? Stuff your fat faces with that garbage all you want. I'd rather starve to death than end up as one of you. Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Anyone else wants some? And these two... Take 'em away! How the hell did she get that in here? I have had it with your sloppy strip searches. I expect better. Yes, ma'am, Fräulein Rottweiler. Oh, is that how you want to play it? Very well! In just a few days, you'll be on your knees, begging for cheese. In Switzerland, in Switzerland In Switzerland... What a pain in the ass! Woof, woof, woof. Pugsie! Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof. You truly are insatiable, hm? Woof, woof, woof, woof. Very well. Smell that? All the delicious cheese. Till tomorrow! You've been visiting Goat Peter again. Lunch is getting cold. Smell that? I love you, too, baby girl. Delicious cheese... What are you staring at? Delicious cheese. Lunch is getting cold. Don't you want some? Grandfather? For fuck's sake! I should have you all arrested. I'm sure it's just a... - Matter of logistics. That is what you told me the last time. Yet here we are, you've nothing to show. Some more milk. My Very Swiss Leader, I promise you, your new Ultra Swiss cheese will be ready in time for Swiss National Day. It better be because you are hanging on a really thin thread, Schwitzgebel! Speaking of Swiss National Day... How is the mountain girl doing? - Oh... Very promising. You were right to choose her. Good. You would not disappoint me, would you, Knorrli? I wouldn't dare, sir. You know me. I do indeed. Gentlemen. To world domination! - To world domination! Rottweiler. Finally! Meili is getting impatient. If the girl doesn't deliver at the fest, he'll have our heads on a platter. You are giving me orders, Pugsie? Damn right I am. That almost sounds like you are questioning my abilities. I don't care how you do it. Just make it happen! You know... I'm so glad... that you didn't listen. Because... I'm going to enjoy this... very much. It's party time, bitch. I think she's had enough. Give us a minute, will you? You know... I'm not as bad as you think I am. I really do care about my girls, especially you, Heidi. I only want what's best for you. Sometimes that requires a little bit of tough love. But tough love is still love. Wouldn't you agree? Anyway. I've got you a little something... to cheer you up. Now how about you have a little something to eat? Hmm? What do you say? Such a good girl. I'm not a good girl anymore. Time to leave. Why? - I got keys. Cheese? No, keys! We can finally get the hell out of here! But it's going to be breakfast soon. Wait, what? What the hell are you on about? We gotta hurry. I need my daily cheese so I can be big and strong... and become Switzerland's next top Schwinger for our Very Swiss Leader. For fuck's sake, Klara, snap out of it! Fuck! Goddamn it, Klara, get up! I can't do this alone! I'm leaving. I'll fix this. I promise. Ruthli! This way! There's nowhere for you to run, Heidi. Unless you want to join the rest of your family. What? Your grandfather never told you? I made sure your parents got what they deserve. And now it's your turn. It would be my pleasure to reunite you and to once again see that look on a face I saw when I drained the life out of your whore mother and your deadbeat dad. All your sheltered life in the mountains still led your right into my arms. You know, personally, I couldn't give a rat's ass how much Meili wants you at his Schwing fest. So, which will it be? You do not control my destiny. God damn her! Knorrli, I did not expect you here today. I've got some unfortunate news that I wanted to tell you in person, sir. It's the mountain girl, Heidi. Get to the point. I haven't got all day. She's dead. She's what? Killed herself. Un-fucking-believable! How could you let this happen? You incompetent fuck! How hard can it be, guarding a fucking girl? We couldn't... - Shut the fuck up! We will deal with this later. My Very Swiss Leader, it's a great honor to show you the culmination of my work: Meili's Ultra Swiss. None of this would be possible without your brilliant plan for the future of Switz... - Blow that smoke up your own ass. Are we going to see results or not? - Of course, my Very Swiss Leader. Oh, hello there. Cheesemaster. I managed to increase the lactose proportion to no less than 88%. With this new formula, we can not only reach peak muscle mass upon short term consumption, but also peak cerebral softening, which will result in near total lack of linguistic skills and renders the consumer unconditionally obedient. Good God, spare me the scientific mumbo jumbo! Try speaking like a normal person for once. Well, as you would put it, sir, it's going to make everyone dumb as fuck. Talk is cheap. Show me! - Of course, my Very Swiss Leader. Kari here will have the honor to sample the new Ultra Swiss. Oh... - Go ahead, Kari. Unbelievably delicious. Best I've ever eaten. Well, don't stop now. It's... But it's... It's... It's what? Come on, spill it! Cerebral softening, sir. You also said obedience. I did indeed. Try it. Stand straight. Show me how strong you are. What, what, what, what? No! M... Meili! Do something! - Not him, you idiot! Sir, I... I'm terribly sorry. I promise you, I... - I... love it! You crazy genius! You've created the perfect Swiss super soldier! I guess the position for propaganda minister just opened up. Sir. You can't be serious. This thing is supposed to be a soldier? I don't see how... - Of course you don't. You and your soldiers can't even handle a little girl. The future is now, old man! Produce as much of it as you can! Of course, my Very Swiss Leader. You may leave whenever you please. The weapons, they stay. I am Helvetia, Guardian of the Motherland. Lust for vengeance flows through your veins. Many things you shall learn, young cub. Forget joy, forget sorrow, forget love, forget hate. Follow the whispering leaves and the call of the mountain goat. Meili's blood's gonna boil when he sees that one. I hope he gets a motherfucking heart attack. Easy now! It's only me. Alpöhi? You got some nerve showing up on my doorstep after all these years. Knorr killed your boy. What the hell you talkin' about? Goat Peter? My beautiful boy? And now he's after my Heidi, so I'm going to kill the bastard. And I need your help. You want us three old guys to... go after Knorr, without even knowing where to go, or what we're up against? Is this what you're saying? Exactly. Alright... let's go tear that motherfucker a new asshole. I knew I'd find you in here. As predictable as a good old Swiss watch. My Very Swiss Leader. Stop moping around, Knorrli. There's plenty enough boots left to lick. You actually look pretty good sitting behind that desk. Who knows, I might have to "promote" you to prison warden. What? Relax! I'm just fucking with you. Although... I did tell you to not disappoint me, remember? Of course, sir. My staff informed me that these are the two most promising candidates. That's it. Those two? Is this your idea of a joke? They are fierce warriors and more than... - I wanted the fucking mountain girl. You let her get away. - She didn't get away. She died. - Whatever, Knorrli. This year's fest was destined for the history books. Now it's just... Sir, there is a soldier who insists on speaking to you. Herr... Herr Kommandant! Herr Kommandant. Our patrol was attacked. We didn't stand a chance. Get a grip on yourself, soldier. Now what happened? We were... just finishing lunch. Suddenly there was this noise. That's not a weapon. This is. She... She left me alive to give you a message. She? She said... Death to the Fatherland! Knorrli! Are you telling me she did this? The fucking mountain girl? Not only is she not dead, she's also massacring your goddamn soldiers? This is your last goddamn chance. You better fucking fix this! Summon the Neutralizer. I'm out of ink. Just take the ink pad from the other stamp. What other stamp? Right away. Long live our Very Swiss Leader. - Alright, fuck off! Got you, fucker! Right. This should be the last one. Time for a break. - Well, well, well... Something's yodeling in my pants. I wouldn't push her off my bed, that's for sure. I heard she took down an entire squad. I wish I could be the one to find her. I'd teach her some real good manners, if you know what I mean. That's some real big talk for such puny little boys. Ha! It's my lucky day! Yodel me this! Now that's what I call a swan song. You're coming with me! What the fuck are you supposed to be? Bonjour, gentlemen. It is my great honor to welcome you to our National Day festivities. Bonjour, monsieur le president, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, let me extend our sincere appreciation for inviting us to this event. Mon pleasure. It is a great opportunity to celebrate the dawn of a new era. But for now, relax, eat. We will discuss business later. Super. Splendid. - Excellent. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up to our... Very Swiss Leader, President Meili! Happy Swiss National Day, dear citizens. Today we shall celebrate 20 years of Switzerland's new order! The Meili era! Not even the sky shall be the limit... Hey, Klara! Ladies and gentlemen! I now present you the first Schwing fight of today. Klara! Versus... Rosie and Flora! Let the festivities begin! Yeah! And now, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present today's main attraction. A traitor to her own country. The rebel spawn: Heeidiii! To honor this special occasion, this fight will be carried out using only traditional Swiss weapons. Guys! We don't have to do this. Shut up and fight, traitor! Look what you made me do, bitch! Do it! - Don't you see? We're in this together, for fuck's sake. I am not the enemy. They are. Faster, pussycat. Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! What is she waiting for? Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Just fucking do it, mountain girl! It's not like I've ever been nice to you! Alright, enough of this! It's time to wake up, people! Look at yourselves! You're blindly following Meili and his crooks! All that cheese clogged your brain cells. What about your dignity? Your fucking freedom? Don't you remember how things were before? The lives you lived. The ones you loved? All of that is gone now, replaced by the shallow vision of a spoilt man-child! Is that really what you want? Oh, for fuck's sake, people, wake up! What are you gonna do now, mountain girl? I'm coming for you! You fucking bastard! All part of the show. All part of the show. Do something, Knorrli! Send him in! Say goodbye to your little friends. We're in this together, remember? Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Are you happy now? Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen... it's time for the factory tour. Monsieur le president, we cannot leave now! This Heidi is amazing! My heart is melting like butter on a baguette! Forget about her. The real highlight is yet to come! Now please, follow me! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! There is no escaping fate. No escaping me. You know, given the circumstances, I'd say we've actually had quite some fun together. Don't you think so? But as you know, all good things must come to an end. I'm not done with you. Citizens, behold the fate that awaits a traitor. Say hello to your rotten family when you join them in hell! Oh, not again! Shoot them! You fucked with the wrong Heidi! This is for Goat Peter and all the people of Switzerland you deprived of their freedom. Boo-hoo! My heart is bleeding. You're goddamn right it is. Death to the Fatherland! Fuck you! Long live the Motherland! Heidi! Grandfather! How could you lie to me about my parents? - Heidi, I didn't... I thought you were dead. I hate to interrupt the family reunion, but we're not done here. Shit! Klara! He... He ran into the tunnel. He... Meili! Voilà! Monsieur Meili, you are a genius. What you have achieved here is truly magnifique. C'est mon pleasure. Mr. President. Is there a problem, monsieur Meili? - Oui. Non! Non! Non! Let us celebrate this historic moment. It is a tradition here in Switzerland to have a cheese dessert after signing a contract. Schwitzgebel! I'm proud to present to you the latest creation from our gourmet line. Bon appetit, monsieurs! Formidable! Holy cow! Those sick fucks! Impressive, isn't it? I call them the mother cows. The secret to our new delicious Ultra Swiss product line. Soon the world will be mine! Not if I can help it! Aww, so cute! But it doesn't matter what you do now anyway. Attack! Bon voyage, bitch! Now that's what I call Swiss cheese! Where do you think you're going? Hit it, Ueli! Rest in cheese, bitch. Grandfather! Looks like the fuckers got me this time. Okay, people, let's rig this place. I'm sorry I lied to you, Heidi. I just tried to protect you. I didn't want to lose you too. Just look how you've turned out. I should never have doubted you. I don't care. Just don't die, you hear? It's alright, Heidi. It's alright. This old-timer's time is up. Oh, I'm turning into one of those things! Ueli! Come on, let me take care of that. My Heidi, I'm so proud of you. Now go! I think I'll just stick around here. Just for a little while. Goodbye, Grandfather! Alright! Get all the women and let's get the hell out of here! Goodbye, old friend. The only good cheese... is fried cheese. It was my wife's, you know? She gave it to Goat Peter shortly before she passed away. I'm glad it's yours now. I will always keep it close to my heart. It looks good on you. I hope it always reminds you of the days in the mountains and that it will preserve that innocence within you. Let's go! You ready to do this? Fuck, yeah! There is no snow in Yokohama There are no ski slopes on Hawaii In Barcelona, no such thing as ski Which is why we let it be And don't leave home at all There is no slalom in Acapulco And no downhill in Corinth On the Bahamas it's too hot That's why we travel not And just stay put where we are... Fuck! Our mountains, they are so lovely So much to do and see... Heidi and Klara will return in... "Heidi & Klara"!
