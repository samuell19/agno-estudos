SOMETHING BORROWED (2011) CD 2/2 Do you remember that night when we were studying for our Torts final? And you were laughing so hard? You know exactly what I'm talking about, don't you? Yeah. Didn't you feel what I was feeling? I did. At least I was hoping that's what you were feeling. Yeah, but, then, that night when I met Darcy... ...I actually thought you set us up. I just didn't think someone like you... ...could ever like someone like me. [CROWD CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] [SIGHS] That's a nice way to wake up. Good morning. I wanna tell you something. Tell me something. I love you. I love you, Rachel. I think I always have loved you. Imagine I'm holding your hand right now. RACHEL: Okay. - You're blushing. MAN: Dexter. Is that...? - That's my parents. - Who's that? I wonder what he's doing. He's not supposed to be in town. Oh, my God. I should go. No, don't. - Dex. - Stay. Well, this is a surprise. Heh, heh. Dex, what are you doing here? We thought you were in the Hamptons. - I had to work. - Mm. Had to work. Mom, Dad, you remember Rachel White. Oh, my gosh, yes. - Hello, dear. - Hi. Good to see you. BRIDGET: Guess who was asleep in the box with his head on the pillow next to Buddy. Little Dex did not come out of that box for two days. Ha-ha-ha. Dexter, come. Let's walk. - Excuse us, ladies. - Excuse us. Mom, thank you for thoroughly embarrassing me. Appreciate that. My pleasure. [CHUCKLES] Your mother doesn't like me drinking during the daytime. Well, she looks good. She seems happy. She sure does. I don't think I've ever seen her so happy. Must be the wedding. Cheers. Dad, can I ask you a question? Have you ever gone down a road... ...I mean, far down it and... And wondered maybe if it wasn't what you want? What you want. The problem with that expression is... ...it's frequently at odds with what's right. Isn't it? Now, whatever's going on between you and that girl, you stop it. Now. - But, Dad... - No. You know what I'm talking about. That's not the kind of people we are. Yes, sir. Your mom is a sweetheart. Your dad... I see where the strong silent thing comes from. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just tired. Do you wanna come up? I do, but, uh, Darcy texted and they're on their way back, so... - Oh. Yeah. - I should... Rachel, just so you know... ...what I said this morning... Yeah? I meant it. That's what he said? It's complicated, Ethan. Don't. Don't what? Rachel, it's not complicated. He's being a dick. To be honest, you're being stupid. - Whoa. I'm being stupid? - Yes. He's stringing you along. And the worst part is you're just letting him. How long are you gonna let this happen? His wedding day? - His first anniversary? - He's not even married yet, Ethan. Exactly, Rachel. He's not even married yet. Which means he can change his situation anytime he wants. But he hasn't, has he? Have you even seen him, have you even talked to him since the Fourth of July? Rachel, when did you become one of these women that just waits? And is still waiting. I don't exactly see you living your happily ever after. Maybe you're right. But at least I try. At least I take chances. When? When is the last time you took a chance? Two days ago, when I decided to move to London. - What? - Yeah. I'm moving there in the fall. When were you gonna tell me? Um, today. Just now, actually, before you yelled at me. There's a publisher who's really interested in my book. She wants to work on it. Ethan, that's incredible. Hey, you wanna give me a killer going-away present? - What? - Tell your boyfriend to make a decision. MARCUS: Nice, Justin. I'm okay. BOY 1: Oh, nice one! Hey. Hi. MARCUS: So I'm lying in bed last night... ...thinking about you, wondering if I should jerk off or not. But the thing was, I couldn't get it up. And that never happens, by the way. Just FYI. Never happens to me. And it wasn't because I don't think you're hot. I do. I totally think you're hot. I just feel... I don't know. I associate you now with failure. [RACHEL LAUGHS] How do you make the most hideous things sound charming? - That's a compliment, right? - Sure. Ha-ha-ha. So how big you think it is? Excuse me? Oh, my God. The house. You think it'll be big? What house? The house that Dex's old man is buying for him and Darcy. What, Darcy didn't tell you? Yeah, yeah. My dad is Dex's dad's realtor. They're... Right now, they're out in Westchester... ...looking for $2 million mansions. Must be nice, huh? DARCY: Gorgeous. REALTOR: Oak floors throughout. This is the study. DARCY: You look good in here, babe. REALTOR: Hand-cut Vermont fieldstone. Watch your step. Natural light to the left. Southern exposure to the right. So how many kids you planning to have? As many as Dex's father tells me to have. - This is amazing. - Isn't it great? DARCY: We love you so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hmm. So Dex? What do you think? It's great. [CHUCKLES] [TELEPHONE RINGING] - Hello. - Hey, you little tart. Marcus just texted me. He said you guys saw each other today. So spill the beans. Circumcised? When were you gonna tell me about looking at houses? How did you know? Oh, Marcus's dad. Um, it wasn't, like, a little secret. Wait till you see this house that we loved. Oh, my God. We loved it. We haven't decided anything yet. - Oh, am I on speaker? - Hi, Rach. Hey, Dex. You like the house too? Uh, yeah, it was... It was okay. DARCY: What are you talking about? - We loved it. - That's great. I gotta go. But, Darce? - Yeah. - Yes, Marcus is circumcised. Opposing counsel gave me a two-week extension to respond. Yes, I'll hold. [CELL PHONE BUZZES] [WOMEN CHEERING AND LAUGHING] RACHEL: We only have one night. DARCY: Oh, I know. Me too. CLAIRE: Bye, Rachel. - Night. Bye. - Good night. Good night, Darcy. - Air, air. Darce, where...? Where are you going? You know what? I'm gonna sleep over at Rachel's tonight. Oh, come on. We haven't had a sleepover in, like, forever. And, plus, Dex is gonna be out with all his bachelor buddies all night. Oh. Okay, bye. DARCY: Love you. So, what's going on in Marcus-land? You gonna marry him? Stop it. What? Marcus isn't marriage material? [TELEPHONE RINGING] Who is calling at this ungodly hour? - Who is it? - Hello? Rachel, it's me. Please, don't hang up. - Rachel. - [WHISPERING] Who is it? I miss you. That's all I want to say. Um... Look, can I come up? I just wanna talk. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Who is it? - Ethan. - Ethan? Ethan? No, it's Dex. I'm downstairs. - Can I see you? - Wait, you're downstairs? No! No, no, no! Darcy's here, so... He's downstairs and he wants to come up at 3 in the morning? Um, I'm gonna... Oh, my God. - Ew. - What? Ew! Ew! Oh, my God. You are having a fling with Ethan? Oh, my God, you're having an affair with Ethan. - I gotta go. - He's downstairs. - No, he's... Oh, shit. DARCY: Ainsley? Oh, Ainsley! Way to go, honey! I didn't know you had it in you, you little shithead! RACHEL: Close the window. DARCY: You little tart. Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell me? Um, you know, it just happened. It just happened. Well, we're gonna celebrate your just happening right now. [SALT-N-PEPA'S "PUSH IT" PLAYING] What are you doing? Oh, come on. - It's your favorite thing in the world. - Darcy, no. No. - Not tonight. - Sixth grade, second place. RACHEL: Not now. We should've won. Get over here right now. I suck. Five, six, seven, eight! [SINGING IN UNISON] Ooh, baby, baby Baby, baby Ooh, baby Salt-N-Pepa's here, and we're in effect Want you to push it back Coolin' by day, then at night Workin' up a sweat Come on, girls, let's go show the guys That we know how to become Number one in a hot party show Now, push it Push it good Push it real good [DARCY CHEERS] Push it good Push it real good [BOTH LAUGHING] People who were friends as kids almost always lose touch eventually. I'm glad we didn't. Me too. And we never will, right? No. I don't think there's anybody who knows me like you. Not even Dex does. Not like you do. It's like you totally accept me. Darce, why are you saying all this? I don't know. But when you're getting married, you start thinking about all your big moments. And you're in all of mine. Me too. Darcy? [DARCY GRUNTS] I have to tell you something. Something I've done. Rachel... ...I love you. And I would never let anyone hurt you, ever. And you wouldn't let anyone hurt me, right? No. DARCY: Rach. RACHEL: Hmm. - Rach. Oh, God. Good morning. Do you think I should marry Dex? What? No, I mean it. Do you think this is a good idea? I mean, nobody knows me like you. And you sort of know Dex too. And you're much smarter than I am. I mean, book-smarter, anyway. But what I'm trying to say is... ...you're not gonna let me do anything dumb, are you? Darcy. No, I mean it, because... Ugh, I can really do... I can really do dumb shit. Because I do love him. I do. And I know what he sees in me. What? You know what I mean. He's never met anybody like me... ...because I don't let stuff get to me. Which is true, because I always assume everything'll just work out. And I guess it's because it always has. So I make him lighter, and he kind of... He makes me heavier, somehow. In a good way. Does that make sense? It does. And what you said in your vows... ...I feel that. Especially when you said... Um... What exactly did you say again? - Life without him would be unimaginable. - Yes. And it would. But is that enough for a marriage? I think... Yeah? You should marry him. I love you so much. I love you, Darcy. You are the best girlfriend in the world. Ever. So it's okay that I kind of cheated on him a little bit? What? L... Just barely. Heh. Once. - With whom? - Well, he was a guy from work. And it was nothing. You know me, it was just sex. And I felt terrible, so that's good. Right? Plus, Dex hasn't had sex with me since before the Fourth of July. Ugh. I'm so happy I got this off my chest. I hate feeling guilty. I hate it. I feel so much better now. Oh, my God. So when are you gonna tell him? Do you want me to tell him? I would love to tell him. It's none of your business. I told Darcy to marry him. I'm bowing out. She just told you she's cheating. You want your opportunity, take it. Ethan, stop. I don't really get it. I don't get how you let her win all the time. Wow. Oh. No, "wow" nothing. If the tables were turned, you think she'd let you win? Will you stop? What is it with you two? Why do you hate her so much? What? I don't hate her. I hate the fact that you yield to her at every turn. So why do you do it? Why do you let her win? Because that's what Darcy does. Darcy wins. She always has. She sees things, she wants them, she gets them. Ethan, she got into Notre Dame. Do you know how hard it is to get into Notre Dame? It is impossible. But she did. And with her grades? You're kidding, right? You're not kidding? Did you see her acceptance letter? - What are you talking about? - Did you see the acceptance letter? I didn't. Remember when she asked Michael Jordan to prom? They sent a letter saying he couldn't make it. How many times did she show us that letter? I could recite it right now. That was a rejection. Do you really think if she were accepted... ...that she wouldn't make us memorize that letter too? Rachel, come on. She never got into Notre Dame. Rachel. Okay, look, I get it. You're in a tough spot because you love him. But you gotta do something about it. He's a coward. If he breaks your heart, I'm gonna take a swing at him. - Then I'm gonna let him beat me up. - I gotta go. I'm late. I know! Rachel, that's the point. Be late. Better yet, quit. At least it would be a decision. Rachel! You're all going to hell anyway, so you might as well do something for yourself. For once. Rachel, you deserve to be happy. Then butt out. That would make me happy. I'll figure it out on my own. Oh. Oh, that's great. Let me know how that goes. MARCUS: Serve is up. All right. DARCY: Whoo! DEX: Go! Yes! Five-zip. We're killing you, Rachel. Isn't that the truth? It is, right? MARCUS: I'm really competitive, so I need you to focus. You gotta pop it, Rach. Pop it. - It's a backhand. - Serve's up. Here we go. Go, Dex, do it. - Aah! Oops. MARCUS: Yeah! Who doesn't love badminton? Have you ever even played a sport in your life? I think she's calling you gay, son. - I heard it. DARCY: Hey, Romeo. Why don't you get up off your ass and come help out your Juliet? - What? - Darcy. Your secret lover. Wink, wink. RACHEL: Darcy. - Rachel shared your secret. Oops. Oh. Oh, wow. We're sharing secrets now. See, I didn't know we were at that part of the day, but I am in. - Ethan. - This sounds like fun. - Give me this. Let's do this. - The novelist wants to play. I got an idea. How about it's us versus you guys... ...but we'll do a secret for every point? - Love that. - Ethan. Stop. Gotta do this. Here we go. - Don't. - I love it so much, I'll serve first. All right? Hit me, Dex. Dex, hit me. His name rhymes with sex. You know that? I knew that. ETHAN: I'm so happy to be here. Ready? [RACKETS THWACKING] Yes, do it again. Whoo! Yeah! Yippee! We got a point. I got a secret. Rachel and Ethan are having sex. - Ugh. - What? DARCY: I was there the other night... ...and somebody showed up for a little booty call. I knew it. I called it, I knew it. What? You told me you were gay! That makes more sense. I think that things are getting a tad competitive. - Why don't we just take it down a notch? - No. Honey, serve. Rachel's right. Why don't we...? No, no, no. Let's do this. - Serve it. ETHAN: Do it. DEX: Just... - You know what? Let's keep telling secrets. DARCY: Come on. ETHAN: Serve it! DARCY: Yeah. Serve it, Dex. ETHAN: Serve it, Dex. DARCY: Serve it, Dex. Serve it. Yep. Easy. [GRUNTING] Watch out. - Excuse me. - Aah! - Rachel! - Jesus! ETHAN: Come on, Dex! Okay. Yeah, really? I got it. - There you go. Yeah. All right. - Ethan, stop. No. Let's hear a secret. Rach, why don't you do this one? Come on, guys. I think we're done here. - No, Dex. We're not. - Ethan, stop it! - What is going on? - Lf she's not gonna tell you, I will. Okay, here we go. [SHOUTS] [MARCUS LAUGHING] Shit. What the hell was that? Me? You broke my nose. I'm sure I didn't break your nose. God. And what is all this about us having sex? Jesus, Rachel, just leave me out of your goddamn soap opera. No one asked you to get involved. Really? So why have I been listening to this bullshit all summer? Rachel, do something, because this is just pathetic. But you know what? At the end of the day, you deserve each other. He's never gonna do anything. You're never gonna ask him to, and let's be honest... ...you and I both know that, even if you did, she will never let you have him. - You're an asshole! - Yeah, maybe I am! But I'm the only asshole here who gives a shit about you! [MELLOW POP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] DARCY: I wanna know what it is you're not telling me. DEX: There's nothing to tell. If you wanna know something... DARCY: I'm sorry, that's weird and bizarre. And I'm asking you. I don't wanna talk outside. He's not really gay, is he? No. Uh, Claire, we're not having an affair, either. That was just a... It was... He's never gonna love me, is he? I don't think so. Least I tried. Right? Yeah. Ethan's... Like I said, I think it's weird too. DARCY: Whatever. - You told Ethan? - No. He guessed. Darcy's upset. She keeps asking me what happened on the beach today. You know what? Work it out with her, Dex. Well... Rachel. Rachel. Rachel, what am I supposed to do? Forget what you're supposed to do, Dex. Do what you wanna do. Live your own life the way you want to live it. You wanna teach? Teach. You don't wanna be the man who lives in the big house you hate? Then don't be him. Or do. Just decide. [CROWD CHATTERING] [DEX & DARCY LAUGHING] - That was awesome. - What? Nothing. You've got a great laugh. Wait. When did this happen that you were like, "I wanna be a lawyer?" Who says, "You know what I wanna do when I grow up? I wanna be a lawyer. " I'm sorry. I'm gonna take off. Where are you going? Come on, sit down. I'm beat. This week has done me in. I'll take you home. - No, you don't have to. - No, it's fine. I'd like to. Stop it. You two stay. I'm exhausted. - Darcy, I will call you in the morning. - Okay. Dex, you were incredible this week. I owe you one. DEX: Rachel. Rach. Hey. What's up? I just... I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Okay with...? Well, with this. Oh, yeah. Totally. No, Darcy's fantastic. And, hey, you never know where it might lead, right? Yeah. Okay. Well, good night. Good night. [THUNDER BOOMING] RACHEL: Dex! Dex! - Dex! - What's wrong? I shouldn't have left. - No, it's okay. I understand. - No. Six years ago. That night. I shouldn't have left. It wasn't okay what happened. - None of it was okay. - Rachel... No, no, no, let me say it. Cancel the wedding. Tell her you can't marry her. I love you. I've always loved you. And I should've told you a long time ago, but I'm telling you now... ...before it's too late, before it's really too late. You're not the only one who hasn't been living his life. I haven't either, but I wanna live it now. And I wanna live it with you. I can't, Rachel. I'm so sorry. I can't. [TELEPHONE RINGING] ETHAN [ON RECORDING]: Hey, it's Ethan. Leave a message. Cheers. [MOUTHS] I'm sorry. Wow, thank God you said sorry first, because that would've been embarrassing. - Heh-heh-heh. Hi. - Hi. - Wow. Are you trying to make me cry? - Heh, heh. Hey, so totally not a big deal, but, um, why are you here? I, uh, just needed to get away. This close to the wedding? Darcy must be freaking out. You're where? It is one week before my wedding, Rachel, and you're in London? RACHEL: I know. Um, I, uh... I just need some time. You're my maid of honor. - And you needed time? - It's Rachel? DARCY: Are you kidding? - I, um... Rachel, Rachel, the band you picked sucks. The caterer is a nightmare. You need to get back here right now. Right now. - Darcy... - Right now! No. Wow. What the fuck? Do you need me to be your maid of honor? Oh, my God. I can do it. I have dreamed about Darcy getting married almost my whole life. But I don't know how to stand next to them while they promise those things. While she says my words. I still say you should've told Dex she was cheating. No. And, besides, I didn't want him to pick me by default. I wanna be someone's first choice. Yeah. You are. No, I know what you're saying. I'm not his first choice. Maybe you're someone's first choice. What? You never wondered about me? I don't know how to say this. Um... God, Rachel, I like you. I've always liked you. And when another guy came in the picture, I liked you even more. You are home for me. Wow. That sounded crazy. Heh. Wow. And that's probably what all this is. I mean, it's probably just crazy. It's not... It's not love. Even though it kind of feels like it is. Don't worry, I... My love's not really the overwhelming kind. Jesus, when I'm in love, I, uh, drink ros? and watch Remains of the Day. So... I don't know, Rachel. Maybe it's just that I... Maybe it's just that I miss you. But I think you fell in love with someone else. And I think you still are. [CHUCKLES] Oh, damn it. - I knew I should've gone for Claire. - Ha-ha-ha. - You still have a pump in every color. - Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, every night, I put on my princess outfit. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [DOOR OPENS] Oh, good, you're up. Hey, Ethan? I'm going back. Yeah, well, I think you and I both knew you weren't gonna miss that wedding. No, I'm not going back for her. This isn't who I am. I can't do whatever I want and not care if I hurt anybody. Besides, Darcy didn't do anything wrong. I did. Rachel, I can't hear this "Daddy hits me because he loves me" stuff anymore. No, this isn't me being pathetic anymore. I have always thought it was Darcy who took things from me... ...but really it was just me who was giving everything up to her. And Darcy may be... ...whatever Darcy is. I don't know what Darcy is, but she is my best friend. And I want to be there for her. So I'm going to that wedding. Then you win. How did you, uh...? Called your office. I wanted to be here when you got home. You have to go. I can't do this anymore. She deserves better. So do you. So do I. I called off the wedding. I told her I couldn't marry her. When? Couple hours ago. What did she say? What did she do? She's pretty upset. Mostly about what people are gonna think. Then she threw a few things. Did you tell her about us? She asked if there was someone else. I said no. Because I'm not sure yet if there still is. I don't know what to say. I don't expect anything. I don't deserve to expect anything. I was afraid of hurting people. And I just want to thank you... ...for finally asking for what you wanted... ...and for helping me to do the same. I want to apologize... ...for being such a moron outside that bar six years ago... ...and outside the Jetty last week... ...where I made the worst decision of my life. Basically, you and I shouldn't have conversations outside bars anymore. [BANGING ON DOOR] DARCY: Rachel. Open up. - Darcy. DARCY: Yes. Open the door. How did you get into the building? DARCY: There was a pizza guy and he let me in. Who cares? Open the door. I need to talk to you! Yeah, um... - I'm just changing. DARCY: Ugh! I've seen your ass. Open the door. I called off the wedding. - You did. - Well... ...technically, Dex said it first, but I was thinking the same thing. Wow. I think I need some air to process that. Wanna go for a walk? No. I need to sit down. - Before I tell you what I came to tell you... - Okay. ...I just wanna say that I'm not the only one of us... ...who's being dishonest here. - What have I been dishonest about? - Please. Give me a little credit, Rachel. Claire told me you were lying about Ethan. I know for an absolute fact that you are not sleeping with Marcus. So, what, you're making up stories to make me jealous? You know I'm more sexual than you. I always have been. I wasn't e... And there was never a... How did you know I never slept with Marcus? Well, um, you said he was circumcised. - Okay. - And he is not. Marcus is the guy you slept with? That's what I wanted to tell you. - Can you get me some water? - Wait, when? When did you sleep with him? Fourth of July. Well, we were both lonely, and we were both drunk. [FLOOR CREAKS NEARBY] And we both felt awful afterwards. I mean, we promised right then and there that we would never do it again. And we broke that promise, because we did it again. A couple times. You slept with him more than once? Oh, God. Marcus and I have a... Sit. Okay, Marcus and I have an extremely powerful connection. It's like... ...genetic. Genetic. Chemical? Whatever. I'm not a word person. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, I'm gonna need you now more than ever. I took a test. You're pregnant? I am. It's crazy. I mean... And good. I mean, Marcus has been amazing. He is not what you think. Yes, yes, he's a caveman, a total caveman. But one time, he made a little splint... ...for this little chipmunk with a broken leg. Is that not the sweetest thing you've ever heard? Yeah. I gotta go. He's downstairs. He's waiting. But I love you so much. It's crazy... ...how things work out sometimes, huh? Bye. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Is that Dex's jacket? What is it doing here? Oh, he just left it at the restaurant. I must've picked it up. No. No, he didn't, because he was wearing it today, so... What is it doing here? What is it doing here? Darcy... Where is he? Darcy. Where is he? Where is he? Dex? - Darcy. Please, let's just... - Dex! Dex? - Dex? - Darcy, no! Dex! - You liar! - Are you kidding me? You told me there was nobody in... You are pregnant! Are you pretending you're the wronged party here? Rachel? How could you do this to me? I never wanted to hurt you, Darcy. I never wanted to hurt you! - Rachel! How could you do this to me? - Darcy, I never wanted to hurt you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I never wanna speak to you again! Ever! Dude, you suck. I'm telling Mom. Wish me luck, dude. Hey. You look good. I know. Clearly, I'm gonna be one of those girls who only carries in my belly. I bought him that shirt. Darcy, I'm really sorry. You're really sorry you slept with my fianc?? No, I'm sorry I hurt you. You always were jealous of me. Ever since I got into Notre Dame. You're right. Darcy, I miss you. Every day. You know, I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life... ...so whatever. I'm glad. Rachel? I am, though. Happy. Good. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hey. Where are you? I'll take this. [BELLS GONGING] What'd I miss? What did I miss? Okay, okay. DARCY: Ethan. Ethan. Ethan. Ethan. Ethan? Ethan! Subtitle Rip; TheHeLL
