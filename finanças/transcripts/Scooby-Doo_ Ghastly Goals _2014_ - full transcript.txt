(CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING) Wow! Brazilians really love soccer. There's the Most Valuable Player. VELMA: He scored three goals at the last international soccer cup in South Africa. (CROWD CHEERING) Hmm. Hmph! He looks like he's hiding something. -We should investigate. -(CHEERING) Yeah! We're on vacation, Fred. There are no mysteries on vacation. There are mysteries to solve everywhere, Daphne. We just have to find them -(GULPING) -(CHOMPING) -Like I think it's cool that we've been in Rio -(GULPING) for two days and haven't seen one monster. Me, too. The eyes of the world are on Brazil. -How do you handle the pressure -(BRAKES SCREECHING) of a potentially logistical nightmare? This competion will run more smoothly than any other. (TIRES SQUEALING) Whoa! There's definitely something up with that guy. Aside from his reckless driving habits? That's Julio Luna, the director of the games. -(STOMACH GROWLING) -Huh? Like, dude, I'm starving. -Let's find some more food, Scoob. -Long sticks! -(SCOOBY-DOO GRUNTS) -SHAGGY: Whew! -SCOOBY-DOO: Huh? -(SIZZLING) (SLURPING) (CHUCKLING HAPPILY) Where do we start, Scooby-Doo? Shaggy! Pancakes! -(SCOOBY-DOO PANTING) -Look out! (SHATTERING) Our ball! I'll get it. (SNIFFING) (GROWLING) -(DOG BARKING) -Hmm? (WHIMPERING) Hmm. (SNIFFING) Hmm. (PANTING) -(GROWLING) -(GULPING) (SNARLING) (WHIMPERING) (SNARLING) (SNARLING) (THEME SONG PLAYING) (WHOOSHING) (CHEERING) (WHIMPERING) (SNARLING) (SPITTING) (SNARLING) Would you like one? (EXCITEDLY) Oh, would I? Oh! How many do you want, Scoob? -(SCOOBY-DOO PANTING) -Scoob? -Huh? -SCOOBY-DOO: Shaggy, run! Run? But pancakes. -(YELPING) -(GROWLING) On a stick. -Monster! -(SCREAMING) Yikes! (SHRIEKING) -Ahhh! -SCOOBY-DOO: Yikes! Shaggy! Hey, come back with our ball! (SIGHING) (SNARLING) (CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING) My contract is very specific. Anything other than stadium shows means it's an extra fee. That includes parades. Keep your head on. We're trying to findSenor Luna. He will straighten this out. (YELLING) Gangway! (GROWLING) (YELLING) I'm the lead mascot. (CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHING) That is the fifth float with soccer players bouncing balls off each other. Yeah. It's like a hottie parade. -(SCOOBY-DOO PANTING) -(SHAGGY SCREAMING) -(SCREAMING) Ahhh! -(GROWLING) Whoa! What is that thing? And why is it chasing Shaggy and Scooby? (PROCESSING) Does it have horns? No. DAPHNE: Well, one, maybe. A tail? No tail but claws. FRED: Very sharp claws. Is it wearing a vest? It's a serious question. (WHINING) (GROWLING) What's that? (SNARLING) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) Ahhh! (GROWLING) Ahhh! Look! -SHAGGY: Whoa! -(SCOOBY-DOO PANTING) Whoa! What's he want, Scoob? I don't know. (GRUNTING) (WHOOSHING) (WHIZZING BY) (GROWLING) Shaggy, Scooby, are you okay? Where'd the monster come from? Do its feet face forwards or backwards? You'd be surprised at how many Brazilian creatures have backwards facing feet. Well, whichever way his feet face, we have to stop it. Careful. It could be playing possum. Hi, guys, someone should be checking out the churros stand, too. Like us. (SNIFFING) (GROWLING) Huh? (SNARLING) (WHIMPERING) -(SIREN BLARING) -Huh? (GROWLING) ALL: Huh? (WHIMPERING) Like, so much for our vacation, Scoob. -SCOOBY-DOO: It's so tragic. -SHAGGY: I know. It's like a snack apocalypse. Senor cao, did you find our soccer ball? Someone came and picked them all up. But we must get it back. It was given to us by the great player, Mario Diego. He used my green pen. -Eshu. -Gesundheit. No, Eshu. It's the name of a mythological creature. -He's a trickster of sorts. -Si. Eshu tries to cause trouble. Like, he's very good at it. We'll get your ball back. -And there is the man who can help us. -(VEHICLE APPROACHING) Wait, sir. Mr. Luna. Everything is running smoothly. There are no problems. Where are all the soccer balls? Taken back to the equipment room. To keep them out of the thieving hands of street ruffians. You see, they are match balls. -Now, American children, I must go. -(ENGINE REVVING) -Panic awaits! -(TIRES SCREECHING) Match balls? They're made just for these games. (CHOMPING) (DOOR OPENING) The equipment room should be down here. (RATTLING) SHAGGY: Zoinks! There's like a gazillion balls! I guess they don't wanna run out of them. It looks like we'll have to go in. Okay, but let's be orderly. (YELLING) Cannon ball! -Whoa! -Whoopee! (GRUNTING) (SIGHING) Forget it. (INHALES) Hmm? Remember, we're looking for the one with green writing on it. (SNARLING) (LOW GROWLING) Hmm? SCOOBY-DOO: Hmm. I found it. (CHUCKLING) How'd you find it so fast, Scoob? Super sniffer. (SNIFFING) Yuck!>Yuck! (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (TEETH RATTLING) (YELLING) Don't lose the ball! Too late! (GROWLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WHIMPERING) (SCREAMING) Ahhh! -(BOTH SCREAM) -(SHAGGY WHIMPERS) Eshu! (ALARM BLARING)) SCOOBY-DOO: No! (GROWLING) Huh? Ahhh! Ahhh! -He's gone! -We'd better go, too. JULIO: Call for reinforcements. I want security doubled, patrols tripled. (ANGRILY) And, no more TV! Looks like we lost our chance to get the ball. You know what I think? I think Eshu wants the same ball. But why? You sure this is the first place you saw the monster? Yeah, over there. Like, what are we looking for? Anything out of the ordinary. What about this? There's a label on it. "Property of Professor Eduardo Perez." VELMA: He works atthe El Cordobesresearch lab. Hello, we're here to see professor... What is your business here? We need to talk to Professor Eduardo Perez. Not without identification. We have identification. Hmm? (CHUCKLING) The professor is a very busy man. We need to see him now. We found this test tube. That is the property of El Cordobes lab. Give it to me. A test tube? We found this in an alley. You should all come with me. Dr. Riganto. They must have an appointment. They have one now, Reynaldo. Hee-hee. (GRUMBLING) I must warn you. Professor Perez is a bit of an eccentric. (MACHINE BUZZING) (CIRCUITS SCRAMBLING) Professor? -Ah! -(MACHINE WHIRRING) (CLANKING) (BEEPING) Success! (GULPING) Ahhh! Oh, there's nothing like the first cup of coffee in the morning. Are these our new junior scientists? Professor, they found the test tube. Oh, my goodness. This is not good at all! -Where is the liquid that was inside of this tube? -FRED: We don't know. It was already empty when we found it. (SHRIEKING) Oh! This is spectacularly ungood, junior scientist. You see, this very test tube was stolen yesterday by some kind of monster! How do you know it was a monster? (STAMMERING) It's from our security footage. (BEEPING) SCOOBY-DOO: Eshu! Gesundheit. This liquid, what does it do? Dr. Riganto, let's show them. EDUARDO: The stolen test tube was filled with this liquid. We call it boundium. Now watch. (CHUCKLING) (WHIZZING) It will bounce forever! You see, boundium modifies the quality of rubber. (WHIZZING) Professor, shouldn't we be stopping it now? Ah, of course, yes, yes. This is always the hard part. Don't worry, Scooby spent half his life catching balls. (SNARLING) (THUDDING) (CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLING) Great catch, Scoob. (MUFFLED) Thanks. That stuff seems dangerous. It is a bit unstable. The longer it is in contact with rubber, the more powerful it becomes. (CROWD CHEERING) So, Eshu stole the boundium which was spilled on the kid's soccer ball. If the thief gets the ball back, he can extract the formula and sell it to whatever buyer he's lined up. And that is why we have to sneak back into the equipment room. -You sniff it out yet, Scoob? -Uh-uh. It's not here. But it's gotta be here. I don't know, Fred. There are less balls here than before. Which means, if it's not here, they must have taken it to the game! ALL: Huh? (CROWD CHEERING) (SCOOBY-DOO PANTING) (BOTH PANTING) Hmph! (CHUCKLING SHEEPISHLY) (WHINING) DAPHNE: There it is! Like, guys, what do we do now? We could tell Julio Luna. Unless, Julio Luna is Eshu. Freddie's right. We'll have to do what we always do. Sneak around and defy authority. But how do we get down on the field? (CROWD CHEERING) We need to find the other end of that tunnel. Come on. I bet those stairs will get us there. (SCREECHING) (TUT-TUTTING) Just where do you children think you're going? Like, we thought this was a shortcut to the, uh... Uh, snack bar. (RINGING) Yes? MAN ON PHONE: And there issomebody who released thebaboons and they're out here. Baboons? No, not baboons! Balloons! I said release the balloons. (SHRIEKING) I'll be right there. (CHUCKLING) You are fortunate I cannot stay and properly reprimand you. Use the regular walkways, will you? There are no shortcuts here. Thank you. Come on. This has to be the tunnel. Eshu! Stop him! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Ahhh! Get off me! Like, what happened to his crazy horn? I am the mascot, you invasive children. -(GRUNTING) -Ooh, like I'm sorry. Look! You bent my shell! I can't go out there like this! Where's my handlers when I need them? (CROWD CHEERING) -(BLOWING WHISTLE) -Whoa! -VELMA: They've just thrown a player out of the game. -(CROWD BOOING) This could be a good distraction. Too late. DAPHNE: They're using a new ball. Like, we gotta get that ball, Scoob. -Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. -Hmm. A-ha! Now we are short one player because you have become blind. You have the dog. -The what? -(CHUCKLING) The rule states that any player still on the field is in the game. The dog is not on my team! Well, he's not on our team. He couldn't hurt, Juan. We only have 2 minutes left to win. Then we accept the dog. (BLOWING WHISTLE) (WHOOSHING) (GRUNTING) Hua! Huh? Oh! (EXCLAIMS) (YELPING) ANNOUNCER: Goal! (CROWD CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: Brazil wins! Thanks to, uh, him! -Yay! Woo-hoo! -Yes! Woo-hoo! -He did it! -Way to go, Scooby. Hmm? -(ESHU GROWLING) -(TEETH RATTLING) (ALL GASPING) Huh? (ALL GASPING) Huh? (TEETH RATTLING) Huh? -(GRUNTING) -(WHIZZING) Whoa! Now let's see who you really are. It's Reynaldo! DAPHNE: The guard from the research lab. VELMA: Jinkies, of course. The high security at the lab meant that the theft had to be an inside job. And he was hostile towards us from the beginning. He must have recognized us from the parade. Like, why did you steal the formula? For the money, of course. (SIGHING) REYNALDO: When I was a child,I wanted to be a magicianmore than anything. But I came from a familyof security guards. So that was my destiny. Even as an adult,I longed to be on stage. But a magic actis very expensive. How could I get the money? And then, I learnedabout the professor'ssecret formula. (WHIZZING) It could be worth millions. By using a costume, not only wouldI conceal my identity. But I could becomepart of the paradeto cover my escape. Then came the accident,the formula was nowon the ball. But the dog wouldfind it first. (SNIFFING) I had to get it back, so I could sell the formula. And I would have, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your soccer stinking dog. When Professor Perez removes the formula, there are some boys who would like their ball back. Oh, I assure you, we will make sure it is returned. And can I tell you, you have not only saved the international soccer club, but this fine animal has won the game for Brazil. And we would very much like to show our gratitude. (GRUNTING) (GIGGLING) (CHOMPING) -Like, this worked out just right, Scoob. -(GULPING) They got their ball back. (CHOMPING) And we get all the pizzas on a stick we can eat! (CHUCKLING) -(CHOMPING) -CHILD: Look out! (GRUNTING) (GIGGLING) (SIGHING HAPPILY) Scooby-Dooby-Doo! (CHUCKLING) (CHOMPING) Mmm.
