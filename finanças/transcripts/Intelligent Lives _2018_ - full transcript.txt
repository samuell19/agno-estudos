Our son, Jesse, had cerebral palsy and could not speak. When Jesse was four, the neurologist told us - in front of our son - that he would never be intellectually normal, and we should be thinking about having another child. When he was six, the Special Education Director at our local school district said we should send Jesse away to Massachusetts Hospital School. That is not what we did. We fought to have Jesse included in general education. During the struggle, the school insisted that Jesse take the Stanford-Binet IQ test. The test contained absurd, antiquated questions like, "Jesse, do you 'dust' a dresser?" And Marianne and I are thinking, "Dust?" My wife and I don't dust. We call dressers "bureaus." And anyway, dusting wasn't a chore I had thought to give to my child with quadriplegia. Jesse learned to use a computer to communicate. He learned to read, and he developed close friendships. Jesse became a straight-A student in high school. He wrote poetry and he aced every one of his Latin tests. The IQ test told us nothing about my child's potential, about who he was as a person. Can any attempt to measure intelligence predict a person's value or ability to contribute meaningfully to the world? IQ testing is still used in 49 of 50 states as one of the ways to determine if a student will carry a lifelong label of intellectual disability. Only 17% of students with intellectual disability are included in regular classrooms. 6.5 million Americans have an intellectual disability. Only 15% are employed. There are different ways. Better ways. [cafeteria chatter] Naieer has a style of his own and he's not afraid to go in there and freely draw and express himself, and capture line and color and movement. If I got half of that from some of my other students, I'd be happy because that determination he has, it's in him - he cannot give that up. He has to do it. What are we doing? So what color do you need for that? Um, it looked like orange. Orange? Alright. That's the orange you want? When he gets frustrated, it's because he has a hard time communicating his idea that he has in his head. He just gets - his body takes over. Ok. Alright? Alright. Sorry. That's alright, buddy. I gotcha. It's ok. Do you need help? Ummm... What are we doing? Are we going to mix up the brown paint? Yes. Alright, do you see the image now? Yeah. Is it lined up where you want it? Yeah. What are you going to paint that makes you happy? What are you going to tell me? Show me. I don't know what Naieer's IQ is. What I do know is that Naieer is a committed, hard-working student who has some challenges. Black people lived in one neighborhood; Asian people lived in another neighborhood - We work with Naieer and his family, his friends, his teachers to try to help him be the most successful he can be. - and that's just the way it was. We don't use IQ tests to inform us at all. It's a number, but I wouldn't even know where to find it. She's white. She's white? Yeah. Is she a human or a mermaid or what? Ummm... A mermaid? You don't know? No. [birds chirping] So I texted Samantha and she texted me around 3:30 and said she was home sick. Oh well. Maybe I'll text her tonight. Say, oh, how are you feeling? How are you feeling? How are you feeling? Yeah, Micah's been going on OkCupid chatting with women. Haha! Samantha, she's 25 and lives in Syracuse, New York. Down the road, maybe I'll ask her, "Do you want to meet at a coffee shop or something?" [phone reading text] "Hi tomorrow hope your feet I hope you have a good night Samantha." Do you want me to take a look at that, Micah? Yeah. Feet? What did you say? "I look forward to talking with you tomorrow?" Yeah. To talking...and you haven't told her yet about your disability or anything like that? No. I just don't want to like tell her over a text message. Right. It might be good before you guys meet. That's my opinion at least. Maybe I'll tell her over the phone. Yeah. In like my mind, I like never thought I would ever like move from Michigan after being there like my whole time. But it was scary the first couple weeks, but I knew that I made a good decision because I just knew that if I lived in Michigan my whole life, I wouldn't have been able to try something new. And I knew because of me, of being Micah, I knew that it was gonna work out. I'm getting a non-degree certificate in Disability Studies. And can we keep in touch after we graduate? Yeah, of course. You guys are in the serious home stretch. We have two and a half weeks. Ok, lemonade. Food or not food? No. Why not? It's a drink. It's a drink. He was very engaged. Any time I looked in his direction, he had a look on his face that said, "Come on. Keep going. I'm right with ya, and I want to learn this stuff." I don't remember when I was tested, but I like saw a sheet of paper in the mail that said I had a 40 IQ still. And I like Googled what a 40 IQ is and they like said that somebody who can't really like work at like a job or can't like move from their parents' house probably or things like that. The IQ test measures a very limited potential of our brain to learn, and misses all the other stuff. A person's ability to take context, clues from their environment - from other people. A person's desire to engage with other people and their openness to relationships. Micah's got a ton of that. I know. That's huge! One - A quarter. Quarter. The big one. The big one. Now, another one of these. Yeah. Sixty...now three cents. Three cents. Sixty three cents. There you go! I'm smart. You are smart. You're doing it by yourself. How much do I owe you, sweetie?

Naomie, Micah, and Naieer - three young adults with disabilities, unlocking their potential and finding work they love. Would you like to invite her so then she can also see it and you guys can see what it looks like? Not long ago, it was common for doctors and social workers to counsel families to send their children away to institutions. And a child's low IQ was often their one-way admission ticket. Dr. Alfred Binet, the French psychologist, published the first intelligence test in 1905 to identify children that needed educational assistanc. He stressed that intelligence was a fluid quality, shaped by one's environment and culture, and subject to change over time. His intentions were soon distorted. The American psychologist, Henry H. Goddard, altered how the Binet-Simon test was used. He insisted the test was a scientifically valid way to identify the "feebleminded" in our midst. By 1913, the United States government was using Goddard's methods to test 29,000 immigrants a week at Ellis Island. Goddard said the results showed that 79% of Italians, 83% of Jews, and 87% of Russians were feebleminded. During World War I, the military used an IQ exam to determine a soldier's rank. Men who scored lower, were fit to be privates, but not officers. Privates were the most likely to end up on the front lines of battle. IQ testing was used to fuel a pseudo-science known as "Eugenics," which called for eliminating the "menace" of the feebleminded through marriage restrictions, and warehousing of hundreds of thousands of disabled people. By 1950, it has been estimated that more than 60,000 people had been forcibly sterilized. Eugenics had the support of prominent physicians, professors, governors, presidents, and even the United States Supreme Court. Adolf Hitler cited the U.S. Eugenics research as justification for sterilizing and murdering nearly a quarter of a million disabled Germans. Meanwhile so-called "training schools," founded with good intentions as early as the mid-1800s, were established as safe places where adolescents and young adults with disabilities could learn skills and integrate into society. But over time, these schools devolved into restrictive, hospital-like institutions with few opportunities for growth, and little hope for release. Notorious institutions like Willowbrook more closely resembled prisons than schools. And yet, despite its ugly history and inherent flaws, intelligence testing and the resulting IQ score is alive and well. In response to consistent criticism over many years, the tests have been modified enough to retain their status as the standard measure of intelligence throughout the U.S. Research tells us that IQ test results can be biased by factors such as socio-economic status and cultural background. African-American students are almost twice as likely as white students to be classified with intellectual disability. [students talking in the classroom] Do you see it here? Yeah. Yeah? When Naieer first came, his communication skills weren't developed. This is what we have right here, ok? He wasn't able to advocate for himself. Many schools probably would've taken that and said, "That's not for us. Inclusion's not for him." El pelo largo. El pelo largo.

Thousands of mentally disabled Rhode Islanders were paid, in the words of one investigator, virtually nothing. It all stems from an investigation into the treatment of students at the Birch Vocational Program at Mount Pleasant High School in Providence, who were performing manual labor in segregated workshops for little to no pay. These people were robbed of years of productivity, learning, and contributing to their communities. The Harold Birch Vocational School struck us as the height of segregation and low expectations. Their curriculum was placing jewelry on cardboard - instead of math, instead of science, instead of reading. In April of 2014, we reached a settlement agreement with the State of Rhode Island to transform that system to one that prioritized and relied primarily on competitive, integrated employment.

With the whole team of people? Pretty much. They'd never included someone with a disability in the classroom, right? All the time. All the time. They would wonder if Micah was learning anything, and you would be able to show that he learned something. It was so new that it was like reinventing. I feel that way sometimes. How do you make inclusion not just manageable but like you want it to work. But you want it to work like with sanity. [children talking] When I found out the list of students I was going to have this year, I had no idea how challenging it was going to be. James, don't you have work to do? I have a student who's just learning language and two other students with autism. And also 15, 16 other children in the classroom. Ok, first I'll help you take your sweater off.

Ready? What sound? Mmm-ap. Say "ap." Ap. Say "map." Map. Say "map." Map. Kevauna, look, did you draw the circle? Something that I continue to learn over and over again is that Micah's story happened over time. He's not just Micah at 30 years old. He was once five years old. Could any intelligence test have predicted the impact our son's life had on the children who went to school with him? On his best friend, Kyle, now a teacher of English language learners who says Jesse taught him how to draw out a world of ideas from each of his students. Or on Jamie, his middle school girlfriend, who said Jesse motivated her to teach music, helping children to raise their voices in song. On the parents and teachers who hear his story and read his poetry, and then determine to fight harder for inclusion. Since the late 1950s, people with disabilities and their families have organized to push for right, visibility, and access to regular schools. Even America's iconic Kennedy family has lived this story. f Rosemary Kennedy - d and ultimately sent to live in an institution. Her hidden life had a tremendous impact on her family and prompted her brother, President John F. Kennedy, to use the power of his office to create the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. Her sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics to illuminate the presence of people of all disabilitie. Here, at Special Olympics, with seven nations represented, what nation you come from doesn't matter. Tonight we are here for one great reason - to see you Olympians and to celebrate how marvelous you are. [crowd cheering] [crowd chanting] By the 1960s, people with disabilities were becoming their own advocates, speaking up for themselves. And what's happened today is they'd rather put us in jail than to free us from our institutions. What do you want? Freedom! When do you want it? Now! Institutions that warehoused people with disabilities were shut down. I visited the state institutions for the mentally retarded and I think that, particularly at Willowbrook, that we have a situation that borders on a snake pit. The children live in filth - that many of our fellow citizens are suffering tremendously because of lack of attention, lack of imagination, lack of adequate manpower. Attitudes about the abilities and potential of people with disabilities were also shifting. In 1975, every disabled child's right to a free and appropriate education became federal law. Since the 1980s, a theory that each of us has multiple intelligences has been widely accepted. Some people are good in thinking spatially; some people are good in thinking language; other people are very logical; other people need to do hands on - they need to actually explore actively and to try things out. Once we realize that, then an education which treats everybody the same way is actually the most unfair education. In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. I now lift my pen to sign this Americans with Disability Act and say, let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down. And we expect no less of the Supreme Court today. And in 1999, a Supreme Court decision reinforced the ADA as the "law of the land," stating that people with disabilities must be integrated in all aspects of the community, including opportunities for paid work. Everyone's lives depends on it. How you doing? Hi, Ma. Please have a seat wherever you'd like. The reason why we're here today is for a social capital meeting.
