Like I said in the beginning, I ain't gonna fuck with you like that, right? You know, you deserve it, you've been workin' hard. You do it proper. You know what else? You stay here tonight. Your girl, too. You ain't gotta pay for her. I mean, with me, you got all the shit you need, you know that? It could be like that. I'm tryin' to... What are you... what are you talking about? - What do you want? - I'm... I want nothing. I'm just saying that you know, I want you to stay here, you know? You came here, 'cause you needed a place to stay, so I want you to stay here. I wanna take care of you, it's what I do. And your girl, too, you know? Your girl, too, she stays here till you... Till you figure your shit out. All right, yo, tie up, come on. Oh, what the fuck? No, we... we got a place to stay. - Oh, why you lyin'? - We got a place to stay. No, you're fuckin' lying! Why you doin' that shit? Come on. Don't do... don't be like that to me. I'm a good guy right? Right? We've been havin' a good time. Right, girlie? Hey, don't touch her. - I'ma take care of you. - Just... right. - Right? You know that. - I know. - I mean like... - You know that. Yeah. I'm working for you. That's it, okay? - So what? - Just... you don't... - I don't want? - Ne... you don't need... I don't what? You don't need to bring her into this. Yeah, if you want... you want to talk about this, we're talkin' about this right now. Look, these guys, they're gonna take care of her. They'll barely touch her, none of that shit. But this could be thousands of dollars. This could be crazy, though, for you and me, all right? You know how rare shit is? A kid like this that's this fuckin' chill? You know how much money they'll pay for that? You... you just put her in a room with them for a little bit. - Stop. - Huh? - No. - Just listen to me. - No, shut up. - Just listen to me. - Shut up. - No. Gee, no! You're still workin' for me for another three fuckin' hours! So, you shut the fuck up and listen! I'll call the fucking cops right now! Huh? I can rip this kid right out of your junky ass hands. Tell 'em that you've been keeping her in the tunnels in the fucking dark like she don't exist. And then what? You in prison and she's in the fuckin' system the rest of her life? You want that shit? Where you goin', huh? - Where are you goin'? - Les, I'm gonna fuckin' scream. I think you need to sit down and do some of this shit. - You ain't thinkin' straight. - I don't need your shit. - Mama. - I don't need your dope. Yo. I need you to get the fuck out of my way. You need to fuckin' lie down. Come on, lay down. What are you doing? Nikki, come on. Back down, baby, just go over there. Hey, oh. Hey, look here. None of this is for free, all right?

Bye-bye. Um, I... I was just wondering if you had any beds to stay. For the night. To sleep? Yeah, I... just tonight. You don't have a place to stay? Uh, no, we do. We're staying in Staten Island at the Elizabeth Coalition. Um, it's just really far and some of the trains are shut down now, so it's gonna be tough to get over there. Just thought it would be easier, because um... We don't have beds here, Sweetie. Uh... um... We... we... we've just been walkin' around all day. I just thought it would just really help us out if... if... if that was something that... Hey, you don't... you don't have to call anyone. No, no, no, no, I'm... it's just a hotline. No, I... I'm fine. I was j... They will be able to help you out here. No, I was just... I was just... - We're at... - Oh, Sweetie, it's not... - Ma'am, ma'am! - Just take a minute. It's...
