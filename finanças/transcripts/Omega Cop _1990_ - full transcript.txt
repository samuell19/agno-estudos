(wind howling) - [Prescott] Half the world just didn't give a shit. The greenhouse effect was a phrase in the newspapers, and who believed the press anyway? So they kept cutting the rainforest and poisoning the soil and the air until there were so many holes in the ozone layer that it was like a torn-up old fishnet. And everything began to go to hell, especially in the cities, which weren't exactly playgrounds anyway. (wind howling) (gentle dramatic music) - [Caller] Come in, come in. Can anyone out there hear me? - [Mary] This is Central Command. - [Caller] Don't give me that Central Command crap. I've got some information I wanna trade, and I wanna know what you're gonna give me for it. - What do you wish to report? - [Caller] The slave traders are at it again, and I've got the location. Hey, didn't you hear me? What the hell is going on? - Keep the creep talking, Mary. Get as much info as you can. I want those slavers. - Hold on please. I'll see if I can arrange a reward for you. - [Caller] It better be good. My ass is on the line out here. - Tell him you'll give him some food, maybe some fresh meat. If his information's correct, I'll send the goon squad. - Hey, we don't like being called goons. (soft dramatic music) - Oh, you don't like it. Well, I don't like the way you and your three buddies run around in the city up there as if you owned it. And I don't like you. - [John] So? - The world went to hell because of guys like you. - I was only 12 when the world went to pot. - You're still 12, Travis. (chair squeaking) Ah. You know that whorehouse they set up at the old Anderson Ranch on the other side of town? You're probably a charter member. - Yeah, I heard of it. - I want you to take your goons and get out there. They're running a slave market. I want you to bust it up. And hang the auctioneer. (suspenseful music) - Jesus, when are they gonna pull down all those bodies? - I guess they were just too hungry to worry about an electric fence. Anyway, that'll serve to keep everybody else outta here. - [Al] Just creates a hell of an eyesore. - Yeah, if you don't like the scenery, why don't you move back to Acapulco? - [Al] If I could afford to, I would. (soft dramatic music) - Man, the Japanese own Acapulco. They wouldn't let you in there even if you had money. Anyway, in two years Acapulco's gonna look just like this place, a manure pile. Yeah, but I'll tell you what. I wouldn't have minded a couple years in Acapulco. Say about 10 years ago. - Quit your bitching, guys. This is where we're at and when we're at. We're struck with it. - I guess we don't have it so bad. - Travis here, radio check. - Read you loud and clear. Say, do you like oldies? - Sure, I like oldies. Just how old are you? - Just look in your glove compartment. (wind whistling) - Of course I like oldies. - Just think of me when you play it. - And just think of me, Pussycat, when I cut your food rations in half. Now get your ass in gear and get going. - Just so you don't cut my woman allowance. - I might cut that off entirely. Oh, Travis, remember your priorities. You're still a cop.

(gun clicking) - I'll get it done. - Just check it out. No heroics. - I'll be back in five. - Al, be careful. - I'm a whisper in the wind. - Fart in the wind. (Mike laughing) - Only if 100 people come running this way, let the first one go by, that'd be me. (soft dramatic music) - Travis, what happens if this is one of Wraith's auctions? I mean, that's a mean bunch down there. - It'll be a great opportunity. - Opportunity? - Opportunity for what? - Put Wraith and his men down for good. - [Frank] Probably nobody even there. - Shut up! All right, you two, outta here. Get them. If you want this auction to continue, you're gonna have to pipe down. I can take all this fresh meat up to the North End gang. Now come on, 125. - [Bidder] 125. - All right, 125, thank you, sir. Now let's go with 135. Can anybody go 135? 135 going. Come on, 135. - [Bidder] 135. - All right, 135, now that's real good. I knew this was a lively group (laughs). - It's the hoods, all right. I saw Norm. Wraith must be close. - Oh shit. - Let's go. Remember our priorities. One, don't get put down. Two, release the hostages. And three, if you can, capture the leaders. - Let's kick ass. (guns clicking) - All right, all right. Come on, come on. 145 going once, 145 going twice. Sold to the man in the back there for 145. All right, buddy, now you make arrangements with our accountant, all right? And remember, she's guaranteed for five years or 50,000 miles of bedspring boogie (laughs). Now get her outta here (laughs). Give her to that lucky man in the back, yes, sir. Now this next one is a fresh catch. Get up there. This next one's a fresh catch. Now you know what that means, gentlemen. That means that you can train her any way you want. (Norm laughing) She's young. She's healthy. And she's alive (laughs). Come on, people, this is some of Mr. Wraith's prime stock here. Come on, 120. Come on, let's hear 120. Let's do it, all right? 120. Let's make the bids, people. We're giving you all the free booze you can drink, and then clean water. Come on. Let's hear some bidding! - [Bidder] 110! - I can't let this go for no 110. Come on, let me tell you that this beef it's been tested and approved by Mr. Wraith himself. And, well, she's none the worse for it, except for a little wear and tear. But just think of her as road-tested, lubed and oiled, with a padded upholstery. So let me hear your bids. All right, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna throw in a five-gallon can of gas. Just think, people, five whole gallons. Of course most of you don't have cars, and all of us have nowhere to go. But five gallons of gas'll give you a lotta bartering power. I mean, you can't buy another woman with it, but you sure could buy a few hours with one of our regular girls, and still have a few gallons left over for a month's worth of fresh water, made from Mr. Wraith's own distillery. Or maybe a few grams of Mr. Wraith's own white powder supply. So think about it while you're bidding. Now, who'll say 120? Come on, 120! (kick striking) (gun firing) What the hell is this? (Norm groaning) (dramatic music) - That's the butt of my gun. Anybody want the front? Well? Okay, just take it easy. Just put the guns down and get outta here. Nobody's gonna get hurt. - You're dead, cop. - You wanna come up and play? - [Man] Kill him!

(soft dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Control, Control! Come in. Prescott, this is Travis, Prescott! - This damn well better be important, Travis. - [John] I need immediate backup! Three men down, heavy casualties. - What'd you do, lose control, Travis? - Screw you, Prescott. I need help now! - I can't help you. There's been a solar flare. Everything's fouled up. We're sealing off the bunker. - [John] Okay, then, I'm coming in. - Oh no you're not. I got a buncha people down here. You may have been affected. We can't take any chances. - Affected? What do you mean affected? - Control out. - Prescott. (dramatic music) (soft dramatic music) - Wraith! It's not over yet! (soft dramatic music) - No! Let go! (dramatic music) No! (dramatic music) - Get outta the way! - No! - What the hell took you so long? I'm not waiting around here all damn day! (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (engine roaring) (brakes squealing) (soft dramatic music) (dramatic music) (gun firing rapidly) (dramatic music) (gun firing twice) - He was running away. You shot him in the back! - Just stomping out roaches. - Every time I'm near you, everybody gets killed. - Lady, to me you're just excess baggage. - Wait. What? Who are you? - John Travis, policeman. You like oldies? - How old are you? (John sighing) (upbeat rock and roll music) - Prescott, this is Travis. Come in. - Come in, Travis. Glad to find you alive today. - Yeah, and when I see you, you'll wish I wasn't. - Travis, I've got some information for you. Do you want it or not? - What is it? - There's been another solar flare. People who aren't killed, they're burned and they're going nuts, just nuts. - Yeah, I know that, but I'm bringing a civilian back in. You copy? Over. - You check yourself. Check out the civilian. If he's burned at all, he could be psycho. I mean heavy crazy. - I think we're okay, and we're coming in. - Think isn't good enough. Look, I need somebody up there. - And we need to get in there. - That's a direct order, out. - Out. ♪ Rock and roll is so fine, girl ♪ (engine roaring) - Where are you going? - I got somebody to visit. - What about me? - You watch the Jeep. - What's this for? - In case you get visitors. I'll be right back. (dramatic music) (door sliding) (seller coughing) - How much is this bottle? - [Seller] Uh, $3. - Oh, that much? - How much you got? - $2, we'll have to come back. - Oh yeah? Well, it's okay, let me see that bottle. That looks pretty old to me. That must be half price. - Oh really? Thank you. Do you have anything else half price? - Hm, those beans over there. - Good, I'll take these. - Hurry up, will you? I don't have all day. - Thank you very much. You come back when you can. - When we find some more money, we'll be back. - What kinda guns you got? - I'm sorry, I don't deal in guns. - Everybody knows you got a hidden supply of guns somewhere. - That was in the past. I don't have any guns now. - Three days ago, you sold some guns to a friend of mine. Three days. - No, that wasn't me who sold him those guns. - Liar. Don't lie to me, I'll take you out. Now show me the goddam guns. What are you looking at? You stay outta this, or I'll take care of you too. - You got a big mouth for having a pea brain. (attacker grunting) (door sliding) (attacker groaning) (seller coughing) - Thanks a lot Mister, but I coulda taken care of that myself. You know, that kinda thing goes on around here all the time. - A place like this needs more security. - What's the difference? This town's on its last legs. In a couple of months the gangs are gonna take over anyway. - Maybe. - I wanna make a deal with you. - I'm listening. - You have a car? - Got a Jeep. - Terrific. How would you like to carry a load of supplies out of here and into the mountains? - Not planning on any trips. - I've been looking for someone like you, somebody that can handle themselves. Somebody that's not crazy. It would be an opportunity for you to get outta here. I want you to take my daughter and find a family that'll be good to here, where it'll be safe. - Good families are hard to find now, even in the mountains. - I just want you to get her outta here. - I'm no babysitter. - Well that's good, because I'm no baby. - It could be a good deal for both of you, all the way around. - Dad, he's obviously not interested. And anyway, I think he's a poor choice. - [Man] Let's go. - See what you get, Mister? You see what you get? - You know, you're dumber than I thought you were. - Yeah? (gun firing) - Dad! (dramatic music) - See what you get. (weapon firing) - [Man] Let's get him!

We always need more women. - As what, whores? - They'll find some job for you. - Yeah, I'll bet. - All right, so what now? - Well, we get six more guys and we could have a baseball team. - Travis, I'm serious. - We'll get to sleep here tonight. Tomorrow, we'll try and go shopping again. (soft music) - Well I'm sleeping right here, and if anybody comes near me, they'll wish they hadn't.

Look, food's getting scarce, and the gangs are getting stronger by the minute. So why don't you just get on your microphone, tell them to open the door, and let us in!

Besides, with Wraith and his crazies up here, it's no picnic. - Any idea of where they're holed up? - No, but I'm still looking. - Well look harder and terminate him. - You can count on that.

Maybe we're all policeman. - That's either my hat or one just like it. - Yeah, sure. I know who this guy is, man. You got a bit of a rep out on the street, yeah.

(soft music) (wind whistling) - [Zoe] This is a hospital? - [Lena] Give it a rest. (wind whistling) - [John] Hey, Latimer, you here? - Oh yeah, I'm still here. Travis, well (chuckles). Well well well. Am I happy to see that you're still alive. - How you doing? - Pretty good. How are the rest of the boys? - They're all gone. - Ah. - Got a girl here, needs some help. - Yeah, I can see that she is shook up a little bit. How you feeling? - I'm hot. I don't feel good. (soft music) - She does have a fever, doesn't she, and she is cut up. Well it's a good thing I've still got some penicillin left. I've got it stashed away where the gang and the crazies can't find it. Ah, well. The gangs and the solar flares have taken a lot of good people. I've lost my whole staff. I don't know if I can stay open much longer. And I do what I can to help the people Mainly I set bones, clean cuts, sew them up if necessary. - How'd you manage to stay alive? - I stay alive by hiding in the room where I keep the drugs. I stay there at night. I was inside when the solar flare went off. I saw it through the window. - You saw it? - Yeah, I'm all right. I was in the center of the room. No problem there with me. - Don't they still search this place? - No, they figure they got all of the drugs here some years ago. All they look for now is women and fuel and food. - I can remember my father always thought the Army would stop the gangs. - The military was all over the world but not here. All they can protect now is Washington and New York. (soft music) I guess life is somewhat normal there now. - Oh, what is normal anymore? - Well it certainly isn't here, that's for sure. You know, if it was safe to travel, I'd try to make it to Washington. - You'd never make it. (soft music) - Take care of her, Doc. I'll be right back. (soft music) (upbeat dramatic music) - Hey, kid!

Why do we continue to wait for him? This place is not safe. - No place is safe, babe. You remember? Besides, where do you wanna go? What do you wanna do? I'm sorry. I think he'll be back. - [Zoe] Well of course you do. Where do you get this blind faith that you have, Lena? I don't understand it. You know, he's no Boy Scout. (Lena scoffing) Anyway, I think we'd be much better off on our own. We don't need him. - No, but we owe him. Look, why don't you just take a couple of deep breaths and just sit down here and just relax for a change, Zoe, just relax? - Oh just relax? - Yes, just calm down. - Guys, cut it out. - We're gonna die here anyways. - Oh we're gonna die? That's swell. You know, with an attitude like that, we will die. - That's right, Kid. You gotta be tough. - Well, then we'll be tough. - Excuse me. I don't feel very well. I'm gonna lie down. (soft dramatic music) (door slamming) - Mr. Wraith, I got Travis. - Excellent. - He's alive. There were two women with him. - Oh, that's even better. Were they healthy looking? - Oh yeah, they'll make fresh young whores. - I wanna see them. - I, uh, I couldn't get them. - What? Fool. - Mr. Wraith, Mr. Wraith, I'll get them. I'll get them, I promise. - [Wraith] Where's Travis? - Outside. - [Wraith] Bring him in! - Bring him in here!

Although I could let you live if you give me the women that were with you. - You must be crazy. - Make it easy on yourself, Travis. I'll find them anyway. And when I do, you'll find yourself on a corpse pile along with your three cop buddies. - You can go to hell. (punch striking) - Let's go. We have business. (soft dramatic music) - All right, I've had enough of this. Let's just go. Come on, let's go. - Yes, it's about time that you felt that way. - Where to go? The ballpark is safe, I guess. - Fine. What about scavengers? What if we run into them? - Just do what Travis taught us to do and shoot. - Right on. - Look, look, look what's happening to me! The solar flares have affected my body, and it's spreading so fast, why? Why? Wrong chromosomes, the blood type. I don't know, but I'm slowly losing control! I don't wanna become like one of them. Get out, get out! Get out! Please, don't let me become like one of them, please. (Latimer groaning) (soft dramatic music) (engine starting) (soft dramatic music) - John Travis, the living legend.

Look, I really don't think this is gonna work. You know, I think we should split up. I mean, I think we should just watch out for our-- - No, we're not gonna split up, we're gonna stick together and we're gonna wait here for Travis, okay? - Travis is dead! - Travis is not dead. (wind howling) (soft dramatic music) - [John] Lena? Zoe? (soft dramatic music) Latimer, my God. - I tried killing myself, but I just couldn't do it. - I thought you said the solar flare didn't hit you. - It got me on the hand. I thought I'd be all right, but it just passed right through my whole body. I took a drug to kill myself, but that didn't help either. - Where are the girls? - I don't know, I don't know. I chased them away. The pain is so excruciating. You've got to help me end it all. - No, don't ask me to do that. I've already lost three friends. - Please, Travis, you've got to. You've got to end it for me. Do it, Travis. I'm gonna kill you. - I can't. - I'm gonna count to three. - No. - Please, one-- - I can't. - Two.

By the time I got back, you three had already gone. - Well did you see Dr. Latimer? - Yeah, I saw him. - Was he all right? - Let's say he has no more problems. Where's the gun? - It's right here. - All right. How's the girl? - [Lena] She seems better, but we're almost outta penicillin. - Just keep giving it to her. Tomorrow, I'll take her to the bunker. They're gonna have to let us in. - [Lena] Okay. - You two get some sleep. I'm gonna go out and keep watch. (footsteps fading) (soft suspenseful music) - [Announcer] And this is it, folks.

It's purified. - Thanks. - Kinda. - I can remember when there was a lotta water. Everybody had it. - You know, I've heard there's still some unpolluted lakes up in the mountains there in Montana. - Yeah? I heard that too. - Wanna go there right now? - Sure, it's only 2,000 miles away. We'd be back in the morning. - Yeah. - Ah. Remember swimming pools? Na, you're too young, huh? - You mean you swim? - I did when I was 10 years old, a long time ago. I don't even know if I remember how anymore. - Boy, wouldn't that be great? Imagine that, being neck-deep in fresh water. - Yeah, I remember a swimming pool we had back home. It must had a diving board 30 feet high. And I always wanted to dive off of it, but I was always scared. - There's nothing wrong with being scared. You were only 10 years old? Did you ever do it? - No, by the time I got brave enough, there was a water shortage and no more water for the pool. - You know, I can't imagine you being scared of anything. - You better go in and go to sleep. - Okay.
