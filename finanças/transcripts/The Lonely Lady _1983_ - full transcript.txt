Once again, let me call on our distinguished guest, the film director, Mr. guy Jackson, to present our own modest award to the year's most promising English major, for her outstanding accomplishments in creative writing. Jerilee Randall. You won, jerilee, you won! You did it! You did it! Congratulations, jerilee. Thank you... Thank you. It means a great deal to me to know that the faculty recognizes my work. When I sit at home and write my stories, well, sometimes it seems as if I'm talking to myself. I always try to make at least one of my characters honest and open and worried about some important issue. The kind of thing that bothers us all but we don't usually talk about it because we're afraid that if we talk about it... Thank you, thank you. And keep up the good work, jerilee. - Where? - At Kim's. Did you see that dreadful hat his mother was wearing? Oh, come on, mom. Can I go? Well, all right, but not too late.

No, no, no, no... no! - Yes! - No, no, no... - Yes! - Oh, stop it! Yes! Joe! I'll leave you alone now. I've sedated her. Let her sleep as long as she can. She was supposed to be with Bernie. - Thanks for coming. - She should be fine. But I'm worried about her state of mind. - Do you wanna see her again? - Yes, in a few days. Just to make sure her bruises are healed. - Have you called the police? - The police? - What's the point of that? - Veronica, young men can't get away with that! Whoever they are! Yes, but it's whoever they are that counts! These are Beverly hills' people. I can't afford the lawyers to fight them. - Your daughter's been assaulted! - But not raped. Anyway it's her word against theirs. You don't think they're going to let their precious sons - go to jail, do you? - No, I guess not. So let's just leave it alone, shall we? - I wish you'd think about it. - No. She wouldn't want the neighbors pointing at her and whispering about her behind her back any more than I do. Alright, alright. Bring her over to my office in a couple of days. Good night. Good night. Oh, I can't believe you're here. Jerilee! - Jerilee, you have a visitor. Who is it? I hope I'm not disturbing you? Mr. Thornton? You've probably been wondering about this? - Thank you. - Awards are precious things. I should've brought it sooner. - How are you? - I'm... I've told Mr. Thornton that you're much better. My son, Walt, has gone to England. His mother lives there. You know what, it really wasn't Walt that... He'll probably stay there for a while and finish school. I made coffee, but I don't suppose you have the time. Oh, please, stay! I'd love to talk. Avoiding work is one of life's joys. Thank you. Coffee would be fine. Mother's afraid I'll talk writing and bore you. Well, who'd think nothing else mattered? I love talking writing. I know. I've heard you lecture. Oh, dear. Tell me about your award. Well, that really would bore you. Jerilee thinks I fuss too much. But I can't stand clutter. I can see that. Your house is immaculate, Mrs. Randall. Why, thank you. Your husband must really appreciate coming home to it. - I'm a widow. - Oh, I'm sorry. No, thank you. He died when jerilee was young. It was very hard - at times. - I'm sure it must have been. We were talking about Hemingway. Bringing up a child by yourself is not easy. No. You know I saw Hemingway once, at a press conference, when he was dictating to some journalist. He used to get very angry - when they misquoted him. - Why did he talk to them - at all then? - Because he was a public figure. - He had to. - Plus the fact that he hated growing old. Made him very impatient. Some people want everything. "It's better to go out in a Blaze of youth than live with a shattered body." - I recognize that, don't I? - Mm-hm. - It's from a letter. - You wrote it - right after he was wounded. - The brain's not quite addled yet. - I'm glad I came. - So am I. Um, why don't we get together again in a couple of weeks, after I finish the new screenplay? - We could talk some more? - Oh, I'd like that. At least, I could talk some more. You're a very good listener. Maybe I could read some of your work. I'd be very interested. Okay. Ms. Randall, thank you for your hospitality. Oh, it's nothing. Thirty years ago, I saw myself as a modern Byron, hiding in the tree tops. Always well-sparred, made him popular then, roaring at the hills. Pushkin even. "Dying by the sword with an exquisite thought on my lips." "Call to render account to no one. We deserve and suit oneself alone.” we read Pushkin last year. I prefer Thomas Hewitt. He was a wonderful story teller. Did you ever stand and... Queen of spades? - That was Pushkin. He was also a very old movie chap. I know, I love old movies. I almost died when the countess - opened her eyes in the coffin. - Yeah, me too. - Do you still write poetry? - Mm-mm. No. I guess I grew up. I realized my limitations. And that includes jogging. Come on. I can neither run meters nor write them. So life isn't like a fish. - Oh, Walter. You know? That's what impressed me about your stories. The way they flow. One transition to the next. The way the characters are so well-delineated. Especially that boy in Vietnam, when he decides to re-enlist, - I was very moved. - Thank you. I'm curious. Why do you write about something that is so far - removed from your own life? “who wants to read about the San Fernando valley? You know something, you are an extraordinary girl. To write about things, you have to experience them, otherwise you can only guess. That's not good enough. - Readers will catch on to it. - I don't think - I'm ever going to make it. - Oh, I'm sorry, - I'm walking too fast. - I mean as a writer. ♪ Silver and gold of mine ♪ You're doing just fine. ♪ Two hearts and words a promise we made ♪ ♪ For love, a promise for love ♪ ♪ A promise for love... ♪ - He is too old for you. - It doesn't matter. I love him! - What about college? Walter can teach me more about writing than valley state ever could. Writing! I was hoping you'd do something useful with your life! Mother, why do you think writing is a game for me? Why? What do you want from me? Do you want me to marry some nice guy from the valley, have two or three kids, and be bored to death? Well, you could find someone else. - What about Bernie? - Mother, I don't love Bernie. - I love Walter. - Oh, how can you love him? I do love him. I enjoy being with him, I admire him, - I want to go to bed with him. - I'm not listening to this. I am not listening to this! To my darling, jerilee. Wonderful! - Thank you, Joan. - So good to see you. - Congratulations. Thank you for coming. Thank you. So tell me, what do I call you now, mother Randall? - Hi, how are you? Veronica. - Mother Veronica? - No, not that! - Oh! - Congratulations. - Joe, who's minding the store? - My wife and my mother-in-law. - Oh, you're in deep trouble! - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. - Nice to see you. - Bye. Oh, look who's here, double trouble. I think she'll have him dead in six months. - Hi. - Let's split. Walter, I can't just leave the party! Mrs. Thornton! As my wife, you will do whatever I say. Mr. Thornton, as your wife, I hope I can do as I please. I'm sorry, Jeri. It's been a very tiring day. The story proofs arrived today. Good. You checked them? No, I just sat and stared. Really, I don't know what to do. All those silly correction marks are supposed to mean? We'll go through them together, tonight. Okay? - After the movie. - Great! I'm glad I kept out of that part. I take even money, George. That it goes three million in the first month. You're out of your mind. With that distribution deal, it can't go wrong. What deal? It was made between the sheets, Walter. - It means nothing. - We're going to kicks. Is it wild? I've never been. - Walter isn't much for dancing. - It's the best. Everybody's there. You have to go if you want to make it. Another agent took me last week. Why don't you come with us? I mean what's the woman got, huh? She can't write, - she's unoriginal... - Come on, - she's only one of the best. - Hey, she was a client of mine one time. I couldn't give her away. - What did you think, darling? Well... Here's this popcorn, ask her. Wow! Dialogue was pretty good. Very stylish. - Women can't write dialogue. - Oh, boy! What about Gertrude Stein? Dorothy Parker? Eggheads, sweetheart. They don't count. George, don't be ridiculous! I don't think you can dismiss people just because they're women. Hey, honey, with a figure like yours, you don't have to think. Hey, don't look so glum. Maybe next time - you'll be born ugly, huh? - If I was ugly, I'd kill myself. What do you mean, if? Come on, sweetheart. Let's have an early night, huh? - Are you coming to kicks? - Oh, no, we've got things to do. Sure. Talk to you later. - Good night. - Ooh! - Where's his wife? - Home I guess. That's lousy. Jerilee Randall's first book heads best sellers. Thank you very much. It's taken long enough. More than a year since I wrote it. If they like you, honey? Terrific. If not, then dump them. Listen. "Rape and violence handled with a sensitivity - beyond her years." - Oh! Not bad. "Sensitive and perceptive stories which vividly demonstrate the inadequacy of liberal values in the face of evil." What does that mean, Walter? It means your stories vividly demonstrate the inadequacy of liberal values in the face of evil. Well, thank you! Walter, why don't we go out tonight and celebrate? - My treat. - Walter, how are you? Good. Nice to see you. - The usual table? - Hi, Thornton. Hiya, George. How are you doing? Listen, are you free for lunch one day next week? - Sure. - Could I have - my girl call you? - Mm-hm. - Walter! Hey! - It's great to see you! - Darling, how are you? - Fine. - Hi, how you doing? - Very well, thank you. - I saw guy the other day, guy Jackson? Isn't he gonna be directing - your next film? - Yes, that's right. I worked with guy a couple of centuries ago. He probably won't even remember me. But do me a favor. If you get a chance, could you just mention - you saw me? - Of course, I will. - I'll see you at the table. - Okay. - When do you start shooting? - Uh, not before next spring. Excuse me. I'll speak to you later. Oh, Walter, who's doing the casting? Guy Jackson and I always had this argument... Walter. Hmm? Who would want to be an actress? In this business, you can't afford self-respect. Sh... - Oh yeah... - Gently... gently... Gently... gently... - Walter. - Hmm... How do you start a screenplay? Page one, scene one, and you take it from there. - Ow! I'm serious. Do you think I can do it, Walter? You could but I couldn't take the competition. - Come on! - Well, we start shooting in a month. Maybe you could help. - Doing what? - Typing rewrites, watching. Guy's a pretty good director. You'll learn a lot. That's why I love you. Leave the background, clear for the path! John, you got that wagon out in the... John! Any of you guys seen John? I think you better rewrite the entire scene... Just wait. Wait a minute. Too much of it. It's impossible. I don't feel comfortable... Will you trust Walter? The ol' magic - will happen. It always does. - Nothing but words... Actually, there are a pile of rewrites that you have - to type. - So soon? So soon? Well, with Adolph as a producer, it's lucky you don't really have to type the whole script again. What's with Adolph? He wants a Cecile be the male production on a b movie budget. Don't tell me about her. She's plastic from the waist up... And down. So they say. Well, he thinks that the script has Oscar feeling, that is if it is rewritten enough. - Bud. Hmm. This is jerilee. She's Mr. Thornton's assistant. - Sure. - I hope you can spell, darling. D-a-r-l-i-n-g? Oh, they've sent a professor this time. Mrs. Thornton, actually. - Now these are the rewrites. Uh-huh. Now, if you discover what Oscar feeling is while you're typing them, I'll try and direct it into the movie. - Okay. What's Walter doing? - Playing nursemaid with Adolph. Our leading lady is having line problems. She doesn't waste time. - Have fun! - You too! You know, it is a pig of a speech. Which one is it? - The burial scene. Why don't you rewrite it, sweetheart? Ashes to ashes, dust to dust and let's get the hell out. Walter would love that! - Have they shot the burial yet? - No. They're thinking and lunching. Then they're gonna shoot... her. Okay, okay, I'll do my best. Hot and I'm very tired and the whole of the scene - is wrong. - Tony, this is a very quiet scene that's coming up and I really don't want - any photographs taken. - I'll be right back. Okay, no quick pictures. Hi! Jerilee? George Ballantine. I'm here doing a couple of days for guy. They wanted me for a soap, but I couldn't - turn down a Thornton. - It's a good story. - Yeah. He's the best. Excuse me, - but I've got to talk to him. - Maybe we could have - a drink sometime, huh? - Maybe. I'll check with Walter. - Who's that? - I don't exactly remember - his name, he's a day player. - How was the trailer, honey? - It's fine. - Hold on to that. - I'll look at it later. We're stuck on the burial. I know, bud said... I did some work on it. You what? Did you know about this? I'm sorry. I thought I could help. Stick to the job you're hired for, jerilee. - That's all the help I need. - Oh, Walter, take it easy. Walter, I know her love scene says a lot. - There's a lot to be said. - Please, review this. - I have. - This time read it. The woman's burying her child, for god's sake. Her whole life has been filled with pain and hardship. And now the only thing she loves in life is dead. It makes no sense. She has to protest, for god's sake! Right. So, she looks at the preacher and asks, "why?" One word, that's all you need. A poet might do it one word, jerilee. But I, a simple screenwriter, writing for a simple audience. It's what you're always telling me. Make the words work, cut, - condense, get a clear line. - I've been in this game for a long time, jerilee. I know every trick. - It's no good. - Hey, Walter. Hey, where ya been? Ah, look, have we got something, yet? Hm? Walter, you got my rewrite? - Forget it. - Ah, what the hell! Why? Why? Cut! - Cut the laps. - Check the gate. Hmm, I'm glad that's over. Done, perfect! Wonderful, Molly. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Walter. It is so beautiful now, Walter. It's right. Thank you. Terrific, Molly. Terrific. Just the way I wanted it to be. Alright, you happy now? - Euphoric, yes! Come on. Really? Oh, it's exultant, very, very. It's not far? - No. Excuse me. No problem. Yes, I wouldn't want to give... - Hello. - Hey! - Oh, Laura! Honey, all of you were fantastic. Thank you, darling. Aren't we doing well? We have some wonderful reviews. Didn't I tell you? When that thing opens in Europe, they're gonna be crazy about you. And all the critics picked up on the grave site scene. And so they should. It made the movie. Hmm... remember all that trouble we had? Well, I gotta run. Bobby's waiting for me. I'll see you later. Bye. Good bye to him. Well, it was the old trick, make the words work, cut, condense... I've been at it so many years, I do it in my sleep now. You've been at it so long now Walter, you're beginning to believe your own lectures. Why don't you follow your own advice sometimes? George! - Good to see you. - Ah, Vincent. How are you? You know Mrs. Thornton? Vincent Dacosta. Good to meet you, Mrs. Thornton. Jerilee Randall, Mr. Dacosta. I'm a writer too. I hear that you're coming into movies, Vincent. Hey, we're shopping around, George, what more can I tell you? Keep taking variety, maybe you'll read someone. I don't wanna keep ya. I can see you doing business. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Schmuk. - The hustler who runs kicks? Hustler's too good for him. - Could we have another bottle? - Hey, you sprung a leak, sweetheart? You can call her gherkins, - she's getting pickled. Why not? It's cheaper than self-respect. - What's going on? - My wife has a memory - for the easy phrase. - You said, "in this business, - you cannot... - I know what I said! We were in a restaurant a while back. An actress asked me for a job. I promised to pass along a message, and I couldn't even remember her name. Self-respect isn't even a luxury for a person like that. It's a monster. Had she caught one brief glimpse of herself, grabbing desperately at straws, she'd give up the business. Maybe she should. I've caught so many glimpses of myself through you, jerilee, I've no respect for me at all. Hey, come on. That's been there for years. I know that now. But ever since I first heard that actors, directors, and little typists sitting in makeup trailers were all ready to set about improving my words... And I did nothing about it. Excuse me. Walter! Walter? Walter, come to bed. Haven't you had enough wine? Go sleep it off... You come with me... I'm trying to say sorry. With a head full of drink! - We don't have to make love. - Thank you. We could talk. We need to talk. Why didn't you go off with Dacosta? He would have enjoyed it. Or is this more your kick? Get in here! I wasn't expecting you. Aladdin call... genie come. Well, I hope you don't mind cups because I haven't got any glasses in this joint. So, this is it? Great line, guy, remind me to use it sometime. Who pays the rent? Walter? Walter? Why should Walter? I'm the one that walked out. - How are you making it? - Small royalties. - I'm fine. - You've written two books. - And next, a screenplay. For whom? Me. Two people right after Vietnam, who love each other desperately. But they just, they can't make it because they're totally different. - Can I help you? - Yeah, can you open this? Now, don't settle down, we're going out. Come on, guy. I can't go out like this. Are you kidding? You know, I'm making more in a month right now than I did one time in a whole year... Jerilee Randall. Gary James. - We've met, haven't we? - Gary was my aegeon - on Walter's movie. - That's right. Uh, would you like a drink? I dunno what's left but, um, - I can see what I have to do. - You know we're not - that late. - You're very late. He's just like you, always arguing. Is that Ballantine there? He had a small part in... - I remember. - I didn't think much of him then. Now, he's everywhere. Come on, let's get something to eat. Your stories really got to me, by the way. Mmm-hmm?

Just gimme a call and I'll come by, okay? Just call me. Understand? I told you I'm her mother. She should be down here. Sorry. - Look, I got a message - to pick up my daughter. We have no Mrs. Thornton. She could be calling herself Randall, maybe. I'd just gotten to sleep when the phone rang. - Jerilee Randall? - Yes, that's her. Although why is she not calling herself by her married name, I'll never know. Has she been very sick? If you'd like to sit down, I'll tell her you're here. - Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Get Ms. Randall's things ready. You should have called me yourself. - Who was this man? - Please, mother, - just get me to the apartment. - I'm taking you home. You've been neglecting yourself. You need some looking after. Mother, I've had an abortion. Oh... I don't know why you ever left Walter. Mother, I've tried to work at home, but I can't concentrate. I've gotta get back to the apartment. Look, you can have your own spot. Come on, mom. Let's not spoil our day together. - Nice to see you again, Mrs... - Nice to see you. Come on. Hi... Maggie. This is jerilee Thornton. Jerilee, this is my wife, Margaret. - Hello. - This is my mother, - Veronica Randall. - Good day, how are you? Hello. Oh, I know your face very well. - Thank you. - George, - we mustn't be late, huh? - Yes, it's nice to meet you. - Enjoy your meal. - Jerilee, what's his name? - Come on, mom. - I've seen him so often. Didn't she write a couple of books? - Yes. Doesn't look like a writer. Today's mother's birthday and we're breaking the bank. Oh, please, you don't have to tell everybody. Hence, the beautiful flowers. Nick, come and meet - jerilee and Mrs. Randall. - Hello, how are you? - Fine. Waiter, a bottle of... - Congratulations on the... - Thank you.

Drop by the club any time. - Hello? - Gary? - Yeah. - Hi, it's - jerilee Randall. How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? - Great.

That's the way they see me. - I'm cutting into their action. - Waiter... waiter. They try to keep you out. It's for a different reason. You're young and pretty. They can't believe a dumb blonde could write a movie. Once that I own a property, I can raise funds. Until I do, I can't. The problem is, until Nick and I get this thing set up, there's no budget for buying in. Do you have an agent? Well, only for my short stories. It's catch 22. I can't sell my script without an agent and I can't get an agent until I've sold a script. I'm very excited about this screenplay. I think you better read it first. - Tonight. - Listen, maybe I better find - someone else. - Is it bread? I'm broke. Bust. - Okay, I tell you what I do. If I like it, and it's got the right kinda hook for us, trust me, it may take six months, even a year, but at the end, we'll have a deal. - You don't like it? It sounds great. It's just that...

Gino Paoluzzi and Carla Maria Peroni. - Hello. - Ah, hello. Janie, two brandies and another round for my guests. Come, Vincent, sit down, you're making me nervous. You must be excited to do picture in California. Well, if there's anything that you wanna know about the script... I'm afraid Gino's English is not so good. Now, tell me more about yourself. Well, I really feel that in this screenplay, I've captured - a feeling of... Excuse me. But I must tell you. Your eyes are most beautiful. Thank you. - Carla Peroni, I... - No, no, no - I didn't get your autograph. - No, no, that's okay. Oh! Sorry, Vincent, but this is never going to work out. Let's go back to the hotel. It will be easier there, huh? - You understand? - Of course. I'm so sorry, Mr. Carlton. - I'll meet you back here. - You're not coming? You crazy, look at this crowd. How can I? - What am I gonna say? - Just be nice to them. And we'll have them in our hands. Coming, Carla? - Thank you. - Grazie. What do you think of the script? - Here's to us darling. I can't wait to work with you in California. Your eyes are most beautiful. Your script is beautiful. Everything is beautiful. I know it will be very good. Can you find your way from here? You don't speak English. Hey, what about my script? What script? - Oh, hey... - Hey, come on. Take a hit, right. - Hey, doll, we're naked. My script! Close your eyes, beautiful. - You! - You! - Or is this more your kick? Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! A neighbor brought her in, Mrs. Randall. She was suffering from paranoia and hallucinations. There's never been anything like that on my side of the family. The condition was drug induced at the time. Tranquilizers, cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol. Would you know about her problems? - She's always been difficult. - Any specifics? - She's acutely depressed. - Her father died soon after she was born. I've always tried to make a happy home for her. More recently? Anything humiliating, damaging? You'd have to talk to her husband. He'd know more about that than I'd do. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... - I was like... - Well, who do you think is paying for all this? I certainly can't afford it. - I'll call him. - Thank you. I think we're here now. If you'd like to step in and see your daughter? - Will she talk to me? - Go ahead. Try. Jerilee? May I sit down? Honey? What have you done to yourself? Everything is gonna be alright. Don't worry. Everything is gonna be alright. No one is going to hurt you. No one is going to hurt you. Where are you, jerilee? Where have you gone? I mean, you've been hurt before. We all have. That's life. Hurting and being hurt. You need people. You're not a loser. Now come out and win, jerilee. Please, jerilee. Don't give up. I don't wanna lose you. I love you. I haven't had my mid-day pills yet. That's right, jerilee. We're cutting down on them now. Oh. I can't wait to start working again. You're looking great. Am I? It's okay. Don't be impatient. It's coming good. - Oh, excuse me. - No, no, come in, Mr. Jackson. That looks like pretty good medication. - Hi. - Hi. - How's it going? - Slowly. It's like looking into a mirror. Maybe, you're too close to it. Maybe, it's too soon. No, I don't mind it. As a matter of fact, I think it's good for me. At least I'm writing about something I know for a change. But what's even more surprising, guy, I don't mind looking into that mirror. - I wanna take it to my agent. Joanna? - That's not my scene, guy. - No, no, no. She was all wrong. Someone to take you through the door. - What if he doesn't like it? - He will. Castel's a good producer, jerilee. And he's ready for a woman writer. He should be ready for good script. Oh, you can't have it both ways. You're always griping because no one sees you. There's two things we can do. One: Sell him a story and he'll put someone else to work on it. Look, we both know this is my story. This isn't that lousy first screen play. This is me. It's my story. It's my child. It's a part of me. How can you ask me to give it away? Okay. So, the second thing is to put together a package that Castel can't refuse, whoever's writing it. - Blonde or brunette. - Go on. Guy directing, 75,000 upfront for you. Ten points. And George Ballantine. - Sorry, it's no go. - Jerilee, in my book, this is probably the best chance you got. - Maybe the only chance. - I don't want Ballantine. Kiddo, in this business, there's only one creed. Make the movie. Make the movie. Nothing more nothing less. What goes on backstage, so what? Who cares? It's the movie that matters. Now, that's just as true for you as for anyone else. Maybe more so because you're a woman. So, if you can't get it together, don't even try. Because you'll just become another bum and you won't be able to cut it in this town. Hey, look kid. You're not in the movies yet, so wise up. You've already had one abortion, sweetheart. Don't make it two. - Same father! - So what? That's between you and him. What matters is the child. This child. Your only one now, jerilee. Let it live. I'm telling you as a businessman it's got to. Honey, it deserves to. Okay. What do I do? Ha! I'll have you meet with tom Castel. And I'll lend you my car. I hadn't expected someone quite as young. Or as pretty. - Thank you. - Well, what would you like? - White wine? - Fine, thanks. Okay. You wrote quite a picture, jerilee. I think we can do something with it. Come on through. We're out here. I don't know too much about you. Weren't you married to Walter Thornton? - For a while. - I guess, he's some teacher. Certainly given you style. - Joanne, here's jerilee. - Hi. Hi. Joanne is a great fan of your script. I loved it from page one. You got real class, jerilee. - Well, thank you. - Her brother, is the vice president of the studio. She gets to read an awful lot of junk. Won't you come and join me, jerilee? It's wonderfully relaxing. Tom, you must have some calls to make. Right. It's the show of the year. Nothing else now. It's been good talking to you. Well, my pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Guy Jackson, ladies and gentlemen. Guy Jackson, the director of a wonderful film, the hold out. And, uh, speaking of the hold out, I see coming this way the producer of the film, Mr. tom Castel... Who's the blonde? - On her own? - Yeah, yeah, walking up there. Can't be anybody if she doesn't have an escort. Stacey Ryan and John Casey. That is a beautiful dress, Stacey. Hollywood has a reputation for claiming to treat writers as equally important. But thinking of them, - as equally unimportant. Don't let the twentieth century fox you, ladies and gentlemen. The writer's status is universal. In accordance to us, Paramount. Nominations for best original screenplay, are... - Walter Thornton, getting rich. Jeremy Alan, candles burning free. Frank Landers, ride of the wild. - Jerilee Randall, the hold out. Thank you, Stacey. The winner is... Jerilee Randall, the hold out. Congratulations. Ladies and gentlemen, I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have received this award. It's a wonderful compensation for having caught so many unhappy glimpses of myself while working toward it. Tradition has it that I should thank all those who had a part in helping to make the film. And it would be remiss of me to ignore their various contributions. Especially those of our director, Mr. guy Jackson... Our producer, Mr. tom Castel, and his wife, Joanne... And our leading man, Mr. George Ballantine. Not all of them gave as much as they took. But that's no surprise. Because in this business, the price of success is very high. Especially for a woman. I don't suppose I'm the only one who's had to fuck her way to the top? Many of my so-called friends, agents, producers, actors, offered to help my career along the way, but always for a price. And I did nothing to stop them. And Walter dear, I never did learn the meaning of self-respect. I'm sorry.
