Why are you leaving, Nanise? Is it because of me? - No. It's because your mother is evil. - That's not true. Not true. Are you still here? Goodbye, Nanise. Shouldn't you have left for school by now? Stop it. I told you it's late. Desideria, congratulations on your birthday. Mamma, I don't think anybody is going to come. In your opinion, why do you think nobody came? Maybe you made a mistake on the invitation. Maybe they'll come tomorrow. Nobody came... and it's my fault. I eat all the time... and it's my fault. My mother doesn't smile... it's my fault. I constantly tell lies... and it's my fault. Mother is getting old... and it's my fault. Mother is unhappy and it's my fault. Congratulations, Desideria. Happy birthday. Thank you, Titti. You love me, don't you? - Everybody loves you. - Even my mother? Certainly. What kind of question is that? Blow the candles out. - Yes, Titti. But I'd rather be alone. - Certainly, my dear. That's fine. Congratulations. Nobody, I swear, nobody came. But no, Sam... It wasn't a misunderstanding. Nobody thought it was "tomorrow". Everyone knew it was tonight. He died and everything became empty. Why? No, Sam. It's not worth it. I'd like to have a normal life. But, instead, I'm alone. Mother, I feel bad about last night. I've thought about it... and I've made a decision. No. I thought about it all night... I have an idea I want to tell, then you can decide for yourself. It's not important. Let's talk about happier things. You liked Chantel... she was simple and kinda cute. She was blonde... but not silly like the other one. Desideria? No, I decided she will go to college. She's the Monster of Luna Park. Look at yourself. Look. Look at yourself. Why Rome? Of course it's a lively city. And probably better than Paris... much better than London. Isn't that true, Sam? - No thank you. - Chantel, you'll like it here. Don't you drink coffee? - No thank you, madam. Don't call me "madam". Call me Viola. And Mr Tibello... you can call him Sam. We're going to the movies. Do you want to come? - That's sounds good. - Mother, can I go to the cinema too? Honey, the film is "restricted". You can go some other time. Mother... I'm getting the keys for the refrigerator. Mother is a liar... she didn't go to the movies. Mother is a liar... she didn't go to the movies. Instead of sleeping, you spend your nights standing here with your food, thinking about food, eh? - And you, what are you doing? I'm going to throw you out. I'll put you in that school where they'll cut your hands off if they see you eating food late at night. No, Mom. I'm begging! Not that college! Donâ€™t call me "mother". You should know I'm not your mother. I adopted you and that was the biggest mistake of my life. Your mother was a whore. She sold you to me. I took you in because I wanted to have a family. Look at yourself! You could never be my daughter. You're so repulsive that you couldn't even become a whore like your mother. The voice come around noon. One day... summer... in the garden of my father... It was so hot... I couldn't tell where the voice was coming from. The first time I heard the voice I was aware of my virginity. But I lost it quickly to the pleasure of the gods. Desideria, are you sleeping? - Can you hear me? - Yes. I was thinking... It would be great to be like Joan of Arc... and hear a voice that told you what to do. What do you hear? Mother, are you going to the movies with Tibello, tonight? My love, I told you Tibello is only my business associate. Now, it's only us. I love you. And you? I always loved you. My love, we have a visitor. Look who's here. How are you? You look different. I hardly recognize you. What happened to you? - I took some pills. I bring greetings from everybody. Even from the professors. Thank you. Oh... how nice. What a beautiful gift. Is it loaded? - Yes. - Can you take a photo of us? - With pleasure. Let me see. This is the first photo of us together. Certainly. It embarrassed you to be in a photo with me. Regina and I would like to be alone. Can you leave us for a bit? Certainly. Yes. You have a lot to talk about I imagine. Can you close the door? Yes. Certainly. You threw her out. Why? - She's not my mother. - What do you mean? She and her husband couldn't have kids, so they bought me. Why did your mother sell you? Because my real mother was a poor slut. And she sold me. I don't believe that. Don't you know whore make a lot of money? - How do you know? - My seamstress told me. If that's the truth, everyone would be a whore, no? Even you. Your mother. Your seamstress. I'll give Viola all the money she spent buying me. I don't feel anything for her anymore. - How will you do that? You said being a whore makes a lot of money. So I'll be a whore like my mother. - I'd like a bath. Will you help me? - Yes. - Can you start the water in the tub? - Yes. Regina, would you introduce me to your seamstress? Yes. There she is. Come on. I am Desideria. You're Diomiria the seamstress. Yes. I am Diomiria. Come. I want to give you a gift. Come. I don't live too far. I can't. I have to be home in an hour. There are many things which can be done in an hour. Come. I have a car. You'll be on time. I'll make many beautiful dresses for you. Many people will turn and look at you. Just to see you. Come on... I know you'd like to be admired. There's nothing wrong. You're just like a Madonna. Full of grace. Come. Sit down. Listen... What kind of gift are you giving me. - Whatever you want. - But what is it? How about a nice dress? See how beautiful... it looks good on you. - No thank you. - Don't you like it? You must tell me how much you'll give me... if I go with the men you bring here. Oh, I see. You'll be giving money to me, my dear. After all, you already have money. You're not here for money. You're here because you want to be. I need to make a phone call. Wait here, all right? Very well. But first tell me how much you'll give me. Tell me how much you'll give me for my virginity. Because it's one thing to make love and another thing to make love with a virgin. Listen to this, my Golden Baby... And she knows more than I do. How much do you want? - At least 500$. It's true... people with money under-estimate its true value. I'll ask him. It's someone who pays very well. I'll give you half. Hello, is it you? Yes, it's me. I have what you want. We don't have much time. Come here immediately. I've got the thing you asked for many times. That's the one. It's that very rare thing... very rare. The thing everybody is looking for... but no one can find. Yes. She's here and ready. All for you. But it will cost a lot of money. It's very special. This isn't something you'll find everyday. No. She came out of the factory about 15 years ago. You can do whatever you'd like to her. Of course you can break it. Is she light or dark? You're a curious man. I told you she just came here. Very well... hold on. What are you doing? I need to see what color you are down there. If you are the right color the price will go up. It's the color you asked for. That's enough. I'm losing my patience. All right, I'll be waiting for you. And today you have to being getting your period. This guy wanted a virgin... and now what will he find? An old menstrual pad. I'm going to tell him you must do it in the dark because you're embarrassed. Come on. Come on. Blood here... blood there. No difference. - And the money? - After. If he finds out you're having a period... there'll be trouble. Help! Help! Open! What about he money? Give me the money. Open, you whore witch! Open up and give me the money. Answer the door. - Good evening. - Come in. - Do you need anything else? - No thank you. We're fine. Do you see? Everyone is looking at you. Eh? Yes, everyone is looking at you. - Get dressed. It's getting late now. - I don't feel like it. We'll have a good time. I have nice friends. You'll see. This guy is very nice. He was a friend of your father. My father? Bullshit! Your husband! Enough of those stories. We have to be friends. Come on. Can you fasten my gown, please? I can't do it. Can you see how my heart is beating? For you... know that? Come on. Get dressed. Leave those dresses alone. Try this one. Look how pretty it is. Come on. - Like it? - All right. See? You've got to start accenting your beauty. I'll teach you. - You're talking like Diomiria. - Like who? Never mind. Just someone I know. Give me the dress. I'll meet you inside. I've got to go to the bathroom. Very good... I'll be in the nightclub. - I'll be waiting. - Yes. - Good evening, madam. - Good evening. Would you page Emilio in the nightclub? Tell him to come here. Very good, miss. Please advice Emilio Trebi to come to the bar for a guest. - And a double whiskey. - Very well. - Good evening, Mr Trebi. - Good evening. The madam... please. - My pleasure. - So you are Emilio Trebi. I am Desideria. Sit down. Give my friend a drink. - What would you like? - Same as the lady. - They're waiting for you. - I'm not going. Another double. - Why aren't you going? - Because my mother is there. And the music is terrible. Mine also... along with my father. And your mother... how is she? She's just a poor woman. She has the patience of a saint. What does all this mean? Your mother is neither poor nor a saint. - What do you mean? - Our mothers are the same. "The same"? Both of them are sluts. Your mother and my mother are dirty bourgeois whores. Want to go dancing? You should go dancing with your mother. Go. She's waiting for you. Another double. So, come on... what about your little mommie? Please, leave me alone. Please. You're nothing but a drunk. Goodbye you jerk! Ignorant. Boring. Conventional. Odd. She pushed me to suicide. She smothered me. She never could be my mother. She'll never be able to change. She treats me like those whores she used to take to bed. To hate her means nothing. I need a plan with the money I'll get. A good plan. She revolts me. She's hideous. Inside her soul. A plan. A revolution. Give it to me! It's mine. I forbid you to keep it. What's wrong with you? Are you going crazy? You're naked. Drunk. And talking to yourself. It's better to be drunk and talking to myself... than to be fucked in the ass by your administrator. Sweetheart, what's happening? - I'm cold. - You're cold? Hug me. Come. Come. - Come. - I'm cold. - Isn't this better? - I'm cold. You know how it ended up last night? My mother came into my room while I was sleeping. A waiter accompanied her to the room. They were both drunk. He put his mouth to my lips while she held me. They wanted me to fuck both of them. But I bit my mother's hand instead. And she started screaming. And the waiter ran away. So then she started beating me very hard. I can't stay here much longer... I must leave very soon. - Where do you have to go? - To Venice... where you live. - How? - Nobody's at your house now, no? To become a man you must experience a woman. I believe you've never been with a woman before. If you take me to Venice, I'll let you take me to bed. You're so full of yourself, but your still just a little girl. No. I'm a woman now. I was deflowered two months ago in a whorehouse. - I don't believe it. - It's true. I'm not afraid of anything. I still don't believe it. And how much money did they give you? 1000. Half for making love and half because I was a virgin. I still don't believe it. If it's true, tell me how far did he get in? - In the beginning, just a little. - That's not enough. I said "in the beginning". Then he gave a push and everything went inside. And he put the money between my legs and he said: "You were very good". "I put the money here because that's how you made it". So this is where you started your revolution, Minuccio. What are you saying? You told me you've been reading Das Kapital. - Stop talking so presumptuously. - I'll stop when I feel like it. And where is your mother's bedroom? I already told you: we can't do it over there. Come on. Please. There. Or not at all. Das Kapital? Big revolutionary? Take a shit on your father's picture. - But why? - If you don't... then nothing. Come on. Get to it. I can't. I just did it on the train. So then spit on him. Come on. Is that enough? Very good, bravo. Could you show me a photograph of your mother? Why? I just want to see her. Come on. Let me see it. I want you to piss on her. Come on. - Whore! - Piss on her or I'll give you nothing. Come on or nothing. Go wash yourself or you're going to stink. My husband was in bad health. He was becoming uglier all the time. Poor man. On the other hand, you're becoming more beautiful. If you continue like this, you'll be prettier than your mom. You're truly a beautiful boss. Boss, my ass. I'm just like you. But I'm the daughter of a whore. Viola told me everything. I want to ask something. Titti, please sit down. Come on. You've been here for many years. Did you ever see my real mother? - I can't answer... - Tell me. Tell me about my mother. Who was she? A mother isn't the one who brings you into the world. She's the one who takes care of you. The one who cures you. - So then you're my real mother? - Don't talk nonsense. I was only kidding. I'm only saying you love me more than Viola. Your mother is a good woman. Good for nothing. Viola, your boss has always taken advantage of you. That's it. If she were here, you couldn't even sit like you're doing now. Oh, it's you. Hello. I didn't recognize you for a moment. I was waiting for you. Please have a seat. - Here's the money. - I don't want it. How much will you give me for this? It's very unique. Where did you get it? It's mine. It's a present from my friend. Want it or not? I don't buy stolen merchandise. So you're calling me a thief? No, but your friend is. You're crazy. Emilio is rich. His house is full of this stuff. How much do you want? 500. Desideria? Desideria? If you'd like, we could go to the movies tonight. I don't like your kind of movies. Listen. Excuse me, can I speak to you for a moment. I must ask you something. What do you want? I want to know something. I must ask you a question. I don't have time. Come here. Sit. Want a cigarette? - No. So then? I want to know how much a whore makes. My mother was one. - How much is enough? - What do you mean? I mean... I eat, I drink and I sleep. - But aren't you rich? - No. So then why do you do this? What else can I do? Waitress? Nurse? Why are you smiling if you have no money? I can't explain it to you now. Bye. Bye. Who are you? What do you want? Why do you meet old and ugly? Do your friends know how you spend your evenings? What's going on? Does your mom know about it? - Stop or I'll scream. - Then scream. Why don't you scream? - I'm going to call the police. - I'm the police, understand? Show me some ID. Desideria Passo. Very good. You're still a minor. Where do you go to school? - The French High School Voltaire. Let's go downtown and call your parents. My father is dead. And my mother is out of the country. When does she come back? At the end of the month. Okay. Then we'll see each other at the end of the month. Good day. I'm Desideria Passo. Please come in. The doctor will be right with you. Desideria? Good day. How's everything? I sold the cross to you because I don't want money from my mother. That money isn't from your mother. It's mine. - What do you want? - Money. If I can help, I'd be glad. How much? 10,000. 10,000. Yes. 10,000. Sit down. Come on. If I had 10,000 laying around, I'd be a rich person. But we could take it from mother's account, no? I know there's more than 400,000 in her account. If we took 10,000, she'd never miss it. Very good. I didn't know you were so good at math. It's my money too. I'm only asking for an advance. I'm curious... what would you do with 10,000? My business. Changing some things. But you've already changed a lot. I mean... you're no longer a little girl.. Yes. If I became a woman it's because of you. Do you remember the time you and Viola were making love and Chantel was there too? The day before, I was a child. The day after, I was a woman. Can you understand what it's like to see a man as he fucks my mother in the ass? Oh, yes, I forgot... so this is how youngsters talk today? - What youngsters? - Your type. Those who dress like bohemians. Those who want to change everything. I want 10,000, nothing more. So this daughter of a millionaire goes to the administrator like it's nothing... and ask for 10,000 like it's nothing. All we have to do is take it from her mother's account. Thanks to the easy procedure... thanks to the ass. Did you think I didn't see you with your ass in the window? Did you think I didn't know you were there? Don't tell me you didn't hear me coming in. I called your name... and you... like a bitch... instead of answering me, you started gyrating at the window. I didn't do that because of you. I was trying to see what was happening on the road. You were only interested in showing your ass to me. - Why are you talking to me like that? - Because you're a whore. The daughter of a whore. "10,000. Please." Just for some changes. I know what you want to do. You want to throw 10,000 to the revolution groupies... to help finance the silly revolution against establishment. Don't say it's not true. The way you dress speaks for the way you act. With a nice ass. All right! But for this money... you need to learn how to earn it. Now, don't fight and don't speak. Or I'll break your neck. Walk to the window and remove your pants. This is what you want now. All right... Push your ass back to me. Look. Yes. Like that. And now, give me the money. Desideria... you're asking me to steal. And I'd prefer lying to stealing. You're a filthy bastard! A jerk off piece of shit. Maybe. But not a thief. You won't see me anymore. You make me sick. I can give you a bit of my money... but not from your mother. I wouldn't touch your miserable money. That's all I can do. Take it or leave it. I have to go. I'm busy. You know the exit. If you want to see me again, telephone me. - You make me sick. - Bye. You make me sick! Desideria. Professor Occhipinti from the French School is here. - Who? - Professor Occhipinti. He's waiting for you in the living room. Very good. Tell him I'll be there right away. Yes. Hello, Desideria. How come you're disguising yourself as a professor? Today I'm not a professor nor a policeman. You're right. You're a jerk. With the hands of a farmer... and bowlegged. You're only a swindler. A ragman in rich clothes. You're a sinister... hopelessly sinister. And now... get out of here. Very well, I'm going. But first let me tell you something. Last night I follow you out of curiosity. Because you seem like a strange kind of girl. Then I went back and talked to that prostitute. I became even more curious than before. That's why I came here. Now I discover you're a racist bureaucrat. You're identical to this house. You're arrogant and stupid like every rich person I know. If you're not a policeman, who are you? I'm a son of a school teacher and a nurse. But poor people don't dress like you. But... Are you saying poor people must always remain poor? So then, tell me what you do because you don't appear poor. - I do what your mother does. - My mother who? That woman told me what your mother does. So then are you claiming to be a prostitute? Yes. - And you're not embarrassed? - No. I can't afford to be embarrassed. What's your name? "A O"? Occhipinti. First name? Aristole. What do you mean... you can do it in so many ways? We are organized in groups. And every group acts in one way or another. So what does your group do? It hasn't been together for long... in Milano. And I'm the representative in Rome. Soon, a rep from Milano will be coming. I'll talk to him and if you want to be part of the revolution... You aren't only interested to piss off your mother. Let's say you introduce me to your group and I become part of it. What kind of action will be involved in? Everything. From demonstrations to bank robbing. - So then, you're bandits. - But specialized. To conduct a revolution, you must be a special type of bandit. For me it's easy. In my town you either become a policeman or a bandit. But for you... it's different. You'll enjoy the feeling of rebelling. You could become instrumental as a bandit. Anyway, for a decision we must wait for the guy from Milano. - And when is he coming? - Soon. Very soon. Who is this? Is this your mother? Viola. She looks very attractive. The best part of her, you can't see it in a photo. - And what is her best part? - Her ass. Listen... Do you want to make love? I can't. I'm a virgin. But... if you want... you can kiss me. You can touch me. - Good evening. - Evening. I'm looking for Mr Occhipinti. - He's on the first floor. Number 7. - Thank you. What are you doing here? - Who let you inside? - The door was open and I came in. I don't like for people to visit me here. Understand? If you want to talk to me, I'll call you tomorrow. Go. But I want to tell you something very important. - I can wait until tomorrow. Go. - No. Please. Today I'm finished. I'm tired. I want to sleep. Go away. - What's wrong with you? I love you like a brother. Even if you are a liar and an egotist. I have no intention of making love with you. Very well. So then? What do you want? Fast. Very well. When you saw the photo of Viola, I got an idea. But we have to act fast because Viola is coming back tomorrow. I have a plan. But, promise me, if you're not interested... then you'll forget everything I'm going to tell you. Okay. I promise. And when Aristole promises something, it's a promise. - Hi Titti. Is everything all right? - Yes. - And Desideria? - She's outside in the garden. Desi! Mama... - But... Desi? - Mama. Mama, you thought I was fat again! Good joke. Good joke. Come here, you little whore. Why don't you call on me anymore? - I have nothing to say to you. Come. Come. Come and see me. Come to my house. We could play some games... and you'd never forget it. I could climb on top of you... You'll like it. Darling. - You make me sick! I'll give you money if you're nice to me. And I'd throw it down the toilet. - You're incredible. - Leave me alone. Are you tired? Remember when we went away to the mountains. You were cold. And you got so close to me I almost suffocate. You were complaining and crying. You were my little girl once again. But you, you were caressing me between my legs. You were scared... I was only trying to protect you. We are mother and daughter. More than ever. And I love you as much as if I had given you birth. Viola, I have to tell you something. Something very important. - I fell in love. - What? I fell in love. But how did this happen so suddenly? You'll see, you'll like him too. We love each other. We care about each other, Viola. Don't call me Viola anymore. From now on you will always be Viola to me. Know why? Because from now on we're going to be like two good friends. We have to tell everything to each other. Share everything. Help each other. My father always told me one thing. Property is everything. He would love for me to return home and administer the estate. But I won't consider it. I wouldn't even think of burying myself in such a small town. No. I have a degree in Science and Economics. Here in Rome I'm already in contract with an important firm. Anyway, I want to establish myself in this city. And your mother? My mother comes from a family of lawyers. She's older than my father. They're together, but it's more like they're apart. She's a very reserved woman... attached to the family. Every morning she goes to Mass. She's a woman with a high self esteem... she's a baroness. To you, Desideria, and to you, Aristole. Listen, Aristole and I would like to know... if we would be good together. And we'd be grateful if you'd give us a hand. I'm honored, but how? You own a lot of apartments and some are empty. I'd like you to lend us one. At the moment, Ari hasn't been able to find a house. For now, he's forced to live in a hotel. Until he finds a house, can you help us? Yes. Certainly. I'll show you one. - Hi. - Hi. - And Desideria? - She couldn't make it. Because one of her friends got hurt and had to go to the... One one her friends? Who? I don't know. Anyway, you can see for yourself and she'll see at another time. Over here is the kitchen. And here are the two bedrooms and two bathrooms. One here. And one on the other side. Over here. It's already furnished but, if you don't like it, I can have the furniture taken away. Over here's the living room. Everything is in order. And so? What do you think. Good. You want something to drink? Whiskey? Do you want whiskey? What's wrong? You don't like the fireplace? As you can see it's not finished yet. If you have any ideas... Wait. Do you like it like this? Come. Kiss me. Kiss me. Hey. - So then? - It went well. Here are the keys. Everything is going very well. It's really the right apartment. What are you writing? - Nothing. I was just writing about you. - About me? - I'm scared. - And why? Because Viola will give you a lot of gifts now. She'll give you money. And you'll tell her everything. You'll become her lover. She'll be proud. This morning when you called and told me to come here... the moment I heard your voice... I was so happy. When I was shaving... I started singing. Alone. Like a jerk. You're a bastard, like me. You're ashamed to be the son of poor people. The only thing you can be is a liar, a vulgar rotten liar. If you want to know more you can read my diary. You're the only friend I have. You're the only person I care about. But I can't hate your mother. Understand? I'd never trade you. Take back your diary, it's private. I don't want to read it. But I need to tell you one thing: what we're doing should never be written about in a diary. Leave it in your head. Then burn it. I was on her back and she couldn't see me. And I started making faces. It's true. I was making faces at her. Then she asked me to do something. She ordered me to do it. Look... At that second I felt like killing her. I swear I wanted to smash her head. But then... suddenly she started crying. She put her head on my shoulder and started crying. And she said to me the only thing she cares about in life. It's for you to love her. At that moment I felt sorry for her. All she talks about is you. Of course. She's in love with me. Now she's tormented because I'm with you and she wants to separate us. - Did you ask if she likes a threesome? - Yes. - And what was her response? - She said she likes it very much. Now you have to make sure she asks me to join you. That's no problem. She said if I'd like to, we can meet each other every day. So then it will be easy to convince her. But let me tell you this: for the last phase of the plan, we must wait for my friend from Milano. - "Friend from Milano". "The director from Milano". "People from Milano". You always tell me these things and I don't know if they exist. - You're a liar. - But... How many times must I tell you those people from Milano exist. And I'm part of their revolutionary program. I can't do anything without their consent. That's why we have to wait. I already told the guy from Milano about or plan. He's coming here for that reason. I couldn't tell him everything by phone. Don't you agree? He's coming tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. Tomorrow. What time? Who are you? What do you want? Put that gun away, shithead. He's not a thief. He's my boyfriend. After all, this apartment is ours. If Viola forgot to tell you, ask her. Now get out. - I didn't know anything. - Oh yeah? Then how come you have the keys for the apartment. I'm your mother's administrator. I control all of her apartments. And so I have all the keys to all the apartments. First, this apartment is ours. It's no longer your business. And take away that bed, it makes me sick. Secondly, give me the keys. Third, throw away that gun; it makes you look ridiculous. My compliments... Mister...? Aristole. Occhipinti Aristole. Come. Finally. I'm scared. Don't be scared. I'll wait for you always. Here I am. I'm here. - I'm scared. - Come. What are you waiting for? I'm scared. Come on. Come. It's beautiful. Come on. Don't be scared. - You'll forgive me? - For what? What's to forgive? Come. Come. Desideria! What's wrong with you? I had a bad dream, mother. - It's only a dream. - Forgive me. - Forgive you? For what? - Please forgive me. Certainly I forgive you. Come inside. My little girl, calm down. Come to the hotel. Alone. Viola. Why didn't you say hi? You seem like somebody else? Is it because of last night? What happened last night will never happen again. Desideria, anyway, I... Now I understand why you're like someone else. Because this dress doesn't fit you very well. You know what you look like in that dress? A cylinder. That dress makes your ass too flat... And your ass is your most beautiful part. That's enough. You don't know what you're saying. Excuse me, but I think the dress is talking to me. And you know what it says?: "I'm a mature woman. I'm a family woman". But your ass says something completely different. It says: "I'm beautiful, young. And I want to be loved." Everyone wants to be loved. But it should come from the heart. Enough of that kind of talk to your mother. We aren't mother and daughter anymore. We agreed that we'd be friends, no? - Enough of this nonsense. - No, I won't stop it. I don't like you treating me like a Puritan, but not Aris. Ah, Aris. So that's what you wanted to talk about? He told you everything. Isn't that right? Very good. If you really want to know... I wanted to take him away from you because there's something you'll never understand about him. He's a commoner, with only a few pennies. He's a drifter. Here's what I wanted you to understand. - Which is? - He's nothing but a zero. Nothing. So you did it for my love. But I'm not jealous of Aris. I'm glad he took the place of Tibello and the others. Know why? Because after I found out you weren't my mother, I had the desire to take the place of Chantel and the rest. But Tibello, I hate him. And now we can go to the apartment on Cassia... where I, you and Aris can be together. Let me take off your underwear. If we remove your panties now, your ass can say anything he wants. All right. I'll tell Aris about it. Tonight. At 6 o'clock. I have to pick up something urgently from Tibello. Can you go? I'm very tired. You want to know about your boyfriend? I already know about him. I don't need an investigator. You think you know but listen to me very well. I'm your administrator so then I feel the obligation... You're only Viola's administrator. That's all. I came here to pick up some papers for Viola. Nothing more. You have to know, for example... Mr Occhipinti is not the son of a baron like your mother said, but rather... the son of a caretaker and... - A nurse. Very well. He told you. Then you probably also know he doesn't have a degree and no diploma either. But maybe you don't know what job he has? Yes. He's a prostitute. - He's also the lover of your mother. - He's not a lover of my mother. He's the lover of that whore Viola. He's also a confidence man for the police. Plus he takes a salary for infiltrating rebel groups. People like you. Here's the whole report. I knew that too. He told me everything on the night we met. Very well... pretend I didn't say anything. But, anyway this is for you. And, the last thing... But we need to go on the other side. Desideria, I must tell you something very important. I want you to become my wife. I'm a Catholic. For me... this moment, in front of this altar... This is not just an antique... it's something sacred to me. I must pray right now. I'm hoping with my prayers you'll better understand me. When I've finished, I want you to tell me Yes or No. Pig. Throw her out. I don't like this woman. I told you we'd see each other at 6. Now go. Pig! And I don't care if you like me. I'm Desideria. He's always telling me that we have to wait for the man from Milano, to listen, to see this man from Milano. Very good. Are you the friend from Milano? Yes or No? So then, are you deaf? Stupid? Or mute? What the fuck are you doing? Stop it. Like before, I told you not to touch her. Get out. I want to question your girlfriend. - That's enough. Leave her alone. - She'll decide what she wants to do. Get out. Very good. Bye. I'll see you at 6. This is how you want to get fucked? You like it this way? Like a whore? Whore! Fuck, you're having your period. You should have told me it was that time. Learn how to fuck. And you, when you fuck, try to learn how to treat a virgin. That was my first time, you damn jerk. Are you trying to fool me? Yeah. The daughter of a rich millionaire is trying to fool you, a man with one pair of slacks. So, are you letting me in the group? - Maybe. I don't know. - But why don't you know? - It's not just up to me. "Maybe". "I don't know". Look, that's my blood... shed for you... and all of us. You, what do you do? You're worried about cleaning it off. I don't know about you yet. You must have patience. Occhipinti told me you're an exuberant girl. Some wheels don't turn correctly in your head. But I don't doubt you think like us. Listen to me. I'll take you to Milano and you can live with me. I'll let you meet the director and then we'll see. - And my plan? - What plan? The one Aris told you about. To make my mother give us the apartment for a threesome. Then to kidnap her, and write a letter to her family - which is me - demanding a big sum of money. And then I go to the administrator and he'll give me the money. I'll give the money to the Group and then I'll go to Milano with you. Yes, he mentioned it. But we can't do it. Why? Because your mother will identify both you and him. Never. I'm sure of it. - Anyway, we can't do it. - But why? Because that apartment on Cassia is not good. Why isn't it any good? It's in the right place. Out of the city. With an exit in the rear. It's not good because it's a bordello. It's again our regulations. The house were a crime is committed can't be a bordello. That house is a whorehouse for your mother. - My mother. Mother. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What is it? Nothing. I was thinking we can't do the kidnapping... ...because Aris is a liar. He's a traitor. He's a spy working with the police. Hey. Are you crazy? Repeat what you said about Occhipinti. He's a traitor. A spy. You're saying something very serious. Be careful what you're saying. Do you have proof? If I give you proof, what will you do to him? What do you care? I care because he's like a brother to me. We won't do anything. We'll remove him from the group and that's all. Do you have proof? Look in my purse. We have to meet at 6. But I don't want to see him. I don't want to go home. I want to go with you. I want to go to Milano. You'll do whatever I tell you. And what should I do? You have to obey my every order. I talked with Viola. She told me about the police. And you know about it too. I feel bad. I'm sorry because I care about you. You betrayed me. Yes. I betrayed you. And I also betrayed Viola. And also the Group in Milano. But you knew about it. I told you and you understood. I'm a liar, Desideria. But this is reality. Do you understand? Yes or No? Bravo, Occhipinti. I came to Rome to verify some rumors about you. You lie to a lot of people, eh? You talk too much, Occhipinti. - Don't shoot! Killer! Didn't you know we belong to a group of killers? He was planning to kidnap your mother and, when you found out, he was embarrassed and killed himself. Get in. Come on.
