[ HEAVY BREATHING ] [ EXPLOSIONS; GUNFIRE ] [ HEAVY BREATHING ] [ GASP ] [ METALLIC SOUNDS OF ZORDS FIGHTING ] When two empires declare war... neither side is innocent. You're still a traitor, you worthless piece of... We were children, asked to fight an intergalactic war against an enemy we'd never met. Let's stop pretending OUR side stood on some moral high ground. What do you want, Rocky? Where's Tommy? [ SIRENS BLARE ] [ RAT SQUEAKS; BOTTLE CLANKS ] [ AIRSHIP WOOSHING OVERHEAD ] [ BEEPING SOUNDS; MECH FOOT STOMPING ] [ HIGH-PITCHED SCANNING SOUND ] Tommy Oliver is a ghost. You'll never find him. I don't even know where he... [ FACE PUNCH; METAL CHAINS CLANK ] Bullshit is an ugly color on you. I prefer pink. If dying is what you choose to do here today... I would prefer you did it with your dignity intact. How soon after the truce did you turn? Did you even wait until we were disbanded? The second the Machine Empire integrated their technology into our society, I knew the freedom we'd bled for was done. So you stabbed us in the back? I followed the only rule worth following in this fuck storm: I made sure I was on the winning side. Which is why I'm sitting here and you're chained to a chair. Comfortable? You were never really one of us. Thank you. Who'd've thought that weaponizing youth and training them to kill could have turned out so ugly for so many of them? We were a team. We fought for each other. You never understood that. Let's talk about Jason. What about him? You were married to him, weren't you? For eight hours. [ LOUD KNOCK ] [ GUNFIRE ] NOOOOOOOOOO! D'you know why they did it? Bulk: Got a little tired of being made fun of by you cunt fucks. [ SKULL LAUGHS ] Bulk! Skull! You sold us out! [ GUN BUTT THUD ] Machine Empire had better meth. That was all it took. You know what happens to a dog that chases cars and finally catches one? [ LIGHTS BUZZ ] It doesn't end well for the dog. Let's move on to Zack, shall we? Good kid. Fit. Little hyperactive. D'you know where he ended up? About those Hip Hop Kido tapes... Zack: Hip Hop Kido! Let's kido. And Abs! Abs! Light 'em up. Knee 'em up! Work it! Count it! & punch! Work it! Hip Hop Kido! Let's go! [ PUNCHING ] He knew it was bullshit, but the public ate it up. It wasn't about the money for him. He's... ... addicted to the action. That was his outlet. And you think peddling false hope to fat kids was enough to scratch that itch for him? Did you know he joined the Machine Empire? Didn't even have to recruit him. He was so hungry for a battlefield, he volunteered to help us sweep up whatever resistance was left. [ GLASS SMASHING; GUNS COCKING ] If you hand over the general, all your lives will be spared. If you don't, well... I know YOU. You're that black man with the exercise program. Is this some kind of joke? Damn. And I know you motherfuckers bootlegged my shit too. You have a nice body! Kill him! Oh! Do you have any last words? It's morphin' time. [ THUD ] [ CRASH ] [ GUNFIRE; COMBAT SOUNDS ] [ KNIVE SLASHING SOUND ] [ KNIFE COMBAT SOUNDS ] Most people play the odds. But then there are those rare few who just don't feel alive unless the odds are stacked completely against them. I knew you'd get me. It's all good. Get on with it. Itâ€™s tough seeing your friends murdered, one by one... ... especially by one of your own. What the fuck are you talking about? Think about it. Rita made Tommy to fight against us. And then he betrayed her, switched sides, mommy tried to kill him, then he lost his power, gained it back, lost it again, only to see a fucking treaty signed? I'm... ... I'm glad I'm not his shrink. Say what you want about the Machines: at least they're consistent. What does this have to do with me? Tommy's always been hung up on you. [ DOOR WOOSHING OPEN ] Yesterday Tommy paid a visit to Billy Cranston. But don't worry, I think we all know it's unlikely you fucked him too. Our alliance with the Machine Empire will bring a new level of synergy within Cranston-Lockheed Martin. We will be mass producing our signature Blade Blaster weapons with an initial order of 1.6 trillion euros from the Soviet Europe. Damn it, Billy. What d'you do? You're out of your mind! Tommy didn't kill any of us. He's a Ranger. You just forgot what that means. Why do you think they gave these powers to kids? Hmmmmm? Because we were the only ones who could destroy Rita and her- You are NOT that stupid! For fuck's sake! Pull your shit together and start thinking, for yourself. For once in your life! You're not a little girl any more. Now where's Tommy? Go fuck yourself. [ MACHINE NOISES ] [ CHAIR SCRAPING ] You think you're defending something worthwhile. I get that. But technology? The Machines? They always win. I told you, I haven't seen Tommy since- [ SUDDEN YELP OF PAIN; CRACKING SOUNDS ] One last warning. Every move we make leaves a footprint. Trini's funeral. While the government was negotiating the treaty, we were burying our own. I saw him for a moment, and then he was gone. It's been years. You're telling the truth. The Machines are never wrong. They told us exactly what you'd know. So, you lose. Oh Kimmy: you really just don't get it, do you? We never needed you as a witness. You, my dear, are bait. [ GUNFIRE; SWORD COMBAT SOUNDS ] [ METALLIC SWORD UNFOLDING SOUND ] [ SWORD CLANG ] [ MACHINE NOISES; SWORD SCRAPING ] [ SWORD COMBAT SOUNDS ] [ GUNSHOT ] [ HEAVY BREATHING ] Who are you? I'm Kimberly. No. You're not. I held Kimberly in my arms when she died. So I'm going to ask you one more time. WHO ARE YOU?! [ CHAINS BREAKING ] [ SKIN CRACKING ] Kill. Stab. Drown. Sleep. Shoot. Don't you remember me darling? I'm the one who turned you a Ranger in the first place. I've killed them all and now the world is ours. [ SCREAM ] Rita... [ SCREAMS ]
