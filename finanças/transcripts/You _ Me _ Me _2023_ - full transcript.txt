For example, planes might fall, nuclear weapons might automatically be launched, according to Nostradamus' prophecy that the end of the world would come this year. Nonsense. However, it's fortunate that Thailand stored data in BE year system... What did you ask Dad for? We asked to go to the English camp. Dad said yes. Please, Mom. Everyone in our class is going.

I kept it in the storage room. But I don't know where exactly. You. Do you think Mom and Dad will break up for real? Mom brought so much stuff like this. It makes things even more suspicious.

You, I'm the teacher's assistant. Come on, let's study outside. You want some? What a coincidence. I didn't think I'd see you again. Can't you remember me? On the day of the re-test. I let you borrow my pencil. Oh, the guy who lent me the pencil. Farang, right? "Farang" is what my friends tease me with. Actually, my name is Mark. Oh. Like Marky Mark? Huh? What? I'm just teasing you. You're teasing me? Now I feel less nervous. I never thought I'd meet a schoolmate here. But I'm not at that school anymore. I already quit. Oh? Why? My parents broke up. My dad went back to his country. So I came to live with my mom here. And are you okay with it? Yeah. If they don't love each other, it's better to break up. Really, I'm fine. And did you move to study all the way here? Nope. I'm not studying anymore. I'm going to focus on playing the phin. I can earn money too. Why do you want to learn the phin? Well, I used to study it when I was a kid. But I stopped. Picking it up again is like starting all over again. Hey, it's not hard. I'll teach you. Try this one. It's not too hard. Then play with the right hand like this. Mark, I wouldn't take you as a good player. But when you play the phin, you look so cool. Come on. Is that praise or an insult? - I really mean it. - Okay.

His eyes are brown. His eyelashes are so long. Longer than ours. His eyebrows are thick, a bit untidy. When he smiles widely, his fang shows too. I like how his shoulders are broad. But he's also got a slight hunch. Kinda looks dorky. But altogether, he's so awesome! Here, feel it. Mark, run away! - You is a slut! - Hey! Me! You're in deep. Me! Me. Have you ever kissed? No. Not even with the guys you've been talking with? If I did, you'd know, wouldn't you? What do you think a kiss feels like? - Gosh! - Like this! If that's it, I could just kiss the dog.

They say when a star falls, you can wish for anything, and it'll come true. If there's a meteor shower, then we can make loads of wishes. That's right. - Awesome! - Awesome! Oh, You, I've been meaning to ask. What is it? Do you turn on the speakerphone? Every time we talk, there seems to be an echo. Oh, yeah. So I can lie down and talk with you. Hey! Then Me can hear us too? Well... yeah. Hey, can you turn it off? I might accidentally drop some lame joke. It's embarrassing. Then, hold on. Are you okay? Hello? I turned it off already.

If he meets me, will he know I'm not you? Of course. Mark and I have become close now. He should be able to tell us apart, right? How do you know? The view here is the nicest. Yeah. True. What? Why do you keep looking at me? You look different today. I don't know why. It's not like the usual You. I'm especially prettier today. As usual. So, usual or unusual? Well, pretty, as usual. Don't get upset. Hey, why did you break your pencil for me back then? The re-test? Yeah. I wasn't thinking. And what if you couldn't find a cutter? Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'd fail. I don't know. When I left school... I didn't regret anything except not getting to see you again. And then we met out of the blue. I'm really happy. You, you have a mole? I thought Me is the one with the mole. Let's go! Where are you in a rush to? It's not even time yet. Hurry it up. You! You! You! Mark! What about Me? Where's Me? Me? Where's Me, Mark? Don't jump! Me! Me! Are you all right? Stop crying already. I'm all right. I'm okay now. We're sorry for pranking you. Man! I guess this is how it feels to have the twin switcheroo pulled on you. - So, who's the oldest and the youngest? - I was born later, but I'm the oldest. Me was born first, but she is the youngest. According to traditions. Who made these traditions? I don't believe that. Just go along with who was born first. There isn't any older or younger one. Sure, whatever you say. And, like, do you have some telepathic sense between you two? - We only talk at the same time. - We only talk at the same time. - Like this! - Like this! Awesome! But, actually, there are some times that I suddenly feel weird. How? Suddenly, I'd get a fright. Like what just happened. I've never felt like that before. Is it all in your mind? You are always anxious. I don't know. Twins are just ordinary people. But I don't think it's ordinary. It's extraordinary. The both of you. I knew it, you'd be here. Me. Between the two of us, if someone were to die first, what would we do? That's not fair at all. We were born together... but in the end, we have to die alone. I can't even imagine how I'd live alone. Nah, I just don't want to think about it. I'd see you every time I look in the mirror. I don't want to wake up and have to... take a bath... eat... and leave the house alone. I don't want to do everything alone. Don't say that. I thought you didn't want to think about it. You're the one who started it. But actually, we can both die together. If we live together until the day the world ends. Well then, if it really ends this year, that'd be nice. Psycho! You're the psycho. Ladies and gentlemen, join us at our annual temple fair from the 20th to 25th of November 1999. Most importantly, we have the Krasue show. When you're free from work, bring your kids... Granny.

I want to see the Krasue show. The announcement on that truck, right? Yeah. I've already made plans with Mark. - Then I'm going with you guys too. - Can we go together later? I want to go with just Mark. It's my first date. Nothing special. Just what I normally eat. Okay? My granddaughters come to visit... FERRIS WHEEL Wanna shoot pop guns? Okay. - Really? - But you shoot it. - Won't you play? - I don't know how. Try it. Just try. I don't know how. You shoot, Mark. Try it. - Well... - Give it a try. Can I speak to Toh, please?

You want to make up with me, right? Follow me. There's no one here. C'mon. I'll show you something. KRASUE SHOW This is where the Krasue show was. How was it? I can't imagine it. I'll tell you about it. Try imagining along with me. She is this woman who looks so fed up. Damn, she really is fed up. Try getting closer. Boo! I also got startled just like you. It was worth ten baht. Yeah. Come. I'll show you more. Here, there was a pop gun stall. I hit the target too! What a fluke. Then I can do it too. For sure. Did you have some cotton candy? I already ate some for you. You crazy! Is that even possible? And right here, there were lots of people dancing. Their moves were on fire. Any better than us right now? The flower pot crackers were beautiful. I wished we saw them together. Oh, and did you ride the carousel? Yup. But they weren't horses. Me. I have something to tell you. Spill it. You. Can we go steady? He whispered just like that! I was sitting on the carousel, but it felt like I was on a roller coaster. I'm jealous. Me, can I be Mark's girlfriend? And what if I don't let you? Come on, Me. Me. Yesterday, you didn't even invite me. Not even a single word. Then from now on, let's go out altogether as three. Okay? I won't leave you out, ever. I promise. Okay. I won't forget that we had one another on this day I won't forget the happiness we once had together No matter who else I meet in this life I will always have you kept in my heart I'll save it My heart is for you and only you What are you singing? Totally off-key! It's not like you play it any better! Like this. Left, left, left. Keep straight. Gosh, it's so hard. Just be patient, you'll get it. First of all, you need to stop being rowdy. Well, it's scary. Come and give it a try. Don't be all talk. Sure. Bring it on. Hey! Take it easy. See? I told you it's hard. Just wait and see. Okay. That's right. Me, you can do it now. Oh, what happened? Are you okay? Did you get scratched up? Nothing much. It's far from the heart. A leaf. It's sweet. The only difference between you two is that Me has a mole but You doesn't. That's it? Yes. Our height, weight, clothes and shoe sizes are all exactly the same. But I think you two aren't the same at all. How so? Me, you are a bit more stubborn. Isn't You stubborn? You? You is serious and follows rules more. She's somewhat stubborn, but silently stubborn. While Me... you are openly stubborn and like a gangster. How do you know? Are we close? Yeah? Isn't it weird? We just met but it's like we've known one another for ages. It might be because... you are You's twin so we clicked faster. I don't feel that we're close. Is it all in your head? Oh? Where are you going? I'm leaving. Huh? Is your hand all right now? I'm fine. Careful, stubborn girl! It's time to get off. I'll take you girls home. I'll ride you home myself. Get on, kiddos. Mark, hold on tight. Hey! Wait... Whoa! Me, drive carefully! I'm sorry. See you later. I'll take you out for a ride again, kiddo. Woah! That's enough. Tame it down. Bleh! Aren't you coming in? Go ahead first. Here, take this. Mark, are you going to leave now? Well, yeah. I don't want you to leave. Don't be like that. I won't be able to leave. Shall we... try kissing? Right here? Everyone's inside already. No one will see. I want to try it like in the Hollywood movies. Mark, why do you like me? That question is embarrassing. Not as much as what we just did. Well. Because you're kind. The day we had the re-test, you let me copy your test. It totally impressed an idiot like me. I liked you since that day. Oh, you're quiet. Do you remember? Yeah, of course, I do. And... do you feel the same? Yeah. Aren't you going to wash up? I'm too lazy. I'll go first then. So? What did you talk to Mark about? Nothing. Just stuff.

I already have a boyfriend. He's good-looking too. Here. He sent me a letter and his picture too. Isn't he fine? Whoa! Your boyfriend is as good-looking as a celebrity. His name's Toh.

I need to pee. Go with me. Me. Recently, Granny's been complaining to me that hiring you isn't worth it. You're not really helping at the shop since you're always out with us. "Us"? Did you mean you and Mark? Yeah. You don't have to come with us all the time. Stay and help Granny with the shop. Just say what you want to say. Fine, I admit.

I'll find a way on my own. I'll get the job soon. It means you're jobless now? How about this? - Let one of the girls live with me. - Are you crazy? How could you separate them? They won't agree to it. So, what do you want? You want them to tough it out with you? Don't you think that's a bit selfish? Think about their future. So, what's your decision? No matter what, I'll have to talk with them first. And if they agree, who would you choose to live with me? It probably would be You. Well, try talking with them first then.
