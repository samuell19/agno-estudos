I always said to whoever wanted to write my biography... ...that my favorite fantasy would be: me and my daughter Nonoca by the mouth of the Coruripe River, dancing and devouring human flesh, that of a Portuguese bishop, just like my ancestors, the Caetés, did four centuries ago. And the fundamental fact never understood by the bourgeoisie... is that I have Amerindian blood and a savage appetite. Now, as the Brazilian Ambassador at the English Court, I'm preparing the European bourgeoisie for a new cultural standard that will be consolidated throughout the world, and it will come from Brazil. From Brazil! This is my Amerindian ancestors' vengeance against the Brazilian and the world's bourgeoisie. Extra! Extra! "The Trial of the Century," live across the entire country! Don't miss it! Extra! We arrived, sir. Jeez, he speaks Portuguese. I-- I'm not feeling well. Doesn't it show? I had a hallucination, you know. Let me take a look. -It's just... -Easy, easy. I was at a party in London and... Dr. Assis, you came to participate in the show. -You are not sick. -You had a blood clot. Dr. Assis, you came to participate in the show. You are not sick. You had a blood clot. Dr. Assis, you came to participate in the show. You are not sick. You had a blood clot. Dr. Assis, you came to participate in the show. You are not sick. You had a blood clot. The Night Show The Trial of the Century I'm glad you woke up, Assis. Is that you, Maria Eudóxia? What is going on? Today is your day, Assis. -What day? -You have to be impeccable. Five minutes, Dr. Assis. Come on, come on, Assis. Get dressed. Only if I'm dressed as a Tupi. A real Tupi. My God, what am I doing here? If he didn't die, he will. Any time now. -Poor man. -"Poor man," what? He deserved it. What's the point of 26 newspapers, 14 radios, four magazines, 12 television stations, when they are all deep in debt? We are going to pay the price. Thank you very much. I just hope he doesn't die. On the other hand, he can last years like that. Can you imagine how much that's going to cost us? You mean, how much is that going to cost him. Him! Do you have a lighter, Ted? Afrânio, in front of him? The thing he hated most. Exactly. Eight years inside a lifeless body. I already asked witchdoctors, doctors and charlatans for help and nothing. Nothing gets me out of this paralysis that the blood clot brought me to. My empire fades away day after day. Today, I am what I write. Letter by letter. Day after day. The senator is immortal. His body can be viewed in the Academy or in the Federal Senate. No. The ambassador hasn't died yet. Don't fool yourself. The man writes and grunts like never before. His weapon is the writing! The writing! With one finger. One finger! Without reservation, Dr. Assis supports the revolution against the red crooks who are robbing the Planalto Palace. Tell the presidency to not come with fiddle-faddle. To give orders inside the Associated, you have to take over our paychecks. The government cannot abandon us like that. We are losing our most important artists. This contract with the Americans is illegal. It's antipatriotic, it's illegal. What do you want? Destroy the Associated Diaries? It's been almost two years without a cent from the government. There's no reason for such a cowardly act. I'm ready for this battle of life and death. Fucking military. Now they are partners with a criminal paid to destroy radio and television. I want Mr. Rosemberg arrested with his head shaved like a common criminal. Repeat after me, son: "Immortal is the one who creates beauty." No stuttering. One more time. Repeat: "Immortal is the one who creates beauty." I learned how to speak while getting beat up by my grandpa. Such amazing circumstances rarely come together all at once to amuse the soul of a human being... ...so dull and stupid that they cannot put words together in a manner to convey their thoughts. On the contrary, there is no other animal however perfect and fortunately situated it may be, that can do the same... I studied, I studied so much, I became a lawyer and a journalist. As a lawyer, I didn't like to charge any fees. Leverage, in the future, is everything. Dr. Assis, I can't accept that. I'll sign you on with Brazilian Traction as a regular attorney. And that's an advance. Money, newspaper and leverage. In that order. You better hide that newspaper. The boss doesn't like lazy people. I don't want to lose my job. Be more careful, man! Severino, being careful is the same as being mediocre. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life cutting cloth behind this counter. I don't want to die as the scissors man. That's not my calling. I'm going to work at this newspaper. Oh, come on! Stop dreaming, Francisco. Get up and help me cut this cloth. And one more thing: the lady who owns this newspaper lives in Rio de Janeiro. I'm going to go there and ask her for a job, and she's going to hire me. On the right. Hey, young man. Now this, huh? This is not possible, boy. You are not good at this kind of job. Actually, I would like to tell you something, ma'am. -Speak. Speak. -I never wanted to be a servant. I'm in law school, I speak a little bit of German. Hey! Stand up. I would like another job. You offered me a job as a servant, and I didn't want to say no, but I actually wanted another job. -Okay, but what other job? -As a journalist, Mrs. Germana. Why would you want to be a journalist? -Why? Because I have an opinion. -Ah, come on. Opinion. Those with an opinion shouldn't be an employee, but the owner of a newspaper. You are right, ma'am. I don't have a newspaper. I only have an opinion, which is halfway there. You have opinion. So, what? An opinion? Who cares? Excuse me. Look, Mrs. Germana... why are the ads in your newspaper so small? So, there's room for the news. My newspaper sells news. Forgive me my audacity, but who pays for your Château Laffite? The ads, not the news. Ads are money. The news is a bonus. -Young man, this one. -Sorry. Leave it. Ads are good even for those who like the news because that's where the salary of those who make the news comes from. Do you agree with me, Mrs. Germana? Ladies and gentlemen, a special round of applause to the man who, with his courage, changed our history. The man who stole from us, who slept with our women. The senator, ambassador, lawyer and journalist: Dr. Francisco de Assis Chateaubriand Bandeira de Mello. Our judges: the mother-in-law Germana Almeida... his first wife Maria Eudóxia... his second wife Lola and daughter Nonoca, his second mother-in-law Mrs. Consuelo, our dearest Soraia Teles, the always-helpful secretary Karina, and the whole legion of women with whom he fornicated with his whole life. Easy, Dr. Assis. The cameras! And now, I'm honored to present to you the primate bishop of Brazil, Dom Sardinha da Gama! I bless this show, which is going to be the window for the Lord's word in the bosom of the Brazilian family. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Shit! If this fucking bishop knew how much a camera costs, he wouldn't have thrown angel's piss on it. And now, our dear Andreia Rodrigues! ON THE AIR My God, this is a nightmare. This has happened before. I must be dreaming. I wonder if Dr. Assis will ever show up. -He must be almost here. -It would be a shame if he doesn't. I would love to meet him. I have to tell them to start serving. Of course. Hello. My dear. What kind of clothes are those? I'm sorry for being late. I was at the newspaper. I was inducting some authorities, some military people, into the Revolutionary Order of the Goons. I've never heard of that. A little bit of Paraíba's tradition to the capital of this Republic. Assis, these are our hosts, Vivi and Stuart Cubing. Nice to meet you. Francisco de Assis Chateaubriand Bandeira de Mello. At your service, ma'am. Ah, the husband is a gringo. The husband is a gringo. Sit down, Mr. Chateaubriand. Dinner is already being served. Great because my belly is empty. -Such a pig! -So nasty! We are going to have pig? Pork rinds? It's delicious. Whoa! Bring the biggest knives we have in our kitchen. Actually, Brazil is a very rich country. But of course, it needs a little help. Not a little help, sir. The correct term is "money." Brazil will only be big if it gets modernized. Don't you read what I have written? Modernization in mining, in metallurgy, in steelmaking. I was accused of giving Brazil away to the Americans. Ain't that right, Dr. Stuart? Okay, invest in the extraction of a very useful metal-- Not just one. In Brazil, we have all of them. I mean only one: niobium. You are a niobium, mister. In Paraíba, we solve those issues with a machete. That's right, start the war. I'm loving it. Just kidding. It's just that "niobium" sounds like cussing made up in Paraíba, not a kind of metal for cannons, and soon, for spaceships. -He's a savage. -Worst kind of Northeasterner. Have you ever imagined rockets from Paraíba, -full of savages from Paraíba? -I don't think they would take off. Mrs. Vivi... -don't belittle my fellow Paraibanos. -Great civilization, the Paraibana. I would say that there was the Egyptian, the Greek, the European and the Paraibana. Mrs. Vivi... you need to go to Paraíba. Dr. Assis, how long are you going to continue with your show? -A prodigious land, a place of geniuses. -We had fun. Don't repeat yourself. -We may get tired. -A land of manly men, good men. -Are you gonna keep talking about Paraíba? -You probably have ancestors from there. We are all very interested. I am absolutely sure that you have to visit Paraíba. Thank you, Dr. Assis. I would prefer to go to Paris. I would like to propose a toast to Getúlio Vargas, -Brazil's future president. -Get up, Assis. I'm a journalist. I have to be neutral. Victory to the revolutionaries and to Brazil's future. Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! Mrs. Vivi, what do you think of me? I think you are worthless. What do you think you are doing, Dr. Assis? Right now, I'm taking off my pants. May I know why? What do you mean "why"? Why did you bring me to this room? That's not it? Are you going pull your pants up, or should I yell and call for my husband? Do you need a man to tell you what to do, Mrs. Vivi? Stop fooling around. We need to have a serious conversation. But I'm being totally serious. You don't have to play hard-to-get with me, Mrs. Vivi. I felt it right here... -that you are crazy about me. -You disgust me, Chatô. All right, then. Why did you bring me here? I want you to meet Getúlio in the south, tomorrow. Getúlio is going to be the next Brazilian president, and if you don't make a deal with him, the competition will. You'll be eaten alive. I've never seen a woman talk like that. I wonder if that's all we are going to do here. -Don't be vulgar, Chatô. -I'm not being vulgar. I want to marry you, Vivi. Now you are being really vulgar. No, no. You didn't understand. I'm asking for your hand in marriage. I can't think of anything more vulgar than marrying you. Why? Is there something wrong with me? Everything. And you are married. So am I. -Actually, very well married. -With that gringo doll? We can be big allies, Chatô. Shall we? I'll leave first, you count to ten and leave. To ten? Do you know how to count to ten? Starts with one, two... five, ten. We had a very generous night. We are making the history of Brazil. Are you only interested in politics? Women can't be interested in politics, right, Chatô? You can be interested in anything you want, Vivi. It was a pleasure having you with us. You are always welcome. -The pleasure was all ours. -All ours! Dear God, Rosemberg! Where were you? We need to talk. Easy, we can talk, but we are late. This stupid show you created, what is it good for? Of all your genius ideas, is this the newest? Unfortunately, it wasn't my idea, because the ratings today-- -How big? -The biggest in history. Whether you like it or not, you are a big star, sir. What do you mean? The whole country wants to see your trial as the King of Brazil. What is this nonsense? Who made that up? If it wasn't you, tell me who it was so I can fire them. I think it was you. After all, it's your last big wish. As you know, the blood clot... Don't tell me about it. I don't want to know. Take me home. Think about it, Dr. Assis. The ratings, the money. The sponsors are delighted. After all, it's Sunday's prime time. -Prime time? -Yeah. -What's the show about? -It's a trial. The guests voice their opinions about you, sir, then the host asks the audience if you go to the throne or not. Cancel this stupid show! I'm not going to be part of this thing. I can't. Dr. Assis, do the show. It's now or never. Face them. Your character is being questioned. Live and in front of the whole country. Fuck you, Rosemberg. Since when does anyone in Brazil have the authority to judge my character? -I want you all to go fuck yourselves! -We are late. -Live-audience show, my ass. -You're going to enjoy it. I am a lawyer first and a journalist second. We are here to fight for our right to justice and denounce the violence of this situation. Mr. João Pessoa was brutally murdered this morning, in Pernambuco, the candidate for the vice presidency of Getúlio Vargas. Mr. Getúlio Vargas spoke before the nation about the fraud in the elections carried out through schemes connected to the party in power. Go, go! Hurry! Here, it's here! Easy, Dr. Assis. These suitcases are too heavy. -What's your name? -Carlos Rosemberg. -New hire? -Photographer intern. Well, Mr. Rosemberg, should I have bought more slaves or hired a squire to carry your suitcase? Mine is light. Yours are heavy. Don't talk to me like that. Do you know who you are talking to? I'm not a beast of burden. I am a photographer. I like it. You didn't get intimidated. You are officially hired. Let's get going with this piece of crap! Getúlio is a visionary! But Washington Luís' troops are bigger. -And what troop wins a war? -What do you mean? Troops are not the ones who win the war. Propaganda wins the war. And the newspaper creates propaganda. And I am the owner of the newspaper, not Mr. Washington Luís. That's it. That's it! Unify the country, connect everything. We need a national press, a newspaper chain everywhere. You got it? Learn from me, you piece of shit! Are you going to keep firing me? I can get mad and give all these photos to the competition. -Ouch! Ouch! -You traitor! You bastard! You jerk! You are fired, Rosemberg! Fired! We better be friends, Dr. Assis. Five minutes, that's all I need. -I see you were waiting for me. -Of course. But the fact that you were late was not a good start. May I begin dictating? The idea is for me to ask and you reply, Dr. Getúlio. That's your idea. Because my idea is that I dictate, and you write it down. Let's make a deal, Dr. Getúlio. You do the revolution and leave the news with me. After all, your revolution needs my newspaper. And your newspaper needs my revolution. Let's treat each other as equals. You know that a strong government needs a strong newspaper. And our press is still pretty slow, isn't it? Well, our printing presses are comparable to the ones in Africa. -We need new machines. -New magazines. In four colors. The print, the paper, the photography, everything must be top-notch. Not only one newspaper, but many, in many states. The best columnists in this nation. A united nation needs a national magazine. From Tarauacá, in the middle of the Amazon... to Santa Maria da Boca do Monte! To the pampas in Rio Grande do Sul. And how much are you going to need? -Around 250 million réis. -500 million réis? No, Dr. Getúlio. I said 250 million réis. I can see you don't know how to negotiate. You always ask for double so you can keep half. Well, in that case, with 500 million réis we can do a bunch of things... Can I begin dictating, Dr. Assis? Of course, Mr. President. Of course. The revolution that will take me to the presidency aspires to a new federalism, a new society. Our foreign-relations policy must support national interests, not North America's imperialist interests. Hope will overcome fear. -Getúlio... Getúlio advances! -Getúlio advances! -Advances. -Advances. Getúlio is the future of Brazil. Getúlio is the future of Brazil. -Future of Brazil! -Future of Brazil! Of Brazil! President Getúlio! President! GETULIO WINS Did you hear what I said, Assis? Of course, of course. Another kid. You're lucky. You are a horrible man. It's better for you that way, honey. Excuse me, I'm going to get Rosemberg to keep you company. He is well paid. You can talk to him and get it off your chest. Hello, Chatô. Finally, something good in the middle of all these lieutenants. -Oh, come on. -Your husband didn't come? Why? Are you interested in him? That woman wants me, Rosemberg. She does! Ladies and gentlemen... I would like to make a toast to our victory. This is the celebration of the union of the Brazilian people under the one and only flag! -Long live Getúlio! -Long live Getúlio! -Long live the new President of Brazil! -Long live the new President of Brazil! -Long live Brazil! -Long live Brazil! You better not, Dr. Assis. -Why not? -Are you going to tell me you don't know? -Know what? -About her and the man. -What man? -Getúlio. -Write it down: Getúlio Dictator! -Dictator? -Getúlio tenentista! -Tenentista? -Getúlio... corrupt! -Corrupt? -Corrupt! -No, Dr. Assis, he's not corrupt. Tell me something, son. If you owned a newspaper, and I was fucking your wife, -what would you call me? -Vivi is not your wife. What would you call me? Corrupt, right? -Corrupt! -Corrupt! -Then write it down: corrupt! -Corrupt! Dictator! Can I help you? What would you like, gentlemen? What's going on? Stop it! Stop it! It's the police, Dr. Assis. They are destroying the newsroom. Calm down, Rosemberg. Calm down. Watch out! Let's go! They are after you! Done! tomorrow's column. Call Alcides. Top right, first page, as usual. And I'm the one who gets screwed. Lift it up. We need to make it longer, Rosemberg. Give it to Alcides! Where's the man? We have an arrest warrant. I don't know. He called me asking to come here and get tomorrow's editorial. "TICO-TICO NO FUBÁ" CAKE MIX EVERYTHING MANUALLY, THEN IN A BLENDER Smart ass. If it were up to me, I would've shut that bastard up a long time ago. You can finish cleaning up this pigsty. TUPI TV presents I ask you: where is my lawyer? "THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY" Who's going to represent the defendant? Even the most basic criminal has the right to a lawyer. Ladies and gentlemen, representing the defendant, the great leader of 1930's revolution and creator of the New State, father of the poor: our dear president Getúlio Vargas! Don't you worry. I got this, Dr. Assis. I can turn around this situation. My God, such a torture. I can't stand this. Rosemberg! Rosemberg! My God! Go, go! Dr. Assis? Of course. Who did you think it was, you fool? -They didn't catch you! -Catch me, Ted? No way! -What's new? -The Minister of Justice -decreed full censorship on newspapers. -We can't talk about politics, unless the story is approved by the government. Brace yourselves for tomorrow's column: Getúlio, the Brazilian monster! -Sir, you need to hide. -Hide? Never! A goon never runs away from a fight. The country calls my name, Manoel. Hello? Yes. Mrs. Vivi? How are you, ma'am? Dr. Assis is not... -Hello, Vivi. -I just called because I'm shocked. It didn't take that long for the fox to show its teeth, did it? He tricked me. He tricked everyone. The whole idea of not calling for elections. Honestly! He is a dictator. You were right. You can't stay there. It's dangerous. -I can't? -I have a country house in Vassouras. Stay there until things calm down. Your country house? She's inviting me to her country house in Vassouras. -I'll keep you company. -Okay. I'll be there. -So, you are going? -Yes. But I'm not running away. I'm just going undercover. Print it the way it is. I had to leave the house for him to notice I existed. The division of assets. The stocks! That was ridiculous. He offered 25 percent of the stock value. What is she talking about? Is it the newspaper? The host asked... how the negotiations of her stocks took place. With an offer to sell them, he sent his own people with a threat. Objection! This is irrelevant for the process of this trial. I gave up and accepted this jerk's outrageous offer... before he decided to have a member of my family killed, like he usually does. -What a monster! -He's not worth a dime! I need a few minutes to talk to my client. Is it possible for us to have a break? THE MEDIOCRITY OF THE REVOLUTION Vivi! I missed your smell. This is a very hard situation, Chatô. Let's have a talk. Vivi, are we going to spend the entire time talking about politics? -Let me look at you. -It's not politics! Think about your company, your family. What if he decides to hurt you for real? You attacked him. Come on. It looks like you are in a diplomatic mission. I'm here as your friend. That's why you should back up -and calm this whole thing down. -I'm not backing up. I didn't betray the principles. He did, that scoundrel. Hey, Vivi. We are crazy wasting all this time. You are crazy. That's why I like you. -I have to go. -Where are you going? I have a meeting. If I knew you were leaving, I wouldn't have come. I have to go. -Are you coming back? -Yes. -Can I wait for you? -Yes. Then I'll wait for you. Enjoy the farm. Time flies over here. So, it is really you, Dr. Getúlio? -Someone must be playing with me. -Of course not. I'm here as a volunteer. No one else wanted to do it. I understand. I'm doing everything they asked me, but I still want to know what is going on. Exactly what it looks like. Judgment Day. I've been through all of this as well. Calm down. Take a deep breath. You have to trust me. I can help you. Are you still mad? That's so silly. How can I trust you? You tricked the whole country. Allies and enemies. Come on. We have to do what is necessary. You know how things work. What did you say again? "We are both the same. The same kind of scoundrel." -Good, very good. -But it was meant as a compliment to you. Exactly. That's why you have to trust me. Nobody knows you better than I do, Chatô. You know it. Wherever there's injustice, I'll be there. They are going to use every single action of yours to defame you. You are going to become a monster, just like you did to me. They are going to use all the women. I love women, and they love me. -And your family. -Shit! -What's wrong? -Nothing. Come on, Chatô. I know you. Say it! Nothing else matters. She's the one who gave me up that night. Of course it was. What is this? Who are you? Get your hands off me. Do you know who you are dealing with? I am Assis Chateaubriand! Great. You are the one we were looking for. They caught me trying to take guns to the opposition in Minas. The day I get free, I'll have to thank Getúlio for the most violent vacation he offered me. Mother of God! -What a feast! -That's a good start, huh? Everything for me? What a feast! You must be very important, sir. Vivi. Give all this food to my buddy next door, including the champagne. Go! As an order from the dictator and his piece-of-shit lieutenants, I'm rotting in a prison called Liberty. It's an ironic twist of fate, that the political prisons in Brazil have lovely names: Liberty and Paradise. Lírio. -Lírio! -Sorry, doc. -What is going on? -It's Lunchtime. -I'm not hungry. -No, doc. Lunchtime is the name of the show, for fuck's sake. We need to go back to work, Dr. Assis. We all want that. The financial losses are mounting. Are you still working for me, Rosemberg? You have to back up, sir. Never! And even if I did, you would still be fired. Sir, if you don't stop attacking Getúlio every single day, he's going to get another newspaper to support him. Getúlio agreed to free you. The newspapers will be able to work again. There's only one thing: you can't go after Vivi. Never again. That's the deal. There's no deal. I like it here. Jailer! Jailer! Get this traitor out of my cell. Maria Eudóxia left the house. She wants a divorce. She is still the owner of O Jornal. -Jailer! -Owner! Not my newspaper. Tell that dictator son of a bitch that I'll back up. What about Vivi? She fucked with me already. For me, one fuck is enough. Now go, Rosemberg. Negotiate with my wife her share of the newspaper. Be a good Jew at least once in your life. -Now go! Go take care of that riffraff. -Me? Yes, you are re-hired, you lost scoundrel. Don't lose the war, Rosemberg! The war! How do you say it in the pampas? Chinoca Buenacha. A good woman. I have something to ask you. Coming from you, it's an order. You can't say no. I promise I won't say no. -Tell the police to release Chatô. -No. Why not? He helped you so much. I can't release him. It would set an awful precedent. I don't know why he joined the opposition in São Paulo who bears arms against me. He should know that if they are prejudiced against me, they are equally prejudiced against him. They eat me for lunch and him for dinner. These corrupt people hate anyone without a lineage going back 400 years. I'm not going to release him. This is not a joke. I know it's not a joke. Be democratic. The only democracy Chatô knows... is in his own pocket. -You are a true gentleman. -Come on, Lírio. -It was my pleasure. -Come on, doc! Well, I got something here for you, sir. -It's just a simple thing. -For me? But this is wonderful, Lírio. Thank you so much. I still owe you, sir... after all that food you gave me. Listen... if you ever need Lírio... you know where to find him. He's here. He's here. The sleeping giant will wake up to the sound of the radio stations that we are going to spread around the whole country. -How is our finance? -You made a good deal with the boss. The boss paid off all our debts. We are doing good. Thanks. We even did a remodel. Now here's one thing: next time you refer to that monster as "the boss," you all are going to be fired! Understood? Now, listen. I am very proud to announce at this moment... the creation of Tupi Radio! Thank you very much! This is wonderful! Spoken newspaper, ten kilowatts. This is madness! We are competing against ourselves. -News through the radio. And free! -No! The sponsors will pay for the publicity. They are crazy about it. We are going to fill Brazil's ass with news. We'll play Northern music in the South and vice versa, São Paulo's music in Rio. It's going to be crazy. Write down what I'm saying. -Bravo, Dr. Assis. Bravo. -Your enemies better be careful. Bravo! My enemies better be careful, Rosemberg. Where's my elixir? -I don't have it. -Afrânio? I've got such an urge. Stop the car! Stop! Stop! Honey, here's a phone number. Give me a call. You are not going to regret it. Oh, mommy! This girl is so pretty. Anything you need, Mommy. I know how to make them, too. Such a pretty blondie, huh? Give me a call. Here's my number, okay, Mommy? Both of you. Ma'am, you can't go in there. -Excuse me! -I'm so sorry, sir. -What is going on? -You don't remember? -You gave me your business card. -Business card? -You know... -At the bus stop. -Oh, yes. -So, I came here, right? After all, you promised. Enough! So, what do you think? Great. Great! Sing, girl! Sing! She's a prodigy! Honey, you will be the queen of our radio. You pay the double, and we sign a contract of exclusivity. She's all yours. I mean, not yours. No. The Tupi Radio's, right, Dr. Assis? If she's a virgin, I'll pay. But it's going to depend on the test. How come, Dr. Assis! Do we have a deal, Mrs. Consuelo? Yes, of course. Obviously. -She's going live. -Lola Branches. My little angel. QUEEN OF THE RADIO To celebrate the pre-contract... of our pre-pact, and of course... our pre-nuptials. To you! Cheers! It's worth the score! Come on, come on! QUEEN OF THE RADIO COMPETITION Lola Ouch, ouch, baby! CHATÔ AND LOLA: HONEYMOON IN NEW YORK Kiss me Keep your face close to mine Kiss me I'll give my life for your kiss Kiss me I want to feel your perfume... On my way! Kiss me with all your love Otherwise, I'll die of jealousy What a good thing A kiss from my baby Saying like that sounds like... Enough! What a crazy thing What a wonderful taste Come here. When I put my mouth In your coral lips No, no and no! Enough! Chatô! No, no, no. No, Chatô. We're married. I'm your husband. I have the right! -Enough of this crap. -No, no! I said no. No and no! Are you cheating on me? Are you cheating on me? I want my mother! I want my mother! You are cheating on me! You are cheating on me! Can you tell me why you brought me here? Didn't you want to be a collector? This is one of the best auction houses in New York. And it's rare... These crazy people are paying 25,000 for this skinny man? Don't be an ignorant, Chatô. It's a Modigliani! Mondi-what? -You paid too much. -Of course! If this stingy people are paying that much in the middle of a crisis, can you imagine how much it is going to be worth later? ASSOCIATED DIARIES -Now we can buy everything. -Dr. Assis? At the same time, I want to build a museum of modern and contemporary art -just like the museums around the world! -Dr. Assis. I want Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Tintoretto. Good morning! Now you appreciate the fine arts? Who said I appreciate the fine arts? Art is power, my friends. It represents status. It's about time to educate these 50 million uncivilized Brazilians! -Let's give them Picasso! -Let's give them Picasso! It looks like New York transformed you into a communist collector. Exactly. From now on, I don't care about capitalism. Long live Cubism! I'm going to release the beast called Assis Chateaubriand to rip out the guts of the industrialists... and castrate the bankers! I meant it! I'm obsessed with the capital content. Do you have any idea of how much that's going to cost us? Millions! Millions! Millions! Who said I'm asking you for money? I am going to get money. I'm going to charge taxes. Taxes! What taxes, Dr. Assis? Only the government can charge taxes. The Associated Diaries as well. We live in one of the richest countries in the world, but our millionaires are stingy. I'm going to charge them the debt for our people's ignorance. They are going to pay for the fine arts. With a machete in my hand, I'm going to be the bourgeoisie's nightmare. It's me, Chateaubriand, Dr. Rauscher! Did you receive my proposal? Dr. Assis, if you are trying to put pressure on me, you better not even try. You will not get any money from me. Dr. Rauscher, I don't care about your ignorance about art. No. I just want a small donation of three million cruzeiros... and the Brazilian culture will thank you. I guess this will have to go to court then. Another way to enhance the cultural level of my readers, Dr. Rauscher, would be a story about a reputable German chemist who, at night, changes into, let's say, a pimp! You are a blackmailer! And with people of your kind, I should call the police! Ted! Ted! -What happened? -Call Lírio. Hurry! Yes, sir. Ignorant German! Wait till that Nazi sees what happens. Lírio? Dr. Assis wants you here in his office. Yeah. -Rauscher didn't want to contribute. -Dr. Assis, not everyone wants to-- Why not? It's a matter of wanting, it's about having. It's different. It's a tax. I hope you don't have to hurt anyone. Why Lírio? Don't worry. Lírio is a teacher. This is just a reeducation program. You can count on me, doc. -Why are you in a hurry, Chatô? -Now! Go, go, go! It has to be now. I can't wait anymore. Calm down! I have to get ready first. There's no need. It's great as it is. It's great! It's great! Go! Now! I'm ready. Good morning, sir. -Are you Mr. Rauscher? -Yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Enough! Call the office boy. Juvenal! Juvenal! Breaking news to go on the third page. Take it to the typesetting room. Go! Move! Quick! Son of a bitch! Karina! Karina! Dr. Assis, I'm not that kind of woman. Put that thing away. Now you are in love with this so-called television! What about the equipment costs? Where are we going to get all this money? This shot is wonderful. Twenty-five milligrams of Testoviron. You can screw all night long. I was tired of that shitty elixir. Karina! Karina! -Yes, sir? -Write it down. Call Josemar and set a meeting with her at 4:30 p.m. at the apartment on Senhor dos Passos Street. Then-- Pay attention! After that, call Isaurinha and set a meeting with her at 9:30 pm, after I'm done with my editorial. And send them a little gift. Send them a white automobile. Yeah. -Yes, sir. -Now go. She's so hot. Money is not a problem, my friends. Television is money. Cash. Real cash! Cash! How come money is not a problem, Dr. Assis? How come it is not a problem? We are buried in debt. You have worked with me for so long, but it seems like you didn't learn a thing. Credit is what matters, not money. Credit means what? Credibility. A pioneer doesn't buy with money. Now tell me something: who pays the radio? -The sponsors. -The sponsors. Exactly. We'll get it from them. But Dr. Assis, our sponsors are leaving us. Sfering, Fio Luz, the Cola sodas. They think we are charging too much. -The Cola sodas as well? -Yes. Rosemberg, write down tomorrow's headline. "A Cockroach was Found in a Cola Soda Bottle." COLA SODA SALES DROP! Thirty-three, 34. See? Fraud! The box says: "40 matches." Look. Look! Fio Luz is a cheater. They want to trick the people. We need to better scrutinize before publishing this news story. -Yeah, let's double-check this. -You guys are right. I want everyone counting how many matches there are in a Fio Luz matchbox. Matchbox? Count matches? Everyone counting matchboxes. I am the sort of person who always tries to be understanding. Everything has a limit! My responsibility with... Come on! If you stop, you are fired! -Fraud! I told you! Fraud! -Fraud! SAFE MATCHES CONTAINS 40 MATCHES Check out the match fraud! Millions of cruzeiros in stolen matches! Today, in O Jornal. -Dr. Assis. -Dr. Assis. The Cola soda is now paying three times more for advertising with us. Four times more. Fio Luz as well. Retract the stories about the rat, the cockroach, the finger, anything else. -What about the matches? -Just stop publishing that one. Twenty matches is enough to light up any crap. Now we are getting money, Dr. Assis. -We are getting money! -We are bigger than ever! We are leaving. Let's go. Residents of Rio Grande do Sul, abandon the wheat and grasses, feed the sheep and make a lot of money. Let's import cars, champagne and French women. Much better! An undead removed from society. Despite of that, I continue to write. Nonstop, since 1960. The new presidential candidate wants to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro. Great! They could move it to the Baixada Fluminense. Way more civilized than that desert in Goiás. I'm alive thanks to my sweet nurse... and my doctors. Bring us one more, come on! Show us. Show us! Here. It's here. Bravo! SFERING'S NEW ELIXIR CAUSES CANCER! Dr. Assis. Dr. Assis! Say it, Rosemberg. Say it! -I've been thinking. -Just say it, man! Spit it out! -You know Sfering? -Of course I do. -What do you think? -It's wonderful. It's wonderful! Sit down. You are an exceptional columnist. -Right, Ted? -Yeah. Manoel? Afrânio? Exceptional. Then why don't you publish my articles? Those shitty articles? You pay me to write those shitty articles. Your articles do not reflect the opinion of the Associated Diaries. -They reflect my opinion. -You have an opinion? I have an opinion. Then get your own newspaper because I'm the only one with an opinion here. I quit! No, no, no. You are fired. This time, I quit first. That's what you think! You were already fired! I will start my own newspaper. Will you? Do it, and you'll see what happens. I bring you the people's herald, the owner of newspapers and magazines, Carlos Rosemberg! This is crooked! This is crooked! -This man has no class! -Ma'am, did you have a sexual relationship -with the defendant? -You son of a bitch! -Don't be shy. -Son of a bitch. Do you ladies agree that this man, Assis Chateaubriand, steals from the people, rapes little girls... and is a horrible father? An adventurer with no conscience, who only caused damaged to the country? How can you say that about me, you faggot? I've done for this country more than all of you together. This television thing is going to be a fiasco! Five million dollars in equipment. It's going live next week. -How many people are going to watch? None. -None! None! There's not a single television in the whole country. Easy, Ted. There's a solution where we're headed. -Come on, Afrânio. -Be patient. The man knows what he is doing. Can you see what the man is doing? Of course they are not fridges. They are TV sets. There wasn't enough time to import them for the opening day. It's all contraband. It was a pleasure. Thank you. Where do I sign? -Everything was delivered, sir. -Thank you very much. And as promised, the boss sends his regards. Brazil is joining a new era... where we can let our imagination fly. -Hooray! -Hooray! -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Congratulations, Dr. Assis! -Thank you. -Hello, Chatô. See you later? -Vivi. INVICTUS TV SETS Tell us if the defendant can't be considered a dynamic man. Charitable, visionary, diplomatic. I would say he is very eccentric... expressive, has a lot of passion. Very Brazilian. I would like to recall a certain time, in New York, at the NBC studios. He came to visit... to purchase the black-and-white equipment. What do you think? Do you like Olímpio José? He's handsome. We have to be careful, Mr. President. Mrs. Vivi likes to bluff a lot. Oh, I love cigars. -You would be a great man, Vivi. -Or a great president. Lucky for you guys, I'm a woman. Two for me, please. -How many cards, Mr. President? -Give me three. I don't want any. -I'll bet 10,000. -Wow, so furious! All right, let's face the lion. I see your 10,000, and I raise you 30,000. -I'm out. -Here it is. It's worth more than 30,000. You know I always pay to see. How many cards, Mr. President? You better not, Dr. Assis. Are you going to tell me you don't know? About her and the man. You better not, Dr. Assis. My daughter is going to stay with me. Are you going to tell me you don't know? About her and... Bitch. She even took my daughter. I gave you what I had best, Jerônimo. My youth! And you? What did you have to give me? Your money! You cheap tramp! You slut! Slut! Let me go. Get out of my way. Bastard. Traitor! I pay your salary -and yet you fuck my wife? -Help! Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Out! I am Assis Chateaubriand. I came here to report the existence of a dangerous person... an evil person. I'm here to condemn Lola, my wife. That is... my ex-wife. Do you hear me, Lola? You are a cheap prostitute... a cruel mother who exposes her own daughter to all this filth. You're cheap! You're a cow! I might rip off your ear if I see you again. -What is this? No! No! -Let her go! Let her go! Nonoca! Let her go! Son of a bitch. Nonoca! My daughter! Nonoca! I remember that as well. How has he become such a monster? Dr. Assis, Dr. Assis. There are some well-dressed men downstairs with Mrs. Lola. Hold the girl! Oh, it's you? -Mommy! -What are you doing in my house? You tramp! Nonoca, come here! -Who are you? -I am her lawyer. This tramp now has a lawyer, huh? I have custody of her, by law. What law? What do I have to do with that? There's no law in this country that can take my daughter away from me! Get your hands off me. Yes, there is! Then there will be none. You can arrest and release, you can torture and kiss... you can pay and kill... and you are telling me you can't pass a shitty law for your best ally to have his daughter back? That's a scandal! If I do what you are asking me, I'll be on the wrong side of history. I have always done what you asked. But I can't make up a law to get your daughter back! You can't, huh? I want to see if some heads are going to roll or not. Are you threatening me? Are you threatening the president? You don't have to be scared. I'm not going to use this on you, even though you deserve it! I'm going to do something better. Look. -Check this out. Look! -Are you crazy? Get your hands off me. Get your hands off! If you don't pass this law right now, I'll spread my guts throughout your office. I want to see the dictator explain to history what my blood is doing in this shiny floor. Now, come on! Come on! Come on! We have no time to waste. Go! Come on! Mrs. Lurdes. Tell Lourival to pass this damn law. You really are a blackmailing son of a bitch. -I'm here to see the president. -He's busy. Never for me. You are forbidden to go through that door. -Careful how you talk to me, you-- -Black man! With much honor and dignity. Now, please leave. Hello? I have a good one for you today. Terêncio is completely involved in the sale of the warships. He was bribed. Only one arrived. It was supposed to be two. -Mr. President? -This late at night, Vivi? Chatô knows. He called asking about it, but I denied everything. -About what? -The warships. -About Terêncio being involved. -Warships? Terêncio? -What are you talking about? -You don't know, Mr. President? Chatô and Getúlio are fighting each other. Yeah, it's a matter of life and death and a lot of money as well. Before God, I blame only one man for this crime: Getúlio Vargas! As the corruption generates violence, impunity stimulates the criminals. Here's my plea, Getúlio Vargas: resign to save the Republic. Abandon the power, Getúlio Vargas! If you still want any respect as a human being! Your government is not only immoral, it's illegal. It's a government of banditry... of madness. -Dr. Assis. Such an honor. -How are you all? How's everything? -Good. All right. Now, if you excuse me. -Of course. I'm interrupting this program to announce to the nation that president Getúlio was, actually, responsible for the attack against the Brazilian press... which in consequence caused the death of my employee Lírio. God bless his soul. They wanted to shut me up so I couldn't say what I'm saying now. Terêncio, the president's thug, received a bribe in the case of the warships that were never delivered. Only one arrived. The other one is in his pocket. In his pocket! Now you can kiss. Keep kissing, for it's all good. It's all good! Keep kissing! It's all good. One more time, the forces and the interests against the people have been coordinated and are now unfurling over me. They don't accuse me, they insult me. They don't fight me, they calumniate me. They give me no right for defense. A SEA OF CORRUPTION They need to suffocate my voice and contain my action, so I can't defend, as I always did, the people and especially the poor. I follow the path imposed on me. I can't give you anything but my blood. I choose this way of always being around you. When you are humiliated, my soul will suffer next to you. When hunger knocks at your door... you will feel inside you the energy to fight for you and for your children. Every drop of my blood will be an immortal flame in your conscience. To hatred, I respond with forgiveness. And to those who think that beat me, I respond with my victory. But these people, to whom I was a slave, will not be slaves to anyone anymore. My sacrifice will forever be in their souls... and my blood will equate the price of their rescue. After fighting with open arms... hatred, infamy and slander did not break my spirit. I gave you my life. Now I offer you my death. Quietly, I take my first step towards eternity... and abandon life to join history. I prefer to leave. I'll leave the trial in your hands, my dear. Only after some time, the conscience of man will be able to tell... if I was right in abandoning this story. They killed the president. Getúlio is dead! They killed the president! Getúlio is dead! This is my Amerindian ancestors' vengeance against the Brazilian and the world's bourgeoisie. Vivi! Thank you for coming to my party. Getúlio is gone and didn't even say goodbye to me. Well, Vivi... now it's our turn. Just us. No, Chatô. It's still not our turn. But why, Vivi? I've known you for years. I know who you are, I know what you like. -Why, Vivi? -It's your light, Chatô. It's fading away. I don't think there's enough time. I have to go. I'm late. They are waiting for me. -Vivi. -See you soon. My daughter is going to stay with me. We have in our audience today, the unmatched, much-envied, much-desired, biggest heartbreaker of this country. A round of applause to the queen of Brazil, Mrs. Vivi Sampaio. Is it Vivi? I thought I heard him say Vivi Sampaio. Vivi! Do you think Rosemberg is going to get her to say anything? I doubt it. I doubt it. Take it. Mrs. Vivi, with all due respect and in the name of the truth, did you have a romance with the defendant? In a certain way... no. Can you be more precise, please? Did you have a sexual relationship with the defendant? In a certain way... yes. What about you, dictator? Once. Almost. So, from what I understand, Dr. Getúlio, -it was just a platonic romance. -Correct. That means I was jealous for nothing. Maybe. Did you love Dr. Chateaubriand? You loved me, Vivi. You loved me. I didn't love you, Chatô. You know that very well. You never loved any of us. That's a lie! I loved you very much, you wretched woman! Me, him... and that son of a bitch over there. You only loved yourself. You only loved power. What about you, Vivi? Who did you love? Soon we will find out: Chateaubriand is going to the throne or not? Chateaubriand must be tortured! Chateaubriand, that old bastard Stutterer boy became a doctor Wa-wa-wallowing His Ph.D. is to not have decency He built a big empire That's typical of a thief! Once a serious journalist Now more of a bandit Like Virgulino Lampião I don't know if he's a king or a criminal Or if he screwed my Brazil I don't know if he's going To heaven or hell I don't know if he's a king or a criminal Or if he screwed my Brazil I don't know if he's going to heaven or hell ZYB 513. Tupi TV, Rio de Janeiro. "THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY" Good evening, Brazil. We are back with "The Trial of the Century." Have you ladies reached a verdict? Assis Chateaubriand has been sentenced to get off the stage. -Come on. Get up. -They want me to get off the stage. But I ask you: If I leave the stage, who's going to lead the show? Them? I don't think so. You won't be able to stand it! I'm not the monster they say I am. I am much worse. Oh, my God, what a shame! This country is unethical. -Assis! Assis! -Assis! Assis! -Assis! Assis! -Assis! Assis! MARANHÃO VOTES FOR ASSIS CHATEAUBRIAND -Assis! Assis! -Assis! Assis! -Assis! Assis! -Assis! Assis! My God! Don't let this bastard die. CHATEAUBRIAND IN A COMA! My children still need him. Mr. Host... what is our rating at this moment? Ninety-eight points! Everyone is watching! And this is the show you want to take off the air? Why only her? I have the same right. These two are also his kids. Look at their face. Just like him. -Son. -Would you like to say anything? I have nothing to say. I mean: "We are thankful for all the support... and we mourn his absence." Dedicated to my family, my mother Yolanda, Patricia and my children, and especially to my friends, colleagues, fans and admirers who were by my side during the long journey of censorship this film went through.
