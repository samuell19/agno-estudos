Move! Move! Move! Damn. Bingo. Son of a bitch! Good job, Rosello. Can you walk? I think so. Let's get the fuck out of here. I'll meet you back the LZ. Where are you going? I made a fucking orphan back there. I know the amount of guys who're killed, general. I will, sir. We did destroy the ammo dumpster. Yes, sir. I will, sir. Not yet, I was just about ready to, sir. Thank you, general. Goodbye, sir. Do you every wonder, Captain, why you always lose so many men? I know why, sir. Well that's a start. Why? I complete the mission. Rather than having to go in again. Casualties should least surprise you, sir. Knowing full well the kinds of missions I'm assigned, sir. Just what are you insinuating, Captain? You give me the... That you entrust the difficult jobs to me, Colonel. Most officers would be proud if that. Is it too much for you, Rosello? No, no. It simply explains the casualties. Especially considering my success rate, sir. You measure success rather narrowly. You're too slapdash, Rosello. You're like a compulsive gambler. You don't know when to stop. I've explained my reason, sir. Damn it, Rosello, I'm between a rock and a hard place here. You better get yourself a new battle manual and you better get a unit to work for you. Yeah, I will, sir. But I need time! Oh fine, well I'll just go call Ho Chi Minh and tell him Rosello needs time. Here's your new unit, Captain. They're all experienced and they're all good in combat. Get me a damage report! Yes, sir! These men are delinquents. I never said they weren't. All their COs have asked for them to be transferred. I said they were good in combat. Half of them are conscripts. Special forces are supposed to be volunteer. They did volunteer. Yeah, to stay out of prison by the looks of it. Hardly the motivation I need. An officer's job is to motivate his men, Rosello. Dismissed. You need your beauty rest, don't you, Cabrini? Right? Yes, ma'am. Right. Well look, get some rest. I wanna see you up and about as soon as possible. Okay? And Cabrini, that's a direct order. Yes, sir. Captain, sir. Phu Ling. Cabrini's enjoying his stay. He's not exactly your model patient. His wounds won't heal unless he cooperates. You should see how he operates when he's healthy. Look, just assign him a male nurse. He'll heal up quickly. Most of those nurses would be happy to be rid of him. He is a pain in the you-know-where. I know. How about you? Are your wounds giving you any trouble? Only when it rains. I think the cliche is, only when I laugh. Okay. Only when I laugh. It's always raining. You should laugh more. Maybe. As soon as I find something to laugh about. All right, gentlemen. We got Charlies incoming in a few minutes. Let's look sharp. Bogart, P.P. Bogart, P.P. Hard of hearing tonight, Bogart. Today. Tonight. Jackson, D.T. What? What? What? Present. Present. Present, what? Sir. Present, sir. Yes. Good. Good, Jackson. Very good. Lord, John Elijah. Present, sir. - That'll do. - - Elijah. I'll bet you're the kind of little girl who kissed all the boys in school to make them cry, huh? Richter, H.J. Present. Sir. Sterling, E.R. Sterling, E.R. Where's Sterling? Now how the hell we supposed to know that? Sir? Stupid of me to think that you would have friends. Not honkies. We're all brothers under Jesus Christ. That's right, Lord. But in my line, we're silent little monks or you'll meet the big J real soon. I look forward to that meeting, sir. But I take your point. Apes ain't my brothers. As you were, Jackson. See you later. It's been fun. Give me the weapons. Thank you very much. And by the way, see you later! Mr. Sterling, I presume? Hey sir! Yes, sir! Fall in Sterling. Don't you wanna hear my orders first? I just gave you mine, private. Oh. This help you be a better killer, Sterling? What? The bomb, sir? No sir, it helps me live with it, sir. Hey, that's my bomb! Fall in, private! Yes, sir. Stand steady! You move when I say so! 150 yards. Attention. Hundred yards. Holtz? Present, sir. 70. 50. Strzalkowski. 40. Moss. Present, sir. 20, last chance. Navarro! Navarro! Present, sir. That way ladies, move! Bogart, Jackson. Come on, get your shit off this ground! Fuck you! Navarro, get my shit! Okay. Sterling, get the men down to the barracks. Here are the bunk assignments. You can't miss it. It had an E on it. That's kind of you, Captain, but I'm not the leader type. I know that, Sterling, but you're the only one I damn sure knows what an E is. Now move. Just what I need. Another gung-ho commando. Gentlemen, E-Barracks. Home. By the way men, to hell with the bunk assignments. Well Jackson, looks like you and I have the corner to ourselves. You ain't no faggot, are you white boy? Hey, be cool. I don't offend easy so don't even bother to try. Besides, I got peaches. You got peaches? Yeah, I got peaches, baby. Are you a Christian brother? Am I a what? A Christian. Have you opened your heart to Jesus Christ? No, the only think I open my heart to is a Jesus Chrysler. Yep, I think I smell a nigger. Stand by your bunks! All right, that's enough! By your bunks, on the double. Oh. I'm glad to see you're getting to know each other. That oughta catch the light pretty good. You'll be dead the first day. Tape it. Well, at least you found the E-Barracks, Sterling. Stop eye-fucking me, boy. 86 all insignia. We don't want the enemy to know who we are. And gentlemen, try not to kill each other. Jesus. We oughta frag that son of a bitch. Get me an estimate of damages. Yes, sir. Damage report. The new squad is present and accounted for, sir. They may be present but they sure as hell aren't accounted for. Check these lines. That was very funny, sir. Where did you hear that? Gentlemen, gather around. We have a mission. Praise the lord, sir. Summary. We penetrate the north and return with an NVA colonel alive. Not alive. Alive! Everyone else can be dead, Lord. Thank you, sir. Isn't there something about ground forces not going north of the DMZ, sir? We're not ground forces, we're special forces. So I wouldn't know. I wouldn't care and you don't matter. Now listen up! Tranh Um Phu. Key intelligence figure and strategist. HQ needs him alive for interrogation. If they can get him to talk it could shorten the war. I ain't going behind no enemy lines, man. You could always go back to prison, Jackson. Surveillance has established that his convoy crosses the bridge daily at 0900 hours. Wait a minute, define convoy. How many are we up against? Numbers don't matter. The colonel precedes his convoy. As soon as he crosses the bridge, Jackson will blow it to kingdom come. Thy Will be done. In Nam as it is in Heaven. None of you have been north of the DMZ before, so hear this. You men need each other. Any fuck ups and it's a long walk home. Shit. Okay, Jackson. You're on your own. You mean you're not gonna check on me? You're the explosives man. Okay. Come on Jackson, move your ass. Go! Get down! Convoy. Get him! Let's move it! Sterling, fall back! Jackson, get the hell back where you belong! Now! Get up! Get up! Do I blow it? I'm not in charge, man. Did you live? No! No! No! You were out of control, your men were out of control and you weren't working as a unit. Negative, sir. You got your Gook colonel. Mission accomplished. The operation succeeded. You failed! You lost two of your men! They're not my men, they're your men! You gave me these dishrags! You told me they were good in combat! They can't even wipe their own asses! Then you wipe for them! I'm trying to make you a good officer, you dumb wit! My apologies for the discriminatory remark. Coulda been worse, sir. Coulda called me a dumb, narrow-minded, outdated paper shuffler who wouldn't know shit if he ate it. But you didn't, sir. Thou art my hiding place that will preserve me from trouble. Thou will surround me with songs of deliverance. I will instruct you and train you in the way you shall go. I will council you with my eye on you. Be not as the horse, the mule, without judgment who's temper must be cured with bit and bridle or else they come near to you. Many sorrows are to the ungodly, but he who trusts in the lord shall be encircled with love and kindness. Oh, shit. Afternoon, sir. Excuse me, Private Sterling. You wait minute. Me no ready. Bogart, get those men in here. Sorry guys, but the Cap wants us inside, now. Okay, Sterling. You brought her in. You shoot her. What? Till now, the VC have been shelling us daily, but blindly. But if she's a commie, she could draw them a map. She'll pinpoint everything. Bang, bang, we're dead. Shit man. I didn't think of that. Maybe it's just as well you refuse that officer's corner, Sterling. Can't we just arrest her? She can't have seen that much of the camp. She was, you know, under a tarp in the truck. On what charge do we arrest her? There is none. See, you kill her quietly or she kills you. Nice guys finish last, dead. I'll kill her, sir. Can it, shit face. That's why we have rules, gentlemen. To help keep you a live. You find some whore hanging around outside camp, right? Bring her in. Show her around. In then let her go? She's probably given Sterling some new strain of venereal disease. She'll get the rest of you with rockets. Moss, blindfold her and get her out of camp. Oh and gentlemen, you just volunteered for night surveillance. I oughta squeeze on you and save the VC the bullets, Strzalkowski. God, I'm getting sick of this god damn war. No need to worry, my friend. Jesus Christ is watching over us. It's an evil thing you got there. Yeah, well the army says I have to carry it everywhere. No, I'm not talking about that. That's the voice of God. I'm talking about the stuff you're smoking there. It'll get you killed, you know. Yeah, well it helps me relax. I see you carry Charlie's gun. Yes I do. Alas, the Lord has burdened his soldiers with a shit house weapon. I, on the other hand, have taken the devil's tongue and turned it on the devil himself. Stay alert, gentlemen. Gooks. Wait for the word, Lord. That's my word. Sterling, follow me. The light! Hey Jackson, we've got ourselves a familiar face here. Me suck you off. Ten dollar a piece. Jackson, check the handbag. It's safe. No problem. Here Sterling, you're fucked. Take them away for interrogation. Bai Thuong. Flyboys have been complaining about a radar station there. They can't hit it and artillery can't hit it because it's too close to friendlies. You're gonna have to hop in, find it and blow it up. Okay Captain, it's all yours from here. I wanna see it wiped off the map. Yes sir. Hey Jackson, hurry it up. I'm gonna bust a roid waiting for you. Move. Lopez, move it! Give me the detonator, man. The wire. Hit it, Jackson! Phu. I'm sorry, Vic. Listen to my prayer, oh Lord, that my plea for help reach thee. Do not hide thy face from me when I have a distressful day. Turn thy ear toward me. On the day when I call me, answer me readily, for my days go up in smoke. My bones are inflamed as a bonfire. Like grass, my heart is crushed and withered so that I have neglected my regular food. I'm nothing but skin and bones because of the sound of my sign. Okay Captain, that was good work. You're starting to match your potential. Thank you, sir. The guys have a way to go, but they're gonna be good. Sorry about Miller. Yeah, with a little more training time I might have been able to save him. Yeah, well keep working on it, Captain. Dismissed. With the Colonel's permission, I'd like to give the men a pass for the night. They've fought tough and today they came good. No, the records show they're troublemakers. When they get leave, the go separately. But sir, they've fought two tough missions. They're exhausted. They need to relax. There'll be no trouble. I give my word. Bullshit. How can you be show sure about that? I can't, but we owe them. How will they know they've done well if we don't reward them? All right, Captain, they've got their leave. Under your direct supervision. Don't fuck up. Yes, sir. Gentlemen, we have a job. Praise the lord. That's great, man. All right! I need some men to come in to town tonight and monitor the operations of certain bars and brothels. Brothels? Bars? Inspection, one hour. Operational supplies. One hour, gentlemen. That's not real booze is it? Oh man, he ain't that cool. I guess everybody says sorry sometimes. Even him. All right, guys. An hour ain't that long and we got a mission. Hey, far out about Holtz today. I thought he was gonna make it, man. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Yeah man, it's rough. That's why we need to get the lead out, aye? I ain't going, brother. We're all going, Lord. No, I ain't going in no pit of hell. Why not, man? It's a mission. You obviously didn't read that book I gave you. When he cometh again he shall smite all who frequent such places. That's not the point, man. We're a team. I don't like it all the time either, but we're a team and we gotta hang out together as a team if we're gonna keep ourselves alive. We do this, we're damned. Yeah, but if we don't, we're gonna be frustrated as hell. Sounds like beer all around, right boys? Except for one. Soda, Lord? Hey, that's right. Beers for everyone! You boys have fun. I'm going upstairs. Hey, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Look what we have here, Lord. Come on, baby. You can jump hoops. Jump some of this, man. Hey man, come on. Come on, Lord. Come on, baby. Hey, louder! Let's get the gold! Yeah, Lord, come on man. No, get back! Hey! Cool it! Go outside. We need to talk. I need to talk to you. All right, fuck him. Let's dance. Oh brother, how can I? Don't talk shit. I ain't no more your brother than the next stripper. What? You're gonna try and blow me away too, huh? No, I won't do that. You don't understand. She startled me, that girl. She startled me and I just overreacted, that's all. My mission here is to win the war by killing Gooks, not Americans, brother. Every god fearing American is my brother. Black, white. All. That's good. Because I don't wanna have to worry about you covering my ass. Relax. Relax. You pay for nothing? I wanted to leave my men alone to enjoy themselves. I had to bring someone. And, well, you're too young to be whoring. You oughta be home in the sack. Alone. I'm paying you to relax. And not try to kill me. You're a good Joe. Mine. Looks like a little G.I. You tell my boss we good, huh? And long fuck. Good fuck, okay? Okay. Hey, momma. Hey, guys. Look at what we got here. Some big tough special forces. That's right, babe. Very special forces. Hey, nigger. I bet while you was humping Aunt Margaret's bag, she thought that black stuff was combat camouflage. No sir, I swear I didn't. Cause she only sucks black dicks. * Jesus came to the VC way * Fighting and killing is getting me down * Tell the good slut don't fuck around * Rosello. Your sire wants you. This is it, Rosello. You don't have a paddle this time. You don't even have a damn rowboat. My men acted in self defense. Bullshit, Rosello. I got half the Marine Corps swear blind that you personally hit him them. I'll bust you for this, then I'll promote you so I can bust you again for conduct unbecoming. Well that's your right. You're damn right it is. As for your men, I'll have their asses in Leavenworth so fast they won't know what hit them. Those men have done a good job both times, sir. You wanna bust me, that's one thing! Leave them out of it! Are you telling me my job, Captain? Someone should, sir. You're confined to your quarters pending a hearing for court-martial. Why not here, sir? Because I don't want one of my officers sitting in jail. You'll have plenty of time after the court-martial. Then release my men also! They're your men too! They're going to be the best we do have! They stay, I stay. Fine Rosello. You stay with your men and rot, but rot you will. Prisoner dismissed. You bastard! Hey! What's happening? Where are you taking me? Help! Damn them. MVA overran the hospital. Roger that, sir. Check the map. Check the map. That puts the Gooks off Cambodia, sir. G-2 estimates company strength. Copy, sir. I'll put my men on it right away, sir. I got a squad that will track them down and give them hell. Roger, over and out. Rosello must've sold his soul to get this break. * How sweet * The sound * That saved * A wretch * Like me * Oh I * Was lost * But now * I'm found * T'was blind * But now * I see. Convey of MVA hit the hospital. Cabrini. - K.I.A. - - Dang it. They also got that NDA colonel before we could interrogate him. They grabbed the nurses. That colonel's now a security risk. We want him dead and we want the nurses back. Where were they headed? We'll have air reckon photos this afternoon. Go get your men ready. And Rosello, be careful out there. It's gonna be a tough one. Has been for a long time, sir. Gear up! Doesn't show much of Cambodia, Captain. What happens when we run out of map? We stop looking at it. The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Our father, who aren't in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Lord. Amen. Ah, shit. Lopez, Richter. Bag the body. Wilson. Jackson, track him. Let him be the rabbit. Moss, Richter, bury the dead. This is awful close to the border, sir. Radio. Arrow 15. Arrow 15. Calling quiver. Do you read me? Over. Come in. Come in, Arrow 15. Target on sight. Approximately two clicks away from Cambodian border. Over. Engage. Engage. You must attempt intercept before border. Over. Arrow 15, affirmative. Let's hit it! Charlie's way out ahead, Captain. He's gonna make it to Cambodia. Gentlemen, I can't give you a direct order to go in, but I'm gonna complete the mission. Border lines don't mean much to the NVA. Can't mean much to the Cambodians. Why should we worry? Army never cared much about what I wanted. Why should I give a shit about what they want? It's not gonna be easy. I don't know how many of you will be coming back. Green fields, Captain. Greener fields. The rest of you? Let's finish what we started, Captain. Captain, take point. I repeat, withdraw. Do not proceed. Over. I repeat, withdraw. Do not proceed. Over. Quiver, Arrow 15. Can not, repeat, can not read. Hope you can copy this. We'll require support, dawn sector six over Cambodia. I say again, sector six over Cambodia. Over. Oh boys. This is gonna be one tough motherfucker to crack. I need to get a closer look at the fort. If I'm not back in 10 minutes, get the hell out. What do you think? Should we follow him in? Yeah. Fuck man! Taken for sure. Shot me, man. Shoot me. Go on! Thank you. For what? For saving my life on the bridge. My men came back to save me. I'm sure yours will do the same. Just to kill you. If you have any regard for your life, you will stop them. I am indebted to you. You are safe for as long as I am alive. Rosello's been captured. Well, Sterling? You tell them, man. I already have. We're waiting for your orders. Hey guys, don't look at me. I don't know what to do. Don't you see, friend? The Lord has chose to give you this opportunity. Take it. I'm a cool dude because nothing rests on me. Right. Well, friend, you have a burden to bear. You're the last. We have no time. God willing, I'll pray for you tomorrow. Look, man, this time around, either you lead or Lord leads. Nothing personal, Lord. But it looks like I better do it. I know how you feel about night patrols, Bronski, but it's gotta be done. So good luck. Yes, sir. It's on, big guys. Arrow 15 signaling with coordinates, sir. They're well inside Cambodia. So it's risk choppers and crews inside Cambodia against orders or leave Rosello to it, huh? All right, any questions? Yeah, Heath's men. Did we get a response? Yeah, we got acknowledgement. All right, let's move it out. It'll be cool, Sterling. It'll be cool. Acknowledgement. Think that means they'll send the choppers? Well I guess we'll find out, won't we? It's up to you now. Go! Go! Hit the deck! Give me a mag. Choppers! Get down! It's ours! Let's go! Let's go! Air con! Readerman pulled through! Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers! Let's go! Come on! You'll be all right. Let's go! All right, man. This is it! Let's go! Get the fuck out of here, man. Sterling! Move it! Now, Captain. Come on! Come on! Okay, take her up! For all heroics we have seen, there's a common bottom line... Death. The dead have no victory. * Tell me what's it all about babe * Because my mind's turned into rust * Tell me what's it all about babe * When we're all turned into dust * There's no reason for the hating * Cause we all won't hate for long * There's no reason for the killing * Cause we'll all be dead and gone * Can't they see it's all a waste of time * Don't they get the costly joke * Can't they hear the gods are laughing * At all of us misguided folks * There's no reason for the crying * All our tears will soon run dry * For the children coming after us * We should at least give it a try * But until then what's it all about babe * Tell me because my mind's a bust * Tell me what's it all about babe * When we're all * Turning * Into * Dust
