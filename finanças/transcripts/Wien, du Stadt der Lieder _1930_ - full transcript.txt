You can't just come grouching in like that! Venerable ladies, adorable gentlemen... -Listen to me, everybody! -Ladies and gentlemen, I do suppose that I, as a true Viennese, have the right to introduce a true Viennese play... Here we go, "true Viennese", let me tell you, all Viennese are from Brünn. Is this so? Just because every Berliner is from Breslau? Well, I'm presenting to you a sound film farce... Venerable ladies and gentlemen, the words are from Ernst Neubach, -while Hans May... -...was the composer. -It's played by... -...the Dan Berlin orchestra. The actors: Ignaz Korn, instrument dealer, -played by Sigi Hofer. -The fat Hofer. You're no sylphide yourself! -His wife Emilie: -Dora Hrach. -Their daughter Steffi: -Charlotte Ander. -Wenzel Pokorny, master tailor: -That's me, Paul Morgan. Not that important. -Pepi Pokorny, his son: -Sym, Igo Sym. -Very well. Cäsar Grün, typesetter: -That's me, Max Ehrlich, in the flesh. How important... -Burgstaller, master butcher: -Max Hansen. -Ilona, saleswoman: -Irene Ambrus. -Piefke, traveler from Berlin: -Paule (Paul) Graetz. -Miss Bock, Cafetiere: -Grete Natzler. -Ferdinand, head waiter: -Siegfried Arno. -Gust, the piccolo: -Gustl Stark-Gstettenbaur. -Natzi -Rudolf Meinhardt-Jünger. -A nature singer: -Luigi Bernauer. -Sound recording: Tonbildsyndikat GmbH.

Stop this already, no one wants to know. Listen, what's that sound? Assistant tailor that you are! -That must be... -...Vienna! City of songs. ♫ You are my joy ♫ My love and joy Please mail the score to Opernring 3. -Will do. -See you, have a nice day. -Steffi! -Pepi! Pepi, beware, daddy can come in any moment now. Forget about daddy! I'd like the phonograph record called "Kissing Is No Sin". As you wish. ...damn it... the button... Ignaz, what's going on down there? -I'm looking for four-leaved clover. -Nonsense. Ah, there it is. -Where's Steffi? -At the store, where else would she be? What about my allowance? Here it is, one schilling. How stingy. Me? Stingy? You're so stingy, you peek over the lenses in order to preserve the glasses. You're gonna catch one on the nose one day. You there, out with you! -Herr Korn, let me explain... -Nothing to explain! Every time I come by I find you creeping around my daughter. Why are you not at your father's, the master tailor? We want to get married, Korn. My daughter won't marry an unemployed musician, Pokorny! -But daddy... -You be silent! You're marrying Burgstaller, and that's that! I'm not gonna marry any master butcher. Then you'll stay a virgin for all I care. Stop that. ♫ Oh how elusive are pork chops ♫ She likes the lean ones, he likes the fat ones Can you recommend the beef, Mr. Burgstaller? ♫ You shall never ask me ♫ One pound of young beef meat.

Goodbye, widow of the chief financial inspector, it was an honor! Goodbye... Hope to see you again... Kisses... Honor... Old goat! [speaks Polish (?)] Look at that! Terrible, look at that! [speaks Polish (?)] But this sounds so beautiful. Do your work! Very nice. Pepi, with your musical genius you could've been a student of Schiller's. Now, play something on the pliers. But father, one can't do that. One can't do that? Hurry now, take of your coat. Natzi, write it down! Always you want me to model for your customers. Of course, Pepi, you're handsome like Apollinaris of Belvedere. You see, with your genius and your ideal figure... -The front is small, 41 -41 ...you'll have to marry a millionaire. -Backside 43,5. -43,5. The woman who will get you must have at least... Strong stomach, very strong stomach. -...50.000! -What do you say, 50.000? -87, you moron. -87, you moron. 50.000 big ones. -But father, I'm in love with Steffi! -Steffi? Bollocks! Why Steffi? A girl with nothing to go for her. The hips are terrible. And no bust to speak of. Please come in, dear Mr. Cäsar Grün. Smells like... noodle soup, roasted goose... and coleslaw! Correct! But aren't you busy at your print shop until noon, Mr. Grün? I go there in the afternoon. -Take a seat, Mr. Grün. -Thank you. Are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Just a minute! No hurry, I'm coming! Disgusting person! -Ferdinand! -I'm on my way. This is how you care for my business! I just closed my eyes in order to reflect more thoroughly about the business. I'll make you open your eyes! -Ms. Bock! -Don't give me that amorous look! Better start working! Ms. Bock! Why so obstinate? ("bockig") Stupid person. Where's the piccolo? Where might he be? Where would we find him? Now where might he be? Hat... hatchet... How! Then he quietly crept closer. The knife was flashing, he raised his arm... ...and he seized... the scalp of the woman! Rascal! Out with you in the gardens! A pleasure, Ms. Bock! I'll make you move yet! Lazybones, all of you! -Isn't she beautiful? -A heavenly woman. Those eyes... She would fit right in with my tepee. Beat it, paleface! How! I've spoken! The little Winnetou. I beg your pardon, Ms. Korn. Am I allowed to act as if I'm at home? Of course you can, Mr. Grün. At home I eat like this, you know? Just marvellous! Marvellous! Tender goose meat. Tender... Just as tender as your own, Ms. Korn. Mr. Grün... Ms. Korn... I want... I would... I want... Just what is it that's on your mind, Mr. Grün?

If I catch you with my daughter again, you'll get it over the head with a piano! Unbelievable! Pokorny, Pokorny! -What do you want? -Your son has no business at my place. I might kill him! If you so much as touch him, I'll sue you! You can't even pay the lawyer! What was that? You're calling me an assistant tailor? Me, a bona fide master tailor you call an assistant? You destroyer of eardrums, you! One more word and I'll come over there! Bring it on! You'll get it with a hot iron! [Speaks Polish] ♫ Why are people fighting ♫ ??? ♫ People, beware! ♫ The clock just struck 12 ♫ Ilona, close the door ♫ I'm on my way to Korn Say hello to Steffi! Silly goose! A goat in love! My sweet kitty! I'm going out to eat, now. -Yes. -Close the shop and don't act stupid. See you, daddy. He's leaving just now. In one hour, there's going to be a lottery draw. An acquaintance needs money and wants to sell me his ticket. -I only got 3 schillings, though. -Is that so? Then we'll both chip in. Just a moment. There you have it. How do you do? It's almost dinner time. Shop's closed. Mr. Burgstaller's already left, too. Who cares for Burgstaller? I'll take a blood sausage. Quiet, old lad, quiet.

Gustl -Bring me the latest, the Polish one, too. -On my way. -Hello Ferdinand! -Hello! Here you go. -Hello Mr. Pokorny! -Hello. Ferdinand, for me one espresso, four pieces of sugar, two glasses of water, the noon paper, and a bit of Soda. That's all? I won't gorge myself for your sake! I'll read that at home. What can I bring you? Stupid question. The usual! Two glasses of water. Fresh water! A pleasure to have customers like you. Kitty, are we allowing him to marry Steffi? ...No!

Four pieces of sugar. Piccolo! Another two glasses of water! I'll get a water pipe for you. -Ferdinand! -What is it? Would you lend me 3 schillings? I'm not allowed to. I have a contract with the bank. I'm not allowed to lend money, and they aren't allowed to serve coffee. I've got a ticket. The draw is in the morning. In the afternoon you'll get 10 percent if I win. -Ticket number 10050. -Yes! -10 percent? -10 percent! Making money... -It's my honor... -Hello, Burgstaller. One espresso, got it? 10050... 10 percent... So who's paying this time? Mr. Pokorny pays! -One brandy for the priest. -Brandy... Ms. Bock, I'm crushed. If this happens again, you're fired! Don't you think you could get used to me? Bah! Beat it! There it is, go on. Say nothing, I know, I know. Contra! Contra to you! Mister souffleur, keep your mouth shut! Sub-Contra! Tutti! Stag! -What do you want? -You have to play Tarok (?)! Are those cards mine or yours? Your cards. Say, is this your coffee or my coffee? Your coffee. Why're you always drinking my coffee? The other gentlemen unfortunately didn't order coffee. One moment, I'm playing. ♫ Heart... heart, my heart... -♫ A heart, that is... -I got a heart right here. ♫ And a heart... Why are you blowing smoke into my face? Where else? -Morning! -I'm honored. Say, bewitching being, can you get me old Korn? (Korn = corn schnapps) -What's that? Please ask my staff. -Thanks, duchess. Come here, little Viennese titlark! -Honored. -Say, little tray juggler, Can you get me old Korn? I can get you Slivovitz. No no no, even with a thousand words of Viennese that won't do. Ah, over there I see him, the old alligator with his fangs. At him with a roar! He's a foreigner! And now... Ultimo!... Nothing more to say! -Mr. Korn! -What's that? Nothing more to say. [Goes off with "Berlinese" mumbojambo] Stop that doe-eyed stare, don't you know who I am? Don't you know about P.P.? Paul Piefke, Berlin? Company Turn and... Phonograph... kitchen... household... Allow me? Piefke, Piefke, Piefke! If he says "Piefke" one more time, I'll have to start swimming. My friend, with us, it's bubbles from the front, from the back, from all around. Nice of you to make room for me at your table. Viennese congeniality, that's what I like. A charming group of nice young Viennese folk. Vienna, city of my dreams, I'm longing for Vienna. Three months before travelling here I'm dreaming of things to put in this bag. [drifting into nonsense] Driving alongside the road, of course, a pub. In turns I'll bring you the newest jokes, the latest songs. Listen to this, this is something, a hit! "You hear this in every house / everyone is singing this" "At the front it looks like we're solvent / At the back we're broke, though" Korn, if you have this record, you won't be able to hold on to it, customers will grope this from your hands. Last week I strained my thump, because the customers ripped it from my fingers. What a business! You can by a castle, just with the interest from the sales! That's just what I want, Korn, you with your funny head... baroque... digging in the pillows... Come here, a little order, 1000 units. Hurry, sign here, down here, talk talk, write write. -Ferdinand? -Yes? Another customer, please. See, these guys are already fed up with you. What do you want? You're right, there's something I do want, bring me something fresh, something wet. What am I saying, get me a coffee. -With cream? -I get the coffee, this one gets creamed. Or let's say... better get me a white one with a shot. With a shot? This is not a gun shop, but a coffee house. Funny bug! Guys, let me tell you... that's what I call furor teutonicus. (German rage) Gentlemen, I'll have to be at the printery soon. Will the game continue or not? See you later. Stop! I smell a rat! No one leaves the room! I was hiding a second king of spades in my pocket and now he's gone. A fine company you are. Cheater! (fighting continues) Just like in Berlin's city parliament. That's a hoot! Enough with your foreign manner of speaking. I'll slap you left and right! You'll get your slappings wholesale! Nobody that you are! You're calling me a nobody? What a pigsty! Never in my life have I seen something like this. Junk-rubbish, all of you! How could you... What are you calling us? You there! I'll show you what a master butcher... This is exactly how I always imagined Viennese congeniality. A nice coffee house I've chosen to work at. The ultimate in insolance! Occupied! Mr. Burgstaller, you seem to have lost something. You got the exact same ticket as Mr. Korn? Number 10050. -Interesting... -Hand it over already. -Ferdinand! -Patience, please. I'm hurrying already. For heaven's sake. Godda... The telephone must've been invented in old testament times. The bible says: "At mount Sinai, Moses called on god three times, without a reply." My... Oh... Hello? Miss... 42-12... C. Wolf... Yes... yes... Say what? I have to pay? Tell me something new. One moment, please! Miss, I'm out of change. Maybe you'll lend it to me? Pardon me? I'm paying, just a moment! I'm paying! You'll see. -Hello? -How do you do? Cäsar Grün speaking. You're calling on me, bad boy? I just wanted to ask you, magnificent woman, what you'll serve for dinner at your place tonight. Mr. Grün's talking to a woman. Some woman she has to be. Talking to someone like him. One moment, please. Hurry up! So I'll be coming up when your husband, the fool, ain't at home. What a fool this husband has to be. A fool indeed! See ya! -Mr. Grün. -Go on. You'll typeset the winning lottery numbers for the evening paper, won't you? Both Burgstaller and Korn have bought ticket number 10050. Please call on me if this is a winner. -10050. -Yes, 10050. Will do. I'm coming. What a hassle. Korn, I got to tell you... Steffi doesn't care for me. You're going to marry my daughter. Excuse me, gentlemen, what's going on? Did you see that? What insolence! He just slapped me! Would you dare doing the same? I insist. Have a good day. A ruffian, he is. Do we have the winning ticket yet? Yes, number 10005. 10005? WINNING TICKET OF TODAY'S LOTTERY: NUMBER 10005. I've got an idea. Finally, dinner! (grumbling) Where's your husband? Grün! What's going on there? "Winning ticket for the main prize is number 10050." Heavens! That's it, that's it! 10050! Emilie, we just won 100.000 schillings. We're millionaires! Millionaire! Ignaz! Ignaz, get rid of the furniture. We're too good for them now. You can order new ones from the Hofburg. Come with me! See you! See you! With the greatest disdain... Hello... hello? Ha... ha... Miss, please give me 22644. No, I said 22 6 4... Not 97 83. 2... or tell me which number I have to say if I want 22644. Is this Cafe Bock? Yes, Cafe Bock? Ferd... Oh, you're Ferdinand! Ferdinand, this is Grün... Grün! "G" as in gasworks. No, not Grey! Grün! (green) Finally... I'm calling because of the ticket number. Ticket number 10050 wins the main prize of 500.000 schillings. Sorry? Hello? Hello? He seems to have gone crazy with joy. What's going on? Why are you dancing? Are you crazy? You dare to smoke in here? -But Ferdinand! -Yippie! No more Ferdinand-ing! What do you mean? Korn and me just won half a million in the lottery! Today, we'll be at the pub. You're invited, pretty lady! My respects, Mister Von Ferdinand, most esteemed Mister Von Ferdinand! You're invited too, rascal! What is this? Has he lost his mind? (singing in Polish) Steffi, Steffi! Listen to your only father! Steffi! -Steffi, you know Rothschild? -No! I'm Rothschild the second, I won the main prize! We'll get new furniture, you'll get a new mother... No, the old one will do. Gosh, the main prize... Pepi! Pepi! Pepi! Pepi! What's going on? Why the rush? Pepi! My father won the main prize! -We'll get married! -My dear Steffi! That's what I've always said. Those Korns are decent folk! ♫ In a little grand slaughterhouse ♫ I won the lottery in May Mister Grün, here, take these two pieces of ham! -Thank you. -You're welcome. And you, Ilona, you can have the shop! Oh my god, Burgstaller, thank you! You're more than welcome! Hello? Hello! Miss? Yes? 55-55! Yes... yes... Hello, whom am I speaking to? Is this the car dealership "Ex and Haust"? Mister Exhaust in person! Just imagine whom you're speaking to. Millionaire Burgstaller. Yes, single-handedly... Won't you send me one of those things... A big one, an open one... A Packard, yes, yes... What's the prize-tag? 40.000? That's not expensive. Not expensive at all. A Packard-Elle... So please just send it over, will you? Sonnengasse 4, ground floor. Have a nice day! Guys, they're giving away those cars for free! Heaven help, he's become megalomaniacal! ♫ Car, move, move, move to my green side ♫ I like you way too much, I estee-ee-eem you ♫ Car, move, move, move to my green side That money's going to his head! I'll take that back. This is my shop, get lost! Ha! You've been bugging me long enough! Beware, beware... Caution! -...this was payed for... -...antique furniture... This must've been expensive. Yes, over there. What do you think about the new decors? Wonderful, I... You're always in the way! I don't get it. ...Beautiful... The Kaiser had his breakfast, right here... Wonderful, marvellous! Watch out! We're millionaires now! -You're getting payed for it. -Second that. Marvellous, exorbitant! ♫ We're driving out to Knusberg today ??? Listen... We've all invited to the pub by that stupid winner. Ferdinand said he needed his suit for that. I've only done the hips so far, though. I'm no magician! Don't talk back, oaf! He told me he needs the suit, hips or no hips. -So take care of this. -Nothing doing. ♫ We're driving out to Knusberg today Look where you're going! Unbelievable! Turn this off! Hello! Hi there, Burgstaller! Korn speaking. What? Where to? To the... Stupid fellow! Stupid man! So stupid... Pardon me. Not you, not you! That guy, that furniture mover... So where to? To the pub, all right! Steffi will be there to, of course. What do you have? A new Packard? A Packard, you say! Impostor! One moment, the Packard, the furniture Packard (furniture packer) is here. That's stupid. Alright, we'll be down there in five minutes. See you, Burgstaller, see you! Emilie, Emilie, we're going to the pub. Steffi, get yourself ready! Not without Pepi! Then invite him, why don't you. She'll marry Burgstaller in the end. Anyway, I'll get dressed. ♫ Because I... Well, quite the car, isn't it? Did you pay off the rates? Don't get smart. Foolish fool, a fooly one you are. ??? -Enter! -I will! Let's drive! We'll pick up the others. -Go on! -What do you mean, go on. Now you'll witness a millionaire driving! ♫ ???

Shut up! -He needs to shut up! -You shut up! -Is this what you call love? -What about your love? -Goddamn it! -Here we go again... I'm fed up with you, you rascal! -Say that again! -Rascal!

A shame you're from Berlin! -Can I take your coat? -Oh no, thanks! My steam heating's frozen over.

(Viennese slang) You're downright "tulli" (Viennese slang) (with fake Viennese intonation) ♫ No one can mess with you, because ♫ You speak your mind ♫ No one can mess with you, because your hearts are at the right place ♫ Your shell might be hard, but you got a soft heart ♫ Why fight? Vienna and Berlin, we like each other! Hi there! There's a table ready over there. Say, who's that sitting there? They're English and french. -Let's go, my friends! -Let's go!

See, I know another Steffi... -I like her very much. -Why so glum while talking about her? Sadly? No... Does she know? Of course! I told her. How did you tell her? How did I? Simply like that: ♫ Girl, if you have a heart ♫ You got to feel my burning ♫ Girl, my heart is breaking ♫ When thinking about someone else stealing you away from me And then, I also told her this: ♫ I can't live without you, marvellous girl ♫ Life has no purpose without you ♫ Come with me to a remote small town ♫ Pack your bags, we're leaving today ♫ I'd like us to go to a cottage, listen to my pleadings, come with me ♫ Because I can't live without you, marvellous girl ♫ My life has no meaning, if we're not leaving together This still isn't all. I also told her: ♫ Since meeting you I have no peace of mind ♫ Everybody knows what I'm talking about, I'm struck with the love germ ♫ I can't live without you, marvellous girl ♫ Life has no purpose without you ♫ Come with me to a remote small town ♫ Pack your bags, we're leaving right now ♫ I'd like us to go to a cottage, listen to my pleadings, come with me ♫ Because I can't live without you, marvellous girl ♫ Come with me, we're leaving tonight Ferdinand, marvellous! Burgstaller, come here! Oh, so pleasant! Feels like royalty. The pillow is nice, too. ♫ Vienna, city of songs ♫ Vienna... Hey there! Didn't you notice? It's eight in the morning! Huh! Time to get at home to get up! See you soon! What a rascal, I can't believe it! What's that? It's eight already? Holy smoke! We didn't win the main prize! They printed the wrong number! I know. I already returned the new car. We're poor folks again. Speak for yourself. I'm not poor, I own the store now. What are you saying? You gave it to me as a gift yesterday. I've got witnesses. Christ! God in Heaven! Might become your shop again... You've got all the options... No thanks, I'll marry Steffi! ♫ I've got a car, I've got a castle ♫ The coffee is especially good today, too Listen! Listen! -A tragedy! -What happened? See here, listen to this. They printed the wrong number. The main prize isn't 10050, but 10005. Heavens! We're broke! All that nice furniture! -Steffi! -Pepi! Oh Pepi, to hold you in my arms again! We won 20.000 schillings, the two of us! -The two of us? -20.000! Well, still hung over? Millionaire that you are. Shut the fuck up. What a clown... -Hello, Ms. Bock. -Hello. I... wanted to ask if you're looking for a waiter. Is there anything else you want to tell me? Yes... ♫ I can't live without you ♫ Marvellous girl Life has no purpose without you. I'm sorry, but we're not looking for a waiter anymore. Oh... nothing doing, then. Goodbye, Ms. Bock. Goodbye, Mr. Ferdinand. -Ferdinand! -Ms. Bock? There's an opening for a position as head waiter, though. Ms. Bock... Yippie! -Ferdinand! -Ms. Bock... Ms. Bock... -Ferdinand! -What's the rush. Good morning. Steffi? Where's my sweet Steffi? Steffi... Steffi! Oh, Mr. Burgstaller! Why so gloomy? I... I just wanted to give my best wishes. Thank you! Yes, we'll get married. Burgstaller, wait here a minute, won't you, I'll return with Pepi in a moment. Come with me, Pepi! ♫ I can't live without you, marvellous girl ♫ Life has no purpose without you ♫ Without you... What's going on with you, Burgstaller? Nothing, and that's the problem. I know... You're in love! You know, don't take it so hard. Women aren't worth it. And what do you know about that? Well... I've paid my dues. I was in love, too. But then I said to myself: "Gustl", I said, "those few kisses aren't worth driving yourself crazy over." You've got a point, Gustl. You can't always get what you want in life. That's the spirit, Burgstaller! Cheer up! Be a man, like me! Oh, I almost forgot, you're wanted in the coffee house, the guys just threw out Grün. I'll be there, Gustl. Believe me, Burgstaller, women are the root of all evil. Ilona! I'm leaving, Mr. Burgstaller. I just wanted to tell you, the business about the store... ...that was just a joke. Farewell, Mr. Burgstaller. Just think of Ilona once in a while. But Ilona, you won't leave now of all times. See, my store always was your store, too. And... it would be so great if you could stay. In _our_ store... Well? ♫ Vienna, city of songs ♫ You're reconciling us again ♫ Whatever may be ♫ Whatever fate has in store for us ♫ Everything works out in the end ♫ Everything works out in the end Subtitles by: pedrosliger
