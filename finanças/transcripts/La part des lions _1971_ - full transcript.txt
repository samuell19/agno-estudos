Is it for the prize? Park in front of the door. Please calm down. Ladies and gentlemen.... After due deliberation, our jury has unanimously awarded... ...the Honore de Balzac Prize for 1971... ...to Mr Eric Chambon... ...for his book "Children of War". By how many votes? Wait for me here, don't move. So? Who got the prize? You know? No? Okay. - Who got the prize? - Eric Chambon. Chambon. - Is this his first book? - No. He doesn't know his book has been published. Where does he come from? Who is Eric Chambon? I refuse this pasted label. It was you who stuck it up. I gave you a manuscript, an amateur manuscript. Here I am bombarded with the "Balzac 1971". Only, in 20 years, I'll still be "Balzac 1971". My book competed without my consent. You knew I was against it. I admit, this manuscript would never have left my drawer. Now I can't stop this damn book from existing. I refuse the prize. By refusing you give us much more publicity. Personally, your attitude pleases me. It adds 2 or 3 zeros to the staggering print-run. If it was anyone other than you, I'd suspect it was a set-up. Suspect and say what you want. I refuse, so take advantage of it. I'm tired of the whole thing, But Eric, let's look at... It's him. Mr. Chambon, please. - What do I tell them? - That I'm at the hospice. Eric? Why did you come? Why not? They told you to come? - No. - Oh yes. It's just that I must be getting close to the exit door. What are you getting at? I just wanted to see you. I think of you a lot, you know. And about us... About all that happened over the years. Well, that's all I ever think about. It was during the dark years, that I really lived. Since then... ...I've been dead for a long time. But here, they don't know. No need to tell them. You were great when my parents were taken. I didn't understand very well. It happened without violence. It all seemed natural. I was sure she'd come back with her groceries and her ration cards. You were 12 years old. 11. Oh yes. It was Maurice, who was 12 years old. He also had his parents taken from him. The winter before. I was already an old bachelor at the time. And I found myself with two children. I remember... clandestine radio... ...personal messages... Your code-name was…? "Monsieur Beau Fixe." "Monsieur Tout va bien". English... ...from the last parachute drop. They warned you too. Warned of what? It's time to go to bed now. It's is good. Time for bed. - No. I want to watch television. - Come on. See you soon. No, don't come back... Ever. THE LIONS' SHARE I'm over there. Have you come here often? Often enough. - We've never met. - It's true. Are you... You're managing well? I'm not complaining. - Well, I'm... - I know. Can I give you a lift? No thanks. I have to leave you. Bye. Bye. - Busy night tonight. - Not bad. - Good night ma'am. - Good night, Julian. See you tomorrow. Well, hello. - There's something wrong. - No, it's fine. Eventually you'll tell me. I saw an old friend. He was like my brother, when we were kids. And...? It's no longer possible. I've changed too much. Don't think about it anymore. I think about it. So tell me about him. Tell me everything. You'll feel better. No. If your life and his life, are now totally different... ...there's nothing you can do about it, is there? - Is it really all that serious? - I don't know. You never come when things are going well. It's true that I'm a bit of a pain for you. I'm not complaining. I went to your place before coming here. You should've waited for me. But don't let it bother you. Your meeting with this guy was a coincidence. You won't see him again. No. No. He didn't want flowers. Sir, they're included in our 1st class package. Get rid of them. Gentlemen... I warn you... there can't be any refund. "The dead, the poor dead... "are in great pain..." Oh, that's enough! But, sir, it's from Baudelaire... ...and it is also included in the package. I don't want complaints getting back to my boss. I've already taken the wreaths back. You were a hero. A hero of the shadow war. Today you are here in peace. But, as a great thinker, who you surely admired, said... Isn't war a form of peace? The old man would have let him speak so that he doesn't lose his place. At a time when men were divided... ...you knew how to reconcile them. At a time when France... Shall we take breakfast together? It's not possible. So we'll take a drink. It's done for funerals... People celebrate still being alive. - I'm not free. - Going back to Paris? Bye. On this still-open grave... Hey there! Where are you going? - And what are you doing here? - This is where I live. Well well. See this cabin... I made it with my own hands. With your hands maybe, but with the blue bedroom door. If you recognize the door... ...you should know that the municipality don't want this house. Since when? Ever since it was abandoned. It would cost as much to demolish as to rebuild. It hasn't been sold has it? You're not going to claim it? You never know. He didn't come back. Mr Reviront is not coming back now. He's dead. Go and look at it, if you like it. Free entry for everyone. Rain, drafts, lost cats... And anything that's lost. Go ahead...! You will be in good company. Eric. You came too? Yes. I don't have a table. - Looking at my finger? - You still mad at me? You were more gifted for literature than for traps. Have a chair. Put that there. It's cold. I got lost in all those stairs. - I know. Going out, it will be the same. - Here's the note. bill - Keep the change. - Thanks. It's not terrible. It’s actually pretty gross. So, you haven't been here long? Nearly 3 years. You must be dying of cold in winter. - There are no radiators. - Not noticeable. This is the new thermal surface heater. The last word in functional architecture and stupidity. I wouldn't have got the order for a shack like that. I like Louis XV style. It's unforgiving. Their heating is perfect, but it never works. You'll understand. On paper, it always makes sense. You know those indoor fireplaces that a man could stand in? Well, the air doesn't flow. Because to flow on, it should… I don't know. It'd take a thingummy. And this thingummy was not invented. That's progress. It's a friend... Maurice. - I don't put myself out for everyone. - I'm not everyone. That's good? I know you. You followed me once. Correct. I shook you off at the Trinity. So then you went back to Clichy. Except I was following you. Why? I wouldn't have had you working with someone other than me. I wanted to be sure. It's so hard to work alone... Frankly, I didn't think you could. I don't like being accountable. Sound. Very sound. You're well housed. Congratulations. Nothing that ties you. Have you never wanted to keep... ...a beautiful canvas, a beautiful object? Never. You only steal for the money. Not even that. Are you happy? I've chosen what I do. In our business, when you're fed up... ...it's always because you got attached to something. When a man is tied down, he can rot. I'm listening. A big hit, Maurice. A million for you. And for you? I have fees. Why me? There's a safe. You're the best. I see. It would please me, Maurice. - You're not mad at me? - No. Why? I want some time to think. I do that better alone. I need to know quickly. You will. You understood… what I do? Understood and forgot. Only... a million...! That's a few council flats. It's not that. Why didn't you grab it? Safes and me, you know... I don't have the spark. I have to say... I think I've lost my touch. We’ll just have to wait. He's going to refuse. Why do you say that? I can't say for sure. Just an impression. You got an impression? Yes. Do you think Maurice could be a has-been? There is that. If not, why does he want to be alone? The approval of friends is worth a lot. Why would he be different? He's okay, you'll see. Are you expecting anyone? It's you I'm waiting for. Is there another? Yes. You. I don't count. You do, when you're there. And when I'm not there? I have my life. I don't even know your address. You don't need it. It's weird. We're so distant fro each other. If I were in your place… You're not in my place. Either way, we can't choose. That's true. This guy's a fanatic about files, too. Grazzi Michel Criminal Brigade Inspector Cases solved... Nice track record. You and your files... I like to know the face of the guys that I risk having behind my back. They have their files, I have mine. Hello? It's Maurice. He's in with us. I wouldn't have believed it. I'm very happy. I'm very happy. You should hang up. That can always be rebuilt. With this expense, you could buy yourself a new villa. Yes I know. But I want this house exactly as it was before. When can you start? Are you in a hurry? Just start as soon as you can. In 8 days. 8 days? Perfect. I'll have to clear this whole area. - For when I bring in the materials. - Good. OK. Bastard! Vandal! Savage! Cataclysm! Yes, cataclysm! Maurice needs to know where the safes are, the model... ...and how many employees are around. Other than that, Maurice does everything. Do you know how to open safes? - It's not just Maurice. - Yes, it is! And it's me who wants this information. I have the right, don't I? For you. - I'm going. - Yes. We have up to 100 kilos of platinum in this safe. But we don't keep it constantly... ...just 5 days a month. ...the time that specialists use it for... 20 kilos a day. So your safe is interesting 5 days per month. We don't think about it that way. There are others who may. But nothing's ever happened. That can change. Who do you suspect? - Not our workers, I'm sure. - No but... I have information. In the police, we work with our ears, and not just our own. And what are you planning to do? Nothing or almost nothing... Some presence. You? Not me. Sir, you need 2 bookkeepers. Me? No. Yes. Besides, they're here. Come in. Two men of mine. I'm lending them to you. - From.…? - Cops. You can tell, it doesn't bother them anymore. Give them accounting to do. Have no fear, they understand nothing about it. Here you are... While you're here, this office is yours. Do you think this is at all useful? As you come from higher education and work in aeronautics... ...you probably don't appreciate down-to-earth methods. Work well, guys. Study and Application Center special alloys - Let him in. - What's happening? It's a strike. Come in if you want, but you stay. You freaking out? No, boss. The strike just broke out like that, suddenly. We didn't talk to the workers so they didn't talk to us either. We knew nothing about it. A delegate arrived, and now the factory is sealed off. Yes, I can see. - What are your orders? - Return to HQ. They won't try anything today. - We can't, we're locked in! - How can't you? You're not going to tell me my officers are afraid? Just escape! Sir... nothing can happen, the factory's on strike. Strike? Yes. For 50 francs increase per month. For their 50 increase, we're losing heaps. I find it funny. Not when I'm out of pocket. The platinum wasn't there yet. With Maurice, it was there. Now you'll have to find something else. I don't like doing nothing. Yes. I've always liked work. Mr Chambon, there's a letter for you. Thanks. Mr Chambon. Dear Mr Chambon, I was expecting you. Follow me. We'll see your new acquisition. This place has always the same effect on our customers... ...on their first visit. Please come in. - Impressive, isn't it? - I'll say. It's still a welcoming place. We leave our customers alone in this room... ...to attend to their business. - Are You lock them up? - Yes. - You'll lock me up too? - For your safety. But today is different. I'll show you around. You see this button near the door? So we can come and set you free. You'll get used to it quickly. But let's see the safety deposit box first of all. The 357. - How many do you have? - 750. And they're expensive. - Do you have several rooms? - No, just one. You interested in this door in front? This one. It's the door to the room of the bank vault. And this one? The guard's room. He stays there all day, and we pick him up in the evening. That camera allows him to monitor the hallway... ...on a screen, for potential visitors. There's also another camera at the top, at the entrance... ...right in front of the door. - So the guard has it all covered. - Exactly. He saw you go into the bank... ...just as he sees us now in this hallway. We're on TV. In the series "Dramas and Enigmas". The only house built by Eric Chambon, architect. Here, put your fingerprints on it. It's funny. That job... you didn't want to do it. And now that it fell through, you look disappointed. Things may not always work as we'd like. There are things you have to have a feeling about. This time it didn't work for bullshit reasons. - Next time… - Next time it will work. If you want it. Me, I write. It means I do some hard thinking. So what? I've imagined a heist to pull off. You? - You'll say I'm nuts. - Tell me. I think it's as good as anything your friends could dream up. Go on. It'd be a coup for both of us... ...like before, remember, when we were playing scared. Tell me about it. Come and look. Hands up! - You, with others. - Close the door. Move! Come on. Come on. Come on! Move to the right. Everyone on the floor. Quickly! - Come on. Come on, open it. - No. Open up, I tell you. And don't try any tricks. Open for me. The camera upstairs went haywire. Open. Obey or you die. Do as he says. If you give us the combination, it will go faster. My boyfriend didn't plan that there'd be so much. Come on, let's close. Not bad, the idea to mess up the cameras with our 2 corpses. Really great. Not me, my buddy. He imagined how to scare without doing any damage. Oh sorry. There is damage. Take a look at my dress and his suit. Your suit, my poor darling. We must burn everything, Maurice. Even yours. To a friend. You're entitled to your share. Me, I didn't do anything. Let's say… author's rights. Your idea was great. - Any other bright ideas? - For what? There's a jewelry store, not far from your bank. I said to myself that you'd arrange a visit for us... ...and that you'd see everything from your window, as before... Front row seats. I'll think about it. I take it as a compliment. It's not. When I work for Marcati, he's the one who thinks for me. He thinks the way I do. Not this time. Too bad. Do you understand that? - May I? - Go ahead. Your second nature... A kilo of metal. Fuck you. Here... I'll get you dressed again. Habits don't change in your profession. It's all about your hardware. Listen to me carefully. You don't think the same as me, or as much. When you shoot people, you make them bleed for good. But with 10 guys like me, 10 of us... ...to be found in every university... ...guy like you will be out of work. Not if I can shoot 10 times. So you'll have to aim for the head. That I know how to do. Oh, Daniel. Daniel! Come on, we're rich. You are rich. Everything worked as expected. Everything? - And the photographer? - I broke his camera. You saw me. You're good with that? No, it's not good with him. We must leave nothing behind. That's all! Enough of this talk. I spoke because I know how to keep quiet. I have an idea, for the photographer. Again? After all, that's my only false note. Perfect. You never take sides. You always agree. I only have one boss. Miss, don't move. Just 30 seconds and you'll have a photo. I've got my own. Miss, be nice. Come on, let's see... No. I want to do another one. This one failed. I know the trick. You didn't take a picture. You pretend to take a picture and then say it failed. Did the Polaroid trick work? I said that I'd changed camera because the other was broken. Did you say you had the photos? No. I repeated what you told me. I haven't cleaned up, Mr Paul. You didn't leave the keys. It doesn't matter. Go in and shut up or I'll kill you. Paul, is that you? Paul? You'll carry her to the bed. You're going to tie her up, you're going to gag her. Maurice. Sit there. You see, I take photos too. Talk. I'm really a very dangerous guy, you know. I... I succeeded in taking this photo yesterday. I was hoping to sell it to the newspapers... ...and then the cops jumped on me. I don't have a permit... So they used that. I was scared and told them what I'd seen. And then? This morning, they were watching me. If anyone asked me about yesterday, I had to say I hadn't been able to take any photos. That's what you said to the guy that you saw before Grazzi? Yes. - Did you know him? - No. Is that all? Yes. And you told it all to Grazzi, in the bar? Yes. Philip? What do you have to say to him? It's you? So much the better. I'm at the photo guy's. He took lots of pictures yesterday. The cops figured we'd want to get them back. So what? Your little friend who thinks he's a hotshot, tried. Result... The cops spotted him and are onto him. He won't talk. I don't want to give him the chance. Forget it. That's an order. I don't work in a novel. I value my skin. And I deal with my interests in my own way. Listen... I'm going to call some pals, in Nice. Since yesterday, 10 people will have seen me there. I will have been seen with you, as well. Don't go, Maurice. Your boyfriend can give us all away. Not him. I'm your friend too, Maurice. I'm telling you, don't go. It won't change anything. It's possible. You are alone? Yes. Go stand by the window. The cops are watching you. Go to the window. No... He's alone. He's sitting down. Nothing unusual? No. I'll wait till tonight to get him out. You can go now. You're going to take him in your car? Yes. I'll wait. The cops will see you leave. They'll be sure to follow you. Good... Well, here I go. I don't congratulate you, Grazzi. If anyone needed protecting, it was that guy and that girl. Alright, but I thought... Stop thinking. Your assumption is absurd. That heist with the fake corpses, was not a crook's idea. Crooks are becoming intellectuals, dear boy. There are even some who write their memoirs. No more bars in Pigalle... long live the literary cafes. Eric Chambon's book pays a lot. So he was going to rob a bank? - And yet… - Nevertheless? This is what I discovered. Menard and Chambon, 2 inseparable friends... ...raised by an old bachelor during the Occupation. The old man was in the Resistance, the two kids tried it too... It leaves its mark. The old man died last month. There was only Maurice and Eric at the funeral. I know it sounds silly... ...but it's Maurice Menard's hand. Maurice Menard doesn't mix with that crowd. No woman... A guy like him, who takes big risks on his own... It's not normal to start working with a gang. He must be doing it for someone. For Chambon, of course. As Chambon couldn't lead him towards literature... Menard taught him about heists. Make sense? As the friendship is my only lead, we'll see. Alright, I'll give you... 48 hours, I know. So here you are... Have you been here long? - It's not me. - That, I know. You could've helped yourself to a drink. There's nothing you like. I'll make you a coffee. Did you keep it? Of course, I kept it. I break a lot of them, but I've managed to save this one. Annie… Yes? You won't see me for a while. I'm used to it. It will be longer than usual. Don't try to find out, you'd get spotted. I don't care. Will you ever come back? - Is that the guy with the flowers? - I don't know. When you’re here, there’s nobody. You will come back? Good. Say nothing. I understand. I expect too much of you. I'll be here. Say goodbye to me. But I'm staying. I'd rather you say it now. Say goodbye to me. Goodbye. Goodbye. There you are. - What name? - Grazzi. Two Z's? Please make it to "Inspector Grazzi"... - Inspector of…? - Of that, yes. - That's not very nice. - It will bring you luck. - At the moment, I'm very lucky. - Oh yes? I'm investigating the armed robbery in your neighborhood. The bank opposite you. And...? I'll nick everyone involved. Really? We know their hideout. We just close the area and pick them up. Good. Case closed... I'll have time to read. Don't work too hard. No danger, I'm Corsican. I'm stopping. It worked fine. I fixed it under the mudguard. Perfect. Grazzi here, listen to me. Normal tailing in Paris. We'll take turns, because he's suspicious. As soon as we leave Paris, we follow it on the radar. Okay? Out. Get going. You have to go, Maurice. So you make yourself forgotten. You risk too much here. They'd eventually get you. As soon as the fence has paid us, I send you your share. With all the merchandise, that's going to take time. Tell me... Have you told Eric you're going to leave? No, he doesn't know anything. Daniel was your problem, not mine. I would've split with him, anyway. Maurice, just between ourselves... ...with Jacques, too. He's a good guy. No beef about Daniel. He understands. Getting thin. I've lost a lot of weight. What's happening? Grazzi knows you're here. He's had the area blocked off. They didn't follow me I paid attention. So what's that? They followed you. Attention! You're surrounded. You don't stand a chance. Go up. I want all roads closed. I mean all of them! You OK? Don't have any illusions... we'll run into them. You choose your friends badly, Maurice. You hear me? He was taken in as a kid. - How are you? - Okay... Here they are. We'll catch them. They're catching up with us. There's a crossroads... They'd be expecting us there. Yes, well I'm not an altar boy. That mad car again! - What are you doing? - We'll wait here. I'll patch you up. I'll park the car. I'm telling you, I haven't seen them. We're certain they couldn't get out of the village. They must be hiding around here. You don't have an idea? An idea? It's up to you. There is not some property, a hidden track, a hut? Well, all that... I don't give a damn. Me neither. Why do you say that? You think I don't care? No way. You don't care I don't care. - Neither of us care. - All right! Hey, a Byrrh. You'll come out on top like a boss. We'll be back on the road tonight. I know a hideout. - I'm not a bastard. - Who calls you a bastard? Someone. They went that way? You can't get anything out of these peasants. - What did you say? - Me? Nothing. Pardon me, you called me a peasant! Forget it. There's more under my cap than under your kepi. Good for you. Good for me, too bad for you. You can't guess the simplest things. Things that I know and that I keep to myself... ...because I'm not a bastard. What do you know? Me? I didn't say that. You did... I heard. What do you know the cops don't know? I said it for a joke. We're not here for jokes. Come on! You'll come with us and you'll show us the way. My bike! My bike! My bike! Get this jerk out of the way. Get out of the way! - Get going! - I have to work. Don't argue... do as I say! Come on! Now you're completely surrounded. I know, I seem to repeat myself... ...but you no longer have any chance at all. Throw down your weapons... ...and come out with your arms in the air. We have all the time in the world... But we know that you're exhausted. Marcati is injured. Dead, maybe. Your accomplice, Jacques Darret, is dead. Before dying, he spoke. We know that Maurice Menard is with you... ...because Eric Chambon spoke, too. Attention... You're finished. You no longer have a chance. Stop! Where you are going? We have to level the ground for house building work. - I'll modify your work. - What? Let go of me! We're not here to do your dirty work. Jean! Jean! Jump now. Jump! - Jump! - Jean, don't jump! John, don't jump! Come on, get him out. Hey, Marcati shot himself. And Maurice? He is dead. And you... you'll be fine. And this is just the beginning. Ah, the vandals! What did they do to my house? My poor house.. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
