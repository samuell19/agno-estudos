'Studying the autopsy report... Carried out by the chief medical officer... Analysis of the fingerprints found on the glass... Excessive levels of alcohol in the blood... And the door being locked from the inside...' Why didn't you tell us you were coming'? Marco, your guardian, wouldn't have left. But I sent a telegram. You must have written the wrong address. I waited for two hours at the airport, then I took a taxi. You're the daughter of her second husband. Perhaps I'm a little brazen, you must forgive me... But I don't know you? You're right. I'm asking you all these questions and I haven't introduced myself. You see... I was your mother's best friend... I've been living here since she let me use the basement for my studio. I understand. Tell me, what happened to my mother... It was horrible. Shocking. Let's not talk about it now. This was Dorothy's room. You loved your mother. I must have seen her only ten times in my life. I spent my life in boarding school. I don't remember her. She was very beautiful. You called. Where are all the photos of Dorothy? I don't know... I have no idea. But they've disappeared. Perhaps it was the police, when they came. It doesn't matter. There should be a photo of you taken a few years ago. Do you like it? Dorothy was a very elegant lady. She often wore this. It was a present from Marco. Why, a Mini. Come on, get undressed. To be honest... Don't tell me you're too embarrassed to take your clothes off in front of me. I tell you she's not a child. I understand but calm down. Dorothy talked about her as though she was a new born baby. Let's not exaggerate matters. I also know her date of birth, it's just that... At the moment, I don't remember. How old do you think she is? Thirteen, fourteen? At least sixteen, if not seventeen. And you know what that means... You're only in charge of the estate until she's of age. As soon as I get back to Rome we'll deal with this problem together. Only until she's of age. Remember that. I was bored in the house. Do you mind if I stay here with you? Not at all. Can I ask you a question? What reason could my mother have had to... I don't know. Something tormented her. When I tried to get her to talk about it she became very evasive... She would make up a thousand excuses to leave. How can a person choose such a cruel death? She was exhausted. She drank a lot and she stuffed herself with pills... It was also mentioned in the autopsy report. I hadn't seen her for a few clays when the accident happened. Stay still for a moment. You have an interesting face. Do you really mean it? Let me see your profile. Turn around. Slowly. You're naturally photogenic... But you're still very young. To be model... It takes time. Gianna, please. I'm so bored in this house. Tenderly, like a trembling fawn lost in a forest. That's scared because it can't find its mother. Forgive me. You must be a girl who has nothing to hide, isn't that right, Nancy? I would never have imagined you to be so uninhibited. Well? How did it go? I made in time to block the situation. There are always problems with last minute surprises like this. It's strange you don't love horses. It's almost a tradition in England. I always had other interests. So you finished school. What did you get your diploma in? In nothing... I had another two years left but after mother's death I decided to stop there. She'll stay here. With us. It seems like the ideal solution. Your father was American? Yes, but I was born in Paris. Mum thought it was very chic. And then one boarding school after another. You mustn't think about it anymore. We are your family now. Are you dining with us? No, I can't stay. Marco promised to take me sailing. Be careful, the lake is dangerous at this time of the year. It's a tranquilliser. The doctor prescribed it. I'll be back later to check up on you. It wasn't Marco who saved me, was it? He did what he could. I had a bad dream... Marco didn't come to help me. But he was laughing. Laughing, and laughing. It was just a nightmare. Try to rest. I was the first to find her. But it was too late. Then the police came. What could have pushed her to such a desperate act? Even if the door was locked from the inside... I never believed it was suicide. One night I went to see you. To tell you, but then... Then, at the last minute, I lost my nerve. No, no, it's impossible. I knew her very well. She was a happy person. Full of the joy of living. It's impossible. There was a party, the night before... Where's Dorothy? How did it go? There's nothing I can do. The bank doesn't trust me... They want Dorothy's signature as well. Where is she now? Your wife has other problems. She's in her room. Some manners. Didn't they teach you to knock? I need to talk to you. About what? You know very well. About that property deal. It was a bad deal... And I did warn you. However, it doesn't concern me. You wanted to do it your way, now deal with it yourself. It's a bad situation, Dorothy. I'm in serious trouble. You have to help me. I have to? Why? I've been supporting your bad deals, and your little whores for years. But not anymore. I'm not giving you another penny. We had a deal... Everyone for themselves... Free to do as they please. But you're still my wife. And in a grave situation like this... I'm tired. I don't want to be the fool who maintains her penniless handsome noble anymore... You can keep your nobility, your ancestry... Your cardinals and your pope! Your family tree... All of it. Enough. I want a divorce. She really did love that child... The age gap wasn't an obstacle. Dorothy was above certain hypocritical conventions. You were very close to my mother. I've been in her employment for many years... And she was always very kind to me. Scared? Not at all, speed excites me. I never thought I'd find such a young and sporty father. Thanks for the ride. Where are you going? I've decided to visit the city. I'll come with you. I'd rather go alone. I don't want to be distracted. Giovanni, have you seen Nancy? I believe she's on the terrace. Stop it. You're tickling me. Let's not disturb the meditating artist. Always alone, like a hermit. It must have been a very funny film. We changed our minds, we went for a drink instead. More than one drink! Pour me a glass as well. This is the last one. You haven't managed to capture my personality. I don't recognise myself in these photographs... Not at all. You decide, Marco. Now that you know me better. Does that insignificant, dull, fool look like me? I'll do it. You've got it ail wrong. Go on, take some pictures. Come on, take it. Now you'll see the real Nancy. Put some music on. It helps me. We're just playing now. Leave the nudes for another day. That's enough now. You should be in bed. Come on, Nancy. Didn't you want to photograph my body? Then what are you waiting for? If you think you can provoke me, you're mistaken... Put your clothes back on. What have you got against me? I decide when to work, not the model. You've been tough on me, lately. As though we were enemies. Aren't we? You know that's not true. You've done so much for me. I was just a lost child who had just left school. You helped me find myself. I don't understand. I like you. You're like a mother to me... And I never had one. Nancy. What's wrong? I can't breathe. I don't understand it, but every time I take those damned drops. What drops? Gianna insists I take them every night... After the accident. Try to rest. It's nothing. You'll see. It's nothing. Don't worry. I feel better now. No, don't get up. You're still too weak. I'll sleep somewhere else. With Gianna? What are you thinking? Did you really love my mother? You see... Your mother and I... No, I didn't love her. That's the truth. In the beginning, perhaps. But living together became impossible... We lived separate lives in the end. I didn't love her either. She was like a stranger to me. Don't go. Who was it? I don't know, wrong number. Do you regret last night? Why should I? I'm sure Gianna is more of a woman than me, right? Don't be absurd. These comparisons are ridiculous. Forgive me, but I'm young and I still haven't learn to be a hypocrite. She's a girl who knows how to make people like her. And you need to hate someone in order to kill them. A wrong move might arouse suspicion about Dorothy's death. Let me take care of it. What you getting an? It's better if you don't take any initiatives... Perhaps there are other solutions. What's Dorothy got to do with it'? There's no evidence against us. Against me, definitely not. Still live in Trastevere? Always. And your husband? Still in America? He'll be back next month. And that bed is too big for one person. No doubt that's a problem but with some good will we'll try to resolve it. Tell me, when I invited you to live here were you already Marco's lover... or did that come later? I already was. Not that it matters, I usually give my old clothes to the servants... And husbands to friends. Pour me another drink. Pick it up. What are your intentions with that youth? Who? Paul? He's marvellous. I adore him. He makes me feel alive. Obviously, it will cost me clearly. I know very well I could be his mother... But I like it this way. At least Paul is young. Yes, I killed her. But this doesn't change anything. Just leave Nancy alone. I'll take care of her. In what way? I don't know yet. Okay, this time I'll be the one who stands by and watches. You'll do it. One thing is certain... We mustn't rush things. Leave it It was my fault. You can go. And... Thank you. Thanks again. Are you sure you don't need anything? No, you can go. What's wrong? I'm thinking what it must feel like to die in an electric chair. Do you mind buying me a new one? What is it? A resistor... It can't cost more than 500 lira. Just enough to give someone a shock. Be careful, with all your traps... Sooner or later, you'll get burnt. I placed a bet on number eight for you as well. I'm going to make a bet as well. You could've asked Francesco. I feel like a walk. Did you bet? Alone? Of course. I thought I saw you with someone. You're wrong, I was alone. You're not getting jealous, are you? I have a right to be, don't I? Typical Latin lover, passionate and possessive. Even if I do like it a little bit. What a disappointment... I don't see any Chinese puzzles or butterfly collections. Why did you want to come here? Because I'm interested in everything about you.. And I want to know you better. There can't be any secrets between us. Do you mind if I have a shower? Who is calling? Do you mind if I use your bath robe after my shower? Who were you calling? Are you expecting someone? If it's a jealous lover I can always hide in a cupboard. You're a strange girl. What do you see in me? The worst. But I still love you. You must leave Gianna... I don't want to share you with anyone. What's wrong? Calm down. He tried to... How did it happen? We were coming back from the races... All of a sudden he... It was horrible. It's my day off tomorrow, I left everything in order. What's going on? What happened? I don't know. Is she hurt? No, she just fainted. Stay with her. You go to Magda. Where were you when it happened? In the kitchen... I was checking the supplier's accounts. I'm afraid. That man... Marco. Relax. I'm sure it was him. He tried to kill me. Now I know that day by the lake... You're not thinking straight. That man is a murderer. I have proof, believe me. I'm begging you. Let me stay here with you. Only you can save me. I don't want to go back to that house... I'm afraid. But... What do you mean, proof? A letter. A letter? From my mother... It's dated the day before she died. It was addressed to my school. She wasn't thinking of suicide... It talks about the future, of love, about starting over. And where is this letter? She says she was fed up of Marco. She wanted a divorce. I don't believe she wanted to kill herself. And Magda didn't believe it either. And you? Well, the police investigated... And they concluded it was suicide. It's difficult to reopen the case, you need evidence... Not suspicions. Don't go, I need your help. You're upset. Try to get some rest. I want to stay here with you. We have to find it. That letter could incriminate us. Here it is. She must have hated me so much to write... . this tirade of rubbish against me. Magda is also a threat. We must act immediately. Pull it with your left hand. Loosen the other cord. There. It's starting to turn. Make sure the other one's loose. Now pull the cord away. Perfect. How dare you go through my belongings. Murderers. She made the mistake of wanting to know too much. No-one will miss her, she was alone in the world. Now you're the only person who knows the contents of this letter... But you won't be able to tell anyone. No, we won't leave any marks on your body... It's too beautiful. It would be a shame to disfigure it. Let go of me. They'll think you committed suicide. We've got it all worked out. They won't have any proof against us. Let go of me. Get everything ready. I'll take care of her. Gianna, open it. I told you to open it. Have you gone mad? What are you doing? Why do you want me dead? I'm suffocating. We killed Dorothy. Her death made sense. Magda's death also made sense. But mine? What's the point? What do you gain? Why are you doing this? Open it. Open it. You did well to trust me. It all went perfectly. You were great. I only did what you asked me to. The part where you fainted was your masterpiece. Right, I can believe that. I didn't expect another dead body. Magda was a threat to him, and Marco acted alone... I didn't know anything about it. You don't need to be scared anymore. We're free of your mother's killer. Forever. Fine. I'll prepare the suitcases. I'll go down and deal with Marco's body in a moment... And lock the door from the inside. Then we can leave. And we'll finally be alone... You and me. Get your filthy paws off me. I was convinced you'd killed Dorothy. And I don't like people taking my plate away while I'm eating. I didn't have proof. Now I do. What is the meaning of this? What Nancy? Stop calling me that stupid name. My name's Mirella She's my girlfriend. She always was. Did you really think the little girl could fall in love with you? By the way, the real Nancy is about arrive... If you hurry, you can pick her up from the airport. You need to know how to lose. And you lost. Go to your friend. I took him to the garden, half dead... To recover. He needs a friendly hand. We killed Dorothy. Her death made sense. Magda's death also made sense. But mine? What's the point? Dorothy's letter... A red herring. I was certain you would've betrayed each other. The gun shot. Poisoned drops... The electric shock. I planned all of it. Pick up the pen, friend. And don't miss out any zeros. I'll give you the cassette as soon as I cash the cheque. And they say zeros don't count. Do you mind if I take this? As a reminder of my poor mother. All done? Can we go? All done, my sweet. Bury the poor maid. Her body will stink after three days. So where are we going? Montecarlo? The Canaries? The Bahamas? Wherever you want. We can do anything. The world is ours, let's not keep it waiting. Faster... The world is ours. Faster. "I'm suffocating! Open it! Why do you want me dead? What's changed between us? We killed Dorothy. Her death made sense. Magda's death also made sense. But mine? What's the point? What do you gain? What's the point? Open it."
