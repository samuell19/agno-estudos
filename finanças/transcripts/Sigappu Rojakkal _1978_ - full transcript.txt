I don't want this tea. Go. Today it's the blue pants and blue coat. - Where is the secretary? - He has gone to jail. He said he'll go first and you'll join him later. - Today is October 12th. - My birthday isn't it? It's a habit to give the prisoners something today. He said he'll go and arrange for it first and then you can go. - Files that need your signature. - Spare me for today. You can go. - How old are you? -16. You should be in school. Ran away because you couldn't afford it? - Yes. - I don't wish you to waste your life in the kitchen at this age. Get ready to go home this evening. I'll give you a thousand rupees. Fine, I'll send 500 rupees every month. Life sentance. He poisoned one whole family in a internal feud. He strangled a 5 year old child for gold jewelry. He murdered his wife out of suspicion but now he repents it. Can I ask you one question? I've been here 3 years and seen you here each year on your birthday. I suspect there is a deeper reason for this. Am I correct? My basis for this is merely humanitarian. Society fails to see the many criminals out there. We use circumstantial facts to convict often. Doesn't work all the time. While the guilty may roam the streets, the innocent should not be in here. I too have been affected by your department. - In which way? My father was imprisoned wrongly and has since lived as a lunatic. I come to present those who may be like my father. If what you say is true, I feel very sorry. - I'll come. - Say you're leaving. This is the jail. I will come. On my next birthday. -Eaten? - Yes. - Are they here for the interview? - Yes. - Are you all here for the interview? - Yes. I am the manager. You won't get up. It's the effect of your age. Give it. You're determined to get the job. You will get it. I can see the beauty of your heart. On your face. Give it. Aren't you Sabapathy daughter? No, my father's name is Gopalakrishnan Oh the one works in LIC building isn't it? I know! I have seen you when you were five years old. How is your father? Continue laughing, is it expensive to laugh? The ladies are here sir. Ladies are here. for the steno interview. You interview half while I take care of the rest. There are many of them. I thought sharing the job will make it easier. Go and do your work. Do you always dress up in this manner? Sometimes I don't bother with putting anything. I'm strict in this matter. You said you're of royalty yet you're stingy with putting alms! It's not easy to tell who the real beggers are. - Your name? - Lakshmi. - Previous place of employment? Raja mathas'. - How many years? - 5 months. But it was I who chose... - Your hobbies? - Watching blue films, night clubs, drinks. Instead of making it a taboo, a proper punishment would work. - Why not further your studies? - With a MA, I still need a job. 1 think this qualification is sufficient for me to lead a happy life. - Do you have any experiance? - In what? I mean within steno, receptionist, personal assistant - which of it? This is an interview for a steno. - Why this job hopping? -1 don't act in a subordinated manner. Because the job is not a necessity for me. My brother is a pilot. Don't make noise with that thing. - What's your reaction if you don't get this? - It's your loss. I'll keep you. As a steno. We have alot of new varities. Would you like to take a look? - What would you like? - Handkerchief. - Any other variety? - Others.. One is sufficient. I was referring to the handkerchief. - What would you life? - Handkerchief. Any other colour? I like that colour. That rose on your hip. Yes, that handkerchief. There is no stock like that. I would like that. - I'll contact you when the stock comes. 1 believe you'll give it to me. I was referring to the handkerchief. - He comes often. Boyfriend? - Keep quiet. A thousand customers may come. Does that make them my boyfriend? I asked as he came often. None of my regulars are young and hip. You've started. Look, there's a young man there. Go there now. - What would you like? - A brasseire. - What size? - Any size. Didn't your wife tell you the size? 1 am still not married. Okay, I understand. Connect me to the steno. I am Sundram speaking here. - Isn't Chitra there? -1 think she hasn't come for the last 2 days. Connect me to the manager. - He's elsewhere. I'll send him in. - Chitra didn't come? - That has upset me alot too. - Great joke. Did she submit a leave letter? - No. - Called? - No. - Wait for 2 days; then get someone else for the job. Mouli wants another quotation. Get the papers from her table. Move quickly. - Sleeve or sleeveless? - 1 prefer sleeveless. Yes, the sleeveless would look better for you. Sleeves are for the old. - The next time. -Will you come? - Certainly. At least for you. The stock you wanted has come. I cut it thinking you would buy it. Add this price to my bill as well. I will pay for it. Keep this as my present. I wasn't referring to the handkerchief or this book. - Do you love that man? - Nothing like that. - Then shall I work on him? - Shut up. Since you said you don't love him, why get so angry? Aren't you ashamed of throwing yourself at everyone? My salary leaves me with 40 rupees after expenses. Can my mother, sister and I live just on that? But I am not a whore. A smile here helps the shop; outside, helps me! I've finished your book. - So fast? How was it? Not nice at all. - Who do you need? -1 am Chitra's brother here. Greetings. I am the manager. Still single. What do you need? - Can you call her to the phone? - She doesn't come anymore. - Don't you know? - I was outstation for 10 days. Just returned. I saw your company's card at home. So.. She worked for 10 days. Then she suddenly stoppped coming. She didn't write in or call us. The neigbours said that she hasn't been home for a week. We've replaced her here. You'd better check with your relatives. Who do you want? Sheela? Sheela, call for you. I couldn't recognise your voice. 5 at the Gandhi Statute. Wearing white with a red rose. Okay! I'll come there and talk. Definately. I'm heading out. Don't ask why. You must come over tomorrow. Did you call? You're not even the height of my shoes. Yet this? Yes. Then who might have called? No more ice cream for the day. - Take care of that. - You seem to have extra work with Sheela absent. The work is not tough. It is just boring without her around. - Wonder why she's missing. - She didn't tell you either? She left after a call and told me to drop by her house for her birthday. 1 will drop by on her before I go home. Are you injured? It's dangerous to walk alone and be careless. Come get into the car. - Where must you go? - Mount Road. Women's hostel. Why were you here then? - I was coming to my friend's place. - So to your friend's house or the hostel? - I'll go to the hostel. -1 can drop you at your friend's house. - No, I'll go to the hostel. Staying in a hostel suggests that you're not a native of this place. I'm from Kumbakonam. Father's dead. Only mother is around. She's staying with my uncle. Sitting and not talking to the driver at night can lead to accidents. - What should I say? - Fine, I'll talk. Just answer my questions. - Do you think badly of me as I come to the shop often?- Nothing like that. - About me coming to your section often? - Nothing about that. - Me handing out gifts to you whom I don't know? - Nothing about that. - If I say I love you now, will you misunderstand me?- Nothing.. She displays a flash of light in her eyes; oh dear beautiful one! The bird of the love domain seeks a relationship of joy! Heaven would be you. This girl displays a flash of light in her eyes; oh dearest lord! The bird of the love domain seeks a relationship of joy! Heaven is on my hands. This girl displays a flash of light. - Shall we go for a movie? - No, the warden would be in. - How can I bring her too? - No. She'll scold if we're late. -When then? - Sunday. - Your warden won't object to this. Are you bringing the warden with you? The joy of this young girl is the places her lord takes her too. This ocean of joy is a place where many rivers unite. My body is a dedication to you. Why do you need this rush for? - Did you like the movie? - No, it was too much of sex. - When is Vaikunda Ekathesi? - Next month. Why? No,that's when they'll play devotional films. I can bring you for that. Did you tell your folks? Find another vehicle to go to heaven! I forgot to tell you. I had a wonderful dream yesterday. - What dream? We were both in a car going through a quiet street like this. - Suddenly I stop. - And? - 1 Kiss you for the 1st time. - Fat hope. - Why stop the car? - This is a quiet street. - So? I am going to make my dream come true. Don't! Please. You're terrible. - Who did you refer to? - Us? Is this a saree shop or an asylum? She displays a flash of light in her eyes; oh dear beautiful one! The bird of the love domain seeks a relationship of joy! Heaven is on my hands! She displays a flash of light in her eyes! The garden has many flowers but you are my red rose. 1 always gave myself to you, my dearest lord! Dear flower, I yearn to pluck you! And hence I await by your side! This girl displays a flash of light in her eyes oh my dearest Lord! The bird of the love domain seeks a relationship of joy! Heaven is in your hands! This girl displays a flash of light in her eyes! You're normally very lively but you're so glum today. If you engage in an activity without experiance would it turn out well? It's very hard. You always need previous experiance to prevent harm. - So to the beach or Mahabalipuram? - Why? We're going to be married next month. Without experiance, it's tough. -1 don't get it. - Don't you get it? You're terrible. Don't you have other conversation topics at all? You watch adult movies and read English novel. Yet no interest in sex? There is alot. You'd asked me to check if the stocks were available for export. - You, the boss, laughed. - Now, the boss wants you to get out. - Must we go? Okay. Is this outfit okay? - Yes. There is a statue inside. This temple is believed to be powerful. So it is always crowded. - What did you pray for? - Nothing. I came here for you. - Are you an atheist? -1 believe for an exam you should study not pray. Is it wrong to pray to the force that is greater than us? But the temple chariots don't run on their own! We still have to pull them! Prayer is a social norm. I don't reject it. I respect it. Shall we buy a Durga statue? Do you like that one? -If you do. -1 do. - What is the price of that statue? - 18 rupees. - This seems very cheap; why not buy something more expensive? Give me that. Till now it was nagging about marriage. The next will be about kids is it? There is no rush! Only you! - In this matter of kids, everyone is a criminal. - Why do you say so? - They use the bed for their own pleasures. When the child is born, they act as if they had fasted for that child! Why are you always so cynical? Not all. Only with regards to ladies' and sex. I've seen alot in these areas. You said you hadn't loved or had relations. What do you mean now? Do you need experiance to tell you what happens if you jump from a high floor? You made me fall in love by speaking. Can I compete with that? I prefer competition at night. That white building is my..sorry, our house. He is our watchman. I've changed the gate twice but not him. No movements are missed by him. Your Madam. He is our gardener. Like the watchman too. He appreciates art alot. The evidence for that is my garden. He specialises in the red roses. Your Madam. He is my cook. His name is.. Shantha moorthy. He's a great cook. He caused me 200 rupees in doctor's fees with his food. - Well, I am here now. - Yes, let me keep the doctor at home then! Why have you stopped? - Isn't there a servant girl here? - Why? I asked because it was my first time entering the house. 1 forgot that you're the sentimental sort. My mother is not around to invite you in the traditional manner. My father loved my mother alot. Since then, I've had no other mother. Think of your favourite god, Durga. Come in with your right foot. Angry? You seem to like red alot. - Yes, that's why I chose a red saree too. - Scared? - Is that alive? - Check it for yourself. It's not alive. There's alot around. Don't be scared. This is the dining table. I don't think I ever ate here for lack of company. Everything is in the bedroom. I am a lonely man. This is your father-in- law. - That little boy is caught today. - Caught by whom? A beautiful girl, named Sarada. - You looked very cute then. -So do ll look ugly now? In such a big house,.. - Go on. - The house would be alot livelier with more servants inside. - I thought like that till now. I beg to differ now. - Why? - My full time job is increasing the population. - No, you must work. I'll come. Then I'll ask them to put a double bed into my room. - Is the bed all you think off? - Fine I'll focus on the sofa. - We're going to the bedroom. - No, I want to see all the rooms first. Then our first night will be tomorrow morning. This is my reading room cum library. - You read so much? - Yes, but I don't need these anymore. - Why? These are just the theory element. I now will get the practical element. - All those kind of books? - Not all but most. - Games room. - You only have one chair for multiplayer games. -1 play with myself. - Alone? - Yes, so that I can keep winning. I don't like meeting defeats. Then today, you will meet your first defeat. I ususally win all the games in the hostel. I will play and make you lose. You will only understand my game at night. This is another door to that room. - What room is this one? There old records my father used to use. No one uses it anymore. Let me introduce you to another of this house. - Another of my true worker cum friend. - Will it bite? Sometimes, even me too. That is the outhouse for this place. The father -in-law in the photo stays in that house. He lost his sanity after being wrongly convicted and he lives imprisoned. I can't control him. Only the garderner can control him. It's been a long time since I saw him. The fate of people can't be changed by worrying. I've already got the license for this. I will come immediately. - My managing partners want to see me. - Must you go? I'll be back soon. - Ganesh get it. -What do we do now? - Give us the ball. - She looks new. - Ask her. - Who are you? Are you hew here? There was another auntie here. She took our ball and refused to give. - We fought and took it. - How did she look like? Like a demon. He said there isn't even a servant here. Who could it be? - We need to answer responsibly. - Yes. Chitra stopped working. When I said this, the guy insisted on meeting you. How? Send him in. I will talk to him. - I'm Chitra's brother. - I know. - I am a sales representative. - She said you were a pilot officer. - My sister seeks false pride. - She has many boyfriends. - It's not her fault. Society is changing such. She's missing for a week. She was here on the day she disappeared till night. - So she vanished after work? - Yes, she had dinner that evening with one. - That boyfriend? - I don't know who he is. I heard from the waiter. - Waiter? - He's here with me. Her companion could be one of the staff. I hope you have no objection with me showing him your staff. Chitra's brother wants to meet the staff. Help him. Look at him. He is always at the bus stop where there are college girls. This one goes directly to the college itself. You can't seem him in any hotel as he owes all of them money. - Anyone here? - No one here is like the guy I saw at the hotel. - Checked? - He said that it is none of your staff. I am very sorry for your state. - Scared?- Saffron should not spill. Especially when I was putting it on. You're sentimental again. What have you done with this room? You have such a huge house but you lack a prayer room! But now you have set it up! Hang up pictures and it will be perfect. Now, everyday you must bathe and get ready .. Get up! You mustn't wear your shoes inside here! - You sound like an auntie. - "There was another auntie here." "She took our ball and refused to give it to us." I need to ask you something. - Ask. Apparently there was an "auntie" here before me. Who was it? - Who told you? - The kids from next door. Why did they come here? Nothing. Their ball.. You had rushed to the office. What was it about? You looked upset on the phone itself. Tell me what it is. - Tell me. - Nothing. - You're hiding something from me. Tell. I am your wife.. The meeting today was not easy. So.. - It's alright. - It's our first day of marriage. - You look tired. I will get you tea. - I need to go out urgently. - Okay, what food would you like? No, you must tell me what you like. You're my meal today. Angry? Promise? I'll go out and return. Then I'll ask them to put a double bed there - Is that all you think of? Fine ll shall focus on the sofa then. Fine let's go straight to the bedroom. Thoughts are a bird that spreads out its wings. It will fly and begin its relationship! Thoughts are a bird that spreads out its wings. It will fly and begin its relationship! Thoughts are a bird. The drops of scent on the roses slide - honey like jewels. That is the honey that is rare - why have you yet to consume it? It is for that I am so excited. I came. I came to give. Thoughts are a bird that spreads out its wings. It will fly and begin its relationship! Thoughts are a bird. When I shiver in winter, would your gaze be my cover? I am shivering without an embrace - hence ll lie on your lap Is my lap your personal swing? You are, from how me. Thoughts are a bird that spreads out its wings. It will fly and begin its relationship! Thoughts are a bird that spreads out its wings. It will fly and begin its relationship! Thoughts are a bird. Looks like the water pipe is leaking. The scratches on my young heart still throb as thorns in my heart. They act as my mirror and reflect the harshness on me. My thoughts, again and again, again and again, .. Your animal has wreaked havoc! It got tied up! Your auntie's after you! - Catch him! - Arrogant fellow! - Leave me! Let me go! Stop! You orphan! You've made the cow bleed to death! You can't look after the cow well! What do you want then?! Wait! Your mother left you and went! I've to put up with this! Don't hit me! - Useless fellow! Running away? Go! Go to hell! Don't come back home for food! - He said he hasn't eaten for 3 days. - Eat slowly. Don't rush. - Don't choke. - Why not we feed him and let him help us out? Okay, let him stay. I have no objections. - I'm late. Father I'm leaving. - Go carefully. Here wash your hands. I'm going to temple. When Pankajam comes tell her to make coffee. I'll be back before 7. Look after the house. It's a new pail. Careful. You're always careless. Mother asked you to make coffee and drink when you come back. - Where's she? - Temple. - Where did you say? - Temple. - When will mother come? - She said she'll come before 7. Can you help to take the sugar container for me? - What is it? - Can you hook the blouse for me? - Leave me! - The boy is good but not too sure about the rest. Leave me! Look at what he did! You treated him as your own son! When no one was around, he held my hand and .. What will I do? I don't understand anything! My body is shivering! Is this what you do in return for us feeding you? - How could you? - I thought of you as a son! Scum! - No! - If I'd known you were such, I wouldn't have let you in! - Don't hit! - Get out! - We should kill you for this! How dare you?! Let me in! I haven't eaten in 4 days! Please! He looks like a poor thing! Let him in! Let him in! - What is it? - I've not eaten for 4 days. Give me the biscuit. - I will work for it. - We will deal with that later. You eat first. - Doesn't he seem pitiful? - Yes. He seems like a good kid too. Let him stay here and eat and go! - You will be back soon? - I'll finish the work in 4 days. Eat regularly. Your medicines are there. Take care. - Why keep repeating it? - You never remember. What can I do? It's a habit. Madam is scared to be alone. Stay with her at home. Look after the house! I will go to the airport with him and come. Bag. - It's okay. - Just give it! - It's getting late. Come. Did you call me mother? Do I look like one to you? Call me sister. Madam is scared to be alone. Stay with her at home. Bring my bag in. - What is that sound? - Madam.. - She's very bad. - What are you saying? Madam is with someone in the room .. Don't do anything to me! Kill them! All this women are like this! Devils! Demons! Stab her! You are like a son to me who is childless! I will bring you up right! When I have no child, I will bring you up the right way! That is how I grew up! Your sixth victim was Sheela! Only tonight will you understand my game! You're my meal tonight. That girl Chitra the other day,.. - What's this? - For you to not talk. - For me to not talk? Is that so? How many months? Did you murder her? - Take this. - Wait. This is a big issue - not just for eating or something. - What do you want? - This is fair. I've always had a desire. An outlet with an AC room and 10 employees where I am the owner. I can get a bank loan but it's easier to get it from you. 50,000. Fine leave it then. - Look, 20000. - Not 50 then. 40735? - 25, - 1 was a little late. - Not just a little but very late. I entered the no entry zone and the police stopped me. I'll park and come. That girl you brought has seen everything! She's seen it all! What were you doing? Dilip is in the hospital. They suspect he has a mental disorder. - Isn't the case peculiar? - This is due to childhood incidents. Can you imagine how frustrated he must be? He killed each person; buried them and planted a rose plant. In the morning, he takes the rose flower and puts it in his pocket. - It's interesting. - But I wouldn't say that he alone is responsible. Society too is responsible. Ignorance of law cannot be excused. Similarly in Bombay, 15 years ago, they'd arrested a guy Raman. He too had been affected by a childhood incident and ended up such. But circumstances do not change the fact that a crime is a crime. You can't converse with him because he doesn't understand us. He's beyond all of that. Come let us have a look. Today is October 12th. Your birthday. - Take it. - Take it! Say that you're leaving. This place is jail. I'll be back. For my next birthday. I didn't expect you to continue to have such deep attachment. Why not change your mind? You can come to another decision. 1 believe in God. I prayed that this nupital remains on me forever. Come let's go. "Saratha, my wife."
