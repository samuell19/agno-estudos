Ok, Tralala. Thanks, Babak. Yesterday, it was delicious Today it's still good And tomorrow it'll be gone Good luck. I turn on a light In the eyes of girls Before everything goes Off the rails I burst into flame In the fire My demo tape Is my life on the wire Like an LP In a techno world Where are all my friends today?

I give myself a hug Abandoned to my fate My heart in stalemate The curtain falls like a dead weight Over summer's estate The curtain falls like a dead weight Over summer's estate You smell very nice. Sing some more. Hand in hand It wasn't planned Yet it's grand It's such a thrill To surrender one's will To a sweet ill Night is a morning In paradise Reclining in a meadow so nice Naked Off the radar With the roaches now far Who are you? You're too beautiful to be real. May I kiss you? Above all... do not be yourself. Were you with the young lady? Yes. Your change. - Has she left? - Yes. She appeared as I sang At Montparnasse Station As bright as a train I recognized her Among the beggars there As if she were walking on air The Holy Virgin Reaching out to me As blue as a Greek island The Holy Virgin She alone can save me Welcome to Lourdes. All pilgrims disembark. The girl in blue Brunette or blonde, who knows? She's our obsession She alone loves and understands us The girl in blue Our transparent heart Is no longer torn In the pale early morn She shows us the way To our destiny if we stray The girl in blue The girl in blue The girl in blue The girl in blue The girl in blue That's not how it works. There are rules, as you know. We don't like you troubadours. I just got here... Get lost! Good luck. That was great, thanks. I'm a strange bird Looking for a blue sky Where are you, my blue angel? My strange bird Who gives me wings Do not be yourself Do not be yourself Do not be yourself Do not be yourself Do you know her? Just an impression. I don't understand. Just an impression. Her eyes. What'll you have? A beer. Your madonna? Yes. Excuse me... Did the Virgin appear several times to that girl... Bernadette? 18 times. Really? Did she call her or did the Virgin... Bernadette... Prayed. Thank you. I've got it now. She's like the girl from the Hotel de la Consolation. Is it her? Yes. The girl from the Hotel de la Consolation. Thank you very much. - Hello, sir. - Hello. I met this young lady in Paris yesterday. I have something of hers. Do you know her? Do you know her? No. I met this young lady in Paris yesterday. I have something to give back to her. Forget her and get out, understood? Understood. Throw him out! Go! Hello. It's me. The singer from Montparnasse Station. How are you? We had a drink in Paris last night. I crossed France to find you. You forgot your lighter. "Do not be yourself," remember? Are you ok? Virginie! Virginie! Virginie! Where were you? In Paris? - Hello, ma'am. - Sir. Is she a damsel in distress? Or am I fooled more or less? Is she on drugs What's the prognosis? ls she under hypnosis? She who alone loved me And also understood me No longer knows me today Is she just a mirage? In blue The Virgin is named Virginie Her castle Consolation Tomorrow I shall carry her away I the Knight of the Banjolele But where to sleep? Tomorrow I'll improvise The Virgin has a panther's eyes The troubadour! What're you after? Revenge, with your banjo? I don't blame you. Competition can be tough. I just want a place to sleep. I can pay. Who are you? I'm a singer. With money problems. - Where from? - Paris. You could rake it in from the tourists in Montmartre. Yes, but... The truth. Last night in Paris, I had a drink... with a girl. She lives here. I must see her. Sentimental? Very. A lot. What's your name? They call me Tralala. I'm Climby. Upper floor burglar, as the courts say. After 50, it gets tough. Follow me! Paradise? You're there, man. We don't linger here. It's sacred. No drinking or smoking. The water's off. Shower at the public baths. Hi, Pexu! Hi, Lolo! - Hi, Climby. - Tralala. Good evening. Hi, Philou, enjoy your meal. If you behave, you'll meet Lilli tomorrow. She'll fix your fate. She puts us up. That's kind. Sentimental and polite. Sleep in peace, Tralala. Thank you. My son My child Here you are Back home A beam of sunshine In which the dust dances In the room of a hotel Our hotel I see you as on your first day You who left so long ago You who left to travel around For twenty years For a thousand years From what hells have you returned? You, so silent for so long Whom I waited for so long When so many believed You had drowned at sea You carry the smell of the cities Visited along the way And the smell of the wasted years I'd recognize it anywhere Those years that I've spent With a splint on my heart By simply uttering your name The pain would depart You're here now Sweet and calm Bringing me back to life Patrick... My Pat... I've imagined this moment so often. You're not dreaming. It's me. In the flesh. Like you. I knew it. I always said so. knew, if you came back, you'd come to the Santa Lucia. To your room. Number 5. Climby told me, "The new guy sings, he's sweet and his name's Tralala." I knew it was you. Your sweetheart? Yes. She isn't here? No, but... Will she be joining you? Yes. Probably. A miracle. Ok, Lilli? Just fine. It's Pat, my son. He's back. I knew it. Pat? I couldn't say. I was scared you wouldn't recognize me or think I was mad. Bath-time. You stink and that's not like you. Bring your stuff. - I have nothing. - At all? My banjolele. I got robbed. The sun smiles on you. Or the son! Come on, I live nearby Ok, fine. Pat, Pat, Pat... Quick a few clues If I must Step into your shoes Only you could put that song on. You live alone? Yes, and it suits me. Dad? No news. To hell with him! I left the Santa Lucia 15 years ago. I couldn't afford to renovate. But I kept it all the same. house the underprivileged there. Pat... You left too soon, too quickly, too far. But I never believed you were dead. I always sensed our hotel was like a final beacon in the night, if you weren't totally lost and wanted to come back. And you have come back. You're a man now. Mum... But you? Me... It would take too long to tell. It would take too long... yet no time at all. I dreamed a lot. My dreams shattered. I ended up on the street. And I was ashamed to say so. You fool! Mothers are there for that. You're home, that's what matters. It's wonderful. Your beard always disgusted me. When you were 20, I couldn't do a thing, but now... Your father left this ages ago. I was right to keep it. Shave away your past. Are you sure? You're not 20 now. Three days later, you left for the USA. Get rid of the one who left. Just show me the one who came back. You're right. Give me a few days. I may not recognize myself. I'll give you two days. After your bath, we'll go to see Seb. He works at the Pontoon. Seb? Do we call him or surprise him? What do you think? Let's not give him time to think. We'll buy you a shirt. Got no money? No. The bath! Robin and Balthazar, your nephews. Born after you left. Hi, Grandma. Hi, Robin. Hi, Balthazar. Meet your Uncle Pat. - No way. - Awesome! Hi. - I'm Balthazar. - Robin. Crazy. Dad'll go wild. Hi, Robin, hi, Balthazar. Glad to meet you. Seb! A visitor. Someone back from far away.

Things aren't great. I got robbed on the train. l always said he'd come back. No one comes back from the dead Who are you? No one comes back from the dead It's just not true I've already died once And it's left a scar You're not my brother So tell me who you are Coming back here all innocent So shamelessly Coming back here all innocent Tell me who you might be When he vanished I never got over it No one comes back from something like that Never again No one comes back from the dead Not anymore If you're not my brother Then tell me who you are Coming back here All innocent So shamelessly Coming back here all innocent So shamelessly What a pain.

Boys, I want you all at the Santa Lucia tonight. A surprise. Seb... Bring your brother back? I'll go. You have lots to talk about. Thanks for the coffee. That was heavy! Get me a Ricard, guys. It's 11 AM. You usually start at 12. It's 11 on a special day. At our gigs, you barely grunted in English. Are you back as a bum to avoid admitting you made it? Made it? As a singer. If I had, you'd know. I've given up on that. You're good. One thing I found on my crap trip. Jeannie works here at midday. She'll be here soon. Yeah? Great. She was mad at you for ages. With reason. And you? How are things? One nurse doesn't make a summer No way Migrate or lose your feathers Migrate Dad! The ice guy! Thank you, Pat. I think we have a few things in common. A puddle is all he sees Hiding the lake's beauties Trapped in a prison Even confined by the horizon Jeannie? Jeannie! Seb told me. I just got here. I nearly fainted. It's crazy. Eyes don't lie. How are you? I'm good. Yes, I'm good. And you? Me... A hello kiss? Alright. You're another man! Yet still the same one. Seb said you were homeless in Paris. Yes. Until today. Want to go for a walk? Here, you're like a customer. I have half an hour. Dad? You're mad you didn't go too. It's crazy what he's seen. How he talks about it. You understand English now? It's a change from ice. He burned out. It inspires us.

Shit... - It feels good. - You bet. It's crazy. Time doesn't exist. Your tongue just feels a bit thicker. The last time we kissed, I was still growing. Coming? There's no harm in trying. That's true. As mad as ever... Shit, I'm late! Jeannie? It wasn't good? It was. It was. I'd never felt anything like it. But it wasn't you. It's not you. You're not Pat. What do you mean? I know. You're not Pat. That kind of thing... I can't be wrong. What thing? I don't know. A way... You've no mole on your left buttock. Maybe it moved. The mysteries of nature. People change. Do you dance like at 17? I don't dance anymore. Maybe I wouldn't know you if I saw you dancing now, 20 years later. Stupid. I have to run. Eating at the Pontoon? I'll look after you. I'll have lunch with Mum in town. I'll walk back. Whoever you are, I won't let you go until I've pierced your mystery. Where did you and I first make love? I remember it was here. You annoy me. You annoy me. I'm off. So long, Jeannie. Hi, Jeff. Hi, Seb. Pastis and mint? Give me a Ricard. Trouble at the Pontoon? Yes, I wanna see the boss. She's with Virginie. What is it? I wanna see Barbara, she's the boss. Explain, we're busy here. - Are you deaf or stupid? - Sorry? What? If you want money, leave now. And put your mask on. Ok up there? It'll be ok. I locked the door. Sebastien wants a word. In private. Hello, Sebastien. A problem at the Pontoon? It's over. Sorry? Us two, it's over. What? Come over here. What's the matter, Seb? You have to tell me that now? Try asking why I'm saying it. I don't know. I suppose you've met someone. You have a reputation. Besides, I can't give you more. And even you can't give me more. The boss and the lackey. Cut it out. We both have our own lives. I don't understand what's going on. Explain. Your great secret love is back. The real one. The original. The copy is stepping down. Wait. Come here. I don't understand. My brother isn't dead. Pat is back in Lourdes. He's alive? He's alive. Homeless and broke. A gift from heaven for you. Boss. What did that jerk want? Nothing, he was drunk. Ok, we'll talk about it later. The psychiatrist can see Virginie this afternoon. The hospital can take her tonight. Isn't committing her too hasty? Barbara, yesterday, some tramp some stinking maniac turned up at reception asking to see her. He said he'd spent a night with her in Paris. It can't go on. It happens more and more often. One day, she won't come back. You want that? A tramp? Yes, a tramp. I am a hotel People enter me People pray in me People sleep in me In me, people love each other I, myself another My own image I do not see I await only thee I am a hotel Paul! Watch the exit. Virginie isn't in her room. Well? No sign of her. I'm at my wits' end. We'll end up mad next. I'm calling the cops. Pat? Barbara? What happened? Who is he This stranger from the blue? Can it be The one I knew Is the man Who made me climax three times? Who is he This sweet oddball? Could it be That all I can do is fall Abandoned into his arms? Who is he? How can I know? Where is he from? Do I know his hands though His ass, his back His caresses and his voice? Who is he? I'm at a loss Where is he from? Now our paths cross Yet I already know him Can it be That love Is washing over me? Making me take The unknown For the known Can it be That love Is washing over me? Making me take The known For the unknown Intractable And nude Impractical To look at this dude Without seeing in him My love of the past And for him I have all my time It's to him That I offer these forty years of mine A woman's finest age I think I miss yours. I followed your call. Do you hear mine? Send me a sign. "Her voice still flows to the sound of the grotto's stream, as in paradise." Hello Excuse me, sir I think I forgot a postcard at this table This one no doubt. Thank you very much It was lying here. "As in paradise." Excellent. Climby, it's working! He Was asking "Have I finished with life? Has the time come? Have I overdone it Have I exhausted The splendour?" Living that again My poor heart Is not keen It would not last More than an hour Beneath the burden Of the splendour Pines over turquoise water That vision The miracle continues. An island Apart from you, I missed this the most. The back of a hand on eyelids Yet I feel Deep down inside That it's there Holding me back Holding me up Hour by hour The splendour Tonight, I'll reopen Paradise for your return.

I lied to find her and now I've lost her. That lie could be the first step towards another truth. Just be patient. I'm at the end of my tether. Does God improvise? It's what He does best. Me too. Me too. Excuse me. I was going to the Santa Lucia. wanted one last drink. I wanted to talk. It's all so old now. Yet so present too. Two days ago, Virginie returned devastated from who knows where. She had been missing a week. Like a final prayer, I locked her in my room, our room, number 617. Our room that I've held onto, just as I've held onto our love. And now you're here. The miracle occurred. Pat... If you want, the Hotel de la Consolation is your home. Our home. Benjamin will accept a divorce. The hotel is mine, all the money too. Let's make a life together. The three of us, with Virginie. Jesus Christ my love I feel part of the world These faces are so beautiful On motionless bodies Jesus Christ my love Women are so beautiful They always leave in the air A scent of the eternal Say yes, Pat. Why not? Jesus Christ my love If only you knew how The world keeps on living How people keep on marrying In the depths of cafes Jesus Christ my love For now, I need to sleep. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. If you marry the hotel boss, I'll be your mistress. Tralala. I may not be made to settle down. And lying all the time is exhausting. But where can I go? Look at the sea Near the ship Beyond the palm tree There on the lip Where silver enlightens The horizon We were two lovers Beneath the covers Can you not see The happy days coming? They're truly there And to think we lived Without them Until now Stare into my eyes Look deep into my gaze See if you recognize Don't fall into a daze It's just a promise Awaiting you No need to rush to bliss For now anew Can't you see The happy days coming? They're truly there And to think we lived without them Until now Were you so pretty at 17? - Yes? - No, Jeannie! Dad? Dad? Yes, come in! - Jeannie! - Come in, Virginie, it's open. Oh, sorry. No... It's ok, Dad, there's coffee for three. Thank you, Virginie. I never had room service before. You're Jeannie? That's right. I work at the Pontoon. That's where I've seen you. Did you sleep well? Yes, very well. Me too. I'm seeing a doctor this afternoon I want to travel without you worrying. I've changed. I want to remember so as to tell you. Then I'll go away, in a few days. To Sumatra, if that's ok. Sumatra's really far away. Pat? - Everything ok? - Yes, Mum, fine. Come in, Grandma. - You're there, Virginie? - Yes. Sorry, I'll come back later No, come in, Lilli.

Virginie... Virginie... Virginie... You're here? Where else, Dad? I love calling you that when I don't believe it. Pat probably was my father, but you... You're not Pat. You're a busker who followed me to hear my voice and get yours heard. I've got stage fright. What do we do, Seb? Vodka shot? Lilli... I need you for the balance. The balance. Why? Please, Mum. If you think that beyond the blue If you think there's something better for you Go If you overload On seeing A road Without taking it Go We'll forget you That we can do But for now For our happiness anyhow Make your farewells good Will you? There's nothing for a party here Just the noble gesture Just the right word Make your farewells good Will you? All we await Dear friend Is just the noble gesture Just the right word If you think that beyond the blue The rain will not wet People like you Go If you think that beyond the blue Dogs Do not bark At people like you Go We'll forget you That we can do But for now For our happiness anyhow Make your farewells good Will you? There's nothing for a party here Just the noble gesture Just the right word Make your farewells good Will you? All we await Dear friend Is just the noble gesture Just the right word Farewell. Lilli, more treble. The lake air deepens my voice. Good evening. Call me Tralala. I'll tell you a brief story. A true story that I wish I'd told my parents. My parents are dead. Dead in a small town. A small town where I was born. Far from here. It's a story. He's making it up. Is the sound ok? I carry on? No one comes back from the dead. As a boy in the town, they called me "trash can". All the same, the words rhyme with "Superman" My parents never heard this. They're gone now. So I'll tell you. One summer evening, when I was eleven, I decided to leave home to live elsewhere. I can't remember where. The journey was to take place on foot. It was sunny. It was possible. Everything was possible. The next morning, at 6:30, I left a note on the kitchen table. "Dad, Mum, I'm leaving to live my life far from here. Don't be angry with me." I had tears in my eyes. I was trembling all over. I left the sleeping house. The sun was rising. And, despite my tears, I felt like I was walking on air. The air was filled with melody. The sound of my footsteps, the birds' flight... I told myself, "So this is what it means to live your life." I walked in ecstasy like that until the far end of the town. I was already hungry, so I sat on a bench and ate an apple. I felt good. All of a sudden, there in front of me, in the tall grass, I saw a body. The prostrate body of a young man. A motionless young man. Dead. I had never seen a dead person before. I dropped everything and I ran. I ran like never before. Five minutes later, I was back home. It was 7:30. Everyone was asleep. Everything was calm. My note was still on the kitchen table. I tore it up. And I went back to bed as if nothing had happened. My heart was pounding. I had felt so scared on seeing that young man's corpse in the wild grass. But maybe he wasn't dead, but just sleeping. So I told myself I'd leave again. I'd start again. I had felt so good for a few minutes, walking towards a new life at sunrise. I'll take my guitar. And he'll wake up. I'll take my guitar. And he'll sing. At the very end In the fire I was speechless A wreck Free electron Vagabond In the infinitely tiny So I was a strange bird Of fire Crazy about a girl In blue To hell with the fear of heights I climbed the towers above As if in love As if bewitched The strange baptism occurred Above all do not be yourself Be good Be a passer-by I carved our hearts A while ago now Just the day before I crossed the wall somehow To hell with the fear of heights I climbed the towers above As if in love The strange baptism occurred Above all do not be yourself Above all do not be yourself All together All together All together English Hardsubs transcript by Fxe
