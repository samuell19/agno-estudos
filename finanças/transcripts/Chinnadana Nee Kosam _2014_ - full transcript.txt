Chinnadana Nee Kosam For You, My Little One Run how far you can. Bro, she must have gone that way. Let's go, guys. [TRAIN SIREN] Hey, come on... Where are you taking her, guys? Shut up and move. Hey, get up old man. - Who are you guys? You are being atrocious. Let me go. - I will kill everyone. Let go. Help me, please...! Somebody help me. Let go, guys. Bro, you smacked them up greatly. Superb, boy. Just superb. None of us could save her. Thanks, boy. I don't want your thanks. I want your gold. Take it off. Come on... So, are you a thief? Of course. Don't you believe me yet? You thank me but don't offer me your gold. Come on, take it off. What are you looking at? Come on... Take everything off. Come on... Make it fast. Take the gold off. Dear, it's the gold you toiled for. I will die but not give it to him. Sister is right, bro. Let us all rebel together. What say? Okay. You were motivated when it came to gold. You look united too. Where was your unity when she was attacked? Come on, tell me. Where was the unity? Damn! The country's biggest problem is not reacting to anything outside your home. Unless you honor a girl ad much as you value wealth... Our country and society will meet the same bloody fate. Change, guys. Sorry, son. No. Sorry and thanks serve no purpose. Don't just say it. Show the change in your conduct. Leave... Well said, son! If youth had this aggression, anger and rage... The whole of mankind will change for good. As long as there's a brave guy like you...

Bro... Drop me at college. I can't find my bike keys. She is always behind me for favours. It's sheer torture. Damn! Hey, you have my bike keys, don't you? No, aunt. I swear. What about this? Idiot! Hey, don't yell at him. He's your sister's son after all. Unable to bear him, she left him with us... Going on a vacation to enjoy life. Look at him. Wow! You have a great life, boy. You sleep all day. You party all night. He came home late last night. Poor boy. He slept here instead of his bedroom. Look. He didn't fall asleep, mom. He feels swooned. He can't climb stairs when he feels high. How could he possibly go to the bedroom? He is rolling on the couch. Hey, bro... Wake up. Why don't you let him sleep? You don't get my pain, mom. I've been trying to discuss his marriage with him since a week. Marriage? Yes, mom. All my college girls go crazy for him. Really? Sirisha, Radha and Pooja are head over heels in love. Look at them. Wow! They look like Bollywood heroines. What? They look like Bollywood heroines? Are her friends that beautiful? Why didn't you wake up early? Waste fellow! I wanted to have them over for a party... And introduce them to him. I wanted money but he doesn't wake up. All right. I am leaving. He isn't lucky. I can't help it. Mom, I am leaving the pictures here. Bro, you are awake?! I wanted to get my friends home to introduce them. But, you are... Thanks, bro. You are so sweet. Thank you. Thank you. - Go... Go... Bye, bro. Be ready in the evening. My entire batch will be here. Let's party. Bollywood heroines? How can I miss them? I shall find the pictures. They aren't here. Oh, mom... They aren't here too. Damn! Mommy... Come on... Have a shower first. Go... I need to see your face first thing in the morning. Okay, get to cooking. Mommy... What is it? Where are they, mommy? What? What do you want? The pictures... Which pictures? The ones Kavya showed you... What did she show me? You know, mom... Her classmates... Sirisha, Radha, Sriya, Pooja... You said they looked like Bollywood heroines. So, you weren't asleep? Uh-huh... Rascal! Enough... They are in the hall. Go look. Okay. Nitin's girlfriends are waiting. Mom! What? They look like Bollywood heroines? I don't watch Hindi movies, right? I said that because they looked fair. They don't just look like heroines. They are Bollywood heroines indeed. Really? This is Deepika Padukone. This is Katrina Kaif. This is... - Alia Bhatt, right? You know Alia Bhatt, eh? Mom...It's Ms. Savitri. You couldn't recognize Ms. Savitri? Poor boy! Your sister fooled you again. Have you lost your wallet again? Don't pity me too much. It was your wallet. How could you believe that we found a girl for you? Believing you are my parents... I got you a job at my friend's but you failed. Why do we do all this for you? If you rove around being jobless... Why would any girl marry you? She has to be flattered by my stature. Hello, no way that's happening. I just wanted to give you a chance. But, I hate arranged marriages. Very good. Have a love marriage like us then. Whoa! To hell with your love marriage. I don't know my grandpa because of what you did. Grandpa doesn't even know we exist. Instead of kicking you out like my dad did with me... Aren't I encouraging you? You are encouraging me. Well and good. But, I need to find the girl of my taste. [HONKING] Hi, Nitin... How are you? How are auntie and uncle? What's the way to road no. 10? Straight... Left... Right... Straight... Left... Right... Okay, bye... How does she know me? Who is she anyway? Hey, why didn't you tell me you had friends here? Hey, who said he's my friend? How'd you guess his name then? Oh... I didn't tell you. I can read faces. Are you crazy? How could you shout my name in public? We kept it a secret until today. Our register marriage is in a day and... How could you? Shame! - What? Register marriage? Hey, what are you saying? Shut up. You confessed it in public. Why are you lying to your friends? What the hell! What is this, huh? I am asking you what this is. Mango juice... Damn! Have you lost your mind? If you eat mangoes, lemons and tamarind in public... Everyone will guess that matter too. Which matter? Have you consulted the gynaecologist for your routine check up? What is he saying, girl? Dhanya... Baby is crying. What the hell! I don't know him. Oh... You didn't tell your best friend Dhanya? - Uh-huh... Damn! Have I revealed everything? Huh? What'd you even reveal? The matter she hid from you. Yeah. What did Nandini hide from me? She... One minute... Nandini, we better tell her. - Shut up! She's asking me not to say it. - Huh? I didn't mean that. - Shall I tell her then? Actually, that day... - Ugh! He's confusing you. We don't know each other at all. How'd you know my name then? It was on your bike. All right? One cold coffee with hot samosa, please... Let's go. Ms. Nandini... Actually... I wanted to... What is this? What do you think about me? I was calm no matter what you said. How dare you give me a love letter? You don't know me. Miss, your bill... Is every paper a love letter? But, the idea sounds good. Let me write one right now. Come on, please... When will I see her again? Bro, you look great. Mom, what the hell is this? Hey, it's your dad's birthday. Don't move. I am tying the loincloth as we are going to the temple. Tie it to him. Why are you putting me through this? I already tied him one. - Really? Turn around. - Hello... You want to see my muscles? You want to see my front? You want to see my back? You want to see my biceps? Hey, you see my husband? He is so well mannered. He looks more like an underpants model. Hmm... There's a lot of crowd. There are no special visits in this temple. Mom, wouldn't they allow me in without this attire? It's your dad's birthday today. You didn't have to dress me up like this. Hey, Nitin... - Huh? Wow! You are looking so cute. Damn! They saw me. Come on, Nitin... You have a great following, son. What the hell! It's all because of the attire. If he really had a following... He'd have brought a girl home by now. Hello... I don't get random girls home. A girls needs to enter my heart before entering our home. When will that happen? Dear, where is he going? Some girl must have entered his heart. Hey, boy... It's you! Me? - Yeah. You are...? Didn't you recognize me? You saved a girl on the train that day. Oh... Okay. You spoke so well that day. I did? - Yeah. Are you sure? Son, what do you know about Reddy sir? We haven't seen him praise anyone until now. Reddy sir is a top businessman. He is the temple's trustee. - Stop it, guys. Forget about me. We should talk about this noble man. Let me go, man. You have shown how every citizen of the society should be. Son, please repeat those words for them. Sir, it was a week ago. How would I remember it? Anyways, nice meeting you. Bye... Wait on... You shouldn't say that, son. That's a power the youth of today lacks. Every word was a principle. Whoa! I really don't remember it, sir. Don't say that. There was rage in every statement. Reddy sir, please don't mind. I have to go. - Where? I finally found you. Let me felicitate you in this temple. What? A felicitation? Thank goodness you didn't want to shave my head. My parents are waiting in the queue. I have to go, sir. Please... Your parents can't be waiting when I am here. This is our temple, son. Come on... I will take care of all the rituals. Let's go. - Sir... Sir... Sir... What about the girl? You deal with it. She is not listening to me, sir. Okay. Sorry, son. He will accompany you. He will take care of everything, okay? But, before you leave, introduce me to your parents. Take him. - Okay, sir. Reddy sir said it. I have to go that way. - No, it's this way. Come on... Sir, please don't say no. Not possible. People come to temple for peace. Dance classes would disturb the devotees. Sir, please... Listen... I can't be nicer to you. Leave... Come on, guys. Why do you get such petty issues to me? Dad, I am going. Oh Lord! Oh Lord...! Hail, Lord...! Hail, Lord...! Hail, Lord...! By the way, why'd you run like that? It was for a girl. - For a girl? Hmm... Dear, don't accuse my son in a temple. Ask him to deny it. I am telling you. He's not such a guy. Mom... Huh... Huh? You see... A mom is all eyes for her kids. But, a dad is all eyes for his kids' focus. You said she entered your heart. When are you bringing her home? Don't be so sarcastic, dear. He can get her home by evening if he wants to. Mom, stay stable. This is no easy task. I will bring her home in a week or so. Really? Challenge? Challenge! - Challenge! Dear, he finally liked a girl. Why are you sarcastic about it? He will proceed only if I provoke. Arrange for another queue here tomorrow. Oh my!! It's him. He will eat me alive. Offering... Dad, let's go. What's the hurry? - I will tell you. Come on... Tell us what it is. - Oh my god! What? She was teaching classical dance yesterday. She is training them in Karate today. You are surprising me every single time, darling. Hold on. I am coming. Son, it's you! Oh god, it's you! I didn't think I'd find you again. Yeah, sir. You found me well. Where'd disappear at the temple yesterday? I didn't disappear yesterday. But today, I sure will. Sense of humour! Friends, do you know him? Come on, sir. It's a wonder you know me. Why would they know me too? Is it? - Yeah. Want to look? - Yeah. Friends... Early morning... Train... Fight... Train star, huh? Sir, I've heard of Power Star, Super Star and also Burning Star. What's with the Train Star now? You want another surprise? Friends... Dialogue... 'Unless you honor a girl ad much as you value wealth...' Damn! She left. Sir! What is it, son? Go walk, sir. Hey, boy... Where are you going? Hey, boy... What's your name? Why do you care? Oh... You are of that type. Let me get back. Hello... Vinayak sir, I found a great chap to play young Akhil in our movie. But, he isn't telling his name, sir. Bro... Bro, please... I will tell you my name. Bro, I am Supraj. Sir, he is Supraj it seems. One minute, sir... Get up. Bro... What's your teacher's address? You just need my call sheet. Why do you need my teacher's address? Hello... Vinayak sir... Bro... Bro... Raindrops Apartments, Sagar Society, bro... Good boy. Bro... What? - What about my call sheet? Call sheet, eh? You... Go to school, shorty. Get lost. Bro... What? I gave you the wrong address. You are only short. Get lost. - Hey, stop... Dad, how long do I have to wait? Where were you until now? Just get on the bike. Sorry, boy. Give me the address. 2000 bucks... Why are you asking him for money? - This is business, dad. Tell me. I gave you the correct address. Dad, look... You are superb, son. Get lost. Raindrops Apartments... Bro, I am just asking for info. 500 bucks is too much. Why don't you give me a discount? What do you guys think? What do you guys even think of yourself? Are you the only lovers in the State? Guys all around are desperate to gift their girlfriends... A dress every day, a party every two days, a mobile once... a week, a vacation once a month and a car once a year. Hey, Ramesh... Who the hell is that? Sir... - Have you cleaned the car? I did, sir. What about us, bro? Hush! Please go, sir. He left. At that time... I am the watchman to apartments filled with beautiful girls. I give you valuable info on their timings and likes... Clearing the route for you. But, you bargain for 500 bucks. How would you maintain a girlfriend? Friendship is right for poor guys like you. Get lost! I am on duty. Please go. Poor fellows. Why do you want love? Ramesh... Huh? What do you want? Do I have to come? What is it? Nandini... Yeah, the music teacher... - No. Time's up. The Veena teacher... No. She's a karate teacher. - That's at 6am. What? You know, the girl... No free service, sir. Only 500 rupees. Oh, sure. You are helping me a lot. That's reasonable. Here you go. I finally found a fool. Let me loot everything. Sir, you want half or full? - Huh? The info... I want the full info. - I need 500 bucks extra for it. Oh... You want 1000 bucks, eh? - Yes, sir. All right. Give me the 500 bucks. I will give you a thousand rupee note. - Sure, sir. I have no problem in taking a 1000 rupee note. - Okay. As you wish. He is no ordinary fool. He is an extraordinary one. I shall loot him. Here you go. 1000 bucks... I find no joy in giving the petty details. I wish to give you the complete info. Oh... - You better pay me more. No one can change fate, you see. - Yeah, sir. Only God's screenplay... Why don't you take 1500 bucks? - Oh, yes! Here you go. So much money... Gandhi... Gandhi sir... Sir, the timings are... Morning 6 to 7 is karate class. 7 to 8 is aerobics class. 8 to 9 is bharatanatyam class. 9 to 10 is music and 10 to 11 is veena. Hindi pandit, sir... Special classes for IAS and IPS... She gives classes all day, sir. She is coming, sir. She'd yell at me if she saw us. She didn't see us, did she? Ah, she left. Sir, I am a watchman today. If I find a few fools like you... Sorry, sir. If I find customers like you... I will buy one such flat and be a top watchman, sir. Thank you, sir. I will leave. Oh my god! She is multi-talented. Darling... Who is he following our chick? What is it, man? You are following. Me? No way. Really? We've been watching you. Trust me, bro. I am not following you. I am following a girl. Let me show her. - Hey...! I am talking about the girl only. Oh, fish! I thought you meant I was following you. Yeah, bro. I am following that girl. Oi, do you know we've been on the waiting list? So, you also like the girl... Yeah. We've been following her before you. Awesome, bro. I like you. You look bad but you have great taste. This is the minimum following for talented girl like her. That's why I am following her. You shouldn't. Come on, bro. Did I ask you not to? You also follow her. Try your best. So, are you saying we will fail? No. I would never say that. Do you think you can? It's nothing for me, bro. Try saying it once. You will know what happens. Okay. My dear brothers... You can't follow that girl from today. Come on, bro... If I knew this was your language... Would you have beaten us? Sorry, bro. My slang in this language is too worse. Hey, do you still want to fight me? Okay, come on... Don't blame me for the pain. Hey, Bunty... Is your brain slow or what? He is giving you a review. How much would you rate my punch? 5! Whoo-hoo! He gave me 5 stars, man. You will see stars as I hit you. Get the bike while coming. They are really smart, man. You guys are fools. Hello, Miss... Isn't it a bit much? This is nothing in front of your talent. What's the matter? Goddess Saraswati has 4 arms and yet, she settled to one veena. But, you only have these two tiny arms. How are you so skilled, Miss? You are really great, Miss. My ambition is to have a cup of coffee with a celebrity like you. So, please... How do you know all this? Are you following me? Oh my!! I might be your greatest fan. But, I can't roam so much like you do. I wish to see you in the morning, chat in the evening and have a coffee in between. That'd be enough for this life. So, a cup of coffee with you... I am not having coffee with you. Get lost! She wouldn't be a celebrity if she isn't arrogant. Okay. Hey, stop... Go... Next... Go... Is nobody drunk? - No one, sir. Hey, stop... Shoot him! Oh, no! I am caught. Hello, sir... What's your name? Ramesh, sir... Say that again. Ramesh, sir... You go. Be louder. Ramesh, sir...! [POLICE SIREN] Stop it, man. The machine blasted like a cracker with your shout. It must be China material, sir. [POLICE SIREN] Now that it's proven, I surrender, sir. Hey...! You are smart, bro. Hope you do good. Take care. Bye, sir. Thank you. What are you staring at, idiot? By the way, why'd I pay 1000 when there's no slip? Have I paid more out of tension? He is fooling youth seeing I am drunk. Darling, I will be there in an hour. [POLICE SIREN] Shut up! I asked you to leave. Why are you back? Sir, stop looting us. Return 500 bucks out of the 1000. What the hell are you saying? I am seeking justice, sir. And what's that? Why should I pay 1000 bucks without a slip? Pay me back, sir. This is not right. This is not right at all. What are you staring at? Return 500 bucks to me. Just return it, I say. Come on... Hey, idiot! You give me a fake note and act silly in return. You scoundrel! Sir, I didn't know it was fake. Let's deal with this at the station. - Sir, it's my fault. I paid you 1000 bucks for 'drink n drive'. Compensating for the fake note and my nuisance... I will pay you 10,000 bucks in total. Take it. Turn it around. I did. Whoa! They are all fake notes. Hey...! How dare you pay fake notes? What do you think of police, eh? Trying to bribe us, huh? Okay. I will talk to the MRO. - Okay, sir. Who are you, girl? What do you want? Greetings, sir... - Hmm... I am Nandini. I don't know if you remember me. At the temple earlier... Yeah. I remember. I see you in Sundaram's apartment often. Yes, sir. I live there. I teach dance, music, veena, yoga... Tell me what the matter is. Sir, majority of my students are from this area. You know how far I stay from here. So, it would be convenient if I shifted here. Why are you telling me that? Sir, I know your penthouse is vacant. I mean... The open place on terrace will be of great help. Look... I didn't even hang a to-let board. I don't know who told you. The penthouse is not vacant. And I am not putting it up for rent. You know, sir... I said no, didn't I? I am running late. Is the driver ready? - Yes, sir. Hello... A cup of coffee... Listen... Even if you request or threaten me... I am not having coffee with you. I simply hate coffee. Oh, if you hate coffee, what about sugarcane juice? If I come across you ever again, trust me, I am going to call the cops. Why would cops have coffee with us? Please don't irritate me. How many times do I have to tell you? Please leave me alone. Please... Please... Please... Stop the car. Hey, boy... Nitin... Nitin... What a timing, man! Could you call him? Hey, he is calling you. I heard him. Ignore him. Forget it. - Nitin... He is an elderly man. Why don't you go? You would leave, right? I will stay. Go to him and come. Stay right here. I will be right back. Hmm... This isn't right. I should warn him strictly. Come on... Here I come. You are finished. Come, dear... Look who's here. Train star! Oh mighty one! You've tortured me enough with your affection. Bye. Dear... Not anymore. You and I are... What happened? You call me a good guy, eh? Yeah. I will turn into a terrorist. Your applause is killing me. Bye. Driver, start the car. Come on, sir... - What is this? Get in. Bro, start the car. Bye... Bye... Bye... Sir, you are respected by everyone. Did you need to be embarrassed by him? Do you know him? Mr. Reddy... He made me a hero. Does he like you? Like me? You know I am your crazy fan. He is a crazier fan of mine. I cut him off unable to take the love. Listen... If you act normal with him... Huh, if I do? I will have coffee with you every day. No chance. Your coffee... Coffee? Yes. Coffee indeed. Every day... Every... Day... O' God, I've been looking for you. You've proven to be right here. Thank you, lord. Aww... Sorry... Sorry... I will turn into a terrorist. You could've told me before, right? Why? I broke it off with him not knowing this. That's your problem. For our coffee relation to begin... You need to do me another favor. Superb. Tell me what the other favor is. I will help you. Get me Mr. Reddy's penthouse on rent. Deal! Bye. You linked it to the old man again. He is all alone. I should flatter him and get the penthouse. Stop right there. Aren't' you ashamed to enter my house again? You were dead to me since the moment you abandoned me. Oh my god! Old man seems to be deeply hurt. Sorry, sir. It was a mistake. You call that a mistake? It's ego. Recklessness... I didn't expect you to be so hurt, sir. You thought a sorry would fix everything, huh? You don't respect me or my words. Not at all. I have great respect for you. Respect? In that case, why would you embarrass me in public? Why would you marry against my will? Er... It just happened, sir. What? I married against your will? When? Yes. You denied me and got married. When my own blood betrayed me, I don't trust people anymore. Oh... All this is from being drunk. How'd I raise you? Mr. Reddy... Mr. Reddy... Who did you think I was? It's me, Nitin. - Huh? Who is it? It's me, sir. Nitin... Oh boy, it's you. I am sorry. It's okay. I always thought my grandson would be a great man like you. That is why I am excited every time I see you. I am your grandson. Huh? Assume I am. You will feel better. No... No... No way. I don't want any relations or affections. For the past 25 years, I have been all alone. Solo! When your own blood cheats you, it's really painful. Bloody blood! Why are you so furious? You said your family has been away for 25 years. You must have totally lost your anger for them. So, forgive them and... No! Sir, blood...! Huh? What the hell! There's no blood. There's no blood? How come? It's my blood, sir. Give me your hand. Careful. You got sentimental and injured me, old man. Sorry, boy. Who wants your sorry? To compensate this mistake of yours... Just rent me your penthouse. Penthouse, ah? Yeah. What's the link between this and that? I am asking it for another link. The link is Nandini. Nandini is that dance teacher, right? Yes. I need to impress that teacher. Why do you have to impress that teacher? Why do you care about all that? Will you rent it or not? You don't have to request me. It's done. Done? Done! Greetings, sir... She is my... Friend! Oh, is it? Listen, girl... Nitin's my only dear one in the world. He is younger to me but I respect him a lot. Why don't you tell her why? Nandini should know. What should I tell her? You know... What you tell everyone about me... What? You know, Mr. Reddy... My dialogues and action... Oh, it's all mere chatter, boy. Huh? Mere chatter? This is called sheer bad timing. You don't tell the right people. Look, dear... The penthouse is yours from today. Do what you have to. Hey, give her the keys. - Okay, sir. All right, son? - Hmm... What a charm!

You go to a coffee shop and have it. As I have to pay the bill... You gave me this hundred. Yeah. Hold this for me, please. Hmm... It's an offering inside the temple. It's alms outside the temple. Sorry, my friend. My foot! Why would I ask you if I had to go alone? My mom's coffee is the best in the world. He can get her home by evening if he wants to. Challenge? Challenge!

Guys, continue. - Okay, Master. Are you joining directly, bro? Hey, that girl... Which girl? Oh, that girl... She's my new student. She's coming since a week. - One week, ah? Why do you ask? It's nothing. You go. Okay. Come on... Okay, ready. One... Two... Three... O' Lord! What a miracle! So, she is pasting what she copied. Hey, what are you doing here? What are you looking at?

Who are you, dear? I am here for Nitin. He's my son. I am here to meet him. She must be the girl from the temple. Go call brother. Come on, dear. Be seated. She must be the girl from the temple. Yay! Bro... Bro... Get up. Come on... What is it? There's a surprise for you. Come on, bro... Come on... He has finally done it. He brought her home like he said. What'd you think, huh? He is my son after all. Why are they all zipped up? Who is it? Oh, it's you. Why'd you come so early? What? Didn't you invite her home? Do you think I am so jobless? What is it, huh? 'Am I over doing it?' Oh, yeah... I remember. I just told her randomly that your coffee tastes great. She must be here to taste it. Am I right? Damn! I didn't even offer coffee. I'll get it in 2 minutes. - Oh, no! I simply hate coffee. Come on... You just don't want to trouble my mom. It's okay. Have it. No! Mom, get her a great coffee. Okay, people. I have to go back to sleep. You have the coffee and leave. And, don't call me the entire day, please. That's because I am a bit busy. Oh, sorry... I am really busy. Bye... Hey... Hey... Stop. She came home for the first time. Is this how you behave with her? Mister Daddy, I understand your vibrations. Only if she endures such conduct... She can be your daughter-in-law. Okay? So, let's see. Have it, dear. Is my coffee that good, dear? Shall I get another mug? Don't laugh. I am really angry. [PHONE BUZZING] He is dead. What? Ready to be home at the same time tomorrow? I am not coming. Oi, you promised two days. If you aren't ready, I will go to Mr. Reddy. I will come. Good girl. Bye... I will come indeed. Yay! Good morning, everybody! Good morning...! Why is she sounding different? Hi... She must have really loved my coffee. She is home so early. Let me get you a coffee, dear. Oh, no, auntie! I can't have coffee or water for that matter. I am on a fast. Kavya... - Huh? Wake up Nitin. Don't wake him up, uncle. I am here to spend time with all of you. Oh my!! Something seems wrong. Are you coming from a temple, dear? Yes, auntie. I was tying a loincloth to Nitin last time and he got so worked up. What? Why are you back again? I didn't come for you, idiot. Go to sleep. Idiot, ah? Don't come here. Go to sleep. How dare you call me an idiot? I didn't ask you to come here. Don't you hear me? Go to sleep. How are you putting up with such a lazy bum? Lazy bum? Wow! Dad cusses him similarly. Don't just cuss him, uncle. Even buffaloes are set straight with a few beatings. He is nothing. Okay, forget it. Wow! Something smells great. Is it tamarind rice? My wife cooks that one dish well. She cooks all dishes well. Really? I love tamarind rice. Wait, dear. I will get it. Thanks, auntie. You said you were fasting. So what? I will pack you a box. Eat it once as you break your fast. [PHONE BUZZING] One minute... Hello... Hey, why are you over acting? Weren't you over acting yesterday? Our deal was just to visit your place. My behavior here is up to me. I will tell Mr. Reddy. Please do that. I will be totally rid of you. I am bearing you for the flat's sake. Take the flat and Mr. Reddy away from me... And I will wave you goodbye forever. I didn't recognize that point. Bye, auntie. Don't forget to eat the tamarind rice. - Sure, uncle. I am rid of him since today. [UPBEAT HINDI SONG PLAYING] Nandini... Sir... You seem to be dancing joyfully. Wow! Tamarind rice! The smell makes my mouth water. Did you make it? Yeah. Want to have some? Why not? I really love tamarind rice. But, it never tasted so delicious. Dear, you reminded me of my mom. Daily... Not daily... Will you make it for me once in a while? Did you have it? Yeah. I will... Make it tomorrow if possible. With the same taste, please. Same taste, ah? Do I have to go to his place again? [DOOR KNOCK] Why'd she come without an invite? Has she fallen for me or what? Why are you back again? Why? Shouldn't I come?

Add the seasoning and... Auntie, one minute... Love you, boss. Excellent! What a great artist! No way. He only draws this. That's because he is crazy about Power Star. Yet, how could he draw so perfectly? When you are madly in love, that's how you draw. Excuse me, sir... Tell me. Sir, your coupon won the Europe trip from our company. Hooray! We are flying to Europe. Hey, what's this? We mentioned three names in the coupon. It shows only our two names. Where's Nitin's ticket? Sorry, ma'am. It was a technical error. Nitin's ticket will be confirmed in the next 4 days. How could you do that? We would've travelled together otherwise. Sorry, sir. It's okay, Mr. Reddy. Let's tease Nitin for fun. Let's fly to Europe without telling him. Let's tease him for 3 days and then handover the ticket. He will come to us. You love teasing Nitin, don't you? Looks like Dhanya's car. The stole is out. Darling must be inside. Let me follow and surprise her. Nandini... Sorry? Oh, sorry... - It's okay. Hey, who is she? Who are you, sir? Who are you, man? Where's Nandini? - Who is that? Isn't it her friend Dhanya's car? This is the hotel's travel car. Hotel's travel car? Yeah, sir. Dhanya ma'am rented the car until today morning. Rented it? - Yes, sir. We take their passports and rent the cars for self-driving. What passports? Ms. Dhanya and Ms. Nandini stayed in our Presidential Suite for a month now. Nandini ma'am would be out mostly. They are both European citizens from Barcelona. They checked out today and flew to Europe. 'The number you are calling is currently switched off.' 'Please call again later.' You ask like you don't know. You only took the lucky draw. I was asked to give you the ticket after 3 days. But, I am leaving to my hometown. So, here it is. The trip was after 2 months. I don't know. They are at the airport already. Airport, ah? Hey, have you locked everything? Yeah, sir. It's after two months. You were here when the coupon was filled. What about this ticket? Sir, these are dummy tickets. We didn't issue tickets to anyone. Sorry, Nitin. Nandini and Mr. Reddy already boarded. Even the announcement is made. Flight is on the runway to take off. See you. Hi... Nandu... Mommy... Nandini... - Hi, dad... Missed you, dear. I've dropped pounds without your food there. Stop chattering. You've been on this tour for so long. Your wedding is in 10 days. You have landed now coolly. I am here, aren't I? All right. Talk to Chaitanya and his parents first. Stay in touch with your fiancé and future in-laws. Sure, mom. Kittu... Hey, Kittu... Stop. Hey, Kittu... - Uncle... Uncle... Kittu, stop. - Don't give this to anyone. Bro, did Kittu come this way? He gave me this. You see how smart he is? This is Nandini's pen. She is so careful about it. A drive pen is really expensive, so... What's a drive pen? It's just a pen. Come on... It's not just a pen. It has an in-built pen drive. Whatever you write with this is saved in the pen drive. All right. You give it to Nandini. Hmm... Take it. I spoke to grandpa at the temple for the first time. But, my plan didn't work out. He scolded me and left. I am not upset he yelled at me. I am happy I spoke to him for the first time. But, I don't know how to get close to grandpa. Mom, do you know what I got for you from India? Ta-da! Hey! These dolls are made in our village. How'd you find it? I bought it from a shop. Why, mom? This reminds me of my dad. Shame! I am embarrassed to say you are my daughter. I sent you to the city to study. You are acting foolish in the name of love and marriage. I didn't get married, dad. I didn't fall in love too. Arun just expressed his love for me. He is here to talk to you respectfully. I already promised your aunt. There will be no discussions now. I will convince auntie, dad. How will you convince her? We always wanted to marry you to Bujji. Marrying cousins is not at all good, dad. Science says the kids are in grieve danger. Oh... Ever heard this? She says marrying cousins isn't good. Weren't our parents cousins? Weren't your parents cousins? Forget them. Aren't we cousins? Mom has a liver ailment, dad. Even I have asthma. It will be worse for the next generation. Get out! Dad? - Get out! Get out I say. Dad... Dad... Don't call me that. Get lost. Listen to me. - Shut up. You insulted us in public blaming us for your disease. That alone is enough for us to consider you dead. Get lost! Even when mom died and you were born... He didn't let us in. Don't be sad, mom. Nandu... I brought grandpa along. I will unite you two soon. How is it? It's good, mom. It's your dad's surprise gift. Congrats, mom. Wait on... This isn't for me. It's for my future daughter-in-law. It's for your future wife. Our entire family is glowing in Nandini's presence. She rightly suits us and our personalities. You can know that from her face, son. She really loves you and respects us. [DJ PLAYING] Wow! We've been managing quite well since 3 days. My wedding is in a week. I will directly take him to the venue that day... And get grandpa to meet mom. Everything will be sorted. Superb plan! But, we managed Nitin quite well too. Oh my!! He and his family are over sentimental. How can they be such emotional fools? His love and their over affections... Ugh! I couldn't take it. They must be shocked as I vanished suddenly. What's wrong? I thought it was him. No way. He would never come this far. Hey, where's grandpa? Where'd he go? Hey, look over there. Grandpa...?! - Grandpa indeed. It's okay. Hey, boy...! You are here. Mr. Reddy...! - We missed you. ♪Your sparkly eyes worked their charm♪ ♪They made my heart go crazy for you♪ ♪I shall torture you for every action of yours♪ ♪I will crush you hard♪ ♪You have nowhere to go♪ ♪I will torture you wherever you are♪ ♪Watch me rebel in your style♪ ♪Scream all you want♪ ♪I'll show no mercy♪ ♪Why are you in a hurry, girl?♪ ♪You have filled my life with darkness♪ ♪You killed my heart♪ ♪You troubled me like hell♪ ♪You killed my heart♪ ♪You troubled me like hell♪ ♪You killed my heart♪ ♪You troubled me like hell♪ ♪You thought it was no big deal♪ ♪You abandoned my heart midway♪ ♪There's no way I am leaving you♪ ♪You have stabbed my heart hard♪ ♪Shall I do the same to you?♪ ♪I shall torture you for every action of yours♪ ♪You vanished like a spark of light♪ ♪How could you cheat me, girl?♪ ♪You killed my heart♪ ♪You troubled me like hell♪ ♪You killed my heart♪ ♪You troubled me like hell♪ ♪You killed my heart♪ ♪You troubled me like hell♪ Where's grandpa? He's dead in my hands today. If I don't have him locked up and smacked... I am not Nandini. Welcome, girls! Welcome! What is he doing here? - Hey, why are you here? It's obvious you will come here. So, I came early and waited for you. Welcome! Sir, I was actually talking to you about these two girls. And I just found them. - Fine. Thank you. It's nothing. I told him we were tourists. We lost our way and found each other again. Come, let's sit and talk. I am not here to have a chat with you. Where's Mr. Reddy? He's your grandpa, right? I kidnapped him. Where is he? It wouldn't be a kidnap if I told you. Fine. I will make the cops ask you. Sure. Your grandpa will tell the truth then. 'It was no kidnap. I only followed him here.' And, he will get to know you are his granddaughter. You are in a police station talking about a kidnap. That shows you have a sharp plan at the ready. When you are well planned for making a mistake... I need to be better planned for teaching you a lesson. I made no mistake. I wanted to unite my grandpa and mom. If you told me when you met me... If I did... Would you unite me and my grandpa? I don't know. But, I wouldn't have chased you. I wouldn't have wasted my time and emotions. You also fooled my parents in the name of trust. I am sorry. Huh? What? Sorry, ah? I would've accepted it if you came to me. But, you are apologizing after I came to you. What's in a sorry anyways? You say it so simply. I cannot see it. It's a feeling. What? A feeling? Who has to feel it amongst us two? You should feel that I am sorry. But, I should feel it here, right? Oh... So, do I have to love you now? Love, ah? Shame! You can never set a broken heart straight. You can spell love but don't know what it means. I don't want you or your love. I want to leave you right away. But, how? There's no peace unless my heart is satisfied. What do you want me to do now? I should feel that you are really sorry. Or else, I will take your grandpa to India. Hey, how do I do that? Through incidents... Like there are 5 letters in your sorry... Make me feel you are sorry through 5 incidents. If I felt you are sorry in the first incident... I will hand over your grandpa and go my way. If not, forget about your grandpa. I can find grandpa meanwhile. Okay. I am ready. Very good. Let's begin. 'S' is the first alphabet in sorry. What could you do for me that starts with 'S'? 'Se...' 'Service!' 'Service!' - Service? Yes. Service... You are dead once I find my grandpa. How would I serve you at the church? I don't get it. This church runs a charity and helps the needy. I want to give them a donation. That's through you. Follow me. What do I have to do for that? I will make paintings. You have to sell them. Sell them? I can't do it. Come on, girl. I've seen your talent in India. You'd sell the sky if it was possible. Come on now... Get to work. Do you know how to paint? I don't have to know. What will you paint then? I am already done, girl. What is this? Don't you get the meaning? Does it mean anything? Hooray! Yes! I can also do modern art now. Modern art is something you don't understand. Sell this, impress me and take your grandpa. You fool! Who would buy this? Hello... You want this beautiful painting? - No... No... No? Okay. - No! Sir... - What? You want this great painting? What the hell is that? Just go away. He was going to kill me. Bloody painting! Hooray! I did it! I sold it. I earned 100 Euros. Let's donate this. Like my service? I thought my painting wouldn't sell for 10 Euros. But, you sold it for 100. - Yes. Is my art so valuable? - Yes. What if I painted 20 more? - 20? Watch me now. I will kill it with both my hands. You can sell it for 200 Euros. Yeah. Look there. Karma! What the hell! Hey, what are you saying? Will you buy all his paintings? I have no option. He is torturing me. Do something. Send all our friends here with money. Ask them to buy all the paintings. He shouldn't doubt they are my friends. Hmm... Okay. Welcome! Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! Please have a look at these beautiful paintings. What is this painting? This is India's most beautiful monument. It's Taj Mahal. Taj Mahal? Where is it? Before construction... Wow! Now, look at this. These are the twin towers of New York city. The World Trade Centre... Where's the building? After the flight crash... Wow! What's the price of all the paintings? Very expensive! 500 Euros... Hey, that's nothing. 500 Euros is nothing? Watch me. Hello... Hello... 500 Euros for not all the paintings. 500 Euros for one painting. Isn't this a bit much? Hello... It's for donation. Sell them. Who is he? Why is he bringing the painting? Don't come here, man. Oh... He bought my first painting. Thanks for buying my painting, sir. I didn't buy it. I found it there. He says he found it? In the trash box... In the dust bin? As a painter, I can tell you that you have a very unique style. He is crazy. There's nothing unique about it. But, my child, why'd you throw it there? Hey, did you dump my painting? How dare you? You fooled me with a 100 Euros, eh? Are they here to really buy? Are you her friends? No. Do you know her? No. Her name is Nandini, no? No. How do you know? Hey, wait... They said that's not my name. When they don't know you... How'd they know that's not your name? Playing games, eh? Damn it! Forget about your grandpa now. Nitin... Nitin... - I am flying to India with him. Goodbye. Please wait, man. Nitin... Good pair. Sorry, Nitin. Sorry... Don't say sorry again. One chance, please... One chance... 'S' in sorry failed. Try something with 'O'. Oh... You are throwing ideas at me now? Hmm... Go for 'O' because 'S' failed? Shall I go to 'R', 'R' and Y' if 'O' fails? - Sure. What the hell! This is your penalty for cheating. I am cancelling 'R', 'R' and 'Y'. You only have 'O' left. 'O' for outing. Outing, ah? Don't play tricks and come alone. Tomorrow morning... Tomorrow morning... Hey, what'd you say? Uh-huh... I wonder where he'd take you and what he'd do. Don't make me panic. I can't take anyone of you as he saw you guys. He saw everyone but one. We should enter Rahul during times of panic. Come on... He conditioned me to come alone. No problem. Rahul will take care of everything. Rahul...! [PHONE BUZZING] Answer my call. Aren't you right in front of me? Don't underestimate the power of a common man. Rahul does everything with proper planning. Hold my call on line. I will hear your entire conversation. I will follow you guys. Superb, Rahul! 'It isn't over yet, my love.' Get into the car. I will follow you. Okay. Attack! Don't come too close. He will get suspicious. You are too scared. You don't know him. He doesn't know me too. Don't underestimate the power of a common man. Rahul... Rahul... Tell me. It's him. I am turning my speaker off. Go ahead. I just have to hear you two. Okay. Who is it in the car behind? Which car? Who is it? Who? Some car and some fool... Why do you panic like you arranged him? Don't say that, bro. I almost wet my pants here. You aren't using your brains, are you? No. I left them at home. If you joke without my permission, I will not laugh. I will eat you up. This one's a good joke. Come on, move... Is that car following us? No. I mean, I don't know. Okay. Why am I following them anyway? I can hear them, right? Let me take over. Wow! You see... He left. Is your doubt clarified? It isn't clarified. It's glorified now. Oh my god! There are 4 roads ahead. Which way do I go? Good girl! Tell her, man. You'd go crazy thinking who's following who. Take right. Okay, right... Very smart. No. Go left. Left... Whatever you say, darling. He is moving in the direction I say. You are being over smart, bro. Oh, I see. You are managing through the phone. Nandini, this route isn't that exciting. Go straight and take a U-turn. Make it fast. U-turn? You think you own this road? You are saying things suddenly. Nandini, go right now. Right, ah? Hey... Hey... Hey... This is Barcelona, man. Not Bheemavaram. I need to go 2 kilometres now. What's wrong? I want water. Who should be serving who? Please... Please... Please... Just this once. All right. Where are you? I am behind your trunk. Where exactly? Turn around. Don't underestimate the power of a common man. I am coming. Wait there. I will park the car behind the bus. Where are you coming? What? You will suffocate to death if you hide in the trunk. Don't underestimate the power of a common man. If I blocked the trunk with my jacket... There's no way he'd know. Put the trunk up. I will hide in the trunk and find your grandpa. Here you go. May I drive? Okay. Superb! Damn! There's dust. Hey, cloth... Oh my!! He saw the cloth. Is he going to pull it or what? You idiot! Don't underestimate the power of a common man. I have asthma, man. Drive slowly. Okay. He doesn't know I am in the trunk. Do you have to drive so fast? Go slow. Hey... Don't underestimate the power of a common man. Oh my god! Slow down. I am here to keep an eye on you. But, you are suffocating me in the trunk. Please stop. I am begging you. He is driving through pits even in foreign. Please stop. I am begging you. I will die from shortage of breath. Please stop. I am begging you. All my parts are shaking, man. Oh my god! Stop! What is it? Nandini... Who is he? My uncle... Uncle, ah? Damn it. People usually behave weird when drunk. But, he hides in the trunk when he boozes. In the trunk, eh? I pity you, uncle. I check the trunk every day before going out. I missed it today. Calm down, uncle. What have you done, girl? Were you sleeping in the trunk, uncle? Hey... The car...! My car...! Hey, you... Stop! Hello... Hey... Call the cops. With what? Phone and wallet are in the car. What do we do now? What is he saying? He is asking the same thing. Hey, the car... Let's go. Hey, the keys... Don't you use your brains? You are just barging in. We stole a superb car, didn't we? Shailu... Hey, Shailu... Hey, come here. What, Shalu? You forgot the keys like it's our car. Sorry, Shailu. I forget myself when I look at you. You naughty...! Keys... Let's go. - Okay. Car keys are in the car. I see. If you act smart one more time... Okay. Rahul, I will go get the car keys. Hey, men should do such risky stuff. Only I should go then. Hey... Don't underestimate the power of a common man. I am also a man. I will also come. Common man, my foot! Stay here. I will go. You stay back. Stop... Gay pub, ah? Mr. Common Man... ou are the perfect man. Go... You wanted to go first. Go ahead... All right. Let's go together. Come on... I am not coming. Take Nandini. Have you gone blind? Look... The board reads 'Ladies and Gents aren't allowed'. Gay couples can enter. That's why we should go together. Come on... Nandini, wait right here. Okay? Hmm... Come on... Stop! Oh... Can we go inside? No. This is strictly for gays. But, we are gays. No. You are not. Bloody woman! She found out. Let's leave. But, you can go inside. Me? - Yeah. I can make out that you are gay Nachimi. But, he is not. I am gay Nachimi? Yeah. Go inside. Alone? - Yeah, alone. If I go alone, they will make me Sunny Leone. Wait on... Everything has a price. But, we have no cash on us. There's cash on your body. - What's that? This... Now, can we go inside? Both of you can get in. - Thank you. Excuse me... Wow! She's amaze! Oh god, Shalu! What is it, dear? Your Shailu is here and you are staring at girls. Are you okay now? If she is so hot, her brother must be hotter. Am I right? Wow! Hey, there they are. Shalu... We found them. Smack them up and get the car key. We can't fight them here. There's two of us. There's so many of them. If they realize we are men, they will share us. What do we do now? This... Wow! We've got an Indian babe. DJ, play Indian numbers. Dance and impress them. [INDIAN NUMBERS PLAYING] Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay! Come on... Shall we go on a long drive in our new car? I will come only if you let me drive. Sure, man. You are really romantic. - Am I? Darling, what's the problem? Car isn't starting. Could you get down and push? - Oh, sure. Let's go. Come on... Ready? - Come on, start... Push! Push! Oh my god! They can't do it. Why don't you lend a hand? Oh, okay. We are wasting time. Let's push quickly. Come on... - Hey... Push the car not me. Come here, please... Come... - Naughty... Push. That's it. Very good. Hey, cheaters... Come fast. Right. - Yes! Bye... I can't hold it anymore. Stop. Nandini... Huh? I am flying to India tomorrow. I can feel you are sorry. You were silly with the paintings. But since morning, you've been pretty decent. Do I know why I asked you for an outing today? It's to unite you and your grandpa. - What? Your grandpa is right here. Where? He's in that room. Go... Thank you, Nitin. Take him. Mr. Reddy... I am not wearing any underpants. A lie for a minute hurts you so much. But, you've been cheating me since we met. Wouldn't I be hurt badly? Well served! Hey, Nandini... Why are you drinking raw? He is torturing me. I want to shoot him. Gun... I want a gun. - Where do I get it from? If I had a gun, I'd shoot him right now. Relax! Thank god it's a bottle. What if it was really a gun? Having fun, boys? Who are you? ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪Hey, Rangeela...♪ ♪Hey, Rangeela...♪ ♪Hey, Mexican Rangeela...♪ ♪Don't fire like a shot gun♪ ♪Settle down with me♪ ♪With a spicy tequila♪ ♪Shall I do a shots up?♪ ♪Don't say goodbye yet♪ ♪Don't detest me♪ ♪Dance along with me♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪Don't risk it with me♪ ♪I will set your attitude straight♪ ♪As you surround me like a cowboy♪ ♪I will suppress your head weight♪ ♪Don't sit merely♪ ♪Let's break boundaries♪ ♪I shall make you scream, girl♪ ♪I will tempt you like pepperoni pizza♪ ♪You can't have me ever♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪Let's go to a disco♪ ♪Do whatever with me♪ ♪I give you all my rights♪ ♪Shut your mouth♪ ♪Mind your business♪ ♪Don't show off♪ ♪I will parcel you to Mars♪ ♪You act like a tigress♪ ♪You are uttering dialogues♪ ♪Take your words back♪ ♪Run away from me♪ ♪In my race of life♪ ♪No horse wins me over♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ ♪O' my girl...♪ Nitin...

He has gone out. That's okay. Is there anyone else staying in the room right now? Mr. Raghuveera Reddy is staying here. What? You found grandpa's address? Yes. I am going there right now. Go home urgently and send my parents to Lord Balaji's temple. You don't come. Send Sandy. Hey, why are you confusing me? We were going to unite them at the wedding. It will be a disaster if we wait anymore. We should do it today to be rid of that rascal. Okay, yeah. Taxi... Mr. Reddy... Good morning, Mr. Reddy... - Hey, Nandini... Where were you? Get in. Yes! Get ready urgently. I have a surprise for you. What's the surprise? Why are you look dull? Where's Nitin? Nitin is on the way. Let's go first. Tell me where. You like Lord Balaji, right? There's a fantastic temple here. I will take you there. Oh, very good. But, let Nitin join us. He will be here. Call him up once. It's not connecting from my phone. Where's Nitin by the way? Nitin... Nitin... Nitin... You are always asking about him. Do you know how idiotic he is? Because you pamper him so much... He has... Tom and Jerry are back to fighting, eh? What's your problem with him anyways? Mr. Reddy, let's go to the temple first. I will tell you everything later. Why aren't they here yet? Thanks, dear. You brought me to a nice temple. I feel so peaceful. That is why I chose this place to reunite you and mom. Mr. Reddy... Mr. Reddy... - Come on, dear. Let's leave. Mr. Reddy, stop. What happened? Shame! The face I never wanted to see again... If I knew she was staying here... I wouldn't have come to this country. Wait... What happened? What happened? I consider my daughter dead since 25 years. She is back in my life again. I will not stay in the place they live. You visit the Lord and come. I am leaving. I cannot stay here anymore. I need to fly to India as soon as possible. Nandini... Why'd you leave suddenly? I've been calling you. It's not connecting. I called Dhanya and she said you were here. Do you know how tensed I was? What even happened? You were saved in the fight last night. What happened? Don't you remember what happened last night? Hey... - Nandini... I will kill him. - Relax, Nandini... Stupid! - What? Help me. - Okay. I want to kill him. - Leave her... Hey! Nandini... Will you hit me for touching her? I will kiss her right in front of you now. What will you do, man? Hey... You are raged because we touched her. I will kill her now. What the hell can you do? Nitin, let's go to the hospital. I will be fine. Take Nandini first. Listen to me. Just go. Sorry, Nandini. I came to save you but was of no help. Nitin was assumed to be problem. But, he saved your honor and life. I have always been cheating you. Maybe that is why nothing is in my favor. I clearly understood grandpa wouldn't accept mom or me. Do you know why you didn't feel I was sorry? It's because I never felt sorry when it came to you. I always wanted to impress grandpa... Get him here for my wedding and reunite him and mom. But, I have nothing to lose now. I don't have to worry about grandpa, mom or you. But, here's a shocking fact. After it's all over, I am feeling sorry in your context. Realizing what I put you and your family through... I am really feeling sorry. I want to make you understand that. My wedding is in 3 days. If you stay at my place until then... I will make you feel I am sorry. Please... Please don't say no. Hmm... Thank you. I will settle the bill and come. Where is she going? Hey, Nandini just came and left. She is playing some new drama. I've been trying to ruin her wedding since I came here. She herself invited me home now. I will give her a shocker now. Bye... Oh my!! Nandini, Nitin came here to ruin your wedding. Don't let him come home. I don't believe you. I heard him. I will not believe anyone anymore. If he wanted to ruin my life... He wouldn't risk his life to save me. Got it? Go get your car. "Is this pre-destined?" "What happened to me?" "Memories don't fade" "Am I falling in love?" "Glances speak a thousand words" "You flourish in my thoughts now" "How do I express it directly?" "My vision for you had changed" "You seem unique amongst all" "Distance prolongs and time melts" "Do you read my silence?" "When a shadow caressed me" "I assume it to be yours" "My love awaits you" "You are fun and frolic" "You are my celebration" "You fill up my daydreams" "Do I bloom like a flower?" "Do I hug you like a pillow?" "Do I accompany you for life?" "Do I give way?" "Do I halt you?" "Teach me the way to go" Dad... Dad... Nandini is nobody but your granddaughter. 'Sir, please don't say no.' To unite you and your daughter... Nandini came to India and grew close to you. Sir, I know your penthouse is vacant. She worked real hard to get you here. Hooray! We are flying to Europe. But, Nitin took advantage, blackmailing and torturing her. Where's Mr. Reddy? He's your grandpa, right? I kidnapped him. He is trying to ruin her wedding now. I've been trying to ruin her wedding since I came here. She herself invited me home now. It's okay if you don't meet your daughter. But, don't be the reason behind ruining your granddaughter's life. I considered you my grandson due to your conduct. How could you cheat me? She is trying to unite me with my daughter. But, you distanced me, blackmailed her and tried to ruin her life. Shame! You call yourself human? I couldn't notice her pain and your cruelty until he told me. How could you fool me? There are disputes in a family. You should try sorting things for us. But, if you take advantage and play with lives... You thought no one would react? Listen to me now. Nandini is my granddaughter. She is my daughter. This is my family. If you mess with my family, I will bury you dead. Get lost! Never show us your face again. Get lost! Scoundrel! My fury makes me want to kill you. Just because I met my family after so long... I am letting you live. Or else... You can meet your family, man. Who's stopping you? Hey, Lord... It's you who made me frank. I can't hold it in anymore. As per my plan, I should leave once my work is done. I was leaving shut too. But, in the process of lecturing me... You are imagining yourself as some saint. I feel too heated up. Your words struck me hard. Let me talk a little. Sir, you feel sorry for your granddaughter. Aren't you to be blamed for her situation? Rascal! How dare you question me? If my question flares you up, it's ego. If you think about it, you will see the truth. Just because I behaved like a rascal... And took advantage of you... You got furious and claimed them as your daughter and granddaughter. Suppose I explained their efforts and pain to you.. And asked you to reunite with them, would you? You wounded my hands when this topic came up, remember? Silence! All right. I'll give you a break and go to your daughter. Miss... Daughter of Reddy... If you convinced your dad after all these years... Do you believe he will melt down? There's silence here too. Let me come to your granddaughter now. Nandini, you tell me. The reason you played with everyone's emotions... And let me fool around with yours. Isn't it his stubbornness, foolishness and anger? Come on... Is it 50-50? Dial-a-friend? Or Audience Poll? Give me an answer. Silence! You all understand this silence, right? The problem is... We are bored with a peaceful life. That is why we fight and part ways in the name of ego. And when someone tries to unite us, we fight more. But, if someone interferes, that's when unity comes into play. Yes. This is proof. Mr. Reddy... You remember our first meeting? Same technique used in the train... I turned a thief over there. I framed myself as a rascal here. I teased Nandini and let you know through him. Watch what finally happened. You are all one family. I am now a stranger. Nandini, there's nothing wrong in wanting to unite mom and grandpa. But, what got me worked up is... Instead of bothering about your grandpa's nature... You made random plans and played with everyone's emotions. Do you have a family alone? We do too, right? Wouldn't I get furious? Finally, I only have two options. One is to cry in India. Two is to make you cry here. I am not the kind to cry. It's a birth defect, you see. Teasing is was the after effect. Oh... When you came here to tease her... Why'd you defame yourself to unite the family? When you were easily fooled in the hospital... I considered you a fool. But, you asked a brilliant question. That's me. But, the problem is... I don't' answer when I like the question. I will answer if I am annoyed. So, you still love Nandini. This is the question that annoys me. So, I will answer it. I hate her! I hate her! I hate her! 'I hate her! I hate her! I hate her! ' Hi, dear... Nice to see you. Do you recognize me? Sorry. I met you at this church last week. With the painting... Where's your boyfriend? He's not my lover. He hates me. What are you saying? He hates you? - Yes. No way. Something is wrong. Come with me. This is my personal art gallery. As an artist, I collect wonderful paintings from all over the world. I have a few unclaimed paintings along with the famous ones. Notice these paintings and you will see a specialty. You can see it for yourself. 'Yet, how could he draw so perfectly?' 'When you are madly in love, that's how you draw.' Yes, ma'am? Is Mr. Nitin there in room no. 1002? I am sorry. He just checked out. I cheated you. Why'd you still do all this for me? I don't know what you did. But, I loved you. There are no expectations in love. There's only giving. Love is all about giving. I came here to complete what you couldn't. That's all. If you really spread love... Why'd you say you hate me? When you didn't believe I loved you... Why'd you believe I hated you? Because I love you. I love you! I love you...! Why'd I call you home from the hospital? I started loving you unknowingly. I left everything behind for you. That's how much my love grew. I love you. Let's go. Oi, go get my bag. Me? Yeah, go. Come on... I am going to be your husband. Learn to serve me. Come fast. Hey, you...! We need to reach India urgently. Why? Because my boss's film 'Gopala Gopala' is releasing for the festival. We need to watch it in my hometown urgently. ♪Don't pull my cheeks and run away, sweetheart♪ ♪Let our story unfold♪ ♪My eyes are set on you♪ ♪I am in love with your smile♪ ♪Shall I surrender you my life?♪ ♪It's all for you, pretty girl♪ ♪It's all for you, pretty girl♪ ♪Don't you poke my heart and slip away, jasmine♪ ♪You are everything hereafter♪ ♪You are the newest desire♪ ♪You are like a spicy pickle♪ ♪Shall I hum a new song for you?♪ ♪It's all for you, pretty girl♪ ♪It's all for you, pretty girl♪ [SUBTITLES BY TITLES MEDIA]
