BUT, ANYWAY, ON ONE OF THEIR PAGES, IT SAID IF A VAMPIRE TASTES YOUR BLOOD, THEY'RE, LIKE, IN YOU, AND YOU DO VAMPIRE THINGS AND WANT VAMPIRE THINGS. AND YOU KNOW YOU SAID-- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT WHAT DID IT SAY ABOUT LIGHT? DID IT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHY IT BURNS 'EM? IT'S THE ULTRAVIOLET, THE U.V. IT'S LIKE A TANNING BOOTH. ALL FLUORESCENTS HAVE A LOT OF IT, AND SUNLIGHT. BUT NOT REGULAR LIGHT BULBS? NOPE. DON'T HURT 'EM. LET'S GO. YOU SEE ANYTHING? NAH. YOU? NAH. REMEMBER, VALENTINE WILL PROTECT US, BUT THE OTHERS... WE SEE THE OTHERS, WE RUN, RIGHT? RIGHT. WHAT? I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING. IT'S PROBABLY A RAT. ARE THERE LITTLE MIDGET VAMPIRES? OR... THIS IS JUST A THOUGHT, BUT DO BATS BECOME VAMPIRES? NAH. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SO. MAYBE. LET'S GO. SHH! WHAT? OVER THERE. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. I DON'T, EITHER. WHAT DO WE DO? GO ON, I GUESS. HARV. HOWDY, ZACH. J.T. WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE? I MEAN, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? MR. CHAN'S BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOU. JUST TAKING A BREAK. EVEN GUYS LIKE ME NEED A VACATION SOMETIMES. UH... DID YOU SEE GABE COME DOWN HERE? GABE? YEAH. GREAT. WELL, WHEN DID SHE COME THROUGH? WHERE DID SHE GO? SHE'S WITH VALENTINE. GOOD. HE'LL PROTECT HER. VALENTINE? YEAH. HE DOESN'T LIKE HUMAN BLOOD. WHO TOLD YOU THAT? HE DID. AND YOU BELIEVED HIM? ( laughing ) HARV, IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT TELLING US? COULD BE. WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT IT OVER LUNCH? JOIN ME FOR A BITE? RUN, ZACH! ( Harv growling ) AHH! AHH! ZACH! OH, NO! GOTCHA! I'M YOUR FRIEND! ZACH, YOU'RE MY LUNCH! AAAHHHH! I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. THAT WAS CLOSE! I DON'T NEVER WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. IT'S ALL MY FAULT SHE'S DOWN THERE. IF I WASN'T SO MEAN TO HER, SHE WOULD HAVE NEVER TOOK THOSE PICTURES. AND IF WE DIDN'T CARE, WE WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO SAVE HER, BUT SHE DID, AND WE DO, AND WE WILL. SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? JUST GO BACK DOWN THERE, WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TUNNELS? NO. VALENTINE'S GOT HER, AND I THINK I KNOW WHERE. CAN WE GET THERE BY SUNLIGHT? I ONLY KNOW ONE WAY. ZACH? WHAT? HOW LONG WE BEEN DOWN HERE? I-I DON'T KNOW. A LONG TIME. LIKE, A COUPLE OF HOURS? AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HOURS. YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING? YEAH. YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING? ABSOLUTELY. OKAY, ZACH. WHAT? YOU'RE NOT LYING AGAIN, ARE YOU? I MEAN, I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU-- YES! I'M LYING, ALL RIGHT? WE'RE LOST. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. WE'RE GONNA WANDER AROUND DOWN HERE UNTIL WE STARVE TO DEATH OR THE RATS EAT US, OR UNTIL HARV OR SIMS OR ONE OF THE OTHER VAMPIRES FINDS US AND FANGS US, AND WE JOIN THE UNDEAD FOREVER! YOU HAPPY NOW?! AS LONG AS YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. ( Zach scoffs ) LOOK! THERE SHE IS. ZACH! MMM. ZACHARY AND HIS LITTLE FRIEND. WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. LET HER GO, VALENTINE. TAKE ME INSTEAD. WE DON'T BARGAIN WITH THE LIVING. WHY SHOULD WE LET ANY OF YOU GO? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T DRINK HUMAN BLOOD. I LIED. ( laughter ) ZACHARY, I'M A VAMPIRE. DRINKING HUMAN BLOOD IS MY NATURE. I WARNED YOU. I TOLD YOU: TRUST NO ONE. I EVEN GAVE YOU A CLUE. WHAT CLUE? WELL, I STARTED THIS LITTLE FAMILY. NOW, HOW COULD I DO THAT WITHOUT DRINKING HUMAN BLOOD? ( sighs ) HE'S RIGHT. I'M SO STUPID. NO, YOU JUST HEARD WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR. SHE IS SO... SWEET. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE, MAN. WE WERE GONNA SHARE HER. THIS IS A COMMUNAL THING, ISN'T IT? BUT NOW THERE ARE TWO MORE. SIMS. WELL, YOU COULD JUST... YOU KNOW... DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING, AND WE'LL TAKE GABE AND GO. YES, WE COULD DO THAT, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO. ( laughter ) SHE IS SO SWEET, JUST LIKE A ROSE IN BLOOM. CAN THE POETRY, COUNT CHOCULA. SHE DOES LACK MANNERS, THOUGH, DOESN'T SHE? LET HER GO. I MEAN IT, VALENTINE. OHH! LET HER GO, LET HER GO. NO, I THINK NOT. NO. WELL, UNLESS... WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE'D BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD DO ONE TINY LITTLE THING FOR US. THAT IS, TO THROW ONE LITTLE SWITCH, ONE TINY SWITCH THAT WILL CONNECT THE UNDEAD EXPRESS TO THE REGULAR SUBWAY LINES. WHAT? BUT IF I DID THAT, YOU COULD-- YOU'D BE ABLE TO ATTACK NEW YORK. ACTUALLY, THAT OCCURRED TO US. ( laughter ) THINK OF IT AS A BARGAIN. YOU HELP US, AND WE HELP YOU. WE'D BE... SO GRATEFUL FOR IT. I CAN'T DO THAT! I CAN'T LET A TRAINFUL OF VAMPIRES LOOSE ON NEW YORK. WHY NOT? THEY'D PROBABLY BE A LOT SAFER THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. IN ANY EVENTS, ZACHARY, IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING, REALLY. EITHER YOU DO THIS LITTLE FAVOR FOR US, OR YOUR FRIEND HERE BECOMES ONE OF THE UNDEAD RIGHT NOW. Don't do it. OH, THAT'S BAD ADVICE. I CAN'T LET 'EM DO IT. I CAN'T. I CAN'T LET THEM DO THAT TO YOU, GABE. I DON'T WANT MY MOM-- YOUR MOM-- LIKE THEM. OH, THAT'S SO SAD. THAT'S SO SAD-- SHE DOESN'T WANT HER MOM TO BE LIKE US. ZACHARY, SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR FRIEND. STOP. I'LL DO IT. GOOD CHOICE. WHY DON'T YOU ACCOMPANY US? BRING HER, AND THE OTHERS AS WELL. FAR OUT. I'VE BEEN WAITING 60 YEARS FOR THIS. HARV WAS ONLY AN APPETIZER. SINCE YOU BROUGHT HIM UP, YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN SOMEONE WITH MORE BREEDING. THIS IS AS FAR AS WE VAMPIRES CAN GO, ZACHARY. I CAN GO BACK TO WALL STREET EARLY. START TRADING. BITE A BROKER. FEED AND GROW RICH AT THE SAME TIME! HEH HEH HEH! AND I COULD GO BACK TO THE FALLS. THEY REALLY ARE GORGEOUS, AND THE TOURISTS... HAVE SUCH GOOD TASTE! ( Sims hisses ) JUST AHEAD, ROUND THE CORNER, THERE'S A SWITCH. IF YOU THROW IT, WE CAN ROUTE THE UNDEAD EXPRESS TO ANY OF THE REGULAR LINES. AND THEN YOU START... FEEDING. YOU AND YOUR, UH, LITTLE FRIENDS WILL BE SAFE. PEOPLE? Sims: DEFINITELY! Vampire Woman: CERTAINLY! ( vampires murmur assent ) YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE LIGHT? YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO DWAYNE. WE CAN'T REACH THE SWITCH. WE NEED A LIVING HUMAN TO DO THAT, TO INVITE US OUT INTO THE WORLD, TO SHUT OUT THAT LIGHT. ME? IT IS FORTUNATE THAT YOU-- THAT YOU VOLUNTEERED. PERHAPS A, UH, A LOCAL, NOT AN EXPRESS. WHAT DO YOU THINK, ZACHARY? I DON'T KNOW. HOW 'BOUT THE, UH... THE NUMBER 7. FINE. SEVEN. SEVEN. I LIKE THAT. BIBLICAL, SEVEN, DON'T YOU THINK? NUMBER SEVEN! THAT'S MY LUCKY NUMBER, NUMBER SEVEN! ZACHARY, SEVEN. ♪♪ ♪♪ AND? I DID IT. GOOD. NOW, WE WILL BOARD THE UNDEAD EXPRESS. YOU SAID YOU'D LET US GO. ONLY IF YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD, AND WE AREN'T QUITE SURE OF THAT YET, ARE WE? NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, LET'S NOT HAVE A SCENE. ( vampire woman laughs softly ) NOW WE CAN GET UNDERWAY. ( vampires react with delight ) BETTER NOT HAVE TRIED THE OLD DOUBLE-CROSS, BOY! UNLIKE YOU, SOME PEOPLE CAN BE TRUSTED. ( chuckles ) I'M SURE YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS WILL AGREE. WHY DON'T YOU... TAKE A SEAT. DID YOU DO IT? YEAH, NUMBER SEVEN. WHAT TIME IS IT? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT! IT'LL BE SO NICE TO HAVE PEOPLE FOR DINNER! ( laughter ) TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH GOOD TASTE! HEY, GREAT TASTE, BUT LESS FILLING, MAN! ( laughter ) IT'S ALL MY FAULT. IF I'D HAVE NEVER LIED TO YOU GUYS. I'M SORRY. I'M NEVER GONNA LIE AGAIN, I PROMISE. FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I'M GONNA PLAY IT STRAIGHT. WE'RE ON! WE'RE ON THE MAIN LINE! ( laughter ) "THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"? THAT'S, LIKE, A MINUTE! ( vampires murmuring ) YOU SAID YOU'D LET US GO. DID WE SAY THAT? I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT. I MUST HAVE BEEN ON SOME HEAVY STUFF, MAN! HA HA HA! VALENTINE, STOP 'EM! WE HAD A BARGAIN. THERE'S TOO MANY OF US. WE WON'T LET HIM STOP US NOW. IT'S ALMOST OVER, ZACHARY. IT'S ALMOST OVER. ( vampires murmuring ) VALENTINE, YOU OWE ME! AND I AM GOING TO REPAY YOU! ( vampire woman laughing ) ( vampires screaming ) J.T., QUICK! BEHIND THE DOOR! ( vampires screaming and groaning ) ♪♪ ♪♪ FAR OUT, MAN! AAAHHHH! AAAHHH! YOU...! THANK YOU, FRIEND ZACHARY. ♪♪ ( snarling ) ( explosive sound ) HE KNEW. HE WANTED TO DIE... BUT HE COULDN'T KEEP THE REST OF THEM ALIVE. I WAS SCARED THAT THEY WOULD... I KNOW. ME TOO. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA BITE YOU AND... I KNOW. ♪♪ GUYS, WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM! PUSH SOMETHING! WHAT? I DON'T KNOW! ANYTHING! "STOP," NOT "GO"! WE'RE GONNA CRASH! ( air brakes hiss ) Woman: WHERE DID IT COME FROM? WONDER IF ANYBODY'S HURT? ( spectators remark ) WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! ( all reacting joyously ) WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! YES! ( excited chatter ) OH, CHILDREN! HOLD ON, HOLD ON, WHAT'S GOING ON? IT WAS AWFUL! HE JUST--HE JUST CAME OUT OF-- THE DRIVER! THE DRIVER'S IN THERE! ALL RIGHT, STICK AROUND! STICK AROUND! WHAT'S IN THERE? CAN YOU SEE? THE SMELL IS AWFUL! LOOK AT THE SMOKE! YEAH, I'M DOWN AT 33rd. WE GOT SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD GOING ON HERE. SO WE TOOK THE BUS HOME, AND GABE HELPED ME WITH MY PROJECT. I GOT A "C." I MEAN, THAT'S BETTER THAN I USUALLY DO, AND THAT'S WITH A GRADE MARK-DOWN. THAT'S GOOD. HOW 'BOUT YOU AND YOUR PARENTS? THEY'RE TALKING-- I MEAN, WITHOUT FIGHTING. AT LEAST THEY'RE FRIENDLIER NOW. AND THE LYING? NOPE. NEVER AGAIN. I LEARNED MY LESSON. GOOD MAN. DO YOU BELIEVE ME? ABOUT THE VAMPIRES? YEAH. AS A MATTER OF FACT, YES. YES, I DO. I DON'T THINK I NEED TO COME BACK HERE ANYMORE, DO I? NOPE. IT'S GREAT. I MEAN... I'M SORRY. ( chuckles ) IT'S OKAY. OH, AND ZACH, SAY HI TO YOUR FRIENDS FOR ME, GABE AND J.T. YEAH, SURE. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. ♪♪ FOR A WHILE THERE, I REALLY THOUGH ZACH WAS GOING TO JOIN ME HERE IN THE SHADOW ZONE PERMANENTLY! WELL... MAYBE NEXT TIME. Woman: AAAAHHHHH! IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I BELIEVE I HAVE OTHER GUESTS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE JUST DYING TO GET IN HERE! HA HA HA HA HA! MAYBE NEXT TIME, IT WILL BE YOU. ♪♪
