His life was filled with beauty. Not only was he blessed with a loyal and loving wife, but a most attractive daughter. (calm music) Sweet, kind, she was as lovely inside as she was out. Life, however, is not always predictable and darkness passed across the man's future and his wife took gravely ill. A few weeks later, she passed on. Winter came and covered everything in a blanket of white. (plops) And when the sun brought springtime, the rich man had found a second wife, who brought along her two daughters. Like their mother, they had nasty and wicked hearts. This did not bode well for the rich man's daughter. Sometime later, the rich man left on a long business trip. - But you just came back. - It can't be helped, I'm sorry. Now what might I bring back for you? - Well, I-- - A beautiful dress, my wonderful husband. - And candy. Lots of cherries covered with thick, creamy chocolate. - And pearls! A long magnificent strand to adorn my long and magnificent neck. - And you, my daughter? - I need nothing, Father. I wish only that you return safely. - I shall. Until then, farewell! - I miss you already, Father. - What did you say? - Nothing. - Then stop wasting time and go do your chores! (stepsisters laughing) - [Narrator] Blinded by his love for his new wife, the father didn't see what was happening to his daughter. The cruel stepsisters immediately took away her bedroom, her fine clothes, and made her do all the chores around the house while they had all the fun. (laughing) The father had no idea she was sleeping on a straw mat in front of the fireplace. And although the fire kept her warm, the ashes and cinders drifted across her, making her look dusty and dirty. The stepsisters made fun of her and called her Cinderella. (crying) (lively music) (sloshes) - I miss you, Mother. (mysterious music) - Why, Cindy, you've been crying. - You're alive? - Would I be talking if I wasn't alive? - No, but... Who are you? - I'm your fairy godmother, of course. - I didn't know I... - Nonsense. Everybody has a fairy godmother. Well, almost everybody. - You can fly! - Oh, I can do all sorts of things! Watch. (clatters) - But I just hung those up! - No problem. (laughs) - Oh, I wish you were here all the time. - I am, my sweet. And I know everything that's going on. - Then you know about my stepmother and stepsisters? - Their deeds will not go unpunished. You have my word. Now, no more tears, promise? - I promise. - Good. Pleasant dreams, my child. And fear no longer. - Good night to you, fairy godmother. (kisses) - Oh, too bad Cinderella can't play with us. - Somebody has to do all the chores. (laughing) - Cinderella! (gasps) (shatters) Now look what you've done. - You frightened me. - When you finish cleaning up your mess, the floors need to be scrubbed, the curtains cleaned, and the silver polished. - But I just polished the silver. - Well, do it again! I want to see my face in every spoon. What? What's happening? What is going on here? (laughs) - You cheated. - I did not. - Did too. - Did not. - Did too. - Did not. - You did! Besides, it's my turn anyway! - No, it's my turn. - Move! (tinkling music) (bounces) (crashes) (laughs) - [Narrator] Meanwhile, the king's son had just come of age. And the king and queen were anxious for the handsome prince to choose a wife from the rank and nobility in the land. - Do you think he likes her? - Well, if I could see, I could tell you. (crashes) - My father is the Duke of Rockingham and he is very, very wealthy. (sighs) My grandfather was even wealthier. - Wealth isn't important to me. - Our collection of fine art is the most exceptional in the land. Save yours, of course. Huh? - Quick, dear, he's coming. - Well? - Isn't she lovely? - I will not marry someone I don't love. - But-- - I have an idea. We will hold a grand ball and invite all the eligible young ladies we can find. - Yes, a magnificent ball, a feast! Surely you'll be able to find your princess then? - I will agree under one condition. - Speak, my son. - The choice is mine and mine alone. - Agreed. The invitation shall go out immediately! (upbeat music) (knocking) (stepsisters laughing) - I got it, I got it! It's mine! (grunts) (laughs) - It's here! The invitation is here! The king and queen request the pleasure of your company at the grand ball to be held at the royal palace three days hence. - Oh, mother, that's wonderful! But I need a new dress. - Me too, me too, me too! - Not to worry, my children. You shall have whatever you need. (laughing) - May I go to the ball? - That's hardly possible, Cinderella. You certainly don't expect me to buy three new dresses, do you? - Well, I just thought it would be... - Besides, you can't even dance. Come, girls. There's so much to do! - I will not cry. I will not cry. I will not cry. - [Stepmother] Cinderella! (owl hooting) - [Narrator] The night of the ball arrived and the kind-hearted Cinderella tried her utmost to help her stepsisters get ready. ♪ The time's approaching ♪ The carriages were called ♪ To take the young ladies out to the ball ♪ (laughing) ♪ Oh, so pretty in satin ♪ So pretty in lace ♪ With ringlets of curls around every face ♪ ♪ It's the chance of a lifetime ♪ ♪ A chance to begin anew ♪ A chance to capture the heart of the prince ♪ ♪ And make your dreams come true ♪ ♪ The time is here ♪ The carriage is called ♪ The trumpeters herald the start of the ball ♪ ♪ The pretty young ladies are ready to dance ♪ ♪ But no one will give Cinderella a chance ♪ ♪ It's the chance of a lifetime ♪ ♪ A chance to begin anew ♪ A chance to capture the heart of the prince ♪ ♪ And make your dreams come true ♪ ♪ I missed my chance of a lifetime ♪ ♪ I missed my chance for romance ♪ ♪ All my dreams are turned to dust ♪ ♪ I never had a chance - Everything ready? - Oh, please can I go? Won't you please reconsider? - Well, she did help us get dressed. - Alright. I've just emptied a bowl of lentils into the ashes. Pick them out of the fireplace before our coach arrives and you can go. - Oh, thank you, thank you! How will I ever do this in time? - [Fairy Godmother] Not to worry, Cindy. We'll take care of it. (swishes) (chirping) - Oh my goodness! (drops) - I don't suppose you've finished, have you? - I did what you asked. - So you have. (ominous music) (drops) Except for that one. - But the rest are in the bowl. - I said all, not all but one. - Our coach is here. - I will not cry. I will not cry. I will not cry. (crying) - Come on, Cindy. Stop it before you drown us both. - I know I promised not to cry, but... - Oh, it's alright. I understand. Why, even fairy godmothers cry once in a while. Follow me. - Where are we going? - You, my darling Cindy, are going to the ball. - To the ball? But how? - Now get me a pumpkin. - A pumpkin? - Yes. Yes, you know, a round orange thing. A pumpkin. - But how will a pumpkin get me to the ball? - Enough with all the questions. Leave it to me. In the meantime, get me four mushrooms, six lizards, and a rat. - A what? How strange this all is. - You haven't seen anything yet. Now go, go! The fun's just beginning. Birds of a feather, come back together. Scoop it clean, my crested companions. - I couldn't find any lizards. - Well, look in the watering can. Now hurry! - I found the lizards! - Well done, Cindy. Now place it here. - What do you want to do with these things? - Don't worry. Now stand back, my darling. The fun has just begun! (swishes) - (gasps) Oh, I can't believe it! But how can I go to such an elegant affair in these wretched rags? - Not to worry. - It's beautiful! But... - Yes, I know, I know. - Glass slippers? How unusual. - Not a bad touch, if I do say so myself. Come, it's time to go. One last thing. You must not remain at the ball beyond midnight. - Why not? - If you stay a moment longer, the charm will be broken and everything will change back to its old self. - Before midnight, I promise. (banging) - What is it? Well, (laughs) nobody's perfect. (swishes) Be gone, my Cindy. And have the time of your life! Remember what I told you! Be home before the clock strikes 12. - I will, fairy godmother, I will! (lively music) - I must say, dear, you've really outdone yourself. Everyone who is anyone is here. - If this doesn't get our son a wife, I don't know what will. We have the finest orchestra all the way from Vienna, the most important chef from Paris, and the most beautiful young ladies in the land. - Alright, girls, get in there and get him. You can do it, now go! (crashes) - Would you honor me with a dance, your highness? I understand you have feet like wings. - I beg your pardon? - Dance with me! I'm so much more graceful. - You are not. You dance like a stork. - That's a lie! - It is not. - Is too. - [Short Stepsister] Oh yeah? Well, you're a dunce. - [Tall Stepsister] Am not. - [Short Stepsister] Are too. - [Tall Stepsister] Am not. - [Short Stepsister] Are too! - What do you suppose happened? - I've never seen anyone as-- Your face is like... You're the most beautiful young lady I've ever seen. - I'm flattered. Thank you. - May I escort you inside? - It would be my honor. (gasps) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, announcing the prince! (applause) - The prince? - What a charming creature. - Charming indeed. - What grace. - What elegance. - What nerve. And who is she anyway? (upbeat music) - That's the gaudiest dress I've ever seen! - And those shoes. Who ever heard of glass slippers? - He'll soon tire of her, you'll see. - [Narrator] But the prince did not tire of Cinderella. He danced only with her for the rest of the evening. So entranced was Cinderella with the prince that she forgot all about her fairy godmother's warning. (clock chiming) - (gasps) Oh no! Forgive me, your highness, but I must go. - Wait! I don't even know your name! - Please, please let me go before it's too late! (gasps) No! (breathing heavily) - Did you see a lady come running out? - She ran into the maze, your highness. But she looked more like a peasant than a lady. - [Prince] Hello? - Oh no, no! - Hello? Come back! (rips) - [Narrator] Afraid to get caught, Cinderella left her glass slipper behind and fled into the night. (tinkling music) - How could I have lost you so soon? - I know he must love me, but I do love him. But how will he ever find me? ♪ Where has she been all my life? ♪ ♪ I'm drawn like a moth to her flame ♪ ♪ I'd make her my princess ♪ I'd make her my wife ♪ But I don't even know her name ♪ ♪ How can I find her? ♪ Where could she be? ♪ Without her I won't be the same ♪ ♪ Without her my heart will never be free ♪ ♪ But I don't even know her name ♪ ♪ He's the one I've been waiting for ♪ ♪ The handsome prince of my dreams ♪ ♪ I've never felt this way before ♪ ♪ Afloat in a sea of moonbeams ♪ Could this be love the way that I feel? ♪ ♪ Will I ever see him again? ♪ I have to know if love is real ♪ ♪ Without him my world will end ♪ ♪ Where have you been all my life? ♪ ♪ I've been waiting for someone like you ♪ ♪ Will you be my princess, will you be my wife? ♪ ♪ My darling, yes, I do ♪ Come back, come back, I love you so ♪ ♪ Save me, they're tearing me away ♪ ♪ Darling, tell me your name before you go ♪ ♪ I can't hear you ♪ Oh please, help me stay ♪ Where has love been all my life? ♪ ♪ Why is love leaving this way? ♪ ♪ Who will console me and kiss away my tears ♪ ♪ When love has gone away? ♪ When love has gone away? (sighs) (slow music) (crowd chattering) - Hear ye, hear ye. Let it hereby be known that the royal prince requests all single ladies, regardless of rank or stature, to try on this unique glass slipper. Furthermore, whomever this slipper shall fit will become the bride of the prince and be the princess of the land. (crowd chattering) - [Narrator] The prince traveled over hills and valleys in search of his true love. (springing) (squeaking) But alas, no one was found to fit the slipper. The prince was growing weary of his fruitless quest as he turned up the road to where Cinderella lived. (horse neighs) - (gasps) He's here! The prince is coming. - Cinderella, close that door and come here this instant. - My feet are freezing! - And mine are boiling. - Oh, stop complaining. The idea is to get them to fit into the slipper. - But my foot will never shrink enough to fit. - And I don't think that mine'll get any bigger. - They better. Cinderella! Dispose of these buckets. - May I try on the slipper too? (laughs) - Absolutely not. You're much too dirty to be seen. As soon as you dispose of these buckets, go upstairs to the attic and wait until I call you down. - But I... - Do as I say. Now! (knocking) Good afternoon, your highness. We've been expecting you. Won't you please come inside? (laughs) - If only I could try on that slipper, the prince would know I'm the one he loves. Isn't there anything you can do? - I'm thinking, I'm thinking. - Oh, please, hurry! The prince won't be here forever. - One thing you must learn, my dear. Never rush a fairy godmother! (grunting) - Push harder, dear. - I'm trying! - Stop, before the slipper shatters! Then I shall never find my beloved. (grunts) - Sorry, Mother. - Next? - Oh, I just adore glass! - Oh, no, no, I'm afraid your foot is much too small. - Perhaps if she tried again. - Don't you have any other daughters? - No, I... - I was told you had three daughters. - (laughs) Well, actually I do. But Cinderella's only my stepdaughter and surely she couldn't be the one. (distant singing) - That voice! It's her! ♪ The handsome prince of my dreams ♪ ♪ I've never felt this way before ♪ - Louder! ♪ Afloat in a sea of moonbeams ♪ Could this be love, the way that I feel? ♪ - I have heard that voice in my dreams ever since we danced. I'm sure it is her! - With all due respect, your highness, it's only Cinderella. - Bring her down here at once! - [Stepmother] But your highness... - At once! - Fetch her. (laughs) Oh dear. - I pray that I am right. - You wish to see me, your highness? - No, please. Be seated. - A perfect fit, my lord. - I knew it. - She was lucky! There must be some mistake. A mere coincidence. It can't be Cinderella. - It is possible, my lord. (dramatic music) (thumps) Hmm, what's this? - The other slipper. I lost only one the night of the ball. - We shall see. - You are the one! You shall be my bride. - Oh. (sniffling) - No, sire, she cannot be the one. Why, look at those ragged clothes, that dirty face! - I did not fall in love with a fancy dress. Nor can a few simple ashes conceal her beauty. It is Cinderella I love. - And I you, my prince. - [Narrator] A few days later, the prince and Cinderella were married. It was a grand and glorious ceremony, and Cinderella looked more beautiful than ever, while the prince was happier than he ever dreamed he would be. Cinderella's father had returned from his trip to give away the bride, but she never told him how much she had suffered. And when her stepsisters apologized for their thoughtlessness, Cinderella, with a goodness that knew no bounds, saw to it that they married two handsome lords. Cinderella and the prince lived in comfort and happiness for the rest of their lives. And while Cinderella grew to be a beautiful woman, it was her good grace that was far more precious than her beauty, and her forgiveness that was a jewel beyond price. As all who hear this story know, only true kindness is worthy of a fairy godmother's gift. For without kindness, we can do nothing.
