(knocking on the door) - Hi, we don't open until noon. - What? - We're not open until noon. - I'm Corinne. Amanda told me to come in. She told me to come in early to train. -L-m - Hi. - I'm sorry, what was that? - I'm Corinne and Amanda told me to come in, early today to train. - Are you Jeannie? - Yes. - Well, she told me that you would be here to train me so... - All right. Come on in. - Okay. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. - You too... - Corinne. - Okay, Corinne. So, um, when did Amanda hire you? - Well, she called last night. I had come in here a couple weeks ago and I'm friends with her friend Evan. - Okay. Have you done any retail before? - I worked in a couple of bookstores. - Cashiering? Inventory? - Well, the last job that I had was at this Portland bookstore and it was a pretty small operation so basically everybody did everything, so... - Great, well, that's kind of how this goes. Eventually you'll be manning the store on your own, but, you'll have... There's a lotto learn, but you'll have time to pick it up. - Well, I think, I just love small businesses and I love working in them so I think that this will be the perfect environment. I think I'll be able to pick it up pretty fast. - Good, good. I never saw your application so, could you tell me your full name and number? - Yeah, it's Corinne Meltzer. - Is that two R's, one N? - It's one R, two N's. (phone ringing) - Why don't you answer that? Just answer it, "Storyville." . Okay" Good morning, Storyville Boutique, how may I help you? Ah, no, this is Corinne. Good. Sure, hang on for a second. - [Jeannie] Go ahead and hit the mute button when you're passing the phone. - Oh. I'm sorry. - It's this one. And if it's for me or for Amanda, we do a lot of sales calls so just ask 'em who they are, what they want and try to get a straight answer. They'll say anything to get past you. - [Corinne] Okay, well, actually that is Amanda. - Okay, excuse me, I'm going to take this in the back. - [Corinne] Okay. . Hey- Yeah. Yeah, she did. Yeah, you know, it's fine. I just... It would have been nice if you had let me know last night. Uh-huh, well, are you coming in later today? Tomorrow? Yeah, need your signature. I can, you know, have them mailed if that's easier, you know. - Um... I'm totally happy with things and if you're not, why don't you, you know, just say so? - I'm happy, l just, I... I don't know, I feel like I'm sort of only halfway in it, you know. That doesn't really seem fair. - Well, I don't know. It works for me. But if, you know, if that's not what... If that's not what, you know, if that's not working for you, then why don't you just, you know, just break up? - Okay. I mean, oh, yeah. We should... We should try breaking up. - You want to try? (laughs) No, that's, talk about half-assed. You know, I mean, if you want to do it, let's do it! It's... Let's... - Check it out. - "I'm writing this e-mail..." - What do you think about that line? First... Second paragraph. - "This is why we signed an agreement together?" - Yeah. - In the first place. "Not because we didn't trust each other, and not because we were anticipating problems down the line, but in fact, to ensure that there wouldn't be problems." (sighs) I'm feeling really frustrated by our partnership right now. And that's why I'm revisiting the contract." - Hmm. It sounds bad. "If we can't communicate like that now, it might be easier for me at this point to just rely on the letter of the law." - l.e., get a lawyer. - Dude, I don't think she's gonna sue you. I do think you need to call her. - You think I need to kill her'? - I think you need to call her. - Kill her'? - Call her. - Kill her. Kill her. - Oh. Okay. - Can I help you with anything? - No thanks, doing fine. (soft music) - You know, can we talk about this after work, 'cause now is not really a good time for me. Sure, sure. I'll give you a call, okay'? Thanks. - Summer morning, what's better to do, right? - Yeah, they look good. (chuckles) H BY- - HEY- - I brought you a special surprise. - Thank you. So, they're in the back. ' [Amanda] Okay. - [Lauren] Happy surprise. . (m, goody'-! - [Lauren] Fun surprise. - Gooey. Poopy- (laughing) - Michael, would you like one? - [Michael] No, thanks. - It's my favorite. - Poopy special. Supposed to cheer you up- - Don't lean, don't lean. . Sorry- . sorry- - Here. Be right back, excuse me. - There are a million things to break around here, for crying out loud. - [Michael] And they're breaking all the time. (both laughing) - l'll be careful. - [Michael] Hi. - Do you guys have a return policy? - [Michael] Our return policy is we don't accept returns. - What about, can I place it on hold? - Like we take it? Keep it for you? - Like you take it, maybe a couple days. - I think that's fine. Michael, I think it's fine. - Yeah, yeah, sure. It's fine. - So, you leaving tomorrow? - Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow early. - The Dominican Republic again? - Uh-huh. Robert's doing a talk, I think. And I'm gonna meet with some housing people there, that he knows and maybe do some work so, that will be cool, I think. - [Jeannie] Sure. - Yeah, and I'm gonna look for stuff for the store also. Yeah. - Okay. - [Jeannie] Do you want me to write you that check for the $630? - Yeah. But not right now. (laughs) At this point, it's really something I can wait another week for, answer we weeks. So... . Okay" - And two, about the email that I sent you and all that stuff, you know, we're gonna have to talk about ii when I get back, when we both've had some time to think about it but I really... We'll figure something out. But, yeah. - Okay. - Great, I'll see you soon. - Have a good trip. - Thanks. See you guys. - Bye, Anne. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Have a good trip. - [Anne] Thank you, you too. (laughing) - I'll have a good trip to the grocery store or something. - [Anne] All right, bye. - Bye. - There's no delineation of the division of labor in your contract - Well, I mean, but it doesn't say anything either about the division of power. - [Woman 1] But, it does say that managerial decisions have to be unanimous. - Right, but it didn't say anything like what happens if they're not, I mean, she can't sue me, can she? - [Woman 1] Oh, well, let's back up. Has she filed a lawsuit against you? - No. - [Woman 1] ls she threatening to sue you? - It seems that way to rne. - Okay, well, tell me a little bit about y'all's background. - You know, we were good friends, not great friends, but... We, you know, mostly hung out with other people. Like, we met through a friend Stacey who is not friends with Amanda anymore. Amanda kinda shut her out. I don't know if that really matters but that's... Feels like what she's doing to me. - [Woman 1] Okay, so why did y'all decide to become partners? - You know, I was friendly with the people who owned the place at the time and Amanda was really involved and helpful at the beginning with, you know, I did most of the legwork but she really had a role in kind of getting things going and... Does this matter for, like, the conflict or... - Oh, I just like to have some information about the background and relationships. So, tell me, do you think you have a legal complaint against her for violating this contract or any other laws? - No, no, it's just kind of, you know, her dad wrote the contract and it just seems a little like it's written in her favor as the lazier partner, that, it just, 'cause there's nothing in there about, like, who does the work. - So, you think that you might have been taken advantage of at the time that you signed the contract? - Do you? I mean... - Well, that is sometimes a claim that is made that people will try to say that they weren't sophisticated enough to understand the legal contract. But you're gonna need witnesses who can say that and who can establish what happened when it was signed. And some proof to show that you did not understand what you were signing. And unfortunately for you, you come across as a fairly intelligent person. (chuckling) - Well, thank you, I guess. . Sorry- - Well, is there, I mean, is there anything I should do at this point? - At this point, if she hasn't taken any action against you and it doesn't sound like you want to take any action against her legally at this point. - Yeah, no, no. no. - That's gotta be it right? B? - You think B? - Yeah, what do you think? It's gotta be B. 'Cause, the other ones were... D is ridiculous 'cause she can't... (Phone ringing) Hold on one sec. - All right ifs B. Let's say it's B. - Hey, Merrill, this is Jeannie, I don't really want to leave a message... Oh, shit. Hello? Damn it. Shit. - I'm sorry, it will just be a few more minutes. Emeka's just in a conference and they're just finishing up, if you wanna help yourself there's some water and snacks in the break room just around the corner. So, feel free to help yourself to anything, and he won't be too much longer, okay? - [All] Thank you. - Hi, Lee. - You look familiar. - I have an interview today, I don't know if... - I know, I set it up. - Okay, okay, thanks for that (chuckling) - You're welcome, you're welcome. So, you ever taught before? - Yes, I've, I taught art to second graders, right out of college, and, is this the interview? - I don't know, could be. - Okay, so I have done some tutoring of high school students. - Uh-huh, okay. - Math and science mostly. Calculus, chemistry- - Anything overseas? - No. - Foreign languages? - I speak French, and a little Spanish and I've traveled abroad. - Mmm-hmm. - Um... - That's good. - But just backpacking kind of thing, but I've never lived abroad, but, I really enjoyed it. - Scott's well. - That's good to hear. - Yeah. - I mean, I'm not surprised actually, he's a resilient kinda... He's a strong guy. - Yeah, he's... - I guess I'm not that tough either. - No, you look pretty strong. You look like you work out. Got some guns. - Ah, not a whole lot of lifting power there. - I bet you could beat me at a pushup contest, though. - Emeka, this is Lauren. - [Emeka] Hi, Lauren. Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. - Lauren used to date my brother. - Oh, I see, How was that? - Great! He's a great guy. - Yeah, yeah, great guy, huh? - I know Lauren, she dated my brother, she's bad news. I mean, basically. So I'm sitting there, smiling like an idiot. - Totally sucks. - I've never been able to figure that guy out - Wait, which guy? - Lee. . Okay" - Scott, at least... Scott I could figure out halfway at least, you know. Enough to... To wanna know more. - So why, what was ii that made you know that it was time to give up? - I don't think it, I mean, I didn't know. (laughs) (line ringing) - Wait. Hang on. Oh, fucking A. It's just cycling over again. - We need a way for you to channel your hold rage. (phone ringing) (laughing) - Oh, my God. (laughing) - Hello? - Hey, Jeannie, it's Merrill. - Hey, sorry about that message earlier today. Yeah... Well, I guess what I wanted to tell you was, I have a question... Goddamn it. This fucking phone! I'm sorry. I... Sorry. Oh, yes. Thank you. - Se if I do get a hold of these people what do you want me to tell them? - Tell 'em their phones suck and ask them for another one. Maybe get some free minutes or something. - I'll do my best. - This is Merrill. - Okay, then! - Do you, I mean, the way you remember it, do you think I was coerced? - Coerced? No. I don't. - Why not? - Well, I mean, l think it was just ignorance on your part, quite frankly. - Okay, that's fair. - You know. l just like, at the time I don't think you were really paying that much attention to the details, to all the specifics in the contract. - Right, well, I didn't think I needed to. - Yeah, I didn't either, and that's why I didn't either. You know? And I probably could have and I probably should have but I didn't... - Well, it's not your deal. - Yeah. But all that being said, you know, I don't think coercion is in play here. You know, it's not a crime to take advantage of ignorant people. Right? - Yeah, it is, isn't it? Sometimes. - Well, yeah, sure, but it depends on the circumstances, right? Depends what kind of ignorance, what kind of advantage, right? And then you gotta scoop all that up, you gotta take it to a judge, which is probably way, way, way more hassle than you or Amanda probably wants. Right? - So when do you take the bar'? - In about two minutes. Mmm-hmm. - Is that a sore point for you? - A little bit. Little bit. Yeah, I'm just not feeling, you know, 150% confident, or even 100%, I guess, about it. Which is normal, you know, they tell us that's normal, but I just still, I don't know. So let me ask you, so is that why you wanted to chat? To ask me legal advice? - I mean, it's good to see you. - Was it legal advice or was it kind of more emotional, interpersonal? - Well, you know, it's just, I don't... - You know, it's just, it's pretty, you know, it's pretty intense to see you. - It's intense to see you too. - Really? Really? - Well, that was fun, it was good to see you. - Yeah, that was fun. It was nice to see you too. - So, do you need more of a study break? - [Merrill] Getting ready for bed? - It's just, I wanted to stretch my back a bit. - Yeah. You tired? - Yeah. Will you do my leg? - Stretch it oui? (sighing) That feel good? - Yeah, thank you. - Mmm. (chuckling) Thank you. - Mmm-hmm. You want me to stretch your arm too? - No, it's all right, it's perfect. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Should we get the door'? - In a minute. - This is crazy. - Why? - I still feel so jittery. - Do you? - Yeah, it's weird. - Yeah, it feels kind of, I don't know, I guess it feels a little different. It's different but it's also kind of familiar I guess at the same time. And then I feel there's this added element... You know, of... I'm gonna get the door. (snoring) - Merrill. Lauren? (snoring) Hey, Merrill, it's time to wake up. Merrill, come on. - All right, all right. I heard you. I heard you, boss woman. - Um... This might sound a little harsh but, Lauren's not here... - [Merrill] Mmm-hmm. - And it just seems kinda like an omen. - [Merrill] How do you mean? - You know, like, well, I thought... I thought you were gonna see her today and, you know, now I don't have to do that. And we don't have to explain anything. It just, you know, it just seems kinda... Like we got away with it. (laughs) - [Merrill] So, I don't have to do to the walk of shame. Is that what you're saying? - Well, I mean, it's not shame. I mean, I feel fine about it, it just- - I feel great about it. I really do. I thought it was great. I thought last night was awesome. I really do. - Me too, I just, when I went in there and she wasn't there, I got kind of excited and it made me realize that... Let's... We just shouldn't do it again, that's all. - And go back to radio silence? - Well, I mean, not radio silence, just... You know, maybe we could find some middle ground between radio silence and hot sex. - {chuckling} Hot sex. All right. Was that what that was? Was that hot sex? - Yeah, I mean, I don't know. - [Merrill] I thought it was hot sex. - At least... - [Merrill] At least one of us did? You don't think that was hot sex? - No. It was scorching. It was incredible. - You're just saying that. - No, it was. You know, I was going for a different word but... So, I don't know when Lauren's getting home but... - [Merrill] All right. - Hey, Merrill. - Hey, Lauren, how are you? - Pretty good. How are you doing? - All right. What's going on? - A little hung over, but feeling optimistic. - Uh-huh. You have a big night last night? - I wouldn't really call it big so much. Long, yes. - Uh-huh. - [Lauren] Yeah. Slept the last couple hours on someone's couch. - Cool. So, me and Jeannie hung out last night - I see you're here. I'm here. Well, we had pie last night. We chatted about some stuff and she forgot her cell phone at the restaurant, so I just came by to give it back to her. - Okay. I believe your story, Merrill. - Good, good you should. - Are you a lawyer yet? - [Merrill] Soon, hopefully. I finished law school and now I just gotta pass the bar. - Okay. - Mmm-hmm. Actually, I should probably be studying right now. . Okay" Sweet. Well, if you want to study on the soccer field there's... - What do you mean? - We're about to play soccer around the corner. So... - You are? - Yeah. - Right now? - A little fresh air is good for the brain. You should join us. - You going right now-right now? - Yeah, yeah. - Huh, okay, maybe I'll walk down there with you. - Sweet. Okay. - Then I'll walk back. - L just gotta, I'll be right back. . Okay" - Hey, Jeannie. - Hey. Did you have fun last night? - Yeah. It's not really over yet, though. Marco's getting some guys together to play soccer. - Right on. You get any sleep? You stay at Marco's? - Yes. Yes. On the couch, though, so no scandal. I'll see you. - Have fun. - Hey, Lauren. I'm actually, I'm gonna go. - You're going? - I'm gonna go, yeah. - You're not. - Yeah, I am. I have so much shit I got to do. I'm going to feel guilty if I don't. - Fine. - It was nice seeing you, though. - You too. - It's been a little while. - Yeah, it's been forever. - Yeah. - I missed you. - Yeah, I missed you too. - Okay, well, have fun with your flash cards. - Yeah, have fun with the game. Score one for the good team. . Okay" - Almost. - Okay, fine, bye. - All right, have fun. - [Lauren] Have a good day. - Bye. (gentle music) (Phone ringing) - Hey, honey, we were just wondering what your ETA would be? - Oh, when did she leave Austin? - What, say again? Okay, good, Sally says hi, she also wants to thank you very much for coming up to help with her fundraiser this weekend. Well, it's a little late to be wondering about that, isn't it? - Hi, Mom. - Hey, Lauren. Come on in. We've already eaten, but we'll get you something out of the refrigerator. - [Lauren] It smells good. - You think you can pick up a few hours at the store? - Mmm. Well, shes got real employees, you know. I could probably pick up some hours from my friend Marco doing landscaping stuff and there are a couple of freelancing things that might come through. Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome. - Well, you know, Lauren. I'm moving on Monday, I'm moving my office, and I was hoping we could press you into service if you could hang around till then. - Yeah, we could slip you some cash for that The last couple weeks have been so educational. H's been like, A.C. has been great The staff- - Oh yeah. - The volunteers have been terrific. You're a total champ for coming down here, I really appreciate it. - Well, it seems like people are working hard 'cause you're inspiring them. - Oh, well, that's very kind. I wish the board felt that way but they're just so paranoid and bureaucratic. L just, you know, if I could get them behind me, then I'd be cooking with gas, but it's really... So, I don't mean to... Wanna be a buttinsky but I wanted to ask you about Jeannie. - What? - Buttinsky? It's somebody who butts in. - I haven't heard the term. - I must be showing my age, it's like a '60s Soviet thing, Sputnik and beatniks and neatniks and nogoodniks and then everything was Russky, so buttinsky... - Okay. (chuckles) So, the board is a bunch of buttinsky types? - That would be putting it kindly. - Okay. All right. - But, so, this morning I was talking to your mom at breakfast and, we were talking about Jeannie's legal problems and, you know, your mom wasn't crazy about the idea but I thought if Jeannie needed a silent partner then I'd be actually be happy to come on board as that. And then maybe even you could co-manage the store with her. I mean, that would be up to you and... - Well I'm definitely not the one to talk to about this. But I think you're kinda jumping the gun, actually. - Yeah. Yes, I'm sure I'm five steps ahead like always. But, you know, I mean, I don't know if you know I have my own money. So I could... Oh, hey, Al}. . Hey- . Hey- - How you doing? - How you doing? - Great. All right, that's all. ' [Lauren] Okay. You should talk to Jeannie. Not me. - Corinne, do you know anything about this shin back here? - Oh, yeah, Michael wanted me to let you know that he made it for you. - That's kinda weird. - [Corinne] You think so? I think he was just trying to be nice. - You don't think ifs a little passive-aggressive? - [Corinne] No, did you see the back of it or... - No, what is it? - [Corinne] Let me get it for you. (chuckling) - [Jennie] Yeah, I guess so. - I mean, I think he was being nice about it. - I guess, yeah, I can appreciate that. - It's cool. - You know, I want this to feel like it's your store too. - [Corinne] Yeah. - It's like a family and, you know, you bring different things to it, you help out in different ways, and, you know, make it yours, you know? - Yeah. Well, I actually have two things to tell you, the light bulbs are out in the first two dressing rooms and I was trying to find the spare ones to replace them, but I don't know where they are. - They're right down here. - I looked down there, they're not anymore, so... - Shit. How did this happen? - I don't know. - [Jeannie] ls this my fault? Is this your fault, did you do something? - No, no. I didn't do anything. - Are you and Michael running some sort of light bulb ring? - No, no. - What made them go out? My grand mother, she never ran out of vanilla. - [Corinne] Well... - I never have vanilla. - Well, if it's any comfort we actually made a lot of money today. So... (cash register whirring) Yeah, crazy mad money, so... - That works for me. Will you pass me the yellow pages? - Yeah. - Thank you. - The other thing that I wanted to talk to you about is that next week I'm gonna be going to a rally in support for equal marriage rights for everybody, and I wanted to know if I could put flyers up in the store? - Yeah, sure, just, you know, let me look at them at some point, and- - Okay. Well, I actually have them with me. Right here. This is what they look like. - "Equal love." - [Corinne] They're pretty cool. I designed them so... - Good paper. - Yeah. - It's a nice design. - Yeah, it's kind of crumpled. - Yeah, go for it. - Okay, do you mind if I put a stack of them up on the counter and then a couple of them in the window? - Yeah, that's fine. - [Corinne] Okay. - Let me give you the tape. Will you pass me the phone? - [Corinne] Oh, yeah. - Thank you. You know, you should think of coming 'cause we really need all the support we can, and it's a super good cause. - Yeah, ii most definitely is. - Yeah. - Corinne, is this one oi those things where you might get arrested? - [Corinne] No, no, no, no. This is just like a, more like a peaceful rally. The only times I've ever been arrested a1 protests is when we actually planned on getting arrested. - Well, uh... I mean, if... Do you have someone that can cover for you just in case you were to get arrested? - It's not like they're gonna send me up the river or anything, you know. - They could hold you overnight, could they not? - Well, there's a possibility, but I could also get hit by a bus too, so... - Well, I mean, I've never been arrested, I don't know how long they keep you, but it wouldn't be that hard to get Michael to be on call. - No, you don't need to do that. I'll make it in. - Okay, well, just hear me out If, say you're out there, you know, doing your civic duty, it's a great cause, I totally believe in gay marriage, but, you know, what if you're out there and something happens and you're gonna get arrested? I don't want the first thing on your mind to be, "Oh, shit. I can't be here, I can't do this, you know, 'cause I told Jeannie I wouldn't miss my shift," you know? - [Corinne] Yeah, I know what you're saying, but I'm gonna make it in. - I mean, but you can't miss your shift either. You know? You know that, you know that. - [Corinne] Jeannie, I understand that I understand. - Hi. - Hi. - [Woman 2] I'm not gonna get this, where can I put it? - L'll take it. - Oh, thanks. - [Corinne] Do you want me to get this? - Yeah, that would be great. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - There you go. - This is a cool shirt. - Yeah, it has feathers on it. - Corinne, I totally, I trust your judgment. - Okay, it will be $19.44. Thank you, I appreciate it. I think I can be both punctual and righteous, so I don't think that's gonna be a problem. (laughs) - Did you find everything all right? - [Woman 2] Yeah, yeah, thanks. - That should be our store motto. Punctual and righteous. - Yeah, it should, it's a good one. - Are you reading over my shoulder? - What? Don't worry about it. - Forget it. - Here, let me... There's a song I wanna play. (grunts) This song always makes me cry. (light hearted guitar music) I Night seems to fall ♪ I I'll find a way ♪ - I like it. - Yeah, it's nice. - Now, when you say cry, you mean, like, it makes you bawl your head off or something or... - You know... - Or are you just like, kind of moist eyes, like a drop? - Like, if I'm in the zone, if I'm, like, in the matrix, sometimes I like, I cry like a little bitch, you know. - As it should be. - Mmm-hmm. I I'll find a way ♪ ♪ To carry it all ♪ ♪ Many's the time ♪ I When love seemed so fine I .Trying. (chuckling) I'm sorry. (laughing) I'm sorry. I guess I feel a little self-conscious, like I got to... Well, I don't have the relationship with this song that you do, clearly. - You want me to make you cry? - No, no, I’ll just listen. - I'm not gonna hit you. (laughing) (Phone ringing) - I know you're not. Hey, Jeannie. Hey, three guesses who I'm hanging out with right now. No. No. - Give me a clue. - We're getting high right now. - (laughing) A.C. - It's the Ace! All. Lawler. - Speaking of Lawler and lawlessness, you know, you have jury duty Monday? - (laughing) Jury duty? Shit. - Lauren, Lauren, Lauren. Lauren... - On Monday, July 16th at 8:00 a.m. - Tell your sister I've had the hugest crush on her, the longest time. - No, l totally... I blanked, I... - Lauren, Lauren. Seriously. - I... - Oh, I'll talk to Mom. Anyway... - Lauren. Lauren. Lauren. Lauren. (laughing) - Shut up, dude! Oh, no, she's fine. She's kind of doing her manic thing but it's working. (sighs) Oh, no, yeah, I saw it. I saw ii. I saw Mom's reply too. I like it, I thought it was good, you know, firm but tactful. Oh, absolutely, send away, yeah. Yeah, see you before Monday. Okay. All right. Love you, Jeannie. Bye. - Oh, you didn't tell her. - About your deadly crush, what did you say? - Yeah. Yeah! - Seriously, call her back. - So what do you want me to do about it? - Call her back, call her back. She's busy. - [C.A] You have to call her back. This is important, this is important. - You wanna help? - No. - Shoot. Testing. - Hey, A.C., can you help me with this please? Hello, everybody, it's great to see you here. Couldn't be... What a beautiful day for a fundraiser, hey? Eh? (laughs) Couldn't be more pleased, it's a sold out show. Tell me this is gonna work. - It'll work. - Can I... - Okay, try it now. - All right, is it on? - Yeah. - Okay, thanks, let me check the other. Hello? Oh! Damn ii. Hello, hello, is it on? Is ii on? No'? Yes'!? I'm not hearing it. I'm not hearing it. Am I not hearing myself? - Hey, Mom, I forgot to tell you that I have jury duty tomorrow, so, I can't help with your office. - Oh, shoot. - Tomorrow, but I can totally do it today if you wanna do that. - No, Lauren, that won't work because I was gonna ask the guys in shipping to help with the big ticket items and they won't be there today, so it won't work tonight. - [Lauren] Well, I bet AC. could help out with that stuff. - No, no, you know, because... - [Lauren] No, seriously, we could- - You know, we're gonna be... It's gonna be late when we get out of here and we'll be hungry and we're gonna be pooped- - I could totally power through, Mom. Mom, I'm young, strong. - Yeah, but if you can, I can't. I'm the brains in the operation, I know where everything is, where it goes. - [Lauren] Okay, how about if I'm going with or without you? - No, 'cause I'm not gonna give you the keys. ' [Sally] Lauren? - [Lauren] Ugh. Yeah, sorry, Sally. - [Sally] Oh. You're the alibi. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Lauren, civilized people have dinner, go to bed at a decent hour, get a full night's sleep. There's no need for your guerrilla actions tonight You're off the hook. - [Sally] What are we talking about? - You're blowing it, Mom. - Eh. - Five of them have had to end up going to the hospital anyway. - That just sounds like such a nightmare. It's so scary. Having to move around, and having to make those decisions. - Well, yeah, I mean, 'cause you never know what's gonna happen and... - Yeah, right. And really I have no problem with the hospital, there are a lot of things I don't feel like I need to do at my house, maybe this is one of them, I don't know, we'll see. - [Woman 2] Ginger tea and double espresso. - Thank you. - You could always just do it the way they used to, where they just knock you out with ether and then you wake up and you got one. - Something, some an, some ad... - Yeah, no, I would love to do something like that - Yeah. - Amanda. Hey. - Hey, how are you? - Good, how are you? - Yeah! - What's going on? - Not much, this is my friend Evan. - Hello, hi. - Hi. - This is Merrill. - Merrill, hey, it's good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. What's shakin'? I saw you inside, I wanted to come out and say hi. - Oh, well, hello! - Hello. - It's been a long time. - Yeah, it has. - How's everything going? - Good, good. I saw Annette Milner last weekend. - Oh, you did? - She says hi. - What is she up to? ls she all right? - She's good. - She hates my guts, doesn't she? - No, no, no, no. - A little bit. - No, no, she's great. She's great - That didn't work out very well. - Yeah. Well, what can you do? - What can you do? I was hanging outwith Jeannie a few nights ago. And we were talking and hanging out a little bit, and she talked about the store and... - Yeah. - She's got a lot on her mind I think. - Yeah. It's been tricky lately. I mean, I've been gone a lot and we haven't really been able to talk a lot about what's been going on. But I'm sure we will. - Right. - I just... lt's been tough. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I just feel like she... I know that she hopes that you guys can kinda find some middle ground and I think she's kinda struggling how to get there. - Right. - A little bit. You know what I mean? - Yeah! I mean, me too. We'll see... - And I don't even know if it's appropriate for me to say this right now but... I think one of the things that's really weighing on her especially is the possibility that you might, potentially be considering perhaps, possibly suing her, in relations to all this sort of stuff. - L don't think I really feel comfortable talking about that with you, actually, but, clearly I don't wanna do that. - Right. - And she doesn't wanna do that. - Yeah, it sounds like a huge hassle. - It's a huge expense. - Right. Pain in the ass. The whole thing. - Yeah. - Well, you know, did she ask you to talk to me'? - No, no. I mean she didn't know that we'd run into run another. - Right, of course not - It's just on her mind and I thought, you know, I saw you, and I thought I would just, I dunno... - Check in? - Check in. Anyway, never mind. How's your summer going? - Great. How about you? - It's going all right, it's going all right. Hot. - Yeah. - Uh-huh, it's going fine. All right, I won't keep you any longer- - Yeah, we have to go. - It was nice meeting you, nice seeing you. - Nice to see you too. - I'll see you later. Bye. Hey, Jeannie, it's Merrill, how you doing? Gimme a buzz when you get a chance. Yeah, I don't know if you know but Amanda's back in town. I actually just bumped into her and we chatted, and I sorta, kinda, definitely think that she's gonna sue you. - You know, she's not a liar, it's just that she, you know, she sees everything from this alternate universe where throwing a cheese and cracker party is as important as running the business every day. - Right, but she would probably say running the cheese and crackers thing is really important for the business and was a huge success. - Well, I'm not saying that she's not adding something to the business but you know, so does the exterminator who comes and kills the mice. H's like, it's just so unbalanced and unfair. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I would probably say you two are in agreement on that. I think that's fair to say. Hey do you know, is Amanda by any chance pregnant? No? No? 'Cause when I was at the coffee shop earlier today I could've... She was talking about some dude and I could have sworn she said something like that. I couldn't hear everything, but that's sort of the vibe that I got. You don't know what I'm talking about? No. All right. Never mind... All right, so, you know what? I was thinking this earlier, one thing that's sort of... Of all the things that are kind of ambiguous and amorphous about the language in the contract, one thing that actually is pretty well defined I think, are the conditions for buyout. Which presumably, you know, Amanda's dad included in there with the notion of buying you out someday. Right? But, obviously that goes both ways. So, theoretically, you know, that's something we can use to our advantage just as well. - But we would need a buyer. - [Merrill] Right. Well, that's what I mean, if we had a buyer we could do it. - Hey, Lau, welcome home! - [Merrill] What about that dude Don? And all those other guys that have their own shops? - [Jeannie] Hey, welcome home! - Hey. - Hey. - How are you guys doing? - [Merrill] Good, how are you? - Good. - Good trip? Long trip. - [Jeannie] Don's a tyrant and the other guys, they don't have any money. - Really? - [Jeannie] Hey, Lauren. - [Lauren] Yeah? - [Jeanie] Marco called, he said he definitely has work for you next week, just give him a call. - [Lauren] Awesome. - [Jeannie] And I got those messages about A.C. - Oh yeah, that was a trip. - Guess who has a crush on you? - [Lauren] Who? - Yann the bartender. - All right. - [Jeannie] So was A.C. kinda crazy? - Yeah, he's a weird guy. - [Jeannie] But wasn't he in a mental institution for a few seconds? - [Lauren] I hadn't heard that. No, I just thought he was kind of a weird dude. - [Jeannie] It was his father... - Maybe he got weirder. - [Jeannie] His dad I think had him, what's the word, what's the word? - Committed? - [Jeannie] Yeah, something like that. Yeah. I don't know. - I've gotta pee and go to bed. - [Jeannie] Okay. Bye. - But I do have some stories to tell you. - [Jeannie] Oh, yeah? - The saddest and quickest of which is that, A.C. told me that Daniel had died. - [Jeannie] Ooh. - Some heart thing, I dunno. Some kinda like, unexpected heart failure, maybe drug related, maybe not. So, this is my first boyfriend, like from high school. - [Merrill] Oh. I'm sorry. - I've never kissed a dead guy. - Maybe if you were a better girlfriend in high school he'd still be alive today. - [Lauren] Maybe so. - Sorry, that sounded horrible. That came out totally wrong. I'm sorry. - [Lauren] I don't know. It's been a long day. - Why would I say that? That was terrible. - [Lauren] It's always good to see you, Merrill, I'm gonna head to bed. - Night, Lauren. In my mind it sounded so different than the way it came out. It sounded hilarious. It came out so not hilarious. - [Jeannie] Yeah, I guess not. No. - Why would I do that? That was terrible. - [Jeannie] You didn't know Daniel. - I didn't know Daniel. But that's really no excuse. - That lake is looking kinda grody. - Yeah. - Kind of swampish. How 'bout the fence? . Okay" - [Jeannie] Oh, that's a great one. Let me back up. - Let me see it. - [Jeannie] No, no, just stay in the moment! - Let me see that. - No, man, if you look at it every time we'll... Gs mus on your 'm. - [Lauren] Okay. Fucker. - Thank you for doing this. - (chuckles) Okay. (birds chirping) How about upside down? - [Jeannie] Yeah, go for ii. - Is that too crotch? - [Jeannie] A little... Ha! Oh, damn. Ah, I missed the moment. That is fantastic. - All right. - [Jeannie] Wait, I gotta zoom out again. Shit, I missed it! Can we go back? You're hard to catch, dude. . Okay" - [Jeannie] Oh, I love it. I love it, I love it. Will you do your hands again? - Like this? - [Jeannie] Yeah! - It feels kinda weird to be objectified by you. - I didn't realize that so much. Cow shit would be involved. (laughing) Let's do that fence over there. - Okay, awesome! - You think you can do this path? Looks kind of like a trap. - It's kinda boggy. - You up for it in that dress? - I may split a seam but, it's your dress. - You're already muddy. - Just gotta get your chair. . Oh! - I got it. - I'll just get the camera. - [Jeannie] The Green, in the Green. - [Lauren] Dude, Scott and his brother just walked in. - [Jeannie] Are we hiding? It would be hard to hide in the Green Beaner. - Nah, I don't want to be a coward about it. - Well you don't have to lean out like that. (laughing) (indistinct chatter) - Hey, how's it going? - Hey. Lee, how are you? - Good, good. Hi, I'm Lee. - Do you know my sister? Jeannie? - No, hi, nice to meet you. - What's up? - Listen, Emeka's gonna call you tomorrow. . Who? - Emeka, the administrator. I work for him. - Okay, great right, sorry. - Listen, I was totally pushing for you to get the job, he had other plans, plans to not hire you, but, we've had a situation come up with one oi our teachers. Not really supposed to talk about it, you know what I'm saying. - Yeah, no I don't really, but... - Well, basically we're eating a shit sandwich right now. It doesn't work for us but it could work for you if you're willing lo hop on an airplane and fly to Nairobi next week. - Hey, Jeannie... - I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. - Ahem. Next week. - Next week. - Okay. - I mean it's Emeka's deal, he's gonna call you probably or, definitely. - Great. - Cool, well, listen, I'm gonna go tend to my brother. Nice meeting you, nice seeing you. - Yeah. It's good to see you! - You ladies have a good afternoon. - [Jeannie] Tell Scott I said hey. - Yeah, me too. - Heart rate monitor? - No, just regular. - Nairobi is the third largest city in Africa. - Been doing some reading on Nairobi? - I'd go if I were you. - [Lauren] We'd need a subletter. - Hi, Scott. - Pardon me. - [Lauren] Hello, Scott. - L'm trying to remember, why did we break up again? - Are you serious? - Hey, Jeannie, I can drive if you want. - No, it's all right, I'm fine. - Maybe I'll put this in the trunk. Hey, Jeannie, could you open the trunk, please? Yeah, so I think between the both of us we'll charm his pants off. - I just don't wanna cramp your style that's all. - You're not gonna cramp our style. Not at all. In fact, I mean, Tom is a very like, he's a very mellow easygoing dude, I think it will take a lot to cramp his style. - Okay. - I really do. - How do you know him, anyway? - We met in rehab when I was 19. Along time ago. - Okay. - Yeah. - Cool. - Yeah, he's a good guy. - Anyway, that's the bingo thing. - Oh, right, okay. (chuckles) Have you ever played that game where you spot cars and you put the word anal in front of the model type? - No. - You ever done it? H's pretty fun. Here, like this car here. Whoa, this is an interesting car. - I have no idea what that is. - That would be an Anal Accord, I think. - We have reached an Anal Accord. - Yeah. - And this one here... I don't know what that is. - Anal Cougar? - [Jeannie] No. - I think it was an... This would be an Anal Pathfinder. Right, so what if we go to her and we say how about you give us an offer to buy us out of the business, right? And then she low-balls us and boom we've already got a counteroffer ready. - Wait, why does she need to offer first? - And if that doesn't work, we drop a huge piano on her head. And her potential unborn child. - I'm listening to you, Merrill. - Of course. You want salsa? Where is our salsa? Well, I'll get some. - Other people have it. I think it's totally funny how you're delegating all your stress to Merrill. - Not all of it. Can I borrow your phone? - Yeah. (Phone ringing) - Hang on for one second. Storyville. (sighs) Hi, I'm here. Jeannie, did you get my message? - No, what was it about? - Well, the cash register tape got stuck, and none of the command keys would work on it after that and... - Ah... Okay. Muchas gracias. - Mmm-hmm. - How did it jam? - [Merrill] So tell me about jury duty, what was it like? - [Lauren] Well, have you never done it? - [Merrill] Mmm-mmm. Never been called. - [Lauren] Mmm-hmm. - I got it out with a pen, but, now, just, every, the whole system has shut down. - Well, you may just have to write down, you know, hand write people's receipts. - The cash, I can't get to the cash because, you know, it's not working, so do you want me to just give people change from my pocket or... - Oh, no don't do that. What about like, what about the credit card machine? ls that up? - Being a good American- - No one ever really talked to me, I just waited. Had a coffee break. - Is anybody waiting now? - Yeah, there is somebody waiting, she's been very, very patient so... - Right, okay, well, just take a sticker and write on the back of ii. "$10 off your next purchase" and sign it. You know, just apologize to the woman and tell her we can't really do transactions right now and we'll just hope she comes back. Yeah, I'll wait while you do that. Yeah. - Do you ever think about selling your half of the business? - I am so sorry, this is my boss and she wants me to give you this $10 off coupon. Let me take that and I'll put it on hold and, You can come back and get it with that coupon. Okay? I'm so sorry. Okay, I just told her. - Call Michael and see if he can come in and give you a hand. And, if you can't get a hold of him, try Amanda. You know, actually, let me just... I'll just call you back in 10 minutes. You know if you... You might need to close the store down, but I know you can do that and, you know I'm just not worried about ii, I know you can handle it. So, I will talk to you in a little bit? All right. Well, good luck! Okay. - [Merrill] ls everything cool? - [Jeannie] Yeah, just, cash register fuck up, you know. - You're awesome. - It's true. Salsa? - Oh, yeah. Thank you for getting this. - It's really hot, be careful. - Scorching. - [Merrill] So how much of a financial hit do you think this is gonna be? - [Jeannie] Eh, it's a Monday, it's not too big a deal. - [Merrill] Ballpark. - I don't have my wallet. It's not in here. - Where's it'? - Let me try the car. - When did you last use it? - [Lauren] Well, I had it at the restaurant for sure. - You did have it at the restaurant? - [Lauren] Yeah, I bought my lunch. - We could just call 'em. - What was the name of the place? Do you remember'? - I have no idea. - It's like... Cruz, wasn't it? Something Cruz, or something? La Cruz or something? - [Lauren] I have no idea. - Yeah. - What town was it in? Do you remember the town? - Well, anyway, it's not that far back I know, 'cause I still feel my food in early phases of digestion. - Well, we're already really late. - 25 minutes, here and there. - Yeah, there's no way. - What do you think we should do? - Wait, how far is where you're going from Mom's house? 'Cause if you could drop me there I could probably get a car from one of them and drive back myself. - Yeah, that's doable. What was the name of the street? - [Merrill] Baker. - You think we might have passed it? - [Merrill] I don't know. - [Jeannie] I haven't seen any of those numbers, the road numbers. Have you seen any? - The addresses? No, I haven't seen any addresses. - [Jeannie] Should we give him a call? - How the fuck are we gonna call him, Jeannie? Your phone is busted, Lauren took her phone. - Where's your phone? - My phone's on my fuckin' dresser back home! You know, I didn't plan it like this. This is not... Okay, actually, there it is. There's the cross street, so it's three blocks up on the left. Two blocks after this light, I think. - Okay, so when we get there, just jump out, I'll park the car. - No no, it will only take another minute. We should go in there together. - [Jeannie] Merrill, just get out of the car, okay? . Okay" - Hey, Tom. Hey. How's it going, man? - Good. Good lo see you. - Good to see you as well, sorry I'm late. - Yeah, didn't you have, you're bringing a friend or- - Yeah, yeah, she's parking the car. Cool. How are you? (birds chirping) (car beeping) - [Jannie] Excuse me, hey, sir'? Excuse me. Sir? Can you help me? Sir? Shit. - [Man 1] Yes. - Hi, hi, could you give me a hand? - Sure. - Thank you. - You okay? - My wheelchairs in the back and, uh, could you... - [Man 1] I can't really hear you. - I use a wheelchair. - [Man 11 Uh-huh. - It's in the back of the car. Would you mind, if pop the trunk, could you... - Sure. - Could you grab it for me? - Sure, I'll get it for you. - Thank you so much. - That's okay. - It's in pieces but I can put it together if you just bring up the pieces that'd be great. . Okay" - Yeah, just hang on, let me get it. - Let me help you here. - No, well, if you could just get the other wheel that would be great. ' Okay, ' Okay? - All right. - Thanks. - I remember this friend of mine, his dad died like really young and I remember being relieved that they weren't that close 'cause I thought, "Well, it won't be that hard for him because he didn't like him that much," but, that was total BS. I mean that's like, he was really close to him and so, I dunno... I think I got really close to her right at the end 'cause we flip-flopped like roles, so I was the caretaker. And she was very resistant to that but once she kinda like... - And now it's like I got this weird job where I'm supposed to like take care of all her affairs, and it's like the desk job I've never had in this weird way. I dunno. - That's Jeannie. - No? All right. See you later. - [Merrill] No, I'll be right back. - Oh. - [Merrill] He)'- - [Jeannie] Hey, sorry that took so long. - [Merrill] Oh, that's okay, it's all right. - Hey. - Hi. - Tom. - Hi, I'm Jeannie. - Jeannie, nice to meet you. - You too. - Tom, Jeannie. Jeannie, Torn. So yeah, so, thanks again for you know, meeting up with us and taking time out of your day. - Yeah, thanks. - Se, I kinda wanted to let Jeannie do most of the talking about the business, about her business. But the basic situation... The basic situation is, Jeannie runs a small used and vintage clothing shop and her partner in the business is considering perhaps getting out. So we're just kind of, you know, we're just putting feelers out there and kind of trying to assess what some of our options might be, but we're thinking of maybe having someone come on board to buy out the other business partner. - Right. - And assume a 50% ownership stake in the business. And Jeannie would continue to run the business on a day-to-day level as she has been doing. Right? That's basically it. I mean, it's a small shop, it's never gonna be like a huge profit generator, but you know, I feel like because of its reputation, because it's established, it's kind of at a point now where... You know, ii kind of generates a pretty modest income reliably. You know, and... I don't know, is that kind of it for the overview, am I leaving anything out there? - No, you got it. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's really it's, it's a great place to be, I'm there all the time and, it's a really kind oi a politically conscious area and so people are into the small business, you know, wanna see 'em do well. So, you know, ifs a good place to be. It feels really supportive and... - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, and there are a lot of young people that are kind of moving into the neighborhood more and more. People with like a disposable income, which I think economically is beneficial you know, and, a little bit of a renaissance happening in the neighborhood, which is nice. - Yeah, yeah, it's good. I mean it's not the kind of thing where they are coming in and you know, tearing everything down and building up chains, and, you know it's not that kind of renaissance. - [Merrill] Yeah, I don't even know the nearest chain located to the store. - Yeah, who knows? - [Tom] How long has it been there? - Well, the stores been there for about 9 years in one form or another but... - [Merrill] Well there is actually that 7-Eleven that is like four or five blocks away to the south. - Me and Amanda started talking like couple years ago. I knew the owners before and, a couple years ago we started talking about taking it over and it seemed like a good idea. - At the time. - [Jeannie] Well, yeah, I mean, it was a good idea at the time. I mean, it's still a good idea, it's just... The day to day is, you know... It's actually a lot more fun than you think. I have a good time being in there. - [Tom] I'm sure it's great. - It's a fun shop, it's really nice, a lot of cool stuff. - It's... Yeah. - You guys gonna get coffee? - I'm okay. - Yeah. - Small business, support - All right, okay, fair enough. You want something? Okay, yeah, how 'bout a... Tai... Chai... A chai tea latte? - [Merrill] A tai chi latte? - Yeah. - What size? - Medium. - [Merrill] Medium, you got it. You all set? - [Tom] I'm good. - [Merrill] You sure? - [Tom] So do y'all have this, do you guys have like a brochure or a business plan or something? - Yeah, Merrill's got something. - We've got this guy, this family accountant that kind of looks at that stuff sometimes? He can, he's more savvy than I am about numbers. - Yeah, well it's not... I mean it's not exactly a business plan, it's just, you know, it just kind of tells a little bit about what we do and who we are and that kind of thing. - [Tom] Right, right. It sounds intriguing. Because, you know, I have a little bit of money now, I guess? A little bit. Did he tell you that? - Yeah, he mentioned it. - [Tom] I guess that's why you're here huh? - Well, you know... - [Tom] You're not here to like see the sights, per se? - My mom lives in town. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Right. L'd like to be your guy but I don't know if I'm your guy. - Well, we'll get you that stuff and you can just take a look at it, maybe come to the store sometime. Do you ever make it to Austin? - [Tom] I don't know. I was there like a year and half ago. For a thing. - Yeah. - [Tom] I used to go see bands and now I don't, they won't let me in 'cause I'm too old. They're like, "Sorry grandpa, no." - Sally's special? - Yeah. - Special salad. Nice. - Hey, Merrill, come on in! - I can do ii in my sleep. . Hey- . Hey- - Distinguished gentleman. - The lady of the house. One of the ladies of the house. - Sure. - The very classy ladies of the house. - Yes, thank you. - She called me distinguished gentleman so I didn't know... - Dude, it's over, whatever! - We already have the photo albums, I don't know what we really need with them being digitized. - Yeah, but the glue kinda wears out, they start flying all over the place. - And you can't watch a slide show with the... - I guess you got a longer view than I do. - And you can email 'em to people. - It was so beautiful, everywhere you looked it just was so... - ls that some kind of botanical garden. - So gorgeous. And there are these wild roosters running around. All over the place. Wild roosters! - I told Lauren that I'd pull out my checkbook right there. - Really? - I mean, I don't know if the information ever got to Jeannie and, you know, I guess I'm okay with it but... - Right. Well, you know, I can't speak for either of them, right? - Well, just, if the last line of defense is like pushy Sally, you know kinda, being... You know, you can make fun of me and be the butt of your jokes, I don't mind, if it keeps Jeannie in business. I'm okay with that. - Well, good, I mean, I think that's great to hear, that's great to know, you know, and to the extent that my opinion actually matters in any of this I would definitely advocate, at least- - [Jeannie] Merrill? .Yep- All right, yeah, we gotta go. I gotta go, for sure. - Wallet. - What up, champ? - How you doing? - Fuckin' ready? - You ready to whoop ass? - Yeah. Fuckin' pumped. - Just like the SAT's you know, I stayed up till four in the morning. - Mmm-hmm! - Got my coffee, had power diarrhea earlier today. - We're gonna fuckin' kick ass and take names. - You think so? - Yeah. - Why do you take names when you kick ass? - Lauren. Hello, Lauren, hey, this is Lee. - Yeah, yeah, no I'm... - It's getting down to the wire, we kinda need to know your decision. - Yeah, yeah, I wanna go. - [Michael] Your nemesis was in. - Do you need me to give you more stuff to do? - No, I'm fine. Got plenty. - (softly) ls somebody crying back there? - Corinne. She just had a freak out at the end of her shift. I don't know, it's like personal stuff. Why don't you go back in there, it's your store? - Did we get any calls? - Yes. The Chronicle returned your call, the billing was a mistake and we were billed for double price because there were two different ads. - Wait, it was a mistake? - Was not a mistake. - Wasn't a mistake. Two ads. Fuck. (Phone ringing) - Storyville. Yes, we're open till 8 o'clock every day. Mmm-hmm. Even on Sunday. Okay, bye. - Do you mind running over across the street to pick up The Chronicle? - No. - Thanks. Can I come in? - Yeah, of course. (sniffling) I'm just gonna get myself together and leave. (sniffling) - Was Michael being a jerk? - No, it wasn't him. - Sorry, I won't ask any more questions, I'll just... I'm here if you wanna talk. - L feel really silly right now. - Just come on in. - What? What? What's going on? - I just... I just get these violent fantasies... - [Lauren] Hello? - Hello... How's it going? Oh, hey. Weird. - I'm sorry. - [Merrill] What's going on? - Good, how was the bar? - It was- - Did you kick its ass? - I didn't kick its ass, no. Well today was day one, there's two more days. . Okay" Two more days to kick ass, and tomorrow is multiple choice. - All right. - Which is good. - Oh, that's a good thing? - That's a very good thing. - Okay. Excellent. Well, you'll kick its ass tomorrow perhaps. Or we men day, or bum. - I gotta start kicking ass soon. - Hey, sit down. - Time is running out. You don't have to get up, ifs okay. - No, whatever, get comfy. I'm just kind of... - [Merrill] I would love to lie down for a second. - Yeah. - [Merrill] That would be great, thank you. - It's your day of... - [Merrill] Of mourning? - You must be worn completely out. - [Merrill] Aww, shit. - What did they have you, at one of those little desks with the pencil holders... - Yep. - And the like... - [Merrill] And the chaperon about four feet away staring at me. Did you wanna lie down? I didn't mean to kick you off the bed? 'Huh? - [Merrill] I didn't mean to kick you off the bed, you can lie down. - Ah... - [Merrill] Lie down, please, I feel bad. - That'd be all right. So Merrill, have you... Do you know many... (sighs) Do you know many dead people? - Do I know many dead people? - Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah, like... - I know a handful of dead people. I don't know many. - [Lauren] Are they together in your mind? - Well, I guess most of them have been... {electricity crackles) Whoa.! What was that? - Okay. - [Lauren] Okay, like... - That was bizarre. - Do you think that could have... Could have been a message from a dead person? - Wow, I dunno, from the other world? - Yes, speaking through light fixtures. That is kind of classic ghosty, isn't it? - That was so weird. It could be, I dunno. What do you think... If there was a message, I mean, if you were that ghost trying to communicate something to us using the light bulb as the funnel. - Uh-huh? - What would you say, what would be your message? - I would say... "Good luck on the bar." - Really? - Yeah, I mean, if he was funneling into your brain. - Well, if he was funneling sure. That's nice, that's a polite ghost. - [Lauren] What do you think it would say? - Very friendly. T“ you'? - [Lauren] Sure. - Well, if I was the ghost funneling, in that situation to you, I would say... Let me think about it for a second. I would say, "Lauren, don't go to Kenya." That's my honest answer, my honest funnel. - Jeannie will be fine. You'll obviously be fine without me, but Jeannie will definitely pull through. I honestly, I don't think I do a whole lot to defray any of the stress around here, if anything I probably add to it. - No, I disrespectfully... Well, I respectfully disagree. H's very respectful. - Say it, you were being disrespectful. - No, it was a very respectful disagreement. - What do you think the judge is gonna make of that? - I don't know, but the counsel objects to your statement. - "Contempt!" - See you're gonna be great. "Irrelevant!" - Good, 'cause I know what an objection is? - Yeah. 'Cause you've watched L.A. Law. - Unfortunately, you need a little more these days than that. (inhales deeply) - Hi. - Hi. - You wanna come inside? I can give you a lift? - No, I'm irritated right now. I don't want a lift. . Okay" I told you I wanted to try some new artwork for the store. - You can't just take out an ad without telling me! - I did tell you! I mean, to me, I said it and that means I'm gonna do ii. - You know, I just never- - I'm not sure you really wanna work with a partner. - I do, I do. A partner would be great. I don't... But I don't feel like you're a partner. I mean, I feel like... I feel like this is a hobby for you. - It's not a hobby, it's just that I'm not you! You know, I was talking to Robert, and others too, and trying to figure out how to fix it and I just... I feel like it just might be too late. - It's not too late, I mean we're talking. I mean, I'm listening. - There are so many ways in which I disagree with you, but I'm honestly afraid that anything I say is gonna feel like an attack to you. And I don't... - [Jeannie] I'm sure... - I don't want you to feel that way about just me saying what I think! Especially because I really don't wanna hurt you. After all this, I know it sounds crazy, but I just, that's not what I want. - [Jeannie] Amanda, you're like the strongest person I know. I never... (sighs) I never would have done this without you. It's just, I wouldn't have had the courage to even start it. - But after we started it, then what was I? What was I supposed to be? - [Jeannie] Equal partners, I mean that was, that's the idea... Corinne's doing good. - Good. - [Jeannie] She worked out. - Did you get to talk to Kendra at all about why she quit? - Got a better job, better pay I guess. What, is this one of the mean things you're gonna tell me'? - [Amanda] It could be. Yeah. - Okay what, I'm a shitty boss? I'm no fun, I send mixed messages, what? Just, never mind, don't even bother, it's not important. - Actually it is important, and that's exactly what I'm talking about! - I could probably come up with some mean things to say to you too but I just, you know, it doesn't come as naturally to me. . Okay" I take full responsibility for the fact that I should have said months ago. Everything I do, I'm just getting pushed out, I'm being made to look like a flake, I'm not a flake, I've never been a flake! - I've never tried to push you out! I don't know... Maybe we just need to have clear guidelines as to who does what so it feels fair. - Yeah maybe, like real business partners. - Right, I mean, Robert probably has some ideas. Other people might, I don't know. - Yeah. Well, I'm sure everyone has ideas. I can't even... At the moment I feel like there's 50 ideas in my head and I don't really even know how to think about them. - I wanna write you that check before I forget. The $630. - Great. - [Jeannie] I even brought my checkbook. Do you have a pen, though? - Yeah. (door opens) (door closes) - Thanks. You know, Merrill told me he saw you the other day and said he overheard something about you being pregnant? - Yeah, but I haven't really told people, but, yeah. - Sorry. - No, it's okay, I'm excited, it's just so weird. - Yeah, congratulations, that's really cool. - [Amanda] Thank you. Yeah, it is cool, but strange. - You know, all the more reason for us to get through this. You don't want the baby to be all psychologically imprinted. - Yeah, I think the baby will be okay. H's kind of like a vaccine, you know? - Yeah. - It's a big kitchen. - Yeah, we think it's pretty nice. Have you seen many places? - Just two. - Okay. - This is nice. - Living room. - Do you think? (knock on the door) - It's cerulean. - It's the best I could do. - Is that how you pronounce it, cerulean? - [Lauren] Hey, Jeannie? . Hey- - [Lauren] Hey, I wanted you to meet Jin. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Jeannie. - [Jin] I'm Jin. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, Merrill. - Jin. - Nice to meet you. - [Jin] Oh, are you two twins? - [Lauren] Yeah. - I'm not related. - All white people kinda look alike. - [Merrill] That's what I hear. Yeah, we're still waiting for the blood work. - What do you do, Jeannie? - [Jeannie] I have a clothing store. - Oh, yeah? - [Jeannie] It's vintage and some local artists. How 'bout you? - I'm actually about to start pharmacy school. - [Jeannie] All right. - Yeah. - Cool. - Parents are proud. (Merrill chuckles) - [Jeannie] Awesome. Congratulations. - Do you live here, Merrill? - No I'm just passing through, visiting. - That's good. - Well, I guess we'll leave you to it. - All right. Take care. - Just wanted to say hello. - Nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you. Bye. - What do you think, suitable replacement? - [Jeannie] For Lauren? - Mmm-hmm. - If she does her dishes. - How you doin'? - I'm all right. Stop it. No biting. Do that again. Sorry, I just wanted to see you crack your head. - Mmm-hmm. - How come you're so good to me when you're in crisis mode? You don't see ii that way? - No, I don't see it that way. - Well, how do you see it? - (sighs) Man, when things get normal... God... I'm just really... You're saying... I'm a clutch player when it comes to crisis mode, but when it doesn't matter I don't care, is that basically what you're saying? - Pretty much exactly. We're on the same wavelength. - So what do you think, I'm just going to get boring? - You don't get boring, you get bored. - Crisis turns me on, baby. Honey, I'm not in crisis mode. I can take the bar again in six months. You know what happens six months after that? - What? - They offer it again, and then again and again. The bar will always be there for me. You, on the other hand, young lady... (phone chiming) (Phone ringing) - Oh, Jeannie! Don't answer. - I won't... (Phone ringing) - Who is it'? - Marco tried calling earlier. My cell phone. - You don't wanna talk to him? - L just don't feel like talking to anyone really. - Did you let him down with the landscaping job? - Yeah, but like, even folks that aren't mad at me. Is Merrill staying over? - I suppose so. - That's exciting. - It's not official. . Okay" It's still exciting. - What's up? - Very unofficial. - What's unofficial? - Nothing. Sorry. - I love you too. - Anyway, I guess this is, you know... - Well I'm on the airport team tomorrow, right? - Sure. - Oh, okay, all right. I guess I'll finish my packing and try to get some sleep. - Good night. - Night. - You nervous? - Of course, I'm a little nervous. - [Jeannie] Me too. See ya. - [Merrill] Good night. - [Lauren] Good night, you guys. - Hi Scott, it's Lauren. Hey, so I guess you know I'm going to Africa tomorrow? Yeah, well, I was just... I was just calling to see if you felt, were sorta in the mood maybe for a little... A little hang out time, tonight, maybe? You know, live on the edge, a little spontaneity? (chuckling) Oh, God, no. No, just like, you don't have to over think it. Just kind of, doesn't have to really be anything. Yeah, okay. Yeah, no, I gotcha. You don't have to say it twice. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Going for number three? - Mmm-hmm. Is that just greed? ls that too much? - It's too much. - Too much. - Too greedy. - Fair enough. Fair enough. So, now that were sleeping together, well, do you think ifs okay if I see other girls? No? No, okay, that was a joke by the way. I don't know if you caught that, that was hilarious. - Yeah, it was hilarious. - Just trying out new material, see what works. - Whatever. - Sort of, research and development of... Yeah. How about breakfast? You wanna go to mi Madre's? We can get some migas at mi Madre's. - Can I tell you something? - Mmm-hmm. -L, um... - "You um..." - "You..." - “Um... - What? - What were you gonna say? - What? You seem to know. What was I gonna say? - I don't know. - You used to say... - What did I used to say? - Here, could I tell you something? - Yeah. - I love you. - You're not my boyfriend. - (muffled) ls this how you express your affection? Asphyxiating your boyfriend? - I'm not your girlfriend, you're not my boyfriend! - Uh-huh. By asphyxiating your lawyer? - You're definitely not my lawyer. - What am I then? Hey, Lauren. Oh, don't do that, don't do that. Me and Jeannie were just talking about going out and getting a big breakfast. What do you think? Migas. Migas at mi Madre's. . Okay" Do we have time though? - What do you think? - What time do you have to be at the airport? - 11:00. - You have to be there at 11:00? - Yeah. - Yeah, we have plenty of time. Not plenty of time, but we have enough time. - Just go on the way? - Yeah, for sure. - That sounds good. - Do those refrigerate? - Yeah, it should. - Yeah? Put 'em in the fridge. . Okay" - What would you like to wear'? How's this shirt? What do you think? - I got it under control, Merrill. - Yeah? Like the multi-layered red? You wanna wear this? - I'll be ready in a minute. - Oh, no. - What? (clicks tongue) What? What is it? - Ooh, you just got this? - Yeah, I just opened the mail. Nice language, huh? - Oh, it's beautiful. - Breakfast? - [Lauren] Yes. - [Merrill] Definitely. - [Jeannie] What's going on? - [Merrill] Nothing. - What was that? - [Merrill] Nothing. - [Lauren] Talk about it after breakfast? - [Merrill] Yeah, exactly, I was gonna tell you after breakfast. - Tell me now, what is it? - [Merrill] It'll be a surprise after breakfast. - Lauren, tell me now. - Poo-poo platter for dessert It's a letter from Amanda's lawyer. - [Merrill] Amanda has retained legal counsel. - What does that mean? - [Merrill] She got a lawyer. She's suing you. - Is that what it's... - And it's okay, we're gonna work through this, and I'm gonna do everything in my power to help you, and she's gonna send good vibes and good thoughts from the afterlife, and Nairobi, and everything's gonna be fine. - I'm not gonna die. - Everything's gonna be all right. - No plans to... - But right now, we need to have breakfast and we're not gonna think about this bullshit. All right? Because that's exactly what it is, fucking bullshit. - Yes, it's bullshit. - Right. So, let's do it. - Or I can just not go. - [Lauren] Which maybe makes the most sense. I mean... - Not go to breakfast? (Lauren laughing) - No, to Kenya! Whatever. I said yes under duress. They can find someone else. - [Jeannie] Dun”: back out of this, this is good. - [Lauren] Definitely get someone to fill in for me. - Either way, we need breakfast. - [Lauren] Yes, breakfast! - So, lets just get that in there and then we'll get it up here. All right, let's do it. - Yeah. - Yeah, I guess so. - Come on, let's roll. - Jesus Christ, ladies, come on! Vamos! - Come on. - Jeannie. I should stay.
