Go, Hapoel Petah Tikva! Go, Hapoel! This guy's wife dies. The undertakers come, 3rd floor, no elevator. They carry her down. When they turn the corner in the stairwell she slips, falls, stands up, alive! A few years go by, she dies again. The undertakers come, put her on a stretcher, in the stairwell her husband says to them: "Hey! "Watch that corner!" This is from me to Radi. Wait a sec! Enjoy, Radi. - Thanks. Asher, keep an eye on the chicken. Asher, happy birthday. - Happy birthday! Thanks, Dad. Enjoy. Nice one. - Happy birthday. Look at Milo's son, these muscles are from scaffolds, not the gym. Happy birthday, Asher! Cheers! To your health and happiness. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday, dear Asher! Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Asher! Is that the new shirt, Asher? You bet it is. Feel how soft. A real Lacoste? Sure is, you moron, cost 80 bucks. Let me feel it. Looking sharp, huh? Stop with the phone. I swear, they put something in them that gets you hooked, catches your eye... Who's they? The mobile networks. They put something electronic so you keep looking at it. How do you know? Look at Ahmed, he had a birthday, too. Happy birthday! Happy birthday, Ahmed! He got a shirt from Daddy, too. Turn around. Here he goes again. Where'd you get the shirt? There was a big sale. Hugo Boss, Lacoste... Take it off. - No, no... Take it off before I fuck you up! Asher, school isn't only for grades, it's also to teach you values. I didn't mean it, bro. I just told you to change the shirt. -Oh, please. Instead of focusing on your matriculation exams we're focusing on inappropriate behavior. You're wasting your father's time, making him leave work. I apologized to him, it's you who won't let it go. If this happens again... Dad, how much did the shirt cost? Yes, doctor, my surgery is on the 19th. I have a big project after that. If I don't wake up, you have Asher. Okay, on the 19th then. No, he knows the work, I can rest easy. Doctor, you know the joke about the guy whose mother-in-law is dying? She's in Intensive Care. Anyway, he goes home and starts making up a room for her. His wife says, "What are you doing? She's dying." He says, "Yeah, but we should always prepare for the worst." Okay, thank you. Stay well, doctor. I have a matric exam on the 19th. Does it have to be on the 19th? I never heard of someone taking a matric exam who can't read. How's the pasta? Good. - Good, huh? Is he a good doctor? - Yeah. He does 10 surgeries a day. Listen, Asher, you'll cover for me till I'm back on my feet. You hear me? Isn't that doll pretty, Dad? It's like a toy. Wanna play with it? How's your mother? - Fine. It's good that she has someone. Cellphones in here. Let's go. In the box. - My battery's dead anyway. Asher. - Come back to me later. It helps me concentrate, Rami. I didn't bring mine. You know... In here. 2,000 years ago people thought the Earth was flat and this Greek guy, Eratosthenes, who was a librarian in Alexandria in Egypt, home to the world's biggest library, he liked to observe. That's what he liked to do, to observe people, buildings, the sky, the stars. One day he's looking at the sunset, he sees the sun setting, he sees the moon rising and he says to himself, if the sun is round and the moon is round, then maybe the planet we live on is round, too. Isn't that nice? That would never happen today. You know why? - Why? Because the only thing people look at are their phones. People don't talk to each other. People used to tell jokes to each other. Today... it's gone. Asher's dad tells jokes all the time. Yeah? Then Asher's dad is special. Not special, very special. Right, Asher? Don't talk about my dad or I'll fuck you up. Why? What did I do? I didn't do anything. Don't touch the phone. Read a newspaper instead. No, I'll behave. No. Read the paper instead. Fine, gimme the newspaper. What is this? Why are the pages so big? Is there a sports section? There's everything. Look. On the first page - the most recent, important news. On the second page - articles on all kinds of topics. Then there's local news and global news. What else... Oh, look, obituaries. Sports, just for you. Forecast around the world. Whoa, Tokyo, 36 degrees, thunderstorms. Man, those Chinese are totally wacko. Ever been overseas? - No, never. I recommend it, at least once, on your own. Why on my own? You experience things differently. You look at the sky, it looks different. The bread tastes different. Even the way people get on a bus is different and it's fun. Rami, is he the teacher's pet? Asher. Take the hard hat. I'm gonna check out tomorrow's site, you finish up here, okay? Asher, floors 1-2. Radi, you take 3-5. And no missing boards. You do 1-2. Any problems, call me. Don't go any higher. Hi, what's up? Good morning. Good morning, how are you? Okay. What are you waiting for? Driving lesson. How many lessons have you taken? 50 or 60. Wow. In the third test, he failed me for no reason. What an asshole. - Totally. I don't know, my teacher said I was fine. Don't worry, in the end everyone passes. Okay... - Good luck. Thanks. - Bye, see you. In the middle, Yossi. Come on. - Yossi! Fuck! Come on, Asher! You guys rule! Pass it, Yossi! Come on! Good morning. - Good morning. Can I please have the history study guide? Yes. Will this be on the matric exam? Is the exam all you care about? Following our last class we'll move on to Karl Haendel's work "Questions for My Father." Your name, please? - Asher Lax. "Why did you decide to have children? "Do you wish you were taller? " Did you ever get into a fistfight? "When did you stop feeling like a boy? "Did you ever disappoint your parents? "Were you ever depressed as a young man? "Do you ever wish your life turned out differently? "Did you ever see your parents having sex?" "Did you ever wish you had a different career?" "What did you want to be? What did you want me to be? "What are your regrets? What makes you cry? "Do you think you are good looking? "When were you the happiest? "How did you learn to cook? "Why were you so angry all the time? "How close did you come to hitting me?" For homework please write why Karl Haendel asked these questions the way he did, one after the other, and write questions to someone close to you and hand it in. Okay? Great. Asher. - Are you in a lesson? Why don't you bring us here? Afraid we'll trash the library? Asher... If you don't bring us here... You're out of line. Chill, dude, it's not a real gun. Well, I'll get out of your way. Did you see us win, Rami? When I'm in the hospital, keep your phone charged. I'll be in touch with you and Radi all the time. Are they gonna put you under? Of course. He's gonna open me up and go deep into my soul. Otherwise, you think I'd take time off? My exam is on the 19th. What do you mean? I have to study a day or two before. You wanna screw up my business just to fail? Will you pass? I have a 70-point average. Even if I get a 40, I'll pass. If you get 40, you'll pass... I could get 50 without studying. 40... Lucky for you we have our business. Who needs literature and history? Dad! What emotions do we know? Anger. - Envy. Happiness. - Sadness. Hope. - Love. Relying on someone, knowing you can be relied on. To hope, to anticipate. All those are emotions, Rami? - You bet. People usually feel several emotions at once. Not just one emotion, but a combination. My sister's son loves when I tickle him. I pick him up, tickle his armpit and he laughs like crazy and wants me to tickle him harder, but then he starts crying and when I stop, he asks me for more. He feels several emotions at the same time. I wonder how your parents would react if someone tickled them. You know what? For homework, ask your parents if the child in them is still alive or if he's dead or is on the verge of dying. Holocaust Remembrance Day is coming up and I was thinking we should organize the ceremony. The big ceremony? Yes, in front of the entire school. You'll read some texts on stage, we'll choose a few songs, what do you say? Who'll let us, Rami? Get real. Let the man speak. - Biton, come here. Come on, get up. Say... - Way to go, Biton. Say... That's enough. "For our national anthem, please rise." Don't be shy. "For our national anthem, please rise." "For our national anthem, please sit." What's wrong with you? See what I mean, Rami? Shut the fuck up! Biton, say: "For our anthem, please rise" It won't work, Rami. Yossi, it'll work fine. No, it won't! - We'll rehearse, what are you so scared of? Are you nuts? We can barely read! Sit down! - Shut the fuck up! Stay out of this! You telling me to shut up? Son of a bitch! - Shut the fuck up! Hey! Yehudit, my intentions were good. I know, Rami, but preparations started a month ago. You can't just decide to organize the ceremony. It doesn't work that way. Not here, in any case. It takes preparing, discussing the details, deciding who is worthy, not getting the students involved without checking with the school first. Rami, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen. Asher, Yossi, come in. Asher. What are you doing? It's just a cigarette. - Not that. Can't you go to the restroom? Come with me. Rami, you're overreacting. - Let's go. Where to? What were you thinking? To the principal? What's gonna happen when we get there? You'll get yelled at for leaving your post. Here, Rami. What's this? The homework you gave in the library, "Questions for My Father." - Really? -Yeah. Did you put your name on it? Hey, got a pen? Thanks. Thanks. Keep it safe, it's important. Asher... Try to be less prickly, you get what I mean? Less prickly. - Cool. Are we done? Thanks. How do you feel? - I'm fine, thanks. Good. He has high blood pressure, check it before he goes in... Is that okay? Yes, don't worry about it. This is as far as you go, kid. Your dad will be fine. Dad, go Hapoel! You're drunk, bro. Stop staring at her! Leave him alone. You only live once, dude. I'll go get us some snacks, guys. Let's party! Why'd you let him go, you jerk. Let him live a little. - He's wasted. How's it going, Shiran? Hey, Asher. Only one more exam to go. In literature. We have a good teacher, we'll do fine. I handed in a paper, I hope he likes it. Hey, bro, how's it going? I handed in a paper with questions, real personal. -Personal? "Dad, how is it you're so strong in my life? "How can beating..." Let's go, dude. - And most important... He's drunk. Keep an eye on him. Come sit down. Pass these back, people. Pass these back. Who wants to read the article? Yossi? Some other time. Anastasia? Yacov. - I'll read it. Go for it. "In Fukushima, two weeks after the disaster, "two residents found a baby dolphin that washed up into the rice paddies. "It was injured, they knew he didn't stand a chance, "yet they tried to return him to sea, and one of the men said: "After all he's been through, "even if he doesn't survive, it's best he die at sea." These two men know exactly what's the right thing to do. "After all he's been through, "even if he doesn't survive, it's best he die at sea." Rami, did you always have that twitch? Yes. Since I was a kid. It's called a tic. It's tension that you feel you have to release, twitching helps that for a while but then it comes back. It's an urge to twitch, so you feel at ease. Some people have twitches in their arm, their leg, their eyes. It's always inside, in your body. Got it. Rami, how old are you, if I may ask? 41. - So is Biton's mom. What a bunch of morons. Are you married? - Yes. What does your wife do? She's a poet and a literature teacher. At our school? She used to teach immigrants here in small groups, but this year she's not teaching. Do you have kids? - No. What are you waiting for? Don't you wanna meet the people you'll love the most? How old's your wife, Rami? Bye. Bye, Rami. Bye. Please be quiet, the exam is starting now. Good luck. Yacov. We gotta do all this? Quiet, please. Chill! I just asked him a question. The instructions are on the form. I'm doing the oral exam and I'm ready. You going to the game? Those fuckers, 100 shekels a ticket. Quiet! This is a matriculation exam. Watch your mouth. We gotta go party tonight. After these exams, I'll burn the school down. If you keep talking, I'll remove you from the class! This is a matriculation exam. Keep your pants on. Add up the entire class we won't score 100, why are you so worked up? Watch your mouth! Fine, but I told you I'm doing an oral exam. Why do I have to wait so long? Those are the rules! See that teacher? She's so mean. Do you know who's testing me? The exam's hard, huh? Hey, Rami, Pnina's not testing me? No, I am. Thank you. You know history? Yes, sit down, Asher. Nice, history and literature. Economics, too? Did you bring the forms? - Yes, here. Great. I'm supposed to read you the questions. Yes. -Okay. Shall we begin? - Yes. Good luck, Asher. - Thanks. First question, chapter one: "Why did Antiochus issue his decrees and name three of them." Let me see that. "Why did Antiochus issue his decrees and name three of them." Do they want the background? What's the background? Can I name the decrees first and then the reasons? Yes. Antiochus' decrees humiliated the Jews. Okay. Okay, how... how were the Jews humiliated? Hold on. Hey, Mom. I'm taking my exam, I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. She calls me 20 times a day. - Really? Yeah, she's been driving me crazy since she moved up north. She moved? - Yeah, with Nissim. Is Nissim your brother? No, her boyfriend, they've been together for years. Back to the exam. - Okay. So how were the Jews humiliated? Give me some examples. You know the answer, Rami? Think, Asher, because you were right, they did humiliate the Jews. But what could humiliate the Jews in terms of religion? Eating pork? - Very good. What else? Wearing a yellow patch? Yes. But that happened later, during the Holocaust, remember? Let's go back to what you said first, pork. What things are important to Jews? Circumcision? - Yes. Good. What else? The Sabbath? Yes. Put circumcision and the Sabbath in a sentence. He forbade circumcisions and observing the Sabbath. Good. "Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy." Right. When I was 14 I became religious, sidelocks and all. I don't know where that came from. Interesting. Okay, second question. Rami, I'll get us something to drink. No, Asher. From the teacher's lounge. Asher, sit down. I'll be right back. Rami, you take sugar? You guys got an espresso machine? Rami, isn't this a spelling mistake? You're right. Let's correct it. Forget it, fuck them. Thank you, Rami. I really appreciate it. You better be my tester in literature, too. Rami, did you check my paper? What paper? - The questions. I will in the next few days. Okay, thanks. Excuse me, do you know where my dad is? Who's your dad? Milo, he was in that room. He's in recovery. We delayed surgery because of his blood pressure. He's in the room on the right, but just five minutes, okay, sweetie? Dad. Dad. Haemon's aim is to save Antigone. That's his aim, his mission, to save his love and persuade his father not to sentence her to death. But the exact opposite happens. Not only does he not agree, he says: "Bring me Antigone and here, "right in front of my son Haemon, I will slaughter her." And Haemon warns his father: "Antigone's death will cause another." What does he mean? He tells his father that if he kills Antigone, he'll kill him in return. Yes, but what's the other option? He tells his father, "If you hurt my fiancee Antigone, I'll kill myself," and he means it 'cause he loves her. Exactly. So there are two options. And what's the answer? What happens? Patience, Asher. Can't you tell us what happens? Open to page 67. Remember, Antigone is taken to the cave where she'll be buried alive. Creon doesn't bury the dead, he buries the living. But Rami, what happens in the end? Patience, Asher. Page 67. Yossi, do you want to read? No. Come on. Asher... - Yacov, go to the end, tell us what happens. Asher, sit down. We wanna know what happens. Yacov, don't read. Yacov, we wanna know. Yacov, don't read. Read it out loud, Yacov, everyone wants to know! He kills himself. Thank you. Get out. Why should I? Get out. - Why should I? Get out! Where's that bastard taking her? These streets are so fuckin' narrow. Nice, sweetheart. Nice and slow... You son of a whore, she's taking her test! Calm down, buddy. Don't tell me to calm down, you moron! Fucking asshole. Good one. You did it, sweetie. Rami, what's going on? Why don't you read my paper? I read it, I'm still thinking about it. You did? Really? Did you like it? You were honest and that's what counts. Rami, I apologize for what happened in class. It's just that I have a lot going on. It's okay. Rami, the bell hasn't rung yet. I'm off duty now. Hello? Hello? At the game. What? What happened? "May His great Name grow exalted." Amen. "May He give reign to His kingship "in your lifetimes "and in the lifetimes of the entire Family of Israel, now say: Amen. "May His great Name be blessed forever and ever. "Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted and lauded "be the Name of the Holy One. "May there be abundant peace from Heaven "and life upon us and upon all Israel. Now say: Amen. "He Who makes peace in His heights, may He make peace upon us "and upon all Israel. Now say: Amen." O God, full of compassion Who dwells on high Grant true rest upon the wings of the Divine Presence in the exalted spheres of the holy and pure who shine as the brightness of the heavens to the soul of Rami, son of Avigdor and Sara, who has gone to his world for charity has been donated in memory of his soul May his place of rest be in the Garden of Eden Therefore, may the All-Merciful One shelter him with the cover of His wings forever and bind his soul in the bond of life. God is his heritage... My condolences. My condolences. My condolences. "A 41-year-old male jumped to his death. "He was pronounced dead at the scene." That sentence is so cold. I knew something was wrong with him. Gimme a fucking break. I'm telling you, sometimes he wouldn't even bend down to tie his shoelaces. No one knew, not even him. He put on sunscreen this week, who does that if they're gonna jump? Face it, Asher, it's because of you. They said he didn't leave a note. He's a literature teacher, I bet he left a long letter with imagery, metaphors... And he doesn't have a sister. What do you mean? He was just screwing with us about his nephew? Cut it out, poor guy. His poor wife and parents. Good morning. - Good morning. Let's sit in a circle. Again with the circle... I said I want a circle. What for? - So we can talk. Well, this is a sad time for all of us, this tragedy during your matriculation exams, but we'll get through it together. We're here with you, for you. Did he leave a letter? Why do you ask, Asher? I wanna know, yes or no? If you don't know, just say so. It's not as simple as that. We don't know all the details. It's the type of thing that has no answers. But if we read the letter, maybe he explained himself. Who did he give the letter to? Asher, it's complicated, let's leave it at that, okay? Would you like to share what you liked most about his class? The bell. What's wrong with you? Show a little respect. He was your teacher. We could tell that... it mattered to him. You mattered to him. He never yelled at us. Is it true his dad abandoned him when he was a kid? Yes, it's true. Take it nice and slow. One of our teachers died. Was he young or old? Young. - You don't say. His dad is old, he walks with a cane, he said the mourner's prayer for him. He was buried in the new cemetery, in the wall. Dear God. Tell me about it when we get in, I'm tired. Want me to get us something to eat? No, no, stay home with me. Open the door. The Greek tragedy is one of the cornerstones of Western culture. Hello. - That's right. And who might you be? Please shut the door. Sit down. Thank you. What are your names? Names? - Avi. Nimrode. Amos. Amos. Okay. For those who were late, I'm your new teacher, Ora. So as I said to the students that were here on time, we'll pick up where you left off. Ode 3. Who's this clown? - After the conflict between Creon and Haemon... We get all the clowns. Creon's hybris comes to light when he won't take back the disgraceful act he committed. What the hell is this? Leave her alone, she's a literature teacher. Couldn't they give us a real teacher? Quiet! Notebooks out, I'm going to dictate. Whoever doesn't like it can leave. Dude, I'm gonna fuck you up. Notebooks out now. - But why? Because I said so. Ode 3. - You're dictating now? That's it, as if nothing happened? San, put your pen down! Asher, we gotta prepare for the exam! Why are you so quiet? I'm studying for the literature exam. Asher, you know who this is? That's a 50-shekel bill. Not what, who? Who's on the bill? It's Tchernichovsky, a great poet. If there's a poet on a bill, it means literature is dead. A poet or writer on money is like a pig in a synagogue. Soon no one will teach or study literature. Understand? There's 10,000 shekels here. Pay them tomorrow. It's not all about school, Asher. We have lots of work coming up. Where will you find a job outdoors, no boss and make a living? This is the best for us. Count it, count it. Make sure there's 10,000. With teachers jumping off rooftops no wonder you came out like this. What's that got to do with anything? Count it. Count like that, it'll take a week. Give it to me. You'll be graduating soon. Will you ever read a book? Read a poem? A story? Write a play? Anything? Watch this. I said, watch. Tchernichovsky. Count. Count. Smile. - Anastasia, smile. Big smile. - Great, thanks. Thank you. I heard that Rami was at last year's graduation and he read something that he wrote and it was exactly the same as he read the year before, he just changed the kids' names. You believe everything you hear? Rami was totally burnt out. Guys, come on. Yacov, Asher, go in, you'll have this photo forever. Okay, chill. San, take off your shirt a sec. Yossi, come here, bro. What is it? - Get your picture taken. Change shirts with me. Take this one. Let's do it, bro. Oz, take off your shirt so I can get my picture taken. Write your name and get your picture taken. Chin up. Great, thanks. You had yours taken, right? I wrote you down. Write me down and we're all done. Come on. - Smile. Nice, look at me. That Asher is so hot. Asher of the scaffolds! Smile! Excuse me... What do you think you're doing? Excuse me, we're in a meeting, why are you barging in? - I knocked. Listen, what about the teacher's picture? What are you talking about? Rami. We want him in our class photo. Okay. I promise to think about it. Cool. Help yourself. Enjoy. - Thanks. Close the door on your way out. I was asked about that, too. Sorry for interrupting again, but did he leave a letter? Some things are off limits. He was my teacher! Did he leave a letter? - Leave now! Who's this new teacher? Ora is our literature coordinator. Ever seen her teach? You'll make every effort to do well in the exam. Now leave. Hey, Shiran. How's it going? You got a minute? I'm looking at the literature study guide and I see all kinds of things like imagery, metaphors, contrasts. Do you know the difference between them? No, he didn't teach us that. But I got it now. Thanks. What else is new? How are you? Asher, you gonna get a truck license? Yeah, a crane license, too. I wanna do some scaffolding work in the summer. Sounds good. But you know you can't horse around with Milo. There's Rami's wife. She's pretty. She looks like a dyke. You look like a dyke. Can you imagine her and Rami having sex? I think she's pregnant. She's just fat. Wanna bet? - Sure. My condolences. What's with you, you morons? She's a singing teacher? A poet, asshole. We're sorry for your loss. We're Rami's students. - Hello. We liked him, he was the best. I'm glad to hear that. He was personal, not like the other teachers. Will his family come? - What? No, his parents are elderly, so... Which class are you in? - 12B. Did he talk about us? - Sometimes. Said we drove him crazy? Said he knew how class would begin but not how it'd end. That's true. Our exam is coming up. - Yes. Rami's gonna be in our class photo. Good. Good. Are you coming to the library? - Yeah. Study hard, okay? She has a belly, she's pregnant. God is great. Giving an offspring to his family. If she's pregnant, I feel sorry for the kid. Why? - What'll they tell him? That's what nature wanted. Now she and his parents have an offspring. Quiet. What's your problem? Show some respect. How did they arrange this so fast? These nerds plan ahead, even mourning rituals. Bunch of motherfuckers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. What a beautiful dance. Hello, everyone. The students of Class 12C initiated this gathering to unveil Rami's shelf of books that he loved and taught. Hello? Hi there, doctor. No, we're working, of course. No, I'm not working hard. Yes. No, don't worry. Thank you, doctor. Remember I was in the hospital after the prison guards beat me up? Were you in fourth grade? Third. Remember what you and Mom wrote to me? "Climb as high as you can." "Dear Daddy, "climb as high as you can." You're a good boy, Asher. Take care of that. "Polynices, whose one idea was to spill the blood of his blood "and sell his own people into slavery - "Polyneices, I say, is to have no burial." "But his brother who broke his exile to come back with fire..." I can't concentrate with that. - Okay. How old is she? - Four. Wow. I wonder what they wrote about Rami in the yearbook. I heard his students didn't get the best grades. Who said? That's what I heard. They said he was a good teacher, but the parents said he didn't focus on the exams. Who cares what they say? Did they even know him? What does it mean when someone's prickly? I think it means he's stressed out all the time. Like, when you can't study, when you can't concentrate, when you're always restless, always troubled. I thought it meant something else, like someone who gets fired up fast, like prickles. That's what I thought. Like, it's easy to tick me off, I get mad by every little thing. Yeah, someone who gets mad fast. Asher... why do you think Rami killed himself? I can't answer that. Hi. -Hi. How's it going? - Praise God. Radi. Hi. How are you? Listen. This guy gets to heaven, they say to him: "You're not on the list. Try in hell." He goes to hell, they say: "You're not on this list either." He says: "Make up your minds, 'cause I ain't going back to my wife." What are you doing? Get over here. How are you doing, Dad? Now that's a neck. This son looks out for his father. Took me to the hospital, sat at my side. You tell me you're working and I find you sitting on your ass, reading? Radi, does that seem right to you? You're here, you work, you hear me? Radi will work while you what? Want me to get you a desk, too? A tanning bed? To hell with this book! Go! I said go! Okay, guys, get to work. Get to work, Radi. There's Ronny with our class photo. Ronny, what's that? You know exactly what it is. I came out ugly, bro. Where is it? That bitch. They're all liars, what did you expect? That cunt didn't include his picture? You coming to class? - Look at Biton. She won't let us in. Who cares about class, dude? You lied to me, you're liars. Who lied to you? You did, you're a liar. I have witnesses. I said I'd think about it and I did. You have no idea what you did, I swear. Stop right here. You don't threaten anyone. You have one week to leave here with a diploma. You hear me? And that diploma is the best way for you to honor Rami's memory. The best way. Look, Asher, you studying while everyone is working doesn't look good. For 20 years if a worker lifts, so does Milo. If a worker dismantles, so does Milo. All my workers know that about me. I'm watching your back. If a worker sees you slacking off, he won't work hard for you. How long do I have left? "Lax Scaffolding" isn't Milo Lax anymore, it's Asher Lax. Understand? Now let's finish the job early so you have time to study. Yeah, I have a matric exam tomorrow. Around noontime. I know the material more or less. Yeah, I'm good, I just wanted to hear how you're doing. Yeah. Okay, Mom, talk later, bye. "Polynices, whose one idea was to spill the blood of his blood "and sell his own people into slavery - Polyneices, I say, is to have no burial. "No man is to touch him or say the least prayer for him." Good morning, Asher. - Good morning. Did you go over the form? - I did. Good. Shall we begin? First question? -Yes. "Describe how the end of the piece contributes to the meaning of the piece." I chose "The Lament" by Chekhov. Excellent choice. At the end, lona the sledge-driver sits by his donkey and tells him what he never told anyone. He says: "You don't know how it hurts to bury your own child, "how hard it is." He says: "Imagine your son dies and you have to bury him." And you can tell that the donkey understands lona because of the tears in his eyes. And how does that contribute to the meaning of the piece? Chekhov describes it as if no one cared about lona, no one ever listened to him, and what did he need? For someone to listen to him for a minute, to be heard, but no one was there for him but the donkey. Okay. - Okay what? Fine. What? I answered everything. Look, there were some inaccuracies. It's not a donkey, it's a horse, and you didn't refer to the eye motif or the alienation. So change it to horse, big deal. Let's move on. Change it, what's the problem? This is an exam. Horse, donkey, same difference. Not really. How much did I get? How many points? Don't you think you're going too far? 14 points? I wanna know if I should continue. If you don't stop this, I'll... What did I do? It's my exam, not yours. Would you like some water to calm down? If you wrote "donkey" in a written exam I can assure you, you'd lose points. Donkey, horse, what's the difference? There's a big difference, it shows that you didn't read the piece and this is a matriculation exam in literature. Of course we read it. If the tester sees that you didn't read the piece that's that. But we read it in class, he read it to us. We don't read on our own. Oh. I see. I don't want you to test me, I want another tester. I'm your tester. There is no one else. Understand? Whether you like it or not. The Education Ministry appointed me as your tester so you have no choice. - You're a bitch, not a horse or a donkey. Rami was 10 times better than you. Fuck this. How much did I get? You failed. But you have to include my prelim score. I don't care about that. You failed. Stupid teacher who can't teach. Your behavior didn't help you either. I want someone else to test me. Rami was a way better teacher. What's going on? She said I failed, she doesn't care about my prelim. You got 55 on your prelim and 40 on your exam. Sadly, that's not enough. You gave me 55? After teaching me for two weeks? Rami should be grading me. I went to all his classes, I handed in my papers to him. Calm down, okay? I gave Rami a paper last month and I got a good grade. Really? - Yes. Do you have that paper? I have to look for it. How was the exam? - Awesome. Went real good, man. You gonna keep the beard? The beard's killer, bro. The exam was easy, huh? It was a joke. There's Rami's wife. Let's go talk to her. You coming, Asher? In a minute. Rami's wife. - Hello. We just had our exam. It was easy. It was? - Yeah, it went well. You knew everything? - Almost. I think I passed. Great. How did it go? - Okay. Great, you did it. Good job. It meant a lot to him. It's all thanks to Rami. He loved teaching you. What Rami did was wrong. He should've first helped us with the exam and then jump. What good is everything he taught us? Shut up, I'm talking to her. What good is it? If he didn't have the guts... Hands off! Asher, that's enough! I'm talking to her! He didn't have the guts to live! He wasn't real with us or with you! Why did Rami write, "I can't find any rest in the world..." Where did you read that? Where did you read that? Where did you read that? Why didn't you help him? Why didn't you help him? Asher. Asher. Good morning, sweetheart. Good morning. Your mother told me what happened. I got a call from the school. They want us to come in... They want to talk to us. About an apartment you went into. If there's a cop, I'll talk to him, okay? And if they want to take you in, don't make any problems. Let's go. We'll grab something to eat first. Dad, how is it you're so strong in my life? Why did you and Mom have me and then split up? Why didn't you ever read me stories? How can beating and loving go together?
