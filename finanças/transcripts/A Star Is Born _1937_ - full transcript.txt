[ musical medley of 'California Here I Come' ] [ howling ] Well, home from the movies at last. Looks like it, Aunt Mattle. - Heh. Hi, Dad! - Hello, Son! Well, daughter, how was the moving picture tonight? Hmm. Lovely! Mush, that's what it was. Just a lot of mush. There wasn't anybody killed in the whole thing. No, well then, I'll stick to these, these don't talk. Well, that big cluck, Norman Maine was in the picture tonight, he never does anything but kiss a lot of girls. Norman Maine, is one of the best actors in pictures. You and your movies. That's all that you think about. You shouldn't be allowed to go to 'em at all, if you're askin' me. Too bad I was so busy in the kitchen. I didn't hear anybody asking you. Hello, Granny! - Hello, Darling But of course, no one ever listens to me! They do if they're within ten miles of ya. Gathered around picture shows, house all cluttered-up with movie magazines. And the other day I caught her talking to a horse with a Swedish accent! Well, Sis, you're only young once, you know? Ah! Hollywood! You'd better be getting yourself a good husband and stop mooning about Hollywood. Do you know what she wants to do? She wants to go to Hollywood! I've known it all along. I've seen her making faces in the mirror and talking to herself. That's what comes of your movies! Why, what would you do if you did go to Hollywood? I'd be an actress. [ Mattie laughs ] I would, I tell ya, I've always known I could. Guys, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a movie star in the family? Oh, Miss Blodgett, may I have your autograph? You may not know it Aleck, but you're practically on your way to bed. Oh, Miss Blodgett, you're my favorite actress, won't you tell me the secret of your success? Oh, let me alone! Why Esther, what's come over you? I'll tell you what's come over her. She's just a silly little girl whose head has been turned by the movies. And the sooner she forgets the whole thing, the better-off she'll be. Oh, why will I be better off? What's wrong with wanting to get out and make something of myself? What do you do that's so much better? Just because you're satisfied to sit here all your life, you think you can laugh at me! Well, some day you won't laugh at me! I'm going out and have a real life! I'm gonna be somebody! [ door bangs ] Now if it was spring, I'd say give her a good dose of sulfur and molasses. Hm, I thought I'd find you up. Aw, stop that! Now stop crying! That isn't going to do you a bit good. Oh, I'm crying because Aunt Mattie and Aleck make me so mad. Well, it's your aunt Mattie, fiddlesticks. They're not important. You're the only one that counts. Esther, everyone in this world who has ever dreamed about better things has been laughed at. Don't you know that? Oh, I suppose I do, but— But there's a difference between dreaming and doing. The dreamers just sit around and moon about how wonderful it would be if only things were different. And the years roll on and they grow old and by-and-by they forget everything, even about their dreams. I don't want to be like that, I want to be somebody. Oh yeah, oh yeah. You want to be somebody, but you want it to be easy. Oh, you modern girls give me a pain! When I wanted something better, I came across those plains in a prairie schooner with your grandfather. Oh, everyone laughed at us, as they did at all the other pioneers. They said this country would never be anything but a wilderness. We didn't believe that. We were going to make a new country. Besides, we wanted to see our dreams come true. Oh Granny, it must have been wonderful. It was wonderful. But don't you think for one single minute that it was easy, Esther Blodgett. We burned in summer and we froze in winter. But we kept right on going and we didn't complain. Because we were doing what we wanted to do! Can you understand that? Yes, I can. Could you do it? Could you do it even if it broke your heart? Because remember Esther, for every dream of yours you make come true, you'll pay the price in heartbreak. Mm, I know what I'm talking about. You may not believe it, but I was a young girl once. A very pretty young girl, a lot prettier than you are. I was in love with your grandfather, and when some Injun devil put a bullet through him, I felt as if it had come right straight through my heart too. And I remembered all he taught me, and I went right on. I buried him out there on that wilderness with my own hands. And I went right on that same day and I kept right on the way, even when your mother was born. Oh Granny, I would make it worthwhile. Oh! [ Granny chuckles ] You know, Esther, there'll always be a wilderness to conquer. Maybe Hollywood's your wilderness now. From all I hear, it... it sounds like it. But if you've got one drop of my blood in your veins, you won't let Mattie or any of her kind break your heart. You'll go right out there and break it yourself. That's your right. Here. Oh, here, here, stop that nonsense. Here. Take this and go to your Hollywood. Oh, I can't take your money. - Well, why not? - It's your savings! Well, I was only saving-up for my funeral. Now I don't think I'm ever going to die. Oh, Granny, how can I ever thank you? By giving me your word of honor that you'll never tell a living soul where you got that money. - I promise. - Remember, if you do, I'll have you arrested for robbing me. [ door shuts ] [ train whistle blows ] Whoa! Here we are. You want me to help you, Granny? Oh, I can make it, Dear. Oh! Uh, oh man, it's cold, whooh! I kissed Dad goodbye, just a little kiss. He didn't even wake up. I bet you didn't try that on your Aunt Mattie. Oh, Aunt Mattie... ...think of her face when you tell her. I am thinking about it. I've waited for that chance for thirty years. There she is, girls. Oh, thank you Kirby. Girls, huh? [ train bells ] Well, come on, come on! There it is, your prairie schooner. [ train bells continue ] [ Conductor ]: All aboard! Oh, Granny! [ Auld Lang Syne playing ] Go on, go on! Go on! Go on! - Goodbye Granny! - Goodbye! I'll be waiting for you in those moving pictures. And don't tell Mattie! You know my eyes are not as good as they used to be, but my ears are all right. So you remember, talk up good and loud. [ Conductor ]: All aboard! [ train whistle blows ] - Goodbye! - Bye! I love you. Goodbye Granny! Goodbye. So, you wanna go home now? I don't want to, but I will. ♪ [ "California Here I Come" playing ] Ahem. [ buzzer] Good afternoon. Day, week or month? Well, it's a little hard to say, you see, I'm going into the movies. Well you better take it for a week, it'll break your jump to Beverly Hills. Are all the studios really near here? All except Gaumont British. I suppose the best way to get a job is to go straight to the studios. Isn't it? - Hm-hm. I haven't any illusions you know, I am perfectly willing to begin with... ooh, a little bit of a part, or even as an extra. Six dollars, please, in advance. Oh. I beg your pardon, I'd like to register for extra work. How long have you been in Hollywood? Well, it's about a month now. We haven't put anyone on our books for over two years. Come here, I'd like to show you something. - Central Casting. - Try later. - No can't be, try later. - Try later. - Try later, thank you. - Try later. - Not now, try later. - Central Casting. Every time you see one of those little lights flash, it's somebody asking for a job. Every time you hear them say: "Try later", it means there isn't any job. Can't keep the girls at the switchboard long, they'd go crazy. [ door closes ] Every one of those little lights thought it was going to be a star. Still wanna go into movies? You know what your chances are? One in a hundred thousand. But, maybe... ...I'm that one. Any phone calls for me, Mr. Randall? oh... no. Jesse Lasky and Sammy Goldwyn must be writting letters instead. How was the luck today? - Mm, there wasn't any. Maybe you don't go at in the right way Now take Danny McGuire here, he knows the ropes, ah, don't you Danny? Sure, I've had 'em around my neck for years. [ buzzer] Hmm... What? Oh--oh, ah, Miss Blodgett, Danny McGuire. -- Our new tenant. How do you do? Mr. McGuire is a... ...big director. Oh. Are you really? Oh, could you possibly use me in a picture, Mr. McGuire? Of course I haven't had much experience, but I don't think that really matters if you're willing. - And I'm— - Now listen, lady, In the first place I'm not a director, I'm an assistant director and in the second place, if I had any jobs to give away, I'd confer one on myself. And in the third place, you should have stayed back home in the first place! Aw, now look what you've done. Hey, wait a minute! Hey, don't be that way! Don't do that. Gosh, I didn't mean to get tough, but... a guy thinks he's being kidded when somebody asking for a job and, he hasn't got one for himself. After all, I'm not a big enough shot to hurt your feelings. I--I--I'm sorry. It wasn't just that, oh, it was a lot of things. I've been looking for a job everyday and never getting any nearer to it. I guess I was beginning to get a little scared. I know. Lady, do I know. Well, there's only one thing to do with that feeling when you're tired and sunk and down to your last nickle. Come on and I'll buy you a drink. Well its not as bad as down to the last nickle I've still got eleven dollars left. Eleven dollars! You're gonna buy me a drink! Come on! That's right George, there's nothing like a little rum to take away that milk flavor. [ Esther laughs ] Oh, I beg your pardon. Certainly. [Esther chuckles ] ...and when I sign my contract, the first thing I'm gonna do is see that you direct every picture that I'm in. Thats my pal! Of course I'm going to be perfectly nice about it, but, I'll just insist. Now that's the way to talk. Don't let 'em lick ya. - No, I should say they can't lick me, if they try anything like that well, I— I just won't sign. Now that's right. What have you got to lose? Another one of these and we'll open our own studio! Bill rendered, twenty-four dollars. Past due. remit without further delay. Me. Whh! Poor kid. If she can't pay that bill she gets mmm, tough luck is it? No! Hhh! There, on the fifth race... on the fifth race, I can't... I can't believe it... I can't. [ crowd chattering ] [ orchestra tuning ] Hey! The program's gonna be swell tonight. Now you take this fella Beethoven: I'm a pushover for him. And Chopin... well, he's not so dusty, either. But I kinda wish that once in awhile they'd play something you could sorta go out whistlin'. You know, like, ♪ Blood on the saddle, blood on— ♪ Well now, there's a tune. Hey, why don't you throw your hat in the air or something. Can't you? This is a celebration, my job starts tomorrow. I know it does, and I think it's swell, Danny. Gee, I wish you were in on it too. But oh no, it would have to be a war picture. One of those big novelty numbers... a war picture without any beautiful women at the front. Oh well, something'll happen soon. Maybe. Why don't you go home kid? Oh Danny, I can't do that. I came here and I've got to stay. Well now, if it's on account of money I can— Thank you but you given enough already. Anyhow this is no time to be worrying, this is a party! [ Danny laughs ] Look at all the people. Everybody in the world. Look! That's Norman Maine. [ chattering ] Alright, and he seems to have had that one extra cocktail. [ applause ] [ cheers ] Oh, Thank you. Sit down you dope, that's for the orchestra leader. [ Danny laughs ] [ music begins ] Oh, hello... - Hello, Norman. Oh, Mr. Maine, Mr. Maine, put your arm around Miss Regis. Arlow, this is the Hollywood Bowl. Oh, afraid of crowds? Go on, go on, get out of here. What's the matter? You gettin too big to bother with photographers? Don't want any pictures taken now. Oh is that so? Well supposin' I take it anyway? Well, I'll shove that Brownie Number 2 of yours down your throat! Thank you, Mr. Maine! Norman! Stop it! Stop! Norman! No! Oh no, Stop! Stop it! Come on! Take it easy, Mr. Maine! - Hey, take your hands off. Calm down, please. Normie, come back and sit down everybody's laughing at you. Alright, already— Hi, Norman. Is he always like that? Well, I suppose he has to sleep sometime. Oh, and he's so wonderful on the screen. Shhh! [ music playing ] [ knocking on door ] Come in. Hello, Danny. What's the matter? Well, believe it or not... I've got a job for you. Hhh! Danny, that's wonderful! When do I go to the studio? Well, you don't exactly go to the studio. Oh! It's on location. No, it's not exactly on location either. Of course I haven't any makeup. Will you tell me what to get and sort of help me put it on? Well, you don't exactly need any makeup, you see it's not really a picture job, it's--it's well, it's being a waitress. Oh. Well it's kind of a picture job if you look at it right. But you said it was a waitress. Well, it's waitressing for Casey Burt. the big director over at our studio, he's giving a party tonight to kind of celebrate on account of finishing the picture. And... and he wanted me to get him an extra waitress and it's five dollars. And I thought of you right away, Esther. That was awfully sweet of you Danny. Well, well, there's gonna be a lot of big people at Burke's house tonight, and I'll bet you there's any number of big directors, and if you're there maybe they'll notice ya. I could make them notice me. Sure you could Esther! It's your chance! My chance. Alright Danny, I'll do it. Oh... oh, but I can't, I haven't got the right things to wear. To wear? To wear? Oh! Oh! Yes! Well, you don't think the wardrobe department's right next to my office for nothing, do ya? Ha-ha! A perfect fit! Did you get to the preview last night? I did. (Garboesque) Vould you like a little hors d'oeuvre? They are very nice. Well thanks. Well what did you think of the picture? You should have saved it for Thanksgiving. What a turkey! - Ohh..! [ chuckles ] ( Davisesque ) Will you have some hors d'oeuvres? You do like hors d'oeuvres don't you? I don't think there's anything so enjoyable as hors d'oeuvres before supper And these are really delightful. [Man ] ...and at the finish, the kid turns around and sings a lullaby to its mother. (Westesque) Ah, pardon me, big boy, but, would you like a little, hors d'oeuvres? They say they're the best... in town. Don't tell me. I know. Mae West. That's a great twist! But where are you gonna find a two month old baby that can sing? - Hello, Oliver! - Oh, hello Casey. Do you wanna fire me now, or wait till you see the picture? I'm not a director anymore I'm a... male nurse! What's the matter with the picture? A guy by the name of Norman Maine. His work is beginning to interfere with his drinking. Oliver, don't tell me I'm to direct his next picture, too. Mhm-hmh. You were my favorite producer. Now wait a minute, you just go right on with your directing. I'll take care of these stars. I know how to handle them. I had a serious talk with Norman after that ah, Hollywood Bowl occurrence. And you don't have to worry any more about his behavior. Excuse me, Mister Niles. Mr Libby, of your publicity department is on the telephone. He says it's most important Sir. It's about Mr. Maine. - Thank you. Oh, it's probably just some little thing. Hm-mh. Of course, Oliver! I´ll turn on the radio and see if he's called out the National Guard yet. Hello Libby, what´s the good word? Mister Norman Maine, America's Prince Charming, was apprehended driving an ambulance down Wilshire Boulevard! With a siren going full blast. He explained he was a tree surgeon on a maternity case. Well... ah, ah, will it be in the papers? No it won't be in the papers. But that's a nice expensive hobby of yours. Keeping Mr. Maine's informal entertainments out of the public press. Oh, that´s fine work Libby. Ah, try and see that no one gets to Norman. He's probably home sleeping it off. - Oliver. Why can't you forget those dopes at the studio for one night? Business, business all the time. I dont know what´s gonna become of you. Norman! Why didn't you call for me? Oh my darling, why didn't I call for you? In case you've forgotten, I was supposed to come here with you. Oh that... oh that's all right, I got here without any trouble. The only reason I don't slap your face— Yes, yes, darling. I- I know. Hello John! - Oh. Hello, old man! What's the matter with Oliver? He looks as if he got bad news. Hello! Hello Larry. What's the matter, old boy? Maybe I'm wrong. I guess I've been drinking too much lately. Oh, you ought to cut that down, it's bad stuff. Scotch and soda. Ahhh! Come on, come on, come on. The word, you know, is pronounced 'when'. Bad dialog, Oliver. I would rather not watch this. You know best. Soda! Thank you! Ooo. Go ahead and say it. I've got it coming to me. Don't make it tougher on me Norman. I don't want to stand here and preach. But take a look at my side of it, I'm trying to make pictures with you. I know, I know. Costs are going up and the grosses are going down. No, it isn't that. I've made lots of money with you, and I can afford to take a loss, but I hate to see you going the way of so many others. Why don't you get Lloyds to insure you against me? You can't get insurance against a man forgetting who he is. You're a great star Norman, but there's nobody so big they can afford to have people refuse to work with him. Who doesn't wanna work with me? You— Shh! Quiet. Listen, I know plenty people who do. Yes and so do I, but your real friends can't stand to see you start to fall apart. What do you mean by that? The first signs are always the same: not being able to remember your lines, camera man struggling to cover your hangovers, and all because you have to have a good time... ...every day and every night. Listen, I've warned you for a long time— Okay, Oliver, you're a swell guy, you won't lose any money on me. I'll promise you that. I'll be ready for the curtains when the time comes. When it does, Here's my epitaph. Now I think I'll um... [ knocks on counter twice ] have a little drink. Scotch and soda Scotch and Soda. Oh. Ah... Come on, come on, come on, come on. And a little soda. - Caviar? - No, thanks. Yes, ah, um, pardon me. Hi... lovely, lovely. Ah, ah, I mean the caviar. Oh no, don't--don't go away, I'm starving, ah... really, hmm. Which... which would you take? Oh, I don't know. You don't know? I... I don 't know either. It's hard to choose. But I think I'll take, caviar. Mr. Maine doesn't care for any more. Do you, Normie? No. No, Normie doesn't care for any more. I think I shall get very drunk indeed. Scotch and sod— [ Norman chuckles ] Sorry, I have something. - Oh. - Do you mind if I help? Won't they miss you? Oh no, no, they'll just look under the table and when they see I'm not there, they'll forget the whole matter. [ Norman chuckles] Eh, what... eh... what... what's your name? Esther Blodgett. My name is Maine. - I know. - You do? Huh. What, what's so funny? I was just thinking about all your fans and how surprised they'd be to see you here helping me put plates away. Oh they--they don't know my finer side. [ Esther chuckles ] They'd be pretty envious of me, meeting you this way in person. Oh, how'd you do? So tell me are, are... are-are you disappointed? Yes. [ plate breaks ] Oh. Now you've done it. Oh never mind that, that makes the room look lived in. Tell me um, why... why--why are you disappointed? I was sitting behind you at the Hollywood Bowl, the night you didn't want to be photographed. [ plate breaks ] Oh. I'm told I crept in to many a heart that night. Oh, I can never explain this. You know you have very pretty hair. You better get out of here. and a sensitive mouth... and a charming little— Precisely why are you're here instead of with the rest of the guests? Well, I was just trying to be helpful and— I see. Are you sure there's no other attraction? Well it might be that my old mania for putting plates away is coming back on me. It's rather odd. I always know where I can find you, if there's a... pretty girl around. It's not only odd, it's embarrassing. You're being deliberately insulting Norman. I've put up with you for long enough— Now, now, now dear, don't lose your temper. Remember, we must try to keep the voice low. I know you'll excuse us if we go on with our work. [ platter shatters ] [ Norman thuds on floor ] Now see what you've done! Whst. Whst, whst... come here! Help me up. Are you hurt? N... n-no more than usual. Come on! The wolves are on us, we gotta get outta here. Well, I can't! The dishes aren't finished! Oh yes they are! [ dishes shatter ] [ brakes squeak ] Well, I bet I know what you're gonna say now. What? Good night. Good night and thanks. Hey wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey, uh... do you realize that... all I found out about you is that you're ah, foolish enough to want to go into pictures? Why the foolish? Look at you. Yeah, that's what I mean. No I'd, ah... I'd rather like to go into this matter, a little more thoroughly. Well, that's awfully nice of you. Why um... why don't we uh, go on up to my place and ah, talk it over? Oh, no. Thank you very much, but... I really must say good night. Good night. Oh, but you're not angry? No no no. I'm hungry. Well, why don't you go and get something to eat? Goodnight, Miss Blodgett. Goodnight, Mr. Maine. Wait a minute! Come here, the least I can do is to see you to your door. Will I see you again? I hope so. Has anyone ever told you that you're lovely? Well, now you know. Thank you. It's a... it's hard to say, but I... I wanna say it anyway. You know, I'm a-- I'm a screen-- I'm a-- you know... in private life, I'm a, well, you know.... Look, whatever I do, I... I still respect lovely things. And you are lovely. Do you understand? Yes, I-I think I do. And it isn't that bump on the head that's doing this. [ Esther chuckles ] Well, I'm glad. Good night. - Good night. Hey! Do you mind if I take just one more look? [ telephone rings ] Go away! Quite impossible. I wouldn't even consider it! Oh no, no! [ telephone continues to ring ] Hello? Who is it? Who? Norman?! What have you done now? You're not in jail are you? Ohhh..! Yes, I see. Oh it's that again. I see. She's beautiful. Yeah. I know, you want me to give her a screen test. Yeah, certainly, she's got wonderful possibilities. Oh, you know she's got something... and you knew all the other ones had something too. Oh no! I tell you Oliver, she's got that sincerity... and-and honestness, and uh, uh, uh, sin-sincerity and honestness, that uh, that makes great actresses. You c— Oliver, I am so sure of this girl, that I want to take the test with her myself. Hmm... Listen Oliver, you've worked hard, you're entitled to a break. You get— [ short whistles ] Yes. I heard you. Anything. ANYTHING! Yes! Yes. - Yeah. Oliver, look... you--you try to get a little sleep now old man, you— Right. Alright boy. Good--good night. [ Norman laughs ] [ mumbles]: I need coffee. [ mumbles]: Bathroom. [ mumbles]: There they are... [ mumbles]: What do I do today... [ mumbles]: Telephone book Telephone book. Wsht!

You see, all the experts seem to think that your type is a little mild for present day taste. But I'd rather believe that tastes change, like eyebrows. And I think that also like eyebrows, tastes are going back to the natural. You look like a nice girl. I think I'm going to like you. That's not important. I think the public will like you. That is important. [ sighs ] Yes. I see what you mean... I--I mean I know it is. But you don't think it's going to be easy Nothing you really want is ever given away free. You have to pay for it. And usually with your heart. Someone else told me that once. But you still have to work it out for yourself. Oh well, all this is just a long way of saying: I'm glad you're with us, and good luck to you. And now, I'm going to turn you over to our demon press agent, Libby. Don't let him frighten you.

Oh no. Grace saw light of day in a mountain cabin, a trappers hut high up in the rockies. Go on. Well I, I always wanted to be an actress. Dreamed of footlights, as lonely kitty. Are you sure theres no Russian in your family? - Positive. - That's a shame. Well, what does your father do? - He's a farmer. - Nah... Social register-ied father, fed up with hypocrisies, a '400', sought wilderness for consolation. There amidst the mountain flowers, he raised another blossom. His lovely little daughter... What's your name? Esther Victoria Blodgett. Greatly appreciating your attention in this matter, very truely... Do you know what her name is? Esther Victoria Blodgett. Hey, we'll have to do something about that, right away. Esther Victoria Blodgett. Well, that Blodgett's definitely out. Let's see, ah, Esther Victoria, Victoria, Vicki. How about Vicki?

Vicki Lester. Flash! Oliver Niles' Studio discovers new starlet. A Cinderella of the Rockies. Her name is Vicki Lester. Those who have peeked tell me should couldn't be more divine. The face of an angel and such natural talents. Her voice is a symphony. Her very walk, they tell me, is enough... to drive men mad! Not that way! Get the lead outta your feet! Lift 'em up! That's better. It's terrible, but it's better. The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven. Cease! Through the mouth, my child, through the mouth. The nose is for smelling roses. [ he chuckles ] Proceed. Does she have to look surprised all the time? Anyway, it's just a rough sketch. Pretty small mouth, eh? [ tsks ] Oh well, mmh...

Mister Smith is not in. Good morning, what can I bring you Mr. Maine? That just shows how long you've been here. Mabel, bless you. How soon are you and I gonna be married, huh? I don't know. You'll have to ask my mother. Ahcme trrucking company. Ah, no, Mister Smythe is not in. Acme trr-ucking company. No, Mister er, Smith is not in. Acme. Naw, Smith ain't in! [ pop ] Blaah! Acme trucking company. - I'd like to speak to Mr. Smith please. - Mister Smith is not— Oh, Norman! What's all this between you and Smith? I got a part. It's only one line... but it's in the picture! So it's ambition that made you break that date with me last night. Well, I had to be here so early this morning— And, uh, so did I. I had to stay up all night to make it. You've started your picture, haven't you? No, no we are still in the testing stage. We can't seem to get the right girl for the lead. Hmm... You'd think with all the girls there are that— Yeah, well, this one's got to be different. She's got to be little, and cute, and sweet, a-- and intelligent. Well blow me down. - What? - Well close my tired old eyes. - Wha--what is it? - Hold everything, come on! Come on! I heard you've been through the whole casting directory— - I'll work day and night Mr. Niles. - And I'll work with her Oliver! And I can be mean or nasty or anything you want, Mr Niles. If she clicks Oliver, you've got a star overnight. Okay. [ trumpet fanfare ] [ fanfare continues ] [ applause ] [ clapping ] Wait till you hear them at the end of the picture. Do you think we were noticed? By no one... They're much to busy playing at croquet. I've loved you all my life. But, we only met two days ago. That's when my life began. Ain't she cute? You know I think she's the same type I am. Don't you? I think she's sweet. Well, it's Vicki Lester's picture alright. I think she was much better than he was. These producers are so horribly dumb, They won't know how good she is. Well maybe it's because she's a good girl. All I mean is that it's not so bad, but it's Vicki Lester they'll go to see. That Vicki, darling, I think she's the most precious little thing I've ever seen. Mm-hmm! She's a knock out Libby. You might mention that when you write your review. That Lester kid's a gold mine. Didn't you like Norman Maine? Was he in it? [ chuckles ] Libby? I'm afraid we have another hit. It's in the bag. Neatly tied up with beautiful pink ribbons. Hey, where are Norman and Vicki? I don't know, I thought you had them. I wish they'd come, were having a party at the Trocadero. Isn't it thrilling running away from people? Norman, it's so exciting! So— So new. A star is born. Come on, run! It's wonderful, isn't it? A crazy quilt. Well... it's a carpet spread for you. It's all yours from now on, you know. Come Esther, you're a success. You can have everything in the world you want. I hope it'll make you happy. Hasn't it you? But then there was one thing I never had. Lots of times I... told myself I'd found it, but I always knew I was lying. Still I... I never stopped looking for it. Maybe it'll come. Well, I think it has come, Esther. I only wish it weren't too late. Oh, but it's not too late. Oh, you can't throw away your life the way I've thrown away mine... ...and have anything left that's good enough... no. You can. Norman... you can. You mustn't tell me that, Esther. I'm so afraid that I'll believe it. [ cheering, crowd noises ] Come on Garcia, shoot your right! Swell, isn't it? - Lovely. Watch Garcia again. Can't you hear me Garcia? Shoot your right! He's down! Garcia got him! Garcia's got him! He did, didn't he? Yeah, but he'll be up, though. You like it? - Yeah, I do. - You like me? - Sure I do. Oo... that reminds me. Will you marry me? No thank you. - You wh— Come on Garcia, finish him! Why won't you marry me? Because you're not dependable Hey, shoot your right! - You throw away your money. - Break him off in there, break him up! and you drink so much. - Well, suppose I quit drinking? - Yes. Come on, Garcia, shoot your right in there, the right!! Suppose I save my money? - Yes. There he goes! ...Let him have it!! Suppose I became absolutely dependable on all occasions? Yes. Yay, yeah! Yay, Garcia! He got him! He got him! He certainly did. Gee, that was a beautiful fight! - Norman? - What dear? Would you do all that for me if I said I'd marry you? Well, certainly not! I was just supposing. We're going to be married. Guess I didn't read that line right. I'll try it again. We are going to be married. - Both of us. - To each other. What do you think of that? Well when? Where? Well, we ah, thought that we'd elope, in the conventional manner. What's the matter? He's trying to decide whether it's good for the studio. - Is it? - It is. And bless you my children. When's it going to happen? Oh we thought we'd just sneak out some time. W're not telling anyone but you. Listen to this! The screen's ideal romance blossomed into breathing reality today when Vicki Lester and Norman Maine, America's dream lovers, slipped quietly thru the portals of holy matrimony. How does it sound? - Horrible. - But you see we're going to elope. Sure you are! It will be the biggest elopement this town ever saw. We'll get a tie-up with the army and have you escorted all the way down to Yuma, by twenty of their new bombing planes. Is he going with us? Don't you think we can work this thing out better alone? No sense in bothering the happy couple with all the details. I'll see to it that you get a carbon copy of the whole layout. I can hardly wait. I'm ah, sorry we didn't realize that we were in the way. While you're settling the details, you don't mind if I take this woman out and buy her a ring, do you? Sure, go ahead, we want everything legal. [ door closes ] That's a charming match. A nice girl like Vicki and public nuisance number one. Now wait a minute Libby, Norman's all right. And if you'll pardon my pointing, Vickie's business is her own. It doesn't require any comments. I wasn't making any comments. I just said it's a rotten shame. So go ahead and plan the elopement. Oh that elopement stuff is out. You can't get any scope in that. We are going to have a wedding. Where will we have it? The customary place I believe, is a church. Nah. It's been done. This gotta be something big. The beach. I can visualize it. The bridesmaids in bathing suits. Twenty thousand Santa Monica school children, spelling out the word love. It's a novelty, but is it big enough? Why not the City Hall? A police escort, and every motorcycle cop in town, sirens screaming, confetti pouring out of buildings, like the Lindbergh reception in New York, only on a big scale. What's the matter... isn't it big enough? And now if any man can show just cause why these two may not be lawfully joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter, forever hold his peace. Do you Alfred Hinkel, take this woman as your lawful wedded wife? Will you love, comfort, honor and keep her in sickness and health, as long as you both shall live? - I will. Do you, I beg your pardon. Do you, eh, Esther Blodget take this man as you your lawful wedded husband? Will you obey, serve, love, honor and keep him in sickness and health, as long as you both shall live? I will. Place the ring on her finger - Uh-huh. and hurry please. - Uh-huh. Now by virtues of the power invested in me as Justice of the Peace of San Bardo Township, County of Los Angeles, I pronounce you man and wife. [ applause ] Quiet! And now I must exercise my prerogative of office. [ chuckles ] I hope you'll be very happy Mrs. Hinkel. Thank you. - Thank you, sir, thank you very much. - Oh, Danny... Now if you'll please sign the license. Oh, oh yeah. You know ahh, Mrs. Hinkel, I can't help but believe, I've seen you somewhere before. Oh really? Well, uh, I believe this is the first time I've ever been in San Bardo. You know your face is familiar too. - Really? - Here you are, sir. - Thank you very much. - Here's your receipt. -Thank you. - Good-goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye! - Nice to see you again. - Yes, goodbye. No I got something I'll just see to here. Ah— - Yeah, I think we got by with it. - But it was close, that J.P. was just beginning to remember where he'd seen us. But anyway, we got away from Libby. Hello, gents! If you will be kind enough to glance between my shoulder blades, Mr. and Mrs. Hinkel, you will find there a knife, buried to the hilt. On the handle are your initials. I'd rather not see you Libby! Hold him, hold him Danny! There go a couple of rats I raised from mice. Well, they've got a right to get married haven't they? They haven't got any right to double-cross the public. And I haven't done it yet! Hey! The people versus Porky Washington, who is charged with violating section 600— Young man, you're in contempt of court! Operator? Get me the Los Angeles Tribune. I have a good mind to put you under arrest! Wait 'till I make this call. You wait too. Tribune? Give me the city desk. Johnny? This is Matt Libby. I got a flash for ya. Norman Maine and Vicki Lester were married at 2:30 this afternoon. Vicki Lester?! Court recessed! [ mayhem ] [ whistling ] ♪ So give me a horse, a great big horse ♪ ♪ A great big buckeroo and ♪ ♪ Let me wahoo, wahoo, wahoo! ♪ Wahoo! [ gears grind ] Wahoo. Hey wahoo... I don't ah, want to sound immodest, but I think I've stripped a gear. Well sit down won't you and let's get acquainted. We'll probably be seeing quite a bit of each other from now on. Hm-hm. We might just as well break the ice now as later Hnh. Now we're old friends. [ Esther chuckles ] Say, have I... have I got time for a shower before dinner? Plenty, if you can find the shower. I never can remember where that thing is, does it, ah, pull out or slide under? Here, I think I can find it. Nope, that's the linen closet. Here it is. Nice work. Oh, half-the-time those things are just luck. I'll see if I can disinfect this steak. Hey Esther. Uh, there's no soap. Here. Thank you. Oh and Esther... - Yes, Dear? I'll--I'll need a washcloth, please. How are you fixed for cigarettes? You know I never smoke underwater. Ah, what, what do I do to make this thing work? Pull that gadget at the top and pray for rain. Well, I... I can't reach it, I can-can't get my hands up! If you've gone in there with your arms down, you'll never get your bath, unless you're a contortionist. Yeah well, I-I'm not a contortionist... and don't throw that up to me now. You-you knew it when you married me. Can you close this door please? Thank you! Ooo... oh! Ow! [ car horn honks ] Norman! Norman, here comes a car. You gotta— Huh? - Here, quick! Quick what? - Quick go out and stop them and ask for help. Oh, I'll-I'll catch cold! Oh, you'll get warm again. Yeah... oh shoot, they'll recognize me! Not if you keep your face down! Go on, there may not be another car for weeks! Alright. [ whistles ] - Er... ah... - Howdy partner! - Howdy... ah... - Stuck? Yeah, how'd you guess it? Ah, can you get us some help? Well, I reckon not. You know, it's a long way to town, and we're pretty busy down at the place. Well, I got to get out of here, I-I've got my wife with me and— - Doesn't she like the country? - No. No, and we're short of food. Well, there's a lot of game in them woods. Yeah, well my wife can't shoot. Well you're sure up against it. Sorry I can't do anything for ya. Now wait, listen, I'll be frank with ya. I'm Norman Maine. Who? Norman Maine! Well, my name is Judd Baker Glad to have met ya. Well, so long. Hey wait a... wait a minute. Listen... you don't— So you're Norman Maine. I got my prestige to look out for. I'm supposed to be the best publicity man in the racket. And they laugh themselves sick when I even try to get a decent mention of Maine. Yes, I know how sensitive you are Libby and I don't like to see your feelings hurt. Thanks boss. Now Vicki, there's a dish for free space, but if Maine swam across the Pacific the papers would keep it a secret. Well... the exhibitors don't like him, the critics don't like him, the public don't like him, and I don't like him. Who likes him? Oh but darling, this is almost too much of a surprize. And there I was in my touching innocence, thinking we were going to live in the beach house. Oh, we'll still keep the place at Malibu. But this is special, this is our castle. It used to be in the air, you know. We will never use any ugly words like, contracts and pictures and careers. When we come in those gates, we'll check the studio outside. Come on, I've got another little surprise for you. [ swan whistles ] Oh Norman, it's lovely. So are you, lovely. The whole world's lovely. Hey! Hold it! That's it. Caption: Their honeymoon never ends. Alright, let's get some pictures. Now, if the bride will sit here and the groom will stand behind her, you'll have something unique. Now, lets go after something different You sit down and she'll stand up. - Pretty radical isn't it? - Yeah, but in a nice way. -Yeah. Okay Otto, fire! Caption: Their honeymoon begins anew. Ah, the producer. Caption: Their honeymoon ceases abruptly. Hello Oliver, glad to see ya! - Oh I'm glad your back. - Thank you. - Vicki, how well you're lookng. Hello Oliver. - Am I interrupting? - Yes, thank you. Just want a couple more pictures. That's enough of both of them. What they're asking for are exclusives of Miss Lester. Alone! Oh, I see. Well, come on Oliver, let's you and me get exclusive. See you later Vicki. Well, don't worry, Otto, my camera smashing days are over. Yeah... danger only days are over. Oh, hold that Miss Lester. [ camera clicks] Gorgeous! Oliver? How's the dividend situation? Very pleasant. I think we show two million on our next quarter. [ Norman laughs] Smart move of mine to sell my stock, eh? Oh well, when you need money, you need it. Some people save up for just such an event. There's bound to be a rainy day occasionally. Yeah, well as a citizen of California, I've always refused to admit that. Yes, I know, but still it does rain. Well anyway, you can thank me for some of those dividends of yours. Mmh-hmm. Well, can't you? - Well, sure, sure. That was a little too quick, Oliver. Well, The Enchanted Hour was a smash hit wasn't it? Well, it made Vicki a star overnight. Yes, it should have. How about me? Well, lets talk about business at the office, Norman. Beautiful pool you have here. Beautiful! Oh, no, lets talk about it here. Didn't they like me? Well, maybe the part wasn't just right. Well, it was the best part of the year. Look, Oliver... do you think I'm slipping? Can you take it? Yeah, go ahead. The tense is wrong. You're not slipping, you've slipped. Well, my... ...my fan mail is still big. Norman, Norman, fans will write to anybody for a photograph. It only costs 3 cents for a stamp, and that makes photographs cheaper than wallpaper. But every 25 cents they pay for a theater ticket, buys them the right to be a critic. And your last few performances, Norman, have not pleased your critics. You remember, I told you I'd uh... be ready for the curtains when the time came? Well, here it is. Let's call off the contract, no hard feelings. We're not quitting. Either of us. There is no explaining these things, we've all seen how the public turns. Maybe we can turn them back. I've got a swell script lined-up for you. About... about Esther? Uh... do you think that I'm going to get in her way? Well, as a matter of fact, as it happens, there's no part in the story for her. I'd more or less planned to star her in a picture of her own. With uh... that young Pemberton opposite her. He's coming along nicely. Good for young Pemberton. Alright Oliver... we'll make a try at it. Lets hope it's not... too late. No argument... I'll buy those. Ha! The screen's most finished actor [ chuckles ] I'll say he's finished. He keeps 'em away in droves. [ telephone rings ] Hello. No. No Miss Lester isn't home as yet. No, I'm not the butler. Well, I can take a message just as well as he can, honest. Oh, is that you Norman? Swell! Listen Norman, this is Artie Carver. How are you kid? Swell. Say, I hear you're through with Oliver Niles. Is that on the level? Ah, please Artie, I'm not news anymore. Forget it. Say, what kind of a settlement did you make on your contract? Give me a figure, so I can do a story on it. [ exhales ] There was no money involved. We just called it quits. Okay, Okay... I'll fill in my own figure. Say by the way... I've been trying to get an interview with Vicki for two weeks, but she's always busy. How about you giving an old pal a break by speaking to her for me? Sure I'll ask her. Swell. So long. [ chuckles] I didn't mean to be late darling, but Casey wanted me— It's all right. You're here now. What's new today? Nothing. I haven't been out of the house. Lets go somewhere tonight. Oh no. No, you're tired, we'll stay in. I'm not tired, really. Oh, yes you are. You've got a hard day ahead of you. Anyway, I see so little of you, I'd like to have you to myself. Oh, but it's the servants' night out, we haven't any dinner— Yes we have. I fixed a little snack with my own, lily white hands. I ah... ...I'm learning to cook in my spare time. - Then I think I'll marry you. Oh I get it, You want to make an honest cook of me, huh? Comes in on wheels in this joint. Here you are. How's it look? Hmm... wonderful! Aa, that's what I thought. Now there, don't be formal just pitch in. Here you are. I'm afraid my mouth's not quite big enough. I'll ah, I'll measure it next time and make them to size. A little hard to lift, too. In fact I think, I'll take those measurements right now. That's what I wait for... all day. That's why I rush home without even changing my costume. Wait... we're forgetting that we're hungry. Would you like a sandwich? Thank you, I still have a little work on this one. Now... Oh... [ chuckles ] - Ahh! - Norman will you unhook my dress, I can't breathe. - Hm-hmh. You know, all the time I thought it was the kiss that made you breathless. [ Esther laughs ] A lot of hooks. - Ah-hah. Why don't you have a zipper? That's a good idea. - Feel better? [ Esther exhales ] - Yes. Pfhhh! Don't look now, but uh... ...I think that guy on your left is in love with you. I hope so. [ door bell buzzes] [ door bell again ] [ door bell buzzes ] - It's the door bell. - Is it? Maybe they'll go away. Oh they never do at a time like this, you... well, you.... Just a minute dear. I'll be right back. Does Vicki Lester live here? - Yes. I've got a package for her. - I'll sign for it. - And who are you? - I'm her husband - Oh sure... Sign right here, Mr. Lester. [ door closes ] It's a package for you. And, by the way, I forgot to tell you, uh... they want you for a benefit at the Shrine Auditorium, next Wednesday night. I told them I'd ask you. and, ah - Oh, Darling, ah, I don't want to hear about that now. Well, you better wait till I finish before I forget them all. Uhm... the Academy Dinner secretary phoned she wants to know if you want a table reserved for you. Ah... Oh yes, Artie Carver called... and asked if I'd use my influence with you to get him an interview. I told him I'd try. Ah... that was all I think. Oh Norman, let's don't talk about those things now. We're forgetting the wonderful food you prepared. I'm--I'm not very hungry now... I think I'll ah... I'll fix me a little drink. Hmm? Oh, but Norman— [ applause ] I wish Norman would come. Oh, stop worrying. And think how nice that statue is going to look on your mantle piece. Do you suppose anything's happened to him? But of course not, he's just been held up in traffic. You think about that statuette. And now we arrive at the climax of the annual dinner of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The highest award within our power to bestow. We've already applauded with our hearts as well as our hands, while awards have been given those gentleman, who during the past year have rendered distinguished service to the motion picture industry. We now pay honor to the ladies. Or rather to one lady. We offer to her the Academy Award for the finest performance of the past year. She has already had the world's acclaim, but this is the tribute of her fellow workers, the men and women of this industry. It is not only my pleasure, but my privilege, to present this award to the actress who created the unforgettable Anna, in Dream without End. Miss Vicki Lester. [ applause ] [ applause and cheers ] [ applause and cheers continue ] What more can we say Miss Lester? This says it all for us. [ applause ] Ladies and gentlemen: When something like this happens to you and you try to tell how you feel about it, you find that out of all the words in the world, there are only two that really mean anything: Thank you! All I can do is to say them to you from my heart. All I can do is to keep on saying them. - Hey! That's fine! - Oh Mr. Maine, please! That's a very pretty speech my dear... - Just a moment! ...very pretty! You said the right thing. I wanna be the very first one to congratulate you on that, on that valuable little piece of bric-a-brac. Now, I wanna make a speech. Gentleman of the Academy and fellow suckers, I got one of those once for a best performance, they don't mean a thing... people get 'em every year. What I want is a special award. Something nobody else can get. I want a statue for the worst performance of the year. In fact, I want three statues. For the three worst performances of the year, because I've earned them. And every single one of you that saw those last masterpieces of mine knows that I've earned them. Libby, start the music. What I'm here to find out is: do I get 'em, or do I get 'em? Now answer, yes or no? - Ooo! Norman darling, let's go and sit down. Come on Norman, sit with us. - Have a seat, Norman. - Hello, Norman! - Hello, Norman. - Hello, and how are you? - All right, Oliver. My dear, do let me congratulate you. You must be terribly proud and happy tonight. Thank you! Somebody give me a drink! Oliver, nice of you to come to my venue. Vicki how are you? I've missed you, everyone's missed you. Have a nice trip? Well, a three months' tour of the theater circuit, scarecely comes under the heading of pleasure. But the way they're screaming for your pictures all over the country, Miss Lester, if I may talk shop: you are a knock-out. Thank you! It's good to hear that. You've been crying. A little. How's Norman? He's— Well, he's trying awfully hard, Oliver. Letting Norman leave the studio was the hardest thing I ever did. There was nothing else I could do. - I know. Has he been— Is he alright? He's gone to a sanitarium. He really wants to stop drinking. Well, I think he could, only.... Well, perhaps he could start working again. it would be some encouragement. Oh, Oliver, could you? Could you do that? Yes. Oh, thank you. But he mustn't ever know I told you. He won't know, and you mustn't worry. I want you to keep up your good work in this picture. I'll try, Oliver. It's the one thing I can do for you. [ door closes ] If you'll just sit here, Mr.Niles, I'll have Mr. Maine brought down. Thank you. 'Brought down' ? Mmmh. Hello Oliver! Welcome to Liberty Hall. Hello Norman! Yeah. No. No, Mr. Niles isn't slipping me a case of Scotch, Cuddles. This is just a handshake. [ Oliver chuckles ] This is Cuddles, Oliver, my social secretary. We--we go everywhere together. [ Oliver laughs ] - How're you feeling Norman? - Fine. I'm getting along remarkably well, Cuddles tells me. He says, you oughta see some of the boys. [ whistles ] [ both laugh ] Let's sit down. Eaaah. Cuddles, we-we really don't need you. Touching, isn't it? [ Oliver chuckles ] He can't bear to have me out of his sight! Are you comfortable here, Norman? - Comfortable? It's positively luxurious. Hey, they even have iron bars on the windows to keep out the draft. [ Oliver laughs ] How much longer are you going to be here? Oh, well, I'm really cured now, I'm just... ...staying on for an extra week or two to get in good shape, you know? After all, there is no, no particular hurry to return to the cameras. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've got a script with a fine part for you in it. Hey, Oliver, that's great. That's great. [ taps table twice ] Who, ah... who plays opposite me? Well, it is not exactly the lead. Young Pemberton's doing that, but I tell you frankly I find your part better than the lead. Oh, I see. It's, better than the lead? Well, of course, it isn't terribly long, but it's one of those parts that makes an impression on you. They'll be thinking about you all through the picture. - Mmh-hmh. Well, the thing is Oliver, I'm, uh, pretty well set at another studio. And I'm not at liberty at the moment to tell you which one, you know yourself how those things are. - Of course! But it's a big picture. It's one of the biggest of the year... and the part! Every actor in Hollywood would give his teeth to play it. [ Oliver chuckles ] Hey, well that's fine Norman, and naturally, that would tie you up for a while, but we won't get to this picture for some time. and perhaps, if you want to consider it for later on— Well, I tell ya Oliver, you'd better not count on me. See, ah, I've got several pictures lined-up after this one, and then they're talking to me about England and.... You know, that they're doing some very interesting things over there, you know? - Hm-hmm. - Hey! -Huh? What is it Cuddles? Speak right out. We all love you. - The dinner. - Oh! [ chuckles ] Here we dine at five thirty here, it makes the nights longer. [ Oliver chuckles ] Well, goodbye Norman. I'm glad to see you're getting along so well. I'll be out in no time. I'll have to introduce myself all over to a lot of people, they won't know me when I'm not drinking, ha. Goodbye. - Goodbye Norman. Thanks for dropping in. Well... [ door closes ] Well, Cuddles... alone at last, eh? [ 'Call to the Post' fanfare plays ] [ 'Call to the Post' plays again ] Oh, Burt, Sam... How are you Marion? - Oh, ah,Hello. - Hello. Hello, Norman. I'll see ya. How I hate to run into these has-beens. - They give me the creeps. - Me too. He was good while he had it. And he had it quite a while. - Hello - Hello Mr. Maine, I haven't seen you in a long time. - Ah, I've been resting. Ginger ale, please. Ginger ale and what? Ginger ale and... and ginger ale. A new leaf? A whole new book. Thank you. Scotch, straight. Hello Libby. Why it's Mr. America of yester-year. Do they let you wander about now without a keeper? - Oh, sure, I'm a-- I'm a trustee now. - Hm. I didn't expect to find you at Santa Anita. What do they do with the actors, well, while you're away? Oh, they cut 'em into slices and fry 'em with eggs. I suppose you'll be here all the time, now that you've retired from the hurly-burly of the silver screen. Well, with... living down in Malibu now, pretty lonesome with... ...Esther away working all day. Well, I wouldn't squawk about that if I were you. It's nice to have somebody in the family making a living. Ah, wait a minute, Libby... I don't want to forget that we're friends. Friends my eye. Say listen, I got you out of jams because I had to, it was my job, not because I was your friend. I don't like you and I never have liked you. Nothing made me happier than to see all those cute little pranks of yours finally catch up with you and land you on your celebrated face! Pretty work, Libby. Always wait 'till they're down, then kick 'em. I don't feel sorry for you. You've fixed yourself nice and comfortable. You can live off your wife now. She'll buy you drinks and put up with you, even though nobody else will. - Oh! Try and stop him! - You're disturbing the peace. Back up! [ mayhem ] Wait a minute, wait a minute... Come on outside for you, wise guy! I'm Norman Maine! - Well, that's not my fault. - Oh, don't bother to toss him out. He's harmless. - Alright, Mr. Libby if you say so. Sure, let him go, what can he do? He can't fight any better that he can act. Norman Maine... [ chattering ] Give me a Scotch... double. Leave the bottle here. [ Oliver sighs ] Vicki, you'll be ill. Why don't you try to get a little sleep? But he's been gone four days... four days and not a word. [ telephone rings ] Oliver, I can't. I just can't. Hello? No, this is Oliver Niles speaking. What? Where? Thank you. [ hangs up phone ] What is it? - Nothing, nothing. - Oliver tell me. He's in the night court. He's been arrested on a drunk charge and he's alright, he isn't hurt and I'm going right now to get him out. - I'm going with you. Vicki, it isn't any place for you and if it gets in the papers— What do I care about the papers? I'm going with you! [ gavel bangs ] Precinct 30, Municipal Court County of Los Angeles, now in session. The honorable George J. Parris presiding. Be seated, please. Were you able to do anything? The judge wouldn't even see me. Ready, your Honor. I want to advise you, that you are entitled to be represented by counsel, to be confronted by the witnesses that may testify against you, to compel witnesses to attend on your behalf, to a public and a speedy trial by the court, or by a jury, and the right to be admitted to bail. Call the first five. Gregory, Rails, Maine, Rodríguez, Johnson Come on boys, step in here! Go ahead, move along. - William Gregory -Yes, [ door closes ] eh, eh. Plain drunk, picked up at Fifth and Towne. Asleep in the gutter, 14 similar offenses in the past 6 months. Still at it, Gregory..? How do you plead? Eh, I don't feel so good. I didn't ask how you feel, I asked you how you plead! Guilty, I guess. When did you get out the last time? Err, day--day before Christmas. I'm sorry you'll have to miss New Year's. But you should be out in time for Washington's Birthday. Sixty days. Milton Rails. A plain drunk. Picked up on Brooklyn Avenue. Given treatment at Receiving Hospital, then removed to jail. How old are you, Rails? Uh, seventeen, sir. Did you take a good look at those men in the cell with you last night? Yes, sir. And have you taken a good look at yourself this morning? Well, no sir. Well, I suggest that you do. Five dollars and two days. Sentence suspended. Oh, judge! I— Alfred Hinkel! More commonly known as Norman Maine. Eh, drunk and disorderly. Cracked car into a tree at Sunset and Coronado. Evidently been drinking for days. Resisted arrest and injured one of his arresting officers. How do you plead? Guilty. You're Norman Maine, the actor, aren't you? You've come pretty low, haven't you? There isn't a man here who's had the advantages you've had. Look what you've done with them. You're nothing but an irresponsible drunk. Driving about the streets with the power to inflict death or injury on innocent people. I believe we better deny you that power for a while. Ninety days in the City jail. Please wait. I'm his wife. Yes, I recognize you Miss Lester. Please, Judge. I promise you, this won't happen again. I'll be responsible for him, if you just won't send him there. Do you realize that this man, when drunk, is obviously a menace to public safety? and you realize too, Miss Lester, the responsibility you'll be assuming to this court and to the commonwealth? I do. Sentence suspended. Prisioner remanded to custody of wife. Thank you. You can get him at the jail entrance, madam. José Rodriguez. Plain drunk. Picked up at First and Main. Second offense. How do you plead? Well, I think I'm guilty, your honor. Sixty days. Hey, Honey, I'm so tired of this— - Hold it, Mr. Maine, a picture! - Oh no, please. - What about a statement for the press? Oh no. Please, no, no! He's still asleep. He's been sleeping all day. That's the best thing for him. It's awful to see this happen to someone you love, and know in your heart that it can't get any better. I only know that, all I can do now is stay with him and try to help him. So will I. And between us, we'll take care of him. You're very fond of him, aren't you Oliver? I'm very fond of both of you. Then, I know you'll understand what I have to tell you. And after what happened last night, I think you already know what it is. I can't do any more pictures. I'm going away for good with Norman. You can't do that Vicki. You're at the very peak of your success... and you've worked so hard to achieve it. That's what's best for Norman. And I've thought it all out. Maybe, if I hadn't been away from him so much, last night and what went before it wouldn't have happened. Oh, I know it's too late to think about that now, but... ...it may not too be late to go away with him and start over somewhere. It's your life you're giving up Vicki. So I can try to give Norman back his. Can you honestly tell me I'm wrong to do it? No Vicki, I can't honestly tell you that. Then there'll be no more... Vicki Lester. Come on, walk to the door with me. Goodbye, Vicki Lester. You were a grand girl. Good luck, Mrs. Norman Maine. Goodbye. [ door closes ] [ Esther crying ] Hey, Darling! This is Maine coming in to apologize again. Stop, I'm sorry Dear, but... It-it isn't you. What other troubles have you got? Ah, none. [ sighs ] I was just playing a scene with myself. Now look, I'm just coming out of the jitters and your just going into them. This is a swell household. Isn't it? I tell you what we'll do. I'll promise to brace up, if you'll go on the wagon. [ Esther chuckles ] I guess I have been drinking too mch. You know what I'm gonna do, I'm going to be an athlete. You mean with great big muscles and everything. Well, roughly speaking, ah. You're gonna join the YMCA? Nah, it'd cost too much. I'm going wading out in our front yard. - Now? - Sure! Would you like me to go with you? Sure, if you'd like to. Normie, I don't think I will. It might spoil this beatiful, natural wave. Yeah, I guess that's right. Darling, look, ah, could you have a hot toddy read—, um, I mean, some hot soup for me, when I come back? Some hot soup. Yeah, and I'll make some of those nice sandwiches. Norman, do you have to? [ both laugh ] Go on now. Now, don't stay in too long. Hey! Do you mind if I take just... one more look? First drink of water he had in twenty years. And then, he had to get it by accident! [ Bartender chuckles ] Pardon me, how do you wire congratulations to the Pacific Ocean? [ Bartender laughs ] There she is now! Oh! You can't see her face! Hello Vicki! [ mayhem ] [ Danny ]: Get away, can't you? - Come on, Vicki! Let's see your face. Vicki, will you sign my book for me? Write "Mrs. Norman Maine". - Don't you care, Vicki. You'll get over it. Stand back, can't you? Don't you cry, Dearie! He wasn't so much! [ Esther screams, cries ] Do you mind if I take just... one more look? Here are the paychecks for the servants, Graves. You'll find a very nice bonus in each one. Miss Lester asked me to thank you for your kindness and service. If there is anything I can do for the little lady, I should be glad to do it. She would appreciate your attending to the closing of the Beverly Hills house. Put down those trunks. Put it down, I say! Well? Where is she? I-In the bedroom. Who are you? Oh, I'm her grandmother. Get out of the way! [ Auld Lang Syne begins playing ] Granny! - Esther! - Granny, darling! Oh I'm so glad to see you! What made you come? Oh I know when I'm needed. Now get out of here! Go on... get out of here, all of you! I want to talk to my granddaughter alone. I came just as quickly as I could. But I'm going home. I sent you a wire yesterday. Hm! Sit down! Is it true that you're going to quit the movies? I never want to hear of them again. What are you running away from little girl? I'm not running away, it... it's just that I can't go on, my heart isn't in it anymore. Once I told you that to get what you want, you to have to give your heart in exchange. And you said, you were willing, remember? I remember. Well, It seems to me that you got more than you bargained for. More fame. More success. Even more, personal happiness. Maybe, more unhappiness. But you did make a bargain and now you're whining over it. I don't think I'd feel so very proud of myself, if I were you, Esther. I'm not Granny, but my mind's made up. Well, then I'm sorry I gave you the money to come out here, it was just wasted. - Oh, but Granny— - I was proud of you Esther. I was proud to be the grandmother of Vicki Lester. It gave me something to live for, now, I haven't any. I know. Oh, I-I want to be strong, but I-I can't go on. I can't! You must. Tragedy is a test of courage. If you can meet it bravely, it will leave you bigger than it found you. If not, then you'll have to live all your life as a coward. Because no matter where you may run, you can never run away from yourself. I never knew Norman Maine. He wrote me a very sweet letter when you were married. He said you told him how much I meant to you. And I know just how much you must have meant to him. You know, Esther, I can't believe that whenever he is, he can be very happy, knowing that his death broke the spirit of the little girl he praised me so highly for raising. and I can't believe that he can be very proud knowing that all his great love did for you was to make you a quitter. The car is ready Miss Lester. We'll have to go now to make the train. Put the car back in the garage. Oh Granny, I've been such a fool! [ Announcer ]: The entire picture industry has come to the Chinese Theater for this opening tonight. It has come to pay tribute to a great star, in a long-awaited return to the screen in what's been called: "her greatest performance." It has come to pay tribute to the girl herself. The girl who has won the heart of Hollywood. The girl who has won the heart of the world. Miss Vicki Lester! [ applause ] And if i'm not mistaken, Miss Lester's car has just driven-up. [ applause continue ] Yes, it is here! [ applause continue... ] I hope this doesn't scare you too much. I scare very slowly, young man! [Man]: Big smile folks, please! They'll have your mug— I mean your face, plastered across half the papers in the country tomorrow. - Hm. How do I look? - Oh, you look swell! You're a liar, but I like ya. [ Announcer ]: And here's Miss Lester's Grandmother. Won't you say a few words to the radio audience, please? Say something, Lettie. Heh. You know, we've got a thing like that back home, where they all listen-in on, but we call it a party line. [ Danny and Announcer laugh ] Won't you say something, please? They're listening. Maybe some of you people listening-in dream about coming to Hollywood. Maybe some of you will get pretty discouraged. Well, when you do, you just think about me. It took me over seventy— er, sixty years to get here, but here I am, and here I mean to stay! [ applause and laughing ] Thank you very much. [ applause continue ] Miss Lester. This microphone is on an international hook up. Throughout the world, your fans are hoping that you'll say a few words to them. Hello, everybody. This is Mrs. Norman Maine! [ applause and cheers ] [ music swells ]
