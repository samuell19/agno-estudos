You come walking through that door You won't wonder anymore If I've been dreaming about you There's mistletoe everywhere Thank you so much for doing this here, I had no time. Stop playing Laney Blu. Still a classic. That's off your Christmas album, right? We had a blast recording that album. It's my favourite time of year. Hard to believe it's been 10 years since you stole the country's heart on American Superstar. So, how does a girl from the Tennessee Hills find inspiration living in Malibu? Well, I just look out the window and imagine pine trees instead of palms, and snow instead of sand, and just like that, I'm right back in the Smokies. Well, there are whispers that you're going to be leaving country music in the rear view mirror. Let me guess, those whispers are probably coming from my manager, Danny. Well, it is true, I have a new pop album coming out next month. Yeah. New year, new me. That wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that your last two albums have slipped down the charts rather quickly? Are you worried? Worried? No. No, of course not. Growing up in the Smokies, you... you learn pretty quick that in order to have peaks, you've gotta have some valleys too. But I promise you, all these new songs on this new album they're all sugarplums, no coal. All sugarplums, no coal? That is a brilliant title for your article. Do we have everything we need here? Yes, thank you. It was terrific. - Thank you. - Thanks for your time. - Thank you. - This way. I know that look. Did it not go well? Those were all supposed to be softball questions. With a couple hardballs thrown in there. It's fine. She wanted to know about the new album, which is kind of hard to talk about since I didn't write a single song on it. That's what songwriters are for. Yeah, but I always write my own songs. Laney. Okay. I've got my manager's hat on now, and we've talked about this. You've had ten great years. Gold records, Grammys. But the last couple of releases have underperformed, and we can't wait around a whole year for you to compose new material for an album. One more like that and the label might drop you. I just wish I could write some new songs. Take the time you need, write those songs. That could be for the next album. Look, I know how much you love Christmas, so I got you an early present. I booked you to perform a set at Santapalooza in New York. Are you kidding? Santapalooza? That's... that's huge. - You are amazing! - Yes, I am. Speaking of which, come with me, I want to show you something. Okay, Beth. What do you think? - Looks great, right? - It's just... Really different from your usual style. But you do look hot. See? Even Beth agrees. I'm a genius. Yeah. I didn't say that. I don't know. My fans see me more as a jeans and boots kinda girl. You think they're going to accept me looking like this? That was the old you. This, this is the new you. And when you step out on that stage on Christmas Eve, your fans will go wild. Wait, I'm performing on Christmas Eve? Eight days from today. And because of the new choreography, and the rehearsals, and all the media interviews, we need you in New York ASAP to get ready. But I told my mom I was going to spend Christmas with her. I haven't been home for Christmas in about five years. I want my girl to be happy. Okay, I can't give you Christmas Eve. But if you promise to be in New York by the day after tomorrow at the latest, I'll just tell them to eat it. Okay, I guess so. Thanks, Danny. Anything for you. Santapalooza's huge. It's going to be awesome. But missing Christmas Eve? What... what am I going to tell my mom? Doesn't sound like there's much of a choice. I was really looking forward to putting my feet up. I've spent the last three months in a recording studio. And there is no better place to relax than Baxter Mountain. I mean, there is one road in and one road out. - Sounds charming. - Oh, come on. You would love it if you visited. Yeah, it's this beautiful little snow globe of a town. Although, if I'd stayed, I probably would've been desperate to leave. Instead I just write songs about girls who are desperate to leave. Whenever I go home, I just spend all my time hanging out with my old boyfriends. Then I remember why I left. Well, mine's long gone, and so am I. Hi. - Is this my rental? - I know, I know, Miss Blu. But we didn't have anything else left on the lot. It's such a busy time of year. Is it all right? Yeah, it'll be fine. It's only for one day. I really appreciate that. Can I just say I am a huge fan. Also, I got married last year to that song of yours, "Promise." Thank you. I love hearing stories like that. You sure you don't want me to find you a driver? Oh no, it's fine. I prefer to drive myself anyway. It's the only time I get peace and privacy. Well, just be careful. The radio says there's a winter storm that might be coming our way. That's fine. I'll be in New York by then anyway. - Hi. - Hi. - How can I help you? - Could I get a coffee cake please? - Temperature's dropping outside. - There's a front coming in, right? Yeah. Big snow's coming. - You know, your boyfriend's really hot. - What? The personal trainer you're dating, of course. I'll take all of 'em. - Laney! - Mama! - I brought your favourite coffee cake. - Bless your heart. - I'm so glad you're here. - Me too. Isn't that car a little small for around here? It's fine. I am so glad you made it. I mean, seeing you in LA just is not the same as having you home for Christmas. Oh, Mom, about that. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on Christmas. - I have to leave tomorrow. - No! You haven't been home in years, and the last time you were, it was only for a weekend. I just had so many things planned. I was going to make all your favourite meals and we were going to decorate a tree, and... I know, I'm so sorry, Mom, but this huge opportunity came up, and I just, I'm not in a place to say no to it right now. But you're a star. They can't tell you what to do. Star hanging by a thread. Oh, my goodness. Did I make a wrong turn and end up in Santa's workshop? I have been helping to make decorations for the Christmas festival, and I've been so busy with all this I haven't even had a chance to put up my own tree. - Do you want some coffee? - Yes, please. Oh, my goodness, I love this picture. This was the one Dad kept in the lobby of his theatre. That's right. I see the theatre's for sale now. I have no idea who's going to buy it, but I sure hope it's somebody who knows how to manage it properly and can bring in some interesting acts. Like Dad? Like Dad. Here you go. Hey. How's the new stove working out? I love it, thank you so much. And thank you for all the renovations in this house. You could get a whole new one. Bigger, if you want. No, no, this is big enough and it's just as solid as the day your father and I bought it 30 years ago. Just gotta know its quirks. Kinda like you. Oh, goodness. Now. Why don't you tell me all about this personal trainer you're dating? Mom, what did I tell you about those tabloids? - You can't believe a single one of 'em. - I know. And that's why I am so glad you're here, because I'm getting one story in one newspaper, and one story in another one, and now I want it all cleared up, and we have all night. Oh goodness. Okay, so we have fresh towels in the bathroom, and some soap, and if you like, I'm pretty sure that I have some shampoo just underneath the sink. Mom, I'm an adult, I travel with my own toiletries. Well, you never know. You might've forgotten something. Okay, you. You have a wonderful sleep. You know I will. - Night, Baby. - Night, Momma. What the... Hey! Good morning sleepyhead. Mom, it isn't even 7:00. I know. I let you sleep in. - What was all that ruckus? - That was just George. He had some extra firewood. George from the market? So he brought it over just a cord which I thought was very nice. Instead of flowers, they bring firewood. I forgot how things work around here. Please. George is not interested in me, and I don't need a fella. Come on. You two would be perfect for each other. You're Chatty Cathy, and from what I recall, he is Mellow Mike. How about breakfast? Oh, honey. They are just beautiful. Now we have talked about this, I don't have anywhere fancy to go to wear these. Or... I don't want you spending all this money. Who else am I going to spend it on? Well, wait till the girls in the book club see these. All right, my turn. Okay, what's it gonna be? What's it gonna be? Oh, Momma. Knitted slippers, I love them. Thank you. I know it doesn't get very cold in LA, but my gosh, it's hard to shop for the woman who has everything. Well now, I don't have everything. Knitted slippers, for one. Thank you so much. Well, if you could stay longer, we could go Christmas shopping and take in the festival. Mom. Let's not spend our time talking about the time we don't have. Fine. But we did get a little bit of snow last night, and oh my gosh, it is so pretty outside. And if you stay just one more day, it'd be so much more Christmassy. Momma, believe me. I'd love to stay. But this opportunity's just way too big to pass up. Speaking of which, I should probably take off. My flight's in a couple hours and it's starting to get dark out there. Okay. Thank you for my slippers. I love them so much. Oh, my goodness, thank you. Now you drive carefully. You know what the roads are like here with all that snow. All I gotta do is make it over the pass, then it's just a straight shot on the interstate to Knoxville. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. I love you. You remember, the next time you are gonna stay here longer. - You promise? - Promise. Merry Christmas, Momma. I love you. I love you too. I miss you already. Hello? Hey, you. I got you booked in at the W. And you're meeting with the choreographer tomorrow morning at 7:00 and I've got interviews scheduled for you back to back after rehearsal. Yeah, that sounds great, Danny. Thank you. Listen. I'm... I'm going to have to hang up. 'Cause it's gotten dark and there's a lot of snow. I just have to get to the interstate. Okay, be safe, and we will definitely hit the ground running as soon as you get in. Okay, great. Yeah. I'll... I'll call you when I land in New York. All right, bye. Hey! Are you all right? Oh, my goodness, thank you. - Robbie? - Laney? - What are you doing here? - I'm doing my job. - Are you hurt? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. 100 percent. Okay, good. Then what in the world are you doing trying to pass a snowplow in a snowstorm? Well, you were going so slow you were a road hazard yourself. Please. Obviously, your driving hasn't improved living in California all those years. Well, that's very funny. Here... Come on, let's get you out of this cold. Well... - You gotta come this way. - All right, just... - Here, give me your hand. - I'm coming. - Come on. - Oh, goodness. Here. Thanks. So... How you been? Last time I saw you, you were headed out west for the superstar auditions and when you got picked for the show you kind of disappeared. You never were good at history, were you? No, I went to LA, you went to Boston, we agreed to meet up at some point, I even got you tickets to the finale and you never showed up. Yeah, well, it's all water under the bridge anyway. So, how's Lori? Sister's good, she got two kids now, keep her pretty busy. Listen, as much as I am enjoying our little reunion, I need a taxi or a tow truck or something. I... I have a plane leaving out of Knoxville in under two hours. There might be a plane leaving Knoxville in two hours but you're not going to be on it. What do you mean? Well, it might just be snowing down here, but up in the pass it's a total whiteout. I mean, the road out of town is closed. No. No. I have a Christmas Eve show to prep for in New York. I don't know what to tell you. I mean, that's Baxter Mountain for you. One road in, one road out. So, until the snow stops, you're stuck here. Laney? Oh, my goodness, you called ages ago. I was starting to get worried. What took you so long? Well, someone insisted that the rental be towed to a mechanic, so, there's two hours of my life I'll never get back. Safety first. He's putting snow tires on. I have to admit it's... it's pretty funny seeing the two of you together again. We're not together. Okay, it was just a figure of speech. Oh, honey. I am so sorry that you are stranded. But I have to say, this is such a perfect Christmas present for me. Well, I should get going, keep clearing those roads. Well, thanks for the ride even though it's all your fault. I'll see you around. Don't say a word. - Danny? - Yup? I've got some bad news. I'm stuck in Baxter Mountain. What? Give us a second. You're supposed to be here in New York. I know, but the roads are closed because of the snow. It's out of my hands. We need you here, rehearsing. Everyone is expecting you. I know. Can you just stall for me? I'm... I'm sure the roads are going to open up by morning. Fine. I just want you to focus on being ready to perform that new song for the first time. - I mean, this is live, Laney. - Absolutely. And you're sure there is no way to get you out of town tonight. Well, not unless you've got some flying reindeer and a sleigh. Kind of hard to get this time of year, but I'll see what I can do. - Bye now. - All right, bye. And now for the weather. Winter storm Megan is just not backing down. So, with more snow in the forecast, the National Weather Service is warning of hazardous travel conditions and up to a foot more snow at higher elevations, a travel advisory... I am stuck. I am sorry about your schedule, honey. But I have to admit, I'm just tickled that I get to keep you longer. My manager's gonna kill me. Well then, I think you should just die with a smile on your face. Honey glazed cinnamon bun? Momma, you know that I don't eat gluten or sugar. Now, don't you give me grief. Honey is god's sugar. - You don't have to fuss over me like this. - Nonsense. Every time I see you in LA, you spoil me. Well, finally I get a chance to spoil you back. So? How is it, getting reacquainted with Robbie? Mom, he just gave me a ride home, that's all. - And did you get along? - Not exactly. He seems to be under the impression that I was the one that dumped him, so. Well. I always thought that you two made such a lovely... - Okay, next subject, please. - All right. While you're here with this extra time, you're going to try maybe writing some songs? - What's the subject after that? - Lori? You gonna go and see Lori? You know she asks about you all the time. Even best friends can have a falling out. I know, why don't I make some cookies, and you can go and bring 'em to her? Now just hold on there, Sleigh Bell Sue. I have Santapalooza to get ready for, and once this road clears up, I have to go. Well then, that's fine. But until then, you are all mine, and we are going to do all the Christmassy things that we did when you were little. We're going to set up the lawn Santa, and then we are going to go and get a Christmas tree, and then we are gonna binge watch all those Christmas movies. Okay, well first I... I have to rehearse and before that, I need some coffee. Coming right up. No, no. I'm going to go into town. I need something more industrial strength. You need anything? Nope, I got you. What more do I need? - Love you, Momma. - I love you back. What am I gonna do with all this food? - Good morning George. - Morning. - Like your window display. - Thanks. Laney Blu! Hey, Mom said to say thank you for the firewood. Oh well, sure. My pleasure. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas! - Hello? - Hey. I heard you got snowed in. I'm so sorry. At least now you get to have your white Christmas! Yeah, well. Not by choice. Well, we're working on getting you out of there ASAP. Well, keep me posted. Danny wants you to keep a low profile. He's telling the press that you're holed up in the Bahamas recording your next album. The Bahamas? Why? I guess reminding the world that you're from Tennessee doesn't help with the rebrand. So maybe try to keep a low profile? Listen, as nice as it is to be home, keeping a low profile is just fine by me. Perfect. - Do you need anything else? - Yes. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Oh! Oh, my goodness! Well, there it is... So much for a low profile. Sorry, I gotta go. - Bye. - Laney... Oh, my goodness. Well. Laney Blu! Janine, wow. I haven't seen you since high school. I was only supposed to be here... ...for a quick visit. But, I guess I'm snowed in. I guess you're stuck here now, just like the rest of us. - Table for one? - No. I was just going to get a triple soy latte to go, please. We don't do soy lattes. You could have a coffee with creamer. For you, I'll even change the filter. Sounds perfect. You can wait at the counter. Great. Sorry. Laney, it's me. Lila Nelson. - I used to cut your hair. - Yeah. I hate to be a bother, but do you mind signing this for me? Sure. Sure. It's so good to see you back in town. Let me know if you want to come in for a quick touch-up. I think you'd look so much better with a centre part, just a little more up to date. Yeah. - Thank you. - Bye. You know, for whatever it's worth, I think your hair looks perfect the way it is. Oh, my goodness. Don't you have a road to clear somewhere? For your information, I was up all night on the job, thank you. Yeah, but you don't understand. I need to get to New York. You know, you're not the only one affected by this road closure. The town's mail, its deliveries, and many of its families are stuck on the other side, okay? Well, I'm sorry about everybody else, but I need to get to New York. I have a very important job to do. Look, princess. I'm sure everyone in LA falls all over themselves for you, but around here, everyone gets treated equally. Maybe you forgot that. I'm not asking for special treatment, I'm just asking for you to do your job. What's the name of your personal assistant? Beth, why? Well my name's Robbie, and I think you might be mistaking me for her. Okay. Well, enjoy your reading. I'm sorry I have to do this, but I'm going to go talk to your boss. You be my guest. Mayor usually gets in in about 10 minutes. It's everywhere. Excuse me. Robbie. Well, you're... You're the mayor? Yeah. Now how may I help you? Well, you didn't tell me you were mayor of Baxter Mountain. Well, you didn't ask. Last night you were working a snowplow. Yeah. See, I think it's important to find out what's really happening on the ground, or in the air, as the case may be. I wear a lot of hats around here. For example, now I have to put a couple hours in to organizing the Christmas Festival. Ella Jennings usually organizes it, but she's come down with the flu. So, I've taken on that as well. Seems like you have a problem saying no to everybody but me. Okay, look. Laney. I am doing everything I can to get that road open, okay? I've even brought on extra help. But it's gonna take time. Time is the one thing I don't have. Yeah. Me too. So maybe you can help me out. And in the process, free up more time for plowing. How's that? The last night of the festival is the big Christmas concert, but unfortunately half the musicians probably won't be able to make it because they live on the other side of the pass. Now if you, Laney Blu, were willing to lend a hand and help recruit talent, then that would give me more time to try and open the roads. Are you seriously asking me to do your job? One of them. Look, Mister Mayor. Just because you can't handle the 99 jobs you took on doesn't make it my fault. Get the road open. It's great catching up. What do you think? Now would this be Dasher or Blitzen? Well, it can't be Dasher. You know I love Baxter Mountain, but, nothing moves quick around here. What is his deal anyway? - Who's that, Blitzen? - No, Robbie. He didn't tell me he was the Mayor. How did he end up back here, anyway? Well, I heard that after college he got this big job at an architectural firm in Boston-thank you. Then he moved back home here to Baxter Mountain two years ago, he ran last year, he won big-time. I mean, do you know that he took over 70 percent of the votes? And you know how hard it is for Baxter Mountain to agree on anything? Well, it just seems like something you could've told me, is all. Thought you didn't want to hear about Robbie. Look. My old guitar. That was the best Christmas when y'all got me that. That was your Dad's idea. Thought you'd take to it, and boy was he right. - Oh, my goodness! - What? My old notebooks. I used to write down all my song ideas and lyrics. I remember. Okay. I think we have enough ornaments, we just need a tree to hang them on. So, let's get going. Mom. I gotta start working on my choreography. This is only gonna take a few minutes. See now, this one's nice. And look at that. That is a very sensible price. Come on, Mom. It's missing a whole bunch of branches. Okay. So, what about this one here? That's more like a Christmas tumbleweed than a Christmas tree. Oh my... Come on, Mom, I'm buying, so the sky's the limit. Now that's a great Christmas tree. Well see, now that one's enormous. I mean, why do you want to continue to spoil me? - Who else am I gonna spoil? - That is precisely why you need a fella. Oh, my goodness. I could say the same thing about you. Hey Lori? Susannah, hi honey. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Good to see you. Laney, hi. Well, I heard you were back in town. Robbie said he ran into you. You look great. Can't remember the last time I saw you. That would be about High School graduation. - How long you back in town? - Depends on the storm. Just waiting for the road to clear up. - Are you Laney Blu? - That's me. And what's your name? This is Emily, and this is... this is Little Jack. Hey. Well, it's nice to meet you. And where's that husband of yours? He's not around. Oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry. That must be so hard, raising the two little ones by yourself. No, nothing like that. Ed works construction over in Knoxville so he's stuck because of the storm. Well that makes two of us. Wish we could swap places. Yes, sweetie? What is it? Oh, honey. No, I think Laney's much too busy for that. Mom! What is it? Emily wants me to invite you for dinner tomorrow night. I... I'm sure you already have plans, so... Well, I would love to, but, I'll probably be gone by then. And if I'm not, I'll probably be squeezing in some time with my momma, so. That's fine, right? No worries. Actually... I'm having dinner with the festival volunteers tomorrow night. So, if you're still here, you're free. Okay. Well, that... Great. Why don't we say 6:00, 6:00? Great. Yeah, that'd... that'd be great. I'll... I'll give you my... my phone number, and you can text me the directions. Laney, we live a block from your Momma's. White house, big snowman out front. Of course. Alright you say bye. - Bye. - Bye! Say bye? Cat's got her tongue. - Okay, let's go. - All right. See you later! She touched my glove! Oh, my goodness. - Momma. - What? She clearly did not want to invite me. She was only doing that to be polite. Goodness, I'm so embarrassed. And even if I am still here, I have to use that time to practice my choreography anyway. You two used to be the best of friends. Yeah, well, things change. - Looks like I found your tree. - What tree? - Right here. - Well that's just too big. Now you shush and let me do this for you. Honest to goodness. - Excuse me, sir. - Hi. Can you deliver this tree? Sorry. We don't do that. But don't worry, I know a guy with a truck that could probably help out. Hey, Robbie! Hey. Don't tell me this is another one of your jobs. Actually, no. I'm meeting Lori to help haul her tree home, and just loaded it on my truck. Well here's the thing, Robbie. I have to stop by the festival volunteer office, and I was wondering if perhaps maybe you could haul our tree and Laney in your truck and, you know, take it home. Sure, yeah. No, I should have room for two trees and a country star, but might require another trip for her ego, though. - Ha, ha, that's very funny. - Yeah. This is the tree. Get to hauling it. Jason, you want to give me a hand? Look. Before you grill me again, the roads may be mostly clear down here, but the pass is still snowed in. Now we can probably get you out by tomorrow though, if that works for you. - What choice do I have? - Well, pretty much none. What happened to us? - What do you mean? - Why don't we ever talk? Why... why didn't you call all these years? You were dating rock stars. - So that ship had pretty much sailed. - Robbie. None of that was real. Well. One thing hasn't changed. Baxter Mountain is still as beautiful as ever. You remember the old soda fountain? Mr. Abercrombie's place? Sure. Yeah, that's where you took me for our first date. We went to get ice cream and you forgot your wallet so I had to pay for everything. I was nervous, okay? I was going on a date with my sister's best friend. Not to mention the prettiest girl in school, so... Anyways. They sold it and tore it down. It's these wealthy buyers from the city coming in and building these vacation homes. Snapping up all the property. Even your dad's old theatre is under threat. There's a proposal to tear it down for condos. Yeah, I saw that on my way into town. Still can't believe it. All my best memories are in that theatre. My dad used to sneak me backstage any time a band would come through town. It's where I first fell in love with music. That theatre is pretty much the heart of this town. That's what the Christmas festival is for, actually, to see if we could raise enough funds for a down payment to save the theatre. So, say you got the theatre. Then what? Come on. Where are you going? Behold, the Regional Art Centre for Smoky Mountain Culture. It's a little dream of mine. Did you make this? I mean, it's a long shot but if someone doesn't do something soon then we're just going to be another generic resort town with all the locals priced out of the market. You were always so talented. Remember when you made the blueprints for your dream house in high school art class? Might ring a bell. Look, I need to take these flyers about the Christmas festival before we take your mom's tree back, so. So now we're just going to run errands for you? It'll take a minute, all right? I gotta get back so that I can go over this choreography. It's right around the corner, come on. So, can I interest you in a snow globe ornament? - Or perhaps a mini stocking? - No, thank you. I'm... I'm all set on my Christmas decorations. All right, well you just let me know. Hey, can I ask you what brought you back here? Last I heard, you were up in Boston at some fancy architecture firm. Yeah, I was. - Things were going great. - So, what was the problem? There wasn't one, really. You know, I was on track to be partner, I was engaged to another architect in my firm. Yeah, every day we'd eat at this little park. And one day a new skyscraper started going up, cast a shadow on our little park. I realized it was a building I helped design. Because of me, that perfect little spot wasn't going to see sun anymore. From that moment on, I didn't want to do that kind of work. My fiancée thought I was crazy. You know, she said that it was just progress and people would get used to it. I don't know, I just disagree. So, you decided to come back here and be mayor and part-time snowplow driver? I decided to come back and open up my own architecture firm, but that dream is currently on hold because the only construction going up in this town are these cookie-cutter condos. You know, I could see the way things were headed, I just knew that nothing was going to change unless I did something about it myself, so, you know, I ran for mayor. Right here. So how do you expect to take care of a whole town when you can't take care of an itty-bitty road? Come on Laney, I would if I could, okay? Most of the talent that we invited for the concert cancelled because they can't even get here. We sunk a lot of the town's budget into this concert, so it is a big gamble for us. Now I've got to recruit local talent to replace them. The show needs at least five great acts. - My offer still stands. - You mean your ransom demands? You would be the perfect person to recruit local talent. I've got my own Christmas show to get ready for! Laney, it's Christmas, right? It's the season of giving? I mean, if you're going to be stuck here anyway, why not make a difference? You really think it's a good idea for us to be working together? I mean, I'm willing to call a Christmas truce if you are. Fine. I'm in. Shouldn't be too difficult. Not for you. All right. You walkin' on a time line... Towards the horiz... Towards the horizon for a good life So, would a snowmobile get me over the pass? Snowshoes? Sled dogs? Okay, believe me. I'm looking into every option. Meanwhile, Danny wants me to remind you that your big interview is tomorrow. Assuming you're not back in New York by then, we'll arrange the whole thing by Skype. Fingers crossed. If my fingers aren't already frozen. I'm sorry. Also, Danny wanted me to make sure that you've been rehearsing for Santapalooza? Tell Danny that I'm on it. But... I gotta run. Looks like there might be some good news around the corner. Okay, good. Bye! All right. Bye. Okay, what's the deal? You said the roads would be open by today. Well, you want the good news or the bad news first? Bad news. Always. There was an avalanche up in the mountain overnight and half of the pass came down, so now we're back to square one. Oh, no. This town just doesn't want me to leave. All right, what's the... what's the good news? The state stepped in with work crews to help out, so I'd say three days max we'll have you out of here. Three days? Are you joking? Listen, it's still enough time to get you to New York by Christmas Eve, all right? And in the meantime, you did agree to help out and round up some talent for me. Which I still intend to do, planning on asking Chauncey first. Remember he used to play fiddle in the bluegrass band he had. They were really great. Yeah, I don't think Chauncey plays fiddle anymore. Well maybe somebody just needs to ask him nicely. I've got a couple hours before dinner at Lori's, so maybe I can go over and convince him then. And I've got a couple more people on my list, including your sister. Yeah, no, hey. Good luck. I mean she hasn't sung in years, but maybe I'll pick you up after dinner. You know, just for a status update. Okay, fine. I'll go round up some talent and you go round up some snow. Yes ma'am. Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying. I'm not selling anything, Mr. Chauncey. I'm Laney Blu, you taught me music in high school? Oh yeah, you're the big-time singer. Well, I... I brought you a gift and an invitation to come perform at the town's Christmas concert. An invitation for me? I just remember your bluegrass band always playing in the gazebo in the park on summer nights... That was a long time ago. I don't play anymore so maybe you should go ask someone else. I... Okay. And this couldn't wait until after the early bird rush? Some of us work for a living, you know. I'm sorry, Janine. I'm just trying to find acts for the Christmas concert and I remember you playing banjo like nobody's business. For goodness sake, Laney. That was a lifetime ago, and I've got work to do. Okay, sorry. Got it. Bye. I hope third time's a charm. Well, I sure hope you're hungry, Laney. I am. I can't remember the last time I had meatloaf. That's kefta. That's lamb and beef. I'm trying out a new recipe. Laney, what's it like being a big star? Well... It's excitin'. There's the private jets and the red carpets, I guess. But it's kind of exhausting too. And you miss out on a lot, like sitting down at dinner with nice folks like you. Have you met Justin Bieber? Well, not really. I mean, I did a duet with him at the Grammys. - Seriously? - Yeah. But you know, my favourite duet was one I did with your mom. You know that we had an act together before, right? Mom? You sang with Laney Blu? - A long, long time ago. - Like a hundred years? Well, I can't believe it, they are finally asleep. That's great. Hey. You have such beautiful kids. Yeah, they are pretty great. - Can I help? - No, I'm fine. Well, I can at least pour some wine. That, you can do. Dinner was so great, thank you. Are you kidding? Thank you. It is not every day we have an actual country icon in our living room. My kids finally think I'm cool. Hey, I never really apologized for leaving you high and dry like I did. Our little duo was getting pretty popular before I flew the coup. We were supposed to get famous together. Well, life intervened. Ed and I were head over heels, and you were doing every open mic in the state, and just look where it got you. I would've just held you back. Oh, my goodness, no. Never. - Here. - Thanks. So, I hope you're still playing music. Well, does singing in the shower count? Because between that and lullabies, the only song and dance I do is raising the two kids and trying to make ends meet with Ed. Goodness, that is such a shame, because you have such a gorgeous voice. Could I maybe convince you into singing at the Christmas concert? Me? In... No. Come on. I'm trying to help Robbie put it together, but everybody I'm asking is saying no. Laney, I can't just get up there and perform after all these years. Look, I know it must seem crazy to you with your perfect world, but I'm actually really happy with my little life here. Well, your little life is pretty great. And trust me, my life is far from perfect. I never see my friends anymore, my career is taking a downward turn and goodness, I haven't written a song in almost a year. Sorry. I didn't mean to lay all that on you. Laney, you could always tell me anything and you still can. It's Robbie. We're going to go catch up tonight. Can I still tell you anything too? Of course. Okay. It was one thing when your career took off and we didn't go any further as an act. I was already pretty certain I wasn't going to make my life a music life. But Robbie, he was going to make you his life. Look, you're both adults and whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen. But he's my brother, Laney. And I don't ever want to see him hurt like that again. - Just be careful, will you? - I will. I promise. Only you would want ice cream on a freezing cold night like tonight. A debt's a debt. Now, we're even. So how come you stayed away so long? Well, I was recording and touring and recording some more, and then touring even more after that. And if you're not climbing the charts, then you may as well not be on them at all. - Oh, my goodness. - What's that? Well, according to my social media, I am jet skiing today in the Bahamas. Yeah. You can't believe everything you read. The tabloids even have me dating my personal trainer. What, you're not? No! Of course not. Look at that. That is a friend hug, not a boyfriend hug. All right, all right, I didn't believe it anyway. I don't have time to be seeing anybody anyway, since I've been rebranding myself as a pop singer. Which is why it's crucial that I get to New York. But isn't your... your brand or whatever about being authentic, if that's not like a massive contradiction? Yeah, I know. All my hit songs are about growing up here. To be honest, that well has run dry. The more I chase inspiration, the more it seems to escape me. Then maybe you just need to stop chasing it. You know? Maybe you just need to let yourself be surprised by things again. I don't know. But I do know I need to stop eating this, otherwise I will not fit in my costumes. Don't mind if I do. I gotta get back and learn this choreography. I gotta go home and try to balance the snow removal budget. Where is home for you now? Seriously? You're not going to tell me? You know I'm going to find out. Five, six, seven, eight. Tell me, is it all in my head, is it all in my head, is it all in my head, is it all in my head? Tell me... Mom! Goodness. - What on earth were you doing? - My new routine. That doesn't look like what you usually do. Yeah, that's... that's kind of the point. - You don't like it? - No, no. Don't take this the wrong way, but are you sure you're going in the right direction for you? No. No, I'm not sure, but I love what I do and if this is what I gotta do to keep it going, then I don't have much of a choice, do I? Then you just trust your instincts, because they brought you this far. What if my instincts aren't telling me anything on this one? I don't know, honey. But whatever you decide, you have my support. Thanks Momma. Gonna keep practicing. All right. Oh, gosh. Look at us baking together like old times, and you hanging out with Robbie. Just helping him with the festival, that's all. And how's that going? Even old Chauncey won't say yes. He used to be so nice. Remember when he used to decorate his house for Christmas every year? You do know that he lost his wife a few years back. Poor thing just hasn't been the same since. I'm sorry to hear that. But honestly, it isn't just Chauncey. Janine shot me down and don't get me started on Lori. Well honey, maybe folks around here feel a little rejected by you. Rejected, why? Well you have to understand that to folks here, you, you live a glamorous life they can only dream about. - You're different. - But I'm not different. Not really. And I know that, but they don't know that. Maybe what you need to do is just show them more the real you. I mean, think of yourself as a Christmas present. Can't know what's inside until you get past that bow and unwrap it. What? Mom, you just compared me to a Christmas present that the town would love to unwrap. And they will. Well, at least I know where I get my self-confidence from. This poor thing is so sad. Yours are so pretty. Mine looks terrible. So, you really think people think I'm standoffish? Maybe just a little. Okay, where you going? To go prove everybody wrong. Especially one person. Hello? What brings you out here? I just thought I should return something that's yours. My momma always taught me not to keep other kids' toys. Well, thank you. Robbie, you really did it. You built your dream house. Well, yeah. Why don't you come on in? Typical Robbie, you do something amazing and you don't even mention it. I kept the rustic lines of the barn, obviously upgraded the interior. It's beautiful. Yeah. This... this is where I go to unwind and relax. You know, let me grab you a coffee and make yourself at home. Still cream, no sugar? Yeah, all right. That's nice. What is it? It's just something I came across the other day. Might be the start of a little song, I don't know. - I like it. - Yeah, I don't know. It's something about being back in Baxter Mountain that's inspiring, I guess. Yeah. You ever turn that thing off? You're the mayor, they ever let you turn yours off? No. - Oh, shoot. - What is it? It's an interview that I forgot I had. You gotta do an interview right now? Why don't you just tell them... No, no, I have to take this. But they think I'm in the Bahamas so you have to shh-shh. I'm sorry, they think you're where? Hey, it's Laney. Laney, it's Alexandra. So good to speak to you. You too. Thank you for taking time from the studio. How's it down in the Bahamas? It's great. I just think the Caribbean rhythms are so inspiring. - And the weather's okay down there? - Oh yeah, it's great, why? You've got a fireplace in the Bahamas. Yeah. I asked them to set that up so I could get in the Christmas spirit. Great idea. Anyway. Everyone's waiting for your new album. Any hints on when it's going to drop? Soon. Real soon. I'm just experimenting with some new sounds is all. Well, Danny has been pretty secretive about it, but he said to expect some surprises at Santapalooza? Yes, I think it's safe to say that, Santapalooza's gonna show fans a whole new side of me. Anyway, I have got to get back to work because my... my recording engineer is hollering at me, so, Laney! Thank you so much for calling. I'll see you at Santapalooza, okay? Bye! You are so bad! Hey. If you're free tonight why don't you come by the Roadhouse with me? Perfect place to round up some talent. Yeah, I can... I can do that. I heard they have good Caribbean rhythms there these days so. Oh, well, great. You know I love a Caribbean rhythm. You remember we used to come here all the time? I sure do. Plenty of memories here. What's... what's with the hat? Just trying to keep a low profile. Hey. Hi, thanks so much for the invite, I'm so glad I could get a sitter. I haven't been out in ages. Hi, Laney. Hey Lori, I'm so glad you could make it. Yeah. - Should we sit? - Yeah, sure. - I love this place. - Sure is a lot of talent in here tonight. Thanks. Ladies and Gentleman, we got a genuine country star in our midst. So, give a hometown welcome to our own Laney Blu, back in Baxter Mountain. Laney Blu! Laney Blu! Laney Blu! So much for low profile, right? Just relax all right? You're among friends. Why do I feel like you had something to do with this? Laney Blu! Laney Blu! Come on down from your high horse, Laney. My horse is at just the right height, Janine, thank you very much. All right. Hey there, y'all. So happy to be here. My, you are mighty persuasive. I will sing a little something tonight, but not without my good friend, Lori. We're going to have a little reunion - of Buckley and Blu tonight. - No. But I'm going to need your help to invite her up here, all right? Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! - Laney I can't do this. - We're doing "The First Noel." Everything will be fine. I'm going to start without you, and you'll come in where you used to. It's like riding a bike. You'll pick it up. All right, you ready? Let's do it. - It's just like old times. - The best times I ever had. I need a drink. And we still need some talent for the Christmas concert. So, if you'd like to perform, come talk to this guy. And even if you don't want to perform, we hope you'll come out and support on Christmas Eve. All right, have a good night y'all. I'd say Baxter Mountain loved you. I'd say we're just getting reacquainted but it's fun. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's real fun. I used to play little clubs like this all the time. I miss it. Well, here's to second chances. I got a little confession to make to you. I didn't ignore your invitation to come out to California. I went out to LA and I... - I saw you in the Superstar finals. - You did? You never told me that. What... what happened? I waited there by the backstage door to surprise you, but when you came out, you just... you just got mobbed. All those fans and reporters and eventually I just turned around and left. Why? When I saw you there, with your life going in this... this whole new direction, I just didn't want to be the person holding you back. So, you just made that decision for the both of us? It was your big shot, and, I mean, I was headed off to Boston, I thought our lives were going in different directions, different futures. You still think that? How about a dance, huh? Say that again... It's a... it's a slow song, we better not. - If we dance, people will talk. - Yes, they will. Let's let 'em talk. All right. I just don't wanna misunderstand Say that again You realize the way my eyes adore you You understand you make this man survive All right, thank you so much. Nice to meet you. - Excuse me. - Janine. Didn't expect to see you get up there. But since you have come down off of your high horse, maybe I can come down off of mine, too. So, if you'll still have me, count me in for the concert. - That'd be great. - Okay. I'll be there Christmas Eve. - Okay. - Okay. Kinda nice to see you mending some fences around here, Miss Blu. Yeah, it feels real good, too. I gotta be honest, it's... it's... I think it's this place. I mean, being somewhere that I love, surrounded by people that I love... Excuse me, just a second. I'll be right back. - Hey, Lori? - Hi. Excuse me, I'm sorry y'all. Hi. Have you thought any more about singing in the Christmas concert? Now, just hear me out. I know I'm not going to be there on Christmas Eve, but if I wrote you a song, would you consider singing it? - Well, what about the kids? - Well, just bring 'em. I'm sure they would love to see their momma on stage. Okay, I will. I'll do it. Okay, but you got to get writing me that song. Okay, yeah. That's... I mean, that's the easy part. Now that I know who's singing it. - All right. - That's great, okay! - Thank you. - Bye. I'm glad it's not an election year, because I think I'd be out of a job real quick. I think you would too. Hey. I finally found the wreaths. And judging from that smile, I think maybe you found something too. I did hear you singing that melody again. Yeah, it's a little rough around the edges, but, I think it might be the start of a new song. - What is it? - It's Danny. He wants to know how the rehearsals are going for Santapalooza, which I have had no time for. Well that's interesting, because you seemed to find the time to go dancing with Robbie last night. I'm glad to hear the Baxter Mountain grapevine is still as quick as usual. Still the best way for rumours, recipes, and ribbing. I wonder what that grape vine would have to say about you and George. I am not interested in George. I can take care of myself just fine and I have been doing so ever since your father passed. All right. I'm just teasing you. All I'm saying is it wouldn't hurt you to think about going on a date. It's not a big deal. All right, I would love to carry on this conversation but I gotta get over to Lori's. Wait a minute, did you two reconnect? - I am so happy. - I know, me too. Did I tell you she's going to sing in the Christmas concert? No. Yeah, but I gotta get over to her house 'cause she picked up an extra shift at work and since Ed's out of town, I offered to babysit. What? Don't be so dramatic, I can handle it. It's only a couple little kids. All right kiddos, we are going to make some Christmas popcorn streamers. Oh dear. All right. Well, we'll clean that later. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. All right, so first we'll... Oh no. Oh no, no, no, those are for the tree! No, okay, all right. We need a... a broom or some... I'm gonna get you! Mom? Yeah. Yeah, I need your help. All right. So, popcorn didn't work out. Next, we are going to try to make Christmas cookies. I don't want to make cookies. It's no fun. - Is that so? - Hey darlin', I'm here. Well. It seems an elf has come by to bring us some Christmas spirit. That's not an elf. That's your mom. Well now, that is the wrong answer. Because I am both! Thanks for coming, mom. Did you get everything? I did, I got the dough. I got you aprons, I got you gumdrops, sprinkles, I also got you some Finnish Christmas cookies, and every single cookie cutter in the store. Thank you. Now, are you going to show everybody what to do next? No, no, you're going to show 'em. See, I... I think you're up for the task, right? Have fun! So, what are we gonna do? We are gonna make music. I thought we were gonna make cookies. We can do both. This is a little trick I learned from my dad. Now Jack, you are going to be our drummer. Those are for you. You're going to take these cookie cutters and you're going to stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp. You got that? And Emily, you are on rhythm, all right? These are going to be your little egg shakers. You're gonna go shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, okay? - Okay. - You got it? All right. And I am going to be... The guitar player. Look at that. Perfect. I'll strum it with one of these. You ready? All right Jack. I need you to stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp. You got it? Stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp, and shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake and strum, strum, strum, strum. Yeah, here we go. We got a little band going! Well hello. How was the babysitting? It went great, actually. Thanks for your help. - You decorated without me. - Yes, I did. It's habit. I couldn't help myself. And there's only three more days until Christmas. I'm so sorry I haven't been home for Christmas in a while. I just hate thinking that you have to do this by yourself every year. Yes, well, this year is special because you're here, and it's just like old times. Now look at this. - Do you remember this? - I do. Yeah, Dad got this at a craft store when we went to Pigeon Forge. Here's my little nutcracker that I made. I love that one, and I still remember the year that that arm fell off and your dad spent hours with tweezers and glue, putting it back together. I mean, he just loved that ornament. This one? Why this one? Because you made it, of course. I wish he was still here. He'd be so proud of you. I always thought that was one of the reasons you stayed away so long. All the memories of him here. Yeah, there's memories of him everywhere. In every corner, around every tree. I think that's why I threw myself into my work, to escape the pain. And you've been working yourself overtime ever since. I just wanted to make music, just like Dad wanted to make music and never really could. All your dad ever wanted was for you to do the one thing that you loved and for you to be happy. You know, he would be so pleased to be watching you, you know, putting this concert together, to help him save that theatre. How's that going? You know, I think it's actually going to be really great. Except there's still one holdout. What in the world? We just thought we'd do some decorating for you. Well, actually, it's called trespassing. Oh, but sir. When I was little, you and your wife had the best Christmas decorations in town. Why, it wasn't Christmas until you put your decorations up. - Well, that was a long time ago. - Well, I remember. Don't you? Look, I'm... I'm sorry if we overstepped. Now that you've gone to all this work, you might as well leave them up, I suppose. Thank you. So are you still looking for entertainers for that concert of yours? Yes, sir. Well, you can count me and my fiddle in, and I'll try to get my old bluegrass band together. Well, that's great! I swear this place still is magical. Thank you so much for your help with the decorating, mama. You did good, darlin'. Got it from your mother. Who's that? It's just me. That was beautiful. Just beautiful. Thanks. It's Christmas, I'm on a stage, I can't help myself. So how does it feel being back in here after all these years? Actually, it feels pretty great. Being in this town, being here, makes me really miss my dad. I've been thinking a lot lately about all the things he wanted for me. How many of those things actually came true. Sometimes it feels like it happened to somebody else. I always thought I had this dream life. Money, fame, travel, everything I thought I wanted. And? And it took coming home to realize what I was missing. Well, I mean obviously I wish you could stay to see everything that you've done for this town. But I mean, you've got to protect everything you worked for, I get that. I just hope that you know, Laney. I'm so proud of you, and he would be too. Thanks, Robbie. It means a lot. But, you know, we still can have a special Christmas even though I'm leaving. Oh yeah? I'm putting together this little dinner at my mom's house, just to say thank you to the folks who have helped out. - You want to come? - Boy, absolutely. - You found it. - Look at that! George, that is quite the bouquet you have there. I brought some kindling to start things up, some cedar to get the flames going, and birch to keep the fire going all night long. Just need a spark. Hey! Well, looks like you already got one. Chauncey. You made it. I brought some bread pudding I cooked up. My wife's old recipe. We're so glad you're here. You can put it over there. All right everybody, I just wanted to say a few words before we eat. All right, first of all, I just want to say thank you all so much for coming. It's real good to know your neighbours. A toast to a real special woman, one who made tonight possible. Winter storm Megan. Bless her heart. All right, come on let's eat, y'all. All right. You know, I think Lori's still on cloud nine after that singing she did the other day. So, thanks for that. You don't have to thank me for anything. She's a natural. So, I noticed you came by yourself. Is that your, your not so subtle way of asking me if I'm seeing anyone? Well, you know me, that's about as subtle as I get. Well, when you are part-time mayor and snowplow driver of Baxter Mountain, Tennessee, you gotta fight the women off, but nah, there's... there's nobody right now. You sure there's no other rock stars I should know about? I thought we'd already been over this. Just asking. Yeah, well there's nobody. So, what's the update on the snow, Frosty? We were really, really hoping by today, but I'm almost sure tomorrow. All right, well, I may be trapped in a snow globe, but at least it's a pretty one. Laney! Danny? Santapalooza, here we come! Hi. My manager. - So, the road's finally open? - A couple of hours ago. And I chartered us a private jet to get us to New York City by tomorrow morning without any more hitches. That's... that's great. Well, desperate times call for desperate measures. - Who's this? - An old friend. Danny, meet Robbie. Hey. Nice to meet you. You're handsome. He's handsome. Laney, we're leaving first thing tomorrow morning. Okay. Hey, Danny. Why don't I show you to your room. No, that's fine. I think we should go over some... Oh, please. Come on, I insist. I... I'd like to show you your room. No, it's... I can stay at the saloon or whatever you got. No, it doesn't come with breakfast. No, I saw it on the way. So. You've got to leave. Have to. My whole career is riding on this. Kind of feels like history's repeating itself. Us going our separate ways yet again. Robbie. We can plan on meeting up after all this is over. We tried that once, remember. I just think if you want something to happen, you have got to make it happen. Otherwise it's just... it's just way too easy to let life slip by and pretend there was nothing you could do about it. But hey. Thank you so much for, for all your help with the show. We couldn't have done it without you, so... You didn't need my help. But it was the most fun I've had in a long time. Merry Christmas, Robbie. Merry Christmas, Laney. You have a safe flight. Thought you might be hungry. I don't have much of an appetite right now, but thank you. Are you sure you're doing the right thing, leaving for New York? I can't just throw it all away. All that I worked for. I understand. I'm just so glad that you got stuck here. This has been the best Christmas in years, and I miss you already. Me too. This week's been great, and I promise I'll come visit again soon, all right? Okay. All set? Jet is all fuelled and we'll be in New York in no time. Thanks, Danny. Hey, Laney? Pumpkin loaf, soy latte for the flight. Thanks, Momma. Oh, I almost forgot. There's an envelope on my bed for Lori. It's got the music in it for the song that I wrote for her. Just tell her I said good luck? Oh, honey. It's too bad you couldn't give it to her yourself. You know I'm not good with goodbyes. Especially this one. I love you. I love you more. Bye. Perfect. We are just rolling in now, so fire up those engines. All right. We will be good to go in five minutes. Great. And maybe when you get on the plane, you want to put on a new outfit. There'll be photographers on the ground when we get to New York. Yeah, I'll be ready. And the president of the record label wants to meet with you later. She's got some great ideas about the rebrand. Laney? Laney. - You listening? - Yeah. Really? I just helped put together this Christmas concert in Baxter Mountain and I feel like I'm skipping out on 'em. Well, you've got your own Christmas concert, remember? And if I don't do it? That would be a big mistake. Well... At least I've got pumpkin bread. Ooh, sounds yummy. What's that? Just something my mom put in there. We're here. Danny, how long you been my manager? Eight years. No, nine years. And you're really good at it. You really are. Thanks. I'm just trying to do my job and trying to keep the trains running on time. But Danny... On top of being an amazing manager, I need you to be my friend today. Friend? I don't know how to do that. Hey, hey. It's a packed house. I mean, I can't figure it out. We only sold advance tickets for like, half the seats. This is going to put us over the top for redevelopment. Laney tweeted to her three million followers. Now that the road's open, people have come from all over. You gotta be kidding me. Lori, Lori. Hey, Lori. Hey, you're up next, okay? Are you joking? - Have you seen all the people out there? - Yeah, it's a packed house. I can't do this. I can't do this. It is one thing to sing a duo with Laney on a dare in a half-packed club. It is another to sing a solo out there in front of a crowd like that. I can't do this. Just breathe. All you gotta do is breathe. Don't tell me how to breathe. I know how to breathe. I... I can't sing in front of all those people, Robbie. - I can't sing... - Gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine. But Buckley and Blu can. Laney? What are you doing here? I thought y'all might need some backup. Yeah, seriously. Hey, don't you worry about that new song, all right? I'll take care of it. Then you come meet me on stage after and we'll do our old Christmas song, just like the old days. - All right? - All right. I'd love that. Yeah. Okay. - Yeah. - Okay? Yeah, I think I can do this. - First, I gotta throw up. - No, it's just... One minute! Robbie, stop being so bossy. So, you passed up Santapalooza? - You sure about that? - Absolutely. You know we got a full house 'cause of you. Well, I gotta protect my investment. Your investment? Don't tell me you bought this place. You bought this place! You bought... Well, I mean. It won't be official until after the holidays, but come the new year, this place should be mine. I will be needing an architect to make sure all the future developments go off without a hitch. Well, I might know somebody. I am thinking about making this my home base, too. I could tour from outta here, so long as someone keeps the road open. I might know somebody for that, too. - Robbie! - Ja... nine. There's nobody on stage. Get out there and introduce the next act! Come on! Shoot, I gotta, just... Thank you. You're welcome. Turns out you're not so stuck up after all, Laney. You're almost like a real person. Well, thank you, Janine. I like you, too. Well, folks. It... it might be only Christmas Eve, but we have got a very, very special Christmas surprise for you all tonight. So, without any further ado, I'd like to present to you local gal. You may know her. Ladies and gentlemen, Baxter Mountain's own Laney Blu! Hi! Laney! Thank y'all so much for coming out tonight. Oh, my goodness, I know I wasn't supposed to be here, but I just couldn't miss out. Oh, my goodness, my dad would've loved to have seen y'all here. This theatre is more than just a building, it is our town's history, our memories, and with any luck, our future, too. Y'all may not know this, but my career is at a bit of a fork in the road, kind of like Baxter Mountain, and just like Baxter Mountain, I am not going to change. So, for those of you who like my music, I've got a new one for you tonight. Just remember it's a work in progress, as am I. We're all walking on a timeline Towards the horizon for a good life But I never seem to get there Could you give me an answer Give me an answer Should I pay more attention to the simple things Should I focus on the meaning There's so many possibilities There's never one answer Never one answer I want to live fearless I want to do this, with feeling, feeling I want to jump into the ocean I want to fall in love with who I am, who I am And as the past falls far behind me I might need a hand to guide me out Out I want to live fearless I want to do this with feelin', feelin' I want to jump into the ocean I want to fall in love with who I am, who I am And as the past falls far behind me I might need a hand to guide me out Out We're all walking on a tightrope Laney! You're crushing it, Laney! All right, who's ready to kick it up a notch? Y'all ready for a Christmas song? Yeah? All right. If you know this one, sing along. Come on, Lori. I put it up in every room And I've been waiting here for you When you come walking through that door You won't wonder anymore if I've been dreaming about you There's mistletoe everywhere It's even hanging from the stairs There's something I've been trying to say But my fear got in the way And now it's time to make my move So c'mon let's kiss this Christmas You're all that's on my list this Christmas Get wrapped up in my lips I've been waiting for this Merry Christmas, let's kiss You put it up in every room It's like the ceiling is in bloom There's not a single place to hide But baby, even if I tried I'd be lying to you Baby you know I come prepared So there's a secret I should share You think you caught me by surprise But here's my purse, tucked inside I brought some mistletoe too So c'mon, let's kiss this Christmas You're all that's on my list this Christmas Get wrapped up in my lips, I've been waiting for this Merry Christmas, let's kiss Merry Christmas, Baxter Mountain! Merry Christmas! I put it up in every room And I've been waiting here for you When you come walking through that door You won't wonder any more if I've been dreaming about you So c'mon let's kiss this Christmas You're all that's on my list This Christmas Get wrapped up in my lips I've been waiting for this, Merry Christmas, Let's kiss
