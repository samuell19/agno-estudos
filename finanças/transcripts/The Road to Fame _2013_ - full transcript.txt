We need light here. Thanks. I remember one time in rehearsal, I was on stage during the lighting test. The stage was completely dark, except for a spotlight. I stepped in to see how it feels. And as soon as I walked in I was overwhelmed! From now on, I got three things to worry about Me Myself and I One day you're gonna see my name up in the spotlight. Carmen Diaz. Sparkle, girl! Sparkle. Eight o'clock Beijing time. Beijing's air today is hazardous? I noticed on my way to work Smog is worse in city center Smog is worse in city center. With 6 million college seniors, and 4.8 million unemployed recent grads, a total of 10 million are job searching? One two one? Attention! I watched George Michael perform on American Idol. He had that presence on stage, like his own universe. You can tell immediately he's A list. Definitely. I want to be like that - when I'm on stage, people go like this. Not the time for clapping yet. Already so crazy on the first day. A bunch of fans! The American teacher is arriving soon. This show is the first collaboration between Broadway and China. The task is very demanding. So let's give it our best. She asked if we sang that song. I said yes "Why does it sound so awful?" I said perhaps you are not used to Western music yet. This show is our? graduation showcase. And it also mirrors our life. Doing this show is very meaningful. It brings closure to our college life. The People's Republic was founded in 1949. So was the Central Academy of Drama. Chairman Mao highly regarded arts and culture. So he personally inscribed "Central Academy of Drama." When I first visited our campus, I felt it was a holy temple. Inside I saw our Hall of Fame. It displayed photos of many famous alumni. I decided then to follow their paths. Many compare the Academy to? the Fame school in the musical. They believe once you get in here, you will become famous. During the entrance exam, I was stressed for the first time in my life. I rarely felt stressed growing up But I heard over ten thousand were applying. I felt I had no chance. How could I get in? Pray pray pray I pray I make P.A. (Performing Arts School) I forced him to learn piano. At the beginning, it was? a test of our patience. After reaching level 5, he refused to play. "Ma, I don't want to play." "Ma, I won't play no more." I wouldn't allow it So I beat him with a bamboo stick. To what extent? He couldn't even bend his fingers anymore! But I still insisted that he play the piano. I pray I make it... She joined the army at 15. I thought it was good for her. I sent her there for security. She'd get married when she's older That's what parents want Those 3 years in the army, I think, It was no different from jail time. I wouldn't allow her to leave the army. She told me, if I insisted, She'd kill herself. She insisted on going to the Academy. I made it, I made it, I made it! When I got accepted, my dad was ecstatic. He invited everyone to a huge banquet. Liu Zhen Fei? ?is a true pride to his parents. Let's give him our best wishes. You must seize the opportunity and work hard. The entire Liu clan? awaits your glory! In our clan, he's the only college student in his generation. I made up my mind back then - I was willing to go broke to provide for his education. Everyone has dreams when they are young. I grew up in the countryside during the Cultural Revolution. Many dreams were beyond my reach. Kids today cannot imagine how terrible it was back then. No hope of getting into college. Back then, if you weren't from the city, you couldn't even apply for a technician job. The only option was to join the army. By sending him to school, I am having him fulfill my dreams. I don't expect much for myself, but I hope my parents can? In front of their friends and relatives? I hope to bring them honor. It's all about that. Hold still! Step back. Understood? Form a triangle. One two three. Still! Those on the side pay attention. Please stop talking Fei, if you continue like this, I'll kick you out. Quiet! Everyone Listen I can't stand you guys. Is everything clear? When do you say "Fame"? You guys dilly-dally all the time. When will you get serious? If anyone disrupts order again, I won't be nice. I'll beat you up! They are about to graduate. The truth is? the government no longer guarantees employment, so everyone feels insecure, which manifests as restlessness. A friend once told me, "Girl, better get famous fast." Once you reach 27, there'll be many 18 and 21 year olds competing with you. They don't understand? this is a good show, a very good opportunity to find jobs. They are like my own kids. Sometimes you need to kick them in the butt. Sometimes you gotta scold them. But ultimately, get them on the stage. My goal is to get everyone on stage. Those of us born in the 80s, we'll filter whatever you tell us. We understand that you mean well. But we'll still do what we think is right for us. I'm not into plays, or musicals. No passion for them. To be more realistic there's no future in theater in China. No money to be made there. We don?t want to graduate into the darkness of reality Since the future is bleak I'd rather argue with teachers at school It's better this way, better not to worry Even if you disagree, Mr. Know-it-all It?s really tough out there, ?cause I've been to many auditions. Do you know how they store actors' resumes? Huge sacks. Several of them. Who can manage to review them all? They take only one glance, Then your resume ends in a huge sack. Come. Fall in. But they will work hard, very very hard. He does. What do you want to do when you graduate? Either a singer or an actor. I want you to tell me, describe your personality in one word. I got it! Musical actor He lets you experiment. He'll keep it if it's good. If I were to choose? I'd go to America. Hollywood, or Broadway. Go steal their jobs. I think foreigners think more freely. I like that feeling of being free. I came from a simple, unsophisticated family. My mom's dream is to live with me in the future. But I want to go abroad. I want adventure. What she says really pains me. Because I have my own plans. I dare not tell her because I don't want to hurt her feelings. She doesn't like to talk to us. She's always like "I know what to do with my future." She doesn't want to worry us. -Or maybe she plans to join a troupe? It's like this Suddenly one day your parents no longer understand you. She keeps on saying that life is great, people can trust each other completely. She'll say, "Why do you always think? it's all great overseas? What's wrong with China?" Obviously we can't communicate anymore. Actually we don't? dream of her becoming famous. We just wish her an easy and secure life. Plan B? We've discussed Plan B. If you come home, we'll feed you. Once we die, you'll starve to death. If his dad stops working? We'd collapse. -No income. I make a few hundred a month. Our pensions are too insignificant. We still have to pay all his expenses. Let's see when you can start supporting the family? Oh, tell me sweetie Why are you drifting away? In freshman year a talent show called Super Boy its director called me and asked me to attend My parents said no, and that I should focus on studies. If we had let him go, perhaps he'd be famous by now. He's gonna be a pop star. If he had money behind him, he'd be the next big thing in this country. Hands down, hands down. Tell me sweetie, Are you also waiting for that day to come? Show business is? way too competitive. You need to have connection. We live here in Yichang. We don't have any relatives in Beijing. He has to fight for himself. This business is very difficult for people like me who have no connections. But my dream is to sing. I know some singers in Beijing. They live in basements And they are very poor. They tell me Most likely you'll end up with no money, and singing in small bars for pennies. They told me to be prepared. Right now I can't imagine what that life could be like. I can't imagine it. They are all the only child in their families. Parents and four grandparents? Six pairs of eyes on only one child. So they are? very very spoiled. It'd be nice if we could embarrass them a little today. Number 23 Stand up, Chen Lei. Come here. Number 17 Number 20 It feels like heaven on earth. I'm simply too? Really nervous. It's the first time I got chosen because of my singing. I just feel so, so? Crazy, made me crazy. You all really moved me today. I? I don't know how to say it. Just say it. Let's put it this way. We are all actors, aren't we? We were cheated! -Could it be?? Our job is to make believe, right? -Yes. Could it be?? We have just experienced what it's like to make believe. Remember how you felt. I got it! What a surprise! We didn't have a clue! Many will call me stupid for not having a Plan B. But if I? have a chance to go abroad, I will give my utmost to be the best. This? An English grammar book. Which role do you want? Whoever. I can offer you Shlomo. Greetings, teacher. Many recruiters will come watch your graduation showcase. Recruiters from all over the world China, the US, Japan, and South Korea. They are all watching you. So let's power through this together. Yeah! We're going to present to you a work-in-progress. Believing in this life, actors can make? I want to make miracle I want to be bigger than I am I want to make people really care That role belongs to me. Nick, according to the script, is rather good looking. I'm somewhat similar in that way. I want to make miracle I want to be bigger than I am I want to make people really care Playing Nick should be way out of my reach. I think I can't play this role. That's for the super handsome. Miracle Screw you, Iris. you and that silver spoon you keep shovin' down my throat. Don't need no rich bitch to tell me Which fork to use, I paid my dues In a rat trap building called New York Living off greens, beans, and pork In a basement, tenement No one understands this kind of discrimination This black skin, it comes this way Can't wash it off, it never fades So here is my blackness It's who you're until you're dead Now ain't that a kick upside the head? Our teachers don't believe I could play Tyrone. They don't think I work hard enough. Jasper argued with them. His confidence makes me feel I can do so much better! Because he already encouraged me when I wasn't trying hard From now on, I got three things to worry about Me Myself and I To get Carmen? I am confident. She is a better singer. But I am a better storyteller. She has a wild side, just like foreigners. Sometimes I'm not open enough. (No confidence?) I'm still searching. Voy allegar a volar, a volar Estrella en todo'el cielo Mira, Mira, Quiero brillar All of us are truly grateful to you. I want to be in the A cast. I don't want to be a B or C cast. Jasper said, "I'd never bet on anything. "But this one time I bet on you." Everybody laughed. I said, ?I won't let you down.? I'm actually working with someone from Broadway? And he thinks I am pretty good? Before we'd only find on CD covers- "B-R-O-A-D-W-A-Y." And on TV - "Broadway". Broadcast: The housing market is recovering? Average annual income for Beijing residents has increased by 12.17% This is my new home. I might find a designer to improve it. Put a bar here. Here, I will? set up a wine cabinet because I like collecting wine. I want to turn this into a closet. I buy tons of clothes of different styles. From luxury brands like Dior, all to way to? Adidas, I wear them all. This place? brings me the most pride. I keep my shoes here. I haven't found the right shoe cabinet. I have an obsession for shoes. I have as many shoes stored elsewhere. Compared to her classmates, our family is perhaps the poorest. She's told us how her classmates spend money. We are simply no match. They spend thousands on a purse. I've told her to rely on herself Don't wait for some rich guy. That'd be the worst. I'd be lying if I say I've never thought about it. How do I put it. Honestly, it'd be best to find someone who can help. After all, it's very hard struggling by yourself. After the army, I was assigned to the forestry department. Later due to financial difficulties, I resigned to work in logging and construction. In '92, I started making furniture. That little income paid for Fei's education. We had nothing else. Everyday I worked from 4am to 10pm. All these years of hard work caused me spinal problems. I had to quit. So I bought this van. Now we collect and ship mountain-grown vegetables. Deliver wild vegetables. I've been paying all my tuition and living expenses. for two years now, since sophomore year. I made my first killing in stocks. I bought Taishan Petro, at about 8.5 per share. Film a commercial? Tutor a student? Through friends and connections? get others jobs or into schools. This is my poem titled "Hope". "It's been one year since Fei left for school." "Parents stay busy at home with no break." "Success for my son requires money." "Only after bitterness and hardship, doth the sweetness taste sweetest." China's single children are slow in leaving their nests? This problem is? caused by our culture, ethics and family structure. You in the back. You go first. Put down the cell phone! Come on. Get ready! Come on. Get ready! I don't mean to bring it up, but? Some of you "proudly" skipped our Friday choral practice. Some "luckily" got sick this morning. If you keep acting this way sorry but you are out. Some of us are anxious, aren't we? Perhaps there's a dubbing gig, or an audition for a minor role, to prepare for your future. Let me tell you, that would be stupid. I got into the Academy in '87. While still in school I was offered to stay and teach. As graduation approached, many studios approached me and offered me roles. The main reason was? I started practicing martial arts at an early age. I had a solid foundation. So for martial arts films, I didn't need stunt doubles. Because of this, I was really tempted. I thought being an actor would bring fame faster. Everyone admires you and looks up to you. It really strokes your ego. Alas, for almost two years I was torn. But back then we cared more about serving society. I should give back to the society. Money and fame were not the first priority. But most kids today? care about material comfort too early. They don't care about pursuing? a belief or a noble career and fight for that dream Everyone, enjoy yourself. Drink up! Teachers think if we do well at school, we'll have a great future. But the real world works differently. They think gold will glitter eventually. But of the 300,000 actors in Beijing, how many have glittered? If your family has connections, if your father knows the investor, if he knows the producer then the role is yours. A lot depends on opportunity. on?how to create one when there's none. This is China's reality. China is a society built on connections. The Air Force Arts Troupe is very well-known. Who knows people there? For Zhang Xiao to find work I need to do my part At least create the environment? to get people to know him. I think he should pursue singing first and then acting. If you loan me money. I'll go try. /How much? How much? /200,000 When can you pay me back? Forget 200,000. I'd even loan you 2 million. Speechless now, right? Speechless? He's speechless. I know she can actually loan me that much. That's my parents' money, not mine. I'll make my own money some day. But I don't know yet what to do after graduation. That's what everyone talks about - - what to do in the future. Everyone is anxious. Today, some heard I'm applying to the Air Force Arts Troupe. So they asked if I've found any connections. If getting there really costs more than 500,000, I'd rather have my family give that money to me. So I can start my own production studio. That'd be better spent. Taotao, come here. I started my business before marriage. So I'll never let her do business. I must make enough for her to spend. Because I really really love the arts. Ever since I was a kid. And I wanted to pursue this career. But my parents didn't allow me to pursue the arts. Now finally I have my own kid. I love having a girl. She must do arts. I'm very clear on what I need to work on. Practice street dance and break dance. Find me some black swagger. Tyrone lacks self confidence, but acts all tough. He feels as a black man in America, he has no social standing. But I don't look down on myself. I feel great as a yellow man. Originally Jasper considered me the top candidate. But Hongmei moved me to second choice. Whatever. The A cast will be picked by the Americans. I believe I can get into the A cast. Let's assemble. I feel so relieved right now. The 8 from the A cast stay. The director wants to discuss characters with you. To see your understanding of the characters. Somehow we just ended up in the B cast! You feel like - Why? Or like - based on what? Very depressed. (Why are you depressed?) Dunno. Suddenly feel very depressed. So there's no chance for us to audition? and the A-cast is set? Wu Heng's looks and vocal skills? did make him a good fit for Nick initially. But he is uptight on stage. I have no comment on Zhang Xiao's character. But professionally, I think Zhang Xiao is good. Indeed he's not as handsome as Wu Heng. But who says only the handsome can act? His stage presence is better, right? Do you agree? You think you are a better singer. But some songs he sings better, no? Do you agree? Do you agree in some areas he's better? Do you admit his family background is better? Only the A cast rehearses. The director will give the B cast chances to practice. But we rehearse the A cast first. The fact is - regardless how hard you try, the results will be the same. Suddenly I'm very lost. I've never had my own interests since I was little. I didn't ask to learn dancing at first. My family forced me into it. Now, I've finally started to enjoy acting. All I want is to contribute to this show. I pray I make P.A. School is not an innocent place. Many other complications. Even if you have the skills, and you fit the role. you still may not get a chance. In 9th grade, I applied to a music school. That experience made me aware of "under-the-table" deals. Yes I'm still young, but I've had others step all over me. In the past, I could ignore all that. But this Fame show? is forcing me to bear with it. The real world is even more complicated. Sometimes there's too much pressure. I feel this is too difficult. Sometimes I encourage Fei. Sometimes I try to whip him into shape. Sometimes I give him severe warnings. "Wind doesn't always lead to rain. " "Rain doesn't always precede thunder. " "Don't mistake your possessions as fortune. " "Don't mourn your loss as ruin. " "Peace and security are true happiness. " "Simply and solidly lead your life." I have lived with him for a year now. I cook three meals a day. Do his laundry everyday. How should I put it? My child is all I need. I just worry about their job search. Can they make a living doing musicals? Where is their future? Students now have many problems. First, the economy is getting much better. They don't worry about survival. Second, as the only child, they've been loved too much. Any setback will fluster them. But our generation is under so much pressure. Each family has only one of us. All hopes are on us. Yes, go straight ahead. (Why start renting an apartment?) Because? my boyfriend lives in Wuhan, so he comes and visits me. I thought he'd only come once a month. But now it's every week. His family business is in construction materials. When he was 17, he made 3 million in one deal. (He pays the rent?) Yes. I'm not making money yet. To be honest, we worry about her studying in Beijing. Our worry is pure and simple. Competition is fierce in this society. Plain simple worries, honestly. We worry she might stress herself out. That's the only thing. My boyfriend asked me to marry him. I didn't say anything. The truth is after graduation, we need to worry about survival. We need to make money to support ourselves. As grownups, we shouldn't rely on parents anymore. We should be financially independent. I like this color. No, no? Professor Hongmei, you don't know how ugly the costume is. No. You guys? Wearing that, I won't have confidence dancing onstage. So, Carmen, how was L.A.? Did you meet any movie stars? Oh sure. The town's crawling with them. And you can read the names of the dead ones on the pavement? up and down Hollywood boulevard. The streets really are paved with gold. I got a trip and a tan on a ticket that my agent sent me I have zero worries It's impossible to compete abroad now. No matter how hard you try in this life, our training here won't measure up to theirs. Though it's true what they say That it's only a dream And a dream is a wish you wish for yourself In L.A. your dream may come true I'm no longer na?ve to believe in fighting on my own. I'm now more realistic. Once you think things through, you know what to give up. In L.A. you can find yourself I know that somewhere up there the sky is blue So smile when they say it's only a dream Like this marriage proposal. I wonder if marriage truly is my best option after graduation? But now I see many classmates still don't know their future. So I think it's not bad to have a relationship first And then to pursue a career. In L.A. Your dreams will come true They just need to devote themselves. They are all very confident. They all think they deserve to be in the A cast. They're too confident. They don't know they still have a lot to work on. Professor Hongmei? -Fei's got a fever. Who? -Fei. Fei's got a fever? Ask him to go to the hospital. You should go. -No no, I'm fine. You are burning. My family has high expectations because I only tell them good news. They suffered a lot raising me. It was hard for them. I get sick easily and was very naughty. I trust you can power through this. Go to the hospital after rehearsal. Now let's power through this, ok? No problem. You'll be fine. Yeah, help the pathetic poor kid! Don't give me that tired-ass attitude, like you care. But I do care. You've been disrespectin' me since day one. I have been challenging you since day one. You want me to fail again? Go ahead. I'll pass in summer school, just like I did last time. How? By cheating? I told you, I don't cheat, old hag! Often when I'm tired, I feel living is a burden. When really depressed, I don't want to live. Dancing on the sidewalk? Dancing on the sidewalk? But, knowing my parents' sacrifices, I can't fail no matter what. I need to live well for them, to support them, to? My dad wants a grandson, at a minimum. Your feet were too loose. I think you were too nervous. The show was about to open. We still didn't know how many performances we'd get. So we went to see Professor Hongmei. She was leaving the theater to go home. The B-cast cornered her. We told her how we truly felt. Only then did we get our fair chance. People usually think? the B cast is inferior. I don't think it's always the case. Hurry, hurry! Friends and relatives ask me - What is a musical? I said, who knows. From what I heard, there's singing, dancing, and jumping. What exactly it is, I'm not clear either. Focus and you should be fine. Just don't get distracted. Can't wait to meet the audience! I've been giving them tough love. Because sometimes they're too inexperienced. They need struggle and emotional turmoil? in order to become great actors. But I don't have time to explain myself. Thank you, thank you. Good evening. Welcome to the Central Academy of Drama theater. I pray I make Performing Arts School When I hit the heights Hit the heights Put my names in lights Yes, I'm gonna put my name in lights, yeah! Show the world That I can make it By doing... Doing... By doing hard work By doing hard work Before I went to college, my dad said to me "I don't expect any honor." "Just don't bring me any shame." Hard work! But I won't settle easily. I don't want to live an anonymous life. Notorious or famous, one or the other. I'm gonna be famous! -Carmen! You know what your problem is? You want everything too fast. Instant fame. Unfortunately, that only happens in fairy tales. We have arrived At a moment in our lives When the future passes into our hands We will find out Are we really strong enough To fulfill what the future demands You can't control fate. You have to follow the flow. Steadily one step at a time. How high can he reach? We can't limit or command him. As long as he is happy, and moving forward. Bring on tomorrow Let it shine Like a sun coming up on a beautiful day it's yours and mine We can make a difference It's not too late Bring on tomorrow Everything seems to have happened too fast. We are confused about the future. Feeling confused? about how to pursue our dreams. But there is also hope. We can make a difference It's not too late Bring on tomorrow We can't wait! Bring on tomorrow We can't wait! No words can describe how I feel. It's been really difficult raising him. Our son really makes us proud! Now they are entering the real world. Let's see how they'll turn out. There will definitely be stars among them. This is a very popular K-pop group. We are trying something similar. Wow. I lost 40%. Since I'm doing this, I have to win. I might have talked myself into loving this job. into loving this process. Maybe I'm just deluding myself. Is this a theater too? So beautiful! How can our Asian faces? make it up there? By playing a big tree? Three years since graduation, I've tried everything - plays, musicals, TV and movies. I'd never thought the road would be so difficult. Sometimes you believe you'll make it. But other times you doubt yourself, and tell yourself to work even harder.
