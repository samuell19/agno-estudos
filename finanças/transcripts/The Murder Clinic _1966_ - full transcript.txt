THE MURDER CLINIC - I have to go - Just a little while longer. Doctor Vance won't like it if I'm late. He's precision personified. Heaven help you if you don't respect the rules or neglect the patients. I've had quite enough of doctor Vance and his patients. They're crazy now, and they'll always be crazy. I can't wait to get out of this damned house. I hate it. Is that so? Truth is, you like it here. You have everything you want. And you haven't lifted a finger to find another job. Isn't that so? I do it for you. I like you too much. - All the women like you. - Me? - I don't even look at them. - Liar. - Katie, you're still not ready? - I'm coming, Meg, just a minute. - Hurry up, I'm tired. - You're right, I'm on my way. - Wait for me downstairs. - It's always the same with you. I'll call you when I wake up. It's nine o'clock. It's time to sleep. Good night. "And, as she faced the crowd, Mary Stuart demonstrated her regal courage... "She knelt down and with great dignity placed her head on the block. "Her ladies in waiting bent their heads in prayer. "The executioner slowly raised the axe above her... "And for a moment it was poised in the air. "At the same time, the door to her cell opened... " You're off duty now, Mary. Yes, I understand, Jane, I understand... It doesn't matter, I'll stay a little while longer. I'm sorry, that's not possible. I'll see you tomorrow. Pleasant rest. I'm sorry, dear, but I have to go. You wouldn't want me to be discharged. They're very strict. Come on, Jane, be reasonable... I promise I'll be back first thing in the morning. We'll finish the story. Good night. I must ask you not to be too familiar with the patients. - But that poor girl is mute. - We don't make exceptions. Come. Mary, you'll sleep here for now. It will only be for two or three days... Just as soon as one of the other rooms becomes available. Beautiful, isn't it? Yes, but more than beautiful, I think it's strange. - Good night. - Good night. Walter, what are you doing here? - You frightened me. - I'm sorry, but... You still haven't learned to knock. What is it? You're right, doctor Vance, but I saw someone... I thought they came in here, but I must have been mistaken. You're getting old. Nobody came in here, my wife would have seen them. Of course, doctor Vance. - I'm so sorry. - Good night, Walter. - Don't worry, he didn't scare me. - I'm glad, Elizabeth. I'm going to bed. Do you want me to accompany you to your room? Thank you, I may have a weak heart but I can still walk. As you wish. Good night. Something wrong? Jane, the girl who was here... She left. There was nothing more I could do for her. But last night, when I left her... Some relatives came and collected her this morning at dawn. Anything else? - No, doctor. - It's my fault... I didn't tell Mary. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. It would be wise for our new nurse to meet the patients on this floor. Come. - I hope you'll like it here. - Thank you, I hope so too. ... And this is Mr. Burt's room. I didn't call him, he's asleep. He won't give you much to do, thank God. He sleeps all day. Mrs. Hurley, here's our new nurse. Good morning, my name's Mary. If you ever need me... This is my friend, my only friend. He's beautiful, isn't he? His fur is so soft. No, don't touch him! Shame on you. I warned you about this. No, please don't. I'll behave. I promise. They make too many concessions to the patients here. Stuffed cats, indeed. However, dr. Vance has achieved surprising results with his new method... It must be noted. Now I'll show you a very interesting case. He seems calm, but be careful... He can be very violent. Fred, this is Mary, the new nurse. Good morning. Pleased to meet you. It won't be so sad with you here. I can't offer you a seat, as one should... They're afraid I can use the furniture as a weapon against them... ... ?r myself. I'm quite sure you'll be well soon. Don't be afraid. There's someone up there. Someone who's waiting for me. The footsteps get heavier every day. One day they'll be so heavy the whole ceiling will cave in... And I'll be crushed! I want to go away! I want to go away! - A sedative, hurry. - Right away. Damn you, you're all against me! Damn you! Schizophrenia. ?he attacks are getting more and more frequent. Doctor Vance. Can I be of any help? Go back downstairs immediately. Where are you going? No one is allowed up here. Not even a pretty girl like you. Why did you come again? It's your fault. They can hear you everywhere. I'll ask you one more time, let us treat you. No, no... Get rid of that lamp, Robert. I don't want you to see me. I don't want anyone to see me, never again. I'm a doctor, I might be able to cure you. Go away... I said go away! And don't come back. Respect my sacrifice. Go away. Do you want to wear this for the rest of your life? I never wanted this. Don't forget that, Robert. Least of all you, don't forget that. You want to keep me tied to you. You're afraid I'll free myself from this nightmare. Would you prefer it if I killed myself? No, I'll never do that! Go away! Go away! Do we have to ride at night as well? Are you in such a hurry to get rid of me? Why do you care if I work there or not? Let me go away. Answer me, at least! I'm just doing my duty, beautiful. We've been travelling since morning... I'm tired. - When are we going to stop? - We're still a long way from the coast. You can rest all you like when we reach the castle. I don't just want to rest... But it's pointless, you're so cold-hearted. You're mistaken. I'm not as cold-hearted as you might think. Then let's stop at the next village, we can spend some time together. I'll be really good to you, you won't regret it. That's not a bad idea... But when we're on the ferry. Drop dead, idiot! I've got thick skin. This carriage is useless. Scared of the cold, beautiful? Come and give me a hand. And don't try to run away. Otherwise... Damn it! I'd like to get my hands on that man that sold me this! How do you feel? What happened? Where am I? Don't worry, you're in no danger. But how did you end up here? The carriage broke down, the horses went wild... The man accompanying me was trampled... It was horrible! It's a miracle I survived, I've been walking in the woods all night. Come on, you're safe now. - Are you injured? - No... Just a slight pain here, in my chest. Let me see. Don't worry, I'm a doctor. It doesn't look serious. Come on, you can lean on me. Thank you, sir. I don't know what I would have done without your help. That's better. - May I ask your name? - Vance, doctor Vance. No, I meant your first name. Robert. Mine is Giselle. Where are you taking me, Robert? My clinic is nearby, you can stay there if you like. - Until you're fully recovered. - You're very kind. - Good morning, doctor. - Good morning, Ivan. I can't say it's very hospitable... - It's an old house I had renovated. - I never look at houses... Only the people who live in them. And judging from you, I'm sure I'll enjoy staying here. I hope so. This way. May I? It must have cost a fortune. Through here. Elizabeth. - Allow me to introduce Giselle... - Dubranton. She's been in an accident, the coachman was killed... She lost her baggage, she doesn't have anything, I hope you will accept our humble hospitality, Mrs. Dubranton. Humble? You're too modest. You can wear some of my dresses for now. At least they won't get musty hanging in the closet. And I'm sure they'll look much better on you. - Doctor Vance. - Yes? - Mr. Burt is asking for you. - I'll be right there. Sheena, prepare a room for her, she'll be our guest for a few days. I'll take care of it immediately. Shall I give her Jane's old room? Yes, sure. Excuse me. Doctor... Thank you for everything. Don't worry about the dresses, I'll fix this one, it will be fine. No, my dear, my husband is right. My dresses are just getting musty. I imagine you'll want a nice hot bath. Ask Sheena for anything you need, and don't be shy. - We'll expect you for lunch. - Thank you very much. Please. ... and the bathroom's in here. It's quite an old house. Listen... - What's so special about this room? - Nothing that I know of. Why? I'm just wondering. Have you come for a cure? You don't look ill. I'm perfectly fine, Robert brought me here. You mean doctor Vance? That's right. Why did you bring her here? - Who? - That woman, this morning. I thought I already told you, I found her passed out in Ipswich forest. Ipswich? What were you doing down there? Do you expect me to recount every minute of my day to you? Send her away. I beg you. - I beg you, Robert. - For what reason? You can't go on seducing every woman that comes around here and then... And then, what? Go on. I asked you to go on. And then get rid of them. Do you realise what you're saying? You're accusing me of murder. Let's go away from here, I don't care what you've done... I already saved you once. Robert, I'll always be at your side. What happened in London was an accident... The court acquitted me. Sure, after I testified in your favour. But I lied for you, because I loved you. Laura fell! I didn't push her! - Why would I have? - I don't know... Perhaps she said no to you? Or the opposite? - But you were tired of her. - That's enough! You pushed her. I saw you, it was you... You tried to kill my sister. It's nine o'clock. So? It is the rule that all lights be turned off at nine o'clock. The patients must sleep. I'm not a patient, I'm a guest. I'm going to bed when I feel like it. And remember, tomorrow morning, I want breakfast... - What is that noise? - Noise? What noise? Good night. Stop! Fred! What are you doing? Don't you remember me? Don't you recognise me? I'm Mary. Mary, the new nurse. Come on, Fred, give me that piece of glass... Give it to me, Fred. Do as I say. I'm your friend. And I care about you. Don't be stubborn. Give it to me. Do as I say. What have I... What have I done? Don't think about it, it's over. Thank you, Mary. You were very brave. Giselle! Hurry, bring me some bandages. Luckily, it's nothing serious. Do you always let him wander around like that? It's the first time he's attacked anyone. He's had fits of insanity, but he's always been harmless. I'm sorry for what happened, and it won't happen again... I'll have him placed in a cell reserved for dangerous patients. Where? On the next floor? No, in the basement. Move! Come on! Kill me, Ivan, or let me kill myself. Move. I don't want to live any more. Kill me, Ivan. I beg you. If it was down to me... - Who told you to put him here? - Doctor Vance. I'm sorry, Fred. You're not afraid of me. You're not afraid I might... No, Fred, you're just sick. You must trust us. We'll cure you. You're saying that to comfort me... I'll never be cured. I can feel it. The attacks are getting more frequent, more violent. I know it would be better if I could cut my own throat. The anaesthetic is taking effect. It's asleep. Your scalpel, doctor, and the drip line is ready. - The skin for the transplant. - Yes, doctor. You're lucky, Wolf doesn't make friends easily. - He could've bitten you. - I know how to treat animals. And men. Tell me something, Ivan... Who is the doctor hiding on the floor above mine? I don't know. You don't know who, but you know he's hiding someone. I don't know anything. Ivan... If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. Well, Ivan? What have you decided? Doctor Vance would like to see you in his study. You surprise me, Mary... I thought you were only jealous of doctor Vance. What are you are you trying to insinuate? There's no need to get so heated, it's no crime to be in love. - I'm not in love with anyone. - You will be. You will be. It's done. You'll have to wash the skin grafts with the nutritive solution every six hours. Yes, doctor. It has to take hold this time. It must. Come in. - You asked for me? - Me? No. Mary said you were looking for me. You heard wrong, Ivan. Get back to work. I'm sorry. I can't continue living like this. I can't, Robert. Where are you going? What do you want? Leave me alone. Go away. - I'm sorry, but I... - Who are you? Why did you come here? Go away! She's coming round. Is this how you repay my hospitality? Snooping around everywhere. You act like you own this place. You'll leave tomorrow morning. Take care of it. - Certainly. - Doctor... I need to talk to you. Go ahead. - Privately, if you don't mind? - I don't see why? I do. And you'd do well to listen to me. Leave us alone for a moment. Please. Well, then? I think the scare I had deserves an explanation at least. Who is that monster, doctor Vance? Why all this secrecy? These things don't concern you. Prepare to leave. You won't get rid of me so easily, I know too much. But I'm not sure yet how much what I've seen is worth. A patient? Absolutely nothing. Enough of this nonsense. I don't think it's nonsense seeing as how it could send you to the gallows. What are you talking about? - Now you're interested. - What do you know? - Come on, tell me. - Careful, Robert... I'd be a difficult corpse. I won't let you bury me in a cave. You saw... You saw everything... How much do you want? There's no need to be so blunt... - I'm a lady. - Enough. Very well... Let's say... ?50,000. That's an enormous sum. Give me time to get it. Of course, dear. We have a lot of time ahead of us. It must be quite exciting to make love to a murderer. Robert! I'm warning you... No tricks. Because I expect a regular funeral. Elizabeth? Don't just stand there, out of my way. Can I help? Shall I call the doctor? Clear off. You can't blackmail anyone here. I see news travels fast. Luckily it's only a superficial wound. Take her back to her room, and be careful. Take my advice... Pack your bags and leave. Thanks, but it will take a lot more than that to frighten me. - It isn't serious, is it? - No, it's a light wound. It's the shock she's received that's worrying me. Who could it have been? I don't know. Has anyone checked to see if Fred... No, I don't think Fred had anything to do with it this time. We must let her rest now. Thank you, you can return to your rooms. Good night. - Good night, doctor. - Good night. Drink it. Drink it. Come in. - What is it? - I'm sorry, I need to talk to you. One moment, dear. What happened? - You look upset. - Giselle... ... in her room. It's horrible. I'll be right back. - I'm afraid it's time to call the police. - No, Mary. I must ask you not to speak to anyone of what you've seen here. Say nothing? Not tell anyone that this woman was killed... No one will come looking for Giselle because no one knew she was here. Promise me you won't tell anyone. Do you realise what you're asking of me? No, I can't do it. Yes, you can. Of course I understand that you must know my reason for asking you this. Come with me, I'll tell you everything. No one can hear us here. I've never told anyone what I'm going to tell you. I was still a student when... when I fell in love with Elizabeth. And so, as soon as I graduated... we got married. I had enough money, and a fine career ahead of me. I considered myself very fortunate. Not long after our wedding, Elizabeth invited her sister to stay with us. Her name was Laura. She arrived one clear Autumn morning... She was very beautiful. Exuberant. Full of life. Perhaps too much so. One day, we all went out together, Elizabeth, Laura, and I... To visit what was to have been my clinic. I wanted it to be the most modern and most advanced clinic in the county. It wasn't even complete and I was already proud of it. I insisted that my wife and Laura come along to see it. Work was going very well, I was really satisfied. In just a few months my dreams would be realised. Never had I wanted anything so much as that clinic. I explained to Elizabeth, and Laura who was next to me... Where the various departments would be... and what effect the clinic would have once it was built. And she died? She's the one who lives upstairs. She won't see or be seen by anyone. The lime ate away her flesh. It's monstrous. It's a horrible story. But I still don't understand why she wants to hide. They accused me of attempted murder. At the trial, one of the workmen said he saw me pushing Laura over the edge. I had put my hand on her shoulder just a moment before... I was acquitted because of insufficient evidence. But as a doctor I was ruined. So I came here to this godforsaken place to be forgotten. Now do you understand why I can't run the risk of seeing my name linked to a murder. You must believe me, Mary. I didn't kill Giselle, I'm no murderer. I believe you. But if no one informs the police, the culprit will go unpunished. Is that what you want? Doctor! Open the door! What is it? Fred's escaped from his cell, we can't find him anywhere. Take care of my wife, that man is dangerous. Lock the patients in their rooms and warn the other nurses. Then it was Fred who killed her. Don't worry, doctor, I won't tell anyone. - The doctor said you should stay in bed. - Nonsense, I'm fine. Even if my husband wants me to rest all the time. - I want to know what's happening? - Nothing... It's nothing serious, one of the patients left their room without permission... - And now they're looking for him. - That will be all, you can go. The doctor asked me to keep you company. Thank you, but I don't want to trouble you. No trouble at all. You seem to be a very nice girl. Please help me to the window. But what's a young, beautiful, girl like you doing in a dreadful place like this? - I was offered work... - Do you like it here? - Yes. - Only for the work? Of course. You don't like this subject, do you? Don't worry, I won't mention it again. Would you get my shawl, I feel a little cold today. Where is it? I believe it's in the cloakroom. Thank you, Mary. Don't scream, you'll frighten Elizabeth. It's Fred, he committed suicide. His death is a terrible thing but it does free us all of a dreadful suspicion... Any one of us could have been the murderer... Now, there is no doubt. The real culprit paid with his own life. The nightmare is over. - Have you found my shawl? - I'll bring it to her... Call Ivan. No, go this way. - Good evening, everyone. - Good evening. What's wrong, Katie? - Aren't we friends any more? - You're late again, Ivan. Give it to me. Is this okay? I'm tired. I'll check all the rooms, then I'm going to bed. Alright. - Good night. - Good night. She was a troublemaker. We're better off without her. Give it to me... Get some rest, I'll do the rounds. Thank you. - I'm sorry, I didn't see you. - I was just thinking about you... About the trust you've placed in me. No... don't leave. Please stay a little while longer. These past few days have been terrible... I'm exhausted. Don't abandon me, Mary, I need you. Why are you telling me this? Because this is how I feel. I can't hide it any longer, I must tell you... The joy, the tenderness I feel when you are near me. The certainty of my love. I too have a right to be happy, and so do you. No... you're forgetting Elizabeth. Forget her? How could I? Every day, the accusations, suspicions... The grave just gets deeper. After what happened to Laura, I can not look at her anymore. A nightmare that torments me all these years. Only you can save me, Mary. Help me. Robert! Excuse me. Wait! - Have you seen my wife? - No. Look for her. Have everyone look for her. - What are you doing here? - Nothing... I came to have a look at the guinea-pig. To see the guinea-pig? It worked! The transplant worked! Away... Go away. Let's go up there, towards the garden! - Have you seen her? - No. Have you found her? How is she? No, but I wanted to tell you that the transplant worked. My God, then perhaps... But first we must find my wife. - She must be in the park. - Search everywhere. Don't move! Whoever you are, I also have a weapon! Stop, Elizabeth. Aren't you tired of killing? You wanted them to think it was Robert... Me... But you slipped up, the game is over now. I understood everything the other night, when you cut yourself with that razor... You are the murderer, and I was your first victim... - It was you who pushed me. - That's not true! - You cut the rope. - That's not true! You're lying, Elizabeth. It's not true! It's not true! Finally, you have brought it to an end... It was Elizabeth. Elizabeth! I saw her! She is over there! There she is! Elizabeth! No! You weren't responsible for Laura's accident... It was me, Robert. I was so jealous of her. And the others. I killed them because they were young and beautiful. I didn't want to lose you. I loved you. I couldn't live without you. Poor Elizabeth. I loved you too.
