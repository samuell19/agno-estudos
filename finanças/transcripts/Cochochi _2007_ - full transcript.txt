Here Evaristo! Angel! Hit him, Tony! The teacher's coming! Evaristo! Your brother can't play! Don't chicken out, Tony! Chicken! I'll play you a game, Nacho. They're waiting for me at home. Just one. All right, just one. Can I go with you on the donkey? Let's go. Don't you have to be at school, Tony? I don't want to sleep there tonight. Tomorrow is graduation. Get out of here. Evaristo kicked us out. We are about to begin... ...the graduation ceremony... ...of the 6th grade children, who will leave this school today. Next... ...we'll present the color guard... ...to honor our flag. Escort... Attention... Now! Everybody... Salute... Now! Do you want to go to the party, Tony? I just want to have a look. Do you miss your girlfriends? Not true. Evaristo Lerma Torres. Maria Guadalupe Armendariz. And finally, Luis Antonio Lerma Torres. Let's hear a big applause for them. Now I am going to announce... ...the winners of three scholarships for high school. In the first place we have Maria Guadalupe Armendariz. Let's hear it for her. Jose Angel Torres Rodriguez. Luis Antonio Lerma Torres. Let's see... Where's... - Where's Tony? - Luis... Antonio Lerma Torres? Please come up and get your scholarship. Does anybody see him? Come and get your scholarship. Where's your brother? Who knows? You don't know where he is right now? Why didn't he come? I don't know. Here, give him this. A round of applause for them. To conclude this ceremony, I would specially like to address... ...the sixth graders who will leave this school today. I would like to tell you... ...that you are giving one more step today. You will now go to another school... ...a high school... ...where you will have to adapt to a different discipline... ...from the one you've had until today at this school. I'd like to tell you that... you'll be the ones responsible... ...for education in the Sierra in the upcoming years. I'd like you to understand... ...that in the future... ...it will be you in the classrooms... ...doing what we do today. And we'll be very proud, all the teachers... ...and the community, if the day comes... ...when you get to be... ...professional teachers at this school. Thank you very much. Now the indian governor of the community... ...will give some advice to the graduates. Hello, good morning. Three students have won a scholarship... ...to continue studying. I am very proud to see how many of you have graduated... ...from elementary school. I hope you all find the way... ...to continue your education. Here comes Evaristo. It's him. I don't understand why he likes school so much. You forgot your backpack, Tony. Nacho, watch what I'll do with school now. Are those sheep yours, Nacho? Some, the rest are my mother's. Don't you get bored looking after them? I'm tired of this bike. I prefer a horse or a donkey. They're good for working. Don't be silly, a horse can strangle itself. How does a horse strangle itself? My grandfather once told me... ...about this horse he had, a nice one that he won in a bet. It was really well tamed. One night it was raining a lot, he left it tied to a tree. The next morning, it was dead. He must have tied it by the neck. He should have tied it by the legs. I hope grandpa gives us a good animal to work with. I don't know how to work. Transmitting the Voice of the Tarahumara Sierra, XETAR. With one thousand watts of power, at 870 AM. From Wachochi, Chihuahua, M?xico. XETAR brings you the Sierra Messenger. It's eleven thirty four. And now, the Sierra Messenger for today Thursday. Let's start with a message for Crist?bal Nevarez at the Okochochi ranch, ejido San Ignacio de Arareko. We need medicine from town. Please bring it to the canyon. Message from Juan Nevarez. Is Tony around? - Come with me to the canyon. - What for? To take some medicine to grandfather's brother. I don't know. It's really far. Are we going on horseback? I don't think so. They're using it to work. I don't think grandpa will lend us his. Come on Tony, tell me. How would we go then? Hitching rides on the trucks... ...or walking. If we go on the horse, I'll go. Why do you think grandpa will lend you the horse? It's a long way. - What are you doing, big head? - Nothing. What's Tony doing? He wants to ride a horse. Don't you? Grandpa won't let us borrow it. Quick! Let's tell grandpa. I'm coming. Don't you want to borrow my donkey? She won't make it there. She's too skinny. Come here. You're going to the canyon to deliver some medicine... ...to my brother and his wife Manuela. At the canyon. Do you know how to get there? No. You really don't know? I know a way. Which one? Through the valley of the erect penises, and from there to the waterfall to get to the sawmill. It's all right by the waterfall. But don't go around in circles, I get dizzy. Can we take a horse? Why would you want a horse? Here. Take good care of the medicine. Don't waste time. I told you he wasn't going to lend you a horse. What if we never get there? Are these the erect penises? I don't think this is the way. Now what? I thought you knew. Of course I know. Which way is it then? It's down that way. I don't think you really know. The horse doesn't like it here. Doesn't seem like it. There's no way through here. We have to go back. Let's walk then. I don't want to go. Hold this. Watch after the horse. I don't have to watch after this horse. Then tie it and let's go find a path. Don't tell me what to do. Evaristo! Come see this! What for? We can go down. There's some guys there. I don't like to get too close. Don't be a coward. They can tell us which way to go. I don't want to go down. Then go watch after the horse. Go, hurry! Hi. - Look, it's Luis. - Evaristo, be quiet. He'll hear you. They say he stole Chilo's sheep. Chilo told me he saw him. Let's hurry, you left the horse alone. Look, it's Angel. I see. You still want to go ask him how to get to the canyon? Go find out. I'll wait for you up there. I'm going to watch the horse. All right. Angel! Do you know the way to the canyon? I can't hear you! What are you doing here? I'm going to the canyon. Who are you going with? Where's Tony? Tell him to come! I don't know where he is. Tell me the way to the canyon. This isn't the way. Which way is it then? Aren't you going to tell me? We don't know. Tony! What's going on? Where did Luis go? He stole my horse! Are you looking for trouble? Get out of here! I think he wants to fight! The horse isn't around here. I think it was stolen. What are we going to tell grandpa? Let's keep going. We'll find it. We can't go back without it. The horse can't be too far. If you say he's around here, it's because you didn't tie him well. I didn't even want to take the horse. We've been robbed. Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Hey sir! Mister! Have you seen a white horse? Haven't seen anything. And a boy like me? I told you, I haven't seen anything. Do you know how to get to the canyon? Come, hurry up. I am lost. You can catch a ride in a school nearby. I'm going to wait outside. Come back here. What's your name? Evaristo. Where do you come from? Okochochi. Where? San Ignacio. The women in San Ignacio are beautiful. I don't know. Do you have a girlfriend? I don't like girls. Look, I had a girl there. Let's take this bus. Open up. Is this bus yours? XETAR brings you the messages of the Sierra Messenger. This is a message for the community of Machogueachi. Everybody is invited to the race ball game. What are you thinking of? They've disappeared. ...will participate the runners Isidro Villalobos and Rogelio Palma. It's going to continue raining. ...the bets will be collected the day of the race. What are you doing? You look worried. I've been robbed. What was stolen? A horse. Look, there it is. That's not it, mine's white. I'll help you find it. I'm inviting people to my party. Do you want to come? Let me find my horse first. My name is Maria Rosa, today's my saint's day. At the party we'll ask if somebody's seen it. Don't worry... ...we'll find it. Don't be sad. I'll help you. Don't pay too much attention to the guy in the truck. Hey Maria Rosa! - Celebrating? - Yes. - I'm collecting bets for the race. - Oh really? - What are you going to bet? - I'm looking for a horse. Let's go drink at my place. They prepared teshuino. All right. And you kid! Don't you want to bet anything? Do you want a ride? I'll take you home. There I'll find more people to collect their bets. So we go? I need to find my horse. Come on. My horse has to be found. You're not going to find it by yourself. - Hello. - Hi, come in. Have a seat. - Where do you come from? - Panalachi. That's far away. I'd like a cuba. Right away. That kids with you? Yes. Maestros, please play "Two Bottles of Mezcal". Evaristo, come here. Find the number of the radio station. Here it is. Dial it. Leave me alone. I'd like to leave a message... ...for Refugia in Panalachi. From Marcial Bernardino. It's been a long time since I left, I don't think I'm going back soon. Thank you. Let's go. It's over. I need to leave a message, too. Are you sure I'm going to get help here? Hi. Are you with them? Yes. All right. Very tasty, this teshuino. Oh yes. Very good. Go ahead. I'm going to try it. - Give me another one. - Of course. It will cheer you up. Then you tell me what we're going to do. Come here! Yes, come! He's looking for his horse. What color is your horse? Did you lose it or was it stolen? Was it stolen, or did you lose it? I think it was stolen. It was stolen? He says it was stolen. Have you seen it? I think my compadre ate it. Have you seen it? No, I haven't. Maybe this guy's sheep. I'll bet it tomorrow. Why not? - Is this for the ball race? - Yes. What's this guy going to bet? - We might win. Why not? - Well, or we might lose. But you can't be a sore loser. I'd like to bet a sheep. Then I'll have two! Where did you say you lost it? You won't find it. If it was stolen, they'll bet it. I saw a horse up the hill. - What color? - White. It could be this kids. Where did you see that horse? He saw it. What do we get? Do you have money? To trade for your horse. No. They saw it that way. - What color did you say it was? - White. White? What color was the one you saw? Kind of grey. Now he says it was grey. It can't be that one. Did you come across any white people? You think a white person stole it? I'm not afraid of white people. White people? They're the ones you have to fear. They have bad habits. They want everything for themselves. There's the guy who stole my horse. Where? There. Which one is it? That one. I know him. Let's talk to him. - I don't want to. - Come on. What are you going to bet? At least your sandals. You're still looking for that horse? You're a womanizer! That's why you're always here! - Go away, nobody wants you here! - And this one? This boy says Luis stole his horse. Is it true you stole his horse? Is it true you stole his horse? Do you think I'm a thief? Who knows? I didn't steal his horse. I don't even know this kid. I don't know where he lost his horse. Don't be a liar. I believe him. Did you see him taking the horse? No. If you didn't see him, how can you blame him? Only he can say what he knows. We don't know anything. Better have a drink and talk. You might solve it that way. I don't drink. Finish the cup... ...and the problem is over. I'm going to bet my sheep. For these two, to see who wins. And you, what are you going to bet? You're staying here with us. Just for tonight. There's going to be some food. There's still plenty of teshuino. You liked it. Didn't you? Just a little. Just a little! The bets are closing up! The race is going to start! Don't be sore losers. See that the runners complete their laps. These are the rules of the Rarajipa, the ball race. Those who accompany the runners on horse should be very careful. Don't step on the runners, like last year. Watch... ...your head! Has anyone bet a horse? Only clothes. No animals this time. Only a couple of chicken. Haven't you thought of taking back another horse? Could be. A horse can't cost too much. We could work to buy one. Hi. Hi. Do you know where Manuela lives? Of course. Where do you come from? From San Ignacio. Are you one of Cristobal's? Yes. We were expecting you. Where do you come from? - What's he doing here? - He came from San Ignacio. I forgot you were coming. Do you feel sick? No. Your head is very warm. I'll give you a remedy. Lay him down. I'll heat some water. What's next, Tony? XETAR brings you the messages of the Sierra Messenger. It's eleven thirty six. This is a message from Marcial Bernardino. Hi. Are you going to the harvest as well? This message is for Tony from his brother. See you at noon... ...at the school in Gonogochi. If possible... ...please bring the horse. - Where's this truck going? - To Sisoguichi. - Is that close to Gonogochi? - Yes. - Can you give us a ride? - Yes, why not. Have you been to the harvest? Never. I want to go. Santiago always goes. How's work? It seems there's some. My brother says I'm going to find a girl there. That there's people from everywhere. And it's better to bring back one from far away. It's not that easy. See you, Tony. See you. Evaristo! Evaristo! Evaristo! Evaristo! Feeling better? You're looking at the pictures of my youth? My face was smooth. Now I'm old, my face is wrinkled. Breakfast is ready! Eat this tortilla. Eat slow so you heal quickly. We eat little by little. I have to go, I'm going to school. To Gonogochi. - Are you leaving already? - To Gonogochi. What are you going to do in Gonogochi? - I have to go there. - Do you study in that school? You need to be at school to learn. But the school in Gonogochi is closed. I have to go to that school. It's best to go to one that is open, so you learn more. Here's the medicine. Thank you very much. Finish your tortillas on the way. You didn't eat anything. Thanks, I'll be on my way now. This boy's in a hurry. We'll have to wish him luck. Good bye. Honey! Honey, come help me! Tony! You heard the message! Tony. I don't want to sleep in the woods. Let's go home. What are we going to tell grandpa? That his horse was stolen? Or that some white people... ...ran over him? We can tell him I don't know how to tie. Don't be sad. At school we didn't learn those things. It's best to say the horse got sick and we let him die. Look at these horses. Let's catch one. Let's go home. I don't want to go back without a horse. Why don't we go home? Come on, Evaristo. I'm hungry. Tony, why didn't you go to graduation? I don't like to waltz. Me neither. You know? That day you won a scholarship. I don't care. Tony. Don't fall asleep. Grandpa, the horse is very dirty... ...and Tony is bathing it in the creek. There's plenty of water and the horse is very happy. Tony's coming back later with the horse. Tony stayed in the canyon a few more days. Grandpa, sorry. I didn't tie the horse well. I'll work really hard to buy another one. Grandpa. I never agreed with Tony. But he didn't pay any attention to me. Tony's very stubborn. Hi. Hi. What's up? What happened to the horse you took? Maybe he ate it. He doesn't want to talk. Come here. You know it was wrong to take the horse. It's the best one we have. I was using it to work. Fortunately, this horse is very bright. It got back two days ago. Don't be sad. Take it back to its place. Let's say hi to Angel, he's with a girl. Good morning. My name is Antonio P?rez. I'm your new teacher. I'll take attendance to see who's here. Marta Guadalupe Gomez Espino. Here. Maria Guadalupe Armendariz Cruz. Here. Luis Antonio Lerma Torres. Luis Antonio Lerma Torres? Is he here? Here.
