You love Mireille, right? -What? -I said, you love her. -Are you crazy? -No. You love Mireille. I can tell that you love her. Yes, you love Mireille. -Oh, Mireille. -Me? Yes, you. You love Mireille. Yes, you do. I don't know where you got that from. From watching you. -You're spying on me? -No, I'm watching you. It's the same thing. No. What's the difference? It's not the same thing. You spy to find out something. Me, I'm just watching you. -To kill time. -Like I care. So? So what? Do you love her or not? You're crazy, buddy. You're crazy. In a way, you've already answered me. If it was a no, if you didn't love her… you would have answered. But you made a scene. I didn't make a scene! A very small scene. -But still a scene. -That's not true! And you keep doing it. Since you made a scene, you must find her attractive. Very attractive, even. -Very. -Please, stop. See? You're afraid of being exposed, you beg me to stop. No. You love Mireille, right? If it makes you happy. You see? Poor Sylvain. Please. I'll admit, she's cute. Anyway… Anyway, what? She's engaged. Engaged? Really? I don't know if she's really engaged, but she's always with him. -With who? -I don't know. A guy in a jacket, with black hair. -A guy with a brown Triumph? -Yeah, I think so. -That guy's an asshole. -I don't know. A total asshole. -Alphonse. -Hi, Mireille. -Do you know Jacques? -No. Jacques, this is Alphonse, a friend. -Hi, Mireille. -Hi, Sylvain. -Sylvain. -Pleased to meet you. Are you okay? Are you alone? No, as you can see. -Edwige isn't with you? -What? Edwige isn't with you? She's at her aunt's this weekend. You wanted to see her? Not particularly. I was just asking. Okay. Won't you sit down? No thanks, I'm leaving. It's noisy, right? Sorry? I said it's noisy. Yes, talking is impossible. People don't come here to talk. What did you say? I said, people don't come here to talk. What did he say? He said people don't talk here. You're a little pushy today, aren't you? No, not particularly. Have you seen Sylvain? This is Sylvain. This is Mireille. Say hello to her. I already did. That doesn't count, say hello. My God, he's so dumb. It's because of the music. And I'm tired. What did you do today? Nothing. That's what tires me the most. -What time is it? -What time is it? 11.25. Well… -I'll leave you to it. -Already? Yes, I've had enough. What are you doing tomorrow? I don't know. Do we have plans for tomorrow? I don't know. What do you want to do? I don't know. Okay, I see. Will you come here? Maybe, I don't know. You'll see. Okay, well, bye. Sylvain? -Are you leaving? -I've had enough. -You're going home? -No, Oscar's there. See you. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Sylvain. -Goodbye. Beer, please. It's too hot. Come in. Hello. You're soaking, you'll catch a cold. -Hi. -Hi. Do you mind? All that rain! It's almost summer and we haven't seen the sun yet. I'll dry it in my room. Oh, dear. He's not mean. It's not that, but… He's young. He has to enjoy life. Of course. -Is he nice to you? -He's a good boy. But… The life he's living… He's a real drifter. He isn't doing anything wrong. He's happy. He's having a good time. You shouldn't complain. I'm not complaining, I'm worried. It scares me. He's old enough to handle himself. And he is. And he's doing pretty well. Don't worry about it. I swear, if I was his age… -Coffee? -Don't get up. Feels good. -Have you seen the weather? -Not yet. But I can guess. There's no more summer. They say that, but in my day… It was different. How would you know? There was no atomic bomb, no man on the moon. No atomic bomb? -If you think that… -He's pulling your leg. I'm not senile yet. I never said you were. You wouldn't dare. I'm worn out. No wonder. You've been partying all night. Tell me about it. Stuck in a bar for five hours because of the rain. -Some party. -It's not much better. Are you hungry? No, thank you. I'm going to sleep now. Anyway… the day is ruined. Thank you. How about you? Thank you. -Shit, I'm getting hungry. -Help yourself. No, no bread. I'm sick of it. -Is there anything left from last night? -No. There's eggs if you want. I'll do it. May I? Edwige. How are you? I'm fine. What about you? I'm fine. Are you stocking up? Yes, as you can see. You don't have a cart? No, but I'm done. -I have everything I need. -Wait. Put it in mine, I don't have much to buy. Okay. Thank you. Potatoes. -I forgot the potatoes. -Where are they? Over there. So, you were looking for me? As always. Who told you? -Mireille. -You saw her? She said you asked after me on Saturday. Yes, I asked her where you were. I was in Namur. How was it at your aunt's? It was raining. Is she okay? My aunt? Yeah. I have everything I need. -I need to go that way. -Let's go. Let me. I've got everything. So what did Mireille do on Sunday? She went to the seaside. In the rain? Must've been nice. Jacques wanted to. Tell me… -Yes? -Who is this Jacques? What do you mean? Who is he, what does he do, where did he come from? He's an accountant. -Really? -Yes. -He's got a brown Triumph sports car. -Yes, I know. Wait, I'll grab my stuff. When is your birthday? -November 2nd, why? -I'll buy you a bag. I have one, but I never use it. I hate carrying empty bags around. Tell me… It looks serious for Mireille. What? Her and that guy. Are you interested? In a way, yes. In what way? Mireille is a friend, right? Is it serious or not? I don't know, it's hard to say. If that's the way it is… Not quite yet, but… it's not far from it. Really? Do you mind? Me? No. Well, maybe a bit. I don't care, but… It's her… Yes, I see. You know what I mean? Yes. That guy's a jerk. He's not so bad. He's not my type at all, but he's nice. And he's not bad. He's not bad, but he's stupid. Where are you going? I'm going home. -I'll help you, are you going home? -Yes. -Give me that. -No, take this. You're here. Yes. I had to go to the bank, so I took the earlier bus. Did it go well today? Yes. Matignon made a fuss about the balance sheet again. But I don't care. Again… He'll never understand. You know, we have a long way to go before that guy understands anything. How can you keep someone like that in a department? In my day, it never would have happened. Anyway, I got things straight again. I explained to him for the 20th time that I could not be held responsible in this case. I hope he understood this time. I discussed it with Ambrin at lunchtime and he agrees with us. It's obvious, it makes sense. I don't understand how anyone can be so stubborn, it's insane. How is Ambrin doing? Not too bad. He's due to retire next year. Already? Yes, he's been very weak since his heart attack. Really weak. Yes, I know. The last time I saw him, he didn't look good, he seemed a little depressed. It's mostly psychological, because he's recovered now. At his age, surviving a heart attack is a good sign. Look at Uncle Edward. What can I say? We all get older. Your turn will come too. How old is Ambrin? We must be the same age. We went to school together. He was a genius. Unbeatable at exams. It's sad to see that. He won't get much of a pension. He has some money put aside, inherited from his parents. It can't be much. I knew Ambrin's father well. He wasn't rich. He wasn't poor, but he was far from comfortable. Unless his wife was… But I don't know. As he says, a small pension is better than nothing at all. Yes. Obviously. Obviously. You can't disagree with that. If he can get by like that, then why not? He's well within his rights, it's legal. Of course. Anyway… What's on TV tonight? It's a Knockout. Hey! I watch your pop shows. Yes. I'm going to see Mom. Yes. Of course. Hi, Mom. There you are. Did you have a good day? Yes, very good. Except that Matignon made a fuss again. -About that balance sheet thing. -Again? Yes. He still hasn't understood. I thought it was fixed. Yes, it is. But not officially. And he's complaining. Your father told me you have nothing to blame yourself for. Of course, but what can I say? -People are like that. -Yes. You stood up for yourself? Of course. Believe me, I gave as good as I got. Good for you. You mustn't do badly by people, but you have to defend yourself. Of course. Justice is justice. You can't let people walk all over you when you're in the right. People will always try to take advantage, you're right. And they do it more and more. That's right. There's no limit anymore. That's the way it is. And in the end you… Yes? Damn it. I forgot what I was going to say. It's gone. Never mind. And is everything else okay? Yes, fine. Are you sure? I'm fine. Is something wrong? No. Are you sure? Yes. Why wouldn't I be okay? You can tell me anything. Yeah, I know, but… I'm fine. Okay, so everything's fine. I don't know why you thought I wasn't okay. It's nothing. You looked like something was wrong. You get feelings like that sometimes. You can be wrong. Yes. I'm always worried about you. You shouldn't be. I know, but… I can't help it. It's silly, isn't it? Of course not. You're still my little boy. I've grown up a bit. Yes, but that doesn't count for a mother. I know. Only mothers can understand that. It must be the same thing when you're a father. No, it's not the same. I'm not sure, but I don't think so. No, I doubt it. It can't be the same. A mother has… a way of… understanding… of feeling… of… I can't explain it to you, it's inexplicable. Maybe. You'll see what I mean. You'll understand when you have a wife. Yes. Get me the meat. -What? -The meat in the fridge. Right. Pass me the margarine. Here you go. Mom… Yes? I've… I've met… a young girl. And I'd like you to meet her. Mom. Mom, don't cry. I'm not crying. I'm not crying. Yes, you are. -You mustn't. -I know, it's stupid. No, it's not. But I can't help it. It's so unexpected. What's going on? Nothing. It's nothing. It's nothing, Mom. You're upset. It'll be alright. Just let yourself go. Just relax. What's going on? Is she crying? Yes, she's crying. Is something wrong? What's going on? It's nothing. It was so unexpected. Jacques… Jacques is engaged. Ah. But you shouldn't cry over that. I know, but… it's so unexpected. Come on, come on. Calm down. He'll think you're unhappy. Be sensible. Yes, I'm alright now. It's alright. But you understand, it was so unexpected. It's alright. So you're engaged? Well, not yet. But I'd like you to meet her. So we don't know her. She's a typist at the firm. A shorthand typist. -Is she a good girl? -Yes. -A decent girl? -Yes. -An honest girl? -Of course. Isn't that right, Mom? Is she nice? -What's her name? -Mireille. -How old is she? -Almost 20. Nineteen. I can't wait to meet her. You'll like her for sure. I don't doubt it. You always were sensible. I must cook my meat. Come on, let's set the table. I hope she's pretty. -Were you at the hairdresser? -No. It's "go to the hairdresser." That's right. "At the brothel and to the whores," as Alphonse would say. Alphonse! What? -Alphonse is nice. -Yes. So, what? Do I look okay? Yes, fine. Should I add some blusher? -No, why? -I'm not too pale? I don't think so. From up close, I can see you're tired. -But you look fine. -Is it okay? Yes, I think so. I'm so worked up. -Do you know his parents? -I've never met them. His father is an accountant, that's all I know. They have a Peugeot 404, but hardly ever use it. -And his mother? -He never talks about her. And now? Can you see dark circles under my eyes? A little bit. -But it's okay. -Are you sure? -Yes. -And you're sure I'm not too pale? No. Wouldn't I look better with a little blusher? No. It would be too much. And they'd notice that you're pale. I think so, anyway. Why don't you wear foundation? That would fix it. No, he says it's vulgar. Oh, dear. Yeah… What a mess, sweet Jesus. Yeah… So, you think I'm fine? Yes, you're fine. What time is it? Not five o'clock yet. -You have plenty of time. -But I feel so worked up! So, I look okay? You look fine. Well… Okay. Okay, take a look. What do you think? It's nice. -It's fine. -Fine? It's not bad. It's a beautiful dress. It's really not bad. But… But? It's very nice, pretty even. But you know… It's a bit severe, isn't it? You think so too, huh? Yeah. It's very pretty, but it's too serious. It would be perfect if you were five or six years older. It's too… Too… Too severe, that's the right word. That's what I think too. But that's why I bought it. Jacques will surely like it. He really likes stuff like this. I was sure that this was the right one. But not anymore. Not at all. Funny, isn't it? It's too… too severe, like you say. It ages me, you see. That's it. It makes me look old. I'm glad you feel the same as I do. It's not the one I need, right? I don't know, if Jacques likes it… Yes, he will like it. But that's not the problem. He'll probably like it, but… if I wear something else… he'll like it, too. I don't want to wear it anymore. At least not today. I don't want to wear this when I meet his parents for the first time. You know what I mean? It's weird, because when I saw it, I immediately thought it was exactly what I needed for the occasion. I don't know why. And now… Has Jacques seen it? No, I didn't even mention it. I wanted to surprise him. Should I still wear it? Well, I don't know, if you don't want to… Wait, I'll put it on, so you can see it better. So, what do you think? It's a really beautiful dress. It looks good on you. Yes, I tried it on, but I don't know. It looks serious, obviously. That's the problem. It's not suitable. It looks fine. But it's not the right thing. Don't you like it? Yes, I do, I think it's great. It's perfect. But not for a day like today. -What do you think? -You should wear something else. Yes, that would be better. -You think so too, right? -Yes, you'll be more comfortable. Yes, I think so too. It'll be better. Can you help me? Is that okay? Yes, thank you. You could wear the red one. No, I wore it last weekend. I have to get it cleaned. -How about this one? -It's too warm. And the flowery one? Yes, of course. It's pretty too. I thought of the blue one. Yes, of course, it suits you. Let's see. Can you hold this one? Yes, it's fine. It looks good. Yeah, right? I'm very happy with this one. I like it very much. I think it looks good on me. Yeah, it does. These little frills are nice. Yes. They're cute. It's really cute. How is it made? It's nice. It looks complicated to make. Maybe not. There must be a technique. It's machine-made, so it can't be complicated. You never know, all the stuff they can do nowadays. Yes, of course. In any case, it looks complicated. Yes, of course. I'll ask my mother if she knows how to do it. That's nice of you. -Will you let me know? -Yes. Let me see the other one. It's really nice, isn't it? What do you think of it? -Well… -Don't you like it? Yes, it was my suggestion. Yes, it's really nice. Give me the other one. They both suit me. Yes, they both look really nice on you. God, it's complicated. What about a skirt? Yeah, sure, you can do that too. No, I can't. I don't have a proper blouse. I can't. Do you think I lost weight? No. I must have lost weight, it used to fit better. Maybe a little bit, but it doesn't show. Maybe. You don't think I've lost weight? No. -You really don't? -No. Well… So, what should I wear? What's wrong? What happened? -Nothing. -Are you feeling okay? Yes. -But… -But what? But… Why are you sulking? -I'm sulking? -Yes, you are. I'm not sulking. You're not? So? -So I'm sick of it! -Sick of what? Of everything. Of everything. You wouldn't understand. -Yes, I can. Listen… -No. Well, this is fun. Is it… Did you dislike my parents? No. If so, you can tell me. I'm under no illusions about them. I told you, no. And besides, why? Why do you think that? Because it's not been the same since you met them. No… Your parents are fine. I mean, they're parents, right? Mine are no better. -What is it, then? -It's nothing. Yes, it is. Damn it! -Where are you going? -Leave me alone! Leave me alone, do you hear me? Leave me alone! Alone! Leave me alone! Are you deaf? -But… -Go away! -But, Mireille… -Stay away! Leave me alone! I'll drive you home. -No. -Don't be silly! Go away! As you wish. Come on, don't sulk. -It's becoming a habit. -What did you say? Nothing, you wouldn't understand. Don't sulk then. I'm not sulking. -Really? -Am I sulking? Well, yes, you are. -So I'm sulking. -Come on, calm down. Do you think I'm sulking too? No. You're just upset, that's all. Am I upset or am I sulking? No, you're not sulking. -So why do they say I'm sulking? -Well… They think you're sulking. Don't make a big deal of it. I'm not making a big deal. Smile, then. -More than that. -Don't start! I'm not doing anything. I'm just trying to cheer you up. Well, you're not. -I can see that. -Leave her alone. Look… -Stop that. She's upset. -I'm not doing anything! I'm just trying to get her to relax. Stop it! She's not going to sulk all night! -It's too much. -So I'm sulking? -He's messing with you. -Bye! Great job! Oh, come on. Bye! Listen… -You're not doing so good. -So? Nothing. I didn't want you to leave on your own. It would have ruined the evening. I might meet the man of my dreams tonight, you never know. Of course, they say that, but… Yeah. Where are you going? Nowhere. I don't want to go out, I'm going home. Shall we go to Pierrot's? No. I don't feel like it. I don't want to go anywhere. I don't know. -I just want to walk… -So let's walk. -You're going to ruin your night. -It's already ruined, so… -You can go back to the others. -That would be fun. With your ghost hovering over us. So, shall we walk? Let's walk. See… They won't come back. It's stupid. And all of a sudden, I saw him for what he was. Until then, I only knew part of him. But when he was with his parents, like that, in the apartment, I suddenly saw him in his entirety. Everything widened, like that, all of a sudden. It was like a wake-up call. And I thought, "No, it's impossible." Something broke inside me. I don't know, I can't explain. As if I'd become someone else, you know? Someone different. Or the opposite. As if I'd suddenly become myself again. As if before I had gradually become… someone else without realizing it. Then suddenly, it was over. That someone else was gone. Gone, disappeared. They no longer existed. And suddenly I was there instead, you see? I was all alone in front of them and I thought… "Sweet Jesus, what the hell am I doing here?" "I don't belong here." You see? Did you suddenly realize that you didn't love him? No, I mean… I don't know, it's hard to explain. I suddenly realized what it would be like to live with him. No, it's not even that. I already knew that. I knew him well enough. -I can't explain it, you know? -Yeah. Actually, it doesn't matter. It's over now. I didn't want to tell anybody. I was really upset, but now… -Do you feel better? -Yes. -I'm relieved. Funny, isn't it? -Yeah, it's funny. Was I really sulking? No. But I could see you were upset. -Was I annoying you? -No. We were annoyed because we couldn't help you. So I was annoying you. Yes, if you insist. You were annoying the hell out of us. You're sweet. Sure. Look who's here. Hi. -Hi. -Is this where you were? -Are you okay? -I'm feeling better. Can we sit down? Of course. What do you want? A beer. And you? Ma'am? Four beers, please. So? Are you still sulking? Was I sulking? -Yes, ma'am. -Sir, if I had known… -Are you feeling better? -Yes, it's over. -So, you're not sulking anymore? -No, I'm not. What a shame. You looked cute. -It's a real shame. -Too bad for you. And Sylvain helped you? Yes. That's surprising. -Sylvain is nice. -Yes, I know. He's very nice. He doesn't look like much, but… he's very nice. You're nice, Sylvain, aren't you? Didn't you know? No. Sylvain is… well… Sylvain is very nice. I'm surprised you didn't know that about him. -You can't know everything. -But you should have known that. How could… How could you live this long not knowing that Sylvain was nice? I don't know, but I did. Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. -How much is it? -One hundred francs. -It's on me. Service included? -Yes. Here you are. Cheers. Cheers. It's funny that we found you. Do you come here often? No, never. This is the first time. Have you been here before? No, never. It's my first time, too. That's funny. Funny. -Did you know this place? -What? Have you been here before? No, this is the first time. I didn't know it at all. -Why? -No reason, it's funny. I was thirsty. What's wrong? Nothing. Are you mad at me? No, it's over. And I started it. Yes, but it was stupid. I should have let you be. No, you were right. I was on edge. But now it's over. I should be thanking you. What can I say? Some days are like that. You know you should keep your mouth shut, but… you can't. -You can't help it. -I know. You're nice. No. Sylvain is the nice one. -Right, Sylvain? -What? You're nice. I'll stop now. I don't know what's going on, but… everything's upside down. There are days like that, when I can't help annoying everybody. No matter what I do or say, people start to grumble. It's crazy. No… I was annoying everybody earlier, that's why. It's not your fault. At least, it's not all your fault. No, but it's nasty. -Will you develop a complex? -No way. -But… -But what? Nothing. Don't you think it's a nasty day today? No, I don't think so. I did earlier, but now I feel fine. It's funny, when you feel nasty, the whole world feels nasty. Do you feel nasty? No. No, not so much. But it feels like everyone's nasty. Otherwise, I feel good. I even feel like I'm the only one who's not awful. Isn't that odd? You're funny. I don't think I'm funny, especially today. You're still funny. Why am I funny? I don't know, the way you see people, the way you look at things. It's not funny. Yes, it is. I don't find it funny. For you maybe not, but it's funny for other people. Well, I'm leaving. Really? Yes, I'm going home. As you wish. I'll go with you. I'm tired. Good night. -Good night. -Bye. -Tomorrow? -See you tomorrow. See? I'm annoying everyone today. No, you're not. They left because they were annoyed. I annoyed them. No, they weren't annoyed. They were annoyed, I swear. Do you want a drink? A beer. Hello. You weren't sleeping. -Yes, I was. -No, you weren't. I can tell. I can tell when a girl is pretending to sleep. Give me a kiss. Are you okay? I'm fine. And you? I'm fine. It's so nice to lie down and do nothing. Are you okay? Yes. The weather is nice. I'm glad. It's nice, isn't it? Hello? Are you sleeping? No, I'm thinking. About what? Lots of things. Are you sad? No. Look at me. -Are you okay? -Yes, I am. You don't look like you are. -It's nothing, you wouldn't understand. -Yes, I can. We were good together, right? I guess so. It seemed like it. -Yes, it was good. -It was? It's not over yet. Yes, of course. What do you mean, "of course"? Tell me. Do you love me? Yes. I love you. Yes, but really? What does it mean to really love? What's going on? I don't know. You're making life complicated for yourself. No, life is complicated. No, life is simple. But you're creating problems for yourself, instead of living your life. Enjoy the present, damn it. It won't last. I know it won't. I know, but it's not so easy. -Yes, it is. -No, it's not. It's easy, you just have to… Don't forget I'm a girl. -So? -It's not the same. -Yes, it is. -No, it's not. Yes, it is. Girls think we always do what we want. But we're in the same shit. In the same shit. You think that, but you're not. -Yes, we are. -No, you're not! You don't understand. I understand, you don't let yourself live. -Yes, I do! -No, you don't! That's the problem, broadly speaking. You can't let yourself live. To take what comes and not care about the future. You really don't understand. -It's not true? -No, it's not! Well, yes. To a certain extent. That's not the problem. You see… What? -What should I see? -I don't want to end up in a hospice. Or like my parents. I don't want to become a piece of trash. I'm not asking for much. I just want to have a decent life. And four or five years from now, I don't want to end up on the scrap heap. Look at all the older people we've known. Look at what they have become. Look at Liliane for example. She's not even 25 and she's already an old woman. She's completely screwed up. Do you want me to become like her? No, I don't want to. I'm not asking you to be like Fat Liliane. It's a pity about her, but… So I have to defend myself. -But there are other ways… -No! So what should we do? We get up? I'm off, see you tonight. Wait, we're coming. Hurry up, I have to go. Hello. Miss. Ma'am. Breakfast is ready, I'm off. Thank you. You'll be back late tonight? -About 6.30 or 7 p.m. -Okay, do you need anything? No, thanks. -How about you? No errands to run? -No, thanks. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, ma'am. Bye. -Let's eat, shall we? -No. But… it's all ready. The coffee will get cold. I'm not hungry, I'm leaving. Have a cup of coffee, at least. No thanks, I have to go home. As you wish. Goodbye. Goodbye. You know, I… Yes? Nothing. Goodbye. Goodbye. You know… I've decided to marry Jacques. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah. -You should have come to the wedding. -Yeah. It was great. We had a good time. It was really great. Mireille was beautiful. You can't imagine. Really? And he's actually quite cool. He looks like a jerk. But he's actually very nice. And he's not stupid. He's just different. He's… serious. Yeah, serious. It's because of his job. Working with numbers all day long. But after work, he's different. He's even very funny sometimes. Of course. And he's nice. I think they're well-suited. They'll get along well. -A real fairy tale. -Oh, come on. They got married and lived happily ever after, right? You can't be serious. You always have to make jokes. I'm not joking. It's a disaster. What's a disaster? Their marriage. Same again, please. Listen… I'm listening. Well… Edwige and I… We want you to be our witness. -You too… -Yes. -Because of Mireille's wedding? -No. -Listen… -No, we planned it before that. You did? You don't have to accept to please us. If it annoys you, say no. We won't be angry, we know you. But it would be great if you agreed. I'll do it. Thanks, that's nice. I have no reason to refuse. We were afraid. No need to be. -I like you both. -Thank you. You're welcome. When is it? We'd like to do it in early June. Before the holiday rush. For the honeymoon, you know? -Well, congratulations. -Don't mock us. I'm not. You don't have to worry. It'll be simple. Just the parents and us. Her sister will be the other witness, is that okay? Sure. Hi. Good morning. -Oscar isn't here? -No. He had to finish a project yesterday. Did you get back late? I don't know… Yes, probably. You drank like a fish again. No, not really. I wasn't feeling well. I was exhausted. Feels good. Eat something. I'm not hungry. I'm quitting my job, going away a while. You don't like it? Well… I just want to go away. But it's a good company. A good company… Do as you wish. Don't worry. When will you go? Not right away. After Sylvain's wedding. Where will you go? I don't know. I think I'll try Italy, but I'm not sure yet. You don't speak Italian. No, but… I should be able to manage. They must be used to it. If it doesn't work, I'll go back to the south. Mind you, I'm a little tired of the south. Especially in summer. It's full of people. They're building everywhere, screwing everything up. Anyway, I'll see. How long will you stay? I don't know. All winter, I hope. I'm sick of winters around here. It's grim. It's dirty, cold. -The weather's bad there too. -Less so than here. And it's warmer. I don't know. Italy is mountainous. A bit like Switzerland. Not everywhere. Do you remember Rosana? She was always talking about the snow. Damn, that's right. I forgot about that. Does it freeze there? Yes, surely it must. If there's snow, it must freeze. Otherwise, the snow would melt. Shit, what else? Remember that movie we saw… What was it called? Which one? An Italian movie with… Shit, I forgot. It's about a hairdresser who's in love with a seamstress. Remember? You know. Then it doesn't work. The girl runs away to Rome. They meet again, but she is married to… Shit. You know who I mean. He's mute, they try to blow him up with a bomb. Yes. So he's able to talk again and he enters a convent, right? -Yes. -I remember. And the title? I can't remember. Anyway, you know what I mean? There was snow at the beginning. Quite a lot, actually. The girl gets really cold in her mini-skirt. -Do you remember? -No. At the beginning, it's carnival, or a festival. I remember very well. I don't know, maybe. -And then it's in the snow. -Yes. What was it called? Anyway… They can fake it in the movies. -They do whatever they want. -Yeah. But they wouldn't fake that. -I don't know. -Why would they? I mean, it's expensive and… it's pointless. Yes, maybe. Don't forget to tell the insurance company this time. No, don't worry. I have money for rent too. That's not necessary. Yes, it is. You shouldn't have to go without just because I'm leaving. It's important to me, you know that. Will you write? I like to know where you are and what you are doing. I promise. Want some coffee?
