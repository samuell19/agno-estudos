hello, everyone! My name is caleb turner. I am the producer of "my favorite santa" and please, please all remember that the movie premier is next Friday, only on dazzle plus, so tell everybody you know. I am thrilled to introduce some extremely special people who want to come out here and answer some of your questions, so enough of me talking. Let's get right to it. First and foremost, the lovely and talented writer and director, jill turner. and now, please, let's say hello to our beautiful leading lady. The fabulous, mariah marquez. and last but certainly not least. You know him as the king of christmas movies, please give a warm welcome to the one, the only, brad baxter. okay. So, it is now question time. If you have anything you would like to ask, just raise your hand and we will call upon as many of you as we can. Right here. and yes, madam, you have a question? you don't have a question. Oh, thank you. This might be a silly first question, but I really loved all the costumes in this movie. They just jumped right off the screen. Is there any story behind those? No, wait, nancy devine, is that you? Guilty as charged. oh, my god. Put your hand down. Hi caleb. Well, um... that would actually be a question for our costume designer, also known as your daughter. Kerry, I see you there. Come on up here and say hello. Come on, everybody. Come on, get up here, kerry. Come on. Yeah. Alright. There you go. - Ugh! - Oooh! She's ok. She's ok. Ladies and gentlemen, kerry devine, our costumer extraordinaire. Thank you very much. There you go. - Oh! - Take that. Ok. The question is for you, kerry. And I'm sure that you must have quite the story to tell. Yeah. Well, actually for me it was all just a, uh, a happy accident. last November, "my favorite santa" was shot in my hometown of twelve oaks, colorado. It certainly changed the town and it definitely changed me. Little help from my assistant manager? Sorry, honey. I am so excited about this movie filming here I can hardly stand it. Mm, me? I can't stand it at all. Do you know how many people would give anything to have a big christmas movie filmed in their hometown? Not to mention one starring brad baxter. Which one is he again? He is only the king of christmas movies. "the christmas clock"? "hello, christmas"? - "chattanooga christmas"? - No. "there's no christmas like snow christmas"? kerry, you live with me, how come none of these movies even ring a bell? Well, they all sort of blend together. But, if you're happy, I'm happy. Well, you should be, because the entire cast and crew are staying right around the corner. This could mean a lot of new customers. I love you, mom, I do, but it will take a miracle for me to pay back all this back rent. Honey, I know it has been a rough patch but something will turn up. You'll see. Something just turned up. collection notice. look at this little cute town, huh? But where are all of my adoring fans, huh? On a Tuesday at noon? Unless they declared your arrival a state holiday, I'd say work, school and lunch. Ok, well um, a little fanfare would have been nice, you know? Get on twitter. Count your followers and that should tide you over. It's a good idea. Hey, hey, hey! There he is, my guy! I want to introduce you to mayor dennis lee. Because of his superb outreach and partnership, we are the first movie ever to shoot here in twelve oaks. - What? - Mayor, this is the brad baxter. Wow. What a pleasure, mr. Baxter. A superstar like yourself in our little town really puts us on the map. I can't thank you enough. Oh, please, call me brad. The mayor's really rolling out the red carpet for us on this one. How 'bout a couple photos? What about right here? - sure. - I can take a snap. - yep, let's do it. - alright. Here we go, here we go. And there we go. nice. - Ok. Let me see. - what? Yeah, I wanna check it out. oh, ok, yeah, yeah, check that out. Oooh, hm. I don't know. The mayor looks like a handsome devil but I look like I ate something sour so we're just gonna delete that one and take it again. Ok. Let's, let's try that again. Is that ok with you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, totally, yeah. Here we go. Ready, one, two, three. Cheese! let me see. ok, yeah, there you go. Ah, there it is. Huh? Look at us! I love it. Thank you. oh, wait a minute. What is this? Oh! I gotta take this. So, we're gonna do one of those. Oh, ok. And, uh, mayor, so great to meet you. Thank you for having us. I'll see you later? Yes. You too, brad. And we'll see you at the tree lighting ceremony tomorrow night? Yes, yep. Ok. Ok. Ok. We'll talk. Ok. Wait, what? Lucy, lucy? Hello? Are you there? aaargh! No. Oh, hi, excuse me. Hi, sorry. Hey. Uh, hey, can I borrow your phone for like two seconds? My phone died. I was on a really important phone call. - Uh.. - Hi.. - Uh, sure. - Great, thank you so much. I'll just... Thank you. I'll be quick. Ok. lucy, brad. Nah, no, sorry I ran out of juice. Anyways, just start over. Tell me again. what exactly was the offer? Ok, great. Well then, no, thank you, lucy and alright. We'll, uh, I can't wait to hear. We'll talk soon. Ok. Bye. Hey, hey, hey, hey! My phone? Can I have my phone back, please. Oh, I'm sorry. My head was still in that call. You know how it is when your agent calls. Throws you a curveball, just makes me crazy. Oh, by the way, you missed a few phone calls and like three texts, so. I'll see you around town, I hope? Wow. Mom? What is all of this? I was inspired by all the christmas spirit. What do you think? I... I think it's a little early for nancy's famous explosion of christmas decorations. It's not even thanksgiving. Oh, right. I forgot. I live with kerry killjoy. Mom, I need a plan for the store. I've got 60 days and counting. Oh, honey, about that. I have decided to dip into my savings and get you squared away on the rent. No, no. And then we can pay off some of the bills too. No. Mom, dad left you that money for your future. For your life. Honey, you are my life. Don't you think your father would have wanted me to help you out when you needed it? Well, yeah, but if this business is gonna survive, it needs to be self-sufficient, ok? I need to be self-sufficient. Do you want to grab a ribbon and forget your troubles? No. I want to grab some food and emotionally eat. How the apple fell so far from the christmas tree I will never know. what am I doing? oh, let's check this place out. - I'll be right here. - oh, my... hi, can I help you find anything? Oh, you. The phone thief. The phone thief? You are the one I borrowed a phone from when mine died. I see you charged it. I did. Mmhm. It's not every day you get to help out a famous dude, you know what I'm saying? Famous? Do you need a hint? Hi, I'm mariah marquez. Kerry. And this goofball is the great brad baxter. Guilty. We're acting together in ""my favorite santa"". Mm. Mmhm. I love your store by the way. This is so great. Oh, um. Well, let me know if you need anything. So, you are the king of christmas movies. You do know who I am. - No. - Hmm. My mother's mentioned it. Oh, yeah. Mothers love me. Mm. It's always so great to make a new fan. Friend. - Uh... - kerry? - I'll be over here. - Ok. This dress is so fabulous. It is classy and kicky. That one is new. I, um... I made it. And a few other ones over here. Just... Yeah. So, you sell clothes and design them? Well, yeah, it's... Something I do on the side. You have a real gift. Uh, brad? Yeah. Kerry here designed and made all these clothes. Amazing huh? Really? Wow. That's very cool. Did you know before I was an actor, I used to design and make my own furniture? Really? I just wouldn't have pegged you as a tool belt and power saw type. Oh yeah, yeah. Before I was the king of christmas, they called me the prince of pine. Unofficially, of course. Just a nickname. Ok. And that is our cue to leave, but I will be back. I promise. Ok. brought some extra decorations. Might as well cheer up this place too. Guess who you just missed. Please tell me our landlord. Brad... Baxter and mariah marquez. you're kidding me. No. Brad baxter and mariah marquez were right here in our little store? Yeah. She seemed nice. He was a little full of himself. Oh! Maybe I can still catch them! Uh! Which way did he go? Oh, sorry. Uh... Uh... Mom! brad! What do you mean she took another gig? Well, no, you're her agent, can't you do something? No, no, no, no. We can't match that amount. Not even close. Well not as sorry as I am. Thanks for nothing. you look like you just lost your best friend. Worse. Our costumer. She took a gig on the new matt damon film. Three months in Spain. Three times the pay. Our first fitting's in two hours. Is everything gonna be ok? Nope. I may have an idea. Mariah said that? Oh yeah, she raved about your store and you. Love the christmas decorations, by the way. It's never too early for christmas, right? Yeah. Sorry, what exactly... Do you need? Um... Everything. Yeah, that way I'll have a ton of clothes on hand until I get a new costumer. The whole store? Is that a yes? that's it. Perfect. Oh, a tiny favor. Could you come over to set? Just in case there's any questions about the clothes as we put them on the racks. - To the movie set? - Mmhm. Me? Yeah. Kerry... This young man just bought out our entire store. Well... I think you know what that means. Yes, of course, I could do that. Great. I'll see you outside. I knew something would turn up. You didn't say it was gonna be a miracle. A christmas miracle. I am so sorry, I forgot to ask. What's your return policy? Oh. Sorry. You must be kerry. Huh? Here's the script. Scene breakdown, shooting schedule, maps. Everything you'll need. Ok. For what, sorry? Caleb said you would handle the first costume fitting. What? You design your own clothes, right? Well yeah, but... You read the scene, match clothes, make 'em fit, the end. Please? There's no one else to do it and you would be doing me a solid. Come on. Oh! This will be the scene that you'll be fitting. Ok. It's the first scene up tomorrow. Things are a little crazy right now. Just do the best you can, ok? Go for jamie. No. No, no, no, no, don't- - I'll get him right now. - Don't... Ok. Read the scene. Match the clothes and make them feel... - Oh! - Oh! We meet again. Brad. Hi. it's, uh, kerry, right? Yep. Word is we have a new costumer. That's temporary. Very, very temporary. Well, I am in your capable hands. Make me look great. I know, it's a tough job but somebody's gotta do it, right? ha, ha, ha! There it is! Hmm. oh, uh, right. I actually haven't, uh, read the scene yet so I don't know... It's ok. It's cold, snowy. "silent night" plays softly in the background. I'm trying to convince this amazing woman that she's the one for me. She's flattered, but surprised. After all, we have only just met. We gaze into each other's eyes because there's no stopping love during the holiday time. We kiss. It's magic. Snow falls all around us. And scene! Oh. I mean, they don't call me the king of christmas movies for nothing. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm sure they don't. - Mm. - Hm. Well, let's find you something to wear to fall in love in the snow. That sounds perf'. I'll see you back at my trailer. Perf'. She's available? Excellent! No, no, no, not in five months, I need her in five minutes. Sandwich? Could you just hold for a second? Jamie, please remind jill that she needs to be at the tree lighting ceremony tonight? We all need to be there. Don't forget about the tree lighting ceremony tonight. You can tell my ex-husband that I will be there but not because he asked. She'll be there, but yeah, thank you, jamie. I heard. Oh, jamie, please remind caleb to go easy on the coffee. He knows what it does to his stress level. Uh, jamie, please thank jill for her concern but we both know it's not the coffee causing me stress. listen, honeymoons are overrated. She can go on her honeymoon- -jill, wait! in three weeks after we wrap the film. Why are you so serious? You do know this is the fun part. I have never done this before and I want to get it right. Oh, please. I saw your work at your store. - You're really good. - Mmhm. Don't sell yourself short. I never do. Woah! Rule number one. What? Never cover the money maker. Oh! Right. See? Isn't that better? Let's see. I have an idea. Ok. I like ideas. Hear me out. Oh no. That is enormous. Imagine, okay, when you go in for your kiss, you can hardly do it because your enormous parka is in the way, but somehow, you know, you manage to do it. Oooh! it's stupid. - No, no, no, no, no, no! - It is. That... That is a really great idea. - Really? - Yeah. - Let's try it on then. - Alright. Here we go, do this. give me your arm. Ok, here we go. Really, sort of, sorry. Suck... It... In. ok. oh, that's funny. This is good. This is good. Good job. Oh, honey! Mom! What are you doing here? I found these darling christmas sweaters in the storeroom and I thought you might need 'em. Who let you in? Oh, that sweet security guard. Kerry, who is your friend? Uh... This is my mother. Your mother? Is this... This is the same mother that you told me about? Yep. You only have one. Did you tell him about me? Hi, I'm brad, brad baxter. - Nancy. - It's nice to meet you. Nancy devine. Can I say that I am an enormous fan? Yes, you can. You can say it all you want and the louder and more often the better. uh-oh, bad times, boss? Every costumer I've tried in this industry is either busy or an extortionist. Oh, hi. - Do you work for me? - Uh, no. This is my mother. Oh, nice to meet you. Wait, how did the fitting go? Oh, yeah, I think it was... Ok, I think? Pffft! It was not "ok." uh-oh. It was... Terrific! In fact you should hire her until you find someone. Yeah? Oh, no. No, no, no. I have a... A store to run and I am very not qualified. Woah, woah... What did I say about selling yourself short? She's a natural, totally gets me, by the way, and she came up with this great comedy bit. - Ok, great. - Yeah. Well, you know I would only need you for the one day, well, maybe two... Maybe three. Anyways, I'll pay your day rate up front. - She'll do it. - No. What? I don't even know. I don't have one of those. The... A day rate. I... Well honey, you will now. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, take your time. what are you even doing? Honey, I know this is overwhelming but you need money... Now. ok, ok. Kerry. You can do this. Come on. Come on. Uh, ok. I'll do it. Great. But don't say that I didn't warn you. I, I will not say that... Ever. Ok. 'cause... Sisters. Right? Oh. yeah. uh... Next qu I'm wondering, how did you end up choosing where to shoot? Oh, I can take that one. Two words, tax incentives. sorry, it's a producer joke. Uh... No, twelve oaks is a charming, beautiful place and they have a lovely tradition where they close down their city centre for their christmas tree lighting ceremony. hey, everybody! I'm mayor dennis lee and welcome to our early christmas tree lighting ceremony in honor of our special hollywood visitors. So, without further ado, I'd like you to meet the stars of "my favorite santa" who will be lighting this fantastic tree, brad baxter and mariah marquez. alright! yes! Alright! Wow! Thank you! Listen, mariah and I are so honored to be here with all of you to light this beautiful, amazing tree. three, two, one! and what would a tree lighting be without snow? So, let it snow! oh, you're having a baby? That's, um... When? Oh, that's six weeks from now. We'll have you outta here in three. Yeah. No, no, no. No, no, no it's not that close. I mean it's just, oh... Ok, ok. No, I understand. Yeah, thank you. Congratulations. sorry, I didn't mean to overhear. Still no luck finding anyone? Yeah, yeah, batting less than zero. Which, I don't even know how that's possible. Hey, I gotta tell you, I love the reindeer scarf that you put brad in. The whole outfit looks amazing, so... - Great. - Oh, this is... - Hi, I'm jill. - Jill. Yeah. - Hi. - Hello. Thank you so much for jumping in last minute. Even if it wasn't cleared with me first by the producer. one thing. I'm just wondering if you could switch out that reindeer scarf for something a little bit brighter, more colorful? Um, jamie, could you tell jill that I happen to love the reindeer scarf? Jill, caleb loves the scarf. Remind caleb that he once valued and trusted my opinion, making me a more confident filmmaker, so I am now confidently overruling him. So- -I heard. Thank you again, so much. Yes. Yeah, yeah. I am so sorry about that. It's a very long story with a short fuse. Anyway, first day, huh? So, good luck, ok? oh, I gotta get this. But if you're hungry, get some breakfast, ok? Because we're not shooting for like another hour. yeah? Hello? Susan? Susan, tell me you're available! Everyone's talking about how you saved the day. Oh, hi. really? They are? Um, well somebody should save me. I probably shouldn't have said that. Just have fun and enjoy all this good food. so, I assume you've seen the jill and caleb comedy hour? Yeah, caleb said it was a long story. I'll give you the short version. Hey, guys. So, caleb and jill used to be a team and they were huge. Twenty christmas movies in 10 years. So, when they decided to get a divorce a few years ago... Control issues, trust, the usual. They stopped getting work. Until, dazzle plus calls wanting to get into the christmas movie game with "my favorite santa". An old script of jill's that caleb was still attached to produce. Dazzle plus says hey, listen, you come in on budget, deliver a hit, we'll guarantee you a six-picture christmas movie deal. If they can find a way to work together. Without actually working together. Wow. No wonder jamie has her hands full. Oh yeah, after this shoot, she deserves a purple heart. Sad thing is, they used to be so good together. Always on the same page to finish each other's sentences. A real unit. I mean, it was like, wow. I want what they have. Oh. Make that a nobel peace prize. After all, isn't christmas the best time to fall in love? I'm not sure I've ever heard that exactly, but if you really are santa, I guess you would know. Oh, I am. And I do. and cut. Love it. That's lunch, everyone. - Wardrobe. - Oh. - Get the coats. - Yeah. great. - I think so, right. - how'd we do? I know my mic's stuck in here somewhere. - Woah! You see the jacket gag. - That was good. It totally worked. You know this was kerry's idea? No, really? I loved that! I was thinking... Uh, jamie, could you just tell jill um, thank you for the great morning. Oh... Well, uh, jill, caleb says thank you for a great first morning. Tell caleb that he is welcome and thank him for bringing in the good snow team. The shot looked amazing. Yeah, it did. Ok, uh, good. Ok. Kerry? Kerry! I got you something. Mom, what are you doing here?! You can't keep showing up like this. Why? Who's running the store? Oh, you mean the empty store? Don't worry. I left a sign. "be back soon! Unless brad baxter proposes" nice. What... Anyway, I just wanted to see how you're doing around all the movie people. Yeah. - Oh, what's for lunch? - No. Don't. You know I checked out main street on the way here. everything is absolutely magnificent. - All that snow! - Mmmhmm. What is it made of actually? I wondered... It's mostly foam, there's a little crushed ice and some potato flakes. Hello, brad. Hi... Nancy! Are you joining us for lunch? - No! - Is it ok? For you? Of course. Grab a box. Oh! Have you really never seen any of my movies? - Did my mother tell you that? - Maybe. Don't take it personally. Well, they're my movies. How else am I supposed to take it? Ha! Oh, please! You're brad baxter. What do you care what I think? Because... You seem cool and smart and talented and authentic and I want you to like me. Like everybody else does. - Uh-huh. - Mmmhmm. It's not showbiz all the time. Well who says I don't like you? Yes! So you do like me! Excellent! Ok. Back to 100. Alright. Nancy, you want to join me over here? - Yes. - Yes! - Kerry, you coming? - Nope. Ok. We'll be over here. In case you want to. Whoo. hi, wow. I can't believe you actually have a white picket fence. can I come in? Um, kerry, I'd like to hire you full time. no. Mmmhmm. You mean there's absolutely no one else you can find? Oh, no. I've tried. There's not a costumer to be had anywhere. Yeah. It's uh, it's a problem this close to the holidays. I mean, thank you for thinking that I'm capable of... Kerry, trust me. We have done a lot of hiring in our day and you can do it. That would mean you would have to run retro fit. Yes. Full time... By yourself. Kerry, if you don't take this job I am gonna change the locks on the store and close it for good. - So do it! - Oh. Ok. thank you. Thank you so much. Both of you. I just, oh... That's... I needed that so much. uh... Ok. and now we return to "three times the christmas". oh, actually, I have a question for jill. A lot of people have been asking how such a hip santa came to pass. Was that how you had originally envisioned the style of the character? Well, yes and no. See, while we were shooting we got a kind of unexpected request from dazzle. So, we have a costume crisis. What is it? Dazzle hates brad's santa costume. They said that it's classic but boring. They want something different. Well, I mean, it's a santa suit, so how different can it get? well, think something bolder. More stylized. Elevated. And sorry, but we are still shooting after lunch. You got this, kerry. am I not the coolest santa or what? Woo! Kerry, it's sensational. A total game changer! Yeah, it's terrific, but dazzle's never gonna go for this. Wha? What? You said they wanted different. This... Is different. It is the perfect combination of old and new. And traditional and chic. And I, for one, think I look great. Not to make this about me. I completely agree with you. I say we send some photos to dazzle. Thank you. Ok. We tell them that we love this, see what comes back. Thank you. I think we need to take a stand on this. Yes. Ok, jamie, can you tell jill that... I agree. And I do value her opinion. That's really... Uh... Yeah. But hey, whatever happens, I meant what I said. This costume is next level. You, kerry devine, are going places. Well, I watched one of your christmas movies last night. You did? Yeah. Christmas uh, three... - Ah, "three times christmas". - That's it. Yes. I did some great stuff in that. What'd you think? I thought you, brad baxter, are going places. Oh! - I'm okay. - It's uh, christmas tree. Oh, kerry, dazzle thinks you're a genius! They're all in on the santa suit. - Really? - Yes! That's fantastic! It is! Awesome! Yeah. Ok. Oh, um, I also have some less than great news. Now that we know what costumes we need for the film, I'm probably going to have to return about half of what I bought from you. Oh, so you're gonna need about half the money back? Yes. Great. You know what? Hey, you guys, stop there. What about a consolation prize. Christmas tree, huh? We'll load it up with all the trimmings, ok? So, uh, keep up the great work. You're doing awesome. Ok, we'll see you soon. I... - Hey. - Hey. I was just- baking christmas cookies in November? Well... While watching a brad baxter movie. Relax. I was just trying to see if I could remember dad's recipe and that, that's research. Oh. Well, I haven't had one of these since... When your dad made 'em that last christmas. Yeah. Should have never taken that trip. Honey, you have to let that go. You had no way of knowing he was gonna get sick. Oh, delicious! Just like dad's. burnt on the bottom. - a christmas cook off. - Mm. I just adore this movie. do they always do that little, that chk-chk thing? Honey, you have so much to catch up on. Apparently. to my favorite santa. Aw, well to my favorite leading lady. Aw, thanks b.B. Just don't tell any of my other costars. Your secret's safe with me. See, I can always trust you. Um, any other secrets I should be keeping? Like any special feelings you might be having about a certain costumer? Oh! I see the way you look at her. Don't... And she is lovely. Well, you know I have my rules. No on set romances. Rules are made to be broken. She is nice. She's like adorable but down to earth, you know? Kind of shy but self-effacing. She's like strong... Not that you've been paying attention. Ok. I see what you did there. Look, I get it. I would just say, take it one step at a time, ok? just came to say good night. Oh, I was just, um... Your dad and I never should have let you quit after one semester. Well... If you couldn't even get into their little freshman fashion show you'd probably quit too. It didn't exactly scream "I belong." I just wish you hadn't gotten so discouraged. I mean, look at all these. You were so much better than you thought. Maybe. Beautiful. - Sleep well, honey. - Ok, you too. ah, my, uh, gosh, they were all so great to play. But if I had to choose one, I'd um, hm... I think I'd go with the bakery scene that was about halfway through the film. It gets to me just thinking about it. Do you know how I know? Because you're santa claus? Because with the right person by your side, anything is possible. hold... And cut! Gorgeous. Gorgeous. That's a keeper. excuse me. ...So the christmas hats are on their way. Funny thing, they actually have them in green and red. So you can choose. Oh, sorry. Uh, jamie, can you please ask caleb why he was upset at the end of the bakery scene today? I was just remembering when you wrote that line. "when you have the right person on your side, "anything's possible." caleb, it's a really old script. It's like 100 years ago. It's six. You wrote it about our marriage, jill. About our success, about what we had when we had it. Because of each other. I wrote it about a guy who claims to be santa and a baker who has lost her belief in christmas. But the words were based on us. We used to be crazy about each other, jill. Yeah, and now we're just crazy. Or at least acting that way. I mean this whole... Look at us, talking without an interpreter for once. Yeah, finally. Talking through jamie was the stupidest idea ever. I'm pretty sure that was your idea. Well, they can't all be gems. I, um, I need to go and prep for tomorrow, so. Yeah. Good night, caleb. Good night, jill. Gee, I am pretty sure I remember someone saying about christmas. "I just don't like to overdo it." well, caleb offered me all of this stuff and I didn't want to be rude, so... Honey, I am so happy things are going so well for you on the movie. And, you get to hang out with brad baxter all day. That's a nice bonus. Mom, he's a movie star. We have very different worlds. Honey, when are you gonna believe anything is possible? Would you hand me that crystal star, please? Wow. isn't that pretty? shoots in london? Woah. And you sure they asked for me? It's, no, it's awesome. I'm... Heck yes, please tell them I'm interested and that's superb. Thank you, lucy. Ok. Ok, yeah. I look forward to it. Bye-bye. Oh, hey. You, uh, heading home or pulling an all-nighter? Ha! Home, after I press these costumes for tomorrow. Yeah? Big plans this weekend? Oh, uh, yeah. My mom and I, we're gonna make our famous fried chicken and then, if I'm feeling really wild, I'm gonna wash my hair. You know... I just never get a good home-cooked meal when I'm on the road. It's just really something I miss. Oh, I mean, you're welcome to join. I'm in. What time? uh... hi. I, uh, didn't know what to bring, so I brought it all. - Ok, come in. - Ok. You really know how to decorate. Wow, this meal was incredible. I can't believe you made a full christmas dinner. Oh, it was just a little something we threw together. Yeah, no biggie, just... You should see what she does for actual christmas. oh, I bet. Oh, I am told that I go over the top. I'm just a little crazy for christmas. Well, they don't call it the most wonderful time of the year for nothing. Every christmas morning, wherever I am, first thing I have to watch. "it's a wonderful life". - Really? - Yes. Every christmas. You know, I think it was when my dad first showed me as a kid. It was pretty special. "what do you want, mary? You want the moon? "just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it "and pull it down." oh! Wow. Yeah? No? Nothing? - bravo! - Thank you. Oh, my goodness! You have to do the remake. oh, god. Brad baxter as george bailey. Now, who wouldn't want to see that? Uh, me. For starters, and apparently your daughter. just kidding. I'm kidding. No, talk about being set up to fail. No, I have been there and... That was a low point. Story for another time. it is so nice to hear this piano again. Aw. It's been quite a few years. My late husband, dean, was the only person that could play the piano in this household, right? Yeah. Ah. Oh wow. That must have been really hard losing him. On both of you. It was, but kerry was my rock. I couldn't have done it without her. He was a very sweet, kind, generous man. And an even better cook than me. If you can believe that. I don't know. what about you, brad? What are your parents like? My parents are, uh, they're amazing. They, they're kind and funny and hard-working and still ridiculously in love after like 40 years. Yeah. I just... I hope to one day be as happy as they are. Um, I don't mean to be nosy, but aside from the rumors, have you ever been close? What's the matter with you? No, no, no. It's ok, it's ok. Really. Well, uh, I thought I was, nancy, a few times, actually. - But not close enough, I guess. - Hmm. But you know what? I'm a blue skies kind of guy, so, I live in hope. Ok, hey, let's see who knows... "all I want for christmas is you"? I, uh, no. - I do. - Come on over. ok. I want you to go, do, do, do, ok? do, do, do, do... yes. Ready? Here we go. thank you to you and your mom. That was my best night out in ages. Wow. Your life is as boring as mine. Ok. I don't know if I would go that far. I mean, I am still the king of christmas. Right, yes. Speaking of which, this brad has been nice getting to know compared to the showbiz. Enjoy your day off. I'll see you on set. Good night. Santa. Good night. Costume lady. ok, folks, spill some tea. Any on set romances we should know about? oh, uh... Cowards! Come on! Uh, well look, the truth is, movie sets aren't exactly the hive of romantic activity that people think. This came for you. Uh... What is it? Well, it's not gonna open itself. to kerry devine, costume ninja. Ok. this note will entitle the holder to an unforgettable dinner with a not so secret admirer. Rsvp to brad baxter asap. Is santa inviting me to dinner? Would you settle for the actor that plays santa? It depends on what it is. Well, see he had such a great time with you and your mom, that he just really wants to return the favor. You'd like to invite my mom to dinner? Well, I'm crazy about your mom. But would really love some quality time alone with her daughter. Um, she accepts. ...Wow. a-ha! Thank you, sir. Oh, yeah. I recognize this. Mmmhmm. Servino's? From the village. How? All the way from new york? How did you do this? Well, let's just say I know people. Yeah, it must be good to be brad baxter. It is right now. Ah, but there's more. ok. And I know what you're thinking. Mm. That you can never have too much christmas, right? I am starting to believe that. You have to try this pizza. Ok, I've been dying. Here we go. It's the best in the world. Ah. Just dig in, just go for it. Ok, here we go. Oh, my gosh! Oh! Is that not the best? Ok, so tell me. Did you always want to be an actor? Hm. Ha. No, actually, uh-uh. I sort of... I sort of just stepped in it. Uh, I tagged along with a buddy to an audition, years ago, and he didn't get the part. Uh-huh. And I did. Just for sitting there. They said that I looked the part. Whatever that means. And I had no idea what I was doing. To tell you the truth, I still don't really know what I'm doing. You and me both. So that was end of the prince of pine career? Oh yeah. It was, it was a great loss to the furniture ecosystem. the other night you mentioned something about um... A low point? Mm. Mmhmm. I was just curious. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. - No, no, no. Mmmm. - Sorry. No. I was offered this part in this edgy little low budget indie film, but I backed out when I was offered more money for another movie. I grew up poor. So anytime I was offered more money for anything I took it. Um, but anyways, "sunrise highway" goes on to become this critics' darling. - "sunrise highway"? - Yeah. - You gave up "sunrise highway"? - Yeah. - Oh. - Yeah, thank you. no, I'm sorry! - no, it's ok. - Oh, that's awful. Trust me, I'm grateful for my career, but... I'm also human. You know, sometimes I wonder what my career would look like had I just taken a risk, you know? Mm. Mmhm. I do. I get it. I was in fashion school. - Yeah? - Yeah. - In new york. - A-ha! Ok. Uh, and I dropped out. Why? Mm. I wasn't good enough. I couldn't cut it. What? You're so talented. No. But you can't go backwards, you can only move forwards. I think you just have to climb the mountain. You know? Spread your wings and take a leap. All that... Stuff. Well, it's funny you should say that. I was just offered a starring role in this new edgy indie thriller called "ryan's game". Do you like it? Do you want to do it? I do, yes, it's... I mean, it's risky. I don't know. Is it right for me? I mean, it could be, but... You should do what makes you happy. I should do what makes me happy. Dance with me. come on. oh hey, um, these seats are free, if you dare. After you. Um, it's just a late night menu but the burger's pretty good. Would you look at that? I'm getting a call from my dad, sorry, one sec. Would you like a fry? They're crinkle cut. Your favorite. Thank you. Look at us. With all these super important things that we can talk about now. caleb, what you said the other day about that line... "with the right person on your side... "anything is possible." yeah. Because for a long time it was possible. I mean, it's like when I wrote that script. It was a really joyous experience. We were in a good place and it just flowed right out of me. We let a lot of stupid things get in the way, jill. I know. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. What'd I miss? Uh... I think it's called a ceasefire. This is amazing. All the decorations make everything look so magical. It's a huge draw for the fans, you know? All part of the christmas fantasy. Hm. You part of that fantasy? I am just an actor, playing a role. But, if I can make my audiences happy, bring a little joy to their lives? Then I'm happy. You know what would make me really happy? Name it. You better run. it's not even real! Mmhm. You think? oh. But it was so fun watching you try. You know... There is one good thing you can do in this snow. Oh boy. come here. You gotta help me up. I think I'm stuck. Oh! ok. this is kerry. Um, I... Yes, I would love that. Ker, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be on the set? Uh, I forgot the garment bag. I need to head back. - Um. - Ok. I didn't tell you this because I didn't actually think it was gonna happen, but I applied for this random fashion design job online and um, I got an interview. Day after tomorrow. On zoom. In new york. New york! Yes! Don't worry, they're not hiring me right away but I guess they kind of liked my designs. Oh, honey, this is fantastic. I'm so proud of you. You're finally following your dream. Whatever you decide, whatever happens, I'm behind you 100 percent. Thank you. New york! Nick, no one's asking you to leave town. Especially before christmas. You'd be making a big mistake. No. I can't stay in a place where no one believes in me. We believe in you. I believe in you. As, as a person, as nick. We just don't believe you're santa claus. Is this working? I just, I don't know if this is working. I mean, I feel like she is going to lose the man she loves and I just... I feel like she's not feeling how major that is. Well, maybe it's less about what she's saying and more about what she's not saying? You know, what is she not realizing here. Hm? What do you think? I was just thinking this scene it's, um, it's like with my dad. I didn't get to spend our last christmas with him and I've regretted it ever since. I should have cherished the moment, but... We didn't know. I always thought there was gonna be another christmas. But, evie does know that this is the end. And she's gonna let nick go anyway, so I think to answer brad's question, what she needs to be realizing, what she needs to be feeling is that she's going to regret it for a long, long time. All set. Thank you. I think I have my motivation. we believe in you. I believe in you. As a person. As nick. We just don't believe you're santa claus. What do you believe, then, evie? I believe in the truth. But, I also believe that I'd regret letting you go. For a long, long time. And cut! wow. Beautiful work. thank you, by the way, for sharing that story about your dad earlier. I'm sure you really miss him. Yeah. Well, not to play amateur shrink or anything, but um, do you think missing your dad this last holiday season sort of put you off christmas a little bit? Ok. Not so amateur after all. oh. Uh, I'm sorry. - Oh. - It's my agent. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Just, real quick. hi, lucy, yeah. I know that they need an answer, yeah. Oh, now? Um... um, well, yeah, no, I have been thinking about it a lot and you can go ahead and tell them yes. Yeah, you can tell them a big, fat, appreciative yes! I know! You're right. It's gonna be amazing. Alright, well then I guess, yeah, no, we'll talk tomorrow. Ok. Alright, bye. So you're taking it. I'm gonna take... I'm taking it. I'm gonna take it, yeah. It starts right after my next christmas movie and, oh, in none other than london. Come with me. To london? I'm gonna need a costumer, I'm gonna need to look great. I trust you. It would be a blast. Come with me. - I appreciate the offer. - Ok. I do. I'm flattered, I am. I, uh, I just... I have maybe some good news myself. Ok, what? Well, I have an interview tomorrow for a women's design label in new york, as a designer. Uh, that's not good news, that's phenomenal news. That's like life-changing news. I want to talk about london... No, no, no, no, you know what? Don't even say a word. Don't even. I don't want you to think about it. I want you to go on that interview, ok? See what happens with that. And just know, I'll be in london with a job. Waiting for you. We have five extremely creative, talented, exciting candidates. Why should I choose you? I have seen the world of fashion from both the design perspective and the retail end which has given me a unique insight into how buyers think and what actually goes into a purchase. Tell me about your movie work. so how was it? Uh, ok. I think. Maybe better than ok. Apparently, I have a one in five chance, so, I guess, I'll be hearing from her in the next few days. Who knows? You may have a decision of your own to make. The big apple or big ben? what's the craziest thing that went wrong while making the movie? - ooh. - oh. uh, the craziest thing? Well, that would have to be... definitely when the crew showed up for the santa's workshop scenes. Yeah. hey, coming through, folks. Coming through. Excuse me, guys. Uh, excuse me, hi. I'm a... I'm a producer. What's happening? A small fire. A short in the breaker panel. It's all contained. Ok, ok, good. So, we can go in now? No sir, premises are off-limits. But we're shooting a movie. Not gonna happen. Not today. Sorry. Uh... We have a problem. Alright team, bottom line is unfortunately we have lost our location for the day. So, we can either rejig the script or we can change the schedule, but something has got to give here. Well, you know mariah and I can't extend. We're both jumping into other movies. Yes, brad, I know we need to finish this on time. But, the question is how. I just checked on the vintage clock shop, the gold rush museum and the old bottle factory. They're a no go, I'm sorry, guys. I've run out of strings to pull. Caleb, I don't have to tell you, these are our opening scenes. We have no movie without them. I know, jill. I'm trying, but we need a new location today and we need it addressed today. So, any suggestions? Anyone? Ok, this might sound crazy... I can't believe it but this might actually work. Kerry, we'll get everything back into place in time for you to open tomorrow. Don't worry about it, just do what you gotta do. Oh, I can help. Okay. this is looking good. if I can convince just one person that I am actually santa claus, then christmas can go on as scheduled. You elves hold the fort while I'm gone. And cut! That was great you guys. So much fun. well, we did it. You know what today reminded me of? Your worst nightmare? Well, old times. Some eleventh-hour disaster would hit and it'd be sink or swim. And we would always swim. 'cause you'd always figure out how to make it work. With you leading the way. Man, we were good. Yeah. We still are. Thanks for figuring how to get by without that third scene. We wouldn't have made the day if you hadn't, so... Yeah, ok. Ok. you know, costume lady. I'm beginning to think you're our lucky star. Starting to feel pretty lucky myself. I kind of think every movie set needs a kerry. Yeah? Even the one in london? Well, whatever you decide, I'm serious. I think you're born for this. It could be the perfect career. Hm. ah, ah, ah, ah! Just gonna steal... what is it, honey? I got it! lucy, it's brad. We gotta talk. hey, mom. Kerry, did you read the article I sent you? No. Uh, I'm sorry. I've just been crazy busy. it's been trending for the last hour. Brad has backed out on "ryan's game". What? No. He didn't mention anything to me. Well, is he there? Go see him. Uh, yeah, he... He is here. Just a sec. Honey, what have you decided about new york? Are you... hello? Hey. Oh, hi. Did you, uh, back out of "ryan's game"? Ah, yeah. I was gonna talk to you about this, but it was... I was offered the job in new york. You were! That's so wonderful! Yeah, it would have been. It would have been. But I turned it down. to come work with me in london. Mmmhmm. Oh, kerry. I am so sorry. I just completely... - Forgot about me. - No, no, no, no, no... - Brad, jill needs you on set. - Give me a second. copy that, we're on the move. Can we please talk about this later? - brad. - Ok? It's like it never crossed his mind, you know, to consider how him quitting the movie would affect anyone else. I know, honey. It doesn't exactly say "I'll be there for you." no, no. You know what it does say, though? That at heart he's still just "showbiz brad". And I'm just... Kerry from twelve oaks. Honey, maybe for you this... This friendship was just a lovely, unexpected bonus. Part of the wonderful unexpected experience of doing this film. And perhaps that's just where the story ends. Except in the movie version, you know, I, um... I'd get the guy and the gig. Honey, what if that position hasn't been filled yet? What if you got ahold of stella- no. And, and said you changed your mind? No. I would look like a flake. I should have jumped at the chance. Ok, so why didn't you? He told me I was born to work in movies. And I thought, maybe he's right. like I had found something that I was good at. Like, somewhere that I belonged. I don't know. Stupid. I should have never... Honey. You have so much to offer. There are other movies, you know. no. If you want to design in new york, you can do that too. No. No. I'm gonna go back to retro fit. I'm gonna pay off the debt and uh... Uh, mission accomplished. I should have never left. I should have never given up. You are the only one for me, evie. I just hope that I'm still the only one for you. You are. Completely. And coming back for me from such a long way tells me everything I need to know. I believe you now, nick. I really and truly do. I guess the reindeer and sleigh outside didn't hurt. I promise you, nick, you'll always be... My favorite santa. Hold and cut. That's picture wrap. congratulations everybody. Hotel bar 8:00pm tonight on us, ok? oh, thank you for everything. - Kerry, thank you so much. - Thank you. See you later. Well, I know I'm probably biased, but I'd say we made our best movie yet. Well, I like to think we learned a little something along the way. oh, thank you. Hey, costume lady. Hi. Brad. Cheers, to a great shoot. I want to thank you for your effort and creative genius on this. It was... Uh... It has been a wild ride. alright, everyone. Jill and I just wanted to make a little toast to all of you. Our crew, thank you so much for your hard work on this film. It means everything to us. And we also know that you've had a front row seat for these past few weeks to the caleb and jill comedy hour. yes, mariah, we know you call it that, but we love you anyway. We just wanted to say we are so sorry and apologetic if we drove anyone a little too crazy with our on-set antics. but making this movie made us realize that we could do so much better together than we do apart. yeah, not only as filmmakers but as a couple. So, we have made a decision to give love a second chance. So wish us luck, please! Cheers, everyone, thank you. wow. Didn't see that coming. No? I thought actors were supposed to be observant. Kerry, I think you might have overestimated me. I'll remember that the next time a movie star comes through town. Merry christmas. sorry, brad. Maybe some rules aren't made to be broken. so, what has everyone been up to since the end of the shoot? Well, jill and I just finished our first of six new films for dazzle plus. Oh! yes, it's a sequel that I wrote and directed, called, appropriately enough, "my favorite santa too". That's t-o-o. Starring none other than me as your first female santa claus. Woohoo! Give it up. hey brad, no part for you in it? Uh, well there was but I had a conflict. I was in london shooting an indie thriller, "ryan's game". It's super dark, total departure from me. Uh, which is why I turned it down at first, but fortunately their production got delayed and they came back to me and this time I said yes. And it comes out in March. thank you. What made you change your mind? Someone a whole lot wiser than me told me that I just needed to climb the mountain and spread my wings and take a leap. Um... What about you, kerr what have you been up to since we stopped shooting? Me? well... thank you. don't you two look happy. Love always conquers all, wouldn't you say? I'd say it has a little something to do with it, yeah. Ah, mayor lee. Thank you so much for everything. I think this might be one of our best locations yet. Oh, 100 percent. Now, that we're on the map, let's stay on the map? - Eh. - Eh? well, if we get to make a "my favorite santa too". We'll be back, I promise. Oh... well, if we get to make a "my favorite santa too", we'll be back. I promise. Ok. - got you! - Gonna hold you to that. Sounds good, mayor, thanks. - Thank you guys. - Ok. I love it here. Well... If you ever find yourselves back in twelve oaks and need a costumer... I'm your girl. Better yet, how 'bout you move to la? Huh? We can keep you very busy. For a very long time. - Really? - Yeah. I don't... I, I don't know what to say. Well just... Just think about it. Take your time and let us know, ok? Nancy. Thank you. - Oh my. - For everything. - Really think about it, ok? - Mmmhmm. My lifesaver. - Thanks for everything. - Mmmhmm. - We'll be in touch. - Ok. - ok. - alright. - alright, guys. - bye-bye. my mom and I, we closed up the store and I moved to la to start costume designing for caleb and jill. my first assignment, "my favorite santa too". Which, ironically was shot back in my hometown of twelve oaks. I am so proud of you, honey, and your father would have been proud of you too. The best is yet to come, I just know it. Well, I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't your belief in me, so thank you. Honey, I'm just so glad that we got to share this amazing event together. I must have 1,000 photos to put on my christmas movie page. I am sure you do. How 'bout one more? well, I thought you'd never ask. - Would you mind? - Oh, of course. - thank you. - Of course. You both look beautiful. Well, I think it's time for a refill. Excuse me. - Uh, so, london? - Yes. Finally. - I did it. - Hm. I really want you to know that what I said in there I meant. You were the one that inspired me to take that part. Oh... Well. I, uh... I wouldn't have worked on "my favorite santa" if it wasn't for you chiming in, so. We're even. It turns out I'm not exactly the showbiz after-party kind of guy anymore, so um... I'll see you around. Ok. bye, brad. Kerry, um... I am so sorry. Ok? I backed out of that role 'cause of me. I was selfish. I was thinking about me and my brand and my image and showbiz brad. You know, I have spent most of my life believing I wasn't enough and you came in and you changed that. And part of me wants to thank you. You made me real. I never felt so real in my life and it terrified me. So, I did what I do and I ran and I hid. I was the coward. That's on me. But I am so sorry that I hurt you. So I am really happy that you're doing well. I think I'm going to call it a night. I left you once before and I am not leaving you again. Please, give me a chance to show you... You just did. a lot of people are looking at us. - You want to get out of here? - Mmmhmm. Come with me. Come on. Let's go. Who's your favorite santa now? The real one.
