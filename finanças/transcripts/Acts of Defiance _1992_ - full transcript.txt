PAY 2 WINNERS $250 EACH. 2 GAGNANTS 250 $ CHAQUE. THIS IS KAHNAWAKE, MOHAWK TERRITORY, OPENING NIGHT. $5,000... I JUST WANTED TO SAY ON BEHALF OF THE CLAN MOTHERS A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO OUR WARRIORS, BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS TONIGHT. BECAUSE THEY ARE FULFILLING THEIR DUTY BY MAINTAINING AND PROTECTING THE BOUNDARIES OF KAHNAWAKE... [ Applause ] OKAY. THE LAST DIGIT. WE'LL GO FOR THE WHOLE NUMBER AGAIN... MAKE SURE WE DON'T MAKE MISTAKES. 0, 7... OH YEAH, WHEN WE DO THE LAST... WE ONLY GIVE AWAY A CAR ONCE IN THE FIRST DAY... THIS LITTLE MACHINE RIGHT HERE... DON'T STAND TOO CLOSE IN FRONT OF IT... IT WAS DONATED BY THE WARRIORS SOCIETY, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL'S IN IT. [ Laughter ] THE NUMBER IS 0, 7, 6, 0, 2, 1. [ Cheers ] MOHAWKS HAVE NOT APPLIED FOR A LOTTERY PERMIT. AUTHORITIES WILL SEIZE THE PRIZE. - DID YOU CONSIDER ANYTHING LESS CONTROVERSIAL THAN A BINGO HALL? UH, NO. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO IT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL, AGAINST THE LAW... UNLESS WE WANT TO KOWTOW TO THE GOVERNMENT. MOHAWKS CALL THEM SQ, THE SURETE DU QUEBEC PROVINCIAL POLICE FORCE. THEY HAVE RAIDED KAHNAWAKE... OCCUPIED AKWASASNE. THEN THEY ATTACKED A COMBINED GROUP OF MOHAWKS OVER A LAND DISPUTE AT KANESETAKE NEAR OKA. I COULD SEE THE SMOKE BLOWING THAT WAY TOWARDS THE ROAD, AND THEY STARTED COMING OVER, JUST LIKE ON TV. THEY STARTED COMING OVER. AND I SAW THEM AND I SAID, THEY'RE COMING IN. AND THEN... - IT WAS AT THAT POINT THAT THEY OPENED FIRE. WE REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT IT... FROM THE BEGINNING WE EXPECTED A CONFRONTATION, BUT WE DIDN'T EXPECT THE INTENSITY OF THE ATTACK. WE EXPECTED TO BE MET WITH THE RIOT SQUAD OR DOGS. WE WERE PERFECTLY WILLING TO GET ARRESTED. THEY INSISTED LATER ON THAT THEY WERE ONLY SHOOTING OVER OUR HEADS, BUT THE BULLET HOLES IN THE TREES ARE AT CHEST LEVEL AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY WEREN'T SHOOTING TO KILL US. IT WAS REFERRED TO AS A BOTCHED RAID. NO ONE WOULD DARE IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD THE RAID BEEN DECLARED A SUCCESS. ♪ MOHAWK PEOPLE SEEKING TALKS ♪ ♪ WHITE MAN'S PEOPLE THROWING ROCKS ♪ ♪ THE WARRIORS' CAUSE WILL BE REMEMBERED ♪ ♪ NO NATIVE LAND WILL BE SURRENDERED ♪ ♪ GOD DAMN MULRONEY GOD DAMN BOURASSA ♪ ♪ GOD DAMN THE ARMY AND THE SURETE ♪ ♪ GOD DAMN MULRONEY GOD DAMN BOURASSA ♪ ♪ GOD DAMN LASALLE AND CHATEAUGUAY ♪ [ Cheers ] [ Speaking native language ] THE LONGHOUSE AT KAHNAWAKE: A SACRED PLACE. THIS IS A SPECIAL DAY. GUESTS REPRESENTING SEVERAL EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN NATIONS ARE HERE. THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAS PASSED A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING CANADA FOR ITS TREATMENT OF NATIVE PEOPLE. THIS DELEGATION IS ON A FACT-FINDING MISSION. IN WELCOMING OUR GUESTS HERE TODAY, HE ALSO GIVES GREETINGS TO YOU, HE EXTENDS THE GREETINGS OF OUR LEADERS. NATIVES FROM ACROSS CANADA HAVE COME HERE TO MEET THE DELEGATION. WELCOME OFFICIALLY TO KAHNAWAKE. GRAND CHIEF JOE NORTON WELCOMES ELIJAH HARPER. ELIJAH HARPER: NO ONE SPARED HIM A THOUGHT UNTIL HISTORY WAS IN HIS HANDS. CANADA WAS REDRAFTING ITS CONSTITUTION. THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP THE COUNTRY TOGETHER BUT NATIVE PEOPLE WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROCESS. THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND WE BROUGHT THAT TO THE ATTENTION OF CANADIANS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND HOPEFULLY GOVERNMENTS WILL START LISTENING. [ Singing ] AFTER ELIJAH HARPER SCUTTLED THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD, NATIVE PEOPLE WERE TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY AS A POLITICAL FORCE. [ Singing ] THE EUROPEAN DELEGATION VISITS THE KAHNAWAKE SUPER BINGO HALL, CLOSED SINCE LAST SUMMER. MANY EUROPEANS ARE INTERESTED IN HOW CANADA COPES WITH NATIVE QUESTIONS. THE INTEREST, OF COURSE, HAS BEEN FUELLED IN RECENT MONTHS BY THE PUBLICITY GENERATED BY THE EVENTS IN OKA. WE DID NOT COME HERE WITH PRECONCEIVED CONVICTIONS. WE COME HERE WITH AN OPEN MIND AND WE WILL LISTEN DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO ORGANIZATIONS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, BUT ALSO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC. OUR JOB IS NOT-- AND THAT MAY SURPRISE YOU FOR A POLITICIAN-- IS NOT TO TALK, BUT TO LISTEN. THE EUROPEANS WILL NOW BE TOLD ABOUT THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE LAST SUMMER. WHAT'S GOING ON ACTUALLY IN MY WAY OF LOOKING AT IT IS THAT THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC WANTS TO SETTLE ITS INTERNAL SITUATION, THE INDIAN SITUATION, BEFORE IT VENTURES ON THE NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH CANADA. WHEN THEY LOST THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD THAT'S WHEN THEY REALLY STARTED KICKING US AROUND. BECAUSE THEY SAY IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MEECH LAKE. IT DOES. BECAUSE WHAT WENT ON IN THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD WAS ONLY FROM 11 MEN. NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT WAS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. NOTHING WAS EVER MENTIONED ABOUT THE ABORIGINAL PERSON IN THAT MEECH LAKE. SO I TIP MY HAT TO ELIJAH HARPER FOR THROWING THE MONKEY WRENCH IN THE MACHINE. MOHAWKS CONSIDERED THEMSELVES NORTH AMERICAN, A SOVEREIGN PEOPLE, PART OF THE IROQUOIS CONFEDERACY, WHOSE INFLUENCE WAS FELT AS FAR AS THE MISSISSIPPI. CANADA'S FEDERAL INDIAN AFFAIRS MINISTER WOULD CALL THE MOHAWKS 18th CENTURY IMMIGRANTS FROM THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. MOHAWKS WOULD ANSWER THAT CANADA AND THE U.S. DIDN'T EVEN EXIST UNTIL RECENTLY, THEY DISLIKED BEING CALLED IMMIGRANTS BY RECENTLY DISPLACED PERSONS FROM EUROPE. THE ISSUES ARE SOVEREIGNTY, THE ISSUES ARE JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS HAS ISSUED SOME SORT OF POINT PARAMETERS FOR NATIONHOOD AND THEY RELATE TO IDENTIFIABLE GEOGRAPHIC AREA, TRADITIONAL HOLDINGS, THE CAPACITY TO DEFEND, AND THE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION BY THE PEOPLE. EVEN WITHIN THAT CONTEXT OUR PEOPLE HAVE THEIR TRADITIONAL LANDS. OUR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED, HISTORICALLY. OUR WILLINGNESS TO DEFEND THIS LAND IS NO LONGER IN QUESTION. AS FOR THE CONTROL, IT IS IN THE HANDS OF OUR PEOPLE, NOT IN THE HANDS OF REPRESENTATIVES, NOT IN THE HANDS OF PRIME MINISTERS, PREMIERS, MINISTERS. IT'S IN THE HANDS OF OUR PEOPLE, WHERE IT'S GOING TO STAY. THE TRADITIONAL WAY FOR MOHAWKS TO MAKE DECISIONS IS BY CONSENSUS. COLONIAL RULERS OUTLAWED THE PRACTICE. PUPPET-ELECTED BAND COUNCILS WERE THEN SET UP UNDER POLICE PROTECTION. FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THIS, ONLY A TINY PROPORTION OF IROQUOIS SEE THESE COUNCILS AS LEGITIMATE. YET THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES RECOGNIZED BY CANADIAN LAW. Mr. MULRONEY AND Mr. BOURASSA SEE THE LOSS OF IROQUOIS LAND AS SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO THE PAST. IN TRUTH, MOHAWKS HAVE LOST MORE LAND SINCE 1950 THAN IN THE PREVIOUS 100 YEARS. THEY HAVE LOST IT TO COMPULSORY PURCHASE BY WHITE GOVERNMENTS EAGER TO BUILD BRIDGES, LIKE THE MERCIER, HYDRO DAMS AND THE ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY CHEAPLY AT INDIAN EXPENSE. THEY HAVE FOUND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES 18 MILES FROM HERE. THEY SAID INDIANS WERE NEVER THERE. OUR PEOPLE HAD EXISTED ON THIS SITE FOR 4,000 YEARS. IN QUEBEC CITY, PLACE ROYALE, WHERE CHAMPLAIN LANDED, THEY JUST FOUND AN IROQUOIS VILLAGE DOWN BELOW. TADOUSSAC, THEY FOUND IROQUOIS TRADING WITH MONTAGNAIS INDIANS. MOHAWK HUNTING AND FISHING CAMPS AS FAR NORTH AS LAKE MISTASSINI. NOW HOCHELAGA, THEY TRY TO SAY IT'S ANOTHER GROUP WHO VANISHED THAT WERE LIVING THERE. - IT'S OURS, BUT THERE'S NO WAY... WE WON'T KICK A MILLION PEOPLE OFF AN ISLAND JUST BECAUSE WE OWN IT. WE'LL SAY WE HAVE TITLE TO IT, AND GET SOME COMPENSATION. IF WE BUY A PIECE OF LAND IN CHATEAUGUAY, SINCE WE ALREADY OWN IT, WE WON'T PAY TAXES ON THE LAND. WHAT'S MORE CRIMINAL THAN WHITE EUROPEANS, TAKING THE WHOLE, STEALING THE WHOLE CONTINENT, 2 CONTINENTS, AND SLAUGHTERING THE PEOPLE TO THE EXTENT OF 120 MILLION OF INDIANS THAT THEY KILLED, JUST TO TAKE OVER THE LAND? THE TESTIMONY GOES ON, BUT THE ACTUAL EVENT THAT BEGAN THE CONFLICT TOOK PLACE AT A SYMBOLIC BARRICADE AMONG PINE TREES AT KANESETAKE NEAR OKA. (Announcer): THE MOHAWK WATCHED AND WAITED TODAY, MANNING THEIR 4-MONTH-OLD BARRICADE. WE'RE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA. NATIVE AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN CIACCIA ASKED THE MAYOR TO POSTPONE INDEFINITELY ANY PLANS TO BUILD ON LAND THE MOHAWKS CLAIM IS THEIRS. - WILL YOU ABANDON THE PROJECT? NO! IS THAT CLEAR? THE MAYOR WANTS PROVINCIAL POLICE TO REMOVE THE BARRIER. I SAID, WE'RE GIVING YOU THE CASE. HAVE SOMEBODY TO RESPECT THE LAW. THE WAY THEY'LL DO IT, IT'S NOT MY CONCERN. MOHAWKS ARE APPEALING THE INJUNCTION AND SHOW LITTLE SIGN OF BACKING DOWN. LET THEM COME. WE'LL HAVE A PARTY. PROVINCIAL POLICE HAVE NOT SAID THEY WILL ENFORCE THE INJUNCTION, BUT CONSIDERING THEIR CAUTIOUS ATTITUDE, THE CHANCES OF THEM TRYING TO REMOVE THE BARRIER SEEM RATHER SMALL. JOHN CURTIN, CBC NEWS, OKA. (Announcer): IT'S SUNNY, WITH SOME CLOUDS, TODAY, JULY 11 AND IT'S A WEDNESDAY. IT'S 19 DEGREES, HIGH OF 24. THE RECORD HIGH FOR THIS DAY IN 1987 WAS 32 DEGREES. JANET, ARE YOU THERE? - I AM HERE. - HOW'S IT GOING? - WE'VE GOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC PROBLEMS THIS MORNING. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST WAKING UP, THE MERCIER BRIDGE HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY KAHNAWAKE WARRIORS. THEY HAVE PUT UP BARRICADES, AND THEN PROVINCIAL POLICE, MONTREAL CITY POLICE... THE BRIDGE, AND ROADS LEADING TO IT, WERE BLOCKED WHEN WORD CAME FROM OKA. AN SQ SWAT TEAM HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THE SYMBOLIC BARRICADE IN THE PINES. (Announcer): GOOD MORNING. HERE IS THE 8:30 CBC NEWS. THE LONG-AWAITED CONFRONTATION BETWEEN NATIVES AND POLICE IN OKA HAS COME. - JOHN, WE HAVE TO GO TO IVAN SLOBAD, WHO'S OUT AT THE BLOCKADE IN OKA. IVAN'S ON THE LINE. HELLO, IVAN. HOW ARE YOU DOING? - I COULD BE BETTER. CAN YOU HEAR ANY OF THAT? - SOUNDS LIKE SHOTS. - THEY LAUNCHED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN OR A DOZEN CANISTERS OF TEARGAS. THERE'S SMOKE COVERING A 30 OR 40 SQUARE METRE AREA. IT'S BLOCKING OFF MY VIEW OF THE BULLDOZER THAT'S GOING TO MOVE THE BARRICADE. - IVAN, ARE THE WARRIORS PULLING BACK NOW? - EVERYBODY WAS. WE'RE MOVING CARS, CAMPS, PEOPLE. [ Shots ] - ARE THOSE SHOTS, IVAN? HELLO? THAT WAS IVAN SLOBAD, AT THE OKA BLOCKADE. TONIGHT ON THE NATIONAL: A DEADLY SHOOT-OUT AT OKA. COMPROMISES FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY AT THE G7 SUMMIT. AND ON THE JOURNAL, THE OKA STANDOFF. WHY A DISPUTE OVER A GOLF COURSE FLARED INTO A FATAL GUNFIGHT. THE NATIONAL, WITH PETER MANSBRIDGE. GOOD EVENING. IT WAS A BLOODY DAY IN OKA, QUEBEC, NEAR MONTREAL. PROVINCIAL POLICE STORMED THE BARRICADES THAT MOHAWKS HAD SET UP. TEARGAS, A HAIL OF BULLETS, AND A POLICEMAN WAS KILLED DURING THE BATTLE. A DISPUTE OVER A PIECE OF FOREST THE INDIANS CLAIM IS THEIRS WHICH TOWN COUNCIL WANTS TO BULLDOZE FOR A GOLF COURSE. - I'M TRYING TO GET BEHIND A TREE, AND THE TEARGAS IS COMING. THERE'S SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRE THAT APPEARS TO BE COMING FROM POLICE LINES. FEARING A 2nd RAID, WARRIORS NOW SET UP A BARRICADE ON THE HIGHWAY. THE OKA SIEGE HAS BEGUN. THE TOWN, ONCE FAMOUS FOR ITS ROBUST CHEESE, WOULD NOW BE KNOWN FOR ITS 9-HOLE GOLF COURSE. NO. EVERYONE HAS MAINTAINED CONTROL. EVERYONE IS FED UP WITH THIS BULLSHIT. DOWNRIVER FROM OKA, SUDDENLY THERE IS NEW INTEREST IN NATIVE PEOPLE. WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT THIS LAND WAS ONCE HOME OF PROUD INDIAN PEOPLE. THE RESERVE IS CALLED CAUGHNAWAGA, THE INDIANS CALL IT KAHNAWAKE. THEY ARE MOHAWK INDIANS BELONGING TO THE IROQUOIAN FAMILY... SOME JOURNALISTS HAVE HEARD OF LOUIS HALL OF KAHNAWAKE. YEARS BACK, HE WROTE "REBUILDING THE IROQUOIS CONFEDERACY." THE MEDIA HOPE HE WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE WARRIORS PORTRAYED IN HIS MANIFESTO. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BLAMED THE WARRIORS FOR THE CONFLICT. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TROUBLE BY NOW IF THEY HAD DONE ANYTHING REALLY... CRIMINAL. - A MAN WAS KILLED IN OKA, FOR EXAMPLE, LAST WEEK. - AND THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHO SHOT HIM. HE WAS WEARING A BULLET-PROOF VEST. SOMEBODY HAD TO BE CLOSE TO HIM TO SHOOT HIM WHERE THE 2 VESTS MEET. THAT'S WHERE HE WAS SHOT. MAYBE SOMEBODY STANDING RIGHT BESIDE HIM. THE POLICE ARE NOT LETTING ANYBODY KNOW IF THEY... MAYBE THEY WANT HIM DEAD, THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO DO IT, AND BLAME IT ON THE INDIANS... THEY BLAME EVERYTHING ON THE INDIANS. THE GREAT LAW OF PEACE, THE IROQUOIS CONSTITUTION, CALLS ON ALL MEN TO BECOME WARRIORS WHEN THE NATION IS THREATENED. THIS LAW HAS GOVERNED MOHAWKS FOR MORE THAN 1,000 YEARS. I'M TOO OLD TO BE A WARRIOR, FOR ONE THING. AND I CAN'T RUN FROM POINT A TO POINT B... FAST ENOUGH. THE FUNERAL OF CORPORAL MARCEL LEMAY. THEY REPRESENT POLICE ASSOCIATIONS FROM ACROSS CANADA, FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL CABINET MINISTERS, AND OTHER DIGNITARIES. ET SUREMENT COMME TU L'AURAIS SOUHAITE, CONNAISSANT TON SENS DU DEVOIR, LE GROUPE CONTINUERA SON TRAVAIL AVEC LE MEME PROFESSIONALISME, SANS ESPRIT DE VENGEANCE. NOUS NE TROUVERONS PAS DE REPONSE A NOS QUESTIONS DANS LA VENGEANCE, LES REPRESAILLES OU LA REVOLTE. [ Taps ] AT OKA, A MOHAWK WARRIOR FLAG IS HUNG AT HALF-MAST. THE SQ DENIED FIRING ANY SHOTS DURING THE RAID ON THE PINES. 2 DAYS LATER, OFFICIALS LEARN THE FATAL BULLET WAS A MILITARY 223. A NEWS BLACKOUT IS IMPOSED. ONE JOURNALIST, CURIOUS ENOUGH TO EXAMINE THE TREES AT OKA, REPORTED IN A US MILITARY MAGAZINE THAT NEARLY ALL THE SHOTS CAME FROM THE POLICE SIDE. INVESTIGATORS LATER ADMITTED THE SQ FIRED, BUT ONLY IN RETREAT. THEY WOULD ALSO SAY THE SQ DID NOT USE MILITARY SHELLS, BUT SOFT LEAD HOLLOW-TIP BULLETS THAT SOME CALL DUM-DUMS. DURING THE CRISIS, POLICE ASSOCIATIONS ACROSS CANADA PUBLISHED FULL-PAGE ADS IN NEWSPAPERS DECRYING THE MURDER OF CORPORAL LEMAY, AND DEMANDING THAT HIS AMBUSHERS BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. (Announcer): CHATEAUGUAY RESIDENTS SAW SOMETHING TODAY. BUT IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT. HUGE MOUNDS OF EARTH PUSHED ONTO HIGHWAY 138, A REINFORCEMENT TO THE MOHAWK BARRICADE BLOCKING ACCESS TO THE MERCIER BRIDGE. IF INDIANS WANT TO SUPPORT OKA, THEY JUST HAVE TO DRIVE THERE. NOT INVOLVE A CITY BEING LIKE PRISONERS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE... IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL. WITH FRUSTRATION MOUNTING, 1,100 PEOPLE SIGNED A PETITION DEMANDING THE ARMY INTERVENE. LAST NIGHT, FOR THE 2nd TIME IN A ROW, AN EFFIGY OF AN INDIAN WAS HANGED AND BURNED NEAR THE BARRICADE. THE CROWD CHEERED. BUT NOT EVERYONE SAYS THE MOHAWKS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRISIS. OKA'S MAYOR STARTED THIS! HE SHOULD REGULATE THE WHOLE PROBLEM! THE KAHNAWAKE BARRICADES CUT OFF ACCESS TO THE MERCIER BRIDGE. KAHNAWAKE RESIDENTS WHO WORK IN MONTREAL MUST ALSO ENDURE DETOURS AND DELAYS. THEY FEAR REPRISALS IF THEY GO BY ROAD. THEY FEEL SAFER CROSSING THE ST. LAWRENCE RIVER BY BOAT. - HAS THE SQ INTERFERED AT ALL? - THE SQ HAVE BEEN REALLY NICE. REALLY QUIET. THEY'RE OUT THERE. ONLOOKING... JUST WATCHING US FROM THE WATER ITSELF, AND MAKING SURE EVERYBODY'S GOT THE LIFE JACKETS ON. IT'S BEEN REALLY QUIET, AND THEY'VE BEEN COOL. FOR THE SQ, HOLIDAYS ARE ON HOLD. OVER THE SUMMER, THEY WILL PUT IN 2 MILLION HOURS OF OVERTIME. AS THE RING AROUND KAHNAWAKE CLOSES, THE RCMP AND THE SQ STEP UP RIVER PATROLS. THE ROADS ARE BLOCKED, AND THE AIRSPACE IS OFF LIMITS. COMMUNICATION, EVEN BY LETTER, IS SUSPECT. THE PEACEKEEPERS, KAHNAWAKE'S POLICE FORCE, HAVE A NEW ASSIGNMENT. THEY DRIVE TO THE BARRICADE, THE SQ CHECK THE MAIL. THIS MORNING, THEY ALLOWED IT TO COME TO OUR BARRICADE. THE 2 PREVIOUS TIMES, THE EXCHANGE WAS MADE ON THE SQ SIDE. KAHNAWAKE IS NOW UNDER A FORM OF MEDIEVAL SIEGE. THE STORE SHELVES ARE EMPTY. THE TOWN SETS UP A FOOD BANK. WE APPEALED TO THE PEOPLE TO BRING IN ANY EXTRA FOOD, AND OTHERS CAME IN TO GET IT. MOHAWKS NOW MAKE AN APPEAL TO THE RED CROSS AND THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. OH, GREAT SPIRIT, WHOSE VOICE I HEAR IN THE WINDS, HEAR ME. I COME BEFORE YOU. I AM SMALL AND WEAK. I NEED YOUR STRENGTH AND WISDOM. LET ME WALK IN BEAUTY, AND MAKE MY EYES EVER BEHOLD THE SUNSET. MAKE MY HANDS RESPECT THE THINGS YOU HAVE MADE. MY EARS SHARP TO HEAR YOU. MAKE ME EVER READY TO COME TO YOU WITH CLEAN HANDS AND STRAIGHT EYES SO WHEN LIFE FADES, MY SPIRIT MAY COME TO YOU WITHOUT SHAME. SO IF THEY DON'T LEAVE, THERE WILL BE NO MORE INDIANS? YOU'LL GET RID OF US? I'M LISTENING... MM-HMM, I'M LISTENING. PEACEKEEPERS HAVE VERIFIED THAT THE SQ CLOSED THE OUTSIDE BARRICADES ON ROUTE 207 FOR OUR SAFETY. THERE IS A GROUP OF DEMONSTRATORS THREATENING PEOPLE WHO LEAVE OR TRY TO ENTER. THE GOLDEN AGE CLUB WILL BE OPEN FOR RADIO BINGO FOR ANYONE WHOSE TELEPHONE IS OUT. MANY ARE IN TOWN. SO ROUTE 207 IS CLOSED FOR THE TIME BEING FOR OUR OWN SAFETY. 5 MINUTES AFTER 12, TIME FOR MORE MUSIC. IT'S MORNING RUSH HOUR AND THE CHAMPLAIN BRIDGE IS HALF-EMPTY. THERE'S CHAOS ON HIGHWAY 15. CARS ARE CRAWLING ON THE 132. PEOPLE IN MASKS ARE DRIVING. MY BRIDGE IS CLOSED FOR ABOUT 4 WEEKS. THAT'S OUR ANSWER TO Mr. BOURASSA, THE PEOPLE OF CHATEAUGUAY ARE TIRED OF THAT. WE DO HAVE SOME MESSAGES. THE WEDDING OF BURGESS DIABO AND CHERYL IS CANCELLED. THE INDIAN WAY SCHOOL WILL HAVE REGISTRATION ON SEPT. 10th. EVERY TIME ANYTHING HAPPENS, IT'S THE INDIANS THAT DONE IT. ALL THIS TIME, IN CHATEAUGUAY, ALL THAT RUMPUS WAS ALL STARTED BY THE FRENCH PEOPLE AND THE SQ. WHEN THEY LEAVE AT NIGHT WITH THE UNIFORMS, THEY COME BACK AT NIGHT WITHOUT UNIFORMS. THEY'RE DOING ALL THAT TROUBLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SO WE KEEP THIS IN MIND- THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS VERY, VERY ROTTEN, QUEBEC, AT LEAST. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LIE, JUST LIKE PINOCCHIO... YOUR NOSE IS GETTING LONGER AND LONGER. YOU LOOK AT BOURASSA: HIS NOSE IS ABOUT A FOOT LONG NOW. THE QUEBEC PREMIER ISSUES A 48-HOUR ULTIMATUM AND REQUESTS THE ARMY. (Announcer): IN OTHER NEWS, IRAQ HAS ANNEXED KUWAIT. REPORTS OF ATROCITIES IN KUWAIT HAVE KAHNAWAKE RESIDENTS EVEN MORE ON EDGE. I HAVE TWO OLDER SONS, AGE 6 AND 8 AND THEY ARE FORBIDDEN TO WATCH THE NEWS. TWICE THEY WATCHED AND IT WAS REALLY TRAUMATIC FOR THEM, 'CAUSE THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS EVEN HARDER FOR ME TO EXPLAIN TO THEM ALL PEOPLE AREN'T LIKE THAT. MY 8-YEAR-OLD WAS TERRIFIED WHEN HE SAW AN EFFIGY OF A MOHAWK WARRIOR BURNED AT THE STAKE. TO HIM, THAT REPRESENTED HIS FATHER, GRANDFATHER AND UNCLES. HE WAS REALLY TERRIFIED. I HAD TO TRY AND EXPLAIN TO HIM WHY ARE THE PEOPLE SAYING GO AHEAD AND LET THE ARMY GO IN AND KILL THEM ALL. SINCE THEN, BOTH OF OUR SONS NO LONGER WATCH THE NEWS, BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN A TOLL ON THEM, AND IT'S EVEN HARDER FOR ME TO TRY AND EXPLAIN IT. I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM ONE DAY. (Announcer): PROGRAMS NORMALLY SEEN AT THIS TIME HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR RESCHEDULED FOR THE FOLLOWING CBC NEWS SPECIAL. THE PRIME MINISTER WILL MAKE A STATEMENT IN A FEW MINUTES CONCERNING THE MOHAWK CRISIS AND PERHAPS THE PERSIAN GULF. (Mulroney): THE GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC, WITH OUR SUPPORT, HAS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THE PUBLIC SECURITY AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE ISSUES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION BUT HAS BEEN, AS YOU KNOW, UNSUCCESSFUL. THE PREMIER OF QUEBEC HAS REQUESTED THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CANADIAN ARMED FORCES IN ORDER TO TRY TO PUT AN END TO THE CONFRONTATION. THE PRIME MINISTER NAMES A JUDGE TO PRESIDE OVER THE SIGNING OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND MOHAWKS. PRECONDITIONS INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS. NEGOTIATIONS WOULD THEN START. UNTIL THEN, THE ARMY STAYS FAR AWAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT WILL DECIDE. WE IN NORTH AMERICA HAVE CENTURIES NOW OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF CANADA AND THE US, AND THEY'VE MASSACRED MANY OF OUR PEOPLE... OUR NUMBERS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT SMALLER. WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE TREMENDOUS INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE THAT'S BEEN PUT ON THEM WILL PREVAIL, THAT REASON WILL PREVAIL, THAT THEY WILL, LIKE US, SEEK A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION, AND THAT THEY WILL UNDERSTAND, FINALLY, THAT THIS IS OUR LAND, THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND OUR LAND. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE HAPPENS. THE SIGNING TOOK PLACE NOT FAR FROM WHERE SQ CORPORAL MARCEL LEMAY WAS SHOT DEAD DURING A FAILED POLICE RAID ON MOHAWK BARRICADES. TODAY IS A BREAKTHROUGH. WE'VE AGREED ON PRECONDITIONS. NOW WE CAN DISCUSS DISMANTLING THE BARRICADES. THE SAME DAY, THIS ONE EVENT CHANGES EVERYTHING. DEMONSTRATORS FROM CHATEAUGUAY TRY TO SEIZE THEIR OWN BRIDGE, A DRAWBRIDGE WHICH SPANS THE ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY UPRIVER FROM KAHNAWAKE. THEIR PLAN WAS TO HOLD THIS BRIDGE AT ST.LOUIS DE GONSAGUES UNTIL MOHAWKS ARE DISLODGED FROM THE MERCIER BRIDGE. [ Drums ] THAT NIGHT IN CHATEAUGUAY, THE BLOODIEST RIOTS OF THE SUMMER, A REACTION TO THE DRAWBRIDGE CONFRONTATION. THE NEXT NIGHT THE CROWDS TAKE ON THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE. A POPULATION OUT OF CONTROL. MOHAWK WARRIORS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRICADES SIMPLY WATCH. THE QUEBEC PREMIER ONCE AGAIN CALLS THE ARMY. COULD THEY PLEASE MAKE THEIR PRESENCE FELT BY MOVING INTO THE AREA. THE PROBLEM NOW IS NOT MOHAWKS, IT IS THE MOB. THE ARMY HAS MOVED TO ST-REMI, QUEBEC, WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF BOTH KAHNAWAKE AND CHATEAUGUAY. THE TROOPS HAVE COME FROM AS FAR AS GAGETOWN, NB, HOME OF THE ROYAL CANADIAN REGIMENT, CANADA'S OLDEST. THEIR FIRST ACTION WAS AGAINST LOUIS RIEL AND THE METIS, OF FRENCH AND INDIAN DESCENT. THE ISSUE THEN WAS ALSO SOVEREIGNTY. THESE TROOPS ARE FROM VALCARTIER, QUEBEC, THE ROYAL 22nd, OR VAN DOOZ, THE ELITE FRENCH- CANADIAN REGIMENT. JUST AS NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN, THE QUEBEC PREMIER ASKS THE ARMY TO RELIEVE POLICE AT THE CHATEAUGUAY BARRICADES. TU CLOUES TA PANCARTE APRES CA. TU LA METS HAUTE. ON VA LA TROUVER, CE N'EST PAS UN PROBLEME. AT THE MONTREAL SIDE OF THE MERCIER BRIDGE, THE MOBS HAVE COME OVER FROM CHATEAUGUAY WHERE THE ARMY HAS MOVED IN. HERE, THE POLICE ARE STILL IN CHARGE, AT LEAST OFFICIALLY. IL FAUT QU'ELLE SOIT HAUTE POUR QUE LE MONDE LA VOIE. APPUIE-LA COMME IL FAUT, LA. THE DEMONSTRATORS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED ON THE BRIDGE. HERE THEY CAN MONITOR ANYTHING COMING OUT OF KAHNAWAKE. LAISSEZ FAIRE, C'EST FINI, LAISSEZ-LES PASSER. ONLY AMBULANCES CROSSED THE BRIDGE, AND EVERY PATIENT IS EXAMINED. AUCUNE AMBULANCE VA PASSER. EVERYBODY IS WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. DAYS EARLIER, THE MOHAWK NEGOTIATING TEAM WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE. THE GOVERNMENT SIDE PULLED OUT. THE PM LABELS THEIR DEMANDS BIZARRE. NOW THE FEDERAL MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS SAYS THE CALL FOR TALKS ON SOVEREIGNTY IS UNACCEPTABLE; IT WOULD LEAD TO THE BALKANIZATION OF CANADA. PREMIER BOURASSA ISSUES A 2nd 48-HOUR ULTIMATUM: SURRENDER, OR THE ARMY, THE LAST RESORT, WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST. THE NEXT DAY, THE CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER CALLS THE MOHAWK WARRIORS A BAND OF TERRORISTS. FEAR HAS TURNED TO PANIC. HUNDREDS OF KAHNAWAKE RESIDENTS EVACUATE. THE SAFEST ROUTE IS OVER THE WATER TO AN UNDISCOVERED SITE. EACH PERSON ARRIVING HAS BEEN LISTED FOR POLICE. WHY ARE THEY BEING CHECKED? WHO TOLD YOU? IS IT A FEDERAL OR PROVINCIAL STATEMENT THAT HAS MADE THIS PARK OFF LIMITS? - WE MADE OUR PERIMETER. - I CAN'T EXPRESS MY OPINION NOW? I CAN TAKE A BOX AND TALK. IT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY. (Radio): ... AND PREMIER BOURASSA... THAT HAS CHANGED... THE POSITIONS IN WHICH THE ARMY MUST CARRY OUT ITS ORDERS... THEY ARE NOW ENTERING A MILITARY OPERATION. THE ARMY ACTION, CODE NAME OPERATION DISMANTLEMENT, IS ON. THE QUEBEC PREMIER HAS ORDERED THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TO WITHDRAW. A FULL BRIGADE IS MOBILIZED. CF5 AIRCRAFT, ARMY HELICOPTERS AND A GUNBOAT ARE STANDING BY TO PROVIDE COVER. ONE JOURNALIST WOULD DESCRIBE THE SCENE BEST: WE ARE ABOUT TO BECOME A NATION WHICH, FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A POTENTIAL MASSACRE AND A LONG DRIVE TO WORK, CHOSE THE MASSACRE. LATER THAT DAY, WOMEN WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY AND INFIRM ARE BEING EVACUATED ACROSS THE MERCIER BRIDGE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU JUST SEE ROCKS FLYING, AND AT FIRST, THEY WERE NOT STOPPING THESE PEOPLE. I GUESS IT GOT OUT OF HAND, AND THEN FINALLY THEY STARTED... THEY DIDN'T CARE WHO IT WAS. THEY WERE JUST DESTINED TO GET THESE INDIANS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WANTED TO DO... - DID YOU EXPECT THAT? - NO. THEY TOLD US EVERYTHING WAS UNDER CONTROL. THERE WOULD BE MANY POLICEMEN. WE WERE GONNA GO THROUGH PEACEFULLY, AND THAT WAS IT. WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS IF THEY KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN, AS SOON AS THESE PEOPLE CAME, THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD US, "TURN AROUND AND GO BACK." INSTEAD, IT WAS LIKE, "NO, JUST GO, GO, GO." THESE PEOPLE HAD NO PITY FOR ANYBODY, THAT'S FOR SURE. AN ELDERLY MAN SUFFERS A HEART ATTACK. THE POLICE DON'T MAKE A SINGLE ARREST. A WEEK LATER, HIS FRIENDS BURY HIM. ARMSTRONG, JOSEPH, AT KAHNAWAKE ON SEPT. 2nd, AGE 71 YEARS, BELOVED HUSBAND OF NANCY MONTOUR, DEAR FATHER OF TINA, ROGER DIABO, THOMAS, COLLEEN JACOBS, AND 4 GRANDCHILDREN, CHRISTINE, KRISTEN, BLAIR, HANNAH. THE STONING OF MOHAWKS SHOCKED CANADA AND THE WORLD. THE CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER, FROM HIS MEECH LAKE RETREAT, WOULD CALL THE EVENT DEPLORABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE: "CANADA, WITH ALL OF ITS GOOD FORTUNE, IS NOT FREE "FROM TRACES OF RACISM. "RACISM AT ANY TIME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS AN EVIL." IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. [ Shot ] AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING, WE WILL REMEMBER THEM. [ Bagpipes ] IS THERE ANY REASON FOR PEOPLE TO STAND TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY? DO THEY NEED TO FIGHT A COMMON ENEMY TO BE ABLE TO LIVE TOGETHER? CANADA NEVER HAD A REVOLUTION. THE COUNTRY WAS BORN OUT OF COMPROMISE. THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW WARS TO BE REMEMBERED, BUT EVEN THOSE TESTED CANADIAN UNITY. IT WAS SAID THE 20th CENTURY BELONGS TO CANADA. WILL A CANADA EVEN EXIST IN THE 21st? THIS LEGION BRANCH HAS THE LARGEST ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN CANADA. SOON, THEIR NUMBERS WILL INCREASE WHEN 30 VOLUNTEERS RETURN HOME AFTER SERVING IN THE PERSIAN GULF. THE... POLITICIANS LOOK AT US LIKE HORSE MANURE UNDER YOUR FOOT. AND I DON'T THINK WE DESERVE THAT EITHER. BECAUSE ALL THIS VAST COUNTRY HERE BELONGED TO US AT ONE TIME. AND TO PROTECT OUR LITTLE PLACE WHERE WE DWELL NOWADAYS, LIKE THE SIZE OF A POSTAGE STAMP. AND THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET THAT OUT FROM UNDER US. CA VA, MAIS JE NE SAIS PAS COMMENT CA VA FONCTIONNER, JE VOUS DIS QUE DANS 5 MINUTES, LE MINISTRE VA VENIR ICI, VOUS VOUS ORGANISEZ AVEC LES CAMERAS. DORVAL HILTON. THE 48 HOURS ARE UP. INFORMAL TALKS HAVE BEEN GOING ON NON-STOP. QUEBEC NATIVE AFFAIRS MINISTER, JOHN CIACCIA: WE HAVE AGREED ON MANY ELEMENTS AND WE WILL NOW CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS LATER THIS EVENING. CIACCIA HAD BEEN HOPING FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION, EVEN THOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT HAD OFFICIALLY PULLED OUT. THE GROUP ALMOST REACHES AN AGREEMENT, THEN THE FEDERAL DELEGATE AT THESE TALKS SHOCKS EVERYONE WHEN HE ANNOUNCES HE HAS NO MANDATE. I CAN'T MAKE ANY COMMENTS ON THE MILITARY ACTION. THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING TO THE MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS. THE TALKS HAVE BECOME MEANINGLESS. CIACCIA HAS BEEN UNDERMINED. I THINK THAT MATTERS OF THAT NATURE... BETTER BE LEFT TO THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND WE WILL SEE THE CONTENTS IF AND WHEN WE GET A FINAL AGREEMENT. MERCI BEAUCOUP. THE MOHAWKS OF KANESETAKE, I JUST... GERRY PELLETIER. GERRY WHAT? PELLETIER. I WILL LET CHIEF JOE NORTON SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE KAHNAWAKE SITUATION, BUT SO FAR DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING IN A POSITIVE MANNER. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A PRESS CONFERENCE BEING HELD IN KAHNAWAKE WITH REGARD TO THE OPENING OF HIGHWAY 132, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, 132, AND MERCIER BRIDGE. AT LEAST THE PRELIMINARY WORK ON THAT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. THEY'RE HOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE. WITH THAT TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND... THE ARMY AND WARRIORS AT KAHNAWAKE ARE ARRANGING FOR A PEACEFUL RE-OPENING OF THE MERCIER BRIDGE. ... DOES AWAY WITH ANY ARMED INVASION, OR ANY KIND OF SITUATION, CONFLICT OR ANYTHING. JUST AS A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT SEEMS AT HAND, THE QUEBEC PREMIER ISSUES A TERSE STATEMENT. TALKING IS OFF FOR GOOD. (Announcer): THE 2nd BATTALION OF THE VAN DOOZ HIT THE ROAD. THEIR PREDECESSORS FOUGHT GREAT BATTLES THIS CENTURY NOW, A SHOWDOWN AT A GOLF COURSE. WHEN THE ARMY COMES IN TO PLAY, IT'S NOT THE TINKER TOYS GAME. IT'S SERIOUS. IT MEANS SOCIETY HAS RESORTED TO THAT MEANS OF ACTION BECAUSE OTHERS HAD BEEN MORE OR LESS EXHAUSTED. SOCIETY, IT SEEMS, IS NOT INTERESTED IN SETTLEMENTS, BUT WANTS A SHOW OF FORCE. NATIVES ARE TAKEN BY SURPRISE. SOME FEEL IT'S REVENGE BECAUSE THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD WAS BLOCKED BY AN INDIAN. BUT THE ESTABLISHED ORDER IS ALSO FACED WITH WIDESPREAD DISCONTENT. THE QUEBEC SOVEREIGNTY MOVEMENT IS ON THE RISE AGAIN. THE RULING FEDERAL CONSERVATIVES ARE LOW IN POPULARITY. THEIR GOVERNMENTS MUST SHOW THE ELECTORATE THAT THEY HAVE THE SITUATION IN HAND. THE PUBLIC IS WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, BUT NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THE BRIDGE THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR TO OPEN IS STILL CLOSED. IT MAY BE A WEEK OR MORE BEFORE IT OPENS, NOBODY KNOWS. THE EVENT THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR IS A LETDOWN. DESPITE ALL THE ARMED BUILDUP, THE POSTURING, THE THREATS, THERE IS NO PITCHED BATTLE TO ENTERTAIN THE CROWDS- ONLY GENERAL POLICING. DISMANTLING OF BARRICADES AND FILLING OF TANK TRAPS IS AS EXCITING AS IT GETS. THE WORK WILL TAKE DAYS. THERE WERE OTHER DETAILS. SOMEONE HAD TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HUNDREDS OF WARRIORS SUPPOSEDLY IN KAHNAWAKE. ONLY A FEW ARE SEEN DURING THE CLEANUP. HOW COULD THEY VANISH? NOBODY IS QUITE SURE WHERE THE RUMOURS STARTED. 15 AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFFS AND LANDINGS, SPIRITING OFF WARRIORS AND ARMS, NO EYEWITNESSES EVER SURFACED. NOR WAS THERE ANY TRACE OF THE WARRIOR SUBMARINE THAT THE SQ WAS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR. THE WOMEN OF KAHNAWAKE BECOME THE ONLY VOICE FOR THE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE FEW MEN AROUND. ANY ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE ON A WANTED LIST. THIS IS THE SUMMER'S LARGEST AND MOST SIGNIFICANT DEMONSTRATION AND THE PRESS CAN'T GET HERE TO WITNESS IT. THE NEXT DAY, THE PRESS IS BROUGHT IN BY BOAT. - WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AT THE MOHAWK NATION OFFICE? - I'M ONE OF THE WORKERS. - ARE YOU CONCERNED WITH WHAT HAPPENED TODAY AT THE ST. CATHERINE BARRICADE? - YEAH, MY SISTER AND HER 2 CHILDREN WERE ATTACKED THERE LAST NIGHT, WITH SQ STANDING BY, LETTING MY 5-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW GET SCARED HALF TO DEATH. THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. THE SQ IS NO BETTER THAN THE NAZIS HITLER HAD. THIS IS A POLICE STATE, THEY'VE GOT NO CONSIDERATION, NOT EVEN FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE. IF I HAD MY WAY, THE SQ WOULD BE EXTERMINATED. - HOW COME WHITES ARE SAYING THE SAME THING AGAINST THE SQ? - EVERY TIME WE TRY TO STAND UP FOR OURSELVES, WE'RE ARRESTED. IF 20 CITIZENS FROM THE OUTSIDE ATTACK ONE OF US, THEY'RE GONNA ARREST US. LAST NIGHT, ASK MY NEPHEW AND NIECE HOW THEY FELT WHEN 20 RESIDENTS OUTSIDE OF ST. CATHERINE WERE NOT STOPPED BY THE SQ WHEN THEY TRIED TO BUST WINDOWS, AND TURN OVER THE CAR. THE SQ DID NOT MAKE A MOVE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. - WHAT ABOUT THE ARMY? - FINALLY, THE ARMY SAW IT AND JUST TOLD MY SISTER TO COME THROUGH. AND THIS IS AFTER ALL THE CONDITIONS WERE MET OF OUR PEOPLE OVER HERE. WE'RE OPENING THE ROADS, WE'LL OPEN THE BRIDGE, SO NOW THEY'RE LETTING THE PEOPLE JUST GO CRAZY. THEY STILL WANT BLOODSHED IN KANESETAKE. - THE ARMY GAVE YOU SOME FOOD YESTERDAY NIGHT. - THE ARMY DIDN'T GET US FOOD. THEY HELPED US TO BRING IN SOME FOOD SAFELY. A MAN WAS STOPPED WITH 2 LOAVES OF BREAD AND MILK BY THE SQ, SAYING YOU CAN'T BRING FOOD INTO KAHNAWAKE. - WE CAN GO BACK NOW BY BUS? - I WILL ARRANGE IT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WISH. - WE WISH... IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT YOU WHITE PEOPLE GOT TOGETHER AND FIRED MULRONEY AND BOURASSA. THEY CANNOT RUN THE COUNTRY, THEY CAN'T RUN IN PEACE. YOU WHITE PEOPLE... YOU'RE GONNA BE NEXT. THIS IS LIKE HITLER. AND IT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU WHITE PEOPLE. YOU'RE ALREADY FIGHTING ON THE OUTSIDE. YOU HAVE A DARK SKIN, THEY'LL CATCH YOU AND THEY'RE GONNA BEAT YOU UP AND KILL YOU. AND YOU LOOK LIKE INDIANS YOURSELF. ALL SUMMER THERE WERE RUMOURS ABOUT SABOTAGE OF THE BRIDGE. OLD CAR FLARES COVERED IN COBWEBS ARE THE ONLY THINGS RECOVERED. TIMES HAVE CHANGED. THE MERCIER BRIDGE, BUILT BY MOHAWKS, WAS NAMED AFTER HONORE MERCIER, AN ALMOST FORGOTTEN PREMIER OF QUEBEC, AN HONORARY CHIEF OF KAHNAWAKE. HIS GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER WOULD WRITE A LETTER TO A NEWSPAPER TO DENOUNCE THE USE OF THE ARMY AGAINST MOHAWKS. IS INSPECTION COMPLETE? I DON'T THINK SO... SOME OF MY MEN ARE DOING ANOTHER PART OF THE BRIDGE. WE COMPLETED A PORTION OF IT. WE'RE WORKING JUST ON THE FEDERAL PORTION OF THE BRIDGE. SOMEBODY ELSE IS WORKING ON THE PROVINCIAL. BEFORE THE BLOCKADE, THE BRIDGE WAS UNDER REPAIR AND ON THE MONTREAL SIDE, ACCESS ROADS WERE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. LITTLE WORK WAS DONE DURING THE STANDOFF. COMMUTERS WHO HAVE WAITED ALL SUMMER FOR THE BLOCKADES TO BE LIFTED WILL NOW HAVE THEIR PATIENCE TESTED. THE ROADS DEPARTMENT WILL SET UP NEW BARRICADES. TRAFFIC WILL BE DOWN TO SINGLE LANES. IN KAHNAWAKE, THE WOMEN DEMONSTRATE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE OKA PINES. THEY HAVE BLOCKED THE HIGHWAY TO THE MERCIER BRIDGE. WE FEEL THIS IS NOW OUR TIME TO POINT OUT TO THE COUNTRY, THE WORLD, THAT THE WOMEN IN KAHNAWAKE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING A POINT, ABOUT OUR SUPPORT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE, TO SUPPORT OUR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN KANESETAKE. I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF FIRST, IF THERE'S BLOODSHED IN KANESETAKE, MY SPIRIT WILL DIE. IT'S NOT COME ACROSS ENOUGH THAT WE BROUGHT UP THOSE MEN TO DO WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE ARMY HAS ASKED TO CROSS THIS POINT, BUT THE WOMEN REFUSE AND DECIDE TO SPEND THE NIGHT. THE ARMY HAD ONLY NEGOTIATED WITH THE MEN. NOW THEY REALIZE THAT THE WOMEN ARE A REAL POLITICAL FORCE IN THE COMMUNITY. THE NEXT DAY THE ARMY HOLDS NEW POSITIONS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN. THERE IS NO WAY IN OR OUT EXCEPT PAST THESE CHECKPOINTS. THEY POSITIONED TANKS, GUNS AIMING AT HOMES, A HOUSE OVER THERE HAS A WOMAN AND CHILD IN IT. THE ARMY'S ONLY MANDATE WAS TO REMOVE THE BARRICADES AND REOPEN THE BRIDGE. NOW THEY ARE GIVEN A NEW MISSION. THAT EVENING, THE ARMY COVERS AS THE SQ RAIDS THE LONGHOUSE, THE SPIRITUAL CENTRE OF TRADITIONAL MOHAWKS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE THAT THE SQ SETS FOOT IN KAHNAWAKE. - CAN YOU TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON? - WELL, WE'VE JUST BEEN INVADED BY THE ARMY. ABOUT 40 PCs ALL ARMED, AND SQ IS IN THE LONGHOUSE. THEY HIT WOMEN AND CHILDREN. - ARE THE SQ-- - IN THE LONGHOUSE. THEY'RE WITH GRAND CHIEF JOE NORTON AND BILLY TWO RIVERS. - IS IT TRUE THAT THE WOMEN HIT THE SOLDIERS? - MA'AM, NO COMMENT ON IF THE WOMEN HIT US OR WE HIT THE WOMEN. ONCE THE PRESS IS ALLOWED IN THERE WILL BE SPOKESPERSONS THERE THAT WILL HELP YOU. THE SEARCH WAS EFFECTED UNDER A LEGAL SEARCH WARRANT BY THE SQ. THE MILITARY PROVIDED THE CORDON AND PROTECTION FOR THE SURETE SO THEY COULD SEARCH WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. A NUMBER OF ARMS AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT WERE FOUND, INCLUDING A 50-CALIBRE BERETTA MACHINE GUN, A RANGE OF 1,500 m, WHICH CAN PENETRATE ANY AND ALL OF THE VEHICLES UNDER MY COMMAND. WHEN WE APPROACHED TO CONDUCT OUR CORDON, THERE WERE NUMEROUS WOMEN ON THE SPOT BLOCKING THE ROUTE TO THE LONGHOUSE. - THEY WERE INJURED? ONE LADY DID REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE, WAS TAKEN AWAY IN AMBULANCE. THAT PARTICULAR LADY, PRIOR TO BEING INJURED, HAD USED HER KNEE IN A VERY PRIVATE PART OF A SOLDIER AND HAD ATTEMPTED TO TAKE HIS WEAPON. THE SOLDIER HAD TO USE FORCE TO KEEP CONTROL OF HIS WEAPON. THESE GENTLEMEN DON'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS. THEY HAVE BEEN DISARMED AND CHARGED FOR CARRYING THEIR SERVICE REVOLVERS. THE CHIEF OF THE PEACEKEEPERS AND HIS DEPUTY APPEAR IN COURT. THEIR LAWYER ANNOUNCES THE JUDGE ISN'T PREPARED TO HEAR THE CASE. THE PEACEKEEPERS IN KAHNAWAKE WILL CARRY ARMS AND DO THEIR JOBS AS PEACE OFFICERS AS THEY ARE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? - WHO INSTITUTED THE ORDER TO PICK OUR MEN UP? - THE DECISION TO LAY CHARGES-- TO APPREHEND THE 2 PEACEKEEPERS WAS MADE BY THE PROVINCIAL POLICE. THE BALL'S BEEN BOUNCED BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE POLICE. THE POLICE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO THE ARMY. IT IS A VERY POOR DECISION, A BAD EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS SUMMER AND FALL, IT WAS A BAD EXERCISE OF DISCRETION BY THE PROVINCIAL POLICE TO PURSUE THIS MATTER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? THANK YOU. THE CHARGES ARE NEVER PURSUED. BUT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WOULD STILL TRY TO TAKE OVER POLICING OF NATIVE COMMUNITIES. MEANWHILE, THE SUPER BINGO HALL, WHICH HAS BEEN CLOSED ALL SUMMER, HAS BEEN DEALT ANOTHER BLOW. THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY IT'S A MILITARY OPERATION. BUT THEN EVERY TIME THE SQ GO TO THE COURTS THEY GET AN INJUNCTION TO BREAK THE DOORS DOWN ON PEOPLE'S HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT THEY STATE THAT IT'S A POLICE OPERATION IN THAT ASPECT. THE ONLY THING THEY DO IS... PROTECT THE SQ, THE ARMY WHEN THEY COME HERE. - THEY DON'T HAVE A WARRANT? - EVERY TIME THEY INTIMIDATE US WE MUST BOW DOWN. - ARE THEY INTIMIDATING ANYBODY? - DO THEY HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT? YOU DON'T KNOW? I'M ASKING YOU. - I DON'T KNOW. - UNDER CIVIL LAW THEY MUST HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT. YOUS DON'T KNOW. GIVE US SOME ANSWERS THEN. - I'M JUST ASKING YOU NICE, KIRK... EVERYONE IS ON EDGE. NOBODY KNOWS WHEN THE NEXT RAID WILL COME. - I DON'T WANT PROBLEMS HERE. - I UNDERSTAND. - HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. EXPLAIN IT TO HIM. THERE WAS A SEARCH WARRANT WHICH INCLUDED SUSPICION OF ARMS, VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF ARMS AND MUNITIONS. - WHO'S CONDUCTING IT, THE ARMY? - THE ARMY CONDUCTED THE CORDON. SECURING THE OUTSIDE PORTION. THE SQ ARE DOING THE INSIDE SEARCH. - WE STAY OUTSIDE THE PERIMITER? - YOU CAN FILM ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE CORDON. BUT DURING THE SEARCH, NO ONE IS ALLOWED INSIDE. - OKAY, THANKS VERY MUCH. THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY CONTINUES EVERY DAY. NO ARMS ARE FOUND INSIDE. CARTONS OF CIGARETTES AND SOFT DRINKS ARE SEIZED FROM THIS OLD ROADSIDE FLEA MARKET. - SO HOW DO THEY GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR KAHNAWAKE TERRITORY? - ACCORDING TO THEIR LAWS, THEY SAY THE PROVINCIAL CRIMINAL CODE APPLIES OVER ALL LANDS IN QUEBEC. I'LL TELL THEM TO GET OUT RIGHT NOW, THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY, IT BELONGS TO MY GRANDMOTHER. - ARE YOU THE OWNER OF THE... - YEAH, I OWN KAHNAWAKE. I'M THE OWNER. - YOU SPEAK FRENCH? - YEAH. - OUI? POUVEZ-VOUS ME DIRE CE QUI ARRIVE... - LES CHRISTS ICI! ... THERE WAS NOTHING SEIZED. WHAT DID THEY WALK AWAY WITH? CIGARETTES. IF YOU WANT WEAPONS, LOOK, THERE'S A WEAPON RIGHT THERE. THE ONLY WEAPONS WE HAVE, MY ONLY WEAPON IS THIS, MY BRAIN, MY MOUTH. THIS IS JUST WHERE THEY KILLED DAVID CROSS. THE SQ, THEY CAME IN, THEY KILLED HIM OVER THERE, UNPROVOKED... SHOT HIM 5 TIMES. AND THIS IS WHO YOU'RE PROTECTING. THEY SHOT DAVID CROSS DEAD OVER A TRAFFIC VIOLATION 10 YEARS AGO. THE COMMUNITY HAS NOT FORGOTTEN. THE ISSUE REMAINS: WHO HAS JURISDICTION OVER NATIVE LANDS? QUEBEC OR OTTAWA? OR THE NATIVE PEOPLE THEMSELVES? CAN GOVERNMENTS TOLERATE A NATION WITHIN A NATION? NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRUSHED BEFORE IN THEIR ATTEMPT AT SOVEREIGNTY. LOUIS RIEL WAS HANGED FOR TRYING. THIS WAS THE SUMMER WHEN SOVEREIGNTY BECAME THE MAJOR CONCERN OF CANADA, NOT JUST NATIVE SOVEREIGNTY BUT QUEBEC SOVEREIGNTY AND CANADA'S SURVIVAL. AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED, THE OCCUPATION OF KAHNAWAKE IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL. THE GOVERNMENT OR THE MILITARY IS JUST SERVING AS A PUPPET FOR THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF THE PROVINCE, ESPECIALLY BOURASSA. I THINK HE'S PREPARING THE GROUND WORK FOR EVENTUAL SEPARATION OF QUEBEC, AND HE WANTS TO CRUSH THE... HE DOESN'T WANT AN INDIAN PROBLEM INVOLVED WITH THE SEPARATION OF QUEBEC. I THINK THAT HE HAS GONE WELL BEYOND THE... I GUESS, THE AREA OF PUBLIC SECURITY, AND THE ARMY IS MERELY A PUPPET OF THE SQ. - SO THE SQ COMMANDS THE ARMY. THAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION. - THE ILLEGALITY THERE IS THAT A NATIONAL ARMY IS PUT IN THE HANDS OF A PROVINCIAL JURISDICTION, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG. THERE'S NO PARLIAMENTARY CONSENT, THERE'S NO NATIONAL CONSENT, AND FOR ANY ARMY TO BE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF THE LIKES OF BOURASSA IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS. THE MILITARY OVER HERE ARE JUST ESCORTING THE SQ TO GO AND DO WHATEVER THEY WISH IN THE INDIAN COMMUNITY. AND I JUST FEEL THAT IT'S VERY, VERY DANGEROUS AND INDIAN PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK CAREFULLY. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO KAHNAWAKE COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. - YOU SPEAK ENGLISH? - YEAH. - I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING NOW, I'M A CONTRACTOR, 3 BUILDINGS IN TOWN, 2 ON THE HIGHWAY HERE, SO I'M HERE A LOT. SO LOOK NOW, BUT YOU WON'T CHECK ME EVERY TIME. - YEAH, AFTER I SEE YOU... - I'M A MEDICAL TECHNICIAN WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. SO I'M TELLING YOU NOW, 'CAUSE DURING THE DAY I'M IN AND OUT HERE 7, 8 TIMES A DAY, 25 MEN WORKING TOTAL, 3 BUILDINGS THERE, 2 HERE. - FOR COMPLAINTS, SPEAK TO THE POLICE. NOT TO ME. - WHICH POLICE? - SQ OR... - WHAT ARE YOU CHECKING ABOUT? - I HAVE TO CHECK IF SOMEBODY... - YOU'LL CHECK ME ON MY RESERVE? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO OTHER CHOICE? - GO. THE AMBULANCE MUST PASS. JE LES AI REVIRES L'AUTRE JOUR. ILS ETAIENT QUASIMENT RENDUS DANS LES CHARS... WE HAVE TO WALK BACK TO THE LONGHOUSE. THEY TRIED TO DESTROY IT, DESTROY OUR SPIRIT FROM INVADING IT. AND WE'RE GOING TO WALK BACK AND TAKE BACK OUR LONGHOUSE. [ Singing ] IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE MERCIER BRIDGE HAS REOPENED, AND THE VILLAGE IS STILL CORDONED OFF BY THE ARMY. THE BAND COUNCIL CALLS THE ARMY PRESENCE ILLEGAL AND CHALLENGES IT IN COURT. TOWN RESIDENTS CALL THIS EVICTION DAY, AND SERVE THE ARMY NOTICE. ... THE SURETE DU QUEBEC, THE CANADIAN ARMED FORCES, THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE, ETC. THIS EVICTION IS IMMEDIATE AND IRREVOCABLE, AND THE CONTRAVENTION OF SUCH WILL BE DEALT WITH ACCORDING TO THE GREAT LAW OF PEACE. [ Cheers, applause ] I HAPPEN TO BE A VETERAN FROM THE 2nd WORLD WAR, AND I WENT THROUGH QUITE A BIT OF IT. AND WE NEVER STONED CHILDREN, MEN, WOMEN AND OLD MEN. THIS MUST BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF A PEOPLE. AND WHEN WE GOT TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WERE HUNGRY, WE GAVE THEM FOOD, MEDICINE, AND WE TOOK CARE OF THEM. WE NEVER BEAT THEM. WE NEVER STONED ANYBODY. YOU PEOPLE BELIEVE IN THE GOOD BOOKS... JOE DEER. HE TELLS THE MEDIA HE STILL BRINGS CHOCOLATE TO HIS FRIEND WALTER LEJA, CONFINED TO A VETERAN'S HOSPITAL FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS. LEJA WAS CRIPPLED TRYING TO DISARM A BOMB PLACED IN A MAILBOX BY FLQ TERRORISTS. ... ONE GENTLEMAN, HE'S ALSO A VETERAN OF THE 2nd WORLD WAR, DIED FROM THAT FRIGHTENING THING HE HAD. HE HAD A BAD HEART... GOING THROUGH HERE WITH A ROCK GOING THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, THE MAN DIED A FEW DAYS LATER. NOW, WHAT KIND OF A PEOPLE ARE YOU ANYWAY? THEN YET YOU CALL US TERRORISTS. DO WE HAVE TO KILL SOME SOLDIERS TO GET SOME HONOURS? LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO... INTO A PISSING CONTEST WITH THE SITUATION HERE. OKAY? THE SITUATION... KEEP THINGS CALM. THAT'S ALL WE'RE AFTER. RIGHT? - ... BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE PETITION TO... - I RECEIVED IT. I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT YET, MA'AM. - WILL YOU PASS IT ON? - I'LL READ IT FIRST AND I'LL SEE WHAT IT SAYS. [ Singing ] WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT. YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING WE SAY. WHEN YOU TALK THAT LANGUAGE THAT'S ALL BULLSHIT. YOU'RE ON INDIAN LAND, TALK INDIAN. YES... THIS IS NOT FRANCE, THIS IS KAHNAWAKE. I'M A VETERAN MYSELF. I FOUGHT FOR THIS GODDAM COUNTRY, AND I'M ASHAMED OF YOU FUCKING GUYS... GO HOME! GO HOME! GET OUT OF HERE! FRENCH PIGS! SHAME, SHAME, SHAME ON YOU! LOOK AROUND. YOU'LL SEE LOTS OF NON-NATIVES. IL RESTE ENVIRON UNE VINGTAINE DE PERSONNES AUTOUR DE MON VEHICULE. LES AUTRES SONT RETOURNES VERS LEUR VILLAGE. HE IS TOLD, "BE POLITE AND DON'T DO ANYTHING TO GET THEM UPSET." IT USED TO BE THOUGHT OF AS A NON-VIOLENT SPORT UNTIL THE MAYOR OF OKA WANTED ANOTHER 9 HOLES. AT KAHNAWAKE MOHAWKS THEMSELVES HAVE A 9, AN 18 AND A 36-HOLE GOLF COURSE FOR A TOTAL OF 63 MOHAWK HOLES. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THIS ONE. A STONE'S THROW FROM THE LONGHOUSE, THE KAHNAWAKE GOLF CLUB. IT'S BEEN HERE SINCE 1914, VERY EXCLUSIVE. FOR 2 MONTHS WHILE THE BARRICADES WERE UP, MEMBERSHIP WERE MILDLY INCONVENIENCED. NOW THINGS SEEM TO BE RETURNING TO NORMAL. - YOU DIDN'T GET TO PLAY TOO MUCH THIS SUMMER? - WE WERE INVITED TO OTHER CLUBS. WE STILL GOT A LOT OF PLAY IN. - DO YOU THINK THAT STANDOFF WILL AFFECT THE MEMBERSHIP DRIVE? - I DON'T THINK SO. WE'RE ALL FRIENDS WITH THE LOCALS. THEY ALL WORK AT THE CLUB. ALL THE STAFF WERE STILL EMPLOYED WHILE THE TROUBLE WAS ON. NO PROBLEMS. THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER. THEY'RE INCHING THEIR WAY, EVERY DAY THEY GET CLOSER. THEY DON'T WANT US TO DO NOTHING. CREATE AN INCIDENT... WHAT THE HELL'S THIS BULLSHIT? WE WAKE UP, THEY STAND NEXT TO OUR BED WITH THEIR FUCKING GUN POINTING AT OUR HEADS... COMMANDANT. ASSHOLE... OR QUEER... - I ASK YOU TO OPEN THE TRUNK OR YOU LEAVE YOUR CAR THERE. - YOU'RE NOT A POLICEMAN. - YES, HE IS. - POLICEMAN HERE IS THE PEACEKEEPER. - YOU DON'T WANT TO OPEN IT? - OKAY, BACK UP AND LET HER STAY THERE, THAT'S IT. - WHEN I CROSS THE UNITED STATES BORDER I DON'T GET THIS HASSLE. I'VE NEVER BEEN HASSLED. THEY ASK ME WHO I AM, I SAYS A NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN. - ... SIR, I GOT A JOB TO DO. - YOU HAVE A JOB. I HAVE A COUNTRY. I HAVE A RESERVATION. THIS IS A RESERVATION. BIEN, SORS DE LA, FRANCIS, SORS DE LA. VIENS-T'EN. WHAT'S YOUR RANK? WHAT'S YOUR RANK?!! I GOT A WEAPON. YOU WANT TO TAKE IT? YOU'RE ONE OF HIS MESSENGERS? - I'M NOT... [ Speaking native language ] I PASS HERE EVERY DAY, TWICE A DAY. TWICE A DAY I OPEN, TWICE A DAY MY LICENSE, TWICE A DAY MY REGISTRATION. THAT SEEMS RIDICULOUS TO ME. THIS IS STRAIGHT HARASSMENT. THERE'S NO REASON FOR THIS. YOU SEE MY FACE HERE EVERY DAY. AND EVERY DAY THE SAME THING. TWICE A DAY. I HAVE NO GUNS, NO WEAPONS, NOTHING IN MY CAR. I'M A BUSINESSMAN. THERE'S MY CARD THAT I WORK OVER THERE. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FOR 20 GODDAM YEARS NOBODY BOTHERED ME. I DON'T CARRY NOTHING IN MY CAR. SEPTEMBER 18th, INTERNATIONAL PEACE DAY. TAKAKWITA ISLAND, THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE VILLAGE. THE ARMY IS LANDING IN FORCE. IT LOOKS AS IF THEY ARE ABOUT TO CROSS THE BRIDGE AND INVADE THE COMMUNITY. AT THE OTHER END OF THE ISLAND, BEHIND THE TROOPS, THE SQ HAVE COME IN BY BOAT TO CONDUCT A SEARCH. BUT NO ONE EXPLAINS WHY ALL THESE TROOPS ARE NEEDED. THERE ARE NO ANSWERS. THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER. MOHAWKS ARE RESISTING. THEY FEAR A TOTAL OCCUPATION, AND THEY ARE FED UP WITH THE ARMY PRESENCE. JESUS CHRIST! THE TEARGAS HAS REACHED KATERI HOSPITAL, THE NEAREST BUILDING TO THE ISLAND. IT HOUSES THE ELDERLY. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAD INJURIES TO TAKE CARE OF. JUNE DELISLE, THE HOSPITAL DIRECTOR. HER PATIENTS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE GASSING. I'M SURE THEY NEED YOU MORE IN KUWAIT THAN WE DO... REMEMBER, I'M MOHAWK AND I'M THE BEAR CLAN. AND THE BEAR CLAN IS MEDICINE CLAN AND IT IS STRONG. REMEMBER MY PEOPLE. I GREW UP HERE, I WORE MOUNTIE CLOTHING AND YOUR BLANKET. I'M 63 YEARS OLD. I WORE MADE-OVER MOUNTIES' COATS WHEN I HAD TO GO TO SCHOOL. OKAY? I USED YOUR ARMY BLANKETS. WE GOT THE BAG OF BEANS ONCE A YEAR TO SORT OUT... I'M NOT KIDDING YOU. I NEVER TELL LIES. THAT'S GOD'S TRUTH. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT IN YOUR DREAMS. STAY HERE. JUST STAY HERE. I GOT FUCKING BEAT UP AT THE LONGHOUSE TOO WITH THE OTHER WOMEN. AND NOBODY DID A GODDAM THING. WHERE WERE YOU? WE WON'T SOLVE IT BY ATTACKING THEM EITHER. STAY RIGHT HERE. THEY WON'T STAY IN THE BUSHES? WANT TO GO AND KICK THEIR ASS? YEAH!! LET'S GO! IT'S ASS-KICKING TIME! ONE OFFICER WOULD LATER TELL REPORTERS "THE STRONG RESISTANCE SURPRISED US. "IT WAS AMAZING THE WAY THEY REACTED "SINCE WE WEREN'T AT THE LONGHOUSE OR A SACRED PLACE." WHAT THE ARMY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT MOHAWKS BELIEVE THAT THE LAND ITSELF IS SACRED. 7 HOURS HAVE PASSED. THE ARMY ISN'T HERE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE. THEY CAN'T GET OUT. THEY WANT TO CROSS THE BRIDGE AND EXIT THROUGH THE VILLAGE BUT THE COMMUNITY HOLDS THE BRIDGE. THE ARMY WILL HAVE TO GO BACK THE WAY THEY CAME. THE TROOPS WAIT, THE JOURNALISTS FILE THEIR STORIES. THAT'S RIGHT, LATER ON AS THE CROWD PUSHED THE MILITARY FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK ON THE ISLAND, IT GOT QUITE TENSE. ONE NATIVE PERSON, ONE MOHAWK MAN ATTACKED A SOLDIER... I WAS AN EYEWITNESS. THINGS GOT QUITE UGLY AND WARNING SHOTS WERE FIRED-- AT LEAST 12 SHOTS-- INTO THE AIR TO CALM THINGS, WHICH HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. THE MILITARY THEN PULLED BACK. RIGHT AT THE MOMENT NOW, THE MILITARY IS REMOVING ITSELF, STEP BY STEP, TOWARDS WHERE THE HELICOPTERS ARE AWAITING THEM. THIS WAS THE BIGGEST MILITARY OPERATION SINCE THE PUSH ON THE OKA BARRICADES, AND THE OPENING UP OF THE MERCIER BRIDGE. AND IT PROVES THAT THE SITUATION HERE REMAINS HIGHLY VOLATILE. KEN ERNHOFER, CTV NEWS, KAHNAWAKE. THIS IS A TIME PERIOD WHERE PEACEFUL THINGS SHOULD BE DONE. I SAW YOU GO AFTER ONE OF THE GUYS... WELL, I SAW ONE THE GUYS... NO, BUT JUST YOUR FEELING OF WHAT SPARKED THAT. ANGER. THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS HERE IF THEY'RE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE SQ, UNDER BOURASSA'S ORDERS. AND THEY'RE TO GET OUT-- NOW. THEY HAVE THEIR EVICTION NOTICE. THEY'RE PAST DUE TO LEAVE. - THANKS... JOE... AND IT PROVED THAT THE SITUATION AT KAHNAWAKE AND KANESETAKE REMAIN HIGHLY VOLATILE. KEN ERNHOFER, CTV NEWS, KAHNAWAKE. OKAY, KEN, I LIKE YOUR FIRST ONE BEST. THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT CIGARETTES, OR ABOUT BINGO. IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE. THE POLITICS HERE IS WE ARE A SOVEREIGN PEOPLE, MOHAWK NATION PEOPLE. THIS IS OUR JURISDICTION. WE WILL PATROL IT. WE WILL MAKE OUR OWN LAWS OVER HERE. AND THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT THAT. THEY SAY NO, YOU HAVE TO OBEY PROVINCIAL LAW, FEDERAL LAW, ETC. THAT'S WHAT'S BEHIND THIS. NOUS PARLONS DE NOTRE COEUR. EUX AUTRES PARLENT D'AUTRES MOYENS. NOUS AUTRES, NOUS NE LES COMPRENONS PAS... IF ANYBODY'S TERROR... CRIMINALS HERE, IT'S THE SQ. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO'VE INTIMIDATED NATIVE PEOPLE AS WELL AS THEY'VE INTIMIDATED WHITE PEOPLE. YOU TALK TO A LOT OF FRANCOPHONES, ANGLOPHONES AND PEOPLE CONSIDERED ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THIS PROVINCE, AND YOU'LL FIND OUT. [ Singing ] [ Helicopters ] AFTER AN 8-HOUR SEARCH AT THE OTHER END OF THE ISLAND THE SQ HAVE LEFT BY BOAT UNNOTICED. THIS IS ANOTHER TURNING POINT IN THE CRISIS. THE ARMY WILL ANNOUNCE IT HAS DONE ITS JOB AND IT INTENDS TO GO HOME. ARMY, GO HOME! ARMY, GO HOME! ARMY, GO HOME! THE ARMY WITHDRAWAL IS STALLED. IT WAS CALLED AS AN AID TO CIVIL POWER AT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT'S PLEASURE. UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE ARMY HEARS OTHERWISE, IT IS HERE TO STAY. - THEY STOPPED YOU? - YES, AND THEY WANTED TO SEE MY DRIVER'S LICENSE, MY REGISTRATION, MY NAME AND THEN IN MY TRUNK... CHIEF NORTON IS HEADED FOR OTTAWA WHERE PARLIAMENT REOPENS TOMORROW. SO I'M DEMANDING UNDER WHAT ORDERS, WHAT SECTION, WHAT LAW THEY'RE DOING THIS. THEY'RE NOW CHECKING UP THE LADDER TO SEE IF THEY CAN TELL ME. YOU ASK ANY POLICE OFFICER AND HE CAN TELL YOU ON THE SPOT. THESE GUYS HAVE TO GO THROUGH 25 DIFFERENT LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY AND WHATEVER ELSE BEFORE THEY CAN GIVE YOU AN ANSWER. WHILE THE GOVERNMENT WAS ON HOLIDAY, THE COUNTRY WAS CLOSE TO CIVIL WAR. THERE WERE SCORES OF BLOCKADES AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF SUPPORT RIGHT ACROSS CANADA. NOW, WITH PARLIAMENT ABOUT TO RECONVENE, THE FEELING IS THE CRISIS WILL BE ENDED TO AVOID A DEBATE IN THE HOUSE. NORTON NEVER MAKES IT TO OTTAWA. AFTER HAVING TALKED TODAY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE MOHAWK LEADERSHIP, THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE MUCH CLOSER THAN ONE MAY THINK. JESSE JACKSON, FORMER US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AMBASSADOR OF PEACE, IS HERE AT KAHNAWAKE TO DO A SEGMENT FOR HIS NEW TV SHOW. THE EVENTS OF THE LAST 2 MONTHS WILL BE THE BACKDROP. - SPEND BASICALLY MOST OF YOUR TIME-- FACES, CUTAWAYS. - FOLLOWING JOE, NO? - IF JOE'S SPEAKING, YES. BUT OTHERWISE... HE'S BEEN TO SOUTH AFRICA, LEBANON, IRAN. HE LIKES BEING IN THE PUBLIC EYE. LET ME EXPRESS MY THANKS TO YOU, CHIEF, FOR BEING SO GENEROUS IN YOUR TIME TODAY AND FOR SHARING VERY VITAL INFORMATION WITH OUR DELEGATION. THERE IS A WORLD WAR BREWING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AND YET IF TALKING IS IMPOSSIBLE, WAR IS INEVITABLE. WE MUST SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE OTHER TERRITORY THAT IS ALSO LOCATED IN THIS AREA IS AKWASASNE, THE OTHER MOHAWK TERRITORY UNDER SIEGE. I'M GONNA NEED TO LEAVE. THANK YOU, BROTHER. I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT. JACKSON GETS HIS TV SHOTS JUST IN TIME. 2 DAYS LATER, THE SIEGE AT OKA ENDS. MOHAWK CHECKPOINT KAHNAWAKE. 78 DAYS, LONGER THAN THE SIEGE AT WOUNDED KNEE. INSTEAD OF LEADING THEM TO A BUS, THEY ROUGHED THEM UP. 5 MOHAWKS WERE TAKEN INTO SQ CUSTODY. NATIVES GATHERED IN THE TOWN WERE FURIOUS. THE PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED BY WHAT IS ON TELEVISION. NOBODY HAS BEEN KILLED, BUT IT HAS ENDED IN ANGER AND CONFUSION. THE NATIVES SAY IT WAS A DOUBLE-CROSS. CLERGY AND LAYWERS TO JOIN THEM WEREN'T ALLOWED IN, AND THE BUSES TO FARNHAM WEREN'T THERE. IN KAHNAWAKE, THE MOST DANGEROUS CONFRONTATION CAME AFTER THE SIEGE HAD ENDED. EARLIER ON TONIGHT, ONE OF MY SECTIONS OF 6 MEN WAS MANNING ITS NORMAL POST WHEN A CROWD OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MOHAWKS ARRIVED AND STARTED TO JEER AND ATTACK THEM WITH ROCKS AND COME FORWARD TO ATTACK THEM WITH AXE HANDLES. - THERE WAS A MOHAWK PERSON INJURED TONIGHT? - A MOHAWK INJURED ONE OF MY SOLDIERS-- GOT A LEAP PIPE ACROSS THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD. - WHO ORDERED THIS OPERATION, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL? IT WAS COMMENCED BY THE MOHAWKS FOR NO APPARENT REASON. IT WAS IN REACTION TO AN EARLIER OPERATION, TO WHAT THEY SAW ON THE TV AT OKA, OR TO A SWEEP BY THE 3rd BATTALION, THE ROYAL 22nd REGIMENT, ON ILE ST. NICOLAS, NOT A PART OF THE RESERVE, BUT WHICH THE MOHAWKS CLAIM IS A PART OF KAHNAWAKE. THEY SAY THAT'S IN REACTION TO THAT. I CAN'T CONFIRM THAT OR IF THERE WERE INJURIES ON THE MOHAWK SIDE. - HOW FAR ARE YOU AUTHORIZED TO GO IN A SO-CALLED RIOT? - OUR ORDERS ARE TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE LIFE OF PEOPLE, WHETHER IT BE OUR SOLDIERS OR CITIZENS. THAT IF WE HAVE TO USE DEADLY FORCE TO PROTECT LIFE, WE WILL DO SO. - ... DID YOU FIRE INTO THE CROWD? - WE DID NOT. WE FIRED WARNING SHOTS. - SOMEONE WAS SHOT. - I DON'T KNOW IF HE GOT HIT OR NOT. SOME GUYS GOT HIT WITH TEARGAS GRENADES. THEY GOT HIT IN THE LEGS. - WAS THAT FIRING ACCIDENTAL? - THEY AIMED RIGHT AT THE GUYS AND SHOT THE TEARGAS. - WHAT TIME? - ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, I GUESS. PRIOR TO THAT, THERE WAS AN ALTERCATION, AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE SHOT WITH RUBBER BULLETS. I SAW TWO OF THEM HERE THAT EVENING, AND ONE HAD A... BASICALLY A LACERATION OF THE OUTER ASPECT THE UPPER PART OF THE LEFT LOWER LEG. AND THE OTHER HAD MULTIPLE FRAGMENTS IN HIS FOREARM. WE EXTRACTED THE FRAGMENTS AND HE DID WELL. THE LAST OF 3,700 TROOPS WILL BE RETURNING TO THEIR BASES; 1,500 JOURNALISTS HAVE PACKED UP AND GONE. I WANT TO CONTACT SOMEBODY WHO'S IN CHARGE FOR THE SQ IN THE REGION. WOULD YOU HAVE A PHONE NUMBER? [ Singing, drums ] [ Cheers, applause ] THESE ARE THE WOMEN WHO HELD OFF THE ARMY AT OKA. THEY HAVE RETURNED TO KAHNAWAKE. A WEEK LATER, THE MEN RETURN. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM DETENTION. IT'S 10:45. THE WHOLE TOWN TURNS OUT TO WELCOME THEM. THEIR FIRST PORT OF CALL: THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS BUILDING NAMED AFTER THE ALLEGED DISCOVERER OF AMERICA. IT'S NOT A HAPPY DAY FOR EVERYONE. EARLIER, QUEBEC NATIVE AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN CIACCIA AND SAM ELKAS, THE MINISTER IN CHARGE OF THE SQ, WERE DEMOTED. THESE ARE THE SO-CALLED WARRIORS. MILLIONS SAW THEM ON TV. CAMOUFLAGE OUTFITS AND MASKS. THE MEDIA HAD MADE THEM STARS. IT'S MIDNIGHT, THE MASQUERADE IS OVER. RICHARD TWO AXE, KAHNAWAKE. RICHARD TWO AXE, EX-IRON WORKER. MIKE MAYO, KAHNAWAKE.

AND PEOPLE SHOULD BE THERE FOR THEM ON WEDNESDAY FOR THEIR BAIL HEARING, AND WHEN THEY COME OUT, WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER BIG PARTY. IN THE COMING MONTHS, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE AT OKA WILL BE TAKEN UP WITH TRIALS AND FUND-RAISING FOR THEIR DEFENCE. NOW, THE ACCOUNTANTS TALLY UP THE BILL FOR THE CRISIS. OVER $200 MILLION. THE FINAL COSTS MAY NEVER BE KNOWN. THE MOHAWK WARRIOR FLAG ALSO FLIES AT THE HAGUE, WHERE THEY HAVE A PERMANENT DELEGATION. THEY HAVE MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE UN IN GENEVA AND AWAIT A REPORT FROM THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. - HOW MANY CHECKPOINTS ARE THERE? - I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S A FEW OF THEM. - AND THERE'S GUYS HERE 24 HOURS A DAY? - YEAH. AND THEY'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB. 'CAUSE A LOT OF US ARE NOT SLEEPING GOOD AT NIGHT RIGHT NOW... THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN OVER A LONG TIME AGO. EVERYTHING THAT WAS TOLD WERE GOING TO BE DONE HAVEN'T BEEN DONE. 'CAUSE YOU COULD SEE FOR YOURSELF. ALONG THESE HIGHWAYS, THE SQ ARE ALL OVER.

THE OKA GOLF COURSE, WHERE THE SUMMER OF VIOLENCE BEGAN: OTTAWA HAS NOW PURCHASED SOME LAND FROM THE TOWN OF OKA AND CLAIMS THE DISPUTE IS OVER, THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED. MOHAWKS CLAIM OTTAWA BOUGHT THE WRONG LAND. THE VERY PIECE OF LAND THAT WAS AT THE REAL HEART OF THE STRUGGLE, WHAT WE WERE HERE ALL SUMMER FOR... WHERE THE BATTLE... IS NOT OURS ACCORDING TO THEIR LAW AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS. AND THEY HAVE RECENTLY... I DON'T KNOW... THEY HAVE PLANS FOR THIS TOWN NOW, TO MAKE IT A TOURIST HAVEN... THEY USED TO PLAY SUPER BINGO HERE. IT IS NOW A FLEA MARKET. WE THOUGHT WE'D START ANOTHER BUSINESS, SOMETHING THAT'S MAYBE A LITTLE LESS POLITICAL, WHICH IS THE MOHAWK SUPER FLEA MARKET. THE MOHAWK SUPER BINGO HAS BEEN ABOLISHED TEMPORARILY. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE RESTARTED. IT WILL BE. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE WANT TO GET A SUPER FLEA MARKET, REALLY A LUCRATIVE FLEA MARKET, GOING. IN SOME INSTANCES WHEN PEOPLE COME HERE, VENDORS ESPECIALLY, TO SET UP IN THE MORNINGS, THEY'RE BEING HARASSED. WE HAVE APPROACHED, ACTUALLY, THE POLICE THEMSELVES, THEY HAVE SAID YES, THEIR ORDERS ARE REALLY TO HARASS PEOPLE. SO NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, THEY'LL HARASS AND BOTHER US. THEY DON'T WANT US TO DEVELOP OUR OWN ECONOMY, TO CREATE JOBS, TO CIRCULATE MONEY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. THEY WANT US TO SPEND OUR MONEY BACK IN CHATEAUGUAY. AND NO ONE IS SPENDING MONEY THERE. BUSINESSES IN CHATEAUGUAY ARE DYING AND CRYING, AND THEY'LL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT. WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THEY DID THIS SUMMER. WE ARE THE VICTIMS THERE TOO. ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERS OF MY GROUP, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND YOUR WARM WELCOME HERE TODAY. BEHIND YOU ON THE WALL YOU SEE ONE OF THE SYMBOLS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WHOSE PEOPLE WE TRY TO REPRESENT. 12 STARS REPRESENTING THE 12 STATES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, REPRESENTING OUR PEOPLES, IN THEIR INDEPENDENCE, IN THEIR AUTONOMY, IN THEIR UNIQUE WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. SEPARATE BUT UNITED, AND THAT IS THE SYMBOL OF THE CIRCLE, A SYMBOL OF FULLNESS, A SYMBOL OF HARMONY. AND IT IS ONLY BY RESPECTING THAT UNIQUENESS OF EACH HUMAN BEING AND OF EACH NATION THAT PEACE CAN REIGN IN THE WORLD, THAT HARMONY CAN BE ATTAINED. closed captions SOUS-TITRAGE PLUS INC.
