[wind whooshes] [wings flap] [tense music] [metal clanks] [explosion] [tires squeal] [intense music] [tires squeal] - Oh, boy. - Woo! [Chad chuckles] - Come on, Monty, step on it! - Ralphie! [tires squeal] - Why won't you guys just leave me alone? [tires squeal] - Go, Monty! Woo! [tires squeal] Yeah! - Woo! - Don't. - Come on, Ralphie boy. [chuckles] - Yeah! Whoa! [Lance laughs] [birds chirp] [tires squeal] - Hey, come here, little Ralph, come here, Ralphie. Come here! - You're dead, Ralph! [breathes heavily] - Why don't you guys pick on someone in your own income bracket? - Chad. [Ralph groans] - I bet you're real sorry you opened your mouth, huh? - Shove it, Chad. - Hey, I haven't cracked anybody's skull in a week. - You seem to be having a hard time understanding the order of things around here, Ralph. See, I'm like God, and you're like, I don't know, dirt. So when I want something from you, lunch money, car, kidney, whatever, you give. 'Cause if you don't give, I got a whole set of golf clubs in my locker I can use on you. You ever get whacked with a nine iron, Ralph? It hurts. Just ask my stepdad. - You hit your stepdad with a golf club? - Hey, what can I say? I really wanted that sports car. See you around, loser. [Ralph groans] - Man, I hate those preppy buttheads. [soft music] - And because of this agreement, North America was plunged into several hundred years of bloody civil unrest that has stayed a part of our culture to this very day. Now, can anyone else contribute something on the Oglethorpe-Bratwurst Accord of 1791? How about you, Ralph? You seem to be busy as a beaver over there. Ralph? Ralph? - Ralph. - Um-- - Ralph, you know while I appreciate the pretty pictures, I have to remind you, this is not art class. - Sorry, Mrs. O'Houlihan. - I suppose you're safe for the day, but take it to heart when I say that those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it. Next year, that is. Bear that in mind and I will see you all tomorrow, [bell rings] toodles. - Oh, man, can you believe this crap? We've got our Introduction to Manual Labor class next. We have to go down to the basement and help the construction guys dig up the new teachers' lounge. If you ask me, it's a total scam. - So why did you take the class? - What? You don't believe a woman's capable of manual labor? - [chuckles] Why is it that every time I get under your skin a little, you bring up the whole women's rights issue? - I don't know, easy out maybe. - Mm-hmm. - And, uh, speaking of women, Ralph, when are you gonna find you somebody? - Oh, don't start again, okay, Baxter? - Hey, I'm just trying to give you some credit. I mean, you're not a monk, right? - Well, maybe there is one person. - No kidding? Who? - Oh, somebody. - Felicia St. Clair? Dude, forget it, she's head cheerleader. And she's popular, and she's dating about 250 pounds of bad meat. - Flash Gunderson. [chuckles] He's not so great. I mean, you take away his money, his nice car, his muscles, and his good looks, and what do you got? - You? [Baxter fake chuckles] [Baxter chuckles] [tense music] - Oh, no. - Oh. [sighs] - You staring at my girlfriend again, Ralph? - Just stop it, Flash, I am tired of you picking on people all the time. - This is my battle, sweet pea. You just stand back and dodge this geek's guts when they start flying. - You don't own me. - I wasn't looking, Flash. - I saw you, butthead! Next time, I'm gonna rip off your head and spit down your neck! Got it, geek? Keep your eyes on your comic books! - I'm real sorry, Ralph. - Stop talking to that freak. Honey? What? What did I say? - That wasn't so good, Ralph. - [chuckles] You don't say? [bell rings] Oh, crap, we got about five seconds to get to the basement before Lipkis has one serious freakout. - I want you to pay close, particular attention to that pickax operator working on that wall over there. There will be a quiz tomorrow on the use of the pickax. I expect every one of you to demonstrate to me the proper use and handling of a Hirsch model-P titanium-tipped rock-breaking device. [clears throat] Those of you who have notes from your mommies will be excused from the exercise. The rest of you, listen up, this class is Introduction to Manual Labor, not Introduction to Needlepoint. Now I wanna start seeing some serious sweat and blood around here! Hold it right there! Well, what do we have here? A couple of AWOLs? Not on my watch, no, sir. - Um, sorry we're late, sir. Uh, but we have a really good reason. - Uh, yeah, see, Ralph here's a hemophiliac, right? And his nose started to bleed, so we had to staunch the blood flow before he went into a coma. Right? - Um, a coma, right. - I'll just bet. This is the third time you two have been late for class this week. - We're awful sorry, Mr. Lipschitz. [Ralph chuckles] - That's Lipkis, young lady, Mr. Lipkis. - Right, Lipkis, uh, we're real sorry. - You're sorry? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wound up with two sad sacks of silly putty who can't find it in their hearts to show up to my class on time! - Look, whatever we have to do to make it up, we'll do it. - Well, I'm glad to hear you say that, son, 'cause the two of you are gonna stay after school and clean every brick in the old boundary wall, with these! [gong] - Oh, you and your big mouth. - But, Mr. Lipkis-- - No buts! Now I wanna see you down here after school busting your tailbone on that brick wall! And if I find you being late for that, I'm gonna put you on sewer-pipe detail, comprende? - Yes, sir. - Sure. - Carry on. [Baxter sighs] - It's not even a Reach toothbrush. Well, if you're tired of getting pushed around by those guys, you gotta push back. - And get the crap beaten out of me by Flash? No, thanks. - Well, you're already getting the crap beat out of you anyway, right? - Well, there's degrees of crap that can be beaten out of you. I mean, you hit back, you up the ante. - So what do you wanna do? You wanna be afraid of those guys the rest of your life? [tense music] - There's something on the other side of this wall. - Ew, I bet it's that old sewer pipe. Best we don't go there, you know? [taps on brick] - It's hollow. Maybe it's an old bomb shelter? - Or maybe it's a secret passage to the boys' locker room, huh? [chuckles] Hey, I can dream, can't I? It's definitely a door to something. - Yeah. But it doesn't have any knobs, or keyholes, or anything. - Well, I bet that's the way you open it right there. It's kinda shaped like a hand. - Yeah, but it only has three fingers. - Maybe it's the Bugs Bunny lock. - Or maybe it's the universal sign for keep the heck out. - Man, I bet it's just one of those old bomb shelters they used to make. I heard my grandpa talking about 'em, you know, back in the old days, when they used to make those record player thingies. - This doesn't look like it was made in the old days. I do not think this is a good idea. - Take a Xanax, okay, Ralph? [door whooshes] [door opens] - What do you think? [dramatic music] [tense music] Maybe we should see what's inside? - You first. - Okay. - What? Are we gonna, like, brush 'em to death? - Hey, you know, you can put someone's eye out with one of these if you try hard enough. [Ralph gasps] - The lights came on when you stepped in there. - Yeah, not a good sign. - Whoa. This is totally trippy. - Yeah. What in the hell is it? - Wow. - These look like guns. Big guns. It's like a storeroom or something. - Yeah, but for what? I mean, these things don't even look real. - Maybe they were props for a movie or something. Or toys. - Maybe it's a secret government stockpile, you know, like where they keep all that crazy stuff from Area 54? - Studio 54, and we are nowhere near Area 51. - See? That's what makes it such a good hiding place. Oh, wow. - These feel like plastic. - That's definitely the weirdest football uniform I ever saw. - It's not a football uniform. - Lacrosse? - Whatever it is, it's mechanical. See, the power supply's in the back, kinda like a spacesuit. [Baxter gasps] - Spacesuit? [taps glass] - What the heck is this thing? - I don't know, but whatever it is, it doesn't look good. - Hmm. [computer beeps] - [scoffs] Nice clock. [computer beeps] Whoa, you see that? - 75, 76, 77, 78 slashes. - Why are you counting them? - I don't know, it might be important. - Hey, what are you doing now? - I'm serious, I'm taking notes. That's the first rule you learn in journalism class, you gotta take notes of every little detail, so I'm gonna write this stuff down. - Wonder who all this stuff belongs to? - Well, chances are it won't be cool if somebody finds out we've been in here, you know? - We don't tell anybody about this, okay? - Okay, you think this will fool Mr. Lipkis? - Just as long as he doesn't come back to reality for any length of time, sure. - All right, let's go. [Flash chuckles] - Nice trip. See you next fall. - Ralph, you're going the wrong way! - Why don't you leave me alone, Flash? - Oh, you're ready to rumble now, geek? - I'm really getting tired of this, Flash! What are you, eight? - Hey, I'm just playing with the little bookworm. Get off my case. - If you don't knock it off, you're gonna get off my case for a while, do you know what I mean? - Come on, Ralph, time to go. - What do you mean? - What is wrong with you? - I told you to watch out for the old hallway leg sweep, it's Flash's favorite move. - Why did you pull me away, huh? I thought you were the one telling me to stand up for myself? - Well, start smaller, okay? Look, Ralph, you're my best friend, but I'm gonna be straight with you, Flash Gunderson could snap your spine like a Slim Jim at a Weight Watchers convention. [tense music] What's wrong? Whoa, what's up with the new kids? And I thought I had problems. - You do. We got our next class with them, so don't stare. [tense music] [clock ticks] - God, it's like looking at another fucking race or something. Creepy. - Maybe they're triplets. - Hola, everyone. Today, we will be continuing the lovely and infinitely-fascinating saga of the Bloombottom-Spattlesgore Tariff of 1897. So if we can all just open our text to... Well, my goodness, it seems as if we have picked up a few new passengers on our journey to knowledge. Well, allow me to introduce myself, I am your teacher, Mrs. O'Houlihan, and I will be your tour guide through American history class, third period, a most rewarding human experience. And you are? - Phil. - Bill. - Jill. - Well, isn't that nice? You all rhyme. [chuckles] - We are foreign exchange students. - Do you have last names to share with us? - No. - I see. - Well, I suppose all oogly stuff is for Student Admissions to worry about. In the meantime, sit back and enjoy the wonderful little day trip we are about to take through American history. [tense music] - Maybe they're from New Jersey or something. [upbeat music] Man, can you believe those new kids? Total creepazoids. - They're, like, the least of our problems right now, okay? Hey, did you bring those big duffle bags? - Yeah, but what are we gonna do with all the stuff? - We'll put what we can in our lockers for now until we can figure out a safer place. - Great plan, so what if it's radioactive or something? - Then, uh, we'd be dead right now. Where did you think we were gonna put it? - I don't know, your room? - Thanks. [door opens] [tense music] Can you believe those guys? [chuckles] - We would like to sit here. - Alone. - Thank you. - Hey, listen here, blondie, I don't know where you're from, but around here, it's first come, first serve, all right? [electricity buzzes] [glass shatters] Enjoy. - Secure the perimeter before you close up tonight. They're everywhere. - That guy's crazy. [construction worker chuckles] [tense music] - Gee, that was close. - Looks like the wall's held up pretty good. - Yeah. [drops brick] [tense music] [door opens] [tracker beeps] - What is it? - Someone has opened the arsenal for a second time. We're close. It's somewhere inside this building. - Okay, two pistol thingies, and two sets of aluminum long johns. [computer beeps] - I don't get it, everything else in this room is out in the open, except this thing. - Hey, what happened with that clock thingy? There's only 54 slashes. Oh, just what I thought, yesterday there were 78. - So? - So, we were here at five o'clock yesterday, 78 slashes, so now, 5:15 today, roughly the same time we were here yesterday, 54 slashes. This is why you don't read comics in class, braino, you gotta do the math. 24 slashes gone, 24 hours, it is some kinda clock, it runs by hours, not minutes. - Pretty weird clock, don't you think? - It makes about as much sense as anything else in this room. Oh, maybe we should pick that up too. - Hey, I do not think that's such a hot idea. We should just leave this here. - Well, what if somebody else finds it? - [Ralph] If we can't open, the chances are whoever else finds it won't be able to either. - Oh, wow, man, I'm definitely taking this. This'll look pretty cool in my room. - Oh, no. You are not using any of this stuff as a lava lamp, okay? Let's just get what we can into our lockers and be done with it. - Uh-oh. - Hey, baby doll. Looks like you're having some problems with your locker. - Uh, yeah, Chad, I was just cleaning some stuff out. You know, it was starting to scare me to open it. [chuckles] - What do we have here? - Oh, that's just some stuff I had sitting around in my locker. - Let's take a look and see. [Baxter sighs] [Chad chuckles] You have a bag full of toys in your locker? - Yeah, it's just a bag full of toys, that's me, I'm a big, fat baby, goo-goo. [chuckles] - Stupid toy guns? Pow! [Chad chuckles] Zap! [Baxter sighs] - Chad... - What? You're afraid I'm gonna pull the trigger and you're gonna get squirted? - Mm-hmm. [Chad chuckles] [Chad fires gun] [Chad moans] [Baxter breathes heavily] I guess you were holding it the wrong way, polo boy. Ralph? Ralph? - [Ralph] Are you gonna tell me why we're out here? - Yeah, because this part of town's pretty much empty, and I don't think we wanna attract attention right now, okay? - Well, all I'm saying is, I think I saw this place on last week's episode of Cops. - [chuckles] Man, you shoulda seen what happened to Chad, it was awesome. Well, not the part about him getting all shot up and stuff, but the rest of it. [chuckles] - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, now it's serious. Somebody got killed, okay? So maybe we should just go to the police or something. - I don't think he got killed. - You said he just vanished, Baxter, I don't think they can cure that with a bandaid and some hydrogen peroxide. - No, I said he got shot, but some, I don't know, thing opened up behind him and sucked him away like he was smoke. - What kind of thing? - A swirly thing. I'll show you. Oh. Oops, that woulda sucked. [Baxter fires gun] [blows on gun] - Wow. [chuckles] This is really serious. [Baxter chuckles] - It's a zap gun. - What I think it is is some kind of teleportation device, you know, like Star Trek. You shoot something with it, and whatever it is you shoot gets taken to another place. - Yeah, but where? - I don't know. Another dimension? May be a time machine. But whatever it is, it's definitely not something our guys could've made up. Or any guys. - But who? - I don't know. It doesn't weigh a lot. [gun charges] - You hear that? I think it's gonna blow up. [gun fires] [explosion] Wow. - [chuckles] I hate to say this, but this is incredibly freaking cool. - [chuckles] Yeah. - Oh, man. What do you think this does? - I don't know. [electricity buzzes] [Baxter scoffs] [electricity buzzes] - It's a super suit. You put it on, it gives you super strength. Do you know what this means? - Um, you can try out for the football team now? - This is like superhero stuff, space cannons, war beams, super strength. It really is like a comic book. - Yeah, well, that's all fine for you, Ralph, but I kind of like living here on Earth, you know, with real people and stuff. - That rock was real, and I crushed it. - You look really ridiculous in that outfit, you know? - Your turn. [electricity buzzes] - I feel really stupid in this outfit. - I think it looks neat. [tense music] The new kids. - Who are you? Return our arsenal at once. - Uh, arsenal? - This, Ralph. [gunfire] Did you see that? The new kids have guns. - I heard about this when I was, like... [gunfire] Like kids who attack other kids for their shoes or jackets and stuff. [gunfire] - Are you insane? They're after the weapons. [gunfire] [fire crackles] [gunfire] [Ralph groans] That should've killed me. [gunfire] This is a dream, it's gotta be. - There were people shooting at us, Ralph. Is that registering with you? We have to take this to the police or something. It's getting way outta hand. - Well, maybe we shouldn't be so hasty. - Oh, no, uh-uh, no, we cannot keep this stuff. I mean, this isn't like, "Wow, I found 20 bucks in a library book," okay? I mean, we found some freaky space gizmos in a secret room under the school, and now people are getting zapped, and we almost got shot up by three rejects from The Sex Pistols Reunion Tour. How about a little reality with that coffee, huh? Don't you remember what happened to Chad? - Right, something happened to Chad, but he pretty much brought that upon himself, didn't he? Now, for whatever reason, we find these things after they've been buried underground for maybe hundreds of years, and I doubt whoever, or whatever, made them is gonna be around to come looking for them. - Are you even listening to what you're saying? I mean, this is right out there with, like, Bigfoot and Amityville Horror. - Like I told you before, the weapons and stuff, they're ours now, and we could use 'em if we really wanted to. - For what? - How would you like to get even with Monty, and Flash, and all those guys who keep picking on us? [dramatic music] [doors open] [tense music] - What the crap? - Silence! - Look, I don't know what you clowns are doing here, but Halloween's a way off, so why don't you get your stupid, dumb robot costumes outta here? - No, Flash Gunderson of Earth, we will not. - All right, well, then how's about a knuckle sandwich from fist city? [punches metal] [Flash groans] [Flash groans] [knuckles crack] - As you can see, Earth boy, your puny muscles are no match against our superior might. - You almost broke my hand. Who are you? - We are alien terminators from the planet Mandark. - We are here to render final judgment against you, Flash Gunderson, for your crimes against humanity. - What crimes? - Silence! It is we who ask the questions around here, if, uh, we have any, which we don't. At any rate, you have preyed upon the weak and smaller around you, you've also abused your position on the football team to terrorize the innocent, and also to date all of the really hot chicks, so nobody else gets a shot. - Hey, I got needs too, you know? - Because of these crimes, we have decreed to sentence you to a life of repenting your evil ways. You will give up your life as a jock and spend your remaining years in high school maintaining a 4.0 average. - You will stop drinking. - You will do homework. - You will only date girls on the yearbook staff, and you will only wear button-up shirts. - You will become a caring nurturer. - Studying will become your life. - This is a load of bull. Nobody's gonna make me study, nobody. - You will. - Oh, yeah, and if I don't? [fires gun] [Chad moans] That sounded like Chad Garrison. - Yes, Chad was being what you Earth people refer to as a butthead, so we had to banish him to Dimension X. - Dimension X? - That's where the bad people go, Flash. And that's where you'll go, unless you change your attitude and do everything which we have instructed you to do. - You don't want to be a butthead, do you, Flash? - No. - Good, then we will be watching you, every minute, every day, to make sure that you are living the life of a complete bookworm and maintaining a 4.0 average. Fail us and you will be spending a long vacation with your friend Chad. - Yes. I mean, no, I won't fail you guys. - Zantar of Mandark has spoken. [tense music] - Uh, thanks. [doors open] Man, they really hurt my hand. [Baxter chuckles] - [chuckles] Can you believe that? I mean, Flash was almost in tears. - Yeah, I don't even care if he goes through with that studying jazz, because it was worth it just to see that look on his face. [Ralph chuckles] - I mean, this is really gonna change things, Baxter. I mean, all of these years in school, and for once, we're not gonna have to worry about getting picked on. - Well, maybe we shouldn't get too excited about this stuff, Ralph. It's insane, I mean, there's gotta be a bigger purpose for this stuff than just to scare the life out of a lunkhead football player, you know? And what about those three new kids? - Well, as long as we have this stuff, nobody's gonna mess with us. - I don't know, call me crazy, but getting shot at's messing with me pretty good, you know? [bell rings] [tense music] - Nice curves. - Oh, hi, Lance. Sorry, I was so busy painting, I didn't notice you. Say, where's Monty and Chad? You three are usually always together. - I thought I'd take this opportunity to spend a little alone time with you. - I always thought of myself as more of a people person. You know, big groups, lots of exit doors. - Hot little ticket like you? No, see, I'm thinking quiet dinner for two, candles, wine, nice music, just you and, uh, me. - Nice cologne. - I'm not wearing any cologne, it's Vitalis. - Okay, Lance, you know what? This slick act might work with some of your junior high girls, but I usually make a rule of not dating anyone whose nails spend more time in the salon than mine do. - You want I should do neanderthal thing like Flash? Me so sweaty, me take hot cheerleader after big game. You like that better? - No means no! A kick in the pants means no too, got it? I'm not interested! Anyway, Flash will probably show up in about five seconds to walk me to cheerleading practice, so if I were you, I'd jet. - Mm, nope, I don't see Flash anywhere. Anyway, it's not like I'm asking you to marry me. I just want a chance to see you in action after the big game. Nothing sleazy, just you, me, your cheerleader outfit. - Sounds like a blast, let me get back to you in about four years or so, okay? I think you should go now. - You know, the more you say no, the more I'm thinking you really wanna say yes. - Great. [communicator beeps] - Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9, this is Big Red, Smokey's coming up on your back door, over. They're walkie-talkies, just like on Star Trek. You know, you get one, I get one, and then we can call each other. - Gee, if it wasn't for these, I mighta done something crazy, like use the phone. [Baxter scoffs] - I wonder what these do? - I don't know. [goggles power up] [tense music] [Baxter gasps] What? - Dude, they're X-ray goggles. - No way? Let me see those. [chuckles] I don't see anything any different. [tense music] - Hola. - Oh, god. [chuckles] That was horrible. You know, I bet if you adjust the knobs and stuff, you'd be able to see through walls. - You think so? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, wow, I bet we could make a fortune playing poker with those things. - Yeah. [Baxter chuckles] [goggles power up] [tense music] - You think you're the first date I had to get the hard way? - [Baxter] Where are you going? - To kick some serious butt. [Baxter scoffs] - Lance, I don't think you know how much trouble you can get in for this. - What? With school? A rich kid like me gets a slap on the wrist, and it doesn't even go on my permanent record. - What happens when I tell my very jealous, jock boyfriend? - If there's one thing guys like Flash are afraid of, it's guys like me. Anything else you wanna try? - What about a set of sharp scissors? - Bring it on. I like a broad with a little spunk to her. [tense music] - Class dismissed, punk. - What's this crap? - Leave the girl alone, or I might have to show you. - Yeah? Say, I'm real scared. Tell you what, Tin Man, maybe I'll stomp the life outta you and your mighty dork and powder-puff ranger outfit. Then I'll get down to business with her while you watch. Sound like a plan? I'm not messing around anymore. If you don't clear outta here, I'm gonna cut her open. I mean it! - I believe you. [fires gun] Are you okay? - I'm fine. I hope I'm fine. Am I gonna be fine? - I won't hurt you. - What happened to Lance? - Let's just say Lance is gonna have a long time to think about working on his social skills. - Hm. So I guess, um, you saved my life, huh? Who are you? The Masked Adventurer? Superteen? - Just a friend. - Thanks, friend. [tense music] - So, the Earth creature that has stolen our arsenal is a student at this school. - And we have determined that the arsenal itself is somewhere in this building. I say we disintegrate the creature now and possess our property. - We no longer have the element of surprise, the creatures know our faces. Either we act now or we stay hidden. - If we strike now, it will draw too much attention to us. We must wait for the proper time. And we must find the arsenal. [tracker beeps] It appears someone has found it for us. - I wish I knew who was under that mask. [door opens] - Sweet creamery butter. [tracker beeps] There's not supposed to be a bomb shelter here. Now I don't know what kinda wacky weed you three juvenile delinquents have been smoking, but this here is, A, a construction site and, B, my classroom, you do not waltz your butts down here anytime you feel like it! - We require access to this chamber. - Please step aside. [Mr. Lipkis scoffs] - Step aside? [Mr. Lipkis chuckles] I am gonna slap you three hooligans in detention for so long, by the time you get out, you'll be able to collect social security! What do you think of them little green apples? - The time for conversing with this creature is over. - Who in the Wide World of Sports are you? [fires gun] [fires gun] [Mr. Lipkis moans] [fires gun] - The weapons are gone, the miserable Earth creatures have stolen everything. - Not everything. - [Phil] The Armageddon device. - But they have stolen its power source. And the retrograde counter shows we have little over a day to retrieve it before the stars are aligned for the force download from our home planet. - It is of no concern. We will retrieve our property shortly and commence with our plans. - But how? - Leave that to me. - Captain Cosmo. Now I really am Captain Cosmo. [tense music] And here's my chance to prove it. - Fill it up! And I don't mean with that chump change you got in that register. - We only have a couple hundred dollars in the diner, it's policy. - Don't lie to me! - Just do what he says, I think he means business. - You guys got a secret wall safe behind the counter, I seen it! Now either you start going for the real cash or I'm gonna fix it to where you never need to use Clearasil again, got me? [tense music] What the? - Pay for your corn dogs and get out. It's closing time. - You're asking for it, dipstick! [fires gun] [electricity buzzes] [thug screams] - Call the police, he'll be out for a while. - I don't know who you are, mister, but you just saved my life. That creep was gonna kill me. - You're a real hero, you know that? - A hero. Guess I won't be needing you anymore. - Where is he? [dramatic music] - Hey. - What the hell happened to you? - I sold some of my comic books, I decided it was time to get some decent clothes. And I got contacts too. - You sold your comic books? - Yeah. Pretty cool, huh? - [scoffs] Ralph, tell me you didn't really sell your comic books? I mean, you don't really think that your problems stem from the fact that you didn't have any cool clothes? - No, I mean, I just decided it was time to grow up a little. Anyway, you were right, you know? I mean, the comic books were just holding me back. - Holding you back from what? From dressing like one of those guys off of Dawson's Creek? - Hi, Ralph. - Hey, how's it going? [Baxter sighs] Girls notice me, Baxter. I mean, I've spent three years in this school, and none of these girls would've given me the time of day in a watch factory. - Yeah, but this isn't you, it's like something you'd see on TV or in a magazine. - Well, what do you want me to be, huh? A dork? If I was a dork, would that be okay with you? Hey, girls. [Ralph chuckles] Anyway, I mean, do you honestly think I was better off when Monty, and Flash, and all those other clowns were picking on me? Or how about when I was sitting in the corner reading Spider-Man instead of asking somebody out? - No, see, I'm glad, if you really wanna go out there and make your life better, but this isn't making you better, it's just making you some kind of big phony. I mean, do you want that? Do you want some girl to like you because of some overpriced clothes? - It's a start. - This is because of that stupid stuff we found, isn't it? You know, I've been thinking, and if we're gonna use that stuff just to make ourselves popular at Mount Limbaugh High School, then we're pretty pathetic. I mean, there's a whole world out there that could use this stuff, we could do really great things with the suits and the guns. - Pathetic? - Hi, Ralph. - Hey. - Looking good, Ralph. - Thank you. [Baxter scoffs] - Yeah, you're being pathetic. I mean, do you really think that Flash, and Monty, and whoever else is popular around here got that way because of some magical superpowers? I hate to say it, but they got that way all by themselves. - Yeah? Well, I wasn't born with money or muscles like them, okay? So if I gotta find another way to be somebody special or important, then so be it. - You can't use the weapons to make yourself popular, Ralph, that's crazy. - Why is it so crazy? - Because first of all, they're not yours. I mean, they're not toys, somebody made these things for a reason, and I don't think that the reason was for you to get a date with Felicia St. Clair, okay? - Like I told you before, Baxter, the weapons are ours now, we can do whatever we want with them. - Well, you know what? You can keep mine, because I don't even want 'em anymore. - Why not? - Because I don't wanna screw over Monty and Flash and then turn out to be just like them, okay? - Hey, wait a minute! Is that what you think? - Just leave me alone, okay, Ralph? Ah, oh, Monty, I'm really sorry, I didn't see you there, I swear. - Well, today's your lucky day, Thumbelina, 'cause I'm gonna fix it so you never have to worry about bumping into me again. - Really? [tense music] - What do you want, freak? You want me to give you a little of what your dopey friend here's gonna get? - Where's your friends, Monty? It's funny, I don't see 'em around anywhere. - All right, Ralph, you first then. - Yeah, go ahead and do it, Monty! You might be able to beat the stuff outta me, but on the other hand, I might end up beating you to a bloody pulp. - You got a lotta nerve, dork boy. - Do I? Let's get one thing straight, you preppy psycho, if you ever even talk to me or my friend again, I will erase you. I'm gonna do the world a favor and take you right out of the freaking program, just like Chad and Lance. Do you understand me? - Yes. - Yes what? - Sir, yes, sir. - Good. - Ralph. - That one, he spoke of erasing his classmates. Notice how he has changed within the space of a single day. He has our arsenal, I am certain of it. It is time to obtain our ally. [tense music] - What? You three space cadets wanna take a poke at me too? - We have been watching you for a couple of days now. - We think you have potential. - Great potential. - Potential for what? - It has come to our attention that your comrades have disappeared. - Lance and Chad, yeah, they just, like, vanished. Their folks don't even know where they went. - Your comrade Ralph has sent them into a transdimensional gateway flux. - It is a low-grade anti-personnel weapon. It is highly effective with an enemy. - You guys are nuts, you know that? What do you want from me? - We may be able to offer you a chance to exact revenge upon your comrade Ralph, for disintegrating your friends. - Disintegrating my friends? - Yes. - Well, what if I don't believe you guys? [buzzing] - Ordinarily, we reserve such manual tasks as this combat and murder to our worker subordinate class, however, in this case, you will do perfectly. - Oh, man, this is crazy. - We require your help, we need a warrior. - Where do I sign up? - Hey, not bad. - Thanks. - When did you, uh, get into comic-book art? - Comic-book art? - Hey, have you seen Flash yet today? - Nope, not yet, why? - [chuckles] No reason. - I wish I knew who you were. - Sayonara. Don't forget to read chapter 78, on the Hogglespog-Scotch Accord of 1817. It's just fascinating stuff. And also, don't forget to get out those telescopes for tonight's appearance of Jagalon Beta in the sky. The Farmers' Almanac says it will reach perihelion at exactly 11 o'clock, so be sure to stay up for it. Flash Gunderson? What in Betsy's name are you doing here? You're not in my class. - Uh, can I start? - Well, while I can appreciate your newfound fashion sense, I'm afraid it's highly against school policy just to take a class for the gosh darn golly of it. - But... [Mrs. O'Houlihan sighs] I need the grades, Mrs. O'Houlihan. I need them. - But why? Aren't you on the football team? - I quit. And you gotta help me with my grades! - Oh, my goodness. - Teach me. I'll do my homework, I'll read stuff, I'll raise my hand, just put me in the game. - Have you been playing without a helmet again? - Thought I'd find you here. - Thought you didn't wanna have anything to do with me? - Mind if I sit here? - Sure. - Hey, Ralph, you got a light, huh? [Ralph chuckles] See, I knew you'd snap out of it. I've known you for too many years, and who else is gonna put up with you? - You know, in the comic books, some guy gets bit by a radioactive spider, or he shows up from another planet, and bam, you know, he's automatically a superhero. He's fighting crime, he's got a secret identity, it's all set in stone. - Yeah, but this is real life, things don't get set in stone, they just happen. And you get lucky and you're somebody or you bust your hump your whole life and then you're somebody, but nobody's a superhero. You're always gonna be some schmo with problems just like the rest of us. - I think we should get rid of the weapons. - Yeah, maybe we should. - Hey, Ralph, Baxter. - Flash, what are you doing? - What you guys up to, eating lunch? - Uh, hi, Flash. - Wow. - Well, hey, I just wanted to come over and say hi, you know? Oh, hey, I just started an essay on the life of the dung beetle for biology class. Bet you 10 bucks I'm gonna get an A. - Flash? - Hey, I just wanna say hi to the guys, you know? - Sure. - Hey, I just got Dungeon Master 4 on my PC, it rocks. And if you think you maybe wanna come over and check it out... - Uh... Not today, but thanks, Flash. - Well, hey, that's cool. I'll catch you later. - Are you feeling okay? [tense music] - Ralph, I'm scared. - Yeah, we definitely gotta take the stuff back. Let's just put it back in the room in the basement and forget we ever saw it. - Yeah, sounds like a plan. - We will execute our plans tonight. I want our ally to follow these two and retrieve our power source. - And it must be done discreetly, after school. - You know, I was watching The Phenomenon Factor on TV last night, and the main guys found this spaceship in a secret government vault in a mountain in Sweet Valley, Wisconsin. This could be the same thing. - You think this stuff came from outer space? - That's what I'm saying, maybe it is. I mean, maybe, like, the Incas buried it under the school or something. - But the Incas weren't aliens. - No, but they, like, hung out with aliens. Remember Chariots of the Gods? - I think I can safely say that the Incas were not involved. - [sighs] Well, I was thinking, what if it was aliens, and what if they were upset with us 'cause we took their stuff and they were coming back to get it? - Whoa. [tense music] - [Baxter] I'm just asking. - Well, I don't know. Okay, one thing at a time. What's he doing here? - [Baxter] I don't know, but I'm gonna guess he's not here for the nice view. - Hi, kids. How's it going? - What do you want, Monty? - You know, you two Kentucky-fried morons had me going for a minute. Ralph here slams me up against a tree and I'm thinking, "Geez, this guy's grown himself some guts," but guys like you don't have any guts, do you, Ralph? - I'm not afraid of you anymore, Monty, so you can just deal with it. - Oh, I'll deal with it, and while I'm at it, I'm pretty much planning on using your head as a freaking skull keg. [electricity buzzes] You should see the look on your faces. Big surprise, huh? Looks like I found out what made you a tough guy, Ralph. - That's not one of ours. - See, I also found out what you two little wimps did to Lance and Chad, and I'm not happy, mm-mm. - And what are you gonna do to us? - Well, my new bosses told me I had to get a little info outta you two, and once I do that, then I'm pretty much free to make you wish you'd never been born. When are you two gonna learn? Nobody messes with me, nobody. [fires gun] [fires gun] - You okay, Baxter? - Yeah. - Where are you buttheads hiding the alien arsenal? - What? Alien arsenal? - You heard me. - We don't know what you're talking about. - Yeah, right. Listen up, sports fans, you don't tell me where the arsenal is, then I guess I'm gonna have to string your guts all over this lot. You like? - Hey, say hi to Chad and Lance for me. [fires gun] [beam ricochets] [siren blares] Oh, boy. - Guess your little space gun doesn't work on this armor. [siren nears] You got lucky. Bring the arsenal to school at 10 tonight, they want their stuff back, especially their crystal ball. You try anything stupid or if you don't show up, I'm coming out to get you. - We gotta split, Ralph, cops. - This is bad. I haven't even seen Mr. Lipkis and all the bricks are outta place, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that somebody found this place. - So the stuff was made by aliens, Monty has superpowers, and our secret room has pretty much been busted, did I miss anything? [chuckles] Oh, yeah, that part about us being up a creek without a paddle. [computer beeps] Oh, and even better, there's only five slashes left. Look, we figured out that slashes mean hours, right? So if this is a clock, especially one that runs by hours, then it should turn over and start again after 24 slashes, right? - Maybe it's on alien time. - No, it's on our time, and it goes by hours, and there's only five hours left. So if it's six o'clock now, then at 11, all the slashes are gone. Dude, this isn't a clock, it's a countdown. - What happens at 11? - Well, remember what Mrs. O'Houlihan was talking about? Jagalon Beta is supposed to be visible in the night sky at 11 o'clock, so whatever's going down probably has something to do with that. - So what do we do about Monty and whoever gave Monty the armor? - It has to be those weird new kids. - We're gonna have to come out of retirement and use the weapons to fight these guys. - No, Ralph, we have to call in the Army or something, we are so out of our league. - We don't have a choice. If we don't stop Monty and whoever those new kids are, I don't even wanna think about what's gonna happen. - "The financial structure and a pre-industrial democracy." I just don't get it. - Flash? What on earth are you doing here? - Felicia. [chuckles] Uh, hi. - Do you realize it's almost 10:30 at night? I've been looking for you everywhere. - I was, um, catching up on some studying. [Felicia chuckles] - You're in school instead of a party on Friday night? Flash, what's going on? - Can't you see how important the political climate of the 1800s is to me? - Listen, I think it's time you and I had a talk. I don't know what happened to you in the past couple of days, and I'm really not sure I wanna know. - I'm just getting my act together. You know, knowledge is power, and all that stuff. [tense music] - No sign of Monty. - Maybe he's downstairs where the weapons were. - No, he's waiting up here somewhere for us, bet on it. - I think now would be a good time to check your locker. - But I guess I realize that we're just not right for each other. And there's someone else-- - You know what? I am so glad that you said that, honey, because I've been wanting to tell you that I've sort of been looking for somebody who fulfills my intellectual needs. - Your intellectual needs? - Hey, don't take this bad, okay? I mean, we can still have a caring, nurturing, platonic relationship. You know? - Right. [tense music] - Is the device ready? - We have set it up in the arsenal chamber. - When the two thieves arrive with our power source, we should eliminate them before they cause us more trouble. - That is what our warrior is for. - Felicia? - I just heard somebody walking down the hallway. - Oh, don't worry about it, it was probably the night janitor, he let me in earlier. - It didn't sound like it, I'm gonna go check it out real quick. - I'll go with you. [tense music] - No sign of him. - Maybe he forgot. - No, [Baxter sighs] he didn't forget. - Oh, god. - You buttheads hid the stuff in your lockers? No imagination. So now that my bosses have what they want, I guess it's time for me to get what I want, blood, lots of blood. [Monty grunts] [Baxter groans] [Ralph grunts] [Monty groans] [Monty fires gun] [Ralph groans] [Ralph groans] - Oh, my god, I think that alien looks just like Monty. [fires gun] - [Phil] Now, bring us the power source now. - You got it, boss. Don't even think about following me, you freaking losers, or I'm gonna fry the jock and your little girlfriend here. - Hey, I swear, I'll do that extra credit. - Move it! Come on, let's go! - You okay, Ralph? [punches locker] - My arm has lost its superpowers. - Oh, that's okay, I think I'm still good to go here. [sighs] Uh-oh. - Monty must've damaged your power supply during the fight. - What are you doing? - It's 10:40 now, that star thing we were talking about happens in 20 minutes, so I gotta find Monty before he does something bad to Flash and Felicia. - Yeah, well, we're about an hour past bad. [tense music] - Why have you brought these two humans with you? - Who are you guys? - I had to take these two pep-squad rejects hostage. [goggles power up] - Anyway, this still works. We're gonna have to use these to find those guys. They could be anywhere in the building. - Man, we're totally tapped. - Listen, you go one way and I'll go the other, we can use the goggles to look through the classrooms to find those guys, and we'll keep in touch on the communicators. - What about the two thieves? Did you eliminate them? - Hey, you guys told me to get my butt here. Anyway, I ripped 'em up pretty good, their weapons and stuff don't work anymore. [goggles power up] [goggles power up] [tense music] - [communicator beeps] Ralph, I've been up and down this part of the hall and I don't see anything. - [communicator beeps] Me either. - What should we do? - Well, they probably went this way, so chances are I'll see them first. - [communicator beeps] Listen, I've got a hunch. - We only have a few minutes until our home world is aligned with Earth and we can download the Armageddon beam. - Give us the power supply. [communicator beeps] - Ralph, we only have about five minutes before Jagalon Beta's in view. [tense music] [electricity buzzes] [goggles power up] [communicator beeps] I see them. - [communicator beeps] Where are they? - [communicator beeps] My hunch was right, they're all in the arsenal. [goggles power up] Monty, Flash, Felicia, and the new kids. - At last, we may fulfill our destiny. - [communicator beeps] And guess what, something bad's about to go down. - [communicator beeps] I'll be right there. - We don't have time. [exhales] I'm gonna go for it. - Prepare for the elimination of all life on your planet. - Hey, wait a minute, you guys didn't tell me you were gonna use this stuff to kill everything on the planet. - We are only interested in destroying human beings. Since you lack any characteristics of a human being, your life will be spared. - Oh, well, that's cool then. - Oh, hi. Did I already miss everything? - Have no fear, in approximately three minutes, you will never have to see us again. - Aww, you guys going on a long trip? - No, but you and the rest of mankind will be. [fires gun] - Oh, boy. - Comrade Monty, please take care of this creature. - No. - Two minutes until our home world is aligned with Earth. - [communicator beeps] Baxter? Shoot. - Comrade Ralph, do you honestly believe you can stop us now? - Ralph, you saved me in art class yesterday? - Wait a minute, this Ralph guy is from the planet Mandark? - Let me handle this loser. - Go ahead, Monty, I already told you I'm not afraid of you anymore. - You don't have any superpowers to save your butt now, Ralph. Guess you're gonna, like, I don't know, die. Yeah, this feels great, I haven't strangled anybody all week. [Monty groans] - You may have stopped Comrade Monty, but your fate is still sealed. It's time, activate the Armageddon device. [whooshing] - Not so fast. - Foolish creature, that device will not harm us. - Maybe not, but it'll do a number on your old crystal ball thingy there. [fires gun] [lightning strikes] [aliens moan] - I'll be back! [upbeat music] [computer beeps] [Ralph exhales] - Am I nuts, or did I just save the world? - Yeah, you're nuts, but you did sorta save the world. - Wow. - I cannot believe it was you the whole time. You shoulda said something earlier. - Why? - 'Cause we coulda gotten to this part a whole lot sooner. - You know, that was a messed-up trick you and your buddy pulled on me, I should just stand here for six hours and beat your face into a new, exciting shape, but, that's the old me, the new me has to get ready for the big Math-A-Thon next week. I'm gonna cream West Side High's butt. See ya. Oh, yeah, you two are still invited to come over and play Dungeon Master 4, if you wanna. You too, Felicia. See ya. - You know, I don't think I'm ever gonna get used to that. [Felicia chuckles] [bell rings] - What do you suppose that is? - I don't know. Maybe an old bomb shelter? If it ain't in the plans, we tear it down. - [chuckles] Hey, [tense music] here's a neat little doohicky. Ain't it neat? Ah, the kids will love it. [construction worker chuckles] - Yeah. - All right, guys, let's get to work, huh? Let's get started. - [claps] Let's go. [computer beeps] [tense music] [intense music]
