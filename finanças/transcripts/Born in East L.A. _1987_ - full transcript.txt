You know, and I don't even know what he looks like. My mother says, 90 to the factory and pick him up. You know, I won't lie to you, he's probably an illegal. So anyways, I went to the factory to look for him, and he's not even there and so I'm walking around in the middle of the factory, all of a sudden there's a goddamn immigration raid. The doors fly open and all these guys come bustin' in. And then they think that I'm an illegal, and they grab me and throw me in the bus! Hey, I want to make a complaint about that officer right now, man. This guy was not only rude, he was degrading. So anyway, they throw me in the bus and they deport me. They bring me down here, so here I am and all I want to do is go home now, okay? - Well, that's a real interesting story. Now, would you mind repeating it so somebody as slow as I am can understand? - Okay. Okay. I went down to pick up my cousin. I don't even know my cousin. I was walking around-- - Okay, okay.

Guadalupe Rudolfo Robles. - Okay, Rudy, can you show me some I.D.? - See, that's the problem, I don't have any I.D. I walked out of the house without my wallet. It's probably just sitting there in the living room right now, you could send somebody home with me and it's probably just there. - I don't think that'll be necessary. Guadalupe Rudolfo Robles, age 57. Arrested three times in San Diego, twice in Los Angeles, three times in Santa Ana. Once you made it all the way up to San Francisco. You sure like cities named after saints. - What are you talking about? - Returned to Mexico as an illegal alien nine times. I think we'll make that 10. - What are you talking about, 57, I'm not 57. I don't care what your damn computer says. - Then show me some I.D. - I don't have any I.D., all I got in my pants is my dick and 25 cents. - Then you have enough to make a phone call.
