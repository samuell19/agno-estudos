You dance so well. Amazing! Now you have started dancing on your toes. It's all thanks to you, Mr. Professor. I'm not capable of dancing on my toes. I have taught many great people. You just need someone to make you dance. And the world dances. You are great, Mr. Professor. - You found out now? - Yes. Ma'am has a problem. Master. - Now our company won't go bankrupt. - Here. Thanks. Master, here. Have some tobacco from Banaras. Wow! Those who consume it die. Those who don't also die. The creator has created such an amazing thing. Whom are you praising? Nothing. I am praising this tobacco. It's bitter and yet gives you a high. Its smell is so strong that your mouth reeks. This tobacco. Is that so? Ma'am has a problem. That's not something to play with. Give it to me. Talk from a distance, Mr. Professor. I don't like scuffles. Look, uncle. What a beautiful necklace! Shall I buy it for Rs.5? Yes, dear. Why didn't you say five pennies? Give me my necklace. You want to buy a pearl necklace. Fine. Take Rs.10. Right, uncle? Rs.10. As if you are buying vegetables. You silly girl. Each pearl is worth not less than Rs.500. - Rs.500. - Yes. So why didn't you say Rs.5000? Ask him from where he got so much money? You stole it? If you committed theft, you've slandered yourself. Take your necklace. Why do you get angry, Roopa? I have kept it for you. You can take it whenever you want. I don't want your necklace. You tell me, uncle. Have I ever taken anything for free? Free, my foot. People splurge such necklaces on you adoringly. I am telling you. You can take it whenever you want. I don't want it. Keep your precious necklace with you. - See that it's not stolen. - What? Uncle, come this side. Tea. Here. Sweet balls for you. - Quiet. Someone will hear. - So what if someone hears? Eat it for my sake. Uncle. Shall be back on Thursday. Cold drink. Today's newspaper. Did you see, uncle? Clean body. Clean heart. He seems so neat and clean. Yes, dear. Seems to belong to a decent family. - Decent family? - Yes. That's why he didn't look up even once. Talk about yourself. You were staring at him as if you will devour him. Why are you feeling envious? Uncle, I liked him. So I was looking at him. Master, tell Roopa. One can't judge what's good and what's bad... by staring. - But by assessing. - Look. Why is the train halting? Why are the police coming here? - They must be searching for a thief. - Thief? Ram Singh! - Get me water. - Yes, sir. Thanks. After so many days, I got to drink cold water. Have some more. What do I tell you, sir? I've been investigating a case for so long. These thieves and robbers have harassed me tremendously. There are thefts every other day. And we have 'to wander through villages and trains. Sir, we have just received news that a pearl necklace is missing. And the amazing thing is that it has been stolen so cleverly... that you're flabbergasted. But sir, theft can't be hidden. No matter how hard one tries. You are right. Yes. But the thief only thinks about the present. Future holds misfortunes for him. Did you burn your fingers? Fingers? Right now my heart is anxious. You see, inspector. These days I remain preoccupied. Yes, sir. Your world is strange. If I ever get a chance, I will come to see your show. Do come. He is our master. Expert drum player. And she is Ms. Roopa. A living example of beauty and talent. Inspector. - May I ask you something? - Yes. You can. If the necklace thief is caught, what punishment will he get? Punishment? He will rot in prison for seven years. - Rot? - Yes. - Won't he be whipped? - Yes. He will be whipped too. He will come to his senses. Once we nab him. Yes. Listen. Thanks. Where are you going? Santosh Nagar. What a place, sir! Small hills. Gushing, flowing, charming river. It's a strange place. Maybe you are going there for a vacation. No. I am going there for work. I am an engineer. And my company wants to build... a new town near Santosh Nagar. There will be schools, hospitals... parks for children. - All things in the world... - What a beautiful dream! Yes. That's true. - In your dream town... - Can I get a place, engineer? What did I say, uncle? Did I make a mistake? What mistake? Look, engineer. We should also get a place in your town. Yes. Surely. Look, I will give you a form. - Yes. - Fill it and then submit it. - Here. - Thanks. - Listen. - Yes. - The form. - Yes. - Okay, sir. Pleased to meet you. - Yes. Porter. If you ever need me, do come. - I'll be pleased to meet you. - What? Yes. Certainly. Come to the police station whenever you want. - Police station. - That's home for me. Okay. Thanks. Do come. Okay. Porter, come here. Sir, I am pleased to meet you. I don't feel like leaving you. We ate together, sat together, traveled together in the train. And yet I didn't ask you your name. - My name is Ratan. - Ratan. You are truly a gem. - Pardon me. My name is Biharilal Professor. - Okay. And I am the owner of this small company. - This musical company? - Yes. - Okay. I am the owner, producer, director. Everything. Okay, tell me. Where are you staying? - Dilkhush Hotel. - Dilkhush Hotel. Great! Town is Santosh Nagar. - Hotel is Dilkhush. And your name is... - Ratan. - So do you know her? - I.. This lady. My name is Roopa. - Okay. I will leave now. - Wait, sir. You still didn't hear my company's praises. As such, it's a small company. But I swear. In whichever city we go, we receive tremendous applause. - I will leave now. - Listen to me. Look, it is 1 o'clock. I am in a hurry. Okay. So you are really leaving. Roopa. He took the necklace. And you are just standing here. Tell me. How can I help you? If you say, shall I call the inspector? What will you call him? I will call him myself. Didn't you hear? He will be sentenced for seven years. He will have to rot there. He will be whipped. Why should he rot? Is he a thief? Or you are a thief? You will know right away. - Inspector. - No. Wait. I have some work with you. Tell me, Mr. Professor? What work do you have? I will just come. - Are you going or not? - Yes. I am going. Ma'am has a problem. Thief! After all, where do you want to go? Wish you could know where I want to go. Look, I don't understand riddles. Tell me clearly. The driver will drop you wherever you want to go. Hey! Listen! - I don't want to hear anything. - But listen to me. Engineer. Listen to me, engineer. Helplessness makes a person go crazy. When I came, I had fever. And now I am feeling cold. - You have fever? - No. I feel cold. Listen. Give me your coat. Oh! Coat. - Here. Sweater. - This? I won't feel warm if I wear this. - I want your coat. - This will protect you from cold. No. Only a coat can protect me from cold. You see, this is another kind of cold. Where are you going, leaving me in trouble? Engineer, you can leave me wherever you want. But this jungle... Thanks. - Driver, let's go. - And you? - I am fine. - Driver, stop the car. - Let's go. - I said stop the car. If you don't like to sit with me, I will get down. - Take your precious sweater. - Let's go. Listen. - The station is far. - So what can I do? You only said not to leave you in trouble. If you want, I can drop you to the station. - Yes. But on one condition. - Yes? - You will sit with me in the car. - Fine. Let's go. - Come. - Let's go. Driver, let's go. Love is shining in your eyes. Love is shining in my eyes? This is the same love in the quest of which people wander around. They go crazy. Roopa. Your face reveals you don't like this man. And you can't even ignore him. - What about the necklace? - What else? For your necklace, I played a charade, I swore and lied... Ma'am has a problem. You played a charade. You moved heaven and earth. You toiled hard. But give me my necklace. - But I didn't get your necklace. - You didn't? Ma'am has a problem. What joke is this? How did you return without the necklace? Give me my necklace. He is not a thief that I would have... snatched the necklace from him. You will know. He will rot in prison. If I don't teach him a lesson, my name is not Bihari. I will go to the inspector. Don't get angry. Anger is bad. - You? - People call me Mr. Diwan. I am a small landlord here. You are in trouble. Yes. I am in trouble. If I could get a place to stay and some space to perform... my problem will be solved. I will solve your problem. Come with me. A good deed needs no permission. Let's go. Bhola. You are silent since 16 years. Won't you speak at all? Why do you rub salt on my wounds? Puff away your sorrow. Nanhi used to play with it. It's been 16 years since we lost Nanhi. Look. Roopa. Sorry. I came here by mistake. Roopa, you have come to ask something. How do you do? How are you? From where is this sound coming? How are you? - It speaks. - It chatters too. You are insulting me. Yes. How are you? I am fine. Did you see these shoes? Seems to be of a kid. She used to wear it 16 years ago. - It belongs to Nanhi? - Yes. Keep quiet. Yes. What did you want to ask? How far is Dilkhush hotel from here? It's about 2-3 miles from here. Your eyes reveal you want to reach there as soon as possible. - Yes. - You are craving to meet someone. Professor. Hello, Mr. Diwan. Do you have any problem in my house? What problem can I have when you are there? - I'm just preparing for the show. - Hello. - Hello, inspector. - Hello, Chandu. Hello. How are you?

My beloved took away my innocent heart. Look. He didn't heed me. He didn't listen to me. I had no say in front of the tyrant. I was left wondering. What did you do? My beloved took away my innocent heart. Look. My beloved took away my innocent heart. Look. I didn't know my beloved is a thief too. He is not only a thief, but something else too. He stole my heart as well as my solace. Look. My beloved took away my innocent heart. Look. - Did you like the performance? - Yes. But now permit me to leave. It's quite late. Look, do come tomorrow. - If you say, I will come. - Okay. Oh no! I will come. - Look, don't forget. Or else I'll be dejected. - Okay. - What? - Yes. Yes? Listen. Bye. I said look here too. Move. You are bad. How charmingly you said move! As if I am nobody. Yes. Damsels are not trustworthy. In a moment a dear one becomes a stranger. Ma'am has a problem. - Give me my necklace. - Necklace? There is a limit of patience, Roopa. You don't know how restless I am to see the necklace. Uncle, tell him. To return the necklace to its real owner. I am the real owner. - It's not your necklace. - So whose is it? Roopa is right. You won't benefit from such a possession. You should have taken my side. You are supporting her. If the company suffers a loss, I compensate. If an artist goes missing, I search for him here and there. I bought the necklace with great difficulty. And somebody else should get it. Roopa... return the necklace. - Give me my necklace. - Take your precious necklace. Wait. I'll be right there. Wait. I dupe wise men. And she dupes me. Ma'am has a problem. No problem, Roopa. Keep it with you. Maybe under this pretext you will think of me. I don't know who took it. It was here just now. Nobody must have taken it. You must have given it to someone. This is called brazen theft. Look, you are accusing me. I didn't give the necklace to anyone. Believe me, Mr. Professor. The necklace is missing. I know your excuses very well. You have the necklace. Did you understand? Uncle, the necklace is lost. Lie. Deceit. Fraud. Are you teaching me? Uncle, tell her clearly. If I don't get my necklace by tomorrow... there will be no one worse than me. Did you understand? You performed many tricks to console your heart. But to no avail. You are again missing Nanhi today. Tell me, Nanhi. How are you? Chandu, her name is Roopa. Not Nanhi. I will call her Nanhi. What problem do you have? When her name is Roopa, why will you call her Nanhi? You can call me Nanhi. Did you see, Mr. Diwan? I convinced her. She is a kin. Chandu is right. I have come to you considering you as my family. Nanhi, have dinner. Come. Chandu, shall I ask you something? Yes. Who has stopped you? It's such a big house. You live here alone? - It's entirely his fault. - Quiet. He is used to living alone. Don't you feel anxious? He has learnt countless tricks to console his heart. - Chandu, will you eat? - I don't eat. - Why don't you eat? - I don't feel hungry. - Why don't you feel hungry? - I don't get ration. - Why don't you get ration? - I don't have money. Bhola, take him. Nanhi, see Nanhi's clothes before you go home. This night, the rains and this loneliness. Come in. This night, the rains and this loneliness. What if someone comes suddenly? Hello. Mr. Professor, tell me. What brings you here? - I told Roopa. - Yes. - To go to the engineer. - Yes. Oh, no! But she said, No, Mr. Professor. You only go. And tell him. I explained to her a lot. But she didn't listen to me. - Yes, engineer. Roopa wants the necklace. - Necklace? Yes. Tomorrow we are going to perform 'Hamlet of Heart'. You have also come to establish a settlement. - Do come. - Yes. Certainly. - Necklace. Yes. Have a seat. I will bring the necklace. Sir has a problem. Engineer, it's locked. If you bring the key... Key? I will get it. Oh, no! Mr. Professor. Yes. What happened? I have kept the necklace in the bank. - What? - Yes. - In the bank? - This is a hotel. Things can be misplaced here. I might keep it somewhere and then forget about it. That's why. Let it be. I will bring it tomorrow. - Fine. Tomorrow. Without fail. - Without fail. - Sure? - Yes. Absolutely sure. - Okay. So remember tomorrow. - Yes. - Boy. - Yes, sir. - Lemon please. - Yes, sir. - I found the necklace. - Who had it? Ask who has it? Your engineer will bring the necklace tomorrow. How did it reach to him? Why did you go there? Who told you? Your name can be used everywhere. So I used your name and went there. You tricked an expert player like me. - Say yes, Lachcho. - No. - Say yes. - No. Say yes, Lachcho. You said no so gracefully. Wow! Lachcho. - You're afraid of me. Should you fear a dear one? - Lachcho. Hello. Did you see Lachcho anywhere? You think I am Lachcho's bodyguard? Your Lachcho is there. Go. Thanks. I forgot to say thanks. Silly man. He says thanks all the time. And listen. I asked him whether he will surely bring it tomorrow. He said absolutely sure. Stay away from him. He might ruin you. - Understood? - Okay. - Okay. My Lachcho. There is consent as well as refusal in these mesmerizing eyes. Lachcho. - At least talk to me. - No. No. Listen to me, my darling. Lachcho. They have turned the house into a zoo. Lachcho. Did you see my Lachcho? - You think I'm an inquiry officer? - Thanks. Lachchi. Lachchi, get up. We have to go to the hotel. Why? We have to go and tell him that I didn't ask for any necklace. Why don't you go alone? Look, my heart is weak. Listen, he is in room number 27. Get up. And look, don't talk too much with him. He is mentally../ Go. Go. Good girl. Go. Yes. Come in. She said... Wait. Bring another cup of tea. Have tea. - She is outside. - Who? That person. - Not here. There. - Where? Downstairs. Thank you. I didn't ask for any necklace. Why do you take the trouble? - I speak the truth. - What truth? - Necklace. - I don't need your necklace. I also don't need your necklace. Wait. I will get the key. - What? Listen. Key? - Yes. Key. In that chest. I mean, that drawer. - What? - Necklace. Oh no! No! I mean key. Here is the key. Key? What key? Which key? What do you want? It's the key of that drawer where your necklace is kept. - I don't want the necklace. - Come. - I told you. - Come. Come. - Here's your necklace. - Yes. It's yours? I found it in the car yesterday. Car? How come it was in the car? Under the seat. When yesterday because of you the car... And you got... I am so sorry. It must have fallen then. Here. You keep it. No, no, I don't want it. - Here. - No. - I want you to keep it. - No. I don't want it. You take it. Take it, and give it to her. What's this? You won't take it. Take it. What's she doing? Laxmi's saying she won't take this necklace. - You can keep it. - No. Not once, twice, or a hundred times. Take it. - Open it. - No, no, no. Let go. No need to fight. Look, this necklace belongs to someone. Keep it somewhere safe. Then, I'll keep it at the bank. Listen. If anyone asks about the necklace, just deny having it. - Okay. - Yes. Wait. Tea's waiting, Come. Oh, look what I did. - It's okay, the cup's over brimmed. - No. I'm brimming with joy. - I want to sing today, - Sing. And you'll say No, no, no. No. I'll certainly hear you sing today. Come on. One. Two. Tick-tock... - Hey! - What? Not this song. Lachcho! Hello. Have you seen my Lachcho? Who do you think I am? Always looking for Lachcho. You're such a grownup man. But you can't take care of a little woman. She ran away with someone. Who did she run away with? What should I do if she did? Get out. - I forgot to say thank you. - Get lost. I am harassed. Where's Roopa? - Did she run away with someone? - Yes. She must have gone to see that engineer at the hotel. Get that. I'm being fooled. Your love has spoilt her. I've been waiting for her since morning. - Get that. - I see. Lachcho. Don't talk about separating. - I've a delicate heart. - I see. No, just say yes. My beautiful darling. Just say yes. Lachchi. Where's Roopa? What are you doing? Where's Roopa? You dwell in my heart. Come in my dreams. I miss you every day Just like the flute echoes by the side of the river You're always in my thoughts. You steal my heart. You cause an upheaval in my heart. You dwell in my heart. Come in my dreams. You're the only one I am living for Just like the moon in the sky You dwell in my eyes. Steal my senses. You dwell in my eyes. Steal my senses. You cause an upheaval in my heart. You dwell in my heart. Come in my dreams. You cause an upheaval in my heart. Grandpa, I'm really happy today. He'll be coming tonight. I will sing for him. I will dance for him. I'll go crazy for him, grandpa. Dear, my happiness lies with yours. My dear grandpa, you are so good. I saw a beautiful dream today. I heard my beloved's voice resonate in my ears. Bless me. So that I can make him mine. - Who'll take her? - You're asking that. - Go, Lachchi's in that room. - Thank you. What are you doing? What did you do, Lachchi? You shattered my dream. You don't know, the world I had created. It was just him in it. - We were talking about love. - Then? He touched my soul. My heart was filled with desires... and I could hear the tune of love. He came forward to take me in his arms.. And you woke me up. It's too late. - Get some sleep. - No. If I sleep he will go away. I will keep my eyes open. He'll hide, and I'll find him. I'll call out Beloved, where are you. Where are you beloved? And he'll say, Here I am. Then, he'll come out of hiding. And I will take him in my arms. And say... Don't torment me. O beloved, don't leave now. Don't leave me. Don't torment me. O beloved, don't leave now. Don't leave me. For the sake of this heart. Don't leave after torturing my heart. O beloved, don't leave now. You've given my heart a sweet pain. My heart's at your feet. Don't forsake it and leave. O beloved, don't leave now. Don't torment me. O beloved, don't leave now. For the sake of this heart. Don't leave after torturing my heart. O beloved, don't leave now. Your style was a treat to my eyes. Now they say, don't leave after tormenting them. O beloved, don't leave now. Don't torment me. O beloved, don't leave now. For the sake of this heart. Don't leave after torturing my heart. O beloved, don't leave now. Limbo. Zimbo. Abracadabra, hocus-pocus. Limbo. Zimbo. Move aside, we're the enchanting beauties. We steal hearts with our eyes. My gait creates an uproar in the city. Men stare at me like wildcats. Like wildcats. Lachcho. I'm completely ruined, and have become useless. Beware, you've locked horns with us. Lachcho. I'll treat you to hot snacks. We steal hearts with our eyes. Move aside, we're the enchanting beauties. We steal hearts with our eyes. The world's at my feet. Some say, my eyes pierce their heart. Some say, I can count the stars all night waiting for you. Mister, you seem in trouble. But my beloved doesn't talk to me. Even the moon's crazy for us. We steal hearts with your eyes. Move aside, we're the enchanting beauties. We steal hearts with your eyes. This is the place we want to beautify. Across this river. Between the green trees... we will build a beautiful township. And, it'll be covered by a beautiful mountain range. That's all you people ever think of. Mr. Engineer. - We'll have boats here as well. - Yes, Roopa. And, lovers riding these boats... will float away far and wide, lost in their world. To the place, from where they can't return. Look, Roopa. The clouds here. It'll rain soon. Let's go. The car's stuck. You'll get drenched. You're drenched too. You look take such great care of me. I'll help you. This car won't budge. Look. There's a hut. - Let's go there. - Let's go. Come in, mister. You're completely drenched. - It's raining so heavily. - Right. And my car's stuck too. Take a seat, I'll get some clothes for you. No, I'll manage everything. No need to take the trouble. Roopa hasn't returned yet. You don't stop her either. Why would you? Because you've raised her with great love... She's being spoilt. What are you saying, professor. Don't you know Roopa's my daughter? If she was your daughter... she wouldn't be roaming so freely. If you can't stop her, then I will. I will go talk to that engineer. Lachcho. If you say Lachcho again, I'll... Hello. - Have you see Lachcho? - Again. I'll slap you silly. Get out you big mug. Get out. I am in love with someone. You're in love? These clothes look nice. - You're looking nice. - You mean me. - Listen. - Yes. - I'm hungry. - Hungry. I am hungry too. So? - So? - Cook some food. Cook? Me? Okay. I will for you. - One more. - Here. Wow. The food's tasty. I didn't know you could cook so well. Daughter-in-law's cooked such tasty food. Daughter-in-law? God's blessed you with such a talented wife. - Wife? - Yes. Though she's educated... she's so good with the household chores. Why are you staring at me? Why, can't I look? - Here. - I ate too much. You haven't eaten anything. The radish is uneaten, so are the tomatoes, and the lentils. Eat it. Fine, I'll eat some more. Roopa. I didn't know you were so talented. Till now, I thought you're only an artist. But now, I realize you're very talented. - I will never forget this day. - Yes, Roopa. I will remember this day too. - Uncle. - Yes, daughter-in-law. What's the cradle doing here? I had a young daughter. Now, all I have are her memories. - What happened to your daughter? - Don't ask. This is her shoe. I hope she stays happy. Roopa. It's stopped raining. We should leave. - Get ready. - Okay. We've sworn on love. We'll never separate. We've sworn on love. We will keep our promises. We'll make our own world. We'll sing the song of love. We'll sing... We'll sing the song of love. Our love will keep growing. We'll never separate. We've sworn on love. The world might trouble us. They might try to instigate. But, we'll live together always. We'll always be holding hands. We'll sing the song of love. We'll sing... We'll sing the song of love. Our love will keep growing. We'll never separate. We've sworn on love. He said yes. My life's changed. It was raining heavily. We took shelter in a hut. I cooked food for him. I fed him. He's coming tomorrow. Oh, yes. There was a cradle there. And it had this shoe. Take a look. This shoe belongs to my Nanhi. Where did you find it? Who lives there? Mr. Engineer. - Mr. Engineer. - Yes. Telegram for you. I was awake to give this to you. Is everything fine? I've to leave for the station right now. What time does the train leave? - Train for Delhi 45:12. - You mean 12:45. And the train for Mumbai, 15... - Minutes. And hours? - 12. And right now, it's 5:12. - That means, just 10 minutes for the train to leave. - Yes. - Then, I am leaving. - When will you return? - As soon as I can. - But, where are you going? - Mumbai. Mumbai. Yes. - Do you see the professor there? - Yes. I think he's here to see you. - If he asks you for anything, don't say no. - Yes. - Manager. - Yes. - Yes. - Where's the Engineer? - He just went to the station. - Station? - Yes. Which room do you want? - Single or double? - I want a taxi. I can't get you a taxi now. If you can't get me a taxi, who can? Fine, come on. Lachchi. He's coming tomorrow, - Who? - Him. The one that dwells in my heartbeats. The one I used to play hide and seek with. The one that filled my life with love. He's coming tomorrow. He's not coming. He betrayed us all. He was bound to leave, but he took my necklace too. If the train hadn't left... I would've taught him a good lesson. Are you listening? The one you loved has left. No, no. That's not it. He cannot deceive anyone. You can sit and chant his name. - He ran away. - Why will he? He's no thief. That's what I am here to ask. Why did the engineer leave so suddenly? Did he leave me? But he said he's coming tomorrow. - So, why did he leave? - Even I want to know. Why did the engineer leave? And, why did the professor wanted to see him? I don't know. I've lost everything. Professor. Where? What happened then? One day she left Nanhi and left? While dying she said... that he misunderstood me, that he misjudged me. Wonder what grief was eating her from inside. She held herself responsible for all the sins and died. And Nanhi, what about her? Nanhi. She fell prey to my helplessness. Poverty is a big sin. I handed him over to a man who could raise her. Can you recognize that man? Of course I will. My eyes are waiting to see her as well. She must be a grown up now. - Roopa. - Call her back. All I asked him was my love. Why was my world ruined before I could get happiness? Go, call him. And tell him I cannot live without him. He can go away from me, but not my heart. In life, we get happiness and sorrows. Those who help you in happiness... desert you in your sorrows. Get up, dear. Get up. And forget your sorrows with your music. How can I grandpa? I don't feel like singing now. That's a lie. You ask me, beloved, how I am. And, you called this restless soul your relief. He's sent you a telegram. He says, I can't come because I am busy. You're in great pain. He's trying to fool us. He's trying to deceive us by sending telegrams. He says, I apologize. That's the limit to betrayal. Master. Prepare to leave. His engineer won't come. The company's falling apart. Who asked her to fall in love with him? Now do you see the consequences? - So, dear? - I can't sing. I can't dance. I am heart broken. Dear, music is our life. And it cannot be separated from us. Dear. I stopped thinking about my beloved. But, I couldn't hide my pain. You forgot me. But I couldn't forget his memories. My heart was shattered, it was destiny. Why curse my fate. I wasn't destined to any relief. Why curse my fate. If it's difficult to see my beloved. Why would I desire you? If I wasn't worthy of love. Why would I claim of being in love? My heart was shattered, it was destiny. The heart's stop being restless. The eyes have stopped crying. I've become a laughing stock. So, how could I display my love. My heart was shattered, it was destiny. It couldn't get a moment of peace. And, couldn't convey its love. And couldn't dwell in my eyes. What would I do with this ocean of love? My heart was shattered, it was destiny. Why curse my fate. My heart was shattered, it was destiny. Nanhi's mother would suffer similarly. 16 years ago, she would call out similarly. Call him back. But... but, you didn't go anywhere, to come back. You were drunk. Quiet! Those who immerse their life in alcohol... never get out of it. She would cry seeing you. She tried stopping you. But you didn't listen. And, your habit won. Your wife's leaving the house... with your daughter. Stop her. Lachcho. Come here. Telegram for you. Can you read it? Do you want me to read it? Sit down. Don't you want to hear? He writes. I love you. I've surrendered everything to you. What are you looking at? - From where? - Don't try to pretend. Your one and only, Ratan. He wants to meet you. Do you know where? Far away from the city, alone. But listen, don't tell Roopa about it. Otherwise, she will eat you alive. How fortunate you are? She's the one in grief, and you're having fun. Listen. Don't let your husband know. Or else he'll create a scene. Why did he call me? Was his love for Roopa fake. I can't see Roopa in pain. Bhola. He has called. Me. Dear. Roopa. Won't you talk to your grandpa? You look lost. You've forgotten to smile as well. He's the one. I had handed over Nanhi to him 16 years ago. Is Roopa my Nanhi? - Yes, sir. - My Nanhi. Lachcho. You know, Roopa's Nanhi. But, Roopa's no longer herself. Love has made her sad. If she asks about her mother, what will you say? I will call Babu. Here's a telegram for you. Lachcho! Have you seen Lachcho? - You mean Lachchi. - Yes, Lachchi. Wonder where she is. I looked everywhere. Even her room. - I wonder where she is. - Your Lachchi... Yes, Lachchi. Where is she? Tell me. Lachcho. - Grandpa. - Yes. - There's a telegram. - Telegram? The engineer's sent it for Lachchi. Roopa. There's a telegram. No need to read it. I know what's written. The telegram's for Lachchi, not you. Engineer's called Lachchi to meet him. Lachchi? Yes, Roopa. My dear. There's another telegram. He says, I am stuck with some important work and can't come. And, tell Lachcho not to leave until I don't come. Goodbye. If you leave he'll get angry. I actually came here to say... that I cannot see Roopa crying any more. Now that you're here, then do meet him. Lachcho. What are you staring at? I'm right behind you, like your shadow. Leave me. - Leave me. - I'll make you the heroine. Leave me. - Scoundrel - Lachcho. Lachcho. Roopa! Bhola. Bhola. Move aside. Get lost. - Where is he? - He's... How dare you? You betray your own benefactor. - Aren't you ashamed? - Good Nanhi... You are a good Nanhi. You misunderstand her. You can speak. Yes. 16 years ago, I lost my voice. Nanhi, I can speak today. Lachcho had come here to say... that she cannot bear to see your tears. Inspector, the necklace you're looking for is with Ratan. - Where's Ratan? - In Mumbai. I know where he lives. Remember, he's instigated my troupe against me. If they accuse me of anything, don't believe it. - Come with me. Come. - I'll come along. - Is this the place, professor? - Yes, this is it. Look, there's she's going up. And yes, look there. Grandpa and the Diwan's sitting in the car. They're trying to trap me. But, I want you to handcuff Ratan. Keep watching, what happens next. He'll be handcuffed... but he'll also have to rot in jail. Come. Sit. Please sit. - Shall I call my mom? - Mom? No. - Are you her daughter? - Yes. My name's Sulekha. - Where's Ratan? - He's gone to the office. I'll be right back. Now I know what stopped him from coming to me. Mother asked you to sit. No, I cannot wait any longer. I am heart broken. Let me go. You don't know, Sulekha. My heart's broken. - Sulekha. - Coming, mother. Roopa. What are you doing here? I was about to write to you. I received all your letters. With the same excuse, same story. What are you saying, Roopa? Why did you deceive me? You could've said that you can't marry me. Why did you play with my feelings? Why did you say I'll go talk to grandpa tomorrow? But, that tomorrow never came. What are you saying Roopa? - I... - Your love was fake. It was deceit. Roopa. What are you saying? I think you're misunderstood. I saw everything myself. If I wasn't concerned about Sulekha, I would've shown you. But I cannot hurt that little girl. I cannot tell her that you are such a deceiver... that you can ruin someone's life. You... you... Sulekha, don't get me wrong. He didn't deceive anyone. He's very nice. He's very nice, Sulekha. Listen, Roopa. Take your safekeeping. Mine? I've already lost that. I will try to forget you. And, I'll try not to dream about you. I've your necklace. I didn't come here for the necklace. That's stolen. That's not my necklace, it was stolen. - Stolen? - Honestly. This necklace was stolen. - Stolen? - Yes. Did you hear, lnspector? That necklace was stolen. It is with the engineer. Okay, I'll take your leave now. Goodbye. Professor, wait. Yes, here's the necklace. Inspector, there's your culprit. You deal with him. I am going. Where are you going? We need you, professor. Govind. Arrest the engineer. You are under arrest. No, inspector. The engineer is not a thief. He didn't steal the necklace. - The professor is the thief. - Roopa! I am telling the truth. He's the thief. - That's a lie. - It's true. It's a lie. Yes, it's a lie. Sheila. That necklace belongs to me, inspector. It belongs to me. And, he took it. And, I reported the theft to find him. He wasted all our wealth and jewelry... in gambling and his drama company. Sheila. Let him go, inspector. I cannot see him getting arrested. I cannot leave him on your request. He's committed a theft and now he's a culprit. Theft. What theft? Stole what? The necklace belongs to him. He's my husband. Sheila. Ratan brother. He's the one I married against your will. And, the one you refused to accept. And then, we never met. Professor, she could've sent you behind bars. But, her honor stops her from doing that. And, because of this woman, I'll have to let you go. Sheila. I am embarrassed. I cannot hold the burden of my crimes any longer. I tormented you. But, now I have realized. A woman has the strength to tackle the biggest problems... and bring happiness to her family. I promise... I will try to be a honest man. Mom. Yes. Our daughter. Sulekha, My daughter. - My child. - Professor... How old are you? - Seven years old. - Seven years? My child's seven years old. I'll make you the queen of my theater... Forget the theater. I will make you the queen of the city. Listen. I misunderstood you. - Sister... - My name's Roopa. - Brother. - Sheila, she's Roopa. I used to talk about her every day. You. So you're Roopa. He used to tell me about you everyday. Brother used to say Let me go, Roopa must be waiting. But I couldn't let brother go. My brother couldn't reach you only because of me. Now he is yours, Roopa, and you are his. Now, you're my sister-in-law. Loving sister-in-law. Smile now. Are you still angry? Bhola. Grandpa. She's my Nanhi. Now, she's found her Ratan as well. Dear, ask your mother to forgive me. Tell your father never to leave us again. Sulekha, tell your mother I will never leave her again. I've finally found light in this dark life. I will never leave her again. - Promise. - I promise in Sulekha's presence. Lachcho! Hello. Hello. You must have understood. That is Lachcho... Your Lachcho's selling sweetmeats at the confectioner's shop. Get it. Don't trouble me again. Go on. Get going. Forgive me, I forgot to thank you. - Thank you. - You're too adamant. - Get going. - Okay. - Yes. - What? Yes, I... Yes, I abused you a lot. - You are angry. - Angry? I mean to say, are you angry? Not at all. - Then? - Not at all. - So... Engineer. Congratulations. When are you two getting married? Don't forget to invite me. - Yes. - Of course. The inspector's asking something. - Yes. - What yes? Say something. - I am ready. - Today? - Now. - Now? - Right now. - Right now. Get lost. We'll sing the song of love. We'll sing... We'll sing the song of love. Our love will keep growing. We'll never separate. We've sworn on love.
