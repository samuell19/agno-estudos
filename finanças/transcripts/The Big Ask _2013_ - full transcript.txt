And I know that it was a trek to come out here. And I know that, you know, it was last minute. But, uh... [SIGHS] There is a reason I asked you all to come. And, uh... I have decided that what I really want is, uh... To have sex with everyone here. [LAUGHS] Oh, man.[LAUGHS] [ALL LAUGHING] OWEN: Oh, God. DAVE: Oh, my God, dude.[ZOE LAUGHS] That's what I really want.

So, is this something that you're considering? [SIGHS] My feeling has been that if Iignore it long enough, it will go away. That's kind of my basic strategy. Okay. Um... Few questions.[CHUCKLES] What does his therapist have to say about all this? Oh, did I not tell you? He stopped going. The dude like, really needs tobe in therapy. You should... You should try to tell him that, 'cause he doesn't want to hear it. Okay. Wow! We got some work to do, huh? You realize that what... What position this puts us all in. It's not, it's really not cool, man.Uh... I totally understand that and I also... I also don't care. [CLEARS THROAT] Oh, that's good.I get it. What? No, I get it. I mean, think about it,you know... The worst thing in the world happens to you and you want to turn it into something positive. I mean, his mom died offucking horrible cancer. And now he wants to use that opportunity to sleep with his friends' girlfriends. Your girlfriend, man. He's talkingabout your girlfriend. I get that. And you're just cool with that? Absolutely not. All right, are we going to play pool or what? Yeah, I think we should have a game of cut-throat. Okay.[BALLS CLICK] You know, you guys just play,I'm gonna play winner. Rack 'em, bitch. Hey. Hey. What? I just feel so embarrassed, you know? Why are you embarrassed? You shouldn't be embarrassed. It's like... [HUFFS] Just... The fact that he dragged all you guys into it and... [SIGHS]If you want to just leave... No, no, no.I get it and... No. We're here for you, too. You know?Thank you. Friend. Thanks.Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks. I scratched out. [SIGHS] All right.[HANNAH CHUCKLES] I'm going to bed.Good night. [BALLS CLICKING] I mean, I'd be pretty pissed off, too, if the roles were reversed. Yeah? And what would you sayin that situation? [STUTTERS] Uh, I would say, "Andrew, "why don't you try to put yourselfin Owen's shoes, "who is on the very edge of a nervous breakdown." Dude, we're all on the very edgeof a nervous breakdown. It's called life! You know what I think? I think that you're just trying to get sex. And you think that if you actfucked up enough, then no one will have the balls to call you outon what you're doing. I don't want you to punch me in the face, 'cause that's my moneymaker. [CHUCKLES] Oh, boy. Oh, God, Zoe.[KISSES] Oh. I'm so glad you agreed to do this. [GASPING AND KISSING] Oh, my God. You're so beautiful. [MOANS] Hmm. Oh, my God. You're really helping me with my healing process. [GIGGLES] Ew![MOANS] You taste so good.Stop. It'll be over in a second. [MOANS AND KISSES] Oh, God! [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] I don't like it here. [SIGHS] I don't suppose you have an answer for meabout that other thing? I really want to go.Like leave? Yes. This is extremely uncomfortable. No, he's not serious. He's not. He gets these ideas in his head, you justhave to ignore him. I think he's really serious. He's like a brother to me. I can't just walk out on him. He wants me to have sex with him! No, he doesn't. I mean, yes, he does. Of course, who wouldn't? But... [GROANS]No, he's not serious. You really want to leave? Yeah. Okay, I'll talk to Owen. This will take me like 20 seconds, okay? He's just a fucking dick.You know. His mom just died. Well, so, you know, if I lose a leg in Iraq, then do I just suddenly have permission to come all over your mom's face? [LAUGHS] What? Well, I'm just saying. It's not... You don'tget a free thing. [LAUGHS] Right. I just think that he's really sick. He's a sick man, he's in a lot of pain.I just... I feel bad for him. Don't you want to sleep with him?No! No. I just...[CHUCKLES] I just want to help him. What? I just want to help him. This is not happening. [STUTTERS] You want to help him? [SIGHS] Have you ever taken a shower with him? You know, I need this conversation to be over... I need to know if you have everseen his dick. You're asking me if he has a nice dick? No, I'm not asking you If he has a nice dick, I want to know how big it is. Oh, my God! I'm not asking you because I care. I'm asking you 'cause I want to knowif it's going to hurt me. I have no idea, okay? Well, but...[STAMMERS] I've, I've... I've never seen him with an erection, okay? So I don't know how big his hard dick is. Uh, like some guys are growers,some guys are not. And I don't know which he is, and I don't want to talk about it and I... My friend Andrew's penis that you're talking about, if it's going to hurt you?[SHUSHES] Why are we even talking about this? [WHISPERS] I'm sorry.[SIGHS] I'm sorry. I was just curious. [CLEARS THROAT] That was a 24-hour joke, right? OWEN: Wait, we're not still talking about that, are we? DAVE: I'm not talking about it. ZOE: Actually, you are. DAVE: No, I'm talking about not talking about it. It's over and... Yeah. Can I say something? Sure, Andrew.Hmm. Okay. So... One hundred years ago, in this very same desert... Holy fucking mother shank!Shut your filthy mouth crater. Right now.What? He was going to try to convince youto sleep with him by reciting some sort of symbolic desert tale. I bet you fucking spent all week memorizing. I bet you googled it like 1000 times. "Desert redemption orgy Joshua tree." "Native American California sandy cock rub." Plus, how to convince women.Hmm. [IMITATES BEEPING SOUND] Guys, he was not. That actually was my plan. OWEN: Unbelievable. WAITRESS: Can I get you anything else? No, I think we're done here. Really? So you're telling me that you couldn't do this for like the next30 or 40, or 50 years? [CHUCKLES] No. Oh, come on. This is like,this has got to be like the greatest vacation you've ever taken, right? It's like, um, maybe the second best vacationyou've ever taken. Mmm. I, uh...[CHUCKLES] Have to think about that. ZOE: I mean, it's up there. Hey, guys. Would you mind if I joined you? Sure, buddy. [CLEARS THROAT] [EXCLAIMS] Ooh! [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] Ooh! This is nice. Zoe, I know we're not super close, but I just wanted to thank you for understanding last night, and notlaughing in my face. Okay. Are you on drugs? Not right now. Yeah, but are you taking a bunch of drugs? No. 'Cause, man, I love you, but you'reacting like a freak. I know. So, please stop. I don't think I'm going to. ANDREW: That one.OWEN: That's too far. Exactly. That's the one. [SHOUTS] Oh, yeah! Oh, you hit the rock? I'm sorry, I didn't see it. Me either. You guys are kidding me? Right? Look, I'm, I'm sure that you hit the rock. I'm just saying that personally,I did not see it. That is also what I am saying. [ROCK THUDS] Suck it, bitches. Oh, did you hit the rock again? I... I wasn't paying attention. I, yeah, I hit it again twice in a row. I was looking right at it. I didn't see it,but maybe I heard it. I feel like I heard it. Funny joke, guys. This is cool. ANDREW: Oh, you know what it was? I stepped on a twig.DAVE: Oh. And it sounded similar.Let's, let's hear it. [SNAPS] ANDREW: It's identical.That's definitely what I heard. DAVE: Listen, can we go catch upwith the ladies and stop? Yeah.OWEN: Mmm-hmm. You just have to admit that I hit the rock. Look, Owen, I'm totally sure thatyou totally hit that rock. Okay, now say it like you mean it. Can we just catch up withour beautiful ladies instead of sitting here having an argument about... ANDREW: Oh, don't.Dude. You just hit me with that rock. Admit it. Don't do it.Admit it. Or what? Or I'm going to throw this rock at you. Couldn't hit me if you tried.You don't think? [GRUNTS] Dude, those are too big. There are no rules in a rock fight. Argh! What are you doing, dude? Maneuvering. [PANTS] OWEN: Andrew, that is too big, dude.Here it comes. Dude, that is too big! [YELLS][GROANS] Ow! Ow![PANTS] We were messing around.You threw a rock at him. It was just a game.Yeah, he did it on purpose. [GASPS]Dude, I did not... You did do it on purpose.[SCOFFS] Okay. Whatever. You're an asshole.You should... You know what? Mmm. Ooh! [CHUCKLES] Ow. Too much, too much. I'm okay. Can you do me a favor? Yes. And then just... [ALL CHEERING] OWEN: The first time I saw him, the sun glinting off his flaxen-haired bodice in the waves, I knew.What? Simon hated everything about his grandfather, but most especially, he hated his shinylittle rat-eyes. Mmm.OWEN: Okay. I grew up in three distinctly different and yet eerily similar religions. Here you go. Hey, you want to come to bed? Not right now. Are you sure?Yeah. Maybe you should come to bed soonand we'll have time to talk. About what? I'm not feeling good.Then take an Advil. No, like... I'm having fun! [GRUNTS] Say something, bitch. Say something, bitch! [GRUNTS] Yeah. Dave wants to leave tomorrow. No. I don't want to leave Andrew alone. I feel like I owe him one. Are you serious right now? Yes. He brought you fucking soup when you hurt your back. That hardly entitles him to slip it in you. He came over every single day. I had a fucking job! You know what? Forget it.[SIGHS] You know what? He's not dying. He doesn't have cancer. It's one step removed. It was his mom. You are your mom. What?You are your mom. It's like having cancer yourself. You realize that if you do this, I will never, ever forgive you. It's not something that you can come back from. You know that his dad left when he was like, 10. He just left. No note. And his mom... You met his mom.Hmm. So you're saying I should fuckhis brains out? No. No! You don't seem that anxious. How do you mean? I don't know. Shouldn't you be more anxious, waiting for meto answer your question? Shouldn't you answer my question already? [CLICKS TONGUE] Toosh.It's touche. It doesn't rhyme with douche. [CHUCKLES] I know it's touche. It's an abbreviation. An abbriev. Hey. I think you need help. I think there's something wrong with you. I think you don't know how todeal with all this pain and it's making you go crazy. I understand. [SIGHS] That's not a response. I understand what you're saying and I will really think about it. You need to go back to therapy. I don't need therapy. I know what I need. To fuck all my friends? I need love. I need a great wave of love. And yes, I need it to be gigantic and astounding, and, and unreal. What if we all do this thing for you and it doesn't change anything? Then at least I tried. [THUDS] [WHISPERS] What was that? Probably like a... ...desert mouse. What? Like a rodent. Maybe you should go see what it is. [SCOFFS] I'll go see what it is. Hello. Hello. Hello! We don't want your kind here. Holy shit!
