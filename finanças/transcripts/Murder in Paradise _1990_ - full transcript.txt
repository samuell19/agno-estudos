Put it on my tab. Another one? What'd you do? -Send them to your friends? -[CHUCKLES] MITCH: He doesn't have any friends. Where the hell is the craftsmanship these days? You know, these are not very durable clocks, Willy. Give me a beer. Starting early, Charlie. Put a shot in it. How's the surf, Polo? Like a bathtub. WILLY: There hasn't been any surf on this beach since typhoon of '52. Oh, yeah. '52, man. Gentlemen, here's to the typhoon of '52. Don't sit here. You fascinate me, Mitch. Move, cop. He's not a cop anymore. He smells like a cop. You know, when you get mad, your neck gets real big and your nostrils swell? You're lucky I got to go to work. Really lucky. [GROWLS] [CHUCKLES] He's gonna hit you one day. He and his bad breath. Give me another shot. WILLY: [LAUGHS] It's too early. Leave him alone, Willy. He's drinking to forget, right, Charlie? Yeah. Is it a woman? Nine of them. Nine women. I don't wanna listen to this again. How can one guy love nine women? I didn't love them, except for one. I loved one. But I got all their faces right here. Pretty faces, huh? Yeah. Pretty faces. I'll never forget them. So you said? How many times have I told you guys this story? Once a month for four months. CHARLIE: Well... WILLY: So tell us something different, Charlie. Tell us about the snow in New York. Tell us about ice skating at the Rockefeller Center. That I forgot, Willy. I forgot. [WAVES SPLASHING] [LAUGHS] CHARLIE: Oh, I got one. I got one. Come here, fish. Come on, fish. Come into--whoa, whoa, whoa. Look out. World's biggest wave. No. No. Oh, my-- [LAUGHS] Oh, my God, man. It's a fish. Come on, fish. Woo. [LAUGHS] Yeah. All right. [LAUGHS] Oh. -PATTY: Nice catch. -Oh. Hi. -I've seen you. -PATTY: Uh, last night at the bar. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Cathy. -Patty. -Oh. Right. Patty. Patty. Patty. At the bar. -Did we have a good time? -[CHUCKLES] Well, you asked me to come by and visit you -at your beach house some time. -And you did. Great. Great. Great. Oh. Why? Oh, I thought you might have some money. No. No money. -Whisky. -PATTY: [CHUCKLES] Mmm. -Sorry. -PATTY: [CHUCKLES] You a working girl, Patty? No. No. Just broke at this particular time. -Oh. -It wasn't just the money. I came because I liked you too. You sang. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Yeah. I always sing. Hey, come on inside. I wanna show you something. Come on. Come on. [CHUCKLES] Sure. CHARLIE: That's Bobby, and Dean, and Danny Greco. Professional, huh? No. Just four New York cops. But we sung at functions, you know. Four-part harmony. -Barbershop quartet? -No, no, no. Popular doo-wopp stuff. You know The Platters? Never mind. Hey, why don't we cook up that fish you caught? Hey, good idea. Good idea. Make a nice lunch. How about dinner? Wanna stay for dinner? Sure. Um, breakfast? Uh, let's wait and see how dinner goes, Charlie. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] CHARLIE: What? Charles Raski? Right. So what? I'm Jim Ishita. This is Richard Aga. Oahu police. Can we come in? Why? It's about a homicide, Mr. Raski. Very important. What the hell does it have to do with me? Are you the Charles Raski who was a homicide detective -from New York? -Of course, I am. How many Raskis you got on this island? You know, I doubt there's a large Polish-American population here. You know what I mean? We tend to burn, not to tan. Now, I'm out of patience here. In New York, you worked on a particular case we're interested in. Look, I'll tell you what. Why don't you two guys go over to that bar over there, and I'll meet you over there in about an hour? 'Cause you see right now, I'm playing Trivial Pursuit, -and I'm sort of winning, and-- -Mr. Raski, perhaps you wanna take a look at this. What the hell is this? You tell us. CHARLIE: When? RICHARD: Two nights ago. Her name's Ansella Suarez. -Do you know her? -No. Charlie, are we busted for something? -What's your name? -None of your business. Doesn't the photo remind you of the mask murder case -in New York? -Of course, it does. -Murder weapon? -Nylon stocking. What's the name of the serial killer -in New York? -Albert Revin. Maybe you guys got the wrong man. CHARLIE: No way. Not a chance. We tied him to every murder. Every one. It was Revin. No questions asked. We had fingerprints, the whole works. ISHITA: And you're sure he's dead? Dead and buried. You kill him? I was there. So I guess what we've got here is a copy cat of some kind. But why, here in Hawaii, just 10 miles from where you live, the only cop tied to the Revin case? I don't know. Will you come downtown and talk to us? Can't help you. You've got Albert Revin. Maybe with your help, we can find-- I can't. Keep it, for your files. I don't have files anymore. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] PATTY: What's in there, Charlie? You stay for a while. Will you stay? -Sure. -Thanks. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: No, no, no. No, no, no. No. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] No. REVIN: Charlie. Charlie Raski. It's me, Charlie. -Remember? -MAN: Come back, Charlie. Kill him. Get him. -MAN: Shoot him, Charlie. -MAN: Do it. Do it now. REVIN: Remember, Charlie? [PANTING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] -WILLY: Aloha. -Hi. Uh, coffee please. Hey, can I buy you a shot with that? Maybe lubricate your engine. Hey, Willy. Now, just keep it in your pants. Ooh. "Coffee, which makes the politician wise." Alexander Pope. [CHUCKLES] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Charles Raski? I've got my drink. Hawaiian coffee is the best in the world. Oh, not the way Willy makes it. Goodbye, officer. It's Mahona. Dr. Mahona. I'm a psychologist from private practice. I'm not in the market. And I also do some work for the police department. Bingo. A patient of mine was killed a few days ago, Ansella Suarez? You have her photograph. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] You know, every now and then you connect with a patient. You really affect one. And this girl was making excellent progress and really changing and reaching out to me, and now she's dead. Yeah, well, a lot of people are dead. Not that way. Nobody should die that way. Revenge? You want revenge, Doc? What do you want? I don't know. My memory's fading. You're trying too hard. You're trying to be some tropical beach bum from some bad movie you saw somewhere. A lot of you Haloes from the mainland, they come over here, you try to play that role, and it's embarrassing, Charlie. Can I call you Charlie? You can call me long distance. DIANE: That's two within ten days. Police department has formed a special task force. We just want you to come in and talk to us. That's all. Just talk to us. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [CHATTER] This is the boss, Capt. John Kilalo. -Sgt. Charles Raski, NYPD. -On leave. -Permanent. -KILALO: Yeah. I heard about it. Thanks for coming in. Everybody--Raski, that's Jimmy Ishita, Det. Aga and Craft. We're just getting started here. We appreciate any bit of help you can give us. We read the reports on your case, but you lived it. [CHATTER] Ansella Suarez, twenty-four, worked as a maid in one of the expensive homes -in Diamond Head. -And it turns out she was making it with her employer, a nightly in the pool house. Uh, it's a real soap opera. It wasn't as trashy as he likes to make it sound. True love. Caused a scandal for a few minutes but it didn't lead anywhere. We checked the boss' story. It's tight. And he had no connection with victim number two. Yeah, nobody does. Just a guy of a Japanese fishing boat, out for a good time on Hotel Street. Nobody in the island knows him. -Same MO? -Yup. Nylon stocking with a rope inside. A rope? Uh-uh. Revin was different. Like most serial killers, he had a target type. Female, usually tall. All his victims were dresses or skirts. Your killer doesn't seem to have a target profile. Also Revin never used a rope, just a nylon stocking, same one every time. He would sexually abuse his victims after. And his masks were more crude, less elaborate than your man. What was Revin's connection to you? He liked teasing us, playing cat-and-mouse -with the police. -CRAFT: Yeah? Why pick you? I gave some interviews to the press for the task force. He attached himself to me. Started calling me up on the phone and... Saying? Just my name at first, and then he found out something personal, something... -You don't have to, Charlie. -I think we should know. The report didn't go into it. Raski, this killer might copy that part of Revin's pattern. He might attach himself to one of us. We should be prepared. -Now, Capt. Kilalo, I don't-- -It's all right. It's all right. Revin knew that my wife and I couldn't have children. We were trying to adopt a child. He, um, used to talk about that. He knew the names of the two men I killed in the line of duty. Not secrets but personal things. He would describe my house. Even the inside. He was crawling inside me, working me like an expert. And every few weeks I was looking at the face of another one of his victims. He was dragging me right down into the horror. He connected it all to me. With messages for me. Then he called up and he described my wife, Claire. He said he was gonna kill her. That's when I should have quit, left the case, grabbed my wife, left town for a while. But I didn't. We put guards on the house, on Claire, day and night. But he got by my people and he-- she was victim number seven. I see you didn't put her photo up. Thanks. He killed two more people after Claire before we got him. By that time, I was so emptied out, I almost let him kill me. How did you get him? You scouted the murder scenes for witnesses? Yeah. It turned up nothing. You have to go back and do it again and again, and never stop. Never! Somebody saw something. In New York, we finally connected a van, a dark van, to two of the murders. It took us months and months and even more months, checking every dark van in the city, every one, looking for a strong left-handed male with brown hair, 'cause that's all we had. But we got him. We got him. 'Cause somebody always sees something. Why don't you work with us, Charlie? CRAFT: Uh, Captain, -uh, I don't think-- -DIANE: Well, maybe -Mr. Raski could excuse us for-- -CHARLIE: For what? Go ahead. What are you gonna say? Captain, we picked up Raski twice in the four months he's been on the island. He's involved in a fray, I know, in the Pair A' Dice bar, charges dropped. Criminal property damage, that was the same place, and that was overnight in the tank. Uh, there's a $200 fine. And, um, Captain. I never had a problem on the job. I stood up for 12 years without a problem. DIANE: The Revin case was too traumatic for Mr. Raski. -He could be at risk. -At risk? -Emotionally. -[SCOFFS] Now, this is the Honolulu Gazette, April 4th. "He crawled inside of me. Revin was driving me. I almost offered myself. "This is your quote, Charlie. A reporter suckered me as soon as I got here. "Off the record," she said. I told her every damn thing. And that's another thing, another thing. In New York, we had too much press coverage. Too much. Revin was able to stay ahead of us. He knew our next moves. You got to limit your press coverage. [WAVES SPLASHING] [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: [MUMBLING] PATTY: It's all too heavy, Charlie. I got to go. Bye, Charlie. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] [GRUNTS] Patty Gresher. I don't know how to spell it. She said she was from San Diego. Another drifter. We used to get a better class of mainlanders. Now, for 99 bucks, anybody can come over here. They end up sleeping on the beach, trying to deal weed, hooking. Uh, David... I want in. I want on your task force. Call New York. I'm still officially on the force. We don't know if we can use you, Charlie. Look. Look, you knew the girl. That makes you a suspect. What the hell are you talking about? A girl gets out of some guy's bed, takes a walk on the beach, gets herself killed. The guy's got no alibi. Now, you're a cop. Who do you suspect? You know it's the mask killer. You know that. I don't know anything, except you're coming apart. Now, maybe you and your girlfriend had a fight and you knew just how to cover up her murder, or maybe you're just whacked out enough to be the mask killer. -You son of a... -DIANE: You're out of line! CRAFT: Oh, the hell I am! If there's a serial killer out there, why hit so close to you? It's too much of a coincidence. It's no damn coincidence. Don't you see that? He's copying that part about it too. The part about me. Playing cat-and-mouse with me, with Charlie Raski. He's brought this case to me now, and I'm in it! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I want in. I want a badge, NYPD, attached to your task force. Charlie. No more crap. We know everything. For instance, we know you were a lieutenant once. So what? So I quit. I didn't want the responsibility. So it's all bull. You're an alcoholic. You've been sliding downhill with a bottle in your hand for five years now. You are coming apart and it showed. That's why Revin went after you, isn't it? He saw the weakness and he went for it, right? [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Before coming to Hawaii, Charlie, where were you? Connecticut? The Wallen Clinic? A mental hospital. I checked myself in, I checked myself out. It was a rest. I'm all right now, and I can work. Use me out there. [CLATTERING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: What's my bar bill, Willy? WILLY: Um, 70 bucks. Plus, uh... 32 for the clocks. Are you leaving? No, Willy. I just got here. WILLY: Hey, Charlie! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Charlie, I came to tell you, you're on the task force. Good. You spoke for me? No. No. I think it's a bad idea. [CHUCKLES] So you're my watchdog, huh? So let's get started. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] [WHISTLES] Hey, buddy. Oh. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Little mess here. Sorry about that. Sorry. Hey, you ever seen any of these people before? Never seen them. You police? Yeah, me police. Could you look at the photos please? Never saw them. You hear me that time? You didn't even look at 'em! He didn't even look at the photos! I'm very upset. Come on, Charlie. Let's go, all right? There are other bars around. Let's go check them out. No. No, this is gonna be fun. Trust me. [GLASS SHATTERS] Honolulu Police! Get up! Get up now! Get up! Form a line! Get up, get up, punk! Come on, get up, get up, stand up, get up, come on, come on, baby. Stop drinking, get up, stand up. Get up, toots. Yeah, Navy, get over there, get your girlfriend up too, get up, get up now. Hey, what are you saying something about me? Get over there, I read lips. Stop drinking get over there. What, what, what? Your mother know you're in here? Get over there, get over there. Now. Oh, what are you laughing and smiling? You're making a face at me. I could arrest you with that face, get over there. Okay, boys and girls, Charlie Raski's here. This is the game. Everybody looks at these photos, okay? Take a picture, pass them down. Take this picture, pass them down. If you've seen any of these people, I want you to--you don't get a picture. I want you to talk to me. All right? Take these photos. Look at them, look at the photo. Okay? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You got weapons here? You got whores here? You got people making very ugly faces here and I'm gonna close you down unless I get some cooperation. You post these, you talk to people and you call me. You hear me that time? Good. Thank you very much. This has been the Charlie Raski Show. We'll see you later, bye-bye, have a drink for me on the house. Bye. MAN: Hey. DIANE: What do you mean? CHARLIE: I don't know it just doesn't feel right. It's clean, it's quick, there's no passion, none of Riven's sexual violence. It's, like, Kilalo says, there's a piece missing, we're just not seeing it. Maybe you're the missing piece. Now he pulled you into the case, he got your girlfriend, so maybe he's watching you. I mean maybe we should be watching you. You are, aren't you? Now victim number two. The sailor's got me going in circle, it doesn't fit and there is one other wrinkle in the book that doesn't fit with anything else either. Sammy Yung was in town -just for that day. -CHARLIE: Who's he? CRAFT: He's one of the big Kahunas from Hong Kong, he's the Mafia there and he calls them the Triads. Yeah. But they're a lot older than Mafias, I mean--and he's really high up in Triads. But why does he come into town for one day and then gone? CHARLIE: Triads, we tail him? Yeah. He shopped, he had a meeting with his lawyers. Real estate it's 7197 Corporation, you know, they're based out of New York. Never heard of them. Oh, I have. They bought up a lot of Nahele Lani, they were in the papers. CHARLIE: There's that Nahehe, whatever again, what's so special? It's Nahele Lani, it's one of the most beautiful and wild places on the island, Charlie. It means heavenly wilderness in our legends. It's Lewa. What the hell is Lewa? Paradise. CRAFT: I just think that we should put a team on Charlie's house. What the hell for, you keep circling me Craft? I got my theories about this guy, do you wanna hear them? Sure--no, sure I do, sorry Craft. I wanna hear everything about this case and Hawaiian Police work in general that you know. I got 30 seconds, I'm not doing anything, so shoot. Let's get out of here Jimmy. This man gets real mean when he's on a wagon. Forget the coffee, let's get out of here, hit the streets. I'm going home Charlie. What? What are you--what are you on Hawaiian time or what? Yeah, what do you know about it? About what? About Hawaii? You've been here, what, four months. You don't try to fit in, you don't try to understand the people, you don't try to learn the ways, you don't even try to pronounce the words. You could be anywhere. But you are nowhere. I guess maybe you're right. Hey. Charlie, I'm sorry. Now listen, it's been a long night and we're all very tired. I'm sorry. I feel better, thanks Doc. I'm gonna go to work now. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] CRAFT: Take a look. I see. Take a close look. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] ISHITA: Names Wineha. He's a Paniolo, a cowboy in a big ranch in Nahele Lani. DIANE: Nahele Lani again. CRAFT: His wallet's not missing, same M.O., stocking around his neck as you can see? CHARLIE: Why Nahele Lani, like the first killing. Ansella Suarez, her boss was a trustee up in one of the biggest states up there. Nahele Lani. -So? -So he loses his job, the land gets sold and now this guy, he's got a connection in Nahele Lani, coincidence? DIANE: What else Charlie? I don't know. I'm just telling you it doesn't feel right to me. I mean what if this is about something, what if this is not about a serial killer? And what if that's the missing piece? What do you mean, Charlie? What missing piece? I don't know, Nahele Lani, the land, I don't know. Man, you want it to be about something look at his face. It's got your name on it Raski. Your name. -What are you saying? -CRAFT: I'm saying the man died about 4:00 this morning, -where were you? -You get off of it, Craft. Get off of it. He's losing it. Tell him. Look Charlie, the Japanese fisherman has nothing to do with the land. Or Patty either. Tell him Mahona or I will. Tell me what? It could be a lot of things Charlie. Some people are even saying it could be you. You're on the suspect list buddy and not the one we released to the press. Not yet. But we're watching you Raski, now you stay in the light and walk real straight. You understand? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. Oh. No. -RIVEN: Charlie. -No. No. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] Riven! [HORN BEEPING] -[KNOCKS ON DOOR] -Charlie? [KNOCKS ON DOOR] ISHITA: Come on Charlie, we're gonna be late. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] ISHITA: Hey Charlie. Charlie? The shower's on. [SHOWER GUSHING] ISHITA: Hey Charlie. Charlie, come on wake up. DIANE: Charlie no. [PANTING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] He's inside me again. Oh, I'm scared. I'm scared. You people are putting up with a lot. I don't know what to say. Why don't you try a thank you. Mahalo. Komo Mai. Murder number one, your friend the maid is killed. The love affair comes out in the open and the guy loses his trusteeship over the land at Nahele Lani. Now, we know that that very same land was sold to the 7197 Corporation. It's like dominoes. That's a stretch, Charlie. CHARLIE: Keep listening. Murders two and three. They had nothing to do with Nahele Lani. Right. They were decoys. Decoys. Think about it. Two random killings to make us think we're chasing a serial killer. Murder number four, back on track. The cowboy, he managed the ranch at Nahele Lani. Now, we know the ranch wasn't doing very well, but I found out this morning that he was being paid in shares and he was approached to sell those shares. Yeah. But a lot of people are buying land here, it's like gold now. Listen. He wouldn't sell the shares, right? But now his family is thinking of selling and guess who the high bidder is? I checked. It's 7197 Corporation. Dominoes. All right. Dominoes. Who's playing dominoes? It's a rich man's game. It's the land, Mahona. There's only so much land on this island. So, where are we going? To Nahele Lani, to see the land barons. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, how you doing? I'll have eggs Benedict. Talk to her. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Wagner Thorne? I'm Charles Raski this is Diane Mahona, And your business just couldn't wait. I know. You're collecting for the, uh, police charities, right? And whoever collects the most money wins a trip to Detroit or somewhere. Oh, I'd be in a hurry too. We're investigating the mask murders. -And? -And I think this case may have something to do with this area, this land, the Nahele Lani Peninsula. These murders? Here? Does your chief know you're visiting today? Have you been approached by the 7197 Corporation to buy your land? By them and others. Is that any business of yours? And are you considering selling? Oh, I'm considering throwing you out. Mr. Thorne, we're just trying to follow every possible lead. Murders on Hotel Street, skid row. And you're dragging them onto my lawn. I hope you wiped your feet. WOMAN: Just look who's being killed. What could those people have to do with Nahele Lani? It's ridiculous. Some of those killings could be decoys. I don't believe you were invited to our little party. Did anyone invite them? Well, they certainly aren't dressed for it, are they? Well then I think the best idea is to throw them out. Agreed? Listen, Slick. You could ask me to leave, but you couldn't throw me out in a million years. And if I could get some cooperation here maybe some people wouldn't have to die. Oh, and you could lose some weight. DIANE: I learned something about you Charlie. I learned that you are not the prejudiced cop I thought you were. No, you're just as stupid when it comes to pushing around rich Caucasians. Do you have any idea what the chief is going to say to Kilalo or what Kilalo is gonna say to us? CHARLIE: I'll worry about that later. DIANE: So sure you're right, everyone else is wrong. You have a typical haole attitude. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING] -Mrs. Danton? -Wait. It's beautiful. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Police. EMMA: So, how can I be of help, Officer Raski? CHARLIE: Sergeant Raski. Well, we're with the task force -that's looking into-- -I know. You're the police officer who likes to throw his weight around. Who likes to treat everyone like a pusher, or a pimp, or even a hooker. DIANE: We have a few question Mrs. Danton. Am I a suspect? You could be a victim. Of a killer who roams downtown alleys? How is that possible? I think it has to do with this land. Thank you, Jackie. From teacher to house boy, he's very serviceable. Teacher? Oh no, Mr. Raski, I'm the teacher. Now, what were you telling me about my land? CHARLIE: Have you had any offers? We've all had offers in this peninsula but I'm not selling. This land... Belongs to my late husband's family. I keep it for his memory also because it's beautiful. I happen to have the most exquisite spot on this earth. CHARLIE: I hear it isn't even on earth, I hear it's paradise. Thank you. I'd be happy to show it to you sometime. Uh, why don't you ask Ms. Mahona, I'm sure she's heard of it. Oh, I've heard of it, yeah. But, uh, in my lifetime, the best of Nahele Lani has been owned and fenced, and, uh, closed off to the people. In the last hundred years, the only Hawaiians to have seen it have been employees of the Danton Estate. Hmm, well, I'd be glad to show it to you, too. And you can take a picture. CHARLIE: Have you had any offers from the 7197 Corporation? We've all had offers Mr. Raski. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must take a shower. Oh, why don't you do the rest of your business by telephone? You act like I just did my business on your rug, Mrs. Danton. You know, Wagner Thorne said that you have this sort of attitude that makes one want to punch you in the nose. Wagner didn't have the guts. Now, I'm sorry our dirty little business has ruined your playtime here with Jackie, but I need a few answers. She's a tough lady. Why didn't you bring it to the team? Why didn't you bring it to me? All you did was start a fire and it cost me valuable time to put it out. We have ways to approach people like the Thornes -and the Dantons-- -Excuse me, captain. Charlie, there's nothing on the lawyers who operated here for the 7197 Corporation. Their orders come out of New York. What's the name means, 7197? That's their phone number in New York, 212-555-7197. Anything more on the Hong Kong Triads? -Zip. -Thanks. -Where are you going? -Emma Danton. It's all right. She called. Well, is this business or what? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] EMMA: Do you feel the magic here, Charlie? -CHARLIE: Yeah, I do. -EMMA: It's very old magic. Very old. You know, I've tried but we're strangers here, Charlie. CHARLIE: Even you? You own it. Nobody can really own it... nobody, Charlie. Even a rich spoiled woman like me knows that. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] EMMA: Now, this... was sacred long before they built this church. You know, it was built in a foundation of a very ancient temple. It was over a thousand years old. Some people say that about my house on the beach. You're very funny. I'm sorry, I hit you Charlie. Well, I thought that if I bought you up here you might forgive me. "If you forgive people enough, you belong to them." -James Hilton. -Hmm... very good, Charlie, you've read English novelists. No, my bartender does. Oh, that's very funny. Well, believe it or not I can be funny sometimes. Tell me something, Charlie. Is it wrong that only a few people can see all of this? And doesn't make it more of a treasure? Well, everybody wants to see paradise. EMMA: It's more than paradise, Charlie. Eternity, Charlie. That's what they call it. The land of Po. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] The regions of the spirits. The good ones as well as the evil ones. You could join them. All you have to do is jump. Hey. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Emma. [LAUGHS] Whoa. -Hey. Hey, Emma. -[LAUGHS] Oh, look what you've done to my blouse, Charlie. That will be $250 you owe me. Bill me. [LAUGHS] That's another $250. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] EMMA: Are you leaving, Charlie? Aren't you? It's gonna be dark pretty soon. Are you afraid of the dark? Sometimes. Stay. I can't, Emma. Hey, look what you've done here. Look at this. You owe me a fortune, Charlie. I got to go. Charlie. You are not leaving me here. How am I supposed to get home? -You are home. -[LAUGHS] Hey, Charlie Raski. You're not leaving me here. And after I've showed you where the world ends? [LAUGHS] [TELEPHONE RINGING] CHARLIE: Hello. -Hello? -MAN [OVER PHONE]: Charlie. It's me. It's me, Charlie. Remember? Remember? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [WAVES CRASHING] Detective Medina, please. Oh. Who's this? Oliver? Yeah, yeah, it's Raski. [LAUGHS] Hell no, I'm not to back yet. Are you kidding? I got flowers around my neck and no tan lines, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, what do you mean? Of course I still talk the same. All right. All right, okay. I--I'm sounding a little bit like I'm less from New York. I know. Some people have been teasing me about that. Uh, well, listen, um, is, uh, Danny Greco there? I mean, who's keeping New York safe, you know what I mean? Yeah. Danny. Oh. [LAUGHS] Ah, same to you, you gutter bag. How's Emily? Good. Give her a hug for me, will you? Oh, I'm doing so-so, Danny. Hanging in there, you know. You heard? Yeah, yeah. Four murders so far. And listen, I got a question... the tapes on the Albert Revin case, you know, the ones of his phone conversations, you know where they are? Yeah--no, wait, I--yeah, I know, I--but are you sure they're all there? Would you? Would you, buddy? Thanks. Would you check? Thanks man, thanks. Yeah. [SIGHS] Yeah. Listen, um... listen, Danny... we nailed Revin, didn't we? I mean, you put three in him and Hank blew his whole clip, and the man was dead on the scene, am I right? I mean, we buried him, he's gone. Sure. Uh, no, I know. Sure. I know. The phone calls have started again. No, no, no. I can't, I can't back down now. Home? I don't know where home is anymore, Danny. I can't, I got to stay with it. I... Listen, uh, Danny, I got to hang up the telephone now, all right? I'll be talking to you. Thanks. Thanks, Danny. Bye. DIANE: Charlie, where have you been? I have been calling you all day. You can't just disappear like that. You want some pineapple juice, Mahona? I was right. You shouldn't be on this case. -I am this case. -Meaning what? The killer is calling me now. -The police can tap the line. -Wait a minute. -Wait a minute. Wait. You know, maybe I just imagined it. I don't know-- Imagined what, Charlie? What? Maybe I don't want some. Maybe I don't want anybody hearing some psycho open me up on the telephone. What do you see out there, Charlie? Devils, Mahona... and ghosts. Your wife? I don't think about that. DIANE: Maybe you should. They say you found her body. CHARLIE: I can't remember. Some things are blank. They're supposed to be. DIANE: Charlie, let the police tap your line. It's for your sake. Word keeps filtering through the department that you're the number one suspect. You're the only pattern in this case, Charlie. It's like you said, you are this case. What do you think? DIANE: I think you need a shave. [LAUGHS] DIANE: Eight hours sleep and a home-cooked meal. [SCOFFS] Are you inviting me? DIANE: You wanna meet my parents? -[LAUGHS] -DIANE: I live with them. Yeah. My brother and his wife and kids and the dogs. There's always room for one more. You'd be more than welcome. Why would you do this? It's our way. [CHUCKLES] You know. You're my friend and they're my family... you know. We're all on the same island. And maybe you need a new place to hide out and act tough. [CHUCKLES] Oh, I'm not ready for your kind of life yet, Mahona. But it's nice that you asked. It's nice. DIANE: It's Hawaiian. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -CHARLIE: Tell me something. -[GASPS] Oh, my God! Charlie! Tell me about the 7197 Corporation. You scared me to death. -Tell me. -Tell you what? About the 7197 Corporation. They're a company that's been buying land. -Why? -Who are they? How should I know? Ever hear of a man by the name of Sammy Yung? No. CHARLIE: Ever hear about the Hong Kong Triads? No. CHARLIE: Your houseboy, Jackie Lo, he's from Hong Kong. I checked. Did you know that? Do you trust him? Are you staying the whole night, Charlie? Tell me something else. Are you wearing stockings or pantyhose? Would you like to check for yourself, Charlie? [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] I hate stockings. I do, too. And I hate pantyhose. Sometimes nothing is best, don't you think? I can't think. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Mahona! What are you doing? Checking up on me? I got a message you wanted to see. Not from me. I'll jump in the shower, we'll grab some breakfast. Too late, Charlie. Look on the bed. -Don't touch it. -Diane, I... There was no murder weapon found on the last victim. -Do you remember, Charlie? -Diane, it's a plant! The whole thing is a setup! I wasn't even here last night! -I'm calling it in. -Diane, not now! I'm close now. They--they'll hold me if you call it in. Twenty-four hours, then I'll come in. Diane, do you really think that I could have strangled all those people? I don't wanna believe it, Charlie, -but I have to look at it! -At what? The possibility! [PANTING] Do you really think I killed your friend, Ansella? You want your revenge, Doc? No. I just want it to be over, Charlie. It's not personal anymore. Good. Good for you, Doc. It's healthier that way. But for me, it is. It's personal. Thirty minutes, then you call the police. -Fifteen. -DIANE: Charlie. Charlie! [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Be patient. Two more minutes. Are you going to be rushing me all night, Wagner? THORNE: Probably. Emma, I've been knocking on your door for years ever since you've been a widow. Let's face it, Wagner. You've been knocking on my door long before I was a window. [SCOFFS] You noticed. EMMA: Where are you taking me tonight? The club. -All right? -EMMA: Oh, yes. -Then I'll take you. -Oh? Where? To the beach. To your beach. I love the beach at night. Sounds like fun. [EMMA HUMMING] -Ready? -Are you? [CHUCKLES] Thank you for waiting. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: Hand. Eye. Spear. Flame. Damn. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Task force. Ishita. CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: Listen to me, Jimmy. -It's Charlie. -CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: I'm not gonna give you time to trace me, but I know you're gonna try. -That's okay, Jimmy-- -We need a trace! Now! CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: --as long as you listen. Come on, come on, get sick, guys. I don't have all night here. Shoot, Charlie. You told me about the Hong Kong Triads and Sammy Yung. They use symbols, don't they? -Symbols? -CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: Damn it, Jimmy, don't try and stall me. The group that Sammy Yung leads. ISHITA: Society of the Hand. CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: The hand, yeah. What others? ISHITA: Of the Eye. -CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: Flame? -ISHITA: Yes. -CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: Spear? -Arrow, yes. -What have you got, Charlie? -CHARLIE: Now, tell me the date that lease is up in Hong Kong and it reverts back -to Communist China. -It's 1997, July the 1st, -I think. -In--tell me in numbers, month, day, year. 719... 7. The Triads are getting out before then. They're getting out of Hong Kong and they're coming here. They're coming to Hawaii. Did you hear that, Kilalo, or whoever else is on the line? Are you hearing me? The Triads are planning on building an empire in Nahele Lani, and somebody's getting the whole damn peninsula for them. You're gonna have the world's worst criminals -right in your lap. -Keep him on. Will you come in with what you've got? Raski, get your haole in here! Listen to me! There are still two land owners who are alive and in place and they're in danger. Do you understand? Wagner Thorne, Emma Danton. Ten more seconds and we got him. Damn. Woo-hoo! [LAUGHS] -Emma! -EMMA: Woo! Oh, oh... your stocking. What is it, Wagner? WAGNER: You lost your stocking! [LAUGHS] Listen, Wagner, tell me something. -Hmm... -Tell me something, darling. What would you do if you had to choose the last words in your life? What would they be? Tell me. What would they be, darling? I don't understand. That's perfect. That's perfect. Wagner. Oh. [GASPING] I'm sorry, Wagner, but I promised them paradise, all of it. It'll be all right, Wagner. We'll all mourn your death. And we'll all bid on your property, Wagner. [CHUCKLES] But I'm gonna win. [CHUCKLES] I'm gonna win, Wagner. [CHUCKLES] Wagner... [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I'm going to make you beautiful now, Wagner. [WAVES CRASHING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] Mister Thorne's not at home. -Where the hell is he? -Not here. He went to the club. -His car is here. -He-- [WAVES CRASHING] CRAFT: Drop it, Raski! Drop the gun! I said, drop it! Take it easy, Craft, take it easy! [GUNSHOTS] DIANE: No! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Are you Dr. Diane Mahona? I got a message for you. I gotta see some ID. Don't look as good as you, huh. You some one, Doc. Kidding, huh? Yeah. Wait. Hey, sister, I'd like to stay and talk story with you, but I gotta bag now. No, wait... Who gave this to you? Hey, some haole guy. Describe him. Uh, some kind beat-up-looking Caucasian bro, you know, with the no shave, 'bout this high, huh? Did he say anything? Yeah, he say, "Kenny, no say nothin'." -Well, where is he? -He say if she say where is he, you say he's in paradise, huh? Mahalo. Hey, who are you? How'd you get in here? CHARLIE: Willy? They're out there. They're watching your house. I know they are. Hey, you got some food? Yeah, you must be hungry. Give me a drink, too. A drink? You sure? You sleep at all? Man, you look rotten. Stay in the back, catch a few hours. Huh? Maybe by then, they catch that guy. Those guys couldn't catch a dog on a leash. I gotta go find Emma Danton before the killer does. I'm going back to paradise, Willy. Paradise is where I am. Yeah, Voltaire, huh? [CHUCKLES] Something was stuffed in the mailbox here. It's for you. I have a feeling about the doctor. She's a good woman. She is. But she's up there in the dark near a cliff where people used to leap off. The land of "Po", heaven or hell. You ever hear about it, Willy? Yeah. This is a trap, Willy. Don't go there, Charlie. I gotta go. Hey, listen, can I borrow your car? Thanks, man. Drink, Charlie. -No, I'm [INDISTINCT] -It's on the house. Hey, for me. [SPITS] Jasmine tea. Against the evil spirit. Luck, Charlie. Here, Charlie. Thanks, big man. Thanks for the keys. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: Emma. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] DIANE: Charlie?
