I never thought I'd become the chief minister of this state. Because I never wanted to become famous via politics. Neither has my family had anything to do with politics. Today, on one hand, I am glad that by being a chief minister, I can serve you all. And on the other, I am also scared that I may not live up to your expectations. To live up to your expectations I need your support. I am glad that our deputy chief minister, Mr. Krishna Kant is amongst us whose political experience would help us. I don't promise that I'd put an end to all these problems soon. Because it'd take some time to mend these conditions. Neither do I promise 100 percent employment nor the end to poverty. But yes, I promise to eradicate criminals from this state. This is my promise. Come! What are you blabbering? Sir, I am not Salim. You are. - I am Riyaz. Come. I'll teach you a lesson. Not a word more! Will you keep quiet or should I.. Sir, he is the one. No, sir! I am innocent. You bother girls. Imprison him! - Come! Sir, the car is here to take John to the court. Where are his clothes? - Here they are, sir. You yourself are responsible for this condition of yours. If you don't want to get into all this you will give the statement which I have asked you to. Deva smuggles drugs and gold. And he used you for all this. You will have to say this. Did you understand? Wear this! I will give the statement, sir. But bring me here after the hearing. I won't go out, sir. Keep me here until Deva is caught. Once you give the statement Deva will be behind the bars. Come on. Move back. Excuse me, sir. We want to know about the witness whom you are going to present in the court. Has he given the statement to the police that he works for Deva? We can't tell you whom he works for. Is the police supporting Deva too? You'll get to know everything. The truth will be revealed after the court's decision. There's not much time left. The witness must be giving his testament in the court. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Kulkarni didn't reach the court. He didn't? - No, sir. Then where is he? Deva. What is all this? I have been brought here like this. This is not fair, Deva. Don't shout, Inspector. This is my court and in my court, the culprits are not supposed to shout. But what have I done? I have the report of your crimes, Inspector. It's been six years since you got the licence. And in these six years you've mercilessly killed five people in your lockup. Look, Deva. Let me go. - No, Kulkarni. I can't let you go. Although I am the one sitting here the people down there take the decision. Kulkarni. It's yet to be decided if you are a culprit or not. Criminal. - Criminal! - Criminal! Criminal! - Criminal! Criminal! - Criminal! Criminal! - Criminal! - No, Deva! I have not committed any crime. I have not killed anyone. If I remand someone and he.. To know what you do after taking people in remand I had sent John to you. Kulkarni. You killed two of my men. I can spare you for that. But the three innocent men you killed.. They had never committed any crime. Their families have to face poverty and hunger because you killed them. One of them was the only support to his parents. And the man whom you shot had 12 members in his family, and he was the sole breadwinner. And Ansari's wife is in her first trimester. And you did all this to get another star on your uniform. No, Deva! No, Deva! You can't kill me. You know, my department.. - I am doing this for them. The government had given you this revolver to end evil. You've just committed crimes. - No, Deva! For the first time, this revolver will be used for a noble deed. Deva.. Deva.. Listen, Deva. Deva.. Listen to me, Deva. - What do you want to say? Listen to me, Akash. I don't regret leaving the job. I used to get so embarrassed. My brother is an officer in a big company. And I work in a mill? Is this why I studied? Is this what I worked so hard for? Deva, I understand that you don't deserve this work. But everyone needs to do something to earn and live their lives. No, Akash. I can't do this. I can't work at the place where I don't like the people. I can't have a life in a job like that. Look at this. This is what one gets with a salary of Rs. 1300.. - Deva! Why did you throw away your shoes, Deva? Deva, look, you'll get hurt.. - To heck with you.. Deva! Listen to me, Deva. Deva. Deva. Why didn't you tell me that your shoes were torn? Look, as soon as I get my salary I will buy you a new pair of shoes. Wear this. Otherwise, people would say that the brother of a senior supervisor is walking barefoot. He resigned.. He resigned from this company too. I wonder what he wants. Forget it. - What bothered you there? I didn't like that job. I didn't like working there. - Did you hear? He wants a job he likes. After so much of difficulty, I spoke to Surajmal and got him a job there. I convinced him with great difficulty. And people are queuing up for such jobs as well. And he doesn't want to do this. I won't be able to do this job. Did I work so hard for such kind of a job? What's the use of having the degree? What do you want? Will you sit idle until you get a good job? Enough! Let him eat. - Shut up! He keeps changing his job. Sometimes he doesn't like the work and sometimes, he doesn't like the place. There's a limit to everything. Deva.. - Did you see his attitude? He just wants to do what he wants and he doesn't want anyone to stop him. What's the matter? Why are you bursting crackers? Hey, don't you know? India lost the match! I won Rs. 5000. You're celebrating the loss of the nation in which you are living in? Aren't you ashamed? - There you go. We've another Mahatma Gandhi's follower. Hey, get lost! You will hurt yourself if this bursts. Come on. Go away. - Brother, let's go. Hey, go.. Akash, take her and go home. Come on. Let's go. So, you'll hurt my brother? Dad, they were at fault. First, they hit me and then.. - Then, he displayed his hooliganism. He started hitting them. I wonder what difference does the two of them have. I did beat them. Had they not run away, I would've skinned them alive. Deva, is this how you talk to your father? Let me talk, Mom. If someone speaks ill of my brother and hits him am I supposed to keep mum? Who do you think you are? You can hit anyone you'd want to? And we'll be in trouble if you do all this. I don't want to trouble you, Dad. But neither can I live like a coward. I can't let evil prevail. I repeat, I didn't do anything wrong. I did the right thing. You get annoyed with everything he does. No one can be submissive at this age. What? What do you mean? Was I never of his age? Was he not? The new generation can't just act senseless. Serve the food. Deva. I was scared by the way they held me. Really, Akash? There were so many of them and I had Guddi with me. Such people are all talks. They don't have any courage. If you hit them, they run away. Why are you laughing? He called you a follower of Mahatma Gandhi. Yes.. Gandhi! Do you know how great a man he was? Today's news. Dad went to his room. Have your food. Come on.. - Yes, keep it here. By the way, Brother the entire society is talking about you. The way you hit them.. Wonderful! Now everybody knows that my brother is great. Enough! If dad listens you praising him then.. What? She'll be scolded and she'll sulk. Then, I will take dinner to her room. Do you hear that? I don't like the way you get annoyed with Deva. I'm not asking you to give him too much independence but.. Do you think I don't love him? I serve the plate which your daughter takes to him. What? - Yes. Loving him doesn't mean I'll not notice his mistakes. Gayatri, one wrong step makes a man repent his entire life. Anyway, I am scared of his anger. There you go. It's time for your stubborn son to go out. "Kamo!" "She took my heart away!" "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Go, my friends, find her." "Go, my friends." "Go, my friends, find her." "Go, my friends, find her." "Go, my friends" "find her." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Kamo, show yourself!" "Kamo, show us your moves!" "I dreamt of her last night." "She was shy and tense." "I dreamt of her last night." "She was shy and tense." "I couldn't sleep after that." "Let's dance.." "Let's get on the floor. Let's dance.." "Let's get on the floor. Let's dance.." "Let's dance.." "Let's dance.." "Let's dance.." "Let's dance.." "I am lost in her eyes." "She has driven me crazy." "I have become her beloved." "I don't care about the world anymore." "I can do anything for her." "She's the reason why I have sleepless nights." "I can do anything for her." "She's the reason why I have sleepless nights." "Took it away.." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "I'll make my dream girl mine." "I will marry her someday." "I wonder where she disappeared to." "She looks stunning." "She has done wonders." "She looks stunning." "She has done wonders." "Took it away.." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Go, my friends, find her." "Go, my friends." "Go, my friends, find her." "Go, my friends, find her." "Go, my friends, find her." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "Where did Kamo take my heart?" "I am looking for her everywhere." "We've to find the one we've lost." "Let's go to Kamo's house" "We've to find the one we've lost." "Let's go to Kamo's house." "We've to find the one we've lost." "Let's go to Kamo's house." "Kamo!" What happened to her? Guddi. Guddi. Hey, why are you crying? Oh, God! Will you say something? Mom, Vilas, he again.. - What did he do? Brother, he stopped me yet again. When I refused him, he held my hand. Deva! Are you insane? Why did you tell him? I wonder what he will do now. But what else could I have done, Mom? Come with me. Brother! - Deva! Brother! - Deva, stop! Stop, dear. Stop! Stop, Deva. - Listen to me, Brother. Listen to me. We will talk to Inder. - I don't want to go there. He'll make Vilas understand. - Brother, please.. Listen to me. - Stop. - Mom.. Brother.. - Stop! - What are you doing? Stop! Brother, please.. - Deva, stop! - Mom! Brother.. - We will talk to him.. Brother, let it be.. - Deva, stop! Come on! Take out the money.. I beg you. Brother.. Listen to me.. 'Brother, he stopped me yet again.' 'When I refused, he held my hand.' Leave him, Deva. He'll die. Mom.. Get some water. What have you done? We've a criminal for a son! We've a criminal for a son! Why were you even born? Why? I'm an unlucky father! I'm an unlucky father! Take him away! I don't want such a son. I really don't. Take him away. This is what I was scared of. But you never used to understand it when I used to argue with you about Deva. You used to think that I was Deva's enemy. I wonder what went wrong with him. Was there anything missing in my upbringing? No. Vilas was my brother. He committed a sin by defiling Guddi. The punishment that Deva gave him was nothing compared to that. Not just Deva, no brother would be able to bear this. His sister.. Sir, what Deva did was the right thing. But what my brother did was not. My brother.. You have loved me like your own son. You never made me feel lonely. 'As per the Indian Penal code, Article 307' 'this court sentences Deva to imprisonment for four years.' Don't worry. I'll console dad. We will appeal to the high court. Don't worry.. Akash, what are you doing? Look, do you want me to cry too? Akash. Please smear the vermillion on the bride's forehead. That was unexpected, you got your son married and didn't even tell us. - The thing is the marriage happened so fast that.. My dear.. Deepu.. Deepu.. Wait! Hey, stop! Look, let bygones be bygones. Deva is coming back home after four years. Please be calm, I'll make him understand. Brother! - Guddi! Deva! - Mother! May God bless you. Dear, you will have to change your mindset and your behaviour. Mother, do you still feel that what I did was wrong? - See that? He regrets nothing! Police, court, jail.. He's done with everything. Every relative of ours knows about what he did and that he is in jail. He's defamed our entire family and he's still asking what wrong he has done. - Please, sir.. Let bygones be bygones. We should think about what to do next. Deva needs you. He needs your love. - People learn from their mistakes. Look at him and tell me. Do you see even an ounce of regret? Yes. That's true. I don't regret anything. I truly believe that. And I don't want to comfort you by lying. Deva. - Please don't! No one should make him understand anything. We have learnt our lesson. We have learnt our lesson for having you as our son. Please spare us now. We can't tolerate you anymore. Why are you making a mountain out of a molehill? He will understand. I'll make him understand. Please calm down. If you take such decisions, Deva would get upset.. What did you just say? You know that.. - No, Mom. He's right. If I'm not ready to change myself, it must be my weakness. I don't have any right to make you all worry for this. Dad, I do regret the fact that I've never made you happy. If I get a chance to rectify that I'll be elated. Deva.. - Deva.. Deva.. - Listen. Stop him. Please stop him. - Deva.. Stop! Deva, listen. Deva, listen to me. If you leave the house, I will leave too. Even I'll come with you. No, Akash. This family needs you. And dad needs you. He hopes for big things from you. Never break his trust. Deva.. Deva! Deva.. Deva. Akash! - Look who's with me. Inder. Hey! Won't you hug me? Come here.. Deva! You've become quite fit having a government job. Tell me, will you be my guest in this city or the government's? I got transferred here after all these years. You say nonsense! This is my city! Hey! You got transferred here! - Yes! He's become an ACP. Inder, I'm really happy for you. Look. It took me years to get promoted. But I'm shocked at the pace of your growth. Deva has become an affluent man. Will we be talking here all night long? It's true. You've come at the right time. Everyone would be happy now since you're here. Wait. - Excuse me. Deva. You have earned well enough. But did you find love or not? I mean, a girl.. - Girl? I mean, marriage! - Marriage? - Yes. Look at his condition. I can't even dare to get married. - Is that so? Are you kidding me? Look, I'll find such a girl for you.. What kind of a girl? - What kind? Yes, what kind of a girl? "Black tresses and fair cheeks.." "Black tresses and fair cheeks.." "Don't try to entice me." "My mesmerising gait does wonders." "It strikes all the guys down." "Black tresses and fair cheeks.." "Don't try to entice me." "My words, as sweet as honey.. - Wow!" "My killer eyes.. - Wow!" "Touch me if you can, my lips are as soft as silk. - Wow!" "I'm still unmarried. - Wow!" "I am loved by everyone. - Wow!" "The world yearns for me. - Wow!" "My fragranced kerchief did wonders." "It strikes all the guys down." "Black tresses and fair cheeks.." "Don't try to entice me." "My youthfulness.. - Wow!" "I am a storm.. - Wow!" "My face glows as bright as the sun. - Wow!" "I have loads of fun. - Wow!" "But I'm as sensitive as a petal. - Wow!" "Name one and I'm his lover. - Wow!" "Even my wonders does wonders to people." "It strikes all the guys down." "Black tresses and fair cheeks.." "Don't try to entice me." "My mesmerising gait does wonders." "It strikes all the guys down." "Black tresses and fair cheeks.." "Don't try to entice me." Come on.. - Look! Where are you taking me? Come on.. - No.. Tell us.. - Look.. Come on! - Don't speak.. Come on.. Look, I stick to what I said. I'm working for you guys. And I'm not the only one with the CM. He has many honest people with him, just like him. Who knows when ministers would be thrown out! No one knows that! Hey! All the problems in your politics how many people are there with the CM and what problems you have.. We have nothing to do with them. Our business is facing its downfall. The police has sealed all our factories. You were talking about getting us the licence, right? What happened to that? And stop speaking nonsense, will you? We've had enough. Speak with respect to me, got it? - Hey, Babu! Did you use to talk to us like this before the elections? And you're trying to teach us! You are an idiot. We have already taken Rs. 60 crores from the market for that tender. We've lost that money. Lal Singh, such things are imminent in business. Forget that.. We are not going to gain anything by not trusting Mr. Krishnakant. I'm speaking the truth. I had made all the arrangements for the CM's downfall last month. I had 19 MLAs with me. But no one knew that there'd be something wrong at the centre. Did you read the governor's interview in today's paper? Everyone is fake. I understand, Mr. Krishnakant. I understand everything. We are hitting speed breakers in business, and you, in politics. Do you know? Two of your special friends.. Two of the MLAs, who were really loyal to you.. They are in league with the CM. - You're mistaken. Trust me.. - Mr. Krishnakant, being with you we know a thing or two about politics. Look at that for example. - What are you doing? Let go! What's happening here, sir? What's with all this? Mr. Krishnakant, I'm with you. Trust me. I swear to the Goddess. I'm still with you. Mr. Chandal.. Go and check who's there. They.. Ask her who bribed her to stop my car and who the people were who were shooting. Look, you're misunderstanding me. I.. - Girls like you can do anything for money. You're right. You're absolutely right. Yes, I am a characterless woman who has dolled up for money. Because I am a club dancer. I have to wear such clothes to keep people happy. And I don't think I need to tell you that no girl loves doing this. I didn't intentionally bump into your car. Those people wanted to kill me. When I came out after the show I saw someone being killed. That's why, they were following me. Okay. You don't need to cry. Mani. - Yes. Drop her home. - That's not needed. I can go on my own. I don't need your favour. Mani. - Yes. Find out where she resides and what her problem is. Listen. Can someone drop me? Sure. Let's go. Have some shame. You couldn't catch a girl? - We tried our best, sir.. Shut up! Come on. Leave me. Are you married? I understood. You are not liking anyone. Same is the case with my daughter. I wonder what's going in her mind. Mom! - Yes! What's going on? You started speaking ill of me again? No. Anyway, how is it going? Did you take the medicines on time? Yes. I did. And the doctor also came to check on me. I told him I'm still coughing. What's the use of all the medicines? Did you have 'Pani Puri'? Yes. - What? - No.. I don't eat that. - Mom, you won't ever listen. Didn't the doctor ask you not to eat spicy food? I asked him not to make it spicy. But that fool doesn't listen. He laughs for no reason. He says that he understands everything and still makes mistakes. What have you brought? Apples and bananas. - Oh, no! Oranges? Didn't you get oranges? This is the first time I forgot. It's okay. I'll exchange it with the other patient. We have an understanding. I fed her 'Pani Puri' secretly. Has any doctor refused her to eat spicy food? The way you scold me he too gets scolding from his wife. This is usual here. I enjoy it. Mom, you enjoy here. But last night, I had a hard time. - Why? What happened? Did you have a problem with the new boss? Nothing. Have apples. You didn't tell me anything about your new work. Are you.. - Do you trust me, Mom? Look, do you think I'll do something wrong? No. - Okay. - I trust you. I'll find a nice guy for you and get you married when I recover. And if you like someone, tell me. I did find someone. But I need time. I need to get to know him. I need to know who he is. Sir, he is Deva. He has become famous in the world of crimes. He smuggles gold. Although he is not a member of the underworld and drug mafia. Sir, he is Jindaal. He owns many industries and factories. But his real business is of drugs. And he is also in touch with an international drug mafia. He is Lal Singh. He owns a company named Lal Constructions. He has taken over umpteen number of lands. Even people from the municipality are with him. He has constructed buildings over government's lands. There are a lot of cases against him. He is Khan. He is the most famous don of the underworld. His passion is to kill people for money. There are many cases against him for the murder of many affluent people. He works for Jindaal and Lal Singh. Unfortunately, the police couldn't find any evidence against them. I have complete faith that if the three of them are apprehended there will almost be no crimes in the city. Tell me something. When you know everything about them what is the problem in taking action? There is a problem, sir. And the problem is our law. The court procedures take a lot of time, sir. And all these people bribe the best of the lawyers. The court is not able to reach the conclusion and the case is forgotten. I know what you want to say, Mr. Saxena. But that doesn't mean that the police will sit idle. Definitely not, sir. - The police department should take an action. - But we need rights for that, sir. We need special powers. We should have a magistrate who can give us warrants against them anytime. And we should have special powers to arrest them when we want to and if need be, we can also use third degree on them. That's right. I know whatever you are saying is right. Absolutely right. But what's the guarantee that the police department won't misuse these powers? Sir, the one misusing these powers won't be spared. He should be punished too. I like your suggestion, Mr. Saxena. Thank you, sir. I'll tell you my decision by tomorrow evening. "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday, dear Deepu." Let's go and get something to eat. Akash, this is for you. Akash? This seems to be expensive. You will write history with this pen. Will I have to do something so great with this pen? Then you should keep this and do exactly what you said. The history written by me will be difficult to read. You say such amazing things, Deva. Juice! This is strange. Inder didn't come yet? And the dinner is ready too. Don't make us starve because of him. Inder has taken charge today. He is a policeman. His duty comes first. So how much did Lal pay you to get the slum vacated? Tell me! I never went there, sir. I was in Goa. I very well know people like you. Tell me! Don't touch me, sir. I know the ways of law too. I know the reason behind your confidence. Because you know that your boss, Lal Singh, is there. The one who will bribe the constables and bail you out. But now, the time has changed. Get as far away as possible from Lal. Because now, I'll put an end to people like Lal. What's the matter? He is the one working out and you are sweating. I think you have a good news. Tell us. It is a nice opportunity. Mr. Lal, I think we won't be able to get the land, the one in Kalina. Because legally, Nanabhai Trust had bought the land for building school. They've got the court's stay order. I met their lawyer and told them not to take this case. But he doesn't listen. The trust's lawyer got the stay order from the court and you.. What did you do? Mr. Lal, I tried my best but.. It is a matter of Rs. 100 crores and you're just trying? What is the case? What did you do? We killed a man. You shouldn't have messed with Mr. Lal. Someone, help! Someone, help! Save me. Someone, help! Anyone here? Save me. Anyone here? Save me. You're shouting and that too, in front of her! Take her blindfold off and she'll be the first to run. Anyone here? When no one listens here even when it's full of people who will listen to you now? Well, I will. One needs to become an animal to kill an animal, Dad. Lal. I need to talk to you. Can't you see that there's a meeting going on here? You can continue with that once we're done talking. Deva, look, you.. I am not here to kill you, Lal. Munna or Mani can do that. What do you want from me? Lal Singh, your hooliganism helped you make big buildings and take over lands. You've become so greedy that you don't even want to spare schools and cemeteries! These are the papers of the plot in Kalina. You'll never try to take this land again. Sign these papers and I spare five years of your life. Giving up an ordinary plot for five years of your life, that's a good bargain. Sign this. The lawyer you wanted to kill Ashok Pradhan, is my father. If you make this mistake again I'll skin you alive and make you yearn for your normal life. Your expression says that you love your life. Everyone at home is worried, Deva. I stopped dad from taking this case. There are so many plots which belong to Lal Singh. Nothing can be done in the court. But dad.. - Nothing will happen to him. Forget about Lal Singh. Not even the biggest of the goon can touch him. Deva, I am worried for you as well. You've so many enemies in this city. Look, I know that you can't tolerate evil. But the police also supports the wrong people. Don't worry about me. You don't know about my work. I deal with such kind of people. You tell me, how is your work? I've started a new business of building materials. Got a lot of contracts. We're talking to a few more builders. Akash, I want you to leave all this and start something good. No, Deva. I am happy with this work. I work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and then, back home. And I won't be able to handle anything big, Deva. It's useless talking to you. Munna. Give this file to dad. These are the papers of the plot in Kalina. Hey, Gopi! Where's mom? She's not on the bed. - Your mom? She is gone. - Gone? Where did she go? She went to Apollo Hospital. - Apollo Hospital? What is this, dear? - This is a hospital. Hospital. - Is this how hospitals look like? Affluent people are treated here. It must be expensive. Not much. You just need to deposit Rs. 1 lakh. Rs. 1 lakh? - What happened? Hold me. I am feeling dizzy. - Let's go to your room. Yes. - What? In my room? - Yes. Will I get a separate room? - Yes. Let's go.. It's so huge. Oh, God! It has got a TV as well. Does that work? Yes. You can check. It does work. It is a colour TV. Look.. And what is that machine? Ma'am, that is an air conditioner. What is it? - Air conditioner. It cools the air. Look. You are right. This bed. Is this also for me? Oh, God! Do such beds really exist? I am feeling dizzy again. Okay. We shall leave, ma'am. - Okay. Go. Mom, you're here? - Hey, dear! Come here. Let me pamper you. Come here. Wow! You seem to be working in a big company. And Deva is so good at heart. He looks so innocent. Did you see the colour TV? And there's an air conditioner too. And this bed is so nice. I think Deva is happy with your work. That's why, he.. - Mom, you'll recover here. You'll get a better treatment here. I don't care anymore. Who wants to recover and go away from such a place? I won't go from here. I'll ask the doctor not to treat me. So, you want to enjoy on my boss' earnings? I'll tell him. Deva.. Deva.. Deva.. I've come to meet you. I thought of thanking you in person. So, tell me. What? You thanked me. Do you want to say anything else? No. Nothing. That's all. I.. Look, I don't like when you are upset and scared. You look good when you're angry. Your mother also said that you are short tempered. And that she is also scared of you. What do you mean by that? Is there anyone else who is scared of me? She's mad. She speaks her mind. Mr. Jindaal, why have you called Deva? He keeps troubling us. And we are calling him here? - Mr. Jindaal even I think that Deva can become a threat to us. Relax, friends. Deva is a budding businessman who is still a learner. He is young and passionate. And the most important thing is he wants to be successful very soon. I think we should keep such a man close to us. Apologies for the delay. By the way, I am astonished to get an invitation for this meeting. - Deva. Lately, our business hasn't been flourishing. We have gathered to discuss how to curb this difficulty. After all, it's about our domain. And you are a part of it. Just because we belong to the same domain doesn't mean we will have the same mentality. You don't have to worry about that. It changes with time. I should appreciate the way you are working. That's great of you, Mr. Jindaal. By the way, let me just tell you all that I have just learnt to stand on my own. I haven't really started working. There's a long way to go. You were talking about the problems. - Deva. I mean to say that we shouldn't hold grudges for petty issues. We'll be strong if we are united. If we divide ourselves we will drift apart and harm ourselves. We shouldn't make any such mistake. We should stay together and fight our enemies. And our enemy is the law. You know that our new CM is an honest man. He has taken the responsibility of eradicating crime from our state. And he has shouldered the responsibility on ACP Inder Saxena. We found out about Saxena's past records. This man is not good for people like us. We should kill him before he takes any action. - No, Mr. Jindaal. We can't make the entire police department our enemy by killing Saxena. Everyone knows that no police officer can be honest for a long time. And the day Saxena understands this he'll apply for his transfer. I think we should give him three months' time. If nothing happens after three months you will kill Inder Saxena. How can I promise you this? Death and time has got no relation, Mr. Jindaal. Who knows if you will be alive after three months to see me kill him? Oh, God! Hurry up! How are you, ma'am? - I am good, dear. Had I been in that hospital, my condition would've worsened. I got a new life here. What are you looking at? I am wondering who you are and where you have come from to rid us of the problems. Not even a family does this, dear. What have I done? - You've done everything, dear. You're getting me treated and you gave a job to my daughter. How is she working? Jaya? Don't worry about her. She's doing amazing. In just a few days, she learnt everything. Everybody likes her. - She is a bit immature. Please don't mind her words. She's straight forward as she didn't have a father. Don't worry about her. Just take care of yourself. Follow the doctor's orders and don't eat anything spicy. I'll keep visiting you. - Okay, dear. "Oh, my darling!" "Tell me" "what I should name this relationship of ours." "What I should name this relationship of ours.." "Oh, my darling!" "Name it so that I can" "stay with you forever." "Stay with you forever." "Tell me how much should I love you." "I can do anything for you." "I can give my life for you." "At least, come to me." "I've become crazy for you." "I'm lost for you." "You've taken my sleep away." "Let me come in your arms" "and rest.." "And rest.." "And rest.." "Oh, my darling!" "Tell me" "what I should name this relationship of ours." "what I should name this relationship of ours." "I can leave this world for you." "I can give up everything." "I'll come closer to you." "Come in my arms, my love." "It feels amazing to be with you." "It's wonderful." "The love of ours" "has become intense." "Has become intense." "Has become intense." "Oh, my darling!" "Tell me" "what I should name this relationship of ours." "what I should name this relationship of ours." "Oh, my darling!" "Oh, my darling!" "Oh, my darling!" "Oh, my darling!" "Oh, my darling!" Deva, why are you worried about Guddi's wedding? Do you want to keep her here all her life? I am wondering that we have pampered her so much. We would do anything for her happiness. And now she'll have to stay with new people in a new house. Guddi is not going to a new place, Deva. The boy I chose for her knows her as much as we know her. And if he bothers our sister we both can skin him alive. Who is he? - ACP Inder Saxena. Look, Deva, every other person has taken my interview and they think I deserve her. But if you want.. - Inder! Guddi is my only sister. I can sacrifice anything for her happiness. I need a man with a golden heart who is capable enough. And you are capable enough. You're insane. - I am elated. I am very happy. - Deva. One of our biggest problem is solved. Dad is also happy with this alliance. He can't wait for the time when we both bid our sister farewell. Deva. Deva, I don't feel good saying this in such a situation but there's a problem. - What is it, Inder? Deva's name is on the list of the four goons who are most wanted. I know that. - Then you must also be knowing that all the senior officers will attend my wedding. My position.. Please don't come on my wedding. What are you saying, Inder? Deva won't come on Guddi's wedding? Do you know how much he loves him? - Akash! Inder is right. I don't want any problem in Guddi's wedding because of me. Inder, I won't come. I won't. Make her wear the nuptial chain. Here. Apply the vermilion. Now, stand up. Deva. Will you say something? Let me adore my sister first. I waited for this moment since so long. Brother. - Hey! I'll hit you if you cry. Akash, look how adorable she looks. She looks like a doll. Right? Hey! What happened to you? Deva. Look how the time has changed. Our childhood full of mischiefs and shenanigans. Our fights, making up.. And now, time has separated all of us. They made us drift apart. Guddi. Don't cry, Guddi. Look, you're not going away from us. You will be in this city. And I will not let the ACP get transferred. I've got contacts. Okay, tell me. What gift do you want? Tell me. You've given me such a big gift. You got so many poor girls married today. I've the blessings of their parents. I don't need any other gift. Akash. Take her home. They must be waiting for her. Listen, dear. Take this money and get me 'Bhel'. Ma'am, outside food is not allowed here. This will be between us. Okay, you can keep Rs. 2 and get yourself a cup of tea. Why are you forcing me, ma'am? I'll lose my job. Wow! You'll lose your job if you get me 'Bhel'? What kind of a hospital is this? No one is worried about a patient's craving. Go and save your job. Go away! Deva, Ms. Amina who works in the milk factory has a problem. Look, Deva.. Ma'am! - Deva? You're here, dear? - Yes, ma'am. - Deva.. Yes, ma'am. Look what these people are telling me. They're saying that I poisoned the kids. Can I ever do this, dear? - No, ma'am. No. - I had brought milk packets to rid them of hunger. How can it be poisonous? - Where is the milk? Look, it must be somewhere there. I work in the milk factory near Chincholi Phatak in Malad. I got it from there. Near Chincholi Phatak? - Yes. There's just one factory near Chincholi Phatak. And that's shut, which belongs to Jindaal. This is not milk. This is drugs. Ali! Shankar! - Call them! They will come but to perform your last rites. Come on. Put down the weapons. Put down the weapons. No! Mani, take the children and women out. Yes, Deva. - Come on, dear. Get up.. Hurry up! Get out. Come on, ma'am. Come on, dear. This way. - Hurry up! Careful. Ma'am.. - Come on, ma'am. Go out. Come on. Careful. Hurry up! Are you in your senses, Deva? You're a devil whose intention is to get loads of money even if it takes selling poison. Don't mess with me. Because it would lead to your demise. Human bodies are burnt after their death. If anything happens to those kids you'd be the first one who will be burnt before you die. Hey, mister! Weren't you supposed to come early today? Please look at your watch and see what time it is. I do realise what time it is but.. But you have a lot of work and you can't leave, right? Shobha. Because of Guddi's wedding the shop was shut for five days. All my work is pending. That's why. You'll see, I'll manage everything in a day or two. Okay. Come whenever you want to. But Deepu and I have decided to have dinner together. Shobha, you.. Listen to me. - Bye. You didn't go yet? - Sir, my wife is really ill. I have to leave for the hospital right away. Oh, no! They've called the labour at 7 o'clock. We have to deliver this by tonight. Give me the tempo's key. I'll deliver it on my way back home. No one's here. I think there's someone upstairs. Mr. Jindaal. We can take care of the CM. But we have to do something about Deva too. Look, CM.. - We know everything. Tell us what you are planning for the CM. Tell us. We have had huge losses. It's not Krishnakant's cup of tea to stop the CM. And now, it is not safe for the CM to be alive. I like this attitude of yours, Khan. You come to the point without wasting any time. The CM doesn't want to leave the path of honesty. That's why, he should be killed. We will plan the CM's murder. And Deva will bear the accusation. Pick up the phone, Deva. Hello. Hello. - Hello, Inder? Akash here. Yes, tell me, Akash. How are you? Inder, I had gone to deliver the product. They were saying that they'd murder the CM and blame Deva for it. What? What are you saying? His name was Jindaal. He was saying that he'd frame Deva. Where are you, Akash? I am calling you from Vasantrao Bhagwat Chowk's telephone booth. Akash, stay there. I'll come right away. - Inder, come soon. I am worried. Akash, don't worry. I am coming. Don't worry. I am coming. - Yes. I will stay here. Sir, let us make a call. 'Hello, Aarti. Manish here.' 'Are the kids asleep?' 'They're awake? Pass the phone to them.' 'I'll get ice-cream.' 'Pass the phone to mom. Yes, Aarti?' Akash, I asked you to stay there. Inder, I was waiting for you. If I had stayed there for some more time they would've killed me. - Who? Who would've killed you? Those people, Inder. The ones who were talking about killing Deva. Inder, do something. Otherwise, those people will kill my brother. Do you know which building it is? - But Inder, you're alone. Don't worry. I am with you. I am a police officer. Come with me. Upstairs? - Yes. Stay with me. Here. Here, Inder. - Don't worry. Careful. Here? - This way. There's no one here, Akash. Akash, is there a misunderstanding? No, Inder. They had a meeting here. And Mr. Jindaal was saying that they'd kill the CM and frame Deva for it. We are still here, Mr. Akash. - Inder, he is Jindaal. He is the one. Had we not found this pen cap we wouldn't have known who was eavesdropping. Inder, he.. My brother had a hand too, you know. Your brother had torn it apart. - Inder? What are you saying, Inder? I am proud of your capabilities, Inder Saxena. We will ruin your family. And we'll start from you. We'll send your body to Deva. Deva! Deva! 'Deva!' 'Deva, look, I'll buy you a new pair of shoes' 'as soon as I get the salary. Don't sulk.' 'Gandhi! Do you know how big a man he was?' 'Will I have to do something great with this pen?' 'In that case, you should use it.' Akash.. Akash.. Deva! No.. No, dear. Pull yourself together. Everybody has to face this once in his lifetime. No one can run away from it. Face it. Don't give up, dear. The Almighty will do justice for whatever happened with you. They didn't do the right thing by killing your brother. I am blind but I can still see their destruction. Dear. You will win. You've got the blessings of so many people. Look. But why did he come here? That's what I am thinking, Mani. Why did Akash come here? What do you mean to say? - Mr. Lal. You aren't lucky these days. That's why, I've brought him. He is Sage Badri Narayan Shastri. He is great at his work. And he is a well-learned sage. The famous politicians and actors consult him. Moreover, our well-known producer Gulshan Kumar, who is making a film based on this is written by him. - Oh, God! Stop this nonsense. Hit me with your shoes. Skin me alive but please wear this. What is this? - This is.. Look at this. This is an owl's nail. - An owl's nail? Yes. - The sage venerated this and made it pious. It will act like a shield for you. Wear this. - Take this away! Shut up, Sage! - Okay.. Don't wear it. But put this in your pocket. Take it. - Hey! - No.. It's okay.. That's it. There's nothing to worry now. Everything else has been done. On the main door, I've attached a horse's nail. And I've fixed four nails in the four corners of the office. No ill omen can touch us now. The sage will recite 21,000 mantras. Our enemies can never even come near you. You know why I have come here. Tell me, who killed my brother? Look, Deva. I don't know anything about your brother. I'll hit you until you tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Deva! What are you doing, Deva? Deva.. Deva.. - Leave me, Inder. - Deva. My brother died at his place. At his place! Deva, control yourself. What are you doing? You don't get this, Inder. My brother died at his place. 'According to the enquiry, Lal Singh was not in the city.' He was not in the city. Inder, Akash's death is not an accident. He has been killed. Why did he go to that building that night? What work was going on there? - Deva, if you are right I will not spare Akash's murderer. Do you think I am not upset about Akash's demise? Wasn't I close to him? Look, Deva. The way you want to get to the conclusion is absolutely wrong. Do you know? Lal Singh can file a case against you stating that you tried to kill him. - Inder. My brother has died. For the law, Akash's death is a petty case which will be given a number and the file will be closed. The day I get to know who is behind this.. I will take revenge in my own way. In my own way. Deva. Stop. We found this man. He has also killed Inspector Kulkarni. I know that he knows a lot about Akash's case. We've injected a special serum in him and he will speak the truth for the next 10 minutes. He'll say everything, whom he works for and what work he does. Take him away. Deva. Don't think that we're sitting idle. I'll do everything I can for this case. Hey! Stop him! John! John! John! He committed suicide. He didn't commit suicide. He sacrificed himself for his boss. Now, you must have understood why crime is overpowering the law. Because your department lacks people like John. Until now, you all have done a lot for me. You do everything possible to save me. Now, I want you all.. - What do we have to do? I want you all to look after all the projects which are legal. We will look after it? What do you mean? Do you want to leave us? I can't risk your lives for myself. Deva, you are embarrassing us by saying this. And you're putting a price on our loyalty by giving us all this? Rashit, I meant.. - He is right. You promised us that we would always stand beside each other. How can you let us go now? Deva. Deva, you proved it to us that we were never your family we were just working for you. Mani. I'm feeling dizzy. Enough. Enough of this. Hail the Goddess. Hey, stop! You can't go inside. How will you stop me? Can't you see? This is a parrot. This is not allowed here. Ma'am had asked me to bring this. - Hey, you! - Yes. It's here? My parrot. My parrot is here.. Hey, what's your problem? How will this parrot harm your hospital? I'll lose my job, ma'am. - Hey, why are you worrying? I am here. Blame it on me. I'll take care of it. My parrot. Let's go. My parrot. I've bought a new cage for you. It's good. - And I've given your house for rent. Good job! - What? Did you rent it for a lesser price? No. The one who wants it will take it. Do give me the cash on time. I have to pay the bills. Definitely. - Did you understand? Did you call me? - Here's Rs. 10. Go and get spicy 'Kurmure' for it. - I can't get it. I don't want it for me. I want it for the parrot. Yes. - Okay. - And tell the doctor that I asked you to bring it. Go. I fooled him. Now, we both will have it. Come, Inder. - Sir. Keep it there. Sir, in these two suitcases there're approximately Rs. 15 lakhs in cash and gold biscuits worth Rs. 2 crores which has been smuggled. Sit down. - Thank you, sir. Sir, all of this was found in Dahisar's flat. Has anyone been arrested? Sir, this flat is of Hansmukh Patel. But since the last six months this was rented to two people. They had told the owner and the neighbours that they had a business of clothes. But since the last two days they've latched the house and disappeared. It's obvious, they knew about our operation. Inder, they might be linked to Deva or Jindaal. There's no doubt, sir. You're right. It's Deva. Sir, this time, when I arrest Deva I want you to be present there. Because I am sure that in your presence, no one will dare to take Deva away. - Go ahead, Inder. I'll come wherever and whenever you want me to. Thank you, sir. That place feels so empty without Brother Akash. Everybody is just consoling each other. Deepu's innocent questions are heart-wrenching. Dad keeps consoling everyone but I've seen him cry when he is alone. Everyone used to adore him. I doubt if he has ever hurt anyone. I got this pen beside Akash's corpse. The one who has this cap is the culprit. I will find him. I will find him, Guddi. Why are the lights off? Where are you coming from at this hour? You? You're drinking alcohol? I asked you, where are you coming from at this hour? I.. I went to meet brother. Didn't I ask you not to meet Deva? Didn't I? - Yes, but.. But I met him today after Brother Akash's demise.. Who am I to you? I asked you, who am I to you? Husband. Then you have to follow my orders. You have to do whatever and whenever I ask you to. Deva is a criminal. And I am an officer. A police officer. And it's not good if my wife has a relation with a criminal. Did you understand? - Forgive me. I won't repeat this. Get used to it. Forget Deva. Mani. - Yes. Since how long have you been working with Deva? Around four years. - Okay. He is a nice human. He is good at heart too. His business must be big too. - Yes, his business is good. He must be earning a lakh or two a month, right? - Rs. 2 lakhs? He earns a huge amount of money. - What do you mean? It means, Rs. 1 crore. You mean, Rs. 10 to 12 crores? Will you have 'Sev Puri'? No, ma'am. - I'll order one for you. Ma'am.. No.. - Ward boy.. How is my daughter? - She's pretty. I meant, does Deva like her? - He likes her. A sage had once said that she'll marry a rich guy. Imagine how good they'd look together. They'd be the next Romeo and Juliet. Right? By the way, where is Deva? What is it? - I.. I want to say something to you. - What? I mustered up the courage today to tell you that I have fallen for you. I love you. Deva. Listen to me, Deva. Deva. I liked you on the very first day we met. With time, I started falling for you, Deva. Jaya, you know how my life is. Do you know what being with me is like? I might be killed by the police or the enemies. Anything can happen to me. - I know that, Deva. I'd like to live the rest of my life with you. This is not possible. - It is. If you want, everything is possible. Deva. Just once. Give it a thought. You'll see, your life will change. - Stop talking nonsense. Do you know anything about my struggle and motive? I don't want to weaken myself by making you a part of my life. Fine. Don't let me be a part of your life. Your life and motive revolves around crimes and murders. You've just seen hatred. You can't love anyone. No one. This money is of no value, Mr. Deva. Because she has reached the stage where no medical science can help. What do you mean? I can't say how long she's going to live for. What kind of a disease is it? - Blood cancer. She had this disease since a long time. By the time she was brought here, it was already late. I am sorry. Hey, Deva. What is it, Deva? Why are you upset? Do you want to say something? - Doctor.. What did the doctor say? That I am going to die? I've known this for a very long time. Yes, Deva. Despite knowing this, I didn't upset myself. Do you know why? Because I love Jaya a lot. A lot. After her father's demise, she had been through a lot. After a long time, she has learnt how to smile. I didn't want to upset her by telling the truth. It's true that I was scared of death until now. But after meeting you, I am not scared anymore. I can peacefully die now. Will you do me another favour? Every mother has a dream of seeing her daughter getting married. Will you fulfil this dream of mine? "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." "I am scared of never being able to" "express my feelings to you." "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." "I am scared of never being able to" "express my feelings to you." "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." "You taught me" "what love is." "We've become close" "to each other." "You mesmerise me." "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." "I would toss and turn all night." "What do I say?" "I felt elated." "How do I tell you how" "scared I was all alone?" "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." "I am scared of never being able to" "express my feelings to you." "I couldn't say anything to you." "Neither could you say anything to me." Sir, Inder here. - Tell me, Inder. Sir, you must remember, I had told you that a few of our ministers are related to the drug mafia. Sir, I just got to know about their secret meeting. And I want you to reach there. Your presence is very important when they'll be arrested. I'll come, Inder. Where do I have to come? Delta tower, sharp at 11. Hello, Deva. - Tell me, Inder. Deva, I've got some news about Akash's murderers. I want you to reach Delta tower, sharp at 11:15. Okay. I'll be there. You all stay here. - Okay, sir. Inder? - Welcome, CM. Jindaal? Inder was a source to make us meet. Actually, I wanted to honour you for your honesty and faithfulness. What do you mean? - You don't like crowded places. That's why, I thought this place would be good for your demise. Kill him! Deva! Let's go, Munna. - Deva, you go. I'll stop them. Shoot him! No! Brother Inder.. Deva.. Munna. Munna.. - Let's go.. Let's go. - Munna. - Let's go. Shoot him! Come on. Hurry up! Follow him. Come on. Hurry up! Follow him! Come on, fast.. Hurry up! Mani. - Yes. Mani, go towards the village. - Yes, Deva. Mani, call for a doctor. - Yes, Deva. What is all this, Deva? I can't understand who is trying to manipulate me. I want to talk to ACP Saxena. - He's not in the office. Deva, I am asking you, what is all this? Jaya, Inder had called me there. Jindaal shot the CM. Had I left him there, they would've killed him. But the police saw me there and they'd think I killed him. I don't understand why Inder didn't reach there. Mr. Inder. Today our department and security is being questioned. When we can't secure our CM how will we secure the public? And I don't understand this. Despite the presence of a capable officer like you Deva and his gang took the CM along. I am disappointed. And this mistake of yours upsets me. Why didn't you arrange for the security when the CM had called you? Why did you take just a few officers? Sir, the way he spoke to me over the phone.. It was imperative for me to leave immediately. I did not have time to waste. But when I reached there, I saw Deva carrying the CM on his shoulders. It was very difficult for us to target him because the CM could've got hurt. Mr. Inder, I know about your relation with Deva. Despite that, I have faith in you. - Thank you, sir. I hope you always have faith in me. Sir, Deva is a criminal for me. Only a criminal. - Mr. Inder, we want Deva. Alive or dead. Sir, we've alerted all the 14 zones. We've sent agents to find out Deva's location. 200 officers are involved in this operation. All the exit points have been sealed. Don't worry, sir. Deva will be under arrest very soon. 'An important news.' 'This morning, at 11, Deva, a criminal, shot the chief minister.' 'His bodyguards tried to shoot Deva.' 'Despite trying hard' 'Deva escaped with the chief minister.' 'What might be the motive behind him trying to kill the CM' 'and then, kidnapping him?' 'The police department has still not given an answer.' I told you, I don't know anything about Deva. Why don't you trust me? I don't know where Deva is. Every person who comes here lies at first. But eventually, he speaks the truth. What? What do you mean? Look, the way you are treating me is not fair. You cannot bother a common man without any reason. I am also a lawyer. I know everything about the law. Your son is a wanted criminal. He's on the run and you're trying to teach me law! This is not fair, Officer. My son can't see me crying. If he gets to know about this he'll destroy everything. - Please, Inspector.. Are you satisfied now? I had told you that he knows nothing but you all.. Forgive us, Father-in-law. I am an honest man, Inder. I have never lied. No one in my family knows where Deva is. I know, Father-in-law. - I don't know. Deva.. - What happened? There's news about you in the television. What is it? Whoever tells them your whereabouts will be rewarded. Don't you want to get rewarded? - I don't want it. 'The police could not find where Deva is.' 'In the city..' - Look, ma'am. I have taken out the bullets. His condition is deteriorating. It's important to take him to the hospital. Otherwise, he might die. - How many times do I tell you that we can't take him to the hospital? Fine. Do what you feel is right. I can't stay here anymore. I want to go. That's all. Hey! Look where you are and who you are facing! I'll explain you things just once! I too want him to be alive. Not because he can save me but because he is a good human. Do you want to say anything else? What did we gain? What did we gain from it? I lost a close friend. Lal. And you couldn't do anything to Deva. You.. You didn't reach on time. And when you did reach there you went with your useless officers. Because of you all, Deva escaped. If he was killed then and there you would've been praised too. Your name would have been published in the newspaper. 'CM's culprit was killed on the spot.' Darn it. I shot the CM. What if he is alive and reveals everything? If I get into trouble Inder Saxena, it'll be your.. Mr. Jindaal, neither did you do your job. Who was responsible to kill the CM? You. But you missed it. - Don't shout, Inder Saxena. You are not in a position to shout at me! You can show your powers in your office. I am.. - Relax. Please, Mr. Jindaal. It's not about the power. I mean to say that whatever had happened.. Hello.. Hello. Inder is talking to Jindaal in such a way! I've got your clothes, ma'am. Here it is. - Here you go. But I don't have change. Let it be. You can give it to me tomorrow. - No. I'll get it right away. - It's okay. Get it tomorrow. - No. I'll get it now. She doesn't listen. What is this? Inder has become so careless. 'I found this pen near Akash's corpse.' 'The murderer is the one who has the cap of this pen.' It means, Inder.. Hello.. Hello.. Hello. - Hello. Hello. Brother? Brother, Guddi here. - Tell me, Guddi. Brother, can you listen? - Yes, Guddi. Tell me. Brother, I got to know.. - What, Guddi? Brother, I got to know.. Oh, God! - Guddi! Yes.. - Tell me. - Brother. Brother, can you hear me? - Yes, tell me. Brother, I got to know who killed Brother Akash. - Who? Brother! - Hello! Hello! Wow! Such immense love of a sister.. Now that's a rare sight. That's a rare sight. What were you going to tell him? That I killed Akash? Were you going to tell him that? Yes. I killed Akash. Don't be surprised. I hope you remember how your brother, Deva tore apart my brother, Vilas' hand. You just witnessed that sight. But I saw him die a painful death. You betrayed us. Relationships, love, marriage, everything. You've stooped so low, Inder. You killed my brother. The Almighty will never forgive you. He will not answer your prayers from here. One needs to be close to Him. To make a wish, you need to get closer to Him. Being my wife, you'll expose me? Come on. Where are you coming from? - From the airport. - Open the dickey. - Okay. Come on.. - Licence.. Licence.. - Yes.. Where are you going? - Yes.. - At this hour.. What did you.. - Move.. Inder.. This way.. Come on. What is the police doing here? - What are you doing, Deva? You wait here. I'll go and check. Let us go.. Hey, move the car. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama.. Is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. The name of Rama is the truth. 'By the way, Brother' 'the entire society is talking about you.' 'The way you bashed them was amazing.' 'Now, people will not mess with me.' 'First, let me adore my sister.' 'Brother, are you listening?' 'I got to know who killed Brother Akash.' Sage, I've come to take my daughter's last remains. Her brother already took it. Who? Deva? - Yes. That was his name. Think about the one you've lost. Shinde. What's the matter? Why is there so much of security? We've got an order from the commissioner, sir. Why? Is someone going to attack me? Go. They've tightened the security. Akash? Hello, Mr. Jindaal. Tell me, Inder. - I got to know. Weren't we confused as to what Guddi had found which made her realise who the real killers of Akash were? What was it? Actually, she found Akash's pen cap. That's why she was calling Deva to tell him this. Poor girl. The sister was also killed because of the brother. And she also handed us the last evidence of Akash's murder. Now, Akash's and Guddi's murder will be a mystery forever. And Mr. Jindaal I've been grieved since the day I saw my brother, Vilas' corpse. And now, finally, I can move on. And that.. Hello. Hell.. You're such a filthy man, Inder. Deva.. Look, Deva. Don't beat me. Think about your parents. Look, I am your brother-in-law. Here you go. What is this? My turn. Deva.. - Leave me. - Deva.. He's still alive. I won't spare him. Let me kill him. Let go! I will kill him. That's great. Mr. Jindaal must have learnt a lesson. Is it ringing? - Yes, sir. Hello. - Yes, sir. Pass the phone to your boss. He is not here. - He's not there? Yes, sir. - Where did he go? He's in the police station. - Police station? But why? - I don't know. He had a word with Mr. Inder and he is there since then. - Jindaal is just.. He must be licking Inder's boots again. He is out of his mind. Hey, give me the glass. Why are you shivering, Khan? You love killing people, don't you? - Deva, I.. You've killed people mercilessly. Your death can't be that easy, can it be? If you are scared, run! If that can help you escape your death, run. Run.. Run, Khan! Run! Save me.. Save me. I am Basharad Khan, your comrade. Deva wants to kill me. He will kill me. Save me! Basharad Khan? Basharad Khan? You're the one who gave drugs to helpless people like me and to children. I wonder how many murders you've committed. You ruined their families! And you expect them to help you! You're begging for your life? No. Don't spare him. Don't. He is a criminal. And a criminal can have no religion or family. A person like him should be killed and the Almighty wants the same. Deva, this too is your court. Serve justice right here, Deva. Look, ma'am. At least you try to understand. He is not getting better. Because of the bullet wounds, the poison in his body is spreading. I need to do a few operations to heal the wounds for which I have to go to the hospital and get a few equipment and medicines. Please let me go. Try to understand me. Okay but my men will come with you. - Thank you very much.. Come. Please have a seat. Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, Nurse. Look, pack all these equipment, fast. Okay. I'll get it. - I'll come right away. Hello. Can I speak to ACP Inder Saxena? - Inder here. I am Dr. Rane from Apollo hospital. Yes. Look, I know where Deva has kept the CM. He has kept him in an old fort near Malwani village. Yes. Look, he's serious. He needs to be taken to a nice hospital. Yes. His life can be saved. And Deva want to save him. Okay, sir? Mr. Jindaal, I've got two news. One is good and the other is bad. Which one would you like to hear first? It's been a long time since I heard a good news. Tell me the good news first. I got to know where Deva is hiding. The CM is still alive. And Deva wants to save him. Deva! Deva! Where is he? Tell me. Where is he? - What happened, ma'am? I need to meet him. Where is he? - Whom do you wish to meet? Made a call.. People of Devpura. The police has surrounded this place. If anyone tries to be loyal to Deva or act smart during this operation he will be shot at sight. Threat police force, move! Deva! Hey, Deva! You coward! Where are you hiding? Will you come out or do you want me to come and kill you? I am coming, you morons.. You've come to arrest my Deva? I'll burn each one of you. Come on.. Search every house. If you find the CM, kill him. Mom! They are our enemies! Don't spare them. Catch him.. - Don't spare him. Hey! - Don't spare him. Hey! Hit him.. Catch him! Ashok. - Let's go. Hurry up! Hurry up! This way.. - Sit here, ma'am. Hurry up, Mani. - Move.. Come on. - Close the door. Come out, Deva. Come out. Here I am. Where are you hiding? Come out. Deva! Where are you hiding, Deva? Show me what.. Hit him.. Hit him.. Hit him.. Hit him.. Hit him.. Hit him.. Hit him.. Hit him.. Hit him.. - Deva! Hit him.. Hit him.. To kill an animal, one needs to become an animal, Deva. One needs to become an animal. My son. Deva is innocent. Jindaal had shot me. ACP Saxena had asked me to come to Delta tower alone. When I reached, Jindaal was there and not Saxena.
