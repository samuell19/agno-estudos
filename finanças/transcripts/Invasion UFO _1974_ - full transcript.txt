INVASION: UFO Peter, please. Take Jean back to the car. I've must get this. Run! Run! Minister, this is Colonel Straker. - How do you do, sir? - The shattering business, coronel. Prime Minister's already of checkers. We'll be there in 30 minutes. We're been in constant communication with Paris, Moscow and Bonn... during our visits. I think the British government's approval is pure formality. The evidence is absolutely conclusive. - If I might... - Surely. It may speed things up. My God! The clincher is at the back. It's an enlarged single frame from the film, sir. It couldn't possibly be a fake? The film was found undeveloped still in the camera. It's genuine. Take my word for it. Keep pace with the escort. I'll take the file, sir. Would you turn around, colonel? - Ah, Colonel Straker. - Gentlemen. - Please sit down. - Thank you. First of all I should like to apologize on behalf of general Henderson. for his absence. As you probably know he's still recovering from injuries he received in the car crash. Thank you, colonel. No doubt you will make an excellent substitute. Now gentlemen I suggest the best way for us to proceed by a process of question, and answer. Colonel, as a representative of our respective governments, we are being asked to approve the largest financial appropriation ever envisaged for an international project. Two questions. Is the project, the whole project absolutely necessary? And if it is, are we getting value for money? I believe the setting up of SHADO is not only necessary but absolutely vital. Every day we just sit about and talk about it, the potential danger increases. As to your second question I believe this breakdown and expenditure might be helpful. Fleet of suppliers? Base on the moon? Satelites? If I might point out sir, we're confronted with alien spacecraft. Possibly from another solar system. Maybe the general and Colonel Straker have been reading too much science fiction. The Earth is faced with a power threat from an extraterrestrial source. We've moved into an age when science fiction has become fact. We need to defend ourselves. Then how long will it take to set up this defense organization? As I estimate seven to ten years. Ten years? But you say, Colonel, the danger is imminent. Yes sir, that's true but the type of organization we need can't be set up overnight. All I say is that any delay only increases the danger. And who will command this international band of Heroes? Well there is no question in my mind, gentlemen. There's only one man for the job. General Henderson, he's the obvious choice. Any further questions? Thank you, Colonel Straker. Monsieur Duvall. I understand you have three daughters. Yes. I pray that you will never find yourself looking down at one of their mutilated bodies. I hope that the next UFO incident is not in your hometown. Thank you for your time. It has been approved unanimously. You done a great job. Now I thought I'd screwed it up, sir, it's only in there about ten minutes. All they've got to do now is work 16 hours a day for the next 10 years. Sure. Oh, where there is another thing I had to tell you. They appointed the commander in chief. - Who? - You. - Me? - Again it was unanimous. It seems the French delegate Duval was particularly insistent. - But sir why... - Why not choose me? Oh, come on, let's not kid ourselves, colonel. What sort of shape of mine? What's gonna shape would I be in in 10 years time? Nonsense general. In a couple of months you'll be out of that thing up and about as fit as ever. You can always refuse, but if you do has got to be now. It'll be no turning back later. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - You're new, aren't you? - Uh-huh. - Must have passed all the tests. - All of them. I bet. (Knocking) "Good morning." Patrick. - Morning, Alec. - Morning, Pete. Won't keep you a moment, Alec. - Trouble? - Why else would I send for you? Take a look at this. That's Westbrook Electronics. - Yeah, what's left of it. - What happened? For ten years there have been setbacks. We've had accidents, miscalculations, errors of judgement and other mishaps. Let's put Westbrook Electronics down to... other mishaps. - You mean a UFO? - Well, there's no proof. Bang goes the Utronic project, just as we had something to locate them. No panic, Alec. The Utronic equipment is safe. It wasn't in the building. It's intact, fully tested and ready for shipment. The breakthrough. SHADO have had Moonbase and the other satellites operational for the past few months. There have been sightings, but no interceptions. We've got the teeth. Soon we'll have the eyes. Freeman, you know how important this is to our whole organisation. The Utronic design team and equipment are ready in LA to be flown here to England. I'm making you responsible for the security of the entire operation. I mean you. Personally. Right. It must be quite a while since you landed an SST. Just let's say it's part of the personal service. SHADO Control, this is Seagull X-Ray, confirm arrival Stevenson Base, Los Angeles, 08:35. Take-off scheduled 1100 hours. (Ford) Roger, Seagull X-Ray. - Call Moonbase, will you? - Yes, sir. (Ellis) Status check. - Target. - Affirmative. - Magnetic field? - Check. - Saturation density? - Green. - Resonator? - Affirmative. - Code. - OK. - Displacements? - Go. - Filters? - Check. - Fluctuation? - Affirmative. - (Beep) - Reflex? Excuse me. Right. - SHADO Control for you, Lieutenant. - Right. - Lieutenant Ellis. - Good morning, Gay. I have some action for you. I want Moonbase put on yellow alert from 10:45 to track Seagull X-Ray. It's carrying SHADO VIPs and the Utronic equipment. Let's keep everybody on their toes. - Can't afford to take chances. - Roger. Joan, announce a yellow alert for 10:45. - Yes, Lieutenant. - And complete the status check. I think this will be for real. I'm going to take a break. I'll be back about 10:30. OK. - Put Skydiver in the picture. - Yes, sir. (Buzzer) Message from SHADO Control, sir. Yellow alert at 10:45. Right. That last entry. - Did you send it? - Yes, sir. A refuelling schedule transmitted - on security code B? - Sorry, sir. - How long have you been here? - Two years, sir. Two years. Long enough to know how important security is to SHADO. Look, this headquarters, controlling Moonbase, the satellites and a fleet of submarines is 80 feet below a film studio, right? Now, 400 people work up there and not one of them knows all this exists. I have to play games, pretending to be the studio's chief executive. No one even dreams what my real function is. That's what security is all about. I'm sorry, sir. Sometimes it's pretty difficult. Difficult! So you think it's difficult, huh, Ford? Well, I'll tell you when it gets difficult. Have you ever thought about the victims of UFO incidents? Have you ever considered their parents, brothers, sisters? What do we tell them? They can never know the truth, so they live in agony for years, praying that some day their loved one may turn up, clinging to a thread of hope. Don't ever tell me that security's difficult. Sometimes it gets pretty close to home. Stevenson Base, this is Seagull X-Ray. Liftoff check complete. Liftoff clearance? (Man) Roger, Seagull X-Ray. You are clear to go. - Nina. 10:45. - Right. Brakes off. Airspeed building. 130... 140... 160 V1. VR. Rotate. This is Moonbase calling SID. This is Space Intruder Detector. Pass your message.

Trigger circuits OK. Right. Stand by for liftoff. SHADO Control from Sky One. Airborne. Position zero-two-zero red. (Ford) Roger, Sky One. Air speed down to 600 knots. - Right. Lower heat shield. - Right. I don't like it. These clouds give about as much cover as a G-string on a belly dancer. - Sky One to Seagull X-Ray. - Am I glad to hear you! - What's your position? - Right above you at 20,000. Sky One to Seagull X-Ray, have UFO on screen. Closing rapidly. - Roger. Ten degrees port. - Right. (Whirring) UFO at 12 o'clock. You are the target! Coming in to attack. UFO in clouds. Keep a sharp lookout. Roger. - (Explosion) - Hold her! Hold her steady. Sky One to SHADO Control. Reporting direct hit on UFO. -It's gonna crash into the sea. - Good shooting Sky One. Come in, Seagull X-Ray. Alec, are you OK? I've aged about five years but we're in one piece. Sky One. Follow it down, Captain. - Use your reconnaissance cameras. - Roger. Will do. It went straight under. It seems to be breaking up. Hold it! There's a body. Please confirm. Did you say body? Yes. It's a body. Commander Straker. - Is he alive, Doctor? - Yes. Well? The general analysis shows that he is humanoid. You mean... like us? More or less. Body temperature three degrees paranormal, blood pressure low, muscular development poor. The skin is an artificial green colour, probably from the liquid. However, the hair hasn't picked up this tint, suggesting the liquid may contain bioaquaphilic compound. That the eyes were protected by plastic shells supports this theory. We'll know more when we get the computer read-out from the first electro-medical check. It'll be a few minutes. A man... from a solar system perhaps a hundred million million miles from earth. - It's incredible. - What is? We can't be certain yet, but this test shows organ and gland transplants. Heart, liver... left lung, thyroid. D'you realise what this could mean, Alec? - It's still theory. - Theory. Fact. After almost ten years of possible, probable, and confirmed UFO incidents. Fact. On a number of fully documented occasions, mutilated bodies found after UFO attacks. Organs missing. Fact. An electro-medical examination on the first alien we get shows organ transplants. - The doctors aren't certain. - No. Not yet. But I bet that our proof lies at the end of that corridor. Dr Shroeder? Intensive care unit. We have an emergency. (Gasps) (Monitor beeps) I'm afraid he's dead. - When can I have a postmortem? - 48 hours. Make it 24. Not the details. Just what really matters. The rapid ageing isn't documented in the report. We're not sure, but it's connected with the reaction of earth's atmosphere on the body. Gentlemen, let's concern ourselves with the three main questions regarding UFOs. One, where do they come from? The fact that the lungs were filled with an oxygenated liquid seems to indicate a subjection to phenomenal acceleration and fantastic speed over a long period. Long enough for the skin to pick up the green colouration of the liquid. All this would appear to add up to an extended journey through space, perhaps several months at many times the speed of light. Question number two, who are they? Obviously, in science and technology, several hundred years in advance of man. But everything in this report seems to add up to a dying race. Hereditary sterility was evident. But by using drugs and advanced transplant techniques, they could have found a way to stop the natural ageing process. They're also highly intelligent, so they come to earth knowing the risk of contact with our atmosphere. Which brings us inevitably to question number three... why do they come? This report indicates five major organ and gland transplants. In the case of the heart, tissue compatibility tests show that it was human in origin. It came from earth, gentlemen. Therefore one of the reasons they must obviously come is to obtain organ replacements. But there may be other reasons. Imagine a dying planet in some distant corner of the universe, its natural resources exhausted, its inhabitants sterile, doomed to extinction. A situation we may one day find ourselves in, gentlemen. So they discover earth, abundant and fertile, able to satisfy their needs. They look upon us not with animosity but with callousness, as we look upon our animals whom we depend on for food. Yes... it would appear they are driven by circumstance across a billion miles of space, driven on by the greatest force in the universe - survival. Liftoff complete. Onboard read-out is go. Roger. You are clear for EO. Out. Lunar Module to Control: separation A-OK. This is Lunar Module to Moonbase Control. Have visual contact. Roger, Lunar Module. Have you on track for auto landing. The Lunar Module with Colonel Freeman on board is docking now. Hello, Gay! Shall we start? - Hello, Nina! - Hello, Colonel! - How's everything going? - Fine. - How are things, Joan? - Fine, sir. - Is that your report? - You'll find everything's in order. I'm sure I shall. Shall we continue? Red alert. Red alert. Confirm Unidentified Flying Object. This is Moonbase Control. Red alert. Repeat, red alert. Interceptors, immediate launch. Interceptor 3: R-checks A-OK. Interceptor 2: R-checks A-OK. Interceptor 1. R-checks A-OK. Switch to radio link 4, onboard computer waveband 066. Confirm speed 0,SOL 8. Bearing? - 342-047. - That's it, don't lose it. Base to Interceptors. Have the UFO on positive track. - Speed SOL 0,8. - Speed SOL 0,8. Bearing 342-047. UFO maintaining course. Predict Interceptors in range 51 seconds. Control to leader: get onboard computer for the autocount. Roger. Missile launch: 5 seconds. 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Have visual contact with explosion. Detonation positive. Did they get it? - I still have a contact, Lieutenant. - Double-check. Positive. Predict UFO on collision course with Interceptors. Impact: 32 seconds. Interceptor 2, alter course to 024-201. Impact: 14 seconds. Interceptor 1 to Base. Request new course. 1 to Base. Request new course! Control to Interceptor 3. Alter course to 124-186. 9 seconds. Interceptor 1 to Base. Request new course. Control do Interceptor 1, alter course to 024-218. It's too late, Lieutenant. Come in, 1. Come in, 1. Impact confirmed. Interceptor 1 destroyed. Why, Alec? - You've read the report. - Yes. An astronaut killed, a UFO through the outer defences. The report tells me what happened, I want to know why. I don't really know. - Alec, I know you better than that. - Things happened so fast. - Meaning? - I can't be sure. I'll look all. Settle for an educated guess, Alec. The error could have been human. A decision was taken, it could have worked, but it didn't. Right. I want the 2 surviving astronauts and Lieutenant Ellis back here on the next moon flight. Right. Oh, what happened to the UFO? We lost it in a radar blind spot. But one thing's certain: it landed. Landed? Where? Just about the worst place possible. Somewhere in an area of 50,000 square miles in northern Canada. Everything we got that flies is out looking for it. Have completed grid search. Nothing to report. OK, skiper. See you in one hour. No, I'm going around again. It'll stay light long enough for one more run. Have relocated UFO in area blue. - Straker. - We've picked it up. Great. I'll be right there. Thank you, Greenland. - Where is it? - Crossing the Atlantic seaboard. Speed is down. The Interceptors must've damaged it. - Right. Alert Sky 1. - Right, sir. hovering-off at ten thousand. This is SHADO Control. UFO 48 miles from your present position. Thanks, Control. I have it on the scope. Have visual contact. Closing for attack. Sky 1 reports a hit but UFO has turned and is still airborne. Signal all radar stations. Tell the commanders if they lose it this time, they'll answer to me. Get some rest, Alec. You look tired. SHADO Control to all radar tracking stations. UFO has been hit, but is still airborne. When it lands, let me know its exact position. The UFO has landed, but this time, we know where. Exact position? Close enough to Lexfield Air Base for you to be there by first light. - Fine. - I want them, Alec. I want them alive. The Transporter's just landed at Lexfield, Canada, sir. Fine, fine. SHADO Mobiles 1, 2 and 3, proceed to search the area. This is Control. In position on airfield perimeter. The other Mobiles are on their way, sir. Good. SHADO Mobile 1 to Control. In position. - Roger, 1. - No visual contact. - SHADO Mobile 2 in position, sir. - SHADO Mobile 3 in position. - All three Mobiles in position, sir. - Good. - Send one in. - Which one, sir? The one in the best position. Standard procedure. Control to SHADO Mobile 3. - Close in for final assault. - Roger, Control. They should be able to see it any second. There it is! - Have visual, 300 yards ahead. - Any sign of movement? No, nothing. We're going in closer. Right. Take it easy. - SHADO Mobile 3 under attack. - Head back to the ridge. We're still under fire. It seen he use some... SM 3, can you hear me? Come in, SM 3. Radio and tracking link negative. They must've been hit. Send the next one in. I know the risk. Send it in. This is Control to SHADO Mobile 1. Close in on UFO. Roger. This is Colonel Freeman. Assume SM 3 is non-operational. Stop just below the ridge and proceed on foot. - I repeat, proceed on foot. - Understood. OK, let's go. Roger. Backup forces in position and standing by, sir. OK, fan out. They're closing in, sir. Take cover! Keep down! Look out! The UFO, sir! Get down! He appears to be humanoid and highly intelligent. The biosensor tells us his eyes and ears are in excellent condition. Computer reports indicate he's in perfect health. There must be some way we can communicate. You've been interrogating him for 43 minutes. How much longer? Why? We must remove the compound from his hair to assist oxygen absorption. All right, all right. Now, let's go over it once again. The answers are needed to certain questions. I'm asking you to cooperate. It's no good, Alec. He either can't or doesn't want to understand. There's no alternative. I'll try one of the new anodynes to break down his resistance. Which do you recommend, Doctor? GL-7 is the most effective in my experience but... - but in this case... - Well? I can't guarantee the results. It could be dangerous. - How dangerous? - Who knows? But the decision and the responsibility must be yours. Your reactions are all right, you heard that clearly enough. All right, Doctor. Now, the drug will lower your resistance, it's no use fighting it. You must help us. You must cooperate. Pulse rate increasing. Still increasing. Hold him. Hold him down! - How long's it been this quiet? - Since you went into hospital. That was a month ago. There've been no sightings since then? Just two. The Interceptors took care of them. We managed to scratch along without you, Paul. Hey, Skipper. Ellis here. You better come up and have a look. There's something alongside. - Probably the latest submarine. - Be straight up. Where's this monster of the deep? - It must have come from that sub. - What's happening? - I don't know. - Get some men on that fire! Under attack... submarine. Airborne missiles... look like flying fish. Under attack...! Kingston! Kingston! Come in! Mayday! Mayday! Deep Space Probe 87 calling. - Deep Space Probe 87 calling. - Control receiving. Come in, 87. 25 UFOs massing. Concentrating in area NML-12. 'We've been seen. UFOs approaching. Taking evasive action. DSP-87, come in! Come in! 87, can you hear me? 87, come in! This is Space Intruder Detector, relaying report from Watchdog. UFOs mantening position in area NML-12. Captain, I want you to proceed to the area where the freighter Kingston was sunk. I'm having instructions prepared. I'll contact you in 30 minutes. Take her down to the sea bed. Let's have a look around there. What's the latest on Watchdog? No change. UFOs still in stationary position, sir. What the places they're waiting for? Well, colonel, what does the computer think? With so little information, it's reluctant to give an answer. But I insisted, A- they're either waiting for a-reinforcements. B - bad weather to negate radar or, or C - non-operation of defences, namely SHADO Control. We know there are no signs of reinforcements, and weather forecast for the next month is excellent and SHADO certainly won't cease operations. I suggest the next batch of information you feed in, add a drop of castor oil. How's the water temperature? 15 degrees higher than the surface. - Still rising. - Maybe the volcano's active? No, we checked that. Get SHADO Control. Yes, sir. Skydiver for you, Commander. Thank you. Yes, Captain? We're in the search area. Water temperature near volcano 30 degrees higher than normal. I see. Thank you, Captain. I'll call you back in a minute. Stop engines! - Temperature rise of three degrees. - Captain! Evasive action! - Periscope depth! Slowly. - Aye aye, sir. Good work, Captain. Resume your original search. And Captain... watch yourself. Yes, sir. It seems a UFO is using that volcano as a front door to the Atlantic. Skydiver found the reason for the rise in water temperature. - What was that? - An undersea cable. The UFO was using it as an energy supply. But they can travel underwater on their own power. Yes, for short distances. - You think it's been to Cornwall? - It looks that way. Then there must be an energy plant under the volcano. And if the water temperature is so high... it's generating a lot more power than is needed to drive one UFO. Yes. I wonder what Skydiver will find at the end of that cable. Look! - Captain, what's the news? - Nothing, sir. It appears to be completely smooth. - Any entrance? - None we can see. - Let's go and have a closer look. - Dive. Lieutenant. You know Colonel Foster? I think a cup of Skydiver coffee would be just great. Come on, Paul. Let's get our water wings on. After you've dropped us, get out of sight, Captain. We'll rendezvous back here in 45 minutes. Yes, sir. Testing radio link. Receiving. Five by five. There it is. Take it easy, Paul. I think I've found something. Around this side. OK, Paul, Lead the way. Just here. Could be some kind of porthole or window. It's possible. Try scraping away the outer layer. It's coming. There's been a UFO. In unknown country, I think it's better to travel light. 53 minutes to go. Well, let's see what wonders await us down here. Let's try this way. As good as any. Ever had that feeling you've been here before? Yeah, sure looks familiar. But why? SHADO Control to SID. SHADO Control to SID. Come in, SID. SHADO Control to Moonbase. Come in, Moonbase. Moonbase receiving you, SHADO Control. UFOs approaching from NML-12. Do not attempt to intercept. Repeat, do not attempt to intercept. Do not understand. Do not understand. You say do not intercept? Is this correct?' Correct. Commander Straker's orders. UFOs to be dealt with by earth's defences. Over and out. Do not understand. You say do not intercept? That's correct? Correct, Skydiver. Commander Straker's orders. UFOs will be dealt with by ground defences. Over and out. The computer was right. They planned to take over SHADO Control and let those UFOs through. How did they get our voices? They've recorded our communications. By using the words they need, they can make us say anything they want. Why all this elaborate miming? Don't forget, they will be seen on the TV screens. Come on, Paul. Let's go. Load the tubes. Yes, sir. We'll split up. One of us will stand a chance. OK. First back stops the countdown. No, there isn't time. They're making their move. - Good luck, Paul. - Good luck. 8 minutes. Only another 8 minutes. Captain! Thank God! Did you see Commander Straker? No, sir. The massed UFOs are moving out of area NML-12. Must presume attack course. - Any sign of the commander? - No, sir. - Arm the torpedoes. - Torpedoes armed, sir. Fire 1. Fire 1, sir. 1 away, sir. Colonel Foster! - Fire 2. - Yes, sir. Fire 2. 2 away, sir. UFOs now on positive track. Heading for earth at attack velocity in 2 waves. Message received. Commander, they're on their way. Now. SHADO Control to Moonbase. Attack and destroy second wave of UFOs. Red alert. Red alert. Interceptors, immediate launch. - Skydiver. - SHADO Control to Skydiver. Attack and destroy first wave of UFOs. Understood. One UFO as change the trajectory. Predict target: This satelite. Interceptor 2, lock onto new bearing 330. 3-3-0. I've been hit... You wanted to tell me something. Yes. I wanted to have a word with you before you flew out. - It's about my sister, isn't it? - Yes. I'm afraid she's dead, Peter. There's no longer any doubt. I think you know how sorry I am. What happened? I don't think you'd like to know the details. I think I'd like to know. Your sister was last seen in the vicinity of a UFO incident nearly ten years ago. The alien's body recovered from the sea was object of intense medical examination. The heart was a transplant. The donor was Leila Carlin. - What will you tell your parents? - I don't know. You realise, of course, that they can never know the truth. (Straker) A funeral without a body. A symbol of human compassion. The long finger of tragic coincidence. stretching across a billion miles of space. Is this the end or the beginning? Where does the universe end? Where does it begin?
