Marriage in the Shadows After a novella by Hans Schweikart This film was made collaboratively by Friedl Behn-Grund and Eugen Klagemann as cameramen Otto Erdmann, Franz F. Fürst and Kurt Herlth as architects Wolfgang Zeller as composer Karl Tramburg as sound man Alice and Hermann Ludwig as editors Screenplay and direction: Kurt Maetzig with the actors: and Ferdinand Oh, now I can no longer write. Death, death revokes every oath. Heaven and earth have nothing more unhappy than us! I die guiltless, Ferdinand! What is she saying there? One normally doesn't take a lie on this kind of journey? I'm not lying. Not lying. I've only lied once in my life when I wrote the letter to the Chamberlain. God be praised! Now I feel like a man once again! This letter... make yourself ready to hear a terrible word. My hand wrote what my heart condemned. Your father dictated it! Ferdinand, I was forced. Forgive me. But the danger, they are so cunning. God be praised! I still don't feel the poison. Murderers! They will both be excellent in the new Zuckmayer play! Elizabeth improves with every role. She's developing marvellously! I also prophesise a great career for Hans Wieland. Herr Director, you've got to take good care of both of them! And for two such excellent actors one needs an excellent stage director and you, dear Bernstein, must direct the Zuckmayer And I'd take poison myself, if that play will not be performed not fifty but a hundred times! Love and Intrigue Herr Director, Dr. Blohm would like to speak with you. - Yes, I'm coming. Congratulations, Herr Fehrenbach! This performance was possibly even better than the première! - There will be a party after, yes? - I should think so! I would love to, but... But bring me a good play for Ms. Maurer we haven't had such a good performer in years. Elisabeth Maurer! Maurer! Elisabeth Maurer! The Will to Power Attempt at a Revaluation of all Values Elisabeth Maurer In memory of 'Love and Intrigue' Berlin, February 1933 Dr. Herbert Blohm I would like to keep acting like that, forever. That's how it has to continue! Oh Hans, I'm so sad that that was the last performance! - But we start rehearsals again in 8 days! - Yes, but... - Elisabeth, you were wonderful, again. - Oh but Hans, you were much better! Thank you, my dear! A great success! Elisabeth, I'd just like to say that reminds me very much of when I was... My dear sir, very kind, but Ms. Maurer really needs to rest now. May I bother you for a moment? The painter manqué Tornow has permitted himself to execute an immortal red chalk drawing of the great actress. That pleases me so! It looks like something so nice and personal. Just a little wall decoration from the humble stage manager... No, the drawing will have a place of honour. Just a moment, please! Thank you. - I'll take you home, Elisabeth. - No, Hans, you're tired too. - I'll just take a taxi. - Then let's take one together. Hopelessly, as soon as you compel him to love you Yes, that's the way it's supposed to go. And I said: as soon as he must love her. Oh, it's exasperating. - You're never satisfied with yourself. - No, I'm never satisfied with myself. I liked it. Come my dear, let's get out of here, there's such a draught. Where should we spend the few vacation days in absolute quiet? - Alone? - Well... perhaps... I admire you, Elisabeth! This exciting force and this warmth that you radiate! Please. Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power. How thoughtful. But now I really must change. But hurry, there's something we have to celebrate! - Ach, better not. - What do you mean, better not? No, really, Fehrenbach, I'm so tired, and the restaurants are so full and loud. That's a real pity though, everyone's so looking forward to it. - Especially Dr. Blohm. - Oh, all right. I don't want to be a spoilsport. Come on over to my place. That's nice, good, I'll tell the others. Here, my dear Hanni, I've brought you something. - What's with the coat, Ms. Maurer? - It's for Ruth! For me? No. And you gave me so much for Christmas. But Ruth, if I could do you a favour as well? You can, my dear! This very evening, yet! Come along and help me a bit in the kitchen. I'd just like to know why I had to come along. Believe me, I'm after the young artists like a Pope to find the right role for you but our modern writers don't have this... primal instinct. They write from the head and not from the blood. But listen, the Zuckmayer we're doing is very beautiful. I'm seeking something for you... fire behind ice that's what you are. Uh-huh, I see. Wedekind. You want to see the Lulu in her. I see the Luise in her. Just a moment. You don't have to get worked up about this quite yet. I'm going on vacation for 8 days. I should really be thinking about where I want to go. Oh, don't get up! Yes, you've got to relax for once. - The best thing would be somewhere - where no one can reach you. What do you think of the Allgäu? In a cottage somewhere. Yes, I already thought of Oberstdorf. But I'd rather go somewhere where it's really solitary. But such a cottage is... please, stay seated, I'll get it. You're looking for solitude? Travel to... Hiddensee. Hiddensee? Yes! Let the wind blow properly around your ears! And breathe in the salt air in winter! The sea? In winter? It's marvellous! I have a small rebuilt fishing cottage there and my friend Paul will take care of us. - Your friend? - He's harmless. An older chap. Makes art pottery. I'm afraid I can't come, my publishing house takes too much of my time lately. - Look who's here! - Hello! Listen, everyone! A terrific plan! I'm going to Hiddensee for 8 days! - What, now? In storm and rain? - Precisely because of storm and rain! No, no, Elisabeth! You'll get ill and you won't be able to do my Zuckmayer! Totally meshuggah, but we'll come along. I'll take my combat boots, my old umbrella, my canary... you'll come along too, Hans. - Yes, I'll go. - Of course you'll both come along. That way I won't be so alone. Isn't it splendid here, Hans! That was really the right suggestion! - Elisabeth... - But Hans! What is it? Did the kiss irritate you? Oh you, that wasn't meant seriously. - Elisabeth... - But Hans, as Ferdinand and Luise we've kissed every evening for fifty evenings! Well, yes... Thalatta! Thalatta! I salute you, eternal sea! I salute you ten thousand times with a jubilant heart! So, Hans, now I really am hungry. - Hans! The cows are being milked! - Yes, here. - How about a nice drink of milk warm from the cow? - Yes, that would be nice! Now why don't you set yourself down in the hay? Time flies for lovers! Oh, Herr Wieland and I are not really a couple... Nanu, and you're so well suited to each other! Oh, nonsense. Am I an actor, or am I not? You're one of a kind, in my opinion! I learned Saxon dialect in two days. And we've been here now a whole week. - Yes, the time has passed very quickly. - Because it's so beautiful here. - It was an excellent idea Blohm had. - Blohm, Blohm, always Blohm. We'd have come up with the idea ourselves. Heisa! Hopsa! Hirirundei! So much fun here! And we're not part of it! A hearty welcome, and make yourself comfortable! My vase is almost done. Afterwards we can drink properly to Blohm's arrival. Come, bring up a stool! Hmm! I'll go help. Now, this is really quite a surprise. But both of us should really have changed. What do you mean changed? Let me stand out a bit! So, what have your brought from Berlin? Rum! A respectable brand, too! Well, that's a lovely thing, but I meant what news? Politics is getting lively! And one has to be careful that the right people are put in the right places. Here are the right places. Everyone gathered together here is after all, simply, or more precisely, thank God, an artist. We can not give a damn about politics. Cheers! Politics is fate, Napoleon once said. If you think that they can just let things go... Kids, I've been listening to your speeches for three hours now. Now I've had enough. I can only say that the modern state is not a primeval forest. Whether the stronger ones are always the better ones... But that's not really how I meant it. After all, the National Socialists came to power though their will. One should give them the chance to prove what they can do. I don't think much of the will to power. Humaneness is is what one should propagate. I believe we need a strong hand. No. We need a clear head. But that only looks so bad at the beginning. The agitators will retreat into the background once there are reasonable people who join in. Perhaps it's the reasonable people who'll push the whole system out of control. Why are you worrying yourself about this? This has nothing to do with you. On the contrary! Artists will do marvellously under any any circumstances. I only care about my work and that may be a good thing. But since Hitler's been there I've had an uncanny feeling. Oh, it's horribly smoky in here. You're right, Elisabeth. Tomorrow you'll breathe clear sea air. Only sky and sea. Happiness doesn't come to you, you have to take it. We must take it for ourselves. I need it. And you need me too, whether you recognise it or not. My will and your fire when that comes together it will be like lightning! Who lights the fire? Are you afraid? No, but Hans Wieland will be sad. Tell me, Hans, why didn't Elisabeth come over today? - She's sailing with Dr. Blohm. - Hmm. And you don't mind? What do you mean? That's Elisabeth's business, she can do what she likes. It's all the same to me. Uncle Bernstein? What do I have here? There? Wait a sec... an elephant. I can't hold that in one hand! - A frog. - I wouldn't touch a frog. You're totally right, my dear girl. Well, then I don't know. - Exactly the same as you. - As me? A Bernstein, Uncle Bernstein! Yes, my dear girl, but I'm no longer so smooth and shiny! Come here... - Aren't you a Jew, Herr Bernstein? - Yes. - Does that bother you? - No... I'm just asking because there's so much about it in the newspapers these days. Written, yes... there's ever more baiting going on. Yes, as if there weren't good people among the Jews, just like among the Christians. - That long, it was that long... - Great... the flounder, and the mackerels, and all sorts of other things. A pity you didn't come along. The next time you must absolutely come along, Kurt. You really won't regret it. Yes, we'll see... I believe... I will never see Hiddensee again. - Why? - What are you saying? Jews not welcome Splendid chap, this Kurt. Bad for him. We'll still get together later, yes? No, I'd prefer to be alone. I'm sad. - Elisabeth! - Won't you regret it? - Regret? - What, didn't you know, that I'm also a Jew? - You never said anything to me about that. - Is that so important to you? No, no. Don't ask me such a thing. I love you so. I believe you. I want to believe you. But later, in Berlin? Papers, please! Night edition! First report of the Reichstag fire! The Reichstag Burns - That's insane! - What is it now? Herbert... this is so strange... Please stop for a moment in the Greifswalder Strasse. I'd like to see if my uncle is all right. Will you come with me, Kurt? Dr. Louis Silbermann, Practising Physician Ah! This will make Uncle Louis happy. Yes, of course. Come on in. - Goodbye, Herr Doctor. - Goodbye. - Ah, it's you! - Hello, Uncle Louis! We've just come back from vacation and wanted to see how you are. Hello, my dear Bernstein! It's really good of you to make such an expedition to the far East. Come to the window, I want to see if you've really relaxed properly. Ach, Uncle Louis, it was lovely, there. But here, this Reichstag fire has us worried. We arrived right in the middle of a Nazi demonstration. - I find it somewhat frightening. - Yes, it's directed against us. Us? It really has nothing to do with us. If the mood doesn't change soon, I will leave the country. And if it really does get that bad all the more reason why I can't leave. What will happen to the people who work for me, to my patients? Don't misjudge the Nazis. Since you're talking about demonstrations against the Jews, let me just show you a demonstration for the Jews. - Herr Doctor! - Good day! Good day! They also still have something to say in this matter. So it can't get that bad. Yes, now is when people will see who their friends are. For all these reasons, the position of the artist in our new state will be a much respected one and unimaginable possibilities of development will be opened up. Therefore I once again demand that you do everything possible so that our new art will conquer the world. Heil Hitler! Well, there's nothing to object to in that! It was all very reasonable, no? The speech didn't do anything for me. I'd have preferred him to have expressed himself more clearly. Is that really an adequate ground for criticism? I'd have liked to hear the man's position regarding Kurt Bernstein and Elisabeth Maurer. Good day, Herr Wieland! When will Ms. Maurer be coming? Oh, certainly sometime today. Listen, Wieland, on no account do I mean to offend you, but as old comrades, I think we can be honest with each other, and I've nothing against Ms. Maurer as an actress. Excuse me, Herr Doctor, I... But, we shouldn't deceive ourselves, in the end, she won't be good for the theatre. - Let's see how the Directors decide. - That has nothing to do with it. To be blunt about it: we don't want that here any more! What does that mean, "We don't want that here any more?" Have you gone insane? What are you presuming to say? - It's a matter of purifying German culture! - Purifying? And don't you notice that you are insulting decent and gifted people? Nonsense! Racial ideals are at stake here! Racial ideals? Professional jealousy, nothing more! But that is all non-objective... We all know that he has personal reasons... - I have no personal reasons, you imbecile! - Oh, Herr Wieland! You will regret that. Don't take him so seriously. It won't be so bad. Hello, Herr Wieland! You're already here? Where is Miss Maurer? Yes, Miss Maurer is probably still coming today... But Mrs. Hallwig, what will become of you? Ach, I'll take care of my mother. And my husband is Aryan, nothing can happen to us. - Nothing can happen? - Yes, he'll protect us. So, how did you like Hiddensee? Was it a good suggestion? Wonderful. Come, let's see how Elisabeth is doing after the car ride. Herbert! Yes, we met quite by chance. I just wanted to ask quickly how you're doing, and then I've got to go. That's a pity. No, I absolutely have to get to the theatre to discuss a programming schedule with Fehrenbach, he seems to be having great difficulties with it. - But you really can stay. - No, that is, goodbye. Elisabeth, you've got me completely confused I can't think clearly until I am with you again. - I was also expecting you, Herbert. - I absolutely had to come! Although especially these days, I need an absolutely clear head. - Yes, is there something new? - Oh, yes, a great deal! Besides my publishing house, I'm supposed to take on a major new leadership position. A sort of... cultural organisation. A state position? That is to say, the organisation as such will of course be supervised by the State. But, I'm supposed to have full powers. I'm entirely independent. - So... a state position, after all? - But that changes nothing between us. Well, Herbert, what will people say? What do you mean, 'people'? Your friends, for example when they hear about me. That doesn't interest me. Fine, we'll have to be a little careful in the beginning. By the way, it's good that your parents died abroad. We'll surely be able to do a little magic with the papers. Uh... would you like to see our photos? You know me, I'm in the Jurists' Association and they asked me to join. Yes, Herbert, do you know what that means? For the individual, that has no meaning. On the contrary, that's how I can acquire the proper influence. Do you understand? I can prevent abuses, and, you know, of course, never in my life will I allow myself to be put in the position of doing anything that could harm decent people. What's up? You're packing? Yes. I'd have come to see you and Elisabeth this evening in any case. Unfortunately, everything's going exactly as I had feared. It's pointless to stay. I'm convinced that they'll throw me out of the theatre soon. But, Kurt... you're being far too pessimistic. This can only be a transitional phase. My dear Hans, the two of us need not fool ourselves. If all the democratic forces in Germany couldn't prevent this regime, I tell you, this avalanche can now no longer be held back. I'm going to Vienna. I've got a role there. Maybe you're right, from your point of view. You're alone, you have no family. But the others? What should they do? They're tied to this place with a thousand threads. Hans, don't deceive yourselves. There's something terrible coming. But seeing as you're here, at least make yourself useful and help me pack. But Elisabeth, you know perfectly well this whole story with the Jews is directed only at a few undesirable elements who've immigrated from the East! But certainly not against people like you! No. You're excluding us from society. Well, how then? You see, of course, we can no longer see each other. But Elisabeth, I already said how we can always find somewhere to see each other. Somewhere... secretly... Are you really asking that of me? Elisabeth, I'll return. I have to. I'm urgently expected. But trust me, I'll arrange it all. We've got to discuss the whole thing properly. It won't be so bad. Here, Herr Dr. Blohm, I brought along your mail from the publishing house. Thank you. Come, Herr Blohm, you've got to get to the Doctor's talk about the new Ministry. You're supposed to be getting some great tasks: purification of culture and so on. You'll manage it. The Doctor doesn't like to be kept waiting. Thank you. That looks so bare, where did you put the thing? Come, come. - Run through it once, Herr Wieland. - OK Were it better, I should rush in thus. But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride? How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown; And wherefore gaze this goodly company, As if they saw some wondrous monument, Some comet or unusual prodigy? Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day, First were we sad, fearing you would not come... - Hello, my dear. - Hello, Wim. Good that you came. I've been needing to tell you something for days. Yes, what is it? You know, itt's an unpleasant story. But please don't come to rehearsals for the time being. - Not come to rehearsals? - No. - Why? Because, God, please don't make this so difficult for me. You know, I had to cancel the new Zuckmayer play and now I'm having problems on your account. - Who? - Child, I can't do what I want now too. Be patient. They won't last long. It won't be so bad. And wherefore gaze this goodly company, As if they saw some wondrous monument, Some comet or unusual prodigy? Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day... Please... But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my lovely bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss! OK, that's enough for now. Short pause. Elisabeth. I'm so sorry. I did come to you. I actually wanted to speak with you on the subject but then Dr. Blohm arrived. - Oh, never mind, Hans. - Didn't he say anything to you? - I mean, he has to know. - No. Poor Fehrenbach, he wanted so much to be decent. Tell me, Elisabeth, can't Dr. Blohm intervene somehow? No. I don't want that. He has so much to do and anyway we probably won't see each other ever again. Elisabeth, I've never had the courage to say this to you before and this may not be the right moment but I will always be there if you need me. - For, Elisabeth... - You're a good friend, Hans, but... Newspapers, magazines, travel reading... careful, please... newspapers, magazines, travel reading... So, I'll be totally honest, I have no firm engagement in Vienna yet. The assault on the theatre is awful but I would rather shine shoes over there than stay here, caught as if in a mousetrap. You should come too! We'll make it through somehow! No, Kurt. I'm staying here. You don't know what you're in for here! Believe me, I know why I'm leaving. Don't stay here, I implore you! Don't stay here! I think one shouldn't give up too quickly. Look, Elisabeth has her flat here and abandoning our Berlin, well... Yes, and Hans has just been offered great roles he couldn't possibly turn those down. And things have to improve soon... Please take your seats, doors are closing... The train to Vienna... Please take your seats, all on board! Please take your seats, doors are closing... Night edition! Elisabeth, when are we getting married? - Hans? - Yes, Elisabeth. We are getting married. We should have done it a long time ago. - I already wanted to say it in Hiddensee. - I will bring you misfortune. No, no, Elisabeth. You won't make me misfortune. Look, Elisabeth, we love each other. - Elisabeth? - Yes. 5th Anniversary Hans and Elisabeth Wieland Uncle Louis, I think it's time for a toast! Yes, a toast, Uncle Louis, definitely, a toast. One moment. One never knows. 'Keep yourself in silence pure And let it storm around you. The more you feel that you are human, The closer you are to the gods,' says Goethe. When Uncle Louis quotes somebody, it's always Goethe. And you still always interrupt my speeches as you did in May. Forgive her, Uncle Louis. I forgive and continue. The more you feel that you are human the more you understand these words today. But when I can be with the two of you then do I feel properly human. It's been difficult for the two of you these last five years. No, Uncle Louis. It's been easy for us. For we love each other. No heckling! Pardon. We wonder, in nature, at the beauty of gemstones. They are produced by immense pressure and unimaginable heat. It is our hope that the pressure and the glow of the hate that surrounds us today will produce gemstones of love and examples of a humanity that will someday sparkle in the sun of freedom like precious stones. And you are two such gemstones. Stay that way. I thank you, my dear Uncle Louis. The bit about the gemstones, I got that from the encyclopaedia. I would also like to congratulate you. I so much like being with both of you but I'd feel better if you weren't in Germany. What's wrong? Are you not feeling well? I've been feeling unwell for some time now. - Come visit me in my office tomorrow. - Will I have to wait long? No, my child, in my office now, nobody has a long wait. Dr. Louis Israel Silbermann, Medic licensed exclusively for the treatment of Jews. So, of course I won't get a job now and now we must also give up our assets. If only we still had our passports then we could visit the World's Fair in New York and immigrate illegally. I've heard it's possible to gain entry to Paraguay for 6000 Marks. For me that would be a lifesaver. But for you, as a businessman, it can't possibly get so bad. Hitler himself said: the Jews must leave the State and culture, but in business they won't be touched. Oh, I don't know if it will stay that way. I want out! So, there's no reason to worry. I'll prescribe a couple of tonics for the girl. Doctor, I'm actually here for a completely different reason. Yes, what is it? The Gestapo was there this afternoon. They wanted to take my husband luckily, he wasn't home. I've already spoken with him, he's waiting at the house of some friends. What should we do? Please, help me. He should come this evening after dark to the Jewish Hospital. I will immediately operate on his appendix. An operation? I always say the people in America can judge much better what's going on. But if they see how serious our situation is, then they can't make it so difficult for us to immigrate! - Goodbye. - Next, please! - Ach, Elisabeth! - One of these gentlemen is next. - If you're in a hurry, go next, madam. - Thank you. Once again, Uncle Louis, thanks so much for yesterday. It was lovely to be so happy together again. Yes, I also found Hans so amusing and outgoing. He is always so sweet to me. But I have him so seldom. I actually sit at home all the time and wait. - The jacket too? - Yes, my child. It's awful to be so cut off from everything. No theatre, I'm not allowed to go to lectures. I, too, used to enjoy a good concert, but since all that has been forbidden to us, I've become more thoroughly acquainted with my bookshelves. So, where's the problem? I constantly have piercing headaches, a claustrophobic feeling, heart palpitations. So, let's take a look. Where do you get the strength to help so many people and to be so calm despite all the persecution? Well, you know, when Aunt Olga was still alive, I only looked after her. But now I know that I have to do more than just be a doctor. Don't you think sometimes of emigration? I'm staying here. I want still to experience the new, better times. The Gestapo won't get me a second time. I could go to Aunt Lina, in Denmark, but after losing my career, to lose Hans as well, I couldn't bear it. To tear him away from his successes, I don't know if I'm capable of that. Ah, so that's the girl! Yes. I find her ravishing, enchanting. Better you don't find her so... Hmm. Look, though! Look! Cut! Thank you! Lights out! I have to hurry. I hope you'll be coming this evening to my première in the Artists' Theatre. Tomorrow we'll begin filming the scene with all the extras... Will we see you again for a bit later on? Perhaps in the KaDeWe Café? - Why, no! - But of course! You're invited too, didn't you know? - Typical case of directorial slip-up. - Agreed! Sulze! Come! Sulze, give me a nickel. - Wieland here. - Elisabeth? - Yes? I'll be home in about 20 minutes. I've got to change and then go to the première. Please be so good as to get my things ready. Yes, Hans, will you not be eating at home tonight? No, no... there's not enough time for that. But wouldn't you like to come along this time, dear? Even if you don't want to go to the theatre, still you could spend some time with us after the performance. - But Hans, such a proposal, you know it's not possible. - Why not? But, don't ask, you know that we need to avoid everything that could provoke. But child, you make me not want to go. I don't want to go without you. But you can't possibly skip it. Will Greta Koch be there as well? What? Uh, yes, I don't know... I assume so... I believe so... - Oh, dear, I've got to go, yes? - See you. Yes, Hans. I'll get everything ready. Dear friends, I'm living - but how! After the Nazis marched in I was arrested, but was able to escape. Could you spare some money? That would help me. Write about L. Your Kurt B. Heil Hitler! Donations for the front. - Hey, Mr. Zemansky, where are you? - Here. - So, there you go again. - No, there's something else. Housing questionnaire. Has to be turned in to me by tomorrow. Heil Hitler! Wieland here. No, wrong number. Mother tongue / National origins / Current citizenship status Which of the persons above is Jewish, according to the Reich Citizenship Laws - Hans? - Yes. Hello, my dear! I'm in a real hurry. I've got to change quickly. - Did you lay my things out? - Hans, Kurt Bernstein wrote a letter. We have to do everything we can for him. But this is appalling. Of course we'll send him what he needs. But you see? That's what happens to emigrants. To emigrants? Who knows how long we will be able to hold out? But Elisabeth, what's with these speeches? You know perfectly well, as long as I'm here, I will protect you. Protect? But it's like an avalanche that can't be stopped! I'm already dreaming about it. Last night I dreamt that I went into the street, and looked up at the sky and saw how a net was tightening and sinking ever lower. Oh, Elisabeth! Reality is hard enough, why should we torment ourselves with dreams? - A questionnaire just came... - Good, we'll fill it out tomorrow. And if you could just stay at home today, we really have to talk about everything. I don't know if it's right that we still have the flat. Shouldn't we take on a boarder, or move? But Elisabeth, don't be so nervous! Good, I'll see what I can do about getting away after the performance. Hans, that won't work. You've got to be there. And you'd like for once to be with cheerful, happy women? What's with these fantasies? Really, I'm doing what I can! Yes, you're doing what you can, but do you think that's enough for me? It's become clearer to me these last five married years, you just married me out of an overblown sense of decency! Not because you loved me, but because you felt it was your duty! And it's become ever clearer to me that you can't love me like you did that other man. Good evening, Hans. Where's your wife? - She stayed at home, as usual. - What a pity. You know, her old migraine, she doesn't feel well at all today. - I know something you don't know! - What, then? - We're to be partners in a new film! - Ah! Hans? You'll stay a bit? - I was just going myself... - But... Now we can finally get comfortable together! I admire your attitude, Hans. Really. Not everyone could do it. Always standing up for someone you love. - Water? - Thank you. How dangerously the two of you love... If you two could bridge this time of danger, would you do it? - What do you mean? - I mean, in Elisabeth's interest. Wouldn't it be better for her if she were to go to Switzerland? Hans, you don't have to pretend with me, you're torturing yourselves constantly. Let's leave my wife out of it. It's hard to bear, having to watch how such a gifted woman is no longer permitted to exercise a profession in which she is irreplaceable. How she's cast out and ostracised. And how our private life suffers from it. I am walled in too. I no longer have any contact with the people and with the life that I'm supposed to represent and give form to on stage. The profession is losing all its meaning. But the task of the actor is, after all to give shape to life as it really is. But what am I doing? I have to give shape to a life that no longer exists. I grope around in illusions, in memories, but everything's so ambivalent. And then the success that one has anyway, it's so empty, so... One acts a downright lie for the public, and one gets applauded for it. You could have an easier time of it, Hans Wieland. - You're making a sacrifice. - It's not about me. - My wife has it a lot worse. - That's all weighing on you as an artist. - Hans Wieland. - One can't even talk about it openly with anyone. - You're not really so alone. - Let's forget that for now. - Are you crazy? - No... Just a little tipsy... it's marvellous! Yes, I'm also marvellously drunk... wonderfully drunk. - What's going on? - It's OK... - No, no... They're breaking the Jews' windows! Help! Help! Help them! Don't you hear? They're beating people, beating them to death! - Move along... - Do your duty, man! I'm just with the watch. One of us had his teeth knocked out intervening. I said, the people in the Schillerstrasse are breaking windowpanes! Move along, I'm not gonna get involved! Go to the Goethestrasse, the Lieutenant says. Leave me in peace! I have a wife at home! I do too! That's just it! - Elisabeth! - Hans! Thank God you're there! You're OK! Hans, I have to get out of Germany. I know, you need your work, and your language. - But let me go. - Please, stay. You're not just my wife, you're my whole reason for living. Elisabeth, I need you. Please. I'll stay. Nothing's going to happen, Couldn't save anything at all... The fire was terrible... - Where is my child? - In the gymnasium! Look out! Light! Your death! Good morning! A penny for Winter Assistance! Thank you! Goodbye. Hello, Mrs. Schultz! Everything in one piece? I hear they were mostly in Spandau last night! Thank God, only a few of those things landed here. - Can I have two cardboard panels? - Certainly, you can take them right now. So, Mrs. Wieland, where have you been lately? I've had to load crates at Siemens. But this week I'm working the night shift. How can you endure such a schedule, Mrs. Wieland. 1 Mark 50. Millions of people have to do things now that they can't endure. But now I have to nail my flat shut, otherwise everything will be blow away. And then I have to go to the rationing office. Wednesday, October 25: Rationing stamps for mixed marriages. Saturday, October 28 for Jews Here? How is your husband doing, Mrs. Hallwig? He's been called up. To the East. I haven't heard from him in three months. Ladybird fly, your father's, in the war, your mother's... How's Mr. Wieland? I received a letter from him five days ago. He's been in the military hospital with typhus for some time now. Now he writes that he's to be discharged from the military. I'm very excited, he could come any day now. Here is England, here is England. Thousand-ton bombs dropped on targets in western Germany Stalin has broken through German lines. In Italy, heavy fighting near... The Russians... - Yes? - Won't you let me in? Kurt! How did you make it here? In this condition... You're hungry, quick, come to the kitchen. I've just finished cooking something. So, tell me what happened... Give me a cigarette. I was arrested in Vienna, and managed to escape. But you know that. I received your money, by the way. I wanted to go via Vorarlberg to Switzerland, but then they caught me again. I did time in Mauthausen for a few months then was supposed to be transferred to the Oranienburg concentration camp then I jumped from the moving train. I had this stuff on out of pity, some farmers gave me this suit. Actually, where's Hans? He's supposed to be discharged from the military, he could come any day now. Elizabeth, look, I apologise. - Why apologise? - Because I'm endangering you. But I have to hide somewhere nobody knows me. Could you give me the address of your Uncle Louis? He's certain to know people where I could go into hiding. You're the first one I'm telling this to, Kurt... Uncle Louis was supposed to be deported but they didn't catch him. He's living illegally with one of his patients. I'll give you the address. - Yes, good. - But we can do everything tomorrow. You've got to sleep, you're collapsing and you need an overcoat and to wash. I'll make the bed for you. I've got to make the night shift at 9:30 and then I'll be back early tomorrow morning. - Elisabeth... - Yes? Thank you, but I'd like to leave again quickly. It's so dangerous for you. But Kurt, that's unimportant now. No, thank you, Elisabeth, I know what I'm talking about. This morning I passed a former colleague at the train station. - Who? - Gallenkamp. - Did he recognise you? - I don't know, he didn't look at me. But of course, you'll stay here! You can't spend another night out in the open. Nobody's looking for you here! Heil Hitler, Herr Minister. You said it was pressing? Good, let's have it. It's, perhaps it doesn't belong here, in the Propaganda Ministry, I just thought because it's about a former actor. I just wanted your advice, in a conflict of conscience. - To be precise, it's about a non-Aryan. - Who? Don't speak so unclearly, and what do you want? This morning at the Friedrichstrasse train station I saw someone of whom it's been said that he'd been arrested in Vienna. He was acting like a fugitive, too. Well, what should I do now? Can I take the responsibility of denouncing a former colleague? - Naturally! What are you waiting for? - I'm not an informer! Nonsense! You must do your duty as a German. None of this humanity nonsense, please. What's the man's name? He used to work with us at the Artists' Theatre. Kurt Bernstein is his name. I don't know if you know him? Why the Devil are you coming to me with this? It's the Gestapo's business. It's not my responsibility. I just thought don't such things have to pass through the Theatre Department? Rubbish! And besides, why are you coming to me with this now? You should have had him arrested at the station this morning. He's probably long gone. Now there's no point in making a report. Yes, well, I just thought, if one wanted to look for him, I could easily imagine whom he might look up here in Berlin. He had certain friends here... who are themselves in special circumstances. Oh, stop it. What business is that of mine, in the Propaganda Ministry? Please contact the proper authorities. Do what you feel is your duty. God knows I have nothing to do with all this. The Nazis, with ingenious consistency, have repressed all the forces that could enlighten the people and bring it back from its fatal path. First, the Communists and the Social Democrats, the unions and the Freemasons, activists and all political parties. Then the Church, and the intellectuals. You were right, Kurt, back then, when you went off to Vienna. We believed that one should have confidence in the law and if you hadn't done anything bad, then nothing bad would be done to you. Oh, why didn't we see more clearly? Systematic murder: after the Jews, the mixed marriages after the mixed marriages, the so-called mixed breeds. And then everyone who doesn't want to go along with Hitler's insanity. Yes, now the catastrophe is approaching us, slowly but surely. Emigration is impossible. And to go into hiding, like you, or Uncle Louis. Hans is too well-known for that, and I am much too inept. Elisabeth, we have to persevere, but one day we'll be able to breathe freely again. - They're coming! - Hide yourself here! It's pointless, they'll find me here. - Is there no back exit? - No. But run up to the top floor, I'll try to keep them here. Maybe you can make your way to the street. - Yes? - Excuse me, Madam... an unpleasant affair you still know me, yes? Is a certain Bernstein with you? Bernstein? Do you mean the actor, Kurt Bernstein? He emigrated ten years ago to Vienna, no? You seem not to know that Bernstein is being looked for... Don't make speeches now! You say he's not here, let us in! House search. If you must. Please. I warn you! If the man appears, you must report immediately. Excuse me, Madam, I find this very embarrassing, but... There's no need for you to excuse yourself! Come. He... he went to work and hasn't been back for three days. I can't stand it any more either, this burden. Professor Bayer is also not back. Oh, God, I hope they won't do anything to you, What with the professor dying last week and the deportations are starting up again. Deportations? Yes, but not for the mixed marriages? - Yes, for them too. - What are you saying? - Deportations? - Yes. What do we have here? No stopping! I can't bear it all any more. But we didn't do anything to anybody?! I can't do it any longer. I no longer want to, either. I'm going to do it. Uncle Louis! Oh, dear Uncle Louis! You can rest easy, Bernstein is in good hands, with decent people, in the suburbs. He only asks for some money, if you have any extra. Uncle Louis, you've got to let the others down the stairs first. Don't let them get you! Don't worry about me, I'll find shelter. Oh, Uncle Louis, everything is so awful! Be brave, my child, it won't last much longer. All clear. Wednesday, November 26: rationing stamps for mixed marriages. - Where are all the others? - Don't you know, last week... The next eight should come in. - Name? - Hallwig. Nürnbergerstrasse 12. Two people. I see, your husband was killed in action, yes? - Yes. - Wait a moment. If you could do me a favour... the woman is Jewish. You know, Theresienstadt and so on. - Come along, please. - No, please, no... What do you want with mother? Quiet, don't do anything stupid, come along now! Let go of Mother! Don't scream so! If the husband is dead, then the wife is deported, certainly you're aware of that! Come on! Next! Next! Wieland. Next! Wieland Next! Hans! Hans! You're there! Hans! I waited for you so! I can't live without you any more! I'm dying of fear and longing... I was... but now you won't leave again! You'll stay! Better for both of us to die than to be parted once again! I'll stay with you always, dear Elisabeth. I've longed for you so! I've never before felt how much I love you. Now there's nothing that can part us! We'll stay together! - What's Uncle Louis up to? - He's gone into hiding. - Kurt Bernstein is with him. - Kurt? I thought he was in Vienna. No, he's here in Berlin. And he's gone into hiding. What will happen with you, Hans? Will you be able to act again? Fehrenbach's arranged it, I can act again! Oh, Hans... oh, my Hänschen! Now the sun will shine again... now I will love again! Now... this will all become a home again! Oh Hans... my Hänschen! You're hungry. Shall I make you something to eat? Gladly. - When are you going to see Fehrenbach? - Tomorrow at 11. By the way, if you'd like to see the film Melody tomorrow... Gladly. The film's supposed to have come out excellently. So... is there something else you want? Actually, yes. Pardon the mental leap, but we see each other so seldom. Please, out with it. You know, I've always advocated for you. I arranged it so that you got on the special list and were able to act and make films again. And I'm afraid I have to tell you I recently received a telephone call... Long story short, it's doubtful that you'll remain on the list if you stay married Dear Mr. Fehrenbach, some things are holier than the most beautiful vocation. Those include human dignity. One has to take me as I am or do without me. Well! What's going on here? But, dear child, no need to be startled! You've gone quite pale! Ah, you have no idea how afraid I am. Every strange tread on the stairs, the walls, which have ears the neighbours. Child! What are you doing here? I'm trying to put our flat back together again. Maybe one can forget the fear, if things here are as they used to be. Listen. Let me make you a proposition. Tomorrow, as an exception, you'll come with me to the première. Don't start up again with your many objections. Just once, one has to ignore all that, one has to regain one's strength and, above all, you need to be among people again. Listen, this is how we'll do it. We'll come at the last minute, stay quite alone in the box seats and drive home immediately afterwards. - Won't you do me the pleasure? - It's impossible, Hans. There could be people there who know me from before. I can't make such difficulties for you. And I don't know how to be among people any more. I'm no longer used to going places where happy people come together. I know how well you mean it with me and your proposal is wonderful, but completely dumb and completely impossible. Hans Wieland! Hans Wieland! Herr Wieland, you absolutely must come onstage for a moment! - No, no, I... - No, off you go, and come right back. What a surprise! You here, Madam? May I ask you to convey to Herr Wieland my heartfelt congratulations on this film. Please introduce me to this charming woman, Herr Minister! I didn't know that Herr Wieland had such an enchanting wife! Well, this film... that is to say... very powerful! That's art! Is Madam an actress as well? Wonderful thing, film. Eclectic! Interesting! Always something new! Excuse me, Herr State Secretary, one moment, please. Does it have to be right now? Don't I have a moment? My apologies, Madam, you see. Well, once again, my regards. Alas, I must also... - Have my car brought up. - Yes, right away, Herr State Secretary! Well? What is it? Hans, my Hänschen! What a day! I'm so happy! It was such a beautiful film! Finally, to be at a première again! How good it was that you convinced me to come! That will hold me for a long time! What are you saying? A Jew? That is un... Well, I'll say... This will have to be reported! It's the height of insolence and tactlessness on your part that at a public event you introduced me to a Jew! Let me explain... The special permission for Herr Wieland is of course revoked. And you, Dr. Blohm, have been consorting with Jews for years. - You will have to bear the consequences. - But, Herr State Secretary... I've already explained to you how it all happened! If it's all really as accidental as you claim, you will naturally have to bear the consequences. I demand that you report the couple now, in my presence, to the Gestapo. - Shouldn't I do it properly, in writing? - No! I must report tomorrow to the Minister that the situation is taken care of. Connect me with the State Police, Albrechtstrasse. Propaganda Ministry. I'm connecting you with Herr Minister Dr. Blohm. You ordered Herr Wieland here. You may go in. Take a seat, Herr Wieland. I have very unpleasant things to tell you. And I don't want to beat around the bush, but say just say what I have to say to you. You know that I've tried all these years to protect you and your wife. But because your wife appeared in public, for which I'm being held responsible, I am compromised to such a degree that I could no longer prevent your removal from the special list. You won't let me perform any more? Stage ban. Well, then... Stop! Sit down. I have something else to tell you. Please understand that it's terrible for me to have to communicate what I must say to you now. For your wife, nothing more can be done She can no longer be deferred from deportation. Listen, Wieland, the situation is awful, for you as much as for me. But we have to see how we can get out of this mess. - Get out? - Yes! I mean your personal safety, Herr Wieland. What do you mean? I'd like us to think about how we can get you out of this mess! I want to prove to you that I am still well disposed to you. I want to intervene for you personally provided you immediately put your divorce officially on record. Tell me, don't you feel shame any longer, making me a proposal like that? What are you saying? Ten years ago, you explained that you were joining the Party in order to prevent injustices and crimes. What crimes have you prevented since then? Herr Wieland! Don't forget that I've protected you and several others for years! That's supposed to be your justification? That you've helped two or three people for a while? Herr Dr. Blohm! One day, hundreds of artists from whom you, with your race politics, have taken everything will indict you, you personally, Herr Dr. Blohm. Tell me yourself, what can I do, as a single individual, as a civil servant? But it's also our fault that this is happening to us, we never bothered with politics, we believed it would never get so bad, that as individuals, as artists, we could disavow responsibility. - We're just as guilty as you are. - How can you say such a thing? You stand there now as a tool of the worst sort of crimes. And to people who once were close to you, you are becoming a murderer. I forbid you to speak to me this way! Don't forget that I stand before you as... as your superior! As what? As my superior? No need to press your buzzers, no fear, I won't dirty my hands. One more word and I'll have you arrested! Yes, Herr Minister! I have done everything that was required. The case will be settled tomorrow morning. Hans! You darling, good man! You were really right! I'm feeling so revived, so happy! Let's have a lovely evening together. You're so cheerful. Come, look at the pictures. I took everything out again. It was such a beautiful time. I looked at my old parts again, too. Hans, I'd like to play Louise once more, or Joan of Arc or a really small part like Büchner's Lucile. Do you remember? 'Come! Come, Camille! Quietly up the stairs! They're all asleep. The moon has been helping me wait. You're so still... Why don't you say anything? Listen, people say, "You must die now" and make such serious faces. "Die" what sort of a word is that? Say it to me, Camille. "Die" I want to think about that. Yes, that's it. Come, sweet friend, help me catch it! Come! Come!' Dearest Hans... This is to be a libation of thanks to the fate that brought you back here. The whole ordeal of the last few years was not in vain. - For we are together again. - And we will remain together always. Hans, you promised me once, remember, in that terrible night when the shop windows were smashed in and yet you were drafted, and we were separated for years. Promise me, that they will never ever separate us again. I promise you that. Do you remember Love and Intrigue? But you're tired and strained, Hans. Look, I have a surprise for you. We'll make ourselves a good strong cup of coffee. It's already ground, and the water is on the stove. Keep on playing, Elisabeth. I'll make it. You did right. Today I see for the first time how beautiful our marriage was. The persecution, the fear, the pain, all brought us closer together than any two people have ever been. The little tiffs were unimportant. Ach, Hans, I'm happy with you. 'Do you see the rainbow in the air? The heavens open their golden gates. What's happening to me? Light clouds raise me up. The heavy armour becomes a flowing gown. Upwards Upwards The Earth flies away. The pain is short. And the joy is eternal.' Hans, I'm getting so sleepy. I believe, I rejoiced too much. I thank you for that as well. - You know? - Yes. This film is dedicated to the memory of the actor Joachim Gottschalk who was driven into death with his family in the fall of 1941 and with him to all those who fell as victims.
