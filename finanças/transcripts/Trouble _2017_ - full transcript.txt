These are perennial. That means they come back every year. You don't have to replant them or anything, they just come back. - Every year? - Every year. Forever. These were your mother's favorite, peonies. She liked how fluffy they are. Pretty fluffy for a flower. Yeah. Here. Come on. That's good, Maggie. Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it. Trying to get yourself killed? What are you doing here? Get out of my way. Get out of my way! You're not allowed to do this! You don't get out of the way, I'm gonna run you over. All right, so get out of the way. Go. He almost ran over me. - With a backhoe? - Twice. - How did he get it up there? - Who cares? Just trying to get the facts here, Maggie. Did you see him drive it up there? He took it up the logging road. How did he look? I guess he looked pretty good for an asshole digging a hole on my property. - He looked just fine. - Okay. I want you to arrest him. Come on, Maggie. Don't make excuses for him. I'm not making excuses. He's definitely a knucklehead. Yeah, he's a knucklehead, with a backhoe, digging a huge hole in my property. Okay, let's go and take a look at this. Man, is he good with that thing. It's kind of little for a backhoe, isn't it? Uh-oh, look at this. Who's that? Ben's sister. God damn it, there are more of them. He brought friends. Let me take care of this. Maggie... - Get off of my property. - Ben. Ben Farmer. Ben Farmer. Hey, Maggie. God damn it, Gerry. Man, what are you doing here? Well, Ben called me. He said the two of you were... Yeah, don't tell me about it. I don't want to know. You two, out, out. I thought they worked this out. Well, I guess not. You, get off my land. We got a bit of a situation here, Ben. Logan, I don't see how this is any of your business. It's his business because you're breaking the law, you asshole. You clearly don't understand everything, as usual. This is my land, Logan. - Oh, for fuck's sake, it is not. - My land. You were never meant to have the whole place. For one thing, you aren't keeping it up. - Her husband died, the whole place... - You leave him out of it. Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, he robbed me, she robbed me, both of them robbed me. - Now, it's mine. - Bullshit. You came to that office, to that lawyer's office, and I said, "If we give you - "a good price for that land... - Maggie. "...you can't come back here in 20 years." - Oh, good Christ, you fucked me. - She is something. - Okay. - She is so crazy. - Okay, listen. - It might interest you to know, Logan, that I acquired this land legally, two weeks ago. "Acquired this land." Who did you acquire it from? - Because I didn't sell it to you. - Oh, didn't you? - No. - Okay, you're claiming... No, not claiming. No, I have the permits. I have everything in the truck. That's bullshit! Bullshit! Hey, Ben. We gonna go back to work? - No, you're going home. - Oh, round two. - Now she's gonna harass my workers? - Ben. Ben. - I got the papers, okay. - I don't know what they told you, and I don't care, but I'm telling you, as the owner of this property, that you are violating my rights. And if you don't leave now, immediately, I'm going to... You will be arrested and charged. - It's not funny, Gerry. - It... It is kind of funny, Maggie. No, it's not. You look good. You're gonna have to let me take care of this, Maggie. You're not taking care of anything. There's a huge hole right there. Go on. Get in the truck. You want me to get in the truck? Yes, I want you to get in the truck. You can't tell me to get in the truck! I am telling you to get in the truck. Come on. Come on. She's fucked. She's out of her mind. Because I have the permit. Maggie, I'm gonna need you to go on home. I'll call you when I have more of a handle on this. Go on. Hi, this is Maggie Kramer. I was just wondering if you got that idiot, otherwise known as my brother, off my property. This is a serious matter, and, frankly, I hope you arrested that fucking son of a bitch. That was stupid. Hi, Mrs. Kramer. This is Elise. It's Maggie Kramer. She also left you two messages on your voicemail. I am not in yet. He's not in yet, Mrs. Kramer. Can I take a message? And I'm sure he will as soon as he gets in. - What's that about? - Ben Farmer, making trouble again. Who knows what he's up to? It'll take me a few days to sort it out. Ben, you up? Yeah, I'm up. I brought you coffee. Lord. Yeah. Oh, he's, uh... He's staying out here now? Your kid? - Is that a problem? - No. I didn't know whether you needed me today or not. Absolutely. You work things out with Maggie? What did I say? Look, I can't, um... I can't get in the middle of something between you two, all right? Before, when I asked, you said... No. You said that she was fine. And yesterday, she was clearly not fine. This is not your concern, because I'm handling it. It is my concern. Look, I... I gotta return the backhoe if it's not a legal site. You're still pining for her, is that it? Okay. No, please. I saw you when she pulled up. You about fell over. - You're crazy. - "I love you. I love you, Maggie. - "It doesn't matter... - Oh, shut up. "...that you tossed me aside for Tom Kramer." Oh, you asshole. You asshole. I'm the asshole. Fuck. What's up with him? Who knows? Hey, listen. I can't go up to the, uh, site with you today. Come on! No, I only have the backhoe for one week. I've got this parole thing. You know, might go to the Y, and take a shower. Whatever. God! What's this? You get off my land now. Put that down. You get off my land right now, or I'm gonna shoot you. I said put that thing down before you hurt somebody. Crazy bitch. Ow! You shot me. I said I was going to. You're not allowed to just shoot people. You're not allowed to do a lot of the things that you do, - but you do them anyway. - It hurts. Stomping on my garden. I can't believe you did that. I can't believe you. I'm calling the cops. Oh, good luck with that. I called them. They didn't do a fucking thing. And you know what? They don't like you. You know what that useless sheriff calls you behind your back? He calls you a knucklehead. No, I'm telling you, you are fucked. You are really fucked this time. I'm standing here with a gun, and you're telling me stuff? I'm telling you... Asking you, asking. Don't shoot me again, okay. Don't kill me. That's better. God damn. Aren't you gonna help me? Hey! I got somebody here who needs some attention. There was an accident with a shotgun. You... You put him in the back of the truck? He's all right. I'm not all right. She shot me. - No... - Can I get some help over here? I can walk here, I can walk. - Clear that way, please. - I can walk. It's that one! She shot me! With a gun. What a baby. Your lawyer's here. I didn't call him. I did. You can't sit here all day. I didn't ask you to arrest me. Hey, you gonna let me out? Are you gonna shoot anybody else? Why would I? Oh, boy. My car is right there, yeah. So Logan said Ben had some crazy story. He's always got some crazy story. What's new? You sold him back his half? He didn't have half of the land. Tom and I paid for that land upfront. Ben was only interested in the money. He needed the money. Stop. Whose side are you on, anyway? I'm not... I'm not taking sides. You're my lawyer. You're supposed to take sides. You're supposed to take my side. I just... Mmm, I just wondered if you knew why he would say that. 'Cause he's a fucking lunatic, that's why. Okay. Listen, I shot my brother. It was about time somebody did it. Everybody in this town has wanted to shoot him at one point or another. There's no question about that. They should give me a fucking prize. Ben. Come on, Benny. So, soon as I light it, run. I'm afraid. I'm not. Go. Go. Hey. Yeah, hey. I'm glad you called. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just need a ride, that's all. Yeah. I was over at Williams' this morning, and I heard that you got arrested. It's totally ridiculous. Well, I heard that you shot Ben. He was invading my property, and, yes, I did shoot him, and I should've shot him worse. And what you were doing hanging out with him, I don't even want to know. All right, look. He told me that he worked this out with you, okay. And Tom's been gone a year now, so I thought maybe you had decided... No, I decided nothing, and you thought wrong. - Thanks for the ride. Appreciate it. - You're welcome. He's not here anymore. Well, where did he go? It says he signed himself out. But he's not dead? Yeah, it says he walked out on his own steam. After that, I don't know. Whoo! Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't be just staying out here in the trailer. It's my land. It's Maggie's land, Ben. Isn't that the problem? She's in big trouble. My point being is maybe you should stay a few days with Gerry. - Huh? - He's got central heating. I got heating. That propane tank's so old, it's gonna explode the next time you even look at it. God damn it. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You want to smoke some weed? Yeah. - Hey, Gerry. - What's cooking, Gerry? - Hey. - Yeah, he's in there. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's me. Oh. Good. Yeah. Heard you got shot. - Okay? - It's nothing. Told you you should've waited. I had the backhoe. Talk to him, he's all, "You only have it for one week." - That's all I could get it for. - Yeah, whatever. Maggie shot you. She really did. She's a piece of work. You all know that she stole that land from me. My father left me half the property. At the first Sign of trouble that I get into, it doesn't matter what it was. She doesn't say, "Hey, let's give Ben a little time to work this out. "He's in trouble. He's my brother. "He deserves kindness." That asshole that she got married to, I mean, he was in on it, too. I mean, the two of them tried to rob me of my inheritance. God damn, no, no. I mean, the time has finally come for me to say, "No, no. "NO." Wow. She really got you. That's what I'm saying. Jeez! I told my wife Ben's sister tried to kill him. She says, "About time somebody did." She said that? Yeah. And then the kids started up... Yeah, the wife didn't like that. But they got to learn sometime, those kids. You know women. They don't like shooting. Well, maybe Maggie, I guess, but... Lord, lwish I'd been there to see that. - Me, too. - Easy now. Hey, hey. Yeah, well, I mean, it would've been something. Hey, can you give me a little of that? You just came from the hospital. I thought they'd give you some Vicodin - or some Percocet or something. - Give me. No, they told me if I checked myself out, I was on my own. Let me just write that. Sheriff, Mrs. Kramer's here to see you. Maggie, how you doing today? Shoot anybody? There hasn't really been a need to, yet. How can I help you? I want you to drop those charges against me. That's a matter for the courts. I barely even winged Ben. He up and walked out of the hospital this morning. You can explain that to your lawyer. You drop your charges, and I'll drop mine. Your charges? I am bringing charges of criminal trespass and destruction of property against my brother. Shouldn't she be writing this down? Elise, if Maggie wants to bring charges, what does she need to do? She needs to talk to her lawyer. Are you kidding? What was I supposed to do? He was digging a huge hole on my property. You didn't do a thing. Maggie, he had the permits. And how did he get them? Did you look into that? No. Some sheriff. You should arrest yourself. Hey, Rachel. Sheriff, what can I do for you? I'm here to look at some land grants. Okay. Which ones? Well, just one, actually. The Farmer property. Hmm. I don't... That's not how things are filed around here. You don't happen to remember a lot number? A lot number? Things are filed... They're not filed according to names. You don't remember the lot number? Well, you know where it is. It's right up there at the end of the hollow. Mmm, which one is it? Look, I've got these building permits that you approved of for Ben Farmer just this week. You know what lot it is. Oh. That's the property you're talking about. Sure. Are you okay? Yeah, I just never did it this way before. Could you excuse me for a second? I just remembered I have to make a phone call. Have a seat. You're just trying to get me to calm down, and the problem with that is that you don't actually let me, like, talk through what I'm actually feeling. And more important than that, like, it just upsets me even more, because you're not hearing what actually happened today. And what actually happened, like, the facts, are that the Sheriff came into my place of work, and was asking for documents that I didn't want to give him. He was being really, really nice about it, like, the kind of nice that's, like, you know that you're screwed. - What did he say? - He made me show him everything. Everything about that piece of land that you... "Everything." What do you mean by "everything"? You told me that this was legal. You need any help? No, we don't. - We're good. - He meant a drink. I'll have a white wine Spritzer, please. I'll have a beer, whatever you got on tap. Thank you very much. Thank you. Everything that we're doing is legal. Oh, my God. I gave you those permits because you told me you had logging rights. - And... - We do. No, and you also told me that Ben was gonna buy the land back because she was behind on her taxes. - You told me that. - Yes. She's like $50,000 behind. Why couldn't you just wait? Gerry had the backhoe. Do you... Do you understand that without the underlying documents, the permits are illegal? They are. And why did you show them to the Sheriff? Hey, look, did he say you're under arrest? Did he say you're going to jail? Mmm... No. Did he say you're going to hell? Curt, you told me that I was not gonna get in trouble. You're not in trouble. You promise? I'm hungry. Well, let's see. I've got some cheese and crackers, some summer sausage, there's tomatoes, I think. Uh, there's peaches I got at the farm stand, there's some corn somewhere, hamburger in the fridge and noodles in the closet. Oh. You're shitting me, aren't you? I think there's some peanuts somewhere. Hey, Curt, what took you so long? We're starving up here. You bring any food? Some shit going on. Yeah, what kind of shit? Some "we got a problem" shit. The Sheriff's gonna make trouble. The Sheriff, the short guy? Yeah. The Sheriff's stirring up shit. Hey, tell me later. Gerry. Where are the peanuts? Peanuts? - I'll get them. - Oh, no. In the... No, peanuts and the summer sausage. Don't forget the noodles. So, you told the Sheriff. I didn't tell him anything. Look, just so you know, you're not in trouble. She's the one who's in trouble, all right? She shot me. There's no getting around that, right. I'm wounded. She's in big fucking trouble. And the boom is coming down on my sister. Okay. Yes. But there are other people looking into this situation right now. But this is what I'm saying. You don't have to worry about it, right. You don't have to talk about it with anybody, all right. - Well... - This is all on her. It's... She has been caught in a web of her own making. It took years. It took time, a lot of years of planning and execution. It's only her malfeasance and ingratitude and disloyalty that have brought her to this point. And it is nothing that we did. It's just the poisonous defects of her own disappointing character. Hey, Ben. Maggie. Didn't bring your shotgun, I see. You want, I can go get it. That won't be necessary. We were just on our way out. Can I thank you very much for your help? We'll be in touch. What were you telling them? What? Did you not understand my question? I don't... I don't even know who you are. No, you don't know who I am at all. And you're letting those criminals steal my house. Mrs. Kramer, you are very behind on your taxes. What's that to you? It is a fact. And if you lose your land, it is not my doing. You're letting them turn you into the kind of person who can destroy another person's life without even thinking twice about it. I don't... - My boyfriend says... - Your boyfriend? Dream bigger, would you? If you can't dream bigger now, you think it's ever gonna get any better? You're crazy. Yeah. Makes you feel better when you tell yourself that. But guess what. You're not the first person who's tried it on me. Hang on. Hang on. It's really deep. It's super-duper deep. On. Come on, bud. Ben, Ben. Go, go. Come on, Gerry. Hi. Hello. Is Curt around? Do you see him anywhere? You know, you don't actually own that land yet. That's my land. My father left me that land. And then you sold it to your Sister and her husband. I read the records. They stole it, you mean. You sold it to them. It's a manner of speech. Don't you understand anything? I mean, yeah, I signed some papers, and they gave me some money, but it wasn't anywhere near enough. That's what "They stole it" means. I don't think it means that. Did I invite you here? I'm waiting for Curt. Is he coming back? He's doing some business. Hey. You know that kid that makes coffee at Gypsy Donuts? No, I don't think I know him. He's got crazy hair. Blue. I don't know anyone at Gypsy Donuts. Well, you don't have to know him personally. I don't go into Gypsy Donuts, so I don't think I know him. Well, he's got a great pot connection. Curt can meet you there. Maggie's gonna default on her taxes again. When she does, the state's gonna auction that property off. When they do, whoever holds the logging rights gets to be first in line to buy it. Hmm. So, what I need from you is those logging rights. Well, I need $5,000. Let me borrow them for one week. - Shit. - What? Maggie's here. All right, just go. Hustle, man. Be quiet. "Be quiet," man. I'm sure... Shut up. You're making all the noise telling me to be quiet. Yeah. Hey, Maggie, how you doing? - I'm okay. - Good. You look good. You looking to let go of more of those logging rights? - No. - No? What I was wondering is, can I have a look at those leases I already sold to you? What do you want to look at those for? I want to see how much I owe. Might buy them back. Your people aren't using them, and you never do any logging up there. I can't. Why not? Because... Oh, for heaven's sake. Wait, you can't go in there. Now, this is private property. - So what? - Maggie, come on now. I'm gonna call the police now. Oh, you do that. I hope it works better for you than it worked for me. What's going on here? Nothing's going on. Look, you're trespassing, okay? And if you want to see the files, you're gonna need a warrant. - A warrant? - You know what I mean. Just call and make an appointment. Bring your lawyer with you. You can't just go barging in to private property. That's not what people do. Go! Hmm. Here you go. Good to see you again. Can I help you? Oh. L, uh... Are you Jimmy? Sorry, no. His shift doesn't start for another 20 minutes. Is there anything I can do for you? No, I'll come back. Should I tell him that you stopped by? No, no. No, that's okay. Oh, you're here to score some weed, aren't you? - Hey, Rachel. - Rachel. Whoa! Hi, Elise. - Hello. - Getting a cup of coffee? No. Yes. Yes. Except my wallet... I think I left it... Hey, hey. What are you running away for? I'm not running away. You're pretty speedy. So? You didn't get your coffee, did you? I don't really need coffee. No one needs coffee. It's not really all that good for you. That's exactly what I was gonna say. It's not that good for you, so it's not like I should just have coffee whenever I feel like it. Well, not whenever you feel like it. - No. - But it's delicious. I think it's delicious. Oh, no. No, no, no. You could get tea, like herbal tea. I don't want tea. A glass of water? Hey. Do you want a bacon donut? No, I don't... No, just a coffee, Elise. I got to go. Well, maybe tomorrow we could... I tried to do it, Curt, but the Sheriff is here... It's all right. I got it from here. Wow. Look at his arms. Honestly, I don't really know how this is gonna work. What are you talking about? You're gonna be great. Rachel. Mrs. Farr. How are you doing, honey? Good, good. I just came to say hello. And to do some banking. So, let me hear about what kind of banking you think you might want to do today. Well, I need... I guess I need a loan. What kind of loan, honey? Well, it's for... It's for my mom, actually. Is she okay? Yeah, she's just struggling a little bit, and I'd love to help her out any way that I could. You know, pay her back for college. I was thinking maybe $10,000 or something. Well, I can get the paperwork going on that, sure, but, honey, I can't imagine what you have to use as collateral. Oh. Well, I have this. - Logging rights? - Mmm-hmm. So, Ben, you're gonna do some logging now. Yeah. You have a problem with that? No, no, I think it's a good idea. Good. And we're cool, right? We're always cool, Ben. You just got to pay for what you're buying. Sending that kid to steal the papenNork, that's not right. He didn't send me. I didn't steal it. I borrowed it. So, you used the logging rights to borrow the money to buy them. No, actually, no, they didn't go for that, so we used my car as collateral. Mrs. Farr knows my mom from way back and that seemed to make the most sense. You put your car up? What can I say? My woman loves me. She's incredible. Look at the horse. Wow, man, that pretty horse... I like their garden. Yeah, they look pretty good. Look at that. - It's good. - Little stream there. Mmm-hmm. That's nice. Look at her. Hey, they look like the, urn... Those look like the flowers Dad was talking about, you know. Oh, yeah, the fluffy ones. Yeah, the fluffy ones. I forgot what they were called. - Look at the horse. - Wow. Look, there's Snow White, I think. Maybe that could be Rose Red. Mmm. Yeah. Look at, like, the woods behind... Oh, yeah, that... Uh-huh. I mean, the forest looks a tiny bit creepy. You know, one of those... Yeah. I thought I told you to get off my land. You know what, Maggie? You're not allowed to tell me where I'm allowed to be. On my property, I am. I see you lost your backhoe. I see you lost your mind. And you're probably just gonna leave it like this, aren't you? Just a big hole in the earth. Come back here, you dig a big, ugly, black hole, then you take off again. That's what you do. You wish. I wish you'd leave me alone is what I wish. I'm not gonna just dig a hole here. I'm gonna build a house here. I'm gonna live here. Not on my land you're not. Why not? What do you care? Hmm? You don't use it anyway. Tom is dead and you're alone. You leave Tom out of this. You're alone, and he's not around to protect you from your own misdeeds. "Misdeeds." That's hilarious. You left. Oh, for the love of God. People leave and then they come back. Yeah, they come back after their father's dead. He died calling your name. "Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie?" - Don't say that to me. - "Where's my Maggie?" - Don't say that to me. - Why not? It's true. You never told me how sick he was, and that's on you, how you let him die. His room was a pigsty. There was garbage all over the floor. I was alone with a dying man. And you don't get to tell me that I didn't do the dishes enough. You know what? When you're this close, I can smell you. When was the last time you took a bath? You smell like some kind of dead animal in the woods. You don't like it, you can leave. Nobody wants you here anyway. It's my land. Not for long. This is hard. So, we bury this and in 50 years, we dig it up. It's a time capsule. But what if we forget where we put it? We won't forget. Gerry, do you have something you want to put in? Here. - What's this? - It's a heart. - Can I put a heart in, too? - Do you have one? Now, we bury it. Hey. Hello, Gerry. Do you mind if I join you? Sure, come on up. Two chairs set up all nice like this. Looks like you were expecting me. That was Tom's chair. Oh, I'm sorry. That's... That's okay. He's been dead almost a year. Oh, I know. I just thought, well, maybe you didn't want anybody sitting in his chair. Well, we used to sit out here every night, you know, have a cocktail. Talk about the day, the weather. Hmm. One time, we saw a bear... Come up to that tree. Mmm. A bear. That was something. Big black one. Oh. Um... These are for you. Yeah, I wanted to, uh... To come by and just say hi, couple of times. But I didn't know... What didn't you know? You know, everybody was saying that you were missing Tom, and I didn't want to intrude. You want to come in, have a cocktail? - I do. - Okay, come on. - You want a bourbon? - Bourbon would be great. - Ice cube? - lce cube. Sure. The place looks great. Ben came over and tromped the whole thing to the ground. - What? - You seen him lately? Couple of times, sure. He just wants to come home. He wants to steal home, you mean. Well, he's surely stealing things. Or actually, Curtis. They grabbed up your logging rights. It may not be such a bad idea. I mean, hejust wants to do some logging, cut down a few trees. It'll keep him out of trouble. Are you kidding? Ben doesn't wanna go back to work cutting down trees. Now that he's got my logging rights, he's going to... He's gonna grab the land because of the taxes. - No. - Yes. - Uh-uh. - Yeah. Yeah. That's the plan. That's the whole thing. They're gonna steal my property, and then, they're gonna kick me to the... Ah. And who knows even what they're gonna do with me. They're probably gonna put me in some nursing home with no windows, and terrible nurses who tie you to the bed. - No. - Yes. No, I'm sure they're not gonna do that. Yes. And you know who's cooked this up? That kid he's running around with. Lord, that kid is the devil. Who is that kid anyway? You don't know who he is? No, who is he? He's Ben's son. Rosa, Rosa Ramirez. Wicked and wild. It was 1995, Rosa. She was the one, I'm telling you. The one that got away. Wait a minute, hey. Gerry, is that you? What's up, Gerry? You got some groceries for us? What's this? Oh, wait a minute. What... Great. You piece of shit. Gerry, you bring her here? Yeah. You know, you guys, she has a right to know. - You told her? - He told me. He told me that this is your son. This shit-for-brains is my nephew. Wait, this is what you're mad about now? I'm mad about so many different things, you can't count that high. Get off my land. You get off my land. You sold it to me. Get with the program. You can't sell land. Yes, you can, because you did. No, you can't. - Oh. Hey, hey. - Oh, please. - What is this? - Calm down. - Hey, hey, hey. - Yeah, or what? - Come on now, Ben. - She can shoot at me but I can't shoot at her? - No, you can't. Put the gun down. - I'm serious. Put... Whoa. - Oh, Lord. - Ben? - Oh, Lord. - Ben, you okay? Ben? Come here. What are you so worried about him? - Ben? - I'm the one he shot at. - He's not breathing right. - Talk to me, Ben. - Ben. - Let's get you on your feet. Come on. You can't hold him that tight. He can't breathe. You okay, Ben? Ben, you okay? Yes, he's okay. I got him. - Get out of the way. - Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. You get out of the way! You're the one who shot him! - That was days ago. - So? So, he's been getting stoned in the woods ever since. You think that's good for him? - We need a doctor! - We need a doctor! Look, marijuana's medicinal. You're an idiot. Not again. Somebody help me here. Oh, my God, it's... We need a gurney. Wasn't this guy, like, just here? Get a gurney, now. I'm back. I can see that. Stay still. - Did you see... Did you... - He just fell down. - Ma'am... - Take his... - Get out of here. - Against the wall, please. Thank you. Doctor. Maggie Farmer? That's me. Your brother is very sick. When he was shot, the bullet perforated the bottom lobe of the left lung. It had really not begun to heal properly when he checked himself out. It's been gathering fluid. He's developed pneumonia, and the lung collapsed. We have him on a respirator, but it's very bad. "Very bad." What does that mean? It's touch and go. I'm sorry. Can I see him? You're the one who shot him Ms. Farmer, so, no. I'm not letting you up there. I'm his son. You can go in. He's in intensive care, room 1422. Uh, I'm his friend. Can I go up? Yeah. Go. "Snow White was more quiet and gentle than Rose Red. "Rose Red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields, "seeking flowers, and catching butterflies. "But Snow White sat at home with her mother, "and helped her with her housework, "or read to her when there was nothing to do." I'm sorry I shot you. I'm sorry I shot you, Benny. I'm sorry. Oh. Hello. You the lawyer? - Samuelson? - Uh... I'm sor... I'm sorry, do I know you? I'm Ben Farmer's son. Oh, yes. Yes, I heard. That's... Come, come, come. How is Ben? He's bad. Oh. I heard he was doing better. He's not still in the hospital? Very much still in the hospital. I think he's gonna die. I'm sorry to hear it. That doesn't do anybody any good. Well... My assistant's not in yet. I'd offer you coffee, or condolences... Look, I got to say this, 'cause I have to be on top of this now. If Ben dies, it's because his sister shot him. So, what's the question? I'm his only living heir, right? I mean, she can't shoot him and then inherit all that land. - That doesn't make any sense. - Okay. Come. Uh, sit down. First things first. Does Ben have a will? Does that matter? If he has a will, of course, his worldly possessions will be distributed accordingly. If he doesn't have one, everything goes to the next of kin. Okay. Right. Is that me or his sister? Well, you were right a moment ago. If he dies from a gunshot wound which she inflicted, the law nullifies her claim. Does he have any other offspring? No. No. So, what if he doesn't die? Oh. Well, then no one inherits anything. Damn it, Ben! Where did you put it? There's shit all over our fucking place, and not a goddamn worthwhile fucking thing in his fucking life. Fucker! Hey. Hi. - How you doing? - Well... How do you think I'm doing? Oh, I just, um... I just came to get your father's blanket. - There. - Okay. What is that? It's a blanket. I thought he might want it. No, what kind of animal is that? Um... I don't think it's an animal. I think he got it from Walmart. All right. You looking for something? I just gotta... You know, Ben worked so hard to get those documents to prove that he is entitled to this property that she stole from him. Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Well, it don't matter if it's more complicated than that. Right? Those logging rights say that he's entitled to this land, and if he dies, then we got to have that piece of paper. I got it. Say what now? You said you got it? Well, I just, um... I just thought that someone should take care of it. This... All right. Thank you. Hey, Gerry. You don't happen to know if Ben had a will, do you? You mean, if he has a will? Yeah, that's what I mean. Well, Ben doesn't think much of documents. They don't make sense to him, so... I'd be surprised. Thank you. Ma'am. Maggie? - Ms. Farmer. - Hmm. They're turning off the machines. No. No, God, no. No, no, no, he's gonna be fine. It's fine. No. Oh, no, his blood oxygen levels are great. That's why they're turning the machines off. No. Oh, he's fine. Dr. Adunbi just came in and checked him. He's gonna be okay? Well, yes, he's fine, but you shouldn't go Shooting him again. I won't. Aww. For now, I think you should wait outside. He's likely to be nauseous from the sedative for a little while. What is the matter with you? - You don't tell them like that. - She scares me. You want pancakes, hash browns, breakfast scramble, vegetarian breakfast scramble, sausage, French toast sticks? - Um, pancakes. - You just want pancakes? Maybe some eggs. Breakfast scramble or vegetarian breakfast scramble? L, uh... Uh, that stuff there without the... - Breakfast scramble. - We'll both have that. You want hash browns or French toast sticks? French toast sticks. I want pancakes. Not here you don't. How long's he been living up there? A while. I told him that he could use my extra room, but he said he liked the trailer. We used to spend a lot of time up there with my dad. Mmm-hmm. I remember. Maggie. He came through. That's good. Yeah. Ishould'vejust let him build that house. Why didn't you? It was Tom's money. It was all the money he had. It was the only way we could keep the place together. Ben would've sold it to somebody awful. They were gonna strip the mountain, he said. Just about ruined us paying Ben all that money. And now I think he's gonna come after me again. I just don't know how to stop it. Well... Can I help you? I'm his son. Are you? Oh, well, I have good news. You do? We took the respirator out. Oh, he's gonna be just fine. Of course, you don't want anybody else taking aim at him. No, ma'am. I'm getting multiple complaints from patients. What's going on? Talk to me. You know, I got stuff going on. Come on. Just come on, just come on... What on Earth do you think you're doing? Just trying to make him more comfortable with his pillow. You were not trying to make him more comfortable. Well, now he's not more comfortable, because you're in here yelling. You were trying to suffocate him. You were trying to kill your own father. I'm not the one who shot him. Oh, that takes the cake. How does it feel, Ben? How does it feel to have your own son try to kill you? That's not what I'm doing. What's going on in here? Who turned this off? Good. Somebody. About time. I was just about to come find somebody out there to see is this thing supposed to be on, is it supposed to be off, because this is my father laying there, you understand me? Doesn't matter to you. It's not your father laying in the bed, - so it don't matter, right? - What are you talking about? You're gonna kill him, and I can't stand by for that. - So let's get some... - Come on, we got to go. - Fine. - We got to go. Whatever this is, please take it downstairs. People are really sick here. Yeah, they certainly are. You're coming with me. Did you think you were gonna inherit? Is that what you were after? Inheriting my land? It's not your land. That's not a "no." God, you're a Farmer, all right. We're an evil tribe. That's illegal. You're not the boss of me. I Should take you down to the Sheriff and turn you in right now. You can't prove I did anything. I was an eyewitness. So, it's my word against yours. You gonna try it again? Are you? When's the last time you ate any real food? I eat. Oh, sure you do. So, you're his kid, huh? Yeah. Right. That's right. That makes me your aunt. I just think they could've told me, is all. He didn't know. He didn't know? We were in Maine. My mom, me and my dad. Er... The guy I thought was my dad. And then, uh, when I was, I don't know, maybe 10 years old, she told him that lwasn't his, and... So he left. He left? Yeah, lwasn't his, so he left. What happened then? I think, maybe like seven years after that, Ben started coming around, and I think... I think she called him. 'Cause by then, I'd started to get into a little... Whatever. It was... Um, you know, I think you need a napkin. - A what? - A napkin. I'm gonna get you a napkin. He was trying to suffocate Ben with a pillow. Wow. I know. I was really mad. I bet. Under the circumstances, I didn't think I could turn him in. Oh, you might want to reconsider that. Where is he now? He's at my house. He's asleep. He's dyslexic, you know. Ben. Yeah, well, I was never really sure what that is. Means it's really hard to read. When we were little, he couldn't read at all. Everybody thought there was something wrong with him. And there wasn't. He just... And then, I went away to college and every year, I'd come back, and he was just a bigger and bigger idiot. I always thought that... Ben would've been different if somebody was there to read to him. Hmm. You've had a really long day. Why don't you give yourself a break for five minutes? I could really do with an ice cube. Oh. What's this? - What is this? - l... Shit. I... No. - Maggie, l... - Gerry, I gotta go. Ben. Ben. Man, you can't just keep running off like this. You only said I had to stay in the fucking wheelchair, and I am in the fucking wheelchair. Is someone picking him up? Absolutely. I called the car service. We're in the middle of nowhere, Ben. There is no car service here. Uh, what did I say? Here he comes. My chauffeur. All right. Where you been? Mr. Farmer. Mr. Farmer, you're supposed to... Just, uh... Just taking care of some stuff. He's gonna die if you don't watch it. Thank you. Let's go. I got to get home. I got to get to City Hall. City Hall? - Yeah, to file a Claim. - What Claim? Um... Logging rights. - You're not doing any logging. - Mmm-hmm. No, that was just a lie. That was just a straight-up lie you told me. All right, you were just trying to steal Maggie's land from her. It's not her land. All right, you know what? You know what, give me that. Give me that. Stop being such a fucking jerk. Just try to get your health better. I have a historical claim to that property. And I'm gonna go to the auction, and I'm gonna... - It doesn't matter. - ...with the logging rights. And... The property, it's not... It's not coming up for auction. Why? What's this? It's a receipt. For Maggie's back taxes. You asshole. No. - You paid her property taxes? - Yeah. - You did? - I did. I had the money. And lwasn't doing anything with it. And even with the logging rights, your plan, it's just... It's not... A good plan. This is better. Help Maggie hold on to the land and bury the hatchet. And not in each other's skull. You know what? I'm just doing the best I can. God damn you. Ben, Ben. - Come on, you have to stop, Ben. - Shit. Stop, stop, all right. Would you just... You almost died! Ben, please, you almost... Would you just... You almost... You almost died. You almost died. Okay. What am I supposed to do now? Well, I don't care what you do, Maggie. Am I supposed to fall in love with you now? I didn't say you had to fall in love with me. 'Cause you can't expect that. I don't expect that. Well, you come in here, and you do this thing, like you expect it to solve everything. Well, you were the one that said everything had to stop. So I stopped it. And you expect something for that? No. I did it for me. I got all this money. I never have anything to spend it on. And your dad... Your dad was good to me. And he would've hated all this. So, I did it for me, and I did it for him. I'm sorry. Hey, Ben. Benny. It's me. Hey. Hey, Ray. That's Ben's chair. Ooh. Ooh! Maggie, how you been? Staying out of trouble? Well, I haven't tried to kill anybody today. You? So far so good, but the night is young, the moon is full. You brought food? Nobody ever feed you? Not much. - Is he even in there? - Hmm. Oh, yeah, he's in there. What's he doing? This Chicken is delicious. How do you cook this? I just roast it with a little garlic and lemon. Seriously, you think he's okay? Am I okay? Are you shitting me? I'm the walking dead. You can't kill me. Give me that thing. Ah. Anybody bring any beer? Maggie brought some chicken. This beer ain't gonna do it for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mmm. Hmm. Hungry? I'm thinking about it. I don't think we need a tablecloth. I've got the corn husked, and the water's about to boil, and the coleslaw's all ready, and I found the ketchup and the mustard and the relish, and there's tomatoes sliced right here with the onions. Two kinds of onions. Goodness. And there's buns for the hot dogs, and the hamburgers, and some cheese if you want to take them out to the Sheriff, 'cause he's been grilling like a lunatic for I don't know how long. Don't you want to take it out to the Sheriff? Oh. Well, I don't know. I mean... He's maybe not ready. I don't know. I mean... So, how are things going with Curt? Well, I don't... You know, I... We're not really... He's not, uh... I want to tell you something. It's just as easy to fall in love with a good man as it is to fall in love with a jerk. Huh? Let's take this out to the Sheriff. Yeah. Here you go. Away from your face. See, Daddy sometimes knows what he's talking about. All right, now go, have fun. Come on over here. Grab this one. Grab this. Not near your face though. Nowhere near your face. But roam around, roam around. All right, you need another one? There you go. No. That thing is too small. Wait. - I need one. I do. - You need one? You want one, but you didn't bring me a beer. We've got some more. Yeah, yeah. You're shooting out fire. I've run out. Oh, no, get around. - It's burning up. - Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Oh, what are you doing? Lighting us up? Ooh! Did you ever punk your brother or sister? I want to. Run around. And this part would've been all built if this one hadn't taken his backhoe back, or wherever that puny little thing went. Here it is. The cathedral in all its... Oh... Good idea. What's this? It's a time capsule. We buried it when we were kids. Yeah. Ben found it down by the pond. - Tony Pérez rookie card. Huh. - Yeah. All this stuff is priceless, and particularly this. Is that real? Why would we bury it if it wasn't real? Why would you bury anything? We were kids. - Yeah. - Oh. This is, uh... My dad. That's your granddad right there. That's your granddad. Who put the matches in there? Okay, you're a lawyer, so I'm loath to confess, but I have to. It was me. Why am I not surprised? I knew I was gonna be needing to spark things up a little bit. You know who that is? Yeah, it's Parker. Notorious Comanche chief. - Check this out right there. - He was reading it. - You don't know who that is? - Whoa, whoa. Yoo-hoo. Oh, my God. - What the... - Oh, my God! - Oh, damn! - There's the lips, there's... - Two handed booty grab. - Gerry! - Oh, my God. Love unleashed. - They ain't quitting either. - Wow. - There it is. Wow, that's the blueprint for how to do it. Yeah. At their age? Oh. That's so sexy. Subtitles : Deluxe
