Vanessa's always been, I think, the bravest of all of us. She had a lot of courage. The advice she used to give me was, "If you want something, go for it." Right now, even with what's happening to Vanessa, I'm not going to give up. Private First Class Vanessa Guillén was reported missing from Fort Hood on April 22nd. This had my attention from the very beginning. There was something odd about it. We want to bring Vanessa home as efficiently and as rapidly as possible. She's a soldier at a federal base, which it's supposed to be one of the safest places to be in, and apparently, it's not. All these things that you'd never think can happen in America was happening at this base. They're gonna railroad this family. I want Fort Hood to be shut down and to investigate every single one of them! Her case is grabbing headlines across the nation. People want to know, where is Vanessa Guillén? The Hispanic culture is a sleeping giant. And I feel like the Guillén family just, like, woke it up. - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! My daughter was a miracle. God left her with me, and she had a purpose. When she was ten, she told me, "Mom, when I grow up, I'll join the Army." I said, "No, mija, that's not for women." She said, "Don't be so dramatic, Mom! One day, I'll have to leave." "I know I'm gonna make it there." I thought it was a child thing, and she would forget. And then when she was turning 18, she told me in the bedroom, "Mom, remember when I said I'd either join the Army or become an astronaut?" Two things, be an astronaut and go to the moon, or go to the Army. I said, "You'd better go to the moon." "Go to the moon, daughter." When she turned 18, she came home and said, "I already enlisted." Go! Go! Go! Go! Vanessa did her boot camp at Fort Jackson. - One, two, three. - One! One, two, three... They had a super strict schedule. She was like, "It's hard." And I was like, "I bet." But she was very proud. She would write letters. "I love it here, the environment, everything." "I'm the fastest female. I can tell you that." "I shot 31 out of 40 shots with my M4." I was like, "There you go." I went to her graduation. She was literally glowing. That's when she tells me, "I'll be stationed at Fort Hood." I was happy to know that she was gonna be close to home, and she wasn't gonna be stationed in some other state or far, far away. What do we have here? Ay ay! Stop doing that. Me and Vanessa were good friends. We worked together. So every day at work, we'll, like, see each other. She was a firearms repairer, basically, a weapons mechanic. She used to come home every weekend. And then everything changed. April 22nd of 2020 was Vanessa's day off. The Army took this initiative to not bring anyone to work because that's when COVID started to spark. But Vanessa received a message saying that she had to come in. I wish to never go back to that day. I remember Mayra coming home from work, and she tells me, "I think something is going on with Vanessa because she's not answering her calls." Her fiancée, Juan, said the same thing. I was working, and at lunchtime, I sent her a text. I thought she was still working. But it seemed like a long time. The messages didn't say "delivered." That's when I asked Mayra, "Have you talked to Vanessa?" Juan said, "I'm worried." I was like, "I don't know how to tell my parents this." Mayra said, "Mom, come." "What is it, baby?" "Don't you notice anything strange?" "Vanessa doesn't answer the text messages." I texted her, and no answer. I said, "How come?" I said, "Talk to the base and tell them to get her on the phone." "Right now!" I called the staff sergeant. "What's going on? I've been trying to reach my sister all day, and she doesn't answer the phone." And he's like, "Oh." "No one has seen her since lunchtime. We don't know anything about her." We were supposed to go hiking that day, like, whenever she got off of work. She texted me that morning. The weather said it was gonna rain. I told her that it's not raining. She didn't reply to that. A lot of hours went by. I was like, "Uh, this isn't normal." So me and Landy went to the Arms Room. She left her car keys, driver's license, and her wallet. It was, like, just something... Vanessa wouldn't leave that around. "You guys don't have cameras, nothing?" And they were like, "No." That's when I was like, "I'm not gonna be able to get anything done over the phone." I was like, "I'm leaving." I call Juan, and I'm like, "I'm gonna go look for her." And he was like, "Okay, pick me up." Never in my life had I been scared of something or someone as much as that night. It just felt like something really bad had happened. When I get there, it's like three in the morning. I called the staff sergeant, and no answer. So I go get a hotel room. I didn't go to sleep the whole night. I was just texting Mayra, "What's going on?" I felt helpless. The next morning, I go into the base, and things didn't feel right. I walk into the barracks, and the first sergeant gets off some truck. He said, "What's going on?" I was like, "You tell me what's going on." "It's about to be 24 hours." They weren't really open with me about who last saw her, and everything was really shady. I try to keep my mom calm. I could see she was very anxious. I said, "For God's sake, let's go." "These animals won't look for my child. I have to look for my daughter myself." The second I arrived at Killeen, do you know what I said? "Here smells like death." "Smells like death. This town is death." Eventually, my parents had to come to Killeen, and they were scared because there was no sign of Vanessa, and they couldn't go into the base because... their immigration status. I was born on a little ranch called Tierra Blanca, Rio Grande, Zacatecas in Mexico. We were all together, and it was a different time, a lot of joy, going outside to play, helping my dad in nature. He used to call me "my goat." That's what he called me because I was very thin. "My little goat, come here." Little goat but strong. My husband, since he was a child, they put him to work here to earn his money on his own. When I got married, that's when I came here. So we made a life here, here in Houston. I dedicated myself to our home. My little Vanessa, she was always a fighter and always for her dreams. She was special. She absolutely loved soccer. It was her passion. Vanessa and I met in high school, at the soccer field. We shared the same passion, and even though I was a beginner, the same love for the sports was still there. She was always very determined, especially testing herself physically. Even if it was a tough practice, you would see her in the weightlifting area. I'd pass by, and I'd be like, "What are you doing in here?" "It's time to go." She's like, "You wanna learn how to lift?" "You'll like this." I'm like, "Yeah, maybe some other time." She was very focused on school too. She was not at the lunch table chatting with her friends. She would be doing her work with her earphones. But of course, you know, with us, whenever we would hang out after that, she was very talkative and very girly. Because, usually, you see the girly side or the athletic side. She was both. The day that I met Vanessa was at a quinceañera party. In 2014, I think. Vanessa was very brave. She wasn't afraid of anyone. I liked to make her laugh. She always laughed. She was very nice. She was lovely. When we were starting to talk about where you want to go to college, "she was like," I'm going to the Army, getting a scholarship, and going from there." At first, for any, like, I'd say Hispanic, not necessarily Mexican, family, it's like, "You're going to the Army. You're a girl. That's not gonna happen." But for her, it was more like, uh, something she genuinely wanted to do. I was proud of her. That's a big step to take, joining, you know, military service, but my mom was the one being worried all the time. She used to say that it's a pretty rough place. And she was the first one to notice that something was wrong with Vanessa the few months after she was stationed at Fort Hood. She started not being able to sleep. She started losing weight. She would tell me that the Army was BS and that things weren't what they seemed. One day, she said, "Mommy, I'm having a hard time at the base." I said, "For what reason?" "I feel in my heart that you are hiding something from me." Because she'd told me there had been sexual harassment towards young women, young men, no matter what gender. She said, "It's true, Mom. People are being sexually assaulted." "You told me in December that girls were being harassed but not you." She said, "Mommy, I lied to you. I have been harassed." "By a superior, by a sergeant." Over at Fort Hood, it's a mafia that exists there. It's a mafia. It's nothing more than a place of corruption and evil. The Fort Hood military base in Killeen, Texas, is now under intense scrutiny. Calls to investigate the Army installation are growing louder. Fort Hood is a very vast base. It's one of the largest posts that the United States has. It's like its own world. Different bases have different reputations. Fort Hood is not one that has a very good reputation. Fort Hood has one of the highest sexual assault rates of any base in the American military. They've had two mass shootings. A soldier with mental problems shot dead three colleagues and wounded 16. It's the second deadly attack by a Fort Hood soldier in the last five years. There was a sexual assault advocate who was serving as a pimp prostituting out his soldiers. First Class Gregory McQueen is accused of luring female soldiers with money problems into having sex with other soldiers for cash. A lot of bad there. Two Fort Hood soldiers are accused of trying to smuggle immigrants through a Border Patrol checkpoint. A lot of missing soldiers, a lot of dead soldiers. Twenty-eight soldiers stationed at the US Army base have died this year. Fort Hood just seems to cultivate the worst of the worst when it comes to command culture, to that good ol' boys type of club. They call it "the Great Place," but at the end of the day, this place is definitely a black hole. A few weeks after the pandemic started, my editor asked me to look into a press release that we received from Fort Hood about Vanessa's disappearance. I remember that I went on to Facebook, and I started searching for family or friends. And I immediately found Mayra Guillén. And we got on the phone, and she described this really powerful scene. She was sitting alone in a hotel room in Killeen and hearing helicopters flying overhead, hoping that they were searching for her sister. She wanted answers and asked me to contact Fort Hood to see if I could find anything out that she didn't already know. My interaction with the military police was a joke, literally. The first sergeant told me, "Do you want to go into her room and see if anything's missing?" And I thought about it, and I was just like, "If it were to be part, God forbid, of an investigation, he shouldn't be letting me in." But I guess my curiosity won, and I was like, "Yeah, take me." And I was like, "Where's her keys? Where's her CAC card?" And then he had them in his pocket, and I was just like so confused. I was like, "This should have been all turned in." If this is the police I'm supposed to trust to look for my sister, I was like, "Game over." The US Army's Criminal Investigation Division, CID, was one of the main investigation units to handle Specialist Vanessa Guillén's disappearance. At the time, the people who were assigned to CID only had about three years of experience, and they had no expert oversight. They were also severely understaffed, overwhelmed with so many other cases on top of that. And so, it was all of those factors coming together at once that really hindered the investigation. That same day, they were like, "We have to go do a police report." And we go to the station. They start calling in anyone that might have last seen her or anyone that she interacted with the day and the previous day. They stand there and stare at each one of them. I tried to memorize their faces. One guy, he literally looked at me and laughed, and then he left. And I told Juan, I was like, "Did you see that?" And he's like, "Yeah." I started questioning myself, I was like, "Who is he?" I learned that this was Robinson. The day Guillén disappeared, we were trying to figure out who was the last person with her, and someone says, "Robinson." He was an armorer, and she was an arms mechanic. We got somebody that had Robinson's number, and we called him. He was like, "I sent her to the motor pool." I said, "Did she say anything when she was leaving?" He said, "No." And then he hung up. So I gave CID Robinson's phone number, and they were just like, "Yeah, we're going to look into it." My sister wakes me up, and she's like, "Frida, have you seen Vanessa's missing?" I was like, "What? What do you mean?" And she's like, "Go on Mayra's Twitter." I was shocked. Like, she's in the Army. She's supposed to be safe there. Hello, everyone. This video was made to spread awareness on Vanessa's disappearance... We started posting on social media. At first, I started posting on my accounts. And then I started making a Facebook page. I named it "Find Vanessa Guillén." The people in my hometown, who knew Vanessa, started sharing the Facebook page as well. Help us find Vanessa. We need her home. Vanessa Guillén, we need you back home with us. Please, help her family find her. Please, every share counts. It has been seven days since Vanessa was last seen here on Fort Hood. It felt like it's been forever. It actually feels like so much longer than a week. I would reach out to Fort Hood every few days asking for updates, and they would always send me back to the press releases. So it was really, really hard to get information. They also really failed to inform the family about search efforts. Because of the frustration of not having answers, we decided, if no one wants to talk to us, we are going to talk to them. We want answers! We started protesting the first week of May in front of Fort Hood. Where is Vanessa? We called out people, like, from social media. "Come over here. Bring posters, bring pictures and demand for her to be found." We want Vanessa! We want Vanessa! Each Friday, we'd have more people. We would make, like, banners. And I'd stand out there with my phone recording, "We're outside of Killeen." "Our friend's been missing for a week, two weeks now." "She was supposed to be in this base." - What do we want? - Vanessa! - When do we want her? - Now! Looking at that quote saying "the Great Place," it made me so frustrated. I want justice, and I want answers. You have all the technology. You have all the materials. But you can't find my sister? Seeing Lupe during those protests was very heartbreaking, but that was something that I think was also important for the media and for people to see, like, this is actually happening, a 16-year-old's out here crying for her sister, and it seems like we're not getting any help yet. Where's my sister? They know where she is, and I want them to speak up. We need answers! It's been four weeks. Let's keep going until I have my daughter. There was a new push to find the missing Fort Hood soldier... Vanessa Guillén was last seen at Fort... Communication with officials on Fort Hood has been limited. We made sure Fort Hood saw what we were doing and that we weren't gonna back down. We want Vanessa! We want answers! I really didn't know what I was entitled to ask as far as legal questions and what information they could give me and they couldn't. I needed someone that was gonna be honest and knew the system. So I started searching for military lawyers. Eventually, someone messaged me, "I know someone." Mayra called me, and she said, "I understand you are the right person to do this. "You have a lot of background in this." I said, "Yes." "I have military clients at bases all over, not just the country, the world." "I have experience dealing with the military." "I know the language that they speak." "I would be more than honored to help you guys." As I was talking with her, I felt this connection instantly. She was like, "It'll be, like, pro bono, and we'll see where things take us." She was able to get things moving. Of course our most important thing was to find Vanessa. I saw that the military did not give a damn. They're gonna railroad this family. That's when I said, "We need to do our own investigation." I started reaching out to all the people I knew that could get me information. This was gonna be a full-on effort. Because we weren't getting answers from Fort Hood, we reached out to EquuSearch, an organization that dedicate themselves to help find missing people. And they were able to help us. Texas EquuSearch has searched several areas around Fort Hood, looking for anything that might lead to Vanessa. The Army was hesitant about letting them join the search, but since they were on the public spotlight, they had no other option. Just hoping the right person sees the flyer and says, "I need to make a phone call." When I talked to Tim, he's like, "They don't like me. They don't wanna tell me information." I'm like, "They don't like anyone that's gonna figure this out." I was like, "We're going to find her no matter what." No matter how long it takes, I just want my sister. I looked for my daughter everywhere, like a weeping woman in a sea of tears. In the ditches... ...the railroads. With my rosary praying, "I'm gonna find her." "I swear. I'm gonna find her." She wasn't swallowed up by the earth. I'm going to find her. No higher-up from the base had reached out until word started getting out. I was just like, "Wow, two months later, you wanna say something?" On 22 April, Vanessa Guillén, PFC in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, was at her place of duty, and around noon is the last time anyone has seen her. Somebody, some person out there, has the piece of information we need to bring Vanessa home. We need to bring Vanessa back to her Army family. An extensive search is now underway by military members, as well as military police. The Army's Criminal Investigation Command is leading the investigation. The detectives of Fort Hood had me going crazy. I had no patience. I cried every night and had no sleep. Not sleeping, and crying. I'm gonna find my daughter. My mom thought it was very important to point out the sexual harassment, but basically, they ignored it. I asked myself one night that I couldn't sleep, like, "Should I post this or not?" I mean, it is the military, and I was just like, "I mean, what if they... I get in trouble?" I decide to post it. Lupe mentioned to me one day, "Have you seen on Twitter the hashtag?" Then she starts showing me all these stories. People using my sister as a resemblance of themselves on Facebook and Instagram, everywhere. This officer arrived at my home, and I was violently raped. This leader of mine took me under his wing. He groomed me so that he could abuse me. It's so much more than a physical assault. If I couldn't stop that from happening, how do I ever protect myself again? I remember that hashtag coming out and watching everybody explode. I changed my profile picture on social media. I made it a picture of Vanessa, and I wrote #IAmVanessaGuillén. I remember saying, "My God, she is us. This is us." I was assaulted in '92. Vanessa was 2020. As we're talking right now, someone is getting assaulted. Someone is getting harassed in the military. - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! We need everybody to tell the Guillén family they are not alone! Seeing people coming from all over the places made us have that piece of hope. It kept growing and growing. - In Houston. - I say no justice! - Austin, San Antonio. - We say no justice! California. There are so many murals in Mexico where my parents, you know, were born. In places like Egypt, there were posters saying, "I am Vanessa Guillén," and at military installations across the globe, who were all rallying behind the family. We're about to bring you a press conference live from Fort Hood about the disappearance of Vanessa Guillén. Let's take a listen. This case has stirred up a lot of questions about sexual assault and the way that Fort Hood is handling those kinds of cases. What do you have to say to the public about that? Each allegation of sexual assault or sexual harassment is fully investigated, regardless of the source or what it's related to, whether it's tied to Specialist Guillén's disappearance or not. We take those allegations, and all allegations, seriously. We're gonna pursue them to our fullest extent. It's not acceptable. There was more than one individual making Vanessa feel uncomfortable at work. They both said inappropriate things to her, and both of those individuals were in charge of us. She didn't feel comfortable coming forward. She didn't really think any action was going to be taken. Good afternoon. There has been no information, and we've interviewed hundreds of people to include all acquaintances and coworkers of Miss Guillén. So there's no allegation whatsoever that she's been sexually assaulted or harassed, and any hint of information that was sexual harassment was completely looked at without any credible information. This press conference boiled my blood. They were basically saying that she lied. How dare you come on national TV and say she was not sexually harassed? That's some gall. They knew a lot more at the time than they were letting us know. This morning, we went in with a lot of questions. We got some answers, but we still have a lot of questions. They have now, uh, used the words "foul play." And they're following all the leads that they can. They won't tell us who they're investigating or why. We want to know what happened, and who is a cover-up for who, and why they're covering up. That day was very intense. I know my mom didn't want to go that day. She was very emotionally not well. Uh... First of all, I want to thank God for getting me out of bed to come here. Because it took them too long to look for my daughter. I begged them from the beginning to look for my daughter. They never did it. Why until now are they making this show of searching for my daughter? Why now? I demand justice and respect for me and my daughter, a soldier that enlists in the military to serve her country and all of us. Because God forbid she is found dead, I will shut down this base! We will continue on. A couple days later, it was my birthday. My aunt said, "Have you checked your phone?" And I'm like, "No." She said, "There's something on the news." There were human remains found here this morning around 11:30. Bell County Sheriff's Department alerted the FBI, alerted Army CID who came out... I get a call from Tim Miller, the founder of Texas EquuSearch. He was just... very straightforward, and he described certain things that I can't say. I just can't say them. They won't come out, and, um... my aunt hears, like, my cry, and she comes, and she's like, "You can't let your mom see you." And... I had to fix myself in, like, two minutes. So... I had to hold everything in. Before the officer came, I told my mom. She said, "Mommy, let's talk." And I said, "They found something, right?" She said, "Yes, they did." I asked, "What did they find?" She replied, "Mom, you be strong, please." "Yes, I'll be strong." "Mom, I don't know how to tell you this." "Tell me, daughter. I'm strong. Tell me." She said, "It was our girl." I said, "What do you mean, our girl? Did they find her?" "Yes, Mommy." "But not the way you wanted." "Keep going." She said, "She was murdered." "No, forget it." I went crazy at that moment. I went crazy because of the pain. I said, "No, it's not our girl." She said, "Mommy, it's our girl." "Am I going to see her, to hug her, to caress her beautiful, virginal face?" "Yes, Mommy, but you have to wait." "Take the tranquilizer. Go to sleep." "You have to be well for the child, for her burial and all that." "But why did they do that to my daughter? Why?" "We don't know, Mom." "Tell me it's a nightmare, daughter." "No, Mommy." "It's our little Vanessa." Long live Vanessa Guillen! Long live! The area where Vanessa was found, something was burnt. They found, like, pieces of plastic. That day we talked to someone on behalf of the Army. Basically, they threw everything at us, like, the whole investigation without sympathy or anything. Then it came out on the news. When Specialist Vanessa Guillén vanished, several agencies, including the FBI, descended on Fort Hood to investigate. And now a new criminal complaint alleges she was murdered. Specialist Aaron Robinson struck Guillén in the head with a hammer multiple times, killing her on base before placing her in a box. He tells us initially that he went to the unit to do this training, and then he went back home. But because we were able to ping his cell phone, his alibi begins to break down. A subsequent ping of his cell phone led us to the Leon River. Another suspect, 22-year-old Cecily Aguilar, was charged in connection to Guillén's disappearance. In a five-page affidavit, Aguilar confesses to helping him get rid of Guillén's body. He took her out to a bridge near the Leon River, where the couple cut her up, set her on fire, and buried her in three separate places. The day that Vanessa's remains were discovered, Robinson was actually being held for breaking COVID protocols, and Army CID leaders failed to let the soldier, who is in charge of looking over Robinson, know that he was also suspected of killing Guillén. Robinson was allowed to keep his cell phone and read about Guillén's body being found, calling his girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar, saying, "Baby, they found pieces." That soldier somehow let Robinson escape from his watch. Officers located the suspect walking about six miles from Fort Hood. When police confronted the suspect, he pulled out a weapon and shot himself. They knew without a doubt that Robinson was the murderer, and they do not arrest him? It's a massive failure. Uh, CID agent should have been fired. The commander should have been fired. Uh, people should have been punished. None of that happened. How can this happen on a military base? How can this happen while she was on duty? Fort Hood, "the Great Place," hasn't done anything at all! And this is the proof they have lied to us! If the Army was hoping to mend fences with the Guillén family with this meeting, I do not believe that happened. And matter of fact, the family stated that they're just as angry as ever at how the Army has handled Vanessa Guillén's murder and the subsequent investigation into her murder. Lupe Guillén, Vanessa's sister, has told me the family still does not have several answers. Specifically, why Vanessa was murdered and why it took the Army so long to zero in on a fellow soldier. The Army and all the services use the Privacy Act to keep information away from victims and victims' families. So the Army will say things like, "We took appropriate action." And that's all you get to know. The military criminal justice system is different than the civilian criminal justice system, fundamentally, in that the civilian system is controlled by prosecutors and judges. In the military, it's controlled by a commander, and that commander's not a lawyer. They count on survivors and their families staying quiet or the media not being interested, and they miscalculated on this case dramatically because the Guillén family were not gonna stay quiet. Natalie taught me a lot about how the military has its own jurisdiction, and there can't be really anything done by civilians unless it's a higher authority, which in this case is Congress. So bringing in a bill would be the path to justice. Since there's no consequences with sexual harassment and sexual misconduct in the military, it's a free-for-all. The only way to fix it is through legislation. You could put all the policies out there you want. They have the policy! Is anyone following it? No. The military has done nothing to face this problem. Justice is not only about getting answers to my sister's murder. It's also about trying to help victims. I think it was our duty to fulfill, especially for Vanessa, as a victim of sexual harassment. My family talked about it. I was like, "Do you think this is a good idea?" "We'd be going back and forth to DC, having to meet with politicians." "Are you sure you wanna be all the way across the country?" I was actually born here in Houston. Been here, basically, all my life. This whole time that we've lived together, no one has separated. Being the oldest, it's a lot of responsibility. My mom usually needs help because she's not at her very best right now with her health. I mean, I feel like, to my siblings, I'm the big sister, like, and also kind of like a mom to them. My mom is the first mom. Mayra's the second mom. Vanessa, she was like the third mother. If I misbehaved at school or got a bad grade, she scolded me like she was my mom, and she'd tell me to do my homework and stare at me like, "Are you done yet?" My life before Vanessa's death was like any normal kid. Just living day by day, going to school, playing sports, you know, talking to friends. I was in tenth grade. When I think about going back to when my life was normal, it will never be normal. Every time that I think... try to find a normal life per se or go back to work and do what I was doing in the past, I think about Vanessa. It kind of became a responsibility for myself, for my family, to advocate for this. We had no other choice but to go and fight for a legislation under my sister's name to help other people. In order to make legislation into a law, Congress and senators have to vote on it, and the president has to sign it. It's a lot of work. Relatives of Vanessa Guillén met today with President Trump, where he told them the Department of Justice is investigating her murder. Natalie set up the meeting with Donald Trump. I'd like your help getting justice for my daughter. She wants your help to bring justice for what happened to her daughter. How can this happen on a military base, where you think everything's safe, but yet, the soldiers are not safe? We need a congressional investigation because it's impossible that no one saw or heard anything. And now, as you know, the DOJ and the FBI are there, and they're doing a very strong investigation, as is the Army, so they're doing a very strong investigation. You'd be making history with Vanessa. You'd be making history with Vanessa, because we need a change, and the change now, and we need something positive so the soldiers feel safe to be recruited, feel safe while serving their nation, feel honored to serve their nation but to feel respected and safe. That's how the bill will help them. We will get to the bottom of a lot of this and maybe all of it. Okay? - Thank you very much. - All right, let's go. Thank you. - No justice! - No peace! - No justice! - No peace! - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! The Guillén family went to meet with the president to talk about the I Am Vanessa Guillén bill. Lupe wore these high heels. Y'all probably noticed her heels. They're gorgeous. Vanessa bought these for her. So she wanted to wear them for her today. Lupe! It was the first time that I actually saw Lupe get on the stage and speak. She did not hold back. It's very emotional for me to be here because, yeah, I was coming barefoot because, I mean, Vanessa gave me those shoes, and I decided to wear them because this is for her, not for anyone else. This is for Vanessa. Because now, my sister is... ...with God. She's in a better place. But then the other survivors, they're here with their families, but my sister's not. Come on, Lupe! President Trump. He said he's going to support the #IAmVanessaGuillén bill. And for everyone that said, "The president will never meet with you," or, "You'll never enter the White House," well, we just met him. We have his support. And let me tell you something. He came up to me and asked me, "How old are you?" I said, "I'm 16." "He said," We need people like you. I'm impressed that you're very mature, and you speak your words, and you're not afraid to talk to no one." You shouldn't be afraid to talk to no one as well! Because if we have the president's support, I want the nation's support, because this is not a Republican-Democratic issue. This is not a race issue. This is a human issue, so it should be everyone's issue. It's important legislation. Usually, the ones sexually harassing are someone from the leadership, someone from the chain of command. Yet, those same commanders are the ones that take the investigation into their own hands. That's what the legislation is, to take it out the chain of command, have professional, you know, lawyers counseling for the victims. Congresswoman Jackie Speier and Oklahoma Congressman Markwayne Mullin are leading the bill's efforts. We were very excited to let the world know that this was actually the bill that Vanessa Guillén's family sponsored and was behind. I found that it was best to ask Jackie Speier to be the sponsor, or the cosponsor, of the bill because I knew she can get this done. So I became involved in this in 2010. The issue was being talked about, but it was like a throwback to the '50s and '60s. It was talked about in terms of the reason why it's happening is because women in the military were wearing provocative clothes or drinking too much. So in 2011, I introduced the first piece of legislation to deal with sexual assault in the military. Sexual assault scandals are the new norm for the military. This is the result of a legal system beholden to the chain of command that some are hell-bent on protecting. You're indicting the whole chain of command here. That's why I'm emotional about this. If you take the responsibility from that commanding officer, then you are eroding his ability to lead. The resistance came, initially, from the military. You know, they always mouth the right words, and yet, it was clearly an epidemic. We need to have commanders more involved in the solution to this problem, not less involved. Commanders need to be part of the good order and discipline for their units. They believed the commanders have to have exclusive authority over everything. Historically, commanders were in charge of whether you could get a divorce. Commanders were in charge of whether a doctor could amputate a leg. These original laws, 200 years ago, were designed totally for decisions to be made on the battlefield. That is not the case anymore. We've changed how we deal with these things, and we should continue that change by professionalizing the legal system as well. If one in five women say they are serving in the military, and they are receiving unwanted sexual contact, that's a huge problem. In the civil sector, they have the same problem. It's different in the military. Everything's about the chain of command. The chain of command controls the military justice system. They have complete authority over it. What I would say this is the equivalent of is, for example, if someone was an employee at Walmart, and they were sexually assaulted by another employee, and that floor manager says, "Okay. Well, I don't believe you. Done." Or he says, "Well, yeah, I think that's really serious, so I'm gonna take it to the office manager." And the office manager says, "Oh yeah. I don't think anything happened. Go away," or the office manager's saying, "We'll take it up to regional and see what they think." And regional saying, "We'll take it up to corporate, see what they think," and then eventually, some CEO at Walmart decides whether or not someone's prosecuted. It's absurd. No one would want to work in a system like that, but that's what the military has. The grisly murder of Vanessa Guillén forced the military to recognize that this was not going to be able to be one of those cases that you can sweep under the rug. We were promised that the bill was going to get voted on September 30th, which is Vanessa's birthday, so we were looking forward to it. And the day came, and all we got was a call saying that it wasn't able to be done. It was disappointing. This bill was gonna be put out on the floor, and it never happened. It never went on the floor for a vote. And so every bill dies if it's not passed by the end of the year, because next year, there's a whole new Congress, and that new Congress starts new. Congress took up the bill back in September, but it failed to advance. The I Am Vanessa Guillén Act failed to pass, and, you know, it's frustrating. It's sad, you know, to see all these victims, and I don't know of a way to help people, and nothing's being done. Ever since what happened with the bill... it's been really hard on my parents, and my mom has been sick. Move it to the right. I can never find the thing. - There we go. - There you go. When are they gonna start taking things out of the room? When I get some help. - When? - January, if God allows. As long as we're all okay. No. Sickness all around. After the tragedy, came the sickness. They say, "Calm comes after the storm." God almighty. I don't know. For us, sickness came after the storm. I know we don't have it easy, but it's like, "How do I manage with the stress?" There's days where I want to shut everyone out. Then I think back, and I'm like, "This isn't going to help anyone," so I have to, somehow, just keep going. Okay. New tonight, Cecily Aguilar's defense team wants her confession tossed out. Aguilar's defense attorney claims she was never read her Miranda rights. We've recently found out that Cecily Aguilar, uh, Robinson's girlfriend, was trying to throw out her confession, meaning everything she said to CID throughout, and, you know, we're not going to let that happen. God help you and protect you, both of you, on your long journey. My little daughter, God bless you and keep you healthy. And try not to cry, eh? Be strong. The confession has a huge role in this prosecution. Without it, I don't even know if there's evidence that would prove her guilty. We're going to Waco. We're gonna go to the courthouse and hear what she has to say. I am proud of them 'cause they're doing it for their sister. And as they promised her, they were gonna do everything they could to get to the truth. It's like, "How dare you?" The family has a right to have some closure in their loss of their daughter. The biggest question of them all is, "Why?" "Why take her life? And then, basically, get rid of her completely?" I just don't understand how Aguilar helped him do such things. I honestly hope that they're questioning Aguilar to see what she knows. Justice! Justice! Justice for Vanessa! - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! My parents and my family did not want me to go into the courthouse because of my age, and going through it would have been kind of traumatic. - What's her name? - Vanessa! - Loud and proud! What do we want? - Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice for Vanessa! So I was like, "Well, if I can't do anything inside, then at least, I did something outside." I feel that it's... it would be a great idea to spend right now connecting as a community, so if anyone is willing to, like, speak and say their name, like, raise your hand or anything, I don't know. We're gonna pass it around. Okay? Mm-hmm. Good afternoon. I came from Austin. If we unite to demand justice for Vanessa, we will get justice. This means a lot 'cause I'm a survivor of sexual assault. You know, I hear lots of people say, "Oh, I'm not gonna make a difference." Well, I'm one person, and I'm here, and my voice is loud. All of us have a voice. That's why I say, "Be the voice. Be the change." We're here with you. Your fight is our fight. No matter the age, no matter the gender, no matter the race, in order for change to happen, we have to speak up. My name's Lupe Guillén. Um, I'm 17 years old. I'm still in high school. I'm Vanessa's youngest sister. When I was four or five years old, I had speaking problems. I couldn't talk at all. I started speaking at the age of seven. And I was ashamed for that, so I used to, like, just stay quiet. I didn't even try because, when I tried, like, I couldn't get it out, and it's like getting bullied for it. And I guess now, it drove me to, like, a very, you know, spoken-out person. I express my opinion when I have to. And I'm speaking for a good cause, and I'm here for it. The woman named Cecily Ann Aguilar is in there, inside, facing my family. And she still has the nerve to show her face after what she did to my sister. You saw a body being dismembered, being burned. And then you have the energy to dig up holes, to drive to a river, to be quiet for two months even though you saw us in the news every single day. She stole the chance for me to see her one more time. But my mom always says, "You just have to keep fighting," and every single day, I remind myself, "This is not only about Vanessa." It's about all of us. We hope that everything that's going on inside goes as we want. So thank you. We just got out of our hearing. The judge denied their request to suppress Cecily Aguilar's statement, her confession, uh, with what happened. One of the things we learned was that Cecily tried to allege that Aaron Robinson put a gun to her head the night that she helped him, uh, dispose of Vanessa's body. That was, you know, something that we find hard to believe. We're sure it's just part of her defense tactics. So, trying to spin the truth and the law didn't work today in her favor, and, hopefully, justice will prevail in this case. This is a step on the right direction. This is a step to justice for my sister, justice for Vanessa Guillén. And we will never stop fighting. We'll keep pushing. - Justice for Vanessa! - Justice for Vanessa! Justice for Vanessa! - Justice for Vanessa! - Justice for Vanessa! Tonight, the US Army is releasing a scathing report saying leaders at Fort Hood in Texas ignored complaints of sexual harassment from Vanessa Guillén. Army officials confirmed what Vanessa Guillén's family have been saying all along, that she was sexually harassed on Fort Hood. It was proven there was sexual harassment. Is that what you were investigating for five months? Is that what you had me in anguish for? That was the criminal investigation from the Army, to say what I had already told them. It was for that? By God, everyone knows that already. I know it being her mother. You don't have forgiveness from God. I'm actually glad that they were confirming what we were saying the whole time. That we weren't just saying things to say them. Because at some point, they were like, "You're lying about sexual harassment. There's no proof." This is an example of why we have this broken trust with the Army. The report found that in the summer of 2019, one of Vanessa's superiors tried to solicit her for a threesome. Later during a field training exercise, that same supervisor approached her as she was performing personal hygiene in the woods. She told her friends, and she told her superior that she was afraid that she was going to be retaliated against. How long did Fort Hood leadership know that she was sexually harassed? Was this common knowledge when they were repeatedly saying that there was no evidence to prove that she was? Army leaders were asked several times if they'd release the name of Vanessa Guillén's harasser, and they refused to do so. They also couldn't say whether or not that person would face criminal charges in the future. From talking to different soldiers at the base, there wasn't only one supervisor harassing her, but two. There's still one of them currently serving at Fort Hood. He's still getting his salary. Um, it's like nothing happened. He can still harm another person. According to investigators, this incident has no connection to her alleged killer, specialist Aaron Robinson, and there is no credible evidence that he harassed her, but he had harassed someone else. They think that if they keep on saying that Robinson did not sexually harass Vanessa, that we'll believe it. Given his reputation, there is a high likelihood that that happened more than anything. They have no idea because of their poor investigation of what he did to Vanessa before he killed her. I'd say it's more likely than anything that he killed her during the process of a sexual assault. Without a doubt to me, the Army's number one concern was to detach the murder from any allegation of sexual harassment or sexual assault. They were in the middle of the fight on the hill, and they could not have this family and Vanessa's disappearance be used as ammunition against them. The Army wasn't going to change on their own. The Army's only concern was about protecting the Army, and so legislation was the only real, uh, response to this. If the legislation gets reintroduced, victims will get the justice that my sister did not get. And so we have to keep going with it no matter how long it takes. Now that time did go by, it just makes things even harder. But at the end of the day, we have to find a way to get this done. If we got Congress to listen, then we can get Congress to pass the bill. What we decide to do is reintroduce a new bill and hope that that gets passed, because this is our last chance. There's no way that we're gonna have the momentum in the campaign like we have this year ever again. After the presidential elections under Biden's Administration, we decided to introduce the I Am Vanessa Guillén bill for the second time. We hope, you know, we get all the support to pass the House, the Senate, and go to the president to be signed into law. - How are you feeling? - A bit better. Okay. Tell Lupe to eat. Yes, look at this. Eat that fruit. It's healthy. Okay, let's talk later. Tell Natalie thanks for everything. Yes. - Okay, mija, bye-bye. - You're in my prayers. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. To say, "What is justice?" Justice isn't only incarcerating or holding the person who was part of the murder accountable. It's also about... fairness. Hello. Hi, Speaker. Mayra Guillén. Nice to see you again. It's been a while. - We promised you. - Thank you. - Good to see you, Speaker. - Hi, Lupe. How are you? Nice to see you again. We're never gonna get Vanessa back, but I believe, if this was my daughter, that the greatest thing you could ever do is have a law in your name and change history with that law, and that would be, in a sense, justice. Good afternoon, everyone. As Speaker, I'm proud to support Jackie Speier's I Am Vanessa Guillén Act. I thank you for helping us all keep our promise we made a year ago to the family that we would have legislation and it would make a difference. So we must be the voice, be the change and honor my sister. We're here to ensure that her name won't be forgotten. This change needs to happen, and it needs to happen now. - My mom says hi. - Thank you. - She thanks you for being with us. - Thank you for your words. Oh, look how my feet are. Why did you wear those shoes? I don't know. - Can we go take a picture over there? - That's what I wanted. Come. - We're taking a picture quickly. - Yeah. Okay, one. We've been seeing senators and congresswomen and men fighting for this for a decade. And it's every year, it's died and died and died. It becomes, like, one of those, "We don't wanna talk about this issue." I realized I have a bullhorn, and I need to make sure that everybody heard about it and every reporter knows. This is not gonna die on my watch. This has to change. And we have this machine rolling now, and we just got to get it passed into law. You have been very powerful in convincing members of Congress, but some members that supported it last year are not supporting it this year, so talk to them. We have meetings with congressmen, congresswomen to try to convince them to say yes to the bill. Right now, we're hoping to get a vote on it before the year ends because, if not, we would have to start all over again next year. - Hi. - Hi, Senator. How are you? Natalie Khawam. Good to see you again. - And this is Mayra Guillén. - Mayra. It's important that we keep the pressure on and that we make sure that this is a household issue, a mainstream issue. We are hopeful and believe the legislation will be passed this year. We're gaining traction on this. And for me, a turning point was... was your sister. Talking about Vanessa's murder often, it brings a lot of memories. So having to be repetitive over and over again, it's hard. When you suffer the loss that you did in such a horrible way, the human instinct is to, what the Bible calls, "curse the darkness." Hmm. The saintly instinct is to light a candle. That's what you're doing so it doesn't happen to anyone again. - Right. - Touching. There was a lot of highs and lows with who I felt like were gonna be on the good team and who were gonna be on the team that was gonna fight us. The basic ethic of the military is to protect your colleagues and subordinates, not to exploit them. Right. Despite all the momentum, there's still strong resistance within senior senators and senior congresspeople serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee to really sweeping fundamental reform. The determination that Vanessa always used to have comes into my mind. I'm going to do this in her memory. But I hate being, like, days and days far from my family, especially from my mom. How are you doing? How are you holding up? - Okay. It's just frustrating. - It's very frustrating. 'Cause traveling back and forth to DC and have nothing in our hands. We're just waiting for the legislation to pass. - So... - Yeah. Government's not made to work fast. Unfortunately, it's made to work very slow. And a lot of times, you get one shot at legislation, because, if you get it to the floor, and it fails, the chance of you getting it back to the floor are just not good. So right now, there is some opposition to it. Timing is the most important thing, and I don't know when that timing's gonna come available. Lupe spoke out so much that it affected her emotionally a lot. So I try to tell her, basically, that I'm proud of her. I never got the chance to grieve until now. That's why, you know, it's been hard. I tried to, like, you know, do it the right way. Yet there's no right way to grieve, and the anxiety you build up, I guess, now I get nervous no matter with one, two people, I... You know, it's something that it's now affecting me in my daily life. It's been overwhelming. I've kind of separated myself from a lot of things, like my friends and playing soccer. The memory just comes back of me playing soccer with my sister and the way I'm never going to be able to do that again. Now, I'm trying to go back to the way it was, but after going through a lot of stuff, the way you see the world, you see it way differently. I think all of us always need a break. Especially for our mental health. I'm not giving up on my sister. I'll be fighting for her, even if it's in the background. Lupe was forced to grow up. Now she has to go back to school and try to focus on getting back to normal. She deserves to enjoy her life. I need 300 more words in the essay. I think I wrote it really, really good. Yeah, I can review it. Just send it to me when you're done so I can read it. Hi, Lupe. I like your bangs. Natalie works hard, but she's also a very fun person to be around. "I've always told her," You're not one of those nine-to-five lawyers that I can't... like, after five, I can't call you and stuff like that." - Hello? - It's Mayra and me, Natalie. She took over my phone, Landy. She's been there for me, not only as a lawyer, but as a good friend, and she's even treated me like a daughter, so I... I appreciate her a lot. Thanks, Landy. Talk to you later. - All right. Bye. - Bye. This is not just a job for me. This is... a commitment, and my commitment to my family is just as strong. My parents are from Lebanon, and we left, uh, because of the civil war. My dad really wanted me to help others, and he said, "This is you giving back to this country that gave to you." I'm proud to be Lebanese, but I'm American to the core. Daddy, would you like the lights off? Are they distracting? I'm trying to get the... the beat to... Being an immigrant, you wanna help other immigrants. This is a calling. It's about becoming an extended family on a mission. New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's lengthy battle with the Pentagon to change the way victims of sexual assault in the military are treated has cleared a major hurdle. So just as an FYI, just a quick and dirty of this, the Gillibrand bill is expansive. It's more expansive. We really are doing the bill on just sexual assault in the military, which is what our focus was. She's doing her bill on all misdemeanors gonna be out of the chain of command. Versus us, we were just focused on the... the sexual assault. When we finally got through the process, and we had Jackie Speier championing the I Am Vanessa Guillén bill, we saw that Gillibrand had her bill, and that almost became, in a sense, competing bills. Even though one's in Senate, one's in the House, it was gonna put everybody in a position of, "Which one do we want?" So everything's changed right now. We're flying out to meet with Senator Gillibrand, but obviously, working together is what our goal is. To accomplish some legislation to come out of this together. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has a bill on the Senate side that she has worked very hard on. Um, I have a bill on the House side. Both bills take these cases of sexual assault out of the chain of command. They are similar, but they are not exact. So what needs to happen through this process is that we come up with, um, a single version. - Great to see you. - Thank you for being here. You must be tired of coming to Washington over and over again... - It's an experience. - To just keep demanding justice. - It's a calling, really. - Yeah. It's a full-time effort, but I think the work you've done to bring a coalition of people behind this idea really matters. Lifting your voice up by coming to Washington and knocking on doors and demanding meetings with senators works. I think it's essential. But I would not let people celebrate what's in the House version. It's a good first step. And we're very proud of the work we've done to get it that far, but it's not enough. It does sexual assault and harassment, but Vanessa's case would not be included because it doesn't include murder cases. Right. So we just have to be really clear about that because, unfortunately, what happens behind closed doors is they take out reforms that the DOD is not comfortable with. Right. And there will be four men in that conference room, and they do not support the full Vanessa Guillén Act. We have to really push on them, to insist. I completely agree. This is a family that has been through hell and back, trying to give voice to their murdered sister and daughter. It's important that her case would have had this independent justice system. Having their advocacy, having their support, and having a coalition of the leads in the House and all of us in the Senate is a defining aspect of this legislation and moving it forward. So what we decide to do is marry the two bills, come together, and know that we have the House and the Senate in support of this, which is a great move strategically. So everything is... I always say, "You can have all the plans you want and then go to the Hill and realize every day is a new day." - Stay well. Stay strong. - Will do. - We're gonna do this. - Thank you for your leadership. - Thank you. - Thank you for all your support. Today we announce the Vanessa Guillén Military Justice Improvement Increasing Prevention Act. Senator Gillibrand and I have dedicated the better part of ten years to right this wrong. We will pass this bill this year. We're really close to the end. This is like the final inning. If we don't get this, it's game over. This is our last chance. The push to overhaul the military's handling of sexual assault cases is moving towards becoming law. The US House voted Wednesday to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, which contains the revised I Am Vanessa Guillén Act. The bill now moves to the Senate before it makes its way to the White House. And there we go. So the bill did get passed in the House. Now, we're just waiting for the Senate vote. It's crazy. When things like this happen or even with the courts, I can't sleep as much as I would want to. Like, I'm just anxious, like, wanting to get it over with, so that's me, like, I hate doing that, but I can't help it either. Okay. Thank you. So... ...basically, the cheeks is what... Do whatever you wanna do. I like how you do the white under your eye and your eyelid. I now see it. Otherwise, my eyes would be closed. I would look like I have closed eyes in the pictures. I really want to stay positive, but I got to protect my clients and their expectations. I would hate to think that they raise our hopes up this high to, like, just let it drop, so... But you never know. This bill includes historic, sweeping reforms in how the military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault. Clerk, call the roll. Mr. Wyden, no. Mr. Ho even. Mr. Ho even, aye. Mrs. Hyde-Smith. Mrs. Hyde-Smith, aye. Mr. Durbin. Mr. Durbin, aye. Mr. Warner. Mr. Warner, aye. Miss Ernst, aye. Mr. White house, aye. On this vote, the yeas are 89. The nays are 10. The motion to concur is agreed to. Lawmakers for the first time agreeing on legislation that would hand military sexual assault cases to an independent prosecutor outside the chain of command. It's being called "historic reforms" to how the military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault. A lot of folks have been hailing this new legislation, this agreement, as a sea change, a giant leap forward. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Nana. You did it. "We." I wouldn't have been able to do anything without you. I couldn't do it without you either. - Thank you. - I'm proud of you. This has been worked on for over ten years now. To see we were able to accomplish it, it's something that I ask myself, "How did... how did we do it?" I mean, it shows, uh, the drive that family love can have, and it proves that if you want to move mountains, you can. President Biden signed an executive order today to make sexual harassment a crime under military law. These are historic changes and a step forward in a decades-long battle for reform. We made landmark reforms in military justice and to help end the epidemic of sexual violence and harassment in our armed forces. I'm just so proud of Mayra for having the courage, even though she doesn't like being in the public eye. To pass this legislation, I feel that Vanessa, you know, she didn't die in vain. What's so incredible about this is that we saw a family stand strong and make change. Senator Gillibrand, you said, "Yes, it does have some major reforms, but it doesn't go far enough," and you voted against it. Why? We had such a groundswell of support, and unfortunately, the conference committee chose to retain enormous amount of authority within the chain of command. Being able to offer a discharge, deciding which evidence is allowed, which expert witness is allowed, um, even just deciding judge, jury, prosecutor, defense counsel, it's all still sitting with Commander so-and-so, the decision of whether or not to prosecute. That's the only decision that the independent prosecutor gets to make, but it's a positive step because at least you have the beginning of a system that could eventually be independent. We just need to keep advocating. We need to keep pushing back. We need to keep explaining why just one step isn't adequate, that you need to fix the whole system. Say her name! Vanessa Guillén! Say her name! - Vanessa Guillén! - Vanessa! Present! - Vanessa! - Present! - Vanessa! - Present! Hello, how are you? How have you been? Good. There's so many things I could say. It's the second-year anniversary, and it feels like it was just yesterday... Long story short, the bill has been passed. Uh, it was a lot of hard work, and there's... There's, um, still more work to do on behalf of Vanessa and a lot of, uh, service members that are still currently suffering in silence, so, this year, I'll be in DC again. We're trying to get another act with all provisions that we proposed the first year, and, um, thank you, everyone, for coming today, and it means a lot. Vanessa Guillén's legacy in history is going to be defined as the person who changed the process. I've been saying the military was just one scandal away from real reform, and... and Vanessa, unfortunately, was that scandal. If her family had stayed silent, I don't know if we'd be where we are. You know, the price they've paid is immeasurable, but the impact they've had is also immeasurable. Guadalupe Guillén. The last few months of my life, I graduated high school. And I've been recently playing soccer. I want to get into journalism and go to college, get my diploma, and make my parents proud, make my sister proud. I would say I grew a lot as a person. Especially in politics. I do see myself, hopefully, one day, running for office and continuing to use my voice in order to get positive things done. It's a miracle that we were able to do such a thing after so many decades of actual lawmakers trying. It's crazy how, when we placed her here, all of that was empty. Now it's full. Well, we all die. Yet, we shouldn't die by getting killed. Now I just have to acknowledge that I may never know the answer of what happened to my sister. Going through this tough journey, it has taught me so much. Time goes by fast. Life is short, and while you're living life, you have to, you know, cherish every moment. My little piece of heaven, my Vanessa, in my heart and in everybody's heart around the world... because everybody got to know her. Now I understand why I felt something special for my daughter. Because God our Lord was lending her to me for a short time. She already had a destiny planned out, and she had a purpose.
