Let's see, Marga. What have your parents and your sister got you? Have you had a look to see if there's anything inside? Well, no. Yeah, look inside, bug. Come on, Marga! Marga! Watch me, bug. Let your sister do it, sweetie. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you... FILMAX presents a film by ALBERTO EVANGELIO. - Uncle, my tummy hurts. - I know, honey, I know. VISITOR 25 YEARS LATER My mom is worried. And now that everything's settled the best thing is for me to go there for a few days. - Right now? - Yes, sure, how. But, that's not what we'd agreed, Marga. What else am I going to do? My mom is in no state to go there now. Have you ever thought about me? About how I'm going to feel? I thought you wouldn't mind. This way, you'll have more time to find a new place. Hey. Let's make this easy on ourselves. I brought you this. I found it in the house when I was moving things from the building work. Marga, what's going on? Has something happened with you two? What's the rush, jackass? What's the rush? Come on, then! Overtake, and if you're lucky you might kill yourself! I'm sorry, but I can't stand morons like him, I just can't. - Wow, new phone? - Yeah. Your husband got it for me. He had some rewards points saved up. Your mom. Olga? Yes, ma'am, she's here, don't worry. Yes, I already bought the tiles. Ask her about my dad. And tell her to let me know if they need anything. So, tell me. How's things with the artist of the family? Jesus... Just like when you were a kid. We could never get you to speak. See? I look after the place. But your mother always has something to moan about. You know what she's like. Come on. You're struggling a bit, aren't you? I'm getting old, honey, I'm getting old. Look, your friend's dog. Hello? Joaquim, in the end we painted the... Marga Esteve. How are you? Good. Really good. How's the work going? - Do you like it? If you don't... - Yeah, no, no. It's just I haven't been here in a long time. Long time no see. Yeah, yeah. I guess the work will be finished by then. I wanted to say thanks for taking care of my dad. - Don't worry about it. - No, I really mean it. I never tell you, but I think about it. And, well, thanks for lending me the laptop, for... I don't know, for everything. - You don't need to thank me. - OK. I was thinking I don't know what you think but the logo for the clinic is a little old-fashioned it's been the same since your dad founded it. So, I thought maybe you'd like to redesign it or... I don't know, something like that. I don't know, I'd never thought about it. But I don't know. Who knows? Maybe it's a good idea. I'll think about it and I'll let you know, OK? Marga! Out! Rulo! Out! You're going to get everything dirty. - What's up? - There's a leak. We'll have to check upstairs. Marga? Are you coming? What do you hide in here? Dead bodies or something? Yeah. But don't tell anyone. - Those keys won't work. - Why? Cause the padlock is brand new. Let me. After you. Damn. What an awesome space, huh? Yeah. But my dad never let us come up here. Look. Yeah. That's where the water's getting in. Who the fuck fixed this? Jesus. Fuck. That's for losers. Why didn't they buy you a Game Boy? - Hey, retard. What's wrong with you? - I'm warning you, Dani... It's her birthday. THE SKY CHANGED COLOUR METEOR SHOWER CAUSES CHILD'S DEATH Move! Marga! MARGA! Your mother will be in the waiting room. Don't worry, everything is gona be OK. Your father is very strong. Right... I think we should check on him every two hours. Thanks. - So? - How did it go? The stroke has caused paralysis in his right arm. And part of his face, but don't worry, he's not in danger. - So, what hap...? - So... We have to run some tests but... The best option is to keep him here for a few days. - Sure. - At least. I'll stay with him tonight. Well, mom, we'll talk about that later. Look, it's your brother. I'll tell him. I'll go outside 'cause the signal in here isn't great. Joaquim. No, no, no, we're at the clinic. Sweetie, since when does Dani smoke? Ahh, he probably confiscated them from one of his patients. Ah. - Hey, step by step. - Yes. - He's in good hands. - I know. I'll sleep on the sofa if you want, then you can go to bed and get some sleep. No, don't worry. I'll sleep on the sofa, that's what we said. Until you find an apartment, right? Listen... Don't say anything to my mom, I'd rather tell her myself. I don't want to worry her just now. Oh, sweetie, we can't go back until the workers are done. We'll find a way to sort this out. I'll take care of everything. Don't worry. Just relax. I know, but... this was the last thing your dad needed. Mom, you should get some rest, you know? Yes. - Here, drink this. - Thanks. OK, here comes the lecture. No really, I want to hear it. No lecture, I'm serious. Why didn't you keep going? I don't know. I don't know. I think I started drawing because... Well, my sister used to draw really well and when she died, I guess it was my own way of... remembering her, of feeling like she was close to me. But then, well, life... You know what? You should take it up again. For her. Just saying. - What? - You haven't changed a bit. Yeah, I see. But you have. What? What is it? Nothing... It's just... I'm thinking of leaving the clinic. - Really? That's great! - No, it's temporary. It'll probably just be temporary... It's great! It doesn't matter, we have to celebrate. No, stop, there's nothing to celebrate it's only temporary, I haven't even picked up a pencil yet... I leave the windows unlocked, and the door open. In case she decides to return. She won't have to wait Nothing wold keep her back. I leave the songs without an ending. In case she never comes back And nothing was true. The house falls down Since she left I lost the track of the living room's axis. The house falls down Since she left I lost the track of the living room's axis. I'll LEND IT YOU. NO MORE EXCUSES. I leave the windows unlocked, and the door open. In case I feel like escaping I wouldn't have to wait Nothing wold keep me back. I leave the songs without an ending. In case one day I want to return And nothing was true. Here. I think there are two kinds of people, Marga. The ones who open beers like you and the ones who open them like me. Oh yeah? And how do you open them? Let's see, enlighten me. Well, like the rest of us humans. Oh. Shut up, you. Rulo, you little bastard. Woah woah! Hands up. Take off your shirt and jeans. Now! Take your clothes off! No, put me down! Ah! Bastard! Wait, hang on. What? What is it? Wait here. Fuck... Out! No, no, no, no, ho, no. Uncle, uncle. Carlos, call an ambulance. Call an ambulance, Carlos. Marga! Marga! Move! Marga! - How are you? - How's my mom? Shall we go and see her? Thanks for coming. Mom, when are you and dad coming back to the village? When the building work's finished. Good bye, thank you. I don't think it's a good idea to go back, Olga. Aureli's well looked after at the clinic. Hey. Hi. Olga... Thanks for coming. I'm really sorry. Marga. Marga, it's me, Carlos. Are you OK? - Hey. - Hey. - How are you doing? - Fine. Marga, do you want me to take you home? No. No, thanks. Why have you come? It's weird seeing both of you here. What's the point of these meetings if you then go and write the contracts any fucking way you want? There's nothing to discuss. Put it in and it's done, is it that difficult? Is it that hard for you to understand? Well, that's it. Thanks. Let's see, Marga. What have your parents and your sister got you? Have you had a look to see if there's anything inside? Well, no. Yeah, look inside, bug. Come on, Marga! Marga! MARGA GIFT 1 Come on, move the stone. Hi, Marga. I didn't want to bother you but all our tools are still at the house. Just let me know when's good for you and I'll arrange with the other guys to come and pick everything up, OK? Take care. Watch me, bug. Let your sister do it, honey. CONGRATULATIONS, BUG Carlos? Watch me, bug. I don't know, Marga. Maybe you were confused or half asleep. No. I think you should rest for a while, babe. I'm not making it up. Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Marga. I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through. Your father, your uncle... And the fucking separation on top of all this. I'm really sorry, babe. I'm pregnant. But... Is it...? - But, babe, why didn't you tell me? - I'm not going to keep it, Carlos. There's just no way. Yes. - Good morning, Margarita Esteve? - Yes. Speaking. I'm calling from MuAzoz Clinic. You have an appointment with Dr. Guti√£rrez at quarter to eleven. Yes. Yes, sure. Don't forget to bring the consent form with you. It must be signed. - You do have the consent form, don't you? - Yes, yes, I have it. TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY Do I need anything else? Just remember not to eat or drink anything this morning. Your father has been acting strange this week. - He wet himself yesterday. - Mom, why didn't you call me sooner? I would've come to visit you. No, there's no need, sweetie. I'm just a little nervous. I'm going to leave him on his own for a couple of hours. I have to go and meet your uncle's executor. But listen, mom, what exactly have they told you? The nurse said his blood sugar spiked and that he was on cortico-steroids. I don't understand. They're no good for his condition. But I just don't know anymore, sweetie. Have you talked to Dani about it? Yes, apparently the cortico-steroids are to help his circulation. And I thought that he might be able to speak again, poor thing... NO AH! ATTIC Enough! What do you want? What do you want?! Huh? What do you want?! Is it this? Huh? Hey. How are you, bug? Wait! Wait, relax. Don't move. Don't move. It's OK, it's me, Diana. You've come through to the other side. But I'll let Marga tell you. You're the only thing she's been able to think about since she found you. She's standing. Marga. Hey. I hope you're OK, I didn't mean to hurt you. I was just trying to talk to you and I didn't know how to get through to you. Don't be afraid, OK? I know all of this is really weird, but... I'm going to explain everything to you. We're going to explain everything to you. I don't know what you're looking at now, but... Look at me. You and me are the same person. It's just that our paths split when we were nine years old. The day of the accident, remember? - Don't move. Where's the video? - The tape is on there. It's ready. Don't move, you have to see this. Marga! Olga! From that day on, everything changed. No, no, no, it's too much for her first time. Marga, listen carefully. You have to look out for the clues we've given you. They're hidden so that no one else can find them. Marga, enough! And come back to us. TESSERACT FIRST STEPS: RULES FOR TRAVELLING STEP 1: WARM THE CUBE TO ACTIVATE IT STEP 2: TRAVEL IS ONLY POSSIBLE AT SPECIFIC TIMES WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU MARGA SURPRISE NA¬∞1 Wow, new phone? Yeah. Your husband got it for me. DANIEL OK. I'VE SENT THE BANK TRANSFER. DANIEL I NEED YOU TO LOG INTO HER LAPTOP WHEN SHE'S NOT THERE. JOAQUIM THEY HAVEN'T GOT INTO THE ATTIC. IT'S STILL LOCKED. DANIEL PASSWORD: JARDINMEDICO13. CALL ME AND I'll EXPLAIN. MARGA'S PASSWORDS Hey, Marga. What's up? Just a sec, my nieces are going crazy in here. - Better now? - Yeah, yeah. I can hear you now. How are you? Well... I sent you a message, I don't know if you read it. I'm sorry, it's just I've been a bit... Marga, I know... I know it's your decision but I wanted to ask you... Please, before making any decisions, could we talk about this? Please, could you do that for me? Of course. Sure, of course. I'm sorry about how I reacted the other day. We're going to sit down and talk about this properly, OK? OK. Carlos, I... I have to tell you something... I've found out something about Daniel. What? He has all my passwords. What passwords? Everything, Facebook, my email, absolutely everything. But, I don't understand, how do you know? This laptop, right? We share it and we have, like, two users on it. So I started looking and... He's been monitoring me for a year, Carlos. What the...? Son of a bitch. - So, he knows about us then...? - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But it looks like... It looks like he has hurt my father from the beginning. What? What do you mean, Marga? Carlos, my dad is getting worse and it's Dani who's in control of his medication. He's obviously giving him something that's making him worse. Wait, wait, hang on. Why would he do that, huh? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I guess... He wants me to go back, maybe? If my dad gets worse, he might think they need me there and... Do you know what I mean? Marga... I don't know. - I think you need to rest. - No Carlos, no. No, what I need is for you to help me. Well, I wish I could, but I don't know how. We... The other day, at the funeral, I saw him smoking outside, arguing with someone, but I don't think it... Wait, wait, what? What did you say? He was smoking? Yeah, so? What was that noise? Hey, what's going on? Nothing, it's OK. It's raining and I've probably left a window open. - I'll go and check it now. Don't worry. - Do you want me to come over? No, babe, don't worry, it's OK. Trust me, OK? I'll call you if I need anything. - Night, babe. - Night. - Ciao. - I love you. Marga! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Yeah? Are you sure? What's this? What happened? It's nothing, just a little cut. I bumped into something this morning. - But, are you really OK? Are you sure? - I told you, I'm fine. I just have a stomach ache, like always. Everything's fine. What are you doing here? ...I didn't expect you. What do you mean you didn't expect me? You asked me to come here. You said so this morning. What? Yeah, you sent me an email. I don't... I don't remember that. Are you serious? Look. Could you come and pick me up? We could drive back to the city tomorrow. I need to be with my parents. You'd be doing me a favor. What is it? Am I going crazy? No. No, no, of course not. Honey, you haven't been answering your calls all day. Your mother is worried, I'm worried. I know, I'm a mess. I'll look for my phone later. I don't know where it is, but then I'll call my mom and... No, it's OK, it's OK. I'll call her. Just relax. - OK. - OK? What's all this mess? What happened here? Nothing, I tripped and... I'll clean it up tomorrow. - Shall I help? - No, leave it. - I'll help you right now, it's no problem. - No, you don't have to help me. I don't get it, Marga. It's like... I'm bothering you by being here. No, not at all. You're not bothering me, it's just that... I've been wrapped up with my illustrations for the last few days, in my own world. I wasn't expecting you, that's all. Well, in that case, I look forward to seeing them. What? - The illustrations. - Ah, yeah, yeah, sure. Of course. I'm really happy you've started drawing again. Thanks. Can I see your hand? What happened? Nothing. I was moving some furniture and stuff and... Let's get it fixed up. And this too. OK. - It hurts, doesn't it? - Yeah, a little. There you go. So, have these last few days been good for you? Yeah, yeah. I've had some time to think. That's great. To think. By the way, what happened with my dad? My mom called me this morning. No, nothing out of the ordinary. It's... It's a very complicated process. And it may get worse. I guess it's still too soon to know whether... - Whether he'll be able to speak again. - Exactly. Yeah. Well, I guess we just have to take things day by day, right? Day by day. I'm going to bed. I'm not feeling too good. Hey. - Shall I sleep in the living room or...? - No. I'll make the bed in the spare room for you, don't worry. No, thanks. I'll stay here. MARGA'S REALITY ATTIC If both cubes are in position on either side, heating one of them will activate the portal. This is not a game. It's dangerous. You should know that each time you travel, it takes its toll on you. You should only travel on the hour. This way, we will always be able to find each other. When you touch the cube, you will travel to the other side as if you where a ghost. But remember, you should never spend more than 15 minutes on the other side. HELLO Hi, Olga, good evening. How are you? Hi, Daniel. How was the journey? Yeah, fine, I got here OK. What about my daughter? Can you put her on? No, I can't put her on just now, she's sleeping. What do you want? TO HELP YOU Help me with what? Help me with what? My husband isn't letting me put him to bed, he's really on edge tonight. It's almost like he's trying to talk to me. - Tell the nurses to give him a sedative. - OK. And you should take some rest, too. OK. By the way... Did you manage to find your brother's phone among his belongings? No, no. I've looked for it, but all I've found is the paperwork from all his debts. BUSINESS TRANSFER AGREEMENT Here, we lost mom. Dad got sick and died shortly after. It was hard. We were alone, but... but deep down we were lucky. Because me and Diana have always been a great team. I was in charge of the illustrations and she took care of the design, the marketing. She taught me everything. Absolutely everything you can see here. TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY I fell madly in love. Imagine... We lived in this house. We were really happy. Diana lived in the city. With Daniel. When are you going to move back to the village? Well, that's a question you'll have to ask my husband. He worked at the family clinic. But a couple of years ago, when dad left us, me and Diana decided to sell it. And my sister convinced Dani to move back to the village. He gets paid less here, and he'd rather set something up by himself. What should I do? Another clinic... Diana, don't let him do it. Well, he's asked me if we would co-sign for him. - Excuse me? - What? I don't know, how long have you been living in the city for him? - Oh, please, not again, Marga. - No, I'm just saying. Hey. What are you doing here? Are you back already? No, no, Carlos has gone to pick up the food. Alone. CARLOS COLLEGE We are together in this. Count on me. MARGA YOU CAN COME NOW. I'M ALONE... XXX They're your father's. You don't mind if I take a look, do you? No, no, not at all. My sister wanted to separate from him. Ring any bells? Dani blamed me for everything. One night Carlos heard something in the hall. It all happened a year ago. Carlos... Carlos, no... I was seven months pregnant. They couldn't save Carlos either. After the fire, my sister moved in to take care of me. She lost Dani in the fire too, but in her case... you could say she was relieved. And one day, Diana found the cube while cleaning the attic. It seemed crazy, but... it was the cube that led me to you. Do you know what it meant to me? Finding you? If I could just do something to help you feel more complete... It was like it made me feel more alive. You have to go now. Oh, and read the notebook. Hey, finally. Marga, I'm sorry for calling so late, but you weren't picking up your phone and... I'm on my way to yours. Marga? Can you hear me? Are you there? Marga! ATTIC Marga? Are you there? Marga? Who are you? Who are you?! Marga, we have to get out of here, it's dangerous. Please, trust me. Listen to me. You have to trust me! Marga! Let me go! HE WANTS YOUR FATHER DEAD Marga. Open the door, please, come out of there. Marga! Please, listen to me. Listen to me. Don't believe a word she says, it's all lies! She'll come back at any moment. Marga... Marga, open the door. Please. Listen, we're in danger. Shut up, shut up, shut up! Stop, please. Marga, you have to tell me everything you know. Do you hear me? Everything. Marga, open the door. Open the door. I WON'T LET HIM HURT YOU No! No! No! Let me go! Get off him! Relax, I'm here. You're going to be OK. I'm here, OK? I'm going to sit you up, you're going to help me, OK? Let's go. On three. One, two... Good. There. There, there. - You're OK. - Marga. Don't worry, OK? I'm here. Marga, untie me, please. Don't believe anything she says, please. Marga. You're making a mistake, you're making a mistake. Please, let me go. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Why did you come here? Give me a single reason that I can believe as to why you're here. You know perfectly well that I'd never hurt you. Ever. Or him. She's the one who's doing all of this. It's her, she's tricking you, we have to go! Marga, we ha... No... Stop! Wait, wait, wait! Stop, let him speak, stop! STOP! You were spying on me. I've seen the contract. Your dad always said that he wanted to be the one to tell you the truth. And I didn't know what to do, we were going through a rough patch and arguing all the time and... - What did you do to my dad, Daniel? - I'm sorry, I didn't do anything. Answer me! She's deceiving you. Your father was the first to open the portal, the first one! I don't believe you, I don't believe you. - You have to believe me. - Convince me then, I don't believe you. You have to believe me, you don't understand anything. You can't go to the other side, Marga, please, listen to me. You can't go through. Listen, you can't go through, please, promise me you won't. - Shut up. Shut up. - Marga, don't do this. Marga, don't, please, you can't go through. Shut the fuck up. You should only travel on the hour. This way, we will always be able to find each other. Hey. How are you feeling, bug? Here, drink this, it'll help. Hang on, hang on. Where's Marga? Why can I speak? Diana, can you hear me? Why can you hear me? - You'd better sit down. - You can see me! - No, sit do... - What's happening, Diana? What's going on? Sit down. What the hell is going on, Diana? Sit down. Marga, Marga. Relax. Relax. Marga, listen to me! Really, everything's OK. Everything's OK, don't worry, ther... Hey. You and me are the same person. Marga, hey, hey! It's OK. No... TRANSMIGRATE Stay back. Don't come any closer. - Don't touch me. - Give it to me. - I said don't come any closer. - Give it to me. Don't fucking touch me! Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Do you want to lose the baby? Let me go, don't fucking touch me. Where's my wife? What have you done to her? What have you done to her? The same thing you did to the other Daniel. What have you done to her? - What have you done, Diana? - I don't know. You have to free her. See? There you go. It's OK. Listen to me, honey, we still have time. No, I can't, I can't take it anymore. I'll be by your side. Do what I say or you'll never forgive yourself. You know, when we were younger, we didn't miss mom very much. Our dad and uncle took good care of us. Me and my sister could do whatever we wanted. We were free. I wish I had left him sooner. It wasn't your fault. Yes, it was. And I've made nothing but mistakes since then. Marga, I couldn't bear you having an abortion and I kept thinking that your baby deserved a mother. But nobody can decide that for you, it's not fair. Can I trust you? You'll joints will feel numb at first, but it's normal, don't worry. There you go. I'm going to turn you over, OK? Help me. No, no. Wait. - Get back. - Relax. Relax. Think, think. Think about why I've untied you. You're free. I'm the only one who can help you. The only one. Shut up. Shut up, you should've thought of that sooner. - Relax, relax. There you go. - Don't even think about coming any closer. Listen to me. It's all my fault. Everything. I just want to fix this. Trust me. Trust me... To transmigrate, the cube must be placed in the same place on both sides and the organism must also be the same. My sister isn't expecting you. Come on. They did the same, didn't they? Your father convinced mine to travel because... because he had lost me and he missed me. For my dad, seeing your mother alive... Well, imagine. A miracle. They got sick because they went through too many times. "- Marga! Hat's happening? - Hurry! - It's Marga. Yes, send an ambulance. But it's not too late for you. You've been passing yourself off as her husband for a year. She'll never understand. Then she's alive. She's alive, she's alive. I know it was an accident. I know everything. I know that when we sold the clinic on the other side, you started thinking the family owed you something. And do you know how I know? Cause I'm just like you. That's why. That's why you have to listen to me. If you stay here, the clinic will be yours. It's what you've always wanted, I'm going to sign the contract. I just need you to let me get my life back. You owe that to me and you know it. Dani, do you really think she'll make things easier? No, you know she won't. Think about it. We could have the chance of a new life, to start over. Thank you. I think your mom is getting suspicious of me. Don't worry about that. I'll take care of it. SPIDER HI, CARLOS. IT'S MARGA. The door's open. Marga... Marga? MARGA? Marga? What happened? He wanted to kill me. 1 YEAR LATER Happy birthday dear Marga, Happy birthday to you. - Come on, buddy, don't bother us. - Oh, Rulo! I don't know, maybe selling the clinic is a little hasty.
