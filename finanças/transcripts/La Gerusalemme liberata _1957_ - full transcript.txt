JERUSALEM DELIVERED Godfrey of Bouillon has brought under one flag, before the walls of Jerusalem, the Christian leaders scattered in diverse bands to launch a decisive attack, and liberate the tomb of Christ. Before launching the final attack, our carpenters must complete construction on the wooden towers. I am well aware of your criticism and I can well understand your impatience, but we must not sacrifice the last 10 years of war to gain an insecure victory. We need to know before we become old, how long before we see the deliverance of Jerusalem? Maybe, our children will see it! By now, I'm resigned to leaving my bones here. If they don't kill me, I'll die of old age. If Godfrey counsels to wait, even you must defer to him. Calm, brothers, calm! You know I'm not a warrior, but a man of faith. I know God is watching over us. But first, we must deserve God's help and protection by remaining unified and in harmony. You swore allegiance to Godfrey. Keep faith with him. Instead of wasting words, let me prove to you with facts. You must see in person the importance of the undertaking. As you can see, our men are working day and night to complete the constructions. Let's hope that they'll be ready when Tancred arrives. The enemy will certainly be surprised when they see us jump out from the top of the towers, right over their walls. Yes, but how much time is left? Every day that passes allows the enemy to strengthen their defenses and get in new reinforcements. Yes, Argante's army is here. They wait for Clorinda. Don't compare those bastards with a soldier like Tancred! But you don't know Argante…! - Calm! Are we going to quarrel again? I promise that when Tancred is here, we'll attack with or without towers. Hold, halt! We camp here for the night. It was about time. The men are very tired. It must be the last stop. Jerusalem is still far away and delay may be fatal to our friends who are still fighting. Halt! Princess, this is our last chance. Come, let us escape. - No, you wouldn't have a chance. You two can stay here. I'm leaving. Have them set up camp. Set up camp! And bring me some fresh water, I'm thirsty. Stop! Where are you going? They discovered him. Why didn't you stop him? He was your subject, he would have obeyed you. Life isn't worth much when you've been deprived of all its gifts. You mean liberty? No. One can be free in captivity and a slave whilst free. A soldier like me wasn't made to understand ideas so fleeting. Here's the water. Have some. Aren't you thirsty? Thank you. - It's nothing. Let's go. Erminia, remember that you are a Musulman princess. - What do you mean? I know I have no right to speak to you like this, but your feelings for Tancred are not those a prisoner should have for his enemy. No. You're mistaken. Tancred has always been kind towards me. I couldn't… I understand. You're young and at your age, it's difficult to gainsay the heart. But take care, for passion ravages your heart as the wind the desert sands. Put it in place. What is it? - We've stopped a caravan of Muslim merchants on the way to Jerusalem. What should we do? - I'll come see. Is that them? - Yes. You think they could be Muslim soldiers heading for Jerusalem? Fine, you can spend the night in our camp. Go with them. But keep an eye on them. I don't want any surprises. Let's go! Are you also traveling with this caravan? Yes, what's so strange about that? One seldom meets a woman like you everyday in the desert. My whole life has been spent in the desert, roaming from one place to another. This life wasn't meant for a woman, especially when there's a war and this part of the desert is infested with thieves. And such people, I doubt act according to the laws of chivalry. War accustoms you to everything. There's nothing left to fear. That girl is Clorinda, the daughter of the King of Persia. Allah be praised! Let's hope they arrive in Jerusalem on time. Should we truly consider ourselves your guests or prisoners like them over there? Those are prisoners of war and they are treated humanely. But their freedom doesn't depend on me, but on the mercy of their fellow worshipers. - What do you mean? I'm not in the habit of killing prisoners like the Musulmen do. I'd rather keep them as hostages and trade their freedom for the lives of my soldiers. To prove that I truly consider you my guest, I'd like you to partake at my table. But… - I await you in my tent. Until then. What was he saying to you? - He invited me to his tent. I couldn't refuse. It might arouse suspicion. But if someone recognized you, it'd be dangerous. Better the risk than the slightest cloud of suspicion. There's only one among the prisoners who know me: Erminia, the daughter of the King of Antioch. And she won't talk. Can I help you? - I don't need anything. I believe rather this time, I could be of help to you. How? Before I tell you, give me your word of honor as a Crusader. Is that really necessary? - Yes. You must pledge not to hurt the person of whom I will speak. If their safety is dear to you, I promise. Speak. Among the caravan of Arabs welcomed in your camps, lurks an enemy. A woman? - Yes. But not a woman like me or any other. She's the leader of one of the most feared armies in Islam. She has taken the oath to exterminate all Christians. Tell me her name. Clorinda, the daughter of the King of Persia. Don't forget your promise. - I won't forget it. But I cannot forget the oaths I made to fight the infidels without mercy. But you… …why did you betray her secret? She should be her friend. - My first impulse was to save you. I wanted to repay you for your kindness towards me and the other prisoners. But I don't want the death of a woman who fights so courageously for my people. You have acted well. But you mustn't tell anybody that Clorinda is here. My promise wouldn't mean much to my fellow soldiers. Now go. The beautiful stranger has kept her word. Thank you. I always keep my word, don't you? You're not obliged to know the extent to which a Christian knight keeps faith to his promises. Have a seat. You think I'd poison you? Who could think of harming a beautiful creature like you? Indeed, on the contrary. I predict for you, a long and happy life. I don't fear any poison. My religion considers this kind of drink impure. That's one more reason for me to be happy I was raised in my faith. But one must admire a woman's charm even if she's an infidel like you. If you expect to find in me a shrinking violet ready to fall into your arms, you'll be disappointed. I never thought so. It's only your beauty makes your nature forgivable. Thank you. But I rather keep my nature than my beauty. Water? I believe even your god would consider it pure. What strange women there are among the musulmen. That female warrior of yours, for example. What's her name? Ah, right! Clorinda. She must be mad. Unless she's just a legend. - She's not a legend! And don't call someone mad who fights for their faith. Surely not. But we're not here to play with knives. I would only have used it to protect my honor. Have no fears. As my guest, you'll be shown all respect. Even one who admires and appreciates your beauty. But I can't deny that I feel for you a strange attraction. You're not like the others. When you put your hand to the knife, I thought for a moment… that you could be the famous Clorinda. And now? What do you think? Now I'm sure of it. One doesn't need to see your standards to know who you are. The legend of Clorinda has so affected you, that you see her in every woman you meet. Your every move betrays you. You're a warrior by instinct. If you're so sure I'm Clorinda, why don't you kill me? I don't know. I don't see in you an enemy. It's like I've always known you. You won't believe me but… you don't know what I felt since I've seen you. See! I even sent away my sentinels. You're free to go, if you like. You can leave without being disturbed. Only I know who you are. Why do you act so? One can only kill whom one hates. And I couldn't possibly kill you, now that I've met you. Why can't you leave to the men, these deeds of blood? You were born to make a man happy. Not this life of violence and horror. Unfortunately, everyone has their destiny. My life has no importance when the lives of my people are at stake. He who commands has obligations. I'll sincerely regret meeting you among my enemies. But I too have sworn to fight. And when I meet you on the field of battle… May heaven permit that meeting to never take place. That'll be the only way, we see each other again! If I meet you with you my sword raised, no force on earth could save you. It's useless, Clorinda. You couldn't match me. If one ill omened day, we meet on the battlefield…! Power isn't everything in war. Sometimes skill surpasses power. I must renounce any hope of convincing you. If only we never had met. But now it's impossible to forget you. Nonetheless, I'm glad we met. But don't say such things. You force me to leave you. Unless I'm your prisoner. I told you that you're free. I pray that Allah will give me the strength to forget your kindness. Wait. It's a sign of respect among my people. And also a way to remind me that I'm a woman. Goodbye. Goodbye, Tancred. You, Tancred, will camp here. Near the Damascus Gate, which is the most exposed location. But I doubt there'll be many forces. The nature of the place will make it difficult for the cavalry. Especially, as they won't have time, because we'll attack them beforehand. As you see, we await only your arrival to enter Jerusalem. It's as if Jerusalem were already ours. - Certainly. With you by my side, I could level the gates of hell. - Thank you. But my soldiers are tired. I hope you'll allow us a few days to regain our strength. Naturally, but we can't allow ourselves any days for idleness. Say no more. I know well at a time like this, every hour gained is precious. The mission, I was entrusted with, has failed. I couldn't make Godfrey of Bouillon accept an armistice. It was an impossible mission. Allah has raised this infidel's pride, so the greater will be his humiliation. And his arrogance went so far as to offer me this sword as a gift! Look. Blue steel blade. An exceptional cut. It seems a blade worthy of you. - It will be when I use it. I wait impatiently the hour it is bathed with Christian blood! What's that noise? - They're killing two more infidels. What have they done to be burned at the stake? They stole a sacred image to draw down damnation upon Jerusalem. But they're so young! Is it possible they could undertake such a dangerous mission? The have confessed. It's just they be punished. Why do you want to die too? Wasn't my sacrifice enough to save our brothers? - I did it out of love. Fate has separated us in life. Death will reunite us. Why are you concerned? Leave them to their fate. We cannot impede the course of justice. There are many ways to be just and glorify the name of Allah. In the enemy camp, there are hundreds of our brothers in prison. We could obtain their liberty by exchanging these Christians. We don't know if the Christians are open to an exchange. I don't want to expose myself to a refusal. - You won't be refused. I insist because I want to save a person you hold very dear. Tancred has taken prisoner Erminia, the daughter of the king of Antioch. My niece? I thought she was killed like her father? She's alive. I saw her with my own eyes. And Tancred would be willing to trade her for the liberty of the Christians. Stop the execution! Halt! Make way! It is stopped! Orders of Aladdin! Are you so naive to believe that Tancred would honor the pact? I've proof of his loyalty and generosity. And how did you get these proofs? While I was crossing the desert, his soldiers stopped us and he let me free instead of killing me. - He must not have known you. It's no proof of generosity to save any woman. Perhaps. But I'm convinced that you'd be insulted if a woman refused you. And that you'd kill her even is she were any woman. You've refused to marry me and I don't consider that an insult. My father promised me to you. And I'll keep it when the Christians are expelled from our land. And this is neither an insult nor a refusal. It's a pact. It's only that which gives me hope. But if I found out that there was a man who came between us, I'd kill him like a dog! Remember that. Aladdin was informed that Erminia, daughter of the King of Antioch, is your prisoner along with many others. And proposes a trade with other prisoners. This is the first time, the mususlmen have offered us such an opportunity. How did this decision come about? It was an idea suggested by Clorinda. Clorinda's idea? What is your answer? I have no objections. Discuss among yourselves the terms of the exchange. In the meantime, I'll go let Erminia know. Excuse me. Erminia? I've come to give you good news. You're returning to your people. You're free. Free? - Yes. It's due to Clorinda, who proposed a trade for Christian prisoners. I thought you would hear this news with joy. What's the matter? - Nothing. This is not the time to cry. Soon, you shall see you friends, relatives. I came myself to give you this news, because I have something to ask you. You will certainly see Clorinda. - Clorinda? - Yes. I asked them to bring you to her. Tell her… that I will never forget her. That this war won't always last and that she must survive. She mustn't chase after a glorious but useless death. It's only good for making suffer they who love them. I will tell her. - Thank you. Goodbye. I would've preferred that you kill me. Then my hate would have been justified. - What are you saying? Why hate me? - I know I'm unjust… …but I can't help it. You see, if Tancred didn't love you, I would still be near him. You understand? But he loves you. Since the first moment he saw you? - What are you saying? It's absurd! - It's the truth. He told me so himself before I left. What did he say? - What do words matter? He couldn't forget you from the first moment he met you. Tancred is my enemy. And always will be! - He doesn't believe so. I'm not interested. If we meet in combat, either I'll kill him or he'll kill me. But you could survive. And one day peace will come. And then… When will peace come? If one day, there is peace for us… …you will be a happy woman. Because you have lived as a woman. For you, it would be easy to rebuild you life next to the man you love. But for me, what use is the future to me? I've always lived amongst blood, massacres. And these memories will haunt me all of my life. Pardon, Clorinda. Argante asks to be received. Have him enter. Return to your room. I'll come to see you. Goodbye. Without meaning to, I heard you last words. I never knew you felt such horror for your past life. Indeed, I thought you felt a kind of pride in it like me and every good warrior. Haven't you ever thought that even a good warrior may not want to fight anymore? If you don't like to fight anymore, why do you live a life you don't want? I… love you, Clorinda. By my side, you could…! - Stop. Neither you nor I can decide our fate. If it's written that one day, I'll be your bride, I'll accept my destiny. But… - And you think I can accept a woman who doesn't love me! Who despises me? To refuse your love, doesn't mean contempt. For me, it's the same thing. You said you hated the war. I'm capable of even killing you, if I thought you had any weakness towards any Christian! Your suspicions are absurd. And I'll prove it on the battlefield. You'll soon have the opportunity. Aladdin agreed to let me attack their camp with a handful of our best soldiers. If you like, you can join me. Do you hope I refuse? - Not necessarily. You know that prophecy in which Jerusalem will fall when a golden cross appears on its walls. The people have identified that cross with the one on Rinaldo's coat of arms. And we can only end this superstition by one way: killing Rinaldo. - How? At dawn's light, we'll attempt to enter the Jaffa Gate and surrounding the camp, we'll fall on Rinaldo's tent before the Christians can organize a counter attack. I drink to the woman who has bewitched you. What's her name? Come, tell me. Let's call it a night. It's dawn. - I'm not moving while there's still drink. Rinaldo! Your soldiers are being attacked! Argante and Clorinda have entered the camp! What? Impossible! - We were surprised. Only Dudone is facing them. Let's go! Where is Rinaldo? - I don't know. Leave him! I want to kill him! Not so fast! Time to pay for your crimes! Everybody knows you're a murderer! I'll spare your life, if you tell me where Rinaldo is hiding. Rinaldo doesn't hide. - You see this blade? If Rinaldo were here, his breast would be receiving this instead of you! Rinaldo isn't here! Fall back! To your horses! - Quick! On your horses! Retreat! They must be cut off at the road! You go to the camp! Help the men! Let's go! Careful! Don't engage with them! Spread out! On your feet! Clorinda… Tancred… Throw down your weapon. Halt! If you take another step…! Halt, I said! Make one more step…! Let me go! What do you want in exchange for my freedom? Nothing. Only that you'll refrain from fighting and putting your life in danger. Death is the last thing I fear. Let me go, if that's your only reason! Come in here! If I wanted to take you prisoner, it would be easy. It's not that, Clorinda. Have you spoken with Erminia? Yes. And she told me, she loves you. Loves me? Yes. And she's ready to commit any folly to get you. That's absurd. The day Erminia left, she showed for me… …only… gratitude. Indeed, because of this I told her… - I know well what you told her. But your feelings for me are foolish. That girl suffers because she thinks I'm an obstacle to her love. You may be master of your feelings, but not mine. I love you Clorinda and I cannot love another woman. Please… I love you. No, we can't. Yes, I know many barriers separate us, but we will overcome them. Impossible! It's not only the war which separates us. What else then? - My fate is tied to Argante. If I don't die in combat, I promised to marry him. This choice was acceptable to me until the day I met you. Now I desire death like a liberation. If you want, stay with me. Argante can't force you to keep that promise. You forget there's another tie binding me to him. I'm not a woman like Erminia who can do as her heart dictates. I must fight for my faith! - A false faith! I didn't mean to offend you. Forgive me. - Why? To remind us we're enemies? You see? Too many things divide us. We mustn't love one another. Let me go. - Wait. - No. This meeting was useless. Reality has shown us that nothing can be done. Goodbye. - You're in danger. You can't go thus. By now your men have returned to their camp. Clorinda! I will wait for you. The war will end. It's no use, Tancred. Goodbye. Dudone, I swear I won't let your killer go unpunished. Godfrey, have you given the order to attack these miscreants? They've retreated the city, nothing could be done. Something must be done! They killed Dudone and trampled on my standards! - Calm down. We mourn like you for the death of Dudone. This is an insult to our cross. If we don't attack Jerusalem today, they'll consider us cowards. Prudence is not cowardice. - No, it's a fine excuse to hide behind. I won't answer your insult. Our discord would be too welcome to the Saracens. And I'd bet that was the reason for the raid. - What do you mean? They wouldn't have risked so much to kill a few soldiers and burn a few tents. Think about it. - I'm here to fight and not to think! Come on. That dog! Hiding who knows where. He didn't even have the courage to attack and defend his men. Though you didn't kill Rinaldo, Dudone's death is much more useful than you know. What use can the death of a leader like Dudone's be? Much. Because the fruit of contention has grown over his succession. My spies have informed me that Godfrey of Bouillon had to use his authority to stop Rinaldo from retaliating and assailing Jerusalem. I wish he had done it. - Right. But Godfrey's wisdom has stopped him. So there's discord between the two leaders. This discord can be more useful to us than a victorious battle. If we know how to profit from it. - How? You know Armida, the daughter of the king of Damascus. I think she has all the qualities to improve this situation. I've great respect for the intelligence and above all, the beauty of a woman like her. But I doubt that those qualities can help us fight the Christians. If you talk like that, I doubt your intelligence. Have you never heard the art of seduction is better than strength or weapons? Women in war are only useful if they can fight like Clorinda. Unfortunately, I don't know how to wield a sword like her. But I also know how to confront a Christian with my weapons. This is what I propose: I will face Rinaldo. With your languorous glances? Or with the dance of the seven veils? I'll go alone to the Christian camp under a false name. I'll tell them I hate Aladdin for persecuting me and my family. We cannot use methods like this. It's not fair. Armida is not a warrior. And fairness is a virtue no longer respected. What do you hope to achieve? That Rinaldo fall into your arms and die like in a trap? You can be sure the golden cross of Rinaldo will never appear on Jerusalem's walls! They've been arguing for an hour and haven't yet come to an agreement. I bet everything I have that Rinaldo will take command, replacing Dudone. Yes, the Knights of Ventura would slaughter all for him. And Germaldo won't object, you'll see that I'm right. Am I dreaming or is that a woman? Don't you see her? Who knows where they found her. Not bad for a Muslim, eh? Damn, I've never been so lucky! I refuse to argue further. I'll submit to the majority. You well know that a vote would only be a formality. You consider yourself chosen. But prior to voting, you should carefully assess the reasons for my opposition. Rinaldo, we captured a Muslim woman going about the camp. She wants to talk to you. Tell her to wait. - Not at all! Let her in. We can't waste time listening to a spy. - I give the orders here! Come forward. Excuse me, which one of you is Rinaldo? - Me. Speak. Yes, but what I must tell you is secret. I fear for my life. - Leave, everyone, please. We cannot delay the election. We must finish… You said yourself that you consider me chosen. Then, it's useless to discuss it. But my experience…! - What are you trying to say? Once elected, I'll take your advice. - Come, this is no time to argue. You may speak now. - Thank you. The story I must tell you is very sad. I need your trust. Sit down. Speak calmly, you're safe here. I come to you because your generosity is famous. I know what I'm going to ask is much but… What are you doing? I'm here to help you, if I can. Tell me what you want. Forgive me. I'm the daughter of the king of Damascus. After the death of my father, I embraced the Christian faith. Your faith. - And then? My new religion brought about the aversion and hatred of my uncle. The man who has usurped the kingdom of my father. The people of Damascus hate the usurper. If you lend your support, you'll be welcomed as liberators. Thus, you can count on the help of my people to fight against Aladdin. We are strong and numerous! - We cannot deny you our aid. It also offers an alliance that may be useful to our army. Sorry, but I cannot take away one man from our camps now. I understand. But it will be my end! You must not despair. I feel the end of the war is near. When Jerusalem is ours, none will refuse to put himself in the service of a just cause. You say you are Christians! You have no sense of humanity! Rinaldo! I do not consent! I don't need your permission to say what I think. You are people without Christian spirit without understanding. You speak without thinking. Anyway, this woman cannot stay here. - She'll stay with me, under my protection. My camp is great and she will find a tent. Thank you. But I don't want you to go against your friends on my account. I'll face my destiny alone. - You'll come with me. You've suffered enough. Come on. We cannot continue to support Rinaldo's bullying. You must intervene with your authority. Rinaldo was always impulsive. I prefer still to try to persuade him. Behold! There's still hope she'll stay with us. What are you thinking? Haven't you ever seen yourself? I'd have you know that in my village, I was quite the lady killer, oh! Come on! You're so generous. I can't take advantage, your masters… - I have no masters! And after the death of Dudone, no one gives me orders. You stay here. You're the most noble man I've ever met. - Just doing my duty. I hope to show my gratitude someday. But I cannot stay here. Godfrey was right. A woman cannot stay among soldiers. No one will dare touch you. You stay here in my tent. And I swear that anyone who tries to enter, will pay dearly. Then you'll have everyone against you. Why did you do it? If your deed makes you lose the favor of the other Crusaders, I'll… That has nothing to do with this. Maybe before my arrival. But now you've defied Godfrey, and he could choose another. - He wouldn't dare! Rinaldo! Take this woman away! You cannot defy Godfrey on her account. Get out of here! I'm sick of listening to advice. I don't take orders from Godfrey, let alone you! To command, it isn't only necessary to have valor but also prudence. If that woman stays here, I'll oppose you with all my strength! You see? What I told you is already happening. They'll choose another in your place. - Who? Maybe Germaldo? Now you'll see what happens to those that dare challenge me. You're a hypocrite! You want to command! I said what I think! I refuse to follow a madman! And you're mad if you keep acting like this! Retract what you said or else…! Or else what? You don't think I'm afraid of you? This is the fault of that woman. Get rid of her. And what are you looking at? Get him out of here! Why did you do it? It's my fault. If I didn't kill him, he wouldn't have hesitated to kill me. It has nothing to do with you. - No, I'm your ruin, Rinaldo. It's not possible! I must get away from here. - But… but, what are you saying? Don't you see that for your sake, I'm capable of even killing Godfrey! Rinaldo, the council has decided to punish you. And they know nothing of the death of Germaldo. - He insulted me! I do not know what's going on, but accepts the advice of a brother. Begone, before it is too late. Must I run away? - You have no other choice. You do not deserve punishment. But you cannot avoid it, if you stay here. You must leave right away. We'll leave together. Decide now, they'll be here soon. Come on. Squire, quickly, my horse! Prepare my things! We'll need an escort. Gather together 30 of my best men. And meet me at the grotto of the ferns. I hope fortune allows us to meet soon. Goodbye. Goodbye, Rinaldo. May the Lord watch over you. Rinaldo, in spite of all, is much loved by his men. If you were indulgent with him, it'd be a bad example for the others. You cannot take him prisoner, if you don't want to stir up discontent. An undisciplined army is worse than a discontented army. Rinaldo has fled. When I entered his tent, he was no longer there. He must be pursued. - Let him go. Thus you'll avoid the responsibility of having to arrest him. Each death marks the Crusader. A cross over the Holy Sepulcher. We await a dreamed of destiny. The return of the beloved fatherland. The Holy Cross has lost with Germaldo of Norway the help of a great and generous man. The devil armed Rinaldo's arm against his friend. Only the damnable power of Satan could lead Rinaldo to kill a brave warrior! But the Crusade should not, cannot stop! Because one and only one, is the indispensable aid for its success: The help of God. Dudone! Hurray! Dudone! Hurray! And now, join your voice to mine, to ask the Almighty to be with us. Our father who art in Heaven… hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come… Rinaldo has fallen with all his men into the trap set by Armida. And now he's her prisoner. A loyal and generous warrior like him, does not deserve to be betrayed like that! What else could you have done to oppose this betrayal? Yes I know. But I feel humiliated. I was full of faith when I arrived. Now, just the idea of ​​fighting, makes me shudder. I can't forget that the Christians have always been fair to us. And among them, there are noble and generous men, who deserve our admiration. Tancred… Yes. He as well. Tancred also. Twice, I could've killed him and twice, he saved my life. Twice? Have you seen him? - Yes. Where? During the assault on the Rinaldo's camp. He chased me, he faced me and disarmed me. He could have killed me. Instead, he helped me flee. And now? Now you're convinced that he loves you? Perhaps. But now, Tancred knows… his love can never be reciprocated. - No, don't lie. You don't want to admit it, but… you're in love with him too! This is what I heard. Now you know her true feelings. I should have guessed. But she'll pay dearly. Go. I'm glad you're here. You spare me the bother of looking for you. Who authorized you to use that tone? I'm not your slave. You might be after I tell Aladdin what I know. What do you know? I have nothing to hide. No? And your secret meetings with Tancred? Are they part of your tactic to win this war? I have no secret meetings with Tancred. He beat me in combat. And he spared my life, when he could've killed me. And you have rewarded him, naturally. We'll go together to see Aladdin. I'll take care of how you tell this story. To ensure victory, we will have to remove someone else. I ask you to grant me to fight a duel with Tancred. Let me challenge that bastard! I will kill him! I'm sure. And once he's removed, we'll go by sea to the Christians and all their accomplices. It's a futile duel. Argante's loss would not be decisive for the Muslims. However, it wouldn't be same for us, if Tancred… - Don't worry. With God's help, Tancred will emerge victorious. - Let's hope so. Stop! The two contenders have fought with courage and loyalty. The result of the match is equal: Neither victor nor vanquished. If the combatants accept, the combat will resume tomorrow. I can't take it anymore, you must help me, Clorinda. I… I must do something. I can't endure the idea of ​​being here. I must be at his side to help him. Look after him. And what do you want to do? - I want to go to him. Only you can help me get into the Christian camp. - Are you crazy? All the entrances of Jerusalem are guarded. - I know, I know. But you can pass through. No one would dare stop me, if you accompany me. No! It would be suicide. - Say rather that you don't want me to find Tancred. Clorinda, Argante wants to talk to you. Fine. I'm sorry but I must go. Now, calm down and wait for me here. Forgive me, Clorinda, for failing to keep my promise. I wanted to offer you the head of Tancred, but I'll do it tomorrow. "Don't sell the lion's skin before you have killed him." I just wanted to bring you a nice wedding gift. If you just called me to say that, you could've spared me. Clorinda, wait! I need you. This dog of a doctor is killing me! Go, I'll take care of him. That's Clorinda. Is she crazy? Going out alone at night? Open! If the Christians discover her, she risks getting us killed! Who goes there? It's Clorinda. Give the alarm! What's happening? - They're sounding the alarm. They must have discovered her. We should have stopped her. What do we do? Send for help? - You'd better warn the chiefs, they'll decide. Go. Clorinda has left the city. She must have been captured. What nonsense are you saying? Wearing your cloak, I would have sworn it was you. It must be Erminia. She wanted to reach the Christian camp. She took my cloak and… Let's hope they don't kill her. Her helmet. She must be near. Keep looking, bordering the channel. I'll go quickly to inform Tancred! There is no doubt, it's Clorinda's helmet. We found it near a channel. It seems she's hurt. She cannot be too far. Prepare my horse, I'll go look myself. - It might be a trap, a trick to fool us. She's too important to let slip away. Make haste. Have you found her? Nothing! No trace! - Return to camp! And if you capture her, bring her to me! Omar! Come here! Where are you going? Hey, you! - Come on, let's go. - Wait! Have you seen someone passing by here? - No, I haven’t seen anyone. Come on. - Hey, stop! Come here! What are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid. Mom, why don't you tell him? - Shut up! Go home! Stop! What did your son mean? If someone saw me talking to you, it would be the end for me and my son. Do you know something? Speak, I won't hurt you. In my hut, there's a soldier, Christian like you. He's mortally wounded. I had pity on him. And now I'm in danger. Take him away, please. - Where is he? - Not far from here. If you want, I'll go with you. - Let's go. Forgive me, I wanted to talk in secret because what I must say is very important. Go on, speak and don't waste time. News that I bring is worth gold, much gold. - You'll be rewarded if you deserve it. Come, speak! - It's about one of the Christian leaders. I know how you can arrest him without risking men. - Who is it? Tancred - Tancred? Here. Tell me where he is. Do you recognize me? It's Tancred. My friend, Rinaldo, what happened to him? Armida! She! - What? What about Armida? Armida! It was a trap. All the prisoners dead! Run! Run! Then that woman was Armida. Rinaldo, where is he? Where's Rinaldo? Leave him. He hears you not. If that was your intention, why didn't you surrender immediately? I already told you: I was afraid and ran away. If I had been killed, my only regret would've been to die without baptism. God sent you here to save your soul. You will be baptized. And find refuge with the shepherds, my friends, by the river. Clorinda! Finally! I've been looking for you all night. What were you doing last night at the Christian camp? - It wasn't me. Erminia put on my clothes to go to you. - Erminia? So why are you here? But…What's wrong? - I don't know. It's hard for a woman like me to express my feelings. Why did me meet? Clorinda… I must have been mad, coming to look for you. I must return. I don't want Armida's men to see me. It is dangerous for me and for you. - Armida? So you know what happened to Rinaldo? I wish I didn't. - Where is Rinaldo? What did they do to him? I've always respected your will to fight for a cause you think just. But I can't believe that you'd agreed to deceit and betrayal… - No, I didn't! I did everything I could to stop Armida. But it was useless. - Was Rinaldo killed? No, Tancred, but he might as well be. Armida took him prisoner. Death would be better for him. Tell me where he is. I must free him. - How will you do it? If Armida feels threatened, you'll hasten the death of Rinaldo. Armida won't know anything if I go alone. Alone? - Wouldn't you do so to save a friend? Armida's palace is in the valley of Traian. It’s a day's march from here. Use this to enter. They'll think that your part of my train. Goodbye. If Tancred is considered a man of honor, and the Christians loyal warriors, you must grant what I ask, on behalf of my commander, Godfrey of Bouillon: Delay the match 24 hours. Why should we be surprised if Tancred is afraid? Behold: the brave Christian warriors! They come begging like little milksops, to save the life of their false hero! Any Christian knight can silence one as boastful and arrogant as you. I'm ready to cross my sword with yours at any moment! I don't fight with old men! Coward! I will not allow you to insult me so! Stop! - What are you doing? I'm not Tancred to need your help! After this affront, no other solution exists than combat between the two armies. Come on. The fault was yours, Argante. You shouldn't have refused to fight. That act has compromised any possibility of an understanding with the Christians. See how my treachery has served me: To fall into my own net and fall in love with him. If you have strength to wait, you'll see that Rinaldo… - I have offered all: My palace, myself, the lives of his men. How can he resist me? Why does he prefer to rot in prison rather than surrender to me? When he's abandoned by all his men, then… - I will not wait! I want Rinaldo to come here now. You think I should give in to that snake to save us? Poor idiots! If I fell into her arms, I would end like all those traitors! Do you understand? - Quiet! No one reproaches you. Although, there is no chance for us, we will not abandon you. Rinaldo! Come, Armida wants to see you. I've waited in vain for your decision. What do you plan to do? I repeat what I said yesterday. If I had known what kind of woman you are, I would've strangled with my own hands! You accuse me without reason, but I act thus because I love you. I wouldn't tolerate your insults if I were not in love. - How dare you speak of love? You who are full of hatred, cruelty, vice! - Leave him be. You are more cruel in resisting me. That means the death of your men. Come. What are you plotting now? You were warned. Your every refusal will mean the death of one of your men. Humberto… Wretch! As I said, the fault is yours. You still have time to save others. Remember that. I remember only your infamy! I know a way to make you forget everything. Whenever you like. I'm the messenger of Clorinda. I need to speak to one of the prisoners. But really… - Quick, come with me! Let's go. He's an envoy of Clorinda. He wants to interrogate a Christian. - You must ask Armida's permission. Tancred! It's Tancred! Where is he? Where's Rinaldo? - There he is, he's coming. Hide yourselves! Tancred! - I'll explain later! Follow me! Hurry! You cannot enter! - Let me pass! Pardon me, Armida, the prisoners have escaped. They seized the weapons of the guards. It was difficult to hold them back. How did this happen? - I don't know. Two guards were killed. Keep back or they'll kill you! Halt! You have won. Now kill me, if you desire. My life without you is meaningless. No, it's better that you live to regret the damage you've done. I could have loved you, but it was you who didn't want it. Rinaldo… - Order your soldiers to let us go. Go then. Nobody will stop you. Hunger and disease are decimating the Christian army. Rinaldo and Tancred have left the camp. Their best men are gone. They can't hold out for much longer. This is the time to provoke a confrontation. It's useless. They'll never attack. Godfrey's tactic is to wait. It's clear he's waiting for Tancred. Even if Tancred returns, he can't change the fate of his army. - Not him! But the assault towers can change it. What towers? I've known for some time that Godfrey is readying towers to storm Jerusalem's walls. I fear that the intervention of these weapons will be decisive. Godfrey wouldn't dare assault the walls in the condition he is in. His soldiers wouldn't follow him. You forget they fight for a cause they believe holy. They'll all die, if their master tells them to. When do you think they'll attack? If the spies' reports are correct, they'll bring the towers along the walls tonight. And the attack will be launched at dawn. Are you ready? Forward! Watch out! Watch out! Courage! Courage! Your maid told me you weren't sleeping and could receive me. Why are you awake at this hour? I don't know. I can't sleep tonight. I think that tomorrow, I may no longer see the sky, the stars, the so beautiful moon. What are you saying? To think about those things before a battle… …could… - Could frighten me? No, have no fears. Do you think if I had been afraid to die, I would've lived I have done? I couldn't love you like I do, if I doubted your courage and valor. Thank you. I know how much you love and esteem me. But one cannot fight fate. Fear not, tomorrow we'll return victorious like always. You'll see. There'll be no assault towers. I managed to convince Aladdin to try to destroy them. This very night! Go out in pairs. One will kill the guard, the other will put resin on the towers. When everything is ready, you'll give us the signal. Agreed? Hurry! The time has come! Remain in waiting with the flaming torches. When the time comes, you go out to burn the towers. Once the torches are launched, you'll retreat immediately! The burning towers will alarm the Christians! Open the door! Go! Hurry up! As soon as you fire it, retreat! Forward! Help! Help! There! There! They want to burn the towers! Sound the alarm! To your weapons! Run to the towers! Go, put out the fire! We must save the towers! Hurry up, run! They have cut off our men's retreat. You must send immediately for reinforcements. - Yes, Sir! We have prevented the destruction of the towers. Now we must attack All are ready for battle, they await only your orders. This is the moment. God will protect us. We must hurry. I'll take command. - One moment. You mustn't expose yourself. Many valiant men are in attendance. Give them the high honor of leading our army in the assault. Rinaldo has come! Rinaldo is here! Long live Tancred! Tancred! Rinaldo! Forgive me, Godfrey. I know I was wrong, I'll expiate my guilt in fighting. It's not to me you should apologize, but to God. Go and fight, Rinaldo, save our brothers! You've arrived in time to participate in the assault. - God has willed it. Your presence will give us victory! Let's go. Hurry! To the walls! Death to the infidels. With the Holy Cross, we'll enter Jerusalem! Forward! This is the day of victory! No one can stop us. Forward! There is no doubt: they'll try to scale the wall. Don't worry, they'll get the reception they deserve. We can't wait any longer. We must prevent the towers from approaching the wall. Clorinda and I will go out and attempt a decisive strike. - Go! Bring the towers to the wall! Place the ladders! Follow me! Surrender, if you want to save your life! Clorinda… Tancred, what more could I wish for than to die in your arms. No, I'll save you. God cannot be so cruel. No, don't talk like that. You must believe in a just God. Now I can tell you, how much I loved you. If that is a crime, I'm atoning for it by my death. You can't… you mustn't die! I cannot live without you. Please… I have only a few moments left… I want to receive baptism. Let my soul be saved. And I'll die happy. It's useless to resist. It's best to retreat within the walls! Where is she? Where is Clorinda? I baptize you in the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Thank you. Heaven opens my soul. Be happy. As I am right now. No, Clorinda, no! Clorinda! Clorinda! Tancred! So here's where you hide to run from your fate like a coward! Spare me your insults! And respect my grief. Clorinda is dead. - What? - She's dead. Coward! You killed her! Wait, Argante! We mustn't fight here. One must be punished who has killed! - Listen to me! Clorinda was baptized! She died a Christian! Respect her will! Not true, Clorinda hated Christians! You're lying, scoundrel! You recognize this? It's Clorinda's sword! It'll be the first time it's used against an infidel! - And also the last! That's it! Bring it closer! Lower the bridge! Follow me! The golden cross is on the wall! Jerusalem has fallen! The prophecy is fulfilled! Flee! Tancred's horse! He cannot be far. Where could it be? - Look! His helmet. My God, let's hope he's still alive! There he is! Run! He's still alive, but he must have lost much blood. Thank you, my Lord. Your wisdom and the power of your arms have triumphed. Jerusalem and its people are now in your hands. I found in you and your people, strong and just enemies. Go, Aladdin. You are free. As free as all your people. My crusaders and I have not come to this land to hoard wealth. We have fought for our faith. And God has rewarded us enough by destining the victory to us.
