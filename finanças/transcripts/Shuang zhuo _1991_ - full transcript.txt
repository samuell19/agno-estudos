Talking about our Huihua, she has the best needlework! What's the use? She is very harsh in her words, I don't know how she could be someone's wife. Don't you worry, I guarantee I'll find her a rich family. She's lazy, playful and very curious, troublesome, who wants to marry her? Who says I'm getting married? Go to the kitchen.

Xiu, let's go play. I haven't finished my cooking. Look, is it pretty? Yes, whose is this? Ours. Let's go. Go? Look at my terrible dumplings! Don't be silly, they are nicely done. I don't get it why people want to get married? The bride can't even go to the loo. Mom said my younger brother can thus get married, because the betrothal money is 3000 dollars. Mom said we can build another house too. Silly girl... Mom has promised that we could share the same bed. We can do whatever we want. Right. What should we do? What do you have in mind? I don't know, do you have any idea? Don't you have any? Will you go if I tell you to kill yourself? Stupid. I don't know. Don't you know anything? Alright then, let's make a pledge, We vow as sisters to be man and wife Sure.... We vow as sisters to be man and wife We will live and die together. We are blood sisters forever.

Don't be afraid. We don't want to be spotted. Don't worry. Someone's peeping at us. Shameless. Let's go... Xiu, you just ran away after peeping at the boys. You are funny. It's your idea. Did you see? They also have the little peepee. Look at you getting all excited! We are vowed as man and wife You've forgotten me once you've seen the boys. We are all covered in clothes, but why not the little peepee? I think you'll forget all about me once you're married. I swear I won't. Who would believe you? If I lied, I'll never have a husband or a son. I don't believe you. How do I know whether you meant it or not. Alright, name something, I'll do it right away. Alright. Jump into the sea. OK.

I'll give you a piggy back ride. I think Goddess Mazu wants me dead. What should I do? Don't worry, it will hurt for a few days only. I'm dead. Mom says a little devil mights the women every month, so that we'll bleed and we can feel the pain. What's this about? I have no idea. All she told me was the little devil. Make it go away! Make it go away! Don't worry...it will be gone in a few days. There she is. She dresses strange for a young woman at her age. Exactly, she's not a kid anymore. Come in, Huihua. The matchmaker has been waiting for you. Huihua has grown so pretty! Nice needlework, when will you make one for me? Have some tea. Sure, thanks.

No, thanks. Take it. Thank you. Xiu... The boats are here, let's go. Mister, these women wear very special costumes. Yes, they are the Huian women. They get married when they're very young, and... move back to their own family 2 days after the wedding. Only after first child they can go to husband's house. Seeing all this is unbelievable. It's the 80s! Where are the boats? If I didn't lie, would you have left? Shut up, you sound awful. Bye. Bye. I think it's a good idea to learn opera, you can travel around with the troupe. It's fun and different. It's not easy. Xiaoyu said it she mastered this fan in 3 months. Forget about her! Listen to me. This means I want to be with you. This means I want to be with you. Interesting, what else? This means I like you. This means I like you. This means I want to kiss you. You want to kiss me? And? This means someone's peeping at us. This means... Someone's really peeping at us! Let's go! Let him take the picture! Don't be scared. Let's pose. Smile. The boats are here, let's go. What are you doing? Come over to help! Are you alright? I'm fine. Let me help you. Take this. Is my lover on your boat? Your lover? I haven't seen him, maybe he's on another boat. Catch. Are you sick, sister-in-law? I'm fine. You should go to the doctor's. The doctor said I'm fine. Damn it! You're a piece of useless shit! You might as well be dead, so clumsy! I worked hard for three months, and now you dropped the catch, what's wrong with you? You're as useless as a pig. She is unwell. Unwell? She might as well be dead. Don't do that. Sister-in-law. I'd be better off dead. C'mon, you've children, you can stay at your in-law's. house, and you are in charge of the money. He beats during the day, presses against me at nights. You're lucky, your man loves you. So what? I've no child, we only see each other thrice a year. I was pretty too when I first got married. Getting married for what? Who dares to beat me? I'd beat him to death first. I'll treat you to the movie and pop drinks tonight. Meizhen, your husband's here too. It's not a festival today, he couldn't see her. You must have mistaken someone else for him. Why all the rules? All these rules to keep, seeing your husband three times a year. Why? What for? It's time, let's go. Daughter-in-law, you come home with us. Mom, she's going to the movie with us. Don't be silly, who will do the house chores? It takes less than two hours at the movie, why can't she relax for a change? Your sister-in-law can't be as lazy as you, when you get married in the future, you won't live a life like this. You go ahead, I'm not going. Let's go. I'll help you! Let's go to your room, and see if you'd treat me better. Shit! That's disgusting! What the heck? Huihua said she saw you today. How could you be so careless? You must be more careful from now on. Got it. The marriages in the movies are so different from ours. I don't understand either. Meizhen left early, she must has gone to look for her husband. No way. Meizhen knows it's against the rules. If I don't get pregnant, we'll have to meet up secretly. It's really her! And her husband. I wish we could have a child soon. We're allowed to see each other three times a year, and it's often at the busiest festivals; It's not that easy. Let's go, we can't be spotted. I was pretty too when I first got married. Now I'm beat in the day, and pressed against at nights, I'd be better off dead. Hey, you didn't shut the door, aren't you afraid that someone will walk in? Who'd dare? I'll kill him. Are you done? It's my turn. Hop in. No way. Why not? Let me take a peek! I think you are crazy about men. There's nothing interesting to watch me taking a bath. Haven't you seen your sister-in-law in a bath? What's to look? She's had three children, and is constantly sick. Who'll watch her? Your brother does. He only beats her up. If I bump into a man like him, I'd use a pair of scissors. My sister-in-law was young and pretty when she first came, now she's overworked and got beaten up by him. If I meet someone as heartless as him, I'd rather be dead. Getting married for what? If you don't want to, forget it. Since the old days, Father to son, son to grandson, one generation after the next. Getting married is most appropriate. Most appropriate? That's a lie told by the men. All those customs and traditions, they do more harm than good. If we don't get married ever, it's not bad for us to stay together forever. Are you crazy? Sisters can't stay forever. It's destiny to be husband and wife. What destiny? A marriage fated by heavens, you will understand soon. What destiny? I don't want that kind of destiny. I don't want you to get married, and I won't either. Let's stay together, we will never leave the other behind. Xiu, what's the closer relationship? A regular marital one or the bond between sisters? I don't know, if I get married in the future... I'll tell you everything between him and me. No. You will fall in love with him. After you're married, you'll leave me behind. Just me, all alone by myself. No, we'll get married together, and we'll die together. Really? Have I ever lied to you? Alright then, swear. Swear? Whose heart has changed, and the other can catch her. How? Haunt her! Fine, I swear. Listen, all gods and spirits! I, Xiu, if I get married and forget about Huihua, I will die a terrible death. Xiu. Huihua, time to get up. Huihua, time to get up. Feed the bull earlier, and you can help your sister-in-law. You are like a man. I don't know what to do without you. Since I'm a man, let me give you a kiss. Kill it. Hurry. Is it dead? Yes. Why didn't you kill it? It's not poisonous. If it's dead, what about the little snakes? You're so kind. Xiu. Xiu, you're getting married next month, you should move back home. Huihua. What is it? You don't want me to get married? Says who? You will only be gone for two days, and then you will return to your own home. You've to keep me company during combing ceremony Three in...three out. Let me. Sit straight, and you have milk. Sit still, and your will have a fat and clever son. The mother takes the comb. The first comb, you two will grow old together, the second, you'll have lots of children & grandchilds. And you? Will you marry off and leave me on my own too? the third comb, happiness year after year. Huihua, why don't you come inside? Your sister forgot to take this. You won't come in? No. My sister kept asking for you. I won't go in. Huihua. You can beat me and scream at me all you want, please don't ignore me. Huihua. I won't rely on anyone. I won't see you anymore, go look for your husband. You know I don't want to get married. I don't know anything. Huihua and I vow as sisters to be man and wife, We will live and die together. Huihua and I vow as sisters to be man and wife, We will live and die together. I won't be ungrateful to you, and you won't be ungrateful to me. This is my favorite bracelet, keep it. And now we're sisters, pledging as "man and wife". And you will keep one of mine too. This will remind me of you. What are these? What? Let me take a look, what's that? Come on. Show me. What's these? Belts. Belts! Why so many? Of course. My husband can forget about having me. I'm yours. Xiu. I heard it, she has seven belts. I'm not lying. That's crazy! Who would wear seven belts? My grandma said she wore 1 3 belts on her wedding night. That's bullshit. What's the use anyway? She had your father, and your mom had you. It's just an act! You can't be so sure. Ah Zhen of Dajia would never give in, the next day... she jumped into the sea and killed herself. It's true. So there's a trick to undone the belts. You won't succeed if you're scared, and you'll be in trouble if you're too aggressive. You must be strong, as well as gentle. Guang, have you studied the Tang poems? I've studied a few. Just a few? Haven't you heard? If you know the Tang poems, you could at least recite them. On your wedding night, they could be helpful. Don't scare him. Listen you all. Oh wedding night, if you can't undo the belt, then you won't have any luck. then you won't have any luck. The bride wears colorful belts. A lot of them. And they all mean something auspicious. And they all mean something auspicious. The white one means grow old together. Purple means you will have children and grandchildren. The red one means good luck. The light green one means youth. The green one means longevity. The yellow one means you're blessed. And there's one with jewelry, there's a clip at the back. It's hard to undo when the beautiful woman turns. It's up to the husband. It's up to the husband. Take it slowly. She turns. And you can hold her. And you can hold her. "The floral path has never been swept for a guest, today for once the rough gate opens for the gentleman" Come with me, Guang. What is it? This is the key. What is it? Sorry, I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk, sorry. Sorry... Don't worry, I'm not drunk, Sit down. Sit down. The guys outside are terrible, do you know what this is? Of course you don't. Show me. I don't touch you, I won't hurt you. I just want to know how many belts you're wearing. Let me see. The white one means grow old together. Purple means you'll have children and grandchildren. Blue, red....Seven! Great! Seven of them. They said this is the key, it's a present. They said I should pour everything out while you're asleep. And then I scream, "Ants!" "Ants everywhere!" When you panic... You'll undo the belts one by one. See? They are terrible. Are you thirsty? Are you sure? You can't drink for three days, you must be thirsty! Drink. You're drunk. Drunk? By drinking water? Have a sip. That's right. Drink when thirsty, eat if hungry & sleep when sleepy. The pigpen is at the back. Go! Out! Hurry. Come here and take a look. Come on. Looks like you? I made it this morning. Try this cake, I made it. I'm not hungry. Alright. Sit down. Sit. My mom said I can't sit with my husband. Then I'll stand with you. Is it good? I put salt instead of sugar! Silly me. Why did you hit me? Mosquitoes! You're up to no good. I'm up to no good? What about you? Don't move, I want to look. No! Let me take a look. No, stop it. Last one. It's dawn, I have to go. I'll walk you home. Come on. It's fine, Guang. I'll see you to your village. It's fine, really. Be careful then. I won't see you until Mid Autumn Festival. Sister, mom is looking for you. Tell her that I'll be right back. Huihua, I'm back. Huihua.... You didn't sleep? I didn't sleep for two days, I miss you, and you? Same. I am worried that you might change. I'm glad you haven't. A little bit more, a little bit more. Let me. Alright, we're at the top. Wear this, don't catch a cold. Be careful. It's raining heavily, let's take a break. Was that your husband? Why don't you answer? Yes, he's my husband. Why is he so nice to you? Huihua. Are you two close like in the movies? Don't be silly. We're not kids anymore. We are sisters...vowed as man and wife. You just got married for a few months, why's he so nice to you? Do you have a lot of secrets hiding from me? Xiu, I just want to be with you forever. You're the only one who understand me. Huihua. Do you love me or your husband more? It's different. Yes, you've changed. Of course I love you. Really? You're not lying? I won't lie to you. It's mid-autumn, what will you take to your husband's? My mom has prepared some moon cakes. Come to my house tomorrow, we will walk together. I better wait for you here. I know, if you don't go through the fields, it's a shortcut to your husband's, right? Nonsense. Do you have to go? It's the Mid Autumn Festival, I have to go. Xiu... Do you have to go? Xiu... What's wrong? Are you hurt? What's wrong? I was waiting for you on the field. Sorry. Would you go or not? It's better to walk when there's still light. Don't wait for me. It hurts, Xiu. You go ahead first. Huihua... Guang. Xiu. What are you doing here? Waiting for you! I'm picking you up. Are you cold? Xiu. Sister-in-law. You'll get married in five days. Here's the betrothal gifts. I'm not getting married. Silly girl, a woman must get married. He's good looking, I heard they are buying a new boat. Huihua. Can you watch my stand for me? Sure. I'll be right back. How much? Thirty cents. Each or per kilo? How much? A dollar each. Damn! A price hike? Give me five. Xiong, aren't you going to bargain? It's just a little money, go on... She's quite good looking. Let me take a look. Selling sugar cane is a hard job, why don't you go be a hostess? You will earn more, and have nice clothes to wear. And if our Brother Xiong takes an interest in you, you don't have to work anymore. Pretty girl. Xiong, what about your fiancee? Be smart. He spent so much on betrothal money, she must be really pretty. Way prettier than the sugar cane girl. Right. Wearing lots of jewelry, and serve Brother Xiong. She must obey. Right, or she'll get her ass kicked. Brother Xiong, will you be so harsh? Why not? I'll lose face if my wife doesn't obey me. We won't be able to stand it even if you could. Right. Don't be mad, I love you. A secret rendezvous! We must report this. Where? Got them! Who is it? This is way out of line. Bitch. Beat her! Slut. Shameless! This is insane! Me a slut? I just want to get pregnant, and you call me a slut? I want to bear my husband's child, and you call me shameless? We're married. Why is it a crime for us to see each other? What's wrong with a husband meeting up with his wife? It isn't my fault the customs being so orthodox n' all. Shameless! The village chief is here, he'll take care of this. Right...he will take care of this. We must keep our tradition. If everyone breaks the rules, then what are the rules for? Right. Your woman has done something wrong, you should teach her a lesson. Beat her! Beat her! Beat her! Go on! Hurry! Teach her a lesson. Come on, beat her! What are you waiting for? Hurry up! This is the rule. Go on. Beat her! Hurry up! You saw that? Repeat that on your wedding night. Xiu. I know what you did with your husband in the room. Like that, huh? I don't get it. You and your husband were doing it so secretly, and so was Meizhen and her husband, doing that so secretly. What's the fun? Tell me. You're not married, you don't understand. I don't understand? I know it all. Alright then, I'll get married. Huihua... Looks good? Leave us. Yes. Huihua. Come here, I've found you a good family to marry into, I'm very happy with the arrangement. If he touches or asks you to take off your pants... remember and pretend to put up a fight; Then he'll tell his mom, and they will know how well I've taught you. And then you'll just let him do whatever he wants. Just lie there, bear the pain, don't scream. Come on, eat up. Xiaocui is heartbroken. Not just her, all his girlfriends in the city. They claimed that they are going to kill themselves after they heard that he's getting married. Lower your voice, she can hear us. Don't worry! I don't give a damn. She's not in charge of me. Let me drink to you, Xiong. Cheers. This is your wedding banquet, and this time... next year, your son's first birthday banquet. A year? I don't think so. Only in ten months' time. Cheers! You know what I think? The wife is like a pig, must be fertile and bears me a few sons. Right. Let Xu takes a look at her ass, and he can tell whether she'll has a son or daughter. Talk less! Then we should go take a look. Be my guest. Not bad. How much did you spend? Zhang of the neighboring village boasts about that his wife wore eight belts. They are all very tight. Tell me, how many belts are you wearing? Don't let me lose face. Are you a deaf or a mute? I can count myself. You better have eight. The sugar cane girl. Shit! Don't be sad. Sugar cane girl, strip... You heard me? Strip. Are you going to strip? Shit! What's the matter with you? You ran home so soon? This is ridiculous. Don't be angry, mom. We can teach her. She's way out of line. I'll go talk to her. You keep saying the same things, what husband? You picked him as your son-in-law, I didn't pick him. I want to throw up when I hear him. Stop it. Listen, no wonder his parents are scolding me, I've tried so hard to find you a good family. Everyone is so envious of you. A new built house. You will be a madam, wearing all the jewelry. All you need to do is to bear a son. And you sneaked back home so soon. Take it if you want. I did well in school and you made me quit, and... though brother fails every time he's precious for you. You're biased! You love him more because he's your son. That's what my mom taught me. And that's what Xiu's mom taught her. It's the rules. You are you, Xiu is Xiu, I'm me. What's the different? Of course it's different. You... Shit! All you knew was asking for money. How did you teach your sister? Hasn't your mom taught her about the wedding night? Brother Xiong, don't be so angry. Huihua is a kid, take it slowly. Take it slowly? What about my ear? So rude. We're just married, how will she act in the future? Brother Xiong, you can teach her. She's too young. Do you know she escaped? I warn you, If she doesn't come home tonight, your whole family will be in trouble. Don't worry, Brother Xiong. I guarantee you'll sleep with her tonight. I've told you I don't want to eat. Stop it, Huihua. You must serve your husband after marriage. And your mom and brother took the betrothal money, you must get married. After the ceremony, you're married. You don't understand me! Even you! Eat something. No. Come on, you have to eat something. I'm sure there's a way Come on, be good, eat up. Listen to me, we'll deal with it after we've eaten. Huihua, what have you done? How could you treat you husband like that? I can do whatever I want. That's my business. We took five thousand dollars from them. How could you do this? Are you nuts? You're nuts! Stop it... Get your butt over there tonight! You must sleep with him tonight, or you'll be sorry. It's the customs. It won't be a custom if we can change the rules. You'll be the victim if you go against it. We'll see how it goes. It's all your fault. I wouldn't get married if not because of you. Listen, bear another night. Girlie, your brother said you don't know what to do. No problem, I'll show you. Come She's a country bumpkin, she doesn't know. We'll show her, come on. Where are you running? I'll show you. I'm getting a divorce. I've divorced your son, I'm free. What's a divorce? I don't know. Hell, they don't know what's a divorce; So uncivilised! What do you mean? You aren't coming back? We're divorced, I'm not going back Come and go as your please? You must be joking. What happened? Your daughter is clueless, and you tolerate her, this is insane. I don't plan on going back anyway. What do you want? Tell us. No manners! How could you say such things? Return the betrothal money, plus damages. Alright, how much? Five thousand. Sure. Shit! A daughter behaves like her own mother. Let's go. Mom, l... We've lost our reputation because of you. It's not my fault. So your husband's scolded you, what's the big deal? I've spoilt you. Give me the betrothal money then, and I'll figure something out for the rest. That's enough. I'll go to your husband's family with you to apologize. And stop talking. Don't get up. Sister-in-law, we met just the day before; How come you're so ill today? I'm getting a divorce. I can't take it, I want to... I understand, I'll give you the betrothal money. Go get a divorce. Huihua, the money in the red pack is the family's, your five thousand dollars betrothal money is in there. The green pack is my own money, safe keep it for me. You can use it when my son gets married. Huihua. I've had enough, and I think I'm coming to an end. You're still young, take care of yourself. Go! I will be fine. What are you doing here? That's my money. no one can take it. Bitch, it's the family's money, how could you give it off like this? Have you gone nuts because you're sick? Shit! Sister-in-law. Listen, no one gets a divorce in our family, if you obey your husband, he wouldn't have an affair. She's really loyal to you, but you're still sleeping around. Look! How you've tortured her! Don't you have any conscience? She is overworked, and gets beaten up by you. It's none of your business, brat. You...I'm warning you. If you don't behave, I wouldn't let you get away with it. What do you want to do? Shut up! And you! Just 'coz you're sick don't think you can do whatever. You don't have the right to hand out our money! Did you hear me? I'm talking to you! Did you fucking hear me? Are you alright? Be strong, Huihua. Don't get humiliated like I do. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. What about her? Not her. She's better. Breasts are too big. Butt is too small. This one...she looks like Gong Xiaoli. Only thinner. And her... Mom. she looks good. Mom, where's sister-in-law's money? I'm picking a new wife for your brother, don't bug me. This one is good, she looks fertile. Mom. These three are quite nice. Mom, give me back my betrothal money. Your brother has lost his wife, and your nephew has lost his mother. I've a lot on my mind. Do me a favor, go back to your husband's, bear a son. No! I'm getting a divorce, I must get my betrothal money back. The money is for your brother's wedding, it's not for you. That's so not fair, mom! We are both your children! Why do you only think for him? He's a man! That's why. You can't compare to him. You're a woman too, aren't you a person? Get out! I don't want to see you. I just want my money back. You can't get a divorce, go back to your husband's. I won't. Then don't ever come back again! Don't worry, I won't. I can't believe her. Never mind... Xiu. Xiu. There's only the two of us from now on. What happened? I don't know what to do without you. I have strength when you're by my side. What happened? Don't ever leave me. What do you think? It's nice. Are you pregnant? Don't tell Huihua. Why not? I don't know, I can't tell her. Then she has no idea about your husband's application for you to move to Shenzhen? Xiu. I'll leave on the afternoon the day after tomorrow. You won't come back from Shenzhen? Not too often, he said he misses me. Do you miss him? Xiu. Are you leaving for good? You're going to Shenzhen with your husband? Don't be silly. Do you want to go? I worry to leave you here by yourself. Don't worry, you go ahead. Go! I will be fine. Are you sure, Huihua? Yes. When are you leaving? Tomorrow? Is it tomorrow? Really? I'll go pack now, I'll visit you tonight. I have so much to tell you. Goddess Mazu, I had a pledge with Xiu. We vowed as sisters to be man and wife, we'll live and die together. We won't be ungrateful to each other. You were our witness on that day. But Xiu has forgotten her vow. She lied to me, she'll follow her husband to Shenzhen, and leave me by myself, on my own. Goddess Mazu, you've always been very fair, why would you leave me alone this time? Do you think it's fair? There's no point for me to live on. Xiu. If we can't be together this life, we'll be together when we're dead. Please understand. Huihua, I've bought lots to eat. We're still sisters, Huihua. Let me drink to you. Take good care of yourself, Huihua. Please don't have any silly ideas after I've left. Write to me often, me and my husband will come back to visit you often. I understand. I like you the most in this world. Only you'll like and love me. I will never forget you. Do you remember our vow in front of Goddess Mazu? Yes, we vowed as sisters to be man and wife. We will live and die together. We will live and die together. Huihua, I'll be thankful of you all my life, and I thank you on behalf my child. You're pregnant? Really? I don't want my baby to grow up here, I don't want an arranged marriage for my child. My child should decide for his If not for you, I'd never... have the courage to leave this god forsaken place. And my husband drinks to you. He said you're very brave. You go against conventions. He has lots to learn from you. See! My child's kicking me! I hope to have a daughter, who is as pretty and brave like you. What's wrong? I'm scared. Of what? I'm not sure, I'm just scared. Remember we tried to learn to swim? I was eleven, you were ten. We had cramps in the sea. I saw the cliffs by the beach. It seemed so far away, I thought I couldn't make it. And you encouraged me, "just a little further..." That's what I kept thinking, "just a bit further..." And then I forgot everything, and we lied on the beach. Huihua. You are still keeping this? Do you remember what it means? Yes, I want to be with you. I like you. And this one? Someone's peeping at us. Go now before I change my mind, and I won't let you go. Huihua, I talked to Guang on the phone this morning, no matter we're having a son or a daughter, we'll use the name "Huisheng" This is for Huisheng. Safe keep this for me. Mom. Huihua. Mom. I know you love me, sorry to have you worried. Come in, sit here. You've lost weight, Huihua. Mom, you should wear a new outfit. I'm off now, take care of yourself. Huihua, serve your husband well. Xiu. Wish we could vow to be man and wife in our next life. The bracelets are our tokens, me in you & you in mine. Goddess Mazu as our witness. You live in my heart forever.
