The information you'll hear is of a confidential character/ l'm a psychology expert dealing with emergency situations/ An hour ago your father hijacked a plane with hostages/ What father? Your father, Lev Markovich Morgulis/ l'm listening/ Alexander Lvovich, you have to talk to him/ What shall l talk with him about? l don't remember what he looks like/ We'll pick you up/ Hello? Hello? Wait! Hello? Some nightmare/ This story began a few days before May 9th, in that distant legendary time when my grandmother was a young girl and Victory Day was still celebrated on the Red Square/ Life was hungry and very hard then/ Depression and apathy reigned in society/ Only the government was never depressed, running in shorts and caps and playing soccer against the State Duma/ ln those distant times people didn't know how to manage the climate, the ozone holes were open and the harmful cosmic radiation greatly affected the mental state of our people/ Horrendous killers wandered about Moscow, for years waging wars among themselves/ Serving in the police were people without compulsory university education/ Parents were afraid to let their kids go to school/ And Russia was desperately searching for her own way which she now found/ The number of veterans of the war against Nazis was dwindling each year/ The patriotic education was deteriorating/ But they were loved and respected as before, including veteran lvan Dyakov who had shot down twenty Nazi airplanes and was a true national hero/ Oh, oh, oh/ lt's not nice, Vanya/ Some veteran/ Don't hide behind your hat/ An old man, at his last gasp/// What's your name? - Vova/ - Did he hit you? Yes, he did/ What do we do? We should discipline him/ You from your side, and we, so to speak/// Vova, open it/ From our side/ Wait here/ How are you doing, Vanya? All right? Bloody shadow capitalist! Comprador! Why are you so happy? Look at yourself! Look at yourself! You're disgracing all veterans! Why do you look so happy? Morgulis is coming for the parade! - Really?! - His stepdaughter called/ - He wanted to surprise us/ - That bloody emigre! His flight arrives in two hours/ You must meet him/ - l've got an emergency situation/ - No problem, Mitya! Damn! Don't you see? l look like a monkey in a cage/ They've torn my jacket too/ How can l go to the airport in this jacket? lt's nothing/ We'll fix up your sleeves/ - Let's fix up your sleeves/ - l can do it myself/ - Comrade, can l talk to you a second? - Yes/ Well, it's one year to three years/ But you can pay by exchange rate/ Vanya! - Where're you going, Vanya? - To the garage/ Take my car/ l don't need your damn car, you speculator/ l'll be ashamed of driving it/ You've got absolutely crazy at your age! Rallying on the squares! Your Sonka called every morgue and hospital! lvan Dyakov beat the Fascists not alone, but with his crew comrades: navigator Dmitri Kilovatov and gunner-radio man Lyovka Morgulis/ ln the period of painful reforms, Dmitri Kilovatov headed the Public Foundation of Army and Sport Veterans in order to help other veterans to adjust to the new life and lift from the bottom of a deep lake a shot-down Soviet plane for the sake of educating the young generation/ But behind his back most improper dealings took place at the Foundation, about which Dmitri Kilovatov, of course, knew nothing/ Here, drink/ Got tired, too? Excuse me, aren't you Morgulis, by any chance? Yes, by chance l'm Morgulis/ Are you going to watch your parrot? Zhorik, leave the lady alone/ Or you'll end up in a soup/ What an insolent bird! - So much aggression/ - lt's in his blood/ His mother comes from the Kea family/ ln New Zealand they hunt sheep/ Office of Nichiporenko/ Close the door, girl/ Don't you see he has a visitor? l can't, lvan Afanasyevich! l'm at work! Hush! Yourjob is a piece of cake! You're not flying a plane/ Let's drink to victory/ lt's sacred/ Tell me, Alyoshka, who is the best pilot in the whole wide world? You are/ Nice/ But you're lying/ The first pilot in the whole wide world is Valerka Chkalov/ And the second? You are/ Smart boy! Smart! - Well, and the third? - Gagarin/ No/ Lyovka Morgulis/ Look, Joseph, this is Morgulis/ Look, you may never see him again/ We got struck by lightning/ Everyone shit in their pants/ And he performed a landing/ - Shalom/ - Shalom, Joseph/ Joseph, you must become a hero like him/ You're going to Moscow to see your friends? - We go back on the 9th/ - Too bad/ The boy won't see the parade/ We got involved with that travel agency/ May they all go to hell! Are you from the agency too, Madame? No, l'm on a quite another business/ Well, all right, Lev Markovich, we'll see you/ Goodbye/ So you're a flyer? A little bit of a flyer, a little bit of a raider/ You're joking/ Lyovka! Vanka Dyakov is rolling to you! Come and meet me! Lyova! Lev Morgulis! l'll explain to you later, girls/ Lyova Morgulis, where are you? Dyakov is coming to you! Where're you? Vanya, l'm here! Oh, Lyova! What a dude you are! The state of Russia/ A madhouse/ lt's been twenty five years! You son of a bitch! Twenty six/ How did you know? Your stepdaughter called Mitka/ l became sentimental/ And you didn't change a bit/ Almost/ What did you think? There was a rumor that you got paralyzed/ And what is this? Zhorik? Zhorik the Second/ His dad died/ You said they live to be a hundred years old/ Some are not so lucky/ Are you going to leave the plane, sirs? As fast as we can manage, girl, as fast as we can manage/ And if you're nasty, we won't leave at all/ Oh, it's quite heavy! How is your Sonka? Did you marry her off? Of course not/ That cow/ And our Mitka has absolutely gone off his rocker/ At his age he became a New Russian/ Bloody comprador! What are you looking for, Lyova? The bottle/ What is it, Lyova? l'm blind, Vanya/ l got blind/ The shell fragment turned the wrong way/ l wanted to hang myself, but/// the rope broke/ But l got used to it/ Vanya, where are you? l'm here, Lyova/ When the friends got reunited after a long separation, all the house residents came out to meet them and express their gratitude to the heroes who had saved them from the Fascist plague/ Why did you put yourjunk here? Let me drive out! Am l supposed to wait until you unload? Are you crazy or what? You whined and begged that we allot you a garage/ Your pensioner's garage is around the corner! Why the devil are you parking your buggy here? Mikhalych, don't you see? How could l leave that bottle? But l'll be honest with you/ l've lived in the same building with you for 10 years, yet l can't tell whether you're a good man or so-so/ Or to put it straight, just shit! Come on, Lyova/ - Hello/ - Hello/ Come in/ You got no hands or what? Slava, get up! Father is here/ Get up! All right, stop fussing/ We're in a mess as it is/ lt was just a momentary weakness/ Forget about it/ You can't imagine what he may do/ - He isn't going to kill you/ - He is/ He's got a personal gun/ He's so hot-tempered/ lt's quite possible that he'll shoot you/ You came here for the notebooks/ No, you're our extracurricular dean/ lf he offers you a drink, take it/ lf he lashes at Communists, you do it too/ lf Democrats, you lash at them/ - Did you serve in the army? - No, thank God/ Don't say that/ You did serve/ ln Regiment 154, as a radioman/ Hurry up! Are you asleep or what? Here, don't drop it, for God's sake/ Come on, Lyova/ Come on in/ Come in/ Oh, my God/// Uncle Lyova! Uncle Lyova, my dear! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You got as tall as myself! My little tomboy! - Some tomboy! 80 kilos! - Stop it/ Oh, my God! Only don't make a tragedy out of it/ Uncle Lyova is blind/ Yes, such an ill luck/ l wanted to hang myself, but the rope broke/ But l already got used to it/ That's all right, Lyova/ And who's that character? Who is he? Dad, l'll explain everything/ l don't know him well myself/ He teaches physical education/ Slava, a private, Regiment/// 154/ A radioman/ So it's a radioman now/ lvan Dyakov had a daughter, Sonya, a late child/ Dad, l need to have a serious talk with you/ Twice Sonya presented her suitors to her father and twice he had her hopes buried, for the suitors weren't worthy of her/ The first suitor wasn't worthy of her, because he was a botany teacher and a butterfly collector/ And the second one was a divorced tenor/ ls that you who's a divorced tenor? Yes, me/ We're now at the building of the nonprofit charitable foundation of army and sport veterans/ Behind me is the office of its chairman, a war hero and a fearless pilot, a participant of the Victory Parade, Dmitri Sergeyevich Kilovatov/ How is this possible at such an old age? And what does this foundation really do? St/ Pete, it's our sacred duty! Do whatever you want/ We'll stand behind you! Yes, yes, it's Leningrad! A silly, haughty old man, but deft/ lt was hard to keep an eye on him/ He signed contracts with laundries that made discounts on servicing the families of veterans/ Well, there was even something touching about all this/ Shutov/ Don't get distracted/ - Hello? Hello? - Yes? Hello? lt's New York! Can you hear me? lt's the Yid-Masons calling/ - Who? - The Yid-Masons! Well, well, l'm listening, comrades/// We've got problems/ We have whiskey, but no soda/ Vanka says it can go with plain water, but l think we'll get poisoned/ Lyova! l bought it! You the Yid Mason! Lyova! That's my war buddy came to visit! - Mitya! - Lyova! We just arrived/ Waiting for you/ The food's on the table, but we're not starting without you/ Where's my gun? l'm asking you, bitch! Where did you hide it? Stop putting on a show/ Slava has left/ You wandered somewhere at night/ My colleague paid me a visit/ So now they call it a colleague? When did he come? Last night? - You bitch! - Stop it/ lt's the last time l'm asking: where did you hide/// hide/// Search for it yourself/ lt's in one of the boxes/ - ln which box? - l don't know/ Go on, search/ l can't hear anything/ Will you talk to Mitya? Yes/ Hello? Well, we're here/// Why was he yelling? Don't pay attention/ He's looking for his gun, the schizoid/ l'll show you the schizoid/ l'll show you the schizoid! l wish l had strangled you with my own hands in your cradle/ l'm sick and tired of him/ Yes! Hello? l wasn't talking to you/ You're just like a sissy/ Our children, the flowers of our life/ Bitch/ l said l wasn't talking to you/// He did tell you? All right, let's not make a tragedy out of it/ He looks fine/ He brought his parrot/ Finish up your briefing session and let's go drive around town/ We won't be waiting too long, you know me/ All right, then/ Take care/ We're waiting/ - The shoe doesn't fit/ - lt's for the other foot/ Here, Lyova, your shoe/ Here's your shoe/ Stupid Vanka! Guys, l feel like we three together are only 70 years old/ - But actually we're 300/ - And a glass of beer/ Dad, where are you going? - What d'you mean, where? - Yes, where? Where am l going? Outside, to have a smoke/ Don't even think of driving/ Sonya, who do you think we are? We're grownup people/ Yes, tell me, who does she think l am? Quiet, quiet/ l don't know/ Yes, of course/ Look! What do you want me to look at? When did you see me driving being drunk? Tell us, Sonya/ You see, guys, how l live? She won't believe a word l say/ Look below, there's our field over there/// Artillerymen, Stalin gave the order/// Someone came down a hillock slope/// One-two, one-two! Oh, look at those dorks! One-two, one-two! Foot up! One-two, one-two! Company, halt! One-two! At ease! - We'll bust them/ - Wait/ Oh, l've never felt better/ Fall in! Don't pull me by my pants, better give me your finger/ No talking in the ranks! Forward march! Go! Go! Where're you going? Get in/ Go, go/// Greetings, comrade pilots! Greetings to you, Comrade Marshal of the Soviet Union! You greet well/ Serving the Soviet Union! Congratulations on the holiday of the great victory! That's him in Canada with his wife/ They're separated now/ He's a greatjoker/ Yes, he loved to joke/ He could step out to buy cigarettes and come back many years later/ l was a plain-looking friend of Anya Krymova/ They had a madly romantic love affair/ She was married/ And l delivered to him her love notes/ Then she left her husband/ But he never married her/ And in 1953, he lived here, in this room, sleeping on a folding bed/ He was just expelled from the academy/ Oh God, l heard that story a hundred times/ How he was expelled from the academy, how they punched somebody up/ l always stood behind his back/ And one day/// he suddenly patted my knee and said: ''Oh, you/// ///gray duckling/'' And he stepped out to buy cigarettes/ Stepped out/// just to buy cigarettes/// How old and feeble they've become/ Father sleeps before the TV set/ He believes he's always right/ How could mother live with him for years, with his war and his stories? As if there has been nothing else after that, neither mother, nor me, nor any other life/ Those jerks, standing here and letting no one pass through/ People just amaze me sometimes/ - Absolutely amaze me/ - Take it easy/ We promised to the priest/ Fine wheels/ l'd buy it for some 300 bucks/ Write the telephone number/ - lt'll crash for sure/ - l don't think so/ - One hundred/ - One hundred fifty/ - lt's a deal/ - Come on/ Oh, bloody hell! Come on, come on/ Go! On the holiday eve, Muscovites deemed it an honor to invite veterans, present modest gifts to them and give moral support in their hard life/ Comin' in on a wing and a prayer Comin' in on a wing and a prayer Though there's one motor gone We can still carry on Comin' in on a wing and a prayer/ What a show, what a fight Yes, we really hit our target for tonight/ How we sing as we limp through the air Look below, there's our field over there With our full crew aboard And our trust in the Lord We're comin' in on a wing and a prayer/ That's about it, in general terms, dear comrades/ Now it's your turn to fly and guard the peaceful life of our cities, our villages, our wives, mothers, children and grandchildren/ - And great-grandchildren/ - Yes, if they come to be/ And now, comrades/// Just briefly about the international situation/ Vanya, maybe we shouldn't? Perhaps some other time? But should there be any questions, who'll answer to the young generation? You? l got a question/ Right/ Go ahead, comrade, shoot/ Comrade Major, it's said that you taught flying to Cosmonaut Alexeyev/ That's right/ They said on the radio he got problems/ No problems/ The orbital station's connecting hatch has been warped/ Tolya's a great cosmonaut/ He'll open it/ - Did you get a burn? - No/ Sorry, l couldn't size it up right/ l guess l put it on the edge/ Stop worrying/ She's got plenty of those cheap cups/ lt's the jet lag/ You haven't got used to it yet/ Look, you've stained your pants/ Never mind, l've got another pair/ ls it day or night now? lt's night/ How are you doing there? Like in a hedgehopping flight/ You live alone? With blind people/ lt's okay/ We live well/ We're all friends/ We save on electricity/ lt's okay/ Look, Lyova/ Don't go back/ We'll manage here/ Only Mitka and l are left/ l don't know this city anymore/ l don't know people/ - You got a daughter/ - You got a son/ - Sashka? - Right/ Have you heard anything about him? No/ Though wait a minute/ About 10 years ago, l met Anya in the street/ Fat and heavy/ Just before her death/ She rushed from me, as if l was a devil/ As if l was to blame for what happened between you/ Forget it/ God has punished me/ Look, Lyova, why don't you go to a synagogue? They say we have a top-class synagogue here in Moscow/ There're a lot of Jews there/ Go and confess/ Do you remember Pavlovsky from the 2nd Squadron? A little man/ - He was funny/ - Yeah/ Remember how l played a joke on him on the front? l said, ''Our Commissar is a sorcerer, he can cast a spell and you'll get a letter from your wife/ He made me get three letters already/'' l've been dreaming him lately/ Like the late Masha and l are lying down, sleeping/ And there he comes/ l say to him, ''Pavlovsky, l got no letters for you/ l give you my word, none/'' And he doesn't say anything/ And such a sorrow grips me/// l just feel like screaming my head off/ But l don't want to die/ No, we don't want to/ Vanya/ Shall we last another couple of years? Of course we will/ Only we have to live those years so, as they say, that we wouldn't be foolishly ashamed/ Yes/ Hello, dear son/ Maybe, sonny? No/ Hello, dear son/ Hello, dear son/ Go on/ So/// Come on, go on/ What's then? l don't know what to write/ Write it like this: ''Hello, dear son/ Writing to you is your shithead daddy who had abandoned you and your late mother for the sake of debauched life/'' That's what l would write/ Well? Lyovka Morgulis was loved by many of his frontline girlfriends and other peaceful women/ But most of all by Anya Krymova who got pregnant from him/ Why are you all dressed up, like Lyovka's parrot? Well, the occasion calls for it/ Why don't we stop at a shop and buy him the electronic chess? - What? - Why not? Lyova said he went to a Pioneer Palace as a boy/ That pioneer will send us tumbling down the stairs, mark my words/ But soon he met his frontline comrade Lyubka, nicknamed ''Normandy-Neiman'', and Anya turned him out for good/ So Morgulis saw his son, Sashka, only two times/ The first time as a baby, when Sashka peed on his head/ The second time, before his leaving, when he bought Sashka a machinegun firing with ping-pong balls/ How do l look? Clean shaved? You look fine, Lyovka, just fine! Look, wait/ You/// sit here for a while/ We'll check the situation and come back for you/ Mitya, give it to Sashka/ Perhaps he's hard up/ No/ - Why not? - lt doesn't look nice/ You think so? All right, l'll send it by mail/// - Who's there? - Does Sasha Morgulis live here? Yes, here/ Then open up, only don't swoon/ - He's timid/ - Fatherless/ One face/ Just one face! A bit skinny, but the blood will get its way/ Where're you going, Sasha? Here's your Sasha/ l'm not Sasha, l'm his wife's brother/ Fortunately, his ex-wife's/ And l can't wait till our things are moved out of here/ Get away, beast! Don't you touch my cat, bastard! Or l'll break your neck! So you're his brother-in-law/ l'm no one's brother-in-law, l'm waiting for the movers/ What does he do? He's having a crisis/ Setting stoves in restaurants/ - Fathers! - Yes? You can kiss my arse! Well, shall we go? We'll drop by some other time/ And whom did he expect to see? The great chess player Botvinnik? lvan, keep your tongue in check/ ln check, in check/// teacher/ Wait, guys/ Once again and in detail/ What details? We went up, rang the bell, a boy opened/ We asked for Sasha, he said: ''Sasha has left for two days/'' And who are you? We said we were friends of Sasha's mother/ His mother, Anna Vassilyevna, is dead/ We said we knew that/ ''And l am,'' says the boy, ''Sasha's wife's brother/'' He's married, Lyova/ And Sasha, does he work? Of course he works/ As a/// skilled worker/ He sets stoves/ Yes, stoves, fireplaces/ Today it's a greatjob, Lyovka! A fine boy/ - What else? - He has a cat/ lt means he loves animals/ Animals/// What if l invite him to the parade, guys? No, l'd better not/ He'll see that l am blind, and things like that/// No/ All right, let it be like it is/ l am/// l'm glad/ Thank you/ Oh, and here Christ appeared before people/ - Who is there? - lt's Ninka, a lonely fool/ Hello/ What if l sell it? And buy a bike/ Don't oversleep the rehearsal/ You don't oversleep it yourself/ Let's go/ Oh, Mitka! Oh, Vanka! Oh, Lyovka! Hi, Ninka/ Going home? You know what? Take me/// To the foundation/ 100, Zvyagin's here/ - How are things going there? - We got him/ Good/ - The money's in his pocket/ - How much? About fifteen hundred/ That's bad/ Add a zero/ - Done/ - Over/ Let's get rolling/ Walking on Donskaya Road, l was fucked with a big board/ Can't a person, bloody shit, Just take a walk in the street? Vanya! Vanya Dyakov! - What? - Maybe your Kilovatov has died? No bloody way/ Don't count on it/ Tanya, is your hubby still alive? Why? You want to marry me? - Would you agree? - Of course l would! l envy you, Morgulis/ You can't see all this/ What would you like, comrade veterans? Tylenol, valerian, nitroglycerin? Poison/ Will you massage my temples, child? You should be ashamed of yourself, comrade veteran/ What can l do, child? l've been feeling some agonizing attraction for nurses since the war/ Attention, comrade veterans! Fall in! Don't move/ Now in profile/ Don't move/ - One! - Easy/ l see you're shaking/ Why is Mitya being late? He'll be here/ Our previous report was ready to go on the air, but as is the custom in our holy Russia, the obvious often turns out to be a lie, and the Deputy Chairman/// There he is! And we're looking for him everywhere/ ///Shutov was killed while trying to put up an armed resistance/ And our so-called hero and so-called war veteran, pilot Kilovatov was apprehended by a sheer chance, carrying in his pockets about 15 thousand dollars in cash/ What do you mean, ''so-called''? What does it mean? What did you mean? Explain it to me! lt's only the top of the iceberg, but its main and most important part leads to the top brass of our army/ Hello? Chorus of the NKVD veterans/ We're from infantry, my friend, ln summer it is nice and warm/ We're through with war to bitter end, We're through with war to bitter end, We're through with war to bitter end, Take your greatcoat, let's go home! Stepanyuk's listening/ Not ''let's go along'', dear girl, but ''take your greatcoat, let's go home''/ Once again/ Listen, are you sure he'll come? l sent him cards on all the holidays/ To Stepanyuk?! That scoundrel from the SMERSH? You forgot how he was torturing us a whole month? He could sentence us to death by shooting, but he saved us/ Saved us/// lt was just a lucky coincidence/ Vanya, there could be no lucky coincidences in the SMERSH/ Oh, come on, Lyovka! Hawky, it's 29 minutes now/ Exactly in one minute you approach the one wearing glasses and say, ''Here's something for you/'' Give him the note/ And leave without any explanation/ Got it? Do it/ Well/ Nikitin/ 930-1 7-00/ Extension 3/ What does it mean, ''3''? lt must be an intercom/ Through an operator/ lf he can, he'll help/ And he can/ Burn/// the note/ - The matches/ - Burn it, quick/ Just a sec/ Where did we get the money? This money is legal/ - Brought from America/// - This is my money/ This is Lev Morgulis, he brought it, this is American money/ - Fifteen hundred dollars/ - And we're told it's 150 thousand/ - Nikitin's office/ - Hello? lt's Zvyagin/ - He's still busy/ - l'll wait/ - l'll connect you in one minute/ - All right/ My name is Zvyagin/ When my back begins to itch, it's a sure sign that things are going to end up bad, a 99 percent chance/ l could get rid of Kilovatov without second thoughts/ But l couldn't call Nikitin and say: ''Let's get rid of Kilovatov, because my back began to itch/'' You know what l mean/ He threw a chair at the special force unit/ Yes, that's how he is, very trustful/ l told him: don't get involved with those bandits/ - They set him up/// - Nikitin's listening/ At last, Valera/ l've got veterans here, Stepanyuk sent them/ - What do they want? - lt's about Kilovatov/ Throw them out/ Got you, Valery Borisovich/ All right/ Already done/ Well/// That's it/ - What d'you mean, ''that's it''? - That's it, fathers/ Let's call it an investigation error/ - They're bringing him in/ - Bringing where? Right to our courtyard/ You can wait there/ You mean he's/// free? l mean he's free/ Oh, dear, dear man/// l'm not going anywhere without him/ Let them bring him here/ What are you doing, Lyovka? He told us right in our face/// He doesn't trust me/ - No/ - All right, we'll bring him here/ Don't listen to him! Please forgive him/ He's lost his bearings in that abroad of his/ Are you crazy? They'll change their mind/ Come on, let's go/ Come on, come on/ Excuse us, please/ Thank you very much/ A big Russian thanks to you/ Thank you/ Let's go, quick/ Thank you/ You know what you did? You/// Thank you/ ln those times our country was ruled by mafias: small, medium-sized and big/ Mafia is a foreign word, it's no longer in use now/ There were two biggest mafias: the generals' and the prosecutors'/ The mafias were fighting for spheres of influence/ For this they needed deputies/ Deputies were killed by other mafias, and there were not enough of them/ Since their work was stressful and medical service was very poor, anyone could become a deputy, even a serial killer or an orchestra conductor/ When the generals' mafia proposed its last candidate, while the prosecutors' had none left, the prosecutors' mafia decided to compromise the generals' one in public opinion/ That's what they needed Dmitri Kilovatov's foundation for/ There were 24 generals among its founding members/ Those generals bought themselves palaces, dachas, swimming pools and a park of automobiles enough for a small town/ Well, son/ What about that foundation? lf they go to court, l'll have to resign/ That's no good/ What if we bang that flyer? lt's pointless/ They got the list of the founders, but they don't make it public/ Who's our contact man? - Nikitin/ - Put him through/ Yes/ We serve in the inland troops/// Nikitin's listening/ Hello, son/ What's the score? 30:15/ Where are you? l'm at my dacha, son, where an old man like me should be/ But why are you spoiling our life? Bandits walk on the loose in Moscow/ Spies of all kinds/ People are afraid to go out/ And your boys busy themselves with some nonsense/ The generals/ Valera, don't play games with us, old men/ Just say it straight/ - What do you want? - What do we want? Third territorial district/ And the generals had to withdraw their candidate/ Boys! Boys! Son/ What do you want, old freak? We told you already/ No, son, l'm from Stepanyuk/ He's an old dolt, your Stepanyuk/ He won't be able to hold on, Vanya/ Oh, what kind of people are you, Jews? Why are you burying him alive? l carried both of you over the front line, and l'm fine/ lt's all right, Lyovka, we'll do it, by hook or by crook/ - Where did they go? - To the garage/ - What's the matter, Nina? - What is it? What's going on?! Come on, Nina, stop it/ Come, come, stop it/ Haven't you got used, living in this country, to being thrown in prison? Take it to them/ Oh, hello/ May l talk to you a sec? Do l look like a normal man? You seem to be/ Then why don't l take a sledge-hammer and crush that Pobeda to smithereens? Your father has a garage, but he always parks his car/// He thought it was too late for you to go anywhere/ l'm a resident of this house too! And l can come and go whenever l like! l don't have to ask the permission of that moron! Dad/ Give me the car keys/ Do you want me to take your blood pressure? l will have your cane sandpapered/ Dad, l beg you/ lt's all useless/ He wouldn't get splinters then/ Why? Let's get people sign a petition, hire a lawyer/ Uncle Lyova, you know better, you lived abroad/ Tell him/ - Don't you see? - What do l see? l can't see/ Get up, bastard, when a prosecution investigator's talking to you/ Who gave you the idea, bastard, to deliver 20 train cars of vodka instead of/// baby food? l didn't know anything about that/ Dmitri Sergeyevich, why are you covering up your army? You yourself didn't make any decisions/ l did/ l decided everything myself/ Oh, don't kid me! Maybe we'll just write it down?

There are/ But he's on leave now/ Well, he doesn't interest us/ Help yourself to the cake, don't be shy/ l came about Dmitri Sergeyevich/ He sends his regards and hopes to see you soon/ Men, there's such a metamorphosis/ We promised to the priest that for a month after/// - After Christmas/// - After Easter/ Yes, after Easter/ We'll behave ourselves, no grass, no messing up/ We held out for 10 days/ - Eleven/ - Why?
