"...nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." Man: No cruel punishments? I'm afraid not, your honor. Continue. The 13th amendment: "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States." For god's sake, who says so? Our beloved founding fathers, your honor. Counsel, I am no longer "your honor." I am "your dishonor." As for our founding fathers... To hell with them. I am your slave. Ralphy's been bad! Ow! Come here. - Ralphy's been bad! - That's right. Get down. Really bad. Give it to me. Please, harder! Aah! Harder! Police! Freeze! Don't shoot! Put your hands up now! Man: And once again, our oath is sacred. Upon it rests the very stability of society. In this respect, it is with the utmost confidence that I address you this evening to support the appointment of not only a fine jurist, but also of a man of whom I'm very fond. I have watched Richard Elliot Miller grow in our profession much as I have watched my own children grow in life, first, as a law clerk, later, as an attorney, and finally, as a colleague and friend. When I think of him, three words come to mind: Honesty... Decency... Integrity. I assure you, Mr. Governor, my fellow judges, dear members of the judicial council, I can think of no one more qualified to join the ranks of our distinguished supreme court. I thank you all very much. - Governor Powell. - Yes. Considering the recent rejection of judge sinclair Lamar, do you expect any kind of static from the council regarding judge Miller's confirmation? None whatsoever. But hadn't you labeled Mr. Lamar a sure-fire candidate at the time? Yes, I may have. But that was before I became aware of his personal problems. I assure you there will be no surprises here. Mr. Lamar argued that his rejection was politically motivated. The appointment of a judge to the supreme court is a very serious matter, one that transcends party lines. The judicial council has always been impartial and above criticism. - Governor Powell... - Justice manderville... Please answer the question. So... How does your butt feel, a few weeks away from sitting on the big bench? Don't jinx it, Rodney. With Powell and manderville kicking the council's ass I'd concentrate on golf for the next few weeks. That's what sinclair thought. That unworthy gambler? Lamar was Powell's man, but not manderville's. You're the perfect compromise, sweetheart. She's as beautiful as she's right, Richard. To Mr. In-between, the perfect compromise. Elizabeth. Oh, hi, Arthur. Richard... Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Rex Roberts, advisory member of the judicial council. Mr. Roberts is also the executive director of the state Christian community project. Judge Miller, chief justice manderville has spoken most highly of you... your irreproachable moral standards, strong family values, and uncompromising views on the crucial issues. We welcome men like you on the bench. Actually, Richard, you are one of the few issues that we both agree upon. It's awfully dark in here. How'd it go? Your father was a real knockout. I better get going. No, wait! Vinnie and I have something to tell you. We signed a lease this afternoon. We're moving in together. Oh, honey, what's the big rush? Finish school first. And you, get a job! I have a job. Petitioning door-to-door to save the rain forest? - Please! - Richard. What does he make, $20 a week? $100 a week? $125. I'm sorry, Donald Trump. I have a job. Waitressing. Listen up, you two. Life isn't all fun and games. Do you want a decent future? You have to have discipline. You have to have principles. You're at an age, what you decide to do, you'll be doing for the rest of your lives. And you have no right to squander your future. We'll do whatever we damn well please! Female bailiff: The people versus Gabrielle Mitchell. Judge: Counsel? Your honor, according to her statement, the accused, miss Gabrielle Mitchell, admits that on September 16th, she was found with Mr. Ralph MacKenzie, a court of appeal judge, in a bawdy house that she runs. Now the file shows that miss Mitchell has previously been found guilty of solicitation and to wit, she has been fined $200 and $500 in the past. Now, since these penalties do not seem to deter miss Mitchell, the people now demand three months in jail. Judge: Mr. Roselli? Your honor, I have very little to add except that three months does seem rather excessive for a victimless offense. And furthermore, my client deeply regrets her actions and plans to take up a more wholesome profession as soon as possible. Yes, yes, I see. Miss Mitchell, as per section 12, paragraph 3.6 of the penal code, the court finds you guilty of operating a common bawdy house and sentences you to 14 days in jail. What? We're gonna fight this. Female bailiff people versus Peggy Fletcher. She actually kicked him out. Her husband is fooling around with a prostitute. It'll be all over town. It is all over this town. Come on, it's happened before. Nelson, pass the rolls, will you? I know. But a judge...Has to set an example. You sound like a goddamn fortune cookie. Look, I'm sorry. I just can't sit around while Ralph's neck is on the line. For Christ's sake, we all graduated together! What is it you'd have US do? I don't know. You're the judges. There must be some way to handle this. Yes, by the book. Gentlemen... How are we all doing today? Well... I guess I'll leave you men to your mussels. I hate that smiling prick. Listen, your prick would be smiling if it hung around his girlfriend. Nelson: How do you know? Well, Ralph introduced me. She hangs around the bar. Come on. Don't tell me you've never seen her. Congratulations, Mike! You made the big time. "Judge caught with his robes down." Tsk! Such a pity. Nice girl. Your buddy Fred said you two looked like you knew each other. - Biblically speaking. - Listen, what I do... the d.A. Wants a word with you. Mike: I told you... I met her in a bar, once. End of story. Ah. We were informed that you were tipped off by an anonymous caller. Yeah. A woman. - Was it... - Gabrielle Mitchell? Couldn't tell you. Maybe. Why would an anonymous woman call you at home? That's where I live. Any other tips? What is this, a grand jury? Just answer the goddamn question. Frank. Frank. So, Mr. Botkin... Any other tips? No, just MacKenzie. Well... I've also been informed that... Miss Mitchell... Comes from New Hampshire. Like a million other people. Concord. Concord, New Hampshire! Look, we grew up in the same neighborhood. Only back then, her name was Stacy. Stacy Mitchell. I lost track of her. I didn't know what happened to her, until the other night when we bumped into each other at the bar. That's all there is to it. I swear. Uh-huh. Well, Mr. Botkin, we are all on the same side. But if you want my advice... Keep your dick in your pants, and steer clear of hookers for a while, hm? That's a gift from heaven. After your testimony, believe me, they'll cough up the dough like good little boy scouts. What's wrong with you? I'm not supposed to be here. So we got the wrong judge. How could I know? You set me up, you son of a bitch. Oh, come on, Gabrielle, please. Get me out of this shithole! Two weeks is not gonna kill you. Then you do the time! I would if I could. Do your thing in court, and when you come out, you'll get your share. I'm warning you, roselli. Don't fuck with me. I'm the only one in town who hasn't. Don't worry so much. Retirement is just around the corner. Just make sure you scare the shit out of them. God! We have no choice, Richard. We must be firm, or we lose control. You can't help him. Mr. MacKenzie and Mr. Fitterman are here. Um, I found something. I was hoping for something a little more...discreet. Elizabeth is still young. I'm sure she enjoys a little spice in her tea now and then. Thank you. Show them in. Well? Well what? The district attorney cannot withdraw the charges. The whole city is waiting for this trial. I'm not asking for that. What are you asking for? Richard, honest to god, I thought it was a massage parlor. When they busted the place, she was just giving me a massage. Please, tell me you believe me. Plead guilty, Ralph. Save yourself a hearing. He'll be removed! What about Claire, my son... my two little girls? I think you're just going to have to explain everything to them. Christ, Richard, he's your friend! Harvey, Richard is about to join the supreme court. The judicial council is scrutinizing his every move. There will be no controversy here. So that's what this all boils down to: Your advancement! You have disgraced our profession. You have shamed every man and woman who wears these robes. That, Ralph, is what it boils down to. Remember, when you look back at this, Ralph, there's god's strength in our weakness. Do you think that I was the only one that saw her, huh? You think I was the only one?! Well, there's a larger picture here. Just keep that in mind. Female attorney: Miss Mitchell, did you know the police were tipped off by an anonymous caller? Gabrielle: No. The accused claims that when he was arrested you were giving him... a massage. Were you indeed giving him a massage? No one pays $500 for a back rub. Then would you please tell the court why the accused paid you $500. Why don't you tell me why they sent me to prison? Miss Mitchell, please just answer the question. For a piece of ass, your honor. - Order. Order! I will caution you to refrain from making extraneous comments. - Counsel. - Your honor. Miss Mitchell, had you ever met the accused, Mr. MacKenzie, prior to the night of his arrest? Of course. He was a regular. You mean "regular customer." - In other words, you knew him very... - objection! Leading. Withdrawn. Gabrielle: Well, I'm not withdrawing anything. Ralphy was just one of my many regulars. Counsel, can you control your witness? - Miss Mitchell... - I've had judges, lawyers, politicians... hey, I'm warning you, you are in contempt. - You'd be surprised... - enough! The list of my conquests, your honor. You and you, in my chambers, now. Court is in recess. What's going on here? Nothing. I had no idea, your honor. I want all of her comments stricken from the record. Now, hold on. I mean, the extraneous comments, okay, but the rest stays. Do you have any more questions for miss Mitchell? That depends on what's on the tape, your honor. Paul, you want to cross-examine? Thanks. I've heard enough. Well then, will you excuse me? I'd like to take a look at this. Gabrielle, recorded: So, how's the missus? Thank you. Don't worry. It's all there. Shall we begin? Richard: Well, we can't tell it's you, but that's certainly miss Mitchell. "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States." For god's sakes! Who says so? Our beloved founding fathers, your honor. Counsel, I am no longer "your honor." I am "your dishonor." As for our founding fathers... to hell with them. I am your slave. Ralphy's been bad! He's been bad! I've been bad. Aah! Aah! I'm bad... I'm sorry, Ralph. Give it to me! I'm sorry, Ralph... Please, harder... I'm sorry, Ralph... Harder! Police! Freeze! Judge Miller, will the cassette be released to the public? No. No comment. Why did judge MacKenzie switch his plea to guilty? No comment. Judge Miller, did you read the list? - Excuse me. - Who's on the list? Will you make it public? I will act in the best interests of justice. Judge Miller, what about the best interests of the people? Man: Heard about the fun and games in room 304. Hey, Bernie. She's got nothing, Richard, couple of names on a piece of paper. Good. Then i'm worried over nothing. Well, anybody can make up a list. You and I could make one up, put the president's name on it. What about... The governor? Just a... Just "a few names on a list." I wouldn't let that fall into the wrong hands, Richard. Ooh, Richard! - Whoo! - All right! Last, but not least. You really shouldn't have. Oh, Richard. It's so beautiful. Thank you, Richard. Happy birthday. Hmm... Should we leave you two alone? So what do you think, Richard? Rodney. Champagne? I saw Ralph yesterday. Uh-huh. He's been removed from the bench. Can't eat. Can't sleep. Claire's filed for divorce. His children won't even talk to him. How many of your friends' lives you planning to wreck? Well, nobody is above the law, including judges. What's that supposed to mean? - Back off, will you? - You're not going public with that list? You're not gonna let that slut boss you around! Maybe I should decide for you. Calm down. I'm warning you. No. I'm warning you. You do anything stupid, I'll break every fucking bone in your... Rodney! You've had too much to drink. Wife: You know, Ralph should have known better. Well, he's history, and I'm the one left with the damn list. Why get entangled in all this mess? Just hand it over to the authorities. What, and turn in my buddies, my colleagues? What if it turns out to be a hoax? Well, then Rodney wouldn't have been so jumpy, would he? Mmm... You like? I miss your touch so much. Richard: Come here. Richard! No, stop. Richard, stop. What? - He's watching US! - Who? - Stop. - So what? Man: If she doesn't stop, she'll drag US into hell. As long as she's locked up, she can't harm US. Miller can. Nah, he doesn't have the guts. Huh, you don't think so? He'll sacrifice anything for his goddamn principles. This guy's a missionary! He's Mahatma Gandhi in guccis, for Christ's sake. I say we straighten him out. Salman: He's a judge... And he's also your friend. Of course, he was also Ralph's friend. I don't care who he is. I just can't sit here... And let him drive US into... - governor Powell? - Yes, come in. Sure hope the governor treats you well. Ah, young blood. Send him in. She's quite the find, Mason. Can't you think with your other head for a change? Come on, she's just a secretary. Yeah. And the other girl was just a whore. Well, if it ain't "Mr. Clean." Come and join the club, Nelson. I got a call from roselli. Ah, the pimp. He wants $500,000. He has US all on tape. Like Ralph. Roselli: I also got one of these at the office, addressed to miss Mitchell. Your colleagues are trying to scare US. They're getting nervous. I don't know. Maybe. I've got a family. I can't take chances. Neither can I. That's why I called for this little... tete-a-tete. Cognac, your honor? What do you want from me? I want you to tell your friends to watch their tempers and to cooperate like good little foot soldiers, or they'll end up prime time just like good old ralphy. I don't think you know what you're getting into. Come on, we all know there's no bigger coward than the lawyer caught with his pants down. No one touches my reputation, my job, and above all, my family. Do you understand that? That's exactly the attitude that'll get your friend ray Martin into trouble. Smile, your honor. We're just like partners. Excuse me, judge Miller. Miller: Look, if you guys are from the press, I said I wasn't gonna... ugh! Ow! Oh, my god, Richard! Don't move or we'll fucking blow his brains out! One name, and you'll swallow your own. Oh, Richard! Any man, from the highest official to the lowliest beggar found cavorting with a woman of easy virtue deserves to suffer the pains of purgatory along with judge MacKenzie. Suppose some reputations are destroyed in the process? Judges and politicians are not ordinary men and women, they are the apex of social order, and thus, must answer to the highest standards of moral decency. I say, and I'm sure you would agree... Make the list public, then come what may. Richard: Load it... You cock it, and it's ready to fire. You want to try it? No, I've got it. Why won't you let the police handle this? And see the thing blow wide open? It already has! Listen, Elizabeth, this isn't about a couple of judges diddling a hooker. This is about power and politics. No, Richard, this is about our family, our lives. Exactly, our family, our lives, our friends, everything that you care about. It could all go up in smoke if I turn this list over to the police. What do you mean? Richard, is there more I should know? Well, I think that Roberts is using the Mitchell scandal to shake down the governor. You mean he's on the list? Oh, Richard. Whatever you decide, I will stand by you. Just be careful. Dear god, when I heard what happened, i...i... Maureen, I don't want to talk about this, okay? Not right now. All from the media. I want you to get Arthur on the phone for me. Actually, he'll be out of town all day, but he suggested that you join him and Mr. Roberts at the driving range tonight at 5:00. I'm going to take Elizabeth out to dinner, 8:00 tonight, seafood. Oh. District attorney salman is in your office. Richard: Apparently they keep the evil spirits away. Oh? Then that makes me a good spirit. How are you, Barney? I should be asking you that question. Richard, I swear to you, those people who roughed you up will be apprehended. What can I do for you? Did you happen to see Rex Roberts on TV last night? Yeah, I did, as a matter of fact. He seemed like a man with a mission. Now, Roberts is as cautious as they come. He wouldn't want that list made public unless it served his interests. And, Richard, the governor... Is very, very upset. Tell me about it. What does that mean? Well, look, I should be in court. So, let's just cut to the chase. I did not reveal a single name. Who, then? I don't know. Maybe you should be looking for somebody who is... Who's bitter, who's depressed... Someone's whose name has been dragged through the mud. Ralph. You'll have to excuse me. Yeah, sure. Have a good day, Richard. Vinnie: Kathy, it's me. I found a stove and a fridge for $100 including delivery. Call me. Bye. Uh...hi, there, judge Miller. Man: One snitching pig down, more to go. - What was that? Judge Miller, it's Gabrielle Mitchell. I've been trying to reach dom roselli. He was supposed to visit me today. I'm worried. Could you please go by his place or send someone? His address is 1550 pleasant street, apartment 305. Dom said I could trust you. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Richard! Janitor: A judge ain't no police, you know? Well, if there's a problem, we'll call the police. Jesus, what the hell is going on here? It wasn't locked. Mr. Roselli? Mr. Roselli? I never had trouble here before. Never. Mr. Roselli? Mr. Roselli, you here? Whoa! Ugh! What the...? Agh! Huh! Severe cervical dislocation, jugular and carotid arteries cut clean... Looks like one of his clients didn't approve of his fee structure. Yeah, another inch and a haircut and we'd go bowling. Razor blade? Yeah, something like that. Nice, real nice. Hey, frank. Sorry I'm late. Think he's going to make it? Pete gave me this out front. I'll take care of it. It's a tie clip. For Christ's sakes, there's something in his throat. Oh, Jesus Christ, the poor bastard swallowed his tongue. Not quite. Someone cut it and stuffed it in there. Miller: "You'll swallow your own." Those guys who beat me up, that's what they said... "If you talk, you'll swallow your own." I can't think of anyone. Fitterman, Stevens? Grant, woo? Powell, kowalsky? Did it ever occur to you that you might have pissed these people off? I don't know what you're talking about. Who's this... ray Martin? Haven't a clue. I suppose you've never heard of a blow job, either? Your buddy roselli was tongue-tied too, until somebody loosened it. Are we done? Stacey, i'm... We're trying to help you. Are we done? Let's go. Oh, by the way, we're going to be screening your home videos this afternoon. Whatever turns you on. Harvey: What are you saying? Come on, Harvey. You're hardly a dispassionate observer. You think I'm stupid enough to... no, no, I think you and the others are desperate, and you'll do anything. Look, Richard, I don't know who killed that son of a bitch, and frankly, I couldn't care less. Well, how about the death threats, or those two goons you laid on me? "Couldn't care less?" I swear I had nothing to do with that! Yeah, right. Roselli taped all of US. If we can get those tapes, that bitch will have nothing. Forget it. The police have them. Tapes can be erased. Goddamn it! And what about the judicial process? Or don't you care about that either? Trust me, Richard. People aren't going to give a rat's ass about the judicial process when they see the governor's butt plastered all over the 6:00 news! Judge Miller, a word? Detective Decker. This is Harvey fitterman. Fitterman... "Best criminal lawyer in town." As a matter of fact, I'm due in court. Recording: Hey, Kathy, it's me. I found a stove and a fridge for $100, including delivery! Call me. Bye. Uh, hi there, judge Miller. Man: One snitching pig down, more to go! You hear that? What, the beep? No, just before it. One snitching pig down, more to go! Isn't that the elevator bell? Bingo! Thank you, Maureen. So...the call was made from the courthouse. Sometime between 4:22 and 5:15. After your daughter's boyfriend's call, and before miss Mitchell's. Anyone else see this, besides your wife? No, not to my knowledge. Well, whoever killed roselli has got to be the same person who sent you this death threat. Nelson: An ox tongue! I can't believe you did that! He didn't release the list, did he? You almost had him killed! So the guys got a little carried away. You didn't have to threaten his family. That wasn't me. All right, who's the stupid son of a bitch? Let's have it. Who killed him? - Easy! - You didn't put out a contract on him. - You're not that fucking stupid. - Excuse me! Gentlemen, I said easy! I was in roselli's apartment building the day he was killed! I, uh... he wanted to see me, talk business. So i... so I went. But, uh, he didn't answer. The police just called me. Looks like the janitor identified me. They have all our names... And the tapes. Only the names. Let's just say, the tapes have been cleaned. You're kidding? Gentlemen, it's miss Mitchell's unfounded allegations against your word. That'll shut her up! I can't believe this! Do you realize what you're doing? You'd rather end up like Ralph? I don't want any part of this, I only saw her once! Nelson, whether you like it or not, we are all in this together! Hey, we're only protecting ourselves. Exactly. Are you sure... You never entered that apartment? Okay. I did get in, but he was already dead! Careful, gentlemen, I will not always be there to mop up after you. Guard: Well, what did you do, they letting you out three days early? Haven't a clue. Get me out of here. Ahhh! Bitch! Ah! What exactly do I have to do to get police protection? Get busted again? Look, I told you. If you want to file a complaint, we'll be happy to oblige. My life's in danger! What, a strong young girl like you, afraid of a golden-ager? I can't believe this. He attacked me! Look what he did! Allegedly. Frank, she didn't slam herself against the wall. No, no, no... We're not done with this yet. Do you mind? What's going on here? Why are you doing this? You're going to regret this. Asshole! She needs protection! Then get her some rubbers. I got orders. What the hell do you think they were doing with that hidden camera, making a documentary? She didn't exactly pick on the village idiots. Tough luck. There's nothing we can do to help her. Hey... Don't try anything heroic. Or you'll end up writing out parking tickets. Do I make myself clear? Yeah. Whatever. Ha ha! Strong dope for your throat. Hello. This is he. What? When did this happen? He attacked her? Oh, I see. Right. Not a word, Bernie. Yeah, thank you. Mom, are you sure I can have this? As long as you take good care of it. It's baccarat. Richard, how much is this baccarat worth? Oh, don't throw it away, dad! I need it. Dad, come on. What's with you? I just got a call. Arthur committed suicide. What? They found him hanging. Oh, no. Oh, Richard. I'm so sorry. I'll get that. I want to see judge Miller. Dad? I ran into your friend, ray manderville. The next son of a bitch who lays a finger on me will regret it. I have copies of all the tapes. I'm sure the press would love to get their hands on them. This time I suggest you pass the message to your friends. What the hell is going on? How did she get our address? Well, for one thing we're in the bloody phone book. What's this ray manderville business? Stop interrogating me. She was in our house! Look, she and roselli had been trying to use me to... to hold off their victims. But they were mistaken! And now, she's... she's panicked out of her head! Liz, don't be so upset. God, dad! She has a right to be! You stay out of this! Botkin: Hey, Stacey. Your boss change his mind? No. Wanna come up for a drink? Considering what the last one got me? I'm sorry. That's all right. So why'd you ask me to bust you? For one thing, you gave me your phone number at the bar. Look, I was scared, and I thought if something went wrong that you might help me. Thank you. Oh, shit! Looks like they came from the roof. Oh, god! They didn't find what they were looking for. They think they can just... Just use me and throw me away? Just... get rid of this? Does anyone know about these? Damn it! Look what they've done! They're gonna pay. This is not gonna go away! They're gonna pay every last fucking penny! Yes, then you can retire in a body bag. Enjoying yourself? Read it. Read it! Allow me. Fitterman, Rafferty, Powell, woo, Anderson, MacKenzie, Grant, Simmons, salman, kowalsky, Stevens, Martin... But no Miller! How about that? Sorry to intrude, Elizabeth. No problem, Bernie. Hello, Bernie. I'm terribly sorry about Arthur. I know you two were close. Forensics found this in roselli's apartment. It's Mitchell's client list. They also tracked a tape for every name. Except... this one. "Ray Martin." What about him? Well, we feel that ray Martin killed roselli and grabbed his tape. We also feel... That "ray Martin" is justice manderville's alias. He tried to strangle Gabrielle Mitchell, didn't he? And when we found roselli, his neck was broken. Arthur was 72 years old, for god's sakes. How could he take on a man like roselli? When the police went to his office, even with the door closed, they could hear the elevator bell. Are you saying that he's the one that sent me all these death threats? Roselli's tapes have been erased. Well... We have enough evidence to close this case. It's the right thing to do, Richard. Dad, what's up? Uh, nothing. Oh, let me give you a hand. Hey, dad, you've been working out. Botkin: Around 15 video tapes. Mostly judges and politicians. A live broadcast? Sure, that's even better. No. No tapes before the press conference, okay? Monday morning, 9:00 A.M. Right, your studios. Of course she'll be there. Once they make the headlines... They won't dare to lay a finger on you. Believe me. Priest: ...The father and the son... And the holy ghost, amen. Congregation: Amen. Our brother Arthur, will endure in our hearts as a model of justice, righteousness, and hard work. But more importantly, we shall remember him, as a faithful husband... A loving father... - Who considered... A loving father who considered his family to be of the utmost priority in his life. Let US now pray for his soul. Mitchell's giving a press conference. She's gonna make the list public. I want to talk to you, but not now. No, now! Priest: Light... happiness... Peace... May almighty god bless him. The father and the son and the holy spirit... - Amen. - Amen. I'm gonna see you back at the house, okay? Take the car. Have you ever met that detective Decker? I've spoken to him briefly on the phone. Why? I found him snooping around justice manderville's office the other day, doors all open, and no warrant. And? He was trying to see if he could hear the elevator bell from there. He thought justice manderville left that call on your answering machine. Well, you never know. In fact, I do know. Justice manderville couldn't have left that call. He wasn't anywhere near the office that day. He was out of town attending a conference, and he finished the day at the driving range with your husband. Thanks, Maureen. It's open. Aw, Jesus! Why didn't you tell US right away about the copies? You said you had her place searched - with a fine-toothed comb. - I did. That bitch! You shouldn't have been fooling around with her in the first place. Listen to me, goddamn it. I'm not married, and I don't have kids. I've always paid for my women. Now some bitch wants to take me to the cleaners, and I'm supposed to sit around and let her get away with it!? I don't owe her anything. I already paid her good money. Good evening, gentlemen. I'm Brenda. I'll be at your service. Get your pussy out of here! Now! Go on. Miss... I'm deeply sorry. He didn't mean that. Come on, Harvey. Apologize. Come on, do it. I said, do it. Okay, okay. I'm sorry... "Brenda." Now get the hell out of here. Go on. Now, what are we gonna do? We should've gotten rid of that whore a long time ago. Harvey, look at me. Don't you do anything stupid. You go home and sober up. Gentlemen, I think that, uh, you can get an injunction to stop this press conference. What if we don't? Botkin: "From your slave, ralphy"? That's kinda daring. Yeah, you can toss that. Any plans, um, for tomorrow? Oh, I don't know... Fly to some faraway island. Yeah, I could use a little sun myself. Actually, I was thinking more like Antarctica. I'll tell you what... I know this great little ice cream parlor in Concord. That was in another life. You know... You've always had this light in your eyes. So... So pure. I think I'll take that shower now. No, he hasn't arrived either. No, I've no idea. Huh. Yes, of course. I'll let you know. Okay, you're welcome. Okay. 'Bye. Gabrielle: Hey, Mike? I was just thinking... Mike? Mike? Mike? Mike? Mike? Oh! Mike? Oh! Take it easy. There's someone in the house. Did you call the police? No. Can I come in? I need to talk to you. Detective botkin's here. Yeah, I know. We... We ran into each other. You shouldn't be frightened of a judge. What are you doing? Where would we be if people stopped trusting US? Richard? Give me that. No. Give it to me! You know, no one's watching, and yet... yet I feel this... I feel this power surging through me! Feel how hard this is. Feel it! That's a good girl. You do as you're told. We'll get along fine. Do you know what a contract is? - Yes. - Do you? It's an agreement that binds two people together like a promise. You broke your promise! - The tape. - The police have it. The copy, or I'll do you like I did your lousy pimp! Where is it? There! - Where? - The outlet. Oh! Ohh... - You fucking... - Richard! Th-they tried to kill me. What are you talking about? To shut me up! Put that down, Richard, please! You don't understand! They tried to kill me! I found the newspaper, Richard. You lied to me. You don't understand. I'm doing this for you and for Kathy. I'm warning you, Richard! Drop it! Don't you point that goddamn thing at me, like I'm the devil, because I'm not! She is! I'm the law! You're sick, Richard. Stop it. It's over! What about our family? Our name, our home! Aren't you willing to fight for that? There's nothing left to fight for! You've destroyed everything... You son of a bitch! Liz, I love you. I love you so much. Don't let this little slut destroy our lives! You have the power to act! Use it! Use it now! I'll never let you get away with this. Don't worry! Don't think about it! Just pull the trigger! You can do it! We're a team, you can do it! - No! - What are you waiting for? Let's end this thing now! Yes! End it! - Shoot her! - Richard, no! Shoot, shoot, shoot! Oh, no! Oh, no... Honesty. - Richard Elliot Miller. - Decency... Fitterman: Mr. In-between... Integrity... Honesty... Richards: We welcome men like you on the bench... Elizabeth: Your father was a real knockout... Miller: I love you. I love you so much... Miller: You shouldn't have been fooling around with her... Richards: ...Irreproachable morals, standards... Gabrielle: The next son of a bitch who lays a finger on me will regret it! ...no right... Miller: I will act in the best interests... Botkin: Ray Martin... Miller: I'm sorry, Ralph... Fitterman: Mr. In-between. The perfect compromise. Miller: There's god's strength in our weakness... What'cha got for me, Bob? Looks like the wild west in here. Nah, just lawyers. Area's been sealed off. Nothing's been touched. Take your time. I'll hold off the hounds. Mmm. Gabrielle, recorded: Come in, Martin. Cognac, your honor? So how's the missus? We made love last month. Oh. Peeping Tom watching? Mmm. Where's our little devil? He's here. Hi, ray. Make yourself comfortable. Miller: Okay... Woo: In the words of michelet: "A magistrate, in the course of his duties, must strive for justice worthy of his name; one that is not paid for or bought; but that emanates from the people, for the people." It is with great pride, but also with a special thought for the late chief justice, Arthur Philip manderville, that I accept this honor of joining the supreme court. Let me assure you that during my mandate, I shall fulfill my duties, so that the public will have confidence not only in the judicial system, but so too, in the honesty, integrity, and decency of those who administer justice.
