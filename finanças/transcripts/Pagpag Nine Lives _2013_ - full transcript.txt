--== McEphie ==-- [suspenseful music playing] [thunder rumbling] [woman sobbing] [melancholy music playing] [thunder crashing] Auntie? How dare you show your face here? You're the reason he killed himself! [screaming] Get out of here! Get out! [sobbing] [indistinct chatter] Hey! Wait, girl! Did you come straight home? Oh, well, it was the mother who made sure I left and went straight home. [scoffs] Didn't I tell you not to go there? You even went in a red dress. You know you can't wear that to a wake, right? Tsk! You're so stubborn. I've never been a believer in superstition. -[horn honks] -Hey... oh, Brian's here. -I have to go, girl. -All right. Just relax. Let's talk later, okay? -Okay? Okay, bye. -Yes, take care. [sighs] [melancholy music playing] [sobs] [eerie music playing] -[eerie music continues] -[indistinct screeching] [creaking] -[gasps] -[glass shatters] [gasping] [screaming] [distorted on speaker] Have you brushed the stench of death away? If you haven't, it might bring you bad luck. [distorted laughing on speaker] [distorted on speaker] Pagpag, Nine Lives. The Horror House. Who is with you? You can scream, you can run... -Hey. -[phone chimes] -Let's go. -...but you can never hide. Experience the scariest adventure of your life. Pagpag, Nine Lives. -Guys, let's go inside! -Just wait. [distorted voice continues] I'LL BE HOME IN A BIT, DAD. Come on, come on, Rico. -Let's go? Come on. -[girl] Hey! [chuckles] [distorted voice on speaker continues] [disembodied voice] Who is with you? -[boy] Don't leave me. -[girl] Move faster! I don't want to! [indistinct maniacal laughing] [girl] Cedric, I don't want to be here. -[boy] I thought you wanted to-- -There, there! Look! [all scream] [old man] Come in. Welcome. [indistinct creepy laughter] [disembodied voice] Who is with you? [creepy laughter continues] [all exclaiming] -[girl] Rico! -[boy] It's moving! [girl shrieks] Rico! Cedric, I don't want this anymore. -Let's get out of here. -Enough, please. [clamoring] [indistinct growling] [girl] I've had enough of this place. [boy] Hey, wait for me! [monkeys chittering] [screaming] [growling] [screaming] -[boy] Let's go, let's go. -[girl] Come on! Hurry! -[screaming] -[Cedric laughs] That's what you get for being stubborn! [shrieks] Let's go, Rico! Cedric, what the hell? [cabin creaking] Sorry, sorry. -What are you doing? -I'm really sorry. -[girl scoffs] -[boys laughing] -Follow her. -This way, guys. -Cedric! -What are you doing? Cedric! Cedric, those guys just touched me. -[laughs] -[disembodied voice chanting] Why did you harass my friend? Really? I didn't. What do you mean you didn't? -You liked it too, didn't you? -[boys laughing] [grunts] You jerks! [all clamoring] Bring it! Come on! [clamoring] [eerie music playing] [man] Cedric, how many times do I have to tell you that losing your temper will get you nowhere? And that? Did you have that checked? We're not going to talk about this again. And don't you dare give me that attitude! Give me your car keys! You're grounded! [keys clatter] [keys jingle] Keep a close eye on Cedric. -I already took his car keys. -Yes, sir. Don't let him leave the house. [suspenseful music playing] [tires screech] [romantic music playing] Hey, Leni. If you run out of flowers at the funeral home, call me again, okay? Of course, Ms. Ningning. -Is this okay? -Yes. Here. -Thank you and take care. -I will. -[honks] -[shrieks] [woman] She almost got hit by the car! Hey! Are you crazy? You drive as if you're on the expressway! And you walk as if you're inside a mall. You jerk! [grunts] Jerk! -Hey! -[bangs car] [grunts] Hey! [romantic music playing] So? Why are you looking at me? [stammers] Me? It's you who's looking at me. How dare you? You almost killed me. Then I'm sorry. Apologize properly. What? Do you want me to kneel? Is that the proper way? Fine then. Here, I'm kneeling. -Is this good? -Stop that. Get up! [indistinct chatter] Here. Sorry. [grunts] You can keep your money. You know what? Do what you want. [romantic music continues] [Leni] This is my stop. [man] Thank you. BEEF BONE MARROW SOUP Why is this closed? [soft piano music playing] [metal clanging] [eerie music playing] Macmac? [eerie music continues] [door creaking] Macmac? [screaming] [boys laughing] Boss, that was classic! You dare to laugh? -That wasn't funny! -It was funny. [snickers] Are you both drunk again? Hey, correction. We're not drunk. We're just tipsy. [both laughing] And you? Aren't you supposed to be at the soup shop? There are no customers. How will there be any if it's closed? Leni! Leni! Leni, come on. -Have you eaten? -I already had dinner. We haven't eaten yet. -[exclaims angrily] -We're hungry. -I wish someone would die. -What? Boss, she wants you dead. No! What I meant was, those who are meant to die should die already so we will have work here. Don't worry, Leni. God will have mercy on us. [chuckling] Don't worry, I'm going to pray for someone to die. [both laughing] Hey, it was just a joke. -[laughing continues] -Macmac, come with me upstairs. Macmac, what are you drawing again? Here. Draw something else, okay? -That was good. -Whatever. -You're all just too much. -What is this? -Don't you dare leave. -Grass? -Let's have some beer. -I can't go with you -if you're drinking. -I have some chips, too. -It's so dirty! -We have beer and chips. -Come on. -You know these beers are... That's too much. I think you love your car more than me. -Of course. -What? Are you serious? Am I laughing? Do I look like I'm about to laugh? Fine! What is all this dirt? [girl] Hey, sis! Are you coming? -Sis, what's wrong with you? -[girl] Do what you want. Come on, aren't we going to party at your house? -Let's go. -[girl] Party on your own. I just remembered, I have an audition... What's wrong with you? -You're too serious. -[upbeat music playing on radio] Look, we're just messing with you. Are you sure about this, Leni? Marcelo, take a look at this. Let me see. That's right, Leni. I don't believe in rumors. This is the first time we're going to the wake of a person I didn't embalm. We're not the only ones who do embalming in this area. It can be done at the hospital the person died in. Such a pity, isn't it? They should've gotten our complete package instead. At least we'll earn some money. But, Leni, my drinking friends just told me -that the guy was possessed. -I heard that, too. Maybe we shouldn't do this. But aren't you possessed, too? Possessed by laziness. You can do what you want, Leni. -Marcelo, where are we? -Wait, I'm still looking for it. -Party! -Yeah! -[all whooping and cheering] -[dance music playing] What? What is it? What's your problem? [exhales] Let's go home. Let's talk. What are we really? Nothing. "Nothing?" But we're dating exclusively. Exclusive? Me, exclusive? [scoffs] Hey! Don't tell me you're dating someone else. [sighs] Hannah, whatever you're thinking, whatever you think we have, don't take it seriously. We're just supposed to enjoy ourselves. Relax. And enjoy it. -Enjoy this! -Hey, Hannah! -Hey! -[Ashley] Hannah! Hey! -Ouch! -[boy] What's up? [dramatic music playing] [eerie music playing] [eerie music building] Can I stay behind? -Marcelo, that's enough. -[snoring] This is work. We need the money. -[thumps] -[groans] -See? He's drunk again. -[snoring continues] Wake him up and follow me inside. Macmac, stay here, okay? You can sleep while we work. Stay there. -[snoring continues] -[car door slams] [Lucy] Are you Leni? Uh... My name is Lucy. I'm the wife of the deceased. [chuckles] Oh. Hi, Ma'am. Good morning. [birds singing] [grunts] [rooster crows] [eerie music playing] There you are, ma'am. It's done already. He now looks like he's just sleeping. Well, it's a package deal then. As your burial organizer, I'll take care of everything until your husband's buried. Just pay me personally. Thank you. You must really love him. [melancholy piano music playing] I would do anything for my husband. That's how much I love him. We were so poor back then. -My husband's all sweaty. -It won't take long. [Lucy] We were happy as a couple. [birds singing] Someday, my love, we will be able to afford that house. [Lucy] But we became happier when we were blessed with a child. [baby crying] He'll stop crying soon. [Lucy] But tragedy came soon after. No! No! [Lucy] Our child died and our house burned down. Hey, Roman! [Lucy] My husband saved me from the fire, but he was severely injured. And now he's dead. It's a shame that he never found out I was pregnant. Roman! With the little money that we saved... we were able to move here. [melancholy music playing] He never recovered? Our love became stronger. But Roman got weaker. There were too many complications. The medicines weren't working. It might have turned into skin cancer. [sighs] That's what happened. My condolences. Thank you. -[gasps] -[Leni] Huh? Uncle. Uh... Ma'am Lucy... Uh... not to be disrespectful, but don't you want your husband embalmed? His body will smell. [whispers] Let me handle this. -Don't you worry. -Get out now. My husband won't decompose. [eerie music playing] -[motorcycle engine revs] -[broom sweeping] -[Eva] Here's my fare. -Thank you. -[Uncle] That's the place. -There's so much to clean. What are you whining about? Clean that, too. -Yes, I'm doing it. -Hey! This is a wake! Don't you know that you're not supposed to sweep the floor? What the... Eva, you're here. Come inside. Eva, this is Leni. She's organizing Roman's burial. -Hello, ma'am. -Who are the people outside? They're with me. I'm sorry, I want everything to be in order for a wake. It's to-- It's bad not to follow superstitions. Uh... Don't mind Eva, this is just the way she is. [awkward chuckle] -[whispers] Leni, come here. -What? Uh... Leni, we forgot to buy a car. It's more money for us, too. We're gonna leave for a while. -You and Macmac can take a tricycle. -Oh, no need for a car. Buy a mass card instead. Leni, no need for a mass card. -Oh, okay. Okay. -Uh... Candles. We're running out of candles. -That's right. -We won't be gone long. You and Macmac can take a tricycle, okay? Gas money? Hmm. There's still some gas left. -Let's go. -Come on. Hurry back here. -[rock music playing on stereo] -Cedric, where are we? [grunts] Cedric, I'm sorry. [shouting] Cedric, please! Talk to me! We'll come back tomorrow to change the flowers and bring more food. -I'll just wait for a tricycle. -Okay. [birds singing] Pull over. Let's just go home. Will you stop? Let's just go home! -I said pull over! Come on! -Hannah! -[tires screeching] -[screams] -[horn honks] -[grunts] Help! -Hey! -What the... [girl] Are you both trying to kill yourselves? My car! Hey! [boy] Where are we? [Leni] Jerks! You're crazy! -[girl] A little help here? -[boy] Are you okay? -[girl] Yes. I'm okay. -[boy] Good. Nothing's broken. [Leni] You? You again? You want to run me over out here? Your parents should ban you from driving. Do you realize that you can kill somebody? Do you know each other? [soft piano music playing] -Leni, what happened? -Ms. Lucy... [Hannah groans] Hannah, what's gotten into you? Huh? -Hey, Hannah. -Hey. My stomach hurts. [suspenseful music playing] -[Lucy] Come, follow me. -[Hannah] I'm dizzy. I want to vomit. -[creepy music playing] -[groans] [Lucy] Eva. This one's nauseous. Take her to the restroom. Their car got into an accident. It's a good thing no one got hurt. Go on. Come inside. Is the tow service here yet? Do you see anyone here? -No. -Then there's no one here. [eerie music playing] [grunts] Sorry. [gasps] Are you drunk? [chuckles] -Come, hurry. -Look. Look at this. [creepy music playing] -[groaning] -[screaming] Let go of me. -Leni, wait. Ouch! -Don't touch me. You're hurt. [Ashley moans] -Ashley... -What? Hannah, why? What happened to you? Hey, are you okay? -What are you doing? -Ouch! Your tear fell on the coffin! Don't you know that's bad? -Don't! -[grunts] -And you, too! -[gasps] All of you should leave. Eva, why are you making them leave? These people are strangers. We will go ahead. Our apologies. -Uh... my compact... -Here, take it. [laughs awkwardly] -What was that? -That woman's crazy. -Come here. -You broke a lot of rules. You. Your tear fell on the coffin. And you wiped it off. Don't you know that it's bad to look in the mirror during a wake? And you? Did you think I didn't see that? Give me the bread, give it to me. It's bad to bring food home from a wake. You. Get your wound checked. Eva, don't scold the children. They're not aware of those superstitions. Don't you know? By breaking those rules, you're allowing the dead man's soul to come for you. Uh, I've been organizing wakes and burials for a long time, and I've proven that superstitions are not true. Those who believe in them are already dead. It's bad to break those rules. Don't go straight home, so spirits won't follow. That's enough. Stop scaring the children. Go on, go home. Your parents might be looking for you. -Let's go. Hurry. -Come on. Let's get out of here. What a load of crap. [indistinct chatter] That woman said we shouldn't go straight home. Didn't you hear what Leni said? She said superstitions are not true. [chuckling] So, who's Leni? That's the girl he was with earlier. -So, that's her name. -Oh. -So cheap, seriously. -So cheap? [chuckling] Cedric, did you get her number? -Stop it, Rico. -Hey, that's too much. -I'm getting off here. -Okay, you can get off. -Is she really? -Go on, you can try. Come on, we dare you to get off. [laughing] -Oh, Hannah. -So? Go on, get off. [unsettling music playing] [loud snoring] -Uncle! -[gasps] What the... -It's raining. -You're drunk again. You're overreacting. We didn't come straight home. We stopped at the corner store. Then we drank the rest here just to be sure. You're using superstition as an excuse to drink. [laughing] How about you, didn't you stop somewhere? Leni, did you come straight home? -Hey! -[gasps] [grunts] Leni! Hey! You didn't stop anywhere? Hey. Leni, I'm serious. Did you come straight home? Leni, wait. You should always stop somewhere. What if the spirit of the dead follows you here? That would be a disaster. Leni! Do you have any money? I need to buy more booze. [loud slam] Go on a diet! ♪ It's better to say goodbye ♪ ♪ Than to stay and see me cry ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know these dreams That I've made ♪ -Hey, bro. -Sir, for you. -That's on me. -Thank you. -I'll go ahead. -Okay. ♪ Dreams that I've made ♪ -♪ Going away ♪ -[grunts] -[crowd cheering] -[girl] Nice song! -[gasping] -[cell phone ringing] [groans] -[grunts] -[cell phone stops ringing] What do you want? [crying] You know what I want, Cedric. You. That's impossible, Hannah. You lead me on and now it's impossible? What do you think I am? Disposable? I told you that I'm not the type to commit to anyone. -I'm not like that. -I hate you. -I'm going to kill myself! -[call ends] [bicycle chain squeaks] [suspenseful music playing] That's a good one, bro. Where's the christening? Hey. [creepy music playing] [sobbing] Macmac? Macmac, what's wrong? What? Why? What is this? What's this about? Why are you crying? -[sobbing] -Macmac, what is this? Come on, talk to me. Tell me what's wrong. Macmac, say something. [crying] Macmac, how will I understand if you won't speak? Macmac, what's going on? [crying] Sorry. [Uncle] Marcelo! [suspenseful music playing] [crowd exclaiming] [bystander] What happened? Go to sleep. That's enough. Go on, I'll be right behind you. [Macmac crying] It's because you came straight home. That dead man's spirit probably followed us here. Uncle, I also feel bad about Marcelo's passing. He's just like an uncle to me. But don't blame me for what happened. It's because you're so stubborn. You won't listen to me. There're rumors going around that the dead guy's family is possessed by demons. There! Rumors again! That's what you get from drinking too much. I have credible sources. Did you know... that couple lost a child. They couldn't accept it, so they turned away from God. [crying] No! No! [sobbing] [shouts] Where? [screams] Roman. -Roman. Roman! -Where are you? -Stop it. -[crying] My son! Return him to me. Roman, that's enough. [smoke hissing] [Uncle] That's why it's rumored they made a pact with the devil. Rumor has it that they had to kill nine people in exchange for their son's resurrection. -[grunts] -[moans] -[stabs] -[man] Hey! What's going on? -He's the killer. -Hurry up. -Isn't that Roman? -Follow him. [panting] [sobbing] [both crying] [shouts] Where? What else do you want me to do? Huh? -Roman-- -Nine lives for my child! -What else? -[crying] Roman, that's enough. [both crying] -Return my son to me! -[thunder breaking] Return my son to me! [thunder rumbling] I can't take it anymore. [thunder bursts] [thunder crashes] [baby crying] [both panting] [both chuckle] My son's alive. -[pants] -[baby cries] [sobbing] [both crying] -[man] Roman! Monster! You're a murderer! -[crowd clamoring] [Uncle] But the townspeople cursed them. [Roman] Please wait. -Murderer! -Get out of town! [man] You belong in hell. [Uncle] Their house was burned. [man] Take this! -[flames burning] -[sobbing] [Uncle] Roman got hit. Ever since then, they've been called a family of demons. -[flames crackling] -[indistinct shouting] Uncle, you know what? Of all the stories about that couple, that's the most impossible to believe. [shouting] It's possible, Leni! It depends on who you pray to! It's not only God who can resurrect the dead. You know, if you weren't so stubborn and you had listened to me, Marcelo would still be alive. [Leni] I'm the one who's stubborn, Uncle? You're the one that won't stop drinking. How are we supposed to get out of debt? Better to be neck-deep in debt than buried in the grave. That's because you only think of yourself, while I keep thinking of you and Macmac. You two are my responsibility. You need to get your act together. [slams drink] You threatened to kill yourself. Of course he'd feel guilty. I'm such a great actress. And later, when he sees my beautiful eyes crying, he'll apologize and beg for my forgiveness. Don't you know? All the guys give in when they see me crying. Fine. You've got it made. Oh, my God. I think he's here. All right, bye for now. I still have to go over my lines. Hey, wait! Cedric? I was right. You care for me. So, now, it's your turn to run after me. You even made sure my parents weren't home. Cedric! Cedric. Cedric. [eerie music playing] Cedric. Cedric, come out. What are you up to? [cell phone ringing] Cedric. What's with you? I'm about to drown myself, and you're still trying to scare me? Wait for me, I'm on my way. You're still on your way? -So who is-- -[static whining] -Hey! -[grunts] [screams] [screams] Hannah? -Don't! Let me go! -Hannah! [Hannah yelling] -Let me go! -Hannah! -[screaming] -Don't! [screaming stops] [Cedric] You can't pin this on me. I went to see her because she said she was going to kill herself. We're not saying you killed her. -You sound like you are. -[Paul] Cedric. Ouch! [unsettling music playing] What happened to that? Hannah threw something at him when they were fighting. There! So, you have a motive. Okay, you don't have to answer that. Sir, you can just talk to our lawyer. Let's go. Rico. Why does it seem like you're pinning it on me? -Hey, come on. -Bro, I just told the truth. Believe me. I saw it. You saw what? The corpse, Rico. The corpse from the wake. He was the one following Hannah. What? You know what? Go home. Have your head checked as well. -Hey, hey! -Hey! -Cedric, stop! -We're at the precinct. Hey! -What's going on, Cedric? -You have to believe me. Get inside the car. Look, Rico, I'm sorry about my son. He's tired and confused. [dramatic music playing] Get in. -Are you gay? -What makes you say that? You think Cedric can do no wrong. You like him, don't you? It's not like that, dude. If Cedric kills me next, I swear, I will haunt you. [door locks] Justin? Are you watching me? I knew you were gay. Go watch Cedric. [eerie music playing] [shower knob turning] [eerie music building] Justin, you're being an idiot! [groaning] Ouch! It hurts. [panting] [groaning] [panting] Huh? [water running] [screams] [groaning] [screaming] Macmac. When you grow up, don't become a drunk, okay? You don't want to end up like those two. [yawns] Go to bed. [siren wailing] [panting] -Oh, I'm sorry. -Watch it. Where could he be? Oh, my. He shouldn't have come here. [groans] Hey! Hey! Don't come in, the cops are looking for you. -Where's Rico? -Wait, wait. He's dead. What? Why is this happening? Last night, it was Hannah. Now, it's Rico. Could this have something to do with what you saw at the wake? [sighs] I thought I was wrong about what I saw. But you're right. The spirit is after us. What? You mean, Ashley and I are next? -What's going on, Cedric-- -No! No, no, no! I don't want to die yet. There is a way. I read on the internet that when a ghost is following you, you should burn the clothes you wore at the wake, and then douse the corpse with holy water. That stops it. You and Ashley should do that. -All right. -I'll go back to the wake. -[man] Hey, bro, easy. -Sure, sure. There you go. -You better go. The cops are here. -You guys be careful. Yes, sure. [indistinct chatter] Go on and eat, my love. I know this is your favorite. Hey, Eva, you're here. Come on. Come on. Join us. Lucy, I didn't know it would come to this. Come on, Eva. Let's eat. Don't you miss Roman? Lucy, enough. Wake up! What's with you? Roman is gone. Emmanuel is gone. They're not coming back. Accept that! No, Eva. Everything is going according to plan. I can't take this anymore. I will make right all the wrongs you did. [eerie music playing] [panting] Uncle, didn't you say their son's life was worth nine lives? So, now you believe me? Now that you've seen Macmac's mysterious drawings. -Are you drunk? -Come on, Uncle. Those who went to the wake of Lucy's child, did they break any superstitious rules? How would I know? I didn't go to the wake. I just heard about it. Marcelo... Did you break any, Uncle? No way! That's what I was trying to tell you. You shouldn't have come straight home. Macmac, you didn't break any rules, right? Leni, wait. Where are you going? I'll go see Ms. Eva at the wake. She knows a lot about superstitions. She might be able to help us. -[man] Cross that street. -Here's my fare. -There are tricycles on the other side. -Okay, thanks. [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] -What's with you? -I'm sorry, miss. Sorry. [screams] [squeals] [Leni screaming] Help! -[screams] -[thud] Leni! Leni. TOWN OF ALFONSO What am I doing here? What did you do to me? What? -I didn't do anything to you. -Stop the car. Let me out! -I said let me out! -Ouch! All right, wait a second! What is it about you girls and getting out of cars? I found you unconscious at the market. I carried you to the car. I was just trying to help you. Why are you so angry? Well, why didn't you say so? Wow. Thanks, okay? Thank you, but I can take care of myself. And I'm sorry, but I'm not used to having someone take care of me. What are you doing here, anyway? [somber music playing] I'm going back to the wake. Why? First, it was Hannah. Then Rico. Now, the cops see me as a suspect. They don't believe me. I'm starting to look like I'm crazy. What did you see? I saw the dead guy kill Hannah. The dead guy from the wake. That's also what I saw when Marcelo died. People say I should pour holy water on the dead... to keep their soul from wandering. We're going to the same place. Ms. Eva? Ms. Eva? [door creaks] Anybody home? Ms. Eva? [suspenseful music playing] Open it. [gasps] Where's the corpse? -[clattering] -[gasps] [footsteps wandering] [eerie music playing] [flashlight clicks] [screams] Macmac. Macmac! Macmac? Macmac! How old is Macmac? Seven years old. Where could he be? [Uncle] Leni! Leni, it's Macmac! What happened? I just went to take a leak. When I returned, he was gone, and the gate was open. Come on, Uncle. Why did you leave him alone? And who is this? Why? Who are you? You talk tough, huh? What's with you? Stop it. I know where Macmac is. [suspenseful music playing] Macmac! [panting] Macmac. Are you all right? Don't scare me like that again, okay? Mmm-hmm. [sobbing] [rain falling] [sad music playing] Mom and Dad found Macmac under that tree. He's never forgotten that place since. Where are his parents? Why doesn't he speak? My parents tried to look for them, but to no avail. We also had him checked, but the doctor didn't find anything wrong. Are you done praying? My prayers fall on deaf ears anyway. That's not true. Why? Does He grant your prayers? No. I prayed that my parents' death was just a dream. Aren't you angry? He won't give us everything we pray for. Thank you. My parents gave this to me. [Uncle] Leni! Leni! Ms. Eva! I'm no demon, all right? Come on, Macmac. -[Uncle] Where did you go? -Leni, I came here to warn you. Your lives are in danger. You and everyone else who broke the superstition. [suspenseful music playing] I saw him kill my friend. [Uncle] I knew it. Those rumors are true. Put your hands up. No! [Eva] When my nephew Emmanuel died, Roman couldn't accept it. [Lucy] Roman! -Where are you? -Roman, stop it! -If you're real, show yourself! -Stop it! [Eva] He lost his faith in God and made a pact with the devil to get his son back. The price was nine lives. The people came after them. [crowd yelling] [Eva] They burned their house down. -[baby crying] -Lucy! [Eva] I came to help, but I was shocked to find my nephew alive. His back was burned. I decided right there and then to take Emmanuel away from them and take him to a safe place. At first, I only wanted to warn you because your lives were in danger. And my nephew's life as well. [sobs] [Eva cries] [sad music playing] [sobs] -[sobs] -Leni. Leni, it's still Macmac. He's still Macmac. Leni, look. [Uncle] If he's really evil, how could he be that cute and chubby? [Eva] Leni... Stop Roman from coming back from the dead. [sobbing] We went back to the wake, but his corpse was gone. -How can we stop this now? -[sobs] They must have gone back to their house that burned down. At the end of the coconut field in San Gertrudes. -They must be there. -[sobbing] Let's go. [eerie music playing] [sobbing] -Macmac, stay here. -[crying] I will come back for you. Don't go anywhere, okay? Okay, that's it. We're safe now. Are you sure? What if it has nothing to do with the wake? What if Cedric really did kill Hannah and Rico? [suspenseful music playing] -[engine revs] -[tires screech] Come on, let's go inside. -[wind rushing] -Wait. He's here! He's here! -[Uncle] Macmac! -[Eva] Macmac!

All right, take care. Quit bugging me, stop it. Stay beside me. -Sis, close the door, quick! -Okay! You're overreacting. -Hey, are you really sure we did it right? -Yes, we burned the clothes. -You'll be fine now, right? -Why? Where are you going? I'll just get some food. I'm starving! -No, don't. Let's just go. -You're too much. It's okay, I'll be back in a second. -Sis, be quick, or you'll get it from me. -Yes, whatever. -Hey, hurry up! -[Justin] I said yes! Gosh. -[pop music playing on earphones] -[humming] -[chuckles] -[shutter clicks] -[footsteps approaching] -[shutter clicks] Sis? [pop music playing on earphones] [sighs] [footsteps approaching] Sis?

[screaming] [glass breaking] -[music continues on earphones] -Hmm... [sobbing] [groans] [screaming] [groans] [screaming] Justin! Justin! [screaming] Justin! [screaming] [panting] [groaning] [screams] [thud] -[music playing on earphones] -[humming] Ashley? [groans] Ashley. [gasps] Ashley! [sobbing] My face.

She was killed, Cedric. -Ashley was killed! -What? -What happened? -I don't know! Ashley's dead. She's gone, Cedric, she was killed! Killed by... [tires screech] [screams] -[crash] -[metal screeching] Justin! [gasps] This is my fault. [grunts] [melancholy music playing] Cedric, it's not your fault. Let's put an end to this. [eerie music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[groans] Oh, my. He was sandwiched. [siren howling] [eerie music playing] Your father is returning soon. Our family will be complete again. Only three more lives. -[eerie music playing] -Macmac! Macmac! Macmac, open the door! Macmac! [eerie music building] -[engine revs] -[screams] [gasps] [pants] -[keys jangle] -[engine sputters] [screams] Why me? I didn't do anything wrong! Here. Here. Here. It's five pesos short of 50. It's all yours! [whimpering] [radio turning on] -[woman] Don't! Don't kill him! -[man] I will kill him! [screaming on radio] [screams] [whimpering] [panting] [voices continue on radio] [woman on radio screams] [grunting] -[glass shatters] -[thuds] [woman on radio] You are evil! [sobbing] [creaking] [sobbing] -[sobbing] -[smoke hissing] -[sobbing] -[voices whispering indistinctly] Macmac. Don't be scared. Your Aunt Eva just wants to tell you something. Leni's life is in danger. Help them. [wind rushing] [sobbing] [bicycle wheel turning] Huh? [eerie music playing] [tire popping] Wait, I think we have a flat tire. -What? -I'll go check. [exhales] Yes, we've got a flat. [door opens] I'll go ahead to the house. I'll meet you there when you're done. -What? -[door closes] What? This won't take long. Wait for me. [Leni] You can just follow. Hey. You're scared, aren't you? No. Let's go. [eerie music playing] [Cedric] Is this the place? So, where's the corpse? I'll take a look over there. -Ouch! -Cedric! [dramatic music playing] Are you okay? Come on. What should we do now? Give me the flashlight. [indistinct rustling] Let's go. Are you all right? Of course. Don't be afraid. I'll take care of you. [romantic music playing] [bracelet jingling] It will protect you as you protect me. I don't believe in that. I do. And I also believe in you. [eerie music playing] Stay here. Stay behind me. -[air rushing] -[screaming] Leni! [screaming] [Leni] Cedric! [screaming] [Leni] Let me go! Cedric! [Leni screaming] [eerie music building] [tense music playing] [Leni screaming in distance] Leni. -[screaming] -Leni! [hissing and growling] [hissing] -[thud] -[yelps] [fire blazing] [voices chanting indistinctly] [dramatic music playing] -No! -[Leni shrieks] Don't hurt my husband! We know everything! You don't know what Roman and I have gone through! But what you're doing is wrong! You have no right to talk to me that way! Did you hear me? -You know nothing! -Let me go. [Leni] Cedric! [screams] Cedric! [dramatic music continues] -Don't! I said don't touch my husband! -[Macmac crying] Cedric! -[Lucy] You're a bad boy! -Cedric, wake up! -Come here! I will kill you! -[crying] You're a very bad boy! Come here! Macmac! [Lucy] I will kill you all! Where are they? -Macmac! -[Lucy] Where are they? I will kill you all! Just look! -I'm going to kill this boy. -Don't! [Lucy] You don't want me to? -Then give me your lives! -[Cedric] Don't! [Leni crying] Please don't. [crying] Take me instead. Cedric! -What? -[crying] Don't hurt him! What now? Will you give up your lives or not? Don't hurt your son! He is Emmanuel. [sobbing] While your house was burning down, Ms. Eva saved him and took him to the church to keep him away from you. [screams] That's a lie! I'm telling the truth! Look at his back. Ms. Eva said when she was trying to escape with Emmanuel, he burned his back. [screams] My son! [screams] [gasps] [eerie music playing] -[melancholy music playing] -[Roman] Lucy... Lucy. Roman. Our child... is gone. [sobbing] The boy, he's our son. He didn't die in the fire. He is Emmanuel. [gasps] Lucy? Lucy! [melancholy music intensifies] Lucy. [yelling] Ms. Lucy was pregnant. Two lives were taken from her. [eerie music playing] [ominous music playing] [Leni] Hurry, get up there. Let's go in here. Leni, stay here. I'll take care of him. I'm scared, Cedric. [suspenseful music playing] We can do this, Leni. We can do this. -[gasps] -[footsteps approaching] [tense music playing] [thud] [thud] -[thuds] -[grunting] [grunts] [both grunting] [growls] -[grunts] -[groans] [dramatic music playing] [both grunt] [screaming] [bangs wood] [screaming] [grunts] Macmac, run! [screaming] Cedric! Stay out of this! -He's gone! You are the only one left! -That's a lie! [groans] Macmac, run! [panting] [ominous music playing] If you die, I'll get my family back! Mine and Emmanuel's! Let me go! [thud] Macmac! [grunts] Hurry, Macmac! [Leni] Cedric! Cedric! Cedric, wake up! Cedric! -[grunts] -[Macmac sobs] I lost everything because of you! [whimpering] [sobs] [groans] Macmac. Macmac! Emmanuel, son! [sad music] [ominous music] See what happened because of you? -[groans] -[grunts] [thuds] [ominous music builds] Leni! -Don't! -Leni! [panting] [eerie music] [panting] Cedric, that's enough. [Leni] He's dead. Let's get out of here. Let's go! [eerie music] [flames crackling] [eerie music fades] [sad music] [music fades] [indistinct chatter] [romantic music] [cellphone chimes] [KakaoTalk message alert] [chuckles] I will miss Uncle. Leni... Cedric... Macmac. Macmac! [both chuckle] [laughs] [emotional music] Cedric. -Hey. -[chuckles] [romantic music] [door closes] [chuckling] [door opens] [sudden horror music] [gasps] [suspenseful music] [gasping] [sudden horror music] [Leni gasps] [ominous music] [ominous music builds] [eerie music] [ominous music] [music builds up] [music fades] [suspenseful piano music] [eerie music] [music fades]
