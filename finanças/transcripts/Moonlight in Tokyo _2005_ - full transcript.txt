Eat. This can't go on. I'm going crazy. You only look after him once a week. I let him out of sight for 10 minutes, and he threw out all my shoes. Yes. Before mom died she told us to take care of him. I'm getting a divorce. He's our brother. Not one like this. Send him to a home. I like this story. Mother Duck laid 8 eggs. She watched her babies hatch one by one, all white and chubby and adorable. Mother Duck was very happy. But the last one was grayish black. An ugly duckling with short legs and a pointed beak. His siblings refused to play with him. They won't even live with him. So the ugly duckling had to leave. What do you think? They're pretty enough. Aren't you happy? For this lot, I borrowed millions from the loan sharks. I'm paying a lot of interest everyday. They start tomorrow. We only have tonight. You're so brilliant. Did you pick one? Yes. White skirt with black panties. White skirt with black panties. What should we do? Go find them. What's the matter? What's this? You from Hong Kong? I'm a triad member. Aren't you afraid? Let go. No, we were classmates in primary school. You sat next to me. I'm Jun. You know each other. I came to Japan with my brother but we got separated. We agreed that if we did we'd wait by that post. Where's your friend? Don't mind him. Why don't you wait for your brother over there? I've been waiting for 5 hours. Let him wait. What? 5 hours? I'm very patient. What is 1 plus 1? Who's the Japanese Prime Minister? Junichiro Koizumi. What would you do if you lost your passport? Pick it up. You're crazy? I'm not. It's a long story. I'm slightly retarded. That's different from crazy. You are slightly retarded. Now let go. They're all staring at us. There's your brother. My brother is a man. Who was that? He's retarded. God knows. What a waste of time. This isn't enough for interest. Thank goodness for your friend. You bastard. What's wrong with you? You picked on a retarded person. I'm retarded but I'm not stupid. You bastard. If I don't rob him again I can't show my face in Shinjuku. Shing, run. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 No. 6 installments. You have a week to pay back 1 million yen. If not, you either work for me or you jump from here. Take your pick. You won't get away with it. Make the best of it. Bye. Who's taking a leak? I'm Jun. Are you drunk? Do I look drunk? I'm only in debt. Help me up. Come. Bastard. Your fly is open. What are you doing? I told you to give me a hand. Forget the damn fly. Over there, it's clean. Stand properly. Go away. I didn't ask for your help. Get lost. Bastard. You're always cursing. Look at you now. Poor boy. Good boy. Don't cry. Good boy. I want to go home. Good boy, stick out your tongue. OK. Contract. Alright. Now stretch your legs. Open wide. Don't. Don't be afraid. Help. Want me to break your knees? No. Come on. I don't have all day. What are you doing here? You told me to get Dr. Hui. You gave me his phone number. You have taken a beating. Your medication is on the table. You're here to attend to me. What are you doing with that moron? He's only retarded. I told you I'm not stupid. Anyone whose IQ is below 70 is retarded. They don't comprehend the abstract can't concentrate. They are slow learners and have difficulty expressing themselves. Sensitive to criticism, low EQ. They have behavioral problems. Such as screaming throwing things and incontinence. That's none of my business. Unable to attend to their personal hygiene. They're prone to skin diseases that may be contagious. This cream is for you. If you live together, you have to be careful. So? So it's you. 7,500 yen on taxi. 5,000 yen for the doctor. 1,900 yen on food. That comes to... 14,400 yen. So? It's a long story. Here I go. Yesterday you asked me to take you home. I told you I had to wait for my brother, right? You said you must go home, right? Then I asked you if I can stay with you. You said yes, right? I still have to wait for my brother, right? And I need a place to stay, right? So? You still owe me money, right? I need you to pay me back, right? I need a place to stay, right? But it's hard to find a place in Japan, right? Damn you. I warned you about the loan sharks. Sit here. Where are you going? You still owe me money. I'm trying to sort things out. Will you shut up? You owe me money. Sit. Of course I have 5 million yen. It is the company's money. Kano and I work for the same boss. He's my enemy. You want me to lend you money? You want me dead? I still have a daughter to think about. Yan, you're in charge of all these clubs, and we're both Chinese. There are billions of them. I can't help them all. If I can, I'll be the Premier. Be a gigolo. I told you that on your first day. With my looks? Don't pull my leg. It doesn't matter. The customers don't care. They want hugs and kisses and a good screw. Most importantly you must understand them. And... And if you sell your ass... I have principles. Who do you think you are? Listen. You'll get used to it. And it'll be alright. You won't mind when you see the money. Money, money. You'll feel good with money. You'd still have to do it if you don't pay off Kano. You have no choice. Your friend is really something, she's happy. What are you doing? I didn't say anything. Hi handsome. Why didn't you tell me you have good stuff? Good morning. How are you? She stopped crying when you hugged her? Why? It's a long story. Make it short. She's happier after she hugged me. Elaborate. Let me tell you. Mom said I used to make people happy. They were happy when they hugged me. But when they found out I was retarded, they stopped. Who would want to? Right? They never hugged me. How would they know I can make them happy? Right? Hoi, you're different. You hugged me, you should know. Right? Really? You can see for yourself. No, maybe later. Fine. What are you looking at? I'll show you something. Tits. Isn't that nice? I'm not allowed to read this. Is it nice? Answer me. These girls are nice. Do you understand? Yes, it's bad. Have you been bad? No. If you don't count the times I'm by myself. How bad? Very. What is it? Big duckie. There are 2 kinds of gigolo and whores. The kind who drinks only. And the kind who drinks and screws. Some customers would prefer... the second kind. How can he manage? He doesn't know Japanese. Just teach him a few lines. Say he's Korean. They're in. 60,000 yen a pop. What about technique? You're born with it. Just give it a try. Try? How? Let me... What are you doing? Protecting the Earth. Jun. How much do I owe you? 30,500 yen. Do you have it? I'm running out of money. Let's not talk about that now. Jun. Are we brothers? Yes. Good. Your brother is running out of money. Right? If I have no money, how can I pay you? Right? If I don't pay you, then you have no money. Right? If you have no money, you can't lend me money. Right? Then I'm shit for luck. I don't understand. The important thing is to make money. The lady thought of a way. I want to discuss with you and see if it'll work. Many Japanese mamas and nanas lead very boring lives. When they're bored, they want to be bad. If you help them, they'll pay you. That makes me a whore. Wrong. Man can never be a whore. What am I then? Will you... keep the ladies company? Make them bad, make them happy? Then they'll pay me. Smart kid. Do you want to do it? You're the big brother. I must listen to you. Right? Not really. Eat. Good morning, sir. I don't speak Japanese. I don't understand. I can't read Japanese. I don't understand. I don't speak it. I don't speak it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm Korean. I'm Korea. Korean. I'm not Korean. I don't understand. Get out. You read it wrong. Sorry. Sorry. I'm Korean. I'm Korean. I don't speak. I don't speak. Yamaha. Yamaha. Yamaha. Yamaha. I understand. I understand. You're playing teacher? I'm Korea. Korean. Korean. Don't fuck with me. Try harder. I'm Korean. Kiddo, I found a customer for Jun. What must you do afterwards? Bathe. Collect the money. What do I do first? Up to you, but you must get the money. 40,000 yen. Go with her and make her happy. If you do that, she'll pay you. It's rude to turn down the money, understand? I won't be rude. Don't forget the money. Don't scratch your ass. I need to poo poo. Damn. You promised to get me a good one. You got me a man? What's wrong with you? You wanted Chinese. I got you a Chinese. They want Jun. He wants to come from behind. Jun is retarded. They won't rape him if he won't do it. We'll just refund. Let's get started. Hey. What did you do in there? Everything you taught me. Were you in the back? He was. He was happy too. He gave me 70,000 yen. Such filthy money. Then give it to me. No, I'll keep this for you. You're still young. But you still owe me. I know. Here's 500 yen. That's it? I pay you a bit everyday. Then you'll have money to spend everyday. If I pay up now. You'll just spend it all. You think of everything. Of course. What are you reading? I finished Grade 9. Moving onto Grade 10 this year. You're still in high school? It's a long story. May I begin? I'm slow. Mom said I'll get smart from studying. My school is different from yours, right? I study on my own. I spent 3 years in Grade 7. 5 in Grade 8. 6 in Grade 9. I'll be in Grade 10 this year. How did you figure that? I mark my own test papers. I don't slack off and I don't cheat. I'm good at language and Putonghua. I'll be in Grade 10 and I'll pick science classes. So there'll be more choices in college. But you're only in Grade 9. When will you get to college? When I'm 57. Isn't that too old? I'm stupid. Then don't go to college. Then I'll be even more stupid. What grade were you in? Grade 11. Then you must know quadratic equation. Can you teach me? That's my specialty, I'll help you. 10,000 yen per hour, alright? You bastard. You know this? Get to work. This early? At noon, the men are at work. The ladies are home doing nothing. Best time for us to make money. I've waited a month for today... Hurry. We've been at it for so long. I haven't done the chores or go to the market. My husband will be mad. What are you doing? Nothing important. What do you mean? Mom said I used to make people happy. They were happy when they hugged me. But when they found out I was retarded, they stopped. We're done. Let's go home and watch TV. No. You have to work. Again? It's past 7. Those lonely office ladies are getting off work. Another good time for us. Let's go. I'm going home to sleep. No. Work again? It's only midnight. The ladies are getting off their night shifts. Good time to make money. I have a test tomorrow. So? I want a day off. No, I still owe 500,000 yen. It's due the day after tomorrow. Hang on for another day. Then it'll take me longer to move up. You're going to college at 57. Another day won't kill you. I can't do it. You can if I say you can. Are you Korean? Excuse me, I'm Korean. I don't understand Japanese. I only screw. You're not Korean. What about you? Tell me where you're from? Hong Kong... Sorry. I said it. You're from Hong Kong? No. Why are you in Japan? I like you. What? I like you. Can you say that again for me in Japanese? Excuse me, I'm Korean. I don't understand Japanese. I only screw. We're late. Let's go. Time's up. Pens down. Go change. I have to wait for the examiner. Leave it. The examiner will mark your paper. I'm the examiner. What? I'm the examiner. I'll smack you. I'm supposed to be on leave. Go. You promised me a day off. Go. It's miserable not having a day off. You always lie. Go. What? Didn't you want your day off? Now you get what you want. What? You get your summer holidays when you pass. What do you want to do? My treat. Just name it. You don't want to play? Let's go then. Merry-go-round. What? Merry-go-round. Merry-go-round? That's stupid. Pick something else. Why are you staring at her? Did I? There. You're staring again. You won't understand. Look. This is called culture. I don't understand. He can pay her directly. Why did he do that? Let me try. Damn. You finger me? What did you tell her? She's Chinese. So? You knew. Of course. Only Chinese would take this job in Japan. I understand. What? You're retarded, you can tell her yourself. Sorry, Kano-san. I'll pay the 500,000 yen in a few days. Please make an exception, I'll pay the interest. Hoi. I heard you're in a different line of work and doing very well. I'm just working for Yan. Cut the crap. From now on, every 100,000 yen you make, I get half. I'll look after you, understand? You don't work for Yan anymore. Yes. What are you looking at? What? She's bad. Who? Kano's wife? It's her. Why do I work during summer holiday? I owe money. Why? I want to make more money. Why? The things I want to do cost money. So I need to make more money. What's the point? Making all these money? I want good food, expensive watches... buy a house, a car. You already have those. I need money to buy what I really like. I like my mom. Can I buy her with money? We never have enough time. Yet it feels like a long time. That's good. Do you like me? Yes. Really? Really. I like your honesty. I'll see you again next week. This money? It's from me. What is it for? I like you. Who do you think you are? I pay to be happy. We're happy. I pay for my happiness. It has nothing to do with you. You got your money, now get lost. Go to sleep. What is it? Hoi, Jun threw out the neighbor's things. He wouldn't. I told you he can't control his emotions. Look. I'm holding you responsible. I won't hit you. Am I that annoying? They're all like this. I understand women. Since I was a kid, when I'm upset... I'd throw out everything. Socks, shoes, clothes... even the washing machine. My family hates me. But I can't help it. Who'd expect I would get in trouble. I came to Japan with my family. My sister-in-law took me shopping, but I wanted to go to the amusement park. My brother slapped me. I was upset. His baby was crying. I picked her up. He thought I was going to throw her out. I'm not crazy. He yelled at me without asking. They didn't believe me. I believe you. You said hugging you makes me happy I don't think so. You're not unhappy. So it won't make any difference. We start all over today. Start a new life. You sound like you just got out of jail. You told me to work hard. We need to make a lot of money. But I need a break. Can I take a few days off? No. One day? In your dreams. Fine. Take your damn day off. Asshole. Don't hit me. Asshole. Don't hit me. What do you want to do? My treat. Treat my ass. Just tell me if you want to come here. Your wife gave me the phone number. Your son takes after you. You still have that job? Don't make that kind of money. Don't do it. Who's looking after the kid? What would he think of you? Do I do something wrong again? I didn't know it would come to this. Do you know since the day she left me... she's been waiting to see me fuck up in Japan? You told her what I did? I'm so ashamed. Did we do something shameful? Just me, not you. Happy now? Why did you go see her after work? I can tell you miss her. Can you tell she hates me? She told me... she'll wait for you. Your son too. You know I'm retarded, right? I figure... if they want you back and you ignore them, then they didn't give up on you. You gave up on yourself. Right? Just a thought. I'll tell them you don't want to see them. Asshole. What are you laughing at? I didn't. Don't force yourself if you don't want to see them. Bastard. Shing, you bastard. You double cross me. How dare you lie to me. Stop. You'll kill him. It's not my fault. It's Kano who got the girls. I did it for the money. Action. What are you reading? Don't I have reading materials for you? Never mind. Just do your thing. What are you doing? Nothing. Look, bitch. As if you don't screw around. You never pay me any attention. Shut up. What's up? I'll kill you. If a car stops in front of Kabukicho, what does it mean if someone opens the door for you? Convenience. Power and prestige. We're rich and powerful now. We should hire more people and expand the business. If everything works out I'll help you find your brother. Jun. Jun. What's the matter with you? I don't want to go home. Who said anything about going home? Why did you run? I saw my brother. I lied to you. He didn't dump me. I left him. I don't want to embarrass the family. I don't want my brother to fight with his wife and make the kid cry. Crying is not good for kids. I used to cry when I was a kid. My mom gave me drugs. And they screwed up my brains. Do you understand? Jun, have I lied to you? Well, not this time. Your folks are anxiously looking for you. They look worried. So they must want you back. If you don't want to see them then they didn't give up on you. You gave up on yourself. Thanks. Do we have to do this every time? Thanks. Shall I take you to your brother? We have bookings today and tomorrow. Really? You remember? I'm beginning to like this job. You're such a joker. Let's go. He likes it from behind. You okay with that? He only watches from behind. Let's begin. She's my wife. Don't worry, I'll just watch. You don't want my business? Sorry. I had muscle cramps. Sorry. Hello. Damn. Kano was here. He has a gun. Take Jun with you and hide. No. Jun. Jun, open up. What happened? Tell me. What happened? What's the matter? He killed my wife. He killed my wife. Go. He killed my wife. He killed my wife. Don't be scared. Go. Don't worry. This place is closed. I used to come here with my wife when we first arrived in Japan. I'll leave it here. I didn't do it. Do you believe it? Do you believe me? I just came out of the shower. They were fighting. Come on. We'll go to the police. No. You didn't do it. He's framing you. We'll tell the police and then beat him up. No. I won't go. No. Damn. Stop throwing things. No. Stop it. Okay, we're not going. Stop it. It's always like this. Everyone is blaming me, doing me wrong. Bastard. How dare you hit me. Don't ever come to me for help. I'll kill you. Asshole. 30 minutes in the dark should scare you. Jun. Jun. What's up? What's with you? No one will hit you. What's with you? I've been looking for you all this time. Have you eaten? No bitching. No police. You did nothing wrong. Why won't you go? I told you I'm not going. You don't have to go. Can I just ask you? I'm just asking. Ask away. Then answer me. When we were kids in Grade 1, we sat next to each other. Next to us there was a window. During recess, we played bombing... by throwing paper airplanes out the window. But you knocked down a flower pot, and hit a woman on the head. She went to the police, and the teacher brought me to the station. The police told my mom to take me to a doctor. The doctor said I'm retarded. And sent me to a special school. If it wasn't for the police, I wouldn't be retarded. You said I knocked over the pot? Why did they arrest you? You were my big brother then. I must take care of you. Right? We learnt ballet together at school. "Swan Lake". Hold on. "Swan Lake" is different from the "Ugly Duckling" In what way? "Swan Lake" is about a man becoming a swan. "Ugly Duckling" is about a swan thinking it's a duck. Hoi. What happened? The police is looking for you. You're always like this. Sorry. Yan will call you later. She'll tell you what to do. You go with her. Behave yourself, alright? Where are you going? You took care of me when I was little. Now it's my turn. I meant what I said. Sorry. You said you're the murderer? Yes, arrest me. Lock me up for a few days. Mr. Wong Hoi. You're under arrest. Wait. I'm the murderer. But that's not what happened. Mr. Nishigawa. Yes. I want to speak in Chinese. Every few days I'll go to Mr. Li's house to screw his wife. I was at his house when it happened. He came home. He hit me on the head. I was angry and pushed his wife out. Just like that. Every time I see his wife I'd videotape the process. Want to see? Mr. Li, please excuse us. Good idea. This is so humiliating anyway. Stop. I admit I killed my wife. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. He actually fell for it. You're brilliant. You got a confession out of him. I've been around and it's not in vain. Bastard. He's a professor with a conscience. Unlike you. Look at you. I risked my life to crack your case. Jun's family is looking for him. Wait here. Damn. I sent him back to Hong Kong. Yan. He won't leave. He's still here? He hit me with an umbrella. Come inside. Come quick. Or I'll throw away your candy. Go ahead. Hoi will buy me more. Leave him alone. He gave me tetanus. Hoi. Hoi. Get down, asshole. Why didn't you leave? I miss you. Get down. Stop fooling around. Have you had enough? Your brother is here. Damn. He'll really let me have it. He wouldn't dare. I'll punch his lights out. Promise? I promised to look after you. We'll look out for each other. You were my big brother then. I must take care of you. We went back to Hong Kong a year later. I visited all the primary schools I attended. I hope to find out where I've met Jun. None of them had his record. Did I forget any school? Or was he mistaken from the start? I begin to doubt my memory. But I remember the night... I was drunk at the Shinjuku station. Someone called Jun offered to take me home. I'm home now.
