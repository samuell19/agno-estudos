I work as a librarian. I've been working here for 8 years, 7 months, 26 days, 13 hours, 26 minutes, 19 seconds, 20, 21, 22... I help with borrowing, returning, and organizing books in the library. Entering bar codes and numbering take more work. You must be careful. I think I'm suited for this. I love my job. Good afternoon. Hello. As you probably guessed, I have a crush on her. It's my first time. I've never seen her with long nails. Her hair is never out of place. She always lines things up in order. In this filthy, unsanitary... Want some? germ-filled, dirty world, she's like a sterile, clean zone. And the only one who would understand me. I kept notes on my 100 days with her. What I bought and what we said. She wore the white shirt from last Thursday. Paid 70 cents. Talked for 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Why keep track? I told you. I like her. But why all this... What do you mean? I think it's a necessary step. If you like someone, you observe them. So of course you record everything. And when you're sure she's the one... You'd confess. Normally. Right. Of course. Did you confess your feelings? I set the alarm for it. (The Plan Man) I woke up refreshed and on time as always. (6:00 WAKE UP) (06:05 MAKE THE BED) I changed the sheets. And I started the day nice and clean. (STERILIZE) (06:45 SHOWER) I washed thoroughly. (7:30 CLEAN UP THE BATHROOM) Cleaning up afterwards is good etiquette. Today's Wednesday. I wear sky blue on Wednesdays. I took my notes, which I can't go anywhere without. And right on time... (08:30 GO TO WORK) I headed out the door. Things run smoothly when you move to plans. It helps you maintain a diligent and healthy lifestyle. (8:42 CROSS THE STREET) My long-awaited lunch break. (12:15 CONFESS TO HER!) Well, I think it's time. I've watched you for 100 days, Ji-won, and recorded... What? What the... Are you okay? Mister! Wait! You forgot this! This wasn't in my plan. This wasn't in my plan. This wasn't in my plan. It wasn't in my plan. Hey, kid! Wait! Grandma! It's not mine. What is it? Are you okay? Did he hurt you? I can explain. There was a lady here this afternoon. But she's not the one who's normally here. - Where did it go? - Why are you doing this? You mean my aunt? Huh? Welcome. I'm looking for someone. Before the expiry date Before I'm too late I'll microwave you For 30 seconds Don't worry, triangle gimbap Thirty seconds is all you need Don't cry, triangle gimbap Now, come into my mouth Thank you. Kind of a gloomy song for a fine day, huh? Now, I'll sing my hot, new song. It's called "Plan Man." Your day begins with an alarm Alarms are always on time Get up to the wake-up alarm Wash to the shower alarm Leave to the work alarm When the alarm rings at 12:15 p.m. You go inside a convenience store At the store, she is always there You want to tell her how you feel So you set an alarm and plan To make the perfect confession So you set an alarm and plan For the only girl who is exactly like you Like me Like him Like her You're lonely It's "Plan Man"! He's the Plan Man! Plan Man! Plan Man! Plan Man! Plan Man! That's personal! Wait! Mister! Hold on! Mister! Wait! I'm sorry. I was going to take a peep, but it was so fun, so I ended up reading it all. Mister! I'm sorry. Mister. Mister? Want my help? I'm really close with Ji-won. For real! Forget it, then! But she mentioned you a few times. A guy who comes every day at the same time. What did she say again? Wait! Come back! Wait! Come back! Hey! What a strange woman. Making a song out of my story! Anyway, that's how I met Ji-won. Finally! Your name is Han Jung-seok? Yes, I'm Han Jung-seok. You always come at the same time and line things up perfectly straight. Well, yes. But... I hate that. - Pardon? - I started therapy. Why don't you try it, too? Therapy? I'm comfortable and happy the way I am now. Are you really happy? With no one to eat with, lining things up all the time and setting alarms for everything? You're really happy? Do you know why they're like this? Because I wash them too much. I wash them hundreds of times a day. I can't even shake hands with people I'm glad to see. I'm not happy. I can't stand living like this. I hate it! I'll live recklessly. I won't wash my hands. And this! I won't clean it up! Ji-won... Your purse. Though I can't now. But I'll change. I can't stand the way that I am now. I'm sorry. But I hate you because you're like that, too! Ji-won! Mr. Han? Mr. Han Jung-seok? Yes? Beef tripe and soju are perfect for a day like this. Mister? Do you want to do this? Band auditions? How can she ask me to do that? Well... Why do you think she did that? How would I know? You get musically sensitive and creative at times like this. From my experience... Just kidding. The truth is, it's a band audition, so I can't go alone. Why me? The lyrics for my new song came from your notes. Copyright issues can get messy. So we can sing it together. We just met. Why together? Maybe it's because I read your notes. I feel like I know you like an old friend. Are you out of your mind? I'm not crazy. She kept calling me "Mister." Then a friend, all of a sudden? How am I her friend? I see. Let me get this straight. You came here because you confessed to a woman and she told you to get therapy? Then another woman asked you to be in a band together? She's not just a woman. I watched her for 100 days. Right! So let's show her that you've changed. She said she hates what you do, not the person you are. Right? Yes, but... Let's write down what you do differently from others. Here. Let's start writing. It's ripped. Why did you do that? It's ripped. I'll just write it down here. It's okay. This will do. First. Set alarms for everything. Second, third, fourth... You write the rest at home. We're not alone. Don't keep it to yourself. Ask your friends and family. And bring it to our next session. But why... I have to come again? Are you really happy? With no one to eat with, lining things up all the time and setting alarms for everything? You're really happy? (22:00 SLEEP) Eun-ha? Yes? I was wondering... What do you think of me? Look. I have a boyfriend. What? So weird. You're a little weird. See a shrink. No. Who says you're weird? Really? I'm not weird? - Huh? - Let's have spaghetti. - I'm not... - I got a call. Hon? Did you have lunch? I'm dying here. How about spicy soup? Sounds perfect! - Not me. - How about Chinese? Hello. He really does come on time. In your opinion... Do you think I'm weird? You're totally weird. Who sets an alarm to come into a store? And why line up the triangle gimbaps? What are you wearing? Unbutton your shirt. It's hot out. I unbuttoned one. How have you been? - Are you new here? - Yes. Writing better these days? Get your eyes off me. Mr. Han Jung-seok is joining us today. Let's all greet him, shall we? We appreciate your courage. I tried to write something like the doctor said. But I still can't. All day long, I wrote A, B, C, D, E, F, G... Just pages and pages of the alphabet. But the fact that I actually wrote something makes me feel like maybe I can start writing again. I know some of you still don't believe me. But it's true. I saw someone die from getting hit by pigeon poop. Mister! I'm serious! Don't laugh! So annoying. I saw pigeons outside my house again today. One of them looked me right in the eye. I got really scared. That's why I wore my raincoat. I had a car accident. It wasn't my fault. That jerk cut in front of me. Then what? I got mad and floored it. Then I rammed his car. Yes, I shouldn't have gotten so mad. But the jerk stared right at me. I still can't stand it! I want to kill whoever looks at me! Other than that... This morning was good. I didn't get mad when Mom woke me up. I'll try harder not to get mad. Thank you. Great. We appreciate your courage. Let's hear from our new member, Han Jung-seok. Okay. I... I wrote it down. Mine's pretty simple compared to everyone here. First, I set alarms for everything. And I can't stand things that are out of line. And I can't touch dirty things. I never do things that aren't planned. That's all. I think it's weird to meet people without plans. You're just like me. I can't meet people either. I can't be bothered to make plans. I can't be bothered to go outside. I can't be bothered to cross the street. For me, it's not that. I just have to plan. Stop! You always cry! Don't make her cry! It was him, not me! - That's not it. - Like hell! Back off! She's crying because of you again! You pigeon poop! Pigeon poop? Why you little! What? - You want to take me on? - Doc! Lay off the kid! Then you and me! It's on! Please calm down! Damn it! - Stop crying! - Stop getting mad! Why are you crying again? Everyone! We're not alone. Damn it! Stop crying! Stop it! Stop! I said, stop! Stop it! I've had it! I'm going crazy! What am I supposed to do? Wait! Let me think. You! Just do something! Knit or glue eyes on teddy bears! Just do anything! You! People can't get killed by pigeon poop! I got hit by it. I didn't die! And why write the alphabet? Write anything. Like song lyrics. Or stuff on a menu. Just copy things! I don't know why, but I get mad when I see you! What's with me? You! You! You're weird! So don't make plans and just do anything! Meet anyone and go anywhere. That woman and the band! Make a band! Happy, everyone? Problems solved! All solved! So stop whining. I'm going crazy because of you! Me! I can't take it anymore! Doctor! I can't take it! Doc. We'll try harder to change. I'm sorry, everyone. I've been really depressed and lonely these days. I'm so lonely. - I'm sorry. - What? I'm so sorry. Mister! Take it off! Hurry! Hurry! I should just throw it out! Why? Don't trust me? Of course I do. Who else would I trust? There's no stain. It's way worse than stains. Some dirty person hugged me! How terrible. That feels good. Today was horrible. Isn't every day like that for you? What? Hello. Ji-won, I started getting therapy, too. I'm trying to change like you. I don't set alarms. I don't line things up. And I'll just plan anything and... Start a band! A band? What? I don't think I'm ready for a band. Starting a band means real change. Ji-won. He's not serious. Yes! I'll start a band. I'll try that, too. - Really? - Why not? Sure. - Instead... - Eat up! Help me change everything written here. (WARNING DON'T FEED STRAY CATS!) (SET ALARMS FOR EVERYTHING!) (CAN'T STAND THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF LINE) Okay, deal! - Deal! - But the cat... You can't skip practice. Right. - I'll take this. - Wait! - You touched the cat! Germs! - I'll hold on to this. The first one is solved. You can't set alarms. You're going way too fast. Don't cheat and set alarms with your cell. 052572020485864278865936653382... 493324 584849... 863432 695468... It's okay. The hell? Damn it. Sir! Hurry! Do I have to stoop to this? I'm Koo Sang-yoon! But you have to promote your book. You already spent your royalties. Stop bringing that up, fool! But we've got truckloads to sell, sir! Let's talk about this month's new and donated books. Where's Han Jung-seok? What if something happened? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I slept in. I'm so sorry. Slept in? I'm sorry, sir. - Bravo! - Congratulations! I could cry! For the first time in 9 years, Han is late! If you were any later, I would've called the cops. You really slept in? Well... Are you sick? - Han! - Yes? - New and donated books? - Yes, well... We bought 38 new books and coded them. I'm all done, sir. We got 78 donated books. I'll finish classifying them today. Okay, good. About the guest lecture later... Han? What's wrong? Nothing, sir. Good. Not many signed up, so we were asked to fill up the seats. What now? Do it! What is it this time? Thank you! Your tie. If you'll excuse me. Happy now? Yes... 12:15! - I didn't plan this. - It's okay. It's your first day. And don't touch these! I set it all up to help you. Could you return my watch, please? I was late for work without my alarm! And things that are out of line keep bothering me! Going all crazy with anxiety... Stop joking. I'm serious here. I'm so serious! Darn it! Kidding. Just joking. Hang in there, Mister. It's hard for people to change. If changing was easy, we wouldn't be humans. Okay? Try this instead. We're a band now. You've got to do something. Like this. You promised in front of Ji-won. Want me to call her? Not bad. Can you play any instruments? Not really. The piano, maybe... Really? It's your lunch break, right? Aunt So-jung! What about the store? Come in. What the... Why did you bring him over? He's in my band. Hurry up. It gets messy with kids. Right. Excuse me. Try playing. I haven't played in so long. Just play anything you remember. It's so dirty. But I haven't played since I was a kid. It's okay. (AUNT SO-JUNG'S ROOM) That's it. What happened? What? Mister... Where have you been all my life? I've been waiting for you! I could kiss you! What the... You keep getting hugged? You okay? Yes... You sure? I'm fine. Isn't it way past your lunch hour? No! No! No! My jacket! Back then, my show's ratings were over 40%! That means half the country watched my show! What's with you today? Is Chief angry with me? He's napping over there. I swear it's no joke. The writers brought hundreds of people. But I'm the one who picked out what worked. Koo Sang-yoon's eyes are magical! Sir! Pictures! Right. My stomach hurts. I'll be back. He used to cut everything with his hands. And hammer with his fist. This person... He was like a magnet you can put metal on. And this boy... He was a young kid. But his IQ was over 200. Then did he always get perfect scores without studying? Of course! He's a genius! What did he become? A famous scientist? Well, I'm not sure. Turn it once this way and twice the other way. You twist and loop like this. But I can't do it. It's not like I have anyone to give it to. I tried hard for a week, and this is it. Stop crying! Jeez! Just give it to me, then! Hey! I'm sorry. It's okay. Good idea. Right? We appreciate your courage. Next. Han Jung-seok. Mr. Han? Yes. Things have been hectic. I was even late to work. I haven't lived by alarms for... 92 hours... and almost 27 minutes. See, everyone? 28 minutes. We need the will to take action to change like Mr. Han. Doc? Are you okay? Me? Well, I've gotten a lot better. I'm very sorry about what happened last time. It's okay. Seeing you break down like that, I realized that you're just like us. We're not the only ones who need help. Doctor. We appreciate... - your courage. - We appreciate your courage. Well, yes. We can all overcome our problems. Believe that you can change! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Answer it. Really? Excuse me. - Hello? - Mister! Hurry over! The club is hot tonight! I can't! I have something planned. What plan? Today's bi... no... cleaning day. Bi... What? I can't hear! Bidet! It's bidet nozzle cleaning day! That's crazy! Come here, now! Hello? Darn it. Jeez! Fourth. You never do things that aren't planned. Here. But the bidet nozzle... Go on! Do you guys have dogs? Yes! Do you have cats? Yes! Mister! Then let's go crazy like dogs! You and I are too alike You're the same as me So I don't like you! So I hate you! I hate you! Fine, I'll totally change I won't make plans anymore Some lyrics... I won't be on time I'll be late all the time I will change! I'll crush my alarm clock I'll rip my diary I'll live recklessly Give it to the dogs Give it to the cats Give it to the dogs Give it to the cats Give it to the dogs Woof! Woof! Woof!

Give it to the dogs Woof! Woof! Woof! Give it to the cats Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Excuse me. How was my new song? Totally hot, huh? Is it okay to write odd lyrics like that? What do you mean odd? You sang along, too. No, I didn't... My songs are made from special real-life experiences. Like you'd know. Listen to this. It's our audition song. I'll give you the piano piece later. You play the piano? A little bit. I learned it when I was young. How is your therapy going? I go twice a week. Fourth. I never do things that aren't planned. Woof! Woof! Woof! Meow! Meow! Meow! (YOO SO-JUNG) - Hello? - Mister! You didn't walk Ji-won home last night? We parted at the club. You've never dated before, right? Of course I did! I'm a whiz at dating. Anyway, did you listen to the song? Isn't it hot? Hot? No, it's weird. And why is it called "Married Man"? You've got to go strong at auditions. Mister! Let's go for a drink! What? Hello? Looks good. Auntie! I'm back! - Have a seat. - Long time no see. I'm starving! Don't tell me you can't eat tripe. Cow dung used to be in there. That's what makes it good! That's disgusting. If you can't eat it, get out! Cow dung, my butt! Crazy idiot! Forgive him, Auntie. We'll take the house special. And raw liver, okay? - Lots of it! - Okay! Thank you! How can you eat that? Eat a lot, idiots! Mister! I signed us up today. We're a real team now! - I'm starving. - Auntie! - Come in. - Wait up! You came, too? Go inside. Doing good? Not bad. You're entering that? With who? Well, me... Hello. So-jung. Give it up. Aren't you embarrassed? Forget it. It's her life. Let's go somewhere else. We'll come next time. Whatever, idiot! Don't come back! We used to be a band. Let's just say we have different musical styles. I see. Let's have some soju. One shot for you. Here. Here's to our band! Cheers! Bottoms up! You can drink? Alcohol can disinfect the intestines. It's good. - Go sleep at home! - It's getting late. - Jerk! - Everyone else left. It's because of this jerk that I'm going to audition. Isn't he famous? Yes! A totally famous and master songwriter. So he's the married man? Just like in the song. I didn't know he was married. I ended up being a crazy girl who came on to a married man. Like a girl who seduced him to get famous. A crazy woman. Well... That's why! I'll show him I can be a real crazy woman. Watch me! I'll sing the song. Right to his face. Totally cool and calm! I see. Mister, do you... hate me because I'm crazy? No. You're not crazy. Who says that? Here. Wipe your tears. Who says that? Darn it. Mister? Will you leave the band, too? No. It's just the two of us. I'll do it. Really? Yes. For real? You drank too much. Here! That's not clean. You're the best! Gross. She touched it! Faster! Headbanging! Good! What's wrong? You nervous? Let's just practice your intro. Okay. From head to toe, I was born to rock... This doesn't sound like me. It's okay. You've got to go strong. Strong? You've got to sound desperate to win. - Desperate... - You can do it! From head to toe... - Hello, sir! - I'm a huge fan! Good luck, everyone! - Hello! - He's so hot! How long has it been? I meant to call you. Have you been well? Yes. - He's with you? - Yes. We're contestants 297... I was worried, but it looks like you're fine. I'll put in a good word. Good luck! Hello, sir! Contestants 251 to 300, please! (KANG BYEONG-SOO) Are you done wiping? All done. Yes, we're ready. Good. Let's hear it. Should've said you have a wife I loved you without knowing Should've shown you have a wife Why act like a bachelor? Why take off your ring? Why hang up on me? Why not text me back? It's unique. Why have two cell phones? Why list me under a man's name? Why can't you stay over? Married man Married man Married man Married man Married man You should be thankful I gave you my time Married man Get over yourself! Married man I hate your pretentious smiles! Married man I don't need your love! Go love your wife! What lyrics! Is this from experience? Yes, our songs are made from special real-life experiences. Jung Band? You think you can make it with funny lyrics like that? But you're lacking in the basics, such as tone and rhythm. I'm sorry, but I'll disqualify you. Why? I thought it was fun. The song's really well-written. It's fresh. I'll give you a pass. Thank you. The keyboard was great at the interlude. You must've practiced a lot. I just played note after note like this. I look forward to your next performance. I give you a pass. See you in the second round. Thank you! Next up is our nation's star, Hyun Sook! Hello, everyone! Hula, hula, hula... Where are you going? Nowhere! Come back! Why you! Do I have to wear this? I didn't know, sir. They didn't say. This is crazy! He's not Yu Jae-seok. You said he's a famous TV host Yu Jae-seok, my butt! I don't believe this! Hey! I should fire you, you idiot. Come on, sir. Who else would help you but me? Why you little! What's with you today, sir? How dare you! This is amazing. What is it? This is big right now. I just played note after note like this. I look forward to your next performance. Here's to Jung Band's hot TV debut! Bottoms up! - Congratulations! - Bottoms up! I saw the show. You play the piano really well. Well, thank you. Mister? Do you like my aunt? - Huh? - No way. He likes her. Then why do you play with my aunt? We're not playing... We're in a band together. You little twerp! Thanks, Mom! I was so surprised! I'm surprised... Han! Why didn't you tell us? I almost fainted seeing you on TV. Goodness. I had no idea you had such talent. Oh, please. Is that what you're wearing on TV? What TV? Didn't they tell you? They've been waiting since morning. Come in. It's been a long time, Jin-woo. Who's Jin-woo? I thought you looked familiar at the lecture. I still had these at home. Amazing, huh? I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about. Of course you do. Do you have amnesia? Memory Whiz Kid? I said it's not me! It's not me. It's not. I swear. 70193852110555964... (1983) That's great. As you know, there is no end to pi. Our show will be over before he can recite all this. Now, the 612th decimal point? 612th... Five. Five? Five! Amazing! This boy is Korea's future! For the only girl who is exactly like you Like me You're lonely Mister! I decided on our next song. How about "Plan Man"? Something else? I'm sorry. But I can't go on. Is something wrong? Well, I... I hate people noticing me. Mister... Got something to hide? No... Fine! Let's just quit. We're a team. - I'm really sorry. - It's okay. I wanted to just audition anyway. I'm serious. What about you? Almost done changing things? Well... (I'LL KILL YOU IF YOU TAKE THIS DOWN!) Stray cats are unfriendly. Come here. So this one must've had a home. Maybe he was abandoned. Maybe he just got lost. Anyway, he's very lucky. Because he met me. What are you doing? No! Stay back! Touch it. Third. You can't touch dirty things. That's not just dirty! It's dangerous! You could get toxoplasma from cat parasites! You could get meningitis, retina degeneration, and go blind! Where did you hear things like that? I have 1.8 and 2.0 vision! Here! Anything but that! I can't! So-jung! Put it down! What are you doing? I'm ready to pay! Coming! I'll be right there! Hold it for a sec. So-jung! Thank you. Mister? What happened? You peed your pants? Mister! Cat parasites! He could be infected! Meningitis... retina degeneration... What if he goes blind? He's just in shock. Don't worry. What grown man pees his pants? Mister! He's alive! Can you see me? It's me! Where am I going? Mister! Wait! We're going to the hospital. Dry cleaning! I have to go! Mister! Normally, he's not that weird. How did you end up peeing your pants? I didn't pee my pants! Yeah, right. I saw everything. I didn't! It's not my pee! Don't worry. I won't tell. I didn't pee my pants! It's not mine! Why are you yelling? I won't tell. It's our secret. You, too! Sure. Why is she talking to goldfish? Didn't you go a bit overboard? How can you faint because of cat pee? Someone died from pigeon poop. No way! I'm serious. Someone saw it. Such a liar. But... Yes, Chief. Han! I heard you're sick. I'm sorry. I'm on my way. It's okay. Go home and rest. Chief! Want applause? Hold on. Han is leaving work early! Really? Wow! - Way to go, Han! - Bye! Did you get in trouble? No, I got congratulated. What? Are you out of your mind? Are you crazy? How can you sing that on TV? How can you be so stupid? Hey! I'm talking to you. Hey! What are you doing? You're a celebrity. Stay back, Mister. I came for my bag. Please leave. Do you still love me? Is that what this is about? I'm surprised. So-jung. This is for your own good. No one believes you. You're digging your own grave. Don't you get it? You think they'll be on your side singing that on TV? Don't worry. I quit. Really? Great! Good thinking. If you kept going, they'd just call you crazy. You have no chance of winning anyway. Excuse me. We're not quitting. Scram. Get out! This is no place for you to butt in. That's true. I know that. But we're entering the second round. Look. I know you got dragged into this because she has no one else. It's no use mixing with someone like her. You'll regret it. I won't! From head to toe, I was born to rock. It's my dream. Whatever. Dreaming fools. We'll see what happens. Are you okay? It's that girl. Yes, the weird one. Mister? What? I've become weird these days. You were always weird. No, I mean weird in a different way. If you became weird from weird, doesn't that make you normal now? We appreciate your courage. It's Mr. Han Jung-seok's turn. - Did you all watch the show? - Yes. It was so touching. I bragged to my friends that I know you. Oh, please. I've been having dreams these days. Maybe it's because I don't set alarms. Mom! Mom... We appreciate your courage. You all know the next class is our last, right? Yes. These are invitation cards. Pass them around. As I told you, we're having a recital. Just be yourselves. But you must not come alone. Bring someone to show how you've changed. Okay? - Yes. - Great. What's this? Oh, So-jung. An invitation? Yes, it is. To give to Ji-won? Yes, but I'm thinking... Ma'am, wait! I need to... What's this? Ask him. It's an invitation. Go! Watch a movie together. - What? - Pardon? You can get off work. So-jung can watch the store. Go ahead. Go watch a movie with him. A movie? Sure. A movie. Your therapy class sounds fun. The doctor is unique and has severe depression. Still, I guess she's quite competent. You've changed these days. Really? I've done many new things these days. Being late, leaving work early... I even tried tripe. It looks dirty, but it's pretty good. So-jung even eats raw liver. You've changed a lot, too. I'm still not used to it. It's my first time. And your hands? Here. They've gotten a lot better. But it's really hard. I didn't think it'd be so hard not to wash my hands. I heard it's hard to change. If changing was easy, we wouldn't be humans. Your doctor said that? No, So-jung said it. - So-jung said that. - Tickets, please. We'd better go in. I think you've changed... But not because of a competent doctor. Pardon? Give this to the one you really want to. It's great. Honestly, I can't stand sitting beside someone in theaters. Thanks for the tickets. What's our song for the second round? What? What are we singing in the second round? How is "Plan Man"? No! Go stronger! Put the jerk's name in this time. Forget it. I don't care about him. Let's just move on and go our way. Right. Our way... This may not be fun, but... If you have time... Why? Ji-won's busy? Huh? No. It's just... I think it'll be better if you come. You came back to give me this? What about the movie? Ji-won said she likes watching movies alone. No way. It's true. She went in alone. Well, I'll just get going. Look at the time. I should sleep. I'd better go. Bye. Bye. Plan Man! Plan Man! So you set an alarm and plan Like him Like me What looks good? This one? This one? Which one? This flower pattern? This is better, right? You're crazy. It's for the next round. Who is it? Ta-da! Hi, Mister! But why are you here? Don't touch anything! Did you wash your hands? It's too clean that I feel bad walking around. I'm so sorry. What are you doing here? Our second audition is soon. We should prepare with this! Ta-da! You should be thankful I gave you my time You look so serious as if you're on a quiz show. You look awkward, too. Whatever. What should I do with the money? $200,000? If I win that... First, I'll buy a car! No! I'll get a new guitar. No! I'll go on a trip! - No! - What should I do first? I'll spread it on the floor and roll in it! They'll deduct taxes. It'll be $8,800. Then we'll get $191,200. Divide that by two. $9,560 each. I'm saving it. You calculated all that? It's good to be accurate. I'm hot! It feels nice out here! That's my seat. His bones will rot like that. What? Who? He's in high school, but he always smokes there. His mom has never caught him. Must be good at studying. What? Smart students usually don't get caught. Right. He must be smart. An elderly couple lives in that apartment. They always sleep with the TV on. Electromagnetic waves are bad. My mom does that, too. That's not healthy. It's okay. Look! He drank again. He's drunk. Isn't it fun? Watching how people live? It's just normal. Right. It's normal... But... When I watch them, some of them must be watching me, too. When they see me living alone like this, what will they think? That I'm weird? It's not weird. They'd probably just think you can't sleep. I can't sleep? Yup. Right. I guess. He's the Memory Whiz Kid? This is big! Isn't it? If my live show didn't go wrong back then... I still have nightmares about that day. Sir. Let us cover this one. But you've got to let me in big. Catch my drift? Of course! If this works out, you can make a comeback. Producer Seo! Saw the viewer comments? There are stupid rumors going around because of that girl! Why do I have to hear that kind of crap? Delete all the bad stuff. Or I'm off the show! I won't stand for this. There's nothing to worry about. You owe me drinks. What? Lost your mind? He'll clear up everything. Who's that? That's why I'll make it I'll give you a pass. - Thank you! - Congratulations. Good job. Jung Band is up next! Remember to say what I told you. Right this way. Any comments today? We'll rock! Go Jung Band! Make sure. I'm ready. Hello. - Again, our song is based on... - Wait. Before you sing... The song you sang last time, you said it's from personal experience? So you really dated a married man? - Why are you bringing that up... - Wait. Our website is filled with comments on that. Ms. Yoo So-jung? Is that why your band left you? But he lied about being married. Hold on. You really dated him not knowing he was married? I heard you chased him around knowing that. That's not true. Isn't that why your former band left you? Word travels fast here! She said she didn't know! Why keep asking? Turn the camera off. - Byeong-soo. - Bro... Now! Stay out, piano man! What are you? Her lawyer? Wake up! You're being used by her, too. Her? Everyone knows she's crazy! She said she didn't know! You're really something. Think you can mess with me? Here! Memory Whiz Kid! You were the talk of the town back then. An IQ over 200? You went on TV and lied! You're supposed to go study in the States or something? But now, you're a librarian? Did you hide in the library because you're embarrassed? I heard you're seeing a shrink. Went nuts because you're too smart? You and your mom went on TV and put on a scam! You lying bastard! - Let go! - Mister! Stop it! Are you crazy? Stop filming! Kick them out! Mister! Mister! Let's talk! Why didn't you tell me? If I knew, we wouldn't have entered. You could've told me. What if I did? What would that change? I was the Memory Whiz Kid in the past. Does that change? I'm obsessive-compulsive and seeing a shrink! Will that change? Why are you doing this? You thought me being like this was amusing. That's why you used me, like he said! That's not true. Then why? Why couldn't you say anything back to him? You said we'd move on. I didn't want to stand before the public. But I went there to forget and move on our way. But... That's not it. I just... I know! You're a good person. You're a nice person. But you being nice can be bad for folks like me. That's not being nice. It's being easy. Did you really not know he was married? I'm sorry. Maybe I am. Do you remember this boy? An 8-year-old genius with an IQ over 200. He has an innately superb brain. His brainwave activity is 20 times greater than others. Memory Whiz Kid, who shocked the nation in 1983. Memory Whiz Kid? I could never forget him. How can you play so well? Just play note after note like this. Just play them in order. He makes his appearance on "Survival Hot Band"! I just played note after note like this. The talk of the town! Jung Band! Married man What do his colleagues think of him? So annoying. After we first shook hands, he wiped them with a sanitizer. He's kind of an outcast. He has no clue what people mean. There was a bad incident, but he was a true genius. But the genius boy had rather a simple dream. How do you feel about having such a remarkable son? I'm proud of him. I can't wait to see what he becomes. I want to run a dry cleaner's with my mom. The Memory Whiz Kid's next challenge! Mister! But perhaps it's not time for him to face the world. Still can't reach Han? Still no answer, sir. Then go to his house. No one knows where he lives? You worked with him for years! How can you say that on TV? You should stick up for your colleagues. We didn't mean to, sir. They edited it intentionally. That's right. I said he was annoying at first, but not now. I said he's a good colleague with lots to learn from. I said he was weird at first, but not anymore! That's what I said. You shouldn't have given them anything. Like me! I got completely edited out! Is Han Jung-seok here? Not at work yet? We're from the TV station. - Please leave. - We'd like an interview. - Forget it. Please leave. - Just 5 minutes! - Han's not here. - It'll take a minute. - Please go! - Mr. Han! He can't be reached. The library won't let us in, either. Let's just go with Magnet Man. Sir? Your show's being revived after 30 years. We need the first guest to have a huge impact. You've lost your touch. If we don't get good ratings, it'll get canned. Jung-seok's not answering? Without alarms, maybe he slept in. Can you put it up more? (WE APPRECIATE YOUR COURAGE) It's up too high. Han would be good at this. Why didn't you pick them up? Must I come myself? I forgot. How long will you stay like this? I don't know what to do. What do you normally do at this hour? Will you give up everything? The girl's smudge won't come out. I won't charge you. Dry cleaning! Dry cleaning! Pigeons scare me the most in the world. I'll face my fears today. Thank you! Sir? Do we have to do this? We should film what we can of him for the show. What if he doesn't come?

What's your secret? There's no secret. Well... Maybe a good eye for things? Discovering people's hidden talents. And looking for the will to work hard. Kids these days... Excuse me. What are you doing? Are you okay? There! Now, it's not so unfair to be called crazy! What's that crazy woman saying? I take courage in reciting... A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P... I take courage in shouting... Jung-seok! I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay. You've been late before. Go on in. Okay. Courage is like a baby's murmur... I'm sorry, Mom. You don't have to tell me not to get mad anymore. I tend to get angry a lot more than others. But it's not because I hate them. It's because I'm angry with myself. I can't suddenly change everything. But I'll try hard to change one step at a time. I love you. He had the courage to be late today. Here's Mr. Han Jung-seok. This place is... His friend just arrived. Let's give him a big hand.

I don't want to go, Mom. What do you mean? Are you nervous? I want to stay here with you. This is a great opportunity for you. You promised me you can do this. Jin-woo. Look at me. What's our plan? To go to the States and become a great person. And come back successful. Right. You're doing great, Jin-woo. That's right. Listen to your mom. See those people waving over there? They're the ones who will pick out the questions. Got it? Now, let's practice. What's the 9,966th decimal point? Nine. Good. And the 5,212th? Three. You've got it, kid. Those are the questions today. You understand me? Mom... Jin-woo, it's not lying. You already know it. Today's special guest is Korea's genius boy! Memory Whiz Kid! Let's give him a big hand! Here's today's challenge!

The man in the hat there. - Hi. - Pick a number please? 9,966th, please. 9,966th! Can Jin-woo, our Memory Whiz Kid, get it right? Don't tell him, folks. Four.

Five. He keeps getting it wrong. Jin-woo? Think carefully and try again. Seven. Jin-woo... Zero. I don't know. What? It's a hoax! It's live TV. Please don't speak out like that. I knew it! It's rigged! This is crazy! Koo Sang-yoon's a liar! No, I'm not. You think TV is a joke? Please calm down. Please calm down. I was too scared to go to the States alone. I was just 8 years old. I had no other choice. I thought that was my only way out. Mommy... What's with your nails? Let's go home and cut them. Look at the boy. It's not his fault. It's the mom's! She made him like that. How does my pee taste? You liar! What are you doing? Oh, no. Look, lady! They're just playing. What? Acting all haughty... So, you taught your kid to lie? - My son is not... - Ma'am! One word, please! Was it all rigged? What about his scholarship to the States? One word, please! Is it true? Was it a lie from the start? No! That's not true! Tell us the truth! My son is not like that! Jin-woo! Mom... I'm sorry, Mom. Look, Mom... I'll cut my nails clean. I won't stain my clothes. I won't touch dirty things. I'll clean up my desk. I'll listen to you, Mom. I'll do everything you tell me to. Mom... So please... Jin-woo. It's okay. It's not your fault. It's okay, Jin-woo. Don't cry. I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't want to be separated from you. I wanted to stay with you. I'm the one who's sorry. I'm sorry I didn't know how you felt. It must've been so hard for you. It was... I've been so scared, Mom. So scared... It's all right now. It's okay, Jin-woo. I'm sorry, Mom. He's got some story. It's not what we planned for the show. But this is way better, sir! You'll be back on top in no time! Let's forget it. What? Why? Sir! Let's leave him alone. But this is your big chance to make it back! Will you do road shows all your life? You could make it back. So-jung... Yes? It's raining. Oh, no! Do you have an umbrella? No, I didn't check the weather forecast. - Mister? - Yes? - Run! - What? - But... - Hurry! Run! Wait up! Are you okay? Let's share. Run! Hurry! - Mister? - Yes? You must want to go to the dry cleaner's. It's okay. This is nothing. Oh, really? It's okay. It stopped. Right. I'll return this. I don't need it. What's the alarm at this time? It's my bedtime alarm. I don't need it now. - I'd better get going. - What? Goodbye, then. But I... Wait! Hold on! I'm sorry. I shouldn't be doing this here. But I'm not going to plan this. You've never set alarms, right? - Right. - You have no sense of planning. You touch dirty things. You're messy and totally different from me. So different and strange. But still... What? I... I like you. You call that a confession? Calling me messy and strange? Think I'll accept you like that? Right... I'll plan it next time. When do you kiss your girlfriend? What? Doesn't "Plan Man" plan for that? No, I haven't planned that... Are you okay? Mister? Was that your first kiss? Mister! Are you all right? Mister! Wake up! Why do you always faint? Mister! Mister! Help me! Mister! Open your eyes! Mister! Do you need to go to the dry cleaner's? What happened? Mister!
