- He turned into something... black and dark, and he attacked me. - What? Who are you talking about? Okay. It's okay. It was just a little nightmare. Tom's fine. - What? How did you know it was Tom in my dream? I never said. I need you close to me. Can you stay home with me today? - Dad, I'm worried about you. It's been 20 years since Mom died, and you still haven't healed. I mean, look at how you obsess about our health conditions. You need to get back into biotech research. - Grandpa. - Oh, Tommy. I am sorry. I'm sorry I scared you. - Aah. Dad, don't worry. It's just a scratch. He's still obsessed about Mom's cancer. I mean, If I tell him we could just get regular check-ups anywhere, he blows up. Tom, come back. No, it's fine. He'll be all right. Yuriko, we'll be home soon. Tom! Tom, stand by the wall. Tom! Stand by the wall! Stay there! - Raah! - Tom! Tom! Tom! - Dad! - Tom! - Dad! Daddy! - You should eat a little. - How can you be so calm, sitting there eating breakfast? Your son was just murdered! He's dead! Don't you want to find him? Don't you want to kill him, just like he killed Tom? - d Hush, little baby d d Don't say a word d d Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird d Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I know exactly how Yuriko feels, Dad. I can't forgive. I can't move on. - Anthony, please, don't even think about revenge. d Hush, little baby d d Don't say a word d d Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird d You said Mom used to sing this lullaby all the time. Remember you told me to sing it whenever I was angry? Dad, I sang it every time. Should I have done that? - Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. - Mitsue. - You once told me about a strange feeling you get sometimes, as if your mind and your body don't belong to you. I have a strange feeling too. I feel as if... outside this apartment, nothing exists. I only feel alive when you hold me tight. I felt more alive... when I gave birth to Tom. I was so happy then. - You're going out? - I'm going to find Tom's killer. - Uh... Yuriko, come back. Come back to me. Yes, the document you need for the presentation is almost finished. I'll email it right away. Print out 20 copies. Yes. - Hi, Anthony. It's me. I've just been told that we don't have that document from you yet. It's very important, you know. I fully realize this is a bad time for you, but can you make it today? [Speaking Japanese] Yes. - [Speaking Japanese] It's delivery service. I've got your package. - [Speaking Japanese] Yes. [Speaking English] Yes, I'm sorry to have cut you off earlier. I dropped a pot of hot water, and I will send the document right away. - That's all right, Anthony. Don't worry about it. The marketing department needs it, so if could you get... Anthony is there something wrong with your... [Speaking Japanese] Please leave it there. - [Speaking Japanese] I leave this here, and I need your signature. Thank you. Here's a copy. - [Speaking English] The signs are there. Request immediate disposal. The informant was right. - [Speaking Japanese] Dead already? I thought that you'd get a lot more out of... [speaking English] Your son showed more fight when I ran him over. - You killed Tom! d Hush, little baby d d Don't say a word d - Subject is now in parking garage. Transformation proceeding. - Any witnesses? - Only the four of us, I think. d Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring d d If that diamond ring turns brass d d Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass d - Please leave a message. - Welcome to your new life. I hope you're enjoying it. - Who are you? - A pair of eyes. I see everything, you and your family. I could even tell you Tom's favorite dessert. - Why did you kill Tom? - I stumbled on your dad's secret. That's where this all started. Check your mail. "Tetsu." "Tetsu Tetsuo." - Hello, hello, hello. We are glad you could make the journey to join us. - Welcome to the newest chapter in the history of iron. Dad, what did you do to me? What did you do? - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! "Tetsu Tetsuo" "At long last, my dream is in sight. "The human body is the natural world's "most beautiful and functional work of art. "I am making an artificial body "not to improve on that work of God, "but to understand it better. "Mitsue did everything she could to help me, "until she found out what fearsome powers an artificial body could have." I believed that we were making androids that would help improve human life. But look at what we've created. They all have the ability to transform into powerful weapons. I never wanted to create weapons, Mitsue. But it was the only way we could bring investment to the company. - Human weapons, Ride? No. I won't do it anymore. Please, Ride, tell me you'll stop this work too. - "My theories on the creation of an artificial body "and Japanese transformer technology "caught the eye of an American corporation, "which combined the two into the Tetsuo Project." "Tetsuo Tetsu" "But fearing criticism "over its moral and other implications, "the corporation suddenly cancelled the project, "and tried to eliminate all traces "of it ever having existed. "It was right at that time we discovered that Mitsue had cancer. "She had always wanted a child. "We had never been able to have one. I did not want to lose her." What am I? Is my dad some kind of perverted freak? He had sex with an android? d Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat d d And if that billy goat won't pull d d Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull d d If that cart and bull turns over d d Mama's gonna buy you a dog named Rover d d And if that dog named Rover won't bark d d Mama's gonna buy you a horse and cart d d And if that... d - Anthony. Anthony. That man emailed me. He told me to come here. I'm begging you for the last time. We have to find who killed Tom, and we have to kill him. We have to kill him, Anthony. That's the only way I can be happy again. I need to feel alive, Anthony. I had forgotten what life felt like until Tom was born. Now that he's gone, I'm so scared I will lose this feeling again. I'm scared I'll forget my little boy and how he made me feel. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of killing the man who took him from me. - Leave me alone! - Anthony? What's happening? - I have a demon inside of me. - Anthony. - No. You can't come near me! - The wife is in the house. No sign of Dr. Stoval. - Our information checks out. The informant appears to be a hacker and the same man who killed the boy for reasons unknown. Word of this must never get out. Do not involve the police under any circumstances. Detain Dr. Stoval and the informant if he appears. Anthony is transforming. Destroy him and his wife as well, if that becomes necessary. - Where is Anthony? Anthony! Show yourself. Show yourself, or your wife dies, just like your son. Coward. What kind of man are you? Your son is murdered, your wife tortured, and you do nothing. Yuriko, you should have married a real man. - Retreat! Retreat! - So Anthony wouldn't kill any of you? - Who in the hell are you? - Your company would know nothing about Ride's experiments if not for me. Call me an informant. - Status report, Agent One. What happened? - [Whispers] I terminated Anthony. - I terminated Anthony. - Are Ride and the informant secured? - [Whispers] Not yet. Please keep searching. - Not yet. Please keep searching. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. - Don't come any closer. Even now, I'm not sure if I can control myself from not killing you. I need to be with Tom. It's what's best for everyone. - Anthony, don't! I can't even kill myself. - What's wrong with you? What are you doing? - Were you just gonna leave me alone? - d Hush, little baby d d Don't say a word d d Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird d d If that mockingbird won't sing d d Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring d d If that diamond ring turns brass d d Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass d d If that looking glass gets broke d d Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat d d If that billy goat won't pull d d Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull d Where are you, Ride? Hello? - Some guy locked me in a closet here in the house. He's just let me out. I'm in the dining room. I have something to tell you both. - Yuriko, you need to... - Don't tell me to stay here. I'm coming with you. - What's happening here, Dad? Talk to me. Dad. What's this about? - I've always worried that this would happen to you, Anthony, that your... anger would turn you to iron. - Why did you do it? - Your mother begged me to do this... Before her lights went out. She was so dead-set against this project. I don't know what made her suddenly change. - When I die, dissect me. Look at me. Look at my whole body: My hair, my skin, my insides, my bones. Don't miss any part of me. Then build your android of me. Make love to the android. Make a baby. I know you say that anger triggers the transformation, but it won't happen to me. As long as I have a child, I'll always be happy. I will never become a human weapon. I know it, Ride. Please. Build my android replica. I can never give up my dream to have a child. Dad, who did this? The men from the company? - No, no, not them. It was the one, the man who took my secrets. - That guy! - The android Mitsue, she didn't live very long. You and Tom have android DNA, so I was always afraid the same thing would happen to you both. Anthony, your body is a weapon whose destructive power grows the angrier you get. Never let that anger get out of control. Swear you'll do that. - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Ladies and gentlemen... let's party. [Speaking Japanese] No, I'm not going to end it with a cheap shot like this. What I want, Anthony, is for you to show the stupid people of this world what life is really like. Brains and blood splattering. That's reality. Come on, Anthony, destroy all of our lazy peaceful dreams. [Speaking English] Awaken to your destiny. - This war isn't over until I kill him. - He knows how to hurt you, Anthony. He knows everything about us. - This is the battle you were hoping for. - Anthony. I'm pregnant. I would have told you, but after what happened to Tom, I couldn't. This has to stop. I was wrong. No more killing. - Look at me. Look at what my body has become. My blood is polluted. I don't want to bring a baby into this world with my genetics. No child can be happy living like me. - Our baby will. I want this baby, Anthony. - It's him. - Anthony. - So beautiful. - Come on. Come over here. Aim that big gun of yours right at me. Go ahead. Do it, Anthony. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it! - Okay, then. - Allow me to drag your anger out of you. - Ah. Yes. I hear it. The pulse. You know, the heartbeat of a new life. Put it on her. Put it on her. - You know what this pretty thing is, don't you? It's a bomb. Come on now, Anthony. Let's play one last little game. In one minute, I will push this button. You have two choices. Number one... Kill me. That way, you save your wife and the child that she will have. But that means the monster lives on. Choice number two: I blow them both to pieces. No more little monster. The world will have peace. Well... are you ready to ride, cowboy? You have 60 seconds. Go! - Anthony. Where are you? 30 seconds left. How are you doing, cowboy? Where are you? - 15 seconds to go, minuteman. - Too late. Bye-bye, lovely Yuriko. - Destroy the world with your love. Seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... - Your enemy is not that man! Your enemy is in your mind! What are you doing? Shoot me! Shoot me, Anthony! This isn't what you want! You don't want me inside you! You don't know what I'll do. - d Hush, little baby d d Don't say a word d d Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird d d If that mockingbird won't sing d d Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring d d If that diamond ring turns brass d d Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass d d If that looking glass gets broke d d Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat d - You don't know what I'll do. - Are you ready? - Almost ready. Hey. - Let's go. - You know, today I can't be late. - Why is that? - My first presentation. - Oh, yeah? - As technology manager at the company. - That's great. - Hey! Elliott! - Do you have everything? - Yes! - All right. Let's go. - We're going to the park tomorrow. We'll have sandwiches, and we'll get your favorite ice cream. - Yeah! - Come on! No, wait. You guys, I got it. Stop. You guys, this guy right here. This guy. Go on.
