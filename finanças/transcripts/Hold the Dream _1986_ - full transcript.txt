(light music) - No. Come and sit here. I want to talk to you, Shane. - [Shane] All right. - Cheers. - Cheers. - I want to ask you a question. - Go on. - Will you promise to tell me the truth? - That depends on the question. If I don't like it I might be evasive. - You and I always told each other the truth when we were children, Shane. I'd like it to be like that between us again. - But it is. - No, not really. And last year, when I asked you about your absence from my life, you brushed me off with silly excuses. Pressure of work, living abroad. I never really believed you in my heart of hearts. And that brings me on to my question. - Which is? - What awful thing did I do to you to drive you out of my life? You were my oldest and dearest friend. Shall I answer it for you? You dropped me because I became engaged to Jim then married him. - I thought Jim would resent me if I was around and you would too. You didn't need no chum loitering about on your doorstep. - Shane, you're not telling me the truth. You know that. And so do I. (airy music) - All the years I've waited for you. All my life. - [Paula] I love you, Shane. - When did you discover how you felt about me? - Uh-uh. - The truth, remember? - Last night. In the kitchen. - The kitchen? - Perhaps it has some hidden sexual meaning. - Paula? - Uh huh? - I've always had this golden rule, no married women. I never wanted to take a woman who belonged to another man. - I think I belong to myself. - Of course you do. - I wouldn't be here, Shane, if my marriage was working. - I know that. - I ought never to have married him but, and now there are the twins. What am I going to do? How can we ever sort all of this out, Shane? - I don't know. We'll just take each day as it comes. - Jim is stubborn. He can be very difficult. He'll never let me go. - Madam, your flight's ready for boarding now. - Thank you. - [Woman] British Airways announce the departure of supersonic concord flight number BA194 to London. All passengers on this flight should proceed now to gate number five, thank you. - Paula. You do want to marry me, don't you? - Oh yes, Shane. - Well then. We'll work it out. And you trust that. Trust my love for you. (melancholy music) (zooming) - It's me, Nora. No, I just got back from New York. How's Lauren? And Tessa? (laughing) Oh good. Is Mr. Fairley there? Oh, he did leave early. No, no, no it's all right. I'll speak to him when he gets to the paper. Thank you Bert. - [John] Good morning, Mrs. Fairley. See you. - Good morning, John. Right. There are a few phone calls I must make then I'm going to shower, change and then we'll deal with all this, right? - Fine. - Oh, Mr. Fairley please. Hello Alice, it's Mrs. Fairley. Is he there? Ah, all right. Just tell him I'm back from New York and he can call me at the store in London. - Good morning Mrs. Fairley. - Ron, good morning. I don't like the men's cardigans display. - Oh I'll get the team to right it. - Good. Morning, Mrs. Askalov. Nice to see you back. - Good morning Mrs. Fairley. - Yes. Yeah. Hang on a bit, hang on. Sam? Did you kill that Cardiac Council lead thing? - Certainly am. - Well this gentleman, go and tell him that. - Hello ,can I help you? - Excuse me sir. - What's this? Oh yes, yeah I'll deal with this. Thanks a lot. Yeah, Mrs. Fairley please, Gaye. Paula darling, it's me. Look, I'm driving down to London. I should get in about eight o'clock, and I have booked a table at Marks for nine. - But you knew I was driving to Yorkshire tonight, Jim. I want to see the twins. - Yeah but we haven't spent any time together lately. We could have a lovely evening out just like the old times. - Jim, darling, I'm dying to see the twins. Why can't we have dinner at home? - I've been feeling awful since we had our row and I want you all to myself for once. You can drive back to Yorkshire with me tomorrow evening. I'll see you in a couple of hours in the flat. (clicking) (zooming) (honking) (zooming) (honking) (tires screeching) (revving) (honking) (crashing) (ominous music) - Mrs. Fairley? I'm Dr. Anderson. (beeping) - How serious is it, Doctor? - There's a fracture of the lumbar spine with probable nerve damage. But there's some movement. There's also a severe fracture to the left wrist, cracked ribs and obviously cuts and bare bruising. So it's serious. - Is there any internal damage? - Not so far as we know but we're still monitoring. Of course there are still tests to be done after he's out of anesthetic. Neurological tests. (light music) (phone ringing) - Yes? - [Shane] It's me, Shane. - Oh, thank God. I thought it was the hospital. Oh. You don't know, do you? - Yes, I do. Winston rang me. How is he, Paula? - [Paula] Lucky to be alive. - And how are you? - Oh, confused, upset. - Do you want me to fly over? - [Paula] No, of course not. Thank you, Shane. - I love you. Paula? - Shane? I won't be able to speak to Jim about the divorce. Not for some months. - I know that. But I've waited all these years for you, what's a few months longer? (dramatic music) - So who do you think should run the papers while Jim's out of action? - Sam Fellowes. He's acted as Editor-in-Chief before in Jim's absence. - Why give Sam all the power? - Oh come on Paula, that's not like you. Holding a grudge just because he played the male chauvinist. - Holding a grudge? I simply feel that if the power and the responsibility are to go outside the family, it should be split. I move we let Fellowes run the morning gazette and Pete Smythe the evening standard. - Not a bad idea, Winston. - A damn good idea. I second it. - Well are we all agreed? - Absolutely. - Brilliant as usual, Paula. I'm in favor. - Sarah? - Oh yes, it's fine with me. - That's settled then. Jonathan, what's happening about that office block in Hoben? - The final figure is above my limit so I'll need a vote at the next meeting. - Have you sorted out the problems at the Leeds factory? - Yes. Next summer's line is finally in production. We'll be able to ship on time, Uncle David. - Well that's good. Well unless any of you has anything special to report, I think we can close this meeting. - [Emily] Paula. What have you done about Jonathan? - We know that he and Sebastian Cross meet regularly. - What do you think he's up to? - I don't know he's done anything. But the regular audit is coming up soon so we're going to take a special look at all of his transactions. - And it was early afternoon when Constable Kennedy spoke to the doctor who set the time of death somewhere between 10:30 and 11 on the previous night, sir. - Thank you Sergeant. Tell me, did you at that time form an opinion as to the cause of Lady Dunvale's death? - Well at first I thought her Ladyship's death was an accident. But later I began to wonder if it wasn't foul play. - I swear that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God. - Lord Dunvale. Will you give the court your opinion of the deceased's state of mind prior to her tragic death? - My wife and I were separated and about to divorce. Lately, when she visited Clonlochlan, I began to realize that she had changed. She was very irrational at times and I was concerned about her. - Did she ever mention suicide during these spells of irrationality? - Certainly not. My wife would not have killed herself whatever her state of mind. I'm convinced that her death was an accident. - [Judge] You were the housekeeper at Clonlochlan house, Miss O'Donnell? - Yes, I am sir. - Do you agree with Lord Dunvale about her state of mind? - Yes sir. And no sir. - [Judge] Would you explain that please? - Well I agreed that she was irrational. More than that, on one occasion she was hysterical. And she had been drinking. But I don't agree about her not killing herself. She told me several times that she'd nothing to live for and she wished she were dead. (tense music) I'm sorry. - [Judge] Please continue, Miss O'Donnell. - The last time I saw her, she-- - [Judge] When was that? - The day before her death. She actually threatened to put an end to her life. - That can't be so. - She said it was over anyway. She was barren and her marriage was a failure. - [Judge] Did you mention by chance to anyone? - No, I didn't sir. I hoped to talk to Lord Dunvale after he took the Dowager Countess home after dinner but well, it was too busy, and, - He was busy on Saturday night? - Yes sir. Doing his books in the library. - What time was this, Miss O'Donnell? - Well sir, I'd listen to the news in my room so it would have been after 10 o'clock. I came down to make a pot of tea and-- - [Judge] What time did you go up again? - [Miss O'Donnell] Near enough 11 o'clock sir. - And Lord Dunvale was still working? - [Miss O'Donnell] Yes. - I still can't believe Min killed herself. It had to be an accident. - Darling, the pathologist said she had alcohol in her blood and barbiturates. I'm sure the coroner's verdict was the right one. - Did you believe Bridgette O'Donnell? - What? You don't think Anthony was involved in Min's death here? - No of course not. I mean Anthony wouldn't hurt a fly. It's just, that woman, oh. - Jim! You're out of bed at last. - Yes, isn't it wonderful? A few weeks in this damned chair and I'll be back on my feet again. - You'll be able to come home soon, won't you? - Any day now. Look, Paula, I know I've said this already but I'm so sorry about the crash. There's no excuse really except that I was in a tearing hurry to see you when you arrived back from New York. - Jim, you're on painkillers. Do you really think you ought to be drinking? - Don't fuss, darling. Anyway I'm not on painkillers now. And I prefer this. - I've spoken to Winston. Everything seems to be going smoothly at the newspapers. - Yes I've spoken to Sam myself. Look. Let's forget about that dreadful row we had before you went to New York, hmm? Let's forget about our difficulties and start all over again. - Jim. - Lying there I've had lots of time to think. And I'd been planning our future together. - I wanted to talk to you too. I don't think we have-- - Mrs. Fairley. I just looked in to warn you not to overdo things, Mr.Fairley. How do you feel? - I feel great. - When will my husband be able to come home, Doctor? - Within the next few days. There's a couple of things I'd like to discuss with you about that, Mrs. Fairley. Could you spare me a few minutes? - Back in a minute, Jim. (light music) - I'm worried about your husband. - I thought you said all the tests were negative. No complications, no internal injuries. - That's correct. It's his drinking, what's behind it. - I don't understand you. - He's very volatile, Mrs. Fairley. Confident one minute, overconfident even. And then suddenly he'll imagine an offense and become morose. - Please say it straight out, Doctor. - He shouldn't be allowed into any situation which will cause him stress or emotional strain. - Oh Sarah. I've just had the latest figures on your investment. Confidential, of course. - Yes, I understand. They are good. - Yes, you're getting a rather nice little dowry together there. - Yes, I am. When I saw Shane in New York recently he agreed I should invest in property. He even suggested I should ask your advice. - You didn't tell him about Stonewall Properties? - Good heavens no. That's our secret. (sultry music) - Shane. What are you doing here? - No, after we got off the phone last night I was so worried about you. - Oh, I'm sorry-- - Don't be, it's wonderful to see you again. I missed you so much. - I missed you too. - God, I want you. Why don't we go to my apartment? (buzzing) - Yes, Gaye? - [Gaye] It's Emily on the line, Mrs. Fairley. She wants to know what time she can see you tomorrow morning. You do have an opening at 11, is that all right? - That's fine. Thanks, Gaye. - What's happening with Jim? How is he? - The doctor thinks he needs psychiatric help. - That's going to be a long haul. - If I can just help to get him back on his feet I'll feel easy. It's hard on you, Shane. - We're gonna be together eventually for the rest of our lives. I'm gonna be very busy the next few days. I have to see the solicitors about Blackie's estate, but let's go away to Paris for the weekend. - I'm bringing Jim back from the hospital this weekend. We're going to be staying at Granny's until after Christmas. You all right? - [Jim] I'm fine, thanks, yeah. (revving) - [Winston] Hello. - Sorry I'm late. I stopped to see Paula and the brood. - And Jim, how is he? - Thirsty. - Did you see Aunt Emma? - She worries me, she's still so frail. - I'm afraid it'll be a long while before she's up to coping with a big wedding. - You're not going to put it off again? - No. But I was thinking. Why don't we have a quiet wedding? At Christmas? - On Christmas eve? Oh darling, how wonderful, what a super idea! - Whoah settle on, you'll frighten the horses. - [Paula] Thank you. - Mrs. Fairley, excuse me. Could I speak to you for a moment? - I'm sorry Mr. Cross, I'm rather a hurry. (Mr. Cross groaning) Are you all right? Richard give me a hand. - Just give me a moment. Oh, sorry about that. I'm going into hospital next week. Before I do, I have something very important to tell you. Please. - Of course. Come up to my office. - I started with nothing. Pulled myself up by my bootstraps. It was hard in those days. That's why I wanted my son to have a proper start, a good education. Can't stand treachery, Mrs. Fairley. Specially family treachery, thank you. (sighing) We lost everything. The company, the building, everything. - I'm so sorry. If I can do anything to help you. - No, no, that's not why I'm here. Come to the point. My son Sebastian has been milking my company, robbing me, cheating me. Things were so bad I had to sell the building for half a million pounds. - What? - Sebastian persuaded me it was the best deal he could get. - But it's worth a million pounds. I mean that's why we offered you two million pounds for Cross Communications. - I know that. It was a fair offer. But then, Emma Harte has always been fair. The building was bought by Stonewall Properties. A few weeks ago, I found out my son is Stonewall Properties. - Oh my god. - How could a son do that to his father? He must have despised me. (groaning) Stonewall Properties is doing very well, Mrs. Fairley not because of Sebastian, he doesn't have that sort of skill. Someone is putting deals his way. Someone experienced in property. I can't prove who this invisible partner is but I have my suspicions. - So have I. (zooming) I'm back. - Hello. Easy trip, was it? - Yes, not much traffic tonight. That certainly was always a favorite of yours, wasn't it? - Adam bought it. The Fairleys had all the wealth and the power in Yorkshire then. (tense music) - We're all prisoners, aren't we? Of the past. - The sins of the fathers? - We get saddled with them. Their failures and their success. - What are you saddled with? You've got everything. - I'm saddled with Grandy's success. Everybody expects me to be another Emma Harte and I'm not. Oh, I know you think I'm a cold carbon copy of Grandy. - I'm sorry I said that. - You meant it? - Yes. - Well there's one big difference. When she was my age, she had to succeed just to survive. Then she had her dream of an empire. She had something to strive for. I'm merely the caretaker. - [Jim] I'm afraid I was impulsive, Emma. And irresponsible. I shouldn't have resigned. - No, you shouldn't. - I haven't really been fair on Paula either. - In what way? - Well I've disappointed her. I've let her down, really. And you. - You want to be reinstated as managing director. Is that what you're saying? - Yes, Emma. - What's brought about this change of heart? - Pride. Family pride. Though I know that you own the newspapers now but my family built them up. I was thinking about the way my family lost everything. Seemed to me to be the time to stop throwing things away. It's not enough just to do the part of the job that's enjoyable. One has to shoulder responsibilities as well. Is it asking too much to give a second chance to a Fairley? - I never mix sentiment with business, Jim. But I'm not saying no. Let me think about it and I'll talk to Henry Rossiter after Christmas. - May I have the ring please? With this ring I thee wed. - With this ring I thee wed. - [Priest] With my body I thee honor. - With my body I thee honor. - [Priest] And all my worldly goods with thee I share. - And all my worldly goods with thee I share. - [Priest] In the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost, amen. (clapping) - Yes! (laughing) Well done! Save me a gigantic piece, will you? - [Woman] I do love weddings. Have you two set a date yet? - Not yet, Daisy. - We thought it'd just be better to wait till next summer. - Jim, are you all right? - I just spent far too long on my feet. - Would you like a bit of chair? - Yes, thank you. - Can I top that up for you? - No, no, no. - Here we are. - Shane must have been missing Yorkshire and his old friends. - Really? - Yes actually, I was thinking of having a party for him. Just a few friends, you know. Would you like to join us? - [Sarah] I could help you plan if you like. - Our first Christmas without him, Aunt Emma. - I miss him, Shane. Oh but I'm delighted that you're still entering Sapphire Bow in the Grand National. Blackie would have been so pleased. You're keeping the stables? - Yes. - One day you'll be living in Yorkshire again. - Maybe. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin and a child ♪ - Shall we join them? - Oh, no, no.

Is this what you're looking for? Belongs on the branch next to the red ball. Why don't you hang it on the tree, mother? Are you all right? - Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I was just remembering something. - I think I know what it is. You remember decorating another tree long ago. - Yes. - I haven't forgotten that dreadful Christmas either. I was eight years old. I was very spiteful to you. - Yes, you were. - Please. Forgive me for what I did to you. - You were such a little girl. So young. You didn't understand. - Please, I want you to forgive me. - Why of course I do. - You don't understand how much this means to me. - Edwina, you are my firstborn child. I have always loved you. However much you have doubted it. - I don't anymore I want us to be friends. - We are already. (light music) I wanted to give you this tomorrow on Christmas morning. But I'd like you to have it now. - Thank you. Oh mother, it's beautiful. I've never seen you wear it. - I never have. It belonged to your grandmother. Yes. It was Adele Fairley's. - Oh, hi. What was that? We're a Yorkshire paper and we always repeat, always carry one local story on the front page. Hmm? Yeah I'll call you back, bye. Oh dear. It's obviously time I got back to work. My newspapers need me. - You did say you wanted to see this again. - It was my great grandmother's. I'm certainly glad you got it back. - Back? - It always belonged to a Fairley. That used to belong to Adam Fairley. - Oh, I didn't know. - You and I missed out on a great heritage, Edwina. But at least the papers will be in Fairley hands again. - I'm not sure I follow you, Jim. - The children, my children. The papers will come to them and they're Fairleys. Just as you and I are, Edwina. Come on, let's go for a walk, I need some exercise. - Well have a look at this. - You're just the man I want to see. Come and join us for a stroll. - The leg's looking much better. - I feel bloody marvelous. I'll be back at work next week. - Oh that's good news. - Now listen. Paula had a pretty rotten time while I've been laid up. Once I make sure my newspapers are running smoothly I want to take her on a bit of a trip. - Jim, what a good idea. Where will you go? - Ah, that's where Shane comes in. - Me? - Yes, your hotels. Now where would you recommend that's a nice warm lazy place for a second honeymoon, eh, Barbados? - Barbados is lovely. - Jim, I want to talk. I want to talk about us. - I've made plans for us. A second honeymoon. - You told me you'd stop drinking. - I have. Champagne doesn't count. Now darling, where should we go? - It's just no point in trying to start again. You and I just aren't suited. - Don't be so silly, Paula. A few rows don't mean anything. - No, Jim. Jim, you've had too much to drink. - For heaven's sake. Don't nag me. - I'm only trying to help. You won't help yourself, you won't even let the doctors help you. - I don't need any help. I'm perfectly all right. - How would you know if you won't even see the psychiatrist? - Oh we're back on that, are we? Poor old Jim's mad. He ought to be locked away in a mental home. He's not fit to run the papers. Everything's his fault, it must be. Yes, he's only a Fairley, he's not good enough for the part. God, you're incredible! - And you Jim are your own worst enemy. - What's wrong? You know Paula, when something's not right, don't be afraid to let it go. Don't be afraid to end it whilst you're still young and can find someone else. - But I-- - Once Jim is controlling the papers again, and feeling secure, please, don't fall into the trap of staying together for the sake of the children. - Oh, Grandy. (zooming) (bird squawking) Do you ever feel that Grandy knows everything? - She's a wonderfully wise old gran. She told me I'd come back to live in Yorkshire. I had the feeling she knew about us. - She told me to end my marriage before it was too late to marry again. - We mustn't disappoint her. - I've tried talking to Jim. He won't listen. He just won't face the facts. - I'm afraid you're wasting your time trying. Paula, it's time to get legal advice. - I'll talk to Henry Rossiter. Look, there's Grandy. - I always feel closer to Paul when I'm up here. He wrote me a letter just before he, before he killed himself. I came up here the day I received it. - [Paula] Don't stay too long, Grandy. - No. It's time to go. - Good morning, Mrs. Harte. It is nice to see you again. - Good morning. Douglas. Thank you. (light somber music) (soft music) Paul? (groaning) - Grandy? Grandy, it's me. - I waited for you. - I'm here now. - I asked you to hold my dream. But you must also have a dream of your own, Paula. Paul. - Grandy. Darling Grandy. (sobbing) - The peace of god empasses all understanding. Keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and that of God and of his son Jesus Christ our Lord.

Ah, mother. - Hello dear. - Hello Dad. Dad, he's already in there, go see him.. - Of course, yes. - Good to see you again. She also said that I was to get the New York apartment which I most certainly intend selling. Investing the money in Stonewall? Come on. - The last time I saw Emma, she said she wanted no long faces, no sad songs after she was dead. She said she'd known the best and the worst in her extraordinary life. And there'd not been one dull moment. Now before I proceed, I would like to say that I personally mourn a very dear friend who was the most remarkable person I've ever known. Now I'll keep this all informal since you all know the contents of her will. She gave the full details last year. Her children, Edwina, Kit, Robin and Elizabeth will continue to receive the income from the trust funds she set up for them. The trusts that Emma Harte created for her grandchildren have also not been changed. However, just before her death, Emma added five codicils. I will read them. Codicil one. I do give to Shane O'Neill the sum of one million pounds in the form of a trust fund and the diamond ring given to me by his grandfather Blackie. Codicil two. I give to my great nephew Winston Harte the sum of one million pounds in the form of a trust and Harem's Nest, my house of Scarborough. To Winston, I also give 35% of the shares in my new Canadian newspaper company Consolidated International. Codicil three. To Jim Fairley, husband of my granddaughter Paula I give five percent of my shares in my new Canadian newspaper company. Codicil four. I give to my grandaughter Paula McGill Fairley 60% of the shares in my new Canadian newspaper company. Codicil five. I have decided that the properties bought for me by Paul McGill should rightfully go to his only child. I therefore give to my daughter Daisy my house in Belgrave Square and my duplex apartment in New York. - Just a minute. I'm gonna contest this will. - Please be so kind as to sit down, Jonathan. I've not finished. - Dad? Don't you have anything to say about this? - Oh this is hardly the-- - I realize that Jonathan and Sarah may feel some disappointment and so I give to each of them any two paintings they wish to select from my collection of French impressionists. (knocking) There's a final statement from Emma Harte. Should any member of my family contemplate contesting this will, I caution them not to do so. Four doctors examined me prior to the drawing of the will and their affidavits state that I am in excellent health, mentally stable, and my faculties are unimpaired. That is the end of her statement. - I was left the Park Avenue Apartment in the will she drew up last year. Not just a couple of paintings! - Jonathan's right. She did promise him the house. - Shane isn't even family. (shouting over each other) - Shut up, all of you, just shut up! She's only been dead for a few days and you're behaving like vultures. Don't any one of you dare to even think about contesting her will because I'll fight you. If it takes every penny we've got. I'll make sure her wishes are obeyed! (chattering) - No one's right going to get away with this. - Cheated. By those bloody women. - The audit has found nothing irregular in the books but that Jonathan wouldn't be stupid enough to steal from us blatantly. However, he is cheating Harte Enterprises. - [Paula] Then John Cross was right. - Yes, it seemed so. - Jonathan turned down several deals which were later picked up by Stonewall Properties. - And those would have been right for Harte? - Yes. Of course Jonathan could say that in his judgment they weren't right. - We have to catch him red-handed. - Set a trap for him? - With the bait, a property deal. - I know just the man. Malcolm Perring. Jonathan isn't your real worry, isn't he? - No. - You and Jim had so much when you started. What happened? - Me. I became Emma Harte in his eyes. - But Emma's a splendid person to be. - Not if you think she ruined your family. Not if you resent your wife becoming... - Poor Jim. So talented. And so blinkered. - As managing director and Editor-in-Chief you control the papers anyway. So why do you want shares? - For my children. - But they'll get Paula's shares. - Jonathan, either you want to sell or you don't. - You interest me, Jim. You were very angry when you only got five percent of the Canadian company. - You were even angrier when you felt you were being cheated by those bloody women. - All right. The shares will have to be valued by an accountant and then, - I want this deal kept private. - I can't sell without the board's approval. The family would have to know. Including Paula. - Forget it. - I can't sell this place. Blackie built it. My father grew up here. I was born here. - I bet I can steal beat you down the banisters. Don't you dare. - I win by default! (light music) - Oh, this always seemed so big to me. - I adored you even then. - I want to live here with you, Shane. Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever... - You haven't actually met Malcolm, have you Paula? - No. But we have spoken on the telephone. - Hello, Mrs. Fairley. - Hello. Are you getting anywhere with Jonathan? - I've had two meetings with him in the past 10 days. But he keeps putting me off, he won't make a decision. But the deal is perfect for Harte Enterprises and Jonathan knows it. - Sounded pretty good to me. - So why is he stalling? - Because he doesn't want to lose it and he wants to make sure it's exactly right for Stonewall Properties. - I'm positive that's it. He's checked on my company and on the property too. - Could you force his hand, play a bit desperate next time you meet him? Or would that seem unlikely? - No, I don't think so. I'll tell him I have to have immediate action. - You're putting pressure on me, Mr. Perring and I can't make a deal under those circumstances. - You've had two weeks. I'd hardly call that pressure. But I do need a decision today. I can't hold the property for you any longer. - Oh, are you saying you're pulling it? - Afraid so. I'll have to look for action elsewhere. - Ah, it's a pity really. (sighing) This would have been a good deal for Harte Enterprises. And I'm very grateful you thought of us. But you see I just can't handle it at this particular time. No, I have to pass. I'm sorry, old chap. - I'm sorry too. (knocking) - Mr. Perring, it's Mr. Cross. - Morning, Mr. Perring. - Morning. Your phone call intrigued me. So, what can I do to help you, Mr. Cross? - As I told you, I'm in property development and I'm always open to an interesting deal. - [Malcolm] Naturally. And do you have something you want to interest me in? - No, Mr. Perring, you have something I'm interested in. - I think there must be some mistake somewhere. We don't have anything special on our books at the moment. - Well there's that prime piece of property in Mayfair. The one you were negotiating with Harte Enterprises. - Not true. (chuckling) I wish it were. - I heard on the real estate grapevine that Harte Enterprises fell by the wayside. That the negotiations were broken off when they decided to pass. I know that property. I know you were looking for four million. I have that money available. What's the proposition, Mr. Perring? (laughing) - I'd look foolish if I continued to deny it, wouldn't I? - You're always looking for trouble insisting we've got difficulties when we haven't. You're the one who left the marital bed, not me. Because of you we've only got half a marriage. But I'm prepared to live with it. - We have no marriage at all. - We do have two children though and I'm prepared to share the same house as you for their sake. And talking of houses, I intend to move us all back to Longmeadow. It's my house, my home, and my children are going to be brought up there. - Jim, I want a divorce. - Well, I don't. And I'm never going to agree to one. And if you try and get a divorce, I shall fight you for custody of my children. They're gonna stay with me. - Children need their mother. - Well of course they do. Now why don't you stop all this nonsense and make an effort to patch up our marriage? I'm willing to try. - Jim, there's nothing left between us. Let's end it now. I've spoken to Henry Rossiter and there is no reason at all why we cannot have an amicable divorce. - There will be no divorce! (tense music) And I've been thinking about this new Canadian company. If you persist in this ridiculous idea of a divorce I'll settle in Canada. I'd enjoy running the Toronto Sentinel and naturally, I'd take my children with me. - Jim virtually threatened to take them out of the country? To Toronto if you don't do as he wishes? Isn't that so, darling? - More or less. - Yeah well Henry Rossiter says that by making children wards of court one prevents their removal to another country by a disgruntled parent. - Yes. I know what it means, daddy. I just don't think Jim would grab the twins. - I believe Jim would accept a settlement if it were hefty enough. - It's not money he wants, Daddy. Jim wants everything that the Fairleys ever had. Or more precisely, everything that he believes that Emma Harte took from the Fairleys. - Look, aside from myself, only two people knew about the Mayfair deal. You David, and Jonathan Ainsley. And when I started negotiations with Jonathan, I told him the deal was strictly confidential and must remain so. - Yes, but how do we know that he didn't tell anyone? - Well it would suit his purpose to keep it secret because he wanted to pass it on to Stonewall. - So when Sebastian said that he'd heard on the grapevine about the deal, you knew he was lying. - Exactly. - But that's not really enough to hang Jonathan, is it? - No, I'm afraid not. - But wait. When I told Sebastian that I didn't think Stonewall was big enough to handle the Mayfair deal, he began to boast about all the big deals he had pulled off. Finally, he gave me this list. I checked with those companies. And originally, every one of them were on the books at Harte Enterprises. - I recognize these names, Malcolm. I think we've got enough to challenge Jonathan. - Let me tell you something else I found out. Sarah Lowther is involved with Stonewall. - Sarah? - Now Jonathan. Anything new to report? - No, the property market's very quiet at the moment. - Even Stonewall? - Stonewall? (tense music) I don't believe I've heard of them. - But your partner, Sebastian Cross runs it. - What on earth are you babbling on about, Emily? - Stonewall is owned by you and Sebastian Cross. And Sarah has invested a great deal of money in it. - What's wrong with investing money in Stonewall? - Shut up, Sarah. - Cross owns it along with a number of straw men put in there by you, Jonathan. You've been channeling real estate deals intended for Harte Enterprises into your own company. You lost us an enormous amount of highly profitable business. - Just try to prove it. It's all here, Jonathan. All the evidence I need against you and Sarah. - You always hated us, David Amory. Just as you hate my father and poor Sarah's father. - Yes, poor Sarah indeed. - You've been duped. He's taken you for a ride, Sarah. - Jonathan? I don't understand. - Just shut up Sarah and let me do the talking. Oh you bastard Amory. You want it all, don't you? For Paula! You want our shares, our jobs. - You're fired. - Oh, you can't fire me. I'm a shareholder in this company and I have a right. - As managing director, I have extraordinary powers. I could do practically anything I want. I can hire and I can fire. And I am firing you. And you, Sarah. Your behavior's been just as shoddy as Jonathan's. - But I haven't done anything wrong, Uncle David. - You invested in a company that was in direct competition with Harte Enterprises. - You've been disloyal and treacherous, Sarah. - But I didn't know what Jonathan was doing. I just made an investment. - I'm gonna take this to my solicitor. What you're doing is not legal. And I'll get you for this, you bastard! - Get out! - And you too, you bitch. I'll get you for this, Paula Fairley! Sebastian and I will bloody get you1 (somber music) - Uncle David? What am I going to do? - I don't know, Sarah. I really don't know. - I'm against divorce, David. And I certainly don't want to lose my children. - That won't happen, Jim. You'll still be a member of this family. - I won't accept two million pounds. - Then how much do you want? - Money doesn't interest me. - Then what does? - The newspapers. - There are other shareholders as well as Paula and me. I'm not sure they'd go along. The newspapers are worth millions. - Yes, they were when the Fairleys owned them. - [David] I'd be prepared to transfer our shares, but-- - You could offer to buy the others out. - It's no guarantee they'd sell to me. - Emily and Winston would. Once they know Paula's happiness is involved. - I'm sure Sarah and Jonathan won't. - But the shares the four of you own will give me full control as majority shareholder. I'd like Henry Rossiter to draw up a letter of agreement between us, David. Once I've got that, I'll start divorce proceedings. - I wish you were coming to Camp Dontee, Paula. Easter won't be the same without you. - I'm sorry Emily. Scitex problems again. I just have to go to New York. (light music) - Hello. How are you? - Thank you both. (zooming) - The letter of agreement won't be ready till later this evening, Jim. - No problem. - Yes but if we wait for the documents from Henry Rossiter, we'll miss the flight to Nice. - Never mind, we'll go down tomorrow, Saturday. - My secretary can't get seats for either of those days. Easter Holidays, eh. Look here, why don't we sign the letter of agreement after the holidays, huh? - No, I'd prefer to have everything signed tonight as we agreed. - Very well. Perhaps we can get out on Sunday. - Oh I have a much better idea. I'll fly us both down in the new plane tomorrow. - All right. I'll let the family know when we're arriving. - [Woman] British Airways announced the arrival of their Concord Flight BA193 from London. - Hello. That father of yours is a miracle worker. - Yes he is, isn't he? Jim will have signed the agreement by now. (light music) And he'll file for divorce after Easter. - I want us to be married as soon as possible. - So do I. - We'll divide our time between London and New York. We'll keep this old place for weekends when we're here, yes? - Then it's Yorkshire. I want the children to grow up there. - Absolutely. And we're gonna travel together. Actually be in the same place at the same time. It'll mean juggling schedules. - Oh I'm very very good at juggling. - I do love you so. - And I love you. (sultry music) What a lovely way to be woken up. - And this is just the first morning of our whole life together. - You mean I'm going to be woken up like this every morning? - [Shane] Well. - Good. I should throw away my alarm clock. - Nope, nope, I can't guarantee I'll be this regular. - Yes you can. You're perfect. - True. - And so modest. (phone ringing) - Hello. Yeah, yes? Winston? How are you, old chap? Yeah. Right. Yes, thanks Winston. I'll call you back later. - Well it's the last time I ever ask you to make the coffee. (tense music) What's wrong? Please tell me what's happened, Shane. - That was Winston on the line. There's been some bad news. - Not my children. - No, no Lauren and Tessa are perfectly fine. - And what is it? - There's been an accident. A fatal accident. Your father. - No. No, not Daddy! - Jim's plane crashed in the mountains above Nice earlier today. Jim was killed too. - No. No! No! - Paula. - No! (sobbing) Not Jim! - Paula. - Not my father! No. No. (sighing) (clinking) - Darling. - I'm sorry. I can't bear to be touched by anyone. - You can't isolate yourself, Paula. - [Paula] I only wanted a divorce from Jim, I didn't want him to die. - Whatever you want, whatever you feel, it won't bring them back, darling. They're gone. We grieve for them, we remember them, but, life is for the living, Paula. - How do you go on? Without Daddy, how do you? - I've had 30 years of happiness. I'm lost now and dreadfully lonely. There's a big hole, a gap. I miss him. In every way. But I remember being happy and that comforts me a little. - Yes, but you deserve to be happy now. - So do you. - No, I killed them. - Paula! - They should have been safely in France with you. But because of me, because of what I wanted, they stayed behind. They should be alive now. - You were about to divorce Jim. You can't let his death come between us. - But he would have been alive if I hadn't. - There's no life for me without you. - One day perhaps you'll find someone else. - And you? - I have my work. - Work isn't enough. - Yes it is. It has to be. I owe it to Grandy and the family. - Holding her dream? - Yes. - And have you forgotten the last thing she said to you, Paula? She said to have a dream of your own. - It's a harsh world nowadays, Shane. No longer a place for dreams. - I can't stand this! I've got to go. I have nothing without you. I don't think I'll ever know peace of mind again. (somber music) (cars honking) - All she thinks about is work. Would you know, she hasn't cried once since it happened. - I think it's guilt, survivor guilt. Herringbone jacket, striped suit, plaid shirt. Guilt because she was with me at the time of the accident. How do you fight something like that, Emily? - I just wish she'd let her grief out like Daisy. (buzzing) That'd be Winston. - Oh it might be Skye. - Hello Skye. - Hello Emily. - [Emily] Hello darling. - In the elevator. Hello Shane. - Hello Skye. - It's all good, Shane. You're booked on my Concord flight tomorrow. - Great, thanks. - I couldn't believe it when you called and said you were moving back to England. - A sudden decision. Now, anyone like a drink? - No, we've got to get back to the apartment. - I booked a table for eight o'clock so we'll see you both later. It's all right, we'll see ourselves to the door. - [Skye] Bye. - [Emily] Bye, see you later. - [Shane] Bye. - What's happened? - I thought I couldn't bear to be near her. Truth is I can't bear not to be near her. - I'm going to miss you, Shane. You've been such a good friend to me these last months. - Well we've helped each other to limp along, haven't we? I'm very grateful to you, Skye. I'll be commuting every few weeks. I'll call you when I've come back. - Thank you. - Try not to worry. I'm sure everything's gonna work out with you and Ross. - But your divorce is final now. I thought we were gonna get married. - [Ross] Wishful thinking on your part. - And what about Jennifer? - [Ross] What about her? - She's your child, Ross. - Ah, but is she? I've never been too sure of that. - She's the spitting image of you! And there's the blood test. Anyway, you know I haven't looked at another man for the past four years! - Oh? You've been looking at one lately. Shane O'Neill. Since you're sleeping with him, I suggest you lead him to the altar. - I'm not having an affair with Shane! (laughing) All right. I did go to bed with him in London once but it didn't work between us. Shane's in love with someone else. He's not available. - Neither am I. - [Skye] Why? - Because I don't love you. You don't turn me on anymore. This is for you, for the child. You'll receive the same amount every month through my lawyer. - I don't want it! I can support our child. I don't need your money, it's only you I want. - That's too high a price for me. (sobbing) - Thank you, Ross. I should like you to go ahead and purchase these stocks. - It is a good investment. - [Paula] I'd appreciate your advice on another matter. If you've got a few minutes to spare. - Of course, how can I be of help? - With my Scitex shares. Should I sell them? - Well yes, but only to my client. - Naturally. But I do feel a little funny about selling to an anonymous buyer. - I promised my client complete confidentiality. I can't reveal the name. - Why not? I am expressing an interest in selling. (phone ringing) I'm sure it's not Getty. Or Standard Oil. - [Ross] No it's not. - Then it has to be one of the middle sized companies. Is it International Petroleum perhaps? - Not even close, Paula. - Come on Ross, you can tell me. I really am serious about unloading Scitex. - All right, It's Milt Jackson. - Of Ten Oil? - He already owns a large block of Scitex stock and with your 42%, it should give him-- - Real clout in the company. - You always have this urge to finish my sentences, don't you? - Hmm? Oh. - Well, will you sell to him? - I may. - Would you like me to arrange a meeting with Milt Jackson? - Yes I would. It is my duty to inform you Dale and my fellow board members that I intend to sell my Scitex stock. - How much of it? - Why, all of it, Marriot, the entire 40%. - No, just a minute. - And I intend to sell it immediately. - I'll buy it from you, honey. - Oh but I already have a buyer, Marriot. - Who? I think we should know who the buyer is. - Milt Jackson of Ten Oil. - You can't sell to him! I'll match his offer. I'll better it, honey. - I'm not trying to raise the price of my stock. I want to sell to Milt. He'll be good for this company. New blood. - He already owns shares in Scitex. If you sell to him, you'll be virtually giving him control of the company. - That's right. - Yes I'm aware of that, Dale. - Your grandfather Paul McGill founded this company with my uncle. And now you wanna give it to a pirate like Jackson? Well I won't let you. - You can't force me to do anything, Marriot. However gentlemen, perhaps I could offer you an alternative to Milt Jackson. - What alternative? - Me. I won't sell my stock. I'll hold on to it if certain conditions of mine are met. - And what are they? - I have three. You must guarantee me a stronger voice on the Scitex board. I insist that the North Sea Operation continues and Dale's contract must be renewed immediately. - This is blackmail! - Goddamit, she did blackmail the board, Dale. - I wouldn't say that, Ross. That's life, business. - If this gets out, I'm gonna look like the biggest idiot on Wall Street. Imagine a shrewd hard-ass banker being taken by a slip of a girl, Jesus Christ. - It's not gonna get out, Ross. Now calm down. - I'll tell Milt Jackson she reneged. I hope he buys it. I can't afford to lose him as a client or Ten Oil as a corporate account. - I'll back you all the way. Now just remember, you can't be held responsible for a woman changing her mind. (chuckling) - I'm expecting her a little later this afternoon. - [Dale] Okay Ross, bye bye. - Yeah thanks Dale. (tense music) (knocking) - [Secretary] Come in. Hello, Mrs. Fairley. - Hello Val. - [Val] I'll tell Mr. Nelson you're here. - [Ross] Yes, Val? - Miss Fairley's arrived, Mr. Nelson. - Yeah, send her in please. - [Val] Yes. Will there be anything else? - No that's all. Thanks, good night. - [Val] Good night, see you tomorrow. - Paula. - Hello, Ross. - [Ross] Over here. - Sorry to be late. I got held up at the fifth avenue store. - Oh don't worry about it. - You wanted to talk to me about some investments of mine. Is there a problem? - No, no, no, no. I just thought we should have a drink. - I haven't planned to stay very long. I have masses of work I have to clear up tonight. - Well I'm sure you have time for one drink. - All right. I'll have a Perrier. Thank you. - You certainly shoved it to the Scitex board. Here's to you. Congratulations. - I suppose you're mad because I'm not selling my stock to Milt Jackson? - Well, it's your prerogative. Milt Jackson's not going anywhere. He'll always buy you out. - Yes I'm sure he will. But you must remember I never said I would sell to Milt Jackson. (laughing) And I do appreciate your advice in this matter. - That's what I'm here for. - Let's get on with our business Ross. I'm pressed for time. - Oh in a minute. I was hoping you'd have dinner with me. - I'm sorry Ross, I really do have to go. (tense music) Get off, Ross, what are you doing? - Dammit you, work with me. This is actually done. (grunting) - [Paula] Stop it! (crashing) (bashing) No, stop! (bashing) (groaning) (retching) (splashing) (sobbing) - Paula? Is something wrong? - Sorry, I've been crying. - There's nothing wrong with crying. You've bottled it up for far too long. I think deep down you felt it was your fault. But Jim and your father's death had nothing to do with you, it was an accident. - I know. - Oh my god. What happened? - Ross Nelson tried to rape me this evening. - What?! This is dreadful! I'll call a doctor or the police! - No, no, no, no, Emily. Come here. It was disgusting but somehow the awful violence made, oh you're right. I've got to forget about the past. I can't explain it. - I can. You must learn to stop punishing yourself. - That's what Shane said to me. - [Emily] He was right. He loves you. (light music) (hooves clopping) - I thought you were in New York. - Oh, I came back yesterday. - I see. What have you done to your face? - I fell. It's nothing. - What are you doing out here? - I came looking for you. - Yes? - Would you give me the ring Blackie gave to Emma? - Emma really should have left it to you. - No. No, she meant it for you. I'm not asking you for the ring simply as a gift but as your future wife. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Shane.
