WOMAN 2: Next in line, please. I just have a straight-- Uh-uh, Darnell. Darnell, don't do this. -Now, come on, Darnell. Stop playing. DARNELL: What? What playing? It's not a fucking game.

I've just known Darnell from around the way, is all. We live in the same projects. STRODE: Frankie, will you do me a favor? Just tell me one thing, and we'll get out of here. Sure. STRODE: What's the procedure when you're being robbed? Look, sir. FRANKlE: l'm aware that l did. I'm aware-- -Stop, stop. Stop now! What's the procedure when you're being robbed? You pull the money clip... ...from your right-hand drawer. -And then you signal with the left-- -You signal with the left. So you know the procedure? Yes, like I said, the procedure has been told to me over a million times. But why is it if that procedure's been told to you... ...why didn't you follow the procedure? Because he had a gun. And l went for my clip, but he shot her. He shot her right in front of me. I'm afraid, Miss Sutton, we're gonna have to let you go. The fact you knew the perpetrator doesn't sit well with us. Wait, wait. That's not right. I haven't done anything wrong. I can't help who I know. Mr. Zachery... ...just last week you gave me a promotion, and now you're gonna take my job away? What happens the next time one of your friends robs the bank? How do we know you're not in collusion? Collusion? Let me tell you something. I am here at 8:20 sharp every morning. I work my ass off until quitting time. Yesterday I counted $240,000 by hand for you. That's how you should know. I mean, come on, this is just not right. I nearly got blown away in your tired-ass fucking bank! And you're gonna fire me? ZACHERY: Calm down. -You couldn't even wait. You didn't even bother to ask me if l was thirsty, sister. STRODE: She's involved. I want everything you have on her. [LAUGHlNG] I thought I said a '70s graduation party. '70s, Halloween, what's the difference?

STONY: Yeah, college boy. -You got to stop spoiling that boy. Taking care of him ever since your mama and daddy died. [SIGHS] -What you got? -You ain't drinking none of this shit. Stevie, what's the problem? I'm not going. I ain't going to college. What? All right, look, don't start tripping. Okay, you cannot change your mind. We got into UCLA, that's where we're going. I ain't changed my mind. I just didn't get a scholarship. -They didn't give you a scholarship? -No. -We told them, only way we could apply-- -l know. [SCOFFS] All right, well don't worry about it.

I'll just get a job. -l'll just help around here until I can just-- -No. Wrong, we gonna stick to the plan... ...and we are definitely getting you up out of here. -l ain't here with this fool. -Good afternoon, ladies... ...and gentleman.

You got to recycle. Who had 1 04? I did. You didn't empty the cans in 1 04. I'm docking your pay. -That ain't right. LUTHER: Who are you supposed to be? Goddamn Mighty Morphing fucking Power Ranger? What you gonna do? I'm docking her pay. Speaking of pay... ...l thought you said that you was gonna pay me under the table. They're taking taxes out of my check. I ain't got enough money... -...to pay for my babysitter. -On this good earth... ...there are three peoples I don't mess with. The I, the R, and the S. But l got my babysitter. Look, if you don't like working for Luther's Janitorial... ...why don't you just take your broke ass home? Otherwise, shut the fuck up and get back to work. Hey. You know, you're one cold-hearted motherfucker, Luther. -Get back to work. -You ain't have to talk to her like that. Get back to work. STONY: Tisean, you have got to learn to stand up for yourself.

Twenty G's, damn. See, that's what the fuck we need to do. Rob a bank. -No, that's crazy. CLEO: Now really, though. The four of us could take a bank. [LAUGHlNG] Look, if that crackhead, Darnell could rob a bank, we could take the bank. Twenty G's would save my life right now. Stevie needs tuition. Well, too bad we ain't some hard-up crackhead motherfuckers... ...like Lorenz and them. Then, sure, we could do some suicidal shit like rob a bank. But we ain't crazy, so we can't. FRANKlE: So now you making the rules? -Frankie, please. Please, ain't nobody over here gonna be robbing no bank. FRANKlE: You're right. We ain't gonna rob no bank. Mm-mm. Let's just go in there and blow it the fuck up. [LAUGHlNG] Here you go. Can you believe after working for that damn bank for two years... ...l can't even get a recommendation for another job?

You know what l mean? And what would that be? Oh, come on, now, you know. [CHUCKLES] Let's go for a ride, huh? [ANDREWS GROANlNG] Mm, mm. So when do I get my advance? Oh, l don't know. Tomorrow, maybe the day after. Look, Nate, before l do this, I want my check. Hey, whoa, whoa, look. You're not getting no check from me until I'm done, you understand? This ain't right.

Frankie, relax. -How can you stand the smell of garbage? -Girl, shit ain't that bad. It ain't that bad? -Cleo, that's because you live in a garage. -Girl, it'll be okay. And you, stay out of it. Damn, look at my nails. Girl, you been bitching all night. Stony back there acting all stink-a-dink-dink. [FRANKlE & CLEO & TlSEAN LAUGHING] That's all right, I got something for that head.

Before they started laying people off... ...they was paying folks $1 5 dollars an hour at that place. TISEAN: Oh, man, that's good money. Nigga, for $1 5 dollars an hour, I'd be all: "Full-ply radial. What I gotta do, sir?" Ass motherfucker. -They'd have to pull me off that machine. FRANKlE: Shit, l know that's right. CLEO: Overtime would be like 22.50 an hour. I don't know what l'm gonna do. Now that Luther's taking taxes out of my check... ...l'm making half as much as l used to.

You're gonna have to prove you can take care of him. But kids get into poison every day. WELLS: Not in the workplace. To us that spells neglect.

I say, "Don't give me bank money. If you come out with that clip, my gun is going in your mouth." That's what l'm talking about. -Let's go through plan B. CLEO: Plan B? The fuck this planning shit. Why can't we just get buck with these motherfuckers... ...go in there and take the money? Why can't you just listen for once? -Plan B, Frankie. FRANKlE: All right, plan B. Stony, when Cleo goes to the teller, you start to survey the line for the cow. Cow? There's gonna be a cow up in there? Stop smoking weed. Cleo, the cow is just a small vault on wheels.

You must be used to those roughneck types. ls that what it is? So where we gonna eat? I don't know. l was thinking maybe you could show me someplace in your hood. -ln my hood? -Your hood, yes. -You ain't trying to flow like that. -l might be trying to. You're probably from Harvard and all. As a matter of fact, I am. I still gotta eat. And l'm still very hungry so could we please feed a man. Give him some nourishment or some sustenance. That's all l'm asking... ...Miss You-Need-To-Starve Because-You're-From-Harvard. KElTH: This is really a nice restaurant. It's black-owned, l like that. Do you come here often? No, I've never been, I just heard about it. -So where are you from? -D.C. -Have you ever been? -Nope. KElTH: Mm. No, but that's where the mayor got popped basing up, isn't it? [CHUCKLES] Yeah, well, nobody's perfect, right? It's a great town, though. I miss it. I really, really miss it. Anyway, I came directly from New York. -Have you ever been to New York? -No. KElTH: Ever been outside Los Angeles? -No. When I was in New York, I was working on Wall Street and before that B school. STONY: B school? -Business school, l'm sorry. -l wanted to go to business school. -Really? What, financing, uh, marketing? No, typing and bookkeeping. [CHUCKLES] Oh, l'm sorry. Is that not professional enough? It's hard for me to believe that you're this hard when you're so beautiful. And so tough. I'm not tough. l just don't think we have anything in common. Stony, l don't want anything from you. I really don't. I have no expectations, no demands. I am quite content... ...just listening to you. Sitting here. Staring into those beautiful, pretty brown eyes. Are you cross-eyed? -No, your head is just small. Ha, ha. KElTH: Ha, ha. My head is small. Makes my eyes go this way: Because I have to focus in on your little peanut. No, I'm just kidding. KElTH: Oh, my peanut. [KElTH & STONY LAUGHING] KElTH: This is it. It's not much but, it's home. I took the lease over from my brother who brought me to L.A. STONY: Do you feel free? KElTH: Hell, yeah, l feel free. STONY: Hmm. Hmm. Well, l don't feel free. I feel very much caged. Caged. Hmm. -What are you doing about it? -What do you mean? This cage, what are you doing to get out? What are your plans? l mean, where do you see yourself, say, in five years, Stony? I don't know. See that's.... That's what l'm saying. We don't plan for the future, as a people. We never-- Have you ever thought about it? I mean, really put serious thought where you see yourself in the future? Well, l worked really hard to keep a roof over me and my brother's head. To keep clothes on our back. [SIGHS] -And I planned on sending him to college. -That's great. Then he should go to college. He'll go on and accomplish things... ...and he'll be great and wonderful, like his sister. He's dead. Oh, l'm sorry, l didn't realize. -lt's okay. -No, it's not. No. I'm dealing with it. You are, aren't you? Tough lady. -ls that a Cabernet or Merlot? -Damn. MAN 1 : Take care of it. MAN 2: All right, I'll follow it up. -The next time he has a problem-- -Captain Fredricks, sir? Do remember the bank robbery where four people were killed... ...and the arrest of the perp where a young man was killed? We're still getting bad press for that. Sir, l'd like to bring in his sister. I think she's one of the robbers. -What you got? -l've got a girl named Francesca Sutton. She's a teller at the Pan Pacific Bank. I'm certain she was connected to the thing. -Go on, go on. -Francesca and Lida are best friends. Right, that's a big coincident, okay? -There's also physical likeness-- -Wait, do you remem-- -They're real suspects. -Do you remember the headline? -"lnnocent student killed by cop." -l remember. You bring in his sister based on the fact that she knows someone... -...who may be friends with a robber? -Right. What the hell's wrong with you, Strode? No way. Can l get a tail on her, sir? What part of "no" don't you understand, Strode? The N or the 0? [CHUCKLES] Up. We go-- Oh, shit. Now watch it. Watch it. Aah! Fuck them niggas now. [LAUGHlNG] Watch it. Watch it, honey. Here it come now. CLEO: Oh, now. Oh, shit, girl. What is you doing? Cleo, how come you ain't been to work in a week? Because look what l got here. I bought my baby some new things. Check them out. Luther said you fired. STONY: Cleo. Cleo. We gotta act like nothing's different. Now, you need to get to Luther's and get your job back. -Man, Luther can kiss my ashy kneecap. -Money got you tripping. I know you out of money by now, Cleo. Now what you gonna do? Rob another goddamn bank. What the fuck is y'all thinking? Hold on, we said once, Cleo. To get us change to get us up out of here. And that's all it is, Stony. We need some real money. I don't know how far out of town you plan to get, baby sister. But you ain't getting far on 3 grand. Oh, really? All right, Louise, you take Thelma over there and y'all go rob another bank if you all that. CLEO: Fuck you. I know you ain't fitting to back down on us now that we need you. I want some more motherfucking money. Cleo, you are real high... ...and you acting real stupid. You need to get that gun off my face. -Oh, shit. -Don't you ever raise a gun to me again. CLEO: Or what? Or what? What? What? Are you gonna hit me, motherfucker? Stony, we go back to first grade. -You've been my peeps for 20 years. -Cleo, come on. Get off of me. You know what? I ain't fucking with you no more. STONY: Yeah, well, fuck you too. Fuck you, fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck her! [HUMMlNG] [LATlN MUSlC PLAYlNG ON STEREO] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Come on in. How you doing? -l'm all right. -You sure? All right, now, I hope you like Mexican foods. We have fajitas, enchiladas, special sauce. You have a seat right there. Now, you say you don't travel a lot. This is what we're gonna do, Stony. From here on out. I cook, we eat, you pick the country, starting with Mexico. And now sit back, relax, load off your feet. Smell the aroma of Mexico and the sounds. What? I just got a lot on my mind. You wanna talk about it? No. Okay. What do you think about friends and money? [CHUCKLES] I think they don't mix, why? I just had a very big argument with one of my best friends... ...about a money situation. And l don't think we're gonna be friends anymore. Don't you lose that friend over money. It's not worth it. Money you can replace easy. Friends, real friends, you can't. Don't sweat it. You have the answer to everything, don't you? No, I wouldn't say that. I'm just sharing my experience with you. Who do you think you are? I'll be your genie if you let me. Your every wish is my command. Cleo, you know you was wrong for what you did to Stony. Fuck her. Fuck Stony. -We'll do this without her. -Now, wait a minute. Now, suppose Stony put a gun in your face, what would you do? I would've slapped you too. Oh, come on now, you know I wasn't gonna shoot her. You know how l get when l'm faded. You still was wrong. So T.T., what's my girl gonna do? Girl, you gotta step to that judge and prove you got some coins in the bank. I ain't doing nothing without Stony. Stony! -l don't wanna give that ho no ride. -Stop acting like a baby. STRODE: Bingo. Come to me, baby. Oh, yeah, grand theft auto. I love to see it. -Hey, Waller? -Yeah. Tell me something. -Yeah. -Did l or did l not say... ...all these women run together? WALLER: Hmm. Do you feel me? I thought that you would. Work with me, baby. Look, l'm sorry. You're sorry. Let's just put it all behind us. Come on. We've been through worse. Apology accepted. But you know you need to come back in with us. You ain't got enough money to get out of town. You're right about that. But l want more than that. I mean, is this the only way? See, l wanna be somebody who doesn't have to do this crap. You know what l'm saying? [CHUCKLES] Stony, you can go to suburbia and start a new life. But we ain't nothing but hood rats. Now, l can live with that, you can't. The hood is where l belong. I mean, what am l gonna do in Hollywood? Or Thousand Oaks or some shit? [LAUGHlNG] Man, shit. Why we gotta roll over and accept that though? We gotta have a plan. What does our future look like? Where do you see yourself five years from now? I don't know. And l don't care. But l ain't thinking about five years from now. I'm just trying to get through the day. LUTHER: What the hell? Cleo, I know you didn't come to work... ...ain't been to work and don't call nobody. I'm broke, Luther. I know you gonna give me my job back... ...because nobody take shit the way l take shit. Now, shut up before I stick that mop up your ass, Luther. You better save that for your little girlfriend. Well, get to work... ...ladies and gentleman. [ITALIAN ACCENT] There's been a rift in this family... ...and that is not good for business. See, we wanna play it like it was. Back to work, see? If only Tisean and Stony will come rob the bank with us. We started as a gang of four. We must always be four. Don Stony from the Bronx. What is your opinion? Should we rob the bank? [ITALIAN ACCENT] The only way I can return to this family... ...if we do this one more time... ...we do it right. [LAUGHlNG] We get enough money to get us up out of here for good. T.T., you agree? Cleomenza. No more funny looking underwear for your little girlfriend. [ITALIAN ACCENT] Cleomenza, no more... ...fancy cars. Shopping sprees. Cleomenza. Can you respect our conditions? Can you live with the terms that your dons have set forth? [ITALIAN ACCENT] Yes, Godfather. Tisean Scullino from Detroit, are you cool with all of this? I am. And you... ...Don Stony from the Bronx. Can you accept your godfather's terms? All right then. We're back in effect. Next stop, Balboa Savings and Loan. CLEO: Whoa, right down there. Okay. Yeah. TISEAN: Think you can do that? FRANKlE: Hurry up. [CLEO GRUNTS] [CLEO GRUNTlNG] STONY: You got it?

FRANKlE: Hands up and move back away from the drawer. That's right. You, move back. Get down! Open the drawer and you fill it up. Let's go. -Did you hear what l said?

You think of anything else, you give us a call today. -This the girls? -Took off in the Suburban. Apparently the getaway car was blocked. It's still out there. Car theft report's from near the 21 st Street garage. They're getting in way over their heads, aren't they? They don't fucking know it. Man, counting money is harder than working for Luther. I'm getting dizzy up here. Two hundred and ninety-six thousand, Stony, and counting. Whoo! -So, what's that? -Seventy five thousand a piece. Whoo! Seventy-five thousand dollars a piece. That's a lot of money. I'm rich! Aah! Ooh, look at all of this, okay. Look, this is what we do. We're gonna keep scrubbing floors... ...like we been doing, nothing's changed. We're get Jajuan.

Cleo, how come we putting all the money here instead of at home? If the police track us that's the first place they gonna look. -Oh. Okay. -All right? All right. [DRILL WHlRRING] Stony, l'm substituting for my boss tonight at a cocktail party... ...for the National Association of Bankers at the Biltmore. And I'd like you to accompany me. -Aah! Damn it. -Hey. That would be really nice. Great. Well, listen, be here early. Don't know what time the limo's coming since you won't let me pick you up. Limo? Yeah, black tie, limo, 6:00. I'll see you then.

OFFlCER: You know, sir, a blue Lexus was stolen from the garage this afternoon... ...from the space next to yours. We wondered if you saw or heard it. KElTH: No, no, I just got home myself. -Okay, thanks. Sorry to bother you. KElTH: Not a problem, not a problem. Are you okay? I just don't like cops after what happened with my brother, that's all. All right, well, listen, car will be right here, make yourself at home. So you like? It's real nice. You got a bar, you got crystal. Stony, we've been spending time together lately. It's been nice. We've been real straight forward with one another and honest. But l have lied about one thing. What have you lied about? Let's take a little detour. Alex, do me a favor. Change of plans. Take a right at the next light. And l'll tell you from there. WOMAN: lt's good to see you. MAN: Fantastic. How are you? Shall we go? Hello.

I have taught Keith everything he knows about banking. -Nigel, Patrice, l'd like you to meet my-- -Lady. -Lady. Stony. -Hi, I'm Patrice. -Nigel, nice to meet you. KElTH: Stony. There are some heavy hitters here. -Michigawa from Sanwa. -l saw Strolman from Citibank over there. Check this, if a terrorist were to come and blow this place... ...the banking systems of Japan, Europe and the United States would never recover. -Right. -l thought a roomful of dead bankers... ...meant that, uh, the world would be a better place. Ha, ha. -Yeah. My wife. -Yeah. So, uh, Stony, are you in banking also? -No. -Yes, in a way. Wells Fargo, B of A, Chemical? Well, l prefer to create my own personalized portfolio... ...which reflect an original diverse taste in funding sources. Well. KElTH: Always got me into trouble, always raiding the sororities. Yeah, he hadn't grown up but we're working on him. STONY: Right. He seems like a nice guy. No, he's terrible. -l hate him. -Ha, ha. He's a good guy. I want you to know... ...that this is one of the best nights of my life. I've never felt so special. Do you feel free now? Well, for now, but it's not my life. I'm just borrowing from pieces of yours. Borrowing's not such a bad thing. As long as you return the favor. Look at all your friends. They all own banks. Where l'm from, you're lucky to have a bank account. [BLOWS] I just wanna get out of here. Have you ever felt like that? Like you just wanted to get up and go and move forward and you can't? Baby, you don't have to go anywhere. Stay with me. For a little while. And then you decide if you wanna stick around. You think about it. Okay? Your fine self. [BOTH MOANING] [BOTH LAUGHING] You crazy. Hi, l'm, uh, Pete Rodney. I'm taking over for Luther. Where's Luther? He ain't cleaning this building no more. He got out of the business.

[WHlSTLES] Man, l ain't do shit. -You ain't got probable cause. -All you're doing is a lineup. And for the record, having a witness is a lot better than probable cause. Get in the car. Today. Take this home, call the girls. ALlSSA: You sure they can't see me? WALLER: No, no. Just your imagination. -lt looks like everyone looking right at me. -Do you see her? Hmm? -The person that killed Luther Morris? -Take your time and concentrate. Hmm? Face right. You see her? The person that killed Luther Morris. No, it's not her. Be sure now. You see her.

Look, they gonna be after all of us. We gonna take that bank downtown. Are you in? No, I ain't in. Hell no. You ain't got no fucking choice.

How the fuck is my drinking coffee making you nervous? TISEAN: l don't know, it just is. -Okay, okay, listen up. Nobody has ever successfully robbed this bank. I wish you would stop saying that. I'm saying that because the nearest freeway is a mile away. We gotta stick to the plan. All right? -l know y'all sick of wearing them wigs. -What you got? Okay? l got some other stuff in the car.

WALLER: There has been a rash of these robberies in the Los Angeles area... ...as far east as Pasadena, as far north as the San Fernando Valley. They seem to know the inner workings of each bank. Wigs and sunglasses aid them in their disguise. Their M.O. is in and out. Please do not be mislead by the fact that these four bandits are females. It's not gonna be, "Stick them up and give me your dough." Your lives are going to be in jeopardy, and that's a fact. These girls are the real deal. They've gotten good at casing out the banks that they knock off. -Yes, Keith Weston, please. -What the fuck are you doing? STRODE: They seem to know the intricacies of bank security systems. More importantly, they know how to get around them. They may even have a contact to the inside, so please be aware. WALLER: Obviously, they don't appear this way when they're on the street. -We have photographs-- KElTH: This is Keith. Keith, listen to me.
