Based on the true story of Fausto Cattaneo, a Swiss police officer specialising in the fight against drugs He was one of the most f?ted infiltration officers of his day Loosely based on the book "How I Infiltrated the Drug Cartels" Goodbye, daughter. I love you. - Hands up. You're under arrest. - Help. I surrender. Go ahead and search me. Search all you like. I'm innocent, I swear. What this? It's a mother goddess statuette. From 6,000 BC. In Anatolia it was a symbol of fertility, believed to make crops abundant. Is it for Mummy who's in heaven? Her love will protect you now. Emmeline knows you played truant this morning. You've always seen straight through me, Hans. Elsa's a lucky girl. But that's not the real present. Careful. What is it? What is it? A phone. Hello. - Hello, my little princess. - Hi. Hans, we can start. Mother will join us later. So you've been consigned to the archives? My word. You are on form. I had dinner last night with the prosecutor, Mrs Ferrucci. Mrs Ferrucci? She's a surprising woman. She might well agree to join our board of directors. Ferrucci? Make no mistake. She has no friends. You're the one who has no friends, Marc. Only informers. Anyway, you don't know her. She only mixes in the best circles. - Losers like you, you mean? - What's a loser? It's a bit like a fox who has lost its tail. Very clever. Your service record is hardly glowing, though, is it? And what makes you glow? Licking Ferrucci's arse? You poor sod. Refine your language. This is not a police station. Don't follow their example. A respectable young girl must rise above this filth. I was expecting you last Friday for our card game. - Work. - Of course. You still manage to see your daughter. Coffee, Hans. Yes, madam. Your phone is very pretty, darling. - Alexandre. - Yes, Mother? The State Councillor came to see me. He's not happy at all. Avoid these mistakes in future and nurture the relationship. We stand to lose money through his brother-in-law. You see, Marc? Your brother has no sense of priority. - Marc, I need to talk to you... - I'd love to, but another time. I must go. You do forgive me, don't you? - Can I have a kiss? - I forgive you. But remember you have a family. Only one. Don't forget to phone me. - Eh? - Daddy. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, darling. Thank you, pet. Thank you. I love you. What would I do without you? Department of Justice and Police Archives I've been expecting you in my office for a week now. Don't tell me you've brought me some filing to do. What really brings you into the bowels of the earth? Wenger. Simon Wenger. Swiss citizen. Vast private wealth. Based in Gstaad, lives in Paris. Tons of brass. Far too much money for an honest man. There's nothing special about people with vast wealth. What happened to all your talk of powerful drug traffickers corrupting our young people and laundering money mountains? That's enough of your sarcasm, Girard. I've had my eye on him for three years. He's a big fish. And I need you to nail him. Track down Wenger. Eat in his favourite restaurant. Go to the same tailor as him. Fuck his tarts if you have to. But I want him. You will accept this mission because you're sick and tired of festering in here. And because you can't do anything else, Girard. I'm sorry. Girard can't accept this mission. Superintendent Cambas. Seems the archives are the place to be for a bit of federal chitchat. Don't be so two-faced, Marc. I'm not pleased to see you, either. I've got some good guys ready in situ. The consideration you show Girard is to your credit, my dear Cambas. If I accept I want a free hand. It's out of the question for you to accept this mission. What is it, Cambas? When will you stop crapping yourself every time you deal with me? Have you already forgotten Keller's death? You're lucky Ferrucci buried you in the archives. That's right. I'm being used as a scapegoat to save your arse and the department's. But who is responsible? Who sent the kid to be slaughtered? Stop it. Why did you give the signal? We all nearly went down. That's enough. Keller died while carrying out his duties. The case is closed. Superintendent, I want you to put Girard onto Wenger. And as for you, I want you to accept. And this time I'm leading the investigation. I will decide in situ whether it is necessary to grant you a free hand or not. OK. OK, I agree, but I want to see a full psychological report on him. And I'd like one of my men to back him up. Who is this novice you want to put under my feet? Maroni. Enzo Maroni. He's an excellent cop. What do you say? I need time to think. And if I go, I want Anita to come with me. I'm counting on you for that report. You keep missing your sessions. You'll never recover at this rate. It's because I am better. I've come to warn you that they want a report from you. Have you been given a new mission? You're not ready. Have you seen the financial pages today? The mayor is accusing the banks of money laundering and Prosecutor Ferrucci of dragging her heels. You'll end up up shit creek without a paddle, as usual. Turn down this mission. It's too soon. Agree to be my partner. My brains. You can babysit me. You can help me see things more clearly. Why not carry on with Anita? Anita is a good sidekick but she's not a good guide. I need someone I have confidence in to back me up. I need you to write a full psychological report on me. A favourable one. To convince Cambas. Operations Bureau - Geneva Nice pad. You've come up in the world, Cambas. Hi, Marc. We were expecting you. I'm sure you know Officer Lisa M?ller. I've decided she should join us on the Wenger case. She's written me a thorough report on your psychological state. She knows exactly how you operate. What about my strategy? I'll adapt. I'll train her. She can stay here at the base. She can keep a log for you. Anita Ledoux is already in situ in Paris with Enzo Maroni. The Parisians will tap the phones You can send them a copy. Here. This came for you. Giancarlo Perrotti, a financial consultant from Buenos Aries who has come to the rescue of his Italian cousin, Paolo Perrotti. Does my cover story hold together? Is this Paolo collaborating of his free will? - Or to get his sentence reduced? - It's up to the Italians. At any rate, Paolo has named Giancarlo as his right-hand man. And Vastel has confirmed that he's part of the family. So your offices are your cousin's in Milan. Officer M?ller, your role is a very important one for the infiltration to be a success. I hope you will be adaptable enough. I can adapt, Girard. Spare me Mr Perrotti's sexist remarks. Let's just enjoy working together. He's our man. Who's that guy with him? No idea. Shit. There's too much reflection. Let's go. No, stay here. They've spotted him. Darling! Don't sulk. We'll miss the bateau-mouche. Do you have to cause a scene? - Come on. - Stop it. No, we're going. Now kiss him. Don't ever stick your revolting tongue into my mouth again. Forget it. Wenger's a pro regarding cops. Don't do anything that stupid again, Maroni. - What is it? - Lift maintenance. It will be out of order for half an hour. Really? Nice bachelor pad, Mr Wenger. Business must be booming. Can you hear me? Hello. - Loud and clear, Marc. - I don't like your man. He's not meant to be searching Wenger's flat. I've never seen an infiltrator do that. If he gets caught, he'll fuck up the case. I refuse to end up dishing out parking fines. You'd like it. You're a stickler for rules. Well, I'm not an ex-hacker. Cool it, Maroni. Marc knows what's he's doing. Good. Just like when Keller got killed. Do you know what I think? You should have stayed in the office to lick Cambas' arse. I've found a computer and I have the access code. Install the spay access on your USB key. And don't forget to plug in the switch on the internet cable. Right, Wenger, how do you launder your money? Do you go through a bank or a business lawyer? Simon, are you there? It's Helena. Are you still mad at me? You know me. I couldn't help myself. Next time, if you like, I'll let you join in. I'll see you at Sherwood. Who are you? Well, well. Nice one, Wenger. Anita, I think I've laid hands on a financial arrangement. Shit. Here's Wenger. - Wenger? - He's just gone in. - Are you sure? - I swear, it was him. - Marc, Wenger's coming. - Shit. Yes? Helena. I've just this minute got back. No, that's impossible. All right. Stay there. I'm on my way. Shit. What? The number? Yes, "Daddy" is "Dad". I put "Dad"... You just have to... Yes, my love. If you press "Dad", it will call me. It's Hans who... Yes. Yes, you have to... Wait, I need to... I miss you, too, my love. Raw silk. How much did that set you back? Hands off. Who's this? Helena Brancusi, one of world's best paid models. But her lust for sex and coke have been the ruin of her. She's even made a few blue movies. Her shop on the Faubourg Saint-Honor? is on the brink of collapse. They're meeting tonight. - And you're going. - I'm not. But Giancarlo Perrotti is. Magnificent and broad-minded. Do you like it? Isn't this a bit square? Italian style, darling. - There. - We don't have authorisation. Who are you working for, Enzo? Follow my instructions. Put your suit on and no more questions. What are you scared of, Enzo? Aren't you up to the job? I'm off. I can scarcely believe my eyes. Let me buy you a drink. Yes, later. A bottle, then. - Ah. Here. - Cheers. Let's clink. Now take me with you. - Thanks. - Pleasure. Let's dance. - You're lucky you met me. - You're very kind. - Get off. - Very good. - Let's kiss. - No, get off. Get lost. Get lost, you arsehole. Have you seen yourself? Stop bothering the young lady. Thanks. That was great. I thought chivalry was a thing of the past. - Let me buy you a drink. - No, no. Come on. I'll introduce you to my friends. Forgive me. Someone's expecting me. But I'm leaving you in good company. How was I? - Did you see me? - You nearly broke his nose. No, I didn't. I hit him here. Look what I've got. Isn't this nice? Helena Brancusi. - Did you nick it? - I just borrowed it. It's a pretty bracelet, isn't it? Did you see that, Lisa? Ready? It's too dangerous, Helena. Klein says we should wait. - The clients won't wait. - Klein doesn't want to go. If he says the timing's wrong, he must have his reasons. You know I'm in deep shit. Please don't go. Just leave it. Stop making a scene. You're just chickening out. I'm going and you can't stop me. If you're in such a rush, I'll give you your share now, OK? You're out, Helena. Do you hear? What if Klein refuses? You can find someone else. Klein must be one of Helena's old flames. He's in Switzerland and only deals with Wenger. He's buying time. Why? What's he afraid of? What does he know that we don't? We just haven't worked it out yet. That's true. What does Wenger risk if he doesn't do it? Losing his client and getting shot. What will Klein do if Wenger finds a replacement for him? He's likely to take it very badly. He won't let it go that easily. You can hear the fear in Wenger's voice. His clients must be bloody dangerous. You're not saying anything, Marc. Right, we've checked out merchant bankers, stockbrokers and trustees, but there are no Kleins. Who'd want to use a pseudonym? Perrotti's office. What can I do for you? Just a moment. I've got to go, Lisa. I've got Wenger on the other line. Hello. Yes. Mr Wenger. How are you? Helena told me about the bracelet. Congratulations to the staff at your hotel and laundry. Honesty is so rare these days. They found it in my jacket pocket. I hadn't even noticed. I wonder how it got there. Thank him for the shares. And thank you again for your tip about share prices. Tell me, where do you get your information from? I trust... you made a tidy profit, Mr Wenger. Absolutely, but... It's still strange that my friends have never heard of you. My clients really appreciate my discretion. Until he fell ill, it was my cousin who handled affairs in Europe. We'd like to have dinner with you tonight. Are you free? Tonight? I'd love to. I'll postpone my appointment. Thank you. Not so stupid after all. There. Let me handle this. I am Italian. I am Giancarlo Perrotti. I am a financial consultant. My cousin is sick. Cancer. Of the lungs. Some transactions produce then best results when they happen just like that. The most complex operations are sometimes the simplest. And the lower the price, the better. I hear you. With the different regulations, it's not always easy. I imagine you have friends in high places. Let's just say I find alternative routes. The Channel Islands, for example. Stopovers with no borders. In theory they're subject to the laws of their mother country. - But in reality... - They're not. Precisely. You remind me of Cloquet. You do know him, don't you? I believe we met in '99. Did you know he'd joined the Bank of England? Right, his name's Paul. It might be interesting to exchange ideas with him. You know, my dear Giancarlo, we have friends who would be most interested in your activities. Don't we? I already have a lot of work with my own clients. What a beautiful diamond. There. That's interesting. Exchange ideas with Cloquet? Why not? But... Didn't you know that Paul was out of favour? He lost credibility when he persuaded a group in Qatar to buy 500,000 Enron shares. Now no one will trust him with a single dollar now. The Bank of England is a safe haven for people like him. Weren't you expecting to meet someone like me? I must be prejudiced. Against Turks or against women? No, no. It's a very pleasant surprise. I'm here on behalf of my family. The family is very important. Yes. Yours has shrunk somewhat. I hear your last remaining cousin is in hospital. Is he why you have returned from exile? Blood ties take precedence over personal choices. Elegant phrases can sometimes ring hollow, Mr Perrotti. We'd like to invest a million euros in cash. How would you like to make this investment? Are the funds readily available? The money will be here in five days. That doesn't give us much leeway. Don't feel obliged to accept. Why not? A million isn't much. - It's what I do best. - Really? I wonder. Why are you here, Mr Perrotti? - This is my job. - Oh? I thought you were here for your family. I get the impression you're looking to be disappointed. I hope your interest in appearances won't affect your judgment. Business is business. Geneva Airport - Switzerland - Hello. - Hello. I have a reservation in the name of Perrotti. Ah, yes, that's right. Your signature, please, as usual, Mr Perrotti. This side. Third floor. Enjoy your stay. Thank you. We've clinched a good deal. Yes, Marc? What is it? Ah, Girard. So? What happened? Tell me the week in Paris wasn't a waste of time and money. The food was good and I caught some big fish. Sukran Baka. Daughter of Abdullan Ilvan Baka, isn't she? - Yes, that's right. - Do you know who Baka is? Is Wenger involved in heroin smuggling, then? No, he just handles the money. Baka doesn't just smuggle heroin. He also sells weapons, women and influences. He's been smuggling cigarettes for 20 years. He exports a tonne a year to Europe and twice that to the United States. As for her, she has an economics degree from one of the top schools. Apparently, she wants to make her father's fortune respectable. The million euros is a test. She knows that if I'm a cop, I can't let it go without declaring it. A million? Wait a second. What's all this about a million? There was no deal. What? You let those bastards keep an eye on you at your hotel. The deal's going ahead. Wenger told me so just before I came back to Switzerland. He also said there would be even bigger consequences. We're being tested. We must be suspicious and play the game. Can you organise the investment for me? It's not that easy any more dealing with banks. I no longer have the power to let a million euros go like that. I must inform the Department of Justice and Police. I have no choice. Inform no one, especially not Ferrucci, or we've had it. You know what she'll do, given the deep water she's in. She'll use this to seize the money for publicity. So we arrest no one and the smuggling continues. This is my case. I have carte blanche to let the money into Switzerland. So let him get on with it, OK? Stop trying to cover your arse, Cambas. Leave it to us for once. We're onto something here. We've got the biggest drug smugglers in Europe. And there's more. We can catch Wenger and his Swiss middleman, a guy named Klein. What is this nonsense? Who is Klein? A crucial link between Wenger and Baka. That's all I know. I don't want to hear any more. Sort it out between you. I don't want to know. And I'm completely against these methods. Superintendent. Maroni, you're either with me or with Cambas. Next time you grass me up... - That was harsh. - No. Infiltration is teamwork. You know that as well as I do. With you at the back and us in front. They're merciless. They're afraid of nothing. The slightest slip-up and we're dead meat. Unless we're united, we're shooting ourselves in the foot. Have you ever tried to run with a bullet in your foot? You take things too much to heart. How do you plan to nail the pretty boy? Baumgartner. Ferrucci's case. Filed away. No further action taken. Contraband cigarettes. Perfect. Lisa? Lisa, it's me. Go away. Your shrink phoned. She said you missed your appointment. - I'm cured. - Liar. Show me, then. See? You come here so you can take off your mask. Don't tell me you don't enjoy it. The mask is like a drug, an addiction. It will destroy you. Not if you're there. Why don't you trust me? It's the artist in me. It's never far away. Are you thinking about her? Well? Did Hans send you? Sort of. I'm taking you on a carousel. Would you like that? No, this way, or we'll be seen. You'll never build up your child's personality by teaching her to run off like that. She needs order, rectitude. Elsa is very sensitive, you know. Your lightning visits upset her a great deal. Why don't you join us here? You could move into the top floor and watch her grow up. Not everything we do is for our own gain. Liar. You're running away from yourself. You're a coward. You don't have faith in your ability. My son a policeman! Marc, it won't always be like this. How do you plan to invest the million? Jean-Claude Baumgartner, trust fund manager in Lugano. He was caught investing Camorra money in Switzerland. Cigarette smuggling is more profitable than cocaine. Who was in charge of the case? - Madame. - Ah, so... Ferrucci didn't detain him. So Baumgartner is at large. You're not thinking of the Camorra to scare him? - Why not? - It's a technicality. If you nail him by blackmailing him, it will sink the investigation. Don't forget Ferrucci wants to save his skin. She'll have to cover us unless she wants a scandal to break. Risky. Very risky. I need some cocaine to bait Baumgartner. - Pure stuff. - You're crazy, Girard. Not that. It's not for me. Enzo and Anita, leave us, will you? How long have we known one another, Ren?? It's been a long time, hasn't it? You've always helped me out and I've paid you back. Go to hell. What about Antoine? Remember? The opium pipe? It was to cure my sore throat. At least Antoine won't talk now. This is blackmail. We're in the same boat, aren't we? You're a bastard, Girard. Milan - Italy OK, you've got the warrant. But he's suspicious. This time you can't mess around. Do you hear me, Giancarlo? - Our plan is at stake. - You're scared, Simon. You could easily have done what you always do. If the deal is as important as you're saying, it would be easier to share the sum and manage it effectively. - Klein doesn't like sharing. - Klein? He doesn't think you're capable of seeing the operation through. Who is this Klein who dares to say such things? He's my associate, no less. Your associate? And where is your associate today? If he wants to keep his distance, let him keep his distance. Do you always worry about what people say about you? No. Only when the rumour might reveal the secret behind my discretion. But I admit that in Klein's place I would have done the same thing. I would have badmouthed the newcomer. Personally, I'm not bothered about what those who are absent say. You're a free spirit. I like that. Mr Wenger, will you give us a moment? What I have learnt about your family speaks in your favour. But lots of people play a role and are not what they pretend to be. I don't have the same means at my disposal as you. Are you really your father's daughter? Sometimes we prefer to ignore the facts. The facts can be dangerous. This statuette... It's a copy. It's the symbol of fertility that interests me about this mother goddess. How can you be certain a goddess doesn't have an ill-fated face? What about you? Do you bring fertility or death? Mr Wenger, I've finished with Mr Perrotti. Lugano - Switzerland Go on, take it, sweetheart. Take a line. Well? Cheers. Have you got something for me? For me? All right. Christ! Thank you. You're gorgeous. Will you leave me some? That can be arranged, Mr Baumgartner. How do you know my name? My cousins in Naples have been wondering why you didn't go to jail. It's hard to trust you. You need to be put to the test. My cousins and I need you again. And this time you have no choice. Aspen Bank - Geneva Gentlemen. Giancarlo Perrotti. Your passports, gentlemen. Photocopy them. Thank you. Here. Right. This sum belongs to Miss Sukran Baka. For this investment I need to know where the funds are from. I can guarantee this sum. It comes from the sale of a fig tree plantation. Excuse me, sir. There's a problem with the passports. Is there a problem with the passports? All the accounting records needed for the deal are here. Please. Photocopy them. My family appreciates the quality of your services. Your father would never trust a man he hadn't looked in the eye. He's invited you to come and meet him. There's no time to lose. 57 million euros are currently in Germany. 57 million. Of course. The bank is under investigation for money laundering. We must withdraw the money fast. A jet will be waiting for you in the morning. Will you be coming, too? Do you know the price of an invitation to my father's table? I know the price of privilege and the value of meeting someone like you. Should you decide not to come, get back to me. - 50 notes for Perrotti. - I don't get it. Baumgartner is a criminal. - Do we put him in the cooler? - Are you kidding? He gets three times that for his trouble. And now I'm off to Turkey. Sukran has chartered a jet for me. Sukran? What about Klein? I aim to convince Baka to get him on board with the deal. It's the only way to trap him. If he's on board with the operation, he'll have to reveal himself. Could someone be good enough to keep me informed here? Mrs Ferrucci. What a pleasant surprise. Spare me your hypocrisy, Vastel. I gather you let a million euros go without carrying out any arrests. You've been bothering one of my sources. A trustworthy informers of ours says he was persecuted by you. Your methods are bordering on illegal. I had no idea. Superintendent Cambas wasn't informed about the operation. In the light of your actions, I'll handle the matter You don't have the authority. Apart from the current mission in Turkey, you can brief me on the case. I want a copy of the financial pages. You're abusing your position, madam. And you, Girard, are nothing but a hot-headed fathead. I'll be watching you and if I detect the slightest blunder, I'll take you off the case and send you back to the archives for good. Madam Prosecutor, this is a very delicate matter. We don't know yet whether this investigation will lead us to any files that involve Mr Baumgartner. Do you see what I'm saying? Girard is right, madam. It seems premature for you to intervene at this juncture. Should things turn nasty, which is unlikely, you won't be troubled. But I'm making the arrests. If it gets out of hand this time, I want you to be ready. That goes for you too, Girard. Once is enough. Superintendent, I want daily updates. Very well, madam. Learn to hold your tongue, Cambas. It's all very well for you. But not for me. I'm telling you, I'm sick of it. Right. You go to Turkey. You gain Baka's trust. You organise delivery and you take the first plane back. Interpol? Well done. What next? You're an idiot, Cambas. Tell me you haven't warned the Turkish police of our presence. - We're operating on their territory. - Abdullan Ilvan Baka is one of the biggest drug smugglers in Turkey. He greases everyone's palms. And you decide to tell them all that we're investigating him. Nice one. What do you think he'll do? This is Interpol, not the Turkish police. Your papers are ready. They'll never make the link. Well done! It only takes one corrupt policeman. I'll go alone as Giancarlo Perrotti. You two stay here. It's not your decision. Kocaeli - Turkey Welcome, Mr Perrotti. I get the feeling I've come at a bad time. On the contrary. We were just talking about you. You clearly don't trust us completely. I don't trust my mechanic, either, but I still leave my car with him. That's true, Mr Saki. We've met before. - In Paris, wasn't it? - That's right. - Welcome to my house. - Hello, Mr Baka. What do you know about me? That your name is Abdullan Ilvan Baka, that you are a major exporter of... fruit and vegetables, that your estate is estimated to be worth over $150 million, and that the assassination attempt on the Pope in '81 didn't come as a total surprise to you. I never accept an invitation without doing my research. You're wily, Perrotti. You were right to be frank. My daughter would have seen through you. She reads people's minds. Let's eat. My network is working perfectly. When you put money in good hands, there's something for everyone. Who exports your drugs to the west? Anyone who can get through your system. Anyway, we're in business now. You know too much to back out. Wenger and his girl are no longer useful now you're here. It's true, they're not very discreet. They weren't very meticulous in their search for a collaborator. And I'm not interchangeable. By the way, Klein arrives tonight. Are you bored with me already, Mr Perrotti? - Are you reading Proust? - Yes, I like Proust. He's curious. He's a shrewd observer. He didn't judge. What about you? You haven't escaped the prejudices of your upbringing. You're a modern European. Your reputation and pride are more important than anything. You're not wrong. And you're attracted to the depths, the shadows. You only trust a handful of people. Yes, but I'd do anything for them. Is that what you want from me? My father wants to entrust his war chest to you. Despite my warnings. He refuses to let it go. Is that why you've agreed to run this risk? Is it your pride that permits you to risk the family estate? My father worked hard to transform these arid hills into verdant gardens. He was a stubborn man. Why do you use the past tense? My father is ill. Yes? Hello, Mr Klein. See you this evening, Mr Perrotti. The director of Aspen Bank would be delighted to continue working with people like us. But these days it's not that easy to invest such a sum in a single cash payment. It would wiser to collaborate with Mr Klein, for example. Don't talk to me about Klein. That bastard is wasting my time. I've been working with him for years, and now... he refuses to cooperate and cancels his trip at the last minute. Isn't he coming? Giancarlo is saying it would be wise to split the sum in two. No, I have no time to waste on these little games. The money must leave Germany immediately for Switzerland. I've got smugglers. I just need bankers. OK. I'm your man. Give me the green light to persuade Klein, I'll seal the deal. Fine, but I'm telling you, if you want to invest this money, you must let me handle it. If you succeed, you'll have nothing to worry about. Give me your word that you'll let me manage your affairs in Europe and I guarantee you that, with Sukran, when you are no longer around, your laundered fortune will secure your children's future and your grandchildren's. You are ill, Mr Baka. You know too much about me and you talk a lot. You're ridiculing me, Perrotti. Perrotti? Sukran holds you in high regard. I hope she's not mistaken. Here we kill thieves and pigs. I gave them money. I helped their family. And these two policemen betrayed me. They've been stealing from me for over a year. Klein is great. This is no less than I expected of him after all these years. He's sent us the names of two Swiss spies. Klein says you're the third. I say he is. This is your problem. It's up to you to resolve it. I work in finance. This is not my field. But if there is no trust, there's no point. The deal's off. I understand Mr Klein's reluctance. It's all clear now. You didn't tell me the police were on your tail. I have clients to protect. The risks go with the job. You spoke of three men. I can only see two. They're policemen. If you get rid of them, you'll create such a furore you'll no longer be able to invest a single dollar in Switzerland. You'll be needing me, Mr Baka. Goodbye. Cambas! - Why did you let them go? - I had no choice. - Did Ferrucci authorise it? - I won't... You've sent two cops to the slaughterhouse. Baka has no scruples. He'll shoot them. I saw him do it with my own eyes. Easy! And that's not all. Do you know who grassed them up? It was Klein. He's the only one who knew the identity of our men. - There's been a leak here. - You don't mean... I'm telling you, there's a leak. Word spread from here. We must catch this mole or the investigation will fail. Who knows the names on the passports? The Swiss embassy is working with Interpol to find our men and free them. We can do it. We can still do it, even if we don't know everything. I don't know by what means but in two days the money will arrive. The priority is to free Enzo and Anita and find the mole. Then we can catch Baka. And Klein. Let's not forget Klein. Yes? Hello, my dear friend. The borders are not that straightforward. It's simple. One load for D?sseldorf with two passengers. OK. Hello. How are you? Wait here. Thank you very much. What the hell are you doing here? Where were you? I've been looking for hours. You're not on board any more. Wait, Simon. You have no right to throw me out. - It's finished. - You still need me. I introduced you to Klein. Simon! No, no! Simon! Simon! Please. You need me. You need me. Still here? I can't take any more, Lisa. I don't know who my allies are and who the mole is. I feel as if I'm not in control any more. Yes? This is crap, Giancarlo. The aerodrome is crawling with cops. I hope they're not here for my plane. I'm going. Don't worry, Simon. I'll try and find out more. Shit! I'll call you. - Arrest them all. - Excuse me, madam. - Where are you going? - Ferrucci, public prosecutor. These men are suspected of trafficking. These men have diplomatic immunity. I cannot let you intervene without authorisation. - You are obstructing our inquiries. - It's the law. Do you even know their names? You'll create a diplomatic incident. I will take full responsibility. Don't prevent me from doing my duty. I am sorry but I am bound to abide by procedure. Shit. Well I never. Look at that. Klein with Ferrucci. I've got you. Shit. Fuck. Enzo and Anita have arrived. They're fine, yes. Wait, before I put her on... Marc, how are you? You were most impressive. You saved our skins. Thank you, Marc. It's good to hear you. Make the most of the break. Have a holiday. But Anita, I need your skills, my darling. I need Ferrucci's phone tapped right away. See to it and don't tell a soul. I will. He sends his love. Hello, sir. Hello, Vastel. I've just found the bodies of Helena and Wenger. Mehmed's men have done a good job. It seems she was planning to leave Switzerland. The bitch. She had a packet stashed away. I get the feeling she wanted to escape on her own long before Wenger discovered what was going on at the aerodrome. I'm beginning to understand. Helena betrayed Wenger. She sold Klein the time and place of the delivery of the money. Fuck. I'm coming, Ren?. Fuck! Hello. I don't understand your insistence, Giancarlo. A man who loves money hates to share. I'd rather see this through. But as a precaution I feel I must put Klein on the case. I hope you know what you're doing. You entrusted this case to me. Let me handle it my way. I'm not convinced. I think you're hiding something from me. And I'm not often wrong. I gather you were at the aerodrome. What were you looking for? I have nothing to say to you, Vastel. Why don't you ask Girard how he managed to get rid of two of your suspects? - Be serious, Mrs. - Stop messing me around, Vastel. Ledoux and Maroni are back in Switzerland. And the money is here, too. 57 million. I want to know where it is. We're going to collect it as soon as possible, madam. Very well. I demand that you take Girard off the case immediately. This is my investigation! - You are not authorised! - What if Girard has swapped sides? Have you considered it may be him who grassed up Ledoux and Maroni? He knew they'd be released. He's proved his affiliation to Baka by getting rid of Wenger and his companion. I'll say it one last time. Girard is to be taken off the case with immediate effect. Otherwise, I'll take great pleasure in sacking you, both of you. Lisa, I need you. - Whatever I do, I'm in deep shit. - You don't know how right you are. You must stop. That's my report. I'm sorry. You, too? I seem to be losing everyone I love. You don't know how to love. You're the one who's not clear. Shit, Lisa. I'm a cop. Let me finish the job. Don't send this report. - Don't make me betray you. - You're betraying yourself. I'm going to send it, Marc. Hello? Ferrucci has sacked me from the case. Well? Are you happy now? I'm sorry, Marc. Hello, Vastel. How could you have done this to me? It's out of my hands. I can't cover for you anymore. But, Marc, when did you ever do as you were told? Let's finish this. We'll sort it out later, OK? Marc. Be reasonable. Watch out! Police! We've got you, Girard. Hands on the wheel where we can see them. Get out of the car. - Get out. - Sorry, but I'm Italian. Put your hands on the roof. Go on, love. Have a good grope. You're a bastard, Girard. Where were you going dressed like that? Are you the mole? Are you working for the Turks now? I'm going to drag you through the courts and sink you for good. - Are you still running away? - Where's the money? Where's Baka? Where are they? Just calm down. - I want to talk to you in private. - Stop it. You've got the wrong target, Cambas. I'm not the mole. It's Ferrucci. Why do you have so little trust in me? We may not have the same methods but you know very well I'm not corrupt. Listen, Cambas. I've got them. I can bring them all down. All of them. Do you hear me? Klein too. You're insane. I can't let you do that. Do you know who Klein is? He's my brother. I've got to finish him off. That'll do. I tried to persuade my father to pull out. He's not the type to take back the trust he's placed in someone. You got him to place his trust in me. I'm here to honour that trust. Perrotti. How are you? Better than Wenger and his companion. Why did you persuade my daughter to let you bring Klein in? Don't you trust your own abilities? Did you know Klein was at the aerodrome with Ferrucci? Wenger phoned me. I went to the aerodrome and saw Ferrucci with her informer. I hoped Klein would be here tonight to reveal his identity. He's the traitor. I think this is a trap. You'll soon find out. - Go and get him. - And make sure he's not followed. We'll wait for him together, Mr Perrotti. I'll get you some fruit, Father. Leave us. Sukran? She protected me. She's yours now. What makes you think I need protection? Tonight the masks will fall. Mr Perrotti, allow me to introduce Mr Klein. Pleased to meet you, Mr Klein. Haven't we met before? You look familiar. I don't think so. Mr Baka, it's out of the question for me to join this operation. - Are you joking, Klein? - I recognise you, Mr Klein. You're Alexandre Girard from Banque Girard, are you not? How is Prosecutor Ferrucci? Don't listen to him. He's lying. He's a cop. Kill him. You've always been pathetic, brother. Baka, tell them to drop their weapons. Mehmed! Come out with your hands on your heads. You're a dead man, Perrotti. I will have my revenge. Get down on the ground. He's one of ours. Leave him. Leave him to us. I never doubted you, Marc. Mrs Ferrucci. This is nothing to do with me. Quiet. You're under arrest. Everything you say can be held against you. Cambas, seize the money and take all these people. Girard. You know what the law has in store for traitors like you. I'll see to it that you are made an example of. Where is the daughter? No idea. Make sure my brother is protected. I'll do what I can, I promise. "Ferrucci cleans up the bankers' act." "Infiltration is a dangerous game." "A woman of the law." INFILTRATOR "Undercover cop." "A police infiltrator is the subject of an internal inquiry." The bitch! Good to see you're still in one piece, Girard. Gentlemen, you can leave us now. Look at this. As usual she's taken all the credit. As usual she's managed to clear herself of any suspicion. Marc? I've been waiting to give you this. It's Ferrucci. You bastard, you were right again. Listen to this. Ferrucci and her friend, Klein. What would it cost you to let me off the hook? Forgive me, Alexandre. My job obliges me to apply the law. - After all I've done you? - You have been amply warned. I have to go. Someone's on the other line. Why didn't you tell me my brother was on the case? Hello? Hello? Where did you get that? I got it off the internet. They should have been more careful. This will never stand up in court but it's enough to launch an internal investigation. And... you know what that means. One day Elsa will find out what you've done to us. I wouldn't like to be in your shoes. Nothing will make me change my mind. - Are you coming to collect me? - Yes, I'll be here. - Promise? - I promise. OK. Bye. Come on. Quick. Despite the control systems put in place, money from drugs, arms dealing, sex slavery and the bloodiest dictatorships continues to flood in the tens of billions into the coffers of numerous banking institutions in Switzerland and abroad.
