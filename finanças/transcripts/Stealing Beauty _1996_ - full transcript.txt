Hello. Is anybody here? [Bird chirps] [Girl laughs] Diana. Diana? Mmm. Hi. Lucy. Oh, Lucy. We were waiting for you to call. Lucy: I got a cab. Diana: Come on in. Ian, wake up! Lucy's here! I can't get over how grown-up you look. I hope so, after 4 years. Is Christopher here? Well, he was supposed to turn up yesterday for my birthday, but he's still floating somewhere around Turkey with his friend Niccoló. Niccoló Donati. Do you remember him? Yeah. Lucy. Welcome. Ian: Welcome. Welcome. Hi. How are you? I remember all of this exactly, just from one week. The bees. You don't bother them, they won't bother you. See? We fixed up the old hay barn. Only took us 20 years. When we came here first, there was nothing... No water, no electricity. Cost us every penny we had just to buy the place. Lucy: So why'd you move here, then? Work. There's a great tradition of art in these hills. In the room next door, you've got Alex Parrish, old friend of ours. He knew your mother, too. The writer? Been very sick. Distressing for everyone. I hope you're patient Because... I fumble along a bit. You'll help? How? Let me look at you. Not all the time, I hope. You won't even be aware. So get settled in. Have a swim. We eat at sunset, but... come up before. [Man coughing] Is this your slipper? I suppose so. Do I know you? I'm Lucy. I am Guillaume. Enchante. Here for a visit? Ian's doing my portrait. It's really just an excuse for my father to send me to Italy as a present. Hey, where is Signor Bruno? I have a dream to tell him. Hey, you forgot your slipper. Oh! Merci, mademoiselle! I'm going to go for a swim. Bye. Merci. Jesus. I thought you were drowning. I was wondering whether I was going to have to haul you out or not. You're Miranda. You were here before, weren't you? 4 Years ago. Your brother was here, not you. Well, I don't really live here, but we come every year for mummy's birthday to console her. Christopher's so distracted, he couldn't quite find his way out of Turkey. With Niccoló. Do you know Niccoló? From... from last time. You don't smoke by any miracle, do you? Not really. Richard freaks out when I smoke. When are they coming back? Who? Your brother. Who knows? They said... [Footsteps approaching] Miranda: Richard! Hi, babe. Oh, and this is... You know, uh, Harmon's... Mummy's friend's daughter. Lucy. Miranda: Lucy. Oh, my god. You're Sarah Harmon's daughter. Your mother was a great poet. I'm, uh, Richard Reid. Really, really honored to meet you. It's my mother, not me. Yeah, but she made me want to be a poet. I mean, I think it would be great, you know, just to sit around all day and... express yourself. Richard, I never knew you wrote poetry. Well, honey, I never did. I don't have a creative bone in my body. But I did become an entertainment lawyer so that I could be around creative people, like Miranda. I design jewelry. I apprentice with this real asshole in New York. But he's a genius. Is this yours? Yes, but that's old shit. You going in? How is it in there, Lucy? Quiet as a tomb. What? No, I'm losing your voice. You sound like you're at the bottom of the sea. Ah, ah, ah, listen to this. [Speaking Italian] [Laughter] Who was on the phone? Miranda? Who was on the phone? Christopher. Diana: What did he say? They're not coming back. What, never? Well, I don't know. They... they missed a connection or something. I couldn't hear. Those naughty boys. I bet they're being very naughty. I'm sure they've gone beyond naughty by now. [Richard laughing] Noemi writes a lonely hearts column called Ditelo a Noemi, "tell Noemi." Ha, ha, ha! Has quite a following. Oh, here it is. I have a picture of mom in this dress. She said after she got married, she was going to be fat and happy and had no more use for it. Of course, she never gained an ounce. Slip it on. Diana: You could wear it to the Donatis' party. They give a lovely one every summer. You could be Sarah 20 years ago coming to help us fix up this place. She helped you fix this place up? Well, with a lot of hash breaks. I think it's a little long. Why don't you get up here, and I'll pin it. Your mother needed to risk things. I admired the recklessness in her. It was so not me. I thought it brave. I couldn't live the way she did. I'm not the type. Neither is Ian. Do you know... I think we've been faithful to each other For 20 years. Can you believe that? Yes. Most people can't. [Billie Holiday singing I'll Be Seeing You] Billie Holiday: ♪ I'll be seeing you ♪ ♪ In every lovely summer day ♪ Very strange, that father of hers. He's never cared about my work. He hated the portrait I did of Sarah. Why does he suddenly want Lucy to come here? Maybe it was Lucy who wanted to come. Now she's here, stranded with us old fogies. Speak for yourself. I'm sure she'd rather be out chasing boys around on a beach somewhere. Seemed rather serious to me. Being chased... 19 is all about boys. You know, I caught her looking at a picture of Christopher. Christopher? Why not? She's 19. Not sleepy? No. Not at all. Have to finish Daisy's dress. I must switch off all the lights. I'll try not to wake you up when I get in. Come here. Good-night kiss? Another one? You were 19 once, I suppose, weren't you? I suppose I must have been. [Knock on door] Yes? Excuse me, but you wouldn't happen to have any more of that exotic brand of cigarette I can smell, would you? Hi. It's not my best play. I really liked it. It's the one they'll remember me for. I'm not contagious, you know. I always smoke this way with other people. One doctor even gave me three months. One said a week or two, depending. According to the third, I should be dead as we speak. I tend to... think of the first doctor as being the wisest. Lucy: That's terrible. You're not one of those moralistic young people, are you? What do you mean? I mean sex. Do you disapprove of sex? No. Nothing more transporting, I seem to remember... Except perhaps good grass. I wouldn't really know. I haven't really had it that much. Grass? No. Sex. Hmm? You mean you never slept with anybody? No. A beautiful girl like you? Well... Do you remember my mother having a pair of green sandals? Sandals? I think so. She could have. She wore wonderful clothes. [Coughs] Excuse me. She was the best-dressed poet. Writing transporting little... verses in between fashion shoots and... Why? Why have you never wanted to sleep with anyone? It's not that I haven't wanted to sleep with anyone. Hmm? Tell me. It's not as if I'm going to know for very long. There was this one guy that I really liked. I met him in the summer when I was 15. Mm-hmm. He was the first person I really kissed... and, um, we wrote each other for a while. There was this one letter about, um, him having an animal Prowling through his heart, and I memorized the whole thing. But then after a while, they just stopped. And then your mum died, and everything stopped. Hmm? It's not because of my mother. Her death has nothing to do with it. It's easier to stay alone. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy. You can't have decided that at your age. I haven't decided. You're in need of a ravisher. I'm waiting. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy... Would you stop saying that? You're scared. What is it you're scared of? There's something else, isn't there? I can see. You seem to be... Stoned. I'm going to bed. Don't forget this. Thank you. [Sniffs] Sweet dreams. Well, look who's up and about. I had a great night. You met Lucy. Oh...She's irresistible. I'm mad about her. Now, what's that smile about? What smile? Now, come on. Tell. Mm-hmm. Well... We just...talked. What did she tell you? I have a feeling... not as much as she might have done. Oh, come on. No, no, no. You can't keep a secret. Of course I can. Really? Noemi: What's going on? Nothing's going on. Noemi, what would you tell your readers about a man who dangles a secret in front of you? I wasn't dangling it. Yes, you were. No, I was not. He wants to tell it. [Alarm beeping] Diana: We're going to have to find Lucy some friends so she doesn't get bored with all us old people. Noemi: Are we that old already? Good morning. Hi. Sorry. My time's all screwed up. Want some coffee? Please. Have some bread. [Telephone rings] Do you take milk? Yeah. Oh, hey! Uh, no, it's fine. Um, what time is it there? Do you take sugar? What about Filippo Castellini as Lucy's boyfriend? Okay, Miranda. Terrible flirt. What about Harry Fenimore Jones? No. Too perverse for an American girl. Would you pass the sugar, Noemi? Ben Cartaclay. Cartaclay would love Lucy. Diana: Basta! Thank you. I feel like a classified ad. Do you hear that? Come and see what we have to put up with. All right? Yeah. Talk to you later. Bye-bye. [Banging] What is that? [Speaking Italian] They're building a television mast. Diana: To brainwash the Italian electorate. You don't like it because it messes up your view. Diana: Daisy! My little piglet. How was Camilla's? Again? Hi, Daisy. Do you remember Lucy? You were 4 when she was last here. Hi. Hmm. What's that? It's called a scarab. It's kind of like a beetle. It's good luck. Come. Okay. Well, thank you for being so fucking helpful. Miranda, you wouldn't stop. Me! It wasn't just me! Oh, she's searching for something with those long hands she can barely control and... curiosity. A little bit frightened. It reminds me so much of me somehow. You know, I kissed someone here once. Did he touch tongues? Uh-huh. Miranda likes to kiss boys. She'll kiss Richard, and before that, she kissed Matthew and Johnny and Niccoló and David. She used to kiss Niccoló? Yeah, at the fireworks. Do you know a man named Carlo Lisca? Yes. He lives near Caorle. Why do you know him? Mama used to get letters from him. What's he like? He's a very good war correspondent... But I think... seeing so much death and blood and... horror has made him a little peculiar. Well, I'll ask him over. You can meet him. Do you remember her being in love with a man here? You mean Carlo? I don't know. There was... this thing that she wrote about. Really? What did she write? Ian: Lucy, I think the time has come. Off you go. He's gone to the studio. You know, he hasn't worked at night for years. But there's a virgin in the house. It's cool in here. My father never came here. No. I never met him. He's small. I'm 5 inches taller. Really? Maybe if you could concentrate on... on that horse's leg, for instance. Might help you to keep still. Oh, but I see how you're different from your mother. You have a sort of joy in your eyes. H-h-have you ever eaten olive leaves? No. Olive leaves are inedible. Disgusting. Why'd you ask me that? Just asking. I can feel the night behind me. You see why we love it here. There's one thing I miss, though... The Grevediggers. The best pub in Dublin. I think we've done enough for tonight. You've been very patient. Good night. [Moaning] Man: I love to fuck pumpkin. Oh, I love to fuck my little pumpkin. I love to fuck pumpkin. I love to fuck my little pumpkin. Oh, I'm fucking, pumpkin. Oh, Poop is fucking pumpkin. I'm your daddy, baby. That's good, baby. Oh, yeah! You like it, baby? Miranda: Yes! Richard: Tell me you like it. Oh! Miranda: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! No! No! No! No! Yes! No! No! [Crash] Richard: No! Shh! Shh! Where's he going? Shh! Don't wake him. You must never disturb sleepwalkers. Ha, ha, ha! Here comes the Marquis de Saab. Noemi. Michele. Carlo! Diana: Carlo Lisca, Monsieur Guillaume. Richard: Come on and play! Come on! Is that Sarah's daughter? Mmm. Lucy. Aah! Miranda: Richard, sweetheart, we're going to go have a swim. All right. Just a second, babe. Hey! You get back here! Whoo-hoo! Ya-hoo! Ha, ha, ha! Richard: You get back here, young lady! Aah! I'm right here. Richard, are you coming or not? Stop it! You Carlo? Yes. My mother used to mark a star on her calendar every time she got a letter from you. I was very fond of your mother. We had many jokes together. She appeared the delicate woman, but she loved to act vulgar. That's not what I remember. I remember her sitting awake all night in the dark smoking cigarettes and listening to jazz records. Everyone has dark moods. Do you? Only when I am away from war. Around war, I am as light as a souffle. You ever killed a viper? Of course. I grew up in the country. Did you ever meet my father? It's not what you think. We had only one night together. That's all. Only one night? We were friends. Lucy? See you later. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't think he's the one. Not for you. Not for my Lucy in the sky. Actually, I like him. You do? There's something familiar about him. My illusion's shattered. Come. Let us bring up the rear... Like Turgenev's poor Rakitin. [Laughter in the distance] Oh, look. [Man yelling] Oh, god. What? Alex: I can't bear it. It's too unnatural. Come on. They're not going to bite you. Carlo: I felt I was being interviewed by Lucy. Diana: She's curious about you. She's so sweet. Can you imagine Sarah being a virgin at 19? Carlo: It's their generation. They are terrified of disease. What about Christopher as your boyfriend? Who told you that? That's what Mommy told Noemi. Oh, hello. Christopher! Crazy Daisy. Piglet. Piglet. Hey. Here. The Turkish flag. I remember you. Lucy. Hi. Sorry. Did I interrupt you? This is the last time I carry your bag. Hello. Don't tell me you've forgotten Lucy. Lucy Harmon. Lucy? Niccoló: Lucy. Of course, it's you. Osvaldo. Yes. I remember her. Come to dinner tonight. I'll get mum to call. Good. So I'll see you very, very soon.

So, Lucy Harmon, how long are you staying, and what do you think of Italy, and when are you going to come to our house and see how real Italians live and change your life forever? You didn't even recognize me. Excuse me. Miranda: I decided I had to get rid of it one summer Before I went back to school. Darling, are you speaking of life before me? I ended up doing it with the same guy my best friend did it with. He was the local... deflowerer. Hmm. God. Please. Ow! Fuck! Jesus! Aw, shit on a stick. Well, that's what pot's all about. There you go. I wonder how we got on this subject. Miranda: And there were girls Queuing up around the block To see this guy. We had 10 minutes with him. Exactly 10. No more, no less. Christopher: God, Miranda. I remember that guy. Oh, he was repulsive. Miranda: He was creepy, I must admit. I don't remember mine at all. I was completely drunk. It was in a car. It was snowing. Richard: I was 11... tripping with my baby-sitter. Lucy? What about falling in love? None of you even mentioned falling in love. [Speaking French] [Translating] There's not love. There's only proof of love. And what about you, Osvaldo? I don't know which is more ridiculous: this conversation or the silly political one going on over there. What about you? No, not me. Not you, what? Love. That's not a word that I use. That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. I think I miss a lot of trouble that way. I think I've missed a lot of you. Oh, my god. I'm sorry. That's ok. That's ok. You've been too far away. [Man gasping] [Banging on door] Yeah? Richard: Yeah. Hey, Lu. I was just wondering if maybe, uh... I could, um, bum a smoke. I thought you hated smoking. Ah, yes, well, don't tell Miranda. Jesus. Have to quit someday, I guess. I have never been down here. Huh. Oh, so this is, like... the view. I get it. Ha, ha, ha. I have a loft in New York. Although, I must say, the bathroom wasn't completely exposed to the entire room. Ah, what have we here? You do write, huh? Sorry. What do you write about? Your fantasies? I mean, you do have fantasies, right? Everybody does. You know, there's this exercise that actors do to explore their fantasies and to shed their inhibitions. Have you ever tried that? Giving up control? Like what? Like, get on your knees. Ha, ha, ha! Right. On my knees. I'll show you. Okay. You go first. Okay. Now... on all fours. You're kidding... No talking. Now... Go to the mirror. Slowly. Open your mouth. Tongue out. And lick. Good. And lick. Good kitty. [Laughing] Rrr. Rrr. Lick. [Both laugh] Now, touch your tongue to my tongue for the ultimate connection. [Lucy laughs] Miranda: Um, Lucy, I was just wondering... Oh, Richard. Hi, sweetie. Wh-what's going on? Richard: Uh, well, we were just, uh... You know. Wait. Wait. Miranda! Miranda: Quite frankly, I don't know why you even bothered coming. Either you're jogging your ass off somewhere, or you've got your ear glued to that bloody phone. Plus, you reek of aftershave. What were you two doing in there? Nothing. Nothing? For Christ's sake! You're in there sniffing around her like a dog! Miranda, I was explaining the Lee Strasberg acting technique. No. I'm sorry.

Miranda: What's your rank? Man: Lieutenant. Miranda: Here. Have a biscuit. Lieutenant: Well, thank you. Don't be cross with me. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. We're all going to a pizzeria for dinner, if you want to come. Yeah? I think I'll pass on that. What have you done? It's just a scratch. That's terrible. No, wait. I'll do something about it. I've got stuff that's going to do that. I'm going to clean it up. Here, put it on my knee. Come on. Oh, we have to clean that up. Alcohol? You know... You mustn't let it get to you. What? Us.

Oh... Hey. This is Gabriella. Christopher: Sit down with us here. Diana: Lieutenant, have some bruschetta. No, thanks. Garlic gives me gas. Oh! Get the shit off the table. Here we go. I can't piss in that shit pile. Did I say something wrong? No, no. He's a very well-known art dealer. He's legendary, but sometimes he has these little episodes. Mr. Guillaume is very theatrical. Up we go. The angels talking again, Mr. G. I think it's time we took the angels home to bed. Diana: Oh, Gui. Perhaps I could help? I think we can manage. Thanks. Ah, mon ami, I'm sorry. I haven't a car for you. Good night. Richard: Good night. Good night. Daisy: Bye, mummy. Bye. Ciao. Lucy, want to play? Daisy, Lucy is helping daddy with his work. Miranda, want to come and play? No. I'm not in the mood for playing with piglets. [Richard speaking German] Richard, want to come play? Richard! Come w... Ow! [Whispering] Uh... [Telephone ringing] Oops! Oh! Oh! Daisy: Take that! [Hits tree] And that! And that! And that! And that! And that! Oh, if I'm not ready now, I'll never be ready. You're free. Ciao! [Starts chain saw] So when did Gabriella leave? This morning. I asked her to. Why? I wanted to see you. Lucy. So this is an olive grove? Yes. You looked very beautiful back there. I could not take my eyes away. Like this. I need to kiss your mouth. After this long time. Wait. Please. Lucy... I'm dying for you. I'm dying. Not here. I can't. I can't! No! Stop, please. Stop. No! Stop! What is it?! [Bell tolling] [Lucy crying] [Door opens] What's the matter? This was my mother's From right before she died. It's about me. "Where have they gone, the green sandals? "I was not made to be a mother. "I had too stricken a heart, "so I wore green sandals to stay apart. "Then one night, a man stood in an olive grove. "He beat a viper till it bled, "then drew me down low. "One night was all there was. "He fed me an olive leaf, and broke... the..." "the strap of my dress." Alex: Come here. "I kept... "I kept on the green sandals, "but I could not get off that hill. "Italy, where did you take me "that night so black... and still? "He had an accent and a knife, "and somewhere, even, had a wife. "He took my face and tore my hips, "and planted in their place something new and strange "and near to love. "I thought I had nothing left, but you came later, "curved anew. "Forgive me. "I did not have the means for catching "when I got poor Lucy, "you." It's my real father. So it would seem. It's not you, is it? Can you picture me beating a viper? I don't even know what a viper looks like. I thought it was Carlo Lisca. Really? But I'm not sure anymore. Just forget about it. I already have a father I love. No, no, no. I was never very good at... asking for the things that I needed. Have you ever been in love? Lots of times. No. Just once. [Alex sighs] Alex. Alex, are you ok? [Alex gasps] Hmm. I'm sorry. I feel a bit grotty today. Here. Can I get you something? I'll be all right. Don't fuss. I'm just feeling a bit... Rough. That's all. Don't give up. You'll find him. You won't disappoint me. Well, don't you look nice. Can I see? No! I mean... I never let anybody look until it's finished. Does it look like me? It's not supposed to. It's not? Of course not. Didn't anybody ever tell you That the true artist Only ever depicts himself? Thanks a lot. You sure you won't come? It's been the same for the last 20 years. Why should tonight be different? I thought life with you was going to be one long party. Not so. Bella. This reminds me of dances I used to go to when I was a girl. Silly, isn't it, to feel homesick in a magic place like this? Beauty wounds the heart. [Cellular phone rings] I can't believe you actually brought that thing. Noemi: You know, something surprising always happens every year at this party. You'll see. [Band playing] Come on, just a little more. Carlo. [Bell tolling] It's Christopher! Yeah. Bearing a torch. Oh! Hello. Hi, Christopher. Diana: Is this what you want in life? Richard: I didn't realize He was a, uh... He was what? Uh... Oh, Lucy. Darling, would you hold that? Uh, sure. Fine. Can I do you a favor? What? Wait. See. It looks like a spaceship. See? It looks so much better. You look beautiful. Thank you. Carlo. Would you like to dance? Now? Now.

You've been getting what you want, when you want it. So I'm supposed to be grateful? I can already picture your next summer on Nantucket with some WASP heiress. Excuse me. Have I misled you in some way? Whatever happened to... "what you see is what you get," huh? Oh, come on. This isn't you. I know you. Tell that to your wife. Tell your wife how well you know me. All right. I'm going to call Dr. Signorelli. Oh, god, no. He smells like rotten meat. Mmm. Alex, you need more help. Did Lucy choose a good one? She chose her first one. It's ludicrous, isn't it? What? About to snuff it, and still... Still chasing tail. Huh. That's how you are. Thank you. Thank you for what exactly? Nothing. Right. Hee, hee, hee! Bye. Ciao. [Car starts] [Buzzing] Doctor: Ciao. Diana: Ciao. [Car starts] Uh. Better? Yeah. Great. Oh, give me a cig, Ian. Oh, for god's sake, Alex. Have you ever actually bought a cigarette? I bought a cigarette the last time you bought a shirt. [Alex singing softly] Diana: Alex. It's like being in a parade, isn't it, darling? All the bloody doctor's fault. You know, I'm quite able to walk. If you could see yourselves. [Whispering] I don't want to see him at the hospital. Oh, that's fine. You stay. Say good-bye to him. Hi. Ah, Lucy. Let me see if you look different. I didn't really. Oh, you mustn't mind me. I so enjoyed watching you. All that beauty. Aren't we lucky? Hmm? Ah, there's my girl. Take it with you. Mmm. I'll share it with the nurses. See you. Mmm. [Sanding] Do you... remember where you were in August 1975? Mmm. We bought the house in the spring of that year, so we would have been here, I think. Why? It's when I was conceived. What? Oh, nothing. You look like something. Ah, it's just that... Thinking. What? I think that was when I did your mother's portrait. That's what I thought. I couldn't be sure. Diana would remember. But, no, no, no. She was in London then, sorting out her divorce and the custody of the kids. Be no point in asking her. It was one of the few times we've ever been apart. No. I wouldn't ask her. These are for you. So am I... done? What? Oh. Almost. Can I see now? Ian: If I show it to you now, it must be our secret. Okay. You can keep a secret, can't you? Yes. I learned from the master. How did you get to be such a lovely girl? [Bees buzzing] Oh! Fuck! Come. Come with me. Where did they get you? Here. This clay is good for it. Are you ok? I'm not dying. And... here. Here. You better do it. Come walk with me.

You did not. I didn't sign it, so you probably thought it was from Niccoló. What was it about? I don't know. How much I liked you. How I thought of you when I was in the woods. You wrote that letter? I loved that letter. You didn't write that letter. I don't believe it. That was my favorite letter. I knew it by heart. Dear Lucy, I'm on the top of the hill... Wait. Alone with my dog and thinking of you. Where are you going? This is my tree. You must miss your mother. Lucy: I can't even picture her face. [Crying] Why are you crying? Because I want to kiss you. I'm not... I'm not able. [Speaking Italian] I can't. I want to leave. What? Here. What are you saying? I want to go home. This is home. Not really. This is where Daisy was born. I don't want to die here. I want to die where I belong. You're upset about Alex. And... moving is not going to change that. I'm getting tired of taking care of people. I want to go back. I want to go back... Where it's... gray... damp... and the milk goes off. I feel... I'm not... this anymore. We can't go back, Diana. I put Richard on the train to Pisa. Did you? I'd had it. Oh, darling, good for you. Oh, Mummy. Did you think I was mad? No. We all have ones like that. Where is everybody? Gone. Mmm. Ha, ha. Bonsoir. Bonsoir. Buona sera. Buona sera. Ciao. What's for dinner? I'm starving. Chips? Daisy: Where's Lucy? Could you... help me? [Lucy gasping] No. Stay. I want to come with you. Now? No. To America. Then do. It was my first time, too.
