BASED ON THE NOVEL BY JUSSI ADLER-OLSEN A CONSPIRACY OF FAITH Assad. Not now. Come on, Assad. - Come on. - I'm working, Rose. - One round. - I'm working. Come on, Assad. - One round. - Have you been practicing? A bit, but I need to practice on you. Hook! - Good! Come on! - Tighten those muscles, Assad! Carl Merck. Leave a message. I have a new case for you. A message in a bottle. - Only you can solve it. - Who's that? - Pasgard. - Where's Morck? You didn't know? Jacobsen sent him on sick leave. I don't blame him. He was worn out. Completely out of reach. He just sat there, completely blank. Well, you know Carl. - But this time it was really bad. - Rose. - Sometimes it's as if. - Rose! He's fine. He'll be back tomorrow. Where did you get this? A retired army guy found it on the coast. For some reason he thought it better to hand it over to the police. Have fun. Nice to meet you. - Bye. - Bye. - I'm Rose. - Right. Pasgard. This is blood, isn't it? Yes. It could be. - Send it to Microbiology. - Sure. Carl. - Hi. - Hi. - The door was open. - Oh. What's going on? You should have been back at work. Yeah, I yeah. - Let's take a walk. - What? Put on a clean shirt and let's go. Yeah. Remember to fold your hands. Good Lord. Almighty Lord. Beautiful Lord. Hear us, your faithful servants. Your eternal servants. The chosen ones. Elias. Come. Come. I baptize you in the name of the Father. I baptize you in the name of the Father. We haven't seen you in church for a long time. I know. Time flies. It must be over a year. You have a beautiful farm. Very beautiful, wonderful fields. Beautiful place. This isn't a farm anymore. Just a house. I had to sell off the land. We're fine. Elias got a job at a market garden. I do the books for the congregation, so we get by. Elias. What's important is to have your family and your faith. Yes. Good night, Mom. - Good night. - Good night, Dad. Good night. - Good night, Father. - Good night. - Is it true? - Yes. Magdalena has been named messenger. For the entire region. Listen, Magdalena. You have a light in your heart. Just like your mother and father. - Good night. - Good night. What can I say? It has been fantastic to see you again. I am very blessed. Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice trip onwards. Thank you. God bless you both and the children. Thank you. I guess we'll see you in a year, then. - "Bus stop". That's easy to read. - Yes. And there. Maybe "children"? Yes. "Mom and Dad" is clear. We know the bottle has been in the sea for a long time. The algae are at least six years old. The letter is written in tar, so maybe it was thrown from a boat? A lighthouse. So maybe it was thrown out close to land. It is blood on the paper. A lot of blood, in fact. And someone's name starts with a P. I think it was written by a child. Because "man" with an E. "Mom and Dad". And look at that "us". "Us up". And that looks like an I like in "lock". Doesn't it? - Right. - "Locked us up." Say you need help and you write a letter. What would you write first? - Your location. - Or your captor. Yes. "A man", right? - "A man called" - Right. A child would write "called" like that. With an O instead of an A. Hang on. So it says: "Jehovah will - \ Save us n. "Jehovah will save us." Jehovah's Witnesses. Check missing children within the last 10 years. I'll send out an email. Know how many children have gone missing in Denmark the past 10 years? Two. Both times the press had a field day. But neither a P nor Jehovah's Witnesses were involved in either case. Nothing. Well, thanks, Carl. Hi, guys. Quite a mouthful you've laid on me. I scanned it using seven different negative color codes and got zilch. - Infrared was a dud, too. - So you found nothing? Wait. Then I thought: What originally erased the letters'? - Can we see? - I ended up mixing natrium. Thanks. What does that say? "Lautrupvang". Sounds like a location. There's a Lautrupvang in Ballerup. "There were other children here." None of our children have disappeared. - Have any children been abused? - Well, sadly that's less unusual. We think it may be a Jehovah's Witness child. - Trygve? - Excuse me? I had a young Jehovah's Witness boy called Trygve - - but he seemed like a happy boy. - When did he attend the school? - Just a moment. Trygve Holdt left this school in 1st grade at his parents' request. At his parents' request? May I see? It says here the children didn't come to class on Tuesday morning. Next day the parents say - - they sent the children on a religious revival trip to Australia. I don't know what goes on in those people's heads. Help me understand this. The children drop out of school overnight to go to Australia. They never return, and no one at school checks up on it? - There's no need to put it like that. - How do you want me to put it? We've done everything by the book. The children. You said "the children". So there must be more than one. Poul Holdt, 4th grade. - He must be Trygve's big brother. - Poul? Poul Holdt. You found your P. Let's just find Poul and his brother. They're fine. They're both fine. They just changed schools and are going to crack up - - when they hear we found their message after all these years. Yeah. - Can I see? - No. - I'm going to tell on you. - We're allowed to look at pictures. Not of short-haired girls with make-up. - Are you sure you're allowed? - No. Look at the moons on the belt and the shoes. Hi hello? - Hi. - Hi. Do you want a ride? No, it's okay. We'll walk. But it's such a long walk. We're used to it. What if it rains? - It's okay. - Sure you don't want a ride'? You'll be home in two minutes. I thought you were leaving. Yes, but I forgot something in church - - so I thought I'd say goodbye to your mom and dad before I left. Sure you don't want a ride? I'll let you sit up front. Would you like that? Okay. - No! - Sit down. - Let me go! - Sit down. Let me out! Stop! Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. T-r-y-g-v-e. Trysve. I have his parents' address here. Christian Holdt, Ballerup. Oh dear. He was found dead in his bed with his wife. They'd each swallowed what amounts to six months' supply of sleeping pills. The theory was that it was part of a religious ritual. Jehovah's Witnesses don't have suicide rituals. They don't have any rituals. They just sit there and talk. - The cops are here! - Take it easy. - Fuck off! Get out. - What's your name? Sit down. - Just sit down. Sit down! - What the fuck are you doing? - Sit down. - Sit down! Calm down. - Don't touch me. - Calm down. Sit down. - What's going on? - Don't talk to them. Trygve! - Don't say a fucking word. - Trygve? We're here about a letter from your big brother. What do you mean? I don't have a big brother. Trygve. - We know you have a big brother. - My big brother went away! I don't know him. I don't know where the hell he is. Fuck off! Just fuck off! We wait. Assad. Can I see the letter? - Hi. - Shit! - It's you, Christian. - The door was open. - Who else should it be? - I don't know. I'm so glad to see you. I just hate being by myself. It smells of rotting seaweed. And saltwater. My big brother was there too. Both of us are tied up. - But he's alive? - Yes. I remember a loud noise. A constant noise. Of what? I don't know. A factory a road. I don't know. The same metallic drone outside. - Can you recall it? - What? Can you recall the sound? Yes. The man who took you. Do you remember what he looked like? I couldn't do anything. He forced me to watch it happen. He took his scissors. He's dead. - Poul is dead. - Shh. There. Shh. - Calm down. - He stabbed him with the scissors. They said that if I ever told anyone, Jehovah would punish me. Viborg Police Station, hello. You'll be spending the night here. Let's talk some more tomorrow, okay? You didn't see who grabbed the child? We'll look into it. A man walking his dog saw a child being forced into a golden car. - 8 km west of Skals. - It could be anything. An argument, a playful parent. I'll send a car to look into it. - The bottle was found here. There. - Why stay within that circle? We eliminated the Kattegat strait. The currents wouldn't carry it that way. The boy said the perp spoke Norwegian. Can't it have come from Norway? Oceanographic Institute say all sea currents there go north. - It's impossible. - It's a huge area. We'll just focus on the coast. It's a bit hard to throw a bottle into the sea from downtown Herning, right? - Sure, but there are the inlets. - And the Wadden Sea. - If you have a boat. - Trygve says it wasn't a boat. It could be a beachfront house, a boathouse, a shed. - A houseboat. - Whatever. Department Q, Rose speaking. You hinge your investigation on a 15-year-old crystal meth addict? Investigating that area will eat 0.4% of our entire budget. It's not gonna happen. Fine. We'll work on Trygve and try to narrow it down. We also have the sound that Trygve heard. - We can try to establish what it was. - Okay, listen. What are we looking at? A child disappears. The parents don't tell a soul. - That's pretty strange. - Yeah. Some sects make their children do weird stuff. Sects? They're Jehovah's Witnesses. That's. - What the hell? - And it happened this morning? Hang on. Viborg Police, responding to our email. A witness saw a child being forced into a car outside a village called Skals. Guess what that village houses. A religious sect, The Lord's Disciples. - We have to check it out. - What's the problem? - Let Viborg Police do it. - Marcus! Extend my leave by a couple of days. I want to visit relatives in Jutland. Right, man. You haven't seen them in ages. - Uncle Jorgen? - Right. He's got eye trouble. - Aunt Esther. - Her too. - All of them. - Suffer from cataracts. What a shame. That's bad. I feel sorry for them. The Lord's Disciples believe Jesus was born in Texas. We're obviously dealing with retards. It's great to have you back at work, Carl. - Are you being sarcastic? - Spare me this conversation. - What conversation? - This one. Faith is many things. It's all the same. Jesus born in Texas. God in heaven. Some guy in a cave thinks he's a prophet because a winged man told him so. - It's psychotic. - So you think I'm psychotic? When it comes to that issue, yes. Carl, we go back several years. You've never taken an interest in my faith. I hoped you'd come to your senses. That it was a bad habit, like smoking and homosexuality. Carl, I don't believe that I'm going to Paradise - - or up to meet my family when I die. But I believe in something larger than us - - and that makes me happy. Get it? It doesn't mean I'll switch off my brain or grow a navel-length beard. - Something larger than us? - Yes, Carl. It's not all that strange. Most people in the world share that belief, man. As long as they don't kill each other. - That's just so fucking easy. - The truth is easy. What do you want, Carl? Do you want me to join your religion? - Watch your blood pressure. - You believe in a black hole. That nothing means anything. No thanks. I'm just saying: With that attitude you'll never enjoy a pork roast. That's not funny. Hi. - Assad. - Lisa. You don't waste time. You do know nobody's been reported missing? - Yes. - Is that a list of the congregation? Yes. I've marked all the families with school-age children. - There, there and there. - Thanks. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me? What did you expect? That we'd let you interrogate people without anyone from the local police? Yes. - So you're a social worker or what? - No, I'm an investigator. But we can talk about your childhood if you want to. We're with the police. Carl Merck. We'd like to ask you a few questions. What do you want? We're asking people around here if they've seen anything unusual lately. A witness saw a child being forced into a car. We want to hear if anyone's seen anything. No, I haven't. You have two children, right? Samuel and Magdalena. - They aren't here. - No? No, they're with their aunt in Sweden. Excuse me. May we come in for a moment? We don't let strangers in. Especially not his kind. His kind? Because he's a city boy? We're in the middle of prayers. As I said, I haven't seen anything. Bye. That sure as hell wasn't normal. You have to be quiet. Hush Be quiet. I don't care about being quiet! - No, it was lower. - You mean deeper? Let's pitch it down a little. What do you do outside work? You're asking me? Why do you ask? - You must have interests. - Sure, I have lots of interests. I'll get a beer. - Yeah, she's nice, Carl. - What? When was the last time you asked a girl out? Must be about a week ago. You haven't seen anyone since your divorce. No, exactly. - Here you go. - Thanks. What's going on? It's Wednesday night. It's a public holiday tomorrow. Ascension Day. What? What day were Poul and Trygve kidnapped? 11 May 2008. Could that be Whit Sunday? We think he kidnaps the children around religious holidays. - Do a national search. - Good to meet you, Lisa. Everyone. Even a mere scrape at the E.R. Within a week of all religious holidays. Carl, shut up and listen! December 2008: A member of House of Christ in Remde, Birgit Torp - - reports her two daughters missing. Later that night - - she calls off the alarm. The family now lives in Thailand except the youngest daughter, Cecilie. She seems to have vanished from the face of the earth. - Rose found one more. - That's not all. You asked me to find something on Elias and Rakel Steensgaard. And I sure have. No, let me just. Let me open this. Your eternal servant. Your servant. Your eternal servant. Hear our prayer to you now. We need you, Lord. We need you. I looked at your magazine. Look at it. Look at it. What do you think Mom and Dad would say to that'? Look at me. Only God can help you now. You must pray to God to save you now. Pray! Your servant. Your eternal servant. Your servant. Your eternal servant. Our Father, which an in Heaven. Hallowed be thy Name. Stop speaking in your father's language. I won't hear it anymore! Again! - Our Father. - In Danish, I said! Again! Stop it! Elias, we need to talk. - I have to go to work. - You've liquidated all your capital. Pensions, company funds, Rakel's parents. 670,000 kroner all in all. What do you need that money for? Listen to me. We had a neighbor check on your sister in Sweden. Not a child in sight, Elias. Listen. Stay out of this! How did you find out about all this? Who are you? Take it easy, man. We just want to know what happened to Samuel and Magdalena. You don't get it! If he finds out I talked to the police. - Stop, Elias! - This isn't his first time. Last time only one of the children came back. So let's talk! Talk! But I won't talk to him. They're here for the children's sake. Don't you see? Come in. Both of you. Carl. - What? - Shoes. This is the children's room. Magdalena sleeps there. Samuel. What. We hadn't even started worrying about them when he called. - He called you here? - Yes. - And he spoke Norwegian? - Yes. - Yes? - He said he had Magdalena and Samuel. And he told us to withdraw all our money. He knew exactly how much we had. What did he sound like on the phone? Young? Old? But we know him. His name is Johannes. You know him? Yes. Yes. He's been to the church a few times over the last 2-3 years. He claimed to be a missionary from the congregation. He had dinner with us the day before yesterday. Right where you're sitting. Johannes probably isn't his real name. You haven't got a picture of him? - No. - How does he want the money delivered'? I'm to put it in a bag and get on a train for Hamburg tonight at 7:15. He'll call me on the way and tell me where to hide the bag - - and then I'm to get off at the next stop. As soon he has the money, he'll release the children where they can be found. If we don't do as he says or if we tell anyone - - he's going to kill them. But not until he's made sure they can't go to Paradise. He's going to do things to them. So. You see why we can't involve you. Right. You're still to deliver the money, but we have to be there. - No. - No. What if he sees you? He won't see us. We won't intervene until we're sure we can catch him. - He's done this before. - I won't have it! - He's killed one child. Maybe more. - But I won't have it! The other children's parents let him get away with it and haven't told a soul - - because they had more faith in God than in the police. I'll ask you again: Can you live with not lifting a finger to save your children? Carl, take it easy. - Can you? - Take it easy, Carl. Elias? They're your children. You decide. But Carl is right. Unless we stop him now - - you won't see both your children again. No. - No. - Yes, Elias. - Yes. - No. We can't do it on our own. If anything goes wrong and you're to blame. I promise we'll do everything in our power. 11 stations between Hadsten and Hamburg. We'll have two men on each platform. Two men will board in Randers, one will board with Elias - - and two patrol cars will follow the train in case he escapes in a car. - 25 plain-clothes officers. - That's plain clothes. - No Windbreakers and skinny jeans. - Fine. I'll put on a blue suit. We have 5 hours to get everyone in place, so you'd better get moving. We need a helicopter in case something goes wrong. If we lose sight of him, or he sends someone to get the bag in his place. - Will Carl and Assad be on board? - No, in one of the cars. What am I missing here? 28 men and a helicopter to handle one arrest? We're dealing with a ransom case. We don't even know if he's armed. - We don't think it's about the money. - He's toying with these families. He spends years making friends before abducting the children - - always on religious holidays. He made a 7-year-old boy watch his brother's murder. We know of at least one sibling pair, in 2008, where a girl disappeared. He's not a kidnapper. He's a serial killer. If we lose him tonight, we may lose one of the children. Maybe both. Anything else before we engage? We know he speaks Norwegian. Other than that, we only have this sketch. He left no leads for us, neither now nor in 2008. He called Elias and Rakel from a stolen cell that was later found in a ditch. This guy isn't stupid. - I have to go now. - Yes. - See you. - Yes. Chopper 1 here. - Helicopter 1 calling Carl Merck. - Merck here. Have you checked out the train route? The road takes us up to 4 km from the train. Remember to say "Heli, Bravo, Whiskey, over and out," Carl. - What? - Or else he can't understand you. I'm not 12. "Hello Bravo", what? "Heli, Bravo, Whiskey, over and out", or they don't know you're talking to them. It's important! Heli, Bravo, Whiskey, over and out. Yeah right, Carl. Funny! - Stop joking around. - Sure. Sorry. - Rakel, can I give you a hand? - Distribute the Bibles. The train is pulling in. Elias ready? Elias. The train to Hamburg will be arriving shortly. Need a ticket? The ticket machine is right over there. - Stop glancing around. - Thanks. I'm glad you came with me. Why do the Danish police hire all kinds? Beats me. Stop glancing around. He might board the train here, so from now on we don't talk. Have a nice trip. Why did the message in a bottle wind up with us, Carl? I mean, why now? Right before all this happens? If we hadn't got it, we'd never have known Samuel and Magdalena were taken. We can save two children because we got a letter that's been at sea for 8 years. Are you trying to say that God sent us that message in a bottle? What if it's true, Carl? If there is a force that protects us? Standing by in railcar 23, seats 33 and 34. That propels us all toward good if only we're open to it? - Cut the crap. - Stop calling it crap, Carl. Do you want to talk about goblins, too? If you want to be my friend, stop being so fucking arrogant about my faith. You're embarrassing. How can a bright guy like you believe in that nonsense? It's a bit hard to take your opinion on right and wrong seriously. You've got half your life left, and you've already given up. Don't you ever ponder the mysteries of life? No. Chopper 1 here. The train is departing from Hadsten station. He's calling. - How far are we? - 2 km away. - Yes. - They've made contact. - I see him. - What railcar are you in? - 22. - Go to the nearest restroom. You have 30 seconds to get there. Let me talk to them first. You've got 30 seconds to get there! Don't ask me again. Elias, focus. Go to the nearest restroom. - Where are we? - Take the next right. In front of you on the right you'll find a red handle next to the door. - Hold it down to force the door open. - What? - Do it. - I can't. No more questions! Do as I say, now. - He's opening the door. - What door? He opened the outer door! He isn't on the train. He isn't on the train! - Pasgard, which side? - He opened the outer door. - Pasgard, which side? - Right. What are my instructions? Don't make a move yet. - Prepare to throw the bag. - Assure me you'll free both of them. What do you mean both of them? Who said you'd get both of them back? We have visual of the train again. We can see Elias. In 15 seconds you'll pass a gate and a forest. Prepare to throw the bag. - I want to see them first! - Elias. Do you want to see your children again or not? - You're mad! I know you're lying! - Do as I say, damn it! Elias. - Where's the next crossing? - What? - The next crossing? - In 2 km. The train is heading for the forest where our view will be restricted. Throw the bag in three seconds. I'll kill them if you don't throw it. Now! Hello? Elias! Fuck! He lumped! A man jumped from the train. We have no visual contact. Carl! What the fuck are you doing, Carl? What? God's protecting us, isn't he? I repeat: A man jumped from the train. - What did that mean? - Rakel, calm down. Calm down, Rakel. Sit down. Come here. Carl, where are you? Carl, come in. Where are you'? Elias. Where are my children? Do you see me now? Elias! Elias! Carl! Carl, get the helicopter! There's nothing to see. Where are you? - Send the helicopter back! - What? Elias must go to the hospital asap! Elias? Elias? The police won't disclose much about the operation - - which apparently went very wrong and ended with - - a man about 40 years old jumping off the train to Hamburg earlier tonight. There are speculations as to whether it is a ransom case. Witnesses say the man's two children haven't been in school for some days. We have unique footage of the incident. Why. Why is it my children ...? Why? You promised to help. You promised. And now Elias is lying upstairs. My children. I won't see them again. And it's your fault. You did everything you could, and she knows that. How long have you had that, Carl? What? I've seen a lot of our colleagues who've been through nasty things. You need help, Carl. You're shaking like a leaf. Oh. I'd better do something about that. Better infrastructure in the countries will bring long-term investments - - beneficial to the people's interests. In the case of the two kidnapped children, we've been unable - - to get a statement from the head of the investigation, Carl Merck. Look at me. Look at me. Do you see me? Yes, please. - Yes, please. Yes, please. - Hi. Who are you talking to? What's going on, Christian? I'd date it to around 1993-96. Can you zoom in? - Look at her eyes. - Yes. - Did they find any prints in Vejle? - No matches in the database. Neither in Denmark nor in l.F.A.D. Yes? There's a man on the line claiming to have info about the children. - Should I put him through? - Yes. - Hello. - What do you believe in? - Who is this? - Are you a man of faith, Carl Merck? Yes. You've done a very stupid thing. But I'm sure you know that. Yes. I know. - We should have let you be. - I 'd say that's a correct assumption. I don't blame you for being angry. Both of the children will die now - - and it's your fault, Carl. I think your focus is more on me than on the children. What do you want? Just tell me what you want. - So maybe we'll meet. - Hello? Hello! Hello? He's here. He's here at the hospital. He's here. He's here! - Seal off all exits. - What? Seal off all exits. Elias. Mrs. Steensgaard, he's waking up. He needs a doctor. What's going on in there? Why didn't we hear the alarm? - Hello. Can you hear me? - Elias, are you there? Can you hear me? - I need help. - We need to get a doctor. Intensive ward 3-14. We need a doctor. - Elias! - Immediately. We've got a pulse. 20 over 21. - Johannes? Johannes? I know. - One, two, three, lift! What? Pulse? White coat? Was he wearing a white coat? - Yes'? - Carl. He's disguised as a doctor. - What'? - He's wearing a white coat. Carl, he's wearing a white coat. Behind you. - Carl! - Elias, stay with me. Elias. Call in a cardiac arrest team. Would you like a priest? Have you got a priest here'? - Yes. - Is an ordinary priest okay'? Stay clear of the patient. One, two, three. Come. Lock the door! In there! Pasgard? Pasgard! No, no, no! Pasgard Pasgard! Calm down. What can I do? What can I do? Send paramedics to the parking house, level 3. Now! Carl, where are you? Carl! Carl, god damn it! Fuck! Fuck! HYDROCHLORIC ACID - He hasn't done anything. - Haven't you done anything wrong? - We haven't done anything wrong! - God doesn't want you! We haven't done anything! - Where the hell is he? - It's the last footage I have of him. And then he's gone. - Not on level 4 nor in the basement. - Did you check the cars? Where the hell are you, Carl? There. That cabriolet. It's not registered to any of the staff. We have a license plate: YJ 47512. Mia Hansen. It's a 30-minute drive from here. Okay, we want you all to listen to this. Trygve, who was kidnapped eight years ago, has identified this as the sound - - he heard day and night during his captivity. It's our only lead to where the children may be. I know there's a risk we won't find them or Carl alive. - We've eliminated various factories. - Could it be a generator? No, a generator has a higher tempo, more constant. Maybe his recollection isn't precise. You said it was near a boathouse, so it must be near the sea, right? Yes. I think I know what it is. Hi, Rose. Trygve's sound may be a wind turbine. We're listing residences in the circle - - where you might hear wind turbines. There are still many possibilities. Good, Rose. Becca. Rebecca Henriksen? - Assad. I'm with the police. - Is anything wrong? May I come in for moment? My brother speaks Norwegian. - But his name is Thomas. - Where does he live? He travels a lot. He's been living in Germany the past couple of years. He's CEO of a pharmaceutical company. He bought me this house. He's always taken good care of me. We're looking for a man who kidnapped two children - - from a sect called The Lord's Disciples. He's done it many times before. Yes. Always siblings from very religious families. - I heard it on the news this morning. - Rebecca. Could it be your brother? Rebecca. He doesn't live in Germany. He has a place in Denmark near the sea. She says he has a boathouse by the North Sea. Start with places near wind turbines. Continue up the coast and then head north west. Don't mind her. It's just you and me now. Do you know what I am? You've done this before. One thing at a time. Answer my question first. Do you know what I am? No. I'm the Devil's son. - I know what it sounds like. - No I know what it sounds like. I don't think I'm the Devil's only chosen son - - because I'm not. I'm one of his many sons. You could call us his soldiers. The Devil's? Satan's? So that's why you do this? Hey. He came to me when I needed him most. Hi, Mom. He gave me strength when I was weak. And then I became his. Ever since. And so you kill children? As a sacrifice to him? Does he get their souls in Hell'? This has nothing to do with children. I see why it may seem so, but it doesn't. I've just found a way to serve his final purpose. That's all. To defeat God, I rob the devout of their faith. First I rob the children, then the parents, the family. They all lose their faith and it spreads, and now. And now. Now I will rob you of your faith, too. You're wasting your time. I don't believe in God. I believe in jackshit. Johannes." Johannes. Johannes, listen to me. No, no, Jo...! No! Listen to me. Take me instead. Take me instead. Take me instead. Samuel. All your life you've saved people you never met. Of course you believe. Samuel I've never met a believer like you in all my life. Johannes, he's just a little boy. - He didn't do anything. - Yes, he's just a little boy. - So why doesn't anyone help him? - Take me instead, Johannes. Johannes! Samuel, look at me. Samuel! No, no, no! Johannes! Johannes! Johannes, take me! Don't you wish God would give you the strength to stop me'? Johannes, get him up. - I think you will remember this day. - Get him up. Listen to me. That you were here and that it didn't change a thing. And God never came. Johannes, what Listen to me. Don't do this. Take me instead. Take this - - and get your revenge. Then you'll be his, and he'll set you free. Stab me. Stab me and you'll be free. You disappoint me. You have seen, and now you have to live with this. I see a house in the sea. Assad, go down there. Find Carl and the children. We have to land ashore. Magdalena. Free my wrists. Find something over there. Cut the plastic strips. Hurry. Come here. Samuel! Samuel! Hurry! Just put me down here. Come back. - Samuel! Samuel! - Samuel. Samuel. - Carl! - He's out there somewhere. - Are you okay? - I'll stay here. You and all the rest have to live on - - grateful for all you were given through Poul. Albeit short, his life gave you a precious thing. You will live on, Trygve, confident that he is with God now. Just like we are with God. For God reaches beyond Death's limits - - creating a bond between the living and the dead. And gives us hope that life is stronger than death. - Amen. - Amen. Beauty around us glory above us. Lovely is earth and the smiling skies. Singing we pass along pilgrims upon our way through these fair lands to Paradise. Ages are coming roll on and vanish. Children shall follow where fathers passed. Never our pilgrim song joyful and heaven born shall cease while time and mountain last. First to the shepherds sweetly the angels sang it at midnight a song of morn: Glory to God on high. Peace and good will to men. Today is Christ, our saviour, born. Let's go. Thanks. I've always looked at those kids thinking. What silly fools. So full of dreams. They have no idea. But maybe it doesn't matter. Subtitles: Helle Schou Kristiansen Dansk Video Tekst
