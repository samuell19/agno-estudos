1998/2/14 Huh? 20 YEARS LATER A first breeze of spring had blown... ...in my insatiable quest for pleasure... ...I was too weak to stop before it was too late... ...since I... Damn. Yes? I'm Ms. I'm from next door. It seems my laundry got blown away... and landed on your balcony. - May I go... - I'll get it. Wait. Here. It's not mine. It's my roommate's. Yes, of course. - I'm sorry. - It's fine. I should apologize. It's OK. Well... Is there anything else? I hope you didn't think... You are Professor Fuyuki Tashima, right? You know who I am? I read all your books, sir. They're not that great. But there's one I couldn't find... My debut? It was quickly removed from the shelves. I looked for it everywhere. Well, you see... I have a copy somewhere. Huh? I'm sure. Would it be too much to ask... If you could possibly... If I'm not imposing... Right... Sure... I'll search when I have time. - Thank you so much. - Sure. Alright then. Let's see. About here. It has to be here. Not there. Happy Valentine. Thank you very much. For me? I'm sorry, I totally forgot. You're unusually light-hearted. - Nope. - I knew it when... you recommended a Pouilly 2008 to a customer today. That shows your excitement. I told you there's nothing at all. Kyoko, you're not a good liar. - It's a man. - That's silly. Bingo, I gotcha! What kind of man? Are you seeing him today? You are wrong, I just moved home. Apt 603, Sunshine Mansion in Fuchu. There's a writer I used to like... living in the same building. Fuyuki Tajima? Right. What a weird coincidence. I discovered it just today. It was such a surprise. Come on, you moved there on purpose. That's silly. I told you it was a surprise. I'm home. You're late. The boss harassed me with questions. That old virgin can be creepy sometimes. But he gave me a bottle. I see. - Naomi... - Yes? You know today is Valentine's Day. A day to celebrate men. This has nothing to do with us. Right. It still reminds you of that day? It's not all bad. If it wasn't for that accident, we'd never have met. Sure. But was it really an accident? Good evening. Who the hell are you? Huh? I'm Tajima from next door. I found that book you were looking for. Right. The Self Within Myself by Fuyuki Tajima The Self Within Myself by Fuyuki Tajima That girl who was abused by her parents. Most people didn't like it. What the hell? Who was that? You promised you'd only talk to men at work. What's wrong? Are you alright? We don't need men. Kyoko, I'm here for you. No, don't do that. No! Stop! I can't. You find men repulsive, right? Kyoko and Naomi seem to enjoy themselves. Good morning. Good morning. I'm going to work now. I work at 'Bistrot Framboise'... Enough, don't be a hypocrite. Was it you? Did you come yesterday evening? The book I lent you yesterday... was so boring you had to trash it? You mean, she trashed it? Is that a kind of joke? You were even posing as a fan. I'm so sorry. I get it now. I must be the only person left who still values my work. Please. Welcome. Damn, you look old. Alright. What are you doing here? Well, I need to get my lunch. What? It's so expensive, I can't afford anything. The money. Pen. Wait. You'd better call, if you want me off your back. Who was that? - My mom. - Huh? But you told me she passed away. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. If you don't mind... What are you doing here? I was concerned. You threw Fuyuki Tajima's book into the trash. Sorry? But it was so kind of him to lend it. Kyoko, you broke your promise. With Mr. Tajima, it's not like that. Hey, come on. Kyoko, I'll protect you. From your mom. From men. You can't. You can't do this here. What if the boss came now? That would be awful. He's busy cleaning up. See how girls please each other? Who needs a man's cock? Huh? Come on, let's go now. I'm hungry. Huh? Sorry, Naomi. I want to go home now. Good evening. Good evening, sir. You were not alone in there? What? Another woman was talking to you. Sure, I was on the phone. Right. Obviously. On the phone. Has to be that. That loser was out there listening. Come on, you staged it all on purpose. Pardon? Yukari, I'm not like you. Nympho. What? What is a nympho? Haru, that's a word you don't need to know. Did you see his cotton undies? He was so cute. There are four personalities dwelling within me. I have a split personality disorder. That means... I have multiple personalities. THE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A MURDERER Really... I'm so sorry about the book. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got angry. You didn't... I'm always so sensitive about that particular book. When I wrote it... I was in love with the protagonist. You Ioved her... despite her disgrace and her history of abuse? Huh? KILL I didn't do that. Then who did? Don't know. Yukari is obviously teasing you. I'm sorry to cause you concern. I'll always be by your side. This is never gonna dry. Alright. How much do you earn? - Savings? - But why? This ain't enough! But... Is this how you take care of your old mom? You're right. Good morning, Ryo-chan. Good morning. Who's that? My lit-tle sis-ter. She's too shy to be your sister. That's right. I got some unexpected cash. Let's see. There it is. Thank you, Yukari. Wait, my chewing-gum. You're such a cutie. Come on, Ryo-chan, you just woke up. Alright, alright. A kiss here too? - You're crazy. - Yukari. Wait, let me get this. Hello, yes sir, thank you for calling. Sure, I'll come today. Thank you for your continued patronage. Hey, it's not coming. You got it now? I got your number. Alright, I'm sending it. Who's the lucky guy. We're all set. Let me see. Now. Send. What? Send me one more? Yes. I got it. You got it. Got it. Now it works. Our little secret. Behave now, naughty boy. Alright, alright. I'm calling you later. Are you really Kyoko? Don't you recognize your own daughter? Poor old mom. That's a breech of our agreement. You can't swap without Kyoko's consent. She was floating there like a duck on a pond. I lost my cool. Haru, it's your bedtime. Yeah. Looky there. You're going out again? Who do you think you are? My mom? Please. You're acting weird. Please, for today... You girls are such wusses. Your life is passing you by. You'll be old in no time. Kyoko! I'm not Kyoko. My name is Yukari. You're going by your mom's name again? Huh? You're such a naughty girl. More! Yukari! Yukari! Hey. You really enjoyed it. Tell me. Hey. Yes. Where's Ryo-chan? Did something happen? Ryo-chan hasn't come home. - Did you call him? - I can't reach him. He's not here! You whore! I can smell Ryo-chan's scent on you! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! Mom, please stop! Mom. Ms. Sakuragi! What are you doing? Hey, stop! Stop! What are you doing? Just like you did as a child! You just want to steal my man! - Stop! - Whore! - Let me go! - Stop! Stop! Sorry. I'm so sorry... you had to get involved. Have you always been... You should go to the hospital. Yes. Bye. You know... Why did you retrieve it? It's a bit messed up. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Did you read it? Did you like it? She was abused. You don't have to like it. It's fine. Well. There's just one thing. At the end... she is lucky enough to find happiness. Although her parents didn't like her. She found someone who loves her. That made me happy. I kind of saw myself in her. It's for you. Huh? But... The moment I saw you... I immediately feIt it. You're so similar to her. That's why... So, maybe... I will meet him some day. The man who will love me the way I am. Please... Yes. I'm sorry, I don't know why I did that. Sorry, Kyoko is not good with men. You'd better stay away from Kyoko. A body was found in the back alley of a residential building. He was later identified as... Ryouta Minegishi, 38. His severe head injuries... led the police to open a murder investigation. I told you I don't remember anything. You don't know how you came back? You don't know if you had a fight? Gimme a break already. She's stupid but she wouldn't kill anyone. What? What are you trying to say? Sometimes I can feel it. A beast inside of me. Something lurking in my body. You're wrong about that. But... In the last 20 years... the four of us have always been a team. We still are now and we'll always be. Am I right? Life would be so much easier without those bitches. That's what you're thinking, right? You feel we're out of control. People around you see you as a freak. All those personalities, those unwanted passengers. How can you say that? Kyoko... never lied to us. About last time... Don't you dare approach Kyoko again. What ever you believe is going on... you're only messing up her life. Who... would you be? If you value your life... keep clear from all of us! Ms. Sakuragi. Excuse me. Is Ms. Sakuragi here? Fuyuki Tajima. Right. She's not working today, she called in sick. I see. Thank you. Kyoko! I'm not Kyoko. My name is Yukari. You're going by your mom's name again? You're such a naughty girl. Hey. You really enjoyed it. Hey. Hey. - Let's go. - OK. Kyoko! I know you're here! Open up! Hey, what do you want? Where's she? I don't know. I'll call the police! l'll call them! What? Wait! I was about to piss my pants. Enough, get out now! What are you looking for? What the... Come on! Just forget about Kyoko. Men die quickly around her. Come on. Ryo was killed too. I'm sure she did it. Don't be silly. She started by killing her father. Huh? Well, he was her stepfather. Such a nice man... He bought me an apartment. He bought her clothes and toys. How old was she? How old was she then? She was about 10, I think. You're talking about a child. But you know she's not anybody. A split personality disorder. There. Anything else to drink. - Nothing else. - Figures. Sorry for the disturbance. You know what she is? She's a beast, that's what she is. Kyoko. Yukari Sakuragi, born November 25th, 1956 Please... excuse me. Excuse me. It's delicious. Yes. So delicious. I can have wine too. You'll have to wait a few years, kid. Easy on the red, you're a nasty drunk. Come on, it's a special day. Let's celebrate. Celebrate what? Huh? Hello. This is the Metropolitan Police. Are you Yukari Sakuragi's daughter? Yes, I'm her daughter, Kyoko. What? Can't be. My mom? Listen! I did it. You are professor Fuyuki Tajima, right? You know who I am? Mr. Tajima too? You want to kill him too? Yes? Hello. You're really doing this? It's enough. I don't want to kill anymore. I see. Forgive me. It's fine. It's your body after all. You've all been so kind... through all these years. We've been through a lot together. But it was such comfort to have you. You all made me... always so happy. We'll die together, right? Ms. Sakuragi! Open up! Go away! Ms. Sakuragi! Mr. Tajima, don't come in! Just mind your own business! Open up, Ms. Sakuragi! Ms. Sakuragi, open up! There's a beast living inside of me. There's nothing I can do. It will keep on killing and I can't stop it! Ms. Sakuragi! It will kill again. It will kill you too, Mr. Tajima! I don't care about that! If it's you... I'll gladly die by your hands! Go away! Especially Mr. Tajima. I don't want to kill him. I won't. I love you... Kyoko. Ms. Sakuragi! As she was choking me, she told me: "If you really love me, now is the time to show it." And I thought how delightful it would be to die by her hands. With that intent in my heart, I closed my eyes. At that moment... I felt a soft rain on my face. It was her tears. You are the man I love, however... since you are a man... my hate for you is as bottomless as hell. Forgive me. I don't see how your life... would ever fulfill my love.
