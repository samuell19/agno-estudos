Life... seems like a very long journey to everybody. But... nobody knows when the journey ends. If every moment is lived happily... then life will be beautiful, right? Affection. Love. Care. Those who are in pursuit of these desires in their lives... are uncertain when their search will end. But when it does end, there is no point in dwelling on regrets. At times, the lives of the people we love... fade away before our very eyes. Do we have to regret the loss? So, is that all for love? For affection? Or care? Boy! Boy! Mom! Mom! Yes. The 17 Malaysian ringgit on the table are gone! It appears that your older sister took them all this morning. Mom... I need to refill the petrol for my bike. I need to eat at college. Didn't she receive her salary yet? She spends all her money to buy face powder for herself. That's why I told her to find herself a boyfriend. But she doesn't listen. She's already ruining my life. Do you want her to ruin another man's life too? Come. A man will be grateful to get a girl like her. She's two different people when she washes her face and when she puts on her makeup. It's like killing two birds with one stone. Boy, will you take me to watch the fireworks on Independence Day? It will be crowded and noisy, Mom. If it's crowded and noisy, then it's a festival. If it's quiet, then it's a library. You talk too much! - Hey. Take this. - What's this for? - I'll withdraw from the bank. - Keep it. - You're overreacting. - Alagamma. Nowadays, you unnecessarily tease me. I'll leave for my lecture. After class, I have some work in the evening. Can you come back with Sister? Hey! I am familiar with KL town. Don't teach me about this place. I was not born blind. I know everything. Leave! That's my Alagamma. Hey, boy! Download and bring the Kolangal drama. Okay! Wow! You're too rich, aren't you? You come here every day by bike. Annoying fellow! I'm going to pour hot oil into his mouth. Hey, Jack! - Hey! - Where did you all park your bikes? Did they change the bike parking area? Hey! I'm in the classroom. Didn't I ask you guys to wait? Hey. Behind you! Okay. Did you drop off your mom? Yes. Well, why are you late? I'm on my period. It's too painful. I can't do anything. There is an advertisement for juice on television. "Taking three days off again this week?" Why not buy that juice and drink it? Buy it for me. What are you for anyway? The elephant possesses great strength and assumes leadership in the war, intimidating many individuals and prompting them to step back and show reverence. Some maintain a safe distance for their own well-being. The same fox that was frightened by the elephant and fled, that very fox... when the elephant becomes trapped in the mud... ends its life. From today onwards, we dedicate ourselves to our familiar path, forging ahead in the right direction, persevering, and not only helping ourselves but also others. Thank you very much. It's a very interesting subject. Your life is in your hands. This life... is being appreciated by how many of you at this moment? At this very moment, somewhere in the world, someone may have passed away. Someone may have been murdered. But... what matters is that you all are alive right now. Appreciate that. Instead of worrying... about something that has happened, take it easy and ask yourself, "So what?! I can still live. And I'm happy that I survived." So live your life with that thought. Joker! Hey, Joker! Have you ever been disappointed that you have got lower marks? - Silly boy. - Did it ever make you feel bad? Hey! I'm asking you, and you're asking him. No, sir. Most of the time... his answer aligns with mine, so can he answer better... - So... - Sir. No, sir. He's just kidding! - Tell him. - Why? Okay. I know he's just joking. But most of the time, people tend to worry about something that has happened. But there's no use in being that way! What's the point? In fact, to be honest, you're wasting the most beautiful moments of your life. Even I have a paralyzed hand. So what? I have another hand. Do you know why? Seize the moment. "Carpe diem." So, class. Go back, and read about Carpe Diem students. Signing off, Mayilvaganam. See you guys. Hey. What? Are you seizing the moment? Hey, Jack. I'm warning you he's betraying our club too much. - Hey! - Hey! - Is this the Engage phone model? - Yes. - Show me. - What about your previous one? - I sold it. - You sold it? - Yes. - Wow. It looks awesome. - Right? - So, are we getting a treat today? Bro, I don't have any money. What? Now you don't have money?! I'm getting a text. Let me see. So you're broke? Let's sell the phone! - Hey, dude! - What money is being discussed? Hey! - You saw it? - Don't change the topic! Bro, if you had sold all your drawings, you could've bought a new bike. Hey! Don't tease him. - How much is this? - So, Suriyan... You were late for the lecture. You came in right after she entered the class. She was late for class as well. So we decided to come in together. - That's all. - Great! Here! I texted Joker and asked him to wait. Hey, I'm fine with waiting for ten minutes. How do you expect me to wait for an hour? You wouldn't have studied even if you had come in earlier! Regardless, you're still going to copy my notes. You are a copycat. The cat just betrayed us. What do you mean? Who did I betray? Hey! You betraying me wasn't painful, but pretending to not know anything, that's painful! Joker! Batman! Sir? Come here. Coming, sir. I knew it. I knew something was up when he kept asking us to seize the moment! Now he's calling us. Come. Come. - Let's go. - Leave me! - He is very good-looking, right? - Are you stupid? Sir? Me? Do you think I'm unaware that both of you write the same answers? Believe me, sir. I am not that type of person. Don't act here. Go and act in movies. - Me? - Yes! Well, forget it. On behalf of the Indian Club, I heard you guys are planning to create a grand kolam on Independence Day. - Any updates on that? - Sir, I and Suriyan are working on it. We have prepared the proposal. We will submit it tomorrow, sir. Yes, sir. They will get it done, sir. You claimed that you're finished with it, but in reality, you haven't even begun. And you guys told him that the proposal is complete. You just began working on it! You delay assignments, and now this too? Will you let us concentrate? We are the ones doing it! Not you! Pass me the cracker. He's always like this! Hey, Jack. We need someone who knows how to make kolam. - Dude, do you want me to...? - Do you want to sponsor? No, right? So mind your business. Shall I attempt... to ask Chandra about this? I meant they are accustomed to handling wedding decorations for clients, so I'm sure they can make kolam too. I'm doing this for us! Looks like someone has their own hidden agenda. Then you make the call. My phone doesn't have enough credit. Don't you have the DiGi Campus plan? Do it! - I haven't switched to it yet. - Then do it. Dude, you go and ask her. - What a monkey! - I am the one! Why? Tell me, why? Has any girl ever helped us before? Hello. Chandra? It's me Suriyan. Tell me. I can see your name on my phone. Well, we have decided to make kolam for Independence Day on behalf of the Indian Club. So we wanted to know how to make it and how much it would cost. Since your family does wedding decorations... By the way, have you eaten? Okay. What size and design preferences do you have in mind for the project? Send it to me. I'll check and let you know, okay? Okay. Hey, should I come and hand it to you at your hostel? - I'm just nearby. - It's okay. - Send me through text. - Okay. - Hey! - Yes, what? Did you buy that juice? Oh. About that... Yes, I bought it. Crazy fellow. Bye. Sultana who keeps touching and talking! Okay. Well, she inquired about the design and size of the kolam and requested that we send her the details so she can provide a cost estimate. I knew she would definitely help us... So, our job has become much easier now. The proposal is ready. Once the design is ready, we'll give it to the professor. Yes. Guys... There is an advertisement for juice on television. "Taking three days off again this week?" Do you guys know about it? Well, looks like someone has their own hidden agenda again. Hey! It's an advertisement for women. Why do you care? It's nothing... Well, do they sell that juice in every shop? Why do you need it? Nothing... Chandra asked for it! Hey! Shut up. Hey. Did she really ask for it? And she asked you for it?! Hey, that's for their menses issue. But if she's asking it from you then... Tell me honestly... Did she say I love you to you? Hey, she simply... asked as a friend. Look at him blushing. Heart-stealer! Why would a girl tell all this to a guy who's just her friend? True. She could have asked me if she wanted, right? Or she could've asked Batman. What does it mean if she's asking you...? Dude, it's confirmed. You're going to buy that juice... - and give it to her. - Hey! He can't go! Let's go together to buy it! But you must be the first guy ever to propose your love to someone with that kind of juice. What do you want, "brother"? Brother! We are looking for... juice... Which juice, brother? Orange juice, brother? Apple juice, brother? Or rose syrup juice, brother? All the juices are on that side, brother. I know! We looked on that side but didn't find what we were looking for. Really, sir? Well... There is always an advertisement for juice on television. It goes like this, "Taking three days off again this week?" That one? On that side. It's on the top row of a shelf. Tell me something... How is it that she calls you "sir" and me "brother"? Maybe next time. You're going to buy the juice, give it to her tomorrow, and propose your love to her! He has switched off everything! Boy! Please make me some black tea. Boy! Mom. Why don't you ask her to make it, Mom? Hey, I just came back from work. Don't start this now! You took my money, didn't you? You have financial support for education. What do I have? I receive my salary at the end of the month. Are you paying the bills? Yes, I am. Hey, is it with the money you earn? You earn it and give it to me. So, I pay. Back then, you'd give me at least 50 cents when sending me to the shop. - It's not the same nowadays. - What's this? Sure. Take it! You took my money. Just take everything! I spat in that drink. How's it? Go. Malaysia! Taking three days off again this month? I had no choice. Now forget about this problem. Say "hi" to Yayari Juice and "bye" to three days off! Yayari Juice? Does it really work? Why don't you buy it and check for yourself? Why don't you ask your boy for some money? Boy, give me some money. He'll give you a lot of money. Mom, Aunt Rani gave us a bag. Where did you keep it? It's in your brother's cupboard. Go check. Why did you keep it in his cupboard? Oh, God! Hey! What? Hey! Move away! I need to take a bag out. I'll get it for you. Go. Why? What's inside? What are you hiding? I have that juice inside. Oh, really? As if you have it... You would never spend your money to buy something. Quick! Kolangal drama is starting soon, so bring it faster. It's so hard to hide something. Oh, God. KOLANGAL Kolangal! Kolangal! Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! What are you doing here? - Are you taking my money again? - No. There is a sale going on... Discount of 20 ringgit! So you're taking it in increments, bit by bit. Mom! Why did you shout and wake up? I don't know. There was this... a small boy. He came... and tried to wake me up. Doesn't he have any other work? But to wake you up? Wait, I'll come... - Go. - Get lost! I can't even peacefully steal in my own house. Damn it! How social media is bad for you? First is depression and anxiety. Hey! Scoot over to this side. - Number two... - Why? - Just come and sit. - is cyberbullying. Number three is FOMO. Fear of missing out. What? I just placed my bag. - Number four is very important. - When he kept it, you didn't say anything! Unrealistic expectation. - Do we have an exam today? - Number five... - Why are frontbenchers in the back? - is negative body image. Can you let me concentrate? Oh, yes! Class... I forgot to tell you one thing. Tomorrow... is a very important day. It's Eclipse Day. There will be an eclipse at 3:53 p.m. If possible, look at it through a film negative. Because it is not an everyday occurrence. Seize the moment! When I was a kid, my mother used to tell me the Moon and the Sun are very special. No one witnesses their love for each other except during the rainy season. During the rainy season, we can't see the Moon or the Sun. So that's why we can only see them loving each other during the day of the eclipse. As only on that day and that time we can see them together. So... seize the moment, guys. Seize the moment. - Dude, will we finish our assignment? - Yes. Like every year. We always finish it one day prior to the deadline. This is normal. She turned around and looked. Hey! He's looking back at her. Hey! It's like a poor man longing for an expensive car. I knew it the moment I saw your hairstyle that you would be a playboy. - Did you see him? - He managed to woo the girl. - I don't know. - Yes. Okay. Okay, bye. Okay, guys, tonight Thina's team is coming down. So tonight we'll have some drinks. Tomorrow, we're going up the hill to watch the eclipse. First, let me give this to her. - Show me. - Hey! Get lost. How are you going to give it? With the bottle? No, I want to try a new method. Alright, don't worry about anything, okay? Whenever we played FLAMES, - you always got marriage. - Really? So, be brave and give it to her. But give us a treat tonight. Only vegetarian, guys. Hey! Why vegetarian? It's Friday. I have to go to the temple tonight. - That's why. - So, you eat. Why me? Hey, tomorrow is the eclipse day. To witness it, we should follow a vegetarian diet - because during the eclipse... - What is he blabbering? That's what they taught me when I was a small kid. Have you seen those old movies where the trees move and - a guy dressed in red dances...? - Why are you dancing? Hey, I only asked for non-veg food. Why are you torturing me like this? - Hi! - I will get you... - Hi! Hi! - Bye! - Bye. - We will see you later. - Bye, Suriyan. - Bye, Suriyan. Okay... It's 53 meters. I have done it. If you want it longer, just multiply it. Thank you. So... don't I get anything for helping you? Here. What's this? It's that juice... Shit! Damn! You actually bought this?! I was just playing around! How am I supposed to bring this with me to class? Here, you keep it. You asked for it on the phone yesterday. I was just teasing you, you crazy fellow. Who would ask for stuff like this? Who did you say this was for when you bought it? I told them... It was for my girlfriend. My God! You briefly made me your girlfriend? Not briefly, Chandra. Wholeheartedly... What? It's been a while... since I have liked you. Since you first asked me to call you, I've liked you a lot. I intended to confess once our studies are over. Suriyan... Are you serious? After my mother... if there's anyone else I like, is you. Don't ask me why or how. I swear, I don't know. But I truly love you. All this while, I didn't want to tell you. But after you confided in me about the girl's problem, I resolved to confess. Shut up, Suriyan! Just because I talked to you about my period, does it mean I love you? What the hell! I mingled with you the same way I mingled with everyone else. You're just a friend to me, Suriyan. I like you very much, Suriyan. As a friend. Maybe... if you had shown some feelings to me since the beginning, I would have perceived things differently. But... Sorry, Suriyan. I don't have that kind of feelings for you. Will... you develop feelings at any point after this? I'm in love with someone else, Suriyan. If I truly love him... I won't have feelings for you. What am I to do with this juice? Suriyan... What are you expecting from me? Go. Give it to your mom... or your sister. They are women too. Yup. Bye, goodnight. See you. Hey! Have you not slept yet? You haven't changed... You still have your bag. Are you going away from home? Are you running away? What happened? Hey! Where did you get this from? I bought it for someone. But the person doesn't want it. Everyone has the right to say no, boy. I knew it when I saw you talking on the phone. Who is it? It's okay. She said she doesn't like me. Okay, just leave it. She doesn't deserve you. What do I do with this juice? Give it to Mom. If you're feeling down... wake up in the morning, and go out alone. Go to the temple, or just go out somewhere. After some time, you'll miss us torturing you. You'll miss Mom's smile. Then you'll come back home to us. Okay? Go on... Hey! What are you doing here? We've been looking for you! How many times do we have to call you? Luckily, your sister told us at your house. Alright, leave it. - It was our fault. - Hey! What was our fault?! Why does she need to chase after him in the first year? Even we thought they were a couple. She mingled with everyone the same way. Hey! I will curse you out! You were in the hostel throughout the first year. We noticed everything about you. The way you both mingled together. Talking on the phone every night. She requests numerous gifts, addresses you with affectionate names, asks for mobile recharge, and eventually breaks up with you! If we can't love our friends, should we love and marry elderly people? What kind of logic is that? A girl once said this to me. I treated her as a family member. Hey... My mom... and my sister have never done something like this. - Hey! - You... - Chill. It's okay. - He's pissing me off! I did everything for her. - I will curse you out! - Stop screaming! That's it! That was your mistake. If you had done something for your mom or sister, they would have felt proud and spoken highly of you. But you didn't! What to do! You were in love! Okay, just leave it. Hey! I don't care if I'm not vegetarian anymore. We're getting grilled fish and drinking sour plum juice! - Aren't we getting any alcohol? - The prices have gone up! - And I don't have money! - And he doesn't have money! Chill. Relax. Hey! You come with me! I'll take his bike. Come. It's okay. Hey! Shut up! Get him. - Poor guy. He's broken. - Aren't we going to see the eclipse? Hey... A lot has happened here. It's already 3:50 p.m. It's okay, come. - Come on. - Let's go. They'll love each other, call each other sweet names - and assume we're friends. - I've already said that! Get on the bike. Go there! I'm just going to take my helmet. Oh, God! If you had shown some feelings to me since the beginning, I would have perceived things differently. I'm in love with someone else, Suriyan. If I truly love him... I won't have feelings for you. Buy for me. Have you bought the juice? Give it to your mom or your sister. Hey! Oh, dear! Okay! Start the music! Release the smoke. Oh, my! He's looking. Stop the smoke. This is too much. There is too much smoke. The technician is very bad. Gosh, why is there so much smoke? These effects are a bit too much. Oh, what a nasty accident! The eyes have left the socket. Very good. Oh. His brains have popped out. Hi. Eyepad! Eye. Pad. It's new. But I've replaced it three times. It freezes all the time. Where's the leg? Oh, it's right here. - Where's his...? Oh, it's destroyed. - Bro... Am I dead? Technically, yes. You're supposed to get a full recap by now. Everything comes in flashbacks. Did it come? I haven't started living my life yet. Oh... - I need to look after my mom and sister. - Gosh... Well... There's nothing I can do about that. Anyway, I have no time. Listen... Look, speak correctly into the camera. - Your name is Jack Rajagopal. - Jack? What is your age? How did you get destroyed by this truck? Tell me everything in detail. Speed it up, and I'll move on to my next task. Look here. Look here and tell me. Smile. Jack is my friend! My name is Suriyan! Suriyan... He had a lifespan of 70 years? Oh, God... Did you recently change your name for numerological reasons? So you weren't riding the bike? I'll take his bike! Come! I knew his Friday prayers would save him from death. See, Suriyan... Not my mistake. It's the tab. It somehow froze. I clicked it correctly. Instead of taking the life of your friend, it took yours. It's all because of the eclipse. Who are you?! Who are you, blabbering for so long?! I'm actually... Well, I am Cupid, you know? Ex-Cupid. Do you know what a Cupid is? The one that shoots the arrow and makes people fall in love. That was my previous job. I made a small error, and now I'm working here. Doing all of this... Look, I joined just a year ago. Even my horns haven't fully grown yet. Please, I am sorry. Who are you?! Why should I believe what you just said? One minute... This feels very uneasy. Wait, let me change. Now, I feel free. I'll switch back later when the weather is better. Don't tell anyone. Actually... we're the ones who give and take lives. It's not literally us. It's the system. It laid out the plan for me. My luck, I got the broken tab. It caused all of this. I am very sorry. I have made two mistakes so far. If I make the third one, I will be punished by being born as a human being. I didn't intend to make these errors. Why, man? Why, man?! Actually, I'm not a male... or a female. In fact, I'm not a human being. We don't have a race. We don't have any sexual organs, either. I don't care! Give me my life back! I want my life back! See... Your lifespan is actually 70 years. I can do something if it's two or three years. But now I really can't do anything. Listen to me, Suriyan. It's better to live in the afterlife than to live here. The love, happiness, and everything here is all a lie. There is no agenda and lies in the afterlife. He's thinking too much. Oh, no! Ghora! Look here, Suriyan. In one and a half years, a foreigner is going to die here. Ghora is going to come and collect him. If Ghora finds out about my mistakes, it will report them to the department. Actually, I can help you with something. In fact, the help I'm providing will end up benefiting me in the process. Well, I can bring you to see your mom. People who die like this cannot enter their homes, but I can still bring you in. You just need to help me. What...? What help? Finally... he's on board!. Your lifespan actually ends in 70 years. Now you're 22 years old. So you still have 48 years to go. Pick a year from your past and another from the future, and I can grant them to you. It's not reality, but rather a dream-like existence you inhabit. It's like a bridge between the people who are dead and alive. You can also call it a different dimension. One year of the dream life is equal to twelve years of real life. So you have twelve years of the past and twelve years of the future. When you add it up, it's 24 years. You'll still have a balance of 24 years. Those years I'll transfer it to your mom, and you can live happily. Choose one year of the life you lived in the past. Choose another year of the life you wish to live in the future. You can go to any age in your life. Nobody gets this opportunity. You get one year from the past and one year from the future. You'll spend 24 years of your real life. During that time, you won't even remember that you are dead. But... I'll come and remind you 30 days before the end of your dream life. This is not how I'd look then. I'll look very different. Why is it like that? Dead people can live their lives as if it's real. But in their last 30 days, we will remind them. So if the dead people have any final words, they can use that time to convey their final words. The living will feel a connection as if the departed have delivered a message. That's the essence of it, and I'm offering you that chance. Please. Do me this one favor. Later, when Ghora comes, I'll lose my job. If it reports to the department, I'm finished for good. I'll have to be born as a human. Specify the age you desire, and I will transport you to that period of your past. But for one year. Is that okay? Why is the tab vibrating? Chandra... A girl's name in my tab? Weird. - Oh, is this the girl who betrayed you? - What name did you mention? Even in death, Chandra occupies your heart and soul. Was she that important in your life? If you had shown some feelings to me since the beginning, I would have perceived things differently. Will my wish... manifest in the life I've lived? Yes, whatever you imagine or wish for will come true. The year 2006. My first semester. I'm attending my university for the first time. Can you send me there? The year 2006. You were wearing jeans and a T-shirt and looking at the timetable, right? Look up a little. Hello, Alagamma. Boy? Is everything okay? Yes, everything's okay, Mom. - I'm looking at the class timetable. - Sister, continue the massage! - Wait a second! - I am noting it down. Boy? Your sister will pick me up. You head home straight after college. Okay, alright. - Bye. - Bye. You're always on the phone! Keep it away and do your job! I know how to do my job! Multimedia Designer. Studies, Social Studies... Excuse me, bro? May I know where is the social studies timetable? It's on the top, bro. Oh. If it's too high, change it to our convenience. It's not wrong. It's our money. My name is Jack, bro. Hey, Joker... He's a new student. He seems like a good boy. Hi, bro. Hi, bro. I tore and pasted it back together. Awesome, dude! Did you steal the timetable? It's not wrong, bro. It's our money. - Batman. - I am Batman. His name is Batmanathan, but we call him Batman. This is Joker. His name is Jokim. We call him Joker. They may fight a lot, but they never give up on each other. Your name, bro? - Suriyan. - Oh. Where are you... Where are you from? I'm from Selangor. How about you guys? We're from Johor. JDT! Oh. So, it looks like we'll be studying together. That's what our parents thought when they sent us here. - So are we not going to study? - Well... No one in history has achieved success solely through studying. Have you paid your fees? - Yes. - I don't have money, bro. Hey! Did you pay the fees upon arrival? - Yes, I paid. - That's what he's asking. Don't start right away. Let's go. You see, they are always like this. They always have something to fight about. Don't worry about it. Just see how we will study and achieve great success. You said we were absent for four days, - but she's claiming it was 14 days. - Why...? Why are you barking like a dog? She's lying! We are not the worst students. Who's attending the class? She or us? - Yes. - Yes. If the lecturer is that stubborn, imagine how stubborn we have to be as students. - Yeah, right! - Yes. Look at my jacket. I'm a good boy. Who bought the jacket for you? My ex, dude. I think the girl doesn't know much about him. Who's that? Why bother? Shut up! I'm nervous about what the lecturer's going to say. Bro, don't get tense. Suriyan, it's your job to talk to her and put us all in the same group for the assignment. Because she likes you the most. See how shy he is. Bro, let's go and eat nasi lemak. Hey! - I want to follow you guys too. - What about me? - You can come too. - Are you guys going to wait? We'll eat first. You can join us once you're done. Hey Batman, give the helmet to Joker afterward. - Why the girl isn't looking at us? - Shall I tell the girl I'm single? It's kinda hot on that side. My God. I need to change the university. Hi. Hi. Are you from this faculty? Yeah. But... late admission. I joined after completing my Diploma. But... I was unable to receive a complete credit transfer. That's why I'm here. What course? Social Studies. Social Studies? I'm from that course too. My God... Nice! So how are the classes? Everything is okay. Okay... Lecturers? Are they all okay? They are very friendly. How about Madam Azlina? She is very friendly, and I think it shouldn't be an issue in your case. Hey Suriya! How many times do you want to ask me to change the group? I can't be helping you guys all the time, okay? And you are? Madam... I am Chandra. I called you regarding my credit transfer. I've spoken to you about this before, right? Your courses don't quite meet our requirements. But I tell you what... You can join the classes for now, and then you see how you can adjust it. - Suriya! - Yes, madam. You can work with her on this. Okay? Alright. Thank you. You said she is friendly. No. She cares about me. Sometimes she cares too much, nothing else. Okay... What... subject does she teach? First, tell me your name. I've already told you. Sorry, I don't eavesdrop on people's conversations. Oh, I see. My name is on the cover of your book. Book... Stephanie Meyer? Chandra. Moon. Hi, Moon. I am Sun. Suriyan. I know. I eavesdropped. I feel bad eating without him. Let's bring him along. He's our friend. Hey! I thought he was the only one who wasn't interested. Hey... Why the long face? Nothing. I wanted to woo the girl. Is this why you wanted to come back here after we went halfway? You quashed my excitement about her. Now look who outpaced me. Okay, let's go. Let's walk back in reverse. The love story ended five minutes ago! Come on. HELLO! HAVE YOU EATEN? YES! HOW ABOUT YOU? - I AM HAVING FRIED RICE WITH CHILLED MILO. - ARE YOU FULL? - NOT REALLY. - OH, OKAY! Do you have a girlfriend? Yeah, I do. Oh... You didn't mention it before. It's just that... she's older than me. Is it okay for you to love a woman older than you? - Okay. - Her name is Alagamma. She's my mother. Oh, God! It's like watching a classic Tamil movie, dear. Dear? You don't want me to call you that? - Not that... - You don't want me to? It sounds new to me. So, you don't want me to? I didn't say that, dear. Oh. Dear? You don't want me to? Should I say that? Yeah. I'll call you tonight. I'll tell you. Chandra! Do you listen to Malaysian songs? A little bit. You'll listen to it more after this. Chandra? Chandra? Chandra? Suriyan... Chandra? Who is it? Who is it? Hey! Who is that? Hey! Come on out! Pick a year from your past and another from the future, and I can grant them to you. Suriyan! We were with you. Suriyan? What happened? Why are you crying? Tell me, what happened? Tell me! What...? Suriyan! That's not important now. It's okay! Should I say that? Please tell me what happened?! Suriyan! Suriyan! I can't take it! Don't remind me of it! Living a life, being aware of my own death is torture. That's the life of a human. A life with no use at all. That's why I vowed not to be born as a human. All the love and other feelings are just lies. Please, let me go! Let you go? Please, let me go! I can't do that. If Ghora comes, it'll destroy my life. Do you know that? If that's the case, then next time, you can choose to end your life if you wish to avoid being reminded. After all, it's just a dream life. Please let me go, Bonu! Please, Bonu. Just let me go! Furthermore, this time you are not going backward but forward. The future! Even then, you won't let me be with my mom. Since it's the future, I'm not sure if your mom will be there or not. That's because it's your future. Is Chandra there in my future? It's your life... Your dream... If you want her to be... then she'll be there. Otherwise, she won't. I can't tell you all that. However, you are free to go to the age of your choosing. Simply leave me in any year, Bonu. I'll live my remaining one year and come back. Does the age of 34 sound good? This is your favorite age. You'll live alone. Let me just live alone and come back. Just one thing... If you think of her, she'll be there. But don't complain if she dumps you again. Okay, 34 years old. You're riding in a train. Please, get up. Get up! Bro? Wake up, bro. Don't you always get off at this station? The boy has come home! I am really fed up! See! The guy is back already. Oh, God! He's back! This year, astronomers have announced that the Lunar Eclipse on December 26th is a rare occurrence after several years. It only happens once every 100 years, according to them. A once-in 400-year solar spectacle... SISTER - Yeah, tell me. - Hey. Are you in Johor Bahru? Yes, why? I'm at the JB bus stop. What are you doing there? Hello? Hello! Now, I'm... I'll wait at the bus stop. Can you come for a while? Looks like there's a problem! I'll be there! Are you here just to cry? Your husband is upset. You should have thought it through before coming. He always keeps on mentioning Nisha. She's texting him every night. Should I call and talk to him? No need. - Let me call him. - He claims she's just a friend. He says that I'm doubting him. Let him be happy with her. Ask him to give me my daughter. Avoid making any hasty decisions! Think about your daughter's life. Hello, Brother-in-law. Yes, boy? Is your sister with you? Yes, she's here. What's the issue between both of you? It's your sister. She's imagining things and unnecessarily doubting me. Why would I go looking for another woman? Isn't one marriage enough to struggle with? And you expect me to find another one? She says you're texting Nisha every night. Oh, God! For stock checks, I can only communicate with the night shift staff. Your sister didn't want me to work at night. How can she be like this, boy? After getting married and having a child, would anyone do something like this? Tell me, boy. Boy! Just tell her one thing... I fell for her beauty, married her, and now I'm struggling. Am I that dumb to repeat it? I won't repeat the same mistake twice. Understand? Understood, Brother-in-law. I'll send her off by bus shortly. Oh, God. This is what happens when you believe a woman. Tell me, was it a mistake to marry you off to someone who lives nearby? You always flee like this after a minor argument. If my presence bothers you, I won't come. This is what you said the last time. Okay... I'm planning to bring Mom to JB. Did she agree to come? If you ask her politely, she'll agree to come. If you're always yelling at her, she wouldn't agree. Come, I'll see you off to the bus. What do you mean by seeing me off? Come and stay with us for a day. I can't. Batman is returning from Congo tomorrow after two years. Tomorrow is his birthday, and he has invited me to the temple. Let's go. Why? He won't spend his birthday with his wife? Dude, is your business going well in Congo? Not that much. Just a little. - It's running by God's grace. - He's here. - The Congo girl... - My friend! What is this beard? Stay away. It terrifies me to be near it. - Two years in Congo. - Hey! Will you be late for the temple too? You're fortunate to be nearby. I have to come from JB town. Okay... Just come. I wonder what oil he uses for his beard. Come... Dude, please shave your beard. We can't even tell if it's you or someone else. Do you have birds nesting inside it? Hey! I'll laugh at your illogical joke later. Now pray. State your names. Batman... Batmanathan. Born under Uttara Nakshatra in Capricorn. Batmanathan. Born under Uttara Nakshatra in Capricorn. Namdeshiya. Over there. Dude, when he brings the tray, can you put some money? I'm short on cash. Hey! When will you ever learn? Hey, God! Tell me something... Why did you all come here if you're just going to stare at your phones? Dude... You know Instagram, don't you? We need to update periodically to show we're alive. That's true. In the past, we only needed to notify if someone passed away. Nowadays, we have to inform people that we're alive. So, how's work in Singapore? It's okay. Be glad you got the tutoring job recommended by the college dean who visited the exhibition. So, nobody's going to put away their phones?! Okay! Hey! Put your phones down. - Remember the bangles I bought...? - Whoever touches their phone first, has to pay for the fuel and toll. I don't have money right now, dude! One Suriyan is looking at another Suriyan. When Suriyan sets, Chandra rises. I meant the Moon. As Chandra sets, Suriyan promptly emerges. It's the ultimate truth of life, isn't it? What's ultimate about it? Dude, everything has to be in its place. When Chandra sets, Suriyan rises the next morning, owing to the Earth's orbital movement. Hey! What are you doing? Eclipse. It seems like he's showing us the Sun and the Moon together. Dude! Our heart is like the turning Earth, always in motion. It concerns itself with words spoken about us and the repetition of life events. It's like that. It carries numerous questions. It's the ultimate truth of life, dude. Dude, if we learn to appreciate everything in life, it becomes beautiful. Just like Professor Mayilvaganam used to say, - Seize the moment. - Seize the moment. It's somehow true. Every second is precious like gold. If we have the intention to enjoy life, our life will be happy. Hey Suriya, value and enjoy your life. Enough of being this way. You and your beard... Hey! Hey! Chandra is no more in your life. You have to accept it. Try to move on in your life. Okay. When are you bringing your mom over? She will be here next week. Good. It's great that she is coming over. You will have all your happiness in your life. More importantly, - you will change too. - Yeah. Do you still have all her paintings? Hey! That's okay. It's just memories. As long as it doesn't influence you. That's all. Hey! We are all married. When is your turn? You're 34 years old now. Damn it, guys. Do I have to get married just because you all did? Of course. You have to experience what we are experiencing. - True. - Try to lie once, dude. Just once. You can witness the emergence of famous detective traits within them. What do you think I was doing just now? I was texting my wife. Even if it's a tiny lie, she will somehow sniff the truth out of me. It's the same with me. I lied to my wife by saying I would go to the beach tomorrow but came here instead. Fine. I'll get married too. What's this? Whose is it? Hey! I don't know, man. It's a miracle. Hey! What is this in your hand? How do you have your phone in your hand? Hey! I don't have money! How did you style your hair without money? Hey, wait up! Moon. Suriyan? Sorry, sorry, sorry... Hello? Hey, Jack. Hello? Hey! - What is it? - It's Chandra! What are you doing? It's Chandra! - Hey! What are you doing? - Chandra is in the opposite house! I can't hear anything. Boss! You dropped your ID card. - Hey! - What? Why haven't they demolished the building yet? It was old, even during my grandfather's time. Tell me something... Do all the writers and painters grow a beard and live in places like this? Even you wore weird outfits after coming back from Congo. - Come on. - Don't you dare talk about Congo! Tell me... Why is he living in a place like this? Hey! Come in and look for yourself. Don't judge the book by its cover. It would make more sense if Joker lived here. Okay, did you eat a monkey's brain in Congo? As your tummy looks so bloated. Don't you dare speak of Congo again! Hey! Hey! Is this the same four-year-old padlock? He didn't lock it. He just hung it and stayed inside. Today, the padlock gains its independence after he's had it for so long. Get ready to witness the gate's magic! Hey. Hey... What is that sound? The police from another street might come over if they hear this noise, thinking there's a problem. Why does he even need the padlock? Hey, open the door. Suriyan, open the door. What is he up to behind the closed door? He's probably done by now and washing his hands. I meant he's probably done painting and washing his hands now. - Say that clearly. - Hey! In Congo, it means something else. Why? What does it mean in Congo? Chandra... Batman! Jack? What happened, Batman? You look so different now. Chandra... How are you? I'm fine, Jack. How are you guys? - When did you come here? - Mom, come here. Yes, coming. Is that your son? Yes, my only son. Tamil. He's your son, so he must be a Tamil boy. No, I meant, his name is Tamil. Well... will you guys be here? No... how do I tell you...? Now... I know. I saw. For how much longer must I gaze at the ground? Okay. I'll catch you guys later. Hey! Have you been hiding behind the door all this while? - Come inside! - She's saying... Hey! My shirt! It's expensive! Wow. How come she's here? Hey! Is this why you called yesterday? I'm really sorry. I swear I couldn't hear you. I called you back, but you didn't answer. Dude, - your house is so beautiful. - Shut up! I'll whack you! What am I supposed to do now? What disgusting outfit are you wearing? Congo silk. Hey! Isn't this Chandra? So the culprit is nowhere else but here... Hey! I'm talking to you! She's now married and has a child. Crazy fellow. Just stay with your mom and mind your own business. She'll mind her own business. Understand? Do you understand?! Hey! Why are you barking like a dog? If she speaks to you, simply respond. Don't run and hide. How long are you going to keep running away? She just rejected you. She didn't hate you. Okay? Don't assume she hates you. I'm talking to you! - Why are you staring outside? - He's been like that since then! You scolded me, and now you're screaming! Mom? Mom... Mom! Alagamma! Why is it so quiet? Are you watching TV? Are you watching Azhagi? You should have left the door open. Alagamma? Mom! Mom? Alagamma. Are you asleep? Wake up! Alagamma? Mom? Mom? Wake up, Mom! Mom... Mom? Mom? Mom? Hypoglycemia. Low blood sugar. Does she eat on time? She claims she eats on time. She claims? Why? Aren't you with her? Doctor, I actually came to take her home with me. Diabetic patients have to take their meals on time. She must never skip her meals. She needs to drink more water. Okay? She shouldn't walk long distances. Mom? Mom? When did you lose your vision? When I was 28 years old, doctor. After giving birth, my eyesight gradually diminished. I'm on medication since then. Okay. Make sure you eat on time. Be happy. Okay? Health is very important. - Take care of your mother. - Okay, doctor. Doctor, did you smoke a cigarette? The smell is very strong. -If you smoke yourself, -Mom... - how will you save other people? - Mom! Stay quiet! Sorry, doctor. She's always like that. No worries. Mom! It felt like I got slapped. I'll stop smoking cigarettes, okay? Promise. You may take her and go. He's near death. How can he save others? Mom, wait here for a moment. Boy? Is my lipstick nice? - It's nice, Mom. - Okay. How about my eyeliner? That's the only thing lacking now! Hey! Open the door quickly! Stay quiet, Mom! Actually... Everyone must be asleep. It'll be very loud... Can we come back here tomorrow morning? Today... we can stay at the hotel. - What? Are you nuts? - Mom! - I said, open the door! - Okay... - Okay... - Why would I stay in a hotel? Boy? - Do you have a lot of money in the house? - Come, Mom. - Alagamma! Come in. - I said, open the door! Come in. - It's so hard to climb up the stairs. - Don't shout, Mom. And he's not opening the door. Very noisy! Hey Tamil. Who are you talking to? Mom! How are you, Suriyan? - Mom! - Son, wait. - Sorry. The gate is very noisy. - Son... - No, it's okay. - Mom! You wanted me to hurry inside due to the noise. - Now, who are you talking to out there? - I am coming, Mom. - Is your mom here? - Mom! Mom! - Mom, let's go inside. - She'll live here from now on. Wait. - May I come? - Please, Mom. - Please, let's go inside. - Son, wait. - Wait... - Well... probably not tonight. - Maybe... - Wait, Son. tomorrow morning? - I'm working tomorrow. - Mom! Then after work... After work, perhaps. Okay. Mom, it's enough! Bye! Hey! Say sorry to him. No. It's alright. - He's talking well. - Sorry! Mom, come inside. So sorry. I'll see you. Bye. Mom, don't talk to him. Mom, it's so noisy! Is she your neighbor? Tell me. Alagamma. Don't you ever stop? If it has not begun, let me help you in initiating it. The girl has a very nice voice. You go and get some sleep. Boy... I don't feel sleepy. Can you do me a favor? Please play Chandrakumari on the phone for me. I'll listen to it and fall asleep. Alagamma, you've been indulging in TV dramas too much lately. Not one much or too much! Give it to me! Careful, Son. Mom, I'm very sleepy. Morning! Morning! You're going to Singapore, right? Yeah. - How do you know? - Mom... - I know. - I am very sleepy, Mom. That day... I saw you near Buffalo Route. You were going somewhere with a file. Actually... I thought I saw you too. I searched, but you were gone. I am sleepy, Mom. My office is right there. So, I went to work. - Will you bring him along? - Come on. Enough, Mom. Chandra, - I asked you something just now. - What was it? Will you bring him to work too? Oh, no. My friend has a daycare. I'll leave him there. She's the one who recommended me a job. So, it's easy with the daycare. Come. Be careful and watch your step. - Mom, I am sleepy... - Sleepy? Alright. - What about your husband? - Taxi! Okay. - See you tonight, okay? - Yes. Son, say bye to him. - Bye. - Bye, uncle. So far, the husband is not at home. Maybe she's divorced. We can't make assumptions. Why? Why didn't you ask? She was about to get in a taxi, dude. It's okay. That's her life. Hey! Listen carefully. That's... her life. You just focus on your life. So, what's your mom saying? As soon as she arrived, she began. According to her, the house is dusty and in need of sweeping and window cleaning. I asked her to rest and came here. I wonder what Alagamma's doing since morning. I don't understand why they smoke cigarettes! They're definitely going to die! It's likely the young ones. The older ones won't do it. No brains at all! - Sorry, sorry, sorry... - No! Your mom invited me. That's why I am here. No. It's alright. I'll close the door. Go that way. Careful. Don't trip yourself. Boy! How's the house? Hi, Mom. I asked you to rest, didn't I? No! She was resting. We began conversing as soon as I opened my house gate. As a result, we ended up cleaning the house together. - Hi, uncle. - Hi. Uncle, you are good at drawing. I love drawing. Me too. Can you teach me? Boy! Make some black tea. Aunty, let me make it. No, it's alright. I'll make it. - It's okay, I'll make it. - No... How about both of you make it together? It will be nice. It has begun. Sorry. No, I just feel like I'm troubling you. Just chill. Mom is talking so well. The absence of her eyesight is never a disadvantage whatsoever. In fact, she can see you perfectly, despite her lack of eyesight. What is your husband doing, Chandra? He's a very nice man. He loves me so much. I met him during our second year of university. One day, I saw him at our family function. He's an engineer. We got married in 2012. When I lived with him, I never missed my own family. In 2014... he received a work call. He had to leave for Beijing, China. He left... and never came back. The plane that left for Beijing... went missing. I was pregnant. I didn't know if I should be happy about the baby that is going to be born or... be sad that my husband is missing. I thought excessively, and time went by. If he's somewhere... alive. I'd be very happy. Tamil tends to believe everything we say. In your mom's tea... should I add milk? Black tea. You're cute. I could nibble you. I'll bite your cheek. I will bite you. Hey! Be quiet. Come here. Yes, uncle? What would you like to draw? Uncle, come closer. I want to draw my mother. You can. But... for that, you must always wear a smile. Tamil. Come, let's go. Chandra... if you don't mind, my mom is alone here, so maybe when you go to work, you can leave Tamil to stay here with my mom. Mom. Grandma is very lovely. It's true. I can keep myself busy too. Don't worry about my eyesight. I'll take really good care of him. You can both go to work happily. Boy... Do you feel anything? What is it, Mom? Feel what? Are you hiding something from me? What do I have to hide from you, Mom? When I was cleaning the house, I found a few cigarette packets. It wasn't smoked, just crumpled. Did you ever have the urge to smoke? No, Mom. It probably belongs to my friends who come to my house. Boy... I know your friends Batman, Jack, and Joker very well, and I'm aware that they don't smoke. I don't understand why you don't smoke it. But thank you for not smoking it. Mom, why are you thanking me? Don't chew my brains, Alagamma. Your dad took care of me very well in every way possible. The only bad habit he had was smoking cigarettes. He lost his life to it too. I love him so much. Even in his absence, I offer you the boundless love I have for him. Please, don't smoke. Alagamma... Don't worry. I won't ever smoke. I won't do that again. Okay? Did you give that girl some juice? - Did she tell you? - Yes, she did. But she didn't mention which juice it was. She said you gave it to her when you guys were studying. It was bael juice, Mom. She had some health issues back then. That's why I got her the juice. You never bought it for me! You have been very healthy and didn't have any health issues. You see... the juice was for unhealthy people. Alright... it's going to rain. Come on. Why don't you go and stand outside, boy? Something might happen. First, you go to bed. Come on. Can't sleep? Nope. I'm not sleepy. Why aren't you asleep? I was eavesdropping on a conversation between a mother and a son. You still didn't leave that habit? Nope. I also eavesdropped the other day. What was it? The day when Jack was here. You told him your son's name was Tamil. So, now we're even. Why didn't you get married? What? Marriage. Why didn't you get married? I will. Let's see. Did you purchase "that" juice... for any other girls? Every time I see that juice it reminds me of you. Oh, really? The advertisement is always on TV. Alright then. I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight. Hey! I don't want it! Hey! Shut up! Today we've decided to give you a romantic look. Imagine having the king of birds nestled in your beard. Hey! But why now? Why should I shave my beard just because you guys lack it? Hey, you shut up. Drag him into the barbershop! Everyone has a beard on their face, but you have a face in your beard. Come! You carry on. I'll be outside. Ask for a lawn mower for his beard. I don't have any money, guys! Did you know that in Congo, there's a shop for hair curling? Dude, did you bring any money? Hey! When will you ever learn? Don't you bring money when you go out? How will you eat? - Look how handsome he is looking. - Dude, success! Were you hiding this beautiful face in a cave all this time? Hey, your hair would look better with a slight drop in the front. - It's the Congo style. - You're always going on about Congo! First, we need to find out what he was doing in Congo. He probably took care of the monkeys there. He ate monkey brains over there! Hey! Isn't that our professor, Mayilvaganam? - Hey! It is him! - He looks better than him. Hey! It's him! Sir? - Sir! - Sir! Sir... Sir... Hey. - I remember you guys. - Good, sir. What's all this, sir? What happened, sir? Nothing happened. Sir! You're in a wheelchair, and you say nothing has happened. Hey... You guys were the ones who asked... why is your name Mayilvaganam? You guys asked me, where are Mayil, the peacock, and Vaganam, the vehicle? There you go... Here is Mayil, and this is Vaganam. Mayilvaganam. Why are you laughing, sir? Seize the moment! Whatever I said before, I'll say the same now. In our life, every moment that goes never comes back. My one hand was paralyzed back then. Now, half my body is paralyzed. So what? The other side is still good! Where are you staying now, sir? I am traveling the world with my wife. We are collecting memories. Hi dear, shall we go now? Dudes... My dudes! These are my dudes. - Hi! - Batman! Bye... - Sir, take care. - Bye, Suriya. - Bye, Batman. - Sir, let me help you. - Batman! - Sir? When is your new movie releasing? Well, sir... I have a sore throat. I need to change the director. Regretting after death... is futile. While you're alive... live to your fullest. If you like Chandra, tell her. Uncle? Hey, kiddo. Come here. What do you have in your hand? Drawings. Drawings? Is this my mom? This is not your mom. It is someone who looks like your mom. I knew her back then, so I drew her... Grandma said you know my mom. Alagamma... She blabbers a lot. Don't overthink it. Okay? Do you like my mom? A lot. Your mom is a very nice person. Uncle, can I take these? Keep them safe, okay? I didn't want to come. But I had to. I am sorry. Tomorrow is the eclipse. I woke you up today because I was afraid something might go wrong with the system again. You can end it here if you want to. There are just 30 days remaining. These are merely two and a half days of our lives. Send me back. Suriyan. There is not much for you there. If you go back once more, you'll feel only pain. It's pointless to have regrets after we die. Let me live as much as I can. Whether it's a dream or reality... I like it very much. I want to live on my own terms. In the remaining 30 days, I want to live happily. Let it be painful. It's okay. Instead of dying while imagining myself not doing what I want, I'd be better off doing what I love and dying. Why do you care? Do you want me to regret not living my life? Is that what you want? Am I right? So that your work can be completed smoothly. This is a dream world that reflects the real world, right? It's okay. I'll live in it. Uncle? Uncle, what happened? Uncle, why are you crying? Keep this. Uncle, why are you crying? Nothing. There is not much for you there. If you go back once more, you'll feel only pain. Boy, you didn't go to work? It's Saturday today. I like Chandra, Mom. Yes! I thought all the effort would be wasted. Not bad. She's a nice girl. But first, go and tell her. If she's interested, great. If not, I've also talked to a girl upstairs. How's my idea? Would you feel regretful if I'm gone? If you're around, I'll be happy and alive. As for the eclipse happening tomorrow, Malaysians can watch it from 11:20 a.m. to 3:11 p.m. The full eclipse will be visible at 1:14 p.m. Tamil. See who is it? Mom, uncle is here. Hey. You look different. Ensure your colored pencils are stored neatly and organized. How are you? We just met this morning. I'm fine. Would you like something to drink? Son, bring some juice from the fridge. It's okay. There will be an eclipse tomorrow, it seems. This time would be really special. The Moon will be very far from Earth. Son, where did you keep your toys? The Moon and Sun will be near each other. Do you want to go and see it? Of course. - Mom! - Tamil? - Mom, come here. - Tamil? - Tamil, where are you? - Mom! Okay, okay, okay. We don't have candles at home. What happened? Nothing... This happens. When we turn on the main power, it'll be okay. I will also switch on the main power in my house. Mom will be asleep. Tamil has slept. He showed me the drawings. I like you, Chandra. A lot. I don't know why. But I can't forget you. Have you ever experienced the inability to live for the person you love? If I hadn't told you that day, it would have been more painful. I'm uncertain whether I should be glad for telling you or cry because I couldn't be with you till the end, Chandra. On that day, you asked me... if I would develop feelings for you. I didn't answer that question, do you remember? Now I'm unsure if I should hold onto the belief that he will come back or accept the reality that he won't and move on, Suriyan. I have feelings for you, Suriyan. If I continue to live, I want to spend my life with you. Together. I don't know how long I'll live. It's best to live without that knowledge. Every moment I have, I want to make the most of every moment, Suriyan. Will you be the father of my child, Suriyan? DAD MOM ME When the Sun sets tomorrow, you will disappear too. What happened? A beautiful dream. After I woke up, I found out... It was just a dream. Dreams are also real... If we believe in them. Not all dreams end. It still continues in the dream world. We're the ones who wake up from it. That's all. It stays alive in the dream world. What would you do if I'm no more? I would cry. What else can I do? I have to live through it. What happened? All the love I have for you, I'll pour it on my son. I offer you the boundless love I have for him. I'm heading to the school to enroll in Tamil as a student. Would you like to join me? You take him and go. I need to... get something done. If you're reading this, then the dream is unfolding as I hoped. It'll continue, and you will definitely read it. Until now, my heart has earnestly desired for all of this to be real. When you said dreams are true, I began to believe. My love for you was true, Chandra. During our college days, you were the only one, after my mom, who had a claim on me. Only you. Just when I wondered if I could love you any more than this, Tamil entered my life. Tamil, my son. The thought of parting ways with both of you... makes me long to plead with God to stop me from going. I know you will bestow upon Tamil all the love you have for me and raise him. However, I wonder where I can express my love. Please send my regards to everyone. Especially... to those who have witnessed every aspect of my life, the ones who never gave up on me, my friends. True friendship brings beauty to life. Chandra... I am forever yours. I'll always be with you. You proved me wrong by living the love I thought never existed. If you had lived your life happily, everything would have changed. Ultimately, you arrived without having seen your mom's face. I need to complete my remaining 24 years, right? You promised to take me... to where I want to go if I finish them. Take me home. Back to the time when I died, and they mourned for me. After your death, she never cried... because she wasn't home. Your sister... left her here and went away. Boy? Are you back? You claimed that true love doesn't exist. Yet, right in front of us sits the embodiment of pure love. I know... Mothers exemplify the true essence of pure love, Bonu. I always knew... that you will never leave me alone. You will always be with me. I didn't even place a garland on your photo. I have been sitting here. Do you remember the last gift you bought for me? It is some kind of juice. I don't even know what it is. I didn't drink it. What if it finishes? My son bought it for me. Can you do me a favor? She won't survive without me. Once her life comes to an end, I will come with her. Please do it for me. While... you were living your dream life, I received some news. Similar to how the eclipse took your life span when you died, it also... altered your mother's life span. She will only live for two more years. You have two years to spend living with your mother. These are not tears. We don't have tears. It's his blessing. You can talk to your mother through other people. When you informed me that I couldn't live as a human, I promptly admitted my mistake to my superior. However, I've made three mistakes. Now, I have to be reborn as a human again. I'm not sure if I'll be born as a twin or a triplet... or to whom I'll be born. If you receive news about babies being born, just know it is me. You should have lived. I made a mistake. Moving forward, dedicate every moment of your life... to your mother... and your love. Live joyfully, and return. You shouldn't have died. Mom! Can you hear me? Boy? Boy? Are you talking to me? Yes, Mom! it's me! Can you hear me? I think something's wrong with my phone. You can talk to your mother through other people. Make the most of your life while you have it, as we cannot predict when it will end. The love, affection and care you invest in your life are everlasting. They extend to your partner, who later becomes your spouse, and then a mother, carrying on to the next generation. Live happily. After a lovely song, we bring you some exciting news. Angelina Jolie has welcomed twin babies into the world. Holy God!
