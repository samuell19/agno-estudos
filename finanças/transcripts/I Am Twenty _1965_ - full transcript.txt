Part Two You're acting foolishly, Kolia. You don't value your free time. - What has less calories? - Take a salad. Munching some popular pulp, books for reading in the subway. You should get more serious. Are you on a diet? Trying to eat healthy. Had a good holiday? Yes, thank you. Kolia, give me a sandwich. - There you go. - Thanks. - Hi,Valya. - Hi. Please. - How was your holiday? - Good. I saw you on television, at the demonstration. People must know their heroes. The time we live in! Watching demonstrations on TV like soccer. I guess you drank to that, too? - We did, but only to our plant. - Exactly. Valya, don't be angry. I'm not angry. Why should I be? Vladimir Vasilyevich, will you have a talk with them today? - Yes, I will. - I'd like to give you some advice. Avoid too much talking and commenting. The point is to teach them the ropes. Be wary of explaining commonplaces. Why are you eating just sandwiches? You don't take good care of yourself. - We live for our work. - Right, only for work. I couldn't, you know. Something came up. But you promised, we were waiting for you. Everything changed on the go. You got a record player, didn't you? That's not the point. My guys are just listening, with no questions asked. With you, It's different. What if they have questions? It's all right as long as they're not stupid questions. Sometimes if someone gets bored, he raises his hand. People are interested in talking as equals and asking questions when they believe what you're saying. Mankind spends half the time on clarifying their relationships. Enough, I'm fed up with it. Can't you understand that people began asking questions? Do you always know what he thinks about when he's asking? - About what he's asking. - You're no strategist. I'm just a second lieutenant, and that was long ago, too. Well, how about it, Valya? Well, that can't be helped. - I got a confidential question. - How much? - Five rubles. - Will it do? Do you have a handbook for college applicants? I'll return it on pay day. Thank you very much. Isn't it too late to study? So at 8:30? At 9 then, okay? Okay. Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye, comrade Pyoryshkin, comrade Kiselyov, comrade history, chemistry. Goodbye, my notebooks. Mommy, I'll be late. - Stand still. - Everything's all right. You should apply for the Energy Institute together with me. You'll be prompting me at examinations. Count only on yourself. I've got my own road in life. Mommy, that's it. There we go. You see? I'm coming! Coming! Coming! Mom, I think this clock should have gone to a museum long ago. - What? - My greetings and congratulations! It's so difficult to love a princess. It's such an agonizing process! A hand in a hand, a life in a life. That's love's eternal decree. And I will always come to you. You have to just call me. Go to bed now. Why are you still reading? Come on, it's late already. Sciences nurture youths. But not enough. Equals the mass per unit of volume. Damn, I forgot it all. Go to bed. Mom. Are you sleeping, Mom? Yes, I am. Go to bed, too. Seryozha Seryozha All right. Past one o'clock. You must have gone to bed Or maybe you're having this as I am, too I'm in no hurry with lightning telegrams I have no cause to wake or trouble you She loves me? Not? I twist my arms like crazy and having broken my fingers fling them away It's thus the petals of first-found daisies are plucked and guessed on and sent off in May Behold, my love, what hush has fallen on the ground The night has given starry due to the sky high and spacious At times as these you rise and speak aloud to ages, histories and all creation What hush in the world... What hush in the world... Past one o'clock, you must have gone to bed The Milky Way streams silver the night through I'm in no hurry, with lightning telegrams I have no cause to wake or trouble you With lightning telegrams... With lightning telegrams... With lightning telegrams... With lightning telegrams... Today is June 22! The day of our coming of age! The bottle will go round the Earth and return to Moscow! It'll get into the Volga, and the Volga flows into the Caspian Sea, which is drying up. It'll get into the Black Sea, and then on into the ocean! What time is it? What works at the Young Artists Exhibition did you like best? I liked Oleg Komov's sculpture "A Coed's Departure" and Tatyana Ivanitskaya's drawings. Thank you. We continue reporting from the Exhibition of Young Artists. The old halls of the Pushkin Museum grew young again... - Hi. - How's the exhibition? The joy of Peredvizhniki. Who is he?

My span grows short, I need no warning... - But. - But for my life to go on... And mine? I must be certain in the morning... - Of what? - That I will see you... - Me? - That very day and before long. And that evening, too? - That evening for sure. - And tomorrow. - And after tomorrow, and in a year. - And in a thousand years... And in two thousand years, and in 15 thousand. At least like this. Yes, at least like this. Hello. May I come along with you? I fell behind my group. Come on. This is Sergey. - I'm Oleg. - Sergey. - How is the exhibition? - The joy of Peredvizhniki. Ivan the Terrible Kills His Son. By the way, your parents are here. It'll be nice meeting your close ones. - How are you doing? - Just fine. And you? Just like before. - Did you travel anywhere? - To Stockholm. With soccer players? No. This time, with ichthyologists. Pay special attention to this man. He's extremely educated. He knows three languages. - Two. - You can learn one more in a jiffy. - He was in Guinea. - In Ghana. - He played badminton with... - Yes, I did. I did. His bride is a television announcer. - I think it's quite enough... - Enough for dying of jealousy. Attention! My parents are coming. Will you say hello? No. Give me a call sometime, the number's the same. - Bye. - Goodbye. Who's that guy? He's an interpreter, and he happens to be my husband. What? My husband. How come? We haven't yet started divorce proceedings. - I had no idea that you... - I guessed that much. And why are you divorcing? He's just a complete idiot. Well, I wasn't lucky, that's all. But all this is just the beginning. You have not seen my parents. They have me terribly fond of painting. And dad also loves cut the ribbon at all exhibitions. - Dad, I philanthropist. - Yes, numismatist. - Bachelor. - Antique dealer. Anna! Come here. I can not, you go. I can not! - What do I tell them? - I do not know, think of something. Tell him I'm going home. What I do not return at all. Well, what do you invent ?! What nonsense? Nevermind. Go. - Good evening, grannies. - Good evening, sonny. Seryoga. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm going with you. - Why? Let's take a stroll, drop at the movies? I can't, Kolia. I got to run. Can you lend me a fiver? Let me see. - That's all I've got. - Is that all? Maybe we'll ask your tenant? Does he pay you anything at all? No chance, he's sent his whole salary to his wife. What shall I do? Maybe Lucia will lend it? Since Slavka moved in with me, she's been pretending she doesn't know me. Lucia! Lucia! Lucia! Hi. Hi. Happy marriage. Thanks. Lend us a fiver. Let's see. Slava, how is it? C'est ci bon. Look closely at this door. It's just closed behind our comrade. Let's bare our heads. All right, I'm off. I'm already 10 minutes late. Take care! Come in. Oh God, just look at that! When will be the end of this? How are you doing? Don't worry, lady. Everything will be tip-top. Wait a second, I'll change. Hello. Hello. Oh, you're home. This is Sergey. And this is my dad, naturally. Good to meet you. - Sergey. - Her dad. We got to go. We've just met and you're already going. This is not very... How about a drink to our meeting? - I've heard so much about you. - Really? At least I know that your name is Sergey. And knowing my daughter,, this is a lot of information. You're in the mood today. C'mon turn around. I haven't seen you for so long. This thing becomes you. C'mon take a bite. We've learned how to drink, but not know how to eat after it. - I have bad newsfor you. - What? We'll see each other even less from now on. Why? I'll leave home soon. Yes, yes, I happened to hear something about that. Your mother shared this news with someone over the phone. So it's true? It's true. - The two of you decided so? - Yes, the two of us. And where're you going to live? We're looking for a room. You got the money? Yes, I'm working. - Have you ever rented a room? - No. And she has, but it was I who paid for it. Of course, the money is not the matter. But all this doesn't look solid enough. Don't you think, guys, that it's time to grow up? it seems to me that with you that process got somewhat delayed. I shall work, too. We'll manage. And what about your institute? Your education? You're a gifted girl. It would be a pity... We'll do both. It would be wiser to stay here. There's enough room. - What is it you don't like here? - I don't know. But lately I don't feel like coming home. Perhaps It's because I'm growing up. Even if that process has been somewhat delayed. He must be getting a pretty strange impression of our home. I'm not trying to make him get a good impression. What should I do? Protect. In vain we have. He did not seem a bad guy. In vain! What do you look at me, as the gray wolf? I should be on your way to see. Previously, it was called class flair. I watch TV. In this case, you have this kind, as if you are at least You are going to eat it. Ha! And you're in the mood today. Right entertainer! By the way, an entertainer - it not an insult. Don't you think the problem is not that you find it hard to live here. You'll find it as difficult to live elsewhere. I've already heard it, and even read about it. You should know better that our young people aren't afraid of difficulties. Go on. I already know everything you can tell me. And you? Why are you silent? What do you know about me that so silent? I do not know anything. - Of course, I guess? - Tired of it all! - What are you tired? - Speak. And you did not? And then everything is fine! Soon they diverged, and we will friends houses. No, wait a minute. I want to answer. I used to answer. I understand that at your age it decided not to respect. But any protest must be specific source. - What protest? - And you I do not see. I see two inexperienced young people, who consider me their almost not the class enemy, forgetting that this so-called, the enemy did something for the people. And especially for you. - Dad, what people? For you this term, but for me This is my personal destiny, life. The people - these are the people, that unlike you work. As long as you do figuring out what is good and what is bad. But I also work. But I do not brag about it on behalf of the people. - This is demagoguery. I'm not bragging, but exactly define their place in society. Do not, of course, to rush words ... but with this small and begins what is called ideological revision. All this does not benefit neither you, or our system as a whole. And it is good for our enemies. You should not have sharp, I do not quite understand this humor. What you goals scored? - What do you need? - Yes indeed. With the cult of personality over, foreign films we show, rags INSTRAW partly sell an easy to justify and legitimize the music, Titov orbited 17 times around the Earth, Christmas tree in the Kremlin. What else does? What, you do not like it? It suits me. Do not catch me at my word. I just do not want to talk every day you 'thank you' for what I live, I get up in the morning and not afraid of anything. - So, I'm not satisfied? - So you. - Very specific. - It is. And why I'm not satisfied? Could you explain. Because I do not believe you. You are welcome. Because you always say one thing, and think and do another. - Everything is not so simple. - Just one day jump in height or long? Or even the sixth. And thus in Australia You can go. Do not you think that all this tactless, inappropriate and not very smart, to put it mildly. What do you think about this conversation? What do you care? You don't want to know and it doesn't interest you. All you want is that people think less. You're wrong, one always ought to think, especially at your age. - How old are you? - 23. What do you want to become at 30? A kosmonaut. I don't believe in people who are too witty at an early age. I like it that you're keeping silent, Sergey. I too used to be silent and listening. Anya, answer the phone! Sometimes people say very useful things. Well, show me these people. Let's look real. I, by the way, do not treat her badly. And I think you're serious Man. You have such an age, when everything is solved. All of life can be defined during some years. Or you spend yourself on the small stuff, on trivia, and ultimately will achieve nothing. Or... - Slow down, you can? Wait a second. Oh my God! Lately I've got out of touch with my daughter. It happens sometimes. I don't know how to explain it to you ... But all this ... is not much fun. I want to talk to you. She trusts you, and in my opinion, considers your opinion. I told her something that must inspire? It is unlikely that this is my work. - Talk to her seriously. How do I ... loved one. Explain to her that all these windings are not worth a penny ruptured. What does all this stupid and pointless and eventually it will remain with nothing. Do you understand? I do not quite understand what it means, In your opinion, winding? What are you talking about? - Sit down. Sit down. You admit that there is still some experience of age? Generally yes, although there is such an experience ... which I personally do not envy. - Well, that's a difficult question. Let's talk about the two of you. Believe me, for me it is now very important. - I believe. - You're not a boy. And she's a grown girl, it is time for her to give birth. It's time to finish the institute and you wander in search of something that, what you do have a vague performance. It's hard to argue with you, You are so... convincing and friendly. - You should not have ... Honestly, my friends, somehow separate the something itself from us. This is our generation ... so to speak... our age. Spend, so to speak, that this trait. We're soulmates. But why? We do not separate. Probably not ... And if the devil, most do not know something like that! What is this geometric talk I do not understand this. Simply, we do not separate one, and every generation has its own swine and decent people. So the young are bastards, I'm even worse. Fundamentally worse - they are even worse. - Here, here, here! That's the whole point. You will achieve nothing, until you realize that life is not from idle talk, and from specific cases. I knew people who did not work, it did not. They have turned into nothing, in the slush. By the way, they were good people. But somehow, once they did not understand. Oh, brothers! You do not think about yourself, none of you would think. The staff? Well, in general I see, that in spite of all these your ... protests, etc., you have an easy life. Do you have time for all this nonsense. For me it was not like that, it may be now that I have everything! For what? What for? For the sake of it. For maybe you. - Something I catch bad connection times. - What? There is nothing. For the sake of your common future, if you repeat, think about this seriously enough. - Enough. - Oh, brother ... I can not, but the head is bursting. Oh!.. I don't know you people, I don't know life. You crush, crush. Do not trust anyone you. Take care of you myself. Understand you in their own backyard. In principle, you are not wanted, guys are ... - Well, do you think that goes ... - Do not. Do not argue. Not what it. If you like, I somehow ... you prove the opposite point of view. Come on, and then they just called and they said they are waiting for us. All alone together, and we are with you, like two turtles. ??? children's chorus "As the highest court of mine, Communist, There is a fellow at the Polytechnic. Polytechnic - my Russia!

And Lermontov, but - at first Everything begins and drove the horse, And the woman cried to him: "Love me, love me!" Dantes was lying among the snowdrifts, The climb was not able to land, And by slow, hard, Do not look back, people were walking.

" "We do not hold hands namuchennyh Do not teach us how to embrace his mother. We breathe thoroughly hospitals We squeal plenty crutches So how do we now do not understand, Earthly joys Shoots over the fields. " 20 years ago, I was 20 years old. And all my mates were 20 years old, well, some 22 or 23. We lived in Moscow, studied the Literary Institute and wrote poetry, Some worse, others better. And then the war started, we all went to war, and those who wrote the best poems were killed. Killed at the front. Before leaving for the front Misha Kulchitsky had introduced into the house, where we loved, a poem. As a matter of fact, scraps of poems. And it sounded like this: "I used to think, Lieutenant, It sounds like this:"Pour us!" And knowing the topography He stomps on the gravel. The war was not fireworks, And just hard work. Then the black sweat Ploughing up crawling infantry, For fighters and buttons Like scales heavy orders. Not until the order would be homeland. Let though after a hundred Borodino! " A few days later Lieutenant Kulchitsky He died a heroic death at the front. There was also a poet - Pavel Kogan. His last poem No one knows. But before leaving for the front, he gave me a long poem, from which I remember three lines: "Break the grass, grass povelikoy We prorast?m of bitter povelikoy As our blood watered the earth. " hope I'll be back then, When the trumpeter play lights out. When the pipe to his lips bring And a sharp elbow are allotted. hope I will stay intact: not for me raw land, And for me - your alarm And your worries kind world. But if you pass a century, And you hope to get tired, Hope, if you need me Death to open its wings, You Command, then let Trumpeter wounded privstanet, To the last pomegranate I was not able to finish. But if suddenly one day I will not be able to protect yourself, What is the new battle Not swayed used globe, I'm still falling in that, On the sole civil, And commissars in dusty helmets Bow down silently over me. I'm still falling in that, On the sole civil, And commissars in dusty helmets Bow down silently over me. Comrades, I just wonder, I'm here. This is just a miracle! Today I just came from Voronezh, I did not have time even to hotel stay, here it is possible to say in such a way I was here. I'm just happy and I want to say thank you very much Andrei Voznesensky, Yevgeny Yevtushenko. I know them for a long time. I mean, I know their poems and I love. Oh I do not even know... Recently... It was published in "Literary newspaper "article Nicholas Oseeva "How to be Ascension?" Really, Voznesensky how to be? Therefore, many in our Soviet, space age perhaps only a poet, which in shape and its you know, it gives the start, gives This idea of ??the rhythm of this era. And Ascension it is the best at it. Here! Well, rebuke him, of course, for the fact that he He writes about the Soviet geologists, I will not. Because it's silly, of course. Here! Well, that's a ... Yes, I know that they are in youth We loved collectors work. Uh ... well, that's about the other what? That's about Okudzhava. Well, of course, it is very good, that poets are good and different. Okudzhava very different and often very good. Here! That you know, especially uh ... When is it good? That's ... just for me ... Here there is a campfire sing songs ... Well, Okudzhava - this, of course, very cool. Under the guitar so ... The measure can become an inveterate drunkard. Here are ... But ... uh ... because you know, life is something very diverse. Comrades! But it is worth reminding that the Mayakovsky's words, who said: that "verse is a bomb and a banner, and the singer's voice raises the class. " So it is, that's when, here this evening a great event ... Hit, you know. With difficulty I managed. Well, that drew attention. First of all, all these poets, some gloom, you know, in a moan. Many ... Something such as if something is not satisfied. Something oppresses them. Not good! Good for you! And we have in life, comrades, so beautiful, good examples, You can catch a century. Even singing the praises of Comrade Yevtushenko. I understand them, I support. A talented poet, good! But somehow, so ... Somehow, I'm offended. About our Soviet army, So he writes Hush hush! Cumming, everything! I was concluding, comrades. Comrades! And I would like to wish poets that they really showed more good We teach us well, do not forget our valiant army. So! And for our part we will do everything You understand that they worked. We, as its part, I as a representative armed forces declare Mayakovsky's words: "Who does not want to stretch out hands, will force to stretch the legs! " Let them do, you know, your business! "Farewell to you, Polytechnic! Our life's running short. It's not ovations that matter, We're melting into human multitudes Within your space, Polytechnic. It's unbearable to part with you. - You know, I have news for you. - What news? I left the house. - How to go? - So. - When? - Today. Say goodbye, He took the suitcase and left. I have it here in the locker room. You seem surprised? How to say to you... Where are we going to live? We can live at my place. No. How about going visiting every other one? What do you mean? First visit my friends, then yours, then mine again, and so all through the night. I don't know. Never tried it. Does it embarass you? Then we'll go only to mine. It's nice visiting. Let's have a night of fun to spite everybody. You know, I got so much to tell you. And what shall I say? You don't have to tell me anything. It's strange that we didn't know each other and even might have never met. One doesn't place an ad in a paper - "Looking for a good man". Though, why not? I'll open up a paper in the morning and call you. I'll say, "Hello. You've been waiting for me?" And I'll reply: Where have you been for so long?" And where have you been? Doesn't matter. What matters is that we've found each other. If you had a son ... how would you call him? I do not know. And a daughter? Do you love me? And you? Do you love me? And you me? Do you love me? And you me? Do you love me? And you me? Where's the suitcase? Where are we left? And to hell with it, return. You had fun? - No. - And me too. And everyone? - It is not clear, why to collect? - Maybe you are right. But not going to something worse. May be. Perhaps we live badly, not properly. But where is the most correct, full life? They say it is in Siberia. We can not all given the same take and go to Siberia? Hmm! Here we are, home. - I'm scared, I don't want to go there. - Do not go then. The only thing possible to save some feelings for one's parents, its not see them at all. - Well ... then we'll live at my place. - In the closet. Dad, Mom, my wife and me. No Dad. Sorry. - Well? - Well what? - Well? Well, must decide. - Decide what? I do not understand, why make irresponsible statements, leave home in the evening with big declarations, only to return there at dawn and say "good morning"? - You do not like? - I do not like. I believe either - or. Or not worth fray. Well, what do you want from me? Single-mindedness, consistency of thoughts and actions, inner harmony? But I'm not a harmonious person. - Yes I know. Harmonious were only the ancient Greeks. Elina. - Spartans. - Augean stables. 23 labors of Hercules. But because it is difficult to verify, maybe leave the Greeks alone? With pleasure. I can't talk about serious things at such an early hour. Wildly I want to sleep. - Good night. - Good morning. Well! Well! - Hello, Naum Abramitch! Do you have any books by Fokin? - Fokin ... Faulkner, perhaps? - No, Fokin. A Fokina! Yes, we have. - Is not it? How much it costs? - 15 kopecks. - Well, thank you very much. - A "News" has not yet come? - No. - N. Fokin "Awakening". - Are you finished? - Yes, now it makes sense. Have to check the record of a series and zero. Check it yourself tomorrow. Of course, myself. Kohl's, you'r going back home, right? No, I'll stay here some more. By the way, get the commutation scheme for tomorrow. Programmers prepare. - Nick, so you'll call the evening? As agreed, right? - How you doing? - All right. - Have you distributed the tickets? - Did it yesterday. - At the Kuznetsk I got the collected works. - Well! Well done. - All finished? - Yeah, bye. - Take care, Shura. - Bye then. - What's the play? - "Five Evenings". - By Raikin? - Well no. - Oh yes! "Sovremennik" Theatre. - Come on, check it once more. - I have already. I mixed it up with "Good Evening" by Shurov and Rykunin. - If you get a chance, go and see it. - You're just like Vladimir Vassilich. He advised me to see the Vienna Ballet, which toured a year ago. - Funny guy. - You've known him long? Since I came to work here. He's got a swell tape-recorder. - An imported one? - He made it himself. And what do you think? Yes, so we communicate sometimes. That's right, do not leave him. And then we have all the young, and he ... It should it somehow be involved. We offered him in parachuting club. Thank you. I know you're joking. A man once breaks off. Not from the band ... just from the people. Well, what we know about him? It works ... Interestingly, among us, of course. What do you think about him? - In what sense? - Well, what people usually think of? I find it interesting to check their feelings. So you train well you know, I to treat him. - Yes, he's working well. - Good work. He works well ... speaks as if something ... Yes! - Yes, he is a man with a sense of humor. Well no! No. Yes, a man with a sense of humor. As if he knows something that ... that we do not know. mind you, he never says it to the end. In my opinion, he always speaks his mind. No, Nick, so it seems. For some, it is necessary? Scolds, then have a good man. What abuses? How? What are the motives? - Is there something I do not quite understand. - You know, Nick, now criticize ... easier than praise. Since work is not expelled, and increased credibility. I remember he once read a newspaper, and then aloud for all says: "You can not advertise our system like a refrigerator. " You train yourself laughing. Kolya... we say to you frankly. No witnesses. Sit down. Yes, I laughed, realizing what was happening. And that while he thought? Nonsense! You do not know him at all. That that's the case. On hunches, you know, It does not go far. I do not want to, you know, climb into the soul. A person that is not enough? How are you? You know, these candid conversations heart to heart with the boss. - Yeah! I smoke? - Yeah, smoke, smoke. We are alone, no firemen. But it's nothing. But this is the case. You just put yourself in my place, do not misunderstand me. Some comrades may not without reason, have had the impression that Vladimir Vassilich, some of his statements ... Well, as is the ... write, disorient our range. - There is no companions? - Well, let's not comrades, Suppose it's I who thinks so. I'm not sure. But can I, formed such an opinion? Well, if I'm wrong, that's for the better. Always nice in this case, to be wrong. Vladimir Vassilich trusts you more than others, you know him well. So what? No one is forcing you to slander him. But it can't be avoided old chap, trust but verify. For us calmer, we instead ... anyone. This is the highest form of trust - We, not anybody! Well, you know yourself, then, I talking about? Oh, yes, I'm responsible for every word. If we were not alone ... If it wasn't like this, I would have punched you up. Y-yes? .. What stops you? I don't like doing it without witnesses. - Maybe we go somewhere? - Well, let's go. - And where to? - You'll see when you get there. - Uh! How to Play? - 2:1. - In favor of whom? - Torpedo. - Order! Maybe Lucia take with you? Listen! Come threesome. Heard the anecdote? Two jump down with parachutes. They pull the ring, all goes right. Suddenly they see a 3rd one fall like a stone. He put on his kitbag again. An old joke, but funny. Did you hear the last question ... - We did. - Did you call me? - I did. - What happened? - Nothing. I needed you! You know, there is such a word - "need". He's got a swell girl, I saw her yesterday at Petrovka. And now? Now not needed, now everything's all right. Yes, a very lively conversation. Shall we talk about something else? For example, about soccer. - About hockey ... - Ice hockey! Let's go and have a... - I don't want to. - Why not? I don't know, but I have an impression. Mind, it may be my personal impression. That people are divided into those with whom you drink and those with whom you can talk. We used to combine that before. Yes, before, but now I'm afraid we won't be able to. I've never seen him having such an idiotic mood. It's just that we haven't seen one another for long, Slava. You know, pals, life is taking its usual course. Each morning, I get up, go to work, buy cigarettes, eat, breathe, go to movies. And everyday I see both of you, not counting the army, business trips and other understandable reasons. And this is my life. I can't live otherwise. Perhaps it's a habit? I don't want to change my habits. This is called Erich Maria Remarque. If you wish, I'll rush to you in a racing car through the fog. We may joke, but we'd better not. All right, get down to business. Be more specific. You're so businesslike. You both are. I'm not businesslike, I'm preoccupied. You are currently so, in order of general discussion on the theme of good and evil? Well, what does it matter? Well, just to say we or humanity, or you personally. Well, I don't understand, that you care so much? Well, a common phenomenon, that's all. He's always there, sitting in front of you, young and prosperous, with honest eyes. Just a horrendous character. You know, lately I've got tired of joking. You're getting old, Kolia. When people have nothing to talk about, they crack jokes. When they have nothing to think about, they joke. It makes life easier. By the logic of our conversation, you're implying that I joke too much and therefore... There's no therefore. I don't always understand what you're thinking of when you talk like this. I guess it's not necessary. Of course, there's nothing necessary about this. You've got a rotten disposition lately. Maybe sometimes we should get it rotten. - Should we? - We should. Why am I saying all this to you? You don't care about it, you don't need it. I can see that. Remember when you said that at school I learned to turn off the mind? Listen and do not hear. There have always been enough bastards, in all time and among all peoples. It's clear, he's a bastard. I believe you. You told him so, and what's the use? Has anything changed? Nothing. If you respect yourself, I think you shouldn't even sink as low as even speak to such men. But what can you do? What can I do, or Slavka? You may accept or not accept those people, however, they exist and you have to reckon with it. Does he really think so or just playing the fool? The most important thing is everyone's personal integrity. Everyone is answerable only for his own actions. - There is such a theory. - You live among people. You and other people. And you can't do anything about it. You have to understand this and stop torturing yourself. To understand what? To define a degree of relationships and set yourself a limit. Have you done it already? - I'm in the process. - Well, go on. - I can't smoke here, can I? - No. All right, enough of that. I'm glad we had it out at last. No need to beat around the bush here, everything in life is much simpler. And let's call things by their right names. It had to happen some day. We've grown up and we look differently at many things. - I'm not accusing you. - Why not? Go ahead. Well, obviously, from your own position, you're right. It's not the best position, but there're even worse ones. Well, thanks for that. See you. I got to run. Of course, there's so much to do - birthdays, holidays. You're going to get it... You're such a brave guy. The next station "Komsomolskaya". - Next "Supermarket". Hello, Comrade Yermakova. Citizen, Citizen! 2 kopecks. I haven't seen you for quite a while. - Hello. - What's new? Nothing. Working all the time. Can I smoke here? So that no one see you. - What's new with you? - My shoes. I'm serious. Bought Czechoslovakian shoes last week. Nothing else new. You don't look today as you usually look. - And what do I look like usually? - You're not smiling today. I'm tired, too much work. The Petrov Club. And then over the wings sunset Next stop - Department Store. Guys, c'mon, let's buy tickets. For a long time I will dream A conductor on the tram. For a long time I will dream you... Do not look, do not care, I can think of anything else. Where're your friends? They have their personal lives. Haven't you any personal life? No, only my public life. You got to get off. You'll miss your stop. I'm going to ride on, comrade Yermakova, will finish my cigarette. Vorobyov Alley. Next stop - School. Why do you address me by my last name? - You don't like it? - Well, no. Why are you asking then? Just wanted to say that I got a first name, too. What is it? Katya. Katerina. Nice name. - And what's yours? - Nikolai. Kolia. Yes, I know. Now we got acquainted. Next stop - Stadium. At first I mixed up all stops, couldn't remember the names. The passengers were not happy. And now I can announce the next stop without even looking. I was even memorizing them. Closing my eyes and repeating them. Like poems? Why are you laughing? When I was in school, I suddenly began writing poems. I, too, had mine printed once in our wall newspaper. - Really? - About Paul Robeson. He couldn't be scared by any fiend, At last he came to visit. Our overseas black friend, A fighter, a singer, and no midget. Next stop - Proyektirovochnaya. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Here's the money. - Here's your ticket. Thanks. I also wrote public verses, and also for a wall newspaper. The leaves of birch trees are so calm, Here's our own collective farm. But mostly I wrote about love, in imitation, of course. Funny, isn't it? - Yes, funny. - Why don't you laugh, then? I'm laughing with inner. Scary? Very scary. Actually, at that time I'm laughing with inner laughter. You were lying, it's not that you're tired. Are you having troubles? C'mon give me your ticket. - Everything will end up well. - How do you know? You've got a lucky ticket. Save it. - I'll sure do it. - You'll be in luck. Thank you for that. Next stop - Burevestnik. Tomorrow I'm going to sleep late. It's my day off. And will go to movies in the evening. - Did you see the movie "Girls"? - No. It'll be on tomorrow again at the "Petrel". No, I haven't seen it. The tram goes to the depot! Why? Well, goodbye, Katya. By etiquette, a man shouldn't do it first. To hell with the etiquette. You're a nice girl. Now you've noticed. Very nice. Goodbye. - Take care. - Thanks. I'll try to. You're lucky you've got someone like me, or you would've perished. Mom, aren't we lucky! Three books of "The Red and the Black". - Seryozha, want me to give you one? - Sure. He knows the classics only by movies. It's shorter and ideologically correct, everything's clear. You're as up-to-date as the Youth Cafe. Does my sister visit the Youth Cafe? - And where do you go? - To the planetarium. So you're going to the planetarium? What are they showing today? The mystery of the Tungus meteorite. The greatest mystery is your girlfriend. Why are you pestering the boy? He's in a hurry, he got no time. Of course, he got no time. Very busy young people. They're deciding now a difficult problem: where to live. - Really? - Really. I think since you've told me it's no secret anymore. Vera, it's none of your business. Sure, none of mine and none of yours. You keep mum and try to be delicate. - You'll have more room for yourselves. - We're not cramped as it is. Why don't you bring her here? For us to meet her and look at her. - I will. - Big deal, a very important person. All right, stop it. Books are good when there're not too many of them. - "The Problems of Therapy". - Vera, wait, not this one... All right. How about "Analytical Geometry", published in 1936? Perhaps we can throw it away? I'd rather not, these are your dad's books. - You all thumbs. - I didn't mean to. Look, what's this? Some documents. Documents. Mom. - I think this is... - Where did you find them? - Right here. Where? Here? Oh God, how could it be? For the month of October 1941. It's almost an archeological find. We can report it to a newspaper. A worker's food coupon. A worker's one is mine. They issued them to us in the hospital. And a child's one, is it mine? Seryozha's. You hadn't been born yet. Oh God, what a fool I am. How could I have put them here? Look kids. They're for two full decades. That means a lot of bread. Let's celebrate their 20th anniversary. Esteemed food coupons... There's nothing funny about it. Seryozha and I had to live without them for over half a month. - And how did you survive then? - Just like that... Eating only potatoes. At night I had to be on duty at the hospital, and in the daytime I went to the country to dig up some potatoes. I remember some soldiers gave me a lift. It was near Skhodnya. They were digging up trenches, and I potatoes. I had no fear at the time, except that we had lost our food coupons. It was only later that I got scared to death. The soldiers went somewhere. It was evening. I'm digging up potatoes. It was so cold, so muddy. And I'm sobbing, sobbing all the time. Then I went back home. I'm walking, not knowing where the Germans are. Perhaps ahead of me? And the sack is very heavy and wet. But I can't drop and leave it. The hungry Seryozhka's waiting home, and there's nothing else to give him. I reached Moscow. The streets were empty and cold. Our street was barricaded with sacks of sand. Only embrasures stuck out. Soldiers patrolling the streets. I fed Seryozha and ran to the hospital. And while I was away that night, your father came home. Right from the front line, just for two hours. He hadn't even woken you up. Just kissed you and left. What about me? - You hadn't been born yet. - Why not? Just hadn't, and that's all. I saw your father one more time in the winter of 1943. He lived at home for a month after hospital. Damn. What is it? Can't knot my tie. You're going to suffocate me. Got such a thick neck. You should be put on a ration of 40 grams of oats. - What do you need such a neck for? - For my tie. I'm off, Mom. Olga Mikhailovna. You won't be back late, will you? No, not late. I'm off. Kolia dear, come home, It's late already. I got to go, too. Goodbye. -Thanks for your help. - Not at all. Sorry for writing curtly and illegibly. It's a horrible din, the artillery preparation has begun. As usual, I found just the right time for writing a letter. There're many Muscovites here, even guys from our institute. You know one of them - It's Dimka Solovyov. Remember him visiting us once on October holidays? I could have never imagined that I'd sit in a trench and write to you. Though, to be absolutely honest, sometimes I had such a thought. But I never believed that the fascists would come so close to Moscow. I don't know if I survive, but I'm confident that Moscow will survive, the USSR will survive. Maybe we didn't say so very often, but we always thought so. That's all. Kissing you and Seryozha. The artillery's done its work. Now it's our turn to go. A whirl with events, packed with jobs one too many... packed with jobs one too many, the day slowly sinks as the night shadows fail. Shadows fail. As the night shadows fail. Comrade Lenin, I report to you not by a dictate of office, by the heart's prompting alone. Comrade Lenin, the hellish work that we're out to do will be done and is already being done. And is already being done... No, Seryozha, you're wrong. I can't agree with you. And it's not about Chernousov. I don't give a damn about him. What can he do to me? But it pains me, just pains me that because of this situation I may lose you, a man very dear to me... ??? tram tickets 3 kopecks 10 kopecks Congratulations. I join in. How old are you? - Who asks such questions? - 22. Why we're not at the National? Is a homemade pie in the making? Aren't you tired of going to the National Restaurant with him? No, I'm not. - And where do you go? - From where it's easier to escape. Where is that? One can escape from anywhere but the Petropavlovsk Fortress. I got that idea last year. - At your birthday party. - I don't remember that. I propose a toast to Anya's parents. I have no objections. - We're not drinking that toast. - Why not? Why? Because. Let's assume I'm a foundling. - She isn't doing badly as a foundling. - She's an egotist. I'm even better off, I got no parents. An orphan? And where are they? Near Smolensk. Parents are for borrowing money from them. - Do they give you money? - Not to me. Perhaps they're right. I can't believe that my daughter, will treat her parents like that. - How old is your daughter? - She'll be 12 months soon. A happy father. Can't be happier. Everyone can get that happy. Why don't you have any children? Do you have children? We got no nanny, we keep watch over our son. It's not a son, It's a sentry service. They say if you have three babies at once, you're given an apartment. A great opportunity to get rid of neighbors. How can you know how many you'll get at once? Here's the man who could be a father to a huge family. You're mistaken. I'm the man. I've got an apartment. Will Dolgoruky come? - Who? - Yuri Dolgoruky. - How can he? - Will come all the way here. All last year. Or on your birthday. Or, as the New Year. Only the trees there. And Santa Claus. I never celebrate birthday. There is always a reason to just drink. What were you just thinking about? I have a feeling that today something must... What? No, nothing. You're a strange guy. I never know what you might be thinking when you're silent like this. Hey, you, think of something! Let's drink. Not me, I feel good as it is. Boredom is normal thinking person. It is time to accept this. - I skukoulovitel. - You are a very accurate instrument. - I can recite poetry. Turn off the recorder - recites. And I do not understand poetry, when they read aloud. Can then better fable? On a plane encountered a Fugue. The moral - they do not understand each other. This, too, I came up with. - "The Lay of Igor" do not you come up? - I! We do not have any poems or fables, let's do a gymnastic pyramid. Hi! Hi, our dear potatoes! Everyone got sour here. Meet my friend. - Yura. - Kolia. All we needed here is you. Where did you get it? At the Metropole. A dish by special order. Potatoes "? la Russe". Take your coat off. I can't, I have to make three more visits. Even got no time for work. Then don't work. Congratulations. The potatoes onto the table! Why do you keep silent all the time? I know almost nobody here. It's even better. It's so boring being among your own. There're only your own here. - How you doing? - So-so. Have you been to anywhere? Couldn't you have asked something else? About what? Seryozha. Seryozha, you're wanted on the phone. The Urals Automobile Works has finished testing a new powerful car... Yes? Hello? Who? Slavka? Yes, it's me. Speak louder, I can't hear anything. What? I think you're exaggerating. Yes, as if it's the first time that Kolka didn't spend the night home. Yes, I think so. You're wrong. Yes. All right. Bye. All right. Thank you. A fall-winter fashion. Please, pay attention. This outfit got a special award for modesty at the Cannes festival. A very practical garment for balls, exhibitions and recreation, countryside recreation, playing skittles, and business trips. The line starts at the throat and ends in pleats in the area of the spine. You'll need 3 meters of fabric 1.45 wide to make it. Dances! - Shall we dance? - Yes. I was at a fashion show once. It looked just like this. I'm a model. - May I have your phone number? - I'm married. I'm not asking for your hand, just a phone number. - What letter does it start with? - K. I'm saying no more. Quiet! You're in for a surprise, something like bast shoes and potatoes. Come on, come on. Flying ducks. Now we've got a complete set. Bast shoes, potatoes. An old ritual song. All we need here are Gypsies and bears. Oh! .. I love ... I love ... not rain! Oh! .. I love ... I love ... not rain! Enough of that. Let's drink. To what? To potatoes. Why not to turnips? I want to drink to potatoes. Maybe you'd better say that toast in verse? It's clear that love is no potato. To potatoes. A toast to the beat of drums. Experienced orators knock through the rostrum with a fist. I don't understand what you meant by that? And I understand. I can guess. What do you understand? Omitting all details, explanations, protestations and incantations, I'll define all your ideas about potatoes like this: hurrah or "kvass" patriotism. - What? - Derived from the word "kvass". One can't take it seriously. Perhaps. But what should we take seriously? What actually can we talk about seriously? Only don't take upon yourself the role of national conscience. Stop playing the fool. I can talk like this, too. We all can. And what's next? Are there things you can talk seriously about? Can you answer that? If there's nothing you can talk seriously about, why live, then? This is a provocative question. I can put this question to you, too. And I'll answer you. I take seriously the Revolution, the "Internationale" anthem, the year of 1937, the war, the soldiers, the fact that almost all of us have no fathers, and the potatoes, too, which had saved us during the hunger and which... - And what do you think of turnips? - What? What do you think of turnips? You never said. It was a nasty thing to say. I said it automatically. Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Take it easy. You have to sort it out quietly. Do you hear? With a cool head. I don't want to go on like this. I don't want to. One shouldn't drift with the current. One shouldn't just drift. All right, gather up your willpower. Hold yourself together. Today is the turning point. I don't want to just wear out the time, to wear out the days. Nothing lives its separate life. Nothing. Try to understand, nothing exists separately. Love, separately, life, separately, the time you live in, separately. Don't stand up. That's what you're like. - Is this your wife? - No, my sister. Your sister? What's her name? Verka. Vera. And where's mother? On duty at the hospital. - You work, too? - Yes. I had never thought I'd have two kids like you. Do you remember me at all? I thought you were older. Were you all so young? We were like you. I'm glad you've come. What's the matter with you? Can you tell me? Yes. You have to explain to me a lot of things. - What can I... - Everything. I believe no one as I believe you. I need your advice, I need it now... I am now very ... Is there something you wanted to say? Yes. You know ... is currently ... - Direct, head breaks. - Speak, I'm listening. Well, you all have been different. - I mean, everything was different. - Everyone is different. - It is natural. You're a strange man. - No, you know. Did you know that you need to do. I knew! I knew that you have to shoot for example, run forward shouting "Hurrah." Not a coward! - You think... You think to run and shoot, not a coward, do you think that enough? Well, no, I just can own it all. You know, myself! ... That is life. You know, a normal life. How... Yes that there, I do not want to say about him all sorts of big words. But sometimes ... when ... one on one with a ... with his ... conscience. Then... - Smoke? Yes. Well, I do not know how to explain to you. You know ... Not all. I understand that... you had some difficulties. I do not know what. - I guess you is not easy. - You do not know much, do not know. - It is a pity that now fall. - What? Come, let's swim ... You like swimming? - Yes. You say you do not mean that. But we have so much time with you not seen. Without you, it was very difficult. And those who survived not all of these, as you think. It is possible, perhaps not all. I envy you. - What? I envy. You are richer than we are. That's all our wealth. You're vain all that I say. You must understand! There ... How would you explain that? - Hush. Hush. You'll wake up the guys. Are they alive? I don't know, I can only point out those who had been killed before. Him, and him. And this one. They'd all been killed in early morning, too early, about 5 o'clock, in the attack. And you? A day later, also in the morning, and also during an attack. It was raining the night before, it was autumn. - Were you afraid? - Yes. We run through the woods with "hurrah", guys are falling down beside us, but we don't stop, keep on running. In the woods you never know where they may fire from. Did you know that you'd be killed? No. I thought I'd survive. Then I realized it was over. The others ran on, forward. I don't know who managed to make it. Let's have a drink? OK. I drink to you. And I to you. I would like to run next time. Do not. What do you want? Live. But how? How? How old are you? 23. And I'm 21. Well, I can tell you advise? Are you going? Yes, I must go. Dad! I forgot matches. The funny thing is, I know them so long ago, he did not even remember when we met. 15 years, probably. Somehow, I'm sure that would be. Whatever happens, we'll be together. Always together. And in general, everything is great and I would like nothing else. I'm harder than you, it is clear, it is not even worth talking about. But I am happy that I have in addition to the family ... So ... there you are. Both. Every day and for life. And no matter what happens, my friends, I am always with you. You know that. Do not be afraid if you are not alone, and you have something to believe in. And waking up in the morning to know that is to start the day. I wanted to see you guys. I'm very much value the fact that you've got in the world, that we live here, and nowhere to live anymore could not. And sometimes it is difficult to I do not have, I know, there is nothing more we have. It's all ours, the only thing possible. And we will be faithful to this until the end. I know it. It was Monday ... the first working day of the week. restoration "Mosfilm" 1990 THE END Russian subtitles: bornik @ KG 2016 Engl. translation: T. Kameneva & google timings: serdar202 @ KG
