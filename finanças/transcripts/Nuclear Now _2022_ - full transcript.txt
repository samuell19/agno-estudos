We've been trained from the very beginning to fear nuclear power and with it our terror of radiation. It was in our subconsciousness. There was the original sin of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It became a collective trauma. With schoolchildren responding to nuclear alerts and the need for fallout shelters. Having been told more than once that civilization could be destroyed in a few moments with little, if any, warning. There are movies in the 1950s already picturing the doom of man from radiated sea monsters, and all kinds of genetically mutated creatures. No doubt, it was the outcome for us who were severing Mother Nature from human nature with our technology. It was a horrible vision. Bigger than any child's basic fear of death. It was a death of everyone and everything. The end of the world almost happened in October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But President Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union mercifully backed down. Young people began protesting the system that produced cruel wars and nuclear weapons. Along with various injustices and the destruction of nature. A counterculture emerged offering a broad critique of American society. Industrial capitalism and corporate America were seen as the enemy. Earth Day 1970 marked a visible shift in global consciousness, drawing huge crowds who became a key rallying point for environmentalism and the counterculture. It created broad public support for anti-pollution measures, and within this atmosphere, the government's push for nuclear energy was suddenly suspect. Licensing and construction of nuclear reactors was ramping up, and the fear of nuclear energy plants in your own backyard merged into an army of other pollutions fouling the earth. - We realize that when these multinational corporations, we are going to have uranium mining and uranium milling. We're going to have possibly nuclear power plants, we're going to possibly have high level nuclear waste disposal. No one in the world wants nuclear waste. We have to have either oil or coal or whatever, but certainly not nuclear. And as with all emerging technologies, there were setbacks. It was the first step in a nuclear nightmare. As far as we know at this hour, no worse than that. Three Mile Island was the only famous nuclear accident in the United States ever. fifty thousand gallons of radioactive water escaped into the reactor building... Yet no one was harmed. But the public was shaken. And the breathless news coverage with no acknowledgment of the lack of casualties. Officials of Metropolitan Edison conceded some workers may have been contaminated. Stoked their fears into a sense of urgency and even panic. But in a twist of history, it happened just as a fictional nuclear power disaster movie was in theaters. Barney, give me feedwater! Goddamn it! No please, let me ask a question. Tell us what happened inside. Misinformation about nuclear's true potential and safety spread rampant. If there's one accident, it could just devastate an area like southern New York State Nuclear power would produce over 32,000 cancer deaths per year in the United States. People don't think well when they're scared. Fear is a mind killer. And all these fears traumatized young people. And as momentum built towards anti-nuclear sentiment, a second potentially avoidable disaster struck. We were recently stricken by a disaster, the Chernobyl nuclear power accident. It deeply affected the Soviet people and disturbed world opinion. I too, once believed the environmentalists were right and that nuclear power was dangerous. We were in our way terribly miseducated, subconsciously cross-wiring nuclear war with nuclear power. And then as nuclear energy was being quietly shunted to the side as an aberration in our scientific development, another physical revolution snowballed into the public consciousness. Completely eclipsing the nuclear controversy. Climate change. It was as bad or even worse to the imagination as nuclear extinction had been. Which in a way we had accustomed ourselves to. But here now is a monster that could, in fact, deliver the end of the world. Climate scientists were now warning us that humans were destabilizing the world's ecological systems. In 1988, the congressional testimony of Dr. James Hansen, a leading climate scientist, rang the alarm loudly and clearly. - We have already reached one tipping point, and we are going to lose all of the sea ice in the Arctic in the summer season. Among others, he clarified they were burning more and more fossil fuels and dumping too much carbon into the atmosphere. Mostly gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These gases were raising global temperatures and beginning to change the climate. An outspoken minority reacted with sarcasm and anger. - You know what this is? It's a snowball. And that's just from outside here. So it's very, very cold out, very unseasonal. So, Mr. President, catch this. They thought the notion highly exaggerated and overblown, while on the other side, many others reacted with alarm, demanding radical change. Hope is taking action. We can still turn this around. It will take drastic annual emission cuts unlike anything the world has ever seen. In 2021, the IPCC stated that if we didn't cut carbon emissions by nearly 100% in less than 30 years, by 2050 the world would suffer serious damage to ecosystems and economies because we are still depending on fossil fuels for one of our most basic needs. Electricity. Most of our power still comes from burning gas and coal, and the amount is going up not down. The resulting volume of carbon free electricity needed over the next 30 years is almost unimaginable. Realistic estimates range from two to four times the electricity we currently use. This is an even bigger problem than we thought. How can we create even more electricity and still cut down on carbon dioxide emissions to halt the climate crisis? We've run out of time to be afraid. It's time to look again at a proven source of energy. It's time to look again at nuclear. Because this incredible power, the very thing that we fear is what may save us. An estimated five billion years ago, our sun and solar system were formed in the aftermath of an exploding star. Scientists call this kind of explosion a supernova. Light, x-rays and radio waves pour out in every direction and immense shock waves with unimaginable energy fling matter across great distances. A bit of that matter collided and became Earth. Hidden below the surface of this newly formed planet are many elements that were created in that supernova, including those we extract from the earth like tin, copper, gold and many others. One of these elements is the element of uranium. Packed with energy from its creation in a supernova. It's a natural energy source that has been there connecting us to our galaxy for billions of years. The presence of this star power throughout the planet, radiating energy has kept the earth warm since before life began, and still does. In 1896, five thousand years into our recorded history, the Polish born Marie Curie and her French scientist husband, Pierre Curie, along with French engineer Henri Becquerel, discovered the energy releasing property of certain elements like uranium. It's there. They knew then that the whole conception of matter would be changed. That there indeed existed a unique form of matter that was not inert, that was alive with a superpower. Marie Curie named it radioactivity. They could only imagine what this volatile matter could become or later achieve. For this, one of the greatest gifts nature has ever given us - energy in a new form - they received the Nobel Prize. Then, just a few years later, in 1905, independently working in Zurich, Switzerland, the theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein, discovered the astounding truth that in its simplest form, matter is energy waiting to happen and that the earth contains more energy than we ever imagined. Liberating energy from matter was now the new challenge. Scientists then discovered that particles colliding with the uranium atoms sometimes split the uranium into smaller fragments with a large and rapid release of energy. They named this process fission, which could access the stored energy quickly instead of in a slow trickle, as does radioactivity. The physics of fission were first explained by the Austrian, Lise Meitner, in 1938. But unfortunately that year, through a coincidence of history, came on the eve of the biggest war ever. And the first thing people did with this scientific breakthrough was make a bomb. And use it. America's Manhattan Project, born out of World War Two, created the knowledge and fuel to build such a bomb. By packing uranium together densely enough, scientists learned to create a chain reaction. Enrico Fermi and his team, in 1942, created the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in a squash court under the University of Chicago Stadium. The stadium did not blow up, nor the university. They had built a simple device in which a pile of graphite and uranium was filled with cadmium rods that slowed the chain reaction. As the rods were removed one by one, the uranium fission chain reaction began. Remove more rods and the energy increased. Put some rods back in place and it decreased. Thus if a chain reaction could be sustained and accelerated, it would result in a powerful explosion. The good news was that uranium's energy could be controlled. As Fermi had done in Chicago. If controlled, the potential of this new discovery for the benefit of society was beyond measure. The first productive use of that energy was to run submarines and ships. Admiral Hyman Rickover was a poor Jewish immigrant who once admitted to the Naval Academy, never left the Navy. He had the mind of an engineer who seeing the goal clearer than anyone, cut through time and space to make it happen. The idea of solving a problem, building something, creating something drove him all his life. This is the reactor or the atomic pile. There's uranium in here. Rickover built the first nuclear reactor that fit into a submarine hull. The USS Nautilus was inspired in part by Jules Verne's classic 19th century fable Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Exploring our original home in the sea. Nautilus was, in its own way, a fantasy underwater vehicle designed and built by Rickover in just three years between 1952 and '54. It was a magnificent achievement and over the next three decades, Rickover supervised the building of hundreds of reactors all quickly and successfully. The Navy still has one hundred of them operating now. More than sixty years later, the Navy has run this fleet of small floating reactors for a combined six thousand reactor years without a single major nuclear related incident. An aircraft carrier is a 100,000 ton, six thousand person city of steel moving at 35 miles an hour. It's an awesome piece of technology that's being powered by supernova energy. In other words, a mere two reactors so compact that they could fit into a large living room. With just one of these reactors, the submarine can stay submerged for months and thousands of miles. It doesn't need refueling for 25 years. - A fuel pellet the size of my tip of my pinky has as much energy as a ton of coal. The uranium to make that pellet costs a buck or two. A ton of coal costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $100. Huge difference. And nuclear operates so cleanly you can do it underwater with 150 people sealed up in a ship and having their power plant running. Now imagine trying to operate even just a small gasoline engine in a sealed building. It wouldn't take very long before you'd kill everybody. After I went on board submarines, I recognized that all the things that excited me were still there. And technically it was so easy. The secret that nobody wants to tell you, from who serves in the Navy is, the easiest job in the Navy Is being a reactor operator on a submarine. Really? - You don't have to do anything, you're sitting there and everything works and you just sit there. In a major address at the United Nations in front of 3500 delegates from most of the countries of the world, President Eisenhower shared his vision for nuclear technology. This greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a great boon for the benefit of all mankind. Eisenhower proposed that the only way to overcome international conflict was to use nuclear power to produce cheap and massive amounts of electricity. - Experts would be mobilized to apply atomic energy to the needs of agriculture, medicine and other peaceful activities. A special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power starved areas of the world. Thus, the contributing powers would be dedicating some of their strength to serve the needs rather than the fears of mankind. He went on to make probably the most optimistic statement of his eight years in office. The United States pledges before you to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life. The entire assembly of delegates from around the world, including the Soviet Union, responded with warm and sustained applause. Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program was born here. This was a most promising moment for mankind. Fulfilling his pledge to the world and turning to his proven team, Eisenhower asked Admiral Rickover and the Navy to build a nuclear reactor that could generate civilian electricity. Adapting his submarine design, Rickover went at it in his usual way and in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, broke ground in 1954 and began generating in 1958. But here is truly the most wonderful and exciting thing I've ever had the chance to talk about. It's the Westinghouse Total Electric Home, a home where electricity does everything, heats, cools, preserves and prepares foods, entertains. The Cold War was a period of prosperity. The plan was that by the 21st century, the American economy would be mostly nuclear powered with little, if any, air pollution. No climate gases and grids of plentiful, clean electricity criss- crossing the country. New York City was going to be powered by nuclear reactors, the first of which was being built upriver at Indian Point. Carbon emission would drop substantially. You would be in the process of electrifying our entire country. Futurists imagine modern, all-electric cities with electric heat, light and air conditioning in our homes and buildings. Electric trains would replace diesel and new transportation systems would evolve. Westinghouse and General Electric followed in Rickover's tracks and from the late 1960s to the '80s, built almost 100 large reactors. Other countries followed. France embracing the vision of its president, Charles de Gaulle, opened its first nuclear power plant in 1964, at Chinon. And then from 1975 to '90, in response to the escalating price of oil in the crisis of 1973, built 56 reactors in 15 years. Sweden built a dozen reactors on four sites in the '70s and '80s. Six of those plants continue to operate today, producing 30% of Sweden's electricity and most of the rest coming from hydro, wind and biofuels. Sweden during this time cut its carbon emissions by 50%. And contrary to what many critics claimed would be a disaster for its economy, electricity generation more than doubled and its economy actually expanded by 50%. The same is true for Canada, which built 19 reactors of Canadian design, mostly in the industrial heartland of Ontario province, which in those years switched off coal and reduced emissions by 90%. West Germany launched its first commercial reactor in 1969, and by 2010, 22% of the electricity of a reunited Germany came from nuclear. Japan, which imported its first commercial reactor from England in 1966, had five operating reactors going by 1973 and was expanding construction with a major program. By the end of the '70s Japan had become an expert in standardized designs and exporting nuclear to other countries in Asia. But the world's first nuclear power plant to ever produce clean electricity was actually built back in 1954 by the Soviets. The atomic power station has become one of the operating industrial plants of the USSR. The Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant today stands as a museum and a monument to clean energy and the power of the atom. The process of uranium nuclear fission releasing atomic energy takes place in this reactor. Many important world figures visited the plant in operation, including three high level American delegations curious about its usages for industrial production, as well as any signals for use in war. They could find none. But it was a signal from the Soviet Union in the middle of the Cold War, a demonstration of their peaceful intentions. Especially after Eisenhower's speech asking for a shared nuclear knowhow for the benefit of all mankind. Atoms are working for peace. This mid-century dream of a fuel efficient world run by clean atomic energy, without fossil fuels. It was all within our grasp. So what happened to this promising moment? Eisenhower's 1953 vision of Atoms for Peace was a mortal threat to the rich and powerful coal and oil industries, and they were ready to challenge nuclear energy from the beginning. The giant oil companies nicknamed the Seven Sisters straddling all the world's markets since early in the century, spent a great deal of money to present themselves as necessary to our prosperity. America's iconic oil family, the Rockefellers, through their foundation, set about promoting the idea that low level radiation harms human health. And so they set up a committee to study the biological effects of atomic radiation and kind of put their thumb on the scale for what the committee's results would be. And then they took one of the directors from the Rockefeller Foundation, a guy named Warren Weaver, was put in charge of this genetics committee. And, not surprising to me, the report from the Genetics Committee came out on June 12th, 1956, and said radiation all the way down to a single gamma ray was hazardous to your health. The Rockefeller Foundation included the publisher of The New York Times, Arthur Sulzberger. So if they wanted to help sway public opinion, they didn't need to buy ads necessarily. They just helped get a particular point of view published. The resulting fear of low level radiation, which has never garnered evidence to justify it, began to erode the optimism around this new industry. The Sierra Club promoted nuclear power before it opposed it. The club was an old organization founded in 1892, primarily devoted to hiking, climbing and exploring nature. Will Siri, a biophysicist from Berkeley, an experienced mountaineer and a veteran of Oppenheimer's Manhattan Project, had been influential in conserving the California redwoods and the Grand Canyon. Like many early conservationists, he strongly favored nuclear energy and arranged for the club's blessing to the opening of California's Diablo Canyon reactor in San Luis Obispo, in 1966. Twice the club membership voted to support the action. Siri said at the time: - Nuclear power is one of the chief long term hopes for conservation. Ansel Adams, the club's legendary photographer and board member, said nuclear was the only practical alternative that we have to destroying the environment with oil and coal. They spent a lot of time in their early years fighting against dams that would fill up valleys full of water. The Sierra Club used to have a campaign called Atoms, not Dams! under David Brower. And then David Brower left the Sierra Club in a huff and founded Friends of the Earth. And I'd known Friends of the Earth was a big anti-nuclear organization, but then I found out where David Brower got his first check, $200,000 from Robert Anderson, who was the CEO of Arco. He wrote the first check to David Brower, who was founding a environmentalist organization specifically to fight nuclear energy. So why would an oil guy fund Friends of the Earth? Makes sense to me. And it's not conspiracy, it's simply business. Soon Brouwer's faction regained power in the Sierra Club and switched its position. Other groups sprang up as well, notably Greenpeace in 1971, in Vancouver, Canada. Along with issues like saving the whales, it fuzed a peace position on nuclear disarmament with an environmental position on opposing nuclear energy. - We lumped nuclear energy in with nuclear weapons as if all things nuclear were evil. This was a mistake. We got a lot of things right, stop the bombs, save the whales, stop toxic waste, etcetera. But we made that one serious error. The new battleground was Ohio, where new reactors were to be built instead of coal plants. The environmental groups hired lobbyists and filed lawsuits. The young attorney, Ralph Nader, who gained the public's trust in the mid '60s with his criticism of the safety of American cars, joined the cause and now helped turn the public against nuclear power. If we stop nuclear power, or shall we say when we stop nuclear power, we will usher in throughout the United States and the world, a new energy alternative. The sun. The sun, which Exxon doesn't like because it's free, it's abundant, it can bypass Exxon. Stopping atomic energy is saving this country. He wildly exaggerated the dangers from radioactivity, saying a nuclear accident could wipe out Cleveland and the survivors would envy the dead. Six of the eight Ohio reactors planned were closed, including one canceled in 1975 when it was 97% complete. It was then turned into a coal plant. To this day, two thirds of Ohio electricity is powered by dirty coal, which alone kills about half a million people worldwide per year and sickens millions more with horrible effects such as cancer, emphysema and heart disease. - If you want to accuse us of having raised the cost of building new nuclear plants by demanding more regulation, I plead guilty. In 1979, there were 72 commercial reactors in the US. Early this morning at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania... But then came Three Mile Island. The reactor overheated and partially melted down. But the containment structure prevented radiation from affecting the surroundings. There was no apparent serious contamination of workers. But the accident in 1979 was a gift to the anti-nuclear movement that would lead to a halt in the building of any more nuclear reactors. Later that year, a star studded cast of musicians put on five nights of No Nukes concerts at Madison Square Garden. Followed by a rally on Battery Park landfill attended by 200,000 people. Along with Ralph Nader and other stars, Jane Fonda spoke. The money that is being raised is going to support all of the local anti-nuclear groups around the country and I want to express my gratitude and I know you feel the same way. She followed up with a 32 day, 50 city tour to spread the gospel and raise a good deal of money For the environmental groups, stopping nuclear power was now glamorous, virtuous and lucrative all at once. And they had a friend in President Jimmy Carter, who promoted energy conservation and installed solar panels on the White House while downgrading nuclear energy below coal on his list of priorities. It does now seem likely that sometime in the last couple of days there's been perhaps the worst accident in the short history of the world's nuclear power industry. But the fact that they have had to reveal it and admit that there are casualties suggests they're deeply worried about the scale of it. When Chernobyl in the Ukraine, part of the Soviet Union, struck, it deeply shook the public's faith in nuclear. It was just what the environmentalists had feared and predicted. But what happened exactly? There's no question the reactor was poorly designed and lacked a containment structure to keep radiation from leaking out into the environment. The operators carried out a risky experiment that led to a meltdown which was very badly handled by the bureaucracy of what was then an empire in decay, the Soviet Union, which tried to keep it secret. This allowed low level radiation to spread across northern Europe before the government finally admitted the problem. They sent in first responders with inadequate protective gear to get the fire under control. These men were exposed to massive doses of radiation. Vladimir Asmolov was a scientist in charge of the investigation. As he spoke, I saw he was haunted by the event. Yeah, it was a big responsibility, but you're not responsible for the explosion. You were in charge of the cleanup. He thought the highly successful HBO series was a fiction, that the real scientists were professional and that there was no conflict with the government or the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the United Nations and World Health Organization, about 50 people died from radiation at the reactor. And possibly 4000 from cancers over the long term in areas downwind. That's a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of deaths every year from generating electricity with coal. Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear power accident in history, was far less deadly than many industrial tragedies. In 1984, a Union Carbide accident in Bhopal, India, where a chemical gas leaked, killed 15 to 20 thousand people and injured half a million more. The 1975 collapse of a hydroelectric dam in China killed roughly 200 thousand people. Outdoor air pollution kills an estimated four million people a year. Industrial accidents and disease, roughly two million. Nuclear's death toll, all from Chernobyl is at most in the low thousands, which is a very tiny fraction of fossil fuel deaths. By the early '90s, activist anti-nuclear groups were on fire, calling for no compromise on the bottom line that nuclear power must be eliminated and that any amount of radiation, even if below the normal background levels, had to be treated as a risk to human health. Every new nuclear related project, from mining to transport to construction operation and decommissioning, was now facing a series of legal, political and economic obstacles that would stall any further progress. The supposed death knell for the industry finally happened 25 years after Chernobyl in Fukushima, Japan in 2011. It was the second largest accident in nuclear history. It happened when the biggest earthquake Japan ever suffered created a tsunami one hundred feet tall. The earthquake and the tsunami killed about 18,000 people, but it had nothing to do with nuclear power. All the nuclear plants in the tsunami's path, with one exception, avoided serious damage. But the plant at Fukushima, like Chernobyl's, was poorly designed. Not the reactor but the site design. It had too low a seawall, less than twenty feet and all back up generators were located on low ground where they flooded. The plant lost electricity. The core melted down. Hydrogen gas built up and exploded inside the building and radiation was released into the air. But the authorities, unlike at Chernobyl, did not send in unprotected people to fight the highly radioactive fire, and the public never received more than low level harmless radiation. Fukushima might be the only disaster in history widely called a nuclear disaster by almost everyone with a death toll of zero from nuclear. More than six hundred died from the badly managed forced evacuation such as when patients were abruptly yanked out of hospitals. But the actual disaster was the tsunami with its 18,000 victims. Nonetheless, Japan reacted in panic, closing down all its nuclear plants, whether affected by the earthquake or not and the country remained frozen with doubt. In 2021, ten years after the accident, only ten of Japan's 33 operable reactors were in use. Imported fossil fuels replaced the rest. The negativity of world opinion resulting from both Chernobyl and Fukushima now reached a critical mass. Germany took the most severe course and under significant political pressure from the Green Party began phasing out all 17 of its nuclear reactors. While continuing to rely on coal plants. Even in Sweden, winds were blowing against nuclear. The new government that included the Green Party dramatically raised anti-nuclear taxes, which led to the premature retirement of four reactors. South Korea had a well trained generation of engineers and scientists and a standardized design and had been generating electricity at a very low price when it decided to pull back. The heavily publicized 2016 feature, Pandora, which pictured an accident far worse than the actual Fukushima, grabbed and swayed public opinion against nuclear and the government stopped construction on new plants. The trend of politicians around most developed countries of shutting down well working nuclear reactors met little political opposition. And it became far easier to approve a new methane gas power plant or a new coal plant. And without forward movement, the US nuclear industry was slowly declining as well. With existing plants being shut down early, including Indian Point, which supplied 25% of New York City's electricity for many years. And the planned closing of Diablo Canyon, California's last remaining nuclear power plant. Although in 2022, this was reversed after a fierce battle. - I now believe that nuclear is vital to our future on this planet, and I've helped start a group called Mothers for Nuclear to help explain why. These reactors have operated safely and reliably for decades, producing about 9% of California's electricity in recent years. There are still a number of nuclear reactors working in the United States today. These legacy reactors, more than 30 or 40 years later, still supply 20% of US electricity. Working 24/7 without oil spills, gas leaks or coal pollution. They have become so uneventful, it's easy to forget they even exist. Many people to this day still think that these plants are capable of blowing up like a nuclear bomb. But that's physically impossible because their uranium is not sufficiently enriched in any way close to the necessary amount. The idea that low levels of radiation are dangerous right down to near zero is a contamination phobia. Which when you think it through, is kind of ridiculous. We've evolved, after all, on a planet filled with uranium and bombarded by both sunlight and cosmic rays. Our bodies are built by nature and evolution to handle small amounts of radiation. Medical procedures such as dentistry account for about one third of the radiation from which humans are exposed. The other two thirds being natural background radiation. This low level background radiation doubles if you live at altitude in Denver, Colorado. Or triples if you work on a long distance airline crew or if you smoke a pack of cigarettes each day. The FDA sets a radiation dose limit for diagnostic procedures. Radioactive iodine treatment of thyroid cancer delivers one hundred thousand millisieverts to the thyroid and 200 millisieverts as a whole body dose. Granite contains some uranium and you get extra radiation if you live near a mountain or work in a building like the US Capitol. And it's far higher in Ramsar, Iran with its radium hot springs or the black sand beaches of Brazil where people bury themselves in the sand to get what they consider a healthy dose. High levels of radiation are dangerous for sure. People died and got very sick from exposure in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and at Chernobyl. But there is no basis for the public perception that the offspring from these survivors had an increased rate of genetic defects. Massive and careful long term studies do not support these conceptions. Fears of passing down horrible mutations like the three eyed fish in The Simpsons are without foundation. So what kind of audience do you get and what kind of feedback? - On Tik Tok it's mostly 18 to 25 year old females, which is unheard of for science communicators. A single one of my videos can get something like 500,000 views, and that's 500,000 people that didn't know anything about nuclear power, but now do and might have changed their minds. - What are some of the things young girls say? - Some things like, I used to think that millions of people died when Chernobyl happened, so there are a lot of people changing their minds around that and nuclear waste as well. The nuclear industry is the only energy generating industry that's actually responsible for its waste because it is radioactive, and so as soon as it comes out of the plant, it's handled by the industry. - We have a highly rigorous process to manage the waste coming from a nuclear plant, and we can tell you exactly where every bit of waste is from every nuclear plant that is operated. It's contained, it's located on sites that are protected. We can't say the same for many other energy resources where waste goes up in the air or we have piles of tailings from those materials. And I hesitate to call it waste a lot of times because it's really just used fuel. - Not a single person anywhere in the world has ever been harmed by used nuclear fuel. What many don't know is that if we brought together all of America's spent fuel from sixty years of powering 20% of our electricity, it would be the size of a Walmart. Sixty years, 20% of our electricity would be the size of a Walmart. There is nothing uniquely dangerous about radioactive materials. They're just one of many industrial materials that can be toxic and must be handled carefully. The US solution for now is dry cask cylinders 18ft high made of concrete and steel that keep radiation contained and are not damaged by things like earthquakes. Concrete absorbs radiation. The government hopes to use the spent fuel someday to power new reactor types. Or it can, like their military has been doing for years, safely bury the waste underground because radioactive materials actually lose potency over time. Finland is already building a permanent storage site for spent fuel in bedrock deep underground, sealed in copper canisters and backfilled with clay. Sweden plans to use the same design. Two billion years ago in Gabon, in Africa, there were natural nuclear reactors, meaning in these uranium mines in Africa, water would pull around the uranium and that would create a chain reaction. And so these reactors operated for hundreds of thousands of years, and they left behind what we call nuclear waste fission products. And just by analyzing where these fission products are in the area, scientists actually know that nuclear waste doesn't move very far, even in a scale of hundreds of thousands of years, or in this case, two billion years. Hey guys, so a lot of you have been asking about my makeup routine. The most important thing is to make sure you wash your face really well, because we want those pores as clean as we want our electricity. And the best way to get that is to use this cleanser called Stop Shutting Down Nuclear Plants, for Christ's Sake. It's carbon free, emission free, pollution free electricity. The answer to solving climate change is very straightforward. We have the solutions. We just have to implement them. You know, the first question is, But isn't it too dangerous? What about the waste? Nuclear waste is nothing compared to climate change. In 2006, the film An Inconvenient Truth, produced by former Vice President Al Gore, dramatized vividly the dangers of carbon emissions and overheating the planet. Look how far above the natural cycle this is, and we've done that. And the Oscar goes to An Inconvenient Truth. It opened with a worldwide impact and won a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. In the years that followed, the issue of climate change became even more polarized, with conservatives holding on to their position that this was not an extraordinary event created by mankind. - Climate change is not science. It's religion. In 2017, President Trump, despising tree huggers and liberals, pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord and called climate change a hoax. At the other extreme, environmentalists and activists were folding the issue of climate change into a wider agenda of ending capitalism and globalization, bringing to the forefront inequality. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? But most people were in the middle, confused by the claims but scared by the changes they were seeing so vividly in the weather, oceans and animal kingdom. People wanted not partizan or ideological solutions, but practical ones. One solution that gained momentum during this time was clean energy in the form of renewables. Global investment in renewables reached close to three trillion dollars. Costs dropped by 80% for solar and 50% for wind. A giant step. Together wind and solar grew from about 2% to 10% of world electricity generation. Hydroelectric power, the biggest of the renewables, expanded across Southeast Asia and elsewhere. But despite the massive effort and the optimism, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, stated in 2018 and again more strongly in 2021 that if we didn't cut carbon emissions by nearly 100% in less than 30 years, by 2050, the world would suffer serious damage to ecosystems and economies. There'd be mega changes like the melting of polar ice sheets, the sea level rise. Coastal cities might become uninhabitable. There'd be an increase in frequency and size of extreme weather events, forest fires, droughts, terrible heat waves, and unusually strong hurricanes. Ominously, the predictions from the 1980s are proving to be accurate because we're still depending on fossil fuels and we're in the same place we were at the turn of the century. How can that be? We have put such effort and money into renewables, yet we burn more fossil fuels than ever. To understand how this happened, Germany is a good case in point. No nation has done more to promote green power in the last 20 years and received a great deal of favorable publicity. Germany made the fateful decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022. We won't support even a one second extension for an energy form that we can't fully control. Replacing it with roughly the same amount of electricity using renewable power instead. How did that work out? Germany's largest solar plant with 465 thousand panels, was built on 500 acres. The nuclear plant, which was recently closed, was built on about 100 acres. It operated around the clock, all seasons, all weather, on average, producing at near 90% of its peak. The average for the solar plant has been about 11% of its peak because most of the time it's either night, winter or cloudy. So the reality is that a nuclear plant produces almost 100 times the electricity per year as a solar plant and can do so on one fifth the land. Germany also built about thirty thousand wind turbines, some of the newer ones almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower. Wind has worked for Germany, producing twice as much electricity as solar. But it still averages less than a quarter of its peak capacity. To equal the same amount of nuclear power would require four thousand giant turbines spread over many square kilometers and would still depend on the weather. One way to make wind and solar more efficient when weather is a factor is to store some of their power in batteries. Their prices are dropping quickly and there's an intense race going on. China at this point is far in a lead, producing more than 70% of all battery cells. Still, despite the promise of bigger and better batteries, Bill Gates, who's invested one billion dollars in renewables, has said there's no battery technology that's even close to allowing us to take all of our energy from renewables. It'll be a lot of renewables. And either a storage miracle or are quite a bit of nuclear. The problem is scale. What works for a phone or a car doesn't work for a city or a continent. Germany doesn't have the natural hydroelectric potential like Norway or New Zealand, and most of the great hydro sites in the world are already dammed, leaving little upside in development. And geothermal energy, such as it exists in Iceland is unproven outside of limited volcanic locations. Which leaves biomass the burning of organic material. Germany cuts down and burns forests in Europe and North America with a similar result as fossil fuel pollution. And yet it's called renewable energy, because in theory, new trees grow back when you cut the old ones down. But it takes decades for the new trees to grow back. The mathematics simply do not add up. All of these renewables combined are not enough to provide Germany's demand for energy, so it still has to burn coal. A more economical solution is natural gas, also known as methane gas. Which is widely available, especially since the fracking revolution. Is this a solution? - Methane gas is less polluting than coal, that's true. Half the CO2. But that's still putting CO2 in and every time you light a methane fire, you're putting CO2 into the atmosphere, and then the dirty secret of it is it leaks out all along the line. Although it's invisible to the eye, methane can be seen by infrared cameras, which reveal that it severely pollutes the atmosphere when it leaks and escapes unburned. - If you take a methane gas detector and go around, you'll find that there's gas pipelines everywhere under our streets, your gas stove, you turn it on goes, click, click, click and then it lights. That's unburned methane. And when that stuff gets into the atmosphere, it's 80 times worse for global warming than CO2. And it doesn't last as long as CO2 but in the immediate, the next few decades, it's a major problem. Methane levels are going way up in the atmosphere and it's definitely contributing a lot to climate change. It's no wonder that publicly oil and gas companies fully support renewables and lobby for subsidies. They tell us natural gas is the perfect partner for renewables, but it's a false solution. In the last 30 years, renewables have been going in on top of fossil fuels, not replacing them. And that's why the overall proportion of clean, renewable energy hasn't changed. Sadly, more than 80% of energy use is still fossil fuel. Altogether Germany has spent over $200 billion on renewables since 2013. But within Europe, Germany has the highest electricity prices and their carbon emissions are among the highest. This energy indecision is not just a European phenomenon, but is something that is affecting many countries on a global scale. India with well over a billion people, represents another crucial participant in our world community. Demand for air conditioning alone in India and other hot countries is projected to triple by 2050 worldwide. India has made tremendous gains in solar power and is planning to build at large scale very cheaply. It is a new technology trained workforce. Its solar power has become cheaper than coal, and wind has become cost competitive. Both energies are still weather dependent. India has ventured into nuclear power with 23 reactors on line seven under construction and more planned. And Indian consumers sick of the deadly pollution in their cities may well push the government to accelerate these kinds of clean energy initiatives. But India is a democracy, and if you don't give people what they want, which is cheap electricity, you'll be voted out of office. So the Indian government says that for the foreseeable future, 75% of their electricity will be from coal. In Russia, there is also some indecision about their energy future. It has a lot of cheap methane gas, which can supply electricity and can be exported successfully to other countries, though at the cost of accelerating climate change. But Russia has a significant nuclear program as their government agency, Rosatom, employs some quarter million engineers, researchers and employees. Global warming, which is caused by CO2 emission, is something which is very painfully felt here in Russia because a big chunk of Russia's territory is located closer to the north. This is why we actually feel all these variations in temperature. So I'll give you an example, Mr. Stone. Currently in the world there is 490 gigawatts of installed nuclear capacity. If we replace this with gas or oil power generation, that would cause emission of more than two billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. So nuclear industry is in fact an extra lung that our world has. Well said. An extra lung. When it joined the World Trade Organization on favorable terms in 2001, China became the world's workshop. Incomes rose for hundreds of millions of people. And with agricultural and computer progress, the expectations of people in general brightened. But the worm in the apple was that as the West moved much of its manufacturing to China, more and more coal was burned. Half of the world's coal is now burned in China. The poster child of this shift was the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge built by China. Its pieces then shipped over and put together in the Bay Area in 2013. California brags that it doesn't burn coal. It's a nice and clean state, when China burns the coal for California. China has a major decision to make which will impact all our futures. Does it modernize or does it continue down the path of coal? China's emissions combined with the United States make up almost half of the world's total. The key to decarbonization lies in these two countries who ideally should be partners in this global issue. What's scary is not the same as what's dangerous. Coal is dangerous. It kills millions of people every year. More people die from coal in a couple of weeks than have ever died from nuclear, which is all from the one accident in Chernobyl. People are scared of flying because it's dramatic. If a plane crashes, you know you're going to die. I'd say severe turbulence, definitely severe turbulence. And they can't get that image out of their mind, But actually, driving is far more dangerous than flying. And in the same way, a nuclear accident because of all this hype around nuclear power scares people. But actually it's orders of magnitude safer than fossil fuel, especially coal. It's as though you're on a bridge and a train is coming onto the bridge. Train! And the train coming at you is climate change. Shit. And what we're doing is trying to run off the bridge away from the train, but we don't have time to get off the bridge. That's our renewables, that's our personal carbon footprint, all the little things that we're supposed to do. But it's not working and the thing that we have that we know works is to jump off the bridge into the water below, and that's nuclear power. The jump is scary, but it's the train that's going to kill you. Many in the West's post-industrial lifestyle feel they're taking steps in the right direction. And they are. People preach the green gospel. They recycle, they install solar panels and look for sustainability in their consumer brands. Turn out the lights, drive more efficient cars, reduce your carbon footprint. We do things that are politically doable, affordable, convenient, and make us feel good about being virtuous, better citizens. And we all hope somewhat blindly that these things will add up. But they don't. So what do we need to do? How do we solve this problem in a better way than just trying to add up things that don't get to a solution? The answer is to think objectively, top down from the future, Back to now and be very honest. Where do we actually need to be in 2050 to solve carbon emissions? And working backwards from there, what steps can we take to get to that solution? One place to start is to include everyone in our thinking, not only the billion people living in the richer parts of the world but the 7 billion who don't. And are now producing two thirds of carbon emissions. Seven hundred million of whom don't have any access to electricity. Did the West think the populations of China, Africa, India, South America and the Middle East wouldn't want what we have? Electricity in their homes, cars, computers, air conditioners, modernized agriculture? Or at a more basic level, if your destiny is to grind sugarcane by hand in India, that destiny can be hugely transformed by an electric grinder. That's why poorer countries are building electricity generation as fast as they can, and they're using the cheapest, fastest, simplest technology they can find. Coal. Can the West now seriously tell billions of people they can't enjoy a life changing event like electricity? Because we've already burned up most of the carbon the planet can afford? Did we think these populations would use less energy than we did? And the truth be fully known, it's not just electricity we need. That's only a third of the total, because two thirds of the energy related carbon dioxide emissions come from non-electric sources. That is most transportation, including cars, trucks, trains, ships and planes. Secondly, industries such as steel, cement and fertilizer. And thirdly, the heating of homes, offices and all buildings which are not yet electrified. And just to get these sectors off the coal, oil and gas they depend on, they need to be electrified, which will enormously multiply demand for clean electricity. The resulting volume of carbon free electricity needed over the next thirty years is almost unimaginable. It depends on several factors, but realistic estimates range from two to four times the electricity we currently use. The world is not standing still as this is going on. All these economies are growing fast month by month, year by year. We're going to need a gigantic amount of clean electricity by 2050. Two, three, maybe four times all the electricity we use now. And it has to be cheap enough to outcompete coal and gas and also scalable, able to be built in large quantities and at quicker speed. Realism dictates that renewables aren't going to be able to bridge this energy gap. And we don't have much time till 2050 to switch over an extremely large system. So it becomes apparent for the sake of humanity that we must seriously reconsider nuclear energy. At present, more than four hundred reactors are producing over 10% of the world's electricity. Dozens of countries are building more right now, about fifty reactors in 16 countries, notably in China India and Russia. And another hundred are on order. Most of these in Eurasia, with its rapidly rising electricity demand. Turkey, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates are newcomers to the game. President Xi Jinping surprisingly suddenly announced in 2020 to the United Nations that China intended to drop its carbon emissions to zero by 2060. This is a huge commitment. But can China deliver? They have 37 nuclear reactors and are building 19 more, which is faster than anyone else. They hook a new reactor to the grid every two to three months. Having adapted American, Russian, Canadian and French designs over the years, the Chinese now have their own design. The Hualong One, which took about five years to build and is now in operation. These are inexpensive, heavy workhorse reactors that can be built by the tens, maybe by the hundreds. China also is building the Linglong One, a low cost small modular reactor called an SMR, a technology first deployed by the Russians. It's about one third the size of the Hualong One and can be built in a factory and either sited on land or barged to locations around the world and plugged in. Whether China's standardizes and replicates its big reactors or small ones, we will be investing deeply in the future of this century. These reactors are going to last fifty to eighty years or more. There's no question the cost of building nuclear plants, though dropping, is still huge. The positive side is they're inexpensive to operate. And once the pattern of building is established successfully, reactors could conceivably be built like airliners or giant turbines on a factory scale at a central location. The first fully functional SMR has already been successfully deployed in Russia in a remote but important Arctic port town, Pevek. Built in the Saint Petersburg shipyards, the plant was barged to the Arctic. Greenpeace called it a nuclear Titanic. But it dodged the icebergs, arrived in a new home, plugged into both the grid and the district heating system for the town's buildings, and in 2020 was powering the town without a problem. Similar to the United States, Russia is operating 35 reactors accounting for almost 20% of its electricity. But unlike the United States, Russia is building a new reactor each year to replace retirements and raise the nuclear share of electricity to what they plan, if they stick to it, 50% by mid-century and 75% by century's end. Russia with 60% of the market is the world's leader in exporting larger reactors specializing in turnkey plants that it designs, builds and operates. Dozens of projects are under way in India, China, Bangladesh, Turkey and elsewhere. The most ambitious development in Russia is its fast breeder reactors, which we visited close to the foot of the Ural Mountains. Beloyarsk is a unique facility. It's the only industrial scale fast reactor in the world. In a conventional reactor, uranium fuel gradually degrades, whereas in fast neutron reactor it becomes higher and higher grade. Then you have a capability to recycle the same fuel multiple times. So we operate using the waste from other reactor types. We don't extract resources from the earth. And why do you call it Fast Breeder? - Because we breed, we produce more fuel than we burn. This is the most advanced nuclear reactor in the world. With breeder reactors, no one yet knows if this technology will be cheap enough to standardize and be the complete breakthrough technology. Or perhaps it'll be the model for the next stage and so on. Like any science, nuclear keeps adapting and renewing itself. In 2021, Europe split into pro and anti nuclear camps. The United Kingdom has begun to build again with multiple reactors planned. The Netherlands, Poland and much of Eastern Europe all intend to build new plants in the coming decades. But with its 56 nuclear reactors and more promised, France continues to be the true world leader in clean energy. And when they look at it, they see that the end price for corporations and for households is significantly less in France than it is in all the neighboring countries. We believe that in 2050 mankind has the ability to be a net zero planet or very close to net zero in order for global warming to stop. We need global warming to stop. We believe electricity is the key success factor in managing global warming issues, and we believe there is, there are a lot of solutions and nuclear is a key part of these solutions. Voila. Welcome to the swimming pool. The water is hot, clear France still to this day, runs a clean grid with one third of the carbon emissions per person of the United States. Truly a major accomplishment. This brings us around to the United States still dependent on fossil fuels. 40% gas, 20% coal. Despite tripling output in the last decade, wind power only supplies 8% of the nation's electricity. And solar power, despite its highly publicized fast growth generates only 2 to 3%. But public support for nuclear energy has grown, in fact, to 60% in 2021. I was reading the book about the Wright brothers. You know, they started this as bicycle mechanics, but they wanted to fly and they kept doing it and doing it and doing it. It took forever. They flew twenty feet, thirty feet a minute. It was a long haul, eight, nine years, but they did it and they were the best fliers. Well, it just shows you that tenacity in scientific matters is crucial. And certainly the nuclear industry in the United States has done that as it keeps being counted out. - Counted out for debt in the United States. Never in the world. - That's right. Too good to let it die off. - Yeah. It's too good to let it die off. - Yeah. The spirit of innovation has always defined America's character. And now 50 or more new companies have entered the energy field with creative new designs for nuclear reactors with a focus on SMRs. These new reactors are small, taking up a fraction of the footprint needed for traditional nuclear power reactors. They're modular, making it possible for these designs to be scaled up and factory assembled, and their reactors utilizing the same reliable nuclear fission technology to generate heat to produce electricity. There's two fairly significant projects that are going to be built by the end of 2028. First of all, the partnership between Bill Gates' TerraPower and General Hitachi. It's called the Natrium Facility, and it's going to heat a set of molten salt tanks. The other one of these advanced reactor demonstration projects is by a company called X-energy, initially funded by an entrepreneur from the space program. So we're actually building stuff. And bigger American companies like General Electric are also building new reactors in partnership with Hitachi of Japan. They've designed a most promising, low cost, workhorse, boiling water reactor built in a factory and dropped into a hole on site. The SMR is scheduled for completion by 2028 and then it can be built as a fleet. There are high hopes and demand from the utilities for this potentially breakthrough reactor. China and Russia seem to be the leading explorers in this field. Absolutely. If General Electric's got this kind of thing with a Japanese company called Hitachi, why are we not going all out on this? - Part of the problem is that General Electric has a, it's a very large company with a very small nuclear division. General Electric has a huge business in wind turbines, gas turbines and natural gas drilling equipment. Their priority is a little low in the nuclear range. So perhaps there's an advantage to these new, smaller energy companies. They comprise a whole new generation of young people who are focused primarily on nuclear. And the Department of Energy is working with several of these startups to build prototypes at America's first nuclear test lab, the Idaho National Laboratory. Located on the outskirts of Atomic City, Idaho, and established in 1949, this facility, known as The Site, has provided the space for several organizations to build over 50 reactors to date, including Admiral Rickover's groundbreaking engine for the USS Nautilus. Today, the lab is the epicenter for the next generation of reactors. And you work for the government, right? - So I'm the director of the National Reactor Innovation Center, and that's also called NRIC for short. Enric is charged with accelerating the demonstration of advanced reactor technologies in partnership with private industry. So what are we going to do about the climate? What's the best solution in your mind? - I think that it's straightforward to get to the first 30% renewables and then probably 50 and even greater. But when we get to higher levels of deep decarbonization, we really find that we need firm, low carbon resources to have the most affordable decarbonization. - And that would be? - Largely nuclear. Where the United States excels most is in innovation. And the Department of Energy has made an enormous investment in advanced reactor demonstration projects. And my organization is working closely with the companies who are pursuing those designs. Our vision is that we help demonstrate at least two advanced reactors by the end of 2025. We need nuclear energy to address climate change, and nuclear energy is one of the safest forms of energy that we have. - On Capitol Hill, do they care about that? - There is growing bipartisan support for advanced nuclear. More so than there has been for the traditional technologies. But there's a large audience that we haven't reached yet. And my view is that we need advanced technologies because if we're going to have nuclear meaningfully addressing climate change, it needs to scale globally in a really big way. I mean, in the United States, our electricity demand is fairly stagnant, but that is not true globally. Globally, it's skyrocketing and we have to provide clean, affordable energy to the world. - That's a good point. India, China. - Africa and the Middle East. - Africa. - Yeah. All growing very rapidly. The other thing that we can look at is what is the alternative? And if the alternative is climate change, that is a much more serious risk. - We need to do nuclear differently. And this is where we're going to build our first reactor. You're going to build the reactor here? - We're going to build the reactor here. - Do you know where? - Yeah. Basically out in there. Pretty neat, right? Because this is the first advanced reactor that's going to be a commercial plant that gets built in the United States. And it's a micro reactor, which is different. You know, it's a lot smaller than what we have today. It starts at one and a half megawatts electric. - So that's going to light up how many homes? - It's like a thousand homes. - A thousand homes? - Yeah. Really well suited for, you know, small towns, small communities. - But you're going to build a micro reactor and it's going to give you 1.5MW? That's nothing compared to some of the SMRs. - Exactly. - You know, if we start with something so small, then we can really meet the regulations, but do it efficiently and quickly. A big problem with nuclear is maybe it takes a decade and billions of dollars. We want to show that it can take a couple of years and less money while still meeting the same regulations. - Is it your money or how does that work? - We're a privately funded company. It is our money. - Can I ask you roughly how much you've spent? - Yeah, less than ten million dollars to date. - So you've raised ten million, less than ten million? - It's like Shark Tank. - Yeah, kind of. - We've talked a lot about how we're starting small, and so that's where the aurora comes in at one and one half megawatts. And that provides a platform on which we can scale, because what's next for us is something that's on the order of about 15 megawatts And from that we can go all the way up, potentially up to a hundred or more. And you would run the plant? - We'll run it. By making it sort of a simpler process where we're selling the power and the heat and not the reactors, that makes it easier to buy. - So the utility company you'd cut out? How does that work? - We see the utilities mostly evolving to wanting to run distribution and transmission. We act as an independent power producer and we just sell the power to the local utilities or into the market, and then they can then distribute it to the customers. - Yeah, we're excited about how that could allow communities to basically opt in instead of feeling like a huge plant is being stuck in their backyard. - Do you sometimes feel frustrated that, you know all this, it just goes so slow and you're getting older? - Yeah. - Absolutely. - Timescales are just so long in nuclear and too slow. We're doing everything we can to change that. I think another way of looking at it, if nuclear was just discovered, like in the last 15 years, people would have become a lot more familiar with and comfortable with the technology because then once you understand it, people have a better sense of not being afraid and they see the benefits. We would probably have a thousand nuclear power plants built around the world. That's a good point. - One of the last public speeches JFK even gave was saying we need to use fission to help with conservation and for clean power for various reasons. And it was overshadowed by the weapons. And I think we're looking at it anew because of the imperative climate change. - Younger people seem more open to it. - I think so, yeah. - They're smarter. - I think for the younger generations, climate change is more of an imperative - than worrying about nuclear war. - Exactly, yeah. Well Jake, Caroline, I wish you all the freaking luck in the world, I really do. Really, and the wind at your back. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you, appreciate that. If micro reactors work the way Jake and Caroline say, the industry would gather momentum quickly in the 2030s. And it's not hard to imagine micro reactors in the future having the high end cachet of a nuclear battery buried away in the basement of a smart home. Putting out the power to run lights, heat, water purification, as well as perhaps a small hydroponic indoor farm, all with zero emission. And not much maintenance required for twenty years, after which the reactor is replaced with a fresh battery. - When you have nuclear fission, the primary output is heat. - Thermal energy. - Right. - We typically convert that to electricity. We could use that heat for water purification. We might look at desalination producing clean potable water from seawater or brackish groundwater. Metals, refining, fertilizer production, cement production. Those require a lot of heat. And that heat comes off our reactors, for example, almost for free because it's heat that we can't convert into electricity. So instead of just dumping it to the air, we could use that in district heating or industrial heating or different things like, for example, heating a campus, right, or heating a hospital or heating a big commercial district. You could have reactors heating the district heating that we have in New York City and it'd be completely clean. This is where we're using high temperature steam electrolysis. That means simply breaking down water molecules. Hydrogen is a highly versatile energy carrier that can also be used to produce synthetic fuels. We take that hydrogen from a clean process, and we combine that with carbon dioxide that maybe has been captured from a fossil plant, an ethanol plant, or even directly from the air. And we can combine that carbon dioxide with the hydrogen to produce liquid transportation fuels that are clean burning. - To fly a plane? - Yes. So now we have a pathway of using clean non emitting nuclear energy to produce hydrogen that goes all the way to liquid fuels for your car, for heavy transport vehicles or even aviation. - Wow. Shannon went on to explain how hydrogen is the beginning pathway to many other solutions. Scientists at the Idaho lab are also working on fusion energy, an even more powerful way of harnessing energy from matter. Fusion, which is created when two lightweight atoms are forced together, can produce immense amounts of energy. It is the same process that powers our sun. Its fuel source, hydrogen and lithium are plentiful, and after decades of research, the goal is closer but still elusive. Several start ups think they can reach commercial scale fusion faster and smaller within a decade, and they've raised billions of dollars in investment in 2021. If humanity ever makes fusion practical and economical, it could power the world of the future, maybe even in the second half of this century. Now, we've done some really fantastic development here at this site. Are you moving fast enough? I think that energy in general, we need to move faster. Why do we do this? We do this for our families. We do this for our kids and those generations. It's so important that we look to our energy resources and use them wisely. We're leaving a legacy, and I hope it's a positive one. As I left the lab, it became clearer than ever to me that to hit the needed levels of clean energy, we need to think big. Among other things, we will shortly need to stamp nuclear reactors off assembly lines on the scale of world jetliner production. This would mean creating a significant new worldwide industry, redeploying hundreds of thousands of people of all skills. It would mean in the first years, 2020 to 2030, building factories around the world, then scaling up in the middle years 2030 to 2040 as electrification takes over across the world and multiplies the demand for electricity. And then going all out with everything we have in the remaining years of 2040 to 2050. To do that, we need to rekindle the spirit of Hyman Rickover with the urgency he had to quickly build new things. How much faster could it go if we also imagine a world where countries cooperate to do this? One partnership here on Earth. A United Nations of clean energy. No question the world is changing and far faster than I ever imagined. The future is coming. And I thought, wow, as little as I know, I know there's no real limit to where clean energy can take us. But the other part of conservation is the newer part. And that is to use science and technology to achieve significant breakthroughs as we are doing today, and in that way, to conserve the resources which ten or 20 or 30 years ago may have been wholly unknown. So we use nuclear power for peaceful purposes and power. A formidable energy gave birth to our planet and that energy, through centuries of war, peace cataclysms, the price of potatoes and stocks. All the history, blunders, tragic comedies, and the occasional triumphs. That energy E equals MC squared was always there for us all along. And it's still there, like an inner voice. Our most faithful companion. Why are we not using that power? If this buildout were to occur, can we imagine a world in which human beings are not terrified by climate change but are smart and confident enough to solve it? Together, collectively, we're combating viruses. Exploring inner worlds, oceans and fellow travelers. We're traveling through space and for that matter, just building bullet trains, housing, deep underground tunnels and giant aeropolises. We can do most anything with our mind. Human ingenuity, the workings of the mind can get us out of our climate predicament. Unless we dull it with fear, the mind is the most powerful tool we know. It is more imaginative than any computer will ever be. There is no force, no energy that can contain or stop human consciousness. We may have come to a point in time when Earth is asking us, do you know what you're doing? And there's no going back or forward from this moment. Time stops now. Or maybe I'm being melodramatic, but I think as a race, we're more informed and conscious than we've ever been. And many of us are thinking the same thing. We're thinking not just about ourselves, but of the entire world as we know it and how we can fix it. And that's a hell of a lot of consciousness for many, many people. And for that reason, let's make something of it. If we human beings can get this right, if we can create clean electricity fast enough to decarbonize the world and we can. The effects would be incredible. People would know. They would sense the changes right away and it would energize the world anew. Imagine that. Imagine that there is a tomorrow and it can be better. If we overcome our fears and embrace the primordial star power in the nucleus of the atom, and in doing so, give us all, all living beings what is our birthright. A future that we can look forward to. We are all time travelers. Turning together into the future. But let us work together to make that future a place we want to visit. Be brave, Be determined. Overcome the odds. It can be done. It can be done.
