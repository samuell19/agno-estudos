Excited, Pete? About what? Why, about the fact that you're gonna be one of the biggest men in the country tonight. -Think so? -Think so?! After twenty-five years of running the underworld, Benny Costain, the most powerful and feared man in the country today, is gonna be waded into by one Pete Tonelli. You got any idea what Mr Costain does to... people who try things like this? He's not gonna be around to do anything after you get on the stand, Pete. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe I'm gonna be on the stand. Why, sure you are, Pete. You're gonna get on the stand. Now, we'll see to it that nothin' happens to ya after you do. We sure will. (GUNSHOTS) Oh, now, look, kid, it isn't so bad. See if you can't think of this joint as a sort of a training ground for future life. 'Course, training for what beats me. But I never been in prison before. Half the time, I don't know what they're talkin' about. Because I don't know, | do something wrong. Then they yell at me as if I was stupid or somethin'. Okay, kid, SO NOW You can relax, 'cause you finally get the first break you've had -since they dragged ya into this trap. -Break? Certainly. They turned you over to me, didn't they? | just happen to know more about this joint than those grafters that built it. Yeah, but I don't. Okay, so you don't. So I'm gonna tell you. Certain things in the beginning's more important to know than others. And other things is even more important than that. And one of the most important things in this place is "don't volunteer for nothin™. -Don't volunteer? -Now, remember that. Whenever they come around, waggin' their tails, and trying to act all warm and friendly like about some extra work that's gotta be done, you don't do nothin'. You just sit there, like a hunk of wet wash, and don't volunteer. Why not? Well, why should you help the very jerks out that's keepin' ya here, for one thing? And don't ever do one bit more than just exactly what you're told to do. But how do you get around 'em? Okay. Supposin' they come to me, and they say, "Conley, on this floor there's a spot.” Do I go ahead and wet-mop from here to extremity? WILLOUGHBY: Not you. Not on your life, I don't. And, what's more, | don't go over that floor except just where they point out it's spotty exactly. And what do we usually say about that? You usually say, "Don'tcha have no brains, Conley? "Don'tcha know we meant you to clean the whole filthy floor?" And that always gives Conley a chance to say... "If I had any brains, what would I be doin' in this trap?" Come on, you're wanted in the warden's office. SHERRY: The warden's office? For what? It's just about time for the dinner to gong. Now, don't show off, Conley. Come on. (SIGHING) Like poor, dumb sheep, we're moved from barn to stall, and nobody takes the trouble to tell us why. WILLOUGHBY: It's inhuman. Don't volunteer for nothin'! This way. (LOW RUMBLING NOISE) When the inmates are thrown off schedule, you can't blame their stomachs for growlin' a little. WARDEN: Hello, Conley. As I understand it, Conley will remain in our custody even though you'll take her outside the prison? That's right, Warden. WARDEN: Get her into her street clothes, Willoughby. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, ma'am. Anything wrong? I'm sure if there was, I'd be the last one to be told. WARDEN: That will do, Conley. | don't suppose it'd do any good if I ask if my civil rights is bein' violated? | have a court order to make you available to the federal authorities. In an unfed condition? We won't be long, Lieutenant. (DEEP RUMBLING, GURGLING NOISE) This time, the inmate's stomach is not to be blamed. Four years of too many potatoes, Conley. Potatoes? | thought those were plastic cotton balls they were testin'. (ENGINE STARTING) (TYRES SCREECHING) Look out, will ya? Would you mind tellin' me what this is all... Nobody talks to me. Well, aren't we the real, life-size Boston Blackies?! Why? Why? (HORN HONKING) Help yourself. Thanks. Hey, look at them new styles! | guess maybe these old rags of mine must look like Easter parade, 1902. Look, sister, I wouldn't know styles if you shoved 'em down my throat. You're sure of that, huh? Why? Because you had so many of 'em shoved down your throat? Why is it nobody ever thought of buildin' a nice, big statue to the first cop who ever called a girl "sister"? Because, if he hadn't come along, the police'd sure put on their bare faces for small talk. What's it with a cop? Always gotta call ya "sister". You like "mother" better? Maybe I'd like my own name for a change. -Maybe you would. -Yeah, try it for size. Oh, look! Polka dots! Look at that dress in the window! | hope you don't object to a person looking out their own window? You'll know right away if I object to anything. What'll you do, light up? (CAR HORN HONKING) Would the world collapse if somebody was to tell me somethin'? Somebody will. Wait. -Whole floor cleared? -Yes, sir. -How about the roof? -The men are already up there. What are we gonna have, a party? What kind of prisoners do you keep here? Willoughby, get her settled. I'll be back in a minute. You didn't tell her anything? What about the trip down here? You sure you weren't followed? I'm sure I was. | lost 'em. -You're positive? -Please... All right. What's she like, Vince? Oh, just like the rest of 'em that come through the line-up. Smart-talkin', brassy, third-class citizen. And she's our last chance. If she doesn't come through, we'll be thrown outta court Monday, and there goes our two years' work. Then she oughta be in the city jail, where Costain can't knock her off. Let's do it my way. -What's so interesting? -People. And cars. But mostly people, who can go anyplace they wanna go. Haven't seen anybody like that for four years. -Who's that? -My daughter. -Are you married? -I was. He died in France, in the Normandy landings. Ah, none of us never knew that. It must scare you to death to have a daughter like this, with a job like yours, that always keeps pointin' out what can happen to a girl. And she's pretty. Pretty lucky kid, to have a mother like you that's so crazy about her. 'Course I am crazy about her, but... how did you know? You should've seen the look on your face when I said she was pretty. VINCE: Willoughby, send her in here. | guess they want you in there now. Ah, for what?! | don't know any more than you do, but you'd better go. (SIGHING) You don't, huh? Oh, we've finally arrived at the place where somebody's gonna explain this outrageous draggin' of a person from here to there? Yes, we've, er... finally arrived at that place, Miss Conley. Would you please sit down? My name is Lloyd Hallett. I'm an attorney for the government. You mean I'm up for some kind of tax rap? No, you're not up for any kind of rap, SO you can just relax. Would you care for a cigarette? SHERRY: Er... One for later, after dinner. Certainly. It's just that we thought that you could be helpful by giving us some information about a case that I'm prosecuting. Case”? What I know about cases, you could put on the head of a pin. -Perhaps I can be a little bit more explicit. -You do that. You, er, used to go around with a man by the name of Pete Tonelli, didn't you, Miss Conley? Go around? You mean, like merry-go-rounds and revolvin' doors? | mean, you used to be a friend of Tonelli's. Friends, perhaps, but nothin' more. Miss Conley, there's no danger of implicating yourself in anything by any answers that you might give me. I'd just like it made clear that, if Pete's done anything, he can do his own hangin'. -Well, that point is now on the record. -That's good. You, er... took a trip one time with Pete, didn't you? It was on a yacht. And I believe you went to the West Indies. Yacht? Yeah, you know, those long, white things. | know what's a yacht. Some cops has always gotta assume, just because you've been hauled in and persecuted falsely... "Persecuted falsely"? I'm sure the lieutenant didn't mean to offend you, Miss Conley. Excuse me, please. You better watch how you're kickin' my shins, mister. Vince, give me a hand. | thought, perhaps, you could use a drink. Yeah, like some dumb cops could use some manners. Er... that much over the flagstones, Mr Hallett. When are you gonna quit askin' her and start tellin' her for a change? Vince, would you like to step out of this room while I'm doing this? You gonna do it this way? Yeah. Thanks. There you are. -You're not joinin'? -No. | guess, where you've been, you can lap it up all you want. Well, here's to the boys in the friendly trenches. Skal! (COUGHING) Mmm. It's a wonderfully strong vintage. | don't know what you're after with me, Mr Hallett, but I will say I like the way you're goin' after it. But I think it's only fair to warn you that... I've been approached from every angle you can think of, including this one, of "let's get her loaded and see what happens". (CHUCKLING) | don't doubt it. Due to some kind of chemicals in my make-up, I guess, they always seem to run out of money before they ever find out what happens. Well, thank you for telling me. Now, to get back to this yachting trip that you took with Pete. Wasn't this boat owned by Mr Ben Costain? -Well, it musta been owned by somebody. -Yes, of course. It was a big enough boat, I can hardly imagine it being around unowned. Well, Costain owned it, and you were on it when it went to the West Indies. Since when is trips on yachts illegal? Miss Conley, I told you, we're not accusing you of anything. It's Ben Costain we're after. How many guys have already gone after... that person, and ended up twelve feet under? | think the government has a way to finally get him. If we can get some help from you. Me? Oh, he didn't even notice whether I had three heads or four that whole delightful cruise. (CHUCKLING) Now, on this, er... trip to the, er... West Indies, the boat put in to several islands, didn't it? -Did it? -You know it did. Why? Oh, I dunno. I merely took it that Mr Costain was interested in some untamed natives, perhaps. And, er... at one of these islands, this man came aboard the yacht. SHERRY: Signor Maracelli. The Italian garden expert. He taught me to say his name himself. Did you notice how long Signor Maracelli stayed aboard? Sure. Until we let him off one night, near Florida some place. For what reason? Oh, he was looking for some night-blooming wildlife. Did he come back to the yacht? They told us the signor was destroyed in a swamp. Well, these are the people that you don't doubt their word. When they tell ya somebody's been destroyed in a swamp, you don't ask for wet shoes as proof. Yes. Well, er... Signor Maracelli's real name happens to be Frank Domano. -One of the bosses of the Mafia. - I thought he'd get some place. And he's been involved in quite a few murders since he was destroyed in that swamp. And, by smuggling a man of this kind into the country, Costain perjured his application for citizenship. | mean that, when Costain swore that he was a man of good moral character, he lied. And the testimony of either you or Pete could prove that he lied. Well, er... unless Pete has changed an awful lot from the good ol' days, |, er... | don't get a very clear picture of him bustin' his back to call a man like Mr Costain a liar. How about you? Well, when I think of it in connection with myself, | just don't get no picture at all, clear or otherwise. Why not? Afraid? "Coward" would describe it better, Mr Hallett. Don't you think we could protect you? | wouldn't wanna put ya to the test, knowin' how embarrassed you'd be if you flunked. And why did you drag me up here when Pete could tell ya? Or has he already been approached, and did he spot the drawbacks as fast as I did? Pete's dead. I'm assumin' it wasn't old age. He was murdered by the Costain mob. Well, I wouldn't wanna say "I told you so," but that's a point I'd like to make. It was a ruthless, vicious, unnecessary killing. Just like all the others Costain has been responsible for the last twenty-five years. Well, he's been at it long enough to get good, all right. You don't seem to understand, Miss Conley. We're trying to deport Costain. And it should be everyone's responsibility to see that we're successful. -That's the way you feel. -Yes, I do. And if anyone has the least bit of help to give us, it's his obligation to society to give it. Yeah, well, if anybody's gotten anything but a kick in the face from society, | don't doubt he might owe somethin' back to it. You realise that you're the only one who can help us, don't you? I'm afraid I've been wastin' your time, Mr Hallett. Wasting? The more I think about it, the more I realise it was the North Indies we went to on our trip. It was the West Indies. SHERRY: "Good evening. Have you called for one of our tastefully gay dinners?" No, I haven't! Hello? I'd like to speak to somebody about your Lobster Thermidors. For eating, yes. -You can order anything you like, Miss Conley. -Well, that's nice to hear. Only after we've finished our talk about Costain. You mean the subject's not exhausted?! | wish you wouldn't make up your mind definitely until you've carefully thought it over. My mind was making up while I was hearing that Pete was no longer with us. HALLETT: I'm not denying that it is dangerous. But I can assure you that nothing is going to be left undone to give you every possible protection. Yeah, but how can | even think about it when I'm famished all over the place? Perhaps you're not acquainted with just exactly what my rights as a prisoner are under several, already-legislated laws? Section 3, article 12: "Feeding of Prisoners. "Prisoners will be fed at three regulated intervals during the daylight hours, "at six in the mornings, at twelve o'clock noons, "and at five p.m." Today, these intervals have been anything but regulated. Would you like to check my authenticity in the book of regulations, Mr Hallett? Miss Conley, I bow to your authenticity. After this, we'll try and stick to the rules. -Yeah, you do that. -(CHUCKLING) It's me again, about those Lobster Thermidors. -Would you like me to order for you? -No, I'd like the fun of doin' it myself. All right. But, before I leave, I'd like to assure you that no-one is going to make you do anything against your will. I'm afraid there isn't much of a fat chance of that happenin', Mr Hallet. I'll be back later. Good. No, I don't wanna talk to the manager. | wanna talk to the man that cooks those tastefully gay dinners. You may as well stuff yourself, too, Willoughby. Tonight, it's on the taxpayers. How'd it go? | didn't expect much on the first try. She didn't jump at the chance, huh? Well, what's the plan now? I'm gonna talk to the governor about making a deal on her sentence and get a couple of other things going. How long do you think we can keep it from Costain that we've got her here? That's hard to say. He's got connections in prison, like anywhere else. He knows we picked her up, he knows we haven't arrived at the city jail with her, so he'll figure we've got her stashed. Well, in the meantime, please be nice to her. It won't hurt our cause a bit if you treat her like a lady. You think she'll know what we're doin'? There wouldn't be a lady left if, every time one of them acted ladylike, she got kicked in the face. Now, take good care of her. She's no good to us if she won't testify. Yeah, if she's too dead. HALLETT: Down, please. -Where's Conley? -She wanted to take a shower. -A shower? - I didn't see any harm in it! -(HARD SLAP) -SHERRY: Ow! So this is what the police has sunk to. Willoughby, the next time she wants to take a shower, you sit on her lap. | mean it. You ever lay a fat hand on my person again, and the prison board will hear about it before I'm even dry! MAN ON PHONE: | won't lose him again. -(RECEIVER SLAMMING) -Dumb slob. Losin' that DA so I don't even know where he's been for the last two hours. We'll find out where they've taken her. There's no need to get so upset. (CASTAIN CHUCKLING) "We'll find out," eh? For two-hundred-grand-a-year attorney's fees, you couldn't even find out they were gonna spring that Tonelli on us. | don't have all your sources of information, Ben. Yeah. (DIALLING PHONE NUMBER) -Well? -MAN: Nothing yet. The money I spend to make sure I got people in all the places where it counts, they can't even find out where they're hidin' one lousy dame. They leave the prison to take her to city jail three hours ago. They haven't got there yet. (CRUMPLING PAPER) Tonelli, they thought they had hidden out at Staten Island. Where do they think this one's gonna be safe? | wouldn't worry too much about her, in any case, Ben. Wouldn't you? Maybe that's because they're not tr yin' to run you outta your own country, and send you to some lousy place you don't even remember. She isn't going to hurt us, Ben. No, she isn't. Just let me find out where they're keepin' her... (PHONE RINGING) MAN: She's in room 24009, St Charles Hotel. The girl's in room 2409 at the St Charles Hotel. Room 2409, St Charles Hotel. (SWITCHING TV ON) Have you ever stopped to consider what you'd look like completely bald? What? TV: My sponsor's product means exactly what it says. Mor... (SWITCHING CHANNEL) Yessir, folks, this is your old hillbilly cousin, Mississippi Mac. Now, say, if up until now you haven't had any hillbilly cousins in your home, ! want you to open up your hearts, and I'm a-gonna creep right in. Oh, brother. Well, sir, we've only been on the air six hours and 47 minutes, but we're gonna be on the air until Monday, and longer than that if it takes it to raise that $50,000. -(SWITCHING TV OFF) -Leave it on! -(SIGHING) (SWITCHING TV ON) MAC: Now, if you folks out there have been ea yin' to yourself, "What am I gonna do with that ol' $100 bill "that's been la yin' around the house and collectin' dust and curious glances?" Well, sir, you just send it in to old Mississippi Mac, and he'll see that some boy gets a chance to lead a normal, bronco-bustin', rope-twirlin' life. Yessir. And, while you're sendin' in your donations, I'm gonna sing for you. 3 I'm a-pinin' for my gal in Cactus Valley 3 Well, there never was a gal like Sal from Cactus Valley 3 She can cuss and holler and rope and yell 3 She loves like a banshee straight from 'ell... J ...Paso!? Um... he is pretty awful. Perhaps we better just turn him off for now, 'cause he's gonna be on all night, anyway. (SWITCHING TV OFF) Never mind, Peeping John. | made sure there was nothin' left over for you to enjoy. -Aw... -Bad as it is in prison, havin' to share the privacy of your shower with all the other inmates, at least we don't have to put up with being slapped by the fat hands of the police. You've hauled men in for less. Willoughby, you got a needle and thread? What do you want it for? Well, this rag is nearly strangling all my circulation off. Maybe there's a seam we can open up, or somethin', so I won't be so scrunched and pinched in places. -Or I could go down to the drugstore. -VINCE: You can call. -I'd like a little coffee, too. -They'll send that up, too. Afraid I won't come back, Lieutenant? All right, go ahead. Besides, when a person's places are all scrunched and pinched, why, something's liable to bust right out. And that'd drive all the Peepin' Johns in the place stark, starin' crazy. Right?! -Will you shut up about my... -I won't be long, Lieutenant. -Oh, my pocketbook. -Charge it to the room. (LOCKING DOOR) Is that the way a genuine model does it? Again, please? You used to be a model, didn't ya? How could you tell? It's on your police record. Oh. You models must lead a gay life for yourselves, huh? Never have to worry about who's gonna pick up the dinner tab... Haha. It's not a gay life? What's gay about blistered feet and a bunch of sleazy married guys with ideas that were stale when the Romans was eatin' lions? Well, how long were you at it? Modellin'? Since I was sixteen. Sixteen? Well, what should I have done, sold pencils maybe? Or gone on relief, for which there isn't any for 16-year-old girls? -Well, what did you do, lie about your age? -Who to? They're more interested that you're a real build kid, not how old a real build kid. VINCE: Yeah. Who got you the job? | was waitin' for a bus one windy day, when all the skirts was blowin', and this fella drives up in a top-down convertible and struck up an introduction. He was a real cornball, and he... he sorta looked me over, and he said, "Well, now, are there any more at home like you, little lady?" So, I told him the only thing there was any more of at my home was a brother, six foot four, who liked to knock out teeth for exercise. Well, I... I just made this brother up out of my head for protection. Huh. So, um... well, then what happened? And... well, he went on and said, er... "A little girl like you shouldn't be waitin' all alone "for buses in this big, cold world. “I'm gonna introduce you to a friend of mine that makes bathin' suits." So, I told him I didn't know anything about how to make bathin' suits, and he said, er... "No, little lady, you wouldn't make "em. "You'd wear 'em." And then he went on to explain that he didn't mean at beaches, but at buyers' shows, where these out-of-town fellas like himself would come to pick up whatever looked good to 'em. And, er.. whatever looks good to these fellas is that old combination of, er... "most girl, least bathing suit", if you know what I mean. Yeah, I think I do. Sol... got the bathing-suit job. And then... for a year there, we were sort of makin' plans for gettin' married, until... one gloomy day, this older woman pops up from Omaha, and she starts or yin' and wringin' her hands out and pleadin' with me that I should leave him alone, for his own good. | should leave him alone, for his own good. (CHUCKLING) Men. They oughta trade themselves in for somethin' a girl really needs. VINCE: Oh... Well, you've got it all figured out about men, haven't ya? You're all alike. You only got different faces so we girls can tell ya apart. -Take yourself, for instance. -What about me? | walk out here with no skirt, and your eyes bang out like you just found some long-lost gold mine. Oh, sure. Everybody's after you, every minute. Yeah, it might seem so, if you were sittin' in my shoes. -Yeah, well, you can relax, honey. -Well, thanks. I intend to. 'Cause I could come back from ten years alone on the moon, half-crazy, and watch you swimming, stripped, at the Y for hours, and walk outta there with no thoughts in my head except where I could get myself a good meal. Now, that was a crummy thing to say. Ah, it wasn't as bad as all that. Well, since I was the one that was insulted, you might let me be the judge of how bad it was. Okay, I'm sorry. If you didn't know where I was from, you wouldn't talk to me like that. Now, look, I said I was sorry. And I mean it. I'm sorry. Well... Doesn't matter much anyway, since... none of us girls never swim stripped at the Y, even when people are watchin'. And how could you possibly know that all you'd be thinkin' about was a good meal? You might not be as interested in food as you think you'd be. (FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE) -(RAPID KNOCKING ON DOOR) -MAN: Vince? Vince? -Trouble on the roof. -Lee, get in there and stay with her! Hurry up, Willoughby! -What did I do? -We found him hiding in the elevator. Well, I work there. That's my job. Well, maybe he's tellin' the truth, maybe he isn't. He was actin' funny. See how you'd act if about twenty guys jump on you all of a sudden. Take him down and check with the manager. If you make a mistake, apologise. Oh, pretty! Packer, check these elevator shafts. Seal them off at the roof. -You mean, climb up and down inside her? -You heard me. -You heard him. -Yes, sir. -Glad you're a lieutenant these days? -Any day. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -VINCE: Lee? What was the matter? Oh, just an elevator man. He kinda got off course. Oh. | was just thinkin'... why should I have them steamed clams for dinner? So far, you've changed from Lobster Thermidor to pheasant to steamed clams. -Now you wanna change again?? -So? Any reason, except maybe you're tr yin' to bankrupt the government? Since when does a woman need a reason for changin' her mind? Anyway, Mr Hallett said I could have anything that struck me. Yeah, but he didn't know what he was ea yin'. Besides, with all this changing, how do you ever expect to get fed? Well, it's just that I want it right when I do eat. They're gonna love you in the kitchen. Anyway, I'm cancelling the clams. Pfft, out! Fine. When I think how it was with you cops the last time I was framed. | was hauled in all over the place, when I even asked for a glass of water or some legal advice, what did you say? "Drop 10,000 feet dead." Look, I never saw you before tonight. Unfortunately, a cop is a cop. You were sent up on a charge of accessory to a crime and harbouring a criminal. And, bein' a cop, you couldn't imagine it might be a phoney rap, could ya? | never met one of you girls yet who wasn't up on a phoney rap. And why should a cop strain his brain to give anybody the benefit of his cheesy doubt? All right. What was this crime? Er... the one you weren't an accessory to? Well, this payroll, where I was working as a model, was stuck up. All by itself? Or did your boyfriend help? So what? How was I to know he was gonna do a stupid thing like that? -Didn't he ever do anything stupid before? -So, all right, he might've, but... What was he supposed to have, his record tattooed on his forehead or somethin'? -Why didn't you ask him for his credentials? -Oh, now he tells me! Now, let's see if I can give you the rest of the facts, ma'am. This guy romances you and finds out all about the payroll setup. Then, when he finally pulls the job, he bungles it and a guard gets shot and the boyfriend himself probably takes a bullet in some not-too-vital spot. How does he do it with nothin' to go on? Except the police files that tell the whole story. | didn't need any police files. That story was old and stale when they were stickin' up pyramids. So, after he gets shot, he comes runnin' to you and you hide him out in your apartment, the last place in the world the cops would ever think of lookin' for him. How does he figure it out with nothing to go on? Except a charge that reads "harbouring a criminal”. Well, you did hide him out, didn't ya? So what's so "phoney" about the rap? How was I to know he was gonna stick up the joint in the first place? -Then you were a chump to hide him. -A chump, I was. But that isn't what I was charged with. You don't believe me, do ya? Well, a jury didn't, that's obvious. What jury? This $75 lawyer I hired told me to plead guilty and throw myself on the mercy of this judge. The only mercy was he didn't hang me on the spot. After serving four years of this guy's mercy, next time, I'm gonna put some poison in the hollow of my tooth. Anyway, the whole point of this whole thing is, I've definitely decided I don't want any steamed clams. Okay. What have you decided you wanted now? Well, I was sorta thinking maybe I'd have something under glass, like... cracked crab or... crépes of chicken. Well, there's such a thing. You want to order some of it for me? Please? I'd be two days gettin' up the nerve. You better do it yourself. If somebody should locate him, have him call me. My office here will know where to reach me all night. Yeah. Thanks. All I've been able to dig up is that she's got a father and a married sister somewhere in the city. Those are probably old addresses, but we'll get on 'em in the morning. Tonight. -Tonight? -Tonight. Do you realise that that trial reopens in exactly 37 hours? And, without Conley as a witness, we'll probably be sent back to law school for the refresher course. Okay. Any news from the governor? No, he's off some place opening an apple festival or something. He'll get back to me tonight sometime. If he agrees to commute the rest of her sentence, do you think she'll testify? All we can do is try it on her for size. (INTERCOM BUZZING) -Yes? -SECRETARY: Mr Rickles to see you. -Who? -Rickles, Marvin Rickles. He says he's the attorney for Mr Costain. -Send him in. -I'll go. He probably doesn't like witnesses when he's bribing government officials. Don't you want to hear what he has to say? | get sick so easily. | apologise for disturbing you at this late hour, Mr Hallett. Well, what difference does time make as long as you have something to say? -Sit down. -I'll only keep you a moment. We've been hearing some rumours about another secret witness that have disturbed us greatly, Mr Hallett. Well, since I don't know what you've heard. That you have a secret witness you're going to spring in court Monday morning. My experience a few days ago should have taught me that I can't surprise you people. | don't know what you mean. | mean that you were ready and waiting for Tonelli. Are you accusing Mr Costain of having anything to do with Tonelli's death? Oh, knock it off, Rickles. This office isn't wired for anything, so don't play persecuted client with me. Tonelli was a cheap hoodlum with hundreds of enemies. Any one of them could have killed him. Yes, and the stork could have brought him in the first place. Only I don't believe that stuff anymore, because I know that on a police force, even as good as ours, you can always dig up one or two who'll sell out. And you did dig them up, didn't you? And they did tip you off about Tonelli. You may have to back up those charges, Hallett. Oh, that's all. In a hearing of this kind, the defence has a right to question all witnesses beforehand. -You know that, Hallett. - I didn't say I had a witness, you did. And don't think I'm going to sit still for any of your unethical trial practices, Hallett. I've been conditioned to stomach almost anything. But not to hearing somebody like you talking about ethics. -Look here... -Ethics! Don't you choke when you say a word like that, Rickles? -We have certain legal rights in this case... -You don't have any rights to anything! Except maybe to be stamped out like any other disease. We'll see what rights we have when | get you in court Monday morning. While you're seeing about it, get out of here. Hallett, I'm warning you, if it's the last thing I ever do... It's gonna be the last thing you ever did if you don't get out of here! -(DOOR SLAMMING) (DOOR REOPENING) Can I bust in for a minute? Thirty seconds. | thought newspaper reporters were supposed to be drunk by this time on Saturday night. Just the ones with money. What was Rickles doin' here? -Tr yin' to buy you off? -He thinks I'm unethical. You know something? I am. Whenever I deal with something dirty, | always get a little soiled myself. | think the whole thing's a joke anyway. Costain's a public menace who's been murdering and looting the country for 25 years. What's he finally brought to trial on? Denaturalisation charges. -Well, it's a start. -Yeah. Now, look, Jim. If I can get just one witness to get on that stand to testify against him, then, all of a sudden, all the others who know anything against Costain will suddenly get courage. Then we'll start hitting him with something that counts. But, first, I need that one witness. Have you got one? Your thirty seconds are up. You might as well not show up in court, Lloyd, if you don't have something spectacular. Well? Will you be in court Monday? I'll be the one with the briefcase. (INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF "LITTLE BROWN JUG" ON TV) (MARIMBA SOUNDS) (SWITCHING TV OFF) You can only hope he taps a hole through his head. Hey, Willoughby, aren't ya afraid that stuff's gonna spoil you for real police work? The real thing is for six-year-olds. And the girls in these things, don't they ever get cold? -Not those girls. -Wanna borrow it tonight? Nah, anything sexier than Popular Mechanics, | break out in a rash, all over. You enjoy your dinner? | finished it all up. You didn't think I would, did ya? | didn't think you could. | didn't think anybody could. -Whaddaya say we drink a toast? -Nah. Oh, come on, Lieutenant. You've no idea how long it's been since I had a toast with any kinda man. Much less somethin' like you. No kiddin'. You've no idea how utterly desirable you are to a girl. (GIGGLING) What's the toast? Here's to the men that blow up prisons. Don't worry, I won't snitch on you that you drank on duty. Just make sure you don't tell what he drank to. (PHONE RINGING) I'll take it inside. You know, he's sorta nice. Is he married? -I never saw him before. -Oh. What's there about him that you like? | dunno. That he's here, I guess. Have you decided what you're going to do? -About the lieutenant? -(CHUCKLING) No. | mean about Mr Hallett. Oh. Why? Has he tried to get you to work on me, too? You know better than that. I'm sorry. Mr Hallett tells me that I owe it to society to testify at the trial, as my last livin' act. What do you think I owe to society, Willoughby? | wouldn't wanna say. Well, if I was your daughter, what would you tell me to do? | never tell her what to do. But I have tried to teach her to face her obligations. Well, who says this is my obligation? And who wants a hero with her insides blasted out with a shotgun? And how are you gonna be sure that your daughter doesn't end up like me? There isn't any way I can be sure. But I can make her feel wanted. And see to it that she gets all the love I have to give. Those are the things all of you girls seem to need the most. That's a fact. All the love I ever got, you could put in your right eye. Yeah, you're right. A little love never hurt anybody. Yeah. Anything else? Yeah, tell her about the governor's offer. Give her a chance to think it over before I get there. I'm leaving right now. Hey, Willoughby, why don't you try to get yourself some rest? The hours are gonna get about 80 minutes long at four o'clock in the morning. Hmm, you're right. Wake me up if you turn that thing on, and Mississippi Mac suddenly gets funny. VINCE: Ha! | just talked to Hallett. -He's such a refined man. -Yeah. Anyway, he says he's gonna be able to knock off the rest of your sentence if ya string along with him Monday morning. -The whole eleven months? -Yup. Have you any idea how long eleven months is in a place like that? Long. Very, very long. Then that's quite an offer, hmm? Maybe. How come you haven't asked me for a date tonight? Oh, maybe I figured it was Saturday night, you're all tied up... Or maybe you just don't like girls. No, I never found anything | liked better. You know, for a couple of reasons, one of them being how much it costs to feed ya. I... | just can't figure you for Pete Tonelli's girl. | told ya, I wasn't. Yeah, but the boat trips all over the western hemisphere, how about that? Eastern! Western! My actions were as pure as the driving snow. And, what's more, Pete was the brother of Mitzi Tonelli, who was one of my closest friends during a certain period of my life. You mean that's why you went yachting with Pete, because Mitzi asked you to? No, because he asked me to. That's what I mean. Why? Did he have any money then, or what? He didn't have nothin' then. He was just a poor, ugly, miserable, little beat-up guy. Oh, but you just happened to see something in him... SHERRY: What was there to see? He had nothin' nobody could possibly want. Nothin'. That's why, when Costain invited him on the yacht to bring his girlfriend, he was in a real spot. -Who'd go with him? -You. Sure. I felt sorry for him. Huh! He wanted to look good in front of... this person, so he thought if he took along a kind of... -...pretty girl. -Yeah, a pretty girl? Well, anyway, he thought I was pretty. And he figured if he had a girl of... this particular type along to hold hands with him while this other person was watchin'... -Well, that makes sense. -It didn't, neither. They never looked our way once during the whole voyage. Yeah, but you were always ready, weren't you, to...? To hold hands, nothin' more. Only hands. | get the picture. | guess you think it was... kinda cheap of me, huh? No, |, er... That sounds to me like the kind of a favour that only a real nice girl would think of doing. You really think that? Yup. Well, it was nothin', really. Well, anyway, Mitzi Tonelli was your best friend at this particular period. She could strangle and never get a tear from me nowadays. 3 My true love is dead and buried ♪ In a spot that I call home 3 Since the epidemic took her ♪ I no longer cared to roam 3 When the angels come and got her 4 I remember what she said 3 "Give my shoes to cousin Helen 3 "She can wear them while I'm dead" & Thank you very much there, boys.

(SOBBING) Let's get her in the bedroom. Now, hold it a minute. Nobody's going in there. Oh. What's happened? Oh, there's been a shooting somewhere in the top storey, sir. -Who is it? -No identification yet. It wasn't the fall from the top storey that killed him. He was shot before he started down. All he needs now is a well-dug grave. (SIRENS OUTSIDE) (SHERRY CRYING IN BEDROOM) (SHERRY SOBBING) Ow! -You're hurting me! -HALLETT: How is she? VINCE: She's got a crease through the arm. -SHERRY: Hey, I wanna talk to you! -DOCTOR: You'd better lie down. SHERRY: Enough of this lying down. | wanna go back to my nice, safe prison. You're gonna have to lie down and let the shot work. There are too many shots already workin' around here! You're better off here than you would be anyplace else. Yeah, if you're not dyin' at death's door, you're doin' fine. We're all doing the best we can. -Somebody isn't! -Well, I'll give orders that... -What's the matter with Willoughby? -Doc! Get an ambulance over here! She should've been taken care of first! VINCE: She didn't tell us anything. | guess she was waitin' till you got through with her. Oh, no! It wasn't too much of a trick to get up there from that, Lieutenant. Fine, thanks. WOMAN: It was an awful thing to have happen... on your honeymoon! | thought it was the waiter with the champagne I'd ordered. When I answered the door, they just pushed right past me and one of 'em covered me with a gun. -How many of them? -There were three. And they were just terrible to me. I'd have torn 'em to pieces if it hadn't been for that gun. Yeah, it was lucky for them they thought to bring it along. They were wearing some sort of overalls and carrying those short planks. Everything's under control, Vince. Come on back upstairs when you get through. Is that blood on your shirt? | took two bullets through the chest, ma'am. Just routine. It was actually three bullets, ma'am. We haven't told him yet. OFFICER: All right, let's hurry up with this. There were four of 'em, not three. The fourth one held a gun on the elevator operator to keep the elevator ready. When the deal went sour, they ran outta the room, into the elevator, dropped down to the basement and out in the alley, where they had a car waiting. | just clocked it. They were probably outta the building in forty seconds. Oh, nice to know how they do these things. You still want to move her to the city jail? Oh, you mean, now? Now that Costain knows we got her, and Willoughby's all shot to pieces? Now and not before, when she shoulda been there, is that it? I've got my side of the job on this thing, and that's to see that she agrees to get on that stand. -Dead or alive? -Alive, and that's your job. -Well, that's what I'm trying to do! -Now, I asked you, do you still want to take her to the city jail? Look, Costain has probably got this hotel covered right now, just waitin' for us to pull somethin' stupid like that. Well, then I guess we better not. All this hasn't accomplished very much, has it? You couldn't get her on that stand now with a gun in her back. Then why don't we just quit? Wave a white flag out the window, and maybe Costain will be nice enough and not make us leave the country. (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) (BELLS TOLLING) (OTHER BELLS JOINING IN) (BELLS FAINTLY AUDIBLE) VINCE (QUIETLY) Hi. (SIGHING) Mm-hmm. How you feel? Terrible. | feel groggy all over. Somethin' funny's been goin' on around here. | couldn't get that dopey from the dinner I ate last night. -Here. -Uh-uh. I'm not gonna drink anything or eat anything until I know what's in it. You couldn't live two hours without eating. -Here. -Uh-uh. Oh... Watch. If we're gonna go, we'll go together. See? Come on. Drink it up. It'll make you feel better. Oh, yeah? When's that gonna be? -How's the arm? -Mmm! Feels like somebody's been gnawin' on it with dull teeth. -You want the doctor? -Only the one at the prison. A girl's never been appreciative enough of how free from Killers those crummy places are. How's Willoughby? Just the same, no change. Hey! | got a surprise for you. There. Well, go on, open it. What's in it? It's sittin' right in your lap. Why don't you find out? White with polka dots! Hey! Hey, you better look at it sittin' down, huh? No, I'm all right now. Oh-ho-ho! Good as the Easter parade, 19027 Better. Hey, wait a minute. Could there be some sentiments behind this gift that aren't kosher enough to write on a card? -What? -Government officials bribin' people? | thought it was usually the other way around. What are you talkin' about? Mr Hallett thinks that polka dots are suitable to make me forget that visitor at the window last night? Oh, no wonder taxes keep goin' up. Nobody uses their brains anymore, only their expense accounts. Somebody is gonna get investigated. Well, did I stumble onto the motive? If you say so, sister, all right. Oh, so it's "sister" again, is it? Yeah. Well, I don't care how disgustingly ulterior the motive is, I'm not gonna let it upset my enjoyment. So, purely out of curiosity about the fit, I'm gonna try it on. So you can tell Mr Hallett quite clearly that my acceptance of this gift doesn't mean that I intend to get caught dead on his witness stand. Hey, the intervals are getting irregulated again. Somebody better spring for my breakfast. (DOOR CLOSING) -Well? -For the fifth time, it looks great. | thought so, too, but I just wanted another opinion. Hey, your breakfast's out there. You mean you're not gonna eat? Imagine me havin' to be told such a thing. But I'm so excited, | couldn't eat a drop. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) -Good morning. -Good morning. Good morning. Well, look at you. Yeah, I got it on me. Turn around, let's see you. That looks like about $200 worth of dress. And a million dollars' worth of model. Where'd you get it? -What? -Where'd it come from? Well, I thought you and the government... Like those grafters with their expense accounts. (CHUCKLING) Well, you and that dress were certainly made for each other. -It's the nicest dress I ever owned. -Mmm. -More polka dots, for one thing. -Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. | really mean it, I'm sorry. -Where'd you get it? -Get it? Oh, it wasn't any trouble, really. | called up a guy I know in Jersey, got him out of bed at four o'clock in the morning, he drove in, opened up his shop, took him a coupla hours. Wasn't any trouble, really. -Vince... -You like it? Like it? He gave it to me. Oh? Well, that's nice. (CHURCH BELLS FAINTLY TOLLING) | wish I could wear it to church this morning. You religious, Sherry? Doesn't look very much like it, does it? No, they used to try to get me to go to church in prison, but what kinda place is that to go to church? -Can I have a cigarette? -Mmm. Yeah, there was a time when I was a kid that... | used to go to church every Sunday. Mr Hallett, I hope you understood that I meant what I said last night about goin' back to prison. Miss Conley, believe me... SHERRY: No, sir, I'm not fooled by this lull in the Killin'. Yes, but if Costain... Mr Costain and I are both interested in one law. The law of self-preservation. You've heard of it. It's on the books. Yes, |I... I've heard of it. | know what I'm asking you to do is dangerous. Take it from the target, it's very dangerous. Yes, I know, but, until we can get rid of Costain once and for all, somebody's life is always gonna be at stake. Yeah, and since that life happens to be mine, | hope you'll excuse me if I turn and start runnin'. HALLETT: Well, until somebody finally has the courage... If somebody doesn't start getting me on my way back to my cell, I'm gonna start screamin' for some lawyers. HALLETT: No! Wait another hour, just an hour. It'll take that long to arrange the move anyway. -Please. -(TUTTING) All right. One hour. But, after that, I'm gonna stick my head out that window and start screamin' for some advice of counsel. (DOOR CLOSING) What happens in an hour? We've located her older sister. One of my men is on his way in with her now. -And what can she do? -That's what I'm trying to find out. You know, I can't keep her much longer if she keeps screaming to go back. Why not? She's a prisoner, isn't she? Well, prisoners have some rights, Vince. She wasn't sentenced to battle the whole Costain mob. A good lawyer could beat my brains out for keeping her here against her will. Look, do you mind if I duck home and get myself a clean shirt? -Who's on duty? -Fred Packer. He's all right. He can take care of anything. All right, but, er... don't stay away too long. MAN: Get In. (HEAVY BLOW) Your sister doesn't know that you're coming. Yeah. Yeah, that's what she said. Packer. -Make yourself at home. -You want me to clear out? Thanks, Fred. -Shall I get her, Mr Hallett? -Yes. Won't you sit down, please? Would you care for a...? Well, I had no idea criminals were treated like this. Well, it isn't always like that. Maybe Sherry's been right and I was wrong. Maybe it doesn't pay to be an honest, hard-working woman who never gets into any kind of trouble. SHERRY: She doesn't really mean that, Mr Hallett. She'd never believe she was wrong about anything in her whole life. Hard-workin' Clara, give you the shirt off her back if you pay her twice what it was worth. How are you, Sherry? Do you really care? Or is that all you could think of to say? -It's been a long time, Sherry. -Yeah, hasn't it? How long has it been, Clara? -Six years? Eight? Eleven? -I was laid up for quite a while, Sherry. What'd you do, bust all your fingers, so you couldn't write a letter or a postcard? Or maybe you didn't know | was in prison. -Yeah, Roy heard about it somewhere. -Oh, and how is good ol' Roy? -Still kickin' kids for exercise? - I better leave you two alone. No, you better stick around, Mr Hallett, 'cause I want you to see what a dumb move this was on your part. What was the plan? That my lovin' sister was gonna talk me into goin' into that court? There really wasn't any plan, Miss Conley. | merely thought that, er... Well, you goofed, Mr Hallett. You'd've had to dug real deep to find anybody that had less of a chance with me. And, even if she coulda talked me into anything, do you think she would've, unless there was something in it for her? That's not true, Sherry. Why isn't it? You mean you've changed, Clara? You mean that, these days, you'd bust both of your arms to help somebody who was in trouble? And, if somebody needed a place to stay, that, nowadays, you'd throw open all your doors and dump another bean in the pot? It isn't my fault! Roy didn't want you to stay! - I didn't ask Roy, I asked you! -He's my husband, isn't he?! -It was his house! - I sure knew it wasn't mine, -the way I was shoved out! -I begged him! That's the kinda sister to have, Mr Hallett. Early in life, she lets you know that there's not a soul in the world that cares whether you live or die. And what was I supposed to do? If I'd insisted Roy let you stay, he'd have thrown me out right along with you! Oh, and you wouldn't wanna take a chance of losing such a wonderful guy as that, would you? You bet I wouldn't! Things hadn't been any easier for me than they were for you. And if you think I wanted to take a chance of losing the only home I'd ever had, you were crazy! | was crazy, all right! Because somewhere I'd heard that sisters are supposed to mean somethin' to each other. But you sure knocked that idea out of my head before it had a chance to feel at home there. CLARA: We all had to look out for ourselves. Maybe it never occurred to you that if I'd had anything that even looked like a home when I was sixteen years old, that maybe I wouldn't have ended up in prison. Yeah. Maybe I coulda amounted to somethin' if I'd had even a little help then. -Put yourself in my place. -With that guy?! -He's been good to me! -Oh, what's he ever done for you, except let you carry out the garbage on the night when it rains? He gave me a home and some security. And you oughta know what that meant after all those years of livin' in a house with Mom and Pop fighting all the time. | just ran outta sympathy. Oh, what difference does it make? (LAUGHING) It's a real laugh that you thought she could talk me into anything. Oh, I didn't come up here to talk you into testifying. | came up here to beg you not to. Why? What do you care what I do? | don't. | mean, I know I don't have any right to interfere, -but Roy wanted me... -Are you tr yin' to tell me that ol' nasty-heart cares whether | stick my neck out or not? It isn't that. You see, we own a small barroom of our own now. And Roy thinks if you do this thing against Costain, he'll take it out on anybody who's connected with you in any way. Did you hear that? | shouldn't testify against Costain because it might be bad for Roy's business! -Oh, no! -Yeah. Well, it might be. You don't know how it is in the bar business, with all those licences they can take away from you at any time. And you know yourself, all Mr Costain would have to do is pick up a phone and ruin anybody he wants to. -And you've got the nerve to ask me. -It doesn't make any difference to you, one way or the other, and it does to us. If I thought that I could take a kick at that miserable husband of yours by getting up on that stand, I'd... -Get outta here! -Sherry, please! Of all the lousy... Get out of here! Oh, er... Mrs Moran, er... You mean you brought me up here to let me be insulted by some cheap dame, even if she is my sister? If you don't get outta here in no seconds flat, you're gonna find I got a sister with no hair and no teeth at all! Roy was right! You're no good, like Pop. And you're not worth helping! (SOBBING) I'm sorry, Miss Conley. Oh, why do we always have to act like this? Like wild dogs, instead of blood sisters? -But it wasn't altogether your fault. -Nah! | went after her the minute | came into this room, and it's... It's always been like that. Every time I even see her, | don't know... A thousand little hurts well up in me. | could see that. Did you see her? Like a scared rabbit, afraid of everything. Do you think she's ever shown any sisterly responsibility to me? Nah. Because it might be a threat to her lousy little security. -Yeah, I know. -And what has it got her? Solitary confinement with that low character she's married to. What a life. I'll bet, if she admitted it, she's miserable. Well, that's the very thing I've been trying to point out to you, about facing responsibilities. Yeah. Oh. Oh, I get your point, but... You gotta be sure that they are your responsibilities. And, provided... what you gotta do doesn't take... all the nerve in the world, which you haven't got. You've got plenty, Sherry. It takes courage. And you gotta be born with it. Or maybe I was born with it and got it kicked outta me by certain close members of my immediate, crummy family. COSTAIN: Hold it, Arny. He's mad at you for killin' his brother last night. Playin' everything your own way these days, huh? Why'd you shake the tail | put on ya yesterday? Made it that much harder for me to find out where you'd taken her. Because I had a smart matron in the car. And that guy you had tail me was wearin' a neon sign to advertise he was following me. And, on top of this, | guess you figured you didn't have enough front-page publicity lately. Or did you just wanna show everybody how good you can pop a gun? Look, it was your boy that was tr yin' to get himself a medal. -He didn't care who he shot. -COSTAIN: He was after the girl. Then he read his instructions wrong. Or did he figure you wanted two for the price of one? Next time, let's make it clear to him who his friends are, huh? Lots of things'll be different next time. Who's the other woman they brought in? Her sister. What do they want with her? Hallett figures maybe she can talk the girl into testifyin'. -Can she? -VINCE: I don't know. | left before they got there. You want my opinion? Nobody's gonna talk her into nothin'. You got nothin' to worry about. Can you imagine how that relieves my mind to hear him say that I shouldn't worry? That's what I pay him for, to reassure me. If anything goes wrong, he can always say it was just an opinion. Both ends against the middle, that's the way Vince likes to play things. -You asked me. - I asked you to help us get rid of the girl -so she couldn't bother us again. -VINCE: I told you, let's wait and... -"He told me!" -...see if she is gonna bother us. COSTAIN: I guess you forgot to tell me that he's running things now. - I didn't mean it like that. -Didn't you? It'd suit you just fine, wouldn't it, to see me booted out of the country? Wouldn't that be a sweet cover-up for a cop who's been on the take for the past ten years? To have his whole, smelly past put on a boat and sent some place where it couldn't ever bother him again. You're not makin' any sense. Whaddaya want everybody's neck stickin' out for? She's not gonna talk, anyway. Because I like everybody's neck stuck out when mine is. You know what's gonna happen to you if she gets on that stand, don't you? Look, she hasn't even come close to ea yin' she'll testify. And you haven't even come close to saying what you'll do if she does. Mr Costain wants to know if he can depend on you, Vincent. Do what? Shove her out the window? If that's what it has to be. Oh, sure, with Hallett and twenty cops watchin' every minute. And why should |, when it isn't even necessary? Because, as long as she's still at the hotel, we can give you some help. After she's moved to the city jail tonight, you'll have to do it all by yourself. Nobody's movin' her to any city jail. ARNY: At eight o'clock tonight, they are. How do you know? You know I make it a point to know everything about everything that concerns me, Vince. ARNY: So if you want any help, you'll have to get it before they move her. There isn't any way it can be done. We'll show you. | don't want you to miss a word. Next time we meet, it could be a big celebration, lots of money being passed around. Or it could be the last look I'll be taking at your face before they start shovelling dirt on it. You made your point. COSTAIN: Good. You do exactly like we tell you, you'll be completely in the clear. You don't have to do anything more than you've been doing for the past ten years. You just have to turn your back and not worry about what's going on. Yeah. What do I do? Just unlock the bathroom window a couple of minutes before eight o'clock tonight. The time is important. Right before eight o'clock tonight, you unlock the bathroom window. That way, maybe you'll get to live a couple of years more. No, sir! Not me, Mr Hallett. If you just gotta move somebody back to the city jail, fine, but it's not gonna be me. This isn't my idea, | was ordered to do it. Look, I don't care who ordered you to do it. What with the streets below crawling with killers, and you wanna eject me from my showers and room service here for a small, iron room with only bars for comfort? No, Mr Hallett. And in case you weren't listening, no. You're a prisoner. And you'll do exactly as you're told. Only if what I'm told to do is to go back to my nice, safe prison, where I spent so many years without being shot at or wounded even once. Well, what possible difference could it make to you whether you're moved there or to the city jail? Because moving to the city jail is closer to the withess stand, which is exactly the last place in the world I've decided I'm gonna be. -So that's really it, then, isn't it? -Yeah. Doesn't make any difference about the city jail. You've simply decided that, as far as you're concerned, everybody else can go hang. You mean, I've been keeping this a secret from you?! You've been doing nothing but stalling until you could take another shower or, er... chisel another $20 meal. Look, who dragged who from prison? Is it my secret police that dragged you from your nice, safe prison and forced ya to live in front of live ammunition for two days? What's all this supposed to mean? | want outta here! But alive! And I'm not gonna testify, even if you give me -gold plates on silver platters! -(KNOCKING AT DOOR) -(DOOR OPENING) -Hello, Vince. She has it in her power to get rid of one of the biggest menaces this country has ever seen, but she simply won't do it. That's right, and, futhermore, | want that menace to start hearin' that I'm not gonna do anything about it. And I want headlines in all the newspapers to say I'm not gonna do anything about it! So nothing in the world really matters to you except your own precious hide? -VINCE: Take it easy, Lloyd. -Oh, take it easy nothing! This is the kind of selfishness that turns my stomach. "Me, me, me! What's gonna happen to me?" She doesn't care if the world burns down as long as the flames don't touch her! -Calm down. -Oh, let's don't stall. It doesn't take long for a bullet to go through a brain! Well... weren't you a help out there? Instead of yanking me away, why didn't you pitch in and help? Because I think she's been pitched at enough. -Oh, you do? -Yes, I do. Look, she almost got killed last night. On top of that, you've been sluggin' at her with everything from fancy meals to your tellin' her how low she is. Well, maybe I feel that way. Maybe you haven't got any right to. It's her life, you know. You've been working just as long as I have on this case. And, to all appearances, you felt just as strongly as I have about getting Costain. What's happened to change you all of a sudden? Maybe I'm gettin' fed up with all the shooting that's been goin' on. They killed Pete Tonelli, and they shot Willoughby. Now, we've gotta take her to city jail. You're just giving me a lot more good reasons why we have to get Costain! Well, they might be reasons to us, but that doesn't mean they are to her. She's the one that's got to get up on that witness stand -with her neck stickin' out, y"know. -Well, I'll shed a few tears. How'd you happen to find out about this move to the city jail? -(PHONE RINGING) -What... Whaddaya mean? | just finished talking to Sherry just a minute ago. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -She's the only one I said a word... MASTERS: Mr Hallett, phone. All right. And while you're sittin' there phonin', you can tell the newspapers the status. All right. There goes our last chance. Vince. I'm... I'm sorry. Maybe you coulda been police chief, or... a senator from some place if I coulda gotten up enough courage. Don't worry about it. -Thanks. -(REPLACING RECEIVER) VINCE: What's the matter? Willoughby died twenty minutes ago. They thought she was rallying, but... Oh, no. She must have been trying to drag me out of the way when she got hit. And she didn't even say anything... until the doc was through with me. Me. Me. The kinda person you could lose any day in the week, and it still wouldn't make any difference. (GASPING) And who's gonna take care of her daughter? (TUTTING) Who does that crazy jerk think he is, anyway? Killin' off nice people like Willoughby. You know, he better be careful, 'cause somebody just might run him out of this country, where he really belongs. And I think I know who that somebody's gonna be. Hey, now, wait a minute... Mr Hallett, you just got yourself a witness. Y'know, friends, 'cause it's Sunday night here, and I'm still a-goin' strong, some of my enemies have started a rumour that I haven't been on the job every minute, that I been kinda catchin' catnaps during the news bulletins. Now, you folks know me better than that. | just don't play that kind of dirty mahjong... Fred. Boy, that's really rotten news about Willoughby, isn't it? Yeah. | wonder how many more we'll lose in this move to the jail? Look, there's some more guys comin' over, you'll have to show 'em what you want 'em to do. Right. You wanna make a bet that she never gets to the city jail alive? | was only kidding, Vince. Forget it. (OLD TIME FIDDLE MUSIC ON TV) Masters? -Yeah? -What's Conley doin' now? Changing her clothes for the trip to the jail. She says if there's gonna be a lot of shooting, she doesn't wanna take a chance with her new dress. -Yeah? -It's Vince. Can I come in? Sure, I'm decent enough for you. | was hoping I'd get a chance to see you before D-Day starts. -It's another let-out job. -Yeah. Listen, how do you know Willoughby wants you to get up on that stand? Well, why shouldn't she want me to help get the guy that killed her? Well, she'd have been able to see that all you'll do is get yourself killed. | suppose that, in all the years Mr Costain's been a hotshot, there've been lots of people that could've stopped him along the way. But, for some reason, nobody ever did, so... now, the buck has been passed right on down to... Yeah, but you don't want it, you didn't ask for it. -But I got it, so what am I gonna do? -Look, who says it's up to you, anyway? Well, Mr Hallett keeps ea yin' it all along, and... | guess right now I'm ea yin' it myself. -SHERRY: What're you doin'? -VINCE: Checking everything. SHERRY: Even if we're gonna move me? VINCE: We've still got half an hour. Sherry, don't do it. Oh, don't worry about me, Vince. | know what I'm getting into. No, you don't. Well, let's say it's ten times worse than I think it is now. I'd still go ahead with it because, for the first time in my life, I'm facin® up to somethin'. | Kinda like the feelin'. Anyway, the nicest thing that ever happened to me is that you care whether I live or die. | don't expect you to feel this way for the rest of your life, or... or even five days from now, but... | would just like to tell you that... | think it's nice that you feel that way now. Maybe this isn't exactly the time, but... | just wanted to tell you. Vince. - I wish you wouldn't be sore at me. -For what? For feelin' this way about ya. | wouldn't hold ya to anything after this is over. I'm not sore. What with this move to the city jail, maybe this'll be our last chance to say anything.

Shouldn't that door be open? Well, she's been screamin' about not gettin' any privacy when she's dressing. Well, |, er... | thought she might like a hat to go with that dress that you, er...

Well, you wouldn't be worried if you were taking care of her yourself, would you? Why don't you leave her alone! What's the matter, Vince?
