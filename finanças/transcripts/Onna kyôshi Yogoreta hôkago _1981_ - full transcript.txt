Hello, Kurata residence. Sakiko Kurata, the teacher? Of Municipal High School #1? Yes, that's right. I'm the Youth Officer at city hall. I'd like to ask some questions regarding your student, Sueko Nomoto. Hello? Hello? Yes, I'm here. I don't really know how I can help. I'm not her homeroom teacher. I don't really know any student named Nomoto. Yes. Yes. Yes. I understand. I should come down to your office, then? Right. Female Teacher Dirty Afternoon Who was that? The police. They say a student of mine was involved with a group... ...that was smoking marijuana and huffing paint thinner. Metro high schools have delinquents, too? Yuki Kazamatsuri Ayako Ã”ta Eri Kanuma Noboru Mitani Hiroko Fuji I wonder why she asked for me? What? I don't know that student at all. I hate going to police stations. I don't want to go! I don't want to go! I don't want to go! They said they suspected you of prostitution. Is that true? It wasn't prostitution. I didn't take any money. So it's true that you went to a hotel with a man? Yes. You just went because he chatted you up on the street, then? Hardly. It's like the detective said. Maybe I'm just into that kind of thing. But that's not true. I've given my body to men lots of times because it made them happy. But to me, it's no big deal. You don't like it? I haven't been to all that many hotels. There aren't many nice people. So those dope smokers were nice people? In a 9 by 12 studio apartment, men and women who were like vagrants live together. It was a weird sensation. They lock themselves up in the closet all day. They're addlebrained from the drugs. It's no wonder they're as timid as rabbits. The police are like their boogeyman. So they live in the closet, huffing thinner, saying it's so the cops won't find them. They got caught in the end, but they were nice people. Nice? How so? They would patiently listen to what you had to say, just like a teacher. Are you teasing me? Why would I do that? She says that I once taught her at a branch school up in the mountains. I don't remember her, but that's why she gave them my name. The mountains? I went to a place called Sakata Mines in Akita. It's a mountain where they mine industrial ores. In college, I asked to do my student teaching at a middle school there. She must have been one of my students then. Ah, this is her. She went to a hotel with a guy, huh? It hasn't even been six months since she transferred from her school there. I don't understand girls these days. What are you looking at? I think that naked girls wearing glasses is erotic, that's all. You're terrible. - Don't run away. - Bathroom break. You hail from Akita, too, don't you? Yes, right next to Sakata Mines. I lived in town, though. That's why I forced them to let me teach there. It would've been a waste for you to stay in the mountains. You're too gorgeous. No! Please, stop... Please, stop... What's wrong? Hey, what's gotten into you? What is it? Hey! I'm cold! I'm so cold! Do something! Please! You're crazy, Sakiko. Kurata-sensei's gone off her rocker today. I'm insane today. My horny side is feeling restless. The cold mountain winds are blowing inside me. Sueko Nomoto got good grades back at her prefectural school. Here's her transcript. She has plenty of issues at home. Her father was a miner at a place called Sakata Mines, but there was an incident, and he wasn't able to go down into the mine anymore. - Incident? - Yes. Sexual assault. After that, they moved to an apartment in Akita City, while the father went to work in Tokyo at a construction site. They managed to make ends meet, but before long, he went and... That's one troublesome dad. How do you mean? He was hooking up with some woman at a bar. She was running a migrant worker scam, caused some trouble, then vanished. So then Sueko and her mother came to Tokyo and are being supported... by her older sister, who's an office worker here. That's the long and short of it. Be my guest, take a look. Apparently, he raped a college student who was in town as a student teacher. Suekichi Nomoto This is the man. His body smelled of paint thinner. Chocolate cake, huh? It looks good. Want some? It's on me. I'd like to talk to you over a cup of coffee. I'd like that. I've had my eye on you for a while. You'd cross the street from the station and look at the posters at the theater. Then you'd stroll into the boutique there. You'd come out, then peek into the watch store for a long time. Right? I wasn't looking at watches. I could see you in the mirror. I knew that you would talk to me, so I waited for you. You set a trap for me, huh? What do you do for a living? What do I look like? A beach ball maker? A beach ball maker... They come up to me all the time, asking me if I want to be a model. Oh, I see. I'd never use a line like, "Do you want to model for me?" Want to do it? You're after my body. Boy, that sure killed the mood. There's lots of people like that. I'd like to. I do. Will you let me? Will you let me tell you a story? Sure. After they dig out the ore, a valley is left behind. It got turned into a garbage dump while work was stopped there. I see. Dump trucks come from the city, bringing in garbage. Sounds filthy. We looked forward to it. Because city trash has things like dolls and usable electronics in it. When they start dumping, the mountain kids raise a cheer and run over. They're running in search of treasure. Students in metro schools couldn't understand that kind of happiness. I guess not. I still have a doll that I found back then. It's called a "French doll." It has blue eyes and blonde hair. But one of the eyes is cracked. It has cracks running through it. It looks like it's crying. I bet that's why it was thrown out. Poor thing. - Oh, and I also-- - Come on! Would you please be quiet? You've been talking nonstop since we started. Don't you feel anything? Are you frigid? I feel it. It makes me feel happy, that's why I'm telling you this story. Listen. You're supposed to go, "I'm coming" or "Oh, God" or even, "Please stop." Feelings like what you said just now... It's no good. I guess it's not working for me. Are you kidding me? You've got such a great body. That's impossible! You really don't want any money? I'm not selling my body. Will I always run into you at that station? Even if you do, that doesn't mean I'll sleep with you. You're not as nice as I thought you were. You're a green pepper. You're empty on the inside. That'll be 43 yen. - Keep the change. - Thank you. This is inexcusable. That girl bought at least 5000 yen worth of food just now. It was careless of me. I'm sorry. Careless? I can tell. That girl is your daughter, isn't she? Come to my office later. This is high-quality meat. I bet it cost a fortune. Not really. I got caught after you left. It got ugly. We're in the red again this month, so cut down on the food bill, okay? Food in Tokyo is the best. We never had meat like this back home. Tomoko, beer. Made any friends at school? Metro schools are advanced. Don't fall behind. You're looking for an apartment, right? I am, but it's difficult. Difficult or no, will you please move out? I'll help out if you need a little money. I suppose so... I can't take it anymore. You've been freeloading in my studio apartment for six months. I have my own life to live. I understand. I do, but there's nothing I can do. Anyway, I want you gone. I can't have you mooching off me forever. I understand. I understand, all right. Just support yourself, see if I care! Act innocent when Sueko and I end up dead in a ditch, see if I care! I understand! Nobody told you to die. You've got a double bed in this little studio! You used to drag men back here! And now that you can't, you're throwing a fit! Mom! What's gotten into you? I'm not a whore, got it? I'm a proud employee of Benibaru-- Sueko, get that. Nomoto residence. Oh, Sensei. Yes. Yes, that's fine. Yes, ma'am. - Who was that? - My teacher at school. - Are you in trouble again? - None of your business. The rapist was a vagrant from Tokyo. A thinner addict. That's a bald-faced lie. - It's the truth. - Do you have any proof? I don't like your tone of voice. I'm the person you named as your guardian. And you're the daughter of Suekichi Nomoto, the man who assaulted me. These two facts worry me. My father didn't assault you. Call the Akita police to confirm that for yourself. Oh, that assault at Sakata Middle School? Suekichi Nomoto... No, the real guy struck again six months later. Oh, what was his name... He was a vagrant. Hello? What did you say your name was? He attacked you, and then he struck again. But this time, he got nabbed before he could finish. Well, it put a postscript to everything. When my dad had a day off, he'd go into town and help at a paint store. That's where he picked up the smell of thinner. He smelled the same as the vagrant, didn't he? What a terrible case of mistaken identity... It's all right. You were the victim. I want to apologize to your father. Can I see him? I suppose, but I don't think that meeting him will do any good. Cut it out already. That's bad for you. Those people who were arrested were huffers. They had this thin trail of drool hanging down. Keep it up, and you'll end up in a mental hospital. Is everybody doing okay? Yeah. They're fine. Mom's putting on a little weight. Sis is still snooty about working for a first-class company. She is, huh? Will you come back? Mom and I will have to get an apartment of our own before long. If you're going to come back, that might be your chance. - I don't think I have a shot. - You don't? No, I don't. Even if you don't, don't you think it might work out anyway? I don't think I have a shot. Oh. You don't think you have a shot. Welcome! Sorry I'm late. I was swamped with a ton of clients. - Whiskey and water. - Coming right up. - You don't look so good. - I did something terrible. Now what? What's wrong? You can tell me. I can't talk about it here. I'm floored. I had no idea that something like that happened to you. It's a bit of a shock. By involving Sueko Nomoto's family, it's like I have two pasts. I thought I was the victim, but before I knew it, I'd become the assailant. It's all a jumble now. I don't know how I can even begin to wrap my head around that. That's why you told me your secret? You want to force me to share your past, too. Don't do that to me. A burden like that is way too heavy for me to shoulder for you. That means that you can't be with me. Am I right? You learn about the real me, and now you're getting ready to run away. How can we have a relationship like that? You're really taking this hard. You don't need to beat yourself up over it. Don't overthink relationships. A physical relationship. A relationship that's just physical. That's what you want, isn't it? Sounds like I got the truth out of you. I feel the same. I want your body, too. Just your body. You've changed. Ever since you went to claim that girl. You're different. How were you feeling when he took you? How did you look when you were raped? Was it good? Did you feel anything? Who was better, me or him? Well? Who was better? Do you remember me? I'm Sakiko Kurata. I brought money. It isn't much, but it's all I could scrape together. I know it won't settle things, but it's the only way I have to make amends. Please accept it. You don't have anything to atone for. It's too much. - You're putting me on the spot. - Nomoto-san. It's in the past, I've forgotten it. We've both left that city behind, you and me. I insist. I can't simply brush aside what I've done. I don't mean to be rude, but please accept this money. I should take it? Well, thanks for being so considerate. Allow me. This happened when Sueko was in the 7th grade, if I remember right. She had a wild rabbit as a pet that she'd caught on the mountain. I cooked it for dinner. It was attacked and killed by a weasel, and I couldn't let it go to waste, so I threw it into the pot with the sukiyaki, and we all ate it together. Sueko-san, too? Later, when she found out that it was her pet rabbit, she said I'd gone too far this time. She went funny in the head after that. She'd talk to this doll that she found at the garbage dump, and her communication skills with people went downhill. That's terrible, cooking an animal that a little girl loved. But it would have been even worse to just throw it out! We hardly ever got the chance to eat meat back then. They sent me home because of lack of evidence or whatever, but as far as the world was concerned, I was a criminal who'd raped a woman. I couldn't exactly go down to the market to buy meat. This is horrible. I really am the cause of all your troubles. No, no, not at all. We're both victims. No hard feelings. Okay, Sensei? Here. Eat up. More... - Deeper. - How do I go deeper? I'm embarrassed... It's okay... Endo-san... - Tomoko... - Deeper... Deeper... Okay... It's deep, it's deep... Okay... It's okay, it's okay... It's deep, right? I can't hold it in! So, will you lay it out for me? Lay what out? Will you marry me or won't you? I will! That's what you want, right? But... What's the problem? Will you move me up from part-time? Will you make me full-time? Fine, fine. Haven't I been covering for you all this time? I know you've been using our goods to stretch your food budget. Haven't I been turning a blind eye all this time? Right? If you're just toying with me, you'll regret it! I know, I know. You'll really promote me? - I'm so winded... - That makes two of us, damn it... I see you! I see what you're doing! I saw you! I saw you! Sorry for asking you all the way out here. It's okay. - You needed to see me? - Yes. Men are so strange. Why do they get so attached to you just because you gave them your body? Give them your body once, and they think they know everything about you. Like giving your body makes everything clear. It might just be a delusion, but it is pretty soothing. Even if it's only for a bit. It's nice. I could get hooked on it. Man-aholism. What about you? I get the feeling that you're the same kind of person as me. Someone who can only connect with others by giving her body. You came here to tell me that? No. To return this. I met with my dad yesterday. He said he had money for me. This was what he gave me. I don't have any right to it. But it's a token of how I feel. I can't express my feelings unless I put them into tangible form. You've made them clear. You're the only one who can make me talk this much. I don't hold any grudges against you. Honest! Do you know where Nomoto-san is today? I didn't see him downstairs. Nomoto? He quit. The company people saw him huffing disposable paint thinner. Canned him. That's why he-- I'll be playing mahjong. To butter up a client. We won't be done until 2 or 3AM. Hello? Are you listening? - Why are you avoiding me? - Excuse me? If you're tired of me, come out and say it. I can tell that we've been drifting apart ever since that night. Look, I'm at the office. I can't talk about that stuff-- I'm more trouble than you thought I was, so you're panicking. You have second thoughts because if you stay with me, you think you'll be trapped. I'm playing mahjong tonight. It's for work. Can you understand that? Hello? Sakiko? Hello? Hello? Excuse me, I have this extra ticket, and was wondering-- I was stood up by my friend. He left me in the lurch. You came at the perfect time, so I spoke up. Rather rudely. Am I coming on too strong? Join me for some tea? This is your first time doing this? Strange, isn't it? I'm roasting alive... I'll take those. These are done up pretty tight, aren't they? One of my girl students goes into town to look for men. I didn't understand why at first. But now, here I am, doing the same thing. Hey! What's your problem? I'm talking to you! Hey! Come back here! Damn it... Nomoto-san! Let's run! Let's run way together! - So, where shall we go? - I don't know. Akita? I don't want to go anywhere. I'm fine, you use it. Why did you do that? It shocked me. No reason. He'd been drinking in the middle of the day, and he got rough. I was minding my own business, and he up and hits me. When I said it hurt, he started pounding away at me. And then? And then I lost it. So that's why you clubbed him. You have a scary side. Nomoto-san! Nomoto-san! Nomoto-san, are you all right? Where is Sueko? Sueko-san? She isn't on the train. Sueko isn't here? Come back here! Say your prayers! What do you scoundrels think you're doing? Face me instead! Today begins my journey as a criminal! - Are you a visitor? - My name is Nomoto. Ah, Nomoto-san, we've been waiting for you. Your room is this way. A visitor is here to see you. Go right in. I wasn't sure if you would come. He's sleeping now. There's no fever, but the doctor says that he's very weak. I'm sorry to put you to all this trouble. I have to say, you two make a strange couple. What's going on? Dad's body is a mess. His work in the mountains was tough, but when he left to find work, the factories and construction sites he worked at were even worse. That's where he got himself kicked out of the race. Booze and women, that's the usual mix for self-destruction when that happens. He's a mess because he was huffing by himself when he fell on hard times. I wanted him to enjoy himself. He said he'd been here once. He said he had a good time. He said that's why he wanted to come here one more time. He did? It was like he was hanging on by a thread. It seemed so sad. Thank you for waiting. We will now begin our Guest Hour. Anyone with confidence in their voice, feel free to come up. We'd like you to treat the crowd to your best songs. Anyone? The gentleman over there! Step right up! Watch your step! Here's the mic! A round of applause! Don don pan pan, don pan pan! Don don pan pan, don pan pan! Do do pa pa, do do pa pa, don pan pan! Looking out at your faces, I have to laugh. Looking at your faces, I see they're all different. If I had the same face as everyone else, I wouldn't know my own face. That was great. I loved the show you guys put on! Thank you. Good one. Excuse me. It's not much, but I hope you like it. Thanks for being so considerate. - Thank you. - I'll make tea, too. Here we go. Ready? So sorry, I'm going to take an extra tip from you. Got the blue slip! This isn't my day... What a great hand. - Here. - Thanks. - Here, miss. - So, what do you want to do? Another game! You're stoked, pops! Okay, come on! I'll get that red strip again. - Here you are. - Thank you. Try this! - Here. - Thanks. No good. - Right, then... - Here goes. Okay. Here goes. - How about this? - You got me. You have a sweet side, I see. How about this? Lady Luck's turning my way! You're in a good mood! Thank you. How long do you plan to stay? - Tomorrow is our last show here. - Tomorrow? We're playing in Jouban next. It's a huge theater. You're leaving tomorrow? So, you're leaving... Nomoto-san! You're killing yourself? I've driven you to this! I'm so sorry! I've come this far with you, so I'll join you in this, too! - It has nothing to do with you. - Even so. It has nothing to do with you. Don't die! I'm scared! I'm so scared! I'm so scared... - Dad. - Nomoto-san! It's all right! It'll be all right! I'm scared! It's all right. I'm scared! - It's all right! - I'm scared! It's all right! - I'm scared... - It'll be all right! It's all right. You can take it out on me. You can torment me. I feel it so strongly... We've been on the road ever since that day. We're surprisingly happy. Dad's in high spirits, and has given up huffing. When I'm with Dad, my feelings are more composed. They're not all over the place like they used to be. We're both flawed people. When we're together, we seem to compensate for each other's flaws. So anyway, it looks like I'll be taking care of him for a while. P.S. I submitted a leave of absence form at school and everything. When I come back to school, I hope you-- Starring: Yuki Kazamatsuri Ayako Ã”ta Eri Kanuma Yuusuke Koike Noboru Mitani I'm cold.
