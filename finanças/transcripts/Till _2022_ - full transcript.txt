Bo, when you get down there... Oh, not again, Mama. I've already been to Mississippi. Only one time before, and you started a fight with another little boy. He was picking on me. You're in the right to stand up for yourself, but that's not what I'm talking about. Well, they have a different set of rules for Negroes down there. Are you listening? Yes. You have to be extra careful with White people. You can't risk looking at them the wrong way. I know. Bo. Be small down there. Like this? Instead of your father's ring, how about you wear the cufflinks we got you last Christmas? They'll look so handsome on you. No, Mama. I wanna wear the ring. Thank you. Go on downstairs. I need to finish getting ready myself. Ah, morning, Mamie! Morning, Preacher. Good morning, Wheeler. Hi, Miss Mamie. Hi, Bo. You're leaving Chicago too soon. You were only here a few days. I didn't need no more days than that. I got to see some family, a few friends. Maybe we get you to come down... - see us. - All aboard! I like it just fine out here, Preacher. All right, now. Bo, stay close to your cousins. Preacher, you and Aunty Lizzie make sure Bo calls and writes every chance he gets. I need to know he's okay. Don't worry. Me, Lizzie, and the boys will have a stern eye on him. Goodbye, Mamie. All right, now. Come on, Bobo. Buh-bye, Mama. Oh, Bo! You didn't kiss me goodbye. Mama. I gotta go. Listen to Preacher. Stay with your cousins at all times. Be extra careful. I already know. You know what? I won't need to keep the time on my vacation. Wind it every day. Last call! Train's leaving! Buh-bye, Mama. Come on, Bobo. Aight, Mamie. Time to move now. Now, all you gotta do is pinch the bract right here, so you don't get your fingertips... Hey, look at the size of that bird. Whoa! Where'd you get that ring? Oh, it was my daddy's. He died a hero in the war. Well, let me try it on. Um, maybe later. All right. - Bo? - Is he all right? Bobo! Come on. Roar! From the depths of an ancient tomb, echoes a sound that shakes the world. Meet the mummy, Simmy! Stop! You gonna get us in trouble. Or better yet, fired. I'm done picking these fields. What do y'all do with all this cotton anyway? We sell it. Mr. Frederick, who own the land, take his share. I go to market with our haul. - Sounds pretty square. - Hmm. Pa, you gonna let him sass you that way? What way? The boy doesn't know where his clothes come from. Nah. I take it back, Bobo. Stay off the farm. City boy won't even know how he found a whuppin'. Yes, he is. Damn near pass out. Come on, sit down. Sit down, come on. Hey, young boy. How you doin' there, young fella? Come on, learn somethin'. Well, I'm about raised from the dead by all this excitement. Pay attention here, you gonna let us learn you something. I'll make damn sure. I'mma do what I do. Thank you, ma'am. You look like a movie star. What? Where's Bobo? He's in there. Simmy. See to Bobo while he's inside. See? Come on. Bye! Buh-bye! - Come on, let's go! - Yeah? She getting her gun. She getting her gun, y'all. Come on! Move! - Get up, now! Come on! - Move! Move! She goin' to get a gun, y'all! - Get in! - Just lay low. Come on, Mau! Why aren't you at work? Is everything okay? That trip we planned to take Bo on? Let's go now. You wanna go right now? You said you weren't feeling that well. I was just missing Bo. I'm still missing Bo. We have never been apart this long, and he's gonna be gone another week. I need to keep doing things to take my mind off of this feelin'. Okay. I can't go right now, but, uh, we'll try in a few days. Promise me we'll go on the trip? Of course. I'm trying not to act so silly! Better watch yourself. I don't know, 'cause when he looks at me, I just lose my mind! Oh! But just be yourself. Okay. I'll try. It's gonna be all right. Oh! Nice try. It's a high-speed competition, huh? They call you city boy, or somethin'? Think you so damn funny, huh? Why you whistle like that? Look, it's been three days, okay? And we haven't heard nothin' more about what I did in Money. That's 'cause no one knows your face 'round here. That don't mean they not in one of 'em cars looking for us. Look, I said I was sorry. We gotta tell Pappa. We all agreed we wouldn't say anything. He'll make Bobo go home. So what? You don't see what's been going on around here? They killin' Negroes for doing way less than what you did in Money. You ain't no White man, Bobo. You one of us! Hey, leave him alone, Maurice. Mrs. Bryant must've kept it to herself. No one has to know. Willie Mae, Ollie, I swear you two are losing on purpose. Yeah, well, you must have all the luck tonight, Mamie. Mm-hmm. Now, we've been here all night, and you still haven't told us what's bothering you. I'm fine. I got a letter today from Aunty Lizzie. She said Bo is really happy. That's all I needed to hear. Mm. - That's real good, Mamie. - -Mm-hmm. My boy, Curtis, just made it down to Mississippi. I already told Uncle, "Make sure he see Bo tomorrow." Bo would like that. Yeah. It'd be nice for him to have another friend... - from the city there with him. - -Mm-hmm. Oh, he just doesn't understand how different things are down there. Yeah. Aunty Lizzie said Bo's been working the fields. Oh! I can't imagine Bo in the hot sun all day pulling some cotton. No. But Aunty Lizzie said I raised one nice, hardworking boy. - That's my Bo. - Yes. Can't believe he's been gone a week. Gene and I wanna take a trip soon, but I really wanna go down to Mississippi and bring my son home. If Bo could just get his feet back onto the Chicago soil, he'd be one happy kid. I... I don't know why I said that. Looks like your little winning streak is over, Mamie. Well, look at that. You wanna play one more hand? Sure. But you deal this time. Absolutely. You still gonna lose. These cards, girl. A grand jury has declined to indict the suspect for the murder of Reverend George Washington Lee, a Mississippi Negro man killed while driving his car. Lee lead the Belzoni, Mississippi NAACP in his efforts to register hundreds of Negroes to vote for the first time. Pappa, you and Mama ain't asleep? Mm. How can we sleep when y'all ain't home yet? What'd you boys get into tonight? Nothing much, Daddy. Just taking Bobo around. Mm. All right. Night, Ma. Night, Pa. - Good night. - Night night. Good night. Bobo! We leaving early tomorrow to mail that letter out to your mama, you hear? Okay. Good night. Good night. That was close. After having registered dozens of Negroes to vote in the local runoff election. No charges have been made. Preacher! Preacher! Who is it? It's Mr. Bryant. I wanna talk to you about that boy. Sir? I want that boy who did the talking down in Money. Talking, sir? What talking? Open up this door, Preacher! Bobo! You better open up this door, Preacher! Bobo! Wake up! Leave me alone. Get up! Someone's come! You know who I'm talking about! So what? They've come for you! I don't know. Who's come? I don't know what you mean, Mr. Bryant. You got that boy from Chicago. You that big mouth nigger? Who are you? Get your clothes on. Mr. Bryant, you ain't got to do this. He just a young boy. Better shut them eyes. - Oh! - Simmy! You don't need no goddamn socks, boy. I... I don't wear shoes without socks. Don't talk back to them! We just gonna teach him a lesson. Stay right here, Simmy! - Please! - Move! - Don't take him! - Move! I'll whup him if he's done something wrong! We'll give you money. Watch out. We don't need no money! Please! The boy ain't got good sense. He's gonna learn! But, Mr. Bryant! What'd you say to my brother? All right. Get up. Carolyn! Is this the right nigger? That's the one. All right. Get off me. Shut up, boy! Shut up. All right. Look at me, boy! Hold him down! Watch it, now! Shut your mouth! Come on. Get up! Get up! Hold him up! Hello? Get out of the way, Gene! I gotta get to Money! Money? Money? Mamie, what's going on? They took Bo! - Who took Bo? - I... Preacher told me two men came and got Bo last night. I couldn't hear anything else after that. - I gotta find Bo! - Mamie! Mamie! Mamie! Mamie, let's go inside, call your mama, try and get in touch with Preacher and Aunty Lizzie for more information, okay? Come on. Come on. We give you all the glory, Lord. - Glory to God. - Yes. Glory to God. Yes, Lord. Glory to God. - Yes. - Mm-hmm. He's going to bring him back to you, baby. Yes, ma'am. Alma. Thank you. Mamie. Alma. You weren't going to tell me? I called your wife. No matter the differences between me and your mother, I'm still your father. Mamie, we're gonna find Bo. - Mm. - Sit down. I brought your cousin along to help us. Do you remember Rayfield? Rayfield Mooty. Came by the house a lot when you was a kid. He works with some powerful Negro people who can help us find Bo. It's been a long time, ma'am. - Nice to see you again. - Mm. Mamie. Oh. I'm sorry. Thank you for coming, Mr. Mooty. I've, uh... I've been in touch with Mr. William Huff, counsel for the NAACP chapter here in Chicago. He wants to meet with you first thing tomorrow morning. I've included the address to his office. Here. He has political connections throughout the state of Mississippi. And he's in regular contact with Mayor Daley, Congressman Dawson, and Governor Stratton. I do know the NAACP, and it sounds like he knows the right people who can help me find Bo. Well, I'll meet you in Mr. Huff's office tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. - Thanks, Ray. - Mm-hmm. I will see you soon. Hey. ♪ At last the leader turned around and said ♪ ♪ Listen, Pops, you had better stop ♪ ♪ Oh, there you go, you did it again ♪ ♪ You just beeped when you should have bopped ♪ It's on your calendar, and you have the meeting right after that. Morning! Hi, John. How are you today? Mr. Huff, this is Mrs. Bradley. Thank you for meeting with us, Mr. Huff. - And Mr. Mobley. - Yes, thank you. I have great respect for your cousin. His work with the United Steelworkers has helped to make it one of the strongest Negro unions. - I didn't know that. - Mm-hmm. Are you employed? I work for the Air Force. She's the only Negro woman in the office. Mrs. Bradley. You two aren't married? Um... No. Not yet, anyway. Where's Emmett's father? Louis Till died overseas about 10 years ago. Uh, during the war. And Mr. Bradley? You have a lot of questions for me, Mr. Huff. And none of them seem to have anything to do with my son. I've been briefed on your case. Bo is not a case. I've drafted two telegrams to send. One to Governor White in Mississippi. The other to Governor Stratton, here in Illinois. It's important they know about Emmett. We're currently investigating the murders of Lamar Smith and Reverend Lee. They did a lot of work getting Negroes registered to vote. Because of what happened to them, the Negro press in Mississippi started to write about Emmett's kidnapping, but it's not creating enough pressure needed to force them into a state-wide search. Now, as your counsel, I'd like to utilize all of the press here in Chicago. It's more likely to get picked up by other cities that way. You're gonna have to talk to reporters, speak in front of cameras. So... we like to make sure that the person who's telling the story is in public favor. It's better that I ask you questions now than some reporter finding something later. The reverend and Mr. Lee, I heard they were killed right before Bo got down there. Mamie... I know these Citizen Councils are everywhere in Mississippi. You think they had a part in any of it? When the message to White people is to stop Negroes from voting or advancing, by any means short of violence, it's only a matter of time before someone doesn't stop short of it. Let's just focus on finding Bo. Why do you call him "Bo"? When I was carrying him, my mama's friend would bring him gifts all the time, and say, "Here's another one for little Bobo." After he was born, it just stuck. He was a perfect baby. Born breech, and had his share of problems, but... he was a perfect baby. Hi, we live across the street and read about what happened to Emmett. Everybody in the neighborhood knows that sweet little boy. But maybe somebody will read the paper, and they'll know Bo's ours. I don't care what anyone thinks Bo did or did not do in that store. They took my child, and I need him back. Hello? Mr. Huff! Yes, yes, yes. I'll get Mamie. Sounds like he has good news. Mr. Huff? He wrote back? The governor wants to talk to Mr. Huff about what happened to Bo. Thank you. Thank you for the update, Mr. Huff. Okay. I'll be in touch. A reporter called me. He didn't wanna tell you himself. Bo's body was found in a river. Preacher just identified him to the sheriff. He... He recognized the ring Bo was wearing. I'm so sorry, Mamie. He's... He's dead. This is a breaking news bulletin. We interrupt this broadcast to report a breaking news story. The body of Emmett Louis Till has been found dead in the Tallahatchie River near Money, Mississippi. Till, a Negro boy from Chicago, was kidnapped while visiting relatives in Money, Mississippi. Again, that breaking news. The body of Emmett Louis Till has been found in Mississippi. We'll have details ahead... and J.W. Milam were already in police custody after admitting to the kidnapping, but they now face possible indictment for the murder of Till. We have proved by two or three witnesses that the body found in Tallahatchie River was that of Emmett Till. We proved that the body had the ring... this lynching that the state of Mississippi has decided to maintain this White supremacy by murdering children. Look, it was because he was a boy, that's why they went there. They had to prove that they were superior. They had to prove it by taking away a 14-year-old boy. Mamie, you need to eat something. The killers of the boy felt free to lynch him because there is, in the entire state... no restraining influence of decency. Hate. It's like a virus in the blood of the Mississippians. They can't help it. That was Roy Wilkins... - the executive director of the NAACP... You mind if I speak with Mamie? Giving his reaction to the recent killing of 14-year-old Negro boy, Emmett Till. Burial preparations by local sheriffs have already started being made in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, where Till's body was found. Mamie? Negro leaders are calling on local and federal officials to investigate the murder, and to indict J.W. Milam... Uh... - My sincere condolences... - Stop. I can't. I need Bo's body sent back here. I can't have him buried in Mississippi. Mississippi won't make that deal with you. Then make them. I'm sure Mr. Huff can get Mayor Daley or the governor to talk to somebody. Those people in Mississippi are trying to dump Bo in the ground like he's just another body. He is my baby. I need to see him. I'll speak with Mr. Huff. Thank you. You know... Mamie, you have the public's attention right now. And, uh, it would be in a politician's best interest to help you during an election year. There's an opportunity in that. Uh... Some organizers and executive members of the NAACP have been speaking with the justice department about creating legislation that would make lynching a federal crime. What happened to Reverend Lee was a lynching. Lamar Smith. A lynching. - Emmett... - I... uh... We have an opportunity to use this moment to help us pass this legislation. Might even help you get an indictment. Maybe even a conviction. I can't think about that right now. I just need Bo's body sent back here. Well, the public's paying attention right now, Mamie. See, this doesn't just have to be about Emmett. Mr. Mooty, my son is dead! Make sure Mr. Huff handles this today. Yes, ma'am. Rayfield's ready to take us to the train station. I, uh, got you a wheelchair. You know, just in case. I don't want you falling down. Preacher called again. He keeps trying to apologize to you, Mamie. Aunty Lizzie's coming up here. He has to stay behind to finish working the fields and talk to the prosecutor. I keep asking myself... "Why is this happening? "Why did he take my child from me? "What am I supposed to do now?" Yeah. I have to say goodbye to Mama. Mama. I'm the one who told him to go down there. I wanted him to go down there. I told him to go down. I told him to go down there. All right. Get that. Oh, my God! My boy! My boy! My only child! My only boy! Oh, my Lord! Get him out of that box! Get him out of the box! Get him out of the box! He can't breathe! He can't breathe. My Lord! Oh, Lord, have mercy! Help me! Oh, my God! Oh, Lord, have mercy! Show me what you want me to do. Oh, Lord, show me what you want me to do and make me able to do it! My Lord! I need to prepare you. Remove the sheet. Oh, God. Everyone, leave us. How long will it take you to turn the body over to us? Figure out the next step. Talk to the church. Gene, can you go back to my place and bring back Emmett's black suit? The one he wore last Christmas. Mama can tell you exactly where it is. And make sure to get my black dress that Bo would approve of. And his matching tie. Emmett loved this suit. It's how he'd like to be seen. Seen? Mamie, Bo's in no kind of shape to be seen by anybody. No, he's in just the right shape. The whole world has to see what happened to my son. Mrs. Bradley, can I at least fix him up a bit? Just to make him more... No one's going to believe what I just saw. No. They have to see it for themselves. Ms. Bradley, what would you like to say to the men who did this? What's that smell? That smell is my son's body. He came home to me reeking of racial hatred. His face was bludgeoned. His teeth are gone. He was shot in the head. And now I want America to bear witness. Come with me, please. Right here, Ms. Bradley. Ms. Bradley, right here. Do you have a message for the perpetrators? Will there be a service, Ms. Bradley? Gene, please come be with me. News of an open-casket funeral for the slain 14-year-old Emmett Till has spread throughout the country. Many people were in shock over the brutal slaying and couldn't believe something like this could happen to a child. My heart goes out to her. I'm a mother too. It could be any one of us. The right thing is to show America, and the world, exactly what happened. We know the boy was killed, but you're making a freak show of his death. I think she brave. Can't we just grieve in peace? This stuff ain't gonna stop till we see it. I support her. It is my opinion that the guilt begins with Mrs. Bryant... and I wanna see Mrs. Bryant punished, those two men punished, and any other persons who were in on this thing. The pressure should start from the president of the United States, all the way down to the township of Money, Mississippi. I won't rest until that happens, even if I have to go to Money, Mississippi myself. Do you have any evidence bearing on this case? I do know that this is my son. You're not just my Bo anymore. Mamie... Aunty Lizzie. Simmy and Maurice stayed back with their daddy. It was probably too much. I'm so sorry. When those men came, I tried. We all tried. I ain't going back, Mamie. I packed my stuff up, and I'm staying here for good. Preacher and the boys will join me. I can't look, Mamie. We have to. ♪ When peace like a river ♪ I'm sorry, Ms. Mamie. ♪ Attendeth my way ♪ Bo...

Carolyn Bryant is going to be fine. You know, to get a murder indictment on two White men in Mississippi is not easy. You did that, Mamie. Now... Their defense... is going to try to create doubt about the body being Emmett's. There's no body, there's no murder conviction, and Bryant and Milam will only face kidnapping charges. You know your child better than anyone. You saw the body soon after. There is no testimony like a mother's. Aren't we going to your mama's tonight? I need to go to Mississippi for the trial. I can testify that it was Bo's body found in the river. When do you want us to go? Gene, I have to go without you. - What? - Mr. Mooty has arranged for me to meet some people - down there. - If you're going to Mississippi, - I'm going with you. - Mr. Huff and Mr. Mooty don't think that's a good idea, - and I agree with them. - I don't care what they think! They keep telling us what to do and who you can talk to. And I go along with it because I lost Bo too. I would do anything for him. You tell me, Mamie. How is risking your life gonna help Bo? This is what they're writing about me down there. They're making me out to be some kind of jezebel. Two reporters called to ask about my ex-husbands and about you. Mr. Huff was right. I'm on trial like the people who killed Bo. Jurors will be watching me, and reading these stories when they decide if the men who murdered my son go free. I have to protect my image if it can help get justice for Bo. I should be going with you, Mamie. I need you to be there for me in a different way right now. You're not gonna change your mind? You know me well enough to answer that question for yourself. Not since the Tallahatchie River flooded some 20 or 30 years ago that the townspeople had more to talk about than this trial. I can't understand how a civilized mother could put a dead body of her child on public display! I think that this is a result of the NAACP trying to make something big... out of just an ordinary criminal affair in Mississippi. You're not going. Mamie, it's too dangerous for you to go down to Mississippi right now. I heard the sheriffs are passing along Negro license plate numbers to the Klan members. Mr. Huff and Mr. Mooty already have plans for me to safely travel. I'll fly to Memphis first. And then, some people from the NAACP are going to drive me to Clarksdale. And then, their field secretary will pick me up and drive me to someone's house in a place called Mound Bayou. You want to go alone? I'm trying to be strong for Bo. What are you gonna do down there? Something you can't. If my testimony can help in any way, I have to go. I have to be there for my child. And what about my child? I'm goin' with ya. I know this is not what we agreed on, but it's better for me to go down there with her than for her to be there alone. You don't have to worry. I'mma be there with you. I promise. I don't only need you when I'm broken, Daddy. I am goin' with you. Thank you. Mama, I know you don't agree...

Or with our Regional Council, right here. Your story... speaks to the urgency of Negro rights more than anything this country has ever heard. I've been sharing my story because I want those two men to pay for what they did. And I do too. But I do not believe that justice will be rendered by 12 jurors who look exactly like the two so-called men who are on trial. And our fight, and your story, must continue and will not end with one single verdict. Mrs. Bradley. That's the mother! Come on, get out the way. Mrs. Bradley, why are you here? - Ms. Bradley. - Ms. Bradley! Come on, say something! - Will you testify? - Come on! - You gotta give us something. - Mrs. Bradley. Mamie? It's all right, Daddy.

It was brief. Hopefully, this won't take too long. Get together later. - Mr. Smith. - Yes. Mrs. Bradley. Mamie. - Hmm. - Come on. All rise! The Honorable Judge Curtis Swango presiding. Please be seated. There will be no pictures taken during court proceedings. Bailiff, have the jurors come in and take a seat. Also, get me a Coke sometime. All right? Your Honor, the State has just learned of the existence of another witness to the murder of Emmett Till. The State requests a recess in order to gather the witness. Objection, Your Honor! Your Honor, this will only delay proceedings. Come on. Hmm. Objection overruled. It seems like a reasonable request. Thank you, Your Honor. I'll give you till tomorrow morning to find your witness. The court will have a recess. We will resume at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Court dismissed! Medgar, take me to Money. All right. Okay. That's where it happened? Yes, ma'am. The shop's been closed since the day of the arrest. Most of the patrons were Negroes. Your mama tells me you're all moving up north after the trial. Daddy says it's not gonna be safe. Thank you. We're sorry, ma'am. We're so sorry. You all didn't know this was going to happen. Come here. It's okay. Hmm. Where's your daddy? You gonna sit? I saw your boys. Was probably hard for them to see you. You gonna sit? Did you have a shotgun in your house the night they took Bo? I've been wanting to explain to you what happened. You told me that part. White men came knocking - on my door, Mamie. - I know that part. They had a gun. You have a gun! How long did you stand there doing nothing while they took my child? If I'd have shot them, they would've killed all of mine! It'd be hunting season for every Negro in Money! We have to live here, Mamie. Bobo was with my boys when he went to talk to some White woman. You understand what that mean down here? Don't you dare blame Bo for what happened to him! I don't blame him! I had to make a choice that night. In a moment, I had to choose. And you chose yours over mine. It wasn't just two White men with a gun that night. It was every White man who'd rather see a Negro dead than breathin' the same air as him. Every sheriff, every judge in this town was at my door that night. I was facin' a lot more than two men with a gun. He was my only child. I know. That's why you're moving after the trial... because you're going to testify? No Negro in Money has ever spoken against a White man... and lived. That's the house. If he runs, make sure he doesn't get away. Amzie, right here. Hey! Not so loud. You'll scare him off. We told you to leave Willie alone. Let's have a conversation inside. He didn't see nothin'! Come out or we're comin' in. You gonna get the boy killed. Hey! Hey! Come on, come on! We need to keep him here just in case he runs off again. I ain't gonna run. I'll tell 'em what I saw that night. And what about your grandparents? Would you say that they heard some sounds comin' out the barn too? No, no, I promised them I was gonna keep them out of it. We're gonna finance security for your entire family after they testify, so don't you worry none, son. All right? His name is Willie Reed, a field hand for J.W.'s brother. He's a witness who lives on the farm not too far from where he saw J.W. and Roy Bryant and several other men take Emmett. Now, Willie's family also works for the Milams, so they also heard a lot of noise that night. There were other men? It pains me to have to tell you this, but there were some colored men that were involved. Colored men did this to my boy? Well, they work for Milam and Bryant, and found out Bryant had 'em paid to skip town. What... I can fix that for you. It means a lot, what you're doing. Thank you. Thank you. It's the right thing to do. Go ahead and put these on. It's difficult for me to fall asleep before Medgar gets home. I've wanted to meet you. What you did with those photographs... What you're doin' now, it's, um... It's nothing a mother wouldn't do for her child. Hmm. How old's your son? Two. We almost didn't take him and his sister with us from Jackson, but I... I'm trying to keep the family together as much as possible these days. I'm sure you heard about what happened to our friends Lamar Smith and Reverend Lee. Yes, I have. Medgar and I worked closely with 'em. We did good work. We got a lot of Negroes registered to vote for the first time in Mississippi, and that created the biggest targets on our backs. I, um... I believe in the work we're doin' for our people. I do. But I don't want my children to have to live in fear. I have enough fear for all of us every time I wait for Medgar to get home. Emmett just wanted to go on vacation and have fun with his cousins. He never thought anything would happen to him. He knew how different things were down here, but I never raised him to have any fear growing up. I wanted him to be a boy. And to not have his childhood taken away from him. But it happened anyway. We do the best we can. Do you know Mr. Bryant? He owns the meat market. Hmm. Then you know Mr. Milam, do ya? Not by name. But I know him. How do you know him? He showed up at my door, standing there with a flashlight in one hand and a pistol in the other. And what happened next? He held my family at gunpoint. Then he dragged my nephew from my home and drove off. Sambo! And would you Would you recognize Mr. Milam were you to see him again? Yes, sir. I would. There he is. The State rests. The witness can leave now. The court will have a recess. What did you think you heard? I heard loud hollering and licks comin' from that shed. Sounded like a boy. I saw, uh... J.W. Milam. Saw a green truck with a white top. As they drove off, there was, uh. Two White men in the cab and three colored men in the back. They was all sitting next to a body. Are you sure that's what you heard? Yes, sir. Huh. If that's what you heard, why not yell out, or call "Help"? I... I... I couldn't. No further questions. You can leave now. Did you certify that the body found was Emmett Till? No, I did not. I just said it was a dead body. You couldn't even tell if the body was White or Black. Thank you, Sheriff Strider. You are excused. You want my honest opinion? I think the boy's mammy and the NAACP plotted this whole thing. Thank you, Sheriff Strider. That boy's still alive somewhere. Mamie... Did you have a son who, in his lifetime, was known as Emmett Till? Yes, sir. How old was he? Fourteen years of age. Is his father living today? No, sir. He died in service. Oh. Uh, when your husband, the father of Emmett Till, was killed overseas, were his belongings sent to you? Yes, sir. I now hand you a ring that has engraved on it, May 25th, 1943, with the large initials L.T. Was that among the items that were sent to you? Yes, sir. And is that the ring that Emmett came down here to Mississippi with? Yes, sir. Mamie, I wish you would state to the court, and to the jury, whether you could identify the body that you saw down there in the funeral home as that of your son, Emmett Till. I could. It's hard to describe what a mother knows. Please. The first thing I noticed when I became a mother was that my hands were busy. All the time. Rocking, carrying, swaying, always full. One hand for him, and one hand for what he needed. When it came time to place him down so he could make his own way around, I touched every inch of him. Every bend. My hand knew him with my eyes closed. Just like I'd know his laughter in a crowded room. It's the same thing when you know all of someone. I started by laying my hands on a foot. And then found his knees. I remembered him... as my fingers traced his hairline, and bumped over the crease of his eyelid. He was spoiled and puffed, but these were the same parts of a boy I'd nurtured and loved. Nothing and no one could hide him from me. A mother knows. Your mother would know. And I knew. I knew this was my boy. Emmett Till. Beyond any doubt. Thank you. Uh... Thank you, Mrs. Bradley. I believe that's all any of us would ever need to hear. Mamie? Do you happen to remember the date Emmett Till's father died? Yes, sir. July the 2nd, 1945. Where was he when he died? In Europe. Did you have an insurance policy on Emmett Till? Um... Yes, sir. How much was it for? I had a 10-cent and 15-cent policy, two weekly policies, and they equaled $400. $400? Now, to whom were those policies payable? Uh, we object to that, Your Honor. Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question. I was the beneficiary on one, and my mother was on the other. He ever cause or get in any trouble in Chicago? No more than any other boy. Did he attend a reform school? What for? No. You've been quoted in the colored press, "I told him several times before he left for Mississippi "that he should kneel in the street "and beg for forgiveness "should he ever insult a White person." Not those exact words. Did you caution him not to insult White women? I referred to White people in general. Did you caution your son how to conduct himself and behave himself while he was down here in Mississippi? Several times. Several times! Do tell us how. I will give you a literal description of what I told him. How coming down here, he would have to adapt himself to a different way of life. Be very careful about how he spoke, and to whom he spoke, and to always remember to say, "Yes, sir" and "No, ma'am." I told him that if ever an incident should arise where there would be any trouble of any kind with White people, that if it got to the point where he needed to go down on his knees before them, well, I told him not to hesitate to do so. Like if he bumped into somebody on the street and they might get belligerent or something. Well, I told him to go ahead and humble himself so as not to get into any trouble! But... But what? Well, I raised him with love for 14 years. My sudden warnings about hate weren't going to get through. I now show you what purports to be a photograph of your son. This was taken in my home two days after Christmas. Now, tell the court and the jury what this is. This picture is of my son after Mississippi sent him back to Chicago, dead. No further questions. And for the prosecution? State rests. Court will have a recess. They... They killed my son again. Hmm. Will the jury please retire to the jury room? The testimony being offered here today of a prior incident at the store in Money is irrelevant. Your Honor, may we still continue the testimony on account of the record? Uh, Your Honor... Sit down. Now, I see no harm in letting Ms. Bryant share her side of things if she wants to. Hell, everybody else has. You think you can handle that, dear? Mrs. Bryant, was anyone in the store with you on Wednesday night, 24th day of August, 1955? I was alone. But the children were in the back. In the living quarters. And what time of day was it? After dark. Alone. At nighttime with your children. Well, you just tell the court what happened next. This nigger man came into the store and stood by the candy case. And you? I was behind the counter. I asked the man what he wanted. And then did you get him the merchandise? Yes. And then what did you do? I held out my hand for the money. Will you show the court how you held your hand out? Like this. And did he give you the money? No, he caught my hand. Will you show the court just how he grasped your hand? And was that a strong grip or a light grip that he had when he held your hand? A strong grip. Will you show the court what you did? How did you get loose? I jerked it loose like this. Now, just what did he say when he grabbed your hand? - "How about a date, baby?" - Hmm. Now, you freed yourself. And what happened then? I turned to the back of the store. And he went on his way? No. He came after me. He caught me down by the cash register. Mrs. Bryant, can you demonstrate for the court? Yes. All right, now. Grabbed your hands, pinned them behind your back? Yes. His right hand on your right hip? Here. Just what did he say? He said, "You needn't be afraid of me. "I've been with White women before." And what happened then? Then another nigger came in the door... I'm ready to go. You want me to come and get you when they read a verdict? No. I'm ready to leave Mississippi. Now. What about the verdict? I know what the verdict is. After deliberating for about an hour, the jury has just come back with a verdict of "not guilty." Thus the defendants Milam and Bryant are free men. They celebrated their victory laughing and smiling with their wives at their side, clearly happy... Her story has changed the world. Because she had the courage to make it not just her own, but all of ours. Mamie, it is an honor to share the stage with you. To share this fight with you. Yes, yes! Please welcome Mrs. Mamie Till-Bradley. This is just the beginning. I would like to give honor to God, who is the source of my strength and the reason for my being. I thank you, Mr. Mooty and the NAACP, for inviting me to speak before you all in Harlem, New York City. Yes. My son's brutalized body meant nothing to Mississippi's criminal justice system. And while they blamed the victim, as usual, the federal government stood idly by. If this country fails to protect the Black body from hate, America has yet to meet her promise. Amen! Either freedom for everyone, or freedom fails! One month ago, I had a nice apartment in Chicago. I had a good job. I had a son. When something happened to the Negroes in the South, I said, "Well, that's their business. Not mine." Now I know how wrong I was. The lynching of my son has shown me that what happens to any of us, anywhere in the world, had better be the business of us all. I hear ya, sister! That's right. Tell it like it is! I heard that! Yes! Yes!
