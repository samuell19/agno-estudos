Why don't you take the morning off and I'll take them in on my way in, yeah? Martin? Look, can we not fall out over this, please? Lily will be fine. And Jean... Well, it can't be down to you, the choices other people make, can it? No. No. Right. Kids! Come on! If we don't leave right now, I'm going without you. Come on. DOOR SLAMS HE SIGHS Hello? Yeah. Er, my name? It's Martin Fowler. Cos yesterday is just a dream and tomorrow is but a vision, but today, well lived, makes yesterday a dream of happiness! Miss Slater... I'm talking about your karma, Helen, and every tomorrow, a vision of hope! Very good. Can we talk about your case now? Very wise person, that Kalidasa. Cos I have read his poem so many times in my How to Deal with Anxiety book, and I never really got it. It's amazing what thinking that you are dying and then finding out that you're not actually dying can do to a person! I really would like... If the last few months hadn't been so Godawful terrifying, I might go so far as to recommend the experience. Because there is nothing as fabulous as being alive! Is there, Helen? Today! This very minute! The police are going to charge you with the supply of controlled drugs. Yes. Well... ..there is that. Everything I've seen... You are hardly a criminal mastermind. People often underestimate my intelligence. Miss Slater, you are potentially looking at a long custodial sentence. Yes, well, I know that. DS Foden has already made that perfectly clear. And if there is one thing that I have learned, Helen, it is, you want to triumph over a tribulation, attitude of mind is key. Like I told Foden... ..it wasn't me. So, who was it then? Miss Slater... ..now is not the time for any misplaced loyalty. You want the chance to walk free... ..today... ..tell the Police who put you in touch with the drug dealers. I know it's hard going through a break-up, but you're not on your own now. I am here for you now, that's all I'm saying. I am staying right by my niece's side. Sonia ain't changing her mind, you're right. She told me last night, if you ain't going to leave she's calling a locksmith. Oh! She has always been so unreasonable! And I didn't take her phone! I have no idea how it wound up in my bag! You heroically rescue a small child from a burning building, there are people that you need to call. Apparently you used all her shower gel, and all the hot water, and there's still 50 quid missing from her purse, and to be honest, Janine, I really want my bed back. Oh! Details! And who carries cash anyway? Patronising trumpet player! This can't exactly be a permanent thing, can it? There's no room. I'm broke! My choices are relatively limited. SHE GASPS What happened to family? Hey? What happened to compassion? You think about that, yeah, when you're lying in your cosy little bed at night, and I am out on the streets, hustling just to get myself a cardboard box. Cos I will not stay at that B&B for another night. I will get lice. And Scarlett needs her mother! She needs me with her. Enjoy your day. You lazy little slob. SHE SIGHS I can assure you my payments are completely up-to-date. Yes. So, I think you'll find you need to check your system before you start talking to me about penalties. Sorry, what was your name? Right, do I need to speak to your line manager, Fiona? It's fine. I look forward to hearing. MOBILE PHONE RINGS What? Dad? You finally decided to show your face again, then? Well, you know me. Knock me down, I get back up again. I, uh, had an inside tip on some property coming up for development. Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. All good. My bubble tea investment is paying off, so... Look, it's like what Joanna Lumley once said to me. She said, "Rocky. Some people "just ain't cut out for the affairs of the heart." Wise woman, that Joanna. Do you think it's genetic? That is it! It is me or Dotty, because one of us is leaving. What? Bit drastic. Well, what's she said now? Nothing! She hasn't said a word, and she's out there, right now, Sonia, wearing my brand-new top! I've just seen it on her story. She's nicked it. Look, what is her problem? What is wrong with the girl? Does she want to be me or something? Cos we are not friends! She has literally ruined my life! All right. Oi! Look, Janine can have my bed. She can have whatever she wants, for as long as she wants, cos I swear, I'm telling you now, if you don't kick Dotty out, I'm going to slap her so hard, that she'll be wearing teeth as a flamin' necklace. Whoa! OK. All right, you are not going to do that! Go and get your trainers on. What? You're coming with me. I'm fostering Scarlett. It ain't me. It is down to the court. And I am very grateful. You're a good mum. It can't be easy either. Four kids, by yourself, one in hospital. I've got Jean. Yes. And then there's her! Of course, we're all hoping that the Old Bill don't press charges. Kat, I shouldn't have kicked off. I...um... ..I suppose that I felt helpless. I panicked! She's my only child! And I know that you understand that because I saw your face when I rescued your son from the burning building. How is he, by the way? What do you want? No, no, no, no. No. You have already done enough for me, and I've realised it's not about what I want... ..it's about what I can do for you. Look, be straight with me or do one, will you, Janine? My fish fingers are defrosting. A bed, a room, your Wi-Fi password. That way I can take responsibility for my daughter, and you can concentrate on your poor, wounded little soldier. Cos if you don't put the effort into his recovery now... ..well, little Tommy's football career will be over before it's even begun. BUZZER Just tell me. It's one of the kids, ain't it? Or is it my mum? Is it my mum? Stace... Don't "Stace" me, Martin. You haven't been here once since you stood there and watched me get banged up, and now all of a sudden it's special visiting orders? You sitting there with a face on you like that. Just tell me now or do one! I...um... ..I'm really sorry. I think I've really, really messed up, Stace. Turning with the punches. Twisting up with your core, three, two, one. Now we go skier. Skier? Hopping from side to side. I never knew you were such a gym bunny, Son! Yeah, well. I found an old fitness DVD in the back of the wardrobe, second lockdown. Right, core tight. Keep your focus. You sure this is just the warm up, Son? SONIA GIGGLES It's good for you, Tiff. Gets you out of yourself. Puts things into perspective, don't it? Right, back to the punches. Nice technique! He fancies you. What? Oh, hardly! He said two words! I'm well on the heap. Trust me, Son. If there is one thing I'm all over, it's knowing when a bloke's got his eye on you. I was worried. I was going to call over, but... ..I didn't think you'd want to see anyone, you know? Anniversaries are horrible, ain't they? Brings it all back. I miss Chantelle. But it's a lot for you, even before the fire. My dad's in a hospice. Dying. Obviously. I'm so sorry. Just rang me. First time in...ten years. Didn't even know his number. Finally, he can fit me in. But I said no. I mean, I told him, "Why now?" It's way too little, too late. You want to know why my life is such a car crash? You could do a lot worse than start with my father. ..and five, four, keep going, three... ..keep going, two, and one. Well done. OK, so we're going to partner up. So, the idea is you want someone of similar experience. We don't want any injuries. I'll be your partner. I should leave. Maybe when you give me back that top that you nicked. I didn't nick it, I borrowed it. Tiff, you can be with me. It's fine. I'm looking for someone to pair up with. If you're free? Me? Ain't scared, are you? Yeah, I spent my whole childhood feeling like an inconvenience, a disappointment. Scared. That's just wrong. Your life ain't a car crash, Gray. You're a successful man. Your dad's got to be proud. Yeah. Well, he's not as generous in his judgments. My dad's never liked me. Gray, maybe he's just trying to reach out. No. Gray... Gray... This could be the last time you get to see him. And I can come with you. If you want to see your dad, if you decide that... ..it's worth a try... ..you don't have to do this on your own. Nice! OK, that's it. Time out. Take a quick breather. Er, Nance, have you got any spaces on your advance class? I have. Come in here. See? I knew that you and me could still be mates. Dotty, me and you were never mates. I was just waiting until you weren't expecting it. Time out! You weren't supposed to hurt me! You weren't supposed to steal my husband! DOTTY SCREAMS Get off me! PANTING AND SHOUTING Ow! Ow! DOTTY GASPS DOTTY SQUEALS It weren't me that cheated on you! It was Keegan! It was nice to meet you. I shouldn't have trusted her and it ain't like I don't know her. I know she's got problems. You think? She's my wife and I... You loved her. I wanted to move on... ..but it's me, Stace. All of this is my fault. Don't flatter yourself, Martin. You didn't turn Ruby into a liar. She's good! And... Well, she's a laugh, ain't she? You're not the first person to get taken in, but who Ruby is, that goes way back to before she met either of us. But she set me up. She put me in here. You've had your eyes opened finally, so go and do something about her! And bring Lily in, cos she is a kid, Martin, she needs me. She shouldn't be getting caught up in drugs. I know. Never mind Arthur losing his dad and I... I still cannot get my head around the fact that I will never see Kush again. I miss him. Get that woman out of their lives, before she does any more damage. I want you to take the kids to my mum's. I can't. Jean's in custody. Drugs charges. Ruby set her up. So, let me get this straight... Your defence is that you grew a large quantity of weed by accident? For the tape, Miss Slater nodded her head. You came under pressure to sell this weed, to make a big deal, by someone you've known for many years, who you used to be close to. For the tape, Miss Slater nodded her head. You only did this because you were scared of that person, and now you're scared to reveal their name? For the tape, I am nodding my head, because, I don't mean to be rude, but that person has gone a bit twisted and desperate and, I think, quite bitter. I'm on the horns of a dilemma, Your Honour! Miss Slater, are you willing to make a statement naming that person? Miss Slater... Don't you think you have a moral obligation to ensure that person does not continue unchecked? WHISPERING: Yes. She's ill again? She would have told me. She would have said something. She didn't say anything. So what, she's just been dealing with this all on her own? She must be scared. Martin, my mum can't die while I'm in here! She can't die in prison! I need to go. I've got to go. Stace... I'm so sorry. You're sorry, are ya? Yeah? You're sorry? Sorry's not good enough, Martin. You sort out that lying, vicious, evil little cow, before I... You don't have to tell me. Oh, don't I? DON'T I? So, what are you doing here then? You don't do it, and I swear to God, I will kill Ruby Allen with my bare hands. DOOR OPENS DOOR CLOSES Like I said, one week. Till you get yourself on your feet. One week, two weeks... Me and you will have such a scream. I'll drop my bags round later this afternoon, and maybe we can get a takeaway tonight. Save you cooking. Cash flow. Who's told you that? The fire investigation officer. Something about a cardigan setting alight on the hob. Now I've got to take on extra shifts to pay for mine and Lexi's new wardrobe. Oi! Lola! Mother, I think you need a lay down, don't you? Shut up, Mick. No, I don't. When I left Phil's house, I never saw him putting any clothing into the cooker. So... Think, Mick, think. How long did it take that fire to take hold? They said a couple of seconds? So? So, it can't have been you, then, can it? No. I would have been long gone. So, the person that set fire to Phil Mitchell's house, was the last one to go there. Sorry? What? You did start that fire. No! Of course not! It was probably electrical. Or you know what kids are like with matches these days. Ah! It's worked. Phew! Go on. If Jean comes to the front, all your problems are solved! You know Jean. She doesn't know how not to tell the truth. The Old Bill are coming, Mick. Just a question of when. Do you want a bottle of beer? Yeah. Yes. I can confirm that. For the tape, I am confirming that your full co-operation in this matter, Miss Jean Slater, will be brought to the attention of the court. And if I tell you now, I can walk straight out and go home. Today? Yes. You will... You will go easy on the culprit, because I don't think deep down she's actually a bad person. I cannot pre-empt any trial outcome. I just gather the information. I just need the information. All that's left is for you to finally give us the information, Miss Slater! The person that set up the drugs deal... You see, I mean she's not a mastermind, she's just lost her way a bit. I mean, there was a time when I almost looked on her like family. Her name is... ..Ruby Allen.
