It's true. I would never have believed that my father could die one day. You want me to come with you? It's, how do we say... A matter between me and him. You look tired. No, it's fine, I'm fine. He's so far, I feel like both his daughter, and his country. It'll be okay. I have to go now. Tell me, Do you love me? Guess. Sanguines Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE Please, no porters. Hi, I'm Berryl Salieri. And he's the driver, Alvaro. Ah, Okay. Can I smoke? - You know how to shift gears? - Not your driver's license. You need a license to shift gears? You shouldn't smoke. Excuse me, Miss. That's good! "Alvaro" "Alvaro" - Marine Salieri. Nice to meet you. - Johann. - "Johann", that's all? - Yes. I hope you will like it here. We want the garden to be perfectly maintained. Regarding the beach... The cleanliness of the entrance is also your responsibility. Understood, ma'am. We'll take you for a one month trial, then we'll decide from there. I hope you don't refuse bad swimmers. - Sorry? - It's a joke ma'am. You don't have to make jokes, I have no sense of humor. I'll try not to forget. - This is for you. - Thanks. You will live here. - You have any questions for me? - No ma'am. Take your time to settle in. Oh the Rolls-Royce! - Mr. Pierre Salieri. - Johann, I come from France. - Perfect. Will you open? - Yes. Thanks. I'm gonna take a shower. Are you French? I live in Paris. They were born in Paris. They're very rich. You... You speak French well. Yes I do. One day, I'll go to Paris. Taxi. Taxi. It's good, a Taxi. Being a driver. How do you say "Ocean" in Portuguese? - Sea... Ocean... - And in Portuguese? We speak Parisian French here. The little one, she never pays. - You want some wine? - Sure. - Can I go to bed? - Already? Yes. Can I go? On the condition that you kiss your father affectionately, and that your good night is deeply heartfelt. - Good night, Marine. - Good night. Such energy for someone seemingly tired. She's growing up. What does that mean? Nothing. I just see that she's growing up. What? I have cold feet. What does that mean? Nothing. Berryl! Berryl! Berryl! Johann. Johann! - Yes ma'am? - Go get Berryl, please. - Where is she? - The beach. What do you want me to tell her? Tell me, doesn't it surprise you, a French family settled in Portugal? - And what's the answer supposed to be? - We are luxury immigrants. Cooperates seems more accurate to me. We're hoping to get to Brazil, do you know it? What exactly are you trying to tell me? Nothing. Nothing specific. I'll go get Berryl. You are a painter. Tell her, we're expecting her for lunch. Berryl, your parents are expecting you for lunch. You're not really a gardener. What does this have to do with anything? Why here, at my home? - I don't understand. - You also paint. Yes. Sketches beyond sketches, up to the classic canvas. I don't see your easel. No colors, no brush, no canvas. And as you may have noticed, it's not even Sunday. Funny. You will have to choose, Mr. Salieri. Either you explain. Or you go too far. - What do mean, "go too far"? - Not explaining yourself in time. Rest assured. My job leads me to diplomacy. Do I look worried? The adventures of Berryl. She loves cars. Lives for the love of engines. - Wanna talk about engines, Johann? - Me? I can only see what is alive. - Limiting. - And limited. - What did you come here looking for? - Time. But at home, time passes? What are you talking about? Shouldn't we have a sense of the seasons? What is it you think you will find here? Oh, thanks. Promise me that you will never die. Please, dine with us tonight. Here. - Johann? - I would love some, thank you ma'am. I still have a hard time understanding your approach. There is nothing mysterious about it. But what did you come here looking for, a light? The ocean? New faces? What is the reason for a painter to come? I want to drive nails into wood Cut down trees. - We have no more trees to cut. - Too bad. - You know, I meet a lot of painters. - Interesting. Young Portuguese painting has nothing to envy from anyone. I don't doubt it. My position as cultural delegate could perhaps favor an exhibition. Part of an exchange between galleries, for example, with whom have you worked? I don't have anything yet. That's a shame. It was your name and your expressions that gave it away. You know that saying of Cocteau? "Mirrors should think longer before they reflect" That must be a hard quote to place in a conversation. So little time to understand and forgive. So, was it good? Yes. No. I'll smoke later. The little one says you're an artist. Yes. Artist. - Good night. - Good night. What are you thinking? Kiss me again. You were making love with him, not me. It was with him. In ten minutes at the beach. You want to see less and less of me. Do you regret me? It's being buried that scares me, not dying. I promise you death one day. You shouldn't move, Berryl. I'm cold. I don't see the point of choosing a dress just to go pose naked. I think I'll regret it. You don't have to go. It is after all just a word given, during a social night. That's not a reason. I like your smell. Why did you never draw me? I don't know. Maybe you moved too much. Maybe it would've been enough, if you drew me. Enough for what? For me. What is better, A failed painter, or a successful cultural delegate? A failed painter. Can you draw the speed of the moment? What's better than shadow and light? You will really enjoy it. Maybe. - Alvaro! - Sorry, sir. You're going too fast. - I am thirsty. - What were you doing? Carrying Johannâ€™s mail. Will you show me your drawing? Of course. What would you call that, Art restored to nature? - The uselessness of performance - Don't be modest, Johann! Gauguin said he was a great painter, History proved him right, after killing him. - I've been told. - Do you like us? Our trip was very pleasant. That's all that matters. Fancy. Who searched my room? You have a problem? That your husband wants to achieve a performance for the record books. That you wanted at all costs to make yourself Lady Chatterley. - But that you daughter-in-law... - Please. Please. Berryl! Huh. Transparency, death, a light. I picture your sweat, I confuse it with my tears. Promise me that you'll never die. Thanks for your strength, thanks for you, so little time to understand and forgive. "I picture your sweat..." "I confuse it with my tears..." Is that all? I don't remember the last one. There's never any rhymes? There is! Tell me, why did you do it? It's no big deal. Don't you have any work? How many times a day do you clean it? Isn't she beautiful? You love her, right? I don't know. The little girl doesn't look at me anymore. But she looks at you. Berryl... Berryl Little one, little one! What do you want? Go get the car, Alvaro. We're going out tonight. Of course, sir. Berryl! What? Wanna eat with me? Sure. - Have a seat. - I brought this. Thanks. - They're at a reception. - What? They are at a reception, at the French Embassy. - They never have you here? - They do. But receptions... There are waitresses, hosts... There are extras. I am the head of extras. It's true! I would love to have a reception here. Maybe he can let you use the grill! - You think so? - I don't know. You know, in these receptions, there are women with dresses... Whew! Are you married? No. Me and women... I love a woman. You're a fool. You're a woman's fool. A woman's fool. Guess who? - Good evening Berryl. - Good evening. Have you eaten? Wanna eat with us? Have a seat, Alvaro! Serve yourself! I'm not hungry. Well. Where are you going? Don't pay him attention. He does nothing like everyone else. He's an artist. Sure you're not hungry? - Not even thirsty? - Are you thirsty, yourself? Yes. - Not gonna swim? - It's too cold. Your bathing suit is transparent. Are you gonna keep spinning around like this? Huh? Hop! Don't play too hard, eh? Thanks. Berryl! Does inspiration guide your feet too? Atlas couldn't have held the world the way you do. - Do you like her? - What? My wife. You like her? Is this the consulate speaking? That's not an answer. Are they fighting? - Maybe. - For what? For the control of sea territories. You're blocking the sun. Berryl, your bike. Berryl! Johann, bring back Berryl's bike. Of course, sir. Are you hurt? We're always hurt. He's not a painter. You don't want him. I could just kick you out. You know why I haven't? You are an excellent gardener. As a painter, I don't know about that, but it's not that important, right? Thank you, sir. Starting today, each of us will stay in the place we're meant to stay at. Of course, sir. I feel good here. - I came here to find peace. - You're right, even egomania needs rest. What are you afraid of? You've never exhibited in any of the major Parisian galleries. Not even small ones, the way I checked. - The society of independent artists, perhaps? - Especially not. I wonder what gives you this foolish pride. What if I kill you? - Will you kick me out then? - This question makes no sense. Precisely. Listen, Mr. Salieri. - I don't want this. - Want what? I'm sorry to disappoint you, I am a painter. - Some talent! - This question makes no sense. Prove it to me! No. Good evening. I couldn't sleep and... Who were you waving to? I didn't wave. - You're not in bed either. - I don't feel sleepy. Give me a cigarette, please. Thanks. Why did you ask me for a cigarette? So that you offer me something. Well, there it is. It's done. You know very well that we can't stay like this. Take me in your arms. I don't feel like it. You're lying. Yes and no. Why yes? The call of the human body. Why no? - The soul's answer. - It's time to make a decision. Because of mosquitoes. Dad! No! Pierre! Pierre! I'm going to park the car ma'am. Pierre! - I never see you anymore. - You're seeing me now, aren't you? Berryl! - I need to talk to you. - You don't need to tell me anything. Is this all you have to say? He has a wife. He is in love with her. He's going to leave. You don't love me anymore. What if I find you beautiful? I can, no? I can! You're hurting me. Yes? I want a drawing. Sorry Alvaro, that is not possible. I never give these out. I want a drawing of me. Have a seat. Take a comfortable position. Sit straight. You know, It won't look like you. Like me? Yes. The drawing and you... Won't be the same. But, you don't know how to draw? I do. Move as little as possible. That's very good. I don't understand why you're doing all this. You want someone who fights? It's fighting for you that exhausted me. That's not what I was asking from you. You have to accept it. I am neither a painter nor a musician, nor a writer, none of that. Is that bad? What's bad is that you don't believe in yourself. That's what's bad! Accept me the way I am, or leave! You know what's bad? It's your inability to learn. You want to teach me? I'm afraid I'll never learn. And I'm afraid of not understanding what you want to tell me anymore. Why don't you ever ask me for anything? Why? Because I don't want to be responsible for anything. You're a coward. Come on, be strong. Dry yourself, before you catch a cold. That's it. Talk about love instead of doing it. Are love and happiness the same thing? Or are these questions too difficult for you? Do I have to answer? Please. Please. The only answer I have found, is to live. To not cross the road when I come across something. To love, and to paint. You're afraid? She always says I worry about everything. And within these worries, there are memories of the cavemen. Who is "She"? My difficult other half. Me and him, we don't love each other. You should. Accept the fact that I love you. No. Not like this. I don't think so. You're not free. - I am. - No. You're not free. - Have you beaten her before? - What? Where's the violence of the cave man you were talking about earlier? What do you do in the night? You tell her about prehistory while she moves. She holds your big hairy hand. I want to be beaten, To be pulled by the hair! I want to suffer! I want to risk death! I want to asphyxiate with passion! Do you understand? Do you want us to beat each other? Does this excite you? Not me. Not you? What are you doing to me? Good night, Mrs Salieri. The call of your body. Violence of your desire. Tenderness of your recognition. Softness of your arms. It's about not letting it become a matter of selfishness. What are you talking about? Ask Alvaro, If you can't fix it. There won't be any need for that. Dare to say that I don't please you. - You are beautiful. - Thanks. - It's not me. - Yes it is. - How is it me? - It's your inner-self. It's not good to poke fun. I'm not, Alvaro. You see, he could've drawn you like a photograph and let it be. But he chose to draw you the way your heart is. Is it expensive? Does it have any value? I don't know, yes. So it's me! Yes. Berryl! Look, he painted me! I'm like all of you. I am like you! Why are you doing this? You have no right! I have a soul! Berryl. - I have to go back home. - No, stay. I'll catch you! I'll catch you! - You cheated. - No. I didn't cheat. You're hurting me. - What do you want? - Nothing. I don't want anything. Little girl... Little girl. No! Berryl! No! What's going on! What's wrong? Calm down! I'll go look for him. I'll talk to him. I want him to leave. Of course he'll leave. - I'll go find Marine. - No! Will you go see if he isn't hurt badly? Yes. You won't say anything? Alvaro? Alvaro! Alvaro. Come on. Stand up. Little girl? - What are you doing here? - Where's Alvaro? - He's gone. - Have you spoken to him? - Yes. - Why did he do that? I'm scared! I'm so scared he'll come back! - You shouldn't be. - Why? Berryl. Was he trying to rape me? I don't know. Yes. Maybe. I love you. I... Berryl, you need to go to bed. - And you? - Me too. Be careful. - I want to stay with you. - No. - I am scared. - Come on. I have a present for you. Again? Prove to me that you're a painter. Oh really? - I can pay you if you want. - You've already paid me. Do it! I am sorry. I'm really sorry. Come with me to the beach. I'm tired, Marine. I'm so tired. I am an orphan. Draw me a sun. I love you. Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE@KG
