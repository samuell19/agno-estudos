Then I will file continuation motions until that judge wishes that she'd never heard of McHale Tech. Do you get me? Goodnight. Hello? Huh. I must've left it open. I wasn't sure if you were going to show up. I guess people in a jam have a way of doing that. I was really looking forward to that egg roll. What's that for? So, let's start with trust. All right. Trust. People in crime fiction, they don't trust each other. But by contrast, the mystery writer creates a bond with the reader. So there's a tension between story and storyteller. What? What? Your look. What look? You think I'm gonna lose them. No, I think you're doing great. But you're frowning. I'm not frowning, I was thinking. So your mind is wandering? No. But I was thinking about what you were saying, and just... I don't know, how it wasn't at all what I would've said. Oh boy. No, no. It's a good thing. I think that they can benefit from hearing a different perspective. Yeah? Yeah, absolutely. You're doing great. Please, continue. Okay. Now, Interestingly, the earliest definition for the word trust, was alliance. So this one has 16 million views, and it's a woman talking about bees. Yeah, I know. I've seen this one before. It's actually fascinating. My point is, you doing a Teachable Talk is a huge deal. There're also talks with 16 views. That will not be you. I mean, come on. Who wouldn't love you? Morning. For instance... For instance what? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing, nothing? All right, now this I gotta investigate. We were just talking about Amy doing T Squared in Seattle. T Squared? Yeah. Uh, Teachable Talks. It's where speakers talk about big ideas, or new ways to look at things. I am speaking on why people are so obsessed with mysteries. I was just saying that a lot of people would be really interested in hearing about that. For instance, you. Gotcha. You know, your dad actually mentioned this to me. But I thought it was Friday. It is. But Bishop wants me there early to rehearse. Bishop? Uh, Tim Bishop. He's the founder of Teachable Talks. He's a little more than that. Uh, usual, Travis? Yes. Thank you, Holly. Huh. Uh, so... When do you take off? Now, actually. Bags are in the trunk. Your dad's not going to go? Yeah, he's coming. Just somebody's working on his house today, so he's gonna drive over tomorrow. I never heard how you got invited to this thing. Tim. Bishop. Yeah. Tim Bishop. Yeah, he's an old friend of mine. Uh, anyway. You know what? I should get going. I don't want to get stuck in traffic. All right. Well, uh, travel safe. Yeah, you too. You're... you're not going anywhere. Just have a good day. All right, um... -Bye.-Bye. Bye, Holly. Kill 'em, Amy. Hey, tell Tim I say hi. Yeah. Hey, Holly. Your phone. Hey, let me ask you a question. Uh, so... you know this Tim Bishop guy too? Um, yes? And what's his story? Oh, he's a professor, psychologist, wrote a bunch of books. Sort of a genius. He's a genius, yeah? Yeah. But I mean so is Amy. Right. Yeah, yeah. And how do you, uh, how do you know this genius? Well, through Amy. Through Amy? Okay. Fine. He's her ex-boyfriend. Oh. Yeah. They were perfect for each other. Really? Totally. But obviously things didn't work out. Although I do think he's still single. And he's British too, so I mean, that accent. Hmm. Thank you, Holly. â™ª When I came up with the concept of Teachable Talks, I had no idea what it would turn into, or what it would takeout of me. To quote a great writer,"There's no trap so deadly "as the trap you set for yourself." Raymond Chandler. Right. You know it. Ahh. You gave me my first Chandler. "The Long Goodbye". I remember. Mmhmm. Took me weeks to realize you were trying to tell me we were over. Oh, well. I don't think I even knew that myself at the time. Well, remind me again. Why did we break up? Ah, well. I think it was your extreme fear of commitment. Let's not forget your extreme commitment to your work. Okay, all right, fair enough. So, tell me. Is there anyone special for you right now? Oh, well... you know. I mean, sort of. Uh, nothing err, you know. But, I mean, it's... You have not change done bit. Well, what about you? Oh, uh, well, I'm, uh, the Chair of the department now. So there's that. So you haven't changed either. It's good to see you, Bishop. It's been way too long, Winslow. No one has called me that since... Well, since you. Well, well. What? People toasting. Yeah. What do they look like to you? Well, from reading their body language, I would say they were a couple. Hmm-mm. I would definitely say that this is not their first date. Yeah. And from reading you, I'd say you know them. That's Alexis McHale. Head of PR for McHale Tech, and their COO Billy Poole. McHale Tech, as in who's sponsoring this round of Teachable Talks? Right. You'll meet Mitchell McHale. Tech wizard. Created this money lending app that made him a bazillion dollars. I think he spent a zillion of it on his electric car. I joined their advisory board last month. He's, uh, underwriting this round so he can do his own tour, promoting this new software called "Slooth". As in, detective? Mmm. A virtual one. It's an acronym, it stands for something complicated, like Sequential Logarithmic something something. Anyway, Mitchell's shopping into police departments. A computer that solves crime? I don't know, I'm not sure you can reduce deduction down to a bunch of zeroes and ones. Like, for instance, I don't think that a computer would be able to infer, from what you've shared, that Alexis isn't McHale's sister, she's his wife, right? And Billy Poole's not just his COO. Who is he? He's his best friend. Ooh, ouch. Are you cold? No, no. I'm fine. Thank you for dinner, though. My pleasure. Well... Hey, can I interest you in a slice of the best pie in Seattle? Uh... You know, I really should review my talk. I did mention it's the best pie in Seattle, right? Yeah. Oh. Goodnight, Bishop. See you tomorrow, Winslow. Yeah. Bye. So, why do we call misdirections "red herrings?" Well, the first instance of the term dates all the way back to... 15... something. 15... Ugh. 1567, when Elizabethan writer Thomas Nash published a... Lenten Stuffe, or the Praise of the Red Herring. Now in that book... This is awful. Mmm. Who's distracted now, huh? Oh. Hey, honey. Hey Dad. How's Seattle? Good. Yeah, Seattle is good. How's Garrison? It's... It's... It's fine. Great. Honey, is there, uh, is there something you want to talk to me about? No. No, no. I'm just here, uh, rehearsing for my talk, and uh... I did go out to dinner tonight. With Tim Bishop. Dinner as, uh, with all the, uh, all the speakers? Nope, no, it was just, uh, just me and him. Uh-huh. How'd that go? It was nice, surprisingly enough. Oh. Good. That's, that's good. You know what Dad, um, I'm just going to get back to it, uh, and I will, uh, see you tomorrow? Yeah, you will. Okay. All right, bye. Bye. You off to Seattle? Not without my Joe to go. Did you hear from Amy? Yeah. She had dinner last night with Tim Bishop. As in, just the two of them dinner? Um. Hmm. Well, that's very interesting. -Yeah.-What is? Hey. Hi. Hey, I thought you were headed to Seattle. Yeah, this is my last stop. I was up late last night and I needed a little energy assistance. So what's "very interesting?" Mm. Nothing. Yeah, nothing really. No. Guys? Am I going to have to take you down to the interrogation room? Um. Okay, okay, look. Um, Amy called last night, and, uh, uh, she had dinner with this, um, this fella. Tim Bishop. Yeah. I heard about this genius yesterday. Genius. Amy said that? No, no. Somebody else. Thanks, Holly. Sure. Take care, guys. I think genius is a reach. So you're not a fan? No. No. No, I mean, look, let me just say that I wasn't exactly heartbroken when he and Amy split up, but... he's a very self-involved guy. He's... he's charming though, he's charming. Yeah. But I mean, you know she's... she's grown up, and I should stop worrying, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, uh, okay then. Yeah. I'll see you when you get back. Okay. All right. All right. I... I can drive. What? Yeah. You can drive to Seattle? I mean, you just said yourself, you barely slept. It's not safe. I don't have any active cases right now, I can... I could drive. Huh. Nah. Yeah, you're right. It's a crazy idea. All right. I'll see you when you get back then. No, no, no. Hang on, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'd love for you to come. You know? Yeah, you could, uh, you could stay and see Amy's talk. Yeah? I mean if you... if you've got a couple of days. Do I? Hey, I've got vacation time. If I don't use it, I lose it. Great. Great. Got one question for you, though. What's that? You, uh, you got a tux? Heh. And once upon a time, a red herring was just a fish. It was the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle... Clicker! What? Should be on the next slide. Oh. Sorry. I'm used to a chalkboard. I remember. Tim Bishop. Mitchell McHale. I've got the film. The film? On S.L.O.O.T.H. And I'll want to see it projected, cool? Um... Uh, Mitchell, this is Professor Amy Winslow. She's one of our speakers. Yeah, hi. Nice fish. So hey, can I get this thing projected so we can check video and audio quality? Uh, I'm sorry. I'm just rehearsing. I'm kind of rehearsing here. This will only take three minutes, and believe me, it'll be worth it. I'm Billy Poole, I'm the COO of McHale. Hi, Amy Winslow. Alexis McHale. I run our marketing department. She's also my wife, and he's also my best friend, in case you're wondering how they got their jobs. Okay, let's roll this thing. I'm so sorry. And can we kill the lights? Crime. It's everywhere. And no matter how much we fight it, it seems like it will never go away. What if we could harness the power of computers to help solve crimes faster? What if we could use technology to help eliminate crime altogether? What if we could make our cities and towns safe once again? McHale Tech is proud to announce a software-based solution to one of society's oldest problems. A revolution in fighting crime. Introducing S.L.O.O.T.H from McHale Tech. Sequential Logarithmic Objective Output and Telemetry Housing. It's a fancy name that means one simple thing. Crime stopper. Killer. I'm going to want a pin spot on me. Right here. And fog would be nice. Can we do fog? We can do fog. Perfect. So, thoughts on the film? Fantastic. Incredible. Yeah, powerful. What about you, professor? Honestly, frightening. Boom. There we go. Love it. Billy. Grab the drive back from the tech guy. I don't want him stealing it. Tim. Side bar. Um. Uh... Amy, take five? Sure. Wow. Easy, honey. Easy. Billy, he knows. What if he does, soon enough it won't matter. Bishop, don't do that! Sorry. Where'd they go? Who? Billy and Alexis. They were just right here, practically lip-locked. You remember that dinner we spied on last night? Mmhmm. Well, I can tell you they are definitely not just a couple of coworkers. Come on. Oh. Well, they're gone. Again, sorry, I startled you. You didn't startle me. Uh, you got a little bit scared, just a little. No. -Tim. -Vicky, hey. This is Amy Winslow. Uh, Vicky Lin. Hi. I recognize you from the brochure. I'm coming to your talk. I'm a bit of a crime fiction nut. I've read every Atticus Keller book, a couple of times. Well, I'll have to tell my father. Are you doing a talk as well? Oh, no, no. I couldn't handle the pressure. Vicky handles pressure daily. She runs the biggest venture capital firm in town. Wow. You just missed Mitchell. Oh. You know Mitchell McHale? I've certainly... experienced him. Oh. Well, that's a good word for it. Vicky's interested in S.L.O.O.T.H as an investment. Possibly. Do you know about this S.L.O.O.T.H? I saw the promotional film for it, yeah. And? I mean, I have to be honest, I'm no computer expert. But I do know that being a detective is all about interpreting complex human behaviours. I don't know, I just feel like the smartest machine will never be human. Well-reasoned. I'm looking even more forward to your talk. Take care. Nice to meet you. You too. Well. Should we get back to rehearsing? Yes, we should. Do you have a time machine? Because you look like you did when I first met you. I don't know about that. I don't think I was wearing this to early 20th century American lit class, was I? Shall we? Yeah. Sure. -Dad?-Hey Travis! What are you doing here? Uh... Surprise. Uh, your dad... I was... I was up late last night writing, and, uh, he offered to be my chauffeur. Yeah. Oh. Hi, Graham. Tim. Tim Bishop. Tim founded Teachable Talks. Oh, hey. Travis Burke, uh, I'm Graham's chauffeur. Well, he's also a detective at the Garrison Police Department. Cool. Mitchell McHale will want to talk to you about his crime solving software that he says will put you out of a job. Is that so? Am I... do I... do I... am I supposed to know who Mitchell McHale is? No. Let me put you on the guest-list for the party. I'll get us checked in. Yeah, all right. Uh... You look beautiful. Thank you. This is a big surprise. Yeah, for me too. Ugh. I guess you can tell that my dad's not really fond of Tim. Yeah. I can't imagine why. Okay. All set. Speak of the devil, that's Mitchell now. Mitchell, where's Alexis? No idea. Hey. Mitchell McHale. Ah, so you're the guy who's going to put me out of a job, huh? Uh, Trevor's a policeman. Travis. Travis Burke. Right. Sorry. I should be closing a deal tonight with Seattle Metro PD to license the S.L.O.O.T.H software. Coming to my party? Yeah, yeah, sure. I wouldn't miss that. We should, uh... Yeah, yeah. See you at the party. Bye, Amy. -Bye.-Yeah, good to meet you, too. So... Read on Tim? I don't like him. Well, that's comforting. Hey, uh... Graham? Yeah? They're not wearing tuxes. Too bad for them. â™ª Here you go, Winslow. Thank you. Look at that. You think Mitchell knows about Billy and Alexis? Mmhmm. Think Vicky told them? No, I think he already knew. Please... I think the Vicky thing is totally different. Having fun, Mitchell? I look like I'm having fun? I need some air. I'll walk you. I want to bend your ear about something. See you in a bit. Yeah. Let's get out of here. So, my father, Graham Winslow, he actually created the class, uh, but now I teach, um, mys... Uh, would you excuse me just for one second? Thank you. Ah, there she is. Dapper! You look lovely too. You look great. Thanks. Well, this is quite an event that Tim's put together. Yeah. Yeah, he has. My ears are burning. Just saying how impressive this all is. Thanks, Graham. Though not as impressive as your attire, I must say. Tim Bishop? That's me. Hi. Rachel. Knox! Wha? Burke? What? What are you doing here? All right, uh, Amy Winslow, this is her dad, Graham. Amy's giving a talk... Rachel Knox. Rachel and I were in the academy together in Chicago. We were both rookies until she became a detective a whole year before me. What are you doing here? Um... Unfortunately, business. I need to speak to you and anyone here connected to Mitchell McHale. Is everything all right? Mitchell McHale is dead. â™ª Alexis, I... I know you're in a bit of shock right now, but I need you to try and remember when you last saw him. Woah. Woah, okay, woah, okay! A little help here! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Here, take her over there... Knox. Hey. Hey. So, did he jump? Or was he pushed? Not sure yet. Any witnesses? We're canvassing, but it's not residential, so I'm less than optimistic. Oh. Who... Prep cook taking out the trash found him. Anyway, I better... get back to it. Alright. See ya. Huh, that's weird. I mean, I just met McHale today, but... He didn't strike meas the suicidal type. Based on first impressions, I agree. And then his wife fainting? Yeah, that's pretty typical. Or it's a good way to avoid talking to a detective. I think that she's having an affair with the guy in the burgundy suit. And he is? That's Billy Poole, COO of McHale Tech, and Mitchell's so-called best friend. How do you know they're having an affair? Body language. And I also overheard them talking about how "he" knew something, and I think the "he" is McHale, and the something is the affair. Well, I think we need to tell that to Knox. Who else knows about this? Other than Tim Bishop, uh, just Travis and my dad. Yeah. Did Tim not tell you about it? Miss Winslow, I... Oh, you can call me Amy. Amy. As much as I appreciate what you've shared with me, I... I do hope that you can appreciate this is a police investigation? Oh, yeah. Completely. Yeah. I just... Rachel, Amy's a professor. She's been a consultant for the Garrison PD in the past. Oh, like Sherlock? Yes. Exactly. Well, we don't do that here. Take care. Good to see you, Burke. Yeah, yeah, you too, Knox. Well, I guess we're not in Garrison anymore, Dorothy. What? You know, it's pretty obvious to me that Rachel trusts you. Maybe you should tell her she should trust me. Thank you. -Hi.-Hi. How you doing? Well, I think I might've slept for 90 minutes. Oh. I don't mean to sound callous, but desperately trying to convince speakers not to bail, and dealing with people cancelling tickets. Yeah. Ugh. Bishop, I am so sorry. Well. I mean, at least I'm alive. Yeah. This is so insane. Did you get any information from the police? No. I mean, they just asked questions. I did all the talking. Did you tell them about Billy and Alexis? I didn't want to gossip. Bishop, a man is dead. Social propriety goes out the window at this point. Of course, no, you're right. Yeah. Hey. Amy. Trevor. Yeah, it's Travis. I'm sorry. Don't know why I do that. I have a few theories. Sorry, I have to take this. One of our speakers. Yeah. Bye. Hey. I want to talk to you about last night and Rachel. Oh, no, no, no. I want to apologize. I shouldn't have snapped at you. Well, apology accepted. I just want you to know that Rachel, she's a good cop. Okay. Well, because you're a good cop, and you haven't minded me being helpful. Fair point. Mmm. Yeah. Um, by the way. Did you and Rachel, uh... Were you... Uh... Were we? Do you want to finish your sentence? No, it's just that... It felt like there was history with you two. Like more than just being cop buddies. Well yeah, I mean, Amy we were partners. At work? Yeah. Oh. And no. And yeah. I mean, listen. Rachel and I might've had a chance to be more, you know, but the timing never worked out, so... I get it, yeah. Do you want to take a walk with me? You seem to have somewhere in mind. I definitely do. The roof. So, there's no security cameras in the stairwell. Mm. So even if McHale got off where we did, another person could've come from the bottom floor and walked all the way up unseen? Yeah. Police tape. You are a policeman. In a different jurisdiction. Uh, does it say Seattle Metro PD line here? Huh. No? Professor Winslow, that is a good point. Right. Go ahead. What do you see? That's a fall, huh? Yeah. That's a long way down. So he was about your height, so just a push... Yeah. A hard push could knock somebody right over. Yeah. Or, he jumped. Yeah, I don't know. A millionaire who paid for this round of talks just to launch his new software? -Hmm.-Seems unlikely. Yeah. Hey look. So you remember Rachel said that the prep cook was taking out the trash when he found the body? Mmhmm. Well look at the way he's going. I mean, how would he have seen the body from that angle? That's a good question. Do you think that's the same guy? Let's find out. Is that our guy? Yeah, I think so. Hi. Uh... I'm Amy Winslow, and this is Detective Travis Burke. Hi. Guillermo Marquez. Hi, Guillermo. Uh, hi. Do you know what happened here last night? Are you the one that found the body? Yeah. Are you a cop too? Uh, well, I'm a consultant. Right. Yeah. But he's a detective. He has a badge, see? -Yeah. See?-Right there. I talked to the cops last night. We're just following up to clarify how it is that you noticed the body on the far side of the dumpster? The phone. What phone? I heard a cell phone ringing, went to it. Was his phone on his person? Twenty feet away, maybe. But then, then I saw him. Right, yeah. Must've been hard for you. Did you happen to notice a readout on the screen of the phone? A name? Sorry. Do you know what time it was? Around 8:15, I think. What did you do next? I freaked out. I came in, went to my boss. He locked the kitchen down, called 911. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Guillermo. Thanks. Okay. So you arrived with my dad at 7:45. Mmhmm. That's when I met your pal, Bishop. You also met McHale. And then we left for the party at 7:50. That sounds right. All right, now I hadn't been at the party very long when I saw Vicky and McHale have this heated conversation. And then he goes over to Billy and Alexis, and says something. And then he walks our way. Our way? No. Me and Tim. Oh. And did he say anything to you? Uh, no. Just that he wanted to get some air. Maybe to the roof. Maybe. Tim went with him. What?! Amy. What? And you're just now telling me this? There's nothing to tell. I mean, it's... Bishop, right. And when did Bishop return to the party? Well, I mean, I didn't see him until after you and my dad arrived. I'm sure that he was... You know. What are you doing? I went up to my room. I took a quick shower. I changed. I got on the phone at 8:14, I talked to Claire, I checked in with her at exactly five minutes, your dad knocks on my door, we come back downstairs, so we're back at the party at what? 8:25. All right. Did you happen to see Vicky, Alexis, or Billy after McHale left? No. But I was definitely looking. Okay. While you were looking for them, did you happen to see your friend, Tim Bishop? Hey, guys. Hey. What's up? We're just talking about how her friend, Tim Bishop, could be a murder suspect. Well, it strikes me that all four people, Vicky, Tim, Alexis, Billy, all four of 'em should be talked to. But isn't that what your detective friend was doing last night? Absolutely. Mmhmm. What? So... Do you not trust her? Well, that's a good question. I mean, should we trust her? I trust her more than I trust your friend, Bishop. Ah, come on. Are you serious? I mean, what motive would Tim have to kill a guy who's backing his event? That is a great question that we should talk to him about. Well, why don't we get Rachel involved, since we all trust her so much? Why are you afraid of me talking to your friend and asking him some questions? I'm not afraid of you talking to my friend. -You're not afraid?-No. Good, great, call him up. Let's ask him right now. Fine. Fine. Mmhmm. Fine. I just want you to know that he's probably not going to answer, because, you know, he's busy doing damage control and all that... Hello? Hey. Amy. Yeah. I just need to talk to you. Sure. Sure. I'll be right up. Okay, thanks. Bye. Not too busy for Amy. Shall we? I would love to. Get this over with. Excuse me. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, oh... Hey, Amy. Hey. Hey, it's me. Trevor. Hi, Travis. There it is. Tim, Travis and I were just talking about last night, and... You left the party last night with McHale. Where did you go? Hang on. Excuse me. Would you mind just giving us a moment? Thank you. Sorry folks. Thank you so much. Um... Amy? You think I had something to do with Mitchell's... with what happened? No, Tim, listen. We're just trying to get... the complete picture, you know. Of the whole night. Everything that happened. That's all. Okay, sure. Of course. Well, as I told your friend, the Seattle detective. I walked Mitchell to the elevator, he asked me not to take it with him. All right. And then what happened next? I turned around and Vicky was walking toward the elevators. Vicky Lin? Mm. She was clearly upset, but she didn't want to talk. I got on the elevator with her anyway. I pressed. She told me she'd gotten her hands on the beta version of S.L.O.O.T.H. Had her R&D people work it over. And? She told me it was... A hoax. Couldn't do what Mitchell said it did. Solve crimes. So is this the last time that she and Mitchell spoke before he left? So she said. How long did you talk to her? We got off on her floor, I walked her to her room, so however long that took. And then what happened next? I'm on the board of McHale Tech. I wanted to talk to Mitchell about this very concerning news. I called him. From Vicky's phone? No. The hallway. He didn't answer. I went to the suite down the hall that we have for McHale Tech, I thought that's where he might be. He wasn't. I waited a while for him to show up, then I went back to the party. Hmm. End of story. Now, I have to get back to work. Thanks Tim. Um, Tim, listen. I... Excuse me. I feel horrible. Oh, come on, Amy. You know how it goes. We asked questions, he answered 'em. Plus, he still doesn't have a good alibi. But. We did learn that McHale was in a lot more trouble than you projected. Yeah. Right. And if news were to get out that his software was a sham? Maybe he wasn't pushed. Right. Right. And we have a new question. Who leaked that software to Vicky? Okay. So who did McHale talk to after Vicky? Billy and Alexis. Billy and Alexis. I'm going to see if Claire can get their addresses. Tim said Mitchell had a pricey new electric car... Huh, look what's parked out front. Well, that's interesting. Either Billy borrowed McHale's car or Alexis is here. Hey, Billy. Sorry for your loss. Um, thanks. Um, I'm in the middle of some... Just wanted to chat with you for a minute. Um... With... with you and, uh, Alexis? Yeah, we just want to clear up a few things about the S.L.O.O.T.H software, then you two can... move on. It's okay, Billy. Thank you. So, it's come to our attention that the software that was supposed to put me out of business might actually put McHale Tech out of business, because it's a sham. Who told you that? Is it the truth? S.L.O.O.T.H is being beta-tested. As with any new application, there are bugs to be worked out. Yeah, see? That's not what Vicky Lin says. See, she confronted Mitchell last night. And then Mitchell confronted the two of you. No. Don't deny it, I saw it. He thought that you two leaked the software. This is ridiculous. Why would we leak software? That would hurt McHale Tech. It's our company too. How much do you care about your company then? I mean, because I saw the two of you out to dinner the other night, and then there was backstage. You're in love, and Mitchell knew. I... We, we should... Billy. Why don't you answer her question? Where did you go after Mitchell confronted you? I told the police last night. Tell me. Excuse me. Hi, Billy. Hey. Your colleagues are here. Burke? I'm calling my lawyer. Detective. A word. Bring your "partner." Me? So, I'm bringing this guy in for questioning, and now he's a hostile witness? What did you say to him that he's lawyering up... Knox. No. Don't "Knox" me. What did you say? Detective, this was my idea. It's Lieutenant. And, is that supposed to make me feel better? Look, I am running a murder investigation here. And yes, that is what we are calling it. No note, no motive for suicide. Well, except that... Except what? Well, except that McHale's software isn't exactly what he said it was. So that could be a huge blow to his... Do you mean the software that my police department is considering licensing? Or maybe you didn't know that. No, we knew that. Just like you didn't know that the phone was missing from the scene? The phone that Guillermo heard ringing? You spoke to the witness, too? Okay. Listen up, Sherlock. You too, Doctor Watson. You have no jurisdiction here, and you need to leave it to the people that do. Hey, Rachel. No, we are done. You know what, I just have to say this. I am sorry that I pushed you. Amy, I knew what I was doing, and I did it. You know how in the past, when I told you to mind your own business, let me do my job? Mmhmm. Well, now I know why you didn't like it. I'm sorry. Thank you. So, what now? Well, now we do what we should've done after we talked to Tim. We go and we talk to Vicky Lin, we confirm his story with her. Mmhmm. That is, if she'll talk to us. I think I have a way to make that happen. Hmm. Ms. Winslow is hereto see you. Ah. Hi Vicky. Thank you for seeing us on such short notice. Hi. This is Detective Travis Burke. Hi. Hello. And this is my dad. Graham Winslow. Vicky Lin. Nice to meet you. Please have a seat. -Thanks.-Thank you. Vicky, I hear that you're fond of Atticus Keller, so a... a first edition. Happy to sign it. Seriously? Yeah. -You got a pen?-Oh, here. Great. So, what is the quid that goes along with this pro quo? Well, honestly, we were just hoping we could ask you some questions about last night. Huh. So awful. Yeah. Before McHale left the party, you two had an exchange that looked a bit heated. What was that about? I told him I was backing away from S.L.O.O.T.H. Because? It's... well, according to my R&D team, it's trash. And what did you do after this exchange? I had a room booked at the hotel., and I went thereto make some calls. Do you think it's possible that Mitchell McHale killed himself because of the software situation? You obviously didn't know Mitch McHale. He told me he was getting a new lawyer, and that he'd have that lawyer sue me for theft of software. Hmm. What happened to the old lawyer? No idea. Can you think of anybody else who'd want to kill Mitch McHale? Mitch McHale was a cockroach. Who doesn't want to step on one of those? That's a great line. Do you mind if I, uh, you mind if I use that? I'd be honoured. Hmm, well, thanks for doing that, Dad. Oh, honey, thanks for including me. I'm not sure how helpful that was. No, no. Sometimes it's good to just confirm existing information. Right. Though I do think you did learn something new. Yeah, that McHale was getting a new lawyer. Exactly. And for someone who thinks all day about word choice, that struck me as odd. I mean, why even bring that up to Vicky? Yeah, that's a good question. You know, there are two people that we could get an answer to that from. Rachel and Tim? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm, yeah. I don't think they really want to talk to us. Well, we lead with an apology. Might I suggest if you want to get the most out of them, you go to Rachel, you go to Tim. Good idea. Yeah. You're on a roll, Graham. Yeah, thanks, thanks. Good luck, guys. Hey, where you goin'? I'm going back to the hotel to hear a Teachable Talk called "What makes a psychopath." It's, uh, research for my next book. Okay, all right, bye. Bye. Alright, good luck. Yeah. Hey Amy. Uh... can you drop me, it's kinda far? Oh, yes, of course. -Yeah, I drove.-You drove. Come on. Mea culpa. I wanted to apologize. You're forgiven. No worries. Please. I mean, it's just weird, being this close to a crime with you, and not being included. I didn't tell you this, but I've been helping Travis and the Garrison PD on a few cases. Believe it or not, Amy has helped me out with a few cases. Wow. Really? What kind of cases? Murders. Homicides. Oh. That's something. So, when this suspicious death happened... She just wants to help. Which she did, by coming to me. Billy Poole is now suspect number one. To be honest with you, Travis has had to protect me in a couple of bad situations. So... I'm sure that impulse of his just kicked in. Sure. I get it. And I think that she was pushing with you, because that's what she's used to doing with me. And that doesn't bother you? Oh, it does. Believe me. You guys definitely seem to have a... strong connection. That's not always the case. I mean, I swear I spend 90 percent of my time just trying to get him to listen to me. For instance, he didn't believe you about Vicky, so he insisted we go talk to her. She can be relentless. For example, she wanted us to talk to Vicky Lin about the S.L.O.O.T.H software. Seriously? You're kidding. No, I'm not. Seriously. Well, I'm sure Vicky confirmed what I said. She did. And the reason I wanted to talk to you is because Vicky did say that McHale threatened to sue her. But he told her he had a new lawyer. And I asked her what happened to the old lawyer. And... she didn't know. Well, his old lawyer is Ray Sweeney. Ray Sweeney is known for defending very rich dirtbags. Do you know this Ray Sweeney? Not well, but... Yeah, I knew him. Knew as in past-tense? Ray Sweeney's home was broken into a few days ago. And I guess he was home at the time. The thief shot him. Ray Sweeney is dead. â™ª Oh. Remember what Miss Marple said? No, I haven't read Agatha Christie yet. Remind me. Well, she said "any coincidence is worth noticing, "because you can throw it away later if it's only a coincidence." Yeah, well, it's a pretty big coincidence. Sweeney and McHale being murdered within days of each other? So much so that I asked Rachel if we could see the Sweeney crime scene tomorrow. We? As in you and also me? Yeah. I laid it on pretty thick, how you've been helpful at Garrison PD. What are you talking about? I have been helpful to the Garrison PD. I know. So you weren't laying it on thick. Amy, that's not the point. The point is, Rachel trusted me, and tomorrow the detective who's working the case is going to show us the crime scene, and he's going to give us access to the reports. Hmm. Well. Good job. Thanks. Thank you. Yeah. Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. What else did she say? Just that Billy Poole is suspect number one, and she extends her gratitude to you for tipping her off about the affair. Good. How about Tim? Did he forgive you for my trespasses? Yes. And I'm assuming that Rachel is not holding you accountable for me anymore? Un-huh. The lesson there, it helps to have somebody else to blame. I guess we're each other's fall guys. Hey, did you press Tim on his shaky alibi for last night? I could not find a delicate way in, so... -I guess he's still up on the board. -He's on the board. Yeah. Rumour has it... There is a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant just right up the block. Would you... would you like to go to dinner with me? I have to rehearse my talk. I was just going to order some room service. Of course. Goodnight, Professor Winslow. Goodnight, Detective Burke. See you tomorrow. Hey, uh. You know what, Travis? I mean, I... I could go. No, 'cause I don't want to be responsible if you, uh, mess up your talk. Okay. Goodnight, Amy. Goodnight. See you tomorrow. Bye. Well, I mean she definitely said 9:30. Yeah. Aw. Hmm? Who's that? That's her dad. That's Rudy. Now Rudy made the best paczki in Chicago. What's paczki? Ho, ho, ho. What's paczki? Amy Winslow, it's a Polish doughnut. Ohh. So money was always an issue, and then finally he was able to open his own shop. And then he lost it. And then she lost him. Sadly, he passed away. Oh. When did he pass? I heard about six months ago. -Hey.-Hey. Sorry we're late. I got caught up in a morning briefing. No worries. Hi. Detective Denny Roma, this is Detective Travis Burke, and this is, uh... Non-detective Amy Winslow. Yeah. Denny's going to show you the Sweeney scene. It's his case. Which is getting colder by the day, which the Lieutenant knows is something I can live with. Why? Ray Sweeney was a defence attorney. He got a lot of bad guys off and made some cops on the witness stand look lousy in the process. The Lucky Irishman is what he's known as in the DA's office. Yeah. So Denny, you good to run with them? You know it, Lieutenant. Hey, and if you do find a connection to the McHale case... We'll bring it to you. Bye. Thanks, Rachel. -Hey.-Hey. -Thanks.-You're welcome So, you, uh, you knew the Lieutenant back in the Windy City, huh? Yeah, we were rookies together. She's a tough woman. You know that thing with her old man... You mean what, him dyin'? Yeah. You know, how he went out. Did it himself. Suicide? I didn't... I didn't know that. Yeah, she was thinking about resigning, too. Going back to Chicago. I guess he was in some kind of trouble. And then he wasn't. Here's your guidebook for the tour. Did the killer disable the alarm? We think Sweeney did. Comes home, shuts it off, doesn't turn it back on. What about the, uh, the camera at the front door? Did that see anything? Just Sweeney coming home. Who found the body? Cleaning lady, Monday afternoon. This way. Sliding door was left open, and the perp came in through there. What's behind this? Dirt road? Woods? What if the killer came through here? Well, you know. What if? Or maybe he parked out front and came around like we did. Did you check this out? Yeah, it's padlocked. Sweeney didn't have a key for it. It's not on his property anyway. There's an oil stain here. It's pretty fresh. Still wet. Your perp parked back here. Noted. Can we continue? Now this is where we found the body. I see that there are a lot of papers spread out, which means he was working, right? But here's what I don't understand, it's why would a thief come in when the resident is home? Well, the lights were off when we came in. So he was working in the dark? Something's not making sense to me, Denny. Why... why would the killer come to this angle, where Sweeney could see them? It's obvious the shooter had a solution for being identified. "Bang bang." They also took his wristwatch, his wallet, and his cell phone. Yeah. And your report says, "computer and a safe"? Yeah. This way. Hmm. Well, here it is. Maid said there was a small safe in that closet. The police turned this place upside down? No, that was the perp. Unless of course Sweeney's a slob. Travis. What's that? What is it? Nothing. It's just... Multnomah Falls. I was just telling Amy how much I'd like to visit there one day. Oh. Sweet. Are we done? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for the tour, Denny. Hey, do you mind if I hold onto this and read through it again? Lieutenant said give you what you need. Thanks. I'll give it back soon. Yeah. And hey, maybe you guys, uh, will find something that will break this case wide open, huh? Good to meet you both. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you. So you didn't tell him about Vicky because you want to interview her? Yeah, that and... And? You don't trust him. Bingo. Yeah. â™ª Excuse me. You can't just... What is going on? Ray Sweeney. It's all right, Madeline. Go on. You told us that McHale hired a new lawyer to sue you, but did you think to mention that his old lawyer was a guy that you clearly knew well enough that he had a framed photograph of the two of you standing in front of Multnomah Falls? A guy who was murdered two days before McHale? I had no idea. Ray had been working with Mitch. Okay, and we're just supposed to believe that? It's the truth. What was your relationship with Ray? We dated for a couple of months, but it ended. When? Four months ago. Who ended it? I did. Because? Because he'd become intolerable. Okay, could you fill us in on that? Ray was... incredibly successful. He bragged all the time about how he never lost a case. And then he did. And suddenly, he couldn't stop losing them. He became miserable. I stuck it out for a few months, but eventually enough was enough. Hmm. Have you seen him since? No. But he did call Saturday. Said he had turned things around, he was going to start winning again. Did he explain further? No. And to be honest, I didn't believe him, and I'd moved on. Did you know he was dead? Botched robbery, yes? So we're told. Thank you. Thanks for your time. Sorry to barge in on you, Vicky. She had an answer for everything, didn't she? Well, smart criminals do, and she's certainly smart. Yeah, but the question is, is she a criminal? Although, she didn't seem that broken up about Ray's murder. Yeah. You know, we should take this to Rachel. Yeah, yeah. Of course. But you know, just, I don't know, just let me do the talking. That would be wise. And we thought this is just one more thing that's tying the McHale case to Ray Sweeney. Yeah. You know and we thought that you should definitely keep digging into that connection. Like Detective Roma said, Sweeney was known as the Lucky Irishman because cases always broke his way. A witness would recant, evidence would get compromised, paperwork invalidated. So some people, me, started to wonder if this wasn't just luck. As if he had help from the inside. Did you look into it? I did. And? And before I found anything, Sweeney started to lose. This was six months ago. Right. So I thought maybe he was just lucky. Until he wasn't. Right. Right. Well. Hey, did you look over the crime scene report for the robbery-homicide of Sweeney? Um... I haven't really had the chance. Why? Well, look. It's pretty clear that the intruder entered while Sweeney was working, which would mean that the lights were on. Right, and then the person had to go around the couch to be seen by Sweeney, just to shoot him? I mean, if this was just a thief, why go through all that? Why not just come back? I mean, that doesn't... doesn't make any sense. And then they ransacked the office, and we don't really know what paperwork might've been taken. But what was stolen, other than a watch and a wallet, was his cell phone, his computer, and his safe. All things that contain information. So you think this is some kind of a hit? I think the evidence tells that story, yeah. Told you. What is it you teach again? Literature, with a focus on crime fiction. Sounds fun. Yeah. It is. And your assessment sounds correct. Did you mention this to Detective Roma? Yeah, we did, but... He didn't seem that interested. I'll talk to him. All right. Have you made any headway on the McHale case? We have a warrant for Alexis and Billy's phones and computers, but it'll take some time to go through. Yeah, well you might want to do the same thing with Vicky Lin. Definitely. Thank you. Yeah. Both of you. You're welcome. All right. Thanks. We'll see you. Hey, you want to go over the Sweeney case book without him looking over our shoulder? Well, don't you need to rehearse your talk? Oh, my talk's fine. Alright, let's go. Yeah? Yeah. Coroner says that the time of death was 10:30 PM. And apparently he talked to his assistant at 10:20. Do we know what they talked about? Privileged information, she said. Ahh. Hmm. You wouldn't happen to have a magnifying glass, would you? You kidding? What? You always wear one around your neck. I didn't pack it this time. Uh, maybe I can use the zoom on my phone. I just, uh... I want to try to find out what Sweeney was working on. It's just kind of hard to see. Oh wow. What are you looking at? Bingo. Divorce petition, wow. Mmhmm. So we need to find out if there was a prenup. And if there was, and he signed those papers, Alexis could've lost a lot of money in that divorce. And if Alexis went to talk to him, right, she finds out about it, she goes to talk to Sweeney, and he doesn't back down? She kills him. Or Billy could've killed her. You know, there's 24 hours' worth of footage from the front door security camera. Where? It's filed with physical evidence. Well, can we see it? I'm gonna call Roma. Uh, excuse me for a second. Roma, I need to ask you a favour. Hey. Hey Winslow. Uh, just wondering if you wanted to grab a bite? You know what, I've already eaten tonight, and I'm kind of working. With Travis? Uh, yeah. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow for your talk. Yeah, you will. Okay, bye. Sophie said we could view the footage in the briefing room. Okay, can we go now? -Yeah.-Awesome. Okay. That's 10:00 pm on Sunday. Let's slow it down. Huh. Looks like Roma was right about the killer not coming in from the front. Hang on. What? What is that? Is that a car? Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a car. Can you tell what model? It looks like Mitch McHale's ride. At 10:28, just before the time of death. I mean, we do know that Alexis has keys to that car. Yeah. It could be a coincidence. Well, we know what Miss Marple says about coincidence. Mmhmm. Let's see if our guy turns around. Mmm. Wait a minute, where did it go? That road ends in a cul-de-sac. I have an idea. Come on. You were right, the dirt road connects to the cul-de-sac, which means McHale driving back this way makes sense. -Right.-Yeah. And... an oil stain. You don't get that from an electric motor. Mm-mm. So, that means it was someone else. You break into that house, you shoot a guy, you ransack that office, that takes what, 15 minutes at most? Yeah. But to leave an oil stain this big, you have to have your car parked longer than that. So I think that our killer was waiting for Ray Sweeney to return home, which would prove that this wasn't a robbery gone wrong. Yeah. What? -Hey, Travis?-Yeah. Door's open. Hey. Hello? Hi. Is that your shed? Hey, hey, it's okay little buddy. Look, I'm a cop. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on, hold on! Listen. I'm not a cop. Okay? My name is Amy. I'm a teacher. I'm an actually an English teacher, and we just... Hey. We just want to talk. Yeah. We just want to talk. Owen Shea, my name is Detective Travis Burke, this is Amy Winslow. Look, we don't want to cause you trouble. I just have a few questions that we need to ask. Okay. We don't want to take away your clubhouse. That's why you were running away, right? Yeah. You were afraid that the Detective here was going to arrest you for trespassing? Do you play Sylvan Quests? Yeah? Do you mind if I go in? Sure. Oh. Because I play. Well, I mean, I haven't played in a while. But I'm a dragon-borne wizard. I am! Were you here Sunday night at 10:00 PM? Were you with friends? My friends had left. They're younger than me. I'm the QM. The what? It's, um, Quest Master. He organizes the game. So you have, uh, arrow loops here, right? It's to fire an arrow from the castle? Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. That's awesome. Yeah. You guys LARP, too? All right, stop, stop. Okay, what is LARP? You want to tell him? Um, it's Live Action Role Play. Like, we do like battles and stuff, and this is our castle. Yeah, okay. Yeah. All right. So, Owen... Could you see a car pull up from one of those arrow loops? Yeah. Did ya? Yeah. What did it look like? Nothing special. It was like, four-door sedan. Did you... happen to hear any shots fired? Yeah. And did you happen to see another car pull up that same night? Yeah, so it was, uh, it was parked here right before the shots. And would you call the car that was parked here "special" in any way? Like, did it look like this? Wow, wizard skills, yeah! Did you get a good look at the guy's face? Um, no. Not at first, you know. It was dark and I was heading back to the HQ. Um, the shed. Yeah, so I was sort of hiding over there, right after the shots. Then the guy in the cool car gets out, checks out the boring car, uh, cool car guy had a flashlight, but then he just goes back to his ride and sits in the dark. And you stayed? Yeah. I was kind of frozen. Then maybe like 10,15 minutes later, another guy comes through the gate, and then he puts something in the trunk of the sedan and drives off. A guy. The driver was a man? I... I mean, I think. They were wearing pants, I... I don't know. Hmm. And then what? Cool guy flips his flashlight back on, then he goes through the gate, and then I go and checkout his ride, but the guy comes back pretty quick and I have to duck and hide behind his car. And that's when you got a look at him? Yeah. Here. Was it one of these guys? Middle guy. You're sure? 100 percent. Well, thank you. You have been more than helpful. Do you live around here, your mom or your dad? Yeah. We're just a few blocks away. You want to hop in the car and we'll give you a ride home? Boring four-door sedan, huh? Yeah, you know who drives a car like that? Yep. Police detective. Hmm. Excuse me. Hi. My name is Detective Burke, I'm from Garrison PD. Is Lieutenant Knox in? Give me a minute. Thanks. Hey, Travis. Hey, what's up? Come here. Detective Dennis Roma broke both legs falling down a flight of stairs but still managed to catch the culprit. When did Sweeney start losing cases? Uh, six months ago. Detective? Yeah. Uh, Lieutenant Knox is gone for the day. Okay. Hey, listen. I got a... I got a question for you. Uh, after Detective Roma broke both his legs, when did he get back on the job? Just two months ago. Is he in? Uh, he clocked out at 4:00. Can I get his address? I promised I'd get this back to him tonight. We should hurry before someone else gets killed. Yeah. Oh, hi. Is everything okay? Yeah, sorry for dropping by. We just wanted to show you something. Oh, um, I'm actually just running out. Five minutes. It's important. Okay. Come on in. So what's up? Well, we think we know how the Sweeney and McHale murders are connected. Seriously? Yeah. Yeah, so, Ray Sweeney was handling Mitchell McHale's divorce. Um, see these files? I took a picture of them and I zoomed in on it. Now he had all the paperwork ready for Mitchell to sign the night that Sweeney was murdered. Now, what we also know is that Mitchell's car was there that night. Okay, but there's more than one of those. Well here's the thing. We have a witness. Yeah. And he saw McHale's car parked behind Sweeney's house, and he identified Mitchell McHale as the driver. Wait... What witness? Yeah, we'll... we'll get to that. But this witness also saw a four-door sedan parked behind Sweeney's house. The kind that a detective would drive. And the driver of this sedan is the person that walked into Ray Sweeney's house, just before 10:30, and shot him dead. Travis, that is a... A serious accusation? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, we know. That's why we wanted to talk to you. You wanted to talk to me instead of Denny Roma. Well, I mean, you said that, uh, you suspected that there was an inside man in the police department, right? Someone that was helping Sweeney with his cases. Well, ostensibly, that person was doing this for money. Roma. But then six months ago, Sweeney started losing cases. Roma must've stopped helping him, I mean, probably because you started looking into it. Yeah, but here's the thing. Sweeney, he told Vicky Lin on Saturday that he had a plan to start winning again. So my guess is is that, I don't know, that Sweeney told Roma, you start helping me again, or I'm going to tell your department what you've been doing. Blackmail. But Roma has a different solution. Kill Ray Sweeney Stage it as a robbery. Steal all the evidence that tied him to Sweeney. But here's what he couldn't have known. Mitchell McHale showed up to sign his divorce papers just before the shots were fired. And so when Roma was loading up his car and driving off, Mitchell McHale was watching from the dark. And our witness saw McHale enter the house after that, so he knew that the cop that just left killed his lawyer. Mmhmm. Now what we all know is that Mitchell McHale had a software program for the police departments. Vicky Lin says it's a sham, but McHale told us that... I should be closing a deal tonight for Seattle Metro PD to license my S.L.O.O.T.H software. I mean, you do the math. McHale must've contacted Roma. Told him he knew what he did. Maybe even had photos of Roma putting Sweeney's stuff in the trunk of his car. McHale must've told Roma that he had to get S.L.O.O.T.H into Seattle Metro, or else he'd blow the whistle on him. Roma must've arranged for them to meet on the rooftop. Where there are no cameras. So the cop commits a second murder to cover up the first. Um... I'm... I'm just... I'm stunned. I... I need to talk to Roma. I've known him for years, I... It needs to be me that brings him in. Yeah. Yeah, see, we thought you would say that. You were running out to see Roma when we got here, weren't you? Excuse me? Rachel, we just came from Roma's. You going somewhere, Detective? Yeah, why? We need to talk, now. He told us that you called him to set up a meeting. And we're the ones that told him to call you and push that meeting. Okay, I... I don't know what you're... Rachel... Roma can't Bethe inside man. No, he was on leave for a year. He just got back on the job two months ago. But the inside man was working for Sweeney up until six months ago. Six months. Six months, that kept rattling around in my head, and then I figured it out. Something else happened six months ago. Your dad died. Yeah. Money was always an issue, and finally he opened his own shop. And he lost it. And she lost him. Yeah. How he went out. Did it himself. Suicide. I didn't... I didn't know that. She was talking about resigning, too. Moving back to Chicago. I guess he was in some kind of trouble, and then he wasn't. And so I called our old friend, Captain Lowe in Chicago, and he told me that he looked into your dad's suicide, and he said that your dad started his bake shop with a loan from the mob, and as the years went by, that debt, it got bigger, and Rachel I know how much you loved your father. But what I didn't know was that you would be willing to do anything to help him out, including selling yourself out to a crooked lawyer for money. But that wasn't enough, was it? So your dad did what he did, and then there was no need for you to resign anymore. You know, it was all over, it was all behind you. But then Sweeney came and... and threatened to blackmail you, but you solved enough crimes to know how to commit one. Robbery gone wrong, victim nobody cared about. The case would soon grow cold, it was perfect. I mean, McHale threw a little wrench in there, but you handled that. And then I handed Billy Poole to you on a silver platter. But when we started to connect the murders, you knew that you had to shift from the framing Billy angle, and you waited to see how far we got, and then you had to make Roma your fall guy. You were meeting with Roma tonight to close the loop. And what was your story going to be, Rachel? Huh? That you went there and tried to convince Roma to turn himself in, but instead he tried to kill you, so you did what you had to do? He's a cop. I mean, of course you wouldn't call in the shooting until after you loaded everything that you stole from Sweeney's house and Mitchell's cell phone into the trunk of Roma's car. It's all in the trunk of your car ready to go, isn't it? Tell you what, Rachel? Why don't we just go out and take a look? Rachel. Come on. If you're innocent, I'll tell you how sorry I am. I just... You know, you... you do... you do one thing and you just don't, you don't think. I mean, it's not like I had this big master plan, I just... That first case with Sweeney. His client was innocent. I was trying to do something good. You got paid to do it. Yes, but to help my dad. After everything he'd done, I just... I just wanted to keep his dream alive. You killed two people, Rachel. Two terrible people. No. No. We don't get to decide who lives and who dies. I'm so sorry, Travis. I ruined everything. Thanks for everything, and for saving my life. And I trusted her. You take care, Denny. Thank you. -Bye-bye.-Thank you. You know, I know how he feels. I know I haven't seen her in years, but there was a time when, you know, we trusted each other with our lives. Yeah. You know, Bud's lecture for class this week was all about trust. The original definition means "alliance." Well, Amy. I'm glad that you're my ally. Likewise. I'm tired. Yeah, me too. And yet I still have a teachable talk to rehearse for tomorrow. Hmm. Ouch. And so, why are mysteries one of the most popular forms of fiction in the whole entire history of the world? Why? Well, if you push aside the tropes and the suspects and the settings, you're left with an answer that is, well, what Holmes might say is "elementary," my dear. Uh, mystery novels are really just an expression of what might just be our greatest human quality. Our curiosity. Our passion to discover. Our desire to know, and to answer not only "whodunnit," but also who we are. Thank you. Thank you! Did you see everybody? Bud, Holly and Claire? Hey, how do you think they got here? You, come here. Thank you! Aww. See, you can be thoughtful. Yeah, well, I have my moments. You do. You do. So, how was I? Amy. Was it okay? You were fantastic. Yeah? Yes. Okay. Okay. Hey, you want to go home? Hey. Hey, hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You were incredible, honey. Oh! Thank you. We're so proud of you. Thank you, thank you guys so much for coming. You were so good. That was amazing, Amy. Oh. To Amy!
