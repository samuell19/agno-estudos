[Relaxed electronic music] [mid tempo electronic music] [steady tempo drumbeat] - Nice to see you. [Mid tempo electronic music] [mid tempo electronic music] [steady tempo drumbeat] [low electronic tones] - You look better already. No lying down and no martinis for an hour, all right? - Thank you, Alex. - Just keep the swab on it. Don't get blood on my furniture. We'll keep chipping away at the drab little moth you were born until we find the butterfly. Smoking causes slow and painful death. Isn't that right, Percy Katt? Why are you here, Thalia? - To see you. I called earlier but you didn't pick up. - You didn't stop to consider why? - Alex please, let's not start this all again. - No need to, you'll be leaving now. - Are you serious? - If you'd like to stay, you'll have to smooth out those hideous crevasses in your forehead. You can have a seat on the sofa, I'll be with you in one second. - [Thalia] Remember a time when you didn't inject and operate on all your friends? - These aren't friends, they're patients seeking my help. If they approach a physical ideal I can tolerate, I sometimes learn their names. - It's sick. - Sick? You come to my home without an invitation and tell me how I behave is sick? Drew, will you get a car for Thalia? She won't be staying with us any longer. - [Drew] Yes sir. - It's a pity. Might've been halfway beautiful with some work. It always amazes me how horribly lazy people are. I generously offer her a way to improve herself and she refuses, rudely at that. [Mid tempo electronic music] - I heard you had good parties Alex but this is impressive. - Had we known you swung our way, we would've crashed one a long time ago. - I don't remember giving permission to speak. For that matter, I don't recall sending an invitation to either of you. But you're here now and that's what matters. I'm sure we'll find some way to entertain ourselves. [Slap] - Why does he hate me? All I ever tried to do was love him and it was never enough. He's getting stranger, Drew. When he looks at me now, it's so vacant. - Alex is very much concerned with the shape of things, with form. Admittedly he can be hot and cold at times but the beauty of it is there's no guessing with him. One always knows where one stands in his eyes. If you stop fulfilling a function, his attention is drawn elsewhere. - What about all the soldiers who are still blind from gas attacks? Disfigured or left without a limb from a landmine? How can his attention be drawn away from that? The Alex I fell in love with is a genius, an artist who cares about actually healing people. Now it's just a relentless pursuit of perfection, one that only he can seem to grasp and everyone just goes along for the ride. - So why do you keep coming back? He's told you to stay away. - He can still be reasoned with. I'm not giving up on him, Drew. I'm not. [Light up tempo electronic tones] - I'm afraid you won't. - Gentlemen, it is standard practice to bring a gift to the host of a party. I understand being absent-minded but I don't forgive it. I am forced to take a gift for myself. And you're offering so many attractive options. [Metallic clanking] [knocking] - I'm busy. I said I'm busy. [Anxious low electronic tones] - Sorry sir, I barged in but she's threatening to kill herself. - Well, I suppose I should have a word with her, shouldn't I? - Yes mistress. - Now what do you say to your mistress? - Thank you. - Good boy. Good boy. - You are a vision, aren't you? You must be because I'm sure I told you I never wanted to see you again and yet here you are, back in my life, in my own backyard. Dear sweet Thalia, I got lost in there, tasting you for nearly an hour. Remember? Of course you do. Such a sweetly broken rose. Why are you here? - I needed to know that you're still the man I fell in love with, that I still mean something to you and you came. I can't stop thinking about you. You've changed and maybe you don't notice it but I do. Everyone was affected by the war but it doesn't have to make us inhumane. All of this can stop. You can't fix everyone. The world wasn't perfect before and neither were any of us, no matter how we may remember it. - The party's over. Thank you so much for coming. I said thank you! - You told me you loved me. - Love is an irregularity. Shapeless, no base, no conventions. To say love may have been overly ambitious and methodical. - Alex please, I can't go on without you, you have to listen-- - Have to? Are you giving me an ultimatum? - I'll inject this so I can stop thinking about you. - How tragic. What cocktail have you chosen to taunt me with? - [Thalia] Procainamide. - Astute choice. Something to stop that little heart beating with so much love. You're not doing this, Thalia. You're confused and tired. You just need sleep. We'll talk about all this with a straight head tomorrow. [Splash] Pity, our last play time left a few marks. You're a modern couple, I get that. But what I don't understand is why if you supposedly love each other so much, you're always seeking to play with others. My only conclusion is that neither of you has ever or can ever be fully satisfied by the other. This in turn leads me to believe that an ideal form of love may not exist and I may therefore never find it. It occurs to me that instead of trying to satisfy each other and nurture the less than ideal love you had, you've become greedy. Comfortable laying around in your own piss and shit and everyone else's. Like a couple of swine. [Urine trickling] Let me leave you with a hot tip from my stockbroker. It's all right to be a pig, pig's get fat and happy. But when you turn gluttonous and become a hog, watch out. Hogs get slaughtered. [Knife slashing] [rhythmic humming] Drew, yes will you inform any remaining guests that I've retired for the night? That's right, party's over. Oh and when you've finished down there, I've made a little mess. Nothing unbearable but you may want to bring a disinfectant. Oh and Drew, thank you. - Yes. Yes. As soon as possible. Thank you. [Knocking] - Coming. [Anxious low warbling tones] - There. It's fair now, isn't it? You hit me first. [Weeping] [gun cocks] [mid tempo electronic tones] [heavy breathing, grunting] [knocking] - [Alex] I'm busy, Drew. - [Drew] Sir, I think that maybe you-- - I said I was fucking busy! [Grunt] [glass shatters] Do you understand what that means, you witless shit? Why are you so eager to please, Drew? - [Drew] I love working for you, sir. - Love. Love is a word that people drop like litter, carelessly. A simple word that supposedly holds so much meaning. None of which I've ever been able to grasp. And you, you're the closest match I've found. - We should get you cleaned up. - Call me Alex. - Yes sir, Alex. - Do you think I'm beautiful? - Beautiful? - Would you like to kiss me? - Kiss you? - Kiss me. - Yes. - Wrong answer. [Alex groans] [sputtering] Oh Drew, what a mess you've made of your face. You're hard to tease sometimes Drew, but I like the adoration. I bet you enjoyed walking in on me last night. I'm finally gonna give you what you want. Pity, you're not even alive to taste it. That was hot, old buddy. But there's something not quite right. Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but when there is nothing left to take away. [Knocking] The body is left stripped down to its nakedness. Is it so much to ask for an equal? Simply beautiful. That's so beautiful. [Gunshot booms] [relaxed electronic music] [relaxed harmonica music] [classic up tempo rock music] - What are we gonna do for six months? - Six months and four days. - Well look who's counting. - The days, the hours, the minutes. I've just had one thing on my mind. Just waiting for you to get off that ship so I can bring you here to the woods where we can do whatever we want, be whoever we want and make love as much as we want. I missed you, Will. - I missed you too, Matteo. Matteo, I-- - You what? - The guys on the ship, they sometimes bring guys back to their bunks even if they have girls or guys back home. I'm enlisted for at least another two years and I keep thinking about how hard it is to be apart for so long. Maybe we can let off some steam once in awhile to make the time apart a bit easier. Is that something you could see us doing? - No. - I love you because you're my man and I'm yours. I'm not talking about opening up our hearts. Just our pants. ♪ Why don't ya do what ya do, what ya do, what ya do what ♪ ♪ Why don't ya do what ya do, what ya do, what ya do ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪ Why do you do what you do ♪ When you do, it makes me feel so blue ♪ ♪ So I ask you too ♪ Why do you do what you do - Sure, I've thought about being with other guys but this has always been enough for me. We've been together for five years, high school sweethearts. Despite it starting with a fistfight. - Yeah, I don't blame you for wanting to knock some sense into me. - Do I have to knock some sense into you again? You just got back. Why are you talking about being with other people? - Being with other guys once in awhile isn't gonna change the way we feel about each other. I think we should be honest about what we want. - So what do you want? - I want you to be happy when I'm away. I don't want guilt to be any part of our relationship. - So if I meet some handsome cowboy-- - I hope you give him the ride of his life and if some army brat catches my eye during Fleet Week, it's just one night. - You think it's that easy? - Actually I think it's gonna be pretty hard sometimes but I'd rather we're honest about it and with a little effort, maybe we can even be happy for each other and that if we can't be together, this might be the next best thing. [Light ensemble music] [relaxed jazzy trumpet music] You know I've never told you this before but sometimes I get scared. - Of what? - Dying I guess, that's what it sums up to. Every time we go out to sea, I say a little prayer. It's automatic, it's like a habit. I whisper to myself I can die today and everything can be all right because I've had an amazing life. But would the ritual truly exist if I believed that? No. The truth is I'm afraid. It's not something we talk about as soldiers but I'm guessing we all feel it. - It's okay to be afraid. I'm afraid too, every time you leave. - I still get the nightmares sometimes, not as much but-- - Will, I'll be with you if they come. - I was hoping that we could stay awake for awhile. - Oh I'm awfully tried, I don't know how I could possibly stay up. - I've got some ideas. [Relaxed guitar tones] Do you remember this? - I remember this. - Do you remember we used to dance to this? - I don't know, can you show me? - You need a refresher? - Yeah.

Maybe only when we're away from each other for more than a month. It's up to us. We make the rules. - Maybe even sharing a guy once in awhile could be fun. - So this isn't about me not being there? - No, I want you there. This could be exciting, be something to share together. [Splashing] No more rough play. - I can be gentle. - Yeah right. Hey, come on down for a swim. - Will. - [Will] What, maybe he could be our third. - You're crazy. - Guess he doesn't like rough play. - Well I guess you're just stuck with me. [Fire crackling] - I love you. - Me too. Will, did you just touch my back? - I'm touching you all over. - I know but I felt a third hand on my back. - You're just fantasizing, already thinking about our hiker friend from this afternoon. - I know what I felt. - Look at me. It's just me and you okay, no one else. You're letting the woods spook you again. I'm right here and I'm not gonna let anything hurt you. - I know. - As far as I'm concerned, there's only one disturbing thing going on here. - Oh yeah, what's that? - You stopped kissing me. Good morning, babe. - Not yet. - I'll get coffee started. I guessed you were afraid of water when you didn't join us yesterday. - I'm just not a strong swimmer. - Army? - I was, yeah. - If you're feeling brave, I'm a sailor. Saving people is part of the job. - Even those that don't need saving? Here. Daniel. - I'm Will. - The pleasure is mine. - You have breakfast yet? I was just about to make some joe. Come on. [Laughs] So after two months, it turns out that we were shooting at each other the entire time. - This is a great spot. - Yeah, it's not bad. Here we are. This is it. I'm sorry we only have two cups but you can have mine. - So Daniel, are you out here alone? - Yeah. After I was discharged from the Army, I was feeling pretty lost in the city. I couldn't find a job, so I came out here to think about what to do next. - How long have you been out here? - The plan was to come for a week but it's been several now. But I just can't seem to move on. I know I can't stay out here forever but I'm just nervous for what comes next. - Why not stay in the Army? There are still plenty of jobs even though the war's over. - I was given a Blue Ticket. - What's that? - A dishonorable discharge given to homosexuals. You get cut off from any benefits from the GI Bill and have to disclose the reason you were discharged if asked at a job interview. - The military is great at enlisting us but damn shitty at returning us to civilian life. - Yeah, especially guys like us. - I heard it's better in the Navy. - Let's hope so. - You guys have a great spot here. It's close to the river. If you want, I could show you this great day hike. It'll save you the trouble of breaking and setting up camp somewhere else. - I wouldn't mind a day without my pack. Where to? - Don't you like a little mystery? - It's beautiful. - I used to come up here a lot. If you focus, you can sense everything happening all around you. But from up here I'm just an observer. I can give up the constant searching. I get to be detached from it all and uninterrupted. - Searching for what? - Meaning I guess. - Do you mind if I ask, what happened? Why'd you get the Blue Ticket? - A guy. A beautiful guy. We had become friends stationed in Italy and there was this party the last night before I leave and then a little too much whiskey. It's funny how it starts in sips and ends in gulps. His eyes, they made me shudder inside. I'd always known it was different, the look that is. The one that he reserved for me. I guessed he was at least curious but I didn't push. Scaring him off would be worse than not having him at all. He smiled at me over his glass, I returned the favor, it was impossible not to and then he kissed me and I'm not even sure where it began. It was just one fluid motion and we were close, close and closer still. I knew where his preferences lied but not that night. All that mattered in that moment were his lips pressed against mine and I guess that's when someone saw us and reported it. By morning, I'd been given a Blue Ticket. I told 'em in was my fault, that I instigated it and he gotta stay 'cause he didn't deny it. - I'm really sorry. - He may have been the one for me but I was never the one for him. He was exploring and I don't fault him for that. I think it's healthy to test your boundaries. It can give you a stronger sense of who you are and what shape you want your life to take. Come on, it's a steep trip down we don't wanna make after nightfall. [Jazzy ensemble music] It's beautiful, what you two have. How'd you guys meet? - It was ninth grade. I picked a fight with him. Called him out into the street. At least this way, he would touch me. It's snowing and I slip on the street but he holds me up by the shirt just to knock me down again. My jaw hits the asphalt, crimson in the dirty snow and he's calling me out for more and I want it. More than anything. I haven't gotten one good hit in. Hurting him crushed me inside. So I let him beat me. Someone pulls him off and I don't want them to. I was finally close to him. He won the fight but so did I. - We both did. - Daniel, why don't you spend the night with us? It'll be a whole lot warmer. - Only if it's okay with you. - Yeah. ♪ Whoa ♪ This love in my life ♪ I know he's there for me ♪ He'd climb the highest peak ♪ And he'd swim the widest sea ♪ He's so crazy ♪ We're so crazy ♪ About ♪ Our love ♪ Oh, about ♪ Our love [relaxed jazzy guitar, trumpet music] - [Will] He must've moved on. - A goodbye would've been nice. - What was it he said on the hill?

The body of a young man was found in the Elora Gorge area of Grand River. The coroner report states there is no sign of foul play and the death has been deemed a drowning accident. The body of the deceased is thought to have been in the river for several weeks before being discovered by a local fisherman. The young man has been identified as 22 year old former soldier Daniel Donauer. While enlisted in the Army, he served in Italy before receiving a dishonorable discharge. Friends and family have yet to come forward to claim the body.

Be with me Lord when I am in trouble. Be with me Lord, I pray. [Weeping] I don't know what to say. Look, I don't see God when I look at you. I just see the money that this church paid me to create the monstrosity that they kneel before every sunrise and sunset. A man nailed brutally to a tree and left to die. Endless anguish and suffering continuing without relief into eternity. - Rudy, I'm so pleased to have you join me this morning. - Of course, Father. - We'd like to commission you for a second piece, Rudy. We've decided on a painting of St. Bacchus. He was in the Roman Army, Second Commander to St. Sergius. The earliest reports on their story refer to Sergio and Bacchus as erostai, the Greek word for-- - Lovers. - Lovers. They were tortured, separated and so badly beaten that Bacchus died. That night in prison, Sergius had a vision. Bacchus appeared to him in his soldier's armor and promised him that they'd be reunited in Heaven. Sergius' tortures continued and he was finally beheaded. - Another happy ending. - Unfortunately the people worth remembering often had tragic ends. I'll ask our librarian to pull some material and courier it over to your studio this afternoon. - Perfect, as always a pleasure, Father. - How are you, Rudy? - I'm fine. I just haven't felt inspired to come without-- - Xavier. - Yeah, without Xavier. I can't believe it's been a year. - You were so strong through his illness. - [Rudy] What choice did I have? - Life is riddled with choices. You chose to stay by your friend's side when many would have left. - I couldn't have left. I loved him, I still love him. - I know. Don't lose faith. - Thank you, Father. - Can you believe this? This is all ours. I can't believe how big this place is. - I'm glad you're excited. - Excited, babe I'm freaking out. You could paint right here. We could sleep over there and my piano, my piano could go over here. As soon as we can afford all it. - Buying you a piano is the first thing we do. - Really, before we get a bed? - No no no, piano first so you can write hit songs which will pay for the bed. - Right, okay.

You were shortchanged in having your model for David. My Xavier is beyond words. Beautiful. Exquisitely perfect. Gone, a sacrifice to a marble god. A god who doesn't answer prayers and now I'm wandering alone, making paintings destined to collect dust in empty churches. Cold and motionless, frozen in time. Frozen myself, can't feel anymore. [Relaxed guitar, flute music] Paint another Saint, manifest another tragic life. Frame it in ornate gold as a reminder of how shitty life can be. How were you tortured, St. Bacchus? Were you fed to lions, pierced with arrows, dismembered, beheaded? Were you willing to die for your faith or for Sergius? In the end, did it even matter? Should I immortalize you carrying a skull as a reminder of our fleeting mortality or with a sword through your tortured heart? Hellenistic, what happened to the concept of holding art as a testament to human achievement, to transcendence? [Relaxed flute music] Eros and Psyche intertwined under the heavy branches of an olive tree, blissfully unaware of the passage of centuries. Heracles himself, the embodiment of brute strength and courage, cloaked in lion's head and club.

I made a list so you'll no exactly what to do. - What kind of a list? - The funeral. The music, friends to call, the flowers. Calla lilies. But you could've guessed that 'cause you know they're my favorite. - Hey, let's go to a movie tonight you know? They're doing a Delan retrospective at the Arts Club. - Rudy. - Forever since we've gone. - We need to talk about this. Look, it's all in here. I made a list of things I want to go to certain people and there's a few pages in here I'd like for you to read at the service. - Don't talk like this. - I just want things to be easy for you when it happens. - Easy, how is any of this gonna be easy? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I know, I know. I shouldn't have-- - No I'll take, give me this. - Forget about this tonight, forget it. Forget it. - How are you gonna make me forget it?

Come to me. [Weeping] [soft somber guitar music] [rhythmic humming] [tea kettle whistling] [soft somber guitar music] - [Rudy] I just want sleep to be a black void, dreamless. Providing an escape from the monotony of my days. [Cell phone ringing] Anything would be better than the nightmare. I'm so tired but I'm terrified to go to sleep. I yearn for that dreamless void now, to stretch that eclipse from reality into an eternity. To jump into the river of time and be washed away before anyone has the opportunity to notice. I don't want to hurt anyone. I just want my death to happen in a blink. Let the world shut and open its eyes and I will be gone forever, never to be remembered. No memorial service for me. [Anxious somber violin, piano music] - [Xavier] I think we should move to Paris. - What? - I'm serious, Rudy. - [Xavier] Look, if you want to move beyond fashioning Saints and the Madonna for members of the clergy, you're gonna have to make a name for yourself on the international art scene. - [Rudy] You wanna leave? - Not forever but for awhile, yeah. Look, we both know Macondre who owns that little art gallery in Montmartre. I'm sure he could help you out and you know, you could meet the right people and... Look, let's explore, Rudy. Let's try to live in a world that we don't know so intimately. - Yeah but this is our home. - And our home will still be here when we get back. I say we go, we try it out for a year. I'll keep writing my music and perform. You could work on your art and your French. - You brat, that's the motivation. - Come on, think of it. Do you remember when we met in Le Maurer? - It was at that little bakery with the best macaroons in the whole world. - Yeah or so they claimed. - That's why I had to go to France in the first place to taste the best dessert and find the love of my life. - Will you think about it? - Yes. - All right. - Thank you. Thank you. You won't regret this, I promise. - What are you doing, who are you calling? - Hello mama. - Xavier. - Oui, c'est Xavier. Listen she's be excited, you're just thinking about it. Mama. [Speaking French] [laughs] [somber soft piano music] - I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd come and talk. Oh, it's a good thing I live alone huh Xavier? I bet you're having a good laugh at me right now. I've been thinking more about what you said about moving to Paris and I think we should do it. We can rent out our place here. Some art students from the university will surely take it and we'll go. We'll go for a year and just see if we like it. I just need to finish this painting for the church and then we'll... I would give anything just to hear you say you love me one more time. - I'm cold. [Somber soft ensemble music] We talked about this. I'm tired. This has to stop. It's no way for us to live. Please. Please. [Somber deep piano tones] [weeping] - I don't know if I can do this. I love you with all my soul. You know that, right? - I love you. I'm ready. [Soft somber ensemble tones] It's okay. [Deep somber cello tones] - Xavier. I'm so cold. Lonely. Friends have told me that I need to move on and I tried. I'm sorry. I'm sorry but I thought maybe they were right and that if I just found someone knew, that it would help get rid of this ache. Sometimes I wonder if it could get any worse and then it does. The emptiness squeezes a little tighter, a little tighter. Threatening to choke yet mercilessly pushing me through to one more day. If only I could forget the present. I'm dying for your kiss. Just looking at you, I get that unsettling, excited feeling and it's the first time since we... I'd take you back. Sick and dying, puking and shitting, all of it. I'd rather have you in that awful state than be here alone with nothing to give me even a phantom sense of satisfaction. Food is tiresome, conversation could lead to a shooting spree and sex with anyone but you is vile and repulsive. How can I be so twisted and empty and you stand there so fucking beautiful? Xavier. Look at me. Please Xavier, just for an instant, just so I know that some piece of you is still out there. Xavier. Xavier, look at me. Why won't you look at me? - I've lived here alone with the memory of the dreadful thing I did that night. You think I'm mad, don't you? - You know I don't believe in you anymore, don't you? Now I know we're not supposed to test you. Another scrap of info I recall from Catechism. I'm not testing, I'm already beyond believing. I love Xavier with every piece of my being and I know that your PR people don't condone that but it's true and incontestable. As sure as the ocean's tide. So I'd appreciate if you could pass on a message for me because I'm pretty sure he'll be in your arena. Tell him I love him. Tell him I can't do this anymore without him and so I'm crossing over to find him.
