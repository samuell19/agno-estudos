SOAMES: Is that the last of it, Bilson? BILSON: Yes, sir. Is Mrs. Forsyte ready? Nearly, sir. Send my best to Miss Hester, sir. Eighty today. Put them in the car, Williams. We're going to be late. What is Mrs. Forsyte doing? GIRL: Ow! I wanted to wear my party dress. It's afternoon tea. The dress is far too formal. I wanted to! Sometimes we cannot do everything we want. Daddy! Fleur! Daddy! Daddy! SOAMES: Yeah? Daddy! What's the matter? I'm wearing silly blue, and it will crumple and Aunt Hester loves me ever so in white... Calm yourself, my love. I thought my satin... ANNETTE: The blue muslin is much more suitable. The satin. Why not? I'll change right away. Help me, Bilson! ( softly ): I love you, Daddy. JUNE: We deserve the right to vote, to be heard as a part of the universal voice of mankind. WOMAN: Well said! We do not deserve to be imprisoned without representation, force-fed like animals, tubes thrust down our innocent throats. ( women shouting "Bravo!" ) Thank you. What do you think, Jon? All those ladies... shouting. ( chuckles ) Can you bear one more lady? I need to finish up here, and then we'll visit my aunt. As long as she's not a shouter. ( laughing): Jon! Wasn't it fantastic? * For she's a jolly good fellow * ( all join in ): * For she's a jolly good fellow * * For she's a jolly good fellow * * And so say all of us! Oh, my dear. Come and blow the candles out! You do it, Fleur. ( blows ) HESTER: Oh, well done. WINIFRED: Let's get this cut, shall we? GEORGE: I can think of more profitable ways of spending my afternoon. DARTIE: Of course, the old girl has money to leave-- stacks of it. Do you think Winifred's in with a chance? No, it'll all go to that poppet, Fleur. June! Dartie... George. Been roped into the family do? "Do"? Hester's birthday. Must be away with the fairies if she's invited you. ( George laughs ) I mean, it's not you. It's the family feud and all that. She hasn't invited me. I was in London, and I thought I'd drop in. Oh. It'll be very nice to see everyone. And what a perfect opportunity for them all to meet Jon. Jon? Jon? Irene and Father's boy, you know. Aunt Hester, apologies for the tardiness. A very happy birthday. Oh, George, how kind. DARTIE: Aunt Hester. HESTER: Montague. Thank you, my dear, thank you. Any entertainment planned for this afternoon? What do you mean? Fireworks perhaps? MAID: I will tell them you're here, Miss Forsyte. JUNE: No need. Aunt Hester... it's your birthday. I should have remembered. June, my dear, how lovely to see you. We didn't think... I was at a meeting in Acton. Acton! It's quite close. The bus took hardly any time. The bus! JUNE: This terrible injustice of force-feeding our women in prison-- we have to protest against it. Hello, Soames. June. What are the authorities expected to do? Simply stand by and let these hysterical women starve? ANNETTE: It's a point of principle. I rather admire it. Absurd! If you start marching... What will you do? Lock me up? ( Annette giggles ) I'm Soames's wife... Annette. Delighted to meet you. And this is my half brother, Jon. Irene's son. He has her looks, her eyes. Let's go into the garden. Come on. This way. It's a jolly nice garden. You'll find lots to play with. Come on, this way. FLEUR: * Hush, little baby, don't say a word * * Daddy's going to buy you a mockingbird * * If that mockingbird don't sing * * Daddy's going to buy you a diamond ring... * ( Fleur hums song ) FLEUR: Got you! Don't do that. What should I do then? Tickle them. Come on then. My dress! What about it? What next? I'm going to catch him. No! Here he is. No! ( Fleur squeals ) ( both laughing ) JUNE: So I'm looking after Jon. WINIFRED: Are you all right? SOAMES: Fine. HESTER: Some cake? No, thank you. Soames, where's Fleur? ( Fleur squealing in distance) ( both laughing ) Fleur! Daddy. Come and see these fish! They're as big as sharks! Don't touch me! Jon! SOAMES: Inside. But... SOAMES: Now! Get that boy out of here. They were just playing. I don't want him anywhere near my daughter. JUNE: For goodness' sake! SOAMES: He's the result of a filthy liaison-- illegitimate in all but name. He's a dirty... savage little... That's enough! Soames, he's a child. Yes, and he's a great deal better behaved than you. Come on, Jon. What did I do wrong? Nothing. That man-- he was so... We shan't talk of it. And we shan't talk of it to Mother or Dad either when they come home tomorrow. It will be our secret. Home... IRENE: It's always such a joy to come back. You must be tired. No. No, just longing to see him. JUNE: There they are! I told you I heard a car. IRENE: Jon! JON: Mum! Dad! Jon! Look at your face! Yes, look at you! You've been at my watercolors, you rascal! They're still wet. How are you? Hello. JUNE: How was it? IRENE: Very good. How are you? Very well, thank you. We've had lots of fun. Yes, it looks like it. Cowboys! ( imitates war cry ) JON: We saw one like this in London. London? We went to a rally. I helped decorate the banner! Then on to the aunt. IRENE: Oh... Which... Whose aunt? We dropped in on Hester. JON: It was fun, until the man got so angry. What did he do? He shouted... at me. Come on, old chap. Let's see how she runs in the gallery. Like a bird, I bet! I didn't think Soames would be there. What did he do to Jon? Nothing! He upset him. I took him away. He shouldn't have been there in the first place! Is everything all right here? I'm going back to London. No... no, you're staying for supper. You don't want me. June, we love you. You say that. We couldn't do without you. Let's just forget this ever happened. Then perhaps Jon will, too. ( car horn beeps ) Spare a penny, governor? SOAMES: Fleur, are you there? FLEUR ( behind dressing door): Daddy, just sit down. I'll be out in a minute. I think you'll love it. What do you think? The neckline's rather low. It is the fashion, sir. SOAMES: The fashion. And is it the fashion to have beggars in the streets and women riding astride down the row? There's nothing wrong with riding astride. In my book, there's a great deal wrong with it. Gentlemen used to ride in Hyde Park in cavalry seats and white top hats. The war's changed everything. It's all right, Daddy. And as for girls like her, with short skirts and common airs... Don't you like the dress? Because if you don't, I shan't wear it. I worry about you. There's no need. The parties all night, up until dawn... I'm quite capable of looking after myself. I'm not going to do anything silly. These parties are just playing, doing what's required. Yours won't be. Mine has a fighting chance because you're organizing it. Are you lunching with anyone? Hmm... no. Let's go to Fortnums and eat cake. But who are they? JON: Can't you see, Dad? It's Cupid and Psyche, of course. Of course. Thank you, Jon. Vospovitch is an innovator. He escaped from Russia in 1916. Bring them in, Jon. One, two, three. JUNE: Careful. She's not paying me, you know. A bit to your left. Perfect. JON: I know it's the new thing, but... oh, Crikey. The... the... the great lovers of mythology, and this is how he represents them. People are bored with sentiment. Love has been bombed to smithereens. What does it mean anymore? Everything. It still means everything. ( engines humming, horns honking ) DRIVER: For goodness' sake, let's move on. ( honks horn ) ( bell rings ) Jolyon. Charles. CHARLES: You didn't walk? Mm-hmm, traffic seems to have doubled since the war. How's Irene? She's well. And Jon? Just down from school. Doesn't know what he wants to do, like all of us were at that age. ( exhales ) ( chuckling ) So... palpitations, you say. If I exert myself. Where? And are they happening now? I feel like the blessed thing is trying to jump out of my chest. Let's check you over, shall we? CHARLES: You were right to come and see me. Your pulse is fluttering, but I'm most concerned about your blood pressure. It's high? Very. I can give you some pills, but... But what? I'm afraid you're in a bad way, old chap. You must look after yourself. Change your routine. No physical exertion whatsoever. And I want to see you regularly, of course. Proper diet is essential. Irene should read up on it. I can't tell her. You must. ( jazzy melody playing on piano ) Okay, let's do something a bit slower. Woo! ( chuckles ) ( ladies giggling ) Woo! ( music ends ) Well done. ( chuckling ) Bravo! JON: Thank you, thank you. Oh, Jolyon! Dad! Hello, Holly. No, don't tell me. Now you're going to be a jazz pianist. There are worse things-- working in June's gallery, for one. IRENE: What was it like? Oh, it's the future, God help her. ( Jon strikes chord ) Well, I hope you were nice, Dad. The gallery means an awful lot to June. I was honest. Ah, well, we have been concocting a plan. JON: Yes. I am going to be a farmer. ( amused ): Uh-huh. Lord. Arable farm near our new place-- chap called Maple. Needs extra hands for the harvest. ( chuckles ) Keep you out of trouble, I suppose. Get me away from you a lot, I suppose. The sooner the better. ( group laughs ) Well, don't stop dancing. ( man heard in distance ) MAN: Lots 24 and 63 have been withdrawn. I hope you will all bid generously on behalf of this worthy charity. And without further ado, let us now proceed to lot one. It's just started. Thank you. AUCTIONEER: A pair of lovely Derby figurines donated by Lady Heath in memory of Captain John Heath, lost at Flanders, and Philip William Heath, lost at the Somme. AUCTIONEER: Lot 429. A copy of Degas' Girl at the Milliners. Who will give me ?20 for Mrs. Lewisham's generous offering? ?20 anywhere? ?20, gentleman in the Homburg. Twenty-five. 25, gentleman at the top table. Thirty pounds? ?30 bid. Thirty-five? Thirty-five. Forty pounds? ?40 to the Homburg. Fifty pounds. AUCTIONEER: ?50, new bidder. We have ?50, ladies and gentlemen. And may I remind you that every shilling made tonight is going to the war widows. Fifty-five. Fifty-five! Seventy. Seventy pounds. Eighty. Eighty pounds. One hundred. A hundred. We have ?100. ( crowd applauds ) AUCTIONEER: Well, was that your final offer, sir? Mm-hmm. Then I'm selling it. Sold, ?100. ( crowd applauding ) ( crowd actively conversing ) MAN: Excuse me. She looks like a minx. She looks like my daughter. By Jove, what a face. Degas-- remarkable, even though it's a copy. Michael Mont. Soames Forsyte. Why did you want her? The life in her. I have, uh, an original Degas, if you'd like to see that, and a few others you might recognize. That's awfully kind of you, sir. I'll drop in like a bird. Anything modern? Expressionism is not my thing. But you're a collector. AUCTIONEER: We now have a figure for the total amount raised this evening. Um, Mr. Mont, if you could come forward, please. There's a new gallery just opened on Cork Street. Meant to be very rum. You should sniff it out. A warm hand, please, for the man who's organized this whole event. ( crowd applauding ) WOMAN: Captain Michael Mont was my son's officer. He was there when David... died. My family would like to thank him for his friendship to my son, and his compassion to us. Thank you... so much. Anything for you. ( "Haba?era" from Carmen playing ) FLEUR: No one can guess who I am, Daddy. ( music continues ) Come on, it's obvious. * Si je t'aime * Mercury... messenger to the gods, * Prends garde... * volatile, lighthearted and rather mischievous. MAN: Well done, Soames. Shall we go through? The boring Surrey lot-- where does Mother find them? * Je t'aime * * Si je t'aime, prends garde ? toi * * Prends garde ? toi * * Si tu ne m'aimes pas, si tu ne m'aimes pas, je t'aime* Are you joining us, Fleur, or would you prefer the nursery? * Si je t'aime * * Si je t'aime, prends... * Fleur. * Garde ? toi! * ( aria concludes ) Your friends enjoyed themselves. I want to put Fleur over my knee. It was a joke. She's capricious. A little restive, perhaps. She and I will go to London and take in some galleries. You're ruining her, and you can't even see it. She needs someone to say no to her. You could influence her if you wanted to... If you had the strength. New dress? Expensive, I suppose. Shockingly. It's too low here. ( door closes ) VAL: That's the one-- number three-- the mayfly filly. Can I ride out while I'm staying with you? You'll be too busy working. Oh, come on. Maybe at the weekends. ( horse neighs ) Val! Oh, Lord, what's he doing here? Hello, Dad. Hello, old boy. ( chuckles ) You know your old cousin, George. Of course. George. Val. DARTIE: And, uh, this is a friend of mine, Prosper Profond. He's over from Belgium. My son, Val Dartie, back from foreign climes. Ah, how do you do? How do you do? And this is Jon-- Jon Forsyte. Nice to see you. Good Lord. Goodness me. Young Jon. Hello. I hear you are a stud farmer, Mr. Dartie. You found yourself some land over here. Are you buying, Mr. Profond? Oh, I'm always buying. And you? If I can afford it. Number three, a small thing, but fine, huh? That's what I thought. I might bid. None of these worth wasting lunch over. Oh, I have yet to find something that is. ( group chuckles ) Would you excuse me? It works better if you look at it from this angle. I haven't seen you in years. Not since before the war. I read about St. John's son-- terrible. Fortunately, most of the Forsytes were spared-- too old or too young. A blessing. Mmm. It's Cupid and Psyche. You can see their faces, kissing. ( snorts ) What stuff! A lamppost in collision with an omnibus. A vision of the future. You've invested in this? It's my gallery. I thought you knew. It must be making a dead loss. ( sighs quietly ) I heard you collect art. Indeed. You obviously don't understand it. For you it's about possession-- buying and selling. It always has been. Soames Forsyte... the greatest grocer of them all. There are some things you can't buy, Soames. Remember? You still haven't learned. Excuse me. JON: This is by Paul Post, Mum. It's good, isn't it? IRENE ( sighs ): It's interesting. ( Jon chuckles ) JON: This is him, too. Daddy? What an extraordinary gallery! We're leaving. But I've just arrived... and it's all so jolly. Fleur. I feel unwell. SOAMES: Fleur. ( quietly ): Fleur. Tomato blobs, or is it a sunset? Airplanes, coming in to land, apparent... ly. Let's go and find June. IRENE: Jon. We have to go. Fleur! Soames... Do we know him from somewhere? I need some air. Wait. Is this yours? F. F.-- Fleur Forsyte. It's mine, all right. Forsyte. Why, that's my name, too. Perhaps we're cousins. FLEUR: Yes. That day in the garden. Cousins-- distant, perhaps. My name's Jolyon, sir. Jon for short. Ah, yes, distant. Very good. Good-bye. FLEUR: Who are they? I mean, you know them? Not well. Are they family? Your grandfather and his brother had a quarrel. We don't... know that side of the family. Ooh, a feud. How romantic! If you want to please me, you'll put these people out of your head. Poor daddy-- you're upset. We'll talk about this later. We will not! I'm not your daughter for nothing, my dear. If I want something, I generally get it, so if you won't tell me, I shall find it out another way. ( giggling ) Oh! Hollywood! ( laughing ) ( knocking at door ) ( laughing ) It really is quite important that I speak to her. But she's entertaining. FLEUR: I'm sure she won't mind. MAID: Miss Fleur! Miss Fleur. My goodness! It's from Paris. ( giggling ) Prosper, my niece, Fleur. Ah, mademoiselle, enchant?. Your aunt says she's never been to Paris, so I bring Paris to her. I'm far too old for this. Sacril?ge! In France, no one is too old. ( Winifred laughing ) We're just about to have lunch. Please stay. It was a quick call, actually. I met someone this morning-- Jon Forsyte. Do you know him? A distant cousin. How distant? Oh, we don't keep in touch. ( chuckles ) His mother was beautiful. Oh. Well, I... I never really knew her. Lunch is ready, ma'am. Oh, thank you, Dora. Now, where is Monty? Are you sure you won't eat, Fleur? No, thank you. Jon Forsyte-- young... My age. I met him with your Val. A splendid boy. Then you must know them. ( stammers ) Let's go in... We had an encounter today. JOLYON: Mmm? With whom? Soames. Oh, my darling. It must have been awful for you. ( kisses ) All of these years later, and he can still make my skin crawl. FLEUR: Oh, Daddy! It's beautiful. I'm glad you like it. I love it. There, now you're ready. Happy birthday. Thank you. Superb! Is cousin Val coming tonight? I believe so. With Winifred and Dartie. Why? We haven't seen him in ever so long. He's been abroad. Wasn't it more than that? He married someone-- the daughter of a cousin Daddy doesn't like. It's complicated. Forsyte history. One more thing. Hurry up, Fleur! You'll be late. Terrific of you to invite me, sir. You're early. My daughter's not yet down. Oh, I say, there's the picture! Well, she's in good company-- Gauguin. What a marvelous house. ( giggles ) FLEUR: Were you in the war, Mr. Mont? Yes, I was. How riveting! Did you have a terrible time? Yes, I did. This party is a bore, isn't it? Not from where I'm standing. Are you going to dance? May I bag a spot on your list? FLEUR: There's my cousin Val with his wife Holly. Excuse me. First dance, my dear? Oh, Daddy, of course. ( orchestra begins waltz ) One moment, please. Winifred. Thank you so much for persuading Soames to invite Val and Holly. I so want everyone to get on. It's the least I could do. Oh, this is Prosper Profond. Shall we? Prosper's got immaculate manners-- dancing with the hostess. It's only right and proper. ( music ends ) ( applause ) You're a good dancer, Daddy. You should do it more often. Have fun. Happy birthday. There's Aunt Winifred's beau! ( grunts ) Monsieur Profond, this is my husband, Soames... Nice to meet you. And my daughter, Fleur. We've met. Exactement. Are you here on business, Mr. Profond? Pleasure. Mr. Profond made money in the war, Soames-- shares in armaments. He tells me he likes to give it away. ( Annette laughing ) I'm always making money. I want little for myself. I... I like my friends to have it. ( Annette and Profond laughing) WINIFRED: Excuse me. Soames. Val and Holly. Very nice to see you again. Charming. Val. Good to see you, Uncle Soames. Would you excuse us for a moment? You could at least try... for Winifred's sake. They should never have come back from South Africa. And as for that other chap... ANNETTE: Profond. I can't abide foreigners. Then why did you marry one? ( orchestra plays dance music) PROFOND: So this is Mrs. Dartie. Oh, charmed, I am sure. Do you know anything about Jon Forsyte? I'm sorry to come out with it like this, but you're my last hope. Everyone round here's been so buttoned-up. He's coming to stay with us next week. With you...? He's Holly's half brother. I know nothing! Uh... it's best not to bring these things up. Bring what things up? HOLLY: Fleur. How you've grown! We haven't seen you in so long. Wouldn't it be jolly if we could be friends? Cousin Val says I can come and stay at your new farm. Maybe later in the summer. I thought next week. Well, it's rather difficult. Aunt Winifred, Val and Holly have invited me to stay next week. Isn't that sporting of them? What a lovely idea! MONT: Miss Forsyte, please, please, will you dance with me? ( chuckles ) Excuse me. Excuse me. HOLLY: What are we going to do about Jon? It was almost as if Fleur knew he was coming. She asked me outright. Took me by surprise. Val! They can't have met. I don't see how. VAL: She is a dazzler. ( cars chugging ) ( honks horn ) Good night. ( horn honks ) Good night. FLEUR: A lovely party. Thank you! It's put some color into your cheeks. I danced all night. With Michael Mont. And others. Good night, my love. Cousin Val's asked me down to stay. But we don't see them. He has wonderful horses and he says I can ride out with him. Fleur. It's only a few days. Please, Daddy? Well... ( sighs ) If it keeps you out of trouble. Night, night. Night, Daddy. ( horse neighing ) We're pretty basic round here. I hope you don't mind. Of course not. Sorry Val's not here to greet you. He's exercising a new horse. He must be very busy. He is. I'm afraid you'll be fearfully bored. Not at all. I'm here to get to know you, remember? Mmm. So it's just the two of you here? Who else would there be? ( hoofbeats approaching ) JON: Holly! I left my book upstairs in my bedroom. This is Jon, my little brother. Fleur's a cousin of ours, Jon. How do you do? I hotfooted it back here on my lunch break. I have to go. From where? Maple's farm. We're harvesting. The book, then? Hmm? Oh, right-- book. ( softly ): Right. ( clock ticking ) ( utensil scrapes, clatters in nearby room ) ( footsteps ) ( clattering continues ) What are you doing? It's such a glorious morning, I thought I'd get out. You don't know the countryside round here. Shall I take the dog? No! Thank you. I might be gone all day, so please don't worry. ( door latch opens ) Where are you going? Good-bye! ( dog barking, birds chirping) Excuse me. I'm looking for Maple Farm. It's up there on the left. Thank you. A couple of miles yet. ( man shouts ) Turn off! Come down and have your dinner. ( gasps ) Oh, blast. Oh, blast. ( clears her throat ) I'm looking for Jon Forsyte. ( to herself ): If he's not here, I'll... ( men mumbling approvingly ) Go on there, boy. Go on. Yeah, go on, say hello. MAN: Go on, Jon. Hello. I... thought you might like some sandwiches, but I see you've already eaten. Thanks, but I think I'll pass. They got mucked up on the way here. So did my lovely new shoes. I-I-I thought it would be nice, but it's such a long way and I forgot to bring anything to drink... I'm very glad that you came. ( men cheering ) Why do I always end up covered in mud whenever I'm anywhere near you? FOREMAN: Come on there, lads. Thank you very much. Haven't I been clever tracking you down? Ever since that day at Aunt Hester's, I've always wondered, who was he? And why was everyone so furious? And then, in the gallery, wasn't it awkward? Father nearly passed out. I've found out why. There's a feud between our families. That's why I pretended we hadn't met yesterday. Are you a good liar? Not very. Oh. They don't mean us to be friends, you see, so if we want to be... Which we do. Then we must keep it a secret. Come on, let's talk about this on the way home. There's a quicker route, as the crow flies. I've told them-- I'll walk you. All right. So... you're going to be a farmer? Maybe. I like the work, the people. Of course, farming's not the grand thing, but... I don't really care about that. Smell. "Jon, Jon, the farmer's son, Stole a pig and away he run." ( giggles ) ( giggling ) Faster. Val's place is just over that hill. Then I'll go on alone. They mustn't see us together. That's ridiculous! You don't know my father. I'm an only child. And so are you. There's so much expected of us. My mother would never stop me from doing anything that made me happy. I'm sure your father's the same. Now, come on. What are you doing? Coming with you. Well... don't walk so fast, then. I can't keep up. FLEUR: Should we? You know, the boys a couple of years on from me at school talked about what they were going to do, the girls they were going to meet. And then they joined up. It's a beastly thing. They died so young. I want to try everything, live forever. Love everybody? That would be telling. Stay on here. All right, then, I will.
