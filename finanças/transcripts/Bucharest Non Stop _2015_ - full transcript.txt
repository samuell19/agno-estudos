BUCHAREST NONSTOP I don't love you anymore. I never want to see you again. Fuck off, dirtbag. Here, boy! Here! I'm going to feed the dogs. Come to mama, boys! Yes, mother. Didn't I say I'd come tonight? Don't make me swear. OK. I understood... I can't talk, I'm packing. Bye now. I couldn't find cables. So now what? I'll take out the battery. Why not ask the taxi guy for cables? You ask. Come on. Excuse me. Do you have cables? - Are you sure it's the battery? - I think so. Turn the key. Hello! How are you, sugar? How's my baby? Yes, handsome. I love you too. Yes, baby. Tell me... Yes, baby. I'm coming home. Tonight! You'll go to sleep and find me there in the morning! I'll wake you up. Yes, baby! Sure I got you something, sugar. No, baby, it's not a Panda! Go to sleep now, honey. Yes, dearest. I love you too, baby! Bye! I'm on my way. I can't sorry. OK, just the girdle. OK, bye! It's the battery. I told you. Can we borrow your cables? - That's no good. - Why? It's the alternator. Better get a battery. My client's here. What are you doing? Are you moving out? Weren't you going to work? A client, right. Please, give us the cables. I can't. My client's here! Maybe it'll work, though. Come on, Marian, help them. I know them. You'll get the cables from Achim. - Who's Achim? - The guy at the store. That's his name? Hold this. Leave them with him. I need them too. Swear to God. Thanks so much! - Thanks so much! - Cheers! Who's the hottie? I don't know. I think she lives in my building. In your building, and you don't know her? I can't, Jeni. Call me later. I'll give you a ride now. - Then we'll see. - OK! - What time's your train? - 10. We'll talk. What was the name of that guy? To get my cables back... - Achim? - Achim. Achim, right. Good guy! - How do you know? - I know him. I love you so much... We'll wake everybody up! I have to charge the battery. Right. I'll go get the cables again. A guy. It's my friend's car. A wreck. What can I do? I've got no money. I said I'd take care of it! Tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow. Yeah, we'll go. We'll go to the mall and get you that thing. I love you too! Bye now! I don't know anybody in Bucharest. But to fuck him... I was just kidding. Did you tell Giani? What's Giani got to do with me? You've got nothing to do with Giani? I just pay him half, that's all. Forget about Giani. The guys I gave my cables. How do you know them? I just do. And? Nothing? You think everybody's... Think they've got money for that? Those losers? How do you know them? I lived in the same building with one of them. Lived? Are you moving out? Aren't you a curious one? Do you like what you do? How's that your business? Do you like what you do? - Yes. - Good. I like it too. I love it. He went away, thought it over and realized he was wrong. Yeah, let's have him do a real comparison. Let him fuck the whole block! Yeah, that irony really touched me. Am I going crazy? He's like an uber-fuck. Screws anything on legs. - He cheated on me! - He admitted it! So he's half forgiven. We're interested in the other half. And he didn't admit it, either. Better it happened now rather than later. It's OK... We're fine. What a treat. Not to be missed. The ice-cream! It must be soggy by now. I'll put it in the freezer. I like it soggy. My teeth won't hurt. If it's soggy it goes right to the abs and thighs. He didn't even pick up his phone for a month! Coward... didn't even dare tell me. It's like he's not right in the head! Well, you too were supposed to go to the seaside with him and went with that jerk to Sinaia! The poor moron was waiting to get laid, got screwed instead. We weren't even together for real. I was undecided. When in need be undecided. Virgil was a cool guy. This is a redneck. And why go to the seaside anyway? Isn't he tanned enough? I heard you, bitches! It's not like he's Swedish! So, are you going to drive this time? - I don't think it's OK. - Why not? Well, it's in your dad's name. If anything happens, I don't want trouble. And I've never driven a Dacia before. - I haven't either! - You drove the old one! I'm not driving this deathtrap. It's the last time I'm driving. Word of honor! He might have sold it cheaper. He would have, if I'd paid him on the spot. We would, afterwards. Just as good. We're paying as much as for the other one. - That one wouldn't even start! - Like this one did. It did. He paid 100 to have the restrictor cleaned. He could have sold it for scrap iron. No way! You know why he didn't? No one's looking for scrap iron. We paid more than enough. You just take care. If you hadn't crashed the last one, we'd still have it. Easy. Just enough to bump it, not to pay for the tow truck. Why don't you drive, if you're so smart? Wasn't last time supposed to be real? Didn't I hit my head without my seatbelt on? - Don't get so fucking warped. - Fuck off! - I'm not driving this piece of shit! - I'm not, either. I won't drive it, you won't drive it. - So? - So nothing. What a douche. That's why I love you. We'll be ok. Hey guys! Can I have the intercom code? Where are you going? My girlfriend Dora, second floor. - Family name? - No family. Just Dora, second floor. - What are you, a detective? - The codes 4869. I'm on third floor, apartment 32, so I dial 486932. Four... eight... six... nine. Fucking C! You'll wait for me, right? You know it doesn't pay to keep the engine rolling. Without that bag, I could take a client and come back. It's in the trunk anyway, what's it to you? What if I get an airport call? The hell you will! It's gonna be half an hour tops. You'll wait, right? OK, but after half an hour you pay me double! Yeah OK, I'll pay you double. Hello! Giani, hi, man! It's Marian, the taxi guy who drives Jeni around. Louder! Quiet here. Quiet! Right. I called because I think... Jeni is planning to scram. Which Jeni? Right, so? She had a big bag and asked me to take her to the station. What? Bitch shut your mouth! Can't you see I'm on the phone? And did you drive her there? No, she's just gone up to a client. Well done. Where are you? Where uptown? Be more specific. Take the baby away. Give me a reference point. Near the Italian restaurant, nearby the park. What if I get a call... Do you want that to be the last call you ever take? Keep her there. I'm coming for her. OK, OK. Come along. Not you. You. Don't tell her I told you, OK? I called because you did me a solid, so... Nothing to do with you, chill. Fucking fuck. Your problem is being so subservient. The moment someone loves you, you're his bitch. No wonder they love you. You're gorgeous. Monica Belluci! And she is gorgeous as a petite. I'm gorgeous in the slender type. Is someone throwing pebbles at our window? It's the third floor. It's screwing with my ears. - It's him. - Sweet! He's standing there throwing pebbles at the window! They're all pigs. I'll throw boiling water at him. And I'll close the window. It's him. - Pick up! - Don't pick up. Dorica! Come here! Hey, doggie! Here! You too, boy. That's right. Fuck off! Ma'am! Could you please buzz me in? Punch the code in. I forgot it, ma'am. No code, no getting in. - Please, ma'am! - Phone them! Come on ma'am, buzz me in. Fucking hag! Ma'am, please buzz me in! Fuck, I think I gave him the wrong code. I just do it by heart. One, two three, like this. See you don't run into him tomorrow! So? Fuck, why doesn't he know the code? He can blow me. I think he tricked you. Noticed the way he looked? How's that? You gave him the code. Tomorrow you might come back to an empty apartment. That would suck ass. Why didn't you just give him the keys? Save him the trouble of breaking down the door. Man. We play tricks on some, and others play tricks on us. I mean, on you. It's a fucking jungle! Law of compensation! So what's he going to take? My dad's pension? I don't care. I'm going away. Does your dad know you're leaving? Sure he does. Is he OK with it? The hell he is. He thinks I should give it up, that she must have found someone else there! - What if she has? - She hasn't. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'll get the money and take her to England. Where's she staying now? You said she was looking after an old hag who died? She did. - She's dead, right? - Right. She moved in with a girlfriend. - A girlfriend with a dick. - Man, you're a douche. - Fucking sleazeball. - Say you love her, man. Fucking say it. Yeah, man, I love her. What if I do? You and... Romeo and what's her name... What's your mother's name? Who's there? It's you... Why don't you answer when I call? Who did you think it'd be? My mother? And if you heard the door close, didn't you hear the key in the lock? Five minutes ago I told you.. I'd go downstairs to feed the dogs. Who do you think it was? Why didn't you tell me? Didn't I? I told you I was going downstairs to feed the dogs? When you don't want to hear, you pretend to be asleep. You expected a note from me? Stop yelling. I heard the key in the lock and I freaked out. Who did you think it was? No one's got the key. We've got no one! That's what I'm saying. We're as lonely as two broken toys. If we die... no one has the key. They'll break down the door just to bury us. We've just had it changed! That's what you care about. That they'll break down the door. Maybe you'll get an invoice in heaven, by fax. You might have a heart attack when you see the cost of a lock! We'd better take someone in to look after us, leave them the house. Why? Where, in these two rooms? I would sleep in the hallway. Not to live here. Just to come in and look after us. How long will you be able to get around? We're all alone here. We'll starve to death! You fought with the neighbors over your stray dogs. Those that bit the Japanese tourist. No one will be here to feed us. So what should I do? Let them kill my dogs? It's not like they all bit him. Just one! How do they know it was our dog. and not one from next door? And after all what was the Japanese doing in Romania? Maybe he had some business in Romania. In Bucharest. Right on our street. He had an itch to come here. He deserved it! Jeez, woman. That man died! Does that mean they should kill all my dogs? Find the one that bit him, and kill that one. What was that? - What? - What's that noise? Nothing. Don't you hear it? Outside the window! I don't hear anything. They should have a poll on TV. Do you think it was a dog from entrance A or entrance B? Now you can hear! What's that? - Cheers! - Hey. A pack of cigarettes. Superlight. - Is this OK? - Yeah. Anything else? A pack of gum. Professional or super-white? - Which one's cheaper? - Same price. Those. Whatever! Professional. Got 3 lei in change? - No. - Me neither. Can I get you a cake instead? Instant coffee? A condom? It's OK, thanks. No problem. Thanks! - I need a favor. - What? Do you have a Nokia charger? What kind? - Nokia. - Nokia, but what kind? What? For a Nokia phone! There are several kinds. A thin jack, a thicker one... - This is the phone. - This piece of junk? You need a thick jack! I haven't got that. Anything else? What, are you checking my phone? You got me wrong. I was going to ask you to borrow it. - Get lost. - I had a fight with my girl. Fucking asshole. My phone battery is dead... Please... I forgot the intercom code. I mean I forgot it... Why do you think it's gonna be better near a restaurant? Listen. There's a lot of money there. We might get lucky and come across a boozed-up moron. We'll make a ton of money. First, we'll go to Di Darius. If it's a no-go, then Acvatic. You can't see inside. Let's do the intersection! It was OK last time! And we need to be both in the car. Remember how that guy wanted to beat me up. What can I do alone? Are you deaf? There's more money this way. Which we split halfway, but I do all the work. I drive, I do the work, thanks for nothing. There's just more money this way. - You don't get it... - OK... Shut it. Not even half an hour. Why do you sit in the backseat? I need to change for the train trip. This is for you! It's too much! The waiting's 20 lei, tops. - There's no need... - Take it! It's OK, keep it. Best of luck! This is my lucky day. Have a drink on me off-shift. Take these, too. What should I do with them? I don't know. Give them to a chick. Got a chick? - Do you? - Yeah, I do. Give them to her, then. What are you looking at? Come on, Marian... Haven't you seen pussy before? - Haven't you? - Come on, Jeni! If I'd known, I'd give it to you for free. Jeni! Come on, don't be like that. I'm in a hurry now. If I weren't... I'm sorry I'm in a hurry. Shall we go? Tell me which way to take. To the train station. I don't know. Train station... OK. What the... Fucking shit. - What's wrong? - My battery died. And you made me give my cables away. Call me another cab. Marian! I'm in a hurry! I'll charge it just a bit. The hell you are. Call me a cab! I'm driving you, OK? Help us out? Get real. Those who take care of you are in fact looking to take your house. They have you sign papers, then blow up a firecracker so you'd have a heart attack. Remember Mrs. Marinescu? The staircase rattled! Didn't you say, if you were to die before me there'd be no one to light a candle for you? Didn't you say that every single day? On and on... And no one blew a firecracker on her. She was nuts. She threw the Tupperware at them. They came everyday to bring her food, and she'd keep them on the doorstep. The hell they came. How do you know? You've been bed-ridden for four years. You told me! You said Mrs. Marinescu was lucky to have those two kids bringing her food every day. They couldn't come into the building because of your straydogs. They were knocking over their Tupperware. That was in the beginning. Mrs. Marinescu told me after that they'd only bring her potato stew. Potato stew until there was no potato stew anymore. No wonder the dogs left them alone. They couldn't smell the meat. Meat or no meat, they came every day. Do I have meat every day? Maybe you do, wherever you go all day long. I'm as good as alone. It's been like this since I was in the army. Not again! I won't remind you that I didn't decide on my own to have that abortion. You forced me. Don't start it again. We said a million times we'd never bring it up again. I'm this close to death and you've pestered me for 45 years with this! Did I start this fight? Today, I didn't say anything... You told me I should have left a note when I went to feed the dogs. And why didn?t I wake you up? And why don't we bring someone to take care for us, since we're alone. No wonder we're alone. You drove me mad with your jealousy! And you forced me to have that abortion because you weren't sure it was your baby. So we're alone. You were gone for months. Some officer! That's why you married me. I was an officer. Serving wherever my country needed me. And sending you the paycheck. No wonder you were bored and wasted your time playing rummy with that dyed-up Mrs. Groza. That's where you met that punk, too. I should have gotten a divorce then. I was so ready to divorce you. Your mother objected. "What would the neighbors say?" Like I'd married the neighbors. The neighbors were to envy her for such a nice daughter-in-law. Nice. I was her punching bag. I shouldn't have agreed to live with your mother. She made you think it wasn't your child. Just put my SIM card into your phone. It costs nothing. No phone. Get lost, you're scaring customers away. What customers? There's nobody here... Please! It costs nothing, I'll use my SIM card! I'll give you my phone. Some phone! Just stand by the door. Someone's bound to come out. You think I didn't try that? A guy came out and asked where I was going. Dora, I said. - Who? - Dora. I don't know her. Then an old hag came out to feed the dogs. I know her. Mrs. Anton, the building commissioner. No one comes in without her knowing. Fucking douchebag. What are you doing? What's the hurry? What happened? I think I'm running out of gas. Didn't you put some gas? Just 30 lei's worth. I kept it running to charge the battery. Why did you keep it running 'till now? What if it stops just when I'm supposed to leave? You should have spent 50 lei on gas. Why not 50? I didn't have 50, you moron. Jerk-off. You drive and I'll keep watch, how's that? Oh, really? I'll put up a reserve fund so we don't run out again. What money? We spent all of our money. What did you spend it all on? I have no money... I have problems. Fuck off! Please don't talk about my mother like that. She wanted the best for us. How did we come to her again? She's been dead 20 years! God rest her soul. She cooked for you and did your laundry, since you never had a job in your life. You were visiting Mrs. Crazy-Dye all day long. My mother was not your servant! I thought we weren't talking about her anymore. What are you talking about? Now you're singing her praises! Didn't I take her to the doctor? Here and there and everywhere? Let's just finish this. You'll be dead and there'll be... no one to light a candle for me. I can't count on you... in this world... or the next either. Enough. You are wasting your time here. - Go home, charge your phone. - I live in Magurele. - Near the Physics Institute? - Where should I go? I have a cousin working there. He says there are radiations! - Radiations? - Yeah. Ball out from the court. Out. What if she's with someone else? Maybe that's why she won't answer. Thought about that? I'd stand by the door just to see who comes out. I did that once. waited all night and caught her. I slapped the shit out of her. Fucking bitch. She thought I was at a rock concert. Where did she live? - Who? - The chick you slapped. A house. Why? That's easier. You stand outside and see what motherfucker comes out, and bam! There's hundreds in a building. I can't ask all of them where they were. At least if anyone came out! You've got a point there. - Cigarette? - Thanks. So what did you do? Why did you argue? You must have done something. I did. What's the difference if you won't let me use your phone? Have you got an ID on you? - No. - No? No. What's it to you? You want my name? It was good collateral. Are you listening? The douche is leaving. - Now? - Yes, now. Are you sure? Yeah, now. I can't drive if I'm on the phone. I'm putting you on speaker! Make sure you can hear me. Watch out, OK? - Go ahead. - Wait a moment. Tell me... A black Audi, I think. Audi? What color? Black. He left. He's leaving right now. He's climbing into the car. Stand by! - When's he coming? - In a moment. Stand by! I see a car. What car? That's not it. I'll tell you when. It's coming round the corner now. In a few seconds. He is coming in your direction. Take care! I can see him. When I got there he didn't even know me. What's your favorite sex position? What are you doing, Are you blind? - We've got right of way, dick! - I've got right of way. Un-fucking-believable. - What fucking right of way! - The fucking right of way! - I've got right of way! - You're a fucking idiot, man. - What are you doing? - Blood. - Is the leather stained? - I've got a concussion. - Is the leather stained? - My head... - Let me see. - No. You've got paper tissues in there. Let me. Unbelievable, what a moron. Let's go. It's not stopping. I'm taking her to the hospital and we'll go to the police tomorrow. - Got insurance? - It's dad's car. Maybe he does. I say we go to the police now so I can have the papers done. - Are we going already? - What police? Fuck them. I'll give you money to fix this piece of shit. How much is the wing? My dad will kill me. I say we call the cops. Let's go, please. Or at least let me sit in the car. - Patience! - I'm not feeling well. Listen. Let's work it out. - I'll give you 300 for the wing. - Not interested. If there are no casualties, the cops don't come. I'm still bleeding. Let's go to the police. She's hurt. Why not go to the police? I need the paperwork to fix my car. It's better all around. No need. Wait... Here's another 200 for the car shop. The mechanic won't fix my car without the paperwork. You call the police, I've got no credit on my phone. Why won't you call? Have you been drinking? I haven't! - I'm taking a cab. - Have you been drinking? Are you DUI? Take the money. Please take the money - I'm not interested. - Please take it! It's the third! I thought you'd quit! I'm not sure I'm keeping it. See what he's doing? Calling me every five minutes. So why not answer? You have to talk. Get me an ashtray. If I said it's over, it's over! He went away with her, he can stay gone. Good. I never liked him. Look at people's reaction. At the baptism party, they wouldn't let him in I like him. I think his bad guy act is sexy. Didn't you say looks don't matter if he's a good guy? No sign of him for a month. Some good guy. Now he's calling you non-stop. Why can't you pick up? Why should she? Is she remote-controlled? Now you speak, now you don't. How long did he not answer his phone? A month... And she should pick up now that he wants to talk. Fuck the slimebag. I'm not picking up. I wish I knew what he wanted, though. I don't know who told him that I cried over him for a month. - Not me. - Yeah, I did. I like him so much I can't keep secrets from him. Asshole. She told him! Where the fuck did I tell you to wait? Jeni! Where are you going? I had a client. I didn't ask you what you had. I asked where you were going. I'm going home. I had a client. - Do I look stupid? - No Giani, I just had a client. Marian, tell him, I had a client. I'm going home. Shut the fuck up. Go take that bag out! - What bag? - What bag? Jeni, get back here! Don't make me hit You. Get in! Fucking shit, get the bag out already! Faster! Take the fucking bag out! - Mr. Giani, we didn't agree on that. - What did we agree on? We agreed you'd wait. Take out the bag. Leave the bag in! I'll punch your face in. Get in the car! - If you'd known... - If you'd known, what? I'll fucking punch your lights out, too. What's wrong with you? Fucking Teddy Bear... I got scared, that's why I asked. When I used to go shopping and came back with my grocery bags didn't you ask, "Are you back?" I was there, you could see. Still you asked. What was I to say: "No?" That's what people say when they've got nothing to say. which reminds me... Could you bring me a pillow for m back? I'm heating up. What time does Mrs. Chelba come for my injection? Are you listening to me? Are you asleep? That's so you. You start the fight and want to end it, too. That's no longer married life. - Hello! - Hello. Can I have... I'd like. a sparkling water and cigarettes. Anything to eat? Will you ask or not? If not, we won't do it. And some special ice-cream. I got it. Coming right up. Take this. And this, too. Thanks a lot. How much? Twenty-five. Got five lei? It's ok. Do you prefer flavored? No. Thank you! Good luck! Hey you! Come here. - Me? - Yeah. Come here. What did you say your name was? Teddy. Teodor, but they call me Teddy. Achim. Nice to meet you. Now that we've met, I'll help you. Tell me your chick's name and I'll call her. - For real? - For real. Are you making fun of me? Enough. Tell me the number. 0766459692... Wait. 594... You don't know her number?' And you say you're in love. I have it in my phone. It's not like you know your numbers by heart. Tell me your wife's number let's see. I don't need to know it by heart. I got no wife, sucker. Get it? But I know the numbers I need to know. Tell me one that you know. Are you dumb? I can tell you any number whether I know it by heart or not. You wouldn't know! Take my mom's number. 0723456789. How will you check? Write it down, and I'll look it up in your contacts. Yeah like I'm gonna I've out my phone to check it. - Give me a break. - No, man. You said 0723456789. Right? Now write it down and we'll see if it's under "Mommy", or whatever. I'm messing with you, man. 456789 is just a joke. Tell me her real number. What am I, dumb? Why do you want my mama's number? I don't. I was gonna prove you don't know it by heart. If you're afraid, tell me another number. Of course I'm afraid. Look at your face. What's wrong with my face? You think I'm gonna ask your mama out? Are you picking on my mama? Enough already. - I'm not, man! - And I was going to help you. I'm not picking on your mama! I was gonna prove you don't know your numbers by heart! Listen... I don't think you want to help me. Motherfucking douchebag rocker. You picked on my mama. Get lost. I swear on my mother I wasn't picking on your mother. Only gypsies swear like that. Are you a gypsy? So that's why you're not giving me your phone, 'cause I'm a gypsy? Are you? What if? Have you got something against them? No, but... Are you a xenophobe? A xenophobe? You don't know what that is? Me, a xenophobe! Meaning you don't like gypsies. Who does? Dorica! How can I help you? Did some guys leave some cables here? They said they would. - They did. - Where are they? - Gone. They took them again. - Why? Their battery is dead. They said they'd bring them in later. Man oh man. Never give away your things. Give me a coffee. Make it light. I had three already. - Instant or filter? - Filter Instant gives me heart palpitations. Take this, I'll make another. Two lei. - Excuse me. - Yes? One thing. Can I borrow your phone? I need to call my girlfriend here in the building. We had an argument and now my battery's dead. I forgot the intercom code, too. Why aren't you standing by the door? Go in when someone goes out. - I tried that. - You did? He did. I saw him. That's not it. What is it, then? Why won't you give him your phone? How could I? Look at him! What about him? He's tanned. And it's not from the sun. What if he's tanned? Are you scared? What have you done? Do you bite? Me? I didn't do anything. Come on, please. I'll pay anything. Give it to him, man. You give it to him, if you've got the guts. I would but I've got a client. I called in five minutes. Vacarescu street, entrance A. I just came in for the cables. And coffee. Dora! Dorica! Where can I put this? Here. At night I take the container in. They stole it even with a chain on. Give me a pack of cigarettes. What a thing. About the container? About the phone. Were you afraid he'd steal it? The container? The phone, man. Light up for me. Just a sec. About the phone thing... I'd have given him the phone, but did you see his face? He might be a good boy, but he's a gypsy. Gotta watch your wallet. Even if you know him. Now that you're here I might have given it to him. He was here for an hour. Is he gone? A building full of hoes... You seem to know about it. Are you married? Haven't found anyone worth it. Hoes all over. I picked up Jeni from here earlier on. Jeni from the ground floor? I know her. She asked me to give my cables to those guys. - I know Jeni. - A hoe. A hoe? What are you talking about? A fucking hoe. Lucky she's got a guy looking after her. Giani. You know what she thought of today? Do a couple of clients and leave without paying Giani. Go where? I don't know. She had a fucking big bag. Fuck the hoe. Going away without paying. Wasn't it her money? It was her ass that got it. He had her back against thugs. Giani saved her ass many times. - Do you know this girl well? - He helped her... Do you know why she became a prostitute? Giani used to beat her She had shades on at night to hide the blackened eye. She bought yoghurt from here. Couldn't chew because her jaw was wired up. Did you know Giani took her away from Botosani and now he wants to sell her to some pimp in Spain? Do you know what she's been through? She kept telling me we might not meet again. I thought she was going to Spain, but she was actually running away. Fuck, man. Why didn't she tell me? I'd have given her a ride to the station. Did she get beat up bad? She got beat up some, for sure. How do you mow he beat her up? - How do I know? - How do you know? Tell me, how? A mate told me. He drove her and saw. He radioed me: do you know Jeni... See how you're getting mixed up? Didn't you say you picked her up here? I did, but I drove her to a client, not to the station. Something's fishy. She is a very nice girl. Why is she a hoe. then? It's not like she was aiming for it. Didn't he grab her by force? She feared this Giani. How do you know his name was Giani? From the girls. I drive them around. They told me. So you know him, right? Give me his number, I wanna call him. I'll run him over, the fucking sleazebag. You're shitting your pants over a guy asking to borrow your phone, and now you're picking on Giani? Do you even know who he is? So you know Giani. Give me your phone. He'll fucking punch your lights out. Let's see if you've got his number. You've got a thing about phones! Give me your fucking phone. I think it was you who called Giani. - You fucked up this girl's life. - I've got a client. Are you busy? Did he beat her up badly? Fucking jerk-off. Are you scared?

If you don't want to marry her, why do you insist? I thought it was a serious thing. I'm only helping young people to start a family. Even if they're gypsies. Is she a gypsy too? We're not gypsies, man. Are you calling her or what? So, say it. Dafto, bulandro! Give me a break and call her already. OK. You wanted Dorica, we're calling Dorica.

He's OK. He's next to me, here at the non-stop. His battery's dead, and he asked me to call and ask you to come downstairs cause he doesn't remember the intercom code. He's asking you to go downstairs and give him the intercom code. I never want to see him again. I don't want to talk to him. If he forgot the code, he can't have it. Tell him I never want to talk to him again. If he forgot the code, he can't have it. He forgot it tough luck. She is not giving you the code. Tough luck. - Give it here. Let me talk to her. - Shut up. Do you want me to shut the window? Miss? Please come downstairs and talk to him. He says you should go talk to him. - Should I go? - Don't go.

And she should give me the code. Miss, he's sorry. He apologizes. And please give him the code please. He says he's sorry. See? He's sorry. Why should she forgive him? We decided she wouldn't. What the fuck? He did wrong, he should pay for it. You don't need his apologies. Forgiveness is the greatest virtue. I read that. So what do I do if he's sorry? - Like hell. - He is sorry. Hello! Is he sorry or not? Let me ask him. Are you sorry? Of course I'm sorry. We should talk about it. Shut up, moron. Miss, he says he wants back in so you can make up, and he wants you. - Just say what I tell you. - I want to get her back. Just say what I tell you. I'm sorry Dora.

Didn't we decide we're not having him back? He should promise. She says you should promise. I don't know what, but she's upset. You made her cry. Let me talk to her already. Dora I'm sorry. Dora, I love you so much. I can't hear what she's saying. Tell her I want to apologize. Do you want me to close the window? - He should admit it. - Have him admit it. If he does... I'll see... - Do you admit it? - Admit what? Miss, please don't cry. You made her cry. It's a shame to spill all your tears over nothing. What tears? Tears are not separate, happy tears in one place and sad tears someplace else. - What? - I can't hear. Now they'll all be sad tears. I knocked her over. You get me? - A beer, please. - Inventory. - Isn't this a non-stop? - You heard me! - Can't I... - Get lost. We're closed. Hello? I can't hear him. I'm asking you, please. He deserves a chance.

He's got flowers and asking you to take him back. I don't want flowers. And I don't want a proposal from a non-stop. Go get some flowers, quick. He hasn't got any flowers. You can see him from the 2nd floor. Did he bring snowdrops or what? I'm not blind. He had his hands in his pockets. Give it to me. Let me decide when and how I propose. He says he'll decide when to propose. - You are not helping me with this. - What the hell do you want? That's my business. Let me talk to her. I'm closing the window. He is so nice...

If you don't go, I'll give him the code. Give him the code to your house. - I haven't got a code. - You haven't got a house. You're like her. Collecting losers. She's not alone. - Give it to me. - Cut it out. Are you messing with us? Who's there with you? Mind your own business. What's your deal here? You know what? What do you mean, what's my deal here? Am I wasting time with you here? Fuck this. I'm trying to help, and what do I get? I'm asking you, please marry this girl. It's a shame, the way she's crying for you.

I've cried myself silly the night you said we should take a break. So? I just said you should decide what to do. I was pregnant with you. Hello? I think I ran out of credit. Fucking... Talk it over. Like people in love, right? It was your fault anyway. I asked you to be careful, I had no condoms, and you said you didn't have any either just to show me you weren't seeing any whores. I asked you to go to the non-stop for some, why didn't you? You said they don't sell condoms at the non-stop. I asked you to take care. Man oh man. I said I'd get pregnant. You said water and soap were the best contraceptive. When I came back, you were snoring like a drill press. I said when I was in the bathroom that I wanted a girl who'd look like you. That I loved you, you moron. - Redneck. - The bad boy. Go quick, someone's coming out. I'm not coming. You can't use me and throw me away. And don't come here, either. What flowers did you get me? Hello? Hello? You bastard! Want a Coke? Cold? - Chocolate, too? - No, I don't. Yeah you do. Cheers. Are you back? - I came for the cables. - So you're back. - Give me a Coke. - What kind?

We had scented candles, but they didn't sell well. - Jeez, Colonel! - Yes. - Sorry. I didn't recognize you. - Yeah. You've lost a lot of weight. Is the power down? A candle... Sorry, I really haven't got any. How's Mrs. Antonia? OK? How are the dogs? - She's... - Wait maybe I can help. Colonel... take this flashlight. It's old... for free. - No... - No charge!

This? - They'll steal the engine. He can watch it. - This deathtrap? - Yeah, this deathtrap. You were good, I must admit it. - Take the cables. - Yes boss! You left me alone, you dirtbag. You did well, but I shat my pants when you didn't take the money. - Why? - What if he called the police? He wanted to give me the lei, but then I saw the Euros. And the moron was drunk too. And the insurance doesn't cover it. If you're drunk. Get it? - Still, man. - What? What if he called the police? The money he's got could buy the cops and the car on top of it. - The wedding ring, sucker. - What? He was married. He wasn't going to call anyone. Stop staring at me. Give him the cables. - You're smart. - You can say that again. I got you the cables. Good. The man came for them twice today. He was pretty upset. We'll work it out. Give me the money. Here. Five hundred for me, five hundred for you. How do we split this? - We'll exchange it tomorrow. - I need it now. - Where to exchange it? - Here. He hasn't got it. Don't, man. Sir, could you exchange five hundred Euros for us? Five hundred Euros? What am I, Carrefour? I don't make that kind of money in a week. Wait. How much did you owe me? - Me? - Yeah. - Thirteen hundred. - So. Five hundred? At a rate of four lei. We'll work out the difference. Seven, then. - What difference? What? - Wait. Wait, we're getting confused here. Four lei is too little. For how long you put me off, it's OK. I'll exchange two hundred, but not at a rate of four. Putting me off again? No, and I'll give you the rest afterwards. - Four two OK? - Four two is OK. - I don't like it. - It's OK. - Let me see if I got the money. - What are you talking about? - It's none of your business, man. - It's my money. It comes out of my half. - Where did you get the money? - What's it to you? They're fake! Counterfeit! Fake, how? Are you stupid? Come here. You seem smarter. Look here. Do you see any safety marks here? This is printer-grade paper, man. Are you this fucking stupid? Even my mama could tell. Fucking shit! What did you do? What did you do? Did you take counterfeit money? He was giving you lei. Why didn't you take lei? You think you're smart? Un-fucking-believable! My heart! What do I do now? Fucking kill me already. How do I pay him tonight? Fuck. Here, eat these Euros. You want Euros? Here! - Fuck. - Hold it, man. What are you doing? Where are you going? I'm going to look for a moron like you. So you're leaving me with the car all messed up? Fucking moron! Where are you going with the money? Where did you get the money? It's a serious crime. Got money to go to Spain?
