[MUSIC PLAYING] MARY MARGARET: [INAUDIBLE] I can't. But I told her I was holding Bella's hand with my left hand. So she told me to take it in my right hand. But I told her I was holding Donna's hand with my right hand. So she asked me if I could let go of at least one of my imaginary friend's hands long enough to take the eraser. And I said, of course I couldn't, because that would be rude. But not quite as rude as calling my friends imaginary right in front of their faces. And that's when she made me stand in the hall. That's nice, Daisy. Why do you always call me Daisy? Hmm? Just in case you forgot, my name's Mary Margaret. But you make such a beautiful Daisy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't touch that book, Daisy. That's some very delicate specimens. Belonged to your great grandma Margaret-- famous botanist. [DOORBELL RINGING] Delivery for Mr. Dennis. Oh. Gilbert! Just a moment, gentlemen. Gilbert! Did you call me, honey? SYLVIA: Where's this supposed to go? Is that the mirror? That's what it says in the invoice. Pretty heavy for a mirror. It's an antique. Bring it upstairs, please. I was afraid you were gonna say that. Watch out! You're stepping on Donna! - What? Where? There. - Mary Margaret! - Come on, guys. It's all right. MARY MARGARET: But, dad. [GRUNTING] Where does it go? We don't have space in our room for a big mirror. It can go in Daisy's room. That's what grandma Margaret stated in her will. Go ahead, fellas. - Thanks. Sure. Your welcome, sir. Grandma bequeathed it to you, Daisy. It's beautiful, isn't it? It's a little much don't you think? I like it. It's a remarkable piece of work. All of the plants that are carved into this frame are botanically correct. This is one of my fondest memories at grandma's house. I think I became a botanist because of it. I thought you became a botanist because you flunked your physics entrance exams. Well, not everybody can be as brilliant as you, sweetie. That's true. Oh! I've got to meet Tuttle at the lab. I'll be home for supper. - By, mom. - Bye, sweetie. They don't make mirrors like this anymore. This is handcrafted from start to finish. Well, I have to go to work. Take good care of it, Daisy. What do you think, Bella? Donna? You like it? Me too. [WIND CHIME SOUNDS] WOMAN: Well, I think it's a very nice job. MAN 1: Oh, excellent. WOMAN 1: Look at the detail here. It's excellent. And you painted that yourself? WOMAN 2: That's terrific. MAN 2: Interesting shape. That's a nice choice of color there. WOMAN 2: Oh, I love the blue on this. MAN 1: Fascinating. MAN 2: Well, that's very interesting. Good job. Hm, nice. MAN 2: [INAUDIBLE] it was very imaginative. Very imaginative. WOMAN 2: Oh, I love this. WOMAN 1: How does this work? [CHATTER] Oh, look. That's very funny. Just like her. You've even captured that duck-like squat of hers. Yeah, and her green eye shadow. [LAUGHING] WOMAN: I doubt that Mrs. Mallard will see the humor in this. MAN: Our principal doesn't see the humor in anything. First prize in the sculpture division goes to Mary Margaret Dennis. Congratulations, Mary Margaret. [APPLAUSE] [CLEARING THROAT] I heard all that. Let's just see what everyone finds so funny around here. That does not look like me! I understand your mother is a famous physicist. Yes, sir. She invented a ray for capturing children from other planets. That's where I came from. Really? And what planet is that? They won't tell me. They're afraid I might find my way back and lead and invasion of Earth. Fascinating. And what does your father do? Whatever my mother tells him too. I see. Who are Bella and Donna? Why don't you ask them? They're standing on your desk. [GIGGLING] Is that so? And why did you make that statue of our principal with the body of a duck? Her name is Mrs. Mallard. Go directly to class, you lady. Don't dawdle. MARY MARGARET: Quack, quack, quack, quack. Quack, quack, quack, quack. Well, what is your opinion? Just be glad your name isn't Baboon. I understand that it's supposedly healthy for a child to indulge in fantasy play. But when imaginary friends start causing problems at school-- that is where I draw the line. I'm right. Aren't I Tuttle? Tuttle? I'm right here. What did you say? I said, you agree with me. Don't you, Lazlo? Yes, of course, Sylvia. I quite dislike children. [INAUDIBLE] Even when I was one. When I was a child-- and believe it or not, Tuttle, I played with Barbie dolls-- I didn't have any friends, real or imaginary. But when we win the Nobel Prize, we will have friends all over the world. You're right, Lazlo. I should just let her do her thing. OK. Doppelganger-- ready to fire. [BLARING STATIC SOUND] We've got a hot point. Protoplasmic anti-matter. [ALARM SOUNDING] Dear, god. Too hot! It's too hot. Take it down! We did it. Only for a moment, but we really did it. Yes, we did it! We did it! Yes, we did it! [JOYFUL YELLING] We did it! Mom. Dad. I won first prize in the art contest today. Mom? Dad? Anybody home? Dad? [SNORING] (WHISPERING) Dad? Are you asleep? Tanacetum Vulgare. Podophyllum Peltatum. Melilotus Alba. [WIND WHISPERING] Hey, you guys. Shh. Dad's sleeping. Do you like these berries? I can't take them. Dad would freak. OK. OK. SYLVIA: Gilbert! Gilbert! What are you doing? The Tuttles will be here in less than an hour, and you're napping like a grandpa. OK. OK. No problem. I'm awake. And you, young lady. This is a very important night and I expect you to be on your best behavior. I promise, mom. [MAGICAL TWINKLING SOUND] OK. What are they? Magic or something? [GIGGLING] The way home? What? Mary Margaret. Come on! OK, mom. Bella? Donna? Come back. [GLASS CLINKING] Here's to the culmination of five years of research into the Doppelganger. And to our collaboration, Sylvia. [CLANKING] Sorry. Well, Gilbert. You must be as proud of Sylvia as I am of Lazlo. Yes, I am. But I have to admit I'm not exactly sure what it is they're up to. It's a Doppelganger. Use a parabolic mirror to focus a beam of anti-matter into a pinpoint of matter. Uh-huh. It's a collision of matter and anti-matter opens a hole in a time-space continuum. Now, that sounds a little dangerous. Yes, it is. It's not. It only lasts for a fraction of a second. Well, with geniuses like you and Tuttle working together, I'm sure you'll be able to improve on that soon enough. [LAUGHING] Gilbert's joking of course. Yes, of course. But hopefully it can give us a glimpse into the dimensions that lie beyond ordinary perception. You mean the perception of an ordinary individual such as myself? Gilbert-- You seem a bit hostile tonight, Gilbert. [LAUGHING] I saw something weird in grandma's mirror today. Mary Margaret, the adults are speaking right now. I'm not hostile, Lazlo. Just a little bored. I won first prize in the art contest today for my sculpture of Mrs. Mallard. That's nice, Mary Margaret. But we're discussing mommy's work. Gilbert darling, I'm a little surprised by your negativity. Nora is very impressed, and she has three PhDs. I would think you would be a little more astounded. [MAGICAL TWINKLING SOUND] There. Now drink your tea. [GIGGLING] Oh! Oh! My dress! Oh my goodness, Nora. I'm so sorry. Mary Margaret Dennis, what do you think you're doing? It wasn't me. It was Bella and Donna. I've had it up to here with your imaginary playmates! But, really, it was. You march right up into your room and take a good long look in that mirror, and you tell me if you see any imaginary friends! I'm sorry, Gilbert. But this whole situation is starting to give me nightmares. You have to have an imagination to have nightmares, dear. [FRUSTRATING YELL] First prize! Big deal! They don't care. Nobody cares! [WATER RUSHING] [SNORING] [PLAYFUL MUSIC] [SCREAMING] Who are you? What are you? What are you doing here? What do mean what am I doing here? This is my bedroom. What are you doing in my mirror? But this is my mirror, my room, my responsibility. You are the intruder here. What is this, a dream? No, no, no. I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't. You can't prove a thing. - Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. Be afraid. Be very afraid. This is a disaster. a "ca-ta-tastrophe." End of the world. Not good at all. Calm down. Maybe I could help. Help! How could you possibly help? You're the problem. Why am I the problem? You're a people. So, what's wrong with that? Oh, when Queen Hysop finds a people has breached my mirror-- oh, I'll be planted for sure. Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Peoples can't come through the mirror unless-- say, you don't have any berries do you? Berries? Yes. Little golden berries. N-- no. Then how did you-- ah! Ah! That's not a room. I mean, her room. What happened? Where did she go? Who? The sweet little old lady. The one that's been there all those years and never gave me any trouble? Grandma Margaret? Yes! She died last year. (SADLY) Oh. Oh, dear. How terribly, terribly sad. She passed the mirror on to me. My name's Mary Margaret. I guess I'm you're new owner. Owner? You? Me? Impossible! We don't even occupy the same world. Why am I even talking to you? Well, I'll be planted for sure. We got to find a way to get you back to where you belong. MELILOT: Tansy! Tansy! Oh no. Oh no! That's Melilot. Well, who's Melilot? Oh, oh, oh. My superior. Oh. Oh. The-- the mirror master. Hide! H--hide where? Tansy? The mirror [INAUDIBLE], Tansy. A mirror has been violated! A mirror? Violated? Not here, sir. - What's this? A-- a technical malfunction? - Where are they? - They who? Who, sir? - They who crossed over. - Not here! No, sir. Where is the people? I'm right here you big bully! Ouch! Get off me, Tansy. This is a violation of inspection code four, double eight, two point six. Tansy, do you realize what this means? No. No. No. Let me explain. You see, I was here, not sleeping, when there was-- out of nowhere, a people in my room. Mel, it was terrible! Tansy? Oh, here we go again. Is he hurt? No. He just fainted. We constitution [INAUDIBLE] Three days after my retirement and now this. The biggest disaster in 100 years. I'm sorry. Sorry? That's a peculiar name. Mine's Melilot-- mirror master Melilot. No, my name's Mary Margaret. And I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble. Trouble? No, no, no trouble. Just the end of the world as we know it. Oh, wake up, Tansy, and face the music. Oh. Oh, Mel. Oh, I had the most awful dream. I dreamt that a-- a people came through my mirror. [YELLING] Now, settle down, Tansy. I've got to think how best to handle the situation. Y--y-- yes, sir-- think. [CREAKING] All right. Hey, young people! Stop! You can't go out there. Why not? Regulation 38, paragraph 7. You've got to go back to where you belong. But I don't want to go back. Nobody cares about me there. I want to stay here. Uh-uh. You can't do it without permission from Queen Hysop herself. Then I wish to see the queen. Oh, nice going, blabbermouth. Now we've got to take her-- spectrum code 34.7-- no request for an audience for the queen shall be denied. So be it, Mary Margaret. You want to see the queen, then the queen you shall see. But mark my words, you will live to regret it. So come along. We've got a long and perilous journey ahead. Right. So long, Mel. Good luck, Mary Margaret. Really nice meeting you. Mirror minder Tansy, under spectrum code section 358, I'm required by Her Majesty to take you back for judgment. Oh, I was afraid you'd say that. [YELLING] What's this? Oh, [INAUDIBLE] TANSY: It's Dragora. Who? No, no, no, no! Don't touch it, young people. It's an omen. It's not an omen. It's a caricature. Come along you two. It's getting late, and we have a long way to go. MARY MARGARET: Where do all these doors go to? Each door leads to a mirror room, just like Tansy's. And every mirror has mirror minder. Mirror minder? A guardian to make sure that no one from your world crosses over here. But most importantly that no on from our world crosses over there. But why would any mirror people want to do that? It's so beautiful here. Oh, no, it's not just mirror minders in our world. No, no, no, no, no. There's much more dangerous creatures. (WHISPERING) [INAUDIBLE] [DUCK CALL] What's wrong? Did you hear that, Tansy? Here what? What was that all about? I thought I heard one of them. Them? The drakes, they can't resist answering the call. Drakes? A society of tea-drinking, caffeinated brutes, lead by an unscrupulous witch by the name of Dragora, who claims to be a queen-- in strict violation is speculum code 793. Everybody knows the right true queen of Mirror World is none other than Hysop, queen of plantings. Let's just hope that Dragora hasn't got wind of you. Or you won't be safe anywhere. Why? What do they want with me? You're the people. So? Everybody knows that peoples make the best tea. Tea? Y--y-- you mean they-- Steep them in boiling water for a good 60 seconds. Oh, it's far worse than that, Tansy. Worse than being dipped in boiling water? Dragora will no doubt assume that you have mirror berries, and do everything in her power to get them from you. Thankfully, she doesn't have any mirror berries. - Do you? - N--n--no. I told you I don't. Just the same, I don't think we'd best vest on our laurels. Forward. [DUCKS QUACKING] MIRROR MINDER: Hey. Hey, let me out of here. Let me out of here. Tea, Swanston! Bring me my tea! Just seconds more, your Downiness. MIRROR MINDER: Oh, no! Oh! Somebody help me. Oh! It's getting hot in here. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Mirror minder, steeped 10 seconds. Your favorites, my queen. Ah! It has a funny aftertaste. Feed it to the soldiers. [QUACKING] I grow bored with mirror minders. Bring me some new varieties of tea. Your Downiest Majesty, if I may have a word. Have a tea Admiral Dabble. It's a rich mirror minder. Swanston, serve the Admiral! An excellent, excellent mirror minder. Just a hint of nuttiness. There is a disturbance in the universe. A mirror has been breached. When? An hour ago, you're Quackliness. Where? In the Westies. They'll no doubt be heading for Queen Hysop's Garden. Who? Two mirror minders, and a people child. A people child? We must have her for tea-- steeped 60 seconds. My thoughts precisely. If a people is here, it must have berries. We must find out where it came from. If we can quack through to the people world, we'll have free access to the finest of tea! Billions of people just waiting to be brewed. Like sitting ducks, Majesty. Oh, pardon my metaphor. We must find the people child before it reaches Hysop. We'll take its berries, and steep it for a full minute. A rare treat, Majesty. A plot most foul, Your Quackiness. Mel, you think-- I mean, is it possible that Queen Hysop won't have me planted? Planted? Oh, difficult to say. You know what a stickler she is for the law. Oh, dear. But think on the bright side, Tansy, you failed abysmally as a mirror minder. Perhaps you'll make a wonderful drop. What are you guys talking about? MELILOT: You'll see soon enough. Forward! Well, this looks like a safe place to camp. But we must keep our guard up. Tansy, you take the first watch. Me? Yes. Well, it was your unauthorized napping that got us into this mess in the first place, which makes you the last of us to get any sleep at all. That's true, Tansy. I saw you. I most emphatically was not sleeping! I remember the good old days when mirrors were prized in the people's world. Precious, rare, magical-- now-- now they're made with such cheap materials and shoddy craftsmanship. Mirror minding has practically become an-- a lost art. Why? Because only the fines of old mirrors can be used as doorways between our two worlds. Do you know how crazy this sounds? Oh, really? Well, you're the one who pass through the mirror. Now, stop your babbling before you attract someone-- or somethings-- attention. [SNORING] I'm sorry, Tansy. It's not your fault. Melilot was right. I am an abysmal mirror minder who deserved to be planted. No, you're not. You guarded that mirror for my great grandmother all her life. You did a great job. She never had any problems whatsoever. I'll tell Queen Hysop that myself. Thanks, Mary Margaret, but I don't think it'll do much good. I've brought grave jeopardy into our two worlds. Tansy? Yes? I have a confession to make. I do have berries. Oh! Oh! you do! Oh, fibber, fibber, fibber! Shh, quiet, Tansy, you heard what Melilot said. Oh, fibber, fibber, pants a quiver. I'm sorry, Tansy. I was afraid to tell you because I took them from my father's study, and I was already in so much trouble. Hey! What happened to these three? Oh, the berries are only good for one cross over each. One berry, one trip. After that, [BLOWING RASPBERRIES] they're worthless. But I only crossed over once. Well, that's not possible, unless, of course, somebody came up with you. Oh, dear me. Oh, you'd better tell me who it is. We have to confess everything to Queen Hysop. But I crossed over alone. I swear it. Berries don't fib. People fib. But it's true. I know I fibbed about having them. But I promise I'm telling the truth now. [MAGICAL TWINKLING SOUND] [CHATTER] Watch out, Mary Margaret, they [INAUDIBLE].. Oh, be careful, Mary Margaret. Bella, Donna, you're real. Of course we're real. We're pixies. Thank you for bringing us home, people child. We're forever grateful. Careful, Mary Margaret. They tickle. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] [MAGICAL ZAPPING SOUND] Oh, Tansy, settle down. It wasn't me, Mel. That was the pixies. Balderdash and piffle. Pixies were stuck on the people side eons ago. Tansy! Tansy! You two get to sleep now. I'll keep watch. Excellent idea. [SNORING] Bella? Donna? [QUACKING] There they are. I saw them just an instant before you, Your Quagliness. Excellent reconnaissance, my queen. [WINGS FLAPPING] Tansy! Melilot! There's something out there. Shh. [DUCK CALL] [QUACKING] [FRIGHTENED YELLS] They got us surrounded. Quite right. Our superior forces make it useless to resist. As highest ranking member of our party, I shall take the full brunt of their assault. Run away you two. I've got them well at hand. Come on, people. Come along. Come on, you. Give me your all. Come on. Give me-- Help! Help! Come on, people. Move your skinny butt! Hey, people, wait for me. [QUACKING] Ooh! Ah, Mirror Master Melilot. What a pleasant surprise. Swanston, Dabble, and the fowl, Dragora. I shall make you a most pungent and disagreeable [INAUDIBLE] Shut up! I look forward to it, Mirror Master. But first, where is the people child? Deliver her to me! [HEAVY BREATHING] - Tansy, wait! - What? Are you crazy? We got to keep moving. They're right behind us. We have to save Melilot. You heard him. He specifically ordered us to run. Well, we can't just leave him there. He was so brave. Yes, but that was his job. What if they hurt him? We'll feel really bad. Yes, but if they hurt us, we'll feel pretty bad too. Possibly even worse. Remember, they steep mirror minders for 10 seconds, but people, they steep a good 60 seconds. Nobody's gonna to steep me. I'm going back for him. Oh! Oh, well, all right. But don't blame me peoples when you find yourself bumping in a tea pot. Which mirror did it come from? What is the people's name? And who's the funny looking fellow with her? Now, now, now, you Drakes. You're in violation of speculum code 728.1. Search him for berries. With pleasure, your [INAUDIBLE].. [LAUGHING] Oh my gosh. Poor Melilot. What are they doing to him? Oh, they're tickling him. Tickling him? Is that all? Mirror minders are so ticklish. [LAUGHING] There they are. Chase them! That's odd. I'm quite sure we're not over there. I can see their beady little eyes. Ah! Pixies! Pixies! Don't let them get away! Tansy, come on. Now's our chance. You fools! He's gotten away! Oh! [THUD] Oh, my teeth. Another fine operation, Edward. Mary Margaret? Mary Margaret? I want to talk to you. All right, young lady. If that's they way you want it, you can stay in there until you're ready to apologize. We're still on? I can't believe she's defying me like this. Why is it so important that she give in first? It's the principle, Gilbert. She has to know who's boss. She has to respect my authority. I think she does respect you, Sylvia. Maybe all she's looking for is a little respect in return. Meaning what? Meaning that neither of us have paid much attention to her lately. We've been so wrapped up in our own worlds, it's no wonder she's so wrapped up in hers. She's such a great kid, Sylvia. Maybe we should stop worrying so much about her behavior and start thinking of our own. Go to her, honey. [KNOCKING] Mary Margaret, honey? Open the door. Mommy's not mad anymore. I promise. [KNOCKING] Mary Margaret, please open the door. Mary Margaret? Good heavens, what's she done to the mirror? Gilbert? Gilbert! Gilbert! Unauthorized possession of mirror berries. Transportation and concealment of said berries. Interactive [INAUDIBLE] of a third-party crossing. And finally, disregarding the direct orders of a superior. A total of 12 violations. A most ignominious record if I may say so. We disregarded your orders so we could save you from the Drakes. Nevertheless, a violation is a violation and must be documented and reported. You could at least say thank you. I bet your pardon. Thank you. You're welcome. We must keep moving. Dragora will not give up so easily, and the Drakes will try again. Tansy, you'll have plenty of time to rest in the garden. Forward! Yeah, when I'm sprouting roots and Lima beans. We had them in the palm of our hands, and you let them slip away. Fools! We fought them, Majesty. We fought them hard. There were pixies, Admiral. My elite squadron fell by a pair of newts. Tea! Where is my tea? In a moment, my queen. [CREAKING] MIRROR MINDER: Oh. Oh, no. Help. [INAUDIBLE] Help. Help. It's soothing mirror minder. Here, my Queen. Ah. Ah. Shall I make you a tea, Admiral? Yes, Majesty. Yes. It's been a most stressful day. Bring the people child to me, alive and with berries. Or I shall make you a fine tea, Admiral, steeped a full 24 hours. Yes, I go now to defeat the people, Majesty. [QUACKING] There they are, in the trees. [GRUNT] Ooh! What was that? An egg. How strange. I wonder where it came from. I wonder what kind of bird you suppose could have laid it. Drakes! Mary Margaret, quickly, quickly, quickly. [BOOMING] I love the smell of duck guts in the morning. Oh, my compliments, Admiral. These new smart eggs give us a true tactical age. [QUACKING] Look, there's the statue Mary Margaret made at school. She must be in there. But how is it possible? I don't know. You're the expert on alternate dimensions. Yes, but I never expected to encounter one in my own home. Oh, I've got to call Tuttle. No, don't, honey. That guy's a quack. This is the perfect opportunity to try out the Doppelganger. Grandma had some old poem about this mirror. Something to do with berries. Well, well, well, what have we here? That's mine! Silence people. People is plural. I'm not a people. I'm a person. My name is Mary Margaret. Oh. Yes. At long last, I have berries! [QUACKING] Now, if you would be so kind as to tell us which mirror you came through. That's none of your business, you big ugly duck. I'm not a duck. I'm a Drake. [PAINFUL QUACK] Why you featherless, little-- just for that, you'll be first for tea. [EVIL LAUGHING] It's tea time, my loyal servants. Prepare yourselves for the greatest delicacy-- people tea! And after we've drunk our fill, we'll be off to find the mirror. Steep her, Swanston, a full 60 seconds. With pleasure, your Quackliness. Do something, Melilot. What can I do? I have no authority here. Help! Somebody help me. Shut up. [QUIVERING SOUNDS] Tansy! Melilot! Tansy? Melilot? Dear-- She's tea for certain. MARY MARGARET: Tansy, please. Steep her and be done with it. Oh, poor, poor child. [INAUDIBLE] to be the kind of fate to be bouncing in [INAUDIBLE] MARY MARGARET: Mom? [MAGICAL TWINKLING SOUND] Bella. Donna. I knew you'd come back. You don't need us anymore. So we're going to leave you now. Come on, you guys. I do need you. You're my friends. Good bye, Mary Margaret. You're scaring me. It's getting hot. Don't worry about us, child. We enjoy a nice, hot bath. Tansy, please. Melilot, please help me. [SCREAMING] Oh! Poor Mary Margaret. Poor Mary Margaret. People tea for your approval, Majesty. Hmm-- Problem, you're Quacktitude? Not quite the people tea I remember from my girlhood. But interesting nonetheless. Drink, please, my loyal ones. [QUACKING] What in heaven's name? Mary Margaret was a sweet child. But as a tea, she's a bit intoxicating. No, I'm not. Oh! Mary Margaret! Mary Margaret! You're not [INAUDIBLE] intoxicating. I'm not a tea. My friends saved me. What friends? You don't have any friends but Tansy and me. Melilot claimed it wasn't our duty to save you. I mean the pixies-- Bella and Donna. Bella Donna-- why that's the name of a plant in our world. A very powerful plant. One taste of it and you-- You get knocked out? Yes. How did you know that? Oh, I see-- Well, we must move quickly. The effect won't last long. And Dragora still as the berries. Get your [INAUDIBLE] off my berries! [QUACKING] This is amazing. A once in a lifetime opportunity to test our [INAUDIBLE].. We've been working for. I don't care about that, Tuttle. I just want my daughter back. Yes, yes, of course. But there's nothing wrong with winning the Nobel Prize in the process. Oh, Gilbert, stand back, honey. Something about one berry here. I beg your pardon. Oh, an old poem. I see. Let's get to work here, Tuttle. Maximize the matrix dissolver. Anti-matter the generator 10%. You guys really think this is gonna work? I will stake my reputation on it. Remember, Swanston, our very first cup of people tea. What was that people's name again? Oh, your [INAUDIBLE],, earl grey. Yes, that's it. Queen Hysop's court is this way, isn't it? Excellent navigational skill, Majesty. Don't make any sudden movements. And don't curtsy, just kneel. And wait till your turn to speak. Don't-- don't laugh. Don't smile. Don't frown. And don't defy her. Just be yourself. Approach the throne. Mirror Master Melilot, Your Majesty. What say you, Mirror Master? I regret to report that we have an-- an unfortunate disruption between the two realms. A mirror has been violated? Yes, Your Majesty. And two mirror berries have fallen into the hands of Dragora-- have they not? Well, in a way, Your Majesty. And this people child is responsible I presume? Let me just say that it was my fault. Silence. I have no ear for pathetic excuses. You should have brought this to my attention immediately. We were on our way when-- Silence, people. I'm speaking with Melilot. We'll come to you soon enough. Mirror Master Melilot, you have mishandled this situation from the first moment. Stand aside to await sentencing. Thank you, Your Majesty. QUEEN HYSOP: Mirror Minder Tansy, step up and plead your cause. Y--y--yes, Your Majesty. Could I just say that I was not sleeping. You are a very bad mirror minder. Stand aside for sentencing. Your Majesty, can I just beg for mercy? Silence. Thank you, Your Majesty. Mirror Master Melilot and Mirror Minder Tansy-- through your various indiscretions, you have jeopardized the existence of life in both worlds. I hereby sentence you to planting. [SOBBING] No! I beg your pardon? You can't do that. It's not fair. You didn't even listen to what happened. I don't have to listen to anything. I'm the queen. Well, in my opinion, you're not much better than queen Dragora. Dragora is not a queen. I am the queen. Tansy and Melilot are the bravest, most honorable people I've met here. Tansy and Melilot are not people. You should be glad to have them as your subjects. They disobeyed orders. Without order, there is chaos. Carry out the sentences. Tansy, Tansy, wake up. It's time to be planted. Planted! [SOBBING] The royal watering can. Begin the planting. [MAGICAL TWINKLING SOUND] No. [SOBBING] You're not a queen. You're a monster. Harsh words from someone who has yet to be sentenced. It doesn't matter what I say, does it? You're not listening anyway. You're a spirited little sapling, aren't you? I'm not a sapling. I'm a people. I'll strike a bargain with you. What kind of bargain? If you do as I ask, I shall pardon your friends. OK. What is it? Prevent Dragora from crossing to the people world, and I shall set Melilot and Tansy free. OK. I'll try my best. Run back to the mirror, child. Time is running out. Don't worry, you guys. I'll be back. Mel? I don't like it here. I want to go home. Settle down, Tansy. It's not so bad. It will grow on you. Sylvia, angle the mirror slightly forward. We cannot afford any peripheral reflection. There's something written here. "With one berry, you may pass into the world inside the glass." That's it! "But ask you must before you roam-- If what you seek is found at home." What is it? It's my grandmother's poem she used to recite to me when I was a kid. But what does it mean? Excuse me, Sylvia. But this is no time for poetry. The Doppelganger is reaching full charge. Berries-- that's it. Gilbert, where are you going? Don't do anything until I get back. There she is-- the people child. Wait here, Your Quackliness. I will capture her for you. You featherbrain, leave her alone and she'll lead us to the mirror. Excellent plan, Majesty. Brilliant and well-spoken, Your Downiness. Come on-- Sylvia, projector is ready to fire. Wait one more second for Gilbert. We must not wait. The [INAUDIBLE] is charged. If we don't initiate the anti-matter generator immediately, it could incinerate the entire university. [HEAVY BREATHING] We're approaching the danger zone. Just a moment longer. Stand back, Sylvia. It's now or never. Mary Margaret? Mary Margaret? Mary Margaret! Get out of the way! We're trying to open the portal for you. [GRUNT] Oh, no. Sylvia, get out of the way. Tuttle, turn it off. It could hurt Mary Margaret. It's too late. I have to fire. [MOTOR REVVING] [ELECTRICAL ZAPPING SOUND] Oh, no! Gotcha. Are you crazy? You could have broken the Doppelganger. You could have hurt Mary Margaret. Doppelganger is only way to save your daughter. No it's not. This is. "With one berry you may pass into the world inside the glass." This is the key. You're a fool, Gilbert, to put your faith in nursery rhymes. There's only one berry left. I'm going in for her. No, Gilbert. I'm the one responsible for this. Let me go after her. Nobody touches that mirror. Tuttle, what are you doing? This is a moment of truth-- the chance to prove our theories. We stand on the brink of our greatest time, and you would store it all away for a moment of common emotion? I can't let you do it, Sylvia. I can't. Stand back, or I incinerate the both of you! I always though you were a quack, Tuttle. Now I see you're completely insane. How do you speak to me like that, Gilbert? A small-minded man like you can' be expected to understand the likes of Sylvia and me. Spare me the comparison, Tuttle. You go first, Dabble. Subdue the people, and deliver her to me. Withe pleasure, my fine feathered queen. Stand close to me, Swanston, and prepare to defend your queen. - As you wish, Majesty. - Shh. Come on. You went through the mirror once. Please, do it again. [THUD] [LAUGHING] That statue is not going to do you a bit of good, little people. Oh, yes it is. Ah! Ah. Stand aside, people. We're going through the mirrors in search of tea. Not if I can help it. There's nothing you can do. I have the berries. One for Dabble, one for Swanston, one for me, and none for you. It's almost time now. Come on, Tuttle, give us five minutes to save our daughter. Your sentimentality-- it's quite touching, Gilbert. But the progress of science cannot be halted. Swanston, take hold of the people while I enter the mirror. No! [SCREAMING] - Daisy? Tuttle, please! There must be [INAUDIBLE] that nothing stand in our way. [QUACK] [GRUNTING] Tea anyone? Mom? Dad? Mary Margaret, duck! Duck? Roast duck. [GASPING] [ELECTRICAL ZAP] Your Downiness, are you there? Majesty, are you there? Oh. Dabble, wake up. Wake up. Dragora's disappeared. Mom! Oh, mom. More people. Retreat! Retreat! I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to cause so much trouble. Shh. It's OK. I'm here now. But how are you here? The same way you are. Berry Express. Now the question is, how do we get back? We can't, mom. The only way back are the berries. And there aren't any berries here. But it's beautiful here, mom. And Tansy and Melilot are really nice. QUEEN HYSOP: Mary Margaret-- Mary Margaret-- Your Majesty. I did it, Your Majesty. I stopped Dragora from crossing over-- we did, my mom and I. Your Majesty. Of course you did. I knew you would. You did? Yes, child. You're a strong, bright, resourceful people, just like your great grandmother. You knew great grandma Margaret? A good people, and an excellent mirror minder. Mirror minder? So it doesn't surprise me at all that she left her mirror to you. I'm a mirror minder? QUEEN HYSOP: You are now. Your great grandmother's mirror is one of the few remaining mirror in your world that can act as a portal into our world. Therefore, it requires mirror minders on both sides of the glass-- you in your world, and Tansy in ours. You mean I have my job back? Of course you may. But in the future, if you wish to nap, I suggest you find someone to assume your watch. Oh, don't worry, Your Majesty. I'll take good care of him. [CHEERING] Are you guys all right? Just ducky! [LAUGHING] But Your Majesty, we don't have any more mirror berries to get home again. Dragora dropped these as she went flying past. I believe you know how to use them. Oh, thank you, Your Majesty. Take good care of this people child, she is quite special to me. And to me too, Your Majesty. Very well then, I'm off. I have an entire world to tend. Thank you, Your Majesty. Good bye. [WATER RUSHING SOUND] Daisy! Dad! I thought that we'd lost you in there. Mom saved me. She was great. Yeah, she is great. I want you to know, honey, that Bella and Donna are welcome at our home any time. Thanks, mom. But Bella and Donna won't be coming back. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. It's OK. Every time I look in the mirror, I'll remember them. And I'll always have Tansy right in there. Well, we won't have to worry about that anymore. That's the end of the berries. I'm gonna keep an eye out anyway. It's a big responsibility being the mirror minder. The what? I think that's a good idea. You don't want to disappoint the queen. The who? It's a long story, Gilbert. Well, I'd like to hear it. How about over dinner? - Yeah. I'm starved. [SOBBING] Whoa! What happened to Dr. Tuttle? Oh, he made an important discovery tonight-- that love wins out over science. Oh! [SOBBING] Melilotus Alba. Melilot. Tanacetum Vulgare. Tansy. OK you two, dinner's ready. Hey, dad. What happened to all the mirror berries? They're gone, thank goodness. Come on. Dinner is going to get cold. I made your favorite-- roast duck. Let's get him! [LAUGHING] Dabble? Dabble? Dabble? Where are you? Dabble! Your Downiest Majesty. I must have revenge, Dabble, on the people child, on her people mother, and on all the people of the people world. But Majesty, before you can have your revenge, you need mirror berries to cross over into the people world. DRAGORA: Find me berries! Or find me some other way! [MUSIC PLAYING]
