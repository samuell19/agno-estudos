Been waiting for ya. How's Harley today? He seem extra specially happy this morning. I checked in on him real early and I got him some carrots - and a biscuit. - Ah! I brought him some fresh water. Here you go boy. - Thanks Ben. I'm sure he liked the treats, but you can't let Mr. Potter see you giving him anything. Harley's on a very strict diet, especially this week. - Aww. I was just giving Patches a little something and Harley said he wanted some too. - Humph. I am sure he did. Alright, enough of this mooshy stuff. I got work to do. Harley's our big ticket, right Ben? All things better. Let's go show Potter what we got. Thank you. - Bye Harley. Bye Jo. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ - I want to talk about those materials and I have some questions. First of all where are the materials? They're supposed to be here last night. Look, no excuses I want those materials there today. And by five o'clock. Call me back. - Hello Mike. - Hello Potter. - I didn't expect you until this afternoon. Always happy to see you, my friend especially on a beautiful day such as today. How are things over at Purina? You know if we win one more Grand Prix this Saturday, Harley and Jo are eligible for the Million Dollar Grand Prix. I think Harley would make a smashing Purina Ambassador, don't you? - He's a horse with a lot of promise and a lot of heart. Yeah, we all hope he'll makes it, Potter. Harley's looking well conditioned. His haunches are looking well defined...his coat looks good. - Ah Mike...he's a horse with the will to win and the strength to match. Let me show you something. It's true he gets his strength from his Sire, Sir Henry, but it's Harley's Dam who keeps him a bit tameless and swift. This is his Dam "Hara" named after her Great Dam Hara of Yorkshire. Oh the mare was a bit of a legend in Old Yorkshire, England. She was a gift to Lady Mercy Aireley on her wedding day from Sir Thomas Dodd. And the match between horse and rider was never a better one. Some say that it was a match made in heaven for they were constant companions when Sir Thomas went off to war. And, on those long and lonely days riding through the Yorkshire hills, Lady Aireley would often say that she and Hara could jump to the stars and see her husband at the front. Ha Ha Ha. Unfortunately, at the very end of the war, the influenza pandemic swept through the valley and took the lady's life. When the lady was gone, the horse disappeared never to seen again. And when Sir Thomas returned home, it was said that he would often gaze into the night sky, and remark that it gave him some comfort that he could see Lady Aireley and Hara riding together in the stars. - Ha Ha Ha - I like that. Now you let me know if there is anything at all you need from Purina. Good luck tomorrow. - Right oh... - What was that? - I don't know. He spooked alright? It's fine. It's not like Harley. He's just.... Look he's been a little off. You're scaring him. Alright, I got it. He's just been off on the left since the last show and something just set him off, alright. He's fine. He's gonna be fine. - I'm counting on him being fine, Jo. This is your mount. It's your job to know everything about this horse at every minute! Don't make me - get on this horse and ride him myself. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let go, let go. Gosh. Mr. Potter, I need to get this horse inside and ice it's leg before it swells up. - Look, you cool him down quick, you get him back to the stable, ice that leg, and don't ever let this happen again in front of a sponsor, no one needs to know our business, a winning Harley, that's all they want. Yes, get Dr. Sterling over here, straight away. - Yeah, who knows how these things happen. Sometimes simple fatigue can cause a misstep. Hopefully with a little rest and keeping off - that leg that should take care of it. - I should have seen this coming. I knew we'd been working him way too hard between shows. - Potter, the horse just needs rest. You shouldn't show him this weekend. - Nonsense. It's a minor sprain, give him an anti-flammatory, - he's had worse. - If the horse doesn't take it easy, you could risk blowing him up, physically and mentally. - It's not an option. - You know, if it weren't for the prize this would be a non-issue, - wouldn't it Potter? - It's just business. You and I both know it's done every day. Now give him the shot. He's jumping Saturday and if you don't do it Doctor I'll find someone who will. - Fine... ♪♪ - He's starting to calm down, but he's been a lot more jittery than normal. - It's the wind, he's fine. You alright boy? You get some rest, you're my rising star of the stable. There's no stopping you now. Make it happen tomorrow Jo. Five thirty AM loadup. - Yes sir. Alright. Ooh! What? You don't want it on? You know what? You don't have to. You know what, we're even going to start taking some trail rides, but you gotta be a good boy tomorrow, okay? But no more stunts like you pulled today, okay? - Lets go Jo, lights out! - I'm coming! Alright, be a good boy, I'll see you tomorrow. ♪♪ ♪♪ - Whoa. - Well, not too bad of a time maybe you better stick to roping. Sonny! C'mon boy! - Wasn't that much fun anyway. - Hey! Keep working on it Sarah, the fun's in trying. Okay? Now you'd better make sure your chores are done before dad gets back from the range. - Dad's home! He told me to tell you that he wants the chores done now! - Alright! I'm coming. Mose, I think my 8 year old brother can do this better than I just did. You're a good boy Mose. ♪♪ What is it boy? C'mon... Whoa, who is that? He's beautiful. Wait, come back! Sonny you scared him away. Come back. Luis, guess what? I just saw a wild horse. He was standing there up on the hill and all of the sudden it disappeared. - How do you know it was wild? - Well because its hair was all tangly and it was all dirty and scratched up and it just had the look of a wild horse and it was as quick as lightning. - And it was beautiful. - Oh yeah, when they're wild they're real nervous and jittery. Poor fellas, they're always on the run. It's probably a stray from one of the bands of wild horses. They always come down here for water when it's real dry in the Santa Ana's. Don't get too excited about that one horse. It's probably long gone by now anyway. Now, you wanna help me uhh get these stalls cleaned up before dinner? - I gotta go see Chloe first. - Thank you Sarah. - Hi Chloe! - Sarah, I'm trying really hard to concentrate. - Hi. - You look like a princess up there. - A princess? - Yeah! And you make it look so easy. - What are you talking about? Barrel riding is easy. This is real hard "horsemanship". - Oh, pleeeeease. Barrels are so impossible, it's crazy and fast, and your horse could slip and get both of you killed you know. - I'm done with barrels and roping, cowboy stuff. I'm doing Dressage now. It's much prettier, and much, much harder. You can't even make the smallest mistake. Plus you can play music while you're doing it. I think that E & K are too far apart. I knew this wasn't right. - What's that? - Goldie made too many steps between the E and the K. - What is it? - The spacing is all wrong. - I'll go pace it off. - OK! Start over there at the first letter marker... that's where you have to trot your horse to earn points in Dressage. - Wait...how many paces was that? - Three. - It should be 5. That's it! There! Good. Alright, I think I'm done for the day. - Hey! I could do Dressage. - Ya think? - Well yeah...you got the arena, the letters, the map! Why not? - Not on old Moses you couldn't. It takes a certain kind of horse to do dressage. The horse has to have stature and collection - like Goldie here. - Oh brother! - How are you doin girls? - Hi Aunt Sharon. - Hi, mom. - Sarah, your dad called and said to come home for dinner and bring Chloe with you. Chloe, why don't you go clean up a little bit first okay? Okay? - I'll hurry. I'll be there in fifteen minutes. - Alright, see you at dinner. - Alright, deal. - My chores, ugh... Bye. - See ya. - Stop poking around the kitchen and come help me shuck this - corn before dinner. - Ohhh man! But I'm starving! And besides, this is a girl's job. - Hey! Watch who you're talking to. I'm no girl. Do I look like a girl to you young man? No... So the quicker we get this done, the quicker we have dinner, okay? - Okay. - But go wash these grubby little hands first. - Mah. - And I mean snappy buddy! - We got a good herd this spring. Looks like we're going to be adding - maybe 70 to 80 calves real soon. - That'll bring us up to near - 800 head, boss. - Not bad...so you gonna need some extra - hands with the calving Tiny? - No, they all don't come at once! - Ha Ha, well they kind of do in a couple months time. Ha Ha - Oh...I forgot my chores. - I finished them up. - Thank you so much, I'll help you tomorrow. I'll do some extra, I promise. - Well..I got Sarah and Scout around if I get in a pinch. - don't I guys? - Yeah, I can help you out Tiny! - Ha ha..Oh no, only if you really need me. - Well, in the mean time we've got over 700 head of cattle; over 2000 acres of fresh land. And I'll tell you what, your Great Grandpa Miller would be very proud to have seen it grow to this. - How many days do you figure it's gonna take? - The whole next week. - Hope it doesn't rain on us. Last year it rained and rained. Could hardly see - the cows in front of my hand. - Charlie's gonna need to make us a nice pot of hot stew...mm how about my pecan pie. - I think maybe you need to take it a little bit easy on my pie there Tiny. Ha ha ha - Oh, oh! Scout move over, Chloe's here, I was saving this seat for her. - Where am I supposed to go? - I don't know, just go. - Sit right over her buddy. I reserved this just for you. - Hey everybody. - Hey Chloe. - Hi uncle Hank. Oh, I brought you these new dressage magazines to look at. - Oh thanks. - How come you dressed up for dinner on a ranch with all boys? You look like Queen Elizabeth. Look at Sarah. She's a real Miller cowboy, - not too girly. - Please pass the potatoes. Thank you. - I don't know, I'd say she's all girl. She's looking more and more like her mom everyday. Her mom was a real cowgirl. She could hold her own against all these guys right here. The number one thing, your mom was a fine lady. - She wasn't just a cowgirl because she married a cowboy, she just liked horses. There was a lot more to do then just chase around dusty - cows all day. - If wanna see a real cowboy, I - just look in the mirror...plus I got the best cutting horse in the county! - None of you know how to ride the proper way, like in Dressage, - right Chloe? - You know, I think there's all kinds of horses for all kinds of jobs. You know, they're meant to run free like they were born to but they like hard work. I'll tell you what, you know what this ranch does, the one thing this ranch does is gives them purpose, in a world that doesn't have much use for them anymore. - Sarah uses them for pets...treats horses like giant dogs. Maybe you should teach Moses how to sit or roll over. - Now, there are some people who have a special way with horses and they can train them to do all sorts of things. - Did you ever see that video of the horse who rides in a convertible car shotgun and goes through a drive-up window and orders fries and a burger? It was the funniest thing I ever saw. And then the horse, he goes into his own bedroom and tucks - himself in, I mean. - They were probably feeding him treats off camera. - Well, that's not reality. Horses are simple they got basic instinct. They get hungry they get tired, they get scared, they get thirsty, that's about it. - Hey, do you want one? You want one? Yes. Hey Moses, you want one? Good horse. You could do that, don't you think Moses? - All horses want to look their best, even Moses. For thousands of years man has been drawn to the horse just like you Sarah. I think God created the horse like no other animal. He may be in our custody now, but his ultimate ownership is beyond us. What an unselfish creature. He exists for the friends on his back and the herd in the meadow. A horse is a gift to the rider who gets to fly without wings. - Sarah, Sarah you asleep? - Ohhh, Dad. - Well, I didn't want to wake you but since you're awake - there's something I wanted to tell ya. - What is it? - Oh you're reading this? I think your mother read this when - she was a little girl. - Oh yeah. It's good. - You know, this ranch has been in the family for 6 generations. - Yeah I know. - I was born in this house. I was raised in this little town, and when your mother and I, when we got married, this became ours. And every morning when I'd wake up I'd love what I do. And I know it's not very glamorous but it's all I know how to do... ...be here with my family. - But dad, the ranch hands aren't our family, - Danny and Scout are. - Well, yes that's true... but those guys they've been really loyal to this ranch. They've been around for a long time, even before you were born. I mean Buck, Buck's been here since he was a little boy and his father worked with my father on this ranch, but the point that I want to make is that this land is all that I have in the world to leave to you and your brothers. - But... ....I don't want it, I ...I don't wanna work on the ranch. Let Danny and Scout have it. I want to be like Aunt Sharon when I grow up. She doesn't have - to work on a ranch. - Well... ...this land belongs to all of you.... ...whether you like it or not and someday.... ...I hope you find the value in it. I hope you see that. Alright.... ...go to sleep. Ugh! Ugh! I love you. - Night...I love you too dad. - Sarah, what's going on? Where did this horse come from? - This is the wild horse from yesterday. The one on the hill. - He's in poor shape. We need to go make him some mash, this horse needs to be doctored... What's your father going to say? Sarah, I have to go get your father. - What's going on here? - Well dad, this is the wild horse from yesterday. Today it came back. It came back to me. It followed me into the barn - and he was hungry dad. - Did you give him some water? - Not, yet. He doesn't look too good. I don't see any... ...brand... It's okay, it's okay. good boy.. no shoes, I don't know if he is wild, he certainly needs some help and if not than we know there's somebody out there looking for him. - Dad, he's from one of those bands of wild horses, but that's okay, I'll take care of him. Lots of people adopt wild horses. - No I don't want you anywhere near him until Doc Higgins gets a chance to look at him. Okay? Alright now off to bed, you got school in the morning. - But dad I can't leave him. I don't want to go to school tomorrow, - Absolutely... ...not.. Take this horse down to the last stall; I don't want him upsetting all the rest of the horses. Get him some blankets and make a poultice for his legs and I'll call Doc Higgins in the morning and I'll, uh, I'll inquire around town. Lets go young lady, time for bed. He'll be alright. - You got five minutes. - Fine. - And I'll be right there. - I'll stay by the horse tonight. - Okay. - Is he okay? - He's pretty sick. He's got Potomac Horse Fever from drinking bad water out there but, it happens. Doc Higgins is gonna intravenous going uh, put some antibiotics and anti-inflammatories - in him. - Yeah honey, he's Colicky and he's got some edema, but he was a smart horse finding his way back to this ranch for food and water. - That's your bus. You'd better get going. - But Dad, I can't leave him. He's sick. I have to stay with him! - You need to go to school. He'll be here when you get back. Now get going before you miss the bus. - Oh. Wait till you see him! - I can't wait I've never seen a wild horse before! - Well then hurry up! Oh. - Wow... ..my gosh look at his coat it's all scratched and scarred he probably has ticks too. Was he born in the wild? - Probably. - What are you going to do with him? - I'm going to keep him. I'm going to call him Handsome. - He's Beautiful. - It's my boy. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ - Hey Sarah, how's Handsome doin? - Oh, he's doing real good. - Great well, old Tanner here just wanted to come in and say hello. - Thanks Danny. - Well I gotta go, take care. - Oh hey Miss Sarah, how's Handsome doing today? - Oh, much better! - Alright, glad to hear it, old Moses here just wanted to make sure. Alright see ya later Miss Sarah. - See ya Chuck. - You know I'm real proud of you, the way you've taken responsibility for the rehabilitation of this horse. This isn't the same horse anymore. Doesn't have that wild look anymore, you did good. But I don't want you getting too attached to him Sarah. - Why? - He doesn't belong to us. - Well, it's been weeks and nothing. Has Deputy Andy said anything? - No. - Then I'm not gonna worry. He must have been wild for a long time. Someone didn't want him dad. People do this all the time nowadays. And Aunt Sharon she said that if someone can't take care of the horse or pay for it, then they just drop them off at the edge of a reserve and then they join the wild herds. - I know, I know. Okay, but just don't get too attached to him. - I'm proud of you. - Alright. - Sarah Miller, that's enough! Stop taking all my produce and giving it to your animals! People eat carrots too! - Oooops! I'm sorry Charlie, I didn't mean to, - I was just.. - What, I thought it's time you made some treats just for the horses. I have here a fine cook book. It says specifically for horse treats.

Can you stand? - Yes dad, I'm okay...just knocked the wind out of me for a minute. - You have to go catch "H"! - Listen, - that horse is way too hot blooded for this ranch! You could have been killed! - I was day dreaming! You know how I do! Did you see me? I was going so fast I didn't even feel the ground dad. - Why were you out here on this horse in the first place? Huh? I mean, does Luis know about this? - No, I mean yes, I mean I didn't see why not he's doing great now! I'm sorry....I just wasn't thinking. - Okay. Well we're going to have to go back on my horse. You ready? - But what about my horse? - It's not your horse. C'mon , let's go. - I'm fine. - Hmmmm. - So I was galloping along in the green hills and the sky was so blue it almost blinded me.. - Then what happened? - I felt like I was in some far off land, not at the ranch anymore.. - Really? Where were you? - I was flying over everything around me. - And then what happened? - and then all of a sudden I saw the herds and they were right there! Then I thought to myself...hmm..where is dad? - Did you see me? - I didn't realize I was going so fast. It was like, like I was driving a race car or something..hmm. "H"... he's just the happiest when he's going fast.. glides through the air... Plus I wanted to show dad. - Wow, I wish I was there! I missed everything good. - Can you move your fingers like this? - That? Yeah it kind of hurts though. - What about like this? - Oh, ha ha! Umm, Yeah. - Hey, What are you guys doing? No don't wiggle it like that, you heard - what the doctor said you need to rest it. - We're just checking on the mobility of her agility. - Her mo.. Scout isn't it your bed time? Scout isn't it your bed time? - No, no it's not. - Scout, it's time for you to go to bed. - Okay. - I'll check on you in a minute. So how are you feeling? - I can't believe he's gone. I mean, where would he go? Is he just going to run all night? - I meant how is your arm feeling? I can't even believe you're still thinking about that horse. I mean you're lucky it's just a sprain and it's not broken, or worse... you could've been killed. Even if that horse was still around and didn't run away, I wouldn't let you near it. Now there's something wrong with that horse. - Dad, don't say that! It's my fault. I didn't see the herds right there and it's still so new to him and it's my fault. - Sarah, you can never second guess your mount, you know that, that horse turned on a dime, he's way too much horse for you Sarah. No, I don't want him on this ranch. I don't want to hear about it anymore. That's the end of it, alright? Go to sleep. That's the end of it, alright? Go to sleep. Ugh. Now if you need anything I'll my door open, so you can just call me, okay? - Should have never let her keep that horse. Just way too much horse for a little girl. What was I thinking? - Dad, she's okay. - What would I have done if I had lost her? - Dad, you didn't lose her. She'll be fine. Sarah's a really good rider, I mean she's done amazing things with that horse. She had a really bad fall, but she's okay. - Some rancher probably just dumped him off in a reserve just like Sharon said. - Well, I think I'm gonna call it a night.. I gotta mend that fencing first thing in the morning tomorrow. - Okay, make sure you take Tiny with you? - Okay, right..uh dad, dad you comin in? - No, I'll stay out here a little while. - Okay..Goodnight dad. - Goodnight son. - Brought you a little something.. saved it from Scout the "vacuum cleaner". - ha ha Well thank you Charlie. - Yeah...okay...see ya in the morning. - Alright, have a good night. - I think he would have followed you anywhere Mr. Miller. It takes great strength for a horse like him to surrender. - Good morning sweetie. How are you this morning? - Good morning dad..hi Aunt Sharon. - You feel a little better this morning? - umm - Come over here and sit down and have some breakfast. Let me see that arm... How is it feeling today? - It was a little hard to sleep on, but I'm fine. - Your father just told me all that's happening. I see that you're okay though, thank goodness. Chloe's gonna come over in a little while. - Madam Miller, how would you like your eggs this morning? Poached, scrambled or sunny side up? - Umm, scrambled please. - Yes mamm. - That horse came back last night. - Really, he did? Where is he? - Stop for a second. I don't know if I can keep that horse around here. He's not a cuttin horse...you saw him, he's very nervous... He's independent... I just don't know what to do with him right now. - But he's such a great horse and, except for that one time. And I've been riding over with Aunt Sharon and Chloe and he likes Goldie. - Look, I just don't have time to deal with you and this horse right now, okay? - But... Where will he go? Who will he go with? - Well, I've had some time to be with that horse and.. he's really good with the girls in the ring..you know I think it sounds like he just got really spooked with the cattle coming right at him, - Uh huh. - We just need to desensitize him a little bit. He could do it. - Like that's gonna happen. I mean all we have are herds of cattle around here and they're gonna be coming right past this window in a few days! - Well...I don't have any cattle at my house, at least I don't think I have had any lately, have I had any Sarah? - No, no, I haven't seen a single one around there. - Well I think we should just have that horse over my place for a while and I'll work with him myself. - Really, you would do that Aunt Sharon? - Uhmm..well if your father says it's alright. - Well is it dad? Is it? I mean Aunt Sharon's so good with horses and she's just like mom, and she'll calm him down, he's such a good horse. Please dad. I'll do whatever Aunt Sharon says! - Yeah..we'll do whatever Aunt Sharon says to do! - Please. - You can only ride him when Aunt Sharon is there and only at her place, no trail riding. Got it? - Got it. - And if that horse acts up in any way, Aunt Sharon's going to tell about it and that's it. And this setup only works until I can figure out what to do. You got it? - Yeah okay. Umm, can I go see him now? - Yes, Luis is out there. - Can I go too? - Yes, you can go too. ♪♪ - Hurry, c'mon. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ It's a time that I remember ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ it's a place where I belong to ♪ ♪♪ ♪ and the dreams that I would follow ♪ ♪ and the hopes that I ♪ ♪ would find my way through ♪ ♪ this could happen to you, ♪ ♪ you, you and you ♪ ♪ if you follow yourself ♪ ♪ Yes, your dreams can come true ♪ ♪ every time you count one, two, three ♪ ♪ this could happen to you ♪ ♪ cause it happened to me ♪ ♪ in the days that I remember ♪ ♪ all the fun we had ♪ ♪ in the sunshine ♪ ♪♪ ♪ all the nights I dreamt the morning ♪ ♪♪ ♪ till I find my way to you again ♪ ♪ This could happen to you, ♪ ♪ you, you and you ♪ ♪ You can follow yourself ♪ ♪ Yes, your dreams can come true ♪ ♪ in the time that you count ♪ ♪ one, two, three ♪ ♪ it could happen to you ♪ ♪ cause it happened to me ♪ ♪ Here we go... ♪ ♪ - Okay Sarah, you and Handsome are up first at 12:15, that's in 20 minutes so let's go on deck and don't be nervous, okay? - Alright. - He's beautiful, beautiful, okay.

You were beautiful. - You did wonderful out there! - Thanks. ♪ In the time that you count one two three ♪ - Congratulations, Chloe! ♪ It could happen to you, ♪ ♪ cause it happened to me. ♪ - You know when I first fell off a horse, I was about your age.. I got dragged across a field. Oh, I didn't want to tell grandma and grandpa for days. And finally I admitted to it. It was my foot got caught in the stirrup. - Why didn't you tell them? - Oh, I didn't want them to not let me ride again. - Well, did they? - No. No actually they were very proud that I got back on the horse and started riding again. They just told me to be careful and that I was grounded. - Oh. - Ha ha! Good night Sarah. - Good night! - ha ha ha - You alright. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ - Come on! Come On! Come on! Get into that trailer, boy! Get in there! Thank you for your cooperation in this matter, Mr. Miller... - Dad, what's going on?! Where are you taking my horse? - This is the real owner of the horse. I know it was a surprise to all of us. - Thank you little girl for taking such good care of my Harley. I suppose I should offer you some sort of reward for finding him. - What? How do I even know you're his real owner? - Sarah, he has the papers on the horse. - Why now? Why didn't you come for him sooner? How did you know he was here? He wants to be here with me. He's happy here. Why does he have to go? - If you don't get my horse into my trailer, I'm going press charges against you for stealing my property. - Don't you threaten my daughter! And you will be getting a vet bill from me saving your horse's life. - Alright, now everyone just calm down. - Would you please lead that horse onto the trailer. - Now, young lady. - That's okay. - I'll do it. Come on. I'm sorry, I know. - What is wrong with him? You get that horse to knock it off. - How's he coming along, Potter? - Mike, Mike, well, you know. He's out a couple of months training but uh, he's coming along very well. - Good, good, glad to hear it. Harley has had a remarkable journey. He's no ordinary horse. - Let's go into the office and take care of some business Mike. - So sweet. - I'm glad Harley's back. - Me too Ben. - Do you think Harley liked it running free? - I don't know...sure went a long way, didn't he? - Yeah...Jo, why doesn't Harley want to jump like he used to? Do you think he's scared? - I don't know.. only Harley knows... but I think maybe sometimes horses, they just change.. - just like people. - Yeah..I guess so. - Yeah. - Put him in the second one. He's been upsetting the other horses all night.

You know, we have other rising stars in the stable. We don't actually need Harley now. I'm sorry boy. - Hello? No, my dad's not here. Tomorrow? What do you mean? Hello. How long will it take? How far away is this place? - Well it's a good few hours away honey. It's way down in the valley and we will get there as soon as we can. - But what if we miss him? What if we're too late? - Don't worry Sarah. We'll make it. - Hello. Yes, this is Miller. Who's this? When's this auction? Thank you. - My pleasure. Glad to be of help. - Well, is it okay? Huh? Is it? - Well, let's hope so buddy. Hmmm. - You're too late young lady. That horse is gone! - But where is he? What about the auction tomorrow. - The new owner already sent someone to pick him up. I'm sorry. But, you know, they did just leave 15 minutes ago so... maybe you can catch them. - We're too late. - Don't you give up yet honey. - Yeah. Mom's right, we'll find them no matter what it takes. - Wait a minute! I think that's him! Is that him?
