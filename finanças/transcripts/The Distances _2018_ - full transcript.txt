This is the bus stop, isn't it? Look, there's one over there. What number is it? - 240, it's this one. - It's this one. - Run, run, it's that one. - It leaves now. Yes. What do you mean "run"? - I think it's leaving now, okay? - I know, I know. Hey, it's leaving! - Are you okay? Do you need help? - I can't. - I'm late. - One moment, please. - Come on, damn it! Come on, Oli! - I'm coming! We're going with a pregnant woman. Come on, get in, I'll pay. Then we'll settle up. Ok. Bloody hell! Have you seen it? The ad's guy in the bus stop was Comas! - What are you talking about? - Yes! How can it be him, Eloi? Bloody hell! As if you didn't know him! - What did he advertise? - I don't know! - Get a little closer... - Come on, Eloi, it's so cold! One second... Now. Say... Dick-head! Dickhead! Come on. - It's here. - Here? - Someone's calling you. - Yes... Shit, but he works at home! Do we call him? I can't hold it any longer... I'm sure he's kipping... Yes? I'm the fourth floor's neighbour. I've forgotten the keys. Please, can you open me? Alex Comas Vinyals, open up or I pee myself in your entrance. - Olivia? - Olivia and friends. Seriously... Open up! Hello! - Please, where's the bathroom? - Down and to the left. What were you doing, man? Come on! Say 35! Happy birthday! - But it's on Sunday... - So what? All weekend. Bloody hell... How are you? Hey, watch out... - If the mountain won't come to Muhammad... - Yes... You remember Anna, right? Hi, we met a couple of years ago in Barcelona. - On New Year's Eve? - That's right, on a party. We talked... Yeah, wait, let me through. - What a great flat, eh? - Yes... It's big, it's big. I was lucky and I found it in the neighbourhood, before the rents went up. They made me an indefinite contract, very cool. - You're so fat, girl. - And you stink... No, you look very beautiful. Hey, where's Gari? He couldn't come, he's pregnant, - and the trip was too much. - Shush! Friends weekend. - Well... A few words, right? - How long are you going to stay? As long as it's needed. You show us the flat or what? - We haven't seen this one! - Everything's in a mess. You could've told me you were coming, bastards. Surprise! Relax, we're leaving on Sunday. It's nice, isn't it? - It's nicer than the other. - How do we organise ourselves? FRIDAY Do you have a sleeping bag? Yes, that's why I was going to... I don't have sheets for all. But... I can absolutely stay here. If you're going to be better, you can sleep on the sofa and Eloi and I sleep here. No, no, I prefer a hard mattress... For the back. Of course... Sorry about the mess... Everything is... I'm really busy and I didn't... - What are you doing now? - Nothing, some designs of... a website for a store that will open in the neighbourhood. Hey, did we come at a bad time? I know, I still can't believe it... How are you doing? I'm tired... Listen, Olivia, whose idea was this? - What do you think? - You're crazy. That's what I think. I don't understand how Gari has allowed you to come. He doesn't have to give me permission for anything... Plus, I'm fine; I'm pregnant, not sick. It's your fault too, because in August, you ignored us... I was there for two days only... I didn't have time to see anyone. Plus, I had a deadline when I returned, so I didn't... I really wanted to see you... He was excited about coming... Let's see if we distract him a little, he needs it. I'm going to do the laundry and have a shower, okay? Hey, which wifi do you have? The router is in the study. You have it all underneath. Thanks. Oh, sorry. Hey, if you're uncomfortable, we can go to a hotel. It's okay. Besides, it's only a weekend. Tomorrow, you and I could go somewhere, right? - And your friends? - They won't miss us. But you don't see each other much. Damn! Look where it was! I lent it to him many years ago. You like them? I've never seen you listening to them. Of course I like them. Guille? What? They're mine, okay? Man! I have plenty of food, guys! Oh, yes! If you want, we can dine out. It's better if we dine here and then we go out for a drink. Do you want me to go to the store and buy something? No, I'm going. - You do? - Yes. - Do we make a list? - Let's do it. - Don't you have to tell us something? - About what? Listen... - Would you sign us an autograph? - What do you say, dummy? Dickheads. Let's see! They were the... They were some sample photos to present a design. The customer liked them and ended up in the campaign... Right... What? What do we do? We're going to the store to buy something for dinner. What'd you feel like? One moment, don't change the subject. How does this work? Explain it to me again. You've made a model portfolio. That's how it's called? What do we want for dinner? - Can you bring non-alcoholic beer? - Sure. Yes, because it seems regular beer makes you fat. I want non-alcoholic too. So I don't get fat. - I'm going shopping. - I'll go with you. - And something else, right? - Yes, yes... I don't know, bread? Have you bought cheese? No, I bought many cold meats. With bread, it'll be enough. - But I want cheese. - Okay. - Cheese. - Yes, bread, cheese. - Tomatoes. - The beers! - Yes, we'll get it all. - See you. This had to be a small campaign. - But they paid you a fortune, right? - Don't be so sure. Shame on you! You could have told us, okay? - Hello. - Hello. In the end, did they renew you that contract or what? No. I have a part-time job in another company with a 6 month contract. Let's see what happens. - Anything else? - A box of beers, please. 47,80? Thank you. And with a part-time job, how do you do it? Well, I don't spend much money at my parents' house. - Damn! I didn't know. - I told you in an email. - I swear I didn't receive anything. - I imagined that. - It's full of Spanish people, isn't it? - Yeah, it's a pain in the arse. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. 35 ARE THE NEW 25! Congratulations, man! - No! We gave it to him tomorrow! - What? - Guille... - Damn, you should have told me. It doesn't matter, it's done. Guille, man. Thanks, but you didn't have to... - We are the gift. - Oh, yeah? Can I take it back? Thank you, really. Seriously, you didn't have to. Well... let's make a toast, shall we? We've finally managed to be all together again... To our famous friend! You're so annoying. I'm going to make some room, okay? You're done, right? Let me help you. - Shall I leave it here? - Yes. Eloi, man, I told you not to post this one, damn it! It's very cool! - Shall I leave it here? - Yes, thanks... - Remove the tag. - You look gorgeous, right? - Remove the tag. - I don't know how to do it. Eloi, bastard, shame on you, man! Tomorrow we can take another pic, but below this poster. Let me see. - It's very nice. - No, it was already done. - Was it? - Yes. In a way, it flatters me, you know? As an expert on dicks, I mean... Here we go with that subject... Very nice. Bastards... What did I miss? Ah, he hasn't... It turns out that your boyfriend, a few years ago... Stop, stop, stop. In any case, I'll explain it, okay? It's silly. On a summer, we were in Thailand on holiday and... We were at a club and I went to the bar to order some shots... How funny... And there I met a girl, we started talking and then, we started dancing and... He made up with her! And she was a guy! What? Yes, who looked stunning and you said it, right, Eloi? But then, she wasn't a guy, was she a transsexual woman? Well... not yet, I mean... Really? Who cares while you're at it? She was a fox. Don't laugh so much! It's been so long since the last time you got laid - you'd love to fuck her. - You can say that again! Anyway, I think there hasn't been a single trip in which something hasn't happened to you, Guille. Don't be so sure, everyone here has skeletons in the closet. Well, some more than others. Here we go! What little patience you have, Guille! It's true, Oli, I didn't remember, Comas is untouchable. Hey, have some respect, I'm pregnant. It must be that... Here we go with the belly joker. Shame on you! What's wrong with you? Are you jealous or what? Yes. You know you are the apple of my eye... Just by elimination, since he came to live here. - Nice... - Bring me a beer, please! And you, Anna, you lived here in Germany, right? - Yes, in Hamburg. - How cool. And what were you doing there? I'm an architect, but I'm unemployed now. - You speak German then. - Yes. - Have you been looking for a job here...? - Come on, give her ideas now. I wouldn't live here again. I really like Barcelona. Barna, right? Really? Yes, honestly, living in Germany depressed me a little. That's why I came back. I didn't take the cold and the lack of light really well. She'll find something. Plus, I got a raise. Money isn't a problem. What? You know what I mean. No, we don't. You're talking as if you liked... Anna to be a kept woman. Fuck me, I haven't said that. Well, I haven't stopped looking. What I mean is that she should take it easy... It's a matter of time now that the crisis is ending. In the meantime, she's lucky to count on my wage. - There are people who are worse off. - Oh, really? Yes. Look at Eloi. The bank is taking his flat and he has to move to his parents'... Sorry, but I do work. Getting paid less than 10 years ago. Please, Eloi! But didn't you say the crisis was ending, Guille? Oli, every case is every case. You can't compare Anna's case with Eloi's. Guille, I'm in Berlin, it's weekend, I don't care. I don't know what you're doing in Barna, man. In any case, forgive me, Guille, but I have the feeling you have the typical attitude of a person who doesn't know much of anything or doesn't want to know. It seems you're not aware of how frustrating is not finding a job. A lot. - Okay, Olivia, tell me something. - Yes. How do you know how frustrating it is if you haven't stopped organizing your awesome events? Tell me. Let me tell you. I do live in the reality. Yes, I don't believe everything I'm told. And for your information, my amazing events, take me more than 10 hours of work every day to find customers who pay poorly and late... and I'm 7 months pregnant... - You're not being consistent at all... - What? Sorry? With what? - Nothing, forget it. - No, what do you mean? Say it. - Don't you dare to say it? - Don't I? Say it. Say it. No one has forced me to become pregnant, right? You're disgusting, man. You really disgust me. You disgust me too. Come on. Let's go out for a while, right? We'll do the dishes tomorrow. Let's go out for a while, right? Yes, we need to get some fresh air. - I'll stay, guys, I'm exhausted. - Yes, I'll stay with you. We'll go out tomorrow then. Come on, don't fuck with me. Come on, let's go, let's go. Jackets? What do you want? I'll order, so I'll see which beers they have. A beer? Better something stronger, right? - No, I prefer a beer too. - You? Yes, yes, a beer, a beer. Gari, sorry... I'm running out of battery, but we've already arrived, and all is perfect. And... I think the baby girl loves to fly. Does this work or what? Yes. I smoke much less. You have different degrees of nicotine and you can also choose the flavour. I always carry two: one of mint and one of vanilla, with more or less nicotine, depending on the moment. And it's very practical because you can smoke everywhere. Considering how cold is here, it'd be good for you, wanna try? Yes, I'm going out have a smoke. - Cheers! - Cheers! No idea. He doesn't know where. Okay, thanks. What a jerk, right? What are you doing, fool? SATURDAY Eloi. Eloi. You stink of alcohol! Hey, hasn't Comas slept at home? What? Comas hasn't slept at home... Guille told me he left with a girl. He left us in the lurch, we've woken Anna so she could let us in. Hey. Leave me alone, you're so annoying. LEAVE THE VIKING YOU'VE FUCKED AND COME HOME I can't... I don't know... What are we supposed to do? Fuck, Oli! Again? Learn to knock on the door! Hey, his mobile's disconnected... He's a jerk... Are you sure he left with a girl? Well, I saw him talking with two girls on the street. Listen, Anna and I aren't going to stay here waiting. Well, what do we do? I haven't found a set of keys. What do we do? I don't know, if you want, I can stay waiting for him... This way I can bake the cake. Okay. - And what do you want to do? - Nothing special, go for a walk. Olivia, maybe you don't have to stay, come with us. No, it's better, it's better if I wait for him here, I won't be so worried... And you, Eloi, are you coming? Eh, well... - Do you mind? - I don't mind at all! - Are you sure? - I'm sure! - Okay then. - Okay, I need 5 minutes. Yes, me too. - Damn, it's like the Fruittis one! - I love it. - Do you remember the Fruittis? - For the terrace. - I'm going to kill your fam... - That's brutal! Look! How cool! - That lamp? - Yes. This colour... Hey, lovely, how's it going? No, and you? I've called him a couple more times and it's still disconnected... I'm starting to worry... Damn, he's too much... Do you have the phone number of a friend here or something? Eh... no. Should we call the police? No way, Oli! It seems like you don't know him, really. I don't know, Oli. Guille is right. I think it's a bit too much. He must be asleep, he hasn't heard the mobile and that's it. What are you doing? - I'm going to bake the cake. - Do we come and have lunch? We cannot let her eat alone. No, no, I haven't started yet, I will now. Okay, we'll eat something in some place here and we'll come back later, okay? Well, if he calls you or whatever, let me know, okay? Okay! I send you a kiss. - Bye. - Bye. Look, I marked an Italian restaurant around here... But I'd like to finish going around here. - Yes, right? - Yes, right? Okay. Hi, honey, how are you? - Hi... fine and you? - Very good. Are you sure? Yes, why? I don't know. You sound tired. Have you slept well? Yes, Gari. I've slept very well. Yes... And how is Comas? He's really good too, he went nuts with the surprise. - That's cool. - Yes. What are you doing? In a little while, I'll go to have an appetizer with Josan and Miguel. Oh, that's nice! What's up? You haven't met them in a while, I'm glad you're going to see them. Yes, you're not the only one... - What? Are you still angry? - No. Are you sure? You've forgotten your folic acid pills here. Thanks, Gari. What are you going to do? They have left to take a walk around and I've stayed to bake a cake for Comas. Alone? Yes, alone. And... why didn't you buy it? Because I wanted to bake it. But you're missing part of the trip, aren't you? - Oli? - Yes. - You're missing part of the trip. - Right... Say that again? - You're missing part of the trip... - Gari... Someone's ringing the doorbell, do you mind if we talk later? - Okay. - All right, one kiss. One kiss. OLIVIA AND COMAS PROMISE THAT IF THEY'RE SINGLE AT 35 THEY'LL GIVE EACH OTHER ANOTHER CHANCE Look! We're lucky, the queue is short, normally it'd be a 20 min wait. - Really? - Yes, yes, yes. There's a kebab there too, which is really famous, and it also has long queues. - You're seedy, Eloi, really. - What? We're in Germany. Right... And? It's normal I want to eat a Frankfurt sausage or not? Of course. - It's okay to do tourist things. - I like doing them. - Thank you. - You're welcome. If I'm bothering you, I'm leaving, okay? Anna, just you and me. Berlin. Onion breath. Is this what girls you pull online like? Well, there must be some fetishists, but in general, they're nice people. Yeah... right. - What's wrong with me using Tinder? - Nothing, everybody uses it. - No, not everybody. - A lot of people do. Sofia and Celia found their partners like that. Sofia and Celia were desperate, Anna, please. You're full of prejudices! No, no, no, sorry. It's true. Okay, okay. Why does a normal person, with a normal life, logs in an app like this to meet with strangers? Because he's a randy git or because he's a bit crazy. - Guille, have you ever used it? - No. So? It's clear there are desperate people, but saying that people who use it are randy gits... I can make jokes, okay, but of the 8 or 9 girls with whom I've met, I haven't fucked any. Since I broke up with Marta, I'm not ready to sleep with girls I don't know. I'd rather have coffee with them and if later on, something develops, perfect then. Well, it wouldn't hurt you to practice, because if you had fucked Marta thoroughly, maybe she wouldn't have dumped you. - You know what, man? - What? It doesn't matter... I'm sorry, Anna. What the hell is wrong with him? It's not a big deal. What do you think? Okay, I'll talk to him, really. But I wanted to have time to be together. Come on, Anna. Come on. Let's order some currywursts. This one? - Do you want ketchup? You do? - As you please. She's put mayonnaise too. I don't know what she said to me. I swear you're going to pay my mobile's bill this month.... I don't know, I hope something happened to you because if not, you have no respect, mate.... It's half past two now, so if you don't show up in an hour, I'll call the police. Comas? No. Is Alex here? Fuck! I'm losing my marbles. Comas! Do you know where we are? Don't you want to stop and check where we are? I don't care. We could go somewhere and have something to drink. It's just too cold. - Marion? - It's Anna. - Anna. - I'm leaving. What happened? If you don't mind, I'd prefer Guille to tell you. If I can help you with something... What an absurd weekend! Do you want to have some tea with me? Or... Whatever you want... No, I'm going to the airport. Whatever it is, I'm sure you can fix it. Hello? Go to hell, Olivia! Hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I haven't heard the mobile, I'm really sorry... Listen, Anna has just been here packing her things up, she's going to Barcelona alone. What happened with Guille? Are you with him? Guille should go to hell too! Eloi, are you okay? I'm fucking great! I'm fucking great! Are you drunk? Eloi? Where the hell are you? Listen, come home, please... Comas' girlfriend has been here... and... The thing is that he left because he didn't want to see her... Eloi... You're dumb, Olivia. That beer isn't yours. - We don't want you, grab your things. - I don't understand you! You understand me? Come on, hurry up! Fucking tourists! - Hello? - It's me... Guille... Come on up. - Are you coming up or not? - Oli. Yes. - Is Anna there? - What happened? - Is she or not? - No, she's left. What do you mean? Where has she gone? What did you do to her, man? What did I do to her? Nothing, damn it. What did she say? Come on up and let's talk. - No. Oli. Listen to me. - What? - Where has she gone? - To the airport. Back to Barcelona. Man, I've been... shut in this house all day acting as a doorwoman for all of you without knowing anything. Come on up, please... Guille? Guille? Guille! You don't know how ridiculous I feel sitting down... in your kitchen, wondering where the fuck are you... and who the fuck are you. Hello. Tobias! - Let's go! - I'm coming. Bye! Yes? I don't know why I've done it. You're right. You don't love me anymore. And... I don't either. Come here. Come here. - We'll talk in Barcelona, okay? - Yes. Okay. I don't know when I'll be able to pay you back. It's okay. This is where I got caught. But I've painted 8 more. What does it say? I'm a cocksucker. Is it his phone number? Yes. It's so rubbish, Eloi. I know. Come on. Olivia? What happened? What happened with Anna? Did you ask her to marry you? Here? Today... You're seedy. Excuse me? You're seedy. Look, Eloi, I'm very tired. Not now, okay? You're a jerk. That's why Anna told you to go to hell. You earned it. Are you going to give me couples counselling? No, you're the one giving counsel, right? What the fuck are you saying, man? You go around the world forgiving the lives of others as if you had the absolute truth and you have no fucking idea. Look, Eloi, I don't give a fuck about what you do but if what I say bothers you so much, maybe it's because I'm a bit right. It's so easy to go around the world as an unlucky good man, but maybe it's because you also earned it. You're a loser who's incapable of making progress. - Stop. - I feel pity for guys like you. Stop. Oli, for once, don't stick your nose into other people's business. Excuse me? I do whatever I please. Really? Then learn to don't fucking do it. He's old enough to defend himself. I'm sick of poor Eloi, damn it! - Who the fuck do you think you are? - Shut up, Olivia. What'd you say? What's wrong with you? I say whatever I please, okay? Yes, you say and do whatever you please and then, the rest of us have to go behind you like lapdogs. That's not true. - Really? - No. Why are we here? Because you've spent weeks giving us a hard time about coming. What? Didn't you want to come? If you didn't, you could have said so, damn it! Eloi is so right, you're very seedy. Why have you come? To propose to your girlfriend? You could've had your plan and not do it in a friends' trip. Ah! You've really come here to be with your friends, right? What are you saying? If this was about seeing each other, we'd do it in Barcelona. And we don't. Everyone here has come for their own reasons, okay? You've spent all day here baking a fucking cake! SUNDAY You have 7 messages. I don't know... What are we supposed to do? If you want, we can go and meet you, okay? Well, see you later. I swear you're going to pay my mobile's bill this month... I don't know, I hope something happened to you because if not, you have no respect, mate... It's half past two now, DISTANCES so if you don't show up in an hour, I'll call the police. Àlex, I'm home. We had to meet. Have you forgotten? This is so ridiculous... Hey, man! Where are you? I'm munching a sharwarma in that place next to Koti. Come on, call me. Hi Comas, this is Henning. I only wanted to tell you that they loved the photos. We speak on Monday. Bye! You don't know how ridiculous I feel sitting down... in your kitchen, wondering where the fuck are you... and who the fuck are you. Happy birthday, honey. Have a great day! Olivia told me they were coming to visit you. And well, I'm sure you'll have so much fun. I'll call you later. Speak to you soon. I love you, happy birthday. Kisses!
