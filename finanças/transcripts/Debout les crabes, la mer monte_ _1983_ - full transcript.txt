IT ALL STARTED IN THE BEGINNING... I'm hesitating. What? Sorry? I'm hesitating. Hesitating about what? I'm in two minds. It's struggling to choose. I was wondering which of you two I'll bang, so I'm hesitating. - That's nice. - It's not nice at all! She's crazy. You, honey... you seem pretty sweet. But not very sexy. As for this one... I'd like him more if he didn't have such a stupid face. - I didn't say it! - I can't believe my ears. Listen, guys, I'll put you at ease, alright? I just came out of Bethune Prison, five years in a cell. Today's my first day out. Well, fresh air opens up the appetite. I've made my choice now. - Really? - The tanned executive guy. He's alright. Are you nuts? You look like my parents' maid. Hey, now! Apologize to this woman, and fast! If not, I'll shove my fist in your face. - I didn't do anything! - Exactly. That's what we're saying. You owe her as much respect as your own mother, and all other women too, including maids! And she's been in jail for five years. Well? I'm listening. - Fine, I apologize. - You can do better. - What do you mean? - Take your dick out. Are you insane? Do you know what life in prison is like? Ever heard of Christmas packages ripped open by guards? And the suicides? Meanwhile, you're out living your life. Come on, get up, you wimp! Come on, scram! Go on, beat it! Hey, you forgot your jacket! And your briefcase! Dumbass. - Cigarette? - Thanks, man. Allow me to introduce myself: Louis Paimboeuf, geography teacher at Vaillant-Couturier High School. The funny thing is my father was a tailor, very brave, back in 1940. But well... That's how life turns out. Is it true I'm ugly? No! Of course not. You find me attractive? Yes. Why not? I could definitely find you attractive. That's nice of you. You're not exactly the type I'd dream about in my cell at night. But I like you. ON YOUR FEET, CRABS, THE TIDE'S UP! - Are you going to Rennes? - Yes. - Got a place to crash there? - I don't need one. Why not? Because I'll take a train straight back to Nantes. Why? - I'm meeting someone. - In Nantes? Yes, I'm meeting a bastard in Nantes. A meeting I pushed back five years due to unforeseen circumstances. Don't you think a short stop in Rennes... to rest for a bit before heading to Nantes would do you some good? I'll invite you over to my home. You'll see, my wife is very nice too. She has the same ideas as I do. My house is small but very comfy, I have two charming kids... - It's not your wife I want to see. - Slow down! Where's the fire? The fire's right here, burning hot and very centralized. Don't you find this a bit abrupt, in a train? Where's the poetry? It's railway poetry! Exactly, you deserve much better. - Do you need a pen to express yourself? - Not necessarily. What's wrong, then? I don't inspire you? I don't even know your name! Marthe. Tickets, please. Sir, madam? Tickets, please. It's obscene! They're perverts! Shit, shit, shit! Where are they? In here. Oh, sorry. Do excuse me. You idiot! Are you sulking? - No... - What's wrong, then? Nothing... - You didn't like it. - No, that's not it. - I don't get it. - It's too much. It's too real. I love my wife, we were happy when we made our two kids. You know, Marthe? Sometimes, this is harder than a game. Harder than anything. I have to be alone. So, sometimes, at night, I get up, get dressed, and head outside. There I am, under Saint-Michel Bridge in Rennes. On your feet, crabs! The tide's up! Sounds logical. That's just your personality. But that's not it, I swear. I just let out a fart and... the night is lit up. A FILM BY "AS LUCKY AS A BROKEN-DOWN TRUCK" They say that in life, furniture has drawers and husbands have surprises. My hubby is all of that, by he's my hubby, mine, and no one else's. Hello. Hello. You too, then? Sorry? I was saying, you wear Aubade lingerie too? Uh, no, I don't think so. Is that scandalous? Either way, I understand your hubby now. You're absolutely charming. Can I help you? No, I was just looking for the lid of my wax container. My name's Agnès. I'm Marthe. - Louis' coming, he's parking the car. - Oh? Are you a friend of his? We met in the train, I'm just out of prison. Really? Five years in jail. Rémy, could you make us some coffee, please? - Do you live in the area? - No, I'm just passing by. I'm meeting someone in Nantes. Your husband kindly offered to let me stay three days. That's good. You know, after five years in the slammer... for... - He's agreed to it, you know? - I don't understand. Thank you. Marthe, this is Rémy, our eldest. He's very athletic. - Hello, ma'am. - She's a friend of dad's. Go get your stuff ready and I'll take you to school. Okay, mom. And tell your sister to get dressed! She's already left with grandma. Uh... What were we saying? Have you gotten acquainted yet? Yes. You alright? Yes, honey. Well... I'll leave you two, I have to take the kids to school. - Here. - Can I do it? It's been five years since I've driven, I would really enjoy that. That way you can have a nice reunion, just the two of you. - Well, if you want to. Right, Agnès? - Sure, honey. Alright, kids. Marthe will take you to school. Pauline's already left with grandma. Rémy! You'll show her how to get to school. Come on, let's go. See you later! But... who is that girl? Just a poor girl. She was behind bars. That must be really tough. So, I thought, since we both have the same idea, we could give her a hand to reintegrate society again. You did a good thing, darling. - There's just one problem. - Really? Yes... It's been five years since she's... Since I invited her here, she said she'd accept to stay, but she needs it every day. And more than once each time. Well, I... But I won't do anything unless you agree to it. But... Me, agree? What am I agreeing to? Well, to, uh... Believe me, she wants a lot! Oh, right! You scared me! Of course, honey. We're not going to argue over nothing. And it makes sense, female solidarity and all. If women don't help each other out... You're incredible, Agnès. My darling little wife. - Any news from Polo? - No, I haven't seen him. - And your doctor's visit? - Nothing bad. Just my blood pressure. It pumps too fast, I don't have any red lights. Listen, we could invite her to a restaurant, get her some good food. Grandma could keep Pauline for the night. That's a great idea. My house and two kids have no surprises. No surprise drawers here. Mine are always neat and tidy. Except when someone's hand comes in and rummages around. Happiness is sacred, and what's sacred is my home. - Honey? Can you come help me? - Yes. Tell me, honey. Are you sure you don't have anything? Agnès, you've got something in your head! I have nothing to hide from you. Here. It's all here, in the prescription. No more salt. For me, that's fine. But for the kids... Ever since you have high blood pressure, the kids are surprised. Marthe does it the old-fashioned way. Well, you know, the modern way... - Agnès? - Yes, honey? I must remind you that this Friday, meaning the day after tomorrow, it's Rémy's birthday. I'm getting him a bike. But you already have! You know, Rémy... He's 14 years old, he sucks in math, he hasn't done "it" yet, and lately, he's been watching me strangely. Me, his mother! - Through the key hole? - Even face-to-face! - I'll talk to him. - Well, listen... He's still a kid. Yeah, but... Hey, there she is. Come on, hurry. Who's that with her? I don't know. Where's the bathroom? At the end of the hallway. You go get all cleaned up, okay? I trust you. I won't take long. You coming? - Take me, honey. I'm in the mood. - With the brush? It's okay, don't bother. The premature ones are ideal. Just like an express train, enjoy a quick ride and pay. This is for the kids. Mimi Lafrance... You had such a pretty name. - Is Jeanine there? - She's with a sucker. Is that you, Roberte? No, I'm Josette, little guy. You can't tell, my voice's hoarse today. You're not working today? You're on strike, lazing about? And what about me and Mimi Lafrance? My mind was on other things. I've just been with a nice, clean old man. You've got your throne in the right place. Hand the money over. This dumb old clog... Don't clog it up, that's a tool for work. Have you seen Irma Hispano? She's at the Two Angels. You're looking for her? - A bit, yes. - Feeling worried, Mimi? Why do you say that? No reason... Just that we're in October now. When you get knocked up in October, you give birth in October five years later, right? Isn't that Marthe's case, by any chance? You're lucky, aren't you? Born with a silver spoon in your mouth. Thanks to this, I need my cane. Otherwise, I'd use it on you! And it's white oak too. Don't yell too loud, Mimi. The reason we work for you is because we respect your condition. But you better not push it. - What did they say at your visit? - Negative. Well then, same rhythm, same elements. Put your all into it, after all, it's for Mimi Lafrance. If you need me, I'm at the Two Angels. Here, Lafrance. It's a gift. Here, touch it. The plus with this one is it's two-fold: the white cane and the dog together. Ideal, isn't it? It's ideal, you said it. They don't make taxis like you anymore. There'll always be guys as blind as a bat. "Blind as a bat?" Well, this bat wants a drink. If you need me, I'm at the Two Angels. My parents were farmers. Country folk, if you prefer. My dad died when I was 12, so my uncle came to live with us. After my First Communion, my dear uncle was feeling really horny. So, he caught me in the vestibule, up against the broken clock. You know, those big cuckoo clocks, with the clapper banging it left and right? - They don't stop ringing. - He's a monster! Hold on a sec, there's more! My uncle got stuck there, and I wouldn't stop ringing. What a monster! - How old were you? - I told you, I was 12. My First Communion, a big formal event. You should have seen it, the chaos! Everyone was screaming, hitting my uncle. They called the fire brigade. You should have seen it. But that doesn't tell me how you got there. One day, they sent me to technical college. A big idiot with sideburns in my class said to me, "You and me, we're not made for this. We're just wasting time here." In other words, "I'm taking you to Venice, I've got a Mercedes." It wasn't a Mercedes, but an old piece of junk. Venice was actually Saint-Denis in Paris. A nice sidewalk, on both sides of the river. Hey, there's one of your taxis. - Who is it? - Colette. Say, my dear Coco... you're forgetting my pocket. You and I, Mimi, we must fend for ourselves. I'm going freelance, fully independent. That's news to me. Nanar is offering me some advantages. The commission seems fair. And in winter, I head to Morzine. It's much better for my health. You should see my cherry. You shouldn't hesitate, dear Colette. - Isn't that right, Marthe? - Of course, Mimi. It's a free country, do as you please. Right, Marthe? Of course, Mimi. Only there's a slight flaw in your plan. And it'll make you... shit yourself! - Don't be an idiot, Mimi! - Shut up! Don't worry, Marthe. He can't see. He doesn't know where I am. Right, Lafrance? Think you're a smart-ass because I can't see you? Stop! It's me, Marthe! You bitch! Damn slut! Stupid cow! Where is she? You know, Colette... when I think of your poor mother... it breaks my little heart. And to think she gets sodomized by the Colomb station master. That's not true! The police never believed me when I said a blind man could shoot her right on the head from 30 feet away, right between the eyes. The result? Five years in jail. That Mimi was an artist. And a rotten bastard too, let's be objective. And you just accepted it? Well, yeah... Love causes lots of damage. It grabs you by the stomach and messes with your noggin. You feel so confused. Like a hurricane, pure disaster. So, you just dive in and wait for the tide. Could you come pick some dresses? A whole lifetime... He'll get what's coming to him. He offered me shit, so I'll fling it back at him. Damn Mimi Lafrance. I like that blue one. Should I try it on? I'm shocked, madam, I really am! - But is it serious? - See for yourself. The subject of this essay was: "Which career would I like when I become an adult man?" Or "adult woman" for the girls. Here's what your daughter wrote. I'll read it to you. "I love my parents, so I want them to be proud of me. "So, the career I want "when I become an adult woman, since I'm a girl, is to be a whore, like my Aunt Marthe." "I've never met anyone so nice, "and all the men look at her, "and I want to move the way she does. I want to be admired like her." "She told me seamed stockings will come back in fashion." "When I become an adult woman, I want to be loved like my Aunt Marthe, "and I really like-- Oh, yes, I forgot! I got the idea for this yesterday." Oh, shit! There were all kinds of surprises in Marthe's drawers. And the biggest surprise was for my two kids. My house was an arsenal. My hubby is so reckless. Watch out! Are you crazy? - Are you a man? - What do you mean? Come with me, I'll explain. Hey, what about me? It's my turn! "We walked past the Tresserre pastry shop." "She said to us, "My little darlings."" "Would my brother and I like some yummy chocolate cupcakes?" "Yes, ma'am!", "Then, call me Auntie." ""Yes, Auntie Marthe!", said my asshole of a brother." "She said, "I don't have a penny, but I'll sort this out."" "We went into the shop, so many treats! Oh, what a delight! It was full of brioches, cupcakes, candy, bubblegum, and licorice as black as a n--" "I'd like three chocolate cupcakes." ""Of course, madam," said Mr. Tresserre. "That'll be 1.26 euros."" "My Auntie looked around in her bag and said, "I forgot my wallet."" "Then, she said, "Will this be enough?", and she lifted her skirt." "Mr. Tresserre looked at her... her foo-foo... I thought his eyes would fall on the counter." "Auntie Marthe said, "Come on, kids, take whatever you want and let's scram."" "Then, she said, "I work as a whore. It's a very useful career."" "I must say 'twas... That 'twas... a wonderful day, and I'll never forget it." "What a great career! Thanks, Auntie Marthe!" Admittedly, it only has three spelling mistakes... Terrible use of the subjunctive... At her age... we all did the same. But ma'am, I'm afraid I must say... that in our establishment, we are unable to keep... a young girl with this kind of behavior. She's expelled? Yes, she's expelled. Because of an essay? Because of this essay, ma'am. Her essay! But Mr. Principal, I don't understand. Her writing style is elegant-- Yes, it is elegant, but... the career she chose, ma'am! But that's because she doesn't know the impact of certain words! - That's all! She's just a kid. - Yes, she's a kid. A little girl that's 11 years old, who wants to become a whore, just like her aunt! That's not her aunt. What do you mean, "not her aunt?" So, I'm making it up? Look here. "The career I want "when I become an adult woman, since I'm a girl, is to be a whore, like my Aunt Marthe." - At that age... She's a kid-- - I'm making it up? Sure, she's just a kid, but... she can't stay at our school any longer, I'm very sorry. Fine, she'll go to another school, one that's less shocked. - That's right. - A school with a broader imagination. A school that's less stupid. Have a nice day, sir! And give me back her essay! There's no doubt about it. The Left has taken over. - Polo! - Hello, Thérèse? Oh, sorry... She's busy. - Well? - Come on, Lou, let's snatch victory! Well done, Polo. And to think, yesterday, I was with Mireille. We celebrated my nomination for Department Secretary. Let's snatch victory! Well? All out of juice, Lou? - I must be coming down with something. - Then, put it down, it might help! She's packing heat. - Yes, they're all hot. - That's not what I mean. I mean something that goes bang, and sends you to A&E! Get it? No. Well, she's dangerous. Agnès and I are pretty worried. Here, look. Look at this. You just pick her up in the street, and you're surprised she's dodgy? Logical, isn't it? I just want to help her. - I like her, you know? - Come on, forget that. Let's snatch victory! Just like Polo. Second place at the '68 World Championship. Yes, sir! What a liar! You Portuguese! - What? - With those legs? No surprise your ugly cows become caretakers in this country! You're not screwing them! - So, you've got two women... - Yes. You're racist, you're out of juice, and you're on the Left. - Any objection? - Not at all. Go on, then. Wait. The day you'll screw someone else than your Mireille, and Thérèse is available on the phone, and your classes are better, they'll stop heckling you. - Go on. - Just a second. Well, shit. Come on, let's go get a drink. - Hey, Lou... - Yes? Do you know why I get heckled? It's because I never met my mother. One day, I'll have a heart attack in a cafe. That way, no one will know and no one will find out. - I don't see what it's got to do with it. - Neither do I, supposedly. What about Marthe? - That is her name, isn't it? - Yes. Can you introduce me to her? That's all you've got on your mind. And pants. Worry about your own pants. You're out of juice. You should just go see my wife, my Mireille, as you say. She's a doc, she can give you a little pick-me-up. If not, we can go to Lourdes. Polo and Lou have been close friends for a while. They've never had a falling-out. No surprise drawers. Just two cute little idiots. But I love them. They're mine and no one else's. Polo tells me you're out of juice. You know, Mireille, I'm putting in too much effort lately. Biologically speaking, and it's not just me saying this, both science and the clergy quite rightly seem to agree, men can only copulate 32,843 times on average throughout their lifetime. Women, 482,833 times and a half! And you want to mess all that up with two women? If you tempt the devil, you'll end up in hell. But it's not forever. I just need a pick-me-up, a little pill. I'm not a magician, you know? I'll check your blood pressure. Get undressed. - Get undressed. - No, I can't. What do you mean? Your clothes have buttons, don't they? It's not that. Do you want me to turn the lights off? - Come on, Lou! - Not in front of you, Mireille. You're the wife of my best friend! And as far as I know, and until proven otherwise, I'm the one and only best man for his wedding. Remember that feast? Especially that duck with lentil salad. Well, that's the night Agnès and I conceived our little Rémy. A real athlete. - Will you get undressed now? - No! How do I do my job, then? I studied for seven years! In front of an ass hooked on panties, panties on his head, and his head up his ass! Know who I'm talking about? Come on, everyone naked, we want real men here! Fine, but put on your surgical mask. Oh my God! What's that I see? You're all as bad as each other. Go on, lie down. Take deep breaths. - Okay... - Relax. Hold your breath. Now, exhale. Mireille, can you hear anything? No. Let's try the other one. Tell me, is it bad? - Oh, shit! - What's wrong? - The stethoscope's jammed! - Is that bad? Yes, it's really annoying. I knew I had something... I've got something too. Something creeping in my mind, just seeing you lying there. I've never said this to you before. I can't take it anymore! Take me! Take me, I'm yours! What have I done to deserve this? Agnès, Marthe, Mireille! Why not Polo too, while you're at it? Don't think, just do it! Fine, but you know, Mireille, I've always wanted to do this. Sometimes, in class, I can't help myself. I shout, "Pop quiz time! Get your papers out!" "Draw me a map of Calvados, with all its prefectures, cathedrals, and points of interest! And I don't want to hear a pin drop!" And in the meantime... do you know what I think about? Of Calvados! You're close! Of the Calvados, shaped like a butt. And I can hear it humming: Wee woo, wee woo, it's the French fire brigade! Wee woo, wee woo, it's the love brigade! Tenor, baritone, contralto... I'll sing all of it just for you! When two continental masses meet, it provokes-- Quiet down! the sudden stop of the glacier. Quiet! As I was saying, the ice's subduction stops suddenly. Quiet! Pop quiz time. Draw me a map of Calvados. Alright, young man, you're coming in on Thursday for two hours! And two more for those witty remarks. Get to work. I don't want to hear a pin drop. I want to hear you write down rivers and locks. In other words, the country's economy. Lemouchard, you're in charge. - Yes, miss? - I still don't have them. - Don't have what? - My periods. - It's not right season. - We're in April! That's what you came to tell me? My class is struggling enough as it is. - Mr. Paimboeuf... - Yes, miss? I wanted to tell you I can't make it to your private classes later. - And why is that? - I'm leaving. Are you going far? By yourself? I'm going with you, Mr. Paimboeuf, to the countryside, to a nice little hotel on the banks of the Loire, the Duchess Anne Inn, three stars. A nice tourist menu at 21 euros: frog legs, a white butter sauce, and with wine too. Quite a nice meal. Miss, I'm having a difficult time in my classroom and at home, and you come mess it up. - But it does sound quite nice. - They're in love! Some heads will be rolling soon! Michaux, Rigaud, Frotier, and Trouchard: detention! Whoever complains will go laugh in the principal's office! Whose daughter is right here! She can tell her dad everything, send you home, punished, and no field trips allowed! Now, get to work! - Well, miss? - Mr. Paimboeuf. I'm 20 years old, got all my teeth, except the big molar in the back. I haven't had any scars yet, and I'm here to get you out of this mediocre life you started 35 years ago! This is an incredible opportunity! Just look at me! A true virgin, all curly hair, all this just for you! Here! Miss! We're in broad daylight, everyone can see us! So, if you please, I'll help you when and wherever you want. Excuse me. Mouchard! Pick up every paper! Lou, what do your two women have that I don't? What two women? - Yours and the other one. - Which other one? The whore you brought home. Who told you that? The woman at the haberdashery. I went in yesterday to buy angora wool, for a tight-fitted outfit, pink, blue, and green in the back. Really? Do you think it'll fit me? In a color gradient. I don't know. Can I consider you to be a confidential confidante? That means be discreet. It's true, I have a wife I love, and for the first time, I have a lover. Why not choose me? Fine... If you can get into tenth grade, you have my word. Alright? Cross my heart and hope to die. I have to go now. I'm going to break your heart, Mrs. Paimboeuf. I'll confess everything. We're meant to leave together in his Peugeot 203 car, the 62 model, registered in Loire-Atlantique. Ever gotten into it that car? No, never. Why are you talking about his car? I hate the color. But he's the father of my children, miss. Well, I'm pregnant because of him. We'll call him Karl. Or Adolph. And if it's a girl? Scooter. And her brother? Karl, I said. Or Adolph. I like Karl better. Or Adolph. And what does Lou think? He trusts me. I'll make it to tenth grade. But don't leave me all alone with my doll. Come over for tea. Lapsang Souchong, Earl Grey, or Orange Pekoe Ceylon? No... A latte. Miss, I know, and all of us in husband's family know, you need a nice trip alone in Switzerland. The mountains, the breeze, the fresh air... No, the sea! Lou and I have talked about this a lot. He prefers the Loire. You know, you can't refuse love. And what does Mr. Your Dad think? No, we can't tell him. And Lou's wife doesn't know either. And Marthe either. Good evening, Mrs. Paimboeuf. Well, when I say all that to Mr. Paimboeuf, who works here, he'll fall on his ass. And he'll offer to pay drinks too. At the Duchess Anne Inn, obviously. Poor little Lou. Don't you hear all that racket? Scooter, I'll put my hands on her breasts! Are you mad at me for talking to you that way? Your dad'll be happy. He expelled my daughter for a dumb essay. I'll tell him everything. My Daddy's always happy. Especially in winter, when I get a cold. He says to me, "Come cough in my bed, in my arms." He's so sensitive to my cough that he catches a cold just for me. He coughs and coughs, while holding me tighter and tighter. Like a real lady. Well, shit. Ever since that Marthe arrived, my head feels like a drawer with the lock forced open. I discovered, oh, what a surprise... Mireille, the little miss, and all the torments of depraved acts by my dear Lou and you-know-who. IF YOU'RE COUGHING, TAKE SOME POPPY COUGH DROPS Ah, Mr. Paimboeuf. - Mr. Principal. - Are you a jazz lover? I'm not here because of jazz, but because of my wife. I saw her this morning. She's charming, so elegant, delicate, strong personality. An undeniable grace. What does she wear underneath? And on top? But Mr. Principal... Do forgive me, Mr. Paimboeuf. It's the jazz speaking. Do you like jazz, Mr. Paimboeuf? I didn't come because of jazz, but because of my daughter's essay. Pauline Paimboeuf. She's a student at your school. Well, I mean, she was a student at your school until recently. Mr. Paimboeuf... I expelled her this morning, not this evening. If it had been this evening, she'd still be one of our students. You see, Mr. Paimboeuf... In the morning, I'm a different person. But it only had three spelling mistakes! Mr. Paimboeuf, jazz itself is just a string of spelling mistakes. But I don't give a-- I don't give a shit or a fuck about jazz. My daughter gets expelled for a silly little essay. Whereas your daughter is null and void at 20 years old, still trying to get her first diploma, can't get into tenth grade, who still hasn't had her periods even though we're in April... She's not going back to eighth grade, is she? The Saint-Louis Blues. Does that ring a bell? I don't care about Saint Louis. I don't know how to play the Saint-Louis Blues. Will you listen to me? I don't have a gun... That's too bad. They're... quite handy. - Is that an incitement for murder? - No... Just a simple invitation. Wearing an evening gown, in the middle of June, under the palm trees... Madly was smiling nervously. When our eyes finally met, the orchestra started playing the Saint-Louis Blues. From then on, we were never apart. Until last year. After a badminton match, she had some early convulsions, relapse after relapse. Death was inevitable. My life was ruined. So, you see, when people talk to me about spelling mistakes, essays, diplomas, chemistry, gym class... I couldn't care less. Because for me, all that's left is jazz. Jazz... Do you like jazz, Mr. Paimboeuf? How about we turn the radio on, Marthe? Some sweet music. - With the stars out, wouldn't it be sweet? - Wait a sec, Lou. I gotta tell you. You know, when I was a kid, I saw a movie at the cinema. It was so sad. A blonde woman was crying because her man beat the hell out of her. A real beating, you know? But she still loved him. She hadn't seen him with his hat. She was really upset. And so was I. When she turned to her sister, who was unpacking her stuff... So, the night is pitch black. The wind's blowing all over. Violins. Suddenly, she turns around and says-- It was totally unexpected. She says... "At the end of the bar, over there, "a slut in a white blouse is daydreaming as she listens to the radio bawling out a sad song." It's funny. Now, I can't listen to the radio anymore. It makes me think of that blonde and her sister. It makes me miserable. Am I boring you shitless? No, not at all, Marthe. You're so beautiful when you're in high spirits, I'm on cloud nine. Being lonely is so dumb. Though, when you're dumb, you're never lonely. Hey, Lou, am I dumb? No, Marthe. You're just lonely. - That's dumb, isn't it? - Very. And now, we're here. Agnès, the kids, you, and me. The two of us. Everything will change. Cigarette? You're so sweet. Screw me, Lou! But aren't you a bit tired, Marthe? A nice little nap relaxes the whole body, and the head too. - The next morning, you're fit as a fiddle. - Screw me now, I'm begging you! - Only because it's you. - What a sweetheart. - Lou? - Yes, my love? I want some too. I am your wife, after all. I'm happy to do whatever you want, but I can't have a finger in every pie. What do you think? What kind of pie are you? Well, since I always bring in the dough, Marthe's a double-crust pie. Agnès is an apple tart, then. I could be a tart. I've been one for a long time already. Then again, I've done it enough to be a cream pie. So, who knows? I've never thought of that before. For me, pie was just a dessert. Once you have two kids, you don't really think of a third. You get used to it. My mother was a hairdresser in Carantec. She'd get die on her fingers, it was worse than grease. So, she'd wear gloves. My sisters and I refused to let her touch us. - I think Agnès is the double-crust pie. - Well? Once you two have decided, we can get started. And then... Actually, I've had it with all this, damn it! My geography class'll be great! Where's Mont Gerbier de Jonc Mountain? What about the New Hebrides? Is Ouagadougou's in France now? What am I supposed to say to my students? That their geography teacher, Mr. Louis Paimboeuf, a Breton man, who's thick in the head but not in his pants, dark blue ones... A power station was attacked by environmentalists! Well done, tree huggers! Two bitches were bombarded and just one transformer! Well done, sluts, bitches, and whores! Shit, shit, shit! Fuck it! Did I say something wrong? Your man's pretty sensitive. On your feet, crabs! The tide's up! Well? Have you decided? Yes, honey. Today's my day. Holy act of God, what nice weather! It's high tide, my little badger. Why do you call him that? Because we fight sometimes, and he badgers on and on, so I call him "my little badger." - Is it always this nice in Brittany? - This is seasonal weather. In this season, this weather suits us best. Well, almost... She's found her spark again! - Lou, did I say something bad? - No, my love. - What's she doing? - But... Is she a bit loopy? Hey, Lou... Come any closer and I'll jump! And I can't swim! She's been through a lot. Jail messes with your brain. - Marthe! Don't be an idiot! - Give me my gun back or I'll jump! - I'll give it back. Don't be a fool. - Good. Stop! Take the gun from the other end. And walk real slow. And you, Agnès, don't move! Marthe! I'm begging you, don't be an idiot. We're just going on a walk together. Then, we'll have a real feast. Agnès reserved a restaurant for us, it's got three Michelin stars! Marthe! Give me my toy back, Lou. What came over you? I love you, miss. You call me "miss" now? I'm just in shock. I love you. She seems so far away and small. Well, I mean, your wife seems so small and far away. Come on, let's go home. We can go to the restaurant and have a good meal. Will they have white butter sauce? They better! - And Gros-Plant wine? And butter cookies? - That's what I want too. Life is so beautiful. Ever since Auntie Marthe arrived, Lou's drawers are less neat and tidy. And I don't like surprises anymore. I'm sure you can tell I'm getting annoyed by the feelings those two share, without me or anyone else. Tomorrow, I'll take the 8:50 train. - You're leaving already? - When the time comes, you gotta go. I'll have spent two days with a family. It had been so long. But where are you going? A place to crash. And crash, it will! But you can't just leave alone like that. I'll lend you a coat. You're a great gal, Agnès. And I'll never forget Lou. And your kids... They're awesome. Two little angels. Especially Rémy. You can stay as long as you want. You've seen how things are at our place. The kids are going on a ski holiday with grandma. Why don't we go on a trip, just the two of us? I mean, the three of us. Right, Agnès? Sure, honey. We could go to Holland. No, you're very sweet. For me, Holland is Nantes. Nantes is at 8:50, and 8:50 is tomorrow. - And tomorrow is...? - Leave her alone. She wants to go. Rémy! Is that how you speak to your father? So what? And screw you too! I'm a man now. Right, well... You're all a very sweet family, and you've been really kind to me, but... I've digested the oysters now, I have to go take a dump. Hey, waiter! Waiter. Where's the shitter? What's the quickest route? Either way, I'm going down there, so... you do what you want. Maybe you're right, but my lesson on the Himalaya and Tibet issue... Bam! - Those Americans again. - No! Silly Agnès. The approach of a continental mass towards an oceanic trench provokes, whether you want it or not, the blockage of the drift that brought it there. Conclusion: the subduction stops abruptly. Everyone got that? - Lou, aren't you overdoing it a little? - It's part of the plan. And what about the plan for 8:50 tomorrow? It's a dog-eat-dog world. Don't you think you should go with her? I forgot to call Mrs. Pigaude. You can't have your heart on the left and your wallet on the right. This poor girl's lost. I know, Agnès. You and I think the same way. The sea snails with the white wine sauce were pretty tasty, you can't deny. I didn't deny anything, Lou. Lots of quick rides this year! They're real suckers. Here, this one's on me. No, Marthe, I'll pay. It's been a pleasure having you. Right, Rémy? In that case, I'm leaving. I'm sick of this. Fine! No one's stopping you! I don't know what's up with him, he's so nasty lately. Damn awkward teen years. Hey, waiter, what's wrong? An old guy in the toilet just had a heart attack but hasn't paid. - It is serious? - No. There's no hope left for him. It's too bad, he was a good client. Handed out some generous tips. Here, don't cry, pal. Thank you, ma'am. - Where you from? - Pas-de-Calais. No way! Me too! - What the hell are you doing here? - Boring myself to death. Come have a drink! Mr. Marcel! What are you doing? The soles meunières are waiting! And winkles for table 34! Waiter! Champagne! May I? I simply... can't help myself. My whole life was being a client. A very good one, at that. Is that Pauline's piano book? Even Mozart started when he was young. I've still got it. Thanks to the priest at the parish, when I was a kid. He made me play the harmonium in the choir. You play very well, Marthe. - It's not the Tantum Ergo hymn, though. - For the holidays. No, it's for the Captains of Gascony. Where is Gascony anyway? Well, in Gascony. - That doesn't tell me where it is. - In Gascony, he said! We've told her so many times. You see... I'm never going back to Béthune Prison. What I really want is sunshine, sandy beaches, and baobab trees. Are there Gasconies in baobabs? Are there baobabs in Gascony? Lou! Yes? Here. Thanks. Sweetie, you should go with her. - To Nantes? - Isn't that where she's going? - Yes. - Then, perfect. What could be better? - What about my sister's wedding? - Are you the groom? - No, my brother-in-law is. - Then, what's the problem? You're off to Nantes, on the 8:50 train. I love you, Agnès. Love you too, darling. I've packed a little bag for you. You're a great gal, Agnès. A modern woman, very modern. Go on, my little duck. I've got wings, I'm a real rooster. Actually, Polo will probably stop by asking for you. - Shall I tell him anything? - And you're my little chick. - Peep, peep, peep. - It's crazy how cute you are. - You can kiss Polo on behalf of Lenin. - Russian-style? No way, are you kidding me? Don't tell him we sent the Sauternes wine, or he'll get heckled again. Marthe! We gotta go, we'll miss the train. It's ten past already. Yes, I'm coming. Alright, off we go. - Bye, Marthe. - Bye, Agnès. Kiss the little angels for me, will you? Especially Rémy. - On behalf of Auntie Marthe? - Right. Come on, we'll be late. - Bye, honey. - Bye. Not very warm today. Hello, my little Polo. Is your little Lou gone yet? We need idiots, my dear. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Polo's feeling a heavy burden. A real big one. What's wrong? A burden as big as the nose on my face. I was like a wet noodle, all limp! My legs wobbled like jelly. Then, suddenly, I get hot flashes! Are you having a menopause, Polo? No, not yet. Go on, tell me everything. Do you know Jean-Pierre? - The head supervisor? - The head, yes, ma'am. I've been cheated on for three years, and I had no idea! - That's what's got you depressed? - A bit, yes! There was a strike at work, so I went by the restaurant. - That Italian place. - Toscanini? Yeah. I went to get some spinach raviolis. - You know Mireille loves spinach ravioli. - Yes. And a nice big chunk of Parmesan. And because of that strike at work... I return home at 11 a.m. Who do I find there? Jean-Pierre! - Jean-Pierre! My best friend! - Really? - Well, second best, after Lou. - Right. My best friend, right after Lou. Cheated on for three years! Three years! I slapped her good, that Mireille! You should have seen her face! It was pure poetry. She won't be doing that again! No way! Believe me! What are you doing, sweetie? I'm getting dressed again. But... What about you and me? What about me? Our little meeting? Well, we should wait for Mireille to feel better. This just isn't my day, is it? Shit! Shit, shit! - Agnès? - Yes? - Can I use your phone? - Of course, Polo. Hello, Thérèse? Oh, sorry. You see, Mimi Lafrance, for 150 euros, you get the crystal ball and tarot. If you add another 50, I'll give you the whole package. Not very expensive, are you, Irma? I see you're not eating dirt to make a living! You're at the end of the line, too? I have costs too, you know? To do my job, I have to change the crystal ball every month. - So, what'll it be? - Give me the ball. Tell me the good news, save the bad news for yourself. Except if it's really bad. One day... you were born. I know, I've been told that before. One day... you will die. Hey, Irma Hispano, I'm not paying to hear that. I see... women in your life. Yeah, the whole neighborhood knows! Even the police! Stop kidding around. - What do you want to know, then? - Don't tell me my life story! Get to the end. - I see... a journey. - A journey? - Where to? - It's more of a closed loop. A loop? Is it on interchange? A long journey... On a train? Bus? Plane? How many wheels does it have? It's blank, I can't tell what it is. - What do suggest I do? - Get a dog. I don't like dogs, they pee everywhere. Even on me! I won't let it get my shoes. Speaking of shoes, I see yours here. Let it begin! - Let what begin? - The music! Start the Chopin! It'll be the last one you hear, little man! Nice tune, isn't it? It'll guide you if you've got your glasses. Don't you feel you're telling me something... dangerous? Like an accident... I don't see any accident. It's all clean. Done calmly, without any rush or hesitation. A sense of premeditation. But nothing very serious. - Just a cold, then. Bit of indigestion-- - Wait! Don't move! Don't say a word! I see something... I can hear someone! Go on, then! What do you hear? Be quiet, Mimi! Last night, Jeanine and I ate too much spicy merguez sausage. It gives you horrible gas, you feel it go up and down. Then, you feel it explode and you run to the shitter. You try again and again, but nothing comes out. You come back to the table and have a drink. And bam! That feeling's back! - You feel it go up and down-- - Shut up, Mimi! - Who's predicting the future here? - I'm just waiting. You never see anything good. Shut up, Mimi! I can't focus! I'm losing my marbles... I can't see anything, it's all gone. No, wait! It's coming back! Mimi, you're talking with God Almighty! You're sitting to his right. And it's October... What the hell am I doing there? I think you're on the long vacation. Well, it's about time! Thanks, Irma. See you tomorrow. As for payment, go see Josette, she'll explain everything. Don't worry, Mimi Lafrance, I'm not that much of an idiot. If you have a problem, I'll send my twin brother after you! I don't work just for your pretty eyes, you know? Good, the slut is gone now. Otherwise, I'd be the one to stay. Now, then, time for some housework, laundry... cleaning up the family home. But... wait a second. Now that I think about it... Those two off on their own in Nantes, that sounds like a drawer full of surprises. Marthe. - What exactly is this meeting of yours? - I told you. - With a disabled man. - Is it that bastard you told me about? I could have a gun too, you know? You see crimes of passion all over the newspapers. So, why not us? You'd do that for me, for instance? I'd do almost anything for you, for instance, Marthe. You know, Lou... I can jump off the top of a tunnel too. And the fart of some old bum won't stop me. Yes, it will. One bum in particular. The one at my station. You're so sweet, Lou. Pretty soon, I'll need some protection. - The job's available. - For who? Me? What about geography? You'll see, everything will sort itself out in the next scene. I got the seven, 14, and 18, but in the wrong order. Give her five. - You know my sister, Ginette? - Has she decided to work for me yet? Don't be stupid, Mimi. No, she got the numbers in order, but it got her nothing! That's 200 euros and only two taxis left. How do I pay my taxes now? You work too hard, Lafrance. It'll be the death of you. - Don't talk about it, it's bad luck. - Everyone dies one day. Better late than too early, ain't that right? I'll serve you another one. Alright, just a quick one. Isn't it almost noon? - Guess. - Got a date? No, my insides are in knots. I've had to shit for two hours. My gut's a real mess. I'll go in first, then. It's urgent. Hope you're not mad at me, Lafrance. Hello, everyone. - What'll it be? - I'll have a Clacquesin. For me, an Alabazam. Nice and strong. Hey, it's Mimi Lafrance! Always looking so fly, Mimi. So charming. - Marthe! Been a while since I've seen you. - It sure has. - Were you on holiday? - On leave. Compulsory. At Béthune Prison for five years. With no remission. - Shit! No way! - Yeah. - Shall I get you one last drink? - I'm just starting my day. Just a quick one, come on. I don't have any Clacquesin up here. I've got some in the cellar. It's been there for 20 years, never knew what to do with it. A quick one, you say? You've got good memory, teasing my old habits. It's just simple teasing. It doesn't hurt. Gotta laugh now and then, right? Yeah... Hey, Marthe, we could talk business, you and I. You alone? It's as if I were. Oh Mimi, I almost forgot. Here. Feel that. You know this toy, don't you? - You won't do something stupid, will you? - Just watch me. Five years in the slammer because of your crap. But don't worry, if you're still feeling blocked up, this flaw in your plan... will make you shit yourself. I thought about you so much in Béthune Prison. You have no idea. That's nice of you, but... don't be an idiot, we can sort this out. Let's talk. The last time we talked, I ended up in jail. So, you see... No. You won't even notice it. Well, that's a dumb thing to say. You won't see a thing. You'll just hear it. Worst case, you'll even feel it. You'll just feel... Bam! Bam! Bam! Five years. One for every year. With no chance of remission. You're overdoing things a bit. - Marthe, put that thing away. - Shut up, I'm talking here. Be reasonable, Marthe! You'll get another 20 years in jail! Who's this guy? He's right! He's pretty smart, you should listen. I might, who knows? But you better start praying. We're going to count to five, and you'll soon see why. - Year one, I missed you. - Cut it out. - Year two, I really missed you. - Enough! - Year three, I dream of you every night! - Don't be a fool! Die! Here, Lou, hold this. - We're in quite a mess. - Yeah... These tights keep falling. I should buy a different brand. Anyway, this bastard had it coming. You see, Lou? You and I, we think alike. We shouldn't hang around. Don't move! We could say this is your lucky day. You think so? Look here. You and I shouldn't hang around. Follow me. Hey, is the gunfight over yet? You, shut up. Go call the police station. Tell them to send a car to pick up this maggot. Come on, follow me, little asshole. We'll talk things over calmly. I don't regret anything. I leave with my head held high, for a nice walk. Pardon me, miss, for the inconvenience. Have a nice day. You've got to be kidding! This is disgusting. And who's cleaning up? It's Lily? We'll send you a floor polisher. Yeah, you better! I'm getting sick of this! It wasn't too great in Tangier, but at least it was clean there! Yes, sir! Alright, let's wait over there. Sit there. I should have just gone to my sister's wedding. Huh? Just saying... It would have been better for me, my kids, my wife. My future, I mean. Your future? Well, I can see it all planned out already. No problem. You'll play a nice little violin solo. - That's a play on words, right? - You said it, little Louis. How do you know my name? A little birdie told me. Can your little birdie say how many years I'll get? Hey, now... are you messing with me? No, don't worry about it, little guy. My little birdie... You'll get it during the strip search. Nice and deep. No, really... Jokes aside, your name really is Louis? It's funny, sometimes, my wife calls me her little pig. Doesn't yours? What about my hand on your face? Where do you want it? Seriously, though. You really think I killed him? Well... With a good lawyer, you can even believe in God. So, you see, it's not personal. But you'll have plenty of time. You say that to make me feel better. Come on, don't worry. You won't... won't feel very lonely. At Nantes, I don't really know what to expect. Lots of drinking, I suppose. Who knows? But we don't know where to put guys of your type anymore. My "type?" What type is that? The type of little dudes with no tricks or betting strategy. But you won't be lonely. - I'll make new friends, is that it? - You got it. The call of the siren. Ever heard it? Come on. On your feet, crabs! The tide's up! Personally, I still consider my little Lou to be a good man. I believe he did his duty, and he can walk with his head held high, on a nice walk. Well, that depends on how good his lawyer is. He shot the gun? So what? Who wouldn't, in his place? If he'd said to me, "Raymond, here, take this gun and shoot that vermin." With my eyes closed, I wouldn't have hesitated. "I'm begging you, sir! No incitement for murder!" In all good conscience, I believe that this little geography teacher, a brave man acting surreptitiously... The reason he was armed in the first place was because he was scared. Because if Mimi Lafrance were here, standing in the dock, where my friend stands today... "Your client, sir!" "Evacuate this room! We'll do a closed hearing!" "And why would you be armed, sir?" Wherever you park your ass becomes a seat. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... Who here has never had a geography teacher with a gun? What about chemistry? And gym class? And Latin? How many of you have ever done Latin? That's what I thought. I'm rejecting this jury, or I'll just shoot them! "Sir!", "Shut up!" Because I'm about to tell you why he shot this pimp, and in the presence of the man's taxi. The Marthe in question, real name: Antoinette Jamieux, from Bourg-les-Gonesses, who he'd met by pure chance in the train... Yes, Your Honor, by accident. But no love accidents occurred. And without love, there's no murder. And without murder, there's no justice. And without justice... There's no understanding. Cheers! Cue applause. Got some booze? I'm running dry here. How'd it go? - Life in prison. - Huh? Life in prison. I'll get him five years. I'll make them bawl their eyes out. He shot him. And he shouldn't have. Did he love Marthe? Yes, certainly. He married her cause, her body, all of it. Including the cell he's married to now, very intimately. A cell in Nantes, full of surprise drawers. We'll have to cancel the subscription to your magazine. I don't read it. Since you've left, life has gotten a lot more expensive. I even had to cancel the holidays in Pradou. But I found a good job at the city hall as a typist. Agnès, don't waste your life for me. I'm not wasting anything, I'm thinking about the future. And there's a canteen, you can't overlook that. The food isn't bad at all. Like yesterday... Yes, yesterday, they had shepherd's pie and it was really good. And one colleague, Jean-Louis, what a crackpot! He said, "Alright, time to get the bottle out!" He took out a nice Corbières wine. Really? So, everything alright? - Yes, everything's alright. - Okay. Well, since Marthe and I are sharing you, it's her turn now. So, I send you a big hug. - See you next time. - Yeah. Hi, honey. We really miss you, you know? We feel lonely without you. - Luckily, there's Jean-Pierre. - Durocher? Yes, he comes over pretty often. We brought you the chocolate you wanted. - Need anything else? - Yeah. An ass. A woman's ass. I put the photo in the chocolate bar, just like you asked. That'll help you jerk off. Don't hold it in or it gets to your head. With a photo... - Who's in the photo? - Raquel Welsh. Damn it! I already did her last week. I asked for Clio Goldsmith! - I didn't find any new photos. - An old one is fine. - How about Michèle Morgan? - Are you nuts? You said "an old one is fine." That's the best I can think of. No! I meant an old one of Clio, nitwit! Don't worry, I'll do my best. I'm so lonely, you have no idea. - Without us? - You understand everything, my love. You've been so sweet to me. I love you. I have nothing else to do. It's so tough. So long. You know, Lou... I might leave for a while, but I'll still think of you. You're leaving? No, but I've been offered a job that looks pretty profitable. Here, look. While he's not looking. Dear God! No way, that's it! Everyone out! You should it to him again, didn't you? - Me? No, I assure you! - He smashed his head by himself? It's just a... headache. It only happens when I'm not looking. And at the same time every week. And every time you come to visit him! - He's emotional. - Yeah, right! Come on, scram! Beat it! Hurry up! I'll forbid you from visiting, you'll see. No, don't! It would kill him! "It would kill him!" Seriously? It's not killing me, is it? Alright, get out and hurry! Honestly! It's inhuman! I can't believe this. Come on, Lou. I, sir, had a woman like that. Like everyone else does. And like everyone else, I had an amazing mistress. I could ask her for anything, whenever I wanted. Mornings, evenings... during the week, on Sundays... Then, one day, nothing. Like a storm. The beach is empty. It came so close. Now, I've lost everything. Just a man, all alone, out in the wild. That's me. A poor little birdie, standing guard in front of an empty nest. As empty as my glass. Fill it up, will you? The same drink? - No, something stronger. - Sorry. Meanwhile, my friend... My best friend in the world... he has two women. And I know it! One's called Agnès, the other is Marthe. The reason I know that is because... his woman... his wife... was my mistress. That means he's cheated on too, you're sleeping with one. Well, maybe, but... Well, either way... Can I use your phone? If you want. Well, shit! The beach... the sea... the wilderness. Shit! - Hello, Thérèse? - Yes? I'm coming. Thérèse? Is she the one always laughing? Yeah. How do you know? I've just heard people say so. The beach... The sand-- What's happening to me? That's it, I can hear the heckles. I did say so. Station 14? It's the Two Angels bar. He's dead. My Lou. - I'm so sick of being lonely. - You're looking pretty good. - Everything alright? - As usual. We waited for you. And I didn't come. That's just like you, always joking around. You know, the azaleas look beautiful. It's like they waited for your return. Funny, isn't it? They're just plants. I've planted some camellias too, they're growing well. Although, it is the season. I'm lucky I got out in March. I didn't come here in the 203, it broke down. It's the radiator hose. It works fine otherwise, but today, for some reason... the 203 is kaput. Sucks, doesn't it? - What about the kids? - They're okay. - Okay good or okay bad? - Okay okay. Pauline couldn't come, she went to a surprise party. She's getting older now. But she said to give you a big kiss. And Rémy? Well, he left. He's signed up with the marines. "Broadening up his horizons", as he'd say. See it from their perspective, Lou. But they are thinking of you. And grandma? Well, grandma died in December. Right at Christmas. I didn't tell you because, while... But she thought a lot about you. And she didn't suffer. And Polo? They moved away. Here, I brought you this. It's hot. Where'd they move to? - To Africa. - Africa? Polo? With Mireille? They split up, actually. But... Didn't he write or say anything? Not a word? What an asshole! You know, it's been four years... Life changes a lot in four years. All the prices go up. Yeah, but I was working on my weights. I could have beat him up just with my pinky. - Is that hot? - Yes, nice and hot. But I've cooked some Marengo chicken for you. They delivered the Sauterne wine yesterday. - Just in time for today. - Funny, isn't it? Other than that, everything alright? How did these four years go for you? - For my ass, you mean. - Why do you say that? - I don't know, you asked. - No, Agnès, I didn't ask anything. And Marthe? Any news from her? At first, she'd write a bit. Then, she left to Metz, to see an uncle for a job that looked pretty profitable, she said. No, she sent two or three postcards. I kept one of them. It showed a photo of the cathedral. Wait here. Here it is. "I'm doing fine here, "lots of storks and people walking in the snow. "They say "God helps those who help themselves to a drink." Give Lou a big kiss for me. Thinking of you, Marthe." Strange girl, that Marthe. Yes, strange girl. Makes you wonder... It leaves an uneasy feeling. And... well, that's not the reason, but... I can't help but feel miserable. I have no political opinions. No opinions at all, really. Just emotions. Want me to turn the radio on? Lou! Where are you going, Lou? Where are you going? In short, I left. I was sick of it all. Five years in jail did nothing for my noggin or my willy. It was impossible to meet Agnès again. I felt so limp. In the train, I was in two minds about which cow I'd screw. But not in two hours. I'm hesitating. Well, believe it or not, neither one or the other! So, I thought, "Agnès!" Back to square one! Get on the next train. Go on, little man! Straight for the pharmacy. I gotta get it up! Give me some pepper, ginseng, ginger, or whatever! Some pepper up my ass, if that's what it takes! I gotta get it up! I'm calling the cops. Go ahead, you beautiful idiot! They're asleep at this hour! How do you think we lost the war? And repopulated France? Long live the nation! Death to idiots! He did it. "Two capsules when you wake up... One tablespoon... "Two teaspoons, depending on patient size. "In the case of confirmed softening, triple the dosage. Keep away from children and pets." We don't have a dog or a cat, and the kids aren't here. Bottoms up! Holy act of God! Better hurry up or I'll let it loose! Agnès! What's the matter, honey? We have a train to catch! And no stopping! Do you have my ticket? Are there any seats left? - Where are we going? - Just punch the ticket! Stop pushing! We're off on our honeymoon! - To Venice, my love! - On your feet, crabs! The tide's up! THAT'S WHERE IT ALL ENDED... THE END
