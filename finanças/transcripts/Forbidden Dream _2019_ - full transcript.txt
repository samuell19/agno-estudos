This film was inspired by historical facts CHOI MIN-SIK HAN SEOK-KYU FORBIDDEN DREAM Jang Yeong-sil supervised the making of the king's palanquin. As it was weak and destroyed in use, he was questioned by the court. Annals of King Sejong, March 16th, 1442 Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! 4 days before the accident All bow! Four times! Kneel! Bow! Rise! Bow! Read our Emperor's royal letter at once! Listen, King of Joseon! Though I've given several warnings, you've recently abolished Ming's almanac and tried to set your own time with your self-made instruments. How dare you neglect my orders and betray my command? This is my last show of mercy. If you wish to live, stop your astronomical research at once and destroy the instruments! It is your duty as a tributary state! Also, the one who stole Ming's technology and made the instruments must be sent to me at once! I shall give you three days! Bring me the one who made the astronomical instruments! Your Majesty! Father! Call the royal physician! Your Majesty! Ming has never been so resolute. Jang Yeong-sil must be seized at once! Though the instruments be destroyed, we mustn't send Daehogun to Ming! Daehogun is needed here! Please! If Yeong-sil remains in Joseon, he can always make the astronomical instruments again! Of course Ming would know that! I agree! If we surrender him to Ming, everything will be resolved. It is not that simple. Daehogun is a cherished servant. His Majesty's regard for him has changed. He demoted him to the Maintenance Bureau. His Majesty only did that because of those of you who follow Ming's orders! If not, our country would've been in danger! Please do not shield Yeong-sil for personal reasons, General! Mind what you say! Let's seize Yeong-sil then petition His Majesty later. Impossible! Sir? Yeongsang! Yeongsang: Premier Let us wait. His Majesty will not allow our country to be in danger. Enough. Your Majesty. Some servants must be secretly communicating with Ming, sire. - Whose servants are they? - Hyang! Yeong-sil... Where is he now? Maintenance Bureau: Office for palace facility repairs I won again. - How about another game? - No. I can't believe how big this is. How will we get the wheels on? Jeez. It's all because of him. Why blame Daehogun? His Majesty ordered it to be made with wheels to relieve the carriers. Still, Daehogun didn't have to build a house on it. I could live inside it. He tries so hard to win back His Majesty's favor. Mind what you say! He'd be well above you should His Majesty call him again. Take his side if you wish, but he's been here for over a year. I doubt His Majesty will call him again. What more would he want? Anyhow, there's been more work for us since he came here. - Look at all the clouds. - Sirs! Is Sir Daehogun here? - I didn't see him. - Why? What is the matter? There is chaos at the Astronomical Bureau! All the astronomical instruments are being taken away! - Sir! - Heavens! Put them down! You fools! Stop! Stop! No! What are you doing? Stop! - Sir! - Stop! How dare you touch them! They're His Majesty's prized instruments! Who commanded you to this? It's by royal command! What? The Ming envoy and the ministers are at the platform, sire. It's time to proceed, Your Majesty. Your Majesty! Sire! Your Majesty! Sire! Your Majesty! Stop! Unless His Majesty calls, you are ordered not to set foot here. General. Upon false royal command, His Majesty's instruments are being stolen, sir! You mustn't be here now! Run from the palace and hide at once! I must meet His Majesty today, sir! Why you! Leave immediately! - Sire! - Yeong-sil! His Majesty commands Daehogun to enter! Your Majesty! It's Yeong-sil! Why the commotion? Your Majesty! Someone falsely ordered the astronomical instruments to... I gave the command. For all of them to be burned. I ordered it. Your Majesty. There is much left for you to do, sire. I've realized everything I wanted. You've done enough as well, so rest in your old age. My hands do not know how to rest, sire. Then learn to rest. Your Majesty. Is it true an envoy from Ming has come to seize me? Am I a thief, sire? Were the astronomical instruments I made stolen from Ming? How dare you! Have I sinned in making what you dreamed of, sire? Yes, that is your sin. Proceed. Your Majesty! Your Majesty! If it is your wish, then I'll be a thief as they say. But please, sire... Please don't stop the astronomical research, sire! Your Majesty! Escort His Majesty. Your Majesty! It must not be stopped! Your Majesty! Please reconsider! Please, sire! Your Majesty! If you'll reject me like this, why did you tell me to look at the sky? Please! Your Majesty! Please... 20 years earlier, King Sejong's 4th year of reign Be careful! His Majesty will call for them soon! Hurry! Hurry along! I warned you to be especially careful with this book! With all the rain and snow on the long journey, how could it be intact? How about telling His Majesty that we couldn't get the book? Why you! I already informed him. We must restore it somehow. His Majesty has arrived! They were soaked by rain and snow, so they were redrawn, sire. My apologies, sire. - It must be a clock. - A water clock, sire. How does it work? Water falls and moves the pendulum to make a sound, sire. It makes a sound? Why are all these instruments on an elephant's back? The elephant, sire? Yes. Well... The water bucket is heavy, sire. It's easy for elephants to pour water, but their nose is long, sire. And the water can't be shaken, so that's why it is on the back. Whatever do you mean? Who drew this picture? Was it you? Your Majesty. A man named Jang Yeong-sil drew this, sire. Jang Yeong-sil? I do not recall the name. Who is Jang Yeong-sil? Who is he? Your Majesty. He is a talented slave I brought from Dongnae, sire. A slave? Yes, sire. Who is Jang Yeong-sil? Jang Yeong-sil! Step forward. Can you explain this picture? Answer at once. Your Majesty? If I may, the rice bowl drawn inside the elephant's stomach is what plays the role of a water clock, sire. When the water fills the bowl at fixed times, the bowl goes down, and that bowl drops a bead and hits the doll. - Then the doll... - Wait. Stop. Then can you make what is exactly in this picture? I cannot make it the same, sire. There is no elephant, sire. We have an elephant, too! - Chamberlain? - Yes, sire. Where is the elephant we received from Japan? It ate too much, so we had it sent to the countryside, sire. What for? For it to starve to death, sire. If we bring the elephant, can you make this? On second thought, we don't need the elephant, sire. Are you saying you can make it or not? Yes or no? Your Majesty. If I may, the elephant drawing is but an illusion, sire. In my humble opinion, I can make what's suitable to Joseon with our goods, sire. What if he really invents it? A mere slave can try, but never! 1 PM This is like the bowl inside the elephant, correct? Yes, Your Majesty. And this blocks the bead? Yes, sire. However, unlike the picture, this stick is raised by buoyancy to make the bead fall, sire. Now, make a proper clock. Yes, sire. How dare a slave set foot in here! Though His Majesty noticed you, how dare you! Forgive me, sir. Yeong-sil! Welcome, sir. Take this to His Majesty. Oh... Me, sir? Yes! Go at once. Did you bring it? Yes, sire. Open it. Yes, sire. Wear it. Sire? Why you... Chamberlains! Dress him. What in the world? But... What is this for? What is happening? As of April 14th, 1423, Jang Yeong-sil's status is no longer a slave. Pardon? He is now a fifth-class scientist. How can this be? Oh, my word... Your Majesty... Sir. Welcome. You're a fifth-class scientist now? Then shall I call you sir? No, sir. Tidy these books! You're one lucky fellow. Life is full of surprises. His Majesty has arrived! You may all be seated. Why have you deferred my order to promote Jang Yeong-sil? The caste system is the basis of Joseon. Please withdraw the order, sire. Yes, Your Majesty. Pardoning a slave so easily will remain an unjust case, sire. I'm giving a post to a skilled man for the benefit of this country. How can that be an unjust case? You've made a law to give vacations to slave couples who give birth, sire. Now, a post in court, sire? His lowly skills will surely bring forth greater trouble, sire! There is much debate on Your Majesty's close relations with a common slave. I worry that he may disturb Your Majesty's thoughts, sire. A slave is a subject too! How can a subject negatively influence the king? One's nature cannot be changed! Nature? If the commoners' natures cannot be civilized as you say, then why are you governing them? Is it merely to reign over them and enjoy the power? Yeongsang? What do you suppose? Your Majesty. There are precedents of brave fighters being pardoned and given posts. There is no reason Jang Yeong-sil cannot, sire. However, I think it would good to perhaps lower his rank, sire. Discuss a proper rank for him and suggest it to me. - Chamberlain? - I wasn't asleep... Yes, sire. I shall go to the Astronomical Bureau. Yes, Your Majesty. It is I, lad. When the disk turns, one of these dolls will automatically rise like this. How does this operate? It's designed so that a bead will fall like this every hour. It... It looks useful. Borugak... Call Jang Yeong-sil to demonstrate. Yes, sire. Jang Yeong-sil! Begin the demonstration. You heard. - Step forward. - Go. Hurry. For one hour, we will operate the Jagyeongnu and compare it to the sundial. Jagyeongnu: Self-striking water clock If the two clocks are the same, even after the sun sets at night, we will now be able to know the exact time with the Jagyeongnu. It's 12 o'clock, sire! It's 1 o'clock, sire! Yes! It's the same here! At last, the Joseon people, regardless of day and night, shall live by the sound of Jagyeongnu's bell! Be seated. Sit comfortably. Of all those stars, which one might mine be? If I may, I think the highest star, the Polaris, is Your Majesty's star. Silly! They say that star belongs to Ming's Emperor. To me, it is your star, sire. Then what about yours? I don't have a star, sire. Why is that? A born slave cannot become a star even after death, sire. I loved looking at the sky like this ever since I was young. As a king, I must look down all day. It is nice to have the sky to look up to like this. How about you? If I may, I also loved looking at the sky ever since I was young, sire. However, as a slave, I was punished for looking up. I held my head down all day, sire. But the stars... no matter how high I held my head to watch, they never scolded me, sire. Rather, it felt like they listened and whispered to me, sire. Your Majesty. I truly love stars. Now, lie down. Go on. See the star beside Polaris? That small star? The one over there. Yes, Your Majesty. From now on, that is your star. Your Majesty... How could a man of humble birth like me own a star, sire? Class does not matter. What matters is that we look at the same sky and share a dream. In my eyes, these countless stars look like my people. Yeong-sil? Yes, Your Majesty. I want you to make Joseon's armillary sphere. Yes, sire. I shall make it, sire. Due to years of poor rice harvests, the commoners eat barley instead. I had my servants prepare barley. When I traveled, I met farmers and heard that Ming's solar terms don't suit us, so they struggle with farming. Thus, I wish to precisely measure the solar terms that are suitable to our land. What do you ministers think? Your Majesty. The astronomical calendar of the sky belongs only to the Emperor of Ming. Though Ming's almanac may not suit us, as a son does not cross his father's will, Joseon must follow Ming, sire. Daesaheon. Daesaheon: Head of Inspections Our people are suffering. How could submission to Ming be our priority? Even so, Your Majesty, Ming will never give us their astronomical technology. How can astronomical instruments be made without Ming's help, sire? We can try to make them on our own. I shall put Jang Yeong-sil in charge of this. Great work! Be careful! Put it down slowly! Be very careful! No! Don't pull too much! Be careful! Not the small one. Hold the big one here. I said hold the big one! Oh, Your Majesty! Don't mind me and continue. But... Go on. My apologies, sire. That's not the one. Could you hold the big one? Why sure. Wait. - This one? - Yes, sire. - I see a hole here. - Yes, sire. - Put it in? - Yes, sire. It's done. That was perfect, sire! Why, thank you. - What's next? - Now, the smaller one... When will the monsoon end? I wish to go outside and play with this, but there are no stars. - Your Majesty. - Hmm? May I come closer inside, sire? You may. - Your Majesty. - Hmm? I shall show you stars, sire. Why, it is the Big Dipper. Yes, Your Majesty. - May I? - Sure. - Your Majesty. - Hmm? Please hold the lower part of this horizontally. - Then see the Big Dipper... - Sure. Do you see, sire? Yes, I can see! This is quite amusing! Like this. Incredible! Yeong-sil. I wish to see more stars. Yes, sire. I shall show you. Good. Why turn the lights off? Come and assist me. What is it? His Majesty is in the dark? Hold this candle. Lower yourself. Further down, please. Stay just like this. What is this? A royal command. What are you doing? It is the Big Dipper, sire. Chalawan. Eltanin. Your Majesty. This is Polaris, the brightest star. It is the king's star, sire. Where is your star? Right next to my star, so your star must be. I'm honored, sire. Latitude is 28 degrees! Latitude is 28 degrees! Longitude is 2 degrees! Longitude is 2 degrees! Your Majesty. Joseon and Ming's star maps vary by this much, sire. Hanyang is one hour faster than Nanjing, sir! Nanjing: Capital of Ming Well done. At last, we have our own time that suits our country! Congratulations, Your Majesty. Yeong-sil. Yes, sire. I must reward you for this. What is it that you wish? If I may, my wish is to always be with you, Your Majesty. That seems more like your reward to me. It is a great accomplishment. But Ming will soon hear of this. I'm worried about the consequences. Jang Yeong-sil must be separated from His Majesty. Sir? They will find out eventually. Why don't we tell Ming first to avoid further problems? 3 days before the accident Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Set it on fire. Follow the royal command! Set it on fire now! Joseon's subjects must not follow the king's command. Your Majesty! Please withdraw your command, sire! Your Majesty... Your Majesty! Sire! Your Majesty! Please flee, sir! Saheonbu guards are looking for you! Bring my tools. - Stop, sir! You must flee! - Hurry! Sir! Please leave now! Sir! Sir! Your Majesty! Please don't do this, sire! Did someone die? Daesaheon? Have I commanded you to seize Jang Yeong-sil? I did so because there was risk of him fleeing, sire. I shall ask again. Did I command you to seize Jang Yeong-sil? Your Majesty. For Joseon's safety, I believe Daehogun Jang Yeong-sil must be sent to Ming, sire. Please relent and consider our loyalty, sire. Please reconsider, sire! Father. This is the late king's robes. The blood of the late king's brothers-in-law, his two younger brothers, and countless other servants is on this royal robe. My mother, whose family was annihilated, said I was cursed to become like my father. That frightens me so. Hyang. I shall pass the throne to you. Please withdraw the abdication, sire! Please withdraw your order, Father! Please reconsider, sire! The crown prince has exceptional intelligence, but it is too soon for His Highness to govern, sire. If you insist, Your Majesty, your humble servants shall leave the court, sire. Please reconsider, sire. I feel unwell. I must go to recuperate at Icheon Palace. I shall discuss this matter with you upon my return. Hot springs? When Daehogun could be taken to Ming? Must we work like this in the middle of the night? What did you do? All you do is eat! What? What in the world? - Damn it! - What? - Why you! - Damn! What are you doing? You two are the same. I inspected everything. Let's go home. Come. Let us go! Finish up and go home. What is with the weather? Father. Please return in good health. Your Majesty. Please return safely. Guard? What is this sound? His Majesty departed for Icheon Palace. What? Why would His Majesty go to Icheon Palace now? Your Majesty... Why... We must send Jang Yeong-sil to Ming with the envoy! We need a royal command to send Yeong-sil away to Ming. As His Majesty is absent from the court, by law, we must now follow Yeongsang's command. Give the command, sir. I see what the king wants. Soft-hearted, he left the palace for us to send Yeong-sil away. Can you not see, sir? Don't get ahead of yourself. We must send Yeong-sil as soon as possible, sir. Please make your decision, sir. He could create something more dangerous, sir. Bring it inside! It was found in Jang Yeong-sil's room. We must find out what it is, sir. Pour me a drink, too. Daehogun. You know what this is, do you not? They look like letters or drawings to me. What do you make of them? Well... I do not know, sir. You've never seen this before? No, sir. They look quite unique. I don't know, sir. These were found in your quarters. I must know in order to help His Majesty. Are they the new letters His Majesty is making? I know nothing, sir. As you feign ignorance, they must be letters. If Ming and Joseon's upper classes learn of this, no one can guarantee the king's safety. Once you are sent to Ming, you won't be able to return. It is my name. Lee Do Hold it like this. Yeong... Sil. This is your name. Sire... They're letters. You can attach and detach them and write as the words sound. They're very convenient. - Your Majesty. - Hmm? If I may, I don't know what to make of it, sire. Is it difficult? Is this why you didn't call for me in so long, sire? - Were you disappointed? - Sire. As you haven't mentioned it to me, I reckon it must be dangerous. Ming and the servants wreaked havoc over the astronomical instruments. I only worry of Your Majesty's safety, sire. Then why did you make the armillary sphere? Was that not dangerous? If it becomes a fair world in which anyone can write, read, and learn, how pleasant would that be? It may be pleasing to you, sire, but it only seems foreign and awkward to me. Enough! It is my goal to make something eternal that no other country can take away. Please, sire. I only worry that you will keep me at arm's length, sire. Return to your post. I shall call you when it is time. Your Majesty... 1 day before the accident Sir! Daehogun! Be well. Sir! No! Please be well, sir! You mustn't go! Sir! You didn't do anything wrong. Let go of me! He did nothing wrong! Sir! The wheel is stuck! The palanquin is stuck! Push! Push harder! Push! One, two, push! One, two, push! Sire! Your Majesty! Sire! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! Please order us to death! It appears the wheel's axle has been tampered with, sire. Go to Hanyang at once and meet Cho Mal-saeng. You mean General Cho, sire? - Hurry. - Yes, sire! How could the palanquin break? It's a relief that His Majesty is unharmed. I hear General Yi is secretly headed back to Hanyang, sir. Isn't it odd, sir? Why not protect His Majesty but return to Hanyang? His Majesty said that you are the only one who can resolve this situation, sir. His Majesty's palanquin broke. Do you think someone might have done it on purpose? A palanquin made by Yeong-sil wouldn't break on its own. His Majesty stopped this old man from retiring. He must have a reason to keep me here. This is His Majesty's royal sword. I appoint you to head the military and give you 1,500 soldiers. Take this sword and seize Jang Yeong-sil. Ganghwa-do Government Office Untie him. Take it. It's your last night in Joseon. How dare you! You are ambitious. I've heard much about you even in Ming. A slave who has gained the king's favor with his craftsmanship. How dare you laugh shamelessly for a thief! What in the world is he gibbering? He says you're a thief. A thief? He looks like a cow thief. Who's calling me a thief? Don't even think about stealing what I made! I made what Ming couldn't. Don't claim that I copied it. If you do, I'll rip your mouth! Shut that mouth of yours! It'll take you people at least 100 years to make it. I'm curious to see what it is. What? You want me to show you? Very well. I can make anything with some chopsticks and planks. Damn greedy pigs. First, I'll set a stone slab as the foundation. Let's say this is a tank. I'll put it on the slab. When rain falls from heaven and fills this tank, I'll measure the depth, then calculate it with the time. Do you understand? Foolish imbecile. Of course you don't know. Wait. We just need the rain now. But there are no clouds. Musicians! Go on! We must make it rain! We must hold a rainmaking ritual! Play the music! That's it! It's raining from the sky! Sweet rain is falling! You bastard! Seize him at once! Rain from heaven can never be stopped! You fool! Aren't you afraid of heaven? Kill him! Do you wish to die so? Very well! I'll kill you tonight! What is it? Stop! How dare you! Put down your sword, sir! Do you not know who I am? Stop! All of you! General! Who ordered you to do this? Soldiers! Seize them and take them back to Hanyang! Yes, sir! They're bringing Yeong-sil back? Why are you surprised? His Majesty fell from the palanquin and could've been severely injured. Of course Yeong-sil should be suspected. His Majesty appointed General Yi to head the military. He also commanded me to thoroughly investigate this case. There is fault with what you say. With such important matters, as the one in charge of the court in his absence, he should've... Ordered you? But why bring in the retired general who served his father? Is that what you mean? Sir? The ministers of the court are afraid of Ming and haven't followed the king for a while now. What do you wish to say? His Majesty has begun to doubt the ministers. Someone has tampered with the palanquin's wheels. Whether it be Yeong-sil, who designed the palanquin, or the officials of the Maintenance Bureau, someone must be behind it. I heard you visited Yeong-sil in prison. You had a secret conversation with him? At such a late time of night, what did you two talk about alone? Sir? When the late King Taejong wore his black robes, remember the bloodbath in the court? Who are you? How dare you! What is the meaning of this? You fools! You? - Start searching. - Yes, sir! So, you're the one who delivered secret messages to Ming? I don't know anything, sir! Next, the Maintenance officials! Please! No! Jang Yeong-sil said the wheels weren't balanced, so I checked thoroughly, sir! You mean Yeong-sil knew beforehand? No, that's not it, sir! Yeong-sil told him there were problems with the wheels. Were you aware as well? I rarely spoke with Daehogun, sir! You rarely spoke with him when you were making His Majesty's palanquin together? That's why it broke! Hit him. Yes, sir! Who was the last to inspect the palanquin? I don't need to be hit! I'll say everything you want to hear, sir! Then speak. Well, if you would tell us first, sir... Then we can... You know, sir? Hit him. But... Wait! We are innocent! Don't do this to us! Brand him! Don't kill me! Ow, my legs! Did you hear him? He shouted, "We are innocent!" "Don't do this to us!" You did well! It was quite brave of you. What? You fainted! How did you hear that? I pretended so I'd get hit less. Why you! You must be weak from the beatings. Have some food. It looks like dog food. You don't want it? - Wait! - No! We're still alive. Let's eat. Sure. We should eat. I think, by the way things are going, the culprit has been decided. Who? It's Daehogun. Daehogun? He wasn't even there that day. How can that be? It doesn't matter. If they want to frame him, they will. So much for a nobleman. He wasn't one anyway. Daehogun. What are you doing here? We're all about to die. We've been framed for breaking the palanquin's wheel. This is insane! The wheel broke? Is His Majesty all right? Yes, he's unharmed. You should worry about yourself. Where are the culprits? They're in prison, sire. General Yi. Yes, sire. Call all the ministers to court at once. Yes, sire. General Cho, take the military and surround the court. Await my command. Yes, sire. Close the doors! His Majesty has arrived! Someone destroyed my palanquin to harm me. Who tampered with the wheel? What do you mean, sire? It's treason! General Yi! Enter! And the evidence? We found secret letters exchanged with Ming at Daesaheon's house. Also, at Emissary Yoon's house, we found 100 gold bars that you bestowed to Ming's envoy. I can explain, sire! As thanks for my duty to entertain, the Ming envoy gifted me that, sire! It's a precedent to exchange letters with Ming, sire. Who was with the Ming envoy when I said I'd abdicate? Daesaheon and Cho Sun-saeng, a maintenance official, were having a banquet with him at the Ming envoy's residence, sire. It is also a precedent to... You bastard! Leading the envoy to the armillary sphere platform and imprisoning Yeong-sil without my permission were all common precedents too, then? Was it you? Did you tamper with the wheel? Of course not, sire! Listen, Envoy Oyang! I know you fabricated the Emperor's letters and took more from Joseon for your own selfish gains. Return to Ming at once. Jang Yeong-sil will be punished according to Joseon's laws. Though you may be an envoy sent by the Emperor, you sided with conspirators and trifled with me! You could be executed by our laws. I shall return to Ming, sire. Your Majesty! Please believe in my innocence! For Joseon's future relationships with Ming... Daesaheon Jeong Nam-son! Are you a subject of Ming or Joseon? General Yi! Take him away! - Yes, sire! - Your Majesty. How can Joseon stand alone without Ming, sire? Do you think that it is impossible? I do, sire. What would come of this country if we go to war with Ming? You've always led Joseon by discussing with us and arguing with us over matters of the country. - However... - And so! You sided with Ming to embarrass and rebuke me! Seized my loyal servants! Burned my astronomical instruments! And if that wasn't enough, you plotted treason to kill me? Forgive us, Your Majesty! Please reconsider, sire! Please believe in our loyalty! Father! Please show mercy to them! Please withdraw your sword, Father! Please reconsider, sire! You mean no one is guilty and nothing has happened? Forgive us, Your Majesty! Please have mercy, Father! Very well. I shall personally interrogate Yeong-sil and the officials to find out who is behind all this! Rebuild the armillary sphere platform that has been felled, and never cross my will again! However, having our own alphabet is a different issue, sire. Lee Do General Yi. Yes, sire. I wish to be alone with him. Open the doors! Yeongsang. Do you wish for all to die? If you command, sire, I will be beheaded, and a bloodbath will unfold here. I know that well, sire. Do you not know why I'm doing this? Of course I know what it is you want, sire. However, look at yourself now, sire. You remind me of our late king. Is a bloodbath what you really want for Joseon? Did you not wish to govern with good will and reason? I dream of a country that can stand alone! Your Majesty. Making the alphabet is far from a hobby, sire. This is for the people! Being able to read and write is power to the upper classes, sire. If you give that power to the people, all the upper classes will turn against you, sire. Without their support, would you be able to make the country you dream of, sire? Your Majesty, I have a rough idea of what it is that you want. If you pledge to stop creating the alphabet, I shall make sure Yeong-sil is pardoned and reinstated, sire. It hurts as much as giving birth. As you're hit, hold your breath. Then breathe out. Take deep breaths. How many hits can kill you? 100 hits will kill you for sure. 60 hits will cripple you. If you faint after 80, you'll die. Hold it, then breathe out. If you get hit like that, you'll die after 50 hits. How do you know so well? I'm the main flogger. Bastard! As Joseon's founding contributor's progeny, you must know politics well. What is happening here? My connections told me His Majesty and Yeongsang discussed something behind closed doors. You've spent many years in the court, too. After years of hammering and drilling, my beard turned white without having done much. If you didn't do much, that means we just breathed. Until now, I thought my talents would save me. Now, the talent put me down in here. Let's just practice. General? Where are we headed? Your Majesty. I thought you had forgotten about me, sire. When I'm about to, you cause trouble like this. How could I forget about you? The palanquin was my doing. Your Majesty? Why did you do that, sire? I've become tired of Joseon and was about to leave. It was for the best. You're not going anywhere. The rain has stopped. Many roof tiles in the palace will need repairs. It is bold and strong. I knew it was your handwriting. My apologies, sire. No need. The alphabet you wanted to make, is it complete, sire? I named it "Jeongeum"... Jeongeum: Proper sound But I regret that I may lose you because of this. No, sire. Never. Your dream is to make all the people to be able to read and write, is it not, sire? Please do not despair, sire. What about your dream? I've realized all my dreams now, sire. Right. You made Joseon's own time and opened Joseon's heaven. You realized all my dreams for me. No, sire. If you didn't dream them, how would I have ever made them, sire? No, Yeong-sil. If you didn't make them, who would know I dreamed of them? Your Majesty. Why do you wish to go down the difficult path alone, sire? I am not alone. I have a friend like you. Your Majesty... Sire... Your Majesty... Yeong-sil. Leave Hanyang immediately. I packed some clothes and money for you. Live well in a place where no one can find you. Is this His Majesty's command? No. If I flee like this... What will become of His Majesty? Fool! Worry about yourself! Go on! Leave at once! Go! And do not look back. It's bigger than I thought! Hold tight! I'm just getting started! Started? You've been up there long! Why take so long changing roof tiles? You're so heavy! Where's Daehogun? - Hurry! - I'm almost done! What are you doing this late at night? If something is broken, we feel like it's our duty to repair it. Why fix it? Will you live here? Damn! We'll get flogged more for damaging it. Look at the stars! I might as well watch the stars. Good idea! Let's watch the stars together. Why didn't anyone tell us it is good to watch stars here? They get flogged to death here. Who'd be able to tell? Did you hear any good news? Someone said a world will come where nobles and commoners alike will be able to read, write, and learn freely. That's what I heard. A commoner learning to read? What son of a bitch said that? - What nonsense before I die. - Right. Look at all those brilliant stars! Why didn't I notice before? Daehogun? What is that star shining brightly alone there? That is Polaris. What a strong, bold star! It is at the very center and shines the brightest. It is the star I cherish the most. Your Majesty. Yeong-sil walked back into prison, sire. Now, you must renounce Yeong-sil, sire. His Majesty will question the criminals. Bring them at once. State the criminals' sentences. Cho Sun-saeng failed to supervise in making the palanquin firmly. Lim Hyo-don and Choi Hyo-nam failed to make the palanquin properly. By law, they must be dismissed and be flogged 80 times. Jang Yeong-sil failed to supervise the production of the palanquin. Thus, the palanquin wasn't built strongly. As the wheels fell and broke, by law, he must be dismissed and be flogged 100 times. Please give your command, sire. Your Majesty. Though Jang Yeong-sil is of humble birth, he created great inventions for Joseon. His achievements cannot be ignored, sire. Therefore, please exercise your privilege to hate the sin but not the sinner and pardon Jang Yeong-sil, sire. If Yeongsang wishes so... That's preposterous! A criminal who plotted treason must be punished! I did it! I broke the wheel's axle to harm the king! So release these innocent men at once! Daehogun! What do you mean? Did you really tamper with the palanquin's wheel? I did! Joseon's heaven! And Joseon's time! I made them! But the king took all the credit! There is nothing left for me! So I plotted treason! So kill me! Have you lost your mind? Of course not! I lived like a madman all my life, but I finally came to my senses! I plotted treason! Kill me! Enough! Stop. I shall ask you directly. Your Majesty! Did you truly plot to harm me? Yes. - I wanted them for myself! - No. Tell the truth! Did you truly try to kill me? Yes. I no longer have a king. Yeong-sil... What do you see? What do your eyes see, Yeong-sil? I see your country, sire. Please realize your dreams, sire. Yeong-sil... You've done more than enough. Jang Yeong-sil received 80 flogs in 1442. There is no further record of him. Two years later, Joseon's first astronomical almanac was compiled. The Korean alphabet was later made public in 1446. Directed by HUR JIN-HO
