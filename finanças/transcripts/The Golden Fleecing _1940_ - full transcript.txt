- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Watch where you're going, bud! - Oh, pardon me, I... - What did you do? - Now just a minute, boys! - Hey, let go of me, you're hurting me. You're murdering me! I assure you, I... I missed him. Give me a lift up to the phone, will you, buddy? Okay, okay... Hey, what is this? Hey, what is this, come back here! Hey... hey... came back! Fender Enterprises. Oh, Mr. Twinkle. And how is the bad bold salesman? Oh, Miss Hanley, I'm so sorry. I was delayed, traffic, you know. I'll be about three minutes late. Mr. Fender's about to leave, but I'll try to hold him. Oh, gee, I sure would appreciate that. Of course, I don't want to cause him any inconvenience, Do you think maybe I ought to wait until he comes back? Mr. Fender's plans for returning are not very definite. Oh, it's you. You can use a vacation, dear, you're getting jumpy. Who called? Your insurance outfit. That rover boy's bringing up the policy. - I guess I'll have to wait. - You can't, Gus, you haven't time. I got time enough for that. Anything happen to me, you're gonna need that policy. I'd rather have you alive, Gus. Think of what a swell funeral you can give me on fifty grand. Stop that kind of talk, it's bad luck. You sure you're not beginning to feel sorry? - About what? - Well, I'm not much of a bargain. The only thing that I'm sorry about is that I didn't meet you sooner. Express to the 12th floor, going up. Express to 12th floor, first stop, 12. - Seventeen, please, 17. - Twelve. Twelve. No, 17! Oh... excuse me, I'm in a terrific hurry... Big business deal. 12th floor. No, I don't want to get out here, I want to go to 17! - 17, please. - We're going down. - Oh, I have to go up! - What for, we're going down. - Oh, how do you do, Miss Hanley. - Hello. I was held up, Mr. Fender, but I have the policy right here. All you have to do is sign the receipt. - Gonna pay for the first premium, huh? - Well, I hate to talk about the money... Oh, that's all right, I came prepared. Thank you. Oh, here! - Oh! - Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt you? Oh never mind about me, you just take care of yourself. - You're worth $50,000 now. - Yeah, in a box. Gus, don't say things like that. - Watch your step. - Don't worry, I will. - There you are. - Thanks, very much, Mr. Fender. Oh, here, just a minute, the most important part. Well, I guess I'd better get on back to the office. You're sure you'll be all right without me? I'm sure you will, well... goodbye. Oh, boy, what a day! Where did you ever find a guy as dumb as that? It wasn't easy. Twinkle, where have you been? Twinkle! Hey! - For heaven's sake, are you going crazy? - Never mind Mr. Sloane's appointments, look. Henry, you did it! Signed, sealed and delivered, here's the first payment. Oh, boy, wait till Sloane sees that. I never could have done it if it hadn't been for you. Oh, of course you could, you're a natural-born salesman. Ah... Now there's only one more thing you have to do. - What's that. - Go in there and make him give you a raise. Oh, well... I couldn't do that, you see... Well, I haven't been with the firm very long, only a couple of years... If you don't walk in there this minute and claim your rights, I'm through with you. Oh, Mary, do you have to be so unreasonable? You heard me. Henry. Hm? Good luck. Twinkle! I'll see that Mr. Sloane hears about this. Never mind, pussyfoot, I'll tell him myself. Well, look here, Twinkle, since when have you... There you are. - What is it? - Just 50,000 straight lights, that's all. Well, good work, Twinkle. You'll be a salesman yet. Uh... uh... Mr. Sloane, there's something I wanted to... ...I wanted to talk to you about. You, uh... you wouldn't want to give me a raise, would you? A raise, what do you want a raise for? You're a single man... I know, but I'm going to be a double man, I... ...mean I'm going to be married, Mr. Sloane. Well, who is it, some jitterbug after your money? No, sir, it's Mary Blake. Oh, Mary Blake, Fanny Blake, Annie Blake. They're all out for the one thing. Mary Blake? - Yes, sir? - Mary, is this true? Yes, sir. Henry and I are getting married. Well, what am I going to do for a secretary? Well, I can't have my wife working, Mr. Sloane. - Well, why can't you? - Well, I... Henry's very strong-willed about these things, Mr. Sloane. Well, I guess you've made up your mind for better or for worse. I hate to lose you, Mary. - I hope you'll be happy. - I know I will, Mr. Sloane, and... Thank you very much for giving Henry his raise. Oh, he didn't. Pattington. Yes, sir, having some trouble, sir? - What is Twinkle's salary? - $35 a week, sir. - From now on it'll be sixty. - Sixty? Why, we've been trying to cut down the payroll, sir. Are you trying to tell me how to run this business? No, I wouldn't try to do that, sir. That's all. I know, but sixty... Um, maybe you'd better go in first and prepare him. Oh, don't be silly, Uncle Waldo's an old sweetheart, he likes you. He does? - Hello, Uncle Waldo! - Hello! Go on, Henry. We have something to tell you. Oh, I feel fine, thanks, how are you, Hank? We're going to get married! What? - I said, we just got the... - Well, you don't have to yell, Hank. Say, don't you think this would be a great time to bring out my song? Oh, Uncle Waldo, must you go into that now, this is a big day. Henry sold a $50,000 policy, I quit my job. All right, but I don't see any reason why he shouldn't know about my song. Do you remember "Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching"? Well, they stole the idea from me. The song called, "March, march, march, the boys are tramping." - Oh, is that so? - Yeah. - Would you like to hear it? - Oh, he doesn't want to hear it now. Oh... # March, march, march # # The boys are tramping # # Tramping through the fields and woods # # If we catch the enemy # # You will very plainly see # # That we really mean # # To catch them with the goods # # The goodie, goodie # # Goods # Well, how do you like that? - Very tuneful. - That isn't all, it's timely! Wait, I'm going to show you something, look here! War, battles, bombing all over the front page, nothing else. Why, it's a natural... Hey, wait a minute, Uncle Waldo, what's this? Gus Fender sought by police. What's wrong? Look, $25,000 reward offered for exposed racketeer either dead or alive. And I delivered the policy. Come on! Don't you know the first principle of this business? Why didn't you check on Fender's background? I did. He was the head of a big firm, and I thought... Oh, you thought, you thought! Why, the next thing I know you'll be underwriting clay pigeons. Don't you realize every hoodlum in town will try to shut Fender's mouth... ...before he talks with the prosecuting attorney? But the paper says the police expect to find him any minute. They'll find him all right, in an alley, with our policy sticking out of his vest. Now mark my words, we'll be paying that $50,000 claim within 24 hours. I'll try anything you say, Mr. Sloane, but I don't know what to do. Well, do something, don't stand there with ivy growing up your trunk! Bring him back alive, even if you have to hire Frank Buck to do it. - Yes, sir. - I'll be with you in a minute, Henry. - Um... Mr. Sloane, about that raise. - Yes, Twinkle? Well, under the circumstances I don't think I'm exactly entitled to it. Well, that's mighty right of you. Get out! I just know this is going to work out all right, Mr. Sloane. Once Henry gets his teeth into something, he never lets go. And in the meantime you'd like your job back, is that it? Well, if... you haven't found anybody. Get to work. Thank you, Mr. Sloane. Um... Mary, I was wondering. I mean, seeing the way things are, do you, um... Do you think it would be wise for us to get married? I mean, if anybody killed Fender, I'd be out f a job. It's up to you to see they don't. - Do you think I ought to buy a gun? - Oh, Henry! Hello, glamorous, here's your dream boy. Hank, you old tycoon, what's this I hear about a big raise? Congratulations. Thanks, Larry, thanks, I... Now that you're in the upper brackets, I've got a great little stock for you. Confidentially, the boys are planning a little pool. How many shares will I put you down for? Well, it really isn't definite yet, I mean... Well, that's all right, it'll keep. It may cost you a little more, but old Larry Kelly, the financial wizard will fix it up for you. Well, maybe in a day or so. Fine, I'll buzz you at the end of the week. How about some fish and chips tonight, cookie, or are you are you still holding hands with the insurance king? No, I'd like to have dinner with you, Larry. I'm absolutely free. But I was going to take you and your uncle to that chow mein place. You'll be much too busy. Uh... yes, I forgot. Well, I'll be seeing you. Now listen, Miss Hanley, you can save yourself a lot of grief. We'll find Fender eventually. But if you'll help us now... You know, Mr. Engel, you have the most beautiful eyes. Just like a spaniel. What's the percentage in fronting for a cheap crook? An attractive girl like you could do a lot better. Oh, Mr. Engel, not in front of the help. For the last time, are you going to tell us where Fender is? Yes, he's playing bean bag in a kindergarten on West Street. All right, you can go now. Thanks, see you again sometime. Don't worry, you will. What's the matter with you, haven't you ever seen a woman before? - Yes, sir. - Then don't stand there. - Put two men on her. - Two. Yes, sir. - Oh, Miss Hanley... Miss Hanley. - Oh, hello, Mr. Twinkle. - I want to ask you a question. - Is it about Mr. Fender? - Yes... How did you know? - I'm psychic. Oh, well, I'd like to know where he is. - Who wouldn't for the $25,000 reward? - It isn't because of that, but... ...my job depends on his not being killed. Yes, his life depends on it too. Well, if there's anything I can do to... to help you or Mr. Fender, I wish you... - Do you mean that? - Why, sure thing. Then you go straight home and stay in bed until you hear from me. Shall we nail her for speeding? We was told to follow her, not pinch her. I don't know. We're detectives, we ain't supposed to pinch people for speeding. - That ain't dignified. - Yeah? - Where's the fire? - There ain't no fire. - Well, let's see your license. - Oh, a jokester, eh? - Suppose I see your license. - Oh, I haven't got one. - Have you ever had one? - Sure, a couple of years ago. Ever been arrested for speeding? Lots of times, that's how I lost my license. Well, goodbye, nice to have met you. Hey, you're not going anywhere. Follow me. With all my heart. Breaking and entering. Assault and battery, Your Honor. Also he held up a gas station and picked an old lady's pocket. - You've been in jail before? - Only once, Your Honor. - For how long? - Twenty-two years. I was framed. - Any weapons? - Yes, sir. Don't you know you need a license to carry a gun? I had one, but it expired. Well, don't let it happen again. Case dismissed. - But Your Honor! - That'll do. Next case. What's your trouble? Speeding, Your Honor, she was doing 50 through the city limits. No, I wasn't, I was doing 70. You were probably thinking of something else. Oh, he forgot to tell you, I have no driver's license. Well, that can happen to anybody. - What's your name? - Lila Hanley. All right, Sibley, you can go now. But... Well, what are you waiting for? Follow me. Here she is, Mr. Fender. Hello, Lila, how are you? - Hello, sugar. - Hello, Gus. Alright, what are you waiting for, I'll ring if I need anything. Mr. Fender, did you figure on how long you're going to stay with us? Until I am good and ready to leave. Well, it ain't that I don't feel like having you here, but since you feel that you've got to have the jail all for yourself, all I can hand out is suspended sentences. Well, that's your headache, I like my privacy. Go on. Yes, but every crook in the state will be heading for Upper Tuxton. I've got my reputation to consider. Now listen, Reuben, with what I got on you all I gotta do is put in a phone call... ...and you'll be making brooms in Leavenworth. Now scram. Grab a chair, Lila. I'm sorry I haven't got a drink to offer you. I could use one. I've been dodging those gumshoe boys of Engel's all afternoon. Don't worry about those monkeys, they'll never be able to figure out this setup. What's the news, did you get any dope from the boys? I couldn't rake up a dime, Gus. Your name doesn't seem to scare them anymore. As if it ever did. Excuses, boss. That's alright, Happy. Fatso, you throw one more match at my foot, I'm gonna cut your heart out. Oh, I'm sorry, Happy, I meant to throw it in your hair. - You fat... - Alright, alright, break it up, will you? Oh, Hello, Swallow. What's the dope? Bad, very bad. If the law don't knock you over, it'll be some daffy peasant... ...with a shotgun and a yen for the reward. Now look, I hire you to keep me out of trouble, not to tell me how much I'm in. Without dough my hands are strictly tied. - I could raise some on my jewelry. - How much do you think? I don't know, twenty-five, maybe thirty thousand. - Not enough. - Well, how much do we need? - Fifty grand easy. - Fifty grand! They're sure to set bail at that figure. Then we'll need another five grand to get you into South America... ...with enough dough to sit around down there and wait till things blow over. That means we need another twenty-five grand, huh? What are we gonna do? I tell you what we're gonna do, we're gonna chuck it. We're gonna raise what dough we can on that ice of yours, take it and hop across the border. You'll never make it, Gus. You'll be in a coffin before you can use a gallon of gas. - He's right, Gus, don't try it. - What am I gonna do? Where can I raise another twenty-five grand? Say, what about that stock you gave me last year, Gus? We thought of that already. It ain't worth the paper it's printed on. The company's insolvent. Just think, a year ago I paid a fortune for that stuff. Don't try to tell me that stock market's on the level. - Here, take it. - I'll paper my bedroom with it. Well, Fender, where are we going to get the spinach? Better think fast. I'll turn you in and collect the reward. Yeah... yeah... anybody else I wouldn't trust, that's why I'm keeping these clowns here. Hey, wait a minute. - Why not? - Sure, it's an angle. Yeah, we'd get some patsy we can trust to turn me in, pick up the reward and we pay him off in the dark. Yeah? Where you gonna find a schnook like that? Oh, the streets are filthy with them. Some stupid slugger who wants to get his face in the paper. But he's gotta be two things, honest and dumb. Well, I'm glad you got your job back at least, Mary. Everything else has worked out so badly. Yes, I'll probably still be sitting here... ...when Sloan's grandchildren are running the firm. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Some nice young fellow liable to come along with a lot of ginger and... ...you'll get married and have a little home some place. Henry Twinkle, I could murder you! You've got every nice quality a man can have and you're driving me crazy. Don't you know a girl would rather have you anything but loving, and sweet and humble? Why don't you get angry sometimes, go out and get drunk? Get yourself a redhead. Yes? Yes, I'm sorry. He's here, who wants him? She says she's an old friend of yours. Me? - Hello? - This is Lila Hanley, Mr. Twinkle. - I've arranged for you to see Mr. Fender. - Oh, you have? Gee, that's wonderful of you, Lila... I mean, Miss Hanley. Oh, I'm not missing a word. Now look, I want you to follow these directions very closely. And above all don't tell a soul, not even your mother. First you go to the Third Street entrance. Your car... uh-huh... In the glove compartment? Oh, sure, I see what you mean. Oh, you bet I will. Okay. Goodbye. - Who was that? - Hm? Oh, well, I can't tell you. That is, it's somebody you wouldn't know. Well, if I have to go out for a while, fix it up with Pattington, will you? That was a pretty close shave, sonny. Oh, I could have stopped quicker if I hadn't been going so fast. It wasn't your fault, they ought to have an underpass here. But I was way over the speed limit. We don't worry about that in Upper Tuxton. There's a sign back there that says 25 miles an hour. That's just a decoration. Nobody pays any attention to those things. Aren't you going to arrest me? I was doing over seventy. Oh, no, you gotta kill someone before they arrest you in this burg. And then he backed right into me, Your Honor. - Almost cut me in half. - Never mind about that. - What's your name? - Henry Twinkle. Uh-huh! Well, Mr. Twinkle, don't think your going to get away with this. Making a mockery of law and order. Drunken driving, eh? - Oh, I wasn't drunk, I never... - That's a likely story! You're a drinking man if ever I saw one. - Why, I don't even like beer. - Don't you contradict me! I'm not contradicting you, but... I don't know what I'm doing here. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Well, my young friend, this is one jag you're going to sleep off in jail. All right, Sibley, you can go now. This way. Well, hello, Twinkle, come on in, come on. - Hello, Mr. Fender. - Glad to see you. Gee, I didn't know you were in jail already. Oh, this ain't a jail, it's more like a sanitarium, you know. Go on, bye-bye, Reuben. Here, I want you to meet Mr. Dugan, a friend of mine. - And, um... Mr. Werner. - Hello, fella. Now, you would like to see me stay alive, wouldn't you? Oh, I certainly would. My whole career depends on it. That's fine, now wouldn't you say that the best place for me to stay that way... ...would be the city jail, huh? Well, that might not be the most comfortable, but... It sure would be safe. Just what the doctor ordered, huh? I don't know, looks a little too perfect for me. Oh, no, no... Hey, look out! Hey, don't do that. What are you trying to do, burn my ace in the hole? - Sorry, boss... - Now look. I might be able to arrange it for you to turn me in on one condition. Yes, sir. That you hand the $25,000 reward over to me. Oh, that would be all right, Mr. Fender, all I want to do is keep you alive. Why, that's perfect, that's... Of course, um... If you should say anything about this to anybody, Um... I wouldn't be responsible for what might happen to you. - Oh, I wouldn't do anything like that. - And I don't mean just the police. Don't go home and blab everything to Mama. Oh, you can trsut me, Mr. Fender. I can be a regular clam if I wanna. Yeah, I can believe it. Alright, now here's your story. You... followed Lila to the park. Lila parked the car. I picked it up, you tried to prevent me, but I knocked you out. - You got that? - You knocked me out. That's right. Then I put you in a car, drove you out into the country, but you came to. And you socked me. He'd better make it look real. Yeah, that's an idea. Go ahead. Take a sock at me. Hang one on. You want me to really hit you? Hard? Go at it, hard as you can. Go on, hit him, sure. Come on, don't worry! Well... okay. What a sockola. Did I hurt you, Mr. Fender? You told me! Hey, where did you learn how to do that? Well, I used to teach boxing to the older business boys at the gym. Well, do you mind putting your hands down now so I can fix you up a bit? Well, stand still, will you? You gotta look like I put up a fight. I can't help it, I guess it's my instinct. Well, I haven't got all night. Go ahead, boys, take him. Say 400 to publish it, 350 for exploitation, and 200 for advertising, - That'll be, let me see... that'll be... - Oh, Uncle Waldo, aren't you dressed yet? - Yes, yes, of course I am. - Well, put on a jacket and tie. Why, I'm in my own home, ain't I? Yes, but tonight's something special. You don't want Henry to find you... Mary, look, I've been figuring it out. Now, if he can lend me $900 as a starter, I can get my song published, and double his investment in three months. Now you listen! Tonight is supposed to be a celebration... ...and I don't want you badgering Henry with your song. Now run along and spruce up. Well, don't you think there's a poss... You don't... I see... Well, never mind. March, march, march, the boys are tramping, Bump, bump... Henry! - How's my celebrity? - Uh... great. Oh, they're lovely. Thank you, thank you... Hey, pour yourself a cocktail while I put them on. Um... where's Uncle Waldo? Getting dressed. He'll be here in a minute. Um... Mary, there's something that you... Have you seen all those newspapers? Aren't they exciting? Sure, but... you see, it didn't happen the way the papers said. I really didn't do anything. Oh, Henry, stop being so humble. It's alright to do a little crowing. - You're a hero. - Oh, no, I'm not. Anyone could have captured Fender, I just happened to be on the spot. Success hasn't changed you a bit, has it darling? I guess that's why I really love you. Mary, do you mean that? Of course I do. Well, then I guess everything will work out somehow. - Work out? What's wrong? - Oh, nothing, it's just... Hail the conquering hero! Well, my boy, you certainly sold the show. Oh, nothing, really, I didn't do anything. Oh, by the way, have you made any plans about all this money that you have... Yes, we're going on a long honeymoon, aren't we, Henry? Well, fine, fine. Now watch that you don't fiddle this money away. Of course, if I were in your place, I'd look around for some good, sound investment. That's a good idea, Henry, we ought to call Larry about those stocks he mentioned. Stocks, oh, nonsense! Stocks! Just like putting it in a roulette wheel. Now I have a surefire business proposition. For $2,000 you can but 50% of the rights to a smash song. - Uncle Waldo! - Well, Mary and I are getting married and... I don't think we should start out by throwing our money away on songs. Songs? Why, this isn't just any old song. This is "March, March, March, the Boys are Tramping"! - You want me to play it for you? - No! I mean... not right now, I... I have a little headache. Well, you don't have to shout at him, after all. I wasn't shouting, Mary, I just don't think this is the time... ...to start beating on that thing. Thing? What's the trouble with that thing? It was good enough to support me for 15 years. - It's not supporting you now! - What? Gee, that's what I get for trying to help a fellow out. Why are you getting so worked up? You're not supporting my uncle. - I didn't say I was. - What's come over you? I've never seen you act this way before. I'm sorry, Mary. I have to explain something to you. A whole lot of things that... Explain what? Oh, what's the use? I was wrong before. You have changed. - No, I haven't, I just, um... - What is it, Henry? - Don't you feel we ought to get married? - Oh, it isn't that. Then what? Well, maybe it's because things have been happening so quickly. Last week I was just a little clerk going along and now I'm... - Now I don't know what I am. - Listen, Henry. Maybe I'm foolish to say so, but... I still love you. You make me feel as if I'm pushing you into this marriage. That's not true, Mary. I don't think I'm worthy of you. Oh, I can't stand you when you're like that. Either you're enough of a man to want me or not. Till you make up your mind I don't want to see you again. Hey, what were you doing up there all that time? Well, nothing, my girl lives there. Oh, you got a girl. I suppose you were shooting your mouth off to her, huh? Oh, no, I didn't tell her anything. I promised Mr. Fender I wouldn't. Button your lips if you want to stay healthy. Look here, Fender wants you to show up first thing tomorrow morning... ...at the office with that dough, see? - Nine o'clock. - Well, I can't make it. - What do you mean you can't make it? - Well, I gotta be at my desk at 9 o'clock. Gee wiz, I'm in enough trouble without losing my job. You're gonna lose more than your job if you don't show up at nine. Hey! You gotta be more careful. You know, you're liable to get hurt. Nighty-night. Don't forget, tomorrow at nine. Listen, Gus, I stuck my neck out plenty to get this visitors room for you. And you've got to keep these friends of yours in line. Don't worry, Barney, they'll behave. Mind you, no funny business now. Or they'll put you back in that cell and it'll be out of my hands. I said they'd be alright, didn't I? - Well, remember it. - Alright! I'll be seeing you. - Okay, he can go in now. - Thank you. - Oh, hello. - Hello, Henry. How does it feel to be a national figure? Oh, I don't know. I think maybe I'd be better off if I hadn't got mixed up in this. Never mind the smoosh, you got the dough? - Yes, sir. - Well, fork it over. - Well... - What's the matter? Mr. Fender, I'm in a difficult situation. - What do you think I'm in, clover? - No, but you've got to help me out. I helped you out. If it hadn't been for me... Now listen, Percy, we made a deal and this is the payoff. Nobody ever whetstoned Gus Fender. Oh, I wasn't going to do anything like that, I just wanted to explain. - I don't want any explanations. - Now wait a second, Gus. There's no sense in getting tough. He did help you out of a spot, now let him talk. Well, alright, what's the beef, go on. - Well, see, I'm engaged to be married. - Congratulations. Thank you. And, well, and you know how it is, you start planning a little home and a honeymoon... - You're breaking my heart... - Stop it, Gus, let him finish. And, well, my... Mary, that is, thinks I'm a rich man now. And I can't tell her the truth without bringing you into it. If I give you the money, how am I going to account for it? You mean you want to keep the 25 grand? Oh, not all of it, just enough so she won't get suspicious. I don't really care about for it myself, I know I don't deserve it, but... Gee, I hate to let her down. Now... isn't that just too bad? - You mean I can't keep any of it? - Not a dime. By gosh, this whole thing is your fault from the beginning. - Alright, boys, get it! - Now, wait a minute. Gus, you're all wrong, this kid isn't after the money. - That's what I'm trying to tell you. - All he's looking for is an out. You can't blame him for trying to square himself with his girl. Yeah, but I can't help him either. Either I get the dough and put up the bail or I do a stretch in the jug. I don't know about that. Here, this is what you did with the money. - What is it? - Stock, cost $100,000 last year. It's just a lot of paper now. Gee, Mary always wanted me to buy some stock. Well, then you're in the clear. Some spellbinder sold you a bill of goods. It could happen to anybody. Gosh, I guess it'll be alright. There's nothing else I can do. Except hand over the coin and beat it. Here's your check, Mr. Fender. A check? Well, what good is a check? If I try and cash that check, they'll know that this is a frame-up. - Gee, nobody told me to get it cash. - Well, I'm telling you now! Mr. Fender, I don't like your attitude. - I'm not working for you! - What do you want me to do, say please? Yes, I... I think so. Okay. Please. Very good. Keep an eye on that guy. - Hiya. - Oh, hello. - Got the scratch? - The what? The geetus, the dough. - Oh, yes, yes. - Well, come on. Gee wiz, you know, it's almost 12 o'clock, I don't know what Mr. Sloane will say. Look, would you take this to Mr. Fender for me? - Well... - Oh, come on, be a good fellow. You wouldn't want to see me lose my job, would you? - Okay. - Oh, boy, that's sure swell. I want you to know I certainly appreciate this. So long. Hi, Henry, old sock, did you nab any racketeers this morning? No. Is, um... anybody sitting here? Mary, aren't you going to speak to me? Oh, I know it was all my fault last night. Everything piled on me. - But it's all straightened out now. - What's straightened out? Well, everything that was bothering me. Well, that's fine. Mary, I... I took your advice this morning. - I mean, about the stock. - Did you? Hm-hmm, I bought a whole lot of airplane stock, $100,000 worth - A hundred thousand... - Oh, that's what it cost last year. You see, I got sort of a bargain. - That is, the man says... - How much did it cost you? Well, at a... it came to just the amount I had. - You spent all the money in... - But it's a wonderful investment. I mean, for the future. Why, the dividends alone. Well, we'd have a regular income that way. What dividends does the stock pay? Well, I don't know exactly, it doesn't say on the certificates. Well, I know how we'll find out, I'll phone Larry. Oh, I wouldn't do that. I mean, he might get sore because I didn't buy it from him. Oh, not Larry, you know him, he's an old friend. Larry Kelly, please. Hello? Hello, sugar, how's my little peach blossom? What? What's the name of it? Dividends? Listen, honey, the president of that outfit's on relief. Thank you, Larry. Well, um... what did he tell you? Can't you guess? The company's on the verge of bankruptcy. Gosh, Mary, I don't know what to say. Oh, Henry, why couldn't you have waited? You didn't have to buy the first stock that came along. Well, you know what the insurance business is, Mary. I'm bound to get another break. I certainly hope you do, Henry. Well, I've got to get back to work. I need this job. Stop wearing a track on the floor, you're making me nervous. - Well? - Did you find Twinkle? Yeah, I found him, He don't know from nothing. - He turned the dough over to Happy. - To Happy? Oh, I forgot. Here, the copper outside told me to give you that note. You know me, I don't pay no attention to coppers. Here, you read it, I could be dreaming. Dear boss, I figure twenty-five grand is fair pay for one slap in the teeth. So I won't be seeing you again. Goodbye and good luck, you'll need it. Your old pal, Happy. - The stock, where is it? - What are you talking about? - That Northeast Airplane stuff Gus gave you. - What's the matter? What's the matter, the government just loaned Northeast 3 million clams... ...to start production. It's the war. Don't rub me, Swallow, you mean to say that stock is worth something? Why, you lucky dope, it's going up like an elevator. Don't you understand, you're sitting on top of the First National Bank! I... (Babbling) Twinkle! Um... well... I know I'm late, Mr. Pattington, but I didn't sleep a wink all night... - You won't need this any longer. - Am I fired, what did I do? What did you do? As if you didn't know. What's Mr. McAvoy doing in my desk? Mr. Sloane wants you to have your own office from now on. - How's Mr. Twinkle this morning? - Congrats, Mr. Twinkle. Nice going, Henry, what'll I buy this morning? This is your office, Mr. Twinkle. And would you mind stepping in Mr. Sloane's for a moment? If you're not too busy. Come in, come in, my boy. - Hello, sir, hello, Mary. - Hello, Henry. Well, Mr. Slyboots, - Why didn't you let me in on it? - I don't know what you mean. You must have had your ear pretty close to the ground. How you knew Uncle Sam was going to loan Northeast that money. Northeast, what money? Oh, you had me fooled with that manner of yours. Still waters run deep, I say. You certainly caught the markets lightfooted. Can I see that, sir? "Captor of bad man turns genius of stock market." Henry Twinkle yesterday stole a march on the financial district. His profits are already in the hundreds of thou... How high did it go? A hundred and twenty-four. I just phoned Larry. Oh, you certainly play your cards pretty close to your vest, son. Why, would you believe that people have been calling the office since 8:30 this morning? They think you're lucky. They want you to handle their insurance. - Mr. Sloane, you're only joking. - No, on the contrary. I expect a nice volume of business. And you'll be needing your own secretary. Oh, really, sir... I wouldn't want that, sir. Oh, sort of a lone wolf, eh? Well, I guess so... I... Please, Mr. Sloane, I wonder if I could speak to Mary alone for just a minute. Why, certainly, if she promises to repeat any tips you give her. Henry! Now tell me the truth, did you really know yesterday? Oh, you mean about the... about the stock, hm? Well... don't you remember who this is? This is Henry Twinkle, - The man you're going to marry. - When? Right away. This minute! Oh, no, I can't, I promised Mr. Sloane I'd finish up the day. - Oh, you've been thinking about it too, hm? - I haven't thought about anything else. Oh, here, Mary, will you take care of these for me? Oh, no, I'll give these for Larry to keep. Alright, that's even better. - Well... I'll see you later, huh? - Where are you going? Oh... none of your business. You're not married yet, you know. For a man of your business genius, I advise this one. Oh... well, it looks pretty big. She has very dainty fingers, you know. Yes, Mr. Twinkle. But you can always exchange it. That's what your charge account is for. And how do you like the car, Mr. Twinkle? Oh, it would be fine if you had it in yellow. This is our smartest fur piece, Mr. Twinkle. Platina. Very nice. Is it all right if I don't pay you now? Rich men never carry cash, Mr. Twinkle. Like it, Mr. Twinkle? Timberlene, our latest shade. Alright, I'll take that too. And where to now, Mr. Twinkle? Mary Blake. I mean, 1824, Garson Avenue. Here we go. - Oh, my goodness! Jericho! - Yeah, wedding presents. - Well, which hand do you take, honey? - Oh, Henry! I'm sorry. - That was my fault. - Oh, no, that's alright, never mind. Here, look. Oh, Henry, it's simply beautiful. Yeah? Well, it's not nearly beautiful enough. Oh, you! Well, uh... you kids will excuse me if I hop into the next room and pick up my coat? Yeah... I thought you would. Are you as happy as I am? Oh, I'd be happier if I were good enough for you? Oh, you're the best there is in the world. That's not really true, Mary. Now there's something I must tell you. No. No, you never have to tell me anything unless you want to. There's nothing in the world that would ever make me stop believing in you. Alright, you beekers, you've got the next hundred years for that. We can't keep the preecher waiting, come on. Hurry up, we're late already. Take it easy, the preacher can't bring up the curtain till you get there. - St. Martin's, corner of Broad and Fifth. - Check. Hey, where do you think you're going? Don't argue with him, driver, we're in a hurry. - What's the matter? - I don't know. What's the idea of shutting me over here like that? Keep your trap shut, chum. That's alright, driver, I just wanted to say hello to someone in your cab. Henry! Who's that? Oh, it's a friend of mine. I mean, it's a customer, sort of. She used to be a redhead of some sort. - What does she want with you? - Henry, come on out. Henry, you stay where you are. Oh, I'll only be a minute. I'll be right back. - Hiya, Cookie. - Hop in, Henry, I want to talk to you. Oh, I can't, I'm in a hurry, I... What do you want? - Oh, now, don't be a mule, come on. - I'm on my way to be married! Get in, dope! Uh, look Mary, I guess we'll have to wait just a minute. You see, these people... Mary! Come on! Oh, now, see what you've doe. She's gone and I'll never get her back. Sure you will, she'll get over it. Oh, why don't you leave me alone, I did everything you asked me. Except one little thing. My stock. Your stock? You gave me that stock in return... That stock wasn't worth anything when I gave it to you. Well, that's not my fault. Maybe not. But Fender needs it. So, if you just hand it over, we won't keep it from your bride. But I haven't got the stock. - Where is it? - It's at the broker's. You frightened me. Well, you can have them sell it in the morning. Gus would rather have the cash anyway. Now listen, this isn't fair. It's partly Mary's, you know. I'm sorry, Henry, but I'm afraid you're out on a limb. And I don't think Fatso's in any mood to argue. Yep, you got a nice face, pal, I sure would hate to spoil it. Well... I'll try to explain it to Mary and if she says it's alright, I'll bring Mr. Fender the cash in the morning. We'll go along with you. Maybe we can help you explain. Wait a second, Fatso, you stay here. What's the matter, am I a stepchild or something? If I need any heavy-lifting, I'll call you. Say, why send it back right away? Why don't you wear it a couple of days? Well, who is that? What do you want? Oh, may we come in? I think these people want to see you, Uncle Waldo. Mary! Mary... Oh, Mary, please listen to me. Why, this lady doesn't mean a thing to me. She's Mr. Fender's, um... Fianc?e. Please, Mary, open the door and I'll tell you about the whole thing. I never captured Fender. He arranged it all and made me give him back the reward. I got into one lie after another, I just couldn't help myself. I never owned that airplane stock, Fender just gave it to me as a joke. - Now he wants it back. - Alright, Henry, get to the point. What'll I do about that stock, Mary? Mary, please, listen to me, you've got to answer me. I'll do whatever you say. I don't care what you do with it, only leave me alone! - Kind of a lovers' spat, isn't it? - Yes, love's very complicated. Yeah, yeah... Henry, I don't think you introduced me to the little lady. He never does. Come on, Henry, Fatso will see you home and tuck you in. Well, that's the works. Let's see, the last batch at 183, 183... and the other one's at 179. That's $176,214. We'll have your check in a moment, Mr. Twinkle. - Just a minute. - What's this? - An injunction? - Correct. That dough stays right here until your breach of promise suit gets settled. What breach of promise? Summons and complaint, issued in behalf of one Mary Blake... ...charging you with breach of promise to marry her. See you in church. Hey, hey, what... But she wouldn't talk to me, she wouldn't even answer the telephone. Oh, if they'd just let me out of this chicken coop for ten minutes, I'd fix that dame of yours, she'd drop that suit like a hot brick! Oh, Gus stop throwing your weight around, brute strength won't get you anywhere. What you need is bail money. Well, thanks, thanks for telling me what I need. If I wait for this suit to be settled, you know where I'll end up, don't you? Behind the jute mill! Keep your clothes on, we're not licked yet. When money's impounded through an injunction, you're entitled to an immediate hearing in a court of equity. - Talk English. - I mean, Twinkle can go into court... ...within 24 hours and try to get this injunction thrown out. - Where will I get a lawyer? - You've got one. Sure, this ought to be a cream puff for you, Swallow. Cheer up, Henry, we'll cook up something. You can always say this babe's a notorious woman... ...who's been after your roll for years. Oh, I won't say any such a thing! Oh, yes you will, honey, you'll say just what teacher tells you to say. I object, Your Honor, in the interest of my client, Mr. Twinkle, I think that... Mr. Swallow, as a court of equity, we can dispense with judicial procedure. We're simply trying to decide what's just in this matter. So perhaps it's best that I conduct the inquiry myself. Will the two principles please step up here. Alright, step up to the judge. Did you or did you not promise to wed this young lady? - Well... not exactly, I... - Yes or no? Your Honor, it's impossible for my client to give a categorical answer. - The circumstances... - Sit down! Well, answer me, we're waiting. Well... yes, I did. - And you accepted him? - Yes, sir. Did he later refuse to marry you? - Again and again. - Well, that was because I was... Yes, go on. Well, you see, one thing and another came up, They certainly did. One of them with a redhead on the way to the church. That was business, that didn't have anything to do with you and me. Maybe not, but we didn't get married. And you might as well know I sent your ring back to the jeweller's too. Just a moment, this is getting just a little too informal. Obviously, Mr. Twinkle, you failed to fulfill your obligation. That's all we're interested in here. And I see no reason why the injunction shouldn't stand. I don't agree, Your Honor. $176,000 is tied up in this action pending trial on an already full calender. My client may be grievously injured if he hasn't the use of that money. What immediate use do you plan to make of this money, Mr. Twinkle? Well, um... I, er... I hadn't thought. Mr. Twinkle, you seem to be in considerable doubt about your interest in this matter. He have an old maxim, "He who comes into equity, must come with clean hands." - The injunction will stand. - Thank you, Your Honor. Mary... Mary, won't you let me explain, I... Oh, Mr. Twinkle, you're back at last. Your telephone's been ringing for hours. - Oh, let it ring. - But it's from your office. Mr. Sloane said you were to call him. - I'll call him when I get good and ready. - Well, really? What's bugging you? And there was someone by the name of Blake. Been calling all afternoon. - What? What did she say? - Not she, a he. Waldo Blake, I think he said the name was, - You're to go over right away. - I am? Did he say anything else? Oh, I got other things to do around here besides being a message bureau. Running up and down stairs all afternoon. Oh, hello, Hank, have you seen Mary? Why, no, what's the matter? Oh, I don't know, it's the funniest thing. She came home ahead of me to fix dinner. And when I got here, she was gone and the door was wide open. Oh, she might have gone out to get something, to the store or some place. Oh, no, no, she wouldn't have gone and left her hat and her pocketbook here. I tell you there's something peculiar about this, I'm gonna call the police. - And look at that. - Well, what about it? Well, Mary doesn't smoke cigarettes and I smoke a pipe. I tell you I'm worried. It isn't like her. Well, someone might have dropped in to see her and she went out for a minute. That isn't all. One of the chairs was turned over and the room was in a mess. You know what I think? I think some of those funny friends of yours are mixed up in this. - I'm gonna call the police. - Wait a minute, Uncle Waldo, don't do that. Don't do anything. - Yeah, I took the party from that apartment. - Where did you go? Um... Reeves Building, down on West Fourth. - Reeves Building? - Sure, why? Nothing, just get me back there as fast as you can. Let's go! - Here, keep the change. - Hey, thanks a lot! Hey, you, where are you going? - I've got to get up to the 17th. - The building is closed, mister. How's it going, Martha? Now look here, Miss Blake, I don't like this sort of thing any more than you do. But as long as you're gonna be stubborn about it, we can't help ourselves. You can't frighten me and you know it. That money's tide up legally. Try and get your hands on it. Oh, why don't you quit chewing the fat and let me take over? Shut up. Now look here, missy, you're not being very smart. I can get you out of this without any body bruises. Well, what do you say, are you going to drop that suit or not? No, and you can't make me. Okay, you asked for it. She's yours, Fatso. - What's that? - Somebody's out on that ledge. Henry! Stay where you are, Fatso will take care of him. Hey, what's the idea, what are you doing out here? - I'm trying to get in. - Well, why didn't you come in by the door? The door was closed, I mean, the building was locked. Hey, look out! There, steady! - You could have broke your neck! - Are you all right? I guess so, I got a little dizzy. Well, brush yourself off and get out of here, we're busy. Hey, what's going on here anyway? What are they doing to you, Mary? We're just having a little talk with your girlfriend, that's all. Well, you could have talked to her at home, couldn't you? Well, it's more private here. They're trying to force me to drop the suit. Oh, gosh, Mary, why do you have to be so unreasonable for? Well, I hate to disappoint you and your friends, but I'm going through with that suit and nobody's going to stop me. - Oh, is that so? - Let go of me! Hey, what are you doing? - You keep out of this. - Let go of her! - Come on, Mary, let's... - Look out! This isn't filled with candy, kiddies. Now, Miss Blake, let's get to work. Pick up that phone and call your lawyer. Better do what she says, Mary. Come on! Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Hanley, I didn't mean to hurt you, I... And here's to dear old Hank, I always knew he got it in him. Well, they couldn't intimidate us, could they, Hank, old boy? Here we go! What's the matter, don't you like it? - Cat got his tongue? - He's mad... at me. - What for? - Because of that breach of promise suit. Oh, don't you see, darling, it was the only thing I could do, I had to protect your money from those people. - Why? - Why? Yes, why? Why do we have to make fools of ourselves in court? Why do you have to be kidnapped? Why do I have to climb seventeen-story buildings and... ...and take guns away from women? Because you're wonderful, darling. Because you're the bravest man I ever knew. Oh, I'm not brave! If you wanna know the truth, I was scared to death. Oh, don't you believe him, you should have seen the way he handled that big gorilla. Like a real hero. Oh, look, Mary, let's get this straight, I'm no hero. And I'm no wolf of Wall Street either. I'm just a guy that wants to be left alone. All I really want is a... is a steady job and a wife. That is, if you're still willing to marry me. Of course I am. Only we'll have to wait awhile now. Why? Well, don't you see, that's the whole point of the breach of promise suit, to keep those gangsters from getting your money. - Oh, I don't want the money, I hate it! - Oh, oh, wait, wait a minute! You're talking about something that I love. How can anybody hate money? Oh, don't you see, Mary, it's only dream money anyway, it doesn't belong to us. It belongs to Fender, I suppose? - Yes, it does. - Oh, Henry. Well, I'm having a nightmare. You've certainly changed, Henry. No, I haven't, I'm just tired of doing things I wasn't cut out for. Now see here, Mary, this is sort of a... uh... ultimatum I'd rather marry you than anything else in the world. But it's got to be my way. So you call off that injunction. We'll give that money back to Fender... ...and then we'll start right where we left off in the first place. Now, it has to be yes or no, Mary. Oh, Henry... No use, Gus, I did everything I could with the judge. He won't reduce the bail a nickle. Did you tell him what is liable to happen to him? Don't be a fool, Gus! She's right, this is no hick town justice. This is the law. Well, that's great. So. I'm still 25 grand away from South America. - Two people to see Mr. Fender. - I don't want to see anybody. Hello, everybody. How do you do, Miss Hanley? - Just fine. - What are you doing here? Hm? Well, um... Oh, I brought you this. Don't touch it, boss, put it in a pail of water. - What is it? - It's the money. The what? You'd have gotten it much sooner if you hadn't waved a lot of guns in my face. He's levelling, Gus, it is the money. Gus, you're a cinch, you'll be out on bail in ten minutes. By tomorrow, you'll be across the border with 150 grand in your kick. - How do you like that? - Oh, I like it. Is it all there? I counted it. Just a little more than $176,000. I make it $151,000. Oh, there must be some mistake. Mistake, huh? Yeah, a mistake of 25 grand. Come on, John boy, slip it to me, come on. Mr. Fender, you have $150,000 you never even expected. - Where is my 25 grand? - Mr. Fender, I assure you... I have it. Mary! After all I told you last night. But you're entitled to 25 thousand, that's the amount of the reward for catching Fender. But I didn't catch him, he caught me. But you deserve it. Mary, I don't want to keep any of the money. You're not going to keep it, you owe it. All the rings, and cars and furs... ...that you bought when you thought it was yours. Well, I'd have bought you those things anyway. You'll never get out of debt. All right, children, break it up. Now come on, I want my 25 grand. - Oh, give it to him, Mary. - No, I won't. Now, listen, babe, I want that... - Mr. Fender, don't do that. - Give me that 25 grand! I warned you, Mr. Fender! Okay, Fatso, get him. - I... I can't. - What do you mean you can't? Uh... he's got my gun. I didn't mean to hurt you, Mr. Fender, but... Well, I get sort of upset when anybody touches Miss Blake. We accept your apologies. And if Mary here wants to keep the 25 grand as you call them, Well, she's just gonna keep them, that's all. Boy, oh boy, what a man. Okay, Gus, the show's over. Keep your money, kids. Thank you, Miss Hanley. Come on, Mary. Well, goodbye, you all. Goodbye. Well, everything worked out okay, Gus. They'll get married and go nuts. We'll get bail and go south with over $100,000. You know, I think I smell something burning. Yeah. Oh, no! No, the money! - The pretty money! - It isn't fair. Fatso, I'm gonna break you of a very nasty habit. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
