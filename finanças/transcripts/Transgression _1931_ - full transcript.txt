Excuse me, madam. But if the luggage is ready. In a few moments, Morton. I'll ring for you. Thank you, madam. Lest you forget. How could I. What are you doing? Doing some more labels. Darling, I already did them. - I know. But you addressed 4 to Paris and one to Bombay instead of the other way about. I wasn't thinking of what I was doing. Maybe because I .. I wanted to make out five for Bombay. Darling, I wish you could. But .. well, for me .. It's as great an opportunity as any mining engineer ever had. For you. What with pack trains into the mountains. Hundreds of miles from civilisation. Rotten food. Natives. My dear, you couldn't possibly stand it. I shall miss you so. - Oh no you won't. After two or three weeks in Paris you'll forget you ever had a husband at all. Darling, that's cruel. Excuse me, sir. But there is not a great deal of time. You are right, Taylor. Ring for Morton. He'll help you with the trunk. Darling, let me have the labels. There you are, my dear. - Thank you. Oh, Taylor. Put those in one of Mr Maury's trunks will you. Good gracious, where did I put my keys? Here they are. You left them in the bathroom of all the place in the world. How about your husband's travelling rug? Don't you think he needs an umbrella? Do you think it never rains in India? You know, Robert. A lot of friends are leaving for Paris tonight. I don't think I could quite stand Honora with you gone. She is a bit touchy isn't she. I try to be nice to her but .. Oh good heavens, where on earth did I put the hat that I'm wearing. I don't think she likes me very much. I think you've been perfectly sweet to her, Elsie. She's just a bit jealous of you. You know .. Spinster sister and young bride. You've got all the things she would like to have. I know. I'm sorry for her. After all. She's looked after me and this house for twenty years. And then you came. Surely, when all's said and done I have a right to live in my husband's house? I'm not grumbling, my sweet. I think you've been wonderfully patient. Taylor. Taylor. Put this in the car. The trunks have gone to the station? - Just leaving, Miss. Are you going to the station without a hat? Probably you left that in the bathroom too. Did I? Yes. No. No I didn't. I know. How long do you think you will be away, Robert? I don't know, Honora. A year, perhaps less. I hope so. It seems a pity Elsie couldn't go with you. It is a pity. But wives are forbidden. Well, I suppose you know your own business best. But why the child wants to be gallivant off to Paris for, I fail to understand. She didn't want to particularly. As a matter of fact it was my idea. I thought she might be lonely here. To start with. A strange city is just as lonely as the English countryside. Or it ought to be if one behaves oneself. Not at all. We know people in Paris. Paula Vrain and lots of others. They'll look after her. If it comes to that we know people here. The Vicar, dear old Mrs Witherspoon. My dear Honora, why argue about it? I'm sending her to Paris. That's all there is to it. Well, I was there just once. Took a glimpse at their night-life. Then took the first train right back to dear, respectable England. Excuse me, sir. All ready, Taylor? - All ready, sir. Elsie .. Elsie. Oh, darling. I knew you would forget these, Elsie. Taylor. Taylor! We can just do it. Robert. There, there, there. Buck up, my dear. Robert! - Coming. Tr?s bien. Madame must have this. Must I? - Mais oui, madame. Alright. Do you know, Paula. You've changed since you left England. Your appearance. You're .. Everything about you is different. - This, madame .. To put on the face. And this one to put on the eyes. Oui, madame. London is very different from Paris, Elsie. You will find that out when you've been here a while. With this, your charm will be irresistible. Will it? - Oui, madame. Will madame have the eyeballs turned up at the corners or down? Well, I don't know. Paula, what do you think? Well it all depends which expression you want, dear. "Plaintive" or "penetrating". Last season, we were all "penetrating". But I am told plaintive is coming in again this year. Oui, madame. C'est vrai, madame. It is the fashion today. Well I guess "plaintive" has it. How attractive. Oh my dear! Your ears. What's the matter with them? - Something will be done about them. They are dreadfully pale. I know a doctor in Vienna who always uses tomato juice. Oh, oui madame. Jus tomate. Leave it to me, madame. I will fix it. I'll take this. - Merci, madame. Tr?s bien. Oh, but good heavens. I'm never going to wear it that low. But madame, you must really. Why with your figure, it would be a crime. Would it? - Vraiment, mademoiselle. Just right. Well, perhaps you know best. How do you like Paris? I adore it. I think you're lovely. Elsie, I'm proud of you. That's your third cocktail. When you first came to Paris you wouldn't touch any. I'm sorry. I like them now. Why, what are you sorry about? I'm pleased with you. You are a good pupil. I claim a little credit. - At what? As quite a good teacher. That's certainly true. Don't you agree, Marie? Certainement. Mon cher. You can teach anyone anything. - Merci. There is a testimonial. Remember it, madame. And I beg of you. Keep me well employed. Employed? Employed teaching you .. Paris. Madame. Madame! Entr?. - Telegram. Madam Maury. Tr?s bien. - Merci. Five minutes you may stay out, Arturo. No more. I've heard that when the condemned are ready for the guillotine. They are allowed exactly that. Five minutes. For their last farewell. Am I condemned? In exactly four minutes. You will vanish. Just like that. What an undignified exit. Even after last night? That ride in the dawn. When your lips for the first time .. Perhaps because of that. It all seems so ugly this morning. Ugly. It's never happened before. It's about time I made my husband let me join him in India. Just about time. I'm not going to give you up like this, Elsie. Three minutes, Arturo. Come with me to El Mirador. My lodge in Spain. Just for a few days. Oh, I beg of you, Elsie. I want you so much. Our little affair. Is over. [ Door knocks ] Entr? Julie. Bonjour, madame. Bonjour Monsieur. - Bonjour. This came a little while ago, madam. I did not know you had returned. S'il vous pla?t. It's from my husband. You see. I told you. The comedy has finished. He arrives tonight. So I'm to be thrown over, huh? But Elsie .. you never really loved him. I mean .. As you loved me. - No. In a better way. So, for a whole year, you've made me suffer. Suffer as I've never suffered before. - I've been wrong Arturo, wrong. A hesitating fool. Elsie, you don't mean ..? This is our goodbye, Arturo. You are cruel. Very cruel. Adios. Julie. Julie. Madame? Madame, what you do? Will you rest, madame. Please. No Julie. I can't, I can't. I must go out into the air, Julie. I must walk. Walk. No. Don't bother about that. Prepare my tub. - Oui, madame. And read that. Oui, madame. Oh, Julie. - Madame? Fetch me a cool gown. The blue one. Oui, madame. So, Mr Maury arrives today? Yes. Tonight. I am so glad Monsieur is coming. Monsieur is coming. Are you, Julie? If I may say so, it is not too soon. Pardonnez moi, madame. But I was so frightened for you. Frightened that one day you might take .. The handsome Marques too seriously. I was close to it, Julie. Make no mistake of that. It is not wise to leave. A beautiful young wife alone in Paris. Too long. Yes. It's a bad thing to be left alone. Time and again I wrote him, Julie. Begging him to let me join him in India. But no. Wives are forbidden. Well, don't worry, Julie. That's all over now. Madame. Let me get you some coffee. You are all breaking up. Dear, dear Julie. What would I do without you. Serafin. Get my bags ready. We are leaving for El Mirador tonight. Tonight, Se?or? - Si. [ French language ] Oui, s'il vous pla?t. Se?or .. I beg of you. Don't go to your home in Spain now. There is danger. The father of Se?orita Maria. He has been seen .. - You mean Carlos? Si, Se?or. Carlos. Hello, hello? May I speak with Mrs Vrain please? He has been seen plowing in the mountains near El Mirador. Oh, Serafin. Even fishermen may tire of the sea. Si, Se?or. He came a long way but for one purpose. All these fishermen are bad. Bad. No, Arturo. Listen, dear. Are you going to the Contessa de Longueval's luncheon? Of course. I never miss any of her roulette parties. Will you do me a favour? Get Elsie Maury to come. It is quite important. I will do what I can. Excuse me. Have you seen Don Arturo? I think he's in the salon upstairs. Thanks. Hello, Arturo. I thought I'd find you here. Paula, my dear. I'm so glad to see you. You look as beautiful as ever. - Do I? What have you there? Brandy and soda. - Mix me one. Alright. Here, have mine. - Thanks. Did you persuade her to come? She's coming. What did you mean, saying she was going out of your life and that sort of thing? It's her husband. He returns tonight. And I know that once he gets back to her I shall never see her again. You know it? Why, how can you know it? I feel it. Oh, Paula dear. I love her desperately. Oh, don't suppose from what I've said that Elsie and I have had an affair. No? No, indeed. She's been a bit .. provocative? She has been a model wife. I can assure you. Paula, I need your help. But you don't want me to adopt the immaculate one I hope? I am leaving for Spain tonight. I want you to come and spend a few days and bring Elsie with you. What about her husband? Well surely she can persuade him to allow her to spend a few days with you? Will you let me tell you something, dear? I think you are a fool to get any deeper into this affair. What do you mean? Elsie Maury is the sort to play around fire. Let her get burned. Will you take my advice .. And let her alone? Or will you have her on your hands for life? I'm only asking for a little happiness with the woman I love. Why look beyond that? Alright, old thing. I'll do what I can. Oh Paula, you're a dear. Do this for me and I'll be your servant for life. My dear, how nice to see you. Thank you. - Won't you come in? All your friends are here. Paula. You do mean to help me don't you? - I do mean to help you. Thoroughly. You are a dear. When are you going back? Elsie, may I have a word with you, dear? Are you really leaving for England without visiting Spain? Oh my dear, I am surprised. It can't be helped, Paula. My husband arrives tonight. Come now Elsie, persuade your husband to let you stay over a few days. And come with me to a house party. Arturo is giving at El Mirador, his home in Spain. It's only just across the border. I've told you, Paula. It is quite impossible. But my dear, you've no idea of the beauty of the place. On the top of a mountain. It seems the end of the world. Nothing passes down the mountain road. But a huge jingling mule coach. No horses. No motors. There will be guitars. Songs. Native wines. Oh my dear, it will be glorious. Have I made you see it? Yes .. I see it. Then come along. You take the train to Bilbao. I'll meet you there with my car .. Holiday time is over, Paula. I'm not going. I'm afraid I've failed. Arturo. I'm sorry. Now see what you can do. Think it over, dear. You will change your mind. I'll meet you at Bilbao. Don't forget. I left you rather abruptly this morning. Will you forgive me? One last dance? Please. Just to show that you've forgiven me. Will you? Monsieur Maury? - Yes. Pardon, Monsieur. This way, Monsieur. Mrs Maury is ..? Madame would certainly have never have gone out. She's gone out? She didn't dream of Monsieur coming so early. She did not expect Monsieur until this evening. No. No, I know. Did she .. did she leave any message? Well not a message exactly, Monsieur. She just said she was going to the Contessa Longueval for lunch. Oh, I see. Will Monsieur take a whisky and soda? Thanks very much. I'll make it myself. You don't happen to have any ice do you? Oui, Monsieur. Tout de suite. - Thanks very much. You will come to El Mirador with me, won't you? I can't, Arturo. I've told you why. But you must, dear. I want you to. If you let me have this Contessa's address I think I'll just .. Run over and get Mrs Maury. La Contessa de Longueval. Avenue Sagur. S-A-G-U-R. 116. 116. Thank you very much. Hello? Hello, mademoiselle. Donnez moi number .. Hello? La Contessa de Longueval? Find madame Maury. Bring her to the telephone. Toute de suite. Madame? Oh, madame Maury? Oui, oui, oui. Oui, madame. Imm?diatement. Oui, madame. Hello? Can you tell me where I can find Mrs Maury? I am sorry, sir. But I have not seen Mrs Maury. But if you will come this way I will look for her. No, Arturo. This is the end. Here and now. This isn't goodbye, Elsie. It can't be. But it must be, Arturo. I will phone at your home in an hour. Robert. How on earth did you know I was here? Your .. your maid told me. Oh, did she? Well, how are you? Why, I'm .. I'm splendid, my dear. I am .. I am just a little confused. This .. This isn't quite the sort of place I .. Perhaps we'd better go home? Shall we? Elsie. My wife. Heavens, but it's good to see you again. Yes, yes. Of course, darling. You are .. You are glad to see me, aren't you? Why, certainly. I just can't get used to it. That's all. What's the matter? Was I too rough? Well, you are a bit startling. Have you got a cigarette? I don't smoke cigarettes. Oh Robert, please. My maid Julie .. she's in the next room. - What does Julie matter? She is over age, isn't she? Elsie. What's wrong? You are different, Robert. You are like a strange man. I was just thinking the same about you. You've changed too. For the worse? - Oh, no. I don't say that. You are more .. What shall I say. Sophisticated. Well, remember I'm a year older. One must grow up sometime. Oh I see. A year older, eh? Is that why you put all that stuff on your face? Don't be stupid, Robert. All women use make-up nowadays. Well .. I don't like it. Well, my dear. You will just have to get used to it. Don't let's quarrel. We've just found each other again. By the way, I clear forgot. We shall have to dash back to London tonight. Tonight? - Hmm. But darling, I thought you'd take a holiday. Meet my friends, see the revues. - My dear, I can't. The board of directors is meeting in London tomorrow morning. I dare not miss it. It may mean a fortune to me. But I can't leave without saying goodbye to my friends. They've been wonderful to me. I'm going to be obligated to them. Besides, there is the packing. Pardon me, Monsieur. But madame cannot leave tonight so quick. There are six trunks. Six trunks? Not to speak of the hat boxes. Yes. I never thought of all that. That's right. - So you see .. I tell you what you do. You stay over .. until next week. I'll be tied up with the directors until then. You can .. you can meet me in London. And we'll go home together, hmm? Now, you get in something comfortable. We'll have a quiet dinner somewhere. In the meantime, I'll run down to the Portiere about my ticket. Robert. If you're sure you don't mind. It would be easier if I were to follow you in a few days. Mind? Of course I don't mind, my dear. Why should I? [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Por aqui, Se?orita. Good afternoon, Serafin. - Se?ora. Where is Mrs Vrain? I look everywhere for her but she is not here. Not here? She must be here. Do not be alarmed. Maybe Se?ora Vrain miss her train. And will come by the other route. Other route? - Si, Se?ora. There is another approach to El Mirador on the far side of the mountain. The Se?ora may rest assured . Se?ora Vrain will be there when we arrive. This way, Se?ora. How far is it to Don Arturo's home? You can just see it on the top of the mountain. We get there by nightfall. Se?ora must decide quickly. If we do not take this coach now .. We cannot get up this side of the mountain until tomorrow. Very well. We'll go. This way, Se?ora. Mi casa. What does that mean? My dear. That means my house is yours. And my heart is beneath your feet. All of that? Well, that's a free translation of it. Do you like it? - Oh, it's lovely. Perfectly lovely. Where is Paula? Paula is full of surprises. She is apt to come up the mountainside any minute. Good heavens, I had no idea it was so near dinnertime. I must hurry and change. My dear, you must be terribly tired after your long journey. Aren't you? Why no. I .. I'm not tired. Just a little frightened of the storm that's coming. I shan't be long. Serafin. Why bring Se?ora Maury up the mountain when you knew Se?ora Vrain wasn't here? It was to please you, Se?or. I always hope to bring about what you desire. Serafin. I don't believe that Se?ora Vrain ever intended to come. Se?or. For .. two? It will look better. Serafin. Things appear to be turning out. You'd better have a short vacation. A mule coach goes down the mountainside at midnight. You take it. Gracias, Se?or. I will telegraph you when I need you. Si, Se?or. My dear. You were never more beautiful. Only three? But the others? Haven't they come yet? I'm afraid there will be no others. Paula was to bring them but she's disappointed both of us. Se?or. Then .. do you mean that we shall be alone? Are you sorry? Arturo, I must leave. But Elsie, how can you? I don't know. All I know is I must go down to the village where we started. But that's not possible. The only thing that passes the house is a mule coach. Well, have us go down in that. When it arrives. Certainly. But very often it doesn't pass until morning. You mean to say that nothing goes down the mountain until the coach comes back? Only Eduardo on his donkey. Eduardo carries the mail. But I can't stay here. You must see that. I will go. Even if I have to walk. I'm sorry Elsie dearest, but you can't go. [ Thunderclap! ] Listen to the storm. Are you frightened of me? Why, no. Of course I'm not frightened of you. I trust you. Then perhaps .. you're frightened of yourself? Isn't it true? Isn't it? I don't know, Arturo. I'm like something that feels a trap closing down on it. What am I to do? I only came here to say goodbye because I wanted it all to end beautifully. Then let it end beautifully. Like this. No, no. Please. Elsie. Don't let's think of anything else. Say you love me. You do love me, don't you? Yes. Oh, Arturo. Love me like this, always. Always and forever. Carry me up. Above all in life. Above all the world. I will adore you. Arturo. This is not just an .. an adventure. I can never go back to Robert. He must know tonight. Mama Mia. We have not miracles. I must write him a letter. Telling him of my decision. That's only fair. Then I'd be satisfied. I'd be content with sending the letter. Until then, I'll .. I'll feel guilty. Little child. Very well then. Write your letter. Serafin. Hang out the lantern for Eduardo. The Se?ora has an important letter which must go tonight. Si, Se?or. Elsie. The storm is over. Well, have you made your confession? You have told him .. you are going to remain here with me? Always. That I am in love. Madly in love. You are the sweetest woman. I've asked him to divorce me. That letter should be sufficient evidence. Oh Arturo .. be good to me. Serafin! Serafin! Shall I .. seal it with my ring? Buenos noches, Serafin. - Buenos noches. La carta? Si. Si, si. Eduardo is here, Se?or. Wait a moment. Give it to me. Let me add just a few words. About how good he's been to me. I don't want him to think I'm not conscious of that. Well, if you don't want him to miss you and you want him to forget you. Write as you've written. Don't soften it, Elsie. But Arturo, I can't help .. - Very well then. We'll destroy it. No. No. La carta? La carta. Well? Let it go. Dear Arturo. With that letter gone. I have no-one but you. Come, Elsie. Dinner is ready. You have no regrets? No. I have chosen. The first kiss of your own giving. Do you know that? How beautiful. Everything as motionless as .. Arturo, look. What is it? - That shadow out there. It's moving. I don't see anything. It's gone now. It's probably Serafin looking around before going to bed. My dear, you are trembling. Well I .. I'm a little cold. Dearest mine. How I love you. How I want your love. Oh, Arturo. I'm so happy. So very happy. What are those? Old love letters. Now they mean nothing. Nothing. A wedding night without a ring? That must not be. Who are you? You remember me, Se?or Marques. We met only once. Last year at St Sebastian. When you came to steal my daughter Maria. Only. Sixteen years of old. Se?orita. [ Spanish language ] We will speak English, Se?or. This woman shall hear. It is well for you to hear this. As you are here this summer. So was my daughter here .. last summer. Please go, Elsie. The man is mad. If you've anything to say, say it now. - I have something to say. Last week. Your child. Maria's child. Died. And Maria. Maria died too. How much money? - Money? Do I want money? No. Elsie. Quickly, the gong. [ Gunshot! ] Serafin. Serafin. Serafin! [ Gunshot! ] Se?or! Muerto. Muerto. Is he dead? I beg him to stay away. But he come because he wants you here. Now he is there. Dead. Because of you. Then .. what that man said about .. Maria. It is true. That letter. I must get that letter. Serafin, I must stop it! Tell me please. How can I stop it? It is well on its way, Se?ora. The coach. The coach. Diego. Diego! Diego! Tell the driver to wait. The driver of the coach. Tell him to wait, Diego. Wait! The station, Diego. The station. Driver. We need to reach the station before Eduardo gets there with the mail. Eduard, Eduardo. The man who carries the mail. Si, Se?orita. Eduardo. Eduardo. Hurry please, hurry. Yes, Se?orita. It was impossible to make him understand, Julie. And when I got to the station it was too late. The letter had gone. And to think I could ever have been taken in by that braggart. To think that for one second I could have believed that his love was .. Was worth a brass farthing compared to Robert's. Poor madame. Madame, we all make mistakes. Monsieur Marques was always at your elbow. And Monsieur Maury was far away. That's no excuse, Julie. I tell you, I feel ashamed. Ashamed to think that I could have been swept off my feet by .. The first adventurer who came along with a pack of conventional lies. Are you sure Madame, that nobody saw you leave El Mirador? Quite sure. No-one but the driver. The coach was empty. - Good. So all that can be forgotten. Madame was never in Spain at all. But the letter, Julie? The letter I sent to Mr Maury that night. He will know the truth when he gets that. I've lost him, Julie. Lost him for ever. Listen, madame. There is still a chance. The Spanish mail is slow. Suppose you fly to England now? Today. Suppose you get there first. Before the letter. You mean ..? You mean I might stop it from getting to my husband? Oui, madame. Watch every post until it arrives. Then all you do is .. It's a chance, Julie. - It's a good chance, madame. Telephone the Portiere. - Very well, madame. Tell him to book passage on the first plane to London. Oui, madame. [ French language ] I shan't be needing the car this morning, Taylor. Very good, sir. What are you looking for, my dear? That book of Masefield's that I was reading last night. Perhaps Julie put it back on the shelf? Perhaps she did. Isn't that it there? Oh yes. Thank you. Elsie. You look a little tired, my dear. You didn't sleep very well, did you? Why, yes. Quite well. Tell me, Elsie. Be frank with me. Are you .. Are you unhappy? Have I seemed so? Of course I'm not unhappy. Separations are dangerous things, my dear. We've both changed. We have .. We've grown apart. It isn't too late to .. Start again, is it? I couldn't bear to lose you, Elsie. Robert. Be patient with me just a little while longer will you? Of course, my dear. Madame. It is nearly ten o'clock. The postman will be here soon. I know. I was watching the time. I'm not likely to forget. Oh Julie, I .. I can't stand this much longer. Can't stand what, madame? Every day now for the past week, I've .. I've looked through the mail. But why hasn't it come, Julie? Why doesn't that letter come? I have told you, madame. The mail from Spain is very slow. They can't be as slow as all this. Perhaps it's lost? - Perhaps, madame. Why, I never should have come back. I feel like a cheat. He is so kind to me. It isn't only for myself. That I want that letter. It would hurt him so. Poor young madame. Perhaps the letter will come today. Now go on or you will be late. Good morning, Thompson. Lovely weather this time of year. - Yes. Robert, I want to talk to you. - Oh? I want to talk to you pretty seriously. There is something extremely suspicious going on in this household. And you ought to know about it. That's very interesting. It is plain to be seen that you and Elise are no more than friends. Certainly, she is not a wife to you. I won't say that she's deceiving you. No. No, I shouldn't say that. But I do say that ever since she came back from Paris .. There has been something strange about her. What on earth are you talking about? I've been watching, Elsie. Watching her carefully. And not a single day has passed since she came back .. Without her making a point of intercepting the mail. Before anyone else could get to it. Look here, Honora. Did anybody ask you to spy on Elsie? Robert. There is probably some letter addressed to you that she doesn't want you to see. You don't like Elsie, do you, Honora. Oh, you needn't answer. I know you don't. She knows you don't. Well, I can't force you to. But so long as you stay on in this house. We'll have no more of this sort of nonsense. Is that clear? Quite clear. And Honora, remember. My letters are Elsie's to open and read. Whenever she chooses. Sit, Rex. Sit. Good boy. Rex, Rex! Robert, I know I'm not wanted .. But I shall do you one service whether you like it or not. Read this. What is it? It is from The Continental Daily Mail. It was sent to Elsie this morning. How do you know? Elsie left it on the terrace outside. And .. Well, anything printed in newspapers is for public consumption, I suppose. It is just possible you may know the woman it is about. It is my conviction that it will fully explain Elsie's remaining in Paris .. While you came home without her. I know exactly what you are hinting at, Honora. And my wife is not that sort of woman. I know it. Oh, Robert. I just heard a massive piece of news from Paula Vrain. An account of a man we both knew in Paris. Who was killed. He had seduced a young country girl and her father shot him. Oh, you have the clipping, Honora. Yes, I've been reading it. It speaks of a "dark woman" who was with him when he was shot. Was she a friend of yours too, may I ask? What are you talking about? You know very well what I'm talking about? You can't deceive me, young lady. You can deceive him because he's in love with you. But I am not so easy. You are being fooled Robert and it is time you knew it. Your only value here is your chequebook. Well, I've had my say at last. Honora, before you go you will apologise to Elsie. I will not. - You will. If you're to stay in this house. You think I would stay in your house after this? It's not the kind of house any decent woman would want to stay in. I will leave it as soon as ever I can pack. I'm terribly sorry. Terribly sorry, my dear. That's alright. Come in. There dear, don't let's think any more about it. Oh good heavens, I'd quite forgotten. Wait a minute, Taylor. This man insisted on coming down here this morning. I may have to ask him to luncheon. I say, have we enough food in the house? - Of course there is enough. Who is it? I've never met him in my life. He wrote to me: Se?or Juan Mendoza. His people have got hold of a mining concession that my people want to buy. Wait a minute, Honora. I must deal with the car, dear. Show Se?or Mendoza in will you, Taylor. You receive him will you, dear. I'll be back in a moment. Se?ora. You? Control yourself, Se?ora. If your husband .. - What do you want here? I am glad of this opportunity to see you alone. I was afraid it would be more difficult to arrange. What do you want? - Nothing that will hurt you. If you are sensible. By which you mean? - By which I mean .. You have never seen me before. Whatever you do, don't forget that. I have some business with your husband. Mining business. What can you know about mining business? - I have some friends who .. There are certain concessions your husband will make. If you will .. If I will keep your true identity from him? So that through him you may put over some dishonest deal? Honest or dishonest, Se?ora. I intend you shall use your influence in my favour. If .. If your business were honest, you .. You would come here under your own name. I shall tell my husband who you are the moment that he returns. And I will tell him of your little visit to the Marques at El Mirador. Do you think that can frighten me? He already knows. I wrote him. - Oh? I see. And after he received your letter, he forgived you, huh? Yes. Miraculous. You recognise it? Sure, it was handed to me. It has never left my wallet. So how could it be your husband reads it? You never gave it to Eduardo? No, Se?ora. You see, I was sure. The Marques would regret as soon as he tired of you. It would indeed be an inconvenient world. If all wives planning unfaithfulness would notify their husbands first. The other day it occurred to me. This letter might be useful to me. I have a price on it. - Oh please! Please give me that letter. Something in my heart will die if he ever reads it. No .. my price is .. Your influence with your husband. So that I may successfully put through my little business deal. I see. Now then. You listen to me. You can threaten me with a dozen letters like that before I let you cheat Robert. Oh, I've been wrong. I know that. This may break up my home. It probably will. But he shall know who you are the moment he enters this room. You refuse to be discreet? Very well then. I hardly think Se?or Maury would want the letter broadcast throughout England.

You thought you would keep the original, did you? Come on, hand it over. I am sorry, Se?or. But that is all I have. That's true, Robert. He hasn't the original. I gave my letter to Arturo to close and seal with his own ring. He must have put that blank sheet of paper in the envelope instead. Why yes .. I remember now. He burned some of his own letters that night. Mine must have been with them. I never gave the Marques proper credit for such originality. Get out, you! My felicitations. Well? What has put a tuck in your pretty little forehead now? What's bothering you, my dear? Robert. I must tell you what was in that letter. - Shush. No, no. I must tell you everything. Honora was right. I was the woman .. - Shush. No. But you don't understand. You don't realize that .. If it hadn't been .. - No, my dearest. That's all over. It never was. Like the letter that tortured you. Nothing. Noth?ng at all. Oh, Robert. What is it, my sweet? I love you so. T-G o?
