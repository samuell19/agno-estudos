According to my dad, in football everyone is allowed mistakes... except the goalkeeper. They're different from other players. They spend their whole lives standing there all alone... expecting the worst. Put that away son, your father will be here soon. Wait a minute. He said he was coming? No, and I've been waiting for ages. Don't worry, we'll be on time. No, he'll stay at his grandfather's. Bye, then. Come on, Mauro, your dad's here. Come on. Daniel, you're always so late! - I couldn't come sooner. - Come on Mauro, come on son. - Coming. - Got everything? Come on son, didn't you hear your mother? Just one more. Wait, let me position the goalkeeper. Go on then. Great goal! Let's go, hurry up Mauro. Come on, get the ball. Coming. Come on, get a move on! Dad, we won't be away long, will we? I don't want to fail my exams! Don't worry Mauro. Just a quick vacation. CITY OF BELO HORIZONTE 1970 Who should they put alongside Pel?? I agree with Zagalo, it shouldn't be Tost?o. You can't have Tost?o and Pel? in the same team. Dad, why can't Tost?o play alongside Pel?? Nonsense, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Look! While everyone else had doubts about the squad's chances... my dad was sure 1970 would be Brazil's year at the World Cup. But everything was so weird, even I started having doubts. Dad. I can't get to sleep. Me neither, son. Dad, we're bringing Mauro, all right? To your place. Yes dad, it's no use, we have to, ok? We'll be there soon. Bye. CITY OF S?O PAULO THE SUBURB OF BOM RETIRO We'll be back to fetch you soon. I don't want to stay here. We've already been over this, haven't we Mauro? But I don't want to stay. But my dad's expecting you, son. Son, please understand, we're not going because we want to. So why are you going? When are you coming back? For the World Cup. Everything'll be all right and we'll be back for the World Cup. It's ages till the World Cup. Now don't forget, we're on vacation... we've gone on vacation, ok? Let's go, Bia. Bia, come on. Hurry up! "Shit" to you too. What? Nothing. Who are you? What's your name? Mauro. What are you doing here? Nu, cat bit your tongue? I've come to stay with my grandpa. What grandpa? M?tel. Where's your mother? Your father? My father used to say grandfather was very stubborn and never late. Does it have to be today? Yes dad, it's no use, we have to, ok? We'll be there soon. Grandfather used to say my dad was stubborn and always late. But my mother said they were both stubborn... which is why they never met. And the one day my father arrived on time... it was too late! My dad was right... grandpa was never late, not even dead. I'll be right back, go on up. [What about the boy?] [The boy's at my place!] [But where's he going to stay?] [What about his parents? Where are they?] [Not here, not there.] [I don't know where they are.] [Be patient.] [What? But I want to know who's going to look after the boy?] Answer that. Answer the phone. I'll talk to some people, don't worry. Everyone'll help. [But I must talk to you.] Take it easy, the parents will call. Go back to work, please, answer the phone. And do something about the dripping water, for God's sake! What the hell do you think you're doing? Get down! Hey! Where do you think you're going? None of your business. I bet it's Shlomo's business. I have to get into my grandfather's apartment. There's such a thing as a door, you know. Very funny. Hanna! Hannale! Coming, mom! Don't be long. See Mr. Machado. He has the keys to all the apartments. Who? Everything all right, Mr. Machado? I'm sorry, I couldn't wait. The bris, you didn't do the bris! But I was desperate. You not Jewish! You're goy! Isn't there any milk? Cold? You eat fish in the morning? Eat up. It's good for the mind. Careful! No playing with matches. But I left my goalies at home. My chip! You broke it! Don't touch anything. I'll be back later. Come on, we're late. What a great game! He shoots. Everaldo passes to Jair... Brazil's playing brilliantly... the crowd goes wild. Jairzinho passes to Pel?... Pel? to Tost?o, Tost?o dribbling... he passes back to Pel?... Have you no respect? [And it's not my fault if his parents don't care about their son.] Tell the whole truth, tell them what you saw. [What truth?] [I'll tell you.] [The child is goy!] [But what happened?] [Isn't his mother Jewish?] [No! Only the father.] Send him to the orphanage! [That's absurd!] Not the orphanage! [He's M?tel's grandson.] If you think it's easy, why don't you ask the kid to live with you? Or you. No one wants to live with the boy. The problem isn't the boy... the problem is why his parents don't come back. The Rabbi thinks they're mixed up in politics. Really? [Daniel Stein turned Communist!] Don't be ridiculous. So now everyone's a Communist? Now you've gone too far! Daniel, M?tel's son, sent word that he's on vacation. Everyone understood? Vacation! And you, Shlomo, if God left the boy at your door... He surely knows what he's doing. Or have you forgotten the story of Moses in Egypt? [Moishale!] [Oh God, where is he?] [Where's the child?] Moishale! Moishale, come to bed! Boy! DOWN WITH THE DICTATORSHIP! Hey you! You're supposed to come and have lunch with us! Hi! How did you get in? Magic. Aren't you ever leaving? No! Never? Eat this pie my mother made. Palm heart, it's delicious. I'm not hungry. What's wrong with your hand? Can I see? A burn? How did that happen? God, how long since you had a shower? None of your business. My name is Hanna. I know. How do you know? I have to go. Eat some pie. Hanna! Do me a favor? Sure! Buy a Placar magazine and 20 packs of cards for the World Cup album? Everaldo's the only one I'm still missing. You and the rest of the world, Einstein. I think they forgot to print his card. You hungry, Moishale? My name is Mauro. What's this? Ruining the table? It's my table. My grandfather's. I'll do what I like with it. These are your parents, aren't they? Yeah. That's my grandfather, he fought in WWII against the Nazis. No kidding? And WWI, did he fight in that too? I don't know. What about football, do you play? Of course. Not that. In real life. I know. But do you play well? I'm in the school team! What school? Arcelino de Menezes State School. - I bet. - You bet what? I've never even heard of that school. Really? You'll see! Wow, you really are good! I have to go. Want to come with me? - I can't. - Why not? - I'm too busy. - All right. Hi! Change your mind? What about your parents? They're coming back to watch the World Cup with me. Wait, Mauro! Here she is. - You're late. - About time! - Stop complaining. - Who's that? This is my friend Mauro. Mauro, this is Boris, Caco and Duda, my favorite customers. Aren't you the goy? - And your dad's in jail, right? - No, Boris, he got out. Come on guys, cough up. In you go. Come on, go on. Come on, Mauro. - Scared, are you? - No! Come on, the first time's free! Come on, come on. Hurry! Come on, Mauro! You all know, right? Every man for himself, and no refunds. Two! Three! One! Like them, girls? This way, ladies. Girls, they'll try them on first, then it'll be your turn. - I want my money back! - That's tough. - Give me my money! - No! My mother's expecting me, I've got to go! Come on, Mauro! Come on, Mauro! I don't know, we'll see how the team gets on without Saldanha. Don't you think Zagalo's better than him? - Saldanha's crap! - He's a Communist! You think I give a damn about whether he's a Commie, Alfredo?! I'm worried about the team still being undecided. Hi! What'll it be? A water. Coming right up. Irene, help us solve this problem. Carl?o here doesn't think Pel? and Tost?o can play in the same team. Robson doesn't think Carl?o knows shit... What's your opinion? As if I knew anything about football! I think Carl?o doesn't know what he's talking about. - Even the kid agrees! - You live around here? You know where M?tel lives? The barber? He moved out. I'm his grandson. - But I don't know how to get home. - Wait a while, I'll take you. - You're Daniel Stein's son? - Yeah. I'm a friend of your dad's. - He's on vacation. - Yeah, so I heard. I'll take the kid home and be right back. - Okay, but don't be long. - Sure. If you need anything, just let me know. - Cool. - Bye. Bye. Mr. Ianis, I'll have a coffee. Careful. Go! - It's lovely, don't you think? - It's great. Hi Hanna! Hi. - Hi boys! - Hi Irene! Where were you? I went for a walk. Pass by the diner to watch the game, all right? Hanna, tell your mother I'll be coming to try on some dresses. Okay. She's old enough to be your mother! Come and eat Moishale! I'm going to have a shower. Where are there towels? In the bathroom closet. The water's cold! The water's cold. Good for colds. It's freezing! Too cold! Time went by, the World Cup was upon us and no sign of my parents. I suffered every day at breakfast and dinner at Shlomo's place. You're your dad's spitting image! But at least now lunch was somewhere different every day. - Leave the boy alone. - I will not! He's so thin, he needs to eat, put on a little weight. Rosa, bring the meat! Just look at that steak. Eat, Mauro, eat. Eat, Moishale! I'll give you Moishale! Who's this Moishale you keep talking about? Moishale was a baby the Pharaoh wanted to kill. To save him, his mother placed him in a basket on the River Nile. The Pharaoh's daughter found him and raised him. And when he grew and became an adult, he found his true mother again. But if I'm Moishale, who's the Pharaoh's daughter? What are you laughing at? Nothing. That day was a long time coming. Then one day it was here. On 3rd June 1970 the whole of Brazil ground to a halt. - I can't see! - One moment, please. If Czechoslovakia win it'll be a victory for socialism. Live from the Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara. I pity the Czech goalkeeper. Right in the first game he'll be up against Pel? and Tost?o... in the same team. Just like dad wanted. Mauro! Let's watch the game at the diner. - I can't. My parents are coming. - Leave a note. - I can't. - Leave a note! - I can't! - All right! TV working okay? It's started! Good. Come on, Brazil! Look, it's Pel?! No, move back! Go on, don't let him shoot. Stop him! Get rid of it, don't let him shoot! Goal! Goal! That's good, that's good. Czechoslovakia score! Come on, get it up there. That's it, Pel?. Go on. Foul! Hey, that was a foul. Goal, goal! Goal! Go on G?rson... that's it Pel?, go on. Goal! Godspeed Pel?! An amazing goal by Pel?, Saldanha! Go on G?rson. Jairzinho, go on, go on! Goal! It's all over. Victory for Brazil! - It's finished. You can sleep here Moishale. Mr. Machado lent it. Moishale... Moishale, I'm going away. Mr. Machado will stay here while I'm away, all right? Where are you going? Breakfast is ready. When will you be back? I'll be back soon, Moishale. Aren't you playing, Mauro? No. Look! Hold on. Take it easy! Stop pushing. Here's mine, Hanna! Whoever gets four will have to wait. Take it easy! Three. Two. One. - Was this the one? - Yes. - It's lovely. - Very pretty. And there's that other one you liked. - The green one? - Yes. - The one in the window? - Yeah. I'm going to help my mother, be right back. There's to be no noise. - Was that it? - Yes, that one. Just look at that color. - May I try it on? - Of course, try them both. - You think I should? - Why not? Oh, I don't know. - What a fright, Hanna! - Hi Irene! - Wow Irene, - Get out the way, Hanna! ...you've a great body! - Thanks. - What's that noise? - It's nothing, Irene. They're fixing a couple of things out back. I see. Who brought my goalies? Have you been to my place? Moishale... I need to talk to you. Go on, sit down, please. Moishale, I've been to Belo Horizonte, to your house. - Do you know a Mr. ?talo? - Yes. - Where's the student's union? - Upstairs, first floor. Exactly, exactly. Hi there! Just look who's here! How are you, kid? - You know each other? - We met the other day, right M?rio? - Mauro! - Mauro, Mauro, that's right. I know his father. Have you come to watch the game with us? - May I? - Sure, come on, sit here. You shouldn't be here, you know that, especially with the boy. Think the game's starting? Let's watch the game! In Guadalajara in Mexico, an earthquake of joy and happiness! It's starting everyone! Take it easy. So, everything okay? England kick off. Just look. S?o Paulo is so big there are people from all over the world... supporting every possible team. Hi Irene, any idea where ?talo is? Over there. Shlomo is a Polish Jew. Now he's always talking to ?talo, who's of Italian descent. Look, it's Irene's boyfriend. Irene's dad's Greek. But her boyfriend... - He's here. - Now we'll win! ... I think he's the grandson of an African. For the classic match in Bom Retiro the Italians had more talent... but the Jews had a secret weapon. Cheat! The referee's cheating! Go for it Edgar, go on! It's yours! Save it! And suddenly, I knew what it was I wanted to be. I wanted to be black and fly! Mauro in goal, currently the best keeper around. It's starting! Go on, shoot! Goal! Tost?o number 9, another goal for Brazil. I came to see whether you might give me some information... to help find these boy's parents. I need your help father, please. - Shlomo! What are you doing here? - How are you, Dino? I need to talk to ?talo. Nothing? Rivelino shoots, goal! Goal! The 44th minute of the second half, the Brazilian goalkeeper has... gone wild, Mauro dribbles past the entire opposing team! He's about to shoot... I should have known better. Goalies mustn't leave the penalty box. Mauro, wake up! Keep your eye on the ball! Get the ball, man! You idiot, Mauro! Pain in the ass! Typical Jew. Typical what? Wow. How much do you want for Everaldo? He's free. Happy birthday. But my birthday isn't until October. Come on, Moishale. Come on, it's time. Let's go. Mauro, no! Let's go. Come on, kid. You take care, champ. Who's there? Oh shit! Have you been shot? Not shot, beaten up. Want me to fetch a doctor? No, no, don't fetch anyone! Go over there, go on. But does it hurt? Come and sit in here. There. - Stay there, I'll be right back. - What? What? Hi. Are you hungry? Did you make all this? Yeah. Cool. Thanks! Is that fish? Eat it... it's good for the mind. Have some coffee. Can you play table football? Mauro, I'm hardly in the mood for games. You're just scared. Great save! That's not fair, you moved! Yeah, before though. Get into goal. Direct free kick. ?talo, do you know anything about my parents? Where they are? Your parents are on vacation, right Mauro? Yeah, vacation. Mauro, there are loads of people on vacation like your parents. But will they come back? Sure they'll come back, of course they will. See who it is. Don't say I'm here, okay? Go! Go! - Is Geromo in? - Who? - It's Cheromo. - Shlomo? Is he there? - No, this is M?tel's place. - Must be next door. - They're looking for me. - No, they said Shlomo. Keep your voice down, Mauro! Those men are from the police. The game's over, see? They're taking Shlomo! What are they going to do to him? Aren't you going to do anything to help him? There's nothing I can do, Mauro. I'm going to have to take a vacation too. Rabbi! Rabbi! - Moishale? - Rabbi! It's Shlomo... - Moishale, take a deep breath. - They've arrested Shlomo. Moishale, you're very young, go back home... and I'll see to this. Turning Communist at your age? Are you related to the girl? Did you bring a toothbrush? This is going to take a while. Brazil, Brazilians! It's the final of the greatest of all World Cups! It's Italy against Brazil! The ones in white shorts are Italy. Is Pel? there? Blue VW Beetle, blue VW Beetle. Blue VW Beetle, blue VW Beetle. Come on Mauro, the game's starting. - Blue VW Beetle, blue VW Beetle. - Come on. The German referee blows the whistle, and they're off. Come on Mauro, it's started. Has it just started? Sit here, champ. Pel? passes to Tost?o. Tost?o to Pel?. Go on Tost?o, go on Tost?o! - What's up, Mauro? - Hi. - Excited about the game? - Sure. - A lot or not much? - Average. - Get that ball out of there! Brilliant save by F?lix. Fantastic F?lix. At least it's exciting, wouldn't be the same... - without the excitement. Tost?o passes to Rivelino, Pel?! Goal! The Italian steals the ball and passes it down the right wing. Goal! Mauro, it's Shlomo! - Where? - In the taxi. Goal! Moishale. Brazil is winning. That's good. Come with me. I went to the diner to watch the game. Pel? scored the first goal, it was awesome. Tost?o took the corner, Rivelino passed and "psssss!"... Pel? scored a header. Dr. Doitche. Hi mom. How I've missed you, son... missed you. What took you so long? Where's dad? Your dad's always late, isn't he son? Always! Look up. Now one for us. According to my dad, in football everyone is allowed mistakes... except the goalkeeper. Save it! I wonder if he had any idea I'd become a goalkeeper? Or maybe he already knew. Come on, son. Close the door, Moishale. Mauro! Your ball. You keep it. Happy birthday! And that's what 1970 was like. Brazil won the World Cup for the third time. And without thinking about it, and not really understanding how... I ended up becoming what's called an exile. I think exile means having a dad who's so amazingly late... he ends up never making it home again. THE YEAR MY PARENTS WENT ON VACATION Subtitles by LeapinLar
