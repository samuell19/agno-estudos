Welcome to Radio Karnival! I'm Valdemar do Amaral the Eyes of the Karnival! This is the Karnival's monument. We're at the epicentre of the festivity! Of the madness! Bla bla bla! Bla bla bla... bla bla bla! That bla bla, happiness and emotion who you, my dear listener, will feel at home through the voice of yours truly Valdemar do Amaral... Where's the Media Center? Are you kidding me? This Carnival will be very tiring! There will be a lot of people around us so we'll be confined to a small working area. So, you can start with a Master-Shot in the beginning but your main purpose is to shoot me in close up! I always blink an eye in the end and say something funny to soothe my speech, to cheer up our audience a bit... like the way the Other Guy does... And first of all, we should avoid that annoying reporters! Specially the See-Mee Tee-Vee anchor, Anita Bettencourt... I can't stand her! We should also avoid those clowns from the other TV channels and the guys from Spit TV! We should definitely avoid them! Here! See... Belly... And then... close up! Hum? - Right, boss! Let's do it again! Come on... Let me shoot the lady's jacket... You shoot me here! Try it out! Try it out! Here! - Everything OK, boss! Then I say something else about the Carnival Some ideas about what is the Carnival and what it isn't the Carnival... Then let the clowns make their job and... Excuse me! Sweetheart... The time has come... You will marry me otherwise I'll sue you... ...for abuse and exhibition of the prettiest and sexiest girl of the Torres Vedras Carnival. Me between the boobs, right? Good! They're not my kind of boobs anyway... We have to shoot everybody... Got it? Master-shot! It makes a nice frame! It makes a very nice frame! I think we should also shoot the Carnival Parade, don't you think? Ok, great idea! But then we won't have the boobs in the shot... Good evening! Thank you all for your presence here! This is our Carnival Community. This celebration happens every year thanks to you. We have the duty to perpetuate Carnival and make it better year after year. Since this year we'll celebrate Valentine's Day during Carnival, the Carnival's theme is Love! Behind me is the Carnival's Monument... quite allusive to the theme! Everyone's invited to visit our monument from today on and never forget that life lasts two days only but Torres Vedras' Carnival lasts six! Have fun! DELIRIUM IN LAS VEDRAS Is it recording? Hello my people! Good morning Lisbon! Torres Vedras Carnival is coming to town! The Torres Vedras Carnival is visiting the capital of Portugal! We're in Lisbon with a special convoy from the Torres Vedras town and my dear and esteemed colleague Ermelindo, from TV Culture... will interview the Mayor of Las Vedras. Mr. Mayor, what are you doing here in Lisbon? The SALOIOS came to Lisbon to visit Mr.President! The Saloios? The SALOIOS from Las Vedras! What is the speciality of Las Vedras, my dear Lord? The speciality of Las Vedras? - Mr. or Mrs. King? - Mr. King! - Mr., Mrs., all the same... - As you can see by the... furniture... - Oh sure, the Lord's horn! It's fairly common to say that in Torres Vedras, during the crazy days of Carnival, some people appear to be wearing the horns of a cuckold? - Hmm... Maybe...! - It's possible my Lord? And Your Highness, you think so? - It can happen! That's the result of the folly in Las Vedras... the King brings a cuckold horn with him! Every year it's expected that the Carnival's Royal couple come here to reign Portugal and that the presidential couple goes to the Carnival of Las Vedras. - Yes, we hope so... 5 minutes later... You didn't get to talk with him? - Our president is not a Carnival fan. Breaking news: The president didn't receive Mr. Mayor! - Not even through the back door? - He was feeling unwell... - Oh, he was feeling unwell! - I've got the perfect drug for him! When the President feels the taste of Carnival, he feels nauseous! The dices may roll in Vegas But Carnival rocks in Las Vedras The dices may roll in Vegas But Carnival rocks in Las Vedras "School of life"? You're Krazy! You're talking bullshit!

Take a look on the objects and you'll easily understand: organic relaxer, and some oil to grease yourself! Our bestseller! - Which body parts should I grease? - Any you want my darling! This one we use to coitus interruptus... - That's it?! - Yes... we're just meeting the main requirements imposed by the Government! How did you do it? - The artist is my sister, not me. - Your sister did it? - Yes! - Wow! What kind of art is it? - It's Pop Art! We're at the school! The King and Queen just arrived! Hurrah Torres Vedras Carnival! Hurrah Las Vedras! Hurrah! You should learn from me! So ladies... What happens in the crazy Carnival nights? ...I'm really interested on the feminine side of it.

Have you heard about the Lines of Wellington? This is one of the fortresses! Everybody went up here masked, and that's how we took out the french army. They got scared of us, and fled from the castle! Where have you learned such things? - It's a joke you moron... The Lines of Wellington, where the brave anglo-portuguese defeated the french-fries army. This castle was super, hiper, mega important in all of those battles!

Carnival! The best of Portugal! Las Vedras Carnival is starting with the Children's Parade! The huge popularity of TV Culture! It's not my popularity... It's the channel's... How important is Carnival for you? Oh, no. I'm from nearby. Wait a second, I'll call you back! I'm being interviewed by someone I admire a lot! It's the channel's popularity, not mine! Las Vedras Carnival is... What can I say? It's amazing! Are you from Torres Vedras? - No, I just work here. I'm an hairdresser! An hairdresser? Of course you are! Thank you! See you later! A Torres Vedras hairdresser who doesn't live in Vedras and takes a bus every single day to go to work in Vedras. That's how it goes around here for this people... That's what Carnival is: Pure happiness! Everybody on the same vibe! Oh no... Meanwhile... Dear spectator of this uncanny film. Here comes a man, with curly hair and a microphone and he opens the door... That's me, folks! Sir, what are you doing here? I swear I've never seen you before What is your name? Do your passion inflame? I'm Valdemar do Amaral, the great reporter of Karnival Radio! Nice too meet you. I'm Artur Moraes from See-Me Tee-Vee. You know what? I think your channel needs more rhythm. You lack hip-shake! I made a jingle for this year's Carnival, it goes like this: The dices may roll in Vegas But Carnival rocks in Las Vedras! Don't you like this lovely tune? I love it! You know what? I think you need to be more Dynamik! Like this! I'm trying to save your TV channel! Otherwise it will... It's going down... It's going down... You will sink the cathodic boat! Karnival Radio!! Thankfully you're here! Shall we come in? - I'm your beloved host on See-me Tee-Vee and I've got a great-mega-super surprise for you! What's his name? - Marley! Sometimes we call him Marlene Wow! He's letting his tongue hang out! Tongue in, Tongue out! Let's go! See-Me Tee-Vee will show you Marley in a glorious close-up! - How do you feel the joy of Carnival as a Torres Vedras' citizen.. Carnival is great but then after, 40 days without meat?! Who can handle it? When did you came up with this idea of masking the dog? Marley is not wearing a mask! It's his own style, he loves it! He goes to Paula's, the hairdresser, by himself! He asks for a brushing, or a mise. Marley takes the money with him and pays for the haircut! Be happy! Yes... I think we can make it... more appealling and entertaining at the same time. No! That's too much! I can try to convince her but she'll never be totally naked. Well, we're not gonna spend the day with these clowns, right? My ears are burning! I need earplugs! I'm not getting any younger! How low can you go? Is this my destiny? - Do you want to meet a dancer? - Humm... A young girl from Las Vedras... Cut! Cut! Edit this after! I've had enough... My ears are burning! Find me the make-up girl! Where is she? - She had to pee, sir. Do you want me to call her back, boss? No, I want you here and keep quiet... And blow your nose! Oh no, more of that "Peace &amp; Love"... Thanks, boss! The huge popularity of TV Culture! Delirium... in Las Vedras! Delirium... in Las Vedras! So, who am I addressing to? - Emilia! Emilia, I'm Stoned Sid from the punkest channel in Portugal, Spit TV! What do you think about this year's Carnival? Carnival the best thing of our lives! And Saint Peter is on our side! We're back brothers! Love is in the air! We can even smell it! These are the future artists! Art is Freedom! Is the Carnival forever? Yes! Sweet! They're full of good vibes! This Youth is full of energy! Fighting for Freedom, Anarchy and Love! Awesome! You're disguised as firemen, right? - Soldiers, man! - Oh, soldiers, I'm sorry! Down with the Carnival! - What dude?! What is your problem? Karnival is Anarky! You're an asshole! But, Donald... I just can't do it! This Carnival thing is not my style! With this kind of people? They are all clowns and lunatics! I'll do it, but I'm gonna do it my way. But this is disrespectful to my years of work, to my standards! This is a State channel after all, for God sake! Carnival? Instead of presenting a prestigious cultural programme? And my colleagues? Why should I join them? They are just like the other clowns, but worst! I'm not on their level... Ok, ok... I'll do it. I'll do it because you pay me! If I want to have a nice pension retirement' I have no choice, right? Ok, Donald... It's fairly common to say that Carnival began 500 or 600 years BC Getting its popularity since 6th Century AD. And it was... the meat's delight before the Easter. This was the first meaning. Then it turned into a kind of "goodbye" to meat, to the flesh the last days to eat meat until Easter comes. Bla bla bla... Bla bla bla... I need a paper with this shit! I need to memorize this... Carnivalis! The last chance to eat meat Or... Carnivalen! There's a lot of terms. But the thing is to enjoy the meat's delight before the Easter. Today is the day one of Las Vedras Carnival and the theme is the Love. A perfect match for the days of love we're living all over the world! TV Culture! An interesting TV! Las Vedras Carnival! Carnival! Carnival! Carnival! Good night Las Vedras! Moving on with this live coverage: take a look at this beautiful pair of horses! Your honour, enjoy the Carnival! It's the rumbling sound of love, That's the way the drum sounds!! It's the rumbling sound of love, That's the way the drum sounds!! What's the criterion to choose the King and Queen of Torres Vedras Carnival? It's not a logical choice! Any good reveller can be the King or the Queen! This year it's us but we'll probably renounce at some point... We have this thing here in Torres Vedras, that VIP's are not allowed like from soap operas or TV shows, to be the King or Queen of the Carnival! - We totally agree! That's the right spirit! It's a coup! The Republican President will make a speech to their subjects! For five days the Republic will hand over the city government to Monarchy... Let's listen the speech: To all Male and Female Confreres... Male and Female Nobles... Male and Female She-Machos... Delirium... in Las Vedras! We're live for Cool TV! What's the expectation to this Carnival? The expectations are sky high! Like in any Carnival! - Oh yeah, sky high! - Sir, we heard some rumours about lack of grant... Will this be the last Carnival edition? - No, no! This is the last Carnival... of 2015! In 2016 we'll rebirth! It's our way since 100 years ago... - 100 years? We're like a phoenix!

Why you call it burial if the King will be judged first? Because he will certainly be buried! Buried? What sort of judgement is that? He behaved quite badly during the Carnival... People ask him to run this smoothly and he doesn't... So why you need a trial for? It's just a fake thing for the papers, to make it seem a fair ending. I see, that is very portuguese-like justice... Sure... We're in Portugal, aren't we...? Would you consider a lighter penalty, like electronic ta... No! Dead and buried! The King is going to die! The King is going to die! Don't cry, mam...
