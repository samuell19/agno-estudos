-You just may be the nicest thing that's happened to me in a long time. You know that, counselor? -Maybe we ought to get to [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] -Oh, I could stay here forever. I'm afraid of what my kids will do to the poor sitter. Nobody's putting any pressure on. We can be together as long as it was good for both of us. No long-term lease. -It's nothing to do with that. -Well, then, what is it? Huh? -Hello. I'm Kyle Richards. -Oh, hi. We've been expecting you. I'm Lauren Michaels. -Nice to know you. -I'll tell him you're here. -Thank you. -Yes, Lauren. Good. I'll be right out. You're still contagious. No sexual contact with anyone until it's cleared up. -Isn't there a chance I could have picked it up any other way? -No, I'm afraid not. You married? -Uh, no, no. I'm single. And there's, uh, nothing you can give me? -No, I'll prescribe something that will help with the symptoms, maybe even shorten the outbreak. Other than that, there's not much I can do. Hello, Kyle. -Steve. -[INAUDIBLE]. Give me your name again. -Uh, Tolbert, Ned Tolbert. T-O-L-B-E-R-T. -You from around here? -I'm just here for the summer. -OK, Mr. Tolbert, get this filled. Follow the instructions I gave you and call me if you have any further problems. -Uh, what is this stuff? -Acyclovir. It's very new. -Would you like us to bill you, Mr. Tolbert? -No, I'm going to pay cash. Thank you. -Thank you. -Oh, I see you've met Lauren. She'll help you get settled. Have you found a place to stay? -I rented an apartment. I haven't seen it yet. -Well, if you have any problem, get in touch with Dave Fairmont. He heads up most of the development that goes on here. -Well, I don't need much. I'm sure it'll be fine. -Well, go through the files, get familiar with the patients. -Starting with him? -What about him? -Acyclovir. -Isolated case. One of the summer people. Oh, by the way, the local paper wants to do a little profile on you. -Steve, that's the last thing I need. -There's no need to get into that. Just a way of letting [INAUDIBLE] know who's filling in for yours truly. Have you had a chance to look around? -A little. -Hardly what you've been used to at St. Matthews. -I want you to know I appreciate this. -Don't worry about it. -You must have taken some flack. -Yeah, you're not the most popular guy in the American College of Surgeons. Lauren, I'm going to run over to the club. I'll be back before I take off. Relax, enjoy your summer, Kyle. -Thank you. -We've got to get things moving here. We're selling Paradise Isle, not downtown Philadelphia. We're set apart from the mainland. We don't have pollution, filth, traffic, noise. That's what this place is all about. It's clean. It's pure. It's a better way of life. Now Ned, the word in the ad copy is paradise, all right? Can you remember that? Frank, I want a list of all of our clients. Every deal we're even close on. Hi. -Darling. I well have you know that I have just demolished this [INAUDIBLE] adolescent six-two, six-love. Who says I can't play with the kids? -Not me, heaven forbid. I bet you let her win, didn't you? -Well, actually, Dad, she was quite a tiger. -Oh, I just saw Lisa Corwin. She was looking for you. I told her to go down to the courts. -OK, well, I'll see you both later. Bye, Mom. -Bye. Well, you can say goodbye to your daughter's undivided attention. Those two have a whole year's worth of gossip to catch up on. -Wait till you see how Lisa's grown. I'm afraid she'll have something to gossip about. -Dave. Joanna, you're looking radiant as usual. -Steve, I thought the rainbow trout would be an endangered species by now. -I'm on my way. I just stopped by for a last update. -Hmm. Want to be depressed? Come on, I'll show you the figures. I'll see you later. -What about the new units? Any movement? -No, it's still too early. -Jack Walsh thinks we ought to come down $20,000 on the base price. -Oh, forget about it. That's a big mistake. -Well, just a suggestion. -I'm sorry. Look, Steve, I know you've got as much tied up in this as anybody, but this is the wrong time to start lowering the price. It's like holding out a big sign saying, condos in trouble, get them cheap. -OK, you're the developer. Only some of the guys are getting a little nervous. [INAUDIBLE] want you to think about. -Come on, Katie, give. I want the Billy Hildebrandt story, every luscious, incredible detail. -Oh, come on, Lisa. [INAUDIBLE] There's nothing to tell. -Nothing to tell? Nothing to tell, Kate. That's not what you said in the letter you wrote. Shall I quote, "I think this is it Lisa. He's the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me." Hey, this is [INAUDIBLE], your best friend, remember? I thought we were supposed to tell each other everything. -We broke up. My gosh, Katie, I'm sorry. What happened? -[INAUDIBLE]. Bring it through. Good. Again. We'll try one, huh? -OK. -All right, keep it level. Good. Good. Again, come on. -Oh. -Not bad. I'm so embarrassed, really. -No, no, don't be. Look, by the end of the summer, you'll have Billie Jean King thinking twice about her comeback. -Come on, Tommy, I'll buy you a drink. -The dragon lady's waiting. But I'd like to. -Your loss, Mister. -Whoa. Really. Why don't you schedule toward the end of the day sometime. -How about Thursday? My husband will be on the mainland on business. -Yeah, how about Thursday. I'll rearrange the schedule. Oh, Mrs. Gillman. -What are we having? -What are we having? We're having macaroni and cheese. -I hate macaroni and cheese. -So do I, but it was on special. -[INAUDIBLE]. Not much these days except you and you. [CRYING] Oh, oh. Oh, all right. OK. I'm coming. I'm coming. It's all right. [PHONE RINGING] [INAUDIBLE] your sister. Hello. Yeah. Uh, I can't talk to you right now. Uh, Friday night. No, I'm sorry I can't. I can't get a sitter. No, I don't want you to do that, really. No, it's not that. It's just that I need some time to think. Derek, please, I can't talk right now. -Bartender. Bartender. Hey. -Something tells me I can get his attention easier than you. What would you like? -Scotch and water. -What's in it for me? -Whatever's in that glass, and the underlying gratitude of a thirsty man. -That's the best you can do? -I'd like to [INAUDIBLE]. -I'm not wearing a [INAUDIBLE]. -Uh, Pal, this lady and that seat are both taken. -Hey, Tommy. Tommy. -Kyle. I don't believe this. What are you doing here? -I'm subbing for Steve Holliston. -Here? On Paradise Isle? -That's right. -Hot damn. I thought you'd own the Mayo Clinic by now. -I thought you'd own Wimbledon. -Well, you give me time. Hey, you see this guy sitting here? I mean, this guy saved my career. You know the scar I've got on my elbow? Yeah, I told you about the time I beat [INAUDIBLE]. This guy totally rebuilt my elbow so I could do it. This man's a genius. -He's exaggerating. Actually, I'm only a virtuoso. -Hey, you here with anyone. -No, I just came in to grab some dinner. -Well, hey, come on. There's got to be someone here for Kyle. Uh, how about Sally? Sally would like Kyle. Sally. -Hey, hold it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you going to do? You going to order my dinner for me, too? -Hey, in this place, not even the cockroaches eat alone. -But just the three of us, all right? -Listen, don't you let his mild mannered exterior fool you. The doctor here and I have done some serious partying together. -Thanks, Lauren, will you excuse us now? I asked her to leave, because what we have to talk about is strictly confidential. I won't tell anybody. You're my patient. I respect your right to privacy the same as I would anyone else. What you have is genital herpes. There's no cure yet, but it's controllable. And with understanding, you can lead a perfectly normal life. Katie? -There's no cure? -It's a virus, Katie. The symptoms go away, but the bug sort of hides in an area near your spine called the sacral ganglia. Sometimes it flares up again. We don't know exactly why. -You mean this is going to happen over and over? -Not necessarily. -I heard that you can get cancer. -Your chances of getting cervical cancer go up, so it's important to get more frequent pap smears. -What about having babies? I heard that they can die or they can become retarded if the herpes if from the mother. -Well, that's true, but it's rare. And it doesn't have to happen. It should never happen. If the mother knows she has herpes and is having an active outbreak when the baby's due, the doctor performs a cesarean delivery, and the dangers are almost completely eliminated. You're going to have plenty of healthy kids someday, Katie. -You make it sound like it's no big deal. -All the most dangerous things about herpes can be avoided. -Why do I feel like my life is over? -Well, probably for the same reason that a lot of people have an odd reaction whenever you mention the word herpes. They laugh nervously. They turn away in revulsion. And you know why? Because you get it by having sex. You might feel frightened, guilty, even embarrassed. Katie, I can treat the disease. I don't know that I can help you with those other feelings, but I'd like to try. But I can tell you this. They're far more dangerous than the virus. -Can I go? Will you come back so we can talk? -I don't know. -Is that you, honey? -Yeah. -I'll be right out. -Honey, what'd you do here? -You like it? -What's the matter with the dishes that were here? -They were ugly. We're only going to be here for the summer. Couldn't it have waited? -I wanted everything to be just perfect. Besides, we'll take them with us wherever we go, and we'll always remember where we first used them. Mr. Nicholas Todd, you are getting to be an old fuddy-duddy. Now, unless you think this lady is too big and fat and pregnant to make love to, why don't you give me a big sloppy kiss. -Dr. Holliston needed someone to fill in for him while he was on vacation. I got the job. -Well, I suppose it's quite a change from the big man at a hospital like St. Matthews. -Hallelujah. -Sure. But I suppose they've got a lot of the same problems here as they have any place else, right? Medicine is medicine. Somebody gets sick, they need a doctor. -Well, sure, everyday kind of medicine. What about the big health issues? Things that are, you know, of epidemic proportions? -I'm not sure I know what you're driving at. -I'm a reporter, Doctor. Couldn't help but notice. -Just reading up. Keeping current. -Oh, so you're saying we don't have that problem here on Paradise Isle. -Herpes is a national epidemic. Viruses don't respect boundaries, and the people of Paradise Isle are as susceptible as anybody else. -Maybe even more so, wouldn't you say, especially given their lifestyle here? -Look, this was supposed to be a get to know your visiting doctor interview. I think we should keep it that way. -Why? I thought the enlightened, intelligent point of view was to educate the public about herpes. I mean, they've got clinics that have sprung up all over the place. Newsletter, even dating services. Maybe you don't agree with all that. -As a matter of fact I do. -Hi, ya, Nurse. -Hi, Tommy. Kyle will be with you in a minute. -You work Saturdays, huh? -Till noon. Then it's off to the beach and curl up with a good book. -You know, you curl up with me instead, I could manage to cancel my tennis game with the Doc. -I [INAUDIBLE]. -Should I? -Tommy, your idea of a date is the shortest distance between a dinner table and a bed. I don't think so. -You know, you rush the net the way you rush the ladies, then I don't stand a chance. -He doesn't stand a chance anyway. -I heard that. -I know. -Oh. -Sit down, I'll buy you a drink. -Good idea. -Hello. -What are you doing here, Tommy? The last I heard, you were out on the circuit playing the tour. -Who needs it? What? Living out of a suitcase. Hustling endorsements? You know, hoping that McEnroe's got a cold in the first round when you play him. No, this is a sweet deal. You know, I spend a couple hours a day teaching the backhand to middle-aged ladies. And the rest of the time, it's beach and boogie. I mean, hey. -Yeah. -Know where I live? -No. -On an 80 foot yacht, because some skillionaire that I give lessons to wants a boat babysitter. I mean, anyone who can't be happy being a tennis pro on an island full of beautiful women is either stupid or dead. -Well, you're neither one of those. -What about you? Why aren't you on the cover of "Newsweek" or something? -Who needs it? -Speaking of beautiful women, Dr. Kyle Richards, Marsha [INAUDIBLE]. Marsha's been working here a month. She can't keep her hands off me. -Hello. -Hello. -I've warned her. Told her I'm dangerous. Aah, but you know how they can get. All right, Marsha, you win. Whenever you say. -It's nice to meet you. -Thank you. -Well, I got to pay my dues. Marsha, you can put his order on my tab, and you know you gotta quit hanging all over me. -Dr. Richardson? -Yes. -You're subbing for Dr. Holliston. -That's right. -My son has an earache. I was going to bring him in. -Well, I'll be happy to take a look at him. -Thank you. -You know, you and I almost met once before. It was the first day that I came here. You were on the ferry. -I'm sorry. I don't remember. And you almost ran me over. -Oh, that was you? -That was me. -Oh, I'm so sorry. Does that mean you're going to charge me more? -[PHONE RINGING] -Hello. Oh, hi, Frank. Listen, can he call you back. We're barbecuing. -Hello, Frank, did we close? Well, what happened this time? Oh, yeah, they'll be back. I'll talk to you later. -Dave, what is it? -Nothing. -Well, it's something. We can see you're upset. -Two more deals just fell through. What do you want to do, celebrate? Dave, don't shut us out. We're a family. If you've got a problem, we've all got a problem. Let's talk about it. Maybe we can help. -What are you going to do? Buy a condominium? Maybe turn the economy around? There are some things a family conference won't help. -I'll get the drinks. -I'm sorry, Princess. The old Skipper broke one his old cardinal rules. Never bring any trouble home from the office. I'll make it up to her with your mom. Hey, come on, no big deal. [INAUDIBLE] You OK? -Yeah. I'm fine. -Ah, you're more than fine. You're perfect. -How does it feel to be taking a beached whale for a walk on the sand? -Come on, honey, you look great. -I was so excited about coming to this island, how it would be so romantic. I guess I overestimated your desire for romance with me in this condition. -Honey, will you cut it out? I love you. -I know. I guess I'm just feeling a little bit insecure. I can't stand the thought of you being unhappy with me, Nick. -I'm not unhappy with you. -Well, something's wrong. I know it is. [INAUDIBLE] -I don't know. Um, this island, the new job, everything's happening so fast. -Nick, my dad got you this job, because it's a chance for us to go someplace. -Your dad got me this job, because he wasn't satisfied with his daughter being married to a guy who works in a print shop. And he got us this house for the summer so we could be together. -Well, he was just trying to help. -Well, I don't want his help. If you don't like me the way I am, then why did you marry me? -I married you because I love you. Only you won't let me show you anymore, because I can't get you to touch me. And that's not because of your job, or my father, or this island, or anything else. Nick, why won't you make love to me? -That's a boy. Uh-huh. OK. What we're got here is a genuine ear infection. So I think what you probably need, Jim, is a genuine lollipop. Yeah? -Yeah. -Yeah, all right. Go ask Lauren, OK? --[INAUDIBLE] antibiotics at $25.00 a bottle? -I have a sample. -Oh, no, that's OK. We're not starving. -No problem. Have him take all of them. The directions are on the bottle. -Thank you. -Marsha, I'd like you to have dinner with me sometime. -How do you know I'm not married? -I asked Tommy. -Look, whatever he said about me, whatever it is, it's not true. -He told me you weren't married. I asked because I was interested. Marsha, I'm new on this island. I don't know anybody. I hate eating alone, which is what I've done every night this week. Have I offended you? -No. -Then? -OK. -Nick, would you like it better if we stayed in the apartment on the mainland commuting out here everyday to work? -No. -Well, maybe you would have been happier if I'd stayed there. -Honey, I said I love you. -Show me. I want you to make love to me. [KNOCKING] -Dr. Richardson, I need to talk to you. I'm David Fairmont. -Is this a medical problem? -No, it's not. You gave this interview. -That's right. -This is a resort island, Doctor. Perhaps you saw the sign on the landing. Leave your troubles on the mainland. -Well, evidently a lot of people didn't. -Just what the hell did you think you were doing? You turned a simple interview into a scare story on VD. All of a sudden we've got an epidemic here. -I didn't say that. We're paying enormous amounts of money to promote the image of Paradise Isle, and you're trying-- -This has nothing to do with selling condominiums. This is a very serious health problem. -But we don't have to publicize it, do we? -Yes, we do. This is a place where people come to let loose, to relax, casual sex, casual relationships. It's a damn breeding ground. -And a damn lie. You have no right to drag the people-- -If you're telling me to keep quiet, you're wasting your time. I have a responsibility as a doctor. -And you have a reputation as a big mouth. -Lisa, I just don't want to go out. -Katie, what's with you? It's not like you broke up with Billy-- -Hildebrandt. And what if it is? -Because it's stupid, that's why. I mean, you've been on some other planet for like two weeks now. I'm trying to do you a favor, you know? -Thanks a lot. -Katie, don't forget to be back by 5:00 to help me with dinner. -Tonight? -Of course, tonight. Your father's having guests. I want the whole family here. -Oh, Mom. A bunch of us were planning to go to the Jug and Anchor tonight. -No, you're not. -Daddy, it's just a disco. -I know what it is, and you're not going. -Come on, Lisa, let's get out of here. -Dave, she's growing up. -I know. I know. -We dated all through high school and got married three days after graduation. Uh, while my girlfriends were single, meeting new people, starting new careers, I was starting a family. Lyle was a foreman on some of the construction around here. I thought we had a pretty nice life. -What happened? -Oh, he ran off with one of the summer people. So now I'm the one who's single, meeting new people, trying to start a new career. -Well, it seems to me you're handling it all remarkably well. -Oh, thank you. Oh, what about you, Doctor? How did you come here? Summer at sand and sun. -No. I needed the job. It was the best offer I had. Also, the only offer. -Oh, come on, a doctor with no job offers? -Actually, uh, I'm [INAUDIBLE]. -Why? -I got a bunch of doctors angry with me. -Oh. -I testified against a fellow physician. [INAUDIBLE] So I'm sort of laying low until it all dies down. -And then you'll go back to the big city? -Probably. -Where you'll continue your interrupted but inexorable quest for the Nobel Prize, right? -You [INAUDIBLE] heart. -Did you get into a lot of trouble? -Lot. -I didn't mean to pry. -No, no, please. I'm glad you did. I'm glad you know. -Kyle-- -I want you to know about me. I want you to know about me. And I want to know about you. -Yes, well, oh, my goodness. It's getting late. I have to get home. I promised the sitter. -Uh-- -Oh. -I'd like to see you again. -I really have to go. -I'd like to see you, too. -Hey, are you OK? -I don't know, a touch of the flu, I guess. -Well, it's just that we haven't talked for a while, and I thought maybe we could, uh, you know, get together again. -Sure. Yeah, I'll give you a call, OK? -The, uh, symptoms were all gone. I just want to know if I was contagious or not. KYLE (ON PHONE): It's not that simple. Chances are that you were OK, but you can't be absolutely sure. -Uh, but the symptoms were all gone. -Look, why don't you just come in, and I'll examine you. -Well, if you can't be sure, what difference would it make? -Why won't you tell me who you are? If you're afraid that you've infected someone-- -I didn't say that. -All right. All right, I'm sure everything is fine. There is nothing to be ashamed of. If you'll just come in and let me see you-- -Scotch, double. Come on. -Wait a minute. What's the matter with you? -You gave me herpes. -How do you know it was me? -You're the only one. -I'm sorry. Look, I've got [INAUDIBLE] here. -Hold it. -Wait a minute. -Do you realize what you've done to me? My wife can't understand why I'm afraid to touch her. What am I supposed to say? That I slept with some other woman? She can't handle that. -I don't remember you being so worried that night about what to tell her. -Shut up. You just had to have your last fling. -I said, shut up. -Lisa, would you help Mrs. Smith when you're through? -OK. Katie, oh, what are you doing? Come here, stand up. You've got to take a look at that. You've got to look at this top on you. It's great. Look at this, look. Is this or is it not the hottest thing you've ever seen? It's going to look so cute on you. -Lisa, I really don't feel like trying clothes on. -Oh, just this one, please. Look, you've got to try this one on. They don't have it in my size. I've got to see what it looks like. -Lisa. -Here, just try it. Be a friend, Katie. It's no big deal. I've got to order it for myself. -All right, all right. -So I've got to see what it looks like on somebody. I'm going to fix you up. Wait until you see Alan. You're going to thank me. He's the most gorgeous hunk I've ever seen. I'm talking for days he is so gorgeous. -I don't want to-- I don't want to go out with him. -Katie. -I don't want to try these things on. -Sorry. I swear. When did I suddenly turn into your worst enemy? -It's not you, Lisa. It's got nothing to do with you. -Yeah, I'll tell you when. Ever since you went out with Billie Hildebrandt, do you decided not to tell me anything about it, that's when. Oh, that top is totally divine. Here, you've got to try these one. -No. -Just put them in your hand and try them on. They go with the shirt. You know, Katie, you can make this all up to me in one fell swoop. -Please. -You can tell me absolutely everything that went on. -Lisa, shut up. OK. You want to know? I'll tell you. I went out with him. I went to bed with him, and he gave me herpes. Is that enough? -Uh, Katie, I, uh, come to think of it, I could get in trouble for this. You'd better take that off. -These photos are good. Did you take them? -Yeah, one of the 12 careers I've started. Uh, listen, I have a weird and unprecedented request from the peanut gallery. They want you to kiss them goodnight. -I'd like that. -Good. -Goodnight, [INAUDIBLE]. -Are you going to come back again? -Sure. Go to sleep. Come on. We had been engaged about eight months when everything hit the fan. So she thought she was going to marry the next Michael Debakey. In fact, she's engaged to him now. -You got walked out on, too. Welcome to the club. -Just a couple of victims, hmm? -Oh, thank you for being so nice to Bobby. -That's not called for. -Oh, yes, it is. I think he's been needing a bristly face to kiss. -How about you? -Kyle, don't. -Marsha, what's the matter? -It's not you. -Well, there's nobody else here. Look, I like you more than a little. I admit it. I want to hold you. I'd like to kiss you goodnight. Shake hands? Anything. -Kyle, please stop it. -No, I won't stop it until you give me some kind of explanation. -Well, I don't owe you any explanation. This is who I am. And nobody asked you to come around. -Marsha, what are you talking about? This island is crawling with sex if that's what I was interested in. -I think you better go. -What? Marsha-- -Kyle, please. Just get out. -I was over at the mainland this afternoon. -Uh-hmm. -And I saw this beautiful antique crib. And I was just thinking, wouldn't it be-- -Antique crib. Great, the baby will be very impressed. -Feel him move? -Yeah. -You feel him? -Yeah. -This kid is either going to be a dancer or kick field goals. I've never felt like this before, Nick. Never in my whole life. -I know. -Buy me an ice cream bar. -Another one? -I'm pregnant. I decide. -Uh, give me an ice cream bar. There. -Thank you. OPERATOR: The number you have reached is no longer in service at this time. And there is no new number. Please check the number and dial again. OPERATOR: What city please? -Yes, right here on Paradise Isle. For Ned Tolbert. 288 Bayshore Way. I'm sorry. I have no listing for that. -You sure there's no listing? OPERATOR: No, I'm sorry, sir. -Well, try the new ones. Maybe he's just here for the summer. OPERATOR: No, I'm sorry, sir, but we have no such address. -No such address? -Thank you. OPERATOR: You're welcome. -What's going on here, Kyle? I'm out in the middle of nowhere, and I get a message from Dave Fairmont about some newspaper article. I thought we understood each other. -Steve, do you remember a young guy that came here the day I arrived? You treated him for herpes. -Lyle, did you hear what I said? -This is his file. I think he left a false name or false address. And I think he called back worried about being contagious. -You think. -I saw him again tonight on the Midway. He had a very pregnant girl with him. It was probably his wife. -You don't know that. You're not even sure it's the same man. You saw him once for less than a minute. -Steve, he gave you a false name. That means he doesn't want anybody to know what he hasn't told her. -Hold it. -No. You called him an isolated case. -Listen to me. -I found 12 others in the files, Steve, 12 in the last six months. -They warned me that you were a troublemaker, Kyle. Haven't you made enough enemies already? -I think we have to find him. -I'll check it out. I want you to forgot about it. -No way. -I want this crusade to end here and now. No more interviews, no more [INAUDIBLE]. -Or? -Give yourself a break, Kyle. [KNOCKING] -What are you doing, Princess? The old Skipper's ready to hoist sale. I need a second mate. -Daddy, I really don't feel like sailing to some dumb island. -Hey, look, I know I've been a little rough on you lately. Particularly the other day, and I'm sorry. What do you do [INAUDIBLE]? I mean, all alone. You're like a hermit. Talk to me, Princess. -Daddy, why don't you just go sailing. I'm good. I'll be just fine here. -Honey, I know we kind of got out of the habit of talking. I've been so busy lately with the condo project and everything. -I know you have to work you don't have to apologize. -Well, I wasn't apologizing. I was feeling sorry for myself. The last couple of years, you've grown up quite a bit, and I haven't been around to see it. couple more years, you're going to be gone. -I'm not going to be gone. I'm never going to leave this house. -Sure you will. You'll find some nice young guy, and you'll wave goodbye just like that. Look, come on, why don't we go boating? I'll let you take the tiller like you used to. -Daddy. You remember when I went out with Billy Hildebrandt? -Yeah, what about it? -I knew you didn't like him very much. -Well, it wasn't that I disliked him. -Yes, it was. You don't like anybody I go out with. That's what I don't understand. Well, honey, it's because I love you that-- I don't want to talk about it right now. -Why can't we talk about it now? -All right, I understand. You wanted to go out with him, because he's a football star, an older guy, and you had a teenage crush. -It wasn't a teenage crush. -Katie, I tell you, I don't-- -Daddy, I went to bed with him. I'm sorry. I just-- I feel like you have a right to know. I just-- I want to sit down. I want to talk about it now. -Not now. -When? Daddy, when? When is it a good time? -Are you pregnant? Hmm? -No. But I love him. -Yeah, we got to get going. Are you coming with us or not? -Daddy, wait. There's something else I've got to tell you. -That's enough. -Daddy. -Get out there in five minutes or I'm leaving without you. -Daddy, wait. Daddy. I hate it, too. -OK, then just give me a shot or something, Kyle. -What the hell is wrong with you? This isn't syphilis or gonorrhea. You can't cure it with antibiotics. How much do you know about herpes? -Not much. I hear people talk. -OK, pal. Lecture time. Tommy, there are two types of herpes virus. Type one is common, like a cold sore or fever blister. Type two is what you've got. Genital herpes. I can't cure it, Tom. I can only treat the symptoms and give you the facts. -Well, I don't like the facts. -The facts don't care. You've got herpes. That means you have to tell the women you're going to go to bed with before you have sex with them that if you're having an active outbreak, they'll probably get it. -Great. How am I supposed to know when I'm contagious? -OK, the active period is called viral shedding. Your contagious from just before that during a period called the prodome, when you have a tingling or burning sensation. Then in a couple of days, the area becomes inflamed, blisters form, rupture, dry out. It usually takes about 48 hours. And then you wait until the lesions are completely healed. -What about the pain? -Tommy, your best medicine is your own body. With each active outbreak, your immune system creates antibodies to fight the virus, which means in all probability that each successive outbreak would be less severe. -Each successive outbreak? -Nobody knows what causes them. Stress, lowered body resistance. You may never have another outbreak, or you could have it again and again. -Why me? -Why anybody, pal? It's a bug. It doesn't care who it infects. -Oh, yeah. My sweet deal. Ladies, [INAUDIBLE]. You take away my boogie time, and I'm nothing but a tennis shoe salesman with a tan. -Nobody said you had to stop. You've just got to tell. -Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah, Tommy. Yeah, I've always wanted to make love to someone with the plague. It's your bet, Kyle. -Katie. Katie, you in there? Katie. Hey. What happened? -I don't remember inviting you in. -I don't blame you or anything. I mean, I'm the worst. I know it, you know. You think you could, uh, like forgive me? -For what? -God, Katie. I'm your best friend. I mean, you needed help, and I don't know, I freaked out on you. -Yeah. Well, you're not the only one. -You told your folks? -No. I tried talking to my dad. I did. But he wouldn't listen. So I trashed the room. I tried writing these letters to Billy. I can't send them. I feel so dirty and disgusting. What am I going to do? -I don't know. Oh, you poor kid. You must be going through hell. -You really hurt me. -I know. I know. [INAUDIBLE] myself. -Thank you. -May I come in? -Sure. -Kyle, I've got a lot to say and not enough nerve to say any of it. So if you could just bear with me, please. -OK. -I know I said that I don't owe you any explanations and maybe I don't. But I've been so miserable the last few days. So here goes. After my husband, Al, left me, I got used to playing the singles game. And I was pretty good at it. You know, one night stands. You know, nothing earth shattering but, uh, pleasant. Before I met you, I was dating a lawyer. We'd gone out several times. And the last night we were together-- Well, then, what is it? -I should have told you a long time ago when we first went out. I didn't know [INAUDIBLE], and when I realized I cared for you, I was afraid. -Afraid of what? -Marsha, I have herpes. Oh, god. I'm not active right now. It's not contagious. I wouldn't do that to you. And that's why the other night when you touched me, I freaked out. -If you're afraid he may have given you the disease-- -No, it's not just that. Don't you understand? I'm afraid-- I'm afraid that it's going to affect every relationship that I have, or that I will ever have. And I'm afraid of rejection. -Marsha. Herpes is a virus. A bug. I've seen what it does, because I happen to be a doctor. I've seen it destroy the way people feel about themselves, about others. Only now-- only now, it's threatening to destroy the way you feel about us. Marsha, I don't want that to happen. -Kyle, I'm sorry. It just can't work. And he thinks you're nice. I heard him tell Neil. He thinks you're cute. You're on your own, kid. Hi. -Here you go. [INAUDIBLE]. -OK, thanks. -Do you want to take a walk? -Yeah. -OK. -OK. -My father used to take my brother Jack and me fishing every summer. But this year we decided to come here instead. You know, the whole family. It's been great. I mean, this place is really neat. -Sounds like you guys are real close. -Yeah, we are. They're good people. I mean, don't get me wrong, we've had out troubles and all, but, you know, things [INAUDIBLE]. Listen, uh, we could go back to the party if you want. Do some dancing and stuff. -Oh, no. If that's OK with you, I'd just like to sit here. -Yeah, me, too. -OK. --[INAUDIBLE] kind of gives me a pain anyway, you know? We kind of think alike, you and me. [INAUDIBLE] I usually don't expect that on a blind date. I've enjoyed tonight, Katie. I'm glad we went out. And I'd like to do it again sometime. I mean, I think, uh, I think you and I could be real nice together. Oh, sorry. I guess I said something wrong. -Oh, no, you didn't. Um, well, I might as well tell you now, because sooner or later you're going to find out, and you're not going to want to have anything to do with me then. -Tell me what? -I have herpes. It seems like all I do is tell people that. -You feel like your whole life is ending. You feel like you'll never be clean again. And boy, the first time you have to tell someone, it's like dying. And sometimes they run. And sometimes they just sort of vague out. Sometimes, more and more, they understand. [PHONE RINGING] -Bay Club. Yeah, he's here. Nick, for you. -Hello. What? Honey, are you sure? The baby's not due yet. OK, well, where are you? On the mainland. Uh, OK, uh, go on over to the hospital. I'll catch the next boat over, and I'll meet you there. Yeah. -Big day, huh? -Uh, yeah, she just went into labor. I got to go. -Hey, good luck. -Oh, hey, wait a minute. Sorry, buddy, I'm in a hurry. I have to talk to you. It's very important. -Not now, man. -Uh, the young fellow that just walked out of here. What is his name? -Who? -Nick? Nick Todd. -How do I get in touch with him. -He works in, uh, public relations. But he's not there. Try the ferry. His wife's on the mainland. She just went into labor. -His name is Todd. Nick Todd. That's right. Well, just try anything, hospitals, clinics, anything, man. Good and get back to me as soon as you find him. Thanks. -Well, wouldn't he have told her? Or wouldn't she have noticed the symptoms? -Probably. But the symptoms could be masked. Lesions occur on the cervix. There are no nerve endings, no pain. She could be having an active outbreak and not even know it. -Bear down, bear down. Push. Push harder. Harder, push, push. It'll be over soon. Over in a minute. [PHONE RINGING] -Maternity. Yes, Doctor. Yes, Doctor. [PHONE RINGING] -Yeah. Where? OK, call the OR, tell them what to look for. Mike, thanks, I owe you one. I'm going over there. -I want to go with you. -Come on. [KNOCKING] -Your wife went into premature labor. And we found lesions indicative of herpes virus on the cervix. That may or may not have contributed to the premature delivery. We can't be certain. Is she aware that she's contracted the disease? -Uh, no. -She probably had a [INAUDIBLE] primary infection. She doesn't feel the symptoms. It happens in a small percentage of cases. People have the disease and they don't realize it. If we had only known in time, we could have performed a cesarean section, and there would have been very little danger to the baby. -Oh, my god. -But the labor was too far along. It was too late for cesarean We had to deliver through the infected birth canal. She was shedding herpes virus. The baby became infected. I'm sorry. We're treating the infection as best we can. But it's generalized and variable. The baby's on life support system. -No. Oh, god. No. -Maternity Ward. -Connie, you OK? Can I get you anything? -You knew about it. You have it, and you knew about it the last time we made love. -I wanted to tell you. Uh, but I was afraid. -Why, Nick? -I didn't know that this could happen. I didn't know anything about herpes. What was I supposed to tell you? That-- that I cheated? That I'd gone out with another woman while you were carrying our baby. Would you have understood that? -And instead, our baby is dead. You're right. I can't understand why you needed to go to somebody else. I don't understand it at all. The doctor said that I can go home in a couple of days. I don't want you to be there when I get back. -Honey. -I mean it, Nick. I don't want you there. -Kyle, I want to talk to you. -What for, more threats? -Joe Abbott called from the paper. You said something about you advertising a clinic for people with herpes. -That's right. I put an ad in his paper. -I'll do what I said, Kyle. I'll fire you and tell everybody why. -Good. Good, Steve, tell them the reason, too. Here. His real name is Nick Todd. He was spending the summer on the island. He worked for an advertising and PR firm. Guess whose development their promoting? -I don't know what you're talking about. -Connie, his wife, it was his wife by the way, gave birth to a baby girl. She was shedding virus, and she went into a premature labor. The baby's dead. -My god. She had contracted the herpes from Nick, because he didn't know any better, like everybody else. He was too ignorant to tell her anything. -Hey, Katie, Katie, come on. One set of tennis. I'm going to cream you. -Lisa, I really don't want to play tennis right now. -Oh, come on, come on, let's go. -I can't. I don't have any clothes with me. -So you borrow something of your mom's. She's got a whole locker full of stuff up there. Come on. Let's go. -All right. -All right. Be happy about it why don't you? Come on. -Mom. Mom, I'm home. Mom. -Up here. -I borrowed one of your outfits. I hope it's-- What are you doing? -Why didn't you tell me? -That was a letter to Billy. You had no right. -[INAUDIBLE]. Did you go see the doctor? -Yes. -Hey, uh, I don't understand. I thought we knew each other. -Mom, you don't know me. You haven't known me for years. -Obviously not. -Mom, I've been changing. I've been feeling all these things that I don't understand. I just needed someone to talk to. -Why didn't you come to me? -Why didn't you come to me? The only reason we're talking now is because you found my letters. -Who else have you told about this? -Just Lisa. -Oh, my god. -Mom, she's not going to say anything. -All right. It stops here. From now on we deal with this as family. -No, we won't. I tried talking to daddy. I tried to tell him. He doesn't listen. He can't even deal with it. -Right. From now on, it'll be just you and me. -Mommy, do you think I'm disgusting? -Hey, [INAUDIBLE]. What are you doing? -I'm getting rid of this stuff. -If I called the local paper and told them I saw Tommy Consodon sitting alone, they'd probably send over a photographer. -Very funny. -Mind if I sit down? Thanks. -Lauren, look, I know what you're trying to do. I would really rather be alone right now if you don't mind, please. But thanks anyway. -What do you think this is? TLC? -OK. You're a nurse. You work for Kyle. You've seen my records. You know I have herpes. -You are a fool, Tommy. I've always been interested in you. You've only been interested in one thing. That's why I wouldn't go out with you. I have nothing against making love to someone once I care about them. If I get to know them well enough to care. -You already took the ad. I paid you. We were set. I don't want my money back. I want the ad to run in the newspaper. I can't have a clinic if people don't know about it. -Hi. I used the copier at the club office. Nobody knew. I don't think it will do any good. The newspaper refused the ad, so did the radio station. -Well, these will be enough. We'll pass these out tomorrow. The club's having a huge promotion. Practically the whole island will be there. -I don't think you should be involved in this. I think you should stay out of it. You work there. There's no point in both of us losing our jobs. -Kyle, look at me. I was with you when that couple's baby died. My life's been a nightmare because of this disease. I'm one of the people who needs to know. Besides, I think I'm falling in love with you. -Joanna. -How do you do? -My wife, Joanna. They're very interested in some of the [INAUDIBLE]. -Great, John, will you excuse me just a minute. [INAUDIBLE]. Katie, honey, come on in, please. -Why, Mom? Aren't you doing enough of that for both of us? Your father is [INAUDIBLE], and we are here as a family to support him. And you are part of this family. Katie. -Be right back. You said you were going to do something about it. He's plastering the island with these. A herpes clinic. Why not a leper colony? -Can't stop him, Dave. -You said you'd get rid of him. -I mean, I won't stop him. He's right. People need to more about this disease. -Are you out of your mind? We're trying to save this project, and he's telling everybody the island is crawling with VD. -That's not my concern. I'm a doctor. That comes first. -That's great. That's very noble of you, Steve, but let me tell you something. If the Paradise Bay Project goes under, you can still practice medicine. -Me? I'm belly up gasping for air. So -Hi. -Hi. Wish you were out there with them? -A little. You don't forget how it feels to think you're the next Connors or McEnroe. -Is that what they are? -They think they are. 22 years old, making big money, everyone telling them they're the greatest thing in the world, especially women. Doesn't always work out that way, though. One day you wake up and your giving tennis lessons and selling warm-up suits instead of collecting prize money. You may realize there's a difference, but you hang in there anyway. Don't ask me why. You just do. Would you be willing to have dinner with me? Someplace where we could just have a nice meal, just sit and stare out at the ocean, and just talk. -I'd love that. -Dave, what can you do about it right now? -I don't know, but I'm going to do something. I'm sure as hell not going to sit here watching a tennis match. Now, of all times, he picks this weekend. -Dave. -Probably nothing more than a couple of sluts from the mainland. Makes out like it's all of us. Some kind of plague. -Katie, honey, I'm sorry. Please don't leave. -Why? Because I'm a part of the family? No thanks. -Please. -OK, Mom, you want me to stay? Hold me. Don't worry, Mom. You can't get it from holding hands. -What's going on? -If I can't stop you, and convince you to call this off, at least I can make it damn unpleasant for the people who come here. -I don't believe-- -These kind of people don't belong here. -You have no right. -No, you're wrong, Doctor. I have every right. It's you and the others who don't belong here. I live here. I helped build this-- Katie. Katie, what are you doing here? Go on back home. -I'm going inside. -Katie, I want you out of here. -Daddy, I'm going inside. That's why I'm here. -Turn off those lights, now. -Leave them on. I don't mind. -Katie, you don't know what you're saying. -Why don't you want the lights on me, Daddy? You're going to leave them on everybody else, aren't you? -I don't understand. -I have herpes, Daddy. -I'm sorry you had to find out this way. By coming here tonight, you've taken the first step in understanding and dealing with your disease. The worst thing about herpes is the less you understand, the less you know about it, the more likely it is to make you miserable. Herpes is surrounded by misinformation. Families can be torn apart, relationships destroyed, all because of a virus, a bug. There are drugs that can shorten the active outbreaks of the disease. And there are hopeful avenues of research that could lead someday to a preventative vaccine and eventually to a cure. But all that happens in laboratories and research centers. Here in this building, we're going to learn how to deal with the emotional side effects of having herpes. How to release repressive feelings of guilt and anger. How to prevent the disease from destroying normal sexual relationships. And if we succeed in helping each other by sharing information and feelings, I hope you'll encourage others to join self-help groups like this. The single most important thing that you can get from this group is to learn that whether you have herpes or the person sitting next you has it, you live normal, healthy, respectable lives. All right? Now that's enough of that. Let's start with some questions. Does anybody have a question?
