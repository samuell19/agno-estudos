But then, sooner or later the bodies get found. - Not if I'm doing it. - [Max] So you make sure that- - Yeah. - [Max] That they just disappear. - Yeah. (sniffs) You got no body, you got no cops. I mean, the cops have got no body, all they've got is a missing person. - [Max] Yeah, so there- - So their not gonna come round asking questions, and ya know, so, - [Max] No evidence. - Yeah, yeah. (crickets) - [Ray] Just put one over here. Uh, over here. Over here. There. Stand there. Fast, move. (rustling) Alright. (thunk, thunk) Over there mate, go over by the car. Start digging. (metal dragging) (deep breaths) - [Tony] It's eighty grand, cash. It's all fuckin' small bills. - What the hell you doing with eighty grand, cash? - [Tony] (deep breaths) Oh, let's just call it a bit of a nest egg. - A nest egg, and where is it, where's this money? - [Tony] Ugh, just out of Bathurst. - Yeah, where? - [Tony] On a, me old mans property, up there. - Where abouts on the property? - [Tony] It's marked, but it's not easily- You can't just walk around there and get it because um, anyone would dig it up. Come on man, I got a daughter. - Just fuckin' dig, I don't give a shit about your daughter. (thunk) (thunk) (thunk) - [Ray] Anybody got any chewey on them? Max? You got any chew? - [Max] Let me see. - [Ray] Eh? - [Max] Maybe. - [Tony] (pained exhale) - [Ray] Yeah? - [Max] Yep. - [Ray] Yeah? Not that sugar free, fuckin' poofter chew is it? - [Max] Nah. - [Ray] What is it? PK, Ugh, it'll have to do. Juicy Fruit's the preferred. What are you doing? (thunk) (thunk) (thunk) (thunk) (thunk) (thunk) What's this shit? What's that? What do you call that, you call that digging? - [Tony] No, I'm brea- - What's that? - [Tony] I'm breaking the shit off the edges. - Your breaking the shit off the edges? You break the shit off the edges we'll be here till fuckin' Christmas. Dig the hole. Put your foot on top of the spade, right, push into the ground. That's how you dig a fuckin' hole. - [Tony] But the dirt's too hard. - The dirt's too hard is it? - [Tony] It's pretty hard. - If I spit the chewy out- - [Tony] With eighty grand you could buy eighty million packs- - Eh, eh, I'm fuckin' talking here. Do ya mind. Just dig the fuckin' hole. If I spit the chewy out, and then have a cigarette, then there's only one chewy left. - [Max] Yeah. Is it alright if I have that chewy? - [Max] Yeah. - I just don't want to take your last chewy that's all. - [Max] Uh, you can have it. No worries. - I don't want to fuckin' have it now. - [Tony] Well you can buy- - What is that, every fuckin' times do I have to tell ya to stop jabbing the shovel in the fuckin' ground. Put your foot on the top of the shovel. Now, put your foot on- That's it, now push. That's what I want you to do. If I see you again, jabbin' the fuckin' shovel in the ground like that, I'm gonna shoot you in the fuckin' head and dig the fuckin' hole myself. - [Tony] Alright. - Alright? - [Tony] Mmhmm. - Fuckin' handle this. - [Tony] I mean, what does it take for me to fuckin' prove to you that I will fickin' disappear, I guarentee you, disappear. I'm not fuckin'. Fuck. - [Ray] (spits) - [Max] Ray, eighty grand is a lot of money after all. - [Tony] Eighty grand is a lot of money after all. - [Max] You might think of retiring yourself. - [Tony] Even if you don't fuckin' - I'll not fuck an eighty grand mate. - [Tony] Past it up against the wall, what ever. Fuck it's still a significant lump sum of money. And not many people can say, yeah I got eighty grand fuckin' cash sitting in my pocket, or whatever. And like I fuckin' say, I guarantee disappear. I'm fuckin' gone, I'm out of here, I'm fuckin' 'poof'. And you'll never, no one will ever hear me, see me, or smell me ever again. And in fact, what if we get there, at least fuckin', at least see that the money exists, and that has got to be some kind of token that I will fuckin' go. If I'm not bull-shitting about the fuckin' money, then I'm not bull-shitting about fuckin' disappearing. It's not like it's really any fuckin' major fuckin' trial or tribulation to fuckin'- You to fuckin' to stop this now. All you're doing is postponing the inevitable rather than fuckin'- - Put she shovel down. - [Tony] Bull shit. (thunk) - Stay in the fuckin' hole. Sit down. - [Tony] Come on man, you don't have to do this. - Just sit down. - [Tony] The money, it's there. - Sit the- Don't pick that fuckin' shovel up. Sit down.

(Burps) Not in there, in the boot. - [Tony] Not the boot again. - Don't start this shit, just get in the fuckin' boot. - [Tony] But I went the last eight hours in there. I'll fuckin' die. I'm claustrophobic for fucks sake. - Alright, would you prefer the hole or they boot. - [Max] But listen, what's the problem with him sitting in the back? - Have you smelled him? - [Max] Well he pissed himself. - [Tony] I'm claustrophobic. - Yeah, well your not sitting in the car fuckin' stink-afy my car up? - [Max] Look mate, it's not even your car.

I'm not giving him mine. - [Max] Okay. I'll do it. Hold the camera. Hold the camera. Yeah, by the legs, right good. - [Tony] Thanks man. - [Max] No worries. - [Tony] I appreciate this. (humming engin) (tropical music) - [Max] Tony, how long have you been dealing drugs? - Since I was about 15. So about eight years. - [Max] Are you 23 now? - Yeah. - [Max] And what sort of drugs are you dealing with? - These days, just ickies. But it all started with pot, when I was about 15. There was a market there. - [Max] A market there, where? - In school. - [Max] Ah, in school. - Yeah. Lot of kids smoking pot at school, ya know? So, I was happy to provide them with what they required. Yeah I'm living comfortably now, that's for sure. - [Max] How much do you make in a year? - About, I'd say I probably clear a hundred grad a year. - [Max] Geeze, it's not bad. - Nah, it's not good either. It's no biggie, ya know? It's not like I'm som big boss, drug dealing crime lord or anything. I'm small fry. - [Max] So is your daughter living with your wife? - Yeah. Ya know, I see her like once a month. And maybe a couple of night- Like a weekend a month, and then maybe a couple of nights through the week, here and there. Depending on how Michelle feels. - [Max] So, what does your wife do? How does she support herself and her daughter? - She's on the Dole at the moment. - [Max] So do you pass on money to them? - Oh fuckin' yeah. I might be a drug dealer, but I'm not a scum bag. Nah, I look after my daughter. I love her with every bit my heart. - [Ray] When your breaking into it. - [Max] Yeah. - Eh. - [Max] Yeah? - What they get? - [Max] Uh, everything. TV, stereo, uh, VCR, DVD player. - Did you tell the other cops? - [Max] Yes I did, but you know... And I actually, I actually even know who did the job. But, the cops can't do anything because there's no, you know? There's no evidence. - Who do you think did it? - [Max] Who do I think, I'm sure that it's this guy Edna is gotta- He's a junkie, that I used to live with in Carlton years ago. - Yeah. - [Max] I mean the guys been in jail, uh, you know for robbery, so, you know. - Yeah. - [Max] And uh, but apart from all that, after I spoke to the cops I, I went to wrong place, and you know? He denied it but, he denied it in a way that that, 'Yes, I fucked you mate'. Ya know? You can't do anything, so... (Ray laughs) - So that's who ya know? And where's he live, this guy? - [Max] Brunswick. - Well... - [Max] I'm so pissed off. - What about we go around there and uh, I'll have a chat to him. - [Max] So what you gonna do? - I'm just gonna have a word to him. See what he says. - [Max] What if he denies it? What if he- - I'll sort him out. - [Max] What do you mean sort him out? - Well ya know how I sort out things. - [Max] Yeah? - Well... - [Max] Look, listen, I don't really feel comfortable with this. Could you, could you just go and talk to him? - Well I can talk to him, but I mean you spoke to him, he's denied it to you. He's probably just pretty much gonna deny it to me, so I mean... You know I can talk to him, but I don't think that's gonna get me very far. - [Max] Yes, but, could you just do me this favor, just go and talk without using any violence, and see you know, and see what happens. - Okay. Alright, yeah, see what happens, but what happens if he denies it? What do I- - [Max] Well, we'll think about it later. Just go, and uh, without you know, without even thinking of hitting him. Just try to talk and convince him. Can you do that? Uh, I know, I mean it's a favor I'm asking you. I know what your methods are, but you know... Could you do that? (opens door) (squeaks) (ring, ring, ring) (opens door) (inaudible) - [Edna] Man, fuck off. (slams door) - [Max] What about the drug- your drug issue? What is your position? Do you think it should be legalized? What do you think? - Well I think if ya', probably three quarters of your- three quarters of your crime at the moment is probably drug related. So, if you get rid of drugs, you'd basically, three quarters of your crime your gonna wipe out over night, so... You know? From a public point of view, it's probably a good idea. I mean, they've had this war on drugs for the last what? 20 years or so? And I don't see that they've actually stopped anybody. I mean, everyone is still taking them. All people are taking them every day. I mean you can't- You can't stop people doing something they want to do. You know, if they want to go and uh- (traffic) (church bells) If I want to go and do drugs or, ya know, shoot up, nobody's gonna stop me. You know what I mean? Johnny here thinks he's gonna stop me from doing drugs, I mean he's fuckin', ya know, It ain't gonna happen. You want to just go through there? - [Max] Yeah, okay. - Just watch that pole will ya mate. - [Max] Yeah. - You know, it's oh, you know, legalize it. Um, and a lot less people are gonna die of uh- - [Max] But don't you think that free access to such a dangerous substances would have a very bad impact on the public's health. - Well the only people that are gonna- Like heroin freaks for example, the only person who's gonna take heroin's a fuckin' idiot on the first place. So, you know... All it's gonna do is thin out the dick heads. You know what I mean? I mean like, as far I'm concerned, if your stupid enough to take heroin, your a fuckin' idiot, and you deserve to fuckin' die anyways. So... (squeak) (dog barking) (hammering) (door opens) - [Max] (groans) - Happy? (slams door) - [Max] What did he say? - Well, what do you think he said? - [Max] Now look, let's go then. (laughs) Just- - Nah mate, I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna sort this fuckin' prick out. Alright. (smacking) - [Max] Look, listen, I don't feel comfortable with that. - Yeah, well that's a bit late for that now man. - [Max] Hold on. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Listen, listen, listen. Okay, I understand I'm not gonna stop you. - Well ya' can't. - [Max] Well, but could you please use the least, the least amount of violence necessary? Can you do that? (gum smacking) Can you try to use the least- - I'll try to use the least amount amount of violence necessary. - [Max] Okay? - Yes, yes. - [Max] Are you cool with that? - I'm cool with that. Yeah. - [Max] Thanks, I really appreciate that. - Okay, can I go now. - [Max] Yeah. - Okay. (opens door) (thunk) (slam) - [Max] Oh no...

(squeak) (gate crash closed) (opens door) (closes door) - Your CD player, your DVD player, - [Max] Yeah. - he's gotten rid of those. What do you reckon they would have cost ya'? If you bought them now? - [Max] Mmmh. About at least a grand? - A grand? Uh-hu. - Alright. You owe him two grand, alright? What day is it today? - [Max] Today, Wednesday. - Okay, you got till next Wednesday, that's a week. Right, to come up with two grand. You know where he lives, Right? If you don't come up with the two grand in a week I'll be coming back here. Alright? And you know what's gonna happen. Right, okay, now apologize. - Man I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's okay? - [Ray] Happy with that? - [Max] Yeah, it's alright. - Happy? Yeah? - [Max] Yeah. - Alright, piss off. A week. (opens door) Happy chappy? - [Max] So, that's your least amount of violence? But that seemed the maximum. You say you have children? - Yep. - [Max] How many? One? Boy or girl? - Girl. - [Max] How old is she? - She's seven. - [Max] Seven. - Yeah. - [Max] Mmmh. Do you see her? - I used to see her. I used to see her a fair bit but, my ex-wife she moved up to Queensland. She's remarried so... - [Max] Ah. - Yeah, it's kinda- - [Max] Makes it hard, yeah. - Yeah I mean, I'd like to see her, but... I feel like I'm kind of uh, like a hanger on to- You know, I'm out of the loop. You know what I mean? They got the little family going and I go up there and I feel like that guy, yeah, I feel like, You know...

I'm just making conversation. (traffic) Any kids? - If you could have any car, like in the world, what would it be? - Porsche. - Like new one, or one of the old classics? - Turbo, four wheel, lightest one at least. Lightest turbo. - Cool. (swish, swish) - What about you? - Oh mate, I've got this beautiful Commodore, and it's not in the best condition but I love it. - What sort? - VK. - Mmhmm. - Yeah, but um... If money was no option I would I wouldn't buy some shmee car Ferrari or anything, I just do her up. - What is it, what's the Commodore? - VK. - A VK, you'd rather have a VK Commodore than a Ferrari? - Yeah, yeah for sure. I'm not- I mean, I'm not a big rough head sort of car man, so... Or anything ya' know. Simple pleasures. - So if somebody gave you a choice, they gave you a $500,000 Ferrari and a VK Commodore, you'd take the VK Commodore? - Not any VK Commodore, I'd take my VK Commodore. - You'd take your VK Commodore over a Ferrari. - If I had the cost of the Ferrari in cash to be able to spend on, on the Commodore, that's a- - How are you gonna spend 500 grand on a fuckin' Commodore? - I wouldn't have to, but you know like- Probably cost me to have it completely shmeaking as new, kinda thing, probably 10, 20 grand or something. You know, get it all done, by the people in the know. Do a bit me-self but... (swish, swish) (crumpling paper) (smacking food) (loud crumping paper) - [Max] Have you been to the Mardi Gras? - The gay Mardi Gras? - [Max] Yeah well, is there any non gay Mardi Gras? - Yeah. - [Max] And have you been? - They gay Mardi Gras? - [Max] Yeah. - No. - [Max] Why not?

But why would I go? Am I lot's of people? What are you trying to say? You trying to say I'm a poof? - [Max] No. No. - Then why you asking me if I'm going to Mardi Gras for? Have you been to Mardi Gras? - [Max] Well I've never been to Sydney but- - Well why haven't you been to the Mardi Gras? There's a Mardi Gras down here in Melbourne. - [Max] Is there? - Yeah, St. Kilda has one. Have you been there? - [Max] No. - How come? - [Max] I didn't know. - You didn't know, why not? That's not good enough. - [Max] Well, it didn't come to it you know. And nobody told me. I don't know. But uh, you know, probably because I don't uh- (Ray chuckles) - If you'd have known would you have gone? - [Max] Probably would have. - Okay. - [Max] Yeah. I mean- - 'Cause your a poof. - [Max] No. (flick, flick, flick) - [Max] So your against- Have you got something against homosexuals? - Oh look, I don't think I've got anything against them. I mean it's not my cup of tea, but you know. What ever blows your whistle. - [Max] Is that right? - Yeah. - [Max] Because you know, your a very attractive man, you know. Your a very beautiful man. (Ray laughs) Fascinating man. (Ray laughing) Charming at times. - Yeah, keep going. - [Max] Yeah, I mean you, ya' know? I definitely think you should go. - Yeah? - [Max] Yeah? - Well maybe we'll go together. - [Max] Oh. (heavy, fast walking) - [Ray] Hey, hey. What's going on? - [Ben] Nothing. - What are you doing? - Going home. - What are you doing here? - I live here. - What are you doing in Melbourne? What did I say to you last time I spoke to you? - I went to Sydney for a couple of weeks, alright. Things didn't work out. - Let's go. Let's go. - Where? - We are gonna go for a little drive, - Ugh, fuc- - Let's go. (city bus breaks squeak) You pick a state. Alright? - Why are we going for a drive? - We're gonna go, I'm gonna drive ya' to where ever the fuck you want to go, alright. Where do you wanna go? - Dude, you know- If I come with you, just tell me that nothing bad is gonna happen. - Nothing bad is gonna happen as long as you do what I fuckin' tell to do. If I was gonna whack ya' mate, you'd be fuckin' dead already, right? I would have done ya in the fuckin' alley back there. Alright? You can pick the fuckin' state. Where do you want to go? (Ben mumbles) Well pick one, 'cause we got to fuckin' drive some. So, where do you want to go? - [Ben] To Queensland. (Ray, exhales) What ever is easier for you. - What ever is easier for me? How 'bout I fuckin' shoot you right here in the alley, that's easy for me. That good for you? - Okay, he's gay, he's kicking around Hollywood and that sort of shit. He doesn't want to be gay because he feels like it will damage his career. 'Cause at the time he was being young and gay, was, you know? Gayness was still pretty shhh'ed upon. His fuckin' all these blokes, left, right, an center. - [Ray] You like this, man? - [Max] Well, it sounds to me like a pile of bullshit. - It is, it's like a pile of bullshit too. - [Max] Yeah, we'll just keep listening. Till this makes a bit more sense. - [Ray] That's uh, what, how many people in Hollywood you think are gay then? Is everybody gay in Hollywood? - [Tony] Most, well uh, a fair proportion. - [Max] Well if he's gay, I want to be gay too. (Max, Ray laugh) Think being gay- - Made you get, yeah, the same women- (Max laughing) Women he gets. - [Max] I wish I could get the kind of women he gets. (both laugh) I want to be gay. - [Ray] I want to be gay too. - [Troy] Man look at the fuckin' puppets. You can be gay but there's not much porn because he's got these, relatively attractive women hanging off his shoulder, but it's all a fuckin' sham. - [Ray] So he's not having sex with them? - [Tony] No. There's ah- - That sounds a bit- - [Tony] Hang on, does he have his own kids? - [Max] I know, I know, listen, because even the women he marries... - [Ray] Yeah? - [Max] They're gay too. They're, I mean according to Tony's theory- - No, I didn't say everyone in Hollywood is gay, and I certainly didn't say all women are gay. But there's a lot of gay men. It's a pretty fuckin' gay profession if you think about it. Through fuckin' history there's been a lot of gay poofter fuckin' blokes actors. (pained exhale) (exerted breathing) - [Ray] My balls ain't hanging out are they? (exerted breathing) (fast breathing) (groaning) (whoosh) - [Max] Can you do one arm? - Fuck that now. I'm gonna jump in the shower, right. - [Max] Okay. - Keep an eye on him, alright? (jingling shower curtain) (whispering) - Max? - [Max] What? - Do you reckon- Do you reckon he's gonna let me go? (coughs) - [Max] No. I can't guarantee anything. I think he's gonna let you go. I mean, I'll have a word with him. But I'm pretty sure your gonna make it. Your gonna make it up with this. But of course, I can't guarantee. - So, what if- What if you let me go now, right now, while he's in there. - [Max] No, can't do that. - But he won't- He's not going to do anything to you. - [Max] No. - Your not a criminal. - [Max] No. That Ray guy in there, if I let you go he's not going to be a happy chappy. And that is the last thing I want to see. Ray not being a happy chappy. (shower curtain rattles) You know what I mean? - Mmhmm. - [Max] So, don't ask me again. - Sure. - [Ray] Having a chat are you guys? (belch) (toilet flush) - [Max] Are you doing fine down there? - [Tony] Mmhmm. - [Max] Okay. (yawn) - [Ray] So what the camera cost you? - [Max] Uh well, around about 5 thousand. (Ray laughs) - [Ray] What the fuck you doing? - [Max] Well I'm getting to bed. - [Ray] What you taking your pants off for? - [Max] Well I can't sleep with my pants on. - [Ray] Well you'll not fucking sleep next to me with your fuckin' cock hanging out, pal. - [Max] What do you mean? - [Ray] What do I mean? I mean your not sleeping next to me with your fuckin' bare ass. (laughs) - [Max] Well I'm not gonna fuck you up the ass if that's the wor- - [Ray] Yeah, well I don't want to take any fuckin' chances, alright. - Ugh, come on. - [Ray] No. - How long have we known each other? - [Ray] Not fuckin' enough for you to sleep next to me fuckin' naked. (exasperated exhale) - [Tony] I don't mean to interrupt here, but I don't think it would matter how long I might have know someone. A bloke I'd feel pretty weird about sleeping with if he was naked. - [Max] Look pal, I gave you my undies. So shut the fuck up. - [Tony] I appreciate that. I indebted to you for that. - [Max] So, - [Tony] You sleep however you want. - [Max] Good. - [Ray] No, you sleep with your fuckin' pants on. (laughs) Right? Or you could sleep on the couch. Alright? - [Max] On the couch. - [Ray] Yeah, if you want to sleep with no pants on- - [Max] Yeah, but, I mean there's no other blankets. - [Ray] That's not my problem. Just sleep with your fuckin' pants on. What's the big deal? I got my pants on. - But I'm not used to. Come on. - [Ray] Not used to what? - To sleep with my pants on. - [Ray] Well your just gonna have to get used to it. Right? (Max exhales) You big poofter. (faint speaker on radio) - [Max] So Ben, do you follow footy? - Yeah. - [Max] Who do you barrack for? - North Melbourne. - [Max] North Melbourne. Isn't it the team where that guy fucked his mate's wife? What's his name? What's his name? - Wayne Carey. - [Max] Wayne Carey, that's him. That's him. So he's the captain and he fucks vice captain's wife. You know, not very smart. He must be really nice guy. - Oh you know, fuckin' wasn't the smartest thing to do, but everyone makes mistakes Max. - [Max] Well- - [Ray] It's not a fuckin' mistake mate. Sticking your fuckin' dick in your best mates wife, that ain't a mistake. - [Tony] Yeah it is. Its a mistake- - How is that a mistake? - [Tony] 'Cause you know, it's like a life mistake. - [Ray] Fuckin' life mistake. - Like you make life mistakes? - [Max] But a mistake is more like, if you go to school or you misspell a word, that's a mistake. - [Ray] Yeah, that's a mistake. Somebody asks you to spell cat, and you spell it c.o.t. That's a mistake. But sticking you dick in your best mates wife it's not a mistake. Unless it was dark when he fucked her. - [Tony] So it was the wrong decision then. Which is I guess- - [Ray] 'Cause I mean Carey knew what he was doing was wrong, he knew that it wasn't his wife. He knew who's wife it was. He knew he was wrong. But he did it anyway. So that's not a mistake. Mistake is when you don't know it's wrong when your doing it. - [Tony] Well I reckon he deserves a second chance. - [Ray] He's already had a second chance. This is the second time he's pulled some shit like this. He's bloody went to court a couple of years ago for feeling up a chicks tits. - [Tony] What's wrong with that? - What's wrong with- What's wrong with what? Feeling up a chicks tits? - [Tony] Just feeling the titties. - [Ray] Look uh, if she's happy for you to do it then that's great. But she wasn't. - [Tony] How do you know she just wasn't lying like uh- - [Ray] Ah, look you have to go by what the court says. I mean the court says, you know, they heard all the evidence and they said, yep. You know. - [Tony] Don't believe everything read. - Oh look you, I mean- I mean I think your just biased. I mean your a North Melbourne supporter so of course everything Wayne Carey does- - [Tony] Nah. - I mean you think the sun shines out his ass. (lighter switching) (distant traffic) - The great outdoors. - That's it mate. - So I'm supposed to take a shit out there? - [Ray] Well you can do it in the road if you like? - No. What am I supposed to do to wipe my ass? (rustling) Thanks. - Pitiful. (birds chirping) (dripping water) I ain't showing you fuckin' cock. (Max laughs) - [Max] I wouldn't. (distant passing car) So Ray, how much would it take for you to eat a bowl of shit? (loud traffic) - [Ray] A bowl of shit? - [Max] Yeah. Let's say they presented you with the offer. You know, money for eating a bowl of shit. - How big is the bowl? - [Max] Just a cereal bowl. Normal bowl. - Who's shit? It's shit though , does it matter? - Well it matters mate. (truck passing) - [Max] What's the difference in- Shit is shit. - Shit ain't shit. Big difference between my shit and somebody else's shit. - [Max] Well, what's the difference? - Well it's my shit. I don't want to eat somebody else's fuckin' shit. - [Max] Okay, okay. Let's say it's your shit then. - Yeah. - [Max] How much would it take for you to eat it? (deep breath) - Hundred grand. - [Max] Hundred grand? - Mmhm. - [Max] That's for a bowl of your shit. How 'bout my shit? - Half a mil. - [Max] Half a mil. So about five times. Why, why? What's the- I mean, my shit is definitely is going to be better than yours, since I eat a lot better. (laughs) - Yeah, but it's your shit. - [Max] Yeah? - So it doesn't matter how good you eat. It's never gonna be better than my shit. - [Max] Well, well let's leave it like that. - So how much to eat my shit, for you? - [Max] Uh, I wouldn't. - You wouldn't eat my shit, for any money in the world? - [Max] Well I wouldn't eat your shit, I wouldn't eat my shit. I just really- You know, I'm not into shit. - Yeah, well I'm not big on shit either. Fucking hell. (both laugh) I mean I won't do it for free. (rustling) Where's your jacket? - Wipe my ass with it. Uh, fuck. - You know, let's go. (Tony mumbles) (Boom, boom) (bird calling) - [Max] Uh... Ah... (thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk) - [Max] I don't get it. - Did he suffer? - [Max] Oh, I don't think he did, but still- - Eh, there ya' go mate. That's why I did it. He didn't suffer. If somebody had to do it, somebody else who didn't give a shit about him, he would have fuckin' suffered. Right? Understand? (traffic) - [Max] I understand yes, but I don't understand how you can- I mean- (exhales) (thunk, thunk, thunk) Still, you killed him. I mean, you killed your friend. - He had to go, right? Somebody was gonna do it, right? If not me, somebody else, right? That somebody else, right, would have made him suffer. He would have known it was coming. He would have been pissing his pants, and crying his fuckin' eyes out. Right. And if that's the way he's gonna go, I didn't want him to fuckin' go like that. Now, at least this way he didn't fuckin' suffer. Alright. (thunk, thunk, thunk) Turn it off me. (slow piano music) - [Max] You gonna let him go? - See how we go. (low hum) - [Max] What does it depend on? I mean, I think he's been honest and I don't think he's gonna, you know, fuck around. I think the money's there and everything will go smooth. What do you think? - We'll yeah, I mean, if the money's there. I'll make up my mind then, I guess. (thunk) (thunk) (thunk) If he doesn't, you know? If he shows his face back there in Melbourne again, you know, that's not good for me. - [Max] I don't think he will. - Yeah, but that's the thing. I mean, there's no guarantee. (Hard exhale) I mean, if he ends up in jail. He goes to Queensland and ends up in jail... You know I don't- You know, I don't think it's such a good idea to let him go. (sniffs) (thud) (thud) (scraping) (thunk'ing) (shaking) (crow calling) (cough) (bang, bang, bang) (metal can opening) (thunk) (thunk) - [Tony] Alright. Before you say anything, I know it's not 80 cash. I didn't know what else to tell you, I thought, if i told you that it was cash you would be more inclined to take me up on the offer. But that is half a key of pure, uncut coke. And you'll easily get a hundred grand for it. - What am I supposed to do with it? Do I look like a fuckin' drug dealer? - [Tony] Well, er, but no. But you know drug dealers. Or I know drug dealers, I've got contacts. And if I- I mean I can talk to them and say look, I got this half a key, pure, 80 grand. (snap) They'll snaffle it up, because it's worth so much more than that. Well not heaps, heaps more. But it's cheap. And so their guaranteed to buy it. I guarantee you can- you can off load in 24 hours. And if I had said to you, 'I got a bag of coke up there.' I don't think you would have- (plastic package opening) Ray? Do you understand or forgive me? Do you understand where I'm coming from? 'Cause I mean, if you were in the same situation, your gonna say what yo- Uh- I'm not bullshitting. (crumpling plastic) That's like a powdered cash. 80 thousand dollars in powdered cash right there. (crumpling plastic) (metal thunk) (thunk) (thunk) (thunk) (scraping) Ray? (exhale) - Let's go. (howling wind) - [Max] Ugh, uh, shhh. (keys jingling) (thunk) (door opens) - Take off. (loud wind) - [Tony] Hold on. - Take off. - [Tony] What, fuckin' go? - Piss off. (keys jingling) Know what piss off means? - [Max] Come on, he told you to go, go. - [Tony] Thanks Ray. - [Ray] Just fuckin' go. - Thanks Max. - [Max] Go, go. (scraping boots) - [Tony] I won't forget this. - [Ray] Hope to fuck you don't. Go on, disappear. (wind in trees) (Ray laughs) - [Ray] Got the ugliest pair of fuckin' underpants I've ever seen in my life. - [Max] What do you mean? Their mine. (Max laughing) - [Max] That is if you are watching that means- - Right, yeah I get you. Like what Pauline Hanson did. Where she said you know, if your watching this, I'm dead. Sort of thing. - [Max] Kind of thing, yes. - Alright. Like I'm dead. When people see this, I'm dead already . - [Max] Yes. Yes. But they don't know. So you have to tell them. I mean, they might know. It depends how you die, you know? (Ray laughs) - Yeah alright. - [Max] If you not die some spectacular way, - Yeah. - [Max] and you get you know, to be famous. (coughs) Which would be good because then I would make a little bit of money out of this. If you actually became famous. Yeah, well- - Yeah, but your gonna be fucked. - [Max] Am I? - Well, this comes out, people see me killing people, and you were there, I mean, that makes you an accessory. - [Max] Well I'll figure a way not to, you know. I'll just get the money. - You'll just get the money. - [Max] I don't care about fame. - Head off to South America with it. - [Max] Yes. - Yeah, alright. So I'm just saying, I'm dead, that's it. - [Max] Yep. Like if you are, you know? If your watching this that means that uh, and uh, you know. - Yeah, I'm dead, bla, bla, bla. - [Max] And uh, you know, be kind of dead serious. - Serious? - [Max] But humorous. Okay. - Yep, you want me to look there? Or at you. - [Max] Yeah, nah- - There? - [Max] Camera, camera lens. (Back up, beep, beep, beep) But your no Marlon Brando. That's what you're trying to do now. (laughs) Nah, that's cool, that's cool. - Yeah? Alright. So you just tell me when to- - [Max] Any time. - Right now? Yeah? - [Max] Yeah. - Roll? Okay. Um... The rit- (crash) - [Max] It's okay, it's okay. - Just got to think about what I'm gonna say. Alright, okay. You rolling? - [Max] Yep. - Alright. So uh, the reason that um- I agreed- I mean, I decided I was gonna- (beep, beep, beep) Fuckin' man its tough. (clears throat) Uh, How's it going? When I agreed to make this documentary, I agreed on one condition. (loud Honk, honk, honk) The condition- The condition was- (crash) (honk,) that the public would only get to see this film if I was dead. After I was dead. So if your seeing this now, basically means that, you know. I'm no longer with us, sort of thing. So, um... Yeah, I hope you, you know... Enjoy the, enjoy the show. How was that? (haunting electronic ambient sound) (traffic) Max, what are you doing? - [Max] Uh, I'm gonna catch the tram, up here. - Yeah. - [Max] What about you? - I go on a train, alright. - [Max] Alright, well, well we- You know, I'll give you a call, you give me a call and- - Yeah, yeah.
