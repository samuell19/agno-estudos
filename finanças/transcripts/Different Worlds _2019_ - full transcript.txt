(upbeat music) [Darren] So man, are you excited? Yes, of course I'm excited to see what the girls offer. I am so excited, I can't wait. (phone rings) Sorry, excuse me. Yes, hello. Yes, I'm headed to airport already. No, don't worry. Don't worry, it's fine. I'm okay. Yes, okay, I'll talk to you when I return. Okay, bye. Bye-bye. (Darren laughs) As I was saying, I'm looking forward to like having a new and change of environment. And a new experience, for the first time. I mean like I'm just gonna experience something new. Experience America. Yes, I understand. So where are you going again? Okay, I'm going to New Orleans, New York, Miami and Chicago. Wow. Yes, let me go and experience all these places I've heard stories. For the first time, let me just witness it. Look, don't go out there in Miami having too much fun, if you know what I mean. Oh please. I'm just going there to like it. Just let me have fun, okay? Let me have fun. (Darren laughing) Miami I'm hearing stories, so let me at least go experience it. (car hooting) Yes. Yeah. (airplane engines roaring) (upbeat music) Hey man, what part of Africa are you from? Nigeria. [Driver] Okay, so what brings you down to good old New Orleans? Well, it's my birthday month. (driver chuckles) So I chose this place to celebrate it. [Driver] Okay, you know you picked the best place to celebrate, right? [Ike] I hope so. (jazz music) [Ike] My brother, if you don't mind, before we get to Eastover, I'd like to pick up some new clothes. Do some shopping or something like that. - [Driver] Okay. - And also, I'd like to see some new people, real people, New Orleans people. I'll pay you extra, if don't mind.

Well, yeah, that painting, I like it. That's actually one of my favorites. Oh, is it? Okay, so tell me about it. Well, this painting I call "Life". You know how life can be chaotic when you've got a million things going on. And sometimes we just forget the true meaning of life, to live. So this is chaos dispersing out happiness, and love, and peace. Life. Wow, truly beautiful. (chuckles) Thanks. I mean the painting. Your work is actually fantastic. I like it. Right. I'm definitely going to take this home Really? Yes. I mean I want to buy this now, today. (chuckles) Okay. Alright, let me go ahead and write you up then. By the way, my name is Ike. Eke? No, not eke. That means ass in my language. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's Ike, call me Ike. Ike is better. - Ike. - Yes. Well thanks, Ike. I appreciate it. Okay, your welcome. Oh yeah, for the painting. There you go. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's way too much. Wait, this painting is worth more than this. I appreciate that, but I can't. I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage of you. I'm giving you what you deserve, okay? You're that good. Okay, thanks, I appreciate it. You're welcome. Let me go ahead and package that up for you? Yes, please. Do you need help? Oh, no. (tranquil music) (upbeat music) ♪ Oh honey could buy something ♪ [Zaria] What's up bitch? - How you doing? - Good. Got your coffee already. Girl whatever you're canvasing, that's a first. Not really I'm only five seconds later than you, don't get too proud. So what's going on? It's been like a week since we all linked up, I'm sure someone has some tea to spill. What? I'm still single because the men clearly can't handle my strong personality. And my boss is a jackass, but I just got a nice raise, so no complaints. Oh, we know how you like to keep a certain level of drama in your life. Oh, Yoshua stopped by the boutique this week. I got some new things, and that I know y'all will love, and Liyah, I have some rather sexy items for you. Oh, then you know I'm gonna be in there today. Got to keep it hot with my single ass. Cool, I'll be in there too. Got some stunning money anyway. This guy came in and bought that "Life" painting with major interest. And when I say major, I'm talking about both kinds of interest. He said my artwork is worth much more. I've been telling you to raise them damn prices. That's so sweet. Did he look good? I mean, did you get the number? Yeah, did you get the digits? Well, yeah he was handsome. He's got this accent, like he's from the islands or Africa. Definitely not from around here. Oh my, handsome with an accent. (chuckles) Did you get the digits? No, he's just a customer who came in and bought a painting, nothing more. Do you know how many customers hit on me? Girl, numbers are never exchanged. He probably got a whole family lined up somewhere, and I'm never gonna see them again. So, next subject. Well, all I'm saying is you need to date. Like how long has it been since Marcus' tight ass? I don't know why you're trying to tell me what I need to do, when you have been single since I met you. No, I date. Men just can't keep up with all this. You on the other hand, you don't date. You're single by choice. I'm gonna have to agree with Liyah on that one. You need to date. You're living in this bubble right now, that only consists of work, coffee, and us. It's pretty sad Zaria. [Liyah] Boring. [Candace] There's other guys out here. You're painting is called "Life", right? You should start living it girl. - (leisurely music) - [Liyah] Yes bitch, live a little.

(sighs) (upbeat music) Hi Zaria. Hey, Ike right? Yes, yes, (chuckles), you remember my name (chuckles). How are you? I'm good, I was actually just about to take a little break. Oh, okay. I'll go ahead and shut it down real quick. Lucky me, then. So what's up? I wanted to buy more of your artworks yesterday, but you were not around. Oh yeah, I'm only here like two, three days a week. Always on Saturday, never on Sunday. Okay well, that's good to know. So, which piece were you thinking about buying? Listed price. No interest. Actually, I was looking at buying all of them. Wait, what? I want to buy all your paintings. Funny guy (chuckles). You're serious? Of course I am serious. Now, tell me, what is my grand total? Let me pay. Wow, I don't believe it. Let me start packing them up for you, okay? Okay. Wow (chuckles). (Ike chuckles) So where exactly are you from? Nigeria. Ah, I see. I always wanted to go there. Oh, you should. I'll show you around, and show you a good time. (Zaria chuckles) You'll like it. Wow, won't have much to do tomorrow since you bought out all my artwork, huh? Oh yes. So since I bought your artwork, how about a date? Oh, I'll pass. Why? I mean you said it already, that I already bought your whole artwork. So no excuses, you're free. No thanks. I mean, it's just to show you a good time. You know, that's all. (giggles) No thanks, I'll pass. Wait, is that why you're buying all my artwork? So that you could hook up with me? I put my heart and my soul into all of these works. This isn't something I just do for fun, or for money. No amount of money is worth me having my artwork in someone else's trashcan. No, no, listen, you're getting me all wrong. Did you think you could buy me? That was the purpose of your extra interest? Zee, no. I swear you're getting me all wrong, okay? Listen, your artwork is actually one of the best, and most original artworks I've seen in a while. They're exquisite, just as you are. No offense me trying to buy this and ask you out on a date, no. Okay, that wasn't my intention at all, okay? I was just trying to show you a good time, that's all. Okay, I'm sorry for flipping out on you. I'm kind of embarrassed. It's fine. So what time shall I come pick you up? I just don't think it's a good idea. Come on. You said it yourself, you're free. You don't have that much to sell anymore. I know, but no thanks. Okay, you know what? I'll come back here everyday, and I mean everyday, until I leave back to Nigeria. Good luck with that. (laughs) Okay.

I'm actually just about to pack it up, and head on out. Okay, I can help you then. You're something else. Come on. All I want is to just take this beautiful girl out on a date. Well this beautiful girl's got a little too much on her plate right now, so. Exactly why I'd like to take you out. I can't. Listen Zaria, all I'm asking for is just one date, okay? I won't be here for long. I'll be leaving very soon, okay? I want to have a good time with you, and show you a nice time, that's all. Just one date. You look like you need it as well. Come on, live a little. Fine Ike, one date. - Nice. - That's it. Okay, why don't I book the best restaurant then. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, nothing fancy, just casual will do. One date, one night, that's it. Okay, one date, one night, okay. That's fine. So how about I tell my driver to come pick you up, and... Oh no, no, no, no, no. Once you make the reservation, just shoot me the info. I'll go ahead and meet you there. I know how you like to pop up, so. (laughing) I'm sorry about that. Okay so, I'll get your number. Yeah. There we go. Okay. Let me flash you (chuckles). (Zaria chuckle) That's me. I had a problem, Zaria. No problem. Thank you very much. Have a good night, Ike. Have a good night (laughs). (bangs door) - I'll just... - Oh, sorry. That's okay. I do realize... One more time. There you go. (chuckles) See you, have a good evening. Alright, Ike. (door bangs shut) (soul music) Makeover time. I do not need a makeover. Please, you are going on a date. Now don't get me wrong, you are gorgeous just the way you are, but you need to spice it up tonight. This is not a date. This is a friendly outing, with a nice guy I know absolutely nothing about. Except that he might be a stalker. He is not a stalker. He just knows what he wants. Now, these are a few of my fabulous sexy pieces. Which one do you prefer? None, these are really cute, but I was thinking something a little casual like jeans and a nice blouse. Jeans? No way. If you wanna do casual, meet me somewhere in the middle. Let's do sexy casual. Regardless of how you look at this, it's still a date. And you need to look drop dead gorgeous. Now, try that. It's only one night girl, show out. Alright, alright. I'm not wearing any of those tight dresses. Something casual, just a little sexy. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) Well, you finally got me out. Yes, finally. You're a tough one, though. But I like that. You're very beautiful. Thank you. You look quite dapper yourself. Oh, thank you. I don't really get to go out like this too often. Why is that? Aren't you the one who told me that life is worth living? Well yes, and I'm living life to the fullest, doing everything that makes me happy. So painting makes me happy, hanging out with my friends, my family makes me happy, coffee makes me happy. (chuckles) Well, that's good. What makes you happy? (sighs) Knowing that I can wake up one day, and change the lives of people for the better. I mean that I can wake up and have the power to help the less privileged in the community. That makes me happy. You have a really big heart. And I see that you like to give. Yes, I do. What do you do for a living? Okay, I'm in the family business. We own acres of land, and also a lot of parking spaces in Nigeria. That sounds nice. You have a family back there? Like a wife and a child? Yes, I have family back home. A mother and a father. (Ike and Zaria laughing) You got jokes. Of course, would you think if I had a wife and children at home, that I wouldn't tell you on the first date? Of course I would. In this day and age, with these type of men, anything is possible. But I'm not really worried about it. You're not pursuing me, and this isn't even a date. This is just a casual evening out. Point of correction. I am pursuing you, and I am not like most men. I'm the real deal. (smooth background music) [Waitress] Let me get this our of your way. [Ike] Thank you.

Yeah, busy dodging us all month. So you really like them, huh? Yes, I really do guys. He's like a breath of fresh air. And I know I've been distant, but isn't this what we wanted? For me to date. [Candace] Of course. We told you to date, not go MIA. Look, I'm sorry about that last time, but I'm here now. So let's be happy for Zaria, huh Liyah? I'm happy, I do think you're moving a bit faster. Well I can't help that I love him. I'm sorry, did you say love? I guess I did. I've never even told him that, just kind of slipped out. But what if this is love. And see when I was saying you were moving a little fast, I wasn't even talking about on this level. Now you're saying you're in love with a man who's on vacation from Africa. Okay Liyah, let me stop you. 'Cause you're coming off a bit too strong. Zaria, we want you to be happy. And we have no problem with Ike. And we don't want you to get too caught up. He's not even a two hour flight away, he's from Nigeria. Like a whole other country. What are his intentions? I've never asked him. We haven't discussed it. We've been so caught up in the moment. Exactly, caught him in a moment with a man who you'll never even see once he leaves. Then you'll be all heartbroken, and then I'll feel obligated to go to Nigeria and whip his ass. We don't want you to get hurt Zaria. We support you 100%, but we wouldn't be the real friends if he didn't care. (slow music) (Ike laughs) This guy man. He is hilarious. What's wrong? You're not even enjoying the movie, or even laughing. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just not really into this one. Oh, okay. I could change it then. No, don't worry about it. Just watch the movie Ike. Are you sure? Yes, I'm fine. Just watch it, it's fine. (sigh) You know Zaria, I want to talk to you about something. Okay, what? I enjoy our time together, and I know one day it's all gonna come to an end, since I'm going back to Nigeria. But the truth is, I don't want this to end. I don't want it to end either. So come back to Nigeria with me. What? I'm serious, come back to Nigeria with me. You'll not regret it. Ike, I can't. I can't just jet off on some plane, and leave my family my friends behind. Don't worry, listen, your family they can visit anytime they want to. It'll be fine. Ike, I can't. Do you trust me. I do. Then believe me when I say, you will not regret it. Not one bit. I'll take care of you. Look, this is a lot for me to think about in one night, okay? I mean, just go home and get some rest, and I'll talk to you tomorrow. Have a good night. (phone rings) Hey Ike. Why are you calling me so early in the morning? Wait, what? You're outside? Okay, look I'm coming. Alright. Zaria, sorry I notice it's very late, but this can't wait. There's one thing I forgot to tell you. Just one thing. Zaria, I am crazy love with you. I love you so much, I don't even know how to control my feelings anymore. I ask you again, please come back with me to Nigeria. But this time, not as my girlfriend, but as my fiancee. Zaria, will you marry me? Yes. Yes? Yes. Yes? Here let me put this on first.

Well yeah, I did. But what's going on with you two? Zaria, what's going on? (Zaria giggles) Oh my God. What is this? Did Ike give you that? Yes, he proposed and I accepted. Have you lost your damn mind? Well you guys look, we love each other. And, I'm going to Nigeria with. Look, we'll be traveling back and forth, and you guys want to visit whenever you want. This is what we want, and we're in love. And what I'd like from you two, is to support my decision. Okay look, I gotta run, but I love y'all. I mean, Candace, how much do we know about this Ike guy anyways? He's taking her out of the country. He can turn completely crazy the minute they step off the plane. Be running a Nigerian scam on our girl. I know, but what can we do? I mean, she's happy. Nah, something ain't right. I can feel it in my gut. What does he do for a living? I think he works for his family, like they own some business or something. What's his government name? I don't know, if you're trying to look him up, he doesn't that social media. Well, that's a red flag right there. Everyone has social media. Well, I don't know. I don't know what to say, but I need to get out of here. I need to get back to the boutique, so. I will talk to you later. (bass music) (upbeat music) Hey, what's up girl? Wait, wait, slow down, what? What? Okay, no wait hold on, let me call you back, okay. (upbeat music) Do you think I should bring some more stuff? I don't even know what to bring. I mean, should I dress like the girls over there, or I mean is this enough? (Ike laughs) You'll be fine, okay. I'm sure what you have right now is okay. Better still, we can buy an entire wardrobe when you get to Nigeria. Buy an entire wardrobe, how rich are you? What about your parents? You think there'll be okay with you bring some fiance home for New Orleans? My parents will be fine. I'm sure they'll fall in love with you the moment they see you. Zaria, there's something I'd like to discuss with you. Yeah, okay, what? You see, back home. (door knock) My God, who is that? (door knock) Okay, okay, my God. Jesus, hello? Okay, well hey. Ike is here. Alright, we all can get to know Ike a little bit better... Oh I think we know enough. Okay, what the hell does that mean Liyah? Zariah, Ike is a fraud. (Zariah laughs) - What? - What the hell are you talking about? Look Zaria, I know you're ready to run off and get married, but we saw some things online about Ike. Apparently you're a prince, and you're getting married next month. And as you can see from the picture, that's him. I'm sorry Zaria, but you had to know the truth. What is this? Listen Zaria, I can explain all this. No you can't. You're a liar, cheater and a manipulator Liyah, stop. You hurt my best friend, and right now after like kicking your Nigerian ass. I think you should leave. (door knock) Who is it? Marcus? What the hell are you even doing here? Did you steal those flowers for my neighbor? Zaria, look I know it's been a minute, but when Liyah told me everything that was going on with you, just figured... Really, really? Look, I know how vulnerable you are. I couldn't sit back and let you hurt like that. I want you to know that I'm here as long as you need me to be. (Zaria laughs) Need you? I don't need you. Never have, and never will. You are the most arrogant, narcissistic, manipulative, asshole that I've ever met. And you can take that little fake ass monologue, and those stolen flowers, and get out of my house. Now! Or do you want me to walk you out? Nah, I'm good. (door creaks open) What the hell were you thinking? What, I'm looking out for you and you're mad at me? You know everything that I went through with Marcus. Did you hear what he just said to me? This is my life. My personal business. He has no right to even be involved, no reason at all. And you're supposed to be my girl. If you were gonna offer me a shoulder to cry on, it should have been your own. This right here, very disrespectful. I got nothing else to say to you. Okay, wow, this is what I get for looking out for you> You so damn ungrateful. This is why you always end up in these situations, karma. - No, no, no, no. - Just get out of my house. - Really? - Yes, really. - Really, after all this? - Yes, really. - Really? - Everything. Just get out my house. Man, get off me. Just leave. Zaria, calm down, okay? Calm down, I know you're upset right now. And I'm really sorry how this night went, but please, calm down. Just, I need everyone to leave. Get out of my house, everyone. The prince and I need to have a conversation. - Zaria... - Out! Just... Let me explain everything to you, please. What? I'm sorry about this whole thing, it's... Okay, let me ask you a question. Are you a prince? Yes. Do you have a fiance? I don't love her. Answer the question. Technically yes, but it is you I love, okay. I don't love her. Just get away from me. Zaria, please... Ike get out. - Zaria please. - I wish you the best, but I need you to get out of my house right now. Just let me explain. Out!

But is that what you really want Zaria? I mean, after everything you two shared, I think you owe him that much, to just hear what he has to say. I mean who knows, maybe you two can be friends. I don't know. Well, whatever happens between you two, we support it 100%, right Liyah? Right. Thanks, guys. ♪ I ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ Me ♪ ♪ He ♪ ♪ We ♪ ♪ Our ♪ ♪ World ♪ (slow piano music) Hello Zaria? Back to stalking I see. Just hear me out, okay? Please, hear my truth before I go back to Nigeria. I came to America for my bachelor get away. Yes, I must get married once I get back to Nigeria. But that's an arranged marriage. I did not choose her. I came here to fit into a different life. Live like a normal person, meet new people, make new friends. So I hid my identity. I made it so private that sometimes I forget who I really am, a prince. I didn't come here to look for love. But I found it, and it found me. We found each other. And now I can do without you. How come you just didn't tell me the truth, when you start falling in love with me? Our whole relationship has been built on lies, I don't know anything about you, and you know everything about me. That's not true Zaria. You know the best parts of me. So what was gonna happen when we got back to Nigeria Ike? We're just gonna have one big wedding, with me on one arm and the princess on another? (Ike laughs) I'm not laughing Ike? No Zaria, I'm sorry. Listen, you're the only one my heart beats for. You're the only woman for me. And once I get back to Nigeria, the entire kingdom will know this. The worst part of me wants to tell you to go enjoy your life, with that funky princess of yours. But the best part of me, wants to continue the moments that we share and love you forever. (Ike laughs) So tell me, can I have the best parts of you? I'm not going back to Africa with you Ike, not yet. First, you have to go home and explain to all your family and friends exactly what happened. And you need to tell your ex fiance, that there's a new fiance in the picture. Yes, yes, yes and yes, I will do exactly everything you want, okay? And once I'm done clearing this with my parents, I will send a ticket for you to come to Nigeria. And one more thing, don't ever take this off again, please. I love you so much my princess. I love you too. (slow music) ♪ So high ♪ Have a safe flight. Thank you. Don't go anywhere, okay. I'll send a flight booking to you very soon. I love you. Love you. Call me when you get there.

(laughs) Okay, I'll see you. I can't wait to see you too. Bye bye mom. (upbeat african music) (phone ringing tone) Come on, pick up. Why is he not picking? They said he was back. Why is he not picking? (slow music) (phone ringing tone) Well son, tell us about your trip. Oh yes, how did you end America? It was nice, wonderful experience. I plan to visit there more often. No, not too soon then. At least when we are done with the wedding. Oh by the way, have you spoken to Princess? Mom, please come on. I just got back. Can we talk about this like some other time please. Let's talk about something else. Yeah so Dad, how's the family business? How's it going? Well, everything is fine. [Queen] I missed you though. I missed you too mum. (Ike laughs) Everything is under control in the kingdom. Yes (laughs) That's good to know. Guys, good to see you guys. - Tito. - My prince. Welcome, welcome. Ladies. Ada. (foreign language) - You're welcome. - Thank you. Feels good to be home. I know, home sweet home. (king laughs) Ada. Yes your Majesty. Please get my son out of those clothes. Yes your Majesty, Thank you. - My prince. - Okay. Alright, you're all dismissed. (upbeat african music) Your Majesty, is your son not funny. (king laughs) He goes to America for three months, and he has forgotten who he is. Hilarious, isn't he? You know, but Queen don't worry your head. Don't worry your pretty head. He's now back, and it's time to take care of business. (king laughs) [Ada] Your highness, it is good to have you back. You were missed. (Ike laughs) You were missed as well. Strange though, but exciting having (mumbles) For the past three months. Feels good. You don't have to worry about that anymore. Well, I think I'm already getting used to doing things myself now. So my Prince, how was it in New Orleans? Oh, it was amazing. I met this beautiful. It was really fun. That was why we didn't hear from you. - (Ike laughs) - Well... Your highness. I like this. Thank you Ada. You're welcome, Your Highness. Leave it there. Okay Your Highness. Your Highness, Darren is here. My friend Darren, - so good to see you. - Thank you beautiful. Your welcome. My man, my guy. Oh man, good to see you. Good to see you too. - How have you been? - Welcome back. I'm good, I'm good. Welcome back. Thanks, thank you for coming. Please have a seat. Do we have some beautiful women around here. So how was your trip? It was wonderful. Better than I expected. The most interesting trip I have ever had in my entire life. I'll put it that way. And I met someone. What, a woman? - Yes a woman. - Just one? Of course, and listen. I think I love her. (Darren laughs) I've heard about American women, but love? (Darren laughs) I'm serious Darren. Wait a minute. When you say love, what exactly are you implying? I mean, I want to marry her. But the thing is, I don't know to break this to my parents right now. Because all of a sudden, they started talking about wedding plans with the princess. I knew your ass should never have gone to the America, (Darren laughs) You meet one beautiful woman, and now you're ready to throw the entire kingdom into shambles? Well, thank you very much Darren. That's really helpful. Well listen hey, I am not sure what you should do. But I do know this will not go well with your family, and especially the princess. I know Darren. But the thing is, this woman, she's special. Oh I see, she has put a spell on you huh? No, I'm serious okay. I feel so incomplete without her. When I'm with her, nothing else matters. She doesn't care about the Prince. All she cares about is Ikena. I feel like I should bring her back here, and make her my princess. So what do I do? Marry her? Just let me know how that conversation goes with your parents, and the princess. 'Cause I do not plan on sticking around for it. (slow jazz music) Your Majesty, The Prince. Thank you very much Zika. You may leave. Thank you, Your Majesty. Father, mother, you called. We have some few things to discuss. The royal wedding. We called for you several times today. And you were so busy not to have answered, what's going on? Have you called the Princess? No, I have not. Why not? What's your explanation? Look, I know you won't understand what I'm about to say, but please hear me out. I do not wish to marry the princess. What? I forbid you. I forbid you. Are you completely out of your mind? No father, I am not. What nonsense is that you're spewing out of your mouth. I am in love father, but not with the princess. Oh, at this point I want to sit down. You're sitting down mother. Really, am I? So, who is this woman you claim to be in love with? Father, her name is Zaria. She is from New Orleans. We shouldn't have sent him overseas? I do not wish to hear this anymore, not in this palace, or anywhere in this kingdom. You are the heir apparent to the throne. You own the throne an allegiance and the responsibility. Mind you, you will uphold that responsibility. Ikena, you have to marry Princess. If there is anything you're holding on to from America, please let it go. You may leave. (slow music) (phone vibrating) Hello, Princess. - Yes. - Hi Prince. I know I was tired when I got back. I don't think that's a good idea. I actually need to be alone for a few days, to get some things off my head. I don't want to be disturbed, okay? Don't worry, it's all okay, I'm fine. Alright, have a good night. (slow music) I have spoken to Princess. Did you tell her about Zaria. Excuse me. Of course she didn't tell her about Zaria. Why would she bother to upset her with irrelevant news? In any case, you are still marrying the Princess. She told me that you needed some space. What space do you need from your soon to be wife? Look, father, mother, I thought about this all night. My decision still stands. I don't want to marry the Princess. I want to marry Zaria. You ruin everything, everything. Do you not understand what is at stake here? Bringing these two kingdoms together will fortify our positions financially, greater. I will not approve of this little love affair. Then I'll leave. If I can't marry the woman I love, then I'll move to America, and I'll stay there. You'll do no such thing. Oh yes, I will father. I do not want the throne, if I can't marry the woman that completes me. Meaning you are willing to throw away everything. How much do you love this woman? So much father. I truly do. I would like to meet this woman. Bring her here. - Mother. - Ikena, it's okay. Invite her over, and everything will be fine, okay? Thank you. - Ada. - My Prince. Your Highness you're so excited. What is it about? Ada, can you remember that lady I told you about I met in New Orleans? Yes, I do. She arrives today. Your Highness, am I missing something. Well, her name is Zaria, and I love her dearly. And she's coming here to be my wife. What about the princess? What about the royal wedding? Well Ada, let's just say, love conquers all. And yes, they'll be a royal wedding. I'm happy for you. I knew something was a bit different about you since you returned. And yes Ada, when she gets here, don't worry about me. I need you to be at her hands and feet at all times. Take good care of her. I will do that my prince. Thank you Ada. (upbeat music) It will be okay. With our luck, the love, the thoughts they had, they have faded away. (planes engine roaring) [Announcer] Boarding call for passengers Please proceed to gate three. This is the final call for gate three. (announcer mumblers) [Male Announcer] This is the final call flight 17. (announcer mumbling) - Zaria. - Hi. - Zaria. - Hey. (Zaria and Ike laugh) Oh look at you. Wow, I've missed you. I missed you so much. Wow, that looks good on you. Sure does. So why don't we get out of here. Yes. Guard take those luggage. So tell me, how was your flight. [Zaria] It was good, not too bad actually. Wow. [Ike] I know, I know. Driving is definitely different. Yup, it's an adventure here. This is amazing. Yes it is. So you like? More like love. (Ike laughs) I never thought I'd be able to come here, and then to be here with you is just perfect. Yes it is. I'm glad you're here. Me too. Do you think your parents will like me. Oh of course, I'm sure they will like you. (mumbles) What's that? Wow, this place is amazing. I can't believe you live in a place like this. Yes I do. It comes with the title. Please this way, let me show you to my father. You see this palace was passed down, down generations on to my father. My great grandfather who was the King Ogi, very popular, very strong, well known in the community, he was know to be a very generous man. He was awarded this painting by our villagers, but that will be for later. Come this way. They are great men. (upbeat music) Father, mother. Please meet Zaria. Hi, Your Majesty. She's beautiful. So you are Zaria. So you are the one who has completely swept my son of his feet. Do you love him, as much as he loves you? Yes of course, Ike means everything to me. Ikena, Prince Ikena. Prince Ikenya. Mother. So what are your intentions? Well, I wanna spend my life with Prince Ikenya. He's the most humble, and loving, and noble man that I've ever met. And he has a big heart. I can't picture my life without him. Okay, I've heard enough. I guess you had a long flight. You need a good rest. Both of you are dismissed. She's really fond of him. I think she loves him. She spoke highly of him. She is a lovely lady. Oh yes, but my dear queen. This is all wrong. He cannot marry her. (slow music) Well, that went okay, right? Yes, you did great. At least now they can see what I see in you. I got weird vibes from your father. I don't think he likes me. But your mom smiled at me. Oh trust me, my father likes you. He just has a very tough exterior, but I'm sure its the work, or business actually stressing him out, but he likes you. What about the princess you're supposed to marry? How did she take it? Ada, please can you make her room, okay? Arrange a room for her. Okay Your Highness. Zaria, I told you before. That was supposed to be an arranged marriage. No feelings involved. So she is fine. I only have feelings for one woman only. Why are you so good to me? (slow love music) Because you deserve it. Now go freshen up, okay? See you at dinner. Okay. (door creaks shut) No, you don't have to do that for me Ada. I'm just a regular girl from New Orleans, I can manage. You are the future wife of the Prince. He asked me to take care of you, and that I will do. Thank you, I appreciate it. Your welcome. So how long have you been living here in the palace? Since I was a child. Wow, that's a long time. So you knew Ike when he was little. He has always been wonderful. I had an amazing time growing up in the palace. Prince Ikena, he's always getting into things. Really? Yes, but that was a long time ago. He has learnt a lot, manners and etiquette. He's grown into a fine young man. Yes, definitely he's a fine young man in every sense of the word. And you are good for him. I see it in him. Thanks, that means a lot. You're welcome. Go ahead, get your beauty rest. I'll see you later. Thank you Ada. You're welcome. I cannot believe you brought the American woman here to be your wife, and you're still standing. (laughs) She'll be out shortly. Zaria has to freshen up. So come on tell me, how did The King and The Queen take the news. It was pretty bad I must say, but they saw how strong my love is for her, and they're coming around slowly. I have to make sure of that. So what is going to happen now? Is she officially going to be the new Princess? And how did our Princess take the news? Well yes, Zaria is going to be our new Princess. But as for the Princess, I haven't told her anything yet. What? Now I see why you have no bruises yet. I mean, eventually I'll tell her. But for now, I actually want to just, let her give me space, so I can get my parents on board. They are the main people I need to actually get on board. Your Highness, Zaria. Wow, I need to take the trip to America now. (Darren laughs) You look beautiful. Thank you. My good friend, Darren. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. I've heard great things about you. Thank you, I've heard great things about you too. So, when are your friends arriving? My friends? Please, pay him no mind okay. Just ignore him, he's like that. I mean, if they look as good as you, what can I say? (Darren and Zaria laughing) Your Highness The King and Queen requested to see you alone. Okay, thank you Ada. I'll be there shortly. It was a pleasure. - Ike, - No problem my friend. I'll talk with you later. - I'll see you later. - Take care. Well, I guess I'll just sit here and wait for you, while you meet with The King and Queen. Oh, that's nonsense. I'll have my driver take you shopping, then you can buy whatever he want. Ada, Ada will escort you. Ada please make sure she buys whatever she wants. And mind you, she's a stubborn one. Okay, Your Highness. Okay, I'll see you later then. Girls day out? Yes, sounds good. Come on, I have a lot of places to show you. I've been wanting to do some shopping. (upbeat music) Zika. Yes, Your Majesty, Can you please give us a moment alone with our son? Yes, Your Majesty. So son, how is Zaria enjoying her stay with us? Very well mother. We're excited that we're spending time together. And I can't wait to make her my wife. You're still considering making her your wife. Of course, Zaria would be our Princess. Son, have you thoroughly thought about this? I mean, Zaria is not from here. And the title is all about true loyalty and responsibility to this kingdom. You will be taking away from her people, her family, her home and her friends. Mother Zaria and I have talked about this over and over again. She knows exactly what she's stepping into, which is why she's here. Enough son, you are making a very big mistake. How dare you threaten to abandon the throne, if we don't cooperate with your demands. I am The King. Does this mean nothing to you? Of course it does, father. It means a lot to me. I'm also hoping that one day, when I take on the throne, I'll be a great king, just as you are. But Zaria means more than that to me. Everything is not about money and power father. I personally think she's no good for you. That's a lie father. Mother, you can see she's good. I don't think your father is saying that she's not good. No, it's just about this title. This is not tradition, plans have been put in place for the betterment of this kingdom. She's not good for any of us. In fact, my hands are tied, and I just can do anything but to accept this nonsense. But let me remind you my son, you have utterly disappointed me. Ikena, is Princess aware of all this? No, not yet. I guess you have to tell everyone about this changes. I don't think they'll be pleased, at all. [Ada] Let me help you with that. No, even when I marry Prince, I'm not gonna let you carry my things for me Ada. I like you. So tell me, what is it that you do back in New Orleans? Well, I'm an artist. So I paint. That's actually how Ike and I met. He bought quite a few of my paintings. That was your paintings. They are beautiful. Your amazing. Thank you. You actually make a good Princess. Just for the palace needs. You think so? Yes, I know so. Where is Tito? I know I told him he didn't have to come inside, but I didn't think he'd leave us. Me too. You know what, just wait here. Let me check through the the backdoor. The Price usually exits through the backdoor. So just stay, I'm coming. (car tires screech) No, no, no. Get in. (Zaria screams) (car tires screech) Oh my God. Your Highness, they took Zaria. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Ada, what do you mean she's missing. I don't know, they just came from nowhere. Ada, I asked you to watch over her. And where was bodyguard (mumbles). Your Highness, she said the guards shouldn't come with us. Ada, I'm going to send out guards to you. Ada, make sure you find her. Find her. [Ada] Okay. You did very well. Thank you. Yes, trust me, everything will go according to plan, okay? I temporarily disabled all the cameras, so there won't be any footages. You know what to do from here. Yes Your Princess. Let's go. (upbeat music) It is done. Ada, what have we done? What do you mean? Tito, this is no time feel regret. It is done. She's our princess, not Zaria. No but, don't you love me. You know I do, very much. Well listen to me. You will never see the light of the day, if you open your mouth about this. Everything we worked for will be gone. Is that what you want? Tell me? No my love. I don't think so. So we stick to the plan. Do you hear me? So we have some spare time before the guards arrive, if you know what I mean. What, do you want to show me something I always do. (mumbling) Hi, Zaria? Who the hell are you? The woman you're trying to be. What? Why am I tied up? Where am I? Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to get rid of you? You know, I've been thinking why my fiance just kept ignoring my calls? Why he just started acting so different? And then I realized that he brought home another woman, and didn't even tell me. I had to walk in on him kissing another woman. How the hell do you think that would make me feel? You're the Princess. Yes, I'm the Princess, and you the imposter. No, you're a psycho bitch. You're not getting away with this. Of course I'm not getting away with this. You know, I can just kill you right now and end it all. Or just allow you to rot I here for the rest of your miserable life. Or if I'm being nice, I could just let you go back to America where you belong. But no, you just have to die. Just put the gun down. You don't wanna do this. It's not worth it, not over man. You know you're right, I don't want to get my hands (mumbles). So I'm going to leave you in here, so you can rot for the rest of your miserable life. No, no, please, don't leave me. (Zaria sobs) We have searched everywhere, Zaria can't be found, and her phone is switched off. She may have left. Father, as much as I know you want that to happen. Zaria would never leave. And you two, I can't believe you let this happen. I don't understand. Your Highness, I'm so sorry. I do not understand either. She was there, and all of a sudden she was not there anymore. There was no surveillance? No, all the cameras seem to be off. Today of all days. Oh, come down my son. Tito and Ada did their best, yet she ran off. This is what I keep saying, that she is not fit to be a Princess. If she really loves you, she'll return. But considering how strange this situation is, I doubt it, I doubt that this can happen. Zaria would not leave me. My fiancee's missing. I meant to protect her, and I failed. We tried our best my Prince. Ada, Tito, - My Queen. - Leave us alone. Mother, Zaria will not just up and leave like that. She wouldn't run away. Where does she know, she's going to? She doesn't know anywhere. I understand Son, I do understand. Well, we'll keep up the search for her. But I want you to do something for me. I want you to prepare yourself both mentally and emotionally, just in case she does not return. My Queen, this is chaos. Please, you can be a little sensitive here. He's hurting. (mysterious music) Hi Zaria. How is your night? Please, please just let me go. I just wanna go back home. You could have my phone, I won't even call Ike. I just wanna go back home, please. I just wanna go home. (Princess laughs) Wow, is that you begging me? No, I don't think so. 'Cause as long as you're free, you're going to run off to Ike, and I can't stand getting caught. I won't, just think about it. You can't keep me locked up here forever. If you let me go, then you don't ever have to see me again. And you think I'm stupid. Look, I promise. I won't ever come back here. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fine, fine, I'll let you go. But after I drop this. This is Nigeria, and I own the police, judiciary, anything you can think of. I own them. They're all at my beck and call, so do not try anything stupid. Try anything shitty, and I will end your life with just a phone call. Am I clear? Yes. Good. (phone dialing pad tone) Find me her passport, and bring it to me. Your Highness, do you really want to let her go? It's not part of the plan. (slow african music) Ikena, you have to eat. You have not eaten anything in two days. How can I mother, my fiancee is missing. We have searched the entire kingdom but can't find her. She just disappeared like that. It doesn't add up. No it doesn't add up. You have to eventually contact her family. I think so too. She could be headed home. I don't know how, but there is a possibility. What if she's not mother? They'll look at me in shame, that I brought her to our kingdom and can't protect her. Well, we'll keep searching till she's found. Meanwhile, you have to eat something, please. Excuse me. [Announcer] Your attention please. Please do not smoke in the terminal building. Smoking is only permitted in the specified smoking areas. Thank you. (Announcer mumbles) Here, this is everything you'll be needing. And that will help me get everything I need to know about you, before you get on that flight. (slow african music) (owl hooting) (birds chirping) Your Royal Majesty, my Queen, my Prince, I believe I have some news that you will be interested in. But first, I submit myself to the consequences of my actions. I have to confess, before it's too late. It's about Zaria. (upbeat mysterious music) Don't bother making calls, they won't go through. And once you see a call on that phone you pick it. 'Cause that will be me calling you. Don't try anything funny. You can go. (slow african music) (owl hooting) (birds chirping) Zaria. Zaria. I can't. I can't do this, my friends were right. We just took everything too fast. I'm on a whole different continent, with people who I don't even know or trust. And the one person who I thought was my friend, just sold me out at the mall. Your parents don't even like me. They didn't even say two words to me. And your Princess, locked me up in a dungeon, tied me up and put a gun to my head because you didn't have the balls to tell her about me before I got here. Who am I supposed to trust now. Zaria please I am sorry. Before you know how hurt I am on the inside. Yes, you deserves to go on that plane and never look back again. Go back to New Orleans. But please, I don't want that. If I had any idea that your life was in danger, I would have eliminated every threat, including Ada. Zariah, all I know in my heart is that I love you. I love you enough to get on that plane with you, and head back to New Orleans and never look back. Start a fresh, a new life. If it's worth keeping you. I know that you love me Ike, and you didn't mean to intentionally hurt me. But we're from two different worlds. I can't let you give up everything just to go back with me. You're gonna be a king. You have responsibilities and duty to your family. Enough. Guards, take these two away. Your Highness please. Your Highness, no, no, no. What? - Your Highness. - Take them away. Madam please. (princess wailing) I was wrong. Excuse me? I was wrong about you, the love that two of you do share is undoubtedly undeniable. In fact, both of you do remind me of my dear Queen and I, 30 years ago, when we're younger, and in love. You see, our marriage was arranged, but I've been given this lovely woman as my Queen. In fact, I fell in love with unconditionally. Actually, it didn't take us too long to fall in love with each other entirely. And same love I can see both of you, if not greater. So, my dear daughter, I am deeply sorry for everything that you went through. Certainly, you do not deserve such. So, from now on, I promise you, I'll make everything better for you. I don't know what to say. - Ike. - Zaria. I'm sorry. Zaria please. Please Zaria. I guess I'm gonna stay here for a while. (upbeat music) Enough both of you, we have a wedding to plan.
