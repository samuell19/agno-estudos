Come on. I'm sorry. Okay now yearbooks are forever. Look serious. Okay. All right. All right. Hold it now. Hey janey, keep your arms down! Come on, pump them! All right, mean. Tell me I'm gonna coach girls' track for the rest of my life. Come on Molly, this gag photo for the vearbook was your idea. What the hell is going on here? Who gave you permission to you use my uniform? Hi, Dan. Oh Moll. Sorry, babes. Didn't know it was you. No problem. Anytime you wanna get into my pants, just ask. I never had sisters before. So long babes. What a guy. Come on, girls. Keep your stride nice and easy. Let's go. Get your arms down! Hey Moll, our fearless leader has returned. Who? Walker. Go on, go ask him now before somebody else does. Go get him, tiger! Okay, okay. Dr. Walker! Miss Mcgrath! For a second I thought you were Bubba Smith. They look fine. You look fine, girls. Get those arms up. How was the principals' conference? Very stimulating. Good, good. Dr. Walker, an interesting thing happened when you were away. Nick Martinelli went in for a double hernia. Yeah, and I don't think he's gonna be able to coach JV football this year. And I, well I'd like the job. I tell you what, run it by Dan Darwell. If he doesn't have any objections, it's fine with me. Young lady, keep those knees pumping! Knees and arms, girls, knees and arms. I got to ask Dan. Oh well, the worst he can do is say no. He could say, no, babes. Hey, you wanna know the best way to do this? Yeah. don't talk to him about it now. not now? I like that. Tell him you want to meet him later. Later, good. Sort of a date, he'll love it. No, I'm not going on a date with him. Tell him you want to meet him after practice. Remember the time I told you I went with the jacuzzi and the whole thing? Just bring it up real nice and easy. I'm not going on a date with him. How badly do you wanna coach football? I can't. I have to pick the kids up. I'll pick the kids up. I'm warmed up. Okay. Ready? I need to talk to you, Dan. Sure, babes. How about over dinner? How about over racquetball? Okay. A quick set, then dinner. We'll play to five. Ladies first, you serve. I want to coach the JV, Dan. Molly, a girl can't coach boys' football. You know that. No, I don't. My serve. Dan, I can handle this, believe me. Heads up! One-zip. Supposed to hit the ball, not the wall, babes. Dan, I was raised on football. I know more about the sport than anybody else you could get. I mean, coaching to me is like... Heads up! You know I'm qualified, Dan. I've known you and Dr. Walker a long time now. And I'm sure you wouldn't discriminate against me just because I'm a woman. Hey, you know me, babes, I'm a modern guy, but Walker, I don't know. Let's see what he says. We'll meet with him on Monday. Thanks, Dan. shit. What's the score? Two-one, mine. It's three-one, yours. oh. Oh Dan, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. Good game. We'll play again when I don't have a headache. See you later. You're not sore at me, are you? No fine, everything's fine. We're still going to meet with Walker and everything on Monday? Yeah, yeah, first thing Monday morning. I promise. Okay. You're not upset? I'm fine. Now get out of here, you knucklehead. Okay. Mom, I lost my sneaker. Put on your sandals. Verna, I found dad's playbooks. Then I'm not going. Alice! What? Help your sister find her shoe. Why do I have to? Because she's 6, you're 13. And as you get older, life gets tougher. Look at the way dad blocked the sweep series. Boy, he was way ahead of his time. I love this play. Hey, mom, I found Marian's shoe. President Muffley had it. Little son of a bitch also ate my Duran Duran album. What'd you say? Verna said it's okay to call a dog a son of a bitch, because that's what he is. Verna. I can't believe I said that, but it is linguistically correct. I got it. Hey, Frank. Hey, Verna. How you doing? My lips are above the water line. That's very funny. Hey, Moll, what's happening? Hey, what's with all that? Finally getting around to throwing that stuff out huh? Yeah, I'm just throwing all that out. Daddy! Hi, sweetie. Muffinhead. Kids! We're going shopping! Guys, call me every night, okay? It's just the weekend. Well, humor me. Bye, baby. Bye, mom, see you Sunday. I love you. Bye, honey, I love you. Bye, mom. Bye. Oh, by the way, Stephanie's parents are having a cocktail party Sunday night so I'm gonna have to drop the kids off a little earlier than usual, like 2:30 P.M. Okay? Thanks. Bye! Why didn't you tell him about the coaching? cause I know him. He'd put it down, try to talk me out of it. So I decided to get tough, stand up to him, and deny it. Anyway, I'll tell him Monday after I get the job. I'm really very sorry Miss Mcgrath. But if the position has been filled, there's nothing I can do about it. Coach Darwell is perfectly within his rights to select Mr. Remo as his JV coach. But he's the home ec teacher. And a darn good one, too. Mr. Remo, do you know what a nickel defense is, or an open set formation, or when to use a safety blitz? Well I can't say I do. How about penetration? Do you know how to get good penetration? Miss Mcgrath, please. We're drifting off the subject here. Sorry I'm late. What did I miss? Dr. Walker was just explaining to me why you picked someone, no disrespect, Mr. Remo, who doesn't know diddlysquat about football. Hey, you wanna coach football? You really want to coach football? Fine, you got it. What are you talking about? You said I could coach JV. Because, she's going to coach varsity. The big v. What? Jesus, Dan, don't... At Central High. Oh, my god. I spoke to their principal this morning. If Miss Mcgrath is willing to take no bonus over her teachers pay, they'd love to have her. Here's his number. Ben Edwards. Dan, Dan, I don't think that central is the right place for a woman. She can handle it. Can't you, Moll? Besides, maybe a woman's touch is just what they need. After she teaches them to sit, she can take the thorns out of their paws. You think that's real funny, don't you? Yes. Okay, okay laughing boy. Well ha, ha, ha. I'm going to take that job. You think a woman can't be tough enough? I'll show you tough. Watch me. I forgot my purse. Help! Mr. Edwards? Yoo hoo? Mr. Edwards. Hey, come on, stop all that noise. You damned dogs. Hey, how are you? Fine. I bet you're Molly Mcgrath. Ben Edwards. Molly Mcgrath. Right. Come on in. I want to apologize for the puppies. I went out to chain them up before you came, but they got away from me. Are those puppies always here? No, just when the armed guards are off. I have some stats here that you might be interested in. Oh great! It's play diagrams from our touchdown plays from last year. That is wonderful, thank you. Players' reports, things you might need. Great. Oh I just wanna thank you. I appreciate this so much, you taking this chance on me. Right. How about some peanut brittle? We have a little left from last year's fund-raising drive. No, thanks. I'm too fired up to eat. Well you got some real talent here. A little raw, perhaps but I think with the help of my assistant coaches... mmmm. no assistant coaches? Right. Well look, school starts in a week, so we better start practice right away, other wise, we're not gonna be able to... mmmm. No practice? I wouldn't even know how to round the guys up. But if it's any consolation to you, a number of our players are returning from last year, so maybe it wouldn't take too much coaching. Your team only won one game last year, and that's 'cause the other team's bus broke down. Yeah, that victory party was something to see. Mr. Edwards, let's second-think this for a bit. Miss Mcgrath. Are you sure I'm the right person for this job? Hey, Dan Darwell told me that you were eminently qualified. He also tells me that it's your lifetime dream to coach football. Is that right? That's right. Well if word got around that you chickened out on this job, you think anybody would ever offer you another chance? Yes? No. Right. Hey coach, aren't you late for practice? I was just going. Are you nervous? No. Well, a little. I don't blame you. Hey, what are you guys doing? Excuse me. Wait a minute. You guys want to fight? Okay, go ahead. Punch each other's head off. Doesn't make any difference. Only tell your mother you don't have a principal anymore. You got a parole officer. Understood? Right. Suited up and ready to play, coach. Be on the five in field minutes. Oh, god. All right, listen up! If you're not here to play football, then clean out your lockers and leave now. I like her tits. You. You're in training as of right now. Put that out. All right. Now I don't intend to coach a bunch of losers. Now, if you're not willing to work hard! She has a really cute ass, you notice that? Guys, look. I was raised on this sport. It's part of me and I know that I can help you learn the game the game and win. And I think that with, if we just learn to trust each other, there's nothing that we can't do. I mean, I'll help you, I'll be there. I just need for you to give me a chance. Now, what do you say? Line up for calisthenics! Do you guys want to play football or not? Man, come on. Listen to her. come on! We start out by stretching our hams. Right foot over left, and hang. What is this? You said we were gonna play football. Yeah, what's up with that? You can't play if you get hurt. And if you're not properly conditioned... Zip that shit. You tell us when you want us to play football, sweetheart. Hey, hey, what's happening, fellas? What you doing here, Bird? Are you lost or something? So, you're the coach. I am. Who are you? Ain't no thing, baby. I'm just a football fan. Don't be too rough on these girls over here, cause they really ain't got the stomachs for all that physical activity. Hey, Bird. You got a walkman? Look I'm out of walkmans, but I got casios. Come see the Bird. What you wanna give me for this here? Are they coming back? Yeah, if there's a scrimmage here tomorrow. There will be a scrimmage here tomorrow at four o'clock! Now you guys want to show them up at scrimmage tomorrow? He's our quarterback. They're the best guys we got. All the more reason to run rings around them. Now tell me this, do you want to play football? Yeah. No, I can't hear you! Do you wanna play football? Yeah. Don't wear yourselves out. I can't go back there tomorrow, it's a disaster. I'm gonna call Edwards tonight and tell him I can't do this. Darwell has a pool you know. Darwell bought a pool? No, he's got everybody betting on how long you'll last. Oh, god. Is Wednesday a safe bet? I want to forget this day. All right, sweetie. Thanks for the lift. What's this? Just a little something. Thanks. Mr. Edwards? Molly Mcgrath. Not so good. Actually, I wanted to tell you that, I don't think that I'm... That's not fair. That it's not fair that I should be so lucky. I just wanted to say thanks again for picking me. Okay. See you tomorrow. God, I even quit when I'm trying to quit. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20! All right. What are you guys doing here? You said there was a scrimmage today. so take the field. Yeah, let's go, man! All right, my guys, let's huddle up. I can break his damn face. Don't do that, man. Let him play. Stay in strong, right. Remember our first wrinkle, Peanut? I think so. What are they doing? Kissing her ass, most likely. All right, come, let's fire them up. Let's go fellahs. Watch this. Break! Watch this. Hut! Look at Peanut, that twerp! Yeah, sure! That shit's pretty good. Let's show them what football's all about. Yeah go on. kill them. Marvel, go deep. Phillips, run a post. Let's take care of them. On you, ready? Blue, 22. Fuck you! Come on, come on. Stop those wimps! I'm getting tired of this shit, man. I'm going in! You going in? Yeah. Okay, what are we going to run now? Yo, double reverse. I'll take it. Why don't you just play quarterback Trumaine? I ain't seen you do no end-zone dancing Marvel. Hey, come on. Somebody think of a good play. Let's go. Just run anything, but just stay out of my way. All right. Left formation, double reverse on bean. Okay, and try not to get me sacked this time, bumblehead. Ready. Let's break! Now that's on the chicken shit side, you know? Sorry about that, coach. I was running my blocking assignment. I guess practice is over, Miss Coach? Let's get out of here. Hi, guys. Hi, Jeannie. Nice day at school, Moll? Terrible. Terrible. But I got it all figured out. Yeah? I'm gonna get my old job back at Prescott. And I'll be at the right place at the right time. Remo won't last long with the JV, so, when he bombs out, Molly takes the field. Don't look at me like that. Going back to coaching girls' track is not exactly the same as quitting. Darwell hired somebody else for it today. I'll kill him. The problem with killing him though, is that's the kind of things that goes on your record and it follows you everywhere. Well, I can stick it out. I'll bet she's getting in her Van right now man, tears streaming down her face. She's too stupid to know when to quit. But I hope she stays. Cause I figure I only got a few more days before I get my hands on that quit. You're full of shit, Trumaine. What's the problem, man? Look, she knows I got 10 pounds of dangling fury just waiting for her. I know she wants it. I can tell by the way she looks at me. Put your pants on and listen up! Hey baby, we were just talking about you. Don't call me baby. What did he say? He says, yes, ma'am. My name is Coach Mcgrath. And if that's just too much for you to remember, then just call me coach. Hey, coach? Yes. Why don't you quit, so we can get us a real coach? Amen. You don't get it. I'm the only one who'll take this job. Well you ain't good enough. You want to get rid of me? You really want to get rid of me? Yeah. Absolutely. Step outside. If I drop before any one of you, you can tell me to go to hell. We sure as hell willl we'll help you pack your bags. But if you quit before I do, then from here on out, I call the shots. Right on. I'll bet you $50 that the coach outruns these boys. She's crazy if she thinks she can beat Trumaine or Cerulo. They're fast. I love it! call me and let me know who won. What, you all leaving? What? I'll see you all at the bank. Round, and round, and round here we go, here we go. hey, it's raining. Let's call it a draw, okay? You quit, you lose. I forgot to tell you! I ran the Boston marathon. Oh, shit. Twice! yes! You owe me a new stopwatch! You pussies! Fuck you! Fuck you, what? Fuck you, Coach Mcgrath. Better! Molly. Frank! I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I heard about the little job change. Would you mind getting out of here? What is that on your eye? Cheap mascara. Now get out of here. Seriously, Molly, we do have to talk. Give me a towel. I'm not offended by nudity. Give me a towel. A big towel, Frank. So how are you doing in school? Fine. Good, great. Listen, I think it's terrific you care so much about this coaching job, and I think it's great that those kids are gonna benefit from your experience and expertise. You called, I wasn't home, the school's in the ghetto, and your mind started thinking of all the terrible things that could happen to me, thereby causing you inconvenience. So, you're here to tell me that you don't like me coaching at Central. I hate you coaching at Central. Tough. Excuse me”? What did you just say? I said, tough. So, school is fine, right? uh huh. Yeah. That's terrific, that's just great. You don't care about my opinion? For the 10 years that we were married, your opinion was my opinion! And for the four years that we were divorced, your opinion was still my opinion. that is not true. And now I want my opinion to be my opinion! You don't even know what you're saying. I always gave you your own way. What? That's right. You wanted a Van, right? No, I didn't want a Van! Wait a second... You wanted the Van. No, no, you wanted a Van, we got a Van! You made me think I wanted a Van. I didn't want a Van, you wanted a Van! So, are you getting ready for Halloween here? It's only September. Oh, of course. Go out and trade in that great little Valiant for that stupid Van! And now I have a Van and I wish I had a Valiant! That isn't polite. I was just on my way to the kitchen to get some more water. The kitchen is that way. Stephanie? Stephanie. Stephanie, hello. Hello. Where's Frank? He left, oh, he left, well. What are you doing, Stephanie? I was just waiting for you, Frank. Oh, come on, we're late. Let's go. See you, Molly. I'm sorry, sorry. I'm sorry, are you all right? This is last year's schedule. It's gone. Forget it. You guys are better now. Much better. Now, tomorrow's our first game. Forget the past. Concentrate on tomorrow, and don't be nervous tonight. You okay, mommy? I'm fine, sweetie. Thank you. You can sleep in my bed with me if you're scared, mommy. I'm all right, sweetie. Okay. Good night. let's rock! Okay, listen up. Listen up. How can we concentrate if they keep ringing that fucking bell! If they're the Cougars, how come they got a goat? What are we bitching about? We got a dog dressed like a cat. Can we talk about the game for a minute? Okay. Jet, red right. 20-7 reverse. Speak english. Nobody understands that code shit except you. Okay, Marvel, you go ahead, come back. I'll give it to you. You give it to Trumaine. Trumaine, you run up field, okay? On whore. Ready? Break! Black, 24. Black, 24. Your mother's a whore! When we go with the veer, you've got to hand off to the fullback unless the tackle commits to the inside. Now their tackles have been forcing the play. So you've got to read the outside linebacker. If he commits to you, then pitch to Marvel around the end. Now we're four points behind. We can push right past these guys, right? Right, yeah. Now you don't sound very convinced. Come on, don't you guys have any pride? Yeah! Don't you have any guts at all? Yeah! All right, then. Get out there and get tough! Yeah! Get mean! Yeah! These cougars will be nothing but a fur ball when we get done with them! Yeah! Yeah, let's go eat some pussies! Yeah! Red, 26. Red, 26. The cougars are dicks! All right! All right, come on, guys. Good game. Hey Central, y'all still some rookies. Good game, Cerulo. Way to go, Kru. Hey, you guys played a great game! All right, we'll do better next week. Give it up, central, give it up! Nice game. Good game, coach. Aw man, you guys suck! You better watch some more pros play! Hey, mom! So we lost yesterday. The important thing is, you played a good game. Don't blow smoke up our ass. I wouldn't do that. Especially not up yours, Cerulo. You guys have to remember, we've got nine more games before the season's over. So we've got to get more disciplined, work harder and get more organized. Cerulo, cut it out. What's this? I'm gonna put a play up there, and I want you to write it in your books. I want you to memorize it, take it, because you're gonna be tested on it. Cerulo, okay? It ain't me, coach, I'm innocent. You stole the cougars' goat? Edwards. Edwards, his name's Edwards? Principal Edwards. Principal Edwards. Welcome to our locker room. Right. I thought you all played a fairly decent game yesterday. Make that about 200 percent more decent, and we can start having some victory parties around here. Well we're working on it, aren't we boys? Thanks for coming down. Yeah, I got a call from the principal over at Jackson High. It seems they're missing their goat. I don't suppose anybody around here would know anything about that, would they? What did you say, coach? Nah, no my guys wouldn't know anything about that, would we? Good, because if it's not returned today, any person or persons remotely connected with the disappearance of that goat will be summarily expelled. That gets me steamed. Right. I'm sorry I interrupted your meeting. A joke's, a joke. Now you guys are old enough to be responsible for your own actions. I want a volunteer right now on who's gonna take that goat back, okay? Now who's it going to be? Good goat. Good little goat. Stay here, baby. Hi, mom. Hi, baby. What's this? I got hungry, so I fixed myself some dinner. Chocolate chip is not what I call dinner. Where's Alice? I'll fix you dinner in a minute. Hi, Molly. Jeannie! New hairdo? Yeah, do you hate it? Well, I don't hate it, but I think it really looks terrible. Great, no old person has liked it yet. We're going to the library. Good, I'll take you. You don't have to. We got sick of waiting around, so I finally called my mom and she's coming to pick us up. I'm not that late. I can still drive you. Jeannie's mom will take us. I'll take you. First I have to fix you something to eat. I can't believe she didn't say anything about it. She must really hate it. She just doesn't care. I'm going to fix you a nice dinner before you leave. I don't want a nice dinner. That's my mom. Mom, I don't want to eat. I just want to go to the library with Jeannie, okay? I'll take you after you eat. We're going no, you're not. Jeannie, you may go. Alice, you'll stay here and you're gonna eat your dinner. See you tomorrow. You don't even care if I do bad at school. It's all your fault you came home late and we didn't have any supper. And all you care about are those stupid boys. You don't even care about my hair. You didn't even notice it. I hate you. Alice. Alice, open the door. Okay, I hate your hair. I really, really hate your hair. I didn't want to be one of those mothers who doesn't understand. But I didn't. So I guess I am. What? I wanted to be able to talk calmly about your hair. Marian, come here, honey. You are the most important people in my life. Much more important than any football team. Well if we're so important, then how come you play with them instead of making us dinner? I was late because I had to do the shopping. I am now a football coach and I want to be the best one I can possibly be, just like I want you girls to be the best you can be at whatever you decide to do. I want to be a helicopter pilot. Don't be stupid, Marian, you can't be a helicopter pilot. Of course she can. She can be anything she wants to be, as long as she works hard enough at it. So can you. So can I. Daddy says you're going to quit. He did, huh? Well, he's wrong. I'm not going to quit. I'm going to see this through, but I need you to help me. Can you do that? Okay. Alice? Okay, sweetie. Principal Edwards. Coach Mcgrath. The goat showed up at Jackson High. Must have been catting around, I guess. I thought you'd be pleased to hear it. You don't look pleased to hear it. Krushinski was telling me about last year's quarterback, Lavender Williams. Levander. Levander, yes, the accent"s on the second syllable. You know him? Yeah, we have this kind of hate, hate relationship. You didn't show me his stats. I'd like to see them. Well I figured no sense in having your mouth water for food you're never get your fork into. Are you saying you don't think I can get him to play for me? I think that's what he's saying, coach. Right. Well I'd like to see his stats anyway. Just for the heck of it. Okay, I'll dig them out for you. Let's see here. Say, Krushinski, are you stepping down as quarterback? Well it's, I don't know, it's like I can run good and I can throw good. I just can't... run and throw good. I'm thinking I want the team to win. Right. Wow. I told you he was good. He's also a criminal and chronically truant. I didn't know he was sick. What class would he be in about now? About now, he'd be in 11-a english. However, I seriously doubt if he's in 11-a english. Could I have his address? You don't want to go there. Is Levander Williams here? No. Where is he? At Maurice's. Where's Maurice's? Ouch! Yeah, he's here a lot. He's one of my suppliers. But he ain't here now. Say, lady, is that your Van outside? You ought to consider stepping up to some genuine wire-wheeled hubcaps. No, thanks. I don't care for any... I was wondering if you know where Levander Williams is? These beauties would cost you $400 anywhere else in town. But since you're a friend of Levander's, they're yours, installed, $80. If you could just tell me where I might be able to find Levander. $65. That's below wholesale, lady. I didn't mean to interrupt. Please, just continue doing what you were doing. I was told that I would find a Levander Williams here. I'm Levander Williams. No, no, no, no, I'm Levander Williams. What? All right. All kidding aside, I really need to find Levander. He's about 18... I can show you about 18. Ain't no thing, let's go. Bird. Oh man, what are you doing in here, lady? You're levander, aren't you? I got an appointment to get to. Wait a minute. Bird, wait, I have to talk to you. Bird, I've been chasing after you for two hours. At least give me five minutes. My playing days are over, lady. Hey man, what's up, man? Three minutes. No. I really need to talk to you. Bird, step into my office. Let me handle this. Look here, our car won't start. We were wondering if you could give us a ride. To my mother's house. You and Levander can chat on the way. All right. Nice hubcaps. How much did you pay for them? $65. You was robbed. Look, I ain't got time for football. You know, I'm working on another career. Take the next right. Look, if you're as good as your stats say they are, then we could have a season that attract college scouts. That could mean a scholarship. Yeah, over here man. Is this where his mother lives? Yeah, she got sick of the suburbs. Now listen, we play Dearborn next week. I know I can beat them, all I need is a passer. Give me the keys. Come on! Shit! He said that key would work. Did you see me try it? Did you see the door open? You can't trust what Jimmy say. He's a criminal. I got sick of losing every week. Yeah, but last year you didn't have a decent coach. This year, you've got me, and I'm good! Hey, yoo hoo! Excuse me, what are you doing? The key my mother gave me, it doesn't work. So we've got to go through a window. Yeah, well wait a minute. Listen, he can't walk around on my Van. He's going to cave it in. Listen, can you wait till your mother comes home? No, no, see his mother's in the hospital and needs to have her own nightgown or else she won't let them operate. It's her lucky nightgown. I can't let him walk on my Van. He's too heavy. I'm not playing football, so we have something in common. Look, if you get down, I'll get up, okay? That's fresh! That's cool, man. Not cool. What? Get her down man. We'll come back and do this later. No, we do this now, Bird. It'll take just a minute. I said we'll come back later. Without her. Oh, my god! Come on, man, come on, let's go! Hey lady, you better come on down, lady. Hold on a second, man. Drop. I can't! Lady, come on. I'll catch you damn it. Now, drop! Oh, my god, what's happening? Bird, I'm in a trash can! Be quiet. You want me to be quiet? I'll tell you what. You get my Van back. No problem, now, shut up. And you get back what I paid for those hubcaps. Look, I'll talk to Maurice. Now shut up, be quiet. And you play for Central or I start screaming. Now, lady, look, that place belonged to the biggest fence in town. And the stuff was all stolen. I was just gonna return it to the rightful owners. We're in here! Are you crazy? Shut up. If you play football, my lips are sealed. You know what this is, don't you? This is extortion. That's an ugly charge, Bird. True, but ugly. Right! Left! Right! Left!! That's the bird. I didn't think he'd play this year. Shake that ass! I'm here. Line up. It's like this. I said you guys are so pitiful that I said, Bird, you gotta stop these losers from embarrassing themselves all over town. Street life treating you well? What's the matter, Bird? Don't crime don't pay no anymore? So that's it, huh? I guess I ain't the quarterback no more, huh? I guess not. Did I ever tell you what a good slotback I am? You're hired. Thanks, Kru. way to push through! You're right, Kru! You are a great slotback! All right, last chance. Rocket, slot left, a-back post. Got get them! Thank you very much, it was a great game. Victory parties sure beat the hell out of defeat parties, don't they? Yeah, I'm gonna go get something to drink, when I come back, you better not be flirting with anyone. You hear me? Don't case my house, okay? Are you suggesting that I'm a criminal? You girls did a great job. That mascot costume you made for your dog is a bad motherfucker. Thanks. Thank you. Hi, guys, listen, where are your knapsacks? Come on, go get them. Your daddy will be here in a minute. Let's go. Hey, no drinking! Hand it over. Hand it over Cerulo. Coach, it's nonalcoholic. It's plenty alcoholic. I'll take that, coach. No, you won't. Sorry, homeboy. This here is a private party. Excuse me. Is Molly here? Oh, you mean coach? She's right over there. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, what's your name and favorite sexual position, sweet thing? Frank? It's nonalcoholic. I don't want to hear about it. Frank, Frank? Molly! What's going on here? Don't be grabbing the coach like that! It's a victory party, Frank. We won against Dearborn. That's great! Is this how you celebrate, drinking beer with your players? I wasn't drinking the beer. They were. I mean, I was taking it away from them. Fine. I hope this comes out. You know how ultrasuede stains. Daddy, daddy! Hi, sweetheart. Daddy, Peanut gave us drinks, and said President Muffley's costume was a bad motherfucker. Well, it was. 'Bye, mom, see you Sunday. Oh, my god! What the hell's the matter with you Molly? I leave her here five days and you let her turn into a Martian! You didn't think I'd find you? Hey, hey let go of her! What are you doing, man? What happened? Sweetie, are you all right? Frank, her nose is bleeding. Sweetheart, are you okay? You better just stay back, all of you! Everybody just stop, okay? Anybody who mess with me or my kids, they get hurt. Hey, what's going on? Frank, Frank, what are you doing? You can't come into my house and start slugging people! Are you all right? The party must be winding down. I'm sorry. I thought you were one of them. I am. Come on, sweetie. It'll be okay, sweetheart. Are you okay, honey? We can get an ice pack. Yeah. Is my hair okay? Everything was fine until you got here Frank. That is a matter of opinion, Molly. Now I admit I may have been remiss about spending time with my little girls, but I cannot be remiss about this. What's that supposed to mean? You'll see. Well his lawyer seems to have said it pretty succinctly. My job is endangering the safety and welfare of the children? That's unbelievable. This is just one of those threatening letters lawyers like to write. Don't get too upset about it. Boy, would your dad have been proud to see you now. This is the game ball from the last game he and I played together. Walt, could we not talk about football? Does Frank have a chance of getting custody? I seriously doubt it. Even if they wanna play rough and go to court, it wouldn't happen for months. Don't worry, everything's going to be fine. You just keep doing what you've been doing. I understand you've won three football games in a row. I can't lose my girls, Walt. Let me worry about that. You worry about winning football games. You can serve anytime you're ready Moll. I'm sorry. Four o'clock, my court. Oh Molly. Didn't know it was you. Anyway, your time's up. Mr. Warmth. I hear your Central boys won their last game. Congratulations. My Central boys won their last three games, thanks. Yeah, well you haven't played any decent teams. Wait till you go up against McKinley and Lincoln. Wait till we go up against Prescott. Too bad you're not on our schedule. Assuming you make the all-city championship, that is. That was good, Moll. Just remember, you can't win a pissing contest from a prick. You know something? This whole thing about letting you coach, it wasn't serious. It was like a prank. Now I'm sorry I had anything to do with it cause you're too thick-headed to realize you're making high-school sports in this town look stupid. So you won a few games. You're a laughingstock. You're the joke of Chicago and you don't even know it. They say we're a laughingstock. What? They say we're the joke of Chicago. Don't get mad, get even! Yeah! I thought you said our deal was for five? No, sir. Six dollars will get you an english paper. Science papers got diagrams. I got to charge eight. Hey look, I'll tell you what. Make it seven and I let you cut in front of me at lunch, alright? 7.50, and I get your dessert? Deal. Williams. Eight dollars. Get out of here with that. Give me this man. What is it, history? How about a nice watch? What's your momma want, a crock-pot? Cash. How about a nice answering machine? Remote? Compact-disc player? How do you do? I'm Phillip Finch. What are you doing, Phillip Finch? Just helping your young men satisfy their academic requirements. Take a walk, Finch. Walking. all right, we've got ten seconds to go. Now get Trumaine in a man-to-man. Go jet, slot right, 84 post. All right, let's go, go get them! Hut! All right, Cerulo, you're a genius! Mr. Ruff, thank you very much. You really gave us a run for our money. You're a miracle worker. You did it! We're in the play-offs! In the play-offs! The play-offs! You did it, coach. We're number one! Two? You are definitely off the opera circuit for at least a week. Sure that's all you want? How about some tapioca pudding? Anyway, first, thanks for meeting me here. I know we can talk this thing out. All this stuff with lawyers, and letters going back and forth, I mean who wants it? I acted rashly. I'm a big boy, I can admit it. But you can't blame me, can you? Let's not argue, okay? I didn't come here to argue. I came to make peace through a little plan that I've worked out. Moll, I believe really Chatham will provide the kind of stability that our girls need right now. Stephanie went there, and I think you'll agree she turned out pretty well. It's a little on the conservative side but it's very forward-thinking, too. You're going to love it. Every year there's a Greek pageant where the girls, they wear togas, and they read from the works of Plato, and Aristotle, and Socrates. It's very exciting. What was that you said dear? She just yawned, Mrs. Chatham. She has laryngitis. One of my favorites. I love Heraclitus. Why, of course we can get you something to eat. Did Frank tell you about the rather daring experiment we're going to try in our physical education program? No, I really haven't gotten to that part yet. jazzercise. You know, dancing and prancing to jazz? You can even pick out your own jazz selections. Within reason, of course. You see Molly, the only way the girls could go to school here is if you took over the physical education program. What? I know how busy you've been, so I took the burden of finding a job for you. I know the guys on your team are gonna be upset, but blame it on me. I've got broad shoulders. You motherfucker! What did she say? she said she'd think about it. Hey, Angelique. Come on Johnny, you're gonna make me late here. You want me to put a Cerulo mark on your locker? Do what to my locker? He puts dents in lockers with his head. It's his most intelligent activity. Shut up, Finch. So how about it? Mucho dents on Bobby's locker. I wouldn't do it if I were you, Cerulo. Well I would. Watch this, watch this. Gym lockers are at least nine inches longer than these. So? That results in a lower coefficient of rigidity. What the hell are you talking about? you will fail to make a dent and you'll probably get a concussion. five bucks. You, as they say, are on. Let's go. Cerulo, I got five bucks on you. He's all right, you okay man. He's all right. He's going down. No dent, I win. Finch, what are you doing? What happened to Cerulo? He tried to beat the laws of physics and lost. Get the nurse. God, you'd better be all right. Yeah, he owes me $5. And you owe me one player. That must be what they mean by letting it all hang out! How did your folks let you get like this? Are you kidding? He probably ate his folks. Hey coach, coach, you can't be serious about letting him play. If we lose this game, we're out of the championships. At last, the voice of reason. No offense, guys, but we need some size on the line and Finch does have size. No way I'm going to play, unless a suitable fee can be negotiated before game time. Finch, you are partly responsible for what happened to Cerulo. You're going to play, or I'm gonna have you suspended for gambling. How about a small fee? Come on, let's get ourselves into the championship guys! Let's go! Hello, there. Hey, don't mind me. hut! It's all yours. call time-out! Bird! Time-out, let's go! Time-out! Damn it, Finch. Coach wants you to the sideline, man. You go on, I'll wait here. Coach, Finch is playing like the other team's paying his fee. Trip him, next play, trip his fat capitalist ass. Now, tell Peanut, go on. Okay guys, listen up, listen. Listen up. We're going to go red right, snake motion, quarterback draw. On two, on two. Ready? Break! How are you enjoying the game thus far? hut! Way to go, Finch! Walt, I'm flattered you came to see high school ball. I wish I could say I came for the game. What's wrong? Well Frank got a little hot about that Chatham school thing. He's wangled a hearing. Oh my god, Walt, you said that... Don't get yourself all upset. Don't get upset? That means I have to go to court now? Yes, unless you feel like changing your mind about taking that job at Chatham. You know Ben, the all-city league has a rule that players have to maintain a c average for eligibility? Yeah. I have information from a reliable source that these Central players are ineligible. Yeah? Dan, you've opened my eyes to a very serious problem. I have to punch these young men's grades up on the computer. And we should be getting our computers in say, two years? I guess I'm wasting my time. I'd heard you were a stickler for the rules, like me. Frankly I don't give a shit whether your team's legal or not, 'cause my boys are gonna ream your ass next week. I just thought you'd like to take action as a matter of principle. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? That jacket. That's a beautiful jacket, but you know there's something missing. What? An ID badge. As you know, nobody's allowed here without an ID badge. And since you don't have one, I guess that means that you are not here. Cause if you were here, I'd have to have you arrested. I am a stickler for the rules. You really think you can get away with treating me like this? Right. Frank has no case. The girls aren't in any danger. I mean, what's he going to say? I don't like my ex-wife teaching in the ghetto? Walt says that every time you go to court, you take a risk. Hey. I can't risk losing my girls. Then give up. Quit your job here and teach at Chatham. You're right on course, coach. Straight ahead. You think I should? I think you've already made up your mind to quit. The thing is, if you have, then tell them now. Good game today, coach. Because if you don't, they'll see it in your face. We gather tonight to celebrate the impending and inevitable, All-City Championship. Which will be won by Prescott High School. Just a second. This isn't, this isn't school spirit I'm hearing, is it? If this is school spirit, I must be in the wrong place. I thought I was at Central, I'm sorry. I must be dreaming. But I'll take full credit for this change, because it was I, I alone, with no help from anyone else, who hired Coach Molly Mcgrath. Whose team, I might hasten to add, will be wearing new uniform jerseys, thanks to those of you who finally bought the last of the peanut brittle. What do you say we get her up here, huh? Make a path for Coach Mcgrath! Make a path for Coach Mcgrath, make a path for Coach Mcgrath! I feel so lucky to have been able to coach such a fine football team. Yeah, well you didn't say that when school first opened. Well, we got off to a slow start because... Because we're a bunch of fuck-ups! Well we're having a great season this year. And next year, we go undefeated. Right, coach? Let's take one season at a time, okay? Um, I. You're a great bunch of guys. So thanks, and... Hey wait a minute, you haven't talked long enough. Bird, don't give me a hard time, okay? No, no, coach, look, I'm serious. According to this watch, you've only talked one minute, 32 and 15100s of a second. Here, look for yourself. Why did you take it out of the box for? What a hotdog. What is it? It's a new car. What's it look like? Read the back. Coach. We owe you. Love from your pussies. Speech, speech, speech! I don't know what else to say. Except I want to see every one of you on that field next week while we're playing against Prescott. Cause we're going to kick some ass! Hey little one, what's happening here? I'm fine. I'm just a little wasted on punch. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah. No. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. And you know. Yes, I am fine. If your mother sees you like this she's gonna turn your ass the same color as your hair. We better take her home. Yeah. Time for you to go. Did you ask your uncle before you took his car? He lets me drive it any time I want. Then why did you have to hot-wire it? Have you seen Alice? She was around somewhere. Coach, how about a ride? I have to find Alice. Somebody said Trumaine took her to your house. Trumaine? Vernal I don't want to got to bed. It's not my bedtime. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mom usually lets me stay up till one, or two, or three. She'll be all right. We'll hang around until coach gets here, okay? Hello, Stephanie, you stick, get my dad on the phone. I want to tell him what I think about Chatham. Frank, slow down. Honey, you are going to get a ticket and you're going to ruin your perfect driving record. Do you know state law requires seat belts in the front and rear? Shut up, Finch. Yeah, honey! Oh, shit! Every time I... Frank, what are you doing here? well I think one of us should be here when our daughter is drunk out of her mind and alone. Don't you? Easy Frank, things aren't always as bad as they seem. And then again, sometimes they're even worse. How are you all doing? What the hell is going on here Molly? Trumaine, what is going on? Well Alice needed a ride home and we took her. We were just watching TV till you guys got back. She's upstairs, sleeping. Honey? Hey homegirl, what's happening? This won't be happening at Chatham, I can promise you that. You just try to send me to Chatham, and I'll dye my whole face purple. That's it, Molly, I'm not putting up with this anymore. Outside, Frank. I've got it under control. Just let me handle it. That is the joke of the year. Alice is passed out drunk, you are out partying, and these two are screwing on your sofa. We were not! Not when you came in, we weren't. Trumaine and Marva, why don't you go on home now? Thanks for bringing Alice back okay? You're sure? Yeah, take off. Molly, I'm getting custody of the girls. You don't have to drive me home, coach. You have obviously lost your grip on reality. You can pay for a cab. You can't, no you won't see that you've lost control of what goes on in your own house! 20 bucks should do it, well maybe 15. Finch! You've got guts galore threatening me with losing custody Frank. I was the one who took care of Marian when she had the croup. I was the one who comforted Alice when she woke up in the middle of the night with nightmares for six months after you left! I was the one who blew up a house full of balloons for your daughter's fourth birthday, which you couldn't even find the time to show up at. So don't tell me that I've lost my grip on reality! I can't lose my grip on reality. I'm submerged up to here in reality! Would you just stop being so dramatic for god sake? If I didn't think you'd use it against me, I'd punch your face in. I'd do it for ten bucks. You just keep your fat ass out of this. Frank! No charge. Mommy, I can feel the rotation of the earth. You're plastered, Alice. Just get this over with as quickly as possible. Walt, shouldn't we be whispering, too? Shouldn't we be doing something? We're on our own ten-yard line. We may have to punt, Molly. Don't use football analogies now Walt. Talk like a lawyer, okay? The most serious allegations are that your older daughter Alice was injured in a fight, which occurred during a party held at your home on the night of September 30. And that minors were seen there drinking beer, and that your older daughter became intoxicated, at another party attended by you and was then driven home by a couple whom your ex-husband saw having intercourse in your living room. God, the way they make it sound, I'd rule against me. The opera isn't over until the fat lady sings Molly. What does that mean? Would Miss Mcgrath care to make a statement before I rule on this petition? She would, your honor. Just drive straight up the middle. Your honor, Alice and Marian are my kids and are more valuable to me than anything. I love them very much. Your love for your children is not at issue here Ms. Mcgrath. This is a hearing to determine what is best for the welfare of the children. But he says I'm not the best for my own children and he's wrong. Mr. Needham merely claims that Miss Mcgrath's job as a football coach at Central High is jeopardizing the safety and well-being of his daughters. That's not true. Further, he even tried to reach a compromise. He arranged for a job for Miss Mcgrath at a very fine school which their daughters would attend. An offer she rejected with a profanity, which I would not care to repeat in open court. Now, wait just a second. He tried to trick me into quitting the one thing that I took pride in doing. In order to teach jazzercise to a bunch of over privileged girls. So I called him a motherfucker. Which is linguistically correct, because I'm a mother and used to. Your honor, I'd like to have my client break her testimony at this time, and introduce into the record some character witness testimony. If it's relevant, I will hear the witness. What are you doing? Look alive, look alive. Who's this? It's the football team. Are you all character witnesses? We promise to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and that's no lie your honor. Amen. See, your honor, we're the, if it please the court, I think it's wrong to take Marian and Alice away from coach. Hell, I wish I had a mother half as good as her. You wish you had a mother. This is serious. Cerulo, chill. May I approach the bench? Yes. The point is, Coach Mcgrath cost me a lot of money, because ever since I've been playing football for her, I've been totally straight you know. She told us if we fu... if we fouled up, that we were off the team. Pardon me mama, now look. Any woman good-looking as yourself shouldn't be wasting her time. I'll bet, easy, pops. Why don't you wait your turn, okay? Now I'll bet me and you can work this whole thing out. Don't you got like a chamber around here, something like that where we can go and... Mr. Coes, I'm sorry, I Don not see where this testimony is relevant. It's relevant right fucking here, that's where it's relevant. Goddamn it, asshole. Order, order! You suckers think you're bad? Keep it up, and I will hold you in contempt of court! Now, sit down, turkeys! See what you did, man? Your honor, if Miss Mcgrath persists in retaining her associating with this team, then petitioner must request not only that custody be immediately granted to Mr. Needham, but that she forfeit any visitation privileges during the football season, and that the children be enjoined from attending games, or otherwise associating with team members at any time during the year. Further... Wait, wait, stop. All right, Frank, you win. Next semester, I quit coaching and I teach at Chatham. Now call this thing off, okay? Take it, quick. You're off side, you jumped out of bounds. Shut up. I can't risk losing my girls. Your Honor, plaintiff accepts respondent's offer. Ms. Mcgrath, are you sure this is what you want? Yes. May I leave now? This hearing is closed. Not too shabby, huh? Yeah. Congratulations. You did a wonderful job. Thank you very, very much. Molly, I'll bring the girls to the game. Okay? Miss Mcgrath, good luck tomorrow. Thanks. Damn. Knock this dick in the dirt! Coach Cooze and her Velvet Pussies. I'm a funny guy! Yeah! I can't hear you! Go for his nuts! You're all right son, get up, you got 20 minutes to shake it off. Peanut? That's what happens, it's a rough game. The kids get hurt 'cause they're trained for girl's track, not football. Yo, like why don't you eat shit and die? Are you all right, Peanut? As long as I don't have to get up, ever. Shit. All right, we're two tds behind. We can get them back. Bird, three times Trumaine was wide open. Yeah, yeah, right, I couldn't see from the bottom of the pile I was under. You trying to say something about my blocking man? Is that what you call it? Shut up before I rag your face. Hey look, it's nobody's fault. They're champions, and we're a bunch of Dildos. Oh that's nice. So what do you want to do? You wanna quit? Why not? It worked for you. What's that supposed to mean? I sent plays in, you just didn't execute. I see, this is about yesterday. Great. I suppose you think I was chicken shit for what I did in court, huh? I suppose you think I got beat because I was afraid to fight. Yeah, you do. And you figure if your coach is such a loser, then that gives you all the right to be a bunch of losers, too, doesn't it? Doesn't it! Hey coach! Coach, where you going? Frank! The deal's off. You're not sending our girls to some school they don't wanna go to and you're not taking them away from me! Word up! And I'm not quitting my job here either. Yeah, and if that's not okay with you, then you can sue me, and I'll fight you all the way to the supreme court. Don't make her give up the kids, Frank. Let her have the kids, you worm. Stay out of this! Frank. I don't want to be a quitter anymore. I don't want our girls to see a quitter. For them, not for me. Okay. We'll work it out. We'll work it out? We'll work it out. Yeah. They're gonna work it out. That's great. One more condition. Second half, you got to cheer. Oh, god. Supreme Court, Frank! I'll cheer, I'll cheer. Maybe you'd like to take them for the second half. You bet, come on, bench warmers, let's go! Hey lady, you our coach or what? Yeah, I'm still your coach. Well then tell us what to do. Win, you Turkeys! Hut! You play like an old woman! You guys are pitiful! You're morons! Now come on, turn it out. All right, let's go! Line up, line up fast! Set! Get a hit! This is getting to be a really good game. Okay, all right! Great, guys! I love you. All right, it's up to you Alonzo, you make this point, and every girl in the free world will want you. Come on, turn it out! Use those cleats! Maim them! I hate football, hate it! Hut! Damn! No problem. Hut! Get him! All right, all right, you did it! Way to go Central, all right, all right! You know you don't really have to cheer. It wasn't a court order. This is a great game. Hut! Block for the guy, will you block for the guy? Oh Christ. Excuse me, coach. Get this guy out of here. That's okay. See, I'm not with them. I won't play unless they pay me. Pay you? That's right. Consider me neutral. Get rid of this guy, will you? You want some advice? Nice one. You're being humiliated out there and I think you should give up. Get out of my face, you fat fuck! Come on, girls, come on! Cover two, Peanut! I want to play, coach. What? I want to play. Not now, Finch. Put a hat on, somebody! I want to play. Yeah, all right! Watch the screen! Hey Dawson, slide down! Here's ten bucks, put me in. - Dan, take a look. - What? - Mcgrath. - What's the matter? Let's go! $15 Finch, put your money away! Defense, defense! Come on, Walt! They got less than a minute. If they kick a field goal, Prescott's ahead 24 to 21, all the yelling's not going to help. Time, time, time! You miss this kick, you'll be running laps for life. Now, move boy, move, move, move. It's not over till the gun sounds! Right on! Defense, defense! Defense, defense! Finch. Finch? Finch! All right, now get your body between the ball and the goal post. All right, go on. Go. What are you doing? I'm getting the 15 bucks I owe you. Oh Finch, get out there! She's gonna put that fat guy in. I love my guys. Beautiful, a finely-trained killing machine, a thing of beauty. Hut! All right. People, that fat guy got paid! Good game, good game. No way, this is not over, not over! Calm down man, calm down. Good game, Dan. This isn't over. She paid him! Are you crazy? He's probably got the money on him right now. Search him, search his pockets! Excuse me sir, it's football uniform, it doesn't have pockets. His jock, it's in his jock! Oh, my god. Search his jock! I'm not searching his jock. Search his jock! I'm not searching his jock. Then you're off the team. I'm a senior, no problem. I'll do it myself! Oh Dan! If you're gonna search his jock, I really would rather you'd shake my hand first. I know it's in here somewhere! I saw it go in! Let me down, you pea-brained son of a bitch! Finch, put him down. Not until he shakes your hand like a gentleman. I'll never shake her hand! If he doesn't want to shake my hand, then he doesn't have to. It's okay. Do you wish to be a hand shaker or a shot put? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Thanks, Dan. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, Finch, you can put him down now. No, no, no dont let me down! Shit! Hey come on, coach, it's party time. We gonna get down tonight! Not at my house!
