'And not too heavy on the lips. Dorothy's shine by themselves.' 'Make sure the kicker hits it just over her left shoulder.' [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Dorothy.. That was Wanda Sue.. - She just had an accident. - What?! Is she ok? Yeah, she's a little shaken. The car is wrecked. And she won't be able to get here tonight. 'I was wondering if you had any plans?' Well, I wouldn't ask, but my wife is ill. - And, uh.. - I know.. 'I really don't like to leave her home alone.' I'll call my aunt and see. - Would you? - Yeah, sure. [phone ringing] Hello. - Hi, Aunt Hilda, it's me. - Oh, hi, Dorothy. 'Hey, listen, Wanda Sue had this accident, but she's okay.' 'But, Max's wife is ill and I feel I should stay on tonight.' Joanna's going to be real disappointed. 'You know how much we've been looking forward to tonight.' Oh, I know. But I feel I should do this. You know how good he's been to us. Alright, Dorothy. Max doesn't know how lucky he is. Thank you and give Joanna a kiss. I'll talk to you later. - 'Bye.' - Okay, bye. That's two chocolates and a strawberry. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you, Dorothy. - You're welcome.

[disco music] (Lomax) 'I want you to know that you're a big disappointment.' Mr. Lomax.. ...you gotta believe me. I never gave the cops nothing. We let you run a couple of girls and hustle a little dope. And what do you do for us? - You snitch. - 'I never snitched.' I thought maybe you had a little something. Like you could maybe handle a few things for me. But you ain't got it. 'You're a loser.' Mr. Lomax, I swear to you. I never gave 'em nothin'. Capoy saw you with Royce. - Spilling your guts to him. - No way! I don't go near him. - You lie. - No, Honest. It don't fit you good. - I'm telling you, Mr. Lomax-- - You'd do it again. You sleep with the fish. [disco music] Turn the radio off. - What'd he say? - Nothing. Well, what did Lomax want? Wanted to wish me a happy birthday. [laughing] Hey, no kidding. Today's your birthday, huh. - Yeah, Pooch. - Happy birthday. [engine revving] Uh, let me speak to Sergeant Royce. This is Snider, Royce. What the hell is going on? Don't give me that. I just left the man. What happened to the protection you promised me? Thanks a lot, cop. Hi.. Hey. What would you like? A pretty girl like you should never ask that. Ah, let me have a chocolate cone please. You want something, Pooch? Naa.. That'll be 55. - Is that a hundred? - Uh hmm.. What are you going to say? Never saw one before? Course I have. Just not up close. I can't change it, anything smaller? No, I only carry hundreds. Honest. Tell you what, I got an idea..

You like 'em a little young, huh? - Some of the time. - How about dinner, Saturday? I'll think about it. (Dorothy) 'How was the ice show?' Hey, hey, hey. That girl in there had some kind of body. - That she did. - How'd you make out? - She's going out with you? - She will. That child is gonna make me a whole lot of money, Poochy. When is he gonna be here? 'Sit down, Joanna.' It's him. - Hi. - HI. - This is Joanna. - 'How you doin', Joanna?' - Say hi to Paul. - Hello. - Those for me? - Nope. - This is Paul Snider. - Hi, mum. - Thank you. - You're welcome.

Yeah, how do you like the view? It's delicious. Tomorrow, I'm gonna make you pasta. And Monday, chicken which will make your stomach say thank you to your mouth. - I can't see you every day. - Why not? - Because.. - Aahh, Mr. Camaro. No, he's just a boy I see once in awhile. 'Correction, used to see once in awhile.' Okay. Okay. [laughing] Would you like to dance? This way. Would you do me a favor? Take your heels off. I already did. - Napoleon was only 5'2". - Oh, yeah.. Yeah, let's boogie, Josephine. [instrumental music] [slow music] It's just like the movies. You like it? - It's real special. - So are you. - I'm not. - Wait a minute, wait a minute Let's get something straight, Miss Stratten. You're the most beautiful girl I ever saw. You don't have to say that. I want to. I want to shout it out to the world. Hey, Vancouver, I got the most beautiful-- You're going to wake up everybody. I don't care. I want to. That's the way I feel about you. I know it's only been one night. But I'm nuts about you. It's no jive. [instrumental music] That was some kiss, mister. What time is it? - 12:10 - I got to go. - What's the rush? - I got to get home. You sure? Tomorrow, pasta. Monday, chicken. [instrumental music] (Joanna) 'What do you see in him.' He's nice. Why? Cause he buys you dresses and diamond rings. Is that it? No. He cares about me. He teaches me things and makes me feel good. I'll bet. Does your mom know you're reading these books? What does he teach you? Lots of stuff, like how to order wine. How to dress and.. ...how to talk. He talked okay before you met him. Just leave me alone? What was wrong with Floyd or Richie? They were nice boys. That's just it. They were boys. Paul's different. You're telling me. I know it's tough to understand. Paul's a man. And men have a way of knowing what a woman needs. And what she wants. You'll understand when you grow up. If growing up means having to go out with guys like him than I hope I never do. [instrumental music] Well.. [car horn] I'm leaving. I'm not happy about you seeing him Dorothy. Just give him a chance? - You've only met him once. - 'Once was enough.' That guy is after something. And I don't just mean you know what. 'He's a, he's a no good.' 'And believe me, I can spot 'em when I see 'em.' Every man is not my daddy. I'm so sorry. Don't worry, everything will be fine. - See you later, squirt. - Have fun. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hi. What's wrong? What's wrong is you sewed up the front and you're wearing a bra. What's the matter with you? I told you, no bra. What's with the make up? I said virginal. I told you a simple clean and pure and you smear your face with that junk. I'll take it off in the bathroom. The bra too. Okay. [engine revving] [lounge music] Sid.. Hey, my man. How are you Sidney? Sit down please. - You want a drink? - Yeah, club soda. Club soda. Alright let's have a club soda for my mother please. With lime. - Okay, Snider, where is she? - She's in the can. Wait until you see her, Sidney. She'll knock your socks off. Snider, snider, snider. Honey.. Is that right? Sidney Parker meet Dorothy Stratten. - How are you? - Hi. Sit down. Well.. Well, uh.. - She's fantastic. - And this dude knows. He's photographed some of the best looking girls. - How old are you, Dorothy? - Eighteen. When do we shoot? - What? - He's gonna take your picture. - For what? - For Playboy. They got a talent hunt and they're looking for new girls. You're gonna be one of them. - You never told me about this. - 'So what if I never did.' (Sidney) 'Dorothy does the idea of posing bother you?' No. Not really. I don't know if my aunt would like it. Your aunt? What's your aunt got to do with this Who gives a damn! She won't make you a star, I will. If I say pose, you pose. I say stand on your head and you stand. I wanna hear no more about aunt, okay? So, how about tomorrow night? My place 7:30? - Okay. - Okay, terrific. - I'll meet you there. - Go to see you, Sid. I knew it, I knew it, baby. You blew him away. Why didn't you tell me about him? Thought you liked surprises. I do, I.. - All this stars-- - Honey, you'll be famous. May I have the check please? I mean it, Hollywood, TV, Movies. It's all gonna happen. I know, I mean it. I'm a blonde with.. ...with a chest and-- Have you looked in the mirror lately? I took off the make up. I didn't mean it that way. I mean have you noticed that fabulously sexy-- Do not. What're you looking at? - I'm sorry. - Get out of here. Listen to me. I don't believe it, I'm jealous. You must really be getting to me, babe. How about you? Am I getting to you? You definitely have. Well then, we're going to make it. Right up there looking down on everybody. I don't know if I'd like that. You mean driving around in a Rolls Royce. And having lunch at the Pear Lounge. - Where? - The the Pear Lounge It's a place in LA, I've been there. It's tough. A shot and a beer is nine bucks. I don't know. When are you gonna get smart, Dottie? What do you want to do? Keep humping tasty creams. I gotta get you out of here. I gotta get you some bucks. Come on lets go. Hi. I'm sorry. I found this in the backroom. I didn't-- I noticed. There was nobody in the shop. It's alright. Dorothy.. I ran into your Aunt Hilda at the four corners last night. I guess you know she's pretty frantic about you. - You mean about Paul? - Yeah. And I can't say that I blame her. I mean.. She's tried to raise you like.. ...like your mom wanted. These past four years.. I have watched you grow up and out.. ...in every which way. You're a real hard worker. And you're smart. And you care about people. Which is more important than all the rest of it put together. I guess what I'm trying to say is.. ...I'm very fond of you. I don't want to see some greasy little con man trash you over. The world is full of his kind. There aren't very many like you. I'm going to wash the freezer. (Sidney) 'You are so beautiful, so good looking.' Fantastic, okay give me that smile. 'Give me that smile. There we go.' Give me a little shoulder now. Now pout. Give me that lower lip. Give me a pout. That's wonderful. 'Give me the pout. Little more shoulder. Little more.' 'That's great. One more. One more.' Fantastic. Relax, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - 'Boy.' So? - She is top-shelf. - Boy, you're telling me. You, uh, wanna do the nude stuff now? Will she agree to it? 'Course she will. Give me a minute with her. Okay. Oh, Sid's flipped his lid over you, babe. - Yeah? - Yeah. This stuff's gonna be terrific, right? - Yup. - See. - 'I'm glad.' - Yeah, so am I. I knew it would be. You looked so sensational. - You ready? - Yeah, anytime she is. Okay. Uh, he wants to do some looser stuff now. Like what? You know, more relaxed. Without the towel. - You said I wasn't gonna have-- - I know. Sid feels he needs some full figure shots. I'm not posing nude. Why? 'Cause I wouldn't feel right about it. [laughing] You don't have anything to be afraid of. I've seen you. And you're just another naked lady to him. He's shot hundreds of naked ladies. Haven't you, Sid? Yeah, if she doesn't wanna do it though we can send the pictures we've got. Listen to me, Dorothy.. ...this is the launch pad right here. Right now Sid and his camera can put you into orbit. These pictures can be your ticket on a rocket. We gotta show the people out there how beautiful how really terrific you are, do you understand that? Why do you think I'm doing this? - I mean, buying you clothes-- - I don't know. Why are you? Because I believe in you. I know you got what it takes. I wanna see you get it all. And how much do you get? Nothing. I-I don't get nothing. Except to see you on top where you belong. That's what I get. What do you say, babe? Let's go to work, huh? If that's the way you want it. You wanna be some small-time.. - Stop it. - ...fine with me. You believe this? I try to make her into something-- Alright! What? I'll do it. You sure, babe? I don't wanna feel like I'm being used, that's all. Oh, Dorothy, don't you think I understand that? Let's just do this, okay? Is that a centerfold? That is a centerfold. (Dorothy) 'But it's not the pictures.' 'I told you that when you first showed them to me.' I know what's going on in the world. You're a beautiful girl and.. ...and I'm happy they picked you. It's not that, it's him. Why don't you understand he's not going with me? Maybe not now, but he will. If they choose you, he'll be on the first plane there, watch. Why shouldn't he? He's the one that made it happen. Oh, Dorothy, I just can't bear the thought of you two together. Gonna have to. You've gotta stop and take another look at that guy before you do something foolish. I mean it. - He's a criminal. - He's not, that's a lie. It's not, I admit he doesn't have a big record but he has one just the same. and I'm terrified when you're out with him, what he might do. But he loves me. He'd never hurt me. He makes me feel like I'm somebody. But you are somebody. (Hilda) 'You're a sweet, pretty, lovely girl..' ...and you deserve a lot better than him. Sit. What times your plane? 8:00. I don't suppose you need a ride to the airport. [instrumental music] Honey, just promise me you'll think about him real hard. There's nothing more to think about, we're together. 'I know you have trouble understanding him' lots of people do, but I know him. He loves me so much. I don't know why, but he almost worships me. Dorothy, no. You're gonna have to accept him. If you love me, you're gonna have to love Paul too. Never. [tires screeching] (female on PA) 'White zone's for immediate loading' 'and unloading of passenger only.' 'The white zone is for immediate--' Ms. Stratton, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm Reggie. Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. This way, please. Is this your car? No, ma'am. It's your limousine. [chuckles] [instrumental music] Thanks, buddy. - 'This your first time in LA?' - Mm-hmm. My first time on a plane. My first time in a limousine, too. Believe me, it won't be your last. - Does the phone work? - Oh, yeah. Everything works. 'You just sit back and enjoy yourself.' Okay. [music continues] What's the party? - 'Huh?' - All these people. 'Uh, this is nothing. Sundays are always like this.' [music continues] - 'Dorothy.' - Yes? Hi. I'm Mindy Ames. Welcome to the mansion. Thank you. Reggie, will you take those to my room? - Okay. - Thank you, Reggie. (Reggie) 'Okay.' Hef wants to talk later in the library but.. in the meantime, you want to take a swim? I didn't bring a bathing suit. That's okay, I'll lend you one. Come on. Oh, it's so beaut.. Hi. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Who is that? Oh, what's his name? The actor. Oh, I can't remember his last picture. Oh, neither can he, honey. Come on. Alice, hi.

What do you say? Janey was looking for you up at the stairs, okay? Oh, my God. - What? - Oh, my God. Where? What? (Barney) 'Oh, who is that?' 'That Sherm is a girl.' We got to stop coming up here, Barney. Very nice. You see, that's what I mean, understatement. I mean, that's what we need you for because A, you got that laid back thing, you got cool, class and that's what we need in this picture. Sorry, Sherm. Come on, David, look, Davey, Davey.. ...before you pass on it, will you think about it? Look, David, what is your part.. - It's bucks. - No. I'm unavailable, guys. We can give it to you. Can give it all to you. Davey, you want to meet her? Who wouldn't? Who's that? - Where? - Guy over there. 'In the pink.' Oh, that's David Palmer. He's a writer producer. (Mindy) 'Uh-huh. Off limits.' He takes scalps. Little blonde ones. I don't believe that. [instrumental music] [door opens] You like Monet? I'm Hugh Hefner. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. So that is Monet? It's very beautiful. Everything here is. - Mindy get you settled? - Yes. Thank you. I liked those proof sheets you sent me very much. Thanks. That's all I've been doing all day, saying thanks. I mean, everybody's been very nice. Did Mindy explain the schedule to you? She said the magazine wanted to take some more pictures. How long can you stay? As long as I have to. Photo sessions will take a week or two then we have to decide if and how we're going to present you. You can stay on here if you like or we could find you a hotel. - Whatever you think. - No. No. No. What do you want? What do you want? I'd love to stay here. [laughing] Good. I'm sure we can arrange a job for you. - Maybe something at the club. - Oh, great. [phone buzzing] Excuse me. Yes? Yeah, sure. Let him in. Well, I'm sorry. I have another appointment. Oh, of course. I understand. It's nice to have you with us, Dorothy. Mr. Hefner, this is.. ...the most wonderful thing that's ever happened. Hey, it's Hef. And all you have to do is be beautiful for the camera. I'll try. - Bye-bye. - Thank you. Okay, girls, and lots of energy! (male #1) 'That's it. Okay now keep moving.' Right. Great. That's wonderful. Okay, your hair, Vicky. 'That-a-girl.' Do your bow. That's it. Wonderful. Would you move over to the chair? And, Dorothy, come on in. 'Come on into the post.' That's it. Wonderful. The eyes. Let's see them. Okay, nice smile, honey.

(Mindy) 'I told you she's in the middle..' - 'Watch your light.' - 'I don't care, Paul.' That's it. You've got it. Okay. (Mindy) 'Look, buster, don't talk to me like that.' - 'That's it. Great.' - 'Paul!' Okay, not good, alright, let's reload this and let's get the next set. Okay, ladies, you're gonna take 15. (Mindy) 'Hang on!' Dorothy...he's on the phone again. Girls, come in.

Listen, did they say anything more about that playmate of the month thing? Not since we last spoke, but it looks good I think. Oh, terrific. That's terrific. - I called you last night. - 'I was out.' Yeah, I know, with who? A business manager. - 'Really?' - Mm-hmm. 'What did he want?' I think he wants to sign me. Hold it. You don't sign nothin' till I see it first. Nothin'. - Okay, I won't. - Damn well better not. 'I said I wouldn't.' Find us a place yet? No. You mean to say, it takes three months to find a lousy house? - 'Paul, I've been busy.' - Doing what? Doing what? I've been taking pictures. 'Uh, meaning.. You know what I'm doing.' Yeah, you bet I know. - What's that supposed to mean? - 'That means, I've been there.' I've seen the action around there. I know what goes on. 'I'm not sleeping with anybody if that's why you're worried.' I'm not accusing you of anything, Dorothy. - 'Yeah, I know you love me.' - 'Course I do. I know that, I-I just miss my baby doll, that's all. I miss you too. When are you gonna come down? Well, I got a really big deal cooking with Pooch. Soon as we get it nailed, I'll be there. 'You don't know when? Can't give me a day or anything?' Why, you need some kind of warnin'? No, I wanted to pick you up at the airport. 'Yeah, sure. I'll bet.' Listen, Paul, I gotta go, okay? - I don't want you to hang up. - I've gotta go. - I'm holding up the shooting. - 'Don't hang up.' - I'll talk to you later. - 'Dorothy.' I miss you. Bye. [intense music] To Miss August. [crowd cheering] - You want to say something? - What? - Anything. - Come on. Come on. I never expected this to happen so I'm a little nervous, uh.. '...this is really very special.' Well, I just thank you all very much. [laughing] Oh, thank you. I don't know what it is, but she's got something special. World class.. Mm-hmm. So, how's the casting coming? Hmm, not bad. Signed Shirley yesterday morning. Oh. Means you got the leads locked up. Yeah, well.. ...still gotta find a girl to play Amy couple of other people. What about her for Amy? Cute laugh. (David) 'Well, I don't know, can she act?' (Billy) 'Well, she's done a couple of television things.' Walk-ons mostly. Come on, why don't you let her read for it? She your client, huh, Billy? Sure, yeah. (Billy) 'Come on, what do you say?' Okay. Have her come by my office tomorrow afternoon. You got it. That's Paul, Dorothy's boyfriend. - They've met. - Hello. I'd like to talk to you about something. A great project. - Okay. - 'Well, then, tomorrow?' - Okay. - 'Well, Dorothy, that's great.' Why don't you give me a call at my office and.. ...we'll get together. Yeah. Oh, sure. We'll get back to you. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. Champagne? - See you later. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. - Can we get outta here? - 'We can't leave.' - 'Why not?' - What a jerk. 'This is for me, it'd be rude. Okay, but please, soon. This is our night, babe. I don't wanna spend it with jerks. Excuse me, hi. - Can I talk to you? - What do you want? - It doesn't concern you-- - Now, wait a minute. Anything about her concerns me, don't you forget it. Right. - I set up a reading. - Great. With whom? - Call me in the morning. - You're not paying attention. I said, anybody she talks to, talks to me first. Right. You hear what I'm telling you? (Paul) 'You don't run Dorothy Stratton, I do.' She's mine! My property. Listen, you just crawl back into that hole you came out of. Leave her alone. Can we please get out of this dump? - I'm sorry. - You okay? Yeah. Should I get a driver to take you home? No, I should go with him. You sure? Yeah. Thank you for the night. It was wonderful. You take care of yourself. Okay. I'll see you later. [intense music] [music continues] 'What are you so hacked off about?' Talkin' to you. I don't care what those clowns over at the mansion think. Yeah, well, I do. Let's not fight, please. Come on, honey. Tonight's your night. Thanks to you, it's ruined. Well, it's not over yet. That's what you think. What was I supposed to do, Dorothy? Let that hustler start peddling you without going through me? He's just trying to help me, Paul. To do what? I don't believe you. How many times should I tell you I'm not sleeping with anybody? Why can't you understand? Billy is a nice guy and well connected and is helping me out. I'm lucky he's my business manager. He's a crook. He's honest. He's what? He's honest. Everybody tells me so. When are you gonna get hip, girl. This is Shark City. Everyone out there is looking to grab your body or money and in your case both. I think it's in your case both. You just don't wanna believe it. You better start believing it otherwise they'll be picking your bones up off the beach. Thanks for a great evening. I'm talking to you. Where you going? [door slams] (Dorothy) 'That's it, huh?' I go to bed with you or you find another girl? - 'That's it.' - Well, no thanks. (David) 'Maybe you'd like to think it over.' I don't need any job that bad. [door opens and closes] I was terrible. I was really terrible. 'No. You were average.' But not terrible. No. But, not good. Have you studied at all? - Some. - Yeah. Not quite enough I think. I know, you don't have to tell me. What I mean is, that you.. ...you just need a little bit more. I don't know if it'd help. Maybe not, if you want my opinion, it's worth a shot. [door opens] David, I.. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No. No. It's alright. This is Dorothy Stratton. This is Jean Willes. She's my very own Lady Macbeth. Save the jokes for the rewrite. They called? Mr. Good taste and his elves would like you to drop by the studio tomorrow. Dammit. He's come up with the perfect ending. - Don't tell me. - I wouldn't dare. I should've been a plumber. (David) 'What's this? What've we got here?' Gotta sign these for the studio, I'll mail them in the morning. - It's nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you too. I really appreciate you seeing me today. - Do you have to go? - Why? Well, I was sorta hoping you'd do an old man a kind deed. Like what? Like stay, have dinner with me. You're not old. [chuckles] Then I could be your father. But you're not. [laughing] [instrumental music on radio] (Dorothy) 'It's not that.' I have trouble dealing with some of the people in this business sometimes. Such as? I don't know, they always seem to get so wound up. You know like it all consumes them. It's all they ever talk about. All the time. It's like life or death. Well, it is.. ...for some of 'em. That's sad. Anyway, go back to the story. You graduated high school. And then I, uh.. ...I worked in the ice cream place for a while and.. ...then I met Paul. Paul? Oh. Hmm. He was the one at Hef's last night. 'Where does he fit in?' Uh.. ...we were roommates. Oh. Well.. ...he's a lucky guy. Actually, that's not fair. Paul's the one who got me started. And if it hadn't been for him 'I wouldn't be here right now.' I don't know about that. You know you're extremely pretty. 'I think you'd have surfaced somehow.' No...not without him. What does he do? Besides, riding shotgun on you. He's a promoter. 'Mud wrestling and, and car shows.' And wet bikini contests. He should do very well in LA. Actually, he spends most of his time managing me. Managing or manipulating? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. It's none of my business. You're actually not the first person who said it. He doesn't mean to. He really doesn't mean to. It's.. He just cares about me so much. He gets crazy sometimes. I really should be going. I hope we're still friends. Oh. I hope so. Thank you. I'll definitely call her first thing in the morning. She doesn't take many new students. If she tries to broom you, you have her call me. - Okay. - Let me know how you're doing. - You mean it? - Yes. Very much. Okay, I will. Thank you. [knocking on door] Hi. I'm sorry I took so long. No sweat, baby. How did it go? - Good. Great. - Yeah? What do you mean? You got the part? I don't think so. He liked me. He wanted me to join Helga Lawrence's classes. - Is she good? - The best. Then, let's get you into the class, babe. But they are expensive. Who cares? Come here. I got an idea. What? Let's get married. - I say somethin' wrong? - No. 'But the idea doesn't exactly blow you away, huh?' Just wasn't expecting it, Paul. I love you. You love me right? 'So let's do it.' Come on. It'll be a gas. - When? - I don't know when. How about Saturday? - Um, we should call some.. - Call who? I don't know. Um.. Who is he? 'Who is who?' Now, don't jive me, Dottie. You've been playin' around, haven't you? - No. - I knew it. Paul. I have not. Then, marry me. I want you, baby. - I need you. - But you've got me. I know that. I know I have you, but it's not the same, see. I wanna feel like I.. Like you own me? Is that what you think, Dottie? - That's not fair. I'm sorry. - I don't wanna own you, baby. I just wanna love you. 'And hold you.' 'And protect you, that's all.' Okay. Ah, forget it. I don't want no mercy marriage. Come on, Paul. I don't need your charity, lady. I don't need that. I know a hundred broads who'd flip over the idea of being married to me. Make me the hundred and first. You really mean that? We're never gonna be apart, baby. Never, never, never. I'm never gonna let you go. (Dorothy) 'So what you're saying is I shouldn't?' I don't make judgment calls, but I can't say that I'm very thrilled about it because I'm not. For some reason I didn't think you would be. Dorothy, whether you know it or not an awful lot of people around here love you and care about you and want what is best for you. And Paul isn't? You're the only one who can answer that. Hi, sweetie. What's the matter? What's the matter, love? - It's Dorothy. - What's wrong? What happened? She-she married him. Oh, no. This afternoon in Las Vegas. Oh, Dorothy. Why? [Paul laughing] I must not be getting through to you, Compton. This is not some two-bit bimbo you're representing here. This is a high-class item. She's gonna be a star. Do you know what that means? Realize what kind of bucks we're talking about? Of course, I do. That's why I wanted to form that corporation. - And I don't. - Sure because you're not in it. I don't need her money. I got deals. That's right. I got lots of things poppin'. Oh, yeah. So I hear. Oh, how is the wet jockstrap contest coming? - Don't you talk down on me. - Come on, Paul. I don't need you dumpin' on me like that. I don't sit around slicin' 10% off other people's backs. Yeah. Judging by Dorothy's tax returns I'd say you sliced a whole lot more than that. Why shouldn't I? I earned it. - Ah. - 'That's right. Every penny.' Tell him about the two jobs I held so you could go to what's her name's classes. Tell him about the dresses. She didn't even have a dress when I met her. 'I don't mean a good dress. I'm talkin' about just a dress.' - I built this-- - Shut up! I'm so tired of hearing how you made me. What are you saying, I didn't? No. I just wish you'd stop talking about it for once. [intercom buzzing] Yeah. Just a second. Do you mind? Sure. Make yourself right at home. Paul Snider. Yeah, sure I'll accept the charges. Heh-hey, Tony, what's happening? I'm sorry, Dorothy, I don't know what we're gonna do with him. Yesterday he went down to the bank downstairs and he tore that place apart. He wanted to see your canceled checks. He demanded to know what your balance was. He's in there making deals. He's accepting front money and jobs for you without telling me or your agents. Dorothy, somebody is gonna have to put a muzzle on him and soon or we're gonna be in a lot of trouble. I'm so mixed up. I walk around like I'm in a daze all the time, you know. I know, and he's not helping things, ain't he? What do I do about it, Billy? I-I don't know, sweetheart. I...that's up to you. If you want my advice, I'd tell you to shake him and fast. He's just no good. Guess what I just nailed down for you, baby. - What? - Another personal appearance. Two grand plus expenses. - For when? - For next week. - An RV show in Vegas. - Uh-uh. No way. I do not want her doing gigs like that. - She does. - She doesn't. She does because I say so. You wanna a piece of me? - You're damn right. - Stop it! Stop screaming over me like I'm some cow you both owned. I'm so tired of this. I'm tired of being bought and sold and negotiated and nailed down. That's all you ever think about. Both of you. Where are you goin'? I'll see you later. - Hey, don't you do that-- - Hold on, will ya? (Paul) 'I'll see you tomorrow at 2:30.' No, I can't make it 3 o'clock. I got another meeting. Yeah. Alright. Bye-bye. Okay, baby, you can knock it off now. 'Bring your junk back. I'll fix us some pasta.' Give me Muffin. Give me my cat. Paul. 'How do you want it? Dead or alive?' Where do you think you're goin'? I'm going to Mindy's. You said she moved back in with that purpose guy. He's in Mexico doing a picture, Paul. I'm staying there until I find a place. You got a place right here with me. Not anymore. What are you talkin' about? You're not gonna leave me. What's so wrong with me? It's just not right. It was right when I was bustin' my chops tryin' to make you into somethin' though, isn't it? Did you forget about that? - Give me my cat. - Here. Take it. You walk out that door you ain't never getting back through it again, that's it. I'm not jivin' you, Dottie. You're not gonna make a fool out of me. You split, we're over. Done. Finished. - 'Is that what you want?' - I don't know what I want. All I know is that it's not you. Dottie. [screaming] 'Dottie!' [indistinct shouting] You're not leaving me. Dottie, get out of that car. Dottie, get out of that car. Stop the car, Dottie. Stop this car! Will just stop the car and talk to me, Dottie? Come on. Stop it. Dottie! - David. - Hey. - How are things on Venus? - Spacey. - How you been? - Been good. - Saw your picture. - Yeah? I liked it a lot. I liked the girl. I think she was very good. - So what are you up to? - Well, writing another one. Oh, good. The jungle drums say you and your shadow have parted company. Yeah. I'd like to have dinner with you sometime. - I'd like that too. - How about tomorrow night? I can't. Tomorrow night I'm busy. - How about tonight? - Hey. - Okay? - Yes. - Okay. Uh, I'm on stage 21. - Yeah. - Give me a call later. - Stage 21. Bye. - Alright. Bye. - Bye-bye. - Oh, David. David. - Listen, David, we'd like to.. Fellas, why do you come to me with these cockamamie deals? I'm not interested in penny-ante participation. If you got a deal that's good for me, let me know. - How about I call you tomorrow? - Okay. Sorry. Producers. What have they produced? What movies? They don't make movies. They make deals. - Hi. How are you? - Let's go. Hi. - Thank you. - Sure. - There you go. - Thank you. - I'm on page 90, already. - Hey, that's great. Are you gonna read it when I finish? - Sure. Looking forward to it. - Thanks a lot. - Have a good evening. - Bye-bye. - So what's he writing? - Oh, a screenplay. - And you're helping him. - Well, sort of. That's very nice of you. I'm a nice guy. So where to? I don't care. Maybe we could go to Tips. Play backgammon. - I don't play backgammon. - Oh. Go to the Polo Lounge have a little after dinner drink. I don't have nine bucks. What? Nothing. You shoot pool? A little bit. I never thought I'd be playmate of the month let alone playmate of the year. Dah! Well, finally. You got a misspent youth. Hef taught me. Some teacher. Time out. Okay. What'll you have? Mmm. Whatever. Two whatever coming up. Mmm. Well, here's to extraordinary luck. Extraordinary luck. Mm. I've had my share of that lately. Yeah, I would say so. Starring role in a movie. I didn't have any lines though. So what? That's your face up there on that big silver screen. That's what counts. That's not bad for.. - How long since you were here? - Under two years I think. Rollin' right along, then. Well, Paul had a lot to do with it. Yeah, Paul. What about him? - I wish I knew. - Mm-hmm. You still love him? I don't know if I really ever did love him. I think I needed him more. He was a man, and he was there when I needed him. And your father hadn't been. How did you know? - Lucky guess. - Mm-hmm. Very lucky. - So you're gonna divorce him. - Mm-hmm. 'Eventually.' You don't sound too sure about that. I am. I just don't wanna hurt him anymore than I already have. What do you do in the meantime? I play pool and I exercise and I take some classes. I'm trying to find a place to live. - Aren't you living with Mindy? - Mm-mm. Staying with Mindy. There's a difference. You wanna stay here? - Is that a proposition? - No. I got nine bedrooms. You're welcome to any one you like. Including yours. [sighs] I just don't know if I could get into another relationship now. - Didn't offer you one. - Mm. Well, then.. Hi. - How was the meeting? - Oh, God, dreadful. - What, they want more changes? - Oh, yes. Um.. I don't wanna talk about it. - How was acting class? - Oh, fabulous. - Oh, was it? - I did an improvisation today. With Ralph and Helga even liked it. Oh, really? You got a compliment from her, that's like getting an Oscar. She said [German accent] "Now, when you speak I'm beginning to hear your soul." Whatever that means. When did you get home? Um...about two. I tried to call, the service kept picking up. I know. Um, the phone's been ringing all day. Is it him? I don't know. I just don't wanna find out. Mm-muah. I'm glad you're home. She's been missing you all day. Meow. Oh, you look terrible. Don't be so sad. [phone ringing] (woman on phone) 'David Palmer's residence, hold please.' Thanks a lot. Alright, there. Beer. I can always tell a beer-drinking man. Here you go. [indistinct] Thanks a lot. What'll it be, partner? Got a guy named Lyman here? Who's asking? I am. Gotta have a name. Snider. I'm Lyman. Where is it? It's in the truck. Let's go. - You got the cash. - I got it. Come on. Like I said on the phone, almost brand new. Ain't hardly ever been fired. - 185? - Right. 'Here.' 'Good huntin'.' [indistinct radio chatter] I don't know what I'd have done the last few months without you. I'm very glad that you didn't have to find out. Thanks. Thank you. For being here. And being you. Hmm. Coming up? - No. I wanna work for a while. - Oh. [grunts] Okay. Hmm. Muffin. Here. Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. Did you see her when we came in? No, I didn't. Hmm. Oh, well, goodnight. Goodnight, honey. Muffin. Where are you cat? Here. Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. Muffin. Here. Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. 'Muffin.' 'Muffin.' - Did you lose Muffin? - Yeah. Aw. She'll come back. But she's never stayed out all night. Probably chasing butterflies. - Hmm. Good morning. - Good morning. - You want some coffee? - Mm-hmm. [sighs] So how late did you stay up last night? - 3:30. - Mmm. So how's it going? I finished it. - You finished it? - Hmm. You finished it? Yeah. Can I read it? Don't you wanna finish your coffee? No. Now! Where is it? It's in the study. Oh, congratulations. Better save those until after you've read it. Why? What? Why does he have to die? [chuckles] 'Cause everybody dies. He had so much to live for. Did you like the Rachael character? I love her. You think you can handle that? You're offering it to me? 'If you want it.' No. I couldn't do it. I haven't studied enough. Would you please stop putting yourself down? David, you saw me yesterday. I was fumbling around. - I forgot lines. - Everybody does that at first. That's called learning how to act. Look, Dorothy, Jane Fonda you ain't. But you have a presence. You can hold the screen. You mean my body can hold the screen. No, not that. It's all more than that when she started. - I want more than that. - You have more than that. - 'Phew.' - Promise? I don't promise nothin', kid. [blows smoke] So, you want the part? Of course, I want the part. I just can't take it, that's all. David, I'm not ready. (David) 'Hello?' This is Paul Snider. Let me speak to my wife. Hello? Don't.. - Hi, Paul. - 'Dottie, I miss you.' - 'I miss hearing your voice.' - I'm sorry. And seeing your face and just holding on to you. I gotta see you today, Dottie. I can't. You promised me. I know I told you. I'm sorry. Listen to me. I'm desperate. I don't know what I'm gonna do to myself if I don't see you today. 'I know you're gonna come.' I know you will, baby. - Honey? - Hmm? My shift starts at about 4 o'clock. Thought you were just gonna go to Billy's. I'm getting my hair cut. What for? I told you. That NBC thing. - I'm not going to see him. - That's what you said before. I know. I was desperate. I didn't know what to do. Dorothy. I want you to stay away from him. You hear me? - David, I said-- - I know what you said. Now just do it. Okay. Oh, I got lipstick on you. I'll see you later. You've got a real chance at a wonderful future. It's just not gonna happen unless you dump that creep. - I'm going to. - You've said that before. I mean it this time. 'Billy, I've decided to settle with Paul.' I want you to drop the papers. No way. He's not getting one dime. - I can't cut him out. - Why not? - Because I owe him. - You owe him zip! I owe him everything. - 'No, you--' - Excuse me. He's on the phone for you. Tell him I've left. - I'll try. - 'Thanks.' [door shuts] Hey. You're not going over there, are you? No. You wouldn't lie to a friend, would you? No. 'You haven't heard?' No. [laughing] Oh, my dear. Roger moved in with Harry Simmons. I didn't know he was gay. Well, neither did Roger till he met Harry Simmons. [laughter] Oh, do you want the same nail polish? Mmm, yes. Helen, how much longer are you gonna be? Oh, half an hour. Look, I'm gonna catch a cab. You wanna meet later for drinks? No. I'm-I'm gonna.. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. How's David? Fine. That good, huh? I don't know. Just somebody else is pulling my strings. First it was Paul, now it's David. You don't need him, kiddo. Believe me. I need somebody. You've got somebody. You've got Dorothy. 'And you don't need a Paul or a David or anybody else.' Not anymore. You've got you. You're in control. I wish I was. Look, um, I've gotta get to Saxon before that creep cancels my charge account. You sure you don't wanna meet later for drinks? Maybe tomorrow for lunch. - We'll talk in the morning. - Okay. You have fun. - Your hair looks great. - Too short. You know, she's right. You don't need anybody. Look at you. How old are you? Twenty. [whispers] Twenty. Oh! What a life you've got ahead of you. [phone ringing] [ringing continues] - Hello? - 'Hi, auntie, it's me.' Dorothy! - 'Honey, is something wrong?' - No. Come on. I know that voice. Just called to see how your were. 'It's Paul, isn't it? What's he doing to you?' He's not doing anything. I haven't even seen him. 'How's Joanna?' Oh, she's fine. Listen, I thought I'd fly up next week. 'Oh, great.' - 'Is David coming with you?' - No. - But you're still together? - 'Yeah.' So when will you come? I don't know. I'll call you. I saw an ad for the space picture yesterday. 'You look terrific.' 'I'm so proud of you.' Listen, auntie, I'll call you later, okay? Give Joanna a big hug. - I'll call you next Sunday. - 'Dorothy, wait.' Please stay away from him. Please. I love you, auntie. 'Goodbye.' [intense music] [doorbell buzzing] Hi, babe. You look sensational. Well, come on in. Hold it. Let me see. - What? - Your hair. Turn around. Come on. Let me see the cut. Oh, that is sensational. I told you that Rudy's a wizard. - He didn't do it. - What are you talking about? - I told you to go to him. - I went to Freddie Paris. Freddie Paris is history. I wouldn't let Freddie Paris trim my chest. What do you want, Paul? How could you let him do your head like that? I thought you liked it. Hey, Artie. Ah, meet my wife Dorothy. Hello. Is this not the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? You ain't lyin', Paul. Where're you goin'? I gotta go to the cleaners. Listen, I'm taking a meeting with Sunny later. You still want in on the deal or what? Uh, yeah, if it's good. Paul, Sunny don't deal nothin' but. Yes, I'll admit. Nice meetin' you. Who's that? Oh, Artie. He's my partner. We got a giant deal goin' down. So.. [chuckles] What's happenin'? - Why'd you have to see me? - I don't know. A guy need a reason to see his wife? No. What's wrong? You know what's wrong. You're damn right I do. - He finally got to you. - Nobody got to me! He got to you! I'm gonna get him. You hear what I'm tellin' ya? - He cannot take my wife! - He didn't! You're living with him! - Paul-- - Don't deny it. I know you are. I know. What about your private detective? I didn't need him. I knew it already. Look, I don't feel I should have to justify anything to you but if it matters to-- This is Paulie! You can't jive me! I know the trick he's laying on you. I know that scam! You should. You've used it enough. [sighs] Would you listen to us? I'm sorry. My baby comes to visit, all we do is argue. You're mad at me, aren't ya? No. I'm through with you. [intense music] Don't say that! You never listen. I'm the one who tells you when it's over, not you. Do you understand that? I made you! You were nothin' but a dumb, ugly, two-bit piece of meat till I met you. You owe me! You haven't even started paying me back yet. Get up! No! Get into the bedroom and take your clothes off! - No! - Now you do it! - No! - Go inside! - No! - Go on! When I can't sleep I just lie there and try to remember every line in your face. Mouth, nose. And your eyes. Look at me. Please, Dottie, open your eyes. I wanna tell you somethin'. I never needed nobody in my life. Nobody. And then you came along and you changed all that. For the first time I was sharing myself. I was giving somebody part of me. I don't think I can make it without you, baby. I can't let you leave me. - It won't work. - Give it one more shot. I can't. That's it. Toilet time. You just get up and walk out of here. Dorothy Stratten big star. Like there never was a me. Like I never made it happen. I never said that! I always told people. 'I tried to pay you back.' How? By marrying you. That's what this was to you? A payback? - 'Some kind of--' - I cared about you. Oho-o-o! She cared for me! What is that supposed to mean? I mean, you make it sound like I was some orphan dog. Like you were laying some kind of pity trip on me. 'Is that what it was all about?' I didn't ask for it. I didn't ask for any of it. Till you came along I thought my life'd be a whole lot different. I wanted to have a house, and a couple...couple of kids. 'And a guy...I could just hang on to.' And then you came along. I don't know, maybe that's what I still want. I'm that guy, Dottie. I'll tell you what. I'm through with scammin'. Gonna take a job, a straight job. I got offers. I got lots of offers. No. You know what we'll do? We'll move back to Vancouver. Buy a house. I'll take care of ya. You and the twins. You thought I forgot about you wanting baby girls, huh? That was so long ago. That doesn't make any difference. We can still have 'em. In fact, we could start right now. [grunts] Look at that! He's poisoned you against me. - No. - He told you not to see me. If I'd listened to everybody I wouldn't have gone on a second date. Then how come we did? You gave me confidence. Made me feel like a woman. Told me I could be someone and not just some kid with a body. You touched me. You.. Now you got him ringing your chimes, you don't need me. I don't need anybody. What is happening? You're not sleeping with him-- - I never said-- - You better not! I got facts. - You do? - Damn right I do! And I'm gonna crucify you, and him too. Why won't you leave me alone? Because I have to have you here with me. Always next to me, so I can hold on to you and keep you safe. Do I have to burn it into your brain? Don't you get it? Every guy that sees you wants to own you. I'm not gonna let that happen! Neither am I! [intense music] I'm sorry, baby. 'I can't lose no more.' No more.
