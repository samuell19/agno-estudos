Don't look at my arm, sire. No, sire. Sire, sire, sire, sire. Sire, you can expect your ruthless, ravenous riders in but a fortnight. Hey, where you been? Okay. Audition tomorrow. New Ryan Murphy show! You told me eight o'clock. Okay, no. No, it's great, Neil, thank you, good night. I have to work. No. You said you would- - I know, I don't want to, there's just this fucking Excel thing, it's driving me insane. Excel? Yeah. You told me you would help with this. You promised. 20 minutes. Mmm! Sire, you can expect your ruthless, ravenous riders in but a fortnight! A fortnight? Dr. Munchausen sprays electricity out of his fingertips that Golok his feeble hunchback. Ah, lightning, oh! Babe. Are you even focusing on this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just give it a little more oomph, okay? Okay, let's try it again. Know what, this is, this is stupid. I'm not going to the audition. Oh come on, you have to go to the audition. You're really good! It's beneath me. An audition for a big TV show? No way, - come on. - My time would be better spent working on the Einstein script. Look, I think the script is a great idea. I think you've been working on it for four years and I've never seen you write a single page. I've got like 2500 notes in my phone right now. All different ideas pertaining to the flick. Okay, I'm sorry Nick, I'm exhausted. Just do whatever you want. Wait. You don't need to stay up all night doing this. I do, actually. No, it's really bad for you. You're like torturing yourself. Okay, I have a real job, so I have to do that. I have a real job too. Do you have any idea how hard it is to be an actor? Oh my god, do you? You blow the one audition you got this month? Do you just think you're gonna wake up and be an actor in the La La Land fantasy life - in your head? - You're so negative! You are a black hole from which no light or joy or time or anything can escape. I'm a black hole who pays your rent, who has to pay your car insurance, who has to schedule your doctor's appointments? Okay, I feel like - I'm your fucking emotional - I just can't do this anymore - I can't do this anymore. - support animal! Like what is the point of this? What, we're having an argument so you're gonna hit the eject button again? I want to break up. Well, I did it. So good, I'm so proud of you. Good for you, man, - honestly. - Thank you. It's hard, it fucking sucks. I know. I feel like shit. Yeah, man, I mean he is a leech. You're gonna feel really good really soon. Thank you. Yeah, it's just hard. He left, I don't know where he's staying. That's all right, you don't need to know. Yeah. Jeez, there's no one at my work. Have you checked your email? Maybe your work is canceled. What? This is for real. This pandemic is for real, like. I know. They shut down the NBA. Wait, the NBA shut down? Yes, and Thomas Hanks has it. Bro, like she's missing out. Like you're handsome, look at you, you're tall. You're taller than me. I wish I was that tall. You know, you're in shape. I got a belly on me, like you good bro. Any woman in the world will fall for you. Do you think I could stay with you guys for like a couple days till I get this figured out? I would love for you to come over and stay over but like this corona thing is crazy, bro. People are dying. And Jeanine, she's freaking out - right now. - Oh, wait a sec, man. It's my boss, hold on. I'll call you back. Hey, Steve, how's it going? Hey dude, not great. Look, turns out we don't need you to come into the bar tonight. In light of everything that's going on, we are closing indefinitely. Indefinitely? Financial experts warn that the impact on the US economy would be far reaching. An area outside New York City became the first to comply with the - containment strategy. - There is a growing concern about economic disruption. The coronavirus, now classified as a pandemic, has devastated the travel and tourism industry. Hi. Hey. It's crazy. It's insane. Can I get some of that? Yeah. No, you can do it. Overcome together as a nation and as a world. How's it going with Hector? Did you? No, Jeanine, she said no way. So you can't stay there? No, he said no way. What about Brian? He lives in Venice, right? Nope, immuno-compromised. He is? Mhmm. Is he okay? - Yeah, he's fine. - What's he have? - I didn't pry. - Okay. Doesn't Olivia live in Burbank? Couldn't she? Why? You want me to move in with my ex-girlfriend? I meant your cousin, Jesus. All right. Yeah, she does, but they just had a kid. I don't want you to move in with Olivia Feret. Okay! You gotta be specific. Uncle's cabin, Big Bear, on the lake, you got the woods. No way. That is a great idea. Why do you think it's vacant? There's no electricity. There's no running water and it's 100% haunted. It's haunted? Yes, it's haunted. What about getting in a hotel for two weeks? Leah, I just lost my job. You can reevaluate in two weeks. I just lost my job. Okay, okay. - Okay. - Okay. Well let's just hope this ends soon. It's supposed to clear up miraculously when it warms up. Who said that? Dr. Trump. We've been seeing a mix of misinformation being circulated on various social media platforms. One conversation that's coming up a lot is about self-test or at-home tests. Kick him out! You have to get him out of there! I can't, I can't kick him out. Where is he gonna go? He has like 12 dollars and, That's not your problem! You wanna talk about boundaries? That's a boundary. You're not his mom! How am I supposed to create boundaries? I can't even go outside. You can go outside. You just have to wear a mask. I'm not going out yet, okay? Look, I have it under control. What is the, no, don't smell your hair, don't. Oh my god! Like just, if you would just see that he sucks! But he doesn't suck. He's just working on himself. How long does it take to work on yourself? A lifetime! People become doctors in less time than it's taking him to work on himself. Have you guys thought of doing couples therapy? No. Hi, Hank. Hey. Nick, can I talk to you for a second? We're not allowed to hang out with people. Why is Hank here? What's your problem with Hank? I don't have a problem with Hank. We're in the middle of a global pandemic. Yeah, exactly. We gotta stick together - in times like this. - Oh my god, no. Well, then go live with Hank. I can't live with Hank. He's in between homes right now. He lives in his van. Then you need to ask him to leave. You ask him to leave. Fine. Hank, can you leave? Okay. This is Governor Gavin Newsome giving this order last night. A state as large as ours requires at this moment that we direct a statewide order for people to stay at home. This is the first statewide order of its kind. It's unclear how enforcible these measures are, and without a Federal decree, states are left to implement their own procedures to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a little low. You might be low on your white blood cells. That's not what that means. You need to eat some iron. I think I have some iron pills. Hey, hey, hey, don't come in. What? Take your clothes off and put them in here and I'll wash them, okay? - Really? - Yup. I was at the grocery store, not the morgue. Is that it? You have to wash them for 30 seconds. That was 30. It was a quick 30. That was like three seconds. What, are you counting for me? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy 30th birthday to you ♪ Okay. ♪ Happy birthday to me ♪ I'm turning 30 and that's really exciting And I'm comfortable with that 'cause that's young and a really awesome age You think it'd be possible maybe I could come back, stay with you guys in New York for a little bit? Maybe move home? You know, I'd love to have you here. It's probably the worst time in my lifetime for you to come back to Manhattan. Hi, Claire. I'm in the market for a studio apartment right now. Know what sort of budget you would like to work with? So I can go, my budget's around 500 and I could go 550 in a pinch. Um, our studio apartments stand at about 1600 and it's up from there. 1600? Nick, forgot your mask. Oh yeah. Got it. Great, okay, okay. I'd like you to think through how you would solve this completely on your own. - All right. - Come up with a plan. No, I can do this. I can figure it out. Can you put on a mask, please? Okay, Jesus. Where the fuck? Oh god, Jesus. Here, how's that? Thank you. So I know in the past we've discussed me taking on more responsibility. I really am interested in the strategy team. And I know that there might be a promotion available. So I was just hoping we could discuss. Let me stop you right there - one second. - Okay, of course. I don't know if we can make moves on anything. I frankly don't even know what we're gonna be doing in three months. Right. The travel industry has been torpedoed hard. We really do need everybody to kind of batten down the hatches and stay the course. Stay the course. And we can just circle back, revisit this in a little while. When this all, yeah, gets better. Yeah, great. I gotta be honest with you. The city's shut down. There are no productions. I mean like, for the first time I can get from Santa Monica to Silver Lake in 15 minutes and there's a good reason why. Yeah, I really need the money right now. I'm open to taking anything. I just need a W. All right, first thing I'm just lookin' at is, oh, actually this is theater, this is live theater. So it's 'Death Of A Salesman' We're looking at - the Willy Loman role. - Yes. You know I can nail this. Right. Yes, this is what I'm talking about. I mean the only catch here is that this is part of, it's part of a cruise line leaving Miami in two weeks. It'll be traveling from Miami to Cozumel, Mexico. On a cruise? Yeah, it's a cruise, looks like this is a cruise liner. Aren't people on cruises getting sick? Like, at a really rapid rate? Isn't that like very dangerous? It's very dangerous. They're getting crazy sick. I would really not recommend you take this role. My name is Nick Bole. I'm auditioning for the role of Granny Agnes in Untitled Student Project. Honey, honey? I made cupcakes for you and you're gonna love them! Hey Charlie, it's time for the big birds and the bees chat. Come up on Granny's lap! Jesus Christ. Thank you. Hey babe, I mean Leah, do you know where the 1099s are? No, I don't have a 1099. Okay, do you know where mine is? No. Reach out to your payroll company maybe, see if they can forward it to you? Mark doesn't use payroll. I mean what if I was just paid in cash? Hey, Leah, what if I was just paid in cash? I don't know. Well could I just use yours for this? No! Why is that funny? That's my information that would say I'm still employed - first of all. - No, I know. I'm saying, I'll take out your information and I'll put mine in. I'll use it as like a template. I don't know if I feel comfortable with you working for a delivery service. No way. You disagree with what I wanna do, wow. I'm just saying personally for me, with a partner who doesn't even wanna wear a mask when he goes outside - on a run. - I would. Who doesn't wanna wear gloves to the grocery store. I don't feel comfortable with you going out, interacting with a lot of people and then tracking whatever god knows what home. I would wear the mask. The two dollar cure for coronavirus that really works. - See, exactly, this is it. - I would wear it. But I would do it. I'll pay the bills for a couple weeks which is honestly really fucking nice of me. And then you can leave and go work for whatever delivery service you want, okay? Okay, so I don't have a job and you're paying, it's like I'm working for you living in this apartment - just by - Well that's not new. This is such bullshit. It's almost 10 and I have a meeting, okay? Okay great. Let's talk about this later. Mhmm. I'm not trying to hurt you. I have to do a lot of things I don't wanna do either. Right. All right. I hope you wear a mask for that call. You're literally such an idiot. I thought you were going in there. Why did you just turn around, what happened? So the Treasury Department is asking for about 30% of the aid, the bigger airlines to be in the form of loans. And the government is also requesting warrants that are 10% of the loan. We'll see how negotiations play out but the way things are going in this administration we may not even have a treasury secretary next week. So, who knows. All right, yes, we got like five. Morning. Don't bullshit me, are you all right? Or are you playing hide and seek in the house with your girlfriend's ghost? Don't let her be the alpha. You leave an unflushed shit in the toilet every once in a while. Let her know you live there. - Send a message. - All right. Ni hao. Nick, it's 11 o'clock at night. You said I could play the Rhodes whenever I want. ♪ Ni hao ni hao ni hao ni hao ni ♪ ♪ Hao ni hao ♪ ♪ Ni hao ni ♪ Hey, have you seen the night cream? Night cream? Yeah. Night cream. No. Guess you're gonna have to buy some more. I'm not planning to go to Japan anytime soon. Just get it here. It's like 300 bucks a pop. Shouldn't be a problem for you. Right? Are you serious right now? Hey, I'm pissed too. I went in 50-50 on that. That's a huge loss. Your skin looks very supple. Why, thank you. Thank you very much. I've looked in all the places where he usually hides things. He has three places. And they are not there. So I'm like where the fuck is this moisturizer? Well that must be really upsetting. He's just being such a jerk about this. I'm on my Zoom calls all day, I'm looking at myself and I just see that my skin is dry. I'm distracted by it and I think if I had the moisturizer I would just feel more confident. Does this upset you because it reminds you of your trip together to Japan? Oh. Sorry, I think you froze. Amy, can you hear me? Fuck! Did you change the Netflix password? Sure did. Can I have it? Can you have the password to my Netflix account? The one I pay 15.99 a month for? Mmm, I don't think so. What's your deal, dude? All right, it's like that? You know my fucking deal, asshole. Hi, how's it going? This is kind of weird. I'm getting used to it. Have you done any of these before? Yeah, I've done like five of these today. Today? All right. It's actually not that bad as long as like, you have good internet. Yeah. I have to tell you, I actually liked your profile because you look a lot like this guy Brian from... Do you watch The Bachelorette? No joke, we had a connection. Like a vibe was there. This artistic cohesion, you know what I mean? The way you speak about her, like you are very intrigued by this girl. Yeah. Leah, kind of wet blanket. This girl, sun dress on the first spring day in New York City, know what I mean? Hi. Do you mind keeping it down a little bit or maybe just not playing altogether right now? I'm trying to work. You got it. Thank you. Work hours are 10 to six, again. I don't know. They said they're freezing out the employees, no one's moving, I'm definitely not getting a promotion. I feel lucky we still have our jobs, to be honest with you. I think like six million people applied for unemployment just last week. It like crashed the system. I know. I don't know. I feel like as long as we can hold on, you know. Like, even if it is a sinking ship. So scary. Yeah, it's really just fucked up. Okay, well it was nice to talk. Well hey, you know, I don't know what you're doing but I was about to make myself a drink if you wanna have one with me. Sounds nice. Yeah, that sounds good. Just give me one second. I just have to find my wine. I think the quarantine is hard for everybody but it's a little bit harder I think when you're single. - Yeah. - It's just like so fucking lonely. Yeah. It's tough. No, I know, I mean, I feel the same way. It's hard being alone right now. I thought you... Don't you have a boyfriend? Or don't you live with somebody? Well, actually my boyfriend and I broke up right before quarantine started. Oh my god, so he moved out? Sort of, yeah. Yeah, he moved to the living room. Oh. So we're still living together but we've been trying to create really strict boundaries. You know, he's in the other room. We hardly interact and it's so clear that we've both just moved on. And he's been even dating so, Oh my god, - that's amazing. - Yeah. Yeah, and I'm really happy for him, so. Super mature of both of you I think. Yeah, it's been good. Dude, I gotta get out of there, man. As soon as I get this stimmy check, - I'm bouncing, 100%. - Where you gonna go? Anywhere. I'll live in my car. I just can't be around her anymore. I feel bad for you, my friend. Are you going on any auditions or submitting? I've been submitting. I haven't gotten any callbacks. It's really tough. There's nothing out there right now. I've been reading for like student films, weird foreign animated shows. You know Eddie Murphy did Shrek? Nobody thought Shrek was gonna be this big. Yeah, but he got paid millions of dollars for that. Exactly, but you not Eddie Murphy. - Stop complaining. - Dude, I'm trying, man. It's part of the hustle, you gotta do all of this. I'm doing it. How you doing though? I'm okay. My cousin in New York, he has corona. Really? Yeah, my whole family is like devastated. You know, I talk to them everyday. He's quarantined, nobody could be with him. Oh, shit man, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. Wish I could give you a hug right now. Wish I could give you a hug. Mhmm, come here, air hug. - Air hug. - Air hug. I feel that too, mmm. You know what, 10 years from now we're gonna remember that we're in the middle of a pandemic eating salad, talking about life. You alive? Yeah. You sick? No. What's going on? Hey, Leah, this is Craig. I want to reach out and see how you're doing. Really enjoyed working with you the last couple years and I'm really sad to see you go. So again, this isn't about performance or anything like that. It's just a crazy time for everybody. Anyway, you should definitely reach out to HR to get the full download on our exit package, and, Well. I mean, it's happening to everyone. Yup. Happened to me. Okay. Happened to you, - happened to the - Okay, okay. Neighbor probably. Can you leave? Can you leave now thank you. Thank you, that made me feel better. - Okay. - Okay, bye. Close the door please, bye. Okay. Okay. You don't want it open a little? Please leave and close the door now! Jesus. Who's ready for their morning coffee? Here we go. Developing a vaccine, testing it quickly, and trying to get it ready so that we'll have a vaccine available. I know we'll be successful in putting this down but we really need to be prepared for another cycle. I think like we're gonna see a lot of closure. It's like arguing to not treat a sick person until they're on their deathbed. We really have done this right. The problem is the press. Just how deep is the crisis for the world economy? The SMP500 has undergone its fastest bear market decline in history. Sweet. I'm sorry. So I can't change my healthcare plan even though I just lost my job? Unfortunately, your situation doesn't qualify for our special- - What would qualify? I just lost my job, what could be a more qualifying event? Marriage, serious near fatal injuries or birth of a child. Wow. My question to you. Get you, get you. And you know what, that's why nobody trusts the media anymore. No I'm not married and I just broke up with my boyfriend, for your information. But I don't know, maybe I should forge a marriage to get your bullshit healthcare. I'm sorry to hear that you're distressed Miss Russo. I'm distressed because I don't have $600 a month. You can reach out 24/7. I don't need to hear about how I can reach you 24/7. What I want is to reach you right now and to get healthcare that is affordable and that will, the plan that you're talking about for 270, Have you been having anything like a fever or a cough, or shortness of breath? Any of those kind of symptoms? Well we've been taking our temperature pretty much every day. I have, today it was 98.9. So it's right on the verge, you know? I don't know if that counts. She hasn't had a fever at all - this entire time. - I just told him I had a 98.9. That's not a fever, - that is- - Well he's a doctor. He can determine that. Sorry. No, that would not be a fever. That's still in the normal range. Okay. Yeah. I mean, if you want my two cents, He doesn't. So what do you think? It sounds like you've been pretty much staying inside, right? You haven't been out, you haven't been around other people. Anybody you've been around have any symptoms of coronavirus, anything like that? I have been going outside a lot in the yard and recently I heard our neighbors coughing and there was quite a gust of wind that day. And I don't know if it got in my eyes. She hasn't left the house in weeks. So I find it highly unlikely that she's been around anyone who has it. Thank you. The thing is, is that he's left the house. He's gone to the grocery store, and he's not quite careful. And I'm sorry, you are? Are you a family member or? I am, it's complicated, I'm her roommate now. Yeah, my roommate. - Right. - Okay. And she does have a tendency, no offense, to worry a little bit. In this case I think she's kind of obsessing over the news and watching the death count, and she just lost her job. She's not really eating well, she's up all night. Do you think it could be, you know, related to that? Really, from the symptoms you're describing and from the situation, no known exposures, it seems very unlikely that what you're describing is coronavirus. Okay. It sounds, I think far more likely your symptoms are related to stress. Yeah, I mean I guess I'm under a little bit of stress. But I will say a lot of that stress is that I have this crazy unfortunate situation where I'm actually quarantining with my ex boyfriend. And he's... It's Nick. And he's a terrible communicator and he's really, I don't know if there's a medication you could give to Nick that would help me be less stressed. Are you kidding me? Or just something we could do - to make this less stressful. - Let me just chime in here. I really am not in a position that I can be prescribing any medication for Nick. I'm no relationship counselor. I mean what I've tried to do with my wife is just try to look at it from the other person's perspective sometimes. Just trying to see where they're coming from. And what I would recommend is that you do something relaxed, do some things to get your mind off the stress in your life than I think you can feel better. Okay. That's helpful. - Thank you. - All right. Come on. LA with no traffic. Soak it up while it lasts. They said the air quality's never been better in LA. There you go. You know what I'm hearing? Gratitude. I actually think it's false optimism because this is only going to create more white flight out of major cities, - New York, Chicago, LA. - Whoah, whoah, whoah. - Whoah, whoah, whoah. - Then the suburbs are gonna grow. And then all of a sudden it's gonna be way worse for the environment 'cause everyone's gonna be driving and no one's gonna want to take public transportation. Subways, trains, over. You think three months of no traffic is gonna - fix the environment? - Look, I'm just talking about right now in this very moment, there's no traffic in LA and that's pretty awesome. Yeah. Goddamit, there's no parking. This lot's full, full. Full. Are you fucking kidding me? Look at all of these people on the beach. Ayayay. None of them are wearing masks. Well, two of them are wearing masks. Hey buddy! Put on a mask! Maybe we should just go home. - I have a headache. - No, we're not going home. We're gonna find a spot, but. I'm just saying. Let's just calm down. People shouldn't be out like this. Well, look, we're kind of out like this too, so. It's different. I know, we're safe obviously. Where are we going? You know, I don't know exactly. Just trust that the universe will give us a gift right now. - Let's try that. - Why the fuck would I trust the universe? This is perfect. I am locked in the car. Did I lock you in? It's okay. Can you hold this please? Yeah. So we've got some chips, some dips, and, - seven layers of heaven. - Oh my gosh. I can't believe we found this place. I was actually trying to find where Matthew McConaughey lived and, what? - Here, hand sanitizer. - Oh! Look at you. Eating with your hands without chemicals on them? That's not something to celebrate in a pandemic. It is. We want clean hands when we eat. No, we need to celebrate normality - and the glimpses of it - Oh my god. that we get. You sound like, I don't wanna say it. What? I don't know how you're so calm about this. I don't know how you can worry the whole time during this. It's not like I'm trying to freak out about it. It's just every time I think about what I'm gonna do with my life, - how I'm gonna get another job, - Right, but look, look, you're like, you're thinking way too far in the future. Just like, right now, we're having a nice little picnic. It doesn't mean we don't care about other shit going on in the world, but like we're still allowed to live a little bit. Like, we've got to. Well, I think, completely ignoring the news, not wanting to wear a mask, pretending we're not in a pandemic isn't necessarily the right way to go either. I'm not saying it is. It's good to be informed and all that. You know, I read the news. Headlines, maybe, mainly. But it comes down to acceptance. I've accepted where we're at. I'm not trying to change anything with us. I'm coming to acceptance of that and it's making it a lot easier. I feel like- - Not gonna play that Rhodes anymore at midnight? Yeah, I feel like tormenting you, like 20% less now. Okay, great. The sooner I started to accept that things between us were over, the sooner I could like see you as a friend again or stop hating you. 'Cause for a while it was like I love you so much that it's impossible to not hate you. But, work in progress, babe. Oh my god, look how beautiful this is. What do you think its name is? I'd say that's definitely Rupert. - Rupert? - Uh huh. That's so stupid. Yeah it is. Mr. Einstein. Is it eight o'clock? Gotta be. Ooh. Day 30 of quarantine. This I feel like - I'm fuckin' - Oh shit. Yeah. That's pretty good. I'm gonna win, ready? One, two, three. - Jesus Christ! - Woo! What the fuck? Yeah, yeah! Oh, like there's so much more to fucking Einstein than E equals MC squared. That's only some stupid equation that like people can write that's really short. But the real thing is the general theory of relativity. Imagine that in a movie! Oh my god, we're gonna prove Einstein's theory in war time. Holy shit, we're getting arrested. Yeah. That's fucking crazy! It's almost like if you could tell the story in like a non-linear way. Wait, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down. It's not linear. Yeah, it's like a circular story. I really hope you write your script. It sounds really cool. I think you just, you just found the missing piece. - Oh my god! - Oh my god! Did I just hit you - in the face? - In the nose! Oh my god, - I'm so sorry. - What the fuck, dude? Faster, let's go! Ooh, oh! Down, down, down. You have to brush your teeth, you have to brush your teeth. There, okay. Mwah, Stop, no way! Fuck me silly, girl! Hey. Hi. - How'd you sleep? - What's up? Well, I think. I mean one part of it was well. How did you sleep? Good. - Fun night. - You know, one of those drunk sleeps where you wake up dehydrated at like five a.m. But besides that it was good. Yeah, that was a good night. You see my bullseye right there? That's not a bullseye. It's close. Looks pretty good. Oh shit. How fucking drunk was I? You got a bullseye? I don't know. That's the most fun I've had in months, I think. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. We probably, um, I don't know, I think we were just really drunk. That is for sure. There's no contesting that. Yeah. So. Yeah I don't know if we were thinking totally straight, you know? Yeah. Right. Definitely drunk. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. No, it was fun. Fun night. Fun night. No regrets, but no, maybe we should just, you know, - not drink. - Oh. - Yeah, no no no. - Together. We don't have to make a weird thing of it. Yeah, for sure. I figured you wouldn't want to either. No, I'm cool. Yeah. - Yeah. - Just complicates things, you know? Say no more. I was thinking the same thing. Yeah? Cool. All right, well. I'll see you later. Okay. I got work to do. What are you gonna do? Fucking told you it would happen. I said this is where it starts, man. You guys are gonna cuddle up, then you're gonna get drunk, then you're gonna hook up. And then before you know it you're gonna be married, you're gonna have a bunch of kids, you're gonna put all this trauma onto those kids and then you're gonna be pissed and then he's gonna leave you later in life. - That's sad. - Okay. Okay, let's calm down. That's not what's happening here. We just slept together one time. How do you think you walk a mile, man? One step at a time. We were drunk and had a good day and it just happened naturally, man. It was beautiful and hot and it reminded me of when we were first dating. So you guys getting back together or what? You know, it's the first thing that points to that happening, so it could be. Look at you, you happy. I could see it in your face. You're gonna keep getting hurt and you just keep prioritizing his feelings so like I don't know what else I could possibly tell you if you're not gonna try, you know? I'm glad, I'm glad this happened. Really? Just be careful, okay? Thanks, man. Just be very careful. Do you think we could just keep living together but not do sex more? Jesus Christ, no! I do not think that. If you find yourself distracted, take a moment to re-center yourself. Breathe deeply. Remember to use your breath. You don't need to be anywhere else. You are exactly where you need to be. What you got there? Just a box with a book in it. LSAT? That's what it is, yeah. Thinking about applying to law school. That's cool. Law school, wow. Yeah, figured I had my stimmy check lying around, might as well spend it on something useful. It's too obvious for her to feed it to a tiger. Like that's, No, you put it through the meat grinder first. Then you feed the meat to the tiger. That's what it was, disgusting. That's mob shit, that's what the mob did. Meat grinder, baby. Oh yeah, there is that scene in The Sopranos. Right? With what's his name? - Christopher. - Hold on, I'll be right back, I'll be right back. My friend is here. Your what? Who? - Hey! - Hi! - Oh my gosh. - Hi. - It's so good to see you. - How are you? Yeah, nice to see - you too. - I can't believe you're here. I know. Well you know, I live down the street - so it's easy, easy trip. - I know. Yeah. A friend of mine is a baker. He bakes this amazing walnut bread. - And I just wanted to - Oh my gosh. Bring you some. Sorry about the whole job thing. Thank you, that is so thoughtful. You must be Nick. - I am. - Oh. - Yes, this is Nick. - Hey, man. I'm Tim. - Tim. - Yeah. Delivering something? Yes. Well, not delivering it. He brought me some bread. You know what, let me get my gloves. They're sitting right inside. I just have to find them. - Smart. - So I'll be right back. All right. So how you been, man? I'm good, yeah. What have you been up to? Right now I'm studying for the LSATs actually. Whoah, LSAT, no shit? Yeah, I decided to take the plunge into the field of law. God, that's quite a punch. It really is, yeah. The commitment that takes is just, - good for you. - Thank you. Follow through. And you are? I work at Canoe. - Yeah, on the strategy team. - Oh, got it. Yeah. I guess, you know, they need some people aboard the old sinking ship. Sure, yeah well. That's right, yeah, you know? - Go down the ship. - Oh, buddy. I wouldn't touch your face. Oh, sure, yeah. It's all right, easy mistake, but that's kinda how the spread continues, so. Sure, sure, sure, sure. We're just trying to be one of the good guys here, you know? I can tell, yeah, I can tell. So, you baked the bread? No, my friend. My friend baked the bread. Oh. I just brought it. No, that looks tasty. I can't wait to eat it. Too bad she's got a gluten allergy. Oh, she does? - Yeah. - Wow, that's too bad. I didn't know that. - She has a severe- - Sorry. It took me forever to find - my gloves. - Oh, hey. They were in my bag from the other day. Okay, gloves are ready. - Yes, perfect. - Thank you, this looks incredible, - oh my god. - My pleasure, - my pleasure. - Look at this! And it's natural rye so it does have gluten, just FYI. Oh, great. - Cool. - Okay. I just didn't know if that would be a problem or something. Oh. - No. - We were joking before. I told him a joke about gluten. This is so kind of you. I've been really craving homemade bread. - So, yeah. - Oh perfect, wow. Serendipitous. Totally. - Hey, thanks a lot, man. - Yes, please. - I really appreciate it. - Hey. So nice to meet you, man. - Yeah. - Really good meeting you too, man. You have a good energy. All right, let's hit the road. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm so glad you guys got along - so well. - Me too. Yeah, good guy. Can't believe he did that. Yeah, real nice. I know. How does he even know where we live though? Well, we carpooled together a few times. So creepy, just show up like that? I kind of want like a lighter wood but the contractor was like, darker is sort of in right now - so, - Hmm. I think it's sort of like a, like dark oak. How long have you owned this place? I bought during the like east side dip about six years ago, so. Six years ago? Jeez. So are you thinking about getting into the market? Maybe. Yes, yeah I mean yes I am. Maybe once, you know, I get another job. My broker is amazing. I'll throw him your number for sure. I'll tell him to give you a call. Awesome, thank you. How did you end up designing your place like this? It looks so beautiful. I find a lot of inspiration in a lot of different places. I'm a big fan of like mid century modern. You know, Schindler and Neutra. What about you? What are some of your design tastes? I think the main influence when we were designing the place was just, you know, memories? Just the concept of memories, I would say. Just the spatial relationship you have between you and your memories. Sure, wow. Memories, yeah, that's powerful. What are you up to today? You know, probably just meeting up with a huge group of friends. Day drinking, bar hopping, maybe we'll get our nails done. Probably gonna share a lot of plates, some tapas. - Yeah, yeah. - Nice. What about you? I got this hospital tour going on. Mmm. - Free admission. - Really? - Wow. - Might be fun. Yeah, sounds really fun, cool, normal, safe. Tonight, we should watch another Too Hot To Handle. We should. But I have this virtual movie night thing with a friend. Yeah? You can watch without me if you want. Mmm-mmm. I should probably study anyway, so. Tomorrow. Mmkay, yeah, raincheck. Excuse me. Three, two, one. Rashomon. I wish I were you so I could watch it for the first time. Oh, it's in black and white. Yeah. Nice. Yeah you know, I prefer Kurosawa to Ozu. Yeah. No, I feel the same way. Yeah I think Ozu's can be a little bit like too contemplative for me. But Kurosawa, you know, just super muscular shots and amazing storytelling. Oh, look at that horse. I love that I'm watching a movie with somebody. I feel like it's been so long since I've done anything with anybody, so. Yeah, same. I feel like drive-ins are- - Drive-ins! We should go to a drive-in, yes. Is it weird if like we go to a drive-in and like park next to each other? Is that weird? No, we should totally do that. This movie is very intense. They're kissing violently right now. Motherfucker. Her worst shame is that she slept with two men. Oh, I'm way like past that. You're past that? What are you seeing right now? I'm seeing, they're in the woods, there's trees. Yeah, Mifune just got shot like with a bunch of arrows. What? - How'd that happen? - Hey. Hey. Some of us are trying to study here. - Okay, sorry. - All right? Okay. Sorry. Just, Nick's trying to study. No, that's okay, yeah. Yeah. Hi. So how'd the studying go? Jesus! What the fuck? What happened? What a cutie, she's so playful. She's a little moody. She's giving me some sass right now. Mmm, you guys are in a fight? Well, you know. She's got a lot of energy. She's, you know, bred to pull a sled 100 miles a day. I wish I had a dog right now. Yeah, you know, I wish I had a person right now, so. Yeah. Well hey, we're gonna go on a walk 'cause she's about to have like a meltdown. Oh, okay. Well it was nice to hang. You wanna come with us? Oh. I don't know. I mean I want to, but, I haven't really been, you know, interacting with people. We can like, we can keep our distance, you know. I can walk on one side, you can walk on the other side. Scout can, - we can be a Scout sandwich. - She'll be in the middle. Yeah, so like a socially distanced walk. Exactly. Okay. You wanna go on a walk with Leah? Yeah? Hey. Hey, where you going? Just going for a walk. Listen to a podcast, take some time outside. All right. Okay. Wear a mask. Okay. You're so pretty. So is it okay if I take this guy off? Just when no one's around? Um. I feel like we're - probably all right. - Yeah, let's do it. I can see your face. Yes. So you know, Nick, he seems like a swell guy. Oh, does he? Yeah. How's that going? You know, it's really hard. We were together for a while. Four years. Oh, wow. That's a long time. Yeah, so. He's really getting on my nerves if I'm being honest, and I can't wait for him to move out because we're not getting along. Oh, wow. Yeah I think we're both having a hard time. You know, I know you didn't ask for my advice or anything but in my experience, Ooh, sorry. No, please. In my experience, you know I think the best way to get over somebody is just move on to the next thing. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's hard in quarantine, but, You're right. Yeah, forget what I just said. Never mind, I'm sorry. We're trying , we're trying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. The fuck? God. They had to do something. It's so great. - Thank you. - It's like a stick and pop? So do you not have any tattoos? No tattoos. Good for you. - Is it? - You can't go wrong with nothing, you know? That's true. So actually, these are a part of a hidden staircases of LA. Oh wow, I have that book, I think, all the staircase walks? Exactly. Yeah, it's really cool, very historical. So this is me. Whoah, right on the staircase. That's right. - Backyard. - It's an awesome house. Thank you. Well, do you wanna, wanna glass of water or something? Oh, that actually sounds really good. Yeah. But I should probably go. I don't think I should come in the house. Are you sure? No, I'm not sure. I don't know what to do. Okay, well maybe you can just get me a glass of water and we can drink it on your porch or something? Water on the porch. Okay. Cool. Okay. Cool. Come on, babe, let's go. Where you been? Hey, just went for a really long walk. I listened to all of Jessica Simpson's memoir. So, pretty crazy stuff. Yeah, sounds riveting. Yeah. Okay. What are you playing? Just writing something. Oh my god, that's so great! Yeah, it was fun, it was really fun. No, really great, oh my god! I did hook up with someone during a pandemic, so. Yeah. But you already did it, so. Yes, it's done. I can't take it back. You can't take it back. I know. Poor Nick. No. 'Cause you guys aren't together, right? Yeah. No, we're not, we're broken up. Ah. I don't know, just keep this going. Maybe I will. I mean, he owns a house, so I'm like, what the fuck? He owns? Yes. Hey. Hi. You have a sec? Sure. So, this might not even be on your radar, but the other night in the kitchen I dropped a glass and I thought maybe it scared you a little bit, so, Hmmm. I don't know. Doesn't ring a bell? Oh, I remember. I left my wine glass and you picked it up and you threw it against the cabinets, and it shattered and the glass shards went everywhere, and, I could see - how it would seem that way. - possibly into my body. That night, I remember that. The house was in disarray and I decided to take it upon myself to clean. Your glass was there. I was just kind of working up a sweat, elbow grease, and just popped it over the old shoulder, and bada bing bada boom. This is your apology? What I came here to say was I'm sorry for cleaning so aggressively. - No. - Because of the pressure that I'm dealing with in my life. No. I'm sorry for dropping a glass. Nope. I was angry and I threw a glass because I'm hurt. There you go. Hey, come on, don't pull that - on me right now. - That wasn't so bad, right? - I'm not, - I'm trying to bare my soul. I'm saying thank you, I appreciate that apology. And I accept it, don't worry about the glass, thank you. I was stressed out about the LSAT, and yeah, I screwed up. Do you really wanna be a lawyer? That's the plan. It just doesn't seem like you, you know? Well, maybe the old me, but I think the new me is a lawyer. You know it's like a lot of work, and then you have to go to law school and then you have to, It's a performance. You get to captivate the jury and the judge, and the cameras and the photos and the post, you know, news conferences after the trial. I thought it was much more about the paperwork and I think you try to settle most of the time and you only go to court like once every three or four years. No, I think the paperwork, that's handled mostly by the judge, I think. Hmm. So I'm gonna head back in - and study. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Good chat. Good chat. It's pretty therapeutic. It's cool how much you know how to do. I feel like quarantine's making me feel like such a failure. Everyone's baking bread and learning to, I don't know do, make homemade masks and cook - and make their own clothes. - Wait, what are you doing right there? I said put it in. I'm putting it, oh. You gotta put it in the fabric, don't just put - pins on a piece of paper. - I was putting it through here into the fabric. You're useless. - But look at this, huh? - Okay, I get it. Hey, that's pretty good. Was that the right way? Huh? Yeah! It's a start, it's good. Are you kidding? This is COVID's worst nightmare right here. Hold on, I'll be right back. Hi, how are you? I'm doing well, I'm doing well, yeah. You know, hanging out. Yes, yeah. Yeah, how are you? I'm good. Yeah, I'm good. - Good. - What's up? Well, you know, I just wanted to call and say that I had a really good time the other day. Yes, same, same. Okay, cool, well. You know, text me. Yeah, no, I will, for sure. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, well. - I'll talk to you later. - Talk to you soon. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. Sorry. Holy shit, is that what you just made? Yeah. No! Look good? Yes, let me see it. What the fuck? - You know. - Are you kidding me? Yeah, you know. - It's just what I do. - Look, you got the nose part - all right too. - Oh wow, that looks good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Your turn. - Congratulations. No, I don't know - how to do that. - Get in there. No, let me just do this part. Please. You gotta learn at some point. It's a useful skill. Okay, okay. Now, take this. Okay. The star, and you've been like wandering around, getting with whoever you please and it's not fair. Oh my god, this girl really needs to chill. Like, pick another one. So I think I'm allergic to bees. Isn't everyone allergic to bees? But like deathly allergic. I've never been stung by a bee, but, Why do you think that? Well they say bees are you know, less likely to sting people who are lethally at risk. Really? They have some kind of way of sensing it. Smart of the bees. Nice of them. So, I've been thinking, and decided I'm gonna take Hector up on his offer. Really? Yeah. Isn't the garage like a storage garage with no bathroom or like, - a sink? - Yeah. He's got buckets, and, yeah, who needs a kitchen? You're sleeping on the floor? Yeah, couch has a dip in it so I'm just gonna try this out. It's kinda comfy. Okay, sorry. It's all good. You know, you can sleep in the bed. Really? Yeah, of course. - It's no problem. - No, you got your back. No, come on. - Seriously. - Take the bed. No, no. I'm fine here, I promise. Okay. Good night. Good night. Well, if you don't mind. Nick? Hmm? You shouldn't live in a garage. You should stay here till you find a real place. Are you sure? Mhmm. Okay. Yeah, sounds good. Hey, excuse me. Hey, Leah, it's Tim. So I have been feeling under the weather. Nothing major but, I'm just gonna cut right to the chase and say it. I tested positive for COVID. You know, they told me to notify anybody that I've been in contact with for the last two weeks, so obviously I'm calling you. And no need to be all freaked out. - Hey. - Hey. I made coffee for you. Oh, thank you. What are you up to today? I don't know. Probably gonna work out and get some writing done. I don't know, what about you? I don't know either. Probably do some reading. Nice. What? So look, I just got some news from Tim, my coworker? It turns out that he has COVID. 19? - Yeah, yeah. - Sorry, shit. Is he okay? I don't know. I mean, he left me a voice mail to let me know. But I haven't talked to him. So hopefully he's okay. Fuck. Yeah, it's unfortunate. And you know, I did see him recently. When did you see him? The day I said I was going on the walk to listen to that audiobook, I was actually going on a walk with Tim. You know, we were broken up, I didn't wanna rub it in your face - so I just, - Yeah, no. White lie. So you saw Tim, then, all right, but you guys were like six feet apart and all that, right? Yeah. Good. For most of it we were. Hmm. Okay. I guess I could get tested. I feel like there's something you're not telling me here. I mean that's all the important information is that we've both been exposed and we should get tested. So that's the reality we're dealing with. No judgment. Purely a medical question here. But did anything physical happen while you guys were out together? Yeah, there were parts of it where we broke the social distancing rules, so. Right, I am just trying to get a better idea of what you're talking about. Well, you know, I'm not remembering all the details. I just know that we were in close proximity and that the particles were definitely being swapped. Leah, did you kiss this guy?- - Yes. - Oh my god. - I'm sorry - but we were broken up. - No, it's fine. - It's fine. - We were broken up and I - didn't think he had COVID. - Hey, hey, hey. He said he'd been self-quarantining. Okay, hey. Not the smartest thing to do during a worldwide pandemic - but, you know. - Yeah, super dumb, I know. We should both go get tested. Right. I'm definitely getting tested. Just again, they probably have you fill out a questionnaire about how you may have gotten it. I need to know these details. What do you wanna know? Did you have sex? Um... No. Um no, or no? I mean, we sort of did, we maybe did have sex but on another hand, maybe we didn't. I don't know what that means. Look, I feel horrible about exposing us, okay? But what's done is done, we were broken up. I'm not mad. We just happen to be living together and you may have brought a lethal virus into the home. So I wanted to just ask some simple questions. Second base? Yes, we also went to second base but none of the other bases are relevant. - The only one is making out. - Third base. We cannot get, COVID can't get transferred through sexual fluids, so it's not relevant. Third base? Oh my god, what the fuck!? You blew someone on quarantine?! He blew me, okay? And then I was like, oh I should probably leave because we're not in six feet distance. But honestly, that's a what, four feet distance? He blew you? We gave each other head. It wasn't like I just went over there to do that. - But I didn't know - What do you mean - you gave each other head? - I was exposed. Like a COVID 69? I don't even know if you can get COVID from eating someone out. Jesus Christ, please don't say that anymore. We were broken up, and, Oh my fucking god, - and we slept in the same bed! - I know, I know! - I'm sorry. - Oh! - What the fuck? - I have no excuse. I'm sorry. I was so done. And then you reel me back in. Look, I'm sorry. And now I have COVID. I've been responsible most of the time. I slipped up, - I deserve this. - Do you think you're - the responsible one here? - But I'm sorry. You don't think I know that you're hanging out with Hector all the time? Yeah, we're hanging out, we're not sucking each other's dicks. You never wear a mask, you don't give a shit about COVID. You were jealous of Tim and you don't like Tim and you're mad, - Okay? - Thanks for the - fucking favor - We were broken up. - And I didn't know! - and the COVID, you are a psychopath! Where are you going? I don't know. You have to know, it's a pandemic. You could have been exposed. You're missing the whole point of this conversation! No need to write on the test, okay? Roll up your window, pull forward. Ah. Ah. I don't have any symptoms. I feel good, honestly. So hopefully, you know, fingers crossed, I'm okay. And when do you find out about the results? They said about three days, so hopefully. So you may get it on your birthday. That's true. Birthday present. Yes, it'll be a positive one, I'm sure. I mean negative. Negative result, I mean negative result. Yeah, I hope so. And how's Nick? Nick? He moved out, so I don't know. He did? - Yeah. - Okay, well. That's what you wanted, so. Yeah. Take care, give me a call whenever you like and definitely let me know as soon as you find out. Okay, love you too. Bye, stay safe. Bye. You too, bye. I just can't believe you're negative. It's great. I know, I feel so lucky. You must have gotten it I guess after we hung out, I don't know. How are you feeling? I'm good. I mean I had a couple days there where I definitely felt like I got hit by a car - or something. - Oh, jeez. But yeah I mean now it's just sort of a dry cough but, Good, I'm glad you're feeling better. So are we still on for our Criterion night tonight? I was thinking there's this Godard film I haven't seen called La Chinoise about these radical Maoist students in 1960s Paris. It looks pretty good. Yeah, I mean that sounds super interesting. I hear a but coming in. Well, I'm just sort of in the mood for something totally mindless tonight. Like I'm so exhausted. You're sick, like don't you want to just maybe watch something dumb like there's this amazing reality show called Too Hot To Handle. It's super trashy. We can make fun of it, and like have some wine. That's right, I think I remember you telling me about that. I'm just doing this whole Criterion a day thing. I just wanna see that through to the end, so, probably gonna pass on the reality show. I mean it doesn't have to be a reality show. We could watch like a dumb comedy, like Biodome. Oh yeah, okay. I just like, value my time, so, I'm probably gonna pass on that if that's all right. Well do you mind if we raincheck then on the Maoist free radicals? Yeah, that's cool. Raincheck is good. I'm probably gonna watch La Chinoise though if that's all right. Yeah, go for it. I'm sure you have a lot of movies to catch up on. Since you were sick, you probably couldn't watch a movie a day when you were sick. Yeah, no, I did. Oh, okay. But yeah, I wanna continue, so that's the whole point, you know? Cool. I'm gonna, I gotta go, - so, okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. How's the studying going, Mr. Attorney? You know, it's going. Yeah? What you studying? Just ancient law stuff. Hammurabi's code. Hammurabi's code, I don't even know what that is. Well, I could tell you if you got a minute. No, I got something to tell you. What's up? I got booked. What do you mean? Yeah, I got booked for a TV show, a network TV show, bro. You did? Yes, with this lady called like Lorraine Dorne. Lorraine Dorne? Lorraine, Loren, like Loren Durn. Laura Dern?! Yes, so you know who that is, right? Yeah. That's crazy! Dude, she's like super famous. I've never heard of her. Um, Big Little Lies, Marriage Story, her dad is fucking royalty Bruce Dern? Yeah, something like that. It don't matter. Also Robert De Niro's gonna be part of the project. What? Isn't that crazy? What is the show? I'm not supposed to talk about it 'cause I signed the NDA. But we're shooting in 2021. It's gonna be dope, man, I'm super excited. I'm like, I don't know what to do, how to feel. - Wow. - Wow. We winning, right? That's crazy. And I know if you would have auditioned for this part, I know you would have gotten it. Nah, man. You deserve this, bro. Look at us! Look at us, man. We're both living our dreams, bro. You know, I'ma become a famous actor. And you studying to take a law test. We're living our dreams, dude. You know what it means it's like, it's important to work hard. And once you work hard, you get what you want. You know what I'm saying? A hundred percent. Yeah I'm gonna go inside. Me and Jeanine are gonna celebrate right now, gonna drink up. You know, do what we gotta do. Okay. You know? Yeah dude, get after it. ♪ Abimbuap ♪ Would you mind just bringing me just another poop bucket and some toilet paper? Gotcha. Because this one's overflowing. Why you pooping out here, you could just use the bathroom inside? Because you said I can't go inside! I said that? Oh shit, yeah my bad. Matter of fact, I'ma get you two buckets. - Wow. - I'm in a good mood today, - brother. - Hey. - We both won today. - I got you. All right, thanks. Hey, Nick. I'm just calling to say I'm negative, I tested negative. Hopefully you're okay. Hopefully you got tested too. Yeah, I just don't want that to be the way we have our last conversation. I would just love to talk to you. But please call me back. Okay, bye. If there's anyone here or anything here, I ask you to leave and I banish you with this sage. Ah jeez, shoot. There's no fucking ink? There's no ink. Come on! One pencil! Hey, Leah, it's Mom. Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. And let you know that we're super happy that your COVID test came out negative. And give me a call later today so we can talk. Love you. Bye, have a good birthday, I love you! Okay, I love you. Love you, everybody. Bye, - love you, happy birthday. - Thanks. Bye. Hey there. - Enjoy. - Thanks. - Got it? - Uh huh. Actually, slide it. Ah, perfect. Jesus Christ. Oh, shit. Hey man. Wow, small world. Yeah. Amazing, right, you're delivering food now, that's cool. Yup. Thanks for your service. Mhmm. Looks like you're feeling better. Yeah, I was pretty sick there for a few weeks, but right as rain now. Glad to hear it. Yeah, thanks for the concern. Yeah, you got it. - So, I got a few other- - Well hey man, look, I mean, since you're here, weirdly enough, I just wanted to, like apologize. Even though, I'm pretty sure I got COVID after I saw Leah, you know, I'm sorry to put you two through that. Well, I appreciate it, but it's really on Leah. She should be the one apologizing to both of us for creating this whole weird ass scenario, so, I don't know if I would say it's all on Leah. I think that might be a little unfair. No, dude, she was seeing two guys at once during a pandemic. A little manipulative. Yeah, I wouldn't use that word. As far as understand it, you were squatting at her place a couple of months after she broke up with you, so. And that's kind of on you in my mind. All right, I didn't- - I'm sorry, I'm not trying- - No, I didn't squat anywhere. Okay. I was living where I'd lived for years and, Sure. I just feel like it was a little bit unfair what you said and I just wanted to correct it, that's all. - That's all, yeah. - Okay. Dude, you weren't there. - Well I kinda was. - I dated her for four years, pretty sure that I've got a little better picture of what the situation was. You know, look, I don't know her as well as you do, that's true. But from where I'm standing, she was forced to live with an ex during a national emergency. Well I didn't force her to do anything if that's what you're implying. I didn't say that. Okay, but why are you trying to make me sound like I'm the manipulative one? I'm not making you sound like anything, man. If that's how you sound, then, Well look, I'm just trying to say I like Leah, man. I think she's a good person, I think she's a nice person. As evidenced by the fact that she didn't kick you out. Honestly, good thing no one ever asked you what you thought of this situation. Okay. I wish you a good night. Thank you. Thank you so much. Enjoy your noodles. Hi, I had a quick question for you about a face cream, a night cream? I don't know the brand name but it's in a purple bottle. And I got it in Japan about three years ago. Okay, well thank you anyway. Purple bottle Japanese cream. I believe it's hydrochloric acid or something along those lines? Hydrochloric acid? Or hyaluronic? Hyaluronic acid? Hyaluronic acid, yeah, that sounds right. Come on, come on, close. Who is this? This is Finley. Is this yours? - Yeah, I adopted him. - What? - Yeah. - Hi, buddy. All the shelters were closing.
