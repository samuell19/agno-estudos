Have you consumed this alcohol primarily whilst alone or in a social setting? Alone. Have you regained contact with family and friends since your release? Some. Have you been made aware of the various support programmes that are available to you since the commencement of your parole? Yes. Okay... I need you to sign down the bottom there. By signing this, you acknowledge that the information you have provided is true and accurate. Okay... Now there are a couple of other issues we need to discuss. I'm aware that you failed to attend a grief counselling session on the 25th... is there any particular reason why you didn't make that appointment? I had to work overtime that day. Okay... It's not compulsory for you to attend those sessions, but we recommend that you do. And given your loss, prior to your offending, I think it's wise that you continue with those sessions. And in the sense of making a positive case to the parole board, I think it's important that you stick to it. I wanted to go. I couldn't get away. Yeah, nah, nah, that's fine. In regards to your employment... Matt Evans called a couple of days ago... and he said that they're looking at downsizing at the factory. Which basically means they've had to let go of a few men. And since you're the least experienced on their roster, they've decided to let you go. Okay, now I know that the timing's not ideal... but the return to work scheme doesn't always guarantee you a job with the same employer after your release. So the shift that you did today was actually your last with them. Your final pay will come through sometime next week. How many people are they letting go? I don't know. He didn't say. I didn't ask. I just know that they let you go. Now... I had a read of some of Ian's handover notes from your meetings with him. And one of the things I took from that, is that you're keen to try something "different"... something other than the work that you're doing at the moment. Yeah. I know this is our first meeting... but I'm gonna be completely honest with you, Jack. Given the violent nature of your crime, and the length of your sentence... You did 3 years reduced from 6... Wounding with intent... Grievous bodily harm, assault with a deadly weapon. In a case that, without the compassion grounds, could have easily been ruled attempted murder. And we have to disclose all those details to any potential employers. So in the case of you actually getting the job that you want... the one that you spoke to Ian about... at least at this stage, where you're currently sitting in your parole, it's just not realistic. I'd like to try. I beg to differ on that one. They won't even look at you. If I show them your criminal history, you won't even have a chance. Okay... One of the conditions of your parole is that you have to be in employment so that we can monitor and facilitate and allow and... things like that. So, the most important thing right now, is for us to get you back into the workplace. Alright? Because once you have a job, you'll have a routine. You'll have a place to be. It will also give you that social contact that you need. Okay? I have some contacts... And I'm pretty confident I can get you something fairly quickly. It may take a couple of weeks, and it'll be shift work... so that's labouring, trades, that sort of stuff. You okay with that? - Yes. - Okay. Hi, Dad. It's me, um... Just, um... Sorry for... Sorry for calling, 'cause... I know it's late there and... I just wanted to let you know that I'm okay, and... I'm... out now, and I'm... working and... Hi... Barrett. Helen. Colford, yeah. Helen? Hi. It's Grace. Peterson. Yeah... How are you? Yeah, good, good. Yeah, um... I'm being released from Clearview tomorrow. And I'm going to be in Colford. I wanted to ask you... Would it be okay if I stayed at your place just for a couple of days? Yeah, I understand. Helen? Please. Yeah... Okay. Thanks... Yeah. Bye. Bye. - Someone coming to pick you up? - Mmhmm. Bye.

He's away. Will he come back? Ah... yeah, I think he's back on Monday. Do you know what time approximately, please? Umm... he's usually in around 8. I used to work at a supermarket. - Yeah... - Oh...

I don't blame you for what you did, you know. That drunk, he should've been locked up for what he did to her, leaving her on the road like that, suffering... Can I just get the fish?! He deserved to be locked up, Jack. He shouldn't have left her there on that road... suffering like that. He shouldn't have. Are you okay? Sorry. Why? The fish. It's really dry. And the sauce tastes... really weird. The beans are really nice. But the fish... it's bad, right? I really like the beans. And... yeah, the fish tastes kind of weird. But the beans are really nice. - But you like the beans? - I love the beans. I like you. David, it's Grace. I'd like to see Sean. David, please, I don't want to fight with you...
