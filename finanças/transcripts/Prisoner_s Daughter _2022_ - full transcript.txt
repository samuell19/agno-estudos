It's stage four pancreatic cancer. It's metastasized to your liver and your kidneys. You have a few options, but it'll just prolong life. - It's been pretty long already. What are we talking? Four, maybe five months. - I feel fine. The pain will come. - I'm used to pain. Yo, Max! Max! - So how'd it go? - I've been worse. - Well, you gonna get an operation or something? - Something. - You need anything? - I'm good. Mom. - Yeah. - This is not Frosted Flakes. The cereal is literally making my mouth burn. - Okay, I get it, the cereal sucks. Here. - Half? - I'm sorry, babe. We're gonna have to stretch 'em out, just for a little bit. We need better insurance. - Well, why don't you put all your complaints on paper and I will talk to management. - Wait, ask Dad for the money. - All right, I'll handle it. That new hot water heater didn't help, but I got extra shifts this week, so we'll be fine. - Well, if I have a seizure, it's your fault. - What? Hey, hey, hey. Stop that, I don't like that, that's not cool. Go, go, go. We're gonna be late. Excessive heat warning today, Las Vegas expects to see temperatures into the 105 to 110 range. Not only today, but also tomorrow. Pahrump Valley, 103 to 107 and Roseland, 110 to 117. So this is just the beginning. We do have a chance... ♪ Work it out, maybe we can work it out ♪ What's for my lunch? - I made my famous peanut butter and tiny bit of jelly. But I made it with love. - Mom. - What? - I'm not a baby anymore. - You're my baby. Your friends aren't even looking. - Those douchebags are not my friends. - Hey. Go on, get outta here, go be smart. - Love you, Mom. - Love you more. Yo, dickwad! Hey, twitcher! - I'm so sorry, sir. I'll get you one without cilantro. Hey, waitress, excuse me. - I'm gonna be right with you guys. Are you good for drinks right now? Your order's just- - Okay, thanks. - Okay, be right back. I didn't forget you. I'm getting your salsa. Maxine, veggie tacos, table eight. - And here's your extra cheddar. No such thing as too much cheese, right? - Warden wants to see you. - Now? - No. Christmas 2025. Let's go, boss. - Okay, I'm gonna refresh your water. - Hey, Maxie. Hey, hey, hey, you got a second? - What are you doing here? - What? - No how are you, nice to see you? You look great, babe. - What do you want? - I just need a sec, okay? I wouldn't be bothering you if it wasn't important. - You want money? Because I don't have any. - Jesus Christ, no, I don't need money. I need to see my son. - Okay, my manager just got back, so go. Go. - Look, why do you always do that? You always make me look like an asshole in front of everybody. Huh? I just need a sec. - Everything okay, Maxine? - Yeah, everything's fine. I'm just trying to talk to my wife. - Sorry, he's just leaving. - No, I am just leaving, Tom, just as soon as my wife here- - I'm not your wife. - Do I need to call the police? - No, no, no. - Call the police? What for, asshole? - Okay, sir, I'm gonna need you to leave. - You need me to leave? - What are you gonna do, huh? - Stop it! - What are you gonna do? - Somebody call 911. - Oh, call 911? Oh, no, oh, no, Tom. - Hey, hey, why don't you just go? You need to leave. - Okay, no problems, Tom. This is your fault. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - I wanna see him. - What a fuckin' asshole. - I know he is, I'm so sorry. Tom, I'm so sorry. - I gotta let you go. Sorry. - Oh, fuck. - You have any family, Max? - No. - I know you have a daughter. - Then why did you ask? - You know, you've done a lot in here with helping these guys get sober. I mean, you've been pretty good. I've already spoken to the parole board. Now, if your daughter is willing, you can live out the remainder of your days under house arrest. Well, I can make this happen pretty quick for you, but your daughter's gonna have to agree to it. - Well, I haven't spoken to my daughter in a long time. We're blood, not family. Not anymore, anyway. Hello? Hi, this is the principal's office. We're gonna need you to come pick up your son. - Fuck. - We have an issue. - Okay, I'm on my way. - He did have an altercation with a few boys at lunch today. - A few boys? - Yeah. The other boys have been suspended, but this will go on Ezra's record, and he will have detention through next week. - For what, getting beat up? - Sorry, my son got attacked and he's getting punished? - I'm sorry, these are the rules. - Well, your rules suck. You know he has epilepsy. What if he'd had a seizure? What would you do then? Expel him. - We can't make an exception just for one student. - Oh, this is such bullshit. Now he's gonna have a mark on his record for nothing. We have a strict policy against fighting. - He wasn't fighting. My son is an exceptional student who has had a really hard time because his mother has made some stupid mistakes. Not him, me. The rules state... - Your head is rammed so far up your bureaucratic ass, you can't see you're hurting an innocent kid? - Is this really the example that you want to set in front of Ezra? - Actually, yeah. Yeah, it is. Come on, let's go. - That was kind of cool, Mom. You should have walked away. - What... I did. - Well, you should've walked faster. - Well, are you mad at me? I didn't do anything! - No, but you could have done something to get yourself outta that situation. - Here you go. - Okay, that's very thoughtful. - You're welcome. - Go to your room. - I was planning on it. Wait, wait, wait. Could you get that, please? - Oh my God, up or down, make up your mind. Hello? - Hello. Is Maxine there? - Wait, who is it? - I don't know, they called you Maxine. - Hello? Hello. Maxine? - Yeah. It's Dad. How you been? Is that your boy? What do you want? Well, I just wanted to see how you're doing. - Bullshit, you want something, what is it? - I'm getting out soon. And I give a shit because? - Oh, maybe this was a bad idea. Yeah, you got that right. - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - I'm sick, Maxie. You there? - Yeah. You're sick. So what? - I don't have a lot of time left. And anyway, the warden has made me an offer. - Look, I don't have a lot of time to play catch up, so say what you wanna say. - In the time I have left, I would like to spend it with you. - Really? - Well, the warden says if you sign for me, I could spend my last days with you, outside of this place. Compassionate release. You still there? - You have the nerve to call me after 12 years to tell me that you wanna live with me? I just thought maybe... - Well, you thought wrong. Don't call here again. Okay, okay. Don't hang up, please. I'm sorry. - I'd just like to know one thing. What's his name? - Ezra. - That's a good name. I bet you're a great mother, Maxie. Maxie? - All right, I'm going to work. Call me if you need anything. Feel weird or something, okay? And no TV. I'm serious. - What? - Especially that Vegas crime show, okay? I don't want you watching that anymore. - Why? You afraid I'll see Dad? - Kiddo. I'll see you in the morning. - I mean, it's the only way I get to see him, right? - Come on, Vic. Let the lady do her job. - How'd it go tonight? - A mess. New girl couldn't even bevel 'cause of bunions and then face planted. - It happens, trust me. I've had quite a few crappy nights on that same stage myself. Hey, any extra shifts I could pick up? - Sorry, Maxie, not this week. Hey. Why don't you get that sexy ass of yours on the pole? Make yourself some serious money. - Why don't you get your ass on a pole? Get outta here. - Come on, Hammer. I don't want those fucking chemicals flying around inside me. - Oh, like you haven't put anything worse in your body than that? - Yeah, okay. - Hey, is it true? - Yes. I banged your sister. - Yarek says he owes you. Whatever you want. - A new pancreas. - Okay, I will ask him. - I'm kidding. Tell Yarek we're all good. - He wants to make sure. - Everything dies with me. - Thank you. I'm sorry, it's been declined. - Well, could you try it again? - Sure. Yeah, nothing, I'm sorry. - Okay, well, how much is it? - It's 171, please. - Look, is there any way that you could gimme some of it? Like say 20 bucks worth? It's for my son, he has epilepsy. - Yeah, you'd really have to talk to the pharmacist about that. Maxie. Look it. Hey, listen to me. That manager provoked me. - Okay, thanks. You got me fired. I need money, Tyler. - All right. 20. That's all I got. - You have money for some bullshit band, but not our son? - Well maybe if you let me see him, I might be a little more generous. - Here? You're squatting with a bunch of losers. - It's an artist co-op. - Oh, okay. Get yourself cleaned up and get a place with a real bedroom for Ezra, and then maybe I'll think about it. In the meantime, he's out of medication. - What medication? - I give up. - What? - He's antiseizure medication. For his epilepsy. - I know. Look, hey, hey, I got a gig coming up, okay? I can get you some cash then. - A gig? That's a joke, right? - I'm trying, babe. - Great job. I smell Father of the Year. Message came in from Admin. Call your daughter. - Hi, I got your message. - So that thing you asked me, I'll do it on one condition. You have money? - I've got some. - You pay me rent and you cover all your own expenses. Food, toilet paper, everything. - Maxine, is everything okay? - Do you want it or not? Every month on time for as long as... - Sure. - I already signed the papers, so you can be released today. - I appreciate this. - Don't make me regret it. - If you ever need me to take care of anything, your daughter, whatever, when I'm out, if I get out, I'll do it. - I appreciate it. Keep up with the steps. - One day at a time. I love you. Don't ever tell anyone said that. - Watch your step. - My God. You're still so beautiful. - I'm not interested in making you feel better before you die. I need cash, that's why I'm doing this. You're a tenant. That's it. As far as Ezra's concerned, you're my uncle or something. You can't tell him you're my father, okay? You do that, you're out. - Oh, come, Max. - No, I am dead serious. Don't test me on this. You have a 50 yard radius from the house. You take it off or you mess with it in any way, it's gonna go off, and we come get you, which means you'll be right back inside. - I understand the meaning of house arrest. - If you have a doctor's appointment, we need to know in advance. Don't make us come back here. He's all yours. - Been ages since I've seen this place. Hasn't changed much. - Well, it's a dump, filled with bad memories. - Not all bad. - How would you know? You missed everything. - I'm not that guy anymore. - Okay. If my ex didn't bury us in debt, I'd sell it. I'm upside down on it. - How did that happen? - I don't know. Maybe since you were in jail most of my life, I didn't have anybody giving me any fatherly advice. I have to pick up Ezra. You can take my room. - I can't do that. - Well, it's either that or the couch, and I'd like it if you spent as much time outta sight as possible, so. I'll sleep in Ezra's room. Shit. - How bad is it? - It's fine. Oh. This is my gate money, and whet I earned inside. I'll have more soon. - Okay, but I don't want you bringing your past in my house, and no drinking or drugs. - I havn't had a drink or touched a drug in 12 years. - Okay, I'll be back in an hour.

How come I've never heard of you? - Hey, don't be rude. - I'm serious. You've never mentioned Uncle Max before. - I've been away. - Like where? - Okay, ease up on the questions. Max is probably tired. - How'd you get that black eye? - Why don't you finish your pizza in your room? - I thought I'm not allowed to eat in my room. - Well, this is an exception. - Mom, a little consistency would be nice. Nice to meet you, Max. - You too, Ezra. Smart kid. - Too smart. - I know you're mad at me. - Okay, I'm not mad. I'd have to give a shit to be mad. - Don't you want to know anything? - What happened? - I know what happened. You're a criminal. You're violent. And I know you got paid to hurt people.

Stay in your room. - There you go. How's the cereal? - It's really good. - Less radioactive? I'm happy. Morning. - I have a question. - For me? - Mm-hmm. What was my grandfather like? - Ezra, Max just woke up. - Your grandfather? - Yeah. He died before I was born. Was he nice? - I'd say he was nice. Your grandfather had his share of problems. He did have a hard time showing his feelings. - All right. Come on, we're gonna be late. - Please, okay, Mom, are you PMSing? - Mister, you have three seconds- - I'm going, I'm going. Mom says I remind her of him sometimes. The good parts. That's why I asked. - The good parts, huh? - Yeah. That he used to make her laugh when she was a kid. Okay, see you, Max. - See ya. - Used to make you laugh. - Yeah, well, I had to tell him something. Look, I have to find a job today, so eat what you want. You can square up with me later. - You must be exhausted. - Hi, yeah, I'm calling about the... Administrative assistant position. I just, I can't see where to email my resume. The job requires at least two years of college. - Minimum two years of college? Just send your transcripts. - Yeah, of course. Ready to write this down? - Sure. You got a pen? - Yeah, I have a pen. - Okay, thank you, I'll email that right away. Great. - Hey, babe. - What? - Get that, will ya? - Hank's. - Is Hank there? - He's busy. - Tell him it's Max, he'll take it. - Some guy called Max on the phone? - Am I dreaming? - Another ball-buster, huh? - Well, you tell me. She's a pain in my ass, but she's good to me. How are you, my friend? When'd you get out? - I didn't really get out. - You escaped, didn't you? Holy shit! - Don't get too excited. - Max. Come by. - Listen. I'm not doing so good. - Yeah, well, we're getting old, buddy. - Look, that seed money I gave you 100 years ago for the gym. If you got it, I could use it. - Shit, Max. If I'd known sooner... It's pretty bad right now. Most of these fighters are training for free. Haven't had a contender in a while. - Say no more. I just thought I'd ask. I'm an asshole. I should have been putting something away, I know, but- - I gave you that money. You don't owe me shit. - Max, if it wasn't for you- - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Save it, save it. - I'll come by and say a proper hello. - Oh, I'm at the old house. Okay, I'll see you. - What's up, twitcher? Probably deaf as well. - Nope, I can hear you. - Oh! He speaks too. - And you walk upright. Amazing. Evolution. - Aren't you smart? - A little, yeah. It's too bad I can't say the same about you. - You want another beating? - I have a feeling that's a rhetorical question, but the answer would be no. - Oh. Guess you don't have a big mouth now, do you, twitcher? Yarek? The infamous Max MacLeary. Did you get Botox? - Fuck you, lots of men get it. - I told you, boy, we're good. - Max, relax, I just wanted to see you. - You know, our past dies with me. I just wanna make that crystal. - Of course. Max, you could have said a lot of things to make your life easier, but you didn't, and that kind of loyalty, that doesn't exist anymore, so anything you need, you just ask. - Actually. Your cousin still do construction? - Yeah. Really, that's what you want? All right, have a crew here tomorrow, make you a nice man cave. Mirrors, bar, the whole thing. - I have epilepsy. - That some kind of superpower? - Yeah. They call me the Twitcher. - Aren't you supposed to be in school? - That would be correct. This kid wants to kill me. - Did you know I was a boxer? - I didn't even know you existed until like a few days ago. - Come on. Is this the same kid that beat you up? - Same one. He's hated me since like first grade. And then he pulled a knife on me. What would you do? - What I would do and what you should do are two totally different things. - Seriously. - You fight him. - But he has a knife. - Trust me, he won't use it. How old is he? - 12, and trust me. Have you not seen the news lately? - Okay, okay. Stand up. Do me a favor, get your hands up. You always have to protect yourself. Chin down, hands up. Yeah, like that. And whenever the punch comes, your fists take the brunt of it. You might get clipped, but your hands are always, always up. That's good, good, good. You got it, you got it, you got it. Good, good, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Wow. Wow. I think I need a popsicle. - Shit, she's home. - Oh, you came home early? What happened? Are you okay? Did you have a... - You can say it, Mom. I didn't have a seizure. Just my stomach was hurting. - And what have you guys been up to? - Just talking. - Okay, go wash up before dinner. You didn't say anything to him, did you? - No. I'd like to, but since the kid thinks I'm dead, you know. - That's my fault? - He was just showing me the backyard, you know, the roses. They must be, God, 30 years old. I remember when your mother planted it. Yeah. You know... What are those? - It's a Rice Krispy treat. - Rice what? - Krispies. - Oh. - Yeah, try one. - No, I don't think so. - You know Max was a boxer? No, I mean, he was on the phone and he was saying- - Are you lying to me? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - It wasn't his fault. We got to talking. - Did he tell you he was one of the top amateur fighters in Nevada? - He was? No. - Go to my room. - Wait, am I grounded again? - No, goofy boy, my room. There's a photo album, third drawer. Hey. - I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, it's fine, I'm sorry. He came home, and he asks a lot of questions. - I know, it's nonstop with the questions. He can't just sit in silence, I guess. - Oh, he'd make a good lawyer. You know, you remember when you wanted to be a lawyer? Get me out of prison. - I was seven. - Oh yeah, but you were smart. - Aww, look at the baby. My first recital. - Wow. Cher. - Yeah. - Oh, you danced at Caesars? - Yeah, that was a short tour because I got pregnant with somebody who's sitting on this couch. Oh. I haven't seen this one before. - Give it back. - Did you know my grandma? - A little. - Mom never talks about her. Mom never talks about growing up. - Because there's nothing to talk about. Here. - When was this taken? - I think I'm gonna have to lie down. - Are you okay? Get my phone. Ezra! Call 911! You're okay. You're okay. - What's wrong with you? - Max is sick, Ezra. - Well yeah, I can see that. Calling the ambulance kind of gave it away. - I have cancer, pal. - Is he gonna die? - I'll let your grandfather explain his conditions. - He's my uncle. Sir, I think we should take you to the hospital to get checked out. - I'm dying. Nothing's gonna change that. - If you're concerned about this, we can just call your parole officer. - I am not going to the hospital. End of story. Thank you. Thank you. Much appreciated. - What is this? - Oh, that, that's my new PS5. - Seriously, what the hell is going on? Are you really dying? - Yes, I am. You do that? - Yeah, yeah. I'm feeling a bit better. Figured I'd take advantage of the good days. I've been thinking. Maybe I should go. - No, no, no. You don't have to do that. - It's just, you know, Ezra, you... - Max, I heard you throwing up in the bathroom. So gross! - Good morning. There's my son. - Give me a break, Mom, I'm 12. I don't understand half the stuff that comes outta my mouth. - Yeah, I don't buy that. Since the same kid corrected my grammar on a school note. - Who ends a sentence with a dangling modifier? It's pretty straightforward stuff. - Dangling what? - No, no, no. Don't ask, you'll be here all day. - Careful. It's hot. Thank you. - Okay. So listen, I have something to tell you. - That Max is your father? Which would make him my grandfather, who you told me was dead. I'd say you have something to tell me. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all of this. You sure you're an honor student? 'Cause I've explained it like four times. - Why did you lie to me? - It's complicated. - Can I use that same excuse next time you ask me if I'm lying? - No chance. - Is there anything else I need to know? Because if I ever do like a 23andme at some point. - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch where you're going, asshole! - Dad! - Ezra, stay in the car. - Oh, hey, boy, you good? - Yeah, I'm good! - Ah. Man. - I've missed you. - Come on, you're gonna be late. - Mom, five minutes, please. - Okay, you have until the bell. - Oh my God. Are you growing? You're so tall. Hey, Mr. Licorice. Hey, hey, hey. Check out what I found. It's my old band's t-shirt, man, isn't that sick? - It's amazing. - You want it? - Yeah, it's awesome. - You remember this, Maxine? - Come on, let's go, it's time. It's fine. - Hey, yo, I got you a 1964 Ludwig drum set. It's all set up at my house ready for you to come and stay with me. - Can I, Mom, please? - Yeah, we'll see. Okay, it's time go. - I'll get the second bell. Okay, when can I stay at your place? Come on, you can see your father another time. - It's fine. - Say goodbye. - Mom, I haven't seen him. - I'm gonna walk you in myself if you don't go now, okay? I'm not kidding. I'll hold your hand. - Yeah, she makes up the rules. You know this, all right? - Can't stop me from seeing him. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - I fought the law and... - The Lord won. - No, the law won, son. I love you, buddy. - Okay. Bye. - Go get in there, you genius. - You can't show up here like this. - Relax. Why do you always treat me like an asshole all the time? - Stop being an asshole all the time. A new drum set? - What? - You're high, Tyler. All this bullshit pretending you care about him, it's not about him. - I do care about him. - Well, if you care, then you'll get clean. - You can't stop me from seeing him. - No? Watch me. I'm not putting him through your bullshit again. - Max. - Took you long enough. - Between the broad and these pussy-ass fighters. - What the hell? You lost like 40 pounds? - 48, been sober five years, eating oatmeal. - Oh. Well, I know the world's going to hell if you're eating oatmeal. - Tell me about it. Look, best I could do. - I told you it was fine. - Oh, that's bullshit. I had to sell a few things, but here it is. I owe you, Max. - I can't take this. - Fuck you, take it. If I can scrape together some more, I will. - Thanks. - What's going on here? - I called in a favor from Yarek. - Ah, that's a name I could live without. - Oh, we're square. - Yeah. Look, I gotta go, teaching a boxing class with some old white women. I'm sorry about your, you know. - We're all going to die, Hank, even you. - Oh yeah. - No, not me. Uh-uh, never me. See you, Max. - See ya. - What the hell's going on? I come home, there's guys working. What do you think you're doing? - Oh, just fixing up a few things. - You should have asked me. - I wanted to surprise you. - Okay. Well, I'm surprised. - Hey, did I ever tell you why we called you Maxine? - Because you have a giant ego and you really wanted a boy. - No, no, it was your mother. We were young. We didn't know any better. But she said you were a natural born fighter from day one. - Look how far that got me. I asked you not to bring your shit here. - I'm not. I promised your mother years ago that I'd finish that little apartment, never did, I'm doing it now so you can rent it out. - Oh, now you wanna keep your promises to Mom? You're unbelievable. What's that? - This is for you. It's all I have to my name, and it's yours. - I don't want your dirty money. - It's good money. - Bullshit! Knowing you, somebody got hurt for that money. - It's clean. Stop being so stubborn and take it. I've also lined up a job interview for you. - You what? - A job, a real job. A friend of mine. He's got a bunch of businesses, I got you in. - Why? - Why? Why? Because you're my kid. It's the least I could do. - Okay, stop. - Oh, I'm a piece of shit, I know. - No, you don't get off that easy. Now you're trying to take responsibility? Now you wanna keep your promises to Mom? I had to sit in this house and watch her drink herself to death. - Your mother had problems. - Yeah, no shit she had problems. You didn't have to wake up at three in the morning to her screaming, lying on the kitchen floor, here. Right here. Drunk off her ass, knife in her hand. She was cutting her arms. She was too fucked up to even kill herself. And then when she saw me, she started screaming, "I hate you, I hate you. You've ruined my life." You didn't have to deal with that. I did. I would wait for her to pass out, drag her ass to bed, clean up the blood, and go to school hungry because she'd spent all her money on booze. I had to deal with that. And where were you? I'll tell you. You were off in Miami doing some messed up shit, or you were in prison. Mostly in prison. But I'll tell you where you weren't. You weren't here. - Maxie, please. - But I stayed right to the end, because that's what you do. So don't come in here now like you're some kind of fucking hero, 'cause you're not. - You have every reason to hate me. I'm sorry. I really, really don't know what to say. - Well, there's nothing to say. - I fucked up, I know. The shit I had to do to protect you guys. Stop, stop, I can't, please. - Maxie, please. I know, I know. None of this will make up for who I was or what I did. I know that. But you're my daughter, and what I should have done then, I didn't, and it kills me every day that I didn't. But please, Maxie. Please. I'm asking you. I'm begging you. Please, please, let me be your father for once. Please? Please? Look, there's nothing wrong with this money. Nothing. It's as clean as it'll get. And it's yours. Now you take it. You could use it for Ezra's college. - He's not gonna be anything like you. Or his father. Or me. - You're not so bad. - Hey, baby. - I'm not your fucking baby. - Will you tell me how many people are coming to your birthday? Because I have to preorder the pizza. - No idea. - You want anything special for your birthday? - Yeah. A set of balls. I'm tired of being picked on all the time. You don't get it, Mom. - What's to get? You're letting a bunch of idiots run your life. - 'Cause they can run my life. I mean, come on, Mom, look at you. Do you have a job? - I had two jobs, smart mouth. And I'm looking, so drop the attitude. - What, some minimum wage jobs? What do you do, clean costumes, work at Nachos Fully Loaded? - I'm not gonna apologize for that. We have food on the table. We have a roof over our heads. - You're three months behind on the mortgage. I can read, Mom. Really well, actually. - Since you read so well, read that. What does that say, hmm? That says all paid up. - It actually just says "Paid." - You're being a little shit right now. - I want to see my dad. - I know. I want that for you too, I do. Your father made his choices. - You kicked him out! You never gave him a chance! - I give him plenty of chances. You have no idea. He's not trustworthy. I'm sorry, Ezra. He's not careful with you. He does bad things. - Oh yeah, just like your father? No offense, Grandpa. - None taken. - Don't talk about your grandfather like that. - Why? He literally just got out of jail. - Kid's got a point. - Shut up. - You're such a hypocrite! - Hey, get back here, Ezra! I do everything for that kid. Everything. Tyler doesn't do shit, he never has. Ezra like worships him. - Let me talk to him. - Go away! Go away doesn't mean open the door. You're invading my privacy. - Take a breath, kid. Let me say something. You want the kid version or the man version? - Don't care. - All right. All right. I'll give you the kid version. - Give me the man version. - Your father, that you love so much, is a loser, plain and simple. He's a drug addict who cares about no one but himself. If he cared for you, he'd get clean, give money to your mother, come see you, and stop banging whores. - Wow. - I know you love him. He doesn't deserve your love. Trust me. I can write a book on shitty fathers. Your mother loves you. - A little too much. - Hmm, you should be so lucky. She works hard for you. - That kid from school almost beat me up again. - Oh, you look fine. - I'm scared, Max. I did call him a dickhead, though. - Let me guess. You feel it here. - Yeah, I'm shitting myself. - When did you start using those words? - Honestly, ever since you arrived. - So you're scared. Be scared. - Then what? - Then you fight 'em. I'm gonna take you somewhere. Show you how to really fight. - I wish I met you sooner. - Me too, kiddo. Me too. Listen. I want you to understand something while you're still young. If somebody offers you something all bright and shiny, and it seems too easy, it is. Look what happened to me. Go on. Apologize to your mother. She didn't deserve that. Hey. - You can't sleep on the floor. Take your bed. Hank had an extra futon. - It's not even finished. - Where I came from, this is the Four Seasons. I'm fine. Plus Ezra snores. - And farts. Good night. ♪ If you only love me when I'm out of control ♪ ♪ Easy come, easy go ♪ - Just don't be mad at me. You okay? - Yeah. - I'm not gonna be mad. I'm too tired to be mad. Come on, show me. What is that? Let's watch it. - No. - Let's watch it. Open it. I'm not gonna be mad. I was at that show. - Really? - Mm-hmm. He's pretty good. - He's amazing. He's so amazing. - Okay, slow down. - Can I ask you something? Uh-huh. - Why did you fall in love with him? - It was really weird. So I walked into this bar. He was on the stage playing, and I saw him and I just, it was weird, I knew I was gonna end up with him. And then I met him after and he was a total jackass, but it was a done deal. Plus that hair. - Yeah. - Yeah, Look at it. And I was an idiot too, so. - What's changed? - Hey! - I'm sorry. I can't help it, you make it easy. - Oh, I got my room back. So you're gonna have to do without this idiot. - Yay! - Oh my God, okay, your armpits smell like hamburgers again. - Hamburgers are good. You smell like cheese. - Not anymore. I was fired, remember? Go to bed. - Maxine? - Uh-huh. I mean, yeah, yes. - This way. We have three shifts, 24/7. We handle the laundry for all the major hotels. The Cosmo, Bellagio, Caesars. It will be general admin work at first, but once you learn the business, you'll move to payable and receivables. Starting salary's 42.5. - Sorry, how much? - I know it's not the greatest. Your desk is right over there. Health insurance as well. I know you have a boy, so I was told we have to work around your schedule. - Sorry, I'm a little confused. That's it? I'm hired? - You're in the door. But it's up to you to keep this job. You screw up, it's on you. You need to learn QuickTotals, and you start next week. Yeah, we're done. - Thank you. - You can go. - Oh. - I told you, he's a friend of mine. I can't leave because of this thing. Trust me, he knows what he's doing. - This the kid? - Yeah. My grandson. - Ah, he looks pretty tough. You sure he needs training? - Wouldn't hurt. - Hi. - Hey. - Don't go easy on him. - Do I ever go easy on 'em? - Hey. - Bye, Grandpa. My name's Ezra. - Good. You need a name. Yo, are you ready for this? - Do I have a choice? - Not really. Keep punching. Come on. Come on. There you go, keep punching. There you go. Oh, come on. Keep punching, there you go. There you go, there you go. Ho, there you go, ho, ho. Come on, come on, keep punching. Ha, ha, ha, come on. There you go, there you go. Punch it, come on. - Just give me a sec. - Don't stop, keep... - Just give me a sec. - You think this punk ass gonna give you a sec? - How is it gonna help me if he has a knife on me, huh? - Take that shit off. Okay. Here's what I want you to do, all right? You sure you got the balls for this, kid? Hmm? You got the balls, huh? - I think so. - Either you do or you don't. Now say it like you mean it. - I fucking do! - All right. You didn't have to swear, but okay. Now listen, when you see this punk ass, all right? You gotta be a little bit crazy 'cause people are scared of crazy folk, all right? Walk right up to him, grab him like this. Is that funny? Don't wince, don't wince. - I thought you were gonna hit me. - I know, I know, but don't wince. Gotta keep your eyes open, all right? Okay, now. It's your turn. When I tell you to come over, I want you to grab me by my shirt and punch right here. Don't let go of my shirt, okay? Be crazy! Okay, now really see this sucker. Visualize him. Okay kid, take his head off. You go there, there you go, keep punching. Keep punching. That's it, keep punching. - Oh my God, sorry. - Don't say sorry, okay? I'm going to teach you how to box. But now you got to be a fighter. - See you in the morning. Hey, what happened here? - It was just, Max was teaching me how to shave. - It's a little early for that, no? - It's cool, Mom, it's guy stuff. I could call in sick. - He's not gonna die tonight, Mom. - I know, I just... Thanks for today. - When do you start? - Next week. I got a lot to learn. - What's up? - Oh, your mom got a new day job. Through a friend of Max. A desk job. - Nice, Mom. - Yeah. Are you sure? Go. - You know lying is wrong, right? - I'm not the one with the ankle monitor. - Point taken. - I'm not five, you don't have to tuck me in. - I missed the last 12 years. Can I do some catching up, please? - Can we just watch one episode of "Vegas Crime Zone?" - Your mother said no TV. - She also said no fighting. You know, "break the cycle of violence" and all that. Didn't stop you from teaching me, did it? - She actually say "cycle of violence?" - Please, just one episode? - All right. Just the one. Let me use the can first. This is the police. Come out with your hands up. - Why did you go to jail? - Wow. You go straight for the jugular. - What, you're gonna die soon. I'm sorry. I look smart, but really I'm not. - Don't worry about it, it's all good. So, you wanna know why I went to prison. Which time? - Wait, how many times did you go to prison? - More than I care to remember. - Wow, okay. Well, let's start with the last time. And give me the man version. - I told you I was a boxer. Instead of fighting to my potential, being the best I could be... I took shortcuts. - What kind of shortcuts? - I made it easy for people to beat me for money. You understand? - You cheated. Well, what's that gotta do with you going to jail? - Give me a sec, I'm working up to it. You know, I didn't have much education. The skills that I had, well, you couldn't put it on a resume. - You beat people up for a living. - I worked for a couple of bad guys, and when things didn't go their way in business, they sent me to negotiate. Which is why I went to jail. - You spent the last 12 years in jail for negotiating. Yeah, that's not the man version. - Well, that's the only version you're getting. There are some things you don't ever need to know. I wish I could forget them myself. - You killed someone, didn't you? You know what, it's fine. I don't wanna know. You know, I saw my dad on this show once. - Sounds about right. - Fucking QuickTotals. Yes! Are you okay? - Not so good today. - Ez, breakfast. Listen, I was thinking, maybe you should consider treatment. That might give us some more time. - Yeah, well, I don't deserve any longer. - Okay. You might not, but we do. You think about it? - Ah, fuck it. You know it's gonna be 107 today? When did you last go swimming? - God, I don't remember. - Yeah, well, Yarek's out of town and said we we could use his pool today. Let's go. - Now? - Yeah, yeah. All of us. Ezra, you, me, let's have some fun! Hey, morning, slugger. What do you say? - Hey, kiddo. We're not going to school today. Really? - Yeah, it's too hot. We're going swimming. - Okay, this would qualify as a bad example, but I think you're awesome, Mom. Okay, I'm gonna get dressed. - You were gonna fight him today, weren't you? There's always tomorrow. - That's what I'm afraid of. Let's go.

How can I help you? - Hi. Yeah, I need to speak to the warden, please. One minute, please. Maxine, I have already heard about it. Now put the officer on the phone. - Could you just talk to him, please? I have him on the phone right now. - Hello? Put him on the phone. - Yes, sir, here he is. - Hello? Max, you got yourself in quite a situation there. - A little bit, but I'm not gonna lie. It was kind of worth it. - Mm-hmm. Well, this is the first and the last time. I don't have any more strings to pull for you, Max. - Right, right. Thank you. - Put the officer back on the phone. - Hello? - Let him go. Yes, sir. I got it. Oh, thank you.

Right this way. - Did Ezra's mom just call us assholes? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Slow down. Put that on. - Just don't be mad at him, okay? If it wasn't for Max, I'd probably spend the rest of my life running for cover. - Violence doesn't solve anything. - Well, I think today proved that wrong. Okay, I hear you. And I hated it, to be honest. I never wanna do it again. - Okay, but you're still grounded. And what kind of parent would I be if I didn't ground you? - After my birthday party? You know- - Okay. - I have friends coming. - Oh, you do? - And a girl. - A girl, tell me. - Okay. - Okay. It's ready. Keep your eyes closed. - Oh, I can't see a thing. - That's the point, okay? In you come. Okay. Now... Open. Yeah. You know, I called in a lot of favors over 20 years for this, best I could do. This is sick! - Yeah, yeah. You could get a great rent for this, you know. I would say, well, at least a grand. My God. - I'll get it. - Grandpa, it's amazing. Thanks. - Hey, hey, put that ice pack back on your hand. - Oh, don't be mad at him. - I hate to admit it, but I'm proud of him. - Yeah, I knocked him down. What? You knocked him down? That's awesome, kiddo. Max is showing me how to fight. - Max? Who's Max? - He's just my grandpa. Okay, wait, are you gonna come on Saturday? It's my birthday party. - What, you mean your mom's dad, Max? - Yeah, he's been living with us. Wait, Mom's coming. Okay, just try to come to my birthday party on Saturday. Okay, bye. Who was that? - It was Dad, okay, but Mom, before you freak out- - Did you tell him about Saturday? - I'm not gonna lie. Okay, I was gonna lie, but I did tell him, yes. - Okay, next time your father calls, just give me the damn phone. - I wanna see him, Mom. He's my dad. - I've got to get rid of that landline. - Maybe you should think about it. - Oh, don't you start. - Well, it's just, Ezra's a big boy. Try to make it work, that's all. - Big Daddy Bulldog's in town, huh? You think that's a good idea? - Actually, it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time. Do you think you can stop using for your son's birthday? - Maxie, I got it under control. - Okay, stop, stop. Can we just be real for a second? You're an addict, Tyler. - Do you think I want to be this way? - This is about Ezra, and he's gonna hate me if I don't let him see you. - What do you think's gonna happen? Huh? Just let me teach him how to play the drums, huh? It's the one goddamn thing I'm good at. It's the one thing. - I know. Just stop using for one day, okay? That's all I'm asking. - Oh, wow. - Hey, Grandpa. I was telling them how you used to beat people up for a living. You went to prison. - Somebody actually paid you to beat people up? How much? - What are you, a cop? Okay, who wants pizza? - Oh my gosh. Oh, oh. - You don't have to touch every slice. - I'm gonna lie down for a bit. Call me when it's cake. - Okay. - Is Grandpa okay? - Yeah, he just wants to lay down. Happy birthday, baby. - Hey! - Dad! - Bottom of the ninth, here comes raw daddy-oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, happy birthday, man. We got beer. Look at that baseball glove, huh? That's real leather, man. Okay, thanks, Dad. - What, okay, "okay, thanks, Dad." How you doing, Maxie, huh? - Can we speak for a second? - Hey, hey, buddy Mommy and Daddy need to talk. - Okay. - I asked you for one thing. You're not clean. - Look, I'm trying to be a part of my kid's life. Isn't that a good thing? - No, you've gotta go. - No, no, whoa, hey, wait. Will you quit breaking my balls? All right? I'm hanging with Ezra. It's the birthday party. Oh shit, yo, whoa, whoa, we got pepperoni. - Hey, hey, hey. - Whoa. Oh. - I got it. - No, no, I got it, I got it. I got it, I got it, chill, chill, chill, chill. Bro, I got it. - I got it. - No, that's what the ground's for. It's fine. - Come on, no party foul. No way. See? - Dad, stop. - Mm. Oh, come on, what? Come on, man, you want me to stay, don't you? Come on, tell your mom you want me to stay. - I do, but you're not... You just knocked over everything. - It was an accident. Was she brainwashing you, man? Did you tell my kid I'm the bad guy? - It's fine. - No, I'm his father! - It's fine. - I'm his father! - Stay, okay? It's fine. Stay here. - You're fuckin-A right I'm staying. It's a party. Fucking-A, right. I'm staying, I'm fucking staying, we're gonna have a party. - Okay, kids. Why don't we go into the front yard. - Come on, let's celebrate. Hey, hey. Gimme a beer. Gimme a beer. Where's the candles? Bring the cake! Don't be a fucking bitch! I'm trying to have a good fucking time, are you? - Maxie, everything okay? Great. Oh, look who just decided to show up and play daddy-o. - Well, you know about that, don't you? - Max, please, go inside. We're fine. - Yeah, yeah. You better get your old ass back inside. Hmm? - Look, you can see Ezra another time. - Oh, now you're trying to tell me when I can and can't see my son, is that it? What are you gonna do about it, tough guy? Huh? - Look at him. He's embarrassed. Be smart for once in your fucking life. - You better get your ass back inside before you get hurt. - I'm gonna ask you one last time. - Or what? - Tyler, you know me, you know I'm not a fucking around kind of guy. - Tyler! Dad! Stop it! Ezra! It's okay. Get away from him! All of you! Go! It's okay, baby. It's okay. I got you. It's okay. - Was that a birthday party or was that a birthday party? - Jesus Christ. This fucking family. - I get it, Mom. Dad's a drug addict. And a very angry man, by the way. - I don't know how you do it. You are an amazing kid. - How do you think? It's you. How's Grandpa? - I don't know. I should go check. - I love you, Mom. - I love you more. Ezra okay? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, Maxie. I lost it. - Yeah, story of your life. - He'll hurt that boy one day. You too. - That doesn't give you the right to beat the shit out of him right in front of Ezra. - I behaved like a pig. You deserve better. - Does the pig need a lift to his appointment tomorrow? - No, no, no, Hank's got me. Maxie. I just want to thank you for this. For all of it. Max, let's talk. - You were right about the pain. What do you think? Too late for treatment? Normally, I'd say yes, but you're a tough son of a bitch. - What kind of time am I looking at? It's hard to say. Maybe an extra month. Why don't you think about it, Max? At least let me write you a prescription for the pain. - Get that, would you? I'm brushing my teeth! - Is there any chance we won't be late one day? Probably not. - What are you gonna do, Maxie? - Stop it, Tyler! Stop! - Let me in. Let me fucking in! - Do me a favor. When I'm gone... - You're not gone yet. - When I'm gone, pop in from time to time, check up on them. Maybe hire Ezra part-time. - Okay. - How bad was I? - What do you mean? - I mean, how bad was I? The truth. My head's so fogged up, I don't know up from down anymore. So. - You were bad, Max. Ain't nobody around to tell how bad you were. I'm sorry, but you wanted the truth. - Maxie? Ezra? Maxie? Ezra? Tyler, you're scaring him. - You guys home? If you weren't such a selfish bitch! - Jesus. Tyler, think about what you're doing. - Maxie? Maxie? Tyler! - Maxie. - Tyler, please pick up. I promise I won't call the cops, just bring Ezra back. - Maxie. Where's Ezra? Oh, jeez. - I tried to fight him off. - This is my fault. And I promise you, I promise you, I will never, never let that piece of shit harm you again. Wait here. - I just want him back. Please, that's it. - When I send him out, drive. You hear me? Don't look back. Don't think, just drive. Give that kid the life he deserves. - I love you, Dad. - I love you too, Maxie. Never stopped. - We're gonna go camping, it's gonna be fucking great, man. It's gonna be me and you, bro. We're gonna be going down there. Gonna go down to fucking Tijuana, gonna be getting some fucking ladies. Me and you, man. - Where is he?! - Where's who? - Listen to me, you cunt! Where the fuck is he?! - Grandpa! - Don't you fucking touch him! - Ezra. What are you doing? I'm your dad, not him. - You okay? - Yeah. - Get over here! - Go. Your mother's waiting for you. Just go. - Promise me you won't hurt him. - I promise. - Get back! Ezra! - Come on, baby! Are you okay? Did he hurt you? - I'm fine, Mom, I'm fine. - You're a joke! - You come into my house, you take my boy! - And what are you gonna do about it, tough guy, huh? Here. Here. Pick it up, dickhead! Come on. Show me your fucking face! Bye! Fuck you. Get the fuck back. - My father wasn't the greatest guy. He wasn't the greatest father, either. We all know what he did. Maybe life never gave him a chance. Maybe he didn't want it. I don't know. But what I do know is I look out at all these faces I remember from when I was a kid. So he must have done some good, 'cause you're all here. I'm not gonna make excuses for him now that he's gone, and he wouldn't want that. This one time I was, I was really young, like eight or nine, and we were visiting him in prison. I spent a lot of time there. And this guard, he pointed me out to another guard and he said, "that's her?" They knew my dad. Who didn't? And this guard said, I'll never forget it. He said, "that's his daughter?" And it was so weird, because... It was like a guy that bad, that mean, could possibly be my father. And then they brought Max out. And he lit up like a kid on Christmas when he saw me. He always did. And yeah, I'm his daughter.
