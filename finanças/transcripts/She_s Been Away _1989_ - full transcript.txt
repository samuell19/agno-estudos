# ..Walking on air. # The why and the wherefore is someone I care for. # I'm yelling, # I'm telling folks everywhere, # I know that she loves me, # So what do I care? # I'm singing, I'm singing, # All the day long. # The reason is simple, # Two eyes and a dimple. # I'm cheery, # My dearie answered my song, # She said that she loves me, # How can I go wrong? # There's a rainbow round my shoulder, # And a sky of blue above, # Oh, the sun shines bright, The world's all right, cos I'm in love. # There's a rainbow round my... ..rainbow round my... ..rainbow round my... # Should I take the chair? Don't know if she needs it. It may not be the thing to do. How do I know what the thing to do is? This can't be the right place, can it? Of course it is. How could I come to the wrong place? I've been here before. ↑ There's no easy way of doing this. No rules. You can't get it wrong OR right. You don't collect someone every day who's been shut up... Don't expect reactions. She's a very docile, passive creature now. She could have got out long ago. My mother wouldn't try to get her out. My mother's dead now. Don't expect her to respond. She doesn't really understand what's going on. This was meant to keep them out of the builders' way, but some of us get through, don't we (?) You seem to be knocking the place down around them. We've a deadline to meet - had to start on this wing. All of these will be leaving in the next three months. That's George. He used to spend a lot of time with your aunt once. Those are all belongings of people who've died here over the years. We're trying to encourage these to take some. Isn't it odd what some people keep? Don't break anything! I remember the fish... ..from the last time. We tried to brighten the place up. But we lost interest when we knew the building was going. She won't remember your last visit. I know. She doesn't remember anything. But she's very easy. She likes doing her own cooking - a new development ten years ago. Things like sausage and scrambled egg. Remember, she's been in institutions for 60 years. There's not much left. Of course, I meant to do it gradually - tea...trips...weekends... But with you closing her ward... Yes, yes. Wouldn't have made any difference. Good! < Well, she's all yours. Take care of her. Don't let her out of the house on her own - that sort of thing. Got everything now, Lillian? We packed, didn't we? Come on, Lillian, you're not really asleep, are you? This is the day we've been waiting for. Aunt Lillian, we've come to...take you home. You remember me? I'm Hugh. Margaret's son. I've been before... She doesn't remember. They told us. Is he here to clean? I'll move, if he's here to clean. Don't be silly! It's your big day today. Say goodbye to your seat, Lillian. This is where she's spent years, just sitting, staring at the wall. Quite happy if she can do that. It's not the best view! (Jesus, what a dump!) We're going the wrong way. This way's not right! I've told you for weeks - you're going outside. I want to walk. Let me walk. WORKMEN DRILLING You don't know where you're going, do you? When were you last outside? When you were outside the home? She hasn't been out for a long time. We know that. The doctor said. Yes, but I want to know how long. STOP ! Stop it! Stop at once! STOP! It's all right, Lillian. Calm down. Tell me slowly - what have you lost? Well, the apple is here. That's not it, is it? Your hat? A tin plate? Not that? Your greeting cards? This old picture-book? That's not it? Ah-h...! Oh, that's what it was! Those tongs. Well, hold on to them now. Everything OK? CAR HORNS HOOTING Have we got lost? This doesn't look right. We're going round in circles, Hugh. This is it, Lillian. We're home. Do you recognise this street? Do you remember these houses? There's the family house. It's still the same one you were brought up in. The lions. Remember the lions? Leave her alone. I don't know why you brought me here. I'll be late back, and get into trouble over it. This is Dominic, my son. Louise, who looks after him. Teresa. Lillian, where are you going? Things have changed, of course, but there's still a lot the same. Your rooms are in the conversion. This is all wrong. You've brought me to the wrong place. Bathroom... What estate agents call a "luxury kitchen". Small, but it's got everything. Food in the fridge. And there's the garden. About 70 by 30. They've built this frightful school since you were here. But you don't need to see it. You can sit out. When do you come in to clean? I told you - I don't clean. If you want it cleaned... I think it's spotless. Take the flowers. I'm not allowed any flowers. You're here now. This is home. There are no rules. I'm not allowed two pillows. These are breakable. I'm not allowed them. Take them away. How much time is there left now? Time till when? Time till you have to switch off all the lights, of course! CLOCK CHIMING WHIRRING We were told this would happen. Take no notice. She'll come when she's ready. We must leave her alone. There's a terrible smell. Can't YOU smell it? It's horrible! It's disgusting! You always state the obvious. Keep quiet! If she sets the house on fire, will they blame you? Are we insured for any damage she does? RHYTHMIC CLANGING Do you hear that? Of course I hear that. It's Lillian, naturally. The whole street must hear her. They'll think we've got a trapped animal in the house, or something. It's OK. The first night was always going to be difficult. It's NOT "OK". I don't want her breaking anything down there. I couldn't just put her straight in another home. I feel very strongly about that. Don't you? She IS family, after all. Aunt Sarah will have her next year, when she's converted her basement. INCESSANT CLANGING TUNELESS SINGING I haven't drawn on a blackboard for some time. Now, Lillian, this is grandfather Edwin, sitting up here. He had two children. One was Gerald. Your father. He married Letticia, your mother. Can you see that? I've underlined them in red. Can you see that? They had eight children. Yes, eight. You were fifth, my mother third. Can you remember your sister Margaret, my mother? Do you have any feelings about her? Can you pick out the photo of you as a young girl? You don't remember anything, do you? Do you like to be called Lillian or Lilly? They used to call you Lilly as a young girl, didn't they? Lilly. Can I go to my room now? I'm not allowed out this long. You can do whatever you like now. And there's no pot under the bed. It's been forgotten. I'll see to it. She doesn't remember anything. They were right. We know that! And stop drawing her diagrams. She hasn't come here to be made to work, have you? Everything's fine. Spanking order. > You took your time! Get lost(?) We have to be thorough, naturally, when...em... When the mother-to-be is as ancient as this one(?) No, you have plenty of time to have at least four more. Terrifying thought! Everything all right at home? Not rushing about? Everything's fine. We have a crazy aunt of Hugh's staying with us. She lies awake every night, banging a tin plate and whining. Relatives come in all shapes and sizes, don't they? Always happening. How has your husband taken the news of the baby coming? Is he pleased? He doesn't know. Doesn't know?! Why? He doesn't need to know, does he? What's going on? What's all this about? Did you see who did this? They told me not to touch. TELEPHONE RINGS Yes? 'Am I right? I guessed right, didn't I? It's true, isn't it?' Guessed what? 'You're having a baby. You've done it, darling!' How on earth did you know? I guessed from the number of times you went to the doctor. Did you follow me?! I don't need to do that. What if I'd got Aids, or something? AIDS! 'Don't joke about that, Harriet.' It's not like you. I've got to go. Congratulations, my love! Our long wait is over. I was right. I knew I was! I was right! Get some glasses. WE'RE GOING TO CELEBRATE! RADIO: 'Mystery Voice time now. Listen carefully. This is not easy! AMERICAN ACCENT: 'I don't live in the old days. I live in the present and future. 'I love doing dramatic things...' Bing Crosby? Fred Astaire? Crooner. Do YOU recognise it? RADIO DJ: 'So, who was that? Any ideas? 'You know the number. Race to your phones. It's not obvious! 'Meanwhile, here's...' I used to be an actress. A part-time, tiny-role actress. Before I met Hugh. Would you have believed that? I played the bitch that gets killed off in Act One. Typecasting(!) Do you HAVE to sit here, of all places?! You don't have to sit HERE, in the middle of everybody! It's dumb, putting yourself there! What's interesting about that wall, anyway?! We're having a party, apparently. Quite a big one. Celebrating... something or other. I have to do the shopping. Hugh has made a list - surprise, surprise(!) You don't want to come, do you? You haven't been out since you got here. I think you'd better come. Was that a nod? A tiny hint of a nod? Was it? Can you understand what I'm saying? I don't think I'm allowed to be here. I'll get into trouble. You can't get into trouble. Relax. Lillian! LILLIAN! Have I got room? Have I got enough ROOM? Was that a nod?! SCRAPING OF METAL Oh, to hell with it! This is Hugh's car. I shouldn't be using it for shopping. I'm not even going to look! Come on! Hugh's lists always follow the layout of the shop exactly. "Start at the cheese counter, and move in a clockwise direction." Clockwise? Where's the cheese? Ah! I hope you won't find this party an ordeal, Lillian - all family. TANNOY: 'This is a customer announcement. 'Today's special offer is baked beans at 27p a can. 'And win a Caribbean holiday in our competition.' Two pounds of chevre... Two pounds of peppered brie... Two pounds of ordinary brie... You don't want these, do you? They must have fallen in, somehow. That'll be £122.50 please, love. SIREN STARTS Lillian? Wait! She's with me! Wait! WHY must I buy it? I'll put it back. The meat's begun to defrost? That's rubbish! It's because we've been standing here for 20 minutes. The BISCUITS haven't defrosted! I don't believe it! I just don't believe it! Why didn't you TELL me, you idiot?! You WATCHED, did you? Hugh will KILL me! This is the last time we go shopping. Do you HEAR? DO YOU UNDERSTAND? GUEST: Are you sure this is the right house? - Is SHE going to be there? - Yes, I believe she is. - What, for all of it? HUM OF VOICES I hope you're all going to gorge yourselves. There isn't much choice, so decisions are easy. We'll give you all a bag to take some home - a "ducky bag"! That makes a change! < It's a sort of subterranean restaurant... Hello, Lillian. ..food from Madagascar, or New Guinea, or somewhere. < That new development by Liverpool Street Station... Hello, Dominic. We were... ..talking about house prices. It's one of my best subjects. < I've guessed the Wimbledon winner for the last seven years. You're going to eat something, aren't you, Lillian? Those ducks! She chose most of it. Have a drink! Celebrate! Really enjoy yourself! These people are here to meet you. < You don't remember me, do you? I'm Matilda. Remember? You stayed with me one summer... ..when I was a girl. We quarrelled the whole time! She doesn't remember. Don't you understand? She can't even remember who she is, poor dear! Questions are pointless. She's just like a gentle vegetable, shut away all that time. I came to visit you, once. You look just the same now as you did then. Isn't that nice? I must just get myself some duck... I have to keep going to the doctor. Is it because you've got Aids? If you keep going to the doctor, it could be Aids. Whatever they've done to you, it certainly hasn't worked! GHOSTLY MUSIC # I'm happy, so happy, Walking on air... # I'm yelling, I'm telling... # Edward, tell your brother to go away. Yes... Go away, Thomas. Read this later. You won't be able to sleep! # There's a rainbow round my shoulder, and a sky of blue above, # The sun shines bright, the world's all right, cos I'm in love! # There's a rainbow round my shoulder, it fits me like a glove, # Let it blow and storm... # Edward, Edward! Go away, Colin. Somebody trod on it in the garden. I thought you'd like to see it. # I'm singing, I'm singing All the day long, # The reason is simple, # Two eyes and a dimple. # I'm cheery, My dearie answered my song, # She said that she loves me... ..she loves me... ..she loves me... # Why didn't you come down to dinner? What on earth are you DOING in here, Lillian? Nothing. Enjoying myself. Reminding myself what you really look like. Now, everybody, pay attention! Ready for the picture. Edward! Look at me! Please just look at me! I'm not going to go away! I'm going to MAKE you look at me! EDWARD! LOOK AT ME NOW! Why are you DOING this to me? Edward! EDWARD! EDWARD!! You're not going to go, are you? You're not really going to go? Edward! You're not going, are you? Edward! Don't go! Don't go! Stay here! Stay with me! Edward! Edward...stay! STAY HERE, EDWARD! Harriet wanted it open, but I got the CV. It's a...highly-strung car. I think it was the older one. I'm not sure. I can't remember which was the one I liked. I don't remember. I can't tell them apart now, anyway. What, dear? You don't know which is your glass? Just take another. That's what we do. You're allowed to drink all this, are you? # ..Walking on air... ..walking on air... ..walking on air... # They think this is where I belong still. Nobody knows what to do with me. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. We are here on this happy occasion for three reasons. < Only three? Apart from seeing all of you! The first - this is Harriet and mine...this is our tenth wedding anniversary. This very day! < Many more! Second - to welcome my Aunt Lillian back. Her return from... from a long time away. An unnecessarily long time. And thirdly - we mustn't forget thirdly, because there's a little bulge down here. Yes, we're having another baby, at last! CHEERS AND CLAPPING "Grapes of Wrath"? "Gorilla in the Mist". > "Closely Observed Trains"? > "Born Free"? ↑ "The Cow". It's Iranian. < "Jaws III"? 30 seconds. MATILDA: She seems very peaceful. Almost happy, I'd think. You wouldn't know anything by just looking at her. And to think of what she did! I used to say she had a skin missing. She felt everything so extremely. > MATILDA: Part of her brain missing, I'd say! Yes...! Er...grass. < "The Grass is Greener"? "Splendour in the Grass". That was good, that hippy. That was especially funny. OK, darling. The dope-smoking was gruesome! Almost professional. She can still act when she wants something! Well done, darling! Why doesn't Lillian have a go? Lillian's turn! No, no, I think we've had enough. Game's over. Let's go next door. # There's a rainbow round my shoulder, There's a sky of blue above, # Oh, the sun shines bright, So I'm all right, Cos I'm in love. # There's a rainbow round my shoulder, And it fits me like a glove, # Oh, the sun shines bright, So I'm all right, Cos I'm in love. # That was very nice, Lillian. Excellent! Aren't people pigs? Look at this mess! Haven't got very far, have you? Maybe we can use some of it again. Might be able to salvage it. Be a pity to waste it all. Oh, you haven't been smoking again, Harriet?! Hardly. Are these yours? It looks like you. You KNOW you shouldn't do it, and you still go ahead. It's AMAZING obstinacy! I'm going to keep these as a reminder. I'll hang them up in the bedroom. I am! Now hurry up. It's extremely late. You don't want to be up too late, darling, do you? DOOR CLOSES What are you looking like that for? Aren't you going to help? Sorry, I didn't mean that. Yes, maybe I DID mean that, cos you don't fool me, Lillian. You haven't fooled me from the start. You know far more about what's going on than you pretend. You understand everything, don't you? But you prefer to seem an idiot. I know you don't like me. But I want you to know... I've seen through you. D'you understand, my dear? You're a fraud, Lillian. Quite a good one, but a fraud. Aren't you? Give a little nod, go on! It's OK. I don't mind. No-one else need ever know. You look terrible, Mummy. You look like you're going to be sick. ARE you going to be sick? Dominic, please...! How did I produce such a crude specimen? Where did you come from? I don't know! Not more! Don't have any more, please! Take it away, Teresa. Teresa, put it down! At once! Nobody listens to me at all! You're always cross with me - d'you know that, Mummy? It's 160 days since you last said something nice. That all(?) I'd no idea we got on so well. It's 200 days since you said something nice...and meant it. I bet you've been counting the days till I go back to school. Right! I cross them off each day. It's a huge relief when the end's in sight. For me, too. Darling! I hate it when you go back. You know that. Where's the smell? The awful fishy smell Lillian makes. Where is it? Mrs Ambrose, Lillian went. Went?! She said she had to do it. She had to leave. About ten minutes ago. Didn't I tell you? I meant to. She just went out of the house. Didn't even say goodbye. Can't blame her, really. She can't go out on her own! Don't you see? She can't even cross the road! Louise, ring Mr Ambrose. Tell him to get back here right now. No excuses - get him here now! I'll just... Have you seen an old lady? No. We're going to school. She can't have gone far. I'm just... You've been keeping an eye out. Have you seen an old lady? I only look at vehicles. Great(!) Have you seen an old lady? About this height? Looking lost? Have you seen her? What are you STARING at? Have you SEEN her? If you do, call the police, OK? Understand? LILLIAN! I'm sorry! Er... Have you seen an old woman just go by? Oh, forget it! Has anybody seen a little old lady, in a daze, just wandering about? DON'T LAUGH! It's a simple question - have you seen anybody? Jesus! What a wretched collection of people! Is Lillian here? Lillian Huckle? Has she come back? She might have come back. I don't deal with the patients. Oh! LILLIAN! LILLIAN! Thank God you're here, Lillian! We were so worried. DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN! Leave without telling anybody. DO YOU HEAR? We didn't know what had happened to you! What's the matter? Why are you shouting? Why is she shouting? Do YOU know? They came back as well, did they? None of you can keep away. No. They've been drifting back over the past few days. When one leaves, another comes back. I'm glad you've come for her. I wish they all had someone. Lillian KNOWS she shouldn't be here. She'll come, don't worry. Won't you, Lillian? Just let go! Come on now, love. Please, Lillian. You can't stay here. Your ward has gone. I know you understand. She understands more than we know. We can't have her back. Do you hear that, Lillian? We don't want to have to use force. This is the place I want to be. I'm sorry about what happened last night. I didn't mean it, OK? Is that what you want to hear? Is that what this is about? I was drunk, I was really pissed, and I'm saying I'm sorry, OK? How did she get here, anyway? By taxi. By taxi?! I knew you could get around if you wanted! What about the address? I'd love to have heard you giving directions to the cabbie! That's clever! She didn't pay, though. We had to. It was over £70. I'll take your friend, too. We'll give him a lift home. I'll take you both out to tea, if you like. I escaped twice, I did. Under the river there's a pipe. I'd known about it for a long time. My God, if people knew what went on there, who I'd seen going through that pipe! Faces you'd know. Household names. Before, I used to see them going down to the river. I kept on trying to get away after that, but they were always watching me. I used to get the pillow. That's the punishment they gave us. I said, "I'll tell the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill." He was Prime Minister then. I wrote 25 letters. I remember the letters. They didn't work. They didn't post 'em, because they thought I was DANGEROUS. You know what they did with that pillow? Held it over your mouth till you were purple, couldn't breathe. Kicking, fighting, tearing away with your hands, but they kept it right there. We both got it, didn't we? They used to sit on me. Two or three used to sit on me when I got the pillow. > The extraordinary thing is, they were so terribly BAD at everything they did. They couldn't even do THAT properly. Amateurs! They were hopeless! So HOPELESS! Don't shout. Eat your ice cream. Don't shout, don't shout, don't shout, don't shout, don't shout, don't shout, don't shout, don't SHOUT, don't SHOUT! Keep your voice down, just a little. And after the pillow... SING-SONG: Get it in the morning, get it in the evening... Get it! Get it! BOTH: Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! (Eat your ice cream.) THEY FALL SILENT Thank you. Almost as good as your song at the party. Know any more? You're having a baby, aren't you? How d'you know that? SHE told you, did she? She won't talk to ME. Been gossiping about me, have you? Does he have to stay here? It's worse than that home. I can only deal with one of you. OK? Is that a terrible thing to say? No. Anyway, it's true. What on earth's he doing? Not going on about the baby, is he? Jesus! He'll get us all arrested doing that. Amazing sight, isn't it, that image? It's beautiful! He looks just like you. How d'you know it's a "he"? ↑ We don't normally specify the sex at this stage, unless we get a good shot of the... Relevant area. Naturally. ↑ I understand you being cautious. If people painted the baby's room pink, and then it was a boy, or painted it blue, and then it was a girl, they might sue you. Dominic, stop handing out legal advice. Just be quiet! (She's doing everything right, is she? (I've brought a list of a typical few days' meals. (My wife can be...how can I say?) Be with you in a moment, darling. (My wife can be a tiny bit scatty, so I wish you'd tell me if everything's been done properly.) It looks fine. Excellent. She's in splendid condition. Isn't it marvellous? I'm so pleased YOU'RE so happy, my love. # I'm happy, so happy, All the day long, # The why and the wherefore is someone I care for... # BLEEPS AND CRACKLES OF COMPUTER GAME DOMINIC: Gotcha! That makes 20. Everything all right, my love? Everything's thrilling over here. Lillian and I are having an interesting talk(!) QUIETLY: I mustn't panic. I mustn't panic. I mustn't panic. I mustn't panic. I mustn't panic. What, love? Nothing. Just talking nonsense to myself. Some kind of list, was it, darling? A list you were making? That's right. (I don't want Lillian to hear this, but Edward has died. (Lillian was very close to him once. (I'm sure she doesn't remember, but just in case, we'll have to break it gently to her.) VICAR: We therefore commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. It's quite frightening seeing the whole family in black. BURIAL SERVICE CONTINUES I hate funerals. Who'll be next? Poor Lillian! She obviously doesn't remember him. < She clearly doesn't realise what's happening at all. I'm glad that this has happened. It's much less confusing now there's only one of them left. Help me get away from this, dear, as quickly as possible. May our next meeting be happier. Invite me to see the baby. Gladys, you'll be among the very first visitors, won't she, darling? That's a promise! AEROPLANE DRONES OVERHEAD REPETITIVE POP INSTRUMENTAL I don't know why I feel so good. Funerals shouldn't make one, I know. It's perverse. Doesn't Gladys look incredibly young still? She must be over 80. Probably because she's never had worries. Does that apply to me? I'd hate it if somebody was saying the same thing about me. I don't think it's true. It's been bloody in the City this winter. Trench warfare! SHE SWITCHES OFF MUSIC You're always so clean, Hugh. Am I? You're an above-average washer, no question. Was the music annoying you? I'm sorry, love. Don't know why I'm full of energy. It's YOU that's meant to have a burst of energy when it gets close. It's not for two months. It's been such a warm winter. Maybe that's something to do with it. That reminds me - silly time to mention it - don't you think we overheat the house? I keep switching off radiators. Watch out for that, darling, OK? It's so lovely and mild just now. There's a woman in our antenatal class who's decided she doesn't want the baby. How extraordinary! What did her husband say? She didn't say anything. Started giving him these little cuffs. Cuffs? What d'you mean? Like this. OK, OK, I get the idea. Always the actress! I get the idea, Harriet. Nothing wrong, is there? Wrong? What could be wrong? Don't want to see the doctor or anything? No! Fine. Splendid! Funny how funerals always make you appreciate what you've got. That's right. Where are the cases? Where the HELL has he put all the cases? WHERE ARE THE BLOODY SUITCASES? Louise! Teresa! Where IS everybody?! TELEPHONE RINGS Don't answer that! TELEPHONE RINGS Don't dare answer that, Lillian. It's Hugh, I know. TELEPHONE RINGS If he mentions...if he mentions the car just ONCE...! I warn you. RECORDED MESSAGE: 'Hello, darling. This is Hugh, of course. 'Where are you? Are you in the bathroom? Why didn't you answer the phone? 'You must remember to check if the volume on the ringer has been turned down. 'There's a knob on the phone - do you see it? - marked "ringer". Check it now, darling. That's right. 'I'll be dropping by later this afternoon because today the car has to be serviced. 'Since no-one else can take it...' He mentioned the car. Did you hear that? He mentioned the car. Right! H-Harriet! I'm just popping out, just for a moment. I-I think I could pop out, too. Be n-nice to pop out. I'm only going round the block. To the shops. I'll pop out to the shops, too. I'm not going far, you'll see. SCRAPING OF METAL You know, Lillian, I think that chicken was THE most hideous thing in the shop. I wanted the chicken. It was the only thing I wanted. Didn't people bring you things like that in the loony bin? They only brought me apples. Lots of apples. What's it to be? Once more round the block? Was that a nod?! I wish your nods would get bigger. You're capable of saying yes. Once more round the block? Yes! What do you think of our little spin, Lillian? Could have a picnic if we wanted. I haven't the slightest idea where we are. Isn't that wonderful? I want you to see that the country hasn't all been swallowed up while you were in the bin. I suppose last time you were here boys wore boaters and drove round in jalopies making honking noises. All country lanes... Why are you poking me, Lillian? There's a nice little light just come on. A red light, see? Does it matter? Jesus Christ, the bloody petrol! Got to get off this road, or we'll be smashed up by juggernauts. Where the hell is there a bloody turn-off? Come on, don't run out! Get us somewhere, OK? LOUD HONKING It's typical of Hugh! He never fills the car up. He's too mean. He believes the last two litres are unnecessary, or some shit! Christ! BIRD TWITTERS The car's stopped, Lillian. We're out of gas. We're here for the night. You want me to SLEEP here?! Yes. I'm in no condition to go running round the countryside with petrol cans. YOU can, if you like. If we ARE here for the night, do me a big favour. DON'T bang tin plates! You can have one night off, can't you? OK? Lillian, don't do that! You must behave yourself. There's no room for anything else. Please! It's not MY fault we're here. I'm not meant to sleep outside. I don't care if you're not meant to. It's not allowed. It's forbidden. You're not in the home now, and this is what happens now, OK? I'm going to have a cigarette now, too. If that's acting, it's BAD acting. I know I shouldn't, but I deserve one. And we can feast on chocolates. There's nothing else to eat here. Louise? Teresa? What's the matter? LOUISE: We found the place in a mess. Something terrible's happened. What d'you mean? Where's Harriet? Mrs Ambrose and Miss Lillian are not here. Not here? Did you call the police? We must call them at once. Put that down. Leave everything as you found it. They took Lillian as well. Jesus! Can I have the police, please? BIRDS SINGING Aarghh! Lillian... we've got to get out of here. Come on, out, out! Who are those natives? Natives(!) Kids living rough between motorways. The wildlife of the area. That's all I need. About to get murdered, and look what happens! Come on, Lillian. Let's get out of here. Plenty of chocolates in the car. They're all yours. And the car, for that matter. If we're hitching, I must change. Lovely spot, isn't it? It's nice here. We know YOU'RE fond of staring at blank walls! When does it work? What? When does that work? I don't know. All the time. It's telephones, listening things, God knows. Got one! Well, come on! Not much, I know, but girls like us can't be choosy. Come on! Porter, get us out of this vehicle, please. PIANIST PLAYING "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" by Bach A twin room, madam? Yes, I think so. Name. What are we called? What are we calling ourselves? Don't answer! Only kidding. We're Mrs and Miss Dickens. She's my mother. She's the Miss. I'm giving her a holiday. How nice. She hasn't had a holiday for over 60 years. Really? Rather a longer pause than most people leave. I hope we'll make up for it. You bet you will! What's this? Your door-key. Keys look like this now, Lillian. What entertainment have you got? We're looking for pleasure. We have dancing...all the usual amenities. Hear that, Lillian? "Saunas, disco, adult TV channel." That means porno channel. We were hoping for that. We spend 120 quid a night, and get punished like this - roasted alive? What d'you mean, "Switch it off"? I can't "switch it off". There's nothing to switch! This is the fifth time I've called. You'd better bloody send somebody! The engineer's gone home(?) Then find another one! I suppose I deserve this. Right, let's do what rock stars do. Wreck the place! Ha-ha! Great! Might as well feed in everything I want to get rid of. My dental reminder. In it goes. Some pills...car keys... ..a few of Hugh's credit cards... shove my whole life down there! Clog it up! GRINDING Are you not feeling well? She asked me. She spoke(!) Thank you, but I'm fine, really! Isn't it great? No-one in the whole world knows where we are! I find that exciting. GIGGLING It's a kidnapping. Anything can happen, but I feel it'll be all right in the end. Will you pay the ransom? Dominic, it hasn't come to that. Of course I will, if necessary. Yes, I think you're right to do that. You're not insured, of course... Dominic! I hope the police look around here. That's where they should concentrate their efforts. Often, kidnap victims are held very close to where they were kidnapped, maybe half a mile. I hope they know. I'm sure they do, if it's true. Of course it's true! OK, I've made a note of it. I hate to think of your mother frightened. Lillian probably doesn't know what's going on. But your mother... She thinks she likes drama and... But she doesn't. How can you sit eating like that?! Are you sure they've been kidnapped? Of course. The struggle in the house, state of the car... No-one saw... After dinner, we should look at the clothes that were taken. That might give a clue, don't you think? TV NEWS: 'Shots were fired at army patrols and a blast bomb was thrown. 'Cars were pulled across the road and a church was set alight. 'The clearing up has gone on all day after a night of violence which, according to police, 'was caused by criminal elements intent on destruction. 'Police are investigating the disappearance of the wife of a city financier, Hugh Ambrose.' NEWS CONTINUES 'There are signs that a serious crime has been committed.' Where am I? '...that the lives of Mrs Ambrose and Miss Huckle may be under threat. 'We appeal to the public who may have seen a pregnant lady and a lady in her late seventies...' You must l-look what's on the machine. You must see it! Come and see! What's this? What's the matter with you? 'There were cheers for the royal grandmother when she stepped ashore at Greenock harbour.' I had no idea you felt so strongly about the Queen, Lillian. Now, let's get dressed for tonight. SOFT MUSIC: "Moon River" OK, let's slay 'em, shall we? I'm sorry, madam, the food's all finished. Finished? 9.30. It finishes at 9.30. It's now 9.35. I don't believe this! You're not serving food?! Can you believe it? All finished except the carvery. Carve-yourself meat is available. Carve yourself? Well, we'll make an exception. Can these ladies use the carvery? We're being punished, Lillian, like Hugh planned it. OK, they've asked for it! They're going to see some champion carving tonight! Don't take any notice of them, they're just jealous. MUSIC: "Let's Twist Again" Let's tuck in, shall we? I'm glad I've made you smile. You see? Her favourite dresses have gone. She's taken four of her favourite dresses. If she was being kidnapped, that would be unlikely. You're sure those are her favourite dresses? Yes, Daddy. Even I know that. They're for special occasions. She's taken her own suitcases, too. That Italian one. The police say they must have made them grab a few things. Maybe they gave Harriet time to pack. That wouldn't be a normal kidnap. Mummy wouldn't take her best clothes. It would be unnatural. Even for Mummy. Maybe. So what do YOU think it means? I don't know, Daddy. What do YOU think it means? Well, it CAN'T mean she just left! Left of her own free will. It would be terrific, of course. I mean, it could be she's safe, but... I can't imagine why, either, Daddy. I've been thinking, and I can't. Maybe Lillian did something to her. It was a mistake bringing her here. I'll get the police to bloody find them. It's time WE took a hand. They've had long enough. MUSIC: "Misty" Of all people to be lumbered with! After 50 years in hospital you get stuck with me - spoilt, ex-bit part actress who's a lousy mother. Worthless! Not an idea in my head. No real knowledge. No political views. Nothing. I know that. Well, don't be in a hurry to contradict me, will you(?) Hugh thinks of me as a kind of scatty, flighty creature that has to be trained, really trained, but who sometimes acts as hostess of his dinner parties very well. More! Lots more! MUSIC: "Let's Twist Again" I mean, Hugh is a good man. He is! That's what's so terrible - he tried so hard for both of us. The perfect provider, strong sense of family, and all that. And we loathe him for it! You see, you do! It's unforgivable, isn't it? The English, trying to be sexy. Pretty gruesome, isn't it? You must be thinking, "Wish I'd stayed away for another 50 years!" MUSIC: "Feelings" It's very unattractive, I know, to be so full of hate. Is there any worse feeling in the world, than hating the child you're about to have, and not knowing why? It's terrible, isn't it? And I have no excuses. One of the simplest things, isn't it, that feeling? And it really is quite horrible. Scary. I don't know what to do about it. What about you? Going to say anything to me? I don't think so. Why not? It's just us here. You despise us all, don't you? Yes, you do. You can't forgive. Why should you? The only thing you can do is start from scratch. I haven't got the guts to do that. I'm much less brave than you were. I can't even make myself leave him! But YOU did what you had to - followed your feelings, instincts, or whatever you call them. I'm guessing you did, of course, because you won't tell me. It didn't GET you very far. But that's something else. Are you listening to me? I demand your full attention. I know - I shouldn't be drinking, for the baby. But I am! If I wasn't so pissed, I'd say that looked a lot like us. It is! We're wanted on the television. Wishful thinking, Lillian! You want to be famous, do you? Want to dance, love? He won't want me when I stand up! MUSIC: "Singing the Blues" I have a funny feeling of getting bigger and bigger, swelling up by the minute. Think, Lillian - what would happen if we went away for another 50 years? What would we come back to? Know what I think? We'd come back to exactly this. The muzak might have changed, but not much else. ..because I believe my wife and my ageing aunt, under whose influence I believe she's acting, are staying normally in one of those hotels. People should be able to spot them a mile off. You're going to find them tonight, understand? Because you've made a balls-up of it so far. FIND them! I hope you're right about her favourite dresses. I've only got your word for it. Yes, Daddy. Don't worry, I'm right. Come on, please. Come on, ladies, time for bed. When we're ready. Lillian, tell me. What was it like being shut away like that? I often think about it. The whole war, for instance, must just have been distant rumbles and bangs. Was it? Going on somewhere far away? Tell me. Just one thing about it all. I know you find it hard to talk. I can't. Yes, you can! I can't, Harriet! It was...each little year... ..each year that went... ..I shut things away some more. Because...I'd shouted so much. One day, you can't any more. And...you get smaller and smaller, and tighter... ..till even the most ordinary thing becomes so...difficult. Everything stops working. Will that do? Was that the real thing, or just manufactured for me? I can't tell with you. That's what I like about you, I really do. You're so hard, Lillian! HARRIET PANTS Come on, let's climb, otherwise we'll be here all night. HARRIET PANTING Oh-h-h...! I can't move, Lillian. I don't know what's happening. I can't move! I'll get them. Stay there! I'm not going anywhere, am I(?) MUSIC IN ROOM This is a private party. You can't come in. You must... You must... Sorry. Private party. FRANTIC SOBS What's happening to me? Who's doing this? Did Hugh arrange this too? DID YOU? Is this what I deserve? I-I-I-S IT? Can somebody... < No, we haven't finished. We're off to the Casablanca. Excuse me(!) You must... She's... ..on the stairs. Looking for the stairs? With you in a moment. You'll be with me right now! Bloody fool! ALARM RINGS I'll never understand, never... ..how she could... No, Daddy. ..cause all these problems, have people running round the country. It's even been on TV. You have to expect that. On the national news, for Christ's sake? Everybody will have heard about it. What am I going to tell them? What? She never showed any sign at all that something was wrong. No, Daddy. None! Remember that. My God, she's going to have to explain a lot. These last weeks till the baby is born, she'll never be out of my sight. I mean it! I want her back, for God's sake! Are you the person with her? Are you the patient's mother? I'm...not...not quite her mother. She's suffering from eclampsia, a rapid rise in the blood pressure, an excess of water in the body. It's dangerous for mother and child. We have to get the baby out NOW. I must see her. That's impossible. Wait here. I MUST see her. I have something to give her. I MUST see her! That young woman could die. Stop wasting our time. Come and wait here. GHOSTLY MUSIC # ..I'm walking on air... ..walking on air... # ..walking on air... # The why and the wherefore # Is someone I care for... # You don't know what you're talking about, and I know you don't. That's what you don't like. DOCTOR: Who is the Prime Minister? A kind of monkey. Who looks at our teeth? A bloodthirsty man. What is the name of this country? I don't know. Black Island. Some name like that. A place that you fall through. Fall through?! Fall right through, and come out the other side. Why are you here? Because I'm cleverer than you. Because I'm meaner than you. Because I see through you. And it would be much easier if I wasn't around, wouldn't it? But most important, because you feel nothing. You don't feel this... ..and you don't feel THIS... ..or THIS...or THIS... Just like my father! # I'm yelling, I'm telling... # They'll come soon and find out where we are. Can we stop them? Stay with me! I can't listen to you any more, because I've stopped believing. You're talking nonsense, Lilly. I can no longer believe you exist. I have lost my faith. I can't believe such a boring, small-minded, lumpy man can be my father. So I've decided you AREN'T my father. You have ceased to be. Get away from me! No! NO! LET ME OUT OF HERE! HELP ME! I don't know what's the matter, but it's nothing compared to this place. What's WRONG with all of you? You can't even do THIS properly! BASTARDS! BASTARDS! QUIETLY SOBBING I don't know...what happened to all that time. It was just...taken away. I can't forgive. She was right about that. And to have to...start again...! It's a bit late... It's a little late for that. SOBS And it's...so tiring now! It frightens me... it frightens me so much. I don't want her to die! I don't want her to die! I expect they'll bungle it up, don't you? Make a bad job of it, like they always do. I'd better go and make sure they're doing it all right. They aren't doing it right. They'll make mistakes like they always do. I must see her! I don't want her to die! I don't want them to kill her! SOBBING LOUDLY FAINTLY: You do it right! You do it right! D'you hear? D'you hear me? You do one thing properly, you understand? You do this RIGHT! You can't go in. Oh, rubbish! I'll come for you in a minute. MONITORING EQUIPMENT CLICKS There you are! They say it may live. But it may not. The baby. I don't know if I want it. Still. Isn't that terrible? No. I could be dead, apparently. I nearly was. Yes. Stay there! I need to do this on my own. Out of my way, ladies! CRASH! Don't worry, he'll pay for the damage he does. He's collecting my mother, you see. Oh, Jesus, it hurts! What's that meant to be? What the hell are we going to do now, Lillian? Listen to ME asking YOU that(!) Yes. I don't know why you're laughing. You go to sleep now. Go on! I'll tell you when they're coming. FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE THUDDING # There's a rainbow round my shoulder, And it fits me like a glove... #
