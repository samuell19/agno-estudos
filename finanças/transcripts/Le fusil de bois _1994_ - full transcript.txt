An insurrectionary power has been established in Algeria via a military coup d'état. ALGERIA, APRIL 1961 This power has the appearance of a handful retired generals. In reality, it is a group of partisan, ambitious, and fanatical officers. Men whose duty, honor, and purpose was to serve and obey. In the name of France, I order that all means, I repeat, all means be employed everywhere to stop these men. I forbid any Frenchman and, above all, any soldier from carrying out any of their orders. Frenchmen and women! Help me! Getting screwed is becoming a family tradition. Does this mean the war's over, Sarge? THE WOODEN RIFLE WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY PIERRE DELERIVE What's the metal thing for on the front of the Jeep? It's for the wire. Wire? Since we drive with the windshield down, for the machine gun, the Fellagha put steel wires across the roads. There was this guy, one day, his head came off like a soccer ball. But he kept driving for a long while. If he hadn't crashed into a dune, he would still be going. What did you expect? "Welcome to summer camp"? Rookies... How many years have you got? It's been a while. I've been everywhere. Korea, Indochina... As corporal? As sub-officer. Look, Sergeant! They've got a wog driving! We call them "FNAs". -"FNAs"? -Yeah. French North Africans. Didn't they teach you anything? Is that really what they're called? That's the official name. I said "officially". Line up on B'chira. Sergeant Marc Dallers, right? Marc Dallers. That's me. Welcome to Trou sur Mer. I'm Jacques Lemaire. I'll show you your room. We're together. Rapp! Take them to the warrant officer. Guns, supplies, the works. Got it. Follow me, guys. Leave it. Lagrange! Take the sergeant's bags, and come with us. Lagrange! France woke up this morning, and, unfortunately, the clouds from the Channel to the Pyrenees will likely remain for the next... Here we are. It's no palace, but it's home. Hurry up, Lagrange. Let's move. Don't just stand there, Lagrange. Put it down. What are you waiting for? Go on! Hey! What the hell? Come on! I told you to leave, Lagrange. Hey! Get out! -Who's he? -He's kind of... the village idiot, if you know what I mean. Why's he here? Clerical error, supposedly. He'll be discharged, but in the meantime, he's here. -Incredible. -He's got it easy. He does chores, loads the trucks, shit like that. You can do that later. The lieutenant's waiting. What about the captain? Ain't no cap'n here. The lieutenant's in charge. Let's hurry up. There's no reason to piss him off. So he's... Morin? He's no treat, believe me. Hey! Cute, huh? You've got good taste. I like that. That's Monique, my fiancée. Enter! Sergeant Dallers, Lieutenant. At your orders. Sergeant Dallers... Schools... fancy diplomas... I see. Unfortunately, we're not going to stop the FLN with diplomas. As I always say, this is not a real war, it's a police operation. There's a difference. So it makes sense that we don't have real soldiers. What are people saying in France? Everyone hopes that it'll all be over soon. They "hope"? They hope... Even if we have to pull out of here like swine. We'll have learned nothing from Indochina. He's a clever one, General de Gaulle... and everyone else is a real idiot. Anyway... Has Sergeant Lemaire explained our job? I haven't had a chance. Well then. Our mission here runs along the electric fence at the end of the valley. Each of us is on guard every third night with a third of the platoon. Same goes for the other platoon, further north, and so on, up the border. Understand? Yes, Lieutenant. It's not very thrilling. It's not Indochina... But I don't give a damn. I'm waiting on my third stripe. As for the rest... Will you be made captain soon? Not too soon. But men like me are what the army needs. Men who go full speed ahead without worrying whether the light's green. Do you know what I mean? Some people in the administration are uncomfortable with heroes. Do you follow? Yes, Lieutenant. So they're making me hang around and wait. But enough is enough. Do you know why I'm telling you this? No, Lieutenant. It's very simple. I'm not going to give them a chance to make me keep waiting. So I'll tell you what I told Sergeant Lemaire when he got here. One little fuckup and you're done. It's very simple. -Got it? -Yes, Lieutenant. So, we're in agreement. For your sake, I hope the FLN don't cross the border in my zone. That's all for tonight. Break. It's like the grub. You get used to it. "Uncomfortable with heroes"... I'm dreaming, right? Come on. I'll show you the mess hall. The mess... I've got a feeling I'll be seeing a lot of him. He won't tear us a new one. Come on. Are you coming? Go ahead. It could be worse. We could be patrolling the Casbah in Algiers. It could be better too. We could try to get discharged. Maybe you... But me... You would go back to the middle of nowhere; I'd be in kingdom... Let's forget it. I can't. Sorry. Two years making jack, my career on hold, the Bar... You don't get it. Got that right! I've got a beet depot; I'm as well off in the army! I didn't mean that. But you said it. Plus, there's no one back home for you. They get it! What's up? There's a rabbit that got hit, Sarge. It's alive! They really want that thing! They'll get it too. A rabbit... Sarge, come quick! It's Lagrange! He could've been killed! He's nuts! Good thing they stopped shooting. Too bad, we could've been rid of him! Rapp! Go get me that damn fool! Make it fast! What the hell's wrong with you, Lagrange? You want to get killed? -Yes, Lieutenant. -For you. Yes, Lieutenant? No idea, Lieutenant, but no one told me not to bring him. Yes, sir. Right away. That's swell! Now it's my fault. You don't get it? I'm locking that imbecile up! He'll be out of our hair. It's not his fault he's like that. And it's mine? They're not bad people. I know some back home. Just what I needed! I just mean, he didn't ask to be born that way. When the parents drink, the kids are hungover! Got it? It's a real gem. Martinet! Shit... Joke's over. Get out of there. Lagrange! Do you hear me? Are you coming? Don't touch Lagrange! Is there a problem? There is, sir. I got Lagrange in my troop. I know. I just gave him to you. You were short a man. Sir... He can't even hold a rifle. Yep. Not everyone went to the academy. It's worse than that, sir. We're short men. We make do with what we've got. Of course, sir. But he's a danger. Not really. I took care of it. Have a look at his rifle. I was going to ask you about that. It's a wooden submachine gun. Not bad, huh? I had it made special. Ten yards away, you can't tell the difference. But why? I'm sure you would rather he shoot you in the ass? You could have just taken his clip. So he falls into a ditch and leaves his gun out there? Do you know what a lost gun costs, Sergeant? Just how I'll get promoted. Then why waste your time with him, sir? Why not just leave him in the barracks? And send someone else out two nights in a row? Do you think that's better? I don't know. I can't believe this. Does the colonel know? The colonel... The colonel ain't anywhere near here, Dallers! The colonel doesn't give a flying fuck! The colonel's in charge of a whole regiment. Get used to it, Dallers. This is war. Well, then! Your nice, tidy little world where everyone's nice and polite... No whining here, Sergeant! We don't complain, we figure it out. And we keep our mouth shut! You're six minutes late, Sergeant! Next time, I'll put you under arrest! Sixty-first night on watch, boys! I knew you and Zorro would get along just swell. "Zorro"? You haven't heard? Nope. Drive, man. Have a good night, guys! Red Three here, over. Over! Let's go, boys! Hurry up. Let's move! Move your ass, Martinet! -See you, guys. -Don't catch a cold. -Come on, man. -I'm trying to sleep here! Ten to one it's a deer. Are you sure you see something? I never said that. Five thousand volts, you said? When I write to my mother, I say it's only 110 so she won't worry. Rouches! Michaelangelo Two, Red Three here. We're done. Let's go! Faster, Lagrange! Yeah! Faster! Faster, man! Spin! Yeah! Turn! Rapp! What the hell? We weren't trying to hurt nobody. Lagrange had a beer, that's all. Beer? You've got alcohol in there? No, not alcohol, just a few beers, that's all. Forget it. What were you saying about Lagrange? He can't hold his drink. One beer and he's rolling around; he even plays dog. You should see when he sits and begs. Just ask him. It's entertainment. At least he's doing something useful. Don't worry about it, Sarge. -Latrines! -He'll pass out soon. See? I said he couldn't hold his drink. Are we good, Sarge? I didn't want him in the first place. No, thanks. All the modern comforts! A hole and two boards... You get used to anything. I wanted to ask you... What you were writing before, was that about Lagrange? You're right, it's none of my business. It's not that, sir. I write poetry. So... I just don't really want the guys to know. You know how they are. Have you noticed that Lagrange never smiles when he laughs? Lagrange... If I could pass him off to someone else... Anyway. People think he's laughing, but he never smiles. So I try to imagine. So my driver's a poet? CITY CENTER You know the drill, boys. The faster you finish up, more time for fun. And straight to the whorehouse! Right in the ass! Oh, the girls from Paris... Not exactly Paris, but let's hurry up all the same. You two, take care of the crates. You, you, and you, take care of the bags. Let's move, boys! Lagrange! We're on crates. Think about the ladies waiting! Rapp's on maneuvers! The lieutenant's been on rations duty... He sure knows. The brothel must be good. Maybe I've missed an experience. If the clap is what you call an experience. There's one who couldn't care less about the girls. You didn't go either. This is not the same. I love women... but I've just got my Monique! Sergeant. You won't believe what you missed! The boys wanted to buy Lagrange a girl. But none of the girls wanted to. They may be whores, but they've got some self-respect. But finally, the big girl, Marie Louise, said she'd beat him off. I couldn't be there. She may be a whore, but before she touched him... -So? -Hey, boys! After eight minutes and 47 seconds, fat Marie Louise had to stop because her wrist was too sore. I was dying! I would have gone again, but I was laughing too hard. Oh, no! This asshole! Gone a second time, my ass! Speak of the devil... I guess someone was horny! So, Lagrange? Sounds like you had a good time? Right. Next time will go better. Not for Lagrange. Oh, don't say that, Lagrange. There's a girl for every man, right? All right, that's enough. Let's get in the jeeps. Round everyone up, Rapp. A handjob! I can't even... You don't look amused. Come on, Lagrange! Dallers! Wake the hell up! -Dallers! -What's up? We're on alert! The FLN got through. We leave in five. Move! And grab your compass. The lieutenant put you in charge. -Where the hell is Rouches? -I don't know, sir. Here! Let's move! What's he doing? Come on, Minder! Shouldn't we have found it, sir? I know, man. I don't see this goddamn hill anywhere. Kemaken. It must be on your map. Keep going, I guess. I can stop at the next gas station if you want. Very funny. Just my luck. The one time we get to take the regiment out, we have to go to Kemaken Hill. What do we do, sir? A few road signs wouldn't hurt! I can't get on the radio. The whole French Army would hear. Plus the FLN. They must be having a good laugh. I know which way I don't want to go. What the hell's going on? -I think it's from the 4x4, sir. -Your 4x4, Sergeant! Who could have-- It's from us, sir. An accident. It was that dimwit Legrange again, Sarge. He started playing with the machine gun. "Playing with the machine gun". I'll take care of it, sir. We'll talk about this later, Sergeant. In the meantime, you're spending the night here. I expect your jokes will attract company. Let's move! Playing with the machine gun! What the hell do I with this guy? This isn't funny anymore! I'll give him a piece of my mind! Perhaps someone should look out for him, Sarge. The other guys might give him a going over for this. What a tragedy! Minder's right. Go back to the Jeep. So now I'm his babysitter? Great. Well, let's set up camp. I'm going to look around. That's not good. I wonder what they're talking about. About when and how they're going to cut our balls off. Our balls? Like you need yours here. Speak for yourself. I've got a girl back home. Look at them. Laughing it up. You know, they're probably as bored out here as we are. I still don't trust them. It's like Benbeka. I can't stand having a towel-head for a driver. What's wrong with it? I said I don't trust them. And where I come from, we don't much care for brown folk. Want to trade? Your driver for mine! No, thanks. But only because I like Minder. A sand monkey for a fairy wouldn't be a great deal anyhow. Shit! Sometimes I wonder how we can be friends. First of all, Minder's not a fairy. I believe. And anyway, what do you care? It's like you and the Arabs. You're one to talk. You'd get rid of Lagrange if you could. Hey, Lagrange. No, don't get up. Did you get some sleep? Me neither. What's in your hand? Go on, let me see. I'm just curious. Don't be scared. Can I see? Where did you find that? Down there? Do you want me to explain? No? This is nothing. Commemoration. We'll all get them. Including you. The red and white one with the two stars is for military valor. This... is a Croix de Guerre. That's for being wounded. And the red one there is the Legion of Honor. I don't know who this belongs to, but it's not just anybody. It's a pro. A... It's... pretty. They certainly are. The red... The red's your favorite? You've got good taste. That's the Legion of Honor. Ain't nothing better. What does your father do? Artichokes. Artichokes? That's what you do on the farm? Grow artichokes? Lagrange takes care of the rabbits. Rabbits are soft. They're soft? Aren't you homesick? I mean... Do you wish you could go home some days? Do you prefer this? Here, no one hits Lagrange. Who hits you at home? My father... my brothers... Depends. Depends on what? Who drank. Who drank... I see. I don't see anything. Have you got sisters too? -Yeah. -Yeah? They are beautiful. They sing me songs. Oh, yeah? Au clair de la lune Mon ami Pierrot... Lagrange! Quiet. Do you want the fellaghas to hear us? Do you want some coffee? I could sure use some. I'll get you some. Sarge! Look over there. Goat herders. Don't take this the wrong way, but we could ask them where we are. -Want to make some friends? -Yeah. Good morning. What's that road called? You don't know? Where does it go? Either start talking or start dancing! I think we found the best guides around, Sarge. Are you OK? Face down and shut up! Show me your hands! It's not easy to live off a teacher's salary. Latrines! I'm kind of lost. Before, it was college, grad school, then your career... then here. This is just a detour. It's more than that for me. It's more real. But this isn't the real world, far from it. The troops are real, so real. In their own way. He's been giving us enough trouble! Now it's our turn. He didn't hesitate, the retard! I would've shot off his ass hairs! Did you see the dive he took? Turn on the light, Rouches, just for a second. All right, that's enough. Troops! Attention! Let me tell you what I think. That was a really good joke. No, really. Honestly, very funny. But Lagrange, you know, he's something else. What are we going to do? Well, let me tell you. You up there with the machine gun, and your pal with the light, I'm reporting you! We don't fuck around out here! They'll get a month at the very least! As for the rest of the men who were in on it, I'm going to give them a hell of a hard time on duty. Either that... or you look out for Lagrange like you would your kid brother. I don't want to know how you do it, but when we leave here in four hours and ten minutes, I want to see Lagrange spruced up like he's going on leave. I want him to smell good. Well? What will it be? Are we in agreement? Yes, sir. Very well. Four hours and eight minutes. Break! You two, go get a blanket. Let's deal with Lagrange. I'm on it, Sarge. Don't worry. Julien, Martinet, follow me. Let's move, boys! Sergeant! The worst part's done. Do you want me to get your ears? Turn a little! I'm using beer, Sarge. It's good for the roots. That's all we've got. There's not a drop of water left. Hang on a sec. I'm going to have a look around, just in case. Say, Lagrange, you're as handsome as a little phallus! Lagrange isn't handsome. We had to use coffee to finish the job. There was nothing else left. Coffee? Then you won't blame me if I become a tea man! A glass of wine, Sergeant? Pass it on. Yeah, if it's not too hot. We here much longer, Sarge? How many months have you been in the army? Twenty-two, Sergeant! Hundred and seventy-one days to go. And you still ask that kind of question? Plus, don't you have shit to do? Blue here! Two and Three. I hear you loud and clear. Over. Roger that! Over and out! We're done. We can head back. That's what I like about maneuvers. They're instructive. How about a race, you and me? To that rock, see? -Are you nuts? -What, are you chicken? Are you scared to race a hillbilly? It's not that. See? He's chicken! On my mark. All right, you'll see. Full speed! -Scoot over, handsome! -I'm driving! On your marks... get set... go! Who's the greatest? Minder... Where's Minder? You guys are nuts. I said, where's Minder? We lost him at the bump! He was holding his rifle. Oh, Christ... Are you all right, man? Anything broken? We thought he was flying! He was hanging on to his rifle, the idiot! That reminds me of the story with the guy and the ladder. I can't remember the end. -Can you walk? -I fell on my tailbone. How is he going to make a living without his ass? Don't joke, I could have killed him. It wouldn't have happened to me. Look at my sand monkey. The bastard's glued to his seat. I'm just saying what everyone thinks. Hey, Julien. Tic-tac and toe! Smarts and stripes go hand in hand, man! I can't concentrate with their fucking music! Poor Martinet, can't even hear himself get a hard-on! Congrats, Lagrange! You got it first! Good job, Legrange! You're the best! Everyone with me! Bravo, Legrange! Bravo! Bravo, Legrange! Bravo, Legrange! Move it! Do you want my boot up your ass or what? What the hell's wrong with you, imbecile? -Look what we found, sir! -Good news, right? I somehow doubt it was for watching the Tour de France. I think he's wounded, sir. I'm not going to get myself killed for a sand monkey! Don't listen to him. Lemaire doesn't think before he talks. I don't see you going! Same thing. I'm scared! Roger. Over and out. They got them! So, what do we do? What was he thinking? Dallers. Stay in position. Rapp, take them away. We were the only hope for the engineers. The problem was our prisoners. The gooks were pissing blood. My sergeant says to me, "With these two, we'll never make it across the rice fields." No, thanks, sir. You're here as my guest. So I say when we stop. Got it? Where was I? Your sergeant... He says, "It's not even worth trying." It would take us all day. So I thought... for a second... Do you know what I did? I don't know, sir. I'm not surprised. I don't know many men who would have had the balls for it. I look at the sergeant, I laugh. I take out my friend... and I shoot the bastards. Point blank. A bullet each. And I look at my sergeant, and I say, "Problem? "Taken care of." Three hours later, we took the gooks from behind. The engineers were saved, and you know what we were? We were a bunch of goddamn heroes! So, you think: "Hell, yeah! Victory!" Right? Ancestor Morin becomes second lieutenant Champagne, decorations, the whole nine yards. Right? But no. Nope. This other asshole went and spouted off about the gooks. The colonel put me under arrest. Me? Can you believe that? So I said to the colonel, "A platoon of French soldiers against two gooks, "that's a bad deal, ain't it?" Do you know what he said to me? "That's not the question." So what is the question, Dallers? I don't know, sir. Well... Yes, I do. I don't have the answer. Still, this is what the army thinks of me. And this... this is for my good manners. -Do you follow me? -Yes, sir. I've thought a lot about-- Don't worry, Lieutenant. I got it. Lagrange... I know that idiot's giving you trouble. -You know, sir -- -I know it's true. I saw what happened. I haven't forgotten. I don't want him in my platoon either. Can I tell you something? The next time we're in a skirmish... The next time there's bullets whizzing by... you can take care of your problem, Lagrange, I won't say a damn thing. Tempting, right? But you have to have the balls. Have you got balls, Dallers? Rouches! Did you hear that? Shh! Is everything good? Everything's fine, guys. Étendard Three, Red Two here. Do you copy? What the hell are we doing, Sarge? I'm freezing out here! Yeah, we're going, but Rouches can't reach them. He can call on the way! Can you do that? Lock and load! Let's move! Cease fire! What the hell? Are you fucking crazy? What the hell's going on here? Rapp! What have you got to say? Not a big deal-- Oh! Not a big deal? Are you losing it? Maybe you don't give a fuck because you signed up for 15 years, but the rest of us are going home soon! Let's go, get everything back inside! Someone pick up these cartridges. Let's go! Pick these up! What is it? Lagrange lost the rabbit. Why did you bring him on the watch? You know it's not allowed. -Lagrange lost the rabbit. -I know. But maybe he'll be happier. He can run free. He is going to have fun? Of course! The army's nice and all, but it's not a lot of fun. Even for rabbits. Will he have friends? A whole bunch! What about Lagrange? Well, hey... I'm your friend. And listen. I'll buy you a rabbit tomorrow, in town. Do you want that? Come on, let's go. Is that Lagrange's rabbit stew? Yes, indeed, boys. Get in. Come on. I don't like hanging around here. Hey, that's the lieutenant's jeep. What's he doing here? What have we got today? The chef's special! Monkey! And... chocolate! Do you like chocolate? Yes! No. Yes! Here, catch. Back there. Here you go. I got your medicine, Aïcha. What the hell are you two doing? Do you want a photo? Take a hike! And who do they ask to lead the way when we go visit the colonel? Don't get upset, sir, but considering we just follow the road... Do you feel like writing your next poems in the slammer? Charge? Disobeying a superior. Hey! Are we getting close? My butt hurts. It's always something, Rouches! This is a paid vacation! But no, you've got to complain! Sure, but my butt hurts. He was looking over at the naked broad. "But I thought it was my sister, sir!" Do you seee the welcome brigade? The colonel was afraid you wouldn't find it. For you, Sarge. Yellow Six here. Loud and clear, over. Roger that. Over and out. Pull over, Minder. The welcome regiment's taking the lead. There must be a turn. They don't trust you. Shut the hell up, Corporal Minder! Who's that? A blue. Check out that salute. Takes himself seriously! He'll change his ways before I do. Stay 30 yards back. Calm down, kid. It's over. -A minute more and it'd have been us! -Then you couldn't complain anymore. You're a lucky man, Dallers. Anti-tank mine. We'll wait for backup. Precautionary measure. What's wrong with him? It's his nerves. Soldiers. By the way... your friend, Lemaire, he got hit. Shrapnel to the thigh. Can I go see him, sir? Just as well. He would have told me to go to hell. Take care of him. Hey. -Lucky you came with us. -Not so lucky. The boys in the Jeep are all toast. They don't need us. What about Lemaire? Blood transfusion. Hey, bud. So stupid. They're not going to decorate me for taking a piece of the bumper. Well, I guess I earned myself a trip to the hospital. -Does it hurt? -Stabbing pain. I pissed blood! What, Benbeka? I know, I know... All right, I have to go. Otherwise, the lieutenant's going to have my hide. See you. Sarge! What is it? It's Lagrange, sir. I think from seeing the stretcher. It wasn't a pretty sight. Lagrange! Lagrange! For Christ's sake! It's me. Everything's all right. Are you OK, now? We have to get moving. Lagrange! All right, get in my jeep. Ain't even smart enough to get killed. Help him out, for fuck's sake. Lagrange, your rifle. Come on. It's all over. Jesus Christ! Can't you change the record? Now that's what I call music! Studying up, Martinet? Very good. Hey, Lagrange. What's up? I have an idea. If you want, I can write to your family for you. What do you think? What do you want to tell them? You're doing well? You're healthy? Got a rabbit? That you want to become a career man! -Everyone is very nice to Lagrange. -All right. I'll write a first draft, and you'll tell me if it's OK. Your parents can read? Do you draw? Who are these people? It's the Lagrange family. That's why they're empty-headed. Do you want me to give him a talking-to? You're right. Attention! At ease. Imbecile! That's it! Two weeks arrest, one week in isolation! That ought to teach you. It wasn't him, sir. I knocked over the canister, sir. I apologize. You're lying. Why would I do that, sir? Everyone saw that it was this dumb bastard. Fine. If he doesn't pay for it, then you do. Is that fair? Perfectly fair, sir. I'll put you under arrest. The choice is yours. At your orders. Bravo, Sergeant. Can I have it when you're done? No way... Back from the dead! Yes! Can't shake, but my heart's in it. How are you doing? Good, and you? As good as someone who almost gave their life! Looks like someone put on a few pounds in there! Say, Private Rouches, do you know how to read? -Yes, sir. -Great. Then break. Sometimes... It hurts. -Speaking of, how's Zorro? -I can't stand him. We won't be keeping in touch. -All done! -And here comes the towel-head. I thought you were going to change? You can't unlearn an education like that. So, what's new? Same old... My barracks is empty half the time, my men are in and out of the sickbay with malaria or whatever, but I'm fine. Thanks. I've got 22 days left, so, you know... Christ! I've got 83 days left to rot in this hole. Other than that? Other than that... Tomorrow it's 21 days left. Fucking bastard! Oh! Sorry, Minder! Let's get good and drunk tonight! I can't. I'm on watch. Tomorrow night? Yeah! Let's go, guys! France will pay you back! Twenty-two days left! Then I'm going home! Don't wipe it too hard. You'll wear it out. What are you going to do back home? Go back to artichokes? Is there something else you want to do? Lagrange is not smart. My father knows people who are in medicine. I mean, he knows doctors. Do you understand? There are places where people... who aren't smart, as you say, can work, have friends, and be happy. Would you like me to look into that? All right. I'll write to my father tomorrow. Or tonight! On watch. How many days does Lagrange have left? Twenty-two, sir. A lot can happen in 22 days, Sergeant. That feels good. No two ways about it. Demobilization, boys! Hell, yeah! Demobilization! Hey, chief, 22 days left, huh? Since when do you call me "chief", Rouches? Excuse me, sir Sergeant. At ease. I think I'm a little drunk. Hey, towel-heads! Are you going to turn that shit down or what? Go get some fresh air, Rouches, right goddamn now! Some fresh air. Ain't that swell. Swell. Red Two here, over. Roger. Over and out. Inspection! We got ten minutes, boys! What the hell does he want this time? I don't know, but I don't want to give him any reasons. Listen up! Let's clean up! No dirty magazines, Martinet! My dirty magazines? That's a good one! In the name of the French Republic... I hereby bestow upon you the Legion of Honor. Thank you, Lagrange. Thanks for everything. You'll come to the wedding? It's not Paris, but it's nice. Just give me a call. In two months. We'll stay in touch. Here we go! What's up, Martinet? Apparently the porter gets a tip! Come on, you don't want to miss the boat!
