--== McEphie ==-- There are different kinds of accounts on social media. You have the ones that are legit, our normal accounts, where we go to express ourselves, to be entertained, and sometimes, to simply call attention. But what lurks beneath is another world online, where people can further express themselves, and be understood by other users without inhibitions, the "alter world." Anne, what did I tell you before? We had to fill 300 seats by the deadline, right? And what happened? You and your team failed. UNTIL WE GET BACK THERE SHOUT OUT TO THE HATERS FOR THOSE WHO LEAVE ME Wild, right? But to be honest, people are like that because they feel the real world is too wild and complicated for them. Because in the real world, it's hard for them to find true love. Love? Love in the alter world? Really? What if they just want a release? As it is, true love is hard to find. How much more in the alter world where things get… wilder? But… Eventually, everyone finds love. Even in the alter world. Take it from Rihanna, she found love in a hopeless place, what more in the alter world? Alter is a place where legit users want to simply release their stresses in a life that the real world won't listen to. And it's definitely not a place for love. Unless, you bring it to the real world. Not all alters are just for those types of releases, okay? There are people out there who just want to be released from their hopelessness in love, hoping that the alter world could change them, too. Cindy, I love you. It feels like a massacre already. But if you try to bring that love to the real world, you'll end up being more hopeless. Please, ma'am. Please approve my resignation letter. Why are you resigning, Carmel? Because I want to go after my boyfriend in Canada, ma'am… Your resignation is effective starting tomorrow. Is that clear? But sometimes, you shouldn't give up on love. Especially if it's worth fighting for. That's love. Love is always worth fighting for, in both the real and alter world. Uno! Hi, babe. Open your mouth for me. -You want more? -Yeah. Sorry. Baby, you're choking me. Dorothy! Fuck, it's my husband! Not all kinds of love is worth fighting for. Especially in the alter world. You give out sex, hoping to find someone worth loving. Only to find out that you were used. Good for a one night stand, not a serious relationship. You're not just a bunch of liars, you are all idiots, too! Wait until I get to the office. Even this? All I'm saying is true love cannot be found in the alter world. How did we meet again, Mee? Come over here. He's here. Come to Mama. Ouch. That hurts. Uno? Aimee? Giselle, I love you. That was just sex. No. That wasn't just sex for me. But that was it for me. Okay? Giselle, no. I know you're the one for me. I cannot love you. I won't. I'm sorry. Giselle. Fine. I don't want to sit with any of you, too. KNOW THE HARDEST THING TO TRUST IN THE WORLD? PEOPLE. SHIT IS REAL. Mind if I take a seat? The other tables are full. And, I don't want to sit with them. You saw that? Yeah. Can we stop speaking in English for once? It's lunch time, anyway. I'll be your lunch buddy today. Let's eat! Two… Three… Oh, no, this isn't enough. There, noodles. Is this a feast? There really is a feast in our province. Since I couldn't go home, I'll be there in spirit. Come on, let's eat. -That's all you're having? -Yes. Eat up. Can you not tell our bosses about what you saw? I might get into trouble. Don't sweat it. I also have one. Follow me. That's my account. But those are all reposts and retweets. You're a lurker, like me? Lurker and taster. Taster? Taster. I also "meet" a lot of people in the alter world. So, you've booked a guy before? Of course intercourse! Before I just went to those sex spas and forums. But what's trending now is this alter world. Why? What do you mean? And why do you have an alter account? So I could release my emotions. Especially when I don't want to share them to the real world. You're so dramatic. In my case, I literally just want a release. What are these emotions? Girl, we're not yet that close. Sorry. Wow. Sorry… you're such a bitch. That's why our colleagues don't like you. Just a tip, if you're going through something… release it. You have an alter anyway. Have sex. My God, do I need to emphasize that sex is, if not the best, one of the best kinds of releases? No need. I'm fine. I'll show you something. It's Dax! Here. I also follow that account. There you go. Why don't you book him then? Go, come on. Release it! Just try it. Besides, when was the last time you… had sex? You know, your thing? With that look, seems like it's been a while. Before you completely dry out, book him already. Have sex, you know, just plain sex. Because after that, you'll feel like you've seen one of the Seven Wonders of the World. My gosh. I'll give it some thought. I'll think about it, bestie. You called me, "bestie," so… does that mean we're best friends now? I'll think about it, too… bestie. But I feel like the answer is yes. Okay! Tres, drink your milk. And let's have another bottle. GARDO'S JUNK SHOP Giselle broke up with me. She was the one. Let me guess. You expected too much again. Just think of it this way, bro. Giselle isn't different from your other girls. Dad, why is it like this? I love with all that I am. But why does it seem so easy to leave me? Nothing lasts long enough. Don't worry. Someone better will eventually come along. Someone who'll be there for you until the very end, someone who won't leave you, and will accept you for who you are. You feel better now? Then tomorrow, you're going to get hurt again? And you'll cry again? And you three, you'll find reasons to get drunk again even if the food isn't good. You boys are really stupid. A toast for your future love. Cheers! Drink this. You people never learn! You really don't get it? After everything that I've done, this is how you guys repay me? You're all fired! All of you. I don't ever want to see any of you ever again. You're even recording this? You called for me? Good, you're here. Enjoying yourself watching my downfall? There, yes. But on these, no. Those are your performance assessment reports. That's three months since that happened. Some are exit interview records from the employees you fired. What do you want me to do with these? Turn them into scratch paper, ma'am? Do that. Then I'll fire you. But I can't… Sir Marc told me to give you a second chance because of your prodigious skills. But with that attitude, fuck those skills, don't you think? You and I both know why I had to do that. Our employees were going to our competitor. And for sure, they're sharing confidential information. They broke our trust. My trust. We were partners and you chose to do nothing? I did my part. I talked to them properly and in person like a proper HR head would. Because unlike you, I don't blow things out of proportion because of mere trust issues. Get your act together, Ruby. You can go. Oh, my God, Miss Katya said that? Too much. You're so fake. Drink with me. Faker! I'm not. I don't even know what I'm doing here. Waiter, one more round. This tastes like isopropyl alcohol, bestie. You know what, bestie? That bitch ran a background investigation on me. She even told me to not bring my "personal trust issues" to work. But what is your issue, really? There's too many. All of them. I trusted all of them. Especially Katya. She was my partner and friend. They broke my trust. Well, if Katya is your problem, then resign. No! I won't back down. I just really need a… release. Yes, release. I love the word. Release. So, I booked Dax. What?! Oh, my God, sorry. Sorry. Give me my space. Oh, my God, bestie. You booked the king of the alter world! And why did he reply to you and never to me? I've been messaging him. You're the only one who'll be happy tonight. No, of course not. I'm gonna book, too. Actually, not just one but two. You're so horny. Oh, my God. I can just imagine my water breaking. -Just a tip, okay? -Yes? You have to bring your A-game. Moan loud! Because guys like that. Yes! Practice. Okay. So try, "Come to Mama!" Come to Mama! Like that. Come to Mama! What was that? You sound like Tarzan! "Come!" Emphasize the word "come." Come to Mama! -Like that. -That? Okay. One last time, wilder! Come to Mama! You got it. Come to Mama! Come to Mama… Come to Mama… Sorry, guys, to keep you waiting… Come to Mama! Come over here to Mama! Come to Mama… Come to Mama… Come over here! Baby… He's here. Come over to Mama… I won't back down. One more round, boys. Aimee… Aimee… Aimee! Be careful. My head is aching. Hold on. Drink this. Thank you. What? It's been a while since I've seen you this close, Aimee. Ruby. Call me Ruby. In college, I remember your name being "Aimee Ruby." I like the name Aimee more. It means "love" right? It hurts. I know how to make you feel better. Here. Thank you. I'm hungry. Let's eat? I'll call to order. Outside. Let's eat outside. Just a midnight snack. I'll put some clothes on. Excuse me. Wow. This is just a midnight snack? Why is it that when you're hungover you become so voracious? Stop complaining. I'm paying for it anyway. I never noticed how beautiful your eyes were before. Your nose. Your lips. Did we do it? We didn't. You were not in the right state. And I would never take advantage of you. How did you end up with this job? Because I'm sure you never really wanted this. No. At first, I wanted to work abroad. I wanted to be an athlete. I wanted to travel. But after graduation, life happened. You like doing this? This is not just sex for me, Mee. Hold on, can I call you Mee? No. Ruby. Whatever. I'll call you Mee. I'll insist on calling you Mee even if you don't want. But if you want, I'll call you "Mine." You're blushing. Anyway, how can this be not just sex for you? Guys are only looking for sex. That's not fair. Some guys are in it for the long haul. And you're one of them? Yes! Yeah, right. You know what? I have a confession. Did you know that you were my first love? Really? Yes. You were the first person who made me believe in love. Even if we were in a long distance relationship, literally. Because I loved you from afar, without you knowing. Then one day, I found out that you had a boyfriend. This guy who took computer science. What's his name again? Ernest! There. Ernest, right? But since you're my first love, maybe you could also be the last? Why are you so grumpy? Try to smile sometimes! How can I smile when I'm going through a lot of shit? This is crazy. We're not close… for now. But here's some unsolicited advice. Fine. This is going to take a while. But for now, let's start with smiling. For yourself. And when you start smiling, you'll notice that everything around you will seem lighter and easier. So, smile. See? It feels so good. You ruined it. You had sauce all over your hands. But it feels so good. It tastes so good also. You know what tastes good? The food. Eat. Don't waste it. Smile, not for others… but for yourself. You chew so loud, Dos. It's annoying. How should I eat, then? Stop it, you two. And you, Dos, stop teasing Tres. And you, Tres, why are you so grumpy? Stop it! So grumpy! So, what are you up to? Dude, I saw my first love again. Wait a second. You told me about her before. A… Aimee Ruby Montemayor. There you go! Wait, let me look for it. Hold on, Tres. How did you know? Well, didn't you try to pair up your names before? Idiot. You're so old-school. Do you see this? "S." Do you know what it means? Sweetheart. We're sweethearts. So, you had sex? Why would you say that? Why? We didn't have sex, okay? She opened up to me. We connected. It makes me wonder sometimes, maybe the reason why I always fail in love is because I fight for the wrong person? Because right now, I know who's worth fighting for. And that's Aimee? Yes! Are you sure? I need to make sure. I need to work hard for it. That's what I'll do. Okay. Sir. I didn't know you were coming in today. Good work, Ruby. Thank you, sir. Thank you? Sorry for my slow progress. Thank you for that. I'm actually impressed by how open you are now. And you're smiling! -It's because of sex, right? -Sir? I had a little chit-chat with Tina. Don't get angry with her, but I think she may have overshared when we talked about you. But if sex does help you, then so be it, you know? Nobody's gonna stop you. And nobody's going to judge you for that. I'm not gonna judge you. Maybe use some kind of protection? Yes, sir! I have full trust in you, Aimee. And with your demeanor now, I want you to take it to the level where you should be at. Can you do that for me? Can I count on you? I won't let you down, sir. Good. We'll see. I'll go ahead. -Okay, see you later, sir. -See you. Bestie, what did he say? Maybe you need brake fluid to stop that mouth from oversharing! I'm sorry! It's because I couldn't resist our super-hot boss. So what did he say? He said I should continue being like this. But how? Wow, our first date is in a huge Korean barbecue place again. Wow! This is not a date. If you say so, Ms. Grumpy. Ms. Grumpy? Yes! Ms. Grumpy. Because you're always grumpy and annoyed. I have a job offer. A secret job. Help me connect me back to the world. Be my secret constant. Be my go-to person. But, keep it a secret. Don't worry. I'll pay you like a regular employee. You're keeping me? Keeping? Yes. It's a thing in the alter. if you wanna keep me for some time. Unless… you wanna keep me for good. I'm only gonna keep you until I'm open enough and trusting, okay? You wanna keep me? What's wrong? Wait! Let me cherish this moment. Never thought I'd be worth keeping. Why me? You don't want to? Of course I do! Uno… Am I not your first love? I'm just a wild girl, sitting across from a fuckboy, asking him to tame her. Got you! Thought you're the only one who can joke around? With that ugly laugh? So is it a deal? Can I trust you with this one? Can I trust you with my heart? Uno, what do you say? Fine. I'll do it. So… what's the plan? You should also pay attention to how you dress. So you can start connecting and opening up to change. Really? Yes! Check this out. There. Aimee. Aimee, you forgot your towel outside. This one? It should… show some skin. So, we've worked on your smile… we've worked on the way you dress… now it's time to literally work on your body. -Through swimming? -Yes! Swimming is an all-around sport. All parts of your body are being stretched. So how is this supposed to help me, then? When you have a flexed body, it's easier to move around. It's easier to reach out. And easier to release tension. Get set, go! See? Swimming teaches you to trust. Just trust that you'll be able to float and swim. What took you guys so long? Hurry up! I lost! You can't be late. You need to send it this afternoon, okay? Bestie! She got some action for sure. Here? Yup! Okay! What's so special about this place? Welcome to Gardo's junk shop! It's really nice. I never knew there was a spot like this in Mandaluyong. And that's our home. And here's where we hang out on a chill night, as a family. It's beautiful. I wish life could be this simple. Do you really just work all the time? I didn't intend it to be that way. And then? Share more. I grew up with just my dad. My mom died when I was still a baby. I believed everything he said. I trusted him. He told me he loved me so much, and then he left for Canada. He said he just had to work for a while and he'd send me money… but he never came back. Then I found out… he had another family. He had other children… and he never even bothered telling me. So the old saying is true, "promises are meant to be broken." You never tried to reach out to him? Never. It's too much. Too painful. And then I found out… two years ago… he passed away. He's so unfair. I wasn't able to confront him. He just left me… Just like that. He left me like this. He even told me, "Aimee, don't worry, I'll come back… because I love you so much." Fucking bullshit, man. I wasn't like this in college, right? I was so much fun to be with. I was… I was Aimee. But I had to be strong and fight on my own. All I have is myself. I needed to be Ruby. I told you this before already, smile for yourself, especially now. Then the next thing you should flex is your heart. You need to trust in love again. How? You need to… you need to be real with your feelings. And you think I'm not being real with my emotions? No. Because you keep denying and keeping it in. You lost trust… because of your past. You closed your heart because of it, right? 'Cause it's painful. Mee… To feel pain is normal when you're loving. You need to embrace the pain. So that you can be drawn back to love. Keep flexing it. It's effective. Let's meet for brunch, okay? Same place? Okay, cool. Don't be late, okay? Bye. See you. Thanks. I knew it. You're keeping Dax to yourself! Bestie, what's wrong with you? How did you get in here? You didn't lock your door. And we don't have water at home. And you said that I could feel at home, so here I am. Sit down. Thank you. So what is the real deal between you and the king of alters? What are you up to? Tell me! Okay, you're overreacting. His name is Juan Miguel Dakila. His nickname is Uno, not Dax. So I guess we have a winner. First name basis, huh? Because I feel like he was able to change me. It's like I've been reconnected to this world. Obviously. So what next? What do you mean? You're acting stupid! I mean, are you guys officially together? Or is this just a fling? Or just a way to release tension? We'll stay this way for now. So, you're together, but there's no F-F? What do you mean by F-F? Feelings-feelings! So what is he to you? All I know is that I still need him. What if I tell you I need him too? Go look for others. There's a lot anyway. -No. -Here. I want someone with a huge dick. I want Dax. We've been talking about this all day. We get it, bro. You really like Aimee. Bro… Do you think we could be together officially? Maybe if you stop this setup, what do you call it again? "Secret constant." If you stop that, you might end up together. I've deactivated my alter account. Good. You're so stupid. You're so negative. What's wrong now? You're getting your hopes up again. You're being used again. With something that you're not even sure you can get. When you grow up, you'll get us. Everyone allows themselves to be prisoners of love. Everyone is an escort, a whore, when you're in love. Ms. Aimee, here are the files. Thank you. GOOD MORNING, MS. GRUMPY! So, guys, Sir Marc and the management have been very pleased with our performance. So this weekend, clear your schedules because we are going to… party! Yeah! Wait, there's more! Not only can you bring a plus one, you can bring plus two! Okay, guys, there's more, I'd like to make an announcement on some org movements. As we all know, Katya will be going to India to put up our branch there. Therefore, we'll have Aimee Ruby as your OIC HR Head. -Really? -Oh, my God. Sir… Congrats, Miss Aimee! Sorry, I mean Ms. Ruby. It's fine, Aimee's fine, thank you. Miss Aimee, I hope you don't stop glowing. Thank you. I'll just make a call. Excuse me. Your fever is high, Uno. Take him upstairs, I'll find the medicine. Come on. Your temperature's high. You okay? Hello? This is Tres. You can't talk to him right now, he's sick. Uno? Dad! Where did you put it? Where is it? No, it's not here. -Anyone home? -I just put it here! Where is it, Dad? Hello? Hi, I'm Aimee. Where is Uno? He's upstairs. Thanks, I'll go up. Excuse me. Uno? Uno? Hi, Uno. I'm here now. Are you okay? What are you doing here? I'm sorry for bothering you. You're not a bother. I'm the one who's bothering you. You're never a bother. You should rest. It's not wrong to rest once in a while. I feel fine. I now know where you've been getting the advice that you keep giving me, especially about smiling. But don't fake it, okay? Because your body can only take so much. If you can listen to your real emotions, then can you assess how your body's really feeling. I'm the breadwinner of my family, but they're not imposing that on me. I took that responsibility on myself. I didn't know you were such a responsible son. Well, it's because I was such an irresponsible one before. So I said to myself… I will be better. I've been trying so hard to make it up to them. That's why I accepted these jobs to keep them from disowning me. Because, Mee, without them, I am nothing. I'm always here for you, Uno. I'll go ahead. Where are you going? You said you'll always be here for me. I still need to go back to the office. Stay for a bit. When are we seeing each other again? This weekend? Well, we actually have a party. I was going to invite you and Dos, but… At your service, Ms. Grumpy! I'll be there this weekend. You rest first. If you go there and you're still sick, I'll be mad. Rest now. I'll go now. Rest, okay? Take care, please. Yup! Oh, my God. Let's party. Girl… Bestie! Who are you looking for? Well… Sir Marc hasn't come down yet, right? He went upstairs. Don't worry about him. He's just off hosting. -Well, you have a point, Bestie. -Yeah. Aimee? -Dos! -Sorry, I'm late. It was hard to find this place. No worries. Where is… Uno? Is he okay? Why are you looking for him, huh? Dos, this is Tina. Tina, this is Dos. Hi, Tina Morando. that's my alter handle. Or you call me "honey", because I'm your future honey. Yes, I'm already deciding for the both of us. You know me? You've been flood-liking my posts. You saw that already? And it's just 14 likes! Why dressed so corporate? You going to the office? I wasn't informed about the attire… -The theme is supposedly boho. -I'll take that challenge. -Bestie, he's ready. -Colorful. He's stripping down because the theme… He's ready! Game! Will this do? Choke me, Daddy! -"Choke me, Daddy"? -Come on, let's talk here! I don't want to swim just yet. It's so cold. Aimee? You're alone. -Sir Marc! -Go have some fun! Later. I'll join the others. I hope we're not disturbing your household. Don't worry, my family is in Europe. It's just me and my cousin here. Your cousin isn't into parties? No. Just don't mind him. Let's go have some fun. -I will, sir! -That's an order. -Okay. I'll follow, I promise. -Okay. Go, sir. Tina's really something. A drink, please. What are you laughing about? Don't look at me like that! I get anxious. Are you feeling better now? I'm fine now, thanks to you. You want a drink? You did not… -Wait, let's get serious. -Yeah? Come on, let's swim. -Swim? -You know how to swim, right? Uno, I'm a bit buzzed now. Then that's better! Let loose! I was drinking even before you came. I introduced Tina to Dos, and then she said, "Choke me, Daddy!" Tell Tina to watch out because Dos will really do that. Dos should to watch out for Tina. They should both watch out. Oh, no… I'm so glad you showed up because… I don't have anyone with me. I was just sitting here with no one to talk to. At least you're here. Aimee. Uno. I love you. Cheers! Come on, let's go to the pool! Let's dance and go to the pool! Come on! Let's dance, because finally you're here and you're okay! Uno, come on! Let's dance. -Aimee, you might slip. -Let's dance first. Because it's fun to dance in the rain. It's fine to get wet for a bit, but let's not swim right away, because I'm a bit buzzed, and I won't be able to swim! Aimee, I love you. I said, Aimee, I love-- Are you okay? Aimee… I love you. Aimee? Ernest? -You okay? -Yeah. It hurts. Left leg. Careful. Still not working out, no? No. Oh, you. Foot spa? -That feels good. -Yeah? Here. Mee! Thanks bro. I got it. -Thank you. -Here. Drink it. You need it. You've got a weak stomach, remember. All right, stay still, okay? Stay still. Here we go. Okay, here? There. Okay. You know what? You need to go home. -I'll take you home, Mee. -I'll take you home. I'll take you. No, it's okay, I have my car. It's okay, I'll use my car. Yeah? We'll take you home. Okay. One last. All right. You okay? The air conditioner's not working properly. Hey, dude, thanks for letting me hitch a ride. Yeah, no problem. So, you want me to drop you off first? It's okay, let's drop off Aimee first. Uno should go first since my place is out of the way. Yes, ma'am. No, Aimee should go first. I'm all right. Uno, you should go first. -You sure? -Yeah. Okay. I've been looking for you, you know? Of all places, I didn't expect to find you at my second cousin's party. Small world. Small world… Small world, all right. You look familiar, bro. College? Yeah, Juan Miguel Dakila. Juan Miguel Da-- I know you! Comm Department! Right? What do you do now? I do-- I… do… Aimee? You do Aimee? No, I meant maybe Aimee wants to say something since she hasn't spoken since we got in the car. Why would you assume something like that? Sorry. Yeah, Aimee. Speak up. Uno's my swimming instructor. And a new close friend. "Close." Close. So you're just friends? Yes. All right. Okay, that's great. Cool. Aimee, tell me some stories? It's not like we just met. Dude, what are you doing here? I used to work in Paris. I was a head IT manager, but I resigned. It's hard to work abroad. I thought it's time go back home to the Philippines. Are you staying for good? You don't want to return to Paris? Yeah, for good. Marc asked me to come here and help him out in Elite. So, yeah, I'll be heading the IT department of the entire company. Does that mean you're the new boss? So, swimming instructor? Yeah, freelance. Freelance. Do you wanna work in Elite? I mean, just asking. For a more stable job. Am I qualified? Why not? I can talk to Marc. But… I'm not the one in charge of hiring. This girl is. You good? You look really good with all that rebranding stint. Still, bestie, I'm not yet used to exposing my arms. Your arms are so thin! Look at mine. It's still new to me. Bestie… Sir Ernest! Uno. You can drop the "sir", it's not like we don't know each other. He's right. You look surprised, it's not like we don't know each other, too. We bumped into each other in the lobby. And apparently, he's applying. Where do I proceed, ma'am… Aimee? Uno, just come back tomorrow, okay? Our hiring hours are done for the day. No, it's okay. I'll interview him. Follow me. Good luck, bro. I'll just get back to work. I can connect with people very well, ma'am, and I can communicate with them also. Let's cut this crap, Uno. Why are you applying here? So all this time, I could have spoken in Tagalog? The "English Only Policy" was stressing me out. Just answer the question, please. Because I want a more stable job. That's also what your Sir Ernest said, right? And the one you have with me isn't? Don't you want us to be together more often? Not just the per-hour basis. Because personally, Mee, I really like being with you all the time. You know why? Because I love you. Usually if it's like that, you'll have to key the code here. Right, like that. At the top. Because I typed the code at the top and a red button showed up. -So it shouldn't be there? -No, it shouldn't. But of course, you can change that. Miss Tina. Yes? Can you help me with this? Of course. I'll be back. What is it? I just want to ask again. Everything? Nice job. -Miss Tina? -Yes? Can I take a break? Okay, go. -Something light. -Maybe… light? Do you want to go to a café? Thank you for saying yes to this. After all this time… Aimee, I just want to say that I know I hurt you. I was a douche, I was an amateur. My dreams were bigger than my love, and I really thought you'd understand. I was wrong. I realized that what matters most in life are not dreams. It's love. Ten years for this. It was painful, I lost all trust in love. But you know what? Had I encountered you a few months ago this brunch wouldn't have happened. It's a good thing I changed. Let's close that chapter, Ernest. But I still love you. Always, Aimee. Remember when we first met? It was raining. We were in a restaurant, we were stuck. I do remember. Aimee, I just want you to know I'm willing to wait. I've changed. Trust me. Let me show that. Please, give me another chance to love you again. Uno? Are you together again? Stop this, please. I will stop if you two will. Aimee, I love you. I don't want to lose you, to Ernest or anybody else. Why? Are you my boyfriend? You're asking me? What's wrong with me? Why am I not enough? Tell me. Why can't you entrust your heart to me, Aimee? Uno, it's not you. Whenever I entrust my heart to someone, it always ends up being broken. They all eventually leave. Aimee, I'll never break your heart. I'll never leave you. I won't do any of that, I promise. I've heard all that. From my dad, from Ernest. Ernest? So you're acting like that because of your fucking ex? You closed your heart and yourself because of him? Aimee, how about the people who just want to love you? How about the people who will never betray your trust? Aimee, how about me? -Idiot. -Fuck you! What are you doing? Stop! Ernest, enough! Uno! No! Uno! Uno! I said enough! Hey! Stop it! What is your problem? There's nothing between us, Uno. I'm done with you. We're only meant for the alter world. Uno? Fuck! Why me? Why? Why?! Why me?! Uno. Stop crying. That's enough, Uno. That's enough, Uno. Yes, I agree. I think you need some space and time alone and away. But make sure you come back, okay? The company needs you. I will, sir. Thank you. Hi. Hi. Order? Sure. Can I have one flat white, please? Thank you, that's it. After everything, you chose not to pursue him? I don't know, I got a little confused. I realized that too late… I don't know. Aimee, get real. You know in your heart that you love Uno. You're just scared of being hurt. Thank you. You know what I think? I think… you should just pursue him. Go after him. Or else you'll end up… you'll end up realizing he already moved on from you. But after everything I said and did to him, isn't doing that a little too risky? But I think that's a risk that's worth taking. You think so? I believe so. What you and Uno have is real love. I know that, because that's what I have for you. But I took the risk for another chance. Yeah, but… why does loving have to be so painful? It's scary to love again. Aimee, pain will always be there. It will only get harder and scarier if you let fear get the best of you. So, what do I do? Always choose to love… 'cause love alters fear. At the end of the day, real love is stronger than any fear. Are you mad that we didn't end up together? I'm a little sad, but I'll never get mad with the woman I love. Thank you, Ernest. Hey, Aimee. I want the best for you, okay? Even if it's not me. I want you to have a love that is real, and that's Uno for you. Why did you suddenly become so kind? You are just too good. I'm putting my love life aside. I'm about self-love now. Enough with relationships. Okay, I'll see you there. Bye.
