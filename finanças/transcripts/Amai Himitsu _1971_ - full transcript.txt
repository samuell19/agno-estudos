A SHOCHIKU PRESENTATION A Kindai Eiga Kyokai Production "Going with the Flow" by Yoko Kozue I'd say yours is a very intense passion, isn't it? Well, you see... I don't have a wide enough network to be able to introduce such a manuscript. You see, since I've only read sections of it, I can't provide you with a comprehensive opinion. Well, you can leave it in my care for now, if you'd like. I will make sure to read it again when I have more time. - We'd appreciate that very much. - Yes... What a beautiful woman. Seems like she is the wife of a landlord in Hokkaido. She mentioned that he runs a ranch. Was the person accompanying her her husband? That appears to be the case. Why would someone like her write novels, I wonder? Well, I'm wondering the same. Please, go ask him if there are any prospects for success. But he did mention that he would keep it in his care. We specifically came all the way from Hokkaido for this. "I'll make sure to read it when I have free time." You never know when he'll do that, right? Why don't we come back another time? Hey, could you please go and ask? I'm pretty sure he'll be honest with you. I'll be waiting at the beach. Yoko... The Professor praised you! Really? It's the truth! He mentioned that you have a sense of reality. But seems like you need to refine the wording of your writing a bit more. What about the manuscript? I left it there. The Professor told me he would make sure to read it thoroughly. Yoko... Say, let's go back to Hokkaido. Come on, let's go back.

Would you give it a read in my stead? Huh? You get lots of requests like this, I assume. - Do you think it's promising? - I have no idea... There's a passion there that hits you... But that's quite a substantial number of pages. Yes? I've noticed that Mrs. Kozue, who was here the other day, has visited us again. Is that so? She said that she would like to meet you briefly. Tell her to come in. Professor... Well, I'm in a bind... - Oh, hello... - I apologize for the other day. Please, have a seat. Oh, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Isshiki, the Managing Director of Yubundo publishing company. I'm Isshiki. We were just talking about you. My, it's a pleasure to meet you. Your writing seems to be based on your experiences. Right. There are some parts that are interesting, but you'll need to make some revisions. Yes, if I do as you say, do you think it will turn into something? Well, if there's a publishing house that's interested in amateur manuscripts, you might have a chance. Professor, could you please let me have a look at this? Right, you could read it. Well, I'd be happy to read this kind of material. I'd be very thankful. Did you come all the way from Hokkaido again? I did. - But, this time, you came alone. - Yes. Well... I got divorced. Really? I arrived here two days ago and I am currently staying at a hotel in Tokyo. I see... Did Mr. Isshiki agree to take it on? Well, we'll see about that... Since his wife passed away, Mr. Isshiki has been all alone, right? Yes... I wonder what will become of those two? Don't say such things! Mr. Isshiki is a serious man, after all. All right, I'll be leaving you here. Would you like to enter? How about a cup of tea? Well, but, you see... I would love to hear your feedback. - Come in. - All right... Oh, so it was decided in the editorial meeting. That's good to hear. Yes, well, we made some adjustments in the editorial department. We decided to give it a try, and publish the novel... Well, I've heard others saying it's interesting. But, you see, Professor... I would like you to write a blurb for the book's cover. How would you feel about that? Well, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Yamaji, the artist who will take care of the cover design. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Hi. All right, have a seat. Well, I think a modern design will be more appropriate. So, it's not like I specifically asked Yamaji for a favor or anything like that. He is highly regarded in the Pacific Independent, and has a great reputation. Oh, I remembered. If you have any specific requests, please feel free to let us know. I have none. I'll leave it up to you. Yes? Oh, it's you. I mistook you for someone else. - Do you mind? - Please, come in. Oh, let me introduce you. This is my cousin, Akimoto. - This is Mr. Isshiki. - How do you do? Nice to meet you, I'm Isshiki. I have heard about you before. Thanks for taking such good care of Yoko. - It's nothing... - Here you have. Oh, well, recently, we were talking about you, you see? It's entirely thanks to your kindness that her dull novel is getting published, right? No, I cannot publish something out of mere kindness. I did it because I thought it would be profitable. A pampered young politician from the countryside like you, wouldn't understand anything about writing. Who do you think you're talking to? I don't know its content, but it's probably just like a schoolgirl composition - with a bit more sophistication. How rude! - It also includes parts about you... - Parts about me? Hey, my model fees are high. I feel like I should receive them. You're depicted as a naive young man. Huh? A naive young man? She truly captures the essence of her subjects. You seem quite pleased... - Please, have a drink. - Thank you. - It was quite sudden, wasn't it? - She was still so young, though. Who is that person? I'm not sure. Perhaps she's a hostess from somewhere. She was very beautiful, wasn't she? Thank you for coming. It was very sudden. She collapsed because of a cerebral hemorrhage. Oh my... "Going with the Flow" by Yoko Kozue It has a modern and nice design. It was authored by Kusaba Yamaji. Oh, it was done by him... This style may not suit my novels, but it suits yours well. Thank you for everything. - At any rate, congratulations. - Thanks for your support. This is my daughter, Sakiko. She's a 2nd year high school student. I'm pleased to meet you. I'm Yoko Kozue. You must feel lonely without your mother around, don't you? Yes... There's another person living here, right? I have an older son who is attending university. Indeed, it must have been very tough for you, Professor. Well, at one point, I was at a loss, and didn't know what to do. After being together for over 20 years, this feels like losing a limb. If there's anything I can do, I'll be glad to help you. Oh, thank you... But aren't you going to marry Isshiki? Oh, why do you ask that? No, I just happened to hear a rumor that involved you two. I met with Mr. Isshiki often regarding the book, so that explains the rumors. I thought that if you two ended up together, you would make a well-matched couple. I've heard that Isshiki is a serious and earnest man. I am not a serious woman, though. You shouldn't say such things even as a joke, you know? Mr. Isshiki made some changes to my manuscript, but somehow my mark seems to have been lost in the process. However, thanks to him, this book was able to come to fruition, right? Professor, thanks to this experience I want to become a novelist. A novelist, huh? Becoming a novelist is no easy feat, you know? But I intend to give it my all. Thank you for your support. I would like to become your disciple, Professor. I am not in a position to take on disciples... I am not a popular writer, and I mostly write unremarkable novels as a struggling author. I ran away from my home in Hokkaido, because I wanted to live freely, without being tied down by anyone, and be true to myself. I want to live relying solely on my own abilities. True freedom is not easily obtained. When you strive to seize freedom, you may end up getting pricked by thorns. Dad! Uhm... Hi... This is my eldest son, Yotaro. This is Yoko Kozue. - Pleased to meet you. - What do you want? The stonemason has come regarding the tombstone. Oh, that's right. Excuse me, give me a moment. Thank you for giving me a call. Yes, I came to Tokyo for a little while. I see. This is a bright and quite pleasant room, isn't it? It's just me here, so it's really comfortable. - Are you writing something? - Well... I'm thinking of trying to write a short story. Oh, how are the sales of your book going? They're not doing very well. I remember reading some positive reviews... There were also some negative ones. It's not bad for a debut work, I think. Do you really think so? Come in. - I'm sorry to made you wait. - Thanks for your service. - Your signature, please. - All right. Thank you very much. With things as they are now, it must be tough to make a living, no? I receive financial support from my family. I have my share of inheritance that my father left for me. - He was from Akita, right? - Yes, it's an old house. It's remarkable that a 300-year-old house is still standing. My mother, my older brother and his wife are still living there. Professor, please have a meal before you go. I am always treated to delicious meals at your place, so this is a return gesture. Come on, have a little more. - Don't you want to drink more? - It's enough. Oh, come on! - You know, Professor... - Huh? My mother wanted me to be with my cousin Akimoto, but my late father was involved in the Matsukawa business, so he insisted that I go to Matsukawa in Hokkaido. Hm, I see... The Matsukawa family moved from Morioka during the Meiji Restoration, and they have vast land holdings. Since it is forested land, it was not affected by the post-war land reforms. They possess such a vast amount of land that it's hard to know its exact extent. They live comfortably in it. With such a lifestyle, one could sustain themselves just by sitting down and eating. It's a life that feels stagnant, as if one is living in a state of perpetual inertia. I couldn't bear such a life, though. My cousin Akimoto came with me all the way to Sapporo for the wedding ceremony. We ended up indulging in drinking for a whole week, causing a ruckus by partying with the geishas of Sapporo before returning. It seems that Akimoto had feelings for you, didn't he? That's not a possibility to be ruled out. You also liked Akimoto, didn't you? What? Ah, I guess I got drunk... Excuse me for a moment. Ah, what a nice feeling! I had a little romance with Akimoto during our third year of high school, but now there is nothing between us. Is that so? Welcome back. Please, have a good night. Huh? Oh, it's you... Where were you? - I had dinner with the Professor. - Oh, at the usual place? Please, refrain from using such interrogative language. I heard that you had a relationship with your cousin, Akimoto. Huh, is that so? You said that you're able to live such a luxurious life because of the allowance from your mother, but it seems that was just a fabricated lie. You're receiving money from Akimoto, aren't you? I guess you figured it out. I have a school friend who works at a newspaper company in Akita, and they investigated it for me. - Being a detective is your hobby now? - I already suspected it. You married into the Matsukawa family in Hokkaido to cover up the affair between you and your cousin during high school, which caused a scandal, and your father took action to suppress it. Did we really do it as you say? It's true, isn't it? Even if it's true, it's irrelevant to me. You're really a mean person... Why am I mean? What's so mean about it? Say, Yoko... I called you yesterday and the day before yesterday, too. But you were not here. Why are you avoiding me? I'm not avoiding you. I was just out at that time. Come on... We were discussing even getting married, weren't we? Well, I've had enough of marriage, so I won't get married. But you told me you'd marry me. At that time, I just carelessly thought that way. Is that so? So, you intended to use me for the sake of publishing your novel? Please, don't say things like that. It's not manly. You might have used the publication as bait to get hold of me. I wouldn't know, would I? That's why I've come to dislike you. So, you like the Professor now? That's coarse. Watch your words! Come on, Yoko! Yoko... Leave! I see... I'll leave. Who was it that made your worthless manuscript into print? You're worthless, too. - Welcome home. - I'm back. - Do you want to have dinner? - No, I already ate. - Get me a glass of water. - Sure... - Where's dad? In the library? - Yes. - Welcome back. - How was your hiking? Oh, it was exhausting. I read Miss Kozue's novel. It's interesting. Really now? - Here! - Here's your glass of water. She's really attractive, don't you think so? Professor! Hey! - Are you taking a walk? - Yes. - May I join you? - Ah, sure, go ahead. Say, Professor, I've been thinking about coming to your place, and becoming an apprentice to assist with household chores. - What do you think? - Well... Can you handle household chores and kitchen tasks? Of course I can. I really love cooking, you know? But, you see, we're a poor household, and I also have two children... I believe I can become friends with your children as well. Do you think so? I would like to work wholeheartedly for you and your children, without disturbing the structure that exists in your household. By serving by your side, I'll hope to have the chance to learn. I wonder what people will say? Does it matter what people think? I'm not asking you to marry me or anything like that. As long as it's convenient for you and beneficial for me, then we'll be fine. Considering that it hasn't been long since my spouse passed away, let's think about it carefully. Really? You'll consider it? - Yes. - Pinky promise me. I'm so happy! I thought you two were getting married. Yes, I was also seriously considering it. I thought I was very clear to you about that. However, when I looked into her past, she turned out to be a terrible woman. It's unseemly to speak ill of a woman who dumped you. Right... Does she still visit your place often? I don't know how a person like that could write novels. Professor! - Oh, it's you... - I'm glad to find you! We almost missed each other... It's like a plot from a small melodrama, isn't it? - Are you heading out for work? - Yeah, just for a bit. - Tokyo? Hakone-Yumoto? - You seem to know all about it. I know everything when it comes to you. - I'm heading to Seikoen. - Do you mind if I accompany you? - What? - So, can I go with you? I'm so happy! Whenever it starts snowing, day after day, it's always snowy. In the quiet late night, with the snow falling silently, I can hear the faint sound of the waves, "Shh... Shh..." Every day, the winter in the northern sea is stormy. The gloomy gray sky of snow stretches out as far as the edge of the world. Like a phantom, seagulls of a gray color fly across the gray sky. Professor... let's go wherever the flow takes us. Ah, what a nice feeling... I'm beaming with happiness. Oh, that's right! What time is it? This is not good! What's wrong? I made a promise to meet Matsukawa at 2 o'clock. Isn't Matsukawa the man from Hokkaido who you got divorced from? I don't know why, but apparently he called me to have a meeting. If I go now, I'll make it in time. I'll be back in a moment. Can't you talk on the phone with him? I suppose he really wants to see me. Will you come back? If it won't be a disturbance to your work, sure. Of course you're not a disturbance... - Can you please help me here? - Oh, all right... Well... is this okay? I appreciate it. I need to call a car to pick me up. Hello? Welcome back. There is a guest waiting for you over there. Oh, I see. Shinsuke. Oh, hi... I'm sorry to make you wait. Let's go to my room. Yeah... It's been a while. I've heard you got married again. Yeah... - From now on, I'll be living in Hong Kong. - What? After my father died, I realized that there's a significant amount of debt. It's gradually increasing. And what will you do in Hong Kong? I ended up selling off most of the land to repay the debts. In Hong Kong, I have a friend who runs a trading company with various interests. When I saw him, he said, "I'll take care of it. Why don't you come?" So, I made up my mind. First, I plan to go there alone, and, then, later bring my wife and mother. That sounds hard... I don't plan to ever come back to Japan, so I wanted to say farewell to you. There's 500.000 yen here. - It's for your living expenses. - I can't accept that. If you're going there to start a business, you'll need money, right? You don't need to worry. I couldn't do anything for you, so it's the least I can do. Please, accept it. If you insist, then. - Have you been studying? - Yes. I'm very thankful to the Professor for helping me out. I heard that the Professor's wife passed away... That's right. It was a very unfortunate event. I have to hurry, so I'll take my leave. Ah, wait a moment. Give me one last kiss. Earlier, as I contemplated the events of last night, I felt my passion, which had been dormant all this time, suddenly awaken all at once. And the unbearable loneliness that came with it pushed me into a state of agonizing despair. Her hands, with translucent skin and graceful elegance, had delicate dimples resembling red flower petals. Her eyes, beautiful like black diamonds, were adorned with long eyelashes. And the enticing curves, from her cheeks to her lips, were filled with an alluring charm. And as all of those aspects seeped into my withered veins, the juvenile soul of that young woman completely consumed my heart. - Hello? - Is it you, Professor? It's Yoko. Oh, it's you? What's wrong? Where have you been? Me? I'm currently in Odawara. If you've come all the way there, hurry up and return to the inn. Have you been feeling lonely? I've been lonely, all right. I thought you might not come back again. Come on, please come back straight away, okay? All right. I see. And is she going to live with us? Yes, that's what she wants. - What does she plan to do here? - What do you mean? She is going to help with the household chores and study along with me. Say, dad, how about marrying Miss Kozue? I... I couldn't do something like that. Well, you see, I'm someone who studies novels... Sakiko, it's fine, right? Let's do it like dad wants. Sakiko seems to be against it... I'm not against it, but I'm not exactly in favor either. Dad, I suppose Miss Kozue really wants to come, right? Well... yes. However, I'd like to hear your opinions first. Since dad seems to be lonely, why don't we show him our support, Sakiko? I guess... Thank you! There's more... I'm thinking of inviting O-Suzu, who used to live with us, to come over. Yes? You're writing late into the night, aren't you? Yes, I have to finish this by tonight. Shall I make you some coffee? Huh? Never mind, I'm fine. - Have a good night. - Thanks... - Yoko. - Huh? Well... never mind... Master... Excuse me, I will go to bed now. Ah, thanks for your work. "Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter" by Simone de Beauvoir Do you think she has the potential to become a successful novelist? Well... I wonder about that... I believe that if she becomes your apprentice, and spends every day by your side, it would be a great training experience. Professor. I'm going for a little walk. Okay, go ahead. Let's see... All right, then I'll take my leave. Goodbye. - Sorry for this intrusion. - It's nothing, goodbye. I plan to sort out the assets in my hometown, and give my children their fair share. I intend to bring the rest with me. I'm considering buying land on the outskirts of Tokyo for farming. If you want a farm, wouldn't it be better to have one in your hometown? We will create a love nest together there. Your wife will get angry if we do something like that. Even though my wife doesn't say anything, I think she knows that I send you 100.000 yen every month. I don't want to be your mistress. If you're serious about it, I can consider getting a divorce and marrying you. That would be hard, I wouldn't be able to go back to Akita anymore. What is your intention in getting involved with the Professor? It's clear, isn't it? I intend to study novel writing. You're not going to marry him? No way. Did you come here just to make unpleasant allegations? Hey, Yoko! What exactly are your intentions towards me? I think of you as a kind cousin. It's not just kindness that makes me send 100.000 yen every month. Do you remember who took my body by force at that time? That was the beginning of my downfall. If you're so concerned about your 100.000 yen, then I don't want it! Yoko, are you upset? Yoko! I'm sorry. Please, don't get angry, okay? Continue to be with me as you have been, okay, Yoko? - No! - Yoko! I'm back. Yoko! Mr. Akimoto is indeed an admirable person, right? Do you think so? What's wrong? Can you really pursue novel writing with such a mindset? What's the matter? Stop going out so much, or quit trying to become a writer! Thanks. You work hard, Mrs. O-Suzu, but you're slow, aren't you? There's no need to be so excessively careful. That's just how I do my work. I get irritated when I watch it. It can't be helped since it's the way my late wife taught her. I assume your spouse was a devoted wife to you, taking care of household chores such as laundry and pickling. She must have been skilled at it. But I'm serving you as an artist, Professor. I cannot bear to do things just because they're a habit. When you arrived here, you made a promise that you'd keep the same structure and traditions of my previous household without altering them. I think you're an egoist, Professor. You only think in terms of your own convenience. It appears that you don't consider my position, at all. I do consider it. You are allowed to do as you please, aren't you? What am I to this household? Aren't you here as my apprentice? Is that all? What else would you want to be? You coward! If you feel that way about it, there's nothing to be done. Yes, I agree. This situation is not ideal, at all. Right, you know what you need to do, then! I have believed in your version of the facts and come this far, but I can't bear when you speak like that! Thanks... Master, I apologize for telling you this... Huh? I will be leaving tomorrow morning. I see. So, you're really going to leave, huh? I have been serving your late wife all this time, so I won't take orders from someone like that café waitress. She won't come back anymore... If you plan to remarry, please consider finding someone more serious. It's certainly strange to receive advice from you... I also bear responsibility for her running away from home. Professor, do you plan to eventually marry Yoko? She's too young for that, so it's unlikely. So, is it just a temporary affair, then? Well, I'd rather not be pressed with such questions... You know, Professor... Yoko also has a relationship with the painter Yamaji. Huh? The person who designed the cover for her book? Yes... Perhaps she is staying at Yamaji's place right now. Yamaji's house is in Kamakura, it's close to where you live. You're talking about Miss Yoko? Let's see... Yoko seemed delighted to be taken into your house, Professor. - Please, have a seat. - Thanks. I wonder when that was? We haven't met since then. I apologize for this rude and sudden visit... Since she left two days ago and hasn't returned since, I'm worrying something may have happened. I wonder if she is just being mischievous or loyal to her instincts? She's like a baby, innocently reaching out for whatever she likes, you know? Oh, here's my grandmother. - Oh, I'm sorry for intruding. - Welcome. My Toru is always causing trouble. - No, quite on the contrary. - Please, take your time. I've heard her say that she wanted to go back to her hometown. Maybe she just went there. Oh... back to her hometown, huh? After spending years confined to his home, and with life already nearing twilight, the emotions of the man were suddenly stirred up all at once. Above all else, her youthfulness, made his hardened, unfulfilled soul to come to life again. He was completely uneducated in the techniques of love. His timid heart gradually became more and more shameless, and was dragged into an situation with no prospect of rescue. Hey... Welcome! You must be tired from the trip, right? Instead of going to your house, I'd like to talk somewhere, just the two of us. Yes... How have you been doing? - I've been writing. - Really? That's great! Let's go back to Tokyo together. I want to return once I finish what I'm currently writing. Am I going back alone, then? Aren't you just going to remain here? I'm worried about leaving you here all by yourself. And with your cousin Akimoto so near... I'm not seeing Akimoto. I would feel lonely if you were to settle down here. The land of my hometown doesn't bring me any tranquility. Rather than finding peace of mind here, I feel uncomfortable and self-conscious. It's my own doing, so it can't really be helped, but even going for a walk attracts attention, so I can't really do it freely. It was a mistake to invite you to my house, after all. You don't have to return there. Just knowing that you are in Tokyo is enough for me. Why don't you continue writing in a hotel? I see that you have a cold side to you, but also a warm one, Professor. Huh? Hey, it's already 3 o'clock. You should go to sleep. Sure. I don't mind if you write about me. Aren't you a fiction writer, Professor? But if you write that I'm a promiscuous woman, using my beauty as a commodity, and cunningly jumping from one man to another, I won't tolerate it. I'm not writing bad things about you... I just wrote about your charm, and your free-spirited allure. Even without this, I'm constantly misunderstood, so if something like this is written, I will be socially ostracized. If you're ostracized, I'll be ostracized as well. Because you're a man, being hurt may be seen as honorable, Professor, but, since I am a woman, I will suffer greatly. So, you've been dating me just to rejuvenate your career, right? It is a means for the old Professor to become young again! How rude! I've been facing you head-on. I am staking my life on this! Hello. Good morning, Professor. Is something the matter? Oh, it's nothing... Welcome! Come in! Yoko... I'm sorry about the other day. No, I also got carried away. Forgive me. Am I a burden to you? No, not at all... Give me a moment. Hello? Yes, Yoko Kozue speaking. Yes, yes. I'll be there right away. Say, Professor... - Can you I go out for a moment? - Where are you going? I'm going to Ginza for a bit to meet Mr. Yamaji. - You mean, the painter? - That's right. You're meeting Yamaji, huh? I showed him my manuscript. He was the one who pitched it to "New Woman". And they've decided it just now. I've been waiting for his call. Well, I'm going out for a bit. Please, wait for me. Hold on. I just met a reporter from a weekly magazine downstairs. Be careful not to act too flashy. Okay! It would be nice if you took a shower and had a little nap. Ah... thank you. Hey! - Were you waiting for too long? - No, not really. I rushed here. The editorial department said it's interesting. Thank you for your recommendation. Let's celebrate and have a feast. I'm so overwhelmed with emotions that I don't feel like eating. You always look so dazzling. Mr. Daddy! 12 o'clock, huh? It's really late. I was dragged along to a couple of bars. Ah... I suppose you managed to come back safely, after all. Looks like the Professor's jealousy has started again. I'm going to take a bath. Oh, thanks for visiting us. Um... I would like to meet Mr. Yamaji, if possible. Well, I'm afraid Toru was working until late last night, so he is still resting at this moment. Even if it's brief, that's fine. I really want to meet him. I suppose I'll wake him up, then. If you don't mind, come this way to the atelier. Please, come on in. - Hello, excuse me. - Hi... That's a portrait of Miss Yoko! Please, have a seat. Where is Yoko? Where did Yoko go? Are you searching for Miss Yoko? You should know where she is. Well, I have no idea... I crossed Sagami Bay by yacht, stayed overnight at Imai's place in Marina Bay, and came back. Yoko invited you, right? No, I was the one who invited her. Huh? As a somewhat eccentric artist, I've long been interested in Miss Yoko's graceful figure. That's why I invited her to come. - Welcome home, dad. - Thanks... Yoko is nowhere to be found. She has also checked out of the hotel... I thought she might be at Yamaji's place, but she wasn't there either. Dad, is it that bad if Miss Yoko is not here? It's horrible. I'm worthless without Yoko! Could it be that Miss Yoko is in Yumoto? Maybe she's at Seikoen? You might be right! Give me a moment, and I'll give them a call. Hello, am I speaking to Seikoen? This is Inamura from Zushi. Can you tell me if Miss Yoko Kozue is there? Oh, really? I see, thank you very much. - As I thought, she's there. - Really? Is she? - You should go there right away. - Right, please come with me, too. - Okay, let me get ready first. - All right. Brother, going there with dad is embarrassing. What's embarrassing about it? This is what filial piety is all about. You wait here for a moment, please. Oh my, Professor! Welcome. Is something the matter? That hurts! Please, stop! You cheater! Stop it! My head is important! I have to make a living with it! What are you talking about? You don't need it! That hurts! - Dad! - Stop it! Don't be violent... She won't understand anything unless I beat her up! That's enough! I have never been beaten before, even by my own father. Hey, let's go home! Dad! Professor! Don't leave! I don't want you to go... Miss Kozue, I'm counting on you to take care of my father. If I go now, I can still catch the last train, so I'm leaving. - I'm sorry about this... - It's fine. Professor! I wanted to become a novelist who could live on their own. Please, don't abandon me. I beg you to help me. I wanted to become a woman who can live without relying on anyone. I understand! Yoko, let's build a house for the two of us. Let's create a home where only the two of us can live. You shouldn't be distracted by your surroundings. You need to value yourself even more and live your life. Right? Let's create that kind of environment. I want to develop you into a self-sufficient writer. Let's create a quiet environment where you can study diligently. I'm truly sorry about earlier... Yoko... Where have you been? Where was it? I just took a walk. Where were you last night? You weren't here yesterday or the night before either... You must have been at Yamaji's place, right? It's nearby. It doesn't matter where I went, does it? It's not like I'm a prisoner here, you know? I feel suffocated just being in this room. You're well aware that I borrowed this place specifically for you to study in peace. I feel restricted by your watchful eyes. You're not the kind of person who can be left alone, are you? I don't want to be tied down by anyone. I am risking my life to live freely. I wouldn't call it freedom, it's more like debauchery. You should just ditch such a debauched woman like me, then. What did you say? Excuse me. Come in. You have a visit. - Please, tell her to enter. - Sure. It's Mrs. Mitani from the women's literary magazine. I'm going out for a bit, then. Oh, it's fine. You can stay, since she already knows about our relationship. - Go ahead. - Thank you. If you excuse me. Oh, please, come in. Have a seat, please. - How do you do? - Fine. It's very quiet in here. Oh, Satomi and Takami also used this place to work. Is that so? It's been a while since I visited here. That's right. Kozue is also studying with me. Is that so? Professor, if I may ask, could you do me a favor for next year's spring issue? Sure, will you let me write for it? We'd be very grateful. You can have as many pages as you like. It's been a while since I last contributed to your publication. I'll do my best. Oh, could I also ask Miss Kozue to contribute with a short piece? What can someone like her write? What? But if it goes through your supervision, Professor... I apologize, but I refuse. Very well, Professor, the deadline is at the end of January. - All right. - I'll call you with more details later. - Thank you, as always. - It's fine. I'm sorry I couldn't help more. - If you excuse me now. - Thanks for coming. Have a good day. Professor, you signed my death certificate right now. I refused the proposal because you can't write. The reason you won't let go of me is not because you love me. It's just because you want to rejuvenate your withered blood, by drawing upon the youthful blood within me. That's right. Frankly speaking, I never loved you. I used you and wanted to rejuvenate myself through you, as the old, washed-up writer that I am. I became obsessed with your body because I wanted to draw upon the young blood flowing within you. It wasn't love. It was definitely not love! You finally spoke your true feelings out. You old fool! I no longer want to be a sacrifice. Your portrait is finally finished. Come on, have a seat. You seem unusually serious. Did something happen? I want to get married. Oh, that's great! With whom? With you. What?! Me? That's right. I'm being serious. Oh, I see. Seriously, though, I don't plan on getting married to anyone. I dislike using marriage as an excuse to confine women. Isn't that also just an excuse? No, I truly mean it. Then, why did you seek me? I simply wanted the touch of your body. That's all. - Wasn't it for the sake of your art? - Maybe it was. No, it definitely was. I wish I could just set fire to this atelier of yours! Come on, Yoko. The New Year's Eve bell will ring soon. A new year will soon arrive. How about we let go of the past while enjoying some drinks? What are you doing? Hey, that's dangerous! I'm not letting go of the past. I drag it with me. THE END
