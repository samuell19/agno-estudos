Yeah, and you never told me that your plan entailed burning the house down, so... guess we're even. Okay, well, my plan wasn't to burn the house down. I just had no options. Look, I wanted to have some fun. I wanted my... our first time to be special. I know you did. No apologies necessary. Was it really that good? Well, now you're just holding out on me. Okay, I guess we gotta find Wendy. - You'll tell me later. Let's go. ♪♪ Jesus! - What the fuck was that thing? - No idea, kid. I can't do this. What can't you do? What the fuck is the point, all right? It's gonna fucking kill all of us. Boy... Shit! - Okay... - There's two of them! Yeah. Here, you better take this and run. Go on. Run! ♪♪ Oh, God, no! Oh, God! Son of a bitch! ♪♪ - What the fuck? Oh, fuck... I'm so sorry...

Help! - Kid, run, run, run, run! - We have to fucking go! ♪♪ Run! Hey! It's okay. Okay. What the fuck... Hey! - Where the fuck is it? - I don't know! - It ran away into the orchard.- Listen, you little shit! - Stop it! Stop it! - What about the girls? - Shh! Bernice! - Where are my daughters? - Everything's okay. - No, everything's not okay. Look at our home! You should be ableto see that smoke for miles! Why isn't anybody here? Why isn't anybody here? - Where are the police? - Shh! Shh! - Where are the police? - Hey... My Dad was the sheriff. He's fucking dead now. We gotta get the fuck out of here, all right? - All right?! - - Nobody else is coming. - No one's coming. - Get in the truck. No one's coming, get in the truck. Hey! Get in the truck! You have to drive him to the doctor. Listen to me. Go and get a doctor. I'm gonna take care of the girls, I promise. - Drive to the doctor. Just drive. I'm gonna take care of the girls! - Wendy! - Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Shit! Wendy! Wendy? How you doing? So what happened back there? Are my daughters okay, Billy? I don't know, ma'am. It is Billy, right? That guy's been strangling women across the state line for some time now. I heard about this. Tragic. All those innocent women. Yeah. You guys had a serial killer here in town a while back, right? - That's right. - The guy that lived in our house before we moved in. Yeah, the realtor had to disclose everything before we bought the house. It's the law. - That so? - Yeah. We actually got a pretty good deal on it. You know, what I didn't get, though, was... How did he meet all those young girls? I don't understand the question. Well, what I mean is, according to the papers and the locals that they interviewed, Martin Ellsbury was both, you know, was handsome and charming, but he barely ever left his house, so how did he meet all these young girls that he killed? I don't know, ma'am. The Internet, maybe? Yeah, you know, I thought that too, but the house has not really been set up for cable, so no. I doubt he had the Internet. No, I'm thinking... someone did the introducing. Maybe a real ladies' man. Listen, lady. What's your fascinationwith serial killers, huh? Martin Ellsbury, this guy in this paper, wh-wh-what are you getting at? Oh, yeah. The guy that's doing the killings in that paper, Billy? He's dead now. Yeah. My husband and I killed him a few hours ago. Just like we killed Martin Ellsbury a couple of months ago. - You see... - Hey, hey, hey! We... my family has a... I guess you can call it a disease, you know, that causes us to feed every full moon once you reach a certain age. I mean, it's different for everyone, but for the most part it's between the ages of 16 and 18. Full moon. What, like-like-like werewolvesor something? Yeah, like that or something. - Wendy! - Wendy! She's not moving. Wendy? Wendy! Are you gonna come inside, or are you planning on lying out here all night? Okay, you're okay. It's over now. Girls! - Shit. - I am not explaining this to Dad. - That's on you. - Okay. Come on, let's go. So, like I was saying, my husband and I were certain that someone was introducing those girls to that monster. But we just couldn't be sure who. You knew the guy, right? - What was his name? - Martin, yeah. I mean, I sold him weed a couple times. Didn't really know him. So, while we were out taking care of that other monster, our daughters were supposed to be experiencing their first hunt. But I guess things didn't go according to plan. I mean, after your brothers and father showed up. Tsk. All's well that ends well, right, Billy? I mean, I'm sure you can figure out all the rest of it now. Your daughters... it was all calculated. ♪♪ They were fucking with us the whole time. Calm down, Billy. Listen, right now, I'm just an ordinary, concerned mother, trying to do whatever it takes to protect her children from the real monsters in this world. ♪♪ No! Okay, wait, Mom. I'm confused. You knew what I was up to the whole time? Juliet, I'm your mother. There's not a whole lot you're gonna get past me. And you guys planned to leave us at home so we could get our first hunt? Thomas, I think she's finally figured out our master plan. Yeah, yeah. How did you know that Billy was gonna be at the gas station that day? We didn't. It was just blind luck, just like we had no idea he was the one delivering those girls to Martin Ellsbury. Until you guys figured it out. How did you guys figure that out? Little things. He knew where the spare key to the front door was. He knew the layoutof the house way too well for someone who wasin it for the first time. Right, like he knew where the dining room was, knew we had a stoop out back to smoke on. A closet that locks under the stairs. The one thing we didn't know is that there'll be four of them. So... we had to improvise a little bit. Get them separated outside so we could hunt. Do you hear what you're saying? This is... Your Mom and I thought your first time would be... some lowlife. You had four very bad men. And you did it. You did it. It's-it's incredible. Mm, I have one questionfor you, though. Just tell me why you burned the house down? Dad! They had ustrapped inside! We couldn't turn inside the house. Thomas, a girl's first timeshould be something special. Can't expect them to hunt inside the house. Not the first time. You're right. Your Mom's right, you're right. Can we go? Can we go? Yeah! Thought we were never gonna leave. Well... This car is a piece of shit and it stinks, Dad. Okay, okay. Uh, the car is temporary. Let's watch the language dear, okay? So where to? What about the guy that's killing all those girls on the East Coast? Oh, they just caught that guy. It was a good idea, though. But we're too lateto help clean up that mess. I'll tell you what. Surely there'll be something on the radio, and, sadly, I'm sure there'll be plenty to choose from. Okay? - This car is indeed a piece of shit. Wash my mouth. ♪♪ ♪♪
