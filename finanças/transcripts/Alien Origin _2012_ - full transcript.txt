Holy.. You can't go up there. I'm going with or without you! Go! Cover! Come on, come on! Go, go, go.. This is a typical day for the men and women of the Belize Special Forces. Didn't know Belize had a Special Force? Think again. They do. And today, after nearly two years of quiet preparation with the best of both British and American Military Advisors, we are privileged enough to be here at Price Barracks for the unveiling of and participation in a new mission. As you were, Staff. Sir. All right, Guys. Thank you all very much for coming on such short notice. We have reason to believe that there will be illegal activity along the line of the border. And what we want your patrol to do is to go and place six remote cameras in the border area and return safely to us. You'll have three civilians with you. One is Ms. Julia Evans. Some of you may have read her book. Yeah, and Mark. We'll take it by truck from here through the Caracol Archaeological Reserve and drop off by Puchetuck Camp. From there, you will proceed on foot. At your discretion, you lay the six remote cameras in a line three kilometers either side of the Chiquibul River. That should take you about two or three days, and then make your way back to Millionaro Camp and give us a call, and we'll come get you. Are there any question? Sir, Bechenze. Yes, Staff. Will we have unmanned drones? There's no drone coverage for your patrol, so basically you're on your own. Oh, I'm actually going in the truck over there. No. No. You're riding with us, okay? Oh. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay? Sure. Looks like we're going in this truck. So what do you guys like to do for fun When you're not on missions? Drinking. Drinking? Drinking with my ladies and have a good time. Can I try? Yeah, sure. Will you hold this for me? Okay. Get in. Okay, listen. You follow in that truck, okay? Other march, remain the same, no change. Everybody understood? Okay. Let's move. (Foreign language) What did he say? He said that the ocean's a hundred miles away. No clue how the boat got here. (Whispering) It looks like we found some kind of boat, which is really random. Boat in the middle of the jungle, huh? Yeah. And then hold it back, too. How far away from the ocean? It's approximately 150 miles. Really? Really. 150 miles? How did this get here? We don't know. Is that what you found on the boat? Yeah. It's a camera. Card's probably still good. You sure it still works? No, but it body looks good. I think so. Can we see what's on it? We'll see. We don't have a reader for this size card. We have to do it back at the base. Here we go. Want me to sign it to you? Yeah. What's your name? Andrew. Here's to a lovely week with you in the jungle. And what is this you're putting on right now? It's a laser gun. No, it's not. Yeah. No, they're infrareds. Night vision infrared. We're neighbors. That would appear to be true. You're gonna fall out of your thing in the middle of the night, wake me up? Nah. I think your head is supposed to go on that end. There we go. Good. Good. What are you guys setting these cameras for? We're setting these cameras to detect any illegal intruders here we call the Xateros. People from Guatemala doing illegal stuff here in Belize. Like logging, farming. Also, we will set up these cameras around our camps. And also, the camera will detect any unusual movement. What is it? Howler Monkey. Croc. (Whispering) Hey, Pete. Pete. Go and get London for me. What's going on? What is that? It wasn't there last night. What? It wasn't there last night. No, I don't think so. That's weird. We have one more over there. What does that mean? I don't know. Have you guys seen anything like that before? Didn't hear anything? No, I didn't hear anything. Phil. Phil. Go look at this. Find the camera. Find the camera. Comb the area. Get them talking over there. (Whispering) Zero One, Zero Alpha. Send, send, over. Send, over. We'll give you a grid, over. Get down. One, Zero Alpha. Roger my location. I read: Bravo, Papa, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Romeo. Roger. Out. All right, Guys. Everybody can hear me? All right. Mission change. I have just get a radio message from high command. They have two archeological people went missing. Presently, we are at.. Presently right now, we are at Numeria Area. We have approximately 12 clicks to go to where these people went missing. Everybody now stand up. Okay, up it is. Move up. Oi. Oi! (Spanish) Anything unusual in front? Anything unusual? No. I just.. I heard a noise, Then everything went quiet just over that ridge over there. (Whispering) Okay. Okay. Take a tick or five. Looks good? You're good. Something doesn't feel right. You don't feel right? Something doesn't.. What about it? It feels like something's been following us along this side and then, like I said, it went quiet. This just doesn't feel right. Okay. What I want you to do, I want you to stay focused, okay? You look directly, especially directly in front. Anything unusual, you halt the patrol. Do you understand? I understand. Okay. I move back. As soon as I reach back, that indicate to you to move. Don't move too fast. Move just not too fast, not too slow, but stay focused, okay? Yes, Sir. Okay. A soon as I reach back, you move. Yes, Sir. You keep down. You keep down. Keep down. As we go.. You take a left, okay? You focus on your left. Are we good? Yeah. Hands above your head! Turn around, step out! Faster! Move, move, move, move, move, move, move! Hands down. (Mayan) Phil. Thompson. Sir? Guys, come have a look. What the fuck is that? I don't know. You think it's a fake? I don't know. Now, the good thing is it doesn't look as though anyone's been here for a number of years. And if there is artifacts here, it's good that we get to them first. The Mayans, they used to invade the caves, destroy the artifact. They used to think it was a way to the Underworld. Only the hierarchy were allowed to actually come in. So it's people like High Priests and Shaman. They used to conduct human sacrifices, rituals, do quite terrible things to be honest. And if they came across artifacts from previous generations, what they'd do is normally destroy them. They thought that was a way of banishing the evil. But it is looking good. I don't think anybody has been here so far. Looks to be a passage to another cave here. Just watch it, it's fairly tight here. Yeah. It looks like there's another cave, a big one out there. You still okay? Oh, yeah. Okay, let's grab a look at this. Susan. I think, I think we have something here. Wow. Well, you can guarantee there hasn't been anyone in this cave for many thousands of years. Something been broken. That's what the Mayans used to do. They used to break them to banish the evils of the previous. There's a fireplace. I feel like there's some more down there as well. What the..? Susan, come here. What the hell is that? My god. Susan. What is that? Okay. What initially began as a basic routine mission to establish cameras in the jungle to be aware of Xateros has now become one of grave danger. Two missing archaeologists are still unlocated. We have trekked through miles of jungle to come to what we believe was their camp where we have found food, cameras and other supplies, but no signs of the missing British and American individuals. We will continue looking throughout this afternoon and potentially this evening in hopes of finding these two people before grave danger such as dehydration sets in. In the meantime, I'll give you a brief rundown of Xunantunich, the Mayan Ruins where we currently stand. Behind you, you can see that these were initially built to be very tall. We believe the reasoning for.. We gotta go. What? We found the signal. No, no, no, no. Can I please just wrap up.. Now, down now. Oh, shit. Cut. Guys, let's go. Follow me. This way. Go. So apparently, we've just gotten word that one of the missing archaeologists has been found. They're about 30 miles away from here. We got a call on the radio. So we're trying to get our gear together as fast as we can, hopefully make some good time before it gets too dark, hoping they're all right or at least something we can deal with. So I've got my bag, we're heading out now. We gotta go. Yeah, I know. I know. You, too. Do you have your stuff? Yeah. Yeah, I got everything. Okay, and you got the shot? Yeah. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, I got it. Awesome. What the hell is this? Pennsylvania Dutch? They're Mennonites. German Descent. They're here since 1952. They're just common farmers. Buenos dias. Buenos dias. Camera down. Camera.. Camera down. Now.. Off now. (Spanish) They wanna give you a lift. Get in. I can walk. Get in. (Spanish) Sir, she's in the hatch over there. (Spanish) I know where he is. You sure you do? Yes, I know where he is. I'll take you to him. You need to show me on a map. Show you on a map? I can't show you on a map. I don't know exactly where I came from, but I can take you there. But you get.. Yeah. I can't describe it, what happened, where it is. I need to just.. You know what.. You're in a bad state. You need to get a Heli Extraction from here. And how long is that gonna take, six hours? I'll take you to Holden. I know exactly where he is. No, no, no, no, no, no. You need to sit down. I've been out here.. And then you can go. Thank you very much. I'm on my own. I'm just fine. If you wait out here, you can tell us the way that you came in. I can't tell you. If I could, I would. He's out there now at the site, okay? You're in no condition to come with us. I am fine. Jesus. Do not baby me. You look after her. She's your responsibility. You go after her. You look after her now. So you're sure it wasn't a helicopter? I know what a helicopter.. Record this conversation. Go. There's no propeller wash, no wind, nothing. Okay. So what do you think it was? At first, I thought it was one of those experimental crafts I hear you guys working on over there. But then when I saw it, I just knew it wasn't. Why not? I didn't feel.. I didn't feel a human presence. Something else was watching me. Hey, Man, can you just piss off? Hey. Wow. The lady said back off, Wanker. Yeah. Well, I get that feeling a lot when the Sergeant back there looks at me. Whatever it is, we'll find it, and we'll find holden. Promise. Lights off. This is it. Lights off. This is it. This is what it.. (Foreign language) You can't go. I'm going with or without you. Castro, follow her. Follow her. Guys, move. Go. Move, move, move. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Don't tell me we're going in that thing. Goddamn it. I don't.. I don't remember. I don't remember. Try and remember. We were dragged. We were pulled down a corridor. We were put.. There were green lights. We were both together. That's enough. But he's here. And we'll find him. We'll find him. Let's go. Carry on. This, this looks familiar. It's this way, this way. I think it's the right. This seems right. This seems familiar. I think.. This is it. Up here and we turned a right back there. Go. I don't know. This is it. This is it. He should be here. Is there any blood? Is there any markings, anything? There's nothing here. But I left him here. This has gotta be it. Then we're gonna have to leave. We have to leave. Okay. What if it was back at the other turn? If we went.. Instead of going to the left, we go back and go to the right? This is like a maze. We're getting lost. Okay. So let's go back, retrace our steps. I don't wanna get lost either, okay? We'll retrack once more. If we don't find him.. Okay. We have to exit. All right. Okay. Okay? Okay, let's go. Jesus, come on, Man. It's back down this way. I think I remember it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Fucking shit. I don't know. I don't remember. I thought that was it. There were green lights on the roof. There were track marks. We were stuck between.. I don't remember this. Gonna have to get.. No, we're not leaving him here. We'll go out. We'll get reinforcements. He's here. We're gonna get lost. We don't know what we're dealing with. We have to go. I'm not gonna come back and then wait. We have to leave. We have to leave. What are we gonna do, go back out there and formulate another plan? I'm not gonna endanger eight men for a man. We're here right now. We're gonna go. I'll give the orders. Let's go. You wanna.. We gotta go now. We have to go.. Shh. We gotta go now. We have to go now. Now, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go, go. Shit. She went. She's gone. She's gonna get us killed. Okay. She could have gone that way. Where is she? We have to leave. This is like a maze. We're getting lost. We can't just leave her. We need to backtrack. We need to head back. Did you see which way she went? We need to go back. Okay. Let's go. Okay. ' Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Get out of here! Move, move, move! Go, go. Come on, come, come, look. Move, move, move, move, move. Move, move, move, move. Go, go, go, go, go. Withdraw! Withdraw! Withdraw!

Our idea of what it means to be human changes all the time. Through genetic sequencing, we now know that Europeans carry up to 4% Neanderthal DNA. Nearly 5% of the people in the South Pacific, they carry Denisovan DNA from a Hominid we just discovered in 2008. Modern humans, they mixed with an entirely different species of Hominids. It's not just relatives, but a complete different species. What's this have to do with our problem? This thing, I had it's DNA analyzed and, well, it's us. It's a 70% match for modern human. This thing is our ancestor. It's everyone's ancestor. It's.. The Neanderthal, Denisovans, modern humans, they all have DNA that matches this thing. So that means it's just another Primitive Hominid that humans have mated with. No, no, no. It's not. It's what was piloting that ship.
