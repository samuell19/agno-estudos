I know. I know. If this keeps up, we won't be in London till Boxing Day. I know. get him there for the publicity. Only told you three times last week. How do I get through to you, birdbrain? Yeah. Sure, I can stall 'em. Till about 1 0:00. And then after that, we've blown it. Well, isn't there a short cut you can take? I mean, this is supposed to be the main publicity for the new album. Well, do it! You're not on your own, pal. Does he have to do that now? I know. I know. I was talking about it last week, but that isn't the point. The point is that we are sitting in the middle of a traffic jam... the proportions of which would astound you. There are three miles of roadworks and no way out. - Unless, of course, you can suggest something. - Today's top temperature: 46 degrees Fahrenheit. - And the same to you, sir. Anyway, this should help you take your mind off the gloom. - Remember the summer of'66. I know. I know. - Good day, sunshine - I know. - I know about it. I know. - Good day, sunshine I need to laugh and when the sun is out I've got something I can laugh about I feel good in a special way I'm in love and it's a sunny day Good day, sunshine Good day, sunshine Good day, sunshine We take a walk The sun is shining down Burns my feet as I touch the ground Good day, sunshine Good day, sunshine Good day, sunshine Good day, sunshine Good day, sunshine Good day, sunshine - Yes, Steve. - We're up a gum tree, Macca. - Why? What's up? - The whole bloody game's up. The tapes have vanished. Oh, that. Not to worry. Harry's got them. He took them home from the studio last night... and he's personally delivering them round to the factory this morning. Well, that's just it. He hasn't shown up yet. I rang his ever-loving missus, but she's worried because he didn't come home last night. - Did you try Sandra? - She hasn't seen him either. Okay. Don't tell anyone. I'll be right with you. Don't tell anyone? - Ah, Mr. Stanley. - Good to see you. - Inspector, thanks for coming. - It's a lovely day for a drive. - Marvelous. It's too late to stop it now, I'm afraid. The television campaign starts this week... supported by merchandising, point of sale, T-shirts, badges and a poster. Well, I can't ring Geoffrey on this one. There's no way I can tell him that it's gone missing. - They already knew. - Hopefully, it will be forthcoming. - Good morning, all. - Good morning. Yes, that's true. But the position is very serious indeed. Any extra liabilities such as this will place a great strain on your capital reserves... and increase the possibility of the company being taken over by Rathbone Industries. That's Rath. Rathbone Industries. They all seem to be here now. It would appear that a Mr. Harold Torrington is an employee of these companies. - Correct. - You are aware, of course... that he has a criminal record, which includes burglary and petty larceny. - Yep, we know. - I understand the tapes... entrusted to Mr. Torrington's care are extremely valuable. Based on last year's figures, at today's prices, I'd say about five or six million pounds. They're the equivalent of-- They're the be all and end all. - If they're lost, all is lost. - And yet it would appear... you were quite happy to place such a valuable asset in the hands of this man. Yeah. We knew about him when he joined... but he swore he'd been straight for a couple of years. I'm telling you, I believe him. He is straight. This whole thing's a mistake. Where was he last seen? Tom and Beryl saw him leaving the Old Justice about half 1 0:00. - He had the tapes with him. - And no one's seen hide nor hair of him since. - Nobody. - I must remind you that in this case... there are certain other agreements to be taken into consideration. Such as the arrangement entered into with Mr. William Rath of Rathbone Industries. In fact, Mr. Rath has asked me to point out to you... that unless the tapes are found by midnight tonight... the consequences will be... very serious. I guess we have to console ourselves with the fact... that everything that can be done is being done. I mean, the inspector is well on the case. He's got an up-to-date description of Harry... and the tape box. And everything... is being done. Thank you. The car is ready, sir. Ah. Thanks. Yeah. Well, thanks anyway. He told me he was straight, and I believed him. I suggested at the time it wasn't exactly the smartest move on earth. - What's he gonna do with the tapes? - Bootleg them. There are plenty of people who'd pay big quid to get their hands on those tracks. Big Bob, for instance. To name but a few. What's all this about a takeover by Rathbone Industries? - I didn't know about that. - Slight danger. Nothing you need worry about. Get hold of Big Bob, will you? - He's about, isn't he? - Yeah. I saw him last week. You see, there's gonna be all kinds of complications we haven't even thought about yet. Yeah? What? I haven't thought about 'em yet. - Hiya. All right. - Hey. - Listen, have you heard the news? - What news? - You know, about the tapes. - What about the tapes? Well, Harry, he's supposed to be taking them down the factory. - He's gone missing. - Missing? - And the tapes too. - Harry and the tapes are missing? They've been phoning him all night. Nobody seems to be able to raise him. - Who's looking for him? - Don't know. Great news, isn't it? - Oh, God. Well, what are we gonna do? - You know, I don't fancy recording them again. - No, no need to do that. You don't think Harry would go and do a stupid thing like that, do you? Yes, I do. - Ready to do one? Hello,Joey. Have you seen Big Bob? It's Alan. Yeah, have you seen him? No, no, I don't mean that. I mean have you seen him today? - So, what are we doing? - The medley. - What medley? - Okay, Paul, I'd like to hear a run-through. Okay. Ready? Brushes. Coming ready or not, boys. Yesterday All my troubles seemed so far away Now it looks as though they're here to stay Oh, I believe In yesterday Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be Very bloody appropriate.

Yeah. It's gonna be one of those days. Cheers, Harry. They tell me you just got out. I'm not a bloody criminal. Look. No mask. I ain't got any dynamite. Left it all at home. No. Really, I was set up. By this nutty copper. You know, framed. It's always been like that with me. Even at school they had it in for me. Boy Scouts. I got sent home from camp. Caught smoking. I wasn't the only one. They said I was a bad influence on the others. Same in prison. This cop frames me. I said, "But I didn't do it, Your Honor.'' Didn't believe me. I'm not a bad boy. Not really. I'm just... manipulated. I'll tell you what. I'll give you a chance. If you're fibbing and you do one thing wrong, you'll be out. I mean it. - But if you're straight with me, you'll be in. - Yeah, I want to be in. Okay, that's it. You're in. It's a pact. - Packet of what? - Pact. A deal. - A pact. - A pact. Apact. Apact. Apact. 'Ere, mate. Stick your moniker on there, will ya? My wife likes your music. I don't. But I'll get lynched if I goes home without it. - That mightn't be such a bad idea. - You're right. What room are we in? Ah, um, it's... 51 6. Ta. Oh, uh, okay. I'll be in the corridor if you need me. - What was that for? - I don't need him around all the time. - Yeah, but he's very loyal. - So is my pet cocker spaniel. - Don't let it get to you. - Don't let it get to me? Oh, no, I won't let it get to me. As far as I'm concerned, it's a beautiful summer's day. There's not a cloud in the sky. And there's probably a bluebird on my shoulder. Yeah, well, that's really gonna help, isn't it? You lose your grip, I'll work myself up into a frenzy, and we can all go and throw tantrums. Well, it's not my fault. I didn't hire him. Oh. I love it. Come on. Let's spit it out, shall we? It's all my fault. Bad judgment. Once a villain, always a villain, right? My judgment wasn't so bad when I brought you into the company, was it? Then you sing the songs, and I'll run the business. Talking about running the business, what I'd like to know is... how did we get so heavily involved with this Rath character? Yeah, well, he's part of that group that arranged the bank loan last year. You remember? We had a short-term cash flow problem. I showed you the papers. 'Course, I never expected to end up like this. Mr. McCartney, ready for your makeup. Zip-a-dee-doo-dah Zip-a-dee-ay My, my, my What a wonderful day Oh, plenty of sunshine going my way Zip-a-dee-doo-dah Zip-a-dee-ay There's a bluebird on my shoulder It's the truth It's actual-- Okay, now you remember the bit where you're in the china cup? Good. That's good. - Slow. Clap. Hold. Step, step, hold. And up and hold. And hold and drop. Not bad. Let's do it again. Come on. Once again. Okay. Hi. I don't believe we've been introduced. - What are you doing here? - I'm here to write an article. - Oh, yeah? - It's on the relative value of popular music... as a therapeutic tool for social services. I'm on drums. Members of the band on stage, please. Can I get some of your time later, to talk? You can have hours, if you don't mind waiting a minute. See you later.

He was around the other evening feeling great, going on about the new album. Oh, no, nothing like that. He was too up on it all. I wouldn't have been able to tell you if he was thinking anything like that. I'm his shoulder to cry on, you see. I can always sense how things are. Well, I don't believe it myself, but the pressure is most definitely on. Don't worry. Come on, San. Let's get out of here. See you later. Why don't you come along? Well, g'day, fellows.

All right. - Both of us? - Yeah, you come too. - Oh, great. What's happening then, Big Bob? Well, your man gave me a call. So I slips into something comfortable... hops into me new pickup, and here I am. - Do you like it? Me new pickup truck. - What? Oh, yeah. It's nice. What's it all about, then, me old fruit? You haven't seen Harry then? Harry who? HarryJames and the Golden Trumpet? Or Hare Krishna? No, Torrington. Works for us. Oh, him. Can't say as I have. Not lately, anyhow. Has he gone absent without leave? No, it's just his missus is worried about him. Not been up to his old tricks, has he? He had quite a promising career as a young lad, you know. Could have done very well with me. He gave that up when he joined us. Told me he had enough of the bent life. Not easy. Tried it once. Lots of willpower needed. I gave up smoking for two weeks. - Yeah. Anyway, listen, Bob. I've got to shoot over to the BBC. So, uh, thanks for comin'. It was nice seein' you. See ya. Here. How's your record comin' on then? - It's all right. - Give you a fancy deal on the side? Able to offer you very attractive terms at the moment. No tell, Bob. It's all legal nowadays. Well, what's it all about then? We're just wondering about Harry, and someone said he'd been to see you, and, uh-- - Look, I'll keep an eye out for him. - Which one? Me left one. Guess what. The advance sales on the new album have topped five million. And that's without the record. How we doin' for time? Ernest, tell the band that will be all for today. Repeat: all for today. Yes, sir. That will be all for today. Repeat: all for today. Hello, Ernest. Are you there? Here they come. Why don't you go back to the office. I'll be over later. Don't worry. We'll find him tonight. Come here! - Have you done this to my pickup? Have you? That's him. That's the box he stole. His fingerprints are coming up on the screen now. We sent a copy of those to the United States. the possibility, sir, that this fellow Torrington... is perhaps not working on his own? Well, he's not the only one with a vested interest. Well, I mean, we've got, uh, Rath... Steve Stanley, uh, didn't like the look of that drummer. Well, they could all have a motive. Insurance, perhaps. Yes. Insurance. Are you receiving me, Ernest? Say something if you can hear me, Ernest? The band is finished. We have now left the warehouse. Cops have seen everyone connected with Harry, and no one knows a bloody thing. he's headed for the States. There's some big bootleg operations over there. Big Bob didn't even know what I was talking about. The banks are worried. They need assurances. Still, could be worse, I suppose. Give my regards to Broad Street, baby 'Cause you know that I'll be there Oi! - Can I have your autograph? - Sure. - Sign mine. - Okay, but we're in a bit of a hurry, all right? Ta-ra. See you. Afternoon. this whole thing up,you know. I mean, a man is missing. He once, a long time ago, had a bit of form. And now here we are. We've judged him, found him guilty... sentenced him... all in one day. - Isn't that Paul McCartney? - Anyway... doesn't fit in with what he's been telling me recently. - Like what? - Ah, he feels more secure now. No scuffers breathing down his neck. Not so many nightmares. Even talking about having kids. I mean, does that sound to you like a man who's planning to rob someone? These things happen on the spur of the moment. Hello! I'm Terry. We met a long time ago at the Playhouse. - I don't suppose you remember. - I think so. Oh, yes, yes. How nice. Will you follow me? - What are we doing? - Interview and two songs. Yes. We'll do the interview first, if you don't mind. Uh, in here. One, two, three. Okay,Jeff? - Do you know William? - Yes, of course. Oh, great. Wonderful of you to come on. Grab a seat. Get me Conway at Billboard, will you? Anyway, it's great that you're here. - Any trouble parking the car? It's two or three minutes before. I've just got these half dozen questions. So, um-- - I'm in your hands. No problem. - Awkward as we go. - Um, is that okay for you, Terry? - Lovely. Go on green. Okay for level? Aha. So, right then. Well, Paul, it's great to have you with us, and, of course... all the listeners want to know, how's the new record coming along? Well, we finished mixing it last week, and it sounds good. Uh-huh. Eh, so we can look forward to an imminent release? -Well, um, it shouldn't be too long now. -Oh, great. Well, you can rest assured that all of us here in radioland... are eagerly awaiting the arrival of your new songs. - How many have you got for us this time? Twelve? - There's about 1 2 in all. - Great. Uh, all your own lyrics? - Yeah, I write my own stuff. - Great. Fantastic. Yeah, everything's going great. that do occur occasionally. The new album? Yeah, it's very exciting for all of us. - It should be out in the shops soon. - Yours? - Bless you for coming on. - You'll be getting your copy sometime in the next few weeks. And of course I know that goes without saying for all you lovely listeners too. Right then. Let's hear a little music, shall we? Cut. What a load of cobblers. Oh! Yes. Yes. - Afternoon, men. All right. Everything okay? - Hello, Paul. - Yes, fine. - I'm afraid Jeffrey isn't here yet. - Isn't he? - Sorry. - Oh, there he is. -Hello. Sorry I'm late. -Morning. It's all right. What happened? - Can you hear me? - Yeah. Right. Now, um, what's it to be? - " For No One,'' right? " For No One.'' -" For No One.'' You find that all the words of kindness linger on When she no longer needs you She wakes up She makes up She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry She no longer needs you And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one A love that should have lasted years You want her You need her And yet you don't believe her When she says her love is dead you think she needs you And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one A love that should have lasted years You stay home She goes out She says that long ago she knew someone But now he's gone She doesn't need him Your day breaks Your mind aches There will be times when all the things you said will fill your head You won't forget her And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears Cried for no one A love that should have lasted years Mmm-mmm Good.

Oh, it's you. What are you doing here? Slumming, are we? - Come in, son. - Thanks. Listen, you know my mate Harry? Did you notice him in here last night? - Is he the one who used to-- - Yes, but he doesn't anymore. He was here for a while with the rest of your crowd. Wasn't he? Hmm. Did you notice anything unusual? No, nothing unusual. Fancy a cup? No, I won't, thanks. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Uh, did he have anything with him? - No, I think he left her at home. - No, a box. A big blue one? That's it. - Did he leave alone? - I suppose so. You know how busy we can get here some nights. - I think he was on his own. - How did he look? - Wild as ever. Sure you won't have a drop? - Won't take a minute. - Okay. Go on. Always running around. Don't get a chance to see anybody. If you didn't run around so much... you might get a better view of the world. Here you go. Haste makes waste, and waste not, want not. That's what they say, don't they, son? What is this town if full of care? We have no time to stop... and stare. You see, I may not look to you like a poet. At first glance, you mightn't think it. - But the longer you look-- You wouldn't like to look at some poems of mine, would you? Thanks all the same,Jim, but, uh... - I've got to be off.
