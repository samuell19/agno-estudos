- You know, I'm always telling you that's the problem. That is the problem. You know what it is that we're talking about, this massive and all this other manure, and that apparently ... - Well, if you don't believe in God, Brandon, then how do you explain the creation of the universe? - How do you explain the creation of God? - He's always existed. - So has the universe. - Bullshit. Why, why is that harder to accept than an infinite God? - There is no way that intelligent life could have formed so quickly without some kind of divine intervention. - Oh, come on, Roger, now you can't honestly count someone like Jim here as intelligent life, can you? - That's good, I'm impressed, Brandon. I mean, that's almost witty. Almost. I'm gonna get another drink. - Like father, like son, huh? - Oh, let's drink now. I just wanna go drink, not dance. - You just don't know when to quit, do you? - We're gonna have to take this party elsewhere. - I'm out. - Michael, I'm waiting. - Okay. - How does he do this? Speak of the devil. - Don't. I've had enough religious discussion sfor one night. - What? - When did you guys get here? - Just walked in, man. - Yeah, what, and you leave me out there with Linda's law school chum? - Sorry. - Priorities, man. - Yeah. - Jack first, hello second. - Yeah. - Whatcha drinkin"? - Whatever's handy. - Hey Jim, look, everyone is kind of fancy out there. You sure we're not a little underdressed? - No, man, I think they're a little overdressed. - Yeah. - Alright. - Speaking of which, who's the guy in the $800 dollar suit? - He's Brandon Sinclair. - Of the Sinclair Vineyards? - Mm hm, Linda used to date him. - I'm impressed. - So was he. - Jealous? - Jim? - Hi, Lloyd, hi, Mike. - Hi. - Well, I guess we'll go rinse out some things. Sorry, excuse me. - Are you alright? - I told you he was an asshole. - I know you did. You gonna come back out to the party? - In a minute. Look, you just, can you just go play hostess, and I'll try to come up with some clean jokes, okay? - Okay. Jim. I love you. - I know. - How can you believe in spirits if you don't believe in God or Satan? - There's been evidence of their existence, eyewitness accounts, photographs, recordings, you name it, and I've contacted some of them. - With what, a wee-gee board? - Wee-ja. - What? - It's pronounced, Wee-ja, not wee-gee. It comes from the French and German words for yes, oui and ja, Ouija. And this is a planchette. - I don't care what you call it, dude. It's just like a game, like checkers, or chess. - For your information, dude, the Ouija board has been around since recorded history. It was in wide use as far back as 540 B.C. - I guess if Barbie dolls had been around for that long you'd be talking to them too. - Beats talking to you. - Well, that's â€˜cause I use words with more than one syllable. - Oh, would you like to talk about that? - Yeah. - Um, look, guys. Why don't we, can we play with the game? That would be fun. - Alright. Now, for the best results, the Ouija should be used by two people, preferably a man and a woman, and it shouldn't be sitting on a table. It should sit on our knees so that there's as much body contact as possible. Also, the two people should have clean, pure systems, so that the energy flowing from us to the planchette is as strong as it can be. - Are you saying that the spirits actually come through our bodies? - Oh, don't worry, it's perfectly safe. - I don't think I quite understand what you mean by a clean system, though. - Someone who doesn't smoke or drink, like you. Care to give it a try? - Oh, no, I don't think so. - Come on, come on, come on! - Oh jeez, come on, please? - Alright. - Alright, good. - Alright! - Good. I don't smoke either, and I haven't been drinking tonight. So together, we should be able to make a clear, strong contact. - I'll bet he wants a clear, strong contact. - Alright, one more thing before we begin. The spirits are lousy spellers and a lot of them like to lie, so just to play it safe, I'm gonna try to contact David, a spirit of a little boy who died about 30 years ago. - You mean you've actually talked to this spirit before? - Yeah, I've contacted him several times. For some reason he is connected to this particular board. - Why is that? - Well, I don't know, really, it's just that every Ouija board seems to have its own dominant spirit. Maybe it's because this board was made the day David died. - How do you know when that board was made? - David told me. - How do you know he wasn't lying? You said they liked to lie. Didn't you, didn't you say that? - Uh, I'd really like to try this. - Alright. David, are you here? Can you hear me? - Can I talk to him? - Yeah, go ahead. - How old are you, David? - Uh, thank you very much, goodbye. - Why did you stop? - Oh, that wasn't David. - Well then who was it? - I don't know. Like I said, they like to lie sometimes. - How do you know it wasn't David? - Well, David was 10 when he died, not eight. Besides, we have a special signal that no other spirit knows. - Ooh, that's a little spooky. - It's a little stupid. - It's a lot stupid. - David, can you hear me? Would you like to talk to us? David, is that you? - It's doing a figure eight. - That's David's signal. Would you like to speak to him? - Yeah, I would. David? I don't know what to say to him. - David, do you know me? David, will you return to the living one day? - Reincarnation? - That's what they all say. David. Will you be able to choose your parents when you return? - Yes. - Bullshit. - Why? You can't believe you were stupid enough to pick your parents? - Hey, I don't talk to cardboard. - Be careful, Jim, you're upsetting David. - What's he gonna do, haunt me? - David, are you alright? - Yeah, he's alright, he's just a little dead, that's all. - Shut up, Jim! David, are you alright? - Brandon, it's really racing. - Yeah, maybe he's late for the last flight back to limbo. - What was that noise? - It sounded like a gunshot. Excuse me, folks, pardon me. Oh, man, multiple sadness. Who owns the red Cobra? - I do, why? - Your tires are history, bud. - Uh oh. - Thanks a lot, Morar. - What, this is my fault? - Those are brand new tires, now how do you explain it? - I don't know man, maybe your buddy Casper did it. - That's right, because you made him angry. - Then why didn't he flatten my tire? - Why, because I was in control of the board. He held me responsible. - You're crazy. - You're drunk. And you're a loser, in the great family tradition. - Jim! Jim. Well, thank you very much for ruining the party. - You're welcome, but don't worry. The night is still young. - Are you serious? Look at me, I am furious with you right now. - I know, and you're so gorgeous when you're angry. - Look, don't joke when you're this close to death. - Okay, okay, look, I'm sorry about the party, and I'm sorry about Brandon, and I'm sorry about the crisis in the Middle East. - Alright, that's it. - Come on, come on. You knew you were taking a chance when you invited him. I know your heart was in the right place. It just didn't work out. - Jim, you promised me that you weren't gonna start anything with him. - I kept my promise, he started it. What did you want me to do, just sit there and take it? - No, uh, I guess not. - I really am sorry. - I know. Why do I love you so much? - 'Cause I make you laugh. - Yeah, Woody Allen makes me laugh. - I know, but I'm sexier. - Whatcha doing? - I lost my hammer. Use mine. - Sucker, you could have killed me. - Nah, then you'd come back and you'd haunt me and flatten my tires and stuff, ha ha ha! - I'm gonna flatten you. Sit down, sit down. Linda's putting Twinkies in my lunch again. - Ms. Brewster, this is Dr. Gelineau's office calling. We have the results of your test back from the lab. You can call us today until 12:30. - Hello, Linda, this is Brandon. I just realized I left my Ouija here the other night. Could you bring it to class this Friday? I'm having some friends over Sunday and they want to use it. Besides, I want to contact David and see if he's calmed down yet. Well, see you Friday, bye. - David, are you here? David, is that you? David, do you remember me? David, is it true that you can really choose your next parents? Do you know why I'm asking? The tests, they're positive. I knew it. David, would you like to, no, how come? J. Jim? What, you don't like Jim? Well, Jim's a really nice guy. Boy, David, you sure know how to hold a grudge, don't you? David? David, are you here? David, where are you? - Man, don't tell me you bought that crap with Brandon and that board. - Oh, please, what do you, do you see spaz written on this man anywhere? Please. So how'd the board jump off their knees? I dunno, man, he probably kicked it. He always was about as clever as a bag full of doorknobs. - What is it with you guys, anyway? - Linda, I guess. At least that's when the friendship ended. - You guys were friends? - Best friends. When we were kids. - Get outta here. - Yeah, I practically grew up in Brandon's house. Both my folks were alcoholics, and, uh, I didn't want to spend too much time at home. He thinks I stole Linda from him. - Did you? - No. No. I didn't even know they knew each other. I'd been off at med school, and when I met her, they'd already broken up. - You went to med school? - Didn't know I was such a multifaceted dude, did you? - I didn't know you had more than one brain cell, James. What are you doing here? Loafing, come on, lunch is over. - No, daddy, please? - Come on, I want to finish the job this month. - You are bringing me way down, bud. - You're a lazy scumbag, you know that. - Employment means nothing to me, pal. - Lloyd? Hey, hey! - David, are you here? Well, it's nice to see you made it back. R. N. G. Ring? My diamond ring? You know where it is? Where? D. R. A. N. Dran. You mean drain, like a sink drain? Which sink, the kitchen? The bathroom. Thanks, David. Oh! Ow, darn. There goes my nail. Jesus Christ, don't ever sneak up on me again. Fuck! Shit. Fuck. What are you doing home? - I live here. What are you up to? - I found my ring, remember the one that I lost when we moved in, see? - And that's such a monumental event that you started swearing? - What? - Your language, babe, I think gosh and darn are the strongest words I've ever heard you use. And when did you take up plumbing? - You're never gonna believe this. David, he told-- - Uh, David who? - You remember David, the spirit of the little boy? - Oh, I don't need to hear this shit now. - Jim, what's, what's the matter? They closed the site early today. There was an accident, and ... Lloyd, uh ... Lloyd got killed. - Oh, god, what happened? - There was a load of sheetrock, and it wasn't secured properly, and it fell. - I've never liked you doing that job. It is so dangerous. - Everything is dangerous. - Mr. Morar? My name is Dewhurst. Lieutenant Dewhurst. - Police? - Homicide. - I didn't know Fairfield had a homicide division. -I'm it! I'm also the bomb squad and the truancy division. Do you like magic? - What? - Magic, you know, card tricks, sawing ladies in half, magic. - Yeah, I guess. - Me too, I always wanted to be a magician. I don't have the hands for it, though, not, uh, dextrous enough. - Then how do you defuse bombs? -I don't know, no one's ever planted a bomb here. - What can I do for you, lieutenant? - I'm investigating Mr. Salvador's death. You ever been to Vegas? - No, why? - They got these two guys there, Sigmund and Roy. I mean, they are the best magicians I have ever seen, without a doubt. I mean, they do some really amazing things. You know, there's only one thing I like better than seeing a good magic trick. It's trying to figure out how it was done. - Lieutenant, we're not really talking about magic, here, are we? - No. I believe Mr. Salvador was murdered. The ropes holding the sheetrock on the scaffolding were cut, apparently with some kind of a hatchet. - Are you sure? - I'm afraid so. Did he have any enemies? - No, none that I know of. - I understand that you were with him when the sheet rock fell, now, is there any chance that the killer could have been aiming for you? - I don't think so. - Are there any other witnesses? - No, no, I'm afraid not. - And you lost your hatchet that same day? - I lost my hammer. - But it has a blade on one side, right? Have you found it yet? - No, no, I had to buy a new one. - Just vanished into thin air, huh? - Nothing up my sleeve. - Touche. I'm sorry for intruding here. - Jim, you didn't tell me you were with him. - I didn't think it was important. - It is important, it could have been you! - Hey, it was just an accident. That's all, it was just an accident, can we go? - Well, the lieutenant's not too sure about that. And neither am I. David, did you cause that accident at the site? David, don't lie to me. Are you still angry at Jim? David? David. Hello? - Where were you? - What? - You were supposed to bring my Ouija by class yesterday. - God, I am so sorry, I completely forgot. I went to the funeral with Jim. - Oh. Yeah, of course, uh ... Well, how's he taking it? - Well, he's sleeping right now. - That figures. - Brandon, that's not even fair. - Isn't it? Tell me, did he cry at the funeral? Face it, Linda, the man has ice in his veins. I've known him since I was seven and I've never seen him cry once, not for anybody or anything. - Brandon? How many times have you contacted David? - David? Quite a few times, why? - Have you ever seen him get that angry? - No, never. Look, did we just change subjects when I wasn't looking? - Brandon, I've been getting a little worried. I've been using the Ouija. - Alone? - Yeah, why? - Linda, listen to me. - Hello, hello? Brandon? Hello? - Hello. - Goddamnit, how many times have I told you not to sneak up on me? - Look, I'm sorry, next time I'll wear a bell. - Why don't you just rattle your fucking head next time? - What the hell's eating you? -I don't know. I don't know, I'm so scared, I feel like I'm going crazy. - It's alright, it's gonna be alright. - I'm pregnant. - Are you sure? I mean, did you see a doctor? - I already know. I have an appointment on Monday. And I've been having morning sickness all week. - Well, no wonder. No wonder you're a nervous wreck. You're not going crazy, you're just becoming a mother. Granted, it's almost the same thing. - You're not upset? - No, no. Of course not. - God, I love you. - I know. - And you love me. Even though you don't know it, I know it. I'm giving the board back to Brandon today. I've already made up my mind, David. There's nothing you can do about it. Oh my god. Dammit! - Hey! Hey! Do you know Jim Morar? - Yeah. - Where is he? Just go this way, you'll find him. - What are you doing here? - I tried to call but your phone was dead. - And you drove all the way out here to tell me that? - No, I want to ask you something about Linda. - You want to know if she snores. - I should've known better. - Hey, hey! Jesus, man, you used to have a sense of humor. - Okay, can you be serious for one minute, please? - I'll give it a shot. - Has Linda been acting strange lately? She hasn't been to a single one of her classes all week. - What do you mean, strange? - I mean like nervous tension, insomnia, nausea, any kind of erratic behavior? - How did you know? - Has she been swearing a lot? - Like a truck driver. - I think Linda's been using my Ouija. - No. - Alright. Alright, I know you think this is a crock of shit. But just bear with me for a minute, please. - Okay. Alright, when someone uses a Ouija alone, like Linda, she's very susceptible to the spirits she contacts, and the wrong spirit will take advantage of this. At first, he'll be extremely helpful and friendly. So that she's lured into using the board more and more. Pretty soon all she wants to do is use the board. Everything else, like going to classes, becomes unimportant. This is called progressive entrapment. When she reaches this stage, the spirit changes. He starts to frighten and terrorize her, gradually breaking down her resistance. And once that's done, he's able to possess her. - So, what you're telling me is that I'm living with Linda Blair. - Dammit, Jim, I'm serious! - I know, that's what makes it so funny. I thought you were an atheist, man. - Look, I'm not saying that it's a demon. Just the spirit of someone evil. Evil when he was alive and evil now that he's dead. I want to bring a medium by your apartment as soon as possible to exorcise the spirit. - You're serious. --Jim. How do you think I knew all those things about Linda? Those are all symptoms of progressive entrapment. - They're also all symptoms of pregnancy. - What? - Linda's pregnant, I'm gonna be a father. - Terrific. - Come on, Brandon, I mean, can't you be happy for us? - You gonna marry her? - Yeah. Of course. - You don't even love her. - Let me tell you something, you haven't talked to me in two years, so don't stand there and tell me how I feel. - I know you better than you think I do, Jim. I know why you dropped out of med school, does Linda? Because you knew you'd make a lousy doctor. Because you're not capable of giving a shit about anyone but yourself. - Shut up, Brandon. - And when you get tired of Linda, you're gonna walk away from her too-- - Shut up, Brandon. - Just like you did with school. - Just like you did with your parents, just like you did with-- - Shut up! - Jim? - What? - There's a phone call for you in the foreman's trailer. - Take a message, I'm busy. - It's your landlady, man, it's something about Linda. - She alright? Hello? - Jim, this is Mrs. Moses. - Is Linda alright? - Well, she's fine now but she was scared awfully bad. - Well, let me talk to her, is she there? - Yeah, just a minute. - Jim? - I'm right here, babe. - It was David. - David? - Yeah. Jim, he used to be so nice, but ... I don't know, I'm just so scared. - It's alright, babe, I'm on my way home. And I'll take care of it, I promise. Alright? - Okay. - Alright, bring your medium by tonight. - Jim, this is Zarabeth, best medium in Northern California. - Hi, thanks for coming. - No prob, heh. Hey, nice place. But, uh, you got yourself one gnarly spirit here, I can feel it. See, hairs standing up on my arm? -=-Mm hm. This is your expert, where'd you find her, the circus? - Okay, so she's a bit strange, but-- - A bit strange, her head looks like a friggin' rainbow. - You must be Linda. - Uh, Linda, this is Zarabeth. - Hi. - She's a medium. - How bitchin'. - Uh, yeah, I prepared everything like he said to. - Top-notch job, Jim, let's get this show on the road. - I can't believe you did all this while I was sleeping. - Okay. I'm gonna make contact now, so whatever happens, stay in your seat. Alright? If you stand or talk, the contact might be broken. Oh. Bummer. I forgot my crystal ball, ha! Ha, ha, ha, just a little psychic humor! I don't really have a crystal ball. - Should we hold hands or something? - Nah, that's just in the vampire movies. Anyway, my nails are too grody. Okay, let's talk to some ghosts. - Who are you? - Please don't hate me. - Who are you? - David. - David, do you know me? - Yes, Brandon, I know you. - How old are you? -10. I passed away. - Tell us. Why are you terrorizing Linda? - I love Linda. - Then why are you frightening her? - She hurt me. She won't talk to me anymore. Because of him. - Jim? - He is cruel. - You are cruel, David, Linda fears you. - I'm sorry. I was angry. I love you. - Linda no longer wishes to speak to you. I am taking the Ouija home with me tonight. - I know. - The woman you are speaking through is a psychic. She has the power to exorcise you from this apartment. - No. I'll go. I never meant to harm anyone. Goodbye. - David, why-- - Goodbye. - David, wait! - Linda, don't! - Ahh. Brandy, catch the lights, huh? - Huh? Oh, yeah. - Zarabeth, thank you. - Too cool. But I didn't do it, David left on his own. - Yeah, well, he sure knows how to make a dramatic exit. - Well, maybe I reacted a little too quick. - What? - I don't know. Maybe I should have given him more of a chance, you know? I mean, he's not evil, he's just, he's just like a little boy. - No way. No way, he is taking this thing home now, and that's it. - Believe me, Linda, we did the right thing. - Oh, for sure, I mean, that was one nasty ghost. Good thing the exorcism didn't happen. It would have been mondo tough. I see a vision. - What is it? - Me. In your car, going home. Just some more psychic humor. Come on, Brandy, let's hit the musty dusty. T-T-F-N. - T-T-F-N? - Uh, ta ta for now. Uh, thanks for letting me bring her. - Don't mention it. To anybody. - You did a good job tonight, thank you. - You ever heard of the word Malfeitor before? - Malfeitor? It's Portuguese, it means someone evil, why? - Was David Portuguese? - No, I don't think so. - And he's only 10 years old? - Yeah. - Whoa. He must have taken some mega vitamins, â€˜cause he was a real toughie. - Something's bothering you, what is it? - I see danger ahead. - For Linda? - For you. If you miss my house. Ha ha, ha ha! It's coming up on the right. - A little more psychic humor, huh? - All kidding aside, though, something is really icky. - Like what? - I'm not sure, stay by the phone and I'll call you later on tonight after I do the Nancy Drew bit. T-T-F-N. In the middle of the summer In the middle of the night She was deaf from her own heartbeat Still she heard something move It was just out of sight And the morning was way out of reach Questions may be answered By the light of the day Oh it's so far away - You! - Police are calling it the worst traffic accident in the county's history. An accident of a different sort claimed the life of a Fairfield woman late last night when she fell to her death from a second-floor window. The victim, Sarah Crawford, claimed to be a psychic and worked as a professional medium under the pseudonym of Zarabeth. Police officials will not divulge whether the death was suicide or murder, but a full-scale investigation is presently underway. - Thank you, Stu. Lee will be back with weather right after this. - Yeah, who is it? -Jim, it's Brandon, we have to talk. - Alright, I'll buzz you up. - Okay, but meet me in the upstairs lobby. - What's up? - Where's Linda? - She's asleep, man, why? - Come here. Zarabeth is dead. - What? - Someone or something pushed her out a window. - Jesus Christ. - She suspected something about David. She was gonna check on it, I think David killed her. - Wait a minute, man, the spirit killed her? - Yes, and I think he cut your phone line too, so I couldn't warn Linda about the Ouija, and he probably killed Lloyd. But that time I think he was after you. - Man, are you listening to yourself? You're telling me there's a 10 year old ghost flying around Fairfield killing people. - Look. I know it sounds crazy, but I am sure that I'm right. - Well, assuming that you are, why would he wait "til now? You contacted him long before Linda. - No, I've never been alone. I've always had people with me when I use the Ouija. - Okay, so you took it home, there's-- - No, I checked the box this morning, no Ouija. - Man, that's impossible, I boxed it myself. - Well, maybe Linda removed it when you weren't looking. She's obsessed with it, Jim, that means that she's already fallen into progressive entrapment. - Well, then I just have to find the damn thing and get rid of it. - It's too late for that. Linda is so open now, I don't think David needs it anymore. - You told me that that's where he got his power. - It's just a portal, you see, most spirits are trapped in their world and they can't enter ours without some kind of help, like a medium or a Ouija. - Or someone that's been opened by progressive entrapment. - Yes. - You're telling me that Linda is a portal for David. - Eventually. He'll possess her, unless we can stop him. That's why I'm going to Big Bear. - What's in Big Bear? - That's where David claims he died. Now I have to go there and check out his story. We can't fight unless we know exactly who he is and how powerful he is. For all I know, he's been lying to me since the first time I contacted him. - You're really going up there? - I have to. I feel responsible. - What, are you gonna leave now? - Yeah, until I get back, you keep an eye on Linda. - Brandon. Listen, man. Look, I don't know, I don't know if I buy all this. But good luck. - David, are you here? David, have you come back? Ah! Jim! Jim, help! - Linda? Linda, open the door. - Jim! - Linda, unlock the door! - Jim! Jim! - Jesus. - Jim, Linda? Is everything alright? Hello, Jim, Linda? - Mrs. Moses, call an ambulance. - Why, what happened? - Linda's hurt. She's unconscious. - Doctor Rogers, 1742. Doctor Rogers, 1742. - Duherst, what do you want from me? You know, I don't think I've got the dexterity to be a juggler either. My, my, that was rude. - I got a D in manners. - How well did you know Sarah Crawford, aka Zarabeth? - Why, was she into card tricks? -I don't know, but she managed to get her throat slit before she went through a window. That's a pretty neat trick in anybody's book. What do you think her throat was slit with? - A hatchet? - Whatever it was, her throat matched the ropes that were cut on the construction site. Have you found your hammer yet? - No, I guess it just vanished. - You know, I saw this magician once. He managed to make an entire elephant disappear. An entire elephant! That's no mean feat, either. Just a tiny elephant is pretty tough just to stick up your sleeve. Of course, I know that he didn't really make that elephant vanish into thin air. He just managed to hide it someplace. - Mr. Morar? - Yes? - I'm Dr. Gelineau. - Is Linda alright? Your diagnosis was right on the nose, a mild concussion. That must have been quite a fall. - Yeah. How's the baby? - Linda missed her appointment yesterday, so I didn't get a chance to tell her, but she's not pregnant. - But, she's had, she's had morning sickness all week. - Nevertheless. I'm sorry. - Can I see her? - Sure, but she's still unconscious. - I'm going with you. What's our first move when we get there? - The Big Bear Public Library. - Why? - Why not? - Well, as long as you've got a reason. Oh, hello. - What? - Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me enlarge it. Bingo. A gasoline explosion aboard a small motorboat claimed the life of 10 year old David Simpson early yesterday morning. Funeral services for David, the only child of John and Betty Simpson, will be held this Saturday at the Green Meadows Cemetery. - Well, now we know David is telling the truth. We still don't know why he's terrorizing Linda. - How do we find that out? - We ask his parents. Damn it! There's not one listing for John or Betty Simpson. - Didn't the article say that David was buried at the Green Meadows Cemetery? - Yeah, so? - So, maybe the caretaker has got their address on an invoice. - Jesus, don't do that to me, alright? - Sorry, man. Look, nobody's home, the place is locked up. - Oh, damn it. I guess we're just gonna have to come back tomorrow. - You know, as long as we're here, I'm gonna check out David's grave. - Why? - Why not? -No, Jim, don't! I've got a very bad feeling about this. Oh God, I've got a bad feeling about this. Jim? Jim? Where are you? Whoa! - Shit. - Oh, God, you scared the shit out of me. - Shut up, just shut up. You're gonna get us both arrested for grave robbers. - Where were you? - I found someone I want you to meet. - Who? - David's parents. Look at the date, man. David's parents died on the same day. Less than two weeks ago. - Must have been some kind of an accident. - What if it wasn't? - I'm going to try and get some sleep. Gotta get out to the dock first thing in the morning. - I don't suppose you have an extra toothbrush in that bag. - I'm afraid not. - Damn, I hate talking to ghosts with plaque on my teeth. A little psychic humor. - God, why are we laughing? - It helps us forget how scared we are. What happened to us, man? We used to be like brothers. - I don't know, things change. People change. - I didn't steal her from you, you know that. - I know. It's just that every time I see the two of you together, I go crazy. I start saying stupid things and I can't stop. I tell myself, Brandon, stop being such an asshole. Then my mouth pops open and out comes another stupid quip. - You're still in love with her. I envy you then. You remember what you said about me quitting med school? - Jim, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. - No, no, you were right. You know what I'm afraid of more than anything else? That I'll never be able to love anyone. And that I'm gonna end up spending the rest of my life alone. If I had any real guts I'd get out of her life before she wastes any more of her time on me. - So tell me. What does she see in you that she didn't see in me? - I make her laugh. -So did Il. - Yeah, but only in the bedroom. - You really are an asshole, you know that? - Yeah. - Linda! Linda! Linda, come here. - What'd you get? - Take it. Let's go. - Oh, man. Haven't we seen enough of these? - We're gonna need it to contact David. - Man, I got a real bad feeling about this. What are you doing, man? I thought we had to put this thing on our knees. - Not this time. Since this is where David died, contact with the spirit should be very strong. - Not too strong, I hope. - Don't worry. If I'm right about Linda being his portal, she's too far away for him to reach us. - What if you're wrong and the Ouija's the portal? Man, we're gonna be opening the door if we use this thing. - I'm not wrong, Linda is his portal. David can't hurt us here, we're too far away. Besides, he can't do anything while she's sleeping. She's under sedation, right? - Yeah. - Linda? I think you should stay and let us run some more tests. - Oh, no, I feel fine. I just wanna go home now, thanks. - David, why are you terrorizing Linda? N-O, N-O-what? T. - N-O-T. Not? - David, do you mean you're not terrorizing Linda? Then who is? - Evil. What the hell does that mean? -ldon't... Wait a minute. David. You were at Jim's party, weren't you? And you flattened my tire? David, now, this is very important. Please tell us the truth. Did you kill Lloyd at the construction site? And you didn't kill Zarabeth? But you did speak to us through her. - No. Then who the hell did we talk to? Again with the evil. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, I think I have it. David, is this evil another spirit? Is this spirit powerful? Did it force you out of Jim's apartment? Is this spirit's name Malfeitor? Then Linda never actually contacted you all the time she was using my Ouija. - Alright, then who's Malfeitor? - That's what we're gonna find out. David, who is Malfeitor? - Her, who is her? - David, do you mean Linda? Well, then who is her? - What's wrong? - I don't know, he's agitated, be careful. David, are you alright, what's the matter? - Hey. Didn't you say they were lousy spellers? - That's right. David, did you misspell the word? Alright, okay. Just try again, one more time, slowly. Who is Malfeitor? H. E. R. - What happened? - I lost him. It happens sometimes. David. - Can't you get him back? -I don't know! David? - What is he trying to spell here? -I don't know! David? - H-E-R E, here! Malfeitor is here. - But he can't be, that would mean-- Jim. - Brandon? Brandon! Oh, oh ... Ugh. Ugh, Jesus! Oh, God. Oh, oh, God. Oh, God. - David? David, where are you? David, what have you done with Jim? David, answer me, goddammit. Dammit. You bastard. - Carlos Malfeitor was a fairly notorious mass murderer in his day. He killed nine people, chopped them all up with an axe. - Whatever happened to him? Is he still alive? - No, the police finally caught up to him around 1930. Shot him down in his own home. There it is. - Hello? Yes, I'd like to speak to Linda Brewster. She's a patient in room 310. No, no, 375. It's an emergency! What? When? - Linda? Jesus Christ. Linda, I'm trying to help you. - Fine, then stop moving. Go ahead, James. What are you waiting for? - Linda, I love you. - Jim? - God, Linda. - It's not that easy, James. - Don't move, asshole! The rest of you people go back down to your apartments, now! I understand you left quite a mess up there in Big Bear, Mr. Morar. - Duherst, listen. It's not what you think. Listen to me-- - Don't. Miss Brewster, can you stand? - You won't kill her, James. - I can shoot her in the leg. - That won't change anything. - It'll buy us some time. Time to fight you, time for Linda to close the portal. - Only you can do that, James. - Put it down. Put it down! - You're so smart. You haven't figured it out yet, have you, James? You're the portal. Not Linda. You're the one I opened. You're the one I terrorized by torturing Linda and by killing your friends. Linda is mine as long as you live. - Bullshit. Bullshit, you tried to kill me. - No, just to scare you. You're the portal, James. You wanna save Linda? That's right. You've got the means right there in your hands. Go ahead, James. Close the portal. But you won't. You can't. You don't love her that much. Not that much. - Linda. - Is she worth it, James? Is anybody really worth it? Think about it. - Ugh! -Jim, don't! - I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. - Look what I found. - A wee-gee board. Gee, I haven't seen one of these since I was a kid. - I didn't know they've been around that long. - Heh heh. I wonder if it still works. - With all those holes in it? In the middle of the summer In the middle of the night She was deaf from her own heartbeat. Still she heard something move It was just out of sight And the morning was way out of reach Questions may be answered By the light of the day But it's so far away When things go bump in the night Bump in the Night The stairway's a dragon when you turn out the light And things go bump in the Night She's been dreaming of demons Dreaming of fire Dreaming the deluge was near. With so many awoken Like the voice of a child Suddenly nothing was clear Logical conclusions Get harder to make As you lie there awake And things go bump in the night Bump in the night The coat rack's a madman When you turn out the light And things go bump in the night Logical conclusions Get harder to make As you lie there awake And things go bump in the night Bump in the night The stairway's a dragon When you turn out the light And things go bump in the night Bump in the night Bump in the night Bump in the night Bump in the night The stairway's a dragon When you turn out the light And things go bump in the night
