The free birds leaps, on the back of the wind and floats downstream, till the current ends, and dips her wings in the orange sunrays, and dares to claim the sky. But a bird that stalks down her narrow cage can seldom see through her bars of rage. Her wings are clipped, and her feet are tied. So she opens her throat to sing, The caged bird sings with fearful trill of the things unknown, but longed for, still And her tune is heard on a distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom. The free bird thinks of another breeze, and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees. And the fat worms waiting on a dawn- bright lawn and she names the sky her own. But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams Her shadow shouts on a nightmare scream so she opens her throat to sing with the fearful trill of things unknown, but longed for still, and her tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom. Angelou What's wrong? Okay. You're leaving? Is it something I said? If I did something wrong I'm sorry. You okay? I wasn't prepared for this. I didn't think I would find out like this. My life had changed forever. I just want us to make sure that I could never disappoint her. Hey ain't that King's bitch right there? Walk around me it's a choosen fee bitch. You King's bitch right?!

Televison - ...recognize that we have to fight against the rascist myth that the Trump administration is trying to perpetuate. Television - Let's be clear about political retaliation. The Trump administration and ICE have already stated that they are targeting California and targeting sanctuary cities like Oakland. Because of our Political stance. Political retaliation should not be tolerated in a democratic America. Go back to wherever f@%$ you come from lady ... we're honest people out here. Yeah rapists. wherever f@%$ you come from lady ... we're honest people out here. Yeah rapists. How many people have I raped? ... You're a f@%$ piece of shit and explain what I did to you one more time. .... talking fucking stupid Spanish round here when everybody else is an English speaking American. Okay what's happening here is ICE is going out on known information. They know where these individuals are and most over 90% of those that are arrested are those that have previous criminal convictions or are already under ICE proceedings, but absconded from bail or bond. Now, there are about 10% that are collateral arrests and when you go to a house that have felons in there, they arrested felons. There might be some other undocumented aliens that they'll pick up in the process, but 90% are criminal aliens who attack U.S. citizens... Televison - So the mayor of Oakland is saying that basically these illegal immigrants and illegal aliens being rounded up, she's portraying them as innocent. Innocent? They have criminal convictions already. They're the ones that have been released from these prisons instead of being turned over to ICE or returned out to the street. So what does ICE have to do? They have to go to the homes or to the business to find these aliens that could have been picked up at the jail. But that's not what's happening. Politicians like this woman are allowing these aliens back on the street and endangering our citizens, just like the Kate Steinly family. This is an ongoing thing and it needs to be stopped, and it is the sanctuary policies that are doing this. Can you help a brother get some breakfast today? Please Yo man, you got some change bruh? Nah ...Nah man Come on I know you got some money man. I said no nigga! Get your bitch ass out of here! Fake ass Rolex. What Nigga?! We carry tears in our eyes. Goodbye, Father, Goodbye Mother. We carry soil in small bags. We carry carnage of mining, droughts, floods, genocides, we carry dust of our families and neighbors incinerated in mushroom clouds. We carry our islands sinking under the sea. We carry diplomas, medicine, nurse, education, math, poetry, even if they mean nothing to the other shore. We carry railroads, plantations, laundry mats, bodegas, taco trucks, farms, factories, nursing homes, hospitals, schools, temples. We carry old homes along the spine. New dreams in our chests We carry yesterday, today and tomorrow. Were orphans of the wars forced upon us. Were refugees of the sea rising from industrial wastes. And we carry our mother tongues. Hubb, Libe, Amor, Love Ping'an, salaam, shalom, paz, peace Amal, Esperanza, hope, hope hope as we drift in our rubber boats, from shore, to shore, to shore - Wang Ping My family's been in Oakland for over a century. My grandfather used to deal cards in the back alley Chinese casinos up and down the California coast. My father owned Eagle pharmacy, and it was located on the corner of 47th Ave, and East 14th Street. He first started working there fresh out of high school in 1954 after he graduated from Oakland tech. In those days, East Oakland was a white community. In his lifetime it transitioned to become a primarily Black and Latino neighborhood. Sometimes when people look at my face, they assume that I'm not from here. One of the stereotypes that Asian Americans have to confront is the stereotype of being a perpetual foreigner. Regardless of how long our families have been here. I have four generations in this city. I'm super proud to have grown up in Oakland. I feel like Oakland is the place where I have the most roots out of anywhere in the world. Okay. How much is the co-pay? When do you need it by? Yes, I can do that too. Sounds good mam. I send that to you right away. Thank you. Who is that? Nobody important. Where have you been? Working That's good. Listen Dad, I'm not gonna take off for a while. What's wrong? Nothing. Listen, honey. I never meant for it to be like this. Ever since you mother left. I tried my best to support you kids. Hi, um, I'm here to get the keys, I'm sorry to bother you guys, but I need to get the keys. Is there any way he can have some extra time to pack? I suppose so. But.. you know that the new owners are moving in this Friday so I definitely need to get them before then. Sorry, I gotta take this. Hello.. But everything's gonna be okay Mom. E14. It is going to be on the map. Check it out. For real. Young brothers trying to come up. Then gon' come up and they gon' stay up. All their dreams will turn to reality. For real. Let us remember the wasps that hibernated in the walls of this house. Its walls bulged. 20 pounds of wasps And nest. 20 pounds of black knots and buzzing fists. We slept unaware that the wasps slept so near to us. We slept in black comfort, wrapped in our cocoons While death's familiar swarmed unto themselves, but could have swarmed onto us Do not trust cocoons. That's the lesson of this poem. Or this. Luck is beautiful. So let us praise our beautiful white neighbor. Let us write poems for she who found that wasp nest while remodeling the wreck. But let us remember that reck was for five decades, the nest. For a black man and his father. Both men were sick and neglected so they knew how to neglect. But kind death stopped for the father and cruelty left behind the son, who siblings quickly sold the house because it was only a house. For months, that drunken displaced son appeared on our street like a ghost. Distraught. He sat in his car and wept, because nobody else had wept enough for his father, whose ghost took the form of 10,000 wasps. That's the lesson of this poem. Grief is as dangerous and unpredictable as a 20 pound nest of wasps. - Alexie Can I get a bed tonight? What time is it man? Come on. You don't know what I've been through today. Man rules are rules.

I needed a place to sleep where no one would take advantage of me and I was vulnerable. Liberating food became my new priority. Sleep became a luxury.

No, this is bullshit. He's just a kid. When I first met Octavio he was sleeping in the streets. He got beat up all the time. He was sexually abused at the border when he was crossing. I thought I could help him because I was the only one in my job that could speak Spanish. One day, I got a call from his school. He went "5150" in his classroom because he hadn't slept in 10 days. He got deported to a detention center in Arizona. I never saw him again. Labor 2%? Who would have tought? Look cutty. Beyond that alright. I have a question. I need a favor. A favor.
