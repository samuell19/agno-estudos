A SEASON IN FRANCE Madeleine? Dad... What is it? What's wrong, sweetheart? I dreamt of Mummy. You did? She was at the window, smiling at me. I miss her. I miss her too, you know. Dad, do the dead come back one day? No. They never come back. But it's important not to forget them. All right? Uncle Etienne says the dead aren't dead and that they never leave us. It's too late. Come on, go to sleep now, Asma. Can you sing me Mummy's nursery rhyme? All right. Night is coming, my child Come to bed, my child You have played all day And now night has come After work in the fields It's time to rest Night is coming, my child Come to bed, my child If you dream of ghosts Have no fear Your ancestors watch over you And all the family Night is coming, my child Come to bed, my child You sing off-key, Dad. I do? Really off-key. Have a good day, Dad. Have a good day too. Go to sleep. I've made you breakfast. Make sure Asma eats, ok? See you tonight. What happened? I didn't wake up. Hello, Régine. You didn't wait up for me? I did. Everything ok? I'm really sorry. Try texting me. It's Asma. She had a temperature. That'll be 5 euros, ma'am. Hi, Abbas! How's it going? Régine, change for 5. Have a good day. Aspirin in the water will make them last. Thank you. Goodbye. I have mail for you. - Again? - Yes. A letter for Etienne too. Everything ok? - Nothing important? - No. The National Court of Asylum. Did that guy try to pick you up? Stop it. I bet he did. See how he looked at you? Extra custom. Extra custom? Who do you think you are? - We need to get back. - Let's go. Asma, stop wasting water. It costs a lot! I'm nearly done. I'll be out soon. We've been in France 19 months, my sister, Dad, Uncle Etienne and me. We left Bangui 'cause of the war. During our escape, Mum was killed by the militia. In Paris, Dad applied to the OFPRA, the Stateless Persons' Office or something. A judge asked us loads of questions. That'll do. Dad, I don't understand this exercise. I'm coming, Yacine. Clean this up. After a year, they turned Dad down. They rejected our request. After, Dad lodged an appeal with the Court of Asylum. We're waiting for an answer. Omelettes again? I'm sick of them. Mushroom omelette, pumpkin omelette, red pepper omelette... It'll be candy omelettes soon. Do you want ketchup? That won't help. Quick. You're not hungry, is that it? Ok, kids... I have to tell you something. We're not moving again? We are. The man who lent us this place comes back next week. Will we have our own place one day like other people? - We're not like others. - Why d'you say that? I'm not hungry anymore. You just leave the table? Me neither. You neither what? Where're you going? I'm going to feed Bing. Who's Bing? The goldfish... Want dessert? I have some great pears. You said you knew people in France who'd welcome us. You lied to us. Go on, go to bed now. Go to bed! Good night, Dad. Good night, Dad. I love you. Dad has changed in France. In Bangui, he was cooler. Dad taught French at Barthélémy Boganda High. Etienne... A pizza for the kids. No need to bring food every day. Come on, take it. How's it going? Ok. Go to the living room. - Where are the kids? - In bed. Uncle Etienne taught philosophy to students in the final year. Want to eat something? No, thanks. - You're sure? - Yes. I've brought you books. Ignoramus. This is good. How are things? - They're ok. - You're sure? I have something for you. Do you know this? Wow... Trying to beat me? It'll warm my long winter nights. It looks good. - Shall we catch him? - No. All right then. Hi, how are you? Your wife's dead, Abbas. It's time you moved on. You have to learn to live. For the kids. For you. For us. I'm sorry. Madeleine's still in my mind, as if she'd never gone. But I'm here. I'm here and I'm alive. I know. I know. I'm very fond of you too. I need you. To help chase away my ghosts. Sit here, I'll sit behind. That's kind, thank you. COURT OF ASYLUM I need the bathroom. A real father would have his papers. Go to sleep now. Good night, Asma. Good night, Dad. Good night, Yacine. - Hello, Etienne. - Hello, Carole. - How are you? - I should ask you that. I'll leave you. I'm not chasing you off? No, don't be silly. I have to go anyway. It'll be ok. See you later? Abbas. Hold on, I'll walk him back. Carole, you're here? - Has Uncle Etienne left? - Yes. Pity, I wanted to see him. Go to sleep now, Asma. I can't. - You can't get to sleep? - No. Are you worried? Shall I sing you a song? It's a song my mum sang to me when I was 7. I love this song. It's called A Little Red Dog. All right. A little red dog Was bored out of his mind He set off to find A magician To tell him about His life as a dog I'm tied up All day long Beneath a tall pine That rains down Pinecones on me What a din Give me wings Like a bird in flight And I shall fly up high In the blue sky Among the birds The colour of fire Are you ok? I had problems, so I didn't call. It's been a week. I'm sorry. You're sorry, but... What do I do? Wait for you? I worry? You could've texted me. Hold on. This is to apologize. What is it? Open it. A papaya... - No, thanks. - Come on. Want some wine? What are you doing? Nothing. Stop it. You don't want me anymore? I don't get you hard? Know what, Martine? I'm finished. I'm impotent. I'm no use to anyone. If there's someone else, say so. You've never really loved me. What're you doing? There's work to be done. Start unloading the goods. What's on your mind? What are you doing? You're fired! Is this it? Here you are. Come on, children. Come in. Here's the crockery. All you need: forks, plates, glasses. Light. On it goes. Here, heating radiator. It's hot. Very, very hot water. The cross. This is sacred. Don't touch. Leave it there. The French window... The garden... A table for cooking. Here... Washbasin. A cabinet with a mirror... For all your things. - Where's the toilet? - On the landing. There. Come on. I'll show you. All this is temporary. We'll have a big apartment one day, with a bedroom each. You swear? Yes. I swear. A big place like in Bangui? Cool! I want my room to be white and gold. With... books, lots of books. Lots of dolls. And a mezzanine bed. A huge one. With a slide down from it. How would you want your room? Yacine, how would you want your room? Blue like Paris St Germain. I knew he'd say that. With posters, soccer boots, a ball and a computer. No game console? No. Well, yes, a PS4. And the posters? Neymar? Messi? Griezmann? Zlatan! Zlatan's not with Paris anymore. So? - Take that! - He "Zlataned" you! Hello. Happy birthday. Thank you. - Happy birthday, Carole. - Thank you, honey. - Here. - Fantastic. How was your day? It was fine. You weren't cooking all day? No. I'm glad they're here. A second. A second? Thank you. Let's open it. By the way... Recorded delivery. Children... I've bought candy. Awesome! Excellent! Not opening it? I don't want to know. Today, we celebrate. The candle... Blow it out! One... Two... Three! She blew two out! That's great. The champagne... I'm tipsy already... How old are you? 73. 73 is great. That way, see... people say, "You look younger!" This is my mum's recipe. It's a Polish cake. There are apples, lots of cream 'cause the Poles like cream... How did you meet? Don't be so curious. Asma, that's enough. Sorry. It's ok, you can tell her. All right... Here we go. One glass. Ladies first. Champagne? It looks good. Thanks, Yacine. I hope it's not too... No, it's ok. You took some candy. I'll add this. All done? A toast. To us! To all of us. I love the headband. - Which one first? - Any one. This is the most visible. Very pretty. Are they flowers? Very, very pretty. - No kiss? - Wait till she opens it. Hold on, I haven't opened it. Delicious. It is? I'll try it too. Mama's cake. Mama... It is good! - Lovely! - What is it? It's about plants. - Great! - Wonderful. Thank you. You're welcome. Now yours. The last one! Suspense... It's beautiful. That's true. You chose it together? The lovebirds! Stop being silly. - You have to wear it. - Yes. Let me do it. What's so funny? Nothing. We'll manage it. Don't strangle me. "In view of the European Convention of Human Rights, in view of the code of asylum rights, and notably of the prefecture's ruling, it is decided... Article 1: Mr Abbas Mahadjir's appeal to the Court of Asylum is rejected. Article 2: Mr Mahadjir has 30 days to leave France from the date of this ruling. Article 3: After 30 days, Mr Mahadjir can be deported to his country of origin, the Central African Republic, or any other host country. Article 4: From the date of this ruling, Mr Mahadjir must surrender his passport to the police and sign on with them once a week." - Ok? - Yes. What have you picked? That's good. Asma, no, that's too many. Not that one... You can only pick six. - I want that one. - Ok. - But you've already read it. - No. The Promise. His grandmother promised him to find a land... of hunters. Your papers, I said. I think that's him. Finished your homework? I don't want to do it. Enjoy. It's good. What's wrong? Don't cry. We didn't leave any for Dad. That's ok. Come and see. - Know him? - No. Etienne! What's going on? You never answer. Shit... Fuck... MIGRANTS OUT There's no place for us in France. We have to leave. Where would we go, Abbas? Our country's gone. Central Africa is just an illusion. Africa is an illusion. Don't exaggerate. I'm staying. I'm not leaving. You prefer illegality and humiliation? Is that it? I'll do security to survive. Any port in a storm. Security once, security forever. Our dignity is all we have left. - Don't lose it, Etienne. - That's enough. Go now. I won't leave you like this. Where will you sleep? Just go, Abbas. Cut the crap now. Come and stay with us. Go, I said! It's cramped, but we'll manage. No. Thank you. Come on. Shit, leave me alone. I don't need your help. Get lost. Go! Go, I said! Ready? Lift. Let's go. Yes, come in. I don't even know where he lives. He said he shared a room in a Malian hostel. Is that true? Yes, it's true. Where? In the 18th district... No, the 20th. Yes, the 20th. He wouldn't take me there. Good evening. I'm not pleased with you. I'm sorry, Thammah. I promise I'll pay next week. I don't trust you now, Mr Abbas. You're leaving. You have to leave, you haven't paid. What'll I do? I need the money. You can't do this. My children. I promise I'll pay next week. I promise. You leave. You can't do this, Thammah. You can't do it. Please, Thammah. Please, Mr Thammah. We'll pick a country. A country where they won't throw us out. What about school? We stop going? I'd like to finish the year. Dad, the North Pole. That's good. There's snow and polar bears too. There's no one there. Australia's better. It's by the sea too. Chad. Bangui is just below it. Brazil, with the Rio carnival... Argentina, where they make Chica Vampiro. Or Morocco. It's sunny. Or Spain. Not Spain. The USA. New York. Alaska. Canada. Are there Mongols in Mongolia? Stop it... Hello. How are you? Come in. Give me your bag. Let me help you. Don't worry. It'll be ok. Come on. Is that enough? Does he have a name? - What's he called? - Bing. Nice name. Are you hungry? - Yes. - No. You're hungry? Do you want... a biscuit? No, Yacine, we've already eaten. It's ok, if he wants one. Call this place home. Be comfortable. It's tiny, but we'll manage. Where do we sleep? On the couch. It turns into a bed. That's cool. Where does Dad sleep? With me. You mean, in... Yes, Asma. We sleep in the same bed. Come here. Curious, aren't you? You don't mind? Carole's my girlfriend. Got a boyfriend? Isn't it Elias? Yes. You see. What's his name? Elias? - Got a girlfriend? - No. - Why not? - Don't want one. With your pretty eyes... You don't want one? Finish school first. You're laughing? Give Carole a kiss. Go on, Asma, catch him! Now we have to catch them. I don't like that. Stop it. I'm enjoying it. We're good here. What if we got married? I don't have my papers. Who's that now? Stop it. Just a second. What? What's wrong? Uncle Etienne was buried in Thiais. In the garden of fraternity. It used to be the potters' field. There's a 5-year limit on graves. The social worker told us. After 5 years, we'll need to find him another grave. If not, he'll be cremated. They'll burn him and put his ashes in a jar. I'm sad for him. At home, we don't burn the dead. That's it. The 30 days are up. We're undocumented. There's one last chance. The administrative court. Have faith. Have faith. I ended up undocumented once. For three years, they wouldn't renew my passport. They demanded a certificate of nationality from my parents. Stop that. It's going to work. It's going to work. Are you ok? What're you doing? Praying? Are you ok? What's wrong? Look at me. Are you ok? It's ok. Police! Open up! I'm coming! Go in the kitchen. Open up! Police! I'm coming! Don't move. Good morning. A routine check, ma'am. You are Carole Balzac? Blaszac. Yes, that's me. What's wrong? Does Mr Abbas Mahadjir live here? No, not at all. I don't know where he lives. I gave him my address so he could receive his mail. To help him. Do you know Abbas Mahadjir well? No, not really. When did you last see him? I don't know... Last week maybe. He should have left France. He's had an OLFT. An OLFT? An Order to Leave French Territory. Has he left? I've no idea. Didn't he lodge an appeal with the administrative court? No, ma'am. If you know anything about him, tell us. I know nothing. Apart from what I just told you. Assisting an illegal can bring 5 years' imprisonment and a 30,000-euro fine. Article L-622, paragraph 1. Come to the station today to make a statement. All right. Goodbye, ma'am. Why didn't you appeal? Why? Forgive me. I'll see the cops. I've done nothing wrong. We won't go to jail? No, don't worry. We'll work it out. I love you, Carole. I don't want to cause you trouble. Carole, honey... You took me into your heart, which I keep carefully. May God continue to shine His Grace on you. I'm vanishing today. But a trace of our fleeting lives will remain. No one can erase our moments of happiness, nor the memories we have made and that belong to us. They give me strength now. We left with heavy hearts. To go where? I don't know. I trust the wind that blows where it wants. It will carry us. I ask myself, will history repeat itself like in 1938 at the Evian Conference? Democracies refused to open their doors to Jewish migrants. They said they had reached "saturation point". It's not nice feeling undesirable. Carole, I'm leaving to give my children a peaceful future, far from this Europe that has become a Tower of Babel. If I were a pessimist, I'd say like Jacques the Fatalist that everything is written on high. But I don't believe that. For me, every man can write his own story. Mine is made invisible. It's impossible to relate. Someone will tell it one day, I'm sure. For nothing is final. As long as I still stand, as long as my children and I keep walking, there'll always be a star shining for us somewhere. Hello. Ma'am... Everything ok? Can I help you? Looking for someone or something? Was this the Calais jungle? Yes. They finished razing it two days ago. Are you with a charity? A reporter? No one's left? No, even the women and children were forced out. Looking for someone? I'm looking... for the man I love. That's them? The children's centre could help if it was still open. I can't help you. Did they apply for asylum? What nationality was the gentleman? Subtitles by Ian Burley
