LONESOME DOVE CHURCH Subrip: Pix - What'd you do that for? - Spider. You got a problem with spiders? I don't like 'em. What're you gonna do with your share of the money? Well, I just assumed get through takin' it before I start thinkin' about spendin' it. Yeah, I'ma find me a sweetie. Move her to heaven. Heaven on Earth. - Yeah? Where's that? - Grapevine. Grapevine, Texas. Thick with game, thin with the law. I've been to Grapevine. Yeah, just about the best place on Earth. Stop your yappin'. It's comin'. Are you sure about this? It's Henley's money we're talkin' about here. I know whose money it is. Get out there. Render a reward to the proud. Lord, how long shall the wicked triumph? You are in the process of being separated from your cargo. Kindly exit the stage with said cargo and place your hands above... Isaac! Help, Isaac! You killed him. - You know who that is? - Was. Was, right. You killed Henley's son. Well, he shouldn't have let his kid join the family business. I didn't see anything. He's seen our faces. Well, if he didn't see our faces, he sure as hell heard you screamin' my name. I swear, I didn't hear nothin'. Idiot. You know I don't like being called names. I didn't see or hear anything. - I... honest. - Sure, you didn't. I'll never say a word, sir. I swear to you. I... I got children. We can't take any chances. No, no, no. Accountants always keep their word, don't they? Yeah, that's right. We sure do, accountants. Always. All right, you're free to go. - Nah. - Hey! What are you doin'? No. Well, now he's gonna go talk to Henley. Who's the idiot? 965... - ...66... - 194... should be 195. You made me lose my count again. Well, you can count it tomorrow. Hey, you should smoke some of this opium that Henley was so gracious to donate to the cause. I ain't touchin' that. Suit yourself. More for me. We should finish those bottles. God. I think I might already be a bit... Drunk. You know I don't like being called names. Come on, buddy. Celebrate! Right? Thank you, ladies. Good morning. I would like to talk to you today about a subject we discuss far too rarely. We cannot stand by idly while the great evil of slavery tears our nation asunder. How can we, as good Christians, champion a practice that is the opposite of fairness and decency? That... That is not the Bible I know. Enjoy your Sabbath. Young Sarah, always good to see you. Look forward to our invitation for supper next week. Pastor Simmons, did you enjoy the sermon today? Did I enjoy your sermon? Yes. No, sir, I did not enjoy your sermon in the least. I specifically asked you to moderate your more unusual views. Well, I felt the topic was relevant... It's my intention to bring people into this congregation, not drain it with divisive talk and controversial opinions. But relevant to our calling. Our calling? What do you know of calling, circuit preacher? Ma'am. Wait for me, Nancy. Pastor, a word? I'm sorry, but I feel you unjustly berated me in front of... You're lucky I didn't walk up to the pulpit, bullwhip you out of this church and into the street. Perhaps I should just find another church. You'll forever be known in these parts as a Negro-lovin' preacher. You'll never get another job preachin' in this state and I'll see to it. You disgust me. Do not step one foot into this vestibule again, and that goes for that trollop you call a wife. I'd adjust your tone! You in your heart are a violent man. I picked this up at the post office. Like father, like son. You can take that with you. I've never seen you carve so intently. I suppose I should thank the good Lord for finding it in His providence to put so much soft pine on the Earth. What happened with the pastor this morning? We... had a parting of the ways. Well... this is just a bump in the road. You'll see. I have a bigger problem, though. Look at this. Nancy. I need to get my boy back to the Lord. He's beyond your help. - It's never too late. - He's committed murder! What can you do that you haven't already tried? Well, you might speak differently if it was your own flesh and blood. I have to do something. What? So you can be be an accomplice to his murders? I just need to do something right by my son. Well, if you leave, I will be on the first stage to St. Louis. I won't be long, I swear it. It's not too late for you to change your mind. He's my son, Nancy. I'm your wife! Hup, hup! Giddyup. Hup. "And the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said, 'Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?'" Howdy. Just leave everything be and we'll pretend this never happened. You some kind of preacher, ain't ya? I knew you was when I see you prayin'. Explains why you got two Bibles and no money. Nice talkin' with ya, preacher man. Get off the wagon. Get off the wagon! How'd you find me? Last seen in this county. I always did like this place. Have a seat, John. Still playin' a preacher man, I see. The Lord guided me here to you. I have no doubt of this. The Lord guided you here? I always wondered when this moment would come to pass. I wanted to have a word with you, son. Son? I want to make amends. Amend away. I... lost my position back home. My views were seen by some as... extreme, and I need to start afresh. We don't get to just start fresh. It ain't that simple. I want to build a church of my own, and I need you to change your ways and help me build that church. You see, me and Jesus, we got some issues. Thanks, but, no, thanks. How are you gonna end up if things like this go on? You gonna ask me? Did you do what they said you did? Things didn't turn out the way I'd intended. Isaac. How can you be so cavalier about these men's lives? About as cavalier as you were with mine. Who's this fellow Henley that's offering the reward? I ain't afraid of Henley. All right? All this means is I gotta keep on movin'. Nothin' new. And I am not joinin' the family business. End of story! - I... - I have nothin' left to say to you. Now, you should leave before I lose my patience. That's him. Pistols on the table, Mr. Shepherd. Stay back. Come on, come on, sit down. That was for my boy. He shouldn't have been doing your dirty work. Best person to guard your valuables is your own blood. This establishment is rife with sin! Makes me sick. Right. I remember a girl, - pretty young thing... - Don't. ...hair as red as a sunrise on a Christmas morning. But in the end, she was a sinner. Far too many sins to mention. - Poor Margie. - Don't you say her name! You just don't quit, do ya? - Where's my money? - I'm gonna kill you! That's the spirit. Where's my money? I spent it. I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Why don't you let me go fetch it and I'll bring it back? Ye who spareth his rod. I want his head on a pole! Now! What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doin'? Looks like you're stealing my wagon. - Your wagon? - That's right, my wagon. I'm afraid you're mistaken, I stole it from that gentlemen over there. - He dead? - Just sleepin'. Shoot! Do not look towards me. I said don't look! Look, I... I had a change of heart. Really? Yes, sir. I am ready to stand by your side, preachin' the gospel of the good Lord for the world to see. And this wouldn't have anything to do with those gentlemen lookin' around the back of the saloon, now, would it? Maybe just a little somethin'. Perhaps that preacher with the sidearm? Maybe. Look, why didn't you just ride on out? He's got men all over the edges of town. Well, son, there are no Christian thieves. So if you're gonna ride out with me, you're gonna have to change your ways. - You understand? - Yes, sure, fine. Okay, that's one year of preaching with me, take it or leave it. - A whole year? - All right, suit yourself. You can deal with that Henley fellow. Just till we get to the edge of town. Six months. Looks like trouble ahead. One year or I'm pullin' back that tarp. - A year. - Your word! My word. Good morning, my brothers in Christ. And, what a glorious morning it is! Long as you got your hands in the air, best keep 'em up. We're... looking for someone. You seen him? No, sir. No. Good. You wouldn't mind if we, searched your wagon? Well, ordinarily I'd be agreeable, but I have a long road ahead of me, and I'd like to get there before nightfall. I can assure you your vile rogue is not in my wagon. You really a preacher? Yes, I, spent over 30 years preaching the praises of the Good Book. Backwards and forwards. All right, give me your Bible. What? Come on, give it over. If you truly can quote any verse I pick, I'll let ya pass. Here you go. Matthew 20:28. "Just as the son of man did not come to serve... ...but to serve and give his life a ransom for the many." I'm impressed. Martelo. It's your lucky day. Why did you choose the book of Matthew? No reason, just went to Matthew 'cause that's my name. Matthew was a dishonest tax collector full of greed. But then Jesus picked him as a disciple. He spent the rest of his life saving souls for Christ. I've done my share of helping souls leave this earthly place, and if you don't want yours leavin' next, you best be on your way. Hyah. Hup, hup! Well, I hope you find your worthless scum. Adios. Stop, stop, stop, stop. What? We should ditch this here. They'll be lookin' for a man with a wagon. - You think? - Yeah. Let's go. All right, I guess you're right. Where you fixin' on buildin' this church? Somewhere in Missouri. Where that woman of yours is? She left me, went back to St. Louis. She's kinda sore about me leavin' to find you and... she really didn't think you were worth all the effort. Well, she's a smart woman. You know, I was thinkin' Missouri is one of the first places Henley will come lookin' for me. Well, he found me in Nacogdoches didn't he? Someplace further out on the frontier might be a safer bet. You can always call for your wife once we're settled. Any place in particular you have in mind? Little town called Grapevine. Lots of game and souls need to be guided to the Lord. From what I hear. From what you hear. Yeah. Pass me the rope. I'll give ya $4.00 for that hat. Told you I ain't sellin' it. Besides, it'll never fit. - I ain't gon' wear it. - Nope? No. I'm gonna give it to my girlfriend. That's enough outta you. What? It's a pretty hat. - Say that again. - It's a pretty hat. - Say it again. - It's a pretty hat. Would you stop sayin' that? You're tellin' me to say, "It's a pretty hat." Don't tell you I'm... Any activity today? Not much, sir. A couple road agents,... couple fellas on a horse, medicine show, - preacher, a buggy come along... - Hold. Circuit preacher? Could be, he had a buck board and everything. - Did you search it? - I didn't see no need. Just full of his preachin' supplies. Preachin' supplies. Preachin' supplies, what might those be? I don't know... a Bible, I guess. Bible. That's good. What else? Bible stuff. What if I told you that Shepherd's daddy was a circuit preacher? How would information like that make you feel? Well, I'd be hoping you were just funnin' with me. Do I look like I'm just funnin' with ya? Well, I couldn't have known. Besides, buggy come along just after full of rich people headed up north. We got $35, Sanchez got your share. What about my share? I'm gonna give you a week to find the preacher and his son. What if we don't find 'em? I guess it's a week's head start. George, let's get him outta here. You only thought to pack one can of beans? Just be grateful for what the Lord provides. Tell you what. Let's have a little shootin' contest. See who gets the rest of the beans. First one to hit this tin. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? Well, I haven't been a circuit preacher all my life, son. Tell me something. Did you know you were robbin' this Henley fellow? Yeah. Why did you kick his hornet's nest? I don't care for how the man makes his money. He's done things to people I cared about. Robbin' him makes you better? Listen, I spend my time lightening the burden of folks that got too much. And that's how you do the Lord's work. I don't know, but it's how I do my work. See, your problem is you've always believed the garbage you were peddlin'. I'm not peddling anything. You make it sound like I'm selling hats. And I certainly don't do it for the money. Amen to that! 'Cause you certainly didn't do it for your kin, either. I freely admit that I have an avarice for bringing wayward people back to the Lord. And that got in the way of my being a good father. I regret that, Isaac. I do. I remember when you were, what, five years old, maybe. I came back into town from preachin' in a couple of churches and got home... and there you were, just a little fella. You were preachin' a sermon to your toys. That's a dandy story. Like much of your preachin', it's nothin' more than a fable. Stinkin' birds. We're wastin' our time walkin' through these woods. We ain't gon' find him. Now, which way? What kind of path is this? God damn it, sticks. Again? Sick of it. John, get your gun! Were highwaymen out to rob us? I think this is one of the men from Nacogdoches. I hurt somethin' awful. Hey, how 'bout a... slug of some whiskey if you got it? How many of you are there? It's just the three of us. I swear. Now, you wouldn't be lyin' to me, would you? No, please. Just ease me into the other side. Just a taste. Much obliged. Does Henley know you're here? No, but I figure the fellas'll tell him. Hey, Preacher. You really memorize that whole Bible? I just happen to know the book of Matthew by heart. What if, back there, I'd asked you to recite somethin' from the book of Luke? Well, then, I guess I'm lucky because your name was Matthew and not Luke. Any chance I could... convince you to put in a good word for me? Matthew, Matthew. There were two thieves that died with Christ on Mount Calvary. One of them regretted his crimes and was pardoned and personally promised, by Christ, to join him in paradise. But, Matthew... the other one wasn't. I never liked hurting people. I was just doin' it for the money. And women. I know that ain't right. Matthew... do you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior? Son, please speak up, please. I do. Truly, I do. Lord, we ask that You forgive this man of all his sins and that You cleanse his soul with the spirit of Jesus Christ. Amen. May God bless your soul. He'll send more men. We should get movin'. Looks like a good knife. - What? - What?! Rabbit. Rabbit? Missed it. How you feelin'? I'm fine. Good enough to whittle. Whatcha makin'? It hasn't revealed itself to me yet. You see, the grain of the wood talks to you. It lets you know what it intends to be. Haven't I taught you this already? Before? No, sir. I'da remembered some kind of nonsense like that. You know, Michelangelo, the sculptor, he said that there was always something inside a block of marble. Well, if that's what Michelangelo said. Yeah, and his job was to free it from its prison. I figure, wood is much the same way. Circuit preaching wasn't easy, but it paid the bills. I had no idea your ma was so sick. You coulda come home after you found out. I know, Isaac. I'm sorry. I miss her, too. Tell me something. This Henley fellow, what did he do to you? There was a woman. She was very special to me. He brought her in from the city and got her crazy on the opium. His opium. Turned her into a prostitute. She was hooked. I tried to buy her out, but he wouldn't let her quit. I found her hung in her room. I am truly sorry for your pain, Isaac. This man is seriously compromising my labor pool. He is toying with me like Satan did with Job. You know the story of Job? We really gotta teach you boys how to read. Come on! We've got our work cut out for us. If Peter could start the church in Rome and get a foothold in that den of debauchery, surely we can plant the seed that will take root here in Grapevine. Well, if you say so. Hey... let me buy you a drink. It'll calm your nerves. I don't know. I... I don't... Come on. You comin'? Two whiskey. You keep lookin' at me like that, I'm never gonna stop smilin'. Well, to the... end of one journey and the start of the next. May the Lord bless us in this endeavor. Amen to that. Still think you're better than everyone else, John? Well, I'm gonna talk to some of these patrons, try to get a lay of the land. Hello, I'm new in town and lookin' for some work. - Thank you. - Yeah? Okay. Interesting conversation. Come to find a good friend of mine's in town. I'm of the mind to pay him a visit. - I ain't payin' extra. - Woman: It ain't extra. Forget it. You had your fun, now you have to pay. I told you, I ain't payin'. Well, you're a thief. And I don't like bein' called names. And now I'm gonna change the way you look permanent. Drop the knife. You, outta here. I can explain. Don't want your explanations. I want my money. I don't have it. I mean, I don't have it on me. Isaac, what is goin' on here? Dutch, this here's my dad, John Shepherd. Dutch and I used to do a little business together. In fact, we were just closin' on some unfinished commerce. Dutch owes me some money. What we decide it was, Dutch? $500? Where's the rest of it, Dutch? It's gone, I don't have it. Does this have anything to do with that Henley character? - How much is this? - I don't know. Maybe a hundred? What'd you blow it on? Well, what you think? Hookers and opium? Well, yeah, mostly. And my new belt, too. I had plans for that money. You're not... you're not killing this man. - No. - Killing? What? I didn't do this for you to kill another man. I got you out of that town and now you owe me. This... Your pa the preacher? - No kiddin'. - Shut up. If you're gonna hold this over me the rest of my days, you shoulda just let me die. No, you promised me one year. Okay. My debt is paid. Nancy, he is a man of great promise, great creativity. A man who has a moral compass. A compass that is sadly and profoundly off of true north. I fear that I have failed him more than I would even admit to the Lord. I failed him as a child and I failed him as a man. I have forsaken him as I have forsaken you, a decision that I will regret until my dying day. Love, John. Excuse me, I was wondering if I might speak with the proprietor here? You're lookin' at him. Well, I'm new in town lookin' for work and I was hoping that you hadn't already taken someone on for the position. See that pile of wood? I need to get all that cut down to size. Well, I've worked with wood all my life, I'm good with lathes and things like that. Name's Charles. Charles Stone. John Shepherd. Well, John, I can't pay much. - Don't need a lot. - When can you start? I can start right now. Hey, John. John! - Let's take a break. - Thank you. You're a hard worker. "Whatever you do, work heartily, as if for the Lord, not for men." What? It's, from the book of Colossians. Great. So, what brings you to Grapevine? I'm a preacher by trade. I want to build a church here. A church. - Here in Grapevine. - Yes. You are indeed an ambitious man. Where you stayin'? I booked a room at the local hotel. Hotel ain't no home. Any man brave enough to try and build a church in Grapevine shouldn't be homeless. I'll give you food and a roof over your head if you'll put in a hard day's work me every day. That's all a man can ask for. You know I've been thinkin' about you every day. It's true. - I'll bet. - I came back here for you. You came back here for me, did ya? It isn't nothin' to do with what Dutch took from you? Now that hurts. Are you ready to come away with me? I still have no intention of takin' up with a gambler and a drinker and who knows what else. This is just a temporary situation, Angie, all right? I've been met with some business setbacks and I've been cursed with the ability of a cardsharp. Cardsharp indeed. Look, when I've rebuilt my bankroll, enough to reestablish my business... Build it how and for what business? Well, they don't let fellas like me practice medicine and work in banks, darlin'. Nah, fellas like you wind up in banks for other reasons. You know you missed me. You gotta earn straight, or I can't keep seein' ya. All right. Let's cut the cards. I win, you come away with me. No cheatin'. Best two outta three. John, let's knock it off for the day. Those planks are still gonna be there for you tomorrow. - Here. - Appreciate it. You know, couple more months, I should have enough to buy a plot of land for the church. I've got somethin' I'd like to show ya. Unless you've got somethin' else goin' on. I believe I do have some free time. So, what do you think? What happened? The old hotel burnt down a couple of years back. New hotel's doin' so well, it didn't make sense rebuildin' this one here. So what do you think? About what? Is this place big enough to build your church? I don't know what to say, Charles. Don't want ya to say anything. I want you to build us a church. So I've never really read one of these "Farmer's Almanacs" before, - but somewhere in here... - Isaac. ...it talks about the moon. I know you can hear me, son. John, what a pleasure to see you. No, no, no. I did not trek all these miles through swamps and bandit gangs to see you throw your life away again with a tramp like this. Come on. Come on. You don't get to walk away from me, son. You hear me? I know you're in there, son. Open the door. Open up, son. Please, I don't... What? May I come in? I'd like to apologize. She's the one that deserves the apology. I'm off to work. He's not outta here in 10 minutes, you have my permission to shoot him. Ma'am, I am truly sorry for my disparaging remarks and... passing judgment upon you in a most grievous manner. Mr. Shepherd, I expected more of a gentleman. And I expected more of myself, too. I am sorry, ma'am. Call me Angie. Angie, I'm truly sorry. Please, feel free to have a seat. Nathan, sweetheart, why don't you go play? He's a good-lookin' boy. Isaac's been like a father to that boy since the day we met. He's loved him as his own. Isaac helped me outta a bit of a bad spot. Got me a job as a faro dealer at the saloon. I don't think I'll ever truly be able to repay him for what he's done to help me and my son. Can I get you some coffee? That'd be very kind of you. What happened to the boy's father? - There you go. - Thank you. He was shot in a gambling hall in New Orleans. Now, before you get to feelin' sorry for him, he was precisely the type of man who deserved to meet his end that way. Isaac's lost someone he loved, too. But I'm sure you know all about that. Well, I really should be going. Will we see you again, Mr. Shepherd? I certainly hope so, Angie. I'll see myself to the door. I better get goin' before he comes back and shoots me. Good-bye, Mr. Shepherd. I know you're not here for the bourbon. No, I came to get something to eat. What are you doing? Workin' the bar. What's got you bothered? Isaac... you love Angie? I do. And if she wanted nothin' to do with you, what would you do? Only thing I could. I am a coward. Read that. I can't even screw up the courage to send a letter to tell her how much I love her. Isaac, Angie seems like a great gal. She does at that. And I... I shamed myself the way I treated her. You know, there's this old preacher who once told me, "It's never too late for redemption." Good morning, Angie. Mr. Shepherd. When I said I hoped to see you soon, I couldn't have imagined it would be so... soon. Yes. well, I couldn't help but notice last night that your house is somewhat drafty and I don't think a draft would be real good for little Nathan. Isaac says you're a preacher. I am, by the grace of God. I used to attend church all the time when I lived back East. Did ya? Well, I shan't be a bother. Progress is slow. But you've made progress, nonetheless. You could use my old barn to preach in the meantime if it moves you. It's no palace by any stretch, but you're welcome to it. I'm most grateful to you. Thank you. Guessin' your church is gonna need a new name. Yeah. Did you know that doves, they mate for life? When their mate dies, they fly aimlessly and endlessly forever. I am so pleased with the turnout. The prospect of food always helps guide an audience to a man of the cloth. I trust you are right. My brethren, if I may. I must say that I am reminded of the ancient Israelites when they dined on the fishes and the loaves of bread at the Sermon on the Mount and how they must have felt much like us, with the same fellowship. So if we could perhaps bow our heads and pray. Lord, we give thanks for this opportunity to worship you in this, the first service of the Lonesome Dove Church. How did you find me? When God told Jonah to go to Nineveh, he boarded a ship bound for Tarshish instead. The opposite direction. He wanted to escape the presence of the Lord. Do you think he succeeded? Yes? No. Yes?! The answer is, no, he did not. So, why am I telling you this story? So I don't try and run? Because, Dutch, to you, I am God. All right! Okay. He's in Grapevine. Grapevine, Texas. I hear he got a job at a saloon. Okay? You wouldn't be lyin' to me, now, would you, boy? No, sir. I'm serious. Serious as sin. I know a little about sin. It's curious how people look when they die with your name and cherubic ill will. Will ya still look that way as you travel down to the valley of darkness? What a glorious day for our Lonesome Dove Church. Our congregation keeps growing, and I am joined most unexpectedly by my wife Nancy, recently arrived from Missouri. Welcome. Sit over here. Please. Hi, is here okay? You are not letting that whore into this church! First of all, she is not a prostitute. And second, did you read the sign outside of our church? "All are welcome." Either this harlot leaves, or I do. If anyone else wishes to leave, please do so now. You see, in God's eyes, we are all equal. Men, women, sinners, and saints. And this church shall never, never turn anyone away. Let's continue on. Turn to... How's the leg? Hurts when a storm's comin'. Hands. I'm afraid we're closed. Is that right, Isaac? That's not gonna end well, gentlemen. It's all right, boys. Why don't you get along? These are just some old friends of mine. That's good advice. Find him. Let me in! What's goin' on? Henley. - How'd he find you? - I don't know, Dutch probably. I don't know what to do. I got an idea. Pull that rug up, there's a trapdoor. Root cellar. - I ain't hidin'. - Trust me. You have no idea what he's capable of, all right? - You don't know him! - I think I have a pretty good idea. Dad! We have come too far to lose everything. Trust me on this. You think there's spiders down there? Great. - If anything happens... - Have a little faith. These women had no part in this. Let 'em go. We're lookin' for your son. Word has it that he left town, headed west. Well, despite your pedigree, Mr. Shepherd, I do not believe you. We'd like to search your house. Well, I do not give you permission. Well, let me rephrase that. You won't find anything. We should find out soon enough. Isaac Shepherd is no relation to me. Not anymore. He's fallen from grace. This is indeed a confusing dichotomy. The righteous, upstanding minister and his murderous scum of a son. Where did things go so wrong? Well, what about you? Why are you still wearing the clothes of a man of the cloth? You ever read the Bible, friend? It's about the most violent book there is. I just stopped ignorin' all the good parts. You come all the way to Grapevine to set things right. I got news for you. Bad news. It's not gonna end well. Well, I had my chance. He was a boy and I failed him. Well, you can rest assured when I find him, I shall reap my vengeance upon him, and I shall do so with a mighty fury! I know you know where he is. So you bring him out here to me, or these nice young ladies are gonna end up six feet under. I cannot produce my son for you. I ask you, as another man of the cloth, to listen to these words of our Lord, please. Let no one doubt your devotion, John. "Rescue the weak and the needy. Deliver them from the hands of the wicked." Amen. These folks mean well, but they don't know an awl from a hole in the ground. Charles, you know I am a firm believer that all good things come to... Look. Come on, come on up. - What can we do? - We got plenty of work. Trust me. God bless you, everyone.
