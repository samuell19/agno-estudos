[music] [dramatic music] [overlapping voices] [music] [nature sounds] [crunching] [laughter] Class from now on, we will be having an English-only policy during my class. If you hear someone speaking in Kapampangan, I want you to strike his or her ear three times. Understood? Yes, Ma'am. Ma'am. As students of this institution, It gives the school a very bad image! Are we clear, Barriotic Gang? For the rest of the period, I want you to put your chairs at the back. Go! Those who brought their English journals, kindly raise them up. Very good, very good. Mr. Salonga. What is that drawing on the cover of your journal? Omegaboy, Ma’am. Omegaboy? That’s the favorite cartoon of my son. It’s not a cartoon, Ma’am. Kindly keep your journals. To everyone who did not bring their English journals, please fall in line. Starting today, I want you to write entries in your journal. One day, one entry. All in English. You will submit your journal by the end of the grading period. Understood? Yes, Ma’am. [bell rings] [music] June 11. I am in a conundrum. This is the first time an assignment has stumped me. It’s not my fault I’m stuck with these unremarkable individuals in this forlorn school. Cult! What? They're scary. What? They... cut heads! They was... What? [chatter] A consequence of being a school top-notcher is not having friends. But I'm not disconsolate. I've never encountered anyone worth befriending. This school sucks, bro. Excluded of course in this group, are? The Untouchables. [knocking] Class. Good afternoon, Principal Patio. Good afternoon. II-Sampaguita, I would like to introduce your new classmate, Magnus Snyder. He’s a transferee from another school in Pampanga. [shushes, laughter] Good afternoon, classmate. Hi. Mr. Snyder, can you introduce yourself to your classmates? [clears throat] Hi, my name is Magnus Snyder. I’m 17 years old. I have a little brother that goes here as well. His name is Maxim and he’s a year younger than me. My father’s American and my mom’s from Visayas. I forgot where. Sorry. Is that all? - Yeah. - Okay. Goodbye, Principal Patio. Snyder, you sit beside Spencer. [chatter] [shushes] Alright, class, let’s go back to our lesson. As I was saying a while ago... Want to play? No. Come on, dude. Dickheads. [music] [laughter] Zarina, very good. Very good. OK. Let’s give them five claps. [clapping] You many now take your seats. Thank you very much. Good luck on your next exam. Now on the other hand of the spectrum, [crumpling] Let’s give them half a clap. [clap] Thank you. Okay, now, let’s proceed with our lessons for today. Polar coordinates. Who can define what polar coordinates are? June 15. When I reached my 100th perfect score, I stopped counting. I’ve always known that I’m smart. This isn’t the first time that a teacher has told me that I deserve to be somewhere better. Yo. Can you help me with my geometry? Go see Mr. Pangan. It would be his pleasure to help you. But he’s gay. What? Look, I don’t have anything against gay people, it’s just, I’m not comfortable. Hi! Hi baby! - How's your day? - It was okay. Mom, this is Felix. He’s going to help me with my geometry. Felix, this is my mom. Hi Felix! Let's go. Let’s just go. Who the fuck is this? It's my classmate. He’s going to help me with my geometry. You, be nice. [car engine starting] [music] [faint singing along to headphones] How about you, Felix? Have you ever cheated? Never. Come on. You know Felix doesn’t need to cheat. He’s smart. So you’re saying I’m dumb? You know what I mean. [TV noise] [music] You know, you don’t have to talk to us in English. Me and Maxim know Tagalog and Kapampangan fairly well. It’s okay. I express myself better in English. Yo, Maxim! Keep it down! It’s fine. It’s stupid noise. What did you want to study again? I don’t know. Everything? I’ve been in Geometry for the past like, three years. You’re better at it than I am. What are you smiling at? Nothing. You’re such a weirdo. So, where do you want to start? Are you sure I can borrow this? Yeah, I barely use it anyway. What’s this? Don’t mention it. Come on, Mom’s waiting for us in the car. [car engine starting] [music] June 15. Let me talk to you about what was previously identified as the Clark Air Base. It’s quite amazing what enhancement the Americans have brought to this part of the planet. It’s our little America with picturesque houses and fascinating individuals. Like Magnus Snyder. You’ve never recorded on the radio before? Never. So, are you... going to give this to your girl? What? No. It's for me. You really are a weirdo, Felix. This weirdo is helping you pass geometry if you already forgot. At least you’re earning. Oh, and Max. He wants to talk to you actually. He’s in his room. [knocking] [music] These are all for Monday. But— You want me to tell Magnus that you're in my room looking at my dick? Thought so. Hey, do you see that light post? Yeah? I'll race you to it. If I win, I won’t have to pay you ten dollars for the next time we study. Okay. Okay? Ready? Set. Go! I guess it means it’s free, huh? [laughs] [crickets chirping] [music] Why are you suddenly so studious anyway? Well, Dad promised me and Maxim that he’ll take us back to the States for good after we graduate high school. Not going to happen, bro. Shut up, Maxim. Don’t you want to go to the US? I do. - But not in the way Magnus imagines. - Max! - Hey! - Let’s go. [laughter] [laughter] The little brown monkeys at school will never have equal footing with the Snyder brothers. These pieces of green paper bring me to the same level as Magnus and Maxim. I’ll be home tomorrow morning. Around 6AM? Bye! [kisses] I think we need a break. But how— Don’t worry. You'll still get your ten bucks. You've ever had alcohol before, Felix? No. Ever smoked? No. What a fucking square. Come on Felix, you've got to loosen up a little bit. No, no, no. [music] August 7. I can’t give in to the shortsighted desires of pubescent individuals. Temporary jubilation can only result in long-lasting distress. But maybe, I can partake in the exhilaration of respiring in the second-hand smoke belched from their Filipino-American lungs. That’s enough for now. Come on, Felix, let's dance. I don't dance. We don't dance either, come on. [tapping] Yeah! One more! Last shot. No, no. Maxim, no more. - Yeah. - No, Maxim. No more. - One more! - No, he's had enough. [gagging] I’m sorry. You shouldn’t see me like this. No. It’s cool, man. Hey hey hey hey. How many bottles of gin did you finish? Three. Your mother's cool. Of course she's cool. She's a hooker. Our dad picked her up one night in Fields Avenue, then got drunk together. Then, boom. Fuckfest. First product was Magnus. And after another year of fucking, another product was made. The handsomer one. Dream on. Name was Maximillian. You know, I doubt she even went to that party last night. She probably went to some like horny old white man again. But how do you even know these things? We're not as stupid as you think we are, Felix. [music] August 8. The more I get to be with Magnus and Maxim, the more I find myself drawn to them. The shiny, shimmering Snyder Brothers. The dual dukes of exquisiteness. The genetic miracles of interracial copulation. [sighs] Our dad. He's going to take us back to the States once we graduate high school. [snickers] Oh yeah, don't forget. Reaction paper, three paragraphs, and at least five sentences each. But I haven't seen the movie. The fuck is the Internet for? Just search: "Flor Contemplacion movie summary" on Yahoo, alright? [dial-up internet noises] [typing] [singing] [laughs] [laughs] [spits] [laughs] Why do you want to be with your dad so badly? Your mom's here. He's not. It's not about being with my dad, it's just about being in a better country. I'm just sick and tired of this shitty country. It beats having a whore of a mother. Maybe your mom was a prostitute before but look at her now. She's changed. No she's not. She still screws around with a lot of men. Germans, Arabs, Australians, Russians, you name it. The whole fucking U.N. has been in and out of her pussy, and she thinks we don't know that. But didn't you hear her? Your dad's not going to come and get you. Let's just go back to your house and let's finish our homework. No. I don't see any point in graduating, man. You should just go home. I don't need you. Anyone? Compass! Mr. Salonga. Yes, Ms. Cayanan. Yuan, Ma'am. Correct. After the Mongols defeated the people of the Song dynasty, Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty. [bell rings] We’ll have a long quiz next meeting, okay? Yes, Ma'am. Alright. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Bless us, Oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ, Our Lord. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Goodbye class. Goodbye, Miss Limcauco. Let's eat! I'm not hungry. [zipping] [thud] [dribbling] Magnus! Are you okay? I don't care anymore. [ball bouncing] It's not the end of the world. Why don't we both study hard together so we can go to Manila for college? Then we'll graduate with flying colors. I'll help you. [ball bounces] Shall I help you with our assignment? Not tonight. Two questions, Felix. One, are you gay? What are you — And two, are you in love with my brother? No! Look! Our Filipino teacher is touching Magnus inappropriately. So what? You should see how good Miss Sagcal gives me head. We should tell the Principal immediately. Why? Jealous of Miss Echiverri? This is a horrible place for me and Magnus. Don't you agree? Whatever. Leave me alone. I already knew about Dad's new family in the States. I know you care about my brother. What's your point? Dad will bring us to the States, but only if Mom dies while we're minors. Felix. We should kill Demetria. Magnus doesn't have to know. You're insane! Don't feel bad for Demetria? She's just a used-up whore. I’m aware that Maxim is one mischievous character But it’s only now that I realize: he's malevolent. And it’s this wickedness that actually makes him hotter than Magnus, the good boy. [crickets chirping] [music, birds chirping] [laughs] Anyone out there? Well anyway. Whose turn is it? His turn. Me! Alright. I'll give you one dollar if you tell me who your crush is. [laughs] [shouting] Alright. I'll give you two dollars if you spell "Iris" with your bare butt. [laughs] Okay, game! [laughter] I R I S [laughs] Set it on fire. This is for ten dollars. Only if you do it. Okay. Burn it. You guys want more? Are you guys brave enough to kill a person for a price? Guys. I'm serious. [cat screeching] [sound swelling] September 8. After tasking his friends to kill a person in exchange for currency, rumors are spreading of Maxim’s desire to join the head-severing cult. Am I the only one who knows his true intentions? Or does Magnus know? [laughs] I told you, class. The Internet makes students lazier and less smarter. One click and you already have answers to your homework. Those of you who did not pass their reaction paper, including those who used the Internet in any of their assignments, I want you to fall in line. What? September 21. Two years ago, a student drowned in a beach in Olongapo. His name was Serafin, a.k.a. Pen-pen, a.k.a. Boy Negro because of his kinky hair and dark complexion. The school seems to be more affected by the expulsion of the mestizo siblings than when Pen-pen perished. He was only eleven. The one person who's ecstatic with the departure of Magnus, is Leon Alimurong, the returning alpha male of the batch. Suck it! Everything is going back to its normal, dreary existence. [whimpering] [chatter] You want to hang out? I have a project to finish. But, this can wait. Where'd you want to go? I don't know. Want to see where I used to live? Yeah, let's go. How do we, how do we go back down? Simple. We just walk. Our house should be somewhere around here. How can you tell? I used to count the steps from the main road to our house when we used to live here before. So you count the steps? Yeah. How many steps? Exactly one thousand forty-three. Everything's just gone, huh? Yeah. Even my favorite toy as a kid is buried all under this lahar. What was your favorite toy growing up? An Omegaboy action figure. [laughs] My parents thought we were going to die. Didn't you already know that was going to happen? We were the last ones to evacuate. We stayed here even though everyone else left. How about you? Were you here when Pinatubo erupted? Yeah. Even my dad was still here. I still remember taking this long drive to his friend's house. My mom was quiet the entire time. And you know how loud my mom gets. Anyway, we get to Cavite and my dad tells us he's going to go back to Clark to get a few things. That was the last time I saw him. Were you scared, when it happened? The lahar, kind of. But the eruption, no. I guess you can say I was... amazed. Amazed? By what? The power of nature. The power of nature? Are you serious? Yeah. I mean, didn't you see the smoke in the sky that formed like a giant cauliflower? My parents were crying, and so was everyone else. There was even this priest that led the whole town to pray for their lives. It was funny. And then it wasn't. We were all hungry and tired. And this weirdo was standing outside watching it all happen. Next thing we knew, we came back here and there was nothing. It was like our house didn't even exist at all. The lahar took everything. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For what? I'm over here complaining about my stupid problems, yet... you lost everything, man. Your house got buried underneath all this crap, and... I don't know how you do it but, you still... You're still good at everything that you do. You're pretty cool, Felix. You really think so? Yeah. Come here. [music] Alright, alright. It's getting kinda gay. [music] [splashes] September 22. Losing things has always been a part of my life. But when I look at my friend Magnus, He’s not the Omegaboy action figure that the lahar swept away. He’s not a stick of cigarette I can effortlessly locate in sari-sari stores. At this moment, I have Magnus. And nothing, not even the strongest force of nature, can take that away from me. You know, I've been thinking about what you said. Which one? You know, about studying really hard together, and going to college, graduating with flying colors. Okay. And? I'm in. But how? You were expelled. I’m going to transfer to another school. It's simple. I mean, you could still help me with my homework, right? Even though we're not schoolmates anymore. Of course. You're like a brother to me. You're the best, man. The best. Well. You can leave me here now. How are you going home, anyway? That's the thing. I was, uh... I was wondering if I could sleep over tonight instead. I don't want to go home. Not tonight. Come on, man. Come on. Can I please just sleep over? Sit here first. Sit here first. Careful. Careful. Careful. Do you, uh... Water, water. Water. Water. Hey, sorry. There's still room. You can still fit, come on. Okay. I'll try. I never really had any friends growing up, you know? Nothing. I find that hard to believe. But I know what you mean. No, no you... You're my very first friend in the world. You should get some sleep. Okay. Good night. Good night, man. Magnus. Maxim wants to kill your mother. The fuck, Felix. Wait, Magnus, I'm sorry. You're just going let me leave my mom with him. September 25. There are a hundred things I can conjure in my head as to what Magnus could do to Maxim. At the same time, I’m terrified of what Maxim could do to me for exposing his heinous plan to Magnus. Let's go. It's okay, Felix and I still need to talk. Are you sure? You know your way home later? Yes, mom. Okay. Here's some money for your drinks. Bye! Bye, mom. Where are we going? Let's go. See this, huh? It's all your fault, Felix. What do you need? You owe me. The plan was going well until you came along. Don't you want to do this for Magnus? What are you talking about? You know what. Magnus is already okay staying here. You really think we need you, than you need us? I know Magnus better than you do. Whatever. Come with us next week, to the beach. Why would I do that? If you go, Magnus goes. What's in it for me? You need more money? I'll give you more money. I already have enough. Then what do you want? Take off all your clothes. Really? [music] Forgot your briefs. That's all? Make it hard. You better come, Felix. [fire crackling] Anyway, five claps for Zarina, Jenny, and Felix. [clapping] Thank you, you may now take your seat. You have to mind your studies. You have to be consistent. [thud] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Damn you, son of a bitch! [screaming] September 28. Earlier today, Sheila, one of my classmates, got possessed. [screaming] Thanks to the entity that possessed her, she had temporarily become English-speaking. But I don't care for Sheila. That same day, I managed to have my clean school record tainted for cutting classes under Section No. 81.2 of the Student Handbook. I want to take matters into my own hands. I cannot let Magnus be taken away from me. Especially by his father, who has already abandoned him once. You're already seventeen, we can only do it this time, come on. [knocks] What the hell are you doing here? We're going to the beach. Who invited you? Wait, don't you have school today? You know Maxim will still do it even without you. Let's go. Yeah, we're here! Just watch them really carefully. The entire time. [indistinct chatter] I'm going to go dress up now. Watch them carefully. Carefully. [shouting] [water running] What are you doing here? I told you to watch them. I have something to tell you. Dude, that can wait later, someone has to be there watching them. What are you doing here? Felix. Can I touch you? Felix, what are you doing? I thought we had plans. Just let me touch you. Don't you fucking touch me. Don't ever touch me again. Magnus, wait, I can explain! [crying] [wind, waves] [high pitch noise] Like I said earlier, by the end of the grading period, you will submit your journals. Those who did not submit their journals, kindly fall in line. Mr. Salonga, did you forget your journal at home? No, Ma'am. Where is it? I lost it, Ma'am. That's very unfortunate, Mr. Salonga, I was excited to read your journal. Anyone else? October 6. Only a few days have passed since the untimely death of Magnus. The mourning of the campus ended abruptly when a new dance craze made its way to local television. It's as if the Snyder brothers never existed. [chatter] [silence] Magnus. Magnus. What are you doing here? I have no more dollars for you. [muffled fight sounds] [indistinct muttering] [whimpering] It's so enticing to kill Maxim the way he killed Magnus and their mother. But doing so will not bring Magnus back. Maxim deserves to wallow in his own misery. Maxim vanished after that momentous occurrence. Nobody knows where he went. Some surmise he got abducted by members of the demonic cult and then got decapitated. Or maybe he joined the cult. One day, he shall abduct and behead me. If Maxim manages to behead me, then I wish to dance, drink, and smoke again with Magnus in the afterlife. [music] Felix, I'm here! [music]
