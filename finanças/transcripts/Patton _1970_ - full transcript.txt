Ten-hut! J.” ♪♪ £j' be seated. Now, I want you to remember... That no bastard ever won a war... By dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard... Die for his country. Men... All this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight... Wanting to stay out of the war... Is a lot of horse dung. Americans traditionally love to fight. All real Americans love the sting of battle. When you were kids... You all admired the champion marble-shooter, the fastest runner... The big league ballplayers, the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost... And will never lose a war. Because the very thought of losing... Is hateful to Americans. Now... An army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team. This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap. The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality... For the Saturday evening post... Don't know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating. Now, we have the finest food and equipment... The best spirit... And the best men in the world. You know, by god, I actually pity... You know, by god, I actually pity... Those poor bastards we're going up against. By god, I do. We're not just going to shoot the bastards. We're going to cut out their living guts... And use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy hun bastards by the bushel. Now... Some of you boys... I know are wondering... Whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you will all do your duty. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them. Spill their blood. Shoot them in the belly. When you put your hand into a bunch of goo... That a moment before was your best friend's face... You'll know what to do. Now, there's another thing i want you to remember. I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We're not holding anything. Let the hun do that. We are advancing constantly... And we're not interested in holding onto anything except the enemy! We're going to hold onto him by the nose... And we're going to kick him in the ass. We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time... And we're gonna go through him like crap through a goose! Now... There's one thing that you men will be able to say... When you get back home... And you may thank god for it. Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your fireside... With your grandson on your knee... And he asks you... “What did you do in the great world war ll?” you won't have to say... “Well... I shoveled shit in Louisiana.” all right now, you sons of bitches, you know how I feel. Oh. I will be proud... To lead you wonderful guys into battle... Anytime, anywhere. That's all. The arabs need food and clothing. They strip our dead before we can even bury them. Looks like the reports were pretty accurate. Sixty-one armored vehicles, 45 tons of ammunition, 25 40mm guns... Three self-propelled 105's... Not counting mortars, machine guns, rifles, pistols... Telescopes, belt buckles, g.L. Socks. 1,800 men. Our people salute you, general... For your brilliant amphibious landing on the continent of Africa... And, uh, for your enlightened administration of our country. L've enjoyed being here, excellency. Naturally, I'd prefer to be in Tunisia fighting the Germans. “The lions in their dens tremble at his approach.” I appreciate that, excellency. Magnificent. I wish our troops looked that good. ♪♪ Tell me, general, what do you think of Morocco? I love it, excellency. It's a combination of the Bible and Hollywood. - These men fight at kasserine? - Yes, sir. For the American army to take a licking like that... The first time at bat against the Germans- up against rommel, what we need is the best tank man we've got... Somebody tough enough to pull this outfit together. - Patton? - Possibly. God help us. Lieutenant, where's the duty officer? Sir, he, uh- uh, I think he's at his quarters shaving. Why isn't he here on duty? Guess he needed to shave. We got a new commanding general due today. Who the hell's kicking me in the butt? Oh, sorry, uh, sir. - What were you doin' down there, soldier? - Trying to get some sleep, sir. Well, get back down there, son. You're the only son of a bitch in this headquarters that knows what he's trying to do. Yes, sir. - Brad. How the hell are you? - Fine, George. Good to see you. Hey, we were all under the impression you wouldn't be here until 0900. Yes, I gathered that. - Uh, you know my boys, dick jenson, Alex stiller. - Yes. Brad, tell me, uh, what are you doing here? Well, ike wanted a report on this kasserine business. Meanwhile, I'm to stay here at your headquarters as an observer... But I report directly to ike. A spy- get me general eisenhower's headquarters. Tell me, Brad, uh, what happened at kasserine? - I heard it was a shambles - apparently, everything went wrong. We'd send over a .75mm shell... The krauts would return an .88. Their tanks are diesels. And even when we managed to hit one of them, they kept on running. Our tanks- the men call them “purple heart boxes.” one hot piece of shrapnel, and the gasoline explodes. Mmm, I warned them about the tank. You know, I talked to one of the soldiers about the half-tracks. I asked him if the, uh, machine gun bullets pierced the armor... And he said, “no, sir. The bullets just come through one side and rattle around a bit.” I understand we had a little trouble, uh, coordinating the air cover. - The trouble was no air cover. - General Smith on the line, sir. Excuse me for a minute. Beetle? Listen, I'm calling about, uh, Bradley and his job here. Look, I need a good number two man... And I wanna make Brad my deputy commander, okay? You clear it with ike? Fine, thanks, beetle. Ah. Now you're not spying for eisenhower anymore. You're working for me. - Okay? - Fine. Okay. Dick, you got those stars? - Yes, sir. - Let's get 'em on. What's the matter, Brad? I've been nominated by the president. I know, but, uh... It doesn't become official until it's approved by the senate. Well... They have their schedule, and I have mine. George... If you were named admiral of the turkish Navy... I believe your aides could dip into their haversacks... And come up with the appropriate badge of rank. Anyway, congratulations. Premature congratulations. You know, I think those stars... Would look better on a green shirt. Did I ever tell you about the time i designed a uniform for tank crewmen? It was, uh, green leather, had red stripes... And sort of a-a row of brass buttons down across here... And topped off by a gold football helmet. The army rejected it, of course. Goddamn, it was beautiful. Lloyd fredendall's just leaving. George, there's one other thing i put in my kasserine report. Some of our boys were just plain scared. That's understandable. Even the best fox hound's gun-shy the first time out. I can remember when nothing frightened me as much as the idea... Of a bullet coming straight for my nose. I don't know why, but the image of a bullet coming right for my nose... Was more horrible than any other possibility. Well, I can understand that, George, with such a handsome nose. You wanna know why this outfit got the hell kicked out of it? A blind man could see it in a minute. They don't look like soldiers. They don't act like soldiers. Why should they be expected to fight like soldiers? You're absolutely right. The discipline's pretty poor. Well, in about 15 minutes we're going to start turning these boys into fanatics, razors. They'll lose their fear of the Germans. I only hope to god they never lose their fear of me. Up bright and early, general. Uh, breakfast? Am I to understand that all my officers have finished breakfast? We're open from 6:00 till 8:00. Uh, most of the officers are just comin' in, sir. Please inform these officers that the mess hall is closed. But, sir, it's only a quarter to 8:00. From now on, you will open at 6:00... And no one will be admitted after 6:15. - Where are your leggings? - Leggings? Well- well, hell, general, sir, I'm a cook. You're a soldier. $20 fine. Gentlemen, from this moment, any man without leggings... Without a helmet, without a tie... Any man with unshined shoes or soiled uniform... Is going to be skinned. ♪♪ This is a barracks. Lt's not a bordello. - Good morning, boys. - Good morning, sir. - Ah, doctor. - Sir. I understand you have two cases of, uh, self-inflicted wounds. - Yes, sir, we do. - Uh, get 'em out of here. Sir, one of them's developed a very serious infection. I don't care if he dies. Just get him someplace, but out of here. He doesn't belong in the same building with men that have been wounded in battle. - L'll see that they're moved, sir. - One more thing. There'll be no battle fatigue in my command. That's an order. - Yes, sir. - Battle fatigue is a free ride. A yellow-belly's ticket to the hospital. I'm not going to subsidize cowardice. - Yes, sir. - Uh, doctor? Where's your helmet? I don't wear a helmet when I'm in the hospital, general. Sta rt. I can't use my stethoscope when I'm wearing my helmet. Well... Then cut two holes in your helmet so that you can. And get those yellow-bellies outta here today. Hold it. Turn right here. But, sir, the battlefield is straight ahead. Please don't argue with me, sergeant. I can smell a battlefield. He was out here just yesterday, George. It's over there. Turn right, damn it! It was here. The battlefield was here. The carthaginians defending the city... Were attacked by three Roman legions. The carthaginians were proud and brave, but they couldn't hold. They were massacred. Arab women stripped them... Of their tunics and their swords and lances. The soldiers lay naked in the sun. 2,000 yea rs ago. I was here. You don't believe me, do you, Brad? You know what the poet said: “Through the travail of ages... “Midst the pomp and toils of war... “Have I fought and strove and perished... Countless times upon the star.” uh- “as if through a glass and darkly... “The age-old strife I see... “Where I fought in many guises, many names... But always me.” you know who the poet was? Me. Sir, the interrogation reports on the American prisoners... ...captured in our victory at kasserine. Danke. They are not very good soldiers, these Americans. L'm not so sure... ...after only one battle. Their tanks were no match for our guns. And neither was their leadership, sir. At kasserine they were not under American command. They were under the British general Anderson. British commanders and American troops... The worst of everything! I remind you that Montgomery is a British commander. And he has driven us half way across Africa. Anyway, we have met the Americans for the first time and defeated them. L'm optimistic. You can afford to be an optimist, I can't. There's an opportunity here now for us to mount an offensive. We've concentrated on harassing the enemy's flank... Draw his strength away from the British. However, it appears now that- excuse me- that we could split the Africa corps... And drive through rommel to the sea. L'm sorry, bell, but that territory's been reserved... For general sir Bernard law Montgomery. We're supposed to let him win this one no matter how long it takes him to do it. They're entitled to have their hero. After all... Montgomery did push rommel clear across north Africa. What about the Americans? Don't they need a hero too? You have anybody in mind, George? Excuse me, sir. Air vice marshal coningham is here with general buford. Excuse me, gentlemen... While I ask our British friends what's happened to our air cover. Round one coming up. - Harry. Glad to see you. - Omar. How are you? George, good to see you. Uh, George, you know Arthur coningham. - Sir Arthur. - Delighted to see you, general. L've heard so much about you. Gentlemen, urn, it appears there's been some slight misunderstanding here... And, uh, ike thought that we ought to get the whole thing straightened out. No, no. No misunderstanding. We're supposed to have allied air cover, and we don't get it. German planes are constantly strafing my troops. If I may say so, general, I'm afraid your operations reports are inaccurate. Report? Three days ago... The krauts took off after my command car, ran my ass into a ditch. My staff has assured me we have complete air supremacy everywhere in the mediterranean. When I complained about lack of air cover... You said our troops were not battle-worthy. You spoke of the, uh... Discredited practice of using air force... As an alibi for lack of, uh, success on the ground. It's bad enough I have to wet-nurse Montgomery. I don't have to stand for that. I sincerely apologize for that remark, whoever made it. And I promise you one thing, general. You will see no more German planes. We were discussing, uh, air supremacy, sir Arthur. Damn door won't open! All right now, by god, that's enough! Get that thing outta here! Come on, you bastards! Take a shot at me right in the nose! Get back in here, George. We need a corps commander, not a casualty. How the devil did you manage to stage that? I don't know. But if I could find the Nazi son of a bitches... That are flying those things, I'd give them each a medal. I can't get over how cold it gets in the desert. Awfully cold, sir. Rommel's out there somewhere waiting for me. Yes, sir. You know, if I had my way... I'd send that genius son of a bitch... An engraved invitation in iambic pentameter- a challenge in two stanzas to meet me out there alone in the desert. L'll deliver it. Rommel in his tank, and me in mine. We'd stop about 20 paces, we'd get out, we'd shake hands. Then we'd button up and we'd do battle, just the two of us. And that battle would decide the outcome of the war. It's too bad jousting's gone out of style. It's like your poetry, general. It isn't part of the 20th century. Yeah, you're right, dick. The world grew up. Hell of a shame. Dick, I want a 24-hour guard put around this area. If we don't, the damn arabs will dig 'em up just to get their clothes. Yes, sir. Our graves aren't going to disappear like everybody else's who fought here. The greeks, the romans, the carthaginians. God, how I hate the 20th century. Captain steiger reporting, general. Come with me, steiger. Field marshal rommel... I hope you are feeling better... Captain steiger has been assigned to research general patton. Very well. What do you have for me? General patton comes from a military family. His grandfather was a hero of the American civil war. He was educated at the Virginia military institute and west point. You're not telling me anything about the man. He writes poetry and believes in reincarnation. He's one of the richest officers in the American army. He prays on his knees, but curses like a stable boy. He has one standing order. “always take the offensive, never dig in”. In 15 minutes we meet with the fuhrer. He will want to know how you plan to deal with patton's forces. I will attack and annihilate him! Before he does the same to me. General? General? - What is it? - Sir, we intercepted a German radio message. Rommel's tenth panzer is going to hit us near El guettar. Rommel, huh? All my life... I've wanted to lead a lot of men in a desperate battle. Now I'm going to do it. Look. Battalion strength at least. They haven't spotted our positions yet. They'll get an education in about 10 seconds. Wait'll they get a dose of that artillery fire. Commence firing. Fire at will. Commence firing. Fire at will. Commence firing. Fire at will. What a hell of a waste of fine infantry. - Get general Bradley on the radio. - Yes, sir. Sir, I can't raise him. To hell with that, dick. Tell him to hit 'em hard on their right flank. Here's where we hold 'em by the nose and kick 'em in the ass. Go on! Put him in my car. Rommel... You magnificent bastard, i read your book! Captain Richard n. Jenson was a fine boy- loyal, unselfish and efficient. I am terribly sorry. There are no coffins here, since there is no wood. We will have a trumpeter and an honor guard... But we will not fire the volleys, as it would make people think an air raid was on. I enclosed a lock of dick's hair in a letter to his mother. He was a fine man and a fine officer. And he had no vices. I shall miss him a lot. I can't see the reason such fine young men get killed. There are so many battles yet to fight. ♪♪ Battle-weary but victorious... American g.L.'S and tommies of the British eighth army... Meet in a joyful allied victory celebration at wadi akarit in north Africa. For the first time in this war... Broadway and piccadilly join hands. Meanwhile, general Montgomery, hero of El alamein... Continues to lead his veteran and victorious British eighth army... In a relentless drive against rommel's vaunted Africa corps. It is obvious that north Africa will soon be lost. We must now anticipate the enemy's next move. I shall expect a staff report within 24 hours. That will be all. Steiger, you have said nothing. I wasn't asked anything. L'm asking you now. You think patton will attack sardinia? And why not? Patton, sir... is a military historian. He knows that sicily, not sardinia, has always been the key to Italy. If patton has his way he will attack sicily at Syracuse, as the athenians did. Steiger, this is the twentieth century! But you must understand, sir... Patton is a sixteenth-century man. May I read an example? “On a dark street in New York 1922, wearing white tie and tails... “...patton saw three men pushing a young girl into the back of a truck. “He leaped out of his car, produced a revolver... “...and forced the men at gunpoint to release the girl”. It turned out that the girl was the fiancée of one of the men. They were merely helping her into the truck. What could be more revealing? I don't know what you're talking about. don quixote encounters six merchants of Toledo and saves dulcinea's virtue! Who the devil is dulcinea? Don't you see, sir? Patton is a romantic warrior lost in contemporary times. The secret of patton is the past. He'll urge an attack on sicily because that's what the athenians did! General Bradley's done a tremendous job with second corps. He's moved into bizerte and taken over 41,000 prisoners. - Good. Very good. - You're not surprised, are you, general? After all, you trained that outfit. - Uh, excuse me, general. - Hmm? Sir, this is interesting. We've discovered rommel wasn't present at El guettar. - Who says so? - G-2, sir. Are they telling me that when we took on tenth panzer... Rommel was in Berlin with an earache? Severe nasal diphtheria, sir. G-2 also reports that Hitler probably retained rommel in Berlin... 'Cause things were going badly for the Africa corps. He didn't want his favorite general to lose face. Well, I'm my favorite general... And I don't like to be told that some second-stringer is up against me. Then I lose face. Who the hell are you anyway? General, this is lieutenant colonel codman, your new aide. Oh, yes, codman. I pulled your name off the list because I know your family. Well, I'm glad you did, sir. Codman, rommel is the best the krauts have, and I kicked the hell out of him. Now my own g-2 section is trying to tell me he wasn't even there. But, general, he undoubtedly planned the German battle. If you defeat rommel's plan, you've defeated rommel. Isn't that true, sir? Codman... I want you to have a drink with me tonight. Yes, sir. I have a plan for the invasion of sicily... And I want to make sure i get it approved. You can help me. I wanna give a dinner for general Alexander... Get to him before Montgomery does. This'll be strictly a formal affair, codman, but, uh, purely social. - By that, I mean, urn, purely political. - Yes, sir. I want the finest food, the best wine available. Everything commei/flvut. Oh, thank you. George, this is a really splendid wine. Thank you. Thank you. Sir Harold, I think it was, uh, alcibiades in the peloponnesian war... Uh, 415 b.C. He said, “lf siracusa falls, all sicily falls. And then, Italy.” he knew, you see, that Syracuse was the jugular of the island... And old alcibiades always went for the throat. I propose to take sicily in the same way. - How's it going? - I think the old man has 'em in his pocket. Now, according to my plan... General Montgomery will land here. L'll hit the beaches here, take palermo. Monty will drive north along the coast road. I'll come due east, take messina, and cut off the German escape route. Yes. It looks like an interesting plan, George. Well, gentlemen, uh, to the conquest of, uh, sicily. - Well, to the conquest of sicily. - To sicily. You know, George, you'd have made a great marshal for Napoleon... If you'd lived in the 18th century. Oh, but I did, sir Harold. I did. Morning. Ls general Smith in? - I believe he's in the lavatory, sir. -Thank you. - Ah! There you are, beetle. - Monty. Beetle, I've been giving a good bit of thought to the sicily operation. - Yes? - I, uh- I assume we're alone? You know, Georgie patton's already discussed his plan with Alexander. I realize that, but I have an idea that his plan... May lead to an absolute disaster. Oh? Beetle, look. This is sicily. Now then, according to patton's plan... I would attack Syracuse here... And he would attack palermo up here. Now, obviously, our forces would be divided. And,just as obviously, they could be chopped up piecemeal. Now then, what I propose, and what I shall insist on, by the way... Is this. I will land at Syracuse as planned... But the Americans- the Americans will land here at gela. I will advance north to messina... With the Americans protecting my flank. After all, messina is the key. It's the reason for invading sicily. L'll discuss your plan with ike. L'm sure he'll give it serious consideration. - Amusing, isn't it? - What? That the final plans for the invasion of sicily... Should have been put forward in an Algerian lavatory. George, I've bad news for you about your sicily plan, I'm afraid. Ike has turned it down. He feels that since the Italians will be defending their native soil for the first time... And since the German resistance is stiffening, our forces shouldn't be divided. - Well, uh, where do my people land, then? - In the Gulf of gela. What for? There's nothing there but a beach. Yes, but it puts you in a good position to support Montgomery. And, uh, where does Montgomery land? Well, he'll land in Syracuse and drive north to catania, possibly even messina. And you'll be alongside protecting his left. I see. In other words, we get the burden again... While good old monty gets the glory, huh? Ike had to consider all points of view. He made his decision not as an American, but as an ally. Had it been the other way around, i assure you, monty would protest. You know, I've been in the army 30 years. When I get an order, i say, “yes, sir”... And I do my damnedest to carry it out. But this is what happens... When your commander stops being an American and starts being an ally. Here's the gangster patton, landing at gela with his seventh army. This film was captured after the landing. I didn't realize he was so tall. Over six feet. He's constantly giving personal commands. Obviously they now have two prima Donnas in sicily... Montgomery and patton! There's another three-star general. General Bradley...Commander of the American ll corps. He looks like a common soldier. He is most capable, yet unpretentious. Unusual for a general. Sorry... I don't think I've made myself clear, sir. It's true, Montgomery's met the toughest resistance of the campaign there at catania. - However, if we're requi- - perfectly clear. Old monty is as stuck as a bug on flypaper. Yes, sir, but this order from general Alexander... Directing you to give up the vizzini-caltagirone road and turn it over to Montgomery. And then old Bradley will have to slug- slug, mind you- his way up the center of the island... Over those tough mountain roads, won't he? - Yes, sir. - Messina, bell. Messina! That's the heart of it. If they'd followed my plan, I'd be there by now. I'd cut off the retreat of every goddamn German and Italian on this island! Fine. Now you know what I'm gonna do? First, I'm gonna go to palermo. And I'm still gonna beat that limey son of a bitch to messina if it's the last thing I do! Hey, what's all this talk about taking the vizzini road away from second corps? General Alexander's orders. The road goes to Montgomery. No, that road was assigned to me. How can I get up north without it? Now, you know the terrain up there. L'm sorry, Brad, but monty's run into tough opposition. Very tough. Now, you wouldn't be taking advantage of this situation, would you, George? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Well, without that road... Your whole army, except for my second corps, would be out of a job. Free for you to go into palermo if you felt like it. Who said anything about palermo? I can read a map. Does Alexander know that you pushed out this far? That's a reconnaissance in force. George, are you telling me... That I've got to slug it out over those mountains with heavy resistance... Just so you can make a bigger splash than monty? General, I just follow my orders... Like the simple old soldier I am. General Bradley. Sir, uh, general Alexander's heard we're moving west. He says here: “stop immediately. Go no farther than agrigento. Repeat: Stop immediately.” that's what you think it says. I think it was garbled in transmission. Ask them to retransmit the message, and take your time about it. That'll take half a day at least. Yes, sir. Well, Brad... Where were we? We were talking about a simple, old soldier. Look at that, gentlemen. Compared to war... All other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance. Let's go, sergeant. Move out. Give me that helmet, segovich. Come on. Let's get out of here. What silly son of a bitch is in charge of this operation? I don't know, but they oughta hang him. - Afternoon, padre. - General, these gentlemen are here from the states... Looking over our program for the spiritual welfare of the men. Good. Stick with us, we'll take you right into palermo. Colonel Davis showed us around your quarters, general patton... And I was interested to see a Bible by your bed. You actually find time to read it? I sure do. Every goddamned day. Sir, the Americans have taken palermo! Damn! Sir, patton's taken palermo. Damn! ♪♪ Palermo's the most conquered city in history. First, the phoenicians, the romans, carthaginians... The byzantines. Then came the arabs, spaniards, neapolitans. Now comes the American army. This is from general Alexander, sir... Reminding you that you are not to take palermo. Send him a message, COD. Ask him if he wants me to give it back. Aii right, let me ask you a question fora change. You'vejust come from Washington. How do they feel about our boys taking palermo? Well, sir, the general impression is that your seventh army... Barreled through token resistance... While Montgomery faced the brunt of the fighting. My god, don't they know we took on the Herman gehring division? Toughest outfit in the German army. Well, the people at home are interested in you, general. - They're curious about your Pearl-handled revolvers. - They're ivory. Only a pimp from a cheap New Orleans whorehouse would carry a Pearl-handled pistol. - What about your language, general? - Well, when I want it to stick... I give it to them loud and dirty. - Then they'll remember it. - What do your troops feel about that, general? Damn it, I don't want these men to love me. I want 'em to fight for me. Ernie pyle says you have a secret weapon here in sicily- general Bradley. The “g.L. General.” that's what Ernie calls him. Omar Bradley's no secret. He's a damn fine commander. What's your feeling about Montgomery? He's the best general the English have... But he seems a little more concerned... With not losing a battle than he does about winning one. He's not aggressive enough. Ls that correct? Look, boys, I've been gettin' into a lot of trouble lately. Yesterday, the inspector general's office told me... My Italian prisoners didn't have enough latrines. Hell, they didn't know what a damn latrine was till I showed 'em. If I've said anything a little too critical of my distinguished British colleague... Let'sjust, uh, forget all about it, huh? I will tell you one thing, though, off the record. L'm gonna beat that gentleman to messina. Ah, Freddy. Do you realize what this madman patton is saying? He's going to save our skins by taking messina! Well, this report might interest you, sir. Here I am in these bloody marshes, fighting malaria as well as the Germans... While he's taking palermo without opposition and getting all the glory. Ah! Well. Now he's up against three good Jerry divisions, and he's stuck for a change. He's not going to get messina. That is reserved for the British eighth army and me. It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry Allen's first division is bogged down east oftorina. You're bogged down on the coast road. What we need is another end run just to break things loose. Ah, Lucian. How's my fighter? - Fine, George. - Uh, come in. Come in. We need another one of your, uh, amphibious specialties. Lucian, I want you to send a reinforced battalion by sea... To make a landing up here at brolo behind the kraut lines. General Bradley says you want me to tie this in with a land-based attack. That's right. I want a coordinated attack the morning of the 11th. I don't think we can make the linkup by the 11th. - Hell, it's only 15-20 miles. - General, my boys have been fighting and dying for yards. Mm-hmm. Maybe you better kick a few butts if you have to. Lucian, I recommended you for your d.S.M. And your last promotion. I know what you can do when you put your mind to it. Excuse me, sir. L'm sorry, but I can't do the impossible. Well, you're too old an athlete... To think that you can postpone a match that's already been scheduled. You're an old athlete yourself, sir. You know matches sometimes are postponed. George. George, if Lucian's right and we can't back him up by land... Our end run could be a disaster. Now, those men might get caught up there on the beach and cut to pieces. - What's the matter with you two? - All we 're talking about... Is not rushing in until we're ready. - Give him an extra day. -Just one more day. The landing is on. We're going to messina. We're gonna get there before Montgomery does. What's so important about that? General truscott... If your conscience will not permit you to conduct this operation... L'll relieve you and find somebody who can. General, it's your privilege to relieve me... Anytime you want to. Well, this match will not be postponed. You have any questions? No, sir. You're a very good man, Lucian... But you wanna guard against being too conservative. Remember what Frederick the great said: “L 'audace! L'audace! Toujours i'audace!” go on, have a drink. Excuse me, sir. I won't be drinking for the next couple of clays. If anything happens to those men, I'd like to be there with them. Well, you're not going, so forget about it. You believe truscott's right, hmm? No. But I do know that you're gambling with the lives of those boys... Just so you can beat Montgomery into messina. And if you pull it off, you're a big hero. But if you don't... What happens to them, the ordinary combat soldier? He doesn't share in your dreams of glory. He's stuck here. He's stuck living out every day, day to day, with death tugging at his elbow. There's one big difference between you and me, George. I do this job because I've been trained to do it. You do it because... You love it. Those men on the beach are really catching hell, general. Truscott's men are doing their best. We have no replacements for him. He can't break through to the coast. L'm going down there myself. Colonel! How in the hell did he get over there? What the hell are you waiting for? Looking for a place to Ford, general. I sent out a patrol to reconnoiter. L've already done that! Right down there! This sewer's no more than three feet deep. Now, you get that outfit cranked up, or you're gonna be out of a job! - Ana' put that helmet on! - Yes, sir! Move it! Let's go! - What's holding up this column? - I don't know, sir. Planes! Come on! Move it! Pull up over there. What's going on here? - Sir, it's these mules! -Jackasses! You let a whole column get stalled and strafed on account of a couple ofjackasses? What the hell's the matter with you? No. No. Now dump 'em over the side and clear this bridge! The reason we're pinned down, general, is we can't get any air support! The hell with that! Nobody's getting any air support. If you can't put some fire into this battalion, colonel, I'll get somebody who can! - Major! You the executive officer here? - Yes, sir. - What's your name? - Walker, sir. Well, you're now the commanding officer. You got four hours to break through that beachhead down there. Ifyou don't make it by then, l'll fire you! Colonel, there are 50,000 men on this island who'd like to shoot that son of a bitch. Take me home. Please take me home. Take me home. Please take me home. Take me home. Please take me home. Take me home. Please take me home. There he goes, old blood and guts. Yeah, our blood, his guts. Hi. How are you, son? Where you from, uh, Gomez? California, sir. Me too. Where were you hit? In the chest, sir. Well, this might be interesting to you... But the last German I saw didn't have any chest. Didn't have any head either. You get well quickly, son. What's the matter with you? \_ I guess I just can't take it, sir. What did you say? It's my nerves, sir. I- l-i just can't stand the shelling anymore. Your nerves? Why, hell, you'rejust a goddamned coward. Shut up! I won't have a yellow bastard sitting here crying... In front of these brave men who've been wounded in battle. Shut up! Don't admit this yellow bastard. There's nothing wrong with him. I won't have sons of bitches who are afraid to fight... Stinking up this place of honor! You're going back to the front, my friend. You may get shot, and you may get killed... But you're going up to the fighting. Either that, or I'm going to stand you up in front of a firing squad. I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamn whimpering bastard. Get him out of here! Send him up to the front! You hear me? You goddamn coward! I won't have cowards in my army. I had to kick a few butts up there, but, uh... Truscott finally broke through to those people on the beach. Have you seen the casualty lists? Yes, I've seen 'em. What's the word from the coast road? Well, the third division is east of brolo heading toward messina. Good. Let's get dressed and get over there. I wanna go in with the troops. You go ahead, George. I'm not very good at that. General Bradley, it's time to consider... Just how many casualties we'd have... If we were still down there crawling along that goddamn road. ♪♪ Forward march! Don't smirk, patton. I shan't kiss you.

I, uh, was rereading Caesar's commentaries last night. In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to distinguish him from his men. I was struck by that fact because- “despicable.” that's the first time in my life... Anybody ever applied that word to me. Well, uh, at least it's a personal reprimand. Lt's not official. The man was yellow. He should have been tried for cowardice and shot. My god, have they forgotten about all the people who have taken a hell of a lot worse... Than a little kick in the pants? I ruffled his pride a little bit. What's that compared to war? Two weeks ago, when we took palermo, they called me a hero. Said I was the greatest general since stonewall Jackson. And now, they draw cartoons about you. Hmm. Dirty bastard. They got me holding a little g.L. There and kicking him with an iron boot. You see that? What's on my boot? A swastika! On my boot! An iron boot with a swastika on it! “You will apologize to the soldier you slapped... “To all doctors and nurses who were present in the tent at the time... “To every patient in the tent who can be reached... “And, last but not least, to the seventh army as a whole...

But the pro letters are mostly from relatives and servicemen. “L want you to know that we are proud our son is serving in your army. “From the newspaper accounts, we are not clear exactly what you did and why... “But we want you to know we are for you. Keep going, and god bless you.” keep going, huh? Where? I thought you might like a sip of wine, general. Lt's new year's. You didn't celebrate at all last night.

They've relieved me from command of the seventh army. I don't believe it. Happy new year. Just a minute, sir. Since they're sure to give you another command... Isn't it logical that they'd relieve you here first? You mean command of all the American troops going into Europe? It's a possibility. I- I know it's been discussed from time to time. Well, the logic of it is so obvious, it couldn't mean anything else. Sir, I'm going to open this bottle of wine. No, sir COD. But if you find a bottle of cognac and open it, l'll help you drink it. How you feeling tonight, general? Not bad. Not bad at all. - Get me some writing paper, will you, George? - Yes, sir. Your wife ever give you the devil for not writing? All the time, sir. Only I don't write as often as you do. Don't seem to get around to it. Lucky thing for us we've got 'em, huh? Who wants to marry a couple of broken-down old horse cavalrymen? That's what my wife says to me every time I come home, sir. What are you doing up so late, George? Just thought you might like a nice hot bath or a glass of milk or something.

Those men are sitting on the beach at calais throwing pebbles at each other... ...while our men are being slaughtered in normandy. The fifteenth army is waiting for patton at calais and he will land there. You seem perfectly willing to accept this nonsense,jodl. Why? Because I am not prepared to dispute the fuhrer.

Shaef is up against a new set of priorities. - I think I smell Montgomery. - Oh, now, take it easy, George. There are serious issues involved here, political issues. By god, it is Montgomery. The launching sites for the v-2 bombs are all in his area. Mr. Churchill wants those rocket bases destroyed. Hitler's killing more civilians in London than he is soldiers in the field. They expect Montgomery to do anything about it? You give me that gasoline, and I'll gain ground with it. I'll kill Germans too. - Give me 400,000 gallons, I'll go to Berlin. - George, I can't do it.

They kept buzzing around in my head. I couldn't figure it out. Then I remembered. That nightmare in the snow. The endless, agonizing retreat from Moscow. How cold it was. They took the wounded and what was left of the supplies and threw 'em in the carts. Napoleon was finished. Not any color left. Not even the red of blood. Only the snow. Look at this, COD. I love it.

Now listen, I want you to transfer... 10th armored to middleton's eighth corps right away. Now, Brad, you can't do that. George, now, listen. I don't have time to argue. There's a lot of enemy activity up around ardennes. No. No, I don't know how serious it is, but... Ike wants us to meet with beetle Smith tomorrow at verdun. Be there at 1100. Yes, sir. There's absolutely no reason for us to assume... That the Germans are mounting a major offense. The weather is awful. Their supplies are low. The German army hasn't mounted a winter attack since Frederick the great. Therefore, I believe that's exactly what they're going to do. All right. Now, I want you to start making contingency plans... For pulling out of our eastward attack, changing directions 90 degrees... Moving up to Luxembourg. Don't look so stunned, gentlemen. I want you to plan for three possible axes of attack. From diekirch due north. From arlon to, uh, bastogne. From neufchateau against the German left flank. We've identified four German armies. The seventh, fifth panzer... Sixth ss panzer and the fifteenth. They've hit us with 26 divisions. They overran two regiments of the 106th division... And 7,500 of our men were forced to surrender. But our immediate concern is that Von rundstedt has the 101 st airborne... Trapped here at bastogne. Bastogne, by the way, is the key to this entire area. Ifwe can hold it, we can break up the entire German offensive. If they take it, we're in serious trouble. Ike wants to know if anybody can get up there and relieve the 101 St... Before they're torn to pieces. L'm afraid there's nothing that field marshal Montgomery can do. At any rate, not for some weeks. What about you, George? I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours. Well, I'd give myself some leeway if I were you. Ike wants a realistic estimate, George. You're in the middle of a fight now, and it's- it's over 100 miles to bastogne. My staffs already working out the details. Well, frankly, i don't see how it's possible. Not in this kind of weather. I should've thought you'd want to fall back and regroup. Not me, Freddy. I don't like to pay for the same real estate twice. But what about your men? You can't pull them out of the line and cart them off 100 miles... And then expect them to attack without rest. I trained these men, Arthur. They'll do what I tell 'em to do. Yeah. Perhaps we hadn't realized... That you were quite so popular with your troops, general. L'm not. They'll do it because they're good soldiers... And because they realize as I do that we could still lose this war. Hmm. Then I think I can speak for field marshal Montgomery. He'd say you're asking the impossible of your men. Of course he would, 'cause he's never realized... That that's what we're in business for. Sir, general mccauliffe turned down a German surrender demand. - Know what he said? - What? He said, “nuts.” keep 'em moving, colonel. A man that eloquent has to be saved. This is where it pays off... The training and the discipline. No other outfit in the world... Would pull out of a winter battle, move 100 miles... Go into a major attack with no rest, no sleep, no hot food. God. God, I'm proud of these men. Sir, Von ru ndstedt's thrown another panzer division against bastogne. 101 st airborne's holding on by its fingernails. Damned air cover's what we need. If we had 24 hours of decent weather, we might make it. General Mason, sir. Hello, mace? Listen, we're short on foot soldiers. I want you to cannibalize your antiaircraft units and turn 'em all into riflemen. Yes, every damn last one of 'em you can find. Evening, general. I just got the weather report for tomorrow. - More snow. - There goes our air cover. Sir, we may have to pull up and wait for better weather. There are brave men dying up there. L'm not going to wait. Not an hour. Not a minute. Going to keep moving. Ls that clear? We're going to attack all night. We're going to attack tomorrow morning. If we are not victorious... Let no one come back alive. You know something, general? Sometimes, they can't tell when you're acting and when you're not. It isn't important for them to know. It's only important for me to know. - You wanted to see me, general? - Oh, yes, chaplain. L'm sick and tired of third army having to fight the Germans... The supreme command, no gasoline, and now this ungodly weather. - I want a prayer. A weather prayer. - A weather prayer, sir? Yes, let's see if you can't get god working with us on this thing. Gonna take a pretty thick rug for that kind of praying. I don't care if it takes a flying carpet. Well, I don't know how this is gonna be received, general. Praying for good weather so we can kill our fellow man? Well, I can assure you, sir, because of my intimate relations with the almighty... If you write a good prayer, we'll have good weather. And I expect that prayer within an hour. Yes, sir. “Almighty and most merciful father... “We humbly beseech thee... “Of thy great goodness... “To restrain this immoderate weather... “With which we've had to contend. “grant us fair weather for battle. “Graciously harken to us... “As soldiers who call upon thee... “That armed with thy power... “We may advance from victory to victory... “And crush the oppression... “And wickedness of our enemies... “And establish thy justice... “Among men and nations. Amen.” weather's perfect. COD, get me that chaplain. He stands in good with the lord, and I want him decorated. Hiya, general! ♪♪ Supported by medium bombers and fighter bombers... Which fly countless sorties against German positions... Elements of the third army, spearheaded by the fourth armored division... Drive into the besieged city of bastogne... To relieve its 18,000 defenders on the day after Christmas. During this operation, third army moved farther and faster... And engaged more divisions in less time... Than any other army in the history of the United States. This is the end... ...the end. Hurry, steiger. I want everything destroyed. Papers, maps, everything! Everything will be destroyed, general, that I can promise you. L'll never let the Russians take me! L'll kill myself, like the flihrer! He, too, will be destroyed. The absence ofwar will kill him. The pure warrior... ...a magnificent anachronism... ' ♪♪ ' Jj/ends] Excuse me, sir. General katl Whether you will join him to drink to the surrender of Germany. My compliments to the general. Please inform him that I do not care to drink with him... Or any other Russian son of a bitch. Sir, i- I cannot tell the general that. You tell him that. Tell him word for word. The general says he thinks that... You are a son of a bitch too. Okay, l'll drink to that. One son of a bitch to another. ♪♪ General, is it true that president Roosevelt, before he died... Promised you a combat command in the pacific? Yes, he did. But now that he's gone... I don't think there's much chance of that. Doug MacArthur doesn't want me out there. We've been told about these wonder weapons the Germans were working on. Long-range rockets, push-button bombing... Weapons that don't need soldiers. Wonder weapons? My god, I don't see the wonder in 'em. Killing without heroics. Nothing is glorified. Nothing is reaffirmed. No heroes, no cowards, no troops. No generals. Only those who are left alive... And those who are left dead. L'm glad I won't live to see it. It's been pointed out, general, that you're still using former Nazis in key positions... Despite the official de-nazification policy. Well, if I'm supplied with trained personnel, l'll get rid of the Nazis. Until then, I'll use the people who can run the railroads and keep the telephones working. After all, general, didn't most ordinary Nazis join the party... In about the same way Americans become Republicans or democrats? Yes, that's about it. You do agree, don't you, general, that our national policy... Should be made by civilians and not by the military? Of course I agree. But the politicians never let us finish. They always stop short and leave us with another war to fight. You thinking about our Russian allies? Sir, did you say if you found your army between the Germans and the Russians... You'd attack in both directions? No, I never said that. I never said any such thing. But I wish I had. Sir, there's a call on your line from supreme headquarters. General Smith. - Beetle? - Ike is furious. How could you possibly compare the Republicans and democrats to the Nazi party? And this statement that you refuse to de-nazify has everybody screaming. The Russians, the British, everybody. Well, the hell with the mongoloid Russians. We've given 'em Berlin, we've given 'em Prague, and god knows what else. Are we gonna let 'em dictate policy too? George, don't be a fool. The war in Europe is over. Washington dictates policy. Well, the war shouldn't be over and we should stop pussyfooting about the goddamn Russians! We're gonna have to fight 'em sooner or later anyway! Why not do it now while we got the army here to do it with? Instead of disarming these German troops, we oughta get 'em to help us fight the bolsheviks! George, you better shut up. This line may be tapped! Well, I don't give a damn if it is. I'll tell you something, beetle. Up until now, we've been fighting the wrong people. Look, you and ike don't have to get involved if you're so damn soft about it. You leave it to me. In 10 days, I'll have us at war with those sons of bitches... And I'll make it look like their fault! George, you're mad. You're absolutely out of your mind! Well, I'm no diplomat! I'm a combat soldier. That's all these jokers understand. You get ike to give me the word, and I'll kick their behinds back into Russia where they belong! Shall I call the artist back, sir? No, the hell with it. Nobody wants to see a picture of me. I'm mad. Don't you know that? Field marshal Montgomery, his majesty is prepared... To receive the next chief of the imperial general staff. Good-bye, colonel. Good-bye. Good-bye, and thank you. Thank you. Take care of yourself, COD. George. Well, uh, gentlemen. All good things must come to an end. And the best thing that's happened to me in my life... Has been, uh- uh, the honor... And, uh, privilege... Of commanding the third army. Good-bye, and god bless you. Brad, they've, uh, taken third army away from me. I know. I just thought we could have dinner together tonight. Thank you, Brad. That's damn thoughtful. I appreciate it. Right now, I think I'm going to take Willy for a walk. George, look out! After all I've been through... Imagine getting killed by an oxcart. You know, Brad, there's only one proper way for a professional soldier to die. That's from the last bullet of the last battle of the last war. At least, the third army earned its pay. In our drive across Europe, we liberated... 12,000 cities and towns... Inflicted a million and a half enemy casualties. I have a feeling that from now on, just being a good soldier won't mean a thing. L'm afraid we're gonna have to be diplomats, administrators. - You name it. - God help us. George, I want to say one thing. You've clone a magnificent job here in Europe. That's right, George. I think that soldier you slapped back there in sicily... Did more to win the war than any other private in the army. L'll see you for dinner. 6130? For over a thousand years... Roman conquerors returning from the wars... Enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeters and musicians... And strange animals from the conquered territories... Together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot... The dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children, robed in white... Stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror... Holding a golden crown... And whispering in his eara warning... That all glory is fleeting.
