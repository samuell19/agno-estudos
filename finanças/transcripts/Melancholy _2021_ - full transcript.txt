Every girl carries with her this same vague fear. "Will I live to be happy?" THE CINDERELLA ADDICTION Yeah? Hi, we're from the Children's Welfare Center. It's about Asuka. What about my daughter? She's fine. I'm busy now. No, wait! Can we just see her to make sure she's okay? That hurts! Ow, you're hurting me. Let go... I said, let go! Ow... I guess we'll be getting another complaint. That woman is a bad mother. Though, Asuka was smiling. Her eyes were lifeless. "The future destiny of a child is always the work of the mother." - What's that? - Words of some great person. I can't remember who, though. I bet it's Mother Teresa. Or maybe Nightingale. The couple threatened the principal with a knife and demanded that the school redo the annual sports day. The couple, from Matsuo City, Saitama was arrested. They went to their child's school last month... THREATENS WITH KNIFE TO REDO SPORTS DAY They went to their child's school last month... They went to their child's school last month... Idiot parents. What were they thinking? I'll never become parents like them. I often said that to myself since I began working in welfare. But the first time I thought it was much much earlier. It was when I was still ten years old. Mom, Mom! Mom, don't go! I quit being your mother! Mom, Mom! Mom! I'll never become a parent like her. FUKUURA BICYCLE SHOP I'm home. Threatening the principal with a knife just over sports day. It's crazy. Unbelievable. I know right? I really hate parents without morals. No, I mean, curry again? I'm busy with work these days. But you like curry. Four days in a row now. We're not Indians, jeez. I know. Which is why I also made some Japanese miso soup. Ow! It's hot. You're not eating any, Grandpa? Nah, my head. I'll take a bath and go to sleep. Must hurry and get this smell off me. Hurry and curry rhymes. Fine, don't eat any then. Elbows. MEICHI UNIVERSITY Must it be a private university in Tokyo? Here, the tuition. Hmm? We can't afford that. Then you want to tell Chinatsu to give up? She's working so hard. Oh shoot. What a waste. Eww, gross. Give me a break. I'm your father. Here. Dad! What's wrong? Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Dad, are you okay? Red underwear, seriously? Who cares now, be careful! - Ouch! - Hey, Dad! Watch it, go straight! Grandpa. We're almost at the hospital. Dad... Watch where you're driving! Damn that drunk doofus. Oh, shoot. I've been drinking too. I'm the one that said we'd be faster than an ambulance. So it's my fault, okay? Don't cry, Dad. Don't worry, everything will be okay. I'm hanging up now. Chinatsu, do you think he'll be okay? A fire at Fukuura Bicycle Shop in Asaba Town. I repeat, fire at Fukuura Bicycle Shop. Please head to the site. Did he just say Fukuura? Stand back! It's dangerous, so please stand back! Whoa, stand back. Watch it. It's dangerous, stand back. Everybody, take a step back! The train isn't running yet. It's fine, my boyfriend lives nearby. I bet she's going to get it on even at a time like this. Lucky them. Bite my finger. Hiromu! Huh, why...? I mean... Why you? I'm too tired for this. Wait, Koharu! Koharu, wait, no! Ouch... Are you okay? Sorry. I bet we look pretty suspicious. I'm sorry. I don't usually drink, but we were having a class reunion. Does your ear hurt? I just have this ringing in my ear. Take him home, please. Take care. Yeah, thanks. Sorry, really. Hold on, be right back. Um, excuse me! Just one sec. Let me pay for your clothes and your shoes. No, don't worry about it. Then at least let me make it up to you some time. She said you grabbed her so hard she got bruised. What were you thinking? This is serious, you know? You tell her, Shiraishi. Everybody makes mistakes. We're all human. You're lucky she's nice. FUKUURA BICYCLE SHOP Dinner's ready, Dad. Come eat while it's warm. I'll never find another job at this age. Besides, bicycles are all I know. You've got the cleaner's tag still on. Did you know one milliliter of insulin can kill a guy from hypoglycemia? Just one milliliter. What? You want to die? I would never leave my daughters like that. I'm quitting cram school. I'll find a job after I graduate. I don't really have to go to university anyway. No, you should. Your grades are finally improving. But our shop's burnt down, and Grandpa's hospital expenses, too. Uh... I'll manage it. It's fine. I'll just give up university. I mean, you're in trouble at work, right? Worry about yourself first. You don't have to act like a mom. Cute little baby. What's more important, your job or your family! Your husband? He says he has to entertain another important client tonight. What a nice daddy you have, working so hard. Koharu's finally breaking up with Hiromu. Really? You've dated him for ten years since you were 16. So you really saw them doing it? Hey, not in front of the baby. She was grinding on top of him. A colleague from work. Whoa, that's harsh. But hey, his musical career was going nowhere. Time to move on. You say it like it's nothing. I mean it. I'm really worried for you. I'll let you in on a secret that'll make life easier. A secret? Throw away your dreams and aspirations. To marry well, to live well, to be a good mother. Throw all those dreams away. I don't get it. I'm telling you. Dreams are what end up torturing us. We get stressed when things don't go as we hope. Aren't you grateful for my little secret? But that sounds so boring. I shouldn't have told you. But after all that's happened to you, I'm sure God will give you a break. Your turn will come. Like? Like a new guy? A new guy, huh? Yeah, I did meet one. Really? Is he hot? A prince riding a white horse? Director, Izumisawa Clinic. Daigo Izumisawa. A doctor? And he has his own hospital? He must be filthy rich. Stop it. Where did you hook up? We haven't hooked up. - Did you call him? - No. Call him. Now! A doctor in a fine car beats a prince on a white horse. Come on, hurry. No way, I'm not calling him. Why? It'll look nice on you. But the price... We'll take this. Thank you. Hey, how about these shoes? Try them on. I couldn't... Take those off. Here. How's that? Perfect. It's thanks to you that I'm alive. I just did what anybody else would. If it were anybody else, I might've been dead. Nobody wants to see a guy run over by a train, yet everyone's a bit curious. Humans are like that, right? You think so? Are you sick? You're pale. Are you getting enough sleep? Not recently, no. Did you tell your boyfriend about meeting me? - No... - Did you get in a fight? Did I tell you I had a boyfriend? You had a ring on when we first met. But not today. Actually, he cheated on me that day. It's over now. Sorry. It's all in the past now. "Why don't we go together now to beat him up?" "Yah, yah, yah." Sorry. You're married, aren't you? Did you tell your wife about meeting me? Oh, you're a naughty boy. My wife passed away. In an accident. It's all in the past now. So, do you like horses? Horses? Horses. Ever been to Kuroshio, the horse meat place? No. I have plans to go tonight. Do you want to join us? You and who? Come on. Hey. Okay. Nice to meet you. I'm Koharu. What's your name? Say your name. Come on, Hikari. Oops, I said it. I know, I get nervous too. What happened? An eye contusion. Wow, you know long words. She's fine now, but she likes it. Why don't you take it off? Come on, take it off already. Excuse me. Two oolong teas. One orange juice. Found it Let me do your makeup. Turn this way. That's good for now. Okay. There, done. See? Look Papa, look! Wow, that's cute. She drew it for me. It's so shiny. We were playing dodge ball, and it came bang! Right at my eye. Wow, that must've hurt. Your eye might rot. No it won't. The doctor said it was fine. This is so good, let's horse around! Neigh! Clap, clap. No, it's "Clop, clop." Oh yeah. Clop, clop! I can't believe it. Hikari can be kind of difficult with people. Not at all. She's a great girl. You're good with children. I always looked after my little sister. We didn't have a mother, either. She passed away? Nope. She just upped and disappeared when I was ten. Why? Who knows? Did your parents not get along? I thought we were a pretty close family. I guess she found some other happiness that meant even more to her. Anyways. Parents who abandon their kids are the worst. Then you'll have to become happy to get back at her. I wonder if happiness will ever come to me. It seems so far away now. Koharu. You can ask me for anything. I want to help you. Thank you so much. Not at all. I can't. I don't want to touch dead people. Don't be so picky. Is it so picky not to want to touch dead people? Daigo found this job for you. Just call me Dai. Why don't you just hear the job description? So that's basically how the job is done. Usually, we just wait at the office for somebody to pass away. Any questions? About this here. The pay is this good? It's a commission system, so it could amount to more. If it's okay with you, we're ready to hire. 126 over 80. Sure, we're away from the city center, but it's a nicer place than the community hospital. But the expenses? No, don't worry about it. You saved the life of my former student. I'm glad Daigo found a nice girl this time. I'm relieved. You haven't heard about his late wife? About Mayuka. Just that she died in an accident. Oh, uh... What an awful woman she was. We're back. There you are. - Look, Dr. Kyoda. - What? Poop! Who drew that? Now, you substitute this into that equation. I see. I get it now. That's easy. Sure is. Promise not to tell? I promise. What? Pinky swear if you break this promise, you'll drink 1,000... gazillion needles! It's a deal! Wataru? Keep it down! How about you? Do I like somebody? Papa does. I can't tell you who though. Who? I can't tell, I can't tell. What, you can't tell me? Can you teach me science too? Sure. I can tutor you starting next week. Let us pay you then. No, I just want her to get into a university. Dai made me realize how awful my teachers are at teaching. Oh yes, I went to visit Dad. What a fancy hospital. Isn't that room expensive? Yeah, it usually is. We can't take him back to the community hospital now. Thank you for everything, Dai. We're so indebted to you. Anything I can do for you. Then won't you marry Koharu? Stop that, Dad. I want Koharu as my mama! See, how about that? I'm sorry! Forgive me. Hiromu. You don't think I could love anybody other than you. But I can, you know. Impossible. No! You don't have a say in it. No, please no. No! No. Please forgive me. I'll shave my head. Then why haven't you already? Lies, lies, and more lies. You'll cut your hair for me? Cut your dick off instead. You're the only one for me. I mean it. I'm serious. I can't put it into words. So here goes. I'm sor... What on earth did I see in him for ten whole years? Don't worry. Cheaters will go to hell. Isn't this one cute? Too childish. Hikari is a child. You don't understand girls. Girls? She's a second grade girl. Her heart is already that of a grown up. I haven't sewn anything for years. I hope I can do this. Ah, don't tell Hikari. I want it to be a surprise. Thanks. This is about all I can do. Hey! This is all so sudden... I know. It's not that I don't like you. It's just... You want more time, sure. And I wish I could give it to you. Then let's take it slower and... I don't have time. You're still 26. But I'm almost 41. Besides... I feel like Hikari needs a mother. A mother... Happy birthday dear Hikari... Happy birthday to you! Congratulations! Let's eat. But before that... Here, for you. - Can I open it? - Sure. What can it be? What is it? Wow, it's so cute! Is this a pencil case? Yeah, and Koharu made it for you. Really? Wow! Thank you. She loves it. I'm glad. So... Are you sure that it's me you want? Hikari! She's going to be your mama! Really? Really? You'll be my mama? Really? Let's go. Where? The City Hall. We can get registered today. What better birthday present than a brand new mom for Hikari? You're getting married? Congratulations. Can you believe it? We're a family now! Mama! Yay! Yippee! Come on. This way! It might hurt a little. Okay, open your fist. You're so weird, wanting to do an IV drip. It's just water, salt, and sugar. I'd never had one in all my 26 years. A dream of mine. From now on, I'll be the one to make all your dreams come true. I can hear it. Come here. I can't hear. Of course you can. - Seriously. - Yeah right. I can't hear. Thump, thump. Let me. Your heart is racing. I think it might explode. It was before she turned two. Hikari doesn't remember Mayuka much. No memories of having a mother. What happened between you and her? What do you mean? Dr. Kyoda said. That she was an awful woman. She was in the car with another guy when she crashed. A university student. They'd met online. The funeral was really awkward. Couldn't cry at all. I'd do anything for Hikari. I'd even take on the whole world. I'd gladly give her my life. I think that's what a real parent does. But Mayuka wasn't prepared to become a real parent. My mom was the worst, too. When she tried to leave, I clung onto her for dear life. I begged her not to go. But she shook me off. And said she quit being my mother. Can you believe it? Abandoning being a mother like that. I hate irresponsible people. I'm thinking of punching her if I ever meet her again. I really mean it. I played it out in my head all the time. But it's fine now. I'm not like her. I'll be Hikari's real mother. You don't know a mother's love. And you think you can become one? Mom! I'm just asking. It's important. Becoming a mother and being a mother is a completely different thing. Sorry about earlier. Parenting is difficult. No matter how hard you try, nobody praises you. Just wanted you to know that. Take good care of my son for me. Koharu is so pretty. She sure is. Here we go. Ready? Congrats! Thank you! Koharu, a word please! And go. I'll make Dai and Hikari very happy! Clap, clap! Nice one, Koharu. There. Hikari, wake up. Please don't tell Papa. I won't. Here. Bye! Have a nice day. Take care. Form your lunch groups. What? My dad's an astronaut. He walked on the moon. No way, you're lying. I have this disease that I die if I lie. So I can't lie. See? You're lying again. If I really were lying... What's wrong? Hikari, what is it? Hikari, are you okay? What's wrong? She's beautiful. You're like a real-life Cinderella. Every girl would envy you. But you've only known him for a month. Isn't that scary? Do you even know him well enough? It's not like time reveals everything either. But the Cinderella story gives me the creeps. She only danced with him at one ball. And they're suddenly united over a dropped shoe. How could you marry someone when all you know is their shoe size? You never dream, do you? Do you even plan on marrying? Then find me someone. Why me? Why not? Koharu. Stop licking the whipped cream off of mint leaves. You're a doctor's wife now, remember? Stop it. IZUMISAWA CLINIC The medicine has its risks, so try not to take too many. The medicine has its risks, so try not to take too many. But Doctor, if I don't, it'll take me longer to get well. Then grind some dried deer penises and take some after each meal. It'll work immediately. Deer penises? Yes. Take care. NEW INFLUENZA THREAT VACCINES AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN NEW INFLUENZA THREAT VACCINES AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN Mama, Mama. NEW INFLUENZA THREAT VACCINES AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN NEW INFLUENZA THREAT VACCINES AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN Mama. Mama. Wait! Don't give that to her. Mama! Wait, Hikari. Yeah, there's shrimp extract in this. I'm glad I stopped you. - Mama! - Allergies? Not exactly, but she threw up a lot when she had some last. Then we shouldn't. Mama. Okay, let's eat something else. How about some meatballs? Sorry about that. Not at all, I'm glad you stopped me. Did you eat the dumpling? It had shrimp in it. It's okay. Yeah? Because it was small...? What food do you hate? Black beans. They're like bugs. Bugs? But they taste so good. Then what do you like? Cotton candy! I can't put that in your lunch. There, cotton candy. Can I touch? Oh, stop it! Here. Bye. Have a nice day. Let's go. You saw it. I wanted to surprise you when I finished. Sorry. You're good at drawing. It's nothing. What a room. These are my treasures. That was the rabbit I had when I was in elementary school. A boy in my class, Miura, said I was creepy for getting my pet stuffed. And I guess people don't usually do it. But Miura couldn't even touch his pet parakeet when it died. He had his mom bury it for him. Where's the love in that? What right does he have to call me creepy, right? Yeah”. Is that you? Yeah. I've been drawing myself since I was ten. You can see my body maturing as well as declining over time. I thought it was kind of stupid at first. But after so long, I came to treasure it. 30 years, now. True, 30 years is pretty amazing. Where's your ring? Oh, I put it away. Oh. Where did I put it? What are you doing? Oh, nothing. I was just thinking how pretty this was. How was school? Did you have fun? Why don't you use a pencil? What's wrong? Where's your pencil case? Wataru took it. He's a really bad one. Remember Hikari's bruised eye? That was Wataru's fault, too. But no apologies. I just hope she's not being bullied. Bullied? Will you talk to the school about it? Wouldn't it be weird if I went alone? Weird? We just got remarried. They might think I'm trying too hard to act like a mom. You are a mom, Koharu. I'm a little tired, you know. You like to bite my finger, huh? Hikari! What's wrong? Can I sleep with you? Hikari said Wataru stole it. Well... Is it an expensive pencil case? Vice Principal, it's not about the price. The problem is that it was stolen. Rather, that the school couldn't deal with the situation. Yes, of course. Please, forgive us. We need you to support our vulnerable children. Of course. We will be more careful... What do you mean, are you saying it's my child's fault? It's your responsibility! Excuse me for a moment. I told you to stop doing such dangerous sports! Are you going to keep making them do flips on the bars? This teacher is crazy! My child came home with a huge bump on his head. I told you before! That was some helicopter parent. Unbelievable. You can tell she didn't have a good education. Poor teachers. Dr. Izumisawa, I was just hoping to see you. About the vaccinations. Oh yeah, for the new influenza strain. My, what a pretty young wife. We owe so much to Dr. Izumisawa. I'm the school physician here. Could you wait for me in the car? Shall we? Mrs. Izumisawa! Yes? I understand you must be busy. If you can't manage to make her lunch, we will order one for her at school. What do you mean? Hikari cries about it. That you won't pack a lunch for her. Is Wataru coming over to apologize? When? Soon, I think. But he's a liar, so who knows? Forgive us. Say sorry, Wataru! I didn't do it. You did. I didn't! I'm so sorry. It seems like he's lost it... It's fine. It's a chance to rethink how we rear our children. I told you, I didn't do it! Wataru! - I didn't! - Apologize! For what? I'm sorry. I didn't. - Apologize! - I didn't do it! Here. Ends up, only the parent apologized. And that mother was only saying it to get it over with. What a pathetic parent. I wonder how Wataru feels about Hikari. What do you mean? Boys tease the girls they like, right? So... You're saying he did it because he likes her? I don't know, but crushes make people do silly things. Even with little kids. When I was little, the boy I liked always teased this other pretty girl. And I was really jealous of her. I wanted to be teased, too. I wonder if that's what's going on. Hikari likes Wataru. What? She told me before. No way. Impossible. Infantile regression? Asking to be held. Wanting milk instead of food. She won't dress herself or dry her hair. And the bed wetting. Bed wetting? It's a pretty bad case of infantile regression. Infantile regression, huh... It happens often when parents remarry. They start acting spoiled. For now, the best thing to do is to spoil her. She wants to be forgiven no matter what. To make sure you're on her side. She's testing your motherly love. She'll grow out of it. Should I do something for her? No need. Just be her mother. Just be her mother... Here, open wide. Now this arm. Bye now. Have a nice day. I'm going to try for Waseda University. No way? You were that smart? Dai's a really good teacher. The best tutor ever. Right there. It looks easy, but it's actually pretty hard. Pulling the arm through? What's that? Your dad's debut as an encoffiner. Watch, Koharu. See, it's me. This is someone's funeral, right? He's gotten way too used to it, doing funerals every day. If you become a ghost yourself, ghosts won't scare you anymore. Stop being creepy. Everybody gets too used to where they stand, no matter where that is. Even if something upsets you at first, you're numbed after time. Would you like some beer? You don't have to, Dai. Koharu would've gotten it. It's fine. Hikari, use your chopsticks. Wow, Hikari. You're like a wild animal. Hikari. Use your chopsticks. Hikari! I don't want any. - Here you are. - Thanks. Dad. It's about Hikari. She's going through infantile regression. Infantile regression? Acting spoiled, rebelling. I don't know what to do. What does Dai say about it? That it's normal and it happens when a parent remarries. Then don't worry about it. The doctor knows best. Talk to me. I don't know anything about Hikari. What she likes, her favorite color... Not even what she hates. I have to understand her better. That's not what parenting is. I don't really know much about you, either. But still, I'm your father. They must serve healthier foods here. Why aren't you pregnant yet? Don't you want one of your own? Hikari is my own. Are things working out with her? Yes, very much. Okay. I don't want you to fail. Like me. You see... Daigo hates me. This expensive retirement home in a beautiful environment. Top quality service and even an indoor pool. I don't need any of it. He just deserted me in a socially acceptable way. Of course not... I don't blame him. I'm the one that hurt him. Daigo was bullied in elementary school. So we transferred schools so many times. But there will be bullies everywhere you go. One day... Daigo cried and screamed that I don't do anything for him. And he just wouldn't calm down... SO I hit him. He became almost deaf in his left ear. Don't be like me. Be a mother who is loved. Stop it. This costs a million yen. You don't have that money. Liars get their tongues cut off by the King of Hell. My dad is friends with him, so I'm safe. Yeah right. Can you fix it? Uh-huh. Look what was stuck in here. How does anybody accidentally flush a pencil case? What are you doing, Kurumi? I'm staying to study with Wataru. Can I join you? Sure, if it's okay with Wataru. You can't wear those today. Wear these. No. - I said, no! That hurts! - Hikari, please! You'll tear it, stop! - Hikari, come on! - Stop it! You're tearing it! - Stop it! - Take those off! FUNERAL FOR THE LATE KURUMI KOBAYASHI Koharu. You shouldn't have let her come in red shoes. She wouldn't listen to me. It's your job to make her listen. Yes, I know. Proper manners. Or they'll think you're a bad parent. I know that! I know that already. - Koharu. - What? The cleaner's tag. It's melting. Did you say goodbye to her? She'll be watching over you from heaven now. Kurumi always got in my way. In your way? Maybe that's why it's game over for her. It's mine. Don't eat it. She's a girl, she was just interested in your makeup. Can't you forgive her? Makeup is expensive. Expensive? You can just buy more... That's not the point! Hikari... She might not be a good girl. What do you mean? You're saying it like Hikari did something bad. Have a nice day. Okay. It's chilly today. Don't catch a cold. How many? How many in all? Hikari. How was your lunch? It was good. - The pickled plum rice balls too? - Yeah. Those pickled plums are expensive ones from Prof. Kyoda. They're good, huh? I'm really sorry. It's nothing to worry about. Just a little cold. Sorry for calling so late. We'd jump through scorching flames for our loved ones. That's what we parents are here for. What a really nice husband. You must be happy. I'm so jealous. I don't think I can anymore. Can what? My husband was cheating on me. I'm going to leave him. I mean, the twins will be born in just two months. What's going to happen to me? What's going to happen to you? Haven't you considered your kids' feelings or futures? Selfish much? Divorce, just like that? Where's your responsibility as a parent? What gives you the right to tell me that? Dai isn't nearby, is he? No. What's wrong? I'm scared of the exams. Dai acts like grades are everything. He said the school I was considering for backup was trash. That if I wanted to become trash without a proper education, the time he spent tutoring me was a total waste. I didn't have to aim higher. But Dai made me feel like I had to do better and better. I can't... I'm not that smart. I'm scared. What should I do? Don't ask me. It's your future. What about you? Are you okay? About what? Nothing, just asking. Hey. Uh-oh, you broke it! What are you going to do? That's Papa's treasure! He'll be so mad at you. You've done it now! I'm telling Papa! - You've done it now. - No... I'm telling Papa. You've done it now. I'm telling Papa. You've done it now. I'm telling Papa. Shut up! Ow...! That hurt! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hikari. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, so sorry. Hikari, I'm so sorry. Please, please. Don't tell Papa, okay? Please? Okay. I won't. I heard. I can forgive you for the broken ear. It was an accident. It's just stuffed, anyway. I'm sorry. But hitting Hikari is not an accident! Koharu. Maybe you don't love her enough. You think she's just a stranger's kid. No, I... You're her mother! Do you understand that? You are Hikari's mother. How dare you hit her. My precious daughter. Forget about the meat! Leave “m Is that more important than her? For crying out loud. Is eating all you can think about? Seriously. What a disappointment. Damn it. I... Um... "The future destiny of a child is always the work of the mother." The words of Napoleon Bonaparte. How much effort you put in. How you approach her. That defines Hikari's future! You've failed as a mother. You're a failure. Please leave. - But” - No buts. I didn't think you were like that. No, no! Don't go, Mama! Please don't go! Mom! I quit being your mother! Don't go! Mama, please... Don't go! Mama! I'll never become a parent like you. Mama? Hikari... I'm sorry, Hikari... No, Mama don't go! Mama, don't go! Are you okay, Grandpa? Lucky you. I wish somebody would take care of me, too. And why would I do that? Come on, you're my daughter. It's going to cost you. What, it's not for free? No... No...! No... You... I'll show you how it's done. Mommy, help! Hey, stop that! Let's go. Come on. You've failed as a mother. We're a family now! You'll be my Mama? I want to help you. I'll make Dai and Hikari very happy! It's thanks to you that I'm alive. If it were anybody else, I might've been dead. Dai... Let's go home. Let's all sing together Together, hand in hand La la la, little ducks All students and faculty members. Thank you for your services. I'm Hikari Izumisawa's father, Daigo Izumisawa. And her mother, Koharu. We regret to say this, but somebody stole my daughter Hikari's shoes. What? Who are you? What do you want? Raise your hand if you did it. If you do, we won't scold you. We're in the middle of class. Please stop. Stop? A crime has been committed. Mr. Izumisawa! What are you doing? I'm looking for the child that stole my daughter's shoes. I'd come out now if I were you. Hold on a second, Mr. Izumisawa. Please, calm down. You're the one that needs to calm down. How about we go to the faculty room? And do what? We can talk this over. My daughter said they were stolen at school. Isn't it natural to think the culprit is at school, too? "Culprit" is such a strong word... Am I wrong? Well... But out of common sense, you can't just use the PA system... Common sense? Where's your common sense in singing songs when a crime has been committed? We had to use the PA system, or you would've done nothing. You would've brushed it off. A crime is a crime, no matter the age. It cannot be dismissed. Principal. I know who pushed Kurumi. It was Hikari. I saw Hikari push her! I really did! I'm not lying! Kurumi's fall wasn't an accident. She was pushed and was killed! Do you mean that? I mean it! I'm not lying. Hikari pushed her! Hikari killed her! I saw it. I really saw it! My child would never! Kurumi always got in my way. Maybe that's why it's game over for her. They're all idiots. I hate dealing with idiots. Yes. Truly. So... we don't have to ask her, do we? I hate you! Why are you asking me if I pushed her? You think I'd do that? No, I don't! We just want to believe you. You only say that because you don't! Wataru's a liar! I know, he's sick. He's a pathological liar! I'm never going to school! - No, you have to. - Let go of me! What for? School is for stupid people! And you're right. I used to think so too. But listen. Society doesn't think so. If you don't go to school, society will think you're trash! I don't want people to think that! Me neither! Let's make some new friends, how about that? Yeah, why not? Sure they're all stupid. But friends are friends, right? Playing with idiots is fun. I hate everyone! I'm not going to school! I wish I were never born. I'm just in the way. Of course not. Yeah, you say that! But I know somewhere you think I am! And you'll keep thinking that. You don't need me! I'll never be happy anyways! How can you say that? Then make me happy! See, you don't do anything! You can't do anything! Stop it! I don't need you Mama, or you Papa! Dai! I... I just love you and Mama. That's all. Dai! Why? Those are your treasures. Treasures? Yeah right. All I need is Hikari. There's still the future. What else can I do for her? MURDERER, FAKE FAMILY NOUVEAU RICHE, LUNATICS EVIL FAMILY, IDIOTS, DIE It's okay. Hikari is a good girl. I know that. But... What should I do? They say God only gives us challenges we can overcome. I don't care about any God. You're right. I promised I'd make you and Hikari happy. But gosh. I'm no good, huh. What else can I do? What else... What else...? VACCINATIONS FOR THE NEW INFLUENZA THREAT INSULIN FOR HIKARI I KNOW YOU DIDN'T KILL HER. EVERYONE KNOWS! Who can solve this problem? Me! Hikari. What's the answer? I think it's 36. That's right! You're so smart, Hikari. Let's see if you can answer the next one. Remember, I taught you this. Come on, you can do it. I know, it's 78! Good job! You're so smart, Hikari. Okay, let's move on to science. I want to do reading. Okay, let's do reading then. Please take out your textbook. See, I brought my textbook. You're so smart, Hikari. There's a poem in here I really like. Then will you read it for us, Hikari? Yes, ma'am. "I can open my arms wide, but I can't fly at all. But the bird that can fly can't run fast like me. I can jiggle and shake but I can't make pretty sounds. But that ringing bell doesn't know many songs like I do. Bells, birds, and me. We're all different, and we're all great." What a wonderful job you did. You're so smart, Hikari. I'm me. Papa is Papa. Mama is Mama. That's how it should be. Thank you. You're so smart, Hikari. Every girl carries with her this same vague fear. "Will I live to be happy?"
