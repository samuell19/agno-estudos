I was nine when we left Afghanistan. We walked for one month in the desert heat to get to Peshawar in Pakistan. Then two planes and a boat through Malaysia till we finally got here. Farah... ..she's not just my cousin, brother, she's basically my sister. She was only five when both of her parents died in a car bombing at the American embassy in Kabul. They were both translators. Usually they... they did different shifts. But that day they decided to... ..to catch the bus home together. It was their anniversary. We took her into our family and left soon after that. Actually, I... I carried her most of the way here from Afghanistan. I told her, "I'll always protect you." "No matter what, I'll always be there for you." You know what I mean? Look, bro... ..if you really like Farah, then I'm OK for you guys to hang out. I'm fine. It's alright. Just... Just... Just don't say stuff like "she gave me a wristy" and don't degrade her like that. I was just talking shit. It never happened. It doesn't matter anyway, hey? What do you mean? She just texted me. She said she's seeing someone else. Bullshit. Ask her who it is. Bro, come on. I'm not gonna ask... Fucking ask her! OK. Chill. Fuck's sake. There. It's sent. What does she say? Bro, I just texted her. What about now? Don't forget. Condensed milk from the Indian shop. Not Woolies. Got it. Robi... Don't be late. I know. OK, Ma. You have one new message. Hi, it's Farah. So, I just told Dino about us. He asked pretty directly, and I just couldn't lie again. Hope that's OK. Fuck. I don't know. Anyway, buzz me when you can. Yeah? Bullshit, brother. You know what I mean? Why is he doing that? Well, come straight to my face. If you're a man, you come straight to my face. In my culture, if there's an issue or something, you want to date someone, you go up to him and say, "Bro," you know, straight out. Like, "There's something between us," blah, blah, blah. This bloke doesn't have any respect. It's a little sister. It's a cousin. I mean, you don't respect her. That means you're trying to do the shifties. You know what I mean? Where is this bloke anyway, cuz? He gets a little cut on his head they take him to ER. What a joke, brother. Shh. Why are you touching me? Don't touch me. Relax. Far out, bro. Yeah? I've seen people with their legs lopped off, they walk home. This one gets a little cut on his head, he's trying to hide. What do you want? I know he's hiding. Where have you been? I brought rasgulla. Oh, for Christ's sake. He can't eat. I'm sorry. How much do Anjali and Aditi know? Excuse me. We're only allowing family here. She's his wife. I'm his wife of 40 years. Welcome to Australia 50 years post-White Australia policy. Yeah, they let people from different races fuck now. I only told your sisters it was serious. I just couldn't. Why don't you go home, have a quick shower and come back? I'll call you if anything changes. I can manage. Alright. No-one said you couldn't. Baba. Look what I brought. What have you got there? Just sweets. They're his favourites. What's he saying? I don't know. He only spoke to us in English. People often revert to their native language in their final days. It's OK, Baba. I'll find out what's bothering you. We'll need an interpreter. I'll log the job, but it's late. Please. What language? Hindi? Bengali. We might not have someone until the morning. OK, Ma. I don't want the guests to think you are useless. Alright. Alright. OK, Ma. Robi... Back home, you know what I mean? I mean, you came... at least, you know, you were a gronk about it, but at least you were straight up. Anyway, cuz, he gets a little cut on his head, they take him to ER? What a joke. Far out, bro. Brother, I've seen people with their legs lopped off, they walk home. Yeah? This guy gets a little cut on his head. He's trying to hide. I know he's hiding. What do you want? Were you just speaking Bengali before? Yeah. Why? I really need a favour. Hey, it's urgent. What did I do, bro? You got angry at me. Baba? Look who I ran into. It's nephew... Uh, Robi. ..Robi, Baba. What were you trying to tell me? What's he saying? Not sure. Maybe it's a different dialect. Sorry. What's he saying? My Bengali is not that good. You're lying. What did he say? I need to know. You would let an elder of your community be lost in translation on his deathbed? No wonder your mother thinks you're useless. Your father wants to die at home. Oh, God. It's never enough. No. Not die at your house. In India. Your father wants to die in India. Yes, I know. I told you to go home. And now I'm telling you, I need you to come back. Like now. Sorry? Mum? No, the reception's shithouse. Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Want some? It has vodka in it. Sweet. Robi. Short for Rabindranath? It's alright. I used to do the same thing. I called myself Ash. I even teased my father about his accent. Now I'm always Ashmita. So, what did you do before your dad got sick? I was a singer in a punk band. How'd that go down with an Indian father? When I toured Europe he told family in India I was on a study tour. But, you know... ..because I never settled down, when he got sick, I was the only one who could care for him. So I came home. And you're getting too old to be in a band. You punk-ass kid. I'm your elder. You're supposed to respect me and call me Didi. By the time you get the whole respecting elders thing... ..it's... ..it's too late. Baba. Baba. We can still try. Hello, uncle. What do you wanna say? Baba... ..you were so fearless in coming here. Baba. You are the most radical, bravest person I will ever know. I hope in the next life I get to be your daughter again. Is your dad a Hindu? Sort of. The kind that eats Big Macs, and is too lazy to practice. Do you know any prayers, mantras or anything to, like, focus his thoughts and help him have a peaceful journey? No. Oh... Yeah. Mamo Chitte. If you ever need anything. Goodbye, Rabindranath. Goodbye... Didi. What's her name? Hmm? Her name. Harvin. Papa. Who's this? Look. Wow. Who drew that? Oh. Look at that. Hmm. Good boy. Hmm. I can sing in English. Oh. So cute. So cute. Put the seatbelt, please. They wouldn't pull you in for no reason. Yeah - the reason is that they are racist dogs. Why didn't you just show them your bag? I said I'll show you my bag if you get everyone in the shop to show their bag too. Otherwise, fuck off. If you've got nothing to hide, who cares? That's because you didn't see the way the security lady grabbed me. I was standing there and she grabs me like this. Meanwhile, next to me, there was a dickhead, he has a big-enough suitcase, he could have fitted a couple of blenders and MacBooks in there - they don't bother checking him. You could have just gone to Westbury instead of coming all the way to the city. I was going to swing by yours after and see your new car. It's been about a month and you still haven't brought it around yet. Are you scared someone's going to steal your tyres or something? You know, you only act this hard when you're in the city, but here out west, you're a good boy. You play with your Pokemon cards and... Yeah, well, I don't collect Pokemon cards anymore. I collect money. Ooh! Whose money is this? Relax. I didn't steal this. I'm just fucking with you. I know it's not yours because you don't have a job. It's Dad's. He wants me to go buy a vacuum. Yeah. Bullshit. You know he never picks up. I'm going to tell him everything that you did at the shop when we get back. Tell him. He can't lecture me any more than you have already. It's doing my head in. Do me a favour. Get rid of the ratty. It looks dirty as hell. Don't even talk about my hair. Where did you get the shiny suit from? Tarocash? This is Hugo Boss, yeah? And nothing wrong with looking nice. If you dressed a bit better, you wouldn't be in trouble as much. Wow, is that all it takes? You know, I can't wait to become a banana like you and live in Surry Hills. Why do Viets always put other Viets down when they get a bit of success? Is that why you moved out? Me and Dad were holding you down, huh? I don't hear you complaining when I'm paying for the roof over your head. Tom speaking. MAN: Tom. How you going, mate? Tom? Been looking for you. You round the office? Gazza, mate. Just had to run a few quick errands. Oh, OK. You're not joining us for lunch? No, mate. I had to step out of the office for a little bit. You fellows go on without me, hey? The cost benefit assessment's got to be in by the end of the day. You're coming back? Yep. They'll be done. Alright, boss, I've gotta head. I'll see you soon. Hang on, Tom. I've been telling Jimbo about your impersonations. It's a classic. He's here with me now, and I've got you on loudspeaker so you can do the voice. No, mate. I've, uh... I can't do that right now, hey? I've got a bit of company. Go on, Tom. I've heard that voice is a cracker. I don't know, mate. Alright. You're not getting all PC on us now, are you? You want a special fry rai-eece? Told you. Just like that takeaway. That's very good, mate. Good job, mate. Alright, you bloody jokers. I'll see you in the office in a bit, hey? Alright, Tom. Shit. Oh, fuck. You right, bro? I swear, this bloody pothole, it's been there for, like, three years now. Nothing gets fixed around here, and everyone's happy to live like this. But because I want to make something better for myself, I'M a banana? Fuck! Motherfucker. Shit. You'll be fine. Just go steal some new tyres again. What? What's that supposed to mean? As if you don't remember. Like, ages ago, bro. When you used to have that Corolla and you needed new tyres for it. You went to Hertz rental, hired out exact same model Corolla, took the tyres off, put your ones on it and returned it. You remember? No. I don't know nothing about no Hertz. Yeah, right, Mr Solid Citizen. Get inside, dickhead, before I hurt you. Yeah? Told ya. What do you want to eat? How about... ..special-ah flowas? Watch it, dickhead. Hey, you know what's funny? I swear, if you say something stupid, I'm going to throw you off the roof. No, I was walking home the other day and I saw a fucking Hertz Corolla coming off the road, skidded into a power pole, and I thought, what if that was the car you put your bald-arse tyres on? Shit. Were they alright? So you DID steal those tyres. So what if I did, then? I should rip this fucking ratty off your fucking head. Far out, bro. I got to fix my hair again. Oi! Stop. Oi, Robi. What's up, man? Oi! Stop! Hi, Tom. Hey, it's Tuan. Yeah, I won't be able to make it back into the office today. Why not? I cover the team all the time. You guys can cover me this once. What about the report? Nah, mate. Not doing it. Ladies? This is not the mall. Socialise in your own time. Of course, Sharon. We were just finishing up. And remember to speak English in the workplace. Emergency is short-staffed. They've asked if anyone wanted to work a double. I'll do it. Happy to. Excellent, Roxanne. Report in 15. Did you... did you lose consciousness at all? Uh... no. Do you feel dizzy? Your balance, it's OK? Yeah. OK. I'd like you to stay here for an hour or so... ..just so we can observe you. An hour? Don't worry. I don't think you have a concussion, but we need to be safe. It's my mum. Always answer when it's your mother. Oh, yeah. These forms are never-ending. Mm. Oh... Mm. What are you doing, standing around? The last time I checked, your shift wasn't over. Can I have a word? Mm. I presume you've heard. About what? The baby. The kidnapping in Maternity today. Grandmother took a newborn right out the door. Is the baby OK? Still missing. The police are coming to take statements, so I'm working my way through everyone that was on. Can you believe it? What a stuff-up! How was Salve today? She seemed... distracted. Roxanne? It wasn't Salve. What do you mean? Don't answer that. There'll be an investigation. FACS will have to get involved. She... The woman was so gentle with her. Oh, shit. Let me do the talking. It'll be OK. Hi. Hi. What's your name? Zenko. Hi, Zenko. I'm Roxanne. Um... Where are your parents, little one? Lost. OK, anak, OK. Uh, who's here? Who did you come in with? Baba. He's hurt. OK, anak, now... ..can you tell me what colour the stickers on the wall near him were? Hmm. I think green. Let's find them, huh? OK. Come on. It's OK. Let's go find them, huh? It's OK. Any news about the baby? Mama! Wow! Make a wish. I know you like juicy watermelons! But why do we have to drive for 40 minutes? Mrs Li sells them down the road. We need to remember this number. Ma! OK, fine. What...? Alright. What are you up to? You're dragging me out here to this wasteland on our busiest day? Tonight is not the ending. Tom women are strong. We always find the next big thing together. We can have a garden here. Grow our own melons. With your hard work and my brains, our business will be big success. This is our future. The countryside. This is your idea of the countryside? Maybe they'll throw in a pony if we ask. Stop being funny. Everything I say is funny to you. All my life, I've slaved - in China, in Burma, and in bloody Lucky Pig! With the restaurant gone, we will buy into this perfect house to live in. Just you and me. Oh! Oh, my God! All I want is to have a life with my thamee until the day I die. Am I allowed to be happy? No, not when you plan batshit things like this by yourself. Like always. Batshit? Shit? Shit is you! The restaurant wouldn't even be closing if you'd actually listened to me. People only thought we were special because of my Burmese desserts. We work in a Chinese restaurant. I can't do this anymore. Where are you going? I'm moving to Melbourne next month, with Elliot. Idiot! Elliot. Ell-i-ot. We've been together for five years and you still don't care enough to learn his name. I know his name. Elliot is idiot! Mwah! Thank you. Seriously? It's OK. It's OK. It's alright, little girl. Please, Gracie. Oh... Oh. Hello. My restaurant's just there. Why don't you come inside? There we go. Hey. You want to grab a seat? Is it... Amirah? Amirah. Amirah. Hey, Amirah? Come here. Wow! Your grandkids are cute, cute, cute! Aunty Winnie will bring you something yummy. No charge. They're in some kind of trouble. The baby looks newborn. Maybe we should call someone. Come on, darling. Come on. Come on. Good girl. Say thank you? Hmm? What do you think? Hey? Hey. That's yours now. Da-da! Go, Leslie! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to dedicate my last song to my beautiful Winnie. Aww. You know, Ma and her family... ..they were the only Chinese immigrants in their neighbourhood in Yangon. She said it made her feel less alien when she learnt to cook every dish to perfection. And she made me love cooking. Ma taught me how to make the best kulfi in Sydney. She rarely ever talks about where it came from, though. Her home. That's Mr Chatterjee. He used to cut my hair, after I graduated from bowl cuts. His fave dish is taro duck, and he tips if the skin is extra crispy. That's Sally Tran. Her little sister, Jenny, gave me a nosebleed in kindy and Ma went... she went fully She-Hulk on her. Sally's nicer, though. She loves my falooda. Angel... What are you saying? Crazy day. Screaming in the countryside. Crying baby. Karaoke. Well, because I will be closing. 15 years. This restaurant lasted longer than your marriage. It could have had another 15 if it wasn't for those bloody gentrifiers. Ma... I'm never gonna live in the countryside with you. But if you need a lift to get your juicy watermelons... But... aren't you and Elliot...? All I know is I don't want to be far from home. For now. Of course! Your ma is getting old. Very weak, with creaky bones! Oh... Who else would carry my watermelons, huh? I know. Captions by Red Bee Media Copyright Australian Broadcasting Corporation
