He was working with computers, but now he?s unemployed again. I?m waiting for something. Madalena has not been here for over a month. She was supposed to come for Chico, but the boy waited for the mother the whole day, sitting there on the couch. I called her, but she didn?t answer. I called you too. She had to help my sister at the hospital. Couldn?t she warn us? ?If she could, she would. I should have taken a picture of Chico?s face waiting for his mom. - She?s crazy about her son. - She?s crazy! - My boy, my boy... - Now I have to play. - Want a sip? - No, I stopped. - Stopped? - I stopped. - Really stopped? - I did. - Did you become a believer? - I did. You went to the police, have you talked to her sister? Yes, I went to every possible place. Our marriage never worked out, we didn?t get along. She never told me anything about that. If she vanished, it wouldn?t make any difference. I mean, it would. It would be good. Really. At bottom, if she vanished it would be good. It would be good to Chico, it would be good for me. If she vanished... If you vanished... - Sure you don?t wanna go? - No. I want. Wake up! They?re looking for you down there. So, Elon, is everything alright with you? It?s alright. So, please, sit here. Feeling bad? Are you sick? No. So why did you sleep at work? It was a slight negligence Not quite, since it has happened before. Why you didn?t come on Tuesday? - Because I had some issues at home. - And you couldn?t have called? Were you drunk? No. - Are you sure? - No is no. You?re a loser. Hey Sandra, get Elon?s docs. He?s in front of me. It?s a dismissal for cause. What do you mean? No, wait, I?II see that over there. Is everything fine? No, not at all. Where have you been? I?ve been around. - What do you mean? - I?ve been around. Do you want me to tell you a story? - What do I do with you, huh? - Everything! What?s the problem? Want some coffee? No. Give me a cigarette? Madalena?! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Mr. Elon...? - That?s me. We?ve got a search and seizure warrant with us. - Why? - We got an accusation. Can I see it?

Huh, now? I can, I can. Ok, ok... Ok, alright. It?s allowed smoking here, right. You can?t get out now. You?ve got to wait. I don?t understand what?s going on. I?m the one who doesn?t understand what?s going on, Mr. Elon. You come here, makes a police report telling your wife is missing, messes up yesterday with the day before yesterday. And now you wife?s sister, Ms. Jasmin, denounces you for breaking into her house. What were you doing there? I?m asking you, why did you break into her house? Mr. Elon? I thought Madalena was there. So you confess breaking into her house?! No. - Do you work? - Yes. - Where? - I'm a guard. - And is everything fine at work? - Yes. - Is it really? - Yes. You got fired. Why are you lying, Mr. Elon? You are lying. Of course not! So why did you lie to the police officer that went to your home - telling you wife was there? - She was there. Was your wife at home, Mr. Elon? They got there and there was nobody. Why did you say your wife was at home, Mr. Elon? Do you have anything to say, Mr. Elon? So Mr. Elon, this is the thing: a body was found today and it has you wife?s features. Skin color: white. Hair: straight, dark-brown. Height: 1.78m exactly. Weight: 65 Kgs.
