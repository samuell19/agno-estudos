Done! But somewhere with a mixed clientele. I know a "fine restaurant" just for that. Strange, a ring vanished from the box. Did you notice something? There?s no one but you who has a key? The cashier bears no guilt! How do you know, Mr. Engineer? I will find out! Erni always found an excuse to be with Ferdl. I?d do anything for you! ANYTHING? Then come!

I?ll tell you when he arrives! A nice ring! If only it was genuine! Married? That would be nice - but the likes of us never get out of the Elektric! And if someone might help you? Would you be drawn back? Back? No ... never!!! Why do you burden my heart? That can?t ever happen! I want to check what pretty girls are here! They all have to come! Ah ... Mr. Engineer. Mr. G?ttlinger ... I ask you not to bother the lady anymore! Haha ... Lady!!! You?ll pay for that! That is ... my ring, you fine gentleman! Who gave you the ring? That is him! He gave the ring to me! You ratted on me! I?ll pay you back! YOU ...! You?re coming with me! Come Hansi ... away from here! You shall never return to the Elektric! Will you come to me ... forever? You went stealing for that rascal? You did that to me? Me, your father?! Father?! I never had a father! You never cared for me. ... I tell you! I will always live like I want to!
