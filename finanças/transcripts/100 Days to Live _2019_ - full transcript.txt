Hi, Tanya. Hey, Max. I was up all night. And I got out a buncha pills and I was just staring at 'em, you know? But, I'm too much of a pussy to... to actually do it. But I wanted to, you know? I guess that's why we're all here, right? Not following through doesn't make you weak, it makes you strong. Okay? Fred, what you're feeling right now is so common. Trust me. Yeah, because wanting to die is just a rage that's sweeping the country right now. Every 10 minutes someone in America kills themselves. - It's true. - Do you really think something like this, that therapy, can help? Can I tell you a story? My mom, she was... She was always angry and sad and one morning when I was nine she killed herself. And I have wished every morning since that she would have had the strength to walk in that door like you guys did. To meet people, because I know it makes a difference. So, I was thinking. Maybe you could get your own clinic and then your hours would be better. You know I need to be on the front line. And, you know, I was thinking one of us should probably have a full time job. Is that a dig at my retired lifestyle? No. But you know I have to do what I do. So, I know we've only been dating for a few months, but they've been amazing. Yeah. And I know you get down on yourself, but I've seen what's really inside of you and it's wonderful. And strong and... Now, don't freak out. For right now the only thing that can make me any happier is if you were to say yes. Yes. Yes. I love you. I love you, too. She said yes. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Good morning. Morning. Now that we're gonna get married maybe we should think about getting a dog or a cat. What about a cat? Ye... I.... Cats are cute. - Cats are cute. - But they just kinda sit - there and litterboxes are- - I know, but they purr. Yeah, dogs are much cuter. - Sure. - Fetch it, then bring it back. Kitties purr. We'll talk about this when I come back. Yeah, okay. Love you. May I use the ladies room? Where is it? Thank you. I'm Detective Neese. I'm assigned to your case. How you holding up? What happened to Gabriel? Okay, um... I'm just gonna level with you. Your fiance's the latest victim of a known criminal. He stalks his victims for months, takes pictures of what seems to be everywhere they go, everything they do. Then he drugs and kidnaps them and leaves behind a scrapbook saying they were saved. We call him The Savior. What does he do to them, then? What does he do to them? He shoots them and dumps their bodies. Does this mean that Gabriel's dead? We don't know that yet. We're doing everything we can. No sightings yet. Humboldt Park, Englewood, Oak Park, nothing. How's it going in there? She had like an anxiety attack, poor girl. Think she's gonna be okay to do this now? Relatively speaking. Did you ask her? Ah, Jesus, come on. You didn't ask her. Hi. I'm Detective Byers. Please, have a seat. I, uh... I'm very sorry for what happened to you. I have a question for you that might seem a little odd. I have this theory that The Savior might be targeting people who have attempted suicide in the past. What? Two out of the three victims have suicide attempts. It's the only link we have between them. It's an unproven theory. Rebecca, did Gabriel ever try to kill himself? Yes. Yeah. He did. I run a suicide prevention group. That's where we met. He came in one day after my group session. I'm Dr. Church, you can call me Rebecca, I run the group. I'm Gabriel. Um, what's up? I... My wife and daughter died last year and... And I'm just... Just start talking. You can do that. I'm sorry, I can't do this. Just wait. Just wait, please! What's that? It's my number. I can tell there's more you need to say. Thank you. People come and go every night. I never thought I'd hear from him. - Hello? - Rebecca. Hi, you know, after I saw you tonight I think something clicked for me. I think I'm actually really starting to feel better. This is Gabriel, by the way. Uh, yeah, I know. Are you feeling manic? No, no. I actually feel relaxed. He seemed so positive. He asked me to have coffee and I said no, but he was so persistent so I agreed just to check in on him. He was already following him. Then what happened? He offered to make me breakfast. He wasn't a patient, so I agreed. We had a lot in common. We both had losses in our lives. Be prepared to be amazed. I'm just so freaking sick of being depressed. I mean, life is short, right? I don't know, I think I'm just having some sort of positive epiphany. Is that normal? Sometimes people just turn a corner. It can happen. I think it did. And I've done a little research on you, too. You've written a lot about suicide prevention. Most of that's from my doctoral research. For insomniacs it works wonders. I read an article, they called you The Wounded Healer. I can tell you still carry around a lot of that sadness. Do you mind if I use... Oh yeah, sure, go ahead. Just right on the corner. Thanks, bye. Hi, sorry, I just had a work call. So, what do you do for work anyway? I'm an option trader. Which basically means I steal money for a living. Oh, these were, uh... These were designed to hold guitars. I planned on learning, but with marriage and my kid and work, I never even bought a guitar. You know what? The new Gabe is retiring. Fuck options trading, I've got enough money. I'm sorry, I don't mean to keep dumping on you like this, it's just... I wanna buy guitars, I wanna eat great food, and do whatever the else I want for the rest of my life. I don't know, it just kind of happened. We were inseparable after that day. We just got engaged yesterday. Is there anything else you can remember? Anything you can tell us? This guy followed Gabriel for months. You are all over this thing. Wait a second. I mean, we're sleeping here, so... The Savior was inside my house? Yes, he's done that with a few of the other victims. He slips in and takes these photos. I remember this night. It was at my place, it was before I moved in with Gabriel. Maybe our fifth date. Did you leave the door open? - No. - It was open. Hello? So, I always ask my group what are you grateful for today? I just figured that it was an angry patient or a twisted practical joke. But it was him. He's never left notes before, why would he start? - Yeah. - I've been in this career my entire life. Maybe I know him. What? What is it? What's the matter? It's the guy with the camera. This isn't possible. - Is he a patient? - No, he's... Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's dead. We used to work together. Rebecca? Victor. Victor Quinn. I'm starting today. Yeah, welcome aboard. Thanks. No, I can imagine what it's like for you, all right? But I'm here and I'm listening, and right now it... Please, Henry, I'm still listening, all right? I'm still here, we don't have to figure this... He's in his garage with the car started. Henry, Henry, I need you to get out of the garage, okay? Henry! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Call 9-1-1. - 911, what's your emergency? - Hi, this is Victor Quinn, I'm at Chicago West Clinic. Subject is a male, he's in his garage with his car started. Hey, that's all we can do. They'll get there, okay? Yeah. But so often there just isn't enough time. You're fucking kidding me! This is fucking ridiculous. Jesus, I could've saved that guy if the cops just got off their ass. Sometimes the cops get there in time, sometimes they don't. It's how it goes. Victor was missing the next day. Hello? Victor, where are you? What are you doing? Apologizing. There are two people buried here that I failed. And 15 others scattered across the city. Some I talked to for hours. Some just once. You probably think I'm crazy, right? I just think you need to lighten up a little bit. Let's get outta here. Yeah. My boss thought I could help him. Be careful. I think this is the first time that oven's been used. This is my mom's recipe, she used to make them when I was little. When she killed herself I used to make 'em and they would just always make me feel better. What was it like, you know, after she died? Well, uh... I moved in with my dad who was an abusive drunk. Not a good guy. Anyway, uh... I take my meds and I feel like I've beaten it by helping other people. Yeah, you wanna help people, you can't just try. I mean, you have to succeed, you have to. What's in here? They're the people I've lost over the last 20 years. Some nights I don't sleep 'cause there's still so much I need to learn about helping people. I, uh, called your last employer. They said you were fired for getting fixated on callers. You see, why is it so hard for people to understand I was trying to save them- - I get it, I love your passion. But if you step out of line, Victor, I will not keep quiet. Fine. I begged the clinic to fire Victor, but nobody listened. I'm done. Please calm down, Maggie, I'm listening, all right? I'm still here! Are you still there? I'm tired. Fuck it... I'm gonna do it. Hold on. What are you doing? She's right around the corner. Are you crazy? Either you're in or you're out. Let's go. I'm calling 911. Maggie! Oh shit. Maggie, you need hospitalization. I'm so stupid. I stopped taking my medications a month ago. The second I kicked out the chair I knew I made a mistake. What medications were you on? I don't even know. It was a new one. Just promise me you're gonna get help now. For real. I will. I've spoken to him so many times, but never met him. I'll go to the hospital, but I wanna grab my journal first. Sure. See, this woman, Rebecca, she needed help and I saved her. I mean, not the system. Me. Victor, you haven't saved anybody, this is not about you. Maggie? God, where are the cops? Fuck. Maggie? No, no, no, no. I still regret every single thing about that day. And Victor disappeared. Victor! Victor! God! Victor, I'm here. You're all right. I understand now why people wanna die. I'm such a coward. Come on now, don't say that. I failed so many people. My god, Victor. This is not your fault. I mean, you're blaming yourself for things that are so far out of your control. Let me take you on as a client, okay? You'd do that for me? Of course. Come on, don't, don't- - No more of your bullshit! You know how many I've told people "Everything's gonna be okay" when I knew it wasn't? And to hell with all your gratefulness spiel. I can see it in your eyes you are just as fucked up as me. Please don't. Please. Stop it. It's all bullshit. Please don't. Please, Victor. Oh my god. Mr. Quinn is on a ventilator. His best case scenario is that he's what's called a persistent vegetative state. But with his wounds he's not gonna live very long. I'm very sorry. And when did this all take place? About three years ago. If he's dead, how is he in this photo? I have no idea, but it's him. Greg, check the hospitals to see if and when this victim Quinn died. - On it. - Let's roll some cars out to the last known address. You guys talk to Chicago West Clinic. Canvas the whole area, shop keepers, neighbors. This guy's on the move, we don't have much time. So, the house that Victor lived in is abandoned and the clinic that you both worked at is shut down. But two years ago a Victor Quinn applied for several jobs at multiple suicide prevention clinics. Did Gabriel ever call a suicide hotline? Honey, do you mind if I move your sweaters? Sure, go ahead. What is this? After my family died I would stick this under my chin. I've been meaning to get rid of it. You know, I almost actually did it one night. I called one of those suicide prevention hotlines. Talked to this guy, he talked me out of it. Saved my life. I don't even know who he was. That had to have been Victor Quinn. Possibly. Why haven't you guys found him yet? You have a picture of him. We're doing everything we can. And what can I do? Go home, get some rest. If you want I can provide a police escort, but you really don't need to stay here. Ma'am, come on. What are you doing here? Dad, when Chicago West shut down I think they sent some of my stuff here. Notebooks, papers. Do you remember that? Christ, you are your mother's daughter. Do you have any of the stuff? Give me your hand, honey. I'm leaving. Your box is in the basement. Have you spoken with the dead before, Rebecca? Victor. I knew you'd figure it out sooner or later. You're smart. I want you to know that I know that. Where is Gabriel? He's sleeping. He can't come to the phone right now. Why are you doing this? Because I survived. They said I was in a coma from brain bleeding. They said I was lucky to be alive. Lucky. For 100 days I couldn't move or speak, but I could feel pain. I was locked in. 100 days of agony, misery, and suffering. Help me, help me. Help me. I'm in... I'm in here! Can you hear me? 100 days to be tortured by those I failed. - I couldn't do it. - I'm coming, I'm coming! You failed us. - You failed us. - You failed us. - You failed us. - Failed us. You failed us. You failed us, you failed us. You failed us, you failed us. You failed us, you failed us. Then I woke up. Something changed inside of me. Hey, looking good, Mr. Quinn. You just keep on going, okay? Okay. Just, I'll see you around. And I grew stronger. One day I met a woman named Barbara. I'm waiting for a room. We're all waiting on something. I see what you did there. I'm going to hell. Yes, you are. Who are you? I have a solution for people like you. To fix your defective brain. What are you doing? Get away from her. Get back to your room, let's go. I'll see you again. Let's go. - I promise. - Now. Let's go, move it. Where is Gabriel? He's gonna be just fine. She talked to him. Victor Quinn is alive. I want Victor's phone pinged! Get that girl back in here. Cap, I'm showing her. The woman that Victor said he met at the hospital... Did he say her name was Barbara? Yeah. His first victim. Barbara Peters. We weren't sure how they met. After she left the hospital he took her in broad daylight. He left that by the steps. What did he do to her? This is how we found her. My god, Victor. Next victim. Tanya Williams. The same drug was found in her system. A boy in her apartment complex found this. We found her the next morning. Seven months later. Harry Parker was leaving work. The cleaning people found this next to his car. That's how we found him. Victor is angry at suicidal people, so he's killing those with suicide attempts. I'm gonna share something with you that we haven't made public. All of these victims were followed exactly for 100 days. Victor was in a coma for 100 days. We were stumped on that, that's why I'm showing you these. Yeah? Be right there. We might have a sighting. He's got multiple cell phones. Give me something good, Captain. It wasn't him. False alarm. - Shit. - Hey, you let her in the evidence room? - What are you- - Calm down, she knows the guy. Captain? Easy. Everyone shut up. I hope your police friends are getting off on our relationship. Victor. Please, whatever you're doing just... Please don't hurt him. I'll do whatever you want. I've been following Gabriel for months. Watched him fall in love with you. So, even though it's against my rules I wanted you to get a goodbye. After all, it's the least I can do for an old colleague. Victor. Wherever you are, just listen to me, okay? You're right. The police, they're listening to this, but I won't involve them, okay? Just come get me, all right? - I promise I- - Shut up! Just answer my questions. Do you love Gabriel? Yes. Yes, more than anything in the world. Is Gabriel strong? Yes. Is Gabriel happy? Yes. This isn't personal, Rebecca. Please. Victor, Victor. Are you there? He's not there. He's not there. She said yes. I wanna buy guitars, I wanna eat great food, and do whatever else I want for the rest of my life. Jack, I just realized something. I need a big favor. Thank you, you guys. Good week. Look at these pictures. Barbara Tanya Harry and Gabriel. What do you notice? They're happy, Jack. Look at their faces. Every one of them that was murdered had recovered in the months before they were killed. People who are deeply suicidal, they usually never recover like this, and these people did. Victor isn't killing them because they're suicidal, Victor's killing them because they beat it. Think about it, all right? You were there, you heard the phone conversation. Why else would Victor ask if Gabriel was happy? Happy? That's what you got? Okay, I need you to listen to me very carefully. Do not go around town sniffing out clues and asking victim's families questions without me. Long time no see. Should've left it alone, Rebecca. Had to go and play detective, didn't you? Rebecca? Rebecca! I know your secret. I'm gonna save you next. Fuck. Jack, come on. Come on. He's got my gear. It doesn't matter, we gotta go. Is there something you're not telling me? I mean, why is Victor coming after you now? Gabriel, are you sleeping? What are you doing? Babe. Are you okay? Hey, what's wrong? When I was 18 I took 40 sleeping pills. I woke up in a pool of vomit completely ashamed. But then I did it again in grad school two years ago. Babe, I'm cursed. Even when things are going great, I get really down. I still hate myself for it. Don't do that to yourself. Don't. He's out there. I know it. I think it's time to move you to a safe house now. No, I wanna stay here. This is where I feel safe. Okay. Let's make it safe here. Wa-la. Your apartment is now your safe house and I'm the gatekeeper. I have units downstairs in 20 minutes. Jesus! Rebecca, don't sneak up on me like that. What is it? I was thinking about it. How did Victor know that I tried to kill myself? Maybe Gabriel told Victor. No, no. That doesn't make any sense. Okay, so when Gabriel called the suicide hotline we didn't even know each other. Look, I don't know about the where, when, hows, all I know is I'm catching him, that's it. No, no. Victor... He's trying to tell me something. Who is that? It's an email from Victor. Do you understand yet? This is why I'm The Savior. He attached audio files to this email. I'm gonna play the file. Hey, doc, yeah, I'm on a first date with that girl I told you about who gave me her number. This is a recording of a phone call. I know, start it over. Uh, do you mind if I use... Oh yeah, sure, go ahead. It's just right on the corner. Gabriel. Yeah, I'm on a first date with that girl I told you about. The one I met last night who gave me her number. I am just so nervous. I'm not sure if I can do this. Just be yourself. If she's a counselor, she'll understand. Okay, all right. Thanks. Hi, sorry, I just had a work call. Play the next one. You know, this is my investment manager. I'll be right back. Hello? How's it going. Fifth date in seven days. This woman is incredible. She really is amazing. I don't know, do you think I'm really ready for this? You sound like a man in love. If you get anxious, just breathe, relax. Okay, will do. Thanks, doc. Talk to you later. Play the next one. Gabriel. Hey, doc. You got a second? Sure, what's going on? Oh, Rebecca's been real down lately. Just trying to cheer her up, get her out in nature, you know? Nice work, I'm proud of you. Thanks for always making me appreciate stuff like this. I get more out of your pleasure than you know. Play the last one. Guess what? I'm gonna ask her to move in with me. I really think I can do this. She's the one. Tell me, does Rebecca know you're speaking to me? No. No, she has no idea. I don't wanna shatter her confidence in me. Victor helps them and then he kills them. Gabriel was so vulnerable and he didn't want me to know. Since you're hiding behind the police, I thought we could chat. You see now? I want you to understand that I didn't kill Gabriel because he was happy. I'm the reason he was happy. Him and the others. All me. And why do you kill all them? You should come see me, Rebecca. I can help you. Yeah, I should. Give me your address so the fucking SWAT team can put you where you belong. You want my address. I assume it's in Gabriel's diary. Gabriel didn't keep a diary. As his therapist, I can assure you he did. Read the diary, Rebecca. It's on top of the world, just like he was. Top of the world. No! Months went by. I was losing my mind. I'm Dr. Church. You can call me Rebecca, I run the group. It's my number. I can tell there's more you need to say. Thanks. Here for Gabriel? Come on, come on, come on. Can you pull up, up, up, up, over here, right. Just right in... just right up here, please. Just... Suicide prevention, this is Victor. I need some help. Calm down and tell me where you are. I'm at, I'm at the tracks near Humboldt Park. My name is Dr. Quinn, Gabriel. I'm coming to you right now. You sounded like you needed me. I can tell who's serious and who isn't. You are. Where are we going? I'll take you to my house. I have something to show you. I'm not taking no for an answer. Please. Please, go ahead. Open it. Who are these people? These were all deeply suicidal people just like you. Now look how happy they are. Look at the joy on their faces. I helped all of them. How? Imagine you only had 100 days to live if you knew for sure that you would die in 100 days. What do you mean? The reason all these people are so happy is because they agreed to die after 100 days. On the 100th day, I drug them with sodium thiopental, and shoot them. Totally painless. And I photograph them, capturing all their joy. Imagine... Imagine a life, a short life, but full of passion, reckless abandon, adventure with no consequence. The suicidal mind is thus defeated. If you could have one thing in the world that would make you happy, what would it be? I wanna find love again. Then join me and you will. All right, I'll do it. Hello? Rebecca, hi. I'm the reason he was happy. You ready? Yeah. Don't fight it. Easy. Easy. I have a solution for people like you. - Yeah. - To fix your defective brain. Leave me alone. You knew you were gonna die. How could you do that to me? Why did you do this? Rebecca? Rebecca! Shit! Okay, girl. Come on, come on! Don't move. You'll be all right. You're lucky to be alive. We've read the diary. We know that Gabriel and all the other victims made deals with Victor. Gabriel didn't really love me. I know. I'm so sorry. We're gonna get him now. No, you're not. No, people want what he's selling. People like me. Do it, do it, do it. Good, you're awake. There are police in this hospital. Then scream. That's what I thought. Did Gabriel ever try to change his mind? Once. I just feel guilty about Rebecca. She's head over heels, I just feel like a bad person, and I don't know if I can go through with this. Then don't. I won't waste my time on nonbelievers. I'm giving you a taste of real life, but it's real only because of your control. Your control is the key. Either you are in or you're out. You know your joy will pass. It always does, it always does. I'm in. Get her an engagement ring. You'll feel better about yourself. I don't know who's worse. You or the victims who lie to those who love them. You're blaming me? During the 100 days you were with Gabriel, did love ever save you from the demons or did you still feel the pang of emptiness you felt ever since you were a kid? Be honest now. I still feel empty. Because you are empty. Like me. He or you could never escape the demons. I knew that from the moment I met you. What do you see when you fantasize about death? That I'm drowning. I don't know what's real anymore. I'm as real as you're ever gonna get. I live so people like us can die. I'm your salvation, Rebecca. Get out. Hey. Hey, Jack. Uh, I got the flowers. They're really pretty. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, no, I'm doing okay, you know? First day of the rest of my life, right? Actually, I was wondering. Would you wanna help me do some spring cleaning? It'd be nice to have the company. So, what's this? Gabriel and I, uh, we went to Manhattan a few months ago. Look, just don't give up, okay? You're gonna be fine. I'm so tired. - Then get some rest. - Yeah. I found my mom's body. She left me a rose, but no note. Are you okay? You were screaming. Yeah, I'm fine. Look, I'm here for you if you need me, okay? Just... Just leave, Jack. You know where to find me. They say when you hit rock bottom you just know. At that moment, I knew. I was ready. Hello, Rebecca. I'm so tired. Take down my address. Don't be afraid. I'm happy you came. I was nervous. Don't be. You made the right choice. Oh. Come here. Come, come. You made the right choice. I did make the right choice. It's lovely. Who called it in? An anonymous caller said from this house. Oh, shit. What is it? Nothing. What am I grateful for today? Honestly, I don't know. But I am alive and I am strong and I know I am never going to give up. I promise.
