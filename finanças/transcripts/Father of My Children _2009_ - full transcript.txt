It's me. Two hours with those Georgians. They talk so much! There's no stopping them. S?bastien isn't thrilled. I won't be stopping by the office. Fax the contract to my country house. What do you mean, no toilets? You must be joking. I hope they have mattresses! Thanks. Talk to the owner, not to that idiot! I'll call him if you want. Give me his number. This is Gr?goire Canvel from Moon Films. Like the moon. They're famous Korean movie people, used to being treated well. They can't live in such conditions. I'll have to cancel, then. I spoke to him. He'll work it out. If you go about it right, you can get him to go even lower. I'll call you back from the car. Any news from Sweden? - They're shooting this weekend. - No way. They did nothing on Wednesday because of the light. They spent yesterday preparing a ten-minute long take for today. They didn't shoot it? Yes, they did loads of takes, but Stig says the boy was distracted. He was out of it. So they're starting again tomorrow. And he doesn't like the set. He liked it the other day. He's changed his mind. He's fired the construction crew and says he's shooting somewhere he scouted, in secret. Gr?goire, if you allow this, there'll be no end to it. He won't listen to me! We need to get that budget under control. He's bleeding us dry. Can I see? - So, how did it go? - Greatl We did three hours of prep, two hours of overtime, and set up a light tower in the lake. That was something! Hey, Patrick the grip is a real hunk! How about the actors? I'm surprised they haven't lost it. Mostly they're patient, but when one complains, the others follow. Who's complaining? Julien. He thinks we pay too much attention to the principals. He says Damien shoots him wrong. He's a pain. Guess what. He wants a chair with his name. Don't exaggerate. He's not Tom Cruise. B?r?nice, I have to go. Another call. See you on Monday. It's me. Where are you? On the motorway. Almost. Should we wait for you? If you're not too hungry. It's Daddy. Daddy? Hello, darling. So, did you have a nice day? We're making a play. But you have to hurry because it's starting soon. Do you want to know the password? Tell me. Grilled carrots. I'll remember! I'll put Valentine on. How's my little brat? Is that you, pig face? So, can I come to the play? Maybe, but it'll cost you. It's probably beyond your means. What do you know about my means? My means know no endl Want it in cash or sweets? Cash, of course. Anything nice to tell me before I hang up? Mummy told Serge that you're "a human spam". Telltale! Put Mum on. They're excited. Well, see you later. Sylvia... Say something nice. Something nice? Girls! Daddy wants me to tell him something nice. Tell him you love him! His script is going before the committee. It's called Same Time Tomorrow. It's a project that's very close to my heart. Bulimic? That's a bit harsh... I understand, but at the same time... the directors I produce don't usually interest network TV. Nothing for the time being. No stars, we shoot in Tajikistan! Of course I remember! How much do I owe you? Is that all? Evening, sir. Police. Switch off the engine. Licence and registration, please. Here. Evening. - Do you know why I stopped you? - I have a vague idea. The speed limit is 90 km/h. You were doing 117. And with no seat belt. Did you know you'd run out of points on your licence? I wasn't aware of that. Step out of the vehicle and come with us. What a disaster... Valentine, it's Daddy. I'm a little held up. I'm nearby, but... At the moment I'm in a car with policemen. Exactly. I killed someone. Tell your mother. You've been a naughty boy! Don't forget your seat belt. I wish you'd seen how charming I was. I wish I had! We went to see Cocteau's tomb. The girls liked it. Especially the medicinal plant garden. I like the bell, but not Jean Marais' voice. You're wrong. It's a deep voice but very tender. It's moving. Daddy, you know, me and Billie went... "Billie and I". Billie and I went to the church to wait for you. As usual Billie forgot to shut the gate. The cat got out, and he started following us. And when Billie saw he was behind us, she cried and cried. Poor thing. She was screaming so loud, he hid under a car. So I dragged Billie back to the house, we opened the gate and Shaft ran back in. Unbelievable, isn't it? What's unbelievable? He followed us like a dog! He never does. They really screwed up! Honestly, with a title like that. "Hands Off". What were they thinking? Come on, look at the figures! Have a good weekend. Police! Hands up! Give me a kiss. Let me show you something in the garden. What? Something. Here it is! It's my little garden. I'll see better in the light but it's nice. There are plants and flowers. Roses... cycramel... Cyclamen. Cyclamel... - What else? - Thyme. The thyme... Where is it? There! No, there. And this... It's a flower-plant, sort of. I don't know. It looks like a flower-plant. - What's that? - I can't remember. Can you tell me? I have no idea. I did everything. The digging, the planting... - Did you water them? - They need water. Straight after I'd planted them. You made the fence with pick-up sticks? Don't listen to her, I'm the one who did everything! I'm the one who dug all the holes, who went to see the gardener. I did it all! - Enough now! - She's lazy! Big, fat liar! - Where's Cl?mence? - She's in her room. She never eats anything! - Just apples. - And tiny ones! First the big one, then... Small one on top. Here's a sort of cover. Seen what's in store for you? They're tireless. Cl?mence? That's three times I've called her. What's going on? I'm coming. I was just finishing my chapter. Sulking? But I'm not in a great mood. Why not? Because. Your daughter always seems annoyed. She's a worrier. Like you. When I worry, I know why. With her it's metaphysical. Not true. I just don't like the countryside. So that's it! I don't know why I have to come here every weekend. Other girls my age go out, do what they want. They don't all have a house with a big garden two hours from Paris. I'd be very pleased if you decided to be happy. Can you watch us instead of arguing? It's about to start. I said it's starting! Tonight's big story is the sensational discovery of the month. It happened in a deep, dark forest. We have found a new species of mammal. It's a cross between an anteater, a platypus, a giraffe, and a hippopotamus. It's very wild, which is why we have so few images to show you. Here. This is all we have for now. And its pawprints, with its long, sharp fingernails. And hairy too. It's been called "the Gr?goire" after a famous French producer, with which it shares certain physical and intellectual characteristics, like for example... The Gr?goire call. Watch out, sparks are going to fly. It'll be the spanking of the century! Before we move on to the rest of the news, here's today's motto - "When you put your hand in a wolf's mouth, "never hit him on the head. "Never, ever, ever!" That was the eight o'clock news with Billie and Valentine! And what's next? A spanking! The Koreans arrive on Monday. 18 of them instead of 8. Not a small crew any more. It's an army! What about your Swedish movie, Venus? Saturn, not Venus. Unfortunately... Stig Janson shoots only when he feels like it. It has its charm, but each shooting day costs me 20,000 euros. Something about this film has always bothered me. Last week a crew member committed suicide on the set. Hanged himself. Hanged? That's awful. Why didn't you tell me? Things like that happen. Val?rie is nagging me to go to Malm?. Our trip to Italy... It's not the best time. Gr?goire, you can't do this to me. We haven't had a family holiday in years. We went skiing last winter. You were always on the phone. If I come, I have to be able to call. No blackmail. Not the same size? I need two more. Is there another one? Yeah, they're both even. Very good. This way instead... Great! So, where is Valentine? She's gone. She's disappeared. How about that! Where can she be? Here she is! Go and get dressed. Gr?goire the mammal will get his revenge. Outside! Girls, this is no ordinary chapel. It's a Templar chapel. What's a Templar? The Templars were soldier monks. Their order was founded to protect the Crusaders in the Holy Land. What's a Crusader? The Crusaders were knights. To go to heaven, they wanted to free the Holy Land. I'm going in. Back then, the Holy Land was occupied by the Muslims. The Crusaders got their way, creating the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Templars took control of the trade between the Middle East and Europe. They grew stronger and stronger and became very rich. So strong that they irritated the State. Can I climb up the ladder? Then a king, Philippe Auguste or Philippe le Bel, I can't remember which, felt threatened by their power. So he seized their coffers, everything the Templars owned was confiscated, and the order was disbanded. Hello, Gr?goire. How are you? - Good, sir. And you? - Fine, thanks. I spoke to the film lab's lawyer. He went through the accounts with a fine-toothed comb, and he says you owe them over a million euros. Plus interest. You realise the next step is to freeze your assets. Obviously, we'll try to prevent them, but we're cornered. Why not sell a few films in the catalogue to get some cash flow? I won't sell the catalogue. And most of it's already been mortgaged off. I can try to buy time, but I don't think they're willing to compromise. Do you understand that? I should have lunch with their new manager. He wants to save the company. He won't cut a deal. What will happen if the bank cuts you off? I don't know. Maybe I'll jump out of a window. Here. Did you talk to the lab? - They blame it on Kodak or the camera. - Who are they kidding? Did the camera wrinkle the negative as well? They're sloppy, that's all. Our films get processed last, in dirty tanks. With what we pay... They should clean it, screen it, then we'll see if it's the negative or not. - Koreans like their hotel? - No complaints. Can they scout locations with your car? If someone gets it from the police, because for the moment... I can't drive. At least, not near cops. What happened? I got pulled over. No more points. Where's your office going to go? - How did you get here? - Bus. It's great. It meant I could read a script. I met an interesting kid. We'll produce him. Without your car we have a real transport problem. Ho-Jung has an assistant, a cameraman, a translator and a set designer with an infant. They can't all go with Antonin. Sweden on the line. I'll put you through. So? Are you holding up? Tough weekend. - Talk to the distributor? - I did. He won't put in another penny. Damn... Do you have any other ideas? None for the moment, but... tomorrow's another day. In the meantime, don't let Stig make them do overtime. Get him drunk... till he passes out. He doesn't need my help for that. Seriously, it's hard enough to pay the crew as it is. If they shoot on a Sunday again... As a matter of fact... they called for a strike if they don't get paid in 48 hours. Really? I'll think it over. We'll talk this afternoon. You said to remind you about your accountant tonight. I always forget him. Families Perchance Hello, this is Gr?goire Canvel. Congratulations! I read your script today on the bus and I think it's excellent! I was bowled over. My catalogue's already in the hands of the bank. And I need a new line of credit for Janson's film. - Let me. - No, I'm paying. - No, I am. - Put your card away. No need to fight! The bank's in it up to its neck. They'll go along. To a certain point. If you go bankrupt, they get nothing. It's a non-question. I won't sell my catalogue. I sold mine. I'm no worse for it. Losing it would mean I did all this for nothing. To end up in the hands of a receiver. What's this movie, Saturn? Why do you produce stuff like that? Stig Janson... Are you a masochist? I like his films. And everyone turned him down. He gets turned down for a reason. He's a psychopath. He's difficult but a great director. Did you see his retrospective? I don't have time to go to the cinema! Give me some titles. The Wound, Conscience, Garden Of Eden. Garden Of Eden is a masterpiece. Never heard of it. What does Sylvia think? Probably that I should change jobs. Don't think that. She admires you a lot. Everyone admires you, but no one helps. I don't need help. We're going to Italy in a couple of weeks. To show the girls Ravenna. Good idea. Let them manage without you. Hey, Kova! You still haven't finished editing? Is it Same Time Tomorrow or When Pigs Fly? Get a distributor and I'll show it to you. I'll sign, but I don't like them much. I shouldn't have gone with them. There wasn't a better offer! Micha?l? It's Gr?goire. I owe the Swedes for three weeks. I'll give them two cheques. They can cash one now, the other in early August. I have too much going on. I need some extra time. Anja will fly to Malm? tomorrow. Give them the cheques once they've agreed to wait. Not before! He doesn't seem in such a bad mood. It's because you're here. She has to stop calling him. Every time they speak he goes crazy. He broke some equipment. He's out of control. Yesterday he went in the farmhouse, took a rifle and aimed it at me. Take away his phone. He just saw Damien. He said to him, "Kill me, kill off my character, so I can leave the shoot." Let him go, if he has no lines. Instead of 12 in the shot have 11. No one will notice. The others will start a revolution! Anything wrong? Don't feel well? Trouble with your wife? Some guy got her pregnant. And she refuses to abort. It's not easy, but try to be strong. This way. It's a shame Cl?mence isn't here. She'd have enjoyed it. We should have forced her, but you didn't want to. Don't run in churches. Stop it! Look. See all those colours? Aren't the sheep amazing? What else do you see? Palm trees... olive trees. - White flowers. - Lilies. There are birds and squirrels. And sheep going up. They're not sheep. They're deer. The sheep represent the faithful. That one on its own is St Peter. There are two on the other side. St John and St James. Who's in the middle? St Apollinaris. He was a bishop. The first in the history of Christianity. Who are the two men on top? Moses... and Eli, they're prophets. See the hand? - Who is it? - The Father. God the Father. Can I have a euro, please? - What for? - To light a light. A candle. I lost my flip-flop. Again? And I saw a toad. A toad and a spider! Do you know where Daddy is? Come back now or I'll go back to the hotel and pack my bags. Sylvia, it's Sweden. They cashed the cheques. It's a disaster. I'm going back. Gr?goire Canvel, for Justin Pasquier at Cin?-Cr?dit. One minute, please. It's reception. There's a Mr Canvel to see you. He's on the fourth floor. Moon Films... Is smoking still allowed? Two people can still smoke here. The bank CEO and you. So, what's going on? We just showed Jackpot to Gaumont. They loved it. They're right. It has potential. Touch wood, but... so far, so good. The Swedish film is way over budget. It's true. The sets cost more than expected. With a demanding director, there's a price. But you wrote a ton of cheques last week. For a huge amount, pal. You couldn't warn me? Listen, Stig Janson is a great artist. He's a genius. He has a vision. You have to trust him. His box-office appeal has yet to be proved. His time has come. He had a retrospective. The papers went wild. Maybe, but his films never made a penny. This one is going to take off. It's not abstract like the others. It's accessible. It's romantic. An epic. A saga. Canal Plus love what they saw. They promised to put some more money in. It's not just the Swedish film. You're already four million in the red. And there's all the stuff I don't know. You have my catalogue as collateral. It's not even worth a million. And I'm being generous. How's it going? Hello, everyone! I spoke to Stig. He can't reach you. Burying your head in the sand is not the answer. Kova's distribution deal has to be signed by Monday. They get everything, nothing for us. We're sinking. No, we're not. We'll manage. It's a matter of time. My banker wasn't very hopeful but he'll do his best. - Someone for you. - Two minutes. Jackpot is going to do well. If we finish it. We've got too many unpaid bills. No sound studio wants us. Even if it works, who cares? We sold all our shares. If the bank says no, I have a last card to play. My family. They have money. I've never borrowed from them. I can. It would be painful. Val?rie, my assistant. I told you about Arthur Malkavian. With me for 15 years. Colette, our secretary. Fr?d?ric, accountant. We've made a lot of movies together. With yours we should reach... 50! Can you put me through to the editing room? I wasn't destined for film either. I come from a family of industrialists. My mother saw me running a company, like my older brothers. She was very disappointed. For her, films are vulgar. Your lawyer says to call It all worked out well. It allowed me to do as I please. Living far from home, not doing what you were intended to, can be lonely, but you answer to no one. You're free. - Knock-knock. - Come in! Hello, Madame. I've come to water your plants. Wait, before you leave... It's dried. I need water to clean my blackboard. Let's pretend this is my exercise book. What's on your mind? Nothing. I'm just thinking. Your hair looks good up. Nice change. Really? It's not too harsh? Pretty earrings. I know. You gave them to me. You bought them in Venice. You're right. They were a good choice. - You don't wear them often. - I do. You're back early. Something wrong? Shooting starts in a week and we still need lots of locations. Relax. It'll work out. At the last minute. She wants someone more professional. Antonin is inexperienced. He only knows students in studios. That's not what we want. - I thought they had Pierre. - He's not free. Bad idea, using a runner. A location scout is not the same price. I'm overworked too. I also work seven days a week until midnight every night. I kill myself here! Anja? - I'm taking a nap. - Shall I watch the door? Please. Can you rewind a little? More, more... Isn't that too dark? I've already made it brighter. Tax department sending bailiffs. Call ASAP. Still no news from the bank? No, I'm not OK. I can't take it any more. I can't go to London tomorrow. Don't worry. Come home! I have that homage at the Cin?math?que. - Which homage? - For S?bastien. I have to speak. I don't know how I can. I can't manage. It's over. What do you mean? It's such a failure. It's a failure financially. Look at all you've accomplished. All the movies you brought to life, all the directors you made famous. Everyone has grievances. That's not true! Besides, it doesn't matter. You won't leave me? I'll never leave you. I love you. I love you so much. What do you want to do? How about going to the cinema to lift our spirits? No! I'd like to walk. 20... 25... 30... 35 pounds! Hurry or you'll be late. Don't worry. It'll be fine. Here's your jacket. Give your mother a kiss. Who's watching us? Who do you think? - Is it you? - Yes, it's me. I'd rather take the train with Mummy. If you like, I'll squeeze you into her bag. It's me. I was thinking... Situate the part in Corr?ze in le Berry instead. Beno?t Trost would like that. He's head of the commission. I swear, it could help. Too obvious? No, I don't think it is. The news isn't good. The bank refused. It was to be expected. As for the tax department, they won't agree to the repayments. They seized the negatives of Jackpot. It's blocked. The accountant told me yesterday. No, he's out. Can he call you back this afternoon? I'll tell him it's urgent. Yes... I understand. I'm going for a walk. Why did he do it? There's no way to have a religious service at the weekend. I know of a pastor who can speak about our brother with a certain... eloquence. You have to think of your mum. And of Cl?mence and Billie. They need you. He didn't think of us, though. He thought about you all the time. I know he adored you. But he was suffering so much, that he forgot you. Why didn't he tell us he was so sad? Maybe he didn't want you to worry. He's not suffering any more. And now... what'll happen to us? Well, you'll... become big girls... Beautiful. And you'll fall in love. And we'll always be here. I'll always be here for you. The Canvel family mourns the death of Gr?goire, son, father, husband... Can I see? Show me. He made a flourish with his arm... and took a book out of his pocket. It was by Benjamin. He showed me a line and I copied it down. "A painting by Klee "depicting an angel... "which seems... "on the verge of straying... "from the place where he stands still..." I'm so sorry. It's fate. Hello, Isabelle. It's Kova Asimov. She can't talk. I'll tell her you called. It's all we have left... Bills. If I hadn't left, he'd be alive. Don't say that. It's true. I shouldn't have gone. I don't think he wanted to die. I think... he did it in a moment of madness. But he bought himself a gun. That was... so he wouldn't feel prisoner. He needed to feel that... he could say yes or no. He was very unhappy. - Need any help? - No, thank you. In my opinion, Sylvia, you should tell us what you want. What are your priorities? Because... you're in charge now. Not that Moon Films can really survive, but... you'll have choices to make. Do you want to fight for the company or would you rather turn the page as soon as possible? I'll fight to the end. I can't replace Gr?goire obviously, but... I'll do all I can to keep the catalogue and finish the films. Fortunately, we're almost done with Bloodshed. Cin?-Cr?dit gave us the green light. But the two other shoots are behind schedule. Saturn can't be made without more financing. For the moment, no one is willing. Given how important it was for Gr?goire, I think we should see it through. He said it was the one film too many. It killed him. You can't say that. If we don't finish Saturn, his death is even more useless. It will get made, Sylvia, but not with Moon Films. In any case, not with me. It won't be easy to find someone to produce it. What about the Korean film? Moon Films can't start a new shoot. I agree. We mustn't forget the scale of Gr?goire's debts. How much exactly? Exactly? No. I don't know the whole story. But we're talking several million euros. First, the lab. He owes them a million. Then the suppliers. A lot of them. And the bank. For Saturn, Cin?-Cr?dit wasn't enough. He took out a large loan with another bank. Plus a personal guarantee for the Korean film. For how much? 700,000 euros. To hold on to the catalogue, we need some leeway. The lab has to wipe the slate clean. Is that possible? Very unlikely, but given the circumstances, we'll try. If the lab cancels part of the debt, if you quickly find investors for Saturn, if Cin?-Cr?dit goes along all the way, and if the administrator is helpful, you have a small chance to finish the films which are under way. And you, Sylvia, may save part of the catalogue. A lot of ifs. That goes there, and then the men go there and then the counters go there. Should I throw this away? Let me see. Let's keep it. We'll keep everything. I'm fed up with this game! Come on, girls. Let's go for a walk. Not right now. To the chapel, like we said. There it is. Want to go? We're going. I cried for three days when my mother died. And I got through it. You'll get through it too. Sooner or later, our mothers leave us at the mercy of our wives. Hurry up! That way. there's no more work, no more money, except for pensioners. The young people go to the city to find work... Thankfully we have the animals and the allotment. And the school hasn't closed yet! - Who financed the Koreans? - Arte. How much in the fourth week? I spoke to Stig about Saturn. The Russians seem interested. His friends, the TV producers? Stig says they'll put up money. He's dreaming. According to Jean-Marc, their lawyer says the same thing. Jean-Marc found him credible. We can't go to Malm?... That's absurd. I have no time. I have my own films. I can go alone. It's absurd. Arthur Malkavian. I see so many people... Sit down. I can't get a lawyer for 9,000 euros! I don't believe it for a second. You didn't sign a contract? Sorry, I can't help. Don't be sorry. That's for S?bastien when he comes! Bye. And good luck. Can you wait in the caf? downstairs? I'll be five minutes. I saw one of your films. - The Dream. - Did you like it? I loved it. I'm touched, but it's not a good film. I disagree. It was beautiful. It's a first film. Very uneven. Lots of flaws. It was a youthful mistake. I think it's perfect. Really? If I could redo it today, I'd change a lot. My films after that are much better. They're more balanced. - See them. - I will. It's self-defeating. That's not why he killed himself. There are other reasons, personal ones. - Apparently he led a double life. - A son he kept hidden. Just a rumour. Last time I saw him, at a preview screening a few days before he died, he ran off saying, "I'm taking French leave." Is it true I have a brother? We crossed paths at Moon Films. Did you like the film? It wasn't bad. The acting was a bit forced, but it's good. I'm back the day after tomorrow. Go to Brigitte's. Don't stay on your own. Darling, please call me. I'll explain everything. Sylvia, darling, I finally decided to go and see my father. I spent an austere weekend with him. It started with a funeral and ended in the rain. Papa is gloomy. He's given up, stopped working. His dog's ill and can barely walk. Papa told me where to bury him - in the garden, under the apple tree. In the evening he says he hears noises in his head, goes to his room and comes down late the next day. I forced him to take a walk. I'm not sure it helped. I brought back some hawthorn blossom. It reminded me how this home is devoid of women. I had a nightmare. We were fleeing a party but couldn't find a place to be alone and make love. Every room we went into disappeared and there we were in harsh light and crowds. Imagine how happy I am to get back to Paris. I can't wait for you to see the office. Old building, dilapidated apartment, but I like it here. I can't afford to redo it anyway. I miss you terribly, but you'll soon be in my arms. That makes me feel confident and strong. Everything seems so powerful, so clear. Gr?goire. Pleased to meet you. Stig. Do you want some water? Yes, please. Right, so... these men represent the Russian TV station Kultura. They confirm, from what I can make of their limited English, that the station will invest a large amount in the film and pay the last three of the five remaining weeks if the shoot is moved to Russia. These people are here to help us. We can't shun a serious offer. You should make a small effort. Do you realise the risks Gr?goire took for you? - Can I speak to you in private? - Of course. Listen... I won't start worshipping your husband because he's dead. I won't lie to you just to be nice. He had... a great many flaws. It was hard to work with him because... he'd run away. But he was... warm and charming... and when he was in front of me, my anger disappeared. He was sincere. I think he was proud to produce my film and would like to have finished it. That's true. Your friend isn't the same. He doesn't like cinema. He just wants to get rid of me and my film. February 22nd, 1989. Gr?goire, I received the cheque. Now here's some news of your son. Moune is happy at school despite trouble in gymnastics. "Coordination problems." He stuck out his tongue at a teacher and he recently bit one of his classmates. I asked him what this behaviour meant but he wouldn't answer. They suggest a child psychiatrist. What do you think? Fondly, Isabelle. No, Moune is not getting any better. I'm distraught. This boy who was so full of life will become a sad man interested only in his sterile eccentricity. He'll become stupid if it continues. Why did I only have boys? If at least they loved mel Thanks for the cheque, surprisingly generous given your problems. I hear you're drowning in debt, almost bankrupt. Isabelle. What you were doing isn't nice. Is it nice to abandon your son? To lie to your family? He didn't abandon him. They were separating. She wanted to keep the child. I'm sad. I'm all alone. Silence all around me. You only care about the films, not me. I'm doing it for Dad. Don't become like him. Moon Films will be over soon. Fortunately. Good riddance. Don't forget how much he loved you. Draw strength from that love. Remember how he was gentle and sensitive. How lucky we were to have him for so long. Think of what was radiant in him. But, Mum, he renounced us! He preferred the void. You know that's not true. I don't need to be consoled. His death doesn't nullify his life. It's one thing among others. How can you say that? That's what he'd say. I'm sure of it. How about that! I recognise you. I was at the funeral. - Come in. - I brought you some letters. This way. Turn it down, guys! Have a seat. Are you looking for Moune? He lives in the country with his wife and baby. Was he at the cemetery? I don't know if you should meet him now. Maybe wait a bit. He wasn't very fond of Gr?goire. And you? Did you hate him? Not at all. Did you see him often? Never. NVR Film Lab... Pleased to meet you. Come in, please. I have great respect for Gr?goire Canvel. We never met. I started here a few weeks ago. But he used the lab for 20 years, which is a long time. A good collaboration. With its stormy moments. Because... he was a character. A charmer. You know that better than I do. Now we're paying the price. And it's very steep. I'd like to help, but what you're asking is impossible. We can try our hardest, but not wipe away half the debt. We have 150 employees here. My main responsibility is to keep this company commercially viable. Believe me, every day is a fight to keep it alive. That's the film I mentioned. And what's your film about? I haven't finished it yet. I keep reworking it. I'm on my eighth version, I think. He fights back. He has a history of violence. - And he kills him. - Why does he kill him? Why? Because... it just happened. He was scared, he was being pursued. - The she finds out about her brother's death. - How does he die? It's a little complicated. He falls from a tree. Sounds like a barrel of laughs! I have to go. Tell me the rest of your story. Hope it ends well. Last Holiday Something to drink? A large coffee. Filter coffee? Not filter coffee. With milk. A caf?-cr?me? Small? Large? Espresso? Hot chocolate. Sorry to make you wait. Follow me, please. Please have a seat. The situation seems clearer. For Saturn, I see no way out. There are no investors. We called on all our contacts. No one's interested. The Russian offer is pure fantasy. I told the director. He's furious. He's suing Moon Films for damages. It's wild, but we can't stop him. That's the worst of it. The other films are less problematic. For Same Time Tomorrow, you have a deal. Obviously you're not in a position to negotiate with the distributor, but there's no alternative. It won't generate much money for you. As for the Brett film, Jackpot, it's still going strong as of last Wednesday. It's the success Gr?goire hoped for. His bet paid off, but your profit margin is small. Unfortunately, none of this can really affect Moon Films' financial situation. We're faced with a huge debt, far beyond what we can handle. Negotiations are under way with the lab, but even if we obtain a substantial reduction, it won't be enough. NVR was bought out. As you know, it's no longer the family business that treated Gr?goire well. The financial officer has never heard of him. Trust me, they don't view the situation kindly. All this is compounded by Saturn's debts, which are enormous. Well, enormous... Everything is relative. Nothing compared to 20 years of accumulated bank debt. And on the other hand? Unfinished films whose profits aren't yours. A good catalogue, but so over-collateralised that it's of no commercial value. In fact the catalogue hasn't been yours in years. I'm sorry, but there seems to me no possible rescue plan. In principle, I see no alternative for the company other than liquidation. Is it going OK? - Want to flip it? - Yes, together! Again? Let it cook a bit first. We're spending Christmas with friends near Bologna. We've been before. Remember? Lemon, plain, or jam? Lemon. Otherwise, I don't rule out returning to Italy one day. You can forget about that right now! I don't know if I want... to going on living here, in this apartment, this city. If you go, it's alone, old dear. Valentine is dead against it. Maybe it's too soon. Of course it's too soon. It's just an idea. But thinking of the future gives me courage. And Billie is less deeply rooted, so maybe... she'll want to move. And Cl?mence? I'm not going to live in Italy. I don't want to be surrounded by Italian women. One at home is enough. Remember, you're half-Italian. But my soul is French. We don't want to be far from Daddy. The lights! What happened? Is it the fuses? I'll check. It's not the fuses! It's the whole street. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. We can't see a thing. It's all black! Let's get the lamps. Candles instead. The lamps won't work. Your candle is big. True. It's quiet. Very. It would be great if the lights stayed out forever. Let's go down and see. - Come on, Mummy! - Blow out the candles. Careful, I'm turning on the light! The keys! The keys... She's hard to understand... Listen to that crazy Italian! Quiet! We can even see the stars. What a shame. It's over. That's life! How long are you staying? Two weeks. What a mess! So? - Can I have this? - What is it? It says "Jackpot trims". - What for? - I don't know. - Valentine, no. - Why not? Someone may need it. Who, the liquidator? Maybe the director. They're trims. They'll be thrown away. OK. Look, cigars. Who's the liquidator? The man who's talking to Serge. What does he do? Take a guess. He liquidates! What's a liquidator? The liquidator is the man who's selling the company, the films, and everything else to pay off Daddy's debts. Moon Films won't exist any more? But Daddy's soul will always live on, through his films. Not just through the films. Through us too. Especially through us! He was lucky. He found a producer. Families Perchance. - How do you know? - I met him... by chance. Not opening them? Later. Come on, let's go. Can I take one of Daddy's cards? Can I take two? - Three? - Come on, let's go. Take them all! Goodbye, Colette. Goodbye, Sergio. Goodbye, Fred. Goodbye, Mr Liquidator. Goodbye, Mr Liquidator! Goodbye, Paris! Don't cry. We said we'd go to the cemetery. Darling... we don't have the time. FATHER OF MY CHILDREN
