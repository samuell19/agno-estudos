No... But... Okay. The thing is... Spit it out! The thing is, despite everything... we will still try to go a bit farther. - That ceiling is completely fucked! - Yes, we all saw the cracks... but we'll cautiously move on a little. Clear the rubble out of the shaft... and let's go a little further. Let's work together now. Together? We're the ones who crawl in there. What the fuck is the old fart doing on that land? Herding his three shitty reindeer on it. - Shut up! - A fucking senile old git! You fucking papa's boy. What? Enough! THE LAST ONES Your stash is blown. Fuck. I won't tell anyone. What's up? Waiting for a ride. Where to? Italy. 1. RUPI AND RIITTA Goddammit! I drove well. You saw that? Ouch! Ouch! Hey! Seriously, you stepped on my toe! Fuck, I have a black nail already! It really hurts! - I love you, I love you. - Seriously, just don't step on my toes! Just a thought... I was thinking... if it's not completely mad... - If something like this... - What? What if... What? Well, fuck, what if we drink champagne! This is champagne, goddammit! No worries! The worries are over! Careful...! Hey, Kari, you are crazy! Well, if you say so... Let's have a little taste... Moilanen, get the fuck out of here! You've been told a hundred times! Get the fuck out of here! Look, the foam is gone, Sanna! Just like I said, it vanishes. So let's have a taste to see if it's total shit or what. This is absolutely fucking tasty. Hey, Kari, Kari... Let's sit down. What is this? Andre Cloucet made it. He makes it at home. Well, you shouldn't put your thumb in there but... What the fuck? Baby... What the hell is this? We did it today! Don't touch it! We just made it today so it's still a little sore... - Do you see what it is? - An anchor? No! It's a key. - It's a key! - A key? For what... What does it open? It opens... Hold on, we'll show you. - When we hug... - I've got a padlock on my back. Riitta, it's so cool, so cool. Yeah, yeah. - Did you see the padlock? - No. This is really, like... No, but, I just wanted to say... This is really nice. I told Lievonen, today you will sing for us. I will. Yes! - I can't wait, really! - Yes, you must sing, baby! - Sing for me. - I will sing to you. So now we'll see... OK. We can't go on digging here. Why don't we go through the bloody north pass? We can't go that way! Bloody hell, there's water coming in! Let's go. Raw celery. Let's say, seven... You eat seven stalks of raw celery when you wake up and in the shower, run ice cold water on your testicles for five minutes, your testosterone will go up. By itself. Natural method. Up, right up. Drink? Put this... ...underneath. Yes, yes. That is the truth. It's worth a try. If you want to spice things up a little. Did you speak to your old man? He's not talking to me. Rupi! Rupi! Show him who's the man of the house, goddammit! You'll save the business! Won't you? If there's no land to mine, then I have no mine! Right? Thank you so much. So dumb. No one here understands. But when I was with Olli, when we were... Olli and I, when we... Fuck! Fucking fuck! That pisses me off! It pisses me off! I can't fulfill your dreams... I'm not some god! That I'm not! I'm just a regular human being, but... I'm in a position where I can open the first door for you! It doesn't give you your dreams, but it paves the way towards your dreams. I'm only human, all I can do is offer you a job. Goddammit, I don't lie about these things. Never. - About work things? - Never! Fuck, this is my company, this is my everything. Do you think I'd clown around about such a thing? No! Fuck, this is no clowning matter! But it's... Everything. You're a beautiful human being. It hurts me to see you like this... like this... No but... Maybe this is your destiny. - What's my destiny? - Being here, like this. No. - Do you believe in destiny? - I believe in destiny. But this is not my destiny. - It's not? - No! Hey! It's been destroyed. Yeah, true. Almost all gone. So, what's up, Rupi? Nothing much. Did you make another 'big bang' today? We'll set ourselves to workways. Why won't you sell? You have no herd anymore. Where did I put the lard for my foot... Dad... So, it's the money you're after? You'll have to wait for that... ...until I'm dead. Because I won't sell. We're here! And everything is fine! Now you're putting words in my mouth. You're saying, like, I think this or that. Not at all! I am just thinking about this job. I see a possibility for development... ...and a possibility to be creative, a more wholesome person. That's all. And these are only just questions. And I feel ready to jump into asking those questions. I think I'll know when the day comes... ...when I don't need to ask those questions anymore. And then I can tell you that now I'm here. Maybe you are! Already there? It's so strange that you go on about it, since I am not. - I think you are. - I am not. What?! What?! Something needs to be done. He needs to be brought out! We can't leave him down there, we need to get him out! How the fuck is this possible? 2. KARI THE FISHERMAN And it's hard for me too... ...to know that something like this could happen. But now, after such an unpleasant day, if one begins to think... ...the first thing that comes to mind is... ...that we were also lucky. Not a single soul was lost. It was close. But we lost no one. At this moment, we've got only one man in the hospital. - That... - Kinnunen. Kinnunen is lying in the hospital. And the news is that he'll be fine. Kinnunen will lie there for a few days. The way we know Kinnunen, he will return a stronger man. But now we need to continue. Because, as Finns, we know... ...these are the moments when Finnish men won't give up. No! We keep going... ...because we want to show them all, goddammit... that we don't give up! Especially here in Lapland! A little of that Lappish spirit that is in us! We can now show... ...that life goes on. Not much more can be dug but... ...we can still dig a little bit more. And we will dig. Yes. I was also thinking that... ...I will host a party next Friday. At my place. A grill party. Everyone is invited, all of you. I hope to see you there, so we can try and lift the mood a little. We'll drink and eat well. And we'll forget about this unfortunate day. And continue towards the better. Or what? - Yeah, yeah. - I'm proud of you, every fella here. I feel great pride standing here in front of such a fine bunch! And it's been a privilege and an honour to get to know you all. That's how it is. Now every fella to the sauna... let's wash the dirt off and keep going. Thank you everyone! Great work today. Quite exemplary work! Kari... We can't blast anymore. There's not a single safe spot where we can advance. - We can go a little. Just a little more. - It's impossible! It's difficult, but it's not impossible. Nothing is impossible. - We'll go on a little bit more. - No, we... Good work today. Thank you for that. Well... Were there any dead? What happened to him? He got lost in the tundra. I found him there. Maybe it would have been better if he'd stayed there. How did you come to be like this? Me? I will put him in a home if he won't sell. He won't survive on his own. What are you doing? - What are you doing here? - I'm building a beer can pyramid. - What? - I'm helping Kari. What? Are you, like, some hostess or... What are you? What is this? I'm a grill madam. Baby, you're a secretary! - Baby. This is weird. - What? - This is weird. - There's nothing weird here. Okay, then! Let's get started. We got the right weather. Luckily we're not in Honolulu. Hey, put this coat on, it's quite windy. Thank you. God save the queen. Okay. So. Everyone gets 3 beers. And 2 sausages. - After that, it's on them. - I'll write that down. So everybody gets their share. Hence the rations. - Do I write it down here? - Yes, do that. Official protocol. - Grill madam, are you ready? - Yes, absolutely. You are in charge, so it won't get completely out of hand. I'm going to... No mosquitos! No, no mosquitos. Two sausages. And... I'll make a sausage page here. - I'll write them here... - In a grilling mood. And Lievonen, of course, can eat and drink what he wants. Well, this is it. Good vibes. - Pretty fair. Really... - What was that? - The others only get 2 sausages... - What's with the kissing? What kissing? That kissing. He kissed you on the hand. Hey, he was just being polite. Don't be like that. He wants the best for us. He says that he might be able to find you a better job as well. He's not a bad person, really. Put the car away and go sit by the fire... ...and enjoy. - Okay, love you. - Yeah, tell me if you need some more. Go on. Just a little. We dig just a little bit more. Just a little bit more. But how would I, so it wouldn't be... If I... Kari, listen... Go on, say it. That's why we're here. Yes. We're like... - It is a discussion. - We're in the same business here. - Yes, that we are. - So it's not... There is no way possible to dig anything anywhere at all. - This is not possible. - Okay, yep. So we must figure out alternatives to keep going. Of course, of course. Yes. But digging is impossible. It's out of the question. - Yes, yes. - So... Just a little bit more. But you have to understand... If you think... - I cannot go and say to these people... - No, you can't. I cannot go and say... This concerns families, this concerns wives, kids, girlfriends... - You cannot! - I cannot tell them... No, you can't! To go and put their lives... These are high stakes... - That's it. - The stakes are really high! - High stakes? - Yes! You know what high stakes are? Are those really high stakes? Yes, they are! There's a guy with a broken skull! The 1940s! A tight spot. When the big bear fell on us. When the big bear came at us from the east. What did we do then? That was a tight spot. A truly difficult moment. - Wasn't it so? - It was, yes. That was a real tough spot. It was for real back then. True. That was for real. - But... - You know. Your own father was there. Tough spot. Those were the tough moments. Let's have some. - Yes, let's have some. - To those men. - To those men, always. - Real men. - Let's drink to them. - To the heroes. What do you say? 300-euro whiskey. Japanese. Yes, yes! - Thank you. Thank you. - Hey, no, isn't it bloody good? I'm more of a Napoleon brandy man myself... This was a good discussion. An important one. Good that we had it. - I'm glad. - Well, yes... I hope that I don't end up in a situation where have to go and tell... No, you will not! - That would be too much. - Yes, nothing like that. Hey, now to sauna! To eat well, drink well! Okay! - Go to the sauna! - Okay, to the barrel. To the barrel business. Sit down. All good? Yeah. Good... How's the arm? Yeah, well... How's your brother? Yes. Nobody will accept him as our father's caretaker. So you're his sole caretaker? - Yes, well... - Let's get the papers in order then? Yes, the only thing is that... - The reindeer need to be moved... - Reindeer? The reindeer are everywhere, they're like bloody mosquitos. Every fucking corner is full of reindeer. How many reindeer can there be, huh? What do you want? Do you want to rise up? Or do you want to ooze down the slope with the rest of them in your own shit? Is that what you want? To go down? - Can you say your name once more? - Just Lilli. - And you took just one cider? - Yes, just one cider. - Have you taken any before? - Well, just one... - One? - Yes. We'll put down one plus one. You can take one more, and come and tell me if... Friends! Friends! Come over here, all of you! Everybody, come over here! Great! Friends! Today we'll have some fun, isn't that right? Good! Let's get things started with a little bang! Greetings from China! Our Chinese friends have sent us this little bang. Let's pop this and see what happens next! Or what! Lasse! Lasse! Okay, that was that. I want to thank you all for everything that you have done. All that fine work that has been done. So here's a modest greeting from France. Champagne. Champa-beer. Sweden's best selling champagne. Let's have a little to get things... A little bubbly... Some bubbly to get things started. Is there any Koskenkorva? Sure, we can find some Kossu. But first we'll have a little... It won't pop. It won't pop. First some Jossu! First Jossu and then Kossu! Okay! So, friends! Come and have some! - Champagne. - Kossu is better! Kossu is better? That is the truth! This here is complete shit. Now we're gonna shoot all this to shit. I'm gonna get the shotgun and we'll shoot it all to shit. Good. Let's get this thing going! Who's gonna help? Moilanen! Let's see it blow up! Fuck! Don't shoot Moilanen! Put them down over there! Fuck. Fucking shit. The barrel's crooked. Complete shit. Alright. Yes, yes. Marbled ham? - Marbled ham? - What? The marbled ham? A five and a half kilo marbled ham, where is it? - There wasn't any... any ham here. - The marbled ham? This is a sausage tray. No, sausages. Don't talk about any fucking sausages now. I'm talking about the marbled ham! There was a 5.5 kilo Parma ham. Where is it? Fuck, I want to offer those men something good! I was responsible for...the list... I wrote down all the sausages... - Where is that ham? - I've written down everything... - These are the beers... - How do you make sense of this? That's the first beer page... This is not... This is just... This here is the sausage page and this is the second page... Then I made a separate cider page... And then I... if there's more than two... ...all the extra ones are here in the brackets or with a plus. Good! Really good! Hey, you know what? What? Let's go to Sweden and get a new ham, huh? Let's go to Sweden to get a new ham. - I can't go now... To Sweden. - What? I can't go to Sweden now. The marbled ham? I can't go right now. You're not coming with me? - You've drank quite a lot. - That is totally irrelevant when it comes to marbled ham. - I can't go now. - Of course not. Not the grill madam. The grill madam can't go anywhere. This is pointless. It's impossible to understand any of this. It looks like it's written by a monkey. Monkey language. I can't speak Monkey! What the fuck are you up to boy? There'll be 200 men with nothing but a dick in their hands. Don't you get it? Anything at all? Maybe we should think... What the fuck are you thinking? Fucking Socrates. Good, good, good, just like that. Oh, fuck. Wait here! - Well, hello! - Hello, hello! SHANGHAI MINING CORPORATION Look at that. A sixteen-year-old scotch? - Wait a moment, I'll be right back. - Sure. Come to Hurula's apartment tonight. We'll talk some more. - Well, yeah... - Let's go to the bar. - I heard you had some problems? - Not at all. You know how it is with these people. I just want to be with you... All the time, you know. There's nothing else. Fuck. I have this feeling... you know... From here we go... I'm feelin' like... we're good... I have the feeling... that now we go, you know. At least a little, like... If we... Yes, yes. There's space here. Everything you could ever need. This is pine by the way. Solid wood. Wait outside. Just splash some paint on the walls and it's ready for you to move in. Rupi. You've got yourself a trip to Norway. To get refreshments for the men. Take Lievonen with you, for company. Can a sinner find forgiveness here? I was quite good looking back then. Or maybe not good looking but better looking at least. And I saw her there... ...on the other side... I saw her across the dance floor, and I was like: Fuck, that is my... That is my woman. Y'know, I had this... like, I believed, y'know... If you don't use what you're given, you'll lose it. I was given something... special. And I felt it, y'know? When I was up on that stage, I had this feeling. Y'know, and I don't have it anymore. I have nothing anymore. I'm standing there. I'm completely empty. And I see people looking, they look at me like... ...fuck, like there's nothing left. Y'know, it was... I remember, I was up there. Fuck, people were looking at me! And they were like, you are special! There's something in you! But, you know... I blew it. I blew it. I let the gift go. I blew it. And now I don't have anything Or I have... Now I have Riitta. If I sit by myself, I don't know who I am. Riitta thinks it's a good idea. So I thought that maybe it is a good idea. Maybe he's trying to help us. I don't know. I have done some pretty good work over there... It could be a good thing. Right? If I get the job... of foreman, for example... ...then I could do some good as well. Like, for you as well, y'know... I could probably... I don't know... Maybe find something better for you as well. He's gonna sell the mine. - What? - To the Chinese. For real? For real? - Are you fucking with me? - Nope. Fuck! This is Riitta. Don't leave a message... ...as you probably have nothing important to say. Oh fuck. Okay, turn the car around. We're going back, turn the car around. What the fuck! Are you listening to me? Turn the car around! - I need the money. - Fuck! I love this! Have some more. Have some more, hey! Now, there's some real lyrics. - What? - Thoughts, thoughts. That's deep. No, this is beautiful! - Feelings. - Yes! These people, they've got to be lovers. They have to be lovers. They were! They were! - They have to be. - They were! - Were they? - Yes! But I don't know if they are anymore, but in the beginning... - No, you can't know that! - Kari, you are strange! They were in the beginning. But it's such a long time ago and I don't know if they still are. It's tough. Really, this is tough. - What? - Love! Love! Love! Fuck! The money. Don't snort it all at once! This is fucked up! This is so fucking fucked up! What the fuck did we get? What do we have back there? - What is in the trunk? - Speed. Speed? Seriously? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I can't take it anymore! I can't fucking take it anymore! Really. This is Riitta's answering machine. Don't leave a message... Stop the car now. You are stopping this fucking car! - Is this Kari's speed? - That's right. - This is Kari's speed? - Yes. Watch this! - Sorry. - Fuck, you're stupid. Fuck, you're so fucking stupid. - Sorry, I blew it. - Sorry? Fuck. What the fuck is this? Is this for us? Hey, what the fuck? Wait. - What is this? - Damn it. Seriously, fuck. Okay then. Are you boys coming from abroad? Move away, please. - Did you find it? - Nothing. Okay. You can go. I will kill him. Fuck, I will kill him! Kolehmainen. What? Nothing? Where are you? Okay. You know the Lappish Dream? - The super, super fine hotel? - Yes. They've got these rental cottages that are really super fine. In every one of them, there's an actual electric sauna. Oh, yeah? And all of them have really large beds. And the cleaner comes every day, changes the sheets. - Yes. - And they make the beds. They have everything you could hope for. There's a pool. - Hey, now I.. - There's a fridge in every room. - I have to... - There's a lot of personnel. And they do those snowmobile safaris. Have you heard of them? They take the foreigners wherever... Like, absolutely wherever you can go on a snowmobile. And then they might even spend the night somewhere outside. And you might see just about all kinds of animals there. - Like foxes for instance. - Yes, yes, yes. They set up bonfires in the evening. And then people just sit there by the fire. And it's so atmospheric. And in the summer, when you can't drive the snowmobile, they do these canoe safaris. Do you know what that is? They take a canoe, one in front, one in the back... There are Swiss and Chinese... Hey, listen, where's my sweater? The blue one. I don't know. So, one in front and the other in the back. And they paddle. Along the river. It's called Adventure Travels. Experience the real Lapland. Where'd I put my fucking sweater? - Did you have a sweater? - Yes I did. The blue one. I didn't notice. Maybe on the couch there? - Kari, Kari? - Yes, yes, yes. I've never been in a canoe. And I was thinking, what if you and me take one together... We'll go, we will. But now.... - I'll pack some food... - Where did I leave my... And we can take your French wine... - Can we turn down the music? - Don't... The next song is unbelievable. We could stay there, overnight... ...we might see some animals. - Really, we might see moose. - Yes. We could see a bear! Seriously, there could be bears out there! And if we don't see a bear, then we can just look at the sky and there... Now I need to fucking find my sweater or I'll freeze out there. - Maybe you didn't have... - I had it. I did have a sweater. I'll freeze out there. We're lying and the Chinese are amazed... The Chinese? ...that they've never seen anything like this and we can be like: Yes, I don't know. And seriously, imagine, if we actually see a bear? A bear? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. This fucking sweater, now! Fuck, sweater, fuck! Now I don't... Fuck... Now... No more. How the fuck can something like that... What the fuck is that smell? What the fuck smells this fucking awful? It almost smells like shit. Did someone take a fucking dump in here? How can it smell like shit in here? Fuck! Damn it! How can you people fucking live like this? Now, fuck... This fucking fuck! Kari! Come down from there, you fuck! Hey, come down from there now, you fuck! That's my sweater. My sweater! Fuck! Oh, this? Is this your fucking sweater, you fuck? This? You fuck! Do you want your sweater? What the fuck are you doing? Come down here, you fuck! What? That's my sweater. Everything is going to hell. Soon, even this fire will tumble down. Impatience. The world is becoming a peculiar place. Should we sing? I think we should a little, to get warm. What? Do you have any booze? Something to drink? Good... Feels like... Feels like there's a hole inside. Like a hole inside. Or it's just... scary. Maybe I'm just scared. I've had some stress... Work has been a little stressful... 3. THE TUNDRA Take your wet clothes off. Hey, take your jacket off. - It's wet. - Yes, I'll take it off. Your face looks really weird. What? Do you know how stupid your face looks? It looks fucking stupid. It looks so... So weird, as if you were a little retarded. Do you think that there's something noble about rubbing my feet? You know it's nothing. It means nothing. Could you pant a little less? Is it possible to make a little less noise with your breathing? Can you fucking be quiet for a while? I don't want to hear that damn panting any more! - Do you want some food? - I don't want your food! You know what you enjoy? Bringing me to some little hut. So you can feel like a fucking hero now that you have a little victim here, you can... This is shit! Hey. - "Hey" what? - You're tired. Good day! How're things here? Aha, winter tires! Good, good. Those are bloody good cars. Japanese. Such mileage on them, but still running. What do you want? A bloody shame about Rupi. I couldn't believe it. He's a good boy. - He is. - Have you heard anything from him? No. I'm a little worried about him. What are you doing here? Maybe I can talk some sense into the chief... You've got no business here. - I'm acting in your best interests. - No, you're not. Calm down. Calm down. The county has set the eviction in motion. We could still make a sensible deal. - Show me! - Here they are. You can see it. It's all right here. - I'm not giving them to you. - Show them! They are my papers, I'm not giving them to you. But these are real papers, damn it! Legal papers! If we make an agreement, you will be okay. But if these go through, you'll have to get the hell out of here. Don't you bloody understand such a simple thing? - I want to talk some sense into... - You're not talking to anyone here! Eviction papers! Don't you get it? - Now! Get out of here! - Goddammit. Let's be sensible. Get the hell away from here! Don't you, fuck... Dammit! - Get the hell away from here! - Calm down. Fuck! Okay. Calm down! Fuck! You fucking monkeys! Goddammit! I'm just gonna show the papers... Enough now, fuck! These are eviction papers! Sign your name or you're out of here! Enough now, you asshole! Now you're out of here! Calm down! Calm down! Fuck, it's impossible to deal with you people! The Chinese will pull such tricks on you! You fucking madman! Fuck! Sayonara! Yeah, well... Yes, yes. Alright, alright... Yes, yes.
