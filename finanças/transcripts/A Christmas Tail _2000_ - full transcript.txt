(Thadeus humming) (gentle music) - [Thadeus] Oh boy, it excites me. - [Tim Voiceover] I was 12 years old the Christmas that changed my life. It doesn't seem like that long ago now, but it's been nearly 10 years. It was the best Christmas I ever had ... and the worst. (gentle music) And it was the one Christmas I remember perfectly, every single event that happened. Because my life was never the same after I met the professor. - Let's see now (hums). Ah. Right on time (chuckles). (gentle music) (upbeat music) (dog barking) - Yeah, hey boy, boy. Hey. (dog barking) (upbeat music) - [Tim Voiceover] More than anything that Christmas, I wanted a dog of my own. (upbeat music) Sometimes I used to play in the park with a dog named Ralph. But he wasn't my dog. Ralph belonged to Owen Slade. - Where is that rotten mutt? - [Tim Voiceover] Slade was a local farmer with a bad attitude and a temper to match. (whistling) - Come on! (gentle music) (dog barking) (gentle music) (dog panting) (gentle music) - [Tim Voiceover] I always thought it was so unfair that a man like Owen Slade could have such a great dog and not even care about it. But, life wasn't fair. I grew up in a small rural farming community. I suppose nobody would think it was anything special. But at 12, it was my whole world. Every day, on my way home after school, I used to stop at Harkins Pet Store and look at the puppies for sale in the window. That Christmas, they had a lot of them. - Hey, buddy. - [Tim Voiceover] Growing up, there were only two things I really hated. Being the smallest kid my age in the eighth grade. (dramatic music) And a bully the size of North Dakota named Keith Carmody. Carmody was as wide as he was tall and had the IQ of a fence post. But as big as Carmody was, he had a friend named Olaf who was even bigger, roughly the size of Norway, which is where he was from. Six foot two, 200 pounds, and in the eighth grade, for the second time. - Look who it is, Oaf. - [Olaf] Tim. - [Tim Voiceover] Olaf pretty much had a one-syllable vocabulary. - What were you looking at Webster, that cute little puppy? - Leave me along, Keith, I'm going home. - Do you know what I think we oughta do? Let's run you up a flagpole and see if anybody salutes. - [Tim Voiceover] Any similarity between Olaf and a human being was purely coincidental. - Come on, guys, quit playing around. I got better things to do than this. I got homework. Got a test tomorrow. - Up, high. - [Tim Voiceover] Like I said, a one-syllable kinda guy. And really strong. (upbeat dramatic music) Carmody and Olaf had run me up the flagpole all over town. Swing sets. Trees. Telephone poles. It didn't matter, whatever was handy. - Hi, Tim. - [Tim Voiceover] But it was so humiliating. - Hi. - What you doing? - Just hanging. - [Haley] Are you okay? - Yeah, I think I'm starting to scare him. - He's a bully. - Yeah, a really big bully. - You shouldn't let him push you around like that. - Yeah, I gotta work out more. - I think you look fine. - [Tim Voiceover] Haley Bennett was the cutest girl in the eighth grade. The love of my life, but she didn't know it. - Hey, could you get something for me to stand on? - [Tim Voiceover] I wished it wasn't always her that found me like this. I worshiped the ground she walked on, but never had the courage to tell her how I felt. At this rate, I probably never would. (gentle music) - Hey, are you getting a dog? - No, a kitten. My dad wouldn't let me have a dog. - Yeah, you musta been talking to my dad. - Yeah. Well I guess I'll see you in school tomorrow? - Yeah, sure. Um, you wanna maybe walk to school tomorrow together? If you aren't doing anything. - Maybe. Call me tonight. - All right. (triumphant music) (gentle music) (birds singing) - [Tim] Hey, Dad. - [Henry] Hey, Sport. - [Tim Voiceover] My life growing up was pretty normal, regular home and family. My mom's name was Mary Webster. - [Tim] Hi, Mom. - Hello, Sweetie Pie. Mm, did you have a good day? - [Tim] Yeah. - Get your homework done? - Yeah, we had to read the Gift of the Magi in school. - [Tim Voiceover] She worked at a local department store trying to make ends meet. - It's about people who make wishes and they go wrong. - [Tim Voiceover] She was the greatest mom in the world. - Have you ever read it? - That's nice, Honey. Listen, you need to go get cleaned up for dinner, okay? - [Tim Voiceover] I was at that age where your mom doesn't really listen to everything you tell her. - You know, Mom, it's by O Henry. - Oh, Henry, he's in the office. He's been working really hard all day on the deadline for that greeting card company. Go, scoot. I want you cleaned up for dinner. Hey. Don't call your father Henry. - [Tim Voiceover] My dad, Henry Webster, was a writer. - [Henry] Always remember. - [Tim Voiceover] Not of novels or short stories or anything like that. My dad wrote greeting cards. Writing those simple lines took all of his concentration. - [Mary] Whoa, whoa, whoa (crashing). - Will you keep it down out there? How am I supposed to concentrate? Oh, our hearts are filled with love and caring for you and yours (chuckles), it's perfect. It's beautiful. - [Tim Voiceover] Like I said, it was a pretty normal house to grow up in. - Here you go. I think that's everything. So, Honey, how's it going? - Well I should make enough on these to have some sort of Christmas. I think. - We're not getting a Christmas bonus. - No bonus? None, nothing? - All of the above. - Old Man Costello keeping it all to himself? - Look, I was lucky not to get laid off. He pink-slipped two people in shipping and receiving yesterday. Luckily nobody from sales so far. - So far. - I know what I want for Christmas, and it's real cheap. - Tim. Don't start again. - Not that dog thing again. How many times do I have to tell you we're not getting a dog before you figure it out? Another mouth to feed, they need shots, constant attention, every morning, every night. Your mother doesn't have time to take care of a dog. - I'll pay for it myself. I'll get a paper route or something. And that'll pay for his food. - They chew on stuff, they ruin the carpet, you gonna replace that stuff? And who's gonna pay for this dog in the first place? - We'll get one at the pound. They're free. - Oh no they're not. Nothing is free, young man. We'll be lucky if we have enough money to pay the bills. Hey, I'm all for you getting a paper route. I had one when I was your age, and you can be sure I didn't waste the money on a dog. - But, Dad. - And what about that hamster that you had to have? Remember him? I don't remember whether he died of neglect or committed suicide. - Hamster didn't die, Henry. The hamster ran away. It was the fish who died. - Oh, the fish, yes. The wonderful goldfish. The wonderful goldfish who had to live in the wonderfully expensive aquarium and eat the wonderfully expensive sea kelp stuff. You had him three weeks, then he went belly up, bloop. - They were boring. All they did was swim around. - That's what fish do. They swim. - I can't help it that they died. - Well neither could they because you never fed them. I don't want a dead dog on my conscience. Besides, you can't flush a dog. It's called being responsible, Tim, and you aren't. You should try being an animal sometime. See things a whole lot differently. - But, Dad, you know I want-- - End of discussion, young man. Thank you very much, Sweetheart, it was very good, but I have to go finish this card. (sighing) Tim, I'm sorry, but no dog and that's final. You understand? - Yeah. - What are you working on? - Oh, it's this blasted all-occasion line. I can't wait to get out of it. Oh, now Mother's Day ... that's where the money is. - Oh, Tim. Your dad's right about the responsibility part, you know. (gentle music) - [Tim Voiceover] That was the story of my existence. My parents, the bullies, life in general had hung me out to dry. The girl I wanted to impress thought I was a doofus and generally I figured I wasn't gonna get anything I wanted for Christmas. That day on the tracks, I heard a voice that was going to change my life. - It is coming again, my unbelieving friends. In this hemisphere. After 1,000 years, tonight marks the last few days that this heavenly body will be visible. As foretold by the ancients. Galileo himself rediscovered it in the constellation Rigel during the 12th century. Mathematically, of course. Since the star appears only once every thousand years, there was no way to see it. When it does appear, it appears during the winter solstice, making it very difficult to prognosticate. - I got prognocated by a doctor once. Hated it. (group laughing) But, I ain't never seen nothing like that ever. - Of course you haven't. Huh, my undereducated flotsam and jetsam. - You mean like, the Christmas Star? - Absolutely correct, young man. (train horn blaring) And who might you be? - Tim Webster. - Well welcome, Tim Webster. - You got any food, kid? - Allow me to introduce Clotfelter, one of my traveling associates. - Clotfelter? Is that your name? - Yeah, it's my name. What'd you think it was? - Well nothing. I mean, well, I thought it was your name. - Enough of the introductions now. Tonight, I'm going to demonstrate one of the marvels of the heavens. Right there. Due east. You'll see for yourselves. Yeah, your other east. In the constellation of Rigel is where you will find it, the beautiful Christmas Star. Oh, what a magnificent constellation it is too. Not one of your pedestrian little blue stocks, mind you. With all the majesty of a millennial supernova. Truly a heavenly body. Ah, and a magical one. - How do you mean magical? - Oh, are you interested in the mysteries of the heavens? - Well sort of, I guess. - Good. Then you know about the star then? - Not really. I heard that the Star of Bethlehem was really a comet. - Ah, very astute, you do know a lot. Wasn't a comet, though. It was a Class M star. Oh, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Thadeus A. Widstone, late of Cambridge University and points north, a world traveler, raconteur, bon vivant. Currently traveling in the company of these ladies and gentlemen of the road. All in eager pursuit of life's meaning. And it pleases them to call me Professor. How about you, Tim? What is that you want from life? - Me? I just want a dog for Christmas. - No problem, Sonny. We're fixing to have one for supper (laughs). (group laughing) - Pay him no heed, Tim. Weak minds find it necessary to make strong statements from time to time. But you know, a dog is a lot of responsibility. You're not leaving? - Well, uh. I have homework. - Don't you want to see the legendary star? - I can't really, I have to go. - I tell you what. Why not come back after you're finished? I just might have an idea for you on getting that dog you want. - Well, maybe after supper. - Yes, after supper. It's a special night. Magical really. Tim? If you have any tasty morsels left over after your repast, why not bring them back here? - What? - Food, my friend. For me and my friends. Caring for your neighbors and all that. What do you say? - Mm, okay, if I can. - Ah, mm-hmm. (gentle music) - [Tim Voiceover] I remember thinking how much I wished that what the professor had said about the magic and the Christmas Star was true. - [Henry] Go, go, go, go. - Mom, have you ever heard of the Christmas Star? - Uh, movies or television. - No, a real star, in the sky. It's supposed to be magical. - Hm, well the only magic I need right now is right here in this bank balance. - It's coming again. - What is, Honey, the star? - Yeah, the Christmas Star. Passes by the Earth every thousand years. The same one that was over Bethlehem. It's supposed to happen tonight. It's supposed to be magical. - That's nice. Everybody could use a little magic this time of year. (keys striking) - You know, Mom? The puppy is still there at the window in Harkins. - Oh, I get it. That's what this is all about, huh? Oh, Sweetie, you know the answer to that. - Come on, Mom, he's real little. He won't eat much. - Now. In six months, he's gonna be Godzilla with an appetite. - Yeah, but what about Christmas? - Oh, Honey, there's gonna be other Christmases. - I don't want other Christmases. I want this Christmas! How come you guys are doing this to me? - Hey, freeze. (paper rattling) (Henry groaning) First of all, you do not ever raise your voice to me like that, young man, do you understand? And second, you have been given everything you ever wanted. Everything. And the problem is, you don't take care of anything, especially living things. You need to learn to think about others. You have an awful lot to be thankful for, Tim. After dinner, you're going straight to bed. Lights out. Go on, go to your room. (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] That night in my room, I couldn't stop thinking about what the professor had said. - Starlight, star bright. - [Tim Voiceover] It was like, if I really believed hard enough, it would be true. (soft dramatic music) I decided I had to find out. (soft music) Even it meant taking a chance on being grounded by breaking my curfew. (soft music) - Very soon. Very soon now. - Don't look no different than it ever looks, Professor. - Oh, that's because you're looking at the heavens with an unbelieving eye. Wait, you'll see. Oh, here comes our young friend, and bearing royal rituals, I believe. Oh, excellent. Savory stew. Well done, lad, well done. - So, are you a real professor? - Well, if it pleases them to refer to me as one who imparts knowledge, who am I to argue? It's not what you know that's really important. It's what you believe. - I believe you. - Ah, well there, you see? It's what's in your heart that counts. And the heart of a young boy is full of magic. - So what happens when you see this star? - You don't know? - You gets a wish. Ain't that right, Professor? - Quite right. - A wish, huh? - A wish, and it's a very special wish. Only comes along once in a thousand years. When the glow of that heavenly body begins to expand, you must make your wish. It only appears a few consecutive nights, and then, pfft, it's gone for a thousand years. But you must have a pure heart for your wish to come true. Which probably means there won't be a lot of wishes granted from this group. - So you just ... wish? - Just wish. Of course, you know, there is a caveat to making your wish. - A what? - A caveat, a condition. That old saying is quite correct. Be careful what you wish for, because that is exactly what you'll get. Exactly. The advent of this star in this millennium will end Christmas Eve, midnight. (soft music) Oh, and one other thing. You only get one wish, and you can't change it. - Ever? - Ever. Hm. Ah, I think it's about time now. Come on. (soft music) Watch right there on the horizon. Go ahead, Tim, quickly, make your wish. - What if it doesn't come true? - But what if it does? Go on. - Okay. (soft music) I wanna ... bee! - Oh, actually it was a yellow jacket. Odd for this time of year. Go on, go on. - A dog. (soft music) I wanna dog. Professor. Nothing happened. - Are you all right, Tim? - Yeah, I'm fine. Little tired, but, yeah. I better be going. - Ah, boy's right. Best of luck. - Yes, thanks. - Please thank your mother for that excellent stew, Tim. - Yeah, sure. (soft music) - Yeah, right. Dreams, wishes ... they don't come true. (mysterious music) - [Tim Voiceover] What was that? My mom's stew? I told myself, don't panic. Don't panic. - Whoa. - [Tim Voiceover] Ow. Oh, I wasn't okay. I was sick, really sick. (Tim moaning) (mysterious music) - You all right, boy? Don't look so good. - [Tim Voiceover] Who was this walrus in the sheriff's uniform? Where was I? (upbeat music) What time was it? I had to get home. What was I doing on the playground? (upbeat music) Ugh, Mom was gonna kill me. And then Dad would have to write her a sympathy card. Then I noticed I was going really fast. And low. (upbeat music) Then something caught my eye. (soft dramatic music) Oh no, oh no. I was a dog. It wasn't a dream. I was a dog. I had dog legs, dog ears, dog tail. Well, at least I was a boy dog. Oh, what was I saying? I was a dog. What was I gonna do? I tried to remember what happened the night before. I realized it must have been my wish. - Be careful what you wish for, because that is exactly what you'll get. - [Tim Voiceover] I said I wanna dog. Wait. - I wanna. - [Tim Voiceover] Wait, I said the word bee. - Bee! - [Tim Voiceover] Oh no, I said I wanna be a dog. Aw, the only kid in the universe who'd turn himself into a dog. I had to figure this out. (upbeat music) How could things get worse? Then I saw Carmody and Olaf. (dramatic music) - Look at that stupid mutt over there. He's wearing a scarf. - Dog. - [Tim Voiceover] Great, just what I needed, the village idiot and the Norwegian with his own ZIP code. - Quarter says I can hit him. - [Tim Voiceover] I wasn't worried. Carmody couldn't hit sand if he fell off a camel. (metal dinging) - Ow. - [Tim Voiceover] Time to go. As I ran off, it occurred to me that Olaf wouldn't ever get out of the eighth grade if Carmody kept doing that. - Sorry. (light music) - [Tim Voiceover] I didn't know what to do, but I had to do something. Then I saw her. The one person who'd always helped me before, Haley. - Hey. - [Tim Voiceover] Haley, hi, it's me, Tim, your friend? - Hey, what's your name? - [Tim Voiceover] Tim, my name's Tim. Remember? (dog barking) But all I could do was bark. - Are you lost, boy? - No, I just turned into a dog. Coulda happened to anybody. (dog barking) - Who do you belong to, boy? - [Tim Voiceover] Easy, my parents. Then it hit me. Oh no, Mom and Dad. I had to get home. - [Haley] What about your scarf? - Tim, come on, Tim. Time to get up, rise and shine. Gonna be late for school, Tim. Tim? Tim? - [Henry] Problem? - Tim's not in his room. - Oh, well. Probably just went to school before we were up. - That's not like him. - [Tim Voiceover] Now was my chance. - I bet he's still upset about last night. - Hmm. - We had an argument about the dog thing again. - Well, don't worry, Honey, it'll pass. - [Tim Voiceover] Aw, geez, I forgot, no fingers. - Like all things, this time of grief too shall disappear, like the dark at dawning. I like that. Gotta write that down (chuckles). - No, you know what, that's just not like him. He never goes to school early, not for anything. - [Tim Voiceover] That'd work. - I practically have to use dynamite to get him outta bed in the morning. - [Tim Voiceover] All clear. (light music) - Honey, you worry too much. You know, he can take care of himself better than you think. - I'm his mother, it's my job to worry. (dog whining) (water running) You know, I think I'm gonna go over to the school and see if I can't straighten this out. (water running) Henry? Henry! Henry, look, look. - What, what, what? Ew, it's freezing in here. You left the window open, Sweetie. - Henry, forget that, look at this. He's run away. - No, he hasn't run away. He said, I left early, I'll be back soon. What's the big deal? You think he was kidnapped by gypsies and forced to work in the carnivals? - Henry, this is serious. (water running) - I know. How about I go call the school? (water running) (upbeat light music) - [Tim Voiceover] So, there I was. A dog, alone, and starved. I had to find the professor, but I had to get something to eat first. (upbeat light music) But who was gonna give a stray dog any food? I knew I was gonna have to be sneaky about this. (upbeat light music) It's never too early for good Chinese. There's my chance. Just slip in ... and. (man speaking foreign language) Oh, whoops. Mr. Fong wasn't as friendly as I remember. (upbeat light music) Well, if you can't go in the front, check out the back. (upbeat light music) This dog thing was something else. I could smell everything. It was amazing. Hmm? A little cold, but not bad. Actually, it was pretty good. Oh, what was he doing? I didn't mind him eating with me as long as he left me some. (upbeat light music) Whoa, hey, pal, whatever happened to shaking hands? I could see this dog thing was gonna take some getting used to. - [Man] Get outta here, you mutts. - [Tim Voiceover] Time to beat feet. I realized that I couldn't hang around town because I'd end up a dog forever. (upbeat light music) My only hope was to find the professor again. See if he could change me back. (soft music) But when I got there, he was gone. (soft music) Oh boy, it was that toothless Poindexter from the night before, Clotfelter. - Hey, boy. What you doing here? - [Tim Voiceover] I wasn't selling Girl Scout cookies. Where's the professor? - Good doggy. Come here, boy, come here. Hello, puppy. What you doing here? You look like you been deserted. You hungry, boy? - [Tim Voiceover] Food? Okay, what do you got? - What do you say, partner? - [Tim Voiceover] Little sausages, huh? Mm. Mm. Say, these are pretty good. - You like those, do you, huh? Mm. (burping) Me too. Hey, you wanna be my dog, boy, hm? - [Tim Voiceover] No, I just wanna find the professor. How could I make this wingnut understand? (light music) Okay, Einstein, watch. I'm gonna draw you a picture. First, a circle, and these are the eyes. And a bow tie. (light music) - [Clotfelter] Hey, how did you do that? - [Tim Voiceover] How do you think? You just watched me. If you were any slower, you'd be in reverse. - That looks like the professor. You're one smart mutt. I could make a fortune with you. - [Tim Voiceover] Not a good idea. Just tell me where the professor is. - Good doggy. You wanna stay here with me, don't you? - [Tim Voiceover] No way. - Geez, wish the professor was here. He'd know what to do. Hitches up to West Valley, just when you need him. - [Tim Voiceover] West Valley? Sure, I knew where that was. All I needed is a way to get there. Maybe I could hitch a ride or something. - Come here, boy. Come on, boy. - [Tim Voiceover] Time to get going. - [Clotfelter] Rotten mutt. - [Tim Voiceover] So long, fuzz brain. (light music) I was cold, I was wet, I was a dog. I wasn't used to all this walking. Then, I heard him. (dog barking) It was Ralph, my old buddy. Gee, it was great to see him. So this was Slade's farm? I figured I'd check it out. (light music) (chickens clucking) (cow mooing) What was in here? (chickens clucking) (chickens clucking) Geez, I had no idea chickens were so nervous around dogs. (dog barking) Uh-oh, Slade. - Finally got you, you chicken-stealing son of a- (gun firing) - [Tim Voiceover] He's crazy. - You ain't getting away this time. (gun firing) (Owen growling) (gun firing) - [Tim Voiceover] Fortunately, I was too far out of range for him. There's some bad people in this world, but for sheer meanness, you'd have to put Owen Slade's name at the top of the list. I could see this wasn't going to be easy. What I needed was a ride. (soft music) - I understand. We appreciate everything you're doing. Thanks. They said it's gotta be 24 hours before they can consider him missing. (sniffing) (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] I wish I could figure out a way to get someone to stop. You never miss your thumbs until you haven't got any. Then, I saw it. I wonder which way he was headed. Hard to say. - I'm first. - I'm second. - Are we there yet? - Does this look like the West Valley Ice Arena? - [Tim Voiceover] Bingo, I was in luck. This guy was a lifesaver. - Don't take too much time in the bathroom. We gotta hurry. - Quit pushing. - I wasn't. - [Tim Voiceover] It was now or never. (light music) All I had to do was stay outta sight for a while. - That bathroom was disgusting. (giggling) - [Harold] Hold it. - [Girls] Oh. - Gotta count heads. - Mr. Gonzales, we have more than heads. - Don't got time for more than heads. I'll assume the bodies are attached. Get on. One, two, three, four. Five, six. Hold it. We're missing the smallest member of our group, campers. Where is she? (laughing) You've been following me again, haven't you? Get aboard, Sailor. (giggling) (traffic passing) All right, sit down, hold on and buckle up. Now if we're gonna make it to the ice arena on time, we gotta fly. And it's gonna be a bumpy ride. (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] Nobody knew I was in there but her, and she didn't say a word. What a pal. (soft music) - I can't believe we're finally here. - Hold it. Come on, line up. - Hurry. - Hurry up. - This way, in line. In line, one, two, three, four, five, six. (girls murmuring) Six is not the right number. Where's Emily? All right, everybody, you're glued to the pavement. (girls groaning) Understand? Don't move an inch. - [Girl] We're always glued to the pavement. (light music) - Come on, Princess, get off the throne. Everybody's waiting for you. - [Tim Voiceover] Geez, couldn't this guy give me a break? - Emily? If you don't answer, I'm coming in. - [Tim Voiceover] What do you have to do to get some privacy around here? (mysterious music) - I heard that. - [Tim Voiceover] Oh boy, trapped in the bathroom by this coconut. - Emily? (giggling) Weren't you, just? Come on. Let's go. - [Tim Voiceover] Holy Hawkeye, that was close. - [Girl] Finally, I'll race you to the door. - [Girl] You run too fast. - [Tim Voiceover] Woo, musta been those sausages. (light music) Now I had to find a way to let my folks know I was okay. I guess I'd have to leave another note. I was getting this mouth writing down to a science. (light music) Hoped they could read it with slobber all over the words. (light music) At this rate, it was looking more and more like I wasn't gonna find the professor in time. But I had to try. (soft music) - All right, you know the routine. - [Girl] That was fun. - Buckle up. Keep your arms and legs in the ride at all times. Who wrote the note? Looks like your handwriting, Emily, except you can't write. Who's Tim? Forget it. (engine starting) (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] I had been walking all day. I was tired and a long way from home. I needed to find someplace warm to sleep. And then I saw a little house near the mountains. It was the only house for miles, so it wasn't like I had a lotta choices. (soft music) (cat meowing) (soft music) (cat meowing) I heard something as I got closer. Gee, a kitten. Poor little guy, looked like he didn't have a friend in the world. I was gonna try and help him, but there wasn't anything I could do. (cat meowing) (soft music) I decided I'd let whoever lived there know I was in the neighborhood. (dog barking) When she opened the door, I put on my best hungry face. - Shoot. You smell (chuckles). - [Tim Voiceover] Yeah well, stepped in a few things on the way. - Who are you? - [Tim Voiceover] You'd never believe me if I told you. - Uncle John (laughs). Is that you? - [Tim Voiceover] Do I look like a John? Okay, I'll play along. (dog barking) (laughing) - You always did smell funny. - [Tim Voiceover] Nobody's perfect. Wonder if she had any food. - I figured it was you. You hungry? - [Tim Voiceover] Are you kidding? (dog barking) I'd eat dirt if she put gravy on it. (dog barking) - Well, come on in. - [Tim Voiceover] She was a mind reader. - It's getting cold out here. Don't want you catching your death. Again. (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] Musta been lonely there by herself. I felt sorry for her. (soft music) - It's your favorite (chuckles). Dig in. Ah. - [Tim Voiceover] Boy, this stuff was pretty good. (soft music) - It's been a while since Aunt Martha ran off. She's a black cat now. - [Tim Voiceover] Really? - But you probably knew that already, huh? (chuckling) - [Tim Voiceover] Ha, if you say so. - Oh, since that UFO landed, I've been so busy with family arrivals. - [Tim Voiceover] I was in the Twilight Zone. - Harriet showed up last month. She's a goat (laughs). Well, actually, she doesn't look all that different. - [Tim Voiceover] No, she really doesn't. (sighing) - You stay here with me, Uncle John. Now I insist. We could both use the company. - [Tim Voiceover] I wish I could tell her I was only staying for the night. - Where have you been? You don't smell too good. - [Tim Voiceover] Sorry, they don't make Old Spice for dogs. - When I come back, I wanna be a cat like Grandma. Cats are my favorite. No offense. Wish I could talk dog. We could have a real conversation. It's been a while since anybody showed up who could actually speak. You understand every word, don't you? - [Tim Voiceover] Actually, I do. I just can't say them anymore. (dog barking) - I knew it (laughs). Would you like to read the newspaper? I got that over here, come on. Come on. (soft music) (bird whistling) (soft music) Oh. Probably not. Why would you be interested in kidnappings and such? (sighing) - [Tim Voiceover] I wasn't. What I was was dog tired. - Just like you. Never could stay awake past nine. (laughing) - [Tim Voiceover] She had that right. I had walked too far and been through too much. All I wanted to do was sleep. She mighta been a little crazy, but she had a heart as big as Christmas itself. And I loved her for it. ♪ Oh my darling, oh my darling ♪ ♪ Oh my darling, Uncle John ♪ - You stay here.

What am I gonna do? ♪ Oh my darling, Uncle John ♪ Aw, man, she's gone. Wait, she left the bedroom window open. Alley oop. And I'm a free dog again, yes. But I felt like such a rat. She needed a friend, and I was leaving her alone. Then, I remembered, perfect. It was time for one of Annabelle's cousins to visit. Come out, little guy. You're coming with me. I got a new home for you. By the way, tell her you're Cousin Cliff from Albuquerque. Don't leave any doodles on the carpet, okay? And tell her you believe in UFOs. She likes that. Remember, you're Cousin Cliff from Albuquerque. I gotta go. Be good to her, Squirt. I realized that I had no idea where the professor was. I couldn't find him in a million years. I was a dog. A dog who just wanted to go home. And the quickest way home was over the mountains.

I could smell everything. It was great. Like a book without all the reading. (light music) Hm, what was that smell? Oh, geez Louise, a skunk. A really fat skunk. (light music) Check this out. Whoa, don't point that thing at me. When in doubt, don't, that's my motto. Now I really smelled bad. Just my like, charged by a mad, pudgy skunk. Time to move on. (light music) I musta walked for miles when I first noticed something was different. It wasn't like anything I'd ever smelled before. Then I saw them ... timber wolves. They looked kinda hungry. (light music) Then they were checking me out like I was something off the breakfast menu. Maybe they were friendly. (wolf growling) And maybe they weren't. That's it, I'm history. (upbeat music) (wolves panting) (upbeat music) (wolf howling) (upbeat music) These guys weren't giving up, ugh. (wolves growling) (upbeat music) Oh, I was getting tired. But if I stopped I'd end up as so much wolf sushi. Better get outta here, tubby. (upbeat music) I had to find someplace to hide. I couldn't keep this up. I knew I had to get up above them, where they wouldn't see me. Yeah, this'll work. I'm just hanging out here on this ledge. Hm, I don't see them. Maybe I lost them. Yeah, maybe I did. Catch my breath a minute. Okay, time to get outta here. (dog panting) (light music) (gentle music) (birds calling) (gentle music) (wolf howling) (gentle music) I'd left them like a dirty shirt. I was starting to catch my breath when I walked right into him. He'd gotten ahead of me somehow. And boy was he mad. (wolf growling) Dog gone it. He was gonna eat my lunch. And then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it was Ralph. (dog barking) I couldn't believe it. He was all over that wolf like a cheap suit. (dog barking) He was great. Ha, what a dog. Wow, Ralphie, you're my hero. (upbeat music) You and me, pal, we'll stick together. I don't know how he got there, but I was never so glad to see another dog in my life. (upbeat music) Me and Ralph, heading through the mountains, going home. For the first time, I felt like I was going to make it back. (dogs barking) (clock bell ringing) (gentle music) - Ah. (whistling) Where's that dog? He thinks he's had a beating before. (gentle music) - [Tim Voiceover] I knew something was wrong. The world's biggest bear. (dog barking) And I couldn't move. I just barked at Ralph. (dog barking) But Ralph was brave, braver than me. He attacked the bear. I couldn't believe it. (dog barking) (bear growling) (dog barking) Then it hit me. He was fighting the bear to save me. No! I had to stand up for once. Suddenly, I felt different. I wasn't afraid. (bear growling) For the first time in my life, I wasn't afraid. I'm coming, Ralphie, hang on! (bear growling) (dog whining) The bear had hurt him bad. I didn't care anymore. I wasn't gonna let him kill Ralph. That bear wanted trouble, I was gonna give it to him. (dog barking) (bear growling) (dog barking) (bear growling) Oh, Ralph was hurt bad. I could tell. I stood over him, between my friend and that grizzly. Hey, it worked. He had enough. He was leaving. And don't come back, you furball. (dog whining) Oh no. Ralph was just lying there, bleeding. He wasn't breathing. He had sacrificed himself. For me. (dog whining) It was the worst moment of my life. (dog yelping) (dog yelping) (soft music) I stayed with him until it was almost dark. I'd lost the best friend I ever had. (dog yelping) I finally left him there because there wasn't anything I could do. (gentle music) That night, I spent the most miserable night of my life. If I could, I would have cried. But, dogs can't cry. (gentle music) The next day, I traveled for hours in the snow, heading through the mountains. I kept thinking about what had happened, about the sacrifice that Ralph had made for me. That one event had changed the way I thought about everything. I didn't care as much about what I wanted anymore. Only those who were important to me. I just wanted to get home. (gentle music) (dog panting) Bear Hollow Spring Campground. Maybe somebody was there. Yeah, right. December, perfect time for people to have a picnic, in the snow. I had lost Ralph, and now I was losing my mind. - Dad, look, a dog. - [Tim Voiceover] When I saw them, I nearly fell over. It was Haley, the woman of my dreams. - I think I know this dog. This is his scarf. - [Tim Voiceover] Haley, it's me, Tim. - Ew, what is that smell? - [Tim Voiceover] It's not my fault. A fat skunk did this to me. - Dad, please, we can't just leave him here. We have to take him with us, please. We can't leave him right here. - [Tim Voiceover] I could have kissed her. - Okay. - Come on, boy, come on. - [Tim Voiceover] Terrific, I was going home? (upbeat music) No more walking in the snow. No more wolves or bears. I was going home, to my house and the people who loved me. After all that had happened, it was like a dream. (gentle music) (dog barking) At least I was back in town. Good old, Haley. - You remind me of somebody. I just don't know who. - [Tim Voiceover] And at the rate I was going, she probably never would. - Come on. Come on. You can stay here tonight, boy. I'll get you something to eat. - [Tim Voiceover] Good, I'm hungry. What do you got? The next morning, I got Haley to follow me and look for the professor. Of course, she didn't know what I was doing, but she was a good sport and came anyway. The only place I could think to go was back to where I had first met him. Somehow, I figured, if he was around, that's where he'd be. (gentle music) (humming) (dog barking) Great, he was there. - What are you looking for? - [Tim Voiceover] I couldn't believe it. I thought I'd never see him again. - You are a friendly one, aren't you, eh? - [Tim Voiceover] It's me, Professor, the kid who brought you food and listened to your story and turned into a dog. - Oh, your dog? - No, I thought he might be yours. - What? - [Tim Voiceover] Come on, Professor. It's me, Tim. Don't you know me? - He's not your ordinary dog, is he? - No, it's almost like he can understand you sometimes. - Perhaps he does. - What? - Perhaps he does. Oh, I'm Thadeus Widstone. Everyone calls me Professor. - I'm Haley Bennett. Nice to meet you, Professor? - Exactly, huh? (dog barking) What is it you want, eh? What are you trying to tell us? - [Tim Voiceover] The scarf, I was wearing it. - What? Where did you get this? - Oh, it's his. He had it around his neck. Just like a friend of mine's, but he was kidnapped. - Kidnapped? - Well that's what everybody thinks, but he disappeared anyways. - Ah. Really? - [Tim Voiceover] Yeah, you gotta remember. - You know, he does look familiar. Uh, what was your friend's name? - [Haley] Tim. - Is that you, Tim? - [Tim Voiceover] Yeah, it's me. (dog barking) - This is too weird. - You were the boy that wished for a dog. (dog barking) - [Tim Voiceover] Now you got it. - Oh, good heavens. It worked. Tim? You weren't kidnapped. - Professor, that's a dog, not Tim. - Do you know what this means? - That you need your medication? - Right. No. Something more profound. The Christmas Star legend is true. I suppose you want to know if you can be changed back. - [Tim Voiceover] Bingo. Come on, tell me, I'll do anything. - I'm afraid not. Remember what I told you? According to the legend, you can't change your wish, ever. - [Tim Voiceover] Ever? Oh man, I'm gonna be eating dog food for the rest of my life. - Never did think that was going to come true anyway. Oh, well. Wait. You know there jsut may be something. (dog barking) - Been looking for you, Professor. You was the last one anybody seen with that missing boy. You're under arrest. (soft music) You okay? - Yeah, is he a criminal? - Not exactly, just wanted for questioning. - Look, I don't know what's going on, but the dog has something to do with it. - I don't see how. Do you always talk to dogs, Professor? - I assure you, sir, that I had nothing to do with any kidnapping. The truth is, the boy wasn't kidnapped. He simply changed into that dog. - You gotta stop drinking the homemade stuff, you know what I mean, Professor? Let's go. (light music) - Don't worry, I'll take care of you. - [Tim Voiceover] Yeah, but I don't wanna be a dog when you do it. (light music) - Look, I'm not likely to overpower the likes of you. Couldn't we dispense with these handcuffs? At least for the ride, they're so uncomfortable. - All right. - That's a good fellow. (light music) - Watch your head. - Where are you going? - Is this absolutely necessary? I guess it is. - Hey. - [Tim Voiceover] I need to talk to the professor, without you. First the window. And lock the doors. (dog barking) Professor. - That is you, isn't it, Tim? - [Tim Voiceover] In the fur. - All right, there may be a way. We'll get someone to do the same thing that you did. Make a wish on the star. Until we get out of this terrible situation, there's not much that I can do for you. - [Tim Voiceover] Okay, I could take care of that. I just need to slow down the deputy. That's right, put your head in. - Stupid dog. Hey, hey, hey. Let me outta here. (light music) - Good job, lad. We better split. - [Tim Voiceover] Split up? I can't do that. I'm a felon now. - Don't look at me like that. I'll be back, I promise. Get out of this blasted weather. - Let me out, you stupid dog! - Poor guy was wriggling like a bug on a pin. I couldn't leave him like that. All right. See you around, flatfoot. - You dumb dog, come back here. (shouting) - [Tim Voiceover] I ran all over town trying to lose him. He was slow but persistent. When I did lose him, I ended up at the park. It was the last day, Christmas Eve. I was beginning to accept the fact that I was going to be a dog from now on. And nothing in this world was ever going to change that. Then it happened. I saw him. There he was, the bane of my existence. Carmody was bullying some other kid. (dog barking) Something inside me finally snapped. (upbeat music) (Carmody panicking) (upbeat music) (dog growling) - [Olaf] Dog. - [Tim Voiceover] Ha ha, I chewed the seat out of his pants for about 20 minutes. He folded like a deck of cards and blubbered like a baby. All I had to do was stand up to him (laughs). Revenge was sweet. I decided to go home. Oh man, of all the roads to pick. - You dadgum dog. (engine starting) (upbeat music) (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] I figured that maybe I could hide in that truck. Yeah, I'll just lay down in there, and he'll never see me. Oh no, Slade. Wrong truck, time for Plan B. - You cost me plenty, you no good son of a- - Don't shoot, Owen. - It ain't you I'm pointing at, Harvey. It's him. - It's pointing at me. - Well then get out the way! - Drop the shotgun, Owen. Drop the gun! - You're letting him get away. - Drop it! (groaning) (light music) - [Tim Voiceover] What do you know? That worked out pretty good. - [Harvey] You can't go waving your gun at people, Owen, you imbecile. - [Owen] I told you I wasn't pointing at you, Harv. - There's not quite enough climb in your bell, is there, you idiot? - [Tim Voiceover] Ha ha, those two corn flakes were made for each other. (phone ringing) - [Mary] Hello. - [Harold] Is this Mary? - [Mary] Yes. - [Harold] This probably won't make a lotta sense to you, but I have a note to call you about Tim. - Tim? Where is he? Is he all right? - [Harold] Well, no, I mean, I don't know where he is. I just have this note someone left for me to tell you he's okay. I shoulda called yesterday, but I thought it was, you know, a prank. - Who is this? You have seen him, haven't you? - [Harold] No, sorry, I found the note when we got to West Valley, and then I saw the picture in the paper. - West Valley, that's over 100 miles from here. - [Harold] Like I told the sheriff, I never really saw him. - No, oh no no no, wait, please please, don't hang up. Hello. (line going dead) Hello, hello? (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] I had no idea what to do. Staring at the downtown Christmas decorations, I realized that there was no place for me to go anymore. I just wandered around for a while and ended up back at the park. As it turned out, that wasn't such a good idea. (light music) I didn't see Deputy Dimwit until I was almost right next to him. Oh boy, just my luck. I tried to be inconspicuous. You know, kinda sneak past him while he was stuffing about 300 potato chips in his mouth. And then take off. (upbeat music) - You! - [Tim Voiceover] Too late, he was after me again. (upbeat music) (groaning) (light music) - [Girl] What a doofus. - [Girl] I know, I can't believe it. (upbeat music) - [Tim Voiceover] I'd run him around until he turned into butter, that should do it. (upbeat music) It was like being in a pinball machine. I decided to take the back alleys and sidewalks home. You know, keep outta sight. That way, if he was still looking for me, I figured he wouldn't ever find me. I was wrong. (dog whimpering) Oh, man, terrific. - Now I got you, you mangy mutt (chuckles). (dog barking) There you go. (light music) County pound'll be here this afternoon. - [Tim Voiceover] The guy obviously didn't know he was dealing with the world's smartest dog. (light music) (radio chattering) It didn't look too tough. Just one tiny latch on this cheap cage. Little push with the hold paw. And I was a free dog again. How this guy ever got hired by the sheriff's department was beyond me. He drove all over town with an empty cage and never even knew it. (soft music) - Got ya (laughs). - Merciful heavens, not now. - I knew if I looked around long enough I'd find you, and here you are. - You don't understand. There isn't time. - Oh, there's plenty of time, all the time you want, in your cell. - I'm warning you. I could make a wish, and you'd be very sorry. - I'm very sorry already. Sorry I didn't throw you in the hoosegow when I first had the chance. - It's true, you know. I can say certain words at just the right time, and you wouldn't ever be the same. - Oh yeah? - Mm. - Well go ahead. (soft music) (giggles) - [Tim Voiceover] I always ended up in the same place, it seemed. I couldn't go home yet, because the deputy was still out looking for me. I hid under a boxcar until it was dark. I had never been so lonely. It began to snow again, and I thought about everything that had happened. - All you ever think about is what you want. - You should try being an animal sometime. - This is too weird. - Good doggy. - Who are you? (wolf growling) - Now I got you, you mangy mutt. - What is that you want from life? - [Tim Voiceover] I just wanted to be Tim again. (traffic passing) ("Silent Night" instrumental music) When I got home, Haley was there. - I thought you might be here. - [Tim Voiceover] What a friend she was. I wished I could tell her. - What the professor said is so weird. Things like that don't really happen. I just wanted to give this back to you. - [Tim Voiceover] Gee, thanks. At least my neck'd be warm. - Haley. - Hi, Mr. Webster. - What are you doing out here? It's freezing. Come on inside. - [Tim Voiceover] I'm coming too. - Is there any news about Tim? - Well the sheriff's station called a little while ago. They said they had some lead with a transient. It's probably nothing. - Well, I better be going. I'm really sorry about Tim. - I know you are. Thanks, Sweetie. - [Tim Voiceover] Thanks, Haley, you're the best. - Oh, don't forget your dog. - Oh, he's not mine. - I saw you messing with the scarf, I thought. - It's his. - [Tim Voiceover] It's mine, Dad. - Bye. - Bye. - [Tim Voiceover] Hi, Mom, it's me. - What's this dog doing here? - He just kinda wandered in. - This is Tim's scarf. - Are you sure? - Yes, where'd you get this? This is Tim's scarf. - Haley. Haley? Could we talk to you for a minute? - [Haley] Sure. - Thanks. - [Mary] So there's some connection between Tim and this dog? - I think so. The professor said that somehow Tim and the dog were involved together. It's pretty crazy, actually. - [Tim Voiceover] Not that crazy, actually. - Well reality hasn't worked, so maybe crazy's the answer. - Well this really was crazy. This dog is so smart. He's really smart. - Well, he seems to know us. But how? I mean, we don't know any dogs. Well, not personally. - Tim would love him. - Yeah, he would. - He does seem to know us. - [Tim Voiceover] I do, Mom. You just don't know me anymore. - Well I better be going. I don't want my parents to worry about me. - Good idea. Let me walk you to the door. - I know my way. If I could have a dog, this would be the one. - [Tim Voiceover] It was probably the closest I was ever going to get to kissing her. - Take care of them till Tim comes home. Night. - Night, Honey. - Good night. (door opening and closing) - Do you think the dog could stay with us tonight? - Yeah, I think he could. - Do you know where my baby is, boy? Do you? This whole thing was my fault. - [Henry] No no no, I'm the one who kept saying no about the dog. - He's out there somewhere. He's all by himself. What if he's hurt? - Don't do this to yourself, Mary. Maybe we'll hear something tomorrow. Things happen on Christmas. (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] It was almost midnight, Christmas Eve. It was over. (clock ticking) (soft music) I was going to have to get used to slobbering a lot. As I thought about that, I wondered where the professor was tonight. And then I thought I heard something. (soft music) It was him. He came, all right! (soft music) - Hey there, boy. Oh, I'm afraid I've let you down, Tim. - [Tim Voiceover] No you didn't. It was my fault, not yours. - But I brought someone with me. - We shouldn't be here, Professor. - Ah ah, no. - Are you sure? - Yes. It's the only way. Besides, it is worth a try, isn't it? - It sounds so crazy. - I know it does. - [Tim Voiceover] What, what are you talking about? - But you do care for Tim? - [Tim Voiceover] Huh, what's going on? - Really care? (soft music) Well do you? - Yeah, I've liked him since the second grade. He just doesn't know it. - [Tim Voiceover] Really? Why didn't you say anything? (dog barking) - I just don't know if I believe in this enough for it to actually work. - A wish from the heart, Haley. Now that's what's needed here. A wish from the heart. - What do I say? - What's in your heart? What do you really want? - [Tim Voiceover] Yeah, what? - But you better do it now. - I want Tim to be here, like he was. A boy. (triumphant music) - Yes. (soft music) - [Tim Voiceover] Nothing, still a dog. It didn't work. It was a good try, anyway. I guess I knew deep down that it wouldn't. - Oh my. (soft music) That's it. It's past midnight. - Didn't work. - I'm afraid not. - [Tim Voiceover] I better get used to walking on four legs. - Oh, Tim, I'm so sorry. I so hoped this would work. It was the only thing that I could think of. Well I better be going. - I'll come with you. - [Tim Voiceover] They gave it their best shot. It was all they could do. And I loved them for it. (soft music) It was over. Nothing left to do but get under the covers and go to sleep. (soft music) (sighing) (soft music) (soft dramatic music) - Oh, Henry! Henry! Tim! Henry, Tim. - Tim! - Baby, where have you been? Are you all right? - You had your mother and me worried sick. - Tim. What do you mean you're not a dog? You're my baby. - Look at you, are you okay? - I'm never gonna let you outta my sight again. - I was a dog. I was on the street. I was cold. (upbeat music) - [Mary] What do you mean you were a dog? (gentle music) - I wanna know when did you guys find the time to get the things that you put in my stocking. - Oh, a little elf helped us. Yeah, we had a little help. - But how did you get out from under my eye? When did you plan it? - Hey, that's the magic of Christmas, right? Oh, did I tell you? The company called, and I landed the Valentine's Day account. - Oh, Honey, that's great. - Oh, and ... I've got something to say. Your mother and I have one more Christmas present for you. - You guys didn't have to do that. I'm just glad to be home. - Oh. - I know, but when you were telling me about Owen's dog, I got to thinking. Well let me put it this way. On this glorious day, when family-- - Honey, what your father's trying to tell you is that he called Mr. Slade. - Did you tell him off? - No, I wanted to ask him something. - What? - I'll show you. Ta-da. - [Mary] Surprise. (dog barking) - Ralphie. But. What? He's alive. - That's right. Yeah, I was able to track Owen down. He was in jail. I don't know why, but anyway, he found him. The bear didn't kill him. And I knew he wouldn't pay the vet bill, so I made him a deal. Merry Christmas, Son. - Thanks, Dad. - Hey, you. Listen to me. You stay close, real close for a while, okay? - Don't worry, Mom, I will. - Oh, humor your mother. (laughing) - Hey. Let's take a walk. (parents laughing) (upbeat music) - Come here. (upbeat music) Go get it, boy. Go get the ball. Go get the ball. (upbeat music) Good boy, good boy. You're my best friend. Go get it. - I thought I was. - Oh, hi. - What did you get for Christmas? - Well, I had a dog. - Mom told me they found you. - No, they didn't find me, you did. - You mean? - Yeah, the professor was right, Haley. - Was that really you? - Yeah. You believe me, don't you? - I don't know. (soft music) - Since the second grade, huh? - Do you still lick your friends? - No, actually I figured out something better. - That is better. Isn't it, Muffin? (cat meowing) - Well, actually, I think that might be your late Aunt Minnie. A friend of mine told me that. (soft music) Will you help me find my dog? - Sure. - [Tim Voiceover] And that's exactly how it happened. The most special Christmas of my life. The Christmas I was a dog. (dog barking) - Come on, come on, let's go. - [Tim Voiceover] Nobody ever saw the professor again. Or that big deputy, for that matter. I don't know for sure, but I think that maybe they ended up together. - Don't complain about the weather to me. Look, I told you, Deputy, but you wouldn't believe me. Ah, some people are so pigheaded. - [Tim Voiceover] But that's another tale.
