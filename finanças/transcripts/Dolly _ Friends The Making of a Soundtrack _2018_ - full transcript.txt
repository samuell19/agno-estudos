It's not technically a Dolly Parton album, it's a Dolly Parton soundtrack. It's amazing how this music has taken on a life of its own. To get to work with strong, talented women, you appreciate it. I know you're nervous. Of course I'm nervous. Dolly Parton is calling for me? This is really like a dream come true for me. Sorry. Oh, my gosh. - Well, good God. - Sorry. - Come here. - I just... Don't tell anyone about this. We are bringing both of our worlds into this project. There's that friction of her style versus my style. Instead of battling, we're coming together. Got the new 'ole Dolly. It's a funny story about Dumplin'. I got a call saying that Jennifer Aniston had taken the book and was gonna make it into a movie. I said I would love to do the music. I'm very honored and proud that, you know, that I've touched somebody enough to wanna write a book. I've been writing some new pieces, singing some songs with some different artists, for the soundtrack and writing with Linda Perry, who's producing the soundtrack for the movie. Very surreal, like when you have Dolly Parton singing... ♪ Catch you in it ♪ ...right in front of you. I'm watching Dolly Parton right now, record vocals. It's funny because we couldn't be any more opposite. Twig tea, you can try it. - What? - It's twiggy, - it's twig tea. - It's twiggy? It's twig tea. - Oh! I don't like twigs. - No. - No, she doesn't want a twig. - Is this like - a health food thing? - Yeah. She doesn't want no health... I don't want nothing healthy, I'll die. Just put a scoop of lard in there and that'll be good. Yeah, put some bacon grease in it and honey in mine. It doesn't make any sense if you don't have the confidence to work with somebody like Dolly. And we wouldn't get anything done, I would be too intimidated to, you know, boss her around or, not that I was bossing her around. She's bossing me around. I can take you out. - And it'll be... - I can take you out too. So I want you to go in there and be Dolly. I believe I can handle Dolly. Well, you holler... and I know you're the producer, so don't... if you need me - to do it different. - Yeah, no. I mean, I know I would do it my way but I'm not producing this song. - Well, I want you to do it your way. - -I know. Well, if you want me to do it different, tell me. - I will, don't worry. - And then I'll knock your head off - and say I'm not doing it your way. - I'm an Aries. - I'm aggressive. - Okay. Here, she's always saying that I'm right all the time. You not gonna be right all the time. She's gonna be saying she's right all the time. I'm gonna say, I'm right sometimes. - Are you good with no harmony on this one? - I'm good with this. Yeah. If she's doing the low, that's probably all we need on this. We're good. - Okay. - Yeah, great. All right. Just like you said to start with. You got it. So the whole take again, please. Yeah, another track, do you have any thoughts? No, you're doing great. I love all, I mean, what am I gonna tell you? Well, you're gonna tell me what you need to tell me. I'm telling you, you're great and just do it again, exactly the way you want to. I like that there's someone that finally you've met your match, Linda. We have.

Linda did all these different bonus tracks with all these girls and I was afraid that she's gonna make them too pop and they wouldn't fit in the theme, the styles, the spirit that I had written them in. But she managed in some genius way, to take that and she just interwove into such a way, it's like a whole new sound, but it fits so well. Can you hear yourself okay? Got enough reverb on this track? - Can you hear me? - I can hear you. - Okay. - All right. ♪ What is this spell that's on me ♪ ♪ That makes me think you own me ♪ ♪ I just got screwed up and I'm gonna change ♪ ♪ Go back and fix it ♪ That was really good though. - Here we go. - ♪ Holdin' on to you ♪ Have fun. ♪ Hold, holdin' on to you ♪ ♪ I'm so tired of holdin' on to you ♪ It's an amazing feeling, as a songwriter, to hear other people do your songs. ♪ Filling up my senses ♪ I love how she did that. Names have been thrown to us and we're just like, no, that doesn't feel right. They have to have a certain soul, they have to have a certain quality. All these artists have naturally, organically shown up. - Hi there! - Hi. - How are you? - Good, how are you? I'm excited, I'm so excited. How did it go? You already laid down your vocals, right? Yeah, I did... I did my part and we've comped a little vocal and so we're just gonna let you get in there and do what you do. Amazing, no pressure. Just... Yeah, I'll just go after you. It's fine. Well I'll... I'll go out, you don't want me staying? So my plan is, is that basically Dolly's in there, doing Dolly and let's just see what you do. She wants you to take a verse and - I know you have great ideas. - Cool. Like, she's so pure and... and... and real. She's, you know, she's your kind of people and I know this is gonna be a wonderful fit. So when this came up, I was like, we got to get Elle King. This is like one of the coolest things I've ever been a part of. So thank you. Well, what the hell? Go sing. There are a lot of people that sing good, but then there are some people who just have a sound, you know it the instant you hear it and she's got so much heart and so much soul and she's just unique in every way. ♪ Holdin', holdin' on to you ♪ For one of you in particular, this is potentially a dream realized. Yeah, it's her... it's a dream come true for her. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. It is true. Can I drink that? Whose is that? That's my water but you can have it. I can drink it? Yeah. I feel like if there's one person I'd drink after it's Dolly Parton. You're like, honestly, you're my hero. I mean, I don't wanna like seem soft or anything, but just the way that you carry yourself and the way that you... - I'm so sorry. - Aww. The way that you are to people and the way... Sorry. Oh, my gosh! - Well, good God. - Sorry. - Come here. - I just... This is tight. It's a tight jacket. It's a tight jacket. Don't tell anyone about this. This is really like a dream come true for me. ♪ Holdin', holdin' on to you ♪ ♪ I'll just keep holdin' ♪ - And we can swap those back and forth. I think so. So you should be in there with her. ♪ I'll just keep holdin', holdin' on ♪ - This song needs it. So we can just, you know, - if we're doing it together... - It'll be more natural this way. - You all right with that? - You take some and I'll take some. That's so cool. - You sound great. - Do I? It's always more fun to like do it together. - Well yeah, it's like old times too. - Yeah. I hadn't been singing that song for all these years... It's so good. - It's so fun. - But anyway, when they brought it out, I thought, wow, this is so, so neat and of course, Linda Perry, she did a real neat take on it, an arrangement. I think you can go unison and just take adlib, like take things over. You guys can trade. But she... it was very similar. Like my record, she didn't stray too far away, but it had this little feel and then you really added a great element to it, I thought. This is good 'cause now we can just look deep into each other's eyes. It's perfect. Oh! This is so cool. She not only is a unique individual with her look, but her voice is so great. ♪ Like a fool I'm holding on to you ♪ ♪ I'm holding on ♪ ♪ You don't want me, you don't want me ♪ ♪ You just hurt and disappoint me ♪ ♪ Like a fool, I'm holding on to you ♪ And our voices are... really just perfectly match, 'cause my voice is really different, her voice is different. We're both true stylists. ♪ Holdin', holdin' on ♪ We were going to the same notes at the same time without even hearing what the other one was gonna do on the song. That was cool, how we both did it. - Yeah. - I like that. How often do you write? I write a song every day I'd say, but like, a good one, I don't know, maybe once every 20 years. Ah, that's what I say. I've written 5,000 songs and I've got five good ones and that's about the truth. Thanks for singing with me. - Yeah, it was good. - Thank you. I hope you can make me a star. Oh yeah, I'm gonna make you a star. You stick with me kid, I'm gonna make you shine. My hair almost flew off. We both shouted... ♪ I wonder why we can't just love and be free ♪ ♪ Let everyone be all that they wanna be ♪ I'm using Mavis Staples, who I have loved since I was a kid. You look so pretty. You always look pretty. - Well, thank you, I dressed up for you. - Oh! Girl, please. Did I do good? And I asked Linda, I said, would you be okay, if I asked for Mavis to be on one of these things? It's an honor to meet you. - Thank you. - I mean, you're... - Thank you. - I mean, you're Mavis Staples. She said, "Yeah, Mavis has got that heart, she's got that gut, that soul." And so I reached out to her and she was excited about doing it. I love that you and me after all these years, are still at it. All these years, Dolly, yeah. We're still here. - We are. - Can't stop it. We're still... - We're a force to be reckoned with. - Indeed we are. And I love you, I love your singing. - I'm so excited that you're gonna be. - Thank you. I just want us to be down in history together. We're going down. - They can't leave us out. - No. - Especially you. - Well, especially you. - Are you ready, Miss Mavis? - ♪ Yes, I'm ready ♪ - I'm so happy. - ♪ I'm so ready ♪ You are ready. I'm so excited about just being here with this woman. I have loved her since the day she came out, her whole family. And that was when I first heard The Staple Singers, I thought, Oh my Lord! That's the greatest sound I've ever heard. And I fell in love with her. I'm only five-one. - Are you? - Yeah. - Well, I'm taller than you. - Are you? Well. Well, I'm five even. You could be five even too. But if I hadn't got so bunched up at the top, - I'd have been six-two. - Hey! I'll give you a spanking I sent word to see if she would be willing to sing, 'cause I wrote this song with her in mind. ♪ I wonder why we can't love and be free ♪ ♪ Let everyone be all that they wanna be ♪ It was like, I heard her.

You should have seen me. If I could have turned a flip, I would have. I said, Dolly Parton is calling for me? I'm just grateful. When we heard our voices together though, to me, it just ran through me like lightning. - Yeah. - It was really like a drug. It was like, wow! I felt like... You know, my... my hair almost flew off.

And the message in the song is just what I've been singing for years. And so it's just right on time for me and right on time for today. - Oh, we need it today. - We need it. I was thinking that too when I was writing it. Yes, indeed. 'Cause it's about acceptance and love with brothers and sisters and all of us, you know, just loving one another. - That's great Dolly. - I tailor made it to get you. ♪ Still we don't do it and I wonder why ♪ One line in that song was a tongue twister for me. ♪ Let's light the fire ♪ ♪ With love won't they light ♪ Love won't they light.

What they're really gonna say when they hear it, they're gonna say, "What a clever idea to have Mavis on this song." I'm serious. They'll think, wow! They're gonna think, wow, what a great idea. And they're gonna say, "How in the world is Mavis keeping up with Dolly?" You know? We're doing all right for two old bags. Two old girls? Yeah. Two old bags, right. ♪ But still we don't do it and I wonder why ♪ We got it. We got it! - Say hi to Dolly and Mavis. - Well hello. Hey! - Hey, Macy! - Macy Gray. Great to see you! We're finishing up our little piece and then we're gonna get after you. I know, I'm listening. You're making me all nervous. I don't know how I'm gonna follow that. I just love the fact that Linda and I, both are getting the people in that we want. To have Mavis and Macy and all of a sudden poof! You know, it just turns into magic. Lightning in a bottle. I kinda... kinda couldn't breathe 'cause I was... I was trying to be, you know, cooler. I said, "Hey Dolly, how you doing?" But as soon as she walked away, I don't know what I was gonna do. I almost started running. Proud to have you here. When Linda said, "what about Macy?" And I said, "Are you serious? You think she would do it?" And she said, "Yeah, I think she would." So I thought that would be the coolest thing. So just to have that heart, that soul, that unique, special sound. And just with somebody that I also admire. It was really a nice thing. Who ever knows how you're gonna wind up and how you're gonna sound together. But that's how great duets are born. We did "Two Doors Down," my old song and it's just a full on party kind of sound but she brought such great things to it. And just all the adlibs and... Oh, I love... I love the song. It's a fun song about people partying, drinking and having a good time and you're there, - with your broken heart. - All alone. And then all of a sudden you decide to join the party and before you know it... - Yeah. - ...you're partying with them right in your house. Heartbreak over. ♪ Yeah, two doors down ♪ ♪ They're lovin', and drinkin' and ♪ ♪ Having a party ♪ ♪ Two doors down, they're not aware that I'm around ♪ "Islands In the Stream," that's one of my favorite songs in the world. I don't remember the first song I heard of yours, I just remember the things that, visually, that I never forgot. Well, I'm hard to forget, I look like a cartoon, don't I? Still do. I just think it's the life of an artist, you know, you get to do magical things, you know, and that stuff. With all the sacrifices you make and all the things you have to do without. So I think that's the payoff. You get days like this, you know what I mean? I think you kind of set the example for... for how far you can go, you know? Because you did country and there's a lot of people who are your fans, who are not country fans. Kinda set the whole icon thing. You kind of showed everybody, especially women, what's... what's possible. - Have you met Linda yet? - Uh-uh. She's a tiny little ol' thing with a great big talent. - Hey! - And a funny little hat. Hello! How are you? - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you. - I like your little hat. - Thank you. - Ain't she a cutie? - She is. Wait 'til you hear these tracks.

Amazing. Linda and I are offering beautiful things to each other, on a musical level, that's really inspiring to both of us. So tell me what you need me to do. Okay, so today we're gonna do "Dumb Blonde," and that's the one you're singing with Miranda. So, I did the harmony one, where it will be what Miranda will be doing. Do you wanna try singing to that just to see... play around with that vibe? To sing a little harmony? Aw, hit it, boys. Hit it good. ♪ Don't try to cry ♪ ♪ Your way out of this, don't try to lie ♪ ♪ Or I'll catch you in it ♪ ♪ Don't try to make me ♪ Did you forget I was little?

And she welcomed mine 'cause it put her in another place. So I don't want you to sing that, I just want you to sing with it. - So take her vocal out. - Oh! - Oh, that... the phrasing. - Yes. It's a different melody. Well, no, it'll be just exactly just underneath you. - So you'll be able to sing... - Let me go in there with you. - Yeah. - Let me hear it till I get it right. We are bringing both of our worlds into this project. ♪ Don't try to cry ♪ Oh, you need me to sing another part? ♪ Your way out of this ♪ No, you're just being exactly you but maybe if this is in, you'll work around it.

Okay, I see what you're saying. So yeah, it's just being aware that that's what her part will be. Well, yeah, 'cause I didn't hear that at all, - I wasn't trying to phrase with that at all. - Yeah. Is she singing all the way through? All the way through then she cuts out, I think, on the second verse and then comes back in. But I could sing a harmony part with her, on a higher part, if you wanted her to maybe do the second verse? Yeah, but no matter what, she would be under. - Okay. - You know what I mean? - Yeah, okay, I see what you're saying. - I think to have you, - it would be great. - All right, we got it. All right, here we go. ♪ Oh, but somehow I live through it ♪ ♪ And you know if there's one thing blonde has learned ♪ ♪ Blondes have more fun ♪ - ♪ For my old spool ♪ - Punch in right there. Well now, she'll phrase with me but that's basically... Yes, she's gonna phrase with you, but I just wanted you to understand and be aware of that's gonna be a harmony. - Mm-hm. - Because she probably learned that harmony. - Yes. - It'll work on no matter what you do. I'm just letting you be aware of it. No, that helps. ♪ Just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb ♪ ♪ 'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool ♪ No she ain't. So amazing. Miranda's here. - Oh great! - And we're on time though. Hello. How are you? - Oh! - Nice to meet you. I feel like I have known you all my life. I do too. They said, you're gonna meet Miranda for the first time today, and I said, I am? I was in the elevator with you one time, but I got too scared to say hi. I mean, I really feel like I knew you and I said, "Oh! That can't be so." They said, "You've never met Miranda." I said, "Well, I've seen her, I know her, I feel like I know her." And so, it's not different. You feel just like I knew you would. - Good, you do too. - Oh! Good. I feel a kindred spirit with you but, I was nervous though, 'cause today is the first time like, actual face to face time. - So that's good. - It was good though. Didn't you feel that too? Like when we first met, it was like just three seconds and it's like I thought it would be and it is. Like I felt like I knew you, so good. I was so excited to have Miranda sing "Dumb Blonde" with me. Here we are, two blondes, anything but dumb. We might be a little silly but we're not dumb. I just want you to just feel comfortable. I know you're nervous, I can already see. Of course I'm nervous. The most important part is just emotionally being attached because... - I already am. - Yeah, I know you are. Anyways, because it's her. But it's like, just be you, you're amazing, you know and, um... I second that. - Yeah, I think you're... - I just need to record this and carry it around with me. And every time I feel nervous, just replay it. I just need the audio every morning. Well, what's great about you is that you're sassy. Like you have an edge, you know, so just bring that. This is why the song is perfect for you. And I think with that lower part, you know, because I love your lower register. You know, a lot of girls can't go low and be edgy. It just sits in this area. So just go do Miranda, and don't worry about that it's Dolly Parton you're singing with and that this is happening. - She knows me now. - Yeah. So, you know. She ain't nervous about that part. Yeah. Let's do this. Let's do it. I don't think you need to be told how to sing. I... well, if you... I will take it from you if you want to tell me. Well, not only did I get to meet Dolly for the first time today, but like singing one of her songs that's kind of a staple for her, with her and recording with her and Linda Perry. I feel humbled to be asked but I feel really proud to be with these two gals and all the women on the soundtrack, it's gonna be a powerful group of women and it's so cool to like not only get to just meet you, but actually sing with you the same day. ♪ Or I'll catch you in it ♪ ♪ Don't try to make me ♪ ♪ Feel sorry for you ♪ ♪ Just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb ♪ ♪ Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool ♪ Hearing my voice with Dolly is kind of surreal right now. I don't think I've processed it. Miranda reminds me so much of me, when I first came to town. There's a part of her that has a rawness, You know, a soulful kind of feeling about her, unpolished. I was really nervous. I was wanting to nail it 'cause you've been doing this song for a long time. - Yes, I have. - You know, and I... and I... 50-something years. Well, I'm just learning it, so I wanted to make sure that I was like, singing with you but still having my own personality. Well, you did a great job. I was real proud. It's a great song. It's perfect for us, I think. ♪ Just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb ♪ It's really a highlight of my life, not only my life, my career. Today is one of those like, bucket list days.

I'm like, I'll go out and do one take, but she gets it right. That's because it's perfect the first time. It's the highlight of your musical experience to get to be next to this greatness, and for so many of us just to hear it and then to even get just a little step closer to hear it, you know, through the headphones or to even participate or be asked. I can't compare it to anything else I've got to do. Don't you think you're spreading it out a little thick? - Nope. - No. Actually, I thought it was a little less thick than what I had to offer. Actually I held back. I can't even judge that kind of profession, I'm like. Oh, Lord, help us. I used to sing a lot with my sisters. And of course she sings with her family as well and being country people and really feeling that music down really in the gut, not just something you learn, you've lived that music, you love that music.

Amazing. On this take, can you do some now where you're on the off? So it's like, just your licks. You know what I mean? Basically when she's not singing? Yeah. So in between. Yeah. Then, I'm hearing with what you're doing, then I hear that Allison could probably do... Oh, yeah. I like it. Okay. When you listen to someone else, especially like Dolly, when you listen to that voice and just the rolls or what... Everybody calls them something different. I've heard trails, I've heard rolls, how we do the little things we do with notes, we just automatically do that naturally. And then when they blend together, it's real good. ♪ Nothing's gonna ever change it much ♪ ♪ If we don't ♪ I said, "Bring your mandolin, I want you to impress them with what you can do." She got in there and she was knocking their socks off. Even I was like taken aback, as they say. She was just killing it in there and I was so proud, I was like, that's my girl! Rhonda, the first time I heard her, she played everything and I remember sitting there with my mouth open, watching her play and hear Dolly say, that we were all in the same phrase is kind of a big deal for me. ♪ If I don't ♪ Good one! Nearly... nearly perfect. She came to me saying that I had this idea of how to do "Jolene" and I thought, oh yeah, okay, here it comes. Let's do the whole part. I thought, well I can't sing "Jolene" again. Just hold the note for a second and I'll show you what I'm talking about. Strings can ruin things. It just made it completely different, like it's another song altogether. It's gonna be simplistic pretty, enhancing, for drama. ♪ Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene ♪ It really seems like a very blessed project. You know how some things just seem to happen? Like they're meant to be? Like they're supposed to be? 'Cause then when that usually happens, all the elements that usually cause you all kind of trouble, everything just falls into place. The energy of both of us together is just... I think we're creating a different sound and that's the best place you want to be. - And I believe we're doing something different. - Yeah. Let's see how your voice just almost sounds like a harmony because your tone is different. Well, she came to me saying, "I don't know if you'll like this idea, I don't know if you'll feel like you're betraying yourself or whatever but I had this idea of how to do 'Jolene.'" And I thought, oh yeah, okay, here it comes. All right, here we go. You know, I can't re-record that because it's like, such an iconic song now. I call my string guy and I'm like, "I need you to do an arrangement, like Eleanor Rigby, but to 'Jolene.'" Yeah, there's something... Let's... yeah, it's like a half-step... -...tricky. - Yeah, we can get rid of that. - I would get rid of that. That is really a great idea. Dolly is gonna sing to a string arrangement of "Jolene," which is, I can't wait to hear. She's really slowed it down doing it like with strings. It just made it completely different. Like it's another song altogether. I think it'll work. You guys ready? - Yes, ma'am. - Okay, so we're at the top. This woman, like she's prepared to stay here till three AM with us, you know, and go the whole mile and I told her it's gonna be a long night and she was like, "I'm here."

We really do have a wonderful connection. I know my music, she knows her music, but the fact that we, luckily, teamed up and just seems to be working. To meet somebody, especially another girl, I've worked with a lot of men too but I've never worked with women in this capacity. I think it was just meant to be. Yep, and then all the artists that joined in, it's pretty great too because they have their own incredible, unique voices. So it's like you're getting little pieces of love everywhere, because everybody who joined in, really, from the heart, wanted to be a part of this. Well, it's a great honor for people to love me, as a person, to appreciate me as a singer and to appreciate me as a writer. 'Cause I've tried to figure it out. Just think how I got so lucky. It makes me feel meaningful. It makes me feel like my life's not been in vain. I have to believe it and I think that people can feel that. I knew that was my phone when I heard it, but I wasn't gonna admit it. Unless I got busted, like I just did. And I was like what the? You know. - Then I said, okay. - Beep. I said, I'll... Dollywood. You'll have to come some time. I'll get you in free. Like two in the night. This is like amazing, so I've blacked out. I don't know what we've done already. Hey, you produce, we'll sing. - Okie dokie. - And that's the end of our interview. And that... that... - Whether you like it or not, we're done.
