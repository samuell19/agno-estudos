You're the only one she ain't gonna beat. Mommy slapped the shit out of me last week. Oh, yeah. It's 'cause you told her to go to hell. You deserved it. She tells your father to go to hell all the time. She's grown. She can do that. Beauty's grown too. As long as we live in this house, we children. And children must honor... ...thy mother and thy father. It's in the Bible. You gotta do it. If we did everything the Bible say, we'd live in a pretty messed-up world. Bible is kinda fucked-up. Hey, Beauty, your voice. Mmm, I'll be fine. Switch with me. Why you always want what I got? 'Cause my nerves are bad. What? I don't know why, you don't do shit. She ain't never had a hard day's work in her life. Mm-mm-mm. Mommy makes me practice for six hours a day, and she yells at me the whole time. That's work. That ain't shit. Both of y'all can shut the fuck up. You know you love us. Right now, I don't. Beauty! Abel! Get your asses down here right now! Your father's home! Shit. Jas, you could come. - She ain't call my name. - Don't worry. I'll protect you.

It's just that I think you were ahead of your time. And Beauty's not? No. Beauty is right on schedule. It's easy. A blind man could tell you she's going places. It takes somebody who knows what to do... I can shape that to make something out of that... I can bring people to the table... ...so that everyone in America is gonna want a piece of her.

But truth is... he's simple. You know why? 'Cause everything been handed to him. That's why he always walk around with that stupid look on his face. But it'll go away. All of it will. He better appreciate this time now 'cause as he gets older, his looks will fade, as will his ability to talk women out their panties. And he would be sad and miserable. His wife will be bored, and his children will only love him because he is their father. And when he dies, nobody will remember his name. Not even his children will feel compelled to keep his memory alive. Fuck you too, Pop. Yeah, got his ass. Right? I got his... What a... Wait. What about me, Pop? I can't tell your future. Boy.

I think that's why I was so determined to make something of myself. I wanted my life to have meaning. But after a while... ...I realize I... have to settle for just being the head of my house. Shit. I wasn't even good at that. That's why it was so important to me that you make it. I thought, if you went far, I would too. I know. That's why it's hard for me to say this... but I need you to give me my cut. Cut of what? I'm the one negotiated that contract for you. You know what? I'm not doing this. I know you got a new apartment downtown. I even heard you bought your little girlfriend a car. Yeah, and where'd you hear that? You can't keep nothing from me. Is that why you wanted to see me? All I need is for you to pay me what you owe. I don't owe you shit. You owe me your whole life. I used to think that. But I don't anymore. Look at you. Just look at ya. I didn't think the business was gonna change you, but you up in here acting all crazy, and you ain't even had a hit record yet. But one day, I will. I'mma have a whole bunch of 'em. And while I'm celebrating, drinking champagne, everybody will be there... except for you. Those the last words you wanna say to your father?

Well, I would say she's magical. I... I agree. Thank you. And I think she's strong and confident. Her name is certainly fitting. It's true. She has a beautiful complexion. You ready? Of course I am. You're confident. That's good. Your father would be so proud. I know, Ma. Jas, can you put that thing away? This is a big deal. I wanna capture the moment. It's gonna be on TV. Not this part. What... what is that? They're practicing. Wha... You hear how slow they playing? If they play like that, you'll put everybody to sleep. I'mma go tell them to speed it up. Ma, they the house band. I think they know what they doing. They're used to playing for little white girls. You from the church. I'll be right back. Your mama still crazy. But if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here. Mmm, you look good. Just a minute. Listen, I ain't got all day now. Yo, who the fuck is that? It's the boy from the other apartment, the one complaining about the music. Why is he here? I invited him. What's up? Come on in. For me? Well, they ain't for me. Hey, I'm Sammy. I'm Jas. So you big-time, huh? Not yet, but I will be. Yeah? What makes you so sure? I have a gift. Is that right? Jas, tell this boy that no one can sing better than me. Can't nobody sing better than her. Well, we just gonna have to see about that, ain't we? Well, um, I just wanted to come back here, uh, wish you good luck, give you those. See you after the show. Why is he here? - Relax. - No. Don't tell me to relax. I just wanted him to come and hear me sing. Why? 'Cause I told him I was a good singer, and he didn't believe me. Is that the only reason you invited him? Yes. When this is all over... the only person I wanna hear applauding is you. I would applaud for you even if you fall flat on your face. I know. Who is it? It's time. ...and she has this aura about her that's magnetic. Yes. I was drawn to her right away when I saw her perform the other night. Mm-hmm. I don't think I've ever met someone quite like her. She's that kind of girl that only comes along once in a lifetime. It's... If I can say, it's like God was showing off a little bit when He made her. - Sure. - That He breathed it on her vocal cords... smiled when He made her spirit and laughed when He finished that face. I would agree. Yeah. I think, uh, she made... He made something truly special. Yeah, I... I just think that she's gonna change all of our lives. Ladies and gentlemen, Beauty.
