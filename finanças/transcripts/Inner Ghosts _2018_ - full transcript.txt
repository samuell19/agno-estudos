It's common knowledge that when we've forgotten something, it may be because we've failed to encode it very effectively. Because we were distracted while the encoding should have taken place or because we're having trouble retrieving that information. However, there are elements of the self that are too important and functional to fall under simple encoding, retaining, and retrieving. As I explained, the self isn't stored in just one place. It's located in various different areas of the brain. And at the same time, in the nowhere land. A magnetic imprint that is stored as an energy network. The research I submitted shows that if we can understand the mechanism of this magnetic imprint, it will be easier to access it even when the brain cells have become damaged, by for example, Alzheimer's. In this way it'll be possible to limit the amount of information loss in those patients. Is there any physical evidence that those magnetic fields exist? Oh, yes. We measured the oscillations on the magnetic field around the brain for long periods of time and the results showed a distinct pattern change as the subjects aged. Aged? How many years are we talking about? We couldn't do the test with human beings, it would've taken a lifetime just to measure the maturity of the self. We used mice and other small animals with a shorter lifespan. The next phase will involve using this knowledge in humans and seeing what the limitations are to the hypothesis and how to work around them. Can we claim a patent on those magnetic fields? I don't know if we can put a patent on the magnetic field, but I can tell you this. An individualized therapy, if effective, will cost money. It will involve an approach that uses both drugs and hardware. Maybe even implanted in the brain like a pacemaker, only much smaller. And these can be patented. Imagine if it allows us to communicate with comatose patients or cut in half rehabilitation or physiotherapy time by acting directly upon the inner brain, the deepest self. If effective, public pressure for the adoption of these new therapies will create a market in itself. What we are doing is opening up a whole new branch of medicine. And we will own it. Thank you, Doctor Stevens. It seems there are no more questions left. We will get in touch with you very soon. Thank you. Hi, thanks for coming. I'm so sorry we had to change the lunch plans. Oh, that's perfectly all right. We've just got to talk about your schedule for next week. Yeah. Um, mother, she wants to talk to you. Hello, sweetie. I'll leave you two alone. I'll be back later. Moira, what's going on? Why did Rachel have to leave us? I must thank you for giving Rachel a job as your assistant. It means so much to her. She was an excellent student. She really deserved it. You know I'd never given that position to anyone who hadn't proved herself. I wanted to thank you anyway. But that wasn't the reason that I asked Rachel to bring you here. The treatment isn't working anymore and I've reached the end of my options. I've decided to stop taking those dreadful drugs. I've been giving things a lot of thought and I've decided it's time to die. But so soon? I've had enough time to say goodbye to all my friends and put my things in order. I've got what I wanted. Of course I realize the sadness my passing will cause, especially to Rachel. But Rachel doesn't need me here alive, there is no death, I'll always be here. I want you to be the last person I say goodbye to. I want you to be with me when I pass. It will be good to have a close friend by my side and I know it'll give some peace to Rachel. Of course I will, my dear. And Helen, I have a request that I want you to consider. You were my brightest student, and the most gifted medium I've ever known. Now that I'm about to leave, I want you to consider continuing my work. I couldn't. I can't. Not after Lilly's death. I lost everything. But your gift wasn't lost, it's still there. Even after all these years. It's no use. I've given that up. I don't do that anymore, I'm not that person anymore. One cannot choose to renounce one's gift. A medium with your power, it's hard to believe you haven't made contact with the other side in all these years. Was it because you couldn't contact Lilly? You know she can't be contacted where she is. It's beyond your gift. I really can't. I know you have your research, it's a noble ambition, but if you want to touch memories inside the soul you'll have to go back. Sooner or later every medium has to go back to the other side. You know you will. Now, I want you all to take Dr. Planchard's paper and study it over the weekend because next week we're gonna be discussing the treatment to the latest stages of Alzheimer's. Yes? Should we include Dr. Planchard's study about cholinesterase inhibitors? Yes. In a nutshell, Dr. Planchard discusses two of the three cholinesterase inhibitors. Rivastigmine and Donepezil. For the third, Galantamine, you'll have to read the other paper I gave you. Mine. For people with severe Alzheimer's and for people with moderate Alzheimer's, when cholinesterase inhibitors don't work or aren't suitable, the only therapy. The patient in this case is an 84-year-old woman in Canada who will respond yes and no to simple questions while already in the terminal phase. All her memories were gone and she wasn't able to elaborate but she was still able to answer 84% of the questions asked. I don't like to use the term soul, Joanna. We're doctors, not priests. However, I will agree that in a personal context, yes, we are trying to talk directly to the living soul. But only as long as it's inside a living patient. And that makes a world of difference. Trust me, I've been doing this for years. That was a brilliant presentation. Now you're worth seven million. How does that feel? Feels like, um, seven million. Take the contract with you and see if it's all in there. Now, there is something that makes me feel uneasy. Mm hmm, what? You know how important this money is for us. Have you got a pen? You don't want to go over it? At least read it? John, I trust you. I hope you trust me, too. Oh, oh. How is she? - She's not good. - Oh. I don't have any strength left in me, I. I know, but you're not alone in this, okay? You know, no matter what they say, nothing prepares you for this. It's so hard. Anyway. She wanted you to be here, so maybe she has something to say to you and um, yeah, I just don't know what to think anymore. Let me take it from here, okay? Okay. Go ahead. Moira, can you hear me? Rachel's outside. She loves you very much. She'll be fine. I'll make sure she is. It's almost over, that's why I'm here. To help you cross safely and gently. I'm ready, my friend. You can go now, darling. I promise I'll take good care of Rachel. I can see you more clearly now. Please, don't say a word. They'll be listening. Your gift as a medium can only rival with your feelings as a mother. Your capacity for suffering cannot be matched. But you are only making things worse. Even though your intentions are good, you are doomed to fail. Forgive me. Please forgive me. As things fade away, I can see how powerful you are. But you have to do the right thing, Helen, before it is too late. You have to let the pain go. It's beyond me. I can't change things. Please, forgive me. It is not up to me to forgive you, but remember, in time you will see that death is just a way of coming back. She wanted you to have this. What's in it? I don't know. She wanted you to take over after she died. You know that, right? What are these keys for? I dunno. Mom never told me about this place. The documents say it was bought over 40 years ago. The whole building looks empty. It's been empty for years. How do you know that? Your mom told me vaguely once about a place she used when she first started training. It was long before my time. She never told me why she stopped using it. I didn't even know she owned it. Why would she keep it all these years? Can't you see she did this for you? She wanted you to use it. I'm gonna call the university, I'm gonna tell them you'll be late. Wait. I know you're still training, but pay attention. There's an entity to your left. Can you see it? No. I'm still just a clairvoyant. I can't see them. This place is full of them. I can use this. Come on, let's go. Very good, you've found a place. I thought you were going to use one of our labs. Oh, this'll work better than any lab. It's perfect. Helen, we've already discussed this issue. Regardless of the results, this research must look scientific, not paranormal. It will look and it will be scientific as soon as I can prove my theory. But to do that, I need to use paranormal methods. It's too unorthodox. First you go to the lab and work out your theories. I already have my theories, thank you very much. I'm trying to reach the living souls of patients whose brains are no longer functioning. But before I run the tests on real patients with real brains I must run the test on ghosts who've been functioning for years without a brain. Oh, can't you see how far we can advance after that when the time comes to work on the real patients? No. Yes. Let me do my tests on ghosts. What's the place? It's an apartment. It's amazing. The address is in the report. It's bursting with communication and the best thing is, it's shielded from most radio signals. You know you have to produce some actual results, don't you? That means leaving your ghosts out of it. Yes, but before I get to that, I must start the tests I asked you for. Have you got them? Yes, use these. I created them myself. But what if they don't work? I designed them for the living, not for the dead. Oh, they'll work, I assure you. In the meantime we have an agreement. I provide you with the funds you need, you let me work my way. You think I only care about the money. What if your tests don't work? Then I'll go back to the lab and do it your way. This I do vow, and this shall ever be, I will be true despite thy side on thee. This I do vow, and this shall ever be, I will be true despite thy side on thee. Hello, my name is Helen. My name is Albert. I am sensing that we have already met. Am I correct? You are correct. I was Moira's guide, and it was her wish that I become your guide after her passing. This place is shielded from many radio and other electromagnetic interferences. I'm sure you'll find the peace you need within these walls. I come for help. I'd like to learn more about what you retained from life. I brought a few tests I'd like to run on you if you don't mind. Not at all. But you will have to bring such notches into this table in order for you to better understand this. You see, we have developed a new form of communication to solve some issues. Some of them are highly experimental, and some of them very risky. I understand. Albert? Hello, Helen. We appreciate that you brought what we asked. I brought different kinds, I don't know what you plan to do with them. What we're about to do is a technique we have advanced. We think it is about time to show it to someone. Now, don't worry about the camera, just focus on the test you brought us. Yes. We're going to do an exercise with all of you, I hope. It's an exercise designed to test your mathematical capabilities. It will show how far you can go with progressively difficult tasks. You first. Please try to count backwards from a hundred. 100, 99, 98, 97... Stop. Now let's go back to a hundred. Now let's do it again, but this time in sevens. 100, 93, 86, 79. Can you do the same he did? But this time, instead of counting backwards in sevens, count in sixes. - 100. - 100. You now. Let's make it harder. Let's try in 13s. - 100. - 100. - 87. - 87. - 74. - 74. Who knows, we may even win a Nobel Prize 20 years from now. Take a good look at those photos. One of the entities asked me to place a loaded camera on the table. It took these pictures all by itself in the dark. I loaded the camera myself with a brand new and roll of film I bought only a few hours before. I also placed several other rolls of film on the table, unused. It's poetry in Latin. I haven't seen all the negatives yet, this is just a sample. Easy, Helen. You'll never be able to publish half of what you're finding. Few people will believe that you came to these conclusions by speaking to ghosts. You can't even replicate all of it in the lab, only in that apartment, and only you can do it. You're a medium. Most scientists aren't. In two weeks this apartment has given us enough material for at least two years' research. That was Moira's gift to me. That's not the point! The point is we have to pave the way for patents we'll claim five years from now. You'll need to detail the path really well, we can't have any mistakes here. And you are going to spend the next 20 years locked in lab trying to find a way to prove of this without every citing a ghost. Don't be foolish, Helen, otherwise we won't get a Nobel Prize. That's the game. Hmm, I can tell by your silence that I'm right. You were lucky that I believed in you even though I never saw a ghost. You can thank my medium mother for that. But you knew the day would come when you'd have all this data that you can't prove or even discuss. Well perhaps you can tell people and they may believe you or not, but no one will sign a 20 million dollar check to fund a revolutionary new treatment based on your findings with ghosts. It's just not going to happen. What do you want me to do? I want you to keep your promise. Present some verifiable data that will appease the investors but make sure that it's scientifically sound. They gave us the money to buy the equipment and hire the people, now you have to feed them results so they keep the money flowing. If you can present the findings on that cassette in a presentable manner, it'll be more than enough for now. I need to find a way to present all this in a way that won't raise suspicions. I need time. You have very little. It's ironic that you mentioned the Nobel Prize. That letter arrived yesterday from Karolinska Institute. Swedes don't waste any time. They've heard about your grant and what you're planning to find it. Seems that it's years ahead of what they've been finding. Now they want to know what we're doing and they want to join us. They even want to share our costs. Isn't that amazing? Everybody wants to make us rich and famous. But what am I going to tell them? They're at the forefront of the field and they have the research to back it up. You have ghosts. You told them about mapping the brain's magnetic fields. You told them about the technology to act on it. That's what you have to find. And keep those photos out of sight. They're fascinating, but they aren't good enough for what you're doing. Excuse me? Dr. Stevens? I'm Helen Stevens, yes. How can I help you? I'm sorry if I interrupted something. That's all right, I'm just on my way out. What can I do for you? Well, I know some people, they told me about you. Oh, sorry, I don't have much time. Can you get straight to the point? Well I've been looking for someone who will understand. I need help. I don't know what to do. Who did this to you? Have you called the police? The police wouldn't believe me. I was told you would. An entity did this to you? It's happened many times before. Ever since I was a child. And it stopped without any explanation. About six months ago I started to feel its presence again lurking around me. Then it started to break things. A few days ago it attacked me. Hasn't stopped since. Helen. Hey, I thought you'd left by now. Oh, I'm just on my way. Uh, this is my assistant, Rachel. - Hi. - Hi. Oh my God, I'm sorry. Are you Elsa Lund? Yes. I'm such a huge fan! The Red Demon Series, I've got them all, they're amazing! You know her? Yeah, you don't? Elsa is a graphic artist, she's a demonic graphic artist. The pitchfork, the demon, right, from the movie? It was her. You draw your visions. It's all right, Rachel has the gift, too. I've never tried to develop my gift, but I realize that was a mistake. I need to know what to do, I need help. I can refer you to some people I know, they can train you. But I was told you were the best and money's not an issue. It's not a question of money. I haven't trained anyone in years. Look, please, I don't think I can survive another attack. We can help you. It looks like you have two students now. Wow! Is this where you design your creatures? Yeah. It may be a silly question, but why do you create these things? I see these entities all the time. They come in dreams and often during the night. You see them? I really only see the one that's been following me. All the others come in dreams and feelings that I have. I, I, I can't hear them, I can only see. Psychiatrist once told me to draw them and talk to them. Psychiatrist, huh? So I started to draw them and people started to like them. That's how I started my career. They say I give a very accurate vision of hell. If only they knew. Elsa, come here. Close your eyes, clear your mind. I see. There's somewhere I'd like to take you. I'm afraid there aren't many plates, place is empty. Well, I guess no place is ever empty, you know what I mean. - Rachel. - Yep? Think I saw some paper napkins in the kitchen, - can you get them? - Yeah, sure. You all right? I know this place. Have you been here before? Yes. No, it's a deja vu, I don't know. Is it any connection with the entity that hunts you? I can't say. Is it a haunting? Could it be a poltergeist? No, I said hunt, not haunt. Poltergeists never get that personal. And this is personal. And it's hunting around you. Is there any way of sending it away? No, but there's a way of making you more robust. We can develop you further so you can better control your sensitivity. You'll become of less interest to it and gradually it'll grow tired and go away. Sounds perfect. Helen, when did you discover you were a medium? That's a long story. A very long story. You? I can't say. I've always seen those things. Not people, just those things. I can't hear them, they rarely try to speak to me. They just show themselves. Even though I try to speak to them, tell them to leave, there's never any sound. Sometimes they try and show me images, then it all goes blurry. What kind of images? They come in dreams. They're usually centered around a girl somewhere. Someone I've never seen. Don't even know if she exists. I know she's dead because they show me her death. How does she die? She jumps off a building. And then she vanishes. And you don't know where she goes? No, I don't. I usually wake up, but that's the question they always seem to ask. The entities that appear to you, they want something from you. You may not know what it is, but you may think there's nothing you can do and nothing you will do for them, but they've been patiently observing you. Waiting for the moment when you'll give them what they want. They slowly, discreetly, meticulously, move things in the direction they want and it's up to you to get out of this state of things. What should I do? First thing we're going to do is help you expand your abilities. And it will be easier to get on if you two trust each other and rely on each other's gift. Which is a sad word for something that isn't a gift. Well, when we die our conscience becomes pure energy. It's certain that because of that, we become more susceptible to electromagnetic influences much more so than when we were alive. So electricity matters. Yes. Light bulbs, the sun, other living creatures. They can all have an effect on entities. It's like trying to speak in a club which is filled with loud music. That was the 20th century's gift to us, filling our environment with noise and energy and disrupting a dialogue that's been taking place since the dawn of mankind. It's not that the entities aren't there, it's that we're the ones who can neither see nor hear what they're saying. That's why they always come in the dark. There's nothing like the dark. Of course we, we can get pretty much the same effect if we keep the electromagnetic noise to a safe minimum. In other cases, there's a certain type of energy that attracts a different type of entity. And those phenomena are misunderstood, they're much more physical than spiritual. You mean our laws are the same. Yes, of course. Dead or alive we're all in the same universe. Governed by the same laws. Basically, there are three types of ghosts. The first doesn't have enough energy to move. It takes a lot of energy to go against the air and cross a road, air is a very poor conductor. When these ghosts appear, they communicate but rarely move. The second type of ghost has much more energy. They can move through the air, follow you around, and even appear to perform basic tasks. But even these ghosts will never go through a wall. No ghosts will go through a wall if that wall makes them lose energy. Think about it. Bricks, fiberglass, drywall, these are no good if you're made of energy. Even these ghosts will always choose an open door. Although there are some who are capable of opening them which explains the many accounts of doors opening and closing by themselves. It's all true. My mother always used to complain that I'd leave doors open. Now, the third type. Those are the dangerous ones. They can move through walls if they want, they can cause short circuits and even fire. They can cause great harm and hurt you in lots of different ways. They feed off other ghosts who avoid them or attach themselves to the living. While the other ghosts are benign, these types get frustrated because they're not alive despite all their power. Then they grow into something evil. Like the one who's after you. They're capable of sucking large amounts of energy from various different means. AC outlets, kitchen appliances, and so on. And then they use that energy to affect you. Like when they try to show you something. They'll never go away until you can control your capacity to read them. But they always used to come to me in larger numbers as a child. Yes, well, ghosts go where the energy flows. What people do fail to realize is that it usually happens when children are playing and the attraction is not because they're children, but because children come charged with energy. Grown ups can do it too, just roll in the carpet. Fill your clothes with electrostatic energy. You'll find most ghosts will come closer. Elsa, give me your hand. God, it's cold. Yes, well, I'm scared. It's all right, let's just relax and speak quietly. It's important at this point to keep it and even the noise we make to a minimum if we want to hear further. They'll start speaking to you very soon. Now we're all sisters and we must love each other as deeply as that. Rachel, take your sister's hand. No, no, no, it's all right, this is just beginning. It's all right. Maria is here, she responded to your open hearts. Don't let it go. Fear only destroys what we're trying to build. Now calm down. Elsa, you're a visual medium, open your eyes. I'm afraid to. There's nothing to be afraid of. I assure you you won't see anything to scare you unless you want to. Trust me. Don't be afraid. You did nothing to them. You owe them nothing. There's nothing to be afraid of. Maria just wants you to know that she's here. First type? Correct. It's all right, darling. Maria wants to tell you something. She says blessed are those who come in the name of Christ. It's all right, darling. There's a man called Albert. He says that uh, they recorded precious information on the film. He's talking about a hunter. It's okay, darling. Relax, now breathe deeply. Don't worry, don't worry, that was only a doppelganger. It was only a doppelganger. A mirror image of the hunter designed to confuse and scare. That's why it's gone so quickly, they don't last long. The real entity is hiding somewhere observing you. It's all right, it's gone now. What's a hunter? A hunter is an evil entity. It's not yet fully a demon, it wants to become one. It's trying to become one. It can do horrible things. It's often commanded by demons acting on their behalf. But if it's not a demon, that's a good thing, right? Actually no. Hunters are very rare. The demons in this case are looking for something that only a hunter can get. Remember what I told you about the 20th century? Yes. All the electromagnetic noise and technology it brought made the life of demons much harder. What do you mean? The hunters in this case are investigating, learning, searching for something that only demons can use. A crack through the wall. We've made their work all the harder with all our noise. And now they're biting back. It's up to us to find out what it is. Looks like a design for a patent. How old is it? Looks like something from Thomas Moss or Edison or Tesla or someone from those days, or earlier. Oh, seems like an incomplete telegraph that's connected to an infinite distance through an infinite cable. A kind of telegraph? Defective one, but yes. Oh, how do you operate it? I don't see how it can receive anything or how it's operated. Ooh, it's half a telegraph system at best. Don't tell me this is one of the negatives the ghost gave you. Yes. Are you out of your damn mind? How are we supposed to make this look scientific? We don't until we see if it works! We're scientists, not witches for God's sake. The more I trust you, the more I think you're helping us to make this amazing leap into the future, the more you bury yourself in shit. You know I'm right. Then we'll be right and broke. The fucking Swedes will pick up where we die, is that what you want? I have to submit a report based on what we're doing. Something that's supposed to be a technological breakthrough and you bring me this! Fuck you, Helen. You're fired! I signed a contract. Well I didn't. Hey. Gosh, these notes are incredible. Did they actually write all of this? Mm hmm. I couldn't work out what the diagram meant so I took it to Dr. Steinman. That went down well. Anyway, he thinks it's some sort of communication device or sort of telegraph. Can I see it again? Mm hmm. There you go. What matters is what it does. If we manage to find out how to make it work and control it. This looks simple enough. Let's build it. What? Let's make one. Okay, I'm gonna need these two 3D printers. I'll take these. Here you go. - All right. - And this scanner. Yes, I've got it. Okay. Think that's it. - That's it? - Let's go. Are you building it all in plastic? A few parts, yeah. What about the other parts? Well I can't print the copper and ceramic parts here, but I can operate the larger printers back at the studio. Should be ready by the time we get there. Oh, all right. You'll go then, I'll stay here, yeah? Perfect. Done. You, you know I can't see you. I can hear you. I'm not afraid of you! Don't be afraid of me. Why are you afraid of us? Stay hiding. Don't look! Helen, are you okay? I feel something. Something I haven't felt in years. There's something going on back at the apartment. We've got to go. Okay, I'll get the pieces, let's go. Rachel! Hey, it's all right. I'll stay, you go and have a look. It's all right, darling. What? What happened? - I saw it. - Oh no. It's all right, it's all right. Here, here, here, here, drink some water. It's all right. There. I saw it and it scared me. It's gone, it's gone now. It's all right. It's all right. Calm down, darling, it'll be okay. We're here now. It's all right. How's it going? This drawing doesn't say how the device works, but it's clear that it stores kinetic energy without the need for an external power source. How do you know? Well how else would it work? This comes from a time when electricity was a novelty. Perhaps that's why it was forgotten. Maybe it was ahead of its time. Can we try it? Well, it'll take some time to connect but I've got some cable. We can try. Besides, we've got to start somewhere. What? I feel something. Let me try something. What is it? Well, this scanner picks up frequencies outside the visual spectrum. Don't move, I'm gonna scan your body. What do you see? Something attached to you. It's the girl in my dreams. Oh my god. It's you. Who? The one that's been following me. It's, it's right here, it's! It's looking at you. Rachel, can you hear it? Yeah, I can hear it. Oh my God, it's the same laughter. I get it now, Helen. Those images she was talking about of the girl falling. It was Lilly. I recognized the drawings at the studio but I thought it was a coincidence but... There are no coincidences! It's following you now. It found you, it's laughing at you! I can see the son of a bitch. Wh-wh-what do I do? Concentrate and look through it. I can't. Yes, you can. It's not there physically, it's only there spiritually. Try to ignore it and see through it, your brain will obey. Ugh, it doesn't work! If you want you can get close to it and pass your hand through it, telling your own soul it's not there! Ah, its voice. Oh, it's filthy! Do you have any idea what this thing did to me at the beach? If it had wanted to hurt you it would've done so already. Besides, I know what it wants and it's not you. But it won't get anything! Not now! Not ever! It's gone. We should go home. We're all exhausted. We haven't slept in ages. There's something missing from this device. Seems to be very sensitive. Well you won't pick up anything during the day, there's simply too much noise going on. It's not just picking up signals, it's also sending back tiny currents that get stored near the coil. We'll just have to wait for nighttime. Oh, I can't stop now, I've almost finished. Rachel, why don't you go have a lie-down, hmm? What about you? I'll just stay till she's finished then we'll all go home. Okay. Is this the plastic that the entity was trying to manipulate? Yeah. It was trying to chew it. Eat it? Couldn't eat it, obviously, but it was chewing it. Spitting out bits of it. Half chewed, half melted. Why? It simply doesn't make sense that an entity would spend so much time trying to digest something it simply can't. It's absurd. And what about those coins? What was all that about? I don't make the rules. That's true. We don't make the rules, but this entity thinks it can. He's been watching you, us, that. We must be missing something. There must be something it's trying to achieve. God, I'm too tired. Wake me up when you're finished, hm, and then we'll go. I still remember it as if it was yesterday. No! - Helen! - Let me go! - Stop! - Lilly! Helen, stop! Let me go! Helen! My darling. Can you hear mommy? I know you're still in there. I love you. Don't be afraid. Now listen carefully, my love. A mother's heart is a fortress. They will never find you. Can you feel mommy's heart? You'll be safe here. Deep inside mommy's heart forever and ever and ever. Another day and you're still with me, my darling. Another day after so many years. I don't know who's keeping who. But thank you God for one more day. Rachel. Rachel. Come on. Hi. Hello, Rachel. Hi. Hope I didn't come at a bad time. No, not at all. Helen is resting, we've been working all night. What are you doing here? I came to talk to you about this. This doesn't concern you anymore. You fired me. This is my research now as it should've been in the first place. I need it. I want to test it in the lab. Are you out of your bloody mind? Do you think I'm gonna give you anything? Oh, get out, I've got work to do. Do you want me to call the police? That won't be necessary. All I want is the device. When I think of all things you said to me yesterday, you know, after all these years you never fail to surprise me. You're a disgrace to science! That only makes it worse. We've got to find Elsa. I can hear you. Don't let go of my hand. All I want is the device, Helen. This way. I can hear you! Don't let go of me. It's all right, darling. This way. - It's all right. - Towards the door. Pay attention. It's them. - They're afraid. - We don't want you to die. Don't let go. Oh, Helen! - Rachel! - Helen! Helen! - Helen! - Rachel, where are you? Helen! Rachel. Helen. Rachel! Helen. Helen! Rachel? Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! - Helen! - What's happening? It's in there with her! Helen! Don't touch her. Helen, open the door! Hey, what's going on? Helen! Helen. Helen, tell us what happened. She's lost it. Would you please shut up, can't you see what's happening? Please tell me what is happening. Dr. Steinman, please. Oh, that's brilliant. I have millions of euros worth of scientific research, freshly approved, hanging by a thread because you're all going crazy. You don't understand, do you? No, you don't understand. Do you know the magnitude of this? You just can't go nuts. What do you want? It's not what I want because I already have it, it's what it does. So, you found a way to build it using those printers. Did you test the thing? Not yet. Then we have a long night ahead of us. Start working. You're out of your bloody mind. Can't you see the state Helen's in? I'm a doctor too, we don't need Helen. If the device works at least partially, then I'll know we're on the right track and we can all go home knowing there's more happy work ahead. What if it doesn't? Then I suppose I'll have to find a way to explain that after some tragic event Dr. Helen Stevens and her loony assistants were replaced by real scientists. If Helen's theory is correct, a device like this could tap directly into a person's soul. All we have to do is to find out how to operate it. Oh, well, let me just check the instruction manual. Very funny. Can you control the current that runs into the device? The coils vibrate by themselves, affected by the electromagnetic fields that they encounter. The computer merely registers what comes from the device. Hopefully in 10 years' time a device with these same qualities will be implanted into the patient's head. It'll be amazing. And all this comes from ghosts. Truly fantastic. Do you believe it? The human mind has the most amazing capacity to justify its brilliance. If Helen believes she can talk to ghosts and come up with amazing concepts, that's fine. I'll believe her. But what really happens inside her mind is beyond her current ability to explain. Meaning? I believe in results. What happened will always be debatable. What can be patented is all that matters. Listen. It's talking. What are you feeling, Rachel? Um. I'm feeling uh something. Tell me exactly what you're feeling. Uh, I don't know, uh, light? Is that all? Yeah. No. - I don't know. - Oh, get up! What? I'm sitting in it myself, let's see what I can feel. And don't try anything funny. I can use this. What do you see? The field is stronger. More current is being generated. Hm, I see. Interesting. I could hear it but I couldn't understand it. Oh, I can understand it perfectly. Fascinating. Really fascinating. What happened? I made contact with the device. It spoke to me. It told me what to do. It told me exactly how to test it. You happy now, you fuck? What the fuck are you doing? Please don't. We'll do anything you ask us, we've already done that already! Of course you will. But you see, I understand what we need to achieve. Stop, think about what you're doing! What do you expect to get from her when she's dead? The device works with a living brain. You've seen it, it won't work with the dead. I don't want her to die, but. No! Now we can test this properly. Please call an ambulance, please! Helen, please tell me do you know who you are? Please. Helen, please tell me your name. Helen, please tell me your name. Helen, is that you? Please be a nice girl and tell me your name. Helen. Very good. Let's do an exercise. Try to count backwards from 100 in sevens. Please! Please! 100, 93, 86. She's going to die! Yes she is, and I think we've only one more minute before she passes away. - Helen. - Please. Do you know what happened? Your daughter? Fascinating. Christ's sake, I need to take you. Break the scanner now. Can't even feel a pulse anymore. Well, I suppose that part of our testing's concluded. I'm sure you agree with me the device works. I'll kill you. You'll burn in hell! I have to think about the next tests we're going to do tonight. I've got one test subject done, two to go. You fucking cunt. In the meantime, you stay here. And please, try to keep quiet. Otherwise I may have to hurt you. I could've prevented this. No you couldn't. You would be dead, too. What are we gonna do? I don't know. What's happening, what's happening? I don't know! You've been following me. The one that's missing. That's the one who's been looking for me all these years. That's the one who tricked my Lilly into killing herself. Isn't it? You train your children just like we train ours. And you used my life as your testing ground. Didn't you? You bastards. Those girls are innocent. You already got what you wanted. You don't need them, too. Helen. Please, tell me your name. Helen. Please, tell me your name. You stay here and please try to keep quiet. Otherwise, I may have to hurt you. I could've prevented this. No, you couldn't. You would be dead, too. Ugh, what are we gonna do? I don't know. What's happening, what's happening what's happening, what's happening? I have no idea! It's my scanner. I can hear. I can hear something approaching. I can hear it. I can hear something approaching. Can you see it? I can't see it. Can you see it? Stay quiet. What the hell is it, what's it doing? Oh my printer. Stay quiet! Can you see it? What the hell's it, what's it doing? What's happening? What's it doing? Stay quiet! What the fuck is that? It's printing itself. What is it doing, what is that? It's coming to life. Somebody help us, somebody help us! Somebody help. Help. Help. Help, help. Help. Oh my God. No! Please no! What the fuck is going on? Help, help, help, somebody help us! It's printing copies of itself. Stay quiet. Help! Help! - Help! - Help! Help us!
