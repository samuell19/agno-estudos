The demons' boss. Luckily Master Tiger killed it. That's right. He's right. Chun-kai, come here. They are filmingâ€¦ It's the archdemon. The mother of all demons. So back then Master Tiger defeated the archdemon... -Sir! ...so the settlers could settle down in peace. The same cop is here again. He's brought someone who wants to see Master Tiger. I'll leave him to you. Master Tiger. I want to see Master Tiger. Cheng! Long time no see, mate! How are you doing? Didn't I tell you not to come to me for things like this? I know! But, this scum insists on seeing Master Tiger. What else can I do? He killed his wife and five daughters for no reason. It's all over the media. Everyone in Taiwan is mocking the police. Or, I wouldn't come to you. It's been a long time since I got possessed by Master Tiger. I can't deal with serious cases. What are you doing? Get down! Please, give it a try! He's possessed by a demon. Cheng. You're my only hope! How are you going to deal with it? Fry the demon. What are they talking about? They say they're going to fry the demon tomorrow night. General Psychiatry Thank you, Dr. Yang. You've worked very hard. Allow yourself more time. I'll go get the medicine. How are you doing? I'm okay. Take her out and spend more time with her. Shift her focus to something else. She'll be okay. Eat slowly. There is plenty. It's got into your nose! So disgusting! There is still plenty! Fatty. Give the camera to me. Your hand is dirty! -Look at his face! Chia-hao, time for dinner! What's that? Fatty lends it to me. We're going to take part in a competition. What competition? A Micro Film Competition. If I win, we can go on holiday abroad together! Good Luck! Go eat first. Chia-hao. Your principal called me today. What does he want? It's the 10th anniversary of the music class. They invite me to play in the concert. That sounds good! Chia-hao. Can you call your dad and ask him to come? Dad asks me to give you this. Divorce Agreement Are you sure you want to invite him? I don't want to lose face in public. Hello. -Hello, dad. Chia-hao. The music class 10th anniversary concert in our schoolâ€¦ Can you come? Sure. Is your mom there? I need to talk to her. Hello. Have you read it? Why did you give it to Chia-hao? Every time I sent it to you, you said you didn't get it. What else can I do? I can't let Chia-hao stay with you anymore. He's still young! Don't drag him into this! It's because of you that I'm sick. Tell you what. You carry on with your life. But, I can't live without my son. Mei-ling. Please watch over our son and keep him safe. Bow to Mommy. Come. Daddy, I dreamed of Mommy last night. Why are you so lucky? I've never dreamed of her. Mommy says she misses us very much. She asks you not to forget what you promised her. You really want to film it? Of course! Frying a demon! Record it, quick! Master Tiger, please come down to the Earth! Help me defeat all demons and evil spirits! An urgent order is issued! I can't film anything! Who are you? Why do you want to see Master Tiger? Master Tiger, please come down to the Earth... ...crush all demons! Master... Cheng! Master Tiger failed to possess you again! Hei-gou. Move aside! Record it, quick! This is the demon fried to death just now. Water bottle. No! Come on! Chen worked so hard on his report on the folk culture. Let's watch the film he shot. Actually, from the parapsychological point of view, to be possessed by a spirit is rather common. If the spirit has unfinished business on the Earth, it needs to live in a body like a parasite. The weaker the mind one has, the easier to be possessed. What? I'm going to submit it to the competition. I'll beat you! Some will be affected by the spirit. Then they may tremble or vomit. If you let the spirit get into your consciousness it'll control your behavior. then you're possessed. We often find animals and birds or even dolls being possessed. Daddy. It's so yummy! How is it? It should be okay. Let me taste it. -Okay. It's too sweet! Isn't red bean soup supposed to be sweet? I'm pregnant! I can't eat something so sweet! I'm sorry. Let me do it. Let it simmer a bit longer. My darling baby. Mommy is cooking red bean soup... This is the dream I had. A very scary dream. A monster is eating a tiger by the lake. Daddy is here. Don't be afraid. Mom. Can you see that it's tidier? You tidied it up? Well... I asked Fatty to help me. And, I even found this. What's it? A Mother's Day present. You never wear it. Do you want to keep these? What are they? No, no need to keep them. You're making a film for the competition? Yes. We're making a film about a fish. Why didn't I notice this fish before? It's new? Fatty gave it to me. Daddy! Cheng! Cheng! Cheng! Cheng! What on earth did you do to Hung on the day you fried the demon? He's vanished into thin air! Both of the guards got possessed. If that demon is set free, I've no idea what sort of trouble he'd cause! This is Hung Wen-hsiung's house. He killed them all in here. See if you could find any clues? Phoenix is hung in the south. Trees are planted in the east. Crystals are placed in the southwest. The family looked very happy. How could Hung Wen-hsiung be so brutal? Is it really the demon's doing? They all died upstairs. In this room. What do you think? They followed a feng shui master's instructions. The house helped them accumulate wealth but also trapped spirits inside. The whole family were strange. When his wife was being attacked, she didn't call the police. She called a feng shui master instead. Don't you think it's really strange? It's used to expel evil spirits. Hung had been followed for a while. By the demon? Mom. Why did you put dad's stuff back? It wasn't me! It wasn't me! The feng shui master has retired and moved back to the mountains. It's her great granddaughter who lives here. She's very cooperative. However, when she answers our questions, she uses so much jargon of your profession. I can't understand her. Sorry for bothering you again. My great grandmother has retired and moved back to the mountains. None of us has managed to contact her. But I promise you that she'd never cast any harmful spells. She often told me that some spells are better left unused. How did she help the Hung family arrange the house? I've no idea. But, she left some papers here. Thanks. On the day the tragedy happened, Hung's wife called you. Can you describe the call to him? Hello. Is Mamu there? Mamu? She's moved back to the mountains. She's retired. I'm Hung Wen-hsiung's wife. My husband is possessed! But, we don't run the business anymore. That's all I know. Please don't keep coming back to me. My daughter will be born soon. I'm sorry. Wait. From the fates my great grandmother wrote, did you spot any problems? There were more than five children in the family. There should be a boy who had a very troubled fate. It's over there. Someone often brings offering here. Cheng. Rare disease Medical records Son of Hung Wen-hsiung Mom. I think you should go to see Dr. Yang again. Every time I see her, I feel that I'm a mad woman who can't look after you. Those things. It really wasn't me. I don't know how that happened either. Chia-hao. You have to believe Mommy. Mom. It's okay. I'll come with you. I'll always keep you company. Huang Ya-hui. Chia-hao. Do you like the present? Auntie brought it back from Japan. Thank you, auntie. You're welcome. Glad that you like it. Auntie, your belly is so big! Bigger than mine. Of course! There is a baby inside! I haven't seen Chun-kai for a while. He must have grown taller? If Mei-ling could see it, she'd be very happy. I know it's hard to raise a child on your own. But, you know, life goes on. Hey, maâ€™am! What are you doing? A-di. I called the boy A-di. What's your relationship with the Hung family? Why did you come here? I was the midwife when A-di was born. He was born with a rare disease. When Mrs. Hung saw him, she didn't even dare to hold him. Mr. Hung was too proud. He was afraid of losing face so he locked the child in this room. The child had been locked up for more than ten years. His condition never improved. Mr. Hung was getting more and more desperate and violent. -Sir, listen to me. Sir. None of your business! Sir. Sir, listen to me! Please don't be like this, sir! You want me to lose face? How dare you! How dare you want to go out? You're a freak and you want to go out? I'm just an old woman. How could I rescue him? Is he dead? I'm not sure. I never saw him again after that evening. A-di. Mom. Why didn't you turn the light on? Mom, what happened? Chia-hao. You're happier when you're with dad and auntie, right? You can be honest with me. You're happier when you're with them, right? Can you stop saying that? Tell me the truth! Yes, because you're behaving like this every day! Since dad wants to divorce you, you're behaving like this every day! You're behaving like this every day! Huang Ya-hui. This fish... I found it on the day you fried the demon. Who are you? What's your purpose? Hung Wen-hsiung is possessed. Does the fish taste nice? You monster! -I want to go out! You're not my son! Is my mother okay now? Give me the charm. Chia-hao. Keep this charm with you. Come back to me if anything happens to your mother. It's not an ordinary demon. This is all I can do for you now. I have to go to the mountains to sort it out. Look after your mother for now. Master Tiger has descended. Listen, the boy of the Hung family. If you've any request, please show yourself. Master Tiger will seek justice for you. Your humble servant is pleading with Master Tiger to come save the innocent with us. Cheng, how did you know he was here? Lantan has always been the demons' territory. A-di was alive when he was buried. The demons used the grudge he bore to turn him into a demon. I think they must have got other purposes. Scripture is burned and turned into the rivers and the sea. Light strikes and the sky cracks. A powerful spell settles the fate of the world. An urgent order is issued to the divine guards! Welcome to Hsin-hsien Elementary School concert. We're honored to invite an outstanding alumna, the pianist Huang Ya-hui, to play for us as a special guest. Chia-hao, where is your dad?

Do you remember when was the last time you'd knelt for as long as you've been doing now? It was when Chun-kai's mother was in the hospital. Then do you still remember what I said to you? Mr. Lin. The cancer is spreading fast in your wife's body. I'm very sorry. Under such circumstances, we can save either the mother or the child.

God leaves you when your mind is obsessed. Your mind is full of obsessions, how can Master Tiger enter your body? The statue is made of wood. It just reminds us that God is with us. But, the place where God stays is our hearts. Daddy, don't go! You had the nightmare again. Don't go! It's very dangerous! Daddy knows it's very dangerous. But, if daddy doesn't go, all of us will be in danger. Then, take me with you. I'll protect you. You keep grandpa company. Daddy promises you. I'll come back. Wait... Please... Please, take me with you to save my mother! The demon has caught my mother. She's all I have! Please, take me with you to find her!
