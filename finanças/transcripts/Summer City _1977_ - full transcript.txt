(MultiCom jingle) (chugging of train) (gunshots) - [Man] Social intolerance and misunderstanding are the perfect partners in the trial facing the court. Are we to judge the prisoner purely on his actions or his motives? Is he guilty through provocation or impulse? (lazy music) (radio plays) (car horn honks) - Hey! They don't like it, do they? You're still away. - It's just not right. I still feel guilty being homesick. - Feels alright to me. - Don't judge me. You know what I'm... - Hey, who's joking? I'm deadly serious. Look, I really do fancy you. - Well I like you too, but you know what's happening this week. - So what? It's all the more reason for you to enjoy the last few nights. Look, life's too short. You gotta do it, Nina. (knocking) - Hey, Boo. I need a favor. I got two girls going bowling tonight. - That's alright, that's alright. It's just Dodd being nosey. He can't see anything. - Listen, I got Gloria over here in the car and she wants to say hello to ya. - Yeah? Well you tell Gloria, "Hi" for me, huh? But some other time. - Is that the message? - Look, mate, I'm a bit tied up. (laughing) - I know what you mean. Listen, ring you tomorrow, buddy. See ya later. Bye. - Don't you dare tell anyone about tonight. - Well I shan't. Anyway. What's to tell? Just a friendly last trip. - Don't be like that, Boo. Can you take me home, please? - I can. - [Radio Host] And don't forget: Willie Nelson, the Everley Brothers, and the fabulous Beach Boys will be doing concerts all over Australia starting next week at the Stadium. Now to win two free tickets to this great concert, I want you to tell me who was the movie star who also has the hit record for Bye, Cruel World, (Boo and Nina moan) You got that one right? Who is the movie star with the second record, Bye, Cruel World. Now here is a brand new record that's starting to rave in the American charts, particularly billboard.

I'm not eating at this slophouse. - Slophouse! This is-- - [Boo] I'd like it, but the service was a problem! - Don't you speak to me like that! And don't come back! - Well fair enough. You boys show me ladies like that, and I'll be glad to get married anytime. Hey, imagine being married to a scrubber like that, Boo? You're not careful, you'll find yourself married to one like that. Boo's a little burger bar with a peddle to his little burger's feet everywhere. (boys laugh) - You're right, Sandy, you're a comedian. I didn't know you were a comedian. What're being a comedian for? Or that you're getting married? That's funny, yeah. Yeah, that's funny. (Boo laughing) (surf rock music) (engine sputtering) (boys yelling) (tires screeching) - [Sandy] Oh, you nearly wiped us out, you bastard. Aww shit, here he comes. - [Scollop] Look at the bloody size of him. - Don't let him in! - What the bloody hell do you think you're doing!? A bloody man could've been killed out there! - We nearly did, just up the road, mate. - You think it's a bloody joke, do ya punk? Get outta the car, son. (ignition sputtering) Outta the car! You, out, come on. Out. - Okay. - Right. - What the hell's he doing out there? The tires! Hey, what you doing, grandad!? - Get out or I'll fill it full of bloody knuckle. Can't start the bloody thing, eh? Bugger, these tires crack me up. (laughing) (engine revving) I got your bloody number! (engine roaring) (surf rock music) (silly music) - Leave us alone, alright? - Yeah. - Step aside, boys. I'll handle this. - You're the little mag with all the lip, eh? (Boo laughs) shit! (boys laugh) (blues music) - Bloody son of a bitch. When I get my hands on that... - Hey, weren't you supposed to change the seat last week? Sometimes you can't trust a man. See the radiator, Sandy? - Get us a beer, then? (folksy guitar music) (soft country music) (dogs barking) - [Boo] Where's all these red hot birds you was telling us about? - [Robbie] We'll find 'em, we'll find 'em - [Boo] They must've heard you were coming. - [Scollop] Hey, what's this here? - [Robbie] Quick, the curb! - [sandy] Red alert, mate. Red alert! - [Boo] Looks alright, too. Well hi, birdie. We thought you might know about what a bunch of nice guys can do around here. - We make our own fun. - Oh. - Who's to know in our age standard. - No route, no ride, eh? - Don't take me home. - What's your name, sweetie. - See you tonight, Caroline. 7:30. - And look, you better stop following me and leave me. You know, my father wouldn't like it? - Hey, that's a coincidence. We're all looking for a place to crash. Alright sweetie, you run along. I'll see you later. (Boo laughs) - Ya bombed out, mate. - Hey Robbie, I think she fancies me, mate. That's what I like, a challenge, mate. Yeah, some might get me too offended. - Cheers. - Yeah, cheers. - Think we better get some stubbies, too, for the trip. Can we have a couple dozen stubbies? - Couple dozen stubbies? Yeah. - Thanks a lot, mate. - It's about time, mate. What's happening boys? What's the story? - [Boo] You got any daughters in there, man? (laughing) (extreme crosstalk) (mumbling) - Yeah, you're a wally. Why don't you go to the car instead? - [Boo] Any money on you? - Yeah, mate. - [Boo] Oh, here you go.

Bobby Woods. - Joe Matthews. - Oh, listen Mr. Matthews, we were wondering if we could (mumbling) (dogs barking) - Five overnight, two (mumbles) for facilities. - This mate will sleep in the shit house it'll be cheaper. (laughing) Bloody hillbillies, you're all the same. - [Bobby] We were wondering if we could sleep on the grounds here. - For overnight, (mumbling). - [Sandy] Where would you like us to park? - Well, you mind showing us around sir? (dogs barking) - There's that Caroline bird, Caroline, mate. That's unreal, no? Hey, you know when we picked her, you know when we met her down the street, had R double oh two written all over her face. Top one, really, top bird. She has to be the best bit of gear in the bay. Hey, she's gonna have to get the pigs. - Oh. (laughing) - [Boo] Legs right up to her bum, mate. I tell you man, she turns up a good thing, tonight I'll be in there like Flynn. - [Scollop] You reckon? - [Boo] Yeah, before curfew's over here tonight I'll be in that, mate. Smile, man, it's got it written all over it's face. I'll bet you a quid, mate, I'm in that before 10 o'clock. Wanna take me on? - You're on. - Here it goes again, mate. - [Mr. Matthews] Keep away from those laddigans. See ya later. - I just can't wait for tonight, man. - [Scollop] How was Gloria the other night? - Six outta 10. - [Scollop] For real? - Yeah, nothin', nothin' we had this whirl, mate, but that, that. - Boo, he's like that all the time. Don't let him get atcha. - Well that's just it. Let's sleep in the shit house. No finesse, no thought. Not working, Rob. Think I should go now. Appreciate this. - Why ruin a good weekend? - Okay, alright, alright. I'm not going to the dance, I'm not in the mood. - You were upset that I scored Gloria, aren't ya? You are. You dog, you're batteries over a bird. I never thought I'd see the day, mate. But Gloria? Did you have her staked out mate? Aw, listen man, she's always been just one of the girls right? How long we known her? Two years, right? Right? If I'd known you had her staked out, mate, I wouldn'ta gone near her. That's the gospel, right? You believe me? I would not have touched her. If I'd known that you had her staked out, I wouldn'ta gone near her with a bloody barge pole. - I believe you. - Yeah, you look like you believe me too. - I do. - Listen mate, the dance is on tonight, if she's got a sister, we'll both be in, I promise ya, right? (laughing) Get the old routine, mate (chuckling). Now listen, bullshit about Gloria, right? - Hey Boo, lay off Sandy, right? Lay off Sandy. - What's the story. - I'm trying to get him away for a weekend, and what we agreed to in the beginning, get in a good time. You're ridin' him, mate. - He's been whinging since we started, right? Mate? - Just lay off him, mate. (extreme crosstalk) - Let's have a good time. - Yeah, yeah, right, right. (dramatic 70s rock music) (upbeat swing music) (party commotion) - [Man] Wrote a presentation? - [Boo] You hear that inside, man? - If that opens I can go in, right? - Listen, the accents they go for alright, you gotta go in (mumbling) alright? - [Bouncer] Hey, take him in. - Hey mate, come on. - [Bouncer] Hey, blue shirt! Come on. Come on. Nice try. And your seeing eye dog, come on. Good game. (clanging of coins) (laughing) (mumbling) - Plenty of good looking (mumbles) here, right? - Oh yeah, what are we on that one? - That's my little sister (mumbling). - Hey there's a chick with her tongue in her throat, am I right? (mumbling) - Yeah, right. (Scollop mumbling) She's alright, yeah. That blond one there, mate. (boys mumbling) - Well (mumbling) are you enjoyin' yourselves tonight? (crowd cheering) That's the way it should be. Now, you know when you came through the door tonight, you got tickets, right? Now this is our door prize for ya, and this happens to be for two tickets to go along next Wednesday night for the all teen shake, specifically to see the Great Crash (mumbles). (crowd cheering) I thought you'd like that, good prize. And I now wanna get into something I think that these guys have been doing such a marvelous job. These guys are here at work, I've seen them work around the place, and they are The Marshall Brothers. Let's put our hands together (crowd cheering). Okay. And the guys and I thought we have to do this number tonight, because it's actually success and if all these guys down low, wherever we do the dances, and they're great now, "Johnny B. Goode"! (audience cheering) ("Johnny B.

(playful shrieking) - It's cold! - [Boo] Hey what a view! it's beautiful. - What are you doing? - Is it good? (water splashing) I forgot to ask you, can you swim? - Of course I can swim. - [Boo] Isn't that good? (giggling) - It's really nice! - [Boo] Hey! - Yeah? - [Boo] Someone told me at the dance there's snakes in here. - What? I'm getting out! No, no, no. - No, baby. Stay. - No! No. - It's alright. Mascara. - Seen anything of Caroline? - No, I haven't, no. (heavy breathing) - It's alright, isn't it? - Boo! (mumbling) (ominous rumblings) (waves crashing ashore) (birds chirping) - [Boo] I can't see you tomorrow, baby. I've got things to do, you know? We'll be leaving tomorrow. I tell you what. Next time I come back, we'll do it right, okay? - [Caroline] Boo. - [Boo] Come on, baby. Your old man'll be waiting up for ya. You gotta go now. - [Caroline] Aren't you going to take me home? - [Boo] Yeah, what if your old man's up and sees me, eh? There'll be hell to pay, right? - [Caroline] Boo? Boo. You still love me, don't you? - [Boo] 'Course I do. Come on quick, I gotta go. (ominous music) (waves crashing ashore) (ominous music) (waves crashing ashore) (upbeat jazzy music) - G'day out there today. - Looks really good. Really like the sea. - Almost everyone I know likes the sea. - I suspect you're right. You seem to be part of it though. What is it you like about surfing? - I don't know. It's hard to say. Well, if you could ride yourself, you'd know why. - [Sandy] Just a sport. - Ah, no, no. It's more than just a sport, mate. Might sound stupid, but more a way of life, I suppose. Say, if you've got any problems or worries or anything like that you just, there's the place to go. Or just take 'em all out there and thrash it out on the waves. - Where's the future in it? Out there for hours and hours, in the water, out of the water. Nowhere to go. - That's right. There's no where to go. It's all there already. - Yeah, where is the security in surfing for the rest of your life? What would you be doing in 10 years time? - I'll be doing something in 10 years time. So I guess in 10 years time, that's what I'll be doing. (upbeat surf rock) ♫ Well it's early in the morning ♫ And it's time to make a start ♫ And I put my poly surfboard on the rack upon my car ♫ I head down to the surf ♫ I read the waves are really fine ♫ I'm gonna catch a mountain but I won't go down ♫ You gotta walk the plank ♫ Ride the hook ♫ Caught it left and right and keep it nice and tight ♫ And now the tide is drawing near ♫ You're moving down the wall ♫ Now steady as she goes you got your toes upon the nose ♫ And now you're hanging right ♫ Hanging right ♫ Oh come to Malibu ♫ And now you hit the beach ♫ And you're feeling mighty fine ♫ You turn your board around for the second time ♫ You make it out the back ♫ Swells are comin' back ♫ The first ones are too small ♫ And so you take a latch ♫ You gotta walk the plank ♫ Ride the hook ♫ Going left and right and keep it nice and tight ♫ And now the time is drawing near ♫ You're movin' down the wall ♫ Steady as she goes, you got your toes up on the nose ♫ So now you're hangin' fine ♫ Hangin' by shores upon the Malibu ♫ Let's go ♫ And when the day is over ♫ And all of the sudden you think ♫ You're going out to the surf club ♫ To dance and start the paces ♫ And when the night is through (birds chirping ominously) ♫ You hear the fellas say ♫ Don't forget tomorrow you got another day ♫ You gotta walk the plank ♫ Ride the hook ♫ Caught it left and right and keep it nice and tight ♫ And now the time is drawing near ♫ You're movin' down the wall ♫ Now steady as she goes ♫ You got your toes up on the nose ♫ You're hangin' by ♫ Hangin' by-- - Out of towners, eh? Toms, and Caveman. - How ya goin? - G'day, g'day. - Listen, you mind if we borrow the wax 'cause numb skull forgot it. - Sure. - Pick it up. - Not really working that good today, but anytime you come in it's usually 10 feet. No trouble through the pier, I'd say 10 foot all along here left and right flakes. No trouble at all. Best surf on the coast. - Shut it, will ya? Wax your board up, will ya? We usually got a good break there early in the morning, you know, it's not bad. Just weave the (mumbles) out there in the (mumbles) you know? You come here much? Alright. Hey! Anyway, going out? Okay! (surf breaking loudly) (slow surf music) - [Radio Host] Ah, what a sound, that really stokes me. Well, gang, we gotta wrap it up. Look out for yourselves out there, and remember a rickapootie and a bandooglie! (bar commotion) (laughing) (mumbling conversation) - My ID? You're mack little pal. (extreme crosstalk) I'm not the proud type. (extreme crosstalk and mumbling) - [Boo] Got any more on you, mate? - I have if you got it. (mumbling) Pullin' the slip again, yeah. - Get a shot for the groupie or what? (extreme crosstalk and mumbling) (sad music) - [Caroline] Hey, hey! You're Boo's friend, aren't you? - [Sandy] Yes. - [Caroline] Do you know where he is? - Why? - I've got a problem. - What are you trying to say? What are you trying to say (mumbles)? (crying) Oh, God. (crying) Do you realize that what you've done, you're in for fear of of the thing that you've done to yourself. How old are you? You don't even know the man. I mean, you met this boy once. You're 15, you don't know the meaning of the word love yet. And you just give yourself away, you just gave yourself away. - [Caroline] It wasn't that bad, he said he loved me. - [Sandy] How could he say he loved you, do you love him? How can you love somebody you only met him once. My god, just threw, completely threw something that's sacred, just threw it out the door. For what? For some fool who you met once? What if you are pregnant? What, in this town, what is it gonna say? This town? (bar commotion) - Four beers please. (bar commotion) Hey, baby. Mind if I join you for a while? I couldn't leave without speaking to one of the more lovely locals. You've got a lovely pair of... Hands. So I go with-- - You make me sick. I've read better lines in magazines. You're only a boy, what the hell do you know? - Well. See you later. - Naw, wait a minute. - (mumbling) Maybe you'll listen to me. No one in the rest of the this bloody town does. Leave him. - Who is he? - My husband. Don't. Doing good. Anyway, I wanna ask you what you did with that poor bitch Caroline. Poor love, she's probably suffering hell. You're only the start of her troubles. - How? - What it is you don't know is this is a small town. Jack the milk man saw you and her up at the water tower. And Marge Bowman saw her coming home very upset. The break times better than any newspaper. - She wanted it. I made her happy. - You think so? What you'd have thought. Come on. (mumbling softly) - Who is Boo? Boo doesn't love you. Boo loves Boo. (sniffling) Listen, what if you're pregnant? (crying) The whole town'll know. They'll think you're a whore. Look, you gotta tell your father. Tell your father. - I can't tell him! - You've got to tell your father! - I can't! I can't tell him! - I guess they ostracize the bullies. And I got married, I never thought I would. - Could. Met a girl at school once, I'll tell ya, I was so wrapped up with her, it was love or whatever they call it. The real thing, just like in the movies. Anyway, the more I did for her, and I showed her some really good times, the more she came to expect. So when I ran out of the good times, then one night, when she was supposed to be at the movies with her girlfriend, she was out driving with one of me best mates. I would never have found out if they hadn't smashed and killed themselves. - I'm sorry. That's tough. - No, that's alright. (bar commotion) (sad music) (crickets chirping) (horns honking) - [Scollop] You never told me how you made out with Caroline the other night. How was she, hey? - Tight like a mouse's ear. (chuckling) - A bit young wasn't she? A bit dangerous forcing a young girl-- - I didn't force her. I just (mumbles) a vibe, that's all. (crickets chirping) (rumbling of engine) (ominous music) (clock ticking) - You didn't go to church today. You're tired? Enjoy the dance last night? - [Caroline] It was alright. - What time did you get in last night? Or this morning? It was this morning, wasn't it? (ominous music) (clock ticking) (plate shattering) (shrieking) - Wasn't my fault! I didn't want to do it! - I want to know his name. Who was he? - I don't know! - What was his name? - I don't know. - You don't know his name? You get into all kinds of trouble, and you don't even know his name. (ominous music) (clock ticking) (sobbing) (screaming) Darling, darling, I know, I know. (mumbles) You must know his name. You must know who he was. What's his name? - I don't (mumbling) daddy. - No darling, I know you don't wanna hurt me. Who was he? What's his name? Who was he? - Boo is his name. - One of those fellows who came here last night? The smart one? (ominous music) (Caroline sniffling) (ominous music) (boys mumbling) - [Scollop] Well, wasn't there a sign? - [Robbie] Must've blown down, this isn't right. - If you're going 30 miles down a dirt track in the middle of nowhere, you wanna be bloody sure it's the right way. - Listen. If you wanna get out, there's the door, alright? - [Robbie] Cut it out here, you miserable lot. Let's get the beer and have a good time! - Last fling. Wanna be the last. - Yeah, this wedding's really got you screwed up, huh? I'm never getting married, that I'll tell ya. - Depends on the girl. - Look, what kind of girl? - The kind you can trust. - Trust? Listen, if you want my advice, you'll call it off. - Now why should I take your advice? - [Robbie] 'Cause he's been with every chick around. - Alright, well there might be one or two eventually out there. - Alright, Boo, cut it out. - You gotta great chick back there, Sandy. - Yeah, we all think so, don't we fellas? (laughing) Yeah, yeah there's two kinds. The kind you marry and the kind you-- (laughing) (wheels screeching) (boys mumbling) (sighing) - Come on here, boys, give us a hand. - How far is the beach from here? - Can't you think of anything except for surf and sex? None of ya's know where we are. Nearly kill me. - [Robbie] The axle's ratchet. We'll be here for the night. Come on Sandy. (ominous music) (crickets chirping) - The car's stuck. Look mate, I've had it with this. Great weekend. Sleeping on the ground. And a whinger. Robbie shouldn'ta brought him. He's up himself. Mopin' about that stupid chick. What the hell's he see in her anyway? (birds loudly trilling) (mumbling) (Robbie drowned out by birds and crickets) - Enjoy yourself. After next week, things'll be different. It'll be all over for ya, mate. - You mean the marriage? Christ, hasn't it occurred to you yet that that's what I want? - Sure, mate. But everyone has their last fling. - Why? For you and them back there. I've outgrown that (mumbles). And when you grow up, you will too. - Grow up? If growing up means settling down with one person for the rest of your life, I don't wanna know about it. - Who's the lady Robbie? The one you can trust? (laughing) What've I told you, mate? You can't trust any of them. They're all the same. Donna's no different from any of them. One man woman. What a joke. It all depends on who you're with at the time. - I thought she seemed like the faithful kind. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? Who do reckon I was with at the carpark last Thursday night? The night you came to the window. - Oh, wow. (laughing) You and Donna in a car park?
