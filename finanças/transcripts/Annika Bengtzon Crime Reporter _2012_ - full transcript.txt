Halt. Halt. You've had enough tonight, Benny. I won't let the law dictate to me. I'll call a taxi for you. No, I'll walk. A journalist up north was in a hit and run last night. The police think it was intentional. Is he dead? As a door nail. I want details about the investigation. Motive, and the background on the spot. The opinion on his work place and the like. Benny was quite a... Benny? Benny Ekland? Did you know him? We discussed the Nazi case. He was a good journalist. In Luleå? Didn't he write about F21? That bombing. That was 40 years ago. It was terrorism. A young soldier was killed. That was in the dim past. Berit, can you? No, I do the ancient scandals. Okay. Bengtzon? I'm going back. Take the first flight to Luleå. Don't forget your winter clothing. Now you'll miss the fun Friday. I quit that. Did you know Big Ben? Big Ben? That's what we called him. I spoke to him on the phone about the motorcycle gang, but I never met him. Why do the police think it's murder? Don't know. He was widely known here. Not necessarily in a positive way. What he wrote didn't please everyone. What did he write about? Everything. From poachers to the salaries of the top public officials. And a piece commemorating the terrorist attack on F21. He often wrote about F21, right? He could never let go. But Wednesday he came in and said he had new information. What kind of information? No idea. Didn't you ask? No, I didn't. It was a bit like... Benny was obsessed. He refused to believe the official story. Is there someone I can talk to? Did he have any family? Yes, his sister at the factory. The factory? The ironworks. I'll let Hans Blomgren of the archive help you. Benny was a stubborn guy. Produced more than anyone else. Do you know the type? Yes. This must be difficult for you. Does anyone have any suspicions about the facts? No. Star Reporter. Darling of the editor. The union didn't like him. He said often, "Use the by-line with my photo. I've surpassed myself." Did he have enemies? What do you think? So, Miss Stockholm. What can I do for you? Only what can't be found on-line. And what you have on the F21 attack. F21. F21. You probably weren't even born then. Please, Mr. Blomgren... I'm married and have two children. Here it is. You feminists. So you're not a feminist? Sorry? Nothing. Please. Thank you. Police Luleå. Annika Bengtzon, "Evening Press". Can I speak to Commissioner Sup? It's Suup, a Saami name. He isn't there. When is he coming back? I don't know, I'm sorry. I'll try later. Thank you. I knew eventually someone would lose control. Given everything he was digging into. He was a troublemaker, my brother. Always. And he had a terrible temper. Could never keep his mouth shut. Did he have a relationship? No one was ever longer than a month with him. He was like a cat on the prowl. Who do you think could have done it? The question is who didn't do it. But deep down inside he was a good guy. So he came back to help our old mom and dad. And he always brought gifts for years when my children were small. They loved him. I can't believe he's gone. Linus, hello. Annika Bengtzon, "Evening Press". Do you have some time for me? No. You're done. No. My mother will be here soon. Did you know Benny? The man who was run over. I don't want to talk to you. I won't use your name. You can remain anonymous. You mustn't tell my mother. She works at night. She doesn't know I was out late. What were you doing? Playing video games. She's worried about everything. I saw Benny... on my way home last night. He was drunk. A parked car suddenly started up and drove into him. Right into him. Then drove back over him and went away. And you saw that. Did you recognize the driver? Linus, did you tell the cops? You should go now. Is that your mother? I'd like... No, you promised. Who's that? Nobody. Nobody? What were you talking about? Just things about the team. Hello? Have you read it? There's one on Benny's work... One on his last day and the interview with his sister. What do the police say? I haven't talked with them. When are you coming back? I want to stay another night. What for? I still have to talk to the police and F21. Okay, do it. I also have a witness. What? A 15-year-old who saw what happened. Why didn't you say immediately? Can we publish it? Can we put it? Yes, maybe. Great... Take it further. Keep me informed. See ya. My mitten. My mitten's gone. Papa. I hear you. Hey, how are you? Ellen's lost a mitten. There's a hole in her pocket. Look in the lining. I will. Where are you? In Luleå, until tomorrow. You can't just leave the city. I know, I'm sorry. Don't be angry. I'm not. And I'll read your story tonight. Dad, I'm hungry. My mitten. I'm hungry too. Annika, I can't talk now. Love you. Talk to you later. Dad, are we going now? Yes, we're going home. He had a big mouth. Especially if he'd been drinking. What was he talking about? Nothing went over Big Ben's head. He had all the answers. But if you spoke against him, he'd strike out like a cobra. Anything else? No, thank you. 15-YEAR-OLD WITNESSED THE MURDER There isn't much that hasn't been released. I can tell you what our investigation revealed. Forty years ago? Exactly. I read Benny Ekland's articles about the attack. He wrote that size 36 shoe prints were found on the spot. True? Yes. And this wasn't the only sabotage? The gate wasn't too secure. You could simply just sneak in. Benny's articles are best taken with a grain of salt. You concluded the Russians were the culprits. Why? A process of elimination. Weren't several leftist groups suspected? Yes, but none was capable of launching such an attack. No left or right faction. So Russian spies with tiny shoe sizes? You can say that. They existed. And believe it or not, they still exist. Anything else? Benny wrote a commemorative article. Did he talk to you? I haven't seen Benny for years. Was that all? Yes. Annika Bengtzon? Hi. Alexander Suup, detective. Linus Gustafsson called me. Oh, good. We'll see him today. He says you told him to contact us. Benny's mail. You wanted it? Give it to my colleague. So you don't need it? No, thank you. Shall we have a talk? A talk? So my father always said. We appreciate your assistance. Well done. You work smoothly. I just spoke to Pettersson of F21 and heard you were there. I have something I want to release, but the military base is against it. So you can expect a fuss. Excuse me, but we found something. Let's see, what is it? There was a letter today at Benny's. "No construction without destruction. This means criticism, and thus revolution." Sounds like our police. Check it out. Excuse me, are you done here? Not really. I'll come back. Do you have something? I'm not sure yet. The police and military identified a suspect for the F21-attack long ago. A fellow townsman. I told Benny a few days before his death. Why do you suspect that man? He disappeared the next day. And... Do you have a name? His code name was Ragnwald. Extreme leftist groups often use code names. We know the leader's name was Ragnwald. Do you know his real name? No. Do you think Benny knew? Who knows. Do you know any other members? It's a small, contained movement. After the attack, they seemed to disperse and Ragnwald left the country. Why did they blame the Russians? The army needed more money. A young soldier came from the local regiment. And maybe was embarrassed because they were proven to be so vulnerable. Why are you telling me this? Do you think there's a connection to Benny's murder? I think he was onto something. But many people here hated him. Let's hear it. Commissioner Suup heads the investigation. He's apparently Saami. He gave me some interesting information. Such as? Something he had just told Benny. I was at F21 today and they lied flat out to me. They claim the Russians were responsible, but Suup says it was a leftist group. Led by a man code named Ragnwald. Whatever. What about the witness? Linus has talked to the police now. I wanna stay one more night. One more night? Is it worth it? I think so. Well, depends what you discover. All right then. No trace of killer Annika Bengtzon. The police. Commissioner Suup wants you to stop by. Annika Bengtzon for the Commissioner. I'll call him. Annika Bengtzon's here for Commissioner Suup. Okay, thanks. What was that? Linus was killed. She found him this morning when she came home from work. Damn. We talked with Linus' teachers and classmates. The school's in mourning. Flags at half mast. The photo archive of the 'Norrlandskuriren? I will call their editor. Okay. Annika, stay here. Why didn't you talk to the mother first? You know the rules. Maybe someone else will have to take over. The least I can do for him is write about it. Where are you going? I've an appointment at the Justice Ministry. Have you had time to read my report? The report. Oh, yes. I think you should explain what the politicians should do. Give concrete examples. This hunt will only scare them. Thank you. I don't think it's too late. Kisses. I'll have some of that. So, what did you think? Overall it's good. We can advise them specifically. They're scared it will have the opposite effect. What do you think? I've just looked at... Sorry. Thomas. Thomas, Cramne. Something happened, and I've no time for our appointment. I understand. No, no problem. Then we do it another time. That's okay. Okay then. Goodbye. Cramne is unavailable. Why don't we have a bite and discuss the report? You're right about those lesser points. And we can resolve them. You ordered the excellent porterhouse steak. Thank you. Thank you. A week later he came to live with me. But he is getting older. Is there a big age difference? Bon appetit. Thank you. Some more wine, please. Another bottle of the same? Sure. You got it. Almost 20 years. But you begin to notice he's older. He is constantly shedding. Shedding? And he sprays. I had him castrated long ago, but... Wait, I'll try to show you. Here. My life partner. Socks. Socks. Isn't he cute? Very funny. And you? Are you married? Yes. Her name's Annika. A journalist. They are often... aggressive. Yes, now and then. Annika's like a stubborn pit bull. Cheers. Cheers. Who was that, Kurt? Who was that on the phone? A chance to get on their own two feet... Dedicate 200 million SEK for training in entrepreneurship... Pathetic. How can she go from anti-Vietnam demonstrations to that? The Minister of Culture? Did you know her? From the same anti-war group. We fought against the powers that be all the time, and expel the U. S. From Vietnam with each tank and gun and bomb. I remember. Was it radical? That's putting it mildly. Now she's a liberal. God knows how that happened. Klas Eklund went from the Marxist-Leninist Student Union to financial manager at SE Banken, so anything can happen, I guess. Can you help me? Yes, what? I think Benny Ekland's murder is related to the attack at F21. The police told him about a local leftist group led by someone called Ragnwald. Just before Benny published that, he was murdered. And two days later, the witness, Linus Gustafsson, was also murdered. There must be a link. And I... The day after the murder, Benny Ekland was sent an anonymous letter. "No construction without destruction. This means criticism, and thus revolution." That's Mao. A quote from Mao. What happened to those leftist groups? Out. Get lost. Culture doesn't obscure elitism. Outside Sweden we see many examples of fruitful interaction between cultures... So they were the rebels? The group in Uppsala were the worst. Members broke all contact with their families. I don't know how many lost hope and committed suicide. It sounds like a crazy cult. Like at Knutby... The rebels were a splinter group of the CFML, that separated from the VPC. Because the VPC was pro-soviet and the others were Maoists. Exactly. The pro-soviets left the VPC and formed the MOT... And the fanatical revolutionaries left CFML and formed CFMLR, and later CP. And the CP is? The Communist Party. That's the reason the leftist movement is known as "alphabet soup". So, in the Norrbotten region. If leftist extremists were behind the bombing in '72... What groups were there? Do we know the names as well? All men. No women? Are we still looking for Ragnwald? I think we'll find someone wearing size 36 shoes. Do you think it's a woman? Why not? Of course. Ulrike Meinhof was a woman. Gudrun Ensslin, Hanna Krabbe. Half the Red Army Faction. See? I think we should look at Kurt Sandström again. Head of the Red Youth in the region. A fan of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. If anyone knows anything, it's him. I'll get in touch with him. The old revolutionary is now member of the Center Party. He sits on the council in Östhammar. I'll call him. Sandström. Annika Bengtzon from "Evening Press". The Evening Press? That's good, I was going to call you. I couldn't muster the strength. Oh, I... The police won't listen to me. I was eager to talk to Kurt. Hello? So you don't know yet? What? Kurt's dead. I can call another time. He was murdered. The police don't believe me. They call it suicide, but it was murder. This was my parents' home. Kurt and I took it over in 1975. How did you meet? At a road club meeting. You know, about the construction of roads, asphalting and the like. Kurt came here in the 70s with the green movement. He found living expenses were better shared. It almost led to riots. So he was a radical in his youth? Like so many of our generation. Did he have any friends from that time? No. I know this is hard, but... How do you know it wasn't suicide? Come. That was my chair. The police have taken the pillows. Are you married? We were married for 40 years. Kurt would never sit in my chair. Let alone shoot himself in it. We were happy. More than ever. Kurt felt at home here. He loved his life. We have no children, but we travelled and we had each other. I told the police, but they wouldn't listen. Did he have any enemies? No. And did you notice anything strange in the last few days? No. Wait, maybe... A letter arrived. Mailed from France. We don't know anybody in France. It came last week. Kurt was agitated a lot about it. Don't know who the sender was? No. But I saw him on the phone. I asked who it was, but he wouldn't say. He seemed scared. That was nothing for him. This morning there was another letter. It was so scary I'm threw it out. "A hurricane, so fast and furious that no power is able to stop." Mao. Two Mao quotations. Two murders followed by Mao quotations. This can't be a coincidence. No. But now there are three deaths. You think that Linus... Do you want me to call? Gustafsson? Hello? Hello. Who is this? Annika Bengtzon. What do you want? To say how terrible I feel. Do you believe in God, Annika Bengtzon? No, not really. I do, and it helps me. I don't know why the Lord called Linus now. But I must accept it. I have to ask you something. After Linus' death did you receive a strange letter? You mean that thing about the youth? What youth? It came yesterday. Do you still have it? Yes. Can you him to read me? Yes. "How can we assess whether a young person is a revolutionary? What do we notice? Only one criterion..." Have you told the police about this? No. You should. Tell Commissioner Suup. I can't talk to you. It must be the same killer. 3,000 SEK? I can get better pictures of my grandmother. I think I'm a serial killer. 500 SEK, not a cent more. Three dead: Benny and Linus Gustafsson in Luleå, and the politician in Östhammar. All three received anonymous letters with Mao quotations. What are you saying? I must see what the police know. Go directly. I'll call for a car. Tell me about the serial killer. What? Funny. Whoever sends Mao quotations. I'm not following you. Benny Ekland, journalist in Luleå. Linus Gustafsson, witnessed Benny's murder. Politician Kurt Sandström. Kurt received a letter with a quote from Mao the day after the murder. Ragnwald is back, huh? Suup showed it to Benny and then to me. You want to know if Ragnwald's back. Do you want to take over the men's room? For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son... One day you'll become too smart for your own good. So you confirm the relationship between them? Yes. And Ragnwald? Is he a suspect? We have no forensic evidence. Who is he? He led a group of extremists. They were known as "Red Wolf". "Red Wolf". Wait. Is it this one? Where did you get that? Kurt Sandström got his the day before his death. Can he have been a member? That's our hypothesis. But you called it suicide. No, the local police did. We knew Sandström was an extremist before and after the attack. It isn't impossible he knew about "Red Wolf". But apart from Ragnwald no other member is known to us. Also no women? Women? The F21 prints were size 36. What man has such small feet? Can Ragnwald be a woman? Ragnwald's real name is Göran Nilsson. Göran Nilsson? Born in 1948. Son of a preacher from Laestadiaanse Saatajärvi in Norrbotten. Studied theology in Uppsala. Worked for a while in the cathedral in Luleå. He disappeared on Nov. 19, 1972, the day after the F21 bombing. So you kept an eye on him? He committed murder for the ETA but probably has French nationality. A real assassin? A real killer. How can you spend 40 years without Interpol, the Mossad, or anyone else finding you? Fly under the radar. No bank accounts. No credit cards. No telephone line. No address. No friends. No family. Plus be good at what you do. But why would he return and commit the murders? That's what we want to know too. You can write that the murders are related, but not that we suspect Ragnwald. The Mao quotations? Keep that a secret. It's confirmed. Beautiful. Beautiful... Start with "Serial killer among us". The dead in Norrbotten, the quotations. I can't do it. It's just how it unfolds. Outline the information properly. Then the murder in Östhammar. Perhaps there's no one else. Describe the desperate hunt for the killer. You'll get the front page, six, seven, eight, nine, and the middle page. And I want to go back to Luleå. I have new information about F21. Take it off and take the first flight tomorrow. And Bengtzon? Good work. I know. Possible serial killer I want to make meringues. Then eat half yourself. Come. We're going the other way. Have you eaten? They're very happy. We've incorporated all your suggestions in it. Everyone's happy. Great. I think I'll have some wine. How was your day? Sensational. What did you say? Nothing. I'd like to speak to Lars Rosen at the Provincial Assembly. Lars Rosen. Leave a message. I'm calling from the "Evening Press", about allegations of excessive expenses. According to my sources your delegate Sophia Grenborg misappropriates excessive expenses for private gain. Do you have any comment? Provincial Assembly. Message for Thomas Samuelsson. Tell him his wife asks if he'll pick up the children today. This is what we had on the extreme left in the '70s. Some pages are missing. People are forgetful. Thanks anyway. Like two drops of water. Who? You and Benny. Just as stubborn. Equally obsessed. His keys. Thank you. "I told you so." What? Benny was buried yesterday. He wanted "I told you so" on his tombstone. Was his wish granted? No. The minister wants to marry Ragnwald. Karina Björnlund wanted to marry a terrorist. You're kidding. She may be involved in the attack. We must proceed cautiously. I'll call Berit back. Annika? If we publish, it must be watertight. Understood? Come back as soon as you can. Berit? Suup. I was at Benny's home. Bengtzon? Somebody was there. What is going on? Someone tried to break in. Calm down. Did you see who it was? No, I... And my car wouldn't start. Where are you now? At the airport. On the way home. I'll check it out. Larsson? What are you doing here? Thomas had a dinner to go to. Weren't you in Luleå? No, the plans changed. Good. So I can go home? Sure. You ought to think more about Thomas. You can always give up your career. What do you know? Everything. I'm his mother. You don't give a damn. What did you say? No, nothing. He needs some encouragement. I'm home now, so you can go. Thanks for your help. Pleasure. Lots of love to the children. And Thomas. Bye. I've left your breakfast in the fridge. Kisses. What are you d... These are all letters sent to the Minister of Culture this month. Can I see the anonymous letter that came from Hendaye on November 11th? This one. Of course. Here. Source: anonymous. Subject: Image of "Red Wolf". Decision: archive. We get a lot like that. Anonymous sender, with all kinds of crazy content. Do you know Göran Nilsson? Do you know him? Ragnwald? Head of "Red Wolf". Do you remember? A terrorist group you belonged to? You planned to marry him. No idea what you mean. I'll write about it. Oh, really? I'd think twice about that if I were you. What do you have to say about Ragnwald? Who do you think you are? If you contact me again, you'll regret it. We know. We know everything we need to know about Karina Björnlund. How long have you known she was in "Red Wolf"? The public should know a minister was engaged to a terrorist. None of this means she was involved in the attack. The F21 footprint could be hers. We want Ragnwald, not Björnlund. Why wasn't he arrested? There was no forensic evidence. No link with the four victims. Mao isn't enough. Four victims? You said "four". You heard me wrong. Bullshit. There is one more death. Then it would be all over the press. Not if it was a woman. And they'd call it household accident. I'm going to work for you. Do you have anything? Three recent deaths at home. A tragic twist of fate. Annelie Husing in Uddevalla... Susanne Franzen in Borås and Margaret Axelsson in Luleå. Luleå? Yes. The husband, Thord, was released for lack of evidence. Do you have the phone number? Annika? I feel we've overlooked something. I'm looking for Thord Axelsson. That's me. I'm Annika Bengtzon... I don't talk to reporters. I know you're innocent. The Mao quotation... Annika. My office, now. There are now four people dead. Ragnwald's name is Göran Nilsson. He was engaged to the Minister of Culture... Annika. I just had a very interesting phone call. Why did you investigate the Provincial Assembly? Damn, Annika. You're abusing your position for personal gain? You're on leave immediately. I have a story to write. Forget the story. You're suspended. Someone in my team was transferred today. Do you have anything to do with it? How long did you know? Does it matter? Why do you react so to Sophia? So this is my fault? You're crazy. If you go now, you won't come back. I know. Hey, listen... Thord Axelsson here. I'm willing to talk with you. Thord... That's wonderful. If... I can't do it on the phone. Your rabbit's in the backpack. I want to go with dad. I know, but he must work. He must always work. Fasten your seat belt. Have a nice day, sweethearts. I don't know what I'd do without Margit. Here's the quote. "Peoples of the earth, unite, and defeat the aggressors from the US." So you knew about that. Do you know more? I know the suspect is called Ragnwald. He led a terrorist group here in Luleå in the '70s, called "Red Wolf". "Red Wolf", yes. It was a Maoist splinter group. They wanted to take the big step. What big step? Use terrorism to force the country to confront its true nature. Simply cause chaos. F21, that was just the first of many planned attacks. You can't write a word until Ragnwald is... arrested. I've two adult daughters. Previously he showed no mercy. He won't this time. So... The stage was covered in blood. She had no chance. I promise. One mistake. She had 40 years of regret. One mistake. Halt. She was forced. Ragnwald was convinced that if Margit committed the attack, it would make the group stronger. But frankly someone else did it. Karina Björnlund? Yes, she was the only one who knew how to get into F21. And how to deal with the explosives. Her father worked there. So she backed out. Ragnwald was furious. Ragnwald was furious. He forced Margit to place the bomb... for the solidarity of the group and to demonstrate his authority. But the group fell apart under the weight of what happened. Why did Ragnwald kill Margit? She refused to go to the meeting. What meeting? Ragnwald sent a letter. "Red Wolf". It was the sign for everyone to get together. On the anniversary of the bombing. She wanted to forget it all. She was terrified of him. The anniversary is today? That is correct. Do you know where the meeting is? No, I don't know. Björnlund. Annika Bengtzon here. I haven't anything to say. But... Kallax Airport. I must pick up someone. Has the flight from Stockholm landed? No, delayed until 18:30. Great, thank you. Say what you have to say. I can stay here. Luleå Police. Commissioner Suup. Who's calling? Annika Bengtzon for the Commissioner. He's not here. Listen, I'm at the ironworks. Göran Nilsson and Karina Björnlund are here. Do you have the address? The iron foundry. I see a brick building and icebreakers. I'll let Suup know. Hello? Hello? Hello. Annika here. I can't hear you. Hello? Don't you make the connection? What are you doing here? As I said, you're just like him. Like Benny. What is she doing here? She just wanted to call the police. Do you realize what risks I've taken? Shut up! That goes for you too, nosy bitch. I never dreamed you'd return. But here you are. I've waited so long. We haven't met here for a long time. "Red Wolf". "Red Wolf", exactly. Why are you armed? You're so impatient, Karina. You never used to be. I want to know why I'm here. The power went to her head. She's ruined. But you can trust me. I am ready for battle. I'm sick. I can die anytime. No, you're not dying. I've got cancer. Doed he look sick to you? Does he look sick? Answer the question. Why did you murder Kurt and Margit who did everything? It wasn't me. Right, Hans? They had lost the faith. They didn't want to come. You're crazy. I'm leaving. No, you stay. You betrayed us then and now. Shut up. I've done something in my life. I punished the traitors. You sick bastard. Linus was only 15. What had he done wrong? It's war. In war there are casualties. We're fully operational. Fully operational. I await your orders. This blood money I've earned all over the world. Spain, France, Africa. I've slain people for money. That's why God gave me cancer. God? I've betrayed my god. I have one last request. Give this money to the church in Laestadiaanse. After 40 years you talk about God? There is forgiveness, Hans. Do you think God cares about us? Control yourself. What about the revolution? The revolution is dead. Not for me. Come... Let me go. You understand nothing. You weren't even born. You can't understand how it was. Incredible. Göran... Was strong. He was so strong. Everyone followed him. When he spoke, it meant something. The boys looked at him. The girls wanted him. And he chose me. He chose me. We went out to change the world. But you didn't. Annika Bengtzon, this is my story. I'll tell the press. And I'll tell everything. Make sure you scoop it. Take care. Bye. Annika. Friday night party fun. Are you ready? Yes, time for you to go to work. Children? For a few days. I love you. See you soon.
