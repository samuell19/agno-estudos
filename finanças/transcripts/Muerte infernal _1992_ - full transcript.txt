We've been over this You're too sensitive Laurence But Mother, I just wanted it for a show What's wrong Mommy? I just wanted it for my show But Mother, Mommy, I just wanted it for the show, just for my work I just wanted it for the show Mommy Mommy, please I'm confused Lorenzo Your son has grown so quickly and he's very delicate like you were Lorenzo, and I'm afraid that- You'd love him but he's so delicate I'm confused, I should tell him about you, about how much we desired a child just before you slept forever My love, three more days and we would have- He would have- I'll tell him the whole truth Your birthday dear, it was yesterday This is for you This year once again, the dirt from your country where you told me to send your remains to rest I couldn't let you go so far away Lorenzo Laurence Laurence! Where have you been all this time? We had a lunch date Did you forget? No, but you went to the graveyard like always How did you know that? I know And how much do you know? I know you go every Sunday That's true, and we also eat lunch together, don't we? Isn't this our day? But you were upset with me That was yesterday I made a mistake Laurence, what's wrong with you? Why are you here? I have an idea for a new show - What is it - Well, see, there's a new doll, I found a doll in my house, Mother must have forgotten about it I found it in the store room, you should see him Margaret, he looks so real, he's as big as- he's nearly this tall, really! He's like a clown, he's dressed in nice clothes, like from the time of kings and queens Oh, he's a buffoon, like midget or something Yes, how do you know that? From books on artists who do paintings Laurence If this doll is like you say he is how did your mother forget about him all this time? I don't know What's wrong Laurence? What's going on with you? Don't touch me You can sleep here if you want My mom will understand, I'll think of something to tell her My dad works the night shift Would you like that? I mean, you don't have to do it if you don't want me to touch you, but the bed is narrow I... I wanted it to be a surprise, I wanted to see you happy It's my way to say I'm sorry Laurence It's alright Relax, calm down Mommy, I wanted to make love to Margaret, but I couldn't I couldn't do it! It's alright dear, relax Calm down, everything's over now Everything is alright, Mommy is with you, relax That's it I hope you know how to swim Couldn't do it with your girlfriend last night? Where's your girlfriend faggot, that bony girl needs a bath too Yeah, she needs to take a bath Tell me Laur, what do you do when you're over there at night? - C'mon, go on, Ben saw you - That's right Laurence, Laurence, what happened? Laurence, please don't go! There's nothing wrong with you! I have to talk to you, don't go! There's really nothing wrong... Ah, you must be Mrs. Mercero, you're a bit early but come in Would you please take a seat here Mrs. Mercero? He was fine yesterday and now he's in a hospital and you're a doctor, what do you mean he's alright? This is not a medical hospital, I'm a psychiatrist Mrs. Mercero When I said alright I meant physically for a lad who's quite sick and rode his bicycle off the bridge near the park Let me add that according to witness testimony it was no accident, it was a suicide attempt stemming from his sickness How can you claim such a thing so quickly Doctor? Why are you upset Mrs. Mercero? I'm simply giving you my professional diagnosis based on several years of treating schizophrenics Alright, you're a bit old for this but it's time to void your bowels, so you can go to the bathroom and do it yourself or I'll have to wait here for you to get around to it, what do you say? Sit on your own butt and do it yourself I'll be back as soon as I speak to the Doctor Not in Toledo The man that sold you to Lorenzo put a note in your clothes It was written by the person that preserved you Lorenzo read it to me once, but... In this form I, the King's doctor, was given the corpse of the favorite concubine of the Queen and a few other ladies of the court to mummify in punishment for his sexual atrocities and to turn him in to a doll forever So my little clown liked pinching butts and hiding under the dresses of all those elegant women at court, isn't that so? And then seducing the Royal Doctor's wife of all people Doll, that was a big mistake I had a long talk with your mom She's a beautiful person She's very smart and understanding She wants to visit you very much but the hospital rules state that patients can't recieve visitors until they've been here two weeks Or until the faculty deems it appropriate given the patient's condition Would you like to see your mother? Holly, dear, would you come here? I think it's too soon for him to see his mother But he's recovered so quickly, he's observing, listening, maybe even understanding I think your initial diagnosis was too severe Well now, you'll get used to his little tricks in time but for now it would be best if you don't say anything and don't mention it again for now You of course know what brought him here Alright They say you're creative, that you make your own puppets and masks, throw your own shows Would you like to have materials to work here? Yes, of course I'll see what's in the hospital, I'm sure we have something that'll be useful I'd prefer if you brought my dolls and things from home, that way I could put on a show and entertain the patients, if that wouldn't be a bother Then we'll see what we can bring from your home I'd take the two three meter chickens to a psychiatrist, he'd shrink them back to their right size Let's see what you have under those feathers Ah ha, you laid an egg! Thank you, thank you dear public Thank you very much Now ladies and gentlemen, the star of the show, recently back from a European tour, the favorite of Kings and Queens. Yermo, Buffoon of the Court! Give him a round of applause! Excuse me, but I am a buffoon of kings and queens I came from my country a long time ago I knew a princess in a cathedral She was really hot and I was really ugly, right? Of course I always tried to fool the king Excuse me I've never learned my manners over the centuries and I've been locked in a box for a very long time Kings were very bad and ordered many people to be murdered, but in silence, they did it with doctors that were worse than any assassin and also Excuse me again, but kings and princesses do that too This, yes, look closely, listen closely so you don't forget your friend Yermo because doctors nowdays are crazy Now dear, why haven't you turned off the lights? So early? It's late, it's been over an hour What's wrong, can't you sleep? You're going to cause a fire You know, I don't care what anyone says, I enjoyed your show Those final words were a bit vulgar but that doesn't bother me Of course, it wasn't very prudent to call doctors crazy I can't lie though, I enjoyed it You know little one, you're good looking You ain't bad yourself Listen, can't you speak to me yourself? I won't bite But I'd bite you all over Listen to this little guy I'm not so little, come and see for yourself Let's have a look then We're going to put you back in your box That's what I'll do Hey, it's not here Where are you little one? Help! Help! Leave me alone! Excuse the delay, but I had trouble finding your store - It's very far - Yes How do you get clients here? They know where I am, of course I see What a lovely collection of dolls I've never seen so many Mine are of another kind you know, except my favorite, that one was different I doubt this is a social visit Dr. O'Hara, on the telephone they told me you had something urgent to tell me - That's true - Yes, of course Dr. Richter called to talk to you about Laurence and... well, he's a very busy man, he hasn't felt well and he had a heart attack recently, he hasn't recovered yet I don't feel the slightest pity I understand he might have been a bit rude telling you about your son but, well, it's just one of his responsibilities and he has so many I'm sure that's true. Dr. O'Hara, why have you come? Is Laurence here with you? I don't know where Laurence is What a shame The nurse was severely beaten Mrs. Mercero, I want to help your son I don't believe you You're no one, no one at all It's Dr. Richter that's in charge and he's done enough damage Once you have something to say about matters of life and death you'll be just like them, all those doctors that are more concerned about their prestige and money than they people they must help Why do you dislike doctors? I was about to get married to one some time ago, a brave and talented man He suffered a horrible car accident I know the doctors could have saved him You don't have any medical knowledge, how do you know that? There was an inquiry, it was determined the doctors were negligent He didn't matter to them He was a foreigner and he was different I'm sorry I wouldn't worry that your doctor friend might have another attack, he has a heart made of ice Come up please Your maid let me in I told her to I was very interested in speaking to you outside the hospital That's good Sit - Do you want a drink? - No About the Mercero case... do you insist on helpin him? It's just that... he's really not that sick Holly, don't interfere I feel he needs my help I could change this report What must I do to convince you? Give in to my desires Well.. did I tell you I spoke to Mrs. Mercero? You saw her? After everything I told her? Yes, I went to her house, I thought Laurence would be there, then- That's a matter for the police You have a relation of authority with her, nothing more Damn, if I wasn't in love with you... How could you fall in love with an idiot like me? Don't say that, you're not dumb Jesus Holly, don't make me change that report Can't you see what it would do to me? Emmanuel, I need your help, and that boy needs mine I'm real hungry, I hope mom goes to bed soon - I want to sleep with her - Shut up Can't you forget your sexual obsession? What do you think I've been living for all these hundreds of years? Why don't you put out the flame you have in your guts? How should I do that, by drinking lots of water? That wouldn't get rid of your anxiety Oh yeah? What would you do in my place, seeing as you have so many ideas Laurence Laurence Laurence Please Why are you dressed? I have to work early tomorrow and you have to change the report tonight Relax, I'm here with you Holly... you don't have to go, please calm down You know, many people who are qualified also make mistakes Emmanuel, this wasn't necessary Come I love you very much Stay with me tonight No, I don't have the time Holly I'll be awake for a while longer changing that report in case you change your mind Hello Mrs. Mercero Is your store closed? Yes, excuse me Margaret but I'm very busy Maam, did you hear about Laurence's doctor? A nurse told my mother that he died What? What did the nurse say? He had a heart attack Mrs. Mercero, I miss your son very much Mrs. Mercero, is Laurence home? If he is I wouldn't tell anyone I don't know where Laurence is Maam Last week, these flowers... Who would do such a thing? Who was it Lorenzo? I pay the man who keeps watch to- What does it say here? King Charles V The king's fool? Laurence Lorenzo, Laurence was here? It can't be It's my fault, I seperated the father from the son I seperated them, of course That must have hurt him terribly You know Julia I understand why you wouldn't come back to my office so soon after what happened with the nurse You work many hours Yes, that's true, a double shift every other Sunday Today was a tiring day Dr. Richter... I'm very sorry I think it was very brave of you to come here and tell me how you feel My confession? No, better said your realization Thank you for seeing me in this terrible time Think nothing of it When we find Laurence or when he finds himself and returns I want you to know one thing We'll do everything we can for him Thank you For me Help! Open the door, you hear me? Doctor Answer me, what's going on? Are you alright? I'm fine, I'm fine Quite fine, quite fine Oh Margaret, it's you, come in I need to speak to you Mrs. Mercero, it's important I made love to Laurence maam I know all about it He told me just that It was the night before he was committed to the hospital It had to to happen at some point So many things happened to Laurence that sent him to the hospital Believe me, what happened between you two was the least of it But for Laurence, it was the best thing that could have happened Do you really think so? Of course I do Has he come back? Have you seen him? I got a message from him, a gold coin It belonged to his father I probably lost it years ago, he must have had it That's great, I'm happy Laurence did that Yes Margaret I should be going, goodbye Margaret, will you come visit? I'm very alone without him I've been neglecting you, isn't that right? Mommy Laurence? Is that you? You see? We've been found It's all because of your racket What do you expect me to do, I haven't spoken in many years and the only thing you ever say is you want to see your mommy, well there she is But she's so angry with me What have you done that's so bad? Laurence, I'm not upset with you But I know you'll blame me, everyone does for what you did! Mom, it was him, Yermo did it! Run, run, all he talks about is sleeping with you! Run please, get away from him! He won't listen to be mom, run! Run mom, run! Oh god, god
