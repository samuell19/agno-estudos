My father didn't want me. Neither did my mother. That's why he took me in. Who? Devil. I make bombs for criminal groups. Those 47 bomb attacks - it's me. I kidnapped 109 people. And I make top-notch amphetamine. I like you ma'am. I want to get to know you better. Maybe now... tell me about yourself. Sure... but... Why don't you tell me more about those... bombs? THE SON OF DEVIL I used to live by a railroad track. It's where trains carrying weapons used to pass during the war. A lot of shells and bombs still lie buried in the ground. It is a miracle I didn't get to blow myself up when I opened that. I detonated my first bomb outside a church at the age of seven. The priest used to allow kids to set off firecrackers at Christmas. So I made one of my own. I remember what I said then. - Awesome. - This is how you ride in style. Don't get overexcited, kid, or you'll get a crooked orgasm. - Mama, I'm hungry. - Go and steal something. Sponger. My father left my mother when she was pregnant. She hated men. Including myself. My mother ran a brothel in our apartment. I stayed up at night, because hookers were copulating with their clients - in my bed. - Mama, I'm sleepy. Don't be with fire, or your ass will burn. It's my money, so it's none of your fucking business. I should've choked you in my cunt. - Can you get out? I need to piss. - Just a moment. I started reading the "Little Electronic" ” magazine and developing new detonation methods. Hurry up. Time is money. Done! The house will be closed for a week. You're robbing me! - I don't want to see you again! - After that incident, she kicked me out of the house. Hey, you! In the following years, I would steal, sleep in stairwells... - Get out of here! - ...and hide in sheds. And I made bombs. At the age of fourteen, I got smarter and decided to start my first business. - This cunt is stealing from us. - Fuck her. Girls, - how much does my mother pay you? - Why? I have an offer. 30 percent. We'll go fifty-fifty. And you'll work for me. That's how I stole all the whores from my mother and set up my own brothel next door. Have ya ever gotten laid before? No. Then, how are you gonna be our pimp, if you don't know the business? Let's solve the problem then. Stand up. Let him fuck each of us, so that he can compare. That's what my sexual initiation looked like. When my mother found out I'd stolen her hookers, she flipped out. If I'd known I'd be such a scum, I would've had my cunt scraped. Then I heard a voice in my head saying, "kill her." On that day, the Devil triggered a chemical reaction in my head. It awoke another self in me of whose existence I had not known before. For fourteen years I had no idea... It was living in me. And I understood, I was capable of anything. I ran a brothel for another 18 years. I spent the money it earned me on TNT, dynamite, and Semtex. I experimented with all possible explosives and learnt their properties. Over time, blowing up wrecks at construction sites was no longer enough for me. I dreamt of blowing up people. That is when the Devil came up with a solution. - Is this your whorehouse? - Yeah. Time to pay. - Pay for what, and to who? - To Pershing, for protection. In those days every thug in Poland had known the nickname "Pershing" ”. The very sound of it made them pee their pants. Tell your boss I'm not interested. Good day. - What the fuck did you just say bitch? - I decided to be unconventional. Get us fucking glasses. Go! They kept me in the couch for three days straight. In the meantime, they drank, got high, raped the girls, and robbed every client that came in. What's that? Shopping list. Seven meters of chains, a drill, anchors? A minibus, newspapers... A sledge hammer, black stockings, plastic foil, chloroform... A warehouse, or a house with seven rooms... What's it gonna be? A minibus for kidnapping people. I knew the Pruszkéw gang frequented Kaskada in Brwinow. I hid in the shadows waiting for the gangsters from my brothel. I got to know the habits of all seven of them, and where each of them lived. Then I started to hunt them down and snatch them one by one. What the fuck? I'd kidnapped all seven of them by Thursday. Now all I had to do was wait. For what? Pershing's gonna pay us a visit. Pruszkéw couldn't imagine that a single man had managed to kidnap seven thugs. They thought they had trespassed on the turf of some criminal organization. Pershing himself came to the meeting. They showed their strength and expected an equally strong competition to arrive. Where are your men? There is no men. I can see that. I'm asking where is your crew. There is no crew. What's he talking about? Who are you with? Nobody. Who kidnapped my boys, then? I did. You did seven of them all by yourself? It was just a demonstration. Of what? My potential. What are you selling? My service. Why? "Cause I want to work with you." If you use TNT, the blast won't go into the wall, but outside. If you want it inwards, you use C4. I can match any kind of explosives. And create bombs depending on your needs. I can construct an explosive as thin as a piece of paper and send it in a letter. I can blow up a man with his dog's collar. I can make wooden bombs that metal detectors won't find. Fancy that. Pershing did business with the Russian mob. Make a list of explosives and equipment you need. He decided to use it in our plans. - Fedor and Zenia are with Alpha. - What's "Alpha"? Special Forces. They smuggle heroin and weed from Russia, and buy amphetamine from us. They can provide you with anything you need. - How many can you deliver? - As many as you need. We have unlimited access to the explosive materials of the Russian Army. That's how I started blowing up people. Hey. Since Pershing had a lot of enemies, I got to blow up more and more of them. And I had fun while doing it. There they are. Oh... wow... The other guy Maniek... I actually liked him. Seems like the whole floor got fucked up. It's possible. There were some hilarious moments, too. It's no joking matter. You activate the explosive with your cell. Turn on the phone after you put the bomb underneath the car. But Kazek turned on the cell phone too soon. The phone was new, so the carrier sent him a welcome text message and Kazek got torn into pieces. We should proceed with our ideas. Why blow up competition? If we can blow up gas stations. - Why would we do that? - For extortion. I'll plant a bomb at Shell. When they get scared, we'll tell them to pay monthly, or we'll blow up more stations. - Who's this? - Off with the Mafia! Kaczynski. A prosecutor. He organized a demonstration to let people know he's going to hose us down. I'll blow him up as a part of a demonstration. Waste of materials. What can he do? I put aluminum foil in my mouth, because it works like a voice modulator. There is a bomb at Shell on Ostrobramska Street. You have to pay million dollars. If you try to tamper with the bomb, it will go off. But they didn't listen. The police sent their Pyrotechnicians in. They didn't know they were dealing with a guy they could learn from. After the pyrotechnician's death, my path crossed with that of another man for the rest of my life. Hello. Here... Good evening, boss. Father Marek Klimaszewski, a police chaplain. Gebels. They may blow each other up. But he was one of us. Find out who did it. Only Pershing and a couple of his closest associates knew about me. One of them was a gangster whom I had kidnapped, when he tried to extort protection money from my brothel. In the criminal environment he was known as "Masa". How are you, Masa? All good, Jacus. Fuck snitches, fuck traitors, to hell with them. And fuck sympathizers, let them all die. Masa... Who planted the bomb at Shell? Well, I can ask around, and try to find out who put it there. I don't care who put it there. I wanna know who made it. There's one guy behind all the explosions in Poland. And no one knew that at that time he was already snitching to the cops. I saw you putting stuff out on a shelf. You were so precise about it, as if it was a work of art. Can I help you? I thought... we could pull our lives together. We have something in common. What? My job requires perfection. Why won't you say anything? People think that when they don't speak, they are silent. But it's not true. So... Why don't you ask me out for a coffee? Okay. Here I am. So... Should I pick a coffee place? I have never felt for any woman what I feel for you. I want to get married and have kids with you. For a good start, why don't we introduce ourselves first? Renata. Nos. That's your last name? Nickname. What's your name, then? Andrzej Patucki? Metropolitan Police. You're under arrest. You interrupted my date. It wouldn't work out anyway. Why? You're going to jail. - For what? - You made 41 bombs, which went off at different locations in Poland. I've made more. I'm interested in only one. The one that killed the cop. They had to wipe him off the street. Why are you telling me that? Because now I'm gonna wipe you off. You have no evidence. - I know. - So what now? I'll fuck you over for something else. What's up? I feel damn shitty. I fell asleep on my stomach, totally wasted, and my foot was twisted. I cracked the joint in my toe, and I can't walk. I rubbed some crap into it, but it didn't help. I need a piece that was used in the crime. Grenade, grenade... Police! Police! Get down! Leave us. You think you're more clever. Than the guy that's gonna shit in his prison suit for someone else's gun? Yeah, I think I am. I'll prove you're wrong. I'm not sure you'll have time for that. Because of that gun, we'll charge you for a robbery on currency exchange point. And when you get released, I'll find something else to bust you. It's not gonna end like this. Then how? You put a gun in my hands, but the blood will be on yours. Gentlemen, come here. Happy fucking. Will you wait for me? Yeah... Why are you crying? They took you way too soon... You said... We're gonna get married, have a family, you said you wanted to have a kids with me. Nothing has changed. Can we talk a little bit longer? You have to decide... Decide what? You wanna talk, or have a baby. I do appreciate the immense effort the prison management has put into my rehabilitation. And I know that one day I will re-enter society. Family is a foundation that will give me strength to stay out of jail, so I am asking you to grant me a two-week leave, to see my newborn baby. We're going. Come on. My sweet baby... go to daddy. Go to daddy. Don't you cry. Daddy loves you, Arturek. Oh... Here, here. - I'll be right back. - Let me take him. I don't wanna leave him. These old pricks from Pruszkow have united against me. They're fucking mad, 'cause I stole their golden goose. - What goose? - Masa. They pumped dough out of him. Now he pays me. 50%. On all his businesses in exchange for protection against those farts. You gotta handle Pruszkow when you're out. I can't even blink, "cause I'm watched." - When are you going back to jail? - In two days. Do you need anything? A silencer. What for? To kill a man. Yes? - A long night's ahead, gentlemen. - Take the boss's wife and give her some Valium. - We don't know anything. - Nobody saw anything. Yeah? Andrzej Patucki is calling from Biatoteka penitentiary. Put him through? Yeah. Do you know why a prison phone can't be tapped? Yeah, I do. Even if you record our conversation, it can't be used as evidence. I see you're getting bored. But some of us are still working. Enjoy your time. You know I was out for two days? Listen, next time give me a call. I will take care of you for 48 hours. Remember when I said you'll have blood on your hands? Yeah, it gives me nightmares. Good. I want you to be aware of that. Aware of what? That you killed Papata. You will never find out who shot the sheriff. But I want you to know, you are the reason why I was at 17 Rzymowskiego Street yesterday at 10 p.m. Are you a priest by profession? By vocation. Can you keep a secret? As a priest? For the price of life. I know who killed Papata. But I can't prove it. If you were me, would you define justice, or wait for it to be done? Justice is hardly ever... done in this life. But there is a third option. What is it? Have no share in evil, but divert it instead. Let the wicked... sink in darkness they have colluded with. - What is it you wanted to talk in person? - I want to bust them all. Who? Pruszkow. Wanna get rid of those old pricks? Bro, of course I do. I love ya, man. Spread the news I want to meet with the Pruszkow bosses. But, for your own good... don't tell Pershing about it. Cheers. What? You can't kill Pershing. They are watching him. Come on, officer. We'd never do such a horrible thing. I can give you one day when he's not watched. Interested? We've set Pershing up with a chick that'll go to Hotel Kasprowy with him. - It'll happen there. - Spare me the details. We need to let Pershing off the hook for one day. When? December 5th. I'll return the skis, and you pack us for the road, honey. I'll surely pack you before we hit the road, Myszka. Speak. - He's walking to the car. - He's walking to his ride. - Let her eat the sim card. - Disconnect and eat the sim card. He's by his car. Get moving. Let's fuck him up. See? I told you. Something's wrong, would you take a look? Okay, show me. I'll try my best. What now? What? - What happened? - Someone collapsed. - Call an ambulance. - Who has a phone? Call the police. He got shot. Call the police. Move back. Call the ambulance. - Tell me what happened. - I saw him lying here. Right here. I was with my friend, we heard gunshots. We didn't see who did it. I didn't see anything else. - We'll go look for reception. - Thank you. Jacus, what now? Help me. I have an offer... Become a crown witness. Become who? We made a new institution in Poland. You can have a new life in return for your testimony. Does it mean I can't be a thug anymore? But I fucking love that shit too much. Masa? You can be next. You know I'm the golden goose. Maybe they won't whack me off. In revenge for Pershing I'm gonna kill the old pricks, their women and children. - And then, I'll take over the country. - How will you whack them? I'm off to a hotel that has CCTV cameras. You should come with me. - Why? - To have proof we haven't killed anyone. Pershing's gone. I'm taking over his business. From now on, I'm buying heroin and weed from you. - I need you to do me a favor. - What kind of favor? Kill twenty one people. I would do it myself, but they are watching me. Get a crew from Russia that will do the job, and will cross the border on the same day. I need help, Remek. - You need something defused? - No. I want you to make a bomb and plant it on a thug. Why are you honking?! Stop fucking honking! Got a problem, old fart?! - Something's hanging underneath your car. - What? Run for fuck's sake! I'm sorry, Jarek. Prosecutor, this is Masa. He decided to become the first crown witness in Poland. He'll testify against Pruszkow family. Police! On the ground! On the ground! For 48 hours? For a long time, Andrzej... - Police! On the ground! - Show me your hands! On the ground! Police! On the ground! Hands behind your head! Pruszkow is done. Do you want us to pop their wives and kids? In this case, it doesn't make much sense. I have seen the wicked exultant, towering like a cedar of Lebanon. When next I passed he was gone, I searched for him and he was nowhere to be found. Observe the innocent, consider the honest, For the future belongs to the man of peace. But... the wicked will all be destroyed together, The offspring of the godless shall be erased. Come on son, let's check out some Matchbox cars. - We need to find a money-changer. - Money-what? 200. Buy me one, daddy. I can't afford it, Jarek. Foreign currency. Sell, buy. I'll take all of them. And this jacket. I love you. Want it? CAPTIVITY 145 horsepower, 1.2 turbo. Can you lease her for me? Son, I haven't seen you since last year. I have to pay off my loans. Why do you need a new car? - Whatever. - Let's sit down and talk. I have classes. I want that jacket. How can I buy one? Dad... You set up an account, buy Euros, apply for a multi-currency card and buy the shit. Are you going to practical classes? Gentlemen. Remember? The SSWiN alarm system consists of an emergency exchange, expanders, a manipulator, sensors, indicators and notification systems, GSM modules, the Ethernet, and dialers. I can't afford a drink in a bar, clothes, movies. I've had enough of this shitty life. Same here. All I can afford is a city card. It's not gonna change until we graduate. No. - I'm gonna start robbing houses. - Dude... Maybe we're gonna have our own mob. How about that? We're only computer geeks, not gangsters. House alarms are installed by rich people. - Yep. - We know how to disarm them. We just need to buy some certified locks so we can work them out. We pick only expensive villas. We'll get to know the owners' daily routines, and wait until they leave. Most important: We can't hurt anyone. By the use of a terminal we list the devices connected to the network and the port that communicates with them. We scan the ports and overwrite the firmware with a newer version so that we can access the micro-system. Connect to the system. Replace the live camera feed to the cloud, - with a loop recorded a minute earlier. - Done. Turn off the alarm. Got it. Okay, let's go. - Look only for expensive stuff. - Sure. - I've got diamonds. - Watches. - Nothing. - Same here. I've got a PlayStation. Who wants to play? Are you shitting me? Focus on finding the diamonds' certificates. Without them, we'll get some pocket change. And they'll know they've been stolen. - Let's get out of here. - Locks. Arm the alarm and restore live feed in 5 minutes. We have legit merchandise with papers. We'll put them up for sale at different jewelers'. Each item goes to a different town. My mom passed away. I want to get rid of it. Color C, a certificate from Antwerp, they never lie about the parameters. - What's the price? - I still need to evaluate the gems, but I believe one hundred thousand will be a decent price. - My grandpa loved this watch. - Audemars Piguet Royal Oak will go for one hundred twenty thousand. A Rolex in Coca Cola colors is hard to get in Poland. It sells for over 200. I could cut you a quick deal of 150. - What? - 150,000 Zlotys. Now we reach the most critical point. Success will get into our heads the money will wash our brains out, we will act cocky, start showing off, and party hard. Someone will eventually snitch on us, and we will be fucked. Or... We won't lose our heads because of the money. We're gonna do a few more houses, we will be set up for the rest of our lives. In that case, they'll never get to us. Why? "Cause we're fucking polytechnic students and we have nothing to do with the criminal underworld. We'll buy clothes so that we don't have to jerk off, but could finally mingle with some hot chicks. So don't get freaky, bro. One set per head. - Sandra. - Lucyna. Asia. - So, what's your story? - We're computer geeks. - If you want, I can tell a joke. - Shoot away. What bra size does a programmer's girlfriend have? C++ I love that song. Let's dance. - I'm not a good dancer. - I'll teach you. First we're gonna swing a little bit. Follow my rhythm... Look at me. Feel the heat. Let's go to my place. All right. Okay. Nice place. Have you designed it? Less talking, more fucking. I get it! Wait, shouldn't I use a condom? I'm gonna take your cock out before you come. - What the fuck was that? - My bad... Don't apologize. I'm gonna put it up again. Chief, a villa owner reported being robbed of 700 thousand. His insurance company doesn't want to pay, because there are no signs of forced entry. They believe the owner has robbed himself to extort insurance money. Why are you telling me that? Because an owner of a villa in Mokotow filed an identical report at the same time. He claims he's been robbed of half a million. No signs of forced entry. The watches, jewelry, certificates - all gone. Who knows the alarm pass code and has the keys? - No one, except us. - Do you have a housemaid? My wife's a perfectionist. She cleans the house herself. Have you recently been notified of an activated house alarm? No. - When was the robbery? - I've no idea. My wife wanted to wear her ring. She realized it was gone. She started looking and discovered all our valuables had disappeared. Alright. Set me up with our best house robber in Warsaw. One that's loyal to us. Could you rob a house like this? No. - Do you know anyone who could? - It's no one from the thieves underworld. Let's get out of here. A golden shot. It's filled with guns. We don't know who lives here. Guys! Let's go! - Someone's here! - The owner. Lei's skat! Leave it! Okay, we're good. - That's what 99% of the people would do. - What'd 1% do? Go to the police. Report a stolen ID. Let's think outside the box. The police don't find any stolen stuff on you. They have no phone logs to prove you're guilty. We have to behave as usual. We must hide the loot. No more heists. Keep your mouth shut. And we'll hire lawyers that will get us out of jail if needed. Hello, I'd like to report a stolen ID. - Police. Marc in Bobruk? - Yes. - You're under arrest. - What is this about? You'll find out at the station. Tell me about that break-in. - Police. Mr. Piotr Wisniewski? - Yes. You're under arrest. Come with us. Jarostaw Goc? Police. You're being detained for questioning. - I need my lawyer. - You'll call him from the station. Fuck... Where is my jacket? My men will go with you to collect the stolen items. You'll pay a penalty of 10 million zlotys. You have one month. I will kill another one of you, and the penalty will increase by 100%, every month. If you hide, I will kill your families. Get up. We've gotta get that dough. To make 10 million, we'll have to do one house per day. So what are we waiting for? - Let's goin. - Wait. Let's see what time she'll get back. And come back tomorrow. - We'll do the job then. - Wait! Fuck. Guys, get down! He's alive. - Call an ambulance. - Now?! Take Wisnia and activate the alarm. They'll find him. Activate it! No more unexpected visitors. We'll get in when the residents are inside. You almost killed a man. I haven't signed up for that. I don't give a fuck what you've signed up for. You got us in this shit. We'll buy sleeping gas and oxygen masks. Wisnia's out until he gets better. We're gonna hit another house tonight. Four construction workers were carrying the fifth. - How old did they look? - I don't know... I saw their backs. They looked young. - Did they turn on the alarm? - Reeds in the windows? And motion sensors in the garden. We'll wait for an hour and then go in. - Give me the cord. - What for? Who fucking knows when they'll wake up. Let's turn them over. Shut up. I'll take the tape off. And you're gonna be quiet. Kamil, help! Shut your fucking mouth! - Get me a knife. - Are you nuts?! I said, get me a fucking knife! I'm gonna take my hand off and if you scream again, I will fuck you up. What's the code? - I don't know... - The code, I said... - I guess it's the same as the alarms... - Which is? 172862. Are you fucking with me? Do you want me to cut your tits off?! I really don't know. It's Kamil's safe... Leave him alone! I said fuck off! Please, no... See what's happening? Code to the safe, or she's history. 178262. Bingo... Pack it up. - What other valuables do you have? - I don't know... - Don't lie to me! - M29... - What? - Fangor's painting. - Where? - On the wall in the living room. - How much is it worth? Over one million. What a piece of crap... - No one will buy it if it's cut. - I won't run around with the frame. If you damage it, it'll be worthless. You know what? Get the fuck out. I have enough of your bullshit. - Help us out. It's heavy. - Okay, wait. Help! Help! - We've got to finish her. - No. - She's a witness. - [t was an accident. - But now it'll be a murder. - Out of my way. You gotta kill me first. Sobol, people have woken up... Let it go man, we gotta go, now. We'll get 25 years... Shut the fuck up. Fuck... Keep it slow. No! We can't communicate with her. She has to be taken to a mental hospital. A couple of more heists like this and we'll be even. Wanna say something? That's what I thought. Tomorrow, 8 p.m. Dad... Help me, please. He told us to pay him 10 million. And 100% penal interests for each month of delay. I didn't know what to do. He sliced Bobruk. We just wanted to collect the money. We entered the house while the residents were inside. A man was killed... What am I supposed to do now? How many years will I get for it? Are you gonna say something? Dad, please... Hello. What will you have? Sir? - A bottle. - Of anything specific? Very well... Fucking hell. I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt, where you lived as slaves. You shall have no other gods to rival me. You shall not make yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything in heaven above or on earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. You shall not bow down to them, nor serve them. For I, Yahweh your God am a jealous God, and I punish a parent's fault in the children, the grandchildren, and the great-grandchildren among those who hate me; But | act with faithful love towards thousands of those who love me, and keep my commandments. I have to put my own child in jail. I came here to tell you. What stops you? Your reading. The Book of Exodus. What's that? God leads Israelites out of the Pharaoh's slavery. I believe it's the Word for you. What does God want from me? He won't make a decision for you. You have a free will. He showed you your choices. Between what? You may be a cop that arrests a criminal. Or a father that saves his child. Gabriel, I don't want to leave any trace in the system. Can you check the owner of the house at 190C Nateczowska Street? Maybe he has some tickets, or something. Come on man. You've gotta see this. Come on. We've ran out of paper. Will you tell me who that is? Yahweh said to Moses, 'Think of the wonders I have given you power to perform, once you are back in Egypt! You are to perform them before Pharaoh, but I myself shall make him obstinate, and he will not let the people go. You will then say to Pharaoh, "This is what Yahweh says: Israel is my first-born son. I told you: Let my son go and worship Me; But since you refuse to let him go, well then! I shall put your first-born son to death.” I'm gonna get you out of this. I promise. You'll get a new life. Now, go to that man and tell him you're my son. Please wait. - What? - I am Jacek Goo's son. So? I thought since you know my father, you may look differently, at what happened. How dare you come to my house empty-handed? Give me my money back. We are... trying... but... the... Then get your shit together and try harder. Now you owe me not 10, but 20 million. But Yahweh made Pharaoh stubborn and, as Yahweh had foretold to Moses, he did not listen to them. Yahweh then said to Moses, 'Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh. Say to him, "Yahweh, God of the Hebrews, says this:". Let my people go and worship me. For this time I am going to inflict all my plagues on you, on your officials and on your subjects, so that you will know "that there is no one like me in the whole world." He doubled the penalty. Good. How is it good? Did you hear what I said? - I expected him to do so. - So what now? I'll send plagues upon him. - Fuck... you went to the cops?! - To my father. - He'll snitch on us. - He'll help us. - He'll help you. - Don't do anything stupid. - He'll take care of that. - Take a chill pill. There is job to be done. We're doing as planned. Do you have lemon balm tea to calm me down? Weed is the best shit to calm you down. What are you afraid of? I don't want to tell you. - Let's go. - Let them fall asleep. I have to do two more houses this night. - Get him! - Fuck! - Mirek! - Go back to the bedroom! - Leave! - Help! - C'mon. - Upstairs. Shit! Get the door! - Close the door! - Go! Sobol, leave him alone! Leave him alone, Sobol! Let's get the fuck out of here! - Get inside. - Fuck. Now! Fucking drive. He's gone. Fuck... - I'm taking them in. - You promised to help me. I am. - I'm saving their lives. - You promised. If you're gonna bust them, then you will have to bust me too. Rafat... in my office in an hour. Get here Michat and Gabriel. EXODUS I need your help. Off the record. - We're all ears. - April 19th. A pack of thugs kidnapped a group of students. We need to access the CCTV recordings and get the pictures of those men and try to identify them. Here are the mugshots of those men. - They drove toward Nadarzyn. - Their hideout's there. The CCTV footage ends here. That's all I have. - What about those cars? - What you think? Fake plates. They're no ghosts. Let's use our contacts. Send out the pictures to our colleagues from other departments and prisons. They'll recognize one of them at least. And I have come down to rescue them from the clutches of the Egyptians, and bring them up out of that country, to a country rich and broad, to a country flowing with milk and honey, to the home of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites. We identified three of the thugs. Ryszard Mazurkiewicz, 25 years for abduction and assassination. Jakub Lach, 8 years for extortion. Marc in Fabisiak, 5 years for dealing cocaine. A tight crew. None of them has ever snitched, or cooperated with us. Rafat, turn the screws on them. Watch them closely. We need to find the weakest link SO we can scare him. Lach and Fabisiak have less experience, but they have nothing to lose. Mazurkiewicz is the toughest of them. He spent 25 years in jail, was in a prison gang. After 12 years his wife stopped visiting him, and filed for a divorce. He made a pen pal, King a Wojdak. He got her pregnant during one of the visits. During his time, he filed for the annulment of his marriage. They are attending a prenuptial course. They're scheduled for May 15th. They've bought a month-long honeymoon in the Maldives. I don't think he's ready to give up on his new life, and go to jail for another 25 years. He's my choice. Well then. The show must go on. Michat, take him down, but nobody can see you. Police, freeze! Show me your hands! Hands behind your back. Don't move. Anchor. You're going back to prison for another 25 years. You know for what? For being an accessory to the murder of Marc in Bobruk. We have arrested all of you. Nose. Lach. Fabisiak and everyone else that took part in it. Wanna call your lawyer, or King a, to tell her the wedding is canceled and she can find a new dad for your daughter? If you hurry, they may still make it to the Maldives. It'd be a shame to pass on such a trip. Especially if it's already paid for. Do you know what's going on in the other rooms right now? Your friends are listening to the same crap, and they're starting to think whether to cooperate with us. The deal is, there can be only one crown witness. You have 10 seconds to decide. Then I'll walk to another room to get myself a different witness. What do you wanna know about the murder? I know everything about it. - What's that? - An operational activities file. If you want to be free, you have to expose the other crimes of your group. You have to be registered as an informer. Write. Hereby, I volunteer to cooperate with the police and relay to them all the information concerning the crimes I witness. Your signature. Legible, please. - What about smuggling drugs to Poland? - What's the number? For the past 20 years, the group has brought here over 100 tons from Russia. Another five are next week. - Of what? - 3 tons heroin, 2 tons marijuana. - Do you take it from the Russians as a deposit? - We pay them. - Cash? - Bit coins on the Darknet. - Where do you get money for bit coins? - We make amphetamine. We sell it to Poles, and the dealers pay us in bit coins. - How do you sell it? - We send it to parcel lockers. Have you already sent out the amphetamine? - No. We'll do it on Friday. - I want the address of the warehouse, parcel lockers that you send the crank to, day and time when you're gonna do it, and names of people who are involved in it. - Can I ask you something? - It depends on the question. Why do you need information on the deals and the people, if they all are sitting next door? I lied to you. We didn't arrest anybody. I have recorded our conversation and your consent to cooperate. If you tell them about it, I'll give them the recording, and they'll kill you. Now go home. To be continued... Someone will call you. Aaron stretched out his hand, with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were mosquitoes on man and beast; All the dust of the earth turned into mosquitoes throughout the whole of Egypt. By their spells the magicians tried to produce mosquitoes in the same way but failed, and there were mosquitoes on man and beast. So the magicians said to Pharaoh, 'This is the finger of God'. But Pharaoh was obstinate and, as Yahweh had foretold, refused to listen to them. You'll visit him again. Do you have my money? No. - Then why are you here? - My father says he could destroy you. But he wants you to surrender. If you don't write off our debt, he'll take all the money from your organization. Tell your father. I'm not gonna back down. Police! On the ground! Police! On the ground! Spread your legs. Freeze! On your knees! Hands behind your head! We've confiscated 5 tons of amphetamine with the value of 300 million zlotys. - It's not enough. - How come?! We have to take over the thugs' personal assets. That also goes to their wives, children, mothers, fathers, and cohabitants. They must get completely cut off from the money, so they can't pay the Russians. Why? I want them to take the merchandise on deposit. It's a bit convoluted, but I trust you know what you're doing. - When can we install it? - Install what? The Warsaw PD is replacing all our computers. Our son has made legal donations to us. You have benefited from the proceeds of crime. - What are you going to take? - Your house, your valuables, your car, money in the bank. Everything. But Marc in and I have separate property. Your husband was involved in an organized crime ring. - Yes? - We have a warrant to secure your husband's assets. How did he find out about the amphetamine? Try to determine that. How? The Metro Police have put out a tender for recycling their old hard drives. I could set up a fake company, bid the best price, win the tender - and retrieve the data. - In Poland everything's possible. If it's gonna be Queen of hearts: We are meant to be. And we'll spend the rest of our lives together. Queen of hearts. - Hello? - Come. Tell your father to release my men, and I'll write your debt off. I'll file for an arrest warrant for them. Take them to court at 2 p.m. Release them, please. What? - Is it really over? - No. Nose's heart is too tough. I couldn't leave them alone. - On the ground! - What's happening? - Get down! - On the ground! - Get down! On the ground! Get down! - Where have they taken them? - I don't know. You don't? Nose disappeared. We don't know the guys he hired. He must've realized one of his own snitched. And he's looking for him. I don't know where his hideout is. I've won the tender for recycling the police hard drives. Paperwork for the reception of hard drives for recycling. He has to return 220 million by Friday, 6 p.m. In cash, or in drugs. Tell your father. Help! Help! Help! Please call that number! Renata? Give me the knife. Renata... I know who sold us out. The deal is going through as planned. On Friday, Nose takes over 5 tons of marijuana and heroin from the Russians. - Names of the Russians. - I only know two from Spetsnaz. Fedor Asamancev and Jewgienij Bakunin. Answer it. - Hello? - Let's meet about Friday. - Where? - 4 p.m. Your place. Sure. We'll secure your house. He won't even get inside. - Are you there? - Yes. Look out the window. What's that? It's not our drone. Get away from the window. Watch it! We'll let the Russians enter Poland. They'll lead us to Nose. We'll bust the Russians with the drugs before they get to him. - You want the Border Guard to take them down? - No, we'll do it ourselves. I only want them to plant a tracker. Let's get gas. They're pulling into a gas station. Now! On the ground! Hands! Hands! Hand. Gimme your hand. - Look at me. - Turn around. - What about the drugs? - Hide them. Place Nose's son and wife under surveillance. - Don't lose them. - On it. After what I'm about to do, his family will have to hide. - Go to Nose's house. - What? Please wait. My father has arrested the Russians. If Nose doesn't back down, - he'll tell them that they were sold by your organization. - Wait. - We won't track him. - How come? They communicate through Wi-Fi, and eliminate data exchange agents. Their IP is untraceable. There's no way to establish whom the guy's calling - and where his interlocutor is. - Tell him... "NO-" Take away our men and their families, my son and my wife, to a safe place. You've been sold by Nose's organization. Coffee? Pizza? It'll take a while. Renata. Renata! Renata! Get down! For this time I am going to inflict all my plagues on you, on your officials and on your subjects, so that you will know that there is no one like me in the whole world. Had I stretched out my hand to strike you and your subjects with pestilence, you'd have been swept from the earth. But I have let you survive for this reason: To display my power to you and to have my name talked of throughout the world. Berek... - You want me to stay with them? - Get back. We'll negotiate. You may go. Michat... Watch him. Release the hostages and write the debt off, or... my father will send the Russians after you. I'm gonna release women and children. Those who robbed me - no. It's quite good. I could let you out any moment. How come you have so much power? No one knows you've been detained but me. - What about the drugs? - Hidden. Will you give them back? - I can't inform you about my decision. - Why would you let us go? I'm diverting... the vector of evil. Send a fully kitted-up team to Poland. Let two cars from Russia to Poland without inspection. License plates: AA 210792 and C 217 HA 75. That night, I shall go through Egypt and strike down all the first-born in Egypt, man and beast alike, and shall execute justice on all the gods of Egypt, I, Yahweh! The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. And you will escape the destructive plague when I strike Egypt. Go to him for the last time. Release everyone and let the debt off. Or your men, their families, your wife and son will die. Don't come here again. If you do, I'll kill you. Here, copy that. - What's this address? - He's hidden them there. What time is the destroyer supposed to come? - At midnight. - Which rooms? The doors of the innocent will be marked. Do not enter there. Give Michat the list of the rooms of regular hotel guests. Encode the room cards. Take me out of here. Watch the Russians until they leave Poland. - Will you give us our drugs back now? - Go back to Russia. - What are we doing with Nose? - There are no evil people. Man is good. He just succumbs to evil. When Nose's heart breaks, he'll back down. But only for a moment. They killed them. My son and wife too? Everybody's dead. You shall have no other gods to rival me. You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your God, for Yahweh will not leave unpunished anyone who misuses his name. Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. For six days you shall lab our and do all your work. Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land that Yahweh your God is giving you. You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false evidence against your neighbor. You shall not set your heart on your neighbor's house. You shall not set your heart on your neighbor's spouse, or servant, man or woman, or ox, or donkey, or any of your neighbor's possessions. Let them go. What? Let them all go. You heard me. Uncuff them. Let them go. Walk that way. There's a town over the river. When the darkness swallows him again, he will want to destroy. Destroy what? Everything. Let's kill them. Move. Give me your phone! We gotta call for help! They let us out! - Where are you? - I don't know. Track my phone. Don't call the cops. My father will pick you up. Number 533726118, I'm 4 km away from them. They're in Kampinos Forest. Track them down. Run! We're running away from the kidnappers. Piotr Sobolewski, Pilarski Marc in, Klember Krzysiek... And some women and kids. Send us a whole fucking army here, or we're dead. A dozen, or so. They're shooting at us. We can't pick them up. They called 911 and displayed as wanted. The police sent a CT unit, criminal investigators and cops for them. They're setting up a perimeter. Find out where they're running. We'll wait behind the manhunt. Sandra! They're gonna kill us! Dad, I'm with them! Don't look back. Focus on running. This is your son and the hostages, those are the cell phones of the kidnappers, and these are the cell phones of the police officers surrounding the area. Hurry up! Your son and the kidnappers are running straight into the police. - Dad! - Don't waste your energies on talking. Keep running. Fake the location of the hostages' and kidnappers' cells. Send the police sideways and make them break up. Keep running. Do not veer. Show me the true location of my son's and the kidnappers' phones. Dad, Sobol's dead! They're out. Give the police the true location of the kidnappers. Hide the location of my son's cell from the police. You may stop running. No one's chasing you anymore. Stop... There's a river 0,5 km ahead of you. Get across it. I'll be there. That's my dad. Let's go. - Where are the drugs? - I burnt them. - You really thought we'd leave Poland? - Yes I did. I gave you... a chance. You have been granted a new life. I will give you new rules you will have to follow. Stick to them, and you will live happily ever after. If... you decide to break them, I'll respect your choice. And I'll come for you at 6 in the morning. [ Will.
