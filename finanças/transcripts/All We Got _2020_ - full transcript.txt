You know, tripping. Come on Lee. No, for real like tripping, tripping. Do you remember Billy's Bar up the street? Yeah. So, Renee and Flip are hanging out at Billy's one day and Flip comes up with this idea. He's like, "Yo, you and me "Need to go ahead and be rappers. "Start playing. "Get these bars laid out." "What's up." And Renee falls for it obviously. And she's like, "Oh my God, I was waiting for you to ask me that "I can be like Cardi and you can be like Drake "And we can make all this money getting Grammy's," "Have cars and Lamborghini's and stuff." And that obviously didn't work out. Hey, what's up y'all? - What's going on? - What's going on everybody? - How you guys doing today? - What's good? - Yo. - Hey. Y'all doing okay? - Damn. - Man, that's okay, that's good. - Put your hands up. - Put your hands up, go. - Lets see your pockets. - I wanna see you in the back. - Empty your pockets. - In the back. Look in your pockets, look in your pockets. Now give me some money. Give it up, give it up, - give me some money. - Give it up. Give it up, give it up, give me some money. Come on man. Give it up, give it up, give me some money. (Flip and Renee rapping incoherently) And moving, and grooving. - Now move it. - Damn, you're fucking it up. You got the bars, I got the moves. You got the bars, I got the moves. Moves, you said you took the whole thing. (Flip and Renee rapping incoherently) I'm out. Yeah fuck you. And that obviously didn't work out. Oh, and you remember how Flip used to work at that junk yard? [Kristin] Yeah. So Flip calls Renee from the junk yard one day and he's like, "Hey yo, Renee, Renee." And she was like "Yeah, yeah, yeah", "What's up? What's up?" And he was like, "Yo, we should go ahead "and start this food truck business up" "I see this food truck, we can get it." She was like, "A food truck?" And he was like, "Yeah, Jamaican food." She was like, "Nah, nah, you can't start no food truck." (Jamaican music) Can we get a jerk chicken and curry chicken? Jerk chicken and curry chicken? Oh nigga you paid, it must be pay day nigga, you paid? I got you nigga, you about to be fuckin' hooked up. Hooked up. - Yo Renee. - Ah. Hey man, this nigga, he got paid today, you know what I'm talking about. Jerk chicken, curry chicken, fried chicken, feline curry, all that shit together, hook that nigga up you know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can we get some jerk chicken, some jerk chicken and some curry chicken please. Okay we're gonna get you jerk chicken. - Okay, yeah. - Okay. 50 dollars. So what you gonna do, do you still want it? Hey Flip, you didn't give me enough money dog. What you mean, I gave you 60 dollars. Nigga you gave me 20 dollars. Nigga I gave you 60 dollars, what you talking about? See that's the problem dog, you can't count. Nigga, I counted three 20's, nigga. 20, 40, 60, nigga count that. 20, 40, 60, all together. 20, 40, 60, what you doing nigga? Get your ass back here. (Flip and Renee shouting) They also started the MMA fight club. Okay, they sound more like your siblings than mine. Hey, hey, you left them with me, so. I missed you. So what time is our appointment? Few hours. Okay, so where's Flip and Renee? You ain't been listening, have you? Got it. You get Flip I'll get Renee. Ah, let me go get Renee. You go get Flip. [Kristin] What? Renee's mad at you. I would not do that. Whatever. (chilled music) Shit, KB. Hey, what up KB. Hey Flip, look who it is. Took somebody dying for you to come back. Hey Felix. You still don't drink. You still drinking. Look, I'm gonna cut all the bullshit out Kristin. I already know why you came back. Our mother is dead. All I want to do is honor her and make sure y'all are good. Our family's been dead to you for years. Okay, that's not true. - Okay. - If that were true, I wouldn't have come back. If I was a betting man I'd say that the only reason why you came back is for the money for that house. Excuse me? Oh come on now. Ain't no ring on that finger which means you ain't found what you were looking for. And what am I looking for? The same thing that nigga Lee looking for. A perfect family. Whatever. Whatever. Look, if anybody knows you Kristin, or knew you, it's me. And I'm willing to bet that if you would've went out there and found yourself a family I highly doubt that you would've come back. Ever. Still an asshole I see. I just call it like I see it. Anyway you can't sell that house 'cause I ain't got one. You still lived at home with mama, Felix? No, no, no, now I just got kicked out of my spot last week, all right? And Judy aint gonna take me back so- - You need to get it together. I could have had it together if my big sister would have never left. Okay, you are a grown ass man. Flip, if you keep it up you gonna end out on the streets. Just like your raggedy ass daddy. That's our raggedy ass daddy, Kristin. And better be like that nigga, than that nigga Vern. Vern got a house. - Don't you stand up- - Hurry up. We're gonna be late. Put it on my tab, Billy.

Oh, you mean that bitch Kristin drove herself of her little high pedestal to come down here and see us. Mama had to die for her to come back. Look, she's here. [Renee] And? And she would have wanted all four of us to be there. Hm-hmm, yeah, she would. And whose fault is it that mama never got to see that shit? That doesn't matter. It don't matter. [Renee] Okay. (man coughing) Yeah, Mm-hmm. [Lee] Oh, so you're coming? Yeah. That bitch come down here for a reason Lee. She thinks she's slick. She ain't gonna run one of them on me. Good. Oh.

Both them motherfuckers can catch my mouth. Hey, we're not here to argue sis, we're here to- - No. I'm here to argue. I'm here to argue, Lee. The only thing the two of us got to common with their ass is a damn mama, okay? That shit aint enough for me to hold my tongue - and play nice. - That's your sister. [Flip] Hey, what up, Ratchet? Yo, where your man at girl? Nigga where your girl at? Shit ain't none of your damn business. - Oh shit. - He's sleeping, peacefully. - Oh you knock him out? - Shut up. Oh night night, he went night night? Your man went night night. - He asleep, all right? - Okay he sleeping. You gotta find a better man, I'm just saying. I'm looking. I'm just saying.

No, no, no, no, no, no. We need to do this now 'cause if we don't do it, it's never gonna happen. [Mr. Luther] Okay, follow me. - Come on, go ahead. - Why am I even going? - Come and get some money man. - So stupid. I'm not gonna lie. I didn't think the four of you would make it here together, especially you. Yeah, well, I'm here. Yes you are. Just so you know, your mother specifically requested that we read this before the funeral. Does it say why? We'll understand better after I read this? If this is being read, It means the Lord has taken me home, a place think I've been looking for since I arrived here. My home is a place I tried to provide for my family but somehow I seem to always driven a wedge between them. I pray that in my death I can somehow bring them together. And somehow heal all the pain I've caused. Skip to the part where she gives a shit. Hey. What? He's doing his job. What? (Sighs) [Mr. Luther] Our family doesn't have much left but I promised my older brother, Jimmy, that I do right by him. Other than our family home, I leave to my children our old family business. Jimmy's old bar that he used to run when we were younger. He paid off the bar before he died and began paying on the land, then I took on the payments until it was paid off a few years ago. That place has so much history with our family. [Mr Luther] It'd bring me nothing but joy for them to band together and run it. That is the only condition of this. Everything goes to the kids should they agree to run everything together as a family? What the fuck was she thinking? You mean to tell me that mom had the title to uncle Jimmy's bar this whole time and ain't say nothing? Let me see that, Mr. Luther. Come on, man. Actually, we could run the shit out of that place. Nigga you can't run shit. I can run plenty of things. Man you can't even keep a drawer straight. - I can keep it straight, - You're short on everything. What, no. Remember that time when you were short $20. Don't talk about that, don't talk about that. I was short- - Hey, hey! What are y'all talking about. Before we even talk about that we gotta figure this out, man. [Mr. Luther] Yeah, you guys should talk this out and you need to decide before the funeral, before the city tries to take over. Great. Thank you Mr. Luther. Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Luther. Y'all ready for that? Hell yes. Disco strip club. Yo, that's some fire shit. I wanna go to that strip club. Disco, disco. I take it to you read that last part that says you make the final call. Yeah. Look, I know you have your own slew of problems and I know your siblings aren't the most reliable. Thanks. Just saying if it was me, I'd take the money and split. But that's just me. (chilled music) Nothing. A whole lot of nothing. Hey man Renee there aint shit in the fridge. Well maybe if you put something in it, there'd be some food. And not a drink in sight. Some family reunion. Let's just figure out what we're gonna do about this house and this bar. What you mean figure out what we, nigga we know what we gonna do with the house nigga. I get the house. We all get the bar and nigga we're straight. No. No? Oh, I'm sorry princess. Are you not trying to come off your pedestal and hang out with your siblings? No. As is out of the four of us I'm the only one that knows anything about running a successful business, and we'd fail in the first week. Wow. Kristin, you aint the only one with experience running a business. Yeah man, look, me and Renee got plenty of experience running shit, you know? Now, that nigga Lee, on the other hand, he don't mind working for the man, you know, clock-in, clock-out. Do you mean I don't mind working for a steady pay check? You right about one thing, sis, you know all about running. Here we go. Oh, so that's what we doing? When's the last time you even talked to mom? I talk to my mama all the time? Like you would even know. You lying. We all see right through you. There's money on the table and now you wanna be a part of the family and act like you care about us all of a sudden. Okay, okay. Can we just use the next two minutes to please, please do no fighting, no arguing, none of that. Take me to two minutes. Look, if we can't even sit in here and have an adult conversation then there's no way we can run a business together. So I think that's just, that's out the window. Thank you from the smart brother. What? Now, as far as the house goes, I don't know we can- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, yo, yo, yo, we ain't selling shit yo. We sell that shit man we'll be broke by Christmas, again. Hey, you spend your money on whatever you wanna spend it on. That's on you. Well, I'm buying me a boat. Yo ass ain't buying no boat. What you going to do with a boat, nothing. Let it sit there. Can't swim. You'll probably just be on the boat right down the water by yourself and girls and drinks and the sun and, ay, yo, yo, yo, yo. Buy a boat girl, we can buy a boat girl. Pull up, pull up, pull up. I'll be the captain, you be first mate but we gonna make sure that we buy and keep this bar. Felix, I can't guarantee you the bar. Nigga, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What you mean you can't guarantee the bar, nigga? You talking like you getting the final say and shit. Nigga. Bro, there's business licenses we gotta have and taxes we gotta pay and incentive. We got to actually make people want to come back into this old ass bar, man. And no, man my wife thinks I'm wasting my time messing with y'all anyway. Man, tell your wife that you wasting time if you don't do this shit, bro. I told you I got the plug on the incense, nigga. I got lavender, I got vanilla, I got cherry, (Renee laughs) I got cucumber. I got all that shit, - smelling good. - Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Did you say incense? Yeah nigga, that's what you said. Incentive, negro. Yes, incense. [Lee] Incentive. Incense. Incentive. Insensitive nigga, whatever the word is, nigga this is incense nigga, I got the plug. Okay, Felix. Felix. It wouldn't work. Man, how you know when you aint tried nothing yet? Okay. Well let's look at y'all's history of trying things. Bitch, you don't know shit about- - Okay, Renee. If you call me out of my name one more time I will knock you out. Oh, you gonna knock me out? Yes, I will knock you, - I will knock you out. - Okay, okay. Hey, no fighting in mamas house y'all. Oh, you wanna go outside? - You wanna go outside? - Come on, come on. You know what? You, ain't never gonna change. I'm out of here and I'm taking your car Leander. - I need to get me a damn car. - Wait, what? - My car? - Call me when she's gone. Let go. [Lee] That's my car though. Yeah man, she's probably just gonna wreck it. [Lee] Where are you going? [Flip] Nigga, outside. Welcome home. (phone buzzes) - Hello? - Hey Kristin. Hey Mr. Luther, what's going on? [Mr. Luther] Oh, I hope this isn't a bad time. I got some good news for you. I got a past client who might be able to make your choice easier. On the bar? [Mr. Luther] Yeah, on all of it. They made a pretty generous offer on the property. So are you going? I have to. You never really talk about your family much. You think it's gonna be weird? Paige, remember last year when I, when I left my job? Yeah, that's when your candle business took off. Well, I actually lost my job. I may have forgotten to mention a few things. What are you talking about? My mom has been helping with the bills for the last year. Wait, what? With overhead and operating expenses I'm pretty much making sleeping on someone else's couch money right now, at best. What about your company? What about your booming candle business? That was just all depending on your mom's money. So it's just done. You can't be serious. You know I sleep on your couch, right? You know you said, "Come to Charlotte, you can crash on my couch until you get up on your feet." You said that. You're not even on your feet. Paige. So what are you gonna do about all this? I'll figure it out. Kristin. I am sorry. You want me to come with you? No, I got to do this alone. Plus I have a brother and sister who will take one look and know they can steal from you. Sweet. You got a brother and sister? (train rattling) (ball bouncing) (Flip grunts) (knocking) (phone buzzes) [Woman] Flip, get up. Oh, man. (knocking) [Woman] I'm serious man, wake up. Man, hold on. Goddamn. (knocking) Nigga, what up? [Lee] Hey man, you busy? No man. I'm chilling bro. It's good. [Lee] It's mom man. (knocking) It's mom, mom- What? (knocking) [Lee] She died Flip. She's gone. (knocking) [Woman] Flip- - I don't know what to do man. - Would you shut the fuck, I'm dealing with some real life emotional shit right now. Calm down. [Woman] Come on, open up the door. Man I'm gonna open up a can of whoop ass on your ass. You good? [Lee] I don't know. I just left the hospital. You good? Flip? Yeah, I'm good. You told your daddy? [Lee] No man, I ain't even thought about that shit yet. I'll talk to his ass. [Lee] Hey man, don't even worry about that, bro. Just, just come over here and get up with me when you can, man. - Okay. (knocking) I'll call you back. Man, what you want? You gotta go, my dad booked the room. What you mean booked the room? Flip, you gotta go. Give me five minutes man. Okay, one minute. All right. (suspenseful music) (car beeping) (suspenseful music continues) (Flip claps hands) You should consider locking your door, fool. What are you doing here? My mama died. I came here to tell you. Yeah, I know. I got to call a few hours ago. I'm sorry, son. I aint your damn son. Loretta, God bless that woman. What happened to her? Hey, hey, hey, don't act like you care. Don't act like you care about my mama, bro. All that matters is your parasitic ass can't use her no more. I don't want to see your ass at no funeral, nigga. Felix, hell no! Come here. You got some damn nerve coming up in my house making demands like you a man. But you know what? You right. Your mother was a saint. And you, you and your siblings that's what made it worse on her? Hey, hey, hey, nigga, what the fuck you just say? I'll bust that ass, I'll bust, nigga. Vern, I'll bust that ass, nigga, right now. Right now. And you got exactly what you want. A nice house, none of us in it. But that shit don't make you a man. Now I already bust that ass once. You know what your problem is, Felix? I always tried to be a father. You never tried to be a son. So what we gonna do, huh? What you gonna do now, kill me? Send me to an early grave, like how you did to mother. Man, you have lost your Goddamn mind. You must be out your Goddam mind, Vern. I'll kill you! I don't want to see your ass at no funeral. 'Cause if I do it's on sight. The only reason I aint show up here before is 'cause mama was around. And she aint here no more. [Vern] And why isn't she here, Felix, huh? Why isn't she here? You think that gun make you look big, huh? You a gangster now? Is that what your mother wanted? Huh? You know what? You wish you had this big ass house but you don't and you can't, you know why? 'Cause you a bum. - You a broke ass bum. - Get the fuck away from me, nigga. [Vern] That's right. Get the fuck outta here before I call the cops on your sorry ass. (ball bouncing) (banging) (ball bouncing) You see which way she go? Nah bro. You take my car at least or something? Yeah man, it's gonna blow off a little bit more steam. What are you doing, bro? You trying to tear the goal off? You've got to aim before you shoot the ball, man. That's not right. Woo. Okay, good shot. Just like I taught you boy. What? Come on man, exchange. I don't know how you let her drive off with my ride, man. Man, that's your car, why is that on mean? And how do you acting surprised? Like you don't know I'm the most athletic in the family. Ooh, oh, oh. Yeah boy. Yes you all that. Me. Dolo, Flip, all that baby. That's all me. - Whatever man. - Just like I taught you boy. - Skills. - Right. - Right. - Skills. So what's up with this bar man? I'm saying man, shit kind of feels right. I'm on my own, I've tried and failed shit like this so many damn times, man. More times than you know. Clearly I can't do this shit by myself. Mama knew that. Damn, bro. Plus, I telling you I got all the plugs on the incense, nigga, boxes of that shit, nigga. Stop, stop, stop, stop. - Take that out of your mouth. - I mean stacks, stacks of incense. Listen, take that out of your mouth right now. Okay? Incense can't help this bar, but incentive will. Say it with me. - Incen-tive - Incen-tive. You said it by yourself. I got it, yeah. Shit that's what I'm talking about boy, you smart now, you smart man. Man, that's what I'm saying, bro. And you ain't the only one, bro. You got some smart, strong women as sisters bro that's all I'm trying to say. I mean way smarter and stronger than our dumb assess. That's the real gift mama gave us. A chance to have a real family. Not that fairytale bullshit your ass be after. What are you talking about? Nigga, let's spit facts, nigga, the fairytale bullshit. You've got the fairytale bullshit. Those aren't facts bro. Nigga, it's facts, bro. All you do is look for the perfect life. I'm not looking for a perfect life, Flip. I'm just looking for a normal life. Nigga, what's normal, huh? Not what we have. And do we got, huh? Character, yeah, yep. We've got, we all grew up in the same house, dealt with the same shit, we got history, nigga. What are you talking about? You're acting like I don't know that. Nigga, you acting like you don't know that, bro. Man, you and Kristin be walking around here with your heads hung low and acting like y'all missing something in life, man. What y'all missing, bro? It's us. What are you talking about us now for? Nigga, me and Renee's crazy asses bro. Man, move man. - No come on man. - Move. Nah, no look, man. As soon as Kristin got into town, bro, man, she seemed like she had everything all just put well together, man. But does she look happy to you, man? Does she look actually happy to you, man? 'Cause I know happy and that shit ain't it. I know, I know you see that shit. I know you know exactly what I'm talking about, man. All right? You and Kristin can use some of this hustle me and Renee got. I don't want none of your hustle, Flip. Your hustle's gotten you what? Excuse me nigga, what you saying? No, bro, I mean, you be out here hustling taking Renee along with you and just messing her life up, bro. And you know she got problems, Flip. You know that bro. Problems that you not helping with. I'm trying to give our sister a chance. A chance? A chance at what? A chance to hurt herself. A chance to get into some more trouble, lose more stuff. Or you know she's the only one that's gonna give you a chance. Oh you tripping, dog. Nah, bro. You need to hear this. You are the epitome of damn homie, in high school you was the man, homie. What the fuck happened to you? You could have been anything you wanted to be, Flip. You was the one. And now look at you. Judy then kicked you out again. And now you're trying to move into mom's house and mess that all up. That's why you have a problem with Vern. 'Cause he would calling you out on your bullshit. Ah no, I got a problem with Vern 'cause he used to beat y'all's asses every day. Remember that shit? Do you remember that? Yes man, I remember that, but you must have selective memory, okay? Sure, he was a very disciplined man but we ain't never seen your dad. Where's he at? You just being a dick right now, ain't you? You just being a dick ass nigga right now, ain't you? How about this, how about, I know I can find my dad. I met my dad, how about that? I can find my dad whenever the fuck I want to on corner of Central and Park - whenever I want. - All right, all right. Now don't talk about shit you don't know about bro. Okay, okay, man. Why are you acting like everything's so good bro? Like what is there to be happy about? We alive, Lee. We alive. You call this living? I had to watch mom die, remember? Me. I was the one there and I got to watch out for Renee too, because nobody else is. And I got my own family to watch out for, man. So you call that living? Just 'cause I ain't taking care of them the way that you wanted me to take care of them doesn't mean I ain't taking care of them, man. How are you taking care of anything? By not being so Goddamn grim all the time, bro. Whenever I was around mama, we was having a great time, man. I had mama laughing, laughing, all right? We had a good time smiling man whenever me and Renee around we having a good time, we laughing, we fight sometimes man, but whenever you bring your rank loud ass around Lee it's just woe is me and we gotta worry about this and we had to worry about that. Right. And I'm sorry that I'm such a horrible brother that I want my family to get their life together and be happy and read a book and stop drinking and smoking all the time, which I should have known was a horrible idea from the fucking beginning considering what I'm dealing with. I can get my own car, man. Hey man, Lee. Lee. What are you doing? Look, man, at the end of the day, man, running this bar might be the best chance we've got to having a perfect family, man. And even if it's not perfect, man, it's the best chance we got of having a whole one. (ball bouncing) Hey Leander, what the hell you doing out here? Hey wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Who did that to you? Dad. Vern hit you? Can you teach me how to fight? Did he? He just said I needed to be tougher. Really? Look, Vern is a bad man, okay? A bully. And the quickest way to get rid of a bully's power is to hit him in the face. He's my dad, Flip. Dad's ain't supposed to hit you. Come on. Swing at my hands. Just like those Kung Fu movies you be watching, come on. Okay, ow, ow, ow, okay. You're gonna break my hand off. Another thing that you need to work on is aiming and then shooting. Your ass be getting too excited on the court just throwing the ball. Let's see your shot. Watch this shit. [Lee] Nice shot. Whatever. Hey, do wanna hang out. Sure, what are we doing? First I'm gonna introduce you to my bros and they'll teach you how to fight. Whatever. You know what? Maybe you're right. What'd you say? I said maybe you're right. I'm right. Shut up. No, I'm right. - You said I'm right. - No, nevermind. You said I'm right. Lee said I'm right. Lee said I'm right. [Instructor on phone] May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be faithful. Hey. Hey. Hey, you gotta go get your, you got, What? You gotta go get your sister. Why me? Look because if none of this works out we don't know when you coming back. So while you here you should go make good with your sister. Okay, so why me again? 'Cause you gotta be the first one to make the move. - She ain't gonna do it. - Right. - Right. - No. Look just, can you go get my car please? This wouldn't have happened if you did what you did. Okay. I'm getting your precious car and then I'm outta here. You don't gotta leave. Where the hell do I even look? It's either her house or liquor store or something. She's probably moping around her building, looking for somebody to buy her something from the liquor store. Exactly. I'm taking your car Leander. Hey, hey, y'all, what y'all doing, what y'all doing? Y'all sitting there talking like that aint our sister. She got problems y'all. I'll be back. My bad, man. That was, Yeah. That was kinda messed up. Y'all tripping, man. You think you know everything, don't you Kristin? You think you know everything, huh? You don't. You just want to see how fucked up my life is, don't you? You just wanna laugh in our faces. We don't need you. I don't need you. Lee doesn't need you. I'm sorry about that. Johnny ain't gonna be here. He ain't coming back. Everything's going good at work. I've got my lights on. You want some coffee? So you're employed now? [Renee] Hm-hmm. Good, where? I work at a club. A club? Yeah. This club have a manager? Hm-hmm. [Ms. Barringer] What's his name? Huh? What's his name? Oh, some little white boy named Alex. How much are you making? It's commission-based. Commission? Yeah, we sell stuff to the people outside that might be interested. Outside the club? Yeah, girl. I'll be out there selling juices and shit, stuff. Have you been using drugs? No drugs. Still working on cutting back on the alcohol but all in all I feel good. I just miss my kids. Did I pass your test? I'm sorry, Renee. I would never get approval for these living conditions. What do you mean? Renee, I really want you to have your kids back, but you can't keep having your boyfriend or whoever here and reek of alcohol. That kind of drinking and domestic abuse is not a suitable living environment for children. My office will say that you're too unstable to be a mother. I don't really give a damn about what your office has to say about me. Well, you need to, because it is a huge contributing factor to getting those kids out of the system and you regaining custody. The courts can give you another 30 days. (Renee bangs fist) 30 days. No. No, Ms Barringer, please help me. Helping those children is my top priority. Show us you can maintain a healthy living situation and control your anger, and you'll have your kids back. And please, no more excuses. Bitch. ♪ I'm John with the stick Madden ♪ ♪ Went and did my thing slid away like Aladdin ♪ Erin. Erin, Erin, Erin, Erin, Erin. What's up girl? Hey, can you get me a job? Renee. I'm sorry, I can't. Come on, Erin. You didn't even try. Why are you here, what do you want? Look, I gotta find me a real job, but nobody will hire me. That's because everybody's fired you. Dude, that shit aint my fault. All right, it's discrimination, it's the shit I was telling you about a week ago. Why don't... Everybody's, I mean, why don't you go back to the call centers? Man, hell no, man. Yo, if I go back to one of them damn centers I'll kill a motherfucker. Well you practically killed somebody the other night that you were here - the last time. - Come on. See I almost drug a bitch through this motherfucking parking lot, and knocked her little ass out. That's what the fuck I do, - you know that shit? - Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that bitch said I fucked her order man, that bitch was wrong. Okay, well, I gotta get back. I'm sorry, I've got like seven tables, I'm sorry about your mom by the way. Hey, yo, what the fuck you say by my mama? Ay, yo, Erin, fuck you. This is some bullshit. (Kristen knocking) It's me. Can I come in? (Renee sighs) You okay? Fucking perfect, can't you tell? Okay, Renee, you don't always have to be so confrontational. I'm not. Yes you are. I got a right to be angry. Okay, well just 'cause you got a right to be don't mean you gotta be. Why after all these years do you choose now to care, Kris? Hmm? Hmm? I've always cared, Renee. I just couldn't stay in this toxic environment. Do you remember the last thing you said to us before you left? You're a waste, a complete waste and you're never gonna amount to anything. That's what you said about me and Felix. And then you have the nerve to go and tell Lee that if he was smart, he should get out too. - Renee. No. Fuck that. That shit hurt, Kris and the timing was horrible too. Mama was already sick. Barely there. Dad was a monster and never there. And through all that shit all I wanted was to be with you. And then you abandoned us. You saw us struggling and you abandoned us. I had to live my life, Renee. If I would've stayed here, I... What? Been stuck taking care of us? Yes. I didn't want that. Why would anybody want that? Plus y'all were grown, what did you want me to do? Grown? We was barely grown then, Kris, and we pretending to be grown now, we're fucking broken. Okay, and what was I supposed to do? Huh, just give up and live in the brokenness. No, I had to get out and find something better. Well, you've been gone a long fucking time, Kris enough time for somebody to find something better. You find it? How can you fault me for that? Renee, You, Felix and Lee are the most important things to me - in my entire life. - Hm-hmm. Hm-hmm. Listen, I've said some horrible things. Yeah. And I'm sorry. I am so sorry, Renee. But life for me had to change. What, what is so bad about that, huh? Oh, Kristin wants to grow so fuck her. We never said that shit. You might as well have. Y'all been dissing me since I got here and all I went out and did was look for something more in life. Instead of the same senseless, dangerous shit I had been doing. Look, I'm not proud of it, but I'm for damn sure not mad about it either. I went from working for this asshole, misogynistic, punk motherfucker, to starting and running my own candle business. And even though it is currently burning because I actually suck at selling candles, I'm proud of it. The things I've learned and the people I've met have changed my life. (Renee laughs) Are you seriously laughing right now? No, no, no. Look, I'm not laughing at you. You said, you said your candle business was burning and I'm just like, ain't that what it's supposed to do? (Kristen laughs) It's a fucking candle, bitch. (Renee and Kristen laugh) - Okay. - Oh my God. Oh God. It aint that funny. (laughs) Damn. You just like the rest of us. Shut up. Shit makes sense. We all grew up together. (Renee sobs) What's wrong with you? You're an auntie. What? Yeah, I got two little girls. Okay, Renee, what are you talking about? I got two little girls, but I don't. The city came and took them and put them in the system. Renee, what are you talking about? I have fucked it up, Kris. How do you lose custody of your kid? I'm an aunt? Yeah, bitch. I told you not. Renee, what are you gonna do? I gotta stop fucking up. Find me a real job and just get my shit together. I'm sorry. [Young Kristen] Renee. I should have told you. [Young Kristen] Renee. You're my sister. [Young Kristen] Renee. Damn. [Young Kristen] Renee. [Kristen] Two little babies out there. Hm-hmm. Against the world. Just like you and me. Renee. Renee, what are you doing? You know mama would raise hell. So don't tell her then. What up shawty, this your sister? Renee, come on or I will tell her. Just hang with us, Kris. We're just chilling and getting fucked up as usual (laughs). Okay, fine, coming. God, Jesus. Yo, where you going? We was chilling. Tell your sister, turn up or turn her ass on outta here. Don't be talking to my sister like that, okay? Y'all must've, Y'all must've what, huh? Lost our damn minds? Man, fuck you hoes. Get the fuck from round here. See? I'm good, girl. I'm about as safe here as I am at home with daddy. At least he showed me how to stab somebody. You've got us at home, Renee. You're barely home, Kristin. That don't mean we can't hang out at other places. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm good with what I got. You just need to learn to loosen up a little, Kris. Okay? Renee? - Renee? - Yeah? I'm glad we were able to talk. Everything's gonna be okay. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. What's good, y'all trying to come over to the bar or what? Get out. Get out. That's it, right. Hey man, come on man. Hey man don't break the shit. (upbeat music) Let's see if we can find some light up in here. Yeah. - Hey. - Damn. Shit y'all, we got us a little spot, y'all. Come on. - For real. - Mom had this all this time. (plastic crackling) Mama just let me and Felix fail at scheme after scheme, she aint say shit about this place. This place is definitely dusty as hell. The back door about broke, - so we got to get that fixed. - Oh hell yeah. Oh, that's a rat. - Ah ah. - Ah ah, I got it, I got it. You got it? Ew, with your bare hands. You better make sure you wash your hands. That's why your ass always sick. Oh yeah, and I got some liquor. Ay! Serve me a drink, bartender. Renee. What? I'm just- - [Flip] Hey, yo, Kristen. What up? You remember the old record player mama had back then? - Oh yeah the record player. - No I found one. It's here, come on now. They used to have it jammin' back there in the days. Oh! Play something y'all. Will somebody pour me a drink girl, come on. I appreciate that. There you go. There we go, let's see. I even got something for you little big sis. Look. No liquor in here. - [Flip] It still works. (claps hands) - Yo, put something on it. - Hey. - Hey, hey. - Ayyy. There we go. Hey, hey. Hey, yo Kris, y'all remember the Funky Granny, you just go like this. Ah ha, ah, oh. Okay. - Then you break your back. - Come over here girl, what you doing, girl? That's not how, that's not how you- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Now listen, aint nobody Funky Granny like I can Funky Granny like this, ah, ah, ah, Ah. Walk and walk. - Go, go. - Oh, oh, sweat. - Ooh. - See y'all still messing it up, man. That's not how you supposed to do it. Hold this, hold this, hold that. The problem is you gotta remember the ass gotta be out like this. You know what I'm talking about, sis. - You gotta throw the ass out. - Oh yeah. Then get the walker. The steps in my feet, watch me move. I'm watching you Lee. - 'Cause your bones is weak. - Ay, ay. Your bones is weak. Shake it like uncle Jimmy. - Ay, ay, ay. - Just like uncle Jimmy. Yo, Kristin! Get your ass up in this line girl. (Kristin and Flip talking over each other) First of all y'all starting in the middle of the dance floor. Granny starts off with confidence, okay? - Okay. - You gotta give granny her confidence. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. - Ay. - That's right. Ay! And then you hurt your back. Yo baby get my walker. (others cheering) Get my walker. (all cheering) (upbeat music) (Renee cheering) (upbeat music) (all chatting) He be playing too much, he be playing. (Flip and Renee bickering) Vodka! I don't drink, I drink water. Vodka. I think the light is perfect. Hey, y'all, you ready? - Hi. - One, two, three, this is, - Ay. - This is the fam, son. The Baker family. - Hey, we back. - The Baker family. We back. (upbeat music) Oh God. What we calling this place? Felix's Spot. Nigga, hell no. That's the lamest shit I ever heard. Hey nigga you lame as hell, nigga. What you talking about? Felix's Spot's a dope ass name for that shit. What else we gonna call it, huh? How about this, how about this. Why don't we just ask the lamest person in the room? Lee. Mr. Leroy lame boy. - What? (Felix and Renee laugh) Why am I lame? [Flip] Nigga, you the lamest one in the room. Who's lamer than you? Who's lamer than me out of all of us four? - Yeah. - You really wanna know who's lamer than me. Oh damn. That's cold sis, he called you lame. Okay Lee, I'm lame how? Look sis, I don't make the rules. I just live by it, okay? But now that you mentioned it, the name Felix's isn't actually too stupid. - Nah. - It's like three stupid. Right. It's like such a dumb name that it sticks. (Renee and Lee laugh) [Flip] Ha, ha, ha, ha. Okay, can we get back to how I am the lamest one here? Yeah, let's get back to what you drinking on. Okay, being healthy does not make me lame, okay? Aah, y'all better leave my sister alone. Oh y'all cool now? - Hm-hmm. - Ah ha. So cool. - Ooh. - So cool. Oh, okay. What is this? These are called shots. They were invented back in George Washington days. - Okay. - Here, here, here. - Shut up smart ass. - No, you take it. Shot, shot, take a shot, shot, shot, shot. No, I am not. - Shot, shot, shot, shot. - Shot, shot, shot, shot. Take a shot, take a shot, shot Shot, shot Shot Kristen. - Here you go. - Thank you sis. All right. All right, all right, all right. What are we cheers-ing to? To Felix's Spot. Felix's Spot. How about we do it to family? Look, our mom might not have been a perfect mom, but hey, she obviously loved us 'cause she hooked us up with uncle Jimmy's spot, so. And it's more than just a, than just a business and a new bar and all of that. This is to family. To family. Family. (upbeat music) - Hm. - Hm-hmm. (Kristin coughs) You are fine, there was barely an liquor in that. Shut up, that was gross. (Lee laughs) [Flip] Tastes like Asprin. [Loretta] You not hungry? No I ate earlier. [Loretta] Bullshit, your stomach's been growling since you got here. Why don't you come sit down and get something to eat. I'm okay, mom. [Loretta] Eat boy. Hmm. You can't be around here moping like that, Leander. You're supposed to be mama's ray of sunshine. I know mama, I know. I'm serious now. Life is too short for you to go around moping like that. And just because your wife can't have kids doesn't mean that you can't. - What? - What? Vivian can have kids. Hm. Hm-hmm. Look, I just came over here to bring you a little snack to eat because Felix got kicked out of his spot. So I'm sure he gonna be here at any second to come clean your refrigerator. That's what it's here for, boy, okay? I love you, mom. See you when I get off work, okay? Take your meds please. Thank you. See you later. Lee? Yes, ma'am. I know when my children aren't happy. Aren't happy? Trust me, 'cause none of y'all are. Except maybe that boy Felix, comfortable being comfortable. You gotta be more like your sister, Kristin, and get out of your comfort zone. Ma, Kristin left. She left. Leave your sister alone. I'll see you later, mom. (suspenseful music) (Lee knocks punching bag) (Lee grunts) Have a good day hat work, hon. You too, honey. Hey, Viv? Yeah? I was talking to my mom yesterday. Okay. She says I'm unhappy. What does that mean to you? What are you talking about, baby? I don't know. Well, are you unhappy? I don't think so. You don't think so? Is work stressing you out? You know, sometimes I feel like I don't even know what I'm working for. Maybe you working for the amazing wife that you're trying to keep happy. Hey stop now, who said you was amazing? - Listen. - That wasn't me - It wasn't me. - You said it. - Stop, no. - You said it when you married me. You right, you are right. Are you happy? I'm only as happy as you are, hon. But, we both gonna have to be happy if we're still planning on trying to have this baby. I got an appointment with the doctor next week. That's wonderful. I'm happy that I'm with you. Okay. You have a good day. Call me if anybody dies. [Man on radio] I've had moments where I doubted myself but the one time that I'll never forget that it worked out for me best was I was riding in my car and I was stopped at a stop light and I looked at the stop light and said, if I go through you then I'm gonna have to go to this job that I've been working nine to five, Monday through Friday for the past 20 years. That's not what living is about. Living is about taking control of your own life and doing what you wanna do for yourself, your family and everything that you love, okay? Do what you love and grab life by the horns. (sad piano music) Ma? Ma? Ma? Ma, you in the bathroom? Ma? Ma! (raindrops falling) What's up? You good? Yeah, I'm good. You good? I think so. You know, if I had a million dollars I would have lost all of it betting that we would be up in here together. (Laughs) I mean, look at us. [Kristin] Yeah. I think we all would have lost that bet. Yeah. (Laughs) I'm glad you stayed, Lee. What? I said, I'm glad you stayed. They needed you. No, they didn't need me. They're obviously fine on their own. Nah, it would have been a lot worse if they didn't have someone who actually believed in them. Yeah, maybe you're right. Me and Vivian, my wife, she and I were talking and we're thinking about adopting Renee's kids for the time being. You know, while we can. Really? - Yeah, yeah. - I mean that's, that's something. (Lee and Kristin laugh) I know, I know. Go ahead, I'm the man and all that good stuff, I know. (Kristin laughing) I don't mean to overstep but honestly I thought you would have had kids of your own by now. I mean you are married and you seem to be settled into life here. No, trust me. I thought so too. It's okay. You know, Flip pulled a gun on Vern yesterday. What? Hm-hmm. Threatened him, told him not to come to the funeral. Okay, well I'm assuming you talked to Vern. Yeah, yeah. I called him this morning. What did he say? Sounds like he's about to leave town. Scared Flip's gonna try to kill him? Hey, you catch your brother Flip on a bad day, especially now that mom is not here no more. But, you know, I get it. Vern probably feels guilty for not being there for mom, you know? Especially when she needed it. No matter how big that house is. And how are you feeling about all of this? He's my dad, you know? So, regardless if I think he's a monster or not, that's just what it is. And if him getting out of town keeps Flip from hurting him then so be it, right? I'm glad he's getting out of here because if Flip would've caught him and did anything then I'd have to whip Flip's ass. - (Lee laughs) - Lee, shut up. (Laughs) Well, I think that's it for me. And I'm gonna go into the back and find something to fall asleep on, so. Be my guest, go right ahead. Yeah. Buddy. Treat yourself. (phone buzzes) (police knocking) (police knocking) - (police knocking) - Police, police! - Police knock. - Hide the shit. What shit? - Huh? (police knocking) I'll go see who it is. (police knocking) Morning. You all know you've been squatting? Squatting? The owners called this morning, wanted me to check the place out, thought someone might be living in there. Y'all been trespassing. No, no, we're not trespassing this is our bar. Oh I see. Do you have some ID? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, this property belongs to John Taylor. He's the one that called to make sure everyone was out. - Nah, that's- - Hey, yo, Kristin man, - wake your ass up. - No, I don't think that can be right. Hey! What the fuck's going on out there? What? Get your ass up, somebody's there. Renee, let's go. All right, hold on, just hold up. Hold up. Okay, so hold on because I'm like a little drunk and still kinda drunk. What's going on? Look, I just need to make a phone call, okay? To who? To the person she sold our bar to. Felix, shut the fuck up, man. She didn't sell the bar. Yo, we didn't even come to an agreement yet, Kris. Yo, did you read that sheet of paper? 'Cause I ain't read that sheet of paper, all right. Clearly she knows something we ain't supposed to know. She would have never left. Mom probably wouldn't have been gave us that spot. Okay, look, I messed up. Okay? I messed up. When I made that decision we were at each other's throats, okay? And all I need to do is call Mr.Luther to see if we can at least get the house back. Get the house back? You sold the house. Oh Kristin, you sold the house. Come on, man! Come on, man! Man, that's my house. Flip. Yo, Kris, you a bitch. Hey, y'all, wait up. I deserved that. I deserved that. Mr. Luther, this is Kristin. I don't know what I need to do but I'll, please I'll do anything, but I need to make sure that we can get the house back and the bar, if we can. Call me back.

(congregation clapping) God bless you children. Hi, everybody. Thank you all for coming out here today for, for my mother. My name is Lee and we are the Baker family. Me and my mom, we used to, we used to, It's okay. Sorry. Sorry, y'all. That's the baby of the family. Lee was chosen to be the one to speak today because he's mama's baby and he never left her side, but I did. I left for a lot of reasons and sometimes it takes leaving to know what you're missing out on. Now no family is perfect. And my family is the perfect example of that. My mother put up with a lot. She put up with a whole lot and I used to hate her for it. I used to wonder why she put up with all the things she did. I used to wonder why she'd sit around it and, It's okay. One thing Loretta Baker did more than anything was try to keep me and my siblings together. She knew the life she was giving us wasn't perfect, but she also knew that the four of us could lean on each other and stay strong through all the hell we were going through. Without my mama, I wouldn't have my siblings. And now without her, they're all I've got. Thank you. (gospel music) (congregation sings) [Loretta] I pray that in my death I can somehow bring them together. And somehow heal all the pain I've caused.

Listen, Paige, I know that the last few months have been hard and I haven't been my best self but I just want to let you know that I'm doing better, a lot better now. And things are going well for me and my family. And I really want to let you know that I do value your friendship. Paige: Awwww, I love you to Kris... Paige: Thanks A lot for everything.

You thought you killed Felix- I was gonna say big head. My head aint that big. Look, it's more than four, so if it's more - then it's a big head. - It is more than four. Shut up. If you measure it, technically, you know, it's a five head. What is he talking about? [Lee] So believe it or not it was actually Felix's idea to bring Felix's back. He made the logo, brought it over to Renee and she was like yo, yo, - that shit is dope. - That shit is dope. - Get your ass in here. - Get your ass in here. They went over to her house and got the (door slams) He looked at her was like, "Yo, what we should do is take all that money back "from what we got from the house" "and we need to put that into the bar and get the bar back" and it blew her mind, you should've seen her face. She was like, "Yo, that's the smartest thing I ever heard you say, "you really be reading books and stuff. "Now I'm proud of you, big bro, I'm proud of you". And he was like, "Yo, yo, yo, for real though, "you know who'd be real, real proud of us? "Who really proud". And she already knew, my ass. I mean, Lee's ass. So they came banging on my door at the house and I wasn't doing nothing, I was just chilling, not excited. They showed me the logo and I was like, bro I'm not sure- - [Flip] Nigga what you talking about, bro, nigga you was hype as hell for that whole shit nigga, when we brought that shit, you got hyped as hell. Start rubbing your chin, you was wearing your wife's shirt, nigga was looking all cute. And you were like, "Ooh, yeah, I don't like this", "I love this." [Lee] What? [Flip] Yeah nigga, that's what said. Nigga must be delirious, bro. I had nothing to do - with these logos. - I saw you. You loved it. - Nigga. - I'm trying to tell you. [Flip] Ratchet tell this nigga. Lee, get to the point. Right. So we may have an opportunity to get the bar back but under one condition. Okay. Thank you, but no thank you. It just makes me feel good to know that you guys are good and you don't need me to run a bar. Okay? (Flip and Renee laughing) Man, you think we need you, nah girl. Look man, the one condition is that it's more monetary. You know, monetary. We see, we all put in money out of our money. We just thought that you could put in some of your money into the pile so we can hook it back up. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying. We ain't trying to spend all our money. Okay. Well, you guys have been here for about five minutes or so and you haven't even checked out my candles, haven't purchased a candle, - sniff a candle. - I was looking at that stuff. Oh man girl, that's what we doing here. Purchased a candle. That's what you're here for? Yeah homie, Carimdy, that's my favorite flavor. - Exactly. - Flavor? - That's my company name. - That's the name. Sis, look, sis, at least just be a business partner, that's honestly all I'm asking. I mean, you could stay here in your new little studio and it's it's all good. Man, she ain't trying to move around man. All she's trying to do, man is move around, Mrs smooth Mover, you know what I'm saying? Do a few tricks, make some hard decisions. You know what I'm saying? Oh, well shit. If she don't make a move I'd like to see him move me around from wall to wall if you know what I mean. Chill, man you better get that nigga move around. Hey, you really gonna leave me with this? You'll be okay. You're gonna be okay. You'll be fine. Well at least come visit your family. Of course, yeah. But now come take a look at this art piece. It's by this artist named Lucille, come on. Come on, come on, - come on, come on. - I love this one, right over here. [Kristin] No. It's this one right here. It reminds me of Felix. (all chatting) [Kristin] Lord you for reuniting our family. Thank you for letting us find peace and forgiveness. Stop, give it, give it, give it. Oh my gosh! And thank you for blessing us with a mother who laid the foundation for us to see that we are stronger together. And Lord Jesus, up in heaven, thank you Father for blessing Renee's food.
