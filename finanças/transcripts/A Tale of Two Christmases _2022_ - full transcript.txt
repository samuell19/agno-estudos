Taxi! Whoa... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoo! It's okay. It's all good. Oh, wait, wait! Taxi! Taxi! Oh! Sorry. Okay... Good morning! I made it! It's done. So this is why you're seven hours late. Yeah. I stayed up all night working on it so it would be... just... perfect. Cool! Wow, that's a lot of snow. Yeah, well, I thought it could use a light Chicago snowfall to put the clients in the Christmas mood. But the model is for a golf clubhouse in Miami. - It's a lot, isn't it? - Yeah. Okay... Shoot, it's not coming off. It's too sticky. Why did you make it sticky? So it would stick! You have five minutes to get this to Mr. Heaton in time for his pitch. No, I have... 35 minutes. I padded the time in case there were any issues. The washroom! Excuse us! - Hey. - Hi! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas! When are you gonna talk to him? You've said hi a million times. Hey, focus, Holly. Are you sure about this? Maybe you should just re-do it? What? No. There's no time. You know what Mr. Heaton's like with deadlines! Okay. Yeah. Here goes. Oh, no. - Oh, no, no, no, no. - It's fine, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. You know how many hours that took me One bad decision and my whole life takes a nose dive. I really thought this was going to be the one. There will be others. Six years I've been doing renovations. Emma. Mr. Heaton! It's three o'clock. I didn't see your model out there. Yeah... about that... We had just, like, sort of a small situation, and, um, the model's not ready to show the clients. I hope this isn't the equivalent of my dog ate my homework? Um, I'm just gonna... I gotta... Bye! Holly, don't! Don't go! I just have to fix a couple things. Could I get it to you first thing in the morning? Oh, no. That's a no-go. We're having dinner with the clients to work on it. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. Yeah... Believe me, I know. I mean, um... I... I understand... Mr. Heaton. Shame. I really liked the concept. It sounded promising. Well, enjoy your Christmas, Emma. Hi, Dad. Hey, Peanut. Hey, how'd your design pitch go? Uh, good. Yeah, um... Well, I followed our motto, "Shoot for the moon." Yeah, "so you don't aim too low and lose a toe." Yeah, that's right. That's me. Still got all my toes. Hey, who is that? Oh, yeah. Guess who stopped by to help with the Christmas lights? - Drew. - Hi, Emma. Drew. Hey. Here, take the phone. Oh, Drew's also gonna help us get ready for the Christmas Eve party, too. Yeah, well, that's what neighbors are for. Hey, how's the ski lodge? It's great. We are busy. Fully booked for the holidays. That's amazing. Wow. Yeah. Oh, hey, Mrs. Roberts is finally renovating the place and she's looking for an architect, so I threw your name in the hat. Aw, well, thank you, but you didn't have to do that. I mean, Chicago isn't exactly a quick trip to Vermont. Oh, yeah! Mom also convinced him to make his Yule log again this year. Yes, although this year, I'm trying something new. Big. Savory. Okay, well, Yule logs are meant to be sweet. Not savory. Okay, listen, Perfect Peterson, there are no rules when it comes to Yule logs. Well, it's not a rule, it's just common sense. Since when? Hey, come on, you've got to help me with these lights. We're gonna see you tomorrow, Peanut. Bye-bye! Okay, bye, Dad. How do I stop it? Yule logs... are meant to be sweet. Right? Oh! I am so sorry. No worries. I needed a pick-me-up. That was better than an espresso shot. I'm Emma by the way. - I work at... - Griffith and Gomez. You're an architect, right? Yeah. It's hard to miss a golf clubhouse going into a ladies' washroom. Right. Yeah... that didn't end so well. That's too bad. I thought the snow was a nice touch. Really? Yeah, it makes sense. It's Christmas. My mom was actually an architect. She was analytical, creative, logical. I admire the profession. And you are an attorney? Yes. Max Bancroft. I'm actually a partner at Lewis and Locks. A partner, wow. Well, hopefully, you're not the kind that sues people for crashing into them. No. No, no, no. Environmental law. If you've got a short-eared owl that needs protection, I am your guy. How... altruistic. You should see the feathers fly in court. Well, it was really nice officially meeting you. Nice to meet you. Happy Holidays. Okay. Hey, Emma? This might sound kind of crazy, but I'm hosting a Christmas Eve party tomorrow night. Just some old law school friends and neighbors with no place to go. If you're interested. I'm... I'm actually flying home tomorrow morning. Right. Right. Yule logs. Yeah. That's a shame. Some other time, then. Okay. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Why, thank you. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Why, thank you, young lady. And what would you like me to bring you for Christmas this year? Uh... I don't know. Maybe for something to work out in my life for once. Ooh, tall order. Anything specific? No... You know, I get so close to what I want, and then it just doesn't happen. Maybe things happen the way they're meant to... you just gotta believe. Yeah, maybe. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! So, he really saves short-eared owls? Yes! He ticks literally every box on my list. He is... smart, he's driven. Cute... He's so cute! And... he saves birds. Was that really on your list? Well, not the birds exactly, but... it shows that he has a kind heart, and that is number one. Plus... he asked me out! Finally! Well, I mean... It's not like I can go anyway. It's tomorrow. I won't be here. Your parents wouldn't mind if you missed the Christmas Eve party. All I wanted to do was tell my Dad that I landed the project, but... I definitely cannot miss the annual party. What do you want to do? I wish I could go away with you. The sun and no stress... It sounds amazing. To you. I'm going to be one big freckle, the way I burn. Oh, wait, that reminds me. I got you something. Okay. Hang on. Here! Open it. I didn't know we were getting each other gifts! It's to protect you from the sun while you're sipping out of a coconut. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Thank you. I wish I didn't have to go home tomorrow. What time is it? Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no! Oh! Taxi! Please stop, please stop! Yes! Okay! Can you go any faster? I can't move. Okay. I'm just gonna walk. Thank you! Sorry. Excuse me. - Oh! - Oh, dear. Oh, dear. - I'll get it. I'll get it. - I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Okay... Thank you, my dear. May all your Christmas wishes come true! I slept through my alarm! I'm so glad I made it. Yeah... sorry... we just closed the doors 10 seconds ago. But the plane's still here? Sorry, once we close the doors, we can't re-open them. Are you serious? Serious as Santa on Christmas Eve. Oh... Emma, it's Bob Heaton. The clients weren't happy with what they saw, so you've got until noon to get me this model. And Merry Christmas! Hi! I slept through my alarm! I'm so glad I made it. It's your lucky day. We were just about to close the doors. Have a good flight. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! I love my job. Dad! Hey! Are you here? I don't see you. Uh, yeah, about that... Um... well, your mom had a minor catastrophe with the gingerbread, and we're trying to figure out... This isn't about the cookies. We're making... I'm suggesting sugar cookies! No, no. We're going to make gingerbread houses. Why can't we do sugar cookies? I think we can take care of it. Guy, guys, I'll just call a car, okay? No, no need, honey. We have sent someone else to pick you up. Yeah. Who? It's a Christmas surprise. Yeah. It's a Christmas surprise. Okay. Okay. Bye. Okay. Perfect Peterson. - Drew. - Hey. Looks like someone could use a detangler in their stocking. Maybe a dry cleaning coupon, too? You know, because you have... You know what, never mind. Let me get your bag. Oh, thanks. Nice flight? Uh, yeah. Really off to a great start. Leather seats. Oh, yeah. They're heated, too. Feel that? Toasty. What happened to your old truck, anyway? It is in my parents' garage. This girl I dated, Heather, thought an SUV might be better for work. Drew, you love that truck. I do. I do. But it's not super professional, so. So, you excited to see your folks? Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's been a while. Oh, yeah. They felt bad they couldn't pick you up, but they were pretty frazzled, so I offered. Guess frazzled runs in the family. Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Just rethinking your nickname. So, how are things at work? Oh, my gosh, work! Oh, I missed a call. Shoot. Emma, it's Bob Heaton. The clients weren't happy with what they saw, so you've got until noon to get me this model. Great. What? Well, that was my boss calling to say that I could redo a project I was working on, and I missed it, and now I'm here! Well, it's almost Christmas... maybe it's a sign to just enjoy the holidays? You wouldn't understand. Do you smell pizza? I'm always smelling pizza. I'm so sorry, Mom. Something happened to my alarm clock. Well, who still uses a regular alarm clock? You've never missed the family Christmas Eve party. Yeah. Ever. I know, I know. I just... Look, at least I'm gonna make it home on time for Christmas dinner, right? I got my flight rebooked for first thing in the morning. Honey, don't stress, okay? Yeah, all that matters is that I'm gonna see my daughter over the holidays. I come bearing a savory Yule log. Guess who's here. Hi, Drew. Hi, Emma. You on your way? She's missing the party. What? What are we going to do without our elf? Yeah, ha-hah. Very funny. You know what, why don't you and your parents come over for Christmas dinner tomorrow? Oh, you're just trying to save me from my mom's dry turkey, aren't you? Well, that too. Yeah, I'll call her right now. We'll see you tomorrow, Peanut. Okay, bye. I love you. Love you, too! Hi there. Max? Hey! Didn't expect to see you here. Me either. I thought you were going home. Yeah... I missed my flight. I mean, I'm usually very good about preparing for all eventualities, but I should have double-set my alarms. Rookie mistake. Yeah. Christmas mocha? Sure. What's in it? Oh, it's just a regular mocha with a festive name. Oh. Nice. So, I'm surprised to see you working. It's Christmas Eve. I know I'm going to sound like a Christmas curmudgeon, but there's something peaceful about being in the office and looking down at the street below, where everyone is fighting their way through the holiday rush. Christmas wouldn't be Christmas if it wasn't for last-minute shoppers. So... why are you here? Oh, getting another shot at my model. I have until noon. Maybe don't take it into the washroom this time? Oh... well, thank you! That's a good tip. Hey, Emma? I'm guessing you probably don't have plans tonight, so... the offer is still open if you'd like to join me at my party. I would love to. Great. Okay. - There you are! - Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you're home. It's so nice to see you! Oh, you look beautiful. Come on, let me take your coat. Yeah, why don't you take your hat off? - Oh... - Uh-oh. Looks like we have a hair crisis. Mm-hmm, yeah. A little girl made me into her personal gingerbread house. And that's not all. Why didn't you say anything? And ruin your chipper mood? We'll get you cleaned up and back in Christmas spirit in no time. What? No, no, no. No, no. No, no. It's taken me years to get this hairstyle. I've got a guy in Chicago... He's very hard to... It's fine. Thank you for picking her up, Drew. Oh, my pleasure. Rough trip? Oh, don't look at me. I found her that way. Hey, I got a job for you. Come on. - Oh, another one. - Of course. - Ow, ow, ow! - It's not coming out. Okay, well, maybe use some oil or something? That's not going to do it. Ow. How are things going with Drew? Fine... Can you expand on that? No... Mom, he used to tease me all through school. He called me "Perfect Peterson", which is probably going to change after this. Ow! You know what teasing means, right? Yeah, well, we're not at the school yard, Mom. Tell that to your hair. Look, I'm gonna have to cut it out. What? No, no, no, no, no. Just close your eyes... and breathe. Are you talking to me or you? There! I got it! Mom! Is it bad? Is it obvious? It might need to be evened out a little bit. What? Max! Hi! Hey. I hope you're okay with me coming to your office. There's no receptionist today. Yeah, of course. Come on in. Getting things done. Nice. Yup, almost finished. You okay? Yeah, yeah, just a bit of a Christmas crisis. Oh, no, here, sit. Thanks. The caterer for my party canceled. Oh, that's not good. They double booked, thinking they could handle both jobs. Guess I got the short end of the peppermint stick. How many people are coming? About a dozen. Uh-oh. What are you going to do? Order a pizza? Throw a couple red and green peppers on there? Maybe edible tinsel? Is that a thing? I could make it a thing. No. I'm sorry. Pizza is unacceptable for Christmas. No, you need party poppers, you need a Yule log, dip, piggies in a blanket for sure. Whoa, whoa... Sorry. I think I got a little carried away. I'm imagining the menu I'm missing at my parents' Christmas Eve party. That's a bummer. Yeah. Well, maybe you could help me out? Channel that frustration. I... I mean, I could... you know, I know it wouldn't appear that way, but I'm usually pretty good under a crisis. Well, knowing that, do you maybe want to help me shop for the party? We could hit up the Christmas Market? Did you say Christmas Market? Hey. Well, that is a look. Mm-hmm. Yup. Go ahead. With what? Make fun of my hair. I think it's cute. Very festive. Okay, this is the only clip that we had, all right? My cousin left it here. Maybe you should 'a just left that candy cane in there, then. You know, I'm not teasing you. I didn't say anything about how you finally trimmed that scraggly beard of yours. Should I not have trimmed that scraggly beard? Well, you only grew it because your ex-girlfriend, Joanna, loved guys with beards. No, I did not do that for her. It gave you that terrible rash. I didn't change myself for her. You know what, it's called trying something new. Because I'm very open-minded. And sometimes, it works, sometimes, it doesn't. Example, please, of when it works? I wouldn't be manager at the ski lodge if I didn't join the ski team. Okay, well, I convinced you to join the ski team, so... Yeah, you did. Hey, Drew, do you think the lodge can spare some salt for our driveway? Sure. Emma can go with you to help. Mom, you need me to help you in the kitchen. Nope. Actually, we don't. We've got every last detail covered right down to the party poppers. But my coat is... Your old one's in the front closet. Oh, and your grandma got you a new Christmas sweater. It's on the bed. You should wear it. Aw. Maybe it'll match your bow. This one's for you, Grandma. Everything smells so good! Good thing I have a very specific list, so we stay on task. Yes. I love a list. You know, it's funny how things work out. I mean, we only just met, and now we're planning this party together, even though it's sort of our first... outing... Outing? No, I consider this a date. I always wanted to ask you out, I just never had the nerve. What? Really? Because I thought the same thing... "Why doesn't he ask me out?" "Should I ask him out?" - Look at us now. - Yeah. I love that song. You know, the original lyrics didn't actually refer to a decorated tree... instead, to the fir's evergreen quality as a symbol of constancy. It wasn't until the 20th century that Christmas was added. Huh. You seem like quite the Christmas-tree aficionado. Not really. I put up a small, artificial one each year, but I'm more of a history buff. I mean, for me, it just wouldn't feel like Christmas without a real tree. All those needles to clean up, ornaments to take down, dragging the thing out on the sidewalk when you're done with it. All right, all right. I hear you. I hear you on the needles, but you should really try getting a real tree sometime. I mean, the smell alone... It's scientifically proven to create calm around the holidays. Oh, mine smells calm, all right. Mine smells like lavender. That's weird. Okay, I have to admit, the smell of a real tree takes me back to when I was a kid. Oh... sorry, it's home. Yeah. Okay, so we need to get party poppers, dinner rolls, crackers, Christmas cookies... Mm! Oh, and the vendor over here has charcuterie with six different cheeses. Ah. I see, I see. Organized by refrigeration. Yeah, I do the same thing when I go to the Farmer's Market on Sundays. I appreciate that. My friends always tease me for being overly organized. I don't know why. But, yeah, I got to check out that Farmer's Market sometime. Maybe we could go together. I could cook you dinner. I love to cook. I would love that. Oh, look... Spanish chorizo. My favorite. Want some? Got it at a gas station. Pass. How many of those do you eat? As many as I want. That's why I got the family pack. I like this look on you. What's that supposed to mean? Well, you know, the fancy clothes, the designer bag. I like puffy-jacket Emma, who dresses like an elf, and, I don't know, eats whipped cream out of the can. Well, people change, Drew... -Ah! Who put this here? Was it you? Huh? All right, I'll let it slide just this once. Hey, don't blame Santa. You probably put it there. This looks incredible. I mean, look at the garlands. Emma! Is that you? Gordon, Merry Christmas! Wow, you must be so happy to be home. This place looks beautiful! Cool bow. Is that your city look? What? No. No, no, no, I really like it. You know, I think this could be your whole new signature... You know, for every season, a new bow. You could have an Easter bow. A Harvest bow... Ooh, oh! A Valentine's bow. Yeah, I think we're really onto something here. Oh, yeah, I agree. I'm gonna let you two brainstorm while I grab some salt. I'm gonna go take out this bow! So what made you get into Environmental Law? My parents had me volunteering everywhere when I was a kid. From soup kitchens to cleaning up beaches. I guess it kind of stuck. That's so great that they did that. Yeah, well, they knew I'd need it for my college applications. Oh. I actually wanted to be a vet, but my dad's a lawyer, so I just ended up following in his footsteps. Hence the Short-eared Owl. And the California Condor. You know, I love the law, so it's the best of both worlds. We've done a lot of good work, cleaning up toxic sites in Alaska, protecting endangered animals. Wow. Good for you. Oh, look, your speciality. Yup. I'm all about a strong foundation. You know, my mom could never figure out why my walls didn't fall down like all the other kids'. Already a budding architect. Yeah. My dad's a contractor, so he taught me. We used to make these elaborate, multi-storey gingerbread houses, with lattice and lights! And then, as I got older, the gingerbread sort of turned into... 2x4s and bricks. When I'd come home for college, my dad would let me work on his houses, and I'd tweak the blueprints, I'd even paint, and hammer... I loved it. We have this saying... "From blueprints to boots on the ground." Sounds like he was a big influence on you. I think it was a pretty big deal when I got into architecture school. You know, my dad didn't go to college, so it was... it was sort of his dream, too. Does he put a lot of pressure on you? I don't know... I just don't want to disappoint him. We should get one for the party. Oh, I don't know, it's just gonna get stale. I'm not gonna be here on Christmas anyways. Come on. It's not a party without one. Okay, you've convinced me. I think we have everything we need. Great. Can I call you a car home? Um... I am actually gonna grab one more gift for my family, but... I'll see you at your place in an hour to decorate? What would I do without you? I can't believe you're saying that to me after 24 hours. Guess we're making up for lost time. Yeah, we already bought a house together. Okay, well, I'll... I'll see you later. - Okay. - Okay. I look like I did in high school. Hmm. Since when did looking younger become a bad thing? Um... I got you this. Oh! Thank you! Where did this come from? The gift shop. There's a lot of stuff in the closet, if you know where to look. Now you look like Emma. Thanks, Drew. You know, I heard about your accessible work program. It sounds like you're doing a pretty good thing here. Oh, please, happy to do it. You know I got the idea when I was volunteering for their ski team. - Oh, really? - Yeah. See, that's funny, 'cause I wonder who suggested that you would do that. Yeah, I can't remember who it was. It sounds like you've really found your calling. Well, nothing better than seeing people have a good time. Drew, I thought you were off? I am. I just can't stay away from this place. So, how are things? Good! The breakfast and lunch crowds were very happy. And I just finished a fun introductory frittata class with some guests. Cool. Um, this is Sarah, by the way. She is a new chef, and she lives near our folks. Oh, really? Wow. Nice to meet you. - I'm Emma. - You, too. Well, I'm going to head home. I worked on the menu with Pierre, he'll be taking over. Oh, yeah. Looks delicious. And we have a chickpea curry as a vegan option, which is my personal favorite. So, what are you doing for Christmas Eve? Nothing, actually. It'll be nice to just relax for a change and not cook. Hey, since you live so close by, my parents are having a party, if you'd like to pop in. That's really nice. Thank you. Oh, and hot-cocoa hour is about to start. We have all the toppings you like, Drew. Come back for some. Oh, we will. See ya. Wow. Nice office! Nice sweater. Excuse me. I am taking one for the team. Okay, my grandma deserves some respect... even though she buys me slightly questionable sweaters. Hey! Do you still play? Yeah... I mean, not as often as I'd like. You know, I remember you picked this up in senior year because Chantelle on the soccer team really loved musicians. I don't think we lasted a month. But I was hooked on playing after that, so. Sadly, girls are more into cars than guitars these days. Ah, yes, hence the SUV? What are you doing? I like to ditch the bulky sweaters while I'm at work, you know, so people take me more seriously. Oh, I don't know anyone who would take you seriously right now. Mind giving me a hand, then? I think it's stuck on something. Wait, don't pull it. Don't pull it, don't pull it, don't pull it. Okay. All right. It's on your button. Hang on. It's like I'm in a cocoon. Okay. Go. Go, go, go, go, go. There we go. Phew! I was starting to sweat. Yeah, it's... hot in here. Well, thank you for that. Mm-hmm. Um, I'm going to get my tie. Oh, a tie? Let me guess. Someone suggested that you wear it? Yeah. Sarah might've mentioned it. Oh... Sarah. Are you two dating, or? Oh, no. We're just friends. But she is right. I mean, having a tie makes me seem more professional. You didn't become the manager of a ski lodge because of a tie. You got the job because you're good at it. Ha! Got it. That's not a tie, it's a clip-on. A tie is a tie. Okay. Let's see it. Um... Okay, um... Can I? May I? Just, please? Oh, sure. Please. Under. Very important. Buttons... Yeah. There. You look... You look much more presentable. Yeah? You think I clean up okay? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think... Yeah. Some girls might like that. Well, hey, it's not easy dating around here. Small towns are kind of like... finding love in a snow globe. Probably a lot more options in Chicago, I bet. Yeah, I mean, you would think so, but I have swiped left so many times, I'm gonna be in Indiana pretty soon. I mean, there's this one lawyer who works in my building, we just keep passing each other in the hallway without really saying hello, so... Not easy in a big city either. Well... shall we? Sure. Holly, hi! What happened to you? I took off your sunhat while I was surfing so I wouldn't get pummeled, and instead, I got burnt. Ow. I'm sorry. Wait, are you in your apartment? Yeah, I slept in and missed my flight. You? How? Well, at least you look cute on Christmas Eve. Wait, why do you look so cute? I'm going to Max's party. What? Mr. Fancy Lawyer? Yup! I saw him in the office today. We were practically the only ones there. And we went to the Christmas Market. I helped him buy everything. It was amazing. I love this for you. You know, it sort of feels like missing my flight was meant to be. Oh! And... I'm wearing heels! Heels? No, no, no, no. Don't do that. That's dangerous. You grew up in ski boots. Okay, but, seriously, I have to go. I will call you later. Wear your hat! Good luck. Aloha! Bye. Welcome. Wow, great place. Thanks. Uh, I brought you a Yule log. It's sweet... like it's supposed to be. Nice. Let me take your coat. Wow. You look beautiful. Thank you. You look great, too. Thank you. Come on in. This is cool. It's a D-28 Harrington. Wow. You know, I have a friend back home who would die for this. How long have you played? I've always wanted to, but honestly, my decorator thought it would look cool. Oh. Oh, yeah. Totally. Yeah. Hey, we should unwrap this. Yes. Not bad. So, are you gonna go home for Christmas and see your family? I mean, I haven't even asked where you're from? Milwaukee. And, no. Actually, my mom passed away when I was in law school, so the holidays have been a little different since then. I'm so sorry. Thanks. For a while, I still went home for Christmas to see my Dad, but this one year, I had this crazy work thing I couldn't get out of, so he booked a tropical vacation with his old college buddies... He had a great time, so he kept doing it. That must've been really hard, though, not seeing your dad for the holidays? Yes and no. I started this party, and... I usually go skiing for a few days with some friends. We rent out a couple of cabins in Quebec. It's like a tradition now. I'm sure it's hard for you, not being home. Yeah. It's my first time away. Who knows, maybe it's time for a new tradition. It's too early for guests. One second. Excuse me. Yeah, I definitely didn't order this. Uh... Kris? But it says right here "Emma Peterson, Clark Street, apartment 7B." Yeah, but I... I didn't order that one. Oh, no. Did I mix them up? Consider it a free upgrade. I told you I didn't want a real Christmas tree. I know, but you have to have a real Christmas tree on Christmas. The messy needles? The sidewalk? Whaddya want me to do here? All right. Bring it in. I think I might have some of my family's old Christmas tree decorations. All right! Hey! Merry Christmas, Mrs. Roberts! Emma! I was hoping I'd see you out there on the slopes. I will be. First thing in the morning. Well, what can we get you? Emma will have a hot cocoa with extra whipped cream, marshmallows, sprinkles, and a candy cane. I'll have the same. Actually, I'm good with plain. Plain? What? Yeah. What about "the colossal cocoa", our favorite? Yeah, when we were 15. Seriously, I've cut back on my sugar intake since then. You mean you've cut back on your happiness intake? Oh, come on... I'm sweet enough. I can't argue with that. Oh! I don't know if Drew told you yet, but... I'm going to renovate the lodge. I've heard. Congratulations! George and I, you know, we used to talk about what we could do, and then when he passed... it all had to be put on hold. But since then, business has doubled. You know what they say... things happen when they're meant to... Exactly. I want to accommodate more guests... and, yeah, we've been having trouble with electrical. So what do you think? Interested? Um... I... I mean, I'm flattered, but you haven't even seen my work. Actually, your Dad shows us photos of all your projects, so. - He does? - Mm-hmm. Yes! Oh, he's so proud of you. You know, he put his hat in the ring to be the contractor? My husband, George, he just loved people who valued family, and I want to work with someone that I know and trust. I mean, that is so nice, but I'm really not sure I'm the right person for the job. I'm trying to focus more on original concepts. You could certainly put your stamp on this place. Listen, you think on it. We can talk more at the party. Okay. Thank you. You're missing out. Oh, yeah. Looks like your mouth is, too. See you tonight. Digging it. Yeah. Well, the place looks amazing. Thank you so much for your help. It was fun. You're not mad about the tree, are you? No. Not at all. I was gonna call you for clean-up duty. Oh. Okay. Wait. - The mistletoe! - The mistletoe. Where do you want to hang it? Uh... Oh, okay. How about... you wait there. Right here? Perfect. Got it. - Whoo! - Whoa. You okay? Yeah... That better not be another tree. Where's Drew? Oh, he's salting the driveway. Oh, he is such a great kid. Isn't he, though? It's amazing what a novelty that is these days. Mm-hmm! You know, the lodge is sure lucky to have him. Uh-huh. Oh, speaking of the lodge, I saw Mrs. Roberts this afternoon... Oh, she's coming to the party! And did she mention that I put my name in to be the contractor on the renovation? She did. She actually asked if I was interested in being the architect. What did you tell her? The truth... that I'm busy. Oh! Did you get the Miami project? They haven't made any decisions yet. Oh. Well, I'm sure you're gonna get it. I know how much work you put in on it. Oh! Our first guests are here! Merry Christmas! Mom's here! Oh, let me take your coat. That looks delicious! We just put out the food. Come on. Hi. Sarah, hi! Thank you so much for inviting me. Yeah, I did do that, didn't I? Wow! It's so beautiful! This is gonna be fun. Yeah. Merry Christmas, my man! Wow. You have outdone yourself. Yeah. Your apartment looks so festive. Didn't expect this from you, Max. Thank you. I owe it all... to Emma. Are you two...? No. No, no, no. We just met yesterday. - Hi. I'm Sharice. - Hi. And I'm Will. Nice to meet you both. Pleasure, Why don't we get the two ladies some champagne? Thank you. That's a beautiful dress. Oh, thank you. I've been waiting three months for an excuse to wear it. A designer friend in Paris made it. Wow. It's nice to have friends who make gorgeous things. The best. So, how did you two meet? We work at the same office building. Ah... makes sense. Will's a lawyer at the firm and Sharice is a circuit court judge. You are a judge? That's incredible. Youngest on the bench. Why do you always have to tell people that? Because I'm proud of you. And I like to take credit for your accomplishments. Uh-huh. There we go. - Help yourself. - Oh, thank you. So, a judge, wow. What is your secret? How have you managed to climb that ladder so quickly? This is gonna sound corny, but I started with a vision board when I was young, and I kept adding to it over the years. I kept my eye on what I really wanted. I've got one of those, too. It's a great motivator. Great minds think alike. Yeah, it got me through some hard years in college. You know, I think it's important to know that we all struggle. Absolutely. Yeah, I don't think we women share things enough. Everything always has to seem perfect. You are so right. So, did you... did you always know what you wanted to do? Actually, no. No. I double-majored in neuroscience and French. Whoa! Ambition is both a blessing and a curse. I mean, I hardly ever see my family, and who knows when I'll have time for kids... But I'm achieving my goals, and that's what's important to me right now. That is what's most important... Achieving your goals. What do you do, Emma? Emma's an architect. I'm a junior architect. Anything I would've seen? Mostly just interiors, but if you saw my vision board, you would know that I dream of opening my own firm one day. Good for you. I'll hold you to it. See you in a bit. Well, they're a little overdone, again, but some icing, a few gumdrops, no one will know the difference. Are you even listening? Yeah. Gumdrops. Got it. Well, the kids can start decorating... And you know what that means... Are you ready to get dressed? You know, I'm so happy to help with the gingerbread houses, but I think I'm gonna skip the outfit this year. But you love this costume. No, Mom. You love this costume. I have maybe outgrown it. But the kids? Okay... let's compromise. All right, here we go. Good? Okay... you do still look really cute, but for the record, I'm gonna miss my little elf. Okay! Who's ready to make gingerbread houses? I always forget how much I love the look of gingerbread houses. So cozy. I love the snow icing. Reminds me of where I grew up. We spent so many Christmases at the ski hill. You should come with us. Where? I mean, this might be a bit too soon, you know, but we're going on that ski trip tomorrow... The one I was talking about. Right. That is very sweet of you, but my flight home leaves at 10 a.m., so... Max, Emma! It's time for Christmas charades! Everyone! Gather round. I've waited all year for this re-match! I've just got to grab this. I will be right back. Drew! How's it going over there? Well, I could really use an architect with pointy ears right about now. Ooh! Yeah. I offered my assistance, but, apparently, they want "the real architect". I'm sorry. Hey, how are my mom and dad? They're good. They miss you, though. We miss you! We miss you, hon'. Hey, say hi to Emma, everybody! We miss you! You know, I'm waiting for your Aunt Martha to arrive. That'll be my cue to exit. Ah. That is a perk of not being there. Yeah, so you really don't miss us at all? I didn't say that. You know, I guess I didn't realize how much I... Merry Christmas! Sorry we stole Emma from you this year. Well, here I was, worried that you were crying in your colossal cocoa, but you... you look to be okay. I better go, but give everyone a hug for me, and... thanks for calling. 'Kay. Coming! Oh, what beautiful houses! Oh, here you go. - Oh, thank you! - Welcome! Merry Christmas! Long time no see. - Hey, you. - Hey. We're just teaching the kids about building strong foundations... While keeping it fun. Mm-hmm. Hoping Emma sees how fun it would be for all of us to, you know, work together. Yeah. It would be amazing to get your expertise on the renovation. Okay, I see what's going on... It's a tag team. Listen, I appreciate the opportunity, I really do, but... -I've got a job in Chicago... and a life there... The logistics... It would just be so complicated. What if I hired your firm? I mean, I'm sure they take on outside cases. I mean, they do... but... Um... Christmas lights are out at the lodge again, and Gordon's off for Christmas Eve, so I'm gonna go fix that. I'll go. No! You just got here. - Stay and mingle. - Yeah. Come on in. Have some food. Okay. Aunt Martha just called. She's not feeling up to the party. Would you mind bringing her some of my Christmas pudding? Right now? She really loves my Christmas pudding. Unless someone else wants to volunteer... Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, Mom, it's just... I'm so busy with the gingerbread houses. They look finished. Um... you know what, I can... I can swing by on my way back from the lodge. No. No. It's okay. You don't have to do that. I will go with you. Strength in numbers. Now, that's the Christmas spirit! Why are you so good to my family? Well, because they're so good to me. Do you miss living next door? Yeah! I miss how close we all were. Yeah, we didn't even have to knock. Yeah. Although I live, like, five minutes away, so... it's really cool. I wish you were a little bit closer, though. Yeah, well, you still got Sarah, right? Sarah? Uh, yeah. I guess. I mean, yeah, she's really nice. Oh, I took one of her cooking classes at the lodge, and I learned how to make vegan pesto and creamy polenta, and, actually... it wasn't that bad. You hate cooking, and your favorite food is beef jerky. That's true, but, um, you know, she doesn't really know many people here, so... Okay. You were just trying to be welcoming. You're a good guy. Yeah. Just being a friend. I think she might think you're more than friends, but... Well, she's not really my type. I... I much prefer... the smart... completely stubborn type... with... you know, pointy ears. Well, I would say maybe confident rather than stubborn. You know what they say... believe in your "elf". You're throwing out elf jokes? I'll be here all night. I hope so. I'm-I'm-I'm blocked in. My SUV. Oh! Oh. Well, why don't we just take your truck? It's in your parents' garage, right? See, what did I say? Smart. There she is... the one and only. Yeah. My Dad and I spent four years on the restoration. I remember. Didn't realize how much I missed her. Now, can you please take off that tie? You cannot drive a truck like this in a tie. Yes, ma'am. All right, let's see it. All right... focus. A wilted Christmas tree? Jumping? A Christmas contortionist! Ten seconds. - Candy cane! - Yes! Okay, okay. Um... Reindeer! A donkey! Rudolph! Baby reindeer! Uh... A... Santa Claus! Um, uh... okay, okay. Guys, come on. I'm on a shelf. No talking! Snow globe? An elf! I'm an elf! Our team wins! All right... I suck. I can't believe we lost. I'm usually so good at charades. You know, statistically, you only win charades about 50% of the time. So many variables with the subject matter. At least we're not in charge of saving Ivory-Billed Woodpeckers. At least. I'm going to go get the hot cocoa. - I'll be back. - Okay. - Hello? - Emma. It's Bob Heaton. Listen, sorry to bother you on Christmas Eve, but I have good news. Um, okay. About what? The Florida clients loved your clubhouse model. They're going to send over the paperwork after the holiday. Okay! When do I go to Miami? Oh... sorry, no, we're not actually sending you to Florida. We need you in the office working on it. Oh... but I thought... It's just more efficient... and then you can start working on the next project. You're getting so good at these models, Emma. Keep it up. Everything okay? Yeah... I guess I just thought I'd be more involved. It sounds like I'm gonna be stuck in the office, rather than on the ground. Hopefully, it's a quiet office. You know how I love a quiet office. Oh, me too. I guess I just thought I'd be there, you know, to bring the project to life. Here. Something to make you feel better. I figured you were a plain hot chocolate kind of person. Who needs all those bells and whistles when the cocoa is sourced ethically? Yeah, totally. I'm going to get the cake. - Oh. - Do you want help? No. I'm okay. Thanks. Who wants cake? Is that a Yule log? Oh! Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, I am so, so sorry! You know what. That's not going to help. I just... I feel terrible. It's okay. Really. I... never wear the same dress twice. I should just... go. No, Emma. Come on. It's just... it's just an accident. Totally. It's just a dress. But I think I'll go freshen up. Yeah. I'll grab some more paper towel, - help clean up. - Excuse me. I wanted you to have the perfect party and I completely ruined it. You didn't ruin it. Emma. I should really go. Are you sure? Yeah. It's for the best anyways. I've gotta finish packing for my flight in the morning. I'll grab your coat. Yeah, definitely no Christmas lights. There are so many memories here, huh? Oh, yeah. All those years on the ski team. The bonfires... Mm. The starry nights. There's something about this little mountain town. There's a reason why people say there's no place like home. Mm-hmm. You're happy in the city, though? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah! It's busy, it's fun... Mm-hmm. Yeah. You never thought about leaving, huh? Oh, not really. I mean, my family's here. I've got a good job, you know? Life is good. Only thing I'm missing is... -What? You know, it doesn't matter. You... you made it clear in school that you weren't interested, so. Pardon me? What are you... What are you talking about? Come on, you know I had a crush on you. Yeah, you did not. - Come on! - I did! Yes, I did. Why didn't you say anything? Well, for a long time, I was... I was afraid of, you know, ruining our friendship... and then... then you hurt your knee... and then you went to prom with Basketball Bobby. Well, his name is Brian, but... I mean, I only went with him because he asked. I barely knew the guy. I... I didn't know that. Yeah, I guess we didn't really talk about our feelings much then, did we? No, not really. Anyway, and then you... went to college, and I didn't want to hold you back. You know, I knew you were going to be somebody, and, um... I... I didn't know if you felt the same way. We should probably... get to the lights. I'm sure your guests are getting restless. Yeah. Is it working? No. Try jiggling the cord. The... Now? Yeah! Yeah! Come look! What? It worked? Oh, yeah! This place is so great. You know, I mean, it really doesn't even need that much work. Hypothetically, you know, what kinds of things are you thinking? Okay... - well, if.. - If, yeah. If I did the renovation, I would open up the foyer to create a proper front-desk area, definitely add some skylights to allow that beautiful southern light to flow in, and... it's seriously lacking some sort of outdoor hot tub area... Oh! Oh! Like a stage for live music! Did you just come up with that off the top of your head? Yeah! See, this is what I'm talking about! Think of what you could do if you took the job. You know, I mean, like, that is if you... like, if you wanted to be here. Wow! You really lit up the place! Gordon. Hey. You're here. Yeah. Thanks for coming in. Okay! Yeah! You two... You two, have fun. I don't wanna... I don't wanna spoil your... Your evening. I'm just gonna go... make snow angels. - Aunt Martha. - Aunt Martha. Maybe she's not home. We can just leave this and go. - Yeah, I think so. - Okay. Aunt Martha! You look amazing! Carolers! At last! Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. It's me. It's your great niece, Emma. Sing, Child! I... no. 'Cause we're just here for... I'm 85 years old. How long do you plan on keeping me waiting? What do you wanna sing? Uh, I don't want... I don't want to sing. - "Jingle Bells"? - Drew, Drew... "Silent Night"? Sing! Uh... I'm sorry. What do you want to sing? Nothing! You know I'm a terrible singer. Why won't she just take the pudding? I am freezing my tootsies off! What kind of carolers are you? I've waited less time at the DMV! Oh, I'll be right back! I'm gonna grab something. Drew! Oh! Here he... Oh! Oh! Look! Is that's the best you can do? Some carolers! Merry Christmas! I was horrible, you were great... As usual. I was inspired by somebody. You know, Aunt Martha. Thank you. So I had a really good time today. Yeah, I did, too, until a cake literally fell into your friend's lap. It was kind of funny. But I will deny that under oath. Think about tomorrow. We meet at the airport in the morning. I'll text you the details. Okay? Okay. I mean, it kind of would be a waste, wouldn't it? Remember that time when you had to drive the Zamboni after hockey practice? Oh, my gosh. I had no idea how to operate that thing. I mean, you can drive a truck. How did it go with Aunt Martha? Um, better than expected. Uh... don't make me do that again, Mom. Even though she doesn't say it, I know she appreciates it. But does she? Drew... it sounds like Deena and John might be in for the next cooking class. Oh, that's great. Though you still seem to be the only one who wants vegan. Ah... well, you know what I always say... Tofurkey is underrated. You never say that. I'm gonna grab another drink. Do you want a hot cider? Um, sure. Thank you. Yeah. Tofurkey, huh? Wow. I'm just making conversation. Oh, and you don't like cider. I thought you guys were just friends? We are. Well, then why try to change yourself? I'm not trying to change myself. I'm trying... It's called trying something new. Sarah wants to do a cooking school at the lodge, and I'm trying to support her, because, apparently, vegan's a tough sell around here, so just doing some test classes. What about Joanna? Remember? She really liked mountain men, so you grew this big, scraggly beard? So what? I manscaped. Uh-huh. And then there was Heather. She really wanted you to get an SUV. Yeah, but I... Well, that's because I like the heated seats and the sport mode. Then there was the guitar, the tie... And what, now you're vegan? Okay, okay... The way I see it, relationships are about give and take, right? They're about trying something new that maybe you wouldn't have tried otherwise. Really? Because I think you're just trying to get somebody's attention. Yeah, maybe I am. I... you know what, I joined the ski club because I liked you. It was still the best decision I ever made, because I got to know the Roberts family, and I found my purpose in the lodge, and I'm still mostly me. Whereas, you, Emma, you have changed so much. It's like you're trying to be this... this fancy version of yourself that likes plain cocoa. I know you don't like plan cocoa! I know you like colossal cocoa. So... so what are you trying to prove? Who are you doing that for? Because I know it's not for you. I don't get it. I thought we had a moment earlier. I'm sorry, I'm tired of waiting for you to see me. Wait! Drew, come on... Hey. Party's winding down. I think I'm just going to hang out up here. I'll make less of a mess that way. Everything's falling apart, Dad. Oh, come on, the gingerbread houses look great. Dad, Drew was right. I feel like I'm just... I'm placing these crazy expectations on everything and everyone. It's like if nothing fits into my perfect blueprint, if anything goes outside the line, then... nothing works out. In a lot of ways, life is a blueprint... You've got to have plans, know where you're going... but one thing I've learned being a contractor... You've got to be ready for anything that comes your way. Life is a series of adjustments. What matters most... is building the best house you can with what you've got. But I just wanted to come home and tell you that I did it. You know, that... that I was a success. That I could do it on my own. But... I didn't get the Miami project, Dad. I messed up the model. I completely blew it. I let you down. I'm so sorry. What are you talking about? You could never let me down, peanut. I always knew you would be a great architect because you're smarter than your old man... and you've got the talent. But don't do it for me. The most important thing is that you're happy. Do you remember when you lost that downhill championship when you were 14? Yeah. That's the day I blew out my knee. I was not happy. No. But do you remember what you did after? Yeah, I did those knee exercises. Every. Day. For a whole year. And Drew was the one pushing you. Yeah, he was. And then you came back and won that championship the very next year. That was a good day. - That was a good day. - It was a good day. But, you know... the best part wasn't seeing you up on that podium... it was watching you race. After all that hard work you put in, you were out there just doing it for you. And those are the moments that make being a parent so special. Maybe it's time for you to start following your heart. With everything. And do it for you. 'Cause you deserve it. Thanks, Dad. Hi, Santa. Shouldn't you be out there delivering presents? The night is still young. Yeah. Did you find what you were looking for? I don't know yet. It might be right in front of you. Thanks. Well... you better get to work. Merry Christmas! We missed you. Mrs. Roberts really wants you to do the renovation. Drew... Aunt Martha... my Dad... It was all just a dream. Taxi! Hi. Hi! You again. Hey, have you ever had a dream that felt so real, it was like it actually happened? Yeah. I had a dream last night that my first passenger gave me a giant tip 'cause it's Christmas. Okay. Here you go. What? Thanks for the tip! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Emma. You came! Max... I'm so glad you made it. Um... I'm not actually going on the ski trip. I'm going home. I'm sorry. But thank you so much for the generous offer. Of course. Of course. We should go out in the new year, though. Max, I don't think I'm the girl for you. If I'm being totally honest with myself about where my life is headed and what I actually want... it turns out I prefer dysfunctional family gatherings to perfect holiday parties. I get it. Well, I hope you have a wonderful time with your family. I'm actually kind of envious. Thank you. Have a great time with your friends, and... Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Emma. I made it! Please tell me I'm not too late. 10 minutes to spare. Oh! Okay. Thank you. Merry Christmas, Mrs. Roberts. It's Emma Peterson. Hi. I'm just heading home, but I was wondering if you had a second to chat. Merry Christmas, Dad! Hey! Oh, peanut! I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you! I'm so happy to be home. How's Mom? Oh, you know your mother. She's busy cooking up a storm. Come on, let's go! I can't believe, after all of that, your flight ended up being delayed. So I got some news. Huh? Shirley Roberts officially offered me the Ski Lodge renovation this morning. Funny you mention that, because she offered me the contractor position. Yeah, I know. Because I wanted to work with you. You're the best contractor I know. Wait... you took it? What about the Miami project? My firm actually chose my golf clubhouse model. That's amazing! And then I resigned. What? Why would you do that? Because, Dad, I want to work where I'm valued. You know... making a difference... Creating something from scratch and seeing it through. Then I found out I was going to be stuck in the office making models while the senior architects got all the opportunities on the ground. I get it. From Blueprints... to Boots on the Ground, as we used to say. Yup! Hey, you remember when we also used to talk about running our own business together? All your contracting... and architectural needs. So... how do you feel about teaming up? On the Ski Lodge? Absolutely. No. I mean permanently. What? Are you serious? Well... I can think of nothing more satisfying than you bringing me coffee every morning in our new office. Actually, I think it would be the other way around. Well, I don't know. Peanut, I love this idea. Yeah. Well... sometimes, things happen the way they're supposed to. Hey, does Drew know about this plan of yours yet? He doesn't even know I'm home. I think you should tell him... And probably in person. I know where he is. Really? Yeah, they're apparently having electrical issues down at the lodge. I could drop you off there? Um, yeah. Okay. If you don't mind? Oh, no. Not at all. You know, I always thought you and Drew would make a good match. Nothing yet. Over. Okay. Was that it? Over. Nope. Keep trying. Over. Hey! You're here! Hey, tell Mom I'll be home soon! All right. Will do. The Christmas lights are out. It's a breaker issue, we think... We hope. Yeah. We can't have that on Christmas. My thoughts exactly. I'm coordinating with Gordon. Did you try jiggling the cord? Hmm. Not super technical, but we can give it a shot. Gordon, jiggle the cord. Over. Okay. Jiggling. Over. It worked! How did you know that would work? You're my good-luck charm. Uh, what about me? Over. I'm turning this off. This feels familiar... Drew, you know how you always call me "Perfect Peterson"? Yeah. You know I'm just teasing. No. I know. But you're right. I'm a perfectionist. I plan everything... From my job, to the way a Yule log should taste, to... what I think a perfect guy should look like. You know, in the last 48 hours, I thought I met that guy. And we spent an almost perfect day together. I'm so happy for you. No, but I realized that I want someone who pushes me outside of my comfort zone, who... who makes life... unpredictable... and... and fun. What are you saying? I have feelings for you, Drew. I've always had feelings for you. You had a crush on me? Yeah! I mean... then why didn't you say anything? I don't know... Because I went away to college, and the I had... this thing inside of me that thought I had to be a certain way, and... I don't know. I didn't... I didn't know if you felt the same way. Emma... Last night, I realized how much I miss you, and it's not just because I desperately needed your expertise with the gingerbread... or that they made me bring pudding to your Aunt Martha's alone, which I don't think I'll ever recover from. Thinking back on all those Christmases... your parents, together... I salted the driveway... I put the lights up, I got the firewood... I did all that gladly because it meant... I got to be with you. So you had a crush on me, too, huh? Isn't that obvious? Drew, no matter where I go, you always feel like home. That was weird. Yeah, weird. Wait, when you said "weird", did you mean, like, bad-weird, or... No, really good-weird. Oh! Um... I talked to Mrs. Roberts. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna take the project in Vermont, I'm gonna team up with my Dad. Yes! That is amazing! Yes! I'm so happy for me! For you. I'm happy for... I'm happy for you, Perfect Peterson. You know I'm not perfect, right? You are to me. Um, let's go get your stuff because we're going to be late for Christmas dinner. Oh, yeah. That's right. -Oh! Ow! Who put that there? I swear that it came out of nowhere. But it was funny! Just a little bit. Ow!
