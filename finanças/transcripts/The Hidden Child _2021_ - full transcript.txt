THE HIDDEN CHILD As you set out for Ithaca, hope your road is a long one, full of adventure, full of discovery. As you set out for Ithaca... full of adventure, full of discoveries. Plural... not "discovery". Who is it? First floor on the right. Sign, please. Thanks, have a good day. Always keep Ithaca in your mind. To arrive there is your ultimate goal. But... do not hurry the voyage. Exactly. Do not hurry the voyage. Does anyone know who Nadia Boulanger is? She was an important musician, but she also taught many famous European and American pianists. I want to tell you an anecdote about her. One day, a friend asked her to recommend a piano teacher for his son. She stopped to think it over, then asked how old the boy was. "Seven", replied her friend. "Well then, I'm sorry, but it's too late". This may seem paradoxical, but she was right. Much like with circus acrobats, even pianists must start training, studying, and playing at a young age. All of you are undoubtedly late compared to those who were great artists of the piano. Gabriele, you should give these kids some hope. Thursday night poker at my place? - Who else is coming? - The two of us and... Nerano, the attorney. D'alterio... - The reporter? - Yes. All he talks about is murders and mafia. It's just a poker game... - What time? - 9:00. - You don't know? - I don't! Buddy, you'd better have info tomorrow. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Carmine Acerno's son, Ciro, is missing. They're searching like crazy. They're busting my balls, like I'm the watchman of the shit that happens here. - He's missing? - He ran away, prof. - Put it on my tab. - Okay. - Hello, professor. - Hello, Nunzio. - Can I smoke? - Sure. If you need me, I'll be in there. Who are you? How did you get in? You're Ciro, the kid from upstairs. They're looking for you. Help me. Hide me. Hello. How are you, professor? I was in the area so I stopped by. - Sorry, Diego, I'm working. - You don't have a minute for me? I wanted to talk. I'd forgotten how nice your apartment is. What can I do for you, Diego? Professor, I'm so grateful you taught me to appreciate music. I'm thinking about playing again, with your help, of course. What do you do now? I manage a few nightclubs... I can't complain. Could I have a glass of water? Sure. I was about to bring you the water. - I didn't want to tire you out. - Carrying a glass won't tire me out. It's nice and fresh. Can you play that piece you let me hear last time I came to visit? - Something about a dream... - Schumann. Prof, it was a real pleasure seeing you again. Sorry for barging in so late, I appreciate the hospitality. Come out. - My dad sent him. - Why? What did you do? You're burning up. You have a fever. Did you eat? I'll give you an aspirin after you eat. What do you want? What are you saying? Do you hear what he's saying? Do you hear him? It's the third time you've jerked me around. - You're nuts! - I'll ask your wife. Get out of here, leave! Who are you hiding from? - Morning, Mariano. - Morning, prof. - Any news? - About what? - That missing kid. - Nothing yet. I don't blame him for running. They're savages, they don't respect anyone. Even Amitrano's son, Rosario, they already took him away. Jesus, what a day! Why did you leave? You weren't here, I thought you went to my dad's. - Where were you hiding? - The abandoned doorman's house. There are stairs that lead to underground tunnels. Me and Rosario go there. - Who's Rosario? - My friend. Rosario Amitrano. How are you? Why do you keep peeing on my neighbor's door? He's an asshole, a kid from school. How do you know I pee on his door? Why don't you tell me what you and your friend did? You're better off trusting me. They already caught Rosario. How do you know? I know. Not dressed yet? I'm going out. 20 minutes late. Will you ever get rid of this awful habit? I'm only 10 minutes late, your watch is ahead. Never mind, Gabriele. Decide what you want to eat, I'm ready. What are you having? Sea bass and string beans. I'll have pasta with potatoes. - Wine? - You know I don't drink at lunch. I think I'll have a glass. - So... how's dad? - Dad? Last week dad was unwell, really unwell. He was hospitalized. But what do you care? You're fucking self-centered. You never bother to ask about him or even visit. Anyway, he's better now, he's back home. Filippo. Come here. Why are you wearing Ciro's shirt? Don't touch his stuff. Do it again and I'll kill you. Gabriele, let's set aside this pitiful family farce. You mentioned your friend needed something... Right. Something insane happened to him. He found a 10-11 year old boy in his house. This kid won't explain why he needed to run away from home. He suspects the mafia might be involved. - Based on what? - I don't know... Maybe he sensed something, I guess. In any case, this kid is terrified by the idea of going home. And he doesn't know what to do. What would you suggest? Well... from what you've told me, your friend is in a real tight spot. A tight spot that could ruin him. Understand? Ruin him. I always knew you were reckless, but not to this extent. There's no so-called friend in this story, it's you. And the only thing you can do is hand that boy back to his family immediately. Even if you took him to the police, what would you say? And for your information, kidnapping a minor could get you 3 to 12 years. Not to mention what the mafiosi would do to you... if they're involved, if they knew you were hiding the kid. Understand? So by law, this kid has no hope. Law? What fucking law are you talking about? You invented the law. Why did you let him stay in your house? Explain. Did you want company? I'll never understand you. For years you've made inexplicable choices and you're paying the price by living a shitty life, in a shitty neighborhood, surrounded by shitty people. You preferred that instead of your family because as you say, the family horrifies you. You gave up concerts when you were a child prodigy pianist. You sentenced yourself to failure. Next week, if things go as planned, I'll be appointed to the High Council of the Judiciary. And this time, believe me, I won't let you cause trouble for me like you did with every other important step in my life. I won't allow it. So don't call me, don't write me. Forget that I'm your brother. Hello, can I see whoever's in charge? The deputy chief is busy now, have a seat. "Mother of mafia boss mugged. She's critical" "Maria De Vivo was mugged two days ago by two boys on a moped in an alley of the Spanish Quarters." That man is here for you. This elevator's always busted. - It's okay, I'm used to it. - Let me carry it. Thanks, prof. - I'll do it. - No need. Thanks. - Are you all right? - It's just asthma. Want to come in? Yes, thanks. How odd. We live in the same building but have never spoken. Though I'm usually at home, I barely go out. I've always been a solitary person. What's wrong with being alone? Excuse me. What do you want? No, I can't talk. - Here's some water. - Thanks. I feel better. I'll go. You could've left this place, why didn't you? There's still time, why don't you leave? He's the piano teacher from the first floor. My son Mimmo. Go shower. - Goodbye, ma'am. - Bye. What are you doing? Tell me what you did or I'll take you home. Understand? Do you want to go back home? Tell me what you and your friend did. Go ask De Vivo. Who's De Vivo? This must be my student. Go hide, now! Carry on. Sir, this is for last month's lessons. Thanks. Nice payoff. Listen, if you want to stay here, mind your own business. And don't you dare touch my books again. Come out. - What's going on? - Waiting for you to wake up. - I was asleep? - Yes. - You had a nightmare? - I didn't have a nightmare. You're the one who's a scaredy-cat! If you don't like me, find someone else willing to risk his life to hide you. You think I'm afraid to leave here? I know how to kill. A few weeks ago I saw two losers die. I saw it with my own eyes. I don't believe you. No? Go find out how the Mesas died, those two shitheads who set fire to Musella's warehouse. Me and my dad brought them to a garage in Borgo Sant'Antonio. He shot them right here. In the head. First one, then the other. After he killed the first one, the second shit himself. Go find out if I'm talking shit. What's wrong with you? Shut this off, give me my phone. Now! I ain't afraid of anyone I ain't afraid of anyone I ain't afraid of anyone My memory sucks Let go! You don't like it? I've been locked inside for three days, I'm bored. Not my fault. I left food for you, I'm going out. Where? Going to fuck a gal? Where's the remote? Don't use the TV when I'm out or the neighbors will notice. This place is like a funeral home! If you had kids there'd be some toys to pass the time. Why didn't you ever get married? Nobody wanted to marry you 'cause you're grumpy? - Antonio. - How are you, Gabriele? Fine. Mezzera, hello. Hello, Santoro. Gabriele, sit here. Vittorio. A little bird told me our reporter friend was quite a hit at the club. Tell us the joke you told them. No, never mind, plus I forgot it already. - Short-term memory... - No chit-chat, let's play. I watched an episode of "Narcos" last night. I fell asleep after two minutes, what a drag. Three cards for me. I read your article about the mugging of the mafia boss' mother. - Any updates? - She's still in a coma. - How is she? - I have no idea. She's at Caldarelli hospital, go there and ask if she's alive. Two cards. I thought you knew. We know about who's alive or dead, not those in between. We leave those to you reporters. At the courthouse they're saying it was De Vivo who planned it all, he did it to take control because his mother wouldn't step down. The son says it wasn't a mugging, and the two kids are an excuse to get rid of the mother. Peppino from the conservatory said De Vivo caught one of the kids. - And the other? - Other what? Other kid. Someone is helping him hide. Someone who thinks he can screw over De Vivo. Whoever this guy is, he won't last more than a few days, he'll drown and die like a fly in a bottle. I have to go, it's late, sorry. Me too, I have to wake up at 6:00 tomorrow. I've seen you before, not sure where. You're confusing me with someone else. I'm a piano teacher at the conservatory. - A musician! - Yes. Lucky you, you don't give a shit about words. Here's the professor. Professor! What are you doing? Walking around alone this late? I live there. May I accompany you home? Bye, honey. A furtive tear Appeared in her eyes I'd really like to take piano lessons again, like I told you. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Come by tomorrow evening at 6:00 and we'll talk. Are you stressed out, prof? What's wrong? My associate noticed your trash bag wasn't closed tight and a cheese stick wrapper was popping out. He was surprised: "The professor eats cheese sticks?" I said: "What's the big deal? So he likes cheese sticks". You like little kids? Sorry, professor Santoro, I didn't mean to offend you. For real. Can I go? What are you gonna do? I can't stay here forever. They'll catch us in the end. Now's not the time to talk, go to sleep. I'll buy you clothes tomorrow. You can't keep wearing the same things. Actually, take them off, I'll get them washed. Put this on. Enough now, go to bed. What happened? Hold this. If you have something to tell me, I'm here. If the conservatory hadn't expelled me, now I'd be... a professional pianist. Making money playing in clubs. But I'm forced to live another life. You can't imagine the situations I find myself in. - What situations? - Never mind, professor. Lie down. Want some water or cognac? A sip of cognac. I saw you in the courtyard with Carmine Acerno. - Do you work with him? - No. I barely know him. His wife came to my club. Liar! He slapped you and you didn't react. The night before, I saw another man with you, who was he? You inspire trust, but we're going down a dead end. - Meaning? - You know I'm fond of you. But I can't say anything. If that's the case, then leave. That fucker thinks I'll quietly let him drag me into this. But I could tear his eyes out. Who's dragging you into it, Acerno or De Vivo? Wasn't De Vivo with you in the courtyard that night? Why did he beat you up? Because of a kid. A kid? A kid nobody can find. Thanks, prof. How are you, Gabriele? You seem distressed about something. - I've told you before, enjoy your life. - How, dad? Teach me. The only thing you live intensely is your fantasies, but life is made up of facts. You're a Protestant in the wrong place. Wonder who I took after. I'm starting to lose it, every day is worse. I don't even remember who I just saw, what they said, what I did. Your brother brought me newspapers and the next day he asked if I read the "Corriere" article. I didn't even remember he came by, let alone the article! It's normal to forget things at your age. To keep my brain active, I memorize poems. Glimmering stars of the Great Bear, I never thought I'd be back to see you shining down on my father's garden, nor talk to you again from the windows of this house where I spent my childhood and saw the last of my happiness vanish. How dare you complain? You're incredible. What imaginings, what fancies... You know, my co-workers used to tease me and call me "Encyclopedia Britannica". And if anyone wanted to refer to an old sentence, they had to turn to me. When I was a kid, you always seemed annoyed about going to work. I liked my work, but... judging was a burden. Life is full of shades of gray, and justice has to give up at one point, it can't shine light on everything. All that remains at the end of a trial is an infinite feeling of compassion for human suffering, nothing but this. Compassion? This might shock you, but today... if I had to choose between law and love, I'd choose love. What happened? He's dead. - Who? - You don't know? The kid they were looking for, Rosario Amitrano. He was playing and fell into the well. What's wrong? Why aren't you talking? Want to watch a movie on TV? What's going on? Tell me. Stop, please, this is torture. Legato, like this. I'll be honest, Luisa, at this rate you won't pass the test. Your playing is sloppy, without thought and without feeling. If you're not capable of doing what I tell you, then quit. Start again. If you want a gun, I'll tell you where to find it. Really? So tell me, where? Go to Pozzuoli's archaeological park. Once you get inside the tunnel, count 50 steps and look at the wall on the left. Stop in front of a "C" written with coal. Underneath it there's a tile you can move. My father's weapons are in that hole. Grab the Beretta. It's a "7", easier to hide and handle. But make sure to do it at night. Believe me? No. Who is it? Come up. Go hide, I have a guest for dinner, I forgot. You forgot. The first time in 10 years. We can postpone... No need, my kitchen's fully stocked, but no champagne. I brought a nice white wine. - You do it, I'm incapable. - I know. To us. I'll go cook. - Can I put on some music? - Go ahead. - Haven't heard from you lately. - I've been busy at the conservatory. Really? You could've called at least. - I called you a dozen times. - You're right. What's wrong? You seem odd. Nothing, why? I feel like a burden. You're not. You know what? I'll come by some other time. Biagio... You should've told me you're a fucking fag! If I'd known, I wouldn't have stayed here, you cocksucker. You like being ass-fucked?! Let go! Don't touch me. Wait! Ciro? Ciro? Ciro! Ciro! Can I help you? Your wife forgot this the other day. - Who is it? - You forgot the soap. See what he wants... You didn't have to come. Goodnight. Goodnight. Carmine, you're wrong. Listen to me. Hold on. - Ciro's your son! - No! - He's dead to me. - What? Don't you understand? You have to forget about Ciro or we're all dead. If we side with De Vivo, we'll all win. Us and our kids. Focus on the ones who are alive, not dead. Angela! You sicken me! You sicken me. Alfonso, how's mom? Gimme two days. I'll bring him to you. I went to get milk. Let's go have breakfast. Get dressed. Folks, closing time. ...36, 37, 38, 39, 40... 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. Even if you can't shape your life the way you want, at least try as much as you can not to degrade it by too much contact with the world, by too much talk, by too much activity. Do not degrade it by dragging it along and exposing it to the daily silliness of social relations and parties until it comes to seem a boring hanger-on. Lemme have a drink first! It's we who interrupt the action of the gods, hasty and inexperienced creatures of the moment. We. What happened? Why didn't you come home? Can you imitate Totò? Can I imitate Totò? I used to know how, let's see... Like this. No way! Totò moves more like a puppet. Move your head more, and then like this. Wanna play? - What? - We'll imitate animals. What animals can you do? Come on, let's play. I win! Are you dead? Pick a card. Memorize it, put it back in. There's no trick, no deception. I'll shuffle. Smooth... Smooth... Is this it? - How'd you do that? - I'm a magician. The fool's face, I wear it for you The crazyman's scowl, I wear it for you In the middle of my head I feel this heavy thing I stop here, I stop there And start to count from one to 300, out loud He's crazy, he's crazy People say: "Run, run!" I sold 300 carriages I sold 300 palaces I look like a madman Only for you! Oh, how heavy my head is Oh, how heavy my head is He's crazy, he's crazy Oh, how heavy my head is... Is there any shower gel? Mom always pours it in. But don't look, I'm embarrassed. Do you miss your mom? I only miss my cell phone. So? Are we screwed, Gabriele? Come here. Come on. I lied the other day. I didn't see the Mesas get killed. I knew that. Some killer... Professor, hello. - Hear about Acerno? - No. Dead on the rooftop. They say he shot himself. - What happened? - Get up, we have to go. - Why? - Hurry up! - Tell him no run-around this time. - Sure thing. Good. Stay down. Where are we going? To a friend's. Insigne passes to Mertens... Koulibaly... Rebound. Here comes Mertens... He shoots... Nunzio! Hello, professor. You're probably surprised to see me, but I need to ask for a favor. Can we stay here tonight? He's my son, Ciro. Of course, professor. Come in. This way. Ettore! Here you go. I saw you dribbling outside. You like soccer? You and dad go to the stadium? Never, not even once. Professor, with all due respect, that is unforgivable. Even if you don't like soccer, take him to the stadium at least once. I will, very soon. Promise? You don't like it? Hello? Is that you, professor? I can't come tomorrow. In two days. Okay, prof. All right. Goodbye, see you in two days. You liked the soup! Can I watch some TV? Sorry, Ciro. It's broken and I don't care to fix it. He's tired, it's time for bed. Come on. - Night, professor. - Goodnight. Sleeping like a baby... what a nice life you have. Hello? Hello? Why aren't you eating? Ciro, come here. Pick some pastries to take home. Why, we're going back to that shitty place? Next time, we'll go to a 5-star hotel. Can I get some pastries? - How many? - A dozen. - Are the cannoli good? - Yes. - Cream puff! - A cream puff. I did it. Yesterday I sent a message to Rosario from your phone. He asked where I was. Rosario is dead, they killed him. How is it? Too sweet. My memory sucks, I can forgive but not forget I don't talk like dogs but understand it all I got some dough, I know what I want I know what I want I ain't afraid of anyone I ain't afraid of anyone I ain't afraid of anyone I ain't afraid of anyone Anyone My memory sucks, I can forgive but not forget I ain't afraid of anyone I ain't afraid of anyone I ain't afraid of anyone Ciro? Ciro? - Ciro, wake up. - Where are we? Almost in France. Come out. Hide here, we have no choice. If you're afraid of the dark, use this. If they catch us, we won't see each other again. Anyway... I ain't afraid of anyone. I ain't afraid of anyone. Hello, documents please. - Vacation? - A trip to Provence. - Enjoy. - Thanks. "Dear Mr. Santoro, "let it be known that for 10 days "I've been hiding Ciro Acerno, the 10-year-old boy, "I illegally took him away from his family. "I'm hiding him so he doesn't get killed like his friend Rosario Amitrano. "The two boys are guilty of mugging a mafia boss' mother, Maria De Vivo, "leaving her in a coma, "and underworld law demands they pay for this with their lives. "Since their families did not report this, I will. "Until law enforcement lets me know how this will be handled, "Ciro and I will remain in hiding. "Best regards, Gabriele Santoro." Diego, we have to go.
