Hey. Wassi, Wassi, stop that. Oh, the idea. Voulez vous me to, to call the police? J'essayais seulement de perfectionner la nature. En effet vous avez exactement I'air d'un chameau. - What's that mean in English? - Same as it does in French monsieur. All right. Comme ça, a little brook, comme ça, a little river. - Ou est Petrov? - Comme ça, a little brook. - Comme ça, a little river. - Ou est, where is Petrov? Please, can you not see I am busy being a wave? Comme ça, a little river, Comme ça, a little brook, comme ça, a little river, comme ça, a little brook. Where is Petrov? Look here, I don't want to be bourgeois and remind anybody that I'm the owner of this company... but if somebody doesn't tell me where Petrov is, this going to be trouble for everybody. He's in his private room practicing his grand leap. - Thank you. - But he does not want to be disturbed. Thank you. - What is this? What is this? - Hi, Jeffrey. Stop it, stop it, stop that music. - What on earth are you doing? - I'm just having fun. Fun? The great Petrov doesn't dance for fun. The great Petrov doesn't, but I do, Pete Peters, remember me? Oh, that awful name of yours. I was born with it, it isn't bad. Pete Peters, Philadelphia, PA. How you make that exasperating noise? What do you got on those shoes? - Taps. - Taps? On your ballet shoes. - Sure. - Sacrilege. At last I'm beginning to understand why you wanted a private room to dance in. All this time I thought you were practicing your grand leap. But Jeff, I haven't neglected anything. Look, Le entrechat trois. - Lovely, beautiful. - But how much more effective it is this way. Lovely, beaut, I forbid that, that's not art. Maybe it isn't. Perhaps it's just the Philadelphia in me. Oh Jeff, I wish we could combine the technique... of the ballet with the warmth and passion of this other mood. Mood? What other mood? You mean this jazz business? Oh, jazz went out with the flapper, that isn't jazz. After 15 years of the hardest work you want to dwindle into a shimmy dancer. Forget all that nonsense, here, look at this. You realize we ought to be sailing? Do you realize that the Metropolitan in New York City is getting nervous? I'm sorry but I have to stay in Paris a while yet. Stay in Paris? What for? Why? Why? Why? - That's grace, that's rhythm. - What is that? What have you got there? Isn't she lovely? Isn't she lovely? I, Oh. So that's it. Who is that girl? Who is she? Where you ever meet her? That's just it, I haven't been able to meet her yet. - Oh? - But I hope to dance with her someday. - Dance? With her? - Sure. Are you mad? Look here, are you sure that she hasn't tried to persuade you to stay on here? I told you I haven't even met her. But I kind like to marry her. Think I will. You're so beautiful when you're angry. Pardon Mlle, I cannot help what I cannot help. Neither can I. You cannot let us up like this. It is not up she let us, it is down. - Up or down, she let us. - It is all your fault, you kissed her. - But it is in the play. - Why, you kissed her out of the play too. Go home all of you, go home. Well, hello my little darling, what you got there? It's Mr. Miller miss, he just arrived from New York. - Hello Arthur. - Hello Lin. You better go. If I ever walk on a stage again. - How you get here? - By rail. I hung over every inch of it. New experience for you, usually have your foot on one. Yes Lin. Of all the humiliating experiences. Did you ever dance with a man you didn't you didn't care about and who's in love with you? No Lin. Why do actors have to take the author's lines literally? And why must there always be a kiss at the second act curtain? As long as I live, I hope I never see another hand kissing heel clicker. Careful Lin, you know I come from a long line of heels myself. But we've never clicked. And it's all your fault too. I was a happy, peaceful girl until you discovered me. Fame, name in lights. Never should've listened to you. I'll quit. - I'll retire from the stage forever. - Again? It does you good to break an engagement. Engagement? Engagement, that's what I'll do. Tai. Send a cable to Jim Montgomery. Tell him I want to see him desperately and I'm coming back on the Queen Anne tomorrow. Yes ma'am. Now Lin, don't lose your head, you have to stay in theater. Never. I refuse to be a bowl in a gold of fish. - You mean a fish in a bowl of gold. - That's what I said, a bowl in a goldfish. - Just a moment please. - Thank you. Petrov? What's a Petrov? Just the Russian ballet's greatest dancer. Oh fine, but tell him to go back to Moscow. The gentleman seems very anxious to see you miss. I got enough troubles without adding a dizzy Russian to them. Just another dancer to swoon in my arms. That's all I need to make things perfect, a simpering toe-dancer. Get rid of him... he probably only wants to say he's seen a picture of me and can't live without me. Otschi tschornyije. I am Petrov. Charmed, I'm Linda, Linda... - Linda, Linda Keene. - Yes. How do you do? - Otschi tschornyije. - To glad you came Mr. Petrov. Not Mister, Petrov alone. Just Petrov. And why not? Just Caesar, just Napoleon and only Garbo. So Petrov too, she's enough. Just about enough. And you, I understand you want to dance with me. Of course, I cannot blame you. But I will not permit it. - Who told you that? - Ah, a little bird, she tell me so. Nyet? Not in the least. What? You do not want to dance with the great Petrov? Don't be a silly horse. Maybe you could, twist for me once. Like so. No, I, I, I don't... - Weest, twist. - Better twist. Oh. Oh, get up, I hate this discords. - Oh, she is horrible, nyet? - Well, that kind of settles it. With me, nothing is settled. Well, I must go now, I must go to Must-go. Funny, nyet? - Oh very. - It kills me. Otschi tschornyije. That lunatic is dangerous, they ought to lock him up. Oh, am I glad I'm sailing on the Queen Anne tomorrow. No, Denise no, I can't take you back as ballerina. Why, you've done absolutely nothing for 4 years. Everything is been so peaceful since you left. It wasn't my fault, Peter just refused to fall in love with me. - Peter darling. - Why, Denise. - Or should I say Lady Tarrington? - No, it is Denise again. Denise wants to come back to the ballet. Oh, she does? Well, that sounds like fun. Oh. But I didn't know you felt that way. Why, of course Denise, you're engaged, you go downstairs and get your contract. - Thank you Jeffrey. - Jeffrey, may I speak you a moment please? - You'll excuse us please. - Of course. Oh, and I'll let you know about the rehearsals the first thing in the morning. Of course, we can't give her anything important to do at first. You want me to stay with the company, don't you? - Oh why, what a question. - Well, then get rid of her. Get rid of her? Remember all the trouble she caused last time? But you just told her, I heard you myself. - I was only being polite. - Oh, dear, dear. - And I given her my word. - Look Jeff, I'll make a deal with you. - You want me to go to New York, don't you? - Why, naturally. I'll sail on the Queen Anne tomorrow providing you get rid of her. Tomorrow? Oh dear, that's so sudden, why... I wouldn't know what to do. I wouldn't know what to say. - All right, I stay here in Paris. - Oh, but I'll think of something, I... I'll, I'll connive, I'll connive something good. Good. - Peter. - Oh... Oh, hello Denise. I feel very bad because I am not going with you. - So do I. - Is your wife going with you? My wife? I haven't any wife. Jeffrey told me it was a secret for professional reasons. Oh, Jeffrey. Did he mention how long I've been married? Yes, he did. Immediately after dear Tarrington took me away from you. Dear Tarrington. Is she sailing with you? Who? Oh, my wife, yes, of course. I'd love to meet her. Well, you couldn't, she's busy with the children now. Children? But Jeffrey didn't tell me. Ah, Jeffrey doesn't know everything. - Imagine, married 4 years. - Imagine. And how many little ones are they? - Five. - Five? Well, twins. - How wonderful. - Isn't it? All visitors ashore. Well, goodbye Denise. - Sweet of you to see me off. - Goodbye Peter. Bon voyage. Miss Keene, I know wants me to tell you how much she hates leaving her dear Paris. She's enjoyed everything about it and everybody in it. All visitors ashore. Monsieur Petrov? A picture please. - One more please? - Alright. Oh, I certainly do envy you Pete, going home at last. I kind like the idea myself. All right, so long fellows. Thanks for everything. - Bye bye. - Bye. Otschi tschornyije. Miss Keene. - Why, just Petrov. - You come to see me go, nyet? - Oh yes, isn't it sweet of me? - I know you come. Petrov, I have been looking all over for you. I beg your pardon. Oh miss Keene, my friend Jeffrey Baird. - How do you do? - Oh, really? Miss Keene, I... - What you say? - Me? Nothing. What's the matter with you? You got a cold? No. I feel like you say, good. Well, you don't sound so good. What's the matter with you? Doesn't Mr. Baird understand Russian? - Not a... - Oh, yes. What? What sort of a game is this? Oh, it's just a game little American boys play. I beg your pardon sir, we can't find Mr. Petrov. Well, you got to find him, he's probably practicing that jig-a-lig somewhere. I looked everywhere sir. Splendid service, that's all I can say. Bring the world's leading ballet dancer on board this ship and he disappears... out of his stateroom right under your very nose. Well, he might be in someone else stateroom sir. What would he be doing in someone else stateroom?

Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know you well enough to tell you the truth. Miss, Miss Keene... You remember the night we met in Paris? Yes, I remember, otschi tschornyije. No, wait a minute please, I want to explain you see... I once saw a photograph of you and... I decided right then and there that I simply had to meet you. And I tried every way but nobody in Paris seemed to know you and... Everybody in Paris knows Linda Keene. Everybody worth knowing. Of course. But I just don't seem to know the right people... yet. Couldn't you do something about that right now? As one Yankee to another? I'm from the South. Maybe you alls from the north. Funny, dogs have an instinct for the right people. How do you like that?

Well I don't see why you should've such a big head, you only had one glass. - Yes, but you kept filling it. - Your breakfast sir. What will I do? What will I do? Well, before you do anything, you better put that breakfast away. That'll save me an extra trip. Oh Walter, come here darling. What happened? You ruined your sweater, now I'll have to fix it.

Lady Tarrington left this morning on the S.S. Marseilles for a trip to America... to visit her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Petrov, who are aboard the S.S. Queen Anne. Upon further questioning, it was learned that the Petrovs have been married for some time. Their marriage not having heretofore been disclosed for professional reasons. That is news for your morning bulletin. That must be the musical comedy star he's with so much, Linda Keene. By George, you're right. Sparks just told me that ballet dancer Petrov is secretly married. - I'll wager it's to that American dancer. - Right-o. And he's been secretly married to Linda Keene for some time. They're a lovely-looking couple, don't you think? - How do you do? - Good evening. That's what I like about boats, everyone's so friendly. A toast. ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny ♪ Petrov, Petrov. Petrov, wake up. Wake up, Petrov. Wake up, we're going to have a baby. - What? - Why did you keep this a secret from me? - What are you talking about? - It's all here in the ship's bulletin. It says you've been married for years to Linda Keene, and the editor announces, quote. It is rumored that a blessed event is imminent, unquote. Why did this have to happen to me? To you? It hasn't even happened to me. Lady Tarrington... Do you realize that you're the father of my child? Of course. That's ridiculous, that's impossible. It's very simple, you told Denise I was married, somebody selected a wife... and now I'm going to be a father. - Oh, well, isn't that cute? - Cute? It's a miracle. I warned you the association with that Keene woman would get you into trouble. As I warned you I was going to fall in love with her and I have. Its all your fault, you go and explain it to her. I? I'll do nothing of the kind. Jeff if you want me to... dance at the Metropolitan, you go into Linda and clear this thing up. Oh, in that case, perhaps I'd better. I'll take care of this. Operator, operator, get me Mr. Petrov. What? Don't you dare congratulate me. Come in. I come to tell you Miss Keene, that we will not tolerate your insinuations. Stay where you are... While I compose myself. I suppose you and that toe-dancer think this whole thing is a good joke? Well, it wasn't altogether the toe-dance, Mr. Petrov's fault. Oh, it wasn't? A man in Petrov's position is besieged by women. Oh, naturally. And there was one persistent wretch who... Well, to get rid of her, he said he was married to you. - To get rid of her? - Exactly. He had to choose somebody and he felt that a person like you wouldn't mind. - So, he used me to... - Exactly. See? It wasn't altogether a joke. Good morning, little mother. Good morning. I want to book passage on that mail plane. Oh, I'm sorry but that's against government regulations. But I must leave the ship, it's absolutely urgent that I leave. Oh, well I understand, but it is a little irregular. Well, I'm quite sure the government would understand. Well, perhaps under the existing circumstances Madam... Not madam, Miss. Where's Linda? Oh, pardon me, take a good look. Gosh, and I could've explained everything. You couldn't have explained her embarrassment and humiliation. Thanks. Now she's going to get married. - Married? - Yes. Marry to a Park Avenue cluck with the longest yacht and the shortest chin ever christened. - You driven her to that. - Me? I didn't do anything. Only told somebody you were married to her just... to get rid of another dame, only used her, that's all. - Who said I did? - Your impresario Mr. Baird. Oh, he did? Excuse me gents, but in a few moments the fire bell will ring. There's no need to pay any attention to it, fire drill for ship's crew. - Right. - He's probably in here. Oh Jeff, did you tell Miss Keene that I used her to get rid of another woman? Those are my very words dear boy... and one of these days you're going to thank me for doing it. Thank you? Why, I didn't need you to explain it to her, I... What is the matter with you Petrov? Haven't you any feeling of responsibility for your art, for your company? Do you realize because of your lies, the best musical comedy star is quitting show business. Oh, is that so? Well, that's no loss. It would be a loss if Petrov were mixed up with that cheap vaudeville. However, I scotched all that and I'm proud of it. You scotched it alright. This boat is getting terrible, what is that noise? Oh, it's a fire, the boat's on fire. Oh, is it? Well, this boat? Ah, of course, yes. What we going to do? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Stay where you are. - Stay where you are. - Don't move. - Don't move, but hurry, my word, yes, yes. - You better get into this. - What? I'm going to sue the company. - Yeah, if we get out alive. - I'll sue them, I'll sue them anyway. Take this thing, we may be stranded on an island. - Yes. - We'll need this for cold nights. Oh, I feel the flames, they're getting nearer and nearer. - Now, let's keep our heads. - Keep your head. - What else do we need? Hats. - Of course. Hats. - We don't want head colds. - No, no. Gentlemen always dress, even on a tropical island. - Oh, and this basket of fruit to eat. - Yes. - Oh, I'll pick up a few blankets. - Blankets. - No, wait. - Wait. A clock, the clock, so I know when it's bedtime. Oh Petrov, I know, I know they lowered our boat. You got to take this, maybe on that island for quite a while... and time will hang heavy on our hands. - Vary it with a little golf. - Golf, of course. - Yeah, go ahead, boat station 4. - Station 4? Have we got everything? - Everything. - Come on fellas, come on, come on. - Don't forget the blankets. - Oh, I'll get the blankets. And don't get excited, just follow me. Follow me. Come on. There. Oh. Yes. Come on Petrov, hurry up. I'm all right, don't get excited. Don't get excited, anybody. Everybody keep calm, just calm. My boat is number 4, my boat is number 4. Number where? 4, 4. Alright, I'm here, bring it down. Let it down, what are you waiting for? Miss Keene? She's back already? Oh, goody, goody. Miss Keene is back, give me her key, will you please? Thank you very much. - Welcome home, I'm so happy to see you back. - Thank you Cecil. You're in sooner than we expected, you, are you alone? Certainly and who else would be with me? Oh, you are a one Miss, keeping it a secret so long. - There is no secret. - No, not now. There never was. Oh, very well Miss. I know professional people. You'll find me the very soul of discretion. Oh, yes, indeed. Just one moment please, I got a surprise for you. Voilà. - Jim, I'm so glad to see you. - I received your cable Linda. You're looking very well considering. - Oh well, you look grand too Jim. - Thanks, I'm lucky that way. Nothing shows in my face. - But why didn't you tell me Linda? - Tell you? Well, there's nothing to tell. - Then somebody is wrong. - Oh, that. A lot of false, malicious gossip. Petrov? On his way up? Splendid. - Cecil Flintridge. - Oh, no, no, no, Jeffrey Baird. I beg your pardon, Cecil Flintridge. - I beg your pardon, Jeffrey Baird. - No, Cecil Flintridge. I don't like to disillusion you old man, but I am Jeffrey Baird, Petrov's manager. And I am Cecil Flintridge. - You mean you are Cecil Flintridge? - - Yes, that's what I mean. - Well, what of it? - What? - Cecil, of the hotel. - Yes, of the hotel. Of course, well, how are you? Well, how are you? How do you do, indeed. You know, I've been at great pains to make you and Mr. Petrov comfortable. - Have you really? That's very kind of you. - Yes, I thought it was very kind of me. Your suite is right next to Mrs. Or shall I say miss Keene's. Miss Keen, what? Oh no. Oh you, blundering, blunderer. Petrov? Petrov? Petrov? - Petrov, do you know where we are? - Wait a minute, don't tell me. New York. Yes, no, we are right next to Linda Keene. - Good. - That's what I thought. Nobody is interested in what you think, if you do. I'm only trying to do my best sir. Well then, do your next best and move us to another part of this hotel. Why shouldn't married people have adjoining suites? - Because they're not married. - Not married? Arthur. Linda, I only kept The Roof open in the hope you'd come back. Since you left I haven't had one revue there. I couldn't find a big enough name. - Oh Arthur, I'm not that good. - You're right Linda, you're not. Seriously, the crowds who haven't been on The Roof since you left think you are. - Oh Arthur, I forgot to tell you something. - What Lin? I'm going to be married to Jim Montgomery. Well, I guess I'm licked. If you have your mind made up that definitely... there's nothing more I can say to influence you. No, I'm afraid there's not. Except to wish me luck. Why, you know I do Lin, all the best, the very best. Thank you Arthur. Eh, is just one thing I insist on doing for you. - What's that? - Give you and Jim a farewell dinner. - Tonight, on The Roof. - Oh, we love it. - It's so nice of you to think of Jim. - I think of him constantly. We had our dinner. What we doing up here? You find out when I do. - Petrov. - Oh yes, Mr. Petrov. Mr. Miller is expecting you. This way, please. - Take this to Evans. - Yes sir. - Thanks Arthur. - Thank you Arthur. ♪ The odds were a hundred to one against me ♪ ♪ The world thought the heights were too high to climb ♪ ♪ But people from Missouri never incensed me ♪ ♪ Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned for from history I had learned ♪ ♪ How many, many times the worm had turned ♪ ♪ They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round ♪ ♪ They all laughed when Edison recorded sound ♪ ♪ They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when they said that man could fly ♪ ♪ They told Marconi wireless was a phony it's the same old cry, they laughed at me ♪ ♪ Wanting you said I was reaching for the moon, but oh, you came through ♪ ♪ Now they'll have to change their tune ♪ ♪ They all said we never would be happy, darling let's take a bow ♪ ♪ But ho ho ho, who's got the last laugh now? ♪ And now miss Keene has graciously consented to dance for us.

I got to keep that marriage story alive Charlie. The only way I can stop Lin from marrying Montgomery. Then you'll have to get a new angle. Newspapers are cold on this secret marriage, it's too secret.. They told the boys to lay off unless you can furnish absolute proof. I can only hang onto this combination. Why, the public would climb of the side of a building to... see Lin and Petrov dance together now, we got to do something. Yeah, furnish the proof that they're married, that ought to be easy.. I have an idea that's so dastardly, it's beautiful. You remember the dream idea that sculptor sold us on for Lin? The one we spent 5 grand on and never used.

Take a look at this old fellow. Oh, I read the paper this morning Mr. Petrov. You won't have to run through the hallway anymore. Compliments of the management. Cad.

No. You... you don't by any chance walk in your sleep, do you? What... how can you say such a thing? Well, it's, it's my bed and I'm asleep. Well... Hello. What? You want a statement. - Well, let me tell you, if you think... - Wait a minute. Better not say that, it might be libel. Let me talk, maybe I can put it more gently. Hello? Who is this please? Oh, the editor. Now listen, you and that cheap outfit that published those pictures... I know, but, but wait a minute, I'm talking. What? Oh, Oh, Jim. Jim, why, why didn't you phone? I, I would've been dressed. I suppose you've seen the morning paper? - Oh that, lies, ridiculous lies. - Now, Linda... I let you talk your way out of that other picture... but that's no joke sitting on that bed, it's you. Me? That's not me. Do you think I be caught dead in that cheap negligee? That's irrelevant, in the picture I'm looking at, there's no corpse. Good morning. Good morning. Jim, this is Mr. Petrov. Mr. Petrov, this is Jim. Jim Montgomery, my fiancé. You've heard of Mr. Petrov, haven't you dear? Yes, isn't he the man you were telling me about? Yes, he's the one. Yes, I'm the one. I'm glad to see you Mr. Montgomery. Oh Linda, the editor said he'd be very happy to retract his statement. - But, how about those pictures? - Yes, as I was saying, How about those pictures? Oh yes, how about those pictures? Now Linda, I don't want to upset you or anything. But don't you think this is a poor time to announce our engagement? I mean... couldn't we wait until things get a little more straightened out? Oh yes Jim, of course, it's only fair to you. - Glad to have met you Mr. Petrov. - Me too Mr. Montgomery. Charming chap. Oh, I'm awfully sorry Linda, we, we'll manage this somehow. But how? Mr. Petrov, the lobby is simply bursting with reporters, they're on their way up. - What shall I do? What shall I do? - Stall them off Cecil. We'll sneak down the freight elevator. Yes, stall them off. Get dressed, I'll meet you in the park in 15 minutes. Alright. Let's go back, I'm tired. Gosh, I can't keep this up much longer. I haven't been on skates since I was a kid. - It's your idea. - Yeah. How much longer do we have to stay out here? Oh, the reporters will probably leave by dark. Guess it would look kind of funny if we denied the marriage now, wouldn't it? - I don't know what to do. - I don't either. The word is either. Alright, the word is either.

Read all about the secret marriage. Hear that? You know, we're about the only two people in the world who don't think we're married. We don't think we're not. We both know we're not. Except me, I'm beginning to have my doubts. Don't tell me I have to convince you too that we're not married. Well, we might just as well be. We certainly can't afford to deny it in the face of those pictures. No, I'm afraid not. The only difference between us and other married people is... we can't even get a divorce. I really could get a divorce from you before I married Jim. That would put a stop to all these embarrassing falsehoods. It certainly would. Peter, you got to marry me. Why Linda, this is so sudden. If we get married now, I could start divorce proceedings in the morning. Well, I, I don't know. You got me into all this, the very least you could do is marry me. It wasn't my fault any more than it was yours. Alright, it's my fault. But you just got to marry me. Well now, I, I'd like to think it over. But why? There's nothing to think over. Alright. But where can we get a license? Everybody in New York knows us now. - Why don't you try New Jersey? - Thanks. Name of the bride is? My, my real name is Linda Thompson. - And the name of the groom? - Peter P. Peters. I beg your pardon, what are grounds for divorce in this state? Marriage. Good afternoon. Oh Lady Tarrington, your suite is ready. - Would you announce me to Mr. Petrov? - Is Mr. Petrov expecting you? - Oh yes, indeed. - Room 2601, I'll have you announced. Petrov, where are you? Why didn't you telephone? Oh, it's not Petrov, it's the desk. What you want? Lady Tarrington, well, yes, have her come right up. Did you say Lady Tarrington? Oh, my word, she can't come up here. Oh no, tell her to go back to Paris. She's already on her way up? Oh, it's calamitous. Oh dear, let me talk to the floor manager. Cecil Flintridge speaking. Oh, it's you Mr. Baird. How are you? That doesn't matter. Now, you stop asking questions and listen. There's a woman on her way up... here who started the whole silly rumor about Petrov's marriage. - Yes, I said rumor. - Did you say rumor? Yes, I said rumor, they are not married. Oh, Denise. Oh, it's you. - So they are not married. - Yes. Well, that is not exactly, no. Well, my little journey is going to be more exciting than I thought. - Oh dear, you, you're not going to... - Oh yes, indeed I am. That's Petrov now. I don't wish to shilly shally... I want to know once and for all is Petrov married or is Petrov not married? Yes, he is not. Thompson, change that lock. Gardenias, 10 cents. Gardenias, 10 cents. Right here please. A corsage for the bride. - It's all right. - Thank you sir. Well, tomorrow we'll be all straightened out. You'll be on your way, and I'll... - be on my. - Where? I'm going to get back to being a bachelor again sort of catch up with my usual gay life... forget all this. - I hope you enjoy your gaiety. - Thanks, I hope you'll enjoy your divorce. Thanks. I didn't know getting married was so depressing. - I'm sorry now I asked you. - Oh, that's all right, I'll get over it.

Oh, wouldn't you like to come in for a drink? No, I, I don't think so. Good night. Well, maybe you prefer a cigarette or something. Oh no. No, thanks just the same. Well, I just want to thank you for everything. You welcome. Well, Good night. Oh sorry, it's way past my bedtime. Goodnight Linda. Jeff? Oh, Jeff? Come in. - Oh, it's you Cecil. - Yes Miss, may, may I come in? Well, isn't way past your bedtime? Oh yes, but I haven't been able to sleep a wink. - I've been waiting up to see you. - To see me? Yes I, I must acquaint you with the varying state of my mind. It feels like a veritable pendulum, to and fro. Then a moment later it swings fro and to. Tell me miss Keene. Are you Mrs. Petrov? Or, or should I say, Mrs. Petrov, are you miss Keene? I'll tell you Cecil. We, we are married. Mrs. Petrov. - My best congratulations. - Thank you. Oh, now I can go to bed with a clear conscience. So can I. Oh Mrs. Petrov, I hope you will forgive me... but in the storm and stress of other circumstances... I rather willfully changed the lock. But may I present you with this? Shall we call it the new key to your happiness? - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. Good night. - Come in. - Peter. Why Denise. Look, you can't come in here. - Why? Afraid your wife will object? - Yes, yes, exactly. Oh, Peter please, think of a new one. Oh, but, but I'm married, really. Save your breath Peter. Jeffrey told me the truth. - But even Jeffrey doesn't know. - Are you sure your wife knows this? - Oh, please go away, will you? - I don't believe you, And I won't budge under any circumstances. Oh Peter, you're so worked up and I love it. - Linda, wait a minute. - Yes, don't go. This is Lady Tarrington. - This is my wife, Mrs. Petrov, miss Keene. - Oh, I've heard about you. I hadn't heard about you. Why have you been so secretive about this one Peter? Oh, well.. Well, I didn't, didn't think you'd be interested. Oh, how silly of you. I imagine Lady Tarrington is quite charming when you get to know her. Oh, yes, she is. Oh, I mean... Then you really are married to Peter? Oh yes, really. Do you mind? No. But I do think it will be awfully pleasant if you would divorce him. No, I'm sure I'll never divorce him. You know, you are a lot more intelligent than you look. Why, thank you. I wish I could say the same of you. Good night. Tai? I'm sorry Peter. No, no, don't apologize, you really done me a great favor. I certainly didn't mean to. - Well, bon voyage. - Are you going away? No, but I thought maybe you were. - I'll send for you Tai. - Yes, miss Linda. - Good luck Peter. - Thanks Denise. Linda? Linda, darling? She's gone. May I come in just long enough to tell you how how happy I am that you're not divorcing me? Linda? Linda. Well, at least tell me where you're going. Alright Linda, if that's the way you feel about it. Good luck and bless you. - Now what? - Linda. She's walked out. - This time, for good. - For whose good? Not yours or your creditors. - Creditors? - Yeah, creditors. You know, the people who come up because the customers didn't? This is Arthur Miller, send up a case of champagne. - Arthur, have you heard from Linda? - Yes, she just phoned. - - Where is she? - She wouldn't tell me. But she gave a message for you, something about a Lady Tarrington. And that she was going through with the divorce as planned. Oh, why didn't you do something to stop her? I'm all worn out stopping her marrying Montgomery. What you ever do to stop her marrying Montgomery? Don't you read the papers? I proved she was married to you so she couldn't marry him. - You proved? - Yes. You took those pictures? How? As long as Linda wasn't marrying Montgomery thought I could get her in my revue, But no, you had to horn in. - So now I lost her. - You mean I lost her. Petrov? Oh, you're here. Let me tell you, how do you do miss Keene? You may be interested to learn that we have no show. - Shake hands with Arthur, he hasn't either. - Oh really? I'm glad. I... The Metropolitan has canceled our engagement because of the scandalous notoriety... occasioned by your association with that woman. Oh, my word, she's fainted. It's just a dummy. I know she's a dummy, I said so all along, a tap dancing dummy. You mean a dumb dummy, of course. That picture, in the paper... Oh. Well, you know where we are, don't you? We're right here in New York City on a wild goose chase... with a whole company of ballet artists and no show and... and all because of you and your practical dummy jokes. Say, maybe Arthur and I could help you out. Maybe we could use your boy in our show. My what? What do you say buddy? Suppose the boss and I could find a spot for you? You vandal, you vandal, Petrov, the great Petrov in one of your cheap medicine shows? What's the matter Pete? You look worried. Oh, I'm still trying to get an idea for the ballet. - It's just something missing. - Yeah, Linda Keene. There's a man outside, wants to see Mr. Petrov. He looks like a process server, shall I let him in? Nobody is to go near Petrov, those are my orders. Yeah, but the man insisted if he don't see... Arthur. - I'm going to dance with Linda Keene. - Is she back? No, but that wax figure gave me an idea. We'll have masks made to look like her. If I can't dance with one Linda, I'll dance with dozens. I think you got something. - The man says if he don't see Mr. Petrov... - You go out and tell the man you're Petrov. - Oh, like a game, you mean? - Yes, like a game. - Oh, what's troubling you my good fellow? - Are you Peter P. Peters, known as Petrov? What an amusing alliteration. I am. - Here's a present for you. - Thank you very much. Oh, now I begin to see the idea of the game. Well, you see, I am not Peter P. Peters neither am I Petrov. - Oh, wise guy, eh? - Leave these premises at once. I'm waiting to speak with Mr. Arthur Miller. Oh well, I'll speak with Mr. Jeffrey Baird, this is Cecil Flintridge. Oh yes, I'll wait. - Hello? - Oh, hello Jeffrey. Yes, are you there? Of course, I'm here. - Now, don't shout at me, I'm in jail. - Well, that's all right, we don't need you. I'm in jail for battery, and I want you to get me out. I'm at the Susquehanna Street jail. Susquehanna. Susquehanna. S - u - s - q - u... q, q... You know, the thing you play billiards with. Billiards. - B - I - L - L... - What is this, a spelling bee? No, L for larynx. L - A - R - Y - N... No, not M, N. N as in neighbor. Neighbor, N - E - I - G - H - B... B. B. You know, the stinging insect. Insect, I - N - S... S. S for symbol. S - Y... Y. Oh, Y. Well, why? Don't ask me why. Look, Jeffrey, I'm in jail. Wait, wait a minute. - What jail did you say this was? - Susquehanna Street jail. Thank you indeed. Thank you very much. I'm in the subsq, the subse... Jeffrey? Listen closely. Do you know where the Oak Street jail is? You do? Fine. I'll have them transfer me there in the morning. I insist that you give up this idea of making a spectacle of yourself. Yes miss Keene, was entirely unnecessary for you to return. - Our man will serve Petrov. - Your men will had their chance. Besides, I'll derive a great deal of pleasure in serving this summons personally. - Linda, was swell of you to come. - Hello Arthur. I want you to meet my attorney, Mr. Russell. - How do you do? - How do you do? He said if he couldn't dance with you, he'd dance with images of you Arthur, take me backstage. Why, Mrs. Petrov or should I say miss Keene? Oh hello. You're back, eh? Well, what you want? What's the matter Cecil?
