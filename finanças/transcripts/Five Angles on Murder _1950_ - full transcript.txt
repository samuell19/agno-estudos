Morning, Alfie. - Morning, Mr John. Morning, Mr Pollard. Morning, Mr Bellows. - Morning. Alfie, your breakfast is ready. Alright mum. Just taking up Mrs Huston's paper. Morning, Mrs Huston. Here's your paper. [ Scream! ] Mum! Mum, mum, mum. Mum, mum! That's all I got out of him for a bit. Stabbed, wasn't she, Mrs Finch? - No. Strangled with her own scarf. Her own scarf? That isn't what I heard. She was stabbed. Seeing as it was my Alfie what found her, I think I ought to know. Is she still up there? Yes, poor soul. All those coppers nosing around. Alright, sir. Finished now. Polly. Pretty Polly. A pity. The one witness who knows all the answers and he won't talk. These are all the photographs, sir. Wouldn't be surprised to find some of these beauties in our rogue's gallery. There is a familiar face. John Mills. Wilson. She used to work there too. - What, in the funfair? In the fortune-teller's booth. This may lead to something. Not so much the picture, but the card wedged in the frame. 'WT Gunton. Private Detective Agency'. I wonder what the connection can be. Send a man down to see this Gunton. - Right, sir. Well, doctor? - Death from asphyxia. Due to strangulation. Been dead about twelve hours I'd say. Twelve hours? That means some time last night. She was wearing a wristwatch which we assume was broken in the struggle. It stopped at ten to nine. - Yes. That would be about the time. And the bruising? Nothing to cause serious injury and all inflicted before death. So she put up a fight first? - Yes. She put up a fight. If there's any more after the PM I'll let you know. But I doubt there will be. Thanks, doctor. Just found this, sir. After they moved the body. She was lying on it. A St. Christopher. - A sort of a charm, isn't it? Yes. It's usually worn by a traveller for protection on a journey. It might have come off in the struggle. Thank you, Frazer. Let's see the boy who found her. I always say, Mrs Finch. You can't play with fire without getting burnt. How can you say such things, Mrs Parker? And her not cold yet. Mrs Finch? - Yes. We're police officers. I'd like a word with your son. Yes. I'll call him. Alfie. Alfie. Come downstairs at once. You're wanted by the police. Never mind what you're doing. Come down when you are told. I'm afraid he's a bit shook. And so am I. I never was so shook. Never. Not since Alfie's father died. There you are. Come in. Come in son and sit down. Just want to have a chat about this morning. Do as the gentleman tells you, ducks. Bend yourself. Now, Alfie. I believe you always took the paper into the lady next door? Always. She always gave him a sweet or a cake or something. She was so kind to Alfie. A sweet soul. Just let the boy answer for himself, madam. Now, Alfie. What time was it? Eight o'clock. Think carefully. You didn't touch anything, did you? Sure? Alfie wouldn't touch nothing. Tell him you wouldn't touch nothing. I ain't touched nothing. Alright, son. I don't think you can help us anymore for the moment. Run along now. You shouldn't really be in here with your boots on. Mrs Finch. You knew Mrs Huston I believe. I mean personally? Yes. I shouldn't think anyone else in the street knew as much about her. We was on very close terms. Not many neighbours do I care to be friends with. Mrs Huston, she was different. - She was young for a fortune-teller. She had a lot of bad luck, poor girl. She had to do something. Mind you, she was very clever at it. I remember once .. - You saw her quite often? Yes. I used to go in twice a week regular to clean up. Last year she was took very poorly. It struck me she needed someone to look after her. Her being such a lady. She left the key behind the door. Those who knew her could use it and had the freedom of the house. I often used to go in and make her a cup of tea. Here's your cup of tea, dear. Don't let it get cold. Thank you, Mrs Finch. I'll just pull the curtains. Beautiful sunshine outside but it's a bit nippy. Yes, it is on the nippy side alright. - Mrs Finch, don't draw those curtains. I've a slight headache this morning. You was late last night. I know. Yes. I was at a party. Professionally of course. I could not get away. - I heard you come in. Morning, Mrs Houston. Here's your paper. - Thank you, Alfie. Hello Polly. Hello Polly. Why won't he speak to me? Don't he never say nothing? Yes he does. But you have to teach him and it takes rather a long time. I'll teach him. You'll see. Now then, Polly. Stick 'em up. Stick 'em up. Stick 'em up. Enough of that. Be off with you. Just a minute. Let's see what I've got here. Ah. Two stuck together. Say thank you. - Thank you, Mrs Huston. Manners, manners. You spoil him, Mrs H. You do really. You are looking tired, dear. Thinking of that poor husband of yours. It's always on your mind. Him lying there in hospital. No chance of him coming home yet, dear? Charles will never come home, Mrs Finch. If only I could get to see him more often. You know how impossible it is. I know. I remember what it was when my hubby went. But he didn't linger. Quick about everything, Alfred was. Get my dressing gown, will you? I shouldn't bother getting up this morning, dear. It's bitter cold. You spoil me, Mrs Finch. But it is nice and warm in bed. I think perhaps I will stay. Just once. That's right. You take a rest for a change. Who can that be at this time of the morning? It's that young sister of yours. The little madam. Why don't she use the key? She knows it's there. Don't you go giving her money. She's got more than what you have. The little cadger. That's what she is. Knock, knock, knock. Alright. Alright. I'm coming. Were you knocking by any chance? - Knocking? I also rang the bell for the last 20 minutes. A lot of good that is. It don't work. Why not use the key? You know about it. I don't take those liberties. Haughty, aren't we? Nobody would think you lived here yourself with all that paint on. Get on with your scrubbing you sour-faced old scrounger. I'll 'scrounger' you. Cheeky little upstart. Coming here addressing your betters in that tone. What do you want? Have you a bit of strong cord? I have if you want to hang yourself. Just a minute. Who's this chap you just mentioned? Him? Pollard. He keeps the bird shop across the road. Mrs H used to employ him to do odd jobs. Out of kindness really. He did up the house for her. A nice mess he made of it too. I told her if she went to a proper .. - Thank you. Now about this sister. I don't listen at doors. But I couldn't help hearing the goings-on that morning. Please leave my house. - Alright. I am going. You'd not say such things if Charles were home. You know it isn't true. - Isn't it? Why don't you ask Charles then? Go on. Why don't you? Don't upset yourself, ducks. What was that about? Good morning, Mrs Huston. I was coming to do that window for you now. Can I have a word with you? Certainly, Mr Pollard. Don't catch cold, dear. It's about that window. Tea is ready, dear. Some people I know like to talk all day. What's the matter, dear? What did your sister say? Come on. You can tell me, your old pal. She said my husband was in love with her. She said that? Then why did he go and marry you, ducks? She said it happened after Charles and I were married. Don't you believe her. Have a drop of this in your tea. It will do you good. The awful thing is, I'll never know for certain. I can't ask Charles. Did I give you the one with gin in, dear? Yes. Yes. I thought so. Won't you have some? Help yourself. You're very good, Mrs H. Very good indeed. So Mrs Huston said the quarrel concerned her husband's friendship with Catherine? That's what she said. It was that time. There were other occasions, were there? Yes. The big bust-up was over Mr Baker. Baker? Who is he? Mrs H used to have a number of callers in connection to her fortune-telling. Some were gentlemen. Very nice gentlemen too. Just about that time, Baker visited visit her a lot. I used to call him: 'The man in the cowboy hat'. It's the man in the cowboy hat, dear. Bob. Come up. And this, shorty, is not a cowboy hat. It looks a funny hat to me. - That may be. Not so funny as walking around with .. A billiard ball on your nose. A smart guy, huh? Bob. Okay, coming. - How about some tea, Mrs Finch? Alright, dear. It's ready. Mrs H was always a lot brighter when she was expecting Baker. I think she liked his company. But I didn't like him. Too saucy for me. There was something about his eyes. Shifty, if you know what I mean. Often I said to Mrs H. That man's got shifty eyes, I said. If you ask me, has a mind to match. Mrs H wouldn't listen to me. Always saw the good side of everyone, she did. But I didn't trust him. He said he came over with the American army and stayed on after the war. He was on the stage. A magician I think. He was trying to work up a mindreading act with Mrs H as his partner. No. A cotton handkerchief is not a 'fair lady'. A silk handkerchief is a fair lady. For Pete's sake try and remember. Sorry, Bob. - We'll do it again until you get it. Let's have a cup of tea. - Shucks, don't you have any coffee? We only serve coffee after dinner. Brush up your memory with that. If you get the code you can't go wrong. I've tried, Bob. You'll just have to give me a little longer. Alright. All this is wasting my afternoon. I don't like my afternoon being wasted. Of course. Maybe we can fix up some other kind of entertainment. I'm afraid I am not a very entertaining person. Too much to think about. Anything else, dear? - No thank you, Mrs Finch. [ Breaking glass noises ] Mrs Finch, I'm afraid there's been an accident. Mr Baker upset the tea tray. Good gracious. However did he do that? - His manners are not very good. Okay. I get it. - Don't forget your hat, Mr Baker. Quite an old English custom. 'Sir, I'll ring for your hat and coat'. Sorry I wasted your time. You wasted nobody's time but your own, Bob. That's the last time you'll see Mr Baker in this house. You are right, Mrs Finch. He has a one-track mind. Yes. And it's a dirt track. Mr Baker got his marching orders? Yes. As far as Mrs Huston was concerned. She wouldn't wear him. But we heard more of Baker indirectly. Indirectly? In what way? Well, it was early this year. Mrs Huston's husband died in February. Though it had been expected, she took it very bad. At that time, I was with her most nights. Keeping her company. One night a man called. Thank you very much, Mrs Huston. You've told me all I want to know. Goodnight. You needn't say who that was. He was a copper. I saw his feet. What does he want? - He wanted to know about Bob Baker. Know what? I can't tell you. How can people behave like that? Don't get mixed up in anything, dear. That Baker's a nasty piece of work. Won't surprise me if he carries a gun. He looks the type. We'll see. Unfortunately, I don't think there's anything I can do. We'll keep this. It may come in useful. After all. You never know. I might want to see him again. Did she take your advice or did she get mixed up in it? I don't know. But yesterday Baker came. Who do you think was with him? Catherine. - Catherine? Catherine, the sister? - I thought that would shake you. Wasn't Mrs Huston expecting them? - No. Did she seem worried about anything? - No. She was very bright and cheery. 'Mrs Finch', she said. 'I don't think I'll be a widow very much longer'. Something like that. I think she expected an offer that evening. Just then. Is Agnes in? We must see her. We must see her, the two-faced .. - Sorry. She's in alright. It's Mrs Huston. That man Baker has pushed his way in. I think he has a gun. A gun? What good will I be? - Come on. You're rotten. Rotten to the core. She's set her mind to it. You must kill her. - That will give me pleasure. I'm not afraid of you, Mr Baker. - Maybe you should be. Nobody interferes with my life and gets away with it. Go on. You keep your nose out or you'll wear it on the back of your face. Come on, Bob. We'll come back later. I could cheerfully strangle her. And you too, you interfering old kite. Thank you, Mr Pollard. It was a great help I'm sure. Did Baker and Catherine go back? They may have. Mr Pollard would know. He stayed on. - I see. When did he leave? Do you know? - No. You see, I left about six o'clock. Every Friday I go to the spiritual church in Harvey Street. I like to keep in touch with the latest. It is truly wonderful when you think .. - Thank you. We'll talk again later. I think that's all for the present. By the way, Mrs Finch. Ever seen this before? No. Sure it didn't belong to Mrs Huston? - Yes. Quite sure. Thank you. Sir. The deceased woman's sister called. The manager broke the news to her at work. Just said it was an accident. Inspector Wilson is with her in the car. - What? The girl was very upset when she heard what had happened. Very kind of the Inspector I'm sure. In that case we must go to her. This fortune-teller. Mrs Huston. Seems to have been quite the lady. - Yes. At least Mrs Finch wants us to think so. - Why? 'Not many neighbours do I care to be friends with'. 'But Mrs Huston? She was different. Such a lady'. Can't you see? Reflected glory. Possibly. I doubt if the sister will paint such a rosy picture. Is this where you dropped Miss Taylor? - Yes, sir. She changed her mind on the way and asked to be dropped here. Platt's Commercial Hotel. I bet you even money we find Baker's name in the register. Here it is: 'R.W. Baker'. He only arrived yesterday. Good morning. What can I do for you? Can we see Mr Baker? - Mr Baker? Oh, Mr Baker. No. I'm afraid he's out. Is there a young lady waiting for him? - Yes. Who shall I say? Must you see her here? - I'm afraid so, yes. In that case, she's in the coffee room. Thank you. Bob. Oh. Miss Catherine Taylor? Yes. We are police officers. You're wasting your time. Neither Bob nor I had anything to do with it. I never said you had, Miss Taylor. You understand we must make inquiries. We hear you weren't on good terms with your sister. Who from? Mrs Finch, I suppose? If you believe her, you'll believe anything. Then she was mistaken about that. Was she? No. That was true I'm afraid. But you didn't know my sister as I knew her. Mrs Finch said that one of the reasons for your quarrels .. Was that Mrs Huston thought you were .. You were rather over-friendly with her husband and had a violent row about it. Oh? She said that, did she? Well, let me tell you the truth. Was you knocking? - Yes. Good morning, Mrs Finch. I've been waiting for some time. Why don't you use the key? You know it's there. I don't like bursting in unexpected. What do you mean by that? You know perfectly well what I mean. Is she alone? - Of course. Cheeky upstart! What do you mean coming here addressing your betters like that? A good spanking is what you want. That's what I'd give you if I was your mum. Hello Agnes. Oh. It's you. Agnes, I wanted to talk. - Shush. You smell expensive. What it is to be a young lady attendant in a beauty parlour. You might bring me some make up now and again. They'd never miss it. I look awful. I feel awful too. Agnes. As a matter of fact .. I have brought you something today. It's about time you knocked something off. I didn't knock it off. I bought it. More fool you. 'Seduction'. Blast. Mrs Finch hasn't lit the fire. Agnes. - It's terrible. Have a drink? Not this time of day. - You can't beat it. The hair of the dog that bit you. Agnes. I went to see Charles on Sunday. Did you? - Yes. He was asking after you, Agnes. He'd be an unnatural husband if he didn't, I suppose. Couldn't you try and see him more often, Agnes? I haven't got the time. It's a long way. It takes a day's travelling to get there. At this time you have no clients. If I'm not busy in my own line, I have other things to do. Got a living to make. I talked to the doctor. He thought Charles may be able to come home for Christmas. What here? It's quite likely to be his last, Agnes. I can't have him here and that's flat. - Why? He's better off where he is. If anything happens, they can give him better attention than I can here. Charles would be better dead. Well. You said it. Not me. But I think he would be. And that's a fact. I can't understand you, Agnes. Why did you marry him if you have so little feeling for him? I was none too keen to marry Charlie Huston I can tell you. He just wouldn't give me a minute's peace. Besides, I was sorry for him. He was going overseas. And a Petty Officer's pay coming every week is .. Quite handy money, isn't it? I tell you, it was because I felt sorry for him. It helped him be decent. For all I knew he might have been killed. Plenty were. So that was it. You expected him to be killed. You wanted him to be killed. You're a liar! That's not what I said. - It was the reason. It goes to show what a low, dirty mind you've got. Anyway, what right have to interfere? Coming round here, nagging me about Charles this and Charles that. If you ask me. Your interest in him isn't too innocent either. What do you mean? - You know what I mean. You were sweet on him before we were married. Don't deny it. I always liked Charles. - Liked him? Ha. That's good. You have a nerve coming here and preaching to me. While you make up to a married man. Agnes, shut up. - I'll say what I like in my own house. You're a troublemaker, Catherine. Always were and always will be. I bet if Charles was out of hospital .. You'd be having him home for Christmas. Well. Why don't you? Go on. Why don't you? You vile beast.. Not very fond of your sister, were you, Miss Taylor? I hated her. Well, do sit down. Thank you. Let's forget Mrs Huston's husband for a moment. What about your friend, Mr Baker? From what we've heard he was .. Not the sort of man a nice girl should be interested in. Perhaps I'm the best judge of that. He used to be friendly with your sister too, didn't he? Until something happened. He used to go there sometimes. That's how I met him. He was trying to work out a kind of variety act with her. As often as not, if I met him on his way to Agnes .. He would change his mind and come with me for a walk. I think he was lonely. How's it going, Bob? The act with Agnes? Slowly. Slow indeed. I'm thinking of chucking the whole thing up. Oh? You'll be going away? Yeah. I've had the offer of a job. A good one? Advertising. It has possibilities. I should take it, Bob. Yeah. Catherine, did you know I was married? No. I didn't, Bob. I thought Astra might have told you. No. I've never discussed you with her. Yeah. I married a showgirl some time back. It only ran five nights. I'm sorry. Waiting for the divorce to come through. These things take time. Of course. I just had it on my mind. I thought I'd better tell you. There is no reason why you should. But I am glad you did, Bob. Come on. Let's go and have a coke. I began to see a good deal more of Bob Baker because .. Because I liked him. He wasn't at all the kind of person I'd taken him to be when I first met him. Shortly afterwards, he dropped Agnes altogether. And decided to take the job. At first he wasn't too enthusiastic. Six quid a week and commission. It's not much, is it? It's a start, Bob. Catherine. I guess I've told you nearly all there is to know about me, haven't I? Yes, Bob. Some of it you may like and some of it may be .. Not so hot. Catherine. Would you marry me when my divorce comes through? Oh, Bob. That must be the world's classic proposal. Ever for an American. Yeah. That's another thing too. Catherine, you know how it is in show business. No. Of course you don't. Well, in show business you have to kinda put on an act. You have to sell yourself. Know what I mean? Broadway, Hollywood. You know. If you don't, they don't take any notice of you. So I've been playing. - Bob, what are you trying to tell me? I was born in Liverpool. I've never been farther west than Bristol in my life. Bob. After that, how could I possibly refuse? Towards the end of February, Charles Huston died. I went to the funeral. In the circumstance Agnes and I were more friendly towards each other. Hello. You've had this place done up since I was here last. Yes. Old Pollard did it before Christmas. Mr Pollard. You do manage to get people to do things for you. Well, I had to pay for the paint. You look tired. I'll make you some tea. Yes. Funerals are depressing, no matter whose they are. That's a nice ring. Where did you get it? Real sapphires too. An engagement ring? - Yes. I am engaged. Didn't you know? You never told me. I haven't really seen you, have I. You're a sly one. Who is it? Nobody I know, I suppose. Yes. You do know him in fact. Oh? Who? Bob. Bob Baker. Bob Baker? I didn't even know you knew him. Yes. Don't you remember? I met him here. So that's why he doesn't come around here anymore. He has a wife already. I suppose you know that. Yes. Bob's told me all about himself. Everything he wants you to know anyway. I'll say this for you, Cathy. You are one for the married men. Bob's getting a divorce. I suppose it will be a nice, respectable wedding and a snug little dream house? We hope so. Yes. Would be funny if something went wrong and he didn't get his divorce. When's it coming off? - The divorce? About April I think. April. A lot of things can happen before then. Pay at the cash desk please. - Thank you. Catherine. - Bob. I must talk to you. On second thoughts, I think I will have Persian Rose. It's about the .. Thank you. Have you Cherry Ripe? Yes, madam. It's about the divorce. A private detective called on Astra. I simply can't make up my mind. I think perhaps, after all, I will have Love Kiss. Thank you. She don't mean a thing to me. I swear. We got to find out what she's told him. When do you get away from here? - At six o'clock. May I? Excuse me. May I see some different shades of face colour? See you then. Is Agnes in? We need to see her. We do want to see her. - You keep out of here. Wait a minute, ma'am. We came to see her and we will see her. Stand aside. You forced your way into the house? No. We didn't force our way in. We were just insistent. Why did Mrs Finch send for this man over the road? This bird shop man. Mrs Finch is .. excitable. You got in, at any event. What about this row? I don't know. I don't remember very much. That's rather unfortunate. We all lost our heads a bit. - Did you then threaten your sister? Did you say: 'I could quite cheerfully strangle her'? No. No, I didn't. Mr Baker did. Somebody said it. No-one said it. It was no use arguing with Agnes. We just left. Did you go back later last night? - No. How did you spend the rest of the evening? I was with Bob. Mr Baker. He was with me. We didn't feel like doing very much. Just had a meal and then a few drinks. Did you see anybody you knew? - I don't think so. At what time did Mr Baker leave you? I am not sure. It was late. Quite late. I don't know exactly. Nine, ten, eleven? Yes, eleven. About eleven. So, after leaving, the only person who can verify your movements is Mr Baker? And you, his? Is this yours? Or Mr Baker's? I've never seen it before. It did not belong to your sister. It may have done. I wouldn't know. Bob. I know, honey. I just heard. [ Train whistle ] I suggest Miss Taylor goes home to rest. She needs it. Who's fault is that? - No. I'll stay. The car is outside. Inspector Butler will give instructions to the driver. Just you run along. I'll be round to see you as soon as I'm through here. Bob, I know you had nothing to do with it. I know you hadn't. Just your run along like I said. You've travelled extensively, Mr Baker? Is there a law against that? - Is this yours by any chance, Mr Baker? No. I'm not superstitious. Here comes the other inquisitor. I suppose he starts getting tough. Why not sit down and take it easy? - Because I like walking. Can't we get this thing over? Certainly, Mr Baker. Just when you are ready. There's nothing I can tell you. I can't think what you want to know. - You did know the deceased woman? Sure. I knew her. A funny thing. She always said she'd get what she wanted when she deserved it. It looks like it caught up on her. - When did you first meet her? End of last season. - That would be .. September. I first saw her in that tinpot arcade. She worked the fortune-telling racket. Tough luck. Those things are made to show a profit. Not to give out. The only cigarettes in town and money won't buy them. I thought you were doing it for sport. Sport? When I haven't had a cigarette since this morning? If that's all you want I can fix you up. What's that you said? Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Are you sure you can spare all these? - Sure. I got plenty. How do you do it? I always get what I want. When I deserve it. I must pay. - No. You do the same for me sometime. You're my friend for life. For 20 cigarettes, that's cheap. You're in show business? - Yes. How did you guess? Resting? Yeah. I was with the local drama party. We had a bad season. Closed early. Is this you? This Astra? Yeah. That's me. Professionally. A queer kinda racket for a girl like you. How come? I just imagined they're all toothless old dames about 83. I don't do so bad at it. If you know a better racket let me in on it, will you? Maybe I could at that. Oh? Ever been out on a stage? Sure. - What did you do? You know. Showgirl. I was just a kid at the time. But you have been on the stage? I told you, didn't I? - Okay. Come and have a coke. - Okay. What's this? That's the finest vaudeville act I ever played in. What sort of an act? - It's thought-reading. All phony of course. Done with a code. Oh? I get it. I'm blindfolded. You ask me what hat the lady in the 3rd row is wearing. And I tell you. - That's it. With a good booking you'll make over a hundred a week or more. Why aren't you doing it now? - It's a double act. It needs a partner. My last partner was a honey. Knew the code backwards. She had a photographic memory. She'd need it. If she was that good why didn't you keep her? She was my wife. In other respects her memory was not so hot. She kept forgetting who her husband was. Well. What's the proposition? I thought it may be in your line. It needs somebody with personality. That's why I asked if you'd been on the stage. Okay. I'll have a go at it. That's Fine. Do it in easy stages. Do the first piece first and then .. Maybe we can have a rehearsal at it. How long shall I give you? About a week. If you don't see me here, come to my house. Number 6 Marine View. Just at the back. And .. who do I ask for? Astra Huston. Astra. Huston. [ Door knocks ] Yeah? Come in. Your lady in the pants said for me to come right up. Don't tell me. Let me guess. I know. The mindreading man. Now. Come in. Make yourself at home. - Thanks. Sit down. I just dropped by to see how things were going. Have you learnt the code yet? That? I was asking Finch if she'd seen it only the other day. A drink? I have something better than coke. You haven't lost it? No. It's around somewhere. Haven't you looked at it yet? - I had no time. You said a week, Astra. Is it a week already? - It's more than a week. Sit down. I just came here to see if we could have a rehearsal but .. There's no point if you've not learnt the code. Agnes. Oh, it's you. Don't you knock before entering a room? Sorry. I thought you were alone. This is my sister Catherine - Bob Baker. I brought some things round for Charles. Some butter and a few eggs. I may not be going to see him Tuesday. But you can leave them if you like. In case you don't go, I'll post them. You. Haven't finished your drink. I'm very disappointed in you, Astra. You're the first American who's ever told me that. Yeah. Maybe. But this is strictly a business deal. What did you expect? Just that. It suits me. Will it take a few more days to get the first part right? I'll be word perfect. Remember now. Parrot fashion. Will the fair lady in the third row .. - No, no. A cotton handkerchief is not 'fair lady'. The silk handkerchief is 'fair lady'. Please try and remember. Have a cup of tea. Tea? Everything stops for tea in this country. Astra, I don't think you've been trying very hard. You are the star of the show. The centre of attraction. I've given you the act. If you don't want to go through with it I'll get somebody else. Alright, Mrs Finch. You can go. Let's try this again. See if we can get it right from the beginning. Don't you ever relax? Sure. At the right time. You know, for a guy that can read my mind, you sure waste some time. Maybe you're just plain dumb. Maybe I'm just plain dumb. I won't waste my time with a woman who's insulted if I don't make a pass at her. Are you referring to me? Don't think anyone is throwing themselves at you because they're not. What's it to you, you broken-down ham? What is it that makes you so attractive? Just the presence of mind to say 'No'. I doubt anyone said that to you before. Get out of here. That is my intention. Don't stand there smirking at me. Get out. Get out! My, my, my. Mrs Finch, there's been an accident. I upset the tea tray. However did you do that? - I guess my manners don't fit in here. Don't forget your hat, cowboy. Like an old English custom: 'Sir, I'll ring for your hat and coat'. You didn't see her again? No. I did not. Until last night. When you went back with Miss Taylor. My solicitor has tipped me off that .. She'd been interfering in my divorce. A private detective had been to see her. I had to find out what she told him. I told him plenty. I bet you told him plenty. You know there was nothing between us. - Wasn't there? Catherine. - I know. You don't have to say. You believe him. Because it's what you want to believe. There's not many who will. Why do this, Agnes? What pleasure can it give you? Quite a lot. I got plenty of attention from him until .. So that's it. Yes. That's it. You think yourself a cut above me because you've had everything so easy. Well, this is one thing you won't get so easy. If you still want this .. Baker. You'll have to change your ideas like I did. That will take some polish off you and take some of the starch out of you. I've never struck a woman but .. - Bob. Get out. The pair of you. Out or I call a copper. Come on, Bob. Please. Just you wait until I get in the witness box. Just you wait. I think you're rotten. Rotten to the core. You don't frighten me, Baker. Come on. You can't stop her. You'd have to kill her first. Yeah. And I'm near to doing it. And did you, Mr Baker? What? Did you kill her? Of course not. How did you spend the evening, Mr Baker? I was with Catherine. - Until when? Eight o'clock. May have been half past. She had a headache and went home early. - What did you do? I came back here. See anybody here? Any other guests? I wasn't feeling sociable. - You didn't see anybody? In a ritzy joint like this? Ha. Thank you, Mr Baker. Don't change your address without informing us. The girl lied. She said she was with him until 11 o'clock last night. Playing safe. She's obviously terrified he might be involved. What do you think? I'd have great suspicions about Mr Baker if he'd given us a good sound alibi. It seems funny to be so careless about his movements last night. There is another witness to last night's row. Pollard the bird man? Yes. He stayed on after Baker and the girl left. Well see him now. - Yes. Marine View. Pollard's shop please. - Yes, sir. Mr Pollard. - Yes? We are police officers. Sorry to disturb you at your lunch hour. That's alright. I wondered when you were coming. I was expecting you. Come inside. It came to me that maybe I should come and see you. Mind how you go. It's dark in here. Sit down. - Thank you. It used to worry me. She had all sorts visit her in connection with her fortune-telling. Exactly. That's what we need to find out. Who her associates were. Particularly if there's anybody who wished her harm. I see you were often at the house doing odd jobs for her. Yes. Often. I was only too happy to do anything for Mrs Huston. The first time she came in was one day last summer. I was surprised at the time. She'd never been in before and I hadn't ever spoken to her. Only seen her. Mr Pollard, isn't it? That's right. I wonder if you could help me. I can but try. It's my little bird. He doesn't seem to be well. Let's have a look at him. Looks like a hen bird to me. Oh. Is that why he doesn't sing? Quite probably. Still, I wouldn't like to lose him. I mean her. See how puffed-up she is. She's on the moult. Oh. It takes them that way sometimes. She won't die, will she? She needs a lot of careful handling. Better leave her with me for a few days. But I couldn't. She'll be perfectly safe. I assure you. Yes. I am sure she will. It's just .. It's just so much bother for you. I thought perhaps if you can give me .. A pill or something for her? Rum and milk. Rum? Rum and milk. Makes the fighting fit. You just leave her with me. I'll nurse her for a few days. Thank you, Mr Pollard. I know you understand these things much better than I do. [ Banging ] The wife. Bedridden. It's her heart. I am so sorry. - Yes. She might go off suddenly. Been expecting it now for nine years. [ Banging ] I'd better go up. She always knocks on the ceiling when she wants something. Thank you so much. For nursing my little bird, Mr Pollard. Don't worry no more about her. She'll be alright in a few days. Thank you. [ Banging ] It's Mr Pollard. I'm afraid I have some bad news for you, Mrs Huston. Your little bird has .. Has passed on. Oh dear. I thought this might be a little consolation for you. It's a parrot. Mr Pollard, I could not possibly accept him. Why not? I brought him for you. Well. Come inside. I hope you don't mind the kitchen, Mr Pollard. The cosiest place in the house, I think. Yes. You are cosy here. My word. I am cosy enough. I miss my little bird. - I'm sure you do. It was just something alive so that I was never really alone. Pardon me asking, but you are a widow, aren't you? Well, no. I'm not really. My husband is in the Naval Hospital. He is not expected to live. The same as my wife. It might be for years though. I know what it is. Sometimes I don't know what I would have done without my birds. Well, what do you think of it? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Her talks. Yes. I taught him to say that. I didn't want him to use .. Well, you know what parrots are. Yes indeed. But, Mr Pollard. I really couldn't accept him. He's much too valuable. Some things are more valuable than birds, Mrs Huston. Friendship. Company. No. I want you to have him. There. Take him. He's yours. Goodnight. That door. It always sticks. - It's the damp. It wants to come off its hinges. - Really? I could do it for you in the morning. Would you? - A pleasure. You push and I'll pull. I see, Mr Pollard. So you got to know her quite well? Yes. Especially after my poor wife passed on. We understand from Mrs Finch that Mrs Huston had a young sister. They didn't get on too well. High and mighty. With ideas above her station. This neighbourhood was not good enough for her. I never had much to do with her myself. I was always sorry to find her at Mrs Huston's house. She always caused trouble whenever she came. Good morning, Mrs Huston. I came to fit that window for you. Good morning, Mr Pollard. - Don't catch cold, dear. Is something upsetting you? No. I am alright. You don't have to say what it is. I know. That sister of yours, isn't it? She's young and rather headstrong but I'm very fond of her. What you need is cheering up a bit. Remember what I said about doing this place up? It will only take a couple of days. I've thought about it but I'm afraid I cannot afford it. A bit of distemper won't cost much. You'll have it as a Christmas box. No, Mr Pollard. I can't allow that. After all, what I can't afford I must do without. Remember, Mr Pollard. I mean it. Fine. Just as you say. Alright, Astra. It's all finished. You can come in now. Albert, it's lovely. There. I told you it wouldn't take long. I brought the old bird down. Anything wrong? No. But between holiday seasons is always rather a worrying time. That's why I wanted this job to wait. Things get a bit easier around Easter. I can let you have a few pounds if it will be any help. No, Albert. You can't afford it. I'm a single man now, you might say. Now my poor wife has gone. Here. Take it. I won't miss a couple of pounds. I shall have my money from the admiralty at the end of the week. Until then. Come on. It's worth a couple of pounds to see the worry go from your face. Thank you. I'll add it to the rest. I hope you're keeping an account. Oh. Michael. Mr Murray - Mr Pollard. How do you do. Mr Murry has just returned from the sea. Better be getting along. I'm sorry about this. He is a friend of my husband's. All very interesting, Mr Pollard. But what about yesterday? Yesterday? Yes. We understand there was some kind of row. Yes. Baker. I never did like the fellow. Him and young Catherine forced their way in last night. So we heard. What time was that? - Just after six. I was about to shut up shop. Mrs Finch fetched me over. It's Mrs Huston. That man Baker pushed his way in. I think he has a gun. Alright. Alright. Don't fuss. It's no use. She's set her mind to it. You'd have to kill her first. I'm the one to do it. Don't think I'm through with you yet. Now then. No such talk here. Be about your business. Both of you. Keep out of this, mister. It's you who'll keep out of it. Out of the house. Go. Off with you. As for you, Miss. You should be ashamed of yourself. Come on, Bob. We'll come back later. - Yeah. We'll be back later. And if you do, you'll find me here. Thank you, Mr Pollard. I don't know what I'd have done without you. Alright, Mrs Finch. You can go. I'll stay here in case they come back. You seem to have acted very firmly. I wasn't going to stand for that. - No. Of course not. Thank you, Mr Pollard. Butler. By the way, how long did you stay? Quite a time. Were you with Mrs Huston most of that time? Yes. All of the time. She was nervous naturally. What did she talk about? Nothing in particular. You must have talked about something. Yes. Did she say something that might throw light on the circumstances of her death? No. As a matter of fact. What we were talking about was a personal matter. I don't think it would help you even if I did. It might, Mr Pollard. I assure you that you can rely on our discretion in anything you say. I realize you were .. Rather fond of Mrs Huston. Yes. I was. Did you ever make your feelings known to her? Well. Yes, Mr Pollard? Yes, Albert? Remember what we talked of some time ago? Yes, Albert. At that time I was so bold as to suppose I had something to hope for. Was I right? Don't answer me now. - Of course you were right. So you thought about it since I suppose? Yes. I have. I thought about it as well. I've thought about it every day. But don't answer me now. I just want you to know I can see your point of view. I'm older than you, I know. Not so much, Albert. If I am older I am steadier than some of the young ones and just as fit. I'll tell you something that happened in The Arms the other day. You know the strong ale? It comes in 9-gallon barrels. The brewers man usually puts it up on the counter. You know what a strapping fellow he is. He'd make three of me. Well, I'm in The Arms. At lunchtime. Not my habit. Just in for one. Then Ernie says to me: 'I am in a bit of a fix'. 'The brewers man forgot to put the barrel on the counter'. Young George. He's the blacksmith. He's a great big lad of 21 and strong. He said: 'come on, let's have a go. I'll shift it'. He huffs and puffs and blows. He can't move it. And they all have a go and I said: 'Let me lift it'. They laughed and didn't think I could. But I lifted it. I lifted it like it was a baby. Then, Mr Pollard? She done me the honour. I beg your pardon? She done me the honour of accepting my hand in marriage. Oh? Then you left? - That's right. What time would that be? - About seven. So, as far as we know, you were the last person to see her alive. No. There was another chap came along. Just as I was leaving. Came to have his fortune told. Who was he? - I don't know. I didn't like the look of him. A bookie. That's what she said he was. A bookie. You know. Sharp suit. A dark thick-set fellow. I didn't like the look of him at all. - Photographs, Butler. Is he among those? That is the sailor Murray. No. He is not there. Thank you, Mr Pollard. I realize this must be very distressing for you. It is, sir. It is. No, Butler. No. The question is, why was Pollard in such a state of nerves? No wonder. After what she meant to him. - But what did he mean to her? According to him .. His version is entirely unlike the others. His doesn't fit with the sister's. But it's not so unlike Mrs Finch's. What I mean is, it's entirely idealised. A man in love? She was going to marry him. Was she? He wasn't too eager to tell us about that proposal. Suppose she turned him down? He ups and strangles her? Not as funny as you think. An insignificant little man who had built an ideal world around a woman. A world in which for the first time he's a hero. And she's a frail, trusting little thing. Who needs a strong man's protection. Suddenly, she laughs at him. And the whole thing goes smash. Your tea is getting cold. Besides, there's this other chap. The sinister bookie. - Yes. Sounded like an afterthought to me. Excuse me, sir. Two young women are here with information on the Huston case. Show them in. - Come in please. I am Lana Clark and this is .. This is Shirley Jones. Last night, Shirley and me .. Chief Inspector Butler. - Pleased to meet you. Thank you. As I was saying, last night we had a date to have our fortunes told by Astra. When we got there .. - Just a minute. What time was your interview? 7:30. Come on, Shirley. We'll be late. That is the house. Sounds as if someone's having their fortune told now. Oh. I don't like it. Let's go, Lana. After five-pence each way on the tram? Not me. They're not coming. Probably can't hear us above that din. Come on, let's go. - Shut up. Someone's coming now. I'll be back as soon as I've drunk myself into a temper for you. You're just in time to prevent murder being done, you little devils. Well. Did you see the fortune-teller Astra after that? Yes. It was lovely. She told me I was gong to meet a tall, dark .. Now, Miss Jones. Did you notice anything unusual about her? Oh yes. She had a bruise on her cheek and she seemed a bit .. A bit sort-of .. - Upset. Upset. Yes. How long were you there? About half an hour. This Irishman. You would know him again? Oh yes. That's him. That's the man, isn't it Shirley? He looks quite nice here. Of course, when we saw him he was worked up and shouting his head off. Thank you, Miss Clark. I'm much obliged to you. We shall probably need you later as witnesses. Shirley. Goodbye. Well. We can come back any time you like. - Thank you, Miss Clark. So Astra was alive after Pollard left. Alright. Alright. I still think my reasoning was sound. The bookmaker hasn't materialised, has he? He doesn't seem to matter in light of the girls' evidence. I'd better get moving. We have Murray's photograph. I'll get Wilson on it. - Just a minute. The two girls heard the row when they were standing below, in the street. Surely. Butler, we are going to the house. She was sitting here. We're pretty certain of that. If someone came in that door she could see them in the looking-glass. If it was someone she knew, she would not be surprised and wouldn't shout. I know. Lucas. Go downstairs, out of the house and let yourself in. Yes, sir. - Come up as quietly as you can. There's someone coming in now, sir. Go over there. Why, you .. Come on, get up! Mr Murray I presume. But how do you know my name? Who the hell are you? - We are police officers. Let him sit down. It's all a mistake, sir. You ask the lady. That would be rather difficult, Mr Murray. Wouldn't it? Come now, Murray. Pull yourself together. What was she to you? How long had you known her? All my life. - Childhood friends, eh? I met her for the first time last summer. But I'd known her all my life. Come on, let's have it straight. You met her last summer? Yes, sir. It was between trips. We came here for the day. Me and the 3rd Engineer. He picked up with .. With a young lady, sir. Not wishing to be in the way, I left them and .. Went wandering about on my own. Saints anointed. I never knew I was such a crack shot. A crack shot? If you could shoot you'd never hit anything with one of them guns. Look. Them pipes cost money. I can't have them all broken. Here. You take your latent somewhere else and I give you this. Though no-one is ever supposed to win it. Does it sing at all? - Sing? It's a regular nightingale. Bred in Berkeley Square. Right you are. I bet that ain't the first time you were given the bird, sailor. You've got a lucky face. Wouldn't like your hand read I suppose? I am not superstitious. Though I was born with a cow. You'd be superstitious if you had a girl with you. Nothing like a girl to make a man weigh up his chances for the future. Why don't you .. Get yourself a girl, sailor? It's early enough yet. Hello, hello. Maybe you can be doing something better than standing here playing the gypsy. Maybe I could. Well now. Anchor yourself there. I'll be back in a minute. Okay, sailor. You steer the course but keep it in the shallows. Here you are, sailor. I feel quite at home. Yes. So I noticed. You've a nerve coming here making free and easy with me. Taking your boots off and all. And you can follow them. Goodnight to you. Alright, sailor. You can come up again. I just didn't want you to think I received anyone. Cigarette? - No, sir. Thank you. I sailed the next day and never thought I would see her again. Yet somehow. I found myself thinking about her from time to time. Wondering. Just Wondering. If she remembered me at all. It was another three months before we put into Southampton again. I said to myself. She'll have forgotten all about you. Why, it's Michael. Where have you come from? South America. - Come on in. It's grand to see you. The kitchen is the warmest place today. Mike, what you got there? Well, you're a sport and no mistake. Wait. Did you see these? Nylons. Michael, you are a darling. Pork sausage. Long time since I saw that. Help yourself. Well, I don't know. There is salt beef here. They're nice too. - Have one of each. Thanks, ducks. I will. Careful. You'll ladder them. - Tell me now. Did you ever think of me at all? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh. Excuse me. Who's that? Just a man who comes in to do up the house for me. Must go and get dressed. Can't sit around like this all day. Yes. I saw her nearly every day during that week. I was always welcome. She said to use the key behind the door. The way her other friends did. It's worth a couple of pounds to take the worry off your face. Thanks. I'll add it to the rest. I hope you're keeping an account. Mike. This is a friend of mine: Mr Murray. Mr Pollard. - How do you do. Well. I'll be off. See you tomorrow I expect. What's this? Taking money from that old idiot? It's just a loan. - What's he to you? What's he to you? - Nothing. He's just kind. Kind is it? Leading him this way and that. Taking all you can from him, the poor, pathetic creature. If he wants to do things for me, why shouldn't I let him? Anyway, who are you to say what I should do? Did you never think of asking? Didn't you know I would give it to you? Sure. Astra. Where's the use of trying to put into words what the heart feels? True enough, I've only known you for a week but .. What's a week? For that matter, what's a lifetime? I love you, darling. You know it now if you didn't already. You know, I think a man needs some corner in his life to call his own. Me been travelling all over the globe. Why don't we get married? The two of us. I can't, Mike. Can't? What's this now? I am married. You? - No. Not what you think. He's in hospital. A cripple from the war. He's not expected to live. It's a terrible thing to say I know. But .. I can't help it. To me, he is dead already. Well. Maybe the next time I come home. Saints forgive me. I'm wishing the man's life away. We just have to wait. That's all. You will wait? But you'll write to me, won't you Mike? But I'm not much at letter writing. - But you must write, Mike. A letter means so much to a woman. It sort-of brings us closer together. You will be away so long. Please write, Mike. Alright. You'll take nothing from anyone but me. You'll send the old'un packing? Alright. Sure, I don't care what happened before. I can forgive you anything. From now on, it will be just the two of us only. Just the two of us. Promise. I promise. But I never wrote. Though my head was tormented with thoughts of her. I could never put the words on paper. I never wrote. Heaven help me. Her husband died in February. Did you know that? When did you get back? Two days ago. We should have been back before but we got delayed with engine trouble. I was longing to see her again. I thought to find her in the fairground. Hey. Hey, where's the lady who was here? Lady? Lady? Now who might that be? Not Astra? Yes. She's hardly ever here. What about her booth? She only uses that for telling fortunes. What do you mean? - Take your hands off me. Say what you mean or I choke you. - Why ask me? I didn't know she was anything to you. What have you come back for? I thought I told you to beat it .. Mike. Come down to the kitchen. Mike, don't be a fool. What's this, a frame-up? After all I've done for you. You dirty, double-crossing little .. Here. There's 50 pounds here. It's all I've got. You can have that. Take your hands off me. I'll have the law on you. I'll pay you back for this you treacherous little .. So I came back too early for you, did I? - No. I never expected to see you again. You didn't write, Michael. You didn't write. You made me a promise. For what it was worth. I gave you mine. Only three months ago. Remember? Three months at sea. With your lovely face in front of me. Was it too long for you to wait? I did wait. I did wait. But you didn't write, Michael. You had no time to get everything straight I suppose? And me none the wiser. You just can't be trusted. You'll never be any different. I can't knock decency into you. But by the saints, I can knock some of the rottenness out of you. Away from that window! Come here. I'll kick you down the stairs. [ Door knocks ] You have the luck of the devil. But maybe it's just as well. I wouldn't want to swing for the likes of you. I'll be back as soon as I've dug myself into a temper for you. You're just in time to prevent murder being done, you little devils. What time did you come back here, Mr Murray? I never came back, sir. I was afraid of what I'd do if my temper got hold of me. Where did you go last night? For a drink. Any special place? No special place. Just around town. See anyone you knew? No, sir. I did not. Now that I remember. I must have caught the 11 o'clock train as I was in Southampton soon after 12. I thought about it all night. Tramped the streets this morning. The fault was mine. I never wrote and she'd asked me. So you came back today to make it up? - Yes, sir. See you here, I thought it was the same thing all over again. You're sure you didn't come back .. For this? Are you willing to sign a statement of what you told us, Mr Murray? Yes, sir. Wilson. Would you mind going to the police station? Play acting? - Well, he is Irish. You still think Pollard invented the bookie? The bookie? No. You're right. He seems to be flesh and blood. I grant you. Should we try to get a line on him? After all, we've seen the others involved. With our own eyes. - Have we? What about Astra? We've seen her only through the eyes of other people. She has always been different. Mrs Finch for example. To her she was the perfect lady. You spoil me, Mrs Finch. To the sister. Why don't you? Go on, why don't you? Mr Pollard. Thank you, Mr Pollard. I don't know what I'd do without you. To Baker. You know, for a guy who can read my mind, you sure waste a lot of time. To Murray. Alright, Mike. From now on there will be just the two of us. We've seen all these Astras. But which, if any, is the real one? Is it important? - Yes. If we knew who she really was, we'd be near to knowing who killed her and why. That's just speculation. Let's get down to facts. First of all, money. - Alright, money. He strikes me as a chap who might have killed her in a rage. Not one who went away brooding, and then returned to kill her in cold blood. Not cold blood. Drunk. - No. Not even drunk. If Murray's description of the bookmaker is true. He sounds the type who might have .. Yes. Remember he said: 'After all I've done for you'. Suppose he was infatuated with Astra. He finds she's cheating on him. Worse still, his rival kicks him down the stairs. Makes him feel a fool in front of her. Yes. He might well be the mean, vicious type. Remember, he said: 'I'll pay you back for this' or something like that. Baker and Catherine are out of it then? - Of course not. Let's see. Four people had a motive for killing her. None of them, as far as we know, has an alibi. The sister. The lover of Baker. Remember, she lied about his movements. Possibly they talked things over together. He decided to go back and appeal to Astra's better nature. She wouldn't listen to him. He lost his temper and .. Well, maybe. Maybe Murray did get drunk and then go back. After all, this is his. Anyway, the next thing we have to do is find this bookmaker. He must have kept his visits pretty dark. But I bet he couldn't hide them from Mrs Finch. I wonder why she never mentioned him. He always gave me a present when I opened the door to him. Always open-handed. You can overlook a lot of things where there's generosity. Yes indeed. His name's Calhoun. He's a bookmaker? - That's right. Ever such a nice man. Well-to-do too. Mrs Huston had high hopes of him. I mentioned that to you this morning, if you remember. Quite. Did you see him last night? - No. But I didn't get home until late. Mr Finch did not come through until after ten. Is that you, Alfred? Yes, mum. - It's past your bedtime. Just a minute. Come in, son. Come in. Was this young man home last night? - No. He went to the pictures. Tarzan, wasn't it? - The pictures, eh? You usually return at this time? Yes. Mum says I must be in the house by nine. Nine o'clock? The time you came home last night? Yes. Just before nine. I want you to think carefully. - Think carefully, Alfie. Last night. Did you see anybody in the street or going into Mrs Huston's house? No. - Sure? Sure. Thank you, Alfie. Be off. Don't forget to wash your neck. Night, mum. - One minute, Alfie. How long had Mrs Huston known this Mr Calhoun? He was a new acquaintance. I know they met several times in town. He didn't come to the house much. I fancy he didn't like to. Him being .. Yes, Mrs Finch? What's that? He heard bird noise as he passed the house last night. You heard the parrot? Yes. He says 'Merry Christmas'. Of course. What a fool I've been. Thank you, son. Butler. Well. What's on your mind? Remember what Murray said when he found her with Calhoun? She shouted: 'Why did you came back'? 'I told you to beat it'. Well? She wasn't talking to Murray, was she? - No. Are you going to see Calhoun now? - No. We've another call to make first. Sorry to trouble you so late, Mr Pollard. But .. I would like to talk to you. - Alright. Come in. We're now in possession of new evidence. Remember the bookmaker you spoke of? - Oh, him? Have you found him yet? - Well, not exactly. We know who he is. His name is Calhoun. Calhoun? You think he did it? Well, maybe. It's just a matter of deciding who went back to the house. See, it might have been Murray. Murray? Is Michael Murray mixed up in this? We found out he had a violent row with Mrs Huston yesterday evening. Was Murray there last night? - Yes. Murray. Of course. He's the man you want. He's known to have left the house. But he threatened to go back. You didn't happen to see him going back last night? Or heard him knocking at the door? - No. But the key. The key behind the door. Murry wouldn't have to knock. He'd have used the key. Of course. Thank you, Mr Pollard. You can see the whole thing quite clearly now. So it was Murray. Strictly speaking, it's against regulations, Mr Pollard. I don't think there's any harm in telling you. This is what I think happened. After leaving the house, Murray got drunk. He 'drank up a temper for her'. As he said. Then he decided to go back and have it out. He knew the key was behind the door, as you say. It was dark outside, remember. So he could have easily have slipped in with nobody the wiser. He'd seen the light in her bedroom window. So he knew where to find her. He could not be sure there was no-one with her. So he climbed the stairs as quietly and as cautiously as he was able. He reached the landing. Crossed towards the door. And then. Careful not to make a sound. He opened it. Went in. And there she was. Alone. Yes. Yes. That's what happened. The parrot said: Merry Christmas. She turned and saw. You, Mr Pollard. Her murderer. Well, what do you want? Not come back to propose again, I hope. I thought I told you where you stood this afternoon. Albert, what's the matter with you? I won't let you go. And love anyone else. No-one else shall love you. I gave you everything I got. And then you. You laughed. You laughed at me. That's what happened. Isn't it, Mr Pollard? Yes. ..f-s..
