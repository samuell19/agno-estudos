"The days of all days are almost unfelt," but there're days that come and are never forgotten… you hear them coming with the breath of wind... that announces the arrival of the new moon”. “My name is Jesús Tecú Osorio… and this is my story”. Stop! Andrés! We inform: yesterday the national army launched a military counterinsurgency operation in the Cuchumatanes area. The campaign lasted long into the night, involving military troops and civil self-defense patrolmen of the Ixil population. At noon today, the glorious national army successfully repelled the attack of insurgent gangs near Los Encuentros. A dozen guerrilla fighters died in the fray, and there were no casualties among our brave soldiers. 5:30 p.m. The right time at Radio Unidad, the radio of the people. 15th September is near, the day of the commemorative celebrations for our independence… Andrés... Set fire to the firewood. God, bless this food which we now take. Bless the hands that prepared it provide bread to those who work for it and hunger for you to those of us who have bread. Give us fortitude to escape of the chances to sin. Make our love for you and the others keep on growing. Receive, God, all our will. Give us your love and your grace, with this we have enough… In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Amen. Do I love you? Of course, you love me. Pancha! You don't let me sleep. Every now and then you woke me up along the night. You did it this way. The funniest thing is that you do this and close your eyes. It's itching, itching. Panchita, do you want to eat? So, eat. At that same time, the subversive groups blew up the bridge over the Cahabón River. Radio Unidad, the radio of the people, tells you the right time 7:30 a.m. We inform the civil patrolmen of Pakob that the patriotic training days will take place at the school instead of the town hall Radio Unidad informs. Now we leave you with the hit of the week. Fresh chicken! Avocado! Avocado that's pure butter! And Moses got angry with the army's captains that came from the war. …And told them: kill all the boys Good morning, Miss. What do you like? Beans? No, thanks. Don't want beans? Half pound of potatoes. Want potatoes? What are you looking at? Today the potatoes cost 2. And don't keep the old ones, those should go first. It's five Quetzals for each rifle and ten for each box of bullets. Those who want a rifle, just tell me after this talk. You are not soldiers. You are civil defence patrolmen, friends. But you serve the country as if you were soldiers. You can't go around like a gang of criminals. You can stay like this until the national holidays. From then, you won't be able to patrol as you are dressed. There are people still in debt. Carlos Chen, Fermín Lajuj and Santos Alvarado have not paid the last installment for the boots. Justo Tun, Calixto Ixtapa… owe the hoops. Rufino Sánchez, the Tshirt. Pedro González owes the bullets, the hoop and the T-shirt. If you have not paid by next week, we'll see how to charge you. Break ranks! And what about you? Do you want something? No. It's OK. Good morning! How are you, little sister? And what? You're no longer cooking black tortillas. Those are the most delicious you do, come on. Are you staying for lunch? I can't. I have to go to work. But I came to tell you something important. I have everything ready for the national holidays. I already told you I can't go. You can go indeed. Look. I've brought you some cloth so that you can make a dress for you. You'll be the most beautiful girl in the party, come on. You know what? I'll send one of the boys to pick you up. All will be fine. Listen, you. Have you thought what we talked about? María can't go on like this. - María is better. - Look at me, you shit! Tomorrow's meeting has been advanced to nine. Bring the money, because the last thing I need is that you're the one who owes more money. - Are you there? - Yes. I was already waiting for you. And why? Because I wanted to play. What? I don't know. - Do you want to play something? - Yes. - Let's play a trial of strength. - OK. - I'm stronger than you… - No… I'm stronger, you're a wimp. - You're the wimp! - No, you! Without tricks! You're already placing the other hand. See, you're such a cheat! - I've won - No, no, you've placed the hand. Without hands! You're a cheat. I grab you 'cause I don't trust you. - I've won. - Neither this way! Don't be such a cheat! See, anyone can win this way! When you left the market, the circus arrived. There were giants of ten meters high. Well, also of five meters high and less. Giants don't exist. They do exist. They don't… Indeed, I saw them, they were huge! And they had very very long legs! They almost reached the sky… Giants cannot reach the sky. Why you say no if you didn't even see it? Why didn't you call me? I didn't call you because otherwise I would have missed it. If giants exist let's go to San Mateo market. You know I can't go, I've got to go to work. You're afraid I'm right. I'm not afraid. It's late, go away. No, let's go. You have to go away. Go. Good night, Pancha. “… And the spirits from the sky and the earth were called Giants of the Sky and Giants of the Earth… And they got furious, and so the black rain began, raining day and night…” Radio Unidad, the radio from the people tells you the right time 7:30 a.m. New Chato 1300 it's not the most beautiful but it's the most efficient… Don Lucas is coming. How are you, Don Lucas? Here we go. - Thanks. - Thanks to you. What's it? A letter from the town council. I told you. You've got to get rid of that fucking boy. You've got to make him disappear immediately if you don't want those who got along come to fuck you up. And me, by the way. Get rid of that shit. - That's not possible. - Not possible?! - And María? - We've already talked about María. She has to be in a hospital and you know that very well. That shit of a boy was madness. I shouldn't have let you bring him here. - It was meant for María to… - I know it perfectly. And María hasn't healed without the boy it'll be worse. Or is she healed? Do you see her better? Look at me when I'm talking to you, shit! Do you see her better? Is she healed? No, isn't it? Of course not, you idiot! See, give that boy four or five years and he'll run away to the mountains with his people and will come back to kill you. So now you have to do what you didn't do then. Go. Ramírez Brothers Clothes offers the best range of textile products for the commemorative celebrations of our independence have you already thought about your children's uniform? Very well! One more step! Please! One more! You're almost here! One more little step! Just one! Please! I trust in you. Just one. I'm going to kill you with Don Pedro's gun! I'm ready, sir. You're not coming today. And that? Today he'll stay here with you. And why? Don't answer me back! Go to your room! And don't get out of there at all. How much love! Have you got out of bed on the wrong side or what? In the circus there is the sabre-eating man, the five-head snake and even the giants! And how do you know it? I know because I saw them. The sabre-eating man can defeat the five-head snake and even the giants! You don't believe me. Why, if all is true? You should have seen it! The snake is very good though I bet the sabre-eating man is also good. No, the snake doesn't get tired because the head pops out automatically. No, the sabre-eating man is who cuts the head. If the sabre-eating man cuts a head to the snake, another head pops out. The snake defeats him! Of course he gets tired! Everybody gets tired, so he also gets tired! Because if you cut one head to the snake another head pops out. So he'll get tired indeed after using so many machetes! I also speak with ghosts. This is the age certification of my little brother and this is the citation already given to Don Pedro. The hearing will be on 22 September. And also the identification card, isn't it? Yes, it's all here. So you've got all the documents, that's so good. This is a great blessing from God. I think all is already in order This means that we'll achieve it. It's done. Count on my help, and the church's as well. Thanks. Good afternoon. That little ear! Little ear! Not now. You don't win me! You're crazy! Leave me alone, you idiot. Forgive me, forgive me. Leave me alone, you mule… González! Come here! Reply, don't stay silent! The army of your country has treated you well? Have we treated you well, Ruiz? Yes, sir. And with you, López? Yes, sir! Have we treated you well, Cuxum? Yes, sir! And what does your country expect of you, López? Loyalty, sir! Do you agree, Cuxum? Yes, sir! And you, Ruiz? Yes, sir! One of the three is a stoolie of the guerrilla. If he steps forward now, he'll be able to decide how to die. Otherwise… I'll decide it. Are you a stoolie of the guerrilla, Ruiz? No, sir. López, are you a stoolie? No, sir! Are you a stoolie of the guerrilla, Cuxum? No, sir! Come here the three of you! I'm asking you for the last time, López. Are you a stoolie? No, sir! And you, Ruiz? López… kill this man. Cuxum, Álvarez, help him! Break ranks! Pick that shit up and clean the ground! González, come here! You, shit. If you don't deal with it, I'll do it. Or do you prefer that I order it to some of these pieces of shit? Listen to me, you stupid! I've been warned from the top. That priest son of a bitch is in the move and making a big noise at the Court. The fact that you feel guilty for your son's death doesn't allow you to get us in this trouble. I don't feel guilty. Tell it to your wife, not to me. Do you understand what I'm telling you about the boy? First, stop drinking, son of a great bitch! You're drunk everyday! Second, this is an order. Get rid of that shit of a boy right away! Get out of here. Leave me. Stop annoying me, I'm working. Come to meet the circus and get to know the five-head snake! Five heads, ladies and gentlemen! And also come to see the dwarves that can walk on the edge of a machete! We're also introducing the incredible sabre-eating man! And the giants? What? They say they have dwarves, but not giants. I've been two years looking for you everywhere. We have to talk. If Don Pedro gets to know you're here, he'll kill me. Don Víctor is going to help us. We've already started with the legal process so that you can come with me. - Don Pedro! What's happened? Where's Andrés? In his room. Pedro, what's happening? Nothing is happening. What did that letter say? Let me see it. Show it to me! “There's hunger for smoke. The paths are twisted. The night shows no evidence of ending. The smoke wanders, drunk, fed up with blood. Flames of hate: black fire”. Hello! How are you, little sister? What have you come for? To bring you your medicines. Pedro hasn't come. What's happening, Juan? What are you both involved with? And this is the dress for the party… Is somebody going to tell me what's happening? If something happens to my son, I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself, but first I'll kill you. Keep calm! I'm very calm. That boy is not your son. Your son died out there in the well. Pedro brought that boy only to console you, remember that. Of course I remember it. I remember it everyday. There's going to be a hearing, the boy has to go away. - But I'm his mother… - You're not his mother. I wasn't your mother either and I brought you up when our mother died. I've never asked where he came from, and I'm not going to ask now. But I can imagine it. I can see it in your eyes, and in Pedro's eyes. You cannot understand it because you're ill and you don't feel well. Go away. María… I'm telling you to go away. Pedro! Listen, the hearing is within eight days. I don't want to have problems. The boy can't go there. If they begin with one, the rest will come along and all the shit from Río Negro will come out, listen? - Juan… - Juan?! Shit! I'm giving you an order, I'm your superior! You have three days to fuck off that boy son of a bitch and get us out of this problem. Then you'll go to the hearing you'll say you have no idea and that the boy went away from your house on his own. It's an order. Otherwise, I'll fuck you up. María, your breakfast I don't want it You have to eat something I want my son Juan told me what did he tell you? Why did he tell me and not you? You're not the same than before You don't love me anymore I want my little boy I want my little child Don't take him out of here He's already accustomed to be here He has his room He loves me He has even gained weight! I don't want him to go, but he has to do it. And why did you bring him? To take him away then? You were unable to save Andrés… and now? It was an accident, and you know it How many times did I tell you to cover the well? No, don't start with that again You had to protect him! You had to take care of him and you didn't! - María… - You didn't! You didn't! You already know what happens if you get out of here. You can! One more! One more little step! Please! Please! One more! Well Just one! You're very near! You're almost done! Well, you're very near! You can do it! I trust in you! One more step! Only one! You're almost out! Just one! Yes!!! I knew you could! Thanks… Thanks… It's market day, today, Laura is looking for you. Laura is not looking for me. Yes, let's go! - No, we're not going… - Let's go! I can't, if Don Pedro doesn't see me here, he's going to fuck me up. He's working. I feel she's looking for you, she's going to take both of us. Maybe yes, isn't it? Then, let's go! I was cutting firewood in the mountains and when I came back the patrolmen and the soldiers were already there. They were killing one by one. We were more than a hundred people, all women and children. And mum? Also. And where were you? We had to go up to the mountains. And you come to look for me only now? Now that I could come. Is it true that you kill people? I've never killed anybody. And the rest? They only left some boys alive. And Jaime? I was holding him between my arms, and… Don Pedro tied a rope around his neck and carried him hanging up. He was kicking out and I was crying because I couldn't do anything. Then, we reached a place with rocks and he took him by the feet and… he smashed his head and then he threw him into the ravine. At the hearing they're going to ask you if you want to stay with me or go with him. I cannot go with you. I have to stay here. You have to come with me, you're the only thing I have from the family! And where are you going to take me? To the mountains? To kill people? We're not going to kill anybody! Don't be afraid! We have to run away from the house. Are you scared? I am. What about? I don't know. And my mum? She's not your mum. We have to go with Laura. I don't want to go with her. Come on, we have to go. Where? To the mountain. - To the mountain? - Yes. So that the coyotes can eat us? Let's go far! You're crazy! Let's go far, come on! Shut up, you silly! No… You're always a liar! Shut up! We're not going anywhere! Let's go! Shut up! Don't you listen to me?! No, I'm tired of you, go away! I'm already tired, go away! Do you remember what happened to your brother, you shit? Speak! Yes, sir. On Monday we'll go to the town council and they'll ask you if you want to go back with your sister. Do you listen? I'm asking if you're listening! Yes, sir. And what are you going to reply? - Whatever you want, sir. - No, not whatever I want. The truth, you have to say the truth. What are you going to say when they ask you how I found you? What you told me. Not what I told you! You have to say the truth! Listen?! That the guerrilla killed my family and I went to hide at the mountain. And you found me and took me to your house. So, remember well what happened to your brother because if you lie, the same will happen to you. Thanks. I don't know what you've done, and I don't want to know it. But the boss sends me to tell you that if it's not settled by tomorrow I have to get rid of you. Go away. Go as far as you can. Go away. Come! Help me to push. Go on pushing! Get in! I'll keep on pushing. Ladies and gentlemen! Come to the Chapín Circus! The Chapín Circus is introducing the five-head snake! The incredible sabre-eating man! Also, come to see the dwarves that walk on the edge of a machete! Come also to see the bearded woman! And her husband, the hunchbacked!

Kill me. “At that moment, Giant of the Earth destroyed the mountains. When he just stepped on, the big and the small mountains immediately were torn. Then, the engendered saw him. Young man… Where are you going? They asked Giant of the Earth. I go nowhere, I just tear mountains down, I am his destroyer, as long as there're days, as long as there's dawn”. What's your name? Jesús.
