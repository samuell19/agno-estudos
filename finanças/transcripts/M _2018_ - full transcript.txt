How to say it in Hebrew ...I was ... a child who As they were at the military bases Girls for the Soldiers , Just for fun I was a kid for fun .For other men , When you are a child , Every time you go through something like this It's like the first time , Even if you went through it the day before Each time is the first time There was one ... who did a lot ...he was A very violent man He would hit me I remember he would hold my head there I would like to confront him. His name is Akiva Katz I speak on behalf of a hundred children Which he took to the cemetery , To the grave of another rabbi And there he abused them He undressed them and carried out his plot on them ...I want to tell you On Rosh Hashanah, I always cry I'll sing you the song Why did I cry? "His soul"! His body "of God" Neither my body nor my soul! Did not belong to me or to God My soul belonged to the one who hit me and touched me My body and soul belonged to him Because when a man is 40 or 50 years old Can do such a thing to you, whenever he wants Your body and soul are escaping together And you no longer believe in anything , Not in your body, not in your soul You do not want to believe in anything anymore , I entered a truly ultra-Orthodox world, literally as a rapist , By chance, and that, I did not come out in question , And in fact, I did not succeed. I always did not feel belonged ,Yes? I, too, would sing in church, you know ?Yes Yes- .All the time , The courage, the process, the crises they go through It's the same as we are .Those undergoing these processes ...now For example, if you walk, with trances on the street All the girls are twisted and jealous The trans women look much better than the girls .Right I know that, they hate trans people "Just because of the look" "Why is she more beautiful than me?" Okay, but Do you hate girls, like, or what? No, not because of that Like you, I see, like, you're trying to abuse them ... like you're returning something No, it's just because I remembered... now I'll tell you I do not know, if I have already lost the torque But I'm with women... I'm exhausted Yes, I'm telling you, I'm exhausted. I, too, have been exhausted with women , And it's not just because I wanted to It's because I also felt something, and I searched all the time , And also because I come from an Arab sector , And Christianity, and with us... of conservatism, it's very very So I'm all my life looking for, myself to understand what I am and who I am , And until I found, as it were, only that I had arrived in Tel Aviv , And I found the community, and I generally understood that such a thing existed , Which is to make a change from son to daughter ... so it's like I felt , As if I were re-breathing, as if someone had returned my soul And it's the same thing! And the truth, I do not? Define anyone... -at what age At age 16, I discovered myself But I made the change two years ago How old are you today? ?How old are you .35 But I started at the age of 20, I left I made this big change at the age of 20 , Because I grew up in a place of followers I've always suffered because, you know ...now When I sing, for example... cantorship I put all the pain in. I went from a young age to this poetry All the pain , Like, a little boy I'm not lying I need the love of Dad, which I pursue to this day To the love of a mother, whom I did not touch Maybe it's also what you find in her We're back to the story I told you a man is looking for someone bigger than him , Because she enters his mother's place, and you're looking for a trans because she's both Mom and Dad! I'm embracing it. !Pretty I paid a price for beauty when I was little Do you actually pay a price for beauty when you are today Listen, I'm Miss Trans Israel, yes ... and I'm an international model and I'm Second place at Miss Trans Star International When I look someone in the eye... I know I'm burning him. and No, not sexually or anything Of all, as if, there is a full that comes to them , Curse me sometimes: they want to tell me Fly away from my eyes ""? Like, what do you think !And that's okay I used to sit in a room crying I ask myself, and I say to God Like, "Why are you punishing me?" For something I did not do Like, that’s what I asked my mom, mine at first, I told her, “Mom You want to have a son, "who is beaten and cursed, and sad And most of the time, and most of his day he thinks, "just how to commit suicide and leave life "Or you want a happy, beautiful girl" "And joy in her part and in her life?"

Mine no- My... will always be imprisoned in this thing , First time I saw Menachem It was in the movie Introduction "by Amos Gitai" No one speaks Yiddish anymore today So how does this kid speak so beautifully? .I did not understand , I followed him for a long time I watched other movies he played in them He was born as one of the Mentori Karta Naturi Karta is the most Orthodox of all the Orthodox Jews They only speak Yiddish To me they were something like that... a bit reminiscent of the devil I wanted to get closer , I came out in question! I came out in question , When a person becomes religious It's called "I Repented. It's an Answer." There is an answer to my life "". I repented When a person leaves religion, it's called "I repeated the question I'm going towards freedom This is what I love: Freedom Freedom from those who raped me Freedom from my rabbis Freedom from people I do not like Freedom to do what I want I have not been to Bnei Brak for years Ten years... more I have not been to Bnei Brak for ten years , Tel Aviv is close, but when you leave Bnei Brak You understand that you live in the ghetto You never want to go back to Bnei Brak!

She does not stop looking at me I knew you had a problem ?problem What's a problem, you know, like you've been through something I knew it, because I went through things too ... so it was easy for me, very easy to spot Because I... quite like you in many things .Right ...one moment It was here?

Now he's asleep. you are welcome What happened when he was handcuffed? .is nothing! After two days he was released .⁇ Two days This is my rape song This is my sad song This is the song of my heart When my heart hurts, I sing it I sang it all the time In my head, while I was raped .in mind .Not loud I loved this tune I loved her so much that she made me Feeling as if this situation is not happening !You know? Look I'll get you in To the synagogue. I went to it for 20 years .I love this place very much ,There They circumcised me There they made me long wigs There they held a bar mitzvah for me That's where I got married That's where I got divorced And there I was also raped I can not go in there .You can The rapist there, he can go in there I'm ashamed to go in there .I'm here My eyes looked , But even when you look... your eyes If anyone's looking at you, you know, you feel it , I looked... and saw two beautiful eyes No, I felt two eyes! Beautiful looking at me I turned around and saw that Parmachi was looking at me Not in one eye, like me Not out of the corner of the eye Two eyes, like two spotlights on me It was strong .Permachi is the daughter of my rabbi And she was my first love ... she loved me Today she has eight children And she looked at me How old were you when you loved Parmachi? .ten years old .11 ... six, seven No, when I was 13. We never saw each other again Ever since we were born... we were born on the same day , Year, two years, three, four, five , Six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, 11, 12, 13 !This ... she does not know, if she knew what I went through She would hate all the followers .I'm sure She's a nice girl A very nice girl If her father was not a rabbi, she would be my fiancée A beautiful girl Beautiful "Permachi and Menachem" !Sounds good "Pharmaci!" "Yes? What do you want, Menachem?" Please, sounds good ... but it's just a dream In the face of Menachem and of those who experienced what he experienced , There's something childish As if the rape had frozen them In the innocent childhood .That they never knew When did I leave Bnei Brak... when I was 15? .15, shortly after I could not do anything. When I was ten I could not pay for an apartment. Or something like that, nothing No one would take me to work Therefore, I could not be independent It was only when I was 15 that I started working... as a courier .In the writer, of groceries and such At the time I was planning to leave , The ultra-Orthodox society I decided to learn something, that I wanted to know more about the open society, about the secular I did not want anyone to know that I was riding a bicycle, for a seat Because we are not allowed to ride bicycles I would go to learn kung fu ? See the light on the second floor ...this is the place This was my room This is the place where I first met Menachem That was about 15 years ago My father also passed away recently. I do not know if I told you No! - I did not tell? My father passed away three months ago Really... Yes, so- Wait, but how do you say it like that? My dad passed away three months ago ? Vanthing? What do you mean I take comfort in that That I was able to come to terms with my father before he passed away , I actually gave him, the truth, it, like He apologized for the things he did Okay, why, because he knew he was going to die, or what? -No Because he realized he had lost his son My dad did things .Ind unforgivable things ... but when he said "I'm sorry That was a huge thing for me .To continue in my life It's not easy, but We talked about everything ... Wait, you talked about things too Now I'm asking you. Very implicitly The things that went through? It's with him too, right? .Yes Now you say, your father said? I was wrong. "How do you feel?" Much better? Much better- !Probably He was at the stage, that he was less of a charge of me : He did not assault me, he did not say No, you're not right, no, you're a liar, no, you're that , But you know about such mistakes sometimes People sit in jail for a long time ... and you took care of your father, and, you did not put him in jail , But you managed to get into a confrontation with him You've been scared of this confrontation for a long time , Because you've lost your whole life , Like, that's how I was in the situation I already lost Everything I wanted to accomplish in my life, knocked me out, from here or there ... and what's left is just You know, talk to... try to solve what can be solved That I forgive him, not only for him, but also for me For several years he harmed you I will not go into that. I will not go into these personal details ... yes, okay... but- ?... There is no, like, lust for revenge Or rather, I accept it, with understanding, what happened After I actually realized... who this was my grandfather ?What do you mean My grandfather came from the Holocaust He was half scratched in the head , All they said, Grandpa was righteous, and that's it Over time I learned who it is, yes yes In time, I learned who my grandfather was, and he was not that righteous He was... a very difficult person He was very violent... towards my father If he did other things besides violence to my father, I have no idea , What you say may be a wheel What did he do? It's a wheel. Unequivocally. Are you sure it's a wheel? -Yes- ,mom and dad I grew up as a child Who laughed all the time A child who joked all the time The connection I had with my mother .Was very emotional .really I'm very close to my mother , And every morning , While I was sleeping in bed Before she would wake me up , So I can go to school She would start , Pray in the hallway In a beautiful melody I only heard from her I want my dad and mom They will see their son I do not want To live my life. Without father and mother I prefer to die Than to live A life that is .No parents They did not answer me .Up to now I did not divorce because of a rapist I did not succeed in my job, nor is it because of a rapist, no I'm not a little more Provocative because I was raped, no , But when I was raped The views of the people have changed Those were the looks They burned me You're yes and you are not You're like you were before .But with three masks People do not see you as they have seen you before When I told my father what I went through, I took off the mask And he wore a mask I was not a more kosher child That's what I said to myself out of fear "! I said," Dad, I did nothing He said: "Yes, of course, I know "... I know, they took you and everything" , After two days , We had to take something, do a mitzvah .Tool for training I used to do it. For the rabbi's grandson : I told my dad Dad, I'll train him! "I always do it for the rabbi." "I will train him!" "! My father told me," No, not you "?Why" I shouted at my father "Why not me?" I felt that my father, did not want me anymore As if some partition had closed : He told me, as if he had stopped "Because you are unclean!" , "Since that word," unclean I became a different person !this is the place I slept there! I slept in a closet like that !here This is the place, look How long have you slept in this cemetery? .a month A whole month I felt like I was crazy I did not think about it much It's going into your head. And you do it Then you're ashamed : I hid here from the religious I felt as if I had decapitated myself I shaved my beard : When my dad saw me shaved "Get out of this house!" ... Hans I do not know what to say... if I liked him , But when I went to fight with him, ten years ago He started crying, I felt sorry for him He was a friend of mine I was a little boy ... but he was my friend, he gave me ...he gave me .Love It was not a good love But he gave it to me What my father and mother did not give me , I really liked it .The touches My mother did not touch me I enjoyed him touching me It was not a good touch, but When I was a kid, I could buy If I could pay for contact, I would do it He listens to what I say? Do you understand? He can send ten people here Look! Look at him, what is he doing? I heard you speak Yiddish, what do you do? Do you want us to photograph you? Only if you do not see my face What do you have to look for therapy in a cemetery? This is not the cemetery. This is the only one. The Breslavs go to the forests. We, we do not have a forest here in the area This is the only forest there is. Katz took children here. There is no one here .He laid them here? On the grave- He laid them down and carried out his plot with them .Nobody knew When you're a kid, you're scared You're not thinking about him. You're scared of the cemetery I went to see my father and cried. It was on Hanukkah He thought I was crying because of God "... Dad, do things to me" Did you cry in front of the candles? Yes- He thought you were excited Yes, because of God You know, the passion You'll complain about him! I wanted him to go to jail? He raped you. Me and many others! You will not be satisfied until he is in prison I tried, did you contact the police? I contacted the police, there is a statute of limitations There is an obsolescence How old are you? Are you engaged? No !Yes? Mazel Tov When is the wedding? At a good time. When you have children, you will understand I have children That's why I'm fighting these people... secular, religious I have no children, but I understand what you mean You were also abused I could complain about my brothers and my brother-in-law to the police ?what My brothers and brother-in-law They raped you? Why do you not complain? Because of the reputation of the family No... but I do not want to do such a thing to my brother It's the hardest part of it Would you send your brother to jail? They have children, families Do you want me to break up their families? Did you talk to them? Do you talk to them? They do not know that I know what they did to me They did it to me at night. I pretended I was sleeping I was in the guide today before the wedding ? In the guide? For the first time Everything broke for me, the whole story floated... and all the things I do not know .If I can get married at all , It's not just this, influences behavior You don 't know what to do and that's it Every day, you probably know it better than me , When I'm with Menachem I'm going with my camera. Like the flutist The injured children, appear as if at a magic headquarters .And follow us : Like characters in a story about vampires They've been afraid to bite ... in the rape itself But in the rape itself you disengage No, you... have the detached section. There is the detached section. there is But... there are some moments... that you're a little It's not a pleasant moment for me. You did not have it There's the rape That the person he oversees is sitting And he... he feeds you, he's responsible . .. to feed you, to wash your clothes , Now, it's not like he's coming, grabs you to the wall and makes you , He slowly, gives you more, gives you privileges , "Then" just touch me here, "then" just touch me here , Then only this and then only this So you become his kind of partner. Without you knowing You're no longer a victim at the age of nine. At the age... you're obviously a victim You'll go home like this What will you tell Mom? .complicated You also do not know .Who to run to tell it No, you're coming home! With a very strange face What happened? "And mother continues": the questions as usual "How was school?" No, and the thing is, I was too good an actor So I went and smeared mud on myself. Like, with water, you know I went and... because my clothes were dirty. -OK .from this. Because it was winter So I went, and with the mud, you know, like I'm... I fell in the mud You know, seat, you know... you walk in the fields , To his rabbi in the yeshiva , When he needs, when he needs the bathroom So he said to him, "Pill, or should I?" Someone hold the door "So he said to him, 'Both Wait, but I'm you... he's busy Are you busy, second? ?what is needed I would like to talk to you. What a small conversion, if allowed Yes, I can also speak Yiddish. ?OK But a little far, you want to get closer. Let's talk, I'll wait, what? - No, okay... - You can come close. Come on, come on, it's okay. I was raped when I was an ultra-Orthodox boy .me too I, too, "it's simplicity!" I, before, listen, listen, before... I was in a cemetery for three days I'll show you the picture of the guy Picture of the guy, it's very discreet ... provided?... wait, okay, and Listen, he ran to the cemetery. He cries all over He tells me, "I'm running away." Because my two brothers are raping me You know what I'm talking about. I know, I'm not talking, but- ?why arent you talking ... I was in jail, and... my fault and not my fault I mean, so you, by the way... it's scary ... by chance you fell on me. I was raped and And you continued the wheel? , And I continued the wheel and I was accused ... before I continued the wheel... and after I continued May I hug you? Because I do not blame you. All right, I understand, thank you. I'm not blaming you... but- Now, you're talking. You went through it sitting .Before, in Talmud Torah I also went through Talmud Torah We may have gone through the same one I know one. I live in Jerusalem, not in Bnei Brak. No, okay. In Jerusalem. Did you study with the Satmars? - No, forget about it I was with the Satmars Okay, but... - No matter, I'm There are many, there are many things, there are things I know The people who did this to me... are hospitalized today What? It's hospitalized. It... I treated them alone - You took care of them alone, why? ,Why? Because I went to the police to complain "I was told, so bring me the address." "His ID card." ... and when I went to the rabbi Do you need to do his ID? So I, he shouted at me, from the other direction What do you mean, he yelled at you? : So I came... like, what, you do not speak " Are you not ashamed "? To say such things You're not here, you're not here, you're not there - Yes, that's what happened once... I came to a man- : I came to a man, I told him , Or you're going for treatment ", take care of yourself , Today, after we grow up, and it's easy: I came to a man, I told him Or you're going, "take care of yourself now And I want a certificate, "that you went to take care of someone "Or I'll take care of you." Pierre Inaf. - And those who went, took care. And those who did not go, I took care of them .I have a question This is the biggest fear I had when I was a kid "You're always told" wheel... you feel it released you- Wait, wait... after I took care of him, yes- Wait, Itzik. I was very scared of this wheel You know, you do not know you're in the wheel , You do not come and plan. "Says:" Okay, I moved, this is it It's during life, yes? , It's very interesting to me Because you touch the layers of my mind It's not just we met. We believe in God, I believe in God What does it mean that you felt you did it? ? "From" Do to me, I will do too "They did to me, I will do too", when they did to me, nothing happened "... so when I do, nothing will happen" All kinds of feelings of grief that you did it... After that, I felt why I did it, yes And at the same time, I did not feel anything. Now here by chance... you fell for the wrong kid ,I have a question , Today, that you are going to bite-midrash And you... you see the boy? He's not from my neighborhood, but sometimes I see him in the neighborhood, yes , And what... - We're not talking. Nothing. Move on Nothing. No connection. If, he's sorry I'm asking if he's coming to take care of you You? Ll feel, like, okay with that Isaac, give me a second Isaac. I talked to him. Isaac, give me a second I'm today after I know- What I went through... and what I did I asked their parents that I want to talk to them did not agree. I explained to them why I wanted to talk to them Only agreed with them We sat, talked about everything, opened... everything on the table next to their parents You initiated a conversation with the parents, without... Yes- The parents, with their children, with the one I hurt In fact, the child did not tell Dad. You decided to tell Dad Yes, I opened everything on the table How did he react... he cried and , He felt better. I hope so, then ... and wait, he shouldn 't be afraid of that- , He should not run away... he did not, he is not guilty - Nothing happened? What led you to talk to the father? ... that I did not .that he will not go through what I went through ?What do you mean That he will not be afraid that the wheel will not pass through him either. , That he will not feel guilty about anything , Which is something, which is fucked up ... which is the one, that they succeeded He's not fucked up. He's fine, I'm the problem ... and you are the problem because they made you the problem- It's not related to him So it's a wheel. But it's not related to it. - So you, I opened everything on the table... With this boy, next to his father I stopped his wheel "You were no longer afraid of prison?" "You actually said, 'I deserve it.' , "Like," I did? Like, you blamed yourself , I did, I deserve it. I was not afraid of prison, I sat in jail ...but I took it as a place. That I could build myself ... not as a place where I got a punishment or something What punishment can already be done? After what they did to me But you know it will not happen to you again It's not going to happen to me again. How do you know? , Why, because I know what I did, what I went through What did I move to? So it's not going to happen I've been in care for four years In a group of 17 people, I do not know, them, I have nothing with them With someone in Bnei Brak That she did the job properly I mean, now, but it's not everyone's a wheel For everyone, it's a wheel I'm not yet, it's not happened yet No, but you know, it's everyone with his wheel ?What do you mean What, you have no sex problems? , Between you and your wife, between you and yourself... between all kinds Yes, so you have a wheel. He is getting married and he is scared That all this will cause him problems in the bedroom I told him, "You'll have problems!" But not in the bedroom He will also have problems in the bedroom Are you sure he'll have problems? !Why? I did not mind Not a living animal of a Jew .Cognition of free women Not my first wife Not the first, the first, no. : I was scared for the first time Do it as it is written in the Torah Not as it is written in the Torah Put it in her mouth? Do not put it in her mouth May I bring in here? Here The questions that are not asked! : My rabbi told me Do with your wife what you want Everything she wants, everything she wants to do , Today I do not, I never did ... with a guy, and a kid, and nothing, but alone Obviously. You're a normal guy! And people who have not been abused They do it too And the woman, if she knows. That he masturbates alone, that, betrays her .no no- : Not cheating on her... - Like, you "I do not satisfy you" You can do it at birth A girl has a desire more than a man, more than you ... she also has hormones, and things, and that's it More than you!

I know he was Satmar He was, no, we lived in Jerusalem It was the history of Aaron I was not born then. I was not born. We grew up in the history of Aaron. We were the history of Aaron , So yes, Dad to this day has a picture at home .Of the Rebbe from the previous Satmar .Yes , And that's it, and he's still holding Satmar ... but he's not going He's going to pray for you. He's not going to Beit Midrash- But we were in the history of Aaron Everything, everything, before he got to Landborne We were in the history of Aaron, I remember I know, Dad told me .Which is to this day a little Satmar The first case It was that mother gave birth to my experience How old are you today? .33 .33 Exactly- I'm 37, how old I was .⁇ Four⁇ year⁇ old⁇ ? Four years old Really? Yes- This means that the first case, I did not go through at the age of seven This means that I passed the first case at the age of four So let's let me tell you ...now It was rape for everything But what's it, I remember later. I came home to ... I came home And there was a day, tell me you guys, if you remember There was a day when I started crying all night and I said I miss you I do not understand how at the age of four you could remember That it was rape for everything I remember every second what it was He was an adult, the man. He was a yeshiva guy. .I have a question Why did you let them touch you? That's the most annoying question .I know ? Answer the question explicitly to you You need some ingredients for them to let you touch I can understand, the answers, but to me That's not enough, and I'll tell you why , Because as a kid, I was a very, very handsome guy ... and a lot of people tried to mess with us. Itai And I never let anyone touch me My little brother goes through the same story Does not go through the same story? What does it mean- He told his sister he was going to die Why is he going to die? Because someone is messing with it And he heard that it is possible to get diseases And die from this disease , I immediately asked Myler to take a pen And will write What they did to him Myler was unable to "... I said," Myler I had to convince him. It took me an hour to convince him "Come with me, come with me to the police." I took him to the police , They then took Mylar, the police, alone .And tried to interrogate him :He told me "Your son went through terrible things" ".They can't be told" Myler was not 13. He was 12 or 11 and a half I cry every day .⁇ About what he went through And I ask myself How can a person do such things to a child I do not know .How can this happen, such a thing I'm not ... but these people , They do not need six years in prison like they are given , In the State of Israel ... that the maximum of e The sentence of their sentence is six years- , Destroys the child's soul .and the child's body, for life My son was raped I, my son went through ... what he went through, an act of sodomy That I had no rest Until I caught the human How did you get caught? We knew he was from ... from Breslav We got to his name We called him and said, "Look. We want to send you books "From the Rabbi of Breslav" "But do not know your address" , We already knew, we gave his address to the police 24 hours later He was in jail ... he said at trial As for the 20 children he touched before Myler That he touched them before Myler 20 parents were silent And did not say anything 20 rabbis were silent ?Why Let me tell you why. I'll tell you why. OK, today I have the answer to why. The answer is very difficult Because I suspect , That the rabbis, when they were in the yeshiva ... to some degree , Understand the child, passed as well ... in some form , These attractions ... and this instinct , And they understand the children Because they themselves went through these attempts , And I can tell you that I was very angry ... very hurt ... very hurt The case of Mailer, because then, he was not only harmed by this person He was hurt by my son-in-law ... which he brought, made a match Is he hurt by my son-in-law? ? Maybe! Maybe! Gelman- Hit the mailer! He touched the mailer. He was the first to touch Myler , And why Myler was injured afterwards? Pulled after this son Because he was already hurt Havi's husband ... hit Myler The mailer came to me, all I could do Why did he experience an escape from him? That's why? Exactly! -exactly- What did he do with it? .We clothed him with a diaper ?what .And played with him Throughout the afternoon .Wow That I sometimes think .that he came out more immune than me And why? He went through no less bad things, even worse than me Why did he come out? Why did he come out more immune? - Here you did not ask anyone. Because he received treatment. , Not only did he receive treatment You're fighting like a lion, I remember. You're fighting like a lion .For him There is a very great awakening On the other hand, there is also a large influx , On the other hand there is a large influx, on the other hand ... on the other hand there is an influx It's less than it used to be. It used to be closed Once upon a time if I had eaten, without a hat and suit like them I would get slapped from the overseer .not today ... start now and I'll continue No, so let me give you more !Pretty! So keep going .No Only the men! Only the men? ? Divorced? ...Yes After a few months? How many months have you been married? I did not count Four months have passed .like you said The pain was not in bed .No But in life. In all your life - I do not know how I was in bed?

There were no mental conversations, no There was no mental conversation. ... there were no deep conversations, I do not know , But ... nice, compliments ... what was today Caresses ... fun I felt that she enjoyed it too, and I enjoyed it ?so what happened She realized something was wrong with me ...All the time .Tension .Tension, survival, that they will not discover ... secrets ... that will not reveal the ... it- I did not want her to find out what I went through .2 weeks before the end, no, no stream We would go to bed in the middle of the day I have no strength left ...I was afraid !No I went to bed to dodge I did not want to make love to her She started sewing with a sewing machine and played music ?Sewing Machine? She sang and cried She listened to music at home And the melody touched her heart, and she cried What tune? Why is it so hard? ... the person asks " ...Difficult for her" "God"? Why are you putting me to the test? , I want to understand "... I can no longer bear "... Yidla, what does this person desire" She sewed her dress in the machine She would cry and I would hear her I felt like I was dead. And Shabbat was getting closer We had to survive the Sabbath Atomic pressure Here I realized it was over, the story In short, I told the therapist to talk to her father With her father He drove to me and stayed with me for an hour I told him my story ... he started crying with me Yes, he understood the situation ... he complimented me on me I have not told anyone ... for so many years And when I told him, it purified me In short, we thought about what to do He did not want his daughter to divorce - Then, she was cold. She's tired of everything. And from me too She loved me But she realized she could not do anything ... a young girl It was not as she expected After a week we got divorced, something like that Who were the witnesses? The overseer sent my brother Your brother was the witness. Oh, that's hard ? It's hard for you to read it. If it's too hard, I'll read it ?Read I can not. I can read. "My dear little brother Shmili" Creepy selfish from thinking “that I have a significant part in your situation "And in everything that has happened to you" "... for my brother and my head" He means like ... who's my big brother too I also suffered a lot. "On my bed at night , And the other also approached me " "But because I opened my eyes" "And he slipped away from him." He ran away from him, and again dared to return It torments me with my conscience. "Until there is no limit and no lesson How about ignorance "? I became a murderer and a cruel pest A lot of girls ... "Yes?" "Doing", a lot of stupidity, doing a lot of lust Stimulated by my brother and head " ... and I thought " "I dug my grave" And now I realize that it was not. "Because if a grave ... brothers, have mercy on the shade" How will I face you?

But the thing that motivates you in life He is not others, but you This thing will not go away That's what it's, you see, I'm missing fingers They will not return It's the same thing, it will not pass You think you can bury everything in your heart So that it does not hurt you so much Obviously it will hurt So what to start with? By taking it out and not keeping it inside I understand you and you can understand me We can help each other I like to dive What to dive, underwater? ... in Eilat, in Tel Aviv You can join ... I do not know- There will be a guide with you It's fun It's calm, quiet : They will ask us "What did you do with the rapists?" Then there will be a sequel And if my brother-in-law wants to pay and show that he has undergone treatment and is healthy I have to answer my brother's letter He wrote to me of his own free will I can force them to get treatment So let's do it How are you, but, you will be sure? That you can handle it alone I tell them, if I do not accept : It's weird that someone would come and say "I touched the children, take care of me" !It's not exist .I did it But you were a victim. : But a rapist will not say "Hello, I'm a rapist, take care of me" , Usually not. But maybe he's going to do it !Do not know There's no way to know!
