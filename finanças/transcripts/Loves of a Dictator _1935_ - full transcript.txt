God save Christian the 7th, King of Denmark and Norway. And his Royal bride Caroline Mathilde. Princess of England and Ireland. God save the King and Queen. How dare he force his way into my room when he only met me yesterday. But he has married Your Majesty in the meantime. Yes, but I didn't think it would be quite as bad as this. The way he behaved just now. Oh, why did they send me here? Why? Your Majesty came to wield the sceptre on behalf of two great countries. I don't know anything about sceptres. I only know I am terribly homesick. And married to that awful boy. I can't bear it. And Your Majesty is here to share the King's throne from today onward. I'll share it for him at 24 hours' notice if he likes. But I am only human and I refuse to share .. Anything else. Your Majesty. I've even lost my name. I don't suppose anybody will ever call me by it again. I never thought anybody could be so unhappy. But how dare she turn me out of her bedroom when she only met me yesterday. They bring up girls so oddly in England, Your Majesty. But does she think that I wanted this marriage? Besides, it wasn't her I wanted in the first place. It was her sister. Why didn't you take her, Your Majesty? My mother wouldn't let me. Do you know what this girl actually called me? Me, the King of Denmark. She called me a .. A spoilt young puppy who wants a good smacking. She did, Your Majesty? But you can't smack a King. Can you? I don't know Your Majesty. I've never tried. Will Your Majesty retire? - I will not retire. I will soon show here I am a man of the world. Go and pack. Your Majesty is leaving the palace? I am leaving the palace, I am leaving Copenhagen, I am leaving Denmark! You can tell her from that English women may pay dogs to make fun of kings. But there are German women in Hamburg who don't. I suppose then, Your Majesty .. Since we all appear to be agreed. The draft could be sent to the Law Office immediately. I arranged that yesterday, My Lord. In that case, it only remains to send it to the King for his signature. I had that done yesterday, My Lord. Our business for the day is concluded. May I take this opportunity of expressing the hope. That providence will soon send us an heir to the throne. I arranged that yesterday, My Lord. Your Majesty. His Majesty the King left the palace last night for Hamburg. Hamburg? Quiet, people. What are you talking about? It seems His Majesty went with Count Brandt .. To inspect some new talent for his court entertainments. A certain Shakespearian actor. And a performing seal. These are stormy times. The ship of state is ploughing through heavy seas. It is hardly the moment for the pilot to leave the helm. I congratulate you My Lord on the originality of your metaphor. The pilot has not left the helm. But His Majesty has left for Hamburg. His Majesty is the owner of the vessel, not the pilot. I do promise you that in my own poor way. I shall strive in the future to lead the vessel on its course .. As I've endeavoured to do in the past. Though I am only a frail woman. Now pour out the wine. We're buying the bottles, not the glasses. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Coming, girls. Drink up, drink up. So you are personally acquainted with the King of Denmark? Yes, I know him very well. Are you in his company often? I am his personal attach?. Tell me, sir. What is the nature of your employment? My employment? My employment consists of .. Dressing the King. And looking after his .. Amusements. That's nice work. If you could get it. Get a doctor. Get a doctor. Get a doctor! Get a doctor. Get a doctor, get a doctor. Lift him up. What's the matter? What's the matter? Very well, madam. Take two tablespoonfuls full of this three times a day. And don't go to bed with the windows open. Tell your father I find your heart in admirable condition. There is nothing serious to worry about. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Madame Hilda. What can I do for you? No need to play-act for me. Come along quickly. What are you talking about? - Somebody is very ill. Somebody important. Hurry, will you. - Alright, go back. I'll come at once. Madame, if you ever have a son .. Never let him be a doctor. A most uncertain life. He'll leave you when you need him most. Come up, come up. Who is ill? - Just a gentleman. Who? You wouldn't know. He is a "Mr Fredericks". Over here. Come along, get back there. Get back, please. That's right. Get back, please. Right back. Leave him to me, sir. I'll have him sent away. I'll get somebody else. How old are you? I am. I'm twenty. - You're twenty, are you? At the present rate of progress you'll never see thirty. I .. I .. I .. What should be done? What should be done? What do you think should be done with any drunken ruffian. Now listen, my good man. - Yes? Do you know .. Do you know who you're talking to? - Yes, sir. Listen, Mr Fredericks. This sort of thing is not for you. Do you understand? Do you mean ..? You mean I'm not old enough? You are not strong enough. Will you take some advice from me? I've an idea you're not as big a fool as these gentlemen believe. Leave him alone. Go on. Very well. With the brains I think you have. You will do without all this. You will husband your strength .. And use the wits God gave you to become a useful .. citizen. And you will run your own life instead of letting others run it for you. These gentlemen may advise you differently. But I've an idea you'd rather be advised by me. Return to your lodgings and wrap yourself in a warm blanket .. And sleep until you can sleep no more. And when you wake up in the morning. Remember what I say. Wine is the water of Beelzebub. And women can drag a man from the gates of heaven itself .. And drive him to the very depths of everlasting purgatory. Where does he live? Find out where he lives. I will, sir. Leave it to me. I will do it personally. I'll have him driven out of town. Tomorrow we leave for Copenhagen. See that he comes with us. But Your Majesty. - He's worth the rest of you together. I want him with me at Courts. But Your Majesty, he is too provincial. I want him and that's enough! Do you know that he is the first man who has ever told me the truth. And from now on I am going to be my own master. And I am going to do my own governing. The reason why I came to see you, Dr Struensee. May cause you a little surprise. I happen to hold the position. Of Lord Chamberlain. Master of Ceremonies. At the Court of Denmark. You don't say, sir. The gentleman who you attended last night. At the .. Tavern. Was no less a person .. Than his Royal Majesty the King of Denmark. You don't say, sir. To put it briefly, I was impressed by your skill. So I took it upon myself. To persuade His Majesty. To demand your services at Court. You did this for me? I have an eye for talent. Not only in the theatre. Very obliging of you, sir. I hope I shall never have cause to regret it. I hope so too, sir. The Royal party. Leaves at 2 o'clock. Can you be ready? I'm ready now. I've already packed. You're packed? - Why, yes. I haven't very much. What did you pack for? To go to Copenhagen. Who told you you were going to Copenhagen? To tell you the truth, I made up my mind to go to Copenhagen. When I first saw His Majesty's extremely decorative cane last night. 2 o'clock, did you say, sir? You might have saved me the trouble of coming. Mightn't you? - So I might. I apologise. Well, Friedrich Struensee. Today you travel with the King. Brandt, Brandt. What a nice little surprise they are going to have in Copenhagen, eh? I go away a mere boy. And I come back .. a King. Imagine my dear mother's surprise and Guldberg's. When they see me come back and I do my own governing. Yes, sir. I have no doubt it will all be great fun. Where is that doctor? You got him, sir? Oh good. A proper lady was the Ophelia. Your humble servant and the Holy One. Cannot account. Well. Here I am. Today marks the beginning of Denmark's golden age. And what may I ask will be Your Majesty's first step? Oh. I don't quite know. If you were a King, what would you do? If I were a King? - Yes. If I were a King, Your Majesty I should first assert the divine right of Kings. Yes. Do you know doctor, there are common people about nowadays .. Who say there is no such thing. I can only deplore their existence. From now on, I stand alone. You'll tell me what to say, won't you? Your Majesty. I'll show her. - Who, Your Majesty? That doesn't matter. Tell him it's ready. The chocolate is ready. Thank you. The Royal chocolate. What chocolate? His Majesty's chocolate. Very well. Ah. Is it alright? What, Your Majesty? - Why, chocolate. My chocolate. Delicious, Your Majesty. Forgive me, Your Majesty. I'm not yet accustomed to such important duties. Count Guldberg. Your Majesty sent for me? - Yes, Count Guldberg. Your Majesty wishes to consult me about something? Why of course I do. Let me see. What was it I wanted to consult you about? It was about something important. A matter of State too. Council is in session, Your Majesty. Perhaps I had better return to it .. While Your Majesty thinks out his little problem and finishes his breakfast. No, no. Don't go. Perhaps Your Majesty does not realize that I am a busy man. Busy with Your Majesty's affairs. There are a great many things for me to do. It may interest Your Majesty to learn .. That there is a serious famine in the kingdom, for example. The people are in a dangerous state of unrest, for example. There is an alarming epidemic of smallpox for example. Shall I continue, Your Majesty? No, that's alright. I think perhaps you'd better go now. While I am here perhaps Your Majesty will be good enough to sign this? It will save a great deal of trouble. I won't bother Your Majesty by explaining the contents. What's in this then? Suppose I go into that when Your Majesty has more time. At the moment, if Your Majesty will be good enough to sign. I won't sign. Struensee, come with me. Struensee? Doctor Struensee, My Lord. Doctor Struensee? His Majesty's medical advisor. Medical advisor? Medical advisor. But Your Majesty, that is the President's chair. I am the President. Your Majesty seeks the bathroom? - Quiet! Well gentlemen, will you sit down.? Well gentlemen, you are not accustomed to seeing me at these meetings. In future however, I propose to take a rather more active part .. In my own affairs. From now on I intend to do my own governing. Who is this man? This is my new physician. I have just engaged him. Not a moment too soon. To business. Let me see. What were we discussing? We were discussing the growth of smallpox in Copenhagen, your Majesty. And debating the merit of the Court moving to the castle of Friedrichsburg. Until the epidemic shall have abated. Perhaps I might humbly ask for the benefit of your advice? No doubt you will appreciate the allied problems that are affected? Yes, yes. Quite. Of course. Yes. Yes. Quite, of course. On thinking the matter over. I have decided that the court shall remain here. The importance of preserving the court's prestige cannot be exaggerated. The importance of preserving its health can. That is all Your Majesty? - No, it isn't all. The castle of Friedrichsburg shall be transformed immediately .. Into a quarantine hospital for the children of the poor. But Your Majesty, that is impossible. Friedrichsburg is one of the richest properties in the country. Good heavens, boy. What's come over you? Do you think I will allow .. - Silence! Have the necessary papers ready for me for signature .. And bring them to me. Was that alright? - Splendid, Your Majesty. I showed them I was a King, didn't I. - You did, sir. They've not seen the last of me, either. Her Majesty's compliments. Her Majesty is unable to see you. Why not? Her Majesty did not find it necessary to say why not. But I come by order of the King. Possibly, that is why. Why, that's very clever of you, doctor. You seem to know a great deal about women. In my profession, we have to know a little of everything. Do you even know .. Latin? A little. And geography? - A little. Do you happen to know the geography is Italy? A little. Let me examine you. - Yes. Where is the east tower? - In the east. Correct. And the third floor of the east tower? Up the third flight of stairs I believe. - Correct. And the second room on the left? I think I could find it on the map. Do you think you could find it in actual fact? That would depend on the time of day. Or night. Tonight at eleven, do you think? Ahem. No. No? - Certainly not. Oh! I beg your pardon. - Just a moment. Sit down. Open your mouth. - Ah. Yes. You've a very bad throat indeed. A dangerous throat. I advise you to take care of it. You had better see a doctor about it. In the east tower. At eleven o'clock this evening. Good day, doctor. Ah, Count Guldberg. I hear you are to have a very important patient. Ah no, not this lady. Her Majesty the Queen. - Is she ill? Well, not exactly. But she is in a state of great agitation. She has lost her dog. No? No. - Yes. It has been missing all day. Her Majesty is distracted. Dear me, something should be done about it. Something must be done about it. Something probably will. You Majesty. She is found. They found her. - Where is she? There is a man outside with her. - Well, bring them in. My darling, where have you been? Where have you been? I'm so grateful to you. Where did you find her? Who are you? My name is Struensee. His Majesty's physician. I've heard about you. I attempted to secure an audience with you before. I refused it. I know. So I had to wait until I could secure an introduction from a friend of yours. Your best friend. Perhaps your only friend? You are very observant, doctor. Forgive me. Why are you here? On very impertinent business, Your Majesty. Did the King send you? Yes, but on my own suggestion. - Yours? Your Majesty. I too am a stranger in Denmark. What do you want of me? May I be impertinent, Your Majesty? I want you to end your quarrel with the King. Have you anything else to say? - Yes, madam. Would you look out a moment with me, Your Majesty? Under all that lovely vastness. Even a Queen seems very tiny. And a quarrel .. tinier still. You've a whole lifetime before you, madam. A lifetime of crawling under that sky. A lifetime of empty majesty. It would be very dull. "Empty majesty". That sounds like treason. I've always been taught to take it for granted .. That Royalty justifies itself. The world is changing, Your Majesty. People no longer take much for granted. Thinking is coming into fashion. Wearing a crown no longer turns a pretty woman into a great Queen. What do you want me to do? Work. What work can I do here? Have you courage? Yes. Then perhaps, who knows? You may help to build another England here. I? There is plenty to be done. First, you must build another King. - Why not? Change Christian? Try. Try and perhaps a miracle will happen. Here is real work for you. What's a petty quarrel compared with this? Will you start? Will you try? Countess Bulow presents Viscount Stanley. Countess Bulow presents Viscount Juelle. Countess Verdelles presents Viscount Mosting. Countess Verdelles presents Viscount Radlow. What is worrying you? - This suit, sir. What's the matter with it? - Why, they are all the same. Well, what about it? They are all exactly alike, sir. That was the intention. Silence! Listen to me, will you. Listen to me. Listen to me, will you! So your taxes are too high are they? You know well they are. Don't listen to him. He's one of them. I'm one of them and you despise me. Yes! Well, I despise you! Because you've put up with him for so long. Are you men or beasts of burden? That you work fourteen hours a day and go to bed hungry. I doubt I'd have put up with if I'd been one of you. But what are we to do, then? What do you think we're here for? You are very brave suddenly. You find two poor wretched women alone in a carriage .. And you're brave enough to threaten them. Yes. But what shall we do? Go as free men. Not as slaves. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. You are too late. Yes, my friends. You are too late. - What are you talking about? What do you mean? - I'll say what I mean. You locked the stable door after the horse has gone. The salt tax is going to be removed. The meat tax is going to be removed. Only this morning, His Majesty the King told me of his decision. Yes my friends, you may well look dismayed. Though heave knows, you don't deserve it. That you have a King who is more loyal to you than you are to him. Why should we believe that? So you can go on paying taxes if you want to. Go home my friends, and thank heaven for giving you a King .. Who looks after you better than you look after yourselves. God save the King! God save the King! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! What will happen when they find out? When they find out that your promises don't come true. I have no idea. I didn't think so far ahead. Things shouldn't be in this state. Can't anything be done to stop this .. bloodshed and killing? There is everything to be done. I know that now. Well? - Well. The people out there must be made aware that they are human beings, not animals. Washed and clothed and fed. And paid wages just above the rewards bestowed on the beasts of the field .. And then, and not before then .. Will they cease to act like animals. They must be taught that they have minds of their own. They must be guided by their own right thinking. Yes. They must learn that the world can only find its salvation in self-respect. But Guldberg says that's dangerous. Didn't I tell you the world was changing? I haven't the power to do it alone. What could you do with allies? With me as an ally? I could change the face of Denmark. In the name of His Majesty King Christian the 7th of Denmark. It is decreed that from this day the meat tax shall be abolished. It is furthermore decreed. That from this day the salt and corn taxes shall be abolished. Furthermore, it is decreed. That from this day a tax shall be imposed. On all castles, estates and park lands which have hitherto remained tax free. Ordained in Copenhagen this 83rd day of the year 1771. Singed: Christian of Denmark. Long live the King indeed. A precious lot he had to do with it. Give him a pen and he'll sign his name to anything. You ought to know. - "Long live the King". As though he has ever done anything. As though he's ever likely to. You are talking about my husband, madam. Accept my condolences, and I'll accept yours. I am also talking about my son. If I may be allowed to correct Your Majesties. I respectfully submit .. That Your Majesties are really talking about a certain doctor from Hamburg. I was waiting for that. That I presume is what you want to see me about? And you presume correctly. - I'm ready. Very well. This fellow is dangerous. He's a careerist and a self-seeker and he's no fool. He has the shrewdness of the gutter, especially in his eyes. He means to feather his own nest. I warned you that man would betray his dearest friends. I believe Her Majesty wishes to suggest .. That she disapproves of doctor Struensee. I have not your experience, madam. That I could not hope to have for another forty years at least. In the meantime, I only have my own immature instinct to advise me. And what advice does it offer, pray? - It advises me, madam. Your dislike of Dr Struensee is neither disinterested nor wholly free from fear. That despite your long experience. You may not have met a man like this before. Yet here is a man in advance of his generation. A man far less self-seeking than .. Noble ladies and gentlemen who at this moment tremble at the idea of taxation. It may not have occurred to Your Majesty that unlike noble ladies and gentlemen. The doctor has nothing to lose. - That can easily be remedied. I want to see Dr Struensee. What are you going to do? - You shall see, madam. May I be allowed to conjecture, Your Majesty? Just for fun. You may. Then I think Your Majesty proposes to try a little experiment. Proposes in fact, to offer Dr Struensee some of the privileges of aristocracy. What? Outrageous! Nevertheless, Count Guldberg is right. That is exactly what I propose. I think Her Majesty is confident. That Dr Struensee will refuse. And I am equally confidant that .. We shall see. Dr Struensee. Your Majesty sent for me? - Yes, doctor. We have been discussing the value of your advice on the recent legislation. And I have decided to recommend His Majesty .. To make some official acknowledgement of your services. We might for instance offer you the estate of Hartenberg. Hartenberg? That is if you wish to accept. What do you say? It is a most beautiful estate, isn't it? - Yes. How large is it? Thousands of acres. Are there may tenants and serfs? Hundreds. And it would be mine? Absolutely mine? It would. Your Majesty, I .. never expected recognition of this kind. I find it difficult to express my sense of obligation. Then you accept? Why certainly I accept. Thank you, doctor. You may go now. My sincere gratitude to Your Majesty. And to you too, My Lord. I think that concludes our business, Your Majesty. Goodnight, Your Majesty. His Excellency the Marquis de Langevin. Ambassador from his Royal Majesty the King of France. His Excellency Said Ali Pasha. Ambassador of his Imperial Majesty, the Sultan. His Excellency Vladimir Alexander. Of St Petersburg. Ambassador from his Royal Majesty the King of Russia. Come in. Pardon me, doctor. His Majesty has sent me here for you. He is ready to make the investiture. I will be with you at once. A nice little place you've got here. I like it. Now just think, if I hadn't been in Hamburg .. This might never have happened. - Think of that. Not that you don't deserve it. Thank you. The story has a charming romantic quality. From Doctor to Count. From radical reformer to landowner. I always admired the men who have the courage to change their convictions. And I always admire men who are unhampered by any convictions whatever. His Excellency, Sir Murray Keith. Ambassador from His Royal Majesty the King of England and Ireland. All is well. Pray it is Sir Murray Keith dressed as a woman. Perhaps it's customary where the English Ambassador comes from, Your Majesty. The men to wear the skirts, and the women to wear the breeches. If they must wear skirts at least they needn't be so short. It is positively embarrassing. We, Christian the 7th. King of Denmark and Norway by the grace of God. Hereby invest you, Friedrich Struensee, with the title of Count. And in recognition of your services to ourselves. We bestow upon you the castle and estates of Hartenberg. May God preserve you. You Majesty. My Lords, ladies and gentlemen. I am deeply conscious of the honour Your Majesty does me. And I pray that I shall be able to demonstrate my sincerity and gratitude. In the service of Your Majesty. And your country. I should like to make this occasion. A memorable one. And in view of the inadequate organisation. At present existing to combat sickness and disease in Denmark. I think I might serve Your Majesty's interests. By presenting this castle to the nation. As a foundling hospital. Of which I hope Your Majesties will do the honour to be patients. I should like to make this occasion as memorable to others .. As it is to me. And I intend, therefore. To present all the serfs of this historical estate. With their freedom. Men. You are free! Fetch Count Struensee. Count Struensee. Please kneel. We, Caroline Mathilde. Queen of Denmark and Norway. Do hereby bestow on you. The Order of Mathilde. Which we ourselves have created this day. And which you shall be the first to receive. May God preserve you. I applaud your eccentricity my dear Count. But are you sure you are not being a little .. over generous? Quite sure, Your Majesty. Perhaps other of your subjects might care to follow my example. Perhaps. Naturally. I have nobody particular in mind. Naturally. - Nonetheless. I still believe that a peasant's grandson .. Though he might win the highest possible honour. And perform the greatest possible service. I admit it Your Majesty. He might do both those things. But a peasant's grandson I still believe could never become a gentleman. And I, Sir Murray, still believe he could. Unfortunately it is something we will not be able to prove. But if we could, I would be willing to wager my watch on it. Though I am a Scotsman. Can I see it? With pleasure .. Your Majesty. A very nice watch. You are risking a lot, Sir Murray. Well, we Scotsmen are like that. All the same. I will accept your wager. It is beside the point, My Lord. The problem about Count Struensee is what he may do in the future. Not what he's done in the past. - Exactly. And our immediate problem. Is to clip the claws before they have grown too long. That is by no means the whole problem. Heavens above. Hasn't he done enough damage already? What with his confounded property tax and the rest of it. He has but we can attend to that later. Well there is something rotten in the state of Denmark. He came here a nobody and look at him now. How has he done it? I think the new Count has powerful friends at Court. Well gentlemen, it is clear we must take action. And take action before it is too late. Unfortunately it is already too late. The council is in session, My Lord. Sittings are not open to the public. My apologies but I come on His Majesty's authority. I have in fact a message from His Majesty. Dissolving the council. - What? His Majesty has just signed the official order. His Majesty took the precaution. Of signing it in duplicate. Where is that confounded boy? Stand aside. I regret Your Majesty, my orders are to admit nobody. Sir? - Sorry Your Majesty. My orders. Who gave them? - Count Struensee, Your Majesty. The officer is mistaken. The orders were not mine. They were his Majesty's. Oh! Count Struensee. I suppose you wouldn't be willing to accept a little advice? Willing and anxious to, My Lord. Don't underestimate Her Majesty the Queen Mother. You are apt to lose your head. If you are not very careful .. Within the year you may lose it altogether. Perhaps My Lord, I prefer to keep my own head for one short year. Rather than preserve for thirty years a head that contained no mind of its own. Really my friend. Really. You do underrate your adversary. Did I see it? Tell me. Did I really see it? She can't go out on the streets like that. It will create a scandal. She can't go out in the street. My goodness, ladies. What is the matter? Have you an audience with the Queen? - Aye, I have. Then you will soon see what is the matter. His Excellency, Sir Murray Keith. Well Sir Murray, what is the trouble? Why, nothing. You are .. Nothing at all. You mean, you don't like them? Oh, I like them, aye. But that is hardly the point, is it. I mean, you are not going out in them, are you? Certainly I am. In a few moments I'm going out riding. Count Struensee suggested these. Aren't they nice. Skirts are such a nuisance riding. Aye. But .. Yes. But what I mean .. - You mean, you disapprove of them. I don't presume to say that, Your Majesty. I merely think .. They belong to the opposite sex. Well. If it comes to that. Your Majesty. I am sorry, Sir Murray. Now I really must go or I shall be late. Oh, it isn't four yet. Could Your Majesty spare me two minutes? I see you still have your time. Aye. I think it is fairly safe. The King may turn a peasant into a Count if he had a mind to. It will take more than the flourish of a pen to turn him into a gentleman. What do you want to see me about? A very grave matter, Your Majesty. As your fellow countryman it is my duty to inform you .. That there is a great deal of slanderous gossip concerning you. Indeed? - Aye. It may even become dangerous. Since Struensee abolished censorship it's possible to print anything. There are pamphlets .. Paragraphs, posters. Caricatures. I have one here. Why all the laughter, Your Majesty? Only something Sir Murray Keith said. You are hiding something from me. - Nothing very important. Let me see it. Keith brought it. Denmark is a small country but it has its full quota of malicious liars. It hasn't hurt me. It only made me laugh. I am sorry this should have happened to you. I'm not. I wish it were true. Alright Von Eyben. You may go now. I am tired. Goodnight. Very well, Your Majesty. Alright, Von Eyben. That can be done in the morning. Goodnight. Goodnight, Your Majesty. Come. Your Majesty. I'm not Her Majesty. Listen. You've got to go back. Yes. You've got to go back. If this were found out, do you know what it would mean? Very well. I knew that when I came in. Child. You want to lose your head? I don't think I mind. I'll go if you want me to. But you must give me a reason. What reason? You must say. And you must mean it. That you don't want me to stay. I'm afraid. I don't want you to stay. Look at me. Now say it. I'm sorry, but it's true. I don't want you to stay. Caroline. I'm lying to you. I'm not going to let you go. I want you so badly I don't care if they kill us both afterwards. I'm not going to lie like a gentleman but .. A gentleman be damned! I'm not the gentleman you deserve. The man which your love deserves. I'm in love with a person for the first time in my life. Let me pass. - Sorry, Your Majesty. My orders forbid you seeing His Majesty without permission of Count Struensee. Confound your orders, man. How dare you. Let me pass this instant! Or I will have you thrown out of the regiment in disgrace. Has everyone gone insane at this Court? You stand there and see the mother of your King insulted. I'm an old woman but I won't stand it. I won't stand it. I want to see my son now. Your Majesty. How is she? Just the same I'm afraid, Your Majesty. Is there any hope? - Perhaps a little. What a pity. Caroline, my darling. You have come. It isn't Caroline, Your Majesty. It is His Majesty the King. Oh. Her Majesty wishes to be left alone with her son. Christian, I must talk to you. - Yes, but .. - Listen to me. But aren't you ill? Aren't you dying? - No, I'm not. Heaven knows why I'm not. - But they told me .. Never mind what they told you. Things have come to a pretty pass when a woman has to die to see her own son. Fetch that slipper. - Slipper? - Yes. Have you ever seen that before? No. Supposing I were to tell you .. That that is Caroline's slipper. And that rug with the footprint on it .. Lies outside your dear Dr Struensee's door. What? Your Majesty. Have you heard news? Have you heard the news? Do you mean your mother, Your Majesty? - No. I don't mean her. I mean my wife. No, I haven't heard. Well, it may interest you to know that my wife has a lover. She has a lover. And do you know who it is of all people? It's Struensee. We've got the proof. Your Majesty, I can only express .. I regret deeply .. - Regret? Regret? Why it's the best news we've heard for years. But don't you see? This means the end of Struensee and all his moral lecturing. It means the end of this dull, dreary life. Don't you see that from now on I'm not in his power anymore. He's in mine. I didn't know you wanted such a thing. - Wanted it? Of course I wanted it. Pull yourself together, Brandt. Do you know what I am going to do tonight? I am going to celebrate this. With a party. A party? - Yes. On the old lines. On the old lines, Your Majesty? What will your mother say? What will my mother say? Why, she suggested it. Is anything disturbing Your Majesty? The party seems a little unbalanced. Unbalanced? Oh, the ladies? The ladies. Well, they won't be long. I had forgotten, my dear. How shy you are of the opposite sex. Well? I have a headache. - A headache? Oh. We'll soon make you forget all about that. How much is it? - 80 kroners, Your Lordship. How many men are there in the regiment? - Twelve hundred, Your Lordship. Hmm. That's 96 thousand kroners. This braid is very expensive. Aye, it is Your Lordship. His Majesty insisted on it. How much would it come to without it? - Well .. Half, Your Lordship. Very well. But His Majesty insisted. - We'll have it like that. His Majesty wishes to see you, My Lord. Aright. Without the braid. Your Majesty. - Ah. The very man I wanted. What is it, Your Majesty? It's a party. A little party. With your mother dying? My mother's pulse is two beats better tonight. That is why we are celebrating. I see. I'm afraid I am busy. I shall have to leave you. Oh no you don't. Oh no you don't. I can't have a party without my Prime Minister. You are going to sit with me and you're going to sit in the place of honour. You are going to sit .. Next to the Queen herself. Bring on the wine. Your Majesty. You don't know how happy I am. It's like old times. Now you are the real King of Denmark. Long may you reign over us. I wish all your subjects. Were as loyal as I. Take me away from all of this. What do you mean? I can't bear it a moment longer. Let's go away together. Together? To England. Anywhere. No. You were a county doctor. Now you are Prime Minister of Denmark. Isn't that enough for you? You've already achieved as any man could. Everything. - Not everything. We planned to do things for Denmark, you and I. But I think we won't be allowed to do much more. I'll go on until they stop me. Are fools like this worth working for? I don't mean them. I mean work for the people. Is their happiness more important to you than .. Anything else? Friedrich. Has it ever occurred to you .. That I too may want to be happy? I'm tired of all this. All this meanness and treachery. We can only trust each other. If we love each other. Let's take that before it's too late. Darling. Give all this up. Come away with me, please. Caroline. What else is there that matters? Perhaps nothing. Listening to you now it suddenly seems all .. Very unimportant. How can you allow this in the Queen's presence? I insist that it be stopped instantly! Insist? - Yes. Ha! How dare you insist. So the Queen is shocked, is she? The Queen considered my table before her lover. And is shocked. I congratulate her. You think I haven't been watching you all these months, don't you? But I have. You think I don't know what goes on in your mind, don't you. But I do! Your Majesty goes too far. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? More wine! Wine! [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshots! ] What is the meaning of this? - Your Majesty will come with us. Do you realize you've spoilt my party? What have I done? Nothing my dear. Nothing. - But .. You've done splendidly. Now just sign this for me. Well .. - Sign. If I do will you let me go back to my friends? Yes. - Alright. Struensee! Queen Caroline Mathilde and Count Struensee? What is this about Caroline and Struensee? A warrant for their arrest for treason. Arrest? Oh but .. But I don't want to arrest Struensee. I like him. Have you forgotten your wife? He made a fool of you, Christian. Nobody could make a fool of me. What about the scene you made just now? Scene? Oh that? That was only just to teach them a lesson. I don't mind what she does as long she lets me have my little parties. And I like the doctor. I brought him all the way from Hamburg. He has made everybody realize how wonderful I am. They say he's saved me thousands and I haven't had a single cold since he came. And you can't call that treason. Sign! Alright. Anything got get back to my friends. There, my friend. Now let's talk this Over like sensible men. A long life. Thank you. The same to you. You mustn't take me too literally of course. Now to business. What can I do for you? Save me a little trouble. - Trouble? The trouble and expense of a long-drawn-out trial. Oh my friend, I'll gladly save you the trouble of a trial altogether. I'm afraid My Lord that is beyond even your power. If you would do me the favour to sign .. - A confession? Exactly. You think I have designs on the throne? - And was Her Majesty's lover. I'm sorry, my friend. It would give me the greatest pleasure to do for you this little service but .. I am sorry. That is your final decision? I am afraid so. Just a moment, My Lord. I have a much better idea than that. - What's that? How would you like me to sign a paper admitting embezzlement? Embezzlement? - Exactly. You mean State funds? You have been taking State funds? For months and months. Thousands and thousands of kroner. There is one little condition. What? - Ah .. Her Majesty the Queen must be set at liberty before I sign anything. My Lord, that is not possible. I think you'll find it possible, My lord. Some little confusion among her guards? A little error somewhere? I think you will find it possible. I almost think I will. Cooperate with Sir Murray Keith on the matter .. And when Keith tells me the Queen is safely on her way to England .. I will sign. Thank you, My Lord. You may go off duty. I am sorry, Your Excellency. I have strict orders. Alright. Everything is ready for Her Majesty. The boat leaves in an hour. - I will tell Her Majesty. She's safe. Thank you, My Lord. What time does the .. Ceremony take place? We had thought of daybreak, with Your Lordship's permission. At daybreak? I shall not be late. She sent no word? - There was not time. You will see her no doubt soon in England. You will tell her that I .. Your Majesty. I'm sorry, Sir Murray. I tricked you. It wasn't I you sent off in the carriage. It was one of my ladies. You fool! Get out of here! Keith. Take her away. Sir Murray. Why did you come back? How dare you come back. I had to. I wanted to be with you. I had to be with you. You wanted to be with me? Well. I didn't want you. Do you see? You coming back will hang us both. It was I who got rid of you. It was I who arranged your escape. Are you still so thick-witted that you can't see through it all? Do you still believe I ever loved you? Don't you know even now I use you as I use everybody else? Don't you know that through you I might even have made myself King? Love you? It's no use, dear. You have tried this trick .. before. It's no trick. You must be out of your senses. Stop it, darling. We haven't got long. Let's not waste time saying things we don't mean. I've upset you by coming back, haven't I. But I couldn't go alone. Listen. I love you. 0f course I love you. I wanted you to go because .. I am selfish. Because it's easier to die if I know .. You are safe. I had wanted to be safe. I know you don't. I know it is harder For you than me but .. You've got to do it. You've got to do it do you hear, because .. It is the last thing I ask you. Will you do it? Don't cry, darling. You had better go. Go now, will you. Partings are horrible things. We'll keep ours short, shall we. You are going to try, for my sake .. To live happily. And usefully. Now don't cry, darling. Your smile is so pretty. Leave me a smile will you? [ Door knocks ] Come in. Escort from His Majesty's ship Southampton. Come, Your Majesty. I shall not leave Denmark until .. Until daybreak. I am ready. Your Majesty. - T-g -
