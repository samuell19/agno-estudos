Alice Cooper, The Nightmare. Special guest star, Vincent Price. You'll have to excuse me, but I'm laughing at you, little boy. I am laughing because... You're lost. I'm not lost, I'm sleeping. No, little boy. This is no longer simple sleep. This is much, much more... This is the big one, the ultimate phantasm. The extravaganza! This is a nightmare. You are at my mercy, little boy, because you created me. I am the spirit of the nightmare. Oh, yeah. Nightmares aren't from indigestion or tension or discomfort. They come from the blackness of your mind. This is all a part of your imagination. And little boy, I'm so thrilled that you have been blessed with such a fertile imagination. It's really nothing. Yes, and it makes my job so much easier. Now, what would you like first? Well, I think if we started with a little... Whoa, whoa, hold it, hold it. This is my nightmare, right? Yes, that's correct. No holds barred, all stops pulled. - A four-star nightmare! - OK, let's go. I appreciate your enthusiasm, little boy. You want excitement and that's what you'll get, but first we must make a bargain. Oh, no. No, no. No bargains. No. Come now. It won't hurt, I promise. You're not selling your soul to the devil, no. You're just renting it out. Now all you have to do is to agree never to try to escape. Escape? Why? It's my nightmare. Good. I'm glad we're on the same side. "Escape." What a glorious word. It always conjures up great visions of danger whenever I hear it. All right, little boy. If it's excitement you're after, I'll show you some. I'll show you the tormenting way to incredible pleasure. But always remember, there is no escape. That's right, little boy. Sleep. And may you have a wonderfully dreadful dream and a deliciously total feeling of helplessness. Fine... Fine. You're catching on. I have so many horrible things in store for you. You won't be able to thank me enough. I see you've come here for an education. That's very encouraging. Most children aren't interested in science. Well, this is my museum. I want to show you my wonderful spider collection. I don't like spiders, I don't like witches and I don't like you at all. Little boy... - Remember our bargain. - Yeah. Spiders are such endearing little creatures, very much like you. But before I show you my most renowned prizes, do tell me, are you pleased with your excursion so far? I mean, you're not afraid, are you? Well, why? Why? There's been nothing frightening yet. It's all been so tame so far. You don't want to wake up, do you? - Well, I wouldn't mind. - Well, you can't wake up. Well, now we'll take you on the tour. Welcome to the Museum of Natural Horrors. Now, moving right along here... Eugh! Now, please, young man, don't touch the displays. Oh, that's very cute. Here we have Arachnida, the spiders, our finest collection. This friendly little devil is the Heptothilidi, unfortunately harmless. Now over here, over here, the nasty Lycosa raptoria. His tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of the skin. Yes, and here, here is my prize. My prize, the Black Widow. Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. Her kiss is fifteen times as poisonous as that of the rattlesnake. You see, her venom is highly neurotoxic. Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system, causing intense pain, profuse sweating, difficulty in breathing, loss of consciousness, violent convulsions, and finally... death. You know, I think what I love most about her is her innate, her inborn need to dominate, to possess. In fact, immediately after the consummation of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the species, she kills and eats him. She is delicious. And I hope he was. Oh, such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment. If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy, I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling, demented child-king long enough. And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor! These words he speaks are true, we're all humanary stew if we don't pledge allegiance to the Black Widow. Fine, you're catching on. I have so many horrible things in store for you. You won't be able to thank me enough. What's the matter, little boy? You look so sad. Didn't you like playing with your toys? Yeah, I guess I just got a little carried away. You reminded me of when I was a youth, many hundred years ago. But that's another nightmare. Well, no harm. You're here to have a good time. And you must admit this nightmare is everything you wanted it to be now, isn't it, eh? I haven't let you down, have I? By Jove, he's got it. I really think he's got it. Or we've got him. Either way, he's such a splendid dreamer. He's coming along nicely. Wonderfully demented, thoroughly diabolical. Such a worthy selection. He fits in so perfectly. And more to come, little boy. OK. Little boy, there's no need to run. You'll never find an escape. I've already told you that. I've had enough. I'm getting out of here. No, you can't do that. You'll miss the best part. I've saved it for the last. This is what you wanted once you closed your eyes, isn't it? We haven't let you down now, have we? And you've been so much help because this entire nightmare was waiting patiently just inside your subconscious. Foolish little boy. He had to learn that we weren't finished with him yet. Bedrooms are only temporary sanctuaries from nightmares. Sweet dreams.
