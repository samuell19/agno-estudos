I'm so disappointed. - No, I'm not going in. - Yes you are. - You little shit! - Roger, please! You're gonna really cop it! - You see?! - What a fucking pair! - You nervous? - You could say that. At the end of the exam you said you felt confident. You can never tell with those markers. Come on. In any case Dad, if I didn't get it, what difference would it make? Diploma or no diploma, I'll still be unemployed. Come on. It's over and done. Your notification. Thank you. I.D. Thank you. Sonquin, Julien. Sonquin, Julien. Sonquin, Julien. Failed. See... at least he passed! I'd be surprised. I know him. Okay then, you go to the final year. You'll sign up for my cramming class and we'll do next year's together. Here we have my cramming class, the Louis XIV academy. New enrollments are nothing to worry about. You have to admit that our results this year... Nobody knows. Subject to rectification, that's always possible. And now, some news about the Baccalaureate results. The average is 59 percent, across the country. The Saint-Louis de Gonzague school, in the 16th District, was the leading establishment with a 95 percent pass rate. At the other end of the spectrum we have the Louis XIV academy at Versailles, with a zero pass rate. That's right, a zero pass rate. You'd have to bet that for the latter, the situation can only improve. Our next bulletin at 8pm. Thank you for listening. Where's Léon? Léon! Léon! Léon! For the last 20 years I've gone along with everything you did. I let you act as you please. Today we see the results of your permissive methodology. A 100 percent failure rate. Are you listening, Léon? 100 percent! You realise what this does to us... this free TV publicity. "68 percent of parents call for a repressive education system "for their children." Will you listen to me when I'm speaking to you? "Repressive!" That's what it says here! So we'll give them "repression"! They'll get what they pay for. - Understand, Léon? - Yes. T H E R E T A R D S Look at them... Having fun... skating around. Make hay while the sun shines. DEATH TO MONEY Shit! My bike! We don't know them and I already hate them. Yes, I hate them! We're from different worlds. We've got class. They're just upstarts. Right, Léon? Upstarts. It's all about money. And without money... ...we'll have to sell this place. Never! I'll never be parted from this family home. Never. Are you listening, Léon? They'll get their baccalaureate, the little monsters. With whatever force required. Even you, Baptiste Lavalle, our best "client". You'll get your Bac... Hi, girls! Ah, we don't just have fatties this year! Anything you want to know, just ask me. - I've been here for 4 years. - What about me? - Hi, Julien! How are things, pal? - Okay. This is Julien, our medical certificate provider. Delighted to meet you all. Just as well you brought a cooking pot. I'll be eating out of it before Christmas. - Wanna bet? - Sure! Hey, cutie... You know this'll be the best school year you ever had? You know it, don't you, eh? It's not open yet! You in such a hurry to work? You want to get your Bac, you can't waste a moment. Is that your car? Sure, it's mine. Well, not exactly mine, it's my dad's. Got to impress the chicks on the first day, understand? No rush! Women and children first. Girls and boys, I'm on a mission to get you your Bac diplomas. Some might say "Mission impossible." I'm accepting the challenge, and I'll win. You'll leave my establishment equipped with your Baccalaureate. When you'll meet the gym teacher, you'll see why I've been here 4 years. It's Marilyn. Apart from me your teachers will be Mr Jumaucourt... ...for maths... science, physics, chemistry and English. History and geography will be taught by Miss Jumaucourt. Are we done? - Physical education... - And sex... ...by Mr Bruce. That's Marilyn? Marilyn hasn't shaved. - You read the new rules? - No, just the new school fees. Locker room! - Locker room! - Not OK? Keep me a place. Young lady... dress or skirt. They're Saint-Laurent, Rive Gauche. Whatever. On the right. What's this, Miss? Animals aren't allowed here. This is my dog. His name's Cuddles. We'll tie up Cuddles here. You can get him afterwards. Mummy's going to work, but she'll be back for you. Get along now, Miss. Lie down, Cuddles! Who placed the students? Not me. They seated themselves. So I see. - Go to the back. - Me? Why? I said so. Otherwise the door is open. Your term's paid for anyway. Hurry up. You too. You! Move it! I'm fixing what you've been failing to do for 20 years... Get in control from the start. So I was enjoying my morning ice-cream, and turn around... There's some bastard pinching my moped. Did you see the guy? Yeah, but a long way off, from behind. So, what are you gonna do? Gotta buy another one. No way I'm walking. "It's a story full of sound and fury..." "A story full of sound and fury..." "O wretched people..." "usurped by a tyrant with the bloody sceptre..." "when will you again have a day to celebrate?" Nice to meet you. - English doesn't interest you? - So-so. Isn't it a language that's widely-spoken enough for you? No point in learning any foreign languages. - French is enough for you? - There are machines to translate. So why should I bust my balls? Nice to meet you. And soon, I won't have to type anymore. I'll just speak, and it'll translate it. So why bust my balls? How much do you want to spend on your moped? 5 or 6 hundred, no more. I might have one around that price. Really? I'll take a look. Okay. Come out! Come out or I'll open! I have a key, you know! It's strictly forbidden to smoke in the toilets. I know you're there. I know who it is. The smoke doesn’t bother you?? You'll have to change your habits. Go to class! I shall get them under control! I shall! Where's the toilet? Door on the left. There's a sign. Cuddles! Cuddles...! Mummy's coming! My Cuddles? It's eaten Cuddles! Police! Police! Police! It gobbled up my dog! It gobbled up my Cuddles! But that's my car! Of course. I don't have a car. If everyone was like me, there'd be no cars. But it's not in anyone's way! It's no bother to anyone! - It didn't bother anyone! - Everyone says that. 10 million cars are no bother. This is what happens now. It was no bother! Now it's wrecked. Yes, it won't be a bother anymore. At it again! Come out! I know you're there. You know it's forbidden to smoke in the toilets. Come on out! I'll give him what for! Why not, though? When I say "no" it doesn't mean "no way!" - So it's "yes"? - It's not "yes". It depends where. Fine!... Listen... At my parents, my room is at the end of the corridor. No, that's not risky enough. That's no fun. - So it's "no"? - It'll always be "no"... Unless it was during class. How, during class? With the pipette, we drop some catalyst on these crystals. And get smoke. If there's smoke, there's a reaction. Your turn now. I'll sell you my moped for 700. - 700? - Yep. - More than my maximum. - Quiet please! Do you think she's watching us? She must have installed some contraption. Are we still on track about what we discussed? For sure. Okay, don't move. Hey, you there...!! Are you crazy? I said "some drops"! You're mad! Should we open the door? No! Out of the question! My flowers are outside. I'll continue. C, L... 2 H, C less C, H, C 2, gives us... ...ethylene dichloride. I hope you've paid attention. As I was saying... All go well? Not bad, Daddy. This is it. Not bad looking at all. It's a good one. I'd say, apart from the colour, it's identical. Of course. This brand's mass-produced. - Yeah? - Yep. I'll give you the cash tomorrow, OK? So you'll get the bike tomorrow. "Business is business." Dressed up like that will get you in trouble for sure. Mind your own business. How's the one who's gonna end up in my bed? Tell me... Can't you find him a girlfriend? He's starting to annoy me. 500, 600, 700. And as a bonus... a great chain with a key. So you won't get it pinched anymore. What's with that? Locker. There you are. - Respectable. - Your tie? - Oh, my tie... wait... Wait, wait. Can I go now? No, young lady! Pants are not allowed. From 1921 to 1929... ...the United states enjoyed a period of prosperity... ...unprecedented in history. Industrial expansion was enormous. Standardisation allowed for mass-production at lower prices. The list of achievements was amazing in every department. The USA represents less than 7 per cent of surface of globe. Only 6 percent of the world's population... ...but over 70 percent of the cars in circulation... Up there. ...are driving on American roads. It consumes a third of global energy. It produces a quarter of the world's steel, more than a third of the aluminum, and almost half of the manufactured items that the world uses. Coal... 300 million tons. Corn... 82 million tons. Block this up. In 1970... coal production... 550 million tons. Iron... 100 million tons. Agricultural production... Wheat... 22 million tons. Corn... 31 million tons. Barley... 4,5. Oats... 9 million tons. Wheat price trends in Chicago. I was looking for a book on top of the cupboard... Julien, my fiance. - Hi. - G'day. Her future ex-fiance. This is Bébel, the horny guy I told you about, Ruth. - Ruth? - Ruth. Ruth! Don't change a thing. I'll play you a game... ...and the winner gets to hump the girl of his choice. Ruth? Oh, shit! It's OK, don't worry about it. Go on. Carry on... don't worry. Pretend I'm not here. It's not their fault, Boss. They didn't do it on purpose. Of course, you're right. It's my fault. Everything's my fault! They are always right! They are young and I'm not! It's essential that youth has its way... ...and accordingly I must step aside! That's my role in life, so go right ahead! I've only the right to silence. If I complain, let me have it! So trample on me... Go ahead! For 4 years now, you've been driving me crazy! Failing your Bac every year... ...just to stop me having a meal! I think you want me to relocate down to Ardeche... That I snap completely! But I'm not going to snap. I shall stay here, and I shall eat my dinner. I'll eat my carrots like I do every day. Do you live with your parents? No, they're very separate. My mother lives in Canada and my father in Australia. They pay for my pad in this old lady's place. It's really cool. - Don't make any noise. - No, no. Get undressed! Quick! Hurry up... Get your gear off! Here I come! Oh, Ruth! Oh, Ruth! No, Ruth! No, that's the old lady's bedroom! Oh shit! The old lady! - Where to now? - I know a great hotel. Here we are. Off you get. You said it was a hotel. Sort of hotel. I squat in the attic so as to be handy in the morning. If you'd follow me please, Madam. - I can't go in there! - Anything's possible for love. Follow me. Come on, hurry up! Come on, climb up. Come on! Fuck it!... Careful... mind your head. Be quiet! The head sleeps right below us. Don't make a sound. I'm set up here. I sleep here during recess. I think I'll move in here permanently. Watch out! Cool, eh? No, no... I'm tired. And we've got school tomorrow. No! Just keep to yourself. Oh, damn! Damn! I slept in. So as not to be late... I thought it best to come like this. Besides, you have some great uniforms. - No, go to class! - But... No "buts". You're late. Hurry up. "To vector subspaces from the same space..." Would you go to your seat please, Miss. Come on, don't disturb the class. As I was saying... "from the same space..." What are you doing there? "To vector subspaces... "E and E' and E are supplementary." Why are you crying, pet? I'm going to be late for work. For what work? I start my cashier shift at 9, at Codec's. Codec's? "Adults can be put in several categories... "idiocy... when the level of testing is under 3 years." Someone snatched my wheels once again, yesterday. Shit! So, what now? I'll have to buy another one, but the insurers won't like it. - I can sell you mine. - What about you? I'll borrow my cousin’s. Yeah, but I really like the colour. If you like, I'll paint it for you at no extra cost. That's cool... Fine! For that family, it's no big deal. But when it comes down to it, it's a pretty penny for us. Wait, don't hang up! Yes, on white paper. Stop! That's enough! Come on... this isn't funny! I don't see the joke at all! All right... all right! Time for recess, so you can go. Sir, we'd like to use recess to do some revision. - Sorry... To do what? - Some revision. You want revision? Does everyone want revision? Yes we do. Well, go ahead and revise. I'm going to go have a bite to eat. They preferred to stay in class to do revision. - Oh, really? - Oh yes! Well, you see... discipline works. That's for sure. You ready? All set. It's perfect, go ahead. You see, Léon. They're under control. They'll get their Bac for me. I'm telling you Léon, they'll get me their Bac. 8, not very good. You could try harder. 2. Zero, as always. Don't change a thing. Oh, I'm sorry! Really! How stupid of you! Anyway... ...that skirt doesn't really suit you. This is a skirt from Dames de France, that suits me very well. I prefer you in your white dress with the blue flowers and the small collar. Sets off your figure nicely. - You really think so? - Yes, yes. That's quite enough! I'll go and change. - There you go... that's better! - Quiet! So, the American automotive industry. The American and European leaders in the automotive industry. On one hand... "Is the inequality of men an obstacle to their equality as citizens?" First, you start by noting the man-citizen dichotomy. What are they up to? North East, coal... North East, coal... the south east, rich in oil... In the west, hydroelectricity. Ohio lies between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes. Its north east a veritable industrial centre. We were up to the citizen-man dichotomy, right? "Which could be natural or from birth. Its importance..." Hey guys! She's at it again! Here she comes! No, I have work to do, lot of work! I have work to do! If only her mother could see her! ...worldwide. Those monsters! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! For everybody... 10 minutes of P.E. For you too! You like him? Want me to fix you up with him? There... Don't move, and I'll send him to you. - Julien, come here. - What? Can you do me a favour? I left my chemistry book up in the attic room. - Could you get it for me? - What for? It's not a trick... I just don't want to run into the head. - If you don't want to, forget it. - No, I'll go. You're a champ! But... What are you doing there? Hey, Caro... Can you do me a favour? Depends. I've left my chemistry book up in the attic. Could you get it? I don't want the head to know I'm camped in her attic. Would you do it? It'd be a big favour. Alright. Caro, you're a doll! Would you tell Julien that I'll be right back? Yes, of course I will. It's not that I don't want you. That's not the problem. But if you really think about it... ...you realize that it always ends up the same. And if there are no feelings, we can't treat it as something pure. I'm with Caroline. Is it something pure with her? With her, it's sublime. It's never the same. But with me, it could be even better. But I'm with Caroline. She needn't know about it. No. Where's Bébel's book? - Right here. - Give it to me. - Come get it. - Give it to me now! Oh, shit! Listen Caroline, I can explain... Another one of Bébel's tricks! That's right. I think we'll have a bit of fun with him. What's wrong? What a bastard! - Do you know what Julien was doing? - No. Screwing Jeanne, in the attic. What a bastard! The bastard! What are you going to do? Get my revenge! If I were you I'd do the same. - I'll screw the first guy I see. - Great! Who? Eco, MC2... You know what pisses a guy off more than anything? It's when his chick fucks his best friend. - You sure? - The surveys are very accurate. - His best friend? - That's right. And I'm not telling you this because I'm his best friend. No, I realise that. What are you doing tonight? - Tonight I have a date. - Alright... No, wait... I can break it. Thank you. No problem, if that will make you happy. - Get undressed! - Yeah! You don't have the light on? No, because of my parents. It's a guy! Very good in the home stretch! Much better performance than usual! Please go ahead... don't mind us. I don't want any more, anyway. I tell you, I don't want any more! You stay there! I've something to tell you. Take a seat. I'm pregnant. Whose is it? You all. You sure? Look. It's not me. Gotta throw this thing away! It's not happening in there. Your father's a doctor. Maybe he could arrange something. I'm keeping it. Is "the state for freedom" an obstacle or a condition? "Is the authority of the state compatible with liberty? "For Rousseau, the function of government... "to assure freedom. "For Freud... justice, restriction of freedom.” For Mr Gaétan... 10 minutes of gymnastics. Why, Ma'am? I'm sorry, I don't want overcrowded classrooms. The teachers have better control over their students if the classes are less crowded. I understand you, Madam. But I can still take another student. What section? B as in Baptiste, Madam. A good student? I don't know, but... a hard worker. That's rare these days. He really wants his Baccalaureate. He'll work hard for that. A good recruit. The term is payable in advance. "Moments of inertia in some homogeneous solids... "with respect to an axis of symmetry..." I'd like to introduce a new student who'll finish the year with you. Come in. Quiet! Quiet! Go to the back. Sit here. Gentlemen, Miss... What's your name? Student Gaston Pourquier. - There you are! - Thanks. Can you do the exact same in balsa wood? Yeah. I smell trouble! At the end of the year you know you have to get your Bac. Okay, try to go under. The big boy's gonna be really pissed off. In 1919, after World War I, Paul Valéry said... "We know now that our civilizations..." A night of love, if I destroy The Monster. Is it a bet? What do you risk? Having a terrible night. Sorry, am I disturbing you? A bit, actually. You'd like a little exercise? That'd be great. It's very relaxing. Very well. Bruce! What's so funny? Can we get some work done? Back to work, Ma'am! That's what I pay good money for, isn't it? What is it? Great stuff. - What is it? - You go play with the kids. But what is it? Coke. Can I try it? Got any dough? Give him 10. Here you are. Shake it as hard as possible. That'll do. What an idiot! You've OD'd! Long waves... 3 kilometres. Medium waves... 800 metres. Short waves... 100 metres. That's the 3rd time you dropped your steel ruler! Sorry, Sir. X-rays are very weak... 200 angstroms. What? Would you repeat your question? Help me please. I'd like you to speak louder? What happened? Would you speak louder? What's he saying? Do you speak French? Speak louder! Not normal... This is not normal... Who? Who put this up? It's not possible. It's not possible! It's not possible! It's not possible! Except for Pourquier, not one would have had his Bac! Not one! The best had a 6 out of 20 average! They'll get their Bacs, whatever it takes! It's not possible. They're just dunces! Children, what can I say? You're on the right path. Carry on! Yes, you're on the right track. If the preliminary test you just took, was the official Bac test in June... ...you'd all have your Bacs. I'm happy you've become aware of the importance of the Bac in your future. The Bac, an old dream... which is going to become a reality. As for me, I don't see how I could get it. By working, you see. If you could get it just by working, people would know... Believe me, it's well-known. The only way I'd ever get my Bac would be to remove the tests or draw random lots. That's true, it'd be much fairer to everyone, with a lottery system. High income family or low... Same for everyone from the start. Absolutely, and later in life, same thing. Everyone works, and at the end of the month you get paid. For the same job, 10 grand, or else the minimum wage. I'd like to see that. The Bac's useless. There'll be an atomic war, Bac or no Bac. I want it to explode before I have kids. Yeah. A super atomic war, really aesthetic... Coppola style, with blue, green, red mushroom clouds... with Wagner music in the background. That'll be great. It would get rid of 30 years of stupidity. I personally think that they are very pessimistic. I want to get my Bac, because later I want to get married... Then I'll want kids who'll get their Bac... ...and who'll get married. That's very nicely said. You think so? Well, I would marry a guy who has his Bac and is filthy rich. My future is all set out. Bac or no Bac, I'll be a minister at the very least. And Mr Pourquier, what will your future be? Oh, I don't want my Bac for my future. Come on now, you're the youngest here, by far. Besides, your results are more than adequate. Just one detail... the Belgian Congo no longer exists. And French Equatorial Africa either. Quiet! And the Czar of Russia isn't Nicholas IV, but Brezhnev. But Madam, I swear that's what it said in my books! You'll have to get more up-to-date editions. Given these excellent results, I decided for all of us to spend the day in the country. ♪ We are all an idle lot ♪ We don't care about tomorrow ♪ We're not crazy about hard work ♪ We're more the lethargic type of guy ♪ We've chosen a life of fun ♪ We want someone else to row ♪ To live happily, let's live in bed ♪ You see, we got it all ♪ Why do today, why do today ♪ what can surely be done tomorrow? ♪ Why do today, why do today ♪ what can surely be done tomorrow? ♪ Our vision's got somewhat blurred ♪ And tenderness in the guitar ♪ We no longer believe in herbal teas ♪ We pick the roses before they wilt ♪ We chose to have fun ♪ Bye bye, square roots ♪ We, what we like is to have tea ♪ You see, we got it all ♪ Remember your 20 years ♪ Yes oh yes, it was a good time ♪ We'd also like that on our tour ♪ We can always speak of love. With it, they'll get me that Bac. This is against my principles. Your principles! Like Montaigne, I prefer a head well-made than just full. How are things, kids? Great. - You enjoyed yesterday's trip? - Excellent. I'm going to introduce you to a new teacher. A new teacher? Yes, to prepare you for the exam. - A good teacher? - Superb. You'll see. Come on. Where's the teacher? What's this? Miss? Here... The learning machine. It comes from America. So, who wants to start? The first of these gentlemen... See you later. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down! Careful. A sentence will scroll on the screen. Repeat it. ONU, Organization of the United Nations founded in 1942. Attention... Repeat. You still don't want to repeat? Yes. The ONU was founded in 1942. In what year? In 1942. Faster! The ONU was founded in 1942. Repeat 42 several times. 42, 42, 42. New question. Choose the right answer. New York. Wrong answer. Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico in 1940. Repeat. Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico in 1940. Faster. Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico in 1940. In what year? In '40! Who? Kennedy. No, Trotsky. Where? In Dallas. Who? Debré. No, Kennedy. Trotsky was assassinated in 1940 at the Olympic Games in Mexico. Attention. New question. The Spanish Civil War commenced in 1936. Repeat. The Spanish Civil War commenced in 1936. In what year? In 1936. What? The Spanish Civil War . In what year? 36. What? The Spanish Civil War. In what year? 36. Finished in 36? No, commenced in 36. Bravo, you've earned yourself a little treat. Thank you, Ma'am. Choose the right answer. Wrong answer. The Matignon Pact was signed in 36. In what year? 1936. What? Matignon High School. My glasses! It can't go on like this. We must do something. This is your cramming class! - Shut the fuck up! - Don't talk to me like that! What's got into you? You're nuts! You realise how nasty that sounded? Listen, I'm really sorry. Me too. Tomorrow, we'll take the day off. For sure. Bruce! Take him to the kitchen, and take care of him. Hello, police? A bomb will go off at 10.30... - ...at the Louis XIV School. - Who's calling? This is C.R.A.S. Committee for Revolution at Secondary Schools. That's perfect. Thank you. I feel much better. Your turn. What about my baby? Later. You'll thank me. Bomb alert! Quick, quick, evacuate! Léon! It's going to explode! Don't worry... It's a joke. It's a false alarm! No, it's going to explode! It's going to explode! Good God... Léon! You're OK? A bomb's going to explode. - What? - A bomb's going to explode! Should have exploded... The time has passed now. I'm afraid it was a false alarm... ...given by schoolboys who wanted a day off. But... because you never can tell, we'll search the premises. - Hurry up! - They want to search the place? Little bastards... I'll show you who's boss! Can you imagine your life with me, instead of Pretty-Boy here? I want strawberries. I want strawberries. Marthe, a strawberry, quickly! What happened earlier at school?? A bomb alert. - A bomb alert? - The police got an anonymous call. Please repeat. Proper accent. That's better. Give me the right answer. I don't care! I don't care! I don't care! I don't care! I don't care! I don't care! New York. Wrong answer. Washington. Right answer. Hello, at 3pm, a bomb will go off at the Louis XIV School. So, they think it's just a joke? We'll just have to plant a real one. But a small one. A very small bomb. We'll hide it in a couscous-maker. A little bang! Maybe then they'll take us seriously. It's all written down. Just need to buy it. Yeah... here... Off you go, Mummy... Off you go! DO-IT-YOURSELF SALE I'll set it for noon. 12 o'clock sharp! You sure you didn't put in too much powder? No risk. There's less than in a July 14 firecracker. Racist! Racist machine! Enjoy it while you still can, Madame Machine! Marthe! You left a couscous-maker under the stairs. Thanks! Won't be more of an explosion that a firecracker? Sure! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! - Aren't you in class? - Yes, but I don't feel well. I've got a tummy ache. - Mint tea? - Good idea. The timer is set for 12.30. Great idea about the couscous steamer! Revolution gives birth to ideas! Our people will conquer! Our people will conquer! This tastes good. I'm going to the toilet. We need to reset the timer... so we get more time to alert the cops. OK! Otherwise all good. The official lunch is at exactly 12.30. I know. You have to be in the kitchen before 12. EMBASSY OF ABOU YAMEN Fuck! It's not our bomb! No more bomb? - Yes, there is one, but it's not ours! - You're on the wrong weed. There's a fucking bomb! Yes, we put it there. Listen to me, I'm not fooling around! There's a bomb, and it's huge! Everything's gonna blow! We have to get the hell out! There's a bomb! Hide! Officer! There's a bomb. There's a bomb. - Inspector, there's a bomb! - Again? - We planted it. - It's going to do a lot of damage! - It's not a joke. - There really is a bomb. Ours was going to blow at 12. We don't know when this one will. So there are bombs? - You want your afternoon off? - Oh no! There's no class this afternoon. So why this bomb alert? Because there really is a bomb. There really is a bomb! Do you know what a bomb does? Yeah, it goes boom. I've seen lots of them. Do you know what it'll cost you, to let a bomb explode? Do you know what it costs to offend a police officer? - There'll be lots of dead people. - You're pissing me off too? No assistance to someone in danger. What proof do you have that there's a bomb? If there was no bomb, I'd have called you anonymously. I wouldn't tell you to your face. Think about it for 2 seconds. My dear friends, you are very curious. But I'll tell you everything. Couscous is made with rolled semolina. Steam cooked. We add butter and the broth is strained off. Let me show you. Wonderful, fantastic! Our people will conquer! A bomb just exploded! Where? The Abou Yamen embassy. Under the stairs, in the kitchen. I've found it, Chief! Mummy? Mummy? Mummy! Lucie! Lucie, what's happening? Can you hear me? I don't believe it! My God! I'm in for it now! They'll give me hell! The bomb idea was ours, Your Honour. But not the one that exploded. They are a nuisance to society. They must be destroyed... before they destroy me! I had no idea about this bomb story Your Honour. So what were you doing there? He's listed as an anarchist. On the May Day parade, 1936. That's him! It wasn't just me! They are terrorists! I know the case as well as you do. I'm convinced, Madame. That you were shaken by the explosion... ...I can well believe. But don't make this a personal matter. Besides, the bomb maker... ...Mustapha Zamid, is in jail. As for you retards... 6 months minimum. Minimum! But we aren't retards. - Prove it. - How? By getting your baccalaureate. Otherwise? 6 months, 1 year, 3 years... Whatever's deemed appropriate. This matter is put under deferment. The final judgment will await the baccalaureate results. Now you have to get your Bac. Impossible. We've wasted all this year. Even if we swotted all day and night we couldn't do it. I don't want a scandal. You’ll get your Bac! The judge said "prison or your Bac". It'll be the Bac. I can't afford any scandals in my position. - But... - No scandal! Understood? It's a scandal! A scandal! I lock them up... They release them! That judge is a Commie! I'm sure she's a Commie! - The judge's office wants you to know... - What? ...that you can be the official monitor for the exams... ...of your hoodlums. Well, they'll never get their Bac! Because they won't get a chance to cheat! I don't want my baby to be born in jail. We'll bring you oranges and baby bottles. Don't worry... According to your latest checkup, your child will be born during the exam. That doesn't help. On the contrary, it may help us. The right sole is history. The left is geography. Guarantied! I passed Admin School with that. One side's higher than the other. I don't write them. Not my fault there's more history than geography. Plug in your receiver. There... It's connected. It's working. It works! 2A minus 2A equals... ...equals... (a + b) multiplied by (a - b). (a + b) multiplied by... Hold it, guys. So, Columbo, all's well? All is very well. Feels pretty good. Tomorrow, Bac time. In 10 days, clink time! It's all up for you lot. A coffee... strong. When you work hard all year, there are no surprises. Yes, I'm sure that's true. Thanks. My best wishes! What have you got in your hand? Nothing, Sir. Show them to me. Turn them. Quickly, quickly! Thank you! If, Kipling... You understand? It's always the same topics... I used to know this by heart. "If you can keep your head, when all about you...” He was feeling for something. Search! He's tickling him! Search! Left... left! Getting colder! Back to your seat! If I can... Sorry... very sorry... I didn't mean to, really! Excuse me, it's... Follow me! Come along, you're under arrest! Help! Help! This is it. Let's go! Something wrong? I'm going into labour. - Right now? - Yes. What's going on here? She's going into labour. It's coming out?! Call Emergency! I want to give birth here! You can't... there are no facilities! I want my Bac. You're worried about your Bac, now? Call Emergency! She's giving birth! She's giving birth! We have to hurry! Just relax now... Let's get her out of here! Too late! Look! It's starting. Take deep breath. Hold it and push! "If you can destroy your life's work..." "And without saying a word, rebuild it..." Hold on! A deep breath... Breathe in, hold it, push! “If you can be a lover, without being a fool in love...” Push hard! "If you can be strong, without ever being weak...” "If you can remain worthy while being popular...” - What are you talking about? - Advice to the baby. - It'll refuse to come out. - I can see it, I can see its head! "If you can keep your courage, and your head..." "There it is... there's the head!" "You'll be a man, my son!" - It's a girl. - Are you sure? - No touching! - Just looking. - I think she looks like you. - Very cute. She'll be a ball-breaker, the bitch! Oral exam, how's that shaping up? My dad is on it. Everything's in there. What's that? This? It's glucose. Glucose? Open it! It's sugar. For hypoglycemia, when I work too hard with my head. Careful... we have to keep an eye on him. Brazil's population in 1978. Brazil... So, Brazil... Brazil... 109 million. Mm? Yes. And... in 1930? 40 million approximately. 40 million. Correct. Now... be careful. In 1900? 17 million. West German cast iron production in 1970? So... cast iron in West Germany. Yes. 2 million? Tons of course. And in 1974? 2.2 million. In 1976? 2.4 million. - Bravo! - Thank you. Bravo! There we are. Fine. This is right for you. So, listen carefully... So, here, a little microphone. The questions are sent to base. From base, the answer comes back to this little speaker, Move your lips accordingly, as the answer comes through. Oxydisation reduction. Give an example. Can you repeat the question louder? Some examples of oxydisation reduction. Examples? Zn+ 2H30 gives ZN2 + 2H20 + H2 + calorific energy. Z3 + Z2 therefore equal electrical energy. + Z makes 2... Completed. It's the stress... Hurry up, it'll be your turn. Well you don't need the speaker. Hello. Choose one. This one. "Do we get closer to others... when we laugh?" "Do we get closer to others when we laugh?" "Do we get closer to others when we laugh?" "Do we get closer to others when we laugh?" Excellent pick... Let’s go. That's it... Read it to me. "Nietzsche...” Nietzsche... Through the laughter of Zarathustra... ...shows the possibilities of new life. "He who knows no laughter..." "...must not read me." From "Thus Spake Zarathustra.” "On the other hand, Plato..." On the other hand, Plato... ...at the beginning of "Metaphysics"... ...closes the door on laughter. No, besides, without a certain irony... Would you like to tell me the 3 heads of state who signed the Yalta Agreement in 1945? I'm sorry, she's all wet. I'll have to change her. Please go ahead. Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill. Very good, Miss. Miss Dutreix, Jeanne... Passed. Graded fair. Miss Janin, Caroline... Passed. Graded fair. Mr Laval, Baptiste... Passed. Graded fair. This is a parody of justice! Choose your words carefully, Inspector. Oh, that I do! Would the clerk take note. You'll hear about this! Your Honour... What about me? I failed, didn't I? Your name, Sir? Gaston Pourquier. Even if it's bad news, you have to tell me. Your card got stuck... Stuck as a failure... I might have known. No, Sir, it's your card that was stuck. You passed. Graded very good. Congratulations. Me? I passed?! "Very good"?! 10 YEARS LATER Caroline, these 8 pregnancies have fully developed you. Truly! Tell me Baptiste, you're still an actor? No, I got recycled. Acting is very difficult. You can't cheat. I edit a cinema magazine which talks about actors. It's easier. Thank you... Here's to you, Minister. I'm president! You've had 7 girls? I would have made you a boy the 1st time 'round. Are you still a GP? No, specialist. - Exams? Not too hard? - No problem at all. And I opened a dating-service club. Sorry I'm late... I stop to buy some smokes... ...and some bastard just stole my car. - Did you see the guy? - Yeah, but from behind, as he left. - How's your daughter? - She's wonderful. She should be here any minute now. Here she is! Hello Daddies! You'd never guess who's controlling the traffic right now. Who? - Yes! - No! Stop! He doesn’t have his Bac. He's poor, but I love him. What are you doing about your car? I'll just have to buy another one. You know I'm car dealer now? - You sell cars? - Sure do! Unused cars, any colour you want. Look who I've found for you! Champagne for the Inspector! We seem to know each other. Of course we know each other! Looks like you're not doing badly. You're important people. Chief Inspector of the Fraud Dept. And we could say that it was partly due to me. If you hadn't been frightened of going to jail... ...you wouldn't have got your Bacs and your good jobs. And how are things with you, Inspector? I've been a victim of my own temperament. Yeah... yeah...! There wouldn't be a police chief amongst you? No, but we have a chief of state here on a private visit. Well, that's much better! Thank you. I'll put in a word for you with your president. Thank you. Make it soon. Stop! Stop! I'll blow them out.
