Come on, Tommy. Hurry up, it's late. Good morning, love. I think I'm running a fever, mom. To go dancing until 2 AM you were okay. Go get changed. I came back at 1 AM. Hey. - I don't have time. - But... I'll handle it. Coming! What happens, Amadeo? Daddy's coming. Stop it, stop it! After school, we'll play tennis. I'm tired, dad. You're tired to play tennis? You're 16. Yeah. What happens, Amadeo? Tommy, remember you must see the dentist today. Amadeo. - Your milk shakes. - Thanks, dad. Won't you wash the blender? I don't have time. DAYS WITHOUT SMOKING: 3027 Morning, Antonio! Good morning, Antonio. SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE DAYS LATER - You're getting the fillet down wrong. - Sorry. I didn't realize. Try to be more careful with the cleaver. Antonio, there are a couple of bad ones in the back. - How many are a couple? - Four or five. Next time, say four or five, Alberto. A couple means two. - Yes, you're right. - Okay? Set the bad ones aside, and the rest goes to Europe. Good. Marcos, we'll finish in half an hour. Today she looked at me, three times in a row. - Who? - Andrea. Andrea who? The nurse. She has a nice ass. Next Wednesday, I'll make the move. Perhaps, you can help me and tell her you heard I'm the best plumber in Mar del Plata. I won't be back next Wednesday. This was my last day. What will you buy your son? Buy? I don't know. You don't know? You should get him something. Nowadays, teenagers don't give their parents a kidney. I'll think about it. I'll figure something out. Drop me on that corner. Sure. A cake? Are you sure? During the next month, he won't be allowed to eat this stuff. I was thinking... that the shelves could look good in light green. What do you think? I was thinking of light blue, but as you wish. Okay. Next week, I'll look for some samples. We don't have to decide right now. We have time. They gave me a larger office, with a window. So... I'm happy. What are you doing, Tommy? Some math homework. Just leave it now. I have an idea. Now that you'll stay home for a month, we could hire a tutor so that she does your homework, and you get an A in all subjects; your teachers won't believe it. He doesn't need that. He's a good student. I wish I could stay home for a month. Now seriously, son. Well... You're the best son any father could ask for. You're being so brave that you make me feel the proudest man for having you as my son. - And... - Come on, dad. We want to eat cake. - We love you, you love us. - Okay. So the king, full of curiosity, ordered her to speak. And Scheherazade continued... Tommy. Wait! Bye, love. Be good. Everything will be fine, Susie. It's a routine surgery. They do thousands of these per day. It's cold. Are you okay? Tommy! Andrea... Where's Marcos? No! He was such a great guy. When? - A couple of days ago. - Two days? An embolism. They're messing with us. The system doesn't work. We need to do something. - Grab your backpack. - Yes. - Bye, dad. - Bye, love. You're still seeing Sophie? - More or less. - What does that mean? Give me a break, dad. I'm late. - Wait a minute. - I'm late! I don't like this, Tommy. I want things to be the way they were before. We never talk. - There's no need... - It's okay. No, it's not okay. Don't worry. Someone will appear. We just need to be patient. It wasn't your fault, Tommy. I was asking too much of you. I should have seen it. Forgive me. I swear I wanted to help you. But I got scared. I know. Trust me. We'll find a kidney somewhere. You'll see. I love you, dad. I love you too, son. Go. And you better tell me what happens with Sophia. Am I a good guy, Susie? What do you mean? You're the best person I know. How many persons do you know? Don't start with that. I have that weird feeling in my stomach. - Do you want me to call Gabi? - No. It's not a stomachache. I don't know what it is. It's like... Like someone's grabbing the pit of my stomach, my intestines, all the time. You must be anxious. It's normal. No, I'm not anxious. It's... It's some kind of premonition. A premonition? - That feeling you have when... - I know what a premonition is. And Marcos died a couple of days ago. Who's Marcos? I work my butt off. Right? I'm good at my job. I have money to afford a house and the kids' school, to remodel the kitchen, which I thought it was perfect. Can't I buy myself a kidney? I can't use my money, which I earned working hard, to save my life. It'll be all right. The system works. It has to. It's what everybody does. We must have faith. I've been having faith for two years. Two years. If you read the statistics... They are frightening. I've told you, you shouldn't read that stuff. Each person is different. Each experience is different. - We're good people, Antonio. - Sure. I feel like I'm the biggest asshole of the whole world. All the paperwork, the system. I feel they're laughing at us in our faces. In my yoga classes, they teach us how to visualize. You can make things happen just by visualizing them. You should come. It will be good for you. You want me to go to your yoga classes and visualize that a man will call and tell me he has a kidney for me? Yes. I wish it was that easy. I wish... I could just fall asleep, dream that someone gives me a new kidney and wake up cured. It'll be all right. I promise you. ORGAN TRANSPLANT INFORMATION SYSTEM TRANSPLANT WAITING LIST 256 ANTONIO DECOUD KIDNEY TRANSPLANT ORGAN TRAFFICKING IN ARGENTINA IN A NEAR FUTURE, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO PRINT HUMAN ORGANS IN 3D MY KIDNEY FORA HOUSE Sales fell 20 percent this year. Five points more, and we'll be on the brink of bankruptcy. We must learn from the Japanese. We must copy their precision. We've got to sell meat as if it was sushi. The most exclusive sushi... What? Did I say something funny, Funes? No. Then why the fuck are you laughing? No, I'm not laughing. Do you think Japanese people are funny? No. I would have my mother killed for the chance to replace each of you with a Japanese. - See you, Antonio. - See you. Did you cut yourself? No, it's nothing. Just a scratch. - Are you married? - No. - A girlfriend? - No. A boyfriend? But you live on your own. No, I share an apartment with Yañez from Accounting. I can't afford living on my own. - I can help you out with that. - With what? When was the last time you got a pay raise? Almost two years ago. That's a long time. Yes! That's what I tell Salazar, but he won't listen. What's your blood type? - Excuse me? - Your blood type. What is it? Why? I need to know. - I think it's A. - You think? Yes, I'm almost sure it's A. - Type A. - Type A. Don't forget to go to the infirmary before leaving. - Thanks, Antonio. - You're welcome. Hello. - Elías Montero? - That's me. Antonio Decoud. Lucy, my girlfriend. Fiancée. Pleasure, Lucy. Take a sit, please. - Would you like to order something? - Sure. Please. Two beers. I can't drink beer, Elías. Are you pregnant? - Almost two months. - Congratulations! - The first time? - Yes. From now on, your life's going to be miserable. Bring two anyway. For me, hot chocolate milk and a toasted sandwich with mayo. French or wheat bread? French bread. No. Wheat bread. With fries. And lettuce, tomato, onion and chicken. - You want anything? - No, I'm fine. How old are you, Elías? Twenty-seven. I'm twenty-three. What do you do, Antonio? I work at a meat packer. What do you do there? I'm the Manager of Production, Processing and Sales. Manager of Production, Processing and Sales. You could take a kidney from a cow. What do you do? Nothing. Don't you have a job? No. Are you looking for one? Maybe I can help you. At the plant... What? I don't think he wants to work. Working isn't for me. I've tried with several jobs. It's not for me. How do you manage? - Do you work? - Yes. Used to. At a supermarket. - But they fired me. Assholes. - Chinese people. They weren't all Chinese. - There were Bolivians, Peruvians... - Same shit. Did they know you were pregnant? Yes. - And they fired you anyway? - We should talk about the house. - Yes, sure. The house. - Yeah. Our house. Your house, obviously. First, we need to find out if we match... There's a house we like a lot. In Parque Hermoso. Lucy wants it to have lots of windows. I want a big bathtub. I want to spend hours in it. It costs 70,000 dollars. That's... a bit expensive. Please, wait. No, Elías. Lucy! Wait! Hey! Elías! Lucy! Elías! Wait. Elías is risking his life here. If it's too much for you, we have another offer... There's no need to rush things. I'll make an appointment for the tests, and I'll call you. If Elías and I match, we'll close the deal, okay? God bless you. So? How did it go? You'd better match. They hurt my arm. You can't do this. It's illegal. It's my house. It's illegal to live for free in a private building. - Private my ass! - They've always tried to kick us out! Look at what I do with your notice. Fuck off! That's it, Betty! Resist! Get out, fucking cops! We don't want you here, scumbags! Those guys again, eh? Stop fucking around with that. You'll end up smoking it, and the kid will come out retarded. What are you reading? Nothing. Tell me. No. - Tell me what you're reading. - Stop it, Lucy. What are you doing? - I'm just feeling the air. - Don't break my balls. It's not my fault that you don't know how to read. I do know how to read, stupid. - Really? - Yeah. What does it say here? Elías is an asshole. Instead of a dick, he has a peanut. - You have a peanut! - Here. Do you want it? - Open up! - Listen. Come on! The rent's due! - Go check. - I'm reading. Fuck you, Elías. Open up! Open or I'll kick it down! Here you are. Are you kidding me? It's all we have. Go check inside. Why don't you go and check the new food truck on the corner? Listen to me, kid. Don't fuck with me. Don't you know I can kick you out of here?! Tell that slacker of your boyfriend to get a job. Skinny bitch. Motherfucker. Don't let them touch each other when you arrange them. And check the temperature when you finish. Hello? Yes, it's me. Okay, I'll wait. Doctor, how are you? Thanks for calling. Are you sure? Oh, my God. No chance of error or? What are you telling me, doctor? Thank you very much. I'll talk to my cousin and call you back. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Antonio looked excited, didn't he? He's dying. I'd be excited too. You're never excited. I was thinking we could paint the walls yellow. Which walls? In our new house. Whatever you want. If you want, I can cut my leg off to get you a backyard and a pool. Today, I remembered something. What? We've been together for six years. Six years since you took me out of that madhouse. In your beat-up Méhari. And you offered me this life of comfort and pleasures. Just be quiet. We may call the baby Antonio. Antonio Montero. FOR SALE As you can see, it's quite spacious. It looked bigger from the outside. You can put a table here and a couple of sofas there, with a TV. I think I want one of those sheepskin rugs. I'll lay down there for hours, bumming around. Great! Those rugs are nice. I grew up in a house like this. - I spent the best years of my life... - I want to see the bathroom. Sure. A full bathroom. Nice. It even has a bidet. - It has no bathtub. - We told you we wanted a bathtub. There's room to install one over there. Do you want to see the kitchen? It's beautiful. It has cupboards. They've just painted them. I've checked the plans. Everything seems fine. It's a small, but cozy house. The kitchen is a bit dark. We can install some LED lights. What about the furniture? What furniture? You should buy us some furniture. Sure! No problem. Whatever you need, just tell me. I brought some sandwiches. Susana made them. Great. Let me take one. No, not this one. Take this one. Yours is good? Mustard! How disgusting! You are disgusting. I love you. - Stop it. - There must be one with no mustard. Do you have beer? No... You shouldn't drink alcohol. From now on, until the operation, just fresh water and healthy food. You have to make some effort. Are you kidding? No. I'm fucking with you, Antonio. Just bring me the food, and I'll eat it. A toast. To life. Because it's all we have. Nobody knows what the fuck happens afterwards. Maybe it's worse than this. Who knows? We have the same blood, Antonio. We're like brothers. Like brothers. Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Hey. - They just finished the countertop. - Great. - You look well today. - Do I? - Would you like some tea? Yeah. Who are those? I saw an ad on the Internet. Do you know how crazy that sounds? - Why? - Why? Because it's illegal! Lower your voice. Who says it's illegal? I'm not forcing him to do anything. It's illegal, Antonio! Let's see if I get it. I'm allowed to spend a fortune on a car or a horse... Don't start with your theories again. You can believe whatever you want, but that won't change the law. They want a house, Susie. And they don't even want a big house. They're expecting a baby, their first child. I can help them, they can help me. I don't know. It's a unique opportunity, don't you think? How much? What? How much what? How much? Not much. No. Our savings. All of them? No. We can't give two strangers all our savings. It's a fortune! It's my life. - I know, but... - But what? That money belongs to the kids. It's our life insurance. Ask them what they think. What do you want me to ask them? Susie, I can save that money again. I'm a general manager at a big company. Trust me. - Do you trust them? - The company? No. Those guys. Yes. I met them a few times. They're good kids, it shows. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I wanted to be sure. I'm desperate, Susie. The waiting list doesn't work. All that bureaucracy is bullshit. I can't take it anymore. Who are they? A young couple. Hard workers. They lost their home and need a place to live. Everyone deserves to have a place to live. - Dad? - Yes. Tincho told me that, next weekend, his father is taking him parachuting. Can I go? Tommy, it's too dangerous. No, it's not. He and his father have done it three times already. He told me it feels like flying. Like flying. Humans are not meant to fly, Tommy. Let's think about it a little bit. That's it. We have something to tell you. - What? - Some good news. Great news. Some days ago... Are we expecting someone? Not that I know of. What are you doing here? We were in the neighborhood. We wanted to say hello. It's not a good time. Why don't we talk tomorrow? Oh, hi. Hi. I'm Lucy. Susana. These are the famous Lucy and Elías. Your husband and I are compatible. I didn't know you were coming. Something smells delicious. Yes. We were having dinner. These are my children, Tomás and Linda. These are Elías and Lucy. That's what we wanted to tell you. Yes. Elías will kindly donate me one of his kidneys. Why? Well, because, when all that happened to dad... Because your old man helped us more than once. He got me a job at the meat packer. Since I know him, your old man has been like a father to me. What Elías is trying to say is that yes, he works with dad... Last week we discovered that Elías and dad are compatible. What's that? Soup. What kind of soup? Broccoli and corn. Broccoli? That's not food. We always eat what dad can eat. To support him. Great idea. Kids, why don't you go upstairs? - Who's that? - Amadeo. - You have a baby? - Yes. No! He's three years old. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Can I come with you? Sure. That's my dad's place. Don't worry, Tommy. It's okay. Stay there. So, you work with my dad? Yes. Doing what? He works in the production line. He's a meat cutter. Exactly. I cut meat. I love cutting meat. You put a piece of meat in front of me... and I'll cut your meat. Maybe a nightmare woke him up. I don't think this beautiful baby has nightmares. He's like a little puppy. Lucy. I just want you to know that what you and Elías are doing is very important to us. We will use all our savings to buy your house because we trust you. And because Antonio really needs it. I mean it. We are really thankful. Arturo's so beautiful. Amadeo. FOR SALE UNDER OFFER They should be here any moment now. Hey! What are you doing, Elías? I've been waiting for you at the house. - I was here. Sorry. - Sorry. Thank you for being sorry, but what do you mean by that? The thing is... Lucy. What's wrong with Lucy? She doesn't like the house. What? She says she wants another one. What are you talking about? It's not the house of our dreams. Of your dreams? It's the house you chose. It was the one you wanted. Yeah. We don't like it anymore. Now you don't like it either. No. We want this one. My house? Yes. Lucy loved it. She felt it was very comfortable. So did I. How nice. That's impossible. We don't think it's impossible. I don't have any more money. I only have 30 thousand dollars left. I'll give them to you, and you can build an extra room. - Is it okay? - No. We want this one. Do you know how expensive it is to maintain it? I work my butt off every day and it's hardly enough. How are you going to afford it? I want to talk to Lucy. - Where is she? - We both feel the same way. We know what we want. You don't know shit. I can't give this house away. It belongs to my family. Are you out of your mind or what? It's your life, Antonio. It's your choice. You know what? You can go fuck yourself, asshole! You won't get shit, not this house nor the other one. Son of a bitch! You can go on freezing off in that hole you're living in. And I hope Lucy makes you work like a slave all your life. Screw you, son of a bitch! Hello? Hello? Hello? Could you put me through to doctor Santoro? Doctor Santoro, from the hospital. Is it the San Miguel de la Paz hospital, in Bolivia? Miss, I'm calling from Argentina. I heard there you can buy... Hello? Hello? Hello? Do you wanna buy? I have good stuff. Hey, handsome. - Hi. - Good evening. - Where are we going? - Sorry... What is it? You don't like me? No, it's not that. Well, for 800, you can do whatever you want to me. Look at this thick vein you have here. Yes. It smells good in here. Is it lavender? Yes, my wife put it. Then, we're not going to your house. Don't worry. Turn left at the comer. There's a dark storehouse. Nobody will see us. I'll do whatever you want. - Look... - What? I'm sorry, but that's not what I came here for. What? What did you come for? - What happens? - Nothing. Can I show you something? Yes, sweetie. You can show me whatever you want. It's 800. In advance. Yes, sure. Just a second. Here you are. - Brand new bills. - Yes. Could you read this? - Do you want me to read? - Yes. Just that. What's this? A deal. It's very simple. We should go through some blood tests to see if we match. What blood tests? - No, but... - Are you crazy? Blood tests? - You're a pervert! - No, I'm not. - You're sick! - Sorry. You're the typical old pervert who takes it up his ass! You filthy, trannie-hater, cum-sucker! Why don't you go and fuck yourself with your tiny dick?! Why do you come here asking for that? You're a son of a bitch! Girls, come here! What happened? Asshole! No, please. Son of a bitch! We'll destroy your car! Son of a bitch! What I'm trying to say is that these twenty years of success wouldn't have been possible without the invaluable support of four people. First, doctor Santiago Morino. I learned everything from him, to realize the great responsibility that's being in charge of somebody's life. Second, Tincho McDonough. He taught me how to forget everything I had learned with Santiago Morino and to understand that saving people's lives wasn't nearly as much fun as making them look extremely good. Third, my friend, Antonio Decoud. Let me tell you something. When we were young, I was a mess. I sniffed anything I could get my hands on. What's more: There were days when I woke up convinced that I was already dead. Antonio, you were so patient with me. If you hadn't grabbed me by the balls and thrown me into that clinic... Thank you. And finally, Jose. You're the most important thing that happened to me. I know. If it wasn't for you... Okay. Fuck. Let's get drunk, everybody! Stop fucking around with that. We should've taken the little house. They left another notice today. What notice? An eviction notice, asshole. Why do we want a house? I think this time's for real. Antonio will call. He needs it. He needs me. He needs us. I think he moved. Who? The baby. Come. Feel it. It's a fetus, not a baby. - Feel it. - It's like a Cheeto. If I tell you he's moving, he's moving, okay? What? What? I'm getting you a house, Lucy. A giant house. How much time people need to work to buy a house? What the fuck is going on with you? I've been watching you. You look like a zombie. - I'm fine. - Is it Tommy? Are you still worried? - No. - What then? - Hi, doctor. - Hey, how are you? What a cutie. I'm just feeling a bit down these days. I don't know. I hope you haven't missed any dialysis sessions. No. Never. Is there anything I can do? - What can I do? - I'm fine. Don't worry. Where are you going? What are you talking about? Tits, Susana. Giant, hairy tits, like gorilla heads. It's the new craze. That's over. Don't you think? What is this? Soda water with lemon. Did I ask you to get me this? No. Soda water with lemon. Are you okay? No. I'm dying. - Let's go to my office. - No. I'm enjoying my soda water. Don't you see? This has been my life. Every day, soda water with lemon. Soda water with lemon. I never told you something, Gabi. I always envied you in our college days. - Don't be stupid. I was a mess. - I know you were a mess. I wish I was a mess. I hate this. Knowing precisely what is going to happen tomorrow. And the next day. And the next one. - Let's go home. - Sure, home. No. Let me finish, Susana, my soda water with lemon. We have to give it to them, Susie. What? Our house. We have to give it to them. What are you talking about? Lucy wants our house now. I don't get it. And the house in Parque Hermoso? - I thought it was enough... - Didn't you hear? They don't want it anymore. They want our house. Period. But it's our house! I worked so hard to take care of it! And I worked my butt off to pay for it! Who cares now? - What the fuck is a house for if? - Don't treat me like I'm stupid! You always do that, and I end up doing what you want. I hate myself sometimes. I don't get why you can't trust the system like everybody else! The dialysis keeps you healthy... The dialysis works until it doesn't. You know that. All I know is we can't give them our house. We have to. No! It's not a reasonable deal! What are you doing? Get back in the car! - What if it doesn't work? - What? What if the new kidney doesn't? Shouldn't we wait until we are sure? That's not how it works. What if something goes wrong? Did you think about that? During or after the surgery? What happens if you die? I won't die. How can you be so sure? You keep talking about the waiting list and how everybody is against you, trying to stop you from getting your fucking kidney? But you never talk about us. What will happen to us? You've got your mom's apartment. What? - One day, she'll die and... - You want me to kill her? So that you can give our house to those guys? No, everything will be fine! You'll be fine. I'll be fine. This will work. All we have to do is give them our house! That's all! Those guys are dangerous. You're putting your life in the hands of two lunatics. This is your fault, you know it. What?! I saw you talking to Tomás, filling his head with ideas. Have you gone mad?! The disease finally got into your brain! No, it's crystal-clear now. And I know what we have to do is give them our house. We'll save the money again. What are you doing? I'm out of here! Susana, please. I'm fed up, Antonio. - With what? - With you and your selfishness! I left everything for our family! It's been two years I live for you, but you can't see it! - Of course I see it. - No! You were going to open our kid up, and you couldn't see it either! What did you tell Tomás? What did you tell Tomás?! I hope you die, son of a bitch! I want to stay here, with dad. Why does he have to stay alone? This isn't our home anymore. We're staying at grandma's. Get in the car. Close the trunk. Come on. Buckle your brother in. Hi, Susie. Well, I can't ever reach you. Can you tell the kids I'll pick them up after school tomorrow? Well... Bye. I miss you all very much. Take care. What are you doing here? We came to see our house. Why is it so dark? I was about to go to bed. Elías, wait. Elías. No TV. No, only in the bedrooms. Here, in the kitchen, I'll put one of those giant TVs. A smart TV. You have one of those? You can't move a thing until after the surgery. When will the kitchen be ready? Where are the kids? With Susana, at my mother-in-law's. Why? I'm starving. - Is there any food here? - No, nothing. Nothing. Listen, I want you to understand something. The house won't be yours until after the surgery. Is that clear? - It won't? - No. I have everything arranged for the 23. My lawyers are working on the permits. When we're in the operating room, fifteen seconds before they give us the anesthetic, we'll sign the paperwork. At what time on the 23? Do you have anything more important to do? - No. - At 8.30. In the morning? Yes, Elías. 8.30 in the morning. I'm going upstairs, Lucy. No, wait. You can't touch anything. Do you hear me? Anything. Poor Antonio. They left you alone. How old are you? Fifty-five. That's weird. What? What is weird? You don't look like you're dying. Linda. Why are you here? Who's that? He works with my dad. Nice car. Get in. I'll give you a ride. Go. Go! What were you doing? Nothing. I'm waiting for my dad. Where's Lucy? Lucy's dead. The baby grew up too fast and killed her. A space issue... apparently. It's not funny. Where's your boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend. Your classmates are idiots, aren't they? No. What do you have there? On your forehead. No. Come here. Come closer. A little closer. - Where's Linda? - She got out earlier, I think. - Didn't she tell you anything? - No. Can I go and pick my bed up? Grandma's mattress is a rock. No, we can't touch anything from the house. Really. We can't... Dad. Linda! Elías! Don't worry. Very soon, I'll come and get you. Everything will be fine. My dad called me skinny all the time. Skinny, come here. Skinny, go there. He called even fat people skinny. Skinny... it's late already. Why don't you go to sleep? What the fuck? Are you stupid? Sorry. I didn't see you. Elías Montero. Elsa. - Elsa and Elías. Almost the same. - Yeah, almost. Don't squeeze. - Do you have a house? - No, I don't. - I've just bought a two-story. - Great. In a fancy neighborhood. You probably sleep here, in the bathroom. - You've ever had a kidney taken out? - No. - Any other organs? - No. - The appendix? - No. Nothing. It must be weird to have a hole in your belly. I'll ask them to put... a zipper on the scar to keep the car keys, my wallet, my driver's license... What are you doing, mother fucker? Where the fuck have you been? I went out for a beer. Where have you been, fucking drunkard? - Stop it. - Where have you been? - I was drinking beer. Stop it. - Drinking beer? And how do you pay for them? I spent the whole day here, in this shithole, trying to get something to eat, and you use our little money to get wasted?! - They were just two beers. - Just two beers? Elías... the doctor said you must take care of yourself. Of yourself and of your kidney. You can't drink alcohol. - I'm tired. - No, you're not tired. No. You have to think of your son. Our son. Antonio, okay? - I think of my son every day. - Yeah. I'm getting him a house. Yes, a very nice house, with a back yard. But if you keep on drinking, they won't give us anything. Us? They'll give it to me. No. No. They'll give it to both of us. Okay? The house is mine. No. It'll belong to the two of us, it'll be in both our names. - No. - Yes. Yes, Elías. This was my idea. But it's my kidney. I don't give a shit that it's your kidney! It was my idea, and you won't screw me over! You won't leave me with nothing, you hear me? - Stop it! - You won't screw me over! - Who is it? - Lucy. Open the door. He came back drunk, started throwing things at me! He's out of his mind! Who? Elías! You have to help me, Antonio. Elías has changed. He lies around the whole day. - Well, that's... - Drinking. - Drinking? - Yes. I explained to him that he can't drink, or we won't be able to help you. And he threatened me. What did he say? Horrible things. That I should get a job to pay the bills of this house, and I told him I couldn't do that because of Antonio. What do I have to do with anything? No, not you. Our Antonio. You'll call him Antonio? And then I started to understand. Elías has a plan. He wants to keep the kidney and the house. He'll screw both of us over. What are we going to do? With what? With you. With your... problem. It can't be so hard to get a kidney. That's a thing Elías has. He says yes at first, but then it's hard for him to move forward. You have to help him, Antonio. You have to give him a little push. What do you mean? Enough, enough. I'm going back to bed. Wait. Can I stay? Just for the night. I have nowhere to go. You can sleep on the couch. Susie... - What are you doing? - I felt lonely down there. - Are you crazy? No. - Call me Susana, if you want. No, please. No, no... Go get your stuff. I'll wait here. Hurry up, love. Tommy, come here now! Susie, wait. Please! Wait, please. It's not what you're thinking. She brought some stuff before moving in. Please. Susie, please! You gave them our house! And now you fucked that whore! Get off. Let's have breakfast. Tomás! Susana! Tomás, I miss you, my son. I miss you. It's okay. You wanted to help me, but you got scared. I was scared too. Did mom make you change your mind? Stop! Susana, please! Susana, Susana! Which flavor did you get? - Pea. - You always buy pea. There are other flavors. - Corn, tomato, pumpkin. - Drink it up. What are you doing? It has lumps. You blended it wrong. Don't be a pussy. Drink it up. I'm sorry. For? For everything. I've been acting like a fool. I'm scared. But I'll do it. For you. - Stick your fingers. - What? Stick them down your throat. Do as I say, Elías! Stick them down your throat! - Lucy? - Graciela? Is that you? Graciela? Lucy? Lucy? Get out of here! Come on. Are you ready? Leave us alone! Help me carry him to the car. No. It's too late to change your mind. Come on! Come on, let's go! Here. It's what we agreed. It's yours, take it. Okay. Let's go. - You gave him the dose I told you? - Yes. - Did you? - Yes. Take him by the feet. Come on. Pick him up. Let's do it together. - What is it? - No! Get out of here, Antonio! Leave us alone! You're going to kill me? Go ahead, kill me. Go ahead. Go ahead. Kill me. I can do it by myself. By myself. Nobody does anything. I'm the one who does everything. Country of slackers. They say we'll do it, I'll help you. But then they don't. Nobody helps. I do it. Me, always. I must do everything. - Who is it? - It's me, Gabi. I need to talk to you. What is it? Are you okay, Antonio? Yeah... Do you need anything? What are you doing with that? Put it down. What are you doing? You have to come with me, Gabi. - Where to? - The clinic. Let's go. What? Are you insane? I'm saner than ever. I promise. Come with me. I'm not going anywhere. First, tell me what happens! - I'm not fucking around. - I believe you. Put it down. - Gabi, who are you talking to? - Nobody. I'm coming. What is it? - Antonio, how are you? - Fine, and you? Fine. Come on. Let's go. Get the keys. Okay. They're on my desk. Calm down. I'm okay. Don't try anything! - I won't! - Don't try anything! - Are you okay? - Don't worry, Susana. Nothing will happen. It's okay. - Susana knows you're here? - No, she doesn't. Nobody knows. Nobody ever will. - The keys. - You didn't do anything, right? - We'll be right back. - No. She's coming with us. - Where to? - Stop it, let's go! Come on! Let's go, Susie! - Could you put the gun down? - No, I'm fed up, Gabi. With what? With nobody doing what I ask for. What are you talking about? They forced me into this madness. - Who forced you? - Everybody! All of you! This guy that's on the back, Lucy, the fucking system, Susana. You need to be dying for people to understand you. - But I thought dialysis... - Dialysis my ass! Dialysis is useless! Fuck dialysis! I'm a good man, I do things right, I work my fucking ass off, for God's sake! I've always played by the rules. My whole life. I missed the best things in life because of that. Now, I have no choice. If I do the right thing, I die. And that can't be the right thing. Do you realize what we're getting into? We're not killing anyone. We're just enforcing a deal. A deal that was already made with this filthy bastard! Now, I want my kidney! You owe me, Gabi. I don't think I can do it. You can. You studied for that. Have you forgotten? It's been ages since I operated inside the body. - Cut the crap! It's like riding a bike. - I'm being serious, asshole! People died in my OR! I won't die. I swear. What about him? Watch out! What did you give him? Don't worry. He won't wake up. - Could you put the gun down? - Yes. Put it away, Antonio. Give it to me. Give it to me. - Give it to me. Give it to me. - No. You won't use it. Give it to me. - What are you doing? - Saving you from shooting yourself. We will help you. We need to talk to Rita. - Who's Rita? - The nurse on duty. Tell her to go to the OR. - I don't want to involve anyone else. - We can trust her. I can't feel my ears. What happens, Teresa? What are you doing here? My ears. I can't feel them. Don't worry. No one can feel their ears. - Who is he? - Nobody. - Why can't I feel my ears? - You took analgesics. - Now you'll feel a bit tired. - Oh, yes. Remember we went fishing to Corrientes, ten years ago? I'll never forget what you said. Never. You told me: Take care. You must look after your body as if it was a car. To change the brake fluid, the oil... You told me that. All these years, I looked after my body as if it was a valuable machine, and look how it turned out? Wait for me in the office. This is going to take a while. No. I want to see. This is not a game, Antonio. I want to see, Gabi. I want to. - So? How are we doing? - Great. About to steal a kidney. Are you okay? Holy shit! - Where's Rita? - She told me she was coming. Coming? What the fuck? She must be here! Go get her! Bring me my jacket. My jacket. Bring it to me. What are you doing? It's your life, Antonio. Rita, he's my best friend, Antonio Decoud. He's here because he needs our help. I want a pay raise. Fine. We'll discuss it tomorrow. Three times my current salary. Three times? Done. Whatever you need, Rita. Scalpel. ENJOY IT! BREAKING NEWS EVICTION UNDER WAY - Good morning. Lucy? - Yes. Has he woken up? Once. When they brought him. But he fell asleep again. He's very tired. Did you move him? No. Did you change the solution? I did everything Josefina told me. What happened? You did it. What's this? It hurts. It's all right. Rita's here to help us, in case we need something. We're home. Good morning. I'll take your blood pressure. A lipo? Yes. I could never follow a diet. Do you want one? You know what? Nobody dies for a smoke. TO THE MEMORY OF PELAYO GUTlÉRREZ (1965-2017)
