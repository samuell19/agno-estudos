Hey. Hey, Larry. Look, I'm sorry I got behind. You said that last month. Well, business has been slow this past year, but it's starting to pick up and when I get back, I got at least three jobs lined up. So, why can't you just cut me some slack? We did that last month and the month before that. What can you pay me now? Nothing. I'm tapped. Well, I can't help you. Wait. Larry... Been a while, Joe. How's the business? Just ring it up, Ricardo. Can I interest you in our dessert cart? Keep the change. Hey! You don't understand. We don't hurt women down south. No. Please, stop, stop! You all right? No! Please, stop! Next time, why don't you wrestle a man-gator? Stop! Oh, Shit! What did you do? I saved you. No, you screwed it all up! Hey. Hey! Hey, buster, the state troopers are coming, I'm gonna need you to explain what just happened. Okay. Hello? You hear me'? Speaking. Yes. Wha... When? What? Thank God. Thank you so much. Okay, I... I will be there as soon as possible. Yes. My daughter's out of the coma, but it's still touch and go. What? Coma? Hey, hey. Hey. God... Wake up! Look, want some no-drowsy? No. No, no. Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor. Keeps the blood vessels from opening back up. Do you have kids? Do I have kids? I don't know, a family? Wife and daughter. You like? Oh, beautiful. Oops. They're dead. That's terrible. I mean, I'm sorry. Well, I... I have an 18-year-old daughter. Her name is Billie, and this morning, she had a terrible accident. I got the call, like, an hour before you showed up. What the hell does that have to do with getting strangled? Look, I don't expect you to understand this, okay? But it was the only way I could help my daughter. God, I'm so over this shit. I don't know, could you give me a lift to Mobile? Is that a siren? That was a siren, wasn't it? I don't know. Billie is such a gearhead. Loves to ride. Says it's like flying. Dumb kid. When I heard that she was in a coma, I found that guy at the truck stop. Look, I understand what this all feels like. I really do and I'm very sorry about what happened to your daughter, but this strangling business is insane. You are aware of that, right? You think so? Did I say something funny? I... I haven't even gotten to the crazy part. Here it goes. When I was a teenager, I almost drowned. I was sliding on this frozen lake with my friend and the ice broke. Seconds later, these guys that were driving by the lake, they stopped and they pulled us out. You're saying you left your body? Yeah. I've done it a few times. Has to feel like I'm drowning, so I asked this boy who I knew to choke me. He thought it was a sex thing. What did you mean when you said that I screwed things up back there? What did that mean? It's okay, she found her way back all by herself. How can you know that? How are you sure about something like that? How can anybody be sure about something like that? What if she didn't? I can't be sure, but it's exhausting to leave my body, I don't... I'm not sure I could do it twice in a day. You know, I was only trying to help back there. I know. Thanks. Who knows what is really possible? If you could save somebody like that, that would... be a miracle. Hey, Mama. How are you doing? Mama's here. Who's that? Oh. That's Joe. He's my friend. Mama... I don't know what happened... ...but I don't wanna go back there. Why is she... Ma'am. Gonna ask you to step outside. Get the crash cart! I don't... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I need to get through, please. Come with me, please. Maybe here. Okay? It's okay, it's just... Can we... Can you do it? Do it? Now. Please. It's just I... I don't have a lot of time. I can bring her back, but I need your help. Okay? Please. You'll be fine, okay? Just do it, okay? Okay? Clear. You know what I remember most? Is that when he left, he walked all the way out to his car without ever looking back. Not once. Now, you do not know your daughter, do you? No. Are you okay? Did it work? I don't know. Is she okay? She's stable. You did good. She's back where she belongs. She will not leave again. Thanks for looking after her. Keep an eye on her. She has been to the other side. Okay. Julie, do you want some coffee? No, that's all right, thanks. That's right. Caffeine's a... ...con... Constrictor. Ah. So, when you go to the other side... do you just see people you know... or are there other people there? Um... Sometimes. I mean, can you talk to them? I mean, can... Can you give someone a message? Did I do something wrong? No, no, I just... I just have a headache. I'm just tired, and I've never done it twice in one day. Actually, I... I might just lie down for a minute. Do you want me to stay here? I can let you know if she wakes up. Really? You don't have to go? Well, I have to get the load to Biloxi, but I can stay a couple hours and still get there by noon. Uh, wow. That... That's so nice. Uh, that would be awesome. Cool. Thanks. Well, I'll let you rest. Thanks. Why do you leave me alone? You know I don't do good alone. I don't want to, but you married a truck driver. What can I do? Don't you ever leave me alone again. Hey, Julie, we came to see how Billie's doing, but, um... They said, "Just family." Is she okay? How is she? How is she? She's in a hospital! How do you think she is, you moron? I'm sorry. Sorry. She could've died. You all could've died! You know what? Get the fuck out of here! Get out of my face. It's gonna be different, right, Joe? It's gonna be different. We can rebuild, we can make up for lost time. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm a friend of your mother's, Joe. Remember? Of course I remember. I'm gonna get your mom. No. Wait a minute. Yes? Just... I just wanna look at you. Okay. It's been forever. Okay. I'm gonna let your mom know you're awake. Don't be gone too long. I won't. Julie. Julie. Billie's awake. Oh, okay. How is she? She's good. Mom? Yeah. How do you feel? Did you see the doctor? How long was I asleep? I... I'm okay. It's just... It's so bright in here. Oh, God, I was so scared. You're still here. I... I can go. No. Just thought I dreamt you. So bright. Do you want me to get the nurse? No. Don't leave me alone. I don't do good on my own. No, no. I... I won't go anywhere. That's me. Why don't you come in for a cup of coffee? It's still a long haul to Biloxi. I missed you, Majors. Hey. It's all I ever did. You were gone so much. Just sit in that house and miss you. I told you that I'm not good on my own. Not with our child... not with myself. It was dangerous to do that. Oh, man! Oh, shit. Sorry. Coffee. Smells good. Right. No, no. If I drink that, I'm so tired, I'll never make it out the door, let alone Biloxi. Just a little bit. You deserve it. Just a little. Cheers. You're a strange bird. Where are you from? Uh, multiple places. And somehow you... showed up tonight. You know... without your help... my daughter would be gone now. No, I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. You're a good man. I... I smell like three days on the road. I like it. You know, I haven't... I haven't really been with anyone since my wife and daughter... You know, I... Right. I don't even remember how to have sex. Sex. Well, I remember. I can show you. You remember? Oh, really? You wanna have sex? Hmm? I was... We can stop right now. No. Are you sure? I don't think that's necessary. Okay. So, how did a nice German gal like you wind up in the US of A, driving a big rig? I, um... I married a marine in Germany. His name was Chuck and, urn... we came here and... moved all over. I liked it. Billie was born and... life was great. And then he got sent to Iraq and Afghanistan. Oh, shit. Yeah. And when he came back, he didn't really, you know... until he left for good. Why? It was all my fault. I... I shouldn't have told him about my... Ability? Yeah, he, um... wanted me to look for his friends and I did, but I couldn't... I couldn't find them. And it didn't matter anymore at some point because he started seeing them himself. That's when he left. I'm so tired. Where's your room? Where's her room'? Down the hall, on the right. You know, the more you rest, the more you'll heal. And the more you heal, uh, the better you'll feel. So, eat your beans with every meal. I'm sorry, I thought we were doing a rhyming thing. Let us know if you need anything. Don't leave me. You're always leaving me, and I don't do well on my own. Sorry? No kiss goodbye? Try and get some rest. She's in bed. Thanks. All that? I know. It... It will be hard to keep it all straight, like, what's she taking and how many and when, you know? After three days of sleeping in a chair, I don't have enough brain to even deal with one of these child-proof caps. I'm sorry. I'm okay. Thank you, Joe, for everything you did. I couldn't have done it without you. Yes, ma'am, I'm very glad I could help. You really went out of your way to help us, you know. Nobody does that. We don't have family here. You know how hard it is to be on the road and... try to make a living. Well, I don't know much about raising children, but it looks like you've done a... A good job. I don't know. I wish I would've been here more. You know, kept an eye on her. Maybe she would be taking college classes now, instead of racing with those idiots. She's a kid. You have to make stupid mistakes when you're young, otherwise you won't regret anything when you're old. That sounds terrible, like one of those inspirational cat posters. That's how I let myself off the hook. I just feel like this accident was my fault. If I had been around more, she wouldn't have fucked off with the wrong crowd. BabyÂ»- you do what you have to do. Working's not optional. Hmm? Mmm. Mmm. Can you stay a little bit longer? I'd love to, but I really gotta get the load to Biloxi. I'm already three days behind schedule. They're gonna kill me. I'm sorry. No, no. No, it's not your fault. I mean, I... I know what you were going through. I know what it feels like to lose someone. But you brought her back. Yeah, just... Just being a tiny little part of that makes everything feel a little less dark. Hold me, baby. Mmm. Hold daddy tight. Well, I really gotta hit the road. Okay. I'll check in on you when I'm heading back, okay? Okay. Get out of here. Giddy up. So, you're not gonna pay me? Yeah, I'm gonna pay you, what you got coming minus the late penalties. That's dog shit. That's not even bullshit. Look... That's just dog shit. You have been a boil on my ass ever since you walked in this door. My company says I gotta pay you 18 dollars and 46 cents, so I tell you what... keep the change. Hey, Joe. Joe, man, come outside. They're taking your truck. What the hell are you doing, huh? All right. Okay, here we go. This is where I say, "I wouldn't do that." You ignore me and then my partner here, he hits you so hard, we gotta contact next of kin. All right. Can you just... All right, just... Just hear me out. There was an accident, okay? This woman, her daughter was in a coma and I had to drive her to a hospital in Mobile, so just have a heart, kindness, charity. Sure. Well, that's a very elaborate sob story there, buddy. You should sell that shit to Telenovela. You're gonna take my truck? A man without a truck isn't a man. You know that, right? I'm taking your truck. Sorry, buddy. At least... Just... Okay, just let me... Let me get my personal belongings, in the box. Can I get that? No. First, you pay your past due, then you square up with Larry, then, maybe, you get your truck back. Hi. Hey. Hey. We came to see how Billie's doing. Billie's okay, for a girl that almost got killed in a terrible wreck. I know, right? I'm surprised she's not smeared all over the highway. She fell in with the wrong crowd. Bunch of assholes. She means us, Rick. Oh, really? I mean, we kinda suck, but I don't think we're, like, that influential... Look, I'm sorry. It kills me what happened to Billie... but it was an accident. It wasn't anyone's fault. Really? We try to watch out for her, for each other. But you can't keep up with Billie. Not on a motorcycle, nobody can. Say hi. Take her lunch. Not while she's on real drugs. Hey. Hungry? You're lucky. Really lucky. What do you remember about the accident? Not much. I remember after... ...but before, not much. What about getting on the highway? Nope. Do you remember anything before the accident? Not really. Really? Do you have amnesia or... What did the doctor say? I don't remember. Hello? Hey, how're you doing? I've been okay. What about you? How's Billie? She seems better. Do you need some help? Let's just say that would not suck, at all. Everything all right? Well, um... Well... Why don't you come and stay with us? I could use the help, the company. Okay? Thanks, Julie. That... That's a... That's a real big help right now. Okay. See you soon. Bye. Nobody has this many friends. You're texting your friends? Look, I don't mind waiting on you, but maybe you could, uh, pick up the trash, huh? It's right here. Right here. Yep. What do you want? I don't know. I want you to be my Billie again. You know, help like you used to. We are a team, remember? We have so much to be thankful for. Yeah, you're right. I thought I lost you. You're all I have. I don't know what I would do without you. Hey, I'm back. Hey. You're in a good mood. Well, I'm happy to be back. Yeah, come on in. All right. What do you got to drink? A beer? No, I like bourbon. On. Everybody asleep? I'm just playin'. How're you doin'? I missed you. I'm great. You know I missed you? I missed you. I missed you. Yeah. Roll in, roll in, roll in. No, I said, roll in. Yeah. We're, like, falling now. Roll this way. In, in, in. Whoo! Mmm. Beautiful weed. Yeah, it should be. I... I took it from Billie's friend and Mike is a dope dealer. You know what I mean? Billie... Billie's good? Huh? Billie's good? Yeah, you know, she's getting better, like, physically. But, um, I don't know, she, um... She's not really her old self, you know. I don't know. Mmm. Well, she did take a pretty good knock on the head. Wait, what? What? I don't know. What? It's so wrong. I mean... It's so wrong. You don't just... You don't... You don't just recover from something like that and bounce back, even if she is a teenager. Right. Well, I think that you think that I'm overthinking it, but you didn't know her before. Uh, no, no. No. According to her, we're old buddies, and that's weird. Well... Don't be surprised if she's making goo-goo eyes at you just to piss me off. Goo-goo eyes. You know, you know what that looks like. Shh, shh. Shh. Goo-goo eye... So, where am I slee... Where am I sleeping tonight? Where am I sleeping? Where am I... On the couch. On the what? On the couch. Ca-ouch! That hurts. Well, I, um... My daughter's at home and I never bring men here. No, I... I understand. Okay. She, uh... She asleep? Um... Yeah, she took, like, a Percocet or two, like, three hours ago. She'd be sleeping longer. I should probably start hitting the couch then. Oh, my God, what are you doing? Well, I hope you don't mind, I... I like to sleep in the nude. I hope that's not a problem. That a problem? That's actually a huge problem. Why is that? That's a huge problem, like, this is just a huge problem. It's a problem? Just relax, just relax. I don't know. You're too loud. You're so loud... Don't yell. You're yelling. Do you remember that movie, The Exorcist? The movie, Exorcist. You remember Linda Blair when she had the crucifix? Who? She went, "Fuck me! Fuck me!" Shh. Fuck me! Say it like her. Fuck me! Say, "Fuck me." Okay, okay. Yeah, I am. Shh. Fuck me! Can you do it like Linda Blair? Fuck me! Say it. Woohoo! Too loud. You're too loud. I'm really working it up here. I know you don't see me, but... Yeah, awesome. Like what would... What would we see? I feel like getting some air conditioning. Air conditioning? I feel like some air conditioning and watching a movie in the dark. Okay. Ow! Oops. Sorry. What's... What's the deal? Are you mad at me or are you just clumsy? I'm sorry. You're making me nervous. You all right? Sorry. Well, she ought to make it to Memphis. That's awesome. Is it gonna make it back? Ha! Ha! Ha! I take that as a yes. Do you want a beer? Yeah, that'd be great. I'm gonna drain the main vein. So, do you want a beer? Does the Tin Man have a sheet metal cock? Hey, baby. Do you need anything? Not yet. You guys, this is... This is good. This is... I like this. So nice to have you guys here. Love it. The animal's instincts in killing often mimic their sexual behavior, which could become violent, sometimes resulting in injury or death to the female partner. This is all part of survival in the animal kingdom. Hey, Billie. Can you help me? Billie, come help me. What? Can you help me? I'm sick. What's going on? Are you okay? I felt dizzy when I stood up, so I'm just gonna sit here for a while. I can help. That's okay. Are you guys okay with okra? Man, okra's real nice. I hate okra. Since when? Since always. Just didn't wanna hurt your feelings. Apparently, you're done with that now. Hey, no fixing that. She's not riding anymore. You want it in selling condition, don't you? I hope you didn't ask Joe to fix your bike. Didn't have to. He offered. That's nice. It is. You should ask him to stay. You're not good on your own. What are you talking about? I remember when Dad left. It was nighttime, but I was still awake. You were crying, I was crying. And it was raining, so... it felt like the whole world was crying. But you know what I remember most? Is that when he left... he walked all the way out to his car... without ever looking back. Not once. What's wrong with you? Ah, fuck. I don't give a goddamn what the law says, Larry! This is extortion, blackmail. Whatever. Okay, I'll tell you what, you go to hell. Sorry. What did he say? If I don't pay at least 500 bucks, he won't give me my personal property back. I'm guessing it's not just a pair of underwear. No, it was all of my photos of Mary and my daughter in a box. And these little cards Mary would make me for birthdays, anniversaries. Her ring was in there too. Her wedding ring? Yes. What happened to her? I'm sorry, maybe you don't... I was doing a three-day run, and Mary and I had been fighting because she hated it when I had to leave. And the last night, the last night I was gone, I would have been home by noon the next day, her stupid cigarette lit the couch on fire, old piece of shit, and the fire spread into... The fire spread into... I'm sorry, I can't say her name 'cause I get very upset. I'm sorry. She... My little girl, she's five, she was five. Well, they say that the smoke got to her before the fire did, so... But I should've stayed. I should never have left. Work's not optional. That's what I kept telling myself when I walked out the door, but this time it was different. She was scared, she was crying. I said, "Baby, I gotta go. I gotta... I gotta pay the loan on the truck, I gotta pay the mortgage on the house." Now the truck is gone, house is gone... I shouldn't have left, I... I... I should've stayed. And... And they took the last little piece of them I... I had. I'm sorry. That's terrible. "Mama. Mama." Girl, you really mangled this thing. You're lucky to be alive. Where's my mom? She said she had to go into town early. Said she had to run some errands. So, it's just us today? Yeah. Looks like it's me and you. It's open. Hey, Joe. What? Come here. You okay? Yeah. How's it going out there? That's my shirt. Used to be. So... how's it going? I got it started. Cross your fingers I can keep it running. You can fix anything. Yeah, but somewhere, your mother's crossing her fingers it won't stay running, so you gotta cancel out her vote. Well, back at it, I guess. You're fucking her, aren't you? 'Who? "Who? There's only three of us here, Majors. You're certainly not fucking me. Don't call me that. Why? It's what I always call you. How do you know my last name? Because it's my last name too. Don't do that. I missed you, Majors. I said stop it. That's all I ever did. You were gone so much. Just sit in that house... and miss you. Billie's gone. It's me... Mary. You don't know what you're saying. Mary's dead, so you... You have some respect for my wife, or I'll spank it into you. You'd never hit me. Never did. Even when I dared you... even when I hit you first. When Billie was in the hospital... her spirit left her body... and mine came in. I'm here, baby. Why are you fucking her? Huh? I know what you really want. Why are you doing this? We could have what we had before. We could have another child. Don't you miss Sarah? Don't you miss our baby girl? I was with her right until I came back to you, and I miss her every second that I'm here. How... How did you... How did you know her name? I know everything about you, Joe. About your dad. How he used to beat you. I'm your wife... and I'm Sarah's mother. You believe that woman can bring people back from the dead... why can't you believe that it's me? Because... Because I don't deserve this. I'm here. Mary. Mary. Here. I missed you. I missed you. Someone? Something? Hey. You got it. Told you I would. Where's Billie? Thank you. Asleep, in her room, I think. I... I don't know. I haven't seen her. I know everything about you, Joe. How did things go while I was gone? Good. Nothing... Nothing happened. I... I fixed her bike. Good. I'm gonna get that thing sold on Craigslist before she wakes up. Is that your wife? Yes. Pretty. Golden shower! Oh! You believe that woman can bring back the dead. Don't you miss Sarah? Don't you miss our baby girl? We could have another child. What are you doing? What does it look like? Looks like invasion of privacy. Joe is not gonna like it that you're going through his stuff. You don't know anything about him. Well... I know him better than you think. And I might ask him to stay a little bit longer. Why? Because I like him. You're just gonna fuck it up... like you did with your husband. My husband? Your father, young lady. Yeah, that's what I meant. You're so distracted. Why? Why? What do you wanna do? This? I... I was just... When Billie was in the hospital, her spirit left her body, and mine came in. What are you doing? She's gonna come between us. She's the reason we're back together. You can't hurt her. You'd be surprised at what I can do. I was. I'm not gonna let it go wrong this time. Hi. You tampered in something that was not your business. But my daughter was dying. That was our business. Now, you do not know your daughter, do you? No. No. Every soul leaves its body eventually. That is the way of things. Oh, God, you're such a little tart, such a little tart. We're gonna stay together? Wha... What... What if she finds out? You're not gonna pussy out on me this time. What are you talking about? You're not gonna pussy out on me this time. You wanna talk to me? Let's talk dirty. Read to me from Memories, Joe. Again? Yes. "They enjoyed the Arc de Triomphe. He rode your happiness... and she straddled my mouth, your tongues joining above me." I found Billie, I brought her back. You brought someone back. These spirits linger around people they have lost. Who was with you, when you crossed over to the other side? Joe. Joe was with me. Did he lose someone? Yes, um... His wife and his daughter, they died in a fire. Spirits that leave this world unexpectedly and horribly are the ones that hold on the longest. How... How do I fix it? You've done enough. This spirit may be confused, it may be weak. It... may go back where it belongs. It... It may? No, no, this is... It's not leaving. Well... Please, come on. There's gotta be a way. That way is the way you are walking now. But if you want my advice, stop. When you try to change the way of things, you never know what will happen. "Your peach juice cascaded over and upon my golden cock. I knew then that we were a family. Our tribe, our heat melting, the snow beneath us on top of the mountain as the Inwood applauded..." Oh, yeah! Oh, God! Fuck! Don't you ever leave me alone again. What was that? What was that? It was the cat. Huh? Cat? You don't... You don't have a cat. You don't have a cat! Whoo! Oh, my God! Oh, God! Julie! Julie, wait, wait. Julie. Julie. Oh, my God. Julie, that is Mary, my wife. You brought my wife back. Oh, no, no, no, no. Who you just fucked, that's... That's Billie, that's my daughter! I'm sorry to say this. Billie is dead, that is Mary. No, no, no, no, she's not dead. She's lost, okay? And that... That thing hijacked her body, and I need you to help me get her back and fix this! Oh, really? How? I... I don't know how! Fuck! Julie. ...fucking kidding me. Julie. Julie. Where is she? Where is she? She locked herself in her room. Now, I am so sorry, but... Shut the fuck up! Your voice is disgusting to me! You took advantage of me and of her! You fix this. You better fix this! What do you expect me to do? Kill my wife? Put your fucking pants on! You're gross! Well, I don't know what makes you say that. Okay, so, we're going to... Okay, and then you'll choke me, so I can get Billie... You hit her. Julie. Julie. She'll be fine. She's a tough bitch. She was gonna kill me, Joe. And I'm not ready to die, not again. Not until you're ready to come with me. Did you have to hit her so hard? We have to get out of here. Go? Go where? Home. I wanna take you home, Joe. We need some money. I got it. I have an idea. Are you coming with me? âª One, two, three, four âª âª Someday I'll feel no pain Someday I won't have a brain âª âª They'll take away the part that hurts And let the rest remain âª âª Fix me Fix my head âª âª Fix me please I don't want to be dead âª âª Someday we'll all be rich âª âª Someday I won't listen to you bitch âª âª I'll turn up the volume And give 'em all the shit to play âª âª Just for you âª âª Fix me âª Hey. You feeling better? Kinda. Just had to get out of there. My mom wouldn't stop hovering. You're looking better. Yeah. All the clean living and oxycodone. You staying? You guys got anything to eat? Yeah, I think we have some leftover waffle fries, Miracle Whip, and some Fruit Roll-Ups. You can help yourself. Cool. Get him, Joe. Hey, man. I... I think he's dead. Baby, are you okay? I didn't mean to. It was... It was an accident. Hey! Hey, man! BabyÂ»- it was him or you. Let's get out of here. Maybe... Maybe he's not dead. Maybe we should call an ambulance. It's too late. Oh, God. Hi... I... I just wanted to repo... Um... My daughter, she... Actually, she... It's okay, she's fine. Put your fucking hands up! Mike! God! What happened? Put 'em up! Put the gun down, Mike. Sit the fuck down! Sit the fuck down! Okay, okay, sitting down, okay? Please, put the gun down, Mike. Why did Billie and your friend rob us? I can explain, I can try... Why? Explain! They fucking shot Rick! What? They killed him, they almost killed me. Oh, my God. Fuck! That guy is your friend. What's he done to her? That wasn't Billie, it wasn't, okay? I know that nothing has made any sense, and I'm gonna explain it to you, but nothing that I can say is gonna make any sense. How hard did they fucking hit you? You remember this, right, baby? Sure, I do. I didn't mean to burn this place down. It all happened so quickly. I told you that I'm not good on my own. I wanted you to find us. Let's go play. Let's go play. A ghost is taking over Billie's body, like some sort of hermit crab? Mike, we can't call the police, okay? I want Billie home, I don't want her in jail. The cops are the last thing I wanna deal with. They shot Rick with my gun. Right. I'm sorry about Rick. I'm sorry. How do we find them? You have to choke me. Wouldn't just... Just shooting you be easier? You're not happy, are you, Joe? Just... taking it all in. Why'd it have to be cloudy? I wanted to see the stars. No stars where you were? I don't remember any. It's all starting to fade away now. All I remember is missing you. You want the stars, baby? I'll give you the stars. You're gonna give me the stars, Joe? I always said I would. You don't fool me, Joe. What does that mean? You never wanted any of this. I wanted you. I wanted our little girl. I was just... on the road so much, I didn't think I deserved you. Did you deserve Julie? I don't deserve anybody. You remember the plan? "Plan." That's a cute name for this insanity. It's gonna be different, right, Joe? It's gonna be different. We can rebuild. We can make up for lost time. You mean that? I do. I... I really do. I mean, I don't... understand how it happened, but... the universe has given me... And me. ...a second chance. It's a... I wanna believe you, Joe. I'm not going on the road anymore. I'm staying here. You're stuck with me. You're not gaslighting me, are you? What is it? Wha... What? Uh, I heard something. Your conscience, and it thinks you're a piece of shit. Fuck! Stay where you are. Man, that guy came after me. Mike... it's me. No, save it. You're not Billie, and it makes me sick that something like you is crawling around inside her. Mary, I just want my daughter back, okay? L__ How bad? Drop the fucking gun or I'll blow his head off. Nobody's shooting that sad bastard but me. Is she another one of your fixer-uppers, Joe? I told you that I'm not good on my own... not with our child... not with myself. It was dangerous to do that. Sarah was dead before the fire. It was harder than I thought. You... She was little, but she didn't wanna die. You... You'd never hurt her. Not her, baby. You. I wanted you to find us. I didn't mean to burn this place down. It all happened so quickly. You killed your own daughter? How about I just shoot you, Mama? Then I don't have to worry about Billie repossessing her body. Drop it, now! You wouldn't shoot Billie. You're so in love with Billie, it's fucking embarrassing. Drop the fucking gun! Mike, Mike. Drop the gun, please. Let's go play. Let's go play. Sarah. Sarah! Let's go play. Sarah! Let's go play. Let's go play. Sarah. Joe. Joe. Baby, don't. Baby... Sarah. Sarah... Joe. Mary, I just want my daughter back. Come on... What have you done? You are where you belong. No, it's too late. You're dying. You can't keep me here! Mommy. You came back for me, Mommy. Stop. Sarah... Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Hey. Who are you? I am... I'm Billie. What's going on? Where did we meet? Where? What's going on? Shop class. What do you have, amnesia, dumb-ass? Mama. Mama. Mama! What happened to her? Mommy. Billie. Billie. Billie. Mama. Mama. We have to help her. I know. But we can't! All right, Billie... What the fuck did you do? âª My folks were always Putting him down âª âª Down, down âª âª They said he came from The wrong side of town âª âª They told me he was bad But I knew he was sad âª âª That's why I fell for The leader of the pack âª âª One day my dad said Find someone new âª âª I had to tell my Jimmy we're through âª âª He stood there and asked me why âª âª But all I could do was cry âª âª I'm sorry I hurt you The leader of the pack âª Mama. Mama! âª He sort of smiled And kissed me goodbye âª âª The tears were beginning to show âª âª As he drove away on that rainy night âª âª I begged him to go slow Whether he heard âª âª I'll never know âª Why can't Joe do the fucking dishes? He doesn't do shit around here but sit on his ass. He can't even cut the lawn worth a fuck. And what do you do? You mommy him and baby him. Stop it! Please, Kirby. No, you fucking stop it! Fuck! Stop sucking the life out of me. You guys are like two fucking fleas. Draining me. Well, I'm sorry you're so disappointed in the both of us. You're fucking dis... Really? Stop. Jesus. Should burn this fucking place to the ground, is what I ought to do. Joe. Joe, no, honey. A backbone? Joe. No, he's drunk, Joe. Shut up. Don't listen to him. Do it. Please, please. Both of you, please stop. "Stop!
