(eerie music) (crickets chirping) (man and woman shouting at each other) - [Man] I do not have the choice or the option! Get in the car. (screaming) (ominous music) - Help me! (somber music) - [Man] I'm a little late. - Well that's all right dear, go on. - Okay. Doug, good to see you. - I'm just wrapping up here. - Take your time. - I'm the one working out here but it's you who looks tired. - Well I'm having some problems sleeping. - Must have a lot on your mind. I used to have a sleep problem too. - Really? What did you do? - I did the right thing. - That obviously, I don't think that's gonna work for me. - You'd be surprised. That and a good workout before bedtime, you sleep like a baby. - That sounds good. - Had a chance to look over the papers. They look agreeable. - Well we offer a good deal on coverage especially for a business with a record like yours. - You can cut the sales pitch, Ben, you got me. - And Doug, I'm just saying. - So my business is all about personal relationships, Ben. I don't need to tell you that. I'm getting a good deal but I'm mostly interested in doing business with you. - Well I appreciate that. - Could you handle my personal insurance too? - Oh sure yeah. We would have to talk about what you keep on the premises, security, all that but of course. - How'd you like working for Goldstein? - I've been working for Goldstein for five years. - You must like him. - What? It's the longest I've been anywhere. They're really good by their clients and it makes it really easy to sell. - And are they doing good by you, personally? You have the contract? - Yes, of course. - Is it all in order? - Yeah. (light music) Oh thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. Will there be anything else? - Done deal. No, nothing else, Stella, thank you, you can go home. - Oh thank you, goodnight. - Goodnight. - It's herbal, no caffeine. - It's good. - So talk to me, you happy? I ask because I might be able to help you. - Well to be honest, I have been looking around. Goldstein's good but, - But? - Well there's only so high I can go salary-wise and I'm looking to buy a house. - You married? - No, no, no. I'm not really sure I'm ever gonna be ready for that level of commitment. - Well I thought you and Donna were. - Oh no, it's been a topic of conversation many times, but, - But you're looking for a new woman as well? (chuckling) New job, new woman. No wonder you're losing sleep. - It's not like that. - That's my old keyring. It's always brought me good luck and I want you to have it. - Oh Doug, I couldn't. - Nah, folks over at Mercedes gave me this nifty new one that opens my doors. It's not exactly easy on the eyes but it's a powerful little charm. - Thank you. - We've gotta get you in a better position so you can use that newfound charm. A headhunter I know does a lot of business with good companies. Good companies looking for good men like yourself. You live in the west side, right? - Yeah. - Perfect, it's on your way home. You can drop by tonight. Well there's no reason to wait. The early bird, pal, the early bird. - Isn't it a little late for the early bird? I mean it's almost seven o'clock and I gotta meet my girlfriend for dinner at eight. - She usually works late. A night owl like yourself, it's a deal that's meant to be. Try her, you'll make your dinner date and set the wheels in motion for your future. - Thanks, Doug, very generous, thank you. - Ah. Oh listen, just do us a favor and don't mention me. It'll confuse things. Understood? - Understood. - Hey, man. You don't wanan go in there. Not after dark. (buzzing) - Hello? Hello? (knocking) - No! No! - Hello? Hello? (tense music) - May I help you? - Yes, I wasn't sure you'd be here this late. - I'm usually here this late. You are? - I'm Ben Caruso. - Looking for a job, Ben? - Looking for an improvement in my job. - That's my specialty. Take a seat. How did you hear about us? - A friend said that he knew someone who got a job through you in the past. - What's his name? - A friend of a friend. I really don't know, I'm sorry. - Well, the important thing is that you found us. Me. What is it that you do exactly? - I specialize in insurance. - What would be that improvement that you're looking for over your current situation? - Well we could start with money. And you know, work our way down. - Shoot. - Okay. 75,000. - You're making that now? - No. I wish. - Okay. I think we can work with that. As a matter of fact I am having some drinks tonight with some clients that I think you might work nicely for. - That's amazing. - Fate. - Yeah, in a word. - What are your plans tonight? Maybe you could join us. - Um, I'd like to but I can't. I'm having dinner with my girlfriend. - Your girlfriend? - Yeah, but another time. - Sure. Are you committed to your job, Ben? - Absolutely, if it's the right one, sure. - Because if I do set you up I wanna make sure you'll follow through. - Look, if you can get me a job in a good firm in the pay range that I want, it's not a sweatshop, I'll pretty much do anything for you. - Well that's good to hear. - [Donna] You want to what? - Honey, it's not like I'm leaving my job and parking my ass on the couch. I got another one lined up, a better one. - Better? - Yeah, higher pay. - Higher pay is a nice start, Ben but I mean let's get a grip. You've been at Goldstein for five years, you have a future there. - Yeah, well I'll have a future where I'm going. They're already paying me more money. - You said that. Whose idea was this, Scott's? - No, a client of mine suggested it actually. Thought I deserved a little better. I don't know why you don't. - Okay so if he feels like you deserved more then why did he send you to some late night headhunter? - First of all, he's not hiring and he highly, highly recommended this woman. - Oh, so it's a woman. - You're being ridiculous. She doesn't even have a job yet for me. She said there might be one. But you already don't want me to take it. - I'm just playing devil's advocate here. - Well you're doing an aces job. - I mean, is Scott leaving? I thought you didn't do anything without him. - I don't know what Scott's doing. I haven't even told him about it yet. - Just, use your head before you make any ridiculous moves. - Yeah, it's great to have your support. - I'm trying to keep you on track so I don't have to support you. - You wanna watch a movie? - No, I'm exhausted, I'm going to bed. I assume you'll be up late? - Yeah. I just can't sleep. - You know, you really should talk to someone about that. I mean it's not good for your health. - I know. - All right, good night. - All right, good night. (clearing throat) (static hissing) (phone ringing) Fucking cable. Hello? Hello? - [Woman] Ben? - Yes? - [Woman] Sarah Tierney. - Oh, hi. - [Sarah] Sorry for calling so late. I had drinks with that client. I may have found you that job you're looking for. - Really? - [Sarah] 75 a year. - That's amazing, are you serious? - [Sarah] Yes. Benefits, three weeks paid vacation. - You are an angel. - [Sarah] There are some negatives. - (sighing) Could you hold on a second? - Sure. - Okay. (creaking) Yeah, I'm listening. - [Sarah] It's a desk job. You're used to being on the road, dealing with clients. - No, that sounds fine. I'm sick of hotel living so desk job sounds good. - [Sarah] There's more. This one, some people drag on, others, it's a complete deal killer. - What is it? - [Sarah] Graveyard shift. - Nights? - [Sarah] They run a full day shift and don't feel it's in their best interest to expand office space. Besides Leon, the district manager, he feels the job is better served with no distractions. - What is the job? - [Sarah] Reviewing claims, numbers game. - Sarah, that's wonderful. When do I go in for the interview? Sarah? Sarah, I think I lost you. - [Sarah] You don't need to interview. You're working with me. I sold you. - So no interview? What if I don't like it? - [Sarah] You don't like it? - No, that's not what I said. What I mean is-- - [Sarah] You don't like it, let me know. You start tomorrow night. - Tomorrow? - [Sarah] They needed someone ASAP. Don't stand in fate's way, Ben. Commitment is not a four letter word. Are you in? - I'm in, I'm in. - [Sarah] Good. - [Man] So you're kidding, right? - Why would I make something like that up? - No, look, I'm happy for you, Pal, sincerely, you know? I didn't realize that you were so unhappy here. - No, I'm not unhappy. Just, I feel like I can do better. - Well I tell you man, it sounds like you are. - You ever get fed up? You like looking around, find something better? - Well I got it pretty good now. - Scott. Come on. We're the backbone of this company. I think we're worth a little more than 60 grand a year. Oh, dude, you are making 60, aren't you? - 80. Look, I'm sorry, man, I had no idea. Oh, Ben, look. Goldstein's no fool, right? I mean he knows that you're a star player here, why don't you talk to the man? You know? Look, I could see a raise in your future. Listen, Ben. Mack Daddy's out of here. I got a meeting over at Snyder's. You make the move that you feel's best. I'm always gonna be here for backup. All right, see you, man. - I can't match that offer, Ben, I'm sorry. - Are you saying you're willing to lose me? - I'm saying I won't match that figure. Translate that into any language you want. (plane whooshing) (jazzy music) - Hey, how you doing? I'm here for the graveyard shift. (wheels squeaking) Nice to meet you too. (light music) (crackling) Hello? Hello? Somebody out there? - [Man] Who are you? - I'm Ben. This is my first night, where are you? - [Man] I'm here. - Where? - [Man] Where you are. She sent you. - Um, Sarah? Hello, are you there? Hey, excuse me. Excuse me! (humming and whirrring) - So you really think you saw some guy disappear into thin air? - No, no. I'm just saying that's what it looked like. - They're hazing you. You're so naive. - Well what about the copy machine? - I don't know. I have to see the copies to tell you for sure. Maybe you were low on toner. - I thought you'd be skeptical so I brought them. Check them out. Just flip through them like an animation. - You're low on toner, all right. They're blank. - What, they're not blank! - You're stressed out, you're sleep-deprived. You're seeing things. - I don't understand. - Were you drinking last night? - No. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Sarah] It's Sarah. - Hi. - [Sarah] Did you leave early last night? - Um, no I left at three. - [Sarah] That's not an eight hour shift if you started at seven and took a lunch. - I didn't take lunch. - You got what you wanted, now you've got to deliver. - Just wait a minute, wait a minute. - [Sarah] This is a big account for me. You wanna fuck around, you should have told me. (somber music) - Who was that? - That's what she told me. Can I help you? - Uh, Sarah. I'm looking for Sarah. - Sarah? - Tierney. - There's no one by that name that works here, sir. - That's impossible, I was just here-- - There's only four of us here, I'm sure. Karen, have you ever heard of a Sarah Tierney? - No. No, I've never heard of her. - I'm sorry, maybe you're looking for the dentist's office next door? - No, she's a headhunter. Isn't that what you do here? - Headhunter? No, this is an accounting firm. Headhunter? - Who's in this office back here? - I gotta go. Sir, that's Mr. Krause's office. I think you're confused. - You're right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (light jazz music) (wheels creaking) (crackling) Yeah, I'm back, I work here. - [Man] Leave now while you still can. If you want to help, you can't do it here. A back way, sure. But certainly not here. Certainly not here. - Yeah, listen, you know, it's my second night. Can we just cut it with the hazing process, all right? And when's Leon coming back in the morning 'cause I need to ask him something about-- - [Man] I was like you once, Ben. - Really, young and handsome? - [Man] Young and alive. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Sarah] Good, you're there. - Yeah, I'm here. What the hell's going on? - [Sarah] What do you mean? - Well what do I mean, just that it's just so odd. Everything's odd. - [Sarah] It's a new job, Ben. New jobs are like that. - Yeah but there are other people working here at night, right? - [Sarah] I'm not sure, I don't work there, Ben. You do. What happened today? - Today? - [Sarah] Uh huh. - Well yeah I came by-- - [Sarah] I know, why? Mhmm, mhmm. I'm getting off work now and wanna swing by. I can bring you dinner if you want. - Sure. But Sarah, you've got-- (dial tone) (eerie music) So you're finally gonna give the new guy the time of day? (screaming) Whoah, whoah, whoah! You fucked up freak! Hey! Where'd you go, man? Where are you, come on, man, where are you? What is wrong with you, man?! (gasping) Jesus Christ! - I didn't mean to startle you, honey. - How did you get here so quickly? - I called through my car. I was nearby. - Obviously. - I just felt that it was important that we see each other tonight. - All right, what have I done now? - That's just it. I know I acted strangely and I don't know what came over me. - Are you like this with all your clients? - No. No, I'm just going through an emotional time. - Oh, hey. Easy, I just. - So how's the job? - Ah well, besides all the weird happenings, it's fine. I still can't believe they're willing to pay me so much for such an easy gig. Hey, what's wrong? Come here. What's wrong? - I'm just so lonely. - You're what? - Cold and lonely. - Do you need a jacket? - I've just worked so hard for so long. I just feel like I've traded my life for this career. It's getting to me. - Yeah, no, I can understand that. I never thought that I'd get to this age and not be married with a family. - That's just how I feel. A few years ago, I was introduced to religion. And it's really changed my life. I feel like I'm awake for the first time. Do you believe in fate? Do you believe in destiny? - Ow! - What's the matter? - It's nothing, it's just my key chain jabbed me. - It's the keychain I gave you. - You gave me? - You kept it. I'm so hot. - But you didn't give-- And I, I really should stop. - Your girlfriend doesn't love you. She doesn't wanna have a child. - How do you know? - I know. (tense music) (eerie music) (sighing) - You! Hey! (door shutting) (door creaking) You wanna tell me what your major malfunction is, pal? (creaking) (ominous music) - You're in a world of shit now, Ben. A world of shit. - What's going on here? - You should never have let her get so close to you, Ben. Didn't you feel it? - Feel what? - The coldness, of course. I couldn't find it. We pray you can. - What? - If you cannot find it before the 15th, you will die. After, you'll be doomed to suffer our fate trapped here until someone does find it. - Here? - And don't let him stop you either! His intentions may have been good but that is no longer any of our concern. Remember that. - Stop me from what? - You have two days, Ben. Two days. - What's wrong? - We just finished making love and you get up and run off? - It was the guy. - What guy? - The guy down the hall. He walks past here every night and tonight he, - [Sarah] He what? - He just, something's very wrong here. At first I thought it was those other guys hazing me and now I'm not even sure if there are other guys. What? - You're very dramatic, you know that? - Well I guess I am, but still. - Why did you come around asking about me today? - I was just concerned. - And now? - I'm not sure. I mean no one there knew you. - I had an argument earlier and left. It doesn't surprise me that they act like they didn't know me. People can be so cruel. It's been a very upsetting day. - So you quit? I mean, can headhunters do that? - Of course. Is there anything else about me you want to investigate? - No, I-- - Because I don't mind, Ben. I don't mind being the object of man's suspicions. That's old hat. - Sarah. You're taking this totally out of context. - I know. I'm sorry. You're sweet. Say hello to Donna for me, would you? (copier whirring) - [Voices] Find the head, find the head, find the head, find the head, find the head. - Can I help you? - Ah yeah, I was here the other day. - Oh that's right. What can I do for you? - With Sarah, was she fired? Is that why she's not here, why everyone was acting so odd? - Sir, I thought we already went through all this. - All right, so she never worked here and you never heard of her? - No. - What about that other woman, what's her name, Karen? - [Woman] What do you need with Karen? - Just wait, wait, please. - I'm sorry, I can't help you. - [Woman] What's going on here? - You know something, don't you? - Come with me outside, please. Who are you and what are you doing here? - Sarah. I mentioned her here the other day and no one knew anything but you. Your face went totally white. - Well wouldn't you be a little freaked out too if somebody walked into your office and said they saw your friend? Your friend who was brutally murdered? God, I should call the police but I've been so busy with just everything going on, I don't need some creep in my life. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Murdered, when? - 10 years ago. So what twisted reason could you possibly have for doing this? - That can't be her. No, I mean. I just saw her the other night here. Sarah Tierney. She's a corporate headhunter. - Sarah has been dead for 10 years. - That can't be, that can't be. - It can be because it's true. And if you're looking for Sarah, this is not the place. Excuse me. - Well where is? - The same place she's been for the past decade. St. Mark's Cemetery. (tense music) (ominous music) (gasping) (sighing) (startling) - God. Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. - What are you reading? - Nothing, I just finished. What are you doing home? - Oh, I forgot my bag. So I will see you tonight before you go to work? - Of course. Yeah, have a good day. - Okay. - All right. - You okay? - Yeah. Just tired. - Okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Yes sir Mr. Bennet will be in meetings all morning on that day. Good afternoon, Bennet Enterprises, how may I help you? - Doug Bennet, I need to speak with him. - May I ask what this is regarding? - It's personal. - Hey Ben, this is unexpected. To what do I owe the pleasure? - Oh I think you know. - I'm at a loss here. - Sarah Tierney? - Beth, could you tell Gina I'd like to see her please? What about her? - You tell me, Doug. You sent me to her and now I'm in the fucking twilight zone. - I sent you to a headhunter to help you, Ben. - Right, cut the shit, okay? I know you were suspected of killing her. You know, beyond that I don't know what to believe except that I've got what appears to be an office full of ghosts waiting for me to show up to work tonight. And this looks an awful lot like a tattoo on Sarah's chest. - Sarah and I dated years ago. She gave me that keychain. During that time, some madman killed her. - You were suspected. - I was her boyfriend, I was with her earlier that day. Of course I was suspected. But I didn't do it. Why are you doing this to me, Ben? - That headhunter address you gave me is an accounting firm, Doug. Has been for five years. Except after sunset when it turns into a fucking haunted office of horrors! - Well I haven't been there for five years myself for obvious reasons, but it was a reputable company. I gave you the most recent address. Beyond that, I don't know anything. - Really? What about where her head is? - That's a sick question. I don't know who put you up to this or why. Lord knows I have a lot of enemies but I thought you and I were friends. - Fuck you. You know something, I can see that much in your eyes. - Please leave before I'm forced to call the-- - What have you got me involved in? - I lost the woman I loved that night. That's all I know. That lack of sleep is catching up to you, Ben. It's making you see things. Worse still it's making you do things. Look at yourself Ben, you're out of control! Now I really think you should leave now. - I'm not leaving until I get some answers! - I'm afraid you are. - Oh that's cute. - This way, sir. - Get your fucking hands off me. (banging) (tense music) (zooming) - Where are you going? - Oh, god! - You are thinking of leaving town, then, weren't you? - It doesn't matter where you go. When you don't show up at work, Ben. She'll find you. She'll find you. And reprimand you. Quite severely. - This isn't real. - It is real! It is of utmost importance that you understand that. Find the head. Find it. Or be reprimanded. You can't throw away your responsibilities, Ben. (startling) (bell ringing) - I'm in rather a hurry here. What was your name again? - Ben. Ben Caruso. - You're not in one of my classes, are you? - Me, no. - Ah then what can I help you with? Quickly please. I'm afraid I have a lunch appointment and I'm very hungry. - You specialize in mideastern artifacts, is that correct? - That's not really my title, but yes. You want a audit before you take the class? - Uh, no, no, I'm not here for a class. I was actually hoping you could evaluate something for me. - Something you bought off the internet? More people get ripped off every day. Where did you get this? - It was given to me. I read some testimony you gave in a murder case a few years ago. - The Tierney murder. - Exactly. But your findings were never listed. That's why I'm here. I was hoping you might remember what they were and what this is. - Of course I do. But I don't have time now, as I've said before. - Please, Professor. This is very important. - Did Bennet send you? - No, he didn't. (sighing) - It's Persian. It represents fertility but in a negative way. Fertility of the bad, you know. The power to grow him a human husk. The dark one. Which is a more direct translation of its inscription there. - The dark one? - The devil. If you believe in that sort of thing. They thought she was killed by some cultists but I never saw any other evidence of a cult murder. - Yeah her head was missing, never found. - Besides that and the tattoo, it seems like a lot but it's a slim read to hang a case on. Now please, I feel a little uncomfortable discussing it further. Where did you get it? - [Ben] Doug Bennet. - I thought you said Bennet didn't send you. - He didn't. But he'd probably be upset to know that we spoke. - I doubt he'd be the only one. Now if you'll excuse me. - Do you, professor? - Do I what? - Believe in that sort of thing? - Yes, I do. Please don't come back here. (tense music) (banging) - [Sarah] Ben. (startling) - Time is running out, Ben. You've got one day left! (phone ringing) - Hello? Hey. Yeah, no I just came home from a jog. Yeah. No I'm taking the day off. (laughing) Sure. Yeah, you can come over. Okay. All right. That's fine. Okay, I'll, okay I gotta go. (tense music) Is anybody here? Shit! (screaming) - [Eerie Voice] You told. (sobbing in distance) - I don't wanna die, Ben. - Did Doug do this to you? - I loved you. - Did he? (squirting) - Help me. - What? (ominous music) - [Sarah] Help me, Ben. - See, that was my point, right? Now why go with a shit ass company like them when you can go with us? Yeah of course I closed the deal. I'm good and I'm right. What else do you need? Hey, yeah I got another call coming in. Okay. All right, we'll wrap later. Hello? - Scott, it's Ben. - [Scott] Hey, how goes it, buddy? - I need some help. - Yeah, what's up, shoot. - In need you to call Bennet's people, tell him we need to get into the house, check the system. - What? You don't work here anymore, I can't do that. - [Ben] I need you to. - Well what's going on? - Look, I'll tell you later. If you're just, if you're gonna do this at all, you're gonna have to trust our friendship that this is a life and death situation. - Well do you need me to get help, the cops, what? - No, no, please don't call the cops for now, okay? I just need to get into Bennet's house. - All right, look, I'm gonna make the call, okay? But you've gotta tell me, now. - If you're my friend, you'll call, okay? I'll fill you in later. But do it now 'cause I'm right outside. (sighing) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Donna] Hello, stranger. - Donna, hey. - [Donna] I come home, you're at work. I wake up, you're out running some mysterious errand. - No, I'm just, I'm just really busy right now. - [Donna] Have you eaten lunch yet? - No, but-- - [Donna] Thai dishes sound good? - Okay, sure, give me an hour. - [Donna] Okay. Okay, bye. - Bye. Hello, Stella, how are you? - Oh, that was quick. They only now just called. - Well, I was in the area. There's a problem with your alarm's modem so I'm just gonna take a look around. It shouldn't take long. - Oh, all right. Can I make you some tea? - Oh that would be wonderful. - Of course. - Thank you. I'm gonna show myself, okay? - All right, dear. (tense music) - Thanks, I appreciate it. - Ah, sorry you had to wait so long but I had to get clearance on the security company. Mr. Bennet runs a tight ship, you know what I mean? - I know, that's why he's got me on the job. This'll only take a couple seconds. - Take your time. - All right, great. (tense music) (startling) - Hey! Found what you're looking for? - No, not here. - You know, I've been in this security business quite a while myself. It's probably not unlike your business, huh? - No, I don't suppose it is. - You know what I say? Always return to the scene of the crime. I always say that, you know why? Because hey, you lose a key, you go back to where you last saw it, you find it, right? And somebody breaks into your house, it'll be after you look, you're gonna find a clue lead you right to the culprit. Am I right, you know what I'm saying? Am I right? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah you're right. - All right, well I'ma go lock up now. - You know what, uh. I'll walk out with you. - That'd be good. - All right. - Thanks. - Right. - You having an emotional breakdown here, Ben? I mean seriously, what's the catch here, man? - Look, I know how it sounds but you have to believe me. - You know what, you need a priest. Yeah, or at least some high grade valium. Look, take some time off. Actually no, strike that. You should quit. You should go on some sort of sabbatical somewhere. You know my father he did that when we were kids and we never saw him again. Yeah it must have been really, really relaxing. - You're not listening, okay? I've tried. If I don't go to work-- - Wait a second, she'll kill you with fright, right? I know, I know. Save it for the campfire, buddy, jesus! - Don't think I can't see this from your position, I can. - Okay so you believe in all this shit, right? Spirit caught between worlds, needs her head to rest in peace? - Hey, you see this? - Yeah it's cheery. - I can't get rid of the fucking thing. - So? - Okay how the fuck did you just do that? - I can't escape this. - Okay then throw it here again. Oh my god, I can't believe this. I can't fucking believe this. - Yeah neither do I. I've gotta find her head, I've gotta do it before midnight tonight. - Wait a second, don't you have to go to work? Okay I thought it was part of this, this curse. - That's where you come in, okay? I saw something today that deserves a little added attention. I need you to do a little poking around. - Well, that's my specialty. (tense music) (discordant music) - Do you know what today is? Today you join us! (wheels squeaking) (phone ringing) (sobbing) - Hello? Sarah? - [Sarah] Yes, Ben. - What's wrong? - [Sarah] You know what's wrong. They told you. And that professor told you. - Nobody told me anything, Sarah. - [Sarah] They won't be telling anyone anything ever again. - You promised me. - I didn't say anything. - You told. (tires screeching) - Wait. No, no, wait! (coughing and groaning) - You had to spill your guts. You thought you could keep him from me? (screaming) (tires screeching) - [Ben] Sarah, please, please let me go. - [Sarah] You said if I got you a job you'd do anything for me. Anything. Help me feel whole again. Help me so that I can bring him into this world. - What do you want me to do, Sarah, what? - [Sarah] If you can't find mine, bring me Donna's. - What? - [Sarah] You pathetic sack of shit. I need her fucking head. (ominous music) - Don't make the same mistake. Find it Ben, find it Ben, find it Ben, find it Ben. Find it, Ben. Find it, Ben. Find it, Ben. - You're running out of time, Ben. Donna's on her way here. You know that, don't you? She'll be here any minute. This is not good for her, not good at all. Soon you'll be trapped here. Go now, Ben. - No, not until-- (screaming) (gasping) - You have a visitor, Ben. - Donna! What are you doing here? - You missed lunch. I thought I'd come by to see why and what she looked like. - No, you don't know what you're talking about. - Where is she? Don't worry, I'd just like to meet her, Ben. You know, you've got a major commitment problem. It's a nice match to the sleep problem. - No, no, you've gotta get out of here. - I must be on to something then. - No, no, it's dangerous here especially for you. - You're really losing it, aren't you? - Donna. - Ben, I'm not leaving. - She doesn't want me, she wants you! - Oh. So she swings both ways? Nice. - Donna, I'm serious! - So am I, Ben. - [Sarah] Ben. - You leave her alone. - I don't wanna die, Ben. - You're already dead. - I don't have to be. - Stop it. Stop it! (clinking) Are you happy now, let's go, Donna, please. - Put the ax down, Ben. - Donna, I'm not gonna hurt you. - I believe you. Just put the ax down. - [Sarah] I want it! - You can't have it! - What? - It's her, can't you see her? - See what? Ben. - [Sarah] If you don't do it Ben, I will. (gasping) - Get away from me, Ben. - It's not me, Donna. - I understand that. Just get away from me! What's happening? - Donna! - You don't have much time left, Ben. There's nothing you can do here. Run. Run! - [Sarah] This head won't work, Ben. She's pregnant. She's pregnant. - All right, looks like I'm going nowhere. - Hey asshole! What the fuck do you think you're doing? - Look I thought the place was closed. - Hey, we're open 24-7. And at no time during those hours is it okay to break in. Now, what can I help you with, dick smudge? - Look, I work for Doug Bennet, okay? And I called earlier, I spoke with Mark? - Mark got off an hour ago. - Well I gave him all the clearance information. - Then I suggest you come back tomorrow morning. - I don't think Mr. Bennet is gonna be too happy about that. - I'll take my chances. Oh and by the way. Say hello to Caruso for me. - Oh fuck. - Ah tell it walking, asshole. (tense music) (snoring) (tense music) - Oh, that's a jackpot. All right. (clacking) (groaning) Ah! What the? (phone ringing) Hello? - [Ben] Hey, it's me. - Oh, you scared the crap out of me. - Was it there? - [Scott] Yeah, it's here. - Thank god. - Look, this shit's creeping me out, pal. - Not more than me. Listen, can you bring it to St. Mark's cemetery? - Why, what's going on there? - [Ben] I'm gonna reunite Sarah with her head. - All right look, I'll meet you there, okay? But look, when I get there, I'm dropping this box off and I'm running, you got that? - Got it, thanks Scott. - All right. Come on, beautiful. We're out of here. (intense music) Oh no. (bashing) (eerie voice) (bashing) (dramatic music) - Where's my head? It's almost midnight. And you promised me. You promised me. You said you'd do anything. - Scott, bring it to me. Scott, bring it to me! - Now I've come for you. - Come on, Scott! God damn it. Ah god. You asked for it, you got it. - I've come for you, Ben. (ominous music) (thunder rumbling) (knocking) - Open the door, Bennet! Open it! (knocking) - You got a lot of nerve coming here at this hour after your performance at my office. - Cut the act, Bennet. Why'd you do it? Why'd you kill her? - What are you talking about? - Don't you fucking lie to me. Listen to me, admit it! Admit it! After all I've been through tonight, at least you owe me that! - I had no choice! - You have no choice? You had no choice but to kill a defenseless woman? - Defenseless? She's evil. Pure and simple, she's not human. - Stay the fuck away from me. - I've been out with some women in my time who were into witching and witchcraft kind of shit. Sarah wasn't just into it. She was a witch. She was pregnant. And if ever that child was born, evil incarnate would walk amongst us. Darkness would overtake the world. - You're a fucking storyteller, aren't you, Douggo? - I've never been very religious but for the first time in my life, maybe the last, I felt a higher power calling me. She knew something was wrong. (screaming) - No, help me! Help me! (screaming) - I had to! Even if she had an abortion, got rid of the child, she was ripe with his seed! - This is unbelievable. - Unbelievable? You've seen it, Ben. You've seen it all. - You set me up. You petty fuck, you set me up! - Like the others, yes. It's the only way, Ben. She keeps coming back. For whatever reason, her soul is now trapped between worlds. As long as it is, we're all safe. But if the artifact helps her find me, I might weaken. I might help her find it. I might lead her back to it, to her head. (thunder rumbling) Ben, how did you survive? How did you survive? - I found it! - You found it? - Her head, I found her head in your storage unit. - You didn't give it back, did you? - What the fuck was I supposed to do?! - [Raspy Voice] Doug. (dramatic music) (shattering) - What have you done?! - I didn't know. - [Doug] Help me. God save! God save! - I need you, Doug. - Ben! Ben, my God, save me, do it! For God's sake! (zapping) (whacking) (zapping) (ominous music) (somber music) (birds chirping) - [Donna] Are you awake yet? You've been out like a light all night. It's been good to see you sleep. Hey, um, there's something I really need to talk with you about. - You're pregnant. - [Donna] Well if you know that, maybe you can tell me where my head is! - No! No, no! No!
