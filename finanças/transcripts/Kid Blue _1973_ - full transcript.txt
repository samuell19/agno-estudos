Come on. Oh! Huey! Oh, my knee. Oh, shit. What the hell are we gonna do now, Bick? I don't know what we're gonna do. But, um, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I know what I'm gonna do. All by yourself? Yep. I just want to go off and, uh, find me a town and get a job. A job? Jesus Christ, Bickford. There isn't a town in Texas would give a man like you a job. All you know how to do is rob and steal and kill. Yeah. You might be able to dig a post hole, but for the life of me, I can't even see you doing that.

Not so loud. You're new here. It's a fact. Well, say "sir" when you talk to Mr. Hendricks. That factory at the edge of town belongs to Mr. Hendricks. Now, now, Jonesy, he's just an ordinary citizen. No better than anybody else here in Dime Box. Take that spittoon out and clean it. Appears to me your trade would be delivering fruit. I'm Mean John Simpson. I believe that. But only my friends can call me that. What'd I better call you? Sheriff. Now go empty it. I'm damn tired of you getting drunk and falling on our citizens. Oh, no. Yes, siree. Happy days, that's what we have. Full dinner pail. I'll tell you, Mrs. Evans, best thing to ever happen to this town was the factory came to Dime Box. You're right. Got money now. Do you know a shop owner can charge $4 for a fine pair of kangaroo calf box shoes which is my pleasure to supply them with. We're all gonna be prosperous. Any man who wants to work can get a job here in Dime Box. And any man who doesn't want to work, in my opinion, he deserves to starve. You figure it that way, son? No, I couldn't honestly say so. Ain't you proud of being a working man? Well, maybe I'll get used to it after a while. You know, the Bible says a man must toil. Where would I get ahold of a Bible? Appears to me, Mrs. Evans, this boy ought to consult a preacher. There's such a thing as too much preaching. The way he talks, he ain't had none. That's close to what I mean. Look here, son. We're all fine Americans at this table. I don't want to be too hard on you, you being new to town and all and having no proper education. But these folks here don't like being made fun of, or anybody making fun of our Bible. Well, I ain't, uh, said nothing yet. Well, I for one, wasn't raised to share a table with no heathen. Are you talking about me, sir? Do you see any another heathens at this table? I don't know that I'd rightly recognize one if I saw one. Pass down that cornbread. Well, tell me some more about this town, Mr. Hendricks. Well, after Molly and I got married, I decided to move to Dime Box and work in the new factory. But I don't think she likes it very much. What is a factory? Well, a factory is where a lot of people make products. You see, America's growing so fast that we've got to make a lot of products for people to buy. Well, people that buy these products, uh, they get the money from making the products, right? That's how it works. How come these people don't make the products themselves and keep it? Then they won't have to go workin' in no factory. Well, you can't make these products unless you have a factory. Watch your step, honey. Factory, huh? What kind of factory is that anyway? The Great American Ceramic Novelty Company. -I work in ashtrays. -Ashtrays? Little clay bowls that you knock your ashes into, for your cigar, your cigarette. Put your ashes on the ground. Not indoors. Nobody smokes indoors. It stinks up the house. Well, Mr. Hendricks says that everybody smokes indoors back east. Even the women are smoking nowadays. He says that everybody in America is gonna be needing ashtrays to hold their ashes. Yeah. Mmm. The best thing I've ever put down my neck. I'm gonna... excuse me. Stand right here and be sociable with the sheriff. For a minute. Or as long as I say so. Yeah, about that long. You ain't said yet what you was doing in Dime Box. I never dreamed you was interested. Everything that goes on in Dime Box is of personal interest to myself. Ain't even a toad hops or a scorpion crawls with what I ain't got my eye right on his ass. Excuse them bad words, ma'am. And now the likes of you shows up and I'm sure it's for no good purpose. I saw your kind of boys before. And I know there ain't no good in you. So I'm gonna tell you right straight out, this is a good, honest town, full of hardworking folks that expect me, their sheriff, to protect them against any white trash that might be moving in. I don't know if you're getting my meaning. It'd be pretty hard to misunderstand you. And this young fellow here, he's got himself a wife. Feller needs himself a wife, so's he don't drink too much, start fighting and chasing around with harlots. You want me to get married? Yeah. But keep away from nice girls. You're a hard man to please. That's why I'm such a good sheriff. Where do you keep your gun? I ain't got no gun. Under your mattress? I ain't got no gun at all. Well, you ain't allowed to carry a gun in Dime Box unless I say so. I ain't got no gun. I ain't got no wife. All I got is a bed and board and a job. And I'm trying to be as good a citizen I can. Well, now, that's the kind of story I like to hear. Tell me that every time I ask you and I won't have to shoot you. Uh, excuse me, uh, are you an Indian? Hmm. Are you a real Indian? My daddy told me that Texas used to be crawling with Indians, but that they took them all up north to the reservation. That was before I was born. My name is Bick. Uh, Bick, you savvy? That's good. My daddy used to hunt buffalo. But that business wore out. Oh, howdy. How come you fellows left a nice place like the reservation for a place like this? We belong here. No, not in Dime Box. Well, my father lives here and, uh, his father lives here... and all my mothers lived here. I was born here. This is my place, where I am. You live in a teepee? No. We live in a stable. A stable? Well, stable's a nice, warm place. Yeah, it's very warm all summer, as cold as hell in winter. Hell is hot. You don't know. Hell is fire. Is fire cold? I don't know how I ever got here. Oh, damn. You stupid son of a bitch. Well, what's the matter? Well, look down there, you damn baboon. Well, sir, it's hard to know where to put the polish and where not to. You're supposed to stick the polish on leather. You ignorant bastard, not on the hose. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I could only suggest that, well, maybe you should wear boots until I learn how. Get back to work right now or you're fired. He's a feisty little peckerwood, ain't he? I'll finish your shoes. Let's go in this place here and have us a drink. No, no drinks. When I drink, I fight. When I fight, I hurt men. So they don't let me drink. I smoke my pipe and keep me away from the cantina. You think I'm not a good fighter? Would have hurt that fellow plenty, you bet. Hey. You chunking clods at my wall? No, sir, I'm a customer. Any of that beer cold? You are funny. Ain't there anybody friendly around here? I'm friendly. What the hell do you want? Well, I want a shot of that mescal and a glass of that hot beer. You just can't help being smart, can you? I couldn't be smart. I can't afford it. A whiskey. Whiskey. God, this place smells worse than a hog rut. -Whiskey. -Any special brand? Yeah, anything you got that ain't burned a hole in the keg. You connected with the factory? Work for the railroad? What are you, a Pinkerton or you just plain nosy? Well, you don't have to get so mad. Now, look, I done stomped one peckerwood today, now I figure I can get one more in before train time. Okay, peckerwood. I'm gonna spread your guts around. That there is murder, mister. Then why don't you call the law? I think I might have killed him. I wouldn't be surprised. We can't have nobody menacing our citizens around here with no shotgun. You seen what he was trying to do, didn't you, Newton? Yes, sir. He was about to shoot this kid. Is that all? I believe that's about as far as he'd thought it out. Well, he ain't gonna shoot nobody else around here today. Come on, give me a hand with him. I certainly appreciate this, Sheriff. Damn you, boy, I knowed you was going to cause me trouble. Make you sick seeing a dead man? I've seen 'em before. Where, in a picture book? Take him over to the undertaker. Tell him compliments of Mean John Simpson. And then keep your butt out of here. This cantina's for men. I think I got the itch. Newton, you got any of that who-hit-John? Yes, sir. Give me a little charge of it. I don't come from around here. No. I don't work in their damn factory. Oh, they can kick me around like a slave boy. And you can't have pride. Those people making you eat cow chips, all day long, for a few nickels. No, sir. I don't eat no cow shit. I ate some one time. Not too bad if you're hungry. If you're not hungry, don't eat cow shit. Do you work around here? Work? You like to work? That's what I've come here to do, to work. Then I'll take you to Preacher Bob. He tries to get us work. Foy. You can have this work if you want it. Boy, that's a humdinger. This machine must make us like the angels. But behold the land is full of bloody crime. The city is full of violence. The worst of the heathen shall possess your house. The pomp of the strong shall cease. Destruction cometh and ye shall seek peace and ye shall find none whatsoever. Welcome, brother. How far do you figure this thing will go off? All I know is destruction is coming! The profane and the unclean shall perish in fire as real as the sun. That's real interesting news. Some find it fascinating. How, uh... How does this...? I call this machine my aero-cycle. How does this machine work? A wood fire heats up this boiler, turns this fan. Then you pedal fast like a bicycle and you will sail away. Keep a grip on the handlebars for steering and balance. It'll set you down as pretty as a bird. Ain't much to it once you know how. Can we take her up? I got a few kinks to iron out yet. It's the engineering marvel of the age. Brother... it's beautiful to be flying. Hey, hey! No! Jesus Christ! I mean, that's one way to go to heaven. Even if I can only get to Austin or Dallas, that wouldn't be too poor a feat now, would it? Preacher Bob. Is you all right? You all right? Yes, sir. Get a chicken. Here's your chicken. Wring its neck. You can start tomorrow. Thank you. You know, I heard a curious story today. First part I heard over at the barbershop, Mrs. Evans. The second part I heard over at the cantina. Thank you. Barber fired you today, boy. Yeah, ain't that amazing, because, uh, Wills, he hired me, I'm gonna start there tomorrow morning. Damn animal, get out of the gravy. That ain't all. This boy killed a man at the cantina today. Simpson done it. You caused it. You attacked that man like some kind of vicious beast. He started it. Maybe so, maybe no. Well, I'll tell you one thing. Sheriff Simpson don't like that boy one bit. I want everybody at this table to hear one thing. I don't like Sheriff Simpson none too much neither. You got no respect, boy. What am I supposed to have respect for? Now I'm warning you, boy. You can't talk to your elders like that. Yeah, well. Here's two things I don't need. This supper... and the warnings from my elders. Excuse me, everyone. That boy should be in the army. What did you say? I said you should be in the army. Maybe it'd teach you some respect. Pass the bread, please. Come in. Hey, Bick. Come on over to our room, have a drink of brandy. No, I don't think so, Reese, thank you. Come on, it's just down the hall. It's not too far to walk. Come on, we'll have a little talk. It'll do you good, come on. I ain't never had no brandy. After standing up in that factory all day long, I like to have a drink of brandy at night. It makes me feel better. Thank you. Howdy. Did you really cause a killing today? Come on now, Molly. He doesn't want to talk about things like that. This is the first exciting thing that's happened since we've been in Dime Box. I feel like I finally met a real westerner. I'd like to have been a dead westerner. Come on, Bick, have some of this brandy. -Sit down. -Yeah, sit down. Well, here's to getting ahead. Far ahead. You got to go easy with that stuff, you know, you just sip it. Phew. I wonder if somebody could write me a letter. -Letter? -I'll do it. Because my penmanship ain't the best. Here, do it over here, Molly. It's this old girlfriend of mine I had up there in Fort Worth. Oh, well, if it's a private matter, I'll clear out for you. Oh, no, it ain't nothing like that. Really, I mean... All right. Lowatha. You just spell it the best way you can. "Dear Lowatha, I never did mean to go wrong." Just put it down like that, she'll know what I mean. How did you go wrong? That's, uh, personal, Molly. Well, let's just get this thing over with. "Say, here, Lowatha, why don't you come on down here to Dime Box, you see how you like it down here. The train, that'd be a... That'd be a good deal for a girl like you, who ain't never been nowhere. You answer this letter damn quick. It's been writ by a married lady... whose husband's my friend." Sign it, from your old amigo Bickford Waner. You know, I love nice things like this. I like having a good friend come over and sit around, drink some brandy and, you know, make civilized talk. I think sometimes I was born in the wrong time. Sometimes I think I was born too poor. Money ain't got nothing to do with it, Bick. Money don't make no difference. You can live a whole beautiful life inside your head. A lot of rich folks, they can't do that. Hell, they wouldn't know a beautiful thing if they was right on top of it. Here it comes, Lowatha. Tall runner. Swift runner. Hmm. Say, do you know anything about the Greeks? I knew old Greek up in Fort Worth that ran the laundry and he had a daughter named Helen. Oh, no, no. I'm talking about the old-timey Greeks. No, I don't know nothing about them. Well, I got a couple of books on the subject if you'd like to read them. Well, I'd rather just hear about it. -Would you? -Yep. Well, they sure knew how to live, those old Greeks. I wouldn't be boring you now, would I? No, it ain't boring to me 'cause, see, I ain't got nobody to tell me nothing and it's interesting to me. Huh. Well, there's one thing. They didn't have a lot of dumb rules like we've got. They wore comfortable clothes, for example. They went around barefooted and with sheets and other comfortable things like that. Best thing I think is what they loved, they loved knowledge, justice. They didn't believe they was ever gonna die. Men could love each other and they didn't have to be ashamed about it. They could say things like... "Well, this is my friend, and I love him." Whereas you can't do that today. Unless maybe it's your daddy or your brother. Mostly we don't even do it then, do we? Well, they had their favorite wives, favorite dog. Of course now, they did have slaves and that was wrong. I admit that, what do you think? Oh, yeah, well, was they niggers? Well, some was, some was from Africa. They had some white slaves. Hmm. They had these beautiful girls. They were slaves. And they had to do anything the men wanted. I ain't never really thought about slaves one way or another. Well, these old timey Greeks, they had slaves for working, they had slaves for fighting. That way they could sit around like we do, drink wine, read books, play games, take baths. That sure is different from what we got going now, ain't it? Yeah, we sure do have to work for a living, that's a fact. Have another brandy. No. I got to get up early in the morning, go to work. Well, sure been pleasant talking with you tonight. Nice talking to you. Hmm. Molly, Bick's going to bed now. Oh, good night, Bick. Good night, ma'am. -Let's do it again. -Let's do it. Hope your girl comes soon. Boy, so do I. Night now. Don't run them chickens in this hot sun, boy! Gonna make them skinny. Yes, sir. Come on here. You sorry little ball of feathers you. Mm-hmm. Goddammit. Dull axe make it hard. There you go. You do have a lively aroma, brother. I would suggest that one aspect of your new employment be an occasional bath. Or else you'll find yourself with no social life whatsoever. What are those pills you keep taking? This is my nerve and brain medicine. Whenever I get to feeling weak, flushy, nervous or just generally sick, I pop one down my throat. The Lord favors those that cure themselves. These do the turn for me. What are they made out of? Oh, I don't know. I order them out of Chicago. I expect they got a dash of cocoa leaf and a dash of opium. I told you never to leave nothing on the runner. My daddy, he knew a boy up there in Fort Worth. And... he'd take a lot of that opium. He got to liking it when a horse throwed him and broke both of his legs. Well, God gave man the poppy and the cocoa plant to use for his benefit. Also hemp and the peyote cactus. Some say they've never seen God quite so clear as when they've been chewing cactus buds. Next, you're gonna be telling me that God gave man beer and whiskey. That He did, brother. That He did. Don't leave out wine. You don't talk like, uh, the way I figured no preacher would talk. Back east, I was an engineer. I had two lovely children and a fine wife, but... beer and whiskey overcame me. When you're young like you, you got confidence and everything is beautiful. When you get older, you realize no matter how you struggle, the Lord God is up yonder waitin' on your restless soul and ain't no way you're going to get out of dying. And you need something all powerful to keep up your spirit. Have you ever been baptized? You mean dunked underwater? You sound scornful of the act. Now, let me tell you this, man's knowledge is very small, life is very great and the mysteries are immense. And the hereafter is profoundly long lasting. Hey! Hey, son of a bitch. When you hear my voice, you grow roots. Now go on home, I just wanted to watch you shiver. -Guess what? -What? We got a surprise for you. -Go on, Molly. -Okay. We couldn't hardly wait till you get home, because that water was just about to get cold. That's a bathtub. Yeah, it ain't a steamboat. Look at that, 6 feet long, all steel, all white lined, nickel plated. Cost $12.29, and that don't include the freight charges. I mean, that's a real neat deal, Reese, that's... Oh, the water is still warm. Let's take a bath. You and me both. How long has it been since you had a bath? A week, uh... More like two weeks. See there, don't claim you don't need one. Now me and Molly, we worked like the dickens, hauling this hot water up here and we ain't gonna waste it on just one person. Come on. I'll turn my back. This is the way the old time Greeks did it, come on. Well, I mean, they had a bigger tub, huh? No, it's the biggest one I... Oh, you mean the Greeks? Well, yeah, I suppose so but what the hell, you and me, we can fit in here, can't we? Go on, take your clothes off. Ah! -Soap. -Get your... Move your foot back a little bit. Hoo-yeah. Ooh. Oh. Oh, boy, it's pretty good, huh? This beats a lot of things. Hey, no peeing in the water. All right? All right, Molly, come on. We're ready. Come on. Come on wash my back. Here, soap up my back a little bit, honey. Good? My goodness, will you look at that water? It's already turning black. She ain't even started on you yet. Oh, no, she can... Skip me. Oh, no. No, you need it. Are you sure this is the way the Greeks did it, huh? Well, it was... it was something like this, I imagine, uh-huh. And what'd they do afterwards? Well, they just kind of laid around, drink wine, one thing and another. There's no wonder everybody heard about them, huh? I got soap in my eye. Well, it's probably just as well, because, you know, the color of this water, it looks like the Brazos River right after a spring rain. Molly, I've got soap in my eyes. Will you just... Now wait a minute. What are we gonna do with this dirty water? I got it. What are you gonna do with an enema? You just hold on to this. All right. And you hold on to this. Come here with me. Come on. Come on over here. You put that in that water. -Put it in there. -All right You're gonna make a siphon. Let me see here. A teeny-weeny five. What a pretty little foot. I bet this'll fit you just as... Oh. Oh. Who is it? Mrs. Evans, open the door. Well, we ain't decent. I should say you're not. Can't you go outdoors like everybody else? What'd you say, Mrs. Evans? I said what have you got in there, a horse? Oh, Bickford Waner, ma'am. Howdy, how are you doing? Nighty night now. Well, good night. Oh. Recognize them chickens, I guess. Yeah, I reckon. I plucked them. Well, you ain't gonna pluck no more of them. How come? Nobody's buying any plucked chickens no more. Be layin' me off then, huh? I just don't need a chicken plucker. All right, then I'll just draw up my time. I ain't got no money. You owe me at least $4 for this. You can't get blood out of a stone, I reckon. Sorry. Hey, mister, sorry ain't gonna cut it. Now wait... What... Hey! I want to get paid. Do you understand that? Hey, you stole them chickens. You ask Wills if I did. They're all plucked. Well, these here hands plucked them, mister. Well, uh, you just cover them up. This here is a decent town. -Thank you. -That's better. Hi. This here is for you. This is for me. Lowatha, huh? Lowatha. Would you read it to me? I'd like to see what that old gal's got to say for herself. Oh, maybe you should read it yourself. It might be awful personal. I'd get the words wrong. All right. "Dear Bick, I don't want to go to Dime Box. I like it in Fort Worth real good. I have been on the train several times. I have a boyfriend. Mama and Daddy are fine. They tell you hello and keep away from here. The Dawsons have electric lights now. Goodbye. Your friend, Lowatha." Let me see that a minute. I don't believe that. Damn her sorry soul. Why would she give me an answer like that? I mean, that girl and I were like a couple of pigeons. All women so damn sorry? No. You can find a nice girl, Bick. Where at? You're looking at one. Don't you be funnin' around with me now. Why do you always think I'm funnin'? Molly, this ain't right. Oh, my God. Reese. It's got nothing to do with Reese. Just between us. No. You know, people get killed doing these kind of things. It's worth it. Look, I'm trying to be... Trying to be what? I don't love you. I never mentioned love, did I? No. No, you didn't. What's this that I hear about you getting up early and going to church? Ain't that kind of peculiar? Well, I went up there to see Preacher Bob. Mm-hmm. Is there something wrong? I mean, I get the idea that you're mad at me. You ain't been down to dinner for 3 or 4 days. You ain't been over for your bath. Listen, if you're in trouble, there ain't nothing in the world that me and Molly wouldn't do for you, you know that, don't you? Well, a man's got to kill his own snakes. Does it got anything to do with what Molly was telling me? What did she tell you? Well, I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up. No, what did she say to you? Oh, it's about your girlfriend in Fort Worth. Oh, yeah, well... it's got something to do with that, all right. Let me tell you something, Bick. If I was you, I wouldn't get married. Molly's a fine woman and I love her to death. But there's times I wish I was rid of her. And there's times when I look at her and I know that if anything came between us, I don't know what the hell I'd do. Then I think maybe if I'd never met her, I'd never gotten married at all. It's not like two men can be friends, you know what I mean? It's not like the way two men can be friends. Looks like those damn dogs got something. Yeah, I think they're onto something. Let's go. And Hezekiah said, "This is a day of trouble." - Yeah. - "This is a day of rebuke." - Yeah. - "This is a day of blasphemy!" Amen. "And I will send a blast upon the kings." - Hallelujah. - "And I will deliver my people into their own land." - Hallelujah. - Now you must believe. I believe. - Say yes. - Yes! - Say, "I believe!" - I believe! Say, "I trust you, Jesus!" I trust you, Jesus! - I trust you, Jesus. - I trust you, Jesus. Now when they came to the Lord Jesus Christ and demanded a sign, he said unto them, "O ye hypocrites, ye can discern on the face of the sky, but you cannot see the signs of the times!" Say, "Oh, yes, Lord Jesus, I believe you, Lord!" Yes, Lord Jesus, I believe you, Lord. - I believe you, Lord. - I believe you, Lord. Have you got God in your heart, boy? Yes, my boy has got God in his heart! He's got God in his heart! Amen! Amen! That's my little boy! Don't let your heart be sickened with this modern strife. You give your soul to the Lord Jesus Christ. I love You, Jesus. See here, my friends, how Jesus can touch the heart of this heathen. Red and yellow, black and white, it's all the same to Jesus! Here. A good lady of Dime Box baked this for me. She don't want to see skinny preachers. When are you gonna push me under the water? You mean baptize? Oh, pretty soon, pretty soon. -Want some cake? -No, thank you. You been taking many others ahead of me. When you do me? I said pretty soon. You do me with the little boy from tonight, do you? What's the rush? You say when we get pushed under the water, our spirits will be saved forever. We're childrens of God. Well, that's the teaching. Yeah, and the children of God, they get their lands back? Well, I didn't exactly say that. You said that this man, God... Wait a minute, Mendoza, God ain't a man. But Jesus is his son. Well, it's a tricky situation. You push Old Coyote under the water real soon, and then he'll get our lands back. And we'll have a place to live. It's more complicated than that. Wait. No, you been lying about God. Now you hold on, boy. I never lied about no God. Then push me under the water. All right, then. The next time we go out, you go in. I'm down to the factory tomorrow to see Hendricks. Reese set it up for me. You ain't overwhelmed with excitement. No. There's something ain't quite manly about making small bowls for people that you ain't even ever gonna see. Yeah, everybody has to do things they don't always like. Yeah. Well, I guess the factory is the last chance around here for me. America has got places to go! And the Great American Ceramic Novelty Company is going with it. We're a great republic. The greatest there is or ever was. And we've got work for our people everywhere. But you come along down here to the main floor and let me show you something. Right here in Dime Box, we've got the requisite materials to produce crockery so superior in body and in glaze and design that in five years time, England will give clean up and say, "America, you win!" Whoa. Practically, all it takes is body heat to turn the clay of Dime Box into crockery, that Queen Victoria of England would be proud to eat her biscuits off of. So the US of A has got possessions all over the world. Giddyup. But it's right here in Dime Box that the name crockery is going to take on a new meaning and you, Waner, are going to be a vital member of that family. Welcome! Howdy. Boy. There must be a better job around here than this. Depends on what you call better. Anything that don't require sweating and shoveling all this coal, that's better, mister. Then there's better. What's... what's the best? Oh, Mr. Hendricks' job is the best. That there's the job I want. Then you better take your pistol. Well, now couldn't he just adopt me as his son or something? Trip down the stairs one day, fall on his stick and break it? Now I say come down here, son. It ain't that cold and it ain't deep enough to scare you. Preacher Bob, I just can't see lettin' my little boy being baptized in the water with them Injuns. I don't think that God would have wanted it that way. Well, I'm the one who knows what God wants. Who the devil are you to tell a preacher about God? Now I say to you again, send that boy down here right now! All right. All right then. It's no skin off my butt if your child burns in hell. Sorry, Jesus. Baptists, you get three of them together, you get three theologians. Come on down here, brother. Kneel. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Hyah, come on. Get that Indian out of the white man's water, Preacher. You are interfering with God's business! You ain't gonna baptize no Indian in white man's water. Wait a second, Sheriff. This here ain't necessarily white man's water. Well, it looks like it to me. Well, it ain't. And it's flowing down the stream that way. You see, you can here baptize this Injun, take him out, put a white man right in the same water, 'cause it's all flowing downstream here. That's right. He's done baptized anyway! Well, now if his soul is saved, maybe I better just send him on to heaven. Shoot me then! Go ahead, shoot! I'm not afraid. How about you? Are you afraid? Oh, yes, sir. I'm afraid. But you see... I ain't ever been baptized. Well, now if I was the rest of you folks, I'd wait a long time for this water to run downstream, so's you don't get none of it on you. Hyah, hyah. Hyah. Listen, listen, everybody! Now this is Thanksgiving, and our family here has a lot to be thankful for. Remember, the Lord helps him who helps himself. So come on, everybody, let's eat! I looked for you this morning. I had to go down to the drugstore. But the drugstore is closed on Thanksgiving. How am I supposed to know that? You're just using me like a piece of meat. I ain't even using you. Bick, don't treat me like this, I can't stand it. Dessert? Well, what have you two been talking about? Whoa. Bick? Bickford Waner. Bickford, you son of a bitch! Janet? Ha ha. Honey, it's me. Look at you. Oh, honey, I thought you'd be in jail by now. I thought you'd be shot to pieces. -Would you join us? -Oh, thank you. Oh, this is Janet Conforto. This here is Reese and Molly Ford. -Nice to meet you. -How do you do? -Nice to meet you, ma'am. -Pleasure. Thank you. Janet's... an actress. Is that very dangerous? Oh, it has its moments, honey. I didn't know that actresses got shot to pieces, never heard of that. Goddamn, I could tell you stories make your hair stand on end. Worse things than that can happen to actresses. One night I was opening in 'Frisco playing Cassandra... I didn't know that there was a theatrical company in Dime Box now. God bless your soul, honey. I came here to do a single. I heard there was new money in town, I said to myself, "Janet, they need some entertainment there." Money. Guess that's what brought you here, too, eh, Kid? Kid Blue in the very flesh. I swear, honey, I thought you'd be caught and hanged by now. What is this, uh, Kid Blue? It's a nickname I had up there in Fort Worth. Reese, it don't mean nothing. Seems to me that there was a train robber sometime back called Kid Blue. Oh, that's nothing. Fella... That fella got nothing to do with me. Hell no. Uh, I'm too full for dessert. Take Miss Conforto back into town. Yeah, sure. I'm staying at the hotel. Till I get established elsewhere. That's where I'll take you then. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Now you take care of yourself, honey, you're looking a little peaked there. Bye-bye, all. Bye. -Howdy, Sheriff. -Howdy. That is the sheriff. Got it. Kid Blue, huh? Bickford, my boy. Happy Thanksgiving. Who is that? That there is the man that owns that factory. Happy Thanksgiving. Thought I smelled a leading citizen. Oh, yeah. Hyah. Howdy. Hey, you didn't come home last night. No. I was... You know, I'd really appreciate it if... you know what Janet said about Kid what's-his-name, if you never said nothing about that to nobody. Oh, no, I won't say nothing. I'm just curious. Hell, Molly, she's clean ate up with it. Are you the Kid Blue, huh? I've always known that there was something different about you. Some quality, I don't know... Dangerous maybe, hmm? Who'd ever thought that I was gonna be a friend of Kid Blue? -Yes, sir? -Oh, no. I was... I'm waiting for a friend. Excuse me. I've been watching you, boy. I couldn't help but notice that. What do you think you're up to with this woman? She's just an old girlfriend of mine from back home. Howdy. Oh, howdy, ma'am. Who's your handsome friend? I'm Sheriff Mean John Simpson, ma'am. Now why would anyone call you Mean? To them folks that I like I can be a real nice person. To them that I don't like, they'd rather fall in a cactus patch than to see me get stirred up. That's the truth, ma'am. Well, I intend to see that you like me, Mean John. Well, thank you, ma'am, I already do. You sure do smell good. Thanks. Sheriff. Why do you flirt with a bastard like that? I mean he is plum nasty. Oh, come on. You know a lady's life ain't as simple as a man's. Well, I can't go nowhere tonight, I got to go to work tomorrow. Damn, I hate to be lonely but then, a lady never knows what might turn up. I think you got a partner. I think I do. Afternoon, Sheriff. Afternoon. Bye-bye, honey. Would the great Kid Blue protect me if I was in trouble? Molly, candy? Thank you. -Waner? -Oh, no, thank you, ma'am. No? Oh, Mrs. Evans, could I ask you a question in secrecy? Of course. No, no, Bick, you can stay. You're a close friend. I know you wouldn't betray a confidence. Mrs. Evans, how does a girl tell if she's going to have a baby? Well, you get sick in the mornings, and feel kind of odd and... your monthly juices stops. Think that fits you? Could be. But please don't tell Reese yet. I don't want him to get excited until I'm absolutely sure. You promise, Bick? Couldn't beat it out of me with a ball bat. If you're looking for Bick, he's not here. Oh, honey, I'm just here to buy some boots at wholesale prices. Never pay retail if I can help it. Have you known him for long? That shoe salesman? You know who I mean. Yeah, I know who you mean. You got signal flags sticking out of every hole when Bick's around. No more than you do. Want to fight? Let's have a fight. Come on, let's have a good fight. Come on. I'm not a brawler, but I warn you, when I want something, I am very determined. Wait a minute, honey. Wait a minute. Think I better straighten you out on a few things. I know Bickford Waner back in Fort Worth, when he still had a mama and a papa. That was a long time ago. I'm the one who introduced Bick to certain pleasures. And I always liked him. But Bick and I are both outlaws and an outlaw's life can change all of a sudden. I wouldn't put my tattoo on him even if he wanted me to. Bick's not an outlaw anymore. Oh, honey. Damn it, you can dress him up in any kind of fancy suit you like, but it's still Kid Blue looking out of them eyes. Your head is so full of romance, you don't even have no room for the truth in there. The truth is Bick likes me better than he likes you. Couldn't possibly. The fact is, honey, I'm better company. Ah, shoe salesman, I want me some boots. Now why don't we go to my hotel and count toes? Well, as a matter of fact, ma'am... I only deal in straight forward cash business. Hell, yes, that's the only kind I understand. Hi, Reese. Molly always did think outlaws were romantic. Can I tell you something? All the things that I stole... wouldn't make a pile big enough that would stop a midget from jumping over it. Outlaw glory. You seduced my wife with it. No, I didn't. Are you saying... Are you saying that she seduced you? I did it. Yeah. Well, that's noble of you. No, it ain't noble of me. But it's as much your fault, and you listen to me now... as mine. You know that we were together there taking a bath with her in the room? I mean, what do you expect? You were my friend. I am your friend. That's a damn lie. No, it ain't. It's the absolute truth. And if I could take it all back... I would. Where'd you do it to her? Stood out in the woods like a damn dog? Were you in my room, in my bed? Don't you see that my insides are coming apart? Oh, God. Do you love her? Well, you and her were the only people I loved in the world. I am truly sorry, and I'm gonna be leaving town. No, you're not gonna go no place. Are you going to use that? I got to. Please don't. You fool! You damn fool! I'm your friend! I'm just no man at all. Just no man at all. - Stay back. - Don't touch me. What happened? What happened, Reese? Ohh! Oh! This is a scandal, Waner. I am deeply, deeply disturbed, and ashamed for all the fine people in our family here. And I should think you would feel humiliated. Well? Mr. Hendricks said, "Well." It weren't no good at all what happened. The fact that your friend disappeared in the middle of the night proves he is demented in some fashion, even though he has been so cruelly treated by his best friend and his own wife. But the fact that Reese Ford has a mental aberration of some kind does not lessen your guilt one bit, Waner. No, it don't, sir. I ought to fire you right now. Yes, sir, all right. But getting off would be too good for you. Starting this afternoon, you go back to work in the kiln. And you can stay there until I feel you have seen your error. Go on. Tell Mr. Hendricks thank you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. John, on your way out, would you send in Mr. Forest? Yes, sir. Mr. Hendricks would like to see you. Yes, sir. Your lady friend's been showing me a real fine time. Your lady friend from back home, that is. I'm entrusting you to the Christmas payroll. Was you confused for a minute? No. You wait a minute! You've been walking on a mighty thin line. And one small slip and your ass is dust. You understand that? -Yes, sir. -Well, you better. Yes, sir. The Great American Ceramic Novelty Company. Well, they got a payroll over there for Christmas. Jesus, I love you. Listen to me. We can get that money. It would be just like the old days. We could get it. No, they'll catch our ass now. We can get that money. If you listen to me, I mean it, we can get it. We can get that payroll. Look, I don't know nothing about Jesus. But I know He... He'd want us to have it. Are you with me on this? Amen. -Amen. -Amen. All we need are guns and horses. -Amen. -Amen. Amen. Pretty. All in all, Bickford, I'm glad I know you. We're closed. Yes, sir. I know that. Mr. Hendricks sent me up here. He wants me to take some of those Santa Claus ashtrays down there to the church to give out as gifts. Bickford. All right. Yes, sir. Thank you. Real quiet, mister. Shh. Real quiet. Mr. Forest upstairs? Well, we're gonna go wish him a merry Christmas. And you better do it real straight, mister. Understand? You say hello to Mr. Forest. -Go. -Mr. Forest? -Yeah? -It's me. Right there. You hold it right there. What the hell, Bickford! Forest, you just take your gun, you put it on the desk. The key. The key! Stay down! Stay down there! Them three Indians, sir, they're in the factory there. They're up to no good. -I'll check on 'em. -Sir. Where's my horse? Where is he? Where's my damn horse? Where is it? Go get some men and some guns. Go on! Hurry up! That's it, bring it right over here now. Get on. Bring her by now, I'll get right on the back. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! I got the money! Get on. Ignorant savage. Let's go find the money. Preacher Bob! Preacher Bob! Sit down and use some of God's air, brother. I'll make some coffee. I ain't got any time. Listen, I'm gonna take a trip in this aero-cycle. Well, I'm not all that sure it's ready yet. It'll fly, won't it? Well, I believe so, brother, but believing ain't the same. Well, mister, fire it up. Well, it's gonna take time to get enough air. Maybe we could chop some more wood here. We'll go with what we've got. Look... I should tighten the struts and then I should check the steering and then I should work on the linkage back here. Look, Preacher Bob, I'm taking this aero-cycle all the way to Dallas. Come on! Up the hill! After him! How you doing? It's all fired up. Okay, let's get going. -What you got in that box? -Money. Help me. Our Father who art in heaven... Not that way, push, man! Push! Hey! Whoa! That way to Dallas! Pedal! I thought we had it there for a minute. Come on, men! Oh, God, we thank You for these bad shots. Run, Bick! Run, boy! Run with Jesus, Bick. Shoot that peckerwood, Sheriff.
