My name is Mordecai. I'm a soul collector. Since the beginning of time, we have guided souls into the afterlife, arriving at the moment of death in accordance with the grand design. [flatlining] [sad music playing] [man] I'm sorry. He's gone. No, no! No. [indistinct chatter] [Mordecai] There have been few problems. After all, one should not stumble while on the eternal path. Come on, hot shooter! [Mordecai] But recently, the council has been confronted by an errant spirit, who has become, in this century's vernacular, a screwup. Yes! Yes! [pager beeping] [woman crying] [flatlining] [beeping] -[man] We've got rhythm back. -Oh, my God, Raymond. Oh, thank God. I'm on a roll. All right, ten on number nine. Come on, baby, do your thing. Do your thing, do your thing. [dealer] Seven. That's a loser. Next shooter. Place your bets, please. You blew it. Hey. Stick around, Mordecai, you might bring me some luck. Zacariah, you had a collection scheduled, and you weren't even there. Five minutes! No, no. You pushed it too far. They are angry, Zacariah, and I'm not gonna cover for you any more. Just tell them to reschedule. They've done it before. That is not the point. Every time you get involved in one of these cockamamie stunts of yours, the plan is altered. Years of human life are affected. You're a soul collector. You have a job to do. All right, I won't screw up again. Just... You got my promise. Promises won't cut it. Not any more. Well, what do you want from me? It's not what I want, Zacariah. It's out of my hands now. You've gone too far, and this time, they're gonna teach you a lesson. No, no lessons. Look, talk to them for me one more time. I can't. It's final. Besides, I agree with them. Thirty days on Earth, living as a human being. Maybe then you'll learn some compassion for them. [chuckling] No. You're kidding. [chuckling] [dazed music playing] [birds chirping] [Zacariah chuckles] You got to be kidding me. I mean, live as a human? This is insane. I... I mean, yeah, I was a little late. It's not like... Like it hasn't happened before. Give me a break. Zacariah, you're arrogant, you're irresponsible. You think you can get away with everything. Well, you've used up your last marker. The answer is no. So, what am I supposed to do here? How do you expect me to live? I suggest you get a job. [instrumental music playing] [music continues playing] [cow mooing] It's all right. It's okay. There you go. Oh, you're just caught up. Ow, ow! [mooing] There you go. Stand up. Stand... You all right? Okay. Go on. [moos] [gun cocks] Who the hell are you, and what are you doing on my property? I'm waiting for an answer. Come on. My name's Zac... Zacariah. That doesn't tell me what you're doing with my cattle. I was getting it out of that, that wire. Where's your horse? I don't know. I'd tell you more if I knew more. Well, you better tell me something. I was riding. And the horse got spooked and... Threw me. You know, when I came to, it was gone. Everything I had went with it. That's your story? Yeah. Yeah, that's as much of it as I can remember. Oh, so now you have amnesia, too? Well, I don't know about amnesia but, uh... I can't remember yesterday. I wouldn't accept that story from my seven-year-old son. Now, you just go on. Get out of here. Ow! [Rebecca] What is it? Blood. Blood? Ooh, that looks bad. Really? Yeah, here. Thank you. Okay. Hey. [chuckling] Well, you're not just gonna leave me here, are you? I guess my calf owes you more than that. Come on. Hop on. Go on. [grunting] Whoa, hey! Whoa. [grunting] Hey! Are you okay? Yeah? Yeah. Sure? Yeah. I can see why you fell off your horse. Let's go. Hang on. [country music playing] [grunting] Hey, Jason, would you take... Whoa. Careful. -Jason, would you take him, please? -Hi, mom! Hey, Danny, did you get your work done? Uh, most of it. [sneezes] Gesundheit. I sneezed. Why is that a big deal? Who's he? His name is Zac. He helped me with a calf over in the north pasture. What was he doing there? I, uh, I fell off my horse, and your mom rescued me. Surprised she didn't shoot you. [chuckles] Well, I think she meant to. That's my mom. All right. It's enough of this. I want you to go get cleaned up, okay? But what about him? His shirt's all ripped and he's wet and dirty. He'd fit into dad's things. That'd be good. Yeah, uh, okay. Why don't you go upstairs and get him a pair of pants and a shirt? You know where your dad's stuff is packed away, right? Okay, hurry up. Thanks. Um... Head for this way, please. Helen, this is Zac. I found him wrestling a calf out of a mudhole over in the north pasture. Looks like the calf won. No. Well, how about some coffee? Coffee. Just made some fresh. How do you take it? Take it. Uh... Cream, sugar? He claims that his memory is gone. Well. Let's try black. That's coffee. Something wrong with it? I just did not think it would ta-- No, it's good. There's cream and sugar's over there. Might want to try that. You know, you probably want to go... The bathroom's just across the hall there to clean up. What's that all about? You keep an eye on him. I'm gonna go check him out. [slow piano music playing] [Rebecca] Come on, sheriff, somebody must have reported him missing. -Uh-huh. -Mom? Hold on one second. Think these will fit? Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I'm here. Well, just keep checking, okay? [whistling] Those clothes look like they fit you pretty good. Uh, yep. Yep. Yeah. Thank you. Yours will be done in just a minute. Aw, mom, isn't he staying for dinner? Uh, he can't. There's people that will be missing him. Uh... Danny, why don't you go set another place at the table? Yes! [Jake] Rebecca, we've been all over this place and there's nothing out there. Did you look in Little Rock Canyon? We looked everywhere. I've got more bad news. There's another 50 head missing. Fifity more? [Charlie] We'll find them, Miss Rebecca. They're out there somewhere. Isn't it time for some of uncle Charlie's birthday cake? -Who told? -[all laughing] Oh, come on, Uncle Charlie, you've been talking about that cake all week. Your mama's been cooking me carrot cake since she was ten years old, and it's still the best I ever ate. Oh, you just say that so I'll keep making them for you every year. Oh, no, he's saying it to warn me not to even try. [laughing] Mom swore never to go near the kitchen. [mimics chocking] [all laughing] See how they beg for my cooking? * For he's A jolly good fellow* * For he's A jolly good fellow* * For he's A jolly good fellow* * Which nobody can deny* Make a wish. Ow! [laughing] Don't ever do that. It hurts. No kidding. -Come on! -Come on! Zac? Where was it you said you were from again? I told you I don't know. Yeah. You said you got thrown off a horse. You look familiar. Did we ever meet before? I don't think so. No, if he was from around here, one of us would know him. Then maybe you could tell us where you think you might be headed. Well, I guess I'm looking for a job. [Danny] You could work here. No, we don't... We don't need another man around here. But you said yesterday we could use some more help. [man] Would you work for room and board? I don't know. What kind of work? We could use somebody to finish up the property fence. How long would that take? Two weeks, maybe a month. I could do that. Yeah, I mean, how hard could it be? [laughing] All right. So how many cattle do you think are missing at this point? Couple hundred, maybe 300. Well, we just can't afford to lose any more, not with the price of beef as low as it is. We just got to get lucky. We needed luck yesterday. You all know how much acreage we had to sell off last year. We could barely afford winter feed. Well, that's exactly why the last thing we need's another mouth to feed. No, Jake, that last thing we need to do is fall behind on work while we're looking for cattle. That's why he can help us, Rebecca. Well, I talked with the other ranchers again today, and no one's missing any livestock. Sheriff can't figure it out, either. [door opens] Dad, you said after dinner. Checkers, Charlie. We promised. [giggles] We'll talk. -Good night. -Thanks. Look, I don't trust this guy. I think it's odd that he shows up here now, right when you're losing all the cattle. The cattle started disappearing weeks ago. Well, maybe he came here to finish things off. It's a pretty strange way to go about it. I'm not gonna leave him here with you and Danny alone. I can take care of myself. I know that. But I want to take care of you. Thanks for cleaning up. Sure. Ellie, come on. Time to go. [Ellie] I'll be right down. You okay? Maybe he shouldn't be staying here. There's something strange about him. Honey, you're the one that brought him home, fed him dinner. What was I supposed to do? He was all muddy, cut, bleeding... Okay, so now he's dry and bandaged... And settled in the bunkhouse. What am I doing? Danny seems to like him. Danny misses his father. Hey, it's every woman's dream, right? Having a handsome stranger show up at your door? You have been reading way too many romance novels. With my luck, someone's gonna show up at my door with a warrant for his arrest. Say goodbye to your Aunt Bec. -Bye, Rebecca. -Bye, sweetie. Sleep tight. -Night. -Night. [snoring] [mumbling] This is great. This is great. Mordecai, what am I doing here? [rooster crows] So, Zac. How did you sleep last night, partner? Not the way I'd hoped. [chuckling] Well, don't complain to me about being tired. -I expect a fair day's work out you. -Ow! You know what it is you got to do? Yeah, I'll figure it out. You better do more than figure it out. Maybe he ought to ride with me today. Help out with the roundup. Uh-uh. Tom's the foreman. He wants him here finishing the fence. Well... I'd rather he be where I can keep an eye on him. He wouldn't mind you so much if you were old and tired like me. He's a little high-strung. -[barking] -[Danny] Lucky. Lucky, wait up. Lucky. Hey, Zac, what's up? Nothing, I'm just working on... Just putting this fence up. Oh! Ow! Ow, ow! I could have told you that was gonna hurt. You were holding it wrong. [groaning] That's funny? Yeah. Yeah, well, if it's so easy, why don't you try it? -Okay. -Ow! First, you hold the staple underneath like this. Then you tap it. Not too hard. Till it catches. Then you can whack away at it. How come you didn't know that? I knew that. Try it. [Danny] You're doing good. Want some licorice? Sure, thanks. Thanks. [horse whinnying] That's my mom's horse. My dad gave it to her when they got married. She's pretty. She's gonna foal soon. I'm gonna get to train a colt. Oh, yeah? Boy or girl? We don't know that yet. My dad tore this when we were picking apples. Remember much about your dad? I remember some. Mom tells me about him so I don't forget. How did he die? There was a stampede over in Pine Creek Canyon. I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get us some food. [Danny] Come on, Lucky, let's go! It's about time. How are you adjusting to life as a human, Zacariah? Well, it's not as much fun as it looks. The sun's frying my skin, These guys make noises all night, I can't sleep, I mean... Why would anyone want to live like this? Look what's happening to me. The cut went away. The thumb is not healing itself. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Okay, Mordecai, I'm begging you, -get me out of here. -I'm sorry, it's 30 days. You still have 29 to go. That's impossible. Oh, I don't think so. But, Zac, one more thing, when you come back, you'll be bringing something. What? One of these souls. [sad instrumental music playing] [pleasant music playing] Come on, Lucky! Come on, boy! Good boy, Lucky. [Danny] Hi, mom! Hi, sweetie. You didn't have to do this. I'm fine. Ellie said you didn't get out of bed all morning. And besides, I had the soup. I know. I made it yesterday. Of course you did. If I had made the soup, it would really make you sick. Flowers, too. I must be dying. Don't joke. What did the doctor say? I didn't call him. There's nothing wrong. Don't tell me that. This is what, the third time in a month? I'm just tired. I'm not sleeping great. That's all. [Lucky barking] [Danny] Sit. Go get it! Run, boy. How long's he staying? Till he finishes the fence. Jake says he's not much of a worker. Jake would. Hmm. [Danny] Looks like there's something in his paw. Come here. Come here, Lucky. Come here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He's good with kids and dogs. There you go. So, what are you thinking? He can paint a fence, he's nice to dogs. "This is a man I need." He is the last thing I need. Yeah, well, just remember that. Besides, why would I want anybody who doesn't even remember who he is? Right. You keep pushing Jake away because you're not ready. I like Jake, but... Liking is different than loving. [Zacariah] Sit, sit. [Danny] Stay. Go! So, exactly how long do you think we have? Four months. Six at the most. Look, this is gonna sound a little off the wall, but remember when your dad died and old man Peterson tried to buy this property? I don't think he'd resort to rustling. No, that's pretty extreme, even for him. Well, he got the Martel ranch a few years back. And from what I hear, there was some pretty shady stuff connected to it. [sighs] Rebecca, I'll do everything I can to keep you from losing this property. I promise. I know. I miss Sam. I miss him, too. You and Sam. Helen and I had our sights set on you two in fourth grade. How could you resist? We were some pretty hot-looking studs in those boy scout uniforms. Oh, yeah. It was the little cap thing that got to me. [both laughing] [Danny] Tell it again, tell it again! [Zacariah] I can't. Come on. Yeah! Well, each driver was put in a cart that came with two huge wooden wheels. They go racing around the track, and the dust is flying up everywhere, and the horses are thundering, and the people would be standing up, and they're cheering. It's life and death. I want to go! When can we go? Well, you can't go any more. The chariot races were in ancient Rome. It was thousands of years ago. [truck door closes] [Ellie] But you said you were watching from the stands. No, I said that I dreamed that I was watching. Mm-mm. [Jake] Hey. [both] Hey, Jake. Hey, guys. Hi, honey. [knocking] -Hey. -Hi. Movie starts at 8:00. We're gonna be late. I can't go. We got to finish this. How's it looking, Tom? Not great. You know, we can skip the movie. Why don't I go pick us up a quart of Rocky Road ice cream? How'd that be? That sounds great. I'll be back. Okay. [Rebecca chuckling] So, tomorrow you can work on the fence again with Zac. Zac's not much of a builder, mom. I had to show him how to hammer a nail. Well, he's trying to figure out who he is. I guess we can scratch carpenter right off the list, huh? Oh, yeah. Go to sleep, okay? -Good night. -Good night. -You ready? Swear? -Swear. -Swear? -Swear. Pinkie. Aah, love you. Love you, too. Zac said he'd say good night. Well, he went back to the bunkhouse. Um, come on in. Hi. Hi, Zac. Uh... Well, thanks, uh, for helping me today. That was good. You're welcome. Can you tell me a story? And Doc Holliday just swaggered down the street, and he walked in that O.K. Corral and fwoo fwoo! You could hear the whole town just suck in their breath. You said you'd check. I thought you were asleep. Nothing. Night, Danny. Um, I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. What did you find? Nothing, again. You know, whoever's doing this is pretty clever. He seems to know exactly where we're not gonna be. Mm-hmm. I want to look up near where Peterson's ranch starts, All right? Let's head over that way. Hell, Tom, we'll be out all night. You got it. I feel like everything's slowly slipping away. Tell me what to do, Sam. [Ellie] Rebecca! How do I find a way to save us? Rebecca! Rebecca, mama's sick! She fell down and they can't get her up! Where? She's at home. Hang on. [engine turns over] She's over here. Oh, my God. Okay, um, I want you to go and find Zac, okay? You try the bunkhouse first. Is she gonna be okay? Yeah, she's gonna be fine. Now go. Go! Helen? Helen? Helen. Helen, wake up. Come on, wake up. You focus on me, okay? Focus on me. Tom. Where's Tom? He's with Jake and Charlie, okay? We're gonna get you to the hospital. I just want you to stay focused on me, Helen. Look at me. That's good. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Just breathe. [slow music playing] [Zacariah] Did you reach Tom yet? [Rebecca] No, his cellphone must not be working. Sure hope she'll be all right. [engine stops] Rebecca? You all right? This land has been in my family for generations. The people who live on it are my whole life. My father and Helen's father worked on it together. Helen and I grew up playing on every inch of it. Just like Danny and Ellie. I love her, Zac. Let's go. [engine turns over] [horse whinnying] [door opens] Zac! Zac! Zac! The guys aren't back yet. I need your help in the barn. Easy. You're okay. [door opens] Shh, shh. The foal's not coming, and the vet is at another ranch. I need you to come here and hold her head and talk to her. I have to go turn the foal. -What should I do? -Come this way. Easy, easy. Easy, easy. Just keep talking to her. Just hold this. Hold this and just keep talking to her. Okay, okay. Easy. Easy. Keep talking to her. Talk to her. Talk to her. It's okay. Keep talking to her. Easy. Easy, easy. Easy. Okay, I'm gonna try and turn it now. It's okay. Okay. [neighing] Take it easy. I got it. I got it. Okay. I turned it. It's coming. Here it comes, Zac. You want to see this? Come here. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. [neighing] Hey. Thank you. You're welcome. -What do say, cowboy? -Hey. When you finish here, head on over to the horse corral. The gate down there needs a fixing. Okay. You remember anything yet? No. [chuckling] How long you planning on sticking around? Just as long as it takes to fix the fence. [chuckling] Nice job. Thanks. I'm learning all kinds of new things. Can never tell when they're gonna need a fence up there. Things are getting very complicated here. They're not buying my story. I mean, didn't anybody think how this is gonna affect all these lives? They expected you to be an observer, Not a participant. It doesn't work that way. You can't just... You can't just drop into their lives and then expect it to all go back the way it was when you leave, and so I have to assume it's part of their plan. It's not. Zacariah, while you're here, just don't... Screw up. So, part of this lesson in compassion is learning how to lie convincingly? [Zacariah] You talk with your mom about him? [Danny] Yeah, sometimes. Ellie asked if I can still remember what my dad looked like, if I could still hear his voice. Do you? I try to, but not really. But don't tell my mom because it'll make her sad. I worry. He was scared. Why? What happened? Uncle Charlie said they came down the canyon so fast that my daddy couldn't get out of the way. Hyah! [horse whinnying] [Danny] His cinch broke and he fell right in the middle of everything. [Charlie] Sam! Uncle Charlie fell off his horse trying to get to my dad and almost died. He still won't go back to Pine Creek Canyon. Think it hurts to die, Zac? Well, I think the moment that you actually die is... Is wondrous. It's amazingly peaceful. He's in a beautiful place, Danny. I can promise you that. Really beautiful. Helen? What did the doctor say? It's back. Five years. I was almost out of the woods. You beat it before, you'll do it again. I hope so. You will. [sad music playing] She doesn't deserve this. It's so unfair. What's happened? The cancer is back. God. Why is this happening to her? She's done nothing in this life but be a good person. Good night. He's, uh... Fast asleep. Thanks. Sure. There's something about the nighttime. I don't know if it's the stillness of the sky or the way the moon and the stars just seem to hang up there. I feel like I'm looking straight up into heaven. * If I held you forever It wouldn't be enough* * So I'll kiss you And hold you tonight* * If I loved you forever That's not time enough* * So I'll love you The rest of my life* * Hold me tightly...* There's something I've always wanted to do. * Love's brilliant bouquet* * Time passes You and me dancing* * Nothing can stand In our way* * How can I tell you* * Words can't express * * This magic That's happened to me* * Never knew someone Could touch me like this* * Beautiful, gentle And sweet* * If I held you forever It wouldn't be enough* * So I'll kiss you And hold you tonight* * If I loved you forever That's not time enough* * So I'll love you The rest of my life* * Hold me tightly Stand close beside me* * Love's brilliant bouquet* * Time passing You and me dancing* * Nothing can stand In our way* * If I loved you forever That's not time enough* * So I'll love you The rest of my life* I want that guy out of here. Jake, it's not up to you. She doesn't know what she's doing. Yeah, but it's her choice. None of this guy's story makes any sense. And I damn well don't believe that crap about him just showing up here like that. What did he do, walk in from another country? I pressed him about it the other day. I got nowhere. Hmm. Well, maybe it's my turn. Don't get crazy on me, Jake. No, I'm gonna be real hospitable, you know? Hey, why don't you and I take him out tomorrow night? Show him a good time. [chuckling] I'm gonna buy him a few beers. All right. [music playing on jukebox] [slurring] I... I better get going. Well, hold on there, chief. What's your hurry? Danny's waiting up, and I've got to... Teaching him about the French Revolution. [chuckling] And how do you know about that? You learn that in school, Zac? What school? Didn't go to school. Then how do you know so much about it? Saw it. -Saw it. -[both laughing] Like on TV, right? [laughing] Like on TV. Amigo, you better be thinking about moving on. Two weeks, I'm gone. He's not talking about two weeks. He means now. What's so special about two weeks? That's when I have to leave, two weeks. Well, now, if you know that, maybe there's lots of other things you ain't saying. I want an answer, damn it! I want to know who you are! -[Charlie] Jake! -Rebecca ain't available! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute. Let's look at this logically. Now, I know I seen him around here somewhere. It just won't come to me where. Trust me, Charlie, you've never seen me. How can you be so sure? How can you be so sure? Because you're human. Yes, sir. And what are you? I've never been human before. [laughing] I'm... I'm tired of all the riddles, Charlie. Now you remember what I told you. He's a little high-strung. Let's have another. Amigo, otra vez! [soft music playing] Sam. I always loved watching you sleep. I miss you so much. I've always been here. I know you love me, Rebecca. I know how much you love me. I'm glad. The best way to honor our life together is for you to be happy. Promise me that. I promise. Sam? Sam? Sam? Please don't go. [Rebecca] It was unbelievable. I know it was a dream, but it just seemed so real. Maybe it was a little bit of both. What do you mean? Well, I mean, maybe Sam wanted to talk to you, and he did it in the only way he could. You don't really believe that. Yeah, I do. I certainly expect to continue to give Tom the benefit of my opinions. And you too. [clears throat] For crying out loud, Mordecai, you scared me half to death. Odd choice of words. What now? They're not happy with the way you're handling yourself. [chuckling] You're here to learn about compassion, not alcohol. Well, thanks for reminding me. I'll be reminding you often. Well, you should remind them, too. Remind them there are consequences to their little experiment. What consequences? [sighs] I came here, I got involved with these people. Now what happens when I go? What happens to them? They go on. No, it's not that simple. Danny loses another person in his life. So does Rebecca. After what I've already done to them. What have you already done to them? I took her husband. The decision to take him was not yours. Zacariah, what's happening to you? Nothing is happening to me. I just never thought about what happens to the people that are left behind. [exhales deeply] So, when were you planning on telling me? Telling you what? That you're leaving in two weeks. I always said a month. That was before. -Before? -Yeah. Before. Somehow, I thought you wouldn't. Not if you feel the way that I feel. I feel the same way. [soft piano music playing] I've got to get going. Danny will be back any minute. -Bye. -Bye. Now you've done it. You're not a mortal man, Zacariah, and you can't pretend to live like one. You leave me alone. You don't understand. How you doing tonight, Rebecca? Jake. Um, this isn't exactly a good time. I know. But you've been ducking me a lot lately. [sighs] Well, actually, um... I have been wanting to talk to you. Well, that sounds ominous. Jake, I don't know what I would have done without you the last few years. You're like family. This ain't gonna be one of those... "I love you like a brother" speeches, is it? You're too important to me, and I just don't want us to misunderstand each other. No, there ain't no misunderstanding. At all. You know, you've been saying that... It was too soon for you to have a new man in your life, and I told you I'd wait. Now... Is that what you're asking me to do? Wait? Some more? That wouldn't be fair to you. Well, what do you think would be fair? [clears throat] Fair... would be for me to tell you... That I just don't think we have a future together. Are you telling me you see a future with somebody else? Maybe. [footsteps approaching] Hey. [sighs] -Hi. -Hi. [guitar music playing] Ow. -You all right? -Mm, yeah. Tom said he found some strays out near Pine Creek Canyon yesterday. I want to check on them, and I'd like to take Zac out there with me. [Danny] Can't you take Jake? Jake was gone when I got up this morning. Are you sure you want to do that, Charlie? Yes, ma'am. I am. [Danny] Think the lost cattle are out there? I don't know. But they might be. [Danny] Maybe I could go find them. You'd make a wise rancher, honey. Mm-hmm. Incidentally, these pancakes are the best I ever tasted. Want some eggs? No. Thank you. No. Mm. [Charlie] I've been giving a lot of thought to this bull you've been feeding us. Now it's time you were straight with me. Straight about what? About you and Rebecca. I promise you, if this thing between you and her turns ugly, I'm gonna be your worst enemy. It's hard, Charlie, but I care about her. You're gonna have to do more than care. What's supposed to happen to her when you move on, and you did say you were moving on, didn't you? You okay? I'm fine. Rebecca said you've been avoiding this canyon. I said I'm fine. -[cows mooing] -Whoa, whoa. Did you hear that? What? [mooing] Maybe there are some trapped cattle in here. Come on. [mooing] Well, I'll be damned. They're stealing our cattle. Come on. [country music playing] What the hell do you think you're doing? [gun fires] [groans] Don't move. [Charlie] Crawl out from underneath there! Get out from underneath there! Come on! Fast! Come on, crawl! I hope you know what you're doing. Just always wanted to see what that felt like. Obviously, Zacariah. But I still say it's crazy. Just behaving like a human. I shot you, mister. I don't think so. I want some answers. Who the hell are you, and who y'all working for? [Jake] I'll answer that. You in on this? Well, what the hell you think, old man? Drop that damn gun, Charlie. How could you do this to her? I'm trying to help her out, first by getting rid of these cattle, next, I'm gonna take care of him. Now, Charlie, you better tell your partner there, I got a dead aim, and I got him right in my sights. Your friend already tried to shoot me. He missed. Well, I won't. Easy, Zac, he's crazy. All right. You've got this coming. [grunts] [breathing heavily] Who the hell are you? I want to know how come those two bullets hit your body without leaving so much as a scratch. Nothing happened. I know what I saw. They hit you dead center, and you didn't even blink. You're wrong, Charlie. There's something about you and this canyon. You were there the day Sam died. It's coming back to me. Weird stuff was going on. I seen things like I ain't never seen before in this world. Sam was there, and somebody was with him. It was you. You tell me I'm crazy. You're not crazy, Charlie. You saw what you think you saw. It's the world I've been in for thousands of years. I'm a soul collector. Hah! That's nuts. No, it's not. You're telling me you took Sam's soul? Well, just where exactly did you take it? To a place more extraordinary than you can imagine. But you know it's true. You saw it for yourself. I'm here for 30 days. I have ten days left. And then what? And then I go back. You may want to get on the phone and let them know we're coming back there. So after you leave, things are gonna go back to the way they were before, -is that right? -Not exactly. I have to bring a soul back with me. Who? I won't know till it's time. Well, just make damn sure it's me. It's not my decision, Charlie. Listen, I'm old, I'm sick, and these folks got their whole lives ahead of them. These are decent folks. Don't you tell Rebecca what happened here. It's better for her not to know. She's gonna know sooner or later. It'll make no difference. [grunts] This old man is gonna watch how you handle this. You hear me? [sighs] I never wanted to hurt you. I was gonna have the money to take care of you and Danny. You son of a bitch. I know it would have been different if he hadn't come here. It would have changed nothing. Miss Rebecca, there is a little bit of good news, though. We found 30 head of cattle. Thirty head? We've lost hundreds. Yes, ma'am, but this is from the south pasture. It's part of our breeding stock. Well, maybe it's not too late. -Maybe Zac-- -Forget Zac. Well, I can't forget him. He'll stay now that we need him. No, ma'am, he said he was leaving. You don't understand. Miss Rebecca, you can't fall for him. It's too late for that, Charlie. [engine turns over] Charlie says you're still leaving. Look at me, Zac. I love you. I love you, too. [sad music playing] You're skating on very thin ice, Zacariah, very thin ice. [Helen] When is he leaving? He says next week. You've asked him to stay? Of course. Are you losing your charm? This isn't funny. Come here. Sit down. I read something the other day. I tore it out for you. "It is only with the heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is invisible to the eye." I'll always be here for you, Bec. Just look for me with your heart. You'll be okay. And if I'm not? Well, then, maybe I won't go. [coughing] [knock on door] Zac. You wanted to see me? I'm scared, Zac. I need to talk. Why are you asking me? Charlie said that you have... Some real comforting beliefs about death. He thought you could help. I think you let go of all the pain. [sighs] And you feel a lightness, just like you're floating. And you'll be at peace. And you'll be met by people that love you. Those people that have gone before you. My parents. Uncle Jeff. Yeah, all of them. They're waiting for you. And it's just like... Just like you'll be waiting for Tom and Ellie when they get there. And you'll be together. It sounds so real. [sniffles] But if it's as beautiful as you say, why are you crying? That's a good question. [soft music playing] [knock on door] Hey. You didn't have to do this. You didn't come to dinner. Well, wasn't up to eating. Charlie, you need to see a doctor. No, I don't. It's you I'm worried about, what with Miss Helen not feeling well and Zac, and I'm-- I-I just don't understand it. Why does he have to leave? Miss Rebecca, it's easy to see how much he cares for you. You have to accept... This is out of his control. I can't. I can't accept it because it doesn't make any sense. Maybe someday it will. [knock on door] Rebecca? What is it? You better come. Just think of me as an angel sitting on your shoulder, and whenever you need me, I'll just whisper in your ear. And I'll tell you that I love you and that you're a wonderful girl. [Ellie] I love you. And I love you. [sad violin music playing] This can't be right. Not now. It's too soon. I love you. I love you. You take care of them. You know I will. I love you, Rebecca. And I love you. [sobbing] No. [sad music playing] It's exactly the way you described. Thank you. I love you. Who are you? I'm called a soul collector. Just like the one you saw with Helen. Then why are you here? I was sent here to live as one of you on Earth for 30 days. And then what? And then I go back. No, I can't believe that. It's true, Rebecca. No. I didn't know how to tell you. And what exactly happened in there? I did that. It was for Tom and Ellie. I wanted to ease their pain. -Who are you here for? Whose soul? -I don't know. Maybe it was Helen's. Maybe that was the soul. Whose? I don't know. And I won't know until the time comes. No. No! No. [horn honks] How you holding on, Tom? Oh, it's tough. She's been gone a week, seems like forever. I can't let this ranch go under, Charlie. Helen would never want that. Well, if you're ready, my friend, We got a lot of work to do. Yep. Will I even remember you after today? I don't know. I almost wish you made this up as an excuse to leave. You won't even exist? [slow pleasant music playing] [Charlie grunting] [Tom] Charlie, are you all right? Oh, my chest. Charlie, are you okay? What's wrong? Charlie? -Charlie, what's wrong? -My chest. Okay, you hold on, Charlie. I'll get you some help. [Charlie] Oh, help me. Hold on, Charlie. Come here. [telephone ringing] Hello. Tom, what's wrong? Oh, my God. -I'm on my way. -What is it? Charlie had a heart attack. -I'll come with you. -No! No, you have to stay away from us today, you understand me? -It doesn't work that way. -Please. I mean it. Come on, Zac. Hey, Danny. Danny, hey. I can't. You know, we talked about this. Right? I told you I was gonna be going soon. I'm leaving in a little bit. I thought you were my friend. Look, I can... I can still be your friend, even if I'm not here, just not the kind of friend who plays with you. But you'll call and stuff, right? Dag burn it. I'm gonna be really far away. What place is too far to call? Well, some places don't have phones. Danny, we got to go. Come on, get in the car, okay? Come on, Lucky, get in the car. I don't know how to say goodbye to you. [sobs] I'll get you some red licorice and save it for when you come back. * If I loved you forever* * That's not time enough* * So I'll love you For the rest of my life* Look, mom, a toy store. Can we get Uncle Charlie a present? Okay. [whimpers] [barking] Lucky! Danny! No! Danny. Danny. Danny. Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah. Stand up. Let me see. Oh, my God. Zac! [man] I didn't see him. Zac. Zac. Zac. Zac. Zac, stay with me. Stay with me, please, stay with me. Please don't go. Please don't go. Please don't. Please stay. No. No. [ sobbing ] I will always love you, Zac. You come for me when it's my time. What in heaven's name were you thinking? I couldn't let him die. I just couldn't let Danny die. And you are not gonna let them reschedule this collection. Zacariah... You know the rules. Rules? What rules? They broke the rules the minute they sent me down here and I fell in love with these people. Not just Rebecca, but Danny and Helen's family, Charlie. Plowed into their lives like a freight train... Leaving chaos behind me. Forget the rules, Mordecai. We owe them. I would give up eternity to spend one lifetime with this woman. Well... It's time to go. [Mordecai] The council heard you, Zacariah. It is pleased with your growth as both a spirit and a human being. Some might say you turned out to be a better man than a soul collector. Therefore, your reward will be the granting of a long life for Danny. They want you to guide him to adulthood. To do that, they will allow you to live a life on Earth, with all the joys and sorrows that are gifted to a human soul. Your powers as a collector will be stripped, but you will be granted the blessings of mortal man. * Life was uncertain * Then I found you * Time couldn't Keep us apart* * If I held you forever* * It wouldn't be enough * So I'll kiss you And hold you tonight * * If I loved you forever* * That's not time enough * So I'll love you The rest of my life * * So I'll love you The rest of my life *
