( Speaking Spanish ) But it's almost-- ( sighs ) almost 8:00. Go to your room. I'll be right with you. What do you want me to do? My parents lent me the house with this condition only. ( Speaks ) Well, let's do nothing. Man: Xo, look... you have to sleep. Being a child is a bitch, I know, but that's how things are. But in my house I don't have to go to sleep until 10:00. Look, in this neighborhood, children have to sleep early, because if not... err... - { woman screams ) - ( snowman growls ) - ...the Abominable Showman comes! - But it doesn't show here. You tell him that when he comes to get you. - Your uncle is all wrong. - He is my cousin, not my uncle. Yes, baby, it doesn't snow in Mexico City. Any idiot knows that. But many, many years ago there was a snowfall that covered the city. It came from the distant region of Nepal and sat here for 40 days in which the sun barely came out to warm. It was snowing day after day. People couldn't go outside and that's why they took so long to realize what was happening. Many children were disappearing from their homes. You know what happened to them? But your uncle does, right? They were found... - dead? - Dead, of course. But that wasn't the worst part of it. Their hearts were torn out. After that, they realized that whoever had done it only ate children's hearts. - When they finally found him... - ( weapons clanging ) ...one of the bloodiest battles in all of history took place. The battle was so long that in 1958 the government had to make a truce. Benito Juarez agreed with the snowman that he could live in a cold-storage container with one condition-- he could only go out at night and could only take the children who were not lying down after 8:00. They don't have to be asleep, but lying in their beds. Woman: But they have to demonstrate good will if they are not asleep - and at least they must count sheep. - And how is he? He rings a bell and has a cart where he puts the children's bodies. And he screams! Sure. - He screams. - Is he the Bogeyman? If you have to choose, choose the Bogeyman. It's the kind of person that will only abduct you. The Snowman from Mexico will take out your little heart and before you die, you'll see him eat it. - Man #2: Gaaarbiishhhhhhh... -(gasps) - Did you hear that? - ( bell ringing ) - Gaaarbiishhhhhhh... - Quick, Xochitl, close your eyes, close your eyes.

We just killed a child. Oh, it wasn't alive to begin with. Not by law. Hmm. The rebels were delivering the child to the Vatic-- “"prophet” of all mentals. With such power, his very existence threatens humanity, but once we've reanimated and bio-vac'd every last bit of brain matter, we may finally ascertain his location. A fine achievement, officer. You see, the agency has a far greater purpose than its... ( sniffs, exhales ) "Public position." You've given 10 years of service to your unit, officer. Your records are excellent. I'm pleased to say that your permits have been approved. Sir. ( laughs ) - Yes sir, but-- - I'm not finished. While your permits are approved, there are biological factors beyond the agency's control. Reanimate the infant. - ( Inhales sharply ) - ( gun humming ) I can't let you do this. Nezbit, Officer Lainey has clearly been compromised. - ( Nezbit whirring ) - Arrest her. I won't let you re-murder a child. Oh, grow up!

We weren't even supposed to have animation! Well, we talked about a bunch of different ideas, remember? Look at this list of, err, "W"s I got here. Oh my God, what the fuck is wrong with you? We're gonna get this done. Hold on, it's a-- - Why do you do this? - Here's the thing-- walrus. It's like a Godzilla-walrus.

She's just killed a bunch of, like... trolls? All right, whatever, she's covered in blood. Okay. Let's do that. Let's do that this weekend. I'm not sure I even want to do that one. I'm just saying it's an idea. "W" is for wheelchair. It's an old man-- an evil old man. He's in the wheelchair-- everybody hates old people. - He gets pushed off a fucking cliff. - ( screams ) I got-- ummm... I got-- I got nothing. You guys! Come to the conference room. Come on, you gotta see this! Man on TV: Nancy, I'm coming to you from downtown Hollywood. I've got to tell you, some of the strangest things I have ever seen... - Oh fuck, what's going on? - ...are going on right now. If you can see, over my head, the most oddest looking colored gases. Uh, they're like chemtrails, I guess, and they seem to be followed by other planes and copters, and a general sense of... - "W"! - ...panic seems to have hit the area. Believe it or not, Nancy, we're actually getting reports of people seeing clown zombies in the streets. Fuckin' clown zombies? That's fucking stupid! What, are they looking for magnets? "W"? I just... Is that a "W" on there? What's up with these "W"s? Man on TV: Is this some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, as we watch the horror of our own minds pushing humanity toward extinction? Can we live in a world that is more immoral than our own brains, - our own ideas? - No! Don't open the door! We live in a process that is already infested, already mutated, already over! - Already blank-- already blank.. - ( screaming ) ...from a wave of congealed confidence! ( Echoing ) My elbows are untouchable! My elbows are sharp! I am transparent. I am solid in the form of this new liberty reborn! You-you-you are invisible in this new world! I hover above you... above as below. I am legion. A traced mindfuck of a billion bombs dropping on your fired synapses, your tired synapses! You are inserted, digested, gestated! Lie in the waste of your own vision, gutter punks to bigger words that you ate years ago! That you tasted and shat upon years ago! That you chewed and corrupted after the seeds were buried long ago! I am the one with seven heads! I am the thing that laughs! ( Deep voice ) I am the thing that waits... for you! ( Witch cackling ) What the fuck? ( Gurgling ) ( Train rattling ) ( P.A. chimes)) ( Woman speaking French over P.A.) ( Train approaching ) ( Wheels squeak ) ( Beeps ) ( Muttering in French) Damn, I can't believe it. Fucking fat girl! ( Train rattling ) ( Mutters ) Man: So, so-- Look at that gelatin. Hey, gelatin! Hold on, hold on. Madame, excuse me. You're fat, madame. You have to do something after a while. - Woman: Yes, thanks. - No, it shows. ( laughs, shouts ) ( Mimicking velociraptor ) You performed in Jurassic Park, didn't you? The Brontosaurus. - Get out, get out! - (laughs ) - Woman: Gosh... look at this. - ( woman #2 laughs, mutters ) Hey, take a break on the peanut butter. Oh my gosh, if I were her, I wouldn't go out. - Oh my gosh! Hey hey hey, so true! - ( both laughing ) Ah ah ah... for sure. She can't climb up the stairs. Woman #2: Hey, take a ride to the gym! -(TV turns on ) - ( music playing ) ( Woman speaking on TV ) ( In French ) Me, with my cereal, I can manage my summer slimness. - ( Sloshes ) - ( breathing heavily ) Slimness, flat tummy... get ready for the summer! With low dye... say no to fat! - Rich in vitamins... - ( grunts) My body loves it, as you can see! Diet cereals make me thinner and help you keep it! ( Breathing heavily ) Me, for my hair, I use Protif! ( Heart beating ) ( Inhales sharply ) ( Inhales sharply ) Ah! Ah! ( Moaning, cries ) ( Cries out) (yells) (yelling ) ( Inhales sharply, grunting ) ( Clatters ) ( Whirring ) ( Humming ) ( Screaming ) ( Electric buzzing ) Woman on TV: Me, with my cereals, I can manage my summer...

The Rising Sun was flooded with cesium. Our soft-bellied government officials covered it all up and our DNA underwent a violent transformation. - Our cells were forever altered... - ( clicks) ...and the people of Japan welcomed a new century of mutants. Japanese food products are totally safe. Nuclear energy is also safe. It's a gift from our beloved, - nice country America. - ( gunshot) ( Rock "Star-Spangled Banner" playing ) ( Man speaking, distorted ) ( Gasps, screams ) (in Japanese) Our technology is simple. Even an inferior nation can use it. It is fully automatic and indestructible. - ( Man yells ) - ( screams ) (gasps) - (crying ) - ( chitters ) ( Moans ) ( In Japanese ) Our talented personnel are totally talented and our shitty bastards are perfectly shitty. White means white-skinned human. Not black, nor yellow, nor red. (crying ) ( Clanks ) ( Screaming ) ( laughing ) ( In English) Made in America. ( In Japanese ) Ever since Kunta Kinte was abducted by America, the blacks have harbored a hatred for the whites. - ( Man yelling ) - ( screaming continues ) ( Buzzing ) ( Shouts ) ( Grunts) - ( Shouts ) - ( both grunting ) ( Screaming ) ( In English ) Let's change the way of saying "nuclear energy.” It's more accurate to say "fission-cultivated electricity.” Have no fear. Small and lightweight, their outer walls are made more thin and weak than usual. ( Explosion ) - ( Explosion ) - ( laughing ) (in Japanese) We yellow people love tangerines!
