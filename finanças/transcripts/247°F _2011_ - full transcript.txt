That was really sweet of your parents. What, dinner? Dinner for the whole entire wedding party. Now everybody knows each other and the whole day will go great. Did you see him running after the drinks? Man: Everything. I mean- The bed set in the catalogue- it's nice, right? If you say so. You know that, to me, a bed is a bed. Yeah, well, what if we go look at it? Maybe. - Tomorrow morning? Okay, you want me to get out of bed to go see a bed? Not just any bed. Our bed. We'll see, okay. Yeah? - We'll see. I just love you so. Jamie. Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie, wake up! Wake up, please! Jamie! Woman: Jenna! Jenna! Jenna. Come on, I've been looking all over for you. I was listening to music. I couldn't hear you. So is it cooI if we leave the car here? Yeah, yeah, tourist season doesn't start for another week. This weather- God damn, this weather is perfect. Perfect. - It's gonna be a good weekend. We love you, weather. We love you, weather. Ian's there. Everyone's waiting for us, so let's not be rude. I can't wait for the party tonight. It's invite only. That's pretty cool. And he's actually really kind of hot- Ian. Did you get any good pictures? Yeah. Here, take a look. That's really pretty. Yeah, I like this one. You see how it's framed? Yeah. Oh, yeah. You're really talented. I mean, that kind of talent really amazes me. Thanks. Come on, everyone's waiting. Oh, here come the girls. Yeah, she's cute. Renee. - Hi, guys. What's up, Renee? Ian, this is Jenna. Jenna, this is Ian. Hi. Nice to meet you. - Thanks for inviting us. Okay, blah-blah-blah. Come on, let's go. Where are we going? - I guess we're getting on the boat. Man: Boat ride. - Ian: Yeah, come on. Why the boat? - It takes about an hour to drive around the lake, so we'll take the boat. Whoo! What's up, world? Gotta love this. Man, this is great. - It's the way to go. Whoo! All right, come on, man, let me drive. She's all yours. - Yeah? Yeah. - All right. Just watch out for other boats and be respectful. Isn't that nice? Whoo! Yeah. Whoo! - I know, I know. Michael! What? - Stop it. I'm sorry. You know I can't help myself. Well, can you try? Seriously, try. All right, I'll try. Michael! Jenna: What's up with this May Day celebration anyway? Ian: Well, the locals celebrate May Day. It's a big festival every year. So basically it brings them good luck for the summer. And it's pretty much just an excuse for the locals to get wasted. Isn't it a pagan tradition? I guess we're gonna party like a bunch of pagans tonight, then. I'm about to fuck you like a pagan tonight. Pervert. - Hey. I'm getting you tonight. Wait. I like Jenna. She seems interesting. Oh, God. - She's cute. You sound like Renee. That's what she always says- she's so smart and interesting and fun. And maybe she is, but what a load, man. Renee: What? - Where are the bags? Where are the bags? You said you were gonna get the bags, remember? Jenna: Wait, did we leave them down there? No, no, they're up at the cabin already. Wade got them. This is his boat. Who's Wade? Wade is a giant, beastly man whom I love. That's actually Wade up there. What's up, Wade? - Michael: What's up, Wade? Come on up. He looks like a wrestler. - He's the reason why we're here. How so? He's my uncle. He rents out this cabin every year. And he decided to let us have it during May Day. So we got hooked up. Oh, man, remember that weed he gave us last summer? Come on, babe, let's go. Ian: Mm-hmm. What? Oh, you know, what's cool is that he got us tickets for the big party tonight. So I hope you like to dance. Do you smoke? Do I smoke? Every now and then. Not really, although Wade likes to think everyone does. Big Wade, what's up, man? - How are you doing? Good to see you. - Oh! This is my girlfriend Renee. - I didn't see that rock there. How are you? Nice to meet you. - Hello. How are you today? Hey, there he is. Hey, Ian. - How are you doing? Good. How is your mother doing? - You missed her birthday again. Again. - No worries. Hey, Wade, this is Jenna. Jenna, this is Wade. Hello, Jenna. - Hi. Hey, Beau! What's up, buddy? Michael: Oh, my gosh. - Renee: Who's this? Wade: Oh, that is Beau. - Jenna: Beau. Oh. Hi. - Ian: He likes you. He doesn't like you much, huh? - And that is Beau. Beau, get out of here. Go away. - Renee: Oh, he's so cute. Jenna: He's really friendly. Welcome shots for everyone. I made it myself. You are too kind. There you go. One for the lovely lady. Wade: There you go. - Ian: Thank you, sir. Jenna. - No, thank you. Are you sure? - Yeah. All right. - I'll take that. Hey, Wade, where did you put the bags? Just inside the door. - Okay. Well, a celebration calls for mead. What's mead? - Moonshine. Oh, dear. - Ooh. Wade: Bottoms up. - Michael: One can only hope. Moonshine. Make sure to come back and eat. - Oh, I never miss a meal. Wade, is it okay if I-? - No problem. I made it for you guys. There's a case of beer in the fridge. And if you need more, just let me know. Wade, you rock. - You're awesome. Let's do it. Party! - Wade: All right, have fun, guys. Come on, Beau, let's go. Renee: Wow. - All right, so I looked this up. Renee: This is really beautiful. Mead dates back to around 7,000 BC. What? - Oh, yeah. And it will be everywhere at the pagan festival. It's a big pagan tradition. - Those cavemen were getting down. I hope Wade comes back soon. - He'll come back. I don't want him to feel like we're ungratefuI. No, no, he's cooI. He'll definitely come back. All right, you guys, so the bedrooms are upstairs. You two can take one. The other one's for Jenna. What about you? Me- I get the couch. Well, we're gonna go get settled. Hey! You know, you can take the bedroom. No, that's okay. This is the most comfortable couch in the world. Oh, God. Indeed, yeah. I don't think we want to hear what comes next. Can I get you a beer? - Please. Cool. All right, well, I guess you can watch me make dinner. No, but I will help. Even better. Cheers. - Cheers. So why an English degree? 'Cause he likes poverty. I don't see you making six figures. Oh, good job. 'Cause I don't have to. Renee is bringing home all the big bucks. Ain't that right, baby? She's wearing the pants too, if you're cool with that. Mm-hmm, just so I can take them off. No, seriously, why? I don't know. I always had a fascination with literature. And I've always loved to write. I started off in the sciences, but that just didn't feel like the right direction for me. Sciences? - Yeah. He was a physics major. - Physics? Really? Stuff that only God should know. Yeah, stuff that only God should know. So what are you gonna do- teach? No, I don't think I want to teach. I want to reach a wider audience than that. Writing for publication was my major and communication was my minor. So writing? Bingo. True poverty. Thank you. Thank you for your support. I'm gonna make it a long way with all of this support. Anytime, man. Good luck with that. I keep telling Ian he needs to move up here and work with me. Life's a vacation and you get paid for it. It's true. Wade, you can count me in. Cheers to that. You know, in no way do I mean to offend you, because I love you, but I just feeI like I'm meant for something more, you know, something with more significance, something with weight, something that matters. Well, I think having fun and making people happy- that's what matters, right? Ian: Fair enough. Hey, Beau. Are you lonely out here? What are you looking at? Oh, man. Thanks. Good boy. Look how cute you are. So what do you think? What? About all this- the food, the fun, the cabin. It's not very often that you go out of your comfort zone. I just want to make sure that you're having fun. No, it's good. I'm having a really great time. So let's go. - Okay. Now, that's what I like to see- friends having fun. Make sure you take your camera tonight, 'cause there's gonna be fireworks. Oh, and don't forget your invitations, 'cause they won't let you in the party without them. Okay. Thank you for getting us the invitations. No problem. - Aren't you gonna be there? You might not see me, but I'll be there. Good night. - What, are you leaving already? Well, I'll be back. I gotta go set some things up. Come on, Beau. - Bye. Good night. Beau, will you stop flirting with the girls? Come on, Beau. Good night. - Good night. Hey, I found one of those- what do you call those things? Steam rooms? - Ah, the sauna. Michael: Oh, man, we gotta do that. Have to do what? Go in the sauna. Renee: Mm. - Michael: Why not? Ian: Yeah, I think you'II like it. Renee: I don't know. It just doesn't sound too party-ish. Michael: Party-ish? I don't think that's a word. What do you think, Ian? Ian: I don't know. I think it sounds kind of word-ish. Screw you, guys. You know what I meant. Ian, what about the party? I mean, don't we have to get ready? Yeah. - What did Wade say? He said we had plenty of time, right? Ian: Yeah, I think it'll be fine, you know, give us a chance to relax a little bit. All right, well, you know how to work the thing, right? Yeah, yeah. - Okay, I'm gonna go change. I'll turn it on. - Okay. Go get in your underwear. What do you say, Jenna? Yeah? What are you thinking? I don't know. I mean, I just don't- What are you looking at? Hurry up. Anyway, I just- I don't want you to, like, do anything you're uncomfortable doing. I don't want you to, like, feel like you have to, so... No, it's okay. Just give me a few minutes. I'll go upstairs and get ready. Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay. Ooh. It's hot. It's hot in here. - It's hot in here. It's nice. Michael: Oh, man. Oh, man, here. You need to catch up. I don't know if that's possible, even. A pretty fast pace right here. Oh, man. Hello, boys. Michael: There she is. Ooh. Wow, this is something, huh? Damn. - Scoot over. Lucky man. Yeah, round two pretty soon. - Stop it. You look hot. Where's Jenna? She's coming. I'll go get her. Go get her, cowboy. Oh, there she is. Where are you headed? Nowhere. I was just looking around. You know, it's really ragged and rustic. Yeah, this place is great. Come on. Ian: Take a seat. Sit down. Get comfy. You know, I just brought two waters. Let me go- - No, no, that's fine. We're fine. We've got drinks. We'll go out and get some later. Michael: I'm fine. Whoo-hoo! Give me one of those waters. Ooh, thanks. I think this is the first time I've ever had beer in a sauna. So Wade built this? He did? Ian: Yeah. Yeah, this and everything else here. He redid the whole place when he got it. This is his latest and most recent installment- a European sauna. It's nice. Yeah, it's pretty cool. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, in a hot way. - Hey-oh! Lame joke. Oh, yeah, coming from the girI who coined the term "party-ish. " Okay, that was funny. Yeah, I thought it was funny. Well, you'd have to think it's funny. She's your girlfriend. Yeah, you're right. - Yeah, politics. It's hot in here. 184 degrees. Really? - It's crazy hot. Yeah, it can get hotter too. Checking out the rocks? - Yeah. There's a lot of them. Those are the type of rocks that you pour water on them to get steam, right? - Yep. If you want steam. Do you want steam? No, this is fine. I'm sensing that you want some steam. Okay. Why not make it hotter than it already is, huh? Here we go. Ian: Ooh. Renee: Hey, that's cool. Some more. Ooh. That seems to be enough. Too bad we don't have any snow to roll around in. Ha. You know, if you guys are hot, we can always go jump in the lake. Really? - Yeah. You want to? - Yeah. Let's go. - That actually sounds like a good idea. Ian: Wow, we are pathetic. We lasted two minutes in here. Hey, I lasted longer than you guys. I was here first. - 20 seconds. Ooh, it's cold. - It's cold. It's cold. Oh, my feet are like icicles. - Let's go. Jenna: Oh, my Gosh, it's cold. It's cold! Jenna: Wait, you mean, like, go in the sauna again? Ian: Yeah, it's the best way to warm up. Jenna: I thought you just meant come inside. Ian: I'm telling you, it'll warm you up. Renee: Yeah, come on, let's go back in. I'm freezing. Jenna: Okay. Ian: Drinks? Renee: Yeah, get me a beer. - Jenna: A water, please. Ian: Beer coming right up. "Why don't you grab his dick?" Really? She didn't seem to mind when I said it, man. Pour me a small one. - A small one? Yeah. - Sure. There you go. Okay, that's not a small one. Enjoying yourself? Yeah. Good. I don't know. There's something about her I like. I think the thing you like about her is that she was half-naked. That might have something to do with it. I'm on another world, man. To good times. - To good times. Oh, this does not get any better... Ever. - ... the drunker I get. I'm on another world. We should probably get back down. Yeah. Yeah. I'm warning you. She's a load, man. - Yeah, yeah. You'll see. You'll see. Michael, why do you drink this much? Oh. That's a trick floor there. Renee: Can you just please slow it down on the drinking, Michael? Oh, hey, Beau. How are you doing? Good boy. Good boy. Come on, let's go. Come on, Beau. Oh, this is the herbal aromas I was telling you about. We've got jasmine, lavender, cinnamon. Do you want to do some cinnamon? Yeah? I'm freezing. - I know it's cold, baby. What are you guys doing? - Some herbal aromas. You guys want to go in there one more time? It's the last time. It's the last time. Come on. Warm up. Not really. Oh, look, babe, listen. Listen. No. Ow. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What? - Look. Listen. Why don't we just leave them alone? No. You're drunk. Stop it. - I'm not drunk. Yes, you are. - You're drunk. Let's get some of this. Cinnamon was a good choice. Here we go. Let's go upstairs. - No, I don't want to. I am tired of taking care of you. Stop. Whatever. You gotta go take care of Jenna. I understand. Go ahead. Go ahead. Where are you going, MichaeI? Bathroom. You'd better not be peeing on yourself out there. I'm not. He's probably just mad because he didn't get what he wanted. Or he's just going to the bathroom. Renee: Or he's just drunk again. God, he's just turned into such a dipwad. Like, I'm so sick of taking care of him all the time. What do you mean? It's the same old Michael. No, it is not the same old MichaeI. And how would you know anyway? You haven't been around the last two years. He's changed. He's just- he's completely different. I don't know. I don't know if people change. I mean, not on the core level, on a souI leveI. I think we're all born with an inherent wholeness. I think because of our circumstances and situations, maybe we appear different on the surface. Do you ever shut up? I'm just so sick of taking care of everyone. Yikes. See? Michael, what are you doing out there? I am not babysitting your drunk ass all night. I am going to that party and I'm having a really good time. Do you hear me? Michael, I don't think you want to upset her anymore. I'm gonna go get him. No, don't. He's just drunk and I'm sick of him ruining everything again. He's just being a dick because I didn't want to sneak off for another drunken hump. Ugh. God, it's warm. God, it is just the same thing all the time, like all the time. I am sick of it. Renee, it's not that bad. No, it is. It is. It's just like it used to be fun, but lately I- just everything- I can't. God. Hey, let's just- let's go. We'll go upstairs. No, just give her a few minutes. No, I want to go. It's hot. I want to get out of here. - Jenna: Okay. What's the matter? - I don't know. Well, maybe it's locked. Just turn it. No, there's no lock. Look. It looks like it wants to open. Maybe it's just swollen from the heat, you know? No. I mean, this is made for that, right? Okay, well, if it's not locked, then it should open. Just relax. - Don't tell me to relax. Open it. Jenna, come on. - Hey, take it easy. It's gonna be all right. - Open it! Jenna, please. No, I am not going to be stuck in here. Okay, Jenna, stop it. - I am not going to be stuck in here. Jenna. What is up with this claustrophobic shit? What are you talking about? Where did this come from? You never used to be claustrophobic. Maybe I am not claustrophobic, but this bothers me. I cannot be stuck in here. - Okay. You don't know what it was like being trapped for so long. Fine. Look, did you take your pill today? No. What the fuck are you trying to do? I'm trying not to rely on them. Well, nice time for self-improvement. I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know that we were gonna be trapped in here? Hey, we're not trapped. It's okay. I'll get us out of here. Just clear some space. Michael! Michael! What are you doing? - It's Michael. He locked us in here. MichaeI! - Why would he lock us in here? As a joke. Michael! No, even Michael wouldn't play a joke like that. You don't think so? What about all the stupid shit that he does? It's all jokes. MichaeI! He does do a lot of stupid shit. Michael! - Michael! Ian: It's not funny anymore! It's hilarious. We're all laughing. Renee: Michael! Renee, slow down. Slow down. If he locked us in here, I'm certain he'll let us out. Besides, he's got the attention span of a three-year-old. He will get bored, believe me. This isn't good for us in here. It's not good for our hearts. Just- just save your energy. Just drink some water. He'll let us out. If it's a joke, he'll let us out. This is a joke? Really? I'm not saying it's a good one. Look, let's just relax. No, I don't want to relax. I want to get the hell out of here. Michael! I'm hot. - Renee. And I have a headache. Michael! - Renee. I'm hot and I have a headache. Let us out! Michael! - Renee, Renee, look, sit down. You're dehydrated. He's gonna let us out. Get some water. You're really dehydrated. Just- look, he'll let us out. Believe me, he's not that cruel. What if he forgets? - He's not gonna forget. Renee: What if drunken Mike starts playing Firefighter? We'll be in here all night. Wade- Wade gave him weed. I mean, just a joint, but- Wade? And you want me to wait in here for him? That idiot is somewhere stupid and stoned and drunk. And meanwhile, you know very well that this little joke could be an all-night thing. I mean- I mean, somebody will come back. I mean, Wade- Wade will come back. What? He's not gonna come back. I mean, at least not for a while. Wait, why wouldn't Wade come back? Why would he come back? He thinks we're gonna be at the party. Look, look, this isn't that bad. Look, let's just burn off some extra calories. If we can figure out why the door won't open, we can figure out how to open it. Right? Simple logic. Shit. - What? What is it? What is it? Let me see. What is that? I can't tell. Looks like something's blocking the door. Let us out, Michael! Michael! Let us out. Michael! Man: Well, it's about time. Wade: And a happy May Day to you, too. You want to deal with this now or later? Man: Later. Let's go check it out. Wade: All right, man. Man: How are those renters of yours? Wade: They're having a high old time, courtesy of old Uncle Wade. Man: Yeah? - Yep. Man: Well, we're gonna have a good time tonight, man. What are we gonna do? I'm not sure. I don't know, but we'll figure it out. Break the window. No, let's not start breaking things just yet. We can't stay in here. We're gonna suffocate or something. It's too hot. I can't breathe. We're not gonna suffocate. We have plenty of air. It's the heat that we have to worry about. That's why I said let's just take it easy, drink plenty of water, even if it's warm. Yeah, he's right. A person can only stay in here for so long before suffering heat stroke. Heat stroke? What's that? What's heat stroke? We'll be out of here before that even happens. No, no, no, tell me what happens. What happens? Tell me. It's when your body stops trying to cool itself off. You- you get dizzy. You get headaches. You vomit. You pass out. Die? - No. No, no, no. We're gonna die? - We're not gonna die. No, we're not gonna die. That's not gonna happen. Okay, well, for God's sake, I mean, I'm not gonna die in here. We're gonna get out of here, trust me. Can you just turn it off? Can you just turn it off now? If that were a possibility, don't you think I would have done that by now? The controls are outside. - Why? That's stupid. I don't know. So they don't corrode. - That's stupid. It's not safe. There's gotta be something in here. - I've never seen anything else. This isn't like a gym or a hotel. It's not idiot-proof. Well, then you shouldn't have let MichaeI anywhere near it. I- Oh, that's just a thermometer. But behind it? Oh, no, that's just the- the thermostat, but- But what? It's different. You know, it looks electronic and it's covered with plastic. So? - So I don't know. Yeah, but it's the thermostat, right? Well, it's not like the thermostat that you'd see on the wall in your house. I mean, there's no control on it. Like I said, the control is outside. This is how it works: you set the temperature outside, the heater runs. And when it gets to that temperature, the heater turns off. This is the part that tells the heater to turn off. I'm not sure that I want to mess with this. Well, why not? That's why not. Shit. What about this thing? The heater? No, don't touch it. It's gas. I don't want to fuck around with gas. That's the last thing that we want to be inhaling right now. Michael! Michael! - Renee. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Give me the bucket. - What for? Just give me the bucket. The water's gone. - What? It's fine. It's fine. Hey, will you give me those waters? What are you gonna do? - Break the window. Here. I thought you didn't want to break it. Well... here. I don't know what else to do. I think it will help. Renee: What about five minutes ago? Here you go. Argh. Argh. Hurry up. Hurry up. - Hang on. It has to cool. Come on, it's not gonna get any cooler. It's cool enough. Renee, I've burned my hand once. Just let it cooI off. Okay, I can't take it anymore in here. I have to get out of here. It is too hot. I gotta get out of here. I can't be in here any longer. - It'll be all right. It's not getting any cooler. Watch out. Fuck. Fuck! Oh, my God, air. Renee: Michael! - Jenna: MichaeI! Renee: Michael! Ian: Michael! Renee: Michael! Fucking asshole. Michael! Michael! Michael! Renee: Mike! Ian: Oh, damn. We can stop blaming Michael. Renee: Why? Ian: Because he didn't lock us in here. There's a ladder that seems to be wedged between the doors. It must have fallen. Maybe that drunk ass knocked it over. No, come on, let's give him some credit. We don't know that. Right. Fucking asshole. You're an asshole, Michael! Hey, hey, save your energy. God, he's such an asshole. Yeah, well, what are we gonna do? I don't know. It seems to be better than it was before. I mean, we got some fresh air in here, right? Yeah. - I mean, that's- that's a vast improvement. This feels good. Ian: I wouldn't do that if I were you. Renee: I know. 'Cause it stinks. Feels great. It's just temporary relief. I don't care if it's just temporary relief. Calm the fuck down. I'm just saying it's not gonna do anything for the long run. Why not? Because you know how you said that your body wasn't that hot earlier? Yeah. - Well, when you get that hot, your body tries to protect itself. So your skin starts to collect sweat and other stuff that insulates it. And right now you're tricking your body to think it's cooler than it is. I don't think that's a good idea. It's cooler in here anyway. We broke the window. The cool air is coming in. That's good. - Yeah, but I- What? Let me see this. It might seem cooler right now, but I promise you it's not gonna stay that way. That heater is gonna turn back on. And- fuckin'- A. And it's gonna stay on. What? Why? Because it's gonna try to get back up to that original temperature. And we had it set to 185 degrees. And since the window's broken, this thing- it's never gonna reach that temperature. So think of it like- like a convection oven rather than a steamer. Watch out. Nice analogy. Thanks. Watch out. Watch out. Come on, bitch. Ah. Fuck. Fuck. Ah! Come on. Fuck. There's got to be a way to turn this off. If you can think of it, you get the prize. Don't. Hey, don't fuck with that. It's the only control we have. What do you mean, controI? You said we couldn't turn it off. Well, I'm telling you, we don't want this thing running full blast, trust me. What's the difference? Deep-fried, slow-roasted- what does it matter, huh? And how do you know that this thing just won't turn off if we just break this thing? I'm not saying that I know for certain. See? I knew it. - Renee, just don't. Look, I never said that I knew it, all right? I'm just saying I know what the worst could be. Oh, yeah? What's that? Well, this thing can get up to about 250 degrees. Do you want to risk that? Renee- - You want your skin to fucking melt? Renee, just don't, okay? What, you're on his side now? No, I'm not taking any sides. I just don't think that we should do anything that we don't have to do. That's typical Jenna- let's just not do anything at all, hmm? What's the difference? Time. At least that's what Ian's telling us- it'll give us time. Time? Time? Time for what? I don't know. To try to get out of here. To wait for somebody to come. Wait for whom? MichaeI? You know as damn well as I do he's passed out like a fucking baby somewhere. Fuck. Maybe we'll wait for Wade to come back. Wade is not coming back either. Why would he come back? He thinks we're at the party. No one is coming back for us. I am sick of waiting. I want to get out of here now. We all want to get out of here. - Oh, you want to get out of here? You know, I have a life to get back to. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What is it? Renee: What are you doing? Well, I think I can short out this light. You know, blow the fuse. Hopefully this is tied into the heater controls. When the power turns off, the heater will turn off. Hey, will you hand me that toweI? Wouldn't that just leave us in the dark? Possibly. That's better than being roasted to death. Hand me the bucket. What? - The bucket and the ladle. What are you gonna do now? I'm gonna try to jam it in the socket, blow it out. All right, here we go. All right, three, two, one. Renee: Ian! Are you okay? Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian. Oh, my God. Get a towel- a towel. Come on, come on. Fuck, it didn't work. - Come on, get up. Get up. Get up. Good job, Beau. Ajob well done, buddy. Go on. Go, go. Go on. Good boy. All right, man, are you ready? - Yeah. Wade: Let's do this. Let's get this shit done. And double-check the lines. - Okay. Be careful. Be careful. We got two minutes, man. Maybe you should grab the stuff, fire it up. Okay. Jenna: Why did you say that? Renee: Say what? "I have a reason to live. " I didn't mean it like that. I didn't mean it. Remember when we got them? Myrtle Beach, senior trip. It was a really good time. Yeah. We used to spend every second together, I mean, just us. We used to have so much fun, laughing so hard. That was a long time ago. I know. I was just saying. Renee: Things change. You have to grow up. You can't just sit around giggling with your best friend all day. You don't even want to. At least that would make a difference. Well, people change, too. And I am not the same person. And you are not the same person. Jenna: You didn't even give me a chance. Renee: Jenna, it's been three years since the a- since Jamie- it's been three years. And I tried. How many times did I invite you? And how many times did you find reasons to say no? Yeah, well, it's us. We're not just anybody. I mean, we grew up together. For God's sakes, Renee, I was gonna ask you to be my maid of honor. Renee: What are you saying? That I haven't been a good friend? That I shouldn't have been your maid of honor? No, I'm not saying that. I just- Ian: Shh. What now? I think I hear Beau. Beau. Beau. Beau. Beau. Ian: Beau. Here, Beau. - Beau. Beau! Beau! Beau! Come on, Beau! Please, God. Let us out, Beau. Beau! Please, God. Let us out, Beau. Ian: Wade! Wade! Renee: Beau, please! Anybody! Somebody! You got your headset on? You ready? - Yeah. All right. Here we go. Hey, Beau, what's up? Beau, are you all right? What are you barking at, man? Where's Wade? Beau, hey, where's Wade? Michael. Michael. Michael! Renee: Michael! - Ian: Michael! Michael, don't leave me in here. - Michael! Don't leave me in here. - Hey! Whoo! - Ow! All right, man, we can get the rest of this stuff in the morning. I'll get it tomorrow, no worries. - Are you sure? I got it, man. - All right. Beau. What's gotten into you? Come here, boy. Come on. Beau. What the hell? Beau. Beau, what the hell has gotten into you, boy? Come on, man, it's the same fireworks every year. Come on, boy. Beau, Beau, Beau, Beau. Calm down. Beau, let's go. We're going home. God damn it, Beau. Beau. Beau. Damn it. Where the hell are you going? Beau. Well, well, well, what do we have here? Wade, what's up, my man? Hey, Beau. What are you doing out here? I thought you were at the party. Yeah, so did I, man, so did I. What do you mean? Well, they went to the party, but they left me passed out on the couch. Didn't wake me up or nothing. - Really? Yeah. - Oh, man. But, man, that stuff you gave me- whoo! That shit knocked me out, man. That's good stuff. I told you it would. That's some really good stuff, man. I mean, one minute I was sitting there having a smoke and playing video games, next minute I was passed out and your crazy dog was barking. Oh, dog, shut up. Yeah, I don't know what's gotten into him. Must have been the fireworks or something. Yo, Ian. Aw, shut up. God, dog, shut the fuck up. Yo, Ian. Babe, are you upstairs? Dog, shut up. Wade. Oh, Wade. So what are you doing now? Going back to the house, I guess. Why don't you go back to the party? Hey, how are you doing? - Your invitation, please. No, not my thing. Security guards, invitations- forget about it. I don't have it. My friends are in the party. They have all the invitations. - Call them. I don't have my phone, so... Call them. What, are you deaf, man? I just told you I don't have my phone. Sir, this is a private party. Without your invitation, there's nothing we can do for you. Don't fucking touch me, man. You know what? Forget it. If I had yourjob too, I'd be an asshole. Thanks for nothing. Fuck you. God. I can't believe they fucking left me. Well, why don't you come hang out with me at the house? I'm sure we can find something to do. I'm sure we can. All right, let's go, man. - Let's go. Come on, Beau. Get in the truck. Let's go. Beau. - Looks like he doesn't want to come. Come on, Beau. Michael: So what's in the back? Wade: It's my fireworks board. - Your what? Wade: What, didn't Ian tell you? We need the water. Fuck. We need water. Fuck. What about the bucket? Yeah. Renee, hand us the bucket. Fuck off. Thank you. That's very helpful of you. Here. Here. Renee: We have to get out of here. We can't be in here much longer. We gotta find a way out of here. I can't wait anymore. Jenna: What are we gonna do? I know what I'm gonna do. Ian: No. Renee, no. Renee, wait. - I am tired of waiting. I am sick of waiting. Wait for who? Wait for MichaeI? He's gone. Wait for Wade? He's the fuck knows where. And even the dog abandoned us. - No, no, don't. Just calm down. No, I am sick of waiting for someone. I'm the one with the life to get back to, remember? You're just poor, pathetic little Jenna with no life and no friends. Ian: Renee. Renee. Renee. Are you okay? Renee. Shit, she's out. Hey, Renee. It's okay. She's still breathing. Hey, Renee. Shit. Oh, shit. What? She's- she's clearly unconscious. But- But she's bleeding. She's gonna be okay. Let's get her away from the heater. Here, help. Jenna, help me. No. - Help me. Help me move her. Jenna, help me move her. She's gonna be all right. She'll be fine. Oh, great stuff, huh? MichaeI: Amazing. Hey, man, what did you think of the sauna? The sauna? Yeah. Oh, I forgot- I forgot I was in there. Man, I was so wasted. Jenna, are you okay? I didn't see what happened. I- I was trying to make her stop. It was an- it was an accident. I was trying to make her not break the thing. Yeah, I mean- You said- you said we would die if we broke it. You pulled her back twice. You made it seem like it was the most important thing. I- I'm so- I thought- I don't know. It's not important? What, it's not important? I should go. I'll catch up with you later, man. Here, here. - One more. One more. Beau, I'm telling you, now this- this is the life. Ian, stop. Ha ha ha! My God. Ian, stop! Ian, stop! Ian, stop! Stop! Please! Please! Please! Stop, please! Please! - Yeah! Ha! It's off, Jenna! Stop, please! Please! - It's off. Renee's voice: Jenna. Jenna. Jenna. Jenna. Jen. Jenna? Jenna. Jenna. Jenna. Renee. Renee, you're okay. You need to breathe. You need to breathe, okay? Please. Wait, wait. Hold on. Okay, okay, baby. Okay, I'm gonna get you- I'm gonna get you to the window, okay? 'Cause the gas is on, okay? You need to help me. Okay, come on, come on. Okay, all right. Renee? Ian? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Hold on, baby. Hold on. Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna get you to the window, okay? All right. Okay, okay. All right, here we go. One, two, three. Oh, God. Baby, baby. Baby. I need you to help me, okay? I need you to help me. I'm not gonna let you die in here. You hear me? I need you to help me, okay? I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay, all right. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. All right, I'm gonna put your arms through this. Okay. Okay. Ah. Still not here. Well... fuck you, guys. Hold on, okay? Okay, hold on. We're- we're- we're safe. MichaeI. What are you doing out there? I'm not babysitting your drunk ass all night. It's just- - I'm going to that party and I'm having a really good time - It's the trick floor. I'm- I'm fine. Um, bathroom. Renee: Damn it. - Ian: I'm gonna get his drunk ass. Renee: You know, he's just drunk. And I'm sick of him ruining everything again. He's just being a dick because I didn't want to sneak off for another drunken hump. Come on, we should go up. - Just give her a few minutes. No, it is hot. I want to go. What the hell happened down here? Holy shit. It had to be after midnight. I don't know. Because of the fireworks, I just- I- I'm sorry, Ian. What am I gonna tell his mother? Wade: I don't know. They were in the sauna and- I don't know.
