- [Jerry McGee] "I grew up in Monroe, North Carolina. "A friend says that makes me a country boy. "Whatever I am, I am thankful for my parents "and my teachers who left no doubt "that being an American in the 20th century "is the greatest fortune that can befall a human being." Jesse Helms wrote these words almost two decades ago, and they define in a unique way who he is and why he has become one of this century's most respected national leaders. Jesse Helms has distinguished himself as a person whose word is his bond, who lives what he says. A man who can be trusted to stand unflinchingly for the heritage of freedom. Today Wingate University honors our treasured alumnus for his ongoing work in public service as a defender of our freedom and our traditions. We honor him too for his dedication to those he is sworn to serve in this state and throughout our nation. Wingate University confers upon Jesse Helms the honorary degree Doctor of Laws. (audience applauding) - [Tim] Dear Jesse, For a long time, I thought we had nothing in common, but I realize now that I was wrong. Like you, I was born in Monroe, North Carolina. I grew up about three miles from there in a town called Wingate, the home of Wingate University, a school you and I both attended for one year each before transferring to other universities. Like you, I grew up attending a Southern Baptist church and also like you, one of my first jobs was working as a radio announcer. In high school, we both expressed an interest in journalism. You wrote for the Monroe Enquirer Journal. I was editor of my high school newspaper. But, I believe we have a more significant similarity. For most of your 24 years in the United States Senate, you've been obsessed with homosexual men. For most of my adult life, so have I. (gentle guitar music) - Whatever they do, they do at home. Don't go out in the street and flout it. But, these people who are making an issue of it and demanding rights that no other American has, they can take a leave and gone as far as I'm concerned because I don't think they are entitled to one right, not one that other Americans do not enjoy. - [Tim] I left North Carolina in 1990, two weeks after graduating from college and moved to New York City where I've lived ever since. Now, when I look back, I see that I ran away. Maybe I thought New York would protect me from the anti-gay message you send to my family and friends back home, a message that calls me evil, immoral, dangerous. As a result, I've stayed as far away from North Carolina as possible. But, even in New York, whenever I tell someone I'm from North Carolina, they mention you. The name Jesse Helms seems synonymous with the state. Anyway, the winter of 1996 was tough. New York was bitter cold. My boyfriend, Joe, broke up with me, and then you announced that you were seeking a 5th term in the Senate. That was when I got really depressed. (siren blaring) The writer Thomas Wolfe, who was also from North Carolina, said, "You can't go home again," but that's all I really wanted to do. So, I sublet my apartment, took some time off from work and I left New York. When I got to North Carolina, I decided to borrow my dad's truck and hit the road. I wanted to visit some old friends. I wanted to find people who hadn't run away. I wanted to see for myself if Thomas Wolfe was right. ♪ Man of the Lord ♪ ♪ Man of the wine ♪ ♪ A cutter of shades for the desperate kind ♪ ♪ Man of the world ♪ ♪ The coming and the going of men ♪ ♪ Met the Devil in Charleston now he's drinking again ♪ ♪ Evil in the barn ♪ ♪ Livestock laying on the ground ♪ ♪ A sure fire sign that Satan is around ♪ ♪ Devil in the world ♪ ♪ Grindstaff needs him a bride ♪ ♪ Fevering my handle in mine ♪ ♪ Now sakes alive ♪ ♪ Welcome to the plowshare ♪ ♪ Of New Canaan ♪ ♪ Take me home ♪ ♪ Welcome to the plowshare ♪ ♪ Of New Canaan ♪ ♪ Take me home ♪ (gentle guitar music) - [Tim] This is where I grew up, Wingate, North Carolina, population 2,829. That's including about 1,200 college students. Wingate reminds me of Mayberry from the Andy Griffith Show, a place where everyone knows everyone else. Once there was even a barber named Floyd, but he quit cutting hair to become a preacher. The railroad runs right through the center of town. I always felt safe in Wingate, and there was a strong sense of community. In the winter, if it snowed, people from all over town gathered at the top of the hill in front of our house to sled. Like Senator Helms, I have one brother and one sister. That's me on the far right. On Halloween, Mom and Dad would dress us up in costumes and take us to the haunted house sponsored by the Wingate Jaycees and Jaycettes. It was really just a big abandoned house in the middle of town. My brother and sister would always go inside with my dad while I stood outside with my mom crying, terrified even to step upon the porch. I'm still scared to go inside that house. Actually, when I finally got up the nerve to go inside with my camera, the people who work there didn't thing it would be a good idea. - [Man] I wish I could be more helpful, but I'm just not comfortable with it. I can't be part of that, you know, and I can't take a chance on bein' part of it. My job's on the line. You've got to understand, you know? I've got a board of directors and they're not going to be happy if I cooperate in that kind of thing. - [Tim] Sure. - [Myron] I've always found Senator Helms to be very personable and very friendly and very open. And I think he's a fine person, and I have a lot of respect for him. - [Tim] My friend Myron is a proud Republican and ardent Jesse Helms supporter. I've known Myron all my life. He lives right around the corner from the Jesse Helms Center. I thought maybe he could tell me about the place. - Jog by every morning, when I take my morning jog, and they fixed up an old house in Wingate and it really looks good, and it's got his papers there and a replica of his office in Washington DC with memorabilia. They have the Jesse Helms Lecture Series, which I was talking with someone over at the Helms Center the other day, and I told him that I had perfect attendance. I've been to all the lectures. Had Henry Kissinger and Dalai Lama, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Steve Forbes, and then, of course, they had Bob Dole for graduation last year and Dan Quayle for graduation at Wingate University this year. - [Dan Quayle] Now, this is not going to be a political speech, but I want everyone to know that I will do anything, whatever it takes to make sure that Jesse Helms goes back to that Senate. I just can't imagine the Senate without Jesse Helms. - [Tim] We may have been born in the same town, but we were raised in totally different worlds. Jesse Helms grew up in a racially-segregated Monroe in the 1920s and '30s. He dropped out of college to work as a news reporter. And during World War II, worked as a Navy recruiter and radio announcer. In 1950, Helms supported Willis Smith, a conservative candidate in a Senate campaign still considered to be one of the meanest and most racially divisive in the country's history. Smith's victory landed Helms a job as staff administrative assistant until 1953 when he returned to Raleigh to head North Carolina's Banking Association. In Raleigh, Helms served on the city council. And in 1960, took a job as a TV commentator attacking racial integration, the media, homosexuality and welfare. In 1972, Helms won his first election to the US Senate where he has become well-known for his conservative stands on issues such as affirmative action, funding of the arts, abortion rights and the separation of church and state. While I was home, I got a chance to attend one of my favorite springtime activities, the Blooming Arts Festival, an annual street fair in Downtown Monroe. Since North Carolina is home to several military bases, I wasn't surprised to spot a man in uniform. - I'm Shane Webster. Military history, I served a few years in the Army, a few years in the Navy, and now I'm in the North Carolina National Guard. I got four years in on a six-year hitch. - [Tim] What are you doing today? - Today, I'm kind of between booths today. I work with White Rock Studio in Matthews doing these handmade clay sculptures. And I also work with the National Guard, who also happens to have a booth in the same show, so I'm kind of running between booths. - [Tim] Usually when I spot someone in a uniform, I run the other way. But, the more I talked to Shane, the more I liked him. - I had the privilege of growing up in Monroe with the Senator, and he was a good friend of the family. And knowing him personally, I'm not as impressed by him as some people would be, or appalled by him either, as some people would be. I know him on a personal level. We don't go golfin' and things like that, but I do know who he is, and I've had some experience with him in the past. And I'm middle-of-the-road more of the fact that I know his history and I know his past here in Monroe. And some of it is questionable, and I don't like some of it. And some of the things he says now are upsetting, and don't like some of those. But, that doesn't change the fact that I can trust him. That's the important thing. He is a political figure that I can trust, and that's rare. It's rare among most human beings, and it's exceptionally rare among politicians and lawyers. So, when you finally get one you can trust, you like to hang onto him, and that's why people like him. And that's why I'm middle-of-the-road just because I don't agree with 100% of what he says. I have an intelligent mind and I can make up my own mind about what I want to say and do. - [Tim] Shane and I had a nice chat, but I can't help but wonder how he might have reacted if he knew I was gay, or maybe he did know. Whatever the case, he never asked, and I didn't tell. Sometimes I feel as if I live in two worlds, one in New York where I'm totally out of the closet, and one here where I find myself going back in. One place where I knew I could be myself was at my college reunion at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. - [Mary] How you doin'? Hey Richard. - Hey, there. - [Mary] You hear any good things about me? - Yeah. - What'd you hear? - I heard that you got a new job. - [Mary] Oh, thank you God. I got a new job. - That's great. Congratulations. - [Mary] Hey, what are you doin' here? - [Richard] This is my friend Ralph. - [Mary] Hey, it's nice to meet you. - [Tim] Tim, hey Ralph. Good to meet you. Like a lot of gay people, I chose to come out first to my closest friends. It's safer because the possibility of being rejected by a friend is less painful than the possibility of being rejected by your family. He saved us. There they are. - [Amy] There he is. - [Amy] Hi, honey. - [Laura] Sweetie! - Hey, I've missed you so much. - [Laura] Oh, my god. I don't want to let go of you. - How you doin'? - I'm good. How are you? - It's good to see you. (talking and chattering) While I was in school, these friends became like a family to me. And like most families, they sometimes told me things I wasn't quite ready to hear. - [Brady] Tell the story. - [Amy] Oh, okay. Well, I just think it's-- - [Brady] I'm here for color. - Important that I was the first person to tell Tim he was gay. He came downstairs and on Park Avenue and Andrea and I were on the porch. And Tim came prancin' down. He was talkin' about baked potatoes or something and wantin' us to eat baked potatoes. - [Andrea] Or popcorn. or he might have smelled popcorn and just came down involuntarily. He couldn't help it. And so, he was prancing and I said, "You are gay." (laughing) And then he goes, "I am not." Like you remember seein' him at school and goin', "Gay." (laughing) Screaming it like, "Gay!" So gay. And then, you denied it for about two years. (laughing) - [Chris] Till you moved to that city. - [Brady] No, there was just a time where Tim just all of a sudden disappeared. The next time we knew it, he had moved to New York. And I went to visit, and all of a sudden, I found Tim a happier man. A whole different person than the one I met. - [Laura] 'Cause Tim found Tim. - [Liza] Tim found Tim. - [Tim] Oh god, let's not go down that path. (laughing) - None of this explains his lack of ability to organize his apartment. There's just no organization. There's no interior design. You fall outside of every stereotype of a gay man ever. It's no wonder it took us so long. (laughing) - [Liza] So long to figure out. (gentle guitar music) - [Tim] It was great to be home, but often I found myself thinking about Joe back in New York wishing things had worked out between us. I'd heard he was close to landing a role in a new Broadway musical called Rent. Joe once told me that all he ever really wanted was to be an actor. As a child, I got involved in local theater for a while. I remember what a thrill it was to go onstage and become someone else, even for a couple of hours. - Backstage, opening night, it was a musical called Irene. Do you remember? Oh, you probably don't remember that musical. But, they had a lot of young, wonderful actors from New York. It was up in Virginia, Roanoke, Virginia. And just as, you know how you hug everybody and hug, you know? "Have a good show," and this kind of thing. And these two young men just kissed each other very passionately right in front of me. Well, this was, I had never seen that in my life, and it absolutely, I just stood there like this little child with my mouth open. But, you know, both those young men I had come to know in rehearsal. I had taken them to their first cafeteria, and they went crazy, all that food. We were all so hungry. We'd been rehearsing. And I didn't think of them as different in any way. But, that was new, but it didn't, it didn't make any difference to me, you know? The love was already there. The love was already there. My cousin Ann is an actress. I've always felt close to her. Ann was the first family member I came out to, and has been incredibly supportive. When I stopped by her house in Charlotte, Ann remembered the day I told I was moving to New York. - Mm-hmm, I was scared to death. - I didn't know that. - Scared to death, Because you seemed so innocent. You know, you seemed so innocent. - (laughing) I was! - And so naive, and I was so afraid for you. - It was the best thing for me. - Oh, I know, I knew that. I knew that. That's where you were going to find something that you've never known, artistically. That was where you were going to live out something in you that had to be lived out. I found it myself. - In New York? - The first time, I was 50 years I went the first time to New York. Didn't know anybody. Went to an actors' studio and those great actors, and I was just terrified, absolutely, at 50 years old. - [Tim] Ann told me that recently a theater company in Charlotte had been under fire over a production of the Pulitzer-prize-winning Angels in America, a compassionate play about homosexuality and the AIDS crisis. - You have to read between the lines to find out that this apparently is a homosexual thing, and because the homosexuals are promoting it and so forth. But, I don't see any point in a naked man cavorting around on the stage. - [Tim] Ann's friend, Steve Umberger, was the director. - We were in rehearsal. I actually didn't know of it firsthand 'cause we were in rehearsal and I kept hearing all these media reports. But, basically what happened was that Reverend Joe Chambers got wind of the play. - There's two things very clearly in this that is against the law according to the way I understand it. One is total nudity, and the other is any simulated sex acts. Those are contrary to the obscenity laws in the state of North Carolina. - He, of course, objected to it on the grounds of, technically, on the grounds of the nudity that's in the exam scene in one scene in the play. But, also on the grounds of the homosexuality. - It's time for the decent God-fearing people, and I've heard the Lord's name used many times tonight, of this community to quit playing dead. - We came down to six o'clock on the night of the first audience, not sure whether we were going to play the play or not. And actually, what we had said to ourselves was, "If the arrest has to happen, so be it." That is was a statement that needed to be made. So, we did it. One of my favorite editorials about this whole thing came from somebody who said, you know, "My taxes go to support lots of things "that I don't necessarily support." But, that is part of living in a community. It's a very conservative town. It's a very religion town. It's a town of banks and churches, not necessarily in that order, you know. And I think there's a real quality of life that people want to preserve. And I think they don't necessarily realize that preserving it does not mean eliminating certain lifestyles and certain elements from the canvas. - Well, when I came out, it was like it is for a lot of families. It was difficult for all of my family members, some in particular, to come to grips of having a gay person in the family and to learn what being gay really meant and what it wasn't. To learn what the truth was and demystify homosexuality. But, my family's grown a lot. They're extremely supportive. - [Tim] A lot has changed since I left. People are not only talking about homosexuality, they're living openly gay lives, something I never imagined when I lived here. I wish I'd known someone like Mike Nelson when I was growing up. He's North Carolina's first openly gay mayor. - Being gay really hasn't affected negatively my ability to be a good mayor, or even how people view me as mayor. Most people in town are concerned with road issues or garbage collection or where street lights go, where street lights don't go. Or can their kid get into the town baseball program. And being gay just doesn't matter to them. If anything, for a lot of voters, it's... it's... they like it. They like living in a progressive town that would elect a gay person mayor. There have been a couple of negative incidents. We have an elderly gentlemen in town who has very strong religious views who has come to our board meetings I think three times, and damned us all to hell. And "The gay people are leading this town to hell." And "You all are all whoremongers," he said. It was, there were a couple of difficult incidents to sit there, not because necessarily 'cause they were painful, but it's awful hard not to laugh when someone calls you a whoremonger. (laughing) - [Tim] Tell me the story about the White House again. - Well, it was a group of lesbian and gay elected officials from across the country. I think about 100 of us. And as we were entering the White House, there was guardhouse, I guess. And as we were waiting, a group of the guards put on blue plastic gloves because they were apparently, afraid to touch us. Afraid that they would contract HIV. And it created a bit of an uproar for a few days nationally. Got a lot of press attention. The President apologized. The Vice President apologized first, and then the President wrote us, each of us, a letter apologizing. - [Tim] Why do you think people continue to support Helms? - Well, as I said, Jesse Helms is a brilliant, brilliant politician, and more than any other North Carolina politician, he knows how to use, to manipulate people and whip people up into a frenzy so that they vote based on their emotions and on their gut, on their prejudices rather than on their reasoning and their intellect. And I don't know if admire is the right word. Certainly respect isn't the right word, but as a politician, I admire someone who can do that. He is absolutely brilliant. I wish he had chosen to use that ability to do good in the world rather than to cause problems and to destroy people. I mean, I think Jesse Helms is an evil man, and he has chosen to use gay people as his tool to whip people up into a frenzy. Somewhere in Jesse's life, he had the choice which path to go down and he chose I think the wrong path. - [Tim] What about gay marriage? - Oh, I can't wait to get married. (laughing) I'll be on that first plane to Honolulu. (gentle guitar music) - [Tim] Suddenly, the whole country was talking about whether or not gay people should be able to get married, particularly in Hawaii where legislation was pending. Same-sex marriages aren't legal anywhere in the United States, and North Carolina is no exception. My friends Susan and Ruth live in Charlotte. Last year, they decided to have a wedding anyway. - [Susan] Let's see, we met two years ago exactly. - [Ruth] In June. - [Susan] Yeah, in June two years ago. So, three months later, we were quite interesting in one another. (laughing) and then, a year after that, last December 30th we were married. - [Tim] What made you decide to do that? - I asked her. (laughing) - [Ruth] I think because at some point, you realize that the journey that you have been on all these years and the hard work you put into feeling good about who you are, you finally take a rightful place with the rituals that society says are important in supporting relationships. And marriage is the ultimate expression of commitment and love between two people that our society recognizes. And we need the support of our community, our family and friends, just the way all other heterosexual couples get it automatically. We have to beg for it. We have to cry for it, and finally we have to claim it. And I think that's what the gay people are doing these days. Through commitment ceremonies and services, we're finally saying, "Look, we are okay. "We feel good about who we are. "Now, it's your turn, you know? "Help us along and support us." - Plus, it helped my family. They had a hard time in the beginning with our relationship. And I have a daughter that's 22, and I was married for over 22 years. And it helped her to understand. She could understand what a marriage was. And so, when I told her that I had asked Ruth to marry me, then she understood what this commitment was. It wasn't just living together. It wasn't just going to be a passing thing. It was a permanent relationship, and that's when she came around and began to accept it as that and began to give it validity. And then, at our ceremony, the majority of my family was there. My ex-husband came. His new wife came. All my former in-laws came. And for most of them, that was the first acknowledgement of a gay relationship that they publicly made. And so, that was the whole reason in doing it publicly. - [Ruth] In a campaign, you have to go where you can get the most money, and you have to say that those people want to give you the money want to hear. And I think that's all his campaigns have even been about is doing what it takes to win. - The real issue is that he takes a minority and uses them, and makes the majority feel like if they give a donation, then they're going to somehow be able to stop what's goin' on in the minority. But, the minority will eventually get their rights. - Jesse Helms is such a disappointment for North Carolina. No, he doesn't represent me, and he doesn't represent many people that I know, but he does represent big money and tobacco. - He can listen to the tobacco lobby that kills people, but he can't listen to two people who just love one another. - You know, it's not about legislating people to like us about who we are for being gay or being black. It's whether you can legislate to make sure no one can lynch you or no one can take away your fundamental rights, and that's what we're really talking about. But, if you think about being gay, we're already here. You know, a lot of us can't be out for whatever reason, but we're already here. But, when you hear someone say, "And the only reason why I'm takin' that job away," or, "The only reason why I'm takin' those kids away," like Sharon Bottoms in Virginia was because she's a lesbian. No other reason, no other rationale. And I've heard, "And the only reason "why we don't want you here, the only reason why "is because you have black skin." I mean what the heck is the difference? A prejudice is a prejudice, and there's some amazingly emotional feeling of your less than, you're not worthy. It's just, I mean, I've been on the receiving end of both those, and I'm tellin' you, it feels exactly the same. - [Tim] For many years, Mandy Carter has been a civil rights activist. When I met Mandy, she was heading up Mobilization 96, a gay and lesbian group formed to support Harvey Gantt, the Democratic candidate in the senate race against Jesse Helms. - Hey Joe, it's Mandy Carter calling from Mobe 96, callin' you about quarter to 12 on Wednesday. I wanted to let you know that tomorrow evening, there's going to be a panel over at UNC-Chapel Hill around the arts censorship and this exhibit that's in town about gay and lesbian parents and their children. (talking and chattering) And what the heck does family in 1996 anyway? What is the typical family in this society? It's not typical anymore. Right now... I'm 47 years old and I'm thinking about my lesbian friends, and it's just really interesting. There's a baby boom going on in the lesbian community. (laughing) And I think there's a reason why. This is part of my rationale. What they perceive to be a family. You know, a lot of lesbians have cats. (laughing) Why would they have cats? 'Cause they have a lot of love to share. And what's happening is that a lot of lesbians my age are thinking, "There's more to love than our home. "We need to share that with someone else "beyond just us." I will tell you that the greatest gift that the voters of North Carolina can deliver to this country and throughout this world because of his position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to bring Jesse home. And I will tell you that I think one of the ways that we do really spread the word across the state of North Carolina is because we're going to be talking to our families, our members because they might say, "I don't care. "It doesn't have anything to do with me usually." But, when someone in your family directly connected with it, then I think we've heard people say, "Tim, can I share your story?" When a mom says, "I don't think I know anyone gay," and the gay son comes out to her and says, "Wait a minute, now you're talking about my son. "Now you're talking about someone I care about." And it's got to make a profound difference. And I think the power of families around the state of North Carolina could really make a big difference. And I quite frankly think I predict we win this one. I really do. I have to otherwise I'm wasting my time. (laughing) You know what I'm saying? But the power of love can transcend the hate. - [Tim] Dear Jesse, Some people say gays and lesbians can't settle down, that we're a threat to the family, that we're demanding special rights. Then, when we want to get married to embrace the very institutions set up to represent monogamy, fidelity and commitment, it's denied to us. All this talk about marriage made me think about my future which made me think again about Joe. This is my family. There's Dad with my nephew Kyle. That's my sister Jan and her husband Forrest. That's Justin, their son. There's Mom. That's my brother Bill and his wife Lesa who was pregnant at the time. My parents have been married over 40 years. Both my brother and sister were adopted before I was born. Something else I learned our families have in common, Senator Helms. I learned how you'd read a newspaper article on Christmas Day about a boy with cerebral palsy who'd said all he wanted was a mom and dad, and how you and your wife had adopted him. - A family to me is more about love and guidance and a bond that that group of people share because they truly care about each other, not because of the genes or a family bloodline, family tree, anything like that. But, just the true, genuine caring about each other and caring about mankind. And that's where I'm from. I truly do hope that I can do some little part and make this place a better place. And if that means adopting a child that's HIV positive that needs to be loved just as much as any kid that's born under not-normal circumstances, then that's what I'll do. I'm committed to that kind of thing. Watch you shoot water. - Let's go down to where that-- - Cemetery is? - [Boy] No, down there where that pond is. - [Tim] My friend Karen and her son Ross have what some might call a non-traditional family. Karen isn't married, but she's always wanted a family. So, like my own parents and like Senator Helms, Karen has created her family in part through adoption. - Follow Ross. - I got a phone call back in January of '92, and excuse me, '93, and I went over to the Children's Home Society and they started telling me about an infant. They didn't even mention the sex at that time, just tellin' me the age and the health problems and family history and things like that. And then, they showed me a picture and asked me, "How would you feel about "adopting this little boy?" And of course, my answer was yes even before I saw him. Ross had a lot of things goin' against him at the time he was born because his mother not only had the HIV virus, but she also had just about every other sexually-transmitted disease that a young woman can have. And it's just a miracle that he able to be born naturally without any deformities or mental retardation or anything like that. His mother is white. His father is a black American. Both of his parents are HIV positive... were HIV positive. He was born I guess carryin' his mother's antibodies, but basically that's what when he developed his own immune system, he was free of the HIV virus. Over time, he has converted, so that was another miracle. A few water snakes. - There's a lot of water in there. Look, he's goin' swimmin' for it. - When I was tryin' to find a church for us to attend, and I thought I found one that was a fairly decent church to go to, and I had to take him out of church one day because he was bein' a little louder than he needed to be. And I was just sittin' holdin' him and talkin' to him, and I remember a little kid comin' out of the nursery class. Boy couldn't have been more than maybe four years old himself, and he looked at me and he said, "Who's his mother?" And I said, "I'm his mother." He said, "You can't be his mother." I said, "Why can't I be his mother?" He said, "Because you're a white woman "and that's a little black boy." And that four-year-old didn't sit and think that up on his own. And I realized then that those nice Baptists that were sittin' in those pews right across the way there were every week bein' irritated because here was this single mom comin' in with this little mixed boy. And I hope that Ross will be one of the cornerstones in changing the way the world views ourselves as mankind. You know, he's of mixed race. I've got the best of both worlds, and I hope that's what he'll see. I don't want him to see himself as particularly a white male or a black male, but as a young man that can contribute to this world. I want him to grow up to be a strong and gentle man. Everyone can't have a biological mother and father. That's just not feasible. In Ross' case, I doubt seriously his parents are even alive now. I answer all his questions. I tell him, you know, that he was a special gift to me, and I tell him about the day that I met him and the day I picked him up. And all the things that go on between us. Sometimes we just sit and he says, "Tell me the story about when you came to get me." So, you know, it's something that we talk about. (gentle guitar music) - [Tim] A few days before the May primary elections, I stopped by Smithfield, North Carolina, home of the Ham and Yam Festival. I was hungry for some nice, tasty yams, but the ones I found were not edible. - [Woman] Are you from around here? - I grew up in, I grew up near Charlotte. - [Woman] Ah. - But, I live in New York City. You know, we're down here makin' a film about North Carolina politics. (laughing) - Can I give you a tip? - Yeah. - I think the one thing that bothers me and a lot of my friends and the people in, just everybody I know really, is that it seems to be one extreme or the other. It's like you're either an extreme right or an extreme left. In politics, there seems to be too much black and white. I want to see people, you know, in the middle. Can you smile for me? Does that make sense? I think I got you. - Yeah? - [Woman] What's your name? Do you want me to write your name on there? - Yeah, Tim. - Vote Democratic, the ass you save may be your own. And on the back we've got Democrats, a new generation of leadership to highlight the new generation of Democrats that Bill Clinton and Al Gore personify. And we are the Young Democratic Organization designed to create future leaders for the Democratic Party both locally and statewide. - [Tim] And do you think it's possible to beat Jesse Helms? - Yes, I do. Jesse Helms is ripe for the plucking. People are tired of his negative campaign. They're tired of his one-issue campaigns on abortion and affirmative action, and they're ready to see a person in the United States Senate that they can be proud of, not somebody they turn away from. - [Tim] And why do you think people supported him for so long in this state? - Because he has played upon fear and prejudice and he is about the politics of division, not about the politics of unity. - You know, the interesting thing about Helms is Helms is a controversial individual, but he's also a very open individual about his beliefs and what he stands for. And you don't have to necessarily agree for him, but I think people really appreciate knowing where someone always stands. They can say, "This is where his, "these are his issues and these are where he stands," and he doesn't really deviate from that. And that's, I think, maybe a little different than you ordinarily see in a political kind of person. - [Tim] So, are you old enough to vote? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I'm 17. I'm 18 in June so-- - Yeah, so what got you involved in the Republican Party? - My parents are Democrats. - [Woman] They have to respect Jesse in some ways. He's good representative in the sense that he no matter who are for the most part, if you call his office, someone will call you back. You won't just get a form letter. They'll call you back. - [Female] They stink. All they think about is themselves. And you know a Republican 'cause they always have big bucks. You ever notice that? - I think people are tired of wasteful government. Tired of having their money just thrown at problems and money can't just can't solve things by itself. You have to have responsible government. - [Man] We all have basic needs. We need food, clothing and shelter. You know and then basically beyond a certain amount, it's "wants" and that's what I say right now. We've gotta first meet our needs and not our "wants." - [Female] Well, I'm sorry. If you have two kids, you cannot live on minimum wage. - [Woman] Well, I think it comes down to, you know, what we're about as a country whether it be abortion or whether it be gay rights or any of those things. You know, our country is based on freedom, or it's supposed to be. - I guess the big talk is Jesse Helms is the commencement speaker at the College of Business at ASU. The students are protesting and they say if he speaks, they will march. If you do a piece on politics, that would be an interesting place to be, I bet. (gentle instrumental music) - [Tim] A student boycott of Jesse Helms seemed like a good reason to visit North Carolina Mountains. I wanted to find out what was going on, so I spoke with Angela Brady, editor of the student newspaper at ASU. - Appalachian has, their big push has been for diversity. People were thinking that Jesse Helms was the antithesis of the whole diversity movement while the other side was thinkin' that if you're going to have Bell Hooks and Anita Hill, you know, liberal speakers, you should have Jesse Helms representing the conservative side as well. Their main concern was that he was invited during commencement where people would have to sit and listen to him, and it wouldn't be an open forum. There would be no questions allowed. And they were concerned that it would be a political speech because it's an election year. - We had 500 signatures on the petition which basically said that we diametrically oppose Helms coming to speak at commencement. When we wrote this letter, we had 19 different groups who wanted to be a part of the letter and cosign it. - [Tim] In his letter to the Chancellor, Senator Helms declined the invitation to speak at commencement claiming that he didn't want to be the target of what he called national groups which promote homosexuality. Helms claimed that the groups had no affiliation with the university, and he never acknowledged the 500 student signatures or the 19 different student groups who opposed his appearance. - Actually, I wear this letter as a badge of honor. I think that it was one of the greatest successes for the university and for the students. Hopefully in the future, we'll do the same thing. - [Tim] Andrew George led the protest and called it a victory. But, who really won? - Jesse Helms is one of the nicest, most gentle people I have ever met. Sometimes I think that Senator Helms would win by 52% if he were runnin' against Billy Graham. (laughing) - [Tim] Senator Helms often accuses the media of having a liberal bias. So, I went out looking for a conservative journalist to speak with. I asked around and located Gene Price, a semi-retired newspaper editor in Goldsboro. - We have going after Helms everyday a mean-spirited press. They look for anything and everything negative that they can produce that will reflect adversely on Jesse Helms. About a year ago, a year or so ago, when a Washington reporter Mr. Rosen for the Raleigh News and Observer was interviewing Senator Helms. In the course of the interview, and in jest, Helms made the comment that should President Clinton come to a military base in North Carolina, he'd better bring with him a bodyguard. Well, Senator Helms did not mean that literally. Mr. Rosen placed it next to the last paragraph, I believe, on an in-depth story. Ironically, the next day, one of the wire services in Washington DC picked up that little tidbit and all of a sudden it was an international story and the News Observer streamered it on page one. - [Tim] I asked Mr. Price to tell me why he supports Senator Helms. - Number one, you know very well where he stands, although you may disagree with him. He is... ...above all else he is completely honest. He lets you know his position without hesitation. He excels in the area of constituent service. Um... Um... He's good, I think for... ...free enterprise system. And its ability to keep going. I think you can be a conservative and an environmentalist without being a damn fool. - [Tim] Mr. Price was one of the few people I met who would go on camera in support of Jesse Helms. It was as if they were in the closet about it. I know how that is. Several years ago, I told my parents that I'm gay. It was difficult for all of us, and as a result, I'm reluctant to share certain parts of my life with them. I hadn't told them about Joe, so they couldn't comfort me about our breakup. It seems wrong not to share this with my family, but I'm just not sure what they want to hear, or even what I want to say. What I do know is that my silence ensures that they never see me as a whole person. And if they never know the part of me that loves, the part they taught me to respect, honor and cherish by their own example, can they ever really know me? On the day of the state primary elections, I was back in Monroe. I stopped by one of the city precincts and ran into my old junior high school principal, Mr. McAfee. - It's going to be very difficult to unseat Mr. Helms. - [Tim] What is it going to take? - Maybe death. (laughing) I shouldn't, cut. (laughing) It's very difficult to-- The man has money. He has experience. A lot of people know him. - [Tim] Do you think that race is going to be an issue? - Well, you know naturally, yes. I think so. And as I say, I feel that it's time for a change. But, you know, even people get into office and they become, they may be doing a fairly good job. But, they become complacent and decide, "Well, I don't have to worry about anything. "I'll be back." And so, sometimes it's good to have a new breed to move in and try to do something different. Of course, sometimes we're afraid of changes and sometimes this is what happens. We know what we got, but we don't know what we're going to get and this makes a difference. - [Tim] So, do the clapper. (clapping) I'm standing in front of Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, one of the many voting precincts for today's primary elections. Today, voters in North Carolina decide who faces Jesse Helms in the November elections. (gentle guitar music) Steve Umberger, the theater director, was right. Charlotte is a town of banks and churches. And Shane, the guy in the National Guard, he told me all the banks around here try to look like churches. Religion is important in the South, especially here. It was a big part of my life growing up. When I turned 18, I registered to vote as a Republican. I was a senior in high school, and that year, I voted for Jesse Helms. A few years later, someone asked me why I did that. I remember saying, "I voted for Jesse Helms "because he believes in God." Not far from Calvary Church, my friend Andrea took me to another church, her favorite one in Charlotte. She said when she lived here, she used to drive by it all the time, admiring its quiet beauty. Most of the members of this congregation are African-American and a few days after we took these pictures, the church burned to the ground. One of the first of many church-burnings in the South that spring. - Anyone who can be so mean-spirited, who has so much venom for anyone who is different must be a monster, must have some incredible power that can eat up a little girl, a little colored girl growing up in the Piedmont of North Carolina. - [Tim] Jaki Shelton Green was one of the first students integrated into the North Carolina public school system. In 1990, Jaki was asked to write a poem as part of a fundraiser for Harvey Gantt, the state's first African-American senatorial candidate. I met Jaki in Efland, North Carolina. - I grew up in Efland. And one of the things that stands out just most vividly in my mind is every night after, I guess, the six o'clock news, Jesse Helms would appear on channel five. For my family, it was as much a part of ritual as washing the dishes, you know, having family dinner, doing homework. That was the time when you listened to Jesse. And I realize now that the power of my family wanting us to listen was really, I compare it to being in the militia, that one must know their enemy. So, as a very young girl, I realized, I really believed this man was extraordinarily powerful. And then, I would remember the conversations of the elders and people in my community who were just utterly in awe in a very despicable way of this person who could just cast this bad energy night after night after night. When it was time to write a piece, it was not about Harvey Gantt that I wrote a piece about, but I went into my bedroom and I locked the door. And actually, I'm now remembering, I wrote this poem on my knees. And somewhere, I realized it was a prayer. So, that's what this piece is all about. It's called Prayer for Jesse. "I will smear blood under your eyes, "stand in the same dream with you. "Hear your secret screams. "I will watch the light pump your heart "and worship whatever dream that swallows you. "Your silence will not protect you "for I have declared war." And the words just flowed. And for me, it was really an exorcism because all of those years of watching this man on TV, I realized I needed to get rid of the fright. And I know and I knew I needed to release it to let go of it, to disperse of it and to dismantle this power that in so many ways was a part of my life, and it wasn't a very positive part of my life. I think he's afraid of his own humanness. And I think until he is able to be in touch with his own humanness that I'm not sure if he can embrace a humanity of one people. And when I say one people, I mean one people in terms of doing the right thing. You know, one people that says hunger is sinful, and it's ugly, that racism is ugly. That sexism and ageism and all the -isms that plague us, it's just bad. It's ugly and it's not religious and it's not Christian. It defies everything he thinks he has up in his moral fiber. "Grandma said, 'You better read the 27 Psalms "'for nine mornings in a row.' "Yeah, you need to come by here "and listen to the slaves crying "and dance in their lynching light. "You ought to get to the altar and speak in tongues." - The arts are an expression of the self, and the self is always radical. (laughing) You know, and I mean, it is to... understand your own story is in many ways to not be willing to be herded along. And I think that that's true. I think... also just on a, you know, a dumb level, he just thinks the arts are a waste of money because he doesn't have a clue what they're about because I don't think he is perhaps capable of understanding things in those ways. And I think that's a loss. (gentle guitar music) - [Tim] Lee Smith is one of North Carolina's many great writers, and also one of the best teachers I've ever had. Lee is married to Hal Crowther, a political writer and columnist. I went to visit them at their home in Chapel Hill. - The arts, I think reading and writing and literature, expose us to humanity in all kinds of forms that we don't always get in our own families, you know, and in our own closed little worlds. And certainly for me, that was true. I mean, myself personally growin' up. But, I think that's another thing that makes me feel so strongly that the arts have a place in education at every level. It's so good for our self-esteem. It's so helpful in figuring out the world and to my mind, that's one of the things I resent most about Senator Helms is his opposition to the arts. - What Jesse represents, which is a certain kind of ignorance and repression, everyone encounters it according to their own interests, their own obsession, their own particular. You know, in your case, apparently the arts. But, you know, if you're someone, for instance, who's involved with the foreign missions and, you know, people in the foreign service and the State Department, so you're encountering him on the level of primitive Cold War. And he's the worst in the United States for this ancient idea of, you know, Them and Us that's caused us so much trouble. But, you know, the central thing, I think is race. You have to understand that this state had Jim Crow 30 years ago, and there's an awful lot of adults walking around right now who liked it very much and were very comfortable, a lot of white people. And a lot of the talk radio phenomenon has to do with telling people who have dreadful prejudices and selfish, vicious politics that really they're good Americans. And they can't wait to hear someone fairly articulate, someone in position of authority, someone on the radio, a politician, telling 'em, "No, you're not a mean-spirited son of a bitch. "You're a real American like me." - One thing people are very wary of is outsiders comin' in and tryin' to tell 'em what to think. And Jesse, this is something that Jesse really plays on. And it's really true with the talk radio too because these guys on talk radio sound like somebody you know. You know, whereas, the people on NPR have weird names and British accents, and you feel like they're talkin' down to you. Hell, I feel like they're talkin' down to me. And I, you know and I resent-- - They are. - They are, yeah, that's right. And I, you know, and I resent that. And so, this is one of the big reasons why people want to be, they want to be reaffirmed rather than challenged. - There are three different kinds of people who vote for him. You know, there are the people who are really cynical, who understand exactly what they're doing, you know, understand what he stands for and they like it and they're not ashamed of it. And there are the other people who really are being fooled, the poor white people who don't understand that they're voting for somebody who represents rich people and big corporations and always votes in their favor and does nothing for poor white people, but he plays the race card for their vote and also the anti-gay card, the misogynous card. All those easy cards in North Carolina. But, they get nothing out of it. And the other group is the one I was talking to you about before, the people who just don't get it. They recognize and they understand that he's a figure, that he's someone they've seen on television. They've seen his face on telephone pole. And they vote for him simply out of familiarity which is a much bigger factor than any of us would like to think in politics. - Well, somebody, I think maybe it was Pat Conroy who said that the whole South runs on denial. I feel like I learned more about life from literature than from life! (laughing) - At first, you think of Helms as a kind of caricature of everything that most embarrasses you about being a North Carolinian. And then, slowly you come back to the notion that there are many qualities that are admirable in this man, and many qualities that one shares with him. He believes in hard work, and so do I. He is immensely proud of the state, and so am I. He does what he says he'll do, and so do I try to do that. But, there's a certain juncture where we divide paths. There's a certain way in which having been beaten as a child, you either decide to take up the stick yourself or to take the stick out of the hands of the people who are beating other people and say, "This is no longer possible. "This will not do." (gentle instrumental music) - [Tim] Lee Smith thought I should meet Allan Gurganus, the author of Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All. Allan grew up in North Carolina, but he also lived in New York for a while. Like Jaki, Allan remembers Jesse Helms' nightly TV commentaries from the 1960s. - What I remember most is the shape of his face which was like a fist. It was bunched and tense and judgmental and negative and as children, we naturally thought it was funny. His views were announced with kind of this stutter sputtering. He seemed to have a slight paralysis, so he spoke out of one side of his mouth. And his hatred of the black people who were then trying to make themselves felt and find a place in the culture was palpable. He referred to DOCTOR... Martin Luther King, and it was like saying, Professor Giraffe. It was so improbable that those two words should go together. I'm bored with having to defend this state because it seems to me that most people I know don't espouse these values. And yet, when I'm at a shopping mall and I see 100 people and I know that 65 of those 100 people have voted consistently for Senator Helms, I feel I'm living in the world of the pod people. I feel that I'm in the realm of science fiction where though the person beside me looks like another human being, but under their shirt collar is a gill. I don't understand how they can perceive what I perceive and feel what I feel, and consistently choose semi-automatic weapons and tobacco. This weird affection for death, this weird death wish which seems to be so central to our culture. To deny funding for AIDS research while you endlessly pump trillions of dollars into tobacco profits. You supplement a weed that you know is killing millions and millions of men, women and children. At the same time, you deny them access to cure. I mean, I don't know whose code this is, but in the most basic Christian code, it seems to me that this is immoral and obscene. And it grieves me to see a person who has deluded himself, and I think that Senator Helms, to do him honor. And that's why I'm getting a hernia here trying to do him honor. Believes honestly that he's doing the right thing and has done the right thing all along. Has missed something. Jesse Helms is known as Senator No, N-O, and it seems to me on the basis of what little I know after 48 years in this world and on this planet, that the thing you want to be known for is saying yes to as many things and as many people as possible. And maybe that no is based on a no that was said to him early on. Maybe it was based on this assurance that the world is full of tricksters and con men and Yankees and people who are trying to do you out of your property and your birthright. And the only response is to take a stick to them and to resist them and to answer in the negative. (gentle instrumental music) - [Tim] Dear Jesse, While I was in Monroe, I came across a copy of a high school newspaper from 1938, the senior edition, in which some of the graduates were assigned various identities. I noticed that your name was next to the word obnoxious. Someone had even circled it. At first, I thought it was funny, but then I realized I was no longer laughing at a US Senator. I was laughing at a teenage boy, a gangly, awkward, bespectacled young man who probably read this in 1938 and was hurt by it. Names and labels can do that sometimes. - I've never heard once in this chamber anybody say to the homosexuals, "Stop what you're doing." Do you realize that if they would stop what they're doing, there would not be one additional case of AIDS in the United States of America. - You know, AIDS is the only disease that it's a disgrace to die. I mean, if you have AIDS -- and it's not. It's a tragedy. It's not a disgrace. (gentle instrumental music) - [Tim] When I came out to my parents, they told me that their greatest fear was that I would contract the virus that causes AIDS. I can only imagine how it must feel to lose a child. Patsy Clark and Eloise Vaughn live in Raleigh. They know exactly how it feels. - My son died in March of 1994, and met a friend in the mall who said she was sorry. And how was I doing? I said, "Okay." She says, "I know someone you need to meet." And she said, "I'm going to tell her to call you." And I said, "Okay, fine." I didn't really believe it would ever happen. Went home. Half and hour after I got back, the phone rang and this voice said, "Is this Patsy Clark?" And I said, "Yeah." She said, "You don't know me." And I thought, "No, I don't, "and I don't want any aluminum siding," because I couldn't imagine anyone really calling. But, it was Eloise, and my life turned around because she lost a son too. And we met very shortly after that. You tell now. (laughing) - Well, so when I called Patsy, we decided that we should meet and have lunch. And we met and had lunch the very next day. And then, we're talking about our situation because we did share so much in common. We decided to meet with some other mothers who had also lost children. And we did not know where those meetings, what direction we would take after that. - No, we didn't. - We got together, and it seemed that everybody had one common thought in mind and that was to try to defeat Jesse Helms 'cause we knew he was coming back up for election this fall. And this started before Christmas. And we all have very strong reasons for wanting to defeat him. And so, we sort of became, we had the name suggested by one of Patsy's children, MAJIC, and it stuck and everybody loves that name. It gets a lot of attention. And as you know, it stands for Mothers Against Jesse in Congress. - [Patsy] And we think it's going to take magic to get rid of him. - It will take magic. And so, we're trying to create some magic, help to create some magic of our own. Patsy and I had been to some meeting of some kind. We came back. We're sitting on my porch and just talking over things. And of course, we're always interested in politics and what goes on. So, I gave her what turned out to be what she calls a litmus test. (laughing) 'Cause I said, "Well, Patsy, what do you think "about abortion? "And what do you think about?" We talked about the gay rights and Jesse Helms 'cause that's what started us off. "And what do you think about education and the arts, "and the death penalty?" - And prayer in the school. - And prayer in the schools. We went through the whole litany. And she was right down the line. She was an absolute Democrat. And I said, "Patsy, you don't know it, "but you're a Democrat." And she really didn't say very much to me at all. (laughing) And I really-- - I'm really a Republican. - And she totally failed. She had totally passed the Democratic test. She had failed totally. And so, pretty soon, she had to get up to go home and she went out and got in her car and left. And I thought, "Oh, my goodness, I have lost my friend. "I'm sure I have just alienated her," because I knew how strong a Republican she said she was, or thought she was. And she got in her car and came home, and I almost called her, but I didn't. But, it turned out, I had not alienated her. She just sort of began to think about those things, and she realized, well, she did pass that test. And so, I think she did some more thinking, and she arrived where she is now. (laughing) We decided we did need a good project, and since we are mothers and we are fighting Jesse Helms, what better way to express ourselves than to send Jesse a special Mother's Day card? And so, we've arranged for a rally to be held on the Capitol grounds, the south side of the Capitol on Saturday afternoon before Mother's Day. And we're going to have a giant Mother's Day card there all decorated just like the Hallmark cards. And it's going to have a special message. - On the night my brother, Mark, died, May 15th, 1990, or actually the day, I was driving home to Raleigh to be with my mother. And we had on the radio, National Public Radio, which was broadcasting Jesse Helms from the United States Senate floor live. He took that opportunity to speak against people with AIDS, basically. It was a bill on funding, AIDS funding, Ryan White Funding for cities who are hardest hit with the disease. And I thought to myself at the time, "I wonder if he could take my mother's hands in his "and look her in the eyes and say the things "that he was saying." And now, I have learned that, yes, he can. - I wrote Senator Helms a letter. He was a business associate of my husband. My husband has tremendous respect for him. He was always very kind to us. In fact, when my husband died in a plane crash, Senator Helms called me and told me he was sorry. He couldn't have been nicer. When I read in the News and Observer that he thought that people who died of AIDS deserved what they got, I couldn't believe that that was the same Senator Helms I had known and voted for. In my naiveté, I thought, "I will explain it to him." And I asked him just not to judge people as deserving what they get if they died of AIDS. No one deserves that, no one. And he wrote me back. He really didn't address what I asked him, I don't think. He told me he didn't judge homosexuality. The Bible did. That made me cry. And then, he went on to say he was very sorry that my son had chosen to play Russian roulette with his sexuality, and that made me cry. Well, I cried for a couple of days. And Eloise and I got to talking and we thought, "Got to do something about this." And that's really, isn't it? - That's really. - When we thought mothers need to do something. - I think he's using the Bible to further his own agenda because my Bible doesn't tell me that. Love and non-judgementalism. That is the whole message. And if you don't get that from the Bible, then we're not reading the same book. - I guess one of our desires, Eloise, stop me if I'm wrong. Is to make it so people are not ashamed of their families, not ashamed to love their sons and to claim them. Not to have to hide. He's propagating, I think, a mean spirit in this state. Why can't we live and let live? What right do I have, or anyone have to judge another human being? That was the great thing about my son. Someone asked me this yesterday. "If you had to describe him, what would you say?" And I said, "Well, he lit up a room, "and he never judged another human being." And he died of AIDS at 31, and I was proud of him. (gentle instrumental music) - [Tim] After the rally, I wandered around the State Capitol Building. There's a statue honoring mothers who lost sons in the Civil War, and another one honoring soldiers from the war in Vietnam. Nearby, I was reminded of a 4th-grade history lesson. The North Carolina state motto is "esse quam videri" which means "to be rather than to seem." I thought about my high school days when to some people, I seemed to have it all. On the surface, my life seemed perfect, but often I lay awake at in bed at night contemplating suicide. Knowing I was gay, but not knowing how to deal with it. Knowing I should probably tell someone, but not knowing who I could tell. Knowing then the difference between the way things seem and the way things actually are. I drove back to Wingate to spend some time with my parents, but they were out of town. Before I'd even taken the key out of the door, the phone rang. I was my friend Dave from New York calling with bad news. Joe had committed suicide. Alone in my parents' house, all I wanted was to be with people who knew Joe and who knew how I felt about him. Two days later, I drove to New York for the memorial service. When I was growing up, my dad had this saying whenever we got hurt or felt bad. He'd say, "It'll feel better when it stops hurting." But, at the time, it wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear. Over the years, I've learned what Dad meant. Experiencing pain brings us that much closer to healing. If I'd been able to express from the beginning how much I loved Joe, Dad might have understood the depth of this loss. And now, when I needed him the most, he would have been able to say, "It'll feel better when it stops hurting." I wish Joe had known my dad. After the memorial service, I drove back to North Carolina. There was still one more person I wanted to see. - Well, the whole Southern experience is an interesting thing. One writer characterized the South as being haunted by God. And Faulkner said, "If you grew up in the South, "it's not an option to be religious "or not be religious." He said, "It's in the air." I guess when I think of Jesse, I remember what a seminary professor at Duke used to say. That is, "It's one thing to be ignorant. "It's another to be aggressively ignorant." And for a lot of us, Jesse is aggressively ignorant. The ultimate thing you do with a person like Jesse Helms is just leave him the hell alone. And if Jesus were sittin' here, I think he'd probably say, "Just pray for him. "He's a deeply troubled man." - [Tim] Mitch Simpson is a Baptist minister in Chapel Hill. For five years, he was the pastor of the church I attended in Wingate. In a world of few heroes, especially of the spiritual variety, Mitch is one of mine. When I came out to my mom and dad, he was there for me and for them. - It seems to be, seemed to me and to Betty in our Wingate years that there was this spirit that wanted so much to be able to light and announce itself that I'm not sure you had anything to announce at that time 'cause I think you were still very much a crucible which you were passing. And in all candor, the other thing I remember is not just our conversation with you, but I remember your folks' response. And I remember that that was not something about which they were glib or flippant or angry. They were genuinely, genuinely baffled and troubled. And from my perspective as their friend and their former pastor, that was as painful as hearing your side of the emergent struggle. Ask your parents today what their response is to some topical questions about identity. I am sure their response would be conditioned by their love of you and their experience of you. The story of the Prodigal Son, it's a misnomer. It's not the Prodigal Son. It's the story about a loving father. End of that story, the son comes back. What does it say? The father saw him from a long way off. Well, what does that tell you? That means that every day since that guy left, and flaunted everything about his tradition, the father had this ritual of going down to the end of the lane and looking down the road. - Dad? - Yes? - [Tim] What do you think of Jesse Helms? - I don't think of him much. - [Tim] For years, it felt like my dad and I have been trying to understand each other. For both of us, I think that's been the goal. But, on this particular afternoon, driving down a stretch of highway dedicated to honor Jesse Helms, I realize that maybe what's more important than understanding is the attempt. Do you think he's honorable? - Well, I think he's, I can't say that. I can't judge him. I don't know his true intentions and I can't judge him in a sense that I can't go along with his views and his attitudes, but whether his intentions are in the right place or not, I have no idea. This may be, he may very well think he's doing what he thinks is right. - [Tim] I know you're talking about more like a Christian judgment, and it's not. He is getting paid to represent what you believe. He's got a job, Dad. - I see where you're comin' from, but he picks his own agenda. And he jumps on this and probably because he knows. And whether he believes all he says or not, and I think this goes back to where who can he say these things to the loudest and the most often? And if I say it with these particular people, they're the ones I going to get my votes from. I mean, and that's a politician. Now, whether he believes everything he says, I don't know. It's hard to swallow now what he is sayin' because he is overbearing, I think, in his opinions. - [Tim] But, what about the content of the opinions? I mean, he is overbearing. That's a personality. - Yeah. - [Tim] I mean, he's a liar. - Well, possibly. You know, I don't have all the facts. - [Tim] But, Dad, just think about me. What he says about me, how could you say he's not a liar? - Well, if you want to pinpoint that, yeah. - [Tim] Let's pinpoint it. Let's talk about it. - I agree. - [Tim] That's pretty fundamental, don't you think? I mean, about how you treat people. - Sure, and that's true of anybody. - Yeah. - About gays-- - [Tim] But, we're talkin' about Jesse. - Blacks or anybody. Well, I'm talkin' about him too. And I'm wondering if he would say or feel this way if in his own family he had someone gay. - [Tim] There's no easy answers anyway. People think I work for the FBI, Dad. (laughing) - We're working surveillance. (laughing) Special Agent JK. - This is the pond where the children-- - [Tim] Do you remember when it froze over and all these kids were on it, and all the parents were screamin'? "Get off the pond!" David Williams. There's the Mason's. Their brick looks like our brick. - [Dad] Oh, yeah, it's the same kind. - [Tim] There's the house. Yard looks good. - [Dad] Grass is green. There's our camper. - [Tim] Got anything else you want to say? - Oh, no, not much. I never have been much to talk on camera. - [Tim] It's been good seein' you. - Good seein' you always. (gentle guitar music) - [Tim] Dear Jesse, By the time summer arrived, I was running out of film and money, and I felt it was time to get back to my life in New York. This time was different. I knew I wasn't running away. And now when I tell someone I'm from North Carolina, I still may think of you, but I'll also think about this time and remember the people who've made me want to come home again. And I'll remember the state motto which says that what's most important is not the way things seem, but the way things are. Senator, to some, you seem evil, dangerous, immoral. To some, I seem evil, dangerous, immoral. Are you? Am I? This is April 9th, 1996 in Salisbury, North Carolina, my very first day of shooting Dear Jesse. Earlier that day, I had received a call telling me that Jesse Helms would be attending a rally for presidential candidate Bob Dole at Catawba College. We arrived on campus too late to get into the rally, but I did manage to stop a few people as they were leaving. So, what about Helms? What about Helms? What do you think? - I'm a theater major here, and because of his views on like the arts and stuff. Not just that, but I mean, he's like obviously racist and homophobic and stuff like that and black. And this is my boyfriend, so. I don't fit in either of those categories. (laughing) - [Tim] Do you think he represents what North Carolinians feel? - No, I think more on the conservative side of North Carolina. - Well, North Carolina, I think, in general. I've lived here, neither of us have lived here that long. But, what I've seen of North Carolina so far is that it's pretty much like that. - It's like-- - In general, I mean, I think of our town for instance. - Yeah. - I mean, of course there's some radical spots. You're always going to have radical spots, places, but in general, I think, at least here. I don't know, I haven't really traveled that much. I can't really say North Carolina in general because I haven't been around. But, here, it's pretty much. Yeah, we had like a KKK march here beginning of the year? - Yeah, in October, I think. - Or something like that. - [Tim] Are you guys involved in the gay group here? - He is, I'm not. - What's it like? - It's really small. - Small, but we're met with a lot of resistance. - Resistance, yeah. I guess because it's a conservative Christian school and a lot of kids that come here-- - [Tim] This is a religious school? - It's religious affiliated with-- - UCC. - [Tim] 2 1/2 years later, on October 7th, 1998, Matthew Shepherd was murdered by two young men because he was gay. He was tied to a fence, pistol whipped and left to die on a cold Wyoming night. He was 21 years old. This is the only footage I have of Matthew. It isn't fair.
