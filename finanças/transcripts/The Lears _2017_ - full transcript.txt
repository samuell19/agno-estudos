Recently, uh... I don't know, I've been taking some time to, uh, meditate on death and the remains of mortal objects. Skulls, bones, I managed to spend a day in a morgue. And I'm not gonna tell you how I convinced them to let me linger there, but they did. And that's another story. But, uh, I believe with a creative life that, uh, contemplation of mortality is essential meditation. Consider the way the feces from all the animals and rotting carcasses of all dead creatures feeds the planet, and bring about new life. So death is in a fundamental way... creative. And to die is to feed the environment with a life giving force. Let's meditate on the idea of a building. Is it bricks and mortar? Is it steel and glass? Imagine a day when the walls and the structures that we live in grow and change organically around us, according to carefully calculated algorithms. Now, you could stop at the basement renovation, you'd still have the income suite. But I think the coach house would have an enormous long term value to the property. I don't know, but it is a little pricy. Well, perhaps we can reduce the surface area for you guys in here. Oh! Doesn't seem very solid either. Well, uh, that... that was a model. Uh, the... the actual final result would be more durable. Yeah, you know what, Jonathan, we actually have to go. I'm sorry, the sitter's gonna be at the house -in 15 minutes. -Ah, that's right. We have to go, Glenn. You've given us a lot to think about. -Great. -Um, we'll touch base next week -and see where we're at. -Okay. Yeah, of course. But, meaning to ask you. Lear... Any relationship with the architect -Davenport Lear? -Uh, no. No. No relation. -Oh, well. Hey. -Talk to you soon. -Yeah. -Okay. Thanks, John. The future, my friends, China. A land with the demands of population and a government that benefits from capitalistic greed. But without the requisite permission required by private enterprise to make radical, bold and sometimes unpopular decisions. I... I know you don't have the same restrictions in China, but I assure you, you do not want uh, Davenport to leverage his draconian opinions on your, uh... on your project. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're sort of, uh, an autonomous franchise. No, no, no, no. Wait. Yeah, yeah. You'll have the exact same design team you would as if you're working under Davenport. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit of magic. No, sir. Yeah, I understand. Okay. Well... Not bad. Little early for that kind of volume isn't? Oh, the twins are up. Yeah. I got it. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Hello, who's this? Is this Glenn Lear I have the pleasure of speaking with? Yeah, this is Glenn Lear. Who's this? My name is Tyler, I work for your father, Davenport Lear. He asked me to make contact with you. What for? I... I haven't... I haven't spoken to him in years. Your father specifically requested I contact all of his children. He wants you in LA this weekend. Tyler, it'd be nice get a little bit more, uh, warning when I'm being summoned by the great man, you know. I'm sorry. I called as soon as he asked me too. Let's not leave out the enormous egos involved in this great creative act. Would it not inflate any man's head to know that he is shaping the very landscape on which humanity treads? Not even the best among us is entirely immune to this hubris. Tyler, the day that I need someone to pay for my flights is the day I put a gun to my head. So, no. You tell dad to keep his money, I don't need it. And I will see you tomorrow. Okay, bye. Ridiculous. Okay, so we need your signature. - Yeah. - There, there. Okay, and I need my, uh... -My ticket's on my phone please. -Here is your paper ticket. Okay. But on my phone. You just put your thumb here. -It'll show up when you... -Okay, great. -Is the car ready? -Car's ready. -Okay, let's go. -And your bag's in your car. -Okay, please stop talking. -And you're car's warm -Let's get the car and let's go. -There's just one more thing we need. Phil's waiting outside. He's been waiting for two hours, -Just give him five minutes. -Okay, send him in. -Just five minutes. -Send him in. Send him in. Wonderful, so, uh, Mr. Lear just has a few minutes - before he catches him flight. - Hello, Phil. -Hey, Kent. How are you? -I'm good. You're fired. - What? - You're fired. What do you mean I'm fired? This deal that just blew up in your face cost me a lot of money. Okay? I don't like losing money so you're fired. You've never had a bad deal? No, Phil. I've never had a bad deal. If I could just say, he has a wife -and three kids... -Amelia, get a security... -His wife just... -Stop talking. Take his security pass. Get his ass -out of the building. Right now. -I'm on to it, sir. I'm so sorry, Phil. Um... Please, stop... stop talking. - One-thirty. - Stop talking. Sorry... I think he is retiring. I think he's gathering us all together so he could tell us how he's gonna divide up the company. You know, Rory's coming. -Rory's coming? -Yup. I mean, that's what they told me. Huh. Uh, where is he? You're one tough son of a bitch to find, you know that? This is your weekend. I have plans. Okay, uh, I know. I'm sorry. It's important to me. It's about my dad. - Davenport? - Yes. He wants me to come to LA. Okay? And I think he's gonna announce his retirement, and he's flying me down there first class, Sal. And I think... I think this is finally it. I think he's finally decided that I'm the one. The one? The one to take over the company. What? He practically abandoned you. Hi there, you two. - Hi, Diana. Is, uh, - Hi. -is Rory here? -Uh, no. -But, uh, Kent's inside. -Okay. Hey. -Hey. -Hey, please, let me get those. -You've had a long trip. Please. -Yeah? -You sure? All right. Here. -Oh, yes. Got it, I've got it. -Yeah. -I got it, I got it. -Yeah. Okay. All right. -I've got the... Yeah. Yeah? No, on Tuesday. Uh-huh. All right. All right, I'll see him then. Excuse me, Kent. Regan, Tom, how are you guys? Good to see you as always, Kent. How ya doin'? How are things on your end? Well, constantly busy, you know, making money hand over fist. How's the architecture game? Pretty good, pretty good. Davenport keeps us hopping. I'll bet he does. Regan. How are the twins? Happily with the nanny so we can get some sleep this weekend. Oh, I doubt we'll be doing much of that. Really, Kent? Oh, she's still a bit of a bitch, eh, Tom? Don't mind her. She's just a bit sleep deprived. Oh, thanks. Diana, when Davenport gets here I'd, uh, have Delia go home. It's a work weekend. Kent? Architecture is returning to something more primal. More nomadic. Like the landscape in which we lived. But truthfully, is architecture really a field that aims to service basic pragmatic human needs? Or is it something else? Is it something more kin to a religious calling, where temples are erected to pay tribute to the great rulers of the day? You must be Glenn? I'm Tom, Regan's husband. Heard a lot of good things about you. Tom. Nice to meet you. Is, uh, dad here yet or... No, no. No, please. Thanks. Can I get you something to drink, uh, glass -of water or something? -No, I'm good. Good, thanks. Wow. It's nice to see Davenport can afford such a, uh, beautiful retreat. Well, by Lear standards it's actually quite modest. Right. Modest. Is this Davenport's idea of modest? Why do you think he would bring us all here? Well, he wants to divide up the kingdom, of course. Shoulda known Kent would get the jump on all of us. Fuck you, Glenn. Oh! Welcome to LA. How about we don't start the weekend like this? No, it's okay, Tom. Kent's always been a bit of a bastard. I'm not just speaking metaphorically here, all right, Kent? Glenn, I don't know if you know Diana, she's Davenports personal assistant. Oh, of course, I know Diana. How are you, dear? Grand. Grand, thank you. Uh, busy. You know your father. Keep me running around. He hasn't slowed down even in his age, huh? No. But I hear you have, um, a firm in Toronto now, and a design at the Biennale last year? - I did. Yeah. - Wow. That's great. Thanks. Yeah, it's prestigious, you know. Doesn't get me too many clients but I do all right. What kind of projects you working on? uh, mostly residential stuff. Oh. Translation, kitchen and bathroom renos. So, condos. That's fantastic. I... I hear the, uh, market is booming up there. Oh, not for old Glenn here. There is no way that he would be standing in a house of Davenport's if it wasn't the promise of a big chunk of cash. Am I right, big brother? - Fuck you, Kent. - Oh, no. Fuck you, Glenn. Ah! Diana, I have to pop out for a bit so I will see you at dinner. But please, set an extra place, because I am bringing a friend. No, Kent. It's a family dinner this evening. He's still the same arrogant prick. Ah, never mind him. Oh, fuck! Jonathan, Glenn Lear. Yeah, listen. I thought I'd call you. I... You know, I realized the, uh, the plywood geometric thing might have been a stretch, and I could, uh... Yeah. I could tell... I got the feeling your wife didn't really like it. Could you just give it till Monday? That's... Yeah, 'cause we put a lot of work into it. I really appreciate it, John. Okay. Thanks. Fuck. Give me a hug! -All right. -Come on! Mm! - Oh! How are you? - I'm good. -Oh, I've missed this face. -You look good. -I do? -Oh, yeah. Yeah? Okay, here. I'll... I'll take that. -You'll take that? -Yeah, everybody's - already inside. - Okay. Just relax, huh. I know. Hi, Tom. Hey. Hey, Glenn. How's it going, big brother? Hey, man. - Diana. - Hey, Rory. Any trouble finding the place? No, no. I've been here loads of times. Really? I thought Davenport liked to keep this place empty. Uh, no. He, uh, he lets me stay here when I'm in town. It's my little LA pad by the ocean. Great. Oh! Uh, Rory's gonna tell us all about his motorcycle ventures through South America, -so... -Uh, can we wait until he's settled 'cause, uh, dinner's in half an hour. Okay? Uh, why don't you stay downstairs with us? - Oh. - Come on, we can like talk late at night. Be kids like old times. Fuck. â™ª Every season â™ª Change of heart â™ª This deciduous life of mine â™ª I ain't no Kingly castle love â™ª â™ª Though I often long to be â™ª For I could hold you Close enough â™ª â™ª And keep you safe with me May I please speak with Mr. Chairman? Yes, it's Tom Cornwall from Lear and Partners. Yes, of course. I'll hold. Ah! You know when you'll be expecting him back? I see. Very well. I'll try back again tomorrow, thanks very much. Fuck! Sorry. What about dad, when's he arriving? Uh, yeah. He's not expected til tomorrow. Tomorrow? That's not what he told us. I thought he'd be here today. Well, he's a very busy man. Oh. I guess the rest of us have nothing but time on our hands. That's not what I meant, Glenn. Well, I mean he made a point of flying us all in so I was just wondering Well, maybe he just wanted you all to reconnect before he got here, you know. Hm. Um, actually, you know, you could do something for me. Um, my daughter, Delia, she's gonna stay for dinner so, um, could you hop out and ask her to get changed? - Oh, she's out back? - Yeah. Okay. Hi, handsome. What's your name? I'm Glenn. I thought you would have been a Daniel or a Race or something sexy. Glenn isn't sexy. No? I spell it with two N's. Come on. It's still not sexy. Well, I'm probably your dad's age. It's a good thing. I don't have a father. Everyone has a father. Well, even if they're an asshole. Is your father an asshole? I think so. That's too bad. I think your mom wants you to come inside and get changed for dinner. You don't like my outfit? No, I like it. I like it. I just don't know if it's proper dinner attire. What are you doing here anyway? This is my father's house. You're a Lear? Yeah. Which one are you? I don't know much about you. Yeah. I'm the, uh, prodigal son. I live in Toronto. That sucks. I hear Toronto's lame. No, it doesn't suck. It's not California. No, it's not California. -Huh? This is the house. -Oh. -Oh, hey! We're here. -Hi. I hope you didn't start dinner without us. No, no, no. Of course not. So, this is Natalie. We've known each other for ages, she's practically family. Say, hello, Natalie. -Hello. -Do you hear that accent? How sexy is that, huh? -Very, very. -Don't be an asshole. Oh, I love it when you say that. Let's get some drinks. Hm. Here you go. A toast. To celebrate the homecoming of the sons and daughters of Davenport Lear. Where is the king by the way? Oh, he's, uh, been delayed. You know your father. So, Glenn with two N's, tell me about yourself. How is it you ended up in Toronto, the obscure, strange older brother? Uh, personally I'd love to hear about South America. Yeah. Are you avoiding -the hard questions, Glenn? -No, no. Come on, now. That's no fun. Delia, mind yourself there, please. Yes, Mother. No, no. It's fine, Delia. Actually, I live in Toronto because that's where Davenport first met my mother. Uh, she's the first wife who's name no one can seem to remember but it's actually Helen. -Where's Helen now? -She lives in Toronto. And, uh, I go and see her from time to time and she suffers from dementia, she's about 80. Yeah. That's depressing. But if Davenport Lear was gonna make things work he was gonna have to do two things. He was gonna have to change locations and he was gonna have to upgrade his wife. So, he dumped the old model, my mom and he took up with Kent's mom. A very charming woman and thinks to seem to go swimmingly for a while. But then, you know, he got a little bored, he started shopping the aisles until he picked up with Rosalyn, who is the, uh, beautiful, very affluent and, uh, lovely mother to Rory and Regan. And, uh... Sadly she got sick. And she had cancer and she passed on. Um... So, I... I don't know. I just somehow feel like this is a setup for the next cancer announcements. Davenport was never happy with Helen. He spent most weekends at our place even while he was still married to her. You know, but she... She badgered him and she pushed him out. If she hadn't been such a bitch to him, he may never have left Toronto. But she made sure he got as far away as possible and so after he left there was no reason for us to stay. In a way, you know, I think he did us a favor. And I have his breakup with your mom to thank for me getting my start in New York. So I say, "Thank God for that." Hmm? I'm really glad my poor old mother could help service your fucking life in some way. Hey, get off your righteous martyr horse, Glenn. You're way too old for this - self-pity bullshit. - Okay, it's no one's fault that he left your mother. Some mirages just can't work. Okay? There's no passion, it's as simple as that. Sometimes things just don't work out. We're all here in the spirit of openness, right? All of us here are grown-ups, some more than others. I think it's time that you guys know what it was like being the eldest - in this fucked up family. - Uh, okay. Yes, we're all officially dying to hear about it, Glenn. At first it was just Davenport, me and Helen. Davenport always worked a lot, but he was home, you know. And he would help me with my homework and shit, but I used to study piano as a kid and I fucking hated the piano, but I was too scared to give it up, you know. Because it was the only time that I had him all to myself. You know? And he was mine. You know, I just... I don't know what I did to Davenport, you know, to make him stop wanting me when I was a kid. Glenn, he never stopped loving you. Diana, what would you know about that? You know, I never had much time with... Davenport as a child either. But when he disappeared from my life, you know what I did? I sought him out and I confronted him like a man. And we have a pretty good relationship today. Lucky you. You never call him, you never visit. I actually come to LA quite a lot. And I never make a trip here without announcing it to him. Well, he just... He's just always busy. You know, he's just never really seemed to have the time. Well, we're all gathered. The great man has called us. We don't know why. We don't know where he is. Now that's classic Davenport. Huh? I'd love to hear about South America, Rory. - Yeah, Ror. - Yeah. Regale us with the tails of your youthful-carefree travels. Carry away. Well, there's not much to say really. I mean, I spent the last year in my motorcycle traveling through South America. Cool. What for? I don't know. I just felt the need to get away from everything. Didn't you ever feel like that? Sure. Sure, I know. Of course I did. I just... I got a job and I got a kid I gotta support, you know. On that treadmill, you know what I mean? I can't bear any more of this self-pity. I need a smoke. Come on, Natalie, let's go. You can be such an asshole, Kent. Say that word again. I love it when you say it like that. We're finally gathered here, we're doing a little family sharing and you brought exotic dancer here, now you both need to fucking smoke. Great! I'm an actress. I'm sure you are, gorgeous. You know what, I should punch you in the face. Well, fucking bring it. Yeah, I'm gonna bring it, buddy. Gentlemen! Glenn, I don't know you very well and you've obviously got some issues. But that is way too much hostility. Guess what, Tom, I don't know you very well either. Maybe mind your fucking business, okay? This family is my business. Oh, is it really your business? Is that why you married my sister, Regan? Who's by the way, way too fucking hot and young for you, okay? For a little piece? A little piece of the family business there? Of course that's why he married her. Kent, you're gonna turn on me now too? - What's the matter with you? - Come on, Tom. There's nothing to be ashamed of. It was a political marriage, so what? We have a beautiful and healthy marriage. Come on, let's get some wine. You think Davenport Lear's gonna come in here and tell us that he's dying of cancer, and that he's finally decided to choose a successor? And it's gonna be none other than that's right, half-weighted, middle-aged mediocrity Tom Cornwall here. You're the man for the job, Tommy. - He's not dying. - Oh, he's... What? Then why would he bring us all together? I think Glenn's right. I think he's dying. I mean, maybe not right now, but I... I think this is... this is weird. Gathering us like this. I mean, I haven't seen Glenn - since our mother's funeral. - Exactly. Because we know the truth. the truth is that Davenport doesn't call his favorite son because he has some desire to have a family get together. Right? I mean, usually, Delia, I'm the one who's invited to the sober events. Shut the fuck up! Which reminds me, Diana, do you think you could get us some more of this, uh... Would you get it yourself? My mom's not the help. Oh, sweetheart, I... I have to tell you she actually is. No, she isn't. Would you tell them? Tell them what? Tell them why they're really here. Diana, why are we really here? Davenport invited you all here this weekend for a very specific reason. This Sunday he's marrying my mom. That's what's happening. Delia, you shouldn't have said that. Why not? 'Cause I can't stand watching them treat you like dad's maid. Dad? He's gonna be my father too. So just get used to it. That's fucking perfectly ridiculous. I agree with Glenn. I mean, enough is enough, the guy's like 80 years old. It's not ridiculous, it's just a fact. And he's only 75. -Oh, wow. -Delia, be a pet and go get a sweater for me from my room please. Davenport is Delia's father. Well, he will be after the wedding, -I guess. -No. I mean he is her actual father. It happened 18 years ago. I'm not enormously proud of it, -but it happened. -What? Delia doesn't know. Okay? And Davenport is trying to deal with the right things. So I would appreciate it if you would all keep that quiet. Davenport and I want to be able to tell her ourselves. Jesus Christ. Oh, it's just... It's time to just get it all out in the open, you know? Enough secrets in this family. Wait, you had a child with dad? Diana... Really? I didn't want you to find out like this, I'm sorry. And Davenport had wanted to tell you after he arrived, but... This Sunday... at this house... there will be a wedding and that is why you're all here. Go to bed, young lady. Go, hmm. -Hey. -Hey. It's okay. They'll come around, Mom. I don't even know why you guys bothered to invite them all anyway. They all just think it's a big payout. Oh, my love. You don't understand a thing. Love you. Rory, what are you doing? -What are you doing? -I'm... I'm... -I'm leaving. -No, you're not. No, no, no. You can't... you can't leave me, Rory. Do not do this to me. What's the point of all this? Who cares if dad's marrying Diana? It doesn't matter. I don't care but I mean he's not even here. I'm sick of being manipulated all the time. Last time when you left me I... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it. I... I don't... I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with me. Having you here is like the sun is shining again. Stop it. I'm not happy when you're not around. It's not healthy for us to be around each other. Why do think I'm in a hiding? You know, why did you come here? Because Tommy said this was important. I thought Davenport was dying. - Huh? - What about me? What about you? Don't I mean anything to you? Of course. We were young. That was a long time ago. I mean, I don't really think about it that much to be honest with you. I do. Every single day. Well, as it turns out I'm gonna need a little bit more time. Yeah, I know we said the weekend but it's the family, you don't wanna push. No, he's not here yet. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I understand. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Whoa, you're not thinking of leaving are you? Well, you can't... you can't leave. -Really? -Yeah. You know, see what he's got going on. Yeah, I see what he's got going on. Clearly, he knocked this woman up 18 years ago and the company's gonna be hers. Not the first guy to have his judgement skewered by a nice pair of tits but probably not the last. Oh, he definitely won't be the last. Where the fuck did you come from? I think if you leave now, you're gonna blow your chances with Davenport. What chances are you talking about? The guy doesn't give a shit. He doesn't care about his kids, he never has. I mean, it's like I'm denying to any connections to this guy, it's fucking embarrassing. And then he thinks I'm gonna give a shit - about his third marriage? - It's a test. Don't you guys see that? What? Well, maybe you don't see it. Maybe I'm the only one the does 'cause I don't give a shit about his money or his precious firm, but don't you think it's some kinda test? Go on, genius. What do you got? I think that he's brought us here thinking it's about a wedding, but I think it's about more than just a wedding. No. I don't think so. You're already here, Glenn. Could either of you afford to leave? I mean, can either of you afford to leave and not see for yourselves? Look. Rory's his favorite son. I'm the outsider. Don't confuse it. -You know what, Glenn? -What? That means we have something in common. -Do we? -Yeah, we're both outsiders. -Are we? -Yeah. We both wanna get what we deserve. All right? We may not be brothers but I've spent my entire life helping you build your father's firm. So I know what you're saying. What do we have to show for it? We? Tom, I run a minuscule firm in Toronto. Okay? I got a couple of interns mostly on the volunteer basis. I have problems selling renovations to yuppies. That's my fucking world. I don't we have much in common. You're a nice guy though. Glenn. -What? -You're a very good designer. -How the fuck do you know? -Because I know. Davenport follows your work. You may not think he does but he does. And I have seen your stuff too. The Biennale entry was sublime. Sublime? Sublime. I think you oughta stick around until Davenport gets here. What do you have to lose? He's right. My pride. Oh, of course. Your pride. Fuck you. Look, I'm gonna stick it out. I think you'll regret it if you don't. What's the worst scenario? You have to sit though a tacky wedding and eat some questionable catering. And spend time with family. Now I'm gonna buy you a drink. So early? -Yeah. -Nice. Hello? Hey. Uh, I just wanted to see if you needed help with anything. Uh, no. No, thanks. Is that your dress? Yeah. Can I see it? Yeah, sure. Help yourself. Actually, no. Um, on you. Um... Yeah. You have a great body. Wow. Thank you. All this time that we worked together, I guess it was one of those little things I never noticed. I mean, my dad must've, but... I don't know how, uh, anyone gets close to him. He's always been so detached. He loves you. Um, I don't know. You could use something. Well, I didn't want to think formal, I mean, it's just a garden wedding. Yeah, I know. But we should add a little something to it. Oh, I have this woman that I go to sometimes, we could drop by. She could fix it up. I've gotta organize the catering and the flowers and... You can delegate. It's not a secret anymore and God knows Tom wants to be kept busy. Just never imagined myself picking up catering for Davenport's wedding. - Yeah. - Thanks for coming along. Yeah. Well, Kent wasn't gonna get off his ass. You know him. Hmm? Hey, Tyler. Nope. Everybody's out picking up things for the wedding. Yeah, everybody's fine. I mean, Glenn was gonna leave but, uh, Tom and I convinced him to stay. When are you guys showing up? Can I ask you something? Sure. Why did you marry Tom? Oh, he, um... He was a loyal foot solider. My dad always liked him. He was... the kinda guy you could count on to get the work done and never the kinda guy that was gonna be a threat, so. And do you love him? Sure. Yeah, in a way. I guess our marriage is, um... more of a business arrangement, if that makes any sense. It does. Architects are the artist is who will shape the textures and the landscapes of the future. So it is our moral duty to protect the world from this appalling, environmental degradation. This planet is our home. We are its stewards, its caretakers... and nothing more. I've been kissing Davenport's ass for 20 years, I'd like a little piece. I think I've earned it. I gotta see how the weekend pans out but I got a pretty big project going. Think I could use a partner. So, Tom, why not Davenport? Davenport would never go for it. And without him, without the Lear name it's a dead in the water. So I'm curious, Tom, why won't Davenport go for it? Well, he's got pretty strict codes about architectural projects that don't meet his environmental ideal. Okay, so where is this project? China. - These fit. - Wow. Casual for a wedding dress. Oh, well, we're just trying to keep it simple. Yeah, but still, there's nothing simple about a wedding, is there? Well, it's just immediate family, so, yeah. Yeah. I don't know, I think such a special occasion requires a very special dress. Sure! Sure, sure. But, I, uh, I... I like this dress. I like it too. I just think we need to zhoosh it up a bit and, um, give it some more distinction. - Exactly. Yeah, I agree. - Yeah. Yeah, um... Where's my... I'm gonna show you some flowers and you're gonna tell me what you like. Who cares what I like, you just pick 'em. I care. Pink or yellow? Or pink and yellow? Too... too traditional. What do you think? I like it. I mean, it's simple but with a certain something. Not too sexy. -No. -Wouldn't want Davenport having a heart attack. Davenport's in very good shape for a man of his age. Well, he should be. I mean, you look good enough to eat. What do you think? Oh. Oh, are you... are you okay? - You're all right. - Okay, hold on. Hold on. You're good, you're good. Is it the dress? No, it's not the dress. I'll get you a drink. Jesus. - Are you okay? - I just never... I never thought I'd end up like this. Like this. Well then, what, like what? I mean, you... you look beautiful, you're marrying a really rich and successful older man. -I mean, it could be worse. -I know. I know I should be... I should be really grateful. I know that, I just... I just imagined it would be different. That's all. The Chinese are crazy. All right, they have more money then they know what to do with. But they are obsessed with having a Lear project. Yeah, but even with me helping you, it still wouldn't be a Lear project. Uh, well, first of all you are a Lear. But I can also sell them on the legacy idea. But why can't you just make the deal with the Chinese and use Regan as your partner? Regan doesn't wanna do anything that even smacks of... Behind Davenport's back. Look, I don't know how I feel about that myself. You can do what you want, you're not a part of this company. You never have been. You're free to make your own decisions. And by the way, you are a Lear. From what I understand from Davenport, you could use the money. He told you that? Well, he implied it once. What did he say? It doesn't matter. Tell me. - Tell me. - He said that you are stubborn and that your firm will always be... a two-bit operation. - Two-bit operation. - That's what he said. What a fucking prick. Well, he still admired your Biennale project. - We all did. I told you. - Yeah, sure. Sure he did. He saw it. We all saw it. Man, it was... Yeah, sublime. Yeah, I know, I get it. All right, I'll do it. - Really? - Yeah. -You sure? -Sure. I'll partner with you on the China project. That's fantastic. I don't know anything about it. You will, you're gonna love it. And I'm gonna be more than just a name you can use. Okay? - Yeah, of course. - I wanna see your plans. I wanna have legitimate input on stuff. That is the whole idea. It's gonna be great. Davenport, are you here? Dad? Well, here's the happy crew. He said he'd be here for dinner. So you spoke to him? Well, Tyler actually. Well, as long as you have a drink, you know, table for one. Good for you. I asked him to call. Can I come in? Sure. Okay, that's far enough. Oh, come on. You're no fun. I don't bite. Listen, I, uh... I need you to get dressed, young lady. -Okay? -Young lady? Yeah, you're barely 18. -So? -So your mother will kill me. I won't tell. Look, you don't... Okay, listen... Uh, yeah, hello? It's Diana. Yeah, yeah, come on in. I'm just, uh, I'm just getting dressed. Yeah, come on in. - Is everything all right? - Yeah. Yeah, just, uh, putting my pants on. Of course, you are. Glenn pants on is pants off. - What's what supposed to mean? - You know exactly what that's gonna mean. What's going on? You all right? You look upset. -What's going on here? -No. No, I'm not all right, I'm not all right... I thought I knew what I was doing with Davenport, I really did. It's just, uh... I'm just not thinking clearly, Glenn. Right. No, I understand. I understand how it is. But listen, -could you do me a favor... -No. -Come on, come on. -I'm just, uh... I thought I loved him, Glenn. I really did but now that you're here I just... -I don't know, I'm just not -Okay, okay. -sure. -Can we have this conversation a little bit later in the hallway. Can we? Listen, let's have this conversation... -You're pushing me away again. -No. No, no. I'm not. I just want you to go to the hallway and then talk and we'll take a walk. -Oh, god. -Okay? - Okay. - Okay, great. Okay? Just wait there in the hallway. Okay? Well, that was interesting. Listen, kid. You're killing me, okay? I'm pushing 50 and you're driving me crazy. I need you to get dressed, please. -You're killing me. -My mom has a thing for you. - She had a thing for me --Oh. It was 20 years ago. I was young, -she was young we were... -Oh, I think it's still a thing -It's not, it's not, it's not... -Don't... Don't worry, I'm not jealous. Actually, I think it's kinda sexy. Oh, my god. Listen, you gotta go. Here we go. This way. Okay. Listen, come on, come on. Okay. This way, okay. Down the hall. â™ª Once I had â™ª A pretty little woman â™ª She would lie Hm. â™ª Way her pie â™ª Sugarland Mountain â™ª I tell you... Come on, Delia, I'm not interested. Regan. Sorry, I thought you were Delia. What, she's stalking you now? Yeah, it started this afternoon. You should have seen what happened earlier at Will's place. Oh, my god. Diana tried on her dress and she completely started losing it. Where the fuck is Davenport anyway. -Fucking disaster. -Hell, if I know. Rory, you got me thinking... I have to stop living this lie. What do you mean? My whole life with Tom. My marriage. It's a... It's a fucking joke. Regan, we can't go back there. We were just kids playing around. You know, it's what kids do. Yeah, when I'm with you I'm transported back. -It's fucked up and you know it. -Okay. So it's fucked up but it's how I feel and it's tearing me apart inside. We're twins, okay? And you're closer to me than -anyone in this world. -I know. We share all this DNA and... and of course we have this crazy bond. But... So you love me? -'Course I do. -Okay. Okay, then say it. Say you love me. Rory, say you love me. Fuck. Hello? Tyler, hi, where are you? Okay, well, just get here as soon as you can. Uh, that was Tyler, your father's delayed, um... I don't know, he's in a plane, there's a storm, um, so... Hm. They're gonna wait to be cleared for takeoff, so we might as well continue dinner without him. Again. He's not coming. Funny how he called us all here like it was some bloody life or death situation and he's not even here. He's not even here. Maybe he doesn't exist. Maybe he's the Wizard of Oz. Stop being so fucking melodramatic. He's coming, it's just a weather delay. How come you always seem to know so much about what Davenport is doing? I don't know anything. All I said was that he's coming. I don't think anyone really knows what Davenport's up to. He's an enigma. He's not an enigma. I think he's a manipulative-punitive patriarch who's kept all his kids on a leash. Except for the old one he disowned. But you know what the real problem is with you guys, is that you could never quite get yourselves off dad's leash, could you? I'm not on a leash. It's Tom an Regan's story, it's not mine. Well, some of us are expected to work for a living. Tom, you've never had to build anything from scratch like Glenn. He may not have much to show for it but at least he's been given the privilege of independence. Thanks for the kind words, kid. To be honest, I would've... given my left arm for what you and Regan had with dad. Well, it's hard to be a Lear I guess, uh, if you're not the Lear. I thought of changing my profession, Delia. I thought of fucking retiring completely. Yeah, we all know you're need to, uh... give up when the going gets though, Glenn. I don't give up on things, okay? -I kept at it. Thank you. -Yeah. You, you're afraid to take responsibility - for your own name. - That's not true. Oh, I think it is true. I'm just saying, Glenn had to do it on his own. Regan and I worked for the firm, she still does but I couldn't take it anymore. Oh, so that's why you left, 'cause you couldn't take it anymore, that's why? Yeah. Riding my motorcycle through South America was incredibly therapeutic. And who paid for that? This, uh, voyage of self-discovery. -I did. -Oh, really? Really? You don't work. You never have. Yeah, I actually never have thought to ask, but how... how do you make a living, Rory? Tell them. Tell them what? Oh, here it comes. Davenport has given him money every month for years. I fucking knew it. Of course he does. What's that supposed to mean? It means that the golden boy is living off the golden old man still. All this free spirit bullshit. You're a trust fund kid. I respect that. But not a kid anymore and it is a handout. Sure, Glenn. Whatever you say. Hey, I've never seen any of it, okay? Not a thin red dime. Well, even if he offered anything to me I wouldn't take the dime. Oh, we'll see about that, tough guy. Look, Davenport's human, okay? if it was up to me I would have done things differently. But if you think he's what's been holding you back, what bullshit! Get over it! Get over yourself. TouchÃ©. You know, incredibly, actually I thought this time would be different. I thought that near the end of his life that Davenport would actually try to reconcile himself to his abandoned son if... Glenn. He didn't abandon you, he just hated your mother, okay? He was trying to get away from her clawing neediness, don't you get that? Yeah, she's real fucking needy. That neediness is paid for by the government of Canada, okay? And she's doing really well. She's got three geriatric roommates that she spends most nights with. They all fucking drool and cry and wail through the night. It's fucking sublime, you should come visit. I'm sorry, Glenn. Watching my mother die was no picnic. - Okay? - I could appreciate that but at least you had Davenport -to pull her through. -Yes. She did, didn't she? 'Cause she was the love of his life. -I was in love once. -Oh! -Here we go. Mm-hmm. -I mean, not with your father. I'm... I'm settling for your father but... I couldn't be with the one that I really loved. Oh, god. I loved him. But, um... He acted like I never existed, so... And I wasn't gonna be alone. And I want to make sure that Delia was taken care of, so even if he couldn't... I made bloody sure his family would take care of her. Mom, what are you saying? I'm saying that Glenn is your father. What? - What? - What? That's ridiculous. You just told us last night that Davenport was her father. Davenport's my father? You're just angry at Davenport and that's why you're making a scene correct? Are you denying you slept with me? That was years ago, what about Davenport? I didn't sleep with Davenport until after I was pregnant because guess what? I assumed that you wouldn't manage to be there for me. What a story. Oh, where's all that compassion, Glenn? You know, um, Glenn, used to come down to LA looking for his father and, um, he was always busy or he was traveling, and I just... I couldn't understand it. I just... I couldn't understand how a father could hurt his son like that. We slept together on the fourth of July and, oh, my god there were fireworks. Nine months later Delia arrived. Ah... So the wounded prodigal son has some baggage of his own. Of course he does. Have a look at her. Look at her. Take a really good look at her because she is yours, Glenn. She is yours. I mean, I asked Regan, I mean today in the dressmakers. I just... I couldn't do it. You know, if you're not willing to step up to your responsibilities for your kid that's fine, because you know what? Davenport will. Because the wrong Lear is better than no Lear at all. You're my father? -You tried to kiss me. -I don't know. - I did not try to kiss you. - You tried to kiss her? She's been throwing herself at everybody since we got here, ask Rory and ask Kent. Sorry, you wanted to have sex with your daughter? Listen, she's not my... You're not my daughter. - You're not my daughter. - Oh, no? No? How do you know? How do you know? Do you... Do you deny having sex with me? - Do you? - It was 20 years ago and I was fucking drunk, and I don't remember. Wait, so this... All this, this... The breakdowns, the misgivings, what, you couldn't have just -told us that it was Glenn? -Well, I didn't want -to complicate everything. -Oh! I don't think it could be more complicated. Diana is in love with Glenn. Glenn would rather be having sex with his daughter, who's aunt, my wife Regan is totally infatuated with her brother Rory whose other brother Kent will fuck anything that walks! And Tom who would love to sell Davenports company to the fucking Chinese if he could have five minutes alone with them so he could sign the papers. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's a... It's a... It's an autonomous franchise. Bullshit! It's an autonomous franchise. He knows. He will know. I don't, I don't wanna even be tied to this family anymore. You know, the word incestuous come to mind. - Yeah, you think? - I didn't wanna have sex with anyone. I didn't know he was my father. There's no proof to any of this. Diana's probably making the whole thing up. Oh, yeah? Well, like the night we spent together? - Oh, what now, are you - What the fuck? -saying you slept with Rory? -What are you talking about? - Him? - Why don't you tell them all, Rory? You slept with him? Rory? You fucking slut! - Regan! - What, did you fuck our entire -Come on! -family? Shut up, Tom! This has nothing to do with you. Goddamnit! So is Rory my father or is Glenn my father? I'm not your father, I slept with your mom last year. You don't look like a newborn to me. I'm gonna get some whiskey and a cigar. Oh, yeah. Have her DNA tested by all means. Glenn, do. But you know what? your two middle toes are webbed and so are Delia's. -Do not talk about my toes. -It's a coincidence. -Okay? That's a coincidence. -I'm sorry. Oh, really? Really? No, it's not a coincidence. But look, here's the thing, if you don't wanna take your relationship with me seriously and if you don't want to step up and take responsibility for your daughter, well then, your dad will. Because I will not... Delia will not be cut out of this family! And if my best option is marrying an old man... well, fuck me that's what I'm gonna do. Don't forget about the side project with Rory, 'cause then you'll have a nice fucking - Lear sandwich to gobble. - Yes, I will. - Fuck you! - Oh, this is nice! Okay? You just came here because you thought Davenport was gonna divide up the spoils between all of us, huh? You're here for the same fucking reason. Who are you kidding? That and you lusting after -your brother, that's fucked up. -Oh, fuck off! That's how you spell fucked up. Hello? What's the matter? - Diana? - Mom? Oh, my god. Diana, what is it? Oh, my god, you're father. Your father had a heart attack on the plane. - What? - Shit. Oh, my god. He died, he died. What... He... No... That's impossible. Oh, god. You okay? It's all right. It's okay, it's okay. I hang on to one vision. And that is, he who stops dreaming dies. He who stops hoping dies. So just hang in there folks. Contribute. Stand in a line to make a difference. And at the end of the day just get it done. No matter how we all feel about our grievances... there's no denying that we lost a great one today. Here, here. Well said. I'll drink to that. Yeah, I never thought much about it. I guess I've been caught up in my own resentments. You know I just remembered my fishing rod. Yeah, that was my favorite thing in the world when I was a boy. Davenport gave it to me. Maybe he had some business back in Toronto, I'm not sure. Or maybe he was just coming to see me I don't know. But he showed up at the house and we got in the car and just went out to a lake. Davenport knew a guy so he started talking to the guy and after a few minutes sure enough we were in a little fishing boat on our way out to the middle of the lake, you know. Just me and Davenport and this fantastic little fishing rod he got me. He had a little tackle box and box of worms and those nice little floats that bob in the water. And we just fished, you know. And then it happened. I got a bite or strike as he called it, fishing lingo. And then Davenport... he popped up and he helped me reel in this magnificent fish and that thing was like the length of my arm. And I remember him asking me, "You wanna keep it?" Of course I did, but... But he made me kill it. This slimy thing it was just trying to wiggle free in my hand. I was clumsily trying to, you know, whack it in the head and he pulled out a pocket knife and he showed me how to cut it, you know, make a fillet and gut it and everything. So we just went back to his friends property and... sat there under the stars and just... cooked the fish in a skillet with some butter, you know. Nothing ever tasted better. Davenport never spent any time with me when I was growing up. And I know you think that I didn't care, but I did. I had a pretty lonely childhood. But I do have Davenport to thank for my success. He came to New York one time and he whisked me off to Meadowlands, the... the horse track in New Jersey, and, uh... It's a fantastic place and he showed me how to pick horses, and we were at it all day long, we lost a bundle. So much money. And that was the first and last time that I ever used his money for any kind of venture. And I guess it was my introduction to picking winners. And I just moved from horses to stock market. And it's remarkably similar actually. So... thank you, Dad for... our wonderful day at the track. I bought my first bike with dad. I kinda tricked him into it, I told him I needed cash to get a car. He agreed to give me the cash, but insisted on coming along to meet the guy and he said he knew a lot about cars, and he wanted to help. So we get there and it's this middle-aged dude whose wife is forcing him to sell his baby. So we go out back... and there it is, this whole cool BMW. But I'm waiting for Davenport to just, likely unload. Just... just completely lose it on me. But he doesn't he just goes over to the guy and starts talking about the... the mileage, the year, the starter, the engine. All this stuff that I... I had no idea dad knew so much about... about bikes. So he pays the guy in cash and we get back in the car, and he says two things. He says... "You have to get a safety course and you're not allowed to die." I loved him for that. My dad story has to do with prom. I of course, wanted to go with Rory. Dad didn't think that was such a hot idea, so, you know, I get pissed off as usual. And, uh, I'm gonna make a moment of it, so I'll... I'll go with Mark. Mark's this absolute pig. I think I'm gonna bring this loser around and really piss old Davenport off. Mark shows up at the house, he's got this t-shirt with a tux drawn on the front of it. Dad thinks it's hilarious, right? Best thing he's ever seen. Invites him in, pours him a nice fine glass of whiskey, I come down the stairs. I'm obviously expecting a disaster and they're sitting there talking, and Davenport's in the middle of some frat story of his. They're basically best pals at this point and I'm getting really nervous because I don't want to go to prom with this guy. Especially if he doesn't even have the desired effect of pissing Davenport off. But it's too late. So we're off to the prom. It goes horribly and I'm probably drunk. And next thing we know we're back at the house parked outside in the middle of the night and... Mark just starts trying to fuck me. And I... I' m panicked. I... You know, I try to push him off, I mean, he's huge so there's not... There's not that much that I can actually do. And thank God. The car light turns on... and it's Davenport. He's dragging him out... just beating the shit out of him. I really didn't know Davenport had it in him. I mean, he was amazing, like a... like a trained boxer. He's crying like a baby. He's bleeding everywhere, all over his steering wheel as he drives away. And Davenport just stops... and he looks at me... and he says, "You okay, buttercup?" He straightens my dress and he walks me inside. For the record. I think we should just judge a man by his actions. So sure, Davenport was a great man. But I think he was just that. A man. Pros and cons. Flaws and all. And he is dead which is sad but I think we should just remember him for what he was. A man. A womanizer. A huge ego. A father. A benefactor, a mentor. Neglectful. Forgetful. Cold shoulder. But just a man... to be loved no more or no less than he deserved. 'Cause if you take away this legacy, the buildings and the wise words and the money, then what about the man is left for you to love? Father? Maybe. No more. Probably much less. I think that's a little harsh, love. No, Mom. It's what he deserves. It's what everyone really deserves. Honesty. A toast then. To the great Davenport Lear. -Davenport Lear. -Davenport Lear. I let myself in. I'm sorry if I started you. You should know I've just come from the hospital. They took his body there as soon as we landed. Oh, god. You should also know... something incredible has happened. They revived him. - What are you talking about? - What? - He's alive? - How? - Are you serious right now? - How? He's under observation but he's stable. Wait a minute, is this come kind -of joke? -You said he was lucid. I know you all have a lot of questions. We'll know in the morning. I suggest just... Just stay here and I'll report back first thing. Hey, Tyler, wait. I'm coming with you. Oh, my god, Diana. It's a miracle. What a fucking mess. Do you think they'll have the wedding? I guess so at some point. So you do love Davenport after all. Yeah, of course. I mean, he's my father. Even though he fucked you for most of your life you'll always have that fishing trip. Something like that. What's wrong? I just... can't be on my own tonight, that's all. Okay, uh... Mm. What are you doing? Oh, just please don't make me be on my own tonight. -I just want to kiss you. -You can't even be here. Why? My, my dad. - Hug me. - Diana... Oh, look. Stop. Diana, stop. I shoulda said something before but... the thing is, uh... I'm in love with someone else. Your sister. Make love to me. -Please, I need it. -Diana... I really need this tonight. You... - Please. - Stop.... - Fucking get off him. - Shit. - Oh, my god. - Get off of him. - Oh, my god, what are you doing? - Hey, what are you... Get off of him. Get... - Diana! - What are you doing? - Don't you touch him. - Hey! -You shouldn't be touching him. -Oh, my god! Get off me! Don't touch me! - Hey! Wait, Diana! - You fucking slut! -Diana! -Get the fuck off him! Fucking get out! Just stay out. So are we all headed to the hospital this morning? Davenport! Oh, my god. Let me give you all a hand. I can't believe they all showed up, Tyler. Oh, boy. What's going on? How come none of you are dressed? Aren't we supposed to attend a wedding? You nut. We're gathered here today in front of these sacred mountains in Maliwoo. The mountain of my people of the Chumash who lived and loved here. They hold witness to this beautiful union today. We ask mother earth that she bless this marriage with abundance and that you may grow stronger and more in love through every season. We ask all the forces of nature here today to bless this sacred union and we pray that you may always find love for each other in your heart. And that you may be safe and protected as well as your family. Aho. We are gathered here today to witness the marriage of Davenport and Diana. But before we begin, Davenport would like to say a few words. A hand, please. Thank you. I got it. Oh, boy. Always kinda freaked me, this close to the edge, I don't know. I guess I should thank you all for coming. Before we really get started and anything more formal than this. I thought that I might, uh... tell you a couple of things that I've been sitting on and kept to myself for a long time. I know Diana has told you all that, uh, Delia is my daughter. Well, uh... She's not my daughter. I had a vasectomy after Roselyn died so she can't be my daughter. And it's no disrespect to you, Diana. It's just that after my second wife died... I couldn't really bear to bring another life on this earth. And, uh, when I... slept with you those years ago, you were very sad and very vulnerable. And I couldn't resist you. And I'm ashamed of that. But I'm also a man and, uh... I always felt that you and Glenn had something going on with each other and, uh, Delia's toes. And so I figured that she was Glenn's child. And lately, uh, you know... have been thinking about... my life and, uh... what it's about. My finances, my legacy. God, that's a terrible word. I hate that word. But it's fact. I am vain. And my family. And that's why I brought you all here together, um, back to the compound if you will. And, um... The last day or so, Tyler and I have been holed up in a room over there because I had Tyler and Kent who I enlisted put surveillance materials all around the house and in the automobiles. Tyler and I have been holed up over there watching all of your, uh, -behavior and emotions and, uh, -Jesus Christ. just in reactions and it was nice to see. And it's amusing and interesting. And sometimes it's been very touching. But sad. I enlisted Kent because he's always had no vested interests in any of my finances or wealth or where it should go or his part in it or anything. So you can understand why I put him in the room with all of you. So he could bear witness to the eulogies, to the sincerity, to the honesty. And in a couple of cases real heart felt honesty... and sincerity. But throughout the weekend there has been a sense of... "What's in it for me?" A sense of entitlement. That disturbed me. I can honestly say that I feel that I've been able look into the hearts and minds, and in two or three cases the souls of each and every one of you. And I can say that, uh, I'm goddamn sure where we stand. Tyler. I think he's a manipulative-punitive patriarch. I've been kissing Davenport's ass for 20 years. I'd like a little piece. You wanted to have sex with your daughter. Rory, say you love me. My mom has a thing for you. And if my best option is marrying an old man, then fuck me that's what I'm gonna do. No, it's a... it's a... it's an autonomous franchise! Not fucking funny. Dad, can I just ask you a question? So the heart attack, there was no heart attack. That was all bullshit? Yeah. You got a problem with that? No. Just that our own brother helped rig it. I made it up. Wait a second, I was at the hospital with you last night and you were connected to a whole bunch of wires and tubes, I mean... - Rigged. - I thought you were dying. Why... why would you fake -something like that? -You went as far as rigging -that you were in a hospital? -Guys, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't know that he was going to -take it this far. -What the fuck? Were you in the fucking scam or were you half in on the scam. -I don't get it then. -Oh, my god. I didn't know about... What about the wedding? What about the wedding? Was there ever gonna be a wedding? After all we've learned about each other this entire weekend. The going back and forth. The inner twining. The emotions. You still think there should be a wedding? You're a bastard. No. Technically speaking, Kent, the son is the only bastard in the area. Thank you. How could you use me like that? Excuse me? Madam, who are you talking to? You can't even make up your mind between Glenn and Rory. What do you mean use you? What are you doing? Huh? I have a daughter. Not by me. You have a grandchild. I'll love her accordingly. She understands that. See. That's where you're wrong, old man. Who does this to the people he loves? I second my mom. I don't want anything to do with you. 'Cause I don't want anything to do with a man who treats his family like this. You're an unbelievable asshole Davenport. Really? Come on. You know what? I want to say I was sorry. -I'll pray for you. -Thank you, ma'am. I don't need prayers. Than you. Um, well. Here we are. You're the puzzle. You know why? You're a whiz kid business man. A financial probably genius. I don't know what genius really means. And so you should be the perfect person to run my steak. But you got a problem, boy. You don't like architecture. Not to mention you keep referring to him as the bastard son. Even though he, uh... takes part in this... insensitive and outrageous plan of yours. Only to see you fake death in a fucking hospital bed. You're the bastard Davenport. I may be a bastard... but the fact is you are a bastard. You know what, I'm tired of being part of this charade. So goodbye Davenport. It was... It was a great visit. And I am sorry to all of you because I didn't realize he was gonna go this far and none of you deserve this. I feel terrible. Davenport, look, I hope you know that-- Hey. You're done here. Get out of my sight. Now. Tell your story walking. Okay. -I want a divorce. -Good. You know what? You can break my heart. You're the only one who breaks my heart. You broke ours. You broke our hearts. I'm fucked. Don't expect me to work for this company anymore. I'm done. I'm so done, Dad. That's the word. If you go don't ever forget that word. Dad. I hope you enjoyed this. Regan, wait up. Bravo. Nice work, Davenport. You're leaving too? I have a flight in the morning. You should know, you booked it, right? That's right, I booked it. You still want something from me? Why, because I'm the last man standing, is that it? Maybe. You know why? 'Cause you got game. You got a shot. If you fuck it up, you're an asshole. You can keep the kingdom. May you reign for a thousand years. Gone. Gone! Can I get a ride? Where you going? i don't know. I just wanna go with you. i love you. Now, I've done some revising and I think if we cut some of the design flourishes and stick to the original plan, we'll still be able to come in under budget, which is nice. So what do you guys think? I like it. What do you think, hun? But it's not as creative as the last plan was, but... Yeah, well, maybe it's, uh, just a little more practical, you know. You never wanna let the architecture get in the way of the functionality. -I agree. -Yeah. I'm glad you guys like it. Sold. Sir, if I can begin by saying I know that SOM, they are angry - and it... it's my - Amelia, please take -fault. Please... -a seat. -I can make this right. -Please. Please, take a seat. Um, in my defense, sir, I've been loyal -without mistake for... -Tell me something, Amelia. How was your weekend? -My weekend, sir? I... -Yeah. Listen, we're just gonna... We're just gonna start over, okay? Okay, Mr. Lear. Oh, no. Please call me Kent. Well I've been with Lear and Partners for 20 years so, I'd say that most of my experience has been with projects on an international scale. Well, why'd you leave that company? Well, I, uh... I wanted to try and build something on my own. Even if it meant starting with something a little smaller. What makes you so sure you're qualified to renovate my basement? I'm doing rounds of the local architecture firms to see if anyone could use an assistant. Well, what kind of job experience do you have? The job's not for me. I'm just helping with the search. It's for a woman whose got a lot of experience working for a big shot LA firm. Does she still work there? No. - Hey. - Hi! Um, figured I needed a change. I would love that. I would really love that. I hope you don't think I'm an awful father. Well, you don't pay me to offer up my personal opinions. You sure as hell offer them up though, don't you? From time to time. Just had to stop waiting until I die. One of the problems with having... a successful... career, is that sometimes you raise children that never want to take responsibility for themselves. And... When I... When they were saying all those things, it broke my heart. It broke my fucking heart. You all right? So what are we gonna do now? Well, I got... one more thing to do before I die. What are you talking about? I want you to... What's this? Be the... trustee over my assets for five years. And when that time is done... Forgive me, I just gotta rest. -It's all right. -When it's done just make sure... that you divide it evenly among all them equally. And that, uh, would include Tom... Diana... my granddaughter Delia. And after that time delay... -You all right? -Excuse me for coughing in your face, oh. That will have been able to get their lives on track. And maybe they'll resist somehow the lifestyle of the easy money. Well, that actually seems remarkably wise, sir. Why didn't we just do this before? Son. Come on. I'm an old fool. Jesus Christ, don't be so severe on me. So what are you gonna do now? I got a specialist that says... I got about a year and... I just don't see myself spending all that time hooked up to a bunch of tubes and... uh, drooling in a bucket while people are... starring at me over my crib feeling sorry for me. Sir, you're really dying? We're all gonna die, Tyler. Every goddamn one of us is gonna die. Trust me. It's just that sometimes we get lucky. You get to choose where and when. And I chose today. What? I mean, this far... What are you talking about? Sit down, sit down, sit down. I got you, I got you. Sit. Frozen in time. Sit down, I got you, I got you. Got you. I got you. Listen. It's here. I can't get my breath. What's going on? All the drugs, that's what's going on. They're taking effect much quicker than I thought they would. Davenport... Oh, boy. I'm an old fool. Is heaven upon us? Not yet. -Look there. -Hmm? â™ª Hey â™ª Hey â™ª Hey â™ª I say now hey â™ª Hell yeah we gonna make it After while â™ª â™ª After while â™ª After while â™ª Now it's getting To the place â™ª â™ª That I can't show my face â™ª That doggone bill collector â™ª Come knocking everyday â™ª Lord know I got no money â™ª Today and my payday â™ª So honey go to the door And send that man away â™ª â™ª You can tell him What you want to â™ª â™ª Just make sure He don't come again â™ª â™ª Tell him when we get The money â™ª â™ª We'll kindly mail it in â™ª Right now everything's wrong â™ª But it won't be This way long â™ª â™ª I say now hey â™ª Hey â™ª Hey â™ª I say now hey â™ª Hell yeah we gonna make it After while â™ª â™ª After while â™ª After while â™ª Now all it need to do Is rain hard â™ª â™ª And get me off my job â™ª And we'll be back To eating harmony grits â™ª â™ª And ball corn on the cob â™ª Lord don't let nobody Take a notion â™ª â™ª To go on a strike â™ª I know we get so far behind â™ª Until we never get back â™ª Now I've got these Three little dollars â™ª â™ª That I keep buried In my yard â™ª â™ª But that's the little money I fall back on â™ª â™ª When the times Really get tough â™ª â™ª And right now Everything's wrong â™ª â™ª But it won't be This way long â™ª â™ª I say now hey â™ª Hey â™ª Hey â™ª I say now hey â™ª Hell yeah we gonna make it After while â™ª â™ª Yes sir, after while â™ª After while â™ª Don't like the way I'm living â™ª â™ª My woman don't either â™ª Be we rise above it one day â™ª 'Cause we're true believers â™ª But we've got to have A leader, yeah â™ª â™ª With a whole lot of voice yo â™ª Or we might as well Pack up our things â™ª â™ª And join The poor people's march â™ª â™ª I say now hey â™ª Hey â™ª Hey, hey â™ª I say now hey â™ª Hell yeah we gonna make it After while â™ª â™ª Oh, yeah after while â™ª Things got to change â™ª Can't stay the same â™ª But we gonna make it â™ª After while â™ª Woooo â™ª After while â™ª But we gonna make it
