I'm the one who can't take anymore. I love you. So we have to. I love you. I won't leave you, Julien. You know I'll be there. With you. I love you. Without your voice, I'd be lost in a land of silence. That's not very daring. - Love isn't daring. - Don't say that. ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS What time is it? Seven o'clock. Kiss me. I'll wait for you at the Royal Cameo, as usual. When it's done, drive over in your big car, pull up in front, and I'll get in next to you. Then we'll be free, Julien. All right. I'll be waiting. Waiting only for you. Thirty minutes from now. Florence. Genevieve. Mr. Tavernier? Can you stay a while? I know it's Saturday, but I have to finish something. Carala Corp. May I help you? Please hold the line. No problem. You know I'm always last to leave. I'm not to be disturbed on any account. Mr. Carala? Call for you from London. Very well, Mr. Carala. Never a polite word. Mr. Porphyropoulos? Mr. Carala is leaving for Geneva. He can't take your call. Very well, sir. Honestly, my dear Tavernier, you often keep me waiting. During the Indochina War, it didn't matter. What was one defeat more or less? But now you're in big business. This isn't a dream. They're waiting for me in Geneva. They won't wait. Here it is. This is most amusing. You're quite a fellow, my dear Tavernier. You act like a true friend. An interesting document, if you know how to read it. I knew I needed a hero in my business. A retired hero. This kind of work doesn't call for rag pickers but for angels. A paratrooper is an angel. - Your logic is - - Yes, I know. "Geological sections... soundings..." They do good work in counterintelligence. They know almost as much as the Americans. "Project Pipeline." They made a mistake here. They should redirect the pipeline towards Morocco. Longer, but more reliable. Is this all? Is this a joke? It's not a joke? Then what do you want? Money? You don't frighten me. I have enough enemies. I'm used to it. And you wouldn't dare. In war, sure. But not in serious matters. Don't sneer at war. It's your bread and butter. Indochina netted you how much? And now Algeria. Have some respect for war. It's your family heirloom. Where'd you get that gun? Who gave you my gun? Well, well. More lead to write more junk. The Captain must've dozed off. He's not to be disturbed. We can't all stick around till midnight. I'll call him. What if I stuck my finger in here? Mr. Tavernier doesn't answer. I know the Captain. All right, sir. Excuse me. He'll be right out. - Sir. - Hello, Maurice. We the last to go? Did you see Mr. Carala go out? No, I must've been doing my rounds. He must be gone by now. His train is at 7:45. Funny about the boss. He always leaves without warning. He hails a taxi by himself, like a thief. When does he get back? We never know that either. Last time, he went down to Naples to buy tankers. He might do it again. Can't you catch cholera in Naples? - Captain - - Not anymore. Good night. - Good night, Genevieve. - Have a nice Sunday. What's crazy is to imagine incredible things. And I really mean something terrific. And it is terrific. When you look things in the face. But you can't feel things like me. Sure, you're smarter than me. You read. It gives you great ideas. What a stupid-looking jacket! Say... it's Mr. Tavernier! Always parked illegally. He doesn't give a damn about tickets or cops. Hello, Mr. Tavernier. Doesn't he look smart? He fought in Indochina. Then he was in North Africa, in the Legion. Now he's in business. He's been buying tons of flowers lately. Look, a push of the button! That's the kind of life I want. It's old hat. What an idiot! Florence is waiting. My engine's running. Louis! Mr. Tavernier will give you a beating! - I doubt that. - You don't know him. He's covered in medals and scars. - Swell! - It's true! You couldn't do what he's done. Let's go eat. I'm starving. Every time we go out, you ruin things. Will you get in? Get out! If you have an accident, don't ask me for help. You get on my nerves. Everybody's watching us. Windshield wipers! Watch out, Louis! Julien! I thought it was you. My respects. Still happy with the baby? After all, a Renault Dauphine is a baby. Very happy, thank you. It's the Parisian woman's car. Happy, very happy. This idiot will drone on and on. Julien with that girl? Why? Yes, I recognized the flower shop girl. I can't believe it. That would be so shabby. He got cold feet. He couldn't pull the trigger. The coward. He doesn't dare be happy. My respects, Mrs. Carala. - Where are we going? - To the highway. I can imagine his face. Think he'll call the police? Let him do what he wants. We have to bring it back to the same place. It's rotten of us. We're ruining his weekend. "Jelfa Oil" - ever heard of it? Give me his gloves. Look! A miniature camera. A friend of mine got one just like this in Germany. I can't open it. Give me his raincoat. Don't leave fingerprints. It's not a toy. A revolver. A spy camera. Jelfa Oil. He's shady, this Tavernier. Maybe he's a secret agent? Look at the way he dresses. I figured as much. No calls for me? Take the night off. I won't be home for dinner. What are you doing? I could ask you the same thing. It's late, you know. Okay, run along home. Have you seen Mr. Tavernier? Sure, around noon. - And tonight? - Haven't seen him. Have you seen Mr. Tavernier tonight? He didn't phone? You gotta be kidding! We've been up and down this highway three times. I'm fed up. You either like cars or you don't. A Mercedes! A 300 SL! Foreigners! They're Danish. - No, they're Germans. Careful, Louis! It can only do 100. What a lemon. Tavernier sure can't pick 'em. Faster! You can beat 'em. - Not hurt? - I'm used to it. My first accident in this car. "Let's drink to that," as you say. Horst Bencker from Munich. My husband, Julien Tavernier. A honeymoon couple! Put the champagne in the fridge. Let's stay here. It's a motel. I read about them. They have separate cabins, garages - Listen to yourself! Remember: I stole a scooter last week. I may be wanted. They won't look for you here. And I called you Julien Tavernier. And the Germans? They're just Germans. Then you handle things. I have to keep out of sight. I'll sign in as Mr. and Mrs. Julien Tavernier. Spending the night here? No, I haven't seen those people again. Nor the other young man. But if you like - At your service. Mr. and Mrs. Julien Tavernier. Cabin 11, next door to Mr. and Mrs. Bencker. What an engine! Why is it tilted? - To save space. - Where's the carburetor? - There isn't one. There isn't? My dear Mr. Tavernier, you are my guest. I can't accept. But you must. I'm the sporting kind, and in your own way, you're a very good driver. Moreover, we nearly died together. Come. Go right in. My favorite champagne. We didn't have this brand during the occupation. - He doesn't like champagne. - How sad. Had I known you can't stand champagne - It does nothing for me. My generation has other things on its mind. Four years of occupation, Indochina, Algeria. To Europe! We had to be always on the alert. We fought hand-to-hand. With knives. Stifling heat, mosquitoes, tigers. And Germans. Germans? Yes, in Indochina, Mr. Tavernier. You must have seen Germans. Never. And in the Foreign Legion? Oh, sure. They were good soldiers too. Glad to hear it. I mean it. I'm not flattering you. There were even some guys who fought with Rommel. I have exactly the same one. But I forgot it in Antwerp at our friends' house. - Is it easy to develop? - Oh, yes. Anywhere. They even develop them here at the motel. Hold on. There are still three photos left. We Germans don't like war. Yeah, right! You talk just like the older generation of Frenchmen. We're just traveling businessmen. And a uniform for traveling tends to stand out. Louis! I mean Julien. What the hell do I care! You see, my dear Mr. Tavernier, war is not only horrible. It's a complete waste of time. Another one the Prussians got. But I'm not a Prussian. I'm originally from - The ladies stepped out. Let's get some air. "Nature is a fine consolation for mankind." Goethe said that. - I don't need any consolation. - He wasn't thinking of you. "Janitorial representative to the landlord." - Strong, isn't it? - Not at all. "We lose our strength along the way." Don't worry about the ladies. You ought to try underwater photography. I have a charming cousin, Ludwig Von Malhausen. Know him? You must have seen him in Capri. He's always there. What did I tell you? "Then one could still laugh at the game." My dear Mr. Tavernier - whose name is not Tavernier and who's never been in the army - please don't get sick. Come now. Don't get struck by lightning. You gave us a good laugh. We'd better go inside. They'll get drenched. Serves them right. I took your queen. What a funny little Frenchman. What's his name again? Tavernier. Come to bed... Julien Tavernier. Julien... I've searched all over for you. Have you seen Julien tonight? Tonight? I don't think so. I lost you in the night, Julien. I should have left you alone. I shouldn't have kissed you or caressed your face. If you didn't kill Simon, never mind. If you were afraid, so much the better. But you must come back. I must have you here alive, by my side. I must. I must. I know you. Christian Subervie. A friend of Julien's. We all went out one night. I vaguely remember. You were a bit drunk. I'll say I was. You can't rely on that Julien. We met in Algiers. You were an officer? I was in the refrigerator business. He must be with a broad. He's neglected all his pals. Yvonne, honey, a drink. Buy me a Royal Cocktail, Christian? I'm with a friend of Julien's. I saw Julien. A Royal Cocktail for her. I said a broad... I saw him drive by. He didn't even look at me. Tonight? No, I think it was last week. Julien doesn't give a damn about women. Julien's sweet. Wake up. We're leaving. - We sneaking off? - Quick, while it's still pouring. I'm ready. - Where are we going? - Just walk. Louis, are you crazy? Lay off me! Just get in! It'll serve the bastards right. We have to cover our tracks. A problem with the gearbox? Looking for first? I hid it. Hands up. Don't come any closer. Let's get out of here. Leave the car on the bridge. We'll walk to my place. The raincoat! I'm done for. You were scared. You'll say you were scared. I wasn't afraid. But he kept coming. If only there hadn't been that gun. They're dangerous. Think they're both dead? Surgery works miracles now. Even for the heart. - My head will roll. - Stop it! We still have a few hours, and then - What will they do? They'll separate us. You'll be with the men, and me with the women. I don't want that! We'll only be together in the headlines. People who read them will understand. Understand what? Everything. - Your head won't roll. - I'm old enough. I don't want them to hurt you! I won't let them! We'll never be apart. If we had money, we could escape to South America. Our picture on the front page. "The tragic lovers." You'll get off Scot-free. You didn't do anything. But my life ends in the morning. No, I'll stay with you! You don't know the police. No, Louis. We'll be stronger than them. We'll die together. - When? - Now. I have what we need. You'll see. We won't feel a thing. We'll fall asleep right away. People will talk about us. We'll be an example. The music will keep playing, but we'll already be dead. - Listen - - We have to. I know we have to. Shut up back there! A whole night looking for Julien like a madwoman, knowing nothing, finding nothing. My feet are cold. Get a move on! This place is crawling with cops. Florence Carala. As in Carala? There aren't that many. He's my husband. What? Are you Mrs. Simon Carala? - Do you disapprove? - Drop it, old man. What were you doing out at 5:00 a.m. without ID? Going to mass. - With him? - Obviously. Excuse me, Mrs. Carala. I'm so sorry. It's all a mistake. Give us a break. Don't grovel. Carala's just an arms dealer and an asshole. Get off my back! - I'll handle him. - All right, madam. Phone my home for my driver. Right away. You're right at home here. On mornings like this, yes. Julien too? He's my pal. He doesn't let the cops off the hook. Maybe he's at another station? Could be. We oughta go see. Stay where you are. - He must be thirsty. - He can wait. That's not nice. Captain Cherier, Homicide Squad. Just upstairs. Pleased to meet you. I hope your husband won't blame the police for something so stupid - My husband's in Switzerland. He needn't hear about this. Of course, madam. There won't even be a record. I should hope not. My husband often lunches with the interior minister. Of course, madam. Mr. Carala lunches a lot. His business calls for it. For instance - For instance? Does he have an associate named Julien Tavernier? I think so. You see? Maybe you know him. I've met him a few times. Could you be more specific as to when you last saw him? Funny you should ask. I saw him last night in his car. On Boulevard Haussmann. - At what time? - 7:00 p.m. No, it was before 7:00. Before 7:00. Of course. Was he alone? There was a young woman with him. Why "of course," Captain? The fact is that without meaning to, you've just helped out the law. We're looking for Tavernier for a murder committed at 4:00 a.m. - A hell of a guy. - Whom did he kill? Mr. Carala will be sorry to hear he killed two German tourists. Nice work. We found his raincoat, his car and his gun. He was with a young woman. That makes your statement terribly interesting. Got a cigarette, honey? Again, we apologize for this mix-up. I hope Mr. Carala - Monsieur didn't phone from Switzerland? No, madam. Drop Mr. Subervie off, then take me home and get my car out. I look awful. I'm mad. You're in the presence of a representative of the law. I took the trouble to come in person. The same morning. And on a Sunday! You must testify in all honesty. There was a storm. We couldn't sleep. I recognized the silhouettes. It's hard to say. Did you see him or not? Yes, it must be him. Next. The fact is the presumed killer didn't come to the reception desk. But I saw the unfortunate victims quite clearly, and the delinquent who signed in for her accomplice. If you have a photo, I can - You can make inquiries. I've never run afoul of the law. No need. Next. I warn you, Captain - I'm not the captain. I'm the assistant district attorney. Your ID papers? I protest against this intrusion. My private life is a public matter. I'm Jacqueline Mauclair. That doesn't change a thing. The journalists insist. Journalists never let up. Well, let them in. You may go, madam. One of you once recalled I tried to enter the Ecole Normale before deciding on a law career. Well, this new Drummond affair is like a classical tragedy that will unfold over 24 hours. The crime was committed last night, the murderer was identified this morning and will be arrested tonight at the latest. Terrific! We're dealing with a certain Julien Tavernier, an ex-officer, in the paratroops. His car, his gun and his raincoat are in our possession. Witnesses have identified him and the woman who was with him. As for the motive for this insane act, there are several. Tavernier drank. He was quarrelsome. He got into several brawls in his time. But I think this is only a partial explanation. The Germans' cabin was next door to Tavernier's. The proximity made things easy. And the victim, Mrs. Bencker, was very young and very lovely. - Can we see the body? - There's no need for that. We'll know everything once the murderer talks. The law will act with lightning speed. Having rushed right down here, I was able to observe - Ah, Cherier. Here so fast? That will be all for today. The killer, ready to go. This stupid crime's mucked up our front page. You think you have every right! It's here. Captain Tavernier a murderer? You police get crazy ideas. Give it a rest. I'll have to turn on the power. Police or no police, Carala doesn't like snoops. Coming here on a Sunday! The cops took it. It's enough to make you sick. It makes me sick to see this. Where did he go now? Funny, he never locks it. Well, I'll be! What d'you know! Well, I'll be! Hey, officers! You didn't come for nothing. There's a dead man upstairs. The boss. - The boss? Mr. Carala. Looks like a suicide. Mrs. Carala, please. She's asleep? Let her sleep. I'll call again. Gaston. I'm hungry. Bring me a large coffee and lots of croissants outside. I'll call the police. It's the same man, Daddy. Look. Isn't that the same man? Keep quiet. It's the same man, Daddy. It's the same man, I'm telling you. Come along and be quiet. TWO GERMAN TOURlSTS BRUTALLY MURDERED TAVERNlER THE MURDERER Don't stand here. Let's go. Now let's try to agree on something. You left the Carala building at 7:30. That much is clear. The doorman and receptionist testified to that. You didn't leave your office before then. Then you got in your car and drove. - I didn't take it. - We have a witness. Well, they're wrong! Or else you're lying. Okay. Fine. Want to keep playing? Let's play then. You recognize this revolver and this raincoat. I left them in my car. In your car. Of course. How many bullets were in it? It should've been full. You left this lying around too. Very careless of you, Mr. Tavernier. What part did you play in Carala's business affairs? I'd go see people. Important people. I'd talk of Mr. Carala, and they'd all start to grovel. But you see, Tavernier, there have been developments. It's plain Carala now. Developments? You can't be everywhere at once. You were happy working for Carala? Or Mr. Carala. That's my concern. - And - - And? I had other jobs before. I know. Of course. You know the Trappes Motel? - Never been there. - You were seen. I can't help that! Why not Berlin or Casablanca? - Where were you - - I don't know! I think I was drunk - - At the Trappes Motel. In Paris. I walked around. This is all very nice, but there's a slight program change. The witnesses at the motel may not be certain, granted. But that's not all. Here's a little riddle for you. Do you know a lady, very elegant-looking, who's a bit of a night owl? Who do you mean? My motel accomplice? I'd like to meet her. Not at all. The person I have in mind is Mrs. Carala. I hardly know her. That's perfect. Mrs. Carala claims she saw you early in the evening driving down Boulevard Haussmann with a girl. But you don't know Mrs. Carala very well. She doesn't know you well either. But she recognizes you. And for once the witnesses agree. Isn't that the case? But it's not true. It's not possible. I was somewhere else! Are you sure? Let me sleep. We'd like nothing better, Tavernier. Sixth round. Go to it. Where were you Saturday night through Sunday morning? I don't know. So... still won't talk? Suppose I tell you where I was. Anything's good for an alibi. Wives, girlfriends, bartenders, childhood friends, deceived husbands - but not an elevator. That's ridiculous. You think so too? It's totally harebrained. That won't fly, Tavernier. Everything points to you. Your elevator story will have a jury in stitches. You're out of luck, old man. By the way, bad news - Mr. Carala was found dead in his office. Suicide. What do you think? Let me sleep. I'd really like to know what Mrs. Carala thinks. We're getting sidetracked. Where did you spend Saturday night through Sunday morning? This suicide upsets me no end. I'm literally thunderstruck. Our chairman, your husband, was such a dynamic personality. Thank you for seeing to the details. It's only natural. As for the firm, I'll defend your interests. It's a bit too soon, but we must think of it. And that horrible motel murder the same night! Strange man, Tavernier. Let's hope they find him and his accomplice. It's bad for tourism. - May I? - I'll escort you out. - No need to. You're busy. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll save you, Julien. Would you like an azalea? - Is your salesgirl in? - Veronique? On a Sunday? She has her boyfriend, movies, dancing. Look at this one. - So her name's Veronique. Where does she live? - In a maid's room in the 15th. Did she do something wrong? - Where, exactly? Boulevard de Grenelle, I think. Number 55. I recommend this one, if you like this rare shade of pink. It's lovely. Miss Veronique? Last door on the right. Last door on the right! Who are you? What do you want? It's not lethal. You took too much. Being so inept can be a lifesaver. You're just children. You don't know what Gardenal is. Leave us alone. You stole the car, and you killed the two Germans. She's been identified. It's in all the papers. - What's it to you? - I need you alive! To prove these are lies! All lies! Don't try anything stupid. The newspapers. What do they say? A lot of nonsense. That's not my picture. It's Mr. Tavernier. In that case, it's not me. It's him. It's Tavernier. It's Tavernier. That woman told us a pack of lies. That's right. We're saved. We didn't die for a good reason. But you - They saw you there. The photos. It's his photo in the papers. The photos of the Germans. - What photos? - The ones we took at the motel. Look, I still have the ticket. Damn! I'll go get them. It's the only evidence. The spare key's in the drawer. She's a tenant in the building. 55, Boulevard de Grenelle. Maid's room 23. He's drugged, I said. He took Gardenal. He's the motel killer. He confessed to it all. I know what I'm saying! What does it matter who I am? Too bad for you if you're so stupid! You do the photos here? So there you are. You too? Step right in. That's not all. You see, madam, there are always several photos in a camera. Sure, Tavernier didn't kill the Germans. But he's charged with killing your husband, Simon Carala. And you're charged with being his accomplice and more. Never leave photos lying around. You ought to thank me. For the Germans, he had no alibi. He'd have been sentenced to death. For your husband's murder, he'll probably get 10 years. Ten years. But he'll only do five. But you, Mrs. Carala... I don't think the jury will go easy on you. And quite rightly. ...20 years. No more aging, no more days. I'll go to sleep. I'll wake up alone. Ten years, 20 years. I wasn't indulgent. But I know I still loved you. I wasn't thinking only of myself. I'll be old from now on. But we're together here. Together again, somewhere. You see, they can't keep us apart.
