[♪] Your Honor, these men should receive the maximum punishment. Their guilt is proved by the evidence and by their evasive attitude. Just look at them. Remember, you have sworn to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. Now, were you or were you not on the night of June the 13th in Mrs. Throttlebottom's chicken coop? Certainly not. I was in the house. What house? The doghouse. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Oh! Mr. Prosecutor, you have not proved that those men were actually in that chicken coop. Your evidence is purely circumstantial and insufficient to warrant a conviction. What's he talking about? Quiet. He means we ain't guilty. Oh, boy. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [WHIMPERS] Dandruff. Heh-heh-heh! JUDGE: And in the future, Officer Kelly, don't come cluttering up this courtroom with flimsy charges. Case dismissed. Hmph! [SNAPS] [SNAPS] [SILENCE] [RATTLE, SNAP, SILENCE ] Hmph! Oh. Nyuh-uh. Hmmm. A "barracud-ey". And what a cutie. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Now go get me a freckled trout. Shh. Jiggers. [WHIMPERS] Oh, a cop, eh? Oh! Hmph! Pushing people, huh? You see that? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [BARKS, SPUTTERS] You know, all my life I wanted to sock a cop right in the nose. Watch this one. You see that? Oh, I showed you that before. But I got another one. [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS, WAILS] Come back here, you--! Come here! Get out of the way, would you? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Step right up, folks. As you can see, the little lady is in this cabinet. I shall now close the door, and crossing to the other cabinet, I shall fire the magic gun... And what have we in here? A little lady. [CROWD LAUGHING] Oh-- Hey, this is private. Hmph! Well-- Ha-ha-ha-ha! The little lady picked up a boyfriend on the way. Well, I'll take him away from her. Again firing the magic shot... [GUNSHOT] We have now in here-- Don't tell me. This is the safest place. Shut up. There's no room for an argument in here. Oh, there you are. Let me through here. [ALL WHIMPER] Open up, you guys. You're under arrest. Come on. [CROWD CHATTERING] MAGICIAN: Say, what is this? I pay a license so I can stand out here on the streets and sell my wares. Come on. Oh! Quick, get in the back of that truck. [CURLY WHINES] [BARKING] Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Let it go. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [SCREAMING] Oh! What the--? [GRUNTS] What--? [TIRES SCREECH] Hey, why don't you call your stops?

I wonder where you shut the water off. I've got an idea. What is it? Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water That's it. That's what? Water always runs downhill. On your way. Where? Up the hill and shut off the water. O-o-o-okay. Get me a wrench for the pipe. Give it a tap and get things started. What's the matter, muscles? You weak? Hit it. Hey, you smoking?
