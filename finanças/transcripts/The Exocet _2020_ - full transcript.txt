Fuck! Idiot! Another take, hurry up. - Shit! - Fuck you! Enough! That's enough! You're just an extra! Don't act mighty. Only 300,000 rupiahs, you jerk! - Come here, bastard! - Don't! You're always in trouble. When will you pay your debts? I'll pay them off! Mr. Roy! Hello! What are you shooting? - Only commercials. - I'm producing a lot right now. - Do you want to do casting? - Of course! Did you bring a photo? Yes, but not a full-body one. Can you take your clothes off? Yes. Can you unzip your pants a bit? It's client's request. Good. Might as well take them off. - Bullshit! - Oh, my God. Hey! I'm not your jerk-off material, bastard! You dickwit! Whatever, you're not the only one. I have a lot, dear. Baby! - Candies. - Got it. Hello? Oh, okay. I've finished two earlier. What do you need? I've sent it. I've sent it! What did you use it for? What do you use that much money for? I've sent it yesterday! Whatever! It's 134,000 rupiahs. This fucking car. It's broken again. What's wrong? It broke down. Do you want me to push it? But pay me. I have no job. There are a lot of jobs in Jakarta, buddy. You just need to put in effort. Do you smoke? Baby. Your car is broken again. Gosh. Okay, get in. I'll push it. Hey, can you help me? Pay me. You do it first before asking for money. This is Jakarta. - Okay, do you want to help me? - Pay me. - Is it on neutral? - Yes. One, two. Is it on neutral? Yes! Isn't it? - Is it right? - Again. One, two. Damn, just 5,000? Well, do you know a place for me? I just ran away. The rent is around 300,000 rupiahs. Let me join. Fine, get in. It's so hot. Hey! What's your name? It's Dom, man. - Dom. - Dom. - From Manado? - No, Padang. Have you lived in Jakarta for a long time? Kind of. Are you really an actor? Yes, I am. But I'm still trying out. What kind of actor? What movies are you in? Take him to Ratih. Good morning, ma'am. - Here. - Oh, Pinkan. This guy is looking for a place. Isn't the one next to mine empty? Yes. Yes, hopefully you'll like it. I'll leave him for now. Thank you, Pinkan. - What's your name? - Dom. How long will you stay? Do you have a job? A month for now. I have a job. What is it? Your job? Actor. But I still have to focus. The one in 403 also said the same. But every time I pass by there, all I hear was... As long as you don't do drugs. ID card? Raids happen a lot here. I have to protect my environment. Pay rent every first day of the month. That doesn't include electric bills. There's a laundry below if you want to wash and iron your clothes. The key, ma'am? What's the hurry? Hey, don't get in! Here. Number eight. It's still furnished. The previous tenant disappeared. Just use them. I think, I'm quitting. Idiot. Do you think it's easy? Shit. You still have to deliver it. Buddy. Roni got caught. That idiot must've met up. I've warned him. Shit. What should we do? I'll take care of it. Do you want me to undress now? You are jerking off... Your knee must be wobbly. Couldn't you knock? Is that a problem for you? Here. Hey, cheap! Put on your clothes! Your tits are small, stop showing off. Why? Blue balls? Do you want me to help you masturbate? You're crazy. Don't dream of it. Give me one. I'm out. Roni was caught. What? How? What do you do, man? Barber. And a dealer. Do you need a guy? I'll join. - Hey! - Stay put. You're smart. Come with me. Not naked. - Fay. - Buddy. - Hey, Fay. - Pinkan. New neighbor. - Dom. - Fay. My new guy. I see. - Artist manager and a dealer too. - I see. Yes, Mr. Buana? What? It's still 7:00 p.m., isn't it? - It's still early, sir. - Excuse me. Thank you, miss. Cuddle? Sure, if I'm not tired. Excuse me. Oxtail soup. There's a DJ? Oh, sure, when... Bastard! Your spaghetti. Bitch. Fuck you. Fuck! I'm watching porn! Just come in already. Close the door, don't just stand there. - Should I lock it? - Yes. Sit down here. - Look at Radit. You want to learn, right? - Yes. This is your phone. Whenever you're working, broadcast your code. "Jakarta." Then list the names. Who will take it first? Deliver them in the morning. Even safer during Friday prayers. Act normal like you're not carrying. You said you're an actor, right? I need your acting skills here. Use your intuition. Whether to carry or not. You have doubts? Leave it. So many have been arrested, Dom. I'm not kidding. Never go face to face. Never give away the color of your clothes. Direct call only. Once it's done, ditch the SIM card. - Do you understand? - Yes. One more thing. Never reduce the item. Your deeds in the afterlife would be reduced too. I think I've seen you before. I don't know where. - Your coffee is in the cashier, baby. - Okay. Your lunch will be brought here. Eat it. I've understood how you work. Don't be a smartass. There have been many arrests. Brain alone isn't enough for this. It's your feelings that you should hone. That's the most important thing. If you have a bad feeling, just leave it. How long have you been a dealer? Around 20 years. Since I was 15. Then I became a DJ. I taught my man. I opened the barber shop for him. He actually lives off of me, right? But he's grumpier. What a dick. But his dick is too good for me to leave him. I'm sorry, man. Can I pick up the phone first? Hello? Really? So why are you calling me, idiot? Ditch the SIM card! Ditch it! This asshole. - Wait a second, okay? - Okay. Dom. You carry it tomorrow, okay? Putri got caught. Do you understand, right? It's dangerous these days. WHITE SHIRT, A DOZEN Hello. I'll do Pasar Baru later. Just wait there at seven o'clock. Okay. LORENTZ REFLEXOLOGY Relax. I just wanted to check whether you're safe or not. Now, we party in my room. Let's go. I want to learn to stop running away from what makes me uncomfortable. That I actually really want to be on stage... in light and darkness. Musically? This asshole. Get in. Hello? It's 305. Yes. Someone is coming soon. Yes. - Wagyu beef burger? - Yes? Burger? I didn't order any. Wrong room, probably. Yes? Wagyu beef burger. I told you, I didn't order any. What burger? Oh, right. I did. Thank you. Bitch. She said she didn't order. You've all got the transfer list from me, right? If Tanta hasn't transferred yet, don't send it. Gori too. Hey. Remember to check on Rick. Be careful, play it safe. Buddy, I'm taking three more. I'll add them to the list. Okay then. I'll leave now. Be careful. - Duren Tiga. - Is that South Jakarta? How much? For one-day delivery, 18,000 rupiahs. Okay, that one. Hello, what's taking you so long? The longer, the better. I left it under the groin of the sleeping guy, he's wearing Vans. Don't play with me. I threw it there earlier. What are you wearing? I'm wearing red, I just got off. Asshole! Yes. I'm on my way there. Not yet? It's all done, man. Take this to the airport. Put it on a Band-Aid on your arm, as if you're injured. Who's that? No one. Don't use your feelings. Cigarettes? You like this monkey, right? What the hell? Do you think I'm stupid? Don't be crazy. You're horny for him, aren't you? I took care of you and this is what I got? Don't be insane. Why are you jealous of the courier? Get out. You too. Now, you two kiss. Kiss her. Kiss! You're insane! Did you just get here, Dom? Yes. Yes? Who are you looking for, sir? Is your mom around? No, she isn't. Here, here. There. Eat up. Okay, sir. Who are you with at home? Just my little brother. What's your mom doing? She's working. She's working? What time does she come home? Probably... around eight. She'll pick up her boyfriend first. Okay. I'll go home now. Okay, sir. - Bye. - Bye. Under ceramic flowers. - Is it safe? - Well... Just like the usual. - Be careful. - You're lecturing me, now? You know me, brat. - You're not working? - Not yet, ma'am. You don't have a girlfriend, do you? From what I see, you're always alone. I will prioritize my work first. Find yourself a good girl. There's a lot of people who can't be trusted these days. Dom! I'll be going to work, ma'am. Yes. Hello? I'm near the ice cubes selling place and I'm wearing a black jacket. Okay. Buddy, they're not picking up the stuff. I have a bad feeling about it. All right. Leave then. Okay. Bring him to the office. Poor him for replacing me. Forget it. It means you owe me your life. Have you ever thought of stopping? Bullshit. Why are you talking about serious matters with me? You said you're an actor. But do you have any common sense? What about dreams? Do you have it? Do you still believe in such things as dreams? Just like when you're smoking Mets, dreams are like the smokes coming out of it. If you burn it well, it'll produce a lot of smoke. It'll be beautiful, just like your dreams. But if you don't burn it well, you'll just feel the bitterness. And I think life is not about dreams. But it's about a journey to this one point. Because we're stuck in a concept of reality, time... You can't skip the time or go back to the past, you just need to face what's in front of you. Screw dreams. 2019 DREAMS, A LOT OF MONEY DOM LOVES CHELSEA ISLAN ACT IN A MOVIE, MEET CHICCO JERIKHO JOKOWI IS FOREVER BE BETTER! Do you really like to watch dramas? Not really. Then why did you watch it? For a laugh. - I'm Khansa. - I'm Dom. Where do you work? - I work at the hospital. - Hospital? Are you a doctor or anything? - I'm a funeral cosmetologist. - A funeral cosmetologist? Do you do that alone or with another person? - Alone, of course. - Alone? Aren't you scared? Why do I have to be scared? They're dead. You're right. This is my work. Why is Bang Gorik's photo there? He consumed too many Mets. The family didn't even tell me, but I knew. It was hard to dress him up. His mouth tilted a lot. So I thickened his mustache to make it easier. It's so small. When you die, your resting place would be smaller, right? Maybe it's only 2 sq m. I'm serious, this is so scary. I told my problems to them. Well, no. Their family often give me tip, so I took their picture. Is that Chicco Jerikho or Rhoma Irama? Chicco Irama. INCOMPARABLE HONOR Don't use too much. It's kind of risky these days. Your lips will be tilted just like Bang Gorik. Relax. I'll just use some lipstick. But it'll feel like chewing betels. God must be sad. Where do you work? I'm an actor. Do you believe it? I put it all in the hands of God. I have no business in people's lies. For me, life is only a second from death. So don't ever regret it. People rarely realize that regret can kill their lives. You're an actor, right? If you want to be an actor, you have to memorize animal names. You'll remember them faster than human names. Here, in this boarding house, there are already three people named Sari. Sari Putri, Sari Madu, and Sari Purma. There are seven Andikas. Andika Qori, Andika Jayadi, Andika Top, Andika Bot, Andika Prasasti, Andika Purnama, Andika Purbo. For animals... Elephants are just elephants. They don't have last names. Oh, one modern elephant has its name. The Gajah Duduk. Silly. It's a sarong brand. I'm not wrong. Think about it. - How much? - It's 13,000 rupiahs, sir. Good night, ma'am! It's a great movie. What's your favorite movie, ma'am? Action. I like action movies. What about your favorite actors? Miyabi, Mia Khalifa, Sasha Grey. They're good at acting, right? Not really. Life movies shouldn't be great, they'll go nuts. Do you have mosquito repellent, ma'am? You like Rano Karno's... or Roy Marten's acting? Interesting. Who do you think is more interesting? Let me think about it. You're more interesting. Don't watch movies through illegal means, ma'am. The subtitles are not clear. I don't really think about it. Dandy, Vasco, and Didi. 5 g, 3 g, and 3 g. - Okay. - Okay. I'll be going then. - Be careful. - Yes. Buddy, I need 3 g for Donald. - Don't forget to put it on the list. - It's done. - Are you sure? - Yes. Why haven't you slept yet? Where have you been? I was working. You smoked Mets? What's with you? Pinkan. Is it that hard to respect me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Aren't you cold without your underwear? Tell that to your boss. I want to be free. I'm fed up already. You both are just too angry at the moment. Don't smoke too much. Yes, ma'am. - Here. - Thank you. - Yes. Keep the change. - Yes. Buddy, I'll be going. - Ma'am. - Dom. - Where are you going? - I'm going out. - Are you going to do prayers? - Inshallah. - So here, I'm going to start here, right? - Buddy! Buddy, sorry, can I take a photo with you? - I'm going to shoot in a minute. - Just a minute. - Let me handle it, sir. - Wait a bit, okay? Tell them to Robby. Okay. - Let's take a selfie, alright? - Sure. Yes. Buddy, you look like the actor who played Thor. Chris Hemsworth in Thor: Ragnarok. You're nice. I look a lot more like Thanos though. - Chicco. - Yes? A friend of mine is asking for a birthday message. - Really? - Yes. His name is Radit. - What's his name? - Radit. - Radit? - Yes. It's his 19th birthday. Hello... - Radit, right? Hello, Radit. - Radit. Happy birthday. Long live and a pleasure to meet you. - Is it enough? - Yes. It'll do. - Thank you, buddy. - Yes, you're welcome. Buddy, it's your turn. Don't put too much make up. - You've read it? - Yes. What about this scene? At the street, Mambo, when she comes, she'll grab your shirt. But only your right side will be punched because you haven't practiced yet. Because this scene is before the fighting scene. Okay. Let me add a bit on this, is that all right? Yes, sure. You can add some stuff. - Five minutes to stand by position, okay? - Okay. Enough, miss. Jul, the usual, okay. - Two, miss? - Three. - Of course, two. - I'm paying, okay? Okay. I met my idol earlier. - Who? - Chicco Jerikho. He didn't play in any dramas for so long. I miss him so much. Once, I was too horny... and I imagined Chicco Jerikho in my mind. I was so wet. Imagine me next time. - Here's your chicken noodle. - Yes. - You seem like a hypersexual type. - What? Because they said, people like you seem like a hypersexual type. - It's a stereotype. - Stereotype, my ass.
