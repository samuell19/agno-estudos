People Hopes Medals A hans schubert film People. Every four years, they meet at the olympic games. This time, in sunny California. Americans are stubborn. Once they get something info their head, they go through with it. Not even a snowstorm can stop them. Squaw valley lies nearly 6,600 feet above sea level in the Sierra Nevada. The risk of bad weather was enormous. At the opening of the eighth olympic winter games, the whole valley threatened to disappear under a blanket of snow. But the Americans, with their boundless optimism, refused to give up. Then, a miracle happened. Literally at the last minute, the sun broke through. This is the French team. A colorful picture. The swedes like lemons. South America is also represented at the winter games. While the ceremony is in full swing in the ice arena, the finishing touches are leisurely made fo the paintwork on the roof. The vice President of the United States, Nixon, opens the games. Thirty nations are taking part. And the olympic flame is carried down into the valley by American skier and olympic champion, Andrea mead-l.Awrence. It is passed to speed skater Kenneth Henry. The olympic oath is sworn by American figure skater Carol heiss. Carol is obviously conscious of her distinction. But the big show reaches its first, fascinating climax. Hundreds of pigeons spread the news of the opening of the eighth olympic winter games across the world. One lonely pigeon refuses, telling itself. ?I'll stay here. When else will I have the chance fo see the winter Olympics?? Very well then, stay where you are. Fly up to the top of the mountain, where the women's downhill skiing is starting. On kt-22 at an elevation of 8,070 feet lies the start The American penny pitou. Her crash helmet reminds us of something. Usually only jet fighters wear helmets like those. The final preparations. Gymnastics by rieqgqg of Switzerland... And Susan Holmes of england. The race begins. The downhill is expected to be a fierce battle between the /talians - here we see jerta schir... The skiers from north of the great I akes - here we see Anne heggtvelt... The Germans - Sonja sperl is pictured here... And the Austrians - here, Erika netzer. These are the anxious moments before the start the American, penny pifou, is the first fo go. The course from kt-22 is 1,800 meters long, descending 550 vertical meters fo the finish line. Slow motion. Here is the key section of the race, but penny pitou foughs it out and finishes with an outstanding time. Pia riva of Italy. The first section of the route is narrow and exceptionally steep. A great many gates were clearedq, 27 in total the Italian takes fourth place. Betsy snite starts her race. A slow-motion replay of the jump. This American had been expected fo have a chance at a meadal. Heidi biebl of Germany is at the top. The 19-year-old skiers section times are outstanding. She gets through this section without a fall, finishing with the best time. But the result is yet fo be decided. Putzi frandl of Austria is reaay. Putzi frandl manages the jump well, as do the two Americans, meyers and Hannah... As well as netzer of Austria. Netzer makes it down without a fall but is too slow, coming in at eighth. These steep slopes, with their many undulations, frustrate many of the skiers. Although the wide piste is prepared in exemplary fashion, there are lots of 1alls. Annemarie waser of Switzerland. Hannah of America. And now, a slow-motion replay of the most beautiful alls. There is only one thing fo say: Stars, all of them stars. The courage of the young women is truly astonishing. Traudl hecher is ready to go. Sixteen years young, from Austria. After a fall when out walking, of all things, she has to do her run with ice on her ankle. Even so, Heidi biebl's best time is unaer threat Only once traudl hecher crosses the finish line is the race decided. Bronze medal in the downhill goes to the Austrian. Silver for penny pitou. And gold for Heidi biebl of Germany. People, hopes, and if they realize these hopes, then medals as well The flag of the united team of Germany fluttered twice on the gold medal flagpole at this presentation ceremony. The second time for Helga haase, who won the 500 meters speed skating. People in the arena... On the ice... And in the stands. It is a curious world, figure skating. Have you ever heard of ice sport mothers? Here they sit. And here are the special friends of these ambitious mothers, the judges. Here are the mothers of kilius and bdumler... And here are their children on the ice. The ice rink was unusually small in squaw valley, even our pigeon felt it. Like virtually all figure skaters, the German pair suffered from shortness of breath. The altitude of the olympic resort is making itself felt. The free-skating routine met with approval, winning the European champions kilius and baumer the silver medal. Jelinek's mother thinks it's a very high score, as she waits for her children fo come onto the ice. A splendid double Axel, the most beautiful jump in the entire competition. Mommy is delighted. Maria and Otto jelinek of Canada, she 17 and he 19, both born in Prague, both exceptionally musical. And here is the death spiral, just a little lower. A little lower in the scoring, their mother has to double check. Only ranked fourth for the Canadians. Mrs. Paul and Mrs. Wagner await the next routine with confidence. ?Our children are three-time world champions, they're sure to pull it off.? Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul. She is 19 he is 22. She is short at 52? while he is 672'. It is clear that he can lift her like a feather This free-skating routine exudes Harmony, maturity and confidence. It must make one envious. Split jumps. A loop jump. A technically outstanding and precisely executed routine. A spinning Axel into a low spin. A masterful performance, ending with a particularly low death spiral. It wins the olympic gold for Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul. ?Our children, I say!? People in the arena. No people in this arena yet. And Wagner and Paul are interested in the arena for the next olympic games. We are witnessing a magnificent athletic event in America. Next time, we Austrians will invite the best winter athletes from 30 countries to join us in innsbruck, Austria. Austria house in squaw valley is the meeting place for prominent athletes. Heidi biebl is learning about the ski slopes in innsbruck. But we are still in squaw valley. This is the men's downhill course on squaw peak. The camel's humps... Waterfall... And the straightaway to the finish. This downhill course is beset with unimagined difficulties. First there is a small flood in squaw valley. The weather is very unpredictable. Rain turns info snow. It's a good thing Americans cope so well with the weather, even the young. Snowstorms and sunshine... The weather often changes in a matter of hours. Which is why some Americans keep their straw hats on when it's snowing. As long as they're not afraid of grasshoppers. The men's downhill is the next to fall victim to this outbreak of bad weather it must be postponed. The course infantry carry on working, even auring the snowstorms. But as on the opening day, once again the Americans were in luck. You can always count on sunshine in California. Admittedly, the downhill skiers await this downhill race, the pinnacle of the alpine skiing competition, with apprehension. What will the piste look like after such heavy snow? Will it be too soft or foo slow? The event organizers do a good job. Potential avalanches are blasted with explosives, and marines walk the course fo pack the snow. The big day has arrived. Slope manager Willy schaeffler making final course preparations on squaw peak. The downhill skiers get ready, here is hans-Peter lanig of Germany. The bindings must be secured carefully. Not a single speck of snow must be left on the boot soles, or the binding won't sit right. Willy bogner of Germany. The frenchman bozon taking off his over-trousers. A loosening massage. Oxygen, and then the great adventure begins. At 8,900 feet, in the icy wind of the summit, the race begins. Ander! Molterer of Austria, more nervous than ever before. Before he has even traversed the summit, molterer loses more than two seconds. Here is the long schuss at the summit, the only extreme steep section on the course. Next are the camel's humps... The small waterfall... And the big waterfall with the straightaway after the jump. Ander! Molterer is very slow, his skis are performing badly. It is only enough for nineteenth place. The only consolation for the Austrian is the exemplary support after his run. Willy bogner of Germany. Faster than molterer... He jumps very high on the steep ledges of this 3,000-meter-long course. He shows great character. The big waterfall in slow motion. Even so, ninth place for bogner. Next up, one of the favorites. The German downhill specialist, hans Peter lanig, weighing 187 pounds, is thought fo have a good chance on this flat course. Seconds feel like an eternity. After the first third of the run, lanig has a clear lead. Powerful jumping. Another jump before the big waterfall. Up and down in a low squat. Hans Peter lanig has the best time at the moment but plenty of big talent is still to come. Such as Roger staub of Switzerland, one of the most daring downhill skiers in the world. These high jumps cost him time, and the result is a fifth-place finish. The performance of the frenchman, who has been so successful this season, is awaited with great anticipation. Jean vvuarmnet gets ready fo go. The experienced downhill skier is 27 years old. Vuarnet was the fastest by far down this piste, which is as wide as a highway. It is obvious even fo the naked eye. The frenchman is the quickest passing the big waterfall. In a very low squat, vuarnet sets a new best time. An average speed of 88 km per hour is recoraed for his fantastic run. Al the start, someone has heard that many of the skiers have waxed their skis. Forrer of Switzerland waxes his skis at lightning speed. He has less than a minute, as he is next to start after frenchman perillat, who has already started his run. P?rillat, incredibly fast, has the third best time after vuarnet and lanig. Forrer is ready just in time. The Swiss skier is in contention for a medal, as the spectators at the edge of the piste can see. The big waterfall in slow motion. The longest jump. Nobody pushes as hard as forrer, but he is unlucky. In fourth place, the Swiss skier loses out on a medal by four tenths of a second. While vuarnet and perillat celebrate gold and bronze, the gleeful jumps continue on the course. The competitors with higher start numbers also manage the course without any difficully. Finally, there's just one person left to go, starting number 33, im gyeong-sun from Korea. He twists and turns, making his way down the course at a leisurely pace. He finishes last, a minute and a half slower than the gold medalist. So many were able to take part in this event, but it was bad luck for the injured American buddy Werner. How do the French manage their sensational downhill success? It is claimed they do it without wax. But that isn't true, as olympic champion Jean vvuarnet demonstrates. To perform well, you have to wax well. The female skiers have to know what they are doing when they are preparing their skis too. Waxing truly is a mysterious art... Although a few everyday items sneak in foo. When it comes fo waxing, it is important for this lady to follow a routine. The whole art of waxing would be in vain if it weren't for the experts, who determine the precise temperature of the snow beforehand. One of the best and most successful at waxing is Yvonne rieqg of Switzerland. That's why she races down the giant slalom as though chased by the devil. The course contains 27 gates, from papoose down to squaw valley, that is, from Indian baby fo Indian woman valley. Yvonne ruegg gets into difficulty at times, but in the end, the outsider recorded a terrific time. The first person fo chase this time is penny pitou. And the American, who already has a silver medal in her pocket, finishes just a tenth of a second slower than Yvonne rieqg. 'Silver again,? moans penny. Rival chenal-minuzzo of Italy is very satisfied with her performance. After a dazzling section time, the mother of two wins the bronze. When she hears the news, she almost faints with happiness. Gold medal winner ruegg may feel she's had a little luck in this race. For example, the Austrian Erika netzer had the best section time... But her race ended in a bad crash. Traudl hecher, another Austrian, was very fast. Then another American came down so fast that she was in the running for a meaal. Linda meyers. A broken collarbone put an end to her hopes. One of the few bad accidents. A thrilling and dramatic race comes to an end. The intense activity continues in the olympic resort. This is how they do things in America. Stamps instead of entry tickets. So, what shall we take a look at next? Skiing? No, we've just had that! Or speed skating? Or figure skating? Or - what is that? Oh, ski jumping! This is how the Americans see ski jumpers. A little more elegant in reallly. Taste is a matter of opinion. Especially in America! - What is he aiming at? - That could end badly. On the subject of ice hockey - Soviet union versus usa. The battle in the ice arena. The Americans already have a shot at a goal. There is great excitement. Now the Russians have a go... Unsuccesstully at first... But things don't get any better for the Americans in this fast-paced match. The players don't always know where the puck has gone. Here for example, fo the great surprise of the Americans, an American goal. The Russians then give the Americans the run-around. But the Americans have a cast-iron defense. Sometimes, you get the feeling that the rink is too small for the players. And even that nobody can be separated from the puck, not even record scorer bill cleary. It goes without saying that the ice arena is sold out, and the match is reaching its conclusion. We're info the last quarter. The Russians are still slightly on top. But the American goalkeeper works wonders. Sometimes, these goalkeepers have nothing fo do, so they keep themselves busy. Two Russians in the center like gummy bears. The score is 2-2 and the Soviet union is mounting the pressure. After a long time, the usa attacks. They look like they're going fo score and they do. America leads 3-2. A frenzy of joy breaks out on the ice. In the final phase of the match, the Soviet union again comes very close fo tying the score. But Jack mccartan in the usa goal is unassailable... And stirs the fighting spirit of the American team. The Russians go for broke and substitute their goalie for a sixth outfield player. But even this doesn't help them, after dramatic scenes in the final moments, the score remains 3-2 for America. The United States are unbeaten tournament winners, winning them the gold meaal in the ice hockey. People, hopes, medals. Disappointment, but also sportsmanship in the face of defeat these are the heartening features of these olympic games. We arrive in mckinney creek early in the morning. The cross-country skiers have set off through the woods of the Sierra Nevada. They have 50 kilometers ahead of them. Men, all in white, from Sweden. Finland in white and blue. They are all on the point of producing one of the most thrilling contests in the entire olympic games. Here is veikko hakulinen, 35 years old. He won the 50 km cross-country skiing mn 1952 in Oslo. This is sixten jernberyg. The Swede is in the lead. All too rarely, the skiers are granted short breathers like this one here. At the five-kilometer Mark, jernberg is still in the lead. But another skier is closing in on him all the time, hamal?ginen of Finland, with start number one. Hakulinen is also in pursuit of the Swede. Hamadlainen is getting closer fo the Swede with every minute, and rejects the catering. 'Tl drink it myself then,? says the official. The 30-second starting intervals are squeezing together. Jernberg of Sweden still leads. As the skiers pass the stadium again for the first time, hama?ldinen of Finland is now just 23 seconds behind jernberg. This is ham?aldinen. Another Swede comes through, Rolf ramgard in third place, 33 seconds behind jernberg. Hakulinen, also 33 seconds behind. And now sixten jernberyg, who is looking for a second gold fo go with gold in the 30 km. But jemberg's fast start cost him too much energy in the thin, high air. The swedes lead is getting visibly narrower. Vaganov of Russia, also in the leading group. Rdmgard of Sweden, technically weaker than his opponents. They are roughly halfway through the race, and hamd?l?dinen has just taken the lead. There are now two Finns leading, here ha?maldinen... And here hakulinen, 34 seconds behind. Lennart Larsson of Sweden pushes forward. Sixten jernberg is still losing ground. A brief dizzy spell for ham?ldinen lets hakulinen close the gap fo 23 seconds. Clear signs of tiredness in sixten jernbery. The Swede is already about four minutes behind h?m?ldinen, in sixth place. He can barely keep moving his legs forward. The top contest between the two Finns is in full swing. H?dma?ldinen wants to keep his lead. Hakulinen wants to take the lead. H?madldinen has a burst of speed. Hakulinen has a burst of speed. After 50 kilometers, there are just seconds left. A tremendous contest between the two Finns. Hamad?l?inen, who had start number one and never saw any other skiers in front of him, is the first to cross the finish line. He took two hours, 59 minutes and 6.3 seconds to complete the skiing marathon. He only started as the reserve, and now it's the gold meaal for h?ma?ldinen of Finland. Hakulinen, number 26, lost the dramatic pursuit by precisely 20.4 seconds. All the same, two Finns in first and second. Despite being beaten, hakulinen is still the most successful cross-country skier of all time. And here are two swedes sprinting to the finish. Rolf ramgard with number 16, finishing more than three minutes behind the Finns, takes the bronze. The Swede is utterly exhausted. Finland, Finland, Sweden. H?amadldinen, hakulinen and r?mgard. Finland also won the 4x10 km relay. Scandinavia triumphed in the nordic skiing competitions. Just as surprising, after the all-round test of the nordic combined event, was the sight of a German flag ascending the gold medal flagpole. Georg thoma beat all of scandinavia and Russia to win the gold. That was the sensation of squaw valley. How did Georg thoma manage it? Firstly, the postman from the black forest is in good spirits as he climbs the combined jump. Meanwhile, knutsen of Norway, the favorite in the competition, completed a jump of 64.5 meters. Next up was thoma. A ski-lumping record with 69 meters. Kochkin of Russia led after the first round, but in the second he jumped just 64.5 mefers, putting him well behind thoma. He is skeptical for the time being. The Norwegian, sverre stenersen, gold medalist at the cortina Olympics, poses no threat this time. Just 63.5 meters and poor skiing. The third round is about to start thoma glides down the track. 67.5 meters and winner of the combined ski jump, nothing can stop Georg. Barely finished jumping, he's on the cross-country course in a flash. The reporters are speechless. Fourth best cross-country time and sensational winner of the nordic combined. Now Georg is let loose. Barely over the finish line and he's already landed in Munich in the special olympic flying machine. A fantastic combination. Not just cross-country and jumping, now with flight. To thoma's fellow countrymen, who surely know how to celebrate the most precious and unexpected gold medal of squaw valley. Have a nice trip, Georg! Drive carefully! Because of your driving qualification. But what are we doing here in Munich? We have to go back fo squaw valley. Let's fly back over there. Over to the ski jumping at the big olympic ski jump in front of 30,000 spectators. The face of a ski jumper in the moments of concentration. People, hopes, and a competition that provides real men. Finland's juhani kdrkinen, world champion in 1958. 87.5 meters and fourth place after the first round. America's samuelstuen, of Norwegian descent. A 90-meter jump on his first attempt. A surprise fifth place. Kamensky of the Soviet union. Here he comes' 90.5 meters, third place. Yggeseth of Norway, 88.5 meters. Otto leodolter of Austria, also 88.5 meters, sixth place. But the aces are yet to come. Here is Helmut recknagel of Germany. More than 90 km per hour on the in-run. At 93.5 meters, the longest jump in the first round. After the German comes halonen of Finland, with a jump of 92.5 mefers, in second place. None of the jumpers uses the lift, as the muscles need to stay warm. Recknagel leads by 2.3 points ahead of the second round, for which the snow on the landing hill is packed down... And the in-run is shortened. Halonen of Finland in second place. It's time for the deciding jump. The jump is ready for torbjorn yggeseth. 82.5 meters, the best Norwegian, in just fifth place. Leodolter of Austria does not look very optimistic. But how wrong he was. This jump pushes him up from sixth place fo third. 83. 5 meters and a bronze medal. Niilo halonen, the same distance as leodolter, 83.5 mefers, giving the Finn silver. Now recknagel has the gold within his grasp. Invincible, like the first round. Magnificent in the air. An elegant, supple jump of 84.5 meters. Recknagel, a supreme olympic champion. Not everyone was able to follow the jumping exactly, some just had to look away. Now fo the ice princesses, who started their competition with the compulsory section. /t soon emerged that the many-time world champion, Carol heiss, once again could not be beaten. The judges realized it foo. The American's winning streak is no fluke. Figure skating is an American tradition. We can even prove it. This is 15-year-old American, Laurence Owen. This is her first time in a women's competition, and already she is in sixth. This is her mother. And her coach. Mrs. Owen was nine-time American champion. Figure skating is in the Owen family's blood. There is another daughter, maribel Owen, who is competing in the second American parr. Here is the entire Owen figure-skating family. And what do you think of grandma taking to the ice too? She is 79 years old. Once learned, never forgotten. Oops! But America's young generation of ice-skaters are worthy representatives of their grandmothers. As Carol heiss demonstrates with her olympic freestyle. A high Axel. Out of the parallel spin and info a scratch spin. Jumps are the 20-year-old American's forte. Four-time world champion alreaaly, she has never won an olympic gold. A layback spin. Seven of the nine judges rate her freestyle the highest... Making her the clear winner. And while the delighted American accepts the first congratulations on her gold medal... Breathtaking feats are performed on the arena roof. The trademark of Chicago. And from up there, spectators have the best view of the men's giant slalom, which is just starting. Pepi stiegler of Austria starts his race from kt-22. Stiegler is very fast and at the finish line is initially thought to be the olympic champion. I don't think so,? says pepi, '1 went too early at the start.? In contrast, Roger staub of Switzerland left too late. After each turn, staub always lets his downhill ski slide away from him. The second-best time, for now. Emnst hinterseer The Austrian is a giant slalom specialist. Nearly a fall. An outstanding section time is recorded at the halfway point. Hinterseer takes third in this race. Stiegler takes the news that he's in second with composure. After a correction to the start times, Roger staub celebrates first place. But the event isn't over yet. Willy bogner of Germany. Hollywood star Janet Leigh, crosses her fingers. But it doesn't help. Janet knows how difficult it is when she treads the boards with her husband. You must recognize the man: Tony Curtis. Having the name Tony doesn't make you a skier. It has been a big day for Switzerland. Gold for Roger staub. Silver and bronze for pepi stiegler and emst hinterseer of Austria. After the medal ceremonies, the vibrant life in the olympic resort continues. Sometimes, it was even possible fo get a real fright in squaw valley. The strangest and craziest things could be seen. There were even motorized cowboys. Completely peaceful, of course. Not a single shot was fired. Oh, but there was! But only on the speed skating rink. The race of races was the 10000 meters event. Knut johannesen of Norway wears the white Jersey. He is competing against the American Arnold uhrlass. They are sleeping through a world record. Johannesen beat the world record by almost a minute. The new best time is 1546.6. No fewer than five skaters beat the old record time, and 14 new national records were set one of which was Ross zucco, crossing the finish. The previously completely unknown American was so spent that he passed out after the hard race. Soviet hopes for success in speed skating rest with yevgeny grishin, on the outside Lane in the 500 meters. The Russian already won two gold medals n the 1956 games in cortina. Despite two errors on the final curve, grishin finishes in 40.2 seconds. In doing so, he matches his own world record, and, as four years earller, wins two gold medals. Jayne Mansfield is very interested in fast, strong men. It is little wonder, since she married a Superman herself. After the examination it's time for breakfast, iwo dozen raw eggs and a whole Turkey. The food for the athletes in the olympic village is just as good. There are tasty morsels for every palate. The portions were so large that some athletes were in danger of failing fo stick to their ideal weight. The spectators... Were not so well off, since there are virtually no restaurants in squaw valley. While some of the skiers are still dining merrily, others are looking for proper skis, such as the famous couple, penny pitou and egon Zimmermann. There are experts on hand for the skiers in the ski shed too. It looks as though traudl hecher has found the right skis. And now we go quickly fo the start of the women's slalom, where Sonja sper! Of Germany is starting her run. She completes her run without a fall, but is not fast enough, finishing eighth. The charming American, renie Cox. Just like the German, no falls but too cautious. Ninth place. Marianne jahn, an enormous talent. Just 17 years old, the Austrian has a fantastic style, a narrow stance, light in the hips, a wonaerful weaeln. First run, and second place. Annemarie waser of Switzerland is the most promising competitor in this race. But the slalom specialist had a fall on her first run. Another big name from Switzerland, Madeleine chamot-berthod. The olympic champion in cortina, was handicapped in squaw valley. As a result, she wasn't able fo seize her chance here. World champion inger bjarnbakken of Norway. She too, is in with a good chance at a medal but this time there really is a strong favorite. Let's see how it went for penny pitou. At this point, the American had already won two silver medals. There's only one thing to say: Stars, all of them stars. Stars at the start line foo. Anne heggtveit of Canada. On her first run, heggtveit was already better than the best time. Now, in the final run, she gives it her all. The Canadian is in the finest form of her life. Even so, the olympic title is still not certain as she crosses the finish line. Next is Betsy snite. The American, so far without a medal at these games, seizes her last chance. Betsy snite, even faster and even more aggressive than the Canadian. Third after her first run, now she beats heggtveit's time by a tenth of a second. Whether this magnificent run is enough to win the American a medal is down to the skiers still left to go. Marianne jahn goes hell for leather. With silver in the bag, she goes for gold. But a heavy fall near the finish line loses her the silver medal too. Heggtveit and snite know that barbi henneberger is the only one who can pose a threat now. The run by the stylistically excellent high school student is beautiful as ever and cautious. She takes the bronze. She didn't have to claw her way to it. She showed wise restraint, but a spirited side too. Betsy snite takes the silver medal... And Anne heggtveit wins the gold. And here is the unhappiness and disappointment, but it is impossible not fo find solace in bing Crosby. It was a magnificent race. Gold for Canada. Silver for America. And bronze for Germany. Sadly, the weathers taking a turn for the worse again, isn't it, grandpa? There are lots of sisters here fo look for the hall and for another reason foo. A major event casts its shadow before. Sport is becoming an artistic statement. David Jenkins on the ice. The three-time world champion was in second place after the compulsory section here in squaw valley, behind karol divin of czechoslovakia. He had to risk everything. He is gathering information. The American performs a sensational freestyle routine, the highlight of the entire olympic figure-skating competition. These flying sit spins are incredible. No one else could come close fo him. Magnificent scores for presentation, securing the gold for David Jenkins. There was even a perfect score of 6.0 for technical merit for this freestyle routine. People, hopes, medals. One last time, everything awaits the dance through the snow, the furious charge between the flags. People, skis and powder snow, an intoxicating combination for anyone who loves skiing. But that was just the introduction. Final preparations are made for the men's slalom. The route must be studied in detail Ludwig leitner of Germany... Hinterseer and oberaigner... Charles bozon. In the slalom foo, the question of waxing has a certain significance. Willy bogner, Germany's great hope. Filing the edges to ensure every movement has pinpoint accuracy. Exotic starters, one from Lebanon... And one from Turkey. Qur Korean is also here, of course. Former world champion georges Schneider is info gymnastics... Rather than lying safely in the snow. Olympic champion Stein Eriksen has marked out the course for the first run. It is getting serious. Willy bogner of Germany. Bogners father is very nervous... But dear old dad has no reason fo be, because the 18-year-old high-school student completes a magnificent run. Willy bogner gets down without any mistakes and in a brilliant time. Now, Roger staub of Switzerland goes in pursuit of bogner's time. The olympic giant slalom champion gets off to a dazzling start... But then he gets caught... And sends the powder flying. Emnst hinterseer of Austria. Fifth place after his first run, 1.9 seconds slower than bogner. Pepi stiegler, with safety bindings for the slalom too. Nervous at the start, but not once he's off tenth place in his first run. Francois bonlieu, happily chatting away. The frenchman is getting dangerously close to first-placed bogner. Exactly one second behind the German. That puts him in second place. That's the first run completed, bogner leads ahead of bonlieu and bozon. The skiers study the second route, marked out by Karl molitor. They seem calm and confident. Bogner father appears less calm. Igaya of Japan. Bogner leads by one second. While bogner's father and sister watch from the stands... His mother is too nervous fo watch. Good luck, Willy. The olympic gold is within reach. This run will decide it everything still seems to be going well. A spray (to the left, and he's on his back. But Willy bogner isn't giving up, though he knows any chance of a medal is gone. He regains his rhythm but gets into further difficulties. The German has another rall Bogner accepts defeat with composure. His fellow compatriot, Ludwig leitner, narrowly missed out on a medal with the third best time. Fourth place for the German. Excitement in the French camp. Here comes Charles bozon, third in the first run. While everything went well above, bozon was also lucky on the approach to the finish. Bronze for the frenchman. Emnst hinterseer The Austrian still has no gold to his name. This is his last chance. Hinterseer seizes his chance. A slow-motion replay shows his technique. After an outstanding run with the best time, hinterseer finishes top, moving from fifth to first. But he knows the gold isn't certain yet. His best friend is his fiercest rival, hias [eltner. The Austrian seals a double success for the red and white striped flag. Second place for hias leitner. Not least because bonlieu of France fails to complete his run. The frenchman falls in the same spot as Willy bogner. Many top skiers suffer the same fate as bonlieu... Such as lgaya of Japan... And georges Schneider of Switzerland. There was no end of 1alls. Children of the snow. It wasn't just the skiers falling but the spectators foo. Some people try sleighing... Others breaststroke. A gate post like this can be a magnificent lifeline. As long as the gateposts don't have a mind of their own. There is only one thing to say: Stars, all of them stars. Down at the finish line, a woman stands waiting for our Korean friend, im gyeong-sun. Here he comes. No, this is not in slow motion. Twenty-three skiers were disqualified, but not im gyeong-sun. He didn't miss a single gate. Then he finished with a respectable final sprint the plucky Korean makes it down with one pole. And in the end, it doesn't matter if you come 40th like im gyeong-sun... Or if you win a meaal. Taking part is more important than winning. And the mission of bringing together the young people from all around the world is the noblest mission of the olympic games, particularly in our time. People, hopes, medals. Unforgettable days of sport in squaw valley. You have been watching a hans schubert film
