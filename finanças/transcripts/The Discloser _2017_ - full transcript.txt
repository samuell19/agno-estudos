The film is based on real events, but the characters and events can be interpreted by the author. Directed by Hon KiSon. Well... Sorry, could you take a photo of us? What happened? Suddenly the case appeared. I just can't figure it out. What kind of military man is he who cannot solve the problem? What would you do? It is a matter of life and death. Fuck! Who sent you? There are a hundred people like you a day, so ... I am who you agreed to meet. Come on in. After Prosecutor Jung's words, I searched for some information on F9. The cause of the crash is poor visibility. But why is the pilot blamed? They say that the aircraft fell due to drunk driving. The warriors, as usual, try to get out of the water dry. For disclosure of classified information of the 1st degree to third parties - 20 years. For information leakage, they are sentenced to 10 years in prison as an accomplice. If I was afraid of this, I would not become a journalist. Internal accident investigation report . What is it? Captain Kang Yong Woo's internal accident investigation report . If the cause of the accident has been established, then it has already been made public. Not the slightest detail ... has not been made public. I'll start recording. My identity should not be revealed. You cannot even indicate the word "military". And do not show your face, and do not talk about the military. First, I will try to discuss this with the editors. Okay. I guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data of the informant. But if we want to convince the editor, then even I can't do anything. Top secret 6 months ago. Hey! What have you done that such pieces of paper come? What? Transfer notification. Will you go? What? This is an order, of course I have to go. If you want I can do it that you will stay here forever. Yes, I would not want you to talk to the authorities because of me. You are going to die in this field. Did I say that? Hey, it will tear. The family will be delighted. Well, go. I have the honor. Hey, Pak Deik! When you get directed there, people will not like it if you are as callous as you are here. And speak more politely. OK I understood. Don't worry about me. Is that so necessary? What an asshole. I have the honor. ABOUT! Why are you so early? What happened that you are so early and sober? What is the expression on your face? - Inyoung! - What's wrong with you? - What are you doing? - Kiss. Stop it! Oh my God! Enrages. Solve your love affairs not in plain sight. She scared me. Okay, Park Si Won. Daddy gave you this whistle in case you are in danger. - Or when you see a bad person. “But Mom was in danger now. Me too. Transfer notification. From April 14 the redirection order takes effect. Position... Manager of the Department for the Procurement of Aviation Parts under the Ministry of Defense. - Defense Department? - Defense Department. You? Whom did he bribe? What does bribed mean? It's all for merit. I swear! I am in line with the position I solemnly vow to report all cases bribery or waste of public money. I swear! Acceptance of the post has been completed. - Lieutenant Colonel Park Daeck. - Nice to meet you. Good luck with your work. - I'll do my best! - I have the honor. One year budget - 5 trillion. - List of issued items. - Hundreds of trillions. But there are only about a hundred people on the staff. How is it? Amazing scale, right? Wow. I have the honor! I have the honor! The head of the department, this is our new manager. The essence of military affairs is foreign capital. And foreign capital is the business of the department for the purchase of aircraft spare parts. - I'll do my best! - Working with me ... do you think you can just make an effort? Not only will I do my best - but I will do everything, even if my life is on the line. - And you are smart. Why is life? What time, you say, is the meeting today? - At 19:00. - Head of the department. You have a meeting with the head of the association. Attention. I have the honor! Welcome to our family. Yes thank you. It was impossible to concentrate in the common room for the soldiers . Therefore, it looks even funnier. Please retest. Check out our test documents. How can you do this? Who is this? Oh, nothing special. Well, come in. - Here please. - Thank. So, attention. Finally, the one you've all been waiting for. New manager of our department. Lieutenant Colonel Pak Daik. It's good that you came. I'm Hwang Chuim. Until the manager was here , these guys just as if they were orphans. Hwang Chu-Im, please take care of the new manager. Yes. Well, I count on your support. Applause. Wow, your daughter is just beautiful. Yes, but she behaves like a restless chicken. Usually these children achieve a lot when they grow up. How is it at school? Now we need to transfer to another school, but this is what her mother does. Do not worry. My family knows the local school well. The headmaster is a good friend of our department head , so there won't be any problems. Oh good blow! - The blow of the man who goes to the Blue House. Blue house. - Official residence of the President of South Korea I'm going because General Chon ordered. All my life I wore a uniform, I don't even know if the suit will suit me. What nonsense. Americans are going crazy while they wait for our answer. Not much time has passed since the change of the owner of the Blue House. - Isn't everything too noticeable? - On the contrary. It is important to fit in there while the mess is going on there. I have the honor. This is the new manager of our department. And this is the director of the personnel department of the Ministry of Defense, Kang Ho Seok. Pak Deik. We studied together. True? Yes it's me. Look for Captain Pak among the translated ones this time. Not? - What issue? - 38. Issue 38. Report to Colonel-General. Don't you go? I'll go first. Yes, MiRan, did a good job. Then maybe we are at the same time? Hungry already. Not going home? Manager? Don't you go home? What? God. It's been so long. - You can disperse. - Well done. The manager is still working, how can we leave? If you have finished your work, go home. Do not pay any attention to me henceforth , go home on time. Yes. Go on. - See you tomorrow. - Well done. What is it? Just for military expenses. Aren't they paid separately? Everyone here does it. I issued one in the name of my wife. Do you mean my wife? It's just that the place you occupy is very popular that's why such an idea appeared. It seems to me that it would be better not to accept it. This account was created for you personally by the head of the department. Just accept. This is required for the official documentation. Therefore, I ask you to sign anyway. River Island... Yes, the head of the department. No, I'm in the office. Yes, I understand you. Be back soon. And yet the signature ... Yes. And today we did a great job. - He said to come together. - Me too? Why call me? - Head Hon. - MiRan. Who did you walk with yesterday again? And don't ask. The head of the department suddenly felt bored at times in the Yajon market, where he comes from. We went there and drank until we lost consciousness. Gla ... The head of the department? What got into him? And I’m talking about that. I was away for a while in the middle. But the manager Pak will probably take a day off. Let go of me, it stinks. Good morning! Good work. - I called you from the department for the purchase of aircraft parts. - What happened that a man, who counts the numbers under the air conditioner in the office, Did you come to us personally? I came to keep costs down. You need a complete understanding of spare parts to place the correct order, right? And if there are losses, you need to find out the reason. Oh yes, this is for you. Over 30 years of experience as an engineer I see the manager for the first time. What exactly are you interested in? I'm technician Kim Chang-sung. - What is it? - Oh, this? This is called a cotter pin. It is necessary to fix the nut so that it does not dangle. Let her look like nothing special but it is necessary for fastening lightly loaded parts. Very important. Well... Not that ... You see, these parts ... What? Oh my god, oh my god. Has Captain Cha done something again? No, that's not the point. Foreign parts were compared with locally made parts. Oh, you mean it. There were no spare parts during the comparison , so the lines are empty. - Everything else was the same. - No, no, some lines are blank. You didn't even look closely. Airstar Inc. Нет Airstar Inc. Нет Airstar Inc. Нет. Airstar Inc. Нет Airstar Inc. Нет. If you look, there are no spare parts only for this company. Airstar. It is a very famous American aviation company. She didn't even stand next to the locals. Even so, only this company does not exist. - A bit strange. - Nothing special. You are just recently here, after some time, such things will not seem strange to you. Chief, you to the phone. - They say number 6. - Number 6? Yes. Yes, I'm at the phone. Yes that's right. What? True? River Island. Yes, I understand you. Yes. What kind of call made you so happy? - Nothing special. - It seems the opposite. Well no... The order came to await orders for a raise. Yes, you are rushing straight along the high-speed road. You are very successful. I'll go to the HR department. Stuck here for so long and still "Got you" I obey you. " What a man he is! What? You have the same shape, but he seems like a good person. This is something new. I have the honor. Next generation fighter plan . There he is. Chief, hello! Where are you going? Hello. ShiVon, hello! Here the beauty has grown. - Come on in. - We'll go bye then. - Here are the drinks. - We will. Mistress, come to us. Sit at the table. Sit down quickly. ShiVoni will sing for us. One two three four. I have the honor. Come on in. This is my wife. - Welcome. - This is the head of the department. - Congratulations. - Thank. Sit at the table. Come in here, sit down. ShiVon, come here. Thank. Yes, yes. I still remember most often repeated words. "Семья". "We are Family". I thought so too. These people are like family to me. No, they weren't like family. They were family. But you are going to betray this family. Sorry, I was too rude. Well no. That's all right. Betray. My name is Kang Yongwoo, I called you. And this is the representative of Kim. I don't know what the matter is, but honestly, I am embarrassed to be present at this meeting. If I had the opportunity to hold the meeting officially, I would have done it long ago. In order not to waste your time. What is it? This is FCS-81325 from Airstar. - And what should I do about it? - Outwardly, he looks normal. - But if you dig, then this is a pile of scrap metal. - FCS-81325 ... What have you decided with him? - Everything goes according to the procedure. - So you chose spare parts from Airstar? And where, then, is the documentary evidence of the tests? - The rest do not match. - Chief! Can you at least get acquainted with the research results? What should we do if we are told to include parts on the list, and we don't even know the reason for the inconsistencies. It was necessary to immediately do everything efficiently. What about Airstar parts? - How much did you get, why are you so concerned about them? - Listen. The lives of our pilots depend on it. Therefore, I ask you to pay attention to this. Blueprints came from the Ministry of Defense. And we did everything according to these drawings. And despite all our efforts, is our product inadequate? There were two F9 crashes last year. This is also due to poor visibility and inappropriate weather conditions. - And you believe in it? - If you do not believe, then do you think all the military of the Republic of Korea are lying? Captain Kahn! If you don't believe in the military, then quit! Go back to civilian life! Yet pilots end up dreaming of going into civil aviation. Military pilots are not like that. And Park Jun Young thinks so too. We must be in the service, defending the Fatherland until our death. I beg you. Retest. I had a feeling that something was wrong here, but then ... I just didn't hear him. To match American military strategy developing new era warplanes, our government has decided to purchase 40 combat aircraft. A special budget line will also be created for training in financial education. What are the talks with IMPR about? Haven't you left yet? The head of the department is looking for you. Yes, I understand. Thanks to co-authorship with the US government, a successful outcome is expected. You're lucky. What is heard in the West? They are a little upset. Initially, 120 vehicles were planned. Greed knows no bounds. Where else can you find such a country? Either way, this is the beginning. In Europe and Russia, too, has already begun to stir. Of course they will move. General Chon has already passed this stage, don't worry. You've been having a hard time lately. Let's drink to the success of our company. Have you explored Airstar parts? Let's drink to the success of our company. Have you explored Airstar parts? Enemy plane detected. 340 km to the north-east. Immediate mobilization. Enemy plane detected. Captain Pack. - Are you worried about something? - No, nothing like that. I'll try to sing. - Come on. - Okay. An enemy plane approaches the southern border of the East Sea. Report the situation. Falcon! Maintain a fighting position. Sit down for a while. Do you still go to the airfield covered in oil? How did you know about this? How could there be something that I would not know about the family. "Hey, Pak Deik." "Lieutenant Colonel Pak Daik." Can't get out of Yajan in any way? This is the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for the lives of 600,000 Korean soldiers. This is not Yajan. You need to be able to think broadly. I'll take note of that, chapter. I got this when I was promoted to first star. - Take it. - What? A man was born - Yes, all in business ... - Lieutenant Colonel Pak! Have you just finished? Look at your walk. Be equal, at attention! We are for the sake of the citizens of our country. Ready to give their lives. We live in the name of the order. Between carefree serenity and the painful truth, we choose the truth. At ease. The enemy plane retreated. There is no more danger. We return to the base. Mission accomplished. You can go back. We return to base. Falcon, get back in line. Malfunction detected. Loss of control. Falcon, get back in line. Falcon! Urgent news! Yesterday at 11 pm 50 km from Dokto Island, after a response maneuver of an enemy aircraft, the military plane of our Ministry of Defense fell . The crashed fighter was an F9 model. It was driven by Captain KanMo, who tried to get rid of the unexpected situation. At the moment, the pilot is in serious condition under the supervision of military doctors. Manager Pak, introduce yourself. This is the advisor to the President of the Air Force Council, Captain Zhu Yongwoon. And this is Seo Jung Moo, Issue 6422, from AirStar. And this ... Then let's get started. This case was recently reported. We all understand that now is the most crucial time. This time I will play for Manager Pak because he has no experience yet. Let's start with the black box. It is now being deciphered, but the damage is very severe. Therefore, it will be difficult to do this in the coming days . Continuous adversity - and suddenly good luck. In any case, you are a brawler with us, Hwang Chuim. What about the dispatcher's notes , Colonel Chu? Everything is saved in the analysis process. To protect public peace, keep everything in strict secrecy. Do you know? - Are you taking us for fools? - The next leader is Kwon. - What is our false scenario? - How about pilot error? There doesn't seem to be a likelihood that he will survive anyway . And we do not know whether the corps was taken away from the headwind, like last time. You can, of course, use the pilot's personal life. Let's do something heavier! In that case, I leave it to Chief Kwon to deal with this . "First, we took a look at Captain Kahn's story." "Problems with workout attendance and behavior were found ." Something like this. Not bad. Well, to embellish all this with something, then it will be very good. So. Our maintenance personnel, of course, have already done everything to ensure that nothing leaks. I'm sorry, what? Maintenance ... Not yet ... Do not ... Maintenance "for now"? Come here. Until? Until? For now? Until? For now? Stand up straight. Don't you understand the state of affairs yet? Send you to the tankers? - Do you want to sell sailor suits all your life in the military shop? - Not at all. Have you seen? You idiot think that everything is so easy and simple? AND? Listen carefully. If even one foot slips here, everyone will be dead. Colonel Joo, double- check all of the dispatcher's records. Chief Kwon, find out about the pilot. With family relationships to where, with whom he drank, where what panties he bought. Hwang Chu-Im, take care of the press. The main problem is time. If, like last time, there is a leak to other media, we are all corpses. We are first! Be sure to be the first! We must calculate everything! And now all for the cause. Hey Captain Park, what are you doing? It is now... what's happening? Do you not understand what is happening now? - The man suffered ... - Come to your senses, you idiot! What a moron ... If there is a problem in a fighter plane, do you know whose head will fly first? Yours! Don't know your position? Manager of the Aviation Parts Purchase Department . Pak Deik. Doesn't even know that his ass is being covered now ... Hey. The scenario that we have now come up with. Will go on your behalf, so calculate all the amendments immediately. Okay? This is the manager of our department, Park Daeck. And this is the head of the hospital, Jung Dae Yeon. - Meeting? - Secretary Nam ordered everyone to attend to their duties for now. But is it a little weird? How can you just hush it up? Then how to make it not strange? First you need to find the reason by examining the airplane body. - Then find the responsible ... - Find what? Substitute? The most important thing is to shift responsibility to someone else? Do not shift, but conduct a thorough investigation. Colonel Chon. How is that pilot? Well, first of all, he didn’t come to his senses. They say he is from the same city as our manager Pak. Why are you so surprised? Isn't that why you try so hard? He seems to worry too much about him. Take care of him. Of course I have to take care. What is it? When did you manage to take a pawn? This is the first time. Therefore, I understand that you are shocked. But let's learn from the situation. I had no extraneous thoughts. Did I say something? I believe you. You're a member of our family. After a thorough investigation, no malfunctions were found in the aircraft or equipment. Based on the recordings of conversations and the black box, it can be said that the pilot's health worsened during the maneuver, because of what he lost control. Because of this, the plane fell into the eastern sea. During the investigation, it was found that the pilot had been drinking the day before the crash. This probably led to a deterioration in his health. There is no chance that he will wake up. Then I will deal with the moment for the anonymous letter. SECRETARY We need to be careful with our expressions. What? I will improve. The first time it will be hard to deal with. Look after Park Daeik. Well done. To the bottom. Let me pour you. - I heard you are not easy now. - It's just my wife and my mother under the same roof. A real war. We must respect the work of the wives of the military. If war breaks out, then wives will go to war instead of husbands , so take care of them. Sonbennim, you worked hard too. Are they saying nothing from AirStar? Our younger ones figured it out a long time ago. Thank them for that. You're exaggerating. There are records of Captain Kahn's missteps. But no matter how ideal the system is, if you do not monitor the responsibility of each individual soldier, you never know what a crime it will result in. SECRETARY Nam, I'm really hurt. When necessary, you won't get a call from you. Manager, didn't you call? How did it not call? I called. You're just too busy to miss my call. Things went uphill and decided to stop being a member of our family? Enough already. I arrived right after filming. - Who is this? - You don't know each other? He has been with us for a long time. Spare parts procurement manager. Lieutenant Colonel Pak Daik. Is that what it is? Pleased to meet you. Here. I'm Jung Kwangwoo from the External Control Department. According to them, we really were a family. We were all bastards from the same womb. And yet, it seems to me that some important detail is missing. It is worth talking about "them". Having hid the matter in this way, the head of the department called me to that gadyushnik. I wanted to see where the cream of the military division gathers therefore I could not refuse. Has the fact that you were invited there become your weapon? With your blood. They recognized me as their real family. This friend suffered the most this time. Oh, really? Have a drink. Now you have become a real family director ... so keep on trying. Yes, I understand. There... I saw this man for the first time. What kind of person? Is it really him? I've heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you. We will see each other often henceforth, so we should make friends. What are you worth, Manager Pak? Airstar is a renowned American aviation parts company , they cannot even be compared with local producers. What is it? 75 cents? Not $ 75? Precisely cents. FCS81325? Not. Look again. Can't there be products of this company? - Not. - Strange ... Well this is the main spare part. Then call and ask in person. FCS 81325? I understood. Thanks for the help. FCS 81325. They say that it is out of production. But she came to us not so long ago ... It was discontinued 5 years ago. Even the production line is gone. If they catch us like this, they will immediately send us to the guardhouse. Good luck to you. 75 cents part - $ 315. $ 176 - $ 32,050. $ 525 - $ 100,800 Does this even make sense? I haven't found everything yet, I just accidentally chose 3 items from the entire list. We've got something here ... PX? Are we selling defense? You see, in arms ... the most important thing is that it works safely and smoothly. And then they think about the price. These are documents from production, here the cost of storage is not included in the price. And there is no delivery cost. Let's imagine that both storage and delivery costs are included. And yet, how can there be a 420 times difference? No, it turns out ... so we what ... money in your opinion? I'm not talking about that. Before that, there were tax overpayments, and firstly, you need to establish ... what the money was spent on. Install! What? What the fuck do you think we split the money between ourselves, or what? Who are they holding us for here at all? Head Hwang! Manager, the decision must be made today. You can come in. Don't like this job? If you don't like it, just tell me. I can send you back to Yajan at any time. Not at all. - I told you that we are a family. - Yes, that's right. And you... what did he do so outstanding to call - a family member as a thief? - That's not the point. I was just investigating as department manager. Don't you know what a delicate situation we are in now? - Yes, the head of the department. - Get the car ready. This is a question that concerns the honor and life of the pilots. That is why you are working so hard now ... working in the direction of new generation combat aircraft. - If another accident occurs at this time ... - Another accident? What is another accident? Because of the part FCS81325. All these parts were supplied to us by AirStar. Boss ... Please allow me to replace this part. I beg you. And if I don't, what will you do? Pak Deik. Why do not you answer? Lieutenant Colonel Pak Daik. Do you think this is our first time? Are you Lieutenant Colonel Park Daeck? September 28, 15:00, Mir coffee house. - Something happened? - I do not know. I have the honor. In places. Hello. Captain Cha! There are no bills today? Yes... It seems that for a while you will not have to deal with calculations. Hwan ChuIm! What did you just say? Management order. Somehow I don't want to eat with someone who calls his family thieves. Do you think I'm doing the wrong thing too, MiRan? If you do this again ... eat alone every day. Yes cold you! Oh, have you come? I could have changed before going to such a place. Sit down. It seems that I have come to the wrong place. You wanted to meet about Captain Kang Yong Woo. Come out. See you. Sit down. Well, let's start with your version of the story. No understatement. Let's do this. Let's start from the east side and hit the west. I have a reporter I know, try to meet him. There is no one to come at this time. Who's there? Hey Kim Jong Soo, open the door. Damn you! She asked me to be quieter, why break down the door. What? How do you talk to a Sonba at all? - I found a sunbae here. - No, but why are you so harmful? Well, was the interview successful? How is it? Yes, excellent. But there is no physical evidence. Where did the money come from and where did it go. How did the additional investigation go? Yes, the head is already splitting. I got into every account, but nothing at all. And by the head of the department too? Clean. Head of Overseas Operations, Domestic Procurement Officers, and of course Park Junhyun. So these are fake names? Exactly. It is not so easy to reveal the real ones. All uniform to the guardhouse? Is it that easy? The army is. We must find this way out by any means. Only there are no clues. In that case, obviously ... there must be something where the money goes. And this month did not come ... You said that you have some inconsistencies with your employees ... I'll try to figure it out. But in exchange... Could you not tell anyone about me? Can you make a promise? Yes, of course. Of course of course! Captain So. I'm not sure what to ask about this. But I was never credited money for expenses. Mine entered. This is what I'm thinking about. Maybe Chairman Kim has some problems? There have been so many accidents and misfortunes lately. Nothing like that. So is this an acquaintance of yours? My friend is sitting here, what accidents there are. Yes? Well, good. Hey. The doormat needs to be washed, you think you can clean it up with a smelly doormat? Yes? I will improve. What a moron. Washed everything up here fast! Or you will lick next time! - I have the honor. - Oh, yes. I have the honor. I have the honor. Sorry for the long wait, here's your passbook. Can you see a list of operations on it? Yes of course. Wait a minute. Sorry... There are a lot of cash receipts , can I make you an abbreviated statement? Well no. Print out everything that is. This was all due to the supply from Airstar. The head of the military department inside his structure is stirring up something illegal. - And you just throw this stuff away? - This is the primary case. - Yes, and there is no material evidence. - They can be found. I will ask one question. Do you think this soldier is doing this out of a sense of duty? Surely a lot of everything is mixed inside this case. The problem is staffing or a money issue. What are you doing? Get your hands out of your pockets and relax. Why is it so late ... Wow, what is this? Why are you so beautiful? Previously, you had to dress up like that. - How to dress up? - Well, you dressed up. - Pour a glass? - Do not. What? When did you have time to sing like that? While I was waiting for you, I tried to figure everything out. Park Jun Hee has done a lot of things. They could not even imagine that they would have a traitor inside. Moreover, not an ordinary employee, but an officer. That is ... I didn't mean it at all ... I believe that each organization should have its own prosecutor. Officer, you are just super. - Were using other names, right? - Yeah. Scoundrels. You said that the accounts were created in the name of a friend. But not all. I contacted my youngest from the prosecutor's office. Studied several accounts. There is such a Cha Woo Jin. Do you know who Cha Young Jin is? That is the name of his three-year-old son. This is somehow too much. Only now ... will everything be all right? What are you talking about? And, with those who are above us? Compared to me, they won't be as thrilled. When your boss finds out about this, you are a corpse. When will the official investigation begin? It is necessary to collect all the evidence and show it to the elders. Oh, yes, exactly. Here ... I printed it out here, be careful with that. Okay, great! As long as you have a search warrant, you can ask everyone left and right. These are war brutes. I would like to solve them all. Now you can entrust everything to me. I have already said, of course, but I ask you not to use material that reveals my personality. Yes, you said. Check out the latest revision. Don't underestimate television. If problems arise, we can solve them without your participation. I got it. Are you satisfied? So! Shouldn't we stop working? And while you are in a great mood, let's go have a drink somewhere! So you say you got promoted? Do you think I'm doing all this for personal gain? This is a normal question though. Those people you trust ... And they themselves are in some kind of special relationship with Park Jun Young. Moreover, these are your hube ... Suddenly, these showdowns began with AirStar ... Prove that you can be trusted. Chairman Kim ... committed suicide two weeks ago. Such a good day, what a talk. Let's talk about something interesting. Captain Park, do you like porn? - I love it. - Come on. Driver, take ... Captain Pack. How are you feeling? To be honest, I felt a strong sense of guilt. But slowly with the investigation of the case I realized that I started to forget that I am a military man. I want to stay in the military. I am only I want to become a military man again. Stop immediately! We are from the prosecutor's office. Starting at 14:20 current time We begin to search the Department of Defense 's procurement department. Start with computers. - Stop working. - On what basis? Captain Pack. Yes. I am the head of the war crimes team at the prosecutor's office, Kim Mensu. Well done. What are you looking for here? What? What are you speaking about? I know nothing. I'm doing it, to keep the vow that I made. At 9 am we will start broadcasting. Get ready. Yes understood. Hurrah. Well done. Director Hwang finally spoke up. - True? - The minister is now happier than me. They will also broadcast at 9. A script is being prepared now. Reporter Hong, are you ready? Yes, now I was talking about the final resolution. Permission? - When is the broadcast there? - At 9 PM. Do you have any idea what kind of porridge you made, son of a bitch? Sorry. I didn't think it would turn out like that. I will deal with this as soon as possible. - First the TV station ... - Enough. Go away. Let's have some coffee. This is from your home. Your wife has a lot of junk. For a fortune. - Did not know? - Where is Officer Jung? - Connect me to him. - What are you talking about? You are a criminal here. Do you think you twisted the officer around? You can't just receive. Hello Jung Soo, things have taken a strange turn. Are they broadcasting now? This is a common bribery case. But what's interesting about him is Captain Pak. This man reported ... How did it happen? What do you think he wanted? We searched the net for him ... To stop the process, it was necessary to submit it to human judgment. What are you doing? Don't you think this is too much? Hey. You've only been working for a few years, reporter, you don't understand anything. We must not lose face! The minister only pretends to be a victim. You know this is just a game. What are you babbling about? A trifle, but if you were wrong, do you think you can fix everything later? Sleep Head! Drive her out. Listen to me. Shut up. Apologize immediately. I haven't done anything to apologize for. Son of a bitch. Do you really not understand what is behind all this? Misunderstanding? Don't laugh. You will still pay. Does ShiVon go to elementary school? As long as you go free she will be 30. I just wanted to defend justice. Just a hotel ... - follow the code ... - Your oath is, of course, important. An officer who knows only the rules. Don't you understand the basics of army ethics? We all strive for one dream, obey one order. - The first thing that is required of you. - Absolute obedience. Then the soldiers ... do we just have to let them die? These are the victims. For the sake of world peace, sacrifice cannot be avoided. This is devotion. This is how the military spirit and sense of justice work. Hopeless asshole. Tried to hide behind a mosaic. Do you think we are not able to recognize you? An officer must have dignity. And you behave like a little girl ... I didn't know I was being filmed. So is this a false testimony? I give you one last chance. Think hard. Corruption in relation to AirStar ... I think ... The so-called man ... All over the earth ... no. The weakest, most vile traitor in the whole world ... The most useless creature ... Captain Pack. Dac. Listen to me. Wait! I was wrong. It was all a lie from the start. You just wanted a bright headline, so that the award for the best reporter goes out of the way and the number of views increases. Is not it so? Therefore... You decided to secretly film me. Sacrificing a little man to the public, isn't it? I wanted to tell you, but ... Would you agree to film? They didn't sue you, did they? Now they are afraid of your further actions. Now is the most crucial moment. Let's start again. Let's find another way. To give up now is to lose. You lose if you surrender! Fuck, what about Kang Young Woo? Kang Young Woo. Have you forgotten already? Never with me don't mention Kang Yongwoo's name anymore. Even if I fail, if I get hurt I will definitely avenge this army for him. Got it? Traitor Park Si Won, disappear. So, because of this? Only because of this your family, military service ... Has everything become unnecessary? Children mock ShiVon, they say that she is a traitor. The principal says he will kick ShiVon out of school. Do you know what she dreams of? Become a military man. For me... For me, family comes first. But for you, it seems not. I can not do it anymore. Why me and ShiVon have to suffer so much because of you? If jail time is too burdensome, how about sending it somewhere else? I will contact partners soon. Do you propose to suddenly transfer the officer like this? How then will the rest of us trust us? Then what do you suggest? Fix the brains and leave. No matter how hard he resists, the end will come. What if you can't fix anything? - In my opinion ... - He is my subordinate. Why would I discuss all this with you? Sorry. The chef is waiting for me. I will go. What do you think about this? You were also an officer? Will Park Dak stop? I'm a fool to ask someone who hates the army. How infuriating. Whoever betrayed you will regret it go where he belongs. Will die like a pig. He will not get off with an easy death. And you will leave ... God forgive me! Can't you be more careful? Heck. I have the honor. Let's go. You will have to use the same table with him. The use of telephones is prohibited by the rules. Who you are? I ask who are you? What happened? I can not do it anymore. Threatening calls are made several times a day. ShiVon's name, her school - they know everything. I can't live like this. I will take ShiVon and stay with my parents for a while. Hello. Who you are? I ask who is this? But... Do you know what's even more incredible? Replacement of composite parts. They pulled parts from ships stuck new labels on them and just sold like new. Can you confirm your words? Manager, you too have a family? And there are probably children. Me too. Wait then ... You can at least say where to find these ship parts? I ask you. Who are you? If you don't want to disappear forever, sit quietly. Do you understand? Urgent transfer order. Current place of work: Defense Aviation Administration Place of transfer: Ministry of Sports and Defense Forces Date: August 11, 1999. Didn't you say that we will go all the way? To end? What nonsense. You've already received a transfer order , right? Come on, it's over. I will go to Angola next week. They told me they were transferring me there. Yes, yes, I have the fucking honor. That's an order. Your minister, Changhoon. We're not fucking opponents to him. The Department of Defense, all these fucking generals, it's all in his hands. Therefore, I dare not say a word. Do you understand? What if I go on television as a victim? Will we be able to resist them then? Can you show your face on TV? Can you put everything on it? Let's say you go to television. And what do you have? Stolen data? Do you think people will stand up for you? Television is controlled by the same ministers, how can you count on it? For starters, Kang Young Woo ... I can start by telling you about Kang Yongwoo. I have his notes. And there is a victim who survived. And also ... family ... So you didn't get a message about him? A man from the Ministry of Defense gave it to us . Don't sign for anything. If I don't sign, then my father is not cremated in the military department. - There will be no question of any compensation and assistance then. - Wait a bit. I will try my best. If I listen to you, can you solve our money problems too? If I wait a little longer, who will decide everything that has accumulated in my father? But you can't just trust them either. How can I not believe them? My family... We are in so much pain, we are unbearably tired. My mother-in-law ... can you help her too? therefore enough. Sorry. I was asked many questions last night about the reason for the incident with pilot Im Jong Hwan. I think the reason was what he had drunk the day before that day. Though it's late ... we were able to decide on our further supplier. We will try to fix all the shortcomings so that such a tragedy does not happen again. - Yes. - This is Park Daeck. I'll provide a list from Airstar. Prepare ether. I will go out and personally confess everything. No caps needed. Uncover my identity. And blame me for everything. Mom. - Mother. - What? What happened? AND? Great, great blow! Good good. I watched TV yesterday and you came out great on the screen. And he spoke so straightforwardly. With such skills, you are only on the road to Congress. Well, it's still more your part. And I still have a lot of things to do in the army. And that's true. Are you still in charge of deliveries? There is so much to keep track of in this matter. Do not worry. Why talk about it on a day like this? But how can I? What's with Park Daeik? From today on he works in a new place. Hopeless. What? Minister. Park Dak didn't show up for work today. Minister! Pak DéIk ... on ... This son of a bitch! We must immediately arrest him as a deserter. Hey! Get all your contacts and recent call statements immediately . And that woman reporter. Find her. Understood. Psyna. Tomorrow night, 10 o'clock, PD25. Got it. I will personally contact Mr. Park. Recognition from a soldier. He reveals the hidden truth about the corruption in the army. PD25 will tell you everything today. Yes, I have already arrived. What's next? Do not worry. Just arrest him as soon as he shows up. I can live without the status of a "general's wife" But how can I refuse to be Park Daeik's wife? If so it happened, then try your best. Don't worry about me and ShiVon. Daddy. Do you know what mommy said? That daddy is just a very stupid military man. But at the same time the most daring in the whole world. Sergeant, Park Daeik is in the hotel opposite the TV station right now . In the hotel? Yes, Pak Deik. I am giving you one last chance. Confess everything that you have done. You cannot win this battle. You can still turn back. I don't care if I win or lose. I would rather die like a real soldier. Only cowards run away. Only those who surrendered in their officer rank. Hey Park Daeck, son of a bitch! Lives! - Where is Park Dak? - Sorry, we haven't found it yet. Here, look there. Attention. - I'm late? - Fine. We stand guard countries and nations. We do not have the right to choose our personal comfort, we can only follow the path of justice. I am giving you one last chance. Admit your sins, pray for forgiveness! This is your last chance, traitors! You were not even taught to listen to your elders. Are you doing well? Who do you think you are? Do you think you know everything? Okay. But what have you prepared? It's all? Run away and steal? I even put on a uniform, so I wanted to appear on TV. Are you even allowed to wear it, cattle? Ask yourself. Are you eligible to wear this uniform? What are you talking about? Chon's head. Remove the camera. Head Jung Hyun Soo, I have a couple of questions. What do you think about Park Dak's decision to release the list on our TV air? On the air? I said put the camera away. Leave it, ignore it. Park Dick stole it from my office. And are you going to broadcast with this? What does it mean? - What do you mean stole? “I didn't steal anything. Did you steal anything? Then what is it? You didn't steal it from my office, did you? Comrade reporter, listen carefully. Our squad developed a special plan to catch spies who divulge confidential information. This list has been created especially for those who want to become famous with his help on television. Do you understand? Why on earth is this a military secret? it - just your disgusting attitude to the service. - Not. Whatever you say, it's a military secret anyway. Do you understand, Pak Daik? Wait a second, something doesn't add up. Then why does Airstar also have these bogus documents? Do you think that the documents that Park Daeck has are yours? What is this nonsense? Give it to me. We have copies of Airstar. Filmed. Stripped off? We can assume that Airstar and you have identical documents? I did not steal these documents. But what if he continues to deny everything? We need to get Mayor Jung Hyun Soo to personally say that he has the same IDs as Airstar. Hello dear viewers. Today the program is reporting a huge incident in the army in the history of Korea. I... Head of the Department for the Procurement of Aviation Parts under the Ministry of Defense, Officer Pak Daik. Be in this place now very scary. Head of department, there ... Captain Kang Yongwoo died due to defective parts. The Defense Department report was false. And I, perfectly aware that this is a fake, could not do anything but sign. Pak Deik. You son of a bitch! Head of the department! Did you want to die? Head of department, cameras! Cameras! - Close the cameras. - I'll finish you off. Why are you frozen? Bastard, I'll kill you. Bitch! Even after death, he will remain an honorary soldier, and his family will continue to grieve. A few days ago the American company Airstar became the second in the list of the best business partners. And this particular company and there is the same supplier that is hiding behind the scenes of what happened. Even though it was late, I wanted to reveal the truth. I wanted to reveal those who cast a shadow on the credibility of our army. Like a soldier wearing this uniform on television ... making a nationwide recognition ... was it the right decision? I ask myself this question over and over again. But then I finally realized. I am an officer who must strictly obey the discipline of the army. But still, I am more of a person who must follow the laws. But those few officers ... who turned a blind eye to the national interests and security of the country ... hid the truth ... They undermined the reputation of the entire army. The uniform I put on came from the wrong officers. This uniform, which was given to me by the army and the citizens of our country. Soldier must die honorably on the battlefield. In 1997, an egregious case was uncovered of the purchase of aircraft parts by the Ministry of Defense at unacceptably high prices.
