(pigs snorting) - Kill the pigs, kill the pigs, kill the pigs, kill the pigs! Yeah, whoo! Whoo, yeah! Let's do it! Get those pigs! We're gonna kill 'em! Yeah! (laughs) Woo-hoo! Yeah! Hey, Annie, we're gonna kill your pigs. You hear that? - You stay away from my pigs! (gun fires) (upbeat music) (gun fires) (singing in foreign language) - Annie! Annie, stop shooting! Are you out of your mind? - You're late. - I know, I know, I am sorry, but you can't go around shooting children with a shotgun. - Oh, I load up with bacon rind or rock salt. Not gonna kill 'em, it's the smart a little. (chuckles) - They're children. - Oh, they're hooligans! Besides, there's nothing to do in this town except scare pigs and shoot children. Whoop-de-doo. Here, baby. - You could've hit the T-bird. - Georgio needs to walk. - (sighs) I'll walk him. - Go to Aunt Darnella. Yeah, sweetie. (chuckles) Can you do it? - Oh sweetheart. (indistinct) You're so beautiful, yes you are. Oh, yes you are, sweetheart. - The sweetest little thing. Yeah. (shushing) - Very good. - Yes. - Okay. - All right. I'll walk him, you go inside. - Yeah. Freezing. (shivers) - It's brisk. It's a beautiful, brisk, perfect Thanksgiving day. - Whoop-de-doo.

I'm having the baby there. Does that pretty much cover it? - No, not really. - Well, that's about all I've got, you know? - I was gonna ask if you like polka music. - Polka music? - Yeah. Frankie Yankovic, the Polka King. Myron Floren. You never heard of Myron Floren? - No. - Here. - What's this? - What do you mean, "What's this?" That's an 8-track.

At least he went out doing what he loved, eating and playing the slots. He was so full, full of life. - Well, you can't ask for anything better than that. - No! (laughing) Oh, darling, I'm so sorry for your loss as well. I know he was your friend, too. - Actually, he just gave me a ride. I was hitchhiking and- - Hitchhiking, in your condition? - Oh my god. - Um, yeah. I'm on my way to see my dad. I'm gonna get my stuff out of his truck and I'm gonna try to get another ride. But I really am sorry about your friend. He was a really nice guy, and uh, he liked polka music. - Yes, he did. - He did. He loved polka music. - Yeah. - It was nice meeting y'all. - Oh, honey, wait a minute. You can't expect to stand out here in this freezing cold weather eight months pregnant expecting to find a ride on Thanksgiving. - I just, I don't know what- - You can stay with me. You can spend the night, and then tomorrow, uh, tomorrow's another day. - You're welcome to stay with me, too, darling.

What is this place? - Well, Annie calls it a pig farm. But she never sells any of them. They just die of old age in a loving environment. It's actually more of a pig hospice, when you think about it. (Annie snoring) - I really am sorry about your friend Horace, the way he died. - Oh, I don't believe in death. I just think of it as taking off our spacesuits. - So, your Christmas lights are up early. - Oh, I leave them up all year long. The Christmas spirit is just so nice. It's a shame to save it for Christmas. So, now, you take the bed and I'll sleep on the convertible sofa. - No, I couldn't do that. - Well, of course you could, you're pregnant. You need your sleep. Your baby needs your sleep, or his sleep, or her sleep, or- - No, honestly, I couldn't. I'll be fine on the couch. - Oh, it's no trouble. - It's okay, I've got my monkey pillow. I'll be fine. (crickets chirping) - You okay over there? - Monkey pillow and red satin sheets. - (laughs) Can't beat that. Do you know what you're gonna have? - A bowling ball. - (laughs) I meant a boy or a girl. - Uh, whatever, you know. - What do you mean, "Whatever"? You're having a baby. You're bringing new life into the world. Aren't you excited? - I'm a runaway. I hitched a ride with a polka-loving truck driver who died of a heart attack. It's not like I've got this all planned out, you know? - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. You're being really nice. It's just, uh... It's just, uh. (laughs) It's so screwed up. Everything's so screwed up. I'm so screwed up. - You know, sometimes things don't turn out the way we planned. But then sometimes the very same things turn out to be blessings. - The truth is, I'm only having it because my parents don't want me to. - Well, (sighs) sometimes when people are under financial pressures and they have other mouths to feed- - Financial pressure? They're rich. I'm rich, we're rich. They could afford to feet 20 more mouths. I was an embarrassment. I go to boarding school, and everyone there would know. All of the girls, all of their parents. Everyone in their social circle. So, they said "Come home and have an abortion. We'll say it was appendicitis." And then I would go back and everything would be fine. Except the point is- - What? - It doesn't matter. It's stupid. I'm stupid, it doesn't matter. - You're not stupid. Don't say that. What doesn't matter? - I went away to boarding school when I was eight years old, and before that it was nannies and maids, and they were traveling, or... The point is, I didn't want everything to be okay, all right? I didn't want them to be able to say it was appendicitis, and everything would go back to the way it was. I didn't want everything to be back to the way it was. I hated the way it was. I wanted them to have to deal with it, to deal with me. - And what did they say? - They said that I was having an abortion, that was that. That they're not gonna be made fools of because their daughter is a tramp. So, I said "Fine, tell your friends I'm dead." And I ran. Could I have a glass of water, please? - Of course. (water running) How long have you been running? - Oh, three months. I call them, you know? I buy on of those pay as you go phones, and I ditch it so they can't trace it. I stay with friends. And now I'm going to my dad's, because he's cool. He gets it. He gets me. He'll get the kid, too. I wanna move in, and I'll have the kid and take care of it. Him, her, it. (chuckles) - The baby. - The baby. - Your baby. - My baby. - When I wasn't much older than you, I got pregnant. And at first all I thought about was, what was going on with me? But now you're the mom. And your baby is going to be depending on you making the right decisions. - Yeah, well I made the right decision. I'm going to my dad's. - Well, good. Now you can make another right decision. Go to sleep. (laughs) Do you have a nighty, or some pajamas? - I'll just sleep in my underwear. - You'll do no such thing. I'll give you one of my nightgowns. (humming) um, oops. Maybe not that one. Oh, I have just the thing! Annie made them for me. I've never worn them. - [Mary] Piggy jammies? - (laughs) They'll keep you snug as a bug. - [Mary] Thanks. - Goodnight, sweetheart. Sleep tight. - Thanks. - You're welcome. (soft music) (cheerful music) (laughs) - So, this is what you do every day? Walk the pig? - Well, Annie isn't as spry as she used to be, and uh, Georgio needs his exercise. And it's such a beautiful day. - But you're really not walking it, you're holding it. - Well, Georgio hurt his little pig foot and the vet said he should stay off of it for about a month. But he's a very social pig, and he loves to be out and about. Oh. There's Ms. Dorkus. She owns the trailer park. (playful orchestral music) Good morning, Ms. Dorkus. - What's so good about it? - Well, it's just a beautiful day, is all. - The economy is in a dump, you live in a dump, I own a dump. So, what have you got to be so cheery about all the time, anyway? - Well, I just think that life is wonderful. - It's crap. - Oh, you know that's not true. You're just saying that. This is my friend, Mary. - Pregnant runaway teenager. - Got it. - I rest my case. - Well, you just have a wonderful day, Mrs. Dorkus. - Well, your rent is due, Ms. Cheerful. (playful orchestral music) - Oh dear, I almost forgot. - What? - Horace, he was Jewish, and they have to be buried the next day. And I don't even think we have another Jew in this town. So here, why don't you finish walking Georgio, and I'll go look for a Jew in the Yellow Pages. - Nice pig. - Nice bike. - You live around here? - No, I'm going to L.A. My dad lives there. - Cool. - He's in a rock band. - Way cool. Is he like, famous? - Limping Lions. He had a big single in the '80s. "Apocalypse Momma"? - Oh yeah, that was like... No, I'm thinking of Guns N' Roses. - No, but they did a gig with them once. - They did? - They were like fourth in the bill, but they got to see them and everything. - Information? Yes, for Kaiyute, New Mexico. I'd like the number for anything Jewish. - How long have you lived here? - (sighs) I don't know. Since my mom lost her job. Couple of months, maybe. Why? - This place? I don't know, it's really odd. - (laughs) No duh. - I mean, I woke up this morning and I had piggy feet. I don't know. It's like, bizarro showgirl "Alice in Wonderland". - Mary, let's go, I found a Jew! - Speaking of "Alice in Wonderland", we found a Jew. Here, hold my pig. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) - I just found out that Lillian Littlefeather is really Jewish. I never even thought that because who would think that Littlefeather is really a Jewish name? But anyway, Horace wasn't very religious, but um, I wanted to honor his religion and have someone from his faith say a prayer. - Makes sense. - Yeah. Lillian knows 'em all. Not all the Jews, but all the prayers. - Can I ask you a question? - Of course. - Did you ever wanna be anything else? I mean, anything other than a showgirl? Not that there's anything wrong with that. - A flamenco dancer. I just have a feeling that we're missing something that Horace might want. - I think I know what it might be.

Give me a kiss. - It's glamorous, darling. - Nice to meet you. - Sweetheart, I'll see you later. Bye darling! - Bye, Lillian. - [Lillian] Whoo! For the same money they could've planted him a little closer. Oi, I've got this hip replacement, they don't understand I can't walk.

It was really nice meeting you. - No. - What do you mean? - Well, I mean, it's getting dark already and um, thank you for all the help you gave me with the funeral. I couldn't have, uh, pulled it together without you. Anyway, you could just spend the night, and um, you know, tomorrow's another day. - I don't wanna put you out again. - I won't hear another word about it. And you shouldn't be hitchhiking anyway. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. - Truth is, I'm scared. - About having the baby? - About all of it. Nothing's simple anymore. - Marshmallows are. - I think I'll take her shopping tomorrow. - I thought you were leaving tomorrow. Didn't she say she was leaving tomorrow? - I know. I know, but maybe I'll take her shopping. I thought maybe I'll buy her something tasteful. She doesn't have any maternity outfits, only those awful t-shirts. Something pretty. - You wanna go see a DVD? - Sure. - I got "Princess Bride", "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" - Okay. Oh, this is good. - I knew it. (laughs) - Knew what? - Well, you're doing it. - Doing what? What am I doing? - What you always do. (laughs) - I don't know what you're talking about. - Every time you meet a new man, you start spinning fairytales. He's Prince Charming, and he's the one who understands you. Or, or, you're reading one of those Vegas magazines of yours, they're opening a hotel and they're gonna do the old-style reviews again. - They are! It's just a matter of time. Glamor is going to make a comeback. - And you're playing the Kaiyute Casino. That's it, toots, that's the end of the line. After this you'll be a waitress in a greasy spoon pouring coffee for rednecks. - I am not gonna listen to this negativity. - I know you like a book. She's gonna go back to high school, and then she'll have the baby, and then she'll stay because she won't have any place to go, and then you'll be like a grandma, and we'll live happily ever after. Fairytales. - Maybe not. You don't know. - It's what you're thinking. I know what you're thinking. - What if I am? Family isn't just a question of, well, family. Sometimes we choose our family, sometimes we make our own families. - And what happens to me? Huh? What happens to me? - Oh, Annie. Is that what this is all about? I love you. You're my family. And nothing is gonna change that. Still, it might be nice, a little bit bigger family, hmm? - You had a daughter. You gave her up. You can't get her back with some stray. - I'm not gonna listen to this anymore. - You think only a man can break your heart, Darnella? - Shopping? - Yeah. - For what? - I don't know, something young and pretty and tasteful. You know, not just t-shirts. - Thanks, but you've done enough already for me. - No, it's no bother. It would be fun. - Yeah, but I need go to go L.A., to see my dad. - Oh yeah, but you can go to L.A. in something pretty. - Darnella, you're being really nice, but I think he'll probably wanna buy me stuff. - Oh, yeah. - I mean, I'm his daughter and it's gonna be his grandkid, so. Excuse me. - No. No, you're, you're right. You're (sighs), you're absolutely right. Yeah. Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Does your father know you're coming? - Well, what do you mean? - I mean, have you talked to him? Is he expecting you? - Well sure, what are you talking about? Of course he knows I'm coming. - Why didn't he send you an airplane ticket, or a bus ticket? I, I'm sorry, I had no right to ask you that question. No, it's none of my business and I apologize. - What do you think? He doesn't wanna see me? - No, no, I never said that. - My father loves me, okay? - Well, I, I'm sure he does, it's just that- - What? - (sighs) Well, it's just that, you know, you're welcome to stay here. You know, it's no bother, and if things don't work out- - My father loves me, and he's not some uptight jerk like my mother. He's not gonna get all worried that I'm gonna embarrass him or make him feel like a fool, 'cause he's cool. He's in a band. He knows Axl Rose, okay? - I apologize. - And I really appreciate you taking me in for the night and all, but that's it. I mean, you're really nice, but it's kinda weird here. I'm a little weirded out. And I gotta be honest, you and your friends, I mean, there's a huge weirdness factor here, you know? - You think I'm... You think my friends... You think we're weird? - Well, you know, pig lady, kinda creepy, you know? - She's a lonely old lady, Mary, and all she has in life are some aging pigs, and me. - I'm sorry, I'm just- - No. I apologize. I'll take you down to the bus station tomorrow. - It's okay, I can hitch. Can't afford a bus ticket. - Sure you can. The last thing Horace did was hit the jackpot. He would want you to have it. It's uh, almost $200 in very cold quarters. - I can't take this. - Sure you can. He told you he'd get you to L.A., and I never knew him to break his word. - Listen, I really appreciate you letting me stay here these last couple of days. - I've had the happiest time getting to know you. - And I didn't mean what I said, about you and your friends being weird. - Maybe we're not weird, but, colorful. - (laughs) Colorful. I will never forget you. (laughs) (soft music) - Yeah? (rock music) - Dad? - Oh! My god. Mary. You look so much older than in your last picture, and uh, so much more preggers. - Mom didn't tell you? - No, no. Dude, dude, dude, you're preggers. - Dude. Can I like, come in? - Oh yeah, sure, kid. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you stand outside. Yeah, you know (speaks Spanish), come on in. Dude. I'm a grandfather. Man, I mean, this can't get into Rolling Stone. - Dad, don't worry. You guys aren't that famous anymore. - Ouch. Slings and arrows, ooh. - Please tell me you just got back from somewhere. - Oh, no, dude, I'm just getting ready to go. We got a three-month tour. We got New Zealand, Australia, some weird gig in Singapore, and we end up playing for some sheik in Abu Dhabi who's like a total freak for "Apocalypse Momma". I mean, like, I thought you were the limo driver. - Abu Dhabi, cool. - So, uh... So like, what are you doing here, Mersy? - What am I doing here? I'm pregnant. - So? You should be, like, with your mom, right? And Phil. - They wanted me to have an abortion. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh? Well, I wasn't gonna get one, so I wanted to come here 'cause I thought you would understand. And, I mean. - Mersy, you didn't even call and tell me you were coming. - I'm your daughter. - I know that, and that's why I had this who summer mapped out, you know, with moms for the school year and me for the summer. I'm down with that. But I mean, dude, you just show up- - Stop saying dude. You're an adult. You're almost 50. You're my father. (intercom buzzing) - Yeah? - [Driver] Mr. Prentis, I'm your driver. - Yeah, I'll be right with you. Just chill. - Mersy, I don't know what you want me- - Don't call me Mersy. I'm not a little girl. I'm about to be a mother. - I don't know what you want me to say, Mary. I've got to leave on tour. That's where the child support payments come from, me, touring. That's where the money for your private school comes from. That's where all of it comes from. - I'm talking about supporting me, not support with payments, not tuition for a fancy school- - Look, man, Mersy... Mary, I'm sorry. You need a place to crash, you're welcome to stay here. The place is yours. And you know what? I'm gonna text you the name of a doctor and I'll pay all the, you know, the doctor bills and stuff. But I've gotta be on this tour. I mean, (chuckles) look at me, I'm an over the hill rocker who's had one gig in life. I blow this and I got nothing. I mean, you didn't even call to tell me you were coming, man. - This is when I need you the most, Dad. - Hey, you know what? You want it that way, you wanna try and lay a guilt trip on me, it's not happening. If this is where you needed me the most, you should've picked up the phone and called me and let me know what was going on. - Yeah? And what would you have said? - Hey, well, I don't know, okay? Like we'll never know 'cause it never happened. - Sure we do. You would've said, "I gotta go on tour." (sighs heavily) - Here's the key. The place is yours. Mary, I love you. It's all I've got, kid. It's all I've got. (soft music) (phone ringing) - [Meg] Hello, this is Meg. If you'd like to leave a message for me, press one. If you're calling for Phil, press two. Mary's away at school, unless you're calling at the holidays, in which case press three, and one of us will get back to you as soon as we can. - Hi, Mom, it's me. I'm okay. I'm at Dad's. You were right about him. I should've listened. Maybe it's time for me to come home. I don't know. I Don't have anywhere else to go. (laughing) - Oh. Oh. (crying) - Can I stay here? I mean, you said I could. - Of course you can stay here. Of course you can stay here. And tomorrow we'll take you to the obstetrician and we'll buy you some maternity clothes, we'll get a crib. Well, a very small crib. I don't know, we'll figure out something. But (laughs) but yes, of course. Of course you can stay here, it'll be perfect. (singing in foreign language) (banging) You're invited to dinner. - When? - Now. Mary's back. - Geez. Merry Christmas. - No, not one word out of you. You're gonna come to dinner and you're gonna be nice. And do you know why? - Why? - Because you're going to be a great grandmother, and nobody likes a great grandmother who is a sourpuss. - What are you talking about? - Mary is moving in with me. She's going to have the baby here. Remember what I said to you about people who are alone who choose a family? Well, this family just got a little bit bigger, and you can choose to be in it, or not. - I don't like to be bossed around. - Tough! You know how to knit? I need booties, and a bonnet. - Little booties? Little piggy booties? - What a wonderful idea. I never thought of that. - Has she told her parents? - Uh, yeah, I think that's how this whole thing started. - That she's staying with you and she's gonna have the baby here? - No. No, you're right. Uh, they would be worried to death about her. I'll make sure she calls them right away. (answering machine beeping) - [Darnella] Leave a message, don't just hang up. - [Mary] Okay. Hi, Mom, it's me. I'm okay, I'm with people who care about me. I'm seeing a doctor. I'm going to have a baby with people that care about me, in safe surroundings. Uh, I'll call you after the baby's born. Okay, bye. (answering machine beeps) - First she runs off to her father's, god knows why, then in the form of a message she said she was coming home. Why did she change her mind? Do you think she's been drugged? - Well, you can definitely hear someone. Someone who's more mature telling her to leave a message at the beginning. - Do you think she's been kidnapped? - Well, have you gotten any ransom demands? - No. - Not yet. Maybe they're waiting for the baby to be born. Maybe that way, they think they can charge more. Our daughter, our grandchild. God only knows how much they'll demand. - Especially if they find out we have money. - Oh darling, all they have to do is look at her teeth and they'll know we have money. - Do you really think she's been kidnapped? - Well, (sighs) it's certainly a possibility. But you've got the number tracked in the caller ID and I got some connects down at the police department so we can track it. Now, if she used a cell phone it'll be a little bit more difficult, but it ain't impossible. - The reason we hired you and your associates, Tony, is that we don't want to go to the police with this. We certainly don't want the publicity. - No one knows she's pregnant. We've told the school she's taking a break, studying art in Florence. Something like this could ruin a young girl, her reputation, her standing. And it'd be awful for us. - Darling, if she hasn't been kidnapped, she's just run away, then. - Well, then we know she's safe, and we know she's pregnant. She can't go traipsing around. So I can reason with her, discreetly. - Ah, I think that's the key word here, Tony. Discretion, yes? - Hey, our agency is nothing if not discreet, all right? And look, I'ma do my thing. If you get any more messages, call me immediately. Don't trip. Oh, I'ma get your daughter back, and your grandchild. - Grandchild. Big concept. - Yes.

Besides, I left Grandma Betty's mirror and the picture of Frank in the T-bird. - Lamaze is a breathing technique that helps a woman focus on her body rather than on the pain of contractions during childbirth. Yes? - What if I want drugs? - Oh, I want drugs. - No. - Well, that's what this class is, to help you do without, so that you can have a natural childbirth. - Right, but what if I want natural drugs? (laughing) - Well, we'll discuss several alternatives in a while, but these techniques really, really are very effective. - Until you need the drugs, right? - We're gonna get to the drug part, okay? (laughing) - Thank you. - But first, I want you to establish what we call your breathing baseline. (Mary gasps) - Oh, I felt him kick. It is so sweet.

I mean, we're kinda new to this, too, and we're just getting all the baby stuff together, you know? - [Barbara] Yeah, okay. Great.

But we just don't have the room. - Not yet, but we will have, possibly in a few months, you know? Maybe, yeah. - You guys are all hooked up. I mean, you like, thought of everything. - Well, we've been trying to get pregnant for eight years, so I guess we had the time to think about it. (slow music) - I just don't know if I'm gonna be any good at it. I don't know if you're gonna be any good at it. I just. - Oh. Oh, you're gonna be a wonderful mother, I know you are. And you know, uh, after the baby is a little bit older, and whenever you think about it, um, you should go back to school. And I'll look after the baby, and Annie will help, and... We're the village. Or, the trailer park. But um, we're like a village. Oh. What? What? - I just remember when I was a little kid and I would get to come home from boarding school for the holidays, and there would be a tree. It was the only time I felt like I had a family. And everyone was really happy. It's just different now. It's really different. I'm sorry. You're like, the nicest person I've ever met, and I'm being really ungrateful. - You're right. - I know. I'm being a baby. - No, no. You're not. I meant, you're right about Christmas. You are. And I never realized it until just now. (sighs) I am so tired of having frozen turkey TV dinners for the holidays. It sucks. - No, that frozen thing we had on Thanksgiving, the first night, it was nice. - Sucks! Sucks big time. Sucks eggs! We are gonna have a real Christmas. A real, real Christmas. (singing in foreign language) - Yes? - Hi. - Okay, hi. What's wrong? What's broke? What's your complaint? - I don't have any complaints. Everything's just wonderful. - Then what are you doing here if everything's so hunky-dory? - I was just thinking- - Don't strain yourself. - I was thinking... What is that wonderful smell? I mean, something smells delicious. - Of course something smells delicious. I've been cooking, and I'm a good cook, and that's the way my food is supposed to smell. - But I mean that smells phenomenal. - That's my lots of meat lasagna. You can have a taste, if you like. - I don't wanna put you out. - You're not putting me out. I said you could have a taste. - Oh my gosh. - Good, huh? - Oh my gosh, that's the- - The best. - The best lasagna I have ever had in my whole life. - You think that's good, wait till you taste this. Fired asparagus with creole mustard sauce. It doesn't go with lasagna, but I said what the heck. Open, taste. - Mm. Mm. Oh my gosh. - You've got to come up with another list of expletives. It's getting boring. But it is nice to have somebody that appreciates good food. - We're gonna have a party. - Oh, no, no, no, no parties allowed in this trailer park. - We're gonna have the best Christmas party ever. Lillian's gonna close the restaurant at the casino on Christmas Eve, that's where we've gonna have it, and everybody's gonna make something. But there's gonna be a room full of people who are going to appreciate the best food they have ever had in their life because no matter what they eat, it's gonna pale in comparison to what you can do. - I am not going to bust my hump making Christmas dinner for a bunch of strangers. - They're not strangers, they're friends. - I haven't got any... I haven't got time to do a lot of cooking for some freeloaders. - Well, you're right. Lasagna doesn't go with Christmas, and if that's all you know how to make, that and- - If that's all I know how to make? If that's all I know how to make? You're just saying that because you have never had my slow-cooked black-eyed peas with ham bites, and my corn fried in butter, and my cornbread that tastes like cake. Oh my goodness, what am I talking about? Nuh-uh, it's too much trouble. - We can help. - Who is we? - My girlfriends, me. It'd be fun. Mrs. Dorkus, when was the last time that you had fun? - I have fun when I cook. - Well, I'm not saying that you'd want to, but if you would want to cook some food for the party, what would you cook that would be fun? - Well, I could make a hickory smoked turkey with chestnuts and cranberry stuffing. Some ham bites, and some candied yams and pineapples covered all over with marshmallows. - Oh. - (chuckles) Honey, I'm gonna knock their socks off. This is gonna be fun. - I'm coming. Wait a second. (laughs) Darnella. The girls told me I'd find you here. (sighs) - Hi, Lillian. - Hi, darling. - (sighs) You know, I didn't know Horace that well, but I like to come and visit him. Isn't life strange and wonderful at the same time? Because of Horace, I'm about to have a whole new family. - You know, Darnella, you're a real mensch, you know that? - Well, you're the mensch for giving us the- - Nah. - The casino. - No. - Yeah. - Business is so lousy, the restaurant might as well be closed. And I'm not saying just Christmas Eve. - What do you mean? - Well, listen. This is between you, me, and the lamppost, you understand? - The lamppost? - It's an expression. Just ignore the lamppost part. Okay, listen. I'm giving you a heads up. - What? - We're in trouble. I mean, the casino, you know the economy. And uh, I mean, everybody gets a bailout but the Kaiyutes, and I'm the last of the Kaiyutes. - Lillian, what are you talking about? - (stammering) We're gonna go out of business. - Oh my god. Are you sure? - If we don't turn around this business in three months, the doors to the Kaiyute Casino will be closed forever. And Northern New Mexico can say goodbye to fine dining and glamor. - Jerry Zee. - What about him? - He's your agent, right? - Well, he used to be. He hasn't gotten me a gig in years. - Well, who else has he got? He's still your agent. - It's his problem, chica. Let him think of something. - What else is an agent for? (buzzing) (phone ringing) - Ah. Jerry Zee. Who? Darnella, sweetheart! How are ya, baby? How's the gig with the Indians? Oh, I love it. Me? Same old same old. What can I tell ya? Vegas. Uh, sure I got time. What can I do for you, bubby? What? You're having a baby? This is fantastic! I didn't think you knew about the birds and the bees. (laughs) Seriously, this is not only fantastic, this is miraculous. If you're having a baby, sweetheart, I can get Ripley's Believe It Or Not. I can get Unsolved Mysteries. They're off the air? What do I know? I still use a coat hanger for my rabbit ears. Robert Stag died? Oh! I always thought he looked a little stiff, but I never would've given him a dead. No, no. Um, but seriously, we can make a career out of this. Oh, it's not you, it's a kid having a kid. Oh, too bad, I wanted to see video. (laughs) There goes my fantasy. Okay, but seriously, uh, there's not much I can do with that, it happens all the time, nothing special. I'm not understanding. You're going back to college? The kid is gonna go back to college? The baby is gonna go to college? I'm sorry, I don't get it, there's no act there. Oh, okay. Uh, I get it. Yes, I see, I see, I see. No, yeah. I see, I get it. You need money to eventually send the baby to college. (buzzing) Let me think, concept. I think I got it. No, not that. A fly that's been driving me nuts here. Where was I? Are you still friendly with those cuties? What's her name? Burgundy? Uh, Bud Lite? Shar D'Anay, exactly. All right, what we do is a showgirls Christmas gift calendar. Wait a second, hear me out. You, the girls. No, listen. Cheeky Blaine and his whole blazing Elvis getup. We sell it to all your fans at the casino. No, because why? The English ladies, they made a calendar, they made up, thousands, millions, am I right? A Christmas gift showgirls calendar. Boom, the perfect gift for daddy. Bingo, huh? It's a winner. I will tell you what. I will drive up tomorrow and personally produce the photo shoot. Yeah. Uh, Cher and Elton are just gonna have to handle their own affairs for two days. I'll tell ya, sweetheart, day and night, they never let up with me. It's Cher this and Elton who? I love to say, Cher? Cher who? (laughs) Seriously, enough already. Ciao, baby, put on your warpaint, I'm on my way. Darnella. Darnella. (laughs) Go ahead, live a little longer, I'm in a good mood. (buzzing) All right, Darnella, you're a livin' Christmas tree. Smile! Get that, sweetheart. Oh yes, you're the biggest surprise Santa can bring down the chimney. It's a family holiday, but something for Dad, do you know what I mean? - Showgirl Christmas calendar? - Yes, please. - There you go. Thank you. - (laughs) You flirt! You devil. You're gonna have all the girls' hearts fluttering. Okay, go hunt some Easter eggs. (laughs) - Here, get your Showgirl Christmas calendar. - Where are the Christmas pigs? I don't get it. - The Showgirls Christmas Gift Calendar. Hmm. - Meg, darling, be reasonable, would you? It's Christmas Eve, it's the second busiest travel day of the year. - So what, Phil? You hired a private detective. He found this picture on the internet. Now we know where she is. No, Consuelo. Consuela? It's my daughter, Phil. It's my daughter. - Darling, I know it's your daughter. - Well, you'd feel differently if it was your daughter. - I'd feel exactly the same, Megan. Look, we're trying to get tickets at the last minute on Christmas Eve to the nearest airport to Kaiyute, New Mexico, which happens to be in Mulechute, Oklahoma. It's not exactly easy. - No, no, mucho darker. I'm sorry, you were saying? - I was saying, it's not as if the airlines have staged a bidding war to see who puts their hub in Mulechute, Oklahoma. I mean, it's not as if Mary's life is in any danger. - And how do you know that? - Because it isn't. - She's been kidnapped by showgirls. - [Phil] Darling, she hasn't been kidnapped. She's smiling in the picture. - Oh, but Phil, they always make them smile when they kidnap them, just like Al-Qaeda. - They started a college fund for her, Megan. - And that is the most demeaning thing of all. Can you imagine what our friends would say? That we pimped our daughter out to a cult of showgirls, and can't even pay for our own grandchild's education? Next thing you know they'll be saying we're on food stamps. - Megan, if we go we won't even be able to bring her back on a plane. She's nine months pregnant. No airline would allow it. - At least we can get her out of the clutches of those gypsies. It's bad enough that my daughter is being held by a band of bimbos, but this is now on the internet. - Darling, really, I think you're making too much of this. - Do you understand what this means? - [Phil] Megan- - Everybody in the world is going to be seeing it. The next thing you know, it's gonna be you and me. It's, it's terrible, it's awful, I can't believe it. - Megan, come to your senses. - Make the reservations, Phil, or I'll charter a jet! - [Man On Radio] Trans Prairie Airways, you are clear to land. Did you encounter any turbulence on the way down? - Oh yeah.

Wave bye. Now, Mary. The hospital's filled to capacity tonight, so I'm gonna ask you if you could share a room with another young woman who went into labor this evening. - Why does she have to share a room? - That's fine, I don't mind. - Well, it's not really your daughter I'm concerned about. This young woman's baby was stillborn. Now, normally we'd put her in a private room, but we won't be able to move her until tomorrow morning. So, I'm gonna ask you, please nurse your baby in the hallway out of deference. - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Well, maybe they'll be able to have more children. - No. They won't. Unfortunately, she won't be able to have any more children. - Monkey pillow. (chuckles) You okay? - Mm-hmm. - All right. - I love you, too. - Oh my gosh. - We just heard. We are so sorry for your loss. - It's just, you know, we waited so long, and, he never even took a breath. (sobbing) How's your baby? - She's fine. - I'm glad. I'm really glad. I'm really happy for you, it's just. I can't do it. (sobbing) - Excuse us. - Of course. (slow music) (muffled speaking over intercom) - Oh. (laughs) - I thought I would find you when I didn't see you in your room. Are you sure you're supposed to be walking around? - Yeah, 16. Resilient. This is so amazing. - It is that. Just amazing. - I mean, about how everything turned out, you know? My mother here, with Phil. They're being really nice. I mean, you talk about miracles. And the way you took me in. And everything. I don't think I've ever had so many people who were like family. It's what I wanted most in life. A big family, everyone's laughing, holidays. It couldn't have turned out better if it was planned. - Maybe it was. - What do you mean? - Well, just that. I think there is a plan, even though sometimes we don't see it, even though we're too close to it to make it out clearly. I still think there's a plan. - Wasn't much of a plan for Barbara and Joe. - I don't know. - What are you talking about? They waited all that time for a baby. They're like the perfect couple, they have everything ready. And they'll go home to an empty house. Here I am. I've never even thought about having a kid. Not much of a plan, if you ask me. - Let's sit down. Remember when I told you that when I was just a little bit older than you, almost 18, that I had a baby of my own? A little girl. A perfect, beautiful, magical little girl. - What happened? Did she, uh, did she get sick or something? - No, thank goodness. But I realized that I was 17, single, and a showgirl. Truth was that I was... I had a baby, but I wasn't ready to be a mother. Not the kind of mother that she deserved. And then I remembered what my grandma said. - What? - She said that when you love someone, you love them with an open hand, not clutching, not like a fist, but open, because the greatest act of love that anyone can do is to let go. I always wondered how my daughter turned out. She went to a good home, to a loving couple who weren't able to have children of their own. But they were far more ready than I was to be a parent. I know how I would've liked her to turn out, Mary. I would've liked her to be exactly like you. - I wanna give the baby up for adoption. I wanna give her up to the couple whose baby was stillborn. They're wonderful people, who'll make wonderful parents. It's not my choice alone, 'cause she's your grandchild and you have to deal with this, too. My baby deserves someone that's not just ready to be a parent, but knows how to be a parent, knows how to be a mother. And I'm not 'cause I never learned it from you, Mom. - Mary- - Please let me finish. I never learned from you what a mother was supposed to be like. And I want that. I want that very much. So, when I do have kids I can take care of them. I'll know what a mother looks like, and what she feels like, and you're the only person in the world that can give that to me. And I'm the only person in the world that can show you what it feels like when a daughter loves you. I wanna go home. But not to some boarding school. And I wanna be your loving daughter, and I'm not. And I want you to be more than someone who gave birth to me. And right now, you're not. And that's awful. And I don't want it to be like that anymore. - Mary, maybe you should run away from home more often. It's good for you.
