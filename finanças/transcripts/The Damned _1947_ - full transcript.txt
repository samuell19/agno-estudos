The Damned April 18 1945 In liberated Royan, the evacuated inhabitants return home. My harmonica. Oh! I was happy to find it again. It reminded me of so many things. Things from before. My youth. Going camping. Helen. Peacetime. My life was finally going to revert to its normal course. Its normal course? Idiot! How could I guess that at the same moment, how could I know my destiny was decided somewhere in Europe... In Oslo! But what did the people of Oslo have to do with me? There you were, motionless, You played the harmonica, and at that moment... Go on! Play, old boy! Play! But why Oslo? April 19 1945, several days before the fall of Berlin. Your papers, please. Very good. General von Hauser, One of the most important man in Wehrmacht. Forster, a collaborator of Himmler, and Willy Morus, a Berlin hood. Germany crumbled, and these important figures of the Third Reich appeared aboard a German submarine. General Von Hauser! Commandant von der Rancke. Allow me to show you to your cabin. Thank you. General von Houser. Group Chief S.S. Forster. You must remember me. Forster? This is my right arm, Willy Morus. Now I remember! If you would be so kind... Whose baggage is this? Madame Garosi's. Very good. Their papers are good, but their identities are false. They preferred to change their names. Let's go. Engines at full steam, slowly! - 5 degrees port side! - Very good! If you'd follow me, Madame. Hilda Garosi, 30 years old, born in Sudetenland, Italian by marriage, militant Nazi, and General von Hauser's mistress. Your cabin, Madame. I don't speak Italian. Madame and me, together. Ah, Erich! I can't travel under these conditions. Hilda in one cabin, me in another. It's ridiculous. There must have been a misunderstanding. Speak with the Captain. Oh, it's impossible! I cannot take advantage of my rank to involve myself in personal matters. Follow me, please. Yes. Garosi didn't speak German. His wife didn't speak Italian. French was adopted as a language of diplomacy. Couturier. We met at the Embassy in Paris in November 1942. Karen Bach introduced us. We dined at Maxim's, the night of Toulon. A fabulous dinner! You were, it seems to me, next to Consul General Kiring, a great friend of mine. On my right was Captain Schulz of the Propagandastaffe! Yes...perhaps. Yes, in fact. I'll see you later. A very important man, Garosi. His father supported Mussolini in 1920. And he has, in all the factories in Northern Italy, considerable interests. Considerable! I interviewed him for my paper, The Real France. Have you heard of it? I published it in November 1940. Yes. 1940... That took some courage back then, to risk yourself in such an adventure. It started off well, my newspaper. A pity. Oh well! Whoever lives will know. We're Scandinavian. I was raised in France, but my father doesn't speak French. Scandinavians, French, Italians, Germans... Like Noah's Ark! All that's missing is the flood. In several days, we will arrive in South America. You must create, will the help of our agents and partisans, networks of influence, reception centers, offices of information, houses of refuge, where very soon can meet again, all our leaders, in order to prepare for or confirm our victory. All our leaders, political and military. All those who, like you, have made to their ideals the sacrifice of their personal lives. One shouldn't go so far. Mr. Couturier, your specialty is propaganda. Over there you have interests in several newspapers and are known in some interesting circles. Each of us has his specialty. My husband is always in contact with his compatriots abroad. Mr. Ericksen, as a scholar, whose research might bring us perhaps the final victory. Victory doesn't necessarily belong to those who win the war. Victory is never final. It isn't achieved except through persistent action during peacetime. God hears us, and our Fuhrer watches over us. I would like to speak with you. I'm not disturbing you? No. We're never alone. I wish we hadn't made this trip. It gives me a bad feeling. How about you? - What do you mean? - I've thought about it a lot. Such a long voyage in a submarine... I sleep at night. I don't tremble. Go to bed. Good night. His wife's neurosis tormented Garosi. He knew all about her relationship with von Hauser. He knew why he'd been refused a cabin for two. But he was weak and besotted. Prepare to descend! Everybody on your feet! Prepare for the descent! They passed by the Pas-de-Calais, then by the English Channel, the most dangerous zone of all. Three English fighters were in sight. Down we go! Prepare to descend! 108 degrees port side! Below zero! Past 50 meters! - Pass 200 meters! - Past 200 meters! Turn completely to starboard! Completely to starboard! ...220... ...230... ...240... Continue. ...250... A little bit more. ...260... Try to stabilize. We're almost there. Stop the engines! Stop the engines! Engines are stopped! ...270... ...280... 290 meters! 300! 305! 310! 330 meters! Hilda! - What? - There's a water leak. Ah! Hilda! Hilda! What have you done? No temperature. She's been in a coma since yesterday. Captain, there must be a remedy. It's beyond my powers. It's incredible! Ordinarily, there's always a doctor onboard. It's a criminal lack of foresight. We thought of everything, except the essential. Here they repair engines, not people. We'll get a doctor at Royan. Very well. Head for Royan. You see? It's all arranged. Hilda, my love. It's all my fault. You understand me. Still nothing on the radio? No, nothing. It isn't normal. Maybe there's been a bombardment or a change in code. No...It's impossible! What's that mean? Quick, the radio! Radio! Radio! We're calling on the radio. We must make other arrangements. - But what for? - To land. There's no longer any question. Have you changed your mind? It's your troops that have changed their position. You pretend to want to ensure the safety of everyone. A pretext. I counted on using the stopover to remove Mrs. Garosi. Are you crazy? General, sometimes you have to rid yourself of ballast. Mrs. Garosi is dead weight. Pleasure comes after duty. I am entirely of your opinion, Mr. Forster. Could you get me your aide-de-camp? - Willy? - Willy. I would like to verify his orders on this mission. I find that he has a head of dead weight, your Willy Morus. As you wish, General. You recall my powers a little late. I have the official authority. In future, don't forget it. Ah! Mr. Couturier. Tonight you will accompany the first mate and Mr. Willy Morus. I count on you to bring us a good doctor. But I don't know the area. I wouldn't be of any use to you. Don't be silly. Willy Morus has lived in France. And if things got dire, he could demonstrate what a good shot he is. I chose the second mate because he's organized a minefield, so he knows the area. I've chosen you because you're French. A frenchman among the French. Be careful. Our troops have had to retreat somewhat. The region is occupied by your compatriots. The evacuation of a German position is vital information. - Isn't it? - Yes, sir. - You wouldn't have told us? - No. You're Austrian, aren't you? You must obey my orders! No doubt you're a Social Democrat? From now on, I will be the first to see any messages! I don't understand why I've been chosen. But...that means nothing to you, does it? - My accent gives me away. - Your accent isn't so bad! - But if I were in your place... - Hmm? What? You have an opportunity to escape a crossing that worries you. Yes, of course. You, we'll let you off at Genoa or Naples, and you will no doubt be overjoyed to rejoin your countrymen. Willy Morus had learned French in Paris. Which only made him more dangerous. - You've arrived just in time. - Are you the doctor? Alas, yes. What's the trouble? - Is he the one who's sick? - It's his throat. It's all red. He can't swallow anything. Has he had a sore throat for a long time? It's been two days. I would have come sooner, but we've had no doctor for six months. I would have found another doctor, but there isn't one. On top of that, the wells are all poisoned. Who can you trust? Hold that. You're not afraid I'll gobble you up, are you? Look at that. Come on, open your mouth. There... There. Perhaps you have something as well? Come on, show me quickly. Could you tell me where I could find a doctor? I had an auto accident. My wife is injured. Don't wear yourself out, don't come when I'm busy, and take a couple of drops of witch hazel before every meal. Don't worry. I'll see you at the end of the month. Get going now. You've seen enough of me. Hello, Doctor. I'm sorry to bother you so late, but I had a car accident. I punctured a tire, braked suddenly, and my wife hit the windshield. She lost consciousness. I can't bring her around. - It's very late. - It's just nearby. - Fine, I'll see her. - Thank you, Doctor. Let's go. You're leaving? Yes. If she shows up, tell her to wait. I'll be back in half an hour. - What is this? - Quietly. Come with us. And that's how it began. They're coming! Through there. Go straight. Keep going. Further back. It looks like we landed to find a doctor. Keep going. Someone gave me a temperature chart. They were all there, watching me. Yes. It doesn't look too serious. Probably a concussion. A shot of camphor oil and she'll be back to normal. If you'd waited to take care of her, she would have died. Prepare the engines! Full steam ahead! 124 degrees! Engines at full steam! Prepare to descend! This wasn't a simple consultation, but a kidnapping. Are you eating with the passengers? The commander wants to know if you're eating with the passengers. I'm coming. Wait in front of the door. What an idiot! Surprised while I slept, I answered in German. How do I cover up for that? If she hadn't come with her kid... He didn't even have Diptheria. Helen...When I think that I left for the station. With flowers. What an idiot! To top it off, they'd stolen my newspapers. The French...Either they're Communists or they're Gaullists. If only they were in our position. Dr. Guilbert... There's not much room here. No, thank you. You speak German, Doctor? Doctor! - I asked if you spoke German. - No. You know, an unassuming country doctor... I must watch it if I value my life. Would you like some sauce? It's excellent. Mr. Forster asks if you'd like some sauce. It's excellent. No, thank you. - I'm sorry. - It's me who's sorry. Doctor? When you're finished, if you could examine one of my men. Take your time. He asked if you could examine one of his men who's sick. He said you could take your time. It pleases me to come to France, in passing. What I miss, it's going to the movies. I love the movies. My! I have eaten every well. The chef is excellent, don't you think? It's forbidden. Sorry. It doesn't matter to me. This doctor should disappear, before he can denounce us. No scenes. You would regret it. This way. He complains of having a very sore throat. Well? I hope it isn't contagious. We've got to isolate him. That would be difficult. If you don't isolate him, I won't answer for it. Oh, there was nothing wrong with him. Diptheria. Contagion. A good idea! I'd make myself indispensable. We'd isolate him, and throw the others in with Couturier and Morus. Altogether! It would become unbearable, and hate would grow contagious. A small revenge, but how sweet. The illness followed its course. I'd created a psychosis of contagion. My life depended on this lie. My fate was decided in the mind of Forster. I was a dead man under a stay of execution. Following my instructions, they had isolated my patient. My attention was focused, I had to observe, watch, surprise. Have courage. We'll arrive safe and sound. Yes, it'll work out. It was a lovely barracks, everyone living on top of each another. I was the organizer of this shambles, of this floating concentration camp. Look at them. Glum, disgusted with everything, ready to blow up at any moment... Tender Willy Morus sulked. Spoiled brat. Rotten. The communal life is definitely an exquisite Chinese water torture. What a stable! - I'm exhausted. - What? I think I'm ill. What's the matter? French radio broadcast from overseas. Hello, French West Africa? It's nothing serious. Paris is calling. Does it suit you to be sick? Huh? If you need me, you only have to give a sign. There's an inflatable dinghy in steerage. Difficult to escape. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. Of course. I put myself in your place. Have you heard of my father? Ericksen. As a scholar? Yes. How old are you? The day you arrived I turned 17. I will remember your birthday. - Exactly where are we going? - South America. And what will happen to me down there? - Forster... - What? Look out for Forster. - Has he told you something? - Watch out. Everyone below! Don't remain on the bridge! I know nothing of this business of a doctor, and a kidnapping! But I know you! You are baseness personified! Does anyone keep you from risking your life? Is that it? - You would like to be a martyr? - I never said any such thing. It's abominable what you're insinuating. I never thought to allude to Erich. Get out! You're worse than I thought. Get out! I'm sick! You cause me grief. So much of it. - I'm delighted. We'll talk when you've calmed down, when you're feeling like yourself again. Mr. Garosi! Would you like a glass of cognac? Thank you. Your mother? - Yes, my mother. An admirable woman. Today's her name-day. Come now, Mr. Garosi, don't try to fool us. We're all friends here. Let's speak frankly. Are you down? Have you lost faith? You mustn't. - I'm not at all down. I've never lost faith in victory. - What's he up to? - He's afraid of you. Here. Cognac is good for you. Regain your strength. - To your success. To your happiness. To love. Signal for immersion. I'll make use of it. Had the radio op told the truth? Was there a dinghy in steerage? Yes. The oars, the gas cylinder... He hadn't lied. Stop the engines! Everything is in order! Lock down! My affinity with the radio operator was confirmed. He'd given me proof. I almost trusted him. I've got news. Fantastic news! I don't speak German. What news? They've announced the capture of Berlin and the death of Hitler. Don't stay here. I'll keep you informed. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Enough, please. Maybe it's a false report by the English? No. The source is German. Perhaps it's a hoax by the top brass, A ploy by the Fuhrer. - Why not? If the Fuhrer was dead, Goebbels or Himmler would never have made this misfortune public. And the proof that he lives is we're told that he's dead. Let's look truth in the face. Hitler is dead, Berlin has fallen... We're done for. Enough is enough. Among ourselves, let's not bluff each other. We knew that it was over and the game was lost. No one was fooled. You played the game so as not to disturb your partners. The end of Italy, the end of Germany, the end of the Wehrmacht. - Shut up. He's raving. No.. Let him speak. The Wehrmacht. We were all in the Wehrmacht together. I'm taking back my freedom. I'm sick of letting others think for me, of lying. No. You're raging, that's all. I know very well why you're making this exit. Rest assured, I'm not angry. You're wasting your time. - You believe in your victory? You believe in it still? Me, I never did. You've always acted according to your convictions. You never varied, before or during the war. You've always undertaken and practiced the same policy. So why change now? No. You can no longer make me say whatever passes through your head. Enough of that as well. Finished! I'm no longer under your thumb. As soon as we part, everyone will do for himself and I'll leave you to your ideas, your system, your Germany. Signore Garosi, a word. - As you wish. The plan for industrial coordination that we discussed... - Well? - Weren't you its author? Yes. It handed over to us all of Italian industry. Yes, yes. Weren't you sincere? If not, then you were a criminal and a traitor. A criminal? Do you know what it cost me, the acceptance of this plan? Do you? Tell him what it cost me. Go on! A number. How many nights? He's looking for a justification for why I'm leaving him. he wanted me to take the responsibility for his conduct. I no longer care. I'm perfectly content with having unburdened myself. What deliverance! This isn't a whim, as you assume. For a long time I've known how to carry myself, a long time that I've known about your relationship with him. Why did you disembark? Out of love? Or out of fear? Is it me that you care for, as you say, or your own skin? I loved you. I loved you. This love, it's all that I have left. So don't dirty it too much. I believe that you have nothing left to say to each other. That you can only repeat yourselves. Yes. You're right. And good luck. Where is he? He must have gone below. Half an hour later we became aware that Garosi was gone. I found this. The following morning, we found his wallet. Give it to Mrs. Garosi. As you wish. Enter. The captain wanted me to give you this. The remains of her husband. A painful inventory. Not a cent. Garosi had not even left what would have made him missed. Excuse me. You don't intend to move in here? Why not? Don't you see what you're doing? No hypocrisy. We fooled him enough when he was alive. You're crazy. We're not alone here! We're being watched. Be reasonable. I don't want you to stay here. No respect for the dead. Let's discuss it. You only respect the dead that were respectable when alive. Garosi. Lucky Garosi. No more debts to pay. Couturier, fretful, thought of the future. "These little white balls at the bottom of a box. "Death is contained in them. "I will swallow one, two, three, four. "No more Couturier. "I'm no more cowardly than Garosi. "I am... "What? "A little sooner... a little later..." This is what Couturier was thinking. But where would he find, in all his life, one moment of courage? Look out. You're going to lose. Silence! The Fuhrer is dead! And you make music? The news wasn't official. Official? You'll all be held accountable! I've something to tell you. Is it important? About our conversation... I believe there's nothing to add. Your turn. Checkmate. Checkmate? We were approaching the coast. The heat and humidity made us dull. - There's been news from Europe. - Yes? It's about you. You are being pursued by the Allies as a war criminal. It isn't true? "Intelligence shared with the enemy, denouncements..." Here. But it's completely false. I'm no traitor. I... I shared your ideals. Denouncements! Can you imagine? Remain calm. You'll make yourself ill when you're in prison. You risk nothing. All the same they won't come searching for you here. You never know. No answer. This agent, is he credible? We've known him for 7 years. Tell the general to come see me. Of course. 54 degrees, 10 minutes, 40 seconds! Top! 54 degrees, 15 minutes, 20 seconds! Speak French, sir, if you would. Without instructions, we're not landing. - Well ? - You're at the mercy of this agent. You hadn't planned anything in case of defection? Nothing. But really! You plan for these things! You cover yourself, you must work it out, find a solution. Mr. Forster, we've thrown ourselves into a terrible adventure! The world is ever contracting. Pessimism brings bad luck. He who has nothing to lose can risk everything. With or without an answer, we're landing. - Your life's in danger. - I suspected as much. Forster will get rid of you as soon as we arrive. - Did he tell you that? - I'm sure of it. We're going to land very soon. I could save your life. - In exchange for... - In exchange for what? - Very well, it's a deal. Well? - I can't argue with you. I'll help you in exchange for your testimony. Meaning? Later on, perhaps I will be obliged to make an appeal to you. Get back to your cabin! Immediately! You look ahead. Don't hang around the kitchen. The excitement of arrival. Everyone was happy. Hilda was feverish, dreaming of palaces. Couturier regained his confidence. Prudent Ericksen had thought about the exchange rate. My chances were slipping away. I had to run for it, go for broke. The oars had disappeared. The gas cylinder as well. Forster had acted. I was a dead man. What's happening? Have we arrived? Didn't he answer? Perhaps his mail is in chaos. Has he left the city? He's sheltered from all suspicion. He has an export business, and he's often got us provisions. He doesn't know our position. Are we landing? - We must get some information. - What should we do? Like the other time. Willy and the lieutenant will touch down like reconnaisance planes. If that works, we will fulfill the difficult part of our mission. Thanks to you, Captain. Good luck. Use the ladder. Could I help you? - Do you know Mr. Larga? - Not very well. Senor Larga! Senor Larga! Take us to your office. Certainly. - I don't understand. - You've seen our friends. - What friends? - Our agents. No. For what reason? - Have you received any instructions? - No. - Have you gotten any mail? - No. What about our passes? This back-and-forth could go on a long time. Explain yourselves. Our government has charged us with a very important mission. And what have I to do with it? You must ensure our survival and put us in contact with certain persons. You can be certain of my devotion and sincerity. But the situation has changed. Morally, militarily, politically... And like the situation, the men in charge have changed as well. Unfavorably changed. One can no longer be neutral. The agitateurs are crushed and the Resistance has disappeared. And our agents? Franck, Schiller, Rademacher. - On the run. - And? And I'm very sorry. If you insist, I can ensure your departure, but I can answer for nothing. You will be reported as suspects. You know how that ends. Hello? Ah... Yes. Yes, it's perfect. At your disposal. I've got your check right here. I haven't got any news yet. Fine. So long... You're with the Americains? No. The English. A double cross. I've been called in twice by the police. I strengthen my position. - And the heating oil? - The heating oil? You mean you don't know? - No. We must take off again. We'll need heating oil and provisions. You'll need heating oil and provisions. No funny business! Not at all. You'll have heating oil tonight. - Not before? - We'll load up at 3 a.m. I need ten men I can trust. And trust here becomes more and more rare. Anyway, I'll do what's necessary. You can count on me. Payment in dollars. - Dollars? - Or pounds. What are we going to do? Get further instructions. Wait for me. - And the heating oil. Understood? - Understood. Until tonight. Wait. Take some fruit with you. Everyone loves pineapples. I can do nothing for you. I'm stuck between victory and defeat. It's a most disagreeable situation. And I don't like being stuck. A little whiskey? - Perhaps you're right. - I told him nothing. An officer looks after his career. - I don't trust him. You... - What? You're a young kid, intelligent, understanding, determined. Am I right? Yes, I'm young. - And then Germany... - What? There's only one Germany. And Europe doesn't count here. They talk about it in the cafes. But it isn't a topic for discussion. - And the war? - what about the war? - Haven't you felt it going on? - Sure, in the papers, on the radio. Life has always been abundant here. No restrictions. Ah! What I've suffered for you. To think that here there's everything. And over there...Could you get me some papers? All it takes is a phone call. Are there opportunities for me here? All positions are open. People are lazy here. You make money in spite of yourself. I make money just talking to you. I imagined my life far from Europe. The war won't last forever. You aren't a man to live among the ruins. Because Europe...I say this without reservations. What are you going to do when they come? - You have any ideas? - We could hide you. In the hangars, there is coffee. Tons of coffee. Behind the sacks...There are lots of sacks. What are you up to, Mr. Larga? You toast traitors? I didn't toast him. I was thirsty. Do you know what we do with shady agents, Mr. Larga? I'm not responsible for them. All our observers have responded, except you. Why is that? If I wanted to avoid you, you wouldn't have found me. You thought your silence would disturb us and that we would denounce you on disembarking! You knew very well the importance of our mission. A Larga isn't a serious obstacle! What do you want me to say? You're threatening me! You can stay if you want, but sooner or later you will be spotted. I don't doubt it. I'm going on watch. Excellent idea. And your men? - Impossible to join them. I've tried, but it's too late. Tomorrow... Tomorrow? What's this ambush? You're a child, Mr. Larga. You can't find ten men just like that. - You're a scoundrel! - Wait a minute.. A base scoundrel! Watch it, that could cost you. You are at our disposal. You know too much. - I know how to keep you quiet. - You don't believe what you say. What do you mean by that? I see ahead, I'm patient, understanding. I know you're like this because you're disappointed. But this isn't the Third Reich. Willy! Willy! - It's useless to call him. He won't answer. Where is he? I've taken precautions. I've got no more trust in you. I'll save my skin. You'll tell me immediately where Willy is! I'll give you two minutes. I've made others talk. You'll fare badly! It's not up to me. It's him. I don't know where he is. He wanted to escape. - So! He said that Germany was done for. - Done for? - Yes. He said he'd had enough of you. Son of a bitch! - He also begged me to hide him. - And? In the hangars, there are many sacks of coffee. Watch him. Willy! Willy! No. No. Watch him. Get ready to depart! Emile! Begin the manoevre! Strange! We were taking off again. Did you hear that? Couturier! Couturier, you're crazy! Come back! Come back! Come back or I'll shoot! No doubt they're executing the radio operator. My turn is coming. I lived my last moments. We're off! False alarm. See what you make me do? Curious. Forster didn't hold my failed escape against me. I found nothing interesting. Where's your father? You must know. How did he escape? The dinghy has disappeared. He must have taken it. Forster knew nothing. Ericksen, with his air of unconcern for everything, had succeeded where I'd failed. - Ericksen escaped with the dinghy. - What? He beat me to it. Our fuel will only last another 48 hours. Tell the radio op to call on the agents until they answer. Yes, Captain. If they're all like Larga... Your optimism won't solve the problem! Call them until they respond. Very well. If necessary, call the central base. - Much too risky. - So what? We shouldn't throw ourselves into such undertakings with agents that are so uncertain. Traitors. Nothing but traitors! - Then there's no solution? - It's not my job to find one. I was forced to stop the engines! Let's call one of our cargo ships for refuelling. They won't betray us any more than your agents. In that case, try it. Radio? Radio! They've found the fuel. Since the time I began calling, they could have spotted us. Some advice: Get on the cargo ship. It's your last chance. Have you placed the call? Thank you. We'll find one of our oil tankers. Understood, Forster. You still believe in miracles? Without immediate success, you get in a panic. You've forseen everything except defeat! I've forseen everything including defeat! My father was a blacksmith. I'm no general! The Poseidon has responded. We will have fuel. You see? The cargo ship will be in sight within 40 hours. The miracle appears! But when our mission makes no sense... I'm a soldier, I obey the orders of my superiors. But where are the superiors? - Your weakness is unspeakable! I'm taking command! A little more spine, General! What do you want now? I want to be alone. My own worries are enough for me. I can't live without you. We're not in a bedroom, we're on a U-boat! Leave me. Leave me! - Huh? - Come with me. He's committed suicide. The boy was too high-strung. He's dead. He's committed suicide. The talkative radio operator had learned too many things. - When will the cargo ship be in sight? - By sundown. Why? How many men will it take to do the job? - Three or four. - Three's enough. Haase, Lehmann, Kohler. Call these men: Haase, Lehmann, Kohler. Haase! Lehmann! Kohler! I have my reasons, and I'm sure of them. They will be the only ones to climb on the bridge. And please announce to everyone the official ban on climbing on the bridge during the refuelling. Only the first mate and I will climb up. It's the Poseidon. It is forbidden to be on the bridge during the manoeuvre. It is forbidden to be on the bridge during the manoeuvre. You have been chosen because you are all trustworthy men. You will take care of the fuel. You are forbidden from talking to the cargo crew. YES, CHIEF. I'll be right back. The manoeuvre must be performed quickly. Our men mustn't talk. - Very well. We're finally going home. You too, you're going back? Peace returns! The war is over. You understand what this means? The war is over. The armistice is signed. The war is over! The war is over! The war is over! The war is over! Let me out! - The war is over! - I'm locked in! There's no key! Follow me, Captain. We're finally going to see our famillies again! - General von Houser. - Very honored. - Charmed. - I am truly honored. I've given the order! What? The war is over? You didn't know? Haven't you received the order from Admiral Donitz? - Not that I know of. - Give me that. Here it is, General. "Admiral Donitz gives the order to all units of the German navy to head for the nearest port." That doesn't concern us! We have a mission to fulfill! I've received an order from the Admiralty. This new order cancels it out! Completely. I'll remain aboard your cargo ship. I have faith in the German Reich. Admiral Donitz will restore the situation. Herr Forster. You can't escape your destiny any more than Ericksen! Hey, you down there! Prepare to go back down, and quickly! Erich? What are you doing? What are you doing? The general's orders. Leave that baggage here! You hear me? Listen to me! Listen to me! How many men remain onboard? Ten. - And the others? - They're gone. Could you support a torpedo manoeuvre? It's true, isn't it? I knew I could count on you. I understood you immediately. We will do great things together. You don't have the right! What are you doing? You don't have the right to kill! You couldn't! What are you waiting for? Torpedo us! Torpedo us! Torpedo us! Torpedo us! Stay here! Stay here! They want to kill us like rats. Get back onboard! Refuelling completed! Remove the pipe! Come on, quicker! We're going! Remove the moorings! Guard post to torpedo post. Prepare the torpedoes. One and two. Torpedo ready. Engines ready! Torpedoes one and two in place! Fire! Fire! Second torpedo ready. Are you crazy? You've torpedoed your comrades! Second torpedo ready. Fire! Traitors! Such a beautiful cargo ship. We couldn't hand it over to the Allies. The witnesses must disappear. Is the machine gun ready? Quick! Hurry! Mutiny onboard! Mutiny onboard! Stop this right now! Bastard! I've waited a long time for this! I've had enough! I'm going to talk about this! I've had enough of this old tub! Let's get out of here. Make the most of it! For you. The provisions! Hurry up! The boat is here! Hand me that. More quickly. Is everyone here? Come on, pass it up! - Is that all? - Yes. - Hurry up. We're leaving. - I know. Leave all that. Come on! Climb up. I'll meet you. Climb up. They're rebelling. Quick, my revolver! Bastard! Wait! I've killed Forster! And the doctor? He'd denounce us. The doctor! The bastards! They'd all escaped from this wreck. And I was alone. Dead horizon. Empty sky. Nothing. Days passed. Days passed that were horribly similar. I was lost to the rest of the world. Forgotten by everyone. A forgotten stop. I never believed in posterity, but I wanted to leave behind, if not a will, at least an examination of this adventure. Something like an explanation. This story passed again before my eyes exactly like a movie. I wrote. I wrote and I wrote and I wrote. I remembered the smallest details. In my ears I heard the voices of my lamentable companions. Couturier, rash and trembling, who drowned to escape the scaffold. Forster. The disturbing Hilda Garosi, Valkyrie widow. Forster. That little crook, the facile Willy Morus. Forster! It was as if I wrote under their dictation. What a strange business! Is all of that true or did you make it up? I made up nothing. It was compulsory testimony. Coffee? Now you will write the final chapter: "How I found myself onboard an American torpedo boat." All that's left is finding a good title. "The Damned".
