Edward, would thou take Caitlyn Mary here present to be thy lawful wife, according to the rite of our holy mother the church? I will. Mind you, die like a Kelly, son.

I thought I'd never see you again, and that's the truth. Ma, come on, you don't think they could get rid of me as easy as that, now, do you? I thought I'd never see him again. Is it ned? Who else would it be, me fire-eyed brother? And what's me baby brother been up to? Ned, I'd never have recognized you under all that mistletoe. Oh, shut you up, Steve hart. This is George king, ned. Very pleased to meet you, ned. He's a friend of mine. All the way from California in america. Land of the free and the home of the brave. Stood by US like the Saint himself in these hard times. We haven't signed the papers, yet. We're waiting for you to do that. Put a bit of a smile on your face, ned Kelly, and don't be looking like a man on the gallows. Where'd you get the horses, daddy? Dan, you didn't... We bought 'em, ma, honest. George had a bit of a win at the cards, and here we are. All above board. Get you something, huh, ned? Now, don't start talking like that to ned. And after him being inside so long. Let's give ned a right fine welcome. To my sweet Erin home. Are you all right, ned? Oh, I'm not used to it, I suppose. It must have been awful in jail. Well, I'll tell you something, me darling sister. They're never, ever going to get me in there again. Oh, it hasn't been like this since you left. And how has it been these past 3 years? How's your husband? Oh, will you listen to them, ned? Ooh, they're glad to see you back. It'll all be different now. Has it been bad, then? Pretty bad... Till George came. He helped. George is all right, ned. He makes ma happy, and he's brought some money in. I know where from, too. Oh, only a few stray ones. And he's a great hand at poker. I'm sure. He's an all-arounder, then. Now, listen here, my thick-headed Irish brother. I'm not having you stirring. Don't worry, Maggie. We're the Kellys. We're the Kellys. We're the Kellys! We're the Kellys! We're the Kellys! We're the Kellys! We're the Kellys! We're the Kellys! The Kellys! We're the Kellys! Yeah! Ha ha ha ha! Kellys! # Me young love said to me # # my mother won't mind # # and my father won't slight you # # for your lack of kind # # she stepped away from me # # and this she did say # # it will not be long, no # shall we be together? For a while? # She stepped away from me # # and she moved through the fair # # and fondly I watched her # # move here and move there # # and then she went homeward # # with one star awake # # as the swan in the evening # # moves over the lake # # last night she came to me # # my true love came in # # so softly came she # # her feet made no din # # she laid her hand on me # # and this she did say # # it will not be long, love # # till our wedding day # Good morning, miss O'Donnell. Good morning. You won't be running off and getting yourself into trouble again, will you? I mean, you will be staying around. For a while. Oh! What's going on? Happens every day. Hyah! Let's have the final one. You'll never get away with this. There's nothing I can do. Well, I'm not paying for me own cattle, you understand? Why should he? You'll keep out of this, Kelly, or you'll go back to where you came from. But it's robbery. It's outright flagrant robbery. What's this all about? They were found on Mr. Whitty's land. They were grazing where they always graze. If the land is Mr. Whitty's, you must keep them off it. Why don't you build fences? Where do we get the money from? Just this once... And understand me, all of you... This will be the only time I'll release your cattle. And take care you keep them on your own land. I'll have no more of this brawling. # Little Cathy # # will you come and share with me # # all the pleasures of a Sunday afternoon? # # For there are gentle things to do # # lovely things to see # # in the pleasures of a Sunday afternoon # # your body warm beside me # # my head upon your breast # # are the pleasures of a Sunday afternoon # # The birds are in the kooly boughs # # I hear them sweetly sing # # of the pleasures of a Sunday afternoon # # they say we'll live forever # # our love's a lasting thing # # in the pleasures of a Sunday afternoon # # and someday when we're older # # with a smile we may recall # # the pleasures of this Sunday afternoon # ah! Ladies and gentlemen, the winner! Looks like he's been injured. Well, maybe he's learned his lesson. Ha. Mustn't hold it against him, eh, superintendent? Well done, me boy. Very impressive. How would you like to work for me? Who are you? This is Mr. Whitty, ned. I've heard you've had a bit of trouble in the past, but, heh, I can forget that. The gall of some men is hard to believe. What do you mean? I don't like stealing other people's cattle. Or "impounding" as it's called in the name of the law. I'll find myself an honest job, Mr. Whitty. What do you 2 gentlemen be wanting? That's a grand-looking engine you have there. What? It's a grand-looking engine you have. Aye. Yeah, it's nice. Any chance of a job? What are your names? My name's Aaron sherritt. Joe byrne. Ever done this kind of work before, lads? Uh, no, we've just come out of prison. I suppose I better be looking after me own kind then. Welcome to the sweatshop, lads. All right, lads. Dinnertime. "The sound of horse's feet "knocking up through splashy ground. "Then the grunting of weary men, "the lifting noise of stirrups. "And sometimes the clank of iron "mixed with the wheezy crowing of leather and the blowing of hairy nostrils." Yee-ha! Get the bastard in! 90 pounds that bull was worth. 90 pounds! A shorthorn, shipped all the way from louisville to improve me stock. You have no proof, sir. Thank you. There's no doubt it's those Kellys. Their house is a meeting place for all thieves, criminals, and good-for-nothings in the district. They say that the mother keeps a grog shop on the sly. Have some more tea, captain, sir? Oh, thank you. Mr. Whitty. What do you want? It's about your bull. I found it straying on my property. I've taken him to the pound. Perhaps you might like to recommend me to be a member of your stock protection society. A very flash young man. Well, the sooner you take the flashness out of him, the better. We'll be first there to see whitty when he has to pay the 30 shillings. There'll be a red face there, all right. It won't make a bit of difference, ned. Not unless you change the whole system. In my country, it's different. In my country, all men are created equal. Then why did you leave it, then, George? Now, here, here they can even put you away for playing that. Aw, come on, let's have some drinks up here. Aw, come on, where are the drinks? # It's of a wild colonial boy # # Jack doolan was his name # # of poor but honest parents # # he was born in castlemaine # # he was his father's only hope # # his mother's pride and joy # # and so dearly did his parents love # # the wild colonial boy # # when scarcely 16 years of age # ned! # He left... # # When scarcely 16 years of age # # he left his father's home... # Aye, it's all right, boys.

Come on, ned. Ugh! Come on. Ah, me friend. Me larrikin darling. A breath of fresh air will do you the power of good. You did a bit of damage down there at the pub last night, ned. Somebody put something in me drink. Why would anyone want to do a thing like that? It was you... Put something in me drink. Of course I didn't. Come on, now. What are you doing, you bastard? Ah! Mcintyre! Hold him, boy! Uhh! Lonigan! Lonigan! Hold him up. Pull him up. Hold him up. I'll take hold of him! Uhh! Aah! I won't have any trap put the darbies on me. Then let me put them on. Ned, please. If I ever have to kill a man, lonigan, you'll be the first. In view of the unusual circumstances surrounding this case, sergeant, I'm refusing your application for a general sessions trial. Silence! Edward Kelly, I find you guilty of resisting arrest and drunkenness. You are fined 2 pounds... And one Guinea costs for damage to police uniforms. Hey, ned, one of your drinking mates. Closing down, are you? You've been doing a good job these last few months. What do you want? It's about your brother Dan, ned. What about Dan? He's on the grog there, and he broke into a man's shop. Well, if he'd give himself up, he'd get a fine of a few shillings... Bollocks! Mcinnes was easy on you, ned. Since when have I become a trap? Look, no matter what you think, I never spiked your grog. You don't want to be stirring up more trouble for the family, do you? You'd do better to think it over. Steve! Ned! Where's my brother? What are you doing here? Dan, Fitzpatrick's been to see me. It has nothing to do with you. Is it true what he says? Don't play the big brother with me! Sometimes it's better not to run away. Since when have you been working for the traps? Don't blame yourself, ned. 3 months. I thought he'd get a pound or 2 and some cuffs, but 3 months! You're too trusting, ned. That's always been one of your troubles. Bloody Fitzpatrick. Why did I have to go and trust an Irish turncoat bastard with a union Jack engraved on his ass? They're almost as bad as the orangemen themselves. What's the matter with you? I've been over to whitty's paddock looking at my stock. At whitty's? The roan I bought a couple of weeks ago is over in whitty's yard now. He said it was on his land. I thought I taught that whitty a lesson. Yeah? Well, it seems like he's a slow learner. So what do we do now? Pay the pound fee? What do you think? Staying behind, lads? Yeah! Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! # Mother, tell me, mother # # where has my daddy gone? # # And why is my daddy always leaving? # # Hush, my child, and go to sleep # # he's working with the cows and sheep # # daddy does his ranching in the evening # # mother, tell me, mother # # why he took his gun along # # for I know 'tis not the gaming season # # well, hush, my child, and go to sleep # # 'tis bigger game your daddy seeks # # for daddy does his hunting in the evening # # mother, oh, dear mother # # I see him coming now # # and 7 bonny thoroughbreds he's leading # # and hush, my child, and go to sleep # # and of these things do never speak # # for daddy makes his living in the evening # # and mother, tell me, mother # # is that my daddy's voice? # # Callin' to you so early in the dawnin' # # well, hush, my child, and go to sleep # # 'tis not the time to bother me # # for daddy does his lovin' in the morning # ahh! Me bloody cooking! You stupid! I'm afraid I can only offer you half our usual agreement. That's robbery, baumgarten. Yeah, that's very true, but in the absence now of any further bidders... On the way here we passed no less than 4 police patrols looking especially for stolen horses. Mr. Baumgarten, I take it you're open to the usual negotiation. Ah, you are presuming on my gambler's nature. Well, I think I have someone who can match you this time. Mozart! Why bother, Mr. Kelly? Mozart has rubber limbs. Try again! Yahoo! Enough, enough. How much is it I owe you? 4 1/2 feet. That's 4 pounds 10 shillings above your price, Mr. Baumgarten. Which brings the total to... Uh, 200 pounds, if I'm not mistaken. The Irish. The Irish I can never understand. All other nations in the world, even the most primitive... But the Irish, never. I think it has something to do with the rain. Never let it be said that the Jews are not great philanthropists and sportsmen. And thieves, Mr. Baumgarten. Thanks. Ned, the way things are, I think I'll shove off for a while. Try my hands at cards again. I'd like you to give this to your mother when you see her. Keep it, George. In view of your... Condition, madame, I have no wish to distress you. However, I cannot believe that in 3 months you've had no word from your son or your husband. Believe it or not as you choose, Mr. Nicholson. You are aware that Mr. Whitty has offered a reward of 100 pounds for a conviction of horse stealing against your son. Oh, I'm aware of that. And it occurs to me there are better ways to collect it than strutting about my home like an underfed Turkey. Your son Dan is about to be released from prison. Your son Jim is still serving a sentence. Your son ned has a price on his head. And you've already lost one husband. In all humanity, madame, I must counsel you to leave this district. It can only mean disaster to remain here. A Kelly never runs away. Good day, madame. This is my house on my land. And it'ill take more than objects like you and Mr. Whitty to chase me away from it! Give my love to the land of the free and the home of the brave! What will your mother do now? She'll be all right with me. I have no wish to oppress anyone, but we have 2 things to do. To prevent crime, and to pursue those guilty. In order to do the first, we must root out gangs like this. There's only one place for them... beveridge jail. A small offense is the best to convict them for. Keeps them out of trouble, prevents them from becoming heroes, and it takes the flashness out of them. But they are dangerous. And I order you never to go near the Kelly homestead alone. Always in twos. One constable must always support another. What do you want? Is Dan at home? What do you want him for? I just want to ask him about some horses missing over at chilton. He's only a couple of days out of prison. What could he have to do with horses? Then he's nothing to lose by riding into town with me and getting the whole thing cleared up. Have you, Dan? I'm having my dinner first. Sure. You've got a warrant to enter our house? I need no warrant. I'm here to arrest Dan for horse stealing. You could never get away with that without a warrant. This is me warrant. Kate, come and get your dinner! When is the boy supposed to have taken the horse? He hasn't left here ever since he got home. Don't be shy, Kate. Keep your hands to yourself, you disreputable article! If ned could see him now. He's there! Mother of god, he's bleeding. Get him water. It's the most beautiful time of day, there's no mistakin'. And may the saints protect you all. Oh, well, I best be on me way. And I promise you all I'll say nothing about it. Not a word. In, lads! Let's have 'em! Get your hands off her! Where is your son, Edward Kelly? Find him. Where is he? Find him. You got a long enough nose. You are charged for the shooting and attempted murder of a police constable whilst engaged in his duties. Shooting and murder, is it? And where did the bullet come from pray, but out of the neck of a Brandy bottle? And as for ned himself, the boy wasn't even here. All right. And it takes the lot of you for the assault on one woman and her children. What brave, roaring pigs you are. Mrs. King, or as you are more commonly known, Mrs. Kelly, you have been found guilty of aiding and abetting in the attempted murder of constable Fitzpatrick. You have persisted in carrying your baby throughout the trial in a grotesque and unsuccessful attempt to procure sympathy. I can only assume that it is your wish that your baby share the sentence that I'm about to impose. 3 years imprisonment. If your son ned were here, I'd give him 15. 3 years! They can't do it to her! She's had enough. She'll get a year's remission for good behavior, don't forget that. Good behavior? She'll have a knife into the first trap that goes into her cell. There's only one thing to do. I have to give myself up. Ned, no! What? In exchange for my mother. I'd give myself up for her. We'll send a message to say so. Impossible, Mr. Mcinnes. Quite impossible. I will not have criminals putting terms to me, and quite apart from that, I do not need the Kelly brothers to surrender themselves. You have my assurances they'll be taken within the week. Maggie! Shh! Ned, we saw 4 men on horseback down by the creek. I think they're troopers in plainclothes. # Now 4 jolly troopers from mansfieldtown # # was sent out to hunt all them Kelly boys down # # they searched through the wombat # # for most of the week # # and they camped on the banks # # of the stringybark creek # # but lonigan's widow, she's singing no song # # she walks these red hills # # and she cries all night long # # they say that ned Kelly ain't never done wrong # # but tell that to lonigan's widow # # early that morning amid laughter and shoutin' # # Kennedy and scanlon, they rode off a'scoutin' # # they left mcintyre to cook up the grub # # while lonigan sang at the old washing tub # # They were cleaning the camp and boiling some tea # bail up! # When up jumped ned Kelly # # with his comrades three # # a shout and a cry and the crack of a gun # # lonigan staggers # # and lonigan's done # # but lonigan's widow, she singing an old song... # What's your name? Mcintyre. Who's he? Lonigan. Didn't recognize him. Put these on him. You give me your word you won't try and escape? Ned. Shut up. I give you me word. Don't trust him, you fool. Shut up! Now, when the other 2 get back, you get them to surrender. I don't want any more killing, do you understand? They're coming! They're coming! Take cover! Get down. # But the way that he's dying # # nobody will speak # # when they tell of the glories # # on stringybark creek # # but lonigan's widow, she's singin' no songs # # she walks these red hills # # she cries all night long # # they say that ned Kelly ain't never done wrong # # but tell that to lonigan's widow # it's up to you, now, mate. # So sing of ned Kelly... # Sergeant! They've got the camp surrounded. # The pride of Australia, the scourge of the crown # # sing of his bravery, and god bless his head # # and Bury the truth as you Bury the dead # Dan! # But lonigan's widow she's singin' no songs # # she walks these red hills # # and she cries all night long # # they say that ned Kelly ain't never done wrong # # Ned Kelly ain't never done wrong # # Ned Kelly's never done wrong # # But tell that to lonigan's widow # Why didn't the bloody fool surrender? Let's go. Yes, let's be off now. Kelly, don't go. Kelly, don't leave me. Ohh! Finish it off. I can't last much longer. For god's sake, man! Finish it off. Turn your head away. Murder, gentlemen. Cold-blooded murder. These are the only words for it. Whatever excuses may have been made for these men before, they are forfeited now. We can only proclaim ned Kelly and his brother outlaws and place a price of 2,000 pounds on their heads. Parliament is acting on this today. Society must protect itself. That will be all, gentlemen. Good day. Terrible thiong it was butchery, Mac. It could so easily have been avoided. Aye, if only Kennedy had been more careful. If only you'd agreed to Kelly's deal. Newspapers! We're famous! We're worth 2,000 pounds! 2,000 pounds? They couldn't paint me blacker if they tried. If only they knew you, ned. Words are very loud. If only you could use them. What do you mean? To make everyone understand. Maybe we wouldn't need guns and powder then. What can we do? Suppose I write a letter? "What would people say "if they saw a strapping big lump "of an irishman "shepherding sheep for 15 Bob a week "or tailing turkeys in tallarook ranges for a smile from Julia?" "They'd say "he ought to be ashamed of himself. "But he'd be a king "compared with a policeman "who deserted the shamrock, "the emblem of wit and true bravery "to serve under the flag of a nation "that transported his forefathers "to Van diemen's land, "to pine away their young lives, "their blood, their bones, "their beauty, "in starvation and misery "among tyrants worse than the promised hell itself." Ah, they'd never read it. You're cracked, ned. They'd never listen to lads like US. We could deliver it publicly... And collect the money we need. Around the back. Bail up. # Oh, someone stole O'Banion's pig # # blame it on the Kellys # # pat mccarver's horse and rig # # blame it on the Kellys # # and someone robbed the Sydney mail # # and sacked the jerilderie jail # # and if the tater crop should fail # # they'll blame it on the Kellys # # blame it on the Kellys, boys # # blame it on the Kellys # # shame, shame, upon the name # # blame it on the Kellys # 'Tis the Kelly gang. At last. There must be some mistake. The game's up, ned. Come quietly. I'm not ned Kelly, sir. But I am. # If anybody steals a horse # # blame it on the Kellys # # if anybody breaks the law # # blame it on the Kellys # # anyone does something new # # or does what you would like to do # # and if the troopers don't know who # # they blame it on the Kellys # # blame it on the Kellys, boys # # blame it on the Kellys # # shame, shame, upon the name # # blame it on the Kellys # miss, I've come to make a withdrawal. Bail up. Unlock your safe, hand out your cash. Now, we're all going for a drive. Come along, Mrs. Scott. Out of the question. We're going to a funeral. # It's posted up on every wall # # blame it on the Kellys # # there's no crime too great or small # # to blame it on the Kellys # # they've killed a thousand, so they tell # # you know they're bound to burn in hell # # I think I'll steal a horse myself # # and blame it on the Kellys # get my buggy, and we'll harness this one up. I'm not sure I'd do that, Mr. Scott. # Shame, shame, upon the name # # blame it on the Kellys # come along, children. They're a credit to you, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Kelly. I must say, you're much better-looking than we've been led to believe. But why does such a young man wear a beard? My mother used to say, Mrs. Scott, that kissing a man without a beard was like eating porridge without salt. Do you eat porridge without salt, Mrs. Scott? Oh, never, Mr. Kelly. Excuse me. # Someone killed old Jim devine # # blame it on the Kellys # # 'twas a dark and deadly crime # # so blame it on the Kellys # # someone killed old Jim devine # # we don't know how he did the dyin' # # the poor old man was 109 # # but blame it on the Kellys # # blame it on the Kellys, boys # # blame it on the Kellys # # shame, shame, upon the name # # blame it on # # the Kellys # Ladies and gentlemen, before you go, there's something I'd like to say. The newspapers have called me a murderer. But my conscience is as clear as the snow in Peru. I have never murdered anyone. I killed the police in a fair, stand-up fight. Though, if I'd had been defenseless, they would have shot me down like a dog. I was outlawed without cause while seeking justice for my mother. If I get that justice, I will quiet go. If I do not, I will seek revenge while god gives me the strength to pull a trigger. I've written a letter explaining all this to a member of parliament, Mr. Donald Cameron. And I would like you, madame, to make sure it's delivered to him. You won't let me down, now, will you? I won't let you down, Mr. Kelly. # The hens won't lay, the cows run dry # # blame it on the Kellys # # something made the baby cry # # blame it on the Kellys # # what's that you say, what's that you say? # # Someone robbed the bank today # # and though they were 20 miles away # # we'll blame it on the Kellys # Take your hands off me! I've never seen the Kellys. I've gotta get back to my kids. No! Bloody Christ! Did they publish it? What? My letter! Are you mad, ned? It's just the opposite. They've arrested all our friends and sympathizers. Everyone that you gave money to from euroa, they're going to try them as accomplices. It's war. Open, outright, declared war. I'll make those stiff-necked unicorns wish they'd never heard the name of Kelly! # It hasn't rained in 7 months # # blame it on the Kellys # # sister Peggy's having fun # # blame it on the Kellys # # yes, sister Peggy's had her fun # # but I fear that she's been badly done # # she's bulging out a bit in front # # so blame it on the Kellys # # blame it on the Kellys, boys # # blame it on the Kellys # # shame, shame, upon the name # # blame it on the Kellys # morning.

The larger landowners find it a sound economic proposition to annex the smaller properties. Do they, indeed? They belong to some of the largest landowners in the district. They'll have to find some other sound economic proposition... Apart from robbing the poor. My life policy's in there. You've got 15 seconds to find it. And don't take anything else, otherwise it'll mature sooner than you think. 8,000 pounds reward, and we're still no closer to getting them. Why? There's a lot of bad feeling about the men you're holding in prison without a trial. People don't want to help the police. # The Kellys are having a mighty fine time # # and the rain is not far away # # and the clothes on me back... # Quiet! # ...sit on our asses all day! # You're all going home! Let's have another drink there. Friends, comrades, everyone. This is a good day. And we'll have many another. Fearless, free, and bold... That's how we'll live. But first, we have to fight. Take up our own color. The green flag of Ireland. Aye, the gamey shamrock. Declare war on the whole English world until this is our land and our law. And then our oppression and our suffering, these will perish like the frost melting on the green lawns of Ireland. Friends, let's drink to it. To our own republic. To the republic of Victoria. The republic of Victoria! These men can track at a gallop, commissioner. They can pick up signs no white man can see. You'll let me know if anything else comes to your notice. I will, sir. Thank you very much. Kellys. Kellys, very near. We gonna catch 'em? No, we'll go back to camp. Come back tomorrow. Well, that beats everything. Let's follow 'em, keep out of sight, and pick 'em all off. And have another stringybark on our hands? No. Next time, it's got to be something different. If there is a next time, and those bloody black trackers don't catch US in our beds. You can't stay here, love. It's not safe here. It's not safe anymore. I'm not leaving you, ned. The black trackers can trace US anywhere now... On the run, in the bush. It's no place for you. Anyway, you'd only tie US down, love. I love you, ned. Good-bye, Caitlyn. # Don't ask me where I've been # # don't ask me what I've done # # don't ask me why I'm pale and sallow # # you'll never get no nourishment # # and you never touch the sun # # when you're livin' in the shadows of the gallows # # and who will pray a prayer for me? # # And who will stop to cry? # # And who will shout that I'm a jolly fellow? # # As the dingoes chew my feet away # # and crows pick out my eyes # # I'll be swinging in the shadows # # of the gallows # # oh, the jailer looked me in the eye # # and said, "be straight and true" # # and he read me rules I swore that I would follow # # well, I pinched his watch in leaving # # for what else can you do # # when you're born in the shadows of the gallows? # # But who will pray a prayer for me? # # And who will stop to cry? # # And who will shout that I'm a jolly fellow? # # As the dingoes chew my feet away # # and the crows pick out my eyes # # I'm swinging in the shadows # # of the gallows # Months and months of waiting and still no sign. Be patient, superintendent. Joe byrne's house is the only point of contact they've got left. There'll be someone along sooner or later. I just hope you're not fooling US, sherritt. I'll never understand you, Aaron. Why do you do this? Why? Because ned's twice the man of any of US. # Now you tell me that you love me # # and I believe you do # # but you feed me lies # # you know I cannot swallow # # and so, you sons of bitches # # I'll be spittin' down at you # # while I'm chokin' in the shadows of the gallows # # and who will pray a prayer for me? # # Who will shout that I'm a jolly fellow? # # As the dingoes chew my feet away # # and the crows pick out my eyes # # I'm swingin' in the shadows of the gallows # # but once I'm hung, then cut me down # # Bury me so deep # # for if you go and Bury me too shallow... # # And I'll wake you from your sleep # # and drag you through the shadows # # of the gallows # ransoming the bloody archbishop. The republic of northeastern Victoria. Every idea is dafter than the rest. Leave him be! He's planning something. Here. This is what we need. Christ! It's damned heavy. The Bible says turn your armor into ploughshares. But I say unto you, turn your ploughshares into armor. We'll be crippled. Aye, you're mad, ned. Mad. Listen, for months now, we've had to run because the traps have had all the power and all the steel. Now we can attack! With these we can become invincible! It's just a dent! All we've got to do is to find the right situation and draw them on. Dig ourselves in. Protected by our iron and our armor, we can shoot them all down! All the traps of Victoria. If you kill one, you're a murderer. If you kill a hundred, you're a hero. I don't trust it, ned. Still... It could be a spree. Ma, I've been trying to get here for weeks. Joe, you've walked right into a trap. The police are everywhere watching. You go, and I'll draw them off. You're sure? Of course I'm sure. Where else did he get the money for his new clothes? This is our chance. As soon as you've dealt with Aaron, let the troopers leave. The first thing they'll do is to contact headquarters. Nicholson will be there just waiting to pounce on US. He'll send all the men he's got, and quickly. All we have to do is to rip up the railway tracks and wait in our armor. I know the very place... Just past the inn at glenrowan. As soon as the train crashes, they'll all be at our mercy. The 4 of US will blow the hell out of them. Then Tom and all our friends will join US, and together we'll ride to benalla and proclaim the republic. But first, take care of Aaron. Who is it? It's Anton weeks. I've lost my way. That's an old German. Lives up the valley. You lost your way, Anton? Yeah. Quick! Hide under the bed! Bring them in. Tell your mother we're here. Aaron? Dead. The train can't be long now. Have you got the rockets, Jack? Here, ned. Now understand this. Take the rockets down to the station, and wait behind there until the train is wrecked. Then fire the rockets. Tom lyde and all our loyal friends and supporters are waiting in the hills. That's the signal for them to join US. Do you understand? Yes, ned. Yes, ned. When train is wrecked, rockets will go up. All right, drop your tools. Now get inside. Still no sign of it. Ah, let's have a drink. Where are you, me old bitty? What's it to be, ned, me love? A hot toddy? Gentlemen, what'll you be drinking? To the republic. The republic. Who's the little fellow with the bad foot? Curnow. The schoolteacher. Poor little bloke. What time is it? 10 to 11:00. For god's sake, go and warn headquarters! We've been here for hours! They're still waiting out there, and I'm not going to get shot! Bracken, we've got to do something about that train. I'm just waiting a chance. Those bastards haven't taken their eyes off me since they came in here. Mr. Kelly? I can't show my hand here in front of the others, but I want you to know I'm with you. Thanks. 2 brandies, please. I think you should know the stationmaster has a gun in his belt, just waiting for a chance to use it. Ah! Come on, boys! I ought to shoot you with it, you bastard! Much obliged to you, Mr. Curnow. Perhaps I could do you a favor sometime. Oh, uh, my wife isn't very well. I wonder if I could take her home. Not now. Later. I only just got the message through, sir. Horses! Commissioner standish. What's happening? Aaron's dead. # Now you tell me that you love me # # I believe you do # # but you feed me lies you know I cannot swallow # # and so, you sons of bitches # # I'll be spittin' down at you # # while I'm chokin' in the shadows... # All right. You can go. # And who will pray a prayer for me? # It'll make you feel better. Thank you, Mr. Kelly. Don't drink too loud. # As the dingoes chew my feet away # # and the crows pick out my eyes # # I'm swingin' in the shadow of the gallows # Stop! # "Surrender now, Jack doolan # # "you see we're three to one # # "surrender in the queen's own name # # you are a plunderin' son" # # Jack drew his pistol from his belt # # and waved it like a toy # # "I'll fight but not surrender" # # cried the wild colonial boy # # so come along, me hearties # # we'll roam the mountainside # # together we will plunder # # together we will ride # # we'll scour along the valleys # # and gallop o'er the plains # # we'll scorn to live in slavery # # bound down by iron chains... # The train! The train's coming! It's coming, ned. Get Dan. Get the others. Get these lights out. That bastard curnow. He must have warned them. Cover the corners. Aim! Fire! Shooting! The train must be wrecked! But I heard no crash. Quick! Send up the rockets. It must be wrecked or they wouldn't be shooting. Aah! The bastards! They shot John! Ohh! Hey! Bloody fools! They lit the rockets off. Are you all right? Aye. All right. Whoo! Whoo! Get Steve and Dan inside. Cover me from the windows. Why, what are you going to do? I'm going out there to stop Tom and the others. They're running straight into the traps' fire. Those civilians in there, commissioner... Shall we give them a chance to come out? Absolutely not, Nicholson. Now we've got the killers, we can't let them slip. Steady. It's all gone wrong. Ned, what happened? Somebody warned the bloody train. The traps are everywhere. Attacking now would be suicide. I'm going back to get the boys. We'll fight our way out. We'll join you later in the hills. Wait for US there. I'm coming with you. No, wait! This is my fight. Where is ned? He's probably getting help. Well, why's he being so long? He'll be back. Why's he being so bloody long? Can we go now? Please, can we go now? Not yet. They'll butcher you if you go out there. Oh, shit. He's dead. Those civilians, superintendent. You better try and get them out now. Yes, sir. Troopers! Hold all fire! Anyone who is free and able can come out now! You will raise your hands above your heads. Stop where you are. You'll lie down on the ground on your stomachs with your hands above your head. Hey, look at that. Look at that. You think we should rush them, sir? No, sergeant, reinforcements are coming. He must be dead. Yeah. 10 count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... Ned Kelly. I told you to get out of the way! Come on! Ned? Ned? Ned! Ask the boys to surrender. If they're alive, they'll fight. I do not wish to win a word of pity from anyone. All I ask is that my story be considered. If my lips can teach the public that men are made mad by bad treatment, then my life will not be entirely thrown away. For myself, I do not fear death. I fear it as little as to drink a cup of tea. In a new community, where society is not bound together as closely as it should be, there is a class which looks upon the perpetrators of crimes like these as heroes. Such unfortunate delayed you pity. Ill-counted youths must be taught to consider the value of human life. Edward Kelly, I sentence you to death by hanging. May god have mercy on your soul. Yes. I'll meet you... There. # Don't ask me where I've been # # don't ask me what I've done # # don't ask me why I'm pale and frail and sallow # # for you never get no nourishment # # never see the sun # # when living in the shadows of the gallows # # who will pray a prayer for me? # # Who will stop to cry? # # Who will shout that I'm a jolly fellow? # # As the dingoes chew my feet away # # and the crows pick out my eyes # # swinging in the shadows # # of the gallows # # oh, the jailer looked me in the eye # # and said be straight and true # # and he read me rules # # I swore that I'd follow # # well, I pinched his watch in leaving # # for what else can you do? # # When you're born in the shadows of the gallows # # who will pray a prayer for me? # # And who will stop to cry? # # Who will shout that I'm a jolly fellow? # # As the dingoes chew my feet away # # and the crows pick out my eyes # # swinging in the shadow # # of the gallows # # tell me that you love me # # I believe you do # # but you feed me lies you know I cannot swallow # # and so, you sons of bitches # # I'll be spittin' down at you # # and choking # # in the shadow of the gallows # # who will pray a prayer for me? # # Who will stop to cry? # # Who will shout that I'm a jolly fellow? # # As the dingoes chew my feet away # # and the crows pick out my eyes # # swingin' in the shadow of the gallows # captioning made possible by mgm home entertainment tantico
