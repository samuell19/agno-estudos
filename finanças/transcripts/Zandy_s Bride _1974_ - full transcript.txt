Eh. (man) 'Hey, I thought you said you put it' 'out here by the lady's luggage?' 'I don't see it out here anywhere.' That's where it should be. That's where I left it. 'Uh, hell, it ain't here now.' 'Somebody must have walked off with it.' You'd be Miss Hannah Lund, wouldn't you? You advertised and I answered. Before this goes any further, we got some talking to do. Come on over here. Set those down. Set 'em down. Now for openers, Miss Lund, you ain't no 25, are you? What else you lie about? I'm 32. 'You wrote in your letters you were 36..' and... and I thought if I told you the truth you wouldn't be interested. Well, you were precisely right there. Furthermore, I got no use for a liar. Especially a woman I'm gonna spend my rest of my life with. Everything else I wrote was true. Except you look on the long side of child bearin'. I want children. I can have them. Can you? How do you know? Did you ever have any? - 'Need a hand?' - 'No!' I mean, I can't tell a thing by lookin'. (Zandy) There were no lies in my letters. 'Everything I wrote to you was true.' 'It's rough where I live. No roads, no neighbors.' I eat deer meat and beans. I spend all I make on cattle. That's my style. I got no mind to change. I work a seven-day week. And expect the woman, uh.. ...I marry to do the same. 'Comfort my bed at night.' You marry for keeps in this country. You go down that coast road with me and there's no turning back short of death. 'Cost you $2 for the wedding.' 'Same as anywhere.' Is that all you bring? (Hannah) They lost my trunk in San Francisco. They said they'd ship it out. That means it's Sierra Nevada. You won't see it for another eight months. I came to get married. I always stop up ahead at the Little Sur. We'll make a long nooning there. Better rest these beasts. (man) Want some food? I've got plenty. Yeah, much obliged, but we've got our own. Easy now. I understand how you must feel after riding over those mountains. (Hannah) 'Where'd you find them?' He seemed to be lonely man. He seemed to be a lonely man! If you keep sticking your hand out like that and speaking up you're gonna meet a lot of 'em. I grant you're not a coast woman you don't know the ways so I'm only gonna correct you once. Why didn't you marry a coast woman, Mr. Allan? Because the blood's all bad. Eh, matches inside the door there. Come on, Cara, go. Wait. Wait? Wait, hell! I spoke you straight. I married you! I've got.. Give me that! Damn you, I got the right! Get that fire started! I want some meat right off. Hyah! Hyah! Come on, boy! Hyah! Hyah! (Zandy) Ah, yes, sir. Yes, sir! Ha ha! Come on! Come on. Hyah. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Stop stirring that mush. Put it in a bowl. You don't have to do that. The spoon and the bowl and the table are the only clean things in this pigsty. Take your hat off at the table. From now on, you'll wash your hands before you eat. You give me a full bowl here. I don't eat for fun. Where's the clothesline? I asked you about your clothesline. Don't own one. If you have any clothes to dry just hang them on the bushes out here like everyone else does. I told you, there are no frills in my way of life. Nor will there be any. I didn't ask for frills, Mr. Allan. I didn't ask for things to be fun. I just want a place of my own where I can do my work. This house of yours is filthy and it stinks! 'I'm going to scrub it from top to bottom.' And tomorrow, I'm going to wash every piece of cloth. There aren't enough bushes in miles to fill my needs. I want a clothesline. You know, if I don't please you you-you know best what to do. Just.. I told you what my way of life was. I got no taste to change either. Well, everything is changed. You did it. You answered my letters. I'm not gonna sit there for any backchat from you! You put a hand on me and you'll have to kill me. As God is my witness, I will not be raped again. That was no rape! I paid my money for you! That wasn't no rape! Wasn't it? I didn't send for no goddamn affliction. Come on, get up on out of there. Hyah! Well? You got a baby? No! Thank God! Thank God? What the hell you think you're here for? My pleasure? I've got these, the five sisters. They've been pleasure enough for me till now. I made it clear to you what I wanted. I don't know what the hell you expected. Nothing! I hoped to find a friend. Friend? A friend is one that keeps their part of the bargain. You want a friend in me, give me the sons I asked for. Ma. Hand that over, Mel. I told you.. ...this slop draws the piss out of men. Next time I throw it in your face. Pass me them beans, Zandy. How's your hay coming, pa? Fair enough. Fair enough. Your brother here did his best to ruin it. 'Cutting it so it laid all wrong.' If a farting rain don't come along and rot it I'll get my pay out of it. Finished with that south field, Mel? Guess, Mel ain't talking to his elders no more, huh? (Mel) Yes, sir. That's good news. Barley in the north field is ready to cut. You swing cradle for me this afternoon I'll, uh, hold us quits on your meal. I thought I'd just swing on home, pa. 'My wife's waiting for me.' 'You want your meal back, you just stop by it for sometime.' Zandy's been riding his new mare so hard his tongue's loose. Break your mare in easy. Don't try to get in a year's riding in a week. (Ma) 'Mel will be going to the valley soon.' He's the only one I.. I borned who isn't man enough to break in a mountain. Is something wrong? No. Uh.. I just don't understand her. Maybe you ought to think on putting in a garden. Sometimes growing things is a great comfort to a woman. My land is too good for farming. It's graze land. You know all about healing and everything.. I thought you'd fix me a Yerba Buena or something to take to her. Is something wrong with her? Is she ill? In my mind.. ...she's mean. When I'm not looking, she's crying. She won't talk. She never smiles. You don't know nothing about marriage expect from pa and me. Well.. ...that's enough. Tell you what I think she needs? She needs a good spring tonic. Maybe when the hay is in, I'll come visit. Well.. ...suit yourself. Hyah! Hello, Zandy. Maria. I just came by to meet your new wife. I didn't know when you'd be back. I've been taking Miss Cordova for a walk. It's a proper day for it. I was telling, uh.. Hannah here 'how good your place is looking.' Yeah. I always did say what it needed was a woman's hand. Mm-hm. You also told me I should do something with these, um, circles. - 'Ah!' - 'Under my eyes.' I didn't mean nothing, you know. That's what you said. No, I was just thinking that, uh.. A woman should look her best for her man, that's all. Hm. Well, you're right, though. I haven't been well lately. Hannah. It's my own fault. Zandy's trying hard to teach me how to ride. (Hannah) 'I keep falling off the horse all the time.' And what about your beau, Miss Cordova? Why didn't you bring him? Looks like your cinch is loose there, Maria. Must have come from all that walking, huh? Yeah, I gotta be going anyway. It was a pleasure meeting you. Come back. Maybe. She's nice. Kind of pale, maybe. The stirrup. I don't think she knows about us, though. Well, that's not too hard to understand since there's nothing to know. Yeah, well, I could tell her about all 'em times you tried to peek up my skirts. When I was a young buck, I used to peek up a lot of things. My pa had a little black calf I used to peek for a while so I wouldn't feel too special if I was you. Who died? 'These beans are good, Hannah.' I thought it was time to begin our marriage. You're over a month late, aren't you? We've been strangers for a month. Not according to the county of Monterey, we haven't. You paid for a license. That's right. That made us man and wife from now on. No turning back. I don't want to turn back, Zandy. You're damn right you don't. I chose you. I don't know who in the hell you are.. ...or who in the hell you think you are. But to me.. '...you're Mrs. Allan from now on.' Then we agree. Hannah.. You's the first woman I ever had. There's no doubt about that, Zandy. Right, Zandy. It helped that you were away for a while. Being alone, I mean. Where I came from, I.. ...I never had time to myself. Always other people's houses to take care of. Plates to clean and.. And other people's children to watch. Answer me. Are you with child? This last month I've been so frightened. Of my son? The rape child. Rape children are simple-minded. Almost always. I kept thinking about taking care of it all my life. And it growing. I was so frightened. I was walking by the cliffs and I.. I thought if I felt a child, I.. I'd step to the edge. (Hannah) 'Good morning.' Did you walk in your sleep last night, Mr. Allan? I saw your tracks down by the spring. I saw your tracks down by the spring. I gotta see to this damn woman! Why the hell didn't you sing out that there was a bear running all over the place here instead of saying good morning like you come 20 miles to see me? I traveled 2000 miles to see you and I haven't seen you yet. Saddle up, Ranger. Ill bring you back the skin for you and the boys if he's not too mangy. Come on. Look at me, you son of a bitch! Sewing and a sage poultice is what this leg needs. Sewing and then the sage to draw it. B-Bill Pincus and.. ...Songer. I don't know your first name. Walter. This is Mrs. Allan. Well, it's about time somebody met you, ma'am. Must the leg be sewn? No, it just needs a poultice on it. That flesh is gonna get proud if you don't, Zandy. You've already done enough. Now go on, get out of here. Look for yourself, ma'am. Damn it, all it needs is a poultice, Hannah. Needle and thread, Mrs. Allan. Just like darning a sock. I'll help you. When you finish here, go on out there.. And rub salt on that bear skin, you hear? You might as well. Oh, God.. (Bill) 'The reason we was down here at all, Zandy' was to invite you and your new bride here down to a barbecue come Thanksgiving down on the flats. Gallo told us to pass on the word to everybody. What do you say, Zandy? I don't think you can count on me. I've got a lot of work to do and... you know.. - ..with this here... - Want no excuses now. Me and Bill didn't come all this way just to hear any no's. - Did we, Bill? - No, we sure didn't. Besides, there's gonna be dancing. I'd like to hear Mrs. Allan's opinion. It would be nice to see some of the people who live around here. Well, hell, you see me everyday. How could you be lonely? Well, hell, that's a good argument for going. I'm not prepared to talk about it right now. Goodbye, Mr. Pincus and Mr. Songer. Thank you. Miss, uh.. Oh. That's real nice work, Mrs. Allan. Really shows a woman's touch. Coming? Mrs. Allan... I wanna thank you for the grub. And, uh... if he keeps saying no to that barbecue you just cross your legs till he says aye. (Hannah) 'Zandy.' 'Sunrise, Zandy.' Aw, to hell with the sunrise. Zandy. Can you see I'm rounding out? We're going to have a new Mr. Allan 'yelling around here come February.' It's about time. That's good. I'll get him to help me with the roundup come spring. (Hannah) 'I'll have your breakfast ready soon.' I'll have none of your breakfast. Just see to the bed. (Zandy) 'Ain't mine.' Do you want me to ride with you today? No, I don't want you to ride with me. You could blame me for losing it. I won't lose it. What if you do? Because you're old and worn out? I asked you right at first if you could have any. You said you could. 'So I gave you a chance.' 'All I want is what every man wants.' 'While I'm working and planning..' ...they all get what they want and I don't. Come on, damn it! (Hannah) 'I'm coming.' We wasted a half day already. You don't like it? Like it? Bet you cut your hair just to spite me, didn't you? I didn't cut it. I curled it with two nails. You're a hateful woman, you know that? You're just hateful. You lied to me. Now, you're gonna lie to the neighborhood? What with your curls and all your.. ...all your fancy clothes, huh? You know, you look like a damned maiden harlot! - No. - You know that? Now, you get back in that house and you don't come out until you're dressed decent like you're supposed to be! Don't. Don't. Don't. Get in there! Go on! You know, I did it for your own good. These folks here have been waiting months just to poke fun at you. 'Boys, come on, help us load the wagon.' Zandy. And, Allan, uh, this here is my, uh, ma and pa. And, uh, right there's my brother Mel there. Welcome to you. I was, uh, been meaning to come by but I didn't have no horse. 'I hope you been alright.' She looks kind of sour, Zandy. Well, she's growing a child. 'I remember how I fared.' 'I reckon you've been sick some, Hannah.' So now you're out to make me look bad, huh? It's not the way things look. It's how they are. Hey, everybody, Zandy Allan brought the beef. Don't settle for that fire, though. You cook my beef with the same care I raised it. - 'Claro, Zandy.' - 'Hey, Zandy, how you doing?' - Mrs. Allan, Zandy. - 'Mrs. Allan.' What is that, bear meat in that sack you brought, huh? What you got there? Uh, ain't that something? I haven't had any cake in ten years, I'll bet. (Zandy) 'Yeah, what is it for?' (Songer) You mean you ain't heard? No, and that don't irritate me none either. Well, if you want a little snort later on, we'll be here. What the hell is wrong with you? I was doing it for your own good. Hell, I told you these people around here are just.. ...waiting to make fun of you. (Maria) 'Zandy.' - Maria. - Mrs. Allan. Say hello to Maria, Hannah. Hello, Miss Corsova. It's Cordova, damn it. I expect you've heard my news. What is it around here? N-nobody can talk straight anymore? I'm getting married in a week. Who's he? Tony Gallo. Well, I heard you badmouth him enough times. Not any more. Not now that he's all grown and rich.. ...with a thousand head and half of Jolon. See that cake over there? He sends that for me with his brother Frank. He's gonna come fetch me in a week. So tonight is my farewell to the coast. What you think, Zandy? I think that's your business. Buenos dias. What about your beau there, Miss Cordova? I don't think your hair looks so bad. No thanks to you. Ah. Ahh! Ha ha! (Caller) 'Right hand over, left hand back.' Zandy? Oh, is that you, Maria? Why didn't you say something? You knew I was here. Oh, like hell I did. Oh, you did. You did because I called you. I made you come. Tony Gallo, huh? 'You finally got somebody to go to the bushes with you.' Shit on you. I died when you married that woman. You're gonna look real funny about your wedding with a black eye. And that's where you're heading, chica. Zandy, I don't wanna go to Gallo. Get off me. (Songer) 'It's getting chilly, Mrs. Allan.' 'Now, you just tell me where you put your coat' 'and I'll get it for you.' (Hannah) 'That's very kind, Mr. Songer' 'but I know right where it is.' 'Hey, look everybody!' 'Wake up! It's here! The boat!' 'Put some muscle into it. Let's go.' 'Come on, pull.' You in the market for some cattle? I'm always in the market. You drive 'em over, Frank, and I'll take a look at them. Ten dollars a head, you.. ...you take the delivery at my place. It's a heavy one. Bring it up. Bring it up. Alright. I'll meet you at the horses in about ten minutes. Can you help me? - Yes, ma'am. - Thanks. (Zandy) 'You ruined this place.' Turned it into a damned town lot. I turned it into a ranch fit for a widow. I'll talk about that later. Get out of the way now. I'm driving my cattle through here. 'No.' What do you mean no? Not through my garden. Look to yourself, Hannah, I'm coming through. Take the corral fence down. This is a stock gate, damn it! Now, I'm not gonna ask you again. I drove these cattle all the way from Salinas just to please you. Now, get out of the way. I don't wanna hurt you. Hannah, damn it, this is no time to fight. Now, come on, get out of the way. (Zandy) 'Hey. Hyah!' 'Come on. Hyah, hyah! Hyah!' (Zandy) 'Hannah, get to the house!' No! No! Stop it! Hannah, get in the house! Stop that. Stop it! Lay down. Lay down. (Ma) 'Shh.' 'This is gonna make you feel better, Hannah.' She gonna be alright, ma? No thanks to you, if she is. 'She is just good and damn tired' of being bullied by you, that's what. What are you getting on my back for? Clear out of here. You ain't no help. I got some milk here, ma. This pitcher is almost bigger than that cow is. Never seen no cow like that. What kind of mixture is that? Ain't Spanish and Allan. She saw you with Maria Cordova. She told me so. What are you talking about? Oh, I don't wanna to hear about that. She's through with you, Zandy. I don't blame her. That was the fever talking. 'She didn't see nothing.' Why you trying to scandal me so? Make him go away. You gonna take her word over an Allan's? I ain't no Allan. I'm a Jarvis. 'Em Jarvises lied all the time. Well... this is the kind of reward I get then, huh? I bust my balls trying to get fresh blood for my stock.. ...over in that damned cursed valley. I got myself in a gunfight with a bunch of renegades. Got myself all blood poisoned and swollen. I was out for three months. I managed to drag my ass back over the mountain to find my wife here just spreading lies about me. My own ma's against me. My ranch so damned worked over, I don't even recognize it. Well, and no place at all here for me. (Hannah) 'That's what I'm saying, Zandy.' If it doesn't suit you, why don't you just leave? Maybe I will. There are just plenty of women like to have my sons. Hyah. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Ha! Ho. Hyah! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey. Whoa, whoa, Ranger. Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Ranger. 'Whoa, boy.' Whoa, boy. I'm sorry, boy. I'm sorry, Ranger. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (man) 'Get out of the way. Move it a little faster.' Look out, buddy. Where you looking? Hello, cowboy. Wanna go to heaven for a buck? Upside, downside, your pleasure. I don't wanna argue, but go on. Don't look like you're getting it elsewhere. A very fine stove. Our finest, in fact. Uh, my problem is, uh, I live up in the Big Sur country and have no way of getting it home, you know. I suppose I could, uh, ship it by packet. Oh, no, this.. This stove is especially built for frontier homes. Look. Let me show you something else. It comes apart. Hey! Mind your business. (Hannah) 'Hello, Zandy.' I'll heat some supper for you. Where's the child, Hannah? What child? Ours. It's long past any child's bedtime. You shouldn't have used your dress like that. I'm done with you telling me what to do. 'I do what I want now.' Well, not as long as I'm around, you don't. No. I've been fine without you. Yeah, well, I know you have. I have. I said, I know you have, damn it! Look, if you want me to go out that door just say the word and I'll just go right on out there. You got the right to do that. But as long as I'm here.. As long as there's any chance of us coming together.. ...then we'll do what I think is right. What you think? - Yeah. - You don't think. You don't know how. Look, damn it, I'm-I'm trying. I'm.. I'm learning. I just, uh.. You got to give me some time. I remember what you said about needing a friend. I do. I remember that. Uh.. 'But just like you remembered what I said the first day.' I just want to forget and forgive though. Really wanna rub my face in it, don't you? I laid up with Maria. I know. I saw you. Here I am. Why? Well, Jesus, what do you think? I want you to tell me. Because I'm better off here. That blue is gonna look good on you, Hannah. Hmm? - What's this? - 'It's for ma.' 'And this is for you.' It's a stove. It's out in the barn there. It's all in pieces and you have to put it together. I paid $12 for that. I'm afraid I'm not doing this very well. Neither am I. What's that? Twins? Of course. What else? No man on the coast ever had two boys at once. A boy... and a girl. Huh? Oh, yeah, well.. A girl, huh? That's good. I don't have enough milk. If it hadn't been for the cow, I would have lost both of them. I never would have grudged you no cow if I had known you had a good purpose for it. You'll give me a cow just like you gave me a clothesline. I spend all I make on cattle. I have a seven-day week, no frills. 'That's my style.' Alright. Alright. 'Alright.'
