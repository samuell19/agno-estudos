No, a boy. wait, my son, little son - Staszek it will be. DIRECTOR To the president, I, Lucja Kr?l ask the president to help me at a difficult time. I'm a widow with four children - my husband died in an accident There's no work in the factory and I can't raise four children myself. I've been forced to move into a cold, dark cellar where bread goes mouldy. I write to you like to my own father, help me find work, best in a factory. I 'd like to raise my children to serve Poland. The President, Royal Castle Lucja Kr?l, unemployed widow, Warsaw. How's that? OK I'm saving for some land - buy a cow in two years We could get married - You're hard-working but you'll go on drinking, drinking and making me children. Cyga - go to bed. A response may not come but try at least you must. They said I should see MP Buchner but he doesn't know us. Buchner? Do you know him? No, but I 'm sure to meet him. For now, don't lose hope and thank you for the washing. Perhaps you'll agree to start cleaning here? Thank you very much. You want to contact Buchner? No, it's that woman's case. She is worth helping and it seems Buchner... - Is she from the party? - No at all, a coincidence. Pension or benefits? No, husband died in an accident, she has four kids - it's personal. Be careful in your contacts, you have an obligation to the party. Remember, Buchner is a renegade. From now your rent will be no problem. 3rd floor, Investigations Bureau Lt. Inspector Jagosz. 3rd floor, Mr Jagosz - I only do this for you. What are you doing here - home you go! Scallywags! Police, they want to search the flat, best not get on their wrong side. I promised to let them in - first, we need to remove all proof. Wiktor- Jagosz asked who comes here and gave me this, take it, go now, disappear - perhaps they'll forget. Don't worry about me Lucja - best not get the police on their wrong side - that's true. Jagosz will dance to my beat. Is this something very bad? Grzegorz informed us of attempts by Lewen to contact Buchner. Lewen has endangered the party for his own interests. They took Grzegorz early, near where Lewen lives. It is known I've been in Wilno - the Manczuk trial, defending him. I return to a Buchner affair - I don't know him. I don't understand this. To the waiting room. Sit. Not us. Lewen says he and Buchner are strangers but objectively, Lewen's heading his way - is he contesting Grzegorz's words? His words, my words, your words - everyone has spoken words that can be used against them - if there's a desire! True, I tried to reach Buchner but in a completely different matter. - It wasn't me! It wasn't me! Good evening Lucja, calm down. I've been arrested unlawfully. This man is convinced I need to go with him to the Investigations Bureau. Alas, I have an arrest warrant. We can't avoid this unpleasantness. Dear Doctor Lewen, so much time has passed since you left Klemens asked again when Mr Lewen is returning. In spring, Roman and Zenon are going to work at the locksmith's, Staszek is over his fever and Cyga the porter, hasn't been for a long time. He lost his job and is ashamed to show his face. I don't know if we'll meet again but I'll always remember you and will never believe that you did something wrong, unless by mistake. Regards, Lucja Kr?l 'RID THE COUNTRY OF STENCH FROM THE EAST' Wiktor Grzegorz. Greetings. What is Comrade's, name? Renard. Grzegorz. - In for... - Five years - taking part in a demonstration by the unemployed. You got a parcel - See, the party remembers Renard. It's mine. Thanks Is gymnastics practiced? No. One's muscles need to be kept trim in spite of incarceration - will over the organism. Listen, we have to be prepared when we leave this place. First up, a lecture on the history of the movement. Comrade Lewen on the main theses of Marxism against idealistic philosophy. Ok Wiktor? Fine. Mum, mum! Let's go with Zbyszek. Good afternoon. Actually, - Take the boys? Out of town, for an excursion. Perhaps you'll join us. - Me? - Yes No, I haven't time - well boys, off you go Goodbye Zbyszek, Zbyszek What's happened? The party has been dissolved. That's a lie. The Comintern dissolved our party. I couldn't believe it either but it's a fact. Listen, if such a decision was made it was justified - most of us, it seems couldn't be trusted. Now, we have to double our efforts to build the party anew. Work more and better. First, it's important to find guilt inside our own selves. Comrades - let's repeat yesterday's lecture - go on... Due to a tip off, the authorities got from a cleaner whose window overlooks the jail courtyard an escape was foiled. In relation to the prisoners, led by Wiktor Lewen, serving a 7 year term, he was made an example of but not sent to political camp because of his health. As of today, guards are to have their ammunition doubled. Mother, mother! War has broken out! into the corner! Someone stole the money! Don't you understand, war's broken out. What will I pay the rent with now? Zenek, go and help. We have coal now. Don't interrupt, mother. - How much? - 50 Excuse me sir, I have children, a son at home, small son, my papers are in order - I work as a maid, let me go. Dear son, at home everything is fine, throughout winter Roman put together a rickshaw for Klemens who pedals it around town all day and only returns at curfew, then until dawn reads books. I'm not with Majewska anymore - now friendly types look after Germans there. Staszek was ill but now is fine Roman has gone his own way. My life has become empty and Zenon, I think you'll return soon from forced labour - I dreamed of you but couldn't say anything - don't forget me, your mother, Lucja. Clean this place up. Yes, I'll make it shine - it will be cleaned up. No, no, I explain everything here - I clean, clean hear - wax. Mister, mister with the hat, help me! Sir, here - wax, finish - you promise - I have a small child at home. Home - you go home. Stop! And this? I forgot my Kenn-Karte! - Good evening Lucja. - Good evening. We don't know who each of us is separately, but together, we would like to impose on our world... Why so late, mother? What happened? Nothing, nothing The 'I' stands for my part in the revolution, my yes, confirmation, my likeness - because I don't wish to be different, to doubt. The aim we're heading towards is characterised by the specific fact that it describes our act like light does with objects. So people die, are killed give their life for things that they don't understand - unknown stimuli and undefined hope but this happens when a person doesn't control his fate, doesn't control his target. Well, we've been talking for ages - curfew soon, till tomorrow then. Comrade Wiktor, I don't understand one part in your article - and Buchner. You carry this in your handbag like lipstick or a compact? Here, on political betrayal. Well, everyone still has a weakness - that's why every foreign thought, different from party demands becomes an objective obstacle for our matter. If you hear 'no', think who and why they said so. There will always be someone who's able to use your 'no' for his own end. This is what I wanted to write. Yes, I understand, thank you. Leave one at a time. Did you know I was at Buchner's? It was long ago, then called Unity. Who'd think it would turn out this way. I knew something was up and got out in time. Kogut always has the 'nose'. ...Madam Majewska? Ja ja, Madam Majewska. Enough, enough! Sztaszek, Sztaszek to bed. Roman, what are you doing? Go to the janitor - ask if he heard anything - if yes tell him you also heard something - that your mother sent you. Sit down everyone, supper - as if nothing happened. Kogut... Didn't hear anything. Hans Hoenig, 23, born Kr?lewiec... Don't - it might come in handy. Kogut - you live near Cyga Tell him to come - quick! Jesus - curfew already! - It's all because of me. - Not true. - And where are you off so early? - I have to go. - And breakfast? - Not eating. No breakfast? Klemens, stay home son. Klemens, Klemens! Good day Good day We're strangers, speak German. Hoenig's uniform fits like a dream. Kogut! The hospital...! They'll do him in. Come off it - soon we'll know more. Please, don't go. Party directive - Comrade Wiktor, change premises now. Lucja, please, come with me. They might get us here. Can't exclude Klemens' unmasking during investigation. Someone could recognise him so better move out for a few days. I have to wait - he might need me. Thank you Lucja - for everything. Take this - No, thanks Ania - I'll be fine. Staszek, wait. Klemens? Zenon? Zenon! - Mother! - Zenon, you've returned son. Two weeks I walked from Germany. Roman is in Warsaw with his wife, Mother, tired aren't you? Come, eat. There's soup. Don't be upset, Mother. You'll see how we fix this up, son. Look at how Staszek has grown. Staszek it's your brother - what are you afraid of? I'll back in a tick My beloved son, I don't know what's happened that you come so rarely Roman said last week you married at first I didn't believe it - is it possible that you didn't inform your mother? I think that most likely this is so, In your life there's no place for me but for what you chose - you didn't choose your mother it's more important that you choose a good wife tell her you're always welcome just like when you were locked up- you'll always find a bed here. Housing didn't place a tenant here though they wanted to - Zenon knows someone there and brought a certificate which I put on the front door - the copy I keep in the drawer because they could tear it off. Roman found work in the factory and Staszek has grown but I don't know if he does his homework. People say big changes are coming - let's hope it not worse than before I think I raised you the way my responsibility told me - maybe you'll have a better life than your father. In the paper I read Dr Lewen spoke in the new Sejm if you see him, give my regards say I remember him always, your mother. Wiktor! Wiktor! Mother alive? Yes - brothers too I knew you'd survive. Gestapo was the worst, then Auschwitz. Tell mother as soon as I get a chance - It' simple - rewards of five- year plans depend on... Klemens has come - hi. What are you... No - Zenon, Klemens have already... - Take it. Well, fine, I'm glad Now, rules the proletariat I don't want them to rule me - but if they rule, be it properly... Now, my son can be a doctor... Was that possible before? Is that why you named him J?zef after Stalin? Why doesn't Klemens admit his wife is a bourgeoisie? That's beside the point. Marta is Marta - I don't get the point. Is that so - then why do I always hear the correct background or not - Explain that for Christ's sake! Zenon - don't you have a place to sleep, enough to eat? Too much to die like a dog, too little to live! - And Klemens, Roman... - Give it a rest mother! Now that Roman has convinced you he's right, write a letter of thanks! A person is either in charge or... he either sacrifices them, or they him! like Stalin and Jesus Don't bring God into it. There's no God now. That's Roman for you. That's the way it has to be - they've got you or you them by the... Stop it! - You're going? - Thanks for your hospitality. Klemens, son - Communist! Mother, where's the other bottle? Don't know. Tiredness shows on Lewen - maybe a holiday? Don't have the time. My quota is four hours sleep - a habit from the partisans. - See Comrade? - Palace of Culture. Seems Lewen knows Klemens Kr?l. We go back a long way. The worst years of the war we spent together at his mother's. - Can be relied on? - Of course - new blood of the party - does Grzegorz know he survived the Gestapo? - They let him go? No, he ended up in Auschwitz. He used your name as a reference at the Control Commission. - Greetings Colonel. - Greetings. When's the meeting? Excuse me... What's the case Klemens used my name? Kogut's case - his death. The Germans killed him. Comrades then didn't die from gastro. wait comrades, I need a tipple damn it... - Come all of you. - But we're here. Come closer. Just this case? The Buchner group and Unity - does Lewen recall? Hard to forget, I unmasked them during the war - they worked with the exiled government in London. They also had spies in the party - the Germans didn't kill Koguta. ...four minutes- didn't I say? That's extraordinary! Comrade, that's a record feat! - Comrade Klemens Kr?l? - Yes. We've been looking for Kr?l - the Ministry is waiting. - But I... - Please come Kr?l. I'm taking these flowers to my mother - it's her birthday Let's not waste time - comrade's wife can do this. Klemens... Can't you wait? STO LAT STO LAT NIECH Z YJE Z YJE NAM... Klemens... Don't give up hope. I see it all, maybe too much. I won't crack - he taught me that. He used to call me Miss Bourgeoisie. - Do you have any news from Klemens? - Yes - he's fine. It will all be explained - - they can't do him any harm. It's just that I'd... do you think he's guilty? If he is, I'll have the strength to wait till he returns. I have to be sure that there's... something I can lean on. Comrade, it seems nothing exists - - that everything is possible. I'll do everything I can to speed up the case - but you have to understand if a larger scale of events occurs then a specific stand has to be taken - but everything is in the hands of honest people - can't be talk of excesses, for I wouldn't agree to sit behind this desk. Mistakes are possible, the party can still make mistakes we grope in the dark, take our first steps, believe this first step brings us closer to our goal... Yes, yes of course. And you must not lose hope. Thank you Apologise to Lucja, I come so seldom all will be explained. As soon as I know something I'll call but don't do anything without letting me know first - it could go against you. Thank you Wiktor I will call. I'll be waiting. Call - did your hear that? And did they give you a phone? Wiktor will call - don't worry? Please, - How can I help, Comrade? Concerns, among others, Klemens Kr?l. There's nothing new to be added, I know nothing about his contacts - he worked with Kogut. Does comrade know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking whether the Service acted correctly by arresting him. Please Lewen note that as a rule arrests are not without cause. Please, go ahead. Thank you. Let me in turn note that at times the cause may not suffice. One lump or two for Lewen? One. Lewen on a diet? As it is I'm a lawyer and the materials used... Someone may have dragged him into this. We don't exclude this - we take every possibility into account and expect the same from Lewen. You say someone has dragged him in - but don't dismiss other possibilities. During the war he could have had contacts which at first he didn't know. Just that. Just what? Every person could be suspected. People can't be blamed for what might happen - for all they do. Practice tells us that some are more liable than others. And in this regard, possibilities sometimes become facts and people are accountable for facts. This, practice teaches us, comrade. There are always two practices - one that is taught by experience and the other, that is created. So, that's all for now, thank you. You could drop caretaking. I could get you a job in a lift. Fool - think a horse can be harnessed to a car. I've been cleaning for thirty years. Everyone's doing a course now. Even old dears do the three R's. I've even finished a chauffeur's course. But the state took your car. That's how it is - one hand gives, the other takes. With your Klemens they did the same. They say if he'd stolen or murdered it wouldn't be so bad, but worst of all he belonged to another cell. If he belonged somewhere else, that's God's business but I heard they don't forgive their own - didn't suspect that. Why - for your own you're the best. He returned with the Lublin officials - Klemens did everything with them. That's beyond me - better to be born a horse. When will I able to pay you back - I owe you so much already. Why would you have to pay me back? Fool, always a fool, Cyga I told Lewen, Comrade Grzegorz is busy. Grzegorz knows why for three weeks I've been trying to see him. Speak. Best without preamble. A person who I've known for years, whose honesty I can vouch for - whose guilt I can't believe - some simply absurd questions. It looks as if during investigation he incriminated himself. Doesn't Grzegorz think it's possible a mistake was made? Yes - investigations are unpredictable. They can surprise the party leadership. Listen, can you do one thing for me - tell the leadership my opinion, that is I can vouch for him. Grzegorz knows that during the war I was under the same roof with him. You never had any suspicions? And Grzegorz? This case has nothing to do with me! I never met Klemens Kr?l. About Kogut's death I learnt when already with the partisans. Yes, the poison has sunk deep. All of us are a little poisoned. Lewen is also being investigated - his contacts with Buchner. I can't help Lewen but trust the party leadership. Then we knew little about people, now we are waist deep in it. Believe strongly in the party. All my life I trusted the party. Our architecture conceived an official who saw photographs of the pyramids. These are harmful simplifications of Marxist aesthetics. Comrades, there is talk of progress and growth but criticism is banned. There is no progress and growth without proper and open criticism. In practice, criticism is suppressed. Comrade Graja please take the floor. The party, Comrade, accepts every criticism, if constructive - On the basis of our socialist position. There is also destructive criticism that opens running wounds. This criticism the party rejects. What Comrade said a moment ago, it appears to me, had an anti- party, accent, foreign, to put it directly, decidedly enemy. Our fundamental responsibility comrades is to trust and help the party. Comrade Lewen's speech was deeply true and needed. Only one fact makes me wonder. How is it so easy to change views? Comrade Lewen should have instead said - learn Comrades, the party, working class, learn from my mistakes - my guilt. This Lewen didn't say. I called you in regard to Staszek - he's a sensitive boy, he understood everything. What happened? It's the arrest of your elder son - boys from United Youth demanded Staszek publicly declare himself He was to declare himself. The boys are very ideological. Fortunately, everything ended well. He said he no longer considered him a brother. He said he doesn't want a brother who's an enemy of People's Poland Mrs Kr?l - they didn't expel him. Renounced your brother, did you? Yes Yes Calm down Mother, that's Dr Lewen. That's him no, it isn't. He would come in for sure. He would come in. Yes, mother. Mother Mary Most Pure pray for us Mother Virgin Mary pray for us Mary Mother of Christ pray for us Mary Mother of God's Grace pray for us Mother Mary Immaculate pray for us Mother Mary Most Pure pray for us Mother Mary Most Kind pray for us Mother Virgin Mary pray for us Mother Mary Most Whole pray for us Mother Mary Most Kind pray for us Mother Mary Most Wondrous pray for us Mary Mother of Good Council pray for us Mary Mother of God pray for us Mary Mother of our Saviour pray for us Mary Mother of our Church pray for us The interrogated subject, Klemens Kr?l, when shown documents from which transpires he carried out instructions of agent Grzegorz, broke down and said it was difficult to believe that Grzegorz's people could harm the party. He was informed that there is proof of Grzegorz working with the Gestapo. The subject asked for the possibility of writing to his mother. Permission was not granted. At present it is possible to establish the ties between the Grzegorz group and Unity, a reactionary group tied to traitors in London, led during the war by Buchner. Mein Got, they fix you up. What you tell them? You can tell me I here for several years. Here, Pole and German the same. Please, drink. Ich weis - Auschwitz - you in Warschau, prison in Gestapo? Is it possible - comes a time the life, when you spit all that best was. Since small they taught me to obey and say yes to orders. For past few years I been judged by foreigners by THEM who don't understand Germans 10,000 dead Jews, Poles - they show me! I only obey orders. Help me! No Zenon, not that way why tell Klemens everything that's happened. Let's write it the way it used to be - Roman still works where he used to, Staszek's at school and we send our regards - ok? Fine, mother - we need to talk about this to Lewen. He will help, we only need to wait - let us know as soon as there's news. Why are you drinking again? - I give up. Mother, Zenon is right - you should maybe he can fix something. Klemen's my brother right? It'll be in my file for good. What are you talking about? I have to have something from life - can't go on like this - work, meetings - all these years in the party - like a faithful dog. Doesn't mother see when I fall everyone will have a go? Kr?l Lucja? Yes. It's about your son. What's this about? He'll be our guest now. Documents please - his things. He's things are not here, Haven't you had enough? Get out! What, doesn't your son sleep here? But you said he lives here. But when, how many years ago? Kr?l Stanislaw, 19 years resident in... Mother, you look bad. Why did you do it son? How long will I get? The lawyer said you'll get out. You'll be fine but you won't manage matric this year. At school everyone remembers you. Promise nothing like this will come to your head again. Ok. Even Zenon has forgiven you. Mother, I won't go to school. You can't talk to me that way, Son. Mother, let me tell you. I've thought this over very carefully. I know now how... Staszek tell me... Please save him - he's a good kid. Good kid but took part in a robbery. But Staszek didn't know That's what they always say. Robbery - saw how it was done. Who showed them otherwise, who? Mrs Kr?l, you talk like Al Capone and his gang. That's how they always see it. Don't be hysterical. But I've two sons in jail, two sons. Nowadays that's normal. I don't have any money though. I have to go. Lord, may they rest in eternal peace, basking in eternal holiness, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen. Lord may they rest in eternal peace, basking in eternal Holiness, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen. Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa. If he were alive maybe he'd help. Better that he rests here. Wouldn't be able to make out what's happening now anyway. No but would sure tell me if it was all my fault - for sure. Accused Kr?l Stanislaw please stand. Does the accused plead guilty? Yes. I feel morally responsible. My colleagues were under my influence. I have no defence. I ask for the highest sentence possible. The accused's colleagues claim he joined them at the last moment, on the way to school. The accused even attempted to talk them out of robbing the shop. And now the aaccused takes all the blame on himself? I couldn't abandon them Sir. I ask for more evidence. The court intends to cross examine without the taking of an oath. What is known to the witness in this case? Walking I was on the other side and notice the accused, 'ere, standingin front of shop and giving me signs. What does citizen want, asks I - and says 'e, nothing. I points out to him his behaviour was out of place, and 'e just laughs. So asks I - why is citizen being silly? And 'e, that is the accused, points behind'em and says because they're robbing a shop there. Why did the accused act in this manner? If it pleases the court, I fulfilled my citizen's duty. And had the Civil Police not been there? Does the accused intend to continue his studies? Certainly Sir. What goal does the accused intend after completing school? As a citizen of People's Poland. You know Zenon, the longer I think about this the less I am sure - They have to be right somehow. What right? They'll do each other in. You know that doesn't justify anything. Klemens must have got himself involved. Go on, inform on me! Someone informed on him too. Calm down. Who are you to say? Aren't I human? Like cattle, am I? We're all the same - you and I, Staszek and Klemens too. Look, see how they've got to her. Will you go to Lewen for Klemens? No. And I forbid you to go there. The party doesn't accuse for no reason. I realise he practically didn't know anything but just got himself tangled up during the occupation. But now, when we fight for ideology everyone takes responsibility! For what he did and what he didn't... Klemens taught me to trust the party. You're not able to understand this? No. This I don't understand. Girl, what have they turned you into? As old as the world is, when they take a man, his woman shouts innocent! Come, mother. Lucja Kr?l here, Comrade Lewen please. No, I didn't have an appointment but he's sure to see me. Yes, I'll wait. Is comrade Lewen now? Yes. I'll wait, yes, yes. Without a pass you won't get in. If upstairs they don't know you there's no use waiting. Time's no problem. I'll wait - why, they have to come down stairs. Yes - but ones at the back. - Citizen, please leave. - But I... We're locking up, everyone's gone now. - Lucja Kr?l here! - Citizen, please leave at once! He's gone? I've been waiting all this time. Who does he think he is? How long? How long can a person wait? How long? In the further course of investigation the interrogated Klemens Kr?l admitted his guilt in relation to murder of comrade Koguta, admitted that he regrets this. 'I was an unwitting tool in the hands of a group of agents and in part responsible for the death of Koguta'. You are surprised. We too. Well, the moment of capitulation is heavy. And to the very end there is no certainty. At any rate, the testimony was a shock for us. Please. Comrade Lewen, was on close terms with him during the occupation. Nothing raised Lewen's suspicions? Nothing. Maybe Lewen can think of something. Maybe something after all? No. Why does Lewen not trust us? We are an organ of People's Poland - before which one shouldn't have secrets. This, is I hope clear. Yes, clear. What is it that you speak of? We possess certain information. Does Lewen recall who Klemens contacted before the war? Why, they were just children, it's hard to speak here of some contacts. - Fine. Lewen doesn't recall anyone? - No. Enter please. And the dentist's room, does Lewen recall that before the war? In my presence Lewen admitted to contacts with Buchner. Thank you. Oh my, oh my, oh my... When did Lewen first see Buchner? I, signed below, Lucja Kr?l, of Warsaw turn to Citizen President with a plea in regard to my son Klemens in jail, guilt unknown. I don't know his whereabouts. I have not been informed. The President should know my son belongs to the party, survived the Gestapo and Auschwitz, then served the army and party school in L?dz? It seems, simple people are better off, so why have I suffered? I believe my son has been sentenced unfairly. I ask the President to help, remembering his mother, who probably is no longer with us, to appreciate my anxiety and rectify this injustice. In this particular circumstance regarding my son Klemens, testimony can be given by MP Wiktor Lewen, also party member. Respectfully yours, Lucja Kr?l Thanks to all us, united under the leadership of the polish worker's class Long live the workers-peasants union! Long live! Long live! Long live! Oh it's you and mother. What's up? We heard that you got an apartment. From who? From Zenon. Let's go, mother, let's go. Come in mum. No, come in, come in. This small one is the children's room. Beautiful! The large one is for my wife and there's my study. A study? I didn't know you did any work or study! Not bad Nothing like a... Zenon, yo're as drunk as a skunk! A separate room for the servant but no room for your mother! Zenon! Soon, a separate room for your awards! Leave me alone, you piece of shit! Zenon! Home, out! Some respect! Interrogated Klemens Kr?l withdrew all hitherto testimony, claiming documents presented in the case were falsified. Confronted with his wife's testimony that she carried out the instructions of Grzegorz's agents, he responded - - 'They have duped you'. Comrade Lewen's testimony was read out regarding his contacts with Buchner and Buchner's contacts with comrade Kogut, who was murdered in the presence of Klemens Kr?l who said the following: 'Even if my mother were to come here and tell me I am a traitor, even then, you would not break me'. In this context, extending the process of Grzegorz and his collaborators to a later date has to be considered. Please, eat something. Where do you think this will get you? For a week, everyone has been dancing around so that you swallow something! What the...! My dress! I've got a date tonight! Don't worry - the date will be a hit. - They've been deceiving us. - Who's they? For 30 years I said 'we' but it seems in each of us there is a 'he' - so I say 'they' - 'they' stands for 'us'. Do you think it doesn't concern you? Why is it we don't know about things that everyone talks about in Poland? Everyone except us. We don't know because we don't want to. Calm down - you're not right to speak like this. And Klemens Kr?l? The name means nothing to you? I know it. He's dying, understand. Dying, beaten up, in the cell. Our own blood, hope of the party. Dying and saying nothing. The doctor gave him a pain killer. Wiktor, she was removed for subjective attitude to the prisoner. I'm no longer able to take it - can't do anything. Do something, ring, go higher - make a speech! Klemens Kr?l, impossible. Don't believe me? What are you hanging on to? What have you got left? Memories, apartment, party car? What, this desk with the telephones? Afraid of humiliation - already a fact. People are disgusted with us! Do something! Of course. Thanks Spaniard. We want peace, we fight for peace let us defend the peace How fine it is in war when the cavalry is the core when the cavalry is the core Stasiu! Stasiu! All aboard! Departure! Stasiu! Stasiu! Mum! Don't worry - I'll be back! Remember just Klemens, only Klemens. This case should be recognised as a manifestation of extraordinary resistance not yet met in practice. The last hearing lasted all night. The interrogated said, 'I must withstand it all, I must not give in - it would be a betrayal against the party. Please say farewell to my mother, wife and brothers'. The investigating officer promised him a visit from his family immediately he signs the testimony.
