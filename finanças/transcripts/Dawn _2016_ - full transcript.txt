(Gasps) Hello? Can you help me, please? Are you looking for the bus stop? Yeah. Right... I think it's hidden behind the tree. I know the buses stop here. You want some? It's not what I usually drink, but it'll do. No. Thanks. You had a good night? I've had better. How come you're out so late, then? You talk a lot. Sorry. I don't really get out any more, you know, since... My mum thinks I'll get lost. You don't... look blind. I wouldn't really know. So you haven't always been? No. Degenerative. I tried to really look at things before... Well, before I couldn't. Now I can see shapes... ... colour... And I can almost see the sunrise. Anyway, I'll leave you alone. I'm just trying to get away. From what? Dunno... A boy I used to know. Everything. So have you got a boyfriend, then? Why'? Are you offering? No, I just thought... Have you got a girlfriend? Yeah! There's loads of girls queuing up to lead a bloke around. I don't know. I can think of worse things than a bloke who can't see. Can I? Oh, my God! I'm sorry. It's... It's OK.

"Face like the back end of a bus," my dad always said. Can I... Can I touch your face? - (Winces) Ow. - Sorry. What was that? My bloke... Someone told him something about me, and... he didn't like it. You know, you're the first girl I've touched in ages. (Cries) Sun's coming up. Bus is coming. You can hear that? Because you're... You know. Of course. You know, if I really listen... Yeah. There. A butterfly just breaking out of its cocoon. It's beautiful. Seriously? You can hear all that? Course not! I just heard it on the crossing down the road. (Both laugh) Sorry. Oh, I hate my laugh. - My dad said it makes... - I love it. Thank you. What's your name? Dawn. It suits you. Can I see you again? You know, I used to be... You should go. The bus is here. Better keep my head down. You just keep your head up high! (Boys on bus shout and stamp) (Boys) Five, four, three, two, one! (Boys on bus) We like to drink with Stevie Cos Stevie is cur mate And when we drink with Stevie He downs it all in eight... (Boys on bus) Five, four, three, two, one!
