Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. The elevator goes up. It’s an ax. Fuck you! You bastard! IS THE BABY ALRIGHT? SHE’D BETTER BE. I TRUST YOU. What’s wrong? It’s nothing. Look in the mirror. Is it an expression of nothing? So? What do you want me to do? - Take care of the kid for me. - Whose is it? Remember my friend who’s going to Jeju Island with me? It’s her daughter. There’s no one to take care of her right now. - How old is she? - 17 years old. - Where is her husband? - I haven’t seen him since the divorce. My friend suffered a lot from raising her eldest alone. She’s such a big girl. That kid will not be comfortable either. Just leave her at home. Her house is old and the roof is leaking. That’s why she has to renovate it. How long do I have to take care of her? - About three weeks. - Look, look, that’s perfect. Three weeks to travel and three weeks to renovate. It’s a plan to go on a trip while renovating the house and leaving the kid behind. Don’t talk too much. I’ll send you the address and contact number later. Take me to the airport tomorrow. And pick her up from her tutoring class. And the kid will stay in the empty room on the second floor. Wait a moment. - In my house? - It’s not your house, it’s our house! No. You’d let a complete stranger stay at my house? Gosh, you talk too much. That’s enough. She’s a sweet child of my friend. If she gets hurt, even if it hurts a little, you’re fucked. Well, anyway, it’s a notice. Honey. Did you go to the shooting range? Yeah, - I went to the shooting range. - Gosh! If you take care of her this time... I’ll make it worth your while in the next few months. Oh, my God, Sis. Look. Does it look delicious? It must be delicious. It’s been a long time since I’ve traveled. - It’s my first time here. - Oh, really? - Wow, that’s great. - What? Look ahead. Thank you. I’ll be right there. Make sure you take care of her. I’ll get back to you. I’m going. Wait for me! Hurry up. Are you Uncle Ui-gang? So, you are Kim Yoon-ji? Get in the car. Is this car expensive? Yeah, a little. She’s my friend. You can give her a ride, right? Hello. No problem, - where are you heading to? - Hongdae, to buy books. Oh, Hongdae. Then, let’s go to Hongdae. 17 years old, adolescence. It is the period of youthful impulse and curiosity. The state of physical maturity, but mentally immature. Due to the imbalance of physical and mental development, young adults today are prone to cognitive errors. The reason why people around are afraid of adolescent children is because they have absolutely no idea what they’re thinking. Can I stay at her house? - That’s exactly what I want. - And don’t tell my mom, okay? I’m afraid she’ll worry. If anything happens, call me. How many days? Okay, you will stay there for few days, right? Give me your wallet. No need. Don’t refuse, just give it to me. To serve as an occasional necessity. You have to buy a gift when you go to someone’s house. So you can stay for a few more days. And buy something delicious, understand? Thank you, uncle. I give you permission so that you don’t run around. If you break the contract, you’ll have to pay me back twice. - Don’t worry. - Alright. Hello. Why don’t you answer the phone? Who answers the phone in the morning? What’s wrong? I think I have a stomachache. If you have a stomachache, go to gastroenterology. Please help me! Where are you now? - Your dad? - Is this rascal have gone mad? My uncle. Hello, I’m Yoon-ji’s sunbae. Nice to meet you. - Yoon-ji, I’m leaving first. - Where’s your house? - I’ll give you a ride. - No, I’ll call the car back. - Hey. - What? Don’t you have a stomachache? Oh... it’s not that bad. If it’s not that bad, why did you cry so sadly? I’ll just go back to your house, Uncle. Oh, shit. What about... your friend? Aren’t you going to stay at her house? You said you’d do your homework together. Hey! Uncle, you go home first. You may see me laughing now. But I’m actually crying. Are you kidding me? Are you? Can I really go home? Go home. - I’m really going home. - Okay. Got it... Be careful on the road. Call me if you need anything. You don’t have to worry. Okay. Here we go, let’s go. Let’s go. HONEY! THERE’S A GOOD RESTAURANT HERE. THE KID’S DOING WELL, RIGHT? Give me your wallet. Think of it as a part-time job. Is it so difficult to help your sister? It’s really nothing. Close your eyes for an hour, and I’ll give you 200. If it’s so good, why don’t you do it? She’s getting old and the price’s are getting low. - Twenty would be nice. - Son of a bitch, you’re crazy. - I’m the one who negotiated with the customer. - What are you pretending to be, you pervert? Goddamn it, you’re gonna die. That’s why I got 200 for the first timer. If not underage, you can get up to fifty. - But are you underage? - I don’t care if it’s a minor, bitch. - She looks like underage. - You crazy idiot. Credit comes first in business. Credit comes first! Those perverts are addicted to underage ones. Do you think they can’t tell the difference? That’s why you’re nowhere, you piece of shit. Hey. She lied to you. I didn’t instruct her at all. But this girl even told me how to trick you into coming here. So I’m here waiting for you to come. I heard you like him. I never said that. Why didn’t you say you wanted to come when this girl was around? But as soon as you heard he was here, you came. Please let me go. Damn, shut up, will you?! I’ve made it clear enough. You know what to do? Do it yourself, mad woman. - This fucking bitch. - Stop. She’s a kid who can’t be hurt. Fuck, how did you get here? What are you doing? Bunch of trash. You bast-- Ouch! You guys go out first. Fuck you, asshole. Uncle. Uncle? Uncle! I’m hungry. Then eat. Uncle, how old are you? Didn’t I give you money yesterday? Buy your own food. - How old are you that you don’t you have kids? - I just didn’t have one. Are you a barren? So how old are you? 42. 42. All right? Wow, you’re older than my Mom. But you looks like you’re only thirty-five or six years old. This kid is good. Do you exercise a lot? What sports do you do? This and that. What do you do for a living, uncle? Why? I’m just curious. You live in a big house and drive a luxury car. What do you do to make so much money? I know someone who owns several buildings, I just manage it for him. Sure enough, real estate is the best way to make money. Keepers are so rich. REAL ESTATE THAT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE Hey, what are your plans for the future? I just want to live at uncle’s house. Oh, shit. Don’t you have any other friends? A lot, isn’t it? I was marginalized in school. What’s marginalized? Does that mean outsider? Yeah, an outsider. Please hurry up. Please don’t watch, just drive on. There’s a traffic jam, please hurry up. Please don’t watch, just drive on. Please stop. Hello. What’s up? What happened? There’s a murder. Murder? Several teens were stabbed to death in that underground ice rink. Kids these days are scary. What can I do for you? Do you take this route often? Occasionally. This is a shortcut. Ah, I see. I’m sorry for taking up your time, take care on the road. All right, thank you. THE BODIES OF 5 TEENAGE BOYS WERE FOUND IN A CLOSED ICE RINK... POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING HYE-JOO, ARE YOU OKAY? A bad premonition doesn’t last longer than a day. Who is it? The detective from yesterday. Go upstairs. Excuse me. Let’s go talk over there. What a nice house. What brings you here? This is just the usual process, so no need to be nervous. This is a photo taken 30 minutes before the incident. It’s your car, right? I don’t think my car was the only one going through that day. Do you remember... this motorcycle? My eyesight is not very good at night. It’s right in front of your car, though. Do you really not remember? Officer... The vehicle you just saw at the door. - Do you remember its model number? - What? Is it a car or a motorcycle? Well, is it a motorcycle that delivers meals? Hold on. It’s a truck... a 1.5-ton truck. Wow, I’ve been kicked out of my mouth by you. However... you don’t seem to have any luck with children. The girl you were with yesterday was... - You’ve figured this out so quickly? - After all, a murder happened is a murder. She’s my wife’s friend’s daughter. During my wife’s trip with that friend I take care of her temporarily. That’s Kim Yoon-ji sitting in the back, right? I’m not sure, I don’t know. Anyway, Yoon-ji was with me. Then, can I meet Kim Yoon-ji? Come back when it’s confirmed that Yoo-Ji has something to do with this case. Yoon-ji is an outcast at school. She’s been linked to several incidents of school violence. And a dead male classmate... Hello, Yoon-ji! Why don’t you go home first today? Okay... I’ll go, then... for now. Just in case... Don’t go far. All right. Their deaths... have nothing to do with you. Let’s go downstairs. It’s dinner time. Uncle. Do you think I’m that kind of kid, too? There was a child who was afraid she’d die. I don’t know if I lost something or if I had nowhere to go. I’m not sure, is there a way you can hope for? I wish I had died without knowing I was going to die. I looked at the child in the air with blank aimless eyes. She died four metres away. She asked me for a favor. She asked me to give her a hug. Give her one last hug. It’s warm. What’s her pain? What kind of pain are you going through? I don’t know... and I don’t want to know. I just hugged her. And at the last moment... she patted my hand. As if telling me she’s okay, she’ll be okay. Just don’t forget this moment. She died with a smile. Why would she do that? I began to wonder about the child’s pain. But I never knew. All that remains on my hands... is the temperature of the kid. Hye-Joo, are you okay? Bitch, you wanna know? So if you want to save Hye-Joo, bring that bastard here right away. It’s me, that bastard. Did you see the news? - You’re fucked. - Did you do that? No, you did. Don’t you remember? The knife you took, it’s full of your fingerprints. Don’t make a fool of yourself, come here quickly. If you don’t come within an hour, I’ll give the knife to the police. - Where do I have to go? - Hongdae 2nd Entrance. Call this number when you get there. Also, tell that bitch. Thanks for the money in her purse, you son of a bitch. What do we do? - She wants me to go, of course I have to go. - Just call the police. I’ll go with you. Just stay here. You’ll only get in the way. And you have to wear this at all times. ANCO ROLE-PLAYING CLUB. A PURE FANTASY THAT ONE HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF They’re all passport holders, though. Why are you putting them on a smuggling boat? You crazy psychopaths with mental illness. Shit, stop talking that bullshit. Fucker. Got it, I’ll fucking hang up, there’s a guest. What kind of place is this? Hey, lock the door. Yes, sir. Get in touch, haven’t you called yet? Damn it. Who are you? I’m not looking for you. I’m looking for her. Is it... That bastard. But how did he find this place? I was about to tell you on the phone. The vision in your left eye will never recover. Oh, shit. Damn, hey, what are you doing? Son of a bitch, can’t you hear my boss? I better shut you up. Bring me the knife. Dude, it’s no good for you. If you make trouble like this, will the kid be okay? Hello, is that friend’s name Hye-Joo? Bring me the knife. So why do you use someone else’s knife? It’s superfluous. - Did you do that, too? - Why would I do that? That’s what this guy did wrong. What are you doing? Knife. Hey, don’t send that girl back... Just tear her to death. Bring me the knife. - Son of a bitch. - Bring me the knife. You’re about the same, motherfucker. Don’t move, though it’s made in the Philippines. But it’s absolutely fine for shooting your head. If you want to save this man, you better call an ambulance right now. - What are you doing? Shoot him! - This bitch! Damn it. It’s working great. Ah, stay still, damn it. What the fuck. Are you all right? Do you know where Yoon-ji is? Where is Yoon-ji? You’ve been exposed, son of a bitch. We know how you found us. If I go wrong, that bitch’s dead, too. Do you want me to dig it up for you? You can’t see it anyway. What do you think? It’s easy to run out of money when running away from home. That’s how the business run. Boys are informants, girls are selling themselves. We use the money to pay for hotels and continue to run the business when we run out of money. But do you know how dangerous this is? If you encounter a pervert and get hit. The boy pretended to protect her and took her to the hotel. Then you’ll be arrested as a liar and sent to jail. That’s why we need an intermediary. Because we will manage them safely and systematically. What happened to Yoon-ji? She didn’t run away from home. He’s Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance... Acquaintance? Shit, just ask it yourself if you’re curious. By now, my brother should know something happened in the dorm. Men, adult or not, are the same. Motherfucker. A little deeper, and the artery will break. Imagine how it would turn out. What do you think? Don’t tell Papa. She’s at Don’t tell Papa. - Is that a nightclub? - No... it’s a motel. It’s a motel. Outside Wonju, near a hole-in-one golf course. Who is Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance? I really don’t know that. Only my brother knows, it’s the truth. Really? Have the cops take you to the emergency room when they get there. I’m at the scene, I’ll call you after confirming. They’re all right. Goodness, but this place has always been suspicious. There are often strange children haunting. DON’T TELL PAPA DON’T TELL PAPA MOTEL Oh, shit. Woah. Hey, fucker. Where is Yoon-ji? Oh! Motherfucker! Only those who speak first will survive. - Where is she? - We really don’t know. I swear to God! I’m just following the instructions. Please spare me. Please spare me. I’m begging, please spare me! Hey, fuck you, really... Please spare me! Spare me, asshole! Okay. But if you lie, I’m gonna shoot you, go up there and do this shit again. Thank you. Thank you, sir! But I really don’t know! It’s true! Shit, wait a minute, I know someone who knows. Who? - The manager. - Who is it? The reggae-haired guy. But he’s a tough guy. He’ll never say anything. As long as you spare my life, I can definitely find out. How? I know the kindergarten that bastard’s son goes to. Is that the reggae-haired guy? You know what? The girl whose whereabouts you’re looking for. Now I’m the only one who knows. That knife is for... Spetsnaz special unit. Ballistic knife. It’s a good knife. Where is the kid? The company has already suffered a lot from you. We’re gonna need more kids. The girl you’re looking for... She’s gonna be in there, too. If you were dead, you wouldn’t have found it. Can you get out of here? Dongying railway station. Heading to Vladivostok. The Irina Lake. At 8 a.m. If you want to find the girl, you have to hurry. Hands up. Hands in the air, motherfucker. You killed the girl in the apartment, didn’t you? I also got evidence of the skating rink homicide, asshole. I’ll find the kid first, and we’ll talk about that later. What kid? You bastard, who are you kidding? If you didn’t see the murder scene with your own eyes, then I’m not the perpetrator, but an eyewitness. It’s not just the emergency treatment that’s not provided for the wounded eyewitness, but a confession is forced in this way. It’s against the law. Are you preparing for the bar exam? You son of a bitch, you’re dangerous. Get in the car. What? Are you really looking for someone? THE IRINA LAKE Hurry in. Crazy bastard, what are you doing now? Hey, you asshole! Uncle. Goddamn it! Who is Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance? Go to hell, asshole. What the fuck. Hey, bribed detective. Your backup just died. I have proof of your bribery. What should I do? I’m interested in being your backup. Anyway... I also need a civil servant to help me clean up the mess. Well, thank you. I’ll get in touch with you soon. The agency’s gone. - What nonsense are you talking about? - Isn’t it from the same agency? The clothing is the same. - What day of the week is it today? - Saturday. You slept for two whole days. Is it raining? Yeah. It’s been raining... all day. Splash, splash. The sound of rain is pleasant. There’s gonna be a cop coming in a minute. You can say as much as you know. - Everything? - Yes. Everything. Where are you going? - My room. - Where’s your room? VIP room. Get me over there, too. It’s expensive. Aren’t you rich? - Don’t you have money? - You just have to pay for me. So I’m paying for you. Do you know you’re unlucky sometimes? You too. You’re unlucky. Why don’t you move in here, too? I don’t want to. I hate the police coming in and out. I don’t want... to stay alone. - Thank you. - You have to pay me back. Then we’ll keep seeing each other until I get to work. No. I’ll tell you the account, just send the money. You’re strong. - Except for a few cuts in the arm. - How’s it going? Almost. Dongying’s case has also removed your testimony, which is considered a verdict. So what? You here to get the testimony? I’ll write this, you don’t have to worry about it. Let’s... take our time and talk about us. Yeah... about the Bribery Detective? How did you know I crossed paths with them? The body in your trunk. They were afraid that the girl would confess to the police if caught by them. They killed that girl. You comply with his request. You went to the apartment and stole the body. - Did you arrive? - Yeah, we’re on the scene. But why did you go to the motel with the corpse? The incinerator is behind the motel. It’s not just a place to burn garbage. It’s to destroy evidence, not to use it for garbage sorting. Don’t be too disappointed. We can work this out. How much do you want? How much can you give? As much as you want. But when you count the money, I’d like to add one more. What? The guy who is Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance. I need to know who is that rascal. I won’t share this information even with them. I’ll give you a lot of money. They’re people with ties to the Russian mafia. It’s not like we’re gonna find out from the investigation. Locate Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance. That’s our deal. Keep that in mind. Shit, I just missed. Oh my, what took you so long? We’ve got a few new ones. Would you like to try them? - I’m not in a mood. - You didn’t use HNK, did you? Let’s have a match today. I have a... favor to ask of you today. Favor? A person who has been wandering for 6 years. And suddenly he spoke so steadily. It scares me a little. Why don’t you talk? - Help me get a gun from the black market. - Where are you going to use it? Don’t ask about it. I’ll give you more than the market price. You’ve seen the movie Ajeossi, haven’t you? The one with Won Bin. In there, his character was told by the guy who he got the gun... “I don’t know what it is, but don’t do it.” You know... what I’m talking about, right? Yeah. There’s an U.S Army soldier returning to his homeland. I can introduce you. What’s the difference between introducing me and contacting you in person? It’s different. And if there’s a middleman, you know there’ll be a commission. What model do you want? M200 for sniping. And... a rifle silencer. Are you serious? - When can I get it? - What are you really doing? It’s just... It’s a very humid day. Are you doing well? We have a week left, don’t we? Are you happy? Is it fun? Yes. Honey, I went to the club yesterday. There’s a lot of people coming to pick up on us. It’s killing me. - Did you go to the sightseeing club? - It’s a nightclub. It’s a club. Nightclub? Why did the nightclub let you in? My darling is kidding again. I’m still attractive, okay? How is the kid? Is she doing well? Yoon-ji? - She’s fine. - It’s a little weird. - What’s weird? - It’s just... to my friend’s child... You called them little girl No. 1, little girl No. 2. - But you called Yoon-ji by name. - I wonder, too. Anyway, have fun. Okay? Understand? Yes... you too. Take care. Was that Auntie? Yes. Do you want me to guess what you’re thinking now? About what? “Can I be discharged within a week?” That’s what you’re thinking, isn’t it? You are the most afraid of auntie in this world, right? I’m afraid... of losing her. Anyway... Eat well and get out of the hospital soon. The longer you stay in the hospital, the more debt you’ll have. I’ll pay it back. You have so much money, yet you are so stingy. But if you leave the hospital within a week, I won’t charge any interest. Do you still want to charge me interest? Yes, 24% statutory maximum interest. You’re no fun, really. You keep talking back, it looks like you’re all right, you’re fine. Eat it, it’s expensive. Did you hear that? Money is a good thing. I’ll have the information you need right away. Get to the point. Commissioned by the Russians. Was Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance a Russian? I don’t know if it’s a Russian rascal. But if Yoon-ji arrives in Vladivostok, she’ll be taken to the hotel room reserved by Park Hyung-joo. Park Hyung-joo? This is my first time. Senior intelligence from the juniors - of the International Criminal Police. - Send me the photo of Park Hyung-joo. This detective, asshole. He doesn’t answer the phone when he need to, asshole. You are the same, bastard. Are you going to the bank? Asshole. Install it for me and pull it up. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Park Hyung-joo. Who is the bastard Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance? ’Cause you’re a very uncomfortable guy. Who is he? Answer it. Put it on loudspeaker. MOTHER PIG Why don’t you answer the phone right away? I’m sorry, damn it. What’s going on? What’s wrong with your voice? I’m not feeling well. Are the kids ready to take the bigot party? I’ll text you when the main information is confirmed separately. - Do it well, don’t have trouble later. - Oh, fuck! Who’s the bigot? You will kill me too, won’t you? Right? Fuck! You can’t just walk away, can you?! Son of a bitch. - Look at you. - Stop talking nonsense, motherfucker! Don’t lose hope. If you do it right, you’ll survive. All I know... is that he’s a judge. Really, I’ve never seen him before in my 10 years of working. I’m telling the truth! MOTHER PIG KH. GAPYEONG. 25 What is this? Korean High School. Korea International, female high school student. The rest is the place and the date. Go on. You know the Ant Museum in Gapyeong? There’s a resort right next to it. You will know at a glance. You don’t... seem to be a commoner. There’s a whole different cast of people in there. - Where’d you get the kids? - Here and there. Boss Leung and I... brought the kids to Mother Pig. I’ll dress them the way the judge likes it and take them away. These days, Korean kids don’t even meet his needs. That’s why he organized people from Russia. Russian mafia? He’s not a killer. It’s the man who runs the hotel and does the women’s business. Now the business has expanded to Vladivostok. That’s where the judge’s bodyguard was hired. Pulling Koreans to Russia for sex? If it’s useless, they will throw them away? That’s the Korean Wave. That’s a cultural exchange, dammit. Koreans go to Russia, Russians go to Southeast Asia, Southeast Asians go to South Korea. It’s a trade, an entertainment company. Goddamn, I’m the entertainment representative. More and more customers want to eat a variety of styles. And they can’t die. JH, CH, AHC. I can get it for you, okay? Hello? Who is this? I heard that you have already washed your hands with gold, haven’t you? Hey, put your hat on. Mind your own business. It’s you, I heard you retired. Well, this, you’re sick. Go to the hospital. I had no choice. There will be a big clean-up in Gapyeong soon. Let me sort it out one last time. I’ve only been doing special cleaning lately. I only sort out the legal corpses, like loneliness or suicide. Let me be the father I deserve to be to my children. These days, only rich dads are worthy dads. I’ll double your official price anyway. They say it’s not about money, really. Triple. Four times. I’ll call you. Hey, can you hurry up? Gosh. - Looks like we’re off today. - Of course, I need to rest. Are you going to open the door and advertise that I’m selling guns? Where’s the stuff? You really have to thank me. You know, I’d never touch these things in the first place. Is it this one? No regrets. The American who helped me with this stuff, he has been flying away since dawn. You can’t return them. - What if there are defects? - You know everything you need to know. Do I have to take the receipt and return it? If it is broken, do I need to go to the maintenance center for repairs? This is the one I asked for, right? I don’t know, either. What should I do if the package is not the same as what I want? That kid has traded with me countless times. - Didn’t you say you wouldn’t touch this? - I don’t. First of all, not bricks. I thought there would be tanks coming out. Hmm, wait a minute. Didn’t you say you had 30 years of experience? Didn’t I just want to make sure? Just checking it. Checking! It doesn’t seem like that... Yes, what’s wrong? Where are you? How is your body? They said I’m going home in a few days, and it has been fixed. It’s nice to be young. But what’s wrong? Nothing. I just called you. Then why bother calling when you have nothing to say? Hye-Joo’s mother came today. What did she say? She said... that Hye-Joo committed suicide. She said that Hye Joo’s death was my fault. When are you coming here? Maybe later in the evening. Can’t you come a little faster? Okay. Hey, bribed detective. How many times have I told you to call from an illegally registered cell phone? Who told you not to answer the phone on time? Am I playing? Anyway, the woman who said she was Yoonji’s mother... wasn’t her biological mother. Her biological father died in an accident three years ago. It was her stepmother who took her. The judge you asked me to investigate? He’s the Chief Justice of the Central District Court. The family’s got a lot of wealth. Political influence is also very strong. Why do I need to investigate such a big guy? It’s really annoying. Please do me a favor. Alex? Borysk? Edvichar? Edvichar? Put the gun down. Put the gun down, you bastard. How about it? Are you all set, Officer Lee? Yeah, it’s all taken care of. This is a terrible man. Look at this knife. Where did the gun come from? Really. Is it you? Yoon-ji’s close acquaintance? I’m Kim Jong-Moon. I heard Officer Lee say... you’re a well-known contractor. What’s wrong? A wealthy contractor or a rich and powerful judge. Isn’t there an answer at first sight? - It’s really the personality. - Officer Lee, please dispose of him. Don’t worry, I’ll make it look like a suicide. Hey, get this bastard’s gun. Let’s go. That uncle is scary, isn’t he? I will put you at ease. You know I have evidence of your bribery, right? That perverted judge will help me. Isn’t that... what power is used for? You have to use the good stuff together. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you know why I let myself get caught? To see the judge’s face. Wait a moment-- Put on your clothes. You don’t have to look around. Nobody’s coming anyway. I’m... a candidate for the next Supreme Court justice. I owe you a favor... and it will be good for you in the future. Sounds great. Just a call from me. You will be acquitted of everything that’s happened so far. Including... - what’s to come. - Where’s Mother Pig? That’s right, Mother Pig. It’s all the kid’s mother’s fault. It turned out to be someone who buys and sells women in the upper class. Now she’s under arrest for dealing with minors. She was the one who made the aid first. She’s worse than I am. She’s a crazy woman. That’s why... you blamed the crime on Detective Lee and the woman. Let’s clean it up. What do you think? So I’m gonna... go ahead and do this? Because of you, my abilities are limited. How else can I help you find the kid? I’m not capable of that. All we can do is to watch porn. Then again, who’s in charge here? Mother Pig! I blame that woman for everything. That is to say, I can start from there. Do you want to start? Start what? Start. - It’s amazing. - Yeah, I’m telling the truth. Hyun Soo, I’m going to the toilet. - Okay, I’ll take a look at the sea. - Okay. JUDGE KIM Yes, oppa. I’m sorry. This is how it turned out. I’ll find you another young... Your brother’s not here right now. How much do you know about me? As long as my wife is involved, I become very sensitive. Calm down. What is the reason for approaching my wife? I heard... her husband owns several buildings. That’s why you used your daughter? - Because of money? - To be honest... Are there any men who don’t like young meat? Drive. Stop here. I’ll take care of Yunji until she grows up. The result is still the same. Goddamn it, men are all the same. Fuck, what a dirty bitch. That kind of woman deserves to die! There’s no one in this world who deserves to die. Wow, you can be a photographer. I kept my promise.
