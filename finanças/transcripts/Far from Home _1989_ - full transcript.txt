September 3rd. I can't believe it's finally over. The summer vacation every girl dreams of. Sure. 17 national parks in 28 days, and all in the company of her dad. It's like being trapped in a Father Knows Best rerun. Except for this father doesn't know anything. I wish he'd get it through his head that tomorrow I turn 14, not 12. Madeline's parents took her to Europe and let her go to discos every night. My dad's idea of independence is letting me roast my own marshmallows. Which is a good idea since he always burns his. Anyway, it'll all be over tonight. Tomorrow I'll be back with Mom celebrating my birthday and staying in my own room. No more sleeping in bags, thank God. What's the problem, huh? Just... There's gotta be another gas station around here somewhere. Let's see, it's 36 miles to the next exit. That's not gonna be any good. What's this? "Banco." Looks like 10 or 12 miles down there. Open the door. Hello? Anybody here? Hello. Hello. Hello? Put 'em up! Put your hands where I can see 'em. Snoopin' around. Oh, shit. Who you with, man? Who you with? Nobody. I just want some gas. It's a gas station, isn't it? It's a gas station, but I ain't got no gas. I've got cash. Ha! I don't care if you got gold hubcaps, man. I said I ain't got no gas, you dig? The delivery's overdue. Maybe tomorrow. Where you headed, man? Home. Los Angeles. Oh, yeah? L.A., huh? Far out. I did some time there. That is before I got some intelligence. Is she with you? Yeah. Look, can I use the phone? I ain't got one. Try the mini-mart. - Hi. - Hi. Will my car be all right? - Yeah, yeah. - If I keep an eye on it for you. - How much? - No, you see, that's it, man. That's what's wrong with this world. Everything's about money. I'll watch your car for you. For nothing. All right, thank you. Let's go. Praise the lord. Beware, sinners, the apocalypse is coming. Get a hold of yourself, all right? Come on. You say they took no money out of the register. You're sure? Are you okay, Mary? All right. Don't touch nothing. There might be prints or something here. You looking for something? Yeah, I wanted to use the phone. Ah. Is there some problem? Son, you got some I.D.? Name's Charlie Cox, Sheriff. Highways magazine, Los Angeles. You're off your beat a little, aren't you, Charlie? Please, we've just run out of gas. Try the trailer park down the road. Agnes Reed might sell you some. Hell, she sells everything else. She's got a phone there anyway. What happened? Somebody come in here, blew a good chunk of Farrell Hovis's brains all over the videotapes, that's what happened. Come on. Most likely a drifter. Happens out here, Charlie. Hello. Hello! Who's there? Hi. We'd like to buy some gas, please. Ain't got any. Well, how about a phone? Can we use the phone? You got any money? Yes, I've got money. Can't be too careful. $2.00 phone charge. It's okay, I'm calling collect. $2.00 phone charge. Okay. It's down the hall, man. You'll die. Can I have a soda? How much for two sodas? A buck each. Surprise, surprise. Got any ice? Another buck. Is that per cube? Ice is out there. Hi, Phil. How are you? Good, good. Listen, I'm not gonna get the article in tonight. It's hot out here. Is it always this hot? Mm-hmm. I don't know. Somewhere in Nevada. Phil, trust me on this, okay. It's really too much to read over the phone. Give me a break, will you? The troll that runs this place charges by the second. Joleen? Joleen? What's going on? Nothing. Then get out of here! Charming kid. Your neighbor's? Ah, he's mine. Always threatening to run away. Never does. Right. Look, I have to get back to L.A. by tonight. Ain't gonna happen 'less your car runs on dirt. Got a couple others stranded here, too. Fixed 'em up real nice. Camper, full view of the pool, kitchen. Got one more left. Shit. How much? For you, 50 bucks. 50 bucks? Out of the question. 50 bucks for this? Aw, come on, it's not that bad. Just right for a night. This is how real writers live. In overpriced campers? Shit. God, it's hot in here. Can I go swimming? Okay, but you go straight there-- And come straight back. Stay away from that boy. You mean all boys, don't you? You know which one I'm talking about. Dad, I'm not 12 years old anymore. I know you're not. That's the problem. And keep your shirt on till you get to the pool. Have fun. Help me. Ohh! Aah! Ohh! Ohh! Aah! Ohh! Ohh! Aah! Hi. Who are you? Pinky. Uhh... - What's your name? - Joleen. Joleen? That sounds kind of funny. Look who's talking, Pinky. Do you hear that? What? I hear your mother calling. Hi. I'm Jimmy. Hi. I'm-- I know. I saw you watching them. I don't know what you're talking about. You know what they were doing? Joleen! Don't answer. Coming. I have to go. Jeez, it's beautiful. Sunset's the only good thing about this place. You'd think somebody'd come out and enjoy it. During primetime? Are you joking? Start dinner, okay? I'll be right back. Hello. Charlie Cox here. Temporary neighbor. What is it? Me and my daughter are stranded here in your...lovely town, and we were wondering if you had any gas to sell. No. Beat it. Thanks. Enjoy. Don't give me that crap again! But it's true. What do you mean you got no money? Where's your mom? At her sister's. "At her sister's." Listen, you're late with the rent a week and two days. You got that? What are you looking at? You better cough up that cash. I'm gonna kick your butts out of here. I ain't shittin' ya. Hello. Fuck off. Hello. Charlie Cox here. Temporary neighbor and concerned parent. Single parent. Former angry young man and poet laureate of the interstate highway system. And you're looking for a little woman to start a new life with? Actually, I was looking for a little cup of gasoline to start an old car with. You're not from around here, are you? Amy, a real human. Oh, please God, let it be a human with some cigarettes. - Hi. - Hi. He's not from around here. He smokes. Let's go for the big win. Does he want a beer? Sure. What do I win? You win a beer. Ali-oop. The price is kind of crazy. If you've got a little boy in your home, regardless of the age-- ha ha ha. Stay with me on the very next item up. Look at it, club. There is a remote-control pickup This one is gorgeous. It is the wild-- Dinnertime! Hey, Jo. Sorry I'm late. It looks like we're gonna miss the first day of school. I met a couple of people, though. Louise and Amy. Louise and Amy, huh? Yeah, Louise and Amy, huh. They're stranded here just like us. Take $5.00 off that price, and we'll let it go at $12.50. Just watch it! Where have you been? Out. Out where? Outside. If you've done some comparison shop-- Dinnertime! Thank God, some quiet. Mm-hmm. They finally turned that thing off. You know, if you worked on a computer like everyone else, you'd be done by now. Mm-hmm. Hey, Dad, do you mind if I go out with a few bikers tonight, you know, have some laughs? Sure. I thought you told him you were finished. I lied. Guess your mom's right. I am a pretty bad influence on you, huh? You should see the guy she's dating now. Look, I'm really not ready to hear about the man your mom's dating, all right? I'm sorry, Dad. You promised Aquaboy fish sticks. They're too expensive. These are just as good. Eat 'em. I wanted Aquaboy. They're the same. They are not. I'm warning you. Where's the coupon? There's no coupon. Just shut up and eat it! If you loved us... Yum, "Disodium inosinate pyridoxine hydrochloride." These are poison. Poison? Poison. Mommy... They're good. They're good. They're perfectly fine. Now eat 'em! Is that what your mom and I sounded like? No. You never sounded like you hated each other. Well, that's 'cause we didn't. We loved each other. A lot. I warned you! It's just that we... never could seem to... Shut up! Do you still love her? Yeah. Do you think... Never mind. What? Nothing. It's an unfair question, Daddy. Poison, poison, poison, poison, poison. You promised us Aquaboy. Yeah. You little bitch! Ooh, Mommy said a bad word. Get out of here! Get up. Get the fuck in here, you little witch! Get over there and sit down. You're just like your father, you little shit. At least my father had the good sense to leave you, Mom. My first and I guess last night in Banco, Nevada. It's probably one of the shittiest places in the whole world. I can't get the picture of that poor man's body in the mini-mart out of my mind. And the woman next door won't shut up. It's driving me crazy. On the other hand, there's this boy, Jimmy. Tall, intense eyes, so incredibly gorgeous I just want to die. And he likes me. Too bad we're leaving tomorrow. Wait a minute. This is gonna take some careful planning. Ohh! Oh, God. Oh-oh-omm. Ha-ha, pfft! They scatter. Get out of the way! Come on! Time now for What's Cooking with Barley. Morning, Jo. Birthday kiss. Sorry I haven't shaved, little lady. Dad, not first thing in the morning. Come on. I owe you. When we get to L.A. I'll take you out for a totally awesome birthday dinner, dude. You can even bring that boy I never liked. I'm not friends with him anymore. Happy birthday. Come on, we can go to that place you love. It'll be great. Deal? Deal? Dad! Aah! Dad, please! Oh, no, no, no! Dad! Oh! Come on, up and at 'em, let's go. Come on. Ow. All right, maybe 14 is too old for a babysitter, but you're not safe hanging around here by yourself. Anyway, Louise and Amy are a lot of fun. On my way. I thought I'd help. It's only fair. Hi. I'm Louise. Hi. Happy birthday, Joleen. Amy! Come on, get up. Entertain Joleen. What is this, the loud patrol? Let's go, Charlie. Bye. He's so perky in the morning. Your father's a good sport. No, he's not. He's single. Oh. Well, come on in. We'll have some fun. Here, see if that fits. Thanks, Duckett. Hi. You're Joleen's dad, aren't ya? That's right. I'm Pinky Sears. Hi, Pinky. Nice to meet you. What's this? It's a secret. Say hi to your mom. Nice kid. Can we fill her up? No. What, the gas truck didn't come? No. Someone in Nevada's got to be able to sell us some gas. Well, I got a friend, old Viney. She lives out by Two Rock, about 30 miles out. She might have some. That does us a lot of good. We have no way of getting over there. I didn't say that. You've got gas? Yeah. Personal stash for emergencies. Can you sell us some? No. Might give you a ride out there, though. How much? Whatever you want. You know, man. You're really starting to piss me off. I told you already, I no longer worship at the altar of Mammon. The word "money" means nothing to me. Mr. Duckett, does the word "Thai stick" mean anything to you? Yeah. Jail. Well, how about "please"? That's the word. Mr. Duckett, this fence here-- Yeah, it's Federal land. 27 miles on the road over to Two Rock. Only ten in this direction. Naturally, the dickheads put up a fence. Of course, we got to boogie through here pretty quick. What kind of Federal land? Nuclear dump. God, I love the desert! I feel like part of me is missing. I still love him. So...um... do you wanna play some cards or something? Are you sure? Want some potato chips? No, thank you. Okay. Oh, my soap's about to start. You wanna watch some TV? I think I'm gonna go for a swim. Oh, okay. Hey, Viney. Get over here. Howdy do, Duckey! We're here. Oh, that's my girl. That's my girl. Hi. Pleasure to meet you, too. Look, have you got any gas to sell? No. Well, bummer. Guess that's that. Hold on. There's got to be gas in the tanks of these cars. I drain 'em when they bring 'em in. 'Course I might not have gotten to that one there. And there might be a gallon in this one. Yeah, now that I think about it, there might just be quite a few gallons around here. You brung me a live one, Duckey. Thought you didn't worship at the altar of money. I don't, but old Viney here is a true believer. Ha ha ha ha! September 4th. Happy birthday to me. So here I am at the pool again. Madeline's always telling me to go for it. Easy for her to say. I always end up feeling like a geek. Dad was right. I'm keeping my shirt on today. God, that was embarrassing for him to see me like that. I want him to kiss me, but I'm really scared. What if he's not around today? What if he's gone somewhere? What if he's not-- Hi. Did I scare you? No, I just wasn't expecting-- I know who you're waiting for. I'm not waiting for anybody. I know you like him, but there's a lot about him you don't know. Like what? You got a problem, Pink-ass? No. Then what are you staring at? Nothing. You saying I'm nothing? No, I was just-- Just leaving. I'll see you later, Joleen. Bye, Pinky. Come on. Why are you so mean to him? Because he's just too weird. Come on. Come on. I can't. My dad wants me to stay here. You always do everything your daddy says? Come on. Jimmy, Jim, James. I wonder if he's got another girlfriend. I guess I could ask, but it seems like a pretty dumb question. And he's definitely not the kind of guy who likes dumb questions. So serious. Something about him, though, is a little...scary. Sort of dangerous, but not really. Not underneath. I know that's just me being afraid. Well, here goes. Where to? Um...I don't know. Someplace cold. Alaska maybe. From your dad? Yeah. Yep. You want to go with me? Wouldn't it be great? Hawaii first, then Switzerland. We could leave tonight. I know where to get the money. Are you hot? That's a dumb question. Whoo! Aah! Jimmy! Aah! Stop! Stop. Aah! Jimmy! No, you have to. Stop it! Jimmy! Jimmy! Stop it! Aah! No! Stop it! Oh! Unh! Aah! No! Jimmy, stop! Stop! Oh, God! Get off of me! Jimmy! Unh! Aah! Aah! Come on, Joleen! I'm gonna kill you. Get outta the water. Come on. You fuck! Unh! Get off me! Unh! Come on. Come on. Let go! Drink it! Drink it! No! Aah! Unh! Come on. Come on. Where are we going, the moon? Whoa. Do you think he's still out there? Don't worry, Joleen, I'll protect you. Your turn, you suck. This is the last of them. How much gas have we got? 11 gallons! 11. That's 5 and a half apiece. Amy's rabbit gets 36 to the gallon-- That's 200 miles. That'll at least get us back to California. How far can you get on 5 and a half gallons? I only get 8 or 10 miles to the gallon. Oh, well, we can carpool. We'll take the rabbit, it'll be fun. What, and leave my Rambler here? Yeah, the black market's just bustin' for a gem that gets a whole 9 to the gallon. Okay, okay, are we done here? I have to see if Jo's all right. You know, when we were little, me and Jimmy used to hang out together all the time. You know, watch TV, shoot bottles, that kind of stuff. He used to be really nice. My God, he's such a bastard. I think he has problems at home. Doesn't everybody? I don't. What's that? A microwave relay. Neat, huh? Brings us TV. Pinky! Oh, my God. Quick! Pinky! Pinky! I gotta fuckin' talk to her. Open this-- Joleen? Joleen! Warm. Shit! Mrs. Reed! Mrs. Reed, I need some ice. The fridge shorted out again. Mrs. Reed? Hello? What's the matter,'fraidy cat? It's only a tiny little bird. Anybody home? My God, you scared me! Is your mother home? She's in the bathroom. Can I sit down and wait for her? Come on, get up that ladder! No, I'm scared to go up high. I get height-rophobia! No, I don't wanna! Come on... You can't make me do it, You can't make me! Whoo! He do'd it! Stay down. I don't see him. Where is he? There. Look. It's okay now. Oh, that was close. Not that close. Were you scared? No. You were, too. I was not scared. Pinky, be careful. Are you scared now? No, get away from there. Pinky, don't! Scared now? Pinky! Pinky! Are you scared now? Yes, Pinky, please! That was the meanest, dumbest, stupidest thing ever! Hey, where you going? Joleen-- Wait, Joleen! I was only kidding! Joleen-- Hey, I thought you'd think it was cool. Well, I didn't. What's the matter? You shouldn'ta done that. It was dangerous and it was mean. I'm sorry. Ah... I guess living here would drive anyone nuts. I have a present for you. Hold out your hand. It was my dad's. Pinky, you shouldn't-- You're worth it. I know it isn't a girl thing, but it's pretty-- look at it. It's very cool. Is your dad in the Army? No, he's dead. I'm sorry. I gotta go. If my dad gets back before I do, he'll kill me. I'm off to see the king! Can I go, too? Will it be fun there? Oh, yeah, you're going to have a good time. Do they have a TV? Yeah, a big color set. Can I get ice cream? Sure, anything you want. You just wait in here for me, okay? I'll be right back. Will you keep an eye on her? Sure. You were supposed to be looking after her, Amy. I was looking after her. Then where is she? I don't know. Shit. Where the fuck were you? I was at the pool. Don't you lie to me. You were with Jimmy Reed! Wait, what happened? Agnes Reed is dead, young lady. She can wait! For once do exactly what I tell you. Sit in this chair and you're not gonna--look at me. You're not gonna wander away. You're not gonna see anyone. You're not even gonna look out the window. Is that clear? Is that clear? Yes. Good. I hate him. I hate him-- everything is so fucked! I almost get raped by a guy I trusted, and the guy turns out to be a killer. He killed his mother! And dad... I could have died and he wouldn't have noticed. He just doesn't understand me at all. Life is just totally unfair. If it hadn't been for Pinky... He's really sweet, and he lives out here in Siberia where I'll probably never got to see him again. Dad won't even let me go outside, so I might possibly get to say at least goodbye to him. So you think it was, like, an accident? Well, not unless a fan can fly. A-ha. I'll be damned. Duckett, I'm going to need to secure this place until our boys from the lab come up and dust it. I'm shy a few people. How'd you like to be a deputy? Does that mean I'm not a suspect? Oh, shoot. Okay, Bill. No one gets in here without your say-so. I'm ready. I don't know why you didn't just bring the gas to the car. Because I'm a fuckup, all right? Get off my back. Guys, it's like a furnace in here! Lighten up, Charlie, we're all on the same team here. Great. Sorry. I just don't think this trip with Jo was a good idea. So what are you gonna do, divorce her, too? I don't think that's legal. I'm a writer. I'm supposed to be so good with words. I don't know what to say to her anymore. Dear Pinky... We're leaving now. I wanted to talk to you in person, but my father is holding me prisoner in here, so I guess this note will have to convey my appreciation for what you did for me today. Ugh! Dear Pinky, thank you for helping me today. I know it took courage. I like you a lot and I know we will see each other again. * Oom, ooh ooh, oom pah, oom, ooh ooh, ooh pah! * * Oom, ooh ooh, oom pah! oom, ooh ooh, ooh pah! ** * We're her friends * So we should know * Today's her birthday * Happy birthday, Jo! * We've got some gas * And it's time to go * Let's leave this dump before we start to glow! * * It's time to go... Ew! It smells like gasoline all over this place! Smells like perfume to me. Must be flooded. Give it a rest. Psst! Hey, Pinky! Come here! Hey! What's up with you? I thought you liked me. I do like you. So why are you leaving? It's not my fault. I mean, my dad, he wouldn't even let me say goodbye to you. No. What? I won't say goodbye. Oh, come on. Don't-- Wait, wait! Aw, shit. Jo, come on. Gimme a hand in here. Thank you, Jesus. Let's go. L.A. or bust. I can't find my journal. It's probably in the car. I'll take the back seat. It's too cramped. You'll be a mutant by the time we get to California. If you guys are gonna bullshit all night, I'm leaving without you. Nice language. Jo, come on. I'm not leaving without it. Amy! Daddy... Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy! It's okay. I'm here. It's okay. It's okay. I'm here. Having a party, pink face? You're in a lot of trouble. They're looking for you. Well, they're not gonna find me. I'm gone, man. I'm outta here. They can take this town and shove it up their asses. I need your help. Reach out and touch someone else. Listen to me. You are sick, and you always have been, so don't fuck with me! Just do what I say. Hey, buddy. What you got for me this time? Fan motor to mom's air conditioner. She didn't get the lifetime guarantee. Can you fix it? I don't know. I'll give it a look. Looks like a screw missing. Blades are all bent up. Don't screw around with that thing, Pink. Hi. Can I use the phone in the office? You can't go in there. It's a secured area. Pink, turn that damn thing back where I told ya. Come on, it's really important. Okay, but be quick and don't touch any evidence. Thanks. I owe you one. Okay, I'll tell you what then. Keep an eye on things for a minute. I'll be right back. All right. Let's go take a look at the unit.
