Subtitles by explosiveskull That's me, yours truly. And this is where I work. A beautiful office. And that's me in Iceland filming for an Extra ten days because of the damn volcano. Uh, there's me in Venezuela. And that's me in... ...that's gotta be New Jersey. What the hell's that doin' there? You're doing some work over there? 'Cause for a second it sounded like you were doing some work. Oh there's Jimmy. Jimmy is really angry because he has to fly all the way to South Dakota tonight with his tiny little computer. Does that actually work? It's Jim, not Jimmy. I don't know why you all keep adding Y to the end of my name. Jimmy, you have the schedule? What does it look like I'm doing, Lizzy? Alright, where's your Halloween spirit, guys? And this is our know-it- all assistant director, Liz, the pain in the ass-sistant. Very funny. What do you got there, smart-ass Tom? A new toy, a new toy. Is that the new camera you were talking about? - You know it. - Let me see. Hey hey, be careful! When'd you get it? A few days ago. Just testing it out. Oh, yeah? What have you shot so far? Uh, you know, not much. Just, you know, enough to know that it works. - Oh, yeah? Let me see. - Wait! Non wait! You go, cowboy. Get over here, cowgirl. You're out of control. Ah! All right, give it here. You go, Tommy... cowboy. You know what, Liz? You-you-you play too much. Not a word! - Hey Tommy, what's up? - What's up, Dan? Hey Pesce, lets talk about that... ...thing later. Hello, ladies. What do we have here? Some video, supposedly from China. Don't film me Tommy, I'm a mess. Okay. You better erase that footage. I'll think about it. Mike pretending to do some work. Tommy, dude there is this awesome, awesome party later. It's not a party if you're the only one there, buddy. Hi. May I have some privacy, please? You know, in some cultures it's traditional to knock. Hey, we have a new nickname for you around the office, Mr. Smiles! Tommy is scared of Karen. She's his boss. Okay, um, I'll call you once we arrive. Make sure you tell Simon to bring additional battery packs. Right. You have no idea how much shit that situation caused us last time. Did you get a chance to read my treatment for the show idea that I had? Uh, I feel it needs more structure. I mean, I could potentially take it to Nolan, but you have to punch it up. Come up with some scenarios. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing, I wanted it to be as spontaneous as possible. You know sometimes when you over-plan something, you kind of... The greatest moments, they kind of- they kind of disappear. I just feel like... Take it from someone who's been in reality television for some time. Structure is substance or your friends if you wanna make those sales. One man, one camera concept just isn't enough. What's this? Very cool camera. Yeah, it's not even released yet. I mentioned I was from Nolan Productions and they hooked me up. So, how is it? Oh, it's amazing. It's... The handling is incredible, it's amazing in low light. Um, I figure I'll test it out a little bit more and maybe recommend it for Kris' show. I think it'd be great. Where are you going again? Catskills, it's a couple hours up north. Uh, just me and a college buddy. There's nothing but tents and woods this year. That's creepy. Karen, isn't it a little unfair that we will be working three more days than Tommy? I am also scouting locations for Kris' show. Yeah, right. Kris is not going upstate. Well, whatever works, right? I'll see you in Dakota in three days. You got it. Give me that. You have to stop sucking up to her, man. Little Asian babies, is that what you want? This thing's incredible. - Tommy. - Yeah. I met this chick on the train... - No, you didn't. - Yeah, I did. No, you didn't. So, anyways, like I was saying, dude, I said, "Yeah?" and she was like, "Yeah." And I was like, "Yes!" Sounds like an intelligent conversation. Is it-is it difficult to get the girls to come into your basement to play Dungeons and Dragons? Um, yes... it is. But I got these pills, dude, you just crush up and slip in their drink when they're... How have you not been arrested? What? How have you not been arrested? I've been arrested. Check it out. It's so light, man. It was inspired by my idea. I sent the concept to a designer in Germany. - Sweet. - Right? You have a wild imagination, bro. Are you taking this with you? Yeah. Are you taking me with you? No. Always late. There she is... finally. I got it, don't worry. What? You think, I'm gonna help and get this baby towed? Oh, yeah, no, not this chick magnet. Hey, it worked on you. Filming already? I see, huh. Of course. You're carrying everything when we get there, okay? It's not gonna happen. Oh, but it is. Like, that face gives it all away. No, I'm sure, I'm sure, Mr. Innocent over here. - Hey! - You know, I can just imagine... I bet you talk about about... Ugh, you're such a pig! And, action. Come on! I said action. Oh, you're being shy now? You weren't that shy last night. Oh, you know me. Only when I have my lucky boxers on. Oh no, please, not those. I had nightmares about those all night long. I have to get rid of them. Y-you did erase it, right? - Yeah. Of course! - Right? Yeah, you better. Okay, so, since you don't want to talk, I will make the introductions. We are talking to Mr. Thomas Rivas, a video journalist and a producer of a new highly acclaimed reality series, Kris the Adventure Man, or Guy or something. An associate producer, actually. All right, shut up, Tommy. And here to my right, we have Ms. Monica Tanner. My girl of a year and a half. Um, a graduate business student, an aspiring actor, and a pretty good belly dancer on weekends. Shut up, I took one class. Keep your eye on the road, okay? The show's not dumb, all right? Its real life adventures. Danger. Survival. Please, please. You know I'm not buying ad time from you, so, please. By the way, did you talk to Karen about your new show concept? No not yet. Take this for a sec. Hey, bud. Yeah, yeah, we're close. How about that snow, man? Is he with Rachel? No. Sam. I told you. Come on. How many women does he have, Exactly? What do you mean? You know Sam. Oh yeah, I know Sam, Rachel and, um, oh yeah, Gloria too. Gloria is just a friend of his. Okay, a friend with benefits, maybe. Uh, whatever works. Whoa, Excuse me. You better not have any friends like that. Uh, what's that face for? - I'm just kidding. - Yeah. We're gonna freeze. I love it out here. Oh, shit! Who is that sExy mechanic? What? Seriously? You're gonna do this now? I'm a documentary filmmaker. This is in my blood. My instinct. No, get your ass over here right now. Let's go. All right, all right, all right, all right. Be gentle. Report to us, Thomas. Uh, at approximately 17:09, um, the car suddenly jerked and it appears as though we've hit something. Right, and you screamed like a little girl. For the record, that never happened. And now we're examining the tire to make sure all is well. I can actually breathe up here. The air is so much cleaner than in the city. I can't believe it snowed in October. Since when does that happen? I think we hit a rock or something. There's a scratch here. Babe, you see that? Babe... There's-there's some kid over there. He was just... There was just a boy standing over there by the tree staring at us. I don't know, maybe he was lost or something. That's so bizarre. Lost, out here? I don't know. He was there, now he's not. Uh... Hey! Anybody there? Come on, we gotta go. Ex is gonna bitch. Look, I'm telling you there's a little boy out there. All right, well, he's not here now. Come on, we gotta get moving. All right. Let's hit the road. And we're off... again. Sounds okay. Is your seat belt buckled? Yup. I hate living in the city. Oh... There he is freaking out. Look at that outfit. Oh, he looks so mad. What is he wearing? Sorry we're late. And his impatience is limitless. What, you don't know how to use your cell phone, man? I been standing out here for over an hour freezing my balls off. Oh, you mean your ball? Your secret is out, my friend. - What are you, a comedian now? - You miss it? What is this, dude? This, my friend, is his new toy. Hi, how are you? - Good to see you. - You, too. - Hey, Sam. - Hey, how you doing? You don't get enough of this shit at work, man? Never, man. I-I don't see any snow. I'm telling you it was snowing. It was totally snowing. You didn't see any snow because it's not gonna snow. It's not going to snow. And you are dressed perfectly for the occasion for filming your first Banana Republic... - Oh, let me see! - Will you turn that off? - Congratulations. - Oh, Jesus. Yes, camping. Absolutely. All right, all right. You know what? You're jealous. There's nothing you can do about it. I'll be jealous when you freeze to death. Ex has been so busy... - Right, I been busy. - What have you been busy at, Ex? Busy, just busy. You know, yup. Nature's calling, one second. Come here, man. What are you, married man now? She got the cuffs on you now? No, not even close. How's everything going with Sammy? How am I not supposed to make you look like an asshole when you keep switching around with girls? You're not supposed to not do anything. Just don't worry about it. Rachel couldn't make it so Sam's here. Rachel couldn't make it. Scheduling conflict? Shh! Yeah, Exactly. It doesn't matter where we are. This is all about being, you know, outdoors. - Being men. - Being men outdoors. It's not like, you know... I been fishing up here before but it was a different spot. - This is supposed to be better. - Uh-huh. - It's by a lake right? - Yeah. Should of bought warmer boots. Whatever, man, I'm hiking in sneakers. Yeah, I saw those, those are very nice. So what are those, Italian? Did you buy the real ones or did you get the fake ones on eBay again? Listen man, if you wont put that camera away, I gotta look good for you. Don't you think? You're gonna have a lot of fun cleaning the mud off your shoes later. Aha! Snow! Whatever, man, don't pay any attention to the snow. No, but its there, though, you can't deny it. It's white and powdery. There is no snow. I don't see any snow. It's not gonna snow. It's not gonna snow. Stop talking about it. Stop giving it attention. It's not going to snow. But it did. The point is it did. - Already happened. - I don't see any snow. Uh huh. - All right. - Whatever. We're being one with nature, right Ex? Absolutely, absolutely. With our Italian loafers. So Ex, you getting tired of the whole Wall Street game yet? Burning other people's money, etcetera. - I am. - Hey, whatever. I'm a proud capitalist, so sue me. But you better not, because my lawyer will crush you. I have got the most brilliant idea for a new show. What is it? One Brooks Brother suit, a cigar, and a glass of brandy. Now that sounds like a show I would love to watch. All right, here we are at the campsite. As you can see, my beautiful lady, Monica, has set up a lovely tent right behind me. That's camera one, and if we switch over to camera two, we can clearly see that they are having a little bit of difficulty. I'm pretty sure he got it free with his shoes on eBay. Um, and clearly the winner of the tenting contest is my beautiful lady, Ms. Monica Tanner. Monica, baby, smile for the camera. Dear, you know what? I got it. I'm good. You're doing an amazing job. I don't need your help at all. Thank you, nice. I love you. And I also started the fire. Yeah, I think it needs a little bit more wood there. Keeping us warm here. Look at that churning gorgeous. How we doing over here guys? You're gonna pull it out of that thing again. Can you slow down? Hi! We're doing fine. - Tent setup going okay? - Yeah. This is the tent. This is the tent she said she had. This is the tent when she told me not to bring one th-that she had. Sam, was it his prowess in the wilderness that attracted you to him initially? Oh, it's all his charm. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy... It's all his charm. Go make your gay, little woodland creature movie over there, okay? Can you do me a favor, please? I'm trying to shove a stick into this because I'm missing a rod. All right, all right. Back to-back to the lovely Monica. Thomas, Thomas, could you please come help me with the sleeping bags or just something? All right, all right, I'm coming. I'm coming. Where... Oh, man. Tommy. - Did you just... - Hey, Tommy. Did you just see that? I just... Did you just... Hey, what happened? Did you guys just... Dude, something just... Like a flash of light and then it was gone. - Damnit! - What was it? What did it look like? I-I don't know because someone made me put my camera down. Oh, please. Don't tell me you been eating mushrooms again like in Orlando, dude, 'cause I can't babysit you tonight. Dude, whatever. All right, whatever. Hey. Let's go back to the campfire. Hot dogs are ready, beer is cold. Come on, we still have stuff to set up. All right, I'll leave my camera on later just in case, all right? So, deal with it. Yeah. Hey, buddy, how come you never told me about 'shrooms? I... What? All right, so what are you scared of, again? The three S's. Tell me the three S's. Man, sharks, spiders and scorpions. I don't know why I would go where any of them are. I know there can be some spiders out here, but, uh... I think there are sharks out here, actually. I don't think I'm gonna see a shark out here. - I think you might. - I don't think I'm a see a man-eating shark out here. The Long Island Sound, you never know. You never know, that's all I'm saying. How many beers have you had? Yeah, plenty. Wait, is that rolling again? Yup. Come on, what is it with you and that thing, man? I... You'll be great to laugh at later. - Yeah, yeah. - I gotta put my makeup on. Film yourself naked if you want something to laugh at. Oh, you're a fire tonight, buddy. Can I tell him? Come on. Please. You guys, Tommy is pitching his own show. That's what this is all about. This is for his reel. We're an Experiment right now. Oh, your own show. You're growing up. - Well, what's it about. - You're looking for fame? No, its not even like that. Oh, its not even like that... My ass, it's not. Hot shot. It is a reality show. One-man survival-type thing. But hasn't that sort of been done before? Yes, but not like this. It'll be one host with a single camera point of view. Yeah, and that's the tagline. One man one camera. Just kind of exactly like the show you work on right now. It's not even made yet. All right? It's an idea. I don't even know why we are talking about it. I know why we're talking about it. I mean, you know... Just... you know... Be nice for you to have success somewhere along the way. You know what I mean? You are such an asshole. Just keep trying, keep trying, keep trying, man, that's all. You are such an asshole. Why do you always have to rag on what he's trying to do? Hey, hey, why do you always have to rag on what I'm trying to do? I'm just playing around with him. He's my best friend. You're not mad... See, he's not mad. He knows, ever since I was a little kid, I would speak my mind. Yeah, he doesn't give me a choice. Yeah, your mind is too big for us to handle. Oh yeah, like some other things I could mention. - Oh no, please don't. - Whatever. Whatever! Well anyways, so, I watched that show. That Kris adventure show, you-you work on. Uh huh? Really gotta be honest, man, it's a little difficult to-to get through. Yeah, well, that's the point. That's why it's flawed. That's why I told you I was working on a completely different concept. You're not even listening to me. I'm listening. I'm listening, different concept. Different concept, but what I'm saying I guess, you know... You do not need that beer. You drink it. You drink it. Just because-just because you get a camera doesn't make you a filmmaker all of a sudden, man. If that were the case, I'd be Michael Bay right now. You know what I mean? Just like... - You would be Michael Bay. - I would. This is a megapixel phone camera and I'll be like Brett freakin' Ratner. You know? Steven freakin' Spielberg. - Wow, you're so supportive. - George Luc-ass. Shut up! Amazing. Look at this kid. - This is your best friend. - I'm playing around. I'm worried about those spiders out here. What about scorpions? Eat sharks. I'm playing with you, man. I'm playing with you. - He's just joking. - Come on, sweetie. Turn it on. Is it on? - Turn it on. Is it on? - Yeah. Go. It's on? Okay. Oh! Ex, dude! Do I still have my eyebrows? You're good. You're good. I'm the king of this jungle! I have to put you on America's Dumbest Imbecile Moron. Oh, you should do that, do that, you should do that. Oh no, get a close up of this baby. Oh, that's a great idea. This is that-this is that uh.... Wait, wait, wait. Set it up for me. What are we looking at? This is that 24-year malt. The premium $400 dollars a pop. - How much is it? - $400 a pop. - How much? - $400 a pop. Here we go again. It is! I got a whole case of this sent to my office this week, uh, and people collect these. - Congratulations. - Stop showing off. Yeah, because I was involved in some relatively lucrative and successful real estate deal and so they, uh, sent to me as a reward. You are such a little liar. As a reward for a successful real estate deal. You're such a little liar, Ex. Uh oh, elaborate, Sam. He's lying. His father got him the booze. He sent it to him. So stop talking out of your ass. - What? - A little gift from daddy? Yeah, a little gift from daddy. You don't know what you're talking about. I heard you on the phone last night. No. Your father sent you the booze. Stop talking. You're a liar, and its snowing so you're wrong on top of it, buddy. Busted! What is that white stuff? You need to think before you speak. Double whammy. You need to think before you speak. - I'm just saying what I heard. - All right, all right. You need to think before you speak. Don't raise your voice at me. I'm not raising my voice at you, but if I wanna raise my voice at you, I'll raise my voice at you. - Ex, Ex. - You're an alcoholic, babe. - Oh Oh. - Oh, I'm an alcoholic. Yeah, you can dish it out but can't it in, huh? I'm an alcoholic that pays your father's medical bills. - Oh, boy. - Okay, Ex. What? No, tell 'em. Tommy. Tell 'em. Tell 'em. I pay your father's medical bills because your broke, fake modeling career doesn't make you enough money to do it. Really, dude? - Sammy.. - Sam... What? Yeah, storm off, storm off. Ex, give me this. Give me this Storm off, storm off. Dude, you did it to yourself, man. Turn that off, dude. I said turn it off! She know's you didn't mean it, all right. You just gotta talk to her. Talk to her, okay? I just keep blowing it with her, man. I know, I know. Listen, you gotta... You know, I didn't mean what I said back at the rest stop. You know, I was trying to brush it off. But I think she like me too, man. She's such a great girl. She wouldn't be putting up with all your bullshit if she didn't. I know I been putting up with your bullshit my entire life. All right, look, you can't- you can't say shit like that to her in front of people. What would you do, huh? I would probably do the same thing. The same thing. Exactly. Exactly, right? - Sorry, man. - It's all right. - I'm sorry, man. - It's okay. It happens. Yeah? - I wanna go to bed, man. - Good idea. Take care of Sam, yeah? - Oh, Tommy... - Yeah? You were right about the snow. - I love you man. - I love you, too. All right, go pass out. Go pass out. Tell Monica, you know... ...that I love her, dude. She knows, she knows. All right, man. Were you filming the whole time? Yup. I sure was. You are out of control. - I'm the filmmaker, now, mister. - Not cool, not cool. I love you, man. So, it's, uh, one am on this beautiful snow-filled morning and we're witnessing another super-battle between Ex and Sammy. I think they're going for a record. Most fights possible in a 24-hour period by two human beings. I can't believe we're snowed in. I know, it's nice, though. - Yeah, I guess. - Yeah. No service up here. Ugh, put that thing away, will you? That's why we came out here, to get rid of it. Oh my god, what's wrong with them? This is pretty normal. They need counseling and we need some sleep. Who needs sleep? Isn't-isn't that enough filming for one day? - No. - Could we just be done with the camera? No, I might- I might miss something. I have to film every moment. What are you possibly gonna miss? 'Cause you know what happens? The best things always happen and then I'm not filming. Either that, or I don't write it down. - It's one of two things. - Okay. And I either forget it... This way, if I'm filming everything, then there's nothing I'm going to miss. You saw that jackass spitting on that fire. We never want to miss that. Oh god, what now? Oh, you're going outside? You're going outside? You're going outside the tent? You're going outside. You're going outside. - Leave me the hell alone. - I need your- I need your body heat in here, you know that's how this works. Otherwise you'll be cold and I'll be cold, that's two people that'll be cold. I swear to god, if you don't leave me alone, I'm walking to the car. Leave me alone right now. You're gonna sleep in the snow? Yeah, I'm gonna sleep in the snow. You're gonna sleep in the snow. You know what? Fine. Freeze out here. See if I give a shit. Unbelievable. I'm so tired of this bullshit. That looks like its over. Yeah, should I go talk to her? No, just let her be. - You sure? - Check on her tomorrow. Okay. The constant steady stream of bullshit. - That's nice. - Yeah, I know. Hey. What? Camera off. - Fine. - Yeah. Monica, wake up. - What is that? - I don't know. Tommy, what is that? Is that Sam? Sam! - Stay quiet. - Sam! - Tommy! - Sam! - Tommy! - Stay back. Sam! Baby?! Tommy, what's happening? Tommy?! Sam? Sam! Sam! - Is she okay? - It's okay. Sam baby, please wake up. What is that, Tommy? What is that, man? - Yes, what is that light? - Do you hear that? - Sam. - It's still here. Sam? Sammy? Sam. You guys, come back over here. - I gotta get this. - Can you hear me? Whoa, we'll be right back, all right? We'll be right back. - Just stay put. - Tommy! Are you sure you don't want to stay with Sam? No man, I gotta see this. Did you see that? It was huge. You see where it... This way, this way! Come this way. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, get up. - Wait up! - Come on. - Where did it go? - I can't tell. What is that? - What is that? - Go, go! Ex, wait. There is no escape... There is no escape... Hello? There is no escape... Uh... - Who are you boys? - I don't know what it was! It flew right over the road! Where you boys staying? What's up with your radio, man? I don't know. I'm going to find out and we're gonna get help. All right? Calm down. Come on, we gotta go, man! We gotta see this thing! This is close to what this is. Let's see what this is. Hey, hey, hold on! Come on, lets go check it out. You stay here with the truck. Be careful, man! Be careful! Looks like it's that way. Hey, hey, slow down, I said. Stay back, behind me. Radio is completely dead. Damn it. I was driving along and it flew right over me. Where the hell did it go? It went down. It had to. It's on the ground? I don't think we should go up there. My uncle told me about craft that landed here years ago. Everyone around here knows what I'm talking about. Phil, Phil shut up! A lot of illness. A lot of unexplained deaths. It's close. - I feel strange. - Me too. Do you feel that, Tommy? Hear that? What is that? Oh my god. Oh, man, whoa. What is that? There is no escape... Do you see that? Guys, look! Oh my god. What the hell? What was... Tommy... What's going on, man? Oh my god. Ex, oh my god. Tommy! Tommy! What's going on, dude? Keep your guards up. You guys hear that? Oh, my god! Oh, oh! Ex! Ex! Ex! Sam, Sam, Sam? Sam. Sam? - Tommy! - Sam. Monica. Are you okay? Why did you leave me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Tell me what happened. Where's Ex? Sam. How long has she been like this? Since you left. She was mumbling at first and she got quiet and now she doesn't say anything. There's more. What? She has these marks. They're all- they're all over her skin. I mean, look. She has them on her chest. Tommy, why aren't you telling me what happened? What did you see out there? Please tell me! I have to show you what I filmed. Why are you still filming? We gotta get to the car. We gotta start moving. What about Ex? Grab me my vest. Get your phone. - Tommy, what about Ex? - I don't know. I think Ex is gone. Check your phone. We have no service here. I already told you that. I want you to make sure. Stop it, Tommy. Stop asking me shit for no reason. We need to figure something out. What do you think I'm trying to do? I'm sorry. We gotta get back to the car. We-we-we gotta find the trail. We get back to the rest area and get some help, okay? Okay? Sam? Sam? - Sam! - Where did she go? Sam! Sammy! Sam, can you hear me? You were looking right at her. You telling me you didn't see what direction she went in? I wasn't looking right at her. You had me check my phone, remember? Sam! I can't see anything out here. Sammy! Tommy, how did this happen? You were right there, you were filming. How did you not see her? Calm, calm down. I just can't calm down. She's out here. Tommy, she's out here by herself. - Sammy! - Sam! What is that? I can't tell where it is. We should go back to the camp. What about Sam? We just can't leaver her here. Tommy. Be absolutely still. Come on. Get up, get up. Faster, faster. I'm trying. Come on, get up. - Do you see that? - Yeah. Yeah. We'll walk slowly. Are you sure we should keep going? We have to. It's the only path. Tommy, I'm scared. Just be careful. Stay quiet. Okay. - Oh my god, it's Sam. - What? It's Sam. What is she doing? Tommy, she's just sitting there. Tommy, what's happening to her? Sam! Go! Shh. Did you see her? Shh. Did you see her, Tommy? Stay close to me. I don't think I can do this. We have to go back. We missed the turn. We have to go back. No, we didn't miss any turns. We didn't miss any turns. Please, baby, It's just a few minutes back, I'm telling you. Ugh, this is useless, come on. Help me light the map. What is that? - Stay close to me. Run! - Tommy! - Monica! - Tommy! - Keep going! - Tommy, wait! - Don't stop! - Tommy! Tommy! Tommy. Tommy! Tommy! Shh. Shit. You think we missed the turn? No. We should keep going. I'm so tired. Babe... We gotta get out of here. There's gotta be a way out. God, this looks familiar. That rest stop, it can't be far from this. We keep heading east. I don't see how we can't still be at the same spot. Tommy. Tommy, can we just sit for a second? - Please? - You okay? - Yeah. - Sit. I'm a get us out of here, okay? - I'm so scared. - I know, I know. I feel like we just keep going in circles. I know Exactly where we are. We just have to keep heading southeast. And we're going to find a town or a road or something, okay? Okay. Did you see it? Yeah. Sam. I can't get that out of my head. I know, but you can't think about that right now, okay? - It could have been one of us. - I know, I know. But you can't think about that right now. All right? We just have to get out of here. - Okay. Lets focus on that, okay? - Okay. Let's focus on getting safe and get out of here okay. Why are you still filming? It's the only evidence that we have that something happened here tonight. I gotta keep filming, okay? I gotta. Tommy. Yeah? Promise me we'll make it through this. I don't think it's ever gonna stop. I don't know where it's coming from. Tommy, come on. We gotta get out of here. - No no, don't move. - Come on. It's not safe here. Tommy! It's coming from over here. - Tommy, let's go. - Monica! We can't be here. Tommy. Monica! Over here! Monica! Monica! Monica! Monica. I can't go back. I can't go back. I can't go back. I can't go back. I can't go back. I can't go back. Baby. I can't go back. I can't go back. I can't go... I don't know what to do. Ex? Ex. Oh... Oh, Tommy. Ex, thank god. I filmed this, man. No! No! Help me! Help me! Please, god! No! Ah, no! I don't know.. I think there's some kind of, like, shield. Shield? Like a force or something, 'cause... ...I was walking, must have been four miles north of here and all of a sudden, I was back on the trail next to you. It doesn't make any sense. It's impossible. I thought I lost you, man. I thought I lost you too, man. It's so cold. We were heading south. I got separated. Sam? Sorry, man. Sorry. We're trapped. It's looking for us. Monica. Oh my god, I gotta find Monica. - We got separated. We... - Tommy. - The thing came at us.. - You gotta forget about Monica. - You gotta forget about her. - I can't forget about her! I'm not you! Right. Just... What are we gonna do? I can't believe this. I-I saw another ship, man. This disk high in the sky. I don't know what these things are. Ex. What? You see that? It's a house. Maybe there's a landline. Right behind you. It looks abandoned. I'm going to check upstairs. Okay. Be careful. Hey, Tommy! Dude, look what I found. It's loaded. What is that smell? Holy shit. It says here he found it back in May. There was a storm in the evening and... ...a loud crash and then the Earth shook. He went to investigate and found it. It was still alive when he found it. He brought it back here. It's all these theories here, like... ...an alien base, government conspiracy. This guy must have been obsessed. Whoever discovered this did an autopsy. What is his name? Dr. Charles Roy. It must be him. That corpse... Yeah? It's-it's much smaller than the thing that attacked us, right? Like it's a... completely different species. There is another one. I saw a smaller one near the crash site, remember? I see they wrote an article about him here. What does it say? Says he's a medical researcher. Why wouldn't he report any of this? I Guess he thought no one would believe him. Charles Roy. "Day three. The visitor seems to be recovering. He is not eating the food I have provided for him. However, he drank the boiled water." Look at this. It's May 20th. The visitor is... ...not talking to me verbally. But... ...I'm able to fully understand him. Or it, rather, I... I'm not sure of its gender. The visitor is behaving... erratically. It's uh, its still weak... ...but... ...it's sending mixed signals. I think it's trying to deceive me. The visitor does not want to be filmed. It's dying. I think I am... ...able to figure out its intentions. They're not here to befriend us. No shit, Charles. Oh. Oh, man. Oh! Ugh. The body cavity is filled with a strange dark liquid. It's not hemoglobin its more like hemocyanin. It's, like, so viscous. I can't even... wash it off my skin. I placed the body in the refrigerator for preservation. I'm not feeling well. I'm unable to move freely. I have insomnia. These are like... strange-pigmented... ...or what. ...Lesions. Now, no... ...on my arms... Can't even... ...walk up a hundred feet away from the house. I always end up here. Is that it? That's the last video entry. Okay... All right. What do you think this means? I mean, what is this? Like, an invasion? Wouldn't they go for the populated areas first, you know, take over the cities? I mean... maybe they're, uh... ...still examining us, collecting data. What are we gonna do? We have to do something. We can't just let them do this to us. - We just can't sit here, Tommy! - Shh, quiet down. Charles. Charles, is that you? Tommy, don't get too close to him. Charles... I'm Tommy. This is Ex, we're from the city. - Something's really wrong with him, man. - Shh. We found your work here. Charles? Charles, what... Ex, what's wrong with him? Charles? I need you to talk to me. I need you to tell me what's happening here. We've seen... Tommy, this is a waste of time, man. He's sick, look at him. Have you seen them, yet? We've seen a lot of things we can't understand. I have been listening. Listening... Listening. All right, listening to what? Why didn't you report this, man? Why didn't you report this to someone? Ex, relax. They won't let you... He's cracking up, man. Oh... oh... Something's really wrong with him, man. Charles, Charles, are you... Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Oh, man. Oh, man. Is that... What is that, Charles? What are you doing? What the hell? This helps me. We can... lock him down there, you know. I don't want him to hear us. No man, I don't know. Just... keep your distance... all right? Tommy, what are we going to do? I don't know. - Charles? - Charles? Careful, Tom. Charles? Careful. Charles? Whoa. I don't know, man. - Charles? - Charles? Whoa. Charles, what are you doing? - Charles, why are you... - Charles? Charles? Charles? Charles?! - Put the hook down, Charles. - Charles, wait! - Charles?! - Charles! Stop! - Tommy, get out of there! - Shit! Oh my god. Oh my god. Ex... Oh my god. We gotta go now! Now! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Ex! Ex! We gotta do something. All right. On the count of three, - let go of the door. - Okay! Okay? Okay. One... two... three... Three! Tommy, where you going, man? Listen to me, I think we head in this direction, all right, and stay quiet. No man, no, I say we stay here. Why do you want to go back? Stay here, man? There's something inside. - We don't know what it is. - Tommy! This house is the safest place we'vebeen to. I'm not going out there! Listen to me. I don't have a good feeling about this, all right? - A good feeling?! - I don't want to get trapped in there. Bullshit! You just want to go back so you can find Monica. Well, she's dead! Don't say that shit. Well, it's either that or so you can keep filming. - Shh. - Documenting this is not worth dying for! Listen to me. If I don't keep filming this, no one is going to know what happened here. Well, good luck getting it on the five o'clock news. Oh god. Oh god. I don't see it anymore, man. I think it's gone. Come on. I can't do this, Tommy. I can't do this anymore. - I can't. - Ex. - Ex. Ex! - I'm done. Ex, come on. You hear me, sons of bitches?! I'm done! Ex, what's happening to you, man. I don't know. I don't know. Listen, listen, listen. I know we both been through a lot, all right? These last few hours have been the most confusing in my life but... ...we gotta keep it together, all right? It's five am. We're located in the Catskill Park region of upstate New York. A few hours ago, we encountered an alien presence. We lost two members of our team. This thing... ...whatever it is... ...doesn't want us to leave this place. I never believed in any of this stuff. Not really. Even now, it seems like it should be taking place inside of a dream. Well, it's not. You filming yourself again, Tommy? Documenting reality? What reality is that? That the reality is gonna make you famous? It's going to make you known? I lost somebody! So did I. It's gonna be okay. No, it isn't. They're never gonna let us out of here, Tommy. They're never gonna let us out of here. Ex. Ex. Ex. Ex! Come on, man. Ex, come one! Where you going? Ex. Ex? We're in this together, man. Ex, what are you doing? Ex. Ex, it's me. Take it easy. Ex, Ex. Ex. What did she look like? Sam. What did she look like when she died? What did she look like?! Ex, don't let them get to your head, man. Don't let them get into your head. It's me. It's me. No! I know... I know... I know. I know. You okay? You're okay. Come on. Come on. You're okay. Okay. Did you hear that? What happened? What was that? You didn't hear that, did you? - Hear what? - I swear.. - What? - I heard- I think I did... - Monica's voice. - No. - I swear. - No. It's impossible. - How do you know? - Because I know. I s... I swear I heard... Monica! Monica! Tommy! - Monica! - Tommy. I swear I heard her this time. Dude, Tommy, stop screaming. Don't scream. Monica. I heard her. I gotta go find her. What? No, Tommy, no. It doesn't matter anymore. - What? - It doesn't matter! - Monica! - Tommy. Tommy! - Monica, I'm coming! - Tommy, wait. Tommy, come back. Come back! Come back! Monica, where are you?! Tommy! Monica, Monica! I hear her. Monica. Monica! I taste blood. I've fired a shotgun before... ...Shooting range. When I was a kid, I was with you. Ugh, it's so blurry. I keep trying to remember... ...things from my past. I-I gotta get out of here. Monica? Monica. Monica. Monica. Baby. Baby. You're okay. You're doing good. You're going to be okay. I got you. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, baby. Please, please, please. Come on. Baby, baby, bay... You'll be... You'll be. You'll be okay. Come on, you'll be okay. Yeah, come on. Yeah, come on. Come on. I'm gonna get us out. We'll make it out, baby, come on. We're safe. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay! No. No! No! No! No! No! Tommy? Tommy, they'll find you. Baby. I love you. M... Monica? Monica? There is no escape... There is no escape. There is no escape... - Stop. - They're coming. Hey! Hey! Stop! Where are you going?! Stop walking! Hey! Listen to me! Ah. Hey! Come on! You... want me?! You want me?! Come get me! Hey! I'm right here! Come on! Come on! Hello-hello? This is... ...This is Thomas Rivas calling for Nolan Productions in New York. Hello, I'm... I...
