My shoes are so tight. OK, I get it. The light please. Mayumi, let's go. Music please. I spin slowly... Zoom on my face... I undress... Zoom out please... Now the 8-8 please... Pink please... Could you spin please? Yes, right there. Got it. Darker now... Now I spin twice... And then you take off the filter. Wasn't the 8-8 better? Yes, absolutely. OK, sorry the 8-8. Alright, the 8-8. Good, this feels right. Fine, we'll do like this. -Good work. -Good work. -Thank you. -Thank you. Mayumi, Mayumi... Mika Madoka: Yubi o nurasu onna. Mayumi, Mayumi... Mayumi, Mayumi... Hope, hope, hope... Hope, hope, hope. Hope, hope, hope. Poster: Mayumi Hope, hope... Get in. It's Shun. Shit. Busy at work every single day. Shining under the spotlights for all those strangers. You and me both, through all this... have become patient angels. On the other hand, your mom... is an angel of impatience. You'll take care of him, right? He's my own blood. He's the uncle of the kid. Who is he? He's my light engineer at the club. Because you see, the father... as soon as he saw I was pregnant... disappeared into thin air. And now, I just have to wait for him. And when he comes back... You think you'd be so glad about it? I don't need hear your rant... I told you I'm waiting for him. I don't need you to pity me. He will come back... and we'll build ourselves a good home. And he will be good to me. What's taking him so long? He seems so attracted to me. You can't blame him for that. You attract them like bees around a honey-pot. Idiot. You see I'm suffering, you could at least comfort me. I can find loads of money to fulfill my dream. But then when I'll have money... I'd like to have only one dick in my life. That would be the dream. Why did you lie and tell him I'm your light engineer? Aren't you the dumb one. I have my own reasons to tell them what I want. We're going. We saw Shun when we left... but in fact he'd spend the night with you, right? You think so? I saw him come out of your place. And so what? So why did he avoid me? He told me to move the baby bed and stroller. Ask him yourself when he's back from his tour. He has to come back in a week. You see... you always say that I'm pathetic. What do you want? You're bringing me bad juju. You're surrounded by a big bubble of lies. Look who's talking. You and Shun... you made a deal, I'm sure. Tell me the truth. You guys made a deal about me. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. We don't have any deals. You can't lie to me. Come on tell me... tell me about the deal. I'd rather know... my body belongs to me alone. Mayumi, Mayumi. I heard you often come to see me at the club? Mayumi, Mayumi. I love it when they cheer you. Mayumi, Mayumi. They're simply encouraging me. Klimt's painting, "the Kiss"... Shun took it from your place. He said they are in a flower garden... and he kisses her as she kneels. They are in a flowered paradise... and he leans towards her. Isn't it so romantic? Sure is. Why does he think I look like her? He told you that, right? That I look like her. You were jerking off looking at her. Stop, you perv. I'm telling you to stop. You know I worship you as a goddess. And while you're on stage... I can't stop jerking it off, like this, like this. A goddess? You say such crude words to a goddess? What can I do, when I see you dance I'm too excited. Liar, you really believe I'm a goddess? And the man on that painting, is he Shun? Alright, gotta go. See you. He says he is that man on the painting kissing me? Even if he means it as a joke... I'm the woman he loves... but he too pities me. How can he throw me in your arms? How can Shun do that? He thinks I'm a burden in his life. Now I'm a single mom... working as a stripper. But still, you two made a deal, I know. Shun is away for a week on a tour... he told you to take me over? Is that right? Tell me? Don't think I'm a fool, you know I'm right. Don't surround me with lies. I truly love you... we have no such deal. You can't lie to me. You and me are a good match, you'd have a good deal in bed. You know what Shun told me... "When I'm away you can rely on Yuji for anything." Until today I would trust everything he told me. Now that he's gone and I'm so sad... Please stay the night. I'll do anything you ask... ask me anything. I'm the only one who suffers... I'm the only one who cries and drinks. Fine, I'll abide by your deal with Shun. Take me over. Do it like Shun. Do it like Shun. Shun. He must be very self-confident. Shun? He has that secret spell on you. Don't flatter him too much. But that's true though... more than a man... Shun is... my male. I have to go to work. What's wrong? I miss Shun so bad. Well, he's far now, there's just me. Shun won't come back. Sure, he will be back. You don't know about that. Neither you will come back. Of course I'll come back flying to you. Say it. I need you here. While Shun is away I need you, alright? You see... Tell me. I'll do exactly as Shun told me. You will. He's not living here anyway. He comes here on a whim. Indeed. So, I'll do the same. I have to go to work. Stay, stay. I'll do what Shun wants. Exactly as he said. I'll be your bodyguard while he's away. What am I to you? I like you. So why are you so hung up on him? You're the only one I can talk to about him. Is that right? Now, I have to go to work. You don't have to go to work. Then don't come back. Don't ever come back. Tonight I'll fly back to you. You don't have to, don't ever come back here. I don't want to see you ever again. Hello, Mr. Director? I should have called you before, it's Yuji. I'm really sorry but... I need the day off. You idiot... busy as we are... you'd better rush here now. I'm sorry... I have a fever and I'm so weak... please give me this day off. You are not that sick. I'll be there tomorrow. Thank you sir, I'm sorry. "You like that?" "Yes I like it." "I like it more and more." "Is it the first time you use that?" "Yes, first time." He was a reporter who studied at Tokyo University. Tokyo University? Right. He was an assiduous fan on my tours. He followed me all over Japan, Hokkaido to Okinawa. Okinawa. And he dropped off Tokyo University. He'd been after me for two years. The first time he came back stage... he was creepy. He asked if he could film me. He looked like a zombie. I see he's a better lover than me. He was amazing. "May I see your panties?" I'm cold. Are you up for it? I can't anymore. What a worthless man. I'm sorry. Come on... how many times have we been doing it today? Just let him cry. Poor kid. Ouch, don't. Do you do it that often with Shun too? You're always so annoying. I thought he had it all better. You want to be better? I want to show him that I did an excellent job. You think you're not up to him? What a worthless man. Hey, you don't want me anymore? Who's gonna take care of Kazuo? Pa, pa, pa, pa, be sexy. Far to the back, OK. Show your face, OK. Stand up, OK, OK. Now, Mayumi, to the right... Mind your hips... Then left... Now your feet, your feet, OK. Now show your emotions, OK. Shit. You can eat those. Eat them, eat them. Mayumi come here. Mayumi, get it? OK. Hey you, what are you doing here? You can't bring a baby here. I'm just doing what I'm told. This baby is her... Last weekend in the club in Shibuya... we sold all the tickets. You get it? She's one in a century, a cultural phenomenon. A world sensation, you get it? This is all for Mayumi, to her glory. She is a revolution... she's an idol, an idol. In universities she has fan-clubs... imagine, for a dancer. It would be a disaster if they knew she's a single mom. Who the hell are you? I'm Mayumi's production director. Just go now. She doesn't need a pimp. Consider her figure, her youthful body... she has only 2-3 years ahead... then she'll turn into a regular broad. And no one will want her on stage. I don't know why you're saying all that. You fucked her all night last night... and you're complaining? Yuji, just go to my place and pay the rent. Pay it yourself. You do it, I hate that creepy landlady. What's that about? Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me. May I help you? Ms. Kimio Tokunaga from Apt.102 is sending me... to pay her rent. Please wait a minute. Hey. It stinks. And don't disrespect Kimio. What? I hope you get it. Have a nice day. Shun. Shun. Shun. Shun, don't leave your woman alone. What is that? Don't leave me Shun. What are you crying about? What are you upset about? I didn't say I was upset. It's even worse when you forget. Since Shun thinks I'm a burden. But you can't get him out of your head. He wants to forget me. And so there is me. Look. Don't tell me that. Even I want to forget him. Tell you... I'm gonna lose my job. Just don't go to work. I don't want to go. I'm in paradise right now. So don't go. But it's hell at the same time... a hell of jealousy. Could buy some bred? Buy some milk too. You like your job, right? Why would I like it? A robot could do my job. It would just have to smile and bow. Thank you sir. Then find another job. It's everywhere the same. If I work 10 more days I'll have a bonus. How much is that bonus? About ¥180,000, I guess. That's good. Sure it's good. For me it's like a million. What kind of work do you do? I carry boxes. From here to there, and then from there to here. Let me show you. You're like a crab. Sure, like an idiot crab. You're tickling me. Don't go to work. I need to find some excuse for my boss. I'm going. Thank you for coming. I'm sorry. Watch out. Are you OK? Watch out. I'm sorry. Hey, but it's all your fault. Hey, apologize. Hey you, apologize. Apologize. You're completely crazy. People have no values anymore. Just pick it up. What if it's Shun? Hello. Shit. Who was it? Sometimes, I have silent calls. Shun is not calling at all. So, when Shun comes back... you two guys will kick me out. Why do you talk about that? I'm having a bath now... is that the place to talk about that? I don't need to hear your grief. Because I'm so well here... if you kick me out... You think your complaints help anything? I'm just expressing my feelings. Hey, how about you hop in too? It's still quite warm. And you're all sweaty. Hop in. -I'm fine thank you. -Just hop in. You'd better wash your baby. I'll do that later. You'd want to wash me instead? See, I'm not even your family. I love the woman who gave birth to you. After a bath, beer tastes even better. Your mom is offering me a beer in the morning. Quick, I'm waiting. You want to go to work, right? Because of the bonus... it's ¥180,000. Just go then if you don't wanna stay. It's fine, just go. Shun was nicer than you. Every time I was feeling down... he would stay by my side. Holy shit. There you go again with Shun. What a cry-baby. You have a kid now, you can't be moping. I'll do anything you ask. You know that I love you Kimio. I'll do anything you ask. If you want I'll be your slave. Yuji. You were fantasizing about me... while you were jerking off. How was it? You saw me... like a goddess. And now I can really touch my goddess. Just do it then. In front of my goddess? I'd feel ashamed. It's getting hard. It's OK, let me have it now. Do it like Shun. Gently but with strength. What? You're done? You're so worthless. You told me Shun did it better. Shit. "You're walking alone..." "the sound of your voice stops." "I know you didn't promise anything." "I want to cry, I'm an idiot." "Anytime I'm with you..." that's enough guys, you stop here. "I know this is impossible..." "I want to live with you." The strip club is not doing well... they're losing money. The clients aren't coming anymore. You said she was a growing star. You only have a bunch of regular jerkoffs left. Who asked for your opinion? She's in the crucial phase... I don't think you can grasp that. We are about to publish a record. And who wants to hear a pussy sing? What? One chance in a million you'll sell it. Wait and you'll see, that girl will teach you something. I'll surely show you my tongue when it happens. "I don't know who's that man waiting..." "who is burning with desire for me..." "Even though he may not win my heart." "Between a man and a woman..." "there is a dark river flowing." "A dark and deep river..." "that none of them can cross." "Yet this night I will row my boat across." "I will row my boat " A man should not declare himself defeated. Defeated? You think? This cloth is like your white flag of defeat. And who's defeating me? "Do it like Shun." I hear that every night. Just between you and me, let me tell you... Kimio came to talk to me today. She said she loves you as much as she love Shunichiro. I told her it was tricky. She said she prefers his body... but she prefers your personality. She said you have each 50%. Honestly, I hate that Shunichiro. He thinks very highly of himself... but he's just fooling around with Kimio-chan. I don't think so Ma'am... he is a serious man. What makes you think that? Why do you do her laundry? Obviously, you care dearly for her. That man wouldn't do anything for her. Especially not baby laundry. They're like your tears dropping. They may be dry by this evening. Would be great if the wind blew. I'd have to blow on them myself. Is that... Shun's shirt? What if it was? I wish you didn't wear it in my presence... it's inconsiderate. Now you're bossing me around? The old cat-lady is listening. Say, he'll be back in three days, right? 3 days, 3 days, 3 days. And then it's all up to chance. Could we get closer in just three days? I'm begging you. Take off Shun's shirt. Look at you, the pimp of a dancer. You want us to be closer. You just dropped a good job. I pay for the expenses... yet you want more consideration. Ah, I found the door the baby came out of. Do you have fun annoying me? Maybe Shun has another girl. You hear me? I can't forget his face. - Shun's Schedule - A good actor, with such a nice voice. An actor who leaves such a strong impression. Let me applaud, I'm one of Shun's biggest fans. He has a natural talent. "Give me a break." "Do I have to repeat myself?" "If you call the cops she's dead." "You heard?" "Hey, did you call mom again? "So I did." "That would be the 25th time." "Sir, hey sir, if you like my mom that much..." "why don't you marry her?" "Because you see, I hate my dad." "Listen to me..." "I'm not in love with your mom." "I'm just trying to get money from your dad." Did you see his play last year in Shinjuku? No, I didn't... I was a month away from delivering. Ah right, I see. I rarely see Shun on stage. I hate to see all these girls after the show. They rush to see him backstage. In these moments he pretends he doesn't know me... that's unbearable. 055-858-415 Enough, you're heavy. "The room you're calling is not responding." Shun didn't pick up? How are your parents? I hate to talk about them. I hate to talk about the countryside. Shun would never mention them. You didn't tell me much about the landlady. Enough, already. It's a bad habit to harass people with questions. My business is none of your business. You're interrogating me like an inspector... and you're annoying me. I gotta go. Are you Ms. Kimio Tokunaga? I came to talk to you about Shunichiro Kanzai. My name is Satoko Mizunuma. Mizunuma? So he didn't marry you. No he didn't. Would you like a coffee? Who are you? Is that any of your business? Men like you, right? I guess they do. Could you let go of Shun? What is that? You have him. I like them both. You're lonely? Is it a joke to you? Say, you wouldn't mind that. Right? You see, you see. I dearly love Kimio. But, she doesn't feel that way. In fact, she loves only Shun. Only him? I heard it's 50-50. She likes my personality... but in bed... I told you, you talk too much. You need to say it clearly. You just shut up now. One thing you should know... Shun and I have been together for six years. He said, "I want to be buried with you." How old are you? Six years ago I was in middle school. You see, he's my last chance. I turned 30... I figure I'd be happily married... in a home with kids. I'm waiting for Shun's return. How long have you been dating him? It's been half a year. It's almost nothing. He told me he stayed late at the theater. I was waiting by the phone at night. I did everything he asked. But he was here all that time. He's even playing that role on stage. I can't anymore. There's no cheating there. Shun doesn't belong to anyone. I'm begging you, you see how I feel. He's my last chance. What do I care about your life. -I'm begging you. -Enough. I can't be alone anymore, waiting for him. Give me Shun back. He's my last chance. It's OK, it's OK. Who's kid is it? Obviously, it's Shun's son. Let me hold him. He said if I got pregnant it would be over. I got an abortion for him. He forbade me to have a kid. Last time he told me he could have a kid anywhere. I'll wait for him until I die. I'll be waiting with his baby. Hey. Wait, I wanted to give it away, anyway. Is he Shun's kid? She's so envious, let her have him. She doesn't have a kid. That woman can follow Shun everywhere. I want to follow him too. If I didn't have Kazuo, I could follow Shun everywhere. Please wait. Please wait. Give me back the kid. He's Kimio's kid. He's Shun's kid. Don't you suffer? Yes I do. But you see... I'm taking care of the baby. And he's my purpose in life. Please give me the kid back. Let me take him from Shun. Help me take him. I want Kimio for me only. I'm fed up with her obsession with Shun. When he comes back from his tour... she keeps telling me that she'll get rid of me. You don't understand my pain. Can't you see I suffer? My dream was to be with her... to be able to have sex with her. Then all of a sudden she was in my arms. To hold her is my greatest joy. I can hardly believe Shun and I grew up together. We were already so different. They'd say we were like a turtle and an eagle. And the only thing this turtle can do... is to take care of this baby. Diapers aren't an easy chore you know. You can't throw them loaded with shit in the machine... You have to pick it with your nails. Then your nails get all brown. I can't stand the stench. Dealing thoroughly with his shit, is how I show my love. Soon I'll lick it off him. You know how baby shit tastes? It's so sweet, it's so great. Come on, are you about to cry? Be a man. There, you can have the baby back. I bet one day you'll be able to replace Shun in her heart. Snatch that woman away from him. Replace him. You'll replace him. I'm begging you. Please, please. Subdue her desire. Subdue her. We'll have our revenge on Shun. We'll have our revenge. Shun. Shun. Idiot. He said he needed my support... for his show to appear on TV. I started to earn for him. I worked in that horrible bar. Everything I did for him. Everything I endured for him. Why don't you say it? "Shun is an idiot." Shun. Shun. You too are obsessed. Well. "I didn't expect to be so famous abroad." "Cannes Film Festival -Shunichiro Kanzai" "Acclaimed as he receives the Palme d'Or" "Shunichiro Kanzai, a remarkable actor" "I didn't expect to be so famous abroad." "Mr. Shunichiro Kanzai, I am your most passionate fan..." "your most passionate fan" "Mr. Kanzai" "passionate fan"..." 055-858-415 at Nishiizu Hotel. 055-858-415 Ah. Hello. I'd like to talk with Mr. Kanzai from the theater company. "Hello" "Mr. Kanzai will now take your call." It's me, Yuji. Why do you call me here? I'm busy right now. I must talk to you about Kimio. Idiot, you have to call me every time she coughs? I'm not letting her go back with you. What? Idiot, what do you mean by that? She's mine now. Does she agree with that? Hey? Are you fucking right now? Are you drunk or what? You wouldn't be that silly if you were sober. "And you want Kimio for you alone?" "Is she there with you? Let me talk to her." She's not here, right now. You think I'm gonna be there for ever... in the audience cheering your life. I've had enough cheering you, my hands are sore. That was a nice bar. Make yourselves at home. I brought Kazuo back. I knew that, I heard you talk with that woman. You found some snacks? What is this? I cooked curry. Don't you know tomorrow is my premiere. So the day before I'm as nervous as a virgin. So I want the fireworks. Don't you know curry is bad juju? Are you kidding me? You want me to have lose bowels on stage? I cooked three hours for you. Keep your diarrhea. Your brain is as weak as your dick. I'm doing my best. Tomorrow the club opens, Shun was really great. He took a suit room at the Imperial Hotel... treated me to the finest French cuisine. Whatever I said about him, I was too harsh on him. And he is so kind to me, like Jesus. I'm doing my best, can't you see? It's all about you, you, you. An idiot does what an idiot can do. That's as high as your highest ability. Leave me alone. Hey, hey. Hey you, enough. Can't you know your place like a good pimp? You can't upset our dancing girl on such a day. That's against your pimp ethic. Alright? You should be so grateful that Mayumi keeps you here. Aren't you honored? Just ponder on this. The simple fact that Mayumi allows me to talk to her... just this moves me to tears. You should worship this dancing girl. Do you know how many men... dream of holding her in their arms? Let me tell you one thing... I'm not her pimp. You should only speak words of love. What are you doing for Mayumi-chan? Do you at least change the baby's diapers? You think your rotten-shit rice curry is love? Pour your heart into this. What else do you do for her? You think it's enough to just lay around. You think that is enough love to fulfill all her needs? Because since the first day I saw Mayumi... I have dearly loved her. But she wouldn't even grant me a glance. This invitation is a rare blessing. My chest is overwhelmed with this love for her. When I see how ungrateful you are... it makes me feel like crushing you. You fuck her as much as you like and I can't. Can't you shut up. I should be glad, but I can't ask for more. I get that, OK, I get that. You don't get it. Ask Chou-san what's the good pimp ethic. His girl is a dancer on stage too. Look at Chou-san, you are just like him. After she fuck with her customers... she has him lick her all night long. Right, Chou-san? Look at her... she never uses condoms. She asks them specifically to not use any. I have a silicon allergy, it irritates my flesh. You get it now? Do you see how far Chou-san is ready to go? That's how much Chou-san loves her. Because he loves her so much. He seems about to cry. Hearing this fills you with gratefulness? It doesn't seem so, idiot. They're tears of complaints. He doesn't belong with us anyway. I don't care if he cries, I want him outa' here. My premiere is tomorrow, he's bad juju. You don't know how a stripper feels. Please, I'm asking you, don't cast your gloom on me. You see that we're having a good time. Go now, I just want you to go now. I want you to go now, go now. "Don't leave me now." "Please don't leave me just now." "Those painful memories..." "will stay with me forever." "So please don't leave me now." "Please forgive me." "Look at me now..." "I couldn't stand it if you left me." Please let me stay. "Don't leave me now." I'll hide in a corner. "Don't leave me now." I'm begging you. "Don't leave me now." "Please don't leave me just now." "Those painful memories..." "will stay with me forever." Poor Kazuo, I even tried to kill him once. I pressed like this, like this, like this. I was so lonely, I didn't know what to do. I'd kill my kid and they'd execute me. Obviously, I'm an unfit mother. If I don't have the right man... I'm done. I'm afraid I'm losing my mind. That's because you see only Shun. But I'm here. I don't know, I don't know. Shun. Say 'Shun' again I'll kill you. I won't say it, I won't say it. Help me. Shun, help me, no. Stop. Stop, don't. No, don't. No, stop I don't want. Shun. I'll kill you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuji. Yuji. Yuji. Yuji. Come. Yuji come. Come. Yuji. Come. Come. Come Yuji. Come, come. We made a baby. You understand? It happened the same way for Kazuo. What will I do with a second child? If you were Shun, what would you say? Say. What would you say? Mayumi, Mayumi. Mayumi, Mayumi. Mayumi, Mayumi. Mayumi, Mayumi. Mayumi, Mayumi. I'm asking you please... I'm asking you please... please switch off the lights. Wonderful. Don't. Softly. Hello. Hello? Yes. It's you Yuji? Yes. I'm in Tokyo. I have a day off. I'll arrive a noon. Wait a moment. Hello. Hello? Ah, he's so heavy. Move aside. Where were you? The doctor. A regular check up. He's all fine. Move. What's wrong? I didn't see you when I woke up. I looked for you. I wonder if Shun called. I was waiting for a taxi... suddenly I had this feeling. He called, yes he called. Great. Don't joke about it. You know how sensitive I am about Shun. Yes he called, he's coming at noon. Really? Why would I lie? So it's true. Today is his day off. And he's coming at noon? Yuji please... I rarely ask you for something. Please give us some privacy. Please take Kazuo for a walk until tonight. We have to disappear? Aren't you asking for a lot? No, it's just that we need to catch up. We haven't seen each other for such a long time. Don't you think it's a lot to ask. Please, don't get mad, please. You don't understand my relationship with Shun. You two just go some place. We didn't have time to discuss anything. You guys will have to get yourselves a room. This is my place. And so? That's how it is. What if I trash Kazuo? What if as we're on the street.. I'm upset and I trash him? I'm unpredictable, I would kill Kazuo. I'm fine with that. You have to do as I say. I'm unpredictable, I'm unpredictable. I don't care if you're unpredictable. Then just get out alone. Get out this instant. You don't want me anymore? Your bath isn't ready yet, come out. Hey. Hey, open the door. I can't live without you. Open this door, now. What's with you Mr. Crab? What's wrong? Yo. Hey. You came to welcome me? We switch players. Kimio is waiting, you'll be just the two of you. You look like shit. I'm back tomorrow. Yes, come in the morning. So our goddess likes our ménage-à-trois. Right. Don't overdo it. Of course, I overdid it. I just signed for a soap opera. I was about to refuse... but they begged me to accept. They forced my hand, promising a TV Prize. Please, watch me on TV, bye. Bye. Welcome back. I'm sweaty already, prepare a bath. It's ready. I'll take it with you. You can't have another baby. I'm not in the "idol trend"... so I don't really care. But the theater company is getting nervous. But I really don't care. But whatever your fame, you're just a stripper. Haven't you opened your legs enough already for these jerkoffs? Just quit. I'll provide for you. OK? Watch out. The baby is sleeping, don't step on him. I'm sss ssso sorry. Who the hell are you? That is, I'm the previous tenant. I found this old key while cleaning up. I thought I'd try if it still works. I'm sorry. I'll go before Madam comes back. I'm not married. But, the baby? A woman who scorned my love... I just kidnapped her kid. Eh? What? You're a bit extreme, aren't you? Look at you. You're frustrated because she cheated. Cheaters can't help themselves. I'm just like that. I loved someone, but I got fed up. I told him I'd rather be on my own. I know someone like you. He got on my nerves, I broke up. I thought, at last I had found Mr. Right, but... this one was always on trips, in and out. I regret the time when I lived alone here. Sorry. I'm the kind of man who stays with a woman... here I am... I'm the slave. The slave. Yes. I thought she'd appreciate it... to have her slave lover. But see... I'm just a crab. Meaning, you step sideways? Yet child abduction is a bold step forward. I'm baby sitting. When she has no one else... she pays me to lay around. Ah, you're her plan B man. How do we call a man like you. A pimp. That's even too high. I'm a low-life pimp then? This is what I'm worth. The crab? That's a strange feeling... it feels great here. You never get upset whatever people tell you. May I stay the night? There's just one bed. We could share. OK? We just touch ourselves. That's all I want. The perfect love. Please let me. What time? 11:30. Don't. Shun is gone? My desire left when I got pregnant. This is common for women. What did you just say? Shun left, he'll never come again. What do you mean pregnant? You want me to say "I love you"? Excuse me. Please wait. She'll be out in a minute. She has to get dressed. She'll be out in a minute. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Excuse me. Please wait a minute. She has to get dressed. Excuse me. Forgive me. Mayumi, Mayumi. Mayumi, Mayumi. Mayumi, Mayumi.
