Excuse me, sir... May I point out it's the first of the month. - And so...? - Mr. Kristian is coming tonight. I know, and...? I wanted to ask if I could have the second box for tonight. - Why? Mr. Kristian sits there. He gives such big tips that we at the other tables feel hard done by. Impossible! No newfangled ideas. Mr. Kristian is accustomed to Robert. Take your places, we're opening. Excuse me, Madame, you dropped your handkerchief. Thank you. May I? What will it be, sir? Whiskey. Mr. Kristian. At your service, sir. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - If you please, sir. - Thank you, dear. - My respects, Doctor. - Good evening. - My compliments, Rector. - Good evening. It's a pleasure, My Lord. - My salutations, sir. - Good evening. - Usual table, Ambassador. - Thank you. - Such a pleasure to see you again, Count. - Good evening. - Sir... - Keep the change. Wait a bit longer, Peter. She'll be here any minute. You said that half an hour ago. You must agree Susie is worth waiting for. Fred, I wanted to ask you - do you really love Susan? That depends on what you mean. One can love twenty girls at the same time. But you love only Susan? Well - how shall I explain. Susan's a special case, she gets terribly jealous. - I don't want to hurt her. - Of course, not. But you know me long enough. Did I ever let a woman disconcert me? Excuse me. Susie, at last! Where were you so long? I couldn't wait to see you. May I? You can't imagine the torture of just sitting here. Waiting for you and feeling jealous of anyone who just dares to look at you. Good evening. So I didn't wait in vain either, but now I must go, I'm afraid. A lady in the offing? No, only a business partner. But I couldn't forego the pleasure of seeing you. Now I must go. - Good night. - Good night! - Have a good time. - I'll be seeing you, Peter. What will it be, Madame? - Choose something, Fred. - Will you eat? No, you know I've had dinner. - Well...? - Oh, sorry. - Gordon Rouge, year '24. - Yes, sir. - What did you do all day? - Feel bored. - Bored? How's that? - Everything's boring. My dressmaker, the fashion show, my hairdresser... Waiting for an evening that would be the same as yesterday, tomorrow, the day after... Oh but Susie, that's not my fault. I do my best... No, no Fred. You have no imagination. You are so cruelly predictable. You pick up the wine list, study it for ages and finally decide for the Gordon Rouge again. - Well, come on, Fred! - What do you mean, Susie? So start telling me how many sets you played, what people said at tennis, how your horse is doing, how your car's acting up again, and so on. Come on, start, Fred! Miss... would you do me a kindness? Of course, sir. - Listen, Miss... er... - Lida, sir. Listen, Miss Lida. A lady and gentleman sitting in the next box... Madame, you dropped... My handkerchief. An old trick. Try something new, sir. Whiskey, sir? - Yes. - Sir. So tell me what to do to amuse you. How can I tell you that? - Excuse me, Mr. Fred? - Yes? There was a phone call for you. A Mr. Peter asks you to come to his place at once. That it's urgent and important. Didn't he just want me called to the phone? Oh no, he sounded very vexed and hung up immediately. Thank you. Susie, what shall I do? You must go to him if it's so serious. - Will you come with me? - No. I never let you drive me on principle. You drive like mad, I'd rather wait here for 15 minutes than lie in hospital for 3 weeks. You dropped your handkerchief, Madame. - I? No. - No? That's odd. Excuse me. - Yes, what do you want? - That was my question. How's that? I am this lady's husband, if you don't mind. No, I certainly don't mind. Some mistake. Forgive me. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Forgive me for making out that you are my wife, it seemed the simplest way to get rid of that... Thank you. I cannot stand a man who misuses every situation to join a lady if she is alone. - What are you doing? - I'm sitting down. Why? - I have to talk to you. - I have nothing to say. Never mind, you can just listen. Do you smoke? - No. - May I, then? In that case - yes, thanks. Please go away or I'll call the waiter. He can neither see or hear when I don't want him to. But this is assault. Oh no, it's caution. Fred will have it out with you. But it'll take a while before he returns. How do you know? Because I sent him to that man Peter's place. You did? Why? Look in your mirror. Why? Please take a look in your mirror. Can't you see? What am I to see? Can't you see how lovely you are? For the last time. Please go. - And if I don't go? - Then I shall. Surely you wouldn't... - So you thought that I would... - Yes, I did. You were wrong. - Let me go. - No I won't. Let me go or I'll start screaming. - No you won't. - Yes I will! I'm sure you don't want to make a scene. All you can do is dance and smile at me. So you think I'm helpless... Absolutely. - What if I step on your toes? - Just you try. - I'm so sorry. - That's all right. Just for this one day is life worth living this is peace of mind I long for nothing more. Just for this one day maybe for your smile life will turn into a dream the day I meet happiness. Ask me not about yesterday nor what happens tomorrow just hold this day and realize it's the most wonderful of all. Just for this one day is life worth living. This is peace of mind I long for nothing more. So you won't let me go. - How can I? - Why not? Look, fate itself refuses to let us part. Do you believe in fate? I do. I believe in just this day, I believe in your beauty, believe.... - I believe one thing only. - And that is? That were I to search forever I wouldn't find a man as impertinent as you are. You call it impertinence? I call it truth. Be as true to yourself and admit that at least you aren't bored. Had you wanted to leave, you had countless opportunities. Had you wanted to call the waiter you would have called him. You could have made a big scene and had me thrown out. But you did nothing of the kind. Excuse me. Why didn't you have me thrown out? There was your opportunity. I'm amazed at myself for not having done so. I don't even know who you are. My name is Kristian. That doesn't mean anything to me. I swear that tomorrow or in six months' time, when you remember Kristian it will mean something to you. Do you smoke? Thanks. What do you do...? I'm sitting here looking at you. No, I mean what do you do in life? Imagine, I do nothing at all. Poor man, isn't it too tiring? Not really. Do you live in Prague? I stay here when I'm not travelling. You travel? It's my greatest passion. - What cigarettes are these? - Why? They're wonderfully strong. My last memento of my travels in Egypt. I remember when I bought them in Cairo. A tropical night, murmuring palms, the sea crooning a lullaby, the cicadas yearning for their pale lover, the Moon and the night fragrant with cinnamon and coffee. Above it all the haunting call of a muezzin from a distant mosque. You have a fabulous imagination. Yes, if you knew what I'm imagining while looking at you... That wouldn't be hard to guess. But don't say it. Why not? You can hear me out. - You risk nothing. - That's true. Tonight I saw you for the first time. I didn't know you, you didn't know me. That's absolutely delightful. Nothing between us, not even lies. Fantastic. Two lone human beings meet and cling together, exchange their secret dreams, forgetting that tomorrow they'll feel deserted and unhappy again. Why should we be unhappy? Because we'll never meet again. Only this night belongs to us, but we can go away together and dance till morning. - But... - Admit that not even in your dreams did you expect any passionate adventure from Fred, whom you meet every day to drink Gordon Rouge. Did you never long for something different, something unexpected, something tremendous? Why tell me all this? Because you might leave. Because only minutes remain before I carry you off. And if I'm reluctant to go with you? But why? I'm afraid of you. That is so because no longer do I speak with words, only with my heartbeats. I offer you the scent of the unexpected. The courage for you to wish for something better than standard love from someone like Fred. - Be silent. - I cannot keep silent. I must convince you of the magic of this moment, let's grasp it and rebel against humdrum life. We have no right to ignore such a special moment. Yes. Let's leave. No, I shall leave. I'll wait outside. I'd like you to follow me of your own will. Think it over. Shut your eyes... say nothing. Close your eyes. I'm leaving... I'll be waiting. Au revoir. Thank you, sir. What's that? - Mr. Kristian's card case. - Give it to me. - Waiter... - Yes, sir? - Where is the lady? - She left. - When? - Right after the gentleman she was sitting with. - She sat with a gentleman? Yes sir, the one she danced with. She was dancing? Yes, with the gentleman with whom she then sat in the Mocca salon. What did he look like? - Like a gentleman. - I'm asking who he was. I know his name is Kristian, but that's all, I'm afraid... - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? Your bill, sir. - Excuse me... - Yes, ma'am? - Have you seen Mr. Kristian? - He just left. - He left? - Yes, ma'am. Thank you. But don't worry. The lady is sure to return. Look. What is it, Susie? Why are you doing this? Because I'm furious! You are furious? I went to Peter's, he knew nothing, hadn't phoned here at all. I came back to hear you danced with some man and actually left with him. If one of us has reason to be furious, it's certainly not you. It's me! - Don't shout at me! - Who's shouting? - You're shouting at me. - No, I'm not! - You're yelling at me! - Will you kindly explain... I have nothing to explain. Nothing happened, unfortunately. Unfortunately? That's the limit. Madame... - Excuse me, sir. - What is it? Just your bill, sir. Miss, who was that gentleman sitting with me? - Mr. Kristian of course. - I know, but where does he live? I'm sorry, I don't know. Good night, sir. Madam. - Waiter... - At your service. Who was the gentleman who sat here? - Mr. Kristian. - I know, but who is he? - Our favorite patron, Madame. - Does he come every day? - No, once a month. - Alone? Actually, he arrives alone but then he sits with a lady. - With a lady? - A different one every time. - Does he leave with her? - No, always on his own. But the song he sang for you, he sings that for every lady. Susie, please don't torture me. What is it, Signore? Stop bothering me at once. Forgive me, but I... sorry. Madame. Good night. Ah, could you.... I can depend on your discretion, I hope. Of course, Madame. I wouldn't like anyone to know. - I understand. - You see Mr. Kristian... I want this sent to his apartment. Note it down. - A platter of ham and cheese... - Ham and cheese... - Two bottles of champagne... - Two bottles... - You know the address. - Of course, Siroka no. 13 - Correct. Mr. Kristian... - Novak, Siroka 13. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Another thing. There's no need to send the ham and champagne, now that I have the address. Thank you. Good night... The lady I was here with, has she gone? Yes sir. Now please tell me that gentleman's address. - Mr. Kristian's? - Yes - I can't do that. - Not for any money? Not even for... - Good morning. - Can I help you? Can I speak to Mr. Novak, please? - He's not at home. - When will he be back? - At twenty past twelve. - Can I leave him a message? Yes, come in. Maybe I can tell him. Oh no, it's a private matter. Excuse me, but I'm Mrs. Novak. What? You... Are you Kristian Novak's wife? No, I am Alois Novak's wife. Forgive me, there must be some mistake. Last night I was at a night club with Mr. Kristian Novak and they gave me your address. Sorry to have bothered you. That's all right. But this is Kristian! - You were at a night club with him? - Yes, who is it? My husband's... his brother. My brother-in-law. Where can I find him? I must talk to him. - He made such an impression? - Yes. If you knew... Please sit down. He is wonderful. He comes when not expected and leaves as suddenly. When he speaks of moonlight nights and cicadas singing... If you knew how romantic he is. And how beautifully he sings. What? He sings? Yes, he sang as we were dancing. You danced together? Yes. At the Orient Club. This must be some mistake. It can't be my brother-in-law. He doesn't go to night clubs, nor does he dance or sing. But I have his address... Someone impersonated him, a bad practical joke. Some mistake, definitely. So excuse me for bothering you. Goodbye. - Forgive me, Mrs. Novak. Goodbye. - Goodbye. We'd like some information about the Orient. Right. We'd like to travel to the Orient, wouldn't we, darling? Yes, darling. I would recommend Cairo. Cairo - what do you think, sweetie? Cairo sounds very nice, love... Cairo is a fairy-tale city, the sea murmuring its eternal song, cicadas fluttering in the air... - Do cicadas bite? - No, on the contrary. They sing to their lover the Moon, air fragrant with cinnamon and coffee, in the distance a muezzin's call from a faraway mosque, calling " Allah in Allah". Full board for 60 to 150 crowns, percentage and spa tax included. I recommend the Grand Imperial, Paris or Roma Hotels. And how do we get there? It's best to go by plane. I'll be happy to show you on the map. Thank you very much. I'll show Madame too. Kindly step this way. So it's either by train Prague - Trieste, then by boat to Port Said and Cairo. Or by plane. Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade Sofia, Athens, Alexandria, Cairo. Right on the side. Thank you. My wife and I will study the leaflets and... We'll think about it. As you please. My respects, Madame. - Thank you again. - My pleasure. What can I do for you? I'd like to speak to Mr. Novak. Can I help you? Some information? Yes, I'd like some information about Mr. Kristian. Pardon? I didn't understand. - I'm looking for your brother. - For whom? Your brother, Kristian Novak. My brother, of course. I understand. My brother... Sorry, I never talk about him. I can offer information about Africa, a tour down the Nile, plan of Mediterranean trip, but I refuse to speak of my brother! But I want his address! I refuse to have anything to do with Kristian. Why? He's your brother! - Unfortunately, Madame. - Why unfortunately? He's the black sheep of the family. The way he lives! His women - one today, another tomorrow. - All those wild parties... - I don't believe it. Surely I must know my brother. No! I see Kristian quite differently. He has magic allure... He is simply wonderful. Isn't he... that's how he traps victims, he exploits trusting women and breaks their hearts. I have to warn you. Please. Just forget that Kristian exists. Kristian is a lost case. An adventurer. Wonderful! Just the man I am looking for. I must see him again! Then I cannot help you. I did what I could. - I warned you. - You won't give me his address? Definitely not. I refuse to have that on my conscience. So my only alternative is to look up your wife. She'll tell me where to find him. But that... just a moment! Not that, please. Please don't do that. My wife gets very agitated when she hears about my brother. I'll ring him up, tell him that you wish to see him. All right, so call him. Right now. No, at this time of day he wouldn't be in. Just try. This is Alois, is my brother in? I'll pass on the phone. But keep it short, please. Banker Voticky may not be upset. Hello, this is Voticky. What have you been up to now? What impertinence! Don't pretend you don't know. The young lady is here. Young lady... what young lady? The one you were on a binge with. I wasn't, I don't go out at all. I can't even walk. I'm a sick man. No excuses, you're not sick. I know you, you scoundrel. How dare you?! - Doctor, he's calling me names! - Just keep calm. That's right, I'm calm. I mustn't get aggravated, it would be the death of me. You must see her and that's that! I've had enough. You are a mean lout, mister. I'm not allowed to get agitated. Give me the phone, I'll tell him. He's hung up. Pity. Thanks, Mr. Novak. Goodbye. A pleasure.... Yes? Oh. Please tell your brother that if he doesn't come I'll kick up a real scandal! That's the way. That's what he deserves. Make a big scandal for him. Not him, I'll make a big scandal for you. Here. Oh my, what do you mean? Excuse me. Good morning, sir. Ask Mr. Novotny to my office. Yes sir. Mr. Novotny, the director wants you. Sure, I'm on my way. - What can I do for you? - If Kristian doesn't turn up at the Orient Club tonight, I'll be forced to make a scandal for you here. And then what will your boss say? - Who is that lady? - She's the lady who is the wife of the man who is Alois Novak's brother. Wife of Kristian Novak, who is our Mr. Alois Novak's brother. - Mr. Novak has a brother? - Sure, such an elegant type. Lives it high. Nothing like our Mr. Novak at all. I see. Thank you. So is your brother coming tonight? Yes, I promise to do my best to get my brother to go to... where is he to go? - The Orient Club. - The O - Orient. I'd better note it down. Orient. The address... - He'll know that. - So he knows. - Thank you. - That's all right. - At ten! - At ten. What a mess. Don't you worry, I've set it right. - How? - The director asked about the lady. - Oh my goodness! - I didn't give you away. I only told him she's the wife of your brother Kristian. This is going all wrong. Too late to moan, I warned you not to play around with Kristian. Anyway, why do you do it? Why? You'd never understand. Nobody would and yet it's so simple and clear. I'd die if I had to live a drab and dreary life. Nothing but telling clients about magic nights in Cairo, cicadas and cinnamon and be tied to window no. 6. I keep telling them about the Canary Islands while all I know is my canary that doesn't even sing. And it's yellow! It's easy for you to laugh. You're contented with your lot, I quite envy you. But I... I talk about the enchantment of travel in the Orient, and never get out of Prague city. So I go to The Orient Club once a month, for at least a different Orient than on these dusty leaflets. That's why I work overtime, bring extra work home, to save a few pennies on my secret account which fizz away once a month in a spent balloon. Once in a while I need an evening all to myself. To feel that I haven't lost the game of life yet and to dine in a room with flowers, white table-cloths, music, waiters in tailcoats... Yes? I'd like a leaflet about your trips to the Orient. Let me recommend Cairo. A fairy-tale city. The sea murmurs, cicadas sing. Good prices, excellent service. I recommend the Grand Imperial, the Paris and Roma Hotels. - I'm just about... - Just look at you. Your yearnings... and all in vain. Men like you shouldn't get married. I wanted to marry, I love Marie. But we are so different. One of us wants to fly high, the other is tied to the ground. Every day I tell Marie: let's go out, to the cinema or the theatre or at least a coffee house, where there's life. She always says: No, dearest, we must economize. Put your slippers on and let's play dominoes. It's not a bad game, but the dots make one's eyes ache. Not a bad game? Try playing it every evening for 10 years and how you'll hate dominoes. That's why I invented Kristian, who can say the crazy things Alois Novak never can utter because nobody would believe him. This is Mr. Novak's apartment. Can I speak to Mr. Novak, please? He is not at home. Where would I find him? At the travel bureau See the World. Who's calling? I'm Lida, cloakroom attendant from the Orient Club. This is Mr. Novak's apartment. Is Mr. Novak in, please? No, he isn't. Where would I find him? It's very urgent. At the travel bureau See the World. Who's calling, please? A friend from the Orient Club. See the World, department Africa, the Orient. I'm Lida, cloakroom attendant from the Orient Club. Something dreadful happened, sir, promise you won't get angry. No, I won't get angry. All my passions are spent. What has happened? I've given your address to the gentleman who was with the lady, whom you... What a goose you are. Sorry. No, I'm not angry, I'm delighted. I wanted to warn you in time. He may come to your apartment this afternoon. Thanks a lot for your help. Better and better. Don't complain, you'll be going out to the Orient Club tonight. You'll have music, waiters in tails... But all is withdrawn from my secret account. All I have is 30 crowns. You'd better go or there'll be trouble at home. That young lady didn't look like she was joking. I only have 20. You don't have to order anything. Mr. Alois Novak is wanted at the director's office. - Why take your hat and coat? - I might as well. I think the boss is about to kick me out. Goodbye, Josef. - Mr. Novak, sir. - Ask him in. My respects, sir. Good morning, come in, Mr. Novak, I'd like to speak to you. I don't just sit here, you know. I have eyes everywhere. Exactly. I think Mr. Novotny could easily attend to your agenda too. I guess that's the only solution. It's a pity, really. You've grown used to the Orient. I could do without the Orient if necessary. It's the only way. So you won't be sitting at that window any more. No. That's inevitable, I suppose. Do you smoke? - Sir. - Help yourself. - After you, sir. - Come on, have one. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Take a seat. Come on, sit down. You see I go abroad tomorrow for quite some time to our branch in Amsterdam. And I need a deputy. I arrived at the opinion that you are the right man. Sir, surely I do not deserve your confidence. Yes you do, Mr. Novak. You are a reputable man, diligent, hardworking. No revels, no night clubs... Well, no indeed sir... no night clubs. Good, that's settled. Take the rest of the day off and arrange to start here tomorrow morning. I have full confidence in you. Don't disappoint me. So - au revoir, and good luck. My best regards to your brother and his wife. - To whom? - Regards to your brother. - Oh, my brother. - And his wife. I'll convey the message. Thank you. Goodbye for now. - Where does Mr. Novak sit? - At window no. 6. Thanks. Welcome, is it the Canary Islands you want, sir? - No. I want to beat you up. - But why, sir? Don't pretend you don't know about Susan and the Orient Club. Well actually, I do. You sleazy old scoundrel! I imagined you an interesting-looking man, but just look at you! It's none of your business what I look like. I meant to pull you apart. But I shan't bother. - Thank you kindly. Leave Susan alone, see?! You won't meet again! You don't say. Won't she coming to the Orient Club tonight? - You have a date with her? - It's not me, it's... I warn you! If you come with her to the Orient Club tonight you'll be leaving in an ambulance! - But how's that? - I shall be waiting there with my friend Peter, you'll see quite a show. - Are you going to dance? - You'll stop joking! I repeat, come to the Orient tonight and I'll break both your legs. You'd better watch out! Oh yes, I will. Hey, when Mr. Novak comes out tell him to come here! Mr. Novak has gone and won't be back today. - The director sent him home. - Thank you. Love and kisses Marie. Dear Auntie, something awful has happened. My Alois is unfaithful to me with a very painted lady. It'll be the death of me. I won't let on today not to spoilt our anniversary, but tomorrow... It's Friday. That means noodles with poppy seed topping. - Hello Marie. - Hello Alois dear. - Tonight we'll celebrate. - I know, dear. - What do you know? - That we'll celebrate. You're crying again? I have a surprise for you. We'll live differently now, we needn't save every penny. My dear, I've been promoted to director's deputy. - Oh... - There now. Aren't you glad? What is it now? - Didn't you remember? - What? It's the second today. Yes, the second. I was so pleased I forgot. It's the 2nd, we have to pay the phone bill, right? Yes, the phone! - Did anyone look for me, dear? - No, dear. - Wait, that's enough, dear. - So little? I'm not hungry today. Those stag-parties of yours are doing you no good. - Now! - What? - Didn't you hear footsteps? - No, are you expecting anyone? No, but sometimes one doesn't expect a person and they might be at the door. But why wouldn't they ring the doorbell, then? - The bell may not be working. - So they'd knock. I guess you're right. - What is it? - The mineral water. I see, put it down here. - Is it paid for? - Yes, sir. - Wait, here. - Thank you. My respects. Good day to you. - What was that, dear? - The mineral water, what else? - Enjoy, dear. - Enjoy, dear. Thank you. Isn't it too hot in here? Not at all. It's 16 degrees as usual. There's something I forgot to tell you, dear. What is it? - Well, tonight... - Yes dear, tonight...? - I'm going out. - You're going out? Don't cry again, try to understand. I have an important meeting. - Didn't someone knock? - No. Important, with the director. We must make arrangements to settle some details. - But tonight is... It's no use dear, tonight you must do without dominoes. The director asked me to come, so I must go. I'm telling you quite honestly that I hate having to go. - What is it? - You go, please. Don't let anyone in, whoever it may be. Say I've gone and won't be back. That I'll never be back again. - Hello, Mrs. Novak. - Hello. - Is Alois in? - He left and won't be back today. That's bad... How do I let him know? - What? - About a meeting tonight. With the director, I know. No... yes, the director. But he doesn't have to go, the director can't come. I'm so glad he needn't go, it's our 10th wedding anniversary. So the meeting is off? Mind you tell him not to go. Will you give him the message? - No. - Why not? - Because he won't be back. - But where did he go? - I don't know. - So how do I find him?! I must find him or there'll be a tragedy. - I'm so happy, dear! - Who was it? - Mr. Novotny. - What did he want? To tell you that you needn't go to that meeting. That the director can't go. I know that the director can't go. So why did you want to go if you knew that he... No, the director can go, but I can't. I'm so glad you'll stay at home. No, I can't stay at home. You've got me all mixed up. The director might go and I might go too. Josef's such a muddle-pate. The director wouldn't confide in him, my dear. I must know what the director might do or not. I must go to that meeting or it'll all end in disaster. Do you think that man Kristian will come? - I doubt it. - What does he look like? Just awful. A ruin of a man. But if he has the guts to come he'll get a beating. - Cloakroom, sir. - No thanks, I'll be off again. - Flowers? - No, I'll be off again. Has Mr. Kristian arrived? But Mr. Kristian isn't coming. - Yes he is. - No, definitely not. Impertinence! Call the director. Who are you looking for? - The director! - But that's me. What a coincidence, the director... and it's you. - What can I do for you? - I wish to speak to Mr. Kristian. Impossible, he isn't coming. How would you know. I'm meeting him here. In that case please come in. - No, this is where I stay. - We can't have that. Mr. Kristian is our best patron. We hold him in high esteem. Nice view from here, actually... This way, please, come in. - Knock me down with a feather. - What's up? - He's over there. - Who? Kristian. - Will you be dining, sir? - No, I had my supper. - A drink, sir? - Of course. Here is the wine list. I want the spring waters list. - Madame... - Good evening. - Is Mr. Kristian here yet? - No, he isn't. I'll be waiting for him in the small salon. Yes, madame. I expected an anniversary party and you're crying. Wouldn't you cry, Auntie, if your husband... I never cry, I'd smudge my eyelashes. When I get mad I light a cigarette. But I don't smoke. So pour yourself a brandy and pull yourself together. We don't buy hard drink. Alois complains of his kidney so we have mineral water. He drinks water at home and treats his kidney with champagne at a night club. How often does he go? I wrote you all about it. - I didn't get your letter. - I haven't sent it off yet. - He takes a young lady to a night club. That doesn't surprise me. - What? - Look at yourself. - Why? I know what I'm like. Just look at yourself. Do not wait for me don't expect me back life is much too short the white boat beckons. Do not wait for me it is goodbye for ever I shall wave to you and seek solitude. Excuse me, Mr. Director. Your card case. - Oh, did I... - Yes, you did. I'm so glad. Thank you. My deep respects, sir. Good evening, I shan't stay... Where shall we go? Actually, why not stay? It isn't so bad here. So why did you run off yesterday? Well, because... why? I'll tell you... Why? That's quite simple. - Well? - Well because... - Why? - Don't you understand? No, I only know you sit here often with a lady. A different one every time. And then you run off alone. The song you sang for me you sing here every time. Did all the ladies tolerate that? You'd be surprised, they did. Except for one. - And who was that? - You. - Compliments again? Don't bother. You didn't sweep me off my feet like you did the others. I sent you a message through your brother just to tell you that you're no gentleman. Maybe it was all good enough for the other ladies but definitely not for me. Three, four, five, ten. Shall I bring another, sir? No, no. I knew at once you were different. - Is that why you fled? - Yes. I fled out of fear. What do you mean? I feared you'd disrupt my life. You have no idea who I am, how I live. What do you know about life? When I met you I felt with all my senses that because of you I am fated to stop roaming the world all alone. With you I'd drink in the fragrance of the sea, really hear cicadas sing. Yes, you must dream with me. Shut your eyes. Stay where you are. Close your eyes. I am leaving. I'll be waiting outside. - Enough! - I beg your pardon? We played at that yesterday. We'll change the game tonight. - Sit down. - But really... Don't speak. Shut your eyes. Close your eyes, I'm leaving. I'll be waiting outside. Au revoir. And be careful. Why? Fred and his friend are here. Any other wishes, sir? No. I have to go. I'd like to point out that a gentleman awaits you. - I know, downstairs. - No, in your box. Ah, that's different. - Josef, what are you doing here? - You'd better not ask. - Just don't look down there. - Why not? A man down there thinks that you are me. I mean that I am you. Disappear, and fast! That's easily said, but I can't pay my bill. - Don't worry, I'll pay up. - You've got money? 10 crowns, I only had spring water. But I had champagne! If I am happy with water only, you might be as well. What shall we do? I've got 30 crowns. It'll be a scandal anyway. Get gone. Look how they're staring. If I don't come to the office bail me out of here. - Now he's alone. - Do we go there? Have him called to the phone, we'll beat him up there. Please call out Mr. Novak for us. Shout "Mr. Novak to the phone". Sorry, that's not customary. You can do it for once, can't you? Thank you. Good night. So where shall we go? Actually...Where shall we go? - I don't know, sir. - Where shall we go? - I'm ready for a surprise. - So, you will be surprised! Drive straight ahead. I'll tell you when we get there. Attention please, Mr. Novak has a phone call. Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me, I'm Novak, excuse me... Excuse me, has Mr. Kristian gone? He had to leave suddenly. But I'm paying the bill. I never worry about Mr. Kristian's bill, sir. - Never? - Never. - How much is it? -180 crowns. I'll stay on for a little longer, it's really nice place here. Who is that man? - I don't know, sir. - That's not Mr. Kristian? No. Mr. Kristian just left. The man who talked to him, was that Mr. Kristian? - Yes sir. - Thanks. So you are not Kristian? No, and I never was. Why didn't you say so at the office? You wouldn't let me speak! The man you just talked to is Kristian Novak, right? It's hard to deny if you know. Mr. Novak is employed at your travel bureau. - You won't find him there. - So where do we find him? That's hard to say. Could I offer you a drink? Why not? It's nice of you to have a drink with us. Why just one? What are you thinking of? You. I'm thinking of a comparison. I can only compare you to an orchid of Zanzibar. - Do you know Zanzibar? - No, I don't. Zanzibar has magnificent flora. Flowers wherever you look, nothing but orchids. The lowest temperature is 29 degrees C. The days are scorching hot, but orchids prosper like a dream. The air gets so hot it's hard to breathe. You feel helpless... the heat is plain torture. Stop! Why did we stop here? It's such a balmy night and it was stifling in the car. - But why here...? - Well actually... Oh I see. Good evening. I'm surprised to see you here, Mr. Novak. I beg your pardon? I thought you never go out. I'm sorry, this must be a mistake. But you are Mr. Novak? - Yes. - From our travel bureau? No no, I'm Kristian Novak. Our Mr. Novak's brother. I've heard much about you. I'm Kral, director of "See the World". - Pleased to meet you. Director Kral, this is... Your wife, I know. I noticed Madame at our office. But don't let me keep you. We just thought we'd go in for a while. A desperately dull place, I warn you. I've just fled. To the Orient, maybe. We just came from there, shall we go back for a while? Oh no indeed. But let's find another place, if Madame isn't too sleepy. Sometimes I just love not sleeping at night. Fine. So where... Where shall we go? - How about going to our place? - Where? To our house, how about that? If it wouldn't bother you... I'd love to talk to Mr. Novak about his brother. If it isn't too boring for you. I love to talk about my brother-in-law. We talk about him all day sometimes, right, Kristian? - Yes, we do. - Call a taxi. Such a fine night, why don't we walk? - It's not far, darling, is it? - Not far to the Orechovka quarter? That's no problem. Here is my car. Whiskey's a fine drink but after a bit I don't like it. The first two weren't bad, but I can't get the third down. So out with it. Where does Kristian Novak live? - At home. - Yes, but where? At his place, of course. Let's have another drink! No, it tastes like carbolic to me. My bill! - Please let me settle that. - No, I pay for myself. - All right, I'll pay. - I'd take offence! - All right, if you insist... - Unless I pay next time. Right, I'm paying tonight. - But for everything. - For everything. In that case I'll have one more. K. Novak, liqueur factory, located at Prague 15, Klimesova 10. After a fourth whiskey I may start liking it. - What is it you wanted of me? - Kristian Novak's address. Why not say so at once? Write it down. - Write, Peter... - Do, Peter... K. Novak, liquor factory, Prague 15, Klimesova 10. What are you waiting for? - Me? How's that? - Unlock the door, darling. Of course, I should... Where did I put the keys. You're so scatterbrained. Didn't you forget them at home, did you? Susie, that's me, I'll never change. Take mine from my handbag. Oh, I see. Here they are. That's for you, not... for you. Sorry. What's wrong with you today? Give me the keys. Excuse me for a moment, Kristian will look after you. Here are the hangers... And now this way. The pantry. What panties? No, I said - your pantry. - Oh it's... - Yes, very nice. This way, then. I mean here, sir. Excuse me, I... that's... What are you doing, Kristian? Come into the sitting room. I was showing him around... Please follow me. Nice, isn't it? Nice place we have, huh? Sorry, I pat myself on the back. You're right, who was an architect? Ah, what's his name, Susie? Architect Kucera of course. - Do you know him? - No. - You don't? Well, him. - Do take a seat. Bring the glasses, darling. - Glasses. Wine glasses. Just a second. What's this supposed to be?! There were always glasses here and suddenly records! Do calm down, darling. Glasses are in the other cupboard. Why are they there, when they should be here? My apologies. Anyway, where is she? - Who? - The maid! We want coffee! Have you forgotten? She went to her grandmother's. - Oh, to her grandmother's... - Bring the wine, darling. - Where is it? - In the refrigerator! Forgive me, but tidiness is the one thing I have in common with my brother. It always makes me mad if things aren't in place. That's Kristian all over. He knows the whole world but where things are at home, he doesn't know. Travel must be in the family. With the difference that he really travels but his brother only through our bureau leaflets. Never a dull moment in your home! The dog will never get used to me. Susie, would you get the wine? All right. What if there's another dog there?! I wanted to ask you to do me a kindness. - But of course, sir. - It concerns your brother. My brother. Yes, Alois. I'm going abroad tomorrow and named him my deputy. And he didn't even tell me. Yes, he starts tomorrow. How generous of you, but Alois doesn't deserve it. No no, he is one of my best people. But what he needs is a bit of your charm. More personality. Thanks. Do you smoke? Yes. Here we are... Ah, where... So yesterday I had.... - Here. - Thanks. Thank you, goodbye. How mean of you, now it's getting good here you close. Where shall I go? - Home, sir, home. - That's right. - Good night. - G' morning. At your service, boss. How much would it cost to Taborska St. on Letna hill? About 15 crowns, boss. - And to the bottom of the hill? - Ten crowns. So I'll have to climb that hill on foot. To the bottom of Letna hill. Yes, boss. To your happy return and successfully closed business. And I wish your brother success. I'll tell him. I shan't keep you any longer, it's been a delightful evening. Please put the dog in the kitchen, dear. What if he bit our guest? Just our guest? Just a minor point concerning your brother. I don't mean that your brother doesn't dress well, but as my deputy, you see... If you'd kindly give him this, I hope he won't take offence. I'm sure he won't. To represent the firm, right? Yes. Well put. I'll give it to him. I'll just take a look... All's clear... Why take your coat, darling? I'll walk a little way with our guest and I mustn't catch cold, as you know. Goodbye, and au revoir. When I get back, you must come and see us. - Delightful. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - The key to the house! - Goodness, I... Your Kristian will cost you dear. "It's our tenth wedding anniversary but you enjoy the night-club more than me. Don't look for me, you'll never find me. I'm at my Auntie's. Marie. " Why did I drink that stuff? And then that hill to climb. I hate that man. If I get my hands on him... You gave me Mr. Novak's address. You wanted it. But you forgot to say Novak's a liquor producer - and he's been dead for 6 years. - You don't say! And you forgot to tell me about their 3 mad bulldogs! That's fraud, sending people to the wrong address and taking money for the info! I'm going to see your boss, you'll get the sack for this! Goodbye! Likewise. Your wife is not with us. Aunt Anezka. Marie isn't here. Aunt Bozena. A gentleman to see you, sir. Send him in. Thank you. Good morning. Are you Mr. Novak? Yes, I am. Mr. Kristian Novak? Let's say you're right. You know what happens now? - I don't know. - You know nothing at all! - Me? No. - You get into my life to make me lose Susan and now you know nothing! Nothing. Stand up! Please, don't make a scene here. - I said stand up! - All right, but quietly. Just walk around! - Where to? - Just walk about here. If it makes you happy. Why am I to walk around? I'm trying to see why Susan finds you alluring. Don't bother watching me walk, because I talked to her sitting down. - And I'm not alluring at all. - I agree with you there. But seriously now. Make your choise. Marry Susan or break up with her. I'll definitely not marry her. I love my wife. The gentleman wants to see you. We haven't finished yet. Please step in there for a moment. All right. But I shan't let you run off. I certainly don't mean to. I discovered your address! You are Kristian Novak. - What can I do for you? - I'll tell you what. You stole my friend Fred's girl, Susan. No I didn't. Yes you did! I did. I want to thank you for that. - I don't understand. - Let me explain. I'm sure you'll give up Susan if I ask you to. How noble of you to come and plead for Susan's return into the arms of your friend Fred. Who said into Fred's arms? I mean into my arms. What? I've been tagging along with them for six months. I love Susan, I am just waiting for them to part so I can have her to myself. What if I give her up and she returns to Fred? That's what may not happen. Fred is a fool, mentally limited, an inferior person. Fred's not suitable for such a girl like Susan. So I need your help and advice. Well, there is one solution. There's a gentleman to see you. I said you were busy, but... I'll be free in a moment. So what's your solution? It'll be simple, but startlingly effective. Please, come. Would you step in there, please? - I'm Dvoracek, lawyer. - What can I do for you? I'm here on a delicate matter. - Please take a seat. - Thank you. It's about Susan Rendlova. Another suitor? Well don't worry. I'm finishing with her. That won't help, it's too late. - How's that? - I represent your wife. Excuse me, but which wife? I'm getting a bit mixed up. Your wife Marie. She is at her aunt's and is applying for divorce. What? Marie? That's impossible. Don't let me intrude, gentlemen. Excuse me, but this lady... it's a very urgent matter. Could I see you again today? That's possible, tonight. I'll be at the Orient Club after 10 p. m. The Orient Club? Couldn't it be elsewhere? Sorry, no. I'm meeting a client there. We could have a little talk. If it suits you, in the room at the back. - The Mocca Salon. - Is there a separate... Yes, we shan't be disturbed there. Will you come? - Definitely. - Good. Quite definitely. - Just a moment. - Yes? Seriously, couldn't it be somewhere else? Unfortunately not. So tonight in the Mocca Salon. But... Why are you here? I love your brother. What? Yes, I love your brother Kristian. That's not possible, you hardly know him. I've known him all my life. I waited for him all my life. I always thought it difficult to fall in love. And now I see how simple it is. I thought that in order to laugh one had to have cause for laughter. And in order to cry, one had to have cause for tears. And now I could laugh or cry just for him. Just because of him. Isn't it wonderful? No. I mean yes. Wonderful. And now I don't know where to look for him. I haven't seen him since yesterday. Please give up my brother. Do you think he doesn't love me? I warned you about him. And then, Kristian is married. What did you say? His wife left him because of you. You broke up a happy marriage. I didn't know he was married. You said he was an adventurer. Not that much of an adventurer, he only gets occasional attacks. Please give up Kristian. I can't. I love him too much. I knew nothing of life before. He opened my eyes. When I met him, I felt with all my senses that he is the only man I could love. Have you heard him talk about tropical nights in Cairo? About murmuring palms, the sea singing its lullaby? What do you know about that, except from the leaflets at your travel bureau. While Kristian... No, I cannot give him up. His aura of mystery is so alluring. It's the scent of the unknown I am attracted to. I beg of you, on behalf of his poor wife, find yourself another Kristian. Find a man who'd tell you all the things Kristian didn't have the time to say, a man to fulfill the things that Kristian only promised you. Do you think I'll ever find him? Yes. In your case I'm quite sure of it. And now - please leave. Where am I to go? My life has no meaning. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I ask just one thing of you. - Yes? Give me back my house key. Here it is. - Thank you. - Au revoir. Oh, my. Well, Kristian? You see my brother was here and brought the key for you... Yes, he knew I'd be here. He wears the same cuff-links, he is incredibly like you, to the last detail, like the scratch on his hand from my bracelet. He is a most conceited person, who thinks he's the cleverest man in the world. But I'm not angry with Kristian. He opened my eyes, and I saw that the world can offer more wonderful things than tedious evenings with Fred. Thank you, Susan. You taught me a thorough lesson. But did I deserve so much punishment? You know that Kristian's adventures were quite innocent. But how will I convince my wife of that? I'll give you some advice. Alois is a ninny without energy. Kristian a rake wasting his energies. They are both no good at all. Find a third brother, someone between Kristian and Alois. I'm sure he'd convince your wife of his merits. And when I find the right man, may I call him Kristian? You may. I give you Kristian. He was my only treasure and you'll take it with you. Kristian will leave with you tonight. And I swear he'll never speak to anyone again. All right? Yes. - Goodbye, Kristian. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Kristian. Who is that lady? - I don't know her, sir. - Thank you. Madame, you dropped your handkerchief. - Me? No. - Really? I'm surprised. - Excuse me. - Oh, yes? - What can I do for you? - Exactly what I wanted to ask you. I beg your pardon? I happen to be the lady's husband. If you don't mind. Oh. No, I don't mind. It must be some mistake, my respects. - Excuse me, is this your wife? - Yes. So who was the lady you were here with last time? That's none of your business, sir. Yes, that's right. But it is wrong that you are deceiving your wife with this lady, however pretty she may be. Marie, you are so pretty! Please don't start crying. If only you knew... I do know, dearest Alois. Excuse me, you are standing on my handkerchief. Oh, has Madame dropped her handkerchief? Thank you. - May I join you, Madame? - Please do. - Thank you. At last! - Are you angry? - No. So you think I'm pretty? Oh my... - Alois dear, do you love me? - I love you. - Say it again. - I love you. - Do you know what I've done? - What? - I burnt the dominoes and slippers. - That's pure happiness! But I'd like to know one thing. - What, dear Marie? - If Kristian also... Hush. Kristian's disappeared. He's gone forever. But I'd just like to know... You must not ask about what was yesterday. Today is the best day of all... This never happened before. It's the first time Mr. Kristian is leaving with a lady. Yes, the first time. And I think he won't flee from her.
