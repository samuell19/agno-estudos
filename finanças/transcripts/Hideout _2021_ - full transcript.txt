[dogs barking] [Kyle] Let's get in the car. [gunshot] Get in the car. Is he bleeding? Is he dying? - Sarah. - What? What happened? What's going on. Shit, shit. [Sarah] Hang in there. Reed! Don't let me die. [Sarah] He got hit in the side. You were supposed to watch him! Goddamn it! The bullet didn't go through, there's no exit. Fucking idiots, we practiced this. Shut up, just drive! How was I supposed to know he had a gun? Did you kill him? What are you talking about? You shot back at the guy, Reed. What the fuck else was I supposed to do? We can't go to the hospital. We have to go to a hospital, Kyle. He's gonna fucking die, you asshole. - Rick! - What? Turn, turn, turn there. [Reed] I can't feel my toes. I can't feel my feet. Look at me, look at me, Reed, hang in there. You're not going to die, okay? You're gonna stay right here. [Rick] Where the fuck am I going? What are you doing? Go get them to open the door. [knock on door] Hello, help! [knock on door] May I help you? One of our friend's been shot, in the side. He's bleeding pretty bad, can you help us? Please. Bring him in. Bring him in. [Bee] Come on, get him in here. Hurry up. [Kyle] Get him down, get him down, get him down, come on! [Kyle] Fucking damn it, come on. [Bee] Get him down. The hell happened? We were hunting it was getting late, it was getting dark, we should've stopped a lot earlier, but we fucking didn't. I need to call an ambulance. No, no! Listen ... He doesn't want to go. I need to call an ambulance, [Bee] he's bleeding out. He doesn't have insurance. He doesn't want to go. Is there anything else that you can do? I have pliers and string. Rick, go get the first aid kit from the trunk. Yeah. [music] [branch snaps] Hello. Jesus fucking Christ! Just hold that. Goddammit! Shhh. It's gonna be okay, okay? Where the fuck is Rick? Goddammit! Rick! Rick! There is no kit and Rick is gone. [Sarah] What? He's fucking gone, Sarah, I don't know what you want me to tell you. Settle down. We have to get the bullet out. Hey, listen to me, buddy. Listen to me. [Kyle] Reed. Reed, look at me. This is gonna hurt, okay? But we're gonna do it, okay? Ready, on the count of three: one, two, three. [Kyle] Oh my God. Hold still. Easy, breathe. [Kyle] What the fuck. [Kyle] Oh my God. [Bee] Breathe! Breathe. [Bee] You have to be still. [Sarah] All right. All right. All right. [Kyle] Jesus fucking Christ, Jesus fucking Christ. Oh God, Oh God. Is he dead? No, he's fine. Jesus fucking Christ. He's gonna be fine. Jesus fucking Christ. [eerie music] [Rose] Did you let them in? [eerie music] He's been shot, Rose. Who are all you people? I'm Sarah. This is Kyle. Look, if we could just stay here tonight and rest, we'd be gone by the morning. We need to wait for our other friend, we need to find Rick, he should be back soon. Of course, honey, anything you need. Do you need to use the telephone to call someone? No, this will be best for us to just stay here tonight, and rest. Do you think he'll be okay? Yes, he's gonna be fine. But I would probably get him to the hospital tomorrow. Yeah. Well, y'all must be thirsty. We can't thank you enough. My pleasure. Are you all from around here? Yeah, well, not directly around here, but around the area. In the area. This is a very nice house. It was my grandfather's. It's very, uh ... ... classically sleek. Where's your grandfather now? [glass breaks] We don't get many guests. Oh, I'm sorry. Um I'm gonna go outside for a smoke. I'll go with you. Okay. You have a very pretty granddaughter. I wish I had some of those genes. That's Rose. She came to live with me a little while ago. I'm not doing so well. That's nice. You know, the way you handled yourself earlier was really good. I try my best. You remind me a lot of myself. You were probably really a good kid, huh? Yeah, I was. This is very good. Thank you. I've been making that lemonade my whole life. My father would walk me down to the lemon tree that laid on the property of our land and we'd pick those lemons and carry them back into the house and start squeezing. One day I wanted to go and he did not want to. And I threw a fit and he got mad. So he went in, you know, to his favorite chair and sat there, until he eventually fell asleep, just right by the window. It was his favorite chair. So I decided, being a little rebellious girl, that I was gonna go myself, and I did. And I really wish I hadn't. It was a very dangerous thing for a little girl to do, you know. So, but I went and, um ... I wish I hadn't gone. I regret going. I wish I had just stayed home. I don't think I've ever told anyone that before. I don't think you hurt your father. [Sarah] He's probably proud of you, making your own decisions. Maybe he was just hurt you were growing up. You know what I hate? What's that? The way nobody has any manners anymore, so rare. You have manners though. Oh, do I? I can tell a lot about you. Yeah? Like what? I know you want to fuck me. Well, that ain't hard to tell. I know you had a dog named Beans, when you were little. Excuse me? I'm a psychic. [Rose] Can I see your hand? Oh! What? Uh, it's nothing. [Kyle] What is it? It ... I ... What? What the fuck did you see? [laughs] Holy shit, you should've seen your face. I was kidding. Jesus, you're easy. Then how did you know about my dog? You have a bone key chain, with Beans written on it. Great. [Kyle] Cool. All right, let's go. [Sarah] How's everything going? Fine. Bee, we're gonna go check on Reed, we'll be right back. [Bee] Okay dear. He's breathing. No fever. You told them our real names. So, they've seen our faces, what does it matter what names we tell them? Do you think Rick left? I think Rick left. Fucking asshole. Where do you think he went? Who cares? Do you think they know? Who, them? Absolutely not. Why would they? Hey, no, I think they bought what we were selling. Right now, this is a perfect place to hide. Besides, if Reed's not in any shape, tomorrow we may have another day here. Shit! Battery is dead. [Kyle] How's your battery? Mine's almost dead. And I have no service here either, like literally nothing. [Weather Reporter] Midnight forecast. Thursday low of 60, high of 73 with clear skies. Wednesday low of 62 What is with you and that thing? You watch it all the time. So, what do you think of them? Harmless. Harmless. Harmless, harmless, harmless. [TV Reporter] Breaking news in the Tri-state area tonight. Just hours ago, there was an attempted armed robbery at a local liquor store. One employee is in critical condition tonight after an exchange of gunfire that took place inside the store. Now suspects are at large and are armed and dangerous. Police are asking residents to stay indoors and lock their doors and windows. Without any witnesses, information on the car driven by the suspects has not yet been identified. Although the armed robbers were wearing masks, one apparently dropped his cell phone at the scene. Police have so far been able to identify suspects involved through a slew of text messages, planning the robbery. Stay tuned for updates. This is Gail Scott- Key reporting. Please, what are you doing? [Rose] What are you going to do? Shoot us? I already told you you could stay here. Just don't hurt us, please. Shut up. [Kyle] I don't feel bad for you. Who opens her door to a stranger in the middle of the night? Are you for real, with this? Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not. That is some secret you're not sharing with us. Why don't you come a little closer and I'll whisper it in your fucking ear. [suspenseful music] Do I look like a fool to you? You have three seconds to put down the knife or I shoot you and this old bitch right here. Now, you want to save your grandmother's life, then shut the fuck up and put down the knife. Good. Now hands up. Into the living room one at a time. And when I say one at a time, I mean one fucking slow and steady time. [Kyle] Now we're just going to wait until this blows over. [eerie music] Hey, what the fuck do you think you're doing? Kyle. [Kyle] What fuck the is going on? I woke up to them both in the kitchen, they were talking. [Kyle] How long have you been awake? Did you call the cops? Are they on their way here? We didn't call anyone. What were we supposed to do, lie around until morning? You're the ones that fell asleep. [painful scream] Hey, what's going on with you? They're lying to us. No one knows we're here, Kyle. Stop it. We need to hide the car. Take her with you. I'm not going to try anything. [Sarah] Let's go. Hey, hey. What? You don't want them to find you, do you? Why didn't you do something? You had the chance. What do you mean? When you were in the kitchen, you could have called the cops, taking our guns, ran away. I could've slit your throats in your sleep. I thought about it. Not all of us are monsters. This is your fault. I didn't do this. If you would have just stayed put, we wouldn't have to be here. I'm locking them in the closet. Well, I could stay awake. They have pillows, they have blankets. They'll be fine. [Sarah] Oh, shit. Whatever you do, get rid of them. Do you hear me? Don't do anything stupid or he will shoot you in the head. [knock on door] [suspenseful music] Answer it. Good evening, Miss, I'm Detective Lopez. Hello, Officer, is there something wrong? Sorry to bother you. I don't know if you've heard, but there's been a robbery in the area. Right now me and my team were just checking door to door, and just seeing if anyone's seen anything suspicious. Intel's led us to believe that the four suspects are actually somewhere in the area still. Have you seen anything strange tonight? No, nothing. I wish I could help. [Detective] Okay well, again, sorry to bother you. If you see anything out of the ordinary, make sure to contact us and don't worry, we'll catch them. Have a good night, Officer. [glass breaks] My cat, he's terrible, always making a mess. Good night. Good work, team. I think it's time for bed. Maybe we should just leave. Leave? We can't leave, Kyle, we're being hunted. We have to stay here. We have to hide. Do you want to go to jail? I don't like them, Sarah. Now that they're out of state and out of mind, I really don't fucking like them. Maybe I should have pointed at another house, that I'm so sorry for not accommodating your preference of household family. Hey, look, now I know this is my stupid fault, and I'm sorry, but I got you and I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. You always were the best big brother. [eerie music] [banging] [banging] [banging] [banging] [eerie music] [eerie music] [Sarah] Hey! What is going on with you? [Kyle] There was a... What? There was... You're scaring me. The banging... There was banging. And you were gone. It was terrible. What do you mean I was gone, I've been asleep right next to you this whole time. Your face was cut off. Hey, you need to hold it together. I swear to God, Sarah, it felt so real. I was walking on my own two legs, and the noises woke me up. Maybe you were just sleepwalking or something. I have never sleepwalked in my life. Stress can cause a lot of strange things. I was awake. Okay ... Okay. Sarah. [Rose] He's fine. Can I use the bathroom upstairs? At least put on some deodorant. I smell like a Goddamn lumberjack. Did you hear that? She has to use the bathroom. And if she's not back in two minutes, I'm gonna kill you. How are you feeling? My fucking side hurts. Where are we? What's going on? You've been shot. Are they after us? [Sarah] Yeah, they know. They know what? They know who we are, we're all over the news. [TV Reporter] The liquor store employee now identified as 29 year-old, Michael Kuvan, who was hospitalized in critical condition, has now died from the gunshot wound he received during the attempted robbery. Now all suspects are still at large, still presumed armed and dangerous. Authorities are confident that they are closing in on them. We'll keep you updated on the minute by minute on the unfolding situation. Where's the money? Did we get the money? The giant sack of money from the safe. Where is it? Are you telling me we did all of this for fucking nothing. That one of us fucking killed someone for nothing. That I got fucking shot for nothing. [Reed] Hey! Hey, look at this. Look! You fucking assholes. What a mess this is. Who is this? [Kyle] She's the one who stitched you up. And if it weren't for her, you'd be dead. Dead? Bummer. [Bee] I'm Bee, this is my house, I live here. She stays here with her granddaughter. She's upstairs right now. It's just the two of them. [Kyle] It's been getting long enough. I'm regretting letting her go upstairs at all. Your time is almost up. Do you hear me? [Kyle] Rose, you have 20 seconds to get down here. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... Kyle, please. One. I swear the next time I'll... [gunshot] You know, they say chances are, you've already been in the place of your death. [music from upstairs] Haven't met her yet. Would be rude of me not to introduce myself. [music] I don't believe we've met yet. No. No, not officially. You must be Rose. Kyle's very angry. Why aren't you downstairs? You're all boring me. Well, you don't know me very well yet. I am not boring. You listen to me you fucking snake, you may be able to creep your way around them, but not me. This is not a game. From now on, you don't do a Goddamn thing unless I say so. I run the show now. Any questions? Why can't a girl dance in peace? Are we clear, you fucking bitch? [eerie music] [Rose] Crystal clear. We need to think of a plan. Where the fuck do you think you're going? Away from you. Is this because... You didn't have to murder her. You took it too far, way too fucking far. Oh man, are you gonna cry now? You're always so weak, making me do all the work. You know what? Why don't you do some of the work for once? Get rid of the body. Go get fucking rid of it. She's starting to smell. [Reed] I think she shit herself. You should've taken us more seriously. Did you do this? Hey, hey, you did this. Why did she have to die? Because you weren't playing by the rules. She should have let you bleed out. Maybe so, but she didn't. [eerie music] Kyle! Kyle! Sarah! Sarah! [Kyle] What are you doing? I... You. You were... We were just talking and you walked away. I thought you... I thought... I thought you... You were just... Can you just give me a minute, Kyle? Where do you want me to put her? Garage. What are you waiting for? Now, come on, let's go, do it. What the fuck? I'm starving, Do you have any fucking food? No. Well then, what do you eat? I've never seen a kitchen so bare. You don't have a piece of fucking bread in there? What do you think, Kyle? He doesn't like me very much. Yeah, I don't remember asking you a Goddamn thing. I read his palm last night, he didn't like it. Of course you did. You know, how did you morons manage to pick the one house with the biggest fucking weirdo in it? I can see the future. I can see the past. I can read yours if you like. No. Thank you. You know what, why don't you just shut up and stop whatever it is you're doing over there. Hey. Hey, cut it out you creep. Hey! Hey! [eerie music] You're all going to die tonight. [Kyle] I know what it looks like. A couple of crazies come into your house and kill your grandmother. And here you are an innocent, sweet young girl who will be saved. That's the way it's got to seem, huh? Isn't it? Well, I know what is going on, I can feel it. And it is some dark, dark shit. Jesus Christ, man, what are you blabbering about? Holy shit, let's not lose our minds now, man. [Kyle] I'm not losing my mind, I'm thinking perfectly straight. She's just a girl, Kyle. All right. This is just a house, we're the same as we were yesterday. It's the pressure. The pressure will make you crack. Now pull yourself the fuck back together, my friend. Where's Sarah? Watch her. You know, some people make up their own nightmares to distract them from the real ones. Don't move. I told you to watch her. Look, I'm not crazy. There's something going on in this house. Now I don't know if it's the house or the old woman or this girl, but something is going on, and I know you feel it too. We have to go. They are not who they say they are. We're leaving. We have to get out of here. - When? - Now. [Reed] Right now. [Kyle] No. [Reed] What do you mean, no? [Kyle] It's not safe. He's right. [Reed] Oh, I'm sorry. Do you guys need more time having fun exploring the fucking house. I don't mind if you leave now. Shut up. Kyle is right though, Reed. It's too dangerous in the daylight. Okay, fine. Sundown. [Reed] But when the night falls we had straight for the border. [Sarah] Sundown. [Sarah] Are you good? Yeah, I'm just great. [Kyle] This is not a good idea. [Sarah] Why not? It's too dangerous. Even if we leave now or daylight. We don't really have a choice now do we? The longer we stay here, the more they close in on us. We have to make a run for it tonight. In what car, Reed? They know the car we drive. [Reed] Where's your car? We don't have one. [Reed] Well, our car it is then. We leave at sundown. Tonight is the night. You're just afraid of your wound getting infected. Don't put us in danger due to your personal interests. After all we've been through, Kyle. You're like a brother to me. Thought we were a team. We always were a team, Reed, just not a very good one. Oh yeah. We're leaving tonight. Sarah and I already decided on it. So why don't you stop being such a pussy? You know what's coming, Kyle. She will be our downfall if we don't get rid of her. We need all the time we can get, and she's certainly not gonna help with that. We're already in too deep. I have to get rid of her before we leave. And don't tell your sister, she's not gonna like that idea. Well, you're going to have a hard time leaving without the keys. Do you think they'll come back? Who, the cops? Yes. I don't know, maybe. Probably not. Oh ... We're leaving tonight though, don't worry. Do you believe in God? Yeah. Yeah, I do. It's good to believe in something, to have faith. Do you believe in the devil? I've, um, never really thought about it. Well, if there's good, there must be evil, right? Night and day, light and dark. I suppose he's real too. Oh, he is, and he's not some red monster with horns and a tail. He could be the most alluring creature you've ever met. But people forget, he's just a wicked manipulative angel, and he used to be God's dearest. You, you've got to talk to him, he's out of his Goddamn mind. I'll talk to him. You want to know what? I don't care if you do, or if you don't, I'm getting out of here tonight. [Reed] Go check on the car and make sure it's good to go. When the night falls, I want to leave, immediately, got it? Yeah. How are things going in here? Fine. Hey, so what's going on with you? We have to get out of here, Kyle. We have to leave tonight. [Kyle] I don't agree with that. Why? When do you want to leave then? When would be a better time? It's not safe. Where? What's not safe? Out there, in the world. Ever since we got here, you've been acting so strange, but listen, I don't care about any of that because I love you. We've always stuck together, our whole lives. Please, don't leave me hanging now. I don't trust Reed, I never have. You're really concerning me, you know that? Yeah, whatever, um .. we'll leave tonight. Kyle. Yeah. Last night after I found you in the middle of the night after your dream, I couldn't sleep. There's something strange about this place. I told you. I was trying to stay awake, I thought about when we were kids and how you were always there for me. And even though we don't always act like it or say it out loud, most of the time, I know you love me. And why does that matter? I just wanted to share that with you, Kyle. I don't know, I thought you should know. You wanted to share. Yeah? I am tired of you screwing up everything. My whole life I had to clean up your messes. I'm ... I'm not. But, I'm under a lot of stress. And do you know what stress does to your body? It fucks with your mind. Do you know how hard it is to concentrate on this situation? I understand that, but... But, but, but, what? Huh, it's time you grew up. This is not my fault, this isn't Reed's fault, this isn't Rick's fault. This is your fault. And now you have to let me finish what we've started. I'm not blaming you for anything. I trusted you, I never blamed you. You love to blame me. We needed the money, Kyle, you know this. It was the only way to get the money fast. Mom needs the money. [eerie music] Mom is going to die, whether we can afford her treatments or not. [Sarah] Guys, we have a problem. The car hardly has any gas, we're not gonna make it. Yeah, I know what that means. Well, now we have to get gas before we go, like now. And how do you suppose to do that? We are all over the news. They've seen our faces. We will bring, her. She will go to the gas station, fill up the car and drive back and I will be laying in the back seat, making sure she does exactly that. Let's go. Kyle, give me money. I don't have any. Here, use my card. What do you mean, you don't have any money? Why don't you use her card? I dropped my wallet in the safe. You know what? We would have plenty of money if you're dumb ass didn't forget the fucking bag. You have nothing. You have absolutely nothing, Reed. [Kyle] You are nothing. This is why you dragged me and her into this bullshit. I should have known better. Fuck you. Hey. No, fuck you! Reed, stop. No, I get it, he's your brother. You love him, you trust him, right? And I'm just the asshole with the gun? Well, why don't you go ahead and tell her Kyle. Tell me what? [Kyle] Stop it. What he was planning on doing with his portion of the money. Shut up! What did he tell you? That he was gonna use it for your mommy? That that was the point of all of this? It was out of love, for your family. Well, he was never going to use it for that. You want to know what he was gonna use it for? A plane ticket to Florida and a brand-new pad. And, of course, lots and lots of drugs. Isn't that right, Kyle? [Sarah] You said that we were doing this for mom. You said that this was supposed to be simple, and that no one was gonna get hurt. I would have never gotten involved in this, and you know that. You lied. Kyle? Is this true? Now you have nothing too. Go ahead, do it. All these secrets people have, always been more about what they hide than what they show. You know, I've been thinking, you remind me of an ex-girlfriend I once had. You're a good girl, you know that, right? Pretty girl. Very pretty girl. Maybe I've been too hard on you. Maybe I should have been nicer to you. I still catch myself thinking about it, how I should've let you keep on dancing. I know you want me. I know you wanted me to see you dancing half naked up there. The way you didn't care that I was watching and the way you didn't care that I could have killed you right then and there. What was I doing up there anyways? It's like you ... It's like you called me up there or something. Anyways, what I'm getting at is, uh, we might have time for a quick motel stop. [music] [music] All we gotta do is fill her up, and we're good to go. What the... Pull over to the side of the road. Did we seriously just run out of gas? God! Pull over. Son of a bitch! Fucking piece of shit! What are we gonna do now? We have to get back to the house before someone sees us. Sees you. Did you do this? Are you trying to sabotage us? How would I have had a chance to get to the car without any of you seeing. What the fuck are we gonna do now? Shit. Shit. All right, okay, this is what we're gonna do. Maybe they don't know me. Maybe they didn't watch the news. We can just hitch a ride and get back to the house. Maybe. Listen, I will do the talking, all right? Don't say a fucking word, do you hear me? Do not open your fucking mouth. [Reed] Hey there. You need some help? We're just having some car trouble. We live a couple of miles up the road. So we're just walking back. I could give you a ride if you want. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Get in. [music] [Reed] Hey, thanks again for the ride, uh ... Marshall. Hey, no problem, I'm not in any rush today. [Marshall] So where are you coming from? Just a couple of miles up the road. Yeah? I've never seen you around before. Did you just move here? He is my boyfriend. We're taking the next big step and moving in together. I've been there a couple of times. Never again. Staying single forever. Hey, you know, my girlfriend's brother is a mechanic. I can give him a call. No, actually her dad is a mechanic. He lives around here. So, we're just going to give him a call, thanks. [Marshall] I was just offering. I hope it's nothing major. By the way, be careful outside, there's a lot of cops around, it's been in the news. What news? A few guys robbed a store and fled and it's just crawling with cops. Oh, wow, geez. We haven't been home much today so. I'm sure they're gonna catch them. Yeah well, we will have to keep our eyes peeled. Scary. [Reporter] We interrupt this broadcast with an emergency alert. Authorities are in lookout for a silver two door sedan, license plate number J eight... [radio clicks off] And the radio, that's all they do, is talk now. They should stick to just playing music. And their commercials, I don't listen to them anyway, ever. By the way, what's the make of your car? I think I had a similar one. Say what, it's a pretty good car. Oh, you know what? [Reed] What are you doing? I just gotta make a call, I'll just be a moment, you just sit tight. Don't fucking move. Listen, look, man, there's no need to call the cops. Back off. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Look, I'll turn myself in. I'm ready to do it. I never hurt anyone, I'm just embarrassed. Okay, okay, okay, okay, look, I'll turn myself in. You're right, all right. I'm ready to do it just... Please, man, all right. Let me do it with some dignity, all right. Let me turn myself in. All right. I'm just afraid. [music] I had a thought this morning. Something I want you to hear, I just don't know how to say it, so I'm gonna say it out loud. I hope to God that mom dies before she ever finds out what we've gotten into. There's two sides to a person, one is like a friend, someone you love, and the other side is a complete stranger. I'm sorry for lying to you. I know it doesn't matter now, but I'm sorry for hurting you and mom. Whether you believe me or not, I was going to use some of the money for mom's treatment, just not all of it, like we talked about. I'm sorry, Sarah. Our whole lives I should have been a better brother to you. We're gonna get through this, okay? What was that? What was what? That noise, didn't you hear it? I didn't hear anything, Kyle. It's like a banging. There's a banging noise. How can you not hear it? It's like some type of clatter. [suspenseful music] Your mother always loved Sarah more than you. [laughs maniacally] I know this because she told me. Don't take her from here, she needs me here. Don't take her. Was it a nice sunset? What's this? They're gonna be after us. We have to get out of here. Come on, let's go, now. Don't we have anything to tie her up with? I do apologize, but this is the way it has to be. Reed, come on, we can be better than this. Shut the fuck up, Sarah. Motherfucker. What? I need to go to the bathroom, go get the car, I'll be out in a minute. Yeah, take your time, why don't you. Give me a fucking second, would you? Can you stay with her until he comes out? Hey, everything's gonna be okay. Run, okay? Get out of here. Reed. [Reed screaming] [knock on door] Reed? Hey. [eerie music] [knock on door] [eerie music] [eerie music] [Sarah] Reed, open the door. Open the door. Open the fucking door. Reed! Open the door. Open the door. [banging] Reed, open the door. Open the door right fucking now. Open the fucking door. [eerie music] [hiss] Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! [eerie music] [Kyle screaming] Sarah! [glass breaks] Sarah. You should listen to your brother. Come out. I just want to talk to you. I know you're in there, Sarah. Why did you hurt me? Why did you do that? I'm bleeding. You stabbed me in the fucking eye. Go rot in Hell where you belong. I'm sorry, Sarah. I never meant to hurt you. I was doing you a favor. We don't belong here in this world. [Sarah] Maybe you don't but I do. Sarah. You're never getting out of here. We are gonna stay here forever. Open the fucking door, you bitch! How's that eye? [eerie music] Look what you made me do. I know about the clothes and the bones in the woods. Oh, the children? I was in a cult. The first ones were my baby brother and sister. I was supposed to be watching them while my parents were out but instead, I killed and ate them. My parents and the town suspected me of doing it. They suspected me of possessing some kind of evil, unimaginable evil. It put the fear of God in all of them. But they never found a trace of me. I never went home. I've been out here since 1893, moving from place to place, hiding. You're a monster. What are you going to do about it? No one would believe you, even if you had the chance to tell them. Are you really going to kill a young woman, in cold blood, in her own home? Yeah, something like that. [witch chant] [Kyle screaming] Where you're going, there's only darkness. [suspenseful music] Come out, Sarah. Don't be frightened. We hardly got a chance to know each other. I wanted to tell you more about the lemon tree. I know Bee started to tell you a story. Did you drop something, Sarah? Bee never got to apologize to her family and for going out to the lemon tree that day. She never got to see them again. She never got to go home. I abducted Bee when she was only a little girl. She was just a little girl. She's not my grandmother. I stole her away from her family. I was going to eat her but for some reason I decided not to. Instead, I raised her. More like a pet, really. But tonight I'm going to get to eat again, now that you're here, Sarah. I summoned you here. I brought you here. You didn't decide to come here, I did. This was no accident. Every decision in your life that you thought you made, brought you here, with me. I'm your only way out of here, Sarah. I'm your angel, come down from heaven, to save you. An angel, just like Grandfather. Come on out, Sarah. We'll have some lemonade. [eerie music] Stay. [laughing maniacally] It's too late. [screaming] [moaning] [banging on door] [groaning] [footsteps approaching] [eerie music] [low growling sound] [growling] [police radio] [TV Reporter] Disturbing new developments in this breaking story.
