Do you have the guts? This is not the beginning of the story, neither is this the ending. One-seven-three, it's your turn to fight now. If you're not going, I will. Everyone has a dream deep down in his heart. We all had an unforgettable experience while we pursued our dreams. We all have a story to tell about the dream we pursued. My name is Cheng Lin-dong, the protagonist of this story. I currently work as the practice mate... for Li Qi, the popular action movie star of Star Movies. I earn a measly sum of money from this job. Stop! Time's up! I punched you eighteen times within thirty seconds. Two punches more compared to the last time. Brother Qi, Mr Huang wants me to remind you that... you mustn't be late for the press conference tonight. All right, Brother Qi is going to attend a press conference, so that's it for today. One-seven-three, sign here. Hi, I would like to settle my pay check. What's your number? One-seven-three. One-seven-three? - Six-five-one-seven-three. - Present! You still have to clock five more times before you can settle your pay check. - May I get paid in advance? - No, you may not. Listen, Ke Lin, you have owed me a few months' rent, it's about time you pay. Madam Cheung, I'll bring it to you tomorrow. Not again? I don't have time to wait. Pay now or leave! This is all I have, please take it first. That's all? It's not even enough to pay for a game of mahjong! Ke Lin, why do you have to work from home? That's too tough. You should quickly find a rich guy and marry him. Why are you hanging out with this pathetic man... and living such a tough life? Lin Dong, why don't you find another job? Isn't this a good job? Look how good I am! It pains me to see your wounds. Ke Lin. I don't feel the pain and I don't want you to feel any pain. They say, if one wants to be successful, hang around successful people. I practice with the A-list star Li Qi every day. I'll also become a A-list star soon. I will give you happy life! It won't be long. I promise, trust me. Bring it on! Stop! - Next! One-six-nine! - Present! Can I have a stronger opponent please? - You! One-seven-three! - Present! I'm coming. Stop! Brother Qi. Brother Qi, I can continue. Very well! I want to go on... I want to go on! Everything is expensive these days... except the lives of poor people like us. I begged many friends for help and finally found a house like this. The rent is five hundred dollars per month. I tried every possible way to persuade the landlord... - before he agreed to rent it to you. - Kui, thank you! Liu, they are friends from my hometown. Please take care of them. Don't worry, I will take care of them since you asked. Pay this month's rent first. Sure. Lin Dong. Here it is. Here. Please take care of them. Aunt. Does that chap treat you well? Very well! We're moving to a new place today. Moving? Is the new place big? Hello... Yes, it is. Three bedrooms and a living room. Take good care of yourself. That chap is not reliable. All right, don't worry about me, Aunt. Take care. It doesn't matter to me. I will surely give you a house that has three bedrooms and a living room. Cut! Are you too used to being practice mate... that you forgot how to spar? Looks like you're fated to be bashed up. Director, may I give it a try? Brother Qi, what do you think? - Go ahead. - Thank you. - Get ready. - Get ready. - Action! - Action! Old Town Flavor Hot Pot Ke Lin, tuck in. You should eat more! You need a lot of energy being a stunt man. Ke Lin, which super star do I look like? Oh, Bruce Lee! Listen, I'm no longer a practice mate. I'm promoted to a stunt man now. I think I'm beginning to see the hope of becoming a super star. I'll make sure you live a very blissful life! All of a sudden, the city seems particularly beautiful to me! That's because I'm carrying you on my back. I am a super star. Bruce Lee! Let's get his autograph! It's Li Qi! Let's get his autograph! Please say a few words. Mr Huang, could you please tell us the title of the next movie... which you have invested over one hundred million dollars. - Our next movie... - Mr Huang, it's confidential. We can't disclose it yet. Right, I can't tell you. Brother Qi... - You can make a guess. - Will Li Qi star in the movie? Brother Qi, will you be the lead actor? - Of course it will be me. - Cheng Lin-dong! Cheng Lin-dong! Kui, I've told you, haven't I? I've changed my name to Cheng Feng. Don't call me my old name in front of other people. - Do remember that. - Cheng Lin-dong? Brother Qi, could you tell us about the role you'll be playing? A murderer. A murderer? What sort of a murderer? No comments. Stop... Brother Qi... Brother Qi... Are you looking for me, Brother Qi? - Brother Qi. - What's the name of your friend? I have many friends. Which one are you referring? The one you were talking to at the set. I see, you mean Cheng Feng. I don't think you called him that name earlier on. Oh, I called him Cheng Lin-dong. Sometimes, fate has a knack for playing tricks on people. Reincarnations do happen around us. Nineteen ninety-three, thirty-first of March, the actor playing opposite Brandon Lee, the son of Bruce Lee... held a prop gun pointing at Brandon Lee as according to the script. He fired a shot at Brandon Lee and Brandon Lee fell to the ground. Brandon Lee then bled profusely. He couldn't be saved and died. Bruce Lee was the king of action films. Twenty years after his death, the Grim Reaper came for his son. Sir, if you want to buy it, I'll wrap it up for you. More than eighty thousand dollars? I'm just browsing today. I will buy it next time. Robber! My bag! Get the robber! Get the robber! Freeze! Freeze! It's you! You need money and resort to robbing? Give me the bag! Stop... Stop... What's wrong with Qi? It's just a sideshow but he fought furiously. Something's amiss. - Did they change the script? - I have no idea. Cheng Feng... You're bleeding! You call this filming a movie! This is practically murder! Brother Qi says we should fight for real. Fight for real? You must be kidding! If someone gets killed, who will be responsible? Li Qi, we're just filming movie. You can't fight for real. That bloke has been a practice mate, so he's used to taking punches. If not, he would have been killed. Speaking of this, Cheng Feng is really tough. The reporters praised you for your performance today. You have Cheng Feng to thank for. Cheng Feng? All right, smile. Come on, smile. Look here, change another pose. Perfect! Come on! Lin-dong, look! OK, smile. Change another pose. Good. Give me a blissful smile. Show me more happiness! Good. Keep smiling. Great! Ke Lin, I will give you happiness. You can bet on it. Director, Brother Qi, I am ready. This scene is very important. We're counting on you! When the wire pulls you up, straighten your legs. You're my double, so you're representing me. No problem! You're ready to go. All right. Let him down. Okay. Guys, it's been tough on you. Have some water. It's been tough on you. Here. Have some water. Can't you see we're busy? - Miss. - Get lost! All right. - He's my buddy. - You're ready to go. Brother Qi, Cheng Feng is smaller in built. Will he ruin your image? You don't have to worry about that. You must trust my camera sense and my style of directing. Cheng Feng will surely suffer this time. He's ready, Director. Break a leg. All right, get ready. Roll. Three, two, one. Action! OK, this is what I want to see. Let him down. Director, the wire is going to snap! Director, the wire is going to snap! Come and take a look! - What's the matter? - The wire is going to snap. Is that how you do your job? Didn't you pay any attention to safety? Luckily Kui found out, otherwise someone might get killed. Who wants to be responsible for that? Be careful. Hello. I've got Brother Qi's autographed photos. I'm on my way there now. - Get ready the money... - You and you big mouth. Why did you hit me? Who are you? You should mind your own business! You're too nosy! - Beat him to death! - We can talk it over. You're too nosy! You deserve a beating! Kick him, guys! Stop! Kui! Kui, are you all right? Who are they? Why did they give you a thrashing? I don't know them. According to market survey, the audience has shown a lot of interest in Swallow Hero Li San. This movie will be a hit. This movie is the biggest investment of our company so far. I gather all the shareholders and higher management personnel here today... to discuss whom to be the lead actor from the movie-goers' point of view. We feel that Li Qi is a good choice. He is very popular lately and he has many fans. But he's not suitable to play this character. Swallow Hero Li San grew up in a poor family, and he was in a triad gang. Li Qi's disposition is very different from the character. Everyone, being convincing is key to making a movie. I've worked with Li Qi for many years. I'm certain that he can play the character Li San well. I agree with Mr Li. It's a fact that the audience like Li Qi to act as a tough guy. If he changes his on-screen persona to act as an ordinary man, can the audience accept that? It's a risk to do so. How about hiring a new actor? Hiring a new actor? Who? I have a feeling they're going with Cheng Feng. Is everything ready? Brother Qi, rest assured I'll get him this time. Let's do a test run. Ready? The wire is ready. Go. Go higher... Okay. All right. Ready? Three, two, one! Let go! - Okay! - Qi'er, slow down. It's been hard on you. How are you? All right, get ready. Every unit, get ready. Every unit is in place. Action! Is he all right? He should be fine. I'll check it out. Are you okay? - Are you all right? - Get lost... What's the matter? One more time! Get ready! On the double! Three, two, one. Roll and action! Cut! Doggy, slow down. Be good. My dear, are you okay? My darling. - Take care of her. - Sure. Come in. Mr Huang, Cheng Feng is here. Mr Huang, how are you doing? - Bring me the card. - All right. Have a seat over here please. Please take a seat. Are you feeling better now? I am fine. You're indeed a martial arts practitioner. If people like us were to meet with an accident, it's certain that we couldn't react so quickly. Mr Huang. There is a value of eighty thousand dollars in this card. This is for you. Thank you, Mr Huang. I didn't save your daughter for money. Mr Huang is going to sign a contract with me. I can finally give you a comfortable life. I remember you once told me that... once you're set on your goal, your lucky charm will appear. So I must thank my lucky charm, Mr Huang! I am going to become a superstar at last! Lin-dong is going to be a star! Lunatics. Ke Lin, quit your job tomorrow. It's too tough. I am not used to life without a job. The fact that you suggested that, I'm content. Done. Put this on and you'll look even more dashing. I won't look dashing without it? Sure! You look great! You look your best today! You're the handsomest man on earth! This is awesome. Expensive cosmetics. It feels great to be a superstar. Lift up your head. Look confident. One's confidence shows in one's smile. Your company is a well-reputed one in the movie industry. Why would you sign a newcomer like Cheng Jie? We need new faces for the movie industry. Our company has no qualms about giving newcomers a chance. Moreover, our board of directors have faith in Mr Cheng. Don't you agree? Yes... I'll let you in on a secret. Mr Cheng Jie is an orphan. He was trained in a martial arts school... whose skills were once gone for a few centuries. It's named Tien-ji School of Martial Arts. I believe you haven't heard of it. But, don't worry, you'll see Mr Cheng's skills in his future endeavors. He's very confident to show you... who's the real kung-fu superstar in Chinese movies. They didn't mentioned his name at all. Cheng Jie is Cheng Lin-dong. He changed his name again! Lower your voice. This is what "packaging" is all about. It's an unwritten rule. You won't understand. Why didn't he tell me? Mr Cheng, Mr Huang mentioned Tien-ji School. How is it like? We haven't heard of it before. That's right... Does it even exist? Can you comment on that? - Please comment on that. - It's... Well, about two hundred years ago, which was during the reign of Jiaqing, the imperial court rounded up troops from three provinces... in order to suppress the rebel armies. The rebel armies were outnumbered, so they retreated to the forest... Liar! He is not Cheng Jie! He is Cheng Lin-dong, the murderer who killed my brother. Li Qi, you should reflect on your own actions... since the company terminated your contract. Security, drive this drunken man out! Remember his face. He killed my brother. He is a murderer! Cheng Lin-dong, you are a murderer! You're nothing but a murderer. You've signed a contract with a murderer! You're a murderer! Mr Cheng Jie, is he telling the truth? - Yes, is he? - Is that true? Is that true? Please comment on that. That is libel! We terminated the contract with Li Qi due to his conduct. He feels indignant... so he's telling a lie to frame Cheng Jie. How can you trust the words of a drunken man? Time's up! Cheng Lin-dong! Get out here, murderer! Get out here! Li Qi, what do you want? Retaliate! Get up and beat me! Aren't you a murderer? Why don't you kill me too? I didn't mean it! The competition ended, yet you punched my brother. How could you say you didn't mean it? I was punched at the ear so I couldn't hear the bell. I wouldn't kill your brother just for a role in a film! I was put behind bars for seven years. I was in penance every single day. You took my brother's life. And now, you took away everything I had. From the moment I knew that you're Cheng Lin-dong, I'm never the same again. You know something? The snapped wire, Kui being beaten up, and you being my double I was behind them all. But you didn't die. Who would expect that you would save Mr Huang's daughter... and become a star! What the hell! In order to kill me, you didn't care about the lives of others! I don't care! I want to kill you! You're crazy! Have you lost your mind? Yes, I have! Please forgive me. Mr Huang, that's Cheng Jie's place. See if he is at home. All right. - Cheng Lin-dong... - Kui, you're here. We have pacified the media. And the company will organize a competition for you. We've invited highly-skilled martial arts practitioners from all over the world... so that you can showcase your skills. I won't participate. Cheng Jie, knowing kung-fu alone is not enough if you want to be an actor. You must learn how to divert the media's attention. The competition is the best vehicle to do that. Congratulations to Mr Cheng Jie... for defeating all the kung-fu masters from all over the world. - Cheers! - Cheers! I believe Mr Cheng Jie is the next kung-fu movie super star after Bruce Lee. I hereby announce... Cheng Jie to star in our next blockbuster Swallow Hero Li San... that has the budget of over one hundred million dollars. - Congratulations! - Thank you, Mr Huang. Thank you for all your support. I believe that in the movie Swallow Hero Li San, you will see the real power of my kung-fu. Great! Cheers! Cheers! Come on! We have a special guest with us today. She has just graduated from American Film Institute. She's also the niece of Mr Huang. Please welcome Miss Alice. Wow, she is sexy! My hero, may I have your autograph please? Please pass me a pen. Where should I sign? How about here? Just kidding. Sign on my back. Come on. Are you sure? Sure. Don't open your eyes. Here we are. - What do you think? - Is this the house... Mr Huang bought for you? It's much bigger than your dream house of three bedrooms and a living room. I like your old hairstyle better. It doesn't look nice? I'm a star, so I have to make changes. I will earn a lot of money in future. I will buy you an even bigger and more luxurious house. Ke Lin, I also want... Lin-dong, I don't need these things, you know that. I need you. You're the only thing I need. Ke Lin, I will give you happiness. Mr Huang. Please have a seat. Who is she? She is the cleaner. Cleaner? You were getting intimate with your cleaner. Cheng Jie, don't forget. You've signed a contract. Without the permission of the company, you cannot be in a relationship. Even if you're going to have a girlfriend, you can't fall in love with a cleaner. These days, people place importance on finding a mate that has equal status. You're not an ordinary man anymore. You're a superstar! Moreover, you're the spokesperson for a fashion label. You're answerable to the company and the investors for your actions. Do you get it? Here are the details of the advertisement you're going to shoot with Alice tomorrow. Study it well. Forget about intimacy with a woman. Okay, I got it. Cut! What's wrong with you? You just have a few lines to deliver, yet you can't get them right! It should be, "True love, Gentleman Gang." Set up the lights. The cast can take a break. - Cameraman, please play it back for me. - All right. Kui, was I very stiff? Not at all. You did very well. - Here. - I can pour water for myself. No... You are a big-shot movie star now. I should do that for you. Otherwise, you don't need an assistant, do you? - Here. - Hi. Let me do it. Hero, have I offended you in some ways? No. They are looking at us. Can you keep a distance from me? Do you hate me? No. It's just that I... If you don't... Shall we have dinner tonight? I can't do it tonight. No excuse. You can't say no. - Please enjoy. - Thank you. Cheers! Hey... - Cheers! - Okay. My uncle is very rich. People are dying to have him invest in their productions. My uncle listed one condition. From now on, all of the films he invests will star the two of us. When you are with me, you have to focus your attention on me. You're not allowed to do other things. Come on, let's drink! Tuck in. It's a wrap! Pack up and go home. Alice, what is this? It's a gift for you. You shouldn't have. Come on, given our relationship, I should! Open it. For a woman, her handbag says it all. For a man, it's his watch. A man who has good taste must wear this world-famous watch. Look, my handbag is a limited edition. This is too expensive. I can't accept it. It's a gift from me. You have to change your cell phone too. It looks great. It's over three thousand dollars! It's not expensive! Try it on. - Miss, let her try it on. - Sure. Lin-dong. Lin-dong. You are so beautiful! I'm showing too much skin! No. you're not. This is sexy! Take this handbag to go with your dress. I don't want it. For a man, his watch says it all. For a woman, it's her handbag. This is a matter of taste! You don't get it. Miss, I want all of these items. Isn't he Cheng Jie? A superstar! May I have your autograph? Your autograph please, Cheng Jie. Hold them for me. No pushing please. Slow down. I'll sign for you one by one. Be patient. Here. This is yours. No pushing please. Be patient. Easy... All right. It's your turn now. Be patient. Easy. Kui, which one is it? All right, I found it. Hi, how are you? I am Alice. I know. Lin-dong isn't home. Lin-dong? I mean Cheng Jie. He is not at home. I didn't come for him. I came for you. Listen, he isn't whom he used to be anymore. If you continue to be with him, you'll just be a burden to him. If you have his interest at heart, leave him. Don't forget. You are merely a cleaner. The two of you belong to two different worlds. It's raining cats and dogs! Here. Let's go. Watch your steps. Wait a minute. I saw dirt near your eye. Welcome. Mr Cheng, you came fast! The ring you ordered is ready. Sorry to make you wait for half a year. Thank you. Can we take a picture, Mr Cheng? Not today, we'll do it some other day. Mister, see you again. Welcome. - Miss, good afternoon. - Good afternoon! - May I know where room number one is? - It's over there. Thank you. Ke Lin. Lin-dong, let me introduce. This is my boyfriend. How do you do? Is this a joke? No, it's not. I mean it. We have been seeing each other for half a year. We are getting married. I didn't have a chance to tell you. That's impossible! Why not? What went wrong between us? You can't give me the happiness I want. He is different. He understands me and he gives in to me. Don't I understand you? Don't I give in to you? Everything I bought for you is branded! Ke Lin, I am a star now. Don't you think I can give you everything you want? A star? You have been a star for quite some time now. How many times have we been together? Every time we meet, we meet surreptitiously. When we do see each other, you shower me with gifts and that's it. You didn't ask whether I was happy or whether I liked that. Ke Lin, I know I have neglected you. But everything I did I did it for our wonderful future! Don't go on, Lin-dong. Don't tell me about the wonderful future. I have heard enough of that. Ke Lin, we've been together for ten years. Are we going to end it just like that? I don't want it to end. But I want to be married. I want a stable life. Your dream has come true. But what about mine? I've wasted my ten years on you. How long more do you expect me to wait? I can't wait anymore. I just can't. Ke Lin... Ke Lin... Ke Lin. I know you're lying. I know you have nothing to do with that man. Why? Why are you doing this to me? I just don't get it. You are a superstar. Why are you so hung up on that cleaner? Say no more! Look at you! Ke Lin, I want nothing more than to hold your hand and not let you go. But I just can't do it! You have no idea how hard it is for me to choose between love and my dream. Don't blame me. Hero... You still have me. Ke Lin. Thank you... There is a very good saying. Your success is where your heart is. I made it at last. I used to only wait to be picked. But now, I can choose to practice with whomever I want. Follow me to the scene to watch Cheng Jie in action! Every of his movies is well-received and breaking box office records. Mr Cheng Jie, can you tell us about your relationship with Alice? Sure. - Tell us. - Really? She's my partner. My lifelong partner. You'll always have our support! Our relationship is like my real kung-fu. Starring kung-fu Fighter Jet Cheng Jie and sexy goddess Alice, the filming of this year's greatest action film Swallow Hero Li San... officially commence now! We intend to screen this film all over the world. We want Kung-fu Fighter Jet to be known all over the world. Mr Cheng Jie, how do you prove that you can enter the international market? I am Kung-fu Fighter Jet, that's how. His fists are like missiles. Wherever they hit, everything will turn to ash. I'm telling you, the moves are awesome. They will look great. He's awesome. Look. Mr Peter, why do you want to challenge Chinese kung-fu movie stars? I am furious! I despise those action movie stars... whose skills are helped by wires and special effects. I am the real kung-fu movie star. I have been the free combat champion in America for five consecutive years. Have you heard of Kung-fu Fighter Jet? He claimed that his fists are like missiles. Wherever his fists hit, everything will turn to ash. He is over confident! Mr Peter, will you go to China and challenge Kung-fu Fighter Jet? Yes, I will. I will challenge whoever claims himself... to be the master of kung-fu in the movie industry. I will show them what real kung-fu is. What's your take on Chinese kung-fu and Bruce Lee? I respect and adore Bruce Lee. He showed the world the spirit of martial arts and Jeet Kune Do. But now, all Chinese kung-fu are sheer nonsense. What do you want to tell China's Kung-fu Fighter Jet? I want to turn that fighter jet into a tractor! That guy is too cocky! Cheng Jie should teach him a lesson. Peter is only a puppet! Someone is behind this. It's clearly to create media hype. Don't fall into their trap. You worry too much. Peter is challenging Chinese kung-fu and Chinese action movies openly. I just can't taking it lying down! Precisely! If I knew kung-fu, I would beat him to death. Cheng Jie, you have my support! I've read Peter's profile. He is really something. He knocked down a world champion with only two punches once. Cheng Jie is something too. If he's to eat the humble pie, how does he answer to his fans and the media? That's right. Cheng Jie, take him on. - Take him on! - No. He can't. - Take him on! - No. He can't! Be quiet! May I ask you one question? If Peter didn't appear, what should we be doing now? We would be devoting every effort to filming Swallow Hero Li San. Then came Peter and we panicked. How can we face bigger challenges in future? Yes. You're right. Mr Cheng, how do you plan on taking on Peter's challenge? Peter is so cocky. - Don't you want to teach him a lesson? - No comments. The media calls you "Savior of Chinese Action Movies". Peter looks down on Chinese kung-fu and Chinese action movies, but you're acting all cowardly. I think you don't fit to be called Kung-fu Fighter Jet. That's right. What a disgrace. I will take him on! You're over confident! You bypassed me and the company to make your own decision. That's because I know I can beat him. He is only a paper tiger. Once I defeated him, we can make use of this opportunity... to create hype on an international level. It will be good promotion for myself, the company, as well as our movie Swallow Hero Li San. What if you lose? If you lose, you will lose your fans and your value. You'll lose your glory. Can you afford the compensation for breaching the contract? Can you pay the loss the company suffers? I'm telling you, you will have nothing! I'm the person who cares the most about your best interest. It's not too late to give up the challenge. Ridiculous! You called me Kung-fu Fighter Jet, didn't you? I've defeated many masters from different schools of martial arts! Peter is nothing! You... Listen, that competition was a publicity event... organized by the company. We paid them to lose. Do you think you're really invincible? Let it sink into your thick skull! Fine! I'll show you what I've got then! You're my hero. Make sure you're a winner. Hero. Do you have the guts? Dear audience, we finally found the place where they're having the duel. We see that Peter has defeated Cheng Jie. Peter is leaving the scene as the victor. Cheng Jie looks like a pile of scrap metal. Lin-dong, Alice has gone to America... and will never return. The movie company has terminated your contract. Brace up. Can drinking solve the problem? Leave me alone! Get lost... Stop drinking! The old Cheng Lin-dong had guts! He killed someone and was put behind bars for seven years. But he didn't give up his dream. Look at you now! I have nothing now! Do you know that? Do you know that? You're not the only one who has a past. Everyone meets with obstacles along the way! Not everyone has everything going smoothly for him. A person like me didn't lose faith in life! But you? You became despondent just because you met with one setback! You're Kung-fu Fighter Jet, aren't you? What happened to your fighting capacity? You're a hero if you stand on your feet again! If you can't, you are nothing! Lin-dong, I heard that your dad is seriously ill. Go home and see him. Dad. Dad. Are you trying to drive me to my grave? I wanted you to live a stable life with Ke Lin. But you chose to be a movie star. Is that the life you should live? Ke Lin, we will be like these locks. We'll be together forever. Sure! I now understand that everything you did was for my own good. I'm glad you're back. Brother Lin-dong, tune in to the TV now. There is news about you. - Hurry, Brother Lin-dong. - Really? Hurry... Hurry! I came to Shanghai to promote my new film. Mr Peter, will your new film... feature the challenge between you and Cheng Jie last year? Cheng Jie presents zero value in my film. I defeated him. He is not fit to be in my film. He lacks the skills, courage and fighting spirit... Kung-fu movies originated in China. However, tell me how many outstanding kung-fu movies... are produced by the Chinese? Audience these days love movies that feature real kung-fu. Whereas the movies you Chinese made are nothing but special effects. My films are real kung-fu movies. Kung-fu is the quintessence of the Chinese culture. It is the spirit of the Chinese people. I want to challenge you. Kid, see how I take you down! Hit me now! Anyone else? Whoever wants to challenge me, come to me! Come to me! I'll take on any challenge you pose! Dad. A penny for thoughts. I am thinking why people have worries and cares. Tell me, why are there so many stars in the sky? The sky is big enough to accommodate all the stars. Human beings are the same. When you have a strong heart, you do not have fears. Hello, everyone. I am Kung-fu Fighter Jet whom Peter defeated last year. My real name is Cheng Lin-dong. My father is a farmer. I am not an orphan. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my dad who is very old now. He went through hardships to raise me. I was indeed a murderer. Ten years ago, I took part in a movie casting event. I killed my opponent Li Wu on the stage by mistake. I was put behind bars for seven years. I regretted for my action till this very day. I used to place too much importance on my personal fame and success. I've hurt too many people. I hereby offer them my most sincere apology. Also, I want to apologize to Mr Li Qi. I have a fiancée who is always by my side... and has made sacrifices for me for ten odd years. Her name is Ke Lin. I have this to say to her. Thank you and I love you! I called for this press conference today... for you to get to know the true me, the man the media coined as kung-fu Fighter Jet. I hoped to become a kung-fu movie actor since I was a child. I wanted to be like Bruce Lee. I wanted to spread Chinese kung-fu... to every corner of the world through movies. Today, I officially issue a challenge to Peter. I want to prove that the future can rewrite the past! Don't go. You are no match for him. Why did you fight him then? You're Chinese, I am Chinese too. I fought in the past competitions for my personal gains. But this time, I'm not just fighting for myself. Come on. You can do it... Faster. Faster. Come on! Hang on! Come on! Get up! Hurry! Come on! Show me your guts! Come on! You can do it! Remember, you must maintain balance. Four, three... Hang in there! Go on! Come on! Come on, Lin-dong! You're great! Does it hurt? You can do it... Kung-fu Fighter Jet will fly... and never give up until it achieves its goal! Come on! Don't give up! Hang in there and victory will be yours! May Kung-fu Fighter Jet fly again! Come on... We'll go along with your wishes for tomorrow's competition. No media interviews and no filming. All right. Thank you. - You're welcome. - I want to be alone for a while. Go home. All right. I wish you success tomorrow. It's been a while. This is a gift for you. Come... I want to go on! Lin-dong, clear your thoughts about the competition tomorrow. Just do your very best. Ke Lin, I suggest you don't watch the competition tomorrow. Okay. You're the one who understands me most. After going through many experiences, I finally understand that... living is not about proving oneself. More importantly, it's about helping others to achieve their goals.
