They don't have no profitable growth. I'm hearing rumors that Mr. Profidious has submitted his notice of departure. And Mr. Grime said his job was mission critical. - Really? - Yeah, his temper caused him to drop the ball. Listen, between you and I, off the record Right. I heard Mr. Perfidious killed 35 executives who were against the merger with Detex Skylab. Damn! Yeah, he was killin' the competition literally. Do you think he'll get away with it?

They never had old Strango's money. And then, when the show was over, and the children left, they would take me to the bedroom and pay me with pussy. Strango didn't want pussy. Strango wanted his moneys. moneys, moneys, moneys. So I killed them. 28 of 'em. Let's go everybody back. Strango, was on the run. If you can say that again dispatch.

My goddamn damn therapist, The rapist Called me up after the last show and the bitch was like, "Strango I caught your act, are you taking your meds?" I'm like, "Yeah" That bitch knew all the lines, so she doubled my dose, on my nose. She got me some mother fuckin' Divalproex and some Carbamazepine to combat my Prozac. So I just took some before the show. I'm kinda fucked up, but we gon' make it happen capt'n. As always I gotta get my drink a drink. To all the killers and the 100 dollars billers. Ah A hard proof.

Three priests, took a group of boys out for the evenin' fishin' they wait a while, then a boy gets up to get a soda, he trips on a lantern and the boat catches on fire. The first priest says, "We gotta save the boys." The second priest says, "fuck the boys." The third priest says, "Do you think we got time?" A boy goes to confession, he says, "What are you doing father?" The priest says, "It's called masturbation, and soon you will be doin' it." The boy says, "Why do you say that father?" The priest says, "'Cause my hand is gettin' tired." On a hot summer day, a famous celebrity tweeted, "It's a beautiful day, and I'm deciding which kid to have fun with today." The local priest replied, "I too am deciding which of your kids to have fun with today." fuck you princess! I know I'm fucked up. When I'm bored, I text a random number, "I hid the body, now what?" See what happens. Oh shit. A Wife asks her husband why he cheated on her. His reply was, "She was lying there naked on the table, what was I supposed to do?" The wife replies, "Perform the fuckin' autopsy!" Today was a terrible day, my ass got hit by a bus, and I lost my job as a bus driver. One day a father and his daughter was at a park. The daughter accidentally kills a butterfly, and her father says, "Just because you killed that butterfly, you won't get no butter for a week." They was there at the park next day, and the daughter kills a cockroach and father laughs and says, "Nice try." Say what you want about pedophiles, but at least they drive slow through schools zones. It was fulfilling being with my own kind and all. I tell a joke about my abusive dad, but I only remember the punchline. I hate my ex. I swear to God, that fuckin' bitch. I hate my ex. I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend's killer for the past two years, but no one would do it. Oh shit. Have you ever had that awkward moment when you gotta ask your Chinese neighbor have they seen your dog? A man walked into a library and asked for a book on committin' suicide.

That's when I realized his hands are on my shoulders. Oh shit. I need another, clean shot. That's the shit What's the difference between a black and a white fairytale.

Hitler walks into a bar, in hell. The bartender asks, "Why are you here?" Hitler calmly replies, "I killed 8 million Jews" "and three clowns." The bartender says, "Why three clowns?"

The doctor, not wanting to go against customs, he starts to kiss the donkey, he stands back of the donkey, he starts fucking the donkey. The Indian guy says, "Hey doc, are you done?"

I know the alcohol won't solve most of my problems, but it's worth a shot. I was readin' an article about fathers and sons drinking together, I remembered the time I took my daughter out for her first drink. Off we went to a local bar, two blocks away, Christmas Eve. I got her a Guinness. She didn't like it, so I drank it. I got her a Heineken. She didn't like that neither, so I drank it. I got her a Bud Light. She didn't like it, so I drank that. Then I figured maybe she liked whiskey, better than beer, maybe she like it. So we try some Jamesons. Nope. In desperation, I had to give her some Hennessy. Best liquor, the good good. She wouldn't even drink that neither, she wouldn't even smell it. What could I do? I drunk it. By the time I realized she just didn't like to drink, I was so shit faced I could hardly push her stroller back home. One Christmas morning, a boy wrote to Santa talkin' about, please send me a sister. Santa wrote back, "Okay, send me your mama." There's a plane going down over the desert, Christmas eve, but there are only three parachutes on board. There's four passengers, though, on board. The smartest man in the world, the best doctor in the world, an old priest and a young nerd. The doctor says, "People need me for my medical skills." He grabs the pair of first parachute pack and he jumps. The smartest in the world, he says "People need me for my intelligence." So he grabs a pack and he jumps. The old priest says, "You know what", "I've lived a long and happy life, you take the last 'chute" The nerd says, "Don't worry about it", "there's enough 'chutes for both of us. "The smartest man in the world took my backpack." Santa went to the doctors with a problem. Doc says, "What seems to be the problem?" Santa says, "I seem to have an apple pie stuck up my ass." The doctor says, " Well, you are in luck, because I've got just the cream for that." The nurse at the sperm bank asked him if he'd like a masturbate in the cup, he says, "Well, I'm pretty good" "but I don't think I'm ready to compete just yet." A man comes home from work, Christmas Eve. He sat down on his favorite chair, turn on the TV and he says to his wife, "Quick, bring me a beer" "before it starts." She looks at him a little puzzled, but she brought him a beer anyway, when he finished it, he said, "Quick, bring me another one, "It's about to start." This time she looked a little angry, she brought him a beer anyway. When it was gone he said, "Quick, another beer," "it's gonna start any second." She stops and says, "That's it, you bastard. "You walk in here, flop your fat ass down, you don't even say hello to me, "then you expect me to run around like a fuckin' slave? "You don't even realize that I cook and I clean and I wash and I iron all day in this mother fucker?" The husband says, "Oh shit, it's started." Hoes, hoes, hoes, where's my money. If you see me smiling, it's because I'm thinking about doin' somethin' naughty or evil. If you see me laughing, it's because I've already done it. Nigga. A mafia's son sits at his desk, writing a Christmas list to Jesus. He first writes, "Dear baby Jesus", "I've been a good boy the whole year, so I want to know.." He looks at it, he crumbles it up and he throws it away. He gets out a new piece of paper and he writes again, "Dear baby Jesus, "I have been a good boy for most of the year," "so I wanna know.." He again, crumbles it up and he throws it away. He then gets an idea. He goes into his mother's room, takes the statue of the Virgin Mary puts it in the closet and it locks the door. He takes another piece of paper and he writes, "Dear, baby Jesus, if you ever wanna see your mother again" Oh you like that? Three men die on Christmas Eve and go to heaven where they're met by St. Peters. In order to get in, he tells 'em, "You must each produce somethin'" "representative of the holidays." The first man digs in his pocket and he pulls out a match and he lights it. This represents the candle of hope. Impressed, Peter let's him in. The second man pulls out a tangle of keys and shakes 'em. "These are bells." He's allowed in too. So Peter says to the third man, "What do you have?" Third man proudly shows him a pair of red panties. "What do these got to do with Christmas?" Peter says. "They're Carol's." A pedophile Santa lures a group of Houston Girl Scouts with, "Hey girls, would you like some candy?" They all agree, then follow him to the North Pole. From there, he offers some more candy and they follow him to his house. Once again he offers 'em candy, and they follow him to the living room. As he leads them up the stairs, one of the girls looked at the other one, she says, "God, I hope we get laid before we get diabetes." Two older ladies were heard chattin' over lunch. One says to the other, "So, Harold brought me "a dozen long stem roses home last night. "You know what that means? "I'm gonna be spending all Christmas" "with my legs in the air" The other lady ponders this for a moment, and she finally says, "Why, don't you have a vase?" What did a pervert Santa say to his victim? "Go ahead, call the police, we'll see who comes first." On Christmas morning, a cop on horseback is sittin' at the traffic light. And next to him is a kid on his brand new bike. The cops says, the kid, "Nice bike you got there, did Santa bring that to you?" The kid say, "Yeah." The cop says, "Well, next year", "you tell Santa to put a tail light on that bike." The cop then gave a kid, $20 bicycle safety violation ticket And before the cop ride off, the boy says, "By the way, that's a nice horse you got," "did Santa bring that to you?" Humoring the kid, the cop says, "Yeah, he sure did." The kid says, "Well, next year, you tell Santa" "to put the dick underneath the horse, not on top." Here's a joke to tell your kids, 'cause I'm telling you all this dirty shit. Why do seagulls fly over the sea? Because if they flew over the Bay, they'd be bagels. A sweet and innocent young Italian girl gets married and the girl's mother lived downstairs. The girl had never made love to a man before and on their wedding night, when he takes off his shirt, she goes, running down the stairs, "Mama, mama, I can't believe it, he has hair all of his chest, what should I do?" The mother's makin' spaghetti sauce, she stirrin' the sauce thoughtfully and she says, "Hair in his chest, he's your husband," "it's your weddin' night, go upstairs." She goes up stairs, the man takes off his pants. This sends her running back downstairs to her mama. "Mama, mama, he has hair all over his legs," "what should I do?" The mother stirs the sauce thoughtfully and says, "Hair on his legs? He's your husband," "it's your weddin' night, go upstairs." The girl goes back upstairs, and the man takes off his shoes and socks. She looks down at him and sees that half of one of his feet is missin'. She goes crying back downstairs to her mama. "Mama, mama, he's got a foot and a half, what should I do?" The mother hands her daughter the spoon and says, "A foot and a half, here you stir the sauce," "I'll go upstairs." I'm Strango the Clown. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year's. Fuck all y'all. We outta here. Peace of pussy. Mic drop! Strango! Strango! Strango! Here's Strango! I'm bleeding I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding.

I'm gon' getcha - Leave me alone - I ain't got all day My momma makin' ribs and fish fries and bitch you knew that shit be fallin' off the bone Help! After my second performance that night I caught the coronavirus. An audience member coughed on me. I slit his fuckin' throat in the bathroom. He came from China. The virus was sweeping the nation. And for the first time in my life, I was scared. I asked myself, if Corona Virus isn't about beer, then why do I keep seeing cases of it? 2020 was a horrible year. The world is at a lock down. Look at what we've become. Did you hear the joke about the germ? Nevermind, I don't wanna spread it around. And then once again, Strango, found himself in love. Do you do stand up with this? Ta da. You wouldn't believe the shit I've done while havin' this nose on. This time, she hurt Strango in the worst way. I didn't wanna kill her, so instead, I wrote her a letter. Dear wife, I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you forever. I've been a good man to you for seven years, and I have nothing to show for it. These last two weeks, have been pure hell. Your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today, and that was the last straw. Last week you came home and didn't even notice I had a new hair cut. I cut my shit bald. I cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers. You at in two minutes and went straight to sleep after you watched all your soap operas. You don't even tell me you love me anymore. You don't want sex or anything that connects us as a husband and wife. Either you're cheatin' on me, or you don't love me anymore. Whatever the case is, I'm gone. Your ex-husband, Mr. Del Rio. Oh, P.S. don't try to find me. Your sister, Carla, and I are moving away to the Caribbeans, together. Have a great life. Broke evil ass bitch. Yeah with the bottom line as profit, that's what I'd talk. Yeah. No, I'm about to wrap up. No I got a couple photos I gotta file then that's about that No, I'm gonna pick up that Dom Perignon and.. Nope I got some Hennessy too. Yeah. No I'm gonna pick up the lobster and the shrimp. And yeah. No, you're not cookin'. You are not cookin' Carla. No, 'cause you fucking can't cook. Bitch I would rather chew on a condom. No. Yeah, I'm gonna pick that up. Got a letter? Got a letter from who? How the fuck? How did your sister know where we're at? Are you serious? Okay, where's the letter right now? In the library? Okay, did you read it? Okay. Yeah, yeah. I'll be home in a little bit. About eight. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Fuck, what did I do? This bitch can't cook. We've been together for a month and we ain't had sex yet. What the hell is going on? I know I made the wrong decision. I need to go home and deal with this shit. What's up Carlos. Yo, tell your man, Imma roll over there and smack the shit out his ass. The last batch at China white, that shit was booty. No, nigga that was garbage. Yeah, tell him to come correct man. Tell his grandma to come down on the prices. Yeah, I'm headin' home.

If only I had a babe You did good out here "The only thing we have to fear is, "fear itself". I need, I gotta get it right Gotta get it right. Or not. Letter. Letter. Bullshit. Some bullshit. Dear ex-husband. Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true, that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good man is a far cry from what you've been. I watched my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining and griping. Too bad that doesn't work. I did notice when you got a haircut last week. But the first thing that came to mind was you don't look like Michael Jordan. Since my mother raised me not to say anything, if you can't say something nice, I didn't comment. And when you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with my sister because I stopped eating pork seven years ago. About those new silk boxers, I turned away from you because the 49.99 price tag was still on them. And I prayed it was coincidence that my sister had just borrowed $50 from me that morning. After all of this, I still loved you and felt we could work it out. So when I hit them lotto for 10 million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home you were gone. Everything happens for a reason, I guess. I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you won't get a dime from me. So take care. Signed, your ex wife, Mrs. Del Rio. Rich as hell and free. P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this, but my sister Carla was born Carl. I hope that's not a problem. fuck! Okay. One bullet for that bitch. We might be pressed here 30 minutes, be seated, It's start raining in about 1 minute. Thank you. Wake up! What the fuck! Jesus Christ. What the hell time is it? It's eight o'clock in the morning.

She manipulated us, and I overheard a conversation when that bitch said, "If you ever have a child by that nigga," "I would disinherit you from my fortune." I Overheard that conversation. I was working as a intern, at a funeral home a couple of years back. And when I found out, when your mom died and they brought the body to me, Oh my God. This was like a gift from baby Jesus.
