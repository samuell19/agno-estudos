- Hey, look, here's a new guy. - I seen that. I ain't never seen him before. - You take his shoes, I'll take his money. - I'm on it, man. Whoa man. I thought you was already dead. - Get outta here! Go! - It's all good. It's all good. Get outta here. - Hey, hey mister. You okay? You don't look so good. I brought you some water. Here, I'll hold it. I'll hold it. You was thirsty. Where am I? - You're under the Second Street bridge. You don't remember how you got here? People like, dressed like you don't come and hang out down here. Here, let me help you. Girlfriend, get over here. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Come on we help you. You okay? You can walk by yourself? Hey cat, what's your name? - I don't know. Help me. Help me. Help me. - Get away from me you filthy beggar. Or I'll punch you in the face! Can you help me? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on here? Hey! - Oh my! - Seems to be the problem. This just tried to attack me. - No, no, no, no. I was asking you a question. - Hey, listen here, you need to keep your filthy hands to yourself. You hear me? - Yeah. I hear you. - Yeah, we have ordinances in this town against panhandling. - I don't even know what town I'm in. What town am I in? What town am I in? - You trying to be a funny guy? - I'm not trying to be funny. I just need to know where I'm at. - You know what? Welcome to the city of hard knocks. - Thank you, officer. - My pleasure ma'am. - Yeah dispatch. 1050. Send a wagon over to second and main over. Roger that. - Good morning. Or should I say good afternoon? - Where am I at? - Doesn't matter where you're at. - Who put me here? Who's in charge? - I am. I rule. As long as you're in here, I rule. - Back away man. Back away. - Hey man, no one tells me to back away, I rule this. - Guard! - You need to get back to Mexico. South to the border, this ain't East L.A. - Hey, you. - Guard! - You. Do you even know what you're doing in here and what you did to get in here? - Don't you ever put your hands on me. You know- - Go back where? Huh? Go back where? Huh? - I'm gonna get you. - Hey, man, what happened to you? - I had an altercation with some inmates. - I'm sorry what'd you say? - I got beat up. - You got beat up, huh? - Yeah. My jaw is killing me too. Think it might be broken. - Well, that's not good, because we're gonna be talking to the judge here in a minute and you're gonna have to speak up so she can hear you. - Who are you? - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't introduce myself. I'm your designated public defender. - Your name? - That's not important. You just need some kind of token representation because that's how this whole justice system works. - Yeah. I don't have one either. - You don't what? - A name. I don't have one either. - A name? Yeah, you do. It's right here. - John. John? - Yeah John. John Doe. - John Doe? - Well, that's obviously not your real name. They probably booked you under the name John Doe, because you were unresponsive. - Unresponsive? I was knocked out. - Right. So if I could just get your full name for the case file please. - What don't you understand? I got hit in the head. I don't know my name. I don't know nothing. I don't even know why I'm here. Why am I here? - Listen, I don't have time for games right now. - I'm not playing games here. I don't know. - That's not good, because the judge is gonna wanna know who you are. - Don't you think I wanna know who I am, huh? - You'd be surprised. Listen, we don't have that much time. We need to go over your charges. Okay? - Charges? What am I even being charged with? - What you did. Okay. Here are the charges from the arresting officer, aggressive panhandling and assault. - I didn't do that. - And you probably didn't but this officer tends to exaggerate a little bit when it comes to filing charges. - There you go. Right? That's good. I plead not guilty then. - Absolutely not. You plead guilty as charged. - What? - You heard me. You're going to plead guilty. I'm gonna tell the judge that this is your first offense and she's gonna let you walk outta here. - So a defendant has to prove that he's innocent? - You've been watching too much TV, Mr. Doe. - Hey, look, I may not remember my name, but I do know the judicial system. - Not in this jurisdiction you don't. You see, if you plead not guilty, the judge is then gonna have the arresting officer come in to testify. He's gonna be angry. He's gonna come up with all these new charges and she's gonna believe every word of it. - So I plead guilty? - You'll plead guilty and apologize. - I'll plead guilty. And I'll apologize. Still don't know your name. - It's almost time for her. - But what about the- - Please rise. The Honorable Judge Patterson is now presiding. - All right, let's move on to the next case. The City versus John Doe. John Doe? - Yes, your honor we're here. - Well, I can see that. What's with this John Doe nonsense? - Yes, your honor. The defendant here is suffering with some memory issues as a result of a head injury. - Is that right? - Yes, your honor. - I was directing the question to the defendant. - Yes, your honor. - I can't hear you speak up. - Yes, your honor. - Oh my God, man. What happened to your head? - I got beat up. - While in custody, I suppose? - Yeah in my cell. I got beat up. - And I suppose your head injury and memory loss are being blamed on the arresting officer? - No, no, no. I never said that. I never said- - If I may interject your honor, at no time did the defendant ever suggest to me that he was ever a victim of any kind of police brutality. - Fine. So then, the defendant would have no problem going on the record stating that he does not hold the city responsible for any injuries sustained while in custody? - Correct your honor. - I wanna hear it from him. - Your honor, I don't hold the city, the state responsible. - Speak up! - I do not hold the city or state responsible. - Including the arresting officer. - Including the arresting officer. - Fine. Now, these charges against you. Aggressive panhandling and assault. Can the defendant explain how he came to be arrested? - Guilty. I'm guilty. Guilty. - Did I ask you how you plead? - No. - Did I ask your defendant how he pleads counselor? - No, your honor. - No, I did not. I simply asked the defendant to explain to me how he came to be arrested. - I don't know. I don't remember. - Very well then. - I don't remember. I'm sorry. I don't remember. - You don't remember? But you're ready to plead guilty. - Yeah. - That doesn't make any sense to me. Does that make any sense to you counselor? - Well, the defendant has the utmost respect for the arresting officer and he is willing to accept the charges that were issued and witnessed by him. - Bull crap! You know, I now know what's going on with all these memory loss shenanigans. - Your honor? - Yes, the defendant was homeless and yes he was out panhandling when he saw a police officer and thought he'd get himself arrested. Oh and now he wants to become a ward of the state so he can get some free mental health care for this so-called amnesia. - No, no, no, no, no, no. I need help. But no, no. I'm not gonna be a ward of anybody. I don't wanna be a ward of anybody. I don't wanna be a ward of anybody. - Well, you'll get no help from me. I'm prepared to accept your plea and sentence you to the one night you've already spent in custody. - But your honor. - But nothing. You know, here's a thought, why don't you consider cleaning yourself up, finding a job and supporting yourself. Huh? That's a novel idea. What do you think? Next case. John Doe. - Who are you? Who are you! - Hey, you need to wash more than your face, you dirty bum! - Hey swampy, you hungry? Got some food left. Get outta here. Go dig it out the trash. You lazy bum. - Anything else? Anything else? - Help! Are you open? - Not for long, we close at five. - Look, I only need a couple minutes. - How can I help you? - I need some assistance. - How can I help you? With what? - With what? Isn't it obvious? - You'd be surprised how many people go to their local thrift store, they buy some rags, they dirty 'em up and they come in here to try to scam the government. - I'm not trying to scam you lady. I'm not trying to scam you. I'm not riffraff off the street okay. - You're gonna have to be more specific. - Specific? I'm homeless. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in I don't know how long. - I didn't hear anything at all about wanting to work, needing a job. - I'm not afraid to work lady. All right? I never said I wouldn't work. - All right, then the first thing I need is your name. - I don't know. Ida- - First name Ida spelled I D A? - We're both adults. I don't play games. I'm coming in here, being honest with you. Just need help. - You're wanting public assistance without giving me any kind of identification. - I have amnesia. I woke up under a bridge. I got robbed. I don't know who did this to me. I don't know my name. I don't know who I am. I don't know if I have a family out there. I don't know! I don't know. I just need help. Please will you help me? - You've been walking, wandering all over this town with a serious head injury. - Yes! Because nobody will help me. Everyone's being cold hearted like you. Everybody. Really? - Sir, it's five o'clock. Thank you for stopping by. I'm not gonna go. All right? How many time do I have to tell you, I need help? Huh? Huh? - Sir. - How many times? - All right sir. - What do you want me to do? Huh? What do you want me to do? Huh? Beg? Beg? Is that what you want? Is that what you want? Please help me. Please. - Sir. - I need somebody, who can help me. - All right. All right. Sir calm down. - Please. Just help. Please. Please. Please. - Sir, okay, okay, I get it. - Please. Please I need help. - I see that you really need help but what you need is not my help. You need medical assistance. Now, there's a hospital it has an emergency room, it's only five blocks away. I drive by on my way home. So if you're willing to ride along with me. - Really? - Yeah. Come on. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I understand. That's okay. I'll get it tomorrow. Don't worry about it. You need help. Sophia. We can see you now. - It's me. - I need to talk to you. - Just a second. I'll be right with you. - I told the nurse in charge about your situation. She said she'd have the doctor look at you just as soon as he can. I told her that you didn't know your name and that you don't have an ability to pay. So, she's opening up a case file under John Doe. - John Doe. Thank you. You're an angel. - Well, you're gonna have to be patient, you know, no pun intended. They're gonna work you in just as soon as the doctor can get you in. It might be awhile. Okay? - You're an angel. Good luck. - Thank you. - Okay. - Open your mouth. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Put your chin down to your chest. Okay. Oh yeah. Oh right there. Yeah. There's a pretty big lump right there. That looks pretty painful. - Mh-mm it hurts. - Okay. Okay. Bring your head back up. Okay. Any dizziness at all? Any blurred vision? - I got blurred vision but I don't know if I need glasses. I can't remember. - Okay. Any indigestion? You're sick to your stomach at all? - I don't know. I haven't eaten. - But you still have an appetite? - Oh yeah I'm hungry. - Okay. Okay. Mr. Doe, I think you've had a concussion. Okay. I'm going to order a CT scan for you, to see if you had any more damage to your skull or your brain. - So I'll be staying here at the hospital, right? - I don't know. I can't tell you that right now. It'll depend on what the CT scan shows. We'll be looking for bleeding in the brain. We'll be looking for increased intracranial pressure. - I thought anybody with a head injury stays here. - Not necessarily. Okay. Let's see what, we'll take it one step at a time. Let's see what the CT scan says. Okay? And then we'll take it from there. - So frustrating. I just wanna get my life back. I just wanna know who I am. I wanna go home. - Yeah. - Frustrating. - Yeah. Well let's get the CT scan one thing at a time. Okay. CT scan. We'll see what's going on there. And then- - Thank you. - I'll be out to the waiting room to see how you're doing. Okay. - This is so frustrating. So frustrating. - I'll see you in a little bit. - All right. - Please lie down Mr Doe. - Mr. Doe? You're awake? - Yeah. - Oh, good. Good, good. I'm glad you're getting some rest out here. - Yeah. - Okay. Well, I got the results of the CT scan. You do have a little bit of a skull fracture. Okay? That should heal up on its own. And happily there was no damage to your brain. Okay? And the scratches and the cuts on your head, I really don't think they require sutures. - Okay. So my memory? When is that coming back? - Okay. Well the amnesia. I'm not a brain surgeon or a psychiatrist. What I think you've got is post-traumatic amnesia. Okay. Now, post-traumatic amnesia, your memory'll probably come back in a couple of weeks. But total memory, it may take a couple of months. - Two months? - Possibly. - Two months? - Possibly. Possibly. Now, I've got some ibuprofen here for you, for your headaches and your pain you're having there. Plus I think we should get a hold of social services to get you into a homeless shelter. You'll heal up a lot faster if you're out of the elements. - Yeah. - Yeah. Now I do have some good news. - Yeah? - Your jaw looks fine. - Yeah. Thank you. - Best wishes to you, sir. - Thank you. - Dude, you're like a zombie. Man you need this. - Why don't you just light that thing already? You're driving me nuts. I get it. Hey! The lid's open. - What are you doing in our dumpster? - Look, I'm just hungry. I'm just hungry. Okay. - You don't know who's dumpster this is? - This is ours. - Ours. You don't belong here. - Mister, don't you know? - Everybody around here knows that. I'm just hungry. - Uh-uh, you listen to me, you get out of my dumpster. - Look look, there's plenty for us to share. - No. - That's our pizza man. - I'll bring it up. I'll bring up. - No that's ours. - We don't share. It's our dumpster. - You're gonna have to do something. Shut it. - Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. What are you doing? We'll teach him a lesson a lesson yeah. What are you doing? Hey! Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. - Hold on. Somebody put a pallet in front of the dumpster. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. - I see the problem, somebody jammed the rod in the lid. What the heck? What are you doing in there? Get outta there. - Somebody locked me in. - Well get outta there. - Oh, I can't get up. My leg. - I said get out of the dumpster now. - Aah, my leg. My leg. - Now get. I've got some Ibuprofen here for you. Somebody help! Tired of nobody caring! Nobody cares. I don't even care who I am anymore. You win! I'm done, you win. Who are you? Huh? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you boy? Huh? What do you want? Huh? What do you want? What? I'm leaving! I'm going. That's what you wanted. I know it's your bridge. I'll throw myself off over here. Okay? What? That way? Oh you want me to go with you? That's what you want? I'm listening to a dog. I'm talking to a dog now. I've lost it. It says no pets. I didn't make these rules. I didn't. Looks like you're gonna have to stay outside. You sit and stay, okay? Deal? Yeah? I'll be right back, okay? Hello? - Sir. You look injured. Come on in. Have a seat. - Thank you. Thank you, Father. - So what brings you here today? - Would you believe, a dog? Excuse me. - Yeah. A dog brought me here. I was at my lowest point. I was ready to give up. I was ready to end it all. And a dog, brought me off those rails. A dog led me here. - So you're saying a dog saved your life? - Yeah. It's not much of a life though. It's a life I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemy. - Well, that's nonsense. God didn't put you into this life for you just to end it on your own. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - If I was so important to God, explain this. Why would a God, let me get injured in this way? Why would a God have me walking the streets, not knowing my own name? Not knowing if I have a family, if I have kids. Why would a God have me living under a bridge? Why would God let people be so mean to me, that they won't even help me when I ask a question, huh? Explain that Pastor. - Well, I know this is not the time that you want me to say that God works in mysterious ways, but He does. - Mysterious ways? - Yes. - You got that right Father. Mysterious ways. - Well, are you hungry? - Yeah. - Mmh? - I'm really hungry. - Well you sit right there, 'cause I'm going to get you some food and I'm also gonna take you down to the clothes donation room. And we're gon' get you something nice to wear. Here you are. I hope this is to your liking. - Thank you. - Here's your spoon and a napkin. - Thank you. Thank you. - Well, you eat up. - All right. And I'll be back. Hey, I got you something. I brought you something. I told you, I wouldn't forget you. That good? You eat that, okay? I got to go talk to this preacher man, all right? When I get back, I'll play with you some more okay? Father. - Oh, you've returned. Well, I thought we'd lost you for good. - No, I'm back. I told you I'd come back and finish our conversation. So, I'm here. - This is a time when I usually ask, people what their name is, but I know you can't tell me that. - Nah, I went to the doctors recently. They said it could be possibly weeks, or months before I get my memory back. Months. - All right, so presently you have no recollection of who you were prior to your injuries? - That's what makes me upset. That's what makes me question my faith. - Have you been born again? Have you been saved? - Like, Jesus Bible thumping saved? Is that what you're talking about? - No, just born again. Accepted Christ. - Nah. - But this is different. If you was born again, Jesus has entered your heart and soul and he still should be there. - I know what you want me to say. I know what you're leaning towards. You want me to validate your faith, right? - I remember the day Christ entered my life. But even if I didn't, I would think I was still know that he was there, guiding everything I do and say. - I'd like to think I was saved. I don't know. - Well do you pray? - Haven't prayed, since this happened. Maybe I prayed before this all happened. Maybe. I like to think I did. I think maybe in my heart I did. - Even with your recent loss of memory, I would have thought you would have at least tried prayer. Especially if you had previously been introduced to Christ. - Previously introduced to Christ. Look at me. Look at me, Father. Do I look like a Christian to you? Look at me. Take a good hard look. I am the image of someone who doesn't follow God. Look at this. I woke up and look what's on my hands. Look, what's on my face. These are gang tattoos on my face. Is this a man who follows God? Is this a man who sits in here and prays? - Well, looks can be deceiving. You know, you seem like a real kind and gentle man. A head injury doesn't bring about sudden empathy. - A thoughtful, gentleman. Hmm. Yeah, sure. Thoughtful, gentleman. Yeah. I wish no ill will towards anybody. And I have no malice in my heart. I even feel sorry for those that do. - As Christ was dying on the cross, he forgave them that tormented him. You have the same attribute that Christ has, in you. - So what you're saying, is that if you don't accept Christ in your heart you can't be a good person, a kind person, a giving person? Is that what you're telling me? - No, I'm not saying that. There is plenty of agnostics people that are kind and good and loving. But your, your personality seems more resident with Christian faith. - I'd like think I was saved. I'd like to think I'm that person that you think I am. Well, let's pray. Dear God, help this gentle and kind man, realize who he is in Christ. And bring his fond memories back of the life he lived before. And help him remember those glorious times. In Christ Jesus name, I pray. Amen. - I really have nowhere to stay. - Well, I assume you would like a bed for the night. In the morning, I'd hope you would join us in a chapel, for a sermon. - All right. I'll be there. I'll be there. I don't know if I prayed to you in the past. I hope I did. I see a bad man in the mirror, and I hope that's not me. I hope I haven't hurt others. I need to know who I am. I need to know what I've done. Why, I deserve this? - I'm sorry, we don't have any hymnals or musical accompaniment. But if you know the words to this hymn. I'd like you to sing along. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost, but now I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind, but now I see ♪ ♪ 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear ♪ ♪ And grace my fears relieved ♪ ♪ How precious did that grace appear ♪ ♪ The hour I first believed ♪ - One of the miracles that God gives us every day, is a birth of a child. Whether it be the birth of a son, or a daughter, or a grandchild, or our own birth, of course no one asked us if we wanted to be born or to whom we wanted born. From the moment we left the womb, we were suddenly thrust into an environment where we needed to learn to survive. We may have been born into a poor family or an abusive family, and wonder why did God place us there? Instead of a grand mansion, with nannies who would feed us the best baby food from silver spoons and fine China. But the greatest of God's miracles, is not our physical birth but our spiritual birth. Yes, I say the spiritual birth of a lost sinner into a spiritual life is the most miraculous gift that God can give to mankind. So why is spiritual birth more miraculous than physical birth? Huh? Because when we are born again, God allows us to escape the pains of death in this life and grants us eternal life in heaven. You know, when I was in seminary, Father Daniels asked us to describe the feeling of being born again. As students, well we knew we were born again and had Christ in our hearts. But man, we had great difficulty putting that into words. You know, I still have my notes from that day. I still have them right here. And this is how father Daniels explained the spiritual state of being born again. "To be born again doesn't mean that a good person just becomes more of a good person. Or the immoral person just becomes more of a moral person. Or that a church member becomes an even better church member. To be born again means, that a spiritually bankrupt person, gains all the promises and blessings that God promises to those who are his. It means that a totally depraved wicked person is completely cleansed of all his or her sins. It means that a person who has absolutely nothing to give to God, can receive the greatest gift that they possibly can receive. And that is eternal life. It means that someone who's completely and totally rotten to the core, can become a child of God. Who is that spiritually bankrupt person, that is rotten to the core, that has nothing to offer God? That person is you. And that person is me. Now I would like to read from the book of John 3:1-8. Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus. Who's a member of the Jewish ruling counsel. He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, I know you're a teacher, a man from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing, if God were not with him". Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again." "How can someone be born again when they're old?" Nicodemus, says. "Surely they can not enter a second time, in their mother's womb to be born". Jesus answered, "Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God, unless they are born of water and the spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised by my saying, you must be born again. The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it's going. So it is with everyone born of the spirit." Tell me brothers, is there anyone here, who wants to hear the sanctifying sound of God's breath blowing through their soul? - Here boy! Here boy! Here boy! Here boy! Here boy! Here boy. There you are. There you are. There you are. Don't you leave me. Don't you leave me, okay? We're partners, okay? Okay? Don't leave me again. I don't know how to do this. I don't know if I am doing this right. A dog brought me here. Dog brought me off the ledge. Dog saved my life. I don't understand a God, a God who would do this to me. A God who would leave me severely beaten that I don't even know who I am. Why are you doing this to me? What did I do? Do you hate me that much? Why do you hate me? Pastor asked me, if I've invited you into my heart? If I've been born again? I don't even know. I can't answer him. He says I should know even if I don't have a memory. I wish I could but I can't lie, to validate his faith. I don't even know if I've done this before. I'm here now. I'm here now. Make yourself known. Tell me you're there besides me, guiding me, walking next to me. It's hard and I don't wanna be alone. I don't wanna be alone. hard it is. I don't wanna be alone. Tell me you love me. Woo! Man. - Nice dog. All right man, where are you from man? - Here, there, everywhere. You know what I mean? Just tryna stay warm, bro. Find some food. - I hear you, man. - Yeah. - What'd you do, man? - Man, I'm a groundskeeper man. I'm picking up trash and dog poop all day. In this huge big old park. Yeah. - How is it, man? Is it as awesome as I think it is? - I don't know, man. I mean, it's no fresh air really because you got a smelly bag of garbage you're carrying around all day, and putting strain on your arms and back. - I would die. - Plus, the manager, pays me 30 bucks a day. - Cash? - Yeah, but it's under the table? She thinks that she's helping out the underprivileged. People like me, who is doing her job, while she kicks back in her air conditioned office. - Let me tell you something, brother. Look at the beauty out here. I don't care it's raining, bro. This is God's creation, man. I would die. I would die to have a job like yours. - Yeah. - What you doing? Thinking of quitting? - Actually I have been. - What? - If you're interested, I'll hand my job over to you right now. I'll give you this rod and this bag. And I'll take you right over to the supervisor's office. So you could check in with her. - You not jabbing me right? - It's right over there. Nah, nah, man, nah. It's right over there by the public restrooms. - You're not jabbing? - No. - Really? Dude, how about that vest? You gave me that vest man, that's a deal maker. - The deal is made. - Oh man. Dude. You're kidding me. - I'm not kidding man. - Oh man. How do I look? How do I look? - You look like a groundskeeper. Man, I have found own replacement and I didn't even leave the supervisor high and dry. - Kelly did you received that message in regards to the event that's coming up next week? We have to be out by 3:30. - Yeah. Yeah, I got it. - Excuse me. Don't tell me, another one quit again? - Yes ma'am, but if you give me a shot, these grounds out here will be immaculate. There'll be no trash out there and I promise you you're gon' be happy you hired me. - Are you down on your luck fella? - Truthfully, I am. Woke up under a bridge, head injury, can't remember nothing. - No family or friends to help out? - I don't know if I have kids. Family, nothing. - Well, you know what? I'm gonna help you out. At least as far as a job goes. - Really? Ma'am, I noticed you have a garage out back there. You think me and my dog could possibly sleep there? Wait a minute though, just until I regain my memory and get on my feet. I promise you. - You know what? I suppose so. As long as you take care of everything, you don't take anything. Keep the place neat. Don't make a mess. - No, I promise. I promise you. We're gonna keep that place clean. You're not gonna be disappointed. - Now lemme ask you, did my ex employee, did he explain what the job entails? - Yes, ma'am. He said cleaning up stuff, cleaning up poop. Just making sure the place is really spick and span. - Also disposing of the trash in the dumpsters behind the restrooms. - Wait, you said dumpster. Yes. - Does that dumpster have a lock on it? - Yes, why? - Has anyone ever fallen in and gotten stuck? - Not that I have heard of. - You sure? Yes, nothing, no one- - All right no.

That was much appreciated. - Oh man, was that you buddy? I'm so sorry. Me and my girl here, we're just, we were just having a bad day and I didn't mean to take it out on you. - Don't explain. Hey, I forgive you. God bless you. - You too buddy. Don't act so high and mighty to me. You were laughing too when I threw that food in the trash. - Well, yeah, I laughed, but when I turned around and saw that man in the garbage, I felt really bad. I even asked God if He would forgive us for how we treated him. I don't know, I just, I really hoped that meeting him today meant that he forgives us, and God forgives us too. - Honey I do think you may be right. - Hey, isn't that the guy we pushed in the creek before? - What do you say we help them get a big gulp from that creek? - That'd be funny as all out. - Let's go. See anything? No. Grab the chainsaw. - Okay, let's get outta here. - Let's go. Hey, what are you guys doing? - Dang it. Get out of our way. Or I swear I'll cut you in half. What? What? - What happened? Why'd you stop? - I don't know, maybe it ran out of gas. - Or maybe my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ protected me. - What? - Put it back. - No, no. - Put it back! - Just do it brother put the saw back. - All right. I'll put it back. - When I got this job, I was made responsible for every single tool in this place. And if one goes missing, I lose my job. So, these tools are more important than your life? - Listen, Mr., we learnt our lesson, just let us leave, please. - A rusty chainsaw, that was worth taking another man's life? You wanna go to jail for the rest of your life? I don't. - Is that what you want? No sir. - Huh? Is it worth it? How much did you think you were gonna get from that chainsaw? - Maybe 20 bucks. - 20 bucks huh? - Maybe. - Look, 20 bucks. You gave us $20. - I just tried to kill you. - Yeah, but I'll stop you from living this kinda life. - We could sure use the money sir. - We have a sister at home we gotta feed. - Yeah. How old are you guys? - 16. - Yeah? You guys can get a job, right? Should be working for money. Not doing this. You wanna be away from your mom and sister? Is that it? - No, sir. - Come down the mission tomorrow, I know the pastor there. He'll help you guys get jobs. Earn money the right way. Yeah? - I can do that. - Thank you, sir. I can't repay you. - That's all right. Go. Heavenly Father, guide these boys in the way they're supposed to go and protect them, Lord Jesus. Amen. Boy. Really? Hide in there. Father. - Hey. - How are you doing? - Oh good son, where are you been staying my son? - You know what, I actually got a job. Can you believe that? - Oh wow. - Working down at the city park as a maintenance worker. - Oh wow. - Yeah, supervisor, she's letting me stay in the adjacent garage. Things are looking up. If I can get this memory right, think I'll be good. - Well, you know, you're always welcome here. You do know that? - Yeah, I know that. And I appreciate that, but I ain't gonna take a cot, from someone out there that needs it more than me. - Well, I do appreciate you stopping in now and again. - Yeah. I gotta tell you something though, I invited a couple of teens up to no good down at the park, but invited them down, maybe we can help them find a job. What do you say? - Sure, sure. Be glad to. - Thank you. Thank you. I can always depend on you. Thank you. - Appreciate that. - Speaking of the devil, or should I say, ex devils, right boys? - Well, gentlemen, take a seat. - These are the young men I was telling you about. - Oh, okay. - I hope we ain't delaying your servicing. - No the service can wait, the Lord has more pressing work for me to do now. - Mom was, she was really grateful for the money you gave us last night. We really appreciate that. - I'm glad I could help. - You boys in school? - Not right now because of summer break. But this fall I'll be a sophomore and my brother here, will be a junior. - Hmm. Well that's great. So as far as working hours, you're pretty flexible until school starts back up? - I don't think that'll matter much. - Why do you say that? - Because we don't think people would want people like us working for them. - Nobody wants us. Not even our father wants anything to do with us. - Listen, you can't concern yourself with what others think. - Before he left us, our dad said it was all worthless and didn't wanna see us no more. - Look, look, you don't say that about yourself, all right. Look at me. I'm all covered in tattoos. You don't think I get judged? You don't think people out there judge me. I have to prove. I've been trying to prove the last couple of days that I ain't that person that they see. - You both are good in the eyes of the Lord. - Oh, I don't know why anyone would wanna hire a couple of dummies like us. - Don't say, do you think your brother's dumb? Look at him. Is he dumb? - No. Is he dumb? - Of course not. - Then? - Yeah, but other people don't see it that way. Even the teachers in school say that they're just pushing us along from grade to grade. Just to get rid of us. - Don't worry about what others think. What you guys need to concern yourself with is proving 'em wrong, right? Prove 'em wrong. Your mother, she needs you, right? I think she needs you more than what you guys think. Right? - That's why we decided to come here if you helped us out. - Exactly. I'm happy you did, man. - I'm so sorry for trying to hurt you last night. I'm so sorry. I wish I was dead. - Hey nah, nah, nah you don't say that. Yeah, don't say that. - Look at me. I forgive you. All right? Worry about being an example to him. Can we be excused for a moment? - Yeah, sure. Go ahead and have a seat in the chapel. Okay, don't go anywhere right? We'll be right up. - You know, I don't know what happened last night and I don't know if I wanna know. - Nah, you don't. But God, he works in mysterious ways. - You right about that. He sure does. Well, good morning, everyone. I'm really glad to see everybody here. Do you wanna hear about Jesus today? Even though he had done many good deeds and how many people, Jesus wasn't originally regarded as the son of God. His fellow Jews ignored his righteous acts and tried to use his words against him. While attending the celebration inside the temple, other Jews demanded that he declare himself the son of God. Jesus answered, "The works that I do, bear witness about me. But you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me. I give them eternal life and they will never perish. And no one will snatch them from my hand. My father gave me the sheep and no one is greater than Him. He and I are one." When Jesus left the temple, his detractors followed him outside. They had taken issue with Jesus' comment that he and the father are one. They began to collect rocks with the intention to stone Jesus to death. Jesus faced the angry mob, and said, "I have done many good works, for which do you stone me?" The men answered, "It's not for your good works, it's because you called yourself God." Jesus replied, "Are you saying that I'm blaspheming because I said I was the son of God? The father is in me and I am in the Father." The angry men realized no one wanted to cast the first stone. So they dropped their rocks and left Jesus alone. That story is from John 10. Jesus had more to say in this chapter, which I would like to read for you now. "Truly, truly I say unto you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but comes in another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him, the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls them by name, and he leads them out." Jesus said, "I am the door for the sheep. If anybody enters by me, he will be saved, and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and to kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd and the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my father." Amen. - Aye, you dropped something. - I know you. Hey? Yeah. You took my whole life from me. - How do you know me? You don't know me. - You took my whole life. - What are you talking about, man? - You robbed me. You hit me in the head. Hey, what do you want? - Come on guys, let's go. Where's my ID? - We just took the cash. - And what street? What street this happen on? - Fifth street, yeah, yeah, by the market. - My car? What kinda car was I driving? - It was a red "Kia," I think. Think! - It was dark, it was really dark, I think. It was a red "Kia" man. Get outta here. Go! Go! Here's your purse ma'am. - Thank you kind sir. Wish there were more nice men like you out there. Can I ever repay you? Do you need some cash? - You know when I really need your help? Was the bus stop. - The bus stop? He grabbed ahold of my arm officer, and he wouldn't let me go. - Excuse me ma'am. There was a car that was broken down on your parking lot. Probably got towed. Do you happen to know where that tow truck took it? - Can you tell me why you abandoned it? - I didn't abandon my car, ma'am, I wouldn't do that. I was changing out the tire and a group of thugs attacked me, hit me with a tire iron. I barely even remember my own name. - Guess that explains all the blood. - Yes ma'am. Obviously though, thank God I was able to walk away from that. But like I said, I don't remember nothing. I need to find my car. Maybe it has a clue to where I live. Who I am. - I want you to know, that I did wait a while to call the towing company. I was waiting for the owner to return. - And I appreciate that. I do appreciate that. - And you were in a no parking zone. - I did not know that, and I'm not questioning why you called the tow truck company ma'am. - Then why are you here? I doubt it's for the fresh produce. - No, ma'am like I said, I just need to find my car, I need to find those clues, so I can find out who I am. Tow truck? - Towing company. "Monroe Towing." - "Monroe Towing". Oh thank you. Thank you. "Monroe Towing." Do you know where "Monroe Towing," is? - A couple of blocks up fifth, turn left on Monroe Avenue. - Fifth Avenue, Monroe Avenue. - It's called "Monroe Towing," it's located on Monroe Avenue. - Obviously right. I thank you, and I know this is gonna sound stupid. You might even get mad at me, but do you happen to know the make model and color of my car? - You don't know the make and model of your own car? - Like I said I got hit in the head. I don't even know my own name. - Didn't think it was that bad. - Yeah it was pretty bad. - It was a red "Kia". - Red "Kia." I own a red "Kia"? - I'm not judging. - Thank you for your help. - Why don't you take some apples for your trip? - Can I get one for my dog? - Of course. You're welcome. - God bless you, okay.
