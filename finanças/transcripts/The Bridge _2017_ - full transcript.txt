[panicked shouting] [shouting continues] [in foreign language] Ayoni. Come on. Leave me alone. -You must go now! -To where? Please go. My father shouldn't meet you here. Please leave now. Ayoni, come on. Get out of here! [man] Ayoni! [shouting continues] -[in English] Jire, that reminds me. -Yeah? There's a traditional ceremony happening in Sapati tomorrow. Okay. His Highness insists I have to be there. So, you're coming to back me up. -[chuckles] -Okay. [people cheering] [drums beating] [man singing in foreign language] [drums beating] [people chanting] [upbeat music playing] [in foreign language] Greetings, my people. Welcome. You are great folks. Your Majesty. May your reign last long. -I greet all the chiefs here present. -[people exclaim] I greet every villager too. [exclaiming] It is a great privilege to be alive and well today. [exclaiming] We are grateful our sacrifice has been accepted. It is time to celebrate. Congratulations. [cheering] [drums beating, people chanting] [cheering] I do hope you are enjoying the meal. Absolutely, Ma. Congratulations, Your Highness. Thank you. And thanks for your hospitality. Thank you very much. [chuckles] You're always welcome. Obadare mentioned that you're an engineer at the Aviation Institute. Yes, Ma, and I also fly aircraft. -Oh, really? -Yes, Ma. That's good. [chuckles] Keep it up. -Thank you, Ma. -Uh, Brother Dare-- So what's your next plan now that you are wrapping up your studies? Of course you know I have been flying privately. So, since I'm rounding out my commercial course, I'd like to test the waters. Mm. But we agreed that you're not going to fly commercially. Yes, Your Highness. But I still have to rack up a good number of flight hours. It'll only take a few years... for that to happen. I see. Jire, please don't mind them. [chuckles] Your Highness is fighting with the fact that... this boy wants to fly all over the world. -Ah! -[chuckles] And while he's flying all around the world, how will he have time for his royal duties? [sighs] Please excuse me. I need to make an urgent call. -[hums note] -[all humming note, laughing] Wonderful. -The music is fantastic. -[man whoops] You are all great folks. What? It's a great day to celebrate. [all laughing] My beloved friends, cherished associates... well-wishers, ladies and gentlemen... I stand before you here today a very happy man. Happy because God is good. I am grateful to God... for his love for me and my family. Me, an unlovable man. [chuckles] I am grateful that life has been good to us-- to me especially, an undeserved man. So good to have given us this beautiful gift of a daughter. [exclaims, chuckles] This angel... My only precious jewel... [people laughing, exclaiming] My only precious jewel. When she smiles, I remember the smile of her mother which captivated me. [men, African language] She looks like her mother. -And behaves like her mother. -[laughing] [buzzing] [line ringing] [out-of-service tone rings] -[man clears throat] -[woman speaks African language] -This, your son... -Mm-hmm. What is wrong with him? Look, he's still acting like a child. I thought that when he returned, he would be more matured, more responsible. [mutters] At least he would have learned that he's not only the crown prince but the future king of this land. But... [chuckles] [indistinct] ...he still wants to be king. God forbid. Your Highness, this is his destiny. No one will take this position from him. Nobody can change that. You know Obadare is a little playful. Let me tell you the truth. He took after you. -Me? -Yes! [exclaims] You think I have forgotten what you were like before we got married? Yes! You used to play around and chase girls. -[laughs] -I know what time it took you to become this wise and noble king that you are today. A child will only take after his father. -He took after you! -Me? But I assure you he will not disappoint you. Well, okay, if you say so. -Um, Jire? -Your Highness? I can see that you're much older and mature. I need you to help guide him. Let him know that no matter where he goes, he must come back home. Look! This is his place. Let him realize he's my heir. I want him to live with that consciousness. Keep telling him to live now as the king that he is potentially. So be it. I have heard you, Your Highness. Thank you. Talk to him when I'll be out of the place. I will, Ma. Your Highness! You know, some years back, when it became clear to us that we were going to have an only child... I felt disheartened. I felt cheated by nature. I said to myself, "A girl? Just a girl?" But my late elder brother, God rest his soul... [all] Amen! He said, "It is not the sex of the child that matters, whether it is a boy or a girl, what matters is the upbringing you give the child. If you want a son, then raise a son." Exactly! So I decided to raise a son. And today, the little girl that was running around naked yesterday... [all laughing] ...has become a full-blown woman. She has become a medical doctor. -First amongst equals. -God's instrument of healing! The best amongst her peers. A woman of substance, beauty and character. God's instrument of healing... Doctor... Stella Ihoma Maxwell. [people whoop, cheer] A daughter who's more than ten sons put together. [whooping] Please put your hands together for her. [cheering] -Great Igbo people! -Hey! -Great people! -Hey! -Great people! -[cheering] Let us eat and drink. [all chuckling] Let us celebrate. [upbeat music plays] She was supposed to call me as soon as she got home. [chuckles] She was probably tied up-- you know, back home with her parents. Must be easy. [phone vibrates, ring tone plays] Aha. Hey, babe. How are you doing? I've been trying to call you all day. Wasn't sure what happened. I know, I know. I'm so sorry. No, I won't change my mind at all. Actually, I can say... it's what it is. Yeah, I just need to clear up a few things with my father. All right, then. Yes, of course. All right, then. Okay, then. I love you. Yep, me too. Bye. Do people still actually say, "Me too"? And what is that supposed to mean? I mean, everybody knows it is a condensed script for "I love you too." -So what is the point? -Who says I was saying anything? Oh, sorry, my mistake then. I hope I have not offended you. I seem to be quite good at that, regretfully. No, no, no, no. Oh, Augustine, you're not annoying me at all. I'm sorry for being so, um... I don't know. I guess I'm just a little tired. Oh, yes, I see. Being a celebrity can be quite exhausting. [chuckles] Oh, Augustine, that is so very funny. [chuckles] I didn't mean to, but... I am glad I could get some laugh out of you. So I overheard you saying you would be going back to Ilorin in a few days. And I was thinking maybe you and I could do some catching up before you go off. Oh. I'm sorry. I guess tomorrow will be quite busy for me. Oh. Oh, it's okay. It is okay. I can give you a call if you don't mind. Sure. That's fine. Thank you. My beautiful damsel. I will give you a call. -[man] Good morning, guys. -[all] Good morning, sir. As you all can see, it's a perfect, beautiful morning to fly. We've got a lot of hours to do our flight today. We were briefed on our weather reports, and we all have checked our weathers. It's cavalcade this morning. Drum-Kilo, Sara-Delta, and Romeo-Charlie are all serviceable. Always remember-- safety at all times. Safety first. Landing is compulsory, takeoff is optional. -Any questions for me? -No, sir. All right, then. Let's go have some fun. All right. Let's do this. Now... By the way, what are you doing tonight? Eh, I'm less busy. Look, I'm gonna tell you something. Maybe after this flight, in the night, we can go for a drink or something. Definitely. Good idea. But you know I have to pick up my girl. [beeps] [man speaking over radio] Dare, I have always wanted to ask... What do you want with this girl? What do you mean? What's your intention with her? I want to marry her, of course. -Ah. You want to marry her. -Yes. Do you have an idea how your parent will feel about it? And do you think her parent in the east will support this? [chuckles] Look, you just leave all of that to me. I won't be the first Yoruba man to marry an Ibo lady. But... See this girl? She's my engine. I can't fly without her. Hi, guys. I'm so sorry I'm late. Hey, baby. How are you? -Hi, Jire. -Hey. -How are you doing? -Good. -Shall we? -Let's go. You look amazing, as usual. [dance music playing] Babe. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Stella, you know I love you, right? I know, I know, I know. And I love you too. I'm just making sure. No matter what happens, right? Seriously. Okay, okay. [no audible dialogue] Oh, my God, that was so much fun. [laughing] Yes. Yes. [sighs] Sit up for a minute. We've been doing this for so long. Yeah. Don't you think it's the right time to do the right thing? Marry me, Stella. So... you came all this way to tell us this? A boy we don't know... from a family we don't know... asks for your hand in marriage, and you give him your consent. Please understand. I don't mean to disrespect tradition. I don't want to disregard my royal responsibilities. But I love this girl. She's everything I've ever wanted in a woman. Everything. A Yoruba? From Yoruba tribe. One who eats palm oil soup. Leave us. Now, Stella... Yes, Dad? My sweet mother. From the day you were born... through your growing years... through your schooling years... through your years as the daughter of this family... you've never once disappointed me, never. Why are you silent? Please answer. Mother... -Your Highness... -What else do I say? What else do you want me to say? You've just said it. But this, your decision... It means nothing but the disregard of our culture! I know this is not the way to do it-- And you will not do it that way! What kind of child are you? Who do you think you are? Huh? Do you want a stranger to be your queen? A girl we have not checked. A girl we know nothing about her parents. In fact, sometimes I... I worried about you, wondering how a child could be such an epitome of perfection. You never once made me angry. And you know it's not difficult to make me angry. Now, this matter of... your telling us that... you want to marry some... some punk from the southwest-- I will consider it... as a first error, your first error in this whole wide world. After all, you're just a child. Yes, you may be smarter and more gifted than your peers... but you're yet to know and understand the world for what it is. Oh, Father... Don't interrupt me. And you sit down there to tell me that you love her and you've asked her to marry you. Didn't you learn anything from me? Huh? Then you go and bring somebody, some nonentity from somewhere and declare-- -Father! -Sit down! Sit down there! I haven't finished! Sit down! So I will forgive you this error just this once. You will never see that boy again. You will never again mention his name. And you will never bring up the matter of marrying anyone else except someone from our tribe, from our culture, and from our tradition. Is that clear? Yes, Father. Now, go and apologize to your mother for causing her this anxiety. Now... I want you to go and cancel that proposal. And don't let me hear anything about that again in this palace, right? I hope you understand my words. Maybe you don't know it. I doubt that you've checked that the person you want to marry is not up to you in anything. -And in case you want to find out-- -Please listen, Father. Just listen. Since I was born... whatever you ask of me, I do. And I have tried so well not to disobey you. But on this matter, I will marry who I want. -I will marry Stella. -What? Uh, Son, look here. No, Mother, you look here. I didn't ask to be a prince. There are very few things I want in life, and one of them is to be with someone I love. So if you love me, and you don't want me to disappear from your lives altogether... What? ...you will agree to my choice for marriage. -Obadare, come here! -Dare, come here! He's really leaving. -Olori-- -Your Highness-- I told you this wouldn't work. My father has never been angry with me before. Never. Baby... Stella. Come here. Sit. Stella, we can't let them do this to us. We have to fight for this love. After all this time, after everything we've been through together. All the good times, the bad times. It's just too much. Do you remember when I first met you? When they brought me into the hospital with the head injury. I was shaking when I saw you. I couldn't concentrate. Do you know what that means? As soon as we met, you started taking my pain away. The very first day. We've been through too much together for them to stop us. I hate to see you in pain. Just like that day when you hurt yourself outside the house. Had to carry you up and bring you in. I didn't even know what to do. I just knew I had to do something. I did whatever I could. You've always been there for me. You always take care of me. All the times I've been ill. Remember that last one, when I had it really, really bad? Remember the mess I made? [retches] And you healed me. You took care of me. I can't do without you. [sighs] And then you remember the day I was ironing, when I was ironing my silk shirt that I love so much? I decided from that moment you were going to do all my ironing for me. And you burned my shirt for me. [chuckles] Oh! Oh, my shirt! After all that... we are not going to let them do this to us, Stella. We have to stay together forever. You know we are meant to be together. Don't you know? Look at me. Tell me. We are destined to be together. I love you so much. Please... Stella, please marry me. Yes. Yes? [chuckles] I love you so much. [camera clicking, whirring] [no audible dialogue] [Dominic] Mm-hmm. Yes? Are you sure about this? Okay. Thank you. No, no, no. No need for that. I'll sort it out. What is the matter? Dominic, what is it? [sighs] Your daughter. She got herself married. My God. Someone saw her picture at the federal registry in Ilorin. She got married to that bastard she had told us about. I didn't see this coming. [dishes, cutlery clattering] [woman] Uh, my dear, don't you like the food? I can have them fix something else for you. No, Ma. I like it, Ma. She is feeling too nervous to eat. Well, I think she should be. I wouldn't have given it much thought if you had come in here comfortable and relaxed as if everything was fine. Stella, Dare told us you are a medical doctor. Yes, sir. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Um... do you approve of all this? Do your parents know that you are married to our son? Do they approve of all these, uh-- -Father! -Look. I am talking to the girl, who, if I may add, you dragged into this mess. My parents don't know... yet. But I intend to tell them as soon as I can gather some courage. You asked me what I think, so... I think what we're doing-- What we've done-- is wrong. And I know my parents are very disappointed in me, just as you are with Dare. But I want to plead with you, sir, Ma. Please forgive us. Myself and Dare are so much in love. Please give us some time to make things right. [chuckles] And how do you intend to do that? You know you are already married. There's no doubt that you're a very good girl... well brought up, well cultured. I actually feel proud that, um, my son has demonstrated the wisdom of recognizing a good woman like you. And, well, given different circumstances, I wouldn't have minded to have you as my daughter-in-law. But, well, let us eat up and go to bed. It's getting late. We'll talk tomorrow. Please eat your food. You too. Ah. -I was just coming to see you. -Yes, ma'am. I want to have a word with you. It is about that lady you brought home. -That is why I was coming to... -[Stella: indistinct] My spirit is very troubled. My dear, I think you should redress your steps as soon as possible. -Mummy... -Don't "Mummy" me. I have more life experience, and I am your mother. I can't deceive you. Or do you think I will push you to your death? See... I think you should annul this marriage as soon as possible and let that girl go back home to her parents and confess. Because... Can't you see how terrified she is? See, that girl is scared to death. She's only doing this because she's madly in love with you. -And I'm madly in love with her. -I know. I know. But, see... This is strange. This is not the way it is done. Let God decide for you. Hmm? If God says that girl and yourself are going to be together... then so be it. But if it pleases God to say she's not your wife, he'll surely give you another. Let her go in peace. I beg you my son in God's name. God's time is the best. Please. She's so scared. She's terrified. May you command your children's respect. Please do exactly as I have told you. [PA: man speaking, indistinct] [no inaudible dialogue] [Stella] I told you this won't work. My father has never been angry with me before. [mother speaks in African language] [no audible dialogue] A prince, you say? Yes, sir. His name is, uh, Dare Adeyemi. I have heard that his father is a recognized king somewhere in the southwest. A prince? This is real danger. So... because he is a prince, he has the effrontery to drag my daughter into a marriage without my consent. This is a personal affront to me. I will be in Ilorin tomorrow to deliver your message to Stella, sir. Stella. Stella. It's okay, sir. Stella was deceived. I... I know she will come around. Everything will be okay. [sighs] This is an insult. It's a grave insult. Stella. Augustine. What are you doing here? So this is the prince that cast a spell on Stella's love. What do you want? I have come to check on you. Can we talk in private? I'm sorry? Young man, I want to talk to the lady privately. I have a message from her father. -Go ahead and deliver the message-- -Dare, calm down. Calm down. Please. Did my father really send you? Your father wants you home immediately. Why? Why does my father want to see me? What I don't understand is why you would choose that arrogant prince over me. Why does my father want to see me? Do you know or not? Well, I-I wouldn't know, but I think it has something to do with the way and manner in which you married yourself off to a stranger without his consent. What? What? You thought he would not find out? You don't seem to know the kind of father you have. Anyway, in your interest, Stella, love... get yourself home ASAP. He's not finding your little stunt funny. [engine starts] So what's the issue? My father got to find out we got married. Oh. And he wants to see me. So are you going to go? You know we can go there together. But I wanted to tell him myself. How did he find out so quickly? Well... -we'll figure it out. -[groans] Come on. Hey. We'll figure it out. You know we always do. [groans] [door opens] Greetings to you, Queen. Thank God you are here, High Priest. You are welcome. -Welcome. -Thank you. It is good you are here right now. I have administered all the concoctions you left for him yesterday. None is effective, as you can also see. Not effective? None at all. What do we do now? I have consulted with the oracle, and oyeku was what I saw. The king will not die. -So be it. -He will survive this. -So be it. -He will get back on his feet. -So be it. -There is just one thing to do. We'll take him to the shrine. -Huh? The shrine? -Yes. That's where the ritual will be. It won't take so long to do. He'll return here as soon as he's healed, and we'll all rejoice afterward singing... ♪ Oyeku has averted death From the king ♪ ♪ Oyeku has averted death From the king ♪ But first, we must take him there. Just put your mind at rest. -Please calm down. -Just one day? Just one day. -And you shall rejoice. -Thank you. -Greeting! -Thank you. [phone vibrating, ring tone playing] Hello, Mummy. Hope there's no problem. Ah. [sighs] Has that happened before? Please don't worry too much, Mummy. I will get there tonight or tomorrow morning latest. Please don't worry yourself. Just take it easy. [sighs] Bye. What's the matter? It's my dad. He's sick. Oh, dear. Is it that bad? I don't know, but I have to take a trip out there. You have to go today. But how about the things you have on your schedule? [sighs] I'll get Jire to take care of some for me, and I'll just pick up the rest when I get back. Oh. My mum sounded so worried. I haven't heard her sound like that before. [sighs] [mother] Obadare. -[muttering] -Obadare. Is that the hospital that you're supposed to take him to? What do you expect me to do? Do you expect me to refuse the high priest's decision? Even when he said that the shrine is the only place to conduct the healing? -So that is the only place to do it? -Yes, that's what he said. Please be patient, my dear. Be patient. Obadare. Please, my dear. Be patient. We need to be cautious in this matter. My dear, please be patient. I know what you could go do there if I don't follow you. Your Highness, I speak health into you. May life and vitality return to all parts of your body. [chanting] -We can't go in there. -Watch me. [gasps] Obadare... May life and vitality return to all parts of your body. [chanting] [African language] Obadare. What are you doing here? I've come to take you away from this place, Father. Were you not warned? What are you doing here? I have come to take my dad away from here. What's happening here is a medical issue. And you know this, Father. Didn't your mother tell you that an outsider is not allowed here? -Please allow me-- -High Priest. Your Highness. Please stand, Your Highness. [vibrating, ring tone playing] Huh? [vibrating, ring tone playing] [chimes] [Stella's voice] Hi, Mum. I hope this mail meets you well. I do not even know where to begin. But let me start by saying I'm sorry for the grief that I've caused you and Dad. I'm really sorry to have disappointed you so much. Mum, my heart is breaking as I write these words. I want you to know that I'm ready to do whatever it takes to redress my folly. Please forgive me for ignoring your messages and your calls over the last few weeks. Mum, I just couldn't summon the courage to face you and Dad, but my heart longs for you, and I cannot run away forever. Please give me a few more days to sort myself out, and I will come home. In the meantime, Mum, please plead my case with Dad. I really hope to see you soon, and I love you. He'll be fine. Obadare, what's wrong? You are not looking good. Mum has been calling me to ask when you'll return. What did you tell her? I told her that you have to rest for the next one week ...or two. You're just... Well, I know why they are looking for me. It is about time... to come and declare our traditional cleansing of the town. That's why they want me there. Mm. She said something like that. But, um... I don't think you're ready for that. You just started getting better. You still need a bit more time to rest. I can't allow you go home in this state. You cannot risk your well-being just for the sake of their traditional cleansing or whatever. Obadare, it is not their own cleansing festival. It's our own. It's our tradition. What is ours is undoubtedly ours. You should be showing concern too... because it will soon be your turn. Well... I still can't let you travel like this. That's the bottom line. The network signal today is so terrible. I can't make a connection. -Olori... -It's not connecting. What? Olori, this is not what you should be doing. You seem not to understand the gravity of what is going on. Should this be your major concern? We can't afford to be complacent. We will all find ourselves dead if we do not act fast. May we not come to be that unfortunate. No one wants to die. If we fail to quickly appease the gods, a lot of people will die. God forbid! We will not see death before our time. Lets act very fast to avoid death. High Priest, I just don't know what you want me to do about this matter. Olori! Of course we all forbid death. But truly death has already begun to rear its ugly head. Yes. Haven't you heard of the strange things that have been befalling our people? What strange things? Your Highness, I do not mean to further scare you. A lot is hidden to the folks indoors. A child drowned in the river three days ago. A hunter shot his own first son, thinking he had seen an antelope. Isn't that strange? And we are here forbidding death. If we keep quiet on this, we'll all soon fall victims. We must act very fast because no one can tell how much worse it'll get. No one! Fellow chiefs, let me back you up with an analogy. The beetle sets out to cause trouble. It decides to attack the cock. Soon the cock swallows the beetle. The cock also falls prey to the fox, who wastes no time to swallow the cock. The fox in turn falls prey to the lion, who also swallows it. The lion was killed by a hunter, who, after butchering the lion, finds the fox. He cuts the fox and finds the cock. When he cuts open the cock, the beetle flies out and declares, "I told you I will cause so much trouble." -Isn't that the case? -True. Are we not in this mess because of our king? He's the cause of all these troubles. Lets give this a thought. Fellow chiefs... Please let's quickly look for a solution so that we can put an end to this deadly scourge. Wait a moment. I can't seem to understand you all. What kind of nonsense are you saying? No! No! Why are you talking like this? Maybe because we're fools. Do you want to tell me you don't know why the king is not here? We don't seem to... This is quite surprising. What has King Adeyemi done wrong? Has he ever rejected your counsels before now? Does he not listen to you? If it wasn't that important, wouldn't he be here right now? We all know how important it is for him to be away from home. You are all speaking like he doesn't answer to your call. [African language] Do you all not share in his wealth? Why do you speak like this? Has he robbed you of any valuables? Why all these talks? -I'm quite disappointed in you all. -Olori, please take it easy. No, no, no, no! Don't tell me to take it easy! I was just trying to call His Highness. And you are here threatening us with death. -What? -You are not in agreement with us. I am quite disappointed with you all, because you are only friends when the going is good. You forget the good times so easily. -What? -You have taken this beyond reason. -Olori... -Yes. Yes? This is too much. When you are done with your deliberation, let me know. -[man] Hey! -Olori! Fellow chiefs, we can't afford to be moved. Yes. We will not allow this day to affect our resolution. -Yes. -Let's leave it as it is. We understand. Let's watch and see. -There you are. -Hey. Well, I have to go. -Okay. -I'm in a hurry. I had to let you know. Just make sure he doesn't leave here until I get back. -Okay. -It's just two days. Okay? When I get back, I'll take him home myself. All right. Don't worry. I have it covered. -Thank you. -Make sure you take care of yourself. I'll try. Love you. -See you. Love you, baby. -See you. Love you too. [man chanting] I salute you all fathers of our land. [chanting continues] O Land! Hear now the matter of our king Adeyemi! -Hello, Your Highness. -Ah, Stella. How are you? I'm well, thank you, sire. I hope you're feeling better. Oh, yes, of course. I'm fine, thank you. Where is Obadare? Oh, he was called last night to be a part of a special flight training. I see. We were only discussing my return to Sapati only last night. When will he be back? Um, he has promised to take you back as soon as he returns, but I think he should be back in two days. -Two days? -Yes. I see. He should come right back home! You should have no peace until you are back home. [chanting] Come right home! O land! O water! [chanting] King Adeyemi, if you drink water, you think of home. If you walk on the land, you remember home! [gasps] Stella! Yes, Your Highness. Take me to Sapati. But why, Your Highness? I want you to take me to Sapati now. I want you to take me to Sapati now! Maybe I should call-- Now! [man chanting] My dear... tell me what happened. Why did you get on the road so late in the day? Huh? Where's Obadare? Oh, come on, my daughter. Don't you want to talk to me? Come. Come, come, come. Come, dear. It's all right. Take care. Oh. Where is Obadare? I think I should leave now. No. You can't leave tonight. It-It's late as it is. Come on. Stay the night, and then first thing in the morning tomorrow, you leave, okay? Come on. Come with me. [man chanting] [all chanting] [chanting continues] When the night falls, we give it its due! [chanting] [woman sobbing] Mum... Your Highness. Where is Stella? [sobbing continues] When I called you, you told me she was here. I don't understand what's going on. Where is she? [sobbing] Obadare! [sobbing] My son... Stella... is dead. I don't understand. Make me understand. [continues sobbing] So your evil god... has come to claim my Stella. The [indistinct] that you people worship... [speaking African language] [woman wailing] It wasn't like that! It wasn't like that! Thanks for coming down here for me, Jire. I really appreciate it. But... her parents. I know. I know. Who's going to break the news to them, and how? I don't know. We'll find something. We'll find a way around it. All I know is I'm not involving my parents. Or even anyone from Sapati. [sighs] I don't know. Your Highness. Your Highness. Your Highness, strange things are happening in our land! Things that even your royal ancestors never witnessed. [continues in African language] Your child destroyed the sacred shrine. Nobody has done that before. This is a taboo, which comes with dire consequences. Your son has angered the gods. -High Priest... -Your Highness? Get out of my palace. What did you say? Get out of my palace! -That I should get out? -Get out of my palace! Get out! Did I hear you well? Your son has angered the gods, Your Highness. Your child deserves what is coming to him. Your Highness. I will leave now, but this is bad... Get out of my palace! Your Highness. So be it. But this is not the end. Your Highness, please take it easy. Please take it easy. [man] Young man, who are you, and what brings you to our home today? Sir, Ma... I... My name is Obadare Adeyemi. I was, uh-- I am-- Stella's friend. Stella? Sir... -I'm sorry. -Hmm? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. -I'm so sorry. -Sorry for what, now? -[sobs] -Why is he crying? I'm so sorry, sir. I'm so sorry. Please, why are you sorry now? Can you get a hold of yourself and speak? -What's wrong with him? -Um... Uh... -I'm so sorry, sir. -What? Well? -[sobs] -Stella... Stella... We-- We lost Stella. How? Where? Lost Stella...? What did you say? You-You lost Stella how? Huh? Well, what? Lost Stella...? Well? Stella-- Stella died. [wailing] No! No! What did you say? My God! [wailing] Where is her body now? It's in a mortuary. Which mortuary? So I can arrange to go and bring my baby home. In Ilorin, sir. I've arranged for the body to be taken home immediately. [wailing] Thank you. -[mother] No, no, no, no, no! -You may go now. I'm sorry, sir. [wailing continues] Where have you been? I've been looking for you. Well, I just have to see to the body, get it ready. And I wanted to let you know I'm leaving soon. You are going with the body? Yes. I... I don't think that is a wise decision. I'm sorry? Look, can't you arrange an ambulance or something, -give them the parents' address or-- -What are you saying? Remember the last time we traveled to the east... -Mm-hmm. -...to see Stella's parents? -The look on that man's face-- -Which man? Stella's father? Yes, Stella's father. Look, I just think this is not a wise decision. I don't think you should go with the body. Trust me. I'm surprised you would even suggest something like that. This is a woman I loved. A woman I married and is dead because of me. Look, I know all of this, okay, and we're on the same page. -I just feel that-- -You know what? I don't need you or anyone to come with me, but I'm taking Stella's body, and I will pay my respects at that funeral. Look, Dare... Dare... Dare... [woman wailing] Let me go and see. No! No! [wailing] [people wailing] Well, I guess that's it then, young man. Thank you for bringing our daughter home to us. You are free to go. But, sir... -I would like to be at the funeral. -No. Sir, please. I must. Young man, you are not welcome at the funeral. So please leave. Now! All right, sir. [people wailing] [woman] Why? Why? [clamoring] Somebody help! Somebody help me! [exclaiming] [out-of-service tone] [out-of-service tone] [sighs] This is Jire, Ma. Dare's friend. Yes, Ma. I just want to ask, Is Dare is with you? There's no problem, Ma. I will like to come and see you and Your Highness. It is something I have to discuss with you in person. I will come over before nightfall. Thank you. [sighs] Your Highness. Mummy. Like I said, I came because... Look, I'm a bit concerned. The first thing is, I tried to warn Dare not to go with the corpse to her parents'. But... he would not listen. He decided he would go alone. [Dare's father] I see. You mean he went all by himself? Without telling us? Without informing us? -Yes, Your Highness. -Did you hear that? I also advised him to let us arrange with an ambulance. We can send some other people. Or better still, I can go, and also to inform you folks, but he didn't listen still. My major concern now is that... he was due back yesterday. I have since yesterday been trying his phone. His number is not connected. When did he travel? -Three days ago. -I am finished! My God. My God. How do we tackle this? You, come. Go and call all my chiefs. Tell them to come down here. I want to see them now. Please. Jire... [speaking African language] Why did you do it? Why did you kill my wife? You killed... my woman. You killed my wife! You dared cross me, and you think you can get away with it? I am about to teach you a lesson you will never forget, Prince! [speaking African language] Get him into the box. Get him into the box fast! [man] Please. [speaking African language] [groaning] [speaking African language] Help me. No, no, no! Where's the hammer? Give me the nails. Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! I will send you to hell! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! -[muffled shouting] -Bastard! [muffled] Somebody help! Somebody help me! Hey! Hey! Hey! Please... Please let me out! [gasps] Hey! I will send you to hell myself. Since you decided to snatch my wife... you shall marry Stella from the grave. [muffled shouts] [shouts] Please don't leave me here! Let me out! Listen to me. Anybody you find around the vicinity... -If you find anybody around here-- -Kill him. -Anybody close to him-- -Kill him. -Anyone at all-- -At your command. [chattering] Welcome, welcome, welcome. Oh, no, no, no, no. Please, please be seated. Please. [man] Thank you. Ah! -You're welcome. -[all] Thank you. Good evening, Sire Maxwell. [Dominic] Good evening. And, uh, to what good fortune do I owe the pleasure of this visit from such important personalities as yourselves? May the Almighty comfort you and your family. -[men] Amen. -Thank you. Oh, please, please, please. How very uncivil of me. I did not even offer you some refreshment. Um, Oyenosa, please get us some refreshments. Um, please, please don't worry. It's not necessary. -Nonsense. Please, please, please. -Please don't worry. It is not every day that dignitaries from a distant land come under my roof. Please don't offend me by saying no to some refreshments. Please. Well, thank you very much for receiving us so warmly at such a short notice. And please accept our heartfelt condolences... on the unfortunate passage of your young daughter. [sighs] Thank you. What can we say? What can we do? -Who are we to question the Almighty? -Mm. The Lord giveth, and the same Lord taketh away. So says the Good Book. Ah, yes. By the way, how is the young prince holding up? I hope he's taking this whole tragedy well in his stride. Sadly, it is because of the prince that we're here. He has not been seen since he came here for the past five days. Good heavens. -Five days? -Five days. That's not possible. Please, we are very worried about him. No one has seen him since he brought her home to rest. My goodness. The prince is not here. [exclaims] [man] That's incredible. What would he still be doing here since five days? He left the very same day he came. Everybody saw him leave. [muttering] -Arinze, Pascal. -[men] Yes, sir. Please, please, please. Please come. Come, come, come, come. -Sir? -Yes, you remember the young prince who brought the remains of Stella to us? Very well, sir. Did he spend the night in this town? No, sir. He left that very day, sir. -He left that very day? -[both] Yes, sir. -He did not spend the night here? -No, sir. He left that same day. -What shall we tell the king? -What's happening here? This is a dilemma. This is strange. What's happening here? This is a tragedy. Your Highness, we will do everything within our powers to make sure that we find the prince. -We will leave no stone unturned. -Please. Find my son for me. -Do you want my enemies to laugh at me? -God forbid. No, Your Highness. Please find my prince. Find Obadare for me, please! I've an informer who lives in the east, and they're already on top of the matter. We will do everything possible to make sure we find him, Your Highness. Gentlemen, can you please follow us to the location? Certainly, sir. Your Highness, what happened to that young lady, Stella? -We have rumors coming into our ears. -Rumors? What kind of rumors? She had an accident and died, and you are telling me you heard rumors. What rumors? Find my son for me, please! Your Highness, there's more to this story. We have suspicion that that accident was not actually an accident. What? Officer. Officer. I am an eyewitness. It happened right before my eyes. [horn honks] [man] We have no idea what she was running away from or what was after her that caused the accident. We also tried our very best to save her life, but it was rather unfortunate that she died on the spot. And we could not prevent this tragedy. I don't think you should suspect any foul play in this matter. If that's the case, we'll carry on with our investigation. -Your Highness, I'll keep you posted. -Well done. [door opens, shuts] Who is there? Who is there? [muffled] Who is there? Look here. He will rot here. [laughing] You don't know what you got yourself into. It is almost 8:00 a.m., and you are done. [groans] Who is there? Help. [gasps] [gasps] [no audible dialogue] I know you guys are keeping watch diligently. -No problem. We are on guard steady. -Diligently? Very well. -Did anybody come around? -Nobody. Not a single soul. If anyone come close to this end-- We will behead him. -Sure you're clear? -Very clear. -And you? -Very well. [cell phone rings] -Hello, sir. -[Dominic] Yes. The police authorities just left my place now. And I'm sure they're coming to you. Of course, you know what to say. Deny everything. Okay, sir. Do we remove the body? No, no, no. You don't need to move the body. The forest is obscure enough. Okay, sir. All right, I'll talk to you later. [sighs] -Okay. See that? -Check. All right, what you need to do is, you unlock that. Change the filter, okay? Then you tighten these bolts and then close that. All right, boss. [cell phone rings] Missed calls. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is this Jire? Yes, this is Jire. Who's this? Please, you people need to come back. Who's speaking? Come to where? What you're looking for is in the forest here. Forest-- Who's speaking? Please, come back with the police. Hurry. Hello? Hello? Forest... No way. [line ringing] -Hello? -[man] Hello? -Is that a DPO? -Yes, please. [horn honks] [birds calling] [man] Police officer! Freeze! Do not move! Where is he? Where is he? -Where is he? -Stop! Come on, help! Open it! [exclaiming] Dare, Dare! Dare. Dare. [chattering, shouting] He's still breathing. Can we get him out of here, please? [chattering] Let's put him here! Is it your custom to attend the funerals of your victims? You must be Stella's father. We are sorry for what has happened. Please accept our condolences. Keep your condolences to yourselves. What do you want? We have not come here to fight. We have only come looking for our son. Please. Wherever you might have put him, just bring him up. Did your oracle tell you you'd find your son at my daughter's funeral? Look, we are sorry for your loss. We know that you must have suffered a lot. But, please, we have reasons to believe that our son is still here. -[Olori] Yes. -You murderous heathen clan. What? Wherever your son is, may he rot in that place, never to be found. [people exclaim] Every parent prays for his children to bury him, but I'm here today burying my daughter because of your son! And you come here telling me you-you think your son is here? -Bring out the coffin. -[wailing] [mother] I am finished! I am finished! [wailing] [keening wail] [wailing continues] Jire? [whispering, indistinct] Jire! [wailing] [wailing, exclaiming] Take it easy. What have they done to my son? Just let me take care of that! Let me just-- Oh, my God! -Oh! -Please take it easy. Just let me take care of my son! [wailing, exclaiming] Obadare! My son! I just want to look at him! I just want to look at him! [mother] I just-- I just-- See what we've done? Why? Why? Why do we always, in the name of tradition, ruin lives? Tradition is meant for the people, not people as sacrifice at the altar of tradition. Why? [mother] Just let me look at his face! -[wailing] -See what you've done? See what you have done? And they found him there! They found him there! [wailing continues] [both wailing] [man] Mr. Augustine, you are under arrest. Mr. Maxwell, you are also under arrest, and you have the right to remain silent, for whatever you say may be used against you in a court of law. Madam, thanks for the information. Let's go. Can I pay my last respects to my daughter? Go on. [people wailing] [wailing continues] See what you have done to our children? You know I love you, right? And I always will. [no audible dialogue]
