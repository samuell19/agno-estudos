Where have you studied? Your job or a hobby? Whatever you like. Have you understood? Yes. Please, start. Slowly. - What? - Kajol Sarkar. Oh, go and sit there. Why is no one guarding the door? Hey, give me that bag. Give me the bag. Write down your name here. - Keep it. Rolling. - Come on. Tell us your name. Srabony Barua. - Look here. The camera is here. Now, talk about yourself. Today, I woke up very early in the morning. I generally wake up late on the other days. 6:00 AM to 6:30 AM Today, I woke up at 5:10 AM. There is a small playground in front of our house. People go there for morning walks. And there is a flower bed in the middle. And there is a Shiva temple in one corner of the playground. There was no one out there, early in the morning. I saw a woman, in front of the Shiva temple. She was standing alone, with folded hands. Hey, you are narrating a story. Say something about yourself. No. I was the one who saw the woman in the morning. Okay, fine. Next question. What will you do if you receive fifty lakh rupees? Speak up. I want to do many things. Should I say it all? Tell us a few. My daughter... For her education. And, my daughter wants to travel. England. America. Africa. And you? Won't you do something for yourself? Hey, you are the one who will play and win the fifty lakhs. Don't you have any desire of your own? What is that? I will also travel with my daughter. Fine. Thank you. Please, get up. Take that off. - Yes, one minute. Come. Please, write down your name and address here. Come. You please, come forward. - Hmm. Put this on. Tell us your name and then... - Write your name here. - Here? And tell us what will you do if you win fifty lakh rupees? - Hmm. Okay? - Hmm. - Hey, just check on the sound. Just say one, two, three. - One, two. Yeah, okay. Rolling. - Tell us. I work in a Chicken chimney... I mean Kitchen chimney company. Assistant manager. I might become the manager, next year. And, I like, the reality shows that air on the television. I watch most of them. I don't miss them. Very... I mean they are very exciting. I mean, I draw courage to face my real-life struggles. That is what I think. And actually, what would happen earlier was that, people would tidy their homes and cabinets. - Hey! But now? - Oh, shit! - Hey! Oh! Sorry! Yes, and... Now what? - Bag. Earlier, people would tidy their homes and cabinets. But now, everyone is trying to clean up their lives. Have you seen, so many people are waiting here. Why have they locked the room? [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] Excuse me. - What did they ask you, sister? No. - Hey, nothing much. Just an introduction. Where do we stay, what do we do etc. 'Exactly.' 'And what about your general knowledge?' 'After all, you will sit in front of such a great star.' This is the greatest game show in Bengal. Come and participate. This is the best game show in Bengal. Oh, brother! Oh, brother! - You will make it, don't worry! Will everyone get a chance, brother? - Yes, everyone will get a chance. 'This is our request to you.' 'This is the last session of the day.' 'Please, come in a queue.' Excuse me. Hello. This is your handkerchief. It was lying below that table. Thank you. - No problem. 'We are closing the gate number two.' 'Please, note. We are closing gate number two.' 'We request all of you,' 'please, enter through gate number three.' 'Please queue up outside gate number three.' Brother, give me some nuts. 'The greatest reality game show in Bengal.'

'Please stick to the queue.' 'Please, do not break the queue.' - Please, come. Is it hurting a lot? Oh, dear! Are you carrying water? I have it in my bag. - I'll take it out. Let me see? Nothing will happen. Will you be able to walk? Yes, I will manage. I hope you haven't fractured your arm? You could not eat your nuts. Oh, not a big deal. Oh, dear. We will have to do something. I will just go home. How will you go home? Brother, where is the game show audition? - That way. Hey, is that how you ask for directions. - That's okay. Where do you stay? - I stay in Dum Dum. I will get a bus. - It will take you two hours. Brother, is there a doctor? Is there a doctor's clinic somewhere here? - Go that way. Hop in. - I will manage. Hey, get in. Get in. Otherwise, you will get an infection. Get in. Be careful. Drive on. I am Kajol Sarkar. Yes, I know. They called out your name along with mine. Although, you don't know my name. I am Srabony Barua. Should I carry this? Will it help? So, what did you say? What will you do if you win fifty lakh rupees? I said whatever came to my mind. Same here. My mind had stopped working. I got into some trouble in the morning today. Yes, tell me. No, it's alright. How much do you need? Okay, I will withdraw and keep it. Alright. "As our eyes meet." It was a bundle of five hundred rupee notes. Do you know it had fifty thousand rupees. 'Write it down. Twice a day after food.' 'Okay?' 'Give me the money.' Hey, number seven! Come on. - Srabony Barua, go inside, please. [Indistinct chatter] Please, come in. Do we have to get an X-Ray done? There is a bruise here. There is money in my wallet. Oh, that is not a problem. Sir, can you spare two minutes. Thank you, sir. The bag. 'Number ten. Juthi Khil!' 'Sister, may I make a request.' 'Please, do not negotiate.' 'Buy what you like for rupees thirty. One price, thirty rupees.' Wait. Let me see, what is the best way to get to Dumdum from here. No, it's okay. I will go home. Thank you so much. This is for you. Won't you have tea? Come on, let's have some tea. It's 3 PM. Please, come. What happened to your money? Oh, that wasn't my money. That is Antara's money. And that is the problem. Have you asked the other members of the family? I don't have anyone. And you? Husband and daughter. Today, I am also, in a fix. What happened? Hey, Buri! Buri, don't be late. It's 8:30 AM. She refused to go to school. Crying and chaos. Her father is not here. Who knows where he brought her from? Today is not a good day. Actually, she is a very stubborn girl. She fusses around with food. I have no choice but to get that particular vase for her. How old is she? Twelve. Where will you get an identical flower vase? Where did the money go from inside the cabinet? Cabinet, trunk, below the bed... It's nowhere. Is Antara, a friend of yours? She will be my wife after another two months. I had worked hard to save money. However, I have managed a little. Who is it? What do you want? It's me. - Oh, come up here. It is not possible to sell second-hand goods at a good price. These days most people take pictures on mobile phones. I'll give you ten thousand rupees. What are you saying? Just ten thousand? How do I explain it to you? It will lie at home. No one will buy it. No, no, at least quote a reasonable price. Hey, I gave you a good price. No one will give you more than this. - That is because I am in need, otherwise, would I have sold it? Don't you know how hard I worked, saved and then bought it. Oh, dear! I am quoting the final price. Now, don't negotiate. Okay. Now, you may go. No, listen to what I am saying. Listen, can't you manage with fifteen thousand rupees? You have worked so hard to save money. The fifty thousand will just go. Hey, no. No. I am saying it for your betterment. Yes. How come you have such a big amount, in your bag? - There you are. Please, have. - I won't eat. Hey, eat it. After all, you haven't eaten all day. Otherwise, you will fall ill. Oh! Can you tell me what happened? We had to face so much for this greed for fifty lakh rupees. Your hand. And I wasted a complete workday. Has the pain in your arm subsided? That's good. Come inside the house. This place will go underwater in a while. Oh, no! - Yes. There is tremendous waterlogging here. Another fifteen minutes, and the children will start playing with paper boats. Really, do children still, play with paper boats? - Yes. Come in. Come on. - Come on, brother. Come inside. This way, please. "If I think," "I am just fine." "Life is good." "Things are just fine." "They got stuck in the rain." Open room number eleven. - Sure. We will sit here. - Yes, yes, it's fine in here. How will you sit here? People will come and go. You can go up and sit upstairs. Go. I will send some tea. Let's go. Come on. Do I have to sign anywhere? No, no. Just give me two hundred rupees. "My dreams hang in mid-air while the clock goes on ticking.' "Be it morning, dusk," "or night," "that which is destined to happen, is happening." "Life is good." "If I think," "I am just fine." "Life is good." "Things are just fine." The bathroom is right here. Please, call me if you need something? I'll leave my bag here. - Hmm. Potato fritters, chicken fry or 'makha muri.' What should I get you? No, no, we don't need anything. Is the bathroom clean? - Yes. The way it's raining! I hope we don't end up spending the night here. Maybe someone will murder us? Are you so scared of dying? The soul neither dies nor can it take birth. Did you read the Gita inside the washroom. They told us we can order food. Fritters or 'muri makha.' Tell me, if you wish to eat. Won't you tell Antara that the money is not there? If I can arrange for the entire amount, then what is the need to tell? That means, the lies will remain in between the two of you? Though, it should not be so, in between husband and wife? What will you do about your daughter's flower vase? [Indistinct chatter] This is not from here, sister. It is from Khurja, Uttar Pradesh. Can you order and get one for me? No. No one will be able to get one for you, here. If you know someone who is travelling to Delhi or Aligarh? Then give it to that person. This is a very commonly available design in Khurja. You will get it very easily. How much do you have in your bag? Fifty thousand. Antara did not call you even once during the entire day? No. She dropped me a message. What happened at the audition for fifty lakhs? I did not inform at home. There is no waterlogging! Come on, let us just leave. Hey. You have spent a lot since morning. Hey, it's okay. - No. It's not alright. - There you are. The story did not end. Which story? Mine and yours. Oh, mine is just... I gave fifteen thousand to Antara today, and I will see about the rest. But your issue will not be resolved so easily. No, I think I will get it, by the day after tomorrow. The flower vase? - Yes. I will fly to Delhi tomorrow early in the morning. And then another four hours to Khurja. I would like to encash my fixed deposit. Just fill this form and, sign on the backside. Yeah. Listen, Antara. Yes, I have withdrawn the cash. I am going somewhere at the moment. You will get it by evening. Yes, of course. Yes, yes. Listen, make all the arrangements. You can leave, tomorrow morning. I cannot leave my daughter alone. So, Antara is travelling tomorrow morning. I will pay for everything. Her air ticket, hotel etc. And she will take ten thousand for doing the job. Oh, she is also, Antara? She is the same person. I have known your bride-to-be since we were children. Huh! What rubbish. She is not my wife. Hey, we used to live in the same neighbourhood. However, I did not know that she is getting married to you. Hey, why are you mixing the two stories? This is so strange? She hasn't told you about me, isn't it? This is one of her bad habits. She keeps secrets. Listen, I have known Antara for two years. She is not such a girl. And I have known her for twenty years. Each time she broke up with a guy, I am the one who supported her. Nonsense! What rubbish are you talking about? Hey, please ask. Praddut, Sowmalya... - Rot! They are all her ex-boyfriends. And then, what is that fellow's name. Lalit Singh. Hey, will you stop? What silly tales! - Hey, hey, listen. Come here. Wait. Yeah, what? This is not mine. Take it. "Heart..." "There is a heart within the heart." "And deep within that is another heart." "A known home." "Everything is chaotic within the house." "Another house..." "A, lone mirror is swaying in the wind." "Search, search, search!" "Wipe off the dust and filth." "Heart..." "Because I want to see myself," "fly with my new wings." "The desires in my heart," "have changed their colours." "Just before dawn breaks," "someone wakes up in a dream." "I weave," "a new tale with my words." "I dream of the skies and flowers," "and find a way to break out of my mundane existence." "And then I wake up in the morning." "I look at my heart in a new light." "The hidden desires of my heart..." "Alone," "in secret." "Let all my loneliness burn and dissolve." "Let me protect my heart." "Let me forget those faces." "My lost heart." "There is a heart within the heart." "And deep within that is another heart." So, what is it with you? Why did you keep your mobile off all day? I had one meeting after another. So, what is the problem in telling your son? Don't you know how he behaves if you get late? Why are you so late? I was caught up somewhere. I called you so many times. It was switched off. Will you eat or have you already eaten? Do I ever eat outside? Krishna, heat the food. What is this? Did you fall? - No. Why do you have a bandage on your arm? - It's nothing. Was your mobile switched off today? Quite a few people had called from your office. Samiran da. Mr. Nandi. Where was your meeting? Mahesh Tala, Bata Nagar. Oh, dear! To attend an office meeting, you went so far, alone? New client. The office and factory is on that side. Srinivas said, he doesn't know a thing. He will know only after the site is approved. Please. I am not spying on you. Okay! Kahon was getting upset. And so I called Srinivas. I won't eat. - Why? I am in a fix. Hello. Who are you? Phone. Who is it? I don't know. He won't tell his name. Hello. Fine. What's up with you? Why have you called? Again you have closed your eyes? Please, focus on what you are doing. Stupid. What is the meaning of this? Hey! My geography paper did not go well. Are your results out? Not yet. Why didn't you do well? Didn't you study? Now, you will have to study all the subjects. Later you can focus on what you like. - Literature. Will you teach me after studying literature, how to weave a fantastic tale? - Great story? Do you know, that is everything. When there is no story in one's life, we weave our own tale. Have you understood? - Hmm. All this unhappiness and chaos. They are destroying this, breaking that. Can you tell me what are we latching on to for hope? - Story? Absolutely. Because there is a story, there is, a design. This lack of solidarity, in the midst of that, we have some control. Have you understood? - Hmm. I will teach you geography from today. And what will you teach me after learning literature? How to tell a great story? Hey, I don't like the poach. Should I boil an egg for you? No. Give me oats. - Okay. Are you going to work, today? The ones used to running. - They will run! Have you seen the CBSE results of Kahon's school, this year? Is it very bad? I have been telling you for two years to change the school. Hey! He is just in class six. Yeah, so, after this no school will take him. Why don't you understand? Now, I will have to take the initiative. Do it for yourself. What should I do? A job or a business. Whatever you like. And who will look after Kahon? I will get you the oats. So, the people who go out and work, don't they look after their children? Don't be silly. This is a dangerous age. So, which age is not dangerous? Stupid! And if your phone is switched off today, I'll kill you. Hey, you! Sit, sit, sit. Will you be late today, as well? Do I come late, every day? Do I? When will you be back? By 7 PM. Morning, ma'am. - Morning. I know that, and that is why my company is the best. How are you, ma'am? - Fine, thank you. - Good morning. Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. Good morning ma'am. - Morning. Come in. - Madam, we are all set. I am just coming. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present before you, this unique machine. It increases your efficiency. It's time saving. It's... - Just a second. - Good morning, ma'am. You may start. - Yeah. This machine produces three types of double chamber tea bags. As you can see here, the filter tea bag can be wrapped, either with an outer paper envelope, or a aroma protection foil. Now, this is something very unique in this product. As we can see, the threads are knotted securely, from the top of the bag, by two-needle stitches. You can see them. One. This is on the left. Thank goodness, at least, he looks interesting from behind. Ugh! - This is a very important part of our system. Sir, this bus's power is quite less. Who knows what they have given us? Is it 1200 Watts? - Yes. I will get it replaced by tomorrow. Sir the fibre class clips are 16 by 24. And the exterior MW is four inches. The positive is .52 and the negative is .26 sir. It's not matching. Just check the measurement on the strip. The correction is done, sir. It is down here. The plan we had for phase three, why don't you get that? Okay, sir. - Come on. - We will get that. Ashish. It's a big investment. - Hmm. Please, boycott the year-wise financial burden. Fine. - So, our, existing machines... How will we dispose them off? I mean, will we get any returns from those? We can get good returns from the new ones, ma'am. Okay, okay. Alright. In that case, work it out. And, hurry up. Okay, fine. - We must not delay this. We must not delay this at all. Pit chamber pack. Good morning. - Morning. So, what's going on around us? Middle-aged married woman, are getting closer to their physical instructors. What has got into your head, now? What will get into my head? So strange! Take a look at this article. The unbearable loneliness of the privileged life. Read it. You are never up-to-date about anything. Look. All over urban India, privileged women are struggling with loneliness. They are educated. They are married at the right time. They have money. They have it all. Yet everyone is so lonely. Isn't it? And, see. And a professional marriage counsellor has said that, many of these women carry on with their personal trainers. Did you also, not have one? A young boy. He was your yoga teacher? Oh, no. I am confusing you with someone else. Whatever. So, basically, the physical barrier, that is broken. So, it gets easier. Do you get it? - Hmm. Are only the women, lonely? I don't believe that. No. Everyone is lonely. I mean, look at me. They are on Facebook all night, like pictures and mast*rb**e! Oh, my God! - What happened? - Ugh! I cannot manage this girl any longer. Hey! Hey, come on. Get out! - What is this? Go out and do whatever you like. - What? Hey, why? I mean... - Shut up! What are you doing? Hey, my iPad. Bag! Ugh! Hello. Yes, tell me. Hey, first, tell me why do you want to meet? We can take time out to talk. Okay, fine. It's right here. [Indistinct chatter] Last week... - So, then, will you let me know? [Indistinct] Good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon. Hi. After how long did he call? - Who? Your husband. - Oh? About seven to eight years. - This table ma'am. Thank you. What does he want? Apparently, nothing. I have come to Kolkata for two days. I would like to meet you, once. He called me at home yesterday and today at work. Will you meet him? - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. 'Chello' kebab? Will you meet him? What else should I order with the 'Chello' kebab? Fresh lime or Mojito? Will you meet that man? No. Fine. Mojito with no sugar syrup. - Okay, ma'am. And more mint leaves. Thank you. - Thank you. Ma'am, may I? What are you looking at? Look at that man. Right there. The one with packets in both hands. He is a distant cousin brother. Till some years back, he used to work with our company? He started fighting on behalf of the labours. That's it. Not only did he lose his job, my uncle taught my elder uncle such a lesson, that he will never be able to work in a tea company ever. Wherever he tried to work, false allegations about him reached the company. Our company had employed a dedicated group to do this job. Now, he works for a small printing press. Why is our company, so revengeful? What is the use of money and power, if you cannot take revenge? Oh, wow! Facebook? This is for you, on behalf of the company. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wish you all the best for the project. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Arya, now, you may say a few words. Oh, dear! I cannot articulate my thoughts and speak properly. I invariably go off on a tangent. Anyway. I'll try to make a short speech. So, I joined this company three years back. And, I used to be a very different human being. I was uninspired. I was under-confident. I was very short-tempered. Also, I was very fickle minded. And there was this one person, who changed my life. And she is right there. Thank you for teaching me, how to be patient. For expanding my horizon. For inspiring me to do better. So, thank you for being there in my life. Thank you. Also, I'd like to thank everyone. Thank you for the beautiful gifts and the flowers. I mean, I don't know, what I would have done without you all. Because after I ended up in this company, everything was new to me. But the journey has been incredible. Hello. - And, I had no experience. Yes, I am speaking. Yes. Greetings. 'I have taken too much of your time.' Why are you calling me about this issue? 'Thanks Arya, for your lovely speech.' I am sure you know my designation? This is an accounts department issue. Why are you calling me? Don't ever do this. What is wrong with the accounts? You have not released some dealer's payment and he is calling me. Who? What is the name? There is no need to get him into trouble. Hey, no. Last week, I sanctioned all the payments. Brother has stopped the payments. We won't be able to release any cheque before the year ends. That is why family business means, lifelong drudgery. Ugh! - So, leave it. In your generation, no one but you showed interest in the family business. Everyone has chosen their own profession. Had everyone taken the responsibility together, then us uncles, would have left all this long back. Where would you have gone? To the Himalayas? Hey, listen. Listen. I have something to say to you. Come here. So where is your brilliant assistant off to? She is going for a research programme in Texas. I see. Good. Rajat has come to Kolkata. Have you met him? He called me. He has created some new trouble, in the money market, stocks etc. Anyway, that can be resolved. We are there, after all, he is your husband. I get it. He wants to patch-up with you. And I suggest, you should give him a chance. Talk it out with him. After all, you are not getting any younger. You pay your dealers, and I will look into this. "Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes," "snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes." "Silver white winters that melt into spring," "These are a few of my favourite things." "When the dog bites, when the bee stings..." "When I am feeling sad," "I simply remember my favourite thing, which is you." "And then I don't feel so bad." No, I will not meet him. We have stayed with each other for so many years. Hello? We were together for nine years. Our wavelengths don't match at certain basic places, Rajat. And we will never have anything in common. Please, don't call me again. Hey, Rani! - Yes? What is it? I can't hear a thing. Don't you charge it or what? I keep it on the charger. Where is it charged? I can't hear a thing. In the next ten years, Indian real estate will cross a hundred million dollars. Play. The way your furniture is wrapped in paper, it looks like installation art! Everything will settle down. Just a matter of two days. Kajol, there is eight per cent accelerated GDP growth. Rise in disposable income. And increase demand for quality residential real estate. Why don't you? - Hey, Gupta! Will you stop? Like the other day, I will open your fly zip! Hey! Hey! What is this? Hey, listen, today it's just us, okay. Our wives are also, not here. - Mine is. I have a wife. - Hey, right there! I will get up there! Do you know, if I could own a car like that. It is an awesome piece. - 'Hey, bootlicker!' 'What did you say?' The price is about 1.24. - 'Am I a bootlicker?' I am a bootlicker? - What else? - You! You are a bootlicker! Now, look at these. Hey, will you stop? - Just don't talk rubbish! After an accident... - 'You are calling me a bootlicker?' Keep quiet! - No, say what I want to know? All the FAQs about the car. - [Indistinct] Oh! Bangla medium. How would you know? What do you mean by abuse? - Hey! Hey! How dare you call me a bootlicker? - What is all this? Why does this happen every day? - What a nuisance! What don't you tell him? - Shut up! Disgusting! Darn! Will you click a few pictures of me? Hey. Sure. Someone has offered me a modelling job on Facebook. Genuine? A lot of useless people do such things. He is also, probably useless. Initially, he said it is an ad for inner-wear. - Okay. All sorts of rubbish. Will you take the pictures for me? - Hmm. Up until now, all the pictures you have taken of me, I have kept all of them in my album. Good. If I ever organise an exhibition, I will beg you to lend them to me. Do you love me? But you fear to say anything because I am your friends' wife. You have lost your mind, haven't you? Are you on drugs again? Will you sleep with me once? Let go. What nonsensical talk! Coward. I will come with you, today. Where? Anywhere. But you have school? I won't go. Why? I am not feeling good. When will grandma, come? Sunday. There are times when we don't like to do stuff. But we have to do them. As they say in that poem... I slept and dreamt that life was a beauty. I woke and found that life is duty. This Sunday, I and you will go out very early and bring grandma home. This Sunday. - Hmm. Your grandma has holidays on Monday and Tuesday. Then she will go back on Wednesday morning? Well, she will have to go when the school re-opens. After all, grandma is the headmistress. After she retires next year, she will stay with us longer. Where is the passport? Right here. Okay. I will really miss you. Me too. Do you know, there is something in you, and maybe no one knows that. But that provides you sustenance. And that is the greatest thing in your life. Come on, you better go inside. You are getting late. Call me once you reach Delhi. Okay. Don't forget. - Yes, ma'am. Love you. I love you. I love you. Love you. Love you. Go on. Sister-in-law. Oh, my! It's you? Come in. How are you? And you all? As expected. Sit. - Hmm. Today, he is at home. Should I leave? No, no. What is that? Sit. Does he still, write. No. At times I force him to sit, then he writes a line or two. Who is it? Has she come here to poke fun at us? Did I not forbid you? What are you doing? You should see her attitude in the office. Why are you acting crazy? For what her uncles did to you, why are you holding her responsible for that? Have I ever misbehaved with you in office? She is the God of four hundred workers. Managing Director! I will not go from here. I will stay for as long as I like. You do as you please. Hey, listen. Listen to me. - Hey. I will clump your hair! Hey, can you tell me what is she doing in my room? Out! What is wrong with you? You are crossing your limits. If you are so angry then why did you write the poem, the other day? 'The storm broke my Buri's,' 'glass doll.' 'All I am left with is a few broken pieces.' 'There flies the dust on the night, when dreams broke.' 'But her home broke, long before that,' 'in protest.' After that? 'My Buri's shadow now grows longer,' 'jumps over the terrace parapet to mix with the dust on the path.' 'Is she still afraid of crying,' 'as she still holds on to the broken doll?' 'All her sorrows are a secret.' 'The pain of breaking,' 'brings tears to her eyes.' 'Does she still looks for the broken doll,' 'on her own?' Give her our burnt tea. And not the tea from your wretched company. Teentala. What do you mean? First, I thought your name is incorrect. When I checked on Facebook, I recognised you. Then I did a bit of online digging on Google. That's it. Such a huge tea company. Managing Director. Would you like to have some tea? No. Thanks. So, the other day, why did you mix up the story at the last phase? I am sure there are many such characters in you. I just have one, that is Antara. Whatever story I think of, it always revolves around her. Who told you that I have other characters? No. I just thought. So, for how long have you been doing this?
