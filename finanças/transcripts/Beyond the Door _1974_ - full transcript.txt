To be here with me, that mad man blindly followed me step by step. He even took time to change into a stiff suit. Where are you going? Before that mad man create any trouble, I'd better do something to usurp him. Anyway, it's me he's after. Maniac! I say, maniac ahjussi! Do you know where this is? How dare you come? Get out! Don't do this here. Let's go out first. Let's go out and talk. Alright? Let's go. There are limits to jokes, you know. You're the director of this gallery, If you're not thinking about resigning, you'd better get changed right away. This is not a joke, not on a day like this. And who on earth is that clown? What on earth are you thinking? She's the daughter of that revered painter. Daughter? Avoid dung because it's dirty not because I'm afraid of it. What if this mad man suddenly pulls down his pants? Fine. I'll back off for now, I'll cajole him then I'll chase him off. Fine. Let's go on a date tomorrow, I'll see you. So don't behave like you did just now, becoming agitated all of a sudden. Relax! Calm your agitated self, Relax! Great! Good. Very good! You're doing well now. So let's just..... Go out for a bit, shall we? Just the two of us, please? See how much he's been longing for this, he's leading the way out himself. You're dead. You underestimated Son Young In. Who are you? Take it off. What? Don't act shy. Just take off your pants! What? What on earth are you up to? What are you trying to do? Why argue with me? Ah! Really! Maniac ahjussi. Stop making any designs on me. You should just go home. Since you're so keen to show it off, why don't you just go ahead? I haven't seen any maniac who's so particular about the process! Can't you shut up! There's a limit to someone's patience. You disappear before I call the police. What? Patience? You mean I'm not the one calling the police but you? Ha! This patient is making me crazy! (*?crazy' in Korean sounds like ?patient') What on earth is it you want? If you're not wanting to flash me, Then why follow me around the whole day? Didn't you hear me telling you to disappear? Disappear right now! Who should be the one telling whom to disappear? Whatever. I will disappear, so you should disappear too. Not just from this party, From now on, never show up anywhere around me. - Do you understand? - Representative Cha! Are you alright? What is your security team doing? This girl doesn't seem to be normal, Ask them to get her out quickly. I'm sorry. I don't know how we can make it up to you. What? I'm not normal? Ahjussi, you're really! Hey, unni, This man is a maniac. He's a psycho who just escaped from the hospital. Aren't you here to see the gallery director? Why aren't you in there but creating trouble here? Follow me now. Oh wait! Proof, I have proof. I have proof that this ahjussi is a maniac. Look at this. The maniac here in hospital gear... This patient here is this ahjussi. Look at this closely. I told you, it's this ahjussi. Hey, ahjussi. This patient here, isn't that you? Right? Am I correct? At my graduation earlier today, "This is your dad, Young In. This is your dad, punk!" Didn't you say that? - Representative! - Hey, maniac ahjussi! Are you running away cowardly? Hey! You maniac! Do you really know this guy? Yes, I want to watch that one too... I say...that... Let's take a picture. Shall we? Excuse me. Do you know that artistic theatre or something...? Nam Young! Hello. May I ask which movie you'd like to watch? Just any one will do. What? Then let me get you the movie which is about to start right away. And get me the ticket for the midnight show too. Yes, which midnight movie do you want? Just the one which lasts the longest, that'll do. Yes. That'll be $12. No, you can't show her the painting. When she sees the painting, if it were you, would you produce the contract just like that? She didn't even know that her father was a painter. She thought he went senile and just painted it anyway. That's why you must keep a hold on her, And assure her that we won't benefit from any of it. As you said it yourself, If painter Son intended for the painting to be hidden away, And if we want to find it, The only way, is to start with that child. And so? I'd like to continue monitoring her. Until when will you be monitoring her? Till I win her heart. The contract will be up on April 15. Before then, you have to find the painting no matter what. That is our painting. It'll be a hit in New York and we have yet to benefit from it. And now the painter is dead. It's all up to us now. The appreciation of the painting is not just peanuts! He's dead. It's not too late to pay respects first before counting the benefits, right? The funeral expenses, subsidy, I've given more than enough. I've paid all my respect already. What? Representative Cha? So you're such an impressive maniac! Just you wait and see. Today, I will shed your mask for all to see. Oh yes, who was that strange girl earlier? Ah! She must have mistaken you for someone else. She's not strange actually. Although I don't know the real reason behind it, Our gallery director invited her here. Please excuse me. Feel free to look around. See! Isn't he a maniac? And I caught you right in the act! And who is this? Isn't this the miraculously-resurrected Representative Cha? Long time no see. I heard you were in an accident. Chairman Kim was practically dancing around. If he knew you're standing right here, so strong and healthy, that old man's blood pressure is bound to shoot up. Chairman Choi, your pressure doesn't seem normal right now too, Please contain your expressions. It makes me feel bad for you. I thought you were strong only in your abilities, Your luck seems to be God-given too. Just back from the gates of hell, And already you've made $5.1m in 14 days. Not only were you not handcuffed, with just a fine and you're off the hook. Since you're an orphan, it can't be due to good ancestors. Orphans have strong survival instincts. This is just my flippant talk, so please don't take it to heart, Representative Cha. Well then, see you again. I think I overdid it. Please help yourself. I'll upload this UCC* onto the web. (*user created content) Title: ?The Obsession of the Maniac Ahjussi in Our School' Or ?The Friendly Mr. Maniac' Oh dear! What'll I do? Ah! This...this... Well... Oh dear! What should I do? Where is it? Since you called me here, you should have something to say. This is not some punishment, is it? Oh! I think I'm getting piles already. I've called for the spirit not the man. Spirit! That's why I'm saying, Why did you ask me here? This spirit. Tomorrow, Cha Seung Hyo will be on strike. What strike? That means you won't be able to use Cha Seung Hyo's body. Why? Didn't you violate the agreement, mister? Why are you saying I violated the agreement? When did I... Let go! Let me go! I have to see my daughter! Let me go, you people! Give him 3ml tranquilizer. Yes, Doctor. I've got my shot already, I can go now, right? After this injection, You will fall asleep. Rest well. Rest well? Let go! You jerks! I'm not Cha Seung Hyo! I'm really not Cha Seung Hyo! Let me go now! It seems I did violate the rules. I even yelled at everyone. And said I was the father. That I wasn't Cha Seung Hyo. Those who make promises easily, forget them easily too. Thomas' Law. I won't do that again. Let me off just this once, Ok? I say, mister, No, your honor, Only just 3 hours a day. Yet now you want to take a precious one day from me! Yesterday, I had trouble getting in, and I didn't get to stay for long. Not much luck on my first day! 3 hours a day, I don't care how you use it. But you're Cha Seung Hyo, remember that. Yes, I'll remember that for sure. But I say, That fella, Cha Seung Hyo, just what kind of guy is he? And why do you ask me that? I told you, you're Cha Seung Hyo. I must be sick. Sitting there and eating all that. Am I possessed by a spirit? Ah! I'm sick of all the tears already. Can't I control it? 1 pig. 2 pigs. 3 pigs. 6 pigs. 7 pigs. 8 pigs. 9 pigs. 10 pigs. 11 pigs. 12 pigs. - Young Ae! - 13 pigs. 13 pigs. You stupid. I say, Son Il Gun. Yes, Young Ae. Can you please leave my mind while I count to 100? Let me breathe a little. I have to live on. I think later on...later on... I'll think about you. 1 dalmatian. 2 dalmatians. Thirty... Three. Thirty-three, Young Ae. Oh! Three! Bingo! Bingo! That's right! Well done! Go on counting. Try getting to a hundred this time. If you go on like this, you can count all twelve animals of the zodiac! 34 tigers. 35 tigers. 36 tigers. 37 tigers... Young Ae! Keep well! Ah yes! It's really good. I like it. It's eye-opening. I wonder who'll get it. Yes. I took a look around, it's not bad. This is a very, very beautiful evening. You can hear my trembling voice, right? I'm so nervous. Well then, right now let's unveil for the very first time, An unknown painter whose work has taken the American market by storm. The work of painter Son Il Gun, let's view it now. This painting was done by Son Il Gun in 1999, "The Sight of Paris" Like many other artists it seems Son Il Gun also, dreamt of going to the capital City of Art - Paris. Using a larger than usual frame, He painted an old but grand corridor, Although it seems a little unrefined, it uses warm colors. Son Il Gun reproduced a splendid piece in his own original style. Are there any questions regarding this painting? Son Il Gun's "The Sight of Paris", where did this painting come from? With much difficulty, we got it from a collector we know rather well. Has any of his other paintings been shown? We're preparing to show his other works in the near future. [Where are you? I've something to show you. Can you come to level 2?] My camera. Please take your time. We'll just pack up a little later. You can pack up now. Since I'll be looking at it often in future. What? It's bought... By me. Did the gallery owner say she'll sell it? The auction sale...isn't it tomorrow? There are many competing for this painting, Congratulations! I didn't think you'd like this style of painting. Please send it to my house. Yes. Then please enjoy it some more now. If you even dare to lay a finger on my painting, I won't forgive you for it. Go away! Really! What's up with you? Are you crazy? Really! Young In! Young In! Who is it? The landlady! Open up. Someone's here to see the house. Hello. Oh it's so cold. Please come in. Please feel free to look around. Oh, you must be sad, right? Well, they say life changes all the time. Why did your father leave just like that? Have you eaten? You should eat well even at times like this. Otherwise, only you suffer when you fall ill. Now, you're the only one who can take care of yourself. Got that? Yes. But, so soon... I think so too. But this house, the debt interest for a day is not little, Those loan shark punks aren't waiting for too long more. Please feel free to look around. The house is a little old, The yard is big, the view is good and it's comfortable. With this amount of money, where else can you find a better place? Please look around. You've worked hard. I wonder what the spirits have been up to? Why don't they take away such rude people like him? You've worked hard. Your fly is open. Oh, Representative! You've been discharged so soon? Don't tell me you sneaked out again without permission? Secretary. Ms Yeo Ji Heon. Your annual salary is $45,000. With all that money, All you do is to apply lipstick in the office? Oh this jerk is too pushy! You and I, Maybe we just can't get along well. I can't take anymore of this. Find another job within this month. Oh, Representative! Representative, I will correct myself. I promise never to put on lipstick or anything in the office anymore. I can't be sacked for this. If others knew I got sacked because of a lipstick, what would they think? Representative, I graduated from a science and engineering university, I've never been abroad, not even once, Yet I'm well educated fluent in English, Japanese and Spanish. Representative, let me show you. (in Spanish) Representative, if you don't believe me, let me try this. Representative! Representative! This jerk! Devil! This fella is like a bastard. - Bear with it. - He's too cruel. I'll just throw eggs at you! Everyone says you deserve that! Oh! My lottery ticket! My lottery ticket! Hey! You jerk! Don't step on it. Such a young man, Are your eyes for decor only? This scoundrel. Are you hungry? Then eat when you have the money. Money... I have nothing so early in the morning. Disappear from me while I'm still being nice, Otherwise I'll send you to the police station. Well.... Aigoo! Aigoo! This fella is like a beggar. Aigoo! And he doesn't want to work hard to feed himself. He's just up to no good, stealing things. Aigoo! I have to take care of the home and stuff outside too! This is just too much! Aigoo! Such jerks! Aigoo! [Adopted to America in 1987. At 31, he's a success in the global M&A industry.] [Within a year, he acquired more that 100 companies.] Eat well and drink well and there's nothing left to do. Hey hubby, your wife's outside shivering to earn every single cent, Yet you're hiding in such a nice and warm place. And now you're into reading magazines leisurely. Is that right, my hubby? Can you just shut your trap? You shut yours first, old dog. What? Hit me. Hit me. Come on. Hit me. You think I dare not? Oh, a metal fist! A has-been champion. A fist fit only for hitting his wife and kids. Nothing else. The fist that destroyed the life of your one and only precious son, Who's just like you, locked up in jail for fighting. Now you're going to use this fist again? If it were me, I'd have broken it long ago. What are you going to do about the compensation? I am not going to send my son to prison again. If we can't borrow it, we must get it even by stealing. I think we should save the son and have you go to prison instead. Just get in and out quickly. Your life is wasted anyway whether in prison or not. Hurry up and move out. My son's medical fees cannot be delayed any longer. If you have nowhere else to go, just go and stay with your friends for the time being. Didn't you said that you're having trouble paying for meals and board? Hey Goo Goo, let's go to school together. As for your school fees... my parents and Duk's parents have agreed to pay half each. Hey, I can't attend school without you! The building of humanities college is too old, the toilets are horrible and there's no elevator. With such terrible conditions, I might as well not be accepted in the first place. How long do they intend to pay on my behalf? All four years' worth of fees? Well, that might not be the case... Hey, Duk has already found two part-time jobs. As for me, I'm willing to do anything as long as someone's willing to hire me. And when you get a part-time job too, and if the three of us work hard enough, your school fees will not be a problem. Don't give up, Young In. Hey. Delivery! You must be hungry, right? Feeling grateful, right? My style's totally cool, right?! Hey! What's up with you? This is so embarrassing! The part-time job you said you've found, is at your family's fried chicken shop? My father said he'd pay me double if I wear this chicken outfit. It feels pretty good! The kids love it too. It's broken... what a shame! Why aren't you snatching the food? Have you girls eaten already? Goo Goo, what's wrong with your expression? Did the two of you have a fight? Where are you going without eating the fried chicken? I'm going to get compensated. I'll eat it when I get back. Hey! Suk and Duk, you'd better watch it if you finish all the fried chicken! Ahjussi... Ahjussi! Aigoo, stop calling me Ahjussi! You're not the only one with something that has been broken. I can understand your anger and frustration, but I'll be in trouble if I let you through! Come back after you've made an appointment, that's my principle! Then, please make a call to Representative Cha and tell him that Son Young In from Seo Rin High School... No, tell him Son Young In, who bought him cold noodles at Samcheong noodle shop, is here. No, no, no... Just say that Son Young In, who saw him at the party last night, is here. Please give him a call first. - Perhaps he might even want to see me. - Samcheong noodle? You can find everything under the sun in this company, except this thing called "perhaps" Hurry up and leave. Go! Director! keep up the good work. Can we have a chat? [Letter of Resignation] I keep getting phone calls from the hospital director. That person seems to have escaped... seems to have left the hospital by himself again. I just met with the doctor-in-charge. Who is... she? Your daughter. Eh?! Please inform the Representation that a student named Son Young In is looking for him. Yes. Loving you turns me into a person of happiness When time comes to forget, it will be forgotten, {\a6}Loving you turns me into a person of happiness Bring me the list of employees who've not been performing over the past 2 years. And destroy Chairman Kim's evidence as soon as possible. That fellow seems to be knocking on doors everywhere! Alright. Representative, a student named Son Young In is here to see you. Let her in. Young In! Take a look at me! Why are you here?! How did you get here?! Have you eaten?! Why are you in such thin clothing, girl? What's your purpose here? Hey lad! Are you going to let the child stand around like this? Shouldn't you ask her to take a seat first?! And get them to bring some hot tea! You ill-mannered rascal! It's 57 minutes now. I'll let you have 5 minutes till 4:02 p.m. Get out of my room at 4:03 p.m. What, you rascal?! You think my child is a cuckoo bird?! A cuckoo that calls out for 5 minutes and disappears when the time is up?! Pay me back for this! The camera costs 420,000 won, plus damages, compensation for the grievances that I've suffered. It is 490,000 won altogether! You have to compensate too. Fine! Then let's lay everything on the table. That will make me feel better as well. How much is the laundry fees? Just deduct it from the 490,000 won. What's this about? You've dirtied his clothes, and this fellow destroyed my Young In's camera?! When? Where? Why?! Not compensation for laundry, but for my clothes. Don't you know that wine stain cannot be removed?! How much are the clothes? White shirt 580,000 won. Tie 260,000 won. Suit 3.2 million won. If you minus 490,000 won for the camera from the total of 4.04m won, the balance will be 3.55m won. That's the sum which you have to compensate me for. That... that's ridiculous... what sort of clothes... Stop lying! Whether it's true or not, my solicitor will let you know. Solicitor? 3.55 million won? What is this? You've just dug a deeper grave for yourself? Alright girl, what did daddy teach you?! Scoot! It's time to scoot! Son Young In from Seo Rin High School. I graduated yesterday. That's great, you're no longer a minor. If you don't compensate, I'll file a complaint against you for the destruction of property. That's a criminal charge. The sentence is 3 years imprisonment and a fine of 7m won in the Republic of Korea. Criminal charge?! Destruction of property?! Aigoo! You oily little tweep! You just wait. Wait till tomorrow, you rascal!! Tomorrow I will... let you have your just deserts, you rascal!! Why?! Because I am you, you rascal. So he attended her graduation, wept and claimed to be her father? Sobbed. Yes, he sobbed. Then he went to the Samcheong noodle shop and cheated a bowl of cold noodles from that high school student... Owed her a bowl of cold noodles. He's too much, isn't he? Yes. But why her...? And he even knows her name... Are you sure they really don't know each other? It's the first time they'd met. Both of them didn't know each other... but the representative remembers her subconsciously. Don't tell me she's his long-lost sister. Isn't he an orphan? Who knows? Let's wait and observe. 1,300 won for transaction fee? What work have you done?! This is all going too far. So hungry... [Student wanted for part-time work] We just hired someone, you should have come earlier. See you. That annoying ahjussi is here again... He's more timely than an alarm clock. What a total rip-off! He's here at this time every day? Yeah, 700 won please. There may be a piece of his memory here. What memory... He's here to free load on the expired kimbap. He does it every day. Please cancel the transaction. What am I doing...? Seriously... How are you? It's so cold today. Let me do it. It's very heavy. - That's why I'm saying to let me do it. - Don't touch it. You're not wearing gloves, just leave it to me. Put it down then. I said put it down. Give me your gloves. Do you even have to handle such chores personally? They're not careful enough. No, it's not that they're not careful, they're not loving enough. Be careful. They don't love their job and the pay is meager. I really don't understand why they chose to work here. I don't like perfectionists. So you're saying that you don't like me? Whatever... can I leave it here? Jae Ha, how much is your family fortune? 30 billion won? 50 billion won? My family fortune is in the minus. My parents are experts in owing credits. I grew up watching comedies on a TV set with a red repossession sticker on it. If I am also borne to a family like yours, I will also be as carefree as you are, have as much freedom, and learn to care of others like you do. Just like how jjajangmyun doesn't mean much to me, I would probably have said the same about perfectionists, and said it innocently. If I don't try my best to be a perfectionist, no one would show any respect to me. Have you forgotten already? You took notice of me because of that too. Sorry! I started whining and complaining again, didn't I? The misery of poverty and humiliation of having an inferiority complex... I don't like myself either. *Master Son's family called. (Note: Term of respect for an artist) Why? Asking where Representative Cha's office is. How can she not even recognize her own father's painting? The investigation has concluded. No matter how hard it is, this is a letter your dad left behind, so have a read. The investigation... reopen... Can't you reopen the investigation? My dad is not that kind of person. My dad is not one who will do that sort of thing and leave me like this, ahjussi. I know it. I can vouch for him. Ahjussi, you don't know my dad well. There must have been a mistake somewhere. Please re-investigate it. Please investigate it one more time. Almost a 100% of the deceased's family will deny a suicide. Even if a posthumous letter is discovered, they'll still deny it and question if an inquiry has been carefully made. It's something which is difficult for family members to accept. Has a death certificate been issued? Hurry up and get it done. If you don't do it soon, you might be liable for a late fee. I'm going now. When did you even prepare the ring? You told me, "It's not, it's not" and asked me to rest assure, but you're secretly intending to marry that woman? Haven't I already said that I don't like that woman? I said I don't like that woman, didn't I? Forever sneaking around behind my back. Forever breaking your promises. I really hate you. I hate you even more than when you were alive! Seriously... Dad, you really are a very irritating person! What is it? Why didn't you call before coming over? Let's make dinner. You like pork chop, don't you? I was worried that you're going to be by yourself, that's why I'm here. I'll leave if this is not a good time. Looks like I've picked the wrong timing. Make this for yourself later, understand? You have to eat it. I'm going. Please don't go. I don't want to eat alone. Especially pork chop... I don't want to eat that by myself. I'm already in such a pathetic state... Um... You'd better put this on. Young In, plate. Huh?! What's wrong? What did I do? Can I have a plate? The plate is here. Thank you. Young In, can you give the soup a stir? Alright. Are you mad at me? No. You seem angry. You're mad at me. What is it? Why are you angry? I said I'm not angry! Young In, it's getting cold! Hurry up and bring the knives. Um... About the knives... we only have these. Ahjussi, you can use the small knife. I'll eat with this big one. Thank you. Pork chop really has to be eaten with a fruit knife to bring out the flavor. Here. You're not feeling well in your throat? You've been doing that since just now. No, it's not like that. I know, girl. Eat up. Az Ham Bahut Kushe! What? Az Ham Bahut Kushe! What does that mean? I feel really, really happy today. It's a chant for summoning happiness. My dad said so. So your dad taught you the chant. Have you tidied up your father's belongings? No. I have to move anyway, so I'll tidy them up when the time comes. You're moving? Yes. Where to? That... I still... You can draw comics very well. Your photography skill is pretty good too. What's your dream? Comic artist. What a wonderful age! I asked you what your dream is, and you can give me an answer for it. How old are you, ahjussi? Ahjussi is 30 years old. I see... You don't look like it. Isn't your current job your dream job? Last year, ahjussi's father passed away. So I was dragged into the business out of my own free will. Ahjussi's dad passed away too? What was your dream, ahjussi? When ahjussi was young... I wanted to act in a musical. That's so cool! Are you saying that I'm cool, or it's cool to be in a musical? The ahjussi whose dream was to be in a musical. Thank you. Sing it for me. What is it, girl? Do it once! I have never been to a musical before. I'm really curious about what it's like. Just a little, just sing a little bit. Hey... well, here... How can I do it in a place like this? And ahjussi's vocal cord is... well... See how cold it is? No... I can't do it. It's freezing, I'm going in. Ahjussi! At this very moment At this very place I have yearned for this very moment A dream that belongs to me A wish that belongs to me May come true This is the place Today At this very moment At this very place No words can convey This very moment The days of waiting The days of hardship Are fading away Like smoke drifting far away At this very moment Like magic The chains that bind me are unleashed Now I am left with conviction Now I am left with victory At this very moment The road that belongs to me Even if you desert me and curse me I will still treasure it deep in my heart Praying in sincerity Praying in earnest God, please be with her What is it? Turn off the alarm, you ill-mannered rascal! You sick bastard! You pervert! You rascal...! You even have to find pets that are exactly like you. The owner is like this. You're like this, and the house is also like this. All the same! You're here. Good morning! Meeting at 9:02 a.m. Yes, sir. What? Letter of resignation? Wait till it's 9 o'clock, and you're dead! Come in. Ewha Women's University. Um... Representative. Hey, Cha Seung Hyo! Don't live like that! Do you think a person is like a bean sprout? You can just pick and throw away? What? You cannot get along with me? Hey, truthfully, I've been putting up with you all these time. Do you know that?! You think this is some military regiment? Or a school?! All those unreasonable demands about attire, hairstyle and hygiene... That's an illness! You are a patient! That's right. He even did this to my lips. Yes, I'm letting my hair down. What are you going to do about it?! Whichever girl who marries you is going to be down on her luck... Hey! Stop torturing other people, just get a nun to replace me. The enlightened ones may be able to put up with you, with the help of Buddha! Let me say this for the last time. You, the next time you see me, call me noona! You rude little tweep, how dare you even speak to me using the impolite terms! Hurry up and go for your meeting, it's already 9!! What is it? Going to give me a slap?! Cool down, noona! It's my fault! It's my unconditional fault, so let's just calm down. Calm down, Okay? About that letter of resignation, just cancel it. Cancel, Okay?! Representative... What representative? That damned representative! Like what you've said, we'll address each other as noona and dongsaeng. Calling you noona is good. Noona...! Even though I'm in the wrong, but you, Miss... No, my noona... Must also curb that bad temper of yours. Try finding another job out there. That's even more difficult than ascending to heaven! Even though it's a crap job, it's still a job nonetheless. How could you even... write your resignation letter?! Noona! Noona...! Oh my god... what should I do? That one is here again... Yes. The representative said that he has some urgent matter to attend to, so the meeting was cancelled. Yes. That's why I'm following in the car. Yes, I know. Don't worry too much. Alright then. Who was it...? Noona... Yes... Director Yoon rang and wanted us to take good care of you. Director Yoon. Driver master. Yes? Let's listen to the radio on the way. Yes. S...sorry. That previous one was better. Eh? Yes... Turn it up! Yes. Noona! This song is good. Yes... Fantastic! Fantastic! Noona... [Son Il Gun] Son Il Gun? Seems that you know him very well. What's your relationship with him? Rep...representative! This is someone else's house. You have to ring the doorbell! She's sleeping. That will wake her up, won't it? That girl... seriously...
