♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Anna ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ I happen to know that is really good cake... Because I made it myself. It's okay. Happy Birthday. Thank you. You're a goddamn liar. Oh, calm down. We decided it was going to be a casual thing. Casual? You told me you loved me. It's an expression, Bernice. Go to hell. Anna? Hello, Gerry. How did you get in? You invited me over for a drink and gave my shoulder a little squeeze. Remember? I've been thinking about things. How short life is. So, you decided to seize the day? Well, you only get so many. Why don't you put on some music? Set the mood? Great idea. You have taste. Funny. I didn't take you for much. Excuse me? Interesting. I would've gone for something a little more atmospheric. Best to drink this vintage neat. - Maybe later. - You sure? This is 80 years old. You can only get this in Scotland. Very impressive. Mmm. Hmm. These are cool. So delicate. Now, please be careful with that. Everything is transitory, Gerry. Just ask her. How did you die? Where did you go? What do you think? I have no idea what you're talking about. Where is her soul, Gerry? - Don't insult me, now. - I'm keeping this. Like hell you are. You come over to some lonely man's house and give him ideas, and then you act like a spoiled child. Now, give it back. Why don't you come and get it? Mmm. This is for Bernice. Ugh. 'Morning. Ugh. Hint of cherry. Oak. Tart finish. Hmm. Get your stuff, Robbie. What'd I do this time? Yep. You have to leave. All right. Whatever it is, just... I'm very sorry. Just please let me wake up, and then I'll help you clean. Okay? You really don't remember? Did I get some? You made out with my fiancé. Doug? Oh, man. I'm sorry. This isn't funny, Robbie. Okay, okay. I'm sorry, though, okay? Please, please. Just... It didn't mean anything. It was just a couple of guys having fun, all right? You can't crash here anymore. Look. Take a step back, all right? You know, I thought maybe, just maybe, you'd stick it through rehab eventually, but it... You didn't want to admit your own brother is nothing more than a worthless sack of shit. You make out with one dude. You know what? I was suffocating here. Now, I'm free, I'm really free, to go out there and find my destiny. So, hey. Thank you. Can I ask you a question? - I'm not giving you money. - I don't want your money. Where do we go when we die? You tell me. I have no idea. I need to find out... ...now. What's the rush? I think it's time for me to, you know, end it. So, do it, then. That's the thing. I'm fuckin' terrified of what comes next. Oh, I've done some shit. Okay. Um, I absolve you of all your sins. That's a nice gesture. Thanks. I just... I don't think you have the authority. - Nobody does. - No. Somebody does. I'm going to meet him, tonight. No. You're not. There's nothing. You just go out like a candle. That doesn't sound so bad. What are you doing tonight? None of your business. Sounds fun. Can I come? Up to you. Well... Um, I don't have anywhere else to go, so... So? Maybe I can just come in for a bit... ...and warm up? Maybe have a drink and I'll be on my way. I don't drink alcohol. Oh. Then, make tonight an exception. Hello? You there? Jesus. Come on. All right. It's officially super weird now. You didn't even tell me your name. Anna. Hi, Anna. Um, I'm Robbie. Hi, Robbie. So, how about that drink, huh? I might have something lying around. This scotch is 80 years old. You sure I can have some of this? Knock yourself out. Smoky. Like your eyes. I don't fuck humans. Right. Tilt your head back. What are you doing? Exploring your veins. Feels... feels good. Different blood has different qualities. Taste. Kick. I'm trying to guess what yours is like. Afraid? No. I'm a vampire. I kind of figured. I'm going to suck your blood and get high as fuck. Okay. I'm going to kill you. Get on with it, then. You're really not afraid? No. I'm ready. Okay, then. - Wait. - It's too late. No, no. Please. I just... I got one last thing I need. That shit is expensive. Yeah, it is. It's cost me everything. I vow not to have another drink as long as I live. Okay. Now I'm ready. Is it going to hurt? You might feel a little pinch. That's it? It's going to hurt quite a bit. Make it quick, then. What are you waiting for? Most people don't go so easily. They scream. They cry. They fight. I never understood it. I mean, no matter what, it's going to happen somehow, someday. Now or later, what's the difference? Good night. Can I sleep here? Gus. What do you think you're doing here? I'm going to start over. Listen. I know I made a lot of mistakes, all right? I'm sorry. But things are going to be completely different now, okay? What do you want, Robbie? Gus, I just want to make amends, okay? You're not getting your job back. No, no. You think this is about some dishwashing job? No. No, no. It's so much more than that. It's about me. It's about who I am. You know, I just want to be a good person, okay? I can't do anything for you. Go get yourself cleaned up. That's what I'm trying to tell you. But I need help. Please, Gus. We're going to be getting busy soon. Go home. Stop. Take it easy. Let me do my job. I don't even know how you're still here. The Grim Reaper is going to come for me when he wants. But if he thinks I'm going to lie around waiting for him, he's got another "think" coming. Can't run. Can't hide. Thank you. Most people just avoid the subject or treat me with pity. It's so exhausting. You seen Gerry today? No. Weird. Hello? Still here?

Sometimes the door would open, and a woman would come in and beat me with a stick. I think that was my mom. Tell us about your mom again, Anna. I have to go to work. Please, indulge me one more time. Why do you go to that job every day? It's beneath you. I can't live looting the dead. It's undignified. Besides, I like books. Oh, come on. Oh, shit! Shit. What happened? I spilled some pills. You take all of these? Yep. It's ridiculous. Oh, my God. How do you swallow that? I know. They sprung this one on me yesterday. It's supposed to help with the side effects. I don't know. Maybe it's not worth it. Hey. Hey! Hmm? Tell me again why you're doing this. For the laughs. Just have a drink. You could end it all right now. You think this is a joke? You watch me. Hey. I brought you something. Good morning. You sound different. I woke up this morning, and I looked at the pile of pills in the organizer and I thought, I don't want these. What? And so, I didn't take them, and you know what? I feel like a million bucks. - Don't you need those? - No, no. I don't believe the lies anymore. I'm going on faith. Faith and sheer willpower. I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. Go away! You okay? Robbie? Hey. Robbie! Shit. Hey. Come on. Come on. Robbie. Robbie? Robbie! Robbie, wake up! It's freezing. I thought you were dead. So did I. I think you saved my life. Clean up. You reek. Can I help you? You're Lara, the artist, right? Oh, somebody's heard of me? Of course I have. I brought some friends. They might want to buy something. Hi. Okay. Come in. Such balanced form. Please. We don't have to do art-school talk. Talk to me about where this came from. Sculpture is talking. - Just look at it. - She's right. Talking about art is like drawing legs on a snake. Well said. This is the one they'll remember you by. God. Who cares? I'll be dust. But your art will live forever. I'm not in this to create forever. Why do you do it? I do it to make the spirit flesh. Is that the kind of thing you want to hear? People will look at this after you're gone. They'll look at it and they'll remember you. They will miss you. I won't be able to do much about that. Deep, deep in the ground. So fearless. I wouldn't say so. Stop. Not this one. We are already here, Anna. People die all the time. Think about it. Someone, somewhere, is dying this very second. And this one. And this one. And this one. You're here to kill me? Hey. Sit beside me? Your work history has some gaps. What were you doing then? Uh, honestly, I don't really remember. Hmm. Well, don't really need any dishwashers at the moment. Well, that's perfect. I'm sick and tired of hiding in the back. I need to reinvent myself. I want to be a waiter, out front, interacting, serving people. I think I'd be really good at it. You don't even have bussing experience. Well, let's start there, then. Okay. Well, we'll call you. I don't have a phone. Mm-hmm. Shh. - Hey, stranger. - Holy shit. Vanessa. You look great. Thanks. How you been? Uh, unemployed. Fine. Perfect. You have time for a drink, then. Uh, I don't drink anymore. No way. No, it's true. Well, get in anyway. Uh, I don't think that's such a good idea. You know, Robbie, if you can't face your triggers, you haven't really beaten them yet. ♪ And your doubting mind ♪ ♪ Love's all I could devour you ♪ - Thanks. - Thank you. ♪ She'll wreck in kind ♪ Next time, dear, you only shake cocktails with juice. Old-fashioned you-just-stir. Yes. How's your water? Um, cold. Hmm. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be enjoying this so much in front of you. No problem. Don't worry. I thought about you a lot. Good God, why? I was a mess. Well, you were a hot mess. Looks aren't everything. No, but they're not nothing. Tell me a story. Oh, God. I'm sleeping on a vampire's couch. Like, an emotional vampire? Sure. Cute? Very. Sorry. But she's going to suck the life right out of you. I don't know yet. Well, if she ever gets to be too much, I have a guest bedroom. It's nice. I just got clean. Well, I'm not going to pour booze down your throat. But you will, though. Come on. I just want to take care of you, you know? At least for a little while. I'm not asking for help. I know, but sometimes things just fall from the sky. I just don't know if I'd do too well in a gilded cage, so... Okay. Well, the offer is open. Take my card. And you call me, day or night. I mean it. Bernice? Hi. Now I'm the one who looks like death. What happened? Oh, things are just being cut short a little sooner than we expected. How do you feel? I'm in agony. But it'll all be over soon. I mean, the agony ends, but so does everything else. And to top it all off, you're here. I used to have nightmares that I had a fatal disease, and I'd be so relieved when I woke up and knew it was just a dream. Could you wake me up, Anna? Wake up, Bernice. I wish I could offer you some hope, but I can't think of any. What if... What if what? Nothing. Why now? Oh, God. Well, you know, you barrelled in here and you jumped on me. Do I need a reason? Maybe I just felt like it. Come on. Look deep into your heart. Someone I work with is dying. She might already be gone. Sorry. Don't be sorry. So, you wanted to, uh, make the pain go away? Who is that? Nobody. Just ignore it. Ah. So, you do have friends. Let's see who these people are. Oh. Come on in. You idiot. You have no idea what they can do to you. You can protect me, right? I don't know if I can do that. Who's this? He has nothing to do with you. Don't tell me you fucked it. Anna. When was the last time you fed? You look like hell. I don't know. A few days. Okay. You need to feed, now. No. I think I'm going to lay off for a while. You can't lay off. Then I guess I'll have to kick altogether. Kick? You'll die. You've seen what happens. Maybe I'll become human again. Remember, they are cattle and not pets. Okay? Frolicking with the humans makes you one of them. An animal. Take a deep breath and let it pass. You're wrong, Boris. You haven't fed, and it's messing with your head. We need to do this, Anna. You'll thank us later. Robbie, run, and don't come back. - No. - No. I will be fine. - I'm not leaving you. - Listen to me. If you don't go, I will have to kill you myself. You don't want them to do it. Go! Great. Now, we have to go hunt. You can't change, Anna. I need to be alone. Leave. Well, that's it, then. You're just going to sit here by yourself and die? She'll come around. She just needs time. You know we will find him, right? Eventually. What's going on, Robbie? You're not going to understand. Try me. I just left her there. Oh, yeah. The bloodsucker. If you want, I can pour you one. That's a bad idea. I get it. You're scared. Maybe. You're scared that people are going to think that you're just a lousy drunk. But I'm not going to judge you. All I want is for you to be... ...who you really are. It's okay. Are you okay? 'Morning, Anna. What time is it? Who cares? Oh. Can you just forget her? Tell you what. Let's get away from here. Let's go to the cabin. She needs my help. She's not your responsibility. Where are your keys? You're not driving. Don't wait up for me, all right? Robbie, Robbie. Fine. I need a word with this bitch. Please stay in the car. Not on your life. Stay! Stay in the c... Hello? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Anna. This is what you've been so obsessed with? Just what kind of hold do you have on him, you junkie witch? If you don't get out of his head, I will beat your ass. - Okay? - Okay. No. Let me handle this. - Hold on. - Don't. Robbie... Okay. Come on. - No. - Open your mouth. Stop. - Stop. - Come on. Open your mouth. You have to let me finish this. Please. You can't be here. They will kill you. I'm not going to let you die here alone. Okay? Now, come on. Get up. Come on. Come on. Hey, baby. You okay? Robbie. He's in trouble. Tell us where they went. Come on. Robbie? I can't see. Anna? Anna? Anna, it's okay. It's okay. What are you doing here? Oh, my God. Run, Vanessa! Just stay calm. We're here to help. Where's Anna? She didn't make it. You're lying. Just... Can you just please get in the car and we'll take you home? Can you please get out of here? Please? Listen to me. You're under a spell. Will you go? Now! Please. You don't have to do this. You tell me where she is. I said she's dead! Okay. Robbie? Oh, my God. Watch closely. You did this. Don't. Robbie? Oh, my God. No. You see the mess he's made? Any ideas? Turn him. Anna bites Robbie. Robbie turns, and we all live happily ever after. I can live with that. It's a pretty good deal, man. I don't want it. I'm talking about immortality. Look at me. I'm a god. No, you're not. Living forever doesn't make you a god. It makes you less than human. Are you listening to this? I'm offering him the chance to live forever, and he's too stupid and weak to take it. I won't turn him. Fine. Then kill him. Or we will. This is all my fault. You're going to die because of me. I'm sorry. No. No, no. Don't be. You saved me. Okay? Anna? Anna? No. This can't be happening. How can she just be gone? Don't act like you care about her. I did care. Quite a bit. But it doesn't really matter now, does it? Just get on with it, then. If you're out to kill me, then kill me! Do it! Let's go, Nina. Are you sure you don't want to turn, honey? Travel the world?
