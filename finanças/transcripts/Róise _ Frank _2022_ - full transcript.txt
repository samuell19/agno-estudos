...moving forward he takes a shot... ..away it goes and on over the bar. Patrick Curran has it, brilliant by Curran. And really it's all over now. Hi. Frank O'Meara here. I can't take your call. Leave a message and I'll definitely get back to you. Trying to get possession now. Frank O'Meara happy on the sideline, the man who did all the work with them. Hi, Frank O'Meara here. I can't take your call. Leave a message and I'll definitely get back to you. ..and I'll definitely get back to you. How's your mother? Good. Fine. Blood pressure is normal. Well... I'm stressed. Do you want to see a psychiatrist? The old doctor used to give me some stuff. And it did work, I have to say. The Prozac was very good. Thank you. -How're things? -Fine. How's your mother? Fine. How many people are waiting? Four. A couple for check-ups. Look, there's poor Mrs. O'Meara again. Morning Róise, how are you? Morning, Anna. I have fresh mackerel today. I won't bother. It's a nice morning for a walk, Róise. Go away! Go away! And breathe out. Myself and your mother were always very close. We're kindred spirits. I understand her. Your father was a special man. Liked by many. Take a deep breath in, and hold it. Blood pressure is normal. Lungs are healthy. We'll do some blood tests and that's it. I had blood tests done a while ago and everything was fine. Alright. Alan, I'd like you to know, there was no romance between me and your mother while your father was alive. But things are different now. And would you mind... if myself and your mother developed a closer relationship? That's my mother's decision to make. Of course. But I'd appreciate your blessing. I don't think my father would really approve. But don't you think he'd be happy if your mother... He wouldn't be happy if my mother went out with a next door neighbour, somebody he knew. If you have no other questions about your health, Donncha, I have other patients waiting. The young boy from Waterford feels the pressure as he goes for a point. He sends the ball soaring. What kind of game is this? Why won't you go away? Hey, get out! Róise, don't let him in. Sorry, Anna. He's been following me around. Out you go! Come on, now. Don't be getting in people's way. Thanks, Róise. My unexpected saviour. I don't get on too well with dogs. Great to see you. I wouldn't have thought you were a dog person, Róise. I suppose they're good company. Oh, he's not mine. He turned up at my house out of the blue. He's been following me around ever since. You could ring Animal Welfare in Waterford. They'd take him off your hands. Ah, he's doing no harm. Stop, don't... You're not allowed in there. Get down... down! That's Frank's chair. Get down. Down! No one sits in that chair anymore. You! How did you find that? That's enough. You shouldn't be here. Get out! How did you find out about this place? Where have you come from? Can I get a steak, please? Of course. Too big? Will I trim some of the fat off? Don't bother. It's fine as it is. Do you know what I think about a lot? When we went to Limerick, to get a lawnmower. Why would I remember that? There was nothing special about it as a journey. We went there, we got the lawnmower and we drove back. Frank kept saying, 'We won't know ourselves when we have this new lawnmower.' Just to annoy me. I try to remember other stuff. More important stuff than that. But I keep coming back to that journey home from Limerick. Will I bring her to the crèche this morning? There's no need. My first appointment isn't until 10. You go ahead, or you'll be late. Bye bye, Mammy. See you later. Why don't we call in to see Granny? See how she is this morning. Up you come. What the hell...? Get the hell out! Out...out... Stop it! Leave him alone. -Christ, Mam! -Where is the dog? Great news, Emer. Your granny's gone mad. Did anyone see a dog run out of my house? No, Mrs. O'Meara, I didn't. Mrs. O'Meara... Look at her, she's crazy. Oh, Mother of God. Did either of you see a brown dog running by here? -I didn't. -I did. -Are you serious? -I am. -And you never said anything. -I saw a dog, Hugh. I didn't have to share that with everyone. -So you saw a brown dog? -I did. He was heading towards the church. Wait... Mam, wait! Everything all right, Alan? Yes. Everything's fine. Thank you. What's going on? Róise O'Meara is running around half-dressed. FRANK O'MEARA BELOVED HUSBAND AND FATHER Alan, what was the last thing your dad said to me? -The last thing he said. -I know! Remember how he was. Our story isn't over yet, my love. That's what he said to me in the hospital. He was delirious. He's done it, Alan. He's come back. I really believe that this is Frank. Listen to me, Alan! He arrived at my house, out of the blue. And I didn't understand it at first. Then he goes and sits in your dad's chair - his own chair really, he went straight to it. And Alan, he plays with your hurling ball! What hurling ball? He found it in your room. Mam, you know this is all nonsense. Listen to me, Alan. He went for a walk to the woods. The same walk myself and your dad did every day. Then he ran away from me and guess where I found him? Our picnic spot! Other people go there, maybe he goes there a lot with his owner, how do we know? Have you ever seen this dog before? And tell me, what would put it into his head to come here, to this grave? I can't answer that, Mam. Isn't your grand-daughter beautiful, Frank? I never thought you'd get to meet her. Okay, I'm going back to the car and you might follow me when you're ready. Do something, Frank. Show him that you're his father. The little boy from Sixth Class, with huge talent. He's going to show the whole world that he's an amazing hurler. Aren't you Mikey Lynch? Eh...yes. Well, Mikey, I'm not sure if you know my husband Frank is mad about hurling. I do, people are always talking about him. And would you believe that this dog is mad about hurling? Would you mind if he played with you? Fine by me. Don't overdo it now. I'll make breakfast. What's his name? Frank. Again? Okay, Frank. Will he score? What a legend! I like your dog. He's not my dog. Hey, Mikey. Is that dog teaching you hurling? Breakfast, Frank! We must give Anthony O'Brien a call to trim the hedge. It's not your fault. What else would you do? We have to remember that you're a dog now. So the dog is living with you? Alan! Frank only wants to get to know you again. Don't call him Frank. Listen, you're clever, but there are certain things in this life that you don't understand. Okay, Mam, we should visit the vet then. Why? There's nothing wrong with him. Every dog has to be microchipped. I don't think Frank will have a microchip. It would be very strange if he doesn't. And if he does have one, we'll contact the owner and we'll find out what his real name is. That's a fine looking dog. -What's his name? -He doesn't have a name. He's a stray. Fine looking stray. We're here to find out if he has a microchip. He won't have one. Aren't you Frank O'Meara's widow? I am. He'll always be remembered as a great hurling man. Is that your son? She'll be alright again in a week I'd say. It's not too bad. I'm in no rush. Would you like to go ahead of me, Mrs. O'Meara? Yes, thanks very much. What's the problem with this fine fellow? He's a stray. We want to get him back to his owner. His name is Frank. Frank? That's a nice name. Good teeth. He's been well taken care of. Yes, he has. So then he must have an owner. Okay, we'll scan him to see what the microchip says. He doesn't have a microchip, does he? He doesn't seem to have. That doesn't mean anything, does it? It's a legal requirement. He's about two years old. He should have one. How can we find the owner? I could put him on Facebook, to see if anyone is looking for him. We could keep him here. We can't leave him here. Look at him, Mam. He's perfectly happy here. Settle down now. Frank, don't be making a scene. You won't be left here. Absolutely no way. Do you know what happens to us when we die? -I do. -No, you don't. Lights out, game over, life goes on without you. We don't come back as fish, or as chickens, or as someone else. Or as mutts! Do you have a cable? You know me and your dad's song, don't you? Mam, don't put it on, please. I haven't played this since he died. Don't play it. You don't know what happens to us after we die, Alan. Nobody does. I heard she named the dog after your father. Is that true? It is. -Good morning, Kate. -Hello, you. I hope you're not causing trouble? We won't let him escape again. I heard Róise was up at the grave. I heard your mother got a new pet. And I hear she buys steaks for the dog? Can I have two steaks, please, Anna. He loves steaks. Who doesn't like steak? Come back to me if you feel dizzy. Thank you, Doctor. How's your mother, by the way? I heard she was out running the other morning. We could give her Risperidone. What's that? An antipsychotic. That's a terrible idea. And I'm her son, so it would be against the law. Sounds to me like that dog is cheering her up. And do you think that dog is your father-in-law? Well, I haven't met him yet. Then you're the only one around here who hasn't. Hey! Jack told me that you were hurling with some dog? I wouldn't say that exactly. You were too. We all saw you from the bus. Oh...yes. Some dog was running after the ball. So the dog wasn't playing? No! Tell him, Mikey. Well, I don't know. It's not my dog. Hey you...Conor, Jack, hurry up. We're coming to see that dog tomorrow morning before school. Be there! Would you like to go and see her? Hello, Garda. I know what you're going to say. Do you now? He should be wearing a seat belt. -No. That's not a proper animal restraint and the dog shouldn't be in the front seat. Frank. His name is Frank. Okay, well, Frank needs a proper harness to be able to travel in the back seat. Either that, or he travels in the boot. Fine. I'll get him a harness. Thanks for the advice. It wasn't advice. It was an order. You'll have to put him in the boot, now. The boot is full. And filthy. He's a dog. He'll be fine. He wouldn't get on well in the boot. I'll put him in the back seat. Frank, will you hop back, please? Listen here, I'm telling you to put him in the boot. I can't. He's my husband. He died just two years and two weeks ago. His sudden death devastated us. I'm sorry to hear that, but, if he has come back as a dog, he has to obey the rules. I won't be able to drive with Frank in the boot. Look, there's a pet shop on the ring road. Go straight there now and get a harness for... Frank. I'll get it immediately. Thank you. And drive slowly. I'm sorry I haven't been here for a while, Monica. I stay at home mostly. What breed is he? I don't know. He's a mix, I think. There's a bit of a lurcher in him. Yeah, you might be right. Good lad. Good dog. His name is Frank. I had a son and his name was Frank. I know, Monica. I married him on the 8th September, 1981. Róise? I like this dog. There's a bit of a lurcher in him. Letter to a consultant in Cork. The fourth this year, well remembered. They used to be called hypochondriacs. Now we call them 'the worried well'. What's that? Daddy should be a choo choo driver? A great idea! Daddy would love to be a choo choo driver. It would be way better than this. Alright so. Let's see about this dog. -What's his name? -Frank. Let's see what Frank can do. Waste of time. I got up this early to see that stupid dog. Give me back my ball. Thanks... Frank. Can you hit it this far, or do you have to carry it? Mikey, over here! Hey, over here, pass it. Mikey... Hello there, mate. Hello, Donncha. Mikey Lynch, the shy little kid from Waterford... who has a dog as a coach, and this is his moment under pressure. I heard Frank was back. And he's as crazy about hurling as ever. And off goes Frank the dog, the mighty hurling hound. Well done. He's a singular dog, no doubt about it. I better make us something to eat. Frank is always starving after training. Róise, now that Frank is back, and he's getting to do what he loves, what about getting back into your passion? I don't know, Donncha. The choir has started a lovely new piece. I'll send you the link now. I'll listen to it. I promise. We'd love to have you back. All of us. Hey, look at this video. Yeah, this video. Yes, yes, we're looking. Mikey Lynch, the shy little kid from Waterford, who has a dog as a coach, this is his moment under pressure. And off goes Frank the dog, the mighty hurling hound. Frank... what a silly name for a dog. Why don't you let the dog join your team? You might win something for a change! Hey, shut up. Okay, settle down. Phones back in the bags, please. Sir, we've found a new player for the team. And he's very skilful. -What's his name? -Frank. Look, Sir. Okay, Mikey... Is that you, Mikey? Why aren't you on the team? I'm not that good, Sir. He's too shy, Sir. He's the youngest in the class. Mikey, you've nothing to be shy about. I'll tell Sinéad that you'll be at training next Thursday. -Now, put the phone in the bag, Jack. -Okay, Sir. Come on, don't let the other player get it. We have to win this game. Well done! That's great, Conor. Come here. Welcome back, stranger. Sorry I'm late. They're here. They're kind of big, aren't they? We'll be killed! Get in! All of you. Now! Has anyone seen Mikey Lynch? No, Miss. Mark up... mark him! Well, Mikey. Did you forget your ball this morning? No, I didn't, Mrs. O'Meara. I wish Jack hadn't taken that stupid video. I know I wanted to be on the team, at least, I think I did. But I don't want to play a match. When is the match? I'm supposed to be there now. Well, when Frank was a man he used to get so nervous on the day of a match, that he could hardly eat. I think he'd love to go to a game again and to see you play. Okay, lads. In you go, quickly. Where were you? We're being slaughtered. -Come on, get changed. -Stop. If you're not here on time, you can't play. It was my fault. He was helping me in the garden and I didn't know he'd a match. He should have known himself, Róise. He's let his teammates down. You can be a sub. Maybe you'll get five minutes at the end of the game. Okay, off you go. You're not going to let him play, are you? They're a brutal bunch. He'll get hammered. I said I would. I just can't look at that miserable face much longer. Mikey, in you go. It's gone in! Get in! The first hurling final in a thousand years. Well done, Mikey. Great stuff, lads. Excellent! Here he comes. The best hurling coach in Ireland. They couldn't do it without you, Frank. Well done, lads. NO DOGS ALLOWED EXCEPT FRANK We're the team of the moment. We're not the underdogs anymore! Róise, if the other teams believe that the spirit of the greatest hurler this parish has ever seen, is present at every match. This is a big deal for us, Mrs. O'Meara. Everything has to be exactly the same. If possible. There is one thing. We've heard Frank is not microchipped. The rival teams could target him. You wouldn't want him to be stolen. There's your answer. Frank O'Meara, the coach who has taken them this far, will be delighted. Mam? A hand pass forward to Mikey Kearney... Mam? You look great, Frank. Hard to believe your owner hasn't been in touch yet. We'll put a chip in you so you won't go missing again. It feels wrong. It's the law, Róise. And I wouldn't be doing my job right if I didn't also recommend that you neuter him. -Castrate him? -Oh, it's not cruel. Dogs that aren't neutered... If you don't mind, I'll leave it to another day. It's a very standard procedure. Honestly... Mam and Dad married when they were twenty. She just can't accept that he's gone. If she were a patient, I'd listen to her, treat her and not leave her to find her own delusional solution to grief. How did you deal with it? -With... -With the grief? You miss him too, don't you? Róise, Tomás was up in O'Connells, picking up steaks. I told him to bring back plenty of bones. Frank will be delighted. Thank you, Anna. You've a heart of gold. Drugs, is it? None for you, I'm afraid. Bye... -Would you hold onto this for me, please. -Of course. Bones? Well, Anna gives me bones. But Frank doesn't touch them, of course. Of course. Could I interest you in a glass of wine? I don't know, Donncha. I wasn't sure if I could ask. What? I mentioned to your son that it would be nice to invite you for a neighbourly chat. But he gave me the impression that he didn't approve. To be honest, there are plenty of things that Alan doesn't approve of. I suppose sons are protective of their mothers. Well, a glass of wine never hurt anyone. I'm glad you came. Really glad. I'm glad too. I really enjoyed it. We should do it more often. Why not? My place, next time. It's lovely to be able to sit down with someone and talk about music or books. There are a lot of lonely people out there, aren't there? I'm sorry, Róise. I suppose you're thinking about poor Frank now. I'm not, Donncha. You're right. There are a lot of lonely people out there. But speaking of Frank, he's at home all by himself. I better be off. I'll walk you home. There's no need. Róise, I'll walk you home. Goodnight, Donncha. And thanks again. It was a lovely evening. Stop, Donncha. I'm just using some initiative here, Róise. What's a better cure for being lonely? You should go. Control that dog. Stop it, Frank. That's enough. Frank, please. Frank, stop. Now! Mrs. Devine? Your husband is fine. He's not my husband. My husband is at home. Sorry. I just assumed... He's my neighbour. He's separated. Well, he's fine, really. Can I see him? Of course. -How do you feel? -Hard to say. Thanks for being here. They're going to keep you in for a few days. They are, just to keep an eye on me. I'm not going to press charges, or anything like that. But there was nothing Pól could have done, Donncha. I meant, charges against you. Because of the dog. And welcome to Fraher Field, the Under 13 Provincial Final is on the programme today. St. Senan will be seeking their third win in a row. And it's the first chance in many years for St. Cárthach to compete for the title. Parking is free of charge. Let's get going. Everybody ready for a warm-up in five minutes. -Have you seen Frank today? -No, I haven't. Can we just play the match and forget about the dog? How do you think we made it this far? Saved it! The match! What's that? Somebody might be dying. Hi Mam, are you okay? You have to do me a favour. Do you remember this guy, Emer? A doggie? No! No, silly. It's not a doggie. It's your dead grandad. How are you, Grandad? Anyways, I heard you need to be at the match. Sorry for speeding, Officer. You certainly were. And that dog should be wearing a harness. You're right. And I should know that. But I don't normally ferry dogs around. Driving licence, please. I don't think I brought it with me. That dog isn't Frank, is it? Do you know Frank? I do indeed. And I know his wife too. Another goal for St. Senan, who now have 2 goals and 10 points. It's 8 points for St. Cárthach and we're close to half-time. Losing a final is nothing to be ashamed about. Remember, nobody expected us to make it this far. But to lose a game in this way, without even making an effort? That's not who we are. We have 30 minutes left to salvage our reputation. Can we do it? -Can we do it? -Yes, we can! -So let's get out there. -Let's go! Come on, Mikey. I don't know why you didn't make the team until this year. I'm not that good. Enough of that! You're the best player we have this year. Why didn't she bring him here? You don't need Frank the dog, Mikey. You did it all by yourself. No, I didn't. Five minutes. That's all I'm giving you. I want to see the real Mikey. Good start to the second half by St. Cárthach. The first point of the game for their player of the season, Mikey Lynch. A goal by Mikey Lynch! And St. Cárthach are back in the game now. Well done, Mikey. Go, St. Cárthach! That's it, lads. Keep it up. Just two minutes left and with that point, the two teams are level. And with that goal St. Cárthach take the lead! A great effort by St. Senan, but the day belongs to St. Cárthach! Would you like a cup of tea, or something? No, thank you. Now, so what's the nature of your complaint? -It's about some dog? -That's right. A vicious dog. To put it briefly, he attacked me. Did he bite you? He attacked me, and... .. he chased me. Look, Mr. Devine, there are cases where I can impound a dog, if it bites someone. I'd like you to do that. There is a chance the dog will be put down. I was hit by a car. Was the dog driving the car? You'd only be happy if the dog attacked me, is that it? Is he a dangerous dog? Let's just say the owner doesn't have a dog licence. You could impound it on those grounds. Do I look like a dog warden? -Can Frank come out? -Isn't he already out? -You haven't seen him? -No, I haven't. -You'll have to go to school, Mikey. -No, I won't. I'll help you find Frank. He's gone off on a walk by himself. Don't worry. He'll definitely be here tomorrow morning to see you. Go to school, Mikey. DOG POUND He was running wild around the area. And you don't know who owns him? He's a stray, a vicious one. I see, that's not a good sign. It means he was badly treated. What happened to him? I gave him a sleeping pill. Like I told you, he's vicious. Yeah, but you shouldn't just drug a dog like that. A stray, didn't I tell you? He's a fine looking dog for a stray. Will he be put down? Well, if he's that vicious, I don't suppose we'll have any choice. Okay, are you ready? Move in closer together. That's it, great stuff. One... two... three. Great stuff altogether. You've woken up, pal. What's up? Finding life a little tedious in here? This might cheer you up. Pretty good. You don't look too vicious to me, pal. Is there a dark side to you? Are you okay? I'm fine. He's only been missing for two days. Why did he leave me again? He might have had his own reasons. We don't know why he came back, do we? He came back, because he said he would. Let's go and look for him. I've looked everywhere. We'll look again. Have you found Frank yet? We're off out to look for him again. -Where? -I don't know. Where will we go, Alan? The dog pound. Do you think he's in the dog pound? If he isn't claimed, he'll be put down. Mikey! Go to school and leave it to us... I'm going with you. To get Frank. I think you might have my dog here, by accident. A dog called Frank. He isn't microchipped, but he's very special. I'm sure he's a very special dog, like a lot of them here. The dog is her husband, reincarnated. He's the best dog there ever was. That sounds fairly special, all right. What did this dog-husband look like? Absolutely gorgeous. He was a mix of a lurcher and a terrier maybe. Two years old or so. He's an amazing hurler. I remember him. A lovely, big, well-behaved dog, he was. He was...? He has a new home now. He can't have a new home. He has an old home. I'm sorry, but he wasn't microchipped. How can you prove he's yours if he's not microchipped? Now he's registered with another owner. Tell us where he is so we can take him home. I can't tell you that, it's private information. I didn't realise he was your husband. Hello? Hi... Greg. From the Dog Pound? Yes, I remember you. I'm Alan. Greg brought us here because you have my mother's dog. But don't worry, we've brought a fine replacement. I don't understand. How did this happen? He was stolen from me. You told me he was a stray. Well, he wasn't microchipped. Frank doesn't need a microchip. He's this lady's husband, this man's father, and this child's grandad. He's also my hurling coach. And we really want him back. He's a very special dog. Okay. You better come in then. Without him, we wouldn't have won the final. Why did you choose this particular dog? We didn't choose him. My daughter says he chose us. Somebody told me that dogs are a great way to help children deal with things. My husband died recently. We wouldn't like to keep someone else's dog. Let's introduce you to Sally. Her dad loved gardening. His name is Sparky. Do you like him? I do. He's the nicest dog I've ever seen. Hey, Frank, we were worried about you. His name is Sparky. Are you going to leave Frank here? This is a sliotar. A ball. Do you understand? This dog knows nothing about hurling. You'll have to teach him.
