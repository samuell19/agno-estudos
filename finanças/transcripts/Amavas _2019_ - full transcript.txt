And your grief I like being myself. You are my present Future. To join? Will you marry me? More than breathing. More than breathing. You need I was just incompatible. You perfected it. More than breathing. You wanted I was just incompatible. You perfected it. My mind... Your Pneumatics... Inside, the only one in their own heart. My mind... Your Pneumatics... Inside, the only one in their own heart. More than breathing. You wanted I was just incompatible. You've completed it. My mind... Your Puma... In one's own bedroom. My mind... Your Puma... Inside, the only one in their own heart. My eyes... Tell me... Your heartbeat... It belongs to me... My eyes... Tell me... Your heartbeat... It belongs to me... In the life of the questions. You want to fill in the color. Do not do anything with your lips. Forget questions. In the life of the questions. You want to fill in the color. No leverage through your lips. Forget questions. My mind... Your heartbeat... Inside, the only one in their own heart. My mind... Your heartbeat... There's only one snooker in my heart. Would you suggest him marry? Then why the hell are you with me? Why are not you with him? Because he left me why? He said no? Or did you stop dating? Before taking hold of the hand. Destiny we separated. Magic I've snatched them from me forever. That night. This house. Out. He fell off the balcony. He was on this. I did not have bedding with me. She. Dead. So since that day. I never had a walk in this house. And that's the room. That room is not by any of you. He was hiding from me. I'm sorry, Ahana. I could have just told you all this. But this is the truth in my life. I want to forget. This is Mayagui's story. And you're talking about that ghost. That's Shivani. Dr Shiwani Roy. My psychiatrist. Ahana. Karan. Karan. Karan. God damn it. What happened? What happened? Maya Maya Maya. Is she ok, Doctor? There's nothing to worry about. It looks like a bad thing. Can I go with him tomorrow to London? No, I do not approve of it She's not fit enough to travel I'll check in two days. Two days. Yes. Thank you, Doctor - Yes. Ma'am. Who's to meet Sarny Maharaja? A madman is here. Much to do with Maya's death. He was not able to save him She was very honored with the mistake. He was very impressed by that pressure. So I got a lot of bad dreams. Anyone who does that strange sensation Everything is waiting for everything. It's always around her Just like somebody else. But. Daily minds with medication She was very good. But then, I brought him back here. All his problems started again. Right? Siva I mean, Karan's feelings are not the same. It's true... then. That's it... I also saw the spirit of the Maya. - What? - I also saw him. That's what happened. You think you're crazy. You know Ahana. Medicine does not accept such talks. But each coin has both sides. If there is a God, There is evil. If you have a good saying, There's got to be bad. If there is light, There's dark too. I know from a doctor's mouth It is strange to ask for things. But the truth is always for us It just does not look like that. What is Disease? No, I do not. I believe in biology and just as much. Believe in the strange powers. That means you trust me. I believe in God. So I believe in ghosts. You I do not believe in God So I do not believe in ghosts either. Is it silly? God did not come before But I noticed. I do not know what to do Ally Shivani. To a soul that wants revenge. Or to come to an imperfect desire. She's very dangerous. To do the Maid for so long What's wrong with not doing damage? Because it's mentally strong. But this house, at the place where she died. His soul is very powerful. It's too dangerous. If Maya is back. He wants to take her with him It's coming. Get it to a limit We can go. He can be a lot worse. I will not let her Give me a hurt. I'm not giving anything to do. Did you hear Maya? Careen me I do not let you take him. You will never get remedies I will not let you win Maya Maya Maya. I know you're here. Maya. Why come after Karan? You made a big mistake. You left the carriers alone, right? Dear God! Karan. What happened to Ahana? Maya... and he's going to take her! Karan do not, I'm the sage's little sister. Rūhī. How did you get in this house? I was not alone by myself. I got help. Gōṭi. I helped with this. Because I wanted justice to him I've been watching this house long ago But Karan never came. And he came here to take care of this I asked him all about him. Gaulty understood my pain I was ready to help. From then on. We both scared you. I had the doll you found in the room. I wanted you to send it to me. I had to know that bottle Give me Maya. Where did you come from? You were tempted to do something why? Because I want revenge on my sister's death. Maya's death is not murder an accident. Karan did not kill him. He did not kill her! He likes you like the rest of you. All evidence of Maya's death. To act against. The family of the Ajmer saved her. Money and power are people's always Misuse. But I know the truth I'm the one I've always judged I remember today that night. Where did you come from? You all fooled foolishly It's going to be planned. And. You are my best brother. Nobody says anything. The plan first Then decide. Rehine, really, make me From London to come amazed. No one in his house. Amazingly alone. Birthdays. So now what? Or are you going to go here or go? Act really quick I'll handle it here. You're good. Karan. Um... What happened? I guess.. There's someone out there. We were waiting for the longest. Here, right now Maya Maya. He lied to me. Not only you He lied to all. He lied to all. He said a lot easier. When she is unconscious. A third has come up with the illusion of killing. But the truth is. That there was a third person in the police station I did not receive a testimony. There was no third person. And the third of three is why kill magic? Maya never hurt anyone. Nobody has thought bad. So tell me. Do not kill Magick. Who has to be. I know Samir Samir - Yes. Sameer behaved unnecessarily. After that, Samir after that I did not try to contact. I'm sure that Maya should have been killed Maya saw the third person. He wants to be a seeder. It's not possible. This was not the murder of Sameer I'm telling you, Sivani. Sameer was very angry. This could have been revenge on the Sameer. That's what she wants to be. No Ahana... that. It can not be Samir. Why are you protecting him? Why Saemir Can not Be? I am, Because Samir was dead tonight. Sameer acted unnecessarily with me at night. I got him out of the house. I have no relationship with him I did not want to keep it. But. Now let me know who. Karan. Karan. Stop Samir. The devil I'll kill you. You do not know who I am. You're going to be killed. Holy shit! I killed her. I killed her Maya Maya does not mind. It's okay I've put him to death. Not anything. Sameer has no family or relatives He's an orphan. Everyone knows that he is tomorrow That he was in Germany. We'll put her body on it Nobody knows anything. And then we put her body in here. This is the whole story of Karen Alamera. Rūhi. I did not kill magic. I loved him very much. I promised him. That I will not let her go. I could not save him. But you still feel that way I'm your fault. Then I'm sorry. Now listen and listen Nothing is left. We will return as soon as tomorrow morning. Karan. Is not that what's left? Is it all over? Things that happened... that's the past. It's over. But that's what... the present. Then be things to be the future. Want to finish it? My present... Only the future is Ahana. I lied to you. Hiding many things. After that, you can not even think of us... today. After I know the whole truth, My trust strengthened you. I totally live my whole life. You just have to pay with it. Before my answer, yes... It's still the same today. But you're asking me about this question I would like to ask. Will you marry me? What happened? What happened? I think we should leave here. This is not a man's business. You mean this house is really There is a soul. It's like real ghosts I'll check. Please. Please... let's get out of here. For years I was scared of my fears. For the first time today, I have gone before my fears It needs to face that. I need to do this. Rūhī. Ahana, you're left at Rihína I'll get him a water. But Shivani do not be scared. There is this blessing. This will not happen to me. Take care. Ahana. Karan. No... do not go... please... Please do not go Ahana... Help. Please. Karan. Karan. Rūhī. Rūhī. Holy shit. Let's go.

Leave. Leave him. This room is protected from the spells. He can not come here. We are safe here. What's Shivani doing? I do not understand anything. How's Samir coming back? Sameer has not returned yet. He's never gone Karen for eight years for the Samir's soul There's inside. And today. On the upcoming day, this place is back. She's very powerful. That's why he did it completely It's closed. You really understood Shivani. But it's too late. I'm going into the body Make mistakes. But do it. She really cares about love. Propose that marriage. A year... two do not mind. But marriage. With all your life, with one girl. Not at all. That's why I killed Maya. Karan. Aduragattada? I'm back. Innocently he cried. It's possible. Sameer Maya was killed. Listen, let's get out of this house You have to find a way, okay? You have done the job. He's not Kran He is Samir Ahana. No, the Samir inherited it. But do it yourself I love her I'm not leaving him. Please help me, Shivani. Holy shit. That body. Hey? Body. Samir's body is Ahana. A soul can not be inherited directly from a soul.
