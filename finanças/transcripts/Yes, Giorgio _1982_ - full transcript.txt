Arrivederci! Arrivederci! Si. Grazie. Si. Ha ha ha! No. No. Si. No. Si. No, no. Si, si. No. [Music playing] [Una furtiva lagrima playing on tape] [Singing along] [Turns off tape] [Turns on tape] [Giorgio singing una furtiva lagrima] [Mother superior] No! [Giorgio singing o sole mio] Oh, bravo! Fini, bravo, bravo, bravo! Si, giorgio. [Orchestra playing] [Man] How can I explain this to the council? Explain to me, Mr. Pollack, why an opera singer needs a full gym in his dressing room. Before every performance, signor fini likes a strenuous workout-- tones him up, gets rid of his tensions, relaxes him. We want him relaxed, Mr. Councilman. I know you're his manager and you got to look after him, but all this is over the top, isn't it? Not really. Mr. Mullane, it's important that we treat this man in a very special way. No, let me explain. Uh, Ted... Ted, Franz liszt once said that every theater is a lunatic asylum. Opera is the ward for incurables. I like that. Well, it's true. Well, now, Ted... Giorgio! Oh, giorgio! Giorgio, it's me-- Faye Kennedy. Remember? From last year. Wait until you see what I made you for this year. [Crowd making admiring noises] Ohh... Thank you, Faye. Tomorrow I will sing the Aria chelo e mar just for you. Excuse US, dear. They're waiting for you. I'm pleased to have you here in Boston. I'm councilman mullane. Councilman mullane! Giorgio, come sta? Bene, bene. Did you miss me? Only your cooking. Phone call for you. Do you want me to take it? No. I take it. Then we'll begin, o.K.? With la Donna e mobile. Orchestra? Orchestra. If it is not too much trouble for you ladies and gentlemen, would it be possible to resume at figure 14? The answer is no. It will always be no. [Speaking Italian] Giorgio. Henry, I never want talk to them again. Why they call me? Because they very much want you back, that's why. Do they think that what happen seven years ago did not happen? It did happen. Giorgio fini will never sing at the met again. That place has the malocchiofor me. That's foolish superstition. You just happened to be there on a night when everything went wrong. You've got to try again. Never. Forever. Giorgio! Listen very carefully. Ah, giorgio. La Donna e mobile? Set. [Orchestra playing introduction] [Singing la Donna e mobile] [Voice cracks] What happened? Giorgio, what's wrong? Get a doctor! This is Dr. Pamela Taylor. How do you do? [Hoarsely] No doctor. Is a nurse. You said he was from Italy. You failed to mention he was from the middle ages. Dr. Taylor is one of the leading throat specialists in new england. Please let her examine you. Her? Yes. No! I fix myself. That is the worst thing you could do. I'd get someone in here--fast. No, please! Don't go. Please don't leave. Don't leave. Don't go. He's frightened. He's not himself. Look, I'll try to find someone else. Is there a phone? Yes. Henry... Please, save your voice. Look, I want to talk to you, only I don't want you to talk to me. O.k.? Good. Giorgio... In my first year as a manager, I discovered an extraordinarily gifted tenor by the name of benvenuto nardino. Nardino? You've never heard of him, and there's a reason. Nardino was making his debut at the Vienna state opera, in rigoletto. During the first rehearsal, his voice failed him. Yes! Just as yours did. I called for the best throat doctor in Vienna, but when he arrived, nardino refused to see him. But why? Because, uh... He was German. "Only an Italian touches nardino," he said. After two hours of searching, I finally found an Italian physician in Vienna. We rushed back to the theater... Too late. His voice was gone. The great nardino never sang again. Never? Never. A tenor felled by his own pride. La dottoressa. La dottoressa. He'll see you now. I convinced him. [Dr. Taylor] Oh, how wonderful. Would someone please set up that lamp? I can examine your throat through your ear, but I guarantee it won't be as effective. Ahh... You're growling better. Open your mouth and stick out your tongue. There you go. Now, if you breathe through your mouth, you won't feel like gagging. [Coughing] Uh! Eee... Eeeh... [Cough] May I have a word with you--outside? What is it, doctor? Nothing. There's absolutely nothing wrong with him-- at least not physically. My guess is, he lost his voice because of what's known as conversion hysteria. It's psychosomatic, usually keyed traumatically. Did anything upset him today? The metropolitan opera called him. He had a disaster there seven years ago. He hasn't gotten over it. Bingo. We'll tell him. He has to think he's been helped, so I have to give him something and then cure it. A syndrome would be nice. How does the steinmetz syndrome sound to you? I like it. O.k. Everybody be really serious. Mr. Fini, there's only one way to handle this-- quickly and with total honesty. You have the steinmetz syndrome. Steinmetz syndrome? We caught it during its gestation period. Another hour or two, and it might have been too late. You can fix? You're not afraid of a shot, are you? No. A little lower. Lower. Aah! The voice is back. Maybe you should turn the other cheek. No. I sing for you. Let's go. He won't need another b-12 shot this year. [Beeping] I don't want to die. I got so much to live for. James, we're just taking your tonsils out. That's what's going to kill me. Why don't you admit it? You're scared. Shut up, Levi. You're going to be asleep the whole time. What if I ain't tired? You will be once they give you the shot. See, they hit you with this great big needle-- James, come back here! Hello, doctor. James is worried about getting a shot. A man afraid of a little shot? It ain't the shot. They're taking my tonsils out. Oh. I change places with you. Doctor, take out my tonsils, please. You crazy? No. It is you who are crazy, because tomorrow it is I who will have all the ice cream I want, and you will have nothing. What ice cream? If you get your tonsils out, you get all the ice cream you want. Get out of my bed, extra-large. If you're lying to me, I'm going to be all in your face, tons of fun. O.k. Let's get on with it. Somebody will be here in a few minutes. That was very fast thinking. I have much experience. Two children. Doctor, I have come here to thank you for the fantastic thing you have done. That was nothing. It was nothing? Was my voice. Why did you leave before you hear me sing? Did you come to thank me or to find out how anyone could leave without hearing you sing? I am not sure. At least you're honest. Excuse me, but I have to get ready to take out those tonsils. Wait, doctor. I want you to come tomorrow to hear me sing, and after, I take you for supper. That's very kind, but I can't. Now, I really have to go. [Giorgio] But I insist. You'll have to take no for an answer. Mr. Fini? Excuse me. I'm Dr. Stuart barmen. What a thrill this is. I'm going to see you tomorrow. Then, my friend, convince her she should do the same. She fix my throat and refuse to accept my invitation. Pamela, this is the greatest singer in the world. You mustgo. Opera puts me to sleep. Because you have never heard me sing. I challenge you to come. If you don't fall asleep, you must have supper with me. In the concert, I will sing an Aria just for you. Me and 150,000 other people. No, for you alone. The Aria is chelo e mar. That's my favorite. When I sing "vieni, o Donna. Vieni al bacio della vita--" "come, my beloved. Come to the kiss of life--" it will be just for you. ♪ Vieni♪ ♪ o Donna♪ [Off-key] ♪ vieni al bacio♪ ♪ della vita♪♪ [Orchestra tuning up] Oh, here he comes now. [Applause] He's singing this one especially for me. [Giorgio singing Italian opera] [Song ends] [Applause] Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! [Cheering] Oh! Please have a wonderful evening, compliments of the copley Plaza. Grazie, amico. Thank you very much. Have a good time. Good evening. Ah, signor fini, welcome. Please follow me. So? You did not fall asleep. You sang exquisitely, Mr. Fini. Please, Pamela-- giorgio. Giorgio. It is you who gives me the ispirazione to sing more beautifully than I have ever sung. Giorgio, take a look around this room. Is beautiful, no? Yes, but the entire staff is standing by to service our every need. Those musicians are playing just for US. And if you haven't noticed, we're the only people eating. Is good? Is unusual. They like to do this for me, and I hate to disappoint them. Pamela, what you see here, it is nothing. The fabulous singers-- they were gods. Have you heard of the famous prima Donna malibran? No. I probably slept through her performance, too. Not likely. Maria felicita Garcia malibran was the greatest soprano of her time. Composers write operas just for her. When she visit a city, her public carry her to her hotel, careful that her feet never touch the ground. Each night after the performance, again they carry her from the opera house, covered in furs, in a torchlight parade. Well, except for the furs and the torchlight parade, you and malibran are just about even. You're talking about another time and place. People don't live like that-- this. It's way out of proportion. Pamela, are you a communist? Of course not. Good. Have you ever dreamed to be a Princess? I didn't have to. I was born into a very happy, loving family, got to go to the best schools. Now I'm doing exactly what I wanted to do when I grew up. I'm a doctor, like my father. So in a way, I was a Princess, but it was real, not a dream. All I had was a dream. If it's not, I would still be fixing automobiles at my father's side in Italy. But the kiss of god is on my voice to make me what I am, like the kiss of god is in your soul to make you the best doctor. Ha ha ha! Don't laugh at me! Things don't always have to be the greatest, the grandest, the biggest, the best. Why you make everything that is so big so small? It's not small. It's just life-size. You have a very nice thing going for yourself. I suggest you continue right on through to dessert. This does come with dessert, doesn't it? Obviously you don't hear me, and I don't hear you. I am not apologizing for the way I am. I am hurt for you, for me, for what has not happened. Life never has to be life-size. Please take the doctor home. That won't be necessary. [People singing funiculi, funicula] ♪ Funiculi, funicula-a-a♪♪ [Hoarsely] George, if you wanted, you could even be a singer. I think about it. Remember what I told you yesterday? About the ice cream? Si. See what? See that. [Children ooh and ahh] Strawberry! Chocolate! Dr. Taylor. He insisted on stopping by on the way to the airport. We're going to San Francisco. That's very generous of him. Uh, somewhat. Actually, I think he really wanted to see you. Oh. Giorgio. [Boy] I want vanilla! [Man] Chocolate? Vanilla? Vanilla! Vanilla! Strawberry! Strawberry, strawberry. Chocolate. Strawberry. This is good! I did not want it end like that. I shouldn't have laughed. It was rude, and I'm sorry. Last night, I could not sleep until I know what to do about Pamela. Then, all at once, I know what I must do. A ticket to San Francisco? The plane leaves in 45 minutes. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's a very generous offer-- in fact, the nicest I've had all day-- but in case you've forgotten, you're a married man with two children. I love my wife and my family. We have a wonderful life together. But my private life is my own. Do me a favor, giorgio. Go to the airport, get on that plane, and fly out of my life forever. Do you think I do this for my own pleasure? I do this for your own good. Believe me, is for a fling, no? This, too, but more. Just leave me out of your fantasies. It is no fantasy. This ticket is real. I am real. Pamela... You are a thirsty plant. Fini can water you. I don't want to be watered on by fini. You are an audacious, arrogant, presumptuous Italian peacock's ass. Ciao. She seems to be crazy about you. Si.i know. [Intercom] Paging Dr. Duncan, Dr. Karen Duncan. I'll be with you in a minute. Oh! So I got carried away. You going to hold that against me forever? Yeah. Dr. Taylor, you have something against plastic surgeons? Know what the problem is, Doug? You're just too perfect. I like men with flaws. It gives me something to work with. I have some flaws. Shh! [Giorgio singing Italian opera] You bastard. [Music playing] Giorgio! Giorgio! Ladies and gentlemen, please join US as we toast the most gorgeous voice in the world.

Won't you come in? Pamela, what you have done to me is not the way to win my respect. What you have done to me-- putting me in this embarrassing position-- is not the way to win myrespect! I have done you a great honor. I introduced you to my best friends. As Henry's niece. The woman should never make the man look like he wear the skirt in front of his amici. Oh, isee. So I should always let you win? Si. Is that what your wife does? Of course. Is that what your bimbos do? Cosa vuol direbimbos? Your one-night stands. Your groupies. The other women you've brought here. I never bring any woman here. Look, giorgio, if I always have to lose the games we play, then you can get me a cab and then a plane. [Door closes] First, we play one more game. This, we both win. [Up-tempo music playing] Good. Good. Like this. Like this. [Whistles] Ha ha ha! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey...ah! Ha ha ha! [Cheering] Silenzio! Silenzio! [Speaking Italian] They will sing a song they sang together when they were children. [Singing Santa Lucia] [Whispering] This bow tie make me crazy. Help, please. Giorgio, are you o.K.? Is always like that the day of the performance. There. That's good. Thank you. You know, I cancalm you down. Oh, no. Not before the performance. Is bad luck. After is good luck. [Ring] Hello. The residence of giorgio fini. Oh, this is the maid. Yes, ma'am, Mrs. Fini. He's right here. Carla, si? Oh. Uh, Pamela... Have you got a minute? You care for a drink? No, thank you. Pamela, I'd like you to do something for me and for giorgio. The director of the metropolitan opera called this morning. Their new season starts next week, and they're opening with a spectacular new production of turandot. Leona Mitchell is playing the Princess. Now... This sounds as if I might have arranged it, but, as of two hours ago, they have no tenor, and they're begging giorgio to bail them out. It isone of his best roles. They need an answer before tomorrow morning. You want me to ask him? It's too easy for him to turn me down. I'm the one who's just here for a fling, remember? Who are you kidding? You're way past fling. I'd put you somewhere between affair and involvement. Pamela, if he doesn't play the met again, he'll never be whole. He's at his peak right now. He's singing better than I've ever heard him singing. He's full of life! He's full of you. No, Henry. I can't. [Giorgio] Pamela! Henry! [Spits] [Spits] [Spits] That was my first singing teacher. He told me to remain a mechanic. Then he asked me to fix his car. I'd better go. Good luck, giorgio. You must never say good luck. We say in bocca al Lupo. This mean, "in the mouth of the wolf." You see, if you expect disaster, maybe good luck come. O.k. In bocca al Lupo. [Speaking Italian] [Singing Donna non vidi mal] [Applause] Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! My friends, tonight fini cook. Hey!yay! Everybody come for supper. Yay! Yay! [Giorgio whistling] Oh, Pamela, we need more cheese. You have to grate the cheese now. Pamela, hurry! [Giorgio] Be here. We're starving out here. Oh, Henry, it is a science. [Humming] I wasn't going to do this. I've changed my mind. I want to talk to you. But the pasta! The metropolitan opera wants you to open the season with Leona Mitchell in turandot. The tenor quit, and they love you. Henry and I think you should do it. This is very important. What happened before won't happen again. If you don't do it now, you'll always regret it. [Bangs pot] Giorgio fini will never sing at the met again! Giorgio, this is not like you. You're acting like a coward. I am not a coward. That place has the evil eye for me. You don't even know what happened there. Then tell me what happened. The opera was la gioconda. Everything start fine. Then... In the third act, it happen. Alvise badoero just show me the dead body of my lover Laura, and he told me he poison her. I am furious! I try to draw my sword. It will not come out. Finally, I pull it free! [Clattering] I'm left holding just the top. The blade fly across the stage and wound Laura. Now Laura jump up from her deathbed, screaming, "I kill you, fini!" She grabs the dagger from the Duke and come at me with it. She force me back and back and back until I am in the balcony, where I stumble, and I fall over the rail into the grand canal. Finally, I come back up from the canal. The opera start again. I try to sing. The voice is gone. The audience laugh at me. Can you imagine anyone laugh at me? Ha ha ha! [Pamela laughing] Is funny? Ha ha ha. Maybe you think it is funny, too. Hmm. The salad needs something. Parmigiano? Perfect. A big ham is not complete without the eggs. Aah!aah! All right! [Screaming and banging] You know, you can't keep saying no. Pretty soon, they'll stop asking you. Who cares? You should! You're 44 years old. 42! Ooh! Giorgio cooks better when there's noise. They humiliate me at the met! They laugh at me, and I lost voice there, just like I did in Boston! Exactly! And there was nothing wrong with your voice in Boston. It's not true. You cure me. I did have steinmetz syndrome. There's no such thing as steinmetz syndrome. I cured your head, not your throat. No. Yes, giorgio. You were afraid. The fear caused you to lose your voice, that's all. There's nothing to be afraid of at the met. If you don't go back now, you'll never go back, and you'll never be complete. Pamela, you go with me? Of course. Then I go. Yippee! Ha ha ha! [Giorgio laughing] [Giorgio and Pamela laughing] Everything all right here? [Man] Now, why is this? You have to remember the steps, the rock steps, and you must not trip over them. Now, when Leona comes in, she has this long, long train. Now, Leona, dear, remember, you are the principessa, and you must think remote. Now stand here and put your arms up, so. Ping, pang, pong, if you'd be so kind to move here. Ah. Thank you. Leona, are you ready? Yes, maestro. Ah, brava, brava! That's high enough. Piano! [Piano playing] [Leona singing in Italian] [Singing in Italian] Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico! Giorgio! Ha ha ha ha! Giorgio! Giorgio! Ciao. Welcome home. Thank you, Leona. In 15 minutes, we start from the top with signor fini-- if he can compose himself. [Laughter] Pamela, if it were not for you, I would never stand here now. And Tuesday night, I shall sing just for you the most beautiful Aria in the opera-- nessun dorma. At the end of this Aria, I will sing vincero, vincero. Do you know what this mean? I shall conquer, I shall conquer. And I shall, Pamela. I shall. ♪ Vincero♪ ♪ vincero♪♪ Si, si,operator. Carla fini. Hurry. Si. Si, Carla. Giorgio. [Speaking Italian] Carla, giorgio fini ritorna al metropolitan! Tell her who talked you into it. Nessuno. No one? No, nessuno. No! No! Operator! Operator! Operatore! Pamela. Who, me? Nessuno?nobody? Pamela. Pamela, Carla wait seven year to hear this. This make her happy. Well, I'm happy I could make your wife happy. Pamela, tu sei gelosa. What does that mean? This mean you are jealous. Of course I am. I love you. No. Yes, I do. I love you. Please don't. You spoil everything! Spoil it? Giorgio, no. This will make it better. I'm not asking you to leave your wife. When you're here, I want you. That's fair, isn't it? No. No. You have broken your vow. You promise don't fall in love with me. You can't hold me to that promise. We have something very special. You have to admit that. No. Pamela. [Roaring] Yay!yay! [Maestro] Good! It works. Now, remember, this is a rehearsal. We have to pick up time, so please get into position. Hurry with the horses! What are you doing? Fast! No, no, no, no! Open the mouth! Artie, open the mouth! It's supposed to be open! [Henry] She got back to Boston safely, and, if you're interested, she feels terrible. I am not interested, and she should. Giorgio, come on. I've been with you for 14 years, through all of them. You've never been this way before. I don't want hear this from you. You'll have to. Whether you admit it or not, the only reason you're standing here is because of that special woman. To be here is my destiny. My affair is none of your affair. It is not for you to judge the way I act. You are only my manager. [Maestro] Giorgio, onstage! [Orchestra playing] [Chorus singing in Italian] Artie, what's with the dragon? Oh, no problem. I'll take care of it. [Dragon roaring] Artie, it's getting worse! This will do it. [Elephantlike roaring] Oh, my god! We got a problem. All I know is when I came in this morning to talk to him, he was gone. Probably halfway to Italy by now. Well, can you blame him? That dragon nearly killed him. It's worse than seven years ago. Well, no. No, look, look. Listen, there's still time. The opening's not until tomorrow night. Yeah-- well, if not, you'll just have to get somebody else. That's all. Of course. As soon as I hear anything. O.k. Well, that looks much better. Why are you gawking at me? I'm not gawking. I'm leering. What if I said nothing happened? You go off to San Francisco, the wine country, and New York with the world's greatest tenor, a romantic Italian, and you're telling me nothing happened? Come on! Excuse US, Mrs. Silver. Come on. Don't do this to me, please! I'm giorgio fini's greatest fan. I got to know. What was he like? What did he wear? What did he sing? He was great, right? Yeah. He was great. I knew it. I knew it! It was probably the most romantic and exciting week I've ever had. He made me feel just like a Princess. Pamela! Don't you come near me! We were just talking about you. Good luck, Mr. Fini. Doctor, would you hold the door? I'll be right back. My patient's on there! I need you. Of course. Your rehearsal was a disaster. Would you be here if it hadn't been? I don't know. Pamela, without you, I am not complete. Was I put here to complete you? No. You are special. Why didn't you say that two days ago? Because I could not. Well, it's too late. Like to hear my opinion? No! No! Hey, wait! I'm strapped in. Don't leave me! Come back here! Hey! Giorgio, let it be. We had a wonderful time together. We had fun, romance, excitement, and a lot of great arguments. Pamela, you have given me strength to face what I have never faced before. I want do something to give you back. But you have. Before I met you, I never said "I love you" to anyone and meant it, and that's a lot, so let's leave it at that. No, we don't leave it at that. Pamela, I love you. Why couldn't you say that in New York? Because if I tell you how I never met anyone like you, then how can I face Carla again? I love Carla, but is not... Like I love you. Pamela, Carla and I... We are comfortable, and this, too, is love, but what you give me back is the passione that I have nowhere else except in my singing. And tomorrow, I go back to the met, whether you come with me or not, but it would be so much sweeter with you. And you can have what you want. When I am here, I am yours. Giorgio, what if part of you isn't enough for me? Then don't say good-bye. Just... Send me the kiss. Are you coming back with me? Si, giorgio. Si. [Chime rings] [Intercom] 10 minutes, please. 10 minutes. Now, don't worry. He'll make it. He'd better, or I'll drop him like a hot potato. There is nothing to worry about, and we've checked everything, and your voice sounds fine, and we went-- nello, maybe it would be easier if you sing the role, too. You like? Very much. It fit good? Perfectly. You know, is pure silk. I am so scared, Pamela. Me, too. But I don't have to go out there. But I do. And you will. In bocca al Lupo. [Speaking Italian] Pamela. Tonight on the stage, I will not be alone. You will be singing with me. I'm honored you'd share that. I have never done this before. And you can't do it now or ever.
