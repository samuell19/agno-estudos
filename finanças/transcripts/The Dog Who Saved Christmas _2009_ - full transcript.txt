The kids are just gonna love it. It's gonna be so much better than last year when we went to your Aunt Jean's. Remember? Oh, well, that was... Oh, oh, oh! Okay, okay. Hurry, hurry! Come on! I hope these aren't breakable. Okay. Okay, come on. Hurry. Oh, my goodness. Careful. Bye-bye. Merry Christmas. Bye. Merry Christmas. Tell your mom I said hi. All right, will do. Merry Christmas.Okay. Bye. Honey! Whoa! Hey, my little, uh, elves. What's going on? Guess what Ricky Jameson said. What's that? Well, hey, what's up with your back? Oh, uh, you know. Sciatica. Christmas sciatica. Christmas what-ica? Uh, sciatica, honey. It's a real ailment. Um, h-hey. Isn't that, uh, Ricky Jameson out there? What do you mean? Yeah. Uh, I don't know. I don't know what I meant. Hey, it's a Christmas miracle! Your back is all better, Daddy! What's that, honey? Oh, uh, no, no. I'm still hurt. I'm gonna go take a nap. Hey, uh, why don't you kids, you know, go make some eggnog or something, okay? You know where the stuff is, right? The, uh, eggnog? Okay. Pull up right here. Bingo. That beauty right there. Looks like a Victorian mansion. Looks like a giant dollhouse. That beauty right there is going to be our last one. Forever? On this block, you idiot. What happened to the rule we had? We couldn't hit two houses on the same block. Forget I ever said it. Beauty like that, rules were made to be broken. Okay. Ka-ching! Ka-ching! George we really need to get that chandelier in the foyer fixed. I don't think that it's safe hanging tied the way it is. It's perfectly safe the way it is, honey. But I'll take a look at it after the holidays. 328 Red Maple? 328 Red Maple? Honey, isn't that the Johnsons' house? Yeah. They were robbed. And this is the second time on this block in a month. That's it, George. We have to get that alarm, especially with Christmas coming. I think we should get a dog for Christmas. A watchdog. A dog! Daddy, can we? I think it's a great idea, sweetheart. What do you think, hon? We have already talked about this, George. I barely have enough time as it is, since I went back to work. Back to work? Honey, you're a seamstress, and you work here at home. I mean, what's the big deal? I am a costume maker, and it is a big deal. How am I gonna take care of a dog when I have 15 wigs to weave before New Year's Eve? I can walk him and feed him before I go to work in the morning, and then when I come home for lunch, I could check on him. Plus, I could, you know, weave some of those wigs with you. I don't know. George, it's a new house, and dogs are messy, and they chew things and... If we're gonna get a pet, we should get a cat, with this mouse problem we're having. Oh, no! That's not good. Yeah, but, Mom, we want a dog for Christmas. Yeah! A big fluffy dog with long blond hair and floppy ears. Come on, Mom. Come on, Mom. Okay, we will discuss this later. Come on. You're gonna miss the bus. Let's go, let's go. Say goodbye to your father. Bye, Daddy. Have a good day, Ben. I'll help you get your jacket, okay? I'll be right out. Promise me. You will not buy a dog before we have had a chance to talk about it again. I promise. Thank you. How you doing? Hey! How you doing? Good, very good. I'm George Bannister, and I think I'm ready to adopt. Well, I'm Benny. Nice to meet you, George. You wanna adopt a dog? We are in the market for a watchdog. Watchdog! Well, today we're running a special. It's Christmas. Why not be special? You adopt one dog, you get another one for free. Aw, that's okay. I think one dog's plenty, you know. That's good. It's a free dog. Yeah, if I, uh, ever brought home two dogs, the wife would put me in the pound. We can use another dog around here. Tell you what I'll do. How about I throw in some doggie biscuits, a rubber ball, and a doggie bone? Oh, that'd be great. Okay, well, sign right in, and I'll bring you right around.Okay. Yeah, we got one. Yeah, get it ready. Oh, level one. You know, some people think those are cookies, and they eat 'em. They're doggie biscuits. Come on. That's, uh... that's somethin' else. Come on in. Look! There's somebody who could take me home. If I could only bark to get his attention. Zeus, you saying you can't even bark? If you can't bark, you ain't got a chance. The pound. Isn't it a little excessive with the bars. It has to be, man. We got some of the most highly profiled dogs right behind these bars. I mean, they're mentally just challenged as far as who to bite. So I separate them from the family dogs, from the good dogs. Hey there! Buck up, boys. One of us is going home for the holidays. Oh, I hope it's me. Please, kind sir! Please take me! I beg of you! There are all type of dogs in here. You gotta know what you're doing when you're at the pound, man. Well, I'm looking for a family dog and, you know, one that's nice but tough. Tough? Well, I think I got just the dog for you. Yeah, we call this one the Bronx. What do you know about the Bronx? From what I know, it's tough. Tough like big, tough. Well, this one, his mother was a boxer, and his daddy was a pit bull. How they got together and made a dog, I don't know, but he looks like a bulldog r-r-right all in the face. Look at him right there. Look at him! The Bronx! The Bronx? Yeah. Looks more like Staten Island. You want a beef with me? My mother's from Staten Island! Come on. He's small right now, but give him time. He'll balloon into a beast in months. Hey, Bronky! Bronky! Ruff! I don't know if I have the kind of time to wait for him to balloon. What about that guy over there? Yes! Great choice! That one? Oh, you want something aggressive, huh? Look at the chompers on that one. Look at 'em. Yeah, he can bite. He's looking at you, too. He's ready to attack for you. Hey, Noodles! Come here, Noodles! Noodles? That doesn't sound like a watchdog to me. Does it matter what you call him? He's aggressive. What about that one? Get me out of here, please! The food's terrible! I have no hot water, and I think I have fleas! The quiet one in the corner? Yeah, yeah, over there in the back. My god, that is the splitting image of the one I had when I was a kid. So Zeus is what you want, huh? Zeus? Yeah. Now, that's a guard dog. Yeah, but if you're a dog, you at least have to bark. I mean, that dog, to be honest, I never heard him bark. I don't know. I mean, you know, I didn't speak till I was six. My mom thought I was a mute. You happy about that? I am now 'cause I can speak. The only thing I can tell you about Zeus is he used to be a former police dog. K-9 cop. Really? Yeah. Got a plaque, couple awards. But right now he's just a quiet dog. C-Can I pet him? Yeah, why not? Open up family pound number nine. We're going in. Come on. You want me to come in with you? Come on, come on. Get back! Come on. Back, get back. Stay close to me. Here we go. Is this safe? Safe? It's very safe. Except for that one. He may make a pass on your leg right there, but shake it off. Zeus! Wake up, Zeus! Hi. I'm Zeus. And believe me, the pleasure is all mine. Hey, Zeus! How are ya, buddy? Huh? You wanna come home with me? Yeah? Do you want a nice family? Yeah? Are you kidding? Does a dog pee on a fire hydrant? Does a flea itch? Does a... Yeah, yeah, this is the one, Benny. All right. Hey, open up, okay? We're coming down. Get the papers ready for Zeus. Yeah. Bye, Zeus. Nice to meet you. Aww... Got room for one more?

So as long as you don't do anything I do, you're cool. She's gonna love you. I hope so, Georgie. I'd hate to go back to that pound. Okay, let's go. Hey, everybody! Look what I got! A dog! We got a dog! A dog! A dog! This is gonna get interesting. All right, Dad! Daddy got a dog! Where'd you get the dog, Dad? Hey, there! How you doing? Isn't he great? His name is Zeus. Zeusie! You know, like the Greek god. Yeah, well, just Zeus, honey. Hi! Hi! Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure! In the kitchen. Oh, inside? Yeah. Oh, they love him already. Uh-oh. It's the kitchen talk. That's not good at all. Uh-oh. Something tells me Georgie forgot to clear me with the missus. George, you promised you wouldn't buy a dog until we talked. Yeah, and I didn't break that promise. Boy Scout's honor. I didn't buy the dog. I adopted him. Oh, George! I-I-I know, I know, but it's that time of year where you take care of the less fortunate. He was homeless, Belinda, and he reminded me so much of Duke that I couldn't even resist... I know that you had to put your childhood dog to sleep and you have been traumatized ever since. I am not traumatized. And don't make it out to be more than what it is. The kids wanted a dog, so I just thought... Yeah, exactly! You thought. You completely disregarded what I said. This is about the protection of our home, not about you making up for some childhood loss. That hurt. For your information, I am thinking about the protection of our home. Oh, you are? He is a certified, award-winning K-9 police dog. A K-9? The most highly trained dogs and the most intelligent dogs on the planet. He's the ultimate watchdog, and we have one. What? I-I don't know, George. It... It just seems like an alarm would be so much safer and easier. All right, Belinda, trust me, okay? These K-9s are so highly trained, they're practically self-sufficient. And as far as security? Ha ha! They are notorious for being the most toughest and most masculine dogs around. Oh, wha... I... What? What's everybody staring at? Ohh!

Yeah, bring me to Granny's! Come on, Zeus, off the bed! Come on! Off the bed! But I can't help it. This memory foam does wonders for my hinds. How many times do I have to tell this dog? Where is he going? Oh, Zeus! Cut it out! That's disgusting! Come on! Gimme a sec! I'm dying of thirst here! Come on, Mom, please? Can we? Can we bring Zeusie to Grandma's? Oh, I don't think so, honey. Please? Yeah, well, it's boring at Grandma's. All she has to drink is flat diet soda. And prune juice. Okay, now be nice, kids. Yeah, but why do we have to go there every Christmas Eve? Because it's tradition. What's tradition? It's something that you have to do, even though you may not want to. And no one should be alone on Christmas Eve. Mom, what if Santa decides not to come to our house because he doesn't think we'll be here? Oh, sweetheart, Santa knows everything. So he knows that we'll be back first thing Christmas morning. Mom, how come the Cat Lady doesn't have any Christmas lights? I just... Honey, I've really got a headache. This is a lot of questions. I don't know why the Cat Lady doesn't have Christmas lights. Yeah, well, Ricky Jameson says it's 'cause she's an old Scrooge. Okay, well, you know, you tell Ricky Jameson that in this house, we don't judge people that we do not know. Does that mean that we judge people that we do know? No. No, no, no. We don't judge anyone. Where's that dog? What... Get away from there now! - I am not gonna tell you again! - Are you listening to me? Well, the stores were just completely packed. Yeah, see, that's why I don't go to the stores anymore. That's why I send you, honey. Well, you're gonna love what I got you. Aww. You know, I told you, I didn't want anything more than... Ooh, gingerbread! I love me some gingerbread! Hey, Mom, look what Zeusie can do. Ooh! That smells good, George. Come on, share. Get down. Ooh, that's... Ooh, that's good. He's fine. Okay. I don't know what that was.Mmm. Delicious! You know, honey, it's funny, but I don't think I've ever heard Zeus bark. Oh, sure, honey. Yeah, Zeus barks. They, uh... You might not have heard him yet, but, uh, you know, they're highly trained dogs. They're very intelligent. They go through a rigorous training program where they teach them to bark on command and when to bark, when not to bark. They don't always bark. If they always barked, it gets to be kind of annoying, you know? They have to bark where there's a noise and not bark where there's no noise. That's how you want the dog. But they need some kind of a stimulation. They need another dog barking or a human bark or a door knock or a doorbell, you know? Mmm! I smell shrimp toast. Hey, Old Yeller, why don' t you just go ahead and bark already? You call that a dog? Is somebody gonna get that? I'm starving over here. Come on, Georgie, you know I don't have thumbs. Ah, don't worry about it, Zeus. We'll get you next time. You'll bark next time. Bark? Oh, no, not that again. Hey. Goldman's Chinese Food. Yes, of course, yeah. Merry... Hanukkah. Happy Holidays. Close enough. $32.75. Okay, here's 40.Oh, thank you. Thank you. Very nice. Yeah, we're building a little gingerbread house there. I meant the girl, not the house. Oh. Oh! Oh, the girl, yeah. Yeah, she's kosher, too. Hi! Very nice. Merry Christmas. Happy... That would be my wife. Thank you. Thank you. Shalom.Shalom. Well, that was awkward. You know what? You'll bark next time. Who cares? It's all good. Who cares if I didn't bark? The Bannisters love me for who I am, and that's the important thing. You just look very tense. I mean, I know this is all new for you, but we're gonna take it one step at a time, okay? Uh, this is a little awkward, George, don't you think? Yeah. There we go, Zeusie. Is that better? Ooh. What did they do to you? Ooh, yeah. Now I'm diggin' it. Made you all silly-looking. It's only you and me. We're the men of the house. Men of the house. Yeah, right! You know what I'm talking about? Ooh. Right there, George. You know what it's like to be a man? Yeah, dude. I was the only one. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. Besides Ben. Ahh! But now it's me, you, and Ben.

It's the worst-case scenario. Are you saying that the dog is never gonna bark? I'm saying there's nothing I can do, except recommend a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist? Hey, mister, you got any more meat for me? Well, given his K-9 background. Oh, for Zeus. It's entirely possible he suffered some sort of psychological trauma on the job. Sorry, chief. I have no idea what you're saying. I only speak Dog in English. I am sorry, George. Aw, come on! I knew it was a trick! Have him break in again. I'll tackle him. You think there's anything we can do after the holiday? He failed the steak test, guys. Now I'm good, but you're gonna need a miracle worker to turn that dog around. Merry Christmas. Therapist? I don't need a therapist. Just give me another chance. I can bark. Really, I can. Aw, what's the use. I'm sorry, guys. I'm really sorry. I might've messed this up, too. First of all, he is a dog, and dogs teethe. He's not teething. He's four years old, and that is 30 in human years. Uh, it's 28, Einstein, and his birth date is still in question. George, I just don't think that after today's session with Franz that Zeusie is working out. First of all, his name is Zeus, okay? Like the Greek god. Don't get testy with me, George. I am just saying that we got the dog in order to protect our home and the children, and we agreed that we would either have an alarm or the dog. Belinda, stop with the alarm already, okay? We have a top-notch security guard dog in our hands. Case closed. George, why is it that everyone else but you can see that Zeusie is not what you think he is? Okay, so then why don't we get a psychiatrist like Franz suggested? That is ridiculous. Not ridiculous. And you know what? The FDA just approved a dog antidepressant. Maybe that'll free up his mind a little bit. Doggie antidepressants? Yes! You know, I just don't wanna give up on this whole thing, Belinda. And those kids, they're not gonna forgive you. Oh, the kids will be fine. The kids are kids, and they will learn to love the next dog. You, it seems, will never forgive me. I have an idea.Good. Look, George, I can see that this is very upsetting for you, so I am willing to make a compromise. After the holidays, we'll bring Zeus back to the pound, and then we'll invest in a real watchdog, okay? I don't think we should give up on him so fast. Oh, why are you so attached to this dog? Because he's underestimated, and I know exactly how that feels. Okay. But promise me. Promise me that if things don't improve by the time we go to my mom's... Deal? Deal. Okay, so you have to surprise Mom and Dad with a nice loud bark before Christmas Eve. I wouldn't bet on it. Come on, Zeusie! Ruff! Come on, Zeusie boy, you can do it. You can do it, Zeusie! Come on! Come on! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Come on, come on, come on. Ruff, ruff, ruff! Okay, I'll give it a shot. Rrr... Rrr... Come on! Ruff, ruff! Come on! Ruff, ruff, ruff! Yeah, go woof! Come on. Woof, woof. Woof, woof, woof. Come on, Zeusie boy. Kids, please, please! Go to bed! Ah, I told you, I don't like tuna fish. Ruff, ruff! Come on. Do it with us. Ruff, ruff, ruff! Come on! Woof! Woof! Hey, who's that? She's back. Ricky Jameson says the Cat Lady hates dogs so much that she calls the pound up to make more room for cats. So she lures the dogs in with her homemade stew and then calls the pound up as they're eating it. I heard that she hates dogs so much that she called the pound on her own dog. So stay far, far away from her, and no matter what you do, never, ever eat her stew. Never, ever, ever. Got it. No stew. She sees us! She sees us! What are you guys doing? What do I do? Where do I hide? Ooh! I think she saw me! All right, my little working elves. Ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho! Now for the fun part. Uh, remember, we've been working on this a long time, and it is kind of fragile, right? And it is our gift to the grandma. Right. You know. Yeah. So just be careful. Keep placing the details now. We're on the details. All right. Where do I put these? Oh, anywhere, sweetheart. Anywhere your little heart desires. Now remember, if we do a very nice job this year, Grandma will probably make you some of those knitted Christmas booties she made you last year. Oh, golly gee. Just what I wanted, another pair of Christmas booties. Easy, buddy. She's still your grandmother. Ooh. There's those cheese-eaters again. You bet your bottom bumpkin. Maybe if I catch them, I can earn my keep, prove to the Bannisters I'm worthy. Okay, I think we're just about finished. You know what? We should get this upstairs before Mom comes home. She'll be home any minute. I'm gonna get you, rats! Better bring your A-game, you crude K-9 corn dog. What was that? Is that Zeus? I don't know. Yeah. All right. Hey, Ben, can you help me on the other side there, buddy? All right. Careful, sweetheart. Don't hurt yourself. I won't. All right. You wanna help out, that's okay. Ha ha! I got you now! Right where I want you! Hey, is that gingerbread? Ooh, I love gingerbread! Oh, yes! No, Zeus, get back! Aah! Ah... Oh, my god! Naagh! Rrr! Oh, no! Daddy, you're in a lot of trouble. Yeah, I know, honey. Looks like you and Zeus are in the doghouse. What else is new? Come on. We better go clean this up. I agree. Oh, great. Now Belinda's really gonna send me back to the pound. Oh, great. It's my number one fan. Boy, do I have terrible timing. Hurry! Gimme that, too. What happened? Nothing. Oh, uh, nothing. Nothing? He didn't do it, Mom. He who? Zeusie. Hey, do you kids know where the glue is? I wanna fix the, uh... The glue's behind me? Glue's... The glue! Hey! Hey, you are the glue, honey, that, uh, that keeps our family together. What is going on here? Uh, nothing. We just had a little accident. George, we spent two weeks making that gingerbread house. Mommy, I'm sorry. I tripped 'cause it was loose. No, no, what happened was I was coming in with the cake... The two of them were helping me, and I had it too high, and there was a cord there, I didn't see it. Where... is the dog? Upstairs. Doing what? I don't know. You know, dog things. George! That is the only thing that she wanted for Christmas. And what happened to that? I did that, Mommy. I'm sorry. I-I tripped, and I knocked it over off the... Yeah. She did. She broke... Ohhh! Where you going? I am going to the bakery to buy a gingerbread house. All right. Drive safe. There's a lot of traffic. Thank you, honey. That's very sweet of you. Ben, you should be ashamed of yourself. You should have claimed that. I can't do anything right. I'm a poor excuse for a dog. I couldn't mark my own territory in sandbox. I couldn't play fetch with a boomerang. I couldn't... Ah, what's the use. It's deja vu all over again. Only this time, it's the Bannisters that I'm letting down. Come, Zeus! Zeus! Stop, drop, and roll! I'm coming, George! I'll save you! I'll get you and Belinda out safely! Follow me! Hey. Oh, hey, George. I just had this crazy dream. I was barking up a storm. And I saved you and Belinda! Oh, it was epic! How you doing? Listen, about that gingerbread incident? I was only trying to catch those mice... Listen... and they were going one way, and I smelled the gingerbread, I don't know how to tell you this, but... and I got confused and... Georgie! Stop playing with Duke! It's time for dinner! Belinda... You know Belinda. Belinda thinks it's best if... if we took you back to the pound. What? You gotta talk some sense into her. You can't send me back, George. What about that whole "It's only me and you" thing? We're actually running a little late to Grandma's house, so... No, no, no! George, George, George, wait, wait, wait, please. You can't give up on me. Not you. I'm gonna have to take care of all this in the morning. I can drop you off then. No, George. Please. You can't give up on me. I promise... Listen, there's plenty of, uh, water and food, so, you know, make yourself feel at home. No! No, you can't give up on me! I promise! I'll be a good dog! I won't break anything! I'll learn how to bark! Sorry, buddy. Guess it wasn't just meant to be. Of course it's meant to be! You and I, George! We're like peanut butter and jelly. Salt and pepper. We just go together. George, where you going? Hey, kids! You can't leave me! It's Christmas!

See you later, okay? Okay? See you later. See you later. You know, wait, Ben! Don't go, Ben. Please, I'll do better. I promise. Ben! Don't go! Oh, no. No, Kara. Kara, don't cry. Kara, it's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Look at the size of that house. I know. Look. They're going on a trip. We just caught a break. It's gonna make our job so much easier. How? Where do you think they're going? Who cares where they're going? They're going. That's gonna make our job easier. Look at that snowman. And look at those wreaths. Those are real wreaths right there. Those aren't wreaths that you just buy at the corner. Somebody took the time and made those. Those gotta go for 100, 90, 80 retail. We could sell those, Ted. Imagine the jewelry, watches, necklaces, electronics. Imagine the kitchen. They got two of 'em. And a freezer downstairs. And that's where they have the meat and the cupcakes. See, I know about that stuff. No, no, no. Stewey, no funny business. We go in, we get the loot, we get out. That's it. Ooh, sorry, kids. I just forgot one thing inside. You have your seatbelt? Maybe they got hot chocolate and marshmallows and cookies and oatmeal cookies. I been away for a long time. That joint, they don't take care of you over the holidays. They give you, you know, pasteurized turkey. You can't live on that stuff for the holidays. Ah. Here we go. Oh, Santa's gonna love Belinda's... homemade chocolate chip cookies. It's funny. She doesn't make the cookies for me. Actually, that might be... one too many. Yeah, I'll eat the rest of those later. You mess this up, you're gonna be back in the joint. Okay? We go in, we get the goods, we get out. That's it. No eatin'. No funny business. This is business-business. You think they got a dog? 'Cause I hate dogs. Ted, I've always hated dogs. Whether they're little, big, small, fat. I don't want no dogs. That time you told me there wasn't a dog, I climb into a doggie window, and there was a dog, and he almost bit me. And I got no insurance this time, so I can't even go to the hospital. I don't want no dogs. I'm telling you right now. I don't want to see a dog. If I see a dog, I'm gonna have an anxiety attack, and I gotta go to the prison acupuncturist and make an appointment. Stewey, what've we been doing for the last two days? Sittin' here. I don't know. Have you heard a dog bark? Exactly. No dog. Okay? This house will finally pay off that debt to Tony Rowe. And I can start my diet. And if we have any money left over, you can get that nose job you always been talkin' about. It's not a nose job. It's... I have a deviated septum. The one in your house, or the one here? It's... It's... It's... It's... at the house. Wait, guys, come back! Don't do this. Don't do this, please! I'm sorry. Okay, George, George, don't leave me. I'm your best friend. George! Oh, no. Bye, Zeusie. Hey, this alone thing ain't so bad after all. I got no one telling me what to do, and I got a whole house to myself. Oh, this part gets me every time. I'm hungry. I'm gonna go look for a little snack. Who says dogs shouldn't be eating candy? All right! Come here. Come here. Droopy ears. What are you looking at? You looking at me? What's your problem? Huh. I smell something. What's that? Cookies? Are those cookies? Yes! Cookies! Come to Zeus, baby. Uhh! Uhh! Got 'em! ♪ Come on, cats It's time to rock ♪ Belinda always said to brush after every meal.

George isn't really bringing me back to the pound. He just wanted to see how I was gonna react. Hello! All right, I'm show him. Anybody home? Wait a minute. These guys don't smell like plumbers. These guys are the real deal. This is definitely not a test. See? Just like I told you. Nobody home. No dog. This is gonna be a piece of cake. I hope you're right, Captain. What did I tell you about calling me that? You said not to call you General. You didn't say nothing about Captain. Don't call me anything. No nicknames.Okay. I gotta do something. These guys are coming to rob the house. I'm gonna get this one. Step aside. You know what you're doing? Yeah. I worked for a locksmith. You forget about these things. Keep your eye out there. Ahh. Come on, baby. How about I let Uncle Stewey teach ya? Yeah, come on, come on. Come on. What's taking so long? Relax. This is my first time. I thought you said you worked for a locksmith. Shh! I did, but I made keys. I know just the thing to get rid of these hooligans. Here. Use this. Now you're talkin'. Step aside. Aah! I don't like dogs. I'm scared of dogs. I don't wanna work with dogs. I'm been tellin' ya that. No! You are going inside. Yes, you are. I hate dogs. They always bite me. Gimme that! Get your hand off! Gimme this! Gimme that thing! Stewey, stop it! Stop it! I swear to god! What's wrong with you? Look! Look! Oww! Oww! I'm not going in there with dogs! I hate dogs! We're coming back here in two hours. I got a plan for that dog. I'm not going in. Shh! Hey, Dad, when are we gonna get there? Trust me, son. When we get there, we will be there. Hey, Mom, when are we gonna get there? Kids, why don't we sing a Christmas song? A happy song. That's a great idea, honey. ♪ Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Through the fields we go ♪ Laughing all the way Ha ha ha ♪ Well, Benji, we're finally here. The Bannisters made it to Grandma's. Great. Flat soda and stale pretzels, here we come. Hey, it's Christmas. Show some Christmas spirit, will ya? Great pretzels, Mom. Oh, I made 'em. When? Last Christmas? Well, it's German. It should be hard. Hey, not at the table. Pretzel? Oh, you love those, honey. Yeah, not those. Well, what are we doing? Look at this! We are making popcorn. Oh, this is gonna be so fun, huh? Isn't it? Yeah. Come on. Cheer up. Santa's gonna be here later. He is. I hope somebody's been good. Oh, we're gonna have to leave some milk and cookies out for Santa 'cause he gets hungry, you know. What's the matter? Who's gloomy? Who are gloomy-faces? Santa's not gonna like that, or his elves, so somebody better smile. Oh! This one broke. Come on, guys. This is fun. You know, Santa is looking right now down from the chimney and going, "Hmm, I don't know if I wanna visit those kids. They're not very happy." Ah, let's face it. I'm just no good at confrontation anymore. These paws have seen better days. I'm a has-been or maybe worse: a never-was. I won't let these guys ruin Christmas. I'm gonna go out and get some help. And when these guys come back, they are gonna be sorry. All I have to do is sneak past the crazy Cat Lady's house. Come on, you can do it. Mush! Mush! Mush, Zeus! No stoppin' until I... Ohh! Tree branch. Oh, that's gonna leave a mark! Huh? Where am I? What is this place? Oh, no! I'm in the cat's den with that crazy cat broad! Wait! What's with the poker? Hey, buddy. Stew? Uh-oh. It might be laced! How you doing? But I'm starving! You were out cold. We fixed you up pretty good, didn't we, Chegwee? Unfortunately. You just don't listen to those stories the kids tell. You know, people get the wrong idea. They think 'cause I don't put any lights outside for Christmas, I'm a Scrooge. Truth is, I just don't have anybody to help me. That's what happens when you outlive most of your family. That's why it's just Chegwee and me. So don't worry. I'm not gonna send you to the pound anytime soon. Well, that's a relief. If you behave. Say what? You hungry? You know, I could really go for... some of that stew right now. Oh, no! Wait! What am I saying? You stay there. Hey, you. What's your name? Zeus. Why are you whispering? You know she can't hear us, right? Yeah, right. Keep it down. So what's it like being a dog? Today it stinks. What's it like being a cat? It's not so bad. You get to spy on people through windows and poop inside. Keep it down. Here she comes. Mm-mm! Christmas feast. Stew! Yeah! A dog's best friend! All right. No sign of poison. Whoa! You were hungry. All right! Mmm! This is some tasty stew. Well done, Cat Lady. You know... I've been watching you. And I don't mean to pry or get personal, but... I've noticed you don't bark. Great. Does everybody on the block know I can't bark? What are you afraid of? Let's just say the last time I barked, something bad happened. Now everything's all messed up, and I don't know what to do. Fear is a funny thing. You let it in, and it starts to overtake every part of your life. Long time ago, my dog Rufus, he attacked me. Yeah. I found out the hard way he didn't like dried kibble. She's still feeding me kibble. Thanks. One day he just snapped. Tore through my best sweater like a wild hyena. I had to give him away. Which is probably where the rumor got started. And for the longest time, I-I was afraid of every dog. And then one day I realized that it was silly to let one incident make me afraid of all dogs. Everybody has fears. But you just gotta face 'em. And when you do, they go away. They do? Well, I was the number one K-9 in my division... until that day. Get down, Zeus! Get down! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Stop barking! Stop barking! Stay back! Get him back! It was my fault. Because of my barking, I blew a five-year investigation. And to top it off, my partner broke his trigger finger. He was never able to shoot straight again. You can't use what happened as an excuse to stop being what you are. You gotta be what you were meant to be and... do what you were meant to do. Hey, this old cat may have a point. Come on, Chappy! Come on! You can do it! This is gonna hurt you. You're the greatest dog of all! All right, son. Thank you. He'll just use his powerful sense of smell and pinpoint... I wish we could keep Zeusie. Yeah, I bet Zeus could do that. No, honey, this is just a TV show. In real life, dogs can't do that. Yes, they can. No, they can't. That's what they are made for. Don't tell them that. That's not true. I'm telling them what's in the magazine. The magazine is not correct. What are you watching? Oh, Chappy the Dog. Oh! What's going on? Why do you think I read this thing? I don't know why you read this thing. This is absurd. Well, it's to inform myself. That is not a real dog. Yes, it is. It's a good magazine. It's Christmas. I don't care. It's a good magazine. Oh, I've seen this episode. Do you know what's gonna happen? Chappy is gonna get to that girl before her mother does, and then Chappy's gonna save that little girl, and then... Grandma, do you mind? Sorry. I could be the dog I once was. I was trained to fight crime, and that's what I'm gonna do. When those perps come back, you bet Chegwee's whiskers I'll be ready! Okay, I need to gather weapons and ammo. Can't use those. Too small. Okay, lemme see, lemme see, lemme see, lemme see. Ooh! Maybe I can use Santa as a decoy. No, no, too big, too big. Bingo! Yes! My K-9 sense is tingling. Peek-a-boo, you robbers, you! You definitely wanna do this? Yeah. Turn the car off. All right, remember what I said: no funny business. Define funny business. Like that time on the Smith Street job, when I walked in on you, and you were raiding the refrigerator. Prune juice, liverwurst, and potato chip sandwiches? That's funny business. I was constipated. Liverwurst sandwich. They didn't have no bologna. You know I like my bologna fresh, thin-sliced from the butcher, not that supermarket stuff. And we've been together how long now? You know that whenever we pull a job, I get anxiety. And anxiety causes me to get gas, or B: hunger. What would you rather do? Me blow a couple farts, or me eat a sandwich? What would you rather me do? Stewey! No funny business. No funny business. No funny business. I guess hunger's funny business. You understand? I told you I got a plan. I came prepared. That's why I brought this muzzle. I'm not putting that on. It's for the dog, you numbskull. It's a muzzle. How are you gonna put it on the dog? Well, that's what this is for. Mace? This don't work. If it doesn't, my backup plan. I got a tranquilizer gun. Where'd you get that from? From the last house we boosted. Guy was a vet. You're a genius. I'm gonna hit this door right here. Keep an eye out for this cat lady and whoever else. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Yeah! Take that! Oww! Oh! Who's a tough guy now, huh? Oww! What was that? Boom goes the dynamite! You idiot! Take another! What? What'd I do? You said the house was clear! And another! We seen 'em leave, didn't we? Who's doing that then, the mutt? I'm shelling you now. Can't be the mutt alone. They must've left one of the kids behind to watch him. You boys look a little dirty. Ah, this oughta do the trick. Here we go. Let's give you a little flour shower. Let's get him. Let's get him. We'll use the basement. He can't drop stuff on us this way. Oh, there's more where that came from. Enter at your own peril. I'm just gonna kick in the basement door. If there's kids in there, then there's no way the alarm is turned on. I think I broke my ankle! I told you this was a bad idea, Ted! Shh! You're breathing so hard. What's wrong with you? Forget that plant. Come on. Okay. You go this way. I'll go this way. Yell if you hear the boy. Here's a little gutter ball for ya. Steee-rike! Ted, where'd you go? Ted? Ted? Ahh... Stewey! Okay. This is it. It's now or never. If I bark loud enough, that cat broad will call me some backup. Teddy? Teddy? Hi, li'l boy. Stewey here. Don't be scared. I'm not gonna hurt you. As a matter of fact, I got a pork chop in my pocket. With some cookies. Hey, it's Christmas. And you and me, we're gonna be buddies, and we're gonna have a good time. Good time. Yeah. Let's start by playing pin the cuffs on the robbers. Don't move. It's gonna be fine. I'm gonna just reach in my pocket... Bark, you fool! Bark! and get you this little treat, okay? Like I said... Uncle Stewey's here, and we're gonna make everything fine. Oh, he got me with the oldest trick in the book: the old muzzle over the noggin. Gotcha. Where's the kid? He's not around. Huh? Listen, I looked in every crack in this shack. There's nothing. No kid, no nobody. That's impossible. Are you sure? Everywhere. Under the beds. I checked the windows. They were closed. I'm telling you, there's nobody here. Well, if there's no kid, then who sabotaged us? Yours truly. That's ridiculous. You're telling me. Look at this. What's that? K-9... Zeus? I don't believe it. We're dealing with a certified K-9. Wow. A real police dog. I seen a whole special about these guys. Wait a second. It's him. This dog is one of the smartest dogs in the world. Give me the stick here. Apparently he ain't that smart. Talk is cheap where I come from, marshmallow man. Wait, wait, wait! Let me smash him. No. First we get what we came for. Then you can do whatever you want to, okay? I don't like dogs. Ted, you always make me feel a lot better. I'm gonna make you suffer, then suffer some more, and then you're gonna know what pain is. Let's get out of here. Come on. Here, hold this. Nice picture. Well, that went well. Mommy, I miss Zeusie. Yeah, me, too. Can we go get him? Please? Please? It is Christmas Eve. Yeah, Mom. You always said, "No one should be home alone for Christmas Eve." Yeah, you said that. Maybe we shouldn't have left him alone. He could be destroying the house as we speak. So let me go get him. I'll be back in a couple hours. We wanna go, too. Yeah, can we come? Sure. Let's do it. All right. Let's go, let's go. Hey, what if we run into Santa on the way? Oh, don't worry, sweetheart. Santa's reindeer is no match for the Bannister sleigh. That is right. Let's go. Shh! Don't wake up Grandma. Where'd you go? What? Wait for me! What are those guys doing downstairs? I gotta get out of here. Ah! A house this nice, and all they got is prepackaged bologna? Unbelievable. Ahh! What are you doing? Nothing. What'd I tell you? I told you no funny business. Ted, I've been through the ringer today. Let me just eat something in peace. We've been in this house too long already. Do you want to go back to jail? I'll probably get better bologna there. You're better than that, Stewey. Come on! Ah, maybe they got better bologna in the fridge downstairs. This is worse than the time I got dognapped by that crazy clown who shot me out of a cannon twice a week for a month. Almost got it, almost. Come on. Almost... Boo yah! These guys are loaded. Why are you eating again? I told you don't eat. I'm hungry. You had... You just ate two seconds ago. That was a long time ago. Cops! Cops! That was subtle. Shh! Who's out there? The cops. What do they want? They want to wish you a Merry Christmas. Really? No! They're patrolling the neighborhood. What do you think? Shh! You breathe so loud. Hello? Police! Anybody here? Stop it. When I'm nervous, I pass gas. It's anxiety, you know. Well, cork it up. Ugh! You smell that, man? I think they can hear that. What is that? Ohh! Ah, it's burning. It burns. Does yours burn? No, mine doesn't burn. I'm out of here. No, don't! Forget the sandwich. I want my sandwich. Stop it! Stop it! Let's get out of here. Oh, god! We're going to jail for sure. I knew we should not have done this. We shouldn't have broke the rule. Break the rule? This is all your escapade. Remember, in the car? "We do one more heist, we can pay off Tony Rowe." That was you, remember? I didn't say that. You said that. You lyin' skunk. You also said you were gonna get the money and get a nose job. You said that! I don't need a nose job. Whatever. Some plumbers. They probably broke a gas pipe. That's what it was. 145 Second Avenue. 10-96. Oh, we just caught a break. All right, let's get our gear, all the loot, and let's get out of here.
