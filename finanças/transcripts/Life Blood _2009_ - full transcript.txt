Avocado burger, no fries! This food sucks. Woman: It's coming up! There you go, sweetie. Can I get you ladies anything else? I think we're okay. Thank you. Honey, we're all god's creatures. You see, there came a time when the world became so evil that god made it rain for 40 days and 40 nights, killing all those who were corrupt. And so it came to be that only two of each creature were left. She started over. And to keep control of the evil that exists here on earth, she created angels in her image to do her work. We serve the highest purpose. It is up to us to rid the world of these people. ♪ I'm just mad about saffron ♪ ♪ saffron's mad about me ♪ ♪ I'm just mad about saffron ♪ ♪ she's just mad about me ♪ ♪ they call me mellow yellow ♪ ♪ quite rightly ♪ they call me mellow yellow ♪ ♪ quite rightly ♪ they call me mellow yellow... ♪ ♪ I'm just mad about...

Turn the car around. I mean it, Brooke. I want to go home. I love you, rhea. You know that, right? I've done something bad. Just tell me. What is it? I've screwed up, baby! I'm in trouble. You see, this place is filled with lame cats in their little clustered groups all racing for his or her conversational turn, only to express their highly highly dogmatic point of view which usually consists of nothing. Where's the real moment? I've got a question for you, Warren. What girl falls for the mouthfuls of crap that constantly come out of your mouth? Yeah, Warren, you're serving it up lukewarm. You were great in that movie. Bang. Thanks. Ladies, don't make me choose somebody else. Who's it gonna be? Brooke? Or rhea? Or both? Eeny meeny miney... Moe. It's gonna be midnight in less than 20 minutes. Warren, I'd hate for you to miss the opportunity to indulge one of your adoring fans. I don't know, Warren. I think rhea and I are gonna share this new year's moment alone. Hmm. I'll be out by the pool. Hey, baby. - Hi! - I'm back. You must be a movie buff. I am a movie buff. Really? What your name? Carrie Lane. Carrie Lane-- sounds like a wonderful name. Thank you. You want to go run some lines with me? - Sure. - Come on, let's go for a walk. So do you think there's anything in moon man's stories? Of course not. He's as full of it as he's ever been. I'll be right back. Can you get me another? I didn't mean to do it! I didn't mean to do it! Shh. Shh. Please, Brooke baby, just tell me what happened. - Warren. - Warren what? You want to know what it's like to be with a movie star, well, here I am. Isn't this fun? Happy new year, baby. - Please don't. - Please don't... stop? Is that what you meant to say? Or are you so caught up in the moment that you're stuttering? Bang! See, everybody wants to be with a movie star. And do you want to know why I get to do anything I want to you? I'll tell you. It's because I get away with everything. See, you may suffer some emotional damage because tonight didn't go exactly how you imagined, but you're not gonna tell anybody about tonight because who would believe you? They'll say, "Warren James could never do a thing like that." God, I love this town. Now... If you let out one little peep, I'm gonna leave a Mark on you that you're never gonna forget. So do something to excite me. Now that's a good girl. That's a good girl. That's very good. You see? It's not so bad, is it? What are you doing? Hey! Welcome to the party, Brooke! I didn't think you were gonna make it so I started alone. Help me! You sick bastard! Have you lost your mind? Have you? You know who I am?! I'm Warren James! You're just some stupid fucking model who's supposed to keep her mouth shut, look pretty and do what she's told. Can I leave, please? Listen, if you like your life the way it is, you'll keep living it the same way-- pretty and mouth shut. So either join in, baby, or turn around and get the fuck out of here. I'm not leaving, Warren. And you're going down for this. You are so funny, Brooke. I can't believe you fell for it. I am a great actor! I mean, I knew this was a great performance, but this-- this was a great scene. Admit you fell for it. Like I was really gonna hit her with a bar of soap. She was even better than I thought. You were great. Come on, baby, let me help you up. It's okay. Come on, the scene's over now. Whatever. I was trying to give someone a few pointers. No thanks. You can look at me all you want, Brooke. It ain't gonna change a thing.

I can't believe Warren's dead. That's your response? "I can't believe Warren's dead"? Would you rather it had been me? Of course not. I just can't believe it. Which part? That Warren's dead or that I did it? Both, I guess. We need to turn around and go back. We can tell the police what happened. I told you the truth. So now you know, okay? I can't go back. I killed him. I just wish I could take the top down and let this warm desert air cleanse my body. Please, Brooke, just turn around and go home. This feels really wrong. What is that? Brooke: Weird. Maybe it's a sign. A sign of what? I don't know. This is more than just a sign. Oh, shit! Look out! What is happening? I can't take it! I can't take it! Just pull the car over! No, I'm just gonna keep driving. I can't have any more death. Just pull the car over! Rhea! What is happening?! Why did Warren die? What is going on? That possum wasn't hurting anyone. He was just sitting there. And we came along and hit him! Everything's dying. What does it mean?! I don't want to hurt anyone. Of course you don't, baby. You've got a heart of gold. What is the matter with you? I don't know what is happening! You are overreacting. You killed Warren and that possum. I just want to go home. I didn't kill anybody. That possum walked out on the road on its own free will. It was an accident. It was a sign. I know it. I feel it. You don't know the things I feel. I've always felt things. But I just don't understand. Rhea, you are overreacting. Now Warren died tonight because it was supposed to happen. It was his fate. I didn't kill him. He killed himself. He made the choice to walk out on the road just like that possum did. I'm more sad about the possum than I am Warren. Are you even listening to me? Rhea! Warren deserved to die. He deserved it. I am happy he's dead. He tried to rape a girl. He's a pathetic human being whose life was taken because of his own actions. Would you rather it had been me? Is that what you would've wanted? Is it?! No. What is that? What's happening? What's happening? Come on, baby. Let's go. Brooke! No! You want me? What are you doing?! I'm gonna kill you! No! Rhea. You have been chosen. Don't be afraid. I'm not. You've lived your life with such purity and honesty, but it's time that you serve a greater purpose. And with it will come the gift of eternal life. I love her. I know that you're in pain, but you will understand. The future will bring many decisions. The world can be an evil place. Once, I made it rain for 40 days and 40 nights and I killed almost everything. In order for that to never happen again, I created angels in my image to rid the world of these evils. You shall kill to survive. And the truly wicked are the ones you must destroy. Do you understand? I do. Brooke does not have a pure heart. She preys on the weak. - You don't know her. - I know all. And remember these words: You are not exempt from evil. So choose your work carefully. Please can you bring her back to life? Rhea, you have such a pure heart. I can only do so by making her what you are. And if I do so, it will come with a price. She, ultimately, will be your true test. I promise you, we will make you proud. Drink from me. God: You've lived your life with such purity and honesty... But it's time that you serve a greater purpose. And with it will come the gift of eternal life. This ain't no cockfight! Announcer: Welcome to the new year's Eve "chics chasing chicken" special. Boy, these girls just love chasing cock. I'm excited about today. I think I can catch me one of them cocks. This is my cock call: Click-click-click-click! Here! - Cock cock cock cock! - Did you hear that thunder? Yeah. Winter heat wave-- must be that global warming thing. Hey! I didn't know they were doing a new year's Eve special. Now I heard cocks like pussy. I've got a pussy. I'm gonna get me some cotton balls, I'm gonna rub it all on my pussycat. This ain't no cockfight. We've got no broads like this out in this part of the godforsaken world. Anyone want more coffee? Sounds great. Maybe you could bake some cookies while you're at it. Anything you say, sir. I'll give you a hand. You know, till, one of these days they're gonna nail you on sexual harassment. They can do that, you know. What'd I say? Come on. I caught the cock! I caught the cock! I'm a winner. "Chics chasing chickens." We're different. What has happened to me? You look the same as I do. We've been like this for 40 years. Are we dead? - Did I die? - No. We are more alive than ever. Come on. We have to go. We only have a few more hours of darkness. Look at me. I'm a freak. You're a freak. Brooke... You're okay. Think about this very moment 40 years ago. Our minds and bodies are stronger than they ever have been. This should seem like yesterday. Time is now eternal. What are you talking about? How about a ride? - What the heck, man? - Sorry, man. I didn't mean to scare ya. I don't know how you even saw me. I was still standing a couple hundred yards up the road. You see anything strange back here? What do you mean? I could've sworn-- forget about it. I must be really tired. So how about that ride? Yeah, what the hell? I gotta have someone to keep me awake. I think I'm seeing things. Hmm. So we never die? Kind of sounds boring. I didn't say we can't die. What I'm saying is that your power comes from those who are truly evil. It comes from the evil you destroy. Do this and your power will be at its full extent. I think there's something up ahead. Interesting. What do we have here? Everything all right, gentlemen? Bill: What kind of game are you girls up to? It's new year's, bill. Tonight's full of games and new beginnings. And how do you know my name? Unless that isn't your shirt, any literate person would come to the conclusion that your name is bill. Look, I don't have time for any of this crap. I've got a bowling tournament in Vegas. You coming or not? Mind if I grab some chips, bill? I haven't eaten in forever. Sure, go right ahead. Tastes like crap. I don't get it. You on some kind of anti-carb thing? I'm sorry. That wasn't very ladylike. What is that smell? Is that you, bill? Who would've guessed? You smell so good. I could just eat you alive. Hey, I'm married and I got kids. Come on, Brooke. We've got to go. I just want to enjoy bill's aroma a little longer. What is that, very old spice? Brooke, I'm serious. Let's go. Hey hey hey hey. Just slow down now. Nobody's got to be anywhere, it's new year's Eve. You gals didn't get all-- all dressed up for nothing. Right? 'Cause that is the sexiest outfit I have ever seen. Why anybody'd not try to pick you up and take you home is beyond me. You want to take me home, handsome man? I'll take you anywhere you want, baby. It's kind of hard to take me anywhere without a car, isn't it? Why don't you take that thumb of yours that you use to get around and shove it up your ass? Hey-- hey, like I said, I'm married. And I've got a ball to roll. So I'm just going to get going. We must be on our way. I'm so sorry, sir, for the inconvenience. Brooke! Let go of the gentleman! You don't understand how I feel about bill. - I want him. - Hey! Whoa! Why would you want him when you can have me? I want him. Brooke! Rhea: What have you done?! I've never felt more alive. I've never tasted anything so wonderful in all my life. Rhea, you've got to try this. I know we're supposed to kill, but this is wrong. What's wrong? I can't believe what this is like. I can't believe my power. I never imagined it could be so great. If I had known this is what it'd be like, I would've killed forever ago. Taste him. He's amazing. Still want to take me anywhere - I want to go, slick? - Hey. Oh god. I don't know what the hell you are, but just... Let me go on my way. Okay? I-- I didn't do anything. I know you didn't, but I distinctly remember you saying, "why would I have him when I could have you?" And I thought about it. And you were right. I want you. I want you real bad. Okay. Now it's my turn. So sorry. You want me to kiss it better? - Fuck you. - Really? I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let this happen. I am so sorry to you and your family for what we have done. You were a good man. I can feel it. - Forgive me. - Forgive you? Why are you talking to a dead man? What are you doing? I'm just having a little fun. Brooke, this is not a joke. You can't just murder and kill. There's an order and a higher power that we answer to. We can answer to ourselves. No. You listen to me. You listen to me. You said we have to kill in order to stay alive. Now I've killed two perfectly good specimens and all you can do is bitch about it. I don't get it. We're alive two hours and what, you want to die? Brooke, if you don't get it under control, - I'll-- - you'll what? You will do as I say. We are very special. And you will treat our powers as such. Got it?

Actually, we just came from a new year's party. We thought we'd stop by the mini-mart to seduce a handsome man like yourself. We just want to do it in the dark. What, do you think I fell out of the womb yesterday? Huh? What's your name? Don't worry about my name. Come on. I'm not gonna bite. Listen, if you guys Rob me, I get fired, okay? Getting fired should be the last thing on your mind. Now what's your name? Uh, Dan. That's perfect. That's the perfect name. Dan. I like you, Dan. Do you like what you see, Dan the man? Hey, Dan, is there any way of locking this front door? She doesn't want anyone to see what's gonna happen, Dan. Brooke, I'm telling you right now to stop. But I want Dan. Yeah, she wants me. - Is that so? - Yeah. Leave him alone, Brooke. I'm telling you, this is the worst I've ever seen, till. Looks like these bodies were chewed from head to toe. Shoe, are you kidding me? This is how I have to start my new year's? All right, close the goddamn highway down, okay? I'll grab cook and we'll be on the way. Cook, we got a shitstorm going in pearblossom. Let's roll! So, uh, how'd you two get all banged up? Mmm, don't worry about it, Danny boy. You've got so much energy. What's a girl to do? Uh, well, um, uh-- I don't get off till 6:00, so-- mmm. I don't think I can wait that long. How busy is this place? Uh-- uh, well, you know, it's-- it's new year's day, so I don't know. Everyone's really pretty much hung over. I bet I don't get a customer till noon. Is that so? So where are you ladies from? Dan, could I have a moment with Brooke? Oh, yeah yeah. You two chicks can just do whatever the hell you want. I'm just pleased as piss you didn't Rob me. You know, there's a lot of, uh-- there's a lot of weird shit that happens around here. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Like what? - Uh-- you know, people, um-- people turn up dead. Really? Yeah. Yeah, like freaky dead, too, you know? It's been happening for years. Most of the dead people are just travelers passing through, but once in a while, a local gets it. Weird. So they get a local every once in a while, huh? Dan: Yeah. A lot of people think it's wolves or something, but, you know, I don't want to scare you two off or anything. I don't scare too easy. Can I talk to you for a moment... In private? I'm just having a little fun. I'm going to be very vulnerable in a matter of hours. What's that look? I feel the pain of your mistake. What do you mean? Rhea! What are you doing? You're gonna kill me! I could so get on that shit. I'm so sorry. It's just so I can survive the day. Well, fucking ask next time. What did this? Some sort of animal? Animal or human, who in the hell knows? All I know is this is gonna cause one big friggin' ruckus. So let's downplay the situation. All right? Whoo. God damn. It's like some animal came along and ate these poor bastards. Well, sir, I don't see how you can downplay this. Just get 'em covered up before they start attracting flies. Jesus Christ. Nothing left for the flies to eat. Honey, I really have to go to the bathroom. Why don't you say it again? Tell me again like it is the first time I've heard it. Hello, I'm tava smiley. On this episode of "they died before their time," we take a look at actor Warren James whose last and final breath came new year's Eve, 1968 in this poolhouse right here. His brutal murder was discovered just past midnight in the home of producer Arthur mant during a new year's Eve party. You guys are really into this. - You know it's a rerun. - Smiley: That same evening two other party guests-- rhea Cohen and Brooke anchel mysteriously disappeared. Coincidence? I think not. Carrie, in your words, can you tell us what happened that night? Well, I was just about to make love to him when Brooke stormed in. She was out of control and she started stabbing him in the neck several times. That must have been very difficult to witness. Carrie: She told me if I told anybody else, I was next. I think she was just jealous. Can you believe that bitch? - Shh. - Smiley: After police examined the body, it was clear he had 87 puncture wounds in his neck and upper torso. This was no accident. "They died before their time" will be right back. Like I said, it's a rerun. I don't know what the big deal is. I don't believe it. Look at what he's done to me. And that bitch lying just to get her 15 minutes. Is she? I wish I could go back and kill that son of a bitch all over again. I've been robbed of my life. No! You've been given another one, even after you did something so horrible. You really believe that girl? You stabbed him 87 times! - Are they lying? - I hate this life. I want to go back to the beginning and start all over. Whoa whoa whoa. Let's just settle down. - All right, ladies? - What's the matter, Dan? - Are you scared? - Brooke! What happened to Dan the man who can? That is enough, Brooke. Stay out of this, rhea. This is between me and Dan. You still want to get up in this shit? You want to play with me the way I like to play with you? Hey, that was just a phrase. Is it? This isn't between you and Dan. You killed Warren and those guys on the highway. And I will not let you sacrifice another life. What's that supposed to mean? It means I gave you a gift. And if you abuse it, I will have no choice but to take that gift away. Stay out of this, rhea. You guys are freaks. Freaks, Dan? Vampire might be a better term. Yeah, well, I don't believe in vampires. Neither do I. What is wrong with you? Aren't you angry? Don't you want your life back? What has gotten into you? Hasn't anything I've said made any sense? It's nice to finally see you, rhea. It's like you've been asleep since the day we met. Don't test me, Brooke. I will take your life if I have to. This is your fault. You're the one that ran into the desert and turned us into these freaks. This is the way it is supposed to be. Can't you forgive me just one last time? I know the real story with Warren. I've seen and felt the real you. And I'm sorry. I can't keep looking the other way. You can't take me. Don't you feel anything? Brooke: I am done feeling. You're weak. You haven't got the strength 'cause you won't make the kill. Brooke. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Let's go, folks. Keep it moving. There you go. - We don't want to see this. - I waited my turn. I'm taking my look. Better produce a stiff after a wait like that! Nothing to see here, sir. Move along please. - This is all you've got? - Woman: Knock it off. Like I said, there's nothing to see here. Move it along. Pretty small police presence for this kind of hold-up. Would you knock it off? Look at him. Boop boop. Jackass. Thank you. Move it along. There you go. Maybe it's you who's got things confused. I don't think there is a higher power. I think we are who we are and that is that. I should've said goodbye to you a long time ago. And that girl's story-- it's true. But he deserved it. Oh, Danny boy! Where oh where is my Danny boy?! You know, this place isn't that big. I'm gonna find you. Where do you think you're going? You are a clever one. What, did you read that in some silly comic book? What's a girl to do, Dan, stuck in here until dark? So if I kill you now, I'll be left bored. And we can't have that now, can we? You think they're open? Well, the sign says "always open." I'll be right back. All right. - You guys want anything? - No. Hey! Easy on the doors! Gee! Liz, remember that. Guys hate that. Sure thing. Mental note logged. Hello? Hello, is anybody here? Dan: Yeah, I'm just over here cleaning up. We, uh-- we had a big party here last night. Oh, uh, do-- do you have a restroom? Uh, no. No, it's broken. I really need to go. Do you have an employee restroom or something? Lady, you're gonna have to find somewhere else, okay? It's broken! Good boy. Boy! That was quick. Honey, I think something's wrong. It was really weird in there. What do you mean "weird"? - Do they have a bathroom? - No, he said it was broken. The place is a mess. I think something's really wrong. Are you overexaggerating? Okay, let's go take a look. Liz, you need anything? Just a new set of parents. Yeah, that'd be great. Keep it up... ...and I'll be your dorm roommate when and if you get into college. Right. Why won't this thing lock? I told you-- it takes a key and the owner's got it. We're always open like the sign says. We don't ever lock it. I'm too tired for this, Dan. Move her behind the counter. If we are lucky, we will make it to barstow before dark. - Honey? - What? Be careful. You get this from your mother, you know that. Whoa! Jeez! You scared me, man! My wife filled my head with craziness. So you got a bathroom or what? No. I told you, it's broken. Oh, nonsense. I'm sure we can figure that out. Come on, honey. Oh! Must have been some new year's party in here, huh? Hey, looks like you guys have some cleaning up to do. Hey, what about that bathroom, huh? What is it, clogged or something? Tell you what-- give me a second. I'm gonna go in there and take it on myself. Gotta get this show on the road if you know what I mean. We know what you mean. Don't we, Dan? Yeah, we do. What about the plunger-- where is it at? It's in the bathroom. Oh yeah, come on, honey. Boy, you must've had a whopper in here. Your life just keeps getting extended and extended. I wonder how long it'll last. Please just let me go, okay? I'm not gonna tell anybody, I promise. Promises are always broken, Dan. Now get rid of these people and we'll discuss it. Get over there and act like you're cleaning up. And don't do anything stupid. I don't know if I could stomach this guy, if you know what I mean. Awww-- what is he talking about? Toilet is just fine. Okay, honey, give it a quick shake, okay? I'm gonna go grab a snack. Nothing about those two seemed a little strange to you? Yeah, maybe. Who knows what goes on in these small towns? It could be his sister for all I care. Let's just get on the road, it's getting late. Just stand outside the door, will you? - Okay. - Thanks. Why in the hell aren't you back here? You've been out there all goddamn day. Listen, I'm just working over here. Come on, shoe. Get your ass back here. Oh, little man sure knows how to waste a day. Anyway, this is the ground we have to cover. We got a rest stop six miles north of town. We got one six miles south of town. You and I take the north, shoe takes the south and this is the circle we've got to cover. - All right? - I don't mean to sound pessimistic, but wouldn't it help to have at least a few more bodies covering such a large area? I've been running this town for 30 years. - Everything is just fine. - Fine. Yeah. All quiet as usual. Right, sir? You like this job, cook? Keep it up. So what do you recommend, uh, red pepper possum, teriyaki venison or your standard beef? - Any thoughts? - Why don't you try the possum? It's very popular out here. Oh, you don't say? Hmm. Whoo! It's got a kick to it. Well, what the hell? Possum it is. Gonna need a soda to wash this down. Maybe I could get that for you. Gonna have a look for myself, little lady. Don't exactly know what goes with possum. Mmm-- oh! Got it. Okay, how much do I have to pay so I can get out of here? Uh-- uh-- hey, i-- i-- I'm not-- I'm not into any of your-- your local humor, okay? Uh, I just, uh-- I just want to get out of here. You don't work at murder world. I am murder world. Dude, I think she's a vampire! Run! Ow, you biting bitch! Hey! Oh-ho. Help! Help! Look at my face. No more mistakes, right, jerky man? Look at me! Look at me! Pat, come on out! I am gonna kill you and kill you and kill you. Stay away from me, you freak! - I'm ready. - Pat! Pat! - Don't make any sudden move! - What? Look at what you did to me. Had to get a soda with your fucking jerky. You're an annoying piece of shit and a dead man. I should have let you get it. What are you talking about? You freak! You couldn't die enough to make me happy. And one last thought-- I'm gonna spend till dark nursing on your wife's dead carcass. Hey! Hey! Shoe over loudspeaker: Wait there. Wait there. Felix dude, I've been bit by a freaking vampire, okay? And listen, she's still in there. And there's people in there. You gotta do something, okay? Hey, whoa whoa whoa whoa. Slow down now. - What's going on? - I told you. I've been bit by a vampire. Look! Look at my leg! Look! See? Dan, what have you been smoking? No, Felix, come on, dude. You've gotta believe me. Okay, these two chicks-- they came into the store, they closed all the blinds and they've been holding me hostage all day. And they're freaking crazy man, okay? - Now, look-- - shut the fuck up and listen to me! This one girl, she killed the other one right in front of me. Okay? Right in front of me! You've gotta call an ambulance. - I'm starting to feel faint. - Are they still there? What have I been saying?! Yes! Okay? Oh, and listen, the one girl-- she can't go in the light. It messes with her. - Hang tight, someone's coming. - No! No! I'm out of here! Fuck that, dude! - I've gotta run! - Dan! - Dan! Dan! - Screw you, Felix! Tillman, are you there? It's shoe. What now, shoe? Yeah, I'm down the road from murder world and apparently our suspect is inside. - One more time? - You heard me correct, sir. Our suspect is inside. It seems that Dan griggs-- you know the clerk down here at murder world mini-mart-- is out of his mind. He's running down the road. He said that the suspect is female and that she's a vampire, sir. And you are hearing me correct-- - a vampire. - Vampire? Shoe, I don't need this kind of crap. Shoe: I know, I know. I'm just gonna check it out. Well, make it fast because we've got real business to take care of. All right, but in the meantime, send somebody for Dan, will ya? Hello? Till? Aw, crap. Look at you. You're so beautiful. I've really screwed up. I don't know what I'm doing. My face-- I've ruined everything. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just want to go home. It's okay, honey. I'm a police officer. It won't open. - It won't open. - All right, just sit tight. I'll be right back. It's an honor and a job. Honor and a job. Shoe: Hello! Hello! Anybody in here? Hello! I know you're in here, so you need to make yourself visible. Slowly raise your hands in the air. Oh my shit. Oh my shit. Oh shit shit shit. This is pearblossom police! If anyone is in here, you need to raise your hands and show yourself! Sir? Sir? Brooke: Not too good a shot, huh, little man? Brooke: By the way, you're gonna need a silver bullet to finish this job. The police will be here in minutes. If you know what's good for you, you're gonna show yourself and come quietly. Brooke: You think you can handle me? Let's see what you've got. Brooke: Are you ready, little fella? Die, little man! Brooke: How does it feel to take someone's life? Who's gonna die next? I'll answer that when you take your last breath. Why don't you say that to my face? That's what I thought. In order to kill and not feel guilty about it, you must have no reason to live. Don't move. You think you're in a position to give orders? Don't take one more step or I will shoot. And what if I don't die? Then I kill you. You hear that? More people are coming. And how is that going to help you? I mean it. Don't take another step. Tension builds. Isn't this exciting? I can't wait to see what's gonna happen next. Are you gonna shoot me? Am I gonna die? Questions questions-- I know your outcome. Stings a little, but I wouldn't say it hurts. Looks like you needed the silver after all. I don't see anything here. I don't know what shoe was talking about. Holy shit! Come on, man. Come on, please. Don't die on me. Come on, Felix. He's gone. This ends now. There's a girl in this vehicle, sir. Well, then go watch the child in the car! That's where a woman belongs anyway! You're an asshole, sir. Probably so. Probably so. Liz: Open the door! Please! Open the door! Sweetie, I need you to lay down in your seat. - Open the door, please. - Lay down in your seat, okay? Whoever you are in there... Why don't you come out and try this shit on a full-sized man?! Come on! Come on! Go ahead. Take one more step. If you insist. You fucking bitch! You killed my little friend shoe! No! Tillman! No! - It's you. - Shh. You're gonna be okay. Remember, I'm always with you. You're always safe with me. Your knowledge is your power. But...

Tim, all I've done is love you the best I know how and you treat me like shit! - I want to go home! - Fine! If that's what you really want, the second we get there, I'll put you on a plane. Now what? Turn your lights off, asshole! I can't believe this. Hey, we're kind of in the middle of something here. Dickhead. Is everything all right, handsome? Yeah, everything's fine. Just talking, that's all. Do you mind if I come over and say hello? This is kind of personal. - You're quite a specimen. - Yeah? You like what you see? Oh, I like. Come on, Tim. Let's go. Why would you go anywhere with this man? - Oh my god. - What are you? What am I? I'm someone that's lost their entire life because of some little prick like you. - Now what was I saying? - Please. I didn't do anything to you. What makes you think I'm gonna do something? I don't know. Please, my boyfriend's a really great guy, you just-- can you please let him out of the truck and please don't hurt us? You're alive. More than you know. - I'm so happy i-- - don't even. Life's funny, Brooke. You never really see yourself as who or what you are until your entire sense of being is a question of right or wrong. What is your problem? Life is a precious thing that you must respect. What life? We're dead. We may live forever, but at the same time we are dead. We are dead! I love you. You don't know what love is. We could start over-- a new beginning. Brooke, you've made me start over too many times. In the face of the lord, I will rid the world of evil and all those who wish others harm.
