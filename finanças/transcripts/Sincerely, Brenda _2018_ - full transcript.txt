- Thank you. - Hey. Hey old man! - What can I do for you? - I know who you are. You thought I'd forgotten? - Do it, do it! - Charles. Oh, Charles. Brenda. Jeez, what happened to your lip? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? - I was in a fight. - A fight, how'd you get in a fight? - I'm okay, I'm fine. - Charles. Charles, have you been drinking? - No. - Charles, I can smell it. Don't lie to me. Why didn't you call me? - I bought a bottle but I poured it out. - You bought a bottle and you poured it? 10 years of sobriety, Charles. It only takes a moment to go back. I lost five years when Frank died. - Here we go. - Charles. Brenda is gone. How did this really happen? - I deserved it. - Do you need me to stay? - I'm fine. - You need to call your boys, Charles. You need to tell them about their mother. - I know. It's been a long time. - Call them, Charles. - I know, I know. I will. - Here, come here, let me do it. - Grace, I've tied a Windsor knot before. I know what I'm doing. - Well, tonight it doesn't have to be a Windsor. - Yes it does. - No it doesn't. Come here. You know, tonight is a really big night for you. - Yeah, I know. - I mean, you have worked so hard for this. Enjoy it. - I will. Thank you. And you have no idea what you're doing. Windsor knot, Grace, come on. - Okay, look, I have a solution. - Really. - Yes. Trust me. Surprise! - What's that? - Look at it. I wanted to wait till after the ceremony, but I can't, I'm just too excited. - Gross Grace. - Gross, did you even look at it? - It's a pee stick in a bag. - Well, read the pee stick. - Well, I'm guessing since you went through the time to put it in a bag that we're probably-- - Pregnant! You're not excited. - What? No, I am, I'm excited. - I'm trying not to get too excited, 'cause it's too early, you know? - Yeah. - Everything's gonna be okay, right? - Everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be okay, all right? Right, okay. - I'm proud of you, baby. - You know, everything's gonna be different now that I'm partner. You understand that, right? - I know what I'm signing up for. Isn't that your father? Answer it. - Hello? Hi. Yeah, I'm good, how are you? What? How? Yeah, don't worry about it, I'll call. Yeah. Okay, bye. My, my mom died. We have to go to Lansing tomorrow. - When are we coming back to see him? Is it true what people are saying? - I don't know what people are saying. - Is that why he's in prison? Mom? - Lower your voice. - My friends keep telling me that he killed that girl. Mom, mom! - Boy, what? - When are we going back to see dad? - We're not going back. That ain't no place for you and your little brother to be visiting. Now stop asking me all these questions. - It's not fair. - Boy, if you don't shut up. - I hate you. - You know, I never wanted you. I never wanted any of this. Donovan, life isn't fair. And the sooner that you figure this out, the easier it'll be. Wipe them tears outta your face. Your daddy's gone, you a man now, you understand me? Do you hear me? - Yes ma'am. - I'll say something. We, took this picture the day before Frank died. Frank's my husband. He died of a sudden heart attack. I won't be long winded. But Brenda was there for me during my darkest moments. Always there. She never judged me, never criticized me. I'll miss you, Bren, and I love you. - I'll say something. I didn't know Brenda. But Donovan is a great man. So I think she had something to do with it. And you too, Charles. Anyway, I'm glad to be here. Even though it's a sad occasion. But I'm excited to get to know you all better. - It's like a doctor's office up in here. Grace is beautiful. - Thanks. - I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the wedding. - Couldn't or didn't, Charles? It's two different things. Like, I called Michael about Brenda several times, and he's still not here, where is he? It's so disrespectful. I told him even if it was about money I would help him. - Yeah, he's been through a lot. - Yeah, well I've been through a lot too, Charles, and I'm still here. - Your letters, they helped me make it through when I was away. I know that couldn't have been easy with your mother. I appreciate it, thank you. I've been, been doing good. I'm recovered, I haven't had a drink in 10 years. - That's great Charles. Good for you. - Donny, I know I made some bad choices. - Charles, let's not do this today, please. - I know I wasn't the best father for you and Michael. - What are you doing, man? - I'm trying to open up. - Open up? This is not the time to. I can't do this with you right now. - We made it to the state finals. Can you come to my game? - Donovan, you know I can't come to any of your games. - You never make it to my games. - Boy, you know I work. I'm too tired to be sitting up there with all them screaming Negroes. - You didn't work tonight. - Donovan. - You could have come tonight. - You don't need me there. You got your coach, your friends, and all them little girls cheering for you. What you need me there for? What you need is for me to keep a roof over your head. - Oh my God, are you kidding me? - What are you talking about? - These trophies. - Grace, I told you I played basketball. - Yeah, but you didn't tell me you did all this. - Because it's not a big deal. It's just trophies. - Baby, you don't talk about this stuff. These accomplishments. - Because it doesn't matter. - Don't do that, don't shut me out. You need this. You need this time, you need this opportunity with your family to make things right. - You have no idea what you're talking about. - Yes I do. - No you don't. - There are things you don't know about me too. You know, things that I don't tell you. - Oh, you mean like how you used to be a stripper? - You wish! What was she like, your mother? One good memory. - Well. Every Saturday, Soul Train would come on. And she loved Don Cornelius. For years, she would always put on this yellow dress. And force me and Michael to sit down and watch her dance. She would always have this look on her face, this I don't care about the world kind of look. Just pure joy. I used to think she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Then, one day it all stopped. The dancing, the singing, the music. It all just stopped. - A moment of transparency. Was that so hard? - Well, that's all you're getting, so I hope you enjoyed it. - My father had an outside family. One day, this woman shows up on our doorstep with his 14 year old son and eight year old daughter, demanding money. In that moment, it was like my entire reality was just ripped away from me. I didn't know who my dad was. And my mother was so in love with him. She forgave him and accepted his second family. - Did you ever forgive him? - Eventually. What did she do to you? - She. - You don't have to tell me right now. We are not our parents. We're better. And she is going to be better than us. - She? - Yes, she. God spoke to me. - Oh, God spoke to you, okay. Well, God spoke to me too, and he said, we're having a boy. So apparently you're listening to the wrong God. Why are you laughing, 'cause that's what he told me. He said, Donovan, we're having a boy. And I said, okay, cool, God. - I don't know what God you're talking to. This is a girl. - No, shut up, we're having a boy. - This is a girl. - No, it's a boy. - Give me my girl. It's a girl. - Why would it be a girl? We don't need, I can't deal with that. You know I can't deal with that. - You're gonna have to get ready. - Okay, yeah. What was that? - I don't know. - Stay here. - I'm coming with you. - Stay here. - I just want to say, can you hear me? Donny. - Keep your voice down. It's my brother, this is my big brother. Say hi, darling. - What's the matter with you, man? - What's the matter with you? You're not happy to see me? I mean, God, Donny, how long has it been? Five, 10, 15, I don't have enough fingers, Donny. I've missed you. It's been a real long, long. I almost cussed in the house of the Lord. - This ain't a church. - Excuse me, who are you? Who is that? - I don't know, who am I? - I've been calling her Valerie the whole night. - What is going on? - Go back to bed, Grace, it's fine. - Grace, you're Grace, right. - It's a hell of a first impression you're making, man. - You're so serious. It'll all be better in the morning. Trust me. - Um, excuse me. Do one of you guys mind giving me a ride? There seems to be no Ubers available. - Can I borrow your car? - Come on, Grace. - Thanks. Nice meeting you, Grace. Valerie, let's get you home, girl. - What'd you call me? - You're driving though. Tiffany. Donny ruined the party, he's a party pooper, let's go. - You were a dope photographer. - Were? - Yes, were. You know, before you sold out. - Whoa, sold out? - Before all the celebrity cover shoots and models. All this fake stuff. It's not you. - Really. And you just know me so well. - I used to study your stuff. Your early work, your raw stuff, the real stuff. You could always find such beauty in the void. What happened? - Real don't pay the bills. - Seriously, what happened? - Mikey? I thought that was you man. - Lonzo. - What's going on, little Mikey. Little snotty nosed Mikey. How you been doing brother? - Better, man. - I bet. Mr. Hollywood, yeah, models, sun, beaches. The models. - You really like that word, don't you? - Yeah man, I'm saying all the reasons why you ain't been back home. - It's not even like that. - Hey now, listen, what you doing home? - Brenda died, man. - What? How? - Car accident. - Man, I'm sorry to hear that. I was just talking to her last week. How you doing man? - I don't know. - Well, how's your dad? How's Donovan, man? Now, where is Donovan? - I don't know. He here though, so. - He here though. - Yeah. - All right man. - Scratch that, what's good with you? - Oh man, you know, I'm good man, I dabble. You know, making some moves. Legal moves, no, legal moves man. - Right. - Boy, don't look at me like that. - I know you, Lonzo. - No, I'm on the up and up now, man. Listen, listen, we need to talk. Because I've been thinking about moving out to Hollywood, all right. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, I got some ideas. So I need to holler at you. Yeah, it's like, you know what I'm talking about, man. - I got you. - We could partner up. We could, you know, do a few things man. You know what I mean? - For sure. - You know what I mean, right? - Yeah we can see what you do. - Hey man, listen. Since you been back, you talked to Denise? No? Well, you need to. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah, she's singing at Gregory's now. And she good too. - I'll check that out. - Listen, get down there as soon as you can. - There go your boy. - My boy? - Yeah. - Donovan in the flesh? - Are you kidding me? - Oh man! - What's up bro? - What's up? - How you been? Oh, good to see you, man. - Good to see you too. - Hey, tag team's back again! ♪ Whoop there it is ♪ ♪ Whoop there its ♪ ♪ Boom shaka laka ♪ - Y'all are so lame. - Shut up man. - Yeah, whatever. - Hey, this is my wife Grace. And this is my good friend. - His only friend. - Shut up. - My good friend Lonzo. - The one and only. - Hey, watch yourself. That's my wife. - I see why I didn't get an invite to the wedding. - Yeah, about that man. It was a small wedding. - So small I didn't even get an invite. - Now listen. Mikey just told me what happened with your mom, I'm sorry to hear that. We're praying for y'all. All right? - I appreciate that, man. Thank you. - Let me get out of here. - All right. Love you man. - I love you too. - Yeah, good to see you, bro. - Ideas, I got you. - All right, 'zo. - All right. - Thanks. - Thank Grace. - Thank you. - Sure. - Look, I'm sorry about last night. - It's no problem. - Grace! - Will you accept the mission? And I'll stop bullying you. - Brenda! Mama! - Now, we're gonna go around the house, and we're gonna look for dad's magic juice, okay? If you scream again. - Donovan, Donovan, I got it. - Oh my God, Michael! Oh my, it's been, Charles, how long? - A long time. - It's been a long time, look at you, so handsome! Do you remember me? - I could never forget my first crush, Miss Clarice. - Oh boy, stop. Look at you, LA must be treating you well. - Yes, ma'am. I'm doing all right for myself. - All right. - We thought, we thought we'd have some food. And sit down. Chat about lost times. - Lost times. That's what you call them? - You know what, let me take these in the house. I'll see you guys in the house. - Yes ma'am. - All right. - You look good. I'm recovered. 10 years. - My memory is 100 times better than yours. - Oh, my memory's bad, you hear what she's saying? - 100 times, wow. - 100 times. You're welcome. - Charles. Stop that, now it's uneven. You see that, Grace, it's uneven. - Mr. Charles, it's all about the presentation. - Thank you. - Nobody here but us. - It's tradition, right? - Tradition. - I've gotta teach my sone not to do this. Now look at, now look at. Oh, you welcome to it. You know what? - Yeah, rub it in. - Delicious! - You know what, take your grown self over there and grab me some salt. - Uh-oh. Somebody didn't get frisked at the border. - Oh, Charles, I'll take that. - No, that's okay. - Charles. Give it to me. - I'm fine. - Give it to me. - It's mine! Why so shocked? We're celebrating, right? Isn't this the party starter? Here's to Donny and Grace. Wonderful marriage. That's good, Charles. But, 10 years of being sober, that's just, that's just fantastic, isn't it? You can do better. Let's not forget the real reason we're here, right? Brenda. Brenda. Who took the easy way out. Carry on. - Found another. I dare you to taste it. - No! - Come on, taste it. - No. - Taste it! But you a baby. - No I'm not. - Yeah, you are. - Gimme this. - Whoa! - What? - Why did you bring alcohol into this house, man? - We're all grown, Donovan. And honestly, I thought Charles was still a drunk. I figured he would appreciate some fine whiskey. Times have changed. - You know what, times have changed. Look at you, man! You haven't changed at all. The world does not revolve around you, Michael. - Why are you even here? - What? Our mom died, man. She died, that's why I'm here. But the real question is, why weren't you here? - Doesn't matter, I'm here now. - Dinner's almost ready. You can come, whatever, I don't care. - Hey, why you acting like everything is okay? - Everything is okay, Michael. - It's not. Look, denying the truth doesn't change the facts, Donovan. - Most righteous and eternal father, we thank you for allowing us to be together today. Even though the circumstances are not the best. We still praise your name. Thank you for taking care of my sons, and allowing us to be together under one roof. I pray continually for their coverage. I thank you Lord for protecting them when I was not able to. We praise your name. We praise your power. And your mercy, and your justice. In the name of Jesus Christ, bless this food and the hands that prepared it, amen. - Amen. - Amen. - So you're religious now? - I prefer spiritual. - There's a difference? - Yes, there is. - Don't imitate him. - I've been on a spiritual path. To find a higher power. God. When I was in Alcoholics Anonymous. - Your father has set such a remarkable example of strength and perseverance. Because being an alcoholic-- - I am not an alcoholic. - And how's that working out? - Okay, I'm sorry. A recovering alcoholic. - Recovered. Recovered, I prefer recovered. Recovering, that term locks you into a perpetual cycle of negativity. And I can't subscribe to that. - Okay, okay. Well, he hasn't had a drink in 10 years. - Wow, that's wonderful. - All because of spirituality? - And discipline. And faith, and prayer. A lot of prayer. - Where was this spirituality when I was a kid? I'm just curious. - Mike! - I'm just kidding. Listen, really, lighten up. You know, we're celebrating, right? Let's eat. - Hey, do you boys know how your parents met? - No actually. - No, well you know what, I'll tell the story. - Let me tell it. - No, I tell it better. - Tell the story. - Okay. Okay, well Charlie and I were friends first, longtime friends. And then Brenda and I became friends long before she ever met Charlie. So you all follow? - So mutual friends? - Yes, exactly. So, total transparency here, I had a crush on him. - Hey now. - What? - Okay. Back in the '70s, disco and rollerskating was a thing. And Brenda and I were coldblooded on some skates, honey, and we looked good doing it. I had this signature pair of hot pants I used to wear. - Excuse me, hot pants? - Hot pants, girl. You know the little tight short shorts, you all call them daisy dukes. I would glide around that floor with my sexy long legs. - She thought she was hot stuff. - Oh, I knew I was hot stuff. And your father thought he was all that too. - I had to have my sugarfoot fro, and muscles. - Oh no, I think you're recalling somebody else's memory. Anyway, I had invited Charles to skate with me. I was gonna ask him out that night. I don't think I ever told you that. - No you didn't. - Okay, anyway. Brenda shows up, wearing this absolutely beautiful yellow flowing dress, just gorgeous. Your mother was always so beautiful, and she had this smile. That was just electric. So anyway, Charlie finally shows up. Locks eyes with your mother. Now, he didn't even know she was with me. He just sees this beautiful girl floating around the rink, smiling. I didn't even exist anymore. He just watched her all night, but wouldn't say a word to her. - What's the matter, Charlie, didn't have any game? - No I didn't need to say anything. I was a good skater too. So I just rolled over there, took her by the hand, and we danced. - Lies, please, it didn't even happen like that. - I still remember the song. - Oh yeah? - Anita Ward, Ring my Bell. ♪ You can ring my bell ♪ ♪ Ring my bell ♪ - And she fell in love. - Something like that. A year later, Donovan was born. - What was he like? - Just like any other kid. - See, he never talks about this stuff to me. What was he like? - He was determined. And caring. And relentless. When he wanted something, he would get it. Even if he didn't know how to, he'd figure a way out. I remember when he was seven, this was just before Michael was born, a kid down the block had this dirt bike. - The cherry red BMX dirt bike. I remember that. - And Donny wanted it. He just cried and cried because we said no. - I did cry. - And Michael was on the way, and the bills were piling up, we didn't have any extra money. Anyway, Brenda used to make these cinnamon rolls. So she had made a whole bunch of these rolls for a party she was going to. So Donny snuck in the kitchen, took about a dozen of these rolls, marched on down the block and started negotiating with this kid. Do you remember that? - I remember that, yeah. So I told him that I would give him unlimited cinnamon rolls if he gave me his bike. And he did. - And so, did you uphold your end of the bargain? - Yeah, I did, and Brenda was so mad at me. I got in so much trouble. She was so mad because she had to make cinnamon rolls every month for like a year. - That's the kind of kid he was. - See, you never tell me stuff like this. - What was I like, Charles? - You were quiet, shy. Once you got behind that camera, you came alive. And look at you now, making a living with it. - Snapping pictures. - Yeah, there's a little more to it than that. - You were a mama's boy. Always up under Brenda. Sometimes, I used to think I didn't have anything to do with bringing you into the world. - What are you doing right now, huh? And what is all this? Why are you putting on a show? - What do you mean? - Prayers, reminiscing about happier times, times that I don't even recall as being very happy. - Michael, come on, man! - You don't even know me, Charles. You barely knew Brenda! - Hang on a second. - You didn't know her well enough to know that she did not want to be cremated. She didn't believe in it. But look at her, a pile of dust while y'all sitting around the table laughing and talking about cinnamon rolls. Man, I'm out. - Michael. - I just want a minute alone. - I know, I just wanted to... You can smoke bro, that's cool. - When'd you stop smoking? - When I met Grace. She hates it, you know? Our relationship literally hinged on it. - So what'd you replace it with? - Guns. - Guns. - Yeah. - What, did you collect them? - No, no, I shoot 'em. You know, like at a range. But Grace doesn't know, so. - Go ahead. It's funny, man. I remember you gave me my first cigarette in the back yard. - Yeah man, you threw up all over my J's too. - Them boys were clean too. - You got so sick, bro. - They were horrible. - I remember Brenda came out and she saw them, and she was like, ain't nothing a little bleach can't fix. - Bleach. - I was so mad. I did not want to bleach those things. Then she made us smoke a whole pack, thinking that would create some kind of aversion. - Didn't work. - Obviously. - I wonder if she suffered. Brenda, she's just been running through my mind, over and over again. Do you think she deserved it? - You asking me or you telling me? - Hey, Donny, we didn't exactly win the parent lottery. - I don't know, man. I think they did the best they could, you know. - Keep telling yourself that. - What are you doing man? - What? - You know what I mean. What was that at dinner, what was that? - Donny, like, two days of prayer and a dinner don't make up for 22 years. I mean, he trying to clear his conscience or tick off some little box on his little 12 step program. I don't have time for that man, he can miss me with that nonsense. - Why you so angry man? - You should be too. - Listen to me, Michael. When I went away, I left everything in the past. All behind me, it's done. It's through man. - Smoke and mirrors. Smoke and mirrors. - Did you enjoy dinner? - I did. - Well, good. - Thank you so much. - It's so nice to meet you. - It's so nice meeting you too. - You know what, why don't you go in there and relax. We've got this. Seriously, go on Grace, sit down. We got this. - Well, thank you guys for everything. - Oh, no problem. - She's a sweet girl. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Charles, we've been friends for 30 plus years. I know that look, what's wrong? - You know, he wasn't lying. - Who? - Michael, when he said I don't know him, I don't. - Charles, the good thing is the both of you are still breathing. - Clarice, I got that feeling. It's all coming at me too fast. Brenda, and the boys, and Abigail. - I know. - I've been praying. God ain't listening. - He's listening, but all you're doing is talking. Maybe if you slowed down, you'll get what you need, Charles. - The only time I slowed down was in a bottle. - Oh, Charles. Charles. You know, the moment I decided to quit drinking, Maurice was 10. It was three years after his father died, and I was supposed to be taking him to a friend's birthday party. But I wanted to get wasted instead. He was so mad. I had made a promise to him. But I chose my addiction. He stormed out of the house angry. I passed out. I remember waking up to the police knocking at my door. And I answered, confused. All I remember was them saying that my baby had been hit by a car. I didn't hear anything else after that. You know, that's why they say this life is nothing but the sum of our choices, Charles. And that's why we have to choose wisely. So you need to choose wisely. Here. You finish up these dishes. I got a long day tomorrow. - Thank you, my friend. - Always, Charles. - I wear it like my complexion. A cocoa brown hue that has a deeper story. Painted all over me like the mirror's reflection. She is my guilt. She is my glory. For who would I be without her imposing on my every decision? Like a misty fog distorting my vision of who I could really be if I had not lived a life with guilt as my guide. - Grace? - I can't sleep. - Either can I. - Guilt has built me. Brick by brick and stone by stone, I have been built and rebuilt again, and still I've made guilt my home. - She's beautiful. - Yes she was. She's angry at me. You can't tell by looking at her face. See the way she's touching her elbow? - Yeah. - That's what she used to do when she was upset. It was an unconscious tic. Maybe a warning. - What did you do to her? - Many things. - Well, they couldn't have been all bad. - This is just before I went away. - Where did you go? - Prison. This is the part where you say, why'd you go to prison, Charles? - Well, it doesn't matter why. You're here now, right? - That's Abigail Johnson. Pretty little girl. Every year since I've been out, I go by and see her mother. I never get out and talk to her. I just sit there. Not a day goes by that I don't imagine what she could have become. Today's the anniversary of the accident. I just wish I could go back. - If only we could all go back and change things. - Hey, baby, we're just watching old home movies. - Let's go, Grace. - Donovan, we're talking. - I'm not asking. - Son. - We're leaving in the morning. - Donovan. - Why did you have to tell her that story, man? - Because it happened, Donovan. It happened. I prayed for you boys, for years. I prayed to God to take care of you. Because I couldn't. - You know, I appreciate your prayers, but I needed more than that, man. I needed you. I needed you. - There's nothing about me that my guilt don't know, she listen so cunningly and hangs onto my every word. How could I let her go? - Are we going to address the elephant in the room? - There's an elephant? - There is definitely an elephant. You used to be married once? - Excuse me? - I do my research. - You call going through my stuff research? Where's the journalistic integrity in that? - Wait, wait, I wasn't planning on writing about you. - Now, Adriana, I'm serious. Get your stuff and get out. - You all are in for a treat. You all are going to love and adore the beautiful soulful sounds of Denise. - Can I get a whiskey, neat, please. - ID please. - Give a warm round of applause for Miss Denise. - Thank you. So. I'm gonna switch it up just a little tonight. Y'all don't mind if I do me for a bit, do you? - Come on girl. - Good. You enjoy the music? - Yeah, it was dope. You did a pretty good job, I was feeling it. If you ever need some photos, album artwork, or promotional materials, just let me know. You know I got you. You still photogenic. - Still? - Yeah, still photogenic. - Oh wow, no way. - Yeah, you remember that day? - Our first date. - Yeah. I found this in my room. - Goodness. You know what, you're still somewhat of a decent photographer. - Oh, so you follow my work. - Well, yeah, I might have looked you up on Facebook once or twice. - So you approve then? - I approve. - But, more importantly, you've been Facebook stalking me. - Whatever. Whatever, whatever, whatever. - You know, Denise, I, I really missed you. - I've, let's not ruin the vibe. Okay, we got a good vibe going right now. - You haven't missed me at all. - Michael, seriously. - Denise, come on. - Why did you come here tonight, Michael? For closure? - I really missed you. I missed your smile. You know, I needed to see that right there. That's what I needed to see. I flew all the way to Michigan just for that. - Why did you leave? - You wouldn't understand. - No see, I've asked myself that question for years. Trying to make sense of it. So, I need you to help me understand. You owe that to me. We were two months from our wedding. I was ready to be with you for the rest of my life. Hey you! Yes, yes, yes, the show was great, I killed it as usual. Yeah, I am ready. Okay. I'll be out front. I love you too. Bye. I need to go. - Is that your boyfriend? - Fiance. - Do you love him? - I do. - Do you? - I have to go, and that means you too. So. - It's your favorite, I remember. No, no! - You need to go to bed, Michael. - Let me pour you another drink. It'll be good for you. Don't be rude, Charles, have a drink with me. - This isn't helping you. - Okay. Don't think. I forgot that you cremated her. Yeah, all she, all she ever wanted was a traditional burial. You hated her. - I didn't hate her. - Oh stop lying. - I loved her like I love you. - Liar! Don't be rude, Charles, come on, have a drink. - You hear that? Donovan, I heard talking. - You don't know what I went through. - I know what you went through. - You don't know, you weren't here. - I couldn't be here. And I'm sorry. - Donovan! - I know you Charles, better than you know yourself. - It's Michael. - It's always Michael. - It's your fault that I'm like this. I defended you. Day after day after day. Being talked about, being chased around, having rocks thrown at me, I fought for you! But you weren't here to protect me. - I'm sorry. - Stay here, Grace. - No, I'm coming with you. - Grace, how many times to I gotta tell you, this does not concern you. Please. - It does concern me. It concerns both of us. - Stay here, please. - I'm coming. - I said stay here! - Let's just have a drink together. Father and son. Just have a drink, all right? We both know you want to. - Come on man, stop it, what are you doing, bro? - Donny, yes. Have a drink with us, Donny. - Come on man. It's been a long weekend for everybody. Let's just go to bed man. - Don't, don't do that to me! Don't you patronize me. - It's okay, Donny. - Look at it, is this okay, huh? Is this okay, I am sick of this! - There he is. - Shut up. - It took awhile, but you finally showed up. - Shut up. See this is the reason that I left, you understand that? - You're just like her. Yeah, you been running from it, but you can't run from who you are, Donny. - I am nothing like her. - You've been running your whole life. You couldn't wait to leave me here. - Are you kidding me, man? I went to college. What was I supposed to do? Sit around here and rot like everybody else? Man, you are so narcissistic man! You had no idea what I did for you. - Man you were never, ever much of a brother. - Are you kidding me? - I was. When Charles went to prison, who was there? I was. And when you had your nightmares, and you couldn't sleep at night, who was there, Michael, I was. - Donny. - And who was there for me, huh? Who was there for me? - Donny, Donny. - Get off me! Are you kidding me man? Is this what you wanted, huh? - What you gonna do now, what you gonna do now, Donny? - I'm so sick of you, sick of you! - Let's do this. What, what, say something, say something. You're not big and tough now. Get off me, man! What's wrong with you? - Donovan. - What? - You think I'm that little boy? - Grace, Grace! Grace, oh my God. Look at me, look at me, it's gonna be okay, all right? Charles, call 911. It's gonna be all right, it's gonna be all right. All right, just calm down, it's gonna be all right. Charles, dad! Call 911. - Right. - All right, it's gonna be okay. - Thanks. - So I'm going to be a grandfather. - I never should have come here. - You got any names picked out? I imagine Grace had the name before you all even met. I had your name picked out before you were even a thought. Donovan. Dark warrior. My fighter. I knew I was gonna have a boy first. You didn't come into the world easy. You and your mother almost died. Most terrifying experience of my life. - Asher. - Out of Asher his bread shall be fat. And he shall yield royal dainties. - It means blessing. I chose the name because I just wanted him to be something different. You know? I wanted him to be better. - He will be. - But maybe it's not meant to be. - What's not meant to be? - We lost three babies, Charles. Three. And this time, I don't know, I just. I feel like it's my fault. - The last time your mother came to visit me, she came to tell me to never come around you all again. I agreed to stay away. I was wrong. But your mother, she loved you the best way she knew how. You're not like your mother. You're not like me. You came through us, but you're not from us. Donnie, you will be a great father. - Sir, you can go see her now. - Are they okay? - Everything's gonna be fine. Come with me. - Why would she keep these from me? It doesn't even matter, 'cause it's just words. It's just a pile of words, of broken dreams, hopes and apologies, and regrets. Just a whole bunch of nonsense, just nothing. Just a pile of nothing. - I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for these words. - Yeah, well, these words couldn't stop me from getting my tail whipped every day at school. They couldn't stop the nightmares. I see her. Abigail? That night just plays over and over. And over in my head. You were so drunk. Worse than I'd ever seen. You turned and you smiled at me. You never smiled at me like that before. Do you remember? - You're old enough to drive. You wanna drive? - I guess, I guess. - Here, put your hand here, right there. There you go. All right, now watch the road. Hey, put your other hand right here. Good, good, you're doing it, you're doing it. Okay, stay right in the middle of the lane. Don't let go. All right, you're doing it. It's all you. - She came out of nowhere. - Dad! Dad! - These words can't fix that. They can't fix that I killed that girl. They can't fix that it was all my fault, they can't fix that, that she's dead. They can't fix that. - It's not your fault, you were just a child. - I killed that girl. - You didn't. - I killed her, it was all my fault. It's all my fault. A day did not go by that I wish I could go back. She's not here because of me. And then you left me. You left me. I didn't know what to do. - I'm so sorry. - I just wanted a dad. - Good morning, Charles. I have something for you. Brenda wrote it, she planned on giving it to you in person. - She knew I was clean? - Of course, old timer. I was just waiting on the right moment to give it to you.
